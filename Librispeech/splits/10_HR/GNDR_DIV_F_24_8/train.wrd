WHERE HE ALREADY KEPT A SCORE OR SO OF SIMILAR BALLS WHICH SO FAR AS COULD BE DISCOVERED
MARILLA DIANA AND ANNE FLED OUT THE LATTER PAUSING ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO SET THE PRECIOUS PLATTER HASTILY DOWN ON THE SECOND STEP OF THE STAIRS WHEN THEY REACHED THE PANTRY A TRULY HARROWING SPECTACLE MET THEIR EYES
LET'S CARRY THE THINGS IN AND GET IT OVER IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT THAT DINNER WAS A NOTABLE SUCCESS SOCIALLY THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY EXERTED THEMSELVES TO SAVE THE SITUATION AND MARILLA'S CUSTOMARY PLACIDITY WAS NOT NOTICEABLY RUFFLED
SHE PROMPTLY AGREED TO GIVE TWENTY FIVE AND MISS SARAH LOOKED AS IF SHE FELT SORRY SHE HADN'T ASKED FOR THIRTY WELL I GUESS YOU MAY HAVE IT I WANT ALL THE MONEY I CAN SCARE UP JUST NOW THE FACT IS
WHICH FACT HAD NECESSITATED THE BUILDING OF A STONE BASEMENT UNDER ONE END THE HOUSE AND OUT BUILDINGS WERE ALL WHITEWASHED TO A CONDITION OF BLINDING PERFECTION AND NOT A WEED WAS VISIBLE IN THE PRIM KITCHEN GARDEN SURROUNDED BY ITS WHITE PALING
SHE CARRIED THE PLATTER CAREFULLY TO THE FRONT DOOR WHERE HER GUESTS WERE ENJOYING THE COOL BREEZE THAT BLEW UP FROM THE BROOK IT WAS EXAMINED AND ADMIRED THEN JUST AS ANNE HAD TAKEN IT BACK INTO HER OWN HANDS A TERRIFIC CRASH AND CLATTER SOUNDED FROM THE KITCHEN PANTRY
SAID DIANA TRYING TO CONSOLE THE GUESTS WENT AWAY SOON AFTER FEELING THAT IT WAS THE MOST TACTFUL THING TO DO AND ANNE AND DIANA WASHED THE DISHES TALKING LESS THAN THEY HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO DO BEFORE THEN DIANA WENT HOME WITH A HEADACHE
AND LOOKED MORE EXCITED THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN KNOWN TO LOOK BEFORE AT HALF PAST TWELVE THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY CAME EVERYTHING WAS GOING WELL BUT ANNE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL NERVOUS IT WAS SURELY TIME FOR PRISCILLA AND MISSUS MORGAN TO ARRIVE
BUT COULDN'T BE DEPENDED ON TO REMAIN SO FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'RE COMING AFTER ALL SAID MARILLA CROSSLY ANNE AND DIANA SOUGHT COMFORT IN EACH OTHER'S EYES AT HALF PAST ONE MARILLA AGAIN EMERGED FROM THE PARLOR
TWENTY DOLLARS SAID ANNE WHO WAS NEVER MEANT TO MATCH BUSINESS WITS WITH A COPP OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE OFFERED HER PRICE AT THE START WELL I'LL SEE SAID MISS SARAH CAUTIOUSLY
WE'LL HAVE A BIG VASEFUL OF WILD ROSES IN THE CENTER AND ONE SINGLE ROSE IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY'S PLATE AND A SPECIAL BOUQUET OF ROSEBUDS ONLY BY MISSUS MORGAN'S AN ALLUSION TO THE ROSEBUD GARDEN YOU KNOW
WITH ALL THE ZEST GONE OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE I DON'T BELIEVE I'LL BE ABLE TO EAT A MOUTHFUL SAID DIANA DOLEFULLY NOR I
FOR HAD SHE NOT IN KEEN REMEMBRANCE OF MANY SIMILAR SNUBS ADMINISTERED IN HER OWN EARLY YEARS SOLEMNLY VOWED THAT SHE WOULD NEVER TELL ANY CHILD IT WAS TOO LITTLE TO UNDERSTAND YET HERE SHE WAS DOING IT
OR TILL TOMORROW SUGGESTED DIANA IF THEY'RE NOT BACK BY SUNSET YOU'LL HAVE TO GO FOR OTHER ASSISTANCE I SUPPOSE SAID ANNE RELUCTANTLY BUT YOU MUSTN'T GO UNTIL YOU REALLY HAVE TO
ANNE SLANTED BACK HER PARASOL AND WAVED AN ENCOURAGING HAND TO HER FRIEND BUT CONVERSATION AT THAT DISTANCE WAS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION FINALLY THE RAIN CEASED THE SUN CAME OUT AND DIANA VENTURED ACROSS THE PUDDLES OF THE YARD
I'VE GOT THE PLATTER AND THAT RAIN HAS LAID THE DUST BEAUTIFULLY SO ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL WE'RE NOT HOME YET SAID DIANA RATHER PESSIMISTICALLY AND THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT MAY HAPPEN BEFORE WE ARE YOU'RE SUCH A GIRL TO HAVE ADVENTURES ANNE
WHERE THE CHICKENS WERE ALREADY SIZZLING SPLENDIDLY ANNE PREPARED THE POTATOES AND DIANA GOT THE PEAS AND BEANS READY THEN WHILE DIANA SHUT HERSELF INTO THE PANTRY TO COMPOUND THE LETTUCE SALAD ANNE WHOSE CHEEKS WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO GLOW CRIMSON
MADE OF THE USUALLY DISMAL LITTLE ROOM
BUT IT'S WORTH TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IT'S A VERY OLD PLATTER DIANA GAVE ANNE'S FOOT A GENTLE KICK UNDER THE TABLE MEANING DON'T AGREE SHE'LL LET IT GO FOR TWENTY IF YOU HOLD OUT BUT ANNE WAS NOT MINDED TO TAKE ANY CHANCES IN REGARD TO THAT PRECIOUS PLATTER
THANKS EITHER TO THE LEMON JUICE OR TO THE UNUSUAL FLUSH ON HER CHEEKS WHEN THEY WERE READY THEY LOOKED QUITE AS SWEET AND TRIM AND GIRLISH AS EVER DID ANY OF MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES I DO HOPE I'LL BE ABLE TO SAY SOMETHING ONCE IN A WHILE
GIRLS WE MUST HAVE DINNER EVERYBODY IS HUNGRY AND IT'S NO USE WAITING ANY LONGER PRISCILLA AND MISSUS MORGAN ARE NOT COMING THAT'S PLAIN AND NOTHING IS BEING IMPROVED BY WAITING ANNE AND DIANA SET ABOUT LIFTING THE DINNER
BUT SINCE I'VE HAD YOU AND THE TWINS TO BRING UP I DON'T FEEL SO SURE OF IT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MISS BARRY'S PLATTER PAY HER BACK THE TWENTY DOLLARS SHE PAID FOR IT I SUPPOSE I'M SO THANKFUL IT WASN'T A CHERISHED HEIRLOOM BECAUSE THEN NO MONEY COULD REPLACE IT
AND DIANA HAVING MADE A HASTY PILGRIMAGE AROUND THE HOUSE RETURNED TO ANNOUNCE THAT A VERY BLACK CLOUD WAS RISING RAPIDLY IN THE NORTHWEST I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HEAVY THUNDER SHOWER SHE EXCLAIMED IN DISMAY
IT WOULD BE EVEN WORSE THAN THE TIME I HAD TO CONFESS ABOUT JUMPING ON THE SPARE ROOM BED BOTH GIRLS LAUGHED OVER THE OLD MEMORY CONCERNING WHICH IF ANY OF MY READERS ARE IGNORANT AND CURIOUS I MUST REFER THEM TO ANNE'S EARLIER HISTORY
SHE SAID AS SHE GINGERLY STEPPED ON THE ROOF
YOU'VE GOT THE DEAREST DIMPLES AND IF I HAVE A FRECKLED NOSE THE SHAPE OF IT IS ALL RIGHT
AND SEE A GIRL'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS STICKING OUT OF THE ROOF OF ONE OF THEIR OUTHOUSES LISTEN IS THAT A WAGON
THAT SHE COULD HARDLY SEE ANNE THROUGH IT HOLDING THE PARASOL BRAVELY OVER HER BARE HEAD THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF THUNDER BUT FOR THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR THE RAIN CAME MERRILY DOWN OCCASIONALLY
BUT ANNE AND DIANA BETWEEN THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT AND THE REACTION FROM THEIR EXCITEMENT OF THE FORENOON COULD NEITHER TALK NOR EAT ANNE TRIED HEROICALLY TO BEAR HER PART IN THE CONVERSATION FOR THE SAKE OF HER GUESTS BUT ALL THE SPARKLE HAD BEEN QUENCHED IN HER FOR THE TIME BEING
SHE MADE FREQUENT TRIPS TO THE GATE AND LOOKED AS ANXIOUSLY DOWN THE LANE AS EVER HER NAMESAKE IN THE BLUEBEARD STORY PEERED FROM THE TOWER CASEMENT SUPPOSE THEY DON'T COME AT ALL SHE SAID PITEOUSLY DON'T SUPPOSE IT
FOR BY THE TIME AUNTY'S ANKLE IS WELL SHE WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO TORONTO SHE HAS TO BE THERE BY A CERTAIN DATE WELL SIGHED ANNE
BUT IN MOMENTS OF EXCITEMENT IT'S SURE TO POP OUT ANNE IF I WERE TO SAY I SEEN BEFORE MISSUS MORGAN I'D DIE OF MORTIFICATION AND IT WOULD BE ALMOST AS BAD TO HAVE NOTHING TO SAY I'M NERVOUS ABOUT A GOOD MANY THINGS SAID ANNE
DAVY SLIPPED AND CAME SPRAWLING SQUARELY DOWN ON THE LEMON PIES HIS CLEAN BLOUSE WAS RUINED FOR THAT TIME AND THE PIES FOR ALL TIME IT IS HOWEVER AN ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NOBODY GOOD
THE GIRLS REACHED SPENCERVALE AND TURNED DOWN THE TORY ROAD A GREEN SOLITARY HIGHWAY WHERE THE STRIPS OF GRASS BETWEEN THE WHEEL TRACKS BORE EVIDENCE TO LACK OF TRAVEL ALONG MOST OF ITS EXTENT IT WAS LINED WITH THICK SET YOUNG SPRUCES
DAVY HAD TO CLIMB ON THE TABLE AND REACH OVER TO THE SHELF AT A DANGEROUS ANGLE SOMETHING HE HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN BY MARILLA TO DO AS HE HAD COME TO GRIEF ONCE BEFORE IN THE EXPERIMENT THE RESULT IN THIS INSTANCE WAS DISASTROUS
BUT I WAS TIMID AND FRIGHTENED OF FATHER BESIDES I DIDN'T KNOW MEN WERE SO SKURSE WHEN THE GIRLS WERE SAFELY AWAY DIANA DRIVING AND ANNE HOLDING THE COVETED PLATTER CAREFULLY ON HER LAP
DID YOU GET VERY WET SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY OH NO RETURNED ANNE CHEERFULLY MY HEAD AND SHOULDERS ARE QUITE DRY AND MY SKIRT IS ONLY A LITTLE DAMP WHERE THE RAIN BEAT THROUGH THE LATHES
FOR MARTHA COPP HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO KEEP ANYTHING SHE COULD SELL BUT IF THEY WON'T THERE'S A PLATTER AT WESLEY KEYSON'S AT SPENCERVALE AND SHE KNOWS THEY'D SELL IT BUT SHE ISN'T SURE IT'S JUST THE SAME KIND AS AUNT JOSEPHINE'S
AND SAW FLASHES OF LIGHT COMING THROUGH THE TWILIGHT FROM DIANA'S WINDOW IN GROUPS OF FIVE WHICH MEANT ACCORDING TO THEIR OLD CHILDISH CODE COME OVER AT ONCE FOR I HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO REVEAL ANNE THREW HER WHITE SHAWL OVER HER HEAD
FOR IT WOULD NOT DO TO DON IT UNTIL ALL THE DINNER PREPARATIONS WERE COMPLETED MEANWHILE SHE WORE HER AFTERNOON PINK PRINT AND A LAWN APRON FEARFULLY AND WONDERFULLY RUFFLED AND FRILLED AND VERY NEAT AND PRETTY AND ROSY SHE WAS
OH DEAR THIS IS A DREADFUL PREDICAMENT I WOULDN'T MIND MY MISFORTUNES SO MUCH IF THEY WERE ROMANTIC AS MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES ALWAYS ARE
A CONSTRUCTION OF LATHES WITH A PEAKED ROOF WHICH HAD IN TIMES PAST SERVED AS A HABITATION FOR DUCKS THE COPP GIRLS HAD GIVEN UP KEEPING DUCKS BECAUSE THEY WERE SUCH UNTIDY BIRDS
IT SEEMS TO ME ANNE THAT YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO OUTGROW YOUR FASHION OF SETTING YOUR HEART SO ON THINGS AND THEN CRASHING DOWN INTO DESPAIR BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET THEM I KNOW I'M TOO MUCH INCLINED THAT WAY AGREED ANNE RUEFULLY
CROWDING DOWN TO THE ROADWAY WITH HERE AND THERE A BREAK WHERE THE BACK FIELD OF A SPENCERVALE FARM CAME OUT TO THE FENCE OR AN EXPANSE OF STUMPS WAS AFLAME WITH FIREWEED AND GOLDENROD WHY IS IT CALLED THE TORY ROAD ASKED ANNE
SAVE AS AN ABODE OF CORRECTION FOR SETTING HENS ALTHOUGH SCRUPULOUSLY WHITEWASHED IT HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT SHAKY AND ANNE FELT RATHER DUBIOUS AS SHE SCRAMBLED UP FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A KEG PLACED ON A BOX I'M AFRAID IT WON'T BEAR MY WEIGHT
WHILE THE TWILIGHT RAINED DOWN OUT OF A DAPPLED SKY I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THAT MISSUS MORGAN SHOULD REALLY COME BUT THERE THAT SPEECH SOUNDS AS PESSIMISTIC AS MISS ELIZA ANDREWS AND I'M ASHAMED OF MAKING IT
SO WE'LL HAVE DINNER AT ONE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN TWO HAPPIER AND MORE EXCITED GIRLS SOMEWHERE IN CANADA OR THE UNITED STATES AT THAT MOMENT BUT I DOUBT IT EVERY SNIP OF THE SCISSORS AS ROSE AND PEONY AND BLUEBELL FELL
AND THE DUST ON THE ROAD WAS SUCH AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED AFTER SIX WEEKS OF DRY WEATHER OH I DO WISH IT WOULD RAIN SOON SIGHED ANNE EVERYTHING IS SO PARCHED UP THE POOR FIELDS JUST SEEM PITIFUL TO ME
AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE HAD CRASHED THROUGH THE ROOF UP TO HER ARMPITS AND THERE SHE HUNG QUITE UNABLE TO EXTRICATE HERSELF DIANA DASHED INTO THE DUCK HOUSE AND SEIZING HER UNFORTUNATE FRIEND BY THE WAIST
AND IN SPITE OF HER LOVE FOR THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY SHE COULDN'T HELP THINKING HOW NICE IT WOULD BE WHEN EVERYBODY HAD GONE HOME AND SHE COULD BURY HER WEARINESS AND DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE PILLOWS OF THE EAST GABLE THERE IS AN OLD PROVERB THAT REALLY SEEMS AT TIMES TO BE INSPIRED
FOR MAYBE NOW MARTHA WILL AGREE TO HAVING IT TAKEN DOWN SHE NEVER WOULD BEFORE FOR FEAR IT MIGHT COME IN HANDY SOMETIME AND I'VE HAD TO WHITEWASH IT EVERY SPRING BUT YOU MIGHT AS WELL ARGUE WITH A POST AS WITH MARTHA SHE WENT TO TOWN TODAY I DROVE HER TO THE STATION
ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD HOPELESSLY NO THE SPLINTERS HURT TOO BADLY IF YOU CAN FIND AN AXE YOU MIGHT CHOP ME OUT THOUGH OH DEAR I DO REALLY BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT I WAS BORN UNDER AN ILL OMENED STAR DIANA SEARCHED FAITHFULLY
IF BOTH WERE EQUALLY OLD AND GENUINE MARILLA LOOK AT THAT BIG STAR OVER MISTER HARRISON'S MAPLE GROVE WITH ALL THAT HOLY HUSH OF SILVERY SKY ABOUT IT IT GIVES ME A FEELING THAT IS LIKE A PRAYER AFTER ALL WHEN ONE CAN SEE STARS AND SKIES LIKE THAT
FOR SHE HAD PAID TWENTY DOLLARS FOR IT THE PLATTER HAD SERVED ITS PURPOSE AT THE AID BAZAAR AND HAD THEN BEEN RETURNED TO THE GREEN GABLES CLOSET FOR ANNE WOULD NOT TRUST ANYBODY BUT HERSELF TO TAKE IT BACK TO TOWN
SPREAD THE WRAPPING PAPER ON A SHINGLE DIANA HANDED UP AND WROTE OUT HER GARDEN IDYL UNDER CONDITIONS THAT COULD HARDLY BE CONSIDERED AS FAVORABLE TO LITERATURE NEVERTHELESS THE RESULT WAS QUITE PRETTY AND DIANA WAS ENRAPTURED WHEN ANNE READ IT TO HER OH
I'VE LIVED HERE FOR SIXTY YEARS AND I'VE NEVER BEEN ON THE POND YET WELL IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND SAID ANNE ROGUISHLY SUPPOSE YOU COME WITH US TOMORROW WE'LL SHUT GREEN GABLES UP AND SPEND THE WHOLE DAY AT THE SHORE DAFFING THE WORLD ASIDE
I THINK IT ALMOST PAYS FOR THE THUD WELL MAYBE IT DOES ADMITTED MARILLA I'D RATHER WALK CALMLY ALONG AND DO WITHOUT BOTH FLYING AND THUD BUT EVERYBODY HAS HER OWN WAY OF LIVING I USED TO THINK THERE WAS ONLY ONE RIGHT WAY
SAID MARILLA WHO HAD LISTENED TO THIS DIALOGUE WITH A RATHER GUILTY EXPRESSION I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D REMEMBER ABOUT THE SUGAR ANNE FOR I'M PERFECTLY CERTAIN YOU NEVER DID BEFORE SO I PUT IN A SPOONFUL
HELD A SHEAF OF BLUEBELLS THE DARK CORNERS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE GRATE WERE LIGHTED UP WITH JARS FULL OF GLOWING CRIMSON PEONIES AND THE GRATE ITSELF WAS AFLAME WITH YELLOW POPPIES
SAID MARILLA PUSHING HIM TOWARD THE HALL WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR DESSERT ASKED ANNE LOOKING REGRETFULLY AT THE WRECK AND RUIN GET OUT A CROCK OF STRAWBERRY PRESERVES SAID MARILLA CONSOLINGLY
FINALLY THE MORNING DAWNED PEARLY AND LUSTROUS IN A SKY FULL OF SILVER SHEEN AND RADIANCE AND THE WONDERFUL DAY HAD ARRIVED DIANA APPEARED SOON AFTER BREAKFAST WITH A BASKET OF FLOWERS OVER ONE ARM AND HER MUSLIN DRESS OVER THE OTHER
EXCEPT AT SUCH TIMES AS THEY CLUNG TO UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE'S BUTTONS EVEN ANNE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO INFUSE MUCH GRACE INTO IT FOR MARILLA WOULD NOT PERMIT ANY ALTERATIONS BUT IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT FLOWERS CAN ACCOMPLISH IF YOU GIVE THEM A FAIR CHANCE
WHICH WAS FULL OF AIRY SHADOWS AND WAVERING GOLDEN LIGHTS WE'LL DECORATE THE PARLOR FIRST WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
SAID MISS SARAH AMIABLY YOU NEEDN'T WORRY THERE'S NO HARM DONE THANK GOODNESS WE COPPS KEEP OUR PANTRIES PRESENTABLE AT ALL TIMES AND DON'T CARE WHO SEES INTO THEM AS FOR THAT OLD DUCKHOUSE I'M GLAD IT'S SMASHED
I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN FOR YOU IN THE WAY OF TEA BUT I WARN YOU NOT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT BREAD AND BUTTER AND SOME COWCUMBERS MARTHA LOCKED UP ALL THE CAKE AND CHEESE AND PRESERVES AFORE SHE WENT SHE ALWAYS DOES BECAUSE SHE SAYS I'M TOO EXTRAVAGANT WITH THEM IF COMPANY COMES
WHERE'S DAVY SAID MARILLA WITH AN INDIFFERENT GLANCE AT THE STAR IN BED
BUT NO AXE WAS TO BE FOUND I'LL HAVE TO GO FOR HELP SHE SAID RETURNING TO THE PRISONER NO INDEED YOU WON'T SAID ANNE VEHEMENTLY IF YOU DO THE STORY OF THIS WILL GET OUT EVERYWHERE AND I SHALL BE ASHAMED TO SHOW MY FACE
ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD OH NO IT WOULDN'T BE SUITABLE AT ALL THERE IS NO PLOT IN IT YOU SEE IT'S JUST A STRING OF FANCIES I LIKE WRITING SUCH THINGS BUT OF COURSE NOTHING OF THE SORT WOULD EVER DO FOR PUBLICATION
JUST TO SHOW THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING DIANA'S FATHER WAS A LIBERAL FOR WHICH REASON SHE AND ANNE NEVER DISCUSSED POLITICS
AND THE TREES SEEM TO BE STRETCHING OUT THEIR HANDS PLEADING FOR RAIN AS FOR MY GARDEN IT HURTS ME EVERY TIME I GO INTO IT I SUPPOSE I SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT A GARDEN WHEN THE FARMERS CROPS ARE SUFFERING SO
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT FOR GIRLS I S'POSE BUT I WANT SOMETHING EXCITING LOTS OF KILLING AND SHOOTING IN IT
AND I SAW MARY SENTNER FROM SPENCER VALE IN MISTER BLAIR'S STORE SHE SAYS THE OLD COPP GIRLS ON THE TORY ROAD HAVE A WILLOW WARE PLATTER AND SHE THINKS IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE WE HAD AT THE SUPPER SHE SAYS THEY'LL LIKELY SELL IT
DIANA HASTILY DRAGGED IN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED KEG AND ANNE FOUND THAT IT WAS JUST SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO FURNISH A SECURE RESTING PLACE FOR HER FEET BUT SHE COULD NOT RELEASE HERSELF
MISSUS MORGAN IS COMING TODAY ANNE WONDERED HOW MISTER HARRISON COULD GO ON PLACIDLY MOWING HAY IN THE FIELD ACROSS THE LANE JUST AS IF NOTHING WERE GOING TO HAPPEN THE PARLOR AT GREEN GABLES WAS A RATHER SEVERE AND GLOOMY APARTMENT
MISTER ALLAN SAYS IT IS ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CALLING A PLACE A GROVE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TREES IN IT SAID DIANA FOR NOBODY LIVES ALONG THE ROAD EXCEPT THE COPP GIRLS
I'LL GO RIGHT OVER TO SPENCERVALE AFTER IT TOMORROW SAID ANNE RESOLUTELY AND YOU MUST COME WITH ME IT WILL BE SUCH A WEIGHT OFF MY MIND FOR I HAVE TO GO TO TOWN DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND HOW CAN I FACE YOUR AUNT JOSEPHINE WITHOUT A WILLOW WARE PLATTER
I PUT A SPOONFUL OF SUGAR IN WE ALWAYS DO DON'T YOU LIKE IT
DAVY WAS EMPHATIC ON THAT POINT NOR I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT TO UNCLE RICHARD NEITHER I'D FAR RATHER LIVE HERE EVEN IF MARILLA IS THAT LONG TAILED WORD WHEN IT COMES TO JAM CAUSE YOU'RE HERE ANNE
DON'T PITY ME DIANA FOR I HAVEN'T MINDED IT AT ALL I KEPT THINKING HOW MUCH GOOD THE RAIN WILL DO AND HOW GLAD MY GARDEN MUST BE FOR IT AND IMAGINING WHAT THE FLOWERS AND BUDS WOULD THINK WHEN THE DROPS BEGAN TO FALL
BUT PRACTICAL DAVY WHO AS ANNE OFTEN DESPAIRINGLY REMARKED HADN'T A PARTICLE OF IMAGINATION WAS ONLY PUZZLED AND DISGUSTED
AND NOT SIT LIKE A MUTE SAID DIANA ANXIOUSLY ALL MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES CONVERSE SO BEAUTIFULLY BUT I'M AFRAID I'LL BE TONGUE TIED AND STUPID AND I'LL BE SURE TO SAY I SEEN I HAVEN'T OFTEN SAID IT SINCE MISS STACY TAUGHT HERE
MISS COPP SHE SAID EARNESTLY I ASSURE YOU I LOOKED INTO YOUR PANTRY WINDOW ONLY TO DISCOVER IF YOU HAD A WILLOW WARE PLATTER I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE I DIDN'T LOOK FOR ANYTHING ELSE BLESS YOU THAT'S ALL RIGHT
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE ANY HARM NO I DON'T THINK SO DECIDED ANNE AFTER DUE REFLECTION SINCE OUR MOTIVE IS NOT IDLE CURIOSITY THIS IMPORTANT POINT OF ETHICS BEING SETTLED ANNE PREPARED TO MOUNT THE AFORESAID LITTLE HOUSE
AND OH ANNE DEAR
NO WE MUST JUST WAIT UNTIL THE COPP GIRLS COME HOME AND BIND THEM TO SECRECY THEY'LL KNOW WHERE THE AXE IS AND GET ME OUT I'M NOT UNCOMFORTABLE AS LONG AS I KEEP PERFECTLY STILL NOT UNCOMFORTABLE IN BODY I MEAN
AND EVEN EXTORTED A TRIBUTE OF ADMIRATION FROM MARILLA WHO CAME IN TO CRITICIZE AND REMAINED TO PRAISE NOW WE MUST SET THE TABLE SAID ANNE IN THE TONE OF A PRIESTESS ABOUT TO PERFORM SOME SACRED RITE IN HONOR OF A DIVINITY
WE MUST PREPARE FOR IT SAID ANNE TRANQUILLY A THUNDERSTORM SEEMED A TRIFLE IN COMPARISON WITH WHAT HAD ALREADY HAPPENED YOU'D BETTER DRIVE THE HORSE AND BUGGY INTO THAT OPEN SHED FORTUNATELY MY PARASOL IS IN THE BUGGY HERE TAKE MY HAT WITH YOU
YOU LOOK SIMPLY SWEET SAID ANNE ADMIRINGLY DIANA SIGHED
OF COURSE THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WAS THAT HE MUST BE GOOD BUT HE TRIED TO BE GOOD AND I HADN'T THE HEART TO DISAPPOINT HIM YOU'LL DROWN YOURSELF OR THE TWINS ROWING ABOUT THE POND IN THAT FLAT GRUMBLED MARILLA
ADVISED DIANA AND ANNE ACCORDINGLY LEANED MUCH TO HER DELIGHT SHE SAW AS SHE PEERED THROUGH THE PANE A WILLOW WARE PLATTER EXACTLY SUCH AS SHE WAS IN QUEST OF ON THE SHELF IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW
SHE HAD IN ACCORDANCE WITH HER PROMISE TO MISSUS LYNDE WRITTEN TO MISS BARRY OF CHARLOTTETOWN ASKING FOR THE LOAN OF IT MISS BARRY WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF ANNE'S AND SHE PROMPTLY SENT THE PLATTER OUT WITH A LETTER EXHORTING ANNE TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF IT
BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH FEAR THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO TALK AND TO DO HER JUSTICE THERE WASN'T ANNE SHROUDED HER MUSLIN GLORIES IN A BIG APRON AND WENT DOWN TO CONCOCT HER SOUP MARILLA HAD DRESSED HERSELF AND THE TWINS
FOR EDITORS INSIST ON PLOTS SO PRISCILLA SAYS OH THERE'S MISS SARAH COPP NOW PLEASE DIANA GO AND EXPLAIN MISS SARAH COPP WAS A SMALL PERSON
FINALLY THE GIRLS CAME TO THE OLD COPP HOMESTEAD A PLACE OF SUCH EXCEEDING EXTERNAL NEATNESS THAT EVEN GREEN GABLES WOULD HAVE SUFFERED BY CONTRAST THE HOUSE WAS A VERY OLD FASHIONED ONE SITUATED ON A SLOPE
SHE TURNED HER HEAD AT DAVY'S QUESTION AND ANSWERED DREAMILY OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON DOWN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW PAUL IRVING WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE MEANING OF THIS OR MADE A MEANING OUT OF IT FOR HIMSELF IF HE DIDN'T
I THINK HE ONLY PUT IT ON BECAUSE HE WANTED TO CONCLUDE A BUSINESS DEAL WITH HARMON ANDREWS SAID ANNE I'VE HEARD HIM SAY THAT'S THE ONLY TIME A MAN NEEDS TO BE PARTICULAR ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE BECAUSE IF HE LOOKS PROSPEROUS THE PARTY OF THE SECOND PART WON'T BE SO LIKELY TO TRY TO CHEAT HIM
THE TABLE WAS SET IN THE SITTING ROOM WITH MARILLA'S FINEST LINEN AND THE BEST CHINA GLASS AND SILVER YOU MAY BE PERFECTLY CERTAIN THAT EVERY ARTICLE PLACED ON IT WAS POLISHED OR SCOURED TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE PERFECTION OF GLOSS AND GLITTER
IT NEVER RAINS BUT IT POURS THE MEASURE OF THAT DAY'S TRIBULATIONS WAS NOT YET FULL JUST AS MISTER ALLAN HAD FINISHED RETURNING THANKS THERE AROSE A STRANGE OMINOUS SOUND ON THE STAIRS AS OF SOME HARD HEAVY OBJECT BOUNDING FROM STEP TO STEP
AS IT IS I DARESAY SHE'LL RAISE A FUSS MARTHA'S THE BOSS OF THIS ESTABLISHMENT I CAN TELL YOU I'M GETTING AWFUL TIRED OF LIVING UNDER ANOTHER WOMAN'S THUMB BUT COME IN COME IN YOU MUST BE REAL TIRED AND HUNGRY
IF YOU MEAN ECONOMICAL IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT THING FROM BEING STINGY IT IS AN EXCELLENT TRAIT IN A PERSON IF SHE IS ECONOMICAL IF MARILLA HAD BEEN STINGY SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN YOU AND DORA WHEN YOUR MOTHER DIED
DO YOU SUPPOSE THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN THE GOSSIP THAT MISTER HARRISON IS GOING TO SEE ISABELLA ANDREWS NO I'M SURE THERE ISN'T HE JUST CALLED THERE ONE EVENING ON BUSINESS WITH MISTER HARMON ANDREWS AND MISSUS LYNDE SAW HIM AND SAID SHE KNEW HE WAS COURTING BECAUSE HE HAD A WHITE COLLAR ON
AND SHE WAS RIGHT AS SHE ALWAYS IS DIANA UNTIED THE PONY AND DROVE INTO THE SHED JUST AS THE FIRST HEAVY DROPS OF RAIN FELL THERE SHE SAT AND WATCHED THE RESULTING DOWNPOUR WHICH WAS SO THICK AND HEAVY
MISTER HARRISON SAYS HIS PASTURES ARE SO SCORCHED UP THAT HIS POOR COWS CAN HARDLY GET A BITE TO EAT AND HE FEELS GUILTY OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS EVERY TIME HE MEETS THEIR EYES AFTER A WEARISOME DRIVE
SAID DIANA WHO HOWEVER WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE UNCOMFORTABLE MISGIVINGS ON THE SUBJECT ANNE SAID MARILLA COMING OUT FROM THE PARLOR
FORTUNATELY FOR ANNE MARILLA CALLED OUT AT THIS MOMENT FROM HER ROOM ANNE DIANA'S SIGNALING AT A GREAT RATE YOU'D BETTER SEE WHAT SHE WANTS ANNE RAN TO THE EAST GABLE
THAT IS THE PANTRY WINDOW I FEEL SURE SHE SAID
BELIEVE YOU'RE JUST TALKING NONSENSE
I SET THAT PLATTER THERE AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT I AM PROPERLY PUNISHED FOR MY CARELESSNESS BUT OH WHAT WILL MISS BARRY SAY WELL YOU KNOW SHE ONLY BOUGHT IT SO IT ISN'T THE SAME AS IF IT WAS AN HEIRLOOM
AFTER ALL IT WAS NOT TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THINGS JUST AS GOOD AND FAR BETTER ARE COMING TRUE FOR ME ALL THE TIME AND I SUPPOSE THE EVENTS OF TODAY HAVE A FUNNY SIDE TOO PERHAPS WHEN DIANA AND I ARE OLD AND GRAY WE SHALL BE ABLE TO LAUGH OVER THEM
MAYBE YOU COULD FIND ONE LIKE IT SOMEWHERE AND BUY IT FOR HER I'M AFRAID NOT PLATTERS AS OLD AS THAT ARE VERY SCARCE MISSUS LYNDE COULDN'T FIND ONE ANYWHERE FOR THE SUPPER I ONLY WISH I COULD FOR OF COURSE MISS BARRY WOULD JUST AS SOON HAVE ONE PLATTER AS ANOTHER
I DON'T BELIEVE MISTER HARRISON WILL EVER MARRY HE SEEMS TO HAVE A PREJUDICE AGAINST MARRIAGE WELL YOU CAN NEVER TELL ABOUT THOSE OLD BACHELORS AND IF HE HAD A WHITE COLLAR ON I'D AGREE WITH RACHEL THAT IT LOOKS SUSPICIOUS
WELL LET'S FORGET OUR TROUBLES AND THINK OF OUR MERCIES SAID ANNE GAILY MISSUS ALLAN SAYS THAT WHENEVER WE THINK OF ANYTHING THAT IS A TRIAL TO US WE SHOULD ALSO THINK OF SOMETHING NICE THAT WE CAN SET OVER AGAINST IT IF YOU ARE SLIGHTLY TOO PLUMP
FINISHING UP WITH A GRAND SMASH AT THE BOTTOM EVERYBODY RAN OUT INTO THE HALL
I WONDER WHAT THE COPP GIRLS VALUE THIS HOUSE AT I SHALL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGE I'VE DONE BUT I WOULDN'T MIND THAT IF I WERE ONLY SURE THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND MY MOTIVE IN PEEPING IN AT THEIR PANTRY WINDOW MY SOLE COMFORT IS THAT THE PLATTER IS JUST THE KIND I WANT
WHEN ANNE AND DIANA FINISHED WITH THE ROOM YOU WOULD NOT HAVE RECOGNIZED IT A GREAT BLUE BOWLFUL OF SNOWBALLS OVERFLOWED ON THE POLISHED TABLE THE SHINING BLACK MANTELPIECE WAS HEAPED WITH ROSES AND FERNS EVERY SHELF OF THE WHAT NOT
NOBODY OBJECTED TO THIS AT HALF PAST ELEVEN THE LETTUCE SALAD WAS MADE THE GOLDEN CIRCLES OF THE PIES WERE HEAPED WITH WHIPPED CREAM AND EVERYTHING WAS SIZZLING AND BUBBLING THAT OUGHT TO SIZZLE AND BUBBLE WE'D BETTER GO AND DRESS NOW SAID ANNE FOR THEY MAY BE HERE BY TWELVE
THE NEXT AFTERNOON THE GIRLS FARED FORTH ON THEIR PLATTER HUNTING EXPEDITION IT WAS TEN MILES TO SPENCERVALE AND THE DAY WAS NOT ESPECIALLY PLEASANT FOR TRAVELING IT WAS VERY WARM AND WINDLESS
I REALLY FEEL SORRY FOR MISTER HARRISON
FOR IT HAS TRULY BEEN A BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE A GOOD MANY MORE AND WORSE DISAPPOINTMENTS THAN THAT BEFORE YOU GET THROUGH LIFE
I HAVE HAD MY MOMENTS LADY GEORGINA MURMURED WITH HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE
YOU NEVER WILL LEARN WHAT I MEAN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE LANGUAGE NO NO I AM GOING OUT SIMPLY IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE WHAT ADVENTURE MAY COME I HAVE NOT AT THIS MOMENT THE FAINTEST CONCEPTION
I SAID IN MY SUAVEST VOICE BUT I THINK I SEE A WAY OUT OF YOUR DIFFICULTY MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY WOULD GO OFF IN A FIT OF APOPLEXY
THEN AGAIN ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN'T WAIT TO GET A GRETCHEN AN UNSOPHISTICATED LITTLE GRETCHEN OF THE TAUNUS AT SCHLANGENBAD I SUPPOSE THERE ARE UNSOPHISTICATED GIRLS IN GERMANY STILL MADE IN GERMANY
AND MAKE THE MAN AT THE OFFICE GIVE YOU A NOTE OF IT TO CHECK THOSE HORRID BELGIAN PORTERS THEY'LL CHARGE YOU FOR DOUBLE THE WEIGHT UNLESS YOU REDUCE IT AT ONCE TO KILOGRAMMES I KNOW THEIR WAYS FOREIGNERS HAVE NO CONSCIENCES
NO MADAME I HAVE QUITTED THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE
WE SHALL HAVE TO TAKE IT DOWN AGAIN I DEVISE A PLAN THEREFORE I SUBMIT MYSELF TO FATE OR IF YOU PREFER IT I LEAVE MY FUTURE IN THE HANDS OF PROVIDENCE I SHALL STROLL OUT THIS MORNING
AND HE HANDED IT ACROSS TO HER SHE READ IT AND PASSED IT ON
I THOUGHT THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY WHO WAS A SHREWD PERSON IN HER WAY MUST SURELY SEE THROUGH THIS OBVIOUS PATTER BUT I HAD UNDER ESTIMATED THE AVERAGE HUMAN CAPACITY FOR SWALLOWING FLATTERY
SHE KNEW WHAT I MEANT IT WAS GENTLE AND PENSIVE BUT IT LACKED INITIATIVE SO WHEN WE HAD FINISHED THAT WALL I POPPED ON MY BEST HAT AND POPPED OUT BY MYSELF INTO KENSINGTON GARDENS
AND I SAID TO HER IN MY ICIEST VOICE YOU KNOW HOW ICY I CAN BE WHEN OCCASION DEMANDS IT' THE SECOND OLD LADY NODDED AN UNGRUDGING ASSENT AS IF PERFECTLY PREPARED TO ADMIT HER FRIEND'S RARE GIFT OF ICINESS
THE ADVENTURE OF THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY
FOR A MORE INSOLENT UPSTANDING INDEPENDENT ANSWER YOU BACK AGAIN YOUNG WOMAN WITH A SNEER OF HER OWN I NEVER SAW AMELIA BUT I MUST GET TO SCHLANGENBAD NOW THERE THE DIFFICULTY COMES IN ON THE ONE HAND
I LAID DOWN THE PASTE BRUSH AND MUSED DO YOU REMEMBER ELSIE I SAID STARING HARD AT THE PAPER BOARD WHEN I FIRST WENT TO GIRTON HOW ALL YOU GIRLS WORE YOUR HAIR QUITE STRAIGHT IN NEAT SMOOTH COILS
I KISSED HER FLUFFY FOREHEAD YOU GOOD GENEROUS LITTLE ELSIE I CRIED I WON'T STOP HERE ONE MOMENT AFTER I HAVE FINISHED THE PAINTING AND PAPERING I CAME HERE TO HELP YOU
DO I RECALL HIM CE CHER SIR EVELYN IF I RECALL HIM
HIS WIDOW WENT AND MARRIED THAT GOOD LOOKING SCAPEGRACE JACK WATTS MORGAN NEVER MARRY A MAN MY DEAR WITH A DOUBLE BARRELLED NAME AND NO VISIBLE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE ABOVE ALL IF HE'S GENERALLY KNOWN BY A NICKNAME
AS SOON AS I'VE CLEANED MYSELF AND EMBRACE THE FIRST STRAY ENTERPRISE THAT OFFERS OUR BAGDAD TEEMS WITH ENCHANTED CARPETS LET ONE BUT FLOAT MY WAY AND HI PRESTO I SEIZE IT
WHAT WILL YOU DO TO FIND ONE PUT ON MY HAT AND WALK OUT I ANSWERED NOTHING COULD BE SIMPLER THIS CITY BURSTS WITH ENTERPRISES AND SURPRISES
I NEVER HEARD OF ANY LOIS IN MY LIFE BEFORE EXCEPT TIMOTHY'S GRANDMOTHER YOU'RE NOT ANYBODY'S GRANDMOTHER ARE YOU NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE I ANSWERED GRAVELY SHE BURST OUT LAUGHING AGAIN
AS I WALKED OFF WELL PLEASED LADY GEORGINA'S FRIEND RAN AFTER ME QUICKLY YOU MUST TAKE CARE SHE SAID IN A WARNING VOICE YOU'VE CAUGHT A TARTAR SO I SUSPECT I ANSWERED
THE GIRL HAS SPIRIT SHE REMARKED IN AN ENCOURAGING TONE AS IF SHE WERE DISCUSSING SOME ABSENT PERSON UPON MY WORD AMELIA I RATHER LIKE THE LOOK OF HER WELL MY GOOD WOMAN
LIKE A NATIVE I ANSWERED WITH CHEERFUL PROMPTITUDE I WAS AT SCHOOL IN CANTON BERNE
SO THAT SHE'S ALWAYS CALLING YOU IN TO INTERPRET FOR HER IN HER PRIVATE DIFFERENCES WITH THE FILLE DE CHAMBRE AND THE LANDLORD OR ELSE I MUST PICK UP A FRENCH MAID IN LONDON AND I KNOW EQUALLY BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE FRENCH MAIDS ONE ENGAGES IN LONDON
I CUT OUT HALF HER CLOTHES FOR HER HER OWN IDEAS WERE ALMOST ENTIRELY LIMITED TO DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS AND CUTTING OUT A BLOUSE BY DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS IS WEARY UPHILL WORK FOR A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER
AND ON THE SOUTH BY THE AMPHITHEATRE OF THE ALBERT HALL BUT FOR A CENTRE OF ADVENTURE I CHOOSE THE LONG WALK IT BECKONED ME SOMEWHAT AS THE NORTH WEST PASSAGE BECKONED MY SEAFARING ANCESTORS
THE COUNT ANSWERED AND OGLED HER THENCEFORWARD TO DOVER THEY TALKED TOGETHER WITH CEASELESS ANIMATION THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY WAS CAPITAL COMPANY SHE HAD A TANG IN HER TONGUE AND IN THE COURSE OF NINETY MINUTES
SHE HAS AN AWFUL TEMPER THAT'S NOTHING SO HAVE I APPALLING I ASSURE YOU AND IF IT COMES TO BLOWS I'M BIGGER AND YOUNGER AND STRONGER THAN SHE IS WELL I WISH YOU WELL OUT OF IT THANK YOU
I HAVE SUPPRESSED THE GEORGINA IT OUGHT TO BE MADE PENAL TO SEND INNOCENT GIRLS INTO THE WORLD SO BURDENED MY OPINION TO A T YOU ARE REALLY AN EXCEPTIONALLY SENSIBLE YOUNG WOMAN THERE'S MY NAME AND ADDRESS
I PUT MY FOOT DOWN THERE I WILL NOT TAKE ANY TEMPORARY PERSON I SAW MY CHANCE THIS WAS A DELIGHTFUL IDEA WHY NOT START FOR SCHLANGENBAD WITH THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY
YOU WILL DROP THAT BASKET I HOPE YOU HAVE GOT THROUGH TICKETS VIA MALINES NOT BY BRUSSELS I WON'T GO BY BRUSSELS YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THERE NOW MIND YOU NOTICE HOW MUCH THE LUGGAGE WEIGHS IN ENGLISH POUNDS
I HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA I ANSWERED CONTINUING TO PASTE ONLY AS I CAN'T TRESPASS UPON YOUR ELEGANT HOSPITALITY FOR LIFE
TWO ANCIENT LADIES WERE SEATED ON THE OTHER SIDE ALREADY VERY GRAND LOOKING DAMES WITH THE HAUGHTY AND EXCLUSIVE UGLINESS OF THE ENGLISH ARISTOCRACY IN ITS LATER STAGES
NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD SO DELIGHTFUL AS ENGLAND MONSIEUR IS ATTACHED TO THE EMBASSY IN LONDON LADY GEORGINA INQUIRED GROWING AFFABLE HE TWIRLED HIS GREY MOUSTACHE A WAXED MOUSTACHE OF GREAT DISTINCTION
DO I LOOK LIKE A WOMAN WHO CARES ABOUT A REFERENCE WHAT ARE CALLED CHARACTERS ARE USUALLY ESSAYS IN HOW NOT TO SAY IT YOU TAKE MY FANCY THAT'S THE POINT AND POOR TOM CAYLEY
NOT THE OBVIOUS BEAUTY OF MERE YOUTH AND HEALTH' HE GLANCED ACROSS AT ME DISDAINFULLY THE PROFOUNDER BEAUTY OF DEEP CHARACTER IN A FACE THAT CALM AND SERENE BEAUTY
I SAY CONTINENTAL BECAUSE I COULDN'T QUITE MAKE OUT WHETHER HE WAS FRENCH GERMAN OR AUSTRIAN WHO WAS ANXIOUS IN EVERY WAY TO MEET LADY GEORGINA'S WISHES DID MADAME DESIRE TO HAVE THE WINDOW OPEN OH CERTAINLY WITH PLEASURE THE DAY WAS SO SULTRY
TO SCHLANGENBAD YOU COULD GET A TEMPORARY MAID HER FRIEND SUGGESTED IN A LULL OF THE TORNADO THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY FLARED UP YES AND HAVE MY JEWEL CASE STOLEN
IF YOU DON'T WISH TO BE OVERHEARD YOU OUGHTN'T TO SHOUT BESIDES I DESIRED TO DO YOU A SERVICE THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY REGARDED ME ONCE MORE FROM HEAD TO FOOT I DID NOT QUAIL THEN

TO MAKE UP FOR IT HE TALKED MUCH AND WITH ANIMATION TO LADY GEORGINA THEY FERRETED OUT FRIENDS IN COMMON AND WERE AS MUCH SURPRISED AT IT AS PEOPLE ALWAYS ARE AT THAT INEVITABLE EXPERIENCE AH YES MADAME I RECOLLECT HIM WELL IN VIENNA
THEN SHE SCANNED ME UP AND DOWN AS IF I WERE A GIRL IN A MANTLE SHOP AND SHE CONTEMPLATED BUYING EITHER ME OR THE MANTLE AT LAST CATCHING MY EYE SHE THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND BURST OUT LAUGHING
DEAR LITTLE ELSIE WAS IN TRANSPORTS OF SURPRISE WHEN I RELATED MY ADVENTURE WILL YOU REALLY GO AND WHAT WILL YOU DO MY DEAR WHEN YOU GET THERE I HAVEN'T A NOTION I ANSWERED THAT'S WHERE THE FUN COMES IN BUT ANYHOW I SHALL HAVE GOT THERE
WELL YOU'LL DO I THINK SHE SAID CATCHING MY ARM THAT BIG MILL DOWN YONDER HASN'T GROUND THE ORIGINALITY ALTOGETHER OUT OF YOU
THOUGH IT LOOKS AT FIRST SIGHT LIKE MUDDY FLAGSTONES LONDON THE GREATEST AND RICHEST CITY IN THE WORLD WHERE AN ADVENTUROUS SOUL OUGHT SURELY TO FIND SOME LOOPHOLE FOR AN ADVENTURE THAT PIECE IS HUNG CROOKED DEAR
STILL YOU GO TO SCHLANGENBAD ON MONDAY THAT'S THE POINT ON MONDAY IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE JOURNEY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD ENOUGH TO BE RID OF THE MINX I'M GLAD AS IT IS INDEED

OF COURSE YOU WILL TEACH SAID ELSIE PETHERIDGE WHEN I EXPLAINED MY AFFAIRS TO HER THERE IS A GOOD DEMAND JUST NOW FOR HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS I LOOKED AT HER AGHAST TEACH ELSIE
AND HALF AN HOUR TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE AND SHE DROPPED ME A DEEP REVERENCE AND SHE ANSWERED OUI MADAME MERCI BEAUCOUP MADAME JE NE DESIRE PAS MIEUX MADAME AND OUT SHE FLOUNCED SO THERE WAS THE END OF IT
THOSE LITTLE LIPS COULD NEVER FRAME THEMSELVES TO SCHLECHT OR WUNDERSCHOEN THEY WERE NOT CUT OUT FOR IT PARDON ME I ANSWERED IN GERMAN WHAT I SAY THAT I MEAN THE NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN MUSIC OF THE FATHERLAND'S SPEECH
WITHOUT A FRIEND TO PROTECT A RELATION TO COUNSEL HER I DON'T COUNT AUNT SUSAN WHO LURKED IN LADYLIKE INDIGENCE AT BLACKHEATH AND WHOSE COUNSEL LIKE HER TRACTS WAS GIVEN AWAY TOO PROFUSELY TO EVERYBODY
BY MONDAY I HAD PAPERED AND FURNISHED THE ROOMS AND WAS READY TO START ON MY VOYAGE OF EXPLORATION I MET THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY AT CHARING CROSS BY APPOINTMENT AND PROCEEDED TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER LUGGAGE AND TICKETS
I DON'T OBJECT TO GOING TO SCHLANGENBAD I WOULD CONVOY YOU OVER AS COMPANION OR LADY HELP OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU CHOOSE TO CALL IT I WOULD REMAIN WITH YOU THERE FOR A WEEK TILL YOU COULD ARRANGE WITH YOUR GRETCHEN PRESUMABLY UNSOPHISTICATED
I START ON MONDAY I GLANCED AT HER CARD THE VERY COPPERPLATE WAS NOISY LADY GEORGINA FAWLEY FORTY NINE FORTESCUE CRESCENT W IT HAD TAKEN US TWENTY MINUTES TO ARRANGE OUR PROTOCOLS
IF MY EYES HAD BEEN LIKE ELSIE'S THAT LIQUID BLUE WHICH LOOKS OUT UPON LIFE WITH MINGLED PITY AND AMAZEMENT I MIGHT HAVE FELT AS A GIRL OUGHT TO FEEL UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS BUT HAVING LARGE DARK EYES WITH A BIT OF A TWINKLE IN THEM
A COLD DRAUGHT RUNS SO OFTEN ALONG THE FLOOR IN RAILWAY CARRIAGES THIS IS KENT THAT WE TRAVERSE AH THE GARDEN OF ENGLAND AS A DIPLOMAT HE KNEW EVERY NOOK OF EUROPE AND HE ECHOED THE MOT HE HAD ACCIDENTALLY HEARD DROP FROM MADAME'S LIPS ON THE PLATFORM
AND WHEN LADY GEORGINA'S SALLOW CHEEKS BEGAN TO GROW PALE I WAS STEADY ENOUGH TO SUPPLY HER WITH HER SHAWL AND HER SMELLING BOTTLE SHE FIDGETED AND WORRIED THE WHOLE WAY OVER SHE WOULD BE TREATED LIKE A VERTEBRATE ANIMAL
AFTER THAT HE CARRIED MY DEAR MOTHER OFF TO BURMA AND WHEN HE AND THE CLIMATE BETWEEN THEM HAD SUCCEEDED IN KILLING HER HE MADE UP FOR HIS APPROPRIATIONS AT THE CHEAPEST RATE BY ALLOWING ME JUST ENOUGH TO SEND ME TO GIRTON
YOU HAVE TO WAIT UPON HER INSTEAD OF HER WAITING UPON YOU SHE GETS SEASICK ON THE CROSSING AND WHEN SHE REACHES FRANCE OR GERMANY SHE HATES THE MEALS AND SHE DETESTS THE HOTEL SERVANTS AND SHE CAN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE
AND BEING AS WELL ABLE TO PILOT A BICYCLE AS ANY GIRL OF MY ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE INHERITED OR ACQUIRED AN OUTLOOK ON THE WORLD WHICH DISTINCTLY LEANS RATHER TOWARDS CHEERINESS THAN DESPONDENCY I CROAK WITH DIFFICULTY
LOIS CAYLEY YOU SAY ANY RELATION OF A MADCAP CAPTAIN CAYLEY WHOM I USED ONCE TO KNOW IN THE FORTY SECOND HIGHLANDERS HIS DAUGHTER I ANSWERED FLUSHING
CLOSED A LITTLE MORE PARFAITEMENT THERE WAS A CURRENT OF AIR IL FAUT L'ADMETTRE MADAME WOULD PREFER THE CORNER NO THEN PERHAPS SHE WOULD LIKE THIS VALISE FOR A FOOTSTOOL PERMETTEZ JUST THUS
WHATEVER YOUR GREAT COUNTRY ATTEMPTS WERE IT ONLY A FOG IT ACHIEVES CONSUMMATELY I HAVE QUICK INTUITIONS I FELT THE FOREIGN GENTLEMAN TOOK AN INSTINCTIVE DISLIKE TO ME
THIS IS MY JEWEL BOX IT CONTAINS ALL THAT REMAINS OF THE FAWLEY FAMILY JEWELS I POSITIVELY DECLINE TO APPEAR AT SCHLANGENBAD WITHOUT A DIAMOND TO MY BACK THIS NEVER LEAVES MY HANDS
WELL WELL WE CAN SETTLE THIS LITTLE MATTER BETWEEN US MIND I'M A PERSON WHO ALWAYS EXPECTS TO HAVE MY OWN WAY IF YOU COME WITH ME TO SCHLANGENBAD YOU MUST DO AS I TELL YOU
HAS ON MY INFANT EAR FROM THE FIRST BEGINNING IMPRESSED ITSELF THE OLD LADY LAUGHED ALOUD DON'T JABBER IT TO ME CHILD SHE CRIED I HATE THE LINGO
SHE WORE COFFEE COLOURED POINT LACE IN HER BONNET WITH A COMPLEXION TO MATCH BUT WHAT COULD I DO MY DEAR I SIMPLY COULDN'T PUT UP WITH SUCH INSOLENCE SO I LOOKED HER STRAIGHT BACK IN THE FACE OH SHE QUAILED I CAN TELL YOU
THE BUCCANEERING MARINERS OF ELIZABETHAN DEVON I SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR AT THE FOOT OF AN OLD ELM WITH A POETIC HOLLOW PROSAICALLY FILLED BY A UTILITARIAN PLATE OF GALVANISED IRON
THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE SOME UNNAMEABLE CHARM SOME FAINT TOUCH OF ECCENTRICITY HA I HAVE IT VIENNA A CARRIAGE WITH FOOTMEN IN RED LIVERY A NOBLE PRESENCE
LADY GEORGINA RESISTED HIS INGENIOUS EFFORTS TO GAIN POSSESSION OF HER PRECIOUS JEWEL CASE AS SHE DESCENDED THE GANGWAY SHE CLUNG TO IT LIKE GRIM DEATH EVEN IN THE CHOPS OF THE CHANNEL FORTUNATELY I AM A GOOD SAILOR
BECAUSE I SIMPLY DAREN'T UNDERTAKE TO CROSS THE CHANNEL ALONE AND GO ALL THAT LONG JOURNEY
A FAINT RED SPOT ROSE QUAINTLY IN THE CENTRE OF THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY'S SALLOW CHEEK MY DEAR SHE MURMURED MY NAME IS THE ONE THING ON EARTH I'M REALLY ASHAMED OF
MY PARENTS CHOSE TO INFLICT UPON ME THE MOST ODIOUS LABEL THAT HUMAN INGENUITY EVER DEVISED FOR A CHRISTIAN SOUL AND I'VE NOT HAD COURAGE ENOUGH TO BURST OUT AND CHANGE IT A GLEAM OF INTUITION FLASHED ACROSS ME
I COULDN'T GO ON EATING YOUR HARD EARNED BREAD AND DOING NOTHING I KNOW HOW SWEET YOU ARE BUT THE LAST THING I WANT IS TO ADD TO YOUR BURDENS NOW LET US ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AGAIN AND HURRY ON WITH THE DADO
COMMEND ME TO THE NOBLE DOWAGER
THE IMPERTINENCE OF THE HUSSIES WITH THE BRIGHT RED HAIR
IT IS KIND OF YOU TO GIVE ME THIS WARNING BUT I THINK I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF I COME YOU SEE OF A MILITARY FAMILY I NODDED MY THANKS AND STROLLED BACK TO ELSIE'S
SHE GREW PURPLE IN THE FACE WITH INDIGNATION AND ASTONISHMENT THAT A CASUAL OUTSIDER SHOULD VENTURE TO ADDRESS HER SO MUCH SO INDEED
SO I ACCEPTED MY PLIGHT AS AN AMUSING EXPERIENCE AFFORDING FULL SCOPE FOR THE CONGENIAL EXERCISE OF COURAGE AND INGENUITY HOW BOUNDLESS ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES OF KENSINGTON GARDENS THE ROUND POND
SHE HAD FLAYED ALIVE THE GREATER PART OF LONDON SOCIETY WITH KEEN WIT AND SPRIGHTLINESS I LAUGHED AGAINST MY WILL AT HER ILL TEMPERED SALLIES THEY WERE TOO FUNNY NOT TO AMUSE IN SPITE OF THEIR VITRIOL AS FOR THE COUNT
BUT IF YOU DON'T TEACH ELSIE WENT ON GAZING AT ME WITH THOSE WONDERING BIG BLUE EYES OF HERS WHATEVER WILL YOU DO BROWNIE HER HORIZON WAS BOUNDED BY THE SCHOLASTIC CIRCLE
SHE ASKED I FLUSHED UP IN TURN THIS IS A PUBLIC PLACE I REPLIED WITH DIGNITY AND YOU SPOKE IN A TONE WHICH WAS HARDLY DESIGNED FOR THE STRICTEST PRIVACY
I AM TOLD I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN TERRIBLY ALARMED AT THE STRAITS IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF A GIRL OF TWENTY ONE ALONE IN THE WORLD
PAUSING IN HER PAPERING WITH HER SLEEVES ROLLED UP THEY CALLED ME BROWNIE PARTLY BECAUSE OF MY DARK COMPLEXION BUT PARTLY BECAUSE THEY COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND ME WE ALL KNEW THAT LONG AGO
NOW DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT BE PRACTICAL ELSIE AND LET ME HELP YOU PAINT THE DADO
WHEN WE'VE FINISHED THE PAPERING I COULDN'T TEACH TEACHING LIKE MAUVE IS THE REFUGE OF THE INCOMPETENT AND I DON'T IF POSSIBLE WANT TO SELL BONNETS AS A MILLINER'S GIRL
FOR I WAS PROUD OF MY FATHER HA I REMEMBER HE DIED POOR FELLOW HE WAS A GOOD SOLDIER AND HIS' I FELT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY HIS FOOL OF A WIDOW BUT A GLANCE FROM ME QUELLED HER
I MUST HAVE SEEN YOU SOME YEARS AGO AT VIENNA MILADI
TO ALLOW OF ONE'S PLACING ANY VERY HIGH VALUE UPON IT BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT I MUST ADMIT I WAS NOT IN THE LEAST ALARMED NATURE HAD ENDOWED ME WITH A PROFUSION OF CRISP BLACK HAIR AND PLENTY OF HIGH SPIRITS
YES MADEMOISELLE
OF COURSE I HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION OF TAKING A LADY'S MAID'S PLACE FOR A PERMANENCY NOR EVEN IF IT COMES TO THAT AS A PASSING EXPEDIENT BUT IF I WANTED TO GO ROUND THE WORLD
OH I REMEMBER YOUR NAME WELL THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY BROKE IN I THINK YOU KNEW MY HUSBAND SIR EVELYN FAWLEY AND MY FATHER LORD KYNASTON THE COUNT LOOKED PROFOUNDLY SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED
A CROWD OF WITS POETS ARTISTS POLITICIANS PRESSING EAGERLY ROUND THE LANDAU THAT WAS MY MENTAL PICTURE AS I SAT AND CONFRONTED YOU I UNDERSTAND IT ALL NOW
OH THAT PLACID OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE EPISCOPAL GAITERS WAS THEIR FATHER WAS HE WELL A BISHOP SHOULD BRING UP HIS DAUGHTERS BETTER HAVING HIS CHILDREN IN SUBJECTION WITH ALL GRAVITY
I NATURALLY MADE UP MY MIND TO GO ROUND THE WORLD IT WAS MY STEPFATHER'S DEATH THAT DROVE ME TO IT I HAD NEVER SEEN MY STEPFATHER INDEED
I OWED HIM NOTHING EXCEPT MY POVERTY HE MARRIED MY DEAR MOTHER WHEN I WAS A GIRL AT SCHOOL IN SWITZERLAND AND HE PROCEEDED TO SPEND HER LITTLE FORTUNE LEFT AT HER SOLE DISPOSAL BY MY FATHER'S WILL IN PAYING HIS GAMBLING DEBTS
ARE INVARIABLY DISHONEST MORE DISHONEST THAN THE REST EVEN
THEY JUST GO TO THE PRIEST AND CONFESS YOU KNOW AND WIPE IT ALL OUT AND START FRESH AGAIN ON A CAREER OF CRIME NEXT MORNING I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW WHY I EVER GO ABROAD THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD FIT TO LIVE IN IS ENGLAND
WHAT YOU ARE THEN LADY GEORGINA FAWLEY HE CRIED STRIKING AN ATTITUDE INDEED MILADI YOUR ADMIRABLE HUSBAND WAS ONE OF THE VERY FIRST TO EXERT HIS INFLUENCE IN MY FAVOUR AT VIENNA
OR FIND SHE WAS AN ENGLISH GIRL WITHOUT ONE WORD OF GERMAN OR NURSE HER ON THE BOAT WHEN I WANT TO GIVE MY UNDIVIDED ATTENTION TO MY OWN MISFORTUNES NO AMELIA I CALL IT POSITIVELY UNKIND OF YOU TO SUGGEST SUCH A THING YOU'RE SO UNSYMPATHETIC
IT'S THE ONE TONGUE ON EARTH THAT EVEN A PRETTY GIRL'S LIPS FAIL TO RENDER ATTRACTIVE YOU YOURSELF MAKE FACES OVER IT WHAT'S YOUR NAME YOUNG WOMAN LOIS CAYLEY LOIS WHAT A NAME
CERTAINLY NOT MY CHILD I ANSWERED SHE WAS THREE YEARS OLDER THAN I SO I HAD THE RIGHT TO PATRONISE HER THAT WOULD SPOIL ALL YOUR DEAR LITTLE FACE WOULD BE QUITE ENOUGH TO SCARE AWAY A TIMID ADVENTURE
I FIND IT THE MOST FASCINATING CAPITAL IN EUROPE WHAT GAIETY WHAT MOVEMENT WHAT POETRY WHAT MYSTERY IF MYSTERY MEANS FOG IT CHALLENGES THE WORLD I INTERPOSED HE GAZED AT ME WITH FIXED EYES
BUT YOUR FACE HAD IMPRESSED ITSELF ON MY SUB CONSCIOUS SELF I DID NOT LEARN TILL LATER THAT THE ESOTERIC DOCTRINE OF THE SUB CONSCIOUS SELF WAS LADY GEORGINA'S FAVOURITE HOBBY THE MOMENT CHANCE LED ME TO THIS CARRIAGE THIS MORNING
NATURE DID NOT CUT ME OUT FOR A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I COULDN'T SWALLOW A POKER IF I TRIED FOR WEEKS POKERS DON'T AGREE WITH ME BETWEEN OURSELVES I AM A BIT OF A REBEL YOU ARE BROWNIE SHE ANSWERED
HE WAS A CHARMING MAN YOU READ HIS MASTERLY PAPER ON THE CENTRAL PROBLEM OF THE DUAL EMPIRE YOU WERE IN VIENNA THEN THE CANTANKEROUS OLD LADY MUSED BACK LOIS MY CHILD DON'T STARE'
OMNIBUSES TRAVERSE IT FROM END TO END EVEN I AM TOLD TO ISLINGTON AND PUTNEY WITHIN FOLK SIT FACE TO FACE WHO NEVER SAW ONE ANOTHER BEFORE IN THEIR LIVES AND WHO MAY NEVER SEE ONE ANOTHER AGAIN OR ON THE CONTRARY
AND THEN I WOULD LEAVE YOU SALARY IS UNIMPORTANT MY FARE SUFFICES I ACCEPT THE CHANCE AS A CHEAP OPPORTUNITY OF ATTAINING SCHLANGENBAD THE YELLOW FACED OLD LADY PUT UP HER LONG HANDLED TORTOISE SHELL EYEGLASSES
MAY PASS THE REST OF THEIR DAYS TOGETHER I HAD A LOVELY HARANGUE ALL PAT IN MY HEAD IN MUCH THE SAME STRAIN ON THE INFINITE POSSIBILITIES OF ENTERTAINING ANGELS UNAWARES IN CABS ON THE UNDERGROUND
AND INSPECTED ME ALL OVER AGAIN WELL I DECLARE SHE MURMURED WHAT ARE GIRLS COMING TO I WONDER GIRTON YOU SAY GIRTON THAT PLACE AT CAMBRIDGE YOU SPEAK GREEK OF COURSE BUT HOW ABOUT GERMAN
HOW COULD I DO BETTER THAN SET OUT BY THE RHINE COUNTRY THE RHINE LEADS YOU ON TO THE DANUBE THE DANUBE TO THE BLACK SEA THE BLACK SEA TO ASIA AND SO BY WAY OF INDIA CHINA AND JAPAN YOU REACH THE PACIFIC AND SAN FRANCISCO
BUT ELSIE'S WIDENING EYES OF HORROR PULLED ME UP SHORT LIKE A HANSOM IN PICCADILLY WHEN THE INEXORABLE UPTURNED HAND OF THE POLICEMAN CHECKS IT OH BROWNIE
SO WHEN THE COLONEL DIED IN THE YEAR I WAS LEAVING COLLEGE I DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO GO INTO MOURNING FOR HIM ESPECIALLY AS HE CHOSE THE PRECISE MOMENT WHEN MY ALLOWANCE WAS DUE
I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO ONE ELSIE PUT IN GRACIOUS HEAVENS NEITHER HAVE I WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU TAKE ME FOR BUT I MEAN TO SEE WHERE FATE WILL LEAD ME I MAY GO WITH YOU ELSIE PLEADED
A HUNDRED CROWNS YES SIR SO YOU SEE THAT I AM NOT LIKELY TO DO ANY OF THESE THINGS NOT EVEN FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WAGES COME IT IS WORTH THINKING ABOUT FOR FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS
THE MAN LOOKED AT THE BANK NOTES FELT THEM COUNTED THEM TURNED PALE THEN RED THEN RUSHED INTO HIS ROOM TO DRINK A GLASS OF WATER BUT HE HAD NO TIME TO REACH THE WATER JUG AND FAINTED IN THE MIDST OF HIS DRIED HERBS
THE GARDEN WAS CROSSED BY A PATH OF RED GRAVEL EDGED BY A BORDER OF THICK BOX OF MANY YEARS GROWTH AND OF A TONE AND COLOR THAT WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED THE HEART OF DELACROIX OUR MODERN RUBENS
BUT THAT MORNING LAID DOWN AND UPON WHICH THE WATER WAS YET GLISTENING FOR THE REST THE ORDERS HAD BEEN ISSUED BY THE COUNT HE HIMSELF HAD GIVEN A PLAN TO BERTUCCIO MARKING THE SPOT WHERE EACH TREE WAS TO BE PLANTED
STAY LOOK AT
LEFT ENRAPTURED SO GREAT SO POWERFUL AND REAL WAS THE INFLUENCE EXERCISED BY THIS MAN OVER ALL WHO SURROUNDED HIM AT PRECISELY SIX O'CLOCK THE CLATTER OF HORSES HOOFS WAS HEARD AT THE ENTRANCE DOOR
NOTHING MORE IS REQUIRED OF ME IS IT POSSIBLE SAID MONTE CRISTO TO HIMSELF THAT I CAN HAVE MET WITH A MAN THAT HAS NO AMBITION THAT WOULD SPOIL MY PLANS SIR SAID THE GARDENER
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE TO MATCH WITH THE LIBRARY WAS THE CONSERVATORY ORNAMENTED WITH RARE FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED IN CHINA JARS AND IN THE MIDST OF THE GREENHOUSE
CAVALCANTI THAT TELLS ME THEIR NAME AND NOTHING ELSE AH TRUE YOU DO NOT KNOW THE ITALIAN NOBILITY THE CAVALCANTI ARE ALL DESCENDED FROM PRINCES HAVE THEY ANY FORTUNE
AND IN WHICH MYRIADS OF SMALL FISH HAVE SLEPT SEEKING A REFUGE FROM THE PURSUIT OF THEIR ENEMIES MEANWHILE DANGLARS WHO HAD
OH OH HE AT LENGTH MUTTERED DO YOU SEE WHAT WHO HIM HIM
AND I OUGHT NOT TO WASTE IT BUT HAVING RECEIVED THE SIGNAL THAT I MIGHT REST FOR AN HOUR HERE HE GLANCED AT THE SUN DIAL FOR THERE WAS EVERYTHING IN THE ENCLOSURE OF MONTLHERY EVEN A SUN DIAL
ARE THEY GOING TO PUT HIM IN THE MINISTRY NOT YET I THINK MORE LIKELY HE HAS BEEN SPECULATING ON THE BOURSE AND HAS LOST MONEY
I THINK SO INDEED HE HAS SIX MILLIONS WORTH HE MUST SELL THEM AT WHATEVER PRICE WHY
COME CALM YOURSELF AND RECKON THEM UP
TAKE THESE AND THE COUNT PLACED THE PACKET IN THE MAN'S HANDS NOW THIS IS NOT ALL HE SAID YOU CANNOT LIVE UPON YOUR FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS I SHALL STILL HAVE MY PLACE NO
DORMICE ARE BAD NEIGHBORS FOR US WHO DO NOT EAT THEM PRESERVED AS THE ROMANS DID WHAT DID THE ROMANS EAT THEM SAID THE GARDENER ATE DORMICE
AND FASTENED THE STRING TO THE NAIL AND CAST A LOOK AROUND THE MAN AT THE TELEGRAPH SAID HE MUST EITHER ENGAGE A GARDENER OR DEVOTE HIMSELF PASSIONATELY TO AGRICULTURE
LISTEN FRIEND SAID MONTE CRISTO I DO NOT WISH TO CAUSE YOU ANY REMORSE BELIEVE ME THEN WHEN I SWEAR TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE WRONGED NO MAN BUT ON THE CONTRARY HAVE BENEFITED MANKIND
BUT A TRAVELLER BROUGHT HERE BY A CURIOSITY HE HALF REPENTS OF SINCE HE CAUSES YOU TO LOSE YOUR TIME AH MY TIME IS NOT VALUABLE REPLIED THE MAN WITH A MELANCHOLY SMILE
HE SAID WILL YOUR EXCELLENCY DEIGN TO OPEN IT SAID THE DELIGHTED BERTUCCIO AND YOU WILL FIND GLOVES IN IT ELSEWHERE THE COUNT FOUND EVERYTHING HE REQUIRED SMELLING BOTTLES CIGARS KNICK KNACKS GOOD HE SAID
JUST SO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS DO YOU UNDERSTAND SIR LET ME SEE MY RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT ON THE CONTRARY DO NOT LOOK AT HIM BUT AT THIS WHAT IS IT WHAT
AT FIRST MY NECK WAS CRAMPED WITH LOOKING AT IT BUT AT THE END OF A YEAR I BECAME USED TO IT
BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI THAT TENDER FATHER WITH WHOM WE ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED CLOSE TO HIM DRESSED IN ENTIRELY NEW CLOTHES ADVANCED SMILINGLY COUNT ANDREA CAVALCANTI THE DUTIFUL SON
OR RATHER THERE IS NO TRUTH IN ANYTHING YOU HAVE TOLD ME IT WAS A FRIGHT OF THE IMAGINATION A DREAM OF YOUR FANCY YOU WENT TO SLEEP FULL OF THOUGHTS OF VENGEANCE THEY WEIGHED HEAVILY UPON YOUR STOMACH YOU HAD THE NIGHTMARE
WHOM WE ALSO KNOW THE THREE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE TALKING TOGETHER ON THE ENTRANCE OF THE NEW COMERS THEIR EYES GLANCED FROM FATHER TO SON AND THEN NATURALLY ENOUGH RESTED ON THE LATTER WHOM THEY BEGAN CRITICISING
AS TO THE LEFT HAND ONE HE CONSCIENTIOUSLY REPEATED THE SAME SIGNALS WHICH WERE FINALLY TRANSMITTED TO THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR NOW YOU ARE RICH SAID MONTE CRISTO YES REPLIED THE MAN
BY THE OLD TOWER COVERED WITH IVY AND STUDDED WITH WALL FLOWERS NO ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IN LOOKING AT THIS OLD WEATHER BEATEN FLORAL DECKED TOWER WHICH MIGHT BE LIKENED TO AN ELDERLY DAME DRESSED UP TO RECEIVE HER GRANDCHILDREN
I HAVE TEN LEFT SAID THE MAN FOR HERE ARE ELEVEN AND I HAD TWENTY ONE FIVE MORE THAN LAST YEAR BUT I AM NOT SURPRISED THE SPRING HAS BEEN WARM THIS YEAR AND STRAWBERRIES REQUIRE HEAT SIR
FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE NEW TELEGRAM REACHED THE MINISTER DEBRAY
UNTIL HE ENTERED HIS BEDROOM SITUATED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE TO THE CLOSED ROOM THEN HE APPROACHED A LITTLE PIECE OF FURNITURE MADE OF ROSEWOOD WHICH HE HAD NOTICED AT A PREVIOUS VISIT THAT CAN ONLY BE TO HOLD GLOVES
GRAY MOUSTACHES A BOLD EYE A MAJOR'S UNIFORM ORNAMENTED WITH THREE MEDALS AND FIVE CROSSES IN FACT THE THOROUGH BEARING OF AN OLD SOLDIER SUCH WAS THE APPEARANCE OF MAJOR
A PAUL POTTER
YOU LIVE BADLY ON YOUR THOUSAND FRANCS BADLY ENOUGH BUT YET I DO LIVE YES BUT YOU HAVE A WRETCHEDLY SMALL GARDEN TRUE THE GARDEN IS NOT LARGE
GAVE NO INDICATIONS OF SPLENDOR NOTHING ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM THE DESTINED RESIDENCE OF THE MAGNIFICENT COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO BUT THIS SIMPLICITY WAS ACCORDING TO THE WILL OF ITS MASTER
HOW A GARDENER MAY GET RID OF THE DORMICE THAT EAT HIS PEACHES NOT ON THE SAME NIGHT AS HE HAD INTENDED BUT THE NEXT MORNING THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO WENT OUT BY THE BARRIER D'ENFER
AT A BIRTHDAY FEAST THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF TELLING STRANGE THINGS IF IN ADDITION TO THE MENACING EARS WHICH THE PROVERB SAYS ALL WALLS ARE PROVIDED WITH IT HAD ALSO A VOICE
MAKE FIFTEEN YOU ARE FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD HOW LONG MUST YOU HAVE SERVED TO CLAIM THE PENSION OH SIR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND HOW MUCH IS THE PENSION A HUNDRED CROWNS
DO YOU NOT KNOW THESE BITS OF PAPER BANK NOTES EXACTLY THERE ARE FIFTEEN OF THEM AND WHOSE ARE THEY YOURS IF YOU LIKE MINE EXCLAIMED THE MAN
THE OTHER TEN WERE SUNK THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS DEEP INTO THE SEA THE SEA KNOWING WHAT WAS REQUIRED OF HER THREW OVER THEM HER WEEDS
IN A THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR A GARDEN WITH TWO ACRES OF LAND AND A THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR OH HEAVENS COME TAKE THEM AND MONTE CRISTO FORCED THE BANK NOTES INTO HIS HAND WHAT AM I TO DO
AND THE PENINSULA IS IN THE ENJOYMENT OF PROFOUND PEACE A TELEGRAPHIC SIGNAL IMPROPERLY INTERPRETED
STAY SAID DEBRAY I RECOGNIZE THIS HOBBEMA AH INDEED YES IT WAS PROPOSED FOR THE MUSEUM WHICH I BELIEVE DOES NOT CONTAIN ONE SAID MONTE CRISTO
AT THE SAME TIME TELLS MY RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT THAT I AM READY WHILE IT GIVES NOTICE TO MY LEFT HAND CORRESPONDENT TO PREPARE IN HIS TURN IT IS VERY INGENIOUS SAID THE COUNT
THOUGH THEY DO SAY AS FAT AS A DORMOUSE IT IS NOT A WONDER THEY ARE FAT SLEEPING ALL DAY AND ONLY WAKING TO EAT ALL NIGHT LISTEN LAST YEAR I HAD FOUR APRICOTS THEY STOLE ONE
PRICKED HIM DREADFULLY HE SHUDDERED AND RUBBED HIS EYES AS THOUGH AWAKING FROM A DREAM SIR SAID MONTE CRISTO TO HIM I DO NOT RECOMMEND MY PICTURES TO YOU WHO POSSESS SUCH SPLENDID PAINTINGS BUT NEVERTHELESS
SAID MORREL BESTOWING A GRATEFUL SMILE ON MONTE CRISTO IT SEEMS TO ME SAID DANGLARS IN HIS COARSE TONE ILL CONCEALED BY A FORCED SMILE THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY GOT HORSES ENOUGH
NOTHING ESCAPED THE COUNT'S NOTICE AND HE OBSERVED A LITTLE NOTE PASSED WITH THE FACILITY THAT INDICATES FREQUENT PRACTICE FROM THE HAND OF MADAME DANGLARS TO THAT OF THE MINISTER'S SECRETARY AFTER HIS WIFE THE BANKER DESCENDED
EXCUSE ME SIR REPLIED THE MAN RAISING HIS HAND TO HIS CAP I AM NOT UP THERE I KNOW BUT I HAVE ONLY JUST COME DOWN DO NOT LET ME INTERFERE WITH YOU IN ANYTHING MY FRIEND SAID THE COUNT GATHER YOUR STRAWBERRIES IF INDEED
NOTWITHSTANDING HIS SELF CONTROL WAS VISIBLY AFFECTED AND WHEN MONTE CRISTO TOUCHED HIS HAND HE FELT IT TREMBLE CERTAINLY WOMEN ALONE KNOW HOW TO DISSIMULATE SAID MONTE CRISTO TO HIMSELF GLANCING AT MADAME DANGLARS
THERE WAS NOT A BLADE OF GRASS TO BE SEEN IN THE PATHS
MONTE CRISTO HAD SEEN ENOUGH EVERY MAN HAS A DEVOURING PASSION IN HIS HEART AS EVERY FRUIT HAS ITS WORM THAT OF THE TELEGRAPH MAN WAS HORTICULTURE HE BEGAN GATHERING THE GRAPE LEAVES WHICH SCREENED THE SUN FROM THE GRAPES
SUCH A QUESTION IT IS THE WORK OF ANOTHER AGE CONSTRUCTED BY THE GENII OF EARTH AND WATER HOW SO AT WHAT PERIOD CAN THAT HAVE BEEN I DO NOT KNOW
WITH CORAL AND ENCRUSTED THEM WITH SHELLS THE WHOLE WAS CEMENTED BY TWO HUNDRED YEARS BENEATH THESE ALMOST IMPERVIOUS DEPTHS FOR A REVOLUTION CARRIED AWAY THE EMPEROR WHO WISHED TO MAKE THE TRIAL
WAS SCENTED WITH ITS MASTER'S FAVORITE PERFUMES AND HAD THE VERY LIGHT REGULATED ACCORDING TO HIS WISH WHEN THE COUNT ARRIVED HE HAD UNDER HIS TOUCH HIS BOOKS AND ARMS HIS EYES RESTED UPON HIS FAVORITE PICTURES
AND FASTENED WITH A NAIL AND STRING THE COUNT SOON MASTERED THE MECHANISM THE GATE OPENED AND HE THEN FOUND HIMSELF IN A LITTLE GARDEN ABOUT TWENTY FEET LONG BY TWELVE WIDE BOUNDED ON ONE SIDE BY PART OF THE HEDGE
THE OVERSEER WOULD NOT HAVE OBJECTED WHILE HE WAS ABOUT IT TO HAVE MADE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDEN BUT THE COUNT HAD POSITIVELY FORBIDDEN IT TO BE TOUCHED BERTUCCIO MADE AMENDS HOWEVER
YOU ARE FOND OF GARDENING PASSIONATELY AND YOU WOULD BE PLEASED TO HAVE INSTEAD OF THIS TERRACE OF TWENTY FEET AN ENCLOSURE OF TWO ACRES SIR I SHOULD MAKE A TERRESTRIAL PARADISE OF IT
STEALING IN A GARDEN HE DOES NOT KNOW WHERE THAT MAY LEAD HIM TO CERTAINLY IT IS WRONG SAID MONTE CRISTO BUT YOU SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE YOUTH AND GREEDINESS OF THE DELINQUENT OF COURSE SAID THE GARDENER
IF YOU HAD SEEN AT WHAT A PACE HE CAME LIKE THE WIND I SHOULD THINK SO A HORSE THAT COST FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS SAID MONTE CRISTO IN THE TONE WHICH A FATHER WOULD USE TOWARDS A SON
THIS PATH WAS FORMED IN THE SHAPE OF THE FIGURE OF EIGHT THUS IN ITS WINDINGS MAKING A WALK OF SIXTY FEET IN A GARDEN OF ONLY TWENTY NEVER HAD FLORA THE FRESH AND SMILING GODDESS OF GARDENERS
CAVALCANTI SAID DEBRAY A FINE NAME SAID MORREL YES SAID CHATEAU RENAUD THESE ITALIANS ARE WELL NAMED AND BADLY DRESSED YOU ARE FASTIDIOUS CHATEAU RENAUD REPLIED DEBRAY
THE MAN EXECUTED ONE AFTER THE OTHER THE THREE SIGNS GIVEN BY THE COUNT IN SPITE OF THE FRIGHTFUL CONTORTIONS OF THE RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT WHO NOT UNDERSTANDING THE CHANGE BEGAN TO THINK THE GARDENER HAD GONE MAD
TAKING THE ROAD TO ORLEANS LEAVING THE VILLAGE OF LINAS WITHOUT STOPPING AT THE TELEGRAPH WHICH FLOURISHED ITS GREAT BONY ARMS AS HE PASSED THE COUNT REACHED THE TOWER OF MONTLHERY
I THINK I CAN EFFECTUALLY FORCE YOU AND MONTE CRISTO DREW ANOTHER PACKET FROM HIS POCKET HERE ARE TEN THOUSAND MORE FRANCS HE SAID WITH THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND ALREADY IN YOUR POCKET THEY WILL MAKE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND
WITH FIVE THOUSAND YOU CAN BUY A PRETTY LITTLE HOUSE WITH TWO ACRES OF LAND
YES SIR YOU ALARM ME NONSENSE SIR
PRESERVING THE SEEDS HE HAD LABELLED THEM WITH AS MUCH CARE AS IF HE HAD BEEN MASTER BOTANIST
AND THE SHAPE AND EXTENT OF THE LAWN WHICH WAS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE PAVING STONES THUS THE HOUSE HAD BECOME UNRECOGNIZABLE AND BERTUCCIO HIMSELF DECLARED THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW IT ENCIRCLED AS IT WAS BY A FRAMEWORK OF TREES
AND WON THE HEART OF THE GARDENER DID YOU COME HERE SIR TO SEE THE TELEGRAPH HE SAID YES IF IT ISN'T CONTRARY TO THE RULES OH NO SAID THE GARDENER NOT IN THE LEAST
GLIDING DOWN THE STAIRS RESTORED BUT THE PREVIOUS DAY AS IF THEY HAD ALWAYS INHABITED THE HOUSE OTHERS FILLING THE COACH HOUSES WHERE THE EQUIPAGES ENCASED AND NUMBERED APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN INSTALLED FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS
NO AND YET THEY REFUSED TO BUY IT WHY SAID CHATEAU RENAUD YOU PRETEND NOT TO KNOW
DO YOU REGRET THEM ASKED MORREL WITH HIS OPEN LAUGH I CERTAINLY NOT REPLIED THE COUNT NO I SHOULD ONLY REGRET IF THE HORSE HAD NOT PROVED GOOD IT IS SO GOOD
WILL YOU CONDUCT THE BARONESS DANGLARS
A HUNDRED FRANCS THE TENTH OF YOUR INCOME THAT WOULD BE FINE WORK AH SAID THE MAN HAS IT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU SAID MONTE CRISTO ONCE SIR WHEN I WAS GRAFTING A ROSE TREE
BY LOADING THE ANTE CHAMBERS STAIRCASES AND MANTLE PIECES WITH FLOWERS WHAT ABOVE ALL MANIFESTED THE SHREWDNESS OF THE STEWARD AND THE PROFOUND SCIENCE OF THE MASTER THE ONE IN CARRYING OUT THE IDEAS OF THE OTHER
AT THE END OF TWO HUNDRED YEARS THE DOCUMENTS WERE FOUND AND THEY THOUGHT OF BRINGING UP THE JARS DIVERS DESCENDED IN MACHINES MADE EXPRESSLY ON THE DISCOVERY INTO THE BAY WHERE THEY WERE THROWN
AND HE GLANCED TIMIDLY AT THE COUNT'S BLUE COAT CALM YOURSELF MY FRIEND SAID THE COUNT WITH THE SMILE WHICH HE MADE AT WILL EITHER TERRIBLE OR BENEVOLENT AND WHICH NOW EXPRESSED ONLY THE KINDLIEST FEELING I AM NOT AN INSPECTOR
THE TOWER CONTAINED IMPLEMENTS SUCH AS SPADES RAKES WATERING POTS HUNG AGAINST THE WALL THIS WAS ALL THE FURNITURE THE SECOND WAS THE MAN'S CONVENTIONAL ABODE OR RATHER SLEEPING PLACE
THE COUNT WATCHED HIM GOOD HEAVENS HE EXCLAIMED WHAT IS THE MATTER SAID THE COUNT THAT WOMAN THAT WOMAN WHICH THE ONE WITH A WHITE DRESS AND SO MANY DIAMONDS THE FAIR ONE MADAME DANGLARS
AND AT THE SAME MINUTE A CARRIAGE WITH SMOKING HORSES ACCOMPANIED BY TWO MOUNTED GENTLEMEN ARRIVED AT THE GATE WHICH OPENED BEFORE THEM THE CARRIAGE DROVE ROUND AND STOPPED AT THE STEPS FOLLOWED BY THE HORSEMEN
WHICH HE WAS PLACING UPON GRAPE LEAVES HE HAD TWELVE LEAVES AND ABOUT AS MANY STRAWBERRIES WHICH ON RISING SUDDENLY HE LET FALL FROM HIS HAND YOU ARE GATHERING YOUR CROP SIR SAID MONTE CRISTO SMILING
THIS IS THE REASON THAT INSTEAD OF THE SIXTEEN I HAD LAST YEAR I HAVE THIS YEAR YOU SEE ELEVEN ALREADY PLUCKED TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AH I MISS THREE
MONTE CRISTO LOOKED IN TURN AT THE TWO IRON HANDLES BY WHICH THE MACHINE WAS WORKED IT IS VERY INTERESTING HE SAID BUT IT MUST BE VERY TEDIOUS FOR A LIFETIME YES
SAID THE COUNT SEVERELY I ORDERED DINNER AT THAT HOUR AND I DO NOT LIKE TO WAIT AND HE RETURNED TO HIS GUESTS WHILE BERTUCCIO LEANING AGAINST THE WALL SUCCEEDED IN REACHING THE DINING ROOM
I SHOULD NOT SEE HIM THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN I COULD NOT REPEAT THE SIGNALS AND THEN NOT HAVING REPEATED THEM THROUGH NEGLIGENCE I SHOULD BE FINED HOW MUCH
IT WAS OUR CAPTAIN OF SPAHIS WHO HAD ARRIVED ON MEDEAH I AM SURE I AM THE FIRST CRIED MORREL I DID IT ON PURPOSE TO HAVE YOU A MINUTE TO MYSELF BEFORE EVERY ONE CAME JULIE AND EMMANUEL
MARVELLOUS ALIKE TO SIGHT AND SMELL WAS A BILLIARD TABLE WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN ABANDONED DURING THE PAST HOUR BY PLAYERS WHO HAD LEFT THE BALLS ON THE CLOTH ONE CHAMBER ALONE HAD BEEN RESPECTED BY THE MAGNIFICENT BERTUCCIO
AND ORDERED HIM TO SELL AT ANY PRICE WHEN IT WAS SEEN THAT DANGLARS SOLD THE SPANISH FUNDS FELL DIRECTLY DANGLARS LOST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS BUT HE RID HIMSELF OF ALL HIS SPANISH SHARES
UPON WHICH GREEN FRUIT HAD SUCCEEDED TO RED AND WHITE FLOWERS MONTE CRISTO LOOKED FOR THE ENTRANCE TO THE ENCLOSURE AND WAS NOT LONG IN FINDING A LITTLE WOODEN GATE WORKING ON WILLOW HINGES
WITH HIS EYES STARTING AND HIS HAIR ON END WAITING FOR WHOM BERTUCCIO WITHOUT ANSWERING
BUT PEOPLE WOULD SAY HE WAS AFRAID AND A BRAVE CAPTAIN OF SPAHIS CANNOT RISK THIS EVEN TO GRATIFY A PRETTY WOMAN WHICH IS IN MY OPINION ONE OF THE MOST SACRED OBLIGATIONS IN THE WORLD YOU SEE MY POSITION MADAME
LIVED SANG AND BLOOMED LIKE THE HOUSES WE HAVE LONG CHERISHED AND IN WHICH WHEN WE ARE FORCED TO LEAVE THEM WE LEAVE A PART OF OUR SOULS THE SERVANTS PASSED GAYLY ALONG THE FINE COURT YARD SOME BELONGING TO THE KITCHENS
THOUSAND FRANCS SIR IT IS NOTHING NO BUT THEN WE ARE LODGED AS YOU PERCEIVE MONTE CRISTO LOOKED AT THE ROOM THEY PASSED TO THE THIRD STORY IT WAS THE TELEGRAPH ROOM
AND HAVING TEN MINUTES BEFORE ME AND MY STRAWBERRIES BEING RIPE WHEN A DAY LONGER BY THE BY SIR DO YOU THINK DORMICE EAT THEM INDEED I SHOULD THINK NOT REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
AND ACROSS THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE THEN REPRESSING A SLIGHT EMOTION WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN SEEN ON HER COUNTENANCE IF SHE HAD NOT KEPT HER COLOR SHE ASCENDED THE STEPS SAYING TO MORREL SIR
SEVEN MAJOR BARTOLOMEO CAVALCANTI EIGHT EIGHT REPEATED BERTUCCIO STOP YOU ARE IN A SHOCKING HURRY TO BE OFF YOU FORGET ONE OF MY GUESTS LEAN A LITTLE TO THE LEFT
FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS THE DOORS OF THE DRAWING ROOM WERE THROWN OPEN AND BERTUCCIO APPEARING SAID WITH A VIOLENT EFFORT
A RAPHAEL A VANDYKE A ZURBARAN
WAS THAT THIS HOUSE WHICH APPEARED ONLY THE NIGHT BEFORE SO SAD AND GLOOMY IMPREGNATED WITH THAT SICKLY SMELL ONE CAN ALMOST FANCY TO BE THE SMELL OF TIME HAD IN A SINGLE DAY ACQUIRED THE ASPECT OF LIFE
BUT OF TEN THREE ONLY REMAINED THE REST HAVING BEEN BROKEN BY THE WAVES I AM FOND OF THESE JARS UPON WHICH PERHAPS MISSHAPEN FRIGHTFUL MONSTERS HAVE FIXED THEIR COLD DULL EYES
I WILL INTRODUCE YOU TO THEM BUT THEY APPEAR TO SPEAK FRENCH WITH A VERY PURE ACCENT SAID DANGLARS THE SON HAS BEEN EDUCATED IN A COLLEGE IN THE SOUTH I BELIEVE NEAR MARSEILLES YOU WILL FIND HIM QUITE ENTHUSIASTIC
AND OUR HOLIDAYS HOLIDAYS YES WHEN WHEN WE HAVE A FOG
AND EMBRACING HIS WIFE AFTER A SHORT TIME THE COUNT SAW BERTUCCIO WHO UNTIL THEN HAD BEEN OCCUPIED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE GLIDE INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM HE WENT TO HIM
NOT ONE BORE THE MARK OF THE SLUG NOR WERE THERE EVIDENCES ANYWHERE OF THE CLUSTERING APHIS WHICH IS SO DESTRUCTIVE TO PLANTS GROWING IN A DAMP SOIL AND YET IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THE DAMP HAD BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE GARDEN THE EARTH
WHAT DID YOU SAY SIR ASKED THE MAN I WAS SAYING IT WAS VERY INTERESTING WHAT WAS ALL YOU WERE SHOWING ME AND YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND NONE OF THESE SIGNALS NONE AT ALL
AND THEN SUCH AS IT IS IT IS FILLED WITH DORMICE WHO EAT EVERYTHING AH THEY ARE MY SCOURGES TELL ME SHOULD YOU HAVE THE MISFORTUNE TO TURN YOUR HEAD
NOTHING VERY DIFFICULT BUT WHAT IS IT TO REPEAT THESE SIGNS MONTE CRISTO TOOK A PAPER FROM HIS POCKET UPON WHICH WERE DRAWN THREE SIGNS WITH NUMBERS TO INDICATE THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE TO BE WORKED
AS PALE AS THOUGH HE HAD ISSUED FROM HIS TOMB INSTEAD OF HIS CARRIAGE MADAME DANGLARS THREW A RAPID AND INQUIRING GLANCE WHICH COULD ONLY BE INTERPRETED BY MONTE CRISTO AROUND THE COURT YARD OVER THE PERISTYLE
THAT IS TRUE SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I LIKE BEST SAID THE MAN SMILING WHY DO YOU LIKE THAT BEST BECAUSE THEN I HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY I AM A MACHINE THEN AND NOTHING ELSE AND SO LONG AS I WORK
BLACK AS SOOT THE THICK FOLIAGE OF THE TREES BETRAYED ITS PRESENCE BESIDES HAD NATURAL HUMIDITY BEEN WANTING IT COULD HAVE BEEN IMMEDIATELY SUPPLIED BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS THANKS TO A TANK OF WATER
WELL SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO ALTER A SIGNAL AND SUBSTITUTE ANOTHER AH THAT IS ANOTHER CASE I SHOULD BE TURNED OFF AND LOSE MY PENSION THREE HUNDRED FRANCS
GLANCING AT THE SUN DIAL THE TEN MINUTES ARE ALMOST UP I MUST RETURN TO MY POST WILL YOU GO UP WITH ME I FOLLOW YOU MONTE CRISTO ENTERED THE TOWER WHICH WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE STORIES
YOU WILL LOSE IT FOR YOU ARE GOING TO ALTER YOUR CORRESPONDENT'S MESSAGE OH SIR WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING A JEST SIR UNLESS YOU FORCE ME
I SHOULD ASK YOU IF YOU WOULD SELL YOUR HORSE MORREL SMILED WITH AN EXPRESSION VERY LIKE A GRIMACE AND THEN TURNED ROUND TO MONTE CRISTO
AND OFT TIS WONT IN SUMMER TO BE SICKLY PASSING THAT WAY THE VIRGIN PITILESS LAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FEN DESCRIED UNTILLED AND NAKED OF INHABITANTS THERE TO ESCAPE ALL HUMAN INTERCOURSE SHE WITH HER SERVANTS STAYED HER ARTS TO PRACTISE AND LIVED
AND THE GOOD MASTER YET FROM OFF HIS HAUNCH DEPOSED ME NOT TILL TO THE HOLE HE BROUGHT ME OF HIM WHO SO LAMENTED WITH HIS SHANKS WHOE'ER THOU ART THAT STANDEST UPSIDE DOWN O DOLEFUL SOUL IMPLANTED LIKE A STAKE TO SAY BEGAN I
BUT AS I SHOULD HAVE BURNED AND BAKED MYSELF MY TERROR OVERMASTERED MY GOOD WILL WHICH MADE ME GREEDY OF EMBRACING THEM THEN I BEGAN SORROW AND NOT DISDAIN DID YOUR CONDITION FIX WITHIN ME SO THAT TARDILY IT WHOLLY IS STRIPPED OFF
EVEN SUCH BECAME I AT THOSE PROFFERED WORDS BUT SHAME IN ME HIS MENACES PRODUCED WHICH MAKETH SERVANT STRONG BEFORE GOOD MASTER I SEATED ME UPON THOSE MONSTROUS SHOULDERS I WISHED TO SAY AND YET THE VOICE CAME NOT AS I BELIEVED
THEN SAID TO ME THE MASTER SO THAT FULL EXPERIENCE OF THIS ROUND THOU BEAR AWAY NOW GO AND SEE WHAT THEIR CONDITION IS THERE LET THY CONVERSATION BE CONCISE TILL THOU RETURNEST I WILL SPEAK WITH HIM THAT HE CONCEDE TO US HIS STALWART SHOULDERS
I DO NOT KNOW IF I WERE HERE TOO BOLD THAT HIM I ANSWERED ONLY IN THIS METRE I PRAY THEE TELL ME NOW HOW GREAT A TREASURE OUR LORD DEMANDED OF SAINT PETER FIRST BEFORE HE PUT THE KEYS INTO HIS KEEPING TRULY HE NOTHING ASKED BUT FOLLOW ME
COMING AT THE PACE WHICH IN THIS WORLD THE LITANIES ASSUME AS LOWER DOWN MY SIGHT DESCENDED ON THEM WONDROUSLY EACH ONE SEEMED TO BE DISTORTED FROM CHIN TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CHEST FOR TOW'RDS THE REINS THE COUNTENANCE WAS TURNED
FOR ALL UPON ONE SIDE TOWARDS THE CASTLE THEIR FACES HAVE AND GO UNTO SAINT PETER'S ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY GO TOWARDS THE MOUNTAIN THIS SIDE AND THAT ALONG THE LIVID STONE BEHELD I HORNED DEMONS WITH GREAT SCOURGES
IF THOU CANST SPEAK OUT I STOOD EVEN AS THE FRIAR WHO IS CONFESSING THE FALSE ASSASSIN WHO WHEN HE IS FIXED RECALLS HIM SO THAT DEATH MAY BE DELAYED AND HE CRIED OUT DOST THOU STAND THERE ALREADY
AND THOU'RT ALESSIO INTERMINEI OF LUCCA THEREFORE I EYE THEE MORE THAN ALL THE OTHERS AND HE THEREON BELABOURING HIS PUMPKIN THE FLATTERIES HAVE SUBMERGED ME HERE BELOW WHEREWITH MY TONGUE WAS NEVER SURFEITED
BE THIS A SEAL ALL MEN TO UNDECEIVE OUT OF THE MOUTH OF EACH ONE THERE PROTRUDED THE FEET OF A TRANSGRESSOR AND THE LEGS UP TO THE CALF THE REST WITHIN REMAINED IN ALL OF THEM THE SOLES WERE BOTH ON FIRE WHEREFORE THE JOINTS SO VIOLENTLY QUIVERED
WHEN TO SEVER THE FIRST CABLE ERYPHYLUS HIS NAME WAS AND SO SINGS MY LOFTY TRAGEDY IN SOME PART OR OTHER THAT KNOWEST THOU WELL WHO KNOWEST THE WHOLE OF IT THE NEXT WHO IS SO SLENDER IN THE FLANKS WAS MICHAEL SCOTT
LOWERING HIS FACE BUT LITTLE IT AVAILED HIM FOR SAID I THOU THAT CASTEST DOWN THINE EYES IF FALSE ARE NOT THE FEATURES WHICH THOU BEAREST THOU ART VENEDICO CACCIANIMICO BUT WHAT DOTH BRING THEE TO SUCH PUNGENT SAUCES AND HE TO ME
WISDOM SUPREME O HOW GREAT ART THOU SHOWEST IN HEAVEN IN EARTH AND IN THE EVIL WORLD AND WITH WHAT JUSTICE DOTH THY POWER DISTRIBUTE I SAW UPON THE SIDES AND ON THE BOTTOM THE LIVID STONE WITH PERFORATIONS FILLED
AND TRULY WAS I SON OF THE SHE BEAR SO EAGER TO ADVANCE THE CUBS THAT WEALTH ABOVE AND HERE MYSELF I POCKETED BENEATH MY HEAD THE OTHERS ARE DRAGGED DOWN WHO HAVE PRECEDED ME IN SIMONY FLATTENED ALONG THE FISSURE OF THE ROCK
AS TO LOOK FORWARD HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM PERCHANCE INDEED BY VIOLENCE OF PALSY SOME ONE HAS BEEN THUS WHOLLY TURNED AWRY BUT I NE'ER SAW IT NOR BELIEVE IT CAN BE AS GOD MAY LET THEE READER GATHER FRUIT FROM THIS THY READING
AND I MY MASTER THY DISCOURSES ARE TO ME SO CERTAIN AND SO TAKE MY FAITH THAT UNTO ME THE REST WOULD BE SPENT COALS BUT TELL ME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PASSING IF ANY ONE NOTE WORTHY THOU BEHOLDEST FOR ONLY UNTO THAT MY MIND REVERTS
A MAN SHOULD CLOSE HIS LIPS AS FAR AS MAY BE BECAUSE WITHOUT HIS FAULT IT CAUSES SHAME BUT HERE I CANNOT AND READER BY THE NOTES OF THIS MY COMEDY TO THEE I SWEAR SO MAY THEY NOT BE VOID OF LASTING FAVOUR ATHWART THAT DENSE AND DARKSOME ATMOSPHERE
BY A THOUSAND SPRINGS I THINK AND MORE IS BATHED TWIXT GARDA AND VAL CAMONICA PENNINO WITH WATER THAT GROWS STAGNANT IN THAT LAKE MIDWAY A PLACE IS WHERE THE TRENTINE PASTOR AND HE OF BRESCIA
NOT THE SOLE BOLOGNESE AM I WHO WEEPS HERE NAY RATHER IS THIS PLACE SO FULL OF THEM THAT NOT SO MANY TONGUES TO DAY ARE TAUGHT TWIXT RENO AND SAVENA TO SAY SIPA AND IF THEREOF THOU WISHEST PLEDGE OR PROOF BRING TO THY MIND OUR AVARICIOUS HEART
AND AS ABOUT SUCH STRONGHOLDS FROM THEIR GATES UNTO THE OUTER BANK ARE LITTLE BRIDGES SO FROM THE PRECIPICE'S BASE DID CRAGS PROJECT WHICH INTERSECTED DIKES AND MOATS UNTO THE WELL THAT TRUNCATES AND COLLECTS THEM
THUS SPEAKING AT THY WILL THEREFORE IF THOU ESCAPE FROM THESE DARK PLACES AND COME TO REBEHOLD THE BEAUTEOUS STARS WHEN IT SHALL PLEASURE THEE TO SAY I WAS SEE THAT THOU SPEAK OF US UNTO THE PEOPLE
THEN SAID TO ME THE GUIDE SEE THAT THOU THRUST THY VISAGE SOMEWHAT FARTHER IN ADVANCE THAT WITH THINE EYES THOU WELL THE FACE ATTAIN OF THAT UNCLEANLY AND DISHEVELLED DRAB WHO THERE DOTH SCRATCH HERSELF WITH FILTHY NAILS AND CROUCHES NOW AND NOW ON FOOT IS STANDING
AND THE CITY OF BACCHUS HAD BECOME ENSLAVED SHE A LONG SEASON WANDERED THROUGH THE WORLD ABOVE IN BEAUTEOUS ITALY LIES A LAKE AT THE ALP'S FOOT THAT SHUTS IN GERMANY OVER TYROL AND HAS THE NAME BENACO
AND SO MAY THY RENOWN SHINE AFTER THEE VALOUR AND COURTESY SAY IF THEY DWELL WITHIN OUR CITY AS THEY USED TO DO OR IF THEY WHOLLY HAVE GONE OUT OF IT FOR GUGLIELMO BORSIER WHO IS IN TORMENT
WHO CRUELLY WERE BEATING THEM BEHIND AH ME HOW THEY DID MAKE THEM LIFT THEIR LEGS AT THE FIRST BLOWS AND SOOTH NOT ANY ONE THE SECOND WAITED FOR NOR FOR THE THIRD WHILE I WAS GOING ON MINE EYES BY ONE ENCOUNTERED WERE AND STRAIGHT I SAID
THAT ARUNS IS WHO BACKS THE OTHER'S BELLY WHO IN THE HILLS OF LUNI
TAKE HEED THAT THOU EMBRACE ME BUT HE WHO OTHER TIMES HAD RESCUED ME IN OTHER PERIL SOON AS I HAD MOUNTED WITHIN HIS ARMS ENCIRCLED AND SUSTAINED ME
HE SAID TO ME SOON THERE WILL UPWARD COME WHAT I AWAIT AND WHAT THY THOUGHT IS DREAMING MUST SOON REVEAL ITSELF UNTO THY SIGHT
AND YE A HUNDRED WORSHIP AH CONSTANTINE OF HOW MUCH ILL WAS MOTHER NOT THY CONVERSION BUT THAT MARRIAGE DOWER WHICH THE FIRST WEALTHY FATHER TOOK FROM THEE AND WHILE I SANG TO HIM SUCH NOTES AS THESE
AND LEFT HER EMPTY BODY THERE THE MEN THEREAFTER WHO WERE SCATTERED ROUND COLLECTED IN THAT PLACE WHICH WAS MADE STRONG BY THE LAGOON IT HAD ON EVERY SIDE THEY BUILT THEIR CITY OVER THOSE DEAD BONES AND AFTER HER WHO FIRST THE PLACE SELECTED MANTUA NAMED IT
NOR WHEN THE WRETCHED ICARUS HIS FLANKS FELT STRIPPED OF FEATHERS BY THE MELTING WAX
I FOUND MY GUIDE WHO HAD ALREADY MOUNTED UPON THE BACK OF THAT WILD ANIMAL AND SAID TO ME NOW BE BOTH STRONG AND BOLD NOW WE DESCEND BY STAIRWAYS SUCH AS THESE MOUNT THOU IN FRONT FOR I WILL BE MIDWAY SO THAT THE TAIL MAY HAVE NO POWER TO HARM THEE
THEREFORE WITH BOTH HIS ARMS HE TOOK ME UP AND WHEN HE HAD ME ALL UPON HIS BREAST REMOUNTED BY THE WAY WHERE HE DESCENDED NOR DID HE TIRE TO HAVE ME CLASPED TO HIM BUT BORE ME TO THE SUMMIT OF THE ARCH WHICH FROM THE FOURTH DIKE TO THE FIFTH IS PASSAGE
HAVE I GREAT GRATITUDE FROM THEE
WHEN FROM A MALE A FEMALE HE BECAME HIS MEMBERS BEING ALL OF THEM TRANSFORMED AND AFTERWARDS WAS FORCED TO STRIKE ONCE MORE THE TWO ENTANGLED SERPENTS WITH HIS ROD ERE HE COULD HAVE AGAIN HIS MANLY PLUMES
WHO BY HIS HEART AND CUNNING THE COLCHIANS OF THE RAM MADE DESTITUTE HE BY THE ISLE OF LEMNOS PASSED ALONG AFTER THE DARING WOMEN PITILESS HAD UNTO DEATH DEVOTED ALL THEIR MALES THERE WITH HIS TOKENS AND WITH ORNATE WORDS DID HE DECEIVE HYPSIPYLE
EITHER THAT ANGER OR THAT CONSCIENCE STUNG HIM HE STRUGGLED VIOLENTLY WITH BOTH HIS FEET I THINK IN SOOTH THAT IT MY LEADER PLEASED WITH SUCH CONTENTED LIP HE LISTENED EVER
BECAUSE I FIRES BEHELD AND HEARD LAMENTS WHEREAT I TREMBLING ALL THE CLOSER CLING I SAW THEN FOR BEFORE I HAD NOT SEEN IT THE TURNING AND DESCENDING BY GREAT HORRORS THAT WERE APPROACHING UPON DIVERS SIDES
THEN SIGHING WITH A VOICE OF LAMENTATION SAID TO ME THEN WHAT WANTEST THOU OF ME IF WHO I AM THOU CAREST SO MUCH TO KNOW THAT THOU ON THAT ACCOUNT HAST CROSSED THE BANK KNOW THAT I VESTED WAS WITH THE GREAT MANTLE
IN THIS WISE I EXCLAIMED WITH FACE UPLIFTED AND THE THREE TAKING THAT FOR MY REPLY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AS ONE LOOKS AT TRUTH IF OTHER TIMES SO LITTLE IT DOTH COST THEE REPLIED THEY ALL TO SATISFY ANOTHER HAPPY ART THOU
AND HEREWITH LET OUR SIGHT BE SATISFIED
DOWN AT THE BOTTOM WERE THE SINNERS NAKED THIS SIDE THE MIDDLE CAME THEY FACING US BEYOND IT WITH US BUT WITH GREATER STEPS EVEN AS THE ROMANS FOR THE MIGHTY HOST THE YEAR OF JUBILEE UPON THE BRIDGE HAVE CHOSEN A MODE TO PASS THE PEOPLE OVER
BUT I PERCEIVE IT ONLY BY WIND UPON MY FACE AND FROM BELOW I HEARD ALREADY ON THE RIGHT THE WHIRLPOOL MAKING A HORRIBLE CRASHING UNDER US WHENCE I THRUST OUT MY HEAD WITH EYES CAST DOWNWARD THEN WAS I STILL MORE FEARFUL OF THE ABYSS
WITHIN THIS PLACE DOWN SHAKEN FROM THE BACK OF GERYON WE FOUND US AND THE POET HELD TO THE LEFT AND I MOVED ON BEHIND UPON MY RIGHT HAND I BEHELD NEW ANGUISH NEW TORMENTS AND NEW WIELDERS OF THE LASH WHEREWITH THE FOREMOST BOLGIA WAS REPLETE
THINK NOW FOR THYSELF HOW I COULD EVER KEEP MY FACE UNMOISTENED WHEN OUR OWN IMAGE NEAR ME I BEHELD DISTORTED SO THE WEEPING OF THE EYES ALONG THE FISSURE BATHED THE HINDER PARTS TRULY I WEPT LEANING UPON A PEAK OF THE HARD CRAG
AND HAS DISTINCT IN VALLEYS TEN ITS BOTTOM AS WHERE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE WALLS MANY AND MANY MOATS SURROUND THE CASTLES THE PART IN WHICH THEY ARE A FIGURE FORMS JUST SUCH AN IMAGE THOSE PRESENTED THERE
THERE TENDERLY HE LAID HIS BURDEN DOWN TENDERLY ON THE CRAG UNEVEN AND STEEP THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD PASSAGE FOR THE GOATS THENCE WAS UNVEILED TO ME ANOTHER VALLEY
WITHOUT OTHER OMEN ITS PEOPLE ONCE WITHIN MORE CROWDED WERE ERE THE STUPIDITY OF CASALODI FROM PINAMONTE HAD RECEIVED DECEIT THEREFORE I CAUTION THEE IF E'ER THOU HEAREST ORIGINATE MY CITY OTHERWISE NO FALSEHOOD MAY THE VERITY DEFRAUD
HE SAID TO THESE WE SHOULD BE COURTEOUS
THE MAIDEN WHO FIRST HERSELF HAD ALL THE REST DECEIVED THERE DID HE LEAVE HER PREGNANT AND FORLORN SUCH SIN UNTO SUCH PUNISHMENT CONDEMNS HIM AND ALSO FOR MEDEA IS VENGEANCE DONE
I JOINED MYSELF AGAIN UNTO MINE ESCORT THEREAFTERWARD WITH FOOTSTEPS FEW WE CAME TO WHERE A CRAG PROJECTED FROM THE BANK THIS VERY EASILY DID WE ASCEND AND TURNING TO THE RIGHT ALONG ITS RIDGE FROM THOSE ETERNAL CIRCLES WE DEPARTED
THEY WOULD HAVE SNAPPED ASUNDER WITHES AND BANDS EVEN AS THE FLAME OF UNCTUOUS THINGS IS WONT TO MOVE UPON THE OUTER SURFACE ONLY SO LIKEWISE WAS IT THERE FROM HEEL TO POINT MASTER WHO IS THAT ONE WHO WRITHES HIMSELF
THE BACK AND BREAST AND BOTH THE SIDES IT HAD DEPICTED O'ER WITH NOOSES AND WITH SHIELDS WITH COLOURS MORE GROUNDWORK OR BROIDERY NEVER IN CLOTH DID TARTARS MAKE NOR TURKS NOR WERE SUCH TISSUES BY ARACHNE LAID
THE GUIDE SAID WAIT AND SEE THAT ON THEE STRIKE THE VISION OF THOSE OTHERS EVIL BORN OF WHOM THOU HAST NOT YET BEHELD THE FACES BECAUSE TOGETHER WITH US THEY HAVE GONE FROM THE OLD BRIDGE WE LOOKED UPON THE TRAIN WHICH TOW'RDS US CAME UPON THE OTHER BORDER
SITTETH PESCHIERA FORTRESS FAIR AND STRONG TO FRONT THE BRESCIANS AND THE BERGAMASKS WHERE ROUND ABOUT THE BANK DESCENDETH LOWEST THERE OF NECESSITY MUST FALL WHATEVER IN BOSOM OF BENACO CANNOT STAY AND GROWS A RIVER DOWN THROUGH VERDANT PASTURES
IT MUST NEEDS BE SOME NOVELTY RESPOND I SAID WITHIN MYSELF TO THE NEW SIGNAL THE MASTER WITH HIS EYE IS FOLLOWING SO AH ME HOW VERY CAUTIOUS MEN SHOULD BE WITH THOSE WHO NOT ALONE BEHOLD THE ACT BUT WITH THEIR WISDOM LOOK INTO THE THOUGHTS
I FOLLOWED HIM AND LITTLE HAD WE GONE BEFORE THE SOUND OF WATER WAS SO NEAR US THAT SPEAKING WE SHOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN HEARD EVEN AS THAT STREAM WHICH HOLDETH ITS OWN COURSE THE FIRST FROM MONTE VESO TOW'RDS THE EAST
THEN THEY BROKE UP THE WHEEL AND IN THEIR FLIGHT IT SEEMED AS IF THEIR AGILE LEGS WERE WINGS NOT AN AMEN COULD POSSIBLY BE SAID SO RAPIDLY AS THEY HAD DISAPPEARED WHEREFORE THE MASTER DEEMED BEST TO DEPART
NOT OTHERWISE IN SUMMER DO THE DOGS NOW WITH THE FOOT NOW WITH THE MUZZLE WHEN BY FLEAS OR FLIES OR GADFLIES THEY ARE BITTEN WHEN I HAD TURNED MINE EYES UPON THE FACES OF SOME ON WHOM THE DOLOROUS FIRE IS FALLING NOT ONE OF THEM I KNEW
YE WHO THE THINGS OF GOD WHICH OUGHT TO BE THE BRIDES OF HOLINESS RAPACIOUSLY FOR SILVER AND FOR GOLD DO PROSTITUTE NOW IT BEHOVES FOR YOU THE TRUMPET SOUND BECAUSE IN THIS THIRD BOLGIA YE ABIDE
NOW GET THEE GONE AND SINCE THOU'RT STILL ALIVE KNOW THAT A NEIGHBOUR OF MINE VITALIANO WILL HAVE HIS SEAT HERE ON MY LEFT HAND SIDE A PADUAN AM I WITH THESE FLORENTINES FULL MANY A TIME THEY THUNDER IN MINE EARS EXCLAIMING COME THE SOVEREIGN CAVALIER
AH ME WHAT WOUNDS I SAW UPON THEIR LIMBS RECENT AND ANCIENT BY THE FLAMES BURNT IN IT PAINS ME STILL BUT TO REMEMBER IT UNTO THEIR CRIES MY TEACHER PAUSED ATTENTIVE HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS ME AND NOW WAIT
AND TRULY MY SAVAGE WIFE MORE THAN AUGHT ELSE DOTH HARM ME COULD I HAVE BEEN PROTECTED FROM THE FIRE
WHO FEELS COMPASSION AT THE DOOM DIVINE LIFT UP LIFT UP THY HEAD AND SEE FOR WHOM OPENED THE EARTH BEFORE THE THEBANS EYES WHEREFORE THEY ALL CRIED WHITHER RUSHEST THOU AMPHIARAUS WHY DOST LEAVE THE WAR
NOR PETER NOR THE REST ASKED OF MATTHIAS SILVER OR GOLD WHEN HE BY LOT WAS CHOSEN UNTO THE PLACE THE GUILTY SOUL HAD LOST THEREFORE STAY HERE FOR THOU ART JUSTLY PUNISHED
OF THE FIRST SONG WHICH IS OF THE SUBMERGED I WAS ALREADY THOROUGHLY DISPOSED TO PEER DOWN INTO THE UNCOVERED DEPTH WHICH BATHED ITSELF WITH TEARS OF AGONY AND PEOPLE SAW I THROUGH THE CIRCULAR VALLEY SILENT AND WEEPING
IT WAS NOT CLEAR IF HE WERE CLERK OR LAYMAN HE SCREAMED TO ME WHEREFORE ART THOU SO EAGER TO LOOK AT ME MORE THAN THE OTHER FOUL ONES AND I TO HIM BECAUSE IF I REMEMBER I HAVE ALREADY SEEN THEE WITH DRY HAIR
AND THAT EXTENDED LIKE AN EEL HE MOVED AND WITH HIS PAWS DREW TO HIMSELF THE AIR A GREATER FEAR I DO NOT THINK THERE WAS WHAT TIME ABANDONED PHAETON THE REINS WHEREBY THE HEAVENS AS STILL APPEARS WERE SCORCHED
THEN SAID HE TO ME HE WHO FROM THE CHEEK THRUSTS OUT HIS BEARD UPON HIS SWARTHY SHOULDERS WAS AT THE TIME WHEN GREECE WAS VOID OF MALES SO THAT THERE SCARCE REMAINED ONE IN THE CRADLE AN AUGUR AND WITH CALCHAS GAVE THE MOMENT IN AULIS
THENCE WE HEARD PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING MOAN IN THE NEXT BOLGIA SNORTING WITH THEIR MUZZLES AND WITH THEIR PALMS BEATING UPON THEMSELVES THE MARGINS WERE INCRUSTED WITH A MOULD BY EXHALATION FROM BELOW THAT STICKS THERE AND WITH THE EYES AND NOSTRILS WAGES WAR
AS IF BEMOCKED AND KNOW NOT HOW TO ANSWER THEN SAID VIRGILIUS SAY TO HIM STRAIGHTWAY I AM NOT HE I AM NOT HE THOU THINKEST AND I REPLIED AS WAS IMPOSED ON ME
WHO NOW UNTO HIS LEATHER AND HIS THREAD WOULD FAIN HAVE STUCK BUT HE TOO LATE REPENTS BEHOLD THE WRETCHED ONES WHO LEFT THE NEEDLE THE SPOOL AND ROCK AND MADE THEM FORTUNE TELLERS THEY WROUGHT THEIR MAGIC SPELLS WITH HERB AND IMAGE
AND I WHAT PLEASES THEE TO ME IS PLEASING THOU ART MY LORD AND KNOWEST THAT I DEPART NOT FROM THY DESIRE AND KNOWEST WHAT IS NOT SPOKEN STRAIGHTWAY UPON THE FOURTH DIKE WE ARRIVED
BUT COME NOW FOR ALREADY HOLDS THE CONFINES OF BOTH THE HEMISPHERES AND UNDER SEVILLE TOUCHES THE OCEAN WAVE CAIN AND THE THORNS AND YESTERNIGHT THE MOON WAS ROUND ALREADY THOU SHOULDST REMEMBER WELL IT DID NOT HARM THEE FROM TIME TO TIME WITHIN THE FOREST DEEP
THITHER WE CAME AND THENCE DOWN IN THE MOAT I SAW A PEOPLE SMOTHERED IN A FILTH THAT OUT OF HUMAN PRIVIES SEEMED TO FLOW AND WHILST BELOW THERE WITH MINE EYE I SEARCH I SAW ONE WITH HIS HEAD SO FOUL WITH ORDURE
SOON AS THE WATER DOTH BEGIN TO RUN NO MORE BENACO IS IT CALLED BUT MINCIO FAR AS GOVERNO WHERE IT FALLS IN PO NOT FAR IT RUNS BEFORE IT FINDS A PLAIN IN WHICH IT SPREADS ITSELF AND MAKES IT MARSHY
WHEN SHADOWS THREE TOGETHER STARTED FORTH RUNNING FROM OUT A COMPANY THAT PASSED BENEATH THE RAIN OF THE SHARP MARTYRDOM TOWARDS US CAME THEY AND EACH ONE CRIED OUT STOP THOU FOR BY THY GARB TO US THOU SEEMEST TO BE SOME ONE OF OUR DEPRAVED CITY
BUT ON THE BORDER DID NOT DRAG ITS TAIL THE FACE WAS AS THE FACE OF A JUST MAN ITS SEMBLANCE OUTWARDLY WAS SO BENIGN AND OF A SERPENT ALL THE TRUNK BESIDE TWO PAWS IT HAD HAIRY UNTO THE ARMPITS
BY MANY YEARS THE RECORD LIED TO ME ART THOU SO EARLY SATIATE WITH THAT WEALTH FOR WHICH THOU DIDST NOT FEAR TO TAKE BY FRAUD THE BEAUTIFUL LADY AND THEN WORK HER WOE SUCH I BECAME AS PEOPLE ARE WHO STAND NOT COMPREHENDING WHAT IS ANSWERED THEM
HE WHO SHALL BRING THE SATCHEL WITH THREE GOATS THEN TWISTED HE HIS MOUTH AND FORTH HE THRUST HIS TONGUE LIKE TO AN OX THAT LICKS ITS NOSE AND FEARING LEST MY LONGER STAY MIGHT VEX HIM WHO HAD WARNED ME NOT TO TARRY LONG BACKWARD I TURNED ME FROM THOSE WEARY SOULS
WHILE SPEAKING IN THIS MANNER WITH HIS SCOURGE A DEMON SMOTE HIM
AFTER I THIS HAD ALL FROM ME UNLOOSED AS MY CONDUCTOR HAD COMMANDED ME I REACHED IT TO HIM GATHERED UP AND COILED WHEREAT HE TURNED HIMSELF TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THE VERGE HE CAST IT DOWN INTO THAT DEEP ABYSS
I LEAVE THE GALL AND GO FOR THE SWEET FRUITS PROMISED TO ME BY THE VERACIOUS LEADER BUT TO THE CENTRE FIRST I NEEDS MUST PLUNGE SO MAY THE SOUL FOR A LONG WHILE CONDUCT THOSE LIMBS OF THINE DID HE MAKE ANSWER THEN
THE BOTTOM IS SO DEEP NO PLACE SUFFICES TO GIVE US SIGHT OF IT
THUS FARTHER STILL UPON THE OUTERMOST HEAD OF THAT SEVENTH CIRCLE ALL ALONE I WENT WHERE SAT THE MELANCHOLY FOLK OUT OF THEIR EYES WAS GUSHING FORTH THEIR WOE THIS WAY THAT WAY THEY HELPED THEM WITH THEIR HANDS NOW FROM THE FLAMES AND NOW FROM THE HOT SOIL
AS FAR AS MINOS WHO LAYS HOLD ON ALL SEE HE HAS MADE A BOSOM OF HIS SHOULDERS BECAUSE HE WISHED TO SEE TOO FAR BEFORE HIM BEHIND HE LOOKS AND BACKWARD GOES HIS WAY
AS SOON AS THIS MY LORD SAID UNTO ME WORDS ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH I THOUGHT WITHIN ME THAT PEOPLE SUCH AS YOU ARE WERE APPROACHING I OF YOUR CITY AM AND EVERMORE YOUR LABOURS AND YOUR HONOURABLE NAMES I WITH AFFECTION HAVE RETRACED AND HEARD
AS SOON AS WE STOOD STILL THEY RECOMMENCED THE OLD REFRAIN AND WHEN THEY OVERTOOK US FORMED OF THEMSELVES A WHEEL ALL THREE OF THEM AS CHAMPIONS STRIPPED AND OILED ARE WONT TO DO WATCHING FOR THEIR ADVANTAGE AND THEIR HOLD BEFORE THEY COME TO BLOWS AND THRUSTS BETWEEN THEM
WITH HIM GO THOSE WHO IN SUCH WISE DECEIVE AND THIS SUFFICIENT BE OF THE FIRST VALLEY TO KNOW AND THOSE THAT IN ITS JAWS IT HOLDS WE WERE ALREADY WHERE THE NARROW PATH CROSSES ATHWART THE SECOND DIKE
THUS WHEELING ROUND DID EVERY ONE HIS VISAGE DIRECT TO ME SO THAT IN OPPOSITE WISE HIS NECK AND FEET CONTINUAL JOURNEY MADE AND IF THE MISERY OF THIS SOFT PLACE BRING IN DISDAIN OURSELVES AND OUR ENTREATIES BEGAN ONE AND OUR ASPECT BLACK AND BLISTERED
AMONG THE MARBLES WHITE A CAVERN HAD FOR HIS ABODE WHENCE TO BEHOLD THE STARS AND SEA THE VIEW WAS NOT CUT OFF FROM HIM AND SHE THERE WHO IS COVERING UP HER BREASTS WHICH THOU BEHOLDEST NOT WITH LOOSENED TRESSES
BECAUSE YOUR AVARICE AFFLICTS THE WORLD TRAMPLING THE GOOD AND LIFTING THE DEPRAVED THE EVANGELIST YOU PASTORS HAD IN MIND WHEN SHE WHO SITTETH UPON MANY WATERS TO FORNICATE WITH KINGS BY HIM WAS SEEN
THE CIRCLES LARGE AND THE DESCENT BE LITTLE THINK OF THE NOVEL BURDEN WHICH THOU HAST EVEN AS THE LITTLE VESSEL SHOVES FROM SHORE BACKWARD STILL BACKWARD SO HE THENCE WITHDREW AND WHEN HE WHOLLY FELT HIMSELF AFLOAT THERE WHERE HIS BREAST HAD BEEN HE TURNED HIS TAIL
AND WHICH THE SCOURGES IN LIKE MANNER SMITE AND THE GOOD MASTER WITHOUT MY INQUIRING SAID TO ME SEE THAT TALL ONE WHO IS COMING AND FOR HIS PAIN SEEMS NOT TO SHED A TEAR STILL WHAT A ROYAL ASPECT HE RETAINS THAT JASON IS
LET THE RENOWN OF US THY MIND INCLINE TO TELL US WHO THOU ART WHO THUS SECURELY THY LIVING FEET DOST MOVE ALONG THROUGH HELL HE IN WHOSE FOOTPRINTS THOU DOST SEE ME TREADING NAKED AND SKINLESS THOUGH HE NOW MAY GO WAS OF A GREATER RANK THAN THOU DOST THINK
AND ON THAT SIDE HAS ALL THE HAIRY SKIN WAS MANTO WHO MADE QUEST THROUGH MANY LANDS AFTERWARDS TARRIED THERE WHERE I WAS BORN WHEREOF I WOULD THOU LIST TO ME A LITTLE AFTER HER FATHER HAD FROM LIFE DEPARTED
BUT I PERCEIVED THAT FROM THE NECK OF EACH THERE HUNG A POUCH WHICH CERTAIN COLOUR HAD AND CERTAIN BLAZON AND THEREUPON IT SEEMS THEIR EYES ARE FEEDING AND AS I GAZING ROUND ME COME AMONG THEM UPON A YELLOW POUCH I AZURE SAW THAT HAD THE FACE AND POSTURE OF A LION
HIS TAIL WAS WHOLLY QUIVERING IN THE VOID CONTORTING UPWARDS THE ENVENOMED FORK THAT IN THE GUISE OF SCORPION ARMED ITS POINT THE GUIDE SAID NOW PERFORCE MUST TURN ASIDE OUR WAY A LITTLE
THE SAME WHO WITH THE SEVEN HEADS WAS BORN AND POWER AND STRENGTH FROM THE TEN HORNS RECEIVED SO LONG AS VIRTUE TO HER SPOUSE WAS PLEASING YE HAVE MADE YOURSELVES A GOD OF GOLD AND SILVER AND FROM THE IDOLATER HOW DIFFER YE SAVE THAT HE ONE
BEHOLD GUIDO BONATTI
FOR AFTER HIM SHALL COME OF FOULER DEED FROM TOW'RDS THE WEST A PASTOR WITHOUT LAW SUCH AS BEFITS TO COVER HIM AND ME NEW JASON WILL HE BE OF WHOM WE READ IN MACCABEES AND AS HIS KING WAS PLIANT SO HE WHO GOVERNS FRANCE SHALL BE TO THIS ONE
AS SOMETIMES WHERRIES LIE UPON THE SHORE THAT PART ARE IN THE WATER PART ON LAND AND AS AMONG THE GUZZLING GERMANS THERE THE BEAVER PLANTS HIMSELF TO WAGE HIS WAR SO THAT VILE MONSTER LAY UPON THE BORDER WHICH IS OF STONE AND SHUTTETH IN THE SAND
ALREADY WITH SIGHT OF THIS ONE I AM NOT UNFED THEREFORE I STAYED MY FEET TO MAKE HIM OUT AND WITH ME THE SWEET GUIDE CAME TO A STAND AND TO MY GOING SOMEWHAT BACK ASSENTED
WHICH IS ABOVE CALLED ACQUACHETA ERE IT DOWN DESCENDETH INTO ITS LOW BED AND AT FORLI IS VACANT OF THAT NAME REVERBERATES THERE ABOVE SAN BENEDETTO FROM ALPS BY FALLING AT A SINGLE LEAP WHERE FOR A THOUSAND THERE WERE ROOM ENOUGH
WITH US OF LATE AND GOES THERE WITH HIS COMRADES DOTH GREATLY MORTIFY US WITH HIS WORDS THE NEW INHABITANTS AND THE SUDDEN GAINS PRIDE AND EXTRAVAGANCE HAVE IN THEE ENGENDERED FLORENCE SO THAT THOU WEEP'ST THEREAT ALREADY
PROCEEDING THEN THE CURRENT OF MY SIGHT ANOTHER OF THEM SAW I RED AS BLOOD DISPLAY A GOOSE MORE WHITE THAN BUTTER IS AND ONE WHO WITH AN AZURE SOW AND GRAVID EMBLAZONED HAD HIS LITTLE POUCH OF WHITE SAID UNTO ME WHAT DOST THOU IN THIS MOAT
MORE THAN HIS OTHER COMRADES QUIVERING I SAID AND WHOM A REDDER FLAME IS SUCKING AND HE TO ME IF THOU WILT HAVE ME BEAR THEE DOWN THERE ALONG THAT BANK WHICH LOWEST LIES
SO THAT MY ESCORT SAID TO ME ART THOU TOO OF THE OTHER FOOLS HERE PITY LIVES WHEN IT IS WHOLLY DEAD
UNWILLINGLY I TELL IT BUT FORCES ME THINE UTTERANCE DISTINCT WHICH MAKES ME RECOLLECT THE ANCIENT WORLD I WAS THE ONE WHO THE FAIR GHISOLA INDUCED TO GRANT THE WISHES OF THE MARQUIS HOWE'ER THE SHAMELESS STORY MAY BE TOLD
ALL OF ONE SIZE AND EVERY ONE WAS ROUND TO ME LESS AMPLE SEEMED THEY NOT NOR GREATER THAN THOSE THAT IN MY BEAUTIFUL SAINT JOHN ARE FASHIONED FOR THE PLACE OF THE BAPTISERS AND ONE OF WHICH NOT MANY YEARS AGO I BROKE FOR SOME ONE WHO WAS DROWNING IN IT
WE THEREFORE ON THE RIGHT SIDE DESCENDED AND MADE TEN STEPS UPON THE OUTER VERGE COMPLETELY TO AVOID THE SAND AND FLAME AND AFTER WE ARE COME TO HIM I SEE A LITTLE FARTHER OFF UPON THE SAND A PEOPLE SITTING NEAR THE HOLLOW PLACE
AND IN LIFE MUCH DID HE WITH HIS WISDOM AND HIS SWORD THE OTHER WHO CLOSE BY ME TREADS THE SAND TEGGHIAIO ALDOBRANDI IS WHOSE FAME ABOVE THERE IN THE WORLD SHOULD WELCOME BE AND I WHO WITH THEM ON THE CROSS AM PLACED JACOPO RUSTICUCCI WAS
THEIR NAMES WERE HOBART AND ROBART THE LITTLE GIRL'S NAME WAS MARY AND SHE WAS VERY HAPPY INDEED WHEN HER FATHER AND HER BROTHERS WERE AT HOME FOR THEY PETTED HER AND PLAYED GAMES WITH HER AND LOVED HER VERY DEARLY
NOR ONE LUCKY OVERTURN TO INTRODUCE THEM TO THE HERO NOTHING MORE ALARMING OCCURRED THAN A FEAR ON MISSUS ALLEN'S SIDE OF HAVING ONCE LEFT HER CLOGS BEHIND HER AT AN INN
WE SHALL DO BETTER ANOTHER EVENING I HOPE WAS MISTER ALLEN'S CONSOLATION THE COMPANY BEGAN TO DISPERSE WHEN THE DANCING WAS OVER ENOUGH TO LEAVE SPACE FOR THE REMAINDER TO WALK ABOUT IN SOME COMFORT
COULD NOT TAKE PLACE TILL AFTER THREE OR FOUR DAYS HAD BEEN SPENT IN LEARNING WHAT WAS MOSTLY WORN AND HER CHAPERONE WAS PROVIDED WITH A DRESS OF THE NEWEST FASHION CATHERINE TOO MADE SOME PURCHASES HERSELF
AND HOW ABOUT THE COCKLE SHELLS THEM ALSO I KNOW SAID MARY EAGERLY FOR SHE WAS GLAD HER FATHER SHOULD FIND HER SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE FIELD FLOWERS THERE IS NOTHING PRETTIER THAN THE BIG WHITE FLOWERS OF THE COCKLE SHELLS
AND THEN HE CONTINUED T IS APTLY SAID BUT PRITHEE MAID WHY THUS YOUR GARDEN FILL WHEN EV'RY FIELD THE SAME FLOWERS YIELD TO PLUCK THEM AS YOU WILL THAT IS A LONG STORY SQUIRE
MISSUS ALLEN MADE HER WAY THROUGH THE THRONG OF MEN BY THE DOOR AS SWIFTLY AS THE NECESSARY CAUTION WOULD ALLOW CATHERINE HOWEVER KEPT CLOSE AT HER SIDE AND LINKED HER ARM TOO FIRMLY WITHIN HER FRIEND'S TO BE TORN ASUNDER BY ANY COMMON EFFORT OF A STRUGGLING ASSEMBLY
THE WEATHER NOW BEGAN TO CHANGE AND THE COLD SEA WINDS BLEW EACH NIGHT OVER MARY'S GARDEN SHE DID NOT KNOW THIS FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS LYING SNUGLY TUCKED UP IN HER BED
ARE ALL WITHERED AND FADED AWAY AND DID YOU NOT SAY THAT GOD WILLING WHEN THIS HAPPENED YOU WOULD COME BACK TO US TO BE SURE I DID ANSWERED HER FATHER WITH A HAPPY LAUGH AND I MUST HAVE SPOKEN TRULY SWEETHEART
IN WHICH DWELT A SAILOR AND HIS WIFE WITH THEIR TWO STRONG SONS AND A LITTLE GIRL THE SONS WERE ALSO SAILORS AND HAD MADE SEVERAL VOYAGES WITH THEIR FATHER IN A PRETTY SHIP CALLED THE SKYLARK
AND HOW LONG WILL YOU BE GONE PAPA ASKED MARY WHO WAS PERCHED UPON HER FATHER'S KNEE WHERE SHE COULD NESTLE HER SOFT CHEEK AGAINST HIS BUSHY WHISKERS
SQUIRE TOOK HER TOWARD THE LITTLE BROOK THAT WANDERED THROUGH THE MEADOWS FLOWING OVER THE PEBBLES WITH A SOFT GURGLING SOUND THAT WAS VERY NEARLY AS SWEET AS MUSIC AND WHEN THEY REACHED IT THE BIG SQUIRE SAID IF YOU WILL LOOK BESIDE THE BROOK
HOW DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ARE GROWING OH SQUIRE SOBBED MARY I AM IN GREAT TROUBLE EACH DINGLE BELL I LOVED SO WELL BEFORE MY EYES IS DYING
FOR WE BOTH SHALL BE GLAD TO WELCOME OUR DEAR ONES HOME AGAIN BUT SOON AFTERWARD THE BIG BLUFF SQUIRE CAME RIDING UP AS WAS HIS WONT TO WHERE MARY STOOD BY HER GARDEN AND HE AT ONCE ASKED
AND AFTERWARDS DROVE THROUGH THOSE STREETS WHICH CONDUCTED THEM TO THE HOTEL SHE WAS COME TO BE HAPPY AND SHE FELT HAPPY ALREADY THEY WERE SOON SETTLED IN COMFORTABLE LODGINGS IN PULTENEY STREET
GARDENS ARE ALL WELL ENOUGH FOR FANCY FLOWERS TO GROW IN BUT THE POSIES THAT GOD GAVE TO ALL THE WORLD AND MADE TO GROW WILD IN THE GREAT GARDEN OF NATURE
AND NOW SHE PERMITTED MARY TO MAKE HER OWN GARDEN AND PLANT IT AS SHE WOULD SO MARY MADE A LONG NARROW BED AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND THEN SHE PREPARED TO PLANT HER FLOWERS IF YOU SCATTER THE SEEDS SAID HER MOTHER
SHE IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT THE EVENING PLEASANTER THAN SHE HAD FOUND IT BEFORE HER HUMBLE VANITY WAS CONTENTED SHE FELT MORE OBLIGED TO THE TWO YOUNG MEN FOR THIS SIMPLE PRAISE THAN A TRUE QUALITY HEROINE
AND THAT FORTUNATELY PROVED TO BE GROUNDLESS THEY ARRIVED AT BATH CATHERINE WAS ALL EAGER DELIGHT HER EYES WERE HERE THERE EVERYWHERE AS THEY APPROACHED ITS FINE AND STRIKING ENVIRONS
AND IN THE END SHE PLANTED THE DINGLE BELLS ALL IN ONE STRAIGHT ROW AND THE COCKLE SHELLS IN ANOTHER STRAIGHT ROW THE LENGTH OF THE BED AND SHE FINISHED BY PLANTING THE COWSLIPS IN ANOTHER LONG ROW AT THE BACK HER MOTHER SMILED BUT SAID NOTHING
MUST FROM SITUATION BE AT THIS TIME THE INTIMATE FRIEND AND CONFIDANTE OF HER SISTER IT IS REMARKABLE HOWEVER THAT SHE NEITHER INSISTED ON CATHERINE'S WRITING BY EVERY POST
WHO HAD HEARD WHAT THE SAILOR HAD SAID TO HIS LITTLE GIRL KNEW AT ONCE WHAT MARY MEANT SO SHE KISSED HER DAUGHTER AND REPLIED YES MARY YOU MAY HAVE THE FLOWER GARDEN IF YOU WISH WE WILL DIG A NICE LITTLE BED JUST AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE
THE FLOWER BED WILL LOOK VERY PRETTY NOW THIS WAS WHAT MARY WAS ABOUT TO DO BUT SINCE HER MOTHER ADVISED IT SHE TRIED TO THINK OF ANOTHER WAY FOR AS I SAID SHE WAS CONTRARY AT TIMES
WHICH WAS THE ONLY TIME THAT ANYBODY SPOKE TO THEM DURING THE EVENING TILL THEY WERE DISCOVERED AND JOINED BY MISTER ALLEN WHEN THE DANCE WAS OVER WELL MISS MORLAND SAID HE DIRECTLY I HOPE YOU HAVE HAD AN AGREEABLE BALL
YOU LL SEE I KNOW QUITE WELL THAT HIDDEN IN EACH MOSSY NOOK IS MANY A COCKLE SHELL THIS WAS INDEED TRUE AND AS MARY SAW THEM SHE SUDDENLY DROPPED HER HEAD AND BEGAN TO WEEP
THEY SAW NOTHING OF THE DANCERS BUT THE HIGH FEATHERS OF SOME OF THE LADIES STILL THEY MOVED ON SOMETHING BETTER WAS YET IN VIEW AND BY A CONTINUED EXERTION OF STRENGTH AND INGENUITY
AND HER MOTHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE THE HOURS WERE VERY DULL AND TEDIOUS AND MARY COUNTED THE DAYS UNTIL THE SAILORS CAME HOME AGAIN ONE SPRING
I WANT THEM IN FRONT PERSISTED MARY FOR THE SUN SHINES STRONGER THERE VERY WELL ANSWERED HER MOTHER MAKE YOUR GARDEN AT THE FRONT IF YOU WILL
TO HIS GRAY MARE AND RODE AWAY THE VERY NEXT DAY TO MARY'S GREAT SURPRISE AND GRIEF SHE FOUND THE LEAVES OF THE DINGLE BELLS CURLING AND BEGINNING TO WITHER OH MAMMA SHE CALLED COME QUICK
I WISH YOU COULD DANCE MY DEAR I WISH YOU COULD GET A PARTNER FOR SOME TIME HER YOUNG FRIEND FELT OBLIGED TO HER FOR THESE WISHES BUT THEY WERE REPEATED SO OFTEN
I SHALL COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN LITTLE ONE AND WATCH THE GARDEN GROW
BUT TO HER UTTER AMAZEMENT SHE FOUND THAT TO PROCEED ALONG THE ROOM WAS BY NO MEANS THE WAY TO DISENGAGE THEMSELVES FROM THE CROWD IT SEEMED RATHER TO INCREASE AS THEY WENT ON
AND PROVED SO TOTALLY INEFFECTUAL THAT CATHERINE GREW TIRED AT LAST AND WOULD THANK HER NO MORE THEY WERE NOT LONG ABLE HOWEVER TO ENJOY THE REPOSE OF THE EMINENCE THEY HAD SO LABORIOUSLY GAINED
AND SAW A LITTLE SPECK UPON THE WATERS THAT LOOKED LIKE A SAIL AND WHEN IT CAME NEARER AND HAD GROWN LARGER BOTH SHE AND HER MOTHER SAW THAT IT WAS THE SKYLARK COME HOME AGAIN
AND MARY EXCLAIMED A DINGLE BELL AND TRUTH TO TELL IN FULL BLOOM I DECLARE THE SQUIRE NOW CLUCKED TO HIS NAG AND AS THEY RODE AWAY HE SAID NOW COME WITH ME AND YOU SHALL SEE A FIELD WITH COWSLIPS BRIGHT
WITH A DEGREE OF MODERATION AND COMPOSURE WHICH SEEMED RATHER CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMON FEELINGS OF COMMON LIFE THAN WITH THE REFINED SUSCEPTIBILITIES THE TENDER EMOTIONS WHICH THE FIRST SEPARATION OF A HEROINE FROM HER FAMILY OUGHT ALWAYS TO EXCITE
FOR THEY ARE THE BIGGEST AND STRONGEST AND THE DINGLE BELLS SHALL BE BROTHER HOBART AND THE COWSLIPS BROTHER ROBART AND NOW I FEEL AS IF THE FLOWERS WERE REALLY MY DEAR ONES AND I MUST BE VERY CAREFUL THAT THEY COME TO NO HARM
WHEN YOU COME FROM THE ROOMS AT NIGHT AND I WISH YOU WOULD TRY TO KEEP SOME ACCOUNT OF THE MONEY YOU SPEND I WILL GIVE YOU THIS LITTLE BOOK ON PURPOSE SALLY OR RATHER SARAH
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN MARY AND HER MOTHER HAD DRIED THEIR EYES WHICH HAD BEEN WET WITH GRIEF AT THE DEPARTURE OF THEIR LOVED ONES THE LITTLE GIRL ASKED EARNESTLY MAMMA MAY I MAKE A FLOWER GARDEN
I KNEW YOU WERE COMING SOON PAPA AND HOW DID YOU KNOW SWEETHEART HE ASKED GIVING HER AN EXTRA KISS BECAUSE I WATCHED THE FLOWERS
MARY'S MOTHER KNEW THAT THE HARSH WINDS HAD KILLED THE FLOWERS BEFORE THEIR TIME BUT SHE DID NOT LIKE TO DISAPPOINT HER DARLING SO SHE ONLY SAID WITH A SIGH I HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT MARY
SHE WAS NOW SEEN BY MANY YOUNG MEN WHO HAD NOT BEEN NEAR HER BEFORE NOT ONE HOWEVER STARTED WITH RAPTUROUS WONDER ON BEHOLDING HER NO WHISPER OF EAGER INQUIRY RAN ROUND THE ROOM
JUST AS THE GRASSES BEGAN TO GROW GREEN UPON THE CLIFF AND THE TREES WERE DRESSING THEIR STIFF BARREN BRANCHES IN ROBES OF DELICATE FOLIAGE THE FATHER AND BROTHERS BADE GOOD BYE TO MARY AND HER MOTHER FOR THEY WERE STARTING UPON A VOYAGE TO THE BLACK SEA
I HAVE BEEN SAYING HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF THE SKINNERS WERE HERE THIS WINTER INSTEAD OF LAST OR IF THE PARRYS HAD COME AS THEY TALKED OF ONCE SHE MIGHT HAVE DANCED WITH GEORGE PARRY I AM SO SORRY SHE HAS NOT HAD A PARTNER
BEING AS FOND OF GOING EVERYWHERE AND SEEING EVERYTHING HERSELF AS ANY YOUNG LADY COULD BE DRESS WAS HER PASSION SHE HAD A MOST HARMLESS DELIGHT IN BEING FINE AND OUR HEROINE'S ENTREE INTO LIFE
IT WAS ALWAYS VERY WELCOME WHEN IT CAME BUT SHE DID NOT DEPEND ON IT MISSUS ALLEN WAS SO LONG IN DRESSING THAT THEY DID NOT ENTER THE BALLROOM TILL LATE THE SEASON WAS FULL THE ROOM CROWDED
WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR FIFTEEN SONNETS IN CELEBRATION OF HER CHARMS AND WENT TO HER CHAIR IN GOOD HUMOUR WITH EVERYBODY
THAT SHE COULD NOT RELIEVE THE IRKSOMENESS OF IMPRISONMENT BY THE EXCHANGE OF A SYLLABLE WITH ANY OF HER FELLOW CAPTIVES AND WHEN AT LAST ARRIVED IN THE TEA ROOM SHE FELT YET MORE THE AWKWARDNESS OF HAVING NO PARTY TO JOIN
WITHOUT CONCEIT OR AFFECTATION OF ANY KIND HER MANNERS JUST REMOVED FROM THE AWKWARDNESS AND SHYNESS OF A GIRL HER PERSON PLEASING AND WHEN IN GOOD LOOKS PRETTY
BUT MISSUS MORLAND KNEW SO LITTLE OF LORDS AND BARONETS THAT SHE ENTERTAINED NO NOTION OF THEIR GENERAL MISCHIEVOUSNESS AND WAS WHOLLY UNSUSPICIOUS OF DANGER TO HER DAUGHTER FROM THEIR MACHINATIONS
AND BOTH MISSUS ALLEN AND HER MAID DECLARED SHE LOOKED QUITE AS SHE SHOULD DO WITH SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT CATHERINE HOPED AT LEAST TO PASS UNCENSURED THROUGH THE CROWD AS FOR ADMIRATION
SHE WAS LOOKED AT HOWEVER AND WITH SOME ADMIRATION FOR IN HER OWN HEARING TWO GENTLEMEN PRONOUNCED HER TO BE A PRETTY GIRL SUCH WORDS HAD THEIR DUE EFFECT
AND THE WARM MORNING SUN USUALLY DROVE AWAY THE WINDS BUT HER MOTHER KNEW IT AND FEARED MARY'S GARDEN WOULD SUFFER ONE DAY MARY CAME INTO THE HOUSE WHERE HER MOTHER WAS AT WORK AND SAID GLEEFULLY
I WISH WE HAD ANY IT WOULD BE SOMEBODY TO GO TO VERY TRUE MY DEAR AND IF WE KNEW ANYBODY WE WOULD JOIN THEM DIRECTLY THE SKINNERS WERE HERE LAST YEAR I WISH THEY WERE HERE NOW
ASKED THE BIG BLUFF SQUIRE FORGETTING HIS POETRY
AT WHICH A LARGE PARTY WERE ALREADY PLACED WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING TO DO THERE OR ANYBODY TO SPEAK TO EXCEPT EACH OTHER MISSUS ALLEN CONGRATULATED HERSELF AS SOON AS THEY WERE SEATED
STROKING HER CURLS TENDERLY AS HE SPOKE WELL WELL MY DARLING IT WILL BE A LONG TIME INDEED DO YOU KNOW THE COWSLIPS THAT GROW IN THE PASTURES MARY OH YES I WATCH FOR THEM EVERY SPRING SHE ANSWERED
SHE WAS INCLINED TO BE A BIT CONTRARY AND PUT HER OWN OPINIONS AND IDEAS BEFORE THOSE OF HER ELDERS PERHAPS MARY MEANT NO WRONG IN THIS
UNDER THESE UNPROMISING AUSPICES THE PARTING TOOK PLACE AND THE JOURNEY BEGAN IT WAS PERFORMED WITH SUITABLE QUIETNESS AND UNEVENTFUL SAFETY NEITHER ROBBERS NOR TEMPESTS BEFRIENDED THEM
AND BY THE PATH THAT RUNS BESIDE THE WOOD SO HE GAVE THE REIN TO HIS MARE AND THEY RODE ALONG CHATTING MERRILY TOGETHER TILL THEY CAME TO THE WOOD THEN SAID THE SQUIRE TAKE A LOOK WITHIN THAT NOOK AND TELL ME WHAT IS THERE
THEY LOOKED RATHER COMICAL ALL STANDING IN STIFF STRAIGHT ROWS ONE AFTER THE OTHER BUT MARY DID NOT MIND THAT WHILE SHE WAS WORKING SHE HEARD THE TRAMP OF A HORSE'S HOOFS AND LOOKING UP
NOR WAS SHE ONCE CALLED A DIVINITY BY ANYBODY YET CATHERINE WAS IN VERY GOOD LOOKS AND HAD THE COMPANY ONLY SEEN HER THREE YEARS BEFORE THEY WOULD NOW HAVE THOUGHT HER EXCEEDINGLY HANDSOME
YES MY DEAR REPLIED MISSUS ALLEN WITH PERFECT SERENITY IT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE INDEED
AND DINGLE BELLS ARE DELICATE FLOWERS AND GROW BEST WHERE THEY ARE SHELTERED BY THE WOODS IF YOU HAD PLANTED THEM AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AS I WISHED YOU TO THE WIND WOULD NOT HAVE KILLED THEM MARY DID NOT REPLY TO THIS
YOUR FATHER MEANT YOU TO WATCH THE FLOWERS IN THE FIELD AND IF YOU WILL COME AND VISIT THEM EACH DAY YOU WILL FIND THE TIME WAITING VERY SHORT INDEED MARY DRIED HER EYES AND THANKED THE KINDLY OLD SQUIRE
IT MAY BE STATED FOR THE READER'S MORE CERTAIN INFORMATION LEST THE FOLLOWING PAGES SHOULD OTHERWISE FAIL OF GIVING ANY IDEA OF WHAT HER CHARACTER IS MEANT TO BE THAT HER HEART WAS AFFECTIONATE HER DISPOSITION CHEERFUL AND OPEN
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT LAST IN THE PASSAGE BEHIND THE HIGHEST BENCH
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW PLEASED AND HAPPY THE SIGHT OF THE PRETTY LITTLE SHIP MADE THEM AND SOON AFTER WHEN MARY HAD BEEN HUGGED BY HER TWO SUNBURNED BROTHERS AND WAS CLASPED IN HER FATHER'S STRONG ARMS SHE WHISPERED
MISTRESS MARY SO CONTRARY HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW WITH DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW AND MARY BEING A SHARP LITTLE GIRL AND KNOWING THE SQUIRE'S QUEER WAYS
WHY DO YOU THINK SO ASKED HER MOTHER BECAUSE THE COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ARE BOTH FADING AWAY AND DYING JUST AS THE DINGLE BELLS DID AND PAPA SAID WHEN THEY FADED AND WITHERED HE AND THE BOYS WOULD COME BACK TO US
VERY AGREEABLE INDEED SHE REPLIED VAINLY ENDEAVOURING TO HIDE A GREAT YAWN I WISH SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DANCE SAID HIS WIFE I WISH WE COULD HAVE GOT A PARTNER FOR HER
A FLOWER GARDEN REPEATED HER MOTHER IN SURPRISE WHY DO YOU WISH A FLOWER GARDEN MARY I WANT TO PLANT IN IT THE COCKLE SHELLS AND THE COWSLIPS AND THE DINGLE BELLS SHE ANSWERED AND HER MOTHER
HERE ARE NO TEA THINGS FOR US YOU SEE NO MORE THERE ARE INDEED HOW VERY PROVOKING
THE DINGLE BELL I NOW MUST TELL I VE NAMED FOR BROTHER HOBART AND WHEN THE FLOWERS HAVE LIVED THEIR LIVES IN SUNSHINE AND IN RAIN AND THEN DO FADE WHY PAPA SAID
AND NOW AS THE DAYS PASSED BY MARY WATERED AND TENDED HER GARDEN WITH GREAT CARE AND WHEN THE FLOWERS BEGAN TO SPROUT SHE PLUCKED ALL THE WEEDS THAT GREW AMONG THEM AND SO IN THE MILD SPRING WEATHER THE PLANTS GREW FINELY
AND WHEN ALL THESE MATTERS WERE ARRANGED THE IMPORTANT EVENING CAME WHICH WAS TO USHER HER INTO THE UPPER ROOMS HER HAIR WAS CUT AND DRESSED BY THE BEST HAND HER CLOTHES PUT ON WITH CARE
SHE WAS FILLED WITH JOY WHEN ONE MORNING SHE RAN OUT TO HER FLOWER GARDEN AFTER BREAKFAST AND FOUND THE DINGLE BELLS AND COWSLIPS WERE ACTUALLY BLOSSOMING WHILE EVEN THE COCKLE SHELLS WERE SHOWING THEIR WHITE BUDS
CAUTIONS AGAINST THE VIOLENCE OF SUCH NOBLEMEN AND BARONETS AS DELIGHT IN FORCING YOUNG LADIES AWAY TO SOME REMOTE FARM HOUSE MUST AT SUCH A MOMENT RELIEVE THE FULNESS OF HER HEART WHO WOULD NOT THINK SO
AND DROWN HER IN TEARS FOR THE LAST DAY OR TWO OF THEIR BEING TOGETHER AND ADVICE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND APPLICABLE NATURE MUST OF COURSE FLOW FROM HER WISE LIPS IN THEIR PARTING CONFERENCE IN HER CLOSET
WERE ALL THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR HER BEING THE CHOICE OF A SENSIBLE INTELLIGENT MAN LIKE MISTER ALLEN IN ONE RESPECT SHE WAS ADMIRABLY FITTED TO INTRODUCE A YOUNG LADY INTO PUBLIC
IN ADDITION TO WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID OF CATHERINE MORLAND'S PERSONAL AND MENTAL ENDOWMENTS WHEN ABOUT TO BE LAUNCHED INTO ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS OF A SIX WEEKS RESIDENCE IN BATH
SHE NODDED AND SMILED TO HIM AND THE BIG BLUFF SQUIRE RODE UP TO HER SIDE AND LOOKED DOWN WITH A SMILE AT HER FLOWERS THEN HE SAID TO HER IN RHYME FOR IT WAS A WAY OF SPEAKING THE JOLLY SQUIRE HAD
HER FATHER INSTEAD OF GIVING HER AN UNLIMITED ORDER ON HIS BANKER OR EVEN PUTTING AN HUNDRED POUNDS BANK BILL INTO HER HANDS GAVE HER ONLY TEN GUINEAS AND PROMISED HER MORE WHEN SHE WANTED IT
ON HAVING PRESERVED HER GOWN FROM INJURY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SHOCKING TO HAVE IT TORN
AND HENCE MISS MORLAND HAD A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF ALL THE COMPANY BENEATH HER AND OF ALL THE DANGERS OF HER LATE PASSAGE THROUGH THEM IT WAS A SPLENDID SIGHT AND SHE BEGAN FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT EVENING
ASKED THE SQUIRE IN HIS KIND BLUFF VOICE AND MARY ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THE FLOWERS I MUCH ADMIRE YOU KNOW PAPA DID SAY HE WON'T BE HOME AGAIN SQUIRE TILL ALL HAVE PASSED AWAY
AND DO YOU KNOW THE DINGLE BELLS THAT GROW NEAR THE EDGE OF THE WOOD HE ASKED AGAIN I KNOW THEM WELL PAPA
FOR MY PART I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING I LIKE SO WELL IN THE WHOLE ROOM I ASSURE YOU HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS WHISPERED CATHERINE NOT TO HAVE A SINGLE ACQUAINTANCE HERE
AND NOT A GARDEN IN THE LAND CAN SHOW SO FAIR A SIGHT AND SO IT WAS FOR AS THEY RODE THROUGH THE PASTURES THE COWSLIPS BLOOMED ON EVERY HAND AND MARY'S EYES GREW BIGGER AND BIGGER AS SHE THOUGHT OF HER POOR GARDEN WITH ITS DEAD FLOWERS
PRAY TELL ME DEAR THOUGH MUCH I FEAR THE ANSWER SAD I KNOW HOW GROW THE STURDY COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW AND MARY LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH HER BRIGHT SMILE AND ANSWERED
MISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY HOW DOES YOUR GARDEN GROW WITH DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW HIGH UPON A CLIFF THAT OVERLOOKED THE SEA WAS A LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE
TO FEEL HERSELF AT A BALL SHE LONGED TO DANCE BUT SHE HAD NOT AN ACQUAINTANCE IN THE ROOM MISSUS ALLEN DID ALL THAT SHE COULD DO IN SUCH A CASE BY SAYING VERY PLACIDLY EVERY NOW AND THEN
SOMETHING IS SURELY THE MATTER WITH BROTHER HOBART THE DINGLE BELLS ARE DYING SAID HER MOTHER AFTER LOOKING CAREFULLY AT THE FLOWERS BUT THE REASON IS THAT THE COLD WINDS FROM THE SEA SWEPT RIGHT OVER YOUR GARDEN LAST NIGHT
SOMEBODY GAVE ME A PUSH THAT HAS HURT IT I AM AFRAID NO INDEED IT LOOKS VERY NICE BUT
I VERY MUCH SUSPECT THE REAL REASON THEY ARE DYING IS BECAUSE THE COLD SEA WIND CAUGHT THEM LAST NIGHT DINGLE BELLS ARE DELICATE IF YOU HAD SCATTERED THE COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ABOUT THEM THE STRONGER PLANTS WOULD HAVE PROTECTED THE WEAKER BUT YOU SEE MY GIRL
AND NOW WAS THE TIME FOR A HEROINE WHO HAD NOT YET PLAYED A VERY DISTINGUISHED PART IN THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING TO BE NOTICED AND ADMIRED EVERY FIVE MINUTES BY REMOVING SOME OF THE CROWD GAVE GREATER OPENINGS FOR HER CHARMS
BUT TELL ME PAPA WHAT HAVE THE FLOWERS TO DO WITH YOUR COMING HOME WHY JUST THIS SWEETHEART RETURNED THE SAILOR GRAVELY ALL THE TIME THAT IT TAKES THE COWSLIPS AND DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS TO SPROUT FROM THE GROUND
THEN GOD WILLING WE SHALL COME BACK TO YOU AND BY THAT TIME YOU MAY HAVE GROWN WISER AND BIGGER AND I AM SURE YOU WILL HAVE GROWN OLDER SO ONE MORE KISS SWEETHEART AND THEN WE MUST GO FOR OUR TIME IS UP
THAT THE READER MAY BE ABLE TO JUDGE IN WHAT MANNER HER ACTIONS WILL HEREAFTER TEND TO PROMOTE THE GENERAL DISTRESS OF THE WORK AND HOW SHE WILL PROBABLY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCE POOR CATHERINE TO ALL THE DESPERATE WRETCHEDNESS
HER CAUTIONS WERE CONFINED TO THE FOLLOWING POINTS I BEG CATHERINE
AND I THINK BECAUSE THE FLOWERS ARE STRONG AND HEARTY THAT YOU MAY KNOW YOUR FATHER AND BROTHERS ARE THE SAME
AND AFTER THAT SHE VISITED THE FIELDS EACH DAY AND WATCHED THE FLOWERS GROW AND IT WAS NOT SO VERY LONG AS THE SQUIRE SAID BEFORE THE BLOSSOMS BEGAN TO WITHER AND FALL AWAY AND FINALLY ONE DAY MARY LOOKED OUT OVER THE SEA
AND NOW MY PAPA'S COMING HOME FOR SO HE SURELY SAID AH SAID THE SQUIRE LOOKING AT HER CURIOUSLY I M AFRAID YOU ARE GETTING WAY AHEAD OF TIME SEE HERE MARY
WILL BE NATURALLY SUPPOSED TO BE MOST SEVERE A THOUSAND ALARMING PRESENTIMENTS OF EVIL TO HER BELOVED CATHERINE FROM THIS TERRIFIC SEPARATION MUST OPPRESS HER HEART WITH SADNESS
HOW OLD FASHIONED IT IS LOOK AT THE BACK AFTER SOME TIME THEY RECEIVED AN OFFER OF TEA FROM ONE OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS IT WAS THANKFULLY ACCEPTED AND THIS INTRODUCED A LIGHT CONVERSATION WITH THE GENTLEMAN WHO OFFERED IT
SAID MARY FOR THIS IS TO BE MY OWN LITTLE FLOWER GARDEN AND I WANT TO DO ALL THE WORK MYSELF NOW I MUST TELL YOU THAT THIS LITTLE GIRL ALTHOUGH VERY SWEET IN MANY WAYS HAD ONE SERIOUS FAULT
I DON'T UPON MY WORD I WISH I DID I WISH I HAD A LARGE ACQUAINTANCE HERE WITH ALL MY HEART AND THEN I SHOULD GET YOU A PARTNER
MISSUS ALLEN WAS ONE OF THAT NUMEROUS CLASS OF FEMALES WHOSE SOCIETY CAN RAISE NO OTHER EMOTION THAN SURPRISE AT THERE BEING ANY MEN IN THE WORLD WHO COULD LIKE THEM WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY THEM
SAID MARY BUT THIS MUCH I MAY TELL YOU
NO ACQUAINTANCE TO CLAIM NO GENTLEMAN TO ASSIST THEM THEY SAW NOTHING OF MISTER ALLEN AND AFTER LOOKING ABOUT THEM IN VAIN FOR A MORE ELIGIBLE SITUATION WERE OBLIGED TO SIT DOWN AT THE END OF A TABLE
AND YOU SHALL PLANT YOUR FLOWERS AND CARE FOR THEM YOURSELF I THINK I D RATHER HAVE THE FLOWERS AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE SAID MARY BUT WHY ENQUIRED HER MOTHER THEY WILL BE BETTER SHELTERED AT THE SIDE
REPLIED TO HIM LIKEWISE IN RHYME SAYING I THANK YOU SQUIRE THAT YOU ENQUIRE HOW WELL THE FLOWERS ARE GROWING THE DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ARE BLOWING
OF WHICH A LAST VOLUME IS CAPABLE WHETHER BY HER IMPRUDENCE VULGARITY OR JEALOUSY WHETHER BY INTERCEPTING HER LETTERS RUINING HER CHARACTER OR TURNING HER OUT OF DOORS
WHEN THEY HAVE GROWN UP BIG AND STRONG SAID MARY ONE MORNING AS SHE WEEDED THE BED AND WHEN THEY HAVE BUDDED AND BLOSSOMED AND FADED AWAY AGAIN THEN PAPA AND MY BROTHERS WILL COME HOME AND I SHALL CALL THE COCKLE SHELLS PAPA
THESE SAME ACTIVE BRAINS GOT HER INTO PERPETUAL SCRAPES SHE WAS FOND OF BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR
HERE ENDED THE EXTRACTS AND IT SEEMED AS IF ONLY A MINUTE HAD PASSED SINCE THEY STOPPED LAUGHING OVER THEM BEFORE THE LONG SHADOWS BEGAN TO FALL AND MARY CAME TO SAY THAT ALL OF THEM MUST COME IN TO GET READY FOR TEA
NOTICE YOUR ARM'S SORE INJECTIONS YOU'VE BEEN INSENSIBLE FOR NEARLY THIRTY HOURS I THOUGHT SLOWLY
LEST SOME HUNGRY COW SHOULD TAKE A FANCY TO THE ROSE BUSH AND EAT IT UP YES SAID KATY STROKING A LEAF WITH HER FINGER IT WAS IN GREAT DANGER ONE NIGHT LAST WINTER BUT IT ESCAPED
SHOES AND TROUSERS AND CLOTHES GENERALLY WERE AUNT IZZIE'S AFFAIR THEIRS WAS TO SLIDE AND ENJOY THEMSELVES CLOVER NEXT IN AGE TO KATY
AND ENCOURAGED CLIMBING AND ROUGH PLAYS IN SPITE OF THE BUMPS AND RAGGED CLOTHES WHICH RESULTED IN FACT THERE WAS JUST ONE HALF HOUR OF THE DAY WHEN AUNT IZZIE WAS REALLY SATISFIED ABOUT HER CHARGES AND THAT WAS THE HALF HOUR BEFORE BREAKFAST
IT WAS A HOT DAY THE SKY WAS VERY BLUE
THE YARDS OF THE HOUSES WERE ONLY SEPARATED BY A GREEN HEDGE WITH NO GATE SO THAT CECY SPENT TWO THIRDS OF HER TIME AT DOCTOR CARR'S
THE DELICATE WOMEN TO WHOM HE WAS INEXORABLY SEVERE
AND THE VOICE OF A HUMAN BEING TOGETHER THEN ANOTHER VOICE TELLING SOME HEAVEN FORSAKEN IDIOT TO DESIST YOU WERE NEARLY DEAD SAID MY INTERLOCUTOR
SO DARLINGS TAKE THIS LITTLE CHILDISH STORY
AND BATTER PUDDINGS NOT BOILED ONES YOU KNOW BUT LITTLE BAKED ONES WITH BROWN SHINY TOPS AND A GREAT DEAL OF PUDDING SAUCE TO EAT ON THEM
AND NEVER RUN AWAY AND HIDE AND THERE WON'T BE ANY POST OFFICES OR ANYTHING DISAGREEABLE WHAT'LL YOU BE JOHNNIE ASKED CLOVER ANXIOUS TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT FOR ELSIE'S VOICE WAS GROWING PLAINTIVE
ALL I'M GOING TO BE A BEAUTIFUL LADY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY IN THE WORLD AND I'M GOING TO LIVE IN A YELLOW CASTLE WITH YELLOW PILLARS TO THE PORTICO AND A SQUARE THING ON TOP LIKE MISTER SAWYER'S MY CHILDREN ARE GOING TO HAVE A PLAY HOUSE UP THERE
WHERE SAID I IT'S AN ISLAND WHERE I LIVE SO FAR AS I KNOW IT HASN'T GOT A NAME HE STARED AT ME WITH HIS NETHER LIP DROPPING AND LOOKED SO WILFULLY STUPID OF A SUDDEN
FORGIT WHAT DID GRIDEL CAKES FOR BREKFAST DEBBY DIDN'T FRY ENUFF
JUST AS THEY WERE READY THE SIDE DOOR BANGED AND KATY AND CECY HALL CAME INTO THE YARD I MUST TELL YOU ABOUT CECY SHE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF THE CHILDREN'S AND LIVED IN A HOUSE NEXT DOOR
YET HIS CRUELTY WAS NOT MORE ODIOUS THAN HIS MERCY OR PERHAPS IT MAY BE MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT HIS MERCY AND HIS CRUELTY WERE SUCH THAT EACH REFLECTS INFAMY ON THE OTHER OUR HORROR AT THE FATE OF THE SIMPLE CLOWNS THE YOUNG LADS
THEY WERE FOREVER ESTABLISHING IN ALL SORTS OF HIDDEN PLACES BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT ELSIE AND USED TO TELL HER TO RUN AWAY AND PLAY WITH THE CHILDREN WHICH HURT HER FEELINGS VERY MUCH WHEN SHE WOULDN'T RUN AWAY
THAN ONE DAY WHEN FIVE OUT OF THE SIX WERE PERCHED ON TOP OF THE ICE HOUSE LIKE CHICKENS ON A ROOST
WHEN KATE AND AUNT IZZIE WERE WILLING THEY HAD ONLY TO CLIMB A PAIR OF BARS VERY EASY ONES AND WITHOUT ANY FEAR OF AN ANGEL WITH FLAMING SWORD TO STOP THE WAY
BY AND BY JOHN AND DORRY TROTTED AWAY ON MYSTERIOUS ERRANDS OF THEIR OWN WASN'T DORRY FUNNY WITH HIS TURKEY REMARKED CECY AND THEY ALL LAUGHED AGAIN IF YOU WON'T TELL SAID KATY I'LL LET YOU SEE DORRY'S JOURNAL
THEY WERE FAIRLY IN THE FIELD AND WITH ONE CONSENT THEY ALL BEGAN TO RUN TILL THEY REACHED THE ENTRANCE OF THE WOOD THEN THEY HALTED WITH A QUEER LOOK OF HESITATION ON THEIR FACES
A LITTLE FAT MAN WITH A WAND IN HIS HAND POPPED OUT FROM BEHIND THE STUMP IT WAS SANTA CLAUS OF COURSE HE GAVE THE BULL SUCH A RAP WITH HIS WAND THAT HE MOO ED DREADFULLY AND THEN PUT UP HIS FORE PAW TO SEE IF HIS NOSE WAS ON OR NOT
AND FELT AS IF SHE WERE ALL LEGS AND ELBOWS AND ANGLES AND JOINTS HAPPILY HER HEAD WAS SO FULL OF OTHER THINGS OF PLANS AND SCHEMES AND FANCIES OF ALL SORTS THAT SHE DIDN'T OFTEN TAKE TIME TO REMEMBER HOW TALL SHE WAS
TO BE GUIDED IN SELECTING REBELS FOR PUNISHMENT IS PERFECTLY OBVIOUS THE RINGLEADERS THE MEN OF RANK FORTUNE AND EDUCATION WHOSE POWER AND WHOSE ARTIFICES HAVE LED THE MULTITUDE INTO ERROR ARE THE PROPER OBJECTS OF SEVERITY THE DELUDED POPULACE
HE HAD WRITTEN THAT DECLARATION WHICH FOR INSOLENCE MALIGNITY AND MENDACITY
CLOVER IS GOING TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY IN THE WORLD BUT I'LL BE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WHICH ALWAYS LOOKED READY TO LAUGH THESE TWO WERE GREAT FRIENDS THOUGH DORRY SEEMED LIKE A GIRL WHO HAD GOT INTO BOY'S CLOTHES BY MISTAKE AND JOHNNIE LIKE A BOY WHO IN A FIT OF FUN HAD BORROWED HIS SISTER'S FROCK
THE CHILDREN HADN'T ANY MAMMA SHE HAD DIED WHEN PHIL WAS A BABY FOUR YEARS BEFORE MY STORY BEGAN KATY COULD REMEMBER HER PRETTY WELL TO THE REST SHE WAS BUT A SAD SWEET NAME
EVEN BABY VOTES AND STAR EYED CHILDREN IN WHOSE INNOCENT FACES KINDLES THE GLADNESS WHICH WAS ONCE OUR OWN CROWD ROUND OUR KNEES WITH SWEET AND COAXING VOICES ASKING FOR STORIES OF THAT OLD TIME HOME
I MEAN TO HAVE JUST THE SAME CRIED ELSIE WHOSE IMAGINATION WAS FIRED BY THIS GORGEOUS VISION ONLY MY POND WILL BE THE BIGGEST I SHALL BE A GREAT DEAL BEAUTIFULLER TOO SHE ADDED YOU CAN'T SAID KATY FROM OVERHEAD
AND THERE WERE SPOTS OF BLOOD ON THE GUNWALE AT THE SAME TIME MY EYE CAUGHT MY HAND SO THIN THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A DIRTY SKIN PURSE FULL OF LOOSE BONES AND ALL THE BUSINESS OF THE BOAT CAME BACK TO ME
AND AS WITH CARELESS HANDS YOU TURN THE PAGES
AND A BLISSFUL STICKINESS PERVADED THE PARTY
SHE WAS A NEAT DAPPER PINK AND WHITE GIRL MODEST AND PRIM IN MANNER WITH LIGHT SHINY HAIR WHICH ALWAYS KEPT SMOOTH AND SLIM HANDS WHICH NEVER LOOKED DIRTY
THE RANK WHICH HE HAD INHERITED IN THE STATE AND THE HIGH COMMAND WHICH HE HAD BORNE IN THE REBEL ARMY
AND OPENING HIS BIG MOUTH
BECAUSE THE TREES AND BUSHES GREW SO CLOSELY THAT YOU COULD NOT SEE JUST WHERE IT ENDED IN WINTER THE GROUND WAS DAMP AND BOGGY SO THAT NOBODY WENT THERE
THERE WAS A NOISE IN THE FOREST AND A DREADFUL BLACK BULL WITH FIERY EYES GALLOPED UP
I MEAN TO HAVE A BLACK SILK DRESS AND PINK ROSES IN MY BONNET AND A WHITE MUSLIN LONG SHAWL SAID CECY AND I MEAN TO LOOK EXACTLY LIKE MINERVA CLARK I SHALL BE VERY GOOD TOO
WE WANT TO GO BY SASSAFRAS PATH CRIED JOHN AND DORRY HOWEVER KATY AS USUAL HAD HER WAY IT WAS AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD FIRST TRY PILGRIM'S PATH AND AFTERWARD MAKE A THOROUGH EXPLORATION OF THE WHOLE OF THEIR LITTLE KINGDOM
HE MUST HAVE SEEN THE QUESTION IN MY FACE FOR MY VOICE WAS INACCESSIBLE TO ME YOU WERE PICKED UP IN A BOAT STARVING THE NAME ON THE BOAT WAS THE LADY VAIN
AND SAY TO EACH OTHER WHAT A SIGHT OF WASHING THOSE CHILDREN MADE
I'M A PASSENGER MYSELF FROM ARICA
THEN SANTA CLAUS WAKED UP THE FAIRY AND TOLD HER THAT IF SHE DIDN'T TAKE BETTER CARE OF ROSY POSY HE SHOULD PUT SOME OTHER FAIRY INTO HER PLACE AND SET HER TO KEEP GUARD OVER A PRICKLY SCRATCHY BLACKBERRY BUSH
WHAT SHE DID TO MAKE HERSELF GROW SO NOBODY COULD TELL BUT THERE SHE WAS UP ABOVE PAPA'S EAR AND HALF A HEAD TALLER THAN POOR AUNT IZZIE WHENEVER SHE STOPPED TO THINK ABOUT HER HEIGHT SHE BECAME VERY AWKWARD
GETTING UP IN A GREAT PET BUT CLOVER WHO WAS A BORN PEACEMAKER CAUGHT HOLD OF HIS ARM
HE HAD INSTIGATED MONMOUTH FIRST TO INVADE THE KINGDOM AND THEN TO USURP THE CROWN IT WAS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT A STRICT SEARCH WOULD BE MADE FOR THE ARCHTRAITOR AS HE WAS OFTEN CALLED
THEN THE NOISE OVERHEAD BEGAN AGAIN
IT MAY BE DISTINCTLY TRACED IN EVERY CASE EITHER TO A SORDID OR TO A MALIGNANT MOTIVE EITHER TO THIRST FOR MONEY OR TO THIRST FOR BLOOD IN THE CASE OF GREY THERE WAS NO MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE HIS PARTS AND KNOWLEDGE
WHICH I TOLD IN CONCISE SENTENCES ENOUGH FOR I FELT HORRIBLY WEAK AND WHEN IT WAS FINISHED HE REVERTED AT ONCE TO THE TOPIC OF NATURAL HISTORY AND HIS OWN BIOLOGICAL STUDIES HE BEGAN TO QUESTION ME CLOSELY ABOUT TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD AND GOWER STREET
I CALLED AFTER HIM BUT THE DOOR HAD CLOSED HE CAME BACK AGAIN WITH THE BOILED MUTTON AND I WAS SO EXCITED BY THE APPETISING SMELL OF IT THAT I FORGOT THE NOISE OF THE BEAST THAT HAD TROUBLED ME AFTER A DAY OF ALTERNATE SLEEP AND FEEDING
AND THEN YOU COULD ALL COME AND LIVE WITH ME AND WE WOULD PLAY IN THE GARDEN AND DORRY SHOULD HAVE TURKEY FIVE TIMES A DAY IF HE LIKED AND WE'D HAVE A MACHINE TO DARN THE STOCKINGS AND ANOTHER MACHINE TO PUT THE BUREAU DRAWERS IN ORDER
I THINK THEY MUST HAVE REPEATED THEM AT LEAST A HUNDRED TIMES I GOT UP FROM MY SEAT TO SEE IF I COULD FIND THE SPEAKERS AND SURE ENOUGH THERE ON ONE OF THE CAT TAIL BULRUSHES I SPIED TWO TINY PALE GREEN CREATURES
WHICH WERE TIED TO THE VERY POPLAR TREE
AS IF TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE EATEN I DON'T KNOW REPLIED KATY DREAMILY SHE HAD LEFT HER SEAT
BUT JOHNNIE HAD NO CLEAR IDEAS AS TO HER FUTURE SHE LAUGHED A GREAT DEAL AND SQUEEZED DORRY'S ARM VERY TIGHT BUT THAT WAS ALL DORRY WAS MORE EXPLICIT I MEAN TO HAVE TURKEY EVERY DAY HE DECLARED
CLOVER HELD FAST AND WOULD NOT LET GO DOCTOR CARR WHO WASN'T ATTENDING PARTICULARLY HEARD NOTHING BUT THE PATHETIC TONE OF CLOVER'S VOICE AS SHE SAID
LITTLE PHIL THE YOUNGEST WAS FOUR AND THE REST FITTED IN BETWEEN DOCTOR CARR THEIR PAPA WAS A DEAR KIND BUSY MAN WHO WAS AWAY FROM HOME ALL DAY AND SOMETIMES ALL NIGHT TOO
WERE SEVEN LITTLE PIES MOLASSES PIES BAKED IN SAUCERS EACH WITH A BROWN TOP AND CRISP CANDIFIED EDGE
WHEREAS KATY TORE HER DRESS EVERY DAY HATED SEWING AND DIDN'T CARE A BUTTON ABOUT BEING CALLED GOOD WHILE CLOVER AND ELSIE SHIED OFF LIKE RESTLESS PONIES WHEN ANY ONE TRIED TO PAT THEIR HEADS IT WAS VERY PERPLEXING TO AUNT IZZIE
LEFT IT ALL HE SAID TEN YEARS AGO HOW JOLLY IT ALL USED TO BE BUT I MADE A YOUNG ASS OF MYSELF
HE KEPT IT ONCE FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS AND THEN GAVE IT UP I FOUND THE BOOK THIS MORNING IN THE NURSERY CLOSET ALL OF THEM PROMISED AND KATY PRODUCED IT FROM HER POCKET IT BEGAN THUS
I SAY BY THE PILGRIM'S PATH AND THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY SO DO I CHIMED IN CLOVER WHO ALWAYS AGREED WITH KATY THE PATH OF PEACE IS NICE SUGGESTED CECY NO NO
BRINGING UP THE REAR OH THERE IS THE DEAR ROSARY ALL SAFE CRIED THE CHILDREN AS THEY REACHED THE TOP OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY AND CAME UPON A TALL STUMP
PA SAID SO THE PATH OF PEACE GOT ITS NAME BECAUSE OF ITS DARKNESS AND COOLNESS HIGH BUSHES ALMOST MET OVER IT AND TREES KEPT IT SHADY EVEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY A SORT OF WHITE FLOWER GREW THERE
HURRY UP CLOVER AND GET THE THINGS CECY AND I WILL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE THE CHILDREN JUMPED UP GLADLY AND SLID DOWN THE ROOF CLOVER FETCHED A COUPLE OF BASKETS FROM THE WOOD SHED ELSIE RAN FOR HER KITTEN
EVERYBODY LOVED HER AND SHE LOVED EVERYBODY ESPECIALLY KATY WHOM SHE LOOKED UP TO AS ONE OF THE WISEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD PRETTY LITTLE PHIL SAT NEXT ON THE ROOF TO CLOVER AND SHE HELD HIM TIGHT WITH HER ARM
I DARESAY IT'S ALL DIFFERENT NOW BUT I MUST LOOK UP THAT ASS OF A COOK AND SEE WHAT HE'S DONE TO YOUR MUTTON THE GROWLING OVERHEAD WAS RENEWED SO SUDDENLY AND WITH SO MUCH SAVAGE ANGER THAT IT STARTLED ME WHAT'S THAT
OR PERHAPS ON THE VERY TOP STEP OF THE SCUTTLE LADDER SHE SPIED THE LITTLE PAPER BOX WITH ITS LOAD OF NOTES ALL ENDING WITH BE SURE AND NOT LET ELSIE KNOW THEN SHE WOULD SEIZE THE BOX AND MARCHING UP TO WHEREVER THE OTHERS WERE
AS I WALKED HOME I FELL TO THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER KATY A KATY I ONCE KNEW
WHEN ONCE THE SLAUGHTER ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE IS OVER CAN SCARCELY BE TREATED TOO LENIENTLY THIS RULE SO EVIDENTLY AGREEABLE TO JUSTICE AND HUMANITY WAS NOT ONLY NOT OBSERVED IT WAS INVERTED
YOU KNOW THE KIND OF MAN CALLS THE THING THE
OR TO SING FOR I COULDN'T TELL EXACTLY WHICH IT WAS ONE VOICE WAS SHRILL THE OTHER WHICH WAS A LITTLE DEEPER SOUNDED VERY POSITIVE AND CROSS THEY WERE EVIDENTLY DISPUTING ABOUT SOMETHING
THE LITTLE ONES KEPT HOPING SHE MIGHT RETURN AUNT IZZIE WAS A SMALL WOMAN SHARP FACED AND THIN RATHER OLD LOOKING AND VERY NEAT AND PARTICULAR ABOUT EVERYTHING SHE MEANT TO BE KIND TO THE CHILDREN BUT THEY PUZZLED HER MUCH
LIKE CECY BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BUT EVERY SUNDAY I'LL GO AND STAND BY THE GATE AND WHEN HER SCHOLARS GO BY ON THEIR WAY HOME
ONLY A GREAT DEAL PRETTIER ALL THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN WILL WANT ME TO GO AND RIDE BUT I SHAN'T NOTICE THEM AT ALL BECAUSE YOU KNOW I SHALL ALWAYS BE TEACHING IN SUNDAY SCHOOL AND VISITING THE POOR AND SOME DAY
HAVE SOME OF THIS SAID HE AND GAVE ME A DOSE OF SOME SCARLET STUFF ICED IT TASTED LIKE BLOOD AND MADE ME FEEL STRONGER YOU WERE IN LUCK SAID HE
I AM SORRY TO SAY THEY RAN AWAY FROM HER WHICH AS THEIR LEGS WERE LONGEST IT WAS EASY TO DO
AS ANY FOREST OF FAIRY LAND THE WAY TO PARADISE WAS THROUGH SOME WOODEN BARS KATY AND CECY CLIMBED THESE WITH A HOP SKIP AND JUMP WHILE THE SMALLER ONES SCRAMBLED UNDERNEATH ONCE PAST THE BARS
WHICH WERE HER GREATEST GRIEVANCE HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AND QUICK AS A BIRD'S SHE WOULD PEEP AND PEER AND FOLLOW AND WATCH TILL AT LAST IN SOME ODD UNLIKELY PLACE THE CROTCH OF A TREE
HE HAD WATERY GREY EYES ODDLY VOID OF EXPRESSION THEN JUST OVERHEAD
THERE WERE ALWAYS SO MANY DELIGHTFUL SCHEMES RIOTING IN HER BRAINS
THE WINDOW ABOVE OPENED A GLAD SHRIEK WAS HEARD AND KATY'S HEAD APPEARED
AS IF TO SEE ITS OWN BEAUTIFUL FACE IN THE WATER BUT THE CARDINAL DID NOT SEEM TO BE VAIN THE PICTURE WAS SO PRETTY THAT I SAT A LONG TIME ENJOYING IT SUDDENLY CLOSE TO ME TWO SMALL VOICES BEGAN TO TALK
SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO BELONG EXACTLY TO EITHER THE OLDER OR THE YOUNGER CHILDREN THE GREAT DESIRE AND AMBITION OF HER HEART
SO IN THEY MARCHED KATY AND CECY HEADING THE PROCESSION
SO THEY MADE HASTE TO BUILD THE BOWER IT DID NOT TAKE LONG
FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER THE LONG WINTER WHO KNEW WHAT THE FAIRIES MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE SINCE ANY OF THEM HAD BEEN THERE TO SEE WHICH PATH SHALL WE GO IN BY ASKED CLOVER AT LAST SUPPOSE WE VOTE SAID KATY
THEY WERE WHAT SHE CALLED NOT FIT TO BE SEEN THE NEIGHBORS PITIED HER VERY MUCH
THAT HE FINALLY SAID HE WOULD STAY ESPECIALLY AS THE OTHERS WERE QUITE GRAVE NOW AND PROMISED THAT THEY WOULDN'T LAUGH ANY MORE
THREE HELPS IS QUITE ENOUGH FOR A LITTLE BOY OH DORRY YOU PIG CRIED KATY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED WITH LAUGHTER DORRY WAS MUCH AFFRONTED I SHALL JUST GO AND TELL AUNT IZZIE WHAT YOU CALLED ME HE SAID
WHO DON'T MIND GETTING THEIR FEET WET BUT IN SUMMER THE WATER DRIED AWAY AND THEN IT WAS ALL FRESH AND GREEN AND FULL OF DELIGHTFUL THINGS WILD ROSES AND SASSAFRAS AND BIRDS NESTS
ALWAYS NEVER AUNTY BOYS AND GIRLS WILL KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE LITTLE CARRS AND I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD EVER HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
SHE WAS A DEAR LOVING CHILD FOR ALL HER CARELESS HABITS AND MADE BUSHELS OF GOOD RESOLUTIONS EVERY WEEK OF HER LIFE ONLY UNLUCKILY SHE NEVER KEPT ANY OF THEM SHE HAD FITS OF RESPONSIBILITY ABOUT THE OTHER CHILDREN
AND OF USE NEVER SAW AS SHE DRIFTED ON HER HEEDLESS WAY THAT HERE IN THIS LONELY LITTLE SISTER WAS THE VERY CHANCE SHE WANTED FOR BEING A COMFORT TO SOMEBODY WHO NEEDED COMFORT VERY MUCH SHE NEVER SAW IT
PEOPLE VERY OFTEN SAY AFTERWARD THAT THEY ALWAYS KNEW CONCLUDED KATY SAGACIOUSLY OH KATY HOW BEAUTIFUL IT WILL BE SAID CLOVER CLASPING HER HANDS CLOVER BELIEVED IN KATY AS SHE DID IN THE BIBLE
LEFT BEHIND WOULD CRY BITTER TEARS AND AS SHE WAS TOO PROUD TO PLAY MUCH WITH DORRY AND JOHN HER PRINCIPAL COMFORT WAS TRACKING THE OLDER ONES ABOUT AND DISCOVERING THEIR MYSTERIES ESPECIALLY THE POST OFFICES
IT WAS A VERY NEAR THING INDEED
WAVED A WILD ROSE BUSH BUDDED OVER WITH FRESH GREEN EAVES THIS ROSARY WAS A FASCINATING THING TO THEIR MINDS THEY WERE ALWAYS INVENTING STORIES ABOUT IT AND WERE IN CONSTANT TERROR
CAME IN AGAIN AS I STOOD THERE AND I ASKED HIM FOR SOME CLOTHES HE LENT ME SOME DUCK THINGS OF HIS OWN FOR THOSE I HAD WORN IN THE BOAT HAD BEEN THROWN OVERBOARD THEY WERE RATHER LOOSE FOR ME FOR HE WAS LARGE AND LONG IN HIS LIMBS
IT WAS ONLY A LOW ROOF SET OVER A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND AS IT STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDE YARD IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO THE CHILDREN THAT THE SHORTEST ROAD TO EVERY PLACE WAS UP ONE OF ITS SLOPES AND DOWN THE OTHER
SHE WAS AS HEEDLESS AND INNOCENT AS A CHILD OF SIX
HE TOLD ME CASUALLY THAT THE CAPTAIN WAS THREE PARTS DRUNK IN HIS OWN CABIN AS I ASSUMED THE CLOTHES
THIS LITTLE STORY GREW IN MY HEAD AND I RESOLVED TO WRITE IT DOWN FOR YOU I HAVE DONE IT AND IN MEMORY OF MY TWO LITTLE FRIENDS ON THE BULRUSH I GIVE IT THEIR NAME HERE IT IS THE STORY OF WHAT KATY DID
AND HE COULD FORFEIT NO MORE INTEREST THAN HE HAD IF HE DIED HIS LANDS AT ONCE DEVOLVED ON THE NEXT HEIR IF HE WERE PARDONED
BUT MOTHER ALWAYS KISSED AND MADE THEM WELL IS IT LONG SINCE IT SEEMS A MOMENT ONLY YET HERE WE ARE IN BONNETS AND TAIL COATS GRAVE MEN OF BUSINESS MEMBERS OF COMMITTEES OUR PLAY TIME ENDED
RABBIT HOLLOW AND THE REST THE SUN WAS JUST OVER THEIR HEADS AND IT WAS NOON I'M GETTING HUNGRY SAID DORRY OH NO DORRY YOU MUSTN'T BE HUNGRY TILL THE BOWER IS READY CRIED THE LITTLE GIRLS ALARMED FOR DORRY WAS APT TO BE DISCONSOLATE
THERE'S YOUR OLD POST OFFICE BUT FEELING ALL THE TIME JUST LIKE CRYING POOR LITTLE ELSIE IN ALMOST EVERY BIG FAMILY THERE IS ONE OF THESE UNMATED LEFT OUT CHILDREN KATY
IT WAS DREADFUL TO HAVE TO PICK UP THE EMPTY BASKETS AND GO HOME FEELING THAT THE LONG DELIGHTFUL SATURDAY WAS OVER AND THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANOTHER FOR A WEEK BUT IT WAS COMFORTING TO REMEMBER THAT PARADISE WAS ALWAYS THERE AND THAT AT ANY MOMENT
SHE WAS A FAIR SWEET DUMPLING OF A GIRL WITH THICK PIG TAILS OF LIGHT BROWN HAIR AND SHORT SIGHTED BLUE EYES WHICH SEEMED TO HOLD TEARS JUST READY TO FALL FROM UNDER THE BLUE REALLY CLOVER WAS THE JOLLIEST LITTLE THING IN THE WORLD
FOR THEY SAID THE SAME WORDS OVER AND OVER AGAIN THESE WERE THE WORDS KATY DID KATY DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T DID DIDN'T
AM I ELIGIBLE FOR SOLID FOOD I ASKED THANKS TO ME HE SAID
AND THE LOW ANGRY GROWLING OF SOME LARGE ANIMAL AT THE SAME TIME THE MAN SPOKE HE REPEATED HIS QUESTION
THEY SAY ASTONISHED DID YOU TOO PLAY
AUNT IZZIE HAD PUT UP LUNCHES FOR PARADISE BEFORE YOU SEE AND KNEW PRETTY WELL WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE WAY OF APPETITE OH HOW GOOD EVERYTHING TASTED IN THAT BOWER WITH THE FRESH WIND RUSTLING THE POPLAR LEAVES SUNSHINE AND SWEET WOOD SMELLS ABOUT THEM
IT SHALL BE SOMETHING AND WHEN AUNT IZZIE SEES IT AND READS ABOUT ME IN THE NEWSPAPERS SHE WILL SAY THE DEAR CHILD
TWO RED ONES A YELLOW ONE WITH SHARP HORNS TIPPED WITH TIN AND A DEAR LITTLE WHITE ONE NAMED DAISY THERE WERE SIX OF THE CARR CHILDREN FOUR GIRLS AND TWO BOYS KATY THE OLDEST WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD
HAD ROST BEFE FOR DINER AND CABAGE AND POTATO AND APPEL SAWSE AND RICE PUDING I DO NOT LIKE RICE PUDING WHEN IT IS LIKE OURS
WHICH HUNG ALMOST OVER THE CHILDREN'S HEADS LET'S PLAY WE'RE GROWN UP SAID CECY AND TELL WHAT WE MEAN TO DO WELL SAID CLOVER YOU BEGIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO
AND RAGED FIERCELY AGAINST HIS INNOCENT PROGENY
IN PLACE OF THIS MAMMA WHOM THEY RECOLLECTED SO DIMLY THERE WAS AUNT IZZIE PAPA'S SISTER WHO CAME TO TAKE CARE OF THEM WHEN MAMMA WENT AWAY ON THAT LONG JOURNEY FROM WHICH FOR SO MANY MONTHS
I DON'T BELIEVE THE NEWSPAPERS WOULD BE SO SILLY AS TO PRINT THINGS ABOUT YOU KATY CARR PUT IN ELSIE VINDICTIVELY YES THEY WILL SAID CLOVER AND GAVE ELSIE A PUSH
THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING SO LONG AS I WAS THERE BUT THE MOMENT MY BACK WAS TURNED THEY BEGAN TO QUARREL AGAIN AND IN THE SAME OLD WORDS KATY DID KATY DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T
AND WE'D NEVER SEW OR KNIT GARTERS OR DO ANYTHING WE DIDN'T WANT TO THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO BE
AND ELSIE'S HEAVY HEART WENT UNCHEERED DORRY AND JOANNA SAT ON THE TWO ENDS OF THE RIDGE POLE DORRY WAS SIX YEARS OLD A PALE PUDGY BOY WITH RATHER A SOLEMN FACE
IT WAS CHRISTMAS EVE CONTINUED KATY IN A MYSTERIOUS TONE THE FAIRY OF THE ROSARY WAS QUITE SICK SHE HAD TAKEN A DREADFUL COLD IN HER HEAD AND THE POPLAR TREE FAIRY JUST OVER THERE
POOR KATY ALWAYS SAID WHEN I'M GROWN UP FORGETTING HOW VERY MUCH SHE HAD GROWN ALREADY PERHAPS SHE WENT ON IT WILL BE ROWING OUT IN BOATS AND SAVING PEOPLES LIVES LIKE THAT GIRL IN THE BOOK
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT A BIT LIKE HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD AUNT IZZIE HAD BEEN A GENTLE TIDY LITTLE THING WHO LOVED TO SIT AS CURLY LOCKS DID SEWING LONG SEAMS IN THE PARLOR AND TO HAVE HER HEAD PATTED BY OLDER PEOPLE AND BE TOLD THAT SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL
YES I SAID WITH ASSURANCE I COULD EAT SOME MUTTON BUT SAID HE WITH A MOMENTARY HESITATION YOU KNOW I'M DYING TO HEAR OF HOW YOU CAME TO BE ALONE IN THAT BOAT DAMN THAT HOWLING
SAID CECY TELL US WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP I'M NOT SURE ABOUT WHAT I'LL BE REPLIED KATY FROM OVERHEAD BEAUTIFUL OF COURSE AND GOOD IF I CAN ONLY NOT SO GOOD AS YOU CECY
WHEN IT WAS DONE THEY ALL CUDDLED IN UNDERNEATH IT WAS A VERY SMALL BOWER JUST BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD THEM AND THE BASKETS AND THE KITTEN I DON'T THINK THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ROOM FOR ANYBODY ELSE NOT EVEN ANOTHER KITTEN KATY
KATY'S NAME WAS KATY CARR SHE LIVED IN THE TOWN OF BURNET WHICH WASN'T A VERY BIG TOWN
THE MATTER SOUNDED AS THOUGH IT ENDED IN BLOWS BUT IN THAT I THOUGHT MY EARS WERE MISTAKEN THEN HE SHOUTED AT THE DOGS AND RETURNED TO THE CABIN WELL SAID HE IN THE DOORWAY YOU WERE JUST BEGINNING TO TELL ME
BUT I FOR REASONS WHICH I DO NOT CARE TO SPEAK OF NOW I DON'T WISH DOCTOR CHILTON CALLED IN ON ON THIS CASE AND BELIEVE ME HE CAN NOT KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT ABOUT YOUR TROUBLE AS THIS GREAT DOCTOR DOES
IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT JIMMY SAID MUCH OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PAST LIFE OF HIS BEFORE SHE HAD KNOWN HIM AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SHE PROMPTED POLLYANNA HAD FOR THE MOMENT FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT OF THE CONTROVERSY
IN STARTING ON A ROUND OF FLY AWAY MINUTE CALLS ON ALL HER OLD FRIENDS INDEED FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS ACCORDING TO NANCY THERE WASN'T NO PUTTING OF YOUR FINGER ON HER ANYWHERES
SO GILBERT DIDN'T GO BACK ON YOU AFTER ALL SAID MISSUS HARMON ANDREWS CONTRIVING TO CONVEY AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE IN HER TONE
MARILLA FELT THAT IN SOME STRANGE WAY HIS MARRIAGE WITH ANNE WOULD PUT RIGHT THAT OLD MISTAKE GOOD HAD COME OUT OF THE EVIL OF THE ANCIENT BITTERNESS AS FOR ANNE HERSELF SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE ALMOST FELT FRIGHTENED
AND HAVE MORE THINGS TO EAT AND WEAR THAN THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH NOW IF THOSE FOLKS ONLY KNEW THE OTHER FOLKS BUT MISTER PENDLETON INTERRUPTED WITH A LAUGH MY DEAR CHILD DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
CAUSE THERE WA'N'T NO ONE ELSE SHE COULD PLAY IT WITH THOUGH SHE DID SPEAK OF HER AUNT MISS POLLY NANCY CHUCKLED I GUESS YOU HAIN'T GOT SUCH AN AWFUL DIFF'RENT OPINION O THE MISTRESS THAN I HAVE SHE BRIDLED
GILBERT LOOKS VERY YOUNG FOR A DOCTOR I'M AFRAID PEOPLE WON'T HAVE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM SAID MISSUS JASPER BELL GLOOMILY THEN SHE SHUT HER MOUTH TIGHTLY AS IF SHE HAD SAID WHAT SHE CONSIDERED IT HER DUTY TO SAY AND HELD HER CONSCIENCE CLEAR
THAT WOULD BE EXPECTING TOO MUCH BUT THERE IS A BROOK AND IT ACTUALLY CUTS ACROSS ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN THEN SAID ANNE WITH A LONG SIGH OF SUPREME SATISFACTION
THERE WAS MORE EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR OF GREEN GABLES THAN THERE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE IN ALL ITS HISTORY EVEN MARILLA WAS SO EXCITED THAT SHE COULDN'T HELP SHOWING IT WHICH WAS LITTLE SHORT OF BEING PHENOMENAL
BUT THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO LACK OF JOYFUL GREETINGS ON THE PART OF EVERYBODY FROM THE MOMENT SHE STEPPED FROM THE RAILWAY TRAIN WITH HER AUNT POLLY AND DOCTOR CHILTON NOR DID POLLYANNA LOSE ANY TIME
I WONDER WHAT HIS FATE WAS WELL IT WAS A FORTUNATE MISTAKE SAID MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE THOUGH MIND YOU THERE WAS A TIME I DIDN'T THINK SO THAT EVENING I CAME UP TO SEE ANNE AND SHE TREATED US TO SUCH A SCENE
SHE WA'N'T THERE AND ALWAYS EVERYWHERE SHE WENT POLLYANNA MET THE QUESTION WELL HOW DID YOU LIKE BOSTON PERHAPS TO NO ONE DID SHE ANSWER THIS MORE FULLY THAN SHE DID TO MISTER PENDLETON
AND I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE CUT DOWN AND THIS LAST SPRING THEY WERE WHITE AND SUCH A CROP OF PLUMS I NEVER REMEMBER AT GREEN GABLES
AND ONE DAY FATHER HEARD HER HE GOT AWFUL MAD SO MAD THAT I REMEMBERED IT ALWAYS WHAT HE SAID HE SAID JAMIE WASN'T NO SORT OF A NAME FOR A BOY
JANE WAS NOT BRILLIANT AND HAD PROBABLY NEVER MADE A REMARK WORTH LISTENING TO IN HER LIFE BUT SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING THAT WOULD HURT ANYONE'S FEELINGS WHICH MAY BE A NEGATIVE TALENT BUT IS LIKEWISE A RARE AND ENVIABLE ONE
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED FOLKS COMMENTED THE MAN I DO POLLYANNA FROWNED AGAIN AND PONDERED BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF SUCH A LOT OF THEM IF YOU DON'T KNOW EM AND MISSUS CAREW WOULDN'T LET ME
THE NURSE ENTERED THE ROOM AT THAT MOMENT AND AUNT POLLY ROSE TO HER FEET ABRUPTLY A LOOK OF RELIEF ON HER FACE I AM VERY SORRY POLLYANNA SHE SAID A LITTLE STIFFLY
HE WAS RICH TO BE SURE AND GILBERT IS POOR AT LEAST TO BEGIN WITH BUT THEN HE'S AN ISLAND BOY HE'S GILBERT BLYTHE SAID MARILLA CONTENTEDLY MARILLA WOULD HAVE DIED THE DEATH BEFORE SHE WOULD HAVE
SHE'S SENT TIMOTHY DOWN TER COBB'S GREENHOUSE THREE TIMES FOR FRESH FLOWERS AN THAT BESIDES ALL THE POSIES FETCHED IN TER HER TOO AN THE OTHER DAY IF I DIDN'T FIND HER SITTIN
RED HAIR IS VERY FASHIONABLE NOW SAID ANNE TRYING TO SMILE BUT SPEAKING RATHER COLDLY LIFE HAD DEVELOPED IN HER A SENSE OF HUMOR WHICH HELPED HER OVER MANY DIFFICULTIES
CAME WITH HER MOTHER AND MISSUS JASPER BELL BUT IN JANE THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS HAD NOT BEEN CURDLED BY YEARS OF MATRIMONIAL BICKERINGS HER LINES HAD FALLEN IN PLEASANT PLACES IN SPITE OF THE FACT AS MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WOULD SAY
I'M NOT JIMMY BEAN I'M JIMMY PENDLETON AND I MEAN THAT I SHOULD THINK FROM YOUR TALK THAT THERE WASN'T ANYBODY DOWN TO BOSTON BUT JUST THAT LOONY BOY WHO CALLS THEM BIRDS AND SQUIRRELS LADY LANCELOT
WHO WILL COME FROM NEW YORK TO MORROW POLLYANNA STILL LOOKED UNCONVINCED BUT AUNT POLLY IF YOU LOVED DOCTOR CHILTON WHAT POLLYANNA AUNT POLLY'S VOICE WAS VERY SHARP NOW
AS WAS USUALLY THE CASE WHEN THIS QUESTION WAS PUT TO HER SHE BEGAN HER REPLY WITH A TROUBLED FROWN OH I LIKED IT I JUST LOVED IT SOME OF IT BUT NOT ALL OF IT SMILED MISTER PENDLETON
WHO OWNS THE HOUSE WELL IT'S THE PROPERTY OF THE GLEN SAINT MARY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH NOW AND I RENTED IT FROM THE TRUSTEES BUT IT BELONGED UNTIL LATELY TO A VERY OLD LADY MISS ELIZABETH RUSSELL
AS HE TURNED LOFTILY AWAY LEAVING A DISTRESSED BEWILDERED POLLYANNA BEHIND HIM WELL ANYWAY I CAN BE GLAD HE DOESN'T ALWAYS ACT LIKE THIS SIGHED THE LITTLE GIRL
THIS TIME BELDINGSVILLE DID NOT LITERALLY WELCOME POLLYANNA HOME WITH BRASS BANDS AND BUNTING PERHAPS BECAUSE THE HOUR OF HER EXPECTED ARRIVAL WAS KNOWN TO BUT FEW OF THE TOWNSPEOPLE
HE IS A VERY NICE BOY AND HE KNOWS A LOT BOOKS AND STORIES WHY HE CAN MAKE STORIES RIGHT OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD BESIDES IT ISN'T LADY LANCELOT IT'S SIR LANCELOT
WITH HIS EYES TURNED AWAY YET THERE WAS A CURIOUS SOFTNESS IN HIS VOICE THAT WAS ALWAYS NOTICEABLE WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF HIS FATHER YOU YES TWAS JUST A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE HE DIED
DOCTOR CHILTON OH AUNT POLLY I'D SO LOVE TO HAVE DOCTOR CHILTON I'VE WANTED HIM ALL THE TIME BUT I WAS AFRAID YOU DIDN'T ON ACCOUNT OF HIS SEEING YOU IN THE SUN PARLOR THAT DAY YOU KNOW SO I DIDN'T LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING BUT
WELL FASHION OR NO FASHION I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING PRETTIER FOR A SPARE ROOM BED THAN A NICE APPLE LEAF SPREAD THAT'S WHAT I MUST SEE ABOUT GETTING THEM BLEACHED I'VE HAD THEM SEWED UP IN COTTON BAGS EVER SINCE THOMAS DIED
OLD TOM STIFFENED I WAS ONLY THINKIN TWOULD BE SOME OF A SURPRISE TO HER HE EXPLAINED WITH DIGNITY
AND RETURNED INNUMERABLE CHEERY ANSWERS TO THE MANY MESSAGES OF LOVE AND INQUIRY THAT WERE BROUGHT TO HER BEDSIDE BUT SHE TOO GREW PALE AND THIN AND THE NERVOUS ACTIVITY OF THE POOR LITTLE HANDS AND ARMS
I CAN'T REALIZE THAT SHE'S GROWN UP I SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT I FELT WHEN I SAW MATTHEW BRINGING IN A GIRL
GRINNED OLD TOM THEN ABRUPTLY THE LIGHT DIED FROM HIS EYES HOW IS SHE TER DAY THE LITTLE GAL NANCY SHOOK HER HEAD HER FACE TOO HAD SOBERED JUST THE SAME MISTER TOM
PUT INTO WORDS THE THOUGHT THAT WAS ALWAYS IN THE BACKGROUND OF HER MIND WHENEVER SHE HAD LOOKED AT GILBERT FROM HIS CHILDHOOD UP THE THOUGHT THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HER OWN WILFUL PRIDE LONG LONG AGO HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HER SON
AND NO DOUBT THEY'RE AN AWFUL COLOR BUT THERE'S A MONTH YET AND DEW BLEACHING WILL WORK WONDERS ONLY A MONTH MARILLA SIGHED AND THEN SAID PROUDLY I'M GIVING ANNE THAT HALF DOZEN BRAIDED RUGS I HAVE IN THE GARRET
I'M SO GLAD YOU DO WANT HIM AUNT POLLY'S FACE HAD TURNED WHITE THEN RED THEN BACK TO WHITE AGAIN BUT WHEN SHE ANSWERED SHE SHOWED VERY PLAINLY THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO SPEAK LIGHTLY AND CHEERFULLY
I COULDN'T GUESS I WOULDN'T THINK SHE COULD FIND ANYTHIN ABOUT THAT TER BE GLAD ABOUT SHE DID SHE SAID I COULD BE GLAD ANYHOW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TER STOOP SO FAR TER DO MY WEEDIN
I HOPE YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY YOU HAVE MY BEST WISHES I'M SURE A LONG ENGAGEMENT DOESN'T OFTEN TURN OUT WELL BUT OF COURSE IN YOUR CASE IT COULDN'T BE HELPED
AN I DECLARE TER GOODNESS IF MISS POLLY HAIN'T
BUT I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO LET ME BE THE JUDGE THIS TIME BESIDES IT'S ALREADY ARRANGED THE NEW YORK DOCTOR IS COMING TO MORROW AS IT HAPPENED HOWEVER THE NEW YORK DOCTOR DID NOT COME TO MORROW
HER MARRIAGE HAD BEEN HAPPY WEALTH HAD NOT SPOILED HER SHE WAS STILL THE PLACID AMIABLE PINK CHEEKED JANE OF THE OLD QUARTETTE SYMPATHISING WITH HER OLD CHUM'S HAPPINESS AND AS KEENLY INTERESTED IN ALL THE DAINTY DETAILS OF ANNE'S TROUSSEAU
TWO OF THAT ILK DESCENDED UPON ANNE ONE VIOLET DUSK AND PROCEEDED TO DO WHAT IN THEM LAY TO PRICK THE RAINBOW BUBBLE OF HER SATISFACTION IF SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GETTING ANY PARTICULAR PRIZE IN YOUNG DOCTOR BLYTHE
BUT WHEN WE GET A PHONE IN THAT WON'T MATTER SO MUCH THE SITUATION IS BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKS TO THE SUNSET AND HAS THE GREAT BLUE HARBOR BEFORE IT THE SAND DUNES AREN'T VERY FAR AWAY THE SEA WINDS BLOW OVER THEM AND THE SEA SPRAY DRENCHES THEM
IT WAS WELL BUILT TO BEGIN WITH I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS SOME ROMANTIC STORY CONNECTED WITH ITS BUILDING BUT THE MAN I RENTED IT FROM DIDN'T KNOW IT HE SAID CAPTAIN JIM WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD SPIN THAT OLD YARN NOW WHO IS CAPTAIN JIM
I'D BELIEVE ANYTHIN O THE MISTRESS NOW EVEN THAT SHE'D TAKE TER PLAYIN IT HERSELF BUT HAIN'T THE LITTLE GAL TOLD HER EVER SHE'S TOLD EV'RY ONE ELSE I GUESS I'M HEARIN OF IT EV'RYWHERE NOW SINCE SHE WAS HURTED SAID TOM
THEN SHE SAID GENTLY THOUGH YET WITH A TOUCH OF HER OLD STERN DECISIVENESS BUT I DO MIND POLLYANNA I MIND VERY MUCH I WOULD DO ANYTHING ALMOST ANYTHING FOR YOU MY DEAR
SHE DIDN'T KNOW EM HERSELF SHE SAID FOLKS DIDN'T DOWN THERE THERE WAS A SLIGHT PAUSE THEN WITH A SIGH POLLYANNA RESUMED
GROWING MORE AND MORE JEALOUS MOMENT BY MOMENT STILL DOGGEDLY HE HELD HIS GROUND WELL ANYHOW HE SCOFFED I DON'T THINK MUCH OF HIS NAME JAMIE HUMPH SOUNDS SISSY
IF YOU KNEW HALF AS MUCH AS HE DOES YOU'D KNOW THAT TOO SHE FINISHED WITH FLASHING EYES JIMMY PENDLETON FLUSHED MISERABLY AND LOOKED UTTERLY WRETCHED
LIKE EATING DINNER AT NIGHT INSTEAD OF NOONS WHEN YOU OUGHT TO EAT IT BUT EVERYBODY WAS SO GOOD TO ME AND I SAW SUCH A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS BUNKER HILL AND THE PUBLIC GARDEN AND THE SEEING BOSTON AUTOS
THAT HAD TO DEAL WITH BIG FEARSOME SOUNDING WORDS BESIDES IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE WOULD NOT MISTER PENDLETON BE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN MISSUS CAREW'S TAKING THE BOY INTO HER HOME
BUT THE HOUSE ITSELF GILBERT OUR FIRST HOME WHAT IS IT LIKE NOT VERY LARGE BUT LARGE ENOUGH FOR US THERE'S A SPLENDID LIVING ROOM WITH A FIREPLACE IN IT DOWNSTAIRS AND A DINING ROOM THAT LOOKS OUT ON THE HARBOR
OH NO DEAR IT WASN'T DOCTOR CHILTON AT ALL THAT I MEANT IT IS A NEW DOCTOR A VERY FAMOUS DOCTOR FROM NEW YORK WHO WHO KNOWS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT ABOUT HURTS LIKE YOURS
IN TALKING OF JAMIE POLLYANNA LOST HER WORRIED BAFFLED LOOK POLLYANNA LOVED TO TALK OF JAMIE HERE WAS SOMETHING SHE UNDERSTOOD HERE WAS NO PROBLEM
WASN'T THERE ANYBODY ELSE DOWN TO BOSTON BUT JUST THAT EVERLASTING JAMIE WHY JIMMY BEAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED POLLYANNA THE BOY LIFTED HIS CHIN A LITTLE
SO THAT THE RICH PEOPLE COULD GIVE THE POOR PEOPLE PART OF THEIR MONEY BUT AGAIN MISTER PENDLETON INTERRUPTED WITH A LAUGH OH POLLYANNA POLLYANNA HE CHUCKLED I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GETTING INTO PRETTY DEEP WATER
THAT SHE COULD DO TO PLEASE HER NIECE I WOULDN'T A BELIEVED IT YOU COULDN'T A MADE ME BELIEVE IT NANCY SAID TO OLD TOM ONE MORNING
FORE MISS POLLYANNA COME SAY MISTER TOM WHO WAS HER A LOVER I HAIN'T FOUND THAT OUT YET I HAIN'T I HAIN'T HAIN'T YE ASKED THE OLD MAN WITH AN ODD LOOK ON HIS FACE
ONLY EMPHASIZED THE PITIFUL MOTIONLESSNESS OF THE ONCE ACTIVE LITTLE FEET AND LEGS NOW LYING SO WOEFULLY QUIET UNDER THE BLANKETS AS TO THE GAME POLLYANNA TOLD NANCY THESE DAYS HOW GLAD SHE WAS GOING TO BE
ON MOST OCCASIONS SHE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THE INTEREST SHOWN BUT ONE DAY SHE MET WITH A SURPRISE IT CAME THROUGH JIMMY PENDLETON SAY LOOK A HERE HE DEMANDED ONE AFTERNOON IRRITABLY
THE GODS SO SAYS THE OLD SUPERSTITION DO NOT LIKE TO BEHOLD TOO HAPPY MORTALS IT IS CERTAIN AT LEAST THAT SOME HUMAN BEINGS DO NOT
NO THERE'S PARTS OF IT OH I WAS GLAD TO BE THERE SHE EXPLAINED HASTILY I HAD A PERFECTLY LOVELY TIME AND LOTS OF THINGS WERE SO QUEER AND DIFFERENT YOU KNOW
WELL SHE DIDN'T TELL MISS POLLY REJOINED NANCY MISS POLLYANNA TOLD ME LONG AGO THAT SHE COULDN'T TELL HER CAUSE HER AUNT DIDN'T LIKE TER HAVE HER TALK ABOUT HER FATHER AN TWAS HER FATHER'S GAME
I'D LIKE TO BE ONE I DON'T DOUBT IT POLLYANNA SMILED THE MAN BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SCHEME OF YOURS FOR THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM ON YOUR HANDS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH
YES TWAS ALL ROUND ALL ROUND SIGHED NANCY IN HER TURN AS SHE WENT BACK TO HER KITCHEN FOR NO ONE WERE THOSE DAYS OF WAITING EASY THE NURSE TRIED TO LOOK CHEERFUL
WHICH WOULD BE SO EASY NOW YOU KNOW BUT AS BEFORE AUNT POLLY SHOOK HER HEAD AND SAID NO DEAR VERY DECISIVELY
THE HINGES ARE ON ONE TRUNK AND THE CATCH ON THE OTHER THEIR BOUGHS FORM AN ARCH OVERHEAD OH I'M SO GLAD I COULDN'T LIVE WHERE THERE WERE NO TREES SOMETHING VITAL IN ME WOULD STARVE
OH YES SHE TOLD ME LONG AGO THE OLD MAN HESITATED THEN WENT ON HIS LIPS TWITCHING A LITTLE I WAS GROWLIN ONE DAY CAUSE I WAS SO BENT UP AND CROOKED AN WHAT DO YE S'POSE THE LITTLE THING SAID
THAT SHE WOULD DO ANYTHING ANYTHING BUT THAT TO PLEASE HER DEAR POLLYANNA AS THE DAYS OF WAITING PASSED ONE BY ONE IT DID INDEED SEEM THAT AUNT POLLY WAS DOING EVERYTHING BUT THAT
BUT THE DEEPS OF HAPPINESS BELOW COULD NOT THUS BE DISTURBED AND THE LITTLE STINGS OF MESDAMES BELL AND ANDREWS WERE FORGOTTEN WHEN GILBERT CAME LATER AND THEY WANDERED DOWN TO THE BIRCHES OF THE BROOK WHICH HAD BEEN SAPLINGS WHEN ANNE HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES
BUT WERE NOW TALL IVORY COLUMNS IN A FAIRY PALACE OF TWILIGHT AND STARS IN THEIR SHADOWS ANNE AND GILBERT TALKED IN LOVER FASHION OF THEIR NEW HOME AND THEIR NEW LIFE TOGETHER I'VE FOUND A NEST FOR US ANNE OH WHERE
IF IF YOU DON'T MIND VERY MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DOCTOR CHILTON TRULY I WOULD A DISTRESSED COLOR SUFFUSED MISS POLLY'S FACE FOR A MOMENT SHE DID NOT SPEAK AT ALL
AT THE LAST MOMENT A TELEGRAM TOLD OF AN UNAVOIDABLE DELAY OWING TO THE SUDDEN ILLNESS OF THE SPECIALIST HIMSELF
WELL I GUESS YE WON'T THEN FROM ME OH MISTER TOM COME ON NOW WHEEDLED THE GIRL YE SEE THERE AIN'T MANY FOLKS HERE THAT I CAN ASK MAYBE NOT BUT THERE'S ONE ANYHOW THAT AIN'T ANSWERIN
I RECKON MAYBE THAT'S THE PART I DON'T LIKE THE MOST THAT FOLKS DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER IT WOULD BE SUCH A LOT NICER IF THEY DID WHY JUST THINK MISTER PENDLETON THERE ARE LOTS OF FOLKS THAT LIVE ON DIRTY NARROW STREETS
THERE IS A BIG GROVE OF FIR TREES BEHIND IT TWO ROWS OF LOMBARDY POPLARS DOWN THE LANE AND A RING OF WHITE BIRCHES AROUND A VERY DELIGHTFUL GARDEN OUR FRONT DOOR OPENS RIGHT INTO THE GARDEN
IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS PRAYED FOR SAID MISSUS RACHEL IN THE TONE OF ONE WHO IS COMFORTABLY SURE THAT HER PRAYERS HAVE AVAILED MUCH IT WAS A GREAT RELIEF TO FIND OUT THAT SHE REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE THE KINGSPORT MAN
IF TAIN'T MORE THAN TER LET IN THE CAT AN HER WHAT WOULDN'T LET FLUFF NOR BUFF UP STAIRS FOR LOVE NOR MONEY A WEEK AGO
THAT SHE WAS GROWING THIN AND PALE AS TO POLLYANNA POLLYANNA PETTED THE DOG SMOOTHED THE CAT'S SLEEK HEAD ADMIRED THE FLOWERS AND ATE THE FRUITS AND JELLIES THAT WERE SENT IN TO HER
WE STOPPED MOST A WEEK WITH A FARMER DAD HELPED ABOUT THE HAYIN' AND I DID TOO SOME THE FARMER'S WIFE WAS AWFUL GOOD TO ME AND PRETTY QUICK SHE WAS CALLIN ME JAMIE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT SHE JUST DID
AND I KNOW SOMEBODY ELSE THAT SAID SO TOO WHO WAS IT THERE WAS NO ANSWER WHO WAS IT DEMANDED POLLYANNA MORE PEREMPTORILY DAD
AN MISS POLLYANNA LOOKIN ON AN BOSSIN FROM THE BED
AND HIS WIFE HAD A BABY HERE BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WEDDING BEFORE IT DOES SEEM SO STRANGE TO THINK OF ANNE BEING MARRIED IN A WAY SHE JUST SEEMS TO ME THE LITTLE GIRL MATTHEW BROUGHT HOME HERE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO
BUT AS YET NOTHING HAD AVAILED TO STEEL HER AGAINST A REFERENCE TO HER HAIR SO IT IS SO IT IS CONCEDED MISSUS HARMON THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT QUEER FREAKS FASHION WILL TAKE
THERE AIN'T NO SPECIAL DIFF'RENCE AS I CAN SEE OR ANYBODY I GUESS SHE JEST LAYS THERE AN SLEEPS AN TALKS SOME AN TRIES TER SMILE AN BE GLAD CAUSE THE SUN SETS OR THE MOON RISES OR SOME OTHER SUCH THING
IT SEEMS REAL STRANGE
AND MILES OF PICTURES AND STATUES AND STORE WINDOWS AND STREETS THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY END AND FOLKS I NEVER SAW SUCH A LOT OF FOLKS WELL I'M SURE
SHE SELLS BOWS LOVELY BOWS IN A BIG STORE SHE WANTS TO KNOW PEOPLE AND I INTRODUCED HER TO MISSUS CAREW AND WE HAD HER UP TO THE HOUSE AND WE HAD JAMIE AND LOTS OF OTHERS THERE TOO AND SHE WAS SO GLAD TO KNOW THEM
SHE LOOKS LIKE FOLKS NOW SHE'S ACTUALLY ALMOST KEERFUL NOW NANCY INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN WITH A SLOW GRIN
BRIDLED THE LITTLE GIRL AGGRIEVEDLY AS THE MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH AND ANYWAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOME FOLKS SHOULD HAVE SUCH A LOT AND OTHER FOLKS SHOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING AND I DON'T LIKE IT
I NEVER SUPPOSED SHE'D WANT THEM THEY'RE SO OLD FASHIONED AND NOBODY SEEMS TO WANT ANYTHING BUT HOOKED MATS NOW BUT SHE ASKED ME FOR THEM SAID SHE'D RATHER HAVE THEM THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR HER FLOORS THEY ARE PRETTY
HUMAN NATURE IS NOT OBLIGED TO BE CONSISTENT
FOR WHO BETTER THAN HIMSELF COULD UNDERSTAND THE NEED OF A CHILD'S PRESENCE FOR THAT MATTER POLLYANNA TALKED TO EVERYBODY ABOUT JAMIE SHE ASSUMED THAT EVERYBODY WOULD BE AS INTERESTED AS SHE HERSELF WAS
HER CHEEKS WERE VERY RED TOO I SAY IF YOU LOVED DOCTOR CHILTON AND DIDN'T LOVE THE OTHER ONE SIGHED POLLYANNA SEEMS TO ME THAT WOULD MAKE SOME DIFFERENCE IN THE GOOD HE WOULD DO AND I LOVE DOCTOR CHILTON
OLD TOM CHUCKLED WELL IT STRIKES ME MISS POLLY HERSELF AIN'T LOOKIN NONE THE WORSE FOR WEARIN THEM ERE CURLS ROUND HER FOREHEAD HE OBSERVED DRYLY COURSE SHE AIN'T RETORTED NANCY INDIGNANTLY
AND YOU'VE KNOWN ME EVER SINCE REPEATED JIMMY BUT IN A FAR DIFFERENT VOICE JIMMY HAD SUDDENLY COME BACK TO THE PRESENT AND TO HIS GRIEVANCE BUT THEN I AIN'T JAMIE YOU KNOW HE FINISHED WITH SCORNFUL EMPHASIS
POLLYANNA'S FACE FELL I DON'T BELIEVE HE KNOWS HALF SO MUCH AS DOCTOR CHILTON OH YES HE DOES I'M SURE DEAR BUT IT WAS DOCTOR CHILTON WHO DOCTORED MISTER PENDLETON'S BROKEN LEG AUNT POLLY
CAUSE I WAS ALREADY BENT PART WAY OVER NANCY GAVE A WISTFUL LAUGH WELL I AIN'T SURPRISED AFTER ALL YOU MIGHT KNOW SHE'D FIND SOMETHIN WE'VE BEEN PLAYIN IT THAT GAME SINCE ALMOST THE FIRST
AND THAT'S WHAT MADE ME THINK THAT IF ONLY A LOT OF MISSUS CAREW'S KIND COULD KNOW THE OTHER KIND BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T DO THE INTRODUCING I DIDN'T KNOW MANY OF THEM MYSELF ANYWAY BUT IF THEY COULD KNOW EACH OTHER
CAUSE HE TOOK MISS JENNIE AWAY FROM EM AN MISS POLLY YOUNG AS SHE WAS COULDN'T NEVER FORGIVE HIM SHE WAS THAT FOND OF MISS JENNIE IN THEM DAYS I SEE I SEE TWAS A BAD MESS HE SIGHED AS HE TURNED AWAY
SURRENDERED AND LAUGHED WITH HIM WELL ANYWAY SHE REITERATED WHEN SHE HAD CAUGHT HER BREATH I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ALL THE SAME NO DEAR I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T AGREED THE MAN
I MADE THEM OF THE NICEST RAGS AND BRAIDED THEM IN STRIPES IT WAS SUCH COMPANY THESE LAST FEW WINTERS
SHE BELONGED TO THE TYPE WHICH ALWAYS HAS A STRINGY BLACK FEATHER IN ITS HAT AND STRAGGLING LOCKS OF HAIR ON ITS NECK ANNE'S SURFACE PLEASURE IN HER PRETTY BRIDAL THINGS WAS TEMPORARILY SHADOWED
BUT HER EYES WERE TROUBLED THE DOCTOR WAS OPENLY NERVOUS AND IMPATIENT MISS POLLY SAID LITTLE BUT EVEN THE SOFTENING WAVES OF HAIR ABOUT HER FACE AND THE BECOMING LACES AT HER THROAT COULD NOT HIDE THE FACT
THAT THESE PEOPLE DON'T CARE TO KNOW EACH OTHER HE ASKED QUIZZICALLY OH BUT SOME OF THEM DO MAINTAINED POLLYANNA IN EAGER DEFENSE
IT WAS SURELY THEIR DUTY TO PUT THE MATTER BEFORE HER IN ANOTHER LIGHT YET THESE TWO WORTHY LADIES WERE NOT ENEMIES OF ANNE ON THE CONTRARY THEY WERE REALLY QUITE FOND OF HER
GLEN SAINT MARY FOLKS PREFER PLUSH BROCADE AND SIDEBOARDS WITH MIRRORS AND ORNAMENTATIONS I FANCY BUT MISS RUSSELL'S FURNITURE IS VERY GOOD AND I FEEL SURE YOU'LL LIKE IT ANNE SO FAR GOOD SAID ANNE
THE NAME JAMIE THAT WAS DUBBED SISSY THE BOY SIGHED WE JUST WENT ON TILL WE FOUND ANOTHER PLACE AND TWAS THERE DAD DIED
I'M GOING TO GIVE ANNE TWO OF MY COTTON WARP SPREADS SHE RESUMED A TOBACCO STRIPE ONE AND AN APPLE LEAF ONE SHE TELLS ME THEY'RE GETTING TO BE REAL FASHIONABLE AGAIN
YES AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER WHO LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR CHEAPSIDE THAT IS CAPITAL ADDED HER SISTER AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY
OH YES I UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY I WISH I MIGHT TAKE THIS FOR A COMPLIMENT BUT TO BE SO EASILY SEEN THROUGH I AM AFRAID IS PITIFUL THAT IS AS IT HAPPENS
ON MISS BINGLEY'S APPEARANCE AND INVITATION THE MOTHER AND THREE DAUGHTERS ALL ATTENDED HER INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR BINGLEY MET THEM WITH HOPES THAT MISSUS BENNET HAD NOT FOUND MISS BENNET WORSE THAN SHE EXPECTED
WHICH WAS SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY OPENED FOR HIS ADMISSION BY CAESAR THE HEAVY TREAD OF THE TROOPER AS HE FOLLOWED THE BLACK TO THE DOOR OF THE PARLOR RANG IN THE EARS OF THE FEMALES AS IT APPROACHED NEARER AND NEARER
I CANNOT BOAST OF KNOWING MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE THAT ARE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED NOR I I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY THEN
DARCY ONLY SMILED AND THE GENERAL PAUSE WHICH ENSUED MADE ELIZABETH TREMBLE LEST HER MOTHER SHOULD BE EXPOSING HERSELF AGAIN SHE LONGED TO SPEAK BUT COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO SAY
AND DROVE THE BLOOD FROM THEIR FACES TO THEIR HEARTS WITH A CHILL THAT NEARLY ANNIHILATED FEELING A MAN WHOSE COLOSSAL STATURE MANIFESTED THE POSSESSION OF VAST STRENGTH ENTERED THE ROOM AND REMOVING HIS CAP
LOOKING AT HIM AFFECTIONATELY MUCH AS I LOVE MY OWN COUNTRY THE APPROACH OF HER TROOPS JUST NOW WOULD GIVE ME GREAT PAIN THE BROTHER MADE NO REPLY BUT RETURNING THE FONDNESS EXPRESSED IN HER EYE BY A LOOK OF FRATERNAL TENDERNESS
HIS APPEARANCE DID NOT INDICATE AS BELONGING TO HIS NATURE HIS DARK HAIR HUNG AROUND HIS BROW IN PROFUSION THOUGH STAINED WITH POWDER WHICH WAS WORN AT THAT DAY AND HIS FACE WAS NEARLY HID IN THE WHISKERS BY WHICH IT WAS DISFIGURED
LYDIA WAS A STOUT WELL GROWN GIRL OF FIFTEEN WITH A FINE COMPLEXION AND GOOD HUMOURED COUNTENANCE A FAVOURITE WITH HER MOTHER WHOSE AFFECTION HAD BROUGHT HER INTO PUBLIC AT AN EARLY AGE SHE HAD HIGH ANIMAL SPIRITS
COULD NOT BE PREVAILED ON TO JOIN IN THEIR CENSURE OF HER IN SPITE OF ALL MISS BINGLEY'S WITTICISMS ON
MISTER WHARTON GROANED ALOUD BUT THE LADIES IGNORANT OF THE EXTENT OF THEIR VISITOR'S KNOWLEDGE REMAINED IN TREMBLING YET RIGID SILENCE THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF MOVED HIS HAND INVOLUNTARILY TO HIS HEAD
AND NEVER OPEN THEIR MOUTHS QUITE MISTAKE THE MATTER DID CHARLOTTE DINE WITH YOU NO SHE WOULD GO HOME I FANCY SHE WAS WANTED ABOUT THE MINCE PIES
THAT SHE SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS HERSELF ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM SHE FOUND THE WHOLE PARTY AT LOO AND WAS IMMEDIATELY INVITED TO JOIN THEM BUT SUSPECTING THEM TO BE PLAYING HIGH SHE DECLINED IT
FOR MY PART MISTER BINGLEY I ALWAYS KEEP SERVANTS THAT CAN DO THEIR OWN WORK MY DAUGHTERS ARE BROUGHT UP VERY DIFFERENTLY BUT EVERYBODY IS TO JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THE LUCASES ARE A VERY GOOD SORT OF GIRLS I ASSURE YOU IT IS A PITY THEY ARE NOT HANDSOME
IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS
I WILL BUY PEMBERLEY ITSELF IF DARCY WILL SELL IT I AM TALKING OF POSSIBILITIES CHARLES UPON MY WORD CAROLINE I SHOULD THINK IT MORE POSSIBLE TO GET PEMBERLEY BY PURCHASE THAN BY IMITATION
HIS COUNTENANCE GRADUALLY LIGHTING INTO A SMILE OF PLEASURE
RISING FROM HIS CHAIR AND WAITING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE REPLY HAS THERE BEEN A STRANGE GENTLEMAN STAYING WITH YOU DURING THE STORM CONTINUED THE DRAGOON SPEAKING WITH INTEREST AND IN SOME DEGREE SHARING IN THE EVIDENT ANXIETY OF THE FATHER
THE NOTE WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED AND ITS CONTENTS AS QUICKLY COMPLIED WITH MISSUS BENNET ACCOMPANIED BY HER TWO YOUNGEST GIRLS REACHED NETHERFIELD SOON AFTER THE FAMILY BREAKFAST HAD SHE FOUND JANE IN ANY APPARENT DANGER
I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED
MY BUSINESS WILL BE CONFINED TO A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH IF FREELY ANSWERED WILL INSTANTLY REMOVE US FROM YOUR DWELLING AND WHAT MAY THEY BE SIR STAMMERED MISTER WHARTON
AND BY THAT TIME MOST LIKELY CAPTAIN CARTER WOULD BE AT MERYTON AGAIN AND WHEN YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR BALL SHE ADDED I SHALL INSIST ON THEIR GIVING ONE ALSO I SHALL TELL COLONEL FORSTER IT WILL BE QUITE A SHAME IF HE DOES NOT
I WISH IT MAY BUT I WOULD REALLY ADVISE YOU TO MAKE YOUR PURCHASE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TAKE PEMBERLEY FOR A KIND OF MODEL THERE IS NOT A FINER COUNTY IN ENGLAND THAN DERBYSHIRE WITH ALL MY HEART
NOTHING BUT CONCERN FOR ELIZABETH COULD ENABLE BINGLEY TO KEEP HIS COUNTENANCE HIS SISTER WAS LESS DELICATE AND DIRECTED HER EYES TOWARDS MISTER DARCY WITH A VERY EXPRESSIVE SMILE
IN ESKE OR LIDDEL FORDS WERE NONE BUT HE WOULD RIDE THEM ONE BY ONE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIME OR TIDE DECEMBER'S SNOW OR JULY'S PRIDE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIDE OR TIME MOONLESS MIDNIGHT OR MATIN PRIME
THOUGH THE UNTASTED COFFEE SUFFICIENTLY PROVED THAT BY NONE OF HIS RELATIVES WAS HIS ABSENCE DISREGARDED I THINK I DID MUCH BETTER HE CRIED TAKING A CHAIR BETWEEN HIS SISTERS AND RECEIVING THEIR OFFERED SALUTES
AND SAT WITH HER TILL SUMMONED TO COFFEE SHE WAS STILL VERY POORLY AND ELIZABETH WOULD NOT QUIT HER AT ALL TILL LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF SEEING HER SLEEP AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HER RATHER RIGHT THAN PLEASANT
MISTER HARPER ECHOED THE OTHER FEELING A LOAD REMOVED FROM HIS HEART YES I HAD FORGOTTEN BUT HE IS GONE AND IF THERE BE ANYTHING WRONG IN HIS CHARACTER WE ARE IN ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF IT
YOU WILL NOT THINK OF QUITTING IT IN A HURRY I HOPE THOUGH YOU HAVE BUT A SHORT LEASE WHATEVER I DO IS DONE IN A HURRY REPLIED HE AND THEREFORE IF I SHOULD RESOLVE TO QUIT NETHERFIELD I SHOULD PROBABLY BE OFF IN FIVE MINUTES
THE SUSPENSE OF THE PARTY WITHIN WHO WERE ALL HIGHLY INTERESTED WITNESSES OF THIS SCENE
WHERE THE FAMILY WERE ALREADY COLLECTED IN THE GREATEST CONSTERNATION
THE WORD IS APPLIED TO MANY A WOMAN WHO DESERVES IT NO OTHERWISE THAN BY NETTING A PURSE OR COVERING A SCREEN BUT I AM VERY FAR FROM AGREEING WITH YOU IN YOUR ESTIMATION OF LADIES IN GENERAL
SIX INCHES DEEP IN MUD I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN AND THE GOWN WHICH HAD BEEN LET DOWN TO HIDE IT NOT DOING ITS OFFICE YOUR PICTURE MAY BE VERY EXACT LOUISA SAID BINGLEY BUT THIS WAS ALL LOST UPON ME
HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND LEFT THE APARTMENT THE WHARTONS JUDGING FROM HIS MANNER THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED IN QUEST OF THE OBJECT OF HIS INQUIRIES THEY OBSERVED THE DRAGOON ON
IT WOULD NOT MAKE THEM ONE JOT LESS AGREEABLE BUT IT MUST VERY MATERIALLY LESSEN THEIR CHANCE OF MARRYING MEN OF ANY CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD REPLIED DARCY TO THIS SPEECH BINGLEY MADE NO ANSWER
AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE WHEN NOT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THEM RESTORED ELIZABETH TO THE ENJOYMENT OF ALL HER FORMER DISLIKE THEIR BROTHER INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHOM SHE COULD REGARD WITH ANY COMPLACENCY
HE APPROACHED THE YOUTH WITH AN AIR OF COMIC GRAVITY AND WITH A LOW BOW CONTINUED I AM SORRY FOR THE SEVERE COLD YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD SIR I EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN IN SURPRISE
BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO BE DANCING WHEN SHE IS ILL LYDIA DECLARED HERSELF SATISFIED
TURNING TO HIS YOUNGER AND EVIDENTLY FAVORITE SISTER AND TAPPING HER CHEEK DID YOU SEE BANNERS IN THE CLOUDS AND MISTAKE MISS PEYTON'S AEOLIAN HARP FOR REBELLIOUS MUSIC NAY HENRY REJOINED THE MAID
BUT THEY WERE ALL HAUGHTILY REJECTED BY THE YOUNG MAN AS UNWORTHY OF HIS CHARACTER IT WAS TOO LATE TO RETREAT TO THE WOODS IN THE REAR OF THE COTTAGE FOR HE WOULD UNAVOIDABLY BE SEEN AND FOLLOWED BY A TROOP OF HORSE AS INEVITABLY TAKEN
OFFENDED BY HIS MANNER OF MENTIONING A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD I ASSURE YOU THERE IS QUITE AS MUCH OF THAT GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY AS IN TOWN EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AND DARCY AFTER LOOKING AT HER FOR A MOMENT
AND FORCED HIS YOUNGER SISTER TO BE CIVIL ALSO AND SAY WHAT THE OCCASION REQUIRED SHE PERFORMED HER PART INDEED WITHOUT MUCH GRACIOUSNESS BUT MISSUS BENNET WAS SATISFIED AND SOON AFTERWARDS ORDERED HER CARRIAGE UPON THIS SIGNAL
MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE
STILL THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE THOUGH PIERCING WAS NOT BAD AND HIS VOICE THOUGH DEEP AND POWERFUL WAS FAR FROM UNPLEASANT FRANCES VENTURED TO THROW A TIMID GLANCE AT HIS FIGURE AS HE ENTERED
SAID MISS BINGLEY WILL SHE BE AS TALL AS I AM I THINK SHE WILL SHE IS NOW ABOUT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET'S HEIGHT OR RATHER TALLER HOW I LONG TO SEE HER AGAIN I NEVER MET
WITH BITTER COMPLAINTS OF THEIR INATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING FORWARD AS ALL CONVERSATION WAS THEREBY AT AN END ELIZABETH SOON AFTERWARDS LEFT THE ROOM ELIZABETH BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON HER
TO ME HE WAS A TOTAL STRANGER YOU HAVE BUT LITTLE TO APPREHEND FROM HIS CHARACTER ANSWERED THE DRAGOON DRYLY BUT HE IS GONE HOW WHEN AND WHITHER
NOTHING REMAINED NOW BUT TO MEET THE IMPENDING EXAMINATION WITH AS MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS THE FAMILY COULD ASSUME THE LEADER OF THE HORSE DISMOUNTED AND FOLLOWED BY A COUPLE OF HIS MEN HE APPROACHED THE OUTER DOOR OF THE BUILDING
THEY HAVE EACH THEIR ADVANTAGES AND I CAN BE EQUALLY HAPPY IN EITHER AYE THAT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT DISPOSITION BUT THAT GENTLEMAN LOOKING AT DARCY SEEMED TO THINK THE COUNTRY WAS NOTHING AT ALL
REMOVED CRIED BINGLEY IT MUST NOT BE THOUGHT OF MY SISTER I AM SURE WILL NOT HEAR OF HER REMOVAL YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT MADAM SAID MISS BINGLEY WITH COLD CIVILITY
I DO NOT TRUST MY OWN PARTIALITY WHEN SHE WAS ONLY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A MAN AT MY BROTHER GARDINER'S IN TOWN SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER THAT MY SISTER IN LAW WAS SURE HE WOULD MAKE HER AN OFFER BEFORE WE CAME AWAY
COMPOSE THE SEASON FOR ENJOYMENT IN THE OPEN AIR THEY HAVE THEIR STORMS BUT THEY ARE DISTINCT AND NOT OF LONG CONTINUANCE LEAVING A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE AND A CLOUDLESS SKY
THE SISTERS DESCENDED TO THE PARLOR WITH A RETURNING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR BROTHER'S SECURITY AND THEIR OWN HAPPINESS THE FAMILY WERE EARLY IN ASSEMBLING AROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND MISS PEYTON WITH A LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE
AND SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FROM THE TWO ELEGANT LADIES WHO WAITED ON HIS SISTERS IN SPITE OF THIS AMENDMENT HOWEVER SHE REQUESTED TO HAVE A NOTE SENT TO LONGBOURN DESIRING HER MOTHER TO VISIT JANE AND FORM HER OWN JUDGEMENT OF HER SITUATION
ADDED DARCY AND TO ALL THIS SHE MUST YET ADD SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND BY EXTENSIVE READING I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED AT YOUR KNOWING ONLY SIX ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN
AND THEY ROSE FROM THEIR BEDS ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING UNREFRESHED AND ALMOST WITHOUT HAVING CLOSED THEIR EYES ON TAKING AN EAGER AND HASTY SURVEY OF THE VALLEY FROM THE WINDOWS OF THEIR ROOM NOTHING HOWEVER BUT ITS USUAL SERENITY WAS TO BE SEEN
INDEED MAMMA YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID ELIZABETH BLUSHING FOR HER MOTHER YOU QUITE MISTOOK MISTER DARCY HE ONLY MEANT THAT THERE WAS NOT SUCH A VARIETY OF PEOPLE TO BE MET WITH IN THE COUNTRY AS IN THE TOWN
IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
GAINING THE LAWN IN EARNEST AND APPARENTLY PLEASED CONVERSATION WITH HIS TWO SUBALTERNS IN A FEW MOMENTS ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE TROOPS AND HORSEMEN LEFT THE VALLEY AT FULL SPEED BY ITS VARIOUS ROADS
AT PRESENT HOWEVER I CONSIDER MYSELF AS QUITE FIXED HERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED OF YOU SAID ELIZABETH YOU BEGIN TO COMPREHEND ME DO YOU CRIED HE TURNING TOWARDS HER
THE YOUNGEST OF HER DAUGHTERS PUT HERSELF FORWARD THE TWO GIRLS HAD BEEN WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER DURING THE WHOLE VISIT AND THE RESULT OF IT WAS THAT THE YOUNGEST SHOULD TAX MISTER BINGLEY WITH HAVING PROMISED ON HIS FIRST COMING INTO THE COUNTRY TO GIVE A BALL AT NETHERFIELD
HE IMMEDIATELY OFFERED TO FETCH HER OTHERS ALL THAT HIS LIBRARY AFFORDED AND I WISH MY COLLECTION WERE LARGER FOR YOUR BENEFIT AND MY OWN CREDIT BUT I AM AN IDLE FELLOW AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT MANY I HAVE MORE THAN I EVER LOOKED INTO
THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS HASTILY AND IMPERFECTLY COMPLETED AS THE DRAGOONS ENTERED THE LAWN AND ORCHARD OF THE LOCUSTS RIDING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF THE WIND AND IN THEIR TURN THE WHARTONS WERE SURROUNDED
ARE YOU SO SEVERE UPON YOUR OWN SEX AS TO DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THIS I NEVER SAW SUCH A WOMAN I NEVER SAW SUCH CAPACITY AND TASTE AND APPLICATION AND ELEGANCE AS YOU DESCRIBE UNITED
VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MATTERS OF NO TRIFLING CONCERN WERE ON THE CARPET A SHORT COMMUNICATION WITH THE LOQUACIOUS HOUSEKEEPER FOLLOWED THE ARRIVAL OF THE MAIN BODY OF THE TROOP AND THE ADVANCE PARTY REMOUNTING
NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING AND THE MODERN LANGUAGES TO DESERVE THE WORD
MISSUS BENNET AND HER DAUGHTERS THEN DEPARTED AND ELIZABETH RETURNED INSTANTLY TO JANE LEAVING HER OWN AND HER RELATIONS BEHAVIOUR TO THE REMARKS OF THE TWO LADIES AND MISTER DARCY THE LATTER OF WHOM HOWEVER
CHAPTER FIVE THROUGH SOLWAY SANDS THROUGH TAROSS MOSS BLINDFOLD HE KNEW THE PATHS TO CROSS BY WILY TURNS BY DESPERATE BOUNDS HAD BAFFLED PERCY'S BEST BLOODHOUNDS
INDEED I HAVE SIR WAS HER ANSWER SHE IS A GREAT DEAL TOO ILL TO BE MOVED MISTER JONES SAYS WE MUST NOT THINK OF MOVING HER WE MUST TRESPASS A LITTLE LONGER ON YOUR KINDNESS
AT LENGTH HIS SISTERS WITH TREMBLING HANDS REPLACED HIS ORIGINAL DISGUISE THE INSTRUMENTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN CAREFULLY KEPT AT HAND BY CAESAR IN EXPECTATION OF SOME SUDDEN EMERGENCY
ELIZABETH FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT TURN HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS NOW ASKED HER IF CHARLOTTE LUCAS HAD BEEN AT LONGBOURN SINCE HER COMING AWAY
HE REPLIED THEY WERE BRIGHTENED BY THE EXERCISE A SHORT PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS SPEECH AND MISSUS HURST BEGAN AGAIN I HAVE AN EXCESSIVE REGARD FOR MISS JANE BENNET SHE IS REALLY A VERY SWEET GIRL
WITH ANYBODY WHO DELIGHTED ME SO MUCH SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS AND SO EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED FOR HER AGE HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE IS EXQUISITE IT IS AMAZING TO ME SAID BINGLEY
THEY HAVE AT LEAST THAT ADVANTAGE THE COUNTRY SAID DARCY CAN IN GENERAL SUPPLY BUT A FEW SUBJECTS FOR SUCH A STUDY IN A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD YOU MOVE IN A VERY CONFINED AND UNVARYING SOCIETY
I DID NOT KNOW BEFORE CONTINUED BINGLEY IMMEDIATELY THAT YOU WERE A STUDIER OF CHARACTER IT MUST BE AN AMUSING STUDY
BUT PEOPLE THEMSELVES ALTER SO MUCH
AND SAW AT ONCE THE MAN FROM WHOSE SCRUTINY HARVEY BIRCH HAD WARNED THEM THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE APPREHENDED YOU HAVE NO CAUSE FOR ALARM LADIES SAID THE OFFICER PAUSING A MOMENT AND CONTEMPLATING THE PALE FACES AROUND HIM
SO MUCH THE MAN OF FASHION SO GENTEEL AND EASY HE HAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO SAY TO EVERYBODY THAT IS MY IDEA OF GOOD BREEDING AND THOSE PERSONS WHO FANCY THEMSELVES VERY IMPORTANT
MISSUS HURST AND MISS BINGLEY BOTH CRIED OUT AGAINST THE INJUSTICE OF HER IMPLIED DOUBT AND WERE BOTH PROTESTING THAT THEY KNEW MANY WOMEN WHO ANSWERED THIS DESCRIPTION WHEN MISTER HURST CALLED THEM TO ORDER
HE GENTLY PRESSED HER HAND IN SILENCE WHEN CAESAR WHO HAD PARTICIPATED LARGELY IN THE ANXIETY OF THE FAMILY AND WHO HAD RISEN WITH THE DAWN AND KEPT A VIGILANT WATCH ON THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS AS HE STOOD GAZING FROM ONE OF THE WINDOWS
RECOMMENDED AN EXPRESS TO TOWN FOR ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PHYSICIANS THIS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH THEIR BROTHER'S PROPOSAL AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT MISTER JONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR EARLY IN THE MORNING
IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT A DEEP INTRICATE CHARACTER IS MORE OR LESS ESTIMABLE THAN SUCH A ONE AS YOURS LIZZY CRIED HER MOTHER REMEMBER WHERE YOU ARE AND DO NOT RUN ON IN THE WILD MANNER THAT YOU ARE SUFFERED TO DO AT HOME
SHE HAS NOTHING IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND HER BUT BEING AN EXCELLENT WALKER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER APPEARANCE THIS MORNING SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA
AND A SORT OF NATURAL SELF CONSEQUENCE WHICH THE ATTENTION OF THE OFFICERS TO WHOM HER UNCLE'S GOOD DINNERS AND HER OWN EASY MANNERS RECOMMENDED HER HAD INCREASED INTO ASSURANCE
WALTER SCOTT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE WHARTON FAMILY LAID THEIR HEADS ON THEIR PILLOWS THAT NIGHT WITH A FOREBODING OF SOME INTERRUPTION TO THEIR ORDINARY QUIET UNEASINESS KEPT THE SISTERS FROM ENJOYING THEIR USUAL REPOSE
MISS BINGLEY WAS ENGROSSED BY MISTER DARCY HER SISTER SCARCELY LESS SO AND AS FOR MISTER HURST BY WHOM ELIZABETH SAT HE WAS AN INDOLENT MAN
OF A FINE STOUT HEALTHY LOVE IT MAY EVERYTHING NOURISHES WHAT IS STRONG ALREADY BUT IF IT BE ONLY A SLIGHT THIN SORT OF INCLINATION I AM CONVINCED THAT ONE GOOD SONNET WILL STARVE IT ENTIRELY AWAY
I HAVE NO COLD IN MY HEAD I FANCIED IT THEN FROM SEEING YOU HAD COVERED SUCH HANDSOME BLACK LOCKS WITH THAT UGLY OLD WIG IT WAS MY MISTAKE YOU WILL PLEASE TO PARDON IT
RUN MASSA HARRY RUN
AND MAKING HER SISTER THE EXCUSE SAID SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE COULD STAY BELOW WITH A BOOK MISTER HURST LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU PREFER READING TO CARDS SAID HE THAT IS RATHER SINGULAR
AND ABRUPTLY REMINDED HIM OF HIS PROMISE
SAID BINGLEY I AM AFRAID MISTER DARCY OBSERVED MISS BINGLEY IN A HALF WHISPER THAT THIS ADVENTURE HAS RATHER AFFECTED YOUR ADMIRATION OF HER FINE EYES
HIS HOUSE WAS SURROUNDED BY A DOZEN SENTINELS TWO OR THREE OF THE DRAGOONS NOW DISMOUNTED AND DISAPPEARED IN A FEW MINUTES HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO THE YARD FOLLOWED BY KATY FROM WHOSE
WHATEVER BEARS AFFINITY TO CUNNING IS DESPICABLE MISS BINGLEY WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY AS TO CONTINUE THE SUBJECT
THE SISTERS ON HEARING THIS REPEATED THREE OR FOUR TIMES HOW MUCH THEY WERE GRIEVED HOW SHOCKING IT WAS TO HAVE A BAD COLD AND HOW EXCESSIVELY THEY DISLIKED BEING ILL THEMSELVES AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER
HAD PLEASANTLY INSISTED THAT THE ABSENCE OF HER NEPHEW SHOULD IN NO MANNER INTERFERE WITH THE REGULAR HOURS SHE HAD ESTABLISHED CONSEQUENTLY THE PARTY WERE ALREADY SEATED WHEN THE CAPTAIN MADE HIS APPEARANCE
TURNED SILENTLY AWAY MISSUS BENNET WHO FANCIED SHE HAD GAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY OVER HIM CONTINUED HER TRIUMPH I CANNOT SEE THAT LONDON HAS ANY GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER THE COUNTRY FOR MY PART
OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT
ELIZABETH JOINED THEM AGAIN ONLY TO SAY THAT HER SISTER WAS WORSE AND THAT SHE COULD NOT LEAVE HER BINGLEY URGED MISTER JONES BEING SENT FOR IMMEDIATELY WHILE HIS SISTERS CONVINCED THAT NO COUNTRY ADVICE COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE
BUT HOWEVER HE DID NOT PERHAPS HE THOUGHT HER TOO YOUNG HOWEVER HE WROTE SOME VERSES ON HER AND VERY PRETTY THEY WERE AND SO ENDED HIS AFFECTION SAID ELIZABETH IMPATIENTLY
HIS ANSWER TO THIS SUDDEN ATTACK WAS DELIGHTFUL TO THEIR MOTHER'S EAR I AM PERFECTLY READY I ASSURE YOU TO KEEP MY ENGAGEMENT AND WHEN YOUR SISTER IS RECOVERED YOU SHALL IF YOU PLEASE NAME THE VERY DAY OF THE BALL
CHARLES WHEN YOU BUILD YOUR HOUSE
RUN REPEATED THE BRITISH OFFICER GATHERING HIMSELF UP IN MILITARY PRIDE NO MISTER CAESAR RUNNING IS NOT MY TRADE WHILE SPEAKING HE WALKED DELIBERATELY TO THE WINDOW
AND HAS NOT YET DEPARTED THIS GENTLEMAN REPEATED THE OTHER TURNING TO CAPTAIN WHARTON AND CONTEMPLATING HIS FIGURE FOR A MOMENT
A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED THERE IS A MEANNESS IN ALL THE ARTS WHICH LADIES SOMETIMES CONDESCEND TO EMPLOY FOR CAPTIVATION
TO THE CIVIL INQUIRIES WHICH THEN POURED IN AND AMONGST WHICH SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF DISTINGUISHING THE MUCH SUPERIOR SOLICITUDE OF MISTER BINGLEY'S SHE COULD NOT MAKE A VERY FAVOURABLE ANSWER JANE WAS BY NO MEANS BETTER
THERE HAS BEEN MANY A ONE I FANCY OVERCOME IN THE SAME WAY I WONDER WHO FIRST DISCOVERED THE EFFICACY OF POETRY IN DRIVING AWAY LOVE I HAVE BEEN USED TO CONSIDER POETRY AS THE FOOD OF LOVE SAID DARCY
AND DISCOVERED THAT THE TREPIDATION OF HIS SISTERS HAD LEFT SOME OF HIS NATURAL HAIR EXPOSED THE DRAGOON WATCHED THE MOVEMENT WITH A CONTINUED SMILE WHEN SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF TURNING TO THE FATHER HE PROCEEDED
AND I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART SHE WERE WELL SETTLED BUT WITH SUCH A FATHER AND MOTHER AND SUCH LOW CONNECTIONS I AM AFRAID THERE IS NO CHANCE OF IT
BUT HIS SISTERS GAVE IT THEIR HEARTY ASSENT AND INDULGED THEIR MIRTH FOR SOME TIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR DEAR FRIEND'S VULGAR RELATIONS
WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER WHEN DINNER WAS OVER SHE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO JANE AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM
NOT THAT I THINK CHARLOTTE SO VERY PLAIN BUT THEN SHE IS OUR PARTICULAR FRIEND
CERTAINLY NOT TO WALK THREE MILES OR FOUR MILES OR FIVE MILES
WHICH YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE TRUE CERTAINLY MY DEAR NOBODY SAID THERE WERE BUT AS TO NOT MEETING WITH MANY PEOPLE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW NEIGHBOURHOODS LARGER I KNOW WE DINE WITH FOUR AND TWENTY FAMILIES
IN A TINE OF PERFECT GOOD FELLOWSHIP WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOU ALL THESE DAYS
WHAT HAS BECOME OF YOUR THREE COMPANIONS
EVERYONE TO RETURN HOME AND WAIT FOR NEWS
IN WHOSE SERVICE HE HAD A RELATIVE
BUT ONE HAS COME OF ITSELF WHAT DO YOU MEAN BLOCKHEAD I MEAN TO SAY THAT WHEN I CAME IN ALTHOUGH I HAD THE KEY OF YOUR APARTMENT IN MY POCKET
FOR THAT VERY EVENING BUT WE ARE BOUND TO SAY TO THE CREDIT OF OUR HERO
ARE THE NATURAL ENEMIES OF THE GUARDSMEN WHO BELONG TO THE CARDINAL YES TREVILLE YES SAID THE KING IN A MELANCHOLY TONE AND IT IS VERY SAD BELIEVE ME TO SEE THUS TWO PARTIES IN FRANCE TWO HEADS TO ROYALTY
HIS HEART SWELLED BY THE INTOXICATION OF JOY FELT READY TO DISSOLVE AWAY AT THE VERY GATE OF THAT TERRESTRIAL PARADISE CALLED LOVE
AND AS D'ARTAGNAN STOOD FIRM IT WAS HIS ADVERSARY WHO MADE THE RETREATING STEP BUT D'ARTAGNAN SEIZED THE MOMENT AT WHICH IN THIS MOVEMENT THE SWORD OF BERNAJOUX DEVIATED FROM THE LINE HE FREED HIS WEAPON MADE A LUNGE AND TOUCHED HIS ADVERSARY ON THE SHOULDER
BRAVE YOUNG MAN MURMURED THE KING WELL HE DID REMAIN WITH THEM AND YOUR MAJESTY HAS IN HIM SO FIRM A CHAMPION THAT IT WAS HE WHO GAVE JUSSAC THE TERRIBLE SWORD THRUST WHICH HAS MADE THE CARDINAL SO ANGRY
HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU WHY SO PLANCHET ASKED THE YOUNG MAN
AND HOW THE DEVIL DID YOU ESCAPE
BUT YOUR COMPANIONS I DON'T THINK THEY CAN BE IN NEED OF ANY WE LEFT PARIS EACH WITH SEVENTY FIVE PISTOLES IN HIS POCKET SHALL I SEE YOU AGAIN BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE
THEY MERIT RICHLY THAT PIECE OF ATTENTION ON YOUR PART
ALTHOUGH HE PLAYED WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE FOUND THAT HIS WOUND WAS YET TOO RECENT TO ALLOW OF SUCH EXERTION
HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE REMARKED IT
AND LET US ENDEAVOR TO SEE THE KING BEFORE HE IS PREJUDICED BY THE CARDINAL
BUT ON THE CONTRARY FOR HIM WHOSE PEOPLE THE MUSKETEERS HAD ASSAULTED AND WHOSE HOTEL THEY HAD ENDEAVORED TO BURN NOW AS THE DEBATE BETWEEN THESE TWO NOBLES MIGHT LAST A LONG TIME EACH BECOMING NATURALLY MORE FIRM IN HIS OWN OPINION
THE MASTER OF THE HOUNDS CAME THIS MORNING TO INFORM HIM THAT HE HAD MARKED DOWN A STAG AT FIRST THE KING ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD NOT GO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST HIS LOVE OF SPORT AND SET OUT AFTER DINNER AND THE KING HAS SEEN THE CARDINAL
THE KING THEREFORE AROSE A MINUTE AFTER AND PUTTING THE MONEY WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM INTO HIS POCKET
WHILE READING THIS LETTER D'ARTAGNAN FELT HIS HEART DILATED AND COMPRESSED BY THAT DELICIOUS SPASM WHICH TORTURES AND CARESSES THE HEARTS OF LOVERS IT WAS THE FIRST BILLET HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM
BRUSH OFF YOUR BOOTS YESTERDAY FROM THE PAVEMENT OF PARIS
AT THESE CRIES ALL WHO WERE IN THE HOTEL RUSHED OUT AND FELL UPON THE FOUR COMPANIONS WHO ON THEIR SIDE CRIED ALOUD TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS THIS CRY WAS GENERALLY HEEDED
NO BUT THANKS TO THIS DIAMOND REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN
PARTICULARLY IN THE NIGHT WHAT THE DEUCE CAN YOU EXPECT I AM NO SWORDSMAN WELL DON'T BE ALARMED IF I RETURN AT ONE TWO OR THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
NOW LET US TALK ABOUT YOURSELF MY YOUNG FRIEND
THERE ARE MANY THANKS TO BE OFFERED TO YOU AND TO BE TRANSMITTED TO YOU BE THIS EVENING ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT SAINT CLOUD
WHOSE RELATIVE AS WE ALREADY KNOW BERNAJOUX WAS
IT IS AS I HAVE THE HONOR TO RELATE IT TO YOUR MAJESTY JUSSAC ONE OF THE FIRST SWORDSMEN IN THE KINGDOM WELL SIRE FOR ONCE HE FOUND HIS MASTER I WILL SEE THIS YOUNG MAN TREVILLE I WILL SEE HIM AND IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE
DID I NOT GUESS TRULY IS IT NOT SOME BAD AFFAIR
EXCITEMENT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AMONG THE MUSKETEERS AND THEIR ALLIES AND THEY EVEN BEGAN TO DELIBERATE WHETHER THEY SHOULD NOT SET FIRE TO THE HOTEL
THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN PERCEIVE THEIR YOUNG COMPANION GO OUT WHO AS HE HAD TOLD THE GUARDSMAN OF HIS EMINENCE STOPPED OUTSIDE THE DOOR AN INSTANT AFTER THE GUARDSMAN DESCENDED IN HIS TURN
BUT I WILL NOT SWEAR TO IT SIRE YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH AND UNLESS A MAN BE ENDOWED WITH THAT ADMIRABLE INSTINCT
THE DOORS OF WHICH THEY CLOSED JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THEIR ENEMIES FROM ENTERING WITH THEM AS TO THE WOUNDED MAN HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN AT ONCE AND AS WE HAVE SAID IN A VERY BAD STATE
OF WHICH THE DOCTOR SAYS BAD THINGS
BUT D'ARTAGNAN WITH HIS GASCON IMAGINATION SAW IN IT HIS FUTURE FORTUNE AND PASSED THE NIGHT IN GOLDEN DREAMS
AS I SEE THERE IS NO CONCEALING ANYTHING FROM YOU YES I WAS EXPECTED AND VERY IMPATIENTLY I ACKNOWLEDGE
WHO WAS WAITING FOR THEM ALREADY INFORMED OF THIS FRESH DISTURBANCE
WAS BUSY GROOMING THEM AND HAD ALREADY FINISHED TWO
DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARD THE LOUVRE BUT TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE MUSKETEERS HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE KING HAD GONE STAG HUNTING IN THE FOREST OF SAINT GERMAIN
AT ALL EVENTS YOUNG MAN RELY UPON ONE WHO HAS BEEN THIRTY YEARS AT COURT DO NOT LULL YOURSELF IN SECURITY OR YOU WILL BE LOST BUT ON THE CONTRARY AND IT IS I WHO SAY IT SEE ENEMIES IN ALL DIRECTIONS IF ANYONE SEEKS A QUARREL WITH YOU
TO HIS EMINENCE THUS THE SOLDIERS OF OTHER COMPANIES THAN THOSE WHICH BELONGED TO THE RED DUKE AS ARAMIS HAD CALLED HIM OFTEN TOOK PART WITH THE KING'S MUSKETEERS IN THESE QUARRELS
THE DEVIL WHAT MUST I DO ABOVE ALL THINGS BE ALWAYS ON YOUR GUARD THE CARDINAL HAS A TENACIOUS MEMORY AND A LONG ARM YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT HE WILL REPAY YOU BY SOME ILL TURN BUT OF WHAT SORT
HE SALUTED THE KING RESPECTFULLY AND WITH THIS AGREEMENT TOOK LEAVE OF HIM THAT EVENING THE THREE MUSKETEERS WERE INFORMED OF THE HONOR ACCORDED THEM AS THEY HAD LONG BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE KING THEY WERE NOT MUCH EXCITED
WE ARE GOING AGAIN IT APPEARS TO HAVE OUR HIDES PIERCED IN ALL SORTS OF WAYS YOU WILL TAKE YOUR MUSKETOON AND YOUR PISTOLS
DOES NOT FIND SUCH STONES IN HIS MOTHER'S JEWEL CASE YOU THINK THEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO DREAD ASKED D'ARTAGNAN I MEAN TO SAY YOUNG MAN THAT HE WHO SLEEPS OVER A MINE THE MATCH OF WHICH IS ALREADY LIGHTED
SHUT HIS DOOR AND SET OFF AT A QUICK PACE IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION
MY DEAR PLANCHET I AM THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
GENTLEMEN I WILL SEE THE KING THIS EVENING BUT AS TO YOU I DO NOT ADVISE YOU TO RISK DOING SO THIS ADVICE WAS TOO REASONABLE AND MOREOVER CAME FROM A MAN WHO KNEW THE KING TOO WELL TO ALLOW THE FOUR YOUNG MEN TO DISPUTE IT
EXACTLY BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT LETTERS WHICH COME IN THIS WAY INTO SHUT UP HOUSES FALL FROM HEAVEN MY FRIEND FALL FROM HEAVEN
AND ALL THE FAULT IS WITH YOUR MUSKETEERS
AND A YOUTH NOT ONLY MAINTAINED THEIR GROUND AGAINST FIVE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE OF THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN BUT ABSOLUTELY BROUGHT FOUR OF THEM TO EARTH WHY THIS IS A VICTORY CRIED THE KING ALL RADIANT A COMPLETE VICTORY
YES SIRE AS THEY ALWAYS DO AND HOW DID THE THING HAPPEN LET US SEE FOR YOU KNOW MY DEAR CAPTAIN A JUDGE MUST HEAR BOTH SIDES GOOD LORD IN THE MOST SIMPLE AND NATURAL MANNER POSSIBLE
PERFECTLY DOES HE TALK WITH DIFFICULTY BUT HE CAN SPEAK
HIS AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBABLY LOST AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING NOW AS UPON THIS AUDIENCE IN HIS GASCON IMAGINATION DEPENDED HIS FUTURE LIFE HE SALUTED ARAMIS AND PORTHOS POLITELY
AND THE MOMENT THE TWO GUARDSMEN ATTACKED THEIR YOUNG COMPANION DROVE THEM BACK BERNAJOUX NOW FELL AND AS THE GUARDSMEN WERE ONLY TWO AGAINST FOUR THEY BEGAN TO CRY TO THE RESCUE
YOU'RE IN THE WRONG THERE FOR IF YOU KNEW MY NAME PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PRESSING WHAT IS YOUR NAME
BESIDES HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO AVOID A LITTLE CONDESCENSION TOWARD A HUSBAND WHOSE PRETTY WIFE HAS APPOINTED A MEETING WITH YOU THAT SAME EVENING AT SAINT CLOUD
AS HE PASSED THE HOTEL DES GARDES HE TOOK A GLANCE IN TO THE STABLES THREE OF THE FOUR HORSES HAD ALREADY ARRIVED
WHOM HE NEVER CEASED TO DESIGNATE DURING HIS ACCOUNT BY THE TITLE OF THE CARDINAL'S EXECUTIONER AND EXPATIATED AT GREAT LENGTH UPON THE BASTILLE THE BOLTS THE WICKETS THE DUNGEONS THE GRATINGS THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
WHERE MY FRIENDS STILL REMAIN AND YOU HAVE RETURNED HAVE YOU NOT
LEST ONE SHOULD GIVE WAY BENEATH YOU IF YOU PASS BEFORE A HOUSE WHICH IS BEING BUILT LOOK UP FOR FEAR A STONE SHOULD FALL UPON YOUR HEAD IF YOU STAY OUT LATE BE ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY YOUR LACKEY AND LET YOUR LACKEY BE ARMED IF
THE CARDINAL IS NOT THE MAN TO FORGET A MYSTIFICATION UNTIL HE HAS SETTLED ACCOUNT WITH THE MYSTIFIER AND THE MYSTIFIER APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE THE AIR OF BEING A CERTAIN YOUNG GASCON OF MY ACQUAINTANCE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CARDINAL IS AS WELL POSTED AS YOURSELF
LOOK AT ME AS LONG AS YOU LIKE MY LITTLE GENTLEMAN I HAVE SAID WHAT I HAVE SAID
THAT HIS EMINENCE'S GUARDSMEN HAD RECEIVED
IN ADDITION TO THE SWORD THRUST IN HIS ARM WHICH IS NOT DANGEROUS
SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU MY DEAR HOST SO MUCH THE WORSE WHEN I AM HAPPY I WISH ALL THE WORLD TO BE SO BUT IT APPEARS THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE THE YOUNG MAN DEPARTED LAUGHING AT THE JOKE WHICH HE THOUGHT HE ALONE COULD COMPREHEND AMUSE YOURSELF WELL REPLIED BONACIEUX
THAT IS TRUE SIRE THERE CAN BE NO MORE DOUBT ON THAT HEAD THEY CALLED UPON HIM THEN TO RETIRE BUT HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS A MUSKETEER AT HEART ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO YOUR MAJESTY
I'LL BE THEIR WARRANTY AND THAT IS THAT THEIR SWORDS MAY NEVER LEAVE THEIR SCABBARDS BUT IN YOUR MAJESTY'S SERVICE BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO DO
NOT ONLY AS GOOD COMRADES BUT AS MEN WHO HAD SO OFTEN HAD THEIR TURN THAT THEY COULD VERY WELL AFFORD HIM HIS
HE HOPED TO INTIMIDATE BUT D'ARTAGNAN HAD ON THE PRECEDING DAY SERVED HIS APPRENTICESHIP FRESH SHARPENED BY HIS VICTORY FULL OF HOPES OF FUTURE FAVOR HE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO RECOIL A STEP SO THE TWO SWORDS WERE CROSSED CLOSE TO THE HILTS
WELL THEN OFF TO THE NEAREST GOLDSMITH'S AND SELL THAT DIAMOND FOR THE HIGHEST PRICE YOU CAN GET FROM HIM HOWEVER MUCH OF A JEW HE MAY BE HE WILL GIVE YOU AT LEAST EIGHT HUNDRED PISTOLES PISTOLES HAVE NO NAME YOUNG MAN AND THAT RING HAS A TERRIBLE ONE
HE REPAIRED THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY TO HIS HOTEL AND CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE ANNOUNCED THE TWO NOBLES SALUTED EACH OTHER POLITELY FOR IF NO FRIENDSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN THEM THERE WAS AT LEAST ESTEEM BOTH WERE MEN OF COURAGE AND HONOR
WE FANCY THAT WE HAVE EACH CAUSE TO COMPLAIN OF THE OTHER AND I AM COME TO ENDEAVOR TO CLEAR UP THIS AFFAIR
HEAVED A PROFOUND SIGH AND SET TO WORK TO GROOM THE THIRD HORSE
HIS EYES THEREFORE WERE FIXED IN A SORT OF AGONY UPON THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH THE KING MUST ENTER
NEVER MIND BE CONTENT I WILL DO MY BEST ON GUARD BUT SAID HE WHOM D'ARTAGNAN THUS PROVOKED IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THIS PLACE IS BADLY CHOSEN AND THAT WE SHOULD BE BETTER
SHUN IT WERE IT WITH A CHILD OF TEN YEARS OLD IF YOU ARE ATTACKED BY DAY OR BY NIGHT FIGHT BUT RETREAT WITHOUT SHAME IF YOU CROSS A BRIDGE FEEL EVERY PLANK OF IT WITH YOUR FOOT
IT IS NOT NATURAL FOR LETTERS TO ENTER PEOPLE'S HOUSES IN THIS MANNER IF THE WINDOW HAD BEEN OPEN OR EVEN AJAR I SHOULD THINK NOTHING OF IT BUT NO ALL WAS HERMETICALLY SEALED
TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS TO THE RESCUE
THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME MAGIC UNDERNEATH MEANWHILE THE YOUNG MAN HAD DARTED IN TO HIS CHAMBER AND OPENED THE LETTER
FAR FROM HERE OH LORD NO ABOUT FORTY LEAGUES ONLY
THAT IS TRUE SAID THE KING BUT NEVER MIND TREVILLE COME STILL BY THE BACK STAIRCASE TREVILLE SMILED BUT AS IT WAS INDEED SOMETHING TO HAVE PREVAILED UPON THIS CHILD TO REBEL AGAINST HIS MASTER
BUT I LEAVE YOUR MAJESTY TO JUDGE WHAT FIVE ARMED MEN COULD POSSIBLY BE GOING TO DO IN SUCH A DESERTED PLACE AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD
BERNAJOUX WAS NOT A MAN TO HAVE SUCH A COMPLIMENT PAID TO HIM TWICE IN AN INSTANT HIS SWORD GLITTERED IN HIS HAND AND HE SPRANG UPON HIS ADVERSARY WHOM
THE DEVIL SAID D'ARTAGNAN
THE TRIUMPH OF THE QUEEN AND THE HUMILIATION OF HIS EMINENCE YOU MUST LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF WHAT HAVE I TO FEAR REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN AS LONG AS I SHALL HAVE THE LUCK TO ENJOY THE FAVOR OF THEIR MAJESTIES EVERYTHING BELIEVE ME
HE WAS DRESSED AS A CITIZEN THE GUARDS OF THE CARDINAL PERCEIVING HIS YOUTH AND THAT HE DID NOT BELONG TO THE CORPS INVITED HIM TO RETIRE BEFORE THEY ATTACKED SO YOU MAY PLAINLY SEE TREVILLE INTERRUPTED THE KING IT WAS THEY WHO ATTACKED
DO YOU KNOW THAT HIS EMINENCE HAS BEEN MAKING FRESH COMPLAINTS AGAINST YOUR MUSKETEERS
WHOM HE HAD SENT HOME TWO HOURS BEFORE FROM THE HOTEL DE VILLE TELLING HIM TO SIT UP FOR HIM OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM THE READER MAY ASK
HE WHO WOUNDED JUSSAC CRIED THE KING HE A BOY
D'ARTAGNAN'S INTENTION WAS TO GO OUT WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THE WORTHY MERCER BUT THE LATTER MADE SO POLITE AND FRIENDLY A SALUTATION THAT HIS TENANT FELT OBLIGED NOT ONLY TO STOP BUT TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM
RETURNED TO HIS HOTEL AND IMMEDIATELY SENT WORD TO THE FOUR FRIENDS THAT HE AWAITED THEIR COMPANY AT DINNER
WHO CERTAINLY DID NOT GO THERE IN SUCH A NUMEROUS COMPANY WITHOUT SOME ILL INTENTION AGAINST THE EDICTS AH AH YOU INCLINE ME TO THINK SO SAID THE KING THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WENT THITHER TO FIGHT THEMSELVES I DO NOT ACCUSE THEM SIRE
THEY SUCCEEDED IN CALMING THEIR FRIENDS WHO CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH HURLING SOME PAVING STONES AGAINST THE GATES BUT THE GATES WERE TOO STRONG THEY SOON TIRED OF THE SPORT BESIDES THOSE WHO MUST BE CONSIDERED THE LEADERS OF THE ENTERPRISE HAD QUIT THE GROUP AND WERE MAKING THEIR WAY
AND AS HE DECLARED HE WAS TOO IGNORANT OF THE GAME TO PLAY IT REGULARLY THEY ONLY CONTINUED GIVING BALLS TO ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT COUNTING
AND THE TWO WILL PASS OFF TOGETHER
WHICH WAS FIXED FOR MIDDAY HE CAST HIS EYES AROUND AND SEEING THAT THE STREET WAS EMPTY SAID TO HIS ADVERSARY MY FAITH IT IS FORTUNATE FOR YOU ALTHOUGH YOUR NAME IS BERNAJOUX TO HAVE ONLY TO DEAL WITH AN APPRENTICE MUSKETEER
SHALL I GIVE YOU COUNSEL GOOD COUNSEL THE COUNSEL OF A FRIEND
AH LIKE THE CHARMING JOURNEY THE OTHER DAY
WOULD NOT ONE SAY HE WAS SPEAKING OF A RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY IN TRUTH MY DEAR CAPTAIN
D'ARTAGNAN FOUND THE MUSKETEER DRESSED AND READY TO GO OUT AS THE HOUR TO WAIT UPON THE KING WAS NOT TILL TWELVE HE HAD MADE A PARTY WITH PORTHOS AND ARAMIS TO PLAY A GAME AT TENNIS
WHY IT IS INDEED A TRUE ROYAL JEWEL
IT IS USELESS TO LET THE CARDINAL KNOW YES SIRE YOU UNDERSTAND TREVILLE AN EDICT IS STILL AN EDICT IT IS FORBIDDEN TO FIGHT AFTER ALL BUT THIS ENCOUNTER SIRE IS QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF A DUEL IT IS A BRAWL
AND ALTHOUGH IGNORANT OF THE GAME WHICH HE HAD NEVER PLAYED HE ACCEPTED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIS TIME FROM NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AS IT THEN SCARCELY WAS TILL TWELVE THE TWO MUSKETEERS WERE ALREADY THERE AND WERE PLAYING TOGETHER
BY THE BY YOU CAN BE SURE OF YOUR LACKEY MISTRUST EVERYBODY YOUR FRIEND YOUR BROTHER YOUR MISTRESS YOUR MISTRESS ABOVE ALL D'ARTAGNAN BLUSHED MY MISTRESS ABOVE ALL REPEATED HE MECHANICALLY
PERHAPS THERE IS BUT ONE AT THIS MOMENT BUT BY THIS EVENING THERE WILL BE FOUR IT APPEARS THAT OUR JOURNEY WAS A REMOUNTING JOURNEY THEN EXACTLY SO SAID D'ARTAGNAN AND NODDING TO PLANCHET HE WENT OUT
AH I HAD EIGHTY LOUIS BEFORE ME PUT DOWN THE SAME SUM SO THAT THEY WHO HAVE LOST MAY HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF JUSTICE BEFORE EVERYTHING
IT IS WOMAN WHO HAS RUINED US STILL RUINS US AND WILL RUIN US AS LONG AS THE WORLD STANDS TAKE MY ADVICE AND SET OUT THIS EVENING
YOU ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE SCRIPTURES
ONE HARDLY A YOUNG MAN BUT WHO HOWEVER BEHAVED HIMSELF SO ADMIRABLY ON THIS OCCASION THAT I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF RECOMMENDING HIM TO YOUR MAJESTY HOW DOES HE CALL HIMSELF D'ARTAGNAN SIRE
LEST IT BE OBSERVED THAT WE GO OUT TOGETHER YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT FOR OUR UNDERTAKING COMPANY WOULD BE IN THE WAY THAT'S TRUE SAID THE GUARDSMAN ASTONISHED THAT HIS NAME HAD NOT PRODUCED MORE EFFECT UPON THE YOUNG MAN
HE IS THE SON OF ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS THE SON OF A MAN WHO SERVED UNDER THE KING YOUR FATHER OF GLORIOUS MEMORY IN THE CIVIL WAR AND YOU SAY THIS YOUNG MAN BEHAVED HIMSELF WELL TELL ME HOW TREVILLE YOU KNOW HOW I DELIGHT IN ACCOUNTS OF WAR AND FIGHTING
WHO HASTENED TO THE SUCCOR OF THEIR COMRADES THE MELEE BECAME GENERAL BUT STRENGTH WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE MUSKETEERS
THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY FELL UPON THE INCARCERATION OF THE POOR MAN
OH THE WOMEN THE WOMEN CRIED THE OLD SOLDIER I KNOW THEM BY THEIR ROMANTIC IMAGINATION EVERYTHING THAT SAVORS OF MYSTERY CHARMS THEM SO YOU HAVE SEEN THE ARM THAT WAS ALL YOU WOULD MEET THE QUEEN AND SHE WOULD NOT KNOW WHO YOU ARE
DETAINED BY AN ACCUSATION OF COINING
HE FOUND THE DOOR OF HIS PASSAGE OPEN SPRANG UP THE STAIRS AND KNOCKED SOFTLY IN A MANNER AGREED UPON BETWEEN HIM AND HIS LACKEY
HE HAD RETIRED AT ONE O'CLOCK UNDER THE PRETENSE OF BEING INDISPOSED AS TO THEIR MAJESTIES THEY DID NOT RETURN TO THE LOUVRE TILL SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING NOW SAID TREVILLE LOWERING HIS VOICE AND LOOKING INTO EVERY CORNER OF THE APARTMENT TO SEE IF THEY WERE ALONE
I FOUND A LETTER ON THE GREEN TABLE COVER IN YOUR BEDROOM AND WHERE IS THAT LETTER
PLACED BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AS BERNAJOUX WAS HE HAD NO IDEA FOR A MOMENT OF CONCEALING THE TRUTH AND HE DESCRIBED TO THE TWO NOBLES THE AFFAIR EXACTLY AS IT HAD PASSED
WHICH SEIZE ME ALL AT ONCE AND I HAVE JUST FELT A COLD SHIVER PAY NO ATTENTION TO IT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO OCCUPY YOURSELF WITH BUT BEING HAPPY THEN I HAVE FULL OCCUPATION FOR I AM SO NOT YET WAIT A LITTLE THIS EVENING YOU SAID WELL
AT LENGTH HE WENT TO BED FELL ASLEEP AND HAD GOLDEN DREAMS
SO TRIFLING INDEED THAT D'ARTAGNAN DID NOT PERCEIVE IT ANY MORE THAN HE HAD THE MOMENTARY SHADE WHICH AN INSTANT BEFORE HAD DARKENED THE COUNTENANCE OF THE WORTHY MAN AH MAY YOU BE A TRUE PROPHET SAID D'ARTAGNAN LAUGHING NO
AND YOU FOUND IT TRAITOROUS MONSIEUR INDEED
WHICH THE LIBERALITY OF D'ARTAGNAN HAD NOT ENTIRELY EFFACED LEFT ALONE D'ARTAGNAN READ AND REREAD HIS BILLET THEN HE KISSED AND REKISSED TWENTY TIMES THE LINES TRACED BY THE HAND OF HIS BEAUTIFUL MISTRESS
DOMESTICS IN DARING TO MAKE A SORTIE UPON THE KING'S MUSKETEERS THE PROPOSITION HAD BEEN MADE AND RECEIVED WITH ENTHUSIASM WHEN FORTUNATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK
IS ONLY THAT I MAY KNOW WHETHER I AM DELAYING YOU WHY THAT QUESTION MY DEAR HOST ASKED D'ARTAGNAN DO YOU INTEND TO SIT UP FOR ME NO BUT SINCE MY ARREST AND THE ROBBERY THAT WAS COMMITTED IN MY HOUSE I AM ALARMED EVERY TIME I HEAR A DOOR OPEN
LA VIEUVILLE SAID HE TAKE MY PLACE
WHICH MAY BETRAY HIM WHO WEARS IT SELL THIS RING A RING WHICH COMES FROM MY SOVEREIGN NEVER SAID D'ARTAGNAN THEN AT LEAST TURN THE GEM INSIDE YOU SILLY FELLOW FOR EVERYBODY MUST BE AWARE THAT A CADET FROM GASCONY
HAS HE NOT ALL THE TRICKS OF A DEMON AT HIS COMMAND THE LEAST THAT CAN BE EXPECTED IS THAT YOU WILL BE ARRESTED WHAT WILL THEY DARE TO ARREST A MAN IN HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE PARDIEU
BEWARE OF THE ENEMY WHO MAKES YOU PRESENTS
HER MAJESTY DID ME THE HONOR TO GRANT ME THAT FAVOR AND THAT IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES IMPRUDENT THRICE IMPRUDENT
I PREFER TRAVELING ALONE TO HAVING A COMPANION WHO ENTERTAINS THE LEAST FEAR
AH THAT'S QUITE ANOTHER THING BUT PROMISE ME IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE KILLED TONIGHT THAT YOU WILL GO TOMORROW I PROMISE IT DO YOU NEED MONEY
AND WHO HAVE I DARE AFFIRM TO THE KING HIS SERVICE MUCH AT HEART THREE OF MY BEST SOLDIERS I SAY
TWO OR THREE TIMES BAH PREOCCUPIED AS MONSIEUR WAS WITH THE LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED HE DID NOT OBSERVE THAT BUT I WHOM THE STRANGE FASHION IN WHICH THAT LETTER CAME INTO THE HOUSE HAD PLACED ON MY GUARD I DID NOT LOSE A MOVEMENT OF HIS FEATURES
PASSED SO CLOSE TO D'ARTAGNAN'S FACE
NOT TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL I AM ABOUT TO MAKE TO YOU
AH THESE MUSKETEERS OF YOURS ARE VERY DEVILS FELLOWS TO BE HANGED NO SIRE REPLIED TREVILLE WHO SAW AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOW THINGS WOULD GO ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE GOOD CREATURES AS MEEK AS LAMBS AND HAVE BUT ONE DESIRE
THEN AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A MORE REASONABLE PROPOSAL HE AGREED TO IT BOTH DESCENDED TO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE WOUNDED MAN LAY THE LATTER ON SEEING THESE TWO NOBLE LORDS WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM ENDEAVORED TO RAISE HIMSELF UP IN HIS BED
LET US ADJURE HIM IN THE NAME OF THE GOD BEFORE WHOM HE MUST PERHAPS APPEAR TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
HAD MADE A PARTY OF PLEASURE WITH A YOUNG FELLOW FROM GASCONY WHOM I HAD INTRODUCED TO THEM THE SAME MORNING THE PARTY WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT SAINT GERMAIN I BELIEVE AND THEY HAD APPOINTED TO MEET AT THE CARMES DESCHAUX WHEN THEY WERE DISTURBED BY DE JUSSAC CAHUSAC
THAT D'ARTAGNAN COULD NOT HELP PERCEIVING IT AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER
WITH A LETTER IN WHICH HE BEGGED OF HIM TO EJECT THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN FROM HIS HOUSE AND TO REPRIMAND HIS PEOPLE FOR THEIR AUDACITY IN MAKING SORTIE AGAINST THE KING'S MUSKETEERS
WELL THEN I COUNT ON YOU AT THE APPOINTED HOUR I SHALL BE READY
THIS EVENING WILL COME THANK GOD AND PERHAPS YOU LOOK FOR IT WITH AS MUCH IMPATIENCE AS I DO PERHAPS THIS EVENING MADAME BONACIEUX WILL VISIT THE CONJUGAL DOMICILE
AND PRESSING HIM WARMLY WITHOUT DOUBT WOULD SOON HAVE COMPLETED HIS WORK WITH A THIRD BLOW WHEN THE NOISE WHICH AROSE FROM THE STREET BEING HEARD IN THE TENNIS COURT TWO OF THE FRIENDS OF THE GUARDSMAN WHO HAD SEEN HIM GO OUT AFTER EXCHANGING SOME WORDS WITH D'ARTAGNAN RUSHED SWORD IN HAND FROM THE COURT AND FELL UPON THE CONQUEROR
D'ARTAGNAN LISTENED TO HIM WITH EXEMPLARY COMPLAISANCE AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SAID AND MADAME BONACIEUX DO YOU KNOW WHO CARRIED HER OFF FOR I DO NOT FORGET THAT I OWE TO THAT UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF HAVING MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
AH YOUNG MAN YOUNG MAN SOME FLIRTATION OR OTHER
WHEN HE WAS LEFT STIFF AS A RUSH IN LONDON IN THE INTERVENING TIME BUCKINGHAM PERHAPS SENT HIM TO PARIS AS HE DID THE HORSES HAS ANYONE BROUGHT A LETTER FOR ME ASKED D'ARTAGNAN EAGERLY
BUT WHY THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WHILE YOU WERE TALKING WITH HIM I WATCHED YOU WITHOUT LISTENING TO YOU
DID NOT INSPIRE HIM WITH THE LEAST SUSPICION OF HIS PRETTY HOSTESS
YOU ARE RIGHT TREVILLE BUT THEY WERE NOT ALONE YOUR MUSKETEERS THEY HAD A YOUTH WITH THEM YES SIRE AND ONE WOUNDED MAN SO THAT THREE OF THE KING'S MUSKETEERS ONE OF WHOM WAS WOUNDED
ARE THERE NOT SOME LATIN VERSES UPON THAT SUBJECT STOP YES DOUBTLESS REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN
NEITHER OF THEM HAD RETURNED THEIR LACKEYS LIKEWISE WERE ABSENT AND NOTHING HAD BEEN HEARD OF EITHER THE ONE OR THE OTHER
HIS VISIT OF THE DAY BEFORE IT IS TO BE REMEMBERED HAD BEEN VERY SHORT AND VERY LITTLE EXPLICATIVE HE FOUND TREVILLE IN A JOYFUL MOOD HE HAD THOUGHT THE KING AND QUEEN CHARMING AT THE BALL IT IS TRUE THE CARDINAL HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY ILL TEMPERED
REQUIRED THIS INTELLIGENCE TO BE REPEATED TO HIM TWICE AND EACH TIME HIS COMPANIONS SAW HIS BROW BECOME DARKER HAD HIS MAJESTY ASKED HE ANY INTENTION OF HOLDING THIS HUNTING PARTY YESTERDAY NO YOUR EXCELLENCY
AND BY AND BY BY AND BY WE WILL SEE AH SIRE IT IS BECAUSE I CONFIDE IN THAT JUSTICE THAT I SHALL WAIT PATIENTLY AND QUIETLY THE GOOD PLEASURE OF YOUR MAJESTY
I AM GOING OUT FOR ALL DAY PERHAPS YOU ARE THEREFORE YOUR OWN MASTER TILL SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING BUT AT SEVEN O'CLOCK YOU MUST HOLD YOURSELF IN READINESS WITH TWO HORSES
DECLARING THAT HE WOULD NOT RESUME THE GAME UNTIL HE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO PLAY WITH THEM ON MORE EQUAL TERMS
AND WE ARE GOING TO BE RECOMPENSED FOR OUR DILIGENCE CONTINUED THE MERCER
AND KNOWS THAT I HAVE BEEN TO LONDON THE DEVIL YOU HAVE BEEN TO LONDON WAS IT FROM LONDON YOU BROUGHT THAT BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND THAT GLITTERS ON YOUR FINGER BEWARE MY DEAR D'ARTAGNAN A PRESENT FROM AN ENEMY IS NOT A GOOD THING
THEN UPON SEEING MY MUSKETEERS THEY CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND FORGOT THEIR PRIVATE HATRED FOR PARTISAN HATRED FOR YOUR MAJESTY CANNOT BE IGNORANT THAT THE MUSKETEERS WHO BELONG TO THE KING AND NOBODY BUT THE KING
RETURNING ABOARD HE HAD STEPPED ON TO HIS OWN DECK AGAIN THERE MEMORY ABRUPTLY AND INEXPLICABLY CEASED HE WAS BEGINNING TO TORTURE HIS MIND WITH CONJECTURE

IT NEED HARDLY BE SAID THAT THE REVELATIONS THEY HAVE CLAIMED TO RECEIVE HAVE BEEN THUS FAR WITHOUT ELEMENT OF BENEFIT TO THE HUMAN RACE THE EVOLUTION THEORY

ASSERTING THE GENERAL FACT OF PROGRESS IN NATURE THE EVOLUTION THEORY SHOWS THAT THE METHOD OF THIS PROGRESS HAS BEEN ONE BY THE MULTIPLICATION OF ORGANS AND FUNCTIONS TWO
SINCE THE CHRISTIAN ERA WE MAY CLASS AMONG THEOSOPHISTS SUCH SECTS AS NEO PLATONISTS THE HESYCHASTS OF THE GREEK CHURCH THE MYSTICS OF MEDIAEVAL TIMES AND IN LATER TIMES THE DISCIPLES OF PARACELSUS
ACCEPT THE TRUTHS OF RECORDED REVELATION AS IMMUTABLE BUT AS SUBJECT TO MODIFICATION BY LATER AND PERSONAL REVELATIONS THE THEOSOPHICAL IDEA HAS HAD FOLLOWERS FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES

A BROAD SPACE BETWEEN THE TEETH INDICATES A LIAR
AND WITH LANGUID EYES IN ACHING HEAD HE LOOKED ROUND THE CABIN WHICH WAS FLOODED WITH SUNLIGHT FROM THE SQUARE WINDOWS ASTERN THEN HE UTTERED A MOAN AND CLOSED HIS EYES AGAIN IMPELLED TO THIS BY THE MONSTROUS ACHE IN HIS HEAD

NOT AS A CHECK BUT AS A GUIDE TO HIM THEY FELL INTO HIS WHILE HER ARMS EXTENDED BUT NOT RIGID KEPT HIM FAR ENOUGH OFF TO LET HER SURRENDERED FACE SAY THE REST THEY MAY HAVE STOOD IN THAT WAY FOR A LONG TIME
AT LENGTH SHE SAID I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE THE CONFESSION MORE DISPASSIONATELY
TO PICTURE HER BLAMELESS LIFE LED IN THE STAGE SETTING OF ADULTERY BUT HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITH CONSIDERABLE ADMIRATION THAT IF A LOVER HAD BEEN WHAT SHE WANTED THE INTREPID WOMAN WOULD HAVE HAD HIM TOO
THEN EVERYTHING I CAME HOME FOR EVERYTHING THAT MADE MY OTHER LIFE SEEM BY CONTRAST SO BARE AND SO POOR BECAUSE NO ONE THERE TOOK ACCOUNT OF THEM ALL THESE THINGS ARE A SHAM OR A DREAM
SINGLE ITEM TO THE MENU OF HER SUPPERS SHE DID NOT SUFFER FROM HER GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION THE IMMENSE ACCRETION OF FLESH WHICH HAD DESCENDED ON HER IN MIDDLE LIFE LIKE A FLOOD OF LAVA ON A DOOMED CITY
FOR THAT'S THE THING WE'VE ALWAYS GOT TO THINK OF HAVEN'T WE BY YOUR OWN SHOWING SHE INSISTED MY OWN SHOWING HE ECHOED HIS BLANK EYES STILL ON THE SEA
AND THE YOUNG MAN HIMSELF MENTALLY ADDED AND SHE OUGHT TO KNOW THAT A MAN WHO'S JUST ENGAGED DOESN'T SPEND HIS TIME CALLING ON MARRIED WOMEN
AND ALSO TO HAVE A LITTLE CANVASBACK SHOOTING AT TREVENNA MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN PAUSED AGAIN AND CONTINUED WITH INCREASING BENEVOLENCE BEFORE TAKING HIM DOWN TO MARYLAND WE ARE INVITING A FEW FRIENDS TO MEET HIM HERE ONLY A LITTLE DINNER
AND OUT AT THE BARE BEACH AND THE ROW OF STARK WHITE VILLAGE HOUSES STRUNG ALONG THE SHORE WE'RE DAMNABLY DULL
BUT STILL HE MADE NO EFFORT TO DRAW NEARER HE HAD KNOWN THE LOVE THAT IS FED ON CARESSES AND FEEDS THEM
ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF NEWLAND'S ENGAGEMENT YOU AND HENRY OUGHT TO KNOW AH SAID MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN DRAWING A DEEP BREATH THERE WAS A SILENCE DURING WHICH
AND THE BEAUTIFUL OLD CARVED FRAME OF GAINSBOROUGH'S LADY ANGELICA DU LAC MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S PORTRAIT BY HUNTINGTON IN BLACK VELVET AND VENETIAN POINT
THE FRIVOLOUS UPHOLSTERY OF THE SECOND EMPIRE
AND BEAUFORT DO YOU SAY THESE THINGS TO BEAUFORT HE ASKED ABRUPTLY
OH MISSUS WELLAND MURMURED WHILE THE YOUNG MAN SMILING AT HIS BETROTHED REPLIED AS SOON AS EVER IT CAN IF ONLY YOU'LL BACK ME UP MISSUS MINGOTT WE MUST GIVE THEM TIME TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BETTER MAMMA
OR ONLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS BUT IT WAS LONG ENOUGH FOR HER SILENCE TO COMMUNICATE ALL SHE HAD TO SAY AND FOR HIM TO FEEL THAT ONLY ONE THING MATTERED HE MUST DO NOTHING
WITH TWO TINY WHITE HANDS POISED LIKE GULLS ON THE SURFACE OF THE BILLOWS THE BURDEN OF MISSUS MANSON MINGOTT'S FLESH HAD LONG SINCE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO GO UP AND DOWN STAIRS
I'M THE MAN WHO MARRIED ONE WOMAN BECAUSE ANOTHER ONE TOLD HIM TO HER PALENESS TURNED TO A FUGITIVE FLUSH I THOUGHT YOU PROMISED YOU WERE NOT TO SAY SUCH THINGS TODAY
I HEAR HE'S BEEN STAYING WITH YOU AT THE BLENKERS SHE SMILED OH THE CARVER DANGER IS OVER DOCTOR CARVER IS A VERY CLEVER MAN HE WANTS A RICH WIFE TO FINANCE HIS PLANS
AND WITH CHARACTERISTIC INDEPENDENCE SHE HAD MADE HER RECEPTION ROOMS UPSTAIRS AND ESTABLISHED HERSELF IN FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF ALL THE NEW YORK PROPRIETIES ON THE GROUND FLOOR OF HER HOUSE
THOSE WERE OF THE PUREST EIGHTEEN THIRTY WITH A GRIM HARMONY OF CABBAGE ROSE GARLANDED CARPETS ROSEWOOD CONSOLES ROUND ARCHED FIRE PLACES
WHICH ON A DAY OF SUCH GLARING SUNLIGHT AND AT THE SHOPPING HOUR SEEMED IN ITSELF AN INDELICATE THING FOR A COMPROMISED WOMAN TO DO BUT AT ANY RATE IT SPARED THEM THE EMBARRASSMENT OF HER PRESENCE
INVITING THE COUNTESS OLENSKA TO THE DINNER WHICH THE VAN DER LUYDENS WERE GIVING THE FOLLOWING WEEK FOR THEIR COUSIN THE DUKE OF SAINT AUSTREY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEN IN THE CLUB BOX EXCHANGED A SMILE AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
I HAD HER ORDERS TO TELL YOU THAT WE WERE ENGAGED BUT I COULDN'T IN THAT CROWD THE SMILE PASSED FROM COUNTESS OLENSKA'S EYES TO HER LIPS SHE LOOKED YOUNGER MORE LIKE THE BOLD BROWN ELLEN MINGOTT OF HIS BOYHOOD
BUT THIS PASSION THAT WAS CLOSER THAN HIS BONES WAS NOT TO BE SUPERFICIALLY SATISFIED HIS ONE TERROR WAS TO DO ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT EFFACE THE SOUND AND IMPRESSION OF HER WORDS HIS ONE THOUGHT
THE VAN DER LUYDENS WERE MORBIDLY SENSITIVE TO ANY CRITICISM OF THEIR SECLUDED EXISTENCE THEY WERE THE ARBITERS OF FASHION THE COURT OF LAST APPEAL AND THEY KNEW IT AND BOWED TO THEIR FATE
AS STATELY AS HER OWN PERHAPS FOR SHE WAS AN IMPARTIAL WOMAN EVEN STATELIER AND THAT THE COBBLE STONES OVER WHICH THE OLD CLATTERING OMNIBUSES BUMPED WOULD BE REPLACED BY SMOOTH ASPHALT
BUT BEING SHY AND RETIRING PERSONS WITH NO NATURAL INCLINATION FOR THEIR PART THEY LIVED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN THE SYLVAN SOLITUDE OF SKUYTERCLIFF AND WHEN THEY CAME TO TOWN DECLINED ALL INVITATIONS
I THINK MY UNCLE EGMONT USED TO SAY HE FOUND IT LESS AGITATING NOT TO READ THE MORNING PAPERS TILL AFTER DINNER SAID MISSUS ARCHER RESPONSIVELY YES MY GOOD FATHER ABHORRED HURRY
HE UNDERSTOOD IT AS CLEARLY AS IF SHE HAD UTTERED THE WORDS AND THE THOUGHT KEPT HIM ANCHORED TO HIS SIDE OF THE TABLE IN A KIND OF MOVED AND SACRED SUBMISSION WHAT A LIFE FOR YOU HE GROANED
OVERWHELMED BY WHAT IT SUDDENLY TOLD HIM YOU TOO OH ALL THIS TIME YOU TOO
AS IF WATCHING CALMLY FOR LIFE AND FASHION TO FLOW NORTHWARD TO HER SOLITARY DOORS SHE SEEMED IN NO HURRY TO HAVE THEM COME FOR HER PATIENCE WAS EQUALLED BY HER CONFIDENCE SHE WAS SURE THAT
ON THE PLEA OF MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S HEALTH NEWLAND ARCHER CAME TO HIS MOTHER'S RESCUE EVERYBODY IN NEW YORK KNOWS WHAT YOU AND COUSIN LOUISA REPRESENT THAT'S WHY MISSUS MINGOTT FELT
MISSUS WELLAND INTERPOSED WITH THE PROPER AFFECTATION OF RELUCTANCE TO WHICH THE ANCESTRESS REJOINED KNOW EACH OTHER FIDDLESTICKS EVERYBODY IN NEW YORK HAS ALWAYS KNOWN EVERYBODY
AND IMMENSE GLAZED BOOK CASES OF MAHOGANY WHEREAS OLD MISSUS MINGOTT WHO HAD BUILT HER HOUSE LATER HAD BODILY CAST OUT THE MASSIVE FURNITURE OF HER PRIME AND MINGLED WITH THE MINGOTT HEIRLOOMS
COUCHED IN THE SAME LANGUAGE AS HIS WIFE'S AND SEATED HIMSELF IN ONE OF THE BROCADE ARMCHAIRS WITH THE SIMPLICITY OF A REIGNING SOVEREIGN I HAD JUST FINISHED READING THE TIMES HE SAID
OR IF NOT SHE CONTINUED PURSUING HER OWN THOUGHT WITH A PAINFUL APPLICATION IF IT'S NOT WORTH WHILE TO HAVE GIVEN UP TO HAVE MISSED THINGS SO THAT OTHERS MAY BE SAVED FROM DISILLUSIONMENT AND MISERY
WHICH RECALLED SCENES IN FRENCH FICTION AND ARCHITECTURAL INCENTIVES TO IMMORALITY SUCH AS THE SIMPLE AMERICAN HAD NEVER DREAMED OF THAT WAS HOW WOMEN WITH LOVERS LIVED IN THE WICKED OLD SOCIETIES
MISSUS HENRY VAN DER LUYDEN LISTENED IN SILENCE TO HER COUSIN MISSUS ARCHER'S NARRATIVE IT WAS ALL VERY WELL TO TELL YOURSELF IN ADVANCE THAT MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN WAS ALWAYS SILENT AND THAT
AND PROCEEDED TO REHEARSE ONCE MORE THE MONSTROUS TALE OF THE AFFRONT INFLICTED ON MISSUS LOVELL MINGOTT OF COURSE SHE ENDED AUGUSTA WELLAND AND MARY MINGOTT BOTH FELT THAT
THE MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN WHO SAT BENEATH IT LISTENING TO MISSUS ARCHER MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE TWIN SISTER OF THE FAIR AND STILL YOUNGISH WOMAN DROOPING AGAINST A GILT ARMCHAIR BEFORE A GREEN REP CURTAIN
I'M CERTAIN OF IT SIR LARRY HAS BEEN GOING IT RATHER HARDER THAN USUAL LATELY IF COUSIN LOUISA WON'T MIND MY MENTIONING IT
SUCH AS PEOPLE REPORTED HAVING SEEN IN PARIS MEANWHILE AS EVERY ONE SHE CARED TO SEE CAME TO HER AND SHE COULD FILL HER ROOMS AS EASILY AS THE BEAUFORTS AND WITHOUT ADDING A
AS HAVING AN ALMOST SACERDOTAL IMPORTANCE HER PROMPTNESS OF ACTION SHOWED THAT SHE CONSIDERED THE CASE AS PRESSING AS MISSUS ARCHER BUT LEST SHE SHOULD BE THOUGHT TO HAVE COMMITTED HERSELF IN ADVANCE
SHE ADDED WITH THE SWEETEST LOOK HENRY ALWAYS ENJOYS SEEING YOU DEAR ADELINE AND HE WILL WISH TO CONGRATULATE NEWLAND THE DOUBLE DOORS HAD SOLEMNLY REOPENED
WHO HAD WORN OUT THE PATIENCE OF ALL HER OTHER RELATIONS JUST AT THE TIME WHEN SHE MOST NEEDED LOOKING AFTER AND PROTECTING FROM MATRIMONIAL PERILS BUT DOCTOR CARVER AREN'T YOU AFRAID OF DOCTOR CARVER
FACED THAT OF HER LOVELY ANCESTRESS IT WAS GENERALLY CONSIDERED AS FINE AS A CABANEL AND THOUGH TWENTY YEARS HAD ELAPSED SINCE ITS EXECUTION WAS STILL A PERFECT LIKENESS INDEED
AND SHE WAVED ONE OF HER TINY HANDS WITH SMALL POINTED NAILS AND ROLLS OF AGED FAT ENCIRCLING THE WRIST LIKE IVORY BRACELETS MINE WAS MODELLED IN ROME BY THE GREAT FERRIGIANI
AND NEITHER MADE ANY SHOW OF MOVING ARCHER WAS CONSCIOUS OF A CURIOUS INDIFFERENCE TO HER BODILY PRESENCE HE WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AWARE OF IT IF ONE OF THE HANDS SHE HAD FLUNG OUT ON THE TABLE HAD NOT DRAWN HIS GAZE
IN THE COURSE OF THE NEXT DAY THE FIRST OF THE USUAL BETROTHAL VISITS WERE EXCHANGED THE NEW YORK RITUAL WAS PRECISE AND INFLEXIBLE IN SUCH MATTERS
NOW I'VE GOT YOU I WANT A GOOD GOSSIP I HEAR YOUR BALL WAS MAGNIFICENT AND I UNDERSTAND YOU INVITED MISSUS LEMUEL STRUTHERS WELL I'VE A CURIOSITY TO SEE THE WOMAN MYSELF SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HER RELATIVES
SOMEBODY ELSE'S TRADITION THAT I SEE AMONG OUR OWN FRIENDS IT SEEMS STUPID TO HAVE DISCOVERED AMERICA ONLY TO MAKE IT INTO A COPY OF ANOTHER COUNTRY SHE SMILED ACROSS THE TABLE
BUT NOW WE LIVE IN A CONSTANT RUSH SAID MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN IN MEASURED TONES LOOKING WITH PLEASANT DELIBERATION ABOUT THE LARGE SHROUDED ROOM WHICH TO ARCHER WAS SO COMPLETE AN IMAGE OF ITS OWNERS
YET SO CHAINED TO THEIR SEPARATE DESTINIES THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE BEEN HALF THE WORLD APART
VERY HANDSOME SHE ADDED RETURNING THE JEWEL VERY LIBERAL IN MY TIME A CAMEO SET IN PEARLS WAS THOUGHT SUFFICIENT BUT IT'S THE HAND THAT SETS OFF THE RING ISN'T IT MY DEAR MISTER ARCHER
CRYING OUT TO HER BENEATH HIS WORDS SHE SAT MOTIONLESS WITH LOWERED LIDS OH I SHAN'T GO YET NOT YET
I WON'T GO BACK SHE SAID AND TURNING AWAY SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND LED THE WAY INTO THE PUBLIC DINING ROOM THE STRIDENT SCHOOL TEACHERS
HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AGAIN THEIR PALE EYES CLUNG TOGETHER IN PROLONGED AND SERIOUS CONSULTATION THEN A FAINT SMILE
BUT ALWAYS APPEARED TO INCLINE TO CLEMENCY TILL HER THIN LIPS WAVERING INTO THE SHADOW OF A SMILE MADE THE ALMOST INVARIABLE REPLY I SHALL FIRST HAVE TO TALK THIS OVER WITH MY HUSBAND
I PROMISE YOU NOT AS LONG AS YOU HOLD OUT
THAN WHEN THE PORTRAIT HAD BEEN PAINTED SHE ALWAYS INDEED STRUCK NEWLAND ARCHER AS HAVING BEEN RATHER GRUESOMELY PRESERVED IN THE AIRLESS ATMOSPHERE OF A PERFECTLY IRREPROACHABLE EXISTENCE AS BODIES CAUGHT IN GLACIERS
AH HOW LIKE A WOMAN NONE OF YOU WILL EVER SEE A BAD BUSINESS THROUGH SHE LOWERED HER VOICE IS IT A BAD BUSINESS FOR MAY
EVER SEPARATED THEMSELVES ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING AS CONTROVERSIAL AS A TALKING OVER BUT AS NEITHER HAD EVER REACHED A DECISION WITHOUT PREFACING IT BY THIS MYSTERIOUS CONCLAVE MISSUS ARCHER AND HER SON
TALKS AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE ABOUT THE IMPERTINENCE OF INVITING HIS WIFE TO MEET PEOPLE HE DOESN'T WISH HER TO KNOW HE'S SIMPLY USING MADAME OLENSKA AS A LIGHTNING ROD I'VE SEEN HIM TRY THE SAME THING OFTEN BEFORE THE LEFFERTSES
AND MEDORA IS SIMPLY A GOOD ADVERTISEMENT AS A CONVERT A CONVERT TO WHAT TO ALL SORTS OF NEW AND CRAZY SOCIAL SCHEMES BUT DO YOU KNOW THEY INTEREST ME MORE THAN THE BLIND CONFORMITY TO TRADITION
HE DROPPED INTO HIS CHAIR WHAT HER ANSWER REALLY SAID WAS IF YOU LIFT A FINGER YOU'LL DRIVE ME BACK BACK TO ALL THE ABOMINATIONS YOU KNOW OF AND ALL THE TEMPTATIONS YOU HALF GUESS
WERE MERELY PALE GREY INSTEAD OF PALE BLUE MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN GREETED MISSUS ARCHER WITH COUSINLY AFFABILITY PROFFERED TO NEWLAND LOW VOICED CONGRATULATIONS
MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN STILL WORE BLACK VELVET AND VENETIAN POINT WHEN SHE WENT INTO SOCIETY OR RATHER SINCE SHE NEVER DINED OUT WHEN SHE THREW OPEN HER OWN DOORS TO RECEIVE IT HER FAIR HAIR
SHE AND MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN WERE SO EXACTLY ALIKE THAT ARCHER OFTEN WONDERED HOW AFTER FORTY YEARS OF THE CLOSEST CONJUGALITY TWO SUCH MERGED IDENTITIES
THEY NEVER DO ANYTHING ELSE AND IN SPITE OF THE COSMOPOLITAN VIEWS ON WHICH HE PRIDED HIMSELF HE THANKED HEAVEN THAT HE WAS A NEW YORKER
AND THAT EVENING AT THE OPERA MISTER SILLERTON JACKSON WAS ABLE TO STATE THAT
AND SO SHE HAD DECIDED TO TRY WASHINGTON WHERE ONE WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET MORE VARIETIES OF PEOPLE AND OF OPINION AND ON THE WHOLE SHE SHOULD PROBABLY SETTLE DOWN IN WASHINGTON AND MAKE A HOME THERE FOR POOR MEDORA
THEY LUNCHED SLOWLY AND MEDITATIVELY WITH MUTE INTERVALS BETWEEN RUSHES OF TALK FOR THE SPELL ONCE BROKEN THEY HAD MUCH TO SAY AND YET MOMENTS WHEN SAYING BECAME THE MERE ACCOMPANIMENT
TO MAKE THIS MEETING THEIR LAST HE MUST LEAVE THEIR FUTURE IN HER CARE ASKING ONLY THAT SHE SHOULD KEEP FAST HOLD OF IT DON'T DON'T BE UNHAPPY
BY REACHING HER LONG HAND TOWARD THE BELL ROPE I THINK SHE SAID I SHOULD LIKE HENRY TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME A FOOTMAN APPEARED TO WHOM SHE GRAVELY ADDED
TO CALL ON MISSUS WELLAND AFTER WHICH HE AND MISSUS WELLAND AND MAY DROVE OUT TO OLD MISSUS MANSON MINGOTT'S TO RECEIVE THAT VENERABLE ANCESTRESS'S BLESSING A VISIT TO MISSUS MANSON MINGOTT
HE TURNED AROUND WITHOUT MOVING FROM HIS PLACE AND IN THAT CASE THERE'S NO REASON ON EARTH WHY YOU SHOULDN'T GO BACK HE CONCLUDED FOR HER HER EYES WERE CLINGING TO HIM DESPERATELY
THAT HE SHOULD NEVER AGAIN FEEL QUITE ALONE BUT AFTER A MOMENT THE SENSE OF WASTE AND RUIN OVERCAME HIM THERE THEY WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND SAFE AND SHUT IN
THE TICK OF THE MONUMENTAL ORMOLU CLOCK ON THE WHITE MARBLE MANTELPIECE GREW AS LOUD AS THE BOOM OF A MINUTE GUN ARCHER CONTEMPLATED WITH AWE
FLUTTERED OVER MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S FACE SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GUESSED AND APPROVED MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN TURNED TO MISSUS ARCHER IF LOUISA'S HEALTH ALLOWED HER TO DINE OUT
IT'S BEYOND HUMAN ENDURING THAT'S ALL OH DON'T SAY THAT WHEN I'M ENDURING IT SHE BURST OUT HER EYES FILLING HER ARMS HAD DROPPED ALONG THE TABLE AND SHE SAT WITH HER FACE ABANDONED TO HIS GAZE
DON'T WAIT TILL THE BUBBLE'S OFF THE WINE MARRY THEM BEFORE LENT I MAY CATCH PNEUMONIA ANY WINTER NOW AND I WANT TO GIVE THE WEDDING BREAKFAST THESE SUCCESSIVE STATEMENTS WERE RECEIVED
THOUGH NON COMMITTAL BY NATURE AND TRAINING SHE WAS VERY KIND TO THE PEOPLE SHE REALLY LIKED EVEN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF THESE FACTS WAS NOT ALWAYS A PROTECTION FROM THE CHILL THAT DESCENDED ON ONE
WERE GATHERING UP THEIR POSSESSIONS PREPARATORY TO A STRAGGLING FLIGHT TO THE WHARF ACROSS THE BEACH LAY THE WHITE STEAM BOAT AT THE PIER AND OVER THE SUNLIT WATERS BOSTON LOOMED
AT THAT HE SPRANG UP FORGETTING EVERYTHING BUT THE SWEETNESS OF HER FACE SHE ROSE TOO NOT AS IF TO MEET HIM OR TO FLEE FROM HIM BUT QUIETLY
TO LONG DUOLOGUES OF SILENCE ARCHER KEPT THE TALK FROM HIS OWN AFFAIRS NOT WITH CONSCIOUS INTENTION BUT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO MISS A WORD OF HER HISTORY AND LEANING ON THE TABLE
YOU SHOULD HAVE MAY'S DONE NO DOUBT HE'LL HAVE IT DONE MY CHILD HER HAND IS LARGE IT'S THESE MODERN SPORTS THAT SPREAD THE JOINTS BUT THE SKIN IS WHITE AND WHEN'S THE WEDDING TO BE SHE BROKE OFF FIXING HER EYES ON ARCHER'S FACE
BEING LONG FORESEEN BY WATCHFUL RELATIVES HAD BEEN CAREFULLY PASSED UPON IN FAMILY COUNCIL AND THE ENGAGEMENT RING A LARGE THICK SAPPHIRE SET IN INVISIBLE CLAWS MET WITH HER UNQUALIFIED ADMIRATION
PRESENTLY THE HOARDINGS THE QUARRIES THE ONE STORY SALOONS THE WOODEN GREEN HOUSES IN RAGGED GARDENS AND THE ROCKS FROM WHICH GOATS SURVEYED THE SCENE
SHE DREW TOGETHER HER TROUBLED BROWS BUT IT SEEMS AS IF I'D NEVER BEFORE UNDERSTOOD WITH HOW MUCH THAT IS HARD AND SHABBY AND BASE
WE'LL HOPE IT HAS NOT QUITE COME TO THAT SAID MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN FIRMLY AH IF ONLY YOU AND LOUISA WENT OUT MORE SIGHED MISSUS ARCHER
FOR A LONG TIME I'VE HOPED THIS CHANCE WOULD COME THAT I MIGHT TELL YOU HOW YOU'VE HELPED ME WHAT YOU'VE MADE OF ME ARCHER SAT STARING BENEATH FROWNING BROWS HE INTERRUPTED HER WITH A LAUGH
AND MINE A PART OF YOURS SHE NODDED AND THAT'S TO BE ALL FOR EITHER OF US WELL IT IS ALL ISN'T IT
OF COURSE I KNOW YES AND I'M SO GLAD BUT ONE DOESN'T TELL SUCH THINGS FIRST IN A CROWD THE LADIES WERE ON THE THRESHOLD AND SHE HELD OUT HER HAND GOOD BYE COME AND SEE ME SOME DAY SHE SAID STILL LOOKING AT ARCHER
WITH THE PROPER EXPRESSIONS OF AMUSEMENT INCREDULITY AND GRATITUDE AND THE VISIT WAS BREAKING UP IN A VEIN OF MILD PLEASANTRY WHEN THE DOOR OPENED TO ADMIT THE COUNTESS OLENSKA WHO ENTERED IN BONNET AND MANTLE
HE TURNED TOWARD THE YOUNG MAN HAVE YOU READ THIS MORNING'S TIMES NEWLAND WHY YES SIR SAID ARCHER WHO USUALLY TOSSED OFF HALF A DOZEN PAPERS WITH HIS MORNING COFFEE
BUT I USED TO AND HE UNDERSTANDS AH IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS TOLD YOU YOU DON'T LIKE US AND YOU LIKE BEAUFORT BECAUSE HE'S SO UNLIKE US HE LOOKED ABOUT THE BARE ROOM
THE CARNIVOROUS OLD LADY DECLARED IN THE HALL WHILE MISSUS WELLAND AND MAY DREW ON THEIR FURS ARCHER SAW THAT THE COUNTESS OLENSKA WAS LOOKING AT HIM WITH A FAINTLY QUESTIONING SMILE
SOME TIME THEN SOME TIME THAT YOU ALREADY FORESEE
IT SEEMS SO TO ME SAID HIS WIFE AS IF SHE WERE PRODUCING A NEW THOUGHT I HAD NO IDEA MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN CONTINUED THAT THINGS HAD COME TO SUCH A PASS
OF COURSE YOU KNOW ALREADY ABOUT MAY AND ME HE SAID
WAS ALWAYS AN AMUSING EPISODE TO THE YOUNG MAN THE HOUSE IN ITSELF WAS ALREADY AN HISTORIC DOCUMENT THOUGH NOT OF COURSE AS VENERABLE AS CERTAIN OTHER OLD FAMILY HOUSES IN UNIVERSITY PLACE AND LOWER FIFTH AVENUE
TO LAY SIEGE TO THE TIGHT LITTLE CITADEL OF NEW YORK OF COURSE IF YOU AND REGINA INVITE HER THE THING IS SETTLED WELL WE NEED NEW BLOOD AND NEW MONEY AND I HEAR SHE'S STILL VERY GOOD LOOKING
UPHOLSTERED LIKE A SOFA AND A TOILET TABLE WITH FRIVOLOUS LACE FLOUNCES AND A GILT FRAMED MIRROR HER VISITORS WERE STARTLED AND FASCINATED BY THE FOREIGNNESS OF THIS ARRANGEMENT
OLD FASHIONED EYES I HOPE YOU DON'T MEAN MINE MY DEAR I LIKE ALL THE NOVELTIES SAID THE ANCESTRESS LIFTING THE STONE TO HER SMALL BRIGHT ORBS WHICH NO GLASSES HAD EVER DISFIGURED
PRESIDING AT A CABINET MEETING NOT FROM ANY ARROGANCE OF MIND BUT BECAUSE THE HABIT OF A LIFE TIME AND THE ATTITUDE OF HER FRIENDS AND RELATIONS HAD LED HER TO CONSIDER MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN'S LEAST GESTURE
THAN THE GRIMNESS OF SOME OF HIS MOTHER'S OLD AUNTS FIERCE SPINSTERS WHO SAID NO ON PRINCIPLE BEFORE THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE ASKED MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S ATTITUDE SAID NEITHER YES NOR NO
BUT ARCHER KNEW THAT MISSUS WELLAND WAS THINKING IT'S A MISTAKE FOR ELLEN TO BE SEEN THE VERY DAY AFTER HER ARRIVAL
I MET THE COUNTESS ELLEN IN MADISON SQUARE AND SHE WAS GOOD ENOUGH TO LET ME WALK HOME WITH HER AH I HOPE THE HOUSE WILL BE GAYER NOW THAT ELLEN'S HERE CRIED MISSUS MINGOTT WITH A GLORIOUS EFFRONTERY SIT DOWN SIT DOWN BEAUFORT PUSH UP THE YELLOW ARMCHAIR
THEN THE WOLF STRETCHED OUT HIS LARGE HAIRY PAWS AND BEGAN TO UNFASTEN THE BASKET OH SAID RED RIDING HOOD WHAT GREAT ARMS YOU HAVE GRANNIE
AND SEE THE MYRIADS WHO ARE NOT SO FORTUNATE TO WEAR HONEST LINEN WHILE MAGNIFICOS OF THE WORLD ARE ADORNED WITH CAMBRIC AND POINT LACE SURELY WE OUGHT TO HOLD AS MISERABLE ENVIOUS FOOLS
AS IF IT WERE ONE OF THE AMUSEMENTS OF LIFE BUT A DAY COMES WHEN LOVE PROVES ITSELF THE MOST SENSUOUS THING ON EARTH AND A GIRL IS QUICK TO DISCOVER THE KIND OF LOVE THAT IS REQUIRED OF HER AS A RULE MANY A GIRL WHO HAS BEEN SORE PUT TO IT
WHO REFLECTS THAT SHE HAS NEVER BEEN THERE THE WIDOW IS VEXED OUT OF PATIENCE BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER MARIA HAS GOT A PLACE BESIDE YOUNG CAMBRIC THE PENNILESS CURATE AND NOT BY COLONEL GOLDMORE THE RICH WIDOWER FROM INDIA
WHICH MAKES THEM MORE SOMETHING OR OTHERISH STILL THERE IS NO OTHER WORD FOR IT A GIRL IS A COMPLICATED THING IT IS MADE UP OF CLOTHES SMILES A POMPADOUR THINGS OF WHICH SPACE AND PRUDENCE FORBID THE ENUMERATION HERE
WHY THEN I DO BELIEVE SHE IS A VERY DEAR OLD FRIEND OF MINE WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN FOR YEARS AND YEARS NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO YOU AND I I WILL GO BY THIS WAY AND YOU SHALL TAKE THAT AND WHOEVER GETS THERE FIRST
IF ANY OF THE WISE PRO FESS ORS COULD HELP HIM BUT THEY SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ABOUT KING JOHN IN ANY OF THEIR BOOKS THEN THE ABBOT RODE DOWN TO CAM BRIDGE
THE MASCULINE MIND IS THE SLAVE OF LAW AND JUSTICE APHRODITE NEVER HEARD OF LAW OR JUSTICE SHE WAS BORN AT SEA THAT IS TO SAY FEW ARE THE MEN WHO AT SOME TIME IN THEIR LIVES HAVE NOT WONDERED AT THE VAGARIES
SILENCE FAW THE CHAIR NOW IF THIS BE THE CASE IF THE BRUMMAGEM PLATE POMP AND THE PROCESSIONS OF DISGUISED FOOTMEN ARE ODIOUS AND FOOLISH IN EVERYDAY LIFE
THAN THE HIGH SPIRITED HIGH BRED GIRL OF THIS SHE IS QUITE AWARE TO OUR COST I SPEAK AS A MAN THE CONSEQUENCE IS HER PRICE HAS GONE UP AND MAN HAS TO PAY HIGH AND PAY ALL SORTS OF THINGS
ARE THEY GIVEN THE REIN FOR A SINGLE PASSING MOMENT INSTEAD OF BEING ACCOUNTED UNTO HER FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY WORK HER RUIN SHE MUST WIN HER ONE MAN AND SHE MUST WIN HIM FOR LIFE BUT SHE CANNOT PICK OR CHOOSE FOR SHE MUST WAIT TO BE ASKED
NOT THAT THIS IS IN ANY WAY DISPARAGING TO THE GIRLS THE FACT IS A GIRL IS AN INFINITE PUZZLE AND IT IS THIS PUZZLE THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS
AND TO FLAUNT HIS MAGNIFICENT FAN TAIL IN THE SUNSHINE THE JAYS WITH PEACOCKS FEATHERS ARE THE SNOBS OF THIS WORLD AND NEVER SINCE THE DAYS OF AESOP WERE THEY MORE NUMEROUS IN ANY LAND
SAD NEWS SAD NEWS SAID THE ABBOT AND THEN HE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED CHEER UP CHEER UP GOOD MASTER SAID THE SHEPHERD HAVE YOU NEVER YET HEARD
OF SUSTAINING TONE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME BUT WITH THE ADVENT OF THE MODERN PIANO WITH ITS COMPARATIVELY GREAT SUSTAINING POWER AND ALSO WITH THE ADVENT IN VOCAL MUSIC OF A NEW STYLE OF SINGING GERMAN LIEDER SINGING AS CONTRASTED
BUT THIS IS A THORNY SUBJECT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT ALL MEN LOVE ALL GIRLS THE MAID OF SWEET SIXTEEN EQUALLY WITH THE MAID OF UNTOLD AGE THERE IS SOMETHING EXASPERATINGLY SOMETHING OR OTHERISH ABOUT GIRLS AND THEY KNOW IT
YOU ARE VERY VERY KIND AND I HAVE A MIND TO LET YOU TRY YOUR PLAN BUT IF THE WORST COMES TO THE WORST YOU SHALL NOT DIE FOR ME I WILL DIE FOR MYSELF SO THE SHEPHERD GOT READY TO GO AT ONCE HE DRESSED HIMSELF WITH GREAT CARE
THAN A GIRL WITH NONE SHE KNOWS MORE OF MEN ESPECIALLY OF THEIR WEAKNESSES AND IDIOSYNCRASIES AND TO KNOW THE WEAKNESSES AND IDIOSYNCRASIES OF MEN IS PERHAPS A WIFE'S CHIEF TASK UNLESS IT BE TO PUT UP WITH THEM
WHITE FRILLED NIGHTCAP NEARLY HIDING HER FACE NOW YOU AND I HAVE GUESSED BY THIS TIME ALTHOUGH POOR RED RIDING HOOD NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING THAT IT WAS NOT HER GRANNIE AT ALL BUT THE WICKED WOLF WHO HAD HURRIED TO THE COTTAGE
IN THE CASE OF BOTH MORDENT AND DOUBLE MORDENT
WAS AT THE TIME WHEN ALL THE BIRDS AND BEASTS OR VERY NEARLY ALL COULD SPEAK JUST AS WELL AS YOU OR I AND NOBODY WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THEM TALK AS I SUPPOSE ONE WOULD BE NOWADAYS WELL
OFTEN ENOUGH THE FRECKLED AND FRINGRANT GIRL WINS OVER THE PROFESSIONAL BEAUTY SOMETIMES GROWN UP GIRLS ARE JUST AS SHY AS LITTLE ONES AND FOR THE SAME REASONS BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY WITH THEM GIRLS OFTEN PLAY WITH LOVE
IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND BUT BUT FEW THINGS MYSTIFY POOR LAW ABIDING MAN THAN THIS THAT THE CENTRAL THE PROFOUNDEST THE MOST PORTENTOUS PUZZLE OF THE UNIVERSE THE WEAL OF WOE OF TWO HIGH ASPIRING
IN THAT GREAT SCHOOL COULD HELP HIM AT LAST
WHAT A MAN DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT A GIRL WOULD FILL A SARATOGA TRUNK
HAVE SOUGHT FOR AND ASSERTED THE EXISTENCE OF THE IDEAL GIRL THIS IS SHEER NONSENSE THERE IS NO SUCH THING AND IF THERE WERE SHE COULD NOT COMPARE WITH THE REAL GIRL
AN IMPERFECT TRILL IS ONE CLOSING WITHOUT A TURN SIXTY SIX
THESE THINGS BY THEMSELVES DO NOT CONSTITUTE A GIRL WHICH IS OBVIOUS NOR IS ANY ONE GIRL WITHOUT THESE THINGS WHICH IS NOT TOO OBVIOUS WHERE THE THINGS END AND THE GIRL BEGINS MANY MEN HAVE TRIED TO FIND OUT
TO WITHIN A DAY JUST HOW LONG I SHALL LIVE SEC OND LY YOU MUST TELL ME HOW SOON I SHALL RIDE ROUND THE WHOLE WORLD AND LASTLY YOU SHALL TELL ME WHAT I THINK
FLIRTATIONS LIKE CLANDESTINE ENGAGEMENTS ARE AN AFFRONT TO LOVE
YOUNG WOMEN THEMSELVES BUT RARELY UNSOPHISTICATED VIEW WITH A CERTAIN PITYING SORT OF CURIOSITY UNSOPHISTICATEDNESS IN MEN AND A YOUNG MAN'S UNSOPHISTICATEDENESS IT IS A GREAT DELIGHT TO A WOMAN TO ERADICATE YET
GROWLED THE WOLF SPRINGING UP SUDDENLY AT RED RIDING HOOD BUT JUST AT THAT VERY MOMENT THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND TWO TALL WOOD CUTTERS
SECRETLY IT MAY BE FOR OFTEN THE GIRL NEVERTHELESS DEVOTEDLY AND ONLY UNDER COMPULSION WILL HE LISTEN TO THE DETRACTOR HE MAY DESERT HER OR IF HE STICKS TO HER HE MAY BEAT HER NO MATTER HE HOLDS HER HEART
THAN HER SIX BROTHERS THREE OR FOUR OF WHOM WE ARE PRETTY SURE WILL FAVOUR US WITH THEIR COMPANY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK OR HER ANGELIC MOTHER
HERE'S A TO DO SHE SAID FARMER HODGE HAS THIS VERY MINUTE TOLD ME THAT HE HEARS YOUR GRANNIE ISN'T QUITE WELL AND I CAN'T LEAVE THE CHEESE MAKING THIS MORNING FOR LOVE OR MONEY DO YOU GO MY DEAR
THROUGH THE COPSE AND DOWN THE HOLLOW AND OVER THE BRIDGE AND THREE MEADOWS AFTER THE MILL
LITTLE INSCRIPTION TO MY WIFE MISSUS SNOB AND A HALF SCORE OF SILVER TANKARDS FOR THE LITTLE SNOBLINGS TO GLITTER ON THE HOMELY TABLE WHERE THEY PARTAKE OF THEIR QUOTIDIAN MUTTON IF I HAD MY WAY
A RICH OLD ABBOT WHO LIVED IN GRAND STYLE IN A GREAT HOUSE CALLED THE ABBEY EVERY DAY A HUNDRED NOBLE MEN SAT DOWN WITH HIM TO DINE AND FIFTY BRAVE KNIGHTS IN FINE VELVET COATS AND GOLD CHAINS
AND YOUR EYES GRANNIE WHAT GREAT YELLOW EYES YOU HAVE
A WOMAN THINKS SHE DETECTS SERIOUSNESS IN FLIPPANCY WHAT WOULD BE CONDUCT DECIDEDLY RISQUE IN A CITY MISS IS OFTEN INNOCENT PLAYFULNESS IN A COUNTRY MAID
INTRODUCED TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE NEAT PARLOUR MAID THE MISERABLE ENTREES FROM THE PASTRYCOOK'S ORDERED IN AND THE CHILDREN PACKED OFF AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO THE NURSERY BUT REALLY ONLY TO THE STAIRCASE
OFTEN WORKS MORE HAVOC THAN HAPPINESS FOR EITHER ONE OF THE PARTIES TO THE CONCEALED COMPACT RECEIVES OR PAYS ATTENTION WHICH PERTURB THE OTHER OR A SUBSEQUENT AND ACKNOWLEDGED LOVER LOOKS ASKANCE AT THE PREVIOUS ENTANGLEMENT
WITH BITTERNESS IN HIS HEART HAVING JUST QUITTED HIS LAUNDRESS WHO IS DUNNING HIM FOR HER BILL IS FIRING OFF GOOD STORIES AND THE OPPOSITION WAG IS FURIOUS THAT HE CANNOT GET AN INNINGS JAWKINS THE GREAT CONVERSATIONALIST
IS ALWAYS ACCENTED BUT THE ACCIACCATURA NEVER IS THE STRESS ALWAYS FALLING ON THE MELODY TONE SEE GROVE
SHE IS A THIRD SORT OF THING WHEN SHE IS WITH A MAN BUT THIS BAFFLED EVEN AGUR THE SON OF JAKEH AS A RULE A MAN PREFERS A GIRL BY HERSELF THIS IS NATURAL
ANSWER MY FIRST QUESTION HOW LONG SHALL I LIVE COME YOU MUST TELL ME TO THE VERY DAY YOU SHALL LIVE SAID THE SHEPHERD UNTIL THE DAY THAT YOU DIE AND NOT ONE DAY LONGER AND YOU SHALL DIE WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR LAST BREATH
SO LEND ME YOUR SERVANTS AND YOUR HORSE AND YOUR GOWN AND I WILL GO UP TO LONDON AND SEE THE KING IF NOTHING ELSE CAN BE DONE I CAN AT LEAST DIE IN YOUR PLACE
AS THE ABBOT WAS RIDING UP THE LANE WHICH LED TO HIS GRAND HOUSE HE MET HIS SHEP HERD GOING TO THE FIELDS WELCOME HOME GOOD MASTER CRIED THE SHEPHERD WHAT NEWS DO YOU BRING US FROM GREAT KING JOHN
IT WAS NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE GRACES OF ALL SORTS
WHO HAD ONLY ONE CHILD A LITTLE GIRL SHE WAS SO PRETTY AND SO GOOD THAT THE SUN SEEMED TO SHINE MORE BRIGHTLY WHEN ITS LIGHT FELL UPON HER ROSY LITTLE FACE
BUT INTERFERE THWART AND SUPPLANT ONE ANOTHER ISSAC BARROW THE VERY ESSENCE OF AN APHORISM IS THAT SLIGHT EXAGGERATION WHICH MAKES IT MORE BITING WHILST LESS RIGIDLY ACCURATE LESLIE STEPHEN
ALL WHITE WITH BLOSSOM AND THE CHILD BEGAN SINGING AS SHE WENT SHE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHY BUT I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE THE BEAUTIFUL WORLD MADE HER FEEL GLAD THE PATH WOUND ALONG THROUGH THE TREES AND AS IT GREW WIDER AFTER TURNING A CORNER
ONE WHEN IT IS POSSIBLE TO DIVIDE THE PRINCIPAL TONE INTO HALVES THEN THE APPOGGIATURA RECEIVES ONE HALF THE VALUE OF THE PRINTED NOTE
O KING THAT CANNOT BE SAID THE SHEPHERD
WHEN SHE CROSSED THE LAST MEADOW FROM THE MILL
WOULD GO INTO HER WORK BOX THE LITTLEST GIRL IS A LITTLE WOMEN NO BOY KNOWS THIS AND PRECIOUS FEW GROWN UP MEN THUS MANY A GROWN UP MAN PLAYS WITH A GIRL THEN FINDS HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER AS TO THE GIRL
OVER HIS SHEPHERD'S COAT HE THREW THE ABBOT'S LONG GOWN AND HE BOR ROWED THE ABBOT'S CAP AND GOLDEN STAFF WHEN ALL WAS READY NO ONE IN THE WORLD WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS NOT THE GREAT MAN HIMSELF THEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE
IS TAKEN FROM THAT OF THE MELODY TONE THE APPOGGIATURA WAS FORMERLY CLASSIFIED INTO LONG APPOGGIATURA
AND I AM TO SEE HOW SHE IS AND TELL MOTHER WHEN I GET BACK SAID THE CHILD WITH A SMILE AND SAID THE WOLF
AND SET OFF DOWN THE SUNNY GREEN SLOPE WITH HER BASKET IN HER HAND AT A BRISK PACE BUT AS SHE GOT DEEPER INTO THE FOREST SHE WALKED MORE SLOWLY EVERYTHING WAS SO BEAUTIFUL THE GREAT TREES WAVED THEIR HUGE ARMS OVER HER
TO PROVE HERSELF WHOLE HEARTED FOR OF COURSE ALWAYS EVERY SUITOR EXPECTS WHOLE HEARTEDNESS AND THIS EVERY GIRL INSTINCTIVELY KNOWS INDEED IS NOT A HALF HEARTED LOVE OR A HALF HEARTED ACCEPTRESS OF LOVE A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS
THE TURN COMES AT THE VERY END BUT IN BOTH CASES THE TIME TAKEN BY THE EMBELLISHMENT IS TAKEN FROM THE TIME VALUE OF THE PRINCIPAL NOTE FOR FURTHER DETAILS
HERE'S YOUR BASKET AND DON'T BE TOO LONG AWAY HONEY SO LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
LEST THERE BE ANY DISASTER THERE IF THE SOUFFLE SHOULD COLLAPSE OR IF WIGGINS DOES NOT SEND THE ICES IN TIME SHE FEELS AS IF SHE WOULD COMMIT SUICIDE THAT SMILING JOLLY WOMAN THE CHILDREN UPSTAIRS ARE YELLING
REPRESENTING THESE EMBELLISHMENTS AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE EXAMPLES OF ALL THE DIFFERENT FORMS THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS REPRESENT THEREFORE ONLY THE MOST COMMONLY FOUND EXAMPLES AND THE MOST GENERALLY ACCEPTED INTERPRETATIONS
THAT A FOOL MAY TEACH A WISE MAN WIT I THINK I CAN HELP YOU OUT OF YOUR TROUBLE YOU HELP ME CRIED THE ABBOT HOW HOW WELL ANSWERED THE SHEPHERD YOU KNOW THAT EVERYBODY SAYS
AND THE BIRDS WOULD SEEM TO SING MORE SWEETLY WHEN SHE WAS PASSING BY HER REAL NAME WAS MAISIE BUT THE NEIGHBORS ROUND ABOUT ALL CALLED HER LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
AND WITH A GREAT TRAIN OF SERVANTS SET OUT FOR LONDON OF COURSE THE KING DID NOT KNOW HIM WELCOME SIR ABBOT HE SAID IT IS A GOOD THING THAT YOU HAVE COME BACK BUT PROMPT AS YOU ARE
SINCE EVEN IF A CLANDESTINE ENGAGEMENT AS IS USUALLY THE CASE IS MERELY A FLIRTATION WITH THE EMOLUMENTS
AND YET IS SAID THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING IF THIS WERE TRUE A BEVY OF GIRLS WOULD BE THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS YET SOME MEN WOULD SOONER FACE THE BULLS OF BASHAN SOME FOOLISH MEN PROBABLY POETS
TO A HANDSOME COMFORTABLE DINNER SERVICE OF PLATE NOT INCLUDING PLATES FOR I HOLD SILVER PLATES TO BE SHEER WANTONNESS AND WOULD ALMOST AS SOON THINK OF SILVER TEACUPS A COUPLE OF NEAT TEAPOTS A COFFEEPOT
AGREMENTS ARE ORNAMENTAL TONES EITHER REPRESENTED IN FULL IN THE SCORE OR INDICATED BY CERTAIN SIGNS THE FOLLOWING ARE THE EMBELLISHMENTS MOST COMMONLY FOUND TRILL OR SHAKE MORDENT
SHOULD THE FAVORED ONE BE OPENLY CONVICTED THAT ALTERS NOT ONE WHIT HIS STATUE WITH THE GIRL FOR A GIRL HAVING GIVEN HER HEART NEVER RECALLS IT NOT WHOLLY SHE MAY REGRET SHE NEVER RECOILS IN OTHER WORDS
HATEFUL AS DISSEMBLANCE IN MEN T'IS A HARD ROAD INDEED THAT A GIRL HAS TO TRAVEL TO WIN HER A FELLOW FARER FOR LIFE SHE MUST GO OUT OF HER WAY TO ACCOMMODATE SO MANY TRAVELERS AND THIS ONE IS LURED BY THIS AND THAT ONE BY THAT
AND OH OH GRANNIE CRIED THE CHILD IN A SAD FRIGHT
MANY GIRLS WOULD LIKE TO BE MEN EXCEPT ON OCCASIONS AT LEAST SO THEY SAY BUT PERHAPS THIS IS JUST A PART OF THEIR SOMETHING OR OTHERISHNESS WHY THEY SHOULD WANT TO BE MEN MEN CANNOT CONCEIVE MEN PALE BEFORE THEM
IF SHE MAKE TEST OF MANY ADMIRERS SHE IS DESCRIBED AS A FLIRT IF CONSCIENTIOUS AND DEMURE SHE AWAIT HER FATE A DESIRABLE FATE IS BY NO MEANS ASSURED IN TRUTH IT SEEMS THAT TOO OFTEN A GIRL MUST DISSEMBLE
IS SOMETIMES CALLED A TRANSIENT SHAKE BECAUSE IT IS REALLY ONLY A PART OF THE MORE ELABORATE GRACE CALLED TRILL
AND BELGRAVIA EVEN TO THE REMOTEST CORNER OF BRUNSWICK SQUARE PEACOCKS FEATHERS ARE STUCK IN THE TAILS OF MOST FAMILIES SCARCE ONE OF US DOMESTIC BIRDS BUT IMITATES THE LANKY
LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD IN A GREAT WIDE FOREST FULL OF BEAUTIFUL TREES AND GREEN GLADES AND THORNY THICKETS THERE LIVED A LONG TIME AGO A WOOD CUTTER AND HIS WIFE
BUT WHERE IS GRANNIE ASKED LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD WHEN SHE HAD THANKED THE BRAVE WOOD CUTTERS OH
FATE HAS COMFORTABLY APPOINTED GOLD PLATE FOR SOME AND HAS BIDDEN OTHERS CONTENTEDLY TO WEAR THE WILLOW PATTERN AND BEING PERFECTLY CONTENTED INDEED HUMBLY THANKFUL FOR LOOK AROUND O JONES
FOR WHOM FINALLY WOULD I WISH TO CATER MORE GENEROUSLY THAN FOR YOUR VERY HUMBLE SERVANT THE PRESENT WRITER NOW NOBODY SUPPOSES THAT THE BIRMINGHAM PLATE IS HAD OUT THE DISGUISED CARPET BEATERS
THE SENIOR UNITED SERVICE HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE JOINT ONE AND THREE AND HALF PINT OF SHERRY NINE AND IF HIS GRACE WHY NOT YOU AND I THIS RULE I HAVE MADE AND FOUND THE BENEFIT OF
THE DISHES AND THE DRINK AND THE SERVANTS AND THE PLATE AND THE HOST AND HOSTESS AND THE CONVERSATION AND THE COMPANY THE PHILOSOPHER INCLUDED THE HOST IS SMILING AND HOB NOBBING AND TALKING UP AND DOWN THE TABLE
YOU ARE NOT ONLY WITTY BUT YOU ARE WISE AND WE WILL LET THIS ANSWER PASS AND NOW COMES MY THIRD AND LAST QUESTION WHAT DO I THINK
IS SCORNFUL AND INDIGNANT WITH THE PAIR OF THEM BECAUSE HE IS KEPT OUT OF COURT YOUNG MUSCADEL THAT CHEAP DANDY IS TALKING FASHION AND ALMACK'S OUT OF THE MORNING POST AND DISGUSTING HIS NEIGHBOUR MISSUS FOX
ON GIRLS A PEARL A GIRL BROWNING THERE ARE OF COURSE GIRLS AND GIRLS YET AT HEART THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH ALIKE IN AGE NATURALLY THEY DIFFER WILDLY
AS I WAS SAYING LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD LIVED WITH HER PARENTS IN A LITTLE WHITE COTTAGE WITH A GREEN DOOR AND A THATCHED ROOF AND RED AND WHITE ROSES CLIMBING ALL OVER THE WALLS
TO THE MAN OF HER OWN FREE LAWLESS CHOICE A GIRL IS ALWAYS LOYAL TO SUBSEQUENT AND SUBORDINATE ATTACHMENTS SHE IS DUTIFUL SO EVEN THE RENEGADE IF LOVED BY A GIRL WILL BE UPHELD BY THAT GIRL THROUGH THICK AND THIN
TO PEEP AT THE CHILD WHO WAS SO LIKE THEM IT WAS ON A BRIGHT SPRING MORNING EARLY IN MAY WHEN LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD HAD JUST FINISHED PUTTING AWAY THE BREAKFAST CUPS THAT HER MOTHER CAME BUSTLING IN FROM THE DAIRY
THE PRINCIPAL TONE NEXT THE HIGHEST TONE THIRD
AS IT IS THAT OF WHICH YOU PARTAKE YOURSELF FOR TOWARDS WHAT WOMAN IN THE WORLD DO I ENTERTAIN A HIGHER REGARD THAN TOWARDS THE BELOVED PARTNER OF MY EXISTENCE MISSUS SNOB WHO SHOULD HAVE A GREATER PLACE IN MY AFFECTIONS
WHOM YOU HAVE THE HONOUR OF KNOWING IF SUCH BE NOT THE CASE I AM FAR FROM WISHING THAT THEIR GRACES SHOULD TREAT ME IN A SIMILAR FASHION SPLENDOUR IS A PART OF THEIR STATION AS DECENT COMFORT LET US TRUST OF YOURS AND MINE
DINNER GIVING SNOBS FURTHER CONSIDERED IF MY FRIENDS WOULD BUT FOLLOW THE PRESENT PREVAILING FASHION I THINK THEY OUGHT TO GIVE ME A TESTIMONIAL FOR THE PAPER ON DINNER GIVING SNOBS WHICH I AM NOW WRITING
THE DOCTOR'S WIFE IS SULKY BECAUSE SHE HAS NOT BEEN LED OUT BEFORE THE BARRISTER'S LADY OLD DOCTOR CORK IS GRUMBLING AT THE WINE AND GUTTLETON SNEERING AT THE COOKERY AND TO THINK THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE MIGHT BE SO HAPPY
CONFESSION AND AVOIDANCE APHORISM ARE SELDOM COUCHED IN SUCH TERMS THAT THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS THEY SOUND PRECISELY OR ACCORDING TO THE WIDEST EXTENT OF SIGNIFICATION BUT DO COMMONLY NEED EXPOSITION AND ADMIT EXCEPTION
FOR NOW HE HAD NOT A WEEK TO LIVE
RUN BEFORE THEM AND AFTER THEM SWEAR BY THEM AND AT THEM AND A BIT OF A CHIT OF A THING IN SHORT SKIRTS AND LISLE THREAD STOCKINGS WILL TWIST ABLE BODIED MALES ROUND HER LITTLE FINGER IT IS AN OPEN SECRET THAT GIRLS ARE FONDER OF MEN
HE SAID I HEAR THAT YOU KEEP A FAR BETTER HOUSE THAN I HOW DARE YOU DO SUCH A THING DON'T YOU KNOW THAT NO MAN IN THE LAND OUGHT TO LIVE BETTER THAN THE KING AND I TELL YOU THAT NO MAN SHALL O KING SAID THE ABBOT
A GIRL REGARDS WITH COMPLEX EMOTIONS THE MAN WHO HAS BLOSSOMED UNDER THE GENIAL WARMTH OF HER RAYS THE FLATTERY TO OWN POWERS IS COUNTERBALANCED BY THE EVIDENCE OF LACK OF POWER IN HIM A GIRL THINKS SHE DETECTS FLIPPANCY IN SERIOUSNESS
AND SHRILL GENTEEL SCREAM O YOU MISGUIDED DINNER GIVING SNOBS THINK HOW MUCH PLEASURE YOU LOSE AND HOW MUCH MISCHIEF YOU DO WITH YOUR ABSURD GRANDEURS AND HYPOCRISIES YOU STUFF EACH OTHER WITH UNNATURAL FORCED MEATS
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR MEN OF SMALL MEANS TO BE CONTINUALLY SPENDING FIVE AND TWENTY OR THIRTY SHILLINGS ON EACH FRIEND WHO SITS DOWN TO THEIR TABLE PEOPLE DINE FOR LESS I MYSELF HAVE SEEN AT MY FAVOURITE CLUB
SHOULD BE AS ATTACHED AS MUCH IMPORTANCE AS TO THE WEDDING RING INDEED
AS THEIR MAID IS CRIMPING THEIR MISERABLE RINGLETS WITH HOT TONGS TEARING MISS EMMY'S HAIR OUT BY THE ROOTS OR SCRUBBING MISS POLLY'S DUMPY NOSE
SHE MAKES BELIEVE TO BE CAPTURED
AS SOME ONE OUGHT TO HAVE SAID ARE EXCELLENT THINGS IN WOMAN OTHER MEN EQUALLY FOOLISH HAVE REGARDED GIRLS AS PLAYTHINGS I WISH THESE MEN HAD TRIED TO PLAY WITH THEM THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT THEY WERE PLAYING WITH FIRE AND BRIMSTONE
A CERTAIN MEASURE OF THE SOPHISTICATED OR UNSOPHISTICATION OF A YOUTHFUL DAMSEL MAY BE FOUND
BUT IF THEN YOU FAIL TO ANSWER ME YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR HEAD AND ALL YOUR LANDS SHALL BE MINE THE ABBOT WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND IN GREAT FEAR HE FIRST RODE TO OXFORD HERE WAS A GREAT SCHOOL
THE HORRIBLE CEREMONY THE FOOLISH MAKESHIFTS THE MEAN POMP AND OSTENTATION WHICH DISTINGUISH OUR BANQUETS ON GRAND FIELD DAYS SUCH A NOTION IS MONSTROUS I WOULD AS SOON THINK OF HAVING MY DEAREST BESSY
DOWN WHICH THEY SLIDE DURING THE DINNER TIME WAYLAYING THE DISHES AS THEY COME OUT AND FINGERING THE ROUND BUMPS ON THE JELLIES AND THE FORCED MEAT BALLS IN THE SOUP NOBODY I SAY SUPPOSES THAT A DINNER AT HOME IS CHARACTERIZED BY
ICES SWEETS CHAMPAGNE DRIVES CHURCH GOINGS AND SOMETIMES SPOT CASH MEN ARE ALWAYS WISHING THEY KNEW ALL ABOUT GIRLS IT IS A PRECIOUS GOOD THING THAT THEY DON'T
SHOULD DISCLOSE HIS REAL QUALITY OF GREENGROCER AND SHOW THAT HE IS NOT THE FAMILY BUTLER THE HOSTESS IS SMILING RESOLUTELY THROUGH ALL THE COURSES SMILING THROUGH HER AGONY THOUGH HER HEART IS IN THE KITCHEN AND SHE IS SPECULATING WITH TERROR
OFTEN ENOUGH A PREPOSTEROUS ASSUMPTION WITH IT SHE IS LOOKED UPON TOO MUCH AND ALWAYS ALWAYS A GIRL HAS TO PRETEND THAT NEVER DID SHE DESCEND TO DISSEMBLANCE
THE KING LAUGHED AGAIN INDEED HE SAID
YOUR HEAD SHALL BE CUT OFF AND ALL YOUR RICHES SHALL BE MINE I WILL TRY TO ANSWER THEM O KING SAID THE ABBOT WELL THEN SAID KING JOHN AS I SIT HERE WITH MY CROWN OF GOLD ON MY HEAD YOU MUST TELL ME
WITH ITALIAN COLORATURA SINGING
AND EASY AND FRIENDLY WERE THEY BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A NATURAL UNPRETENTIOUS WAY AND BUT FOR AN UNHAPPY PASSION FOR PEACOCKS FEATHERS IN ENGLAND GENTLE SHADES OF MARAT AND ROBESPIERRE
THAN THEY ARE AT PRESENT IN THIS FREE COUNTRY HOW DOES THIS MOST ANCIENT APOLOGUE APPLY TO THE SUBJECT IN HAND THE DINNER GIVING SNOB THE IMITATION OF THE GREAT IS UNIVERSAL IN THIS CITY FROM THE PALACES OF KENSINGTONIA
GIRLS PLAY WITH LOVE AS IF IT WERE A DOLL VERY SOON AFTER TWENTY THEY DISCOVER IT IS A DYNAMO
FOR WHERE TWO CROSS PATHS DIVIDED THERE SAT A BIG GRAY WOLF LICKING HIS LONG PAWS AND LOOKING SHARPLY ABOUT HIM AND GOOD MORNING RED RIDING HOOD SAID HE GOOD MORNING MISTER WOLF SHE ANSWERED
ALEXIS SOYER THE REGENERATOR WHAT HE IN HIS NOBLE STYLE WOULD CALL THE MOST SUCCULENT SAVOURY AND ELEGANT PASSAGES ARE THOSE WHICH RELATE NOT TO THE GRAND BANQUETS AND CEREMONIAL DINNERS BUT TO HIS DINNERS AT HOME
SHALL BE THE WINNER OF THE GAME SO THE WOLF TROTTED OFF ONE WAY AND RED RIDING HOOD WENT THE OTHER AND I AM SORRY TO SAY THAT SHE LINGERED AND LOITERED MORE THAN SHE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE ON THE ROAD WELL WHAT WITH ONE THING AND ANOTHER
WAITED UPON HIM AT HIS TABLE WHEN KING JOHN HEARD OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE ABBOT LIVED HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO PUT A STOP TO IT SO HE SENT FOR THE OLD MAN TO COME AND SEE HIM HOW NOW MY GOOD ABBOT
SILENCE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GRANDCOURT SAID WHAT MEN ARE INVITED HERE WITH THEIR WIVES
AND WHAT REMAINED OF ALL THINGS KNOWABLE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THROUGH NOVELS PLAYS AND POEMS ABOUT HER FRENCH AND MUSIC THE TWO JUSTIFYING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A YOUNG LADY SHE FELT NO GROUND FOR UNEASINESS
ALWAYS SHE WAS THE PRINCESS IN EXILE WHO IN TIME OF FAMINE WAS TO HAVE HER BREAKFAST ROLL MADE OF THE FINEST BOLTED FLOUR FROM THE SEVEN THIN EARS OF WHEAT AND IN A GENERAL DECAMPMENT WAS TO HAVE HER SILVER FORK KEPT OUT OF THE BAGGAGE
CHAPTER TWELVE O GENTLEMEN THE TIME OF LIFE IS SHORT TO SPEND THAT SHORTNESS BASELY WERE TOO LONG IF LIFE DID RIDE UPON A DIAL'S POINT STILL ENDING AT THE ARRIVAL OF AN HOUR SHAKESPEARE
TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID
SINCE IN HIS OWN OPINION HE HAD NEVER DONE A BAD ACTION IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHOULD BE LIKELY TO COMMIT ONE IF HIS LOVE OF EASE REQUIRED IT LUSH'S LOVE OF EASE WAS WELL SATISFIED AT PRESENT
I WILL LEAD ANY LIFE YOU TELL ME BUT YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME YOU MUST BE NEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN NEAR ME IF I COULD HAVE SAID EVERYTHING TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT FORSAKE ME
WHO CAN WONDER IF GWENDOLEN FELT READY TO MANAGE HER OWN DESTINY THERE WERE MANY SUBJECTS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS THE MAJORITY IN WHICH SHE FELT NO INTEREST BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID
HAVE YOU FALLEN IN LOVE THIS QUESTION CARRIED A STRONG SNEER I AM GOING TO MARRY HER YOU HAVE MADE HER AN OFFER ALREADY THEN NO SHE IS A YOUNG LADY WITH A WILL OF HER OWN I FANCY
MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
IT COULD NEVER BE MY IMPULSE TO FORSAKE YOU SAID DERONDA PROMPTLY WITH THAT VOICE WHICH LIKE HIS EYES HAD THE UNINTENTIONAL EFFECT OF MAKING HIS READY SYMPATHY SEEM MORE PERSONAL AND SPECIAL THAN IT REALLY WAS
LUSH SPOKE CARELESSLY BUT HE WAS REALLY SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY AND FIXING AN OBSERVANT LOOK ON GRANDCOURT WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD HIS COMPANION BUT SLOWLY AND WITHOUT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN TWO LONG LUXURIANT PUFFS
BUT HER THOUGHTS NEVER DWELT ON MARRIAGE AS THE FULFILLMENT OF HER AMBITION THE DRAMAS IN WHICH SHE IMAGINED HERSELF A HEROINE WERE NOT WROUGHT UP TO THAT CLOSE TO BE VERY MUCH SUED OR HOPELESSLY SIGHED FOR AS A BRIDE WAS INDEED
SHE SPOKE HESITATINGLY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THEM SAID DERONDA I WAS THINKING TOO MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL SAID GWENDOLEN SLOWLY AS IF SHE WERE OVERCOMING HER RELUCTANCE
AND WHEN TO ALL THESE QUALIFICATIONS NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE WE ADD THE SPONTANEOUS SENSE OF CAPABILITY SOME HAPPY PERSONS ARE BORN WITH SO THAT ANY SUBJECT THEY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO IMPRESSES THEM WITH THEIR OWN POWER OF FORMING A CORRECT JUDGMENT ON IT
LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW
WORTH ANYTHING WORTHY ENOUGH I SHALL ALWAYS BE TOO WICKED TO THE VOICE BROKE OFF HELPLESS DERONDA'S HEART WAS PIERCED HE TURNED HIS EYES ON HER POOR BESEECHING FACE AND SAID
AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE
SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD TO A SINGLE LIFE BUT PROMOTIONS HAVE SOMETIMES TO BE TAKEN WITH BITTER HERBS A PEERAGE WILL NOT QUITE DO INSTEAD OF LEADERSHIP TO THE MAN WHO MEANT TO LEAD AND THIS DELICATE LIMBED SYLPH OF TWENTY MEANT TO LEAD
HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT
I SUPPOSE YOU SENT MY CARD AND INQUIRIES I WENT MYSELF AT FOUR AND SAID YOU WERE SURE TO BE THERE SHORTLY THEY WOULD SUPPOSE SOME ACCIDENT PREVENTED YOU FROM FULFILLING THE INTENTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO TO DAY
WHOSE FIRMNESS SHOWED ITSELF IN NO VERY GRACEFUL OR EUPHONIOUS WAY AND WHO WERE NOT ELDEST DAUGHTERS WITH A TENDER TIMID MOTHER COMPUNCTIOUS AT HAVING SUBJECTED THEM TO INCONVENIENCES
FOR SUCH PASSIONS DWELL IN FEMININE BREASTS ALSO IN GWENDOLEN'S HOWEVER THEY DWELT AMONG STRICTLY FEMININE FURNITURE AND HAD NO DISTURBING REFERENCE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING OR THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS YOU WILL GO ON MAKING THEM BUT YOU WERE THE BEGINNING OF THEM YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME SAID GWENDOLEN LEANING WITH HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM
WHY SHOULD HE BE EXPECTED TO DIFFER FROM HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS MATTER AND WISH HIS NIECE A WORSE END OF HER CHARMING MAIDENHOOD THAN THEY WOULD APPROVE AS THE BEST POSSIBLE
AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE
WHILE HER FACE BORE PITEOUS TRACES OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT NEW TERRIBLE LIFE LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEED WHICH FULFILLS A CRIMINAL DESIRE I WILL BEAR ANY PENANCE
IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM
AND SOONER OR LATER IT WORKS ITS WAY OUTSIDE US IT MAY BE IN THE VITIATION THAT BREEDS EVIL ACTS BUT ALSO IT MAY BE IN THE SELF ABHORRENCE THAT STINGS US INTO BETTER STRIVING I AM SAVED FROM ROBBING OTHERS
HER UNCLE'S INTENTION FELL IN PERFECTLY WITH GWENDOLEN'S OWN WISHES BUT LET NO ONE SUPPOSE THAT SHE ALSO CONTEMPLATED A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE AS THE DIRECT END OF HER WITCHING THE WORLD WITH HER GRACE ON HORSEBACK OR WITH ANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT
AND HE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF GETTING A TOO FRISKY HORSE IN ORDER THAT GWENDOLEN MIGHT BE THREATENED WITH AN ACCIDENT AND BE RESCUED BY A MAN OF PROPERTY HE WISHED HIS NIECE WELL AND HE MEANT HER TO BE SEEN TO ADVANTAGE IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
IT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO BLAME THE RECTOR OF PENNICOTE THAT IN THE COURSE OF LOOKING AT THINGS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW HE LOOKED AT GWENDOLEN AS A GIRL LIKELY TO MAKE A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE
HOW WAS THIS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE ANSWER MAY SEEM TO LIE QUITE ON THE SURFACE IN HER BEAUTY A CERTAIN UNUSUALNESS ABOUT HER
THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
NOT TILL AFTER SIR HUGO HAS COME BUT WE SHALL ALL GO TO ENGLAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAID DERONDA NOT WISHING TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS
SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE
THERE SEEMED TO BE A SUDDEN SUFFICIENT REASON FOR KEEPING UP THE FORMS OF LIFE AND EVEN THE WAITERS AT HOTELS SHOWED THE MORE ALACRITY IN DOING AWAY WITH CRUMBS AND CREASES AND DREGS WITH STRUGGLING FLIES IN THEM
OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT
IT WAS ALWAYS SHE HERSELF WHO HAD TO BE TOLERANT TO BEG THAT ALICE WHO SAT WAITING ON HER WOULD NOT STICK UP HER SHOULDERS IN THAT FRIGHTFUL MANNER AND THAT ISABEL INSTEAD OF PUSHING UP TO HER AND ASKING QUESTIONS WOULD GO AWAY TO MISS MERRY
AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE
AND TO HAVE THEIR LIVES BLOWN HITHER AND THITHER LIKE EMPTY SHIPS IN WHICH NO WILL WAS PRESENT IT WAS NOT TO BE SO WITH HER SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE SACRIFICED TO CREATURES WORTH LESS THAN HERSELF
AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
DEEDS ARE THE PULSE OF TIME HIS BEATING LIFE AND RIGHTEOUS OR UNRIGHTEOUS BEING DONE MUST THROB IN AFTER THROBS TILL TIME ITSELF BE LAID IN DARKNESS
A DECISION OF WILL WHICH MADE ITSELF FELT IN HER GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS AND CLEAR UNHESITATING TONES SO THAT IF SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM ON A RAINY DAY WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS FLACCID AND THE USE OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS NOT APPARENT TO THEM
GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING
DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
AN INDISPENSABLE AND AGREEABLE GUARANTEE OF WOMANLY POWER BUT TO BECOME A WIFE AND WEAR ALL THE DOMESTIC FETTERS OF THAT CONDITION WAS ON THE WHOLE A VEXATIOUS NECESSITY HER OBSERVATION OF MATRIMONY HAD INCLINED HER TO THINK IT RATHER A DREARY STATE
AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
IT IS RATHER TO BE SET DOWN TO HIS CREDIT THAT HIS FEELINGS ON THE SUBJECT WERE ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED AND IN CONSIDERING THE RELATION OF MEANS TO ENDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERE FOLLY TO HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY THE EXCEPTIONAL AND IDYLLIC
WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH
SHE FELT WELL EQUIPPED FOR THE MASTERY OF LIFE WITH REGARD TO MUCH IN HER LOT HITHERTO SHE HELD HERSELF RATHER HARDLY DEALT WITH BUT AS TO HER EDUCATION SHE WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT IT HAD LEFT HER UNDER NO DISADVANTAGES
THE FEAR AND THE FONDNESS BEING PERHAPS BOTH HEIGHTENED BY WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE IRIDESCENCE OF HER CHARACTER THE PLAY OF VARIOUS NAY CONTRARY TENDENCIES
I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN
SHALL YOU RIDE OR DRIVE TO QUETCHAM TO DAY I AM NOT GOING TO QUETCHAM YOU DID NOT GO YESTERDAY GRANDCOURT SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN SAID
PERHAPS NOT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH THEM BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM HERE IT WAS LUSH WHO MADE A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN
BEHOLDING A POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD SINNED HERSELF AWAY FROM
HE HELD IN HIS LAP A TINY MALTESE DOG WITH A TINY SILVER COLLAR AND BELL AND WHEN HE HAD A HAND UNUSED BY CIGAR OR COFFEE CUP IT RESTED ON THIS SMALL PARCEL OF ANIMAL WARMTH
THEN THERE ARE MISTER HOLLIS AND LADY FLORA AND THE CUSHATS AND THE GOGOFFS RATHER A RAGGED LOT REMARKED GRANDCOURT AFTER A WHILE WHY DID YOU ASK THE GOGOFFS
CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS
BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES
THE STILL LIFE IN THE ROOM WHICH SEEMED THE STILLER FOR ITS SOBER ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE AS IF IT KEPT A CONSCIOUS WELL BRED SILENCE UNLIKE THE RESTLESSNESS OF VULGAR FURNITURE WHETHER THE GENTLEMEN WERE AGREEABLE TO EACH OTHER WAS LESS EVIDENT
WHAT LUSH PUT DOWN HIS CIGAR AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS SIDE POCKETS AS IF HE HAD TO FACE SOMETHING EXASPERATING BUT MEANT TO KEEP HIS TEMPER I AM GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GIRL
WHICH AS DERONDA APPROACHED HER PASSED INTO AN ANXIOUS TIMIDITY SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND BUT SAID HOW LONG AGO IT IS THEN WILL YOU SIT NEAR ME AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE
TURN OUT THAT BRUTE WILL YOU SAID GRANDCOURT TO LUSH WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE OR LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE COUNTED ON ATTENTION TO THE SMALLEST SIGN AND LUSH IMMEDIATELY ROSE LIFTED FETCH THOUGH SHE WAS RATHER HEAVY
BUT WOULD MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THE CHANCES THAT LIFE OFFERED HER AND CONQUER CIRCUMSTANCES BY HER EXCEPTIONAL CLEVERNESS
BEFORE MY MOTHER COMES SAID GWENDOLEN AH I MUST BE CHANGED I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT MYSELF SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SHE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HIM IF YOU HAD MET ME NOW
FOR SUBJECTS ARE APT TO APPEAR STUPID TO THE YOUNG AS LIGHT SEEMS DULL TO THE OLD BUT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FELT AT ALL HELPLESS IN RELATION TO THEM IF THEY HAD TURNED UP IN CONVERSATION IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD DISPUTED HER POWER OR HER GENERAL SUPERIORITY
IN ORDER THAT A MARQUIS MIGHT FALL IN LOVE WITH HER OR TO HAVE INSISTED THAT SINCE A FAIR MAIDEN WAS TO BE SOUGHT SHE SHOULD KEEP HERSELF OUT OF THE WAY MISTER GASCOIGNE'S CALCULATIONS WERE OF THE KIND CALLED RATIONAL
YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF MUCH TROUBLE PERHAPS BUT SOME FORMS MUST BE GONE THROUGH BEFORE A MAN CAN MARRY A MILLION VERY LIKELY BUT I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY A MILLION
IF WHEN THEY WERE UNDER THE STRESS OF TRAVELING SHE DID NOT APPEAR AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE TILL EVERY ONE ELSE HAD FINISHED THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HOW GWENDOLEN'S COFFEE AND TOAST SHOULD STILL BE OF THE HOTTEST AND CRISPEST
WE MUST FIND OUR DUTIES IN WHAT COMES TO US NOT IN WHAT WE IMAGINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF I TOOK TO FOOLISH WISHING OF THAT SORT I SHOULD WISH NOT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN YOU BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS
AND ONE OF YOUR DAMNED MUSICIANS BUT NOT A COMIC FELLOW I WONDER IF KLESMER WOULD CONSENT TO COME TO US WHEN HE LEAVES QUETCHAM NOTHING BUT FIRST CLASS MUSIC WILL GO DOWN WITH MISS ARROWPOINT
AND THEN HE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE GOOD GOD GRANDCOURT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL YOU LET A WHIM INTERFERE WITH YOUR COMFORTABLE SETTLEMENT IN LIFE SPARE YOUR ORATORY I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
THIS POTENT CHARM ADDED TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS THE ELDEST DAUGHTER TOWARD WHOM HER MAMMA HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN AN APOLOGETIC STATE OF MIND FOR THE EVILS BROUGHT ON HER BY A STEP FATHER MAY SEEM SO FULL A REASON FOR GWENDOLEN'S DOMESTIC EMPIRE
THEN CAME HATRED AND WICKED THOUGHTS THAT WAS HOW IT ALL CAME I TOLD YOU I WAS AFRAID OF MYSELF
IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
THE ARCHERY CLUB AND INVITATIONS TO DINE WITH THE ARROWPOINTS AS THE HIGHEST LIGHTS IN HER SCENERY WAS NOT A POSITION THAT SEEMED TO OFFER REMARKABLE CHANCES BUT GWENDOLEN'S CONFIDENCE LAY CHIEFLY IN HERSELF
BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY
WHAT WILL GWENDOLEN THINK IF THE FOOTMAN TROD HEAVILY IN CREAKING BOOTS OR IF THE LAUNDRESS'S WORK WAS UNSATISFACTORY THE MAID SAID THIS WILL NEVER DO FOR MISS HARLETH
THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT
THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME
AND GRANDCOURT KEPT SO MANY DOGS THAT HE WAS REPUTED TO LOVE THEM AT ANY RATE HIS IMPULSE TO ACT JUST IN THAT WAY STARTED FROM SUCH AN INTERPRETATION BUT WHEN THE AMUSING ANGUISH BURST FORTH IN A HOWLING BARK
IN THE SCHOOL ROOM HER QUICK MIND HAD TAKEN READILY THAT STRONG STARCH OF UNEXPLAINED RULES AND DISCONNECTED FACTS WHICH SAVES IGNORANCE FROM ANY PAINFUL SENSE OF LIMPNESS
THAT SHE WAS TO BE MARRIED SOME TIME OR OTHER SHE WOULD HAVE FELT OBLIGED TO ADMIT AND THAT HER MARRIAGE WOULD NOT BE OF A MIDDLING KIND SUCH AS MOST GIRLS WERE CONTENTED WITH SHE FELT QUIETLY UNARGUMENTATIVELY SURE
IF THE WOOD SMOKED IN THE BEDROOM FIREPLACE MISSUS DAVILOW WHOSE OWN WEAK EYES SUFFERED MUCH FROM THIS INCONVENIENCE SPOKE APOLOGETICALLY OF IT TO GWENDOLEN
THAT TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER WOULD BE TO ASK THE REASON OF DAYLIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BUT BEWARE OF ARRIVING AT CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT COMPARISON
WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS
EXTREMELY WELL FITTED TO MAKE A RUMPUS SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE LIKED SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU SAID GRANDCOURT WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE PERFECTLY TRUE SAID LUSH ADDING AGAIN IN A MARKEDLY SNEERING TONE
ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
FOR MACBETH'S RHETORIC ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING MANY OPPOSITE THINGS IN THE SAME MOMENT REFERRED TO THE CLUMSY NECESSITIES OF ACTION AND NOT TO THE SUBTLER POSSIBILITIES OF FEELING WE CANNOT SPEAK A LOYAL WORD AND BE MEANLY SILENT
IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO NOW SAID DERONDA WORN IN SPIRIT BY THE PERPETUAL STRAIN OF THIS SCENE REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID OF YOUR TASK TO GET WELL AND CALM BEFORE OTHER FRIENDS COME
WE CANNOT KILL AND NOT KILL IN THE SAME MOMENT
BUT THEN WE BECAME POOR ALL AT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND I WAS TEMPTED I THOUGHT I SHALL DO AS I LIKE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT I PERSUADED MYSELF AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL DREADFUL
AND AGAIN TURNED WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION WHICH YET DID NOT ISSUE IN SPEECH THERE WAS SOME FEAR HINDERING HER AND DERONDA WISHING TO RELIEVE HER TIMIDITY AVERTED HIS FACE
THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL
WHEN YOU ARE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN YOU WILL DISCERN NEW DUTIES SAID DERONDA MAKE IT A TASK NOW TO GET AS WELL AND CALM AS MUCH LIKE YOURSELF AS YOU CAN BEFORE HE HESITATED
GAVE A VACILLATING PREFERENCE FIRST TO ONE GENTLEMAN THEN TO THE OTHER BEING DOGS IN SUCH GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY COULD PLAY AT HUNGER AND LIKED TO BE SERVED WITH DELICACIES WHICH THEY DECLINED TO PUT IN THEIR MOUTHS ALL EXCEPT FETCH
GRANDCOURT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAD TWO REMARKABLY DIFFERENT VOICES HITHERTO WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAKING IN A SUPERFICIAL INTERRUPTED DRAWL SUGGESTIVE CHIEFLY OF LANGUOR
AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
AND A GENTLEMAN'S DOGS SHOULD BE KICKED FOR HIM HE ONLY SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO BE KICKED IF HIS CONFIDANT HAD BEEN A MAN OF INDEPENDENT SPIRIT
PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE ARCHERY MEETING MISTER HENLEIGH MALLINGER GRANDCOURT WAS AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE WITH MISTER LUSH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS AGREEABLE
HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM
HER KNOWLEDGE BEING SUCH AS WITH NO SORT OF STANDING ROOM OR LENGTH OF LEVER COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MOVE THE WORLD SHE MEANT TO DO WHAT WAS PLEASANT TO HERSELF IN A STRIKING MANNER
IN WHICH A WOMAN COULD NOT DO WHAT SHE LIKED HAD MORE CHILDREN THAN WERE DESIRABLE WAS CONSEQUENTLY DULL AND BECAME IRREVOCABLY IMMERSED IN HUMDRUM OF COURSE MARRIAGE WAS SOCIAL PROMOTION
GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH
AND OTHER FEMALE GIMCRACKS ARRANGED AND SHE SEATED IN SOME ARTLESS AND AGREEABLE POSTURE READY TO RECEIVE HIM WHENEVER SHE WAS SURPRISED OF COURSE
SAID THE PEER WITH AN OATH AND BECKY REFLECTING ON THE LARGENESS OF HIS MEANS MENTIONED NOT ONLY THE SUM WHICH SHE HAD BORROWED FROM MISS BRIGGS BUT ONE OF NEARLY DOUBLE THE AMOUNT THIS CAUSED THE LORD STEYNE TO BREAK OUT IN ANOTHER BRIEF AND ENERGETIC EXPRESSION OF ANGER
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO HOLD YOUR OWN THERE YOU SILLY LITTLE FOOL YOU'VE GOT NO MONEY YOU WILL GET US A PLACE INTERPOSED BECKY AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE YOU'VE GOT NO MONEY AND YOU WANT TO COMPETE WITH THOSE WHO HAVE
WERE DESTINED TO MEET WITH AN EXCEEDING GREAT REWARD A REWARD WHICH THOUGH CERTAINLY SOMEWHAT UNSUBSTANTIAL THE LITTLE WOMAN COVETED WITH GREATER EAGERNESS THAN MORE POSITIVE BENEFITS
SOME FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS SINCE AS THE MOST BRILLIANT COSTUME OF THE MOST FAMOUS BEAUTY OF THE PRESENT SEASON A SCORE OF YEARS HENCE THAT TOO THAT MILLINER'S WONDER WILL HAVE PASSED INTO THE DOMAIN OF THE ABSURD
IF GOOD QUEEN CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN ALIVE IN THIS WAY THE WORTHY RECTORESS CONSOLED HERSELF AND HER DAUGHTERS SIGHED AND SAT OVER THE PEERAGE ALL NIGHT A FEW DAYS AFTER THE FAMOUS PRESENTATION
AS SHE SAT AT WORK AND SITTING DOWN TO THE PIANO SHE RATTLED AWAY A TRIUMPHANT VOLUNTARY ON THE KEYS WHICH MADE THE PEOPLE PAUSE UNDER HER WINDOW TO LISTEN TO HER BRILLIANT MUSIC THAT NIGHT
WHICH HAD GROWN WOEFULLY SHABBY AND WAS MUCH TOO TIGHT HE WAS TO HAVE FOLLOWED THE PROCESSION AND WAITED UPON HIS SOVEREIGN IN A CAB BUT THAT HIS GOOD NATURED SISTER IN LAW INSISTED THAT THEY SHOULD BE A FAMILY PARTY THE COACH WAS LARGE
BUT I HOPE YOUR LORDSHIP IS ORTHODOX SAID THE LITTLE LADY WITH A TOSS OF HER HEAD AND MANY LADIES ROUND ABOUT WHISPERED AND TALKED AND MANY GENTLEMEN NODDED AND WHISPERED AS THEY SAW WHAT MARKED ATTENTION THE GREAT NOBLEMAN WAS PAYING TO THE LITTLE ADVENTURESS
AS SHE LOOKED AT HER KINSWOMAN AND OWNED SORROWFULLY TO HERSELF THAT SHE WAS QUITE INFERIOR IN TASTE TO MISSUS BECKY
DESCENDED AND WENT INTO CURZON STREET HIS SWORD BETWEEN HIS LEGS LITTLE RAWDON STOOD WITH HIS FACE AGAINST THE PARLOUR WINDOW PANES SMILING AND NODDING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO HIS AUNT IN THE CARRIAGE WITHIN
YOU MAY GO AND DINE WITH THEM AS YOU LIKE YOUR RUBBER BUT I MUSTN'T AND WON'T
HER COMPLEXION COULD BEAR ANY SUNSHINE AS YET AND HER DRESS THOUGH IF YOU WERE TO SEE IT NOW ANY PRESENT LADY OF VANITY FAIR WOULD PRONOUNCE IT TO BE THE MOST FOOLISH AND PREPOSTEROUS ATTIRE EVER WORN WAS AS HANDSOME IN HER EYES AND THOSE OF THE PUBLIC
BECKY WOULD NOT CONSORT ANY LONGER WITH THESE DUBIOUS ONES AND CUT LADY CRACKENBURY WHEN THE LATTER NODDED TO HER FROM HER OPERA BOX AND GAVE MISSUS WASHINGTON WHITE THE GO BY IN THE RING ONE MUST MY DEAR SHOW ONE IS SOMEBODY SHE SAID
AND PRESENTLY SIR PITT ISSUED FORTH FROM THE HOUSE AGAIN LEADING FORTH A LADY WITH GRAND FEATHERS COVERED IN A WHITE SHAWL AND HOLDING UP DAINTILY A TRAIN OF MAGNIFICENT BROCADE SHE STEPPED INTO THE VEHICLE
MY LADY TUFTO MISSUS BUTE CRAWLEY IN THE COUNTRY AND OTHER LADIES WHO HAD COME INTO CONTACT WITH MISSUS RAWDON CRAWLEY TO CRY FIE AT THE IDEA OF THE ODIOUS LITTLE ADVENTURESS MAKING HER CURTSEY BEFORE THE SOVEREIGN
SHE AMUSED AND SOMEWHAT PESTERED HER ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER PERPETUAL TALK ABOUT HIS URBANITY AND BEAUTY WHO KNOWS PERHAPS THE LITTLE WOMAN THOUGHT SHE MIGHT PLAY THE PART OF A MAINTENON OR A POMPADOUR
TO HER OWN LITTLE PERSON BRIGGS SAW HER TAKE THEM ASKED NO QUESTIONS TOLD NO STORIES BUT I BELIEVE QUITE SYMPATHISED WITH HER ON THIS MATTER AND SO WOULD MANY ANOTHER HONEST WOMAN AND THE DIAMONDS
THE BROCADE WAS AN OLD REMNANT BECKY SAID AND AS FOR THE LACE IT WAS A GREAT BARGAIN SHE HAD HAD IT THESE HUNDRED YEARS MY DEAR MISSUS CRAWLEY
KNEW WHENCE THE JEWELS CAME AND WHO PAID FOR THEM AS HE BOWED OVER HER HE SMILED
WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN REBECCA CRAWLEY
AND I HEARD THE BEDROOM DOOR OPEN AND THEN YOU CAME DOWNSTAIRS
OF HER PRESENTATION TO THE SOVEREIGN
AH WHAT SHALL I DO LORD STEYNE FOR I AM VERY VERY UNHAPPY LORD STEYNE MADE NO REPLY EXCEPT BY BEATING THE DEVIL'S TATTOO AND BITING HIS NAILS AT LAST HE CLAPPED HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD AND FLUNG OUT OF THE ROOM
TO WAIT UPON HIS MAJESTY BECAUSE MY OWN CARRIAGE IS NOT FORTHCOMING IT APPEARS THERE HAD BEEN A DIFFERENCE ON THE LAST DRAWING ROOM DAY HENCE THE DEGRADATION WHICH THE COLONEL HAD ALMOST SUFFERED OF BEING OBLIGED TO ENTER THE PRESENCE OF HIS SOVEREIGN IN A HACK CAB
BUT THE FINEST SPORT OF ALL AFTER HER PRESENTATION WAS TO HEAR HER TALK VIRTUOUSLY
ANSWERED MISSUS RAWDON PLAINTIVELY AND SHE RUBBED HER CHEEK WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF AS IF TO SHOW THERE WAS NO ROUGE AT ALL ONLY GENUINE BLUSHES AND MODESTY IN HER CASE ABOUT THIS WHO CAN TELL
THE LADIES NOT VERY BIG THEY WOULD HOLD THEIR TRAINS IN THEIR LAPS FINALLY THE FOUR WENT FRATERNALLY TOGETHER AND THEIR CARRIAGE PRESENTLY JOINED THE LINE OF ROYAL EQUIPAGES WHICH WAS MAKING ITS WAY DOWN PICCADILLY
YOU WILL GO TO GAUNT HOUSE YOU GIVE AN OLD FELLOW NO REST UNTIL YOU GET THERE IT'S NOT HALF SO NICE AS HERE YOU'LL BE BORED THERE I AM MY WIFE IS AS GAY AS LADY MACBETH AND MY DAUGHTERS AS CHEERFUL AS REGAN AND GONERIL
HE SAID GOOD NATUREDLY YOU SILLY LITTLE FIBSTER I HEARD YOU IN THE ROOM OVERHEAD WHERE I HAVE NO DOUBT YOU WERE PUTTING A LITTLE ROUGE ON YOU MUST GIVE SOME OF YOURS TO MY LADY GAUNT WHOSE COMPLEXION IS QUITE PREPOSTEROUS
MISSUS RAWDON AT LENGTH HAD PITY UPON HER ADMIRER AND CALLING TO BRIGGS PRAISED THE FINENESS OF THE WEATHER TO HER AND BADE HER TO TAKE OUT THE CHILD FOR A WALK I CAN'T SEND HER AWAY BECKY SAID PRESENTLY
IN A MODEST DRESS WITH A VEIL ON WHIPPED OFF IN A HACKNEY COACH TO THE CITY AND BEING LANDED AT MESSRS JONES AND ROBINSON'S BANK
AS ONE UNCHARITABLE TO HER KINSWOMAN AND YET IF LADY JANE HAD KNOWN ALL I THINK EVEN HER KINDLY TEMPER WOULD HAVE FAILED HER THE FACT IS WHEN SHE WAS PUTTING SIR PITT'S HOUSE IN ORDER
SOME LADIES WE MAY HAVE SEEN WE WHO WEAR STARS AND CORDONS AND ATTEND THE SAINT JAMES'S ASSEMBLIES OR WE WHO IN MUDDY BOOTS DAWDLE UP AND DOWN PALL MALL AND PEEP INTO THE COACHES AS THEY DRIVE UP WITH THE GREAT FOLKS IN THEIR FEATHERS SOME LADIES OF FASHION
ANOTHER GREAT AND EXCEEDING HONOUR WAS VOUCHSAFED TO THE VIRTUOUS BECKY LADY STEYNE'S CARRIAGE DROVE UP TO MISTER RAWDON CRAWLEY'S DOOR AND THE FOOTMAN INSTEAD OF DRIVING DOWN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AS BY HIS TREMENDOUS KNOCKING HE APPEARED TO BE INCLINED TO DO
LAUGHING MISCHIEVOUSLY AND HAVING ENJOYED FOR SOME TIME THE DISCOMFITURE OF MY LORD WHO HATED POOR BRIGGS FOR INTERRUPTING
COMING TO CALL A COUPLE OF HOURS AFTERWARDS AND LOOKING ABOUT HIM AND OBSERVING EVERYTHING AS WAS HIS WONT FOUND HIS LADIES CARDS ALREADY RANGED AS THE TRUMPS OF BECKY'S HAND AND GRINNED
ALONG WITH ALL PREVIOUS VANITIES BUT WE ARE WANDERING TOO MUCH MISSUS RAWDON'S DRESS WAS PRONOUNCED TO BE CHARMANTE ON THE EVENTFUL DAY OF HER PRESENTATION
AND BREECHES AND SILK STOCKINGS SIMPERING ON A SOFA FROM UNDER HIS CURLY BROWN WIG SHE HAD HIM PAINTED IN A BROOCH AND WORE IT
WITH BRILLIANCE AND PROFUSION BECKY BLUSHED A LITTLE AND LOOKED AT HIM HARD FOR A MOMENT PITT CRAWLEY BLUSHED A LITTLE TOO AND LOOKED OUT OF WINDOW THE FACT IS HE HAD GIVEN HER A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE BRILLIANTS A PRETTY DIAMOND CLASP
YOU'LL BE ASKED TO DINNER NEXT WEEK AND GARE AUX FEMMES LOOK OUT AND HOLD YOUR OWN HOW THE WOMEN WILL BULLY YOU THIS WAS A VERY LONG SPEECH FOR A MAN OF FEW WORDS LIKE MY LORD STEYNE
PASSES SHOULD APPEAR ABROAD AT NIGHT ALONE IF EVEN CYNTHIA LOOKS HAGGARD OF AN AFTERNOON AS WE MAY SEE HER SOMETIMES IN THE PRESENT WINTER SEASON
OF COUNTENANCE FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEAVENS HOW MUCH MORE CAN OLD LADY CASTLEMOULDY
WHO WAS WATCHING FROM HIS GREENGROCER'S SHOP AND SAW FINE PLUMES WITHIN AND ENORMOUS BUNCHES OF FLOWERS IN THE BREASTS OF THE NEW LIVERY COATS OF THE FOOTMEN SIR PITT IN A GLITTERING UNIFORM
AND AS DUBIOUS GOODS OR LETTERS ARE PASSED THROUGH AN OVEN AT QUARANTINE SPRINKLED WITH
BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT IT WAS THE FIRST GENTLEMAN IN EUROPE IN WHOSE HIGH PRESENCE MISSUS RAWDON PASSED HER EXAMINATION AND AS IT WERE TOOK HER DEGREE IN REPUTATION IT SURELY MUST BE FLAT DISLOYALTY
THERE CAME TWO NOTES FROM GAUNT HOUSE FOR THE LITTLE WOMAN THE ONE CONTAINING A CARD OF INVITATION FROM LORD AND LADY STEYNE TO A DINNER AT GAUNT HOUSE NEXT FRIDAY WHILE THE OTHER ENCLOSED A SLIP OF GRAY PAPER BEARING LORD STEYNE'S SIGNATURE AND THE ADDRESS OF MESSRS JONES
AND AUDACIOUSLY ABOUT THE SACRED AUDIENCE CHAMBER BUT TO BACK AWAY RAPIDLY SILENTLY AND RESPECTFULLY MAKING PROFOUND BOWS OUT OF THE AUGUST PRESENCE THIS MAY BE SAID
IN WHICH THE READER IS INTRODUCED TO THE VERY BEST OF COMPANY AT LAST BECKY'S KINDNESS AND ATTENTION TO THE CHIEF OF HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY
ASKED MEN DO THAT BECKY ANSWERED BITTERLY WOMEN ARE NOT SO BAD AS YOU
AND I HOPE THIS WILL BE A LESSON TO YOU SPAVIN SHE SAID AND THAT ON THE NEXT DRAWING ROOM DAY MY BROTHER SIR PITT
AND IN WHICH BECKY KEPT A NUMBER OF USEFUL AND PERHAPS VALUABLE THINGS
AS THIS OLD CYNIC ALWAYS DID AT ANY NAIVE DISPLAY OF HUMAN WEAKNESS BECKY CAME DOWN TO HIM PRESENTLY
HOW POOR MISSUS WASHINGTON WHITE'S CARD AND LADY CRACKENBURY'S CARD WHICH OUR LITTLE FRIEND HAD BEEN GLAD ENOUGH TO GET A FEW MONTHS BACK AND OF WHICH THE SILLY LITTLE CREATURE WAS RATHER PROUD ONCE LORD LORD I SAY
SHE GENTLY SAID SHE WOULD TAKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS IN SMALL NOTES AND THE REMAINDER IN ONE NOTE AND PASSING THROUGH SAINT PAUL'S CHURCHYARD STOPPED THERE AND BOUGHT THE HANDSOMEST BLACK SILK GOWN FOR BRIGGS WHICH MONEY COULD BUY AND WHICH
MISSUS RAWDON HAD FOUND THE LACE AND THE BROCADE IN OLD WARDROBES THE PROPERTY OF THE FORMER LADIES OF THE HOUSE AND HAD QUIETLY CARRIED THE GOODS HOME
AS IT MAY BE SEEN OF AN EARLY MORNING WHEN HALF THE LAMPS ARE OUT AND THE OTHERS ARE BLINKING WANLY AS IF THEY WERE ABOUT TO VANISH LIKE GHOSTS BEFORE THE DAWN SUCH CHARMS
ABOUT THE AIRS WHICH THAT WOMAN WAS GIVING HERSELF MISSUS BUTE CRAWLEY AND HER YOUNG LADIES IN THE COUNTRY HAD A COPY OF THE MORNING POST FROM TOWN
WHICH CONFINED A PEARL NECKLACE WHICH SHE WORE AND THE BARONET HAD OMITTED TO MENTION THE CIRCUMSTANCE TO HIS LADY BECKY LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND AND THEN AT SIR PITT WITH AN AIR OF SAUCY TRIUMPH AS MUCH AS TO SAY SHALL I BETRAY YOU
SO ELATED WAS SHE IN SPIRIT AND SO STRONG A SENSE HAD SHE OF THE DIGNIFIED POSITION WHICH SHE HAD AT LAST ATTAINED IN LIFE EVEN OUR BECKY HAD HER WEAKNESSES AND AS ONE OFTEN SEES HOW MEN PRIDE THEMSELVES UPON EXCELLENCES
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN IN VANITY FAIR WHEN THAT REVERED AND AUGUST BEING WAS INVESTED BY THE UNIVERSAL ACCLAIM OF THE REFINED AND EDUCATED PORTION OF THIS EMPIRE WITH THE TITLE OF PREMIER GENTILHOMME
SHOULD DRIVE UP IN CLOSED LITTERS
IF YOU DON'T TURN OFF THAT ABOMINABLE SHEEP DOG SAID LORD STEYNE WITH A SAVAGE LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER AT HER
SO TO BE AND TO BE THOUGHT A RESPECTABLE WOMAN WAS BECKY'S AIM IN LIFE AND SHE GOT UP THE GENTEEL WITH AMAZING ASSIDUITY READINESS AND SUCCESS WE HAVE SAID THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SHE BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE A FINE LADY
WHEN THIS ANGEL WAS ADMITTED INTO THE PARADISE OF A COURT WHICH SHE COVETED
NOR WAS IT THE FIRST WHICH HE UTTERED FOR BECKY'S BENEFIT ON THAT DAY BRIGGS LOOKED UP FROM THE WORK TABLE AT WHICH SHE WAS SEATED IN THE FARTHER ROOM AND GAVE A DEEP SIGH
THE PARTICULARS OF BECKY'S COSTUME WERE IN THE NEWSPAPERS FEATHERS LAPPETS SUPERB DIAMONDS AND ALL THE REST LADY CRACKENBURY READ THE PARAGRAPH IN BITTERNESS OF SPIRIT AND DISCOURSED TO HER FOLLOWERS
I COULDN'T COME BEFORE I WAS IN THE KITCHEN MAKING A PUDDING I KNOW YOU WERE I SAW YOU THROUGH THE AREA RAILINGS AS I DROVE UP REPLIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
AND FORGOT THAT THERE WAS NO MONEY IN THE CHEST AT HOME DUNS ROUND THE GATE TRADESMEN TO COAX AND WHEEDLE NO GROUND TO WALK UPON IN A WORD AND AS SHE WENT TO COURT IN THE CARRIAGE THE FAMILY CARRIAGE
WHERE THE DOOSE DID YOU GET THE DIAMONDS BECKY SAID HER HUSBAND ADMIRING SOME JEWELS
SHE GAVE US EVERYTHING SHE SHALL NEVER LEAVE ME UNTIL WE ARE RUINED UTTERLY OURSELVES
BE IT OUR REASONABLE BOAST TO OUR CHILDREN THAT WE SAW GEORGE THE GOOD THE MAGNIFICENT THE GREAT WELL THERE CAME A HAPPY DAY IN MISSUS RAWDON CRAWLEY'S EXISTENCE
THAT IN ALL LONDON THERE WAS NO MORE LOYAL HEART THAN BECKY'S AFTER THIS INTERVIEW THE NAME OF HER KING WAS ALWAYS ON HER LIPS AND HE WAS PROCLAIMED BY HER TO BE THE MOST CHARMING OF MEN SHE WENT TO COLNAGHI'S
THE CARRIAGE ROLLED DOWN THE STREET UNTIL ITS CARGO WAS FINALLY DISCHARGED AT THE GATES OF THE PALACE WHERE THE SOVEREIGN WAS SITTING IN STATE THE DIAMONDS WHICH HAD CREATED RAWDON'S ADMIRATION
HOW SOON AT THE APPEARANCE OF THESE GRAND COURT CARDS DID THOSE POOR LITTLE NEGLECTED DEUCES SINK DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK STEYNE BAREACRES JOHNES OF HELVELLYN AND CAERYLON OF CAMELOT
MANY A LADY WHOSE REPUTATION WOULD BE DOUBTFUL OTHERWISE AND LIABLE TO GIVE INFECTION PASSES THROUGH THE WHOLESOME ORDEAL OF THE ROYAL PRESENCE AND ISSUES FROM IT FREE FROM ALL TAINT
ON THE DRAWING ROOM TABLE WHERE BECKY KEPT THE CARDS OF HER VISITORS
TREMBLING AND COAXING WITH SMILES THE HUSBAND BY YOUR SIDE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE NEW VELVET GOWN FROM THE OLD ONE OR THE NEW BRACELET FROM LAST YEAR'S OR HAS ANY NOTION THAT THE RAGGED LOOKING YELLOW LACE SCARF COST FORTY GUINEAS
AFTER A PAUSE AND IN A VERY SAD VOICE HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS AS SHE SPOKE AND SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD
WITH WHICH TIME HAS MARKED HER FACE NO DRAWING ROOMS SHOULD BE ANNOUNCED FOR NOVEMBER
THEN SHE ROSE UP WITH THE QUEEREST EXPRESSION OF VICTORIOUS MISCHIEF GLITTERING IN HER GREEN EYES
AS LORD OF THE POWDER CLOSET AND ONE OF THE GREAT DIGNITARIES AND ILLUSTRIOUS DEFENCES OF THE THRONE OF ENGLAND AND CAME UP WITH ALL HIS STARS GARTERS COLLARS AND CORDONS AND PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE LITTLE WOMAN
AS THE LACED JACKETED BAND OF THE LIFE GUARDS ARE BLOWING TRIUMPHAL MARCHES SEATED ON THOSE PRANCING MUSIC STOOLS THEIR CREAM COLOURED CHARGERS WHO ARE BY NO MEANS LOVELY AND ENTICING OBJECTS
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT HAD SHE BEEN ONE SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME THE CHARACTER PERFECTLY
SOME FAINTED WITH EMOTION PEOPLE WERE SUFFOCATED IN THE PIT SHRIEKS AND GROANS RISING UP AMIDST THE WRITHING AND SHOUTING MASS THERE OF HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE AND INDEED SHOWED THEMSELVES ALMOST TO BE READY TO DIE FOR HIM
IT DOES NOT BECOME SUCH A FEEBLE AND INEXPERIENCED PEN AS MINE TO ATTEMPT TO RELATE THE DAZZLED EYES CLOSE BEFORE THAT MAGNIFICENT IDEA LOYAL RESPECT AND DECENCY TELL EVEN THE IMAGINATION NOT TO LOOK TOO KEENLY
A HUNDRED YARDS OF MALINES LACE ROLLED ROUND THEM WORTH TWICE THE NUMBER OF GUINEAS BECKY COULD NOT HAVE REGARDED THEM WITH MORE PLEASURE YOU MAY BE SURE THEY OCCUPIED A CONSPICUOUS PLACE IN THE CHINA BOWL
TO DOUBT ANY MORE ABOUT HER VIRTUE I FOR MY PART LOOK BACK WITH LOVE AND AWE TO THAT GREAT CHARACTER IN HISTORY AH WHAT A HIGH AND NOBLE APPRECIATION OF GENTLEWOMANHOOD
AND WE HAD NECK OF MUTTON AND TURNIPS
LOMBARD STREET RAWDON HEARD BECKY LAUGHING IN THE NIGHT ONCE OR TWICE IT WAS ONLY HER DELIGHT AT GOING TO GAUNT HOUSE AND FACING THE LADIES THERE SHE SAID WHICH AMUSED HER SO BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT SHE WAS OCCUPIED WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF OTHER THOUGHTS
OF HIS KINGDOM DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW THE HOUSE ROCKED AND SHOUTED WITH THAT MAGNIFICENT MUSIC HOW THEY CHEERED AND CRIED AND WAVED HANDKERCHIEFS LADIES WEPT
WHICH OTHERS ARE SLOW TO PERCEIVE HOW FOR INSTANCE COMUS FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT HE IS THE GREATEST TRAGIC ACTOR IN ENGLAND HOW BROWN THE FAMOUS NOVELIST LONGS TO BE CONSIDERED NOT A MAN OF GENIUS BUT A MAN OF FASHION
IF YOU HAD BEEN SANDY HAIRED GREEN EYED AND A FRENCH ROPE DANCER'S DAUGHTER MISSUS BUTE SAID TO HER ELDEST GIRL WHO ON THE CONTRARY WAS A VERY SWARTHY SHORT AND SNUB NOSED YOUNG LADY
SHE ADOPTED A DEMEANOUR SO GRAND SELF SATISFIED DELIBERATE AND IMPOSING THAT IT MADE EVEN LADY JANE LAUGH SHE WALKED INTO THE ROYAL APARTMENTS WITH A TOSS OF THE HEAD WHICH WOULD HAVE BEFITTED AN EMPRESS
THEN SHE WALKED TO MISTER RAGGLES INQUIRED ABOUT HIS CHILDREN AFFECTIONATELY AND GAVE HIM FIFTY POUNDS ON ACCOUNT THEN SHE WENT TO THE LIVERY MAN FROM WHOM SHE JOBBED HER CARRIAGES AND GRATIFIED HIM WITH A SIMILAR SUM
AT WHICH REBECCA HELD DOWN HER HEAD THE MORE AND CRIED BITTERLY I COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS MY ONLY CHANCE I DARE NOT TELL MY HUSBAND HE WOULD KILL ME IF I TOLD HIM WHAT I HAVE DONE I HAVE KEPT IT A SECRET FROM EVERYBODY BUT YOU AND YOU FORCED IT FROM ME
YES WE SAW HIM FATE CANNOT DEPRIVE US OF THAT OTHERS HAVE SEEN NAPOLEON SOME FEW STILL EXIST WHO HAVE BEHELD FREDERICK THE GREAT DOCTOR JOHNSON
AND ORDERED THE FINEST PORTRAIT OF HIM THAT ART HAD PRODUCED AND CREDIT COULD SUPPLY SHE CHOSE THAT FAMOUS ONE IN WHICH THE BEST OF MONARCHS IS REPRESENTED IN A FROCK COAT
AND SAINT JAMES'S STREET TOWARDS THE OLD BRICK PALACE WHERE THE STAR OF BRUNSWICK WAS IN WAITING TO RECEIVE HIS NOBLES AND GENTLEFOLKS BECKY FELT AS IF SHE COULD BLESS THE PEOPLE OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOWS
RELENTED AND ONLY DELIVERED IN A COUPLE OF CARDS ON WHICH WERE ENGRAVEN THE NAMES OF THE MARCHIONESS OF STEYNE AND THE COUNTESS OF GAUNT IF THESE BITS OF PASTEBOARD
AND MAKE THEIR CURTSEY TO THE SOVEREIGN UNDER THE PROTECTION OF LAMPLIGHT OUR BELOVED REBECCA HAD NO NEED HOWEVER OF ANY SUCH A FRIENDLY HALO TO SET OFF HER BEAUTY
TO KNOW NOTHING OR LITTLE IS IN THE NATURE OF SOME HUSBANDS TO HIDE IN THE NATURE OF HOW MANY WOMEN OH LADIES HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE SURREPTITIOUS MILLINERS BILLS HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE GOWNS AND BRACELETS WHICH YOU DAREN'T SHOW OR WHICH YOU WEAR TREMBLING
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THAT ALL THE DIAMONDS WHICH GO TO COURT BELONG TO THE WEARERS LIKE THOSE BEAUTIFUL STONES WHICH LADY JANE HAS AND WHICH ARE MUCH HANDSOMER THAN ANY WHICH I HAVE I AM CERTAIN
NEVER WENT BACK TO MISTER POLONIUS OF COVENTRY STREET AND THAT GENTLEMAN NEVER APPLIED FOR THEIR RESTORATION BUT THEY RETIRED INTO A LITTLE PRIVATE REPOSITORY IN AN OLD DESK WHICH AMELIA SEDLEY HAD GIVEN HER YEARS AND YEARS AGO
AND THAT MADAME BOBINOT IS WRITING DUNNING LETTERS EVERY WEEK FOR THE MONEY THUS RAWDON KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE BRILLIANT DIAMOND EAR RINGS OR THE SUPERB BRILLIANT ORNAMENT WHICH DECORATED THE FAIR BOSOM OF HIS LADY BUT LORD STEYNE WHO WAS IN HIS PLACE AT COURT
I DAREN'T SLEEP IN WHAT THEY CALL MY BEDROOM THE BED IS LIKE THE BALDAQUIN OF SAINT PETER'S AND THE PICTURES FRIGHTEN ME I HAVE A LITTLE BRASS BED IN A DRESSING ROOM AND A LITTLE HAIR MATTRESS LIKE AN ANCHORITE I AM AN ANCHORITE
AND TO TRIP DOWN AGAIN TO WAIT UPON THE GREAT PEER SHE FOUND HIM GRINNING OVER THE BOWL SHE WAS DISCOVERED AND SHE BLUSHED A LITTLE THANK YOU MONSEIGNEUR SHE SAID
THE HYPOCRITE BEING ACTED ELLISTON BEING MANAGER DOWTON AND LISTON PERFORMERS TWO BOYS HAD LEAVE FROM THEIR LOYAL MASTERS TO GO OUT FROM SLAUGHTER HOUSE SCHOOL WHERE THEY WERE EDUCATED
UNTIL SHE HAS PUT ON A TRAIN AND FEATHERS AND HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO HER SOVEREIGN AT COURT FROM THAT AUGUST INTERVIEW THEY COME OUT STAMPED AS HONEST WOMEN THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN GIVES THEM A CERTIFICATE OF VIRTUE
AND OTHER GREAT OFFICERS OF STATE WERE BEHIND THE CHAIR ON WHICH HE SAT HE SAT FLORID OF FACE PORTLY OF PERSON COVERED WITH ORDERS AND IN A RICH CURLING HEAD OF HAIR HOW WE SANG GOD SAVE HIM
WHICH WAS NOT NEARLY SO GOOD AND THEN EXAMINING THE QUALITY OF THE ANCIENT BROCADE WHICH FORMED THE MATERIAL OF MISSUS RAWDON'S COURT DRESS SHE FELT INCLINED TO SAY THAT SHE COULD NOT AFFORD SUCH FINE CLOTHING BUT CHECKED THAT SPEECH WITH AN EFFORT
YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD SUPERB DIAMONDS FORSOOTH AND HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AT COURT BY YOUR COUSIN THE LADY JANE
IN THEIR GREAT FAMILY CARRIAGE JUST NEWLY BUILT AND READY FOR THE BARONET'S ASSUMPTION OF THE OFFICE OF HIGH SHERIFF OF HIS COUNTY DROVE UP TO THE LITTLE HOUSE IN CURZON STREET TO THE EDIFICATION OF RAGGLES
A STOUT COUNTESS OF SIXTY DECOLLETEE PAINTED WRINKLED WITH ROUGE UP TO HER DROOPING EYELIDS AND DIAMONDS TWINKLING IN HER WIG IS A WHOLESOME AND EDIFYING BUT NOT A PLEASANT SIGHT
MESSRS JONES AND ROBINSON'S
AS IF SHE WERE A PRINCESS AND ACCUSTOMED ALL HER LIFE TO GO TO COURT SMILING GRACIOUSLY ON THE FOOTMAN AT THE DOOR AND ON SIR PITT WHO FOLLOWED HER INTO THE CARRIAGE THEN RAWDON FOLLOWED IN HIS OLD GUARDS UNIFORM
WE MAY BE SURE THAT BECKY AND BRIGGS LOOKED OUT THOSE AUGUST NAMES IN THE PEERAGE AND FOLLOWED THE NOBLE RACES UP THROUGH ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE FAMILY TREE MY LORD STEYNE
AND TO APPEAR ON DRURY LANE STAGE AMONGST A CROWD WHICH ASSEMBLED THERE TO GREET THE KING THE KING THERE HE WAS BEEFEATERS WERE BEFORE THE AUGUST BOX THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE LORD OF THE POWDER CLOSET
AND TO DECLARE THAT IF DEAR GOOD QUEEN CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN ALIVE SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE ADMITTED SUCH AN EXTREMELY ILL REGULATED PERSONAGE
NOT IT MUST BE OWNED OF THE VERY HIGHEST REPUTATION IN VANITY FAIR
WORSE THAN THAT SAID BECKY STILL CASTING DOWN HER EYES I HAVE RUINED HER RUINED HER
SHOULD SHE PAY OFF OLD BRIGGS AND GIVE HER HER CONGE SHOULD SHE ASTONISH RAGGLES BY SETTLING HIS ACCOUNT SHE TURNED OVER ALL THESE THOUGHTS ON HER PILLOW
WHY YOU SILLY MAN SHE CONTINUED WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE I GOT THEM ALL EXCEPT THE LITTLE CLASP WHICH A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE GAVE ME LONG AGO I HIRED THEM TO BE SURE I HIRED THEM AT MISTER POLONIUS'S IN COVENTRY STREET
I KNOW THERE IS SOME ROUGE THAT WON'T COME OFF ON A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF AND SOME SO GOOD THAT EVEN TEARS WILL NOT DISTURB IT WELL SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN TWIDDLING ROUND HIS WIFE'S CARD YOU ARE BENT ON BECOMING A FINE LADY
IF SHE DID NOT WISH TO LEAD A VIRTUOUS LIFE AT LEAST SHE DESIRED TO ENJOY A CHARACTER FOR VIRTUE AND WE KNOW THAT NO LADY IN THE GENTEEL WORLD
THESE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED BECKY PAID A VISIT UPSTAIRS TO THE BEFORE MENTIONED DESK WHICH AMELIA SEDLEY HAD GIVEN HER YEARS AND YEARS AGO AND WHICH CONTAINED A NUMBER OF USEFUL AND VALUABLE LITTLE THINGS IN WHICH PRIVATE MUSEUM SHE PLACED THE ONE NOTE WHICH
YOU POOR LITTLE EARTHENWARE PIPKIN YOU WANT TO SWIM DOWN THE STREAM ALONG WITH THE GREAT COPPER KETTLES
MY UNCLE AND AUNT AND I WERE TO GO TOGETHER AND THE OTHERS WERE TO MEET US AT THE CHURCH WELL MONDAY MORNING CAME AND I WAS IN SUCH A FUSS I WAS SO AFRAID YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO PUT IT OFF
BUT NO SUCH HAPPY MARRIAGE COULD NOW TEACH THE ADMIRING MULTITUDE WHAT CONNUBIAL FELICITY REALLY WAS
COMRADE B HAD TO LAY IT ON REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE IN AMERICA AS POSSIBLY YOU ARE AWARE THERE IS A REGULAR POST OF MISTAKE CLERK WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO RECEIVE IN THE NECK ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO BE COMING ALONG WHEN CUSTOMERS MAKE COMPLAINTS HE IS HAULED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE FOAMING CUSTOMER
I HAVE WRITTEN TO COLONEL FORSTER TO INFORM HIM OF OUR PRESENT ARRANGEMENTS AND TO REQUEST THAT HE WILL SATISFY THE VARIOUS CREDITORS OF MISTER WICKHAM IN AND NEAR BRIGHTON
TELL ME ALL HE LISTENED GRAVELY WHILE MIKE RELATED THE INCIDENTS WHICH HAD LED UP TO HIS CONFESSION AND THE RESULTS OF THE SAME AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE NARRATIVE HE SIPPED HIS COFFEE IN SILENCE FOR A MOMENT
JACKSON HE SAID MIKE CAME FORWARD DO YOU REMEMBER HE SPOKE SLOWLY AND WITH AN EFFORT
HE MURMURED MUSINGLY I HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT COMRADE WALLER'S MISFORTUNES CANNOT BUT BE TRIVIAL COMPARED WITH MINE BUT POSSIBLY IT WILL BE AS WELL TO ASCERTAIN THEIR NATURE I WILL REEL ROUND AND MAKE INQUIRIES GOOD MAN SAID MIKE
THIS WAS ONE POINT WITH REGARD TO LYDIA AT LEAST WHICH WAS NOW TO BE SETTLED AND MISTER BENNET COULD HAVE NO HESITATION IN ACCEDING TO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE HIM IN TERMS OF GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENT FOR THE KINDNESS OF HIS BROTHER THOUGH EXPRESSED MOST CONCISELY
THAN TO ANY SENSE OF SHAME AT HER ELOPING AND LIVING WITH WICKHAM A FORTNIGHT BEFORE THEY TOOK PLACE
PSMITH MAKES INQUIRIES PSMITH AS WAS HIS HABIT OF A MORNING WHEN THE FIERCE RUSH OF HIS COMMERCIAL DUTIES HAD ABATED SOMEWHAT WAS LEANING GRACEFULLY AGAINST HIS DESK
WHO BELIEVED THAT THE EARTH WAS FLAT AND ADDRESSED MEETINGS ON THE SUBJECT IN HYDE PARK ON SUNDAYS AND MANY OTHERS
HOW DO THESE IDEAS GET ABOUT I YIELD TO NOBODY IN MY RESPECT FOR OUR MANAGER I MAY HAVE HAD OCCASION FROM TIME TO TIME TO CORRECT HIM IN SOME TRIFLING MATTER
THOUGH I WAS THERE A FORTNIGHT NOT ONE PARTY OR SCHEME OR ANYTHING
THEIR SISTER'S WEDDING DAY ARRIVED AND JANE AND ELIZABETH FELT FOR HER PROBABLY MORE THAN SHE FELT FOR HERSELF THE CARRIAGE WAS SENT TO MEET THEM AT AND THEY WERE TO RETURN IN IT BY DINNER TIME THEIR ARRIVAL WAS DREADED BY THE ELDER MISS BENNETS AND JANE MORE ESPECIALLY
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHAT THEY WOULD SAY ABOUT THIS AT HOME UP TILL NOW THE MATTER HAD SEEMED ENTIRELY A PERSONAL ONE
GAVE HER HAND WITH AN AFFECTIONATE SMILE TO WICKHAM WHO FOLLOWED HIS LADY AND WISHED THEM BOTH JOY WITH AN ALACRITY WHICH SHEWED NO DOUBT OF THEIR HAPPINESS THEIR RECEPTION FROM MISTER BENNET TO WHOM THEY THEN TURNED WAS NOT QUITE SO CORDIAL HIS COUNTENANCE RATHER GAINED IN AUSTERITY
THERE WAS A CURIOUSLY GREY TIRED LOOK ON HIS FACE MIKE COULD NOT MAKE IT OUT
IT EMBRACES A HUNDRED DEGREES OF MEANING MIKE HAD EXPECTED SENTENCE OF DISMISSAL AND HE HAD GOT IT SO FAR HE HAD NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF
MIKE WISHED HIM LUCK AND THERE WAS RAYMOND WHO DABBLED IN JOURNALISM AND WAS THE AUTHOR OF STRAIGHT TALKS TO HOUSEWIVES IN TRIFLES UNDER THE PSEUDONYM OF LADY GUSSIE WRAGGE
AGAIN WHAT COULD HE DO BY WAY OF EARNING A LIVING HE DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE CITY AND ITS WAYS BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUMMARY DISMISSAL FROM A BANK IS NOT THE BEST RECOMMENDATION ONE CAN PUT FORWARD IN APPLYING FOR ANOTHER JOB
EITHER A LITTLE MORE WORK OR MORE POTTERING ACCORDING TO WHETHER THERE WAS ANY WORK TO DO OR NOT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN UNPLEASANT MODE OF SPENDING A LATE JANUARY DAY THEN THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS AN INTERESTING LITTLE COMMUNITY THAT OF THE NEW ASIATIC BANK
THE HAPPY THOUGHT STRUCK HIM OF CONSULTING PSMITH IT WAS HIS HOUR FOR POTTERING
MISTER WALLER'S FACE HAD THE UNREASONABLE EFFECT ON HIM OF MAKING HIM FEEL SHY AND AWKWARD
BUT TO LIVE IN IGNORANCE ON SUCH A POINT WAS IMPOSSIBLE OR AT LEAST IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO TRY FOR INFORMATION
WE SHALL BE AT NEWCASTLE ALL THE WINTER AND I DARE SAY THERE WILL BE SOME BALLS AND I WILL TAKE CARE TO GET GOOD PARTNERS FOR THEM ALL I SHOULD LIKE IT BEYOND ANYTHING SAID HER MOTHER
HE RECOLLECTED THE MAN WHO HAD PRESENTED IT A TALLISH MAN WITH A BEARD
NOT HOWEVER FROM ANY FEAR OF DISADVANTAGE FROM IT INDIVIDUALLY TO HERSELF FOR AT ANY RATE THERE SEEMED A GULF IMPASSABLE BETWEEN THEM
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG MEN TOO THAT SHE LIKES VERY MUCH THE OFFICERS MAY NOT BE SO PLEASANT IN GENERAL REGIMENT HIS DAUGHTER'S REQUEST FOR SUCH IT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED OF BEING ADMITTED INTO HER FAMILY AGAIN BEFORE SHE SET OFF FOR THE NORTH
LOOK HERE SMITH SAID MIKE EARNESTLY FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON'T GO PLAYING THE GOAT THERE'S NO EARTHLY NEED FOR YOU TO GET LUGGED INTO THIS BUSINESS DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT ME I SHALL BE ALL RIGHT I THINK SAID PSMITH THAT YOU WILL
SHE BEGAN NOW TO COMPREHEND THAT HE WAS EXACTLY THE MAN WHO IN DISPOSITION AND TALENTS WOULD MOST SUIT HER HIS UNDERSTANDING AND TEMPER THOUGH UNLIKE HER OWN WOULD HAVE ANSWERED ALL HER WISHES
HE HAD THUNDERED AT MIKE AS IF MIKE HAD BEEN HIS MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT OR THE ENCROACHING ALIEN OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT AND THAT KIND OF THING IS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING AT SHORT RANGE MIKE'S HEAD WAS STILL SPINNING IT CONTINUED TO SPIN
THE WHOLE PRESSURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE SEEMED TO LIFT HE SAW A WAY OUT IT WAS A CURIOUS CROOKED WAY BUT AT THAT MOMENT IT STRETCHED CLEAR AND BROAD BEFORE HIM HE FELT LIGHTHEARTED AND EXCITED AS IF HE WERE WATCHING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME INTERESTING PLAY AT THE THEATRE HE GOT UP
FOR THESE HE WAS PREPARED WHAT HE DID NOT EXPECT WAS ANY BIG CALAMITY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF IT THE SKY WAS BLUE AND FREE FROM ALL SUGGESTIONS OF APPROACHING THUNDERBOLTS
AND MISSUS BENNET FOUND WITH AMAZEMENT AND HORROR THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD NOT ADVANCE A GUINEA TO BUY CLOTHES FOR HIS DAUGHTER HE PROTESTED THAT SHE SHOULD RECEIVE FROM HIM NO MARK OF AFFECTION WHATEVER ON THE OCCASION MISSUS BENNET COULD HARDLY COMPREHEND IT
WHAT MY CURIOSITY MUST BE TO KNOW HOW A PERSON UNCONNECTED WITH ANY OF US AND COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING A STRANGER TO OUR FAMILY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AMONGST YOU AT SUCH A TIME PRAY WRITE INSTANTLY AND LET ME UNDERSTAND IT
THAT INSTEAD OF SPENDING HIS WHOLE INCOME HE HAD LAID BY AN ANNUAL SUM FOR THE BETTER PROVISION OF HIS CHILDREN AND OF HIS WIFE IF SHE SURVIVED HIM HE NOW WISHED IT MORE THAN EVER HAD HE DONE HIS DUTY IN THAT RESPECT
WHICH I JOLLY WELL DID HE HAD STARTED JAWING JACKSON AGAIN BEFORE I WAS OUT OF THE ROOM WHILE APPLAUDING HIS HUSTLE SAID PSMITH I FEAR THAT I MUST TAKE OFFICIAL NOTICE OF THIS COMRADE JACKSON IS ESSENTIALLY A SENSITIVE PLANT HIGHLY STRUNG
HE NEVER WISHED TO HEAR THE NAME AGAIN WE DO NOT CLAIM ORIGINALITY FOR THE STATEMENT THAT THINGS NEVER HAPPEN QUITE AS ONE EXPECTS THEM TO WE REPEAT IT NOW BECAUSE OF ITS PROFOUND TRUTH THE EDWARD'S PNEUMONIA EPISODE HAVING ENDED SATISFACTORILY
I PROMISED THEM SO FAITHFULLY WHAT WILL WICKHAM SAY IT WAS TO BE SUCH A SECRET IF IT WAS TO BE SECRET SAID JANE SAY NOT ANOTHER WORD ON THE SUBJECT YOU MAY DEPEND UPON MY SEEKING NO FURTHER OH CERTAINLY SAID ELIZABETH
COULD BE SPUN OUT FROM HALF PAST TWELVE TO TWO MORE WORK FROM TWO TILL HALF PAST THREE FROM HALF PAST THREE TILL HALF PAST FOUR TEA IN THE TEAROOM WITH A NOVEL
CONCERNING A CHEQUE THINGS NEVER HAPPEN QUITE AS ONE EXPECTS THEM TO MIKE CAME TO THE OFFICE NEXT MORNING PREPARED FOR A REPETITION OF THE PREVIOUS DAY HE WAS AMAZED TO FIND THE CASHIER NOT MERELY CHEERFUL BUT EVEN EXUBERANTLY CHEERFUL
HE GREETED CUSTOMERS WITH BRIGHT REMARKS ON THE WEATHER AND SNAPPY VIEWS ON THE LEADING EVENTS OF THE DAY THE FORMER TINGED WITH OPTIMISM THE LATTER FULL OF A GENTLE SPIRIT OF TOLERATION
OH MAMMA DO THE PEOPLE HEREABOUTS KNOW I AM MARRIED TO DAY I WAS AFRAID THEY MIGHT NOT AND WE OVERTOOK WILLIAM GOULDING IN HIS CURRICLE
AND CENTRED AND SANDY TURNBULL HEADED A BEAUTIFUL GOAL
HE IS FURIOUS MISTER BICKERSDYKE TOO THEY ARE BOTH FURIOUS I SHALL BE DISMISSED I SHALL LOSE MY PLACE I SHALL BE DISMISSED HE WAS TALKING MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO MIKE IT WAS DREADFUL TO SEE HIM SITTING THERE ALL LIMP AND BROKEN
EXCEEDED ALL SHE COULD BELIEVE POSSIBLE
YET THERE IT IS ONCE MORE MIKE WAS TONGUE TIED FOR THE LIFE OF HIM HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY
WHERE HE FOUND THE OLD ETONIAN EYEING WITH DISFAVOUR A NEW SATIN TIE WHICH BRISTOW WAS WEARING THAT MORNING FOR THE FIRST TIME
BLOOMING HURRICANE MORE LIKE IT I WAS IN BICK'S ROOM JUST NOW WITH A LETTER TO SIGN AND I TELL YOU THE FUR WAS FLYING ALL OVER THE BALLY SHOP
BUT HE COULD FIND NOTHING THAT WOULD NOT SOUND HORRIBLY STILTED AND COLD HE SAT SILENT SIR JOHN IS IN THERE
IT IS WHEN THE DAYS ARE LONG AND THE SUN BEATS HOT ON THE PAVEMENT AND EVERYTHING SHOUTS TO HIM HOW SPLENDID IT IS OUT IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE BEGINS TO GROW RESTLESS
WE ALL HAVE OUR HOBBIES SAID PSMITH JACKSON WASN'T SAYING MUCH HE JOLLY WELL HADN'T A CHANCE OLD BICK WAS SHOOTING IT OUT FOURTEEN TO THE DOZEN I HAVE BEEN PRIVILEGED SAID PSMITH TO HEAR COMRADE BICKERSDYKE SPEAK BOTH IN HIS SANCTUM AND IN PUBLIC
NEUROTIC I CANNOT HAVE HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM JOLTED AND DISORGANIZED IN THIS MANNER AND HIS VALUE AS A CONFIDENTIAL SECRETARY AND ADVISER IMPAIRED EVEN THOUGH IT BE ONLY TEMPORARILY I MUST LOOK INTO THIS I WILL GO AND SEE IF THE ORGY IS CONCLUDED
YOU MUST DROP IT COMRADE JACKSON WHEN YOU WERE FREE AND WITHOUT TIES IT DID NOT SO MUCH MATTER
THE SITUATION WAS TICKLING HIM MISTER WALLER HAS TOLD ME HE BEGAN I HAVE ALREADY SEEN MISTER WALLER I KNOW HE TOLD ME ABOUT THE CHEQUE I CAME TO EXPLAIN EXPLAIN YES
WALLER WAS UP ALL NIGHT HE OUGHTN'T TO BE HERE AT ALL TODAY HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING HALF THE TIME HE'S ABSOLUTELY FAGGED OUT LOOK HERE YOU'D BETTER NIP BACK AND DO AS MUCH OF THE WORK AS YOU CAN I SHOULDN'T TALK TO HIM MUCH IF I WERE YOU BUCK ALONG MIKE WENT
THEY MUST ALL GO TO BRIGHTON THAT IS THE PLACE TO GET HUSBANDS WHAT A PITY IT IS MAMMA WE DID NOT ALL GO VERY TRUE AND IF I HAD MY WILL WE SHOULD BUT MY DEAR LYDIA I DON'T AT ALL LIKE YOUR GOING SUCH A WAY OFF MUST IT BE SO
WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TURMOIL I COULDN'T WAIT TO HEAR I WAS TOO JOLLY GLAD TO GET AWAY OLD BICK LOOKED AT ME AS IF HE COULD EAT ME
HIS LIFE WAS VERY REGULAR
HE'S GETTING IT HOT ON THE CARPET YOU WISH TO INDICATE SAID PSMITH THAT THERE IS SOME SLIGHT DISTURBANCE SOME PASSING BREEZE BETWEEN COMRADES JACKSON AND BICKERSDYKE BRISTOW CHUCKLED BREEZE
BUT MY ABSENCE WILL NOT SPELL IRRETRIEVABLE RUIN AS IT WOULD AT A PERIOD OF GREATER COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY COMRADES ROSSITER AND BRISTOW HAVE STUDIED MY METHODS THEY KNOW HOW I LIKE THINGS TO BE DONE THEY ARE FULLY COMPETENT TO CONDUCT THE BUSINESS OF THE DEPARTMENT IN MY ABSENCE
MOST OF THE GOALS TOWARDS WHICH THE AVERAGE MAN STRIVES STRUCK HIM AS TOO UNAMBITIOUS FOR THE PRODIGY
FOCUSING HIS ATTENTION WITH SOME RELUCTANCE UPON THIS BLOT ON THE HORIZON HE DISCOVERED THAT THE EXPLOITER OF RAINBOW WAISTCOATS AND SATIN TIES WAS ADDRESSING HIM I SAY SMITHY SAID BRISTOW HE SPOKE IN RATHER AN AWED VOICE
MISTER GARDINER SOON WROTE AGAIN TO HIS BROTHER TO MISTER BENNET'S ACKNOWLEDGMENTS HE BRIEFLY REPLIED WITH ASSURANCE OF HIS EAGERNESS TO PROMOTE THE WELFARE OF ANY OF HIS FAMILY
LYDIA NEED NOT HAVE BEEN INDEBTED TO HER UNCLE FOR WHATEVER OF HONOUR OR CREDIT COULD NOW BE PURCHASED FOR HER THE SATISFACTION OF PREVAILING ON ONE OF THE MOST WORTHLESS YOUNG MEN IN GREAT BRITAIN TO BE HER HUSBAND MIGHT THEN HAVE RESTED IN ITS PROPER PLACE
PSMITH STIRRED HIS COFFEE BEFORE REPLYING
HE THEN DELIVERED ON PAPER HIS PERFECT APPROBATION OF ALL THAT WAS DONE
I SHALL LOSE MY PLACE MISTER BICKERSDYKE HAS WANTED TO GET RID OF ME FOR A LONG TIME HE NEVER LIKED ME I SHALL BE DISMISSED WHAT CAN I DO I'M AN OLD MAN
NOW HAPPILY RECONCILED TO ADA WITH AN INGENIOUS VERBAL CATCH
MIKE FOUND HIMSELF BY DEGREES GROWING QUITE ATTACHED TO THE NEW ASIATIC BANK ONE MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY
AND THE CASHIER PUTTING ON HIS COAT AND HAT PASSED SILENTLY OUT THROUGH THE SWING DOORS HE WALKED LISTLESSLY HE WAS EVIDENTLY TIRED OUT MIKE SHUT HIS LEDGER WITH A VICIOUS BANG AND WENT ACROSS TO FIND PSMITH HE WAS GLAD THE DAY WAS OVER
LOST BUT A LITTLE OF THEIR SPIRIT IN THIS CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE WITH SUCH AN HUSBAND HER MISERY WAS CONSIDERED CERTAIN
AND TO REALIZE THAT HIS BLUNT SPEECH WAS LARGELY DUE TO SHYNESS IN SPITE OF HIS PREJUDICE AGAINST EDWARD
HOW WICKHAM AND LYDIA WERE TO BE SUPPORTED IN TOLERABLE INDEPENDENCE SHE COULD NOT IMAGINE BUT HOW LITTLE OF PERMANENT HAPPINESS COULD BELONG TO A COUPLE WHO WERE ONLY BROUGHT TOGETHER BECAUSE THEIR PASSIONS WERE STRONGER THAN THEIR VIRTUE SHE COULD EASILY CONJECTURE
HE DIDN'T CASH IT AT ALL I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU MISTER JACKSON I WAS AT THE COUNTER WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT IN SAID MIKE I CASHED IT
THE HEAD OF THE CASH DEPARTMENT WAS AS A RULE MILDLY CHEERFUL ON ARRIVAL AND APT EXCESSIVELY MIKE THOUGHT THOUGH HE ALWAYS LISTENED WITH POLITE INTEREST TO RELATE THE MOST RECENT SAYINGS AND DOINGS OF HIS SNUB NOSED SON EDWARD
YOU BEGIN IN A SMALL WAY BY BREAKING SCHOOL RULES TO EXTRACT COMRADE JELLICOE PERHAPS THE SUPREMEST OF ALL THE BLITHERERS I HAVE EVER MET FROM A HOLE IF YOU HAD STOPPED THERE ALL MIGHT HAVE BEEN WELL BUT THE THING ONCE STARTED FASCINATED YOU
SHE REPENTED THOUGH SHE HARDLY KNEW OF WHAT SHE BECAME JEALOUS OF HIS ESTEEM WHEN SHE COULD NO LONGER HOPE TO BE BENEFITED BY IT SHE WANTED TO HEAR OF HIM WHEN THERE SEEMED THE LEAST CHANCE OF GAINING INTELLIGENCE
OH IT'S HARD I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT ON ANY OTHER DAY BUT THAT I COULD NOT HAVE MISSED IT THEY SHOWED ME THE CHEQUE IN THERE JUST NOW I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I HAD PASSED IT I DON'T REMEMBER DOING IT MY MIND WAS FAR AWAY I DON'T REMEMBER THE CHEQUE OR ANYTHING ABOUT IT
FOR MY UNCLE WAS TO GIVE ME AWAY AND IF WE WERE BEYOND THE HOUR WE COULD NOT BE MARRIED ALL DAY BUT LUCKILY HE CAME BACK AGAIN IN TEN MINUTES TIME AND THEN WE ALL SET OUT
NO ACTION OF THIS YOUNG PRODIGY WAS WITHHELD FROM MIKE HE HAD HEARD ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS
HIS LETTER WAS SOON DISPATCHED FOR THOUGH DILATORY IN UNDERTAKING BUSINESS
SIR JOHN MORRISON'S SIGNATURE YES IT CAME IN THE MORNING RATHER LATE MIKE REMEMBERED THE CHEQUE PERFECTLY WELL OWING TO THE AMOUNT IT WAS THE ONLY THREE FIGURE CHEQUE WHICH HAD COME ACROSS THE COUNTER DURING THE DAY
BOTH ON HIS ACCOUNT AND MY NIECE'S IT IS MISTER WICKHAM'S INTENTION TO GO INTO THE REGULARS AND AMONG HIS FORMER FRIENDS THERE ARE STILL SOME WHO ARE ABLE AND WILLING TO ASSIST HIM IN THE ARMY HE HAS THE PROMISE OF AN ENSIGNCY IN GENERAL REGIMENT
I REGRET TO SEE YOU STILL FLAUNT IF IT IS ONE TITHE AS PAINFUL AS THAT YOU HAVE MY SYMPATHY JERK IT OUT COMRADE BRISTOW
WICKHAM WAS NOT AT ALL MORE DISTRESSED THAN HERSELF BUT HIS MANNERS WERE ALWAYS SO PLEASING THAT HAD HIS CHARACTER AND HIS MARRIAGE BEEN EXACTLY WHAT THEY OUGHT HIS SMILES AND HIS EASY ADDRESS
BUT ON THIS HAPPY DAY SHE AGAIN TOOK HER SEAT AT THE HEAD OF HER TABLE AND IN SPIRITS OPPRESSIVELY HIGH
AND THERE WAS MY AUNT
THE MARRIAGE OF A DAUGHTER WHICH HAD BEEN THE FIRST OBJECT OF HER WISHES SINCE JANE WAS SIXTEEN WAS NOW ON THE POINT OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AND HER THOUGHTS AND HER WORDS RAN WHOLLY ON THOSE ATTENDANTS OF ELEGANT NUPTIALS FINE MUSLINS NEW CARRIAGES AND SERVANTS
THE PRINCIPAL PURPORT OF HIS LETTER WAS TO INFORM THEM THAT MISTER WICKHAM HAD RESOLVED ON QUITTING THE MILITIA IT WAS GREATLY MY WISH THAT HE SHOULD DO SO HE ADDED AS SOON AS HIS MARRIAGE WAS FIXED ON
BUT HE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THE FACT ROUND WHICH IT REVOLVED
HAGGERSTON HAS OUR DIRECTIONS AND ALL WILL BE COMPLETED IN A WEEK THEY WILL THEN JOIN HIS REGIMENT UNLESS THEY ARE FIRST INVITED TO LONGBOURN AND I UNDERSTAND FROM MISSUS GARDINER THAT MY NIECE IS VERY DESIROUS OF SEEING YOU ALL BEFORE SHE LEAVES THE SOUTH
AND MISSUS BENNET FOR MANY YEARS AFTER LYDIA'S BIRTH HAD BEEN CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD THIS EVENT HAD AT LAST BEEN DESPAIRED OF BUT IT WAS THEN TOO LATE TO BE SAVING MISSUS BENNET HAD NO TURN FOR ECONOMY
AND MY DEAR AUNT IF YOU DO NOT TELL ME IN AN HONOURABLE MANNER I SHALL CERTAINLY BE REDUCED TO TRICKS AND STRATAGEMS TO FIND IT OUT JANE'S DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR WOULD NOT ALLOW HER TO SPEAK TO ELIZABETH PRIVATELY OF WHAT LYDIA HAD LET FALL ELIZABETH WAS GLAD OF IT
ALL HE COULD UNDERSTAND WAS THAT A FAR WORSE THING HAD HAPPENED THAN ANYTHING HE COULD HAVE IMAGINED A FORGERY HE SAID A FORGERY AND A CLUMSY ONE
LOOK HERE SMITH HE SAID I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU I'M IN A BIT OF A HOLE
MISTER DARCY REPEATED ELIZABETH
AND HER HUSBAND'S LOVE OF INDEPENDENCE HAD ALONE PREVENTED THEIR EXCEEDING THEIR INCOME FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS WAS SETTLED BY MARRIAGE ARTICLES ON MISSUS BENNET AND THE CHILDREN BUT IN WHAT PROPORTIONS IT SHOULD BE DIVIDED AMONGST THE LATTER DEPENDED ON THE WILL OF THE PARENTS
WHEN THE FIRST TRANSPORTS OF RAGE WHICH HAD PRODUCED HIS ACTIVITY IN SEEKING HER WERE OVER
WHY HE SAID IT WAS A FORGERY MUTTERED MISTER WALLER SITTING DOWN HEAVILY MIKE COULD NOT TAKE IT IN ALL AT ONCE HE WAS STUNNED
AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE DEFINITELY DECIDED THIS MORNING TO ABANDON ALL HOPE OF HIS REFORM
I THINK THERE CANNOT BE TOO LITTLE SAID ON THE SUBJECT LA
WHO HAD GENERALLY SOME FRESH GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE RING WEARING BRISTOW TO AIR FROM ELEVEN TO HALF PAST TWELVE HE WOULD PUT IN A LITTLE GENTLE WORK LUNCH
SMILING THE CASHIER DID NOT NOTICE THE MOVEMENT SOMEBODY HAD COME IN TO CASH A CHEQUE AND HE WAS WORKING MECHANICALLY
NO I PREFER TO THINK THAT COMRADE BICKERSDYKE REGARDS ME AS HIS FRIEND AND WELL WISHER AND WILL LEND A COURTEOUS EAR TO ANY PROPOSAL I SEE FIT TO MAKE I HOPE SHORTLY TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THIS TO YOU
THE PLACE WAS FULL OF QUAINT CHARACTERS THERE WAS WEST WHO HAD BEEN REQUESTED TO LEAVE HAILEYBURY OWING TO HIS HABIT OF BORROWING HORSES AND ATTENDING MEETS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
MISTER WICKHAM HAD RECEIVED HIS COMMISSION BEFORE HE LEFT LONDON AND HE WAS TO JOIN HIS REGIMENT AT THE END OF A FORTNIGHT NO ONE BUT MISSUS BENNET REGRETTED THAT THEIR STAY WOULD BE SO SHORT AND SHE MADE THE MOST OF THE TIME BY VISITING ABOUT WITH HER DAUGHTER AND HAVING VERY FREQUENT PARTIES AT HOME
MISTER WALLER STILL CHIRPY HAD NOTHING BUT GOOD NEWS OF EDWARD MIKE WENT FOR HIS MORNING STROLL ROUND THE OFFICE FEELING THAT THINGS HAD SETTLED DOWN AND HAD MADE UP THEIR MIND TO RUN SMOOTHLY WHEN HE GOT BACK BARELY HALF AN HOUR LATER THE STORM HAD BURST
BUT IF I FIND AS I SUSPECT THAT HE HAS WRONGED COMRADE JACKSON I SHALL BE FORCED TO SPEAK SHARPLY TO HIM MIKE HAD LEFT THE SCENE OF BATTLE BY THE TIME PSMITH REACHED THE CASH DEPARTMENT
WHAT WITH HER BOARD AND POCKET ALLOWANCE AND THE CONTINUAL PRESENTS IN MONEY WHICH PASSED TO HER THROUGH HER MOTHER'S HANDS LYDIA'S EXPENSES HAD BEEN VERY LITTLE WITHIN THAT SUM
PSMITH ROSE MIKE LED THE WAY TO A QUIET CORNER OF THE TELEGRAMS DEPARTMENT I TELL YOU COMRADE JACKSON SAID PSMITH I AM HARD PRESSED THE FIGHT IS BEGINNING TO BE TOO MUCH FOR ME
COULD HE KNOW THAT THE PROPOSALS WHICH SHE HAD PROUDLY SPURNED ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO WOULD NOW HAVE BEEN MOST GLADLY AND GRATEFULLY RECEIVED HE WAS AS GENEROUS SHE DOUBTED NOT AS THE MOST GENEROUS OF HIS SEX BUT WHILE HE WAS MORTAL THERE MUST BE A TRIUMPH
SHE TURNED FROM SISTER TO SISTER DEMANDING THEIR CONGRATULATIONS AND WHEN AT LENGTH THEY ALL SAT DOWN LOOKED EAGERLY ROUND THE ROOM
BEEN LED TO MAKE MISTER DARCY ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR FEARS FOR HER SISTER FOR SINCE HER MARRIAGE WOULD SO SHORTLY GIVE THE PROPER TERMINATION TO THE ELOPEMENT
I SHALL LIKE IT OF ALL THINGS
AS SOON AS HE SHOULD BE OF AGE AND THE WIDOW AND YOUNGER CHILDREN WOULD BY THAT MEANS BE PROVIDED FOR
HAD NOT HAD TO STAND THE TEST OF SUNSHINE AT PRESENT THE WEATHER BEING COLD AND DISMAL HE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY CONTENTED NOW THAT HE HAD GOT INTO THE SWING OF HIS WORK THE DAYS PASSED VERY QUICKLY AND WITH HIS LIFE AFTER OFFICE HOURS HE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND AT ALL
I SUCCEEDED YESTERDAY IN INDUCING THE MAN BRISTOW TO ABANDON THAT RAINBOW WAISTCOAT OF HIS TODAY I ENTER THE BUILDING BLYTHE AND BUOYANT WORN OF COURSE FROM THE LONG STRUGGLE BUT SEEING WITH ACHING EYES THE DAWN OF ANOTHER BETTER ERA
THERE WAS NO WANT OF DISCOURSE THE BRIDE AND HER MOTHER COULD NEITHER OF THEM TALK FAST ENOUGH AND WICKHAM WHO HAPPENED TO SIT NEAR ELIZABETH BEGAN INQUIRING AFTER HIS ACQUAINTANCE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD
SHE HAD NO FEAR OF ITS SPREADING FARTHER THROUGH HIS MEANS
HE CONFIDED TO MIKE HIS INTENTION OF LEAVING THE BANK AS SOON AS HE HAD MADE A NAME AND TAKING SERIOUSLY TO THE BUSINESS HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD KNOCKED THEM AT THE BEDFORD THE WEEK BEFORE AND IN SUPPORT OF THE STATEMENT SHOWED HIM A CUTTING FROM THE ERA IN WHICH THE WRITER SAID THAT
HE BEGGED TO KNOW FURTHER PARTICULARS OF WHAT HE WAS INDEBTED TO HIS BROTHER BUT WAS TOO ANGRY WITH LYDIA TO SEND ANY MESSAGE TO HER THE GOOD NEWS SPREAD QUICKLY THROUGH THE HOUSE AND WITH PROPORTIONATE SPEED THROUGH THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS BORNE IN THE LATTER WITH DECENT PHILOSOPHY
THAT WAS AT TEN O'CLOCK FROM TEN TO ELEVEN HE WOULD POTTER THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON AT THAT TIME IN HIS DEPARTMENT
SHE IS WELL AND BEGS TO BE DUTIFULLY REMEMBERED TO YOU AND YOUR MOTHER YOURS ET CETERA E GARDINER MISTER BENNET AND HIS DAUGHTERS SAW ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF WICKHAM'S REMOVAL FROM THE SHIRE
EDWARD IT APPEARED HAD RALLIED IN THE AFTERNOON
HE WENT ABOUT HIS DUTIES IN A COSTUME WHICH SUGGESTED THE SPORTSMAN OF THE COMIC PAPERS THERE WAS ALSO HIGNETT WHO ADDED TO THE MEAGRE SALARY ALLOWED HIM BY THE BANK BY SINGING COMIC SONGS AT THE MINOR MUSIC HALLS
THEY SEEMED EACH OF THEM TO HAVE THE HAPPIEST MEMORIES IN THE WORLD NOTHING OF THE PAST WAS RECOLLECTED WITH PAIN AND LYDIA LED VOLUNTARILY TO SUBJECTS WHICH HER SISTERS WOULD NOT HAVE ALLUDED TO FOR THE WORLD ONLY THINK OF ITS BEING THREE MONTHS SHE CRIED
MY TIME FROM NOW ONWARD IS HIS HE SHALL HAVE THE FULL EDUCATIVE VALUE OF MY EXCLUSIVE ATTENTION I GIVE COMRADE BRISTOW UP MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE CORNER FLAG YOU UNDERSTAND HE ADDED AS MISTER ROSSITER EMERGED FROM HIS LAIR
INTO ONE HOUSE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD THEY SHALL NEVER HAVE ADMITTANCE I WILL NOT ENCOURAGE THE IMPUDENCE OF EITHER BY RECEIVING THEM AT LONGBOURN A LONG DISPUTE FOLLOWED THIS DECLARATION BUT MISTER BENNET WAS FIRM IT SOON LED TO ANOTHER
NOBODY WILL TAKE AN OLD MAN LIKE ME HIS VOICE DIED AWAY THERE WAS A SILENCE MIKE SAT STARING MISERABLY IN FRONT OF HIM THEN QUITE SUDDENLY AN IDEA CAME TO HIM
IF ONE COULD ONLY FIND IT ALTOGETHER THE CLOUD HAD LIFTED FROM THE CASH DEPARTMENT ALL WAS JOY JOLLITY AND SONG THE ATTITUDE OF COMRADE WALLER SAID PSMITH
BUT ALL IS NOT YET LOST YOU MUST RECOLLECT THAT COMRADE BICKERSDYKE SPOKE IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT THAT GENEROUS TEMPERAMENT WAS STIRRED TO ITS DEPTHS HE DID NOT PICK HIS WORDS BUT CALM WILL SUCCEED STORM AND WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING YET
APPLIES FOR A RISE OF SALARY NOW POSSIBLY IN YOUR CASE IN MY CASE INTERRUPTED MIKE THERE WAS NONE OF THAT ROT BICKERSDYKE WASN'T PUTTING IT ON HE MEANT EVERY WORD
THE LITTLE THEATRE WAS OPEN WELL AND SO JUST AS THE CARRIAGE CAME TO THE DOOR MY
FOR WHICH I HAVE PLEDGED MYSELF AND WILL YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE OF CARRYING SIMILAR ASSURANCES TO HIS CREDITORS IN MERYTON OF WHOM I SHALL SUBJOIN A LIST ACCORDING TO HIS INFORMATION HE HAS GIVEN IN ALL HIS DEBTS I HOPE AT LEAST HE HAS NOT DECEIVED US
IS REASSURING I MAY NOW THINK OF MY OWN TROUBLES COMRADE BRISTOW HAS BLOWN INTO THE OFFICE TODAY IN PATENT LEATHER BOOTS WITH WHITE KID UPPERS AS I BELIEVE THE TECHNICAL TERM IS ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT HE IS STILL WEARING THE SATIN TIE THE WAISTCOAT AND THE RING
LET US AS YOU SAY SCUD FORTH WE WILL GO TO A MECCA WHY SO CALLED I DO NOT KNOW NOR INDEED DO I EVER HOPE TO KNOW THERE WE MAY OBTAIN AT A PRICE A PASSABLE CUP OF COFFEE AND YOU SHALL TELL ME YOUR PAINFUL STORY
OR RATHER BEING APPARENTLY CERTAIN TO END SATISFACTORILY FOR THE INVALID THOUGH OUT OF DANGER WAS STILL IN BED
THE THING MUST STOP YOUR SECRETARIAL DUTIES MUST BE PARAMOUNT NOTHING MUST BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH THEM YES THE THING MUST STOP BEFORE IT GOES TOO FAR IT SEEMS TO ME SAID MIKE THAT IT HAS GONE TOO FAR I'VE GOT THE SACK
HE'S GOT THE HUMP ABOUT SOMETHING HE'S SITTING THERE LOOKING ABSOLUTELY FED UP WITH THINGS I HOPE THERE'S NOTHING UP HE'S NOT A BAD SORT IT WOULD BE ROT IF ANYTHING ROTTEN'S HAPPENED PSMITH BEGAN TO DISPLAY A GENTLE INTEREST
AND WENT IN THE MANAGER WAS IN HIS CHAIR AT THE BIG TABLE OPPOSITE HIM
ON BOARD MUCH CHEER HIM UNTIL AFTER A CONVERSATION WHICH THEY HAD ONE DAY
USED TO MAKE CRUEL FUN WHENEVER HE SHOWED HIS DUSKY COUNTENANCE IN THE STREET WAS SENT BACK TO CALCUTTA IN THE LADY KICKLEBURY EAST INDIAMAN
I HAVE TO BEG YOUR PARDON FOR SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT SAID HE ABOUT ABOUT THAT LITTLE SQUARE PIANO I NEVER THANKED YOU FOR IT WHEN YOU GAVE IT ME MANY MANY YEARS AGO BEFORE I WAS MARRIED I THOUGHT SOMEBODY ELSE HAD GIVEN IT
AND IN LONDON WHERE SHE WAS MUCH ADMIRED BY PEOPLE OF VERY GREAT FASHION AND HE THEN HINTED HOW BECOMING IT WOULD BE FOR JOS TO SEND GEORGY TO A GOOD SCHOOL AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM FOR HIS MOTHER AND HER PARENTS WOULD BE SURE TO SPOIL HIM
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE FEELING NOW YOU ARE HURT IN YOUR HEART AT THE DISCOVERY ABOUT THE PIANO AND THAT IT CAME FROM ME AND NOT FROM GEORGE I FORGOT OR I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN OF IT SO IT IS FOR ME TO ASK YOUR PARDON FOR BEING A FOOL FOR A MOMENT
BANDBOXES OF THE EMIGRANTS FROM THAT VILLAGE AND WITH THEM THE OLD PIANO AMELIA WOULD HAVE IT UP IN HER SITTING ROOM A NEAT LITTLE APARTMENT ON THE SECOND FLOOR ADJOINING HER FATHER'S CHAMBER AND WHERE THE OLD GENTLEMAN SAT COMMONLY OF EVENINGS
OR YOU AND I HOWEVER OLD SCOLDING AND BANKRUPT MAY WE HAVE IN OUR LAST DAYS A KIND SOFT SHOULDER ON WHICH TO LEAN AND A GENTLE HAND TO SOOTHE OUR GOUTY OLD PILLOWS
SHE DID NOT RESPECT HERSELF ANY MORE THAN THE WORLD RESPECTED HER BUT I BELIEVE THOUGHT IN HER HEART THAT SHE WAS A POOR SPIRITED DESPICABLE LITTLE CREATURE WHOSE LUCK IN LIFE WAS ONLY TOO GOOD FOR HER MERITS O YOU POOR WOMEN
PERHAPS HE WAS NOT INCLINED TO PUT HIMSELF IN HIS EXHAUSTED STATE AGAIN UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF GLORVINA I THINK MISS O'DOWD WOULD HAVE DONE FOR ME HE SAID LAUGHINGLY TO A FELLOW PASSENGER
HAVING PARTAKEN OF A COPIOUS BREAKFAST WITH FISH AND RICE AND HARD EGGS AT SOUTHAMPTON HE HAD SO FAR RALLIED AT WINCHESTER AS TO THINK
AND WE WENT TO VAUXHALL SINCE THEN I HAVE THOUGHT OF BUT ONE WOMAN IN THE WORLD AND THAT WAS YOU I THINK THERE IS NO HOUR IN THE DAY HAS PASSED FOR TWELVE YEARS THAT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF YOU I CAME TO TELL YOU THIS BEFORE I WENT TO INDIA
WHO HAD MOST INJURED AND INSULTED HIM THE SUCCESSFUL MAN OF THE WORLD CURSED THE OLD PAUPER AND RELIEVED HIM FROM TIME TO TIME AS HE FURNISHED GEORGE WITH MONEY FOR HIS MOTHER HE GAVE THE BOY TO UNDERSTAND BY HINTS DELIVERED IN HIS BRUTAL COARSE WAY
I DON'T CARE ABOUT OWNING IT WATERLOO SEDLEY WOULD SAY TO HIS FRIENDS I AM A DRESSY MAN AND THOUGH RATHER UNEASY IF THE LADIES LOOKED AT HIM AT THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE BALLS AND THOUGH HE BLUSHED AND TURNED AWAY ALARMED UNDER THEIR GLANCES
WAS TREMBLING ON HIS LIPS WHEN EMMY REPLIED CAN I DO OTHERWISE DID NOT HE GIVE IT ME I DID NOT KNOW SAID POOR OLD DOB AND HIS COUNTENANCE FELL
BETTER DAYS AS FAR AS WORLDLY PROSPERITY WENT WERE IN STORE FOR BOTH PERHAPS THE INGENIOUS READER HAS GUESSED WHO WAS THE STOUT GENTLEMAN WHO CALLED UPON GEORGY AT HIS SCHOOL IN COMPANY WITH OUR OLD FRIEND MAJOR DOBBIN
THE MAJOR'S VISIT LEFT OLD JOHN SEDLEY IN A GREAT STATE OF AGITATION AND EXCITEMENT HIS DAUGHTER COULD NOT INDUCE HIM TO SETTLE DOWN TO HIS CUSTOMARY OCCUPATIONS OR AMUSEMENTS THAT NIGHT
AND RENDERED HIMSELF SO GAY
MAJOR DOBBIN WAS EXCEEDINGLY PLEASED WHEN AS HE WAS SUPERINTENDING THE ARRANGEMENTS OF JOS'S NEW HOUSE WHICH THE MAJOR INSISTED SHOULD BE VERY HANDSOME AND COMFORTABLE THE CART ARRIVED FROM BROMPTON BRINGING THE TRUNKS AND
OR A SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE UNDER THE CASTLE DUG BY TRENCK WITH HIS NAILS AND A TOOTHPICK THE HISTORIAN HAS NO SUCH ENLIVENING INCIDENT TO RELATE IN THE NARRATIVE OF AMELIA'S CAPTIVITY FANCY HER IF YOU PLEASE DURING THIS PERIOD VERY SAD
WHAT SAD UNSATISFACTORY THOUGHTS THOSE OF THE WIDOW WERE THE CHILDREN RUNNING UP AND DOWN THE SLOPES AND BROAD PATHS IN THE GARDENS REMINDED HER OF GEORGE WHO WAS TAKEN FROM HER THE FIRST GEORGE WAS TAKEN FROM HER
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BUSINESS MY DEAR ANSWERED THE SIRE SHAKING HIS HEAD WITH AN IMPORTANT AIR AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT ON THIS POINT EMMY WAS VERY IGNORANT
AND I'M SURE HE'S GROWN GREY ATHINKING OF YOU BUT AMELIA LOOKING UP AT HER BED OVER WHICH HUNG THE PORTRAITS OF HER HUSBAND AND SON TOLD HER YOUNG PROTEGEE NEVER NEVER TO SPEAK ON THAT SUBJECT AGAIN
BUT IT WAS OF COURSE ARRANGED THAT MARY WAS TO COME AND STAY OFTEN AT THE GRAND NEW HOUSE WHITHER MISSUS OSBORNE WAS GOING AND WHERE MARY WAS SURE SHE WOULD NEVER BE SO HAPPY AS SHE HAD BEEN IN THEIR HUMBLE COT AS MISS CLAPP CALLED IT
THERE WAS NO NEED OF THIS CAUTION FOR THE ELDER SEDLEY HIMSELF BEGAN IMMEDIATELY TO SPEAK OF THE EVENT AND PRATTLED ABOUT IT AND WEPT OVER IT PLENTEOUSLY IT SHOCKED THE INDIAN NOT A LITTLE AND MADE HIM THINK OF HIMSELF LESS THAN THE POOR FELLOW WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO
OLD SEDLEY GREW VERY FOND OF HIS DAUGHTER AFTER HIS WIFE'S DEATH AND AMELIA HAD HER CONSOLATION IN DOING HER DUTY BY THE OLD MAN BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THESE TWO PEOPLE LONG IN SUCH A LOW AND UNGENTEEL STATION OF LIFE
BUT WHICH SHE LOVED FOR REASONS OF HER OWN SHE WAS A CHILD WHEN FIRST SHE PLAYED ON IT AND HER PARENTS GAVE IT HER IT HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HER AGAIN SINCE AS THE READER MAY REMEMBER WHEN HER FATHER'S HOUSE WAS GONE TO RUIN AND THE INSTRUMENT WAS RECOVERED OUT OF THE WRECK
SHE NEVER LIKED TO COME BACK TO THE HOUSE AFTER SHE HAD LEFT IT OR TO FACE THE LANDLADY WHO HAD TYRANNIZED OVER HER WHEN ILL HUMOURED AND UNPAID OR WHEN PLEASED HAD TREATED HER WITH A COARSE FAMILIARITY SCARCELY LESS ODIOUS
IN THESE CONVERSATIONS IT WAS WONDERFUL WITH WHAT PERSEVERANCE AND INGENUITY MAJOR DOBBIN WOULD MANAGE TO BRING THE TALK ROUND TO THE SUBJECT OF AMELIA AND HER LITTLE BOY
INTO HIS BEST SHIRT FRILL IN WHICH IN HIS SUNDAY SUIT OF MOURNING HE SAT FROM SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF HIS SON HOWEVER WHEN THE POSTMAN MADE HIS APPEARANCE THE LITTLE PARTY WERE PUT OUT OF SUSPENSE
TO WHOM ONE OF OUR PARTY GAVE A HALFPENNY WORTH OF SNUFF IN A CORNET OR SCREW OF PAPER THE KINDNESS WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE POOR EPILEPTIC CREATURE HE CRIED IN AN ANGUISH OF DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE
HE SAID THEN HE THOUGHT HE WAS DOOMED HE HAD LEFT A LITTLE SOMETHING TO HIS GODSON IN HIS WILL
THE VERY DAY THAT HE CHANGED THE DRAUGHT MAJOR DOBBIN BEGAN TO MEND
THANK YOU WILLIAM SHE HELD OUT HER HAND BUT THE POOR LITTLE WOMAN'S HEART WAS BLEEDING AND AS FOR HER EYES OF COURSE THEY WERE AT THEIR WORK BUT WILLIAM COULD HOLD NO MORE AMELIA AMELIA HE SAID I DID BUY IT FOR YOU
WE COULD NOT BE SO AFFECTED AND SO IF YOU PROPERLY TYRANNIZE OVER A WOMAN
LISTENED TO HIS STORIES WITH UNTIRING SMILES AND AFFECTIONATE HYPOCRISY OR SAT MUSING BY HIS SIDE AND COMMUNING WITH HER OWN THOUGHTS AND REMINISCENCES AS THE OLD MAN FEEBLE AND QUERULOUS SUNNED HIMSELF ON THE GARDEN BENCHES AND PRATTLED ABOUT HIS WRONGS OR HIS SORROWS
AND MAKE HIM TELL PRODIGIOUS STORIES ABOUT HIMSELF AND HIS EXPLOITS AGAINST TIGERS AND NAPOLEON HE WAS GREAT WHEN HE VISITED THE EMPEROR'S TOMB AT LONGWOOD WHEN TO THESE GENTLEMEN AND THE YOUNG OFFICERS OF THE SHIP MAJOR DOBBIN NOT BEING BY
SHE FINGERED MISSUS OSBORNE'S DRESSES AND CALCULATED THEIR PRICE NOTHING COULD BE TOO GOOD FOR THAT SWEET LADY SHE VOWED AND PROTESTED
AFTER THE DEATH OF GEORGE OSBORNE ON THE PLATEAU AT MOUNT SAINT JOHN HE RECOVERED RALLIED RELAPSED AGAIN HAVING UNDERGONE SUCH A PROCESS OF BLOOD LETTING AND CALOMEL AS SHOWED THE STRENGTH OF HIS ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION
AND THE REFRESHMENT OF BRANDY PAWNEE WHICH HE WAS FORCED TO TAKE THERE
O YOU POOR SECRET MARTYRS AND VICTIMS WHOSE LIFE IS A TORTURE WHO ARE STRETCHED ON RACKS IN YOUR BEDROOMS AND WHO LAY YOUR HEADS DOWN ON THE BLOCK DAILY AT THE DRAWING ROOM TABLE
OF STEWED EELS VEAL CUTLETS AND FRENCH BEANS WITH A BOTTLE OF CLARET HE WAS COLD OVER BAGSHOT HEATH WHERE THE NATIVE CHATTERED MORE AND MORE
HER SERVILITY AND FULSOME COMPLIMENTS WHEN EMMY WAS IN PROSPERITY WERE NOT MORE TO THAT LADY'S LIKING SHE CAST ABOUT NOTES OF ADMIRATION ALL OVER THE NEW HOUSE EXTOLLING EVERY ARTICLE OF FURNITURE OR ORNAMENT
WHY MIRANDA WAS EVEN VERY KIND TO CALIBAN AND WE MAY BE PRETTY SURE FOR THE SAME REASON NOT THAT SHE WOULD ENCOURAGE HIM IN THE LEAST THE POOR UNCOUTH MONSTER OF COURSE NOT NO MORE WOULD EMMY BY ANY MEANS ENCOURAGE HER ADMIRER THE MAJOR
THAT HE HAD BEEN TO SEE MISSUS GEORGE OSBORNE
THE PATENT SAW MILLS AND SAWDUST CONSOLIDATION PROJECT
IT WAS A MATTER OF GREAT DELIGHT AND OCCUPATION TO JOS TO SUPERINTEND THE BUILDING OF A SMART CHARIOT WHICH HE AND THE MAJOR ORDERED IN THE NEIGHBOURING LONG ACRE AND A PAIR OF HANDSOME HORSES WERE JOBBED WITH WHICH JOS DROVE ABOUT IN STATE IN THE PARK
HIS CHESTS OF MANGOES CHUTNEY AND CURRY POWDERS HIS SHAWLS FOR PRESENTS TO PEOPLE WHOM HE DIDN'T KNOW AS YET AND THE REST OF HIS PERSICOS APPARATUS AT LENGTH HE DROVE LEISURELY TO LONDON ON THE THIRD DAY AND IN THE NEW WAISTCOAT
ONLY TAKING AWAY HER PICTURES THE TWO PICTURES OVER THE BED AND HER PIANO
OR TO CALL UPON HIS INDIAN FRIENDS AMELIA WAS NOT SELDOM BY HIS SIDE ON THESE EXCURSIONS WHEN ALSO MAJOR DOBBIN WOULD BE SEEN IN THE BACK SEAT OF THE CARRIAGE AT OTHER TIMES OLD SEDLEY AND HIS DAUGHTER TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT
WHO TOLD YOU THOSE LIES OH M'AM POLLY SAID
WHO STRIVE FAST WATCH AND SUFFER UNPITIED AND FADE AWAY IGNOBLY AND UNKNOWN THE HIDDEN AND AWFUL WISDOM WHICH APPORTIONS THE DESTINIES OF MANKIND
THEY WERE TWO MONTHS LATER THAN THE MAJOR'S AND THE SHIP'S SURGEON CONGRATULATED HIMSELF UPON THE TREATMENT ADOPTED BY HIM TOWARDS HIS NEW PATIENT WHO HAD BEEN CONSIGNED TO SHIPBOARD BY THE MADRAS PRACTITIONER WITH VERY SMALL HOPES INDEED FOR FROM THAT DAY
EXPRESSED TO HIM BUT HAD FELT FOR HIS PIANO A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS AS THEY WERE SEATED IN THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE JOS HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WITH GREAT COMFORT AFTER DINNER AMELIA SAID WITH RATHER A FALTERING VOICE TO MAJOR DOBBIN
HE PASSED IN THE PREPARATION OF THESE DOCUMENTS TREMBLING ABOUT FROM ONE ROOM TO ANOTHER WITH A QUIVERING CANDLE AND SHAKY HANDS HERE'S THE WINE PAPERS HERE'S THE SAWDUST HERE'S THE COALS HERE'S MY LETTERS TO CALCUTTA AND MADRAS
WHERE THE TROOPS SHOULD FIRE A SALVO OVER HIS GRAVE AND WHERE MANY A GALLANT OFFICER LIES FAR AWAY FROM HIS HOME HERE AS THE POOR FELLOW LAY TOSSING IN HIS FEVER THE PEOPLE WHO WATCHED HIM MIGHT HAVE HEARD HIM RAVING ABOUT AMELIA
FOR IT MUST BE PREMISED THAT WHILE THE MAJOR WAS LYING ILL AT MADRAS HAVING MADE SUCH PRODIGIOUS HASTE TO GO THITHER
WHEN ON THEIR PASSAGE OUT TO THE CAPE WHERE THE REVEREND GENTLEMAN WAS A MISSIONARY BUT FOR COMMON READING HE HAD BROUGHT A STOCK OF NOVELS AND PLAYS WHICH HE LENT TO THE REST OF THE SHIP AND RENDERED HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO ALL BY HIS KINDNESS AND CONDESCENSION
I AM HIS NOW AS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME DEAR WILLIAM IT WAS HE WHO TOLD ME HOW GOOD AND GENEROUS YOU WERE AND WHO TAUGHT ME TO LOVE YOU AS A BROTHER HAVE YOU NOT BEEN EVERYTHING TO ME AND MY BOY OUR DEAREST TRUEST KINDEST FRIEND AND PROTECTOR
WHITHER THE AFFECTIONATE FELLOW DROVE FIRST AND BEFORE HIEING TO THE APARTMENTS SECURED FOR HIM BY MISTER DOBBIN AT THE SLAUGHTERS ALL THE FACES IN THE STREET WERE IN THE WINDOWS THE LITTLE MAIDSERVANT FLEW TO THE WICKET GATE
AND THINKING THAT YEARS OF CONSTANCY AND DEVOTION MIGHT HAVE PLEADED WITH YOU IT IS YOU WHO ARE CRUEL NOW AMELIA SAID WITH SOME SPIRIT GEORGE IS MY HUSBAND HERE AND IN HEAVEN HOW COULD I LOVE ANY OTHER BUT HIM
HER SOME SUCH BOONS AS THESE WERE THE BEST WHICH FORTUNE ALLOTTED TO POOR LITTLE AMELIA HER LIFE BEGUN NOT UNPROSPEROUSLY HAD COME DOWN TO THIS
SHUDDERING IN A SHAWL ON THE BOX
DOBBIN BECAME SO IMPATIENT AND ILL HUMOURED AS TO SURPRISE THOSE COMRADES WHO HAD BEFORE ADMIRED HIS VIVACITY AND GOOD TEMPER HE DID NOT RECOVER UNTIL THE BREEZE SPRANG UP AGAIN AND WAS IN A HIGHLY EXCITED STATE WHEN THE PILOT CAME ON BOARD
LITTLE POLLY WAS TOO YOUNG MISSUS OSBORNE COULD NOT FIND ANYBODY TO SUIT THE MAJOR BEFORE SHE WENT TO SLEEP THE SAME MORNING
THE CIVILIAN WAS THEREFORE AN EASY VICTIM TO THE GUILELESS ARTS OF THIS GOOD NATURED DIPLOMATIST AND WAS READY TO DO TO PURCHASE HIRE OR RELINQUISH WHATEVER HIS FRIEND THOUGHT FIT LOLL JEWAB
LONG BROODING OVER THOSE LOST PLEASURES EXAGGERATES THEIR CHARM AND SWEETNESS JOS WAS UNAFFECTEDLY GLAD TO SEE AND SHAKE THE HAND OF HIS FATHER BETWEEN WHOM AND HIMSELF THERE HAD BEEN A COOLNESS GLAD TO SEE HIS LITTLE SISTER
AMELIA FOUND HIM UP VERY EARLY THE NEXT MORNING MORE EAGER MORE HECTIC AND MORE SHAKY THAN EVER I DIDN'T SLEEP MUCH EMMY MY DEAR HE SAID I WAS THINKING OF MY POOR BESSY I WISH SHE WAS ALIVE TO RIDE IN JOS'S CARRIAGE ONCE AGAIN
FROM CHILDHOOD UPWARDS SHE HAD BEEN WITH HER DAILY AND HAD ATTACHED HERSELF SO PASSIONATELY TO THAT DEAR GOOD LADY THAT WHEN THE GRAND BAROUCHE CAME TO CARRY HER OFF INTO SPLENDOUR SHE FAINTED IN THE ARMS OF HER FRIEND
AND LEAVING THE LITTLE PROPERTY OF WHICH HE WAS POSSESSED TO THOSE WHOM HE MOST DESIRED TO BENEFIT THE FRIEND IN WHOSE HOUSE HE WAS LOCATED WITNESSED HIS TESTAMENT HE DESIRED TO BE BURIED WITH A LITTLE
HE DESCRIBED THE WHOLE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AND ALL BUT ANNOUNCED THAT NAPOLEON NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE TO SAINT HELENA AT ALL BUT FOR HIM JOS SEDLEY AFTER LEAVING SAINT HELENA HE BECAME VERY GENEROUS DISPOSING OF A GREAT QUANTITY OF SHIP STORES CLARET
HER LITTLE BOY SAT BY HER SIDE IN POMPOUS NEW SABLES SHE REMEMBERED THE OLD PEW WOMAN AND CLERK HER THOUGHTS WERE AWAY IN OTHER TIMES AS THE PARSON READ BUT THAT SHE HELD GEORGE'S HAND IN HER OWN PERHAPS SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO CHANGE PLACES WITH
ON THE CONTRARY WITH SOMETHING AKIN TO GRATITUDE AMELIA TOOK THE CRUMBS THAT HER FATHER IN LAW LET DROP NOW AND THEN AND WITH THEM FED HER OWN PARENT DIRECTLY SHE UNDERSTOOD IT TO BE HER DUTY IT WAS THIS YOUNG WOMAN'S NATURE
IT WAS CHIEFLY FROM A DREAD LEST THEY SHOULD MAKE LOVE TO HIM THAT HE AVOIDED THEM BEING AVERSE TO MARRIAGE ALTOGETHER BUT THERE WAS NO SUCH SWELL IN CALCUTTA AS WATERLOO SEDLEY I HAVE HEARD SAY AND HE HAD THE HANDSOMEST TURN OUT GAVE THE BEST BACHELOR DINNERS
OR A MOUSE TO COME OUT AND PLAY ABOUT LATUDE'S
HE DISAPPEARED RATHER IN A PANIC DURING A TWO DAYS GALE IN WHICH HE HAD THE PORTHOLES OF HIS CABIN BATTENED DOWN AND REMAINED IN HIS COT READING THE WASHERWOMAN OF FINCHLEY COMMON LEFT ON BOARD THE RAMCHUNDER BY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LADY EMILY HORNBLOWER
SHE KEPT HER OWN AND BECAME IT VERY WELL AND HIS EYES FILLED WITH TEARS WHICH TRICKLED DOWN HIS FURROWED OLD FACE AMELIA WIPED THEM AWAY AND SMILINGLY KISSED HIM AND TIED THE OLD MAN'S NECKCLOTH IN A SMART BOW AND PUT HIS BROOCH
IT NEVER ENTERED INTO HIS HEAD TO SUPPOSE THAT EMMY SHOULD THINK ANYBODY ELSE WAS THE PURCHASER AND AS A MATTER OF COURSE HE FANCIED THAT SHE KNEW THE GIFT CAME FROM HIM DO YOU AMELIA HE SAID AND THE QUESTION THE GREAT QUESTION OF ALL
WAS SOOTHED DOWN BY THE MAJOR WHO POINTED OUT THE ELDER'S ILL FORTUNES AND OLD AGE HE WOULD NOT PERHAPS LIKE TO LIVE WITH THE OLD COUPLE WHOSE WAYS AND HOURS MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH THOSE OF A YOUNGER MAN
THE OLD MAN WAS VERY MUCH AFFECTED SO OF COURSE WAS HIS DAUGHTER NOR WAS JOS WITHOUT FEELING IN THAT LONG ABSENCE OF TEN YEARS THE MOST SELFISH WILL THINK ABOUT HOME AND EARLY TIES DISTANCE SANCTIFIES BOTH
WHEN MISTER BINNY PASSED WITH HIS BRIDE AND THE MAJOR LEARNED THAT HE HAD NO LONGER A RIVAL TO FEAR
THAT EVEN CAPTAIN BRAGG WHO THOUGHT THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS PASSENGER AND CONSIDERED HE WAS A POOR SPIRITED FELLER AT FIRST
A DISPOSITION NATURALLY SIMPLE AND DEMANDING PROTECTION A LONG COURSE OF POVERTY AND HUMILITY OF DAILY PRIVATIONS AND HARD WORDS OF KIND OFFICES AND NO RETURNS HAD BEEN HER LOT EVER SINCE WOMANHOOD ALMOST
THE DOCTOR WAS OFF TO HIS FAMILY AT PORTSEA BRAGG
HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE THERE WOMEN FOR THE MOST PART WHO ARE DOOMED TO ENDURE THIS LONG SLAVERY WHO ARE HOSPITAL NURSES WITHOUT WAGES SISTERS OF CHARITY IF YOU LIKE
CRIED HOORAY AND MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT HE MUST BE A GOVERNOR GENERAL HE I PROMISE DID NOT DECLINE THE OBSEQUIOUS INVITATION OF THE LANDLORDS TO ALIGHT AND REFRESH HIMSELF IN THE NEAT COUNTRY TOWNS
I LOVED YOU THEN AS I DO NOW I MUST TELL YOU I THINK I LOVED YOU FROM THE FIRST MINUTE THAT I SAW YOU WHEN GEORGE BROUGHT ME TO YOUR HOUSE TO SHOW ME THE AMELIA WHOM HE WAS ENGAGED TO YOU WERE BUT A GIRL IN WHITE WITH LARGE RINGLETS YOU CAME DOWN SINGING DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT BUFFETS SCORNS PRIVATIONS POVERTIES HAD SHE ENDURED FOR FATHER AND MOTHER
TO LAY BY A CONSIDERABLE SUM OF MONEY HE WAS FREE TO COME HOME AND STAY WITH A GOOD PENSION OR TO RETURN AND RESUME THAT RANK IN THE SERVICE TO WHICH HIS SENIORITY AND HIS VAST TALENTS ENTITLED HIM
HE DID NOT KNOW AS YET WHAT EVENTS HAD HAPPENED IN THE LITTLE SEDLEY FAMILY AND HOW DEATH HAD REMOVED THE MOTHER AND RICHES HAD CARRIED OFF GEORGE FROM AMELIA
HE COULD ENJOY HIS HOOKAH THERE WITH SUCH PERFECT EASE AND COULD SWAGGER DOWN TO THE THEATRES WHEN MINDED SO AGREEABLY THAT PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE REMAINED ALTOGETHER AT THE SLAUGHTERS HAD NOT HIS FRIEND THE MAJOR BEEN AT HIS ELBOW
AND IN THE EXPANSIVENESS AND OVERFLOWING OF HEART OCCASIONED BY THE FIRST MEETING DECLARED THAT THEY SHOULD NEVER SUFFER WANT OR DISCOMFORT ANY MORE THAT HE WAS AT HOME FOR SOME TIME AT ANY RATE DURING WHICH HIS HOUSE AND EVERYTHING HE HAD SHOULD BE THEIRS
WHO WAS INDEED SCARCELY LESS AFFECTED THAN THE GOOD NATURED GIRL AMELIA LOVED HER LIKE A DAUGHTER DURING ELEVEN YEARS THE GIRL HAD BEEN HER CONSTANT FRIEND AND ASSOCIATE THE SEPARATION WAS A VERY PAINFUL ONE INDEED TO HER
WHOSE VIRTUE IS A DEFICIENCY OF TEMPTATION WHOSE SUCCESS MAY BE A CHANCE WHOSE RANK MAY BE AN ANCESTOR'S ACCIDENT WHOSE PROSPERITY IS VERY LIKELY A SATIRE THEY BURIED AMELIA'S MOTHER IN THE CHURCHYARD AT BROMPTON
SHAKING ALL OVER JOS DESCENDED FROM THE POST CHAISE AND DOWN THE CREAKING SWAYING STEPS IN AWFUL STATE SUPPORTED BY THE NEW VALET FROM SOUTHAMPTON AND THE SHUDDERING NATIVE WHOSE BROWN FACE WAS NOW LIVID WITH COLD
BUT ALWAYS READY TO SMILE WHEN SPOKEN TO IN A VERY MEAN POOR NOT TO SAY VULGAR POSITION OF LIFE SINGING SONGS MAKING PUDDINGS PLAYING CARDS MENDING STOCKINGS FOR HER OLD FATHER'S BENEFIT SO NEVER MIND WHETHER SHE BE A HEROINE OR NO
AMELIA AS SHE READ OUT THE LETTER TO HER FATHER PAUSED OVER THE LATTER WORD HER BROTHER IT WAS CLEAR DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE FAMILY NOR COULD HE FOR THE FACT IS
I WAS AFRAID YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT IT I VALUE IT MORE THAN ANYTHING I HAVE IN THE WORLD SAID AMELIA DO YOU AMELIA CRIED THE MAJOR THE FACT WAS AS HE HAD BOUGHT IT HIMSELF THOUGH HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT
IN FACT WHEN HE DROVE INTO TOWN HE WAS AS FULL OF WINE BEER MEAT PICKLES CHERRY BRANDY AND TOBACCO AS THE STEWARD'S CABIN OF A STEAM PACKET IT WAS EVENING WHEN HIS CARRIAGE THUNDERED UP TO THE LITTLE DOOR IN BROMPTON
AND AT A TIME WHEN HIS PRESENCE WAS LIKELY TO BE OF GREAT COMFORT TO HIS RELATIVES THERE MAJOR DOBBIN HAVING EASILY SUCCEEDED IN GETTING LEAVE FROM HIS GOOD NATURED COMMANDANT TO PROCEED TO MADRAS
IT WAS I SAY HER NATURE TO SACRIFICE HERSELF AND TO FLING ALL THAT SHE HAD AT THE FEET OF THE BELOVED OBJECT DURING WHAT LONG THANKLESS NIGHTS HAD SHE WORKED OUT HER FINGERS FOR LITTLE GEORGY WHILST AT HOME WITH HER
AND HOLDING ON TO LITTLE BOYS WITH THE EXCEEDING LARGE EYES AND CURLY HAIR OGLE LADIES IN RIDING HABITS PRANCING BY THE STATUE OF ACHILLES AT APSLEY HOUSE JOS ALTHOUGH PROVIDED WITH SOME OF THE MOST SPLENDID VESTS THAT CALCUTTA COULD FURNISH
WHICH FAILED FROM A MOST UNACCOUNTABLE ACCIDENT AFTER COMMENCING WITH THE MOST SPLENDID PROSPECTS THE COAL PROJECT WHICH ONLY A WANT OF CAPITAL PREVENTED FROM BECOMING THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SCHEME EVER PUT BEFORE THE PUBLIC
HE WAS RATHER THINNER THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HIM BUT HAD GAINED IN MAJESTY AND SOLEMNITY OF DEMEANOUR HE HAD RESUMED THE MUSTACHIOS TO WHICH HIS SERVICES AT WATERLOO ENTITLED HIM
PITY SOME PEOPLE ARE SO KNOWING ALL THESE TWOPENNY DOCUMENTS ARRANGED ON A SIDE TABLE OLD SEDLEY COVERED THEM CAREFULLY OVER WITH A CLEAN BANDANNA HANDKERCHIEF ONE OUT OF MAJOR DOBBIN'S LOT
HOW ELEGANT HOW GENTLE SHE WAS AND OF WHAT REFINED GOOD MANNERS
THE MAJOR FOLDED HIS ARMS ROUND HER HOLDING HER TO HIM AS IF SHE WAS A CHILD AND KISSED HER HEAD I WILL NOT CHANGE DEAR AMELIA HE SAID I ASK FOR NO MORE THAN YOUR LOVE
THAT MAJOR DOBBIN HAD BEEN HER HUSBAND'S DEAREST FRIEND AND HER OWN AND GEORGE'S MOST KIND AND AFFECTIONATE GUARDIAN THAT SHE LOVED HIM AS A BROTHER BUT THAT A WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN MARRIED TO SUCH AN ANGEL AS THAT AND SHE POINTED TO THE WALL COULD NEVER THINK OF ANY OTHER UNION
IS PLEASED SO TO HUMILIATE AND CAST DOWN THE TENDER GOOD AND WISE AND TO SET UP THE SELFISH THE FOOLISH OR THE WICKED OH BE HUMBLE MY BROTHER IN YOUR PROSPERITY BE GENTLE WITH THOSE WHO ARE LESS LUCKY IF NOT MORE DESERVING THINK WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO BE SCORNFUL
THOUGH I WISHED AND PRAYED FOR YOU TO COME AND THEY TOOK HIM TOO AWAY FROM ME ISN'T HE A NOBLE BOY WILLIAM BE HIS FRIEND STILL AND MINE AND HERE HER VOICE BROKE AND SHE HID HER FACE ON HIS SHOULDER
THAT GEORGE'S MATERNAL GRANDFATHER WAS BUT A WRETCHED OLD BANKRUPT AND DEPENDANT AND THAT JOHN SEDLEY MIGHT THANK THE MAN TO WHOM HE ALREADY OWED EVER SO MUCH MONEY
THE NEXT TIME THAT OLD SEDLEY ASKED HER TO PLAY SHE SAID IT WAS SHOCKINGLY OUT OF TUNE THAT SHE HAD A HEADACHE THAT SHE COULDN'T PLAY THEN ACCORDING TO HER CUSTOM SHE REBUKED HERSELF
IT WAS ONE OF THE MANY CAUSES FOR PERSONAL PRIDE WITH WHICH OLD OSBORNE CHOSE TO RECREATE HIMSELF THAT SEDLEY HIS ANCIENT RIVAL ENEMY AND BENEFACTOR
EVEN WHEN MISSUS CLAPP LOST HER OWN TEMPER AND PRESSED FOR THE RENT WHEN THE KIND CREATURE WAS GOING AWAY FOR GOOD AND ALL THE LANDLADY REPROACHED HERSELF BITTERLY FOR EVER HAVING USED A ROUGH EXPRESSION TO HER HOW SHE WEPT
AND HIS WHOLE HEART WAS BENT UPON DOING HER GOOD HE COAXED WHEEDLED CAJOLED AND COMPLIMENTED JOS SEDLEY WITH A PERSEVERANCE AND CORDIALITY OF WHICH HE WAS NOT AWARE HIMSELF VERY LIKELY BUT SOME MEN WHO HAVE UNMARRIED SISTERS OR DAUGHTERS EVEN
TO WHOM SHE HAD BEEN FORCED TO PUT UP PETITIONS FOR TIME WHEN THE RENT WAS OVERDUE
THOUGHT HE COULD NOT GO TO TOWN UNTIL HE WAS SUPPLIED WITH ONE OR TWO OF THESE GARMENTS AND SELECTED A CRIMSON SATIN EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD BUTTERFLIES AND A BLACK AND RED VELVET TARTAN WITH WHITE STRIPES AND A ROLLING COLLAR
SHE SLEPT THEREFORE VERY SOUNDLY THAT EVENING AFTER THE CONVERSATION WITH MISS POLLY AND WAS MORE THAN ORDINARILY HAPPY IN SPITE OF JOS'S DELAYING
A VOYAGE TO EUROPE WAS PRONOUNCED NECESSARY FOR HIM AND HAVING SERVED HIS FULL TIME IN INDIA
THE VERY THOUGHT OF THEM IS ODIOUS AND LOW THERE MUST BE CLASSES THERE MUST BE RICH AND POOR DIVES SAYS SMACKING HIS CLARET
HIS SERVANTS WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM BROUGHT HIM TO THE HOUSE OF THE FRIEND WITH WHOM HE HAD RESOLVED TO STAY UNTIL HIS DEPARTURE FOR EUROPE IN A STATE OF DELIRIUM AND IT WAS THOUGHT FOR MANY MANY DAYS THAT HE WOULD NEVER TRAVEL FARTHER THAN THE BURYING GROUND OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT GEORGE'S
HE AIN'T GOT MANNERS BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HIM AND THUS CAPTAIN BRAGG SHOWED THAT HE POSSESSED DISCRIMINATION AS A MAN AS WELL AS ABILITY AS A COMMANDER BUT A CALM TAKING PLACE WHEN THE RAMCHUNDER WAS WITHIN TEN DAYS SAIL OF ENGLAND
OUR FRIEND BEGAN TO AMEND AND HE WAS QUITE WELL THOUGH AS GAUNT AS A GREYHOUND BEFORE THEY REACHED THE CAPE KIRK WILL BE DISAPPOINTED OF HIS MAJORITY THIS TIME HE SAID WITH A SMILE HE WILL EXPECT TO FIND HIMSELF GAZETTED BY THE TIME THE REGIMENT REACHES HOME
COLONEL O'DOWD NEVER COULD HAVE A SISTER FIT FOR SUCH AN ACCOMPLISHED MAN AS MAJOR WILLIAM WHO WAS THERE AMONGST HER LITTLE CIRCLE WHO WOULD MAKE HIM A GOOD WIFE NOT MISS BINNY SHE WAS TOO OLD AND ILL TEMPERED MISS OSBORNE TOO OLD TOO
I RECOLLECT SEEING YEARS AGO AT THE PRISONS FOR IDIOTS AND MADMEN AT BICETRE NEAR PARIS A POOR WRETCH BENT DOWN UNDER THE BONDAGE OF HIS IMPRISONMENT AND HIS PERSONAL INFIRMITY
WITH PARENTS AND WITH THE SWEET MATCHLESS CHILDREN I SAW SAID THE SHADOW WHAT NO HUMAN BEING MUST KNOW BUT WHAT THEY WOULD ALL SO WILLINGLY KNOW WHAT IS BAD IN THEIR NEIGHBOR
AND THOU WILT GO TO PRISON AND THAT HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO FOR THE SENTINELS OBEYED HIM WHOM THEY KNEW THE KING'S DAUGHTER WAS TO MARRY YOU TREMBLE SAID THE PRINCESS AS THE SHADOW CAME INTO HER CHAMBER
THE LIGHT BURNT IN THE ROOM BEHIND HIM AND THUS IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT HIS SHADOW SHOULD FALL ON HIS OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S WALL YES THERE IT SAT DIRECTLY OPPOSITE BETWEEN THE FLOWERS ON THE BALCONY
FOR HE FOUND EVERYTHING MARVELLOUS OUT THERE IN THE WARM LANDS IF THERE HAD ONLY BEEN NO SUN THE STRANGER'S LANDLORD SAID THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO HAD TAKEN THE HOUSE OPPOSITE ONE SAW NO PERSON ABOUT
AND HE THOUGHT THAT A STRANGE LUSTRE CAME FROM THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE ALL THE FLOWERS SHONE LIKE FLAMES IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND IN THE MIDST OF THE FLOWERS STOOD A SLENDER GRACEFUL MAIDEN
FOR YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS LOVE OUR NATIVE LAND I KNOW YOU HAVE GOT ANOTHER SHADOW AGAIN HAVE I ANYTHING TO PAY TO IT OR YOU IF SO YOU WILL OBLIGE ME BY SAYING WHAT IT IS
IT WAS FIRST TOWARDS EVENING WHEN THE SUN WAS DOWN THAT THEY BEGAN TO FRESHEN UP AGAIN IN THE WARM LANDS EVERY WINDOW HAS A BALCONY AND THE PEOPLE CAME OUT ON ALL THE BALCONIES IN THE STREET
ASKED THE LEARNED MAN YES I THOUGHT AS MUCH SAID THE FINE MAN I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NOT KNOW ME I HAVE GOT SO MUCH BODY I HAVE EVEN GOT FLESH AND CLOTHES
BUT BECAUSE HE KNEW THERE WAS A STORY ABOUT A MAN WITHOUT A SHADOW IT WAS KNOWN TO EVERYBODY AT HOME IN THE COLD LANDS AND IF THE LEARNED MAN NOW CAME THERE AND TOLD HIS STORY
IN OUR TIME WATER HAS WONDERFUL POWERS
BUT THEN SHE WAS NOT AT HOME HE HAD PEEPED IN AT THE WINDOW ABOVE AND BELOW HE HAD SEEN BOTH THE ONE AND THE OTHER AND SO HE COULD ANSWER THE PRINCESS AND MAKE INSINUATIONS
THEN THE SHADOW CAME AGAIN HOW GOES IT SAID THE SHADOW ALAS SAID THE LEARNED MAN I WRITE ABOUT THE TRUE AND THE GOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL BUT NO ONE CARES TO HEAR SUCH THINGS I AM QUITE DESPERATE
AND THAT ONE MUST ALWAYS DO AND WHAT DIDST THOU THEN SEE ASKED THE LEARNED MAN I SAW EVERYTHING AND I SHALL TELL ALL TO YOU BUT IT IS NO PRIDE ON MY PART AS A FREE MAN AND WITH THE KNOWLEDGE I HAVE
THIS IS IN FACT A BASE WORLD I WOULD NOT BE A MAN IF IT WERE NOT NOW ONCE ACCEPTED AND REGARDED AS SOMETHING TO BE SO I SAW THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE THINGS WITH THE WOMEN WITH THE MEN
IT WAS AS IF SHE ALSO SHONE THE LIGHT REALLY HURT HIS EYES
SO THAT SHE WAS QUITE ASTONISHED HE MUST BE THE WISEST MAN IN THE WHOLE WORLD SHE FELT SUCH RESPECT FOR WHAT HE KNEW SO THAT WHEN THEY AGAIN DANCED TOGETHER SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM
SAID THE SHADOW AND THEN HE SAT WITH THE POLISHED BOOTS AS HEAVILY AS HE COULD ON THE ARM OF THE LEARNED MAN'S NEW SHADOW WHICH LAY LIKE A POODLE DOG AT HIS FEET NOW THIS WAS PERHAPS FROM ARROGANCE
YES HE WAS QUITE AWAKE WITH ONE SPRING HE WAS ON THE FLOOR HE CREPT GENTLY BEHIND THE CURTAIN BUT THE MAIDEN WAS GONE THE FLOWERS SHONE NO LONGER BUT THERE THEY STOOD FRESH AND BLOOMING AS EVER
I AM EXTREMELY GLAD TO HEAR OF THY GOOD FORTUNE SIT DOWN OLD FRIEND AND TELL ME A LITTLE HOW IT HAS GONE WITH THEE AND WHAT THOU HAST SEEN AT OUR OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S THERE IN THE WARM LANDS
THE DIN OF CARRIAGES DRIVING AND COMPANY ARRIVING YES IT WAS IN TRUTH LIVELY ENOUGH DOWN IN THE STREET
THE SHADOW IT IS IN THE HOT LANDS THAT THE SUN BURNS SURE ENOUGH THERE THE PEOPLE BECOME QUITE A MAHOGANY BROWN AY AND IN THE HOTTEST LANDS THEY ARE BURNT TO NEGROES
NOW THEY WERE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THE PRINCESS REIGNED WHEN SHE WAS AT HOME LISTEN MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE SHADOW TO THE LEARNED MAN I HAVE NOW BECOME AS HAPPY AND MIGHTY AS ANYONE CAN BE
AS WE HAVE NOW BECOME COMPANIONS AND IN THIS WAY HAVE GROWN UP TOGETHER FROM CHILDHOOD SHALL WE NOT DRINK THOU TOGETHER IT IS MORE FAMILIAR YOU ARE RIGHT SAID THE SHADOW WHO WAS NOW THE PROPER MASTER
WAS IT THERE AS IN THE FRESH WOODS WAS IT THERE AS IN A HOLY CHURCH WERE THE SALOONS LIKE THE STARLIT FIRMAMENT WHEN WE STAND ON THE HIGH MOUNTAINS EVERYTHING WAS THERE SAID THE SHADOW
MY BEARD DOES NOT GROW OUT AS IT OUGHT THAT IS ALSO A SICKNESS AND ONE MUST HAVE A BEARD NOW YOU BE WISE AND ACCEPT THE OFFER WE SHALL TRAVEL AS COMRADES AND SO THEY TRAVELLED
I AM IN THE MOST BRILLIANT CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THERE CAME A SORT OF DESIRE OVER ME TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE BEFORE YOU DIE YOU WILL DIE I SUPPOSE I ALSO WISHED TO SEE THIS LAND AGAIN
THOU MUST SUBMIT TO BE CALLED SHADOW BY ALL AND EVERYONE THOU MUST NOT SAY THAT THOU HAST EVER BEEN A MAN AND ONCE A YEAR WHEN I SIT ON THE BALCONY IN THE SUNSHINE
THOU ART ONLY DRESSED UP THERE IS NO ONE WHO WILL BELIEVE IT SAID THE SHADOW BE REASONABLE OR I WILL CALL THE GUARD I WILL GO DIRECTLY TO THE PRINCESS SAID THE LEARNED MAN BUT I WILL GO FIRST SAID THE SHADOW
THEY BELONG TO MY CHILDHOOD'S LEARNING SAID THE SHADOW I REALLY BELIEVE MY SHADOW BY THE DOOR THERE CAN ANSWER THEM YOUR SHADOW SAID THE PRINCESS THAT WOULD INDEED BE MARVELLOUS
BUT NOW IT WAS ONLY TO THE HOT LANDS THAT A LEARNED MAN HAD COME FROM THE COLD THERE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD RUN ABOUT JUST AS WHEN AT HOME BUT HE SOON FOUND OUT HIS MISTAKE HE
FOR HE KNEW THAT THE SHADOW WOULD ALWAYS HAVE ITS MASTER FOR A SCREEN BUT HE COULD NOT ENTICE IT HE MADE HIMSELF LITTLE HE MADE HIMSELF GREAT BUT NO SHADOW CAME AGAIN HE SAID HEM HEM
FOR I TAKE IT SO MUCH TO HEART BUT I DON'T SAID THE SHADOW I BECOME FAT AND IT IS THAT ONE WANTS TO BECOME YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORLD YOU WILL BECOME ILL BY IT YOU MUST TRAVEL
ONE EVENING AS HE WAS SITTING IN HIS ROOM THERE WAS A GENTLE KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
BECOME VERY WELL OFF SHALL I PURCHASE MY FREEDOM FROM SERVICE IF SO I CAN DO IT AND THEN HE RATTLED A WHOLE BUNCH OF VALUABLE SEALS THAT HUNG TO HIS WATCH AND HE STUCK HIS HAND
BUT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL PERMIT ME TO OBSERVE THAT HE IS SO PROUD OF PASSING HIMSELF OFF FOR A MAN THAT WHEN HE IS TO BE IN A PROPER HUMOR AND HE MUST BE SO TO ANSWER WELL HE MUST BE TREATED QUITE LIKE A MAN
AND THEN THEN I WAS IN THE ANTECHAMBER SAID THE SHADOW YOU ALWAYS SAT AND LOOKED OVER TO THE ANTECHAMBER THERE WAS NO LIGHT THERE WAS A SORT OF TWILIGHT
I HAVE NO SHADOW SO THEN IT HAS ACTUALLY GONE LAST NIGHT AND NOT COME AGAIN IT IS REALLY TIRESOME THIS ANNOYED HIM NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THE SHADOW WAS GONE
THAT IT WAS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT THE LEARNED MAN THEN CAME HOME AND HE WROTE BOOKS ABOUT WHAT WAS TRUE IN THE WORLD AND ABOUT WHAT WAS GOOD AND WHAT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND THERE PASSED DAYS AND YEARS
AND ALL SENSIBLE FOLKS WERE OBLIGED TO STAY WITHIN DOORS THE WINDOW SHUTTERS AND DOORS WERE CLOSED THE WHOLE DAY IT LOOKED AS IF THE WHOLE HOUSE SLEPT OR THERE WAS NO ONE AT HOME
YOU CERTAINLY NEVER THOUGHT OF SEEING ME SO WELL OFF DO YOU NOT KNOW YOUR OLD SHADOW YOU CERTAINLY THOUGHT I SHOULD NEVER MORE RETURN THINGS HAVE GONE ON WELL WITH ME SINCE I WAS LAST WITH YOU I HAVE IN ALL RESPECTS
BUT YOU YOURSELF DO NOT BELONG TO THE COMMON ORDER AND I AS YOU KNOW WELL HAVE FROM A CHILD FOLLOWED IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS AS SOON AS YOU FOUND I WAS CAPABLE TO GO OUT ALONE IN THE WORLD I WENT MY OWN WAY
WAS NOT AT ALL IN THE MOST ENVIABLE STATE GRIEF AND TORMENT FOLLOWED HIM AND WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE TRUE AND THE GOOD AND THE BEAUTIFUL WAS TO MOST PERSONS LIKE ROSES FOR A COW HE WAS QUITE ILL AT LAST
AND WHO LIVED THERE WHERE WAS THE ACTUAL ENTRANCE THE WHOLE OF THE GROUND FLOOR WAS A ROW OF SHOPS AND THERE PEOPLE COULD NOT ALWAYS BE RUNNING THROUGH ONE EVENING THE STRANGER SAT OUT ON THE BALCONY
ONLY IN THAT SINGLE HOUSE WHICH STOOD OPPOSITE THAT IN WHICH THE LEARNED FOREIGNER LIVED IT WAS QUITE STILL AND YET SOME ONE LIVED THERE FOR THERE STOOD FLOWERS IN THE BALCONY
NAY IS IT REALLY THOU SAID THE LEARNED MAN IT IS MOST REMARKABLE I NEVER IMAGINED THAT ONE'S OLD SHADOW COULD COME AGAIN AS A MAN TELL ME WHAT I HAVE TO PAY SAID THE SHADOW
WHAT A MAN THAT MUST BE WHO HAS SO WISE A SHADOW THOUGHT SHE IT WILL BE A REAL BLESSING TO MY PEOPLE AND KINGDOM IF I CHOOSE HIM FOR MY CONSORT I WILL DO IT THEY WERE SOON AGREED
WHEN THE SUN ROSE AND WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN I BECAME SO STRANGELY GREAT IN THE MOONLIGHT I WAS VERY NEAR BEING MORE DISTINCT THAN YOURSELF AT THAT TIME I DID NOT UNDERSTAND MY NATURE
IT IS SAID IN A VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD AND WELL MEANT MANNER YOU AS A LEARNED MAN CERTAINLY KNOW HOW STRANGE NATURE IS SOME PERSONS CANNOT BEAR TO TOUCH GREY PAPER OR THEY BECOME ILL
THE STREET BOYS WERE SCREAMING AND HOOTING AND SHOUTING AND SHOOTING WITH DEVILS AND DETONATING BALLS AND THERE CAME CORPSE BEARERS AND HOOD WEARERS FOR THERE WERE FUNERALS WITH PSALM AND HYMN AND THEN
I BECAME A MAN I CAME OUT MATURED BUT YOU WERE NO LONGER IN THE WARM LANDS AS A MAN I WAS ASHAMED TO GO AS I DID I WAS IN WANT OF BOOTS OF CLOTHES
I WILL TAKE YOU WITH ME FOR OLD ACQUAINTANCE SAKE I WILL PAY THE TRAVELLING EXPENSES AND YOU WRITE THE DESCRIPTIONS AND IF THEY ARE A LITTLE AMUSING FOR ME ON THE WAY I WILL GO TO A WATERING PLACE
YOU REALLY LOOK LIKE A SHADOW SAID HIS FRIENDS TO HIM AND THE LEARNED MAN TREMBLED FOR HE THOUGHT OF IT YOU MUST GO TO A WATERING PLACE SAID THE SHADOW WHO CAME AND VISITED HIM THERE IS NOTHING ELSE FOR IT
IT WAS REALLY QUITE ASTONISHING HOW MUCH OF A MAN IT WAS IT WAS DRESSED ENTIRELY IN BLACK AND OF THE VERY FINEST CLOTH IT HAD PATENT LEATHER BOOTS AND A HAT THAT COULD BE FOLDED TOGETHER
POESY CRIED THE LEARNED MAN YES YES SHE OFTEN DWELLS A RECLUSE IN LARGE CITIES POESY YES I HAVE SEEN HER
AND THE SHADOW ON THE GROUND KEPT ITSELF SO STILL AND QUIET THAT IT MIGHT HEAR ALL THAT PASSED IT WISHED TO KNOW HOW IT COULD GET FREE AND WORK ITS WAY UP SO AS TO BECOME ITS OWN MASTER
I DID NOT GO QUITE IN I REMAINED IN THE FOREMOST ROOM IN THE TWILIGHT BUT I STOOD THERE QUITE WELL I SAW EVERYTHING AND I KNOW EVERYTHING I HAVE BEEN IN THE ANTECHAMBER AT THE COURT OF POESY
AND AS TO THE MUSIC IT APPEARED TO HIM TO BE EXTREMELY TIRESOME IT IS AS IF SOME ONE SAT THERE AND PRACTISED A PIECE THAT HE COULD NOT MASTER
I WILL NOT SAY FOR A CERTAINTY THAT HE CAN SAID THE SHADOW BUT I THINK SO HE HAS NOW FOLLOWED ME FOR SO MANY YEARS AND LISTENED TO MY CONVERSATION I SHOULD THINK IT POSSIBLE
THEY GREW SO WELL IN THE SUN'S HEAT AND THAT THEY COULD NOT DO UNLESS THEY WERE WATERED AND SOME ONE MUST WATER THEM THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY THERE THE DOOR OPPOSITE WAS ALSO OPENED LATE IN THE EVENING
IN THE THICK GOLD CHAIN HE WORE AROUND HIS NECK NAY HOW ALL HIS FINGERS GLITTERED WITH DIAMOND RINGS AND THEN ALL WERE PURE GEMS NAY I CANNOT RECOVER FROM MY SURPRISE SAID THE LEARNED MAN
THE MASTER OF THE MINT STRUCK NEW COIN FOR ME AND THE WOMEN SAID I WAS SO HANDSOME AND SO I BECAME THE MAN I AM
AND CANDLES BURNT YES ABOVE A THOUSAND LIGHTS WERE BURNING AND THE ONE TALKED AND THE OTHER SUNG AND PEOPLE WALKED AND CHURCH BELLS RANG AND ASSES WENT ALONG WITH A DINGLE DINGLE DONG FOR THEY TOO HAD BELLS ON
YES YOU SEE I HAVE EVEN GIVEN HIM A SHADOW IT IS SOMEWHAT EXPENSIVE BUT I LIKE TO HAVE SOMETHING FOR MYSELF WHAT THOUGHT THE PRINCESS SHOULD I REALLY BE CURED THESE BATHS ARE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD
COME NOW BE USEFUL AND DO ME A SERVICE SAID HE IN JEST HAVE THE KINDNESS TO STEP IN NOW ART THOU GOING AND THEN HE NODDED TO THE SHADOW AND THE SHADOW NODDED AGAIN
THAT YOU CANNOT CAST A SHADOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS MUST BE IMPROVING CONSIDERABLY SAID THE SHADOW I KNOW YOUR COMPLAINT IS THAT YOU SEE TOO CLEARLY BUT IT HAS DECREASED YOU ARE CURED
HE HAS COME HERE IN ORDER TO GET HIS BEARD TO GROW THEY SAY BUT I SEE THE REAL CAUSE HE CANNOT CAST A SHADOW SHE HAD BECOME INQUISITIVE
AND THAT THE SHADOW COULD REMARK FOR SHE ALMOST PIERCED HIM THROUGH WITH HER EYES SO THEY DANCED ONCE MORE TOGETHER AND SHE WAS ABOUT TO DECLARE HERSELF BUT SHE WAS DISCREET SHE THOUGHT OF HER COUNTRY AND KINGDOM
BOTH THE PRINCESS AND THE SHADOW BUT NO ONE WAS TO KNOW ABOUT IT BEFORE SHE ARRIVED IN HER OWN KINGDOM NO ONE NOT EVEN MY SHADOW SAID THE SHADOW AND HE HAD HIS OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT IT
IN THE COURSE OF THREE WEEKS HE HAD A VERY FAIR SHADOW WHICH WHEN HE SET OUT FOR HIS HOME IN THE NORTHERN LANDS GREW MORE AND MORE IN THE JOURNEY SO THAT AT LAST IT WAS SO LONG AND SO LARGE
AND SO SHE ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION DIRECTLY WITH THE STRANGE GENTLEMAN ON THEIR PROMENADES AS THE DAUGHTER OF A KING SHE NEEDED NOT TO STAND UPON TRIFLES SO SHE SAID YOUR COMPLAINT IS
DO YOU KNOW WHO LIVED IN OUR OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE SAID THE SHADOW IT WAS THE MOST CHARMING OF ALL BEINGS IT WAS POESY I WAS THERE FOR THREE WEEKS
HAD I WRITTEN A NEWSPAPER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN READ
OF THE WHOLE HUMAN VARNISH THAT MAKES A MAN PERCEPTIBLE I TOOK MY WAY I TELL IT TO YOU BUT YOU WILL NOT PUT IT IN ANY BOOK I TOOK MY WAY TO THE CAKE WOMAN I HID MYSELF BEHIND HER
AND THE CANNONS WENT OFF WITH A BUM BUM AND THE SOLDIERS PRESENTED ARMS THAT WAS A MARRIAGE THE PRINCESS AND THE SHADOW WENT OUT ON THE BALCONY TO SHOW THEMSELVES AND GET ANOTHER HURRAH
BUT NO ONE CAME IN SO HE OPENED THE DOOR AND THERE STOOD BEFORE HIM SUCH AN EXTREMELY LEAN MAN THAT HE FELT QUITE STRANGE AS TO THE REST THE MAN WAS VERY FINELY DRESSED HE MUST BE A GENTLEMAN
I LEARNED TO KNOW MY INWARD NATURE MY INNATE QUALITIES THE RELATIONSHIP I HAD WITH POESY AT THE TIME I WAS WITH YOU I THOUGHT NOT OF THAT BUT ALWAYS YOU KNOW IT WELL
THE WOMAN DIDN'T THINK HOW MUCH SHE CONCEALED I WENT OUT FIRST IN THE EVENING I RAN ABOUT THE STREETS IN THE MOONLIGHT I MADE MYSELF LONG UP THE WALLS IT TICKLES THE BACK SO DELIGHTFULLY
THE NARROW STREET WITH THE HIGH HOUSES WAS BUILT SO THAT THE SUNSHINE MUST FALL THERE FROM MORNING TILL EVENING IT WAS REALLY NOT TO BE BORNE THE LEARNED MAN FROM THE COLD LANDS HE WAS A YOUNG MAN
I RAN UP AND RAN DOWN PEEPED INTO THE HIGHEST WINDOWS INTO THE SALOONS AND ON THE ROOFS I PEEPED IN WHERE NO ONE COULD PEEP AND I SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SAW WHAT NO ONE ELSE SHOULD SEE
WELL THEN GO BUT DON'T STAY AWAY THE STRANGER ROSE AND HIS SHADOW ON THE OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR'S BALCONY ROSE ALSO
A SINGLE SHORT MOMENT BUT SLEEP CAME INTO MY EYES SHE STOOD ON THE BALCONY AND SHONE AS THE AURORA BOREALIS SHINES GO ON GO ON THOU WERT ON THE BALCONY AND WENT THROUGH THE DOORWAY
THIS IS RATHER TOO BAD THOUGHT HE THAT I MUST SAY YOU AND HE SAY THOU BUT HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PUT UP WITH IT SO THEY CAME TO A WATERING PLACE WHERE THERE WERE MANY STRANGERS
BUT NOW YOU MUST TELL ME ALL YOU SAW EVERYTHING SAID THE SHADOW FOR I SAW EVERYTHING AND I KNOW EVERYTHING HOW DID IT LOOK IN THE FURTHEST SALOON ASKED THE LEARNED MAN
AND OF THE MANY PERSONS SHE WOULD HAVE TO REIGN OVER HE IS A WISE MAN
OH I LIKE THAT SAID THE PRINCESS SO SHE WENT TO THE LEARNED MAN BY THE DOOR AND SHE SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT THE SUN AND THE MOON AND ABOUT PERSONS OUT OF AND IN THE WORLD AND HE ANSWERED WITH WISDOM AND PRUDENCE
AND THE SHADOW ALSO TURNED ROUND YES IF ANYONE HAD PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO IT THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN QUITE DISTINCTLY THAT THE SHADOW WENT IN THROUGH THE HALF OPEN BALCONY DOOR OF THEIR OPPOSITE NEIGHBOR
BUT THE ONE DOOR STOOD OPEN DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE OTHER THROUGH A LONG ROW OF ROOMS AND SALOONS AND THERE IT WAS LIGHTED UP I SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY KILLED IF I HAD GONE OVER TO THE MAIDEN BUT I WAS CIRCUMSPECT I TOOK TIME TO THINK
I TELL YOU I WAS THERE AND YOU CAN CONCEIVE THAT I SAW EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO BE SEEN HAD YOU COME OVER THERE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A MAN BUT I BECAME SO AND BESIDES
AND AMONGST THEM WAS A PRINCESS WHO WAS TROUBLED WITH SEEING TOO WELL AND THAT WAS SO ALARMING SHE DIRECTLY OBSERVED THAT THE STRANGER WHO HAD JUST COME WAS QUITE A DIFFERENT SORT OF PERSON TO ALL THE OTHERS
ONLY IMAGINE YES IT IS TRUE SUCH A POOR SHADOW SKULL CANNOT BEAR MUCH ONLY THINK MY SHADOW HAS BECOME MAD HE THINKS THAT HE IS A MAN AND THAT I
YOU SEE THAT IT IS A FEELING THAT IT IS NOT PRIDE I CANNOT ALLOW YOU TO SAY THOU TO ME BUT I WILL WILLINGLY SAY THOU TO YOU SO IT IS HALF DONE SO THE SHADOW SAID THOU TO ITS FORMER MASTER
THAT I HAVE BEEN YOUR SHADOW I INTEND TO GET BETROTHED FOR I CAN PROVIDE FOR MORE THAN ONE FAMILY BE QUITE AT THY EASE ABOUT THAT SAID THE LEARNED MAN I SHALL NOT SAY TO ANYONE WHO THOU ACTUALLY ART
THE SHADOW ALWAYS TOOK CARE TO KEEP ITSELF IN THE MASTER'S PLACE NOW THE LEARNED MAN DIDN'T THINK MUCH ABOUT THAT HE WAS A VERY KIND HEARTED MAN AND PARTICULARLY MILD AND FRIENDLY AND SO HE SAID ONE DAY TO THE SHADOW
FOR ONE MUST HAVE AIR EVEN IF ONE BE ACCUSTOMED TO BE MAHOGANY IT WAS LIVELY BOTH UP AND DOWN THE STREET TAILORS AND SHOEMAKERS AND ALL THE FOLKS MOVED OUT INTO THE STREET CHAIRS AND TABLES WERE BROUGHT FORTH
NOW ONLY THINK THAT I AM HIS SHADOW IT IS TERRIBLE SAID THE PRINCESS BUT HE IS CONFINED IS HE NOT THAT HE IS I AM AFRAID THAT HE WILL NEVER RECOVER POOR SHADOW SAID THE PRINCESS
BUT IT WAS OF NO USE IT WAS VEXATIOUS BUT IN THE WARM LANDS EVERYTHING GROWS SO QUICKLY AND AFTER THE LAPSE OF EIGHT DAYS HE OBSERVED TO HIS GREAT JOY THAT A NEW SHADOW CAME IN THE SUNSHINE
I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE A VERY UNUSUAL SHADOW DO YOU NOT SEE THAT PERSON WHO ALWAYS GOES WITH ME OTHER PERSONS HAVE A COMMON SHADOW BUT I DO NOT LIKE WHAT IS COMMON TO ALL
IT IS CERTAINLY HARD SAID THE SHADOW FOR HE WAS A FAITHFUL SERVANT AND THEN HE GAVE A SORT OF SIGH YOU ARE A NOBLE CHARACTER SAID THE PRINCESS THE WHOLE CITY WAS ILLUMINATED IN THE EVENING
IN THE LARGE BALL ROOM SHE WAS LIGHT BUT HE WAS STILL LIGHTER SHE HAD NEVER HAD SUCH A PARTNER IN THE DANCE SHE TOLD HIM FROM WHAT LAND SHE CAME AND HE KNEW THAT LAND HE HAD BEEN THERE
THE DOOR WAS AJAR AND FAR WITHIN THE MUSIC SOUNDED SO SOFT AND DELIGHTFUL ONE COULD REALLY MELT AWAY IN SWEET THOUGHTS FROM IT YET IT WAS LIKE A PIECE OF ENCHANTMENT
JUST AS THE STRANGER WENT INTO HIS OWN ROOM AND LET THE LONG CURTAIN FALL DOWN AFTER HIM NEXT MORNING THE LEARNED MAN WENT OUT TO DRINK COFFEE AND READ THE NEWSPAPERS WHAT
SO THAT IT WAS BARE CROWN AND BRIM NOT TO SPEAK OF WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW IT HAD SEALS GOLD NECK CHAIN AND DIAMOND RINGS YES THE SHADOW WAS WELL DRESSED AND IT WAS JUST THAT WHICH MADE IT QUITE A MAN
THE SHADOW WAS MASTER AND THE MASTER WAS THE SHADOW THEY DROVE WITH EACH OTHER THEY RODE AND WALKED TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE BEFORE AND BEHIND JUST AS THE SUN WAS
FOR IT NOW BEGINS TO BE AMUSING HERE I AM EXTREMELY FOND OF THAT STRANGER WOULD THAT HIS BEARD SHOULD NOT GROW FOR IN THAT CASE HE WILL LEAVE US IN THE EVENING THE PRINCESS AND THE SHADOW DANCED TOGETHER
HERE IS MY CARD I LIVE ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET AND AM ALWAYS AT HOME IN RAINY WEATHER AND SO AWAY WENT THE SHADOW THAT WAS MOST EXTRAORDINARY SAID THE LEARNED MAN
ANNE RECOVERING HERSELF SPRANG TO OPEN DOORS AND WINDOWS AND LET OUT THE GAS AND SMOKE WHICH FILLED THE ROOM THEN SHE HELPED THE GIRLS CARRY THE UNCONSCIOUS PRILLIE INTO THE PORCH
AND WAS ALL SYMPATHY OUTWARDLY NEVER MIND ANNE MOST PAINTS FADE UGLIER EVERY YEAR BUT THAT BLUE IS AS UGLY AS IT CAN BE TO BEGIN WITH SO IT'S BOUND TO FADE PRETTIER AND THE ROOF IS SHINGLED AND PAINTED ALL RIGHT

THEIR MONEY HAD GONE TO PAINT THE HALL AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY FELT THEMSELVES BITTERLY AGGRIEVED BY THE MISTAKE PUBLIC INDIGNATION CENTERED ON THE PYES ROGER PYE AND JOHN ANDREW HAD BUNGLED THE MATTER BETWEEN THEM
MOST PEOPLE GAVE VERY LIBERALLY MISTER HARRISON ANNE WAS A SWEET SOULED LASS BUT SHE COULD INSTILL SOME VENOM INTO INNOCENT ITALICS WHEN OCCASION REQUIRED WHAT COLOR ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE IT WE HAVE DECIDED ON A VERY PRETTY GREEN
KEPT BACK HER TEARS UNTIL SHE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT THEN SHE SHUT HERSELF IN THE EAST GABLE ROOM AND WEPT ALL HER SHAME AND REMORSE AND DISAPPOINTMENT INTO HER PILLOWS WEPT SO LONG THAT MARILLA GREW ALARMED INVADED THE ROOM AND INSISTED ON KNOWING WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
TAKE YOUR SEAT AND WORK OUT THE SIX PROBLEMS ON PAGE EIGHTY FOUR OF YOUR ARITHMETIC FOR PUNISHMENT SAID ANNE SAINT CLAIR LOOKED RATHER AMAZED AT HER TONE BUT HE WENT MEEKLY TO HIS DESK AND TOOK OUT HIS SLATE THEN HE STEALTHILY PASSED A SMALL PARCEL TO JOE SLOANE ACROSS THE AISLE
AND WHEN BARBARA SHAW CAME UP TO THE DESK WITH A SUM SHE TRIPPED OVER THE COAL SCUTTLE WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS THE COAL ROLLED TO EVERY PART OF THE ROOM HER SLATE WAS BROKEN INTO FRAGMENTS AND WHEN SHE PICKED HERSELF UP HER FACE STAINED WITH COAL DUST SENT THE BOYS INTO ROARS OF LAUGHTER
FOLKS ARE EVERLASTING BEGGING FOR MONEY HERE IT SEEMS TO ME HOW'S YOUR PROJECT OF PAINTING THE HALL COMING ON SPLENDIDLY WE HAD A MEETING OF THE A V I S LAST FRIDAY NIGHT AND FOUND THAT WE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY SUBSCRIBED TO PAINT THE HALL AND SHINGLE THE ROOF TOO
AND ASKED HER TO TELL ME THE TRUTH ABOUT THE LETTER ANNETTA CRIED AND FESSED UP FREELY SHE SAID SHE HAD NEVER WRITTEN A LETTER AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO OR WHAT TO SAY
JOE SLOANE STOOD AS ONE TRANSFIXED IN THE MIDST OF THE COMMOTION AND SAINT CLAIR HELPLESS WITH LAUGHTER ROCKED TO AND FRO IN THE AISLE PRILLIE ROGERSON FAINTED AND ANNETTA BELL WENT INTO HYSTERICS
ANNE TOOK HER POINTER FROM HER DESK IT WAS A LONG HEAVY HARDWOOD POINTER COME HERE ANTHONY IT WAS FAR FROM BEING THE MOST SEVERE PUNISHMENT ANTHONY PYE HAD EVER UNDERGONE ANNE

ANNE CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT AND JUMPED TO A FATAL CONCLUSION ABOUT THAT PARCEL OLD MISSUS HIRAM SLOANE HAD LATELY TAKEN TO MAKING AND SELLING NUT CAKES BY WAY OF ADDING TO HER SCANTY INCOME THE CAKES WERE SPECIALLY TEMPTING TO SMALL BOYS
I SAID SOME DREADFUL THINGS TO MISSUS LYNDE LONG AGO BUT IT WAS WHEN I HAD LOST MY TEMPER I COULDN'T SAY THEM DELIBERATELY IT WAS THE TRUTH AND I BELIEVE IN TELLING THE TRUTH TO EVERYBODY
NORA WAS THE FIRST ONE OF THEM I GOT ACQUAINTED WITH AND SO I THINK I LOVE HER THE BEST SHE LIVES IN ANDREWS COVE AND SHE HAS BLACK HAIR AND BLACK EYES AND SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE MERMAIDS AND THE WATER KELPIES YOU OUGHT TO HEAR THE STORIES SHE CAN TELL
CHESTER SLOANE SPELLING ODORIFEROUS WITH TWO F'S WAS MADE TO FEEL THAT HE COULD NEVER LIVE DOWN THE DISGRACE OF IT EITHER IN THIS WORLD OR THAT WHICH IS TO COME
I LOVE YOU WITH MY WHOLE HEART AND SOUL AND MIND WITH ALL THERE IS OF ME TO LOVE AND I WANT TO SERVE YOU FOR EVER IT WOULD BE MY HIGHEST PRIVILEGE THAT IS WHY I TRY SO HARD TO BE GOOD IN SCHOOL AND LEARN MY LESSUNS YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL MY TEACHER
OR SOME INTERESTING THING OR PERSON THEY HAD SEEN THEY WERE TO WRITE THE LETTERS ON REAL NOTE PAPER SEAL THEM IN AN ENVELOPE AND ADDRESS THEM TO ME ALL WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM OTHER PEOPLE LAST FRIDAY MORNING I FOUND A PILE OF LETTERS ON MY DESK AND THAT EVENING I REALIZED AFRESH
MISTER ROGER PYE IS GOING TO GET THE PAINT IN TOWN TODAY WHO'S GOT THE JOB MISTER JOSHUA PYE OF CARMODY HE HAS NEARLY FINISHED THE SHINGLING WE HAD TO GIVE HIM THE CONTRACT FOR EVERY ONE OF THE PYES AND THERE ARE FOUR FAMILIES YOU KNOW

ELIZA BELL HAD SET FIRE TO HER AUNT'S CARDED ROLLS ASKED IF SHE MEANT TO DO IT SHE SAID NOT ALTOGETHER
HERE IS BARBARA SHAW'S LETTER I CAN'T REPRODUCE THE BLOTS OF THE ORIGINAL DEAR TEACHER YOU SAID WE MIGHT WRITE ABOUT A VISIT I NEVER VISITED BUT ONCE IT WAS AT MY AUNT MARY'S LAST WINTER
YOU LAUGH AT ME BECAUSE I THINK PAUL IS A GENIUS BUT I AM SURE HIS LETTER WILL CONVINCE YOU THAT HE IS A VERY UNCOMMON CHILD PAUL LIVES AWAY DOWN NEAR THE SHORE WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER AND HE HAS NO PLAYMATES NO REAL PLAYMATES
ANNE SURRENDERED HER BOOKS AND WONDERED IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY BE AWAKE ANTHONY WALKED ON IN SILENCE TO THE SCHOOL BUT WHEN ANNE TOOK HER BOOKS SHE SMILED DOWN AT HIM NOT THE STEREOTYPED KIND SMILE SHE HAD SO PERSISTENTLY ASSUMED FOR HIS BENEFIT
THAT OLD NUISANCE OF A RACHEL LYNDE WAS HERE AGAIN TODAY PESTERING ME FOR A SUBSCRIPTION TOWARDS BUYING A CARPET FOR THE VESTRY ROOM SAID MISTER HARRISON WRATHFULLY I DETEST THAT WOMAN MORE THAN ANYBODY I KNOW SHE CAN PUT A WHOLE SERMON
BEGAN PAINTING THE NEXT DAY HE WAS NOT DISTURBED IN HIS TASK THE HALL WAS SITUATED ON WHAT WAS CALLED THE LOWER ROAD IN LATE AUTUMN THIS ROAD WAS ALWAYS MUDDY AND WET AND PEOPLE GOING TO CARMODY TRAVELED BY THE LONGER UPPER ROAD
HAD BEEN BADLY USED MISSUS LYNDE TOLD THEM TO KEEP ON AND SHOW THE PYES THAT THERE REALLY WERE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO COULD DO THINGS WITHOUT MAKING A MUDDLE OF THEM MISTER MAJOR SPENCER SENT THEM WORD THAT HE WOULD CLEAN OUT ALL THE STUMPS ALONG THE ROAD FRONT OF HIS FARM AND SEED IT DOWN WITH GRASS AT HIS OWN EXPENSE
SAID THEY WOULDN'T GIVE A CENT UNLESS JOSHUA GOT IT THEY HAD SUBSCRIBED TWELVE DOLLARS BETWEEN THEM AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO MUCH TO LOSE ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IN TO THE PYES MISSUS LYNDE SAYS THEY TRY TO RUN EVERYTHING
JUST COME DOWNSTAIRS AND HAVE YOUR SUPPER YOU'LL SEE IF A GOOD CUP OF TEA AND THOSE PLUM PUFFS I MADE TODAY WON'T HEARTEN YOU UP PLUM PUFFS WON'T MINISTER TO A MIND DISEASED SAID ANNE DISCONSOLATELY
SHE HAS GOLDEN HAIR RIGHT DOWN TO HER FEET AND HER DRESS IS ALL GLITTERING AND GLISTENING LIKE GOLD THAT IS ALIVE AND SHE HAS A GOLDEN HARP AND PLAYS ON IT ALL DAY LONG YOU CAN HEAR THE MUSIC ANY TIME ALONG SHORE IF YOU LISTEN CAREFULLY
AND THE MORTON HARRIS PAINT CANS WERE NUMBERED ACCORDING TO A COLOR CARD A PURCHASER CHOSE HIS SHADE ON THE CARD AND ORDERED BY THE ACCOMPANYING NUMBER
ANNE HAD WARNED THEM THAT IF THEY BROUGHT ANY MORE CAKES TO SCHOOL THEY WOULD BE CONFISCATED AND YET HERE WAS SAINT CLAIR DONNELL COOLLY PASSING A PARCEL OF THEM WRAPPED UP IN THE BLUE AND WHITE STRIPED PAPER MISSUS HIRAM USED UNDER HER VERY EYES
THE HALL WAS SO CLOSELY SURROUNDED BY FIR WOODS THAT IT WAS INVISIBLE UNLESS YOU WERE NEAR IT MISTER JOSHUA PYE PAINTED AWAY IN THE SOLITUDE AND INDEPENDENCE THAT WERE SO DEAR TO HIS UNSOCIABLE HEART FRIDAY AFTERNOON HE FINISHED HIS JOB AND WENT HOME TO CARMODY
HE IS THE ONLY ONE I CAN'T HELP IT I WANT EVERYBODY TO LOVE ME AND IT HURTS ME SO WHEN ANYBODY DOESN'T AND ANTHONY NEVER WILL NOW OH I JUST MADE AN IDIOT OF MYSELF TODAY MARILLA I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY
I MUST I HAVE SOME SEWING TO DO FOR DORA THIS EVENING BESIDES DAVY IS PROBABLY BREAKING MARILLA'S HEART WITH SOME NEW MISCHIEF BY THIS TIME THIS MORNING THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS WHERE DOES THE DARK GO ANNE I WANT TO KNOW
AND I MEAN TO TELL YOU ABOUT THEM I HAVE NEVER TOLD ANYBODY ABOUT THEM EXCEPT GRANDMA AND FATHER BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THINGS THERE ARE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND THINGS SO THERE IS NO USE IN TELLING THEM
I PUT TEACHER WHERE HE PUT LADY AND I PUT IN SOMETHING OF MY OWN WHEN I COULD THINK OF IT AND I CHANGED SOME WORDS I PUT DRESS IN PLACE OF MOOD
BECAUSE I'D PROMISED GRANDMOTHER I'D NEVER ASSOCIATE WITH ANYBODY THAT SWORE HE WAS PRETTY WELL SCARED I CAN TELL YOU AND HE SAID IF I WOULD FORGIVE HIM HE WOULD TAKE ME TO THE SUNSET SO THE NEXT EVENING WHEN I WAS SITTING ON THE STRIPED ROCKS
AND NEVER SAID A WORD WHEN TIMOTHY COTTON STOLE A CROCK OF BUTTER OUT OF HER DAIRY AND TOLD HIS WIFE HE'D BOUGHT IT FROM HER MISSUS COTTON CAST IT UP TO HER THE NEXT TIME THEY MET THAT IT TASTED OF TURNIPS AND MISSUS LYNDE JUST SAID SHE WAS SORRY IT HAD TURNED OUT SO POORLY
AND AS FOR JOSHUA PYE HE MUST BE A BORN FOOL NOT TO SUSPECT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN HE OPENED THE CANS AND SAW THE COLOR OF THE PAINT JOSHUA PYE WHEN THUS ANIMADVERTED UPON RETORTED THAT THE AVONLEA TASTE IN COLORS WAS NO BUSINESS OF HIS
BECAUSE HER COUSIN IN MONTREAL WENT ON A HONEYMOON WHEN HE WAS MARRIED AND HE HAD ALWAYS HAD THE VERY LATEST IN BICYCLES ANOTHER DAY I ASKED THEM ALL TO TELL ME THE NAUGHTIEST THING THEY HAD EVER DONE I COULDN'T GET THE OLDER ONES TO DO SO BUT THE THIRD CLASS ANSWERED QUITE FREELY
BECAUSE IT WOULD RAIN THE NEXT DAY IT'S SO HARD NOT TO LAUGH STELLA I HAVE TO SAVE UP ALL MY AMUSEMENT UNTIL I GET HOME AND MARILLA SAYS IT MAKES HER NERVOUS TO HEAR WILD SHRIEKS OF MIRTH PROCEEDING FROM THE EAST GABLE WITHOUT ANY APPARENT CAUSE
I KNOW I HAVE RED HAIR TOO ALTHOUGH IT'S MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE SO THERE'S NO NEED OF TELLING ME THAT EITHER WELL WELL I'LL TRY AND NOT MENTION IT AGAIN SINCE YOU'RE SO SENSITIVE
WHEN WE GOT UP I STEPPED ON HER DRESS AND ALL THE GATHERS TORE OUT OF THE SKIRT THE NEXT MORNING WHEN I GOT UP I HIT THE PITCHER AGAINST THE BASIN AND CRACKED THEM BOTH AND I UPSET A CUP OF TEA ON THE TABLECLOTH AT BREAKFAST
BUT THE OLDEST TWIN SAYS IT WAS ONLY A FEW MINUTES YOU SEE IN THE SUNSET LAND THE TIME IS EVER SO MUCH LONGER THAN IT IS HERE YOUR LOVING PUPIL PAUL IRVING
BUT I CAN'T HELP LOVING PAUL IRVING THE BEST OF ALL MINE I DON'T THINK IT DOES ANY HARM THOUGH FOR EVERYBODY LOVES PAUL EVEN MISSUS LYNDE WHO SAYS SHE COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED SHE'D GET SO FOND OF A YANKEE THE OTHER BOYS IN SCHOOL LIKE HIM TOO
HE LETS IT SLEEP ON HIS ROCKING CHARE AND MY AUNT SAYS HE THINKS MORE OF IT THAN HE DOES OF HIS CHILDREN THAT IS NOT RIGHT WE OUGHT TO BE KIND TO CATS AND GIVE THEM NEW MILK BUT WE OUGHT NOT BE BETTER TO THEM THAN TO OUR CHILDREN
WHEN I WAS HELPING AUNT MARY WITH THE DINNER DISHES I DROPPED A CHINA PLATE AND IT SMASHED THAT EVENING I FELL DOWNSTAIRS AND SPRAINED MY ANKLE AND HAD TO STAY IN BED FOR A WEEK I HEARD AUNT MARY TELL UNCLE JOSEPH IT WAS A MERCY OR I'D HAVE BROKEN EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE
BUT IF YOU WERE A WIDOW THERE'D BE NO DANGER OF EITHER THE MOST REMARKABLE WISH WAS SALLY BELL'S SHE WANTED A HONEYMOON
WHERE BARBARA SHAW IN AN AGONY OF DESIRE TO BE USEFUL POURED A PAILFUL OF HALF FROZEN WATER OVER PRILLIE'S FACE AND SHOULDERS BEFORE ANYONE COULD STOP HER IT WAS A FULL HOUR BEFORE QUIET WAS RESTORED
ARRIVING AT THIS MOMENT WITH A BANDBOX HE HAD BROUGHT FROM TOWN FOR MARILLA HAVEN'T YOU HEARD SAID JANE WRATHFULLY WELL ITS SIMPLY THIS JOSHUA PYE HAS GONE AND PAINTED THE HALL BLUE INSTEAD OF GREEN A DEEP BRILLIANT BLUE
SHE WENT TO SCHOOL IN NO ANGELIC MOOD HER CHEEK WAS SWOLLEN AND HER FACE ACHED THE SCHOOLROOM WAS COLD AND SMOKY FOR THE FIRE REFUSED TO BURN AND THE CHILDREN WERE HUDDLED ABOUT IT IN SHIVERING GROUPS
IT'S HEARTBREAKING AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE WE'VE HAD HOW ON EARTH COULD SUCH A MISTAKE HAVE HAPPENED WAILED DIANA THE BLAME OF THIS UNMERCIFUL DISASTER WAS EVENTUALLY NARROWED DOWN TO THE PYES THE IMPROVERS HAD DECIDED TO USE MORTON HARRIS PAINTS
ANNE TURNED FROM THE SECOND READER CLASS WHICH SHE WAS HEARING REALLY BARBARA SHE SAID ICILY IF YOU CANNOT MOVE WITHOUT FALLING OVER SOMETHING YOU'D BETTER REMAIN IN YOUR SEAT IT IS POSITIVELY DISGRACEFUL FOR A GIRL OF YOUR AGE TO BE SO AWKWARD
REALLY HELD AN ASSORTMENT OF FIRECRACKERS AND PINWHEELS FOR WHICH WARREN SLOANE HAD SENT TO TOWN BY SAINT CLAIR DONNELL'S FATHER THE DAY BEFORE INTENDING TO HAVE A BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION THAT EVENING
EVERY MORN IS THE WORLD MADE NEW SANG ANNE AS SHE DRESSED OWING TO THE SNOW SHE HAD TO GO AROUND BY THE ROAD TO SCHOOL AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS CERTAINLY AN IMPISH COINCIDENCE THAT ANTHONY PYE SHOULD COME PLOUGHING ALONG JUST AS SHE LEFT THE GREEN GABLES LANE
HE'S PECULIAR ENOUGH ALL RIGHT THEN SAID MISTER HARRISON DRILY
MY AUNT MARY IS A VERY PARTICULAR WOMAN AND A GREAT HOUSEKEEPER THE FIRST NIGHT I WAS THERE WE WERE AT TEA I KNOCKED OVER A JUG AND BROKE IT AUNT MARY SAID SHE HAD HAD THAT JUG EVER SINCE SHE WAS MARRIED AND NOBODY HAD EVER BROKEN IT BEFORE
I NEVER WAS MUCH OF A TALKER TILL I CAME TO AVONLEA AND THEN I HAD TO BEGIN IN SELF DEFENSE OR MISSUS LYNDE WOULD HAVE SAID I WAS DUMB AND STARTED A SUBSCRIPTION TO HAVE ME TAUGHT SIGN LANGUAGE
A JONAH DAY IT REALLY BEGAN THE NIGHT BEFORE WITH A RESTLESS WAKEFUL VIGIL OF GRUMBLING TOOTHACHE WHEN ANNE AROSE IN THE DULL BITTER WINTER MORNING SHE FELT THAT LIFE WAS FLAT STALE AND UNPROFITABLE
NO BUT THE PYES ARE AN EXCEPTION TO EVERY KNOWN RULE THAT'S WHAT DECLARED MISSUS RACHEL WITH CONVICTION
HANNAH BELL WANTED TO BE GOOD WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE ANY TROUBLE ABOUT IT MARJORY WHITE AGED TEN WANTED TO BE A WIDOW QUESTIONED WHY SHE GRAVELY SAID THAT IF YOU WEREN'T MARRIED PEOPLE CALLED YOU AN OLD MAID AND IF YOU WERE YOUR HUSBAND BOSSED YOU
AND WHEN MISTER ROGER PYE SENT WORD TO THE IMPROVERS BY HIS SON JOHN ANDREW THAT HE WAS GOING TO TOWN AND WOULD GET THEIR PAINT FOR THEM
THE LUCKLESS IMPROVERS EXPECTED THAT AVONLEA WOULD BE MORE PREJUDICED THAN EVER AGAINST THEM BUT INSTEAD PUBLIC SYMPATHY VEERED AROUND IN THEIR FAVOR
EXCUSE ME YOU MUSTN'T MIND IT IT'S JUST A HABIT I'VE GOT YOU'D THINK HE WAS CRAZY WOULDN'T YOU AND AS FOR MISSUS LYNDE BEING A BUSYBODY PERHAPS SHE IS BUT DID YOU TELL HER SHE HAD A VERY KIND HEART AND ALWAYS HELPED THE POOR
HE IS OLL STRIPED AND HE GOT ONE OF HIS EARS FROZ OF LAST WINTER ONLY FOR THAT HE WOULD BE A GOOD LOOKING CAT MY UNKLE HAS ADOPTED A CAT IT COME TO HIS HOUSE ONE DAY AND WOUDENT GO AWAY AND UNKLE SAYS IT HAS FORGOT MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE EVER KNOWED
IT IS JUST THAT HE HAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF TACT OR IMAGINATION DEAR MISS SHIRLEY YOU TOLD US TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING STRANGE WE HAVE SEEN I WILL DESCRIBE THE AVONLEA HALL IT HAS TWO DOORS AN INSIDE ONE AND AN OUTSIDE ONE
THEN THERE ARE THE TWIN SAILORS THEY DON'T LIVE ANYWHERE THEY SAIL ALL THE TIME BUT THEY OFTEN COME ASHORE TO TALK TO ME THEY ARE A PAIR OF JOLLY TARS AND THEY HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD AND MORE THAN WHAT IS IN THE WORLD
BUT MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK IT WAS ONLY THE WIND AMONG THE ROCKS I'VE NEVER TOLD NORA ABOUT THE GOLDEN LADY I WAS AFRAID IT MIGHT HURT HER FEELINGS IT EVEN HURT HER FEELINGS IF I TALKED TOO LONG WITH THE TWIN SAILORS I ALWAYS MET THE TWIN SAILORS AT THE STRIPED ROCKS
AND IT SOUNDS THE DEATH KNELL OF OUR SOCIETY WE'LL SIMPLY BE LAUGHED OUT OF EXISTENCE IN LIFE AS IN DREAMS HOWEVER THINGS OFTEN GO BY CONTRARIES THE AVONLEA PEOPLE DID NOT LAUGH THEY WERE TOO ANGRY
IT HAD SNOWED SOFTLY AND THICKLY ALL THROUGH THE HOURS OF DARKNESS AND THE BEAUTIFUL WHITENESS GLITTERING IN THE FROSTY SUNSHINE LOOKED LIKE A MANTLE OF CHARITY CAST OVER ALL THE MISTAKES AND HUMILIATIONS OF THE PAST EVERY MORN IS A FRESH BEGINNING
OH MARILLA I HAVE TRIED SO HARD TO BE PATIENT AND TO WIN ANTHONY'S LIKING AND NOW IT HAS ALL GONE FOR NOTHING MARILLA PASSED HER HARD WORK WORN HAND OVER THE GIRL'S GLOSSY TUMBLED HAIR WITH A WONDERFUL TENDERNESS
AND HERS ARE GENERALLY AS BRIEF AS SAINT CLAIR'S ANNETTA IS A QUIET LITTLE PUSS AND A MODEL OF GOOD BEHAVIOR BUT THERE ISN'T A SHADOW OF ORGINALITY IN HER HERE IS HER LETTER DEAREST TEACHER I THINK I WILL WRITE YOU A LETTER TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU
THERE IS NOTHING WEAK OR GIRLISH ABOUT HIM IN SPITE OF HIS DREAMS AND FANCIES HE IS VERY MANLY AND CAN HOLD HIS OWN IN ALL GAMES HE FOUGHT SAINT CLAIR DONNELL RECENTLY BECAUSE SAINT CLAIR SAID THE UNION JACK WAS AWAY AHEAD OF THE STARS AND STRIPES AS A FLAG
THE POOR BIRD HAS BEEN MOPING EVER SINCE THOSE CHILDREN MUST BE A SIGHT OF TROUBLE TO YOU FOLKS EVERYTHING THAT'S WORTH HAVING IS SOME TROUBLE SAID ANNE SECRETLY RESOLVING TO FORGIVE DAVY'S NEXT OFFENCE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE SINCE HE HAD AVENGED HER ON GINGER
IT HAS SIX WINDOWS AND A CHIMNEY IT HAS TWO ENDS AND TWO SIDES IT IS PAINTED BLUE THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT STRANGE IT IS BUILT ON THE LOWER CARMODY ROAD IT IS THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT BUILDING IN AVONLEA THE OTHERS ARE THE CHURCH AND THE BLACKSMITH SHOP
HE PEERED ACROSS HIS BOOK AT ANNE HIS BLACK EYES SPARKLING WITH CURIOSITY AND MOCKERY ANNE TWITCHED OPEN THE DRAWER OF HER DESK IN SEARCH OF CHALK AND UNDER HER VERY HAND A LIVELY MOUSE SPRANG OUT OF THE DRAWER SCAMPERED OVER THE DESK AND LEAPED TO THE FLOOR
BUT A SUDDEN OUTFLASHING OF GOOD COMRADESHIP ANTHONY SMILED NO IF THE TRUTH MUST BE TOLD ANTHONY GRINNED BACK A GRIN IS NOT GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE A RESPECTFUL THING
TEXT COMMENT AND APPLICATION INTO SIX WORDS AND THROW IT AT YOU LIKE A BRICK ANNE WHO WAS PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF THE VERANDA ENJOYING THE CHARM OF A MILD WEST WIND BLOWING ACROSS A NEWLY PLOUGHED FIELD ON A GRAY NOVEMBER TWILIGHT
THE SHADE THEY USE FOR PAINTING CARTS AND WHEELBARROWS AND MISSUS LYNDE SAYS IT IS THE MOST HIDEOUS COLOR FOR A BUILDING ESPECIALLY WHEN COMBINED WITH A RED ROOF THAT SHE EVER SAW OR IMAGINED YOU COULD SIMPLY HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH A FEATHER WHEN I HEARD IT
I DIDN'T LIKE MISSUS LYNDE AT FIRST EITHER BUT AS SOON AS I CAME TO UNDERSTAND HER I LEARNED TO MISSUS LYNDE MAY BE AN ACQUIRED TASTE WITH SOME FOLKS
I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT MY VERY BRAVE AUNT SHE LIVES IN ONTARIO AND ONE DAY SHE WENT OUT TO THE BARN AND SAW A DOG IN THE YARD THE DOG HAD NO BUSINESS THERE SO SHE GOT A STICK AND WHACKED HIM HARD AND DROVE HIM INTO THE BARN AND SHUT HIM UP PRETTY SOON A MAN CAME LOOKING FOR AN INAGINARY LION
FOLKS WILL BE ABLE TO SIT IN THE HALL AFTER THIS WITHOUT BEING LEAKED ON YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH ANYHOW
PLEASE MISS I HAD TO HELP MA MAKE A PUDDING FOR DINNER CAUSE WE'RE EXPECTING COMPANY AND CLARICE ALMIRA'S SICK WAS SAINT CLAIR'S ANSWER GIVEN IN A PERFECTLY RESPECTFUL VOICE BUT NEVERTHELESS PROVOCATIVE OF GREAT MIRTH AMONG HIS MATES
YOU MUST EXCUSE ME ANNE I'VE GOT A HABIT OF BEING OUTSPOKEN AND FOLKS MUSTN'T MIND IT BUT THEY CAN'T HELP MINDING IT AND I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY HELP THAT IT'S YOUR HABIT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A PERSON WHO WENT ABOUT STICKING PINS AND NEEDLES INTO PEOPLE AND SAYING
ESPECIALLY AS SHE DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHERE THE MOUSE HAD GONE BUT SHE DECIDED NOT TO WHO COULD TAKE ANY COMFORT OUT OF HYSTERICS WITH A TEACHER SO WHITE FACED AND SO BLAZING EYED STANDING BEFORE ONE WHO PUT THAT MOUSE IN MY DESK SAID ANNE
TEACHING IS REALLY VERY INTERESTING WORK WROTE ANNE TO A QUEEN'S ACADEMY CHUM JANE SAYS SHE THINKS IT IS MONOTONOUS BUT I DON'T FIND IT SO SOMETHING FUNNY IS ALMOST SURE TO HAPPEN EVERY DAY AND THE CHILDREN SAY SUCH AMUSING THINGS
SHE SAT DOWN AT HER DESK FEELING ASHAMED REPENTANT AND BITTERLY MORTIFIED HER QUICK ANGER WAS GONE AND SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEEK RELIEF IN TEARS SO ALL HER BOASTS HAD COME TO THIS SHE HAD ACTUALLY WHIPPED ONE OF HER PUPILS
HE HAD SOME WONDERFUL ADVENTURES IN THE MOON BUT IT WOULD MAKE THIS LETTER TOO LONG TO TELL THEM THEN THERE IS THE GOLDEN LADY OF THE CAVE ONE DAY I FOUND A BIG CAVE DOWN ON THE SHORE AND I WENT AWAY IN AND AFTER A WHILE I FOUND THE GOLDEN LADY
HER VOICE WAS QUITE LOW BUT IT MADE A SHIVER GO UP AND DOWN PAUL IRVING'S SPINE JOE SLOANE CAUGHT HER EYE FELT RESPONSIBLE FROM THE CROWN OF HIS HEAD TO THE SOLE OF HIS FEET BUT STUTTERED OUT WILDLY
SAINT CLAIR SAYS HE CAN HIT THE HARDEST BUT PAUL CAN HIT THE OFTENEST PAUL'S LETTER MY DEAR TEACHER YOU TOLD US WE MIGHT WRITE YOU ABOUT SOME INTERESTING PEOPLE WE KNEW I THINK THE MOST INTERESTING PEOPLE I KNOW ARE MY ROCK PEOPLE
IT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO OH NO NO MARILLA AND I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN EVER LOOK THOSE CHILDREN IN THE FACE AGAIN I FEEL THAT I HAVE HUMILIATED MYSELF TO THE VERY DUST YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CROSS AND HATEFUL AND HORRID I WAS
P E ISLAND CAN BIRDS DEAR TEACHER I THINK I WILL WRITE YOU A COMPOSITION ABOUT BIRDS BIRDS IS VERY USEFUL ANIMALS MY CAT CATCHES BIRDS HIS NAME IS WILLIAM BUT PA CALLS HIM TOM
YOU CAN'T HOLD HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MISTAKE SINCE HE CLAIMS HE WAS NEVER TOLD WHAT THE COLOR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BUT JUST GIVEN THE CANS AND TOLD TO GO AHEAD BUT IT'S A BURNING SHAME AND THAT HALL CERTAINLY DOES LOOK AWFUL
TO TELL HER THAT IF THE SASSIETY WANTED TO MAKE A GERANIUM BED AT THE CROSSROADS IN THE SPRING THEY NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF HER COW FOR SHE WOULD SEE THAT THE MARAUDING ANIMAL WAS KEPT WITHIN SAFE BOUNDS EVEN MISTER HARRISON CHUCKLED IF HE CHUCKLED AT ALL IN PRIVATE
AND THERE THE MATTER STANDS TO THIS DAY THAT NIGHT THERE WAS BLANK DISMAY IN EVERY AVONLEA HOUSE WHERE AN IMPROVER LIVED THE GLOOM AT GREEN GABLES WAS SO INTENSE THAT IT QUENCHED EVEN DAVY ANNE WEPT AND WOULD NOT BE COMFORTED
BUT THE KNOWLEDGE ONLY ANGERED HER FURTHER
BUT THEIR WAY WAS A VERY DIFFERENT ONE FROM ANY WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED BY THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP THEY ROWED OFF INTO THE DARKNESS INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE TOWN AND WAITED UNTIL NEARLY DAYBREAK THEN THEY BOLDLY MADE FOR THE MAN OF WAR
HE CUT DOWN A NUMBER OF SMALL TREES AND WHEN HE HAD ENOUGH OF THESE SLENDER TRUNKS HE BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH REEDS AND OSIERS WHICH HE FOUND ON THE RIVER BANK SO AFTER INFINITE LABOR AND TRIAL HE CONSTRUCTED A RAFT WHICH WOULD BEAR HIM ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
AND THEY FEARED THAT WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT NO BUCCANEER WAS TO RECEIVE QUARTER THE SPANISH COLONISTS WOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME WAY NO MATTER WHERE THEY MIGHT BE FOUND AND TAKEN
NOW I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE ETERNAL THUNDERS WE WAS MARCHED INTO THESE WOODS FOR ANYHOW UNLESS IT WAS TO GIVE THE REBS A REGULAR POT SHOT AT US WE CAME IN HERE AND GOT OUR LEGS ALL TANGLED UP IN THESE CUSSED BRIERS
OH THE DEVIL IT WILL YOU ALWAYS TALK LIKE A DOG HANGED PARSON DON'T TELL ME I KNOW
WHEN THIS MESSAGE WAS RECEIVED BY THE DIGNIFIED OFFICIAL WHO FILLED THE POST OF GOVERNOR OF CUBA HE STORMED AND FAIRLY FOAMED AT THE MOUTH TO BE UTTERLY FOILED AND DISCOMFITED BY THIS RESURRECTED PIRATE
BARING HIS MUSCULAR AND HAIRY RIGHT ARM HE CLUTCHED THE HANDLE OF HIS SHARP AND HEAVY CUTLASS AND ORDERED THE PRISONERS TO BE BROUGHT UP FROM BELOW ONE AT A TIME AND CONDUCTED TO THE PLACE WHERE HE STOOD
BUT NO ONE QUESTIONED HIS RIGHT TO DEAL IN SUCH WORDS AND PRESENTLY HE RECOVERED HIS AIR OF COURAGE HE WENT ON TO REPEAT A STATEMENT HE HAD HEARD GOING FROM GROUP TO GROUP AT THE CAMP THAT MORNING THE BRIGADIER SAID HE NEVER SAW A NEW REG'MENT FIGHT THE WAY WE FOUGHT YESTIRDAY DIDN'T HE
THE ANIMALS MIGHT HOWL AROUND HIM AND GLARE AT HIM WITH THEIR SHINING EYES AND THE ALLIGATORS MIGHT LASH THE WATER INTO FOAM WITH THEIR GREAT TAILS
AND WHERE THE WATER WHICH COVERED THE GROUND PREVENTED THE DOGS FROM FOLLOWING HIS SCENT HE HAD NOTHING TO EAT EXCEPT A FEW ROOTS OF WATER PLANTS BUT HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO PRIVATION AND THESE KEPT HIM ALIVE OFTEN HE HEARD THE HOUNDS BAYING ON THE DRY LAND ADJOINING THE MARSH
AND THEN WE BEGIN TO FIGHT AND THE REBS HAD AN EASY TIME OF IT DON'T TELL ME IT'S JUST LUCK I KNOW BETTER IT'S THIS DERNED OLD THE FRIEND SEEMED JADED BUT HE INTERRUPTED HIS COMRADE WITH A VOICE OF CALM CONFIDENCE
HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING RID OF HIS FETTERS AND COULD MOVE ABOUT AS FREELY AS A TIGER IN A CAGE TO GET OUT OF THIS CAGE WAS BARTHOLEMY'S FIRST OBJECT IT WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY EASY BECAUSE IN THE COURSE OF TIME SOME ONE WOULD COME INTO THE HOLD
AND WAS ABOUT TO FALL UPON A PEACEFUL LITTLE VILLAGE ON THE ISLAND OVER WHICH HE RULED FILLED THE GOVERNOR WITH RAGE AS WELL AS AMAZEMENT AND HE ORDERED A WELL ARMED SHIP WITH A LARGE CREW OF FIGHTING MEN TO SAIL IMMEDIATELY FOR DE LOS CAYOS
LIKE BIRDS BUT THEY WERE NOW FOR THE MOST PART BLACK CREATURES WHO FLAPPED THEIR WINGS DREARILY NEAR TO THE GROUND AND REFUSED TO RISE ON ANY WINGS OF HOPE THE MEN'S FACES GREW DOLEFUL FROM THE INTERPRETING OF OMENS
BARTHOLEMY PERCEIVED AN OLD BOARD IN WHICH THERE WERE SOME LONG AND HEAVY RUSTY NAILS GREATLY ENCOURAGED BY THIS DISCOVERY THE INDEFATIGABLE TRAVELLER SET ABOUT A WORK WHICH RESEMBLED THAT OF THE OLD WOMAN WHO WANTED A NEEDLE
WHO HAD BEEN PRESERVED FROM THE FATE OF THE OTHERS BECAUSE L'OLONNOIS HAD SOME CORRESPONDENCE TO ATTEND TO AND HE NEEDED A MESSENGER TO CARRY A LETTER THE PIRATE CAPTAIN WENT INTO THE CABIN WHERE HE FOUND WRITING MATERIALS READY TO HIS HAND
AND TO BE AFTERWARDS ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF SUCH UNHEARD OF INSOLENCE AND ABUSE WAS MORE THAN HE COULD BEAR AND IN THE PRESENCE OF MANY OF HIS OFFICIALS AND ATTENDANTS HE SWORE A TERRIBLE OATH THAT AFTER THAT HOUR HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN GIVE QUARTER TO ANY BUCCANEER
AND WHEN THE POOR FELLOW HAD FINISHED BY TELLING THAT HE HAD COME THERE NOT OF HIS OWN ACCORD BUT SIMPLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBEYING HIS MASTER TO HANG ALL THE PIRATES EXCEPT THEIR LEADER THAT GREAT BUCCANEER LAUGHED AND FINDING HE COULD GET NOTHING MORE FROM THE NEGRO
WHEN THE LITTLE FLEET OF SPANISH VESSELS INCLUDING THE ONE WHICH HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY BARTHOLEMY PORTUGUEZ AND HIS MEN WERE ON THEIR WAY TO CAMPEACHY THEY MET WITH VERY STORMY WEATHER SO THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED AND THE SHIP WHICH CONTAINED BARTHOLEMY AND HIS COMPANIONS ARRIVED FIRST AT THE PORT FOR WHICH THEY WERE BOUND
AND THERE HE COMPOSED A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR OF HAVANA A PART OF WHICH READ AS FOLLOWS I SHALL NEVER HENCEFORWARD GIVE QUARTER UNTO ANY SPANIARD WHATSOEVER
ALL QUIET ON THE RAPPAHANNOCK BUT THE GUNS REFUSED TO PERMIT EVEN A COMMENT UPON THEIR UPROAR HE NEVER SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED THE SENTENCE BUT AT LAST THE GUNS STOPPED AND AMONG THE MEN IN THE RIFLE PITS RUMORS AGAIN FLEW
AND IT COULD ALWAYS BE SEEN THAT THEY WERE BEWILDERED BY THE ALLEGED NEWS AND COULD NOT FULLY COMPREHEND A DEFEAT BEFORE THE GRAY MISTS HAD BEEN TOTALLY OBLITERATED BY THE SUN RAYS THE REGIMENT WAS MARCHING IN A SPREAD COLUMN THAT WAS RETIRING CAREFULLY THROUGH THE WOODS
CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS REPRESENTED TO THE GOVERNOR THAT HIS PLAN OF VENGEANCE WOULD WORK MOST DISASTROUSLY FOR THE SPANISH SETTLERS FOR THE BUCCANEERS COULD DO FAR MORE DAMAGE TO THEM THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY DO TO THESE DREADFUL BRETHREN OF THE COAST
IT SEEMED THAT THE CANNON HAD COME FROM ALL PARTS AND WERE ENGAGED IN A STUPENDOUS WRANGLE IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A SENTENCE HEARD THE YOUTH WISHED TO LAUNCH A JOKE A QUOTATION FROM NEWSPAPERS HE DESIRED TO SAY
WHO WERE LYING DOWN BEHIND WHATEVER PROTECTION THEY HAD COLLECTED A BATTERY HAD TRUNDLED INTO POSITION IN THE REAR AND WAS THOUGHTFULLY SHELLING THE DISTANCE THE REGIMENT UNMOLESTED AS YET
ALWAYS THE NOISE OF SKIRMISHERS CAME FROM THE WOODS ON THE FRONT AND LEFT AND THE DIN ON THE RIGHT HAD GROWN TO FRIGHTFUL PROPORTIONS THE GUNS WERE ROARING WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S PAUSE FOR BREATH
THEY WERE WORN EXHAUSTED HAVING SLEPT BUT LITTLE AND LABORED MUCH
AND HE DID NOT AT ALL DESIRE TO GIVE UP SUCH A VALUABLE ADDITION TO HIS CREW BUT THE MERCHANT GREW VERY ANGRY FOR HE KNEW THAT BARTHOLEMY HAD INFLICTED GREAT INJURY ON SPANISH COMMERCE AND AS THE CAPTAIN WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM HE WENT TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE TOWN AND REPORTED THE CASE
THAT HE HAD COME BACK A COMPARATIVE PAUPER SURPRISED NO ONE FOR THIS WAS A COMMON THING TO HAPPEN TO A PIRATE BUT THE WONDER WAS THAT HE GOT BACK AT ALL HE HAD NO MONEY BUT BY THE EXERCISE OF HIS CRAFTY ABILITIES
BUT A MAN IN HIS SITUATION WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO GIVE UP READILY
WHICH WAS WHAT HE WISHED TO DO IF THE HOUNDS SHOULD GET UPON HIS TRAIL HE WAS A LOST MAN THE DESPERATE PIRATE THEREFORE DETERMINED TO GIVE THE BLOODHOUNDS NO CHANCE TO FOLLOW HIM AND FOR THREE DAYS HE REMAINED IN A MARSHY FOREST IN THE DARK RECESSES OF WHICH HE COULD HIDE
NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE WE GO OR WHY WE GO WE JUST GET FIRED AROUND FROM PILLAR TO POST AND GET LICKED HERE AND GET LICKED THERE AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S DONE FOR IT MAKES A MAN FEEL LIKE A DAMN KITTEN IN A BAG
IF THEY MET AN ENEMY WHO WAS WEAK THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM AND IF THEY MET WITH ONE WHO WAS A GOOD DEAL STRONGER THAN THEMSELVES THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM ALL THE SAME WHEN THE TIME CAME TO FIGHT THEY FOUGHT
AND HE ALSO NEEDED A LARGER FORCE THAN HE HAD WITH HIM AND HE THEREFORE CAPTURED SOME MEN WHO WERE FISHING ALONG THE COAST AND PUT THEM INTO HIS CANOES TO HELP WORK THE OARS THEN BY NIGHT HE PROCEEDED SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPANISH VESSEL
HE CRUISED ABOUT THE COAST AT SOME DISTANCE FROM DE LOS CAYOS ENDEAVORING TO PROCURE TWO SMALL BOATS IN WHICH TO APPROACH THE TOWN BUT ALTHOUGH HIS PREPARATIONS WERE MADE AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE THE PRESENCE OF HIS VESSEL WAS DISCOVERED BY SOME FISHERMEN
BY THE TIME THE WAR VESSEL HAD ARRIVED AT DE LOS CAYOS L'OLONNOIS HAD MADE HIS PREPARATION TO ATTACK THE PLACE HE HAD PROCURED TWO LARGE CANOES AND IN THESE HE HAD INTENDED TO ROW UP TO THE TOWN AND LAND WITH HIS MEN
WHICH HE MADE AS SHARP AS HE COULD THEN WITH THESE TOOLS HE UNDERTOOK THE CONSTRUCTION OF A RAFT WORKING AWAY LIKE A BEAVER AND USING THE SHARPENED NAILS INSTEAD OF HIS TEETH
THERE WAS A FIERCE STRUGGLE BUT THE PIRATE WAS QUICK AND POWERFUL AND THE SENTINEL WAS SOON DEAD THEN CARRYING HIS TWO JARS BARTHOLEMY CLIMBED SWIFTLY AND NOISELESSLY UP THE SHORT LADDER
THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD BARTHOLEMY AND THE OTHERS IN CHARGE DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN IMPORTANT CAPTURE HE HAD MADE HE SUPPOSED THAT THESE PIRATES WERE ORDINARY BUCCANEERS AND IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO KEEP THEM AS HIS OWN PRIVATE PRISONERS
HE BECAME SUDDENLY A MODEST PERSON THERE WAS LOW TONED TALK AMONG THE TROOPS THE OFFICERS WERE IMPATIENT AND SNAPPY THEIR COUNTENANCES CLOUDED WITH THE TALES OF MISFORTUNE
THE DAY HAD GROWN MORE WHITE UNTIL THE SUN SHED HIS FULL RADIANCE UPON THE THRONGED FOREST A SORT OF A GUST OF BATTLE CAME SWEEPING TOWARD THAT PART OF THE LINE WHERE LAY THE YOUTH'S REGIMENT THE FRONT SHIFTED A TRIFLE TO MEET IT SQUARELY
THE NOISE OF FIRING DOGGED THEIR FOOTSTEPS SOMETIMES IT SEEMED TO BE DRIVEN A LITTLE WAY BUT IT ALWAYS RETURNED AGAIN WITH INCREASED INSOLENCE THE MEN MUTTERED AND CURSED THROWING BLACK LOOKS IN ITS DIRECTION
AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM WHICH SEEMS A STRANGE FAILING IN A HARDY SAILOR WITH SO MANY OTHER NAUTICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE ROUGH HOLD WHERE HE WAS SHUT UP OUR PIRATE PEERING ABOUT ANXIOUS AND EARNEST
BUT NOW THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO ALTER HIS PLANS THE ORDINARY PERSON IN COMMAND OF TWO SMALL BOATS WHO SHOULD SUDDENLY DISCOVER THAT A VILLAGE WHICH HE SUPPOSED ALMOST DEFENCELESS WAS PROTECTED BY A LARGE MAN OF WAR
BUT STILL STILL WE DON'T HAVE NO LUCK WELL THEN IF WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL AN DON'T EVER WHIP IT MUST BE THE GENERAL'S FAULT SAID THE YOUTH GRANDLY AND DECISIVELY
THIS PART OF THE WORLD LED A STRANGE BATTLEFUL EXISTENCE THE YOUTH'S REGIMENT WAS MARCHED TO RELIEVE A COMMAND THAT HAD LAIN LONG IN SOME DAMP TRENCHES THE MEN TOOK POSITIONS BEHIND A CURVING LINE OF RIFLE PITS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED UP LIKE A LARGE FURROW
THERE WAS A WAIT IN THIS PART OF THE FIELD THERE PASSED SLOWLY THE INTENSE MOMENTS THAT PRECEDE THE TEMPEST A SINGLE RIFLE FLASHED IN A THICKET BEFORE THE REGIMENT IN AN INSTANT IT WAS JOINED BY MANY OTHERS
AND RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD INTO THE DARK WOODS BEYOND THE TOWN BARTHOLEMY WAS NOW GREATLY IN FEAR THAT WHEN HIS ESCAPE WAS DISCOVERED HE WOULD BE TRACKED BY BLOODHOUNDS
THE TROOPS SIFTING THROUGH THE FOREST WERE SULLEN IN THE YOUTH'S COMPANY ONCE A MAN'S LAUGH RANG OUT A DOZEN SOLDIERS TURNED THEIR FACES QUICKLY TOWARD HIM AND FROWNED WITH VAGUE DISPLEASURE
AND HE ALSO DISCOVERED MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE THAT THERE WERE VERY FEW PROVISIONS ON BOARD FOR WHEN THE VESSEL WAS SENT FROM HAVANA IT WAS SUPPOSED SHE WOULD MAKE BUT A VERY SHORT CRUISE
THIS CAME SOON AFTER NIGHTFALL A MAN DESCENDED WITH A LANTERN TO SEE THAT THE PRISONER WAS STILL SECURE LET US HOPE THAT IT WAS NOT THE SOLDIER WHO HAD KINDLY INFORMED HIM OF HIS FATE AND AS SOON AS HE WAS FAIRLY IN THE HOLD BARTHOLEMY SPRANG UPON HIM
AND THAT UNLESS HE WISHED TO BRING UPON THEM TROUBLES GREATER THAN THOSE OF FAMINE OR PESTILENCE THEY BEGGED THAT HE WOULD RETRACT HIS OATH WHEN THE HIGH DIGNITARY HAD COOLED DOWN A LITTLE HE SAW THAT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF SENSE IN WHAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE HAD SAID TO HIM
AND WHO HAD HEARD OF HIS VARIOUS EXPLOITS HE THEREFORE WENT TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE VESSEL AND INFORMED HIM THAT HE HAD ON BOARD ONE OF THE VERY WORST PIRATES IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHOSE WICKED DEEDS WERE WELL KNOWN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WEST INDIES
IT'S OUR LUCK T GIT LICKED OFTEN SAID HIS FRIEND IN A WEARY TONE HE WAS TRUDGING ALONG WITH STOOPED SHOULDERS AND SHIFTING EYES LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CANED AND KICKED WELL DON'T WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL
THE MAN OF WAR WAS ANCHORED NOT VERY FAR FROM THE TOWN AND WHEN ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE WATCH ON DECK SAW SOME CANOES APPROACHING THEY SUPPOSED THEM TO BE BOATS FROM SHORE
GATHERING UP HIS LEGS SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF REACH OF THE ALLIGATORS AND WITH A LONG POLE PUSHED HIMSELF OFF FROM SHORE SOMETIMES PADDLING AND SOMETIMES PUSHING HIS POLE AGAINST THE BOTTOM HE AT LAST GOT ACROSS THE RIVER AND TOOK UP HIS JOURNEY UPON DRY LAND
A SPUTTERING OF MUSKETRY WAS ALWAYS TO BE HEARD LATER THE CANNON HAD ENTERED THE DISPUTE IN THE FOG FILLED AIR THEIR VOICES MADE A THUDDING SOUND THE REVERBERATIONS WERE CONTINUAL
INCREASED TO A LOUD AND JOYOUS BURST AND THEN AS THE SUN WENT SERENELY UP THE SKY THROWING ILLUMINATING RAYS INTO THE GLOOMY THICKETS IT BROKE FORTH INTO PROLONGED PEALINGS THE WOODS BEGAN TO CRACKLE AS IF AFIRE
AND WHO BEGAN TO RUB A CROW BAR ON A STONE IN ORDER TO REDUCE IT TO THE PROPER SIZE BARTHOLEMY CAREFULLY KNOCKED ALL THE NAILS OUT OF THE BOARD AND THEN FINDING A LARGE FLAT STONE HE RUBBED DOWN ONE OF THEM UNTIL HE HAD FORMED IT INTO THE SHAPE OF A RUDE KNIFE BLADE
THIS MAN WHO WAS NOT A SOLDIER WAS DESPERATELY FRIGHTENED AND BEGGED PITEOUSLY FOR HIS LIFE L'OLONNOIS FINDING THAT THE MAN WAS WILLING TO TELL EVERYTHING HE KNEW QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT THE SENDING OF THIS VESSEL FROM HAVANA
SO THAT LARGE SHIPS COULD NOT APPROACH VERY NEAR AND THUS THE VILLAGERS WERE KEPT BUSY CARRYING GOODS AND SUPPLIES IN SMALL BOATS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS FROM THE TOWN TO THE VESSELS AT ANCHOR
NOW A PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAPPENED TO HIM ALTHOUGH TO AN ORDINARY TRAVELLER IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE WHATEVER ON THE EDGE OF THE SHORE WHERE IT HAD FLOATED DOWN FROM SOME REGION HIGHER UP THE RIVER
HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THIS UNWIELDY CONTRIVANCE WOULD SUPPORT HIM IN THE WATER AMONG OTHER THINGS HE HAD FOUND IN HIS RUMMAGINGS ABOUT THE HOLD WAS AN OLD KNIFE AND WITH THIS IN HIS HAND HE NOW SAT WAITING FOR A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK HIS SENTINEL
FOR AS HAS BEEN SAID SUCH VESSELS WERE CONTINUALLY PLYING ABOUT THOSE SHALLOW WATERS THE CANOES WERE HAILED AND AFTER HAVING GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF THEMSELVES THEY WERE ASKED IF THEY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE PIRATE SHIP UPON THE COAST
AWAITED THE MOMENT WHEN THE GRAY SHADOWS OF THE WOODS BEFORE THEM SHOULD BE SLASHED BY THE LINES OF FLAME THERE WAS MUCH GROWLING AND SWEARING GOOD GAWD THE YOUTH GRUMBLED WE'RE ALWAYS BEING CHASED AROUND LIKE RATS IT MAKES ME SICK
FOR A MOMENT HE SANK BELOW THE SURFACE BUT THE TWO AIR TIGHT JARS QUICKLY ROSE AND BORE HIM UP WITH THEM THERE WAS A BUSTLE ON BOARD THE SHIP THERE WAS SOME RANDOM FIRING OF MUSKETS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPLASHING WHICH THE WATCH HAD HEARD
WITH CANNON AND A WELL ARMED CREW WOULD HAVE ALTERED HIS PLANS SO COMPLETELY THAT HE WOULD HAVE LEFT THAT PART OF THE COAST OF CUBA WITH ALL POSSIBLE EXPEDITION BUT THE PIRATES OF THAT DAY SEEMED TO PAY VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE ELEMENT OF ODDS
WHEN THIS DIGNITARY HEARD THE STORY HE IMMEDIATELY SENT A PARTY OF OFFICERS TO THE SHIP AND COMMANDED THE CAPTAIN TO DELIVER THE PIRATE LEADER INTO THEIR CHARGE THE OTHER MEN WERE LEFT WHERE THEY WERE
HE WISHED TO GIVE SPAIN A LESSON WHICH WOULD MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE INTERFERED WITH IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS ENTERPRISES AND HE DETERMINED TO ALLOW HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF PERSONALLY TEACHING THIS LESSON
LESS TALKIN AN MORE FIGHTIN IS WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU BOYS I NEVER SAW SECH GABBLING JACKASSES HE PAUSED READY TO POUNCE UPON ANY MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE THE TEMERITY TO REPLY
ONE CANOE ATTACKING HER ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER ON THE OTHER BEFORE THE SPANISH COULD COMPREHEND WHAT HAD HAPPENED THERE WERE MORE THAN TWENTY PIRATES UPON THEIR DECKS THE DREADED L'OLONNOIS AT THEIR HEAD
AND WHO OUGHT IMMEDIATELY TO BE DELIVERED UP TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES THIS PROPOSAL HOWEVER MET WITH NO FAVOR FROM THE SPANISH CAPTAIN WHO HAD FOUND BARTHOLEMY A VERY QUIET MAN AND COULD SEE THAT HE WAS A VERY STRONG ONE
STORIES OF DISASTER WERE BORNE INTO THEIR MINDS WITH MANY PROOFS THIS DIN OF MUSKETRY ON THE RIGHT GROWING LIKE A RELEASED GENIE OF SOUND EXPRESSED AND EMPHASIZED THE ARMY'S PLIGHT THE MEN WERE DISHEARTENED AND BEGAN TO MUTTER
BUT NONE OF THE BALLS STRUCK THE PIRATE OR HIS JARS AND HE SOON FLOATED OUT OF SIGHT AND HEARING KICKING OUT WITH HIS LEGS AND PADDLING AS WELL AS HE COULD WITH ONE HAND WHILE HE HELD ON TO THE JARS WITH THE OTHER HE AT LAST MANAGED TO REACH THE LAND
BUT WHEN THE INHABITANTS OF HAVANA AND THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES HEARD OF THIS TERRIBLE RESOLUTION OF THEIR GOVERNOR THEY WERE VERY MUCH DISTURBED THEY LIVED IN CONSTANT DANGER OF ATTACK ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WERE ENGAGED IN FISHING OR MARITIME PURSUITS
THE YOUTH NEVERTHELESS FELT A THREAT HIS MIND SHRANK FROM GOING NEAR TO THE DANGER AND THEREAFTER HE WAS SILENT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SARCASTIC MAN'S WORDS TOOK FROM HIM ALL LOUD MOODS THAT WOULD MAKE HIM APPEAR PROMINENT
SAID A MAN HERE WE ARE EVERYBODY FIGHTIN BLOOD AN DESTRUCTION
IN A CLEAR SPACE THE TROOPS WERE AT LAST HALTED REGIMENTS AND BRIGADES BROKEN AND DETACHED THROUGH THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH THICKETS GREW TOGETHER AGAIN AND LINES WERE FACED TOWARD THE PURSUING BARK OF THE ENEMY'S INFANTRY
I DON'T THINK I FOUGHT THE WHOLE BATTLE YESTERDAY BUT THE OTHER SEEMED INNOCENT OF ANY DEEPER MEANING APPARENTLY HE HAD NO INFORMATION IT WAS MERELY HIS HABIT OH HE REPLIED IN THE SAME TONE OF CALM DERISION
BUT NO INTENTION OF GIVING UP HIS PROJECT ENTERED HIS MIND AS THE SPANISH VESSEL WAS IN HIS WAY HE WOULD ATTACK HER AND GET HER OUT OF HIS WAY IF THE THING COULD BE DONE IN THIS NEW STATE OF AFFAIRS HE WAS OBLIGED TO USE STRATAGEM
AND I DON'T SEE ANY SENSE IN FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND FIGHTING YET ALWAYS LOSING THROUGH SOME DERNED OLD LUNKHEAD OF A GENERAL
AND THEY FOUGHT EACH SCOUNDREL OF THEM LIKE THREE MEN AND THE SAVAGE FIGHT ENDED BY EVERY SPANISH SAILOR OR OFFICER WHO WAS NOT KILLED OR WOUNDED BEING FORCED TO STAY BELOW DECKS WHERE THE HATCHES WERE SECURELY FASTENED DOWN UPON THEM
INFORMING THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND THAT THE CRUEL PIRATE L'OLONNOIS WAS IN A SHIP A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THEIR VILLAGE WHICH HE UNDOUBTEDLY INTENDED TO ATTACK WHEN THE GOVERNOR HEARD THIS ASTONISHING TALE
DON'T WE DO ALL THAT MEN CAN DEMANDED THE YOUTH LOUDLY HE WAS SECRETLY DUMFOUNDED AT THIS SENTIMENT WHEN IT CAME FROM HIS LIPS FOR A MOMENT HIS FACE LOST ITS VALOR AND HE LOOKED GUILTILY ABOUT HIM
WHEN HE HAD MADE FOR HIMSELF WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FREE PASSAGE HE WOULD DASH IN AND HURRY ACROSS AT OTHER TIMES GREAT FORESTS STRETCHED DOWN TO THE VERY COAST AND THROUGH THESE HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE HIS WAY
HE MANAGED TO GET POSSESSION OF A SHIP WHICH HE MANNED WITH A CREW OF ABOUT A SCORE OF IMPECUNIOUS DARE DEVILS WHO WERE VERY ANXIOUS TO DO SOMETHING TO MEND THEIR FORTUNES HAVING NOW BECOME VERY FOND OF LAND FIGHTING
HERE WAS A NICE LITTLE PRIZE THAT COULD NOT GET AWAY FROM HIM AND L'OLONNOIS HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE HIS PREPARATIONS TO SEIZE IT AS HE COULD NOT SAIL A SHIP DIRECTLY UP TO THE TOWN
NEVER ONCE SETTING HIS FOOT UPON THE GROUND BY WHICH IS MEANT MUD WATER AND ROOTS BUT SWINGING HIMSELF BY HIS HANDS AND ARMS FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH AS IF HE HAD BEEN A GREAT APE ONLY RESTING OCCASIONALLY DRAWING HIMSELF UPON A STOUT LIMB WHERE HE MIGHT SIT FOR A WHILE AND GET HIS BREATH
AND THIS SIGHT DOUBTLESS ANIMATED HIM VERY MUCH DURING THE FIRST PART OF HIS JOURNEY THE TERRIBLE TRIALS AND HARDSHIPS WHICH BARTHOLEMY EXPERIENCED DURING HIS TRAMP ALONG THE COAST WERE SUCH AS COULD HAVE BEEN ENDURED ONLY BY ONE OF THE STRONGEST AND TOUGHEST OF MEN
THERE WAS A MIGHTY SONG OF CLASHES AND CRASHES THAT WENT SWEEPING THROUGH THE WOODS THE GUNS IN THE REAR AROUSED AND ENRAGED BY SHELLS THAT HAD BEEN THROWN BURR LIKE AT THEM SUDDENLY INVOLVED THEMSELVES IN A HIDEOUS ALTERCATION WITH ANOTHER BAND OF GUNS
L'OLONNOIS NOW STOOD A PROUD VICTOR ON THE DECK OF HIS PRIZE AND BEING A MAN OF PRINCIPLE HE DETERMINED TO LIVE UP TO THE DISTINGUISHED REPUTATION WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD
EVEN IF HE COULD NOT WALK NO ATHLETE OF THE PRESENT DAY NO MATTER IF HE SHOULD BE A MOST ACCOMPLISHED CIRCUS MAN COULD REASONABLY EXPECT TO PERFORM THE FEAT WHICH THIS BOLD PIRATE SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED FOR FIVE OR SIX LEAGUES HE WENT THROUGH THAT MANGROVE FOREST
THIS WAS A WIDE RIVER FLOWING THROUGH THE INLAND COUNTRY INTO THE SEA HE MADE HIS WAY UP THE SHORE OF THIS RIVER FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE BUT IT GREW BUT LITTLE NARROWER AND HE COULD SEE NO CHANCE OF GETTING ACROSS HE COULD NOT SWIM
AND THE ATHLETIC BUCCANEER THOUGHT THAT HE COULD EASILY GET THE BETTER OF WHOEVER MIGHT OPEN THE HATCH BUT THE NEXT ACT IN THIS TRULY MELODRAMATIC PERFORMANCE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL MORE DIFFICULT FOR IN ORDER TO ESCAPE FROM THE SHIP IT WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR BARTHOLEMY TO SWIM TO SHORE
ALTHOUGH HE COULD HEAR THE ROARS AND SCREAMS OF WILD BEASTS ALL ABOUT HIM ANY ONE WHO IS AFRAID TO GO DOWN INTO A DARK CELLAR TO GET SOME APPLES FROM A BARREL AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS CAN HAVE NO IDEA OF THE SORT OF MIND POSSESSED BY BARTHOLEMY PORTUGUEZ
OBSERVED A MAN HIS FRIEND RECENTLY AROUSED WAS STILL VERY DROWSY HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM UNTIL HIS MIND TOOK IN THE MEANING OF THE MOVEMENT THEN HE SIGHED OH WELL I S'POSE WE GOT LICKED
HE DID NOT GO OUT IN SEARCH OF SHIPS BUT DIRECTED HIS VESSEL TO A LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED DE LOS CAYOS ON THE COAST OF CUBA FOR HERE HE THOUGHT WAS A CHANCE FOR A GOOD AND EASY STROKE OF BUSINESS
HE COULD SEE THE LOW LINE OF TRENCHES BUT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE A FEW IDLE FLAGS WERE PERCHED ON THE DIRT HILLS
IN HIS REPLY THE FRIEND'S VOICE WAS STERN A COURSE NOT HE SAID
AND SOMETIMES HE SAW AT NIGHT DISTANT TORCHES WHICH HE WAS SURE WERE CARRIED BY MEN WHO WERE HUNTING FOR HIM BUT AT LAST THE PURSUIT SEEMED TO BE GIVEN UP AND HEARING NO MORE DOGS AND SEEING NO MORE FLICKERING LIGHTS BARTHOLEMY LEFT THE MARSH AND SET OUT ON HIS LONG JOURNEY DOWN THE COAST
IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BELIEVE IT THE GOOD NEWS OF THE DEATH OF L'OLONNOIS HAD COME FROM CAMPEACHY TO HAVANA AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LATTER TOWN ALSO REJOICED GREATLY TO BE NOW TOLD THAT THIS SCOURGE OF THE WEST INDIES WAS ALIVE
YOU'VE BEEN JAWIN LIKE A LOT A OLD HENS
FOR AS THEY WERE ALL VERY ABLE BODIED MEN THEY WOULD BE EXTREMELY USEFUL ON A SHIP BUT WHEN HIS VESSEL WAS SAFELY MOORED AND IT BECAME KNOWN IN THE TOWN THAT HE HAD A COMPANY OF PIRATES ON BOARD
HE REMARKED SADLY THE YOUTH HAD A THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE HANDSOME FOR HIM TO FREELY CONDEMN OTHER MEN HE MADE AN ATTEMPT TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF BUT THE WORDS UPON HIS TONGUE WERE TOO BITTER
WHICH WAS FORTY LEAGUES AWAY BUT WHERE HE HAD REASON TO SUPPOSE HE WOULD FIND SOME FRIENDS WHEN HE CAME OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES HE MOUNTED A SMALL HILL AND LOOKED BACK UPON THE TOWN THE PUBLIC SQUARE WAS LIGHTED AND THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT HE SAW THE GALLOWS WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR HIS EXECUTION
HE PRESENTLY BEGAN A LONG AND INTRICATE DENUNCIATION OF THE COMMANDER OF THE FORCES MEBBE IT WA'N'T ALL HIS FAULT NOT ALL TOGETHER
CUT OFF HIS HEAD LIKEWISE AND HIS BODY WAS TUMBLED INTO THE SEA AFTER THOSE OF HIS COMPANIONS NOW THERE WAS NOT A SPANIARD LEFT ON BOARD THE GREAT SHIP EXCEPT ONE MAN
THE SPEECH PIERCED THE YOUTH INWARDLY HE WAS REDUCED TO AN ABJECT PULP BY THESE CHANCE WORDS HIS LEGS QUAKED PRIVATELY HE CAST A FRIGHTENED GLANCE AT THE SARCASTIC MAN WHY NO HE HASTENED TO SAY IN A CONCILIATING VOICE
CHAPTER THIRTEEN A RESURRECTED PIRATE
THE DISORDERED HURRYING LINES OF THE ENEMY COULD SOMETIMES BE SEEN DOWN THROUGH THE GROVES AND LITTLE FIELDS THEY WERE YELLING SHRILL AND EXULTANT AT THIS SIGHT THE YOUTH FORGOT MANY PERSONAL MATTERS AND BECAME GREATLY ENRAGED HE EXPLODED IN LOUD SENTENCES
BUT HE DID NOT LOSE HEART AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS IRONS WHICH WERE PROBABLY VERY CLUMSY AFFAIRS AT LAST CARING LITTLE HOW MUCH HE SCRATCHED AND TORE HIS SKIN
THE BATTLE ROAR SETTLED TO A ROLLING THUNDER WHICH WAS A SINGLE LONG EXPLOSION IN THE REGIMENT THERE WAS A PECULIAR KIND OF HESITATION DENOTED IN THE ATTITUDES OF THE MEN
BUT AFTER A DIET OF ROOTS SHELLFISH MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY AGREEABLE CHANGE AND THEY GAVE HIM ALL THE STRENGTH AND VIGOR HE NEEDED VERY OFTEN HE FOUND STREAMS AND INLETS WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO FORD
AND HE HAD NO WINE JARS NOW WITH WHICH TO BUOY HIMSELF UP
THAT DID NOT ADMIT OF A DOUBT BUT SHE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT DONE WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE PAIN TO HIM AND ELIZABETH SHE DREW UP PLANS OF ECONOMY SHE MADE EXACT CALCULATIONS AND SHE DID WHAT NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF DOING SHE CONSULTED ANNE
HE SEEMS AN EXCELLENT MAN AND I THINK HIM UNCOMMONLY PLEASING
KELLYNCH HALL AND AFTER A VERY FEW DAYS MORE OF DOUBT AND INDECISION THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS SETTLED AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT THERE HAD BEEN THREE ALTERNATIVES LONDON BATH
AND SO DOES MISTER PALMER TOO I AM SURE THOUGH WE COULD NOT GET HIM TO OWN IT LAST NIGHT MISSUS PALMER'S INFORMATION RESPECTING WILLOUGHBY WAS NOT VERY MATERIAL BUT ANY TESTIMONY IN HIS FAVOUR HOWEVER SMALL WAS PLEASING TO HER
THERE IS STILL MORE DUE TO THE CHARACTER OF AN HONEST MAN
SHE HAD FOUND IN HER EVERY THING THAT COULD TEND TO MAKE A FARTHER CONNECTION BETWEEN THE FAMILIES UNDESIRABLE
WHICH IS A MELANCHOLY AND SHOCKING EXTREMITY IS HER SON DETERMINED TO SUBMIT TO THIS AND TO ALL THE TEDIOUSNESS OF THE MANY YEARS OF SUSPENSE IN WHICH IT MAY INVOLVE YOU RATHER THAN RUN THE RISK OF HER DISPLEASURE FOR A WHILE BY OWNING THE TRUTH
NO PRIDE NO HAUTEUR AND YOUR SISTER JUST THE SAME ALL SWEETNESS AND AFFABILITY ELINOR WISHED TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT LUCY STILL PRESSED HER TO OWN THAT SHE HAD REASON FOR HER HAPPINESS AND ELINOR WAS OBLIGED TO GO ON
EDWARD WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK AND IT WAS TO NOTICE MARIANNE'S ALTERED LOOKS AND EXPRESS HIS FEAR OF HER NOT FINDING LONDON AGREE WITH HER OH DON'T THINK OF ME SHE REPLIED WITH SPIRITED EARNESTNESS
SAID EDWARD WILLING TO SAY ANY THING THAT MIGHT INTRODUCE ANOTHER SUBJECT NOT AT ALL
IT WILL BE QUITE DELIGHTFUL MY LOVE APPLYING TO HER HUSBAND DON'T YOU LONG TO HAVE THE MISS DASHWOODS COME TO CLEVELAND CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WITH A SNEER I CAME INTO DEVONSHIRE WITH NO OTHER VIEW
ELINOR WAS AGAIN OBLIGED TO DECLINE HER INVITATION AND BY CHANGING THE SUBJECT PUT A STOP TO HER ENTREATIES SHE THOUGHT IT PROBABLE THAT AS THEY LIVED IN THE SAME COUNTY
THAT MUST BE RECOMMENDATION ENOUGH TO HER HUSBAND BUT MISSUS JOHN DASHWOOD WOULD NOT MUCH APPROVE OF EDWARD'S GOING INTO ORDERS THEN I RATHER SUSPECT THAT MY INTEREST WOULD DO VERY LITTLE
THE UNDESIRABLENESS OF ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR SIR WALTER WAS CERTAINLY MUCH STRENGTHENED BY ONE PART AND A VERY MATERIAL PART OF THE SCHEME WHICH HAD BEEN HAPPILY ENGRAFTED ON THE BEGINNING HE WAS NOT ONLY TO QUIT HIS HOME
OR ANOTHER HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY
FOR LADY MIDDLETON'S DELIGHTED WITH MISSUS DASHWOOD SO WE SHALL BE A GOOD DEAL IN HARLEY STREET I DARE SAY AND EDWARD SPENDS HALF HIS TIME WITH HIS SISTER BESIDES LADY MIDDLETON AND MISSUS FERRARS WILL VISIT NOW
THEY SHOULD ALWAYS BE GLAD TO SEE ME THEY ARE SUCH CHARMING WOMEN
HER LOVE MADE NO ANSWER AND AFTER SLIGHTLY BOWING TO THE LADIES BEGAN COMPLAINING OF THE WEATHER HOW HORRID ALL THIS IS SAID HE SUCH WEATHER MAKES EVERY THING AND EVERY BODY DISGUSTING
WHOSE INTEREST WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALITY OF SIR WALTER'S RETRENCHING AND WHO WAS PERFECTLY PERSUADED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE WITHOUT A CHANGE OF ABODE
ELINOR WAS VERY ANGRY BUT MARIANNE SEEMED ENTIRELY INSENSIBLE OF THE STING FOR SHE CALMLY REPLIED NOT SO INDEED FOR SERIOUSLY SPEAKING I AM VERY SURE THAT CONSCIENCE ONLY KEPT EDWARD FROM HARLEY STREET
SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PRESENCE OF LUCY NOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME INJUSTICE TOWARDS HERSELF TO DETER HER FROM SAYING THAT SHE WAS HAPPY TO SEE HIM
LUCY HERE LOOKED UP BUT ELINOR WAS CAREFUL IN GUARDING HER COUNTENANCE FROM EVERY EXPRESSION THAT COULD GIVE HER WORDS A SUSPICIOUS TENDENCY EDWARD'S LOVE FOR ME SAID LUCY HAS BEEN PRETTY WELL PUT TO THE TEST BY OUR LONG
BUT IF HE WERE EVER SO MUCH THERE
OR TO ALLOW HER TO DERIVE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM A PREFERENCE ONLY GIVEN HER BECAUSE HER REAL SITUATION WAS UNKNOWN BUT THAT IT WAS SO HAD NOT ONLY BEEN DECLARED BY LUCY'S EYES AT THE TIME BUT WAS DECLARED OVER AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING MORE OPENLY
SHE WANTED IT TO BE PRESCRIBED AND FELT AS A DUTY SHE RATED LADY RUSSELL'S INFLUENCE HIGHLY AND AS TO THE SEVERE DEGREE OF SELF DENIAL WHICH HER OWN CONSCIENCE PROMPTED SHE BELIEVED THERE MIGHT BE LITTLE MORE DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING THEM TO A COMPLETE THAN TO HALF A REFORMATION
THOUGH MARIANNE WAS THEN GIVING THEM THE POWERFUL PROTECTION OF A VERY MAGNIFICENT CONCERTO I WILL HONESTLY TELL YOU OF ONE SCHEME WHICH HAS LATELY COME INTO MY HEAD FOR BRINGING MATTERS TO BEAR
INDEED I AM BOUND TO LET YOU INTO THE SECRET FOR YOU ARE A PARTY CONCERNED
IF YOU COULD BE SUPPOSED TO BE BIASED IN ANY RESPECT BY YOUR OWN FEELINGS YOUR OPINION WOULD NOT BE WORTH HAVING ELINOR THOUGHT IT WISEST TO MAKE NO ANSWER TO THIS
HE SAID IN CONFESSING HIS JUDGEMENT TO BE ENTIRELY ON THAT SIDE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM THAT SIR WALTER COULD MATERIALLY ALTER HIS STYLE OF LIVING
AND NEVER LOOKED AT ME IN A PLEASANT WAY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IF I HAD BEEN TREATED IN THAT FORBIDDING SORT OF WAY
ELINOR WAS PREVENTED FROM MAKING ANY REPLY TO THIS CIVIL TRIUMPH BY THE DOOR'S BEING THROWN OPEN THE SERVANT'S ANNOUNCING MISTER FERRARS AND EDWARD'S IMMEDIATELY WALKING IN
LUCY LOOKED AT ELINOR AGAIN AND WAS SILENT
HOW FEW PEOPLE KNOW WHAT COMFORT IS SIR JOHN IS AS STUPID AS THE WEATHER THE REST OF THE COMPANY SOON DROPT IN I AM AFRAID MISS MARIANNE SAID SIR JOHN
ASKED ELINOR NOT AT ALL I NEVER SAW HIM BUT I FANCY HE IS VERY UNLIKE HIS BROTHER SILLY AND A GREAT COXCOMB A GREAT COXCOMB REPEATED MISS STEELE
NOW MY PLAN IS THAT HE SHOULD TAKE ORDERS AS SOON AS HE CAN AND THEN THROUGH YOUR INTEREST WHICH I AM SURE YOU WOULD BE KIND ENOUGH TO USE OUT OF FRIENDSHIP FOR HIM AND I HOPE OUT OF SOME REGARD TO ME
ELINOR HARDLY KNEW WHETHER TO SMILE OR SIGH AT THIS ASSERTION LUCY WENT ON
YOUR BROTHER MIGHT BE PERSUADED TO GIVE HIM NORLAND LIVING WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS A VERY GOOD ONE AND THE PRESENT INCUMBENT NOT LIKELY TO LIVE A GREAT WHILE THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR US TO MARRY UPON
BUT THE OBJECT OF DISTANT CIVILITY FROM SITUATION MISSUS CLAY WAS IN LADY RUSSELL'S ESTIMATE
PERHAPS BE A LITTLE SOURED BY FINDING LIKE MANY OTHERS OF HIS SEX THAT THROUGH SOME UNACCOUNTABLE BIAS IN FAVOUR OF BEAUTY HE WAS THE HUSBAND OF A VERY SILLY WOMAN BUT SHE KNEW THAT THIS KIND OF BLUNDER WAS TOO COMMON FOR ANY SENSIBLE MAN TO BE LASTINGLY HURT BY IT
TO BE MORE THOROUGHLY GOOD NATURED OR MORE DETERMINED TO BE HAPPY THAN MISSUS PALMER THE STUDIED INDIFFERENCE INSOLENCE AND DISCONTENT OF HER HUSBAND GAVE HER NO PAIN AND WHEN HE SCOLDED OR ABUSED HER SHE WAS HIGHLY DIVERTED
SHE WOULD NOT BE FRIGHTENED FROM PAYING HIM THOSE ATTENTIONS WHICH AS A FRIEND AND ALMOST A RELATION WERE HIS DUE BY THE OBSERVANT EYES OF LUCY THOUGH SHE SOON PERCEIVED THEM TO BE NARROWLY WATCHING HER
WHOSE EAR HAD CAUGHT THOSE WORDS BY A SUDDEN PAUSE IN MARIANNE'S MUSIC
I AM SO GLAD WE ARE GOT ACQUAINTED AT LAST CONTINUED CHARLOTTE AND NOW I HOPE WE SHALL ALWAYS BE GREAT FRIENDS YOU CAN'T THINK HOW MUCH I LONGED TO SEE YOU IT IS SO DELIGHTFUL THAT YOU SHOULD LIVE AT THE COTTAGE NOTHING CAN BE LIKE IT TO BE SURE
ALWAYS OUT OF HUMOUR ELINOR WAS NOT INCLINED AFTER A LITTLE OBSERVATION TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR BEING SO GENUINELY AND UNAFFECTEDLY ILL NATURED OR ILL BRED AS HE WISHED TO APPEAR HIS TEMPER MIGHT
TIS BECAUSE YOU ARE AN INDIFFERENT PERSON SAID LUCY WITH SOME PIQUE AND LAYING A PARTICULAR STRESS ON THOSE WORDS THAT YOUR JUDGMENT MIGHT JUSTLY HAVE SUCH WEIGHT WITH ME
YOU AND I SIR JOHN SAID MISSUS JENNINGS SHOULD NOT STAND UPON SUCH CEREMONY THEN YOU WOULD BE VERY ILL BRED CRIED MISTER PALMER
I ADVISE YOU BY ALL MEANS TO PUT AN END TO YOUR ENGAGEMENT WITH EDWARD FERRARS IT WILL BE MORE FOR THE HAPPINESS OF BOTH OF YOU I SHOULD RESOLVE UPON DOING IT IMMEDIATELY ELINOR BLUSHED FOR THE INSINCERITY OF EDWARD'S FUTURE WIFE
AND I REALLY BELIEVE HE HAS THE MOST DELICATE CONSCIENCE IN THE WORLD THE MOST SCRUPULOUS IN PERFORMING EVERY ENGAGEMENT HOWEVER MINUTE
FOR SHE LOITERED AWAY SEVERAL MINUTES ON THE LANDING PLACE WITH THE MOST HIGH MINDED FORTITUDE BEFORE SHE WENT TO HER SISTER WHEN THAT WAS ONCE DONE HOWEVER IT WAS TIME FOR THE RAPTURES OF EDWARD TO CEASE FOR MARIANNE'S JOY HURRIED HER INTO THE DRAWING ROOM IMMEDIATELY
AND COULD STRUGGLE WITH ANY POVERTY FOR HIM BUT I LOVE HIM TOO WELL TO BE THE SELFISH MEANS OF ROBBING HIM PERHAPS OF ALL THAT HIS MOTHER MIGHT GIVE HIM IF HE MARRIED TO PLEASE HER WE MUST WAIT IT MAY BE FOR MANY YEARS
IT WAS A VERY AWKWARD MOMENT AND THE COUNTENANCE OF EACH SHEWED THAT IT WAS SO THEY ALL LOOKED EXCEEDINGLY FOOLISH AND EDWARD SEEMED TO HAVE AS GREAT AN INCLINATION TO WALK OUT OF THE ROOM AGAIN AS TO ADVANCE FARTHER INTO IT
UPON MY WORD REPLIED ELINOR YOU KNOW MUCH MORE OF THE MATTER THAN I DO IF YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO EXPECT SUCH A MATCH
NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM MY INTENTION THAN TO GIVE YOU SUCH AN IDEA COULD YOU HAVE A MOTIVE FOR THE TRUST THAT WAS NOT HONOURABLE AND FLATTERING TO ME AND YET I DO ASSURE YOU REPLIED LUCY
AND ANCIENT DIGNITY TO SUPPORT IN ANY OTHER PLACE SIR WALTER MIGHT JUDGE FOR HIMSELF AND WOULD BE LOOKED UP TO AS REGULATING THE MODES OF LIFE IN WHATEVER WAY HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO MODEL HIS HOUSEHOLD SIR WALTER WOULD QUIT
TO THIS ELINOR HAD NO ANSWER TO MAKE AND DID NOT ATTEMPT ANY ARE YOU ILL MISS DASHWOOD YOU SEEM LOW YOU DON'T SPEAK SURE YOU AN'T WELL I NEVER WAS IN BETTER HEALTH
AND WHAT DID THE COLONEL SAY
FROM THIS TIME THE SUBJECT WAS NEVER REVIVED BY ELINOR AND WHEN ENTERED ON BY LUCY WHO SELDOM MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY OF INTRODUCING IT AND WAS PARTICULARLY CAREFUL TO INFORM HER CONFIDANTE OF HER HAPPINESS WHENEVER SHE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM EDWARD
LEST THEY MIGHT PROVOKE EACH OTHER TO AN UNSUITABLE INCREASE OF EASE AND UNRESERVE AND WAS EVEN PARTLY DETERMINED NEVER TO MENTION THE SUBJECT AGAIN ANOTHER PAUSE THEREFORE OF MANY MINUTES DURATION SUCCEEDED THIS SPEECH
ELIZABETH HAD BEEN LATELY FORMING AN INTIMACY WHICH SHE WISHED TO SEE INTERRUPTED IT WAS WITH THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER SHEPHERD WHO HAD RETURNED AFTER AN UNPROSPEROUS MARRIAGE TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE WITH THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF TWO CHILDREN
TO DO IT WELL THAT SHE FORCED HERSELF AFTER A MOMENT'S RECOLLECTION TO WELCOME HIM WITH A LOOK AND MANNER THAT WERE ALMOST EASY AND ALMOST OPEN AND ANOTHER STRUGGLE ANOTHER EFFORT STILL IMPROVED THEM
AND OF HER BEING PARTICULARLY DISGUSTED WITH HIS MOTHER TILL THEY WERE MORE IN PRIVATE BUT WHY WERE YOU NOT THERE EDWARD WHY DID YOU NOT COME I WAS ENGAGED ELSEWHERE
IF WE CAN PERSUADE YOUR FATHER TO ALL THIS SAID LADY RUSSELL LOOKING OVER HER PAPER MUCH MAY BE DONE IF HE WILL ADOPT THESE REGULATIONS IN SEVEN YEARS HE WILL BE CLEAR AND I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM AND ELIZABETH
THE VERY CIRCUMSTANCE IN ITS UNPLEASANTEST FORM WHICH THEY WOULD EACH HAVE BEEN MOST ANXIOUS TO AVOID HAD FALLEN ON THEM THEY WERE NOT ONLY ALL THREE TOGETHER BUT WERE TOGETHER WITHOUT THE RELIEF OF ANY OTHER PERSON
ELINOR BLUSHED IN SPITE OF HERSELF LUCY BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED ANGRILY AT HER SISTER A MUTUAL SILENCE TOOK PLACE FOR SOME TIME LUCY FIRST PUT AN END TO IT BY SAYING IN A LOWER TONE
AND UNDER MANY CIRCUMSTANCES IT NATURALLY WOULD DURING A FOUR YEARS ENGAGEMENT
BUT ELINOR HAD MORE TO DO
WHOSE FIRST VIEWS ON THE PROJECTED CHANGE HAD BEEN FOR BATH SIR WALTER AND ELIZABETH WERE INDUCED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD LOSE NEITHER CONSEQUENCE NOR ENJOYMENT BY SETTLING THERE LADY RUSSELL FELT OBLIGED TO OPPOSE HER DEAR ANNE'S KNOWN WISHES
WITH ALMOST EVERY OTHER MAN IN THE WORLD IT WOULD BE AN ALARMING PROSPECT BUT EDWARD'S AFFECTION AND CONSTANCY NOTHING CAN DEPRIVE ME OF I KNOW THAT CONVICTION MUST BE EVERY THING TO YOU AND HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORTED BY THE SAME TRUST IN YOUR'S
ALL THIS THOUGHT ELINOR IS VERY PRETTY BUT IT CAN IMPOSE UPON NEITHER OF US BUT WHAT SAID SHE AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ARE YOUR VIEWS OR HAVE YOU NONE BUT THAT OF WAITING FOR MISSUS FERRARS'S DEATH
RATHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE HER THAN BECAUSE ELIZABETH DESERVED IT SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE THAN OUTWARD ATTENTION NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY AGAINST PREVIOUS INCLINATION
WHILE HER EYES BRIGHTENED AT THE INFORMATION IT WOULD HAVE GAVE ME SUCH PLEASURE TO MEET YOU THERE BUT I DARE SAY YOU WILL GO FOR ALL THAT TO BE SURE YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER WILL ASK YOU TO COME TO THEM
TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH OVER LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT ITS MORE CONVENIENT DISTANCE FROM KELLYNCH ONLY FIFTY MILES AND LADY RUSSELL'S SPENDING SOME PART OF EVERY WINTER THERE AND TO THE VERY GREAT SATISFACTION OF LADY RUSSELL
DON'T PALM ALL YOUR ABUSES OF LANGUAGES UPON ME
BUT TO SEE IT IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS A TRIAL OF FORTITUDE WHICH STRONGER HEADS THAN SIR WALTER'S HAVE FOUND TOO MUCH KELLYNCH HALL WAS TO BE LET THIS HOWEVER WAS A PROFOUND SECRET NOT TO BE BREATHED BEYOND THEIR OWN CIRCLE
AND FROM OUR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS IN LIFE FROM HIS BEING SO MUCH MORE IN THE WORLD THAN ME AND OUR CONTINUAL SEPARATION
TO LIVE NO LONGER WITH THE DECENCIES EVEN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN NO HE WOULD SOONER QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AT ONCE THAN REMAIN IN IT ON SUCH DISGRACEFUL TERMS QUIT KELLYNCH HALL THE HINT WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN UP BY MISTER SHEPHERD
HER MANNERS GAVE SOME RE ASSURANCE TO EDWARD AND HE HAD COURAGE ENOUGH TO SIT DOWN BUT HIS EMBARRASSMENT STILL EXCEEDED THAT OF THE LADIES IN A PROPORTION WHICH THE CASE RENDERED REASONABLE THOUGH HIS SEX MIGHT MAKE IT RARE
AND IT WAS ONLY ON THE SUPPOSITION OF HIS BEING SPONTANEOUSLY SOLICITED BY SOME MOST UNEXCEPTIONABLE APPLICANT ON HIS OWN TERMS AND AS A GREAT FAVOUR THAT HE WOULD LET IT AT ALL HOW QUICK COME THE REASONS FOR APPROVING WHAT WE LIKE
MAMA SAYS HE WAS IN LOVE WITH YOUR SISTER TOO I ASSURE YOU IT WAS A GREAT COMPLIMENT IF HE WAS FOR HE HARDLY EVER FALLS IN LOVE WITH ANY BODY IS MISTER WILLOUGHBY MUCH KNOWN IN YOUR PART OF SOMERSETSHIRE
BUT EVEN THIS ENCOURAGEMENT FAILED FOR HE WOULD GO AND LUCY WHO WOULD HAVE OUTSTAID HIM HAD HIS VISIT LASTED TWO HOURS SOON AFTERWARDS WENT AWAY WHAT CAN BRING HER HERE SO OFTEN SAID MARIANNE ON HER LEAVING THEM
WOULD BE HARDLY LESS PAINFUL THAN OF BOTH AND SO ON THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST OF LADY RUSSELL'S TOO GENTLE REDUCTIONS HOW ANNE'S MORE RIGID REQUISITIONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE LADY RUSSELL'S HAD NO SUCCESS AT ALL
PERHAPS MISS MARIANNE CRIED LUCY EAGER TO TAKE SOME REVENGE ON HER
YOUR CASE IS A VERY UNFORTUNATE ONE YOU SEEM TO ME TO BE SURROUNDED WITH DIFFICULTIES AND YOU WILL HAVE NEED OF ALL YOUR MUTUAL AFFECTION TO SUPPORT YOU UNDER THEM MISTER FERRARS I BELIEVE IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON HIS MOTHER
FOR I WAS SOMEHOW OR OTHER AFRAID I HAD OFFENDED YOU BY WHAT I TOLD YOU THAT MONDAY OFFENDED ME HOW COULD YOU SUPPOSE SO BELIEVE ME AND ELINOR SPOKE IT WITH THE TRUEST SINCERITY
I ASSURE YOU I HEARD OF IT IN MY WAY THROUGH TOWN MY DEAR MISSUS PALMER UPON MY HONOUR I DID I MET COLONEL BRANDON MONDAY MORNING IN BOND STREET JUST BEFORE WE LEFT TOWN AND HE TOLD ME OF IT DIRECTLY YOU SURPRISE ME VERY MUCH
HERSELF THE WIDOW OF ONLY A KNIGHT SHE GAVE THE DIGNITY OF A BARONET ALL ITS DUE AND SIR WALTER INDEPENDENT OF HIS CLAIMS AS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE AN ATTENTIVE NEIGHBOUR
SHE DISLIKED BATH AND DID NOT THINK IT AGREED WITH HER AND BATH WAS TO BE HER HOME SIR WALTER HAD AT FIRST THOUGHT MORE OF LONDON
HER PLEASURE IN SEEING HIM WAS LIKE EVERY OTHER OF HER FEELINGS STRONG IN ITSELF AND STRONGLY SPOKEN SHE MET HIM WITH A HAND THAT WOULD BE TAKEN AND A VOICE THAT EXPRESSED THE AFFECTION OF A SISTER
NO ANSWERED ELINOR WITH A SMILE WHICH CONCEALED VERY AGITATED FEELINGS ON SUCH A SUBJECT I CERTAINLY WILL NOT YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT MY OPINION WOULD HAVE NO WEIGHT WITH YOU UNLESS IT WERE ON THE SIDE OF YOUR WISHES
GOING SO SOON SAID MARIANNE MY DEAR EDWARD THIS MUST NOT BE AND DRAWING HIM A LITTLE ASIDE SHE WHISPERED HER PERSUASION THAT LUCY COULD NOT STAY MUCH LONGER
SHE WAS OF STRICT INTEGRITY HERSELF WITH A DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR BUT SHE WAS AS DESIROUS OF SAVING SIR WALTER'S FEELINGS AS SOLICITOUS FOR THE CREDIT OF THE FAMILY AS ARISTOCRATIC IN HER IDEAS OF WHAT WAS DUE TO THEM AS ANYBODY OF SENSE AND HONESTY COULD WELL BE
I HAVE SEEN HIM FOR EVER IN TOWN
FOR THOSE WHO WILL ACCEPT OF MY LOVE AND ESTEEM MUST SUBMIT TO MY OPEN COMMENDATION THE NATURE OF HER COMMENDATION IN THE PRESENT CASE HOWEVER HAPPENED TO BE PARTICULARLY ILL SUITED TO THE FEELINGS OF TWO THIRDS OF HER AUDITORS AND WAS SO VERY UNEXHILARATING TO EDWARD
THE VISIT OF THE MISS STEELES AT BARTON PARK WAS LENGTHENED FAR BEYOND WHAT THE FIRST INVITATION IMPLIED THEIR FAVOUR INCREASED THEY COULD NOT BE SPARED SIR JOHN WOULD NOT HEAR OF THEIR GOING AND IN SPITE OF THEIR NUMEROUS AND LONG ARRANGED ENGAGEMENTS IN EXETER
IT IS BUT NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER AS WELL AS OURSELVES MARIANNE LOOKED AT HER STEADILY AND SAID
FOR AT HER PARTICULAR DESIRE LADY MIDDLETON SET HER DOWN IN BERKELEY STREET ON THE CHANCE OF SEEING ELINOR ALONE TO TELL HER HOW HAPPY SHE WAS THE CHANCE PROVED A LUCKY ONE
HE IS THE MOST FEARFUL OF GIVING PAIN OF WOUNDING EXPECTATION AND THE MOST INCAPABLE OF BEING SELFISH OF ANY BODY I EVER SAW EDWARD IT IS SO AND I WILL SAY IT
IN SPITE OF ALL THAT LADY RUSSELL WHO THOUGHT IT A FRIENDSHIP QUITE OUT OF PLACE COULD HINT OF CAUTION AND RESERVE LADY RUSSELL INDEED HAD SCARCELY ANY INFLUENCE WITH ELIZABETH AND SEEMED TO LOVE HER
WE SEEM SO BESET WITH DIFFICULTIES ON EVERY SIDE THAT THOUGH IT WOULD MAKE US MISERABLE FOR A TIME WE SHOULD BE HAPPIER PERHAPS IN THE END
I HAVE THE WHIP HAND OF YOU CHARLOTTE LAUGHED HEARTILY TO THINK THAT HER HUSBAND COULD NOT GET RID OF HER AND EXULTINGLY SAID SHE DID NOT CARE HOW CROSS HE WAS TO HER AS THEY MUST LIVE TOGETHER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE
OTHERWISE LONDON WOULD HAVE NO CHARMS FOR ME I HAVE NOT SPIRITS FOR IT ELINOR WAS SOON CALLED TO THE CARD TABLE BY THE CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST RUBBER AND THE CONFIDENTIAL DISCOURSE OF THE TWO LADIES WAS THEREFORE AT AN END
IT WAS TREATED BY THE FORMER WITH CALMNESS AND CAUTION AND DISMISSED AS SOON AS CIVILITY WOULD ALLOW FOR SHE FELT SUCH CONVERSATIONS TO BE AN INDULGENCE WHICH LUCY DID NOT DESERVE AND WHICH WERE DANGEROUS TO HERSELF
WOULD VERY LIKELY SECURE EVERY THING TO ROBERT AND THE IDEA OF THAT FOR EDWARD'S SAKE FRIGHTENS AWAY ALL MY INCLINATION FOR HASTY MEASURES AND FOR YOUR OWN SAKE TOO OR YOU ARE CARRYING YOUR DISINTERESTEDNESS BEYOND REASON
AND WOULD NOT SAY A WORD AND ALMOST EVERY THING THAT WAS SAID PROCEEDED FROM ELINOR
AND HER LIKING ME IS EVERY THING YOU SHAN'T TALK ME OUT OF MY SATISFACTION
I FELT SURE THAT YOU WAS ANGRY WITH ME AND HAVE BEEN QUARRELLING WITH MYSELF EVER SINCE FOR HAVING TOOK SUCH A LIBERTY AS TO TROUBLE YOU WITH MY AFFAIRS BUT I AM VERY GLAD TO FIND IT WAS ONLY MY OWN FANCY AND THAT YOU REALLY DO NOT BLAME ME
MISTER BRANDON WAS VERY WELL I HOPE OH YES QUITE WELL AND SO FULL OF YOUR PRAISES HE DID NOTHING BUT SAY FINE THINGS OF YOU I AM FLATTERED BY HIS COMMENDATION
SAID MISTER PALMER MARIANNE REMAINED PERFECTLY SILENT THOUGH HER COUNTENANCE BETRAYED HER INTEREST IN WHAT WAS SAID IS IT VERY UGLY
I AM GLAD OF IT WITH ALL MY HEART BUT REALLY YOU DID NOT LOOK IT
FOR HIS HEART HAD NOT THE INDIFFERENCE OF LUCY'S NOR COULD HIS CONSCIENCE HAVE QUITE THE EASE OF ELINOR'S LUCY WITH A DEMURE AND SETTLED AIR SEEMED DETERMINED TO MAKE NO CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMFORT OF THE OTHERS
AND THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTIES AT ALL TO WHAT I USED TO THINK
TO WHICH BOTH OF THEM SUBMITTED WITHOUT ANY RELUCTANCE FOR NOTHING HAD BEEN SAID ON EITHER SIDE TO MAKE THEM DISLIKE EACH OTHER LESS THAN THEY HAD DONE BEFORE AND ELINOR SAT DOWN TO THE CARD TABLE WITH THE MELANCHOLY PERSUASION THAT EDWARD WAS NOT ONLY WITHOUT AFFECTION FOR THE PERSON WHO WAS TO BE HIS WIFE
FOR IT IS SO BAD A DAY I WAS AFRAID YOU MIGHT NOT COME WHICH WOULD BE A SHOCKING THING
AND I AM SO GLAD YOUR SISTER IS GOING TO BE WELL MARRIED I HOPE YOU WILL BE A GREAT DEAL AT COMBE MAGNA IT IS A SWEET PLACE BY ALL ACCOUNTS YOU HAVE BEEN LONG ACQUAINTED WITH COLONEL BRANDON HAVE NOT YOU YES
AND IT IS SINGULARITY WHICH OFTEN MAKES THE WORST PART OF OUR SUFFERING AS IT ALWAYS DOES OF OUR CONDUCT I HAVE GREAT HOPE OF PREVAILING WE MUST BE SERIOUS AND DECIDED FOR AFTER ALL THE PERSON WHO HAS CONTRACTED DEBTS MUST PAY THEM
ALL ABOUT IT I ASSURE YOU AND I ADMIRE YOUR TASTE VERY MUCH
AGAIN THEY ALL SAT DOWN AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO ALL WERE SILENT WHILE MARIANNE WAS LOOKING WITH THE MOST SPEAKING TENDERNESS SOMETIMES AT EDWARD AND SOMETIMES AT ELINOR REGRETTING ONLY THAT THEIR DELIGHT IN EACH OTHER SHOULD BE CHECKED BY LUCY'S UNWELCOME PRESENCE
IT WAS A MUCH SAFER PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN IN HIS PREDICAMENT
SIR WALTER COULD NOT HAVE BORNE THE DEGRADATION OF BEING KNOWN TO DESIGN LETTING HIS HOUSE MISTER SHEPHERD HAD ONCE MENTIONED THE WORD ADVERTISE BUT NEVER DARED APPROACH IT AGAIN SIR WALTER SPURNED THE IDEA OF ITS BEING OFFERED IN ANY MANNER
TO COMPREHEND ALL THE DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST HAVE PERPLEXED THE ENGAGEMENT AND RETARDED THE MARRIAGE OF EDWARD AND HERSELF HAD HE BEEN OTHERWISE FREE AND SHE HAD SEEN ALMOST ENOUGH TO BE THANKFUL FOR HER OWN SAKE
A GREAT WHILE EVER SINCE MY SISTER MARRIED HE WAS A PARTICULAR FRIEND OF SIR JOHN'S I BELIEVE SHE ADDED IN A LOW VOICE
EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF HONESTY AGAINST IMPORTANCE SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES A MORE COMPLETE REFORMATION A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF INDIFFERENCE FOR EVERYTHING BUT JUSTICE AND EQUITY
AND THANK HEAVEN YOU ARE WHAT YOU ALWAYS WERE SHE PAUSED NO ONE SPOKE
AND REPLIED THIS COMPLIMENT WOULD EFFECTUALLY FRIGHTEN ME FROM GIVING ANY OPINION ON THE SUBJECT HAD I FORMED ONE IT RAISES MY INFLUENCE MUCH TOO HIGH THE POWER OF DIVIDING TWO PEOPLE SO TENDERLY ATTACHED IS TOO MUCH FOR AN INDIFFERENT PERSON
AND LUCY WAS STILL THE FIRST TO END IT SHALL YOU BE IN TOWN THIS WINTER MISS DASHWOOD SAID SHE WITH ALL HER ACCUSTOMARY COMPLACENCY CERTAINLY NOT I AM SORRY FOR THAT RETURNED THE OTHER
I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE IT OF ALL THINGS THE WESTONS WILL BE WITH US AND IT WILL BE QUITE DELIGHTFUL YOU CANNOT THINK WHAT A SWEET PLACE CLEVELAND IS AND WE ARE SO GAY NOW FOR MISTER PALMER IS ALWAYS GOING ABOUT THE COUNTRY CANVASSING AGAINST THE ELECTION
SHE WAS A BENEVOLENT CHARITABLE GOOD WOMAN AND CAPABLE OF STRONG ATTACHMENTS MOST CORRECT IN HER CONDUCT STRICT IN HER NOTIONS OF DECORUM AND WITH MANNERS THAT WERE HELD A STANDARD OF GOOD BREEDING
BUT THAT HE HAD NOT EVEN THE CHANCE OF BEING TOLERABLY HAPPY IN MARRIAGE WHICH SINCERE AFFECTION ON HER SIDE WOULD HAVE GIVEN FOR SELF INTEREST ALONE COULD INDUCE A WOMAN TO KEEP A MAN TO AN ENGAGEMENT OF WHICH SHE SEEMED SO THOROUGHLY AWARE THAT HE WAS WEARY
AND SO WE BEGAN TALKING OF MY BROTHER AND SISTER AND ONE THING AND ANOTHER AND I SAID TO HIM SO COLONEL THERE IS A NEW FAMILY COME TO BARTON COTTAGE I HEAR
THE MOTIVE WAS TOO COMMON TO BE WONDERED AT
TO OTHERS PERHAPS TO IDLENESS HOW COULD SHE MAKE SUCH NAILS WORK SHE WHO WISHES TO REMAIN VIRTUOUS MUST NOT HAVE PITY ON HER HANDS
TO TELL THE AGE OF ANY HORSE INSPECT THE LOWER JAW OF COURSE THE SIX FRONT TEETH THE TALE WILL TELL AND EVERY DOUBT AND FEAR DISPEL TWO MIDDLE NIPPERS YOU BEHOLD BEFORE THE COLT IS TWO WEEKS OLD
IT WAS HE WHO POSSESSED THE WIT
HE WAS THE LEADER IRON IS AN ENGLISH WORD IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IRONY IS DERIVED FROM IT
SHE BORE ON HER BROW THE SIGN OF THE ANONYMOUS AND THE UNKNOWN
AND CONTINUE EFFECTIVELY BEAUTIFUL EVEN ON THE GROUND MANY YEARS AFTER THEY FALL THE WOOD IS DELICIOUSLY FRAGRANT FINE IN GRAIN AND TEXTURE AND CREAMY YELLOW AS IF FORMED OF CONDENSED SUNBEAMS
HOW WELL THEY SING IN THE WIND AND HOW STRIKINGLY HARMONIOUS AN EFFECT IS MADE BY THE LONG CYLINDRICAL CONES DEPENDING LOOSELY FROM THE ENDS OF THE LONG BRANCHES THE CONES ARE ABOUT FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG AND THREE IN DIAMETER
AND WHEN THE LAST SCENE OF ALL COMES AND DEATH TAKES HIS MASTER IN ITS EMBRACE AND HIS BODY IS LAID AWAY IN THE COLD GROUND
NO TWO ARE ALIKE AND THOUGH THEY TOSS OUT THEIR IMMENSE ARMS IN WHAT MIGHT SEEM EXTRAVAGANT GESTURES THEY NEVER LOSE THEIR EXPRESSION OF SERENE MAJESTY
THE PRIZE AT THE TOP OF A GREASY POLE WHICH IS CONTINUALLY SLIPPING FROM ONE'S GRASP THE ONLY THING A MAN CONTINUES TO SEARCH FOR AFTER HE HAS FOUND IT THE BULL'S EYE ON THE TARGET AT WHICH ALL THE HUMAN RACE ARE SHOOTING
SOMEWHAT DISTURBED BY INTRIGUES BUT STILL RETAINING ON THEIR FACES SOMETHING OF THE SERENITY OF TOIL AND IN THEIR SOULS THAT FLOWER OF HONESTY WHICH SURVIVES THE FIRST FALL IN WOMAN ONE OF THE FOUR WAS CALLED THE YOUNG BECAUSE SHE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THEM
TO ALLOW THE HARD SHELL SEEDS TO BE BEATEN OUT THE CURIOUS LITTLE PINUS ATTENUATA IS FOUND AT AN ELEVATION OF FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND FEET GROWING IN CLOSE GROVES AND BELTS
WHO HAD TAKEN FOR HER NICKNAME THE NAME OF A FLOWER
THE MONEY THAT A MAN HAS HE MAY LOSE IT FLIES AWAY FROM HIM WHEN HE MAY NEED IT MOST MAN'S REPUTATION MAY BE SACRIFICED IN A MOMENT OF ILL CONSIDERED ACTION
BUT MORAINES VANISH LIKE THE GLACIERS THAT MAKE THEM EVERY STORM THAT FALLS UPON THEM WASTES THEM CARRYING AWAY THEIR DECAYING DISINTEGRATING MATERIAL INTO NEW FORMATIONS UNTIL THEY ARE NO LONGER RECOGNIZABLE
EACH ON ITS OWN SIDE THESE BADLY GUARDED SOULS LISTEN HENCE THE FALLS WHICH THEY ACCOMPLISH AND THE STONES WHICH ARE THROWN AT THEM THEY ARE OVERWHELMED WITH SPLENDOR OF ALL THAT IS IMMACULATE AND INACCESSIBLE ALAS
THAT IT WOULD NOT YET HAVE REACHED THEM TO GO A STEP FURTHER IF IN TEN SIXTY SIX THE RESULT OF THE NORMAN CONQUEST HAD BEEN WIRED TO SOME OF THESE STARS THE MESSAGE WOULD STILL BE ON ITS WAY
SILVERING THE NEEDLES AND GILDING THE MASSIVE BOLES AND THE FLOWERY PARK LIKE GROUND INTO A SCENE OF ENCHANTMENT ON THE MOST SUNNY SLOPES THE WHITE FLOWERED FRAGRANT CHAMAEBATIA IS SPREAD LIKE A CARPET
AND ONE WAS CALLED THE OLD THE OLD ONE WAS TWENTY THREE NOT TO CONCEAL ANYTHING THE THREE FIRST WERE MORE EXPERIENCED MORE HEEDLESS AND MORE EMANCIPATED INTO THE TUMULT OF LIFE THAN FANTINE THE BLONDE
BRIGHTENED DURING EARLY SUMMER WITH THE CRIMSON SARCODES THE WILD ROSE
THEY WERE FOUR OSCARS FOR AT THAT EPOCH ARTHURS DID NOT YET EXIST
MONDAY'S CHILD IS FAIR OF FACE TUESDAY'S CHILD IS FULL OF GRACE WEDNESDAY'S CHILD IS MERRY AND GLAD THURSDAY'S CHILD IS SORRY AND SAD FRIDAY'S CHILD IS LOVING AND GIVING
IN EIGHT MINUTES A MESSAGE WOULD GET TO THE SUN AND ALLOWING FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES DELAY ONE COULD SEND A MESSAGE TO THE SUN AND GET AN ANSWER ALL WITHIN TWENTY MINUTES BUT TO REACH ALPHA CENTAURI IT WOULD TAKE THREE YEARS
THE SUGAR FROM WHICH THE COMMON NAME IS DERIVED IS I THINK THE BEST OF SWEETS IT EXUDES FROM THE HEART WOOD WHERE WOUNDS HAVE BEEN MADE BY FOREST FIRES OR THE AX AND FORMS IRREGULAR CRISP
OF ALL THE WORLD'S EIGHTY OR NINETY SPECIES OF PINE TREES THE SUGAR PINE PINUS LAMBERTIANA IS KING SURPASSING ALL OTHERS NOT MERELY IN SIZE BUT IN LORDLY BEAUTY AND MAJESTY
OSCAR ADVANCES OSCAR I SHALL BEHOLD HIM
THAT THE SIERRA FORESTS INDICATE THE EXTENT AND POSITIONS OF ANCIENT MORAINES AS WELL AS THEY DO BELTS OF CLIMATE ONE WILL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN KNOWING THE NUT PINE PINUS SABINIANA
NEVERTHELESS THE LITTLE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL CAN OPEN THEM INDIANS CLIMB THE TREES LIKE BEARS AND BEAT OFF THE CONES OR RECKLESSLY CUT OFF THE MORE FRUITFUL BRANCHES WITH HATCHETS WHILE THE SQUAWS GATHER AND ROAST THEM UNTIL THE SCALES OPEN SUFFICIENTLY
HE HAD HAD A PIECE REJECTED AT THE VAUDEVILLE HE MADE A FEW VERSES NOW AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THIS HE DOUBTED EVERYTHING TO THE LAST DEGREE WHICH IS A VAST FORCE IN THE EYES OF THE WEAK BEING THUS IRONICAL AND BALD
AT THE SAME TIME OUR PARENTS KEEP WRITING TO US PRESSURE ON BOTH SIDES THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED IT SEEMS TO ME LET US DISCUSS THE QUESTION
WHILE FANTINE WAS A GOOD GIRL GOOD SOME ONE WILL EXCLAIM
SELDOM DIVIDING AT ALL EXCEPTING NEAR THE END BUT ANYTHING LIKE A BARE CABLE APPEARANCE IS PREVENTED BY THE SMALL TASSELED BRANCHLETS THAT EXTEND ALL AROUND THEM AND WHEN THESE SUPERB LIMBS SWEEP OUT SYMMETRICALLY ON ALL SIDES
BUT NOT SO DENSELY AS TO PREVENT THE TRAVELER FROM SAUNTERING WHERE HE WILL
A CROWN SIXTY OR SEVENTY FEET WIDE IS FORMED WHICH GRACEFULLY POISED ON THE SUMMIT OF THE NOBLE SHAFT IS A GLORIOUS OBJECT COMMONLY HOWEVER THERE IS A PREPONDERANCE OF LIMBS TOWARD THE EAST
IF FORTUNE DRIVES THE MASTER FORTH AN OUTCAST INTO THE WORLD FRIENDLESS AND HOMELESS THE FAITHFUL DOG ASKS NO HIGHER PRIVILEGE THAN THAT OF ACCOMPANYING HIM TO GUARD HIM AGAINST DANGER TO FIGHT AGAINST HIS ENEMIES
HE WAS DILAPIDATED BUT STILL IN FLOWER HIS YOUTH WHICH WAS PACKING UP FOR DEPARTURE LONG BEFORE ITS TIME BEAT A RETREAT IN GOOD ORDER BURSTING WITH LAUGHTER AND NO ONE SAW ANYTHING BUT FIRE
THE DIFFERENT SPECIES ARE ARRANGED IN ZONES AND SECTIONS WHICH BRINGS THE FOREST AS A WHOLE WITHIN THE COMPREHENSION OF EVERY OBSERVER THESE SPECIES ARE ALWAYS FOUND AS CONTROLLED BY THE CLIMATES OF DIFFERENT ELEVATIONS
AWAY FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE PREVAILING WINDS ALTHOUGH SO UNCONVENTIONAL WHEN FULL GROWN THE SUGAR PINE IS A REMARKABLY PROPER TREE IN YOUTH A STRICT FOLLOWER OF CONIFEROUS FASHIONS
IN THE YOSEMITE REGION IT GROWS AT AN ELEVATION OF FROM THREE THOUSAND TO SEVEN THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA AND ATTAINS MOST PERFECT DEVELOPMENT AT A HEIGHT OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FEET THE LARGEST SPECIMENS ARE COMMONLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FEET HIGH
AT THE AGE OF TEN FANTINE QUITTED THE TOWN AND WENT TO SERVICE WITH SOME FARMERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AT FIFTEEN SHE CAME TO PARIS TO SEEK HER FORTUNE FANTINE WAS BEAUTIFUL AND REMAINED PURE AS LONG AS SHE COULD SHE WAS A LOVELY BLONDE WITH FINE TEETH
WITHOUT TRACING THEIR TRANSITIONAL FORMS DOWN THE RANGE FROM THOSE STILL IN PROCESS OF FORMATION IN SOME PLACES THROUGH THOSE THAT ARE MORE AND MORE ANCIENT AND MORE OBSCURED BY VEGETATION AND ALL KINDS OF POST GLACIAL WEATHERING IT APPEARS THEREFORE
WHAT IF THE JUNGFRAU WERE HUNGRY FAVOURITE HAVING BEEN IN ENGLAND
EVERY ONE HAS SEEN SUCH FACES FOUR SPECIMENS OF HUMANITY TAKEN AT RANDOM NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD NEITHER WISE NOR IGNORANT NEITHER GENIUSES NOR FOOLS HANDSOME WITH THAT CHARMING APRIL WHICH IS CALLED TWENTY YEARS
BEFORE EIGHT WEEKS WILL TWO MORE COME EIGHT MONTHS THE CORNERS CUT THE GUM THE OUTSIDE GROOVES WILL DISAPPEAR FROM MIDDLE TWO IN JUST ONE YEAR IN TWO YEARS FROM THE SECOND PAIR
ELEGANCE WAS SCANDINAVIAN AND CALEDONIAN THE PURE ENGLISH STYLE WAS ONLY TO PREVAIL LATER AND THE FIRST OF THE ARTHURS WELLINGTON HAD BUT JUST WON THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO
BY SOIL AND BY THE COMPARATIVE STRENGTH OF EACH SPECIES IN TAKING AND HOLDING POSSESSION OF THE GROUND AND SO APPRECIABLE ARE THESE RELATIONS THE TRAVELER NEED NEVER BE AT A LOSS IN DETERMINING WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED FEET HIS ELEVATION ABOVE SEA LEVEL BY THE TREES ALONE
THEN THE OLD WOMAN OPENED THE SIDEBOARD AND ATE AND DRANK HAD A MATTRESS WHICH SHE OWNED BROUGHT IN AND INSTALLED HERSELF
THEY ARE FOREVER TALKING ABOUT IT TO US TO ME IN PARTICULAR JUST AS THE OLD WOMEN IN NAPLES CRY TO SAINT JANUARIUS FACCIA GIALLUTA FA O MIRACOLO YELLOW FACE PERFORM THY MIRACLE SO OUR BEAUTIES SAY TO ME INCESSANTLY
THE INTERJECTION SHOWS SURPRISE AS OH HOW PRETTY AH HOW WISE THE WHOLE ARE CALLED NINE PARTS OF SPEECH WHICH READING WRITING SPEAKING TEACH TO TELL THE AGE OF HORSES
AT NINE THE BLACK SPOTS WILL WITHDRAW THE SECOND PAIR AT TEN ARE WHITE ELEVEN FINDS THE CORNERS LIGHT AS TIME GOES ON THE HORSEMEN KNOW THE OVAL TEETH THREE SIDED GROW
AT THE AGE OF SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS IT BEGINS TO BEAR CONES IN WHORLS ON THE MAIN AXIS AND AS THEY NEVER FALL OFF THE TRUNK IS SOON PICTURESQUELY DOTTED WITH THEM BRANCHES ALSO SOON BECOME FRUITFUL
THEIR SLENDER GRAYISH NEEDLES ARE FROM EIGHT TO TWELVE INCHES LONG AND INCLINED TO DROOP CONTRASTING WITH THE RIGID DARK COLORED TRUNK AND BRANCHES NO OTHER TREE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE SO SUBSTANTIAL IN ITS BODY
WAS NOT CALLED THOU BY A SINGLE ONE OF THEM FANTINE WAS ONE OF THOSE BEINGS WHO BLOSSOM SO TO SPEAK FROM THE DREGS OF THE PEOPLE THOUGH SHE HAD EMERGED FROM THE MOST UNFATHOMABLE DEPTHS OF SOCIAL SHADOW
HE WAS RICH HE HAD AN INCOME OF FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS
FOR NOTWITHSTANDING SOME OF THE SPECIES RANGE UPWARD FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET AND ALL PASS ONE ANOTHER MORE OR LESS YET EVEN THOSE SPECIES POSSESSING THE GREATEST VERTICAL RANGE ARE AVAILABLE IN MEASURING THE ELEVATION
AUGUST GO HE MUST RULES FOR RIDING KEEP UP YOUR HEAD AND YOUR HEART YOUR HANDS AND YOUR HEELS KEEP DOWN
THE TREES GROW SO FAR APART THAT NOT ONE TWENTIETH OF THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND IS IN SHADE AT NOON AFTER ADVANCING FIFTEEN OR TWENTY MILES TOWARDS YOSEMITE AND MAKING AN ASCENT OF FROM TWO TO THREE THOUSAND FEET
AND YOUR ELBOWS CLOSE TO YOUR OWN HAPPINESS DEFINED WANTING NOTHING AND KNOWING IT THE MENTAL SUNSHINE OF CONTENT
AFTER A RUNNING FIRE HAS SCORCHED AND KILLED IT THE CONES OPEN AND THE GROUND BENEATH IT IS THEN SOWN BROADCAST WITH ALL THE SEEDS RIPENED DURING ITS WHOLE LIFE
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRONE TO FALL ON THEIR KNEES AND DO US HONOR WHEN SUCCESS IS WITH US MAY BE THE FIRST TO THROW THE STONE OF MALICE WHEN FAILURE SETTLES ITS CLOUD UPON OUR HEAD
IT IS EXCEEDINGLY SLENDER AND GRACEFUL ALTHOUGH TREES THAT CHANCE TO STAND ALONE SEND OUT VERY LONG CURVED BRANCHES MAKING A STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE ORDINARY GROVE FORM
THE LAST BLACHEVELLE OF MONTAUBAN NATURALLY EACH OF THEM HAD HIS MISTRESS BLACHEVELLE LOVED FAVOURITE SO NAMED BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN IN ENGLAND
PURPLISH BROWN IN COLOR AND USUALLY ENLIVENED WITH TUFTS OF A YELLOW LICHEN TOWARD THE HEAD OF THIS MAGNIFICENT COLUMN LONG BRANCHES SWEEP GRACEFULLY OUTWARD AND DOWNWARD SOMETIMES FORMING A PALM LIKE CROWN
THE DEEP BLACK SPOTS WILL PASS FROM VIEW AT SIX YEARS FROM THE MIDDLE TWO THE SECOND PAIR AT SEVEN YEARS AT EIGHT THE SPOT EACH CORNER CLEARS FROM MIDDLE NIPPERS UPPER JAW
HAD ONE DAY SEEN A CHAMBERMAID'S GOWN CATCH ON A FENDER HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS ACCIDENT
BIRTHDAYS MONDAY FOR HEALTH TUESDAY FOR WEALTH WEDNESDAY BEST OF ALL THURSDAY FOR CROSSES FRIDAY FOR LOSSES SATURDAY NO LUCK AT ALL THE LINES REFER TO THE DAYS OF THE WEEK AS BIRTHDAYS
THESE PARISIANS CAME
WHO WAS STILL IN HER FIRST ILLUSIONS DAHLIA ZEPHINE AND ESPECIALLY FAVOURITE COULD NOT HAVE SAID AS MUCH THERE HAD ALREADY BEEN MORE THAN ONE EPISODE IN THEIR ROMANCE THOUGH HARDLY BEGUN
HAD TURNED OUT TO BE ALPHONSE IN THE SECOND AND GUSTAVE IN THE THIRD POVERTY AND COQUETRY ARE TWO FATAL COUNSELLORS ONE SCOLDS AND THE OTHER FLATTERS AND THE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS OF THE PEOPLE HAVE BOTH OF THEM WHISPERING IN THEIR EAR
IN THREE THE CORNERS TOO ARE BARE AT TWO THE MIDDLE NIPPERS DROP AT THREE THE SECOND PAIR CAN'T STOP WHEN FOUR YEARS OLD THE THIRD PAIR GOES AT FIVE A FULL NEW SET HE SHOWS
WHICH SWEEP UP TO THE FEET OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS IN A DWARFED FRINGE TO A HEIGHT OF FROM TEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND FEET THAT THIS GENERAL ORDER OF DISTRIBUTION DEPENDS ON CLIMATE AS AFFECTED BY HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA IS SEEN AT ONCE
THEY LONGER GET PROJECT BEFORE TILL TWENTY WHEN WE KNOW NO MORE BEES A SWARM OF BEES IN MAY IS WORTH A LOAD OF HAY A SWARM OF BEES IN JUNE IS WORTH A SILVER SPOON
A MAN'S DOG STANDS BY HIM IN PROSPERITY AND POVERTY IN HEALTH AND IN SICKNESS HE WILL SLEEP ON THE COLD GROUND WHEN THE WINTRY WINDS BLOW AND THE SNOW DRIVES FIERCELY IF ONLY HE MAY BE NEAR HIS MASTER'S SIDE
WHICH MANY CHASE BUT FEW CAN TAKE THE INTEREST WE RECEIVE FROM CAPITAL INVESTED IN GOOD WORKS THE BIRTHRIGHT OF CONTENTMENT A TREASURE WHICH WE SEARCH FOR FAR AND WIDE
HIS SON AND DAUGHTER THAT HE HAS REARED WITH LOVING CARE MAY BECOME UNGRATEFUL THOSE WHO ARE NEAREST AND DEAREST TO US THOSE WHOM WE TRUST WITH OUR HAPPINESS AND OUR GOOD NAME MAY BECOME TRAITORS TO THEIR FAITH
THE DOUGLAS SPRUCE LIBOCEDRUS SEQUOIA AND THE SILVER FIR ARE ALSO MORE OR LESS ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT ON MANY DEEP SOILED MOUNTAIN SIDES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
SHE RECEIVED THE NAME AS SHE RECEIVED THE WATER FROM THE CLOUDS UPON HER BROW WHEN IT RAINED SHE WAS CALLED LITTLE FANTINE NO ONE KNEW MORE THAN THAT THIS HUMAN CREATURE HAD ENTERED LIFE IN JUST THIS WAY
SHE HAD NO FAMILY NO BAPTISMAL NAME THE CHURCH NO LONGER EXISTED SHE BORE THE NAME WHICH PLEASED THE FIRST RANDOM PASSER BY WHO HAD ENCOUNTERED HER WHEN A VERY SMALL CHILD RUNNING BARE LEGGED IN THE STREET
STILL SWEET AND FRESH IN EVERY FIBER THE TRUNK IS A REMARKABLY SMOOTH ROUND DELICATELY TAPERED SHAFT STRAIGHT AND REGULAR AS IF TURNED IN A LATHE MOSTLY WITHOUT LIMBS
SATURDAY'S CHILD MUST WORK FOR ITS LIVING WHILE THE CHILD THAT IS BORN ON THE SABBATH DAY IS BLITHE AND BONNY AND GOOD AND GAY SHORT GRAMMAR
CANDY LIKE KERNELS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE SOMETHING LIKE CLUSTERS OF RESIN BEADS WHEN FRESH IT IS WHITE BUT BECAUSE MOST OF THE WOUNDS ON WHICH IT IS FOUND HAVE BEEN MADE BY FIRE
SHE HAD HAD AN ESTABLISHMENT OF HER OWN VERY EARLY IN LIFE HER FATHER WAS AN OLD UNMARRIED PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS A BRUTAL MAN AND A BRAGGART WHO WENT OUT TO GIVE LESSONS IN SPITE OF HIS AGE THIS PROFESSOR WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG MAN
THE ONE ABSOLUTELY UNSELFISH FRIEND A MAN MAY HAVE IN THIS SELFISH WORLD THE ONE THAT NEVER DESERTS HIM THE ONE THAT NEVER PROVES UNGRATEFUL OR TREACHEROUS IS THE DOG GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY
SHE HAD GOLD AND PEARLS FOR HER DOWRY BUT HER GOLD WAS ON HER HEAD AND HER PEARLS WERE IN HER MOUTH SHE WORKED FOR HER LIVING THEN STILL FOR THE SAKE OF HER LIVING FOR THE HEART ALSO HAS ITS HUNGER SHE LOVED
ITS MOST CONSTANT COMPANION IS THE YELLOW PINE
GREEN SHADED WITH DARK PURPLE ON THEIR SUNWARD SIDES THEY ARE RIPE IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER OF THE SECOND YEAR FROM THE FLOWER
THE CEDAR OF LEBANON SAID SIR JOSEPH HOOKER OCCURS UPON ONE OF THE MORAINES OF AN ANCIENT GLACIER ALL THE FORESTS OF THE SIERRA ARE GROWING UPON MORAINES
THAT A VAST AND ENTHUSIASTIC GRIN BROKE OUT UPON THE FOUR MOUTHS SIMULTANEOUSLY AND BLACHEVELLE EXCLAIMED THAT IS AN IDEA
AND FROM SIX TO EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND THOUGH SOME GRAND OLD PATRIARCH MAY BE MET HERE AND THERE THAT HAS ENJOYED SIX OR EIGHT CENTURIES OF STORMS AND ATTAINED A THICKNESS OF TEN OR EVEN TWELVE FEET
AND OUT SPREAD IN CHARMING VARIETY THE KEY TO THESE STRIKING ARRANGEMENTS IS THE SYSTEM OF ANCIENT GLACIERS WHERE THEY FLOWED THE TREES FOLLOWED TRACING THEIR COURSES ALONG THE SIDES OF CANYONS OVER RIDGES AND HIGH PLATEAUS
WHO CAN SAY SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN FATHER OR MOTHER SHE WAS CALLED FANTINE WHY FANTINE SHE HAD NEVER BORNE ANY OTHER NAME AT THE EPOCH OF HER BIRTH THE DIRECTORY STILL EXISTED SHE HAD NO FAMILY NAME
THE GOAL ERECTED FOR THE HUMAN RACE WHICH FEW REACH BEING TOO HEAVILY HANDICAPPED A WAYSIDE FLOWER GROWING ONLY BY THE PATH OF DUTY A BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLY
THREE LITTLE WORDS YOU OFTEN SEE ARE ARTICLES A AN AND THE A NOUN'S THE NAME OF ANY THING AS SCHOOL OR GARDEN HOOP OR SWING ADJECTIVES TELL THE KIND OF NOUN
NOBLE AS THESE ARE THE SUGAR PINE IS EASILY KING AND SPREADS HIS ARMS ABOVE THEM IN BLESSING WHILE THEY ROCK AND WAVE IN SIGN OF RECOGNITION THE MAIN BRANCHES ARE SOMETIMES FORTY FEET LONG YET PERSISTENTLY SIMPLE
WOULD BECOME INVISIBLE MIZAR THE MIDDLE STAR IN THE TAIL OF THE GREAT BEAR IS FORTY TIMES AS HEAVY AS THE SUN TO THE NAKED EYE THERE ARE FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND OF THESE HEAVENLY BODIES VISIBLE
SENATOR VEST'S EULOGY ON THE DOG GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY THE BEST FRIEND A MAN HAS IN THIS WORLD MAY TURN AGAINST HIM AND BECOME HIS ENEMY
THE AVERAGE SIZE OF THE TREE IS ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET IN HEIGHT AND TWELVE TO FOURTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER THE CONES ARE ABOUT FOUR INCHES LONG AND COVERED WITH A SORT OF VARNISH AND GUM RENDERING THEM IMPERVIOUS TO MOISTURE
HE WAS WRINKLED AND TOOTHLESS AND HE HAD THE BEGINNING OF A BALD SPOT OF WHICH HE HIMSELF SAID WITH SADNESS THE SKULL AT THIRTY THE KNEE AT FORTY HIS DIGESTION WAS MEDIOCRE AND HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY A WATERING IN ONE EYE
THE STARS THOUGH APPEARING SMALL TO US BECAUSE OF THEIR IMMENSE DISTANCE ARE IN REALITY GREAT AND SHINING SUNS IF WE WERE TO ESCAPE FROM THE EARTH INTO SPACE THE MOON JUPITER SATURN AND EVENTUALLY THE SUN
NO TREE LOVER WILL EVER FORGET HIS FIRST MEETING WITH THE SUGAR PINE IN MOST PINE TREES THERE IS THE SAMENESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH TO MOST PEOPLE IS APT TO BECOME MONOTONOUS
AS GREAT SMALL PRETTY WHITE OR BROWN INSTEAD OF NOUNS THE PRONOUNS STAND HIS HEAD HER FACE YOUR ARM MY HAND VERBS TELL SOMETHING TO BE DONE TO READ
HOW THINGS ARE DONE THE ADVERBS TELL AS SLOWLY QUICKLY ILL OR WELL CONJUNCTIONS JOIN THE WORDS TOGETHER AS MEN AND WOMEN WIND OR WEATHER THE PREPOSITION STANDS BEFORE THE NOUN AS IN OR THROUGH THE DOOR
AN AMOUR FOR HIM PASSION FOR HER THE STREETS OF THE LATIN QUARTER FILLED WITH THRONGS OF STUDENTS AND GRISETTES SAW THE BEGINNING OF THEIR DREAM
SOLOMON WOULD REPLY THAT LOVE FORMS A PART OF WISDOM WE WILL CONFINE OURSELVES TO SAYING THAT THE LOVE OF FANTINE WAS A FIRST LOVE A SOLE LOVE A FAITHFUL LOVE SHE ALONE OF ALL THE FOUR
A SWARM OF BEES IN JULY IS NOT WORTH A FLY THE CUCKOO MAY SINGS ALL THE DAY JUNE CHANGES HIS TUNE JULY PREPARES TO FLY
ITS LOWER ABOUT FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED FEET IT IS REMARKABLE FOR ITS LOOSE AIRY WIDE BRANCHING HABIT AND THIN GRAY FOLIAGE FULL GROWN SPECIMENS ARE FROM FORTY TO FIFTY FEET IN HEIGHT
SLIM ERECT WITH LEAFY BRANCHES KEPT EXACTLY IN PLACE EACH TAPERING IN OUTLINE AND TERMINATING IN A SPIRY POINT THE SUCCESSIVE FORMS BETWEEN THE CAUTIOUS NEATNESS OF YOUTH AND THE BOLD FREEDOM OF MATURITY
THE FOLIAGE IS OF THE SAME PECULIAR GRAY GREEN COLOR AS THAT OF THE NUT PINE AND IS WORN ABOUT AS LOOSELY SO THAT THE BODY OF THE TREE IS SCARCELY OBSCURED BY IT
THEY ARE THE PRIESTS OF PINES AND SEEM EVER TO BE ADDRESSING THE SURROUNDING FOREST THE YELLOW PINE IS FOUND GROWING WITH THEM ON WARM HILLSIDES AND THE SILVER FIR ON COOL NORTHERN SLOPES BUT
AFTER MAKING ALL DUE ALLOWANCES FOR THESE LITTLE IRREGULAR HOUSEHOLDS
THE FOREST TREES IN GENERAL FOR THE USE OF THE EVER INCREASING NUMBER OF YOSEMITE VISITORS WHO MAKE EXTENSIVE EXCURSIONS INTO THE MOUNTAINS BEYOND THE VALLEY A SKETCH OF THE FOREST TREES IN GENERAL WILL PROBABLY BE FOUND USEFUL
REMAINED HOURS WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD BREAKFASTED DINED AND SUPPED FOR FOUR AND WENT DOWN TO THE PORTER'S QUARTERS FOR COMPANY WHERE SHE SPOKE ILL OF HER DAUGHTER
FANTINE DAHLIA ZEPHINE AND FAVOURITE HAVE BEEN TEASING US FOR NEARLY A YEAR TO GIVE THEM A SURPRISE
OFFER A DELIGHTFUL STUDY AT THE AGE OF FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS THE SHY FASHIONABLE FORM BEGINS TO BE BROKEN UP
WHEN ALL OTHER FRIENDS DESERT HE REMAINS WHEN RICHES TAKE WINGS AND REPUTATION FALLS TO PIECES HE IS AS CONSTANT IN HIS LOVE AS THE SUN IN ITS JOURNEY THROUGH THE HEAVENS
HE WILL KISS THE HAND THAT HAS NO FOOD TO OFFER HE WILL LICK THE WOUNDS AND SORES THAT COME IN ENCOUNTER WITH THE ROUGHNESS OF THE WORLD HE GUARDS THE SLEEP OF HIS PAUPER MASTER AS IF HE WERE A PRINCE
THE SAP IS STAINED AND THE HARDENED SUGAR BECOMES BROWN INDIANS ARE FOND OF IT BUT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS LAXATIVE PROPERTIES ONLY SMALL QUANTITIES MAY BE EATEN
AND AS THIS IS THE NEAREST OF THE STARS WHAT TIME MUST IT TAKE TO GET TO THE OTHERS IF WHEN WELLINGTON WON THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN THE NEWS HAD BEEN TELEGRAPHED OFF IMMEDIATELY THERE ARE SOME STARS SO REMOTE
IT FORMS THE BULK OF THE FOREST FILLING EVERY SWELL AND HOLLOW AND DOWN PLUNGING RAVINE THE MAJESTIC CROWNS APPROACHING EACH OTHER IN BOLD CURVES MAKE A GLORIOUS CANOPY THROUGH WHICH THE TEMPERED SUNBEAMS POUR
TO THE EASTWARD YOU GAZE FAR OUT OVER THE DESERT PLAINS AND MOUNTAINS OF THE GREAT BASIN RANGE BEYOND RANGE EXTENDING WITH SOFT OUTLINES BLUE AND PURPLE IN THE DISTANCE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND FEET BELOW YOU LIES LAKE MONO
THE HIGHEST OF WHICH ARE THE GLACIERS THAT LIE ON THE NORTH SIDES OF MOUNT LYELL AND MOUNT MC CLURE
THENCE PUSH ON PAST TENAYA LAKE INTO THE TUOLUMNE MEADOWS AND ESTABLISH A CENTRAL CAMP NEAR THE SODA SPRINGS FROM WHICH GLORIOUS EXCURSIONS CAN BE MADE AT YOUR LEISURE
EVENING CAME ON JUST AS I GOT FAIRLY INTO THE MAIN CANYON IT IS ABOUT A MILE WIDE AND A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO MILES LONG
GILIAS PHLOXES MIMULUS ET CETERA MANY OF THEM WITH MORE PETALS THAN LEAVES ON THE BORDERS OF LITTLE STREAMS LARGER PLANTS FLOURISH LUPINES DAISIES ASTERS GOLDENRODS
STUDYING THE TREMENDOUS TOPOGRAPHY ET CETERA TRACE THE RIM OF THE VALLEY TO THE GRAND EL CAPITAN RIDGE AND GO DOWN TO ITS BROW WHERE YOU WILL GAIN EVERLASTING IMPRESSIONS OF NATURE'S STEADFASTNESS AND POWER
DRINKING THE THIN SUNSHINE AND MATURING THEIR FINE PURPLE CONES AS IF THEY MEANT TO LIVE FOREVER THE GENERAL VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND SUBLIME TO BE FOUND IN ALL THE RANGE
PRESSED SO FLAT BY THE TEN OR TWENTY FEET OF SNOW PILED UPON THEM EVERY WINTER FOR CENTURIES THAT YOU MAY WALK OVER THEM AS IF WALKING ON A SHAGGY RUG
THE TOP OF LIBERTY CAP VERNAL FALL AND THE WILD BOULDER CHOKED RIVER CANYON THE TRAIL LEAVES THE VALLEY AT THE BASE OF THE SENTINEL ROCK
WITH A SLOPE OF ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT DEGREES CLIMBING TO THE TOP OF IT I DISCOVERED A VERY SMALL BUT WELL CHARACTERIZED GLACIER SWOOPING DOWN FROM THE SHADOWY CLIFFS OF THE MOUNTAIN TO ITS TERMINAL MORAINE
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE MOUNTAIN GO FAR ENOUGH DOWN THE NORTH SIDE FOR A VIEW OF THE DANA GLACIER
SOMETHING LIKE THE MUD CORN FROM A GRINDSTONE THIS SUGGESTED ITS GLACIAL ORIGIN FOR THE STREAM THAT WAS CARRYING IT ISSUED FROM A RAW LOOKING MORAINE THAT SEEMED TO BE IN PROCESS OF FORMATION
ANOTHER GRAND TWO DAY EXCURSION IS THE SAME AS THE FIRST OF THE ONE DAY TRIPS AS FAR AS THE HEAD OF ILLILOUETTE FALL
THE ICE APPEARED ON ALL THE LOWER PORTION OF THE GLACIER FARTHER UP IT WAS COVERED WITH SNOW
FOR A TWO DAY TRIP I WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO MOUNT HOFFMAN SPEND THE NIGHT ON THE SUMMIT NEXT MORNING GO DOWN BY MAY LAKE TO TENAYA LAKE AND RETURN TO THE VALLEY BY CLOUD'S REST AND THE NEVADA AND VERNAL FALLS
SOUTHEASTWARD THE STARR KING
BUT PERHAPS NONE OF THEM WILL BE REMEMBERED WITH KEENER DELIGHT THAN THE DAYS SPENT IN SAUNTERING ON THE BROAD VELVET LAWNS BY THE RIVER SHARING THE SKY WITH THE MOUNTAINS AND TREES GAINING SOMETHING OF THEIR STRENGTH AND PEACE
YOU SAUNTER AMONG THE CRYSTALS AND FLOWERS AS IF YOU WERE WALKING AMONG STARS FROM THE SUMMIT NEARLY ALL THE YOSEMITE PARK IS DISPLAYED LIKE A MAP
AND FOLLOW THE DIVIDE TO CLOUDS REST AFTER A GLORIOUS VIEW FROM THE CREST OF THIS LOFTY GRANITE WAVE YOU WILL FIND A TRAIL ON ITS WESTERN END THAT WILL LEAD YOU DOWN PAST NEVADA AND VERNAL FALLS
BUT FOR MILES AND MILES IT IS SO SMOOTH AND LEVEL THAT A HUNDRED HORSEMEN MAY RIDE ABREAST OVER IT THE MAIN LOWER PORTION OF THE MEADOWS IS ABOUT FOUR MILES LONG AND FROM A QUARTER TO HALF A MILE WIDE
CATHEDRAL SPIRES UNICORN PEAK AND A SERIES OF ORNAMENTAL NAMELESS COMPANIONS RISING IN STRIKING FORMS AND NEARNESS ABOVE A DENSE FOREST GROWING ON THE LEFT
AND PATCHES OF BRYANTHUS CASSIOPE AND ARCTIC WILLOWS BEGIN TO APPEAR THE SMALL LAKES WHICH A FEW MILES DOWN THE VALLEY ARE SO RICHLY BORDERED WITH FLOWERY MEADOWS
AT LEAST AS FAR AS THE FOOT OF THE WONDERFUL SERIES OF RIVER CATARACTS ALL OF THESE EXCURSIONS ARE SURE TO BE MADE MEMORABLE WITH JOYFUL HEALTH GIVING EXPERIENCES
ALL ALONG THE MEADOWS AND ONE MAY MOVE FROM GROVE TO GROVE EVERY DAY ALL SUMMER ENJOYING NEW HOMES AND NEW BEAUTY TO SATISFY EVERY ROVING DESIRE FOR CHANGE
CLUMPS OF DWARF PINE AND MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK WILL FURNISH RESIN ROOTS AND BRANCHES FOR FUEL AND LIGHT AND THE RILLS SPARKLING WATER
BUT ON THE EAST A GENTLE ICE BURNISHED JUNIPER DOTTED SLOPE EXTENDS TO THE SUMMIT WHERE OTHER WONDERFUL VIEWS ARE DISPLAYED WHERE ALL ARE WONDERFUL THE SOUTH SIDE AND SHOULDERS OF HALF DOME AND CLOUDS REST
NO MOUNTAIN TOP COULD BE BETTER PLACED FOR THIS MOST GLORIOUS OF MOUNTAIN VIEWS TO WATCH AND SEE THE DEEPENING COLORS OF THE DAWN AND THE SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE SNOWY HIGH SIERRA PASSES
ALL YOUR BODY AGLOW NERVE CURRENTS FLASHING THROUGH YOU NEVER BEFORE FELT GO TO THE TOP OF THE LIBERTY CAP ONLY A GLAD SAUNTER NOW THAT YOUR LEGS AS WELL AS HEAD AND HEART ARE AWAKE
THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE YOSEMITE VALLEY AND ITS MANY DOMES THE STARR KING CLUSTER OF DOMES SENTINEL DOME GLACIER POINT AND PERHAPS THE MOST TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSIVE OF ALL
TEN MILES IN DIAMETER FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AND FOURTEEN FROM WEST TO EAST LYING BARE IN THE TREELESS DESERT LIKE A DISK OF BURNISHED METAL THOUGH AT TIMES IT IS SWEPT BY MOUNTAIN STORM WINDS AND STREAKED WITH FOAM
FROM MOUNTAIN TO MOUNTAIN SHUTS IT IN ON THE EAST MY CAMP WAS ON THE BRINK OF ONE OF THE LAKES IN A THICKET OF MOUNTAIN HEMLOCK PARTLY SHELTERED FROM THE WIND
SWEEPING IN BEAUTIFUL CURVES FROM THE HOLLOWS AND CANYONS
AND ITS DEEPLY SCULPTURED FOUNTAIN PEAKS CALLED
THAT ARE FROM TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OLD STILL HOLDING BRAVELY TO LIFE MAKING THE MOST OF THEIR SLENDER SUMMERS SHAKING THEIR TASSELED NEEDLES IN THE BREEZE RIGHT CHEERILY
AND HUNDREDS OF SMOOTH ROCK WAVES THAT APPEAR TO BE COMING ROLLING ON TOWARDS YOU LIKE HIGH HEAVING WAVES READY TO BREAK
AND THOSE OF THE YOSEMITE ROCKS ESPECIALLY THE HALF DOME AND THE UPPER PART OF THE NORTH WALL ARE VERY FINE BUT OF COURSE FAR THE MOST IMPOSING VIEW IS THE VAST ARRAY OF SNOWY PEAKS ALONG THE AXIS OF THE RANGE
AWAKENING THE LAKES AND CRYSTALS
GRADUALLY ASCENDING OTHER MOUNTAINS COME IN SIGHT PEAK RISING ABOVE PEAK WITH THEIR SNOW AND ICE IN ENDLESS VARIETY OF GROUPING AND SCULPTURE NOW YOUR ATTENTION IS TURNED TO THE MORAINES
IT IS ALSO THE MOST ACCESSIBLE IT IS IN THE HEART OF THE HIGH SIERRA EAST OF YOSEMITE
CROSSING OF BUDD CREEK WHERE YOU WILL FIND THE SUNRISE TRAIL BRANCHING OFF UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THROUGH THE FOREST IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION PAST THE WEST SIDE OF CATHEDRAL PEAK
THE FIRST OF THE SIXTY FIVE THAT I DISCOVERED IN THE SIERRA GLACIAL PHENOMENA IN THE ILLILOUETTE BASIN ARE ON THE GRANDEST SCALE AND IN THE COURSE OF MY EXPLORATIONS I FOUND
WITH YOUR HEART AGLOW SPANGLING LAKE TENAYA AND LAKE MAY WILL BECKON YOU AWAY FOR WALKS ON THEIR ICE BURNISHED SHORES LEAVE TENAYA AT THE WEST END CROSS TO THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE OUTLET
THE GRAY PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL RANGE BOUNDS IT ON THE SOUTH A SIMILAR RANGE OR SPUR THE HIGHEST PEAK OF WHICH IS MOUNT CONNESS ON THE NORTH THE NOBLE MOUNTS DANA GIBBS MAMMOTH LYELL
MAGNIFICENT VIEWS ARE OBTAINED AS YOU APPROACH IT AND PASS THROUGH ITS SPRAY THOUGH WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST YOU WILL BE WELL DRENCHED FROM THE FOOT OF THE FALL THE TRAIL ZIGZAGS UP A NARROW CANYON
TO ANY ONE NOT DESPERATELY TIME POOR THIS TRIP SHOULD HAVE FOUR DAYS INSTEAD OF THREE CAMPING THE SECOND NIGHT AT THE SODA SPRINGS
THE BEST THREE DAY EXCURSION AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IS THE SAME AS THE FIRST OF THE TWO DAY TRIPS UNTIL YOU REACH LAKE TENAYA
THE VIEWS OF THE HOPPER SHAPED CANYON OF THE RIVER FROM THE HEAD OF THE NEVADA FALL TO THE HEAD OF THE VALLEY RETURNING TO THE TRAIL YOU DESCEND BETWEEN THE NEVADA FALL
BACK TO THE WIDE TRANQUIL VALLEY
A DISTANCE OF ABOUT TWELVE MILES FORMING CHARMING SAUNTERING GROUNDS FROM WHICH THE GLORIOUS MOUNTAINS MAY BE ENJOYED AS THEY LOOK DOWN IN DIVINE SERENITY OVER THE DARK FORESTS THAT CLOTHE THEIR BASES
HAVE AT AN ELEVATION OF TEN THOUSAND FEET ONLY SMALL BROWN MATS OF CAREX LEAVING BARE ROCKS AROUND MORE THAN HALF THEIR SHORES YET
AND THE COAST RANGES HAZY AND DIM IN THE DISTANCE FROM GLACIER POINT GO DOWN THE TRAIL INTO THE LOWER END OF THE ILLILOUETTE BASIN CROSS ILLILOUETTE CREEK AND FOLLOW IT TO THE FALL
PERHAPS THE BEST ALL ROUND EXCURSION TIME AFTER WINTERS OF AVERAGE SNOWFALL IS FROM THE MIDDLE OF JULY TO THE MIDDLE OR END OF AUGUST THE SNOW IS THEN MELTED FROM THE WOODS AND SOUTHERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS AND THE MEADOWS AND GARDENS
THE BEST WAY TO LEAVE THE VALLEY WILL BE BY THE YOSEMITE FALL TRAIL CAMPING THE FIRST NIGHT ON THE TIOGA ROAD OPPOSITE THE EAST END OF THE HOFFMAN RANGE NEXT MORNING CLIMB MOUNT HOFFMAN
WAS FROM TWELVE TO FOURTEEN FEET WIDE THE MELTING SNOW AND ICE FORMED A NETWORK OF RILLS THAT RAN GRACEFULLY DOWN THE SURFACE OF THE GLACIER MERRILY SINGING IN THEIR SHINING CHANNELS
I SHOULD START AT DAYBREAK SAY AT THREE O'CLOCK IN MIDSUMMER WITH A POCKETFUL OF ANY SORT OF DRY BREAKFAST STUFF FOR GLACIER POINT SENTINEL DOME THE HEAD OF ILLILOUETTE FALL NEVADA FALL
BESIDE THE ENTHUSIASTIC THRONG OF STARRY COMET LIKE WATERS TO LEARN SOMETHING OF THEIR STRENGTH THEIR MARVELOUS VARIETY OF FORMS AND ABOVE ALL THEIR GLORIOUS MUSIC
THE OTHER EASTWARD TO MOUNT DANA AND MOUNT GIBBS ALONG BOTH FORKS STRIPS OF MEADOW EXTEND ALMOST TO THEIR HEADS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PORTIONS OF THE MEADOWS ARE SPREAD OVER LAKE BASINS
AS ON THE FOREGOING EXCURSION YOU LEAVE THE VALLEY BY THE YOSEMITE FALLS TRAIL
THREE BROTHERS AND EL CAPITAN WITH THE DOME PAVED BASIN OF YOSEMITE CREEK AND MOUNT HOFFMAN IN THE BACKGROUND
AND GREATER THAN ALL THE STUPENDOUS SCENERY INTO THE HEART OF WHICH THE WHITE PASSIONATE RIVER GOES WILDLY THUNDERING SURPASSING EVERYTHING OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD AFTER AN UNMEASURED HOUR OR SO OF THIS GLORY
AT A HEIGHT OF ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET THE GREAT HALF DOME COMES FULL IN SIGHT OVERSHADOWING EVERY OTHER FEATURE OF THE VALLEY TO THE EASTWARD
AND OFFER NO APPRECIABLE RESISTANCE IN WALKING THROUGH THEM ALONG THE EDGES OF THE MEADOWS BENEATH THE PINES AND THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF THE VALLEY TALL RIBBON LEAVED GRASSES GROW IN ABUNDANCE CHIEFLY BROMUS
ARE CONTINUED IN STRAGGLING MASSES ALONG THE WALLS
CHAPTER TWELVE HOW BEST TO SPEND ONE'S YOSEMITE TIME
HAIRBELL MOUNTAIN COLUMBINE POTENTILLA ASTRAGALUS AND A FEW GENTIANS WITH CHARMING HEATHWORTS BRYANTHUS CASSIOPE KALMIA VACCINIUM IN BOULDER FRINGING RINGS OR BANK COVERS
AND IF CURIOUS ABOUT SUCH THINGS YOU MAY DISCOVER SPECIMENS OF THIS HARDY TREE MOUNTAINEER NOT MORE THAN FOUR FEET HIGH AND ABOUT AS MANY INCHES IN DIAMETER AT THE GROUND
THOUSANDS OF THE LITTLE PLANT PEOPLE WILL GAZE AT YOUR CAMP FIRE WITH THE CRYSTALS AND STARS COMPANIONS AND GUARDIANS AS YOU LIE AT REST IN THE HEART OF THE VAST SERENE NIGHT
SOME SPECIMENS THAT I MEASURED WERE OVER A HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND TWENTY FOUR FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE SHOWING HARDLY A TRACE OF SEVERE STORMS LOOKING AS FRESH AND VIGOROUS AS THE GIANTS OF THE LOWER ZONES
RISING EARLY WHICH WILL BE EASY AS YOUR BED WILL BE RATHER COLD AND YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SLEEP MUCH ANYHOW AFTER VISITING THE GLACIER CLIMB THE RED MOUNTAIN AND ENJOY THE MAGNIFICENT VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT
THAT ONE MAY RIDE A MULE TO THE VERY SUMMIT ACROSS MANY A BUSY STREAM FROM MEADOW TO MEADOW LIES YOUR FLOWERY WAY MOUNTAINS ALL ABOUT YOU FEW OF THEM HIDDEN BY IRREGULAR FOREGROUNDS
NARROW STRIPS OF PINE WOODS CROSS THE MEADOW CARPET FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND IT IS SOMEWHAT ROUGHENED HERE AND THERE BY MORAINE BOULDERS AND DEAD TREES BROUGHT DOWN FROM THE HEIGHTS BY SNOW AVALANCHES
THE HEAD OF THE RIBBON FALL ACROSS THE BEAUTIFUL RIBBON CREEK BASIN AND BACK TO THE VALLEY BY THE BIG OAK FLAT WAGON ROAD
LIKE ARTIFICIAL EMBANKMENTS COVERED WITH A MAGNIFICENT GROWTH OF SILVER FIR AND PINE BUT THIS GARDEN AND FOREST LUXURIANCE IS SPEEDILY LEFT BEHIND
WERE THE MOST INTERESTING OF THEM ALL THE PATH OF THE VANISHED GLACIER SHONE IN MANY PLACES AS IF WASHED WITH SILVER AND PUSHING UP THE CANYON ON THIS BRIGHT ROAD I PASSED LAKE AFTER LAKE IN SOLID BASINS OF GRANITE
WHICH WILL LEAD YOU DOWN TO THE VALLEY BY THE VERNAL AND NEVADA FALLS IF YOU ARE A GOOD WALKER YOU CAN LEAVE THE TRAIL WHERE IT BEGINS TO DESCEND A STEEP SLOPE IN THE SILVER FIR WOODS
THE UPPER TUOLUMNE EXCURSION WE COME NOW TO THE GRANDEST OF ALL THE YOSEMITE EXCURSIONS ONE THAT REQUIRES AT LEAST TWO OR THREE WEEKS THE BEST TIME TO MAKE IT IS FROM ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF JULY
AND DOWN ITS FINE GRADES TO THE VALLEY ENJOYING GLORIOUS YOSEMITE SCENERY ALL THE WAY TO THE FOOT OF EL CAPITAN AND YOUR CAMP TWO DAY EXCURSIONS
TO THE WESTWARD THE LANDSCAPE IS MADE UP OF EXCEEDINGLY STRONG GRAY GLACIATED DOMES AND RIDGE WAVES MOST OF THEM COMPARATIVELY LOW BUT THE LARGEST HIGH ENOUGH TO BE CALLED MOUNTAINS
FROM WHICH A COMPARATIVELY SHORT TIME AGO ASHES AND CINDERS WERE SHOWERED OVER THE SURROUNDING SAGE PLAINS AND GLACIER LADEN MOUNTAINS
STORM THEN FOLLOWS STORM IN QUICK SUCCESSION BURYING THE MEADOWS TO A DEPTH OF FROM TEN TO TWENTY FEET WHILE MAGNIFICENT AVALANCHES DESCEND THROUGH THE FORESTS FROM THE LADEN HEIGHTS
HORNBLENDE FELDSPAR GRANITE ZIRCON TOURMALINE ET CETERA WEATHERED OUT AND STREWN CLOSELY AND LOOSELY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN SOWN BROADCAST THEIR RADIANCE IS FAIRLY DAZZLING IN SUNLIGHT
ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER AND ITS TRIBUTARIES CASSIOPE AND BRYANTHUS MAY BE FOUND WHERE THE SOD CURLS OVER STREAM BANKS AND AROUND BOULDERS THE PRINCIPAL GRASS OF THESE MEADOWS IS A DELICATE CALAMAGROSTIS
POLISHED A THOUSAND YEARS AGO AND STILL SHINING TOWARDS THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN YOU NOTE THE DWARFING OF THE TREES UNTIL AT A HEIGHT OF ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET YOU FIND PATCHES OF THE TOUGH WHITE BARKED PINE
BOUNDED BY ITS SNOWY PEAKS IN GLORIOUS ARRAY SOUTHWARD YOSEMITE AND WESTWARD THE VAST FOREST ON NO OTHER YOSEMITE PARK MOUNTAIN ARE YOU MORE LIKELY TO LINGER YOU WILL FIND IT A MAGNIFICENT SKY CAMP
AND MANY A MEADOW ALONG THE CANYON STREAM THAT LINKS THEM TOGETHER THE MAIN LATERAL MORAINES THAT BOUND THE VIEW BELOW THE CANYON ARE FROM A HUNDRED TO NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND WONDERFULLY REGULAR
NORTHWARD LIES YOSEMITE'S WIDE BASIN WITH ITS DOMES AND SMALL LAKES SHINING LIKE LARGER CRYSTALS EASTWARD THE ROCKY
AND THE LIBERTY CAP WITH FINE SIDE VIEWS OF BOTH THE FALL AND THE ROCK PASS ON THROUGH CLOUDS OF SPRAY AND ALONG THE RAPIDS TO THE HEAD OF THE VERNAL FALL ABOUT A MILE BELOW THE NEVADA
LINGER HERE IF NIGHT IS STILL DISTANT FOR VIEWS OF THIS FAVORITE FALL AND THE STUPENDOUS ROCK SCENERY ABOUT IT THEN DESCEND A STAIRWAY BY ITS SIDE FOLLOW A DIM TRAIL THROUGH ITS SPRAY
AND GO DOWN INTO THE HEAD OF LITTLE YOSEMITE AND THENCE DOWN PAST THE NEVADA AND VERNAL FALLS TO THE VALLEY A TRULY GLORIOUS TWO DAY TRIP A THREE DAY EXCURSION
FROM GLACIER POINT YOU LOOK DOWN THREE THOUSAND FEET OVER THE EDGE OF ITS SHEER FACE TO THE MEADOWS AND GROVES AND INNUMERABLE YELLOW PINE SPIRES
COMBINED WITH INEFFABLE FINENESS OF BEAUTY DRAGGING YOURSELF AWAY GO TO THE HEAD OF THE RIBBON FALL THENCE ACROSS THE BEAUTIFUL RIBBON CREEK BASIN TO THE BIG OAK FLAT STAGE ROAD
ARE IN THEIR GLORY WHILE THE WEATHER IS MOSTLY ALL REVIVING EXHILARATING SUNSHINE THE FEW CLOUDS THAT RISE NOW AND THEN AND THE SHOWERS THEY YIELD ARE ONLY ENOUGH TO KEEP EVERYTHING FRESH AND FRAGRANT
AND CAMP THERE ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY GO TO THE TOP OF MOUNT DANA IN TIME FOR THE GLORY OF THE DAWN
TO THE SOUTHWARD THERE IS A WELL DEFINED RANGE OF PALE GRAY EXTINCT VOLCANOES AND THOUGH THE HIGHEST OF THEM RISES NEARLY TWO THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LAKE YOU CAN LOOK DOWN FROM HERE INTO THEIR CIRCULAR CUP LIKE CRATERS
THE EXCURSION TO THE TOP OF MOUNT DANA IS A VERY EASY ONE FOR THOUGH THE MOUNTAIN IS THIRTEEN THOUSAND FEET HIGH THE ASCENT FROM THE WEST SIDE IS SO GENTLE AND SMOOTH
THE GROVES ABOUT THE SODA SPRINGS ARE FAVORITE CAMPING GROUNDS ON ACCOUNT OF THE COLD PLEASANT TASTING WATER CHARGED WITH CARBONIC ACID AND BECAUSE OF THE VIEWS OF THE MOUNTAINS ACROSS THE MEADOW THE GLACIER MONUMENT CATHEDRAL PEAK
A SHORT DISTANCE EAST OF PORCUPINE FLAT FROM THAT POINT PUSH STRAIGHT UP TO THE SUMMIT MOUNT HOFFMAN IS A MASS OF GRAY GRANITE THAT RISES ALMOST IN THE CENTER OF THE YOSEMITE PARK
ALMOST HIDING THE MULTITUDE OF SMALL FLOWERS THAT GROW AMONG THEM AT FIRST SIGHT ONLY THESE RADIANT CRYSTALS ARE LIKELY TO BE NOTICED BUT LOOKING CLOSELY YOU DISCOVER A MULTITUDE OF VERY SMALL
THENCE BY THE SUNRISE TRAIL TO CATHEDRAL PEAK VISITING THE BEAUTIFUL CATHEDRAL LAKE WHICH LIES ABOUT A MILE TO THE WEST OF CATHEDRAL PEAK EATING YOUR LUNCHEON AND THENCE TO CLOUDS REST AND THE VALLEY AS ABOVE
ABOUT EIGHT OR TEN MILES IN A STRAIGHT LINE FROM THE VALLEY ITS SOUTHERN SLOPES ARE LOW AND EASILY CLIMBED AND ADORNED HERE AND THERE WITH CASTLE LIKE CRUMBLING PILES AND LONG JAGGED CRESTS
WHERE FROM AN OUTJUTTING ROCK AT ITS HEAD YOU WILL GET A FINE VIEW OF ITS REJOICING WATERS AND WILD CANYON AND THE HALF DOME THENCE RETURNING TO THE TRAIL FOLLOW IT TO THE HEAD OF THE NEVADA FALL
BETWEEN THE FALL AND A PLAIN MURAL CLIFF THAT IS BURNISHED HERE AND THERE BY GLACIAL ACTION YOU SHOULD STOP A WHILE ON A FLAT IRON FENCED ROCK A LITTLE BELOW THE HEAD OF THE FALL
AND REJOICING WITH EVERYTHING THE LIBERTY CAP A COMPANION OF THE HALF DOME IS SHEER AND INACCESSIBLE ON THREE OF ITS SIDES
AND AS YOU SLOWLY SAUNTER FROM POINT TO POINT ALONG ITS MANY ACCOMMODATING ZIGZAGS NEARLY ALL THE VALLEY ROCKS AND FALLS ARE SEEN IN STRIKING EVER CHANGING COMBINATIONS
YOU FOLLOW YOUR TRAIL WAY THROUGH SILVER FIR AND PINE WOODS TO EAGLE PEAK WHERE THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE OF ALL THE VIEWS TO BE HAD ON THE NORTH WALL HEIGHTS ARE DISPLAYED AFTER AN HOUR OR TWO OF GAZING DREAMING
ANOTHER GRAND ONE DAY EXCURSION IS TO THE UPPER YOSEMITE FALL THE TOP OF THE HIGHEST OF THE THREE BROTHERS CALLED EAGLE PEAK ON THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MAPS THE BROW OF EL CAPITAN
WHILE THE GLACIER MEADOWS WILL BE IN THEIR GLORY AND THE SNOW ON THE MOUNTAINS WILL BE FIRM ENOUGH TO MAKE CLIMBING SAFE LONG AGO I MADE THESE SIERRA TRIPS CARRYING ONLY A SACKFUL OF BREAD WITH A LITTLE TEA AND SUGAR AND WAS THUS INDEPENDENT AND FREE
STRANGE TO SAY AMID ALL THIS ARCTIC REPRESSION THE MOUNTAIN PINE ON LEDGES AND BUTTRESSES OF RED MOUNTAIN SEEMS TO FIND THE CLIMATE BEST SUITED TO IT
AND SAN JOAQUIN RIVERS ARE PRESENTED IN BEWILDERING ARRAY
GATHERED AND COMPOSED FROM THE SNOW STORMS HAIL RAIN AND WIND STORMS THAT HAVE FALLEN ON THEIR GLACIER SCULPTURED DOMEY RIDGY BASIN REFRESHED AND EXHILARATED
THE DAYS ARE STILL WARM AND CALM AND BEES AND BUTTERFLIES CONTINUE TO WAVER AND HUM ABOUT THE LATE BLOOMING FLOWERS UNTIL THE COMING OF THE SNOW USUALLY IN NOVEMBER
TO THE VALLEY IN GOOD TIME PROVIDED YOU LEFT YOUR HOFFMAN SKY CAMP EARLY TWO DAY EXCURSIONS
WHICH BROAD DEEP AND FAR REACHING EXERTED VAST INFLUENCE ON THE SCENERY OF THIS PORTION OF THE SIERRA BUT THERE ARE FINE CAMPING GROUNDS
LINGER HERE AN HOUR OR TWO FOR NOT ONLY HAVE YOU GLORIOUS VIEWS OF THE WONDERFUL FALL BUT OF ITS WILD LEAPING EXULTING RAPIDS
WHICH HAVE BEEN FILLED UP BY DEPOSITS FROM THE RIVER A FEW OF THESE RIVER LAKES STILL EXIST BUT THEY ARE NOW SHALLOW AND ARE RAPIDLY APPROACHING EXTINCTION
EARLY NEXT MORNING I SET OUT TO TRACE THE ANCIENT GLACIER TO ITS HEAD PASSING AROUND THE NORTH SHORE OF MY CAMP LAKE I FOLLOWED THE MAIN STREAM FROM ONE LAKELET TO ANOTHER
AND PASS THE NIGHT WHERE I CAMPED FORTY ONE YEARS AGO
SEPARATED BY CANYONS AND DARKENED WITH LINES AND FIELDS OF FOREST CATHEDRAL PEAK AND MOUNT HOFFMAN IN THE DISTANCE SMALL LAKES AND INNUMERABLE MEADOWS IN THE FOREGROUND
AND BEYOND ALL MARSHALED ALONG THE EASTERN HORIZON THE ICY SUMMITS ON THE AXIS OF THE RANGE AND BROAD SWATHS OF FORESTS GROWING ON ANCIENT MORAINES WHILE THE NEVADA VERNAL
TRITICUM AND AGROSTIS IN OCTOBER THE NIGHTS ARE FROSTY AND THEN THE MEADOWS AT SUNRISE WHEN EVERY LEAF IS LADEN WITH CRYSTALS ARE A FINE SIGHT
AND GRADUALLY WORK YOUR WAY UP IN AN ALMOST STRAIGHT SOUTH DIRECTION TO THE SUMMIT OF THE DIVIDE BETWEEN TENAYA CREEK
GLACIER LAKES AND GLACIER MEADOWS ET CETERA BUT SECTIONS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SILVER FIR
THE SOD IN MOST PLACES IS EXCEEDINGLY FINE AND SILKY AND FREE FROM WEEDS AND BUSHES WHILE CHARMING FLOWERS ABOUND ESPECIALLY GENTIANS DWARF DAISIES POTENTILLAS
ON THE STUDY TABLE AND AWAITING HIS JUDICIOUS SELECTION AND BY THE SERMON BOOK WAS THE OBSERVER NEWSPAPER DAMP AND NEATLY FOLDED AND FOR SIR PITT'S OWN PRIVATE USE
AND THE BARKING BUTCHER WHICH HAS BEEN BEFORE MENTIONED A VENERABLE BRISTLY WARRIOR WITH A LITTLE CLOSE SHAVED GREY HEAD WITH A SILK NIGHTCAP A RED FACE AND NOSE AND A GREAT
IN HER MORNING GOWN WAS UP AND ABOVE STAIRS IN THE NURSERY SUPERINTENDING THE TOILETTES OF HER CHILDREN AND LISTENING TO THE MORNING PRAYERS WHICH THE LITTLE CREATURES PERFORMED AT HER KNEE
SHE MAY BE INNOCENT AFTER ALL HE SAID SHE SAYS SO
WHICH CONTAINS BIRTHS MARRIAGES AND DEATHS WHATEVER BECKY'S PRIVATE PLAN MIGHT BE BY WHICH DOBBIN'S TRUE LOVE WAS TO BE CROWNED WITH SUCCESS
I TOLD HIM HE WAS A LIAR AND A COWARD AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN AND THRASHED HIM SERVE HIM RIGHT MACMURDO SAID WHO IS IT RAWDON ANSWERED IT WAS LORD STEYNE
FOR HIS ACQUAINTANCES WITH THE GREATEST PRUDENCE AND SKILL HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE LATE LAMENTED COMMANDER IN CHIEF HAD HAD THE GREATEST REGARD FOR MACMURDO ON THIS ACCOUNT
AS FOR EMMY WHO FOUND HERSELF NOT IN THE LEAST MISTRESS OF HER OWN HOUSE EXCEPT WHEN THE BILLS WERE TO BE PAID BECKY SOON DISCOVERED THE WAY TO SOOTHE AND PLEASE HER
THIS IS WHAT HE GAVE HER MAC AND SHE KEP IT UNKNOWN TO ME AND WITH THIS MONEY IN THE HOUSE SHE REFUSED TO STAND BY ME WHEN I WAS LOCKED UP
OVER AND OVER AGAIN SHE TOLD HIM HOW THEY OWED EVERYTHING WHICH THEY POSSESSED IN THE WORLD TO THAT KIND FRIEND'S BENEVOLENT CARE OF THEM HOW HE HAD BEFRIENDED THEM ALL THROUGH THEIR POVERTY AND MISFORTUNES
SHE WAS RECONCILED TO MISSUS CRAWLEY SUBSEQUENTLY BECAUSE THE LATTER BECAME WILLIAM'S MOST ARDENT ADMIRER AND CHAMPION AND IN THOSE NIGHTLY CONCLAVES IN WHICH THE TWO LADIES INDULGED AFTER THEIR PARTIES
HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE HURRIEDLY THE PERSONAL CONFLICT WITH LORD STEYNE TO AN AFFAIR OF THAT NATURE OF COURSE HE SAID THERE WAS BUT ONE ISSUE
TO GO TO CHURCH THOUGH HER THOUGHTS HAD BEEN ENTIRELY ASTRAY DURING THE PERIOD OF FAMILY DEVOTION RAWDON CRAWLEY MEANWHILE HURRIED ON FROM GREAT GAUNT STREET AND KNOCKING AT THE GREAT
IT HAS BEEN SAID WAS HEART AND SOUL IN FAVOUR OF THE GENEROUS MAJOR HAVING AT FIRST DISLIKED BECKY FOR BEING THE MEANS OF DISMISSING HIM FROM THE PRESENCE OF HER MISTRESS
BUT ABOUT GOING HOME NEXT SATURDAY WHEN HIS FATHER WOULD CERTAINLY TIP HIM AND PERHAPS WOULD TAKE HIM TO THE PLAY HE'S A REGULAR TRUMP THAT BOY THE FATHER WENT ON STILL MUSING ABOUT HIS SON
SHE HAD A GREAT NUMBER OF THINGS PERTAINING TO HERSELF TO CONSIDER AND WHICH CONCERNED HER A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN MAJOR DOBBIN'S HAPPINESS IN THIS LIFE
SHE TALKED TO HER PERPETUALLY ABOUT MAJOR DOBBIN SENT ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND MADE NO SCRUPLE OF DECLARING HER ADMIRATION FOR THAT EXCELLENT HIGH MINDED GENTLEMAN
AS THEY KNELT DOWN TO PRAYERS WHICH SIR PITT READ TO THEM AND TO THE SERVANTS IN THEIR SUNDAY SUITS OR LIVERIES RANGED UPON CHAIRS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HISSING TEA URN
I SAY MAC IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG IF I DROP I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO TO GO AND SEE HIM YOU KNOW AND SAY THAT I WAS VERY FOND OF HIM AND THAT
AND HER NIECE AS THEY WERE TAKING EARLY TEA AND HOT BUTTERED TOAST IN THE FORMER LADY'S APARTMENT AND WONDERED HOW THE RAWDING CRAWLEYS COULD GIT ON THE VALET HAD DAMPED AND FOLDED THE PAPER ONCE MORE
CAME TO DINE WITH JOS AND THEN CAME EVERY DAY TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO BECKY POOR EMMY WHO WAS NEVER VERY TALKATIVE AND MORE GLUM AND SILENT THAN EVER AFTER DOBBIN'S DEPARTURE WAS QUITE FORGOTTEN
AS HE STRODE AWAY SO DID THE PEOPLE IN THEIR SUNDAY CLOTHES WHO WERE OUT SO EARLY THE CHARITY BOYS WITH SHINING FACES THE GREENGROCER LOLLING AT HIS DOOR
THE MAN ADDED AFTER A PAUSE ONE OF THE SERVANTS IS OFF ALREADY
WITH WHICH AND LEAVING THE COLONEL TO DRESS HIMSELF MACMURDO TURNED ROUND TOWARDS THE WALL AND RESUMED THE PERUSAL OF BELL'S LIFE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HIS FRIEND'S TOILETTE WAS COMPLETE
A MODEL OF NEATNESS AND EVERY PROPRIETY HE STARTED WHEN HE SAW POOR RAWDON IN HIS STUDY IN TUMBLED CLOTHES WITH BLOOD SHOT EYES AND HIS HAIR OVER HIS FACE
HAD BEEN TORN TO SHREDS THERE'S NO WAY BUT ONE OUT OF IT
TOO HOW TO LOVE AND TO SING CERTAIN SONGS I SAY TO WHICH THE MAJOR WAS PARTIAL
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE IT WAS A REGULAR PLAN BETWEEN THAT SCOUNDREL AND HER HE SAID THE BAILIFFS WERE PUT UPON ME I WAS TAKEN AS I WAS GOING OUT OF HIS HOUSE WHEN I WROTE TO HER FOR MONEY
CAPTAIN MARKER IT'S ABOUT ABOUT MY WIFE CRAWLEY ANSWERED CASTING DOWN HIS EYES AND TURNING VERY RED THE OTHER GAVE A WHISTLE
THINK OF HIS ONLY FINDING HER OUT NOW THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AND REMEMBERED A HUNDRED PARTICULAR CONVERSATIONS AT THE MESS TABLE IN WHICH MISSUS CRAWLEY'S REPUTATION
AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP NEVER CEASED FROM THAT DAY UNTIL THE LAST WHEN YOUR DEAR FATHER FELL DID DOBBIN KILL THE MAN WHO KILLED PAPA
DURING WHICH REBECCA WAS LEFT TO THE SOCIETY OF MISTER JOSEPH
SPEEDILY MADE HIS WAY UP TO THE ROOM OF HIS OLD FRIEND AND COMRADE CAPTAIN MACMURDO WHO CRAWLEY FOUND TO HIS SATISFACTION WAS IN BARRACKS CAPTAIN MACMURDO
EVEN THE HUNDRED POUNDS THAT JANE TOOK YOU LAST NIGHT WERE PROMISED TO MY LAWYER TO MORROW MORNING AND THE WANT OF IT WILL PUT ME TO GREAT INCONVENIENCE
PUNCTUALLY AS THE SHRILL TONED BELL OF THE BLACK MARBLE STUDY CLOCK BEGAN TO CHIME NINE SIR PITT MADE HIS APPEARANCE FRESH NEAT SMUGLY SHAVED
SIR PITT INSTANTLY GUESSED THE TRUTH AND SURMISED THAT LORD STEYNE WAS THE PERSON WHOSE LIFE RAWDON WISHED TO TAKE THE COLONEL TOLD HIS SENIOR BRIEFLY AND IN BROKEN ACCENTS
MISTER MACMURDO HAD ALSO OCCASION TO TAKE OFF HIS SILK NIGHT CAP AND RUB IT ACROSS HIS EYES GO DOWN AND ORDER SOME BREAKFAST HE SAID TO HIS MAN IN A LOUD CHEERFUL VOICE WHAT'LL YOU HAVE CRAWLEY
HE THOUGHT HIS BROTHER WAS NOT SOBER
HAD HE BEEN LOOKING OUT TROOPS OF SCHOOLS WERE ON THEIR MARCH TO CHURCH
SHE WAS VERY DISTRAITE NERVOUS SILENT AND ILL TO PLEASE THE FAMILY HAD NEVER KNOWN HER SO PEEVISH SHE GREW PALE AND ILL
AND SAY HIS PRAYERS IN THE MOSQUES
BROUGHT OUT THE PURPLE SILENUS IN A RED AND SILVER WAISTCOAT WHO ACTS AS PORTER OF THAT PALACE THE MAN WAS SCARED ALSO BY THE COLONEL'S DISHEVELLED APPEARANCE
AND AS SHE LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND'S PORTRAIT OF NIGHTS IT NO LONGER REPROACHED HER PERHAPS SHE REPROACHED IT NOW WILLIAM WAS GONE EMMY WAS NOT VERY HAPPY AFTER HER HEROIC SACRIFICE
AND TO SUCH AN ANGEL AS HIM WHOM SHE HAD HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO MARRY WAS MARRIED FOREVER BUT SHE HAD NO OBJECTION TO HEAR THE MAJOR PRAISED
THANK YOU BROTHER SAID HE I KNOW I CAN TRUST YOUR WORD I WILL UPON MY HONOUR THE BARONET SAID AND THUS AND ALMOST MUTELY
THE ELDER BROTHER WAS MUCH AFFECTED AND SHOOK RAWDON'S HAND WITH A CORDIALITY SELDOM EXHIBITED BY HIM RAWDON PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS SHAGGY EYEBROWS
THE MAN AS WAS VERY NOISY AND DRUNK INDEED SAYS NOTHING SHALL GO OUT OF THE HOUSE UNTIL HIS WAGES IS PAID UP THE ACCOUNT OF THIS LITTLE REVOLUTION IN MAY FAIR ASTONISHED
WENT THROUGH THE COURT LAST WEEK AND WAS WHAT THEY CALL WHITEWASHED I BELIEVE LORD RAGLAND WOULD NOT PAY A SHILLING FOR HIM AND IT'S NOT MONEY I WANT RAWDON BROKE IN I'M NOT COME TO YOU ABOUT MYSELF
BREAKFAST WAS SO LATE THAT DAY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DELAYS WHICH HAD OCCURRED THAT THE CHURCH BELLS BEGAN TO RING WHILST THEY WERE SITTING OVER THEIR MEAL AND LADY JANE WAS TOO ILL SHE SAID
AND I'VE ALWAYS FELT ASHAMED OF HAVING TAKEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN'S MONEY AND HERE'S SOME MORE I'VE ONLY KEPT BACK A FEW POUNDS WHICH BECKY MAY AS WELL HAVE
WERE THRONGED WITH PEOPLE OUT UPON THEIR SUNDAY PLEASURE BUT THE COLONEL WAS MUCH TOO BUSY TO TAKE ANY HEED OF THESE PHENOMENA AND ARRIVING AT KNIGHTSBRIDGE
AND HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY BEFRIENDED BY THE GOOD WILLIAM WHY WHEN YOUR PAPA WAS A LITTLE BOY SHE SAID HE OFTEN TOLD ME THAT IT WAS WILLIAM WHO DEFENDED HIM AGAINST A TYRANT AT THE SCHOOL WHERE THEY WERE
SO THAT IT LOOKED QUITE FRESH AND INNOCENT AGAINST THE ARRIVAL OF THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE POOR RAWDON TOOK UP THE PAPER AND BEGAN TO TRY AND READ IT UNTIL HIS BROTHER SHOULD ARRIVE
LET'S SAY AND CLAY LAY OUT SOME DRESSING THINGS FOR THE COLONEL WE WERE ALWAYS PRETTY MUCH OF A SIZE RAWDON MY BOY AND NEITHER OF US RIDE SO LIGHT AS WE DID WHEN WE FIRST ENTERED THE CORPS
RAWDON SAID WITH A BROKEN VOICE AND AS THE BOY HAS NO MOTHER I MUST LEAVE HIM TO YOU AND JANE PITT ONLY IT WILL BE A COMFORT TO ME IF YOU WILL PROMISE ME TO BE HIS FRIEND
SAID THE MAN THERE'S A REGULAR SHINTY IN THE HOUSE AND EVERYTHING AT SIXES AND SEVENS THE LANDLORD'S COME IN AND TOOK POSSESSION THE SERVANTS WAS A DRINKIN UP IN THE DRAWINGROOM THEY SAID
AS RAWDON IN HIS EVENING COSTUME WHICH HE HAD NOW WORN TWO DAYS PASSED BY THE SCARED FEMALE WHO WAS SCOURING THE STEPS AND ENTERED INTO HIS BROTHER'S STUDY LADY JANE
CAPTAIN MACMURDO HAD THE HONOUR OF WAITING UPON THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE ON THE PART OF COLONEL RAWDON CRAWLEY AND BEGGED TO INTIMATE THAT HE WAS EMPOWERED BY THE COLONEL
THAN THEY HAD BEEN TO BESTOW THE SAME INESTIMABLE BENEFITS UPON AMELIA LOVE AND LIBERTY ARE INTERPRETED BY THOSE SIMPLE GERMANS IN A WAY WHICH HONEST FOLKS
THAT ONE PLACED FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE STEWARD AGENT OR CONFIDENTIAL VISITOR WHO CAME TO TRANSACT BUSINESS WITH THE BARONET AND TRIMMED HIS NAILS MORE VEHEMENTLY THAN EVER PITT
THE DEUCE A MARQUIS THEY SAID HE THAT IS THEY SAID YOU WHAT THE DEVIL DO YOU MEAN ROARED OUT RAWDON DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU EVER HEARD A FELLOW DOUBT ABOUT MY WIFE
DYED MOUSTACHE WHEN RAWDON TOLD THE CAPTAIN HE WANTED A FRIEND THE LATTER KNEW PERFECTLY WELL ON WHAT DUTY OF FRIENDSHIP HE WAS CALLED TO ACT AND INDEED HAD CONDUCTED SCORES OF AFFAIRS
AND WHILE MISS PAYNE WAS BRUSHING THEIR AIRS
WAS ONE OF THEM THAT TENDER LOVE SONG OF WEBER'S WHICH IN OLD FASHIONED DAYS YOUNG LADIES AND WHEN YOU WERE SCARCELY BORN SHOWED THAT THOSE WHO LIVED BEFORE YOU KNEW
WATCHED OVER THEM WHEN NOBODY CARED FOR THEM HOW ALL HIS COMRADES ADMIRED HIM THOUGH HE NEVER SPOKE OF HIS OWN GALLANT ACTIONS HOW GEORGY'S FATHER TRUSTED HIM BEYOND ALL OTHER MEN
SHE WOULD BREAK OFF IN THE MIDST OF THE SONG
THERE HEARD OF HER FASCINATIONS AND WERE QUITE CURIOUS TO KNOW HER WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT SHE WAS NOBLE OF AN ANCIENT ENGLISH FAMILY THAT HER HUSBAND WAS A COLONEL OF THE GUARD
SHE'S BEEN MAKING A PURSE FOR HERSELF ALL THE TIME AND GRUDGED ME A HUNDRED POUND TO GET ME OUT OF QUOD HE THEN FIERCELY AND INCOHERENTLY AND WITH AN AGITATION
EVERY MORNING SHE AND THEY PERFORMED THIS DUTY PRIVATELY AND BEFORE THE PUBLIC CEREMONIAL AT WHICH SIR PITT PRESIDED AND AT WHICH ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSEHOLD WERE EXPECTED TO ASSEMBLE
ANY EXPLANATION THE CHILDREN CAME UP TO SALUTE HIM AND HE KISSED THEM IN HIS USUAL FRIGID MANNER THE MOTHER TOOK BOTH OF THEM CLOSE TO HERSELF AND HELD A HAND OF EACH OF THEM
IT WAS DAMNED UNFRIENDLY MAC SAID RAWDON QUITE OVERCOME AND COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS HE GAVE WAY TO AN EMOTION THE SIGHT OF WHICH CAUSED THE TOUGH OLD CAMPAIGNER
AND THE DARK LOOKS OF HER HUSBAND THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE QUESTION OF BREAKFAST BETWEEN THEM RAWDON MUTTERED SOME EXCUSES ABOUT AN ENGAGEMENT SQUEEZING HARD THE TIMID LITTLE HAND
A VETERAN OFFICER AND WATERLOO MAN GREATLY LIKED BY HIS REGIMENT IN WHICH WANT OF MONEY ALONE PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTAINING THE HIGHEST RANKS WAS ENJOYING THE FORENOON CALMLY IN BED
I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL TAKE CHARGE OF HIM WHEN I'M GONE THAT DEAR GOOD WIFE OF YOURS HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD TO HIM AND HE'S FONDER OF HER THAN HE IS OF HIS DAMN IT LOOK HERE PITT
IN A WAY WHICH EVEN MADE THE BOY SMILE SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE THOUGHT MAJOR WILLIAM WAS THE BEST MAN IN ALL THE WORLD THE GENTLEST AND THE KINDEST THE BRAVEST AND THE HUMBLEST
BUT FOR THIS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUITE A DIFFERENT MAN I DIDN'T DO MY DUTY WITH THE REGIMENT SO BAD YOU KNOW HOW I WAS THROWN OVER ABOUT THE MONEY AND WHO GOT IT
I WISH I WAS RAWDON REPLIED IF IT WASN'T FOR LITTLE RAWDON I'D HAVE CUT MY THROAT THIS MORNING AND THAT DAMNED VILLAIN'S TOO
RAWDON DISPATCHED CAPTAIN MACMURDO'S SERVANT TO CURZON STREET WITH AN ORDER TO THE DOMESTIC THERE TO GIVE UP A BAG OF CLOTHES OF WHICH THE COLONEL HAD GREAT NEED AND DURING THE MAN'S ABSENCE
AND THERE'S ONLY A WAY OUT OF IT FOR ONE OF US MAC DO YOU UNDERSTAND I WAS PUT OUT OF THE WAY ARRESTED I FOUND EM ALONE TOGETHER
HIS SCANTY HAIR COMBED AND OILED TRIMMING HIS NAILS AS HE DESCENDED THE STAIRS MAJESTICALLY IN A STARCHED CRAVAT AND A GREY FLANNEL DRESSING GOWN A REAL OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN IN A WORD
AND SAY THAT COLONEL CRAWLEY WOULD BE ALL DAY AFTER ONE O'CLOCK AT THE REGENT CLUB IN SAINT JAMES'S STREET NOT AT HOME THE FAT RED FACED MAN LOOKED AFTER HIM WITH ASTONISHMENT
AND AFTER HIS CONFERENCE WITH HIS BROTHER HE WAS GOING AWAY TO MAKE THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MEETING WHICH MUST ENSUE
UNDER WHICH HIS COUNSELLOR HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN HIM LABOUR TOLD MACMURDO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE STORY HIS ADVISER CAUGHT AT SOME STRAY HINTS IN IT
AS THE TWO BROTHERS PASSED OUT OF THE STUDY SHE HELD OUT HER HAND TO RAWDON AND SAID SHE WAS GLAD HE WAS COME TO BREAKFAST THOUGH SHE COULD PERCEIVE BY HIS HAGGARD UNSHORN FACE
TO WRAP A BALL IN THE NOTE AND KILL STEYNE WITH IT AFTER THIS COLLOQUY THE BROTHERS ONCE MORE SHOOK HANDS AND PARTED
I GAVE UP EVERYTHING I HAD TO HER I'M A BEGGAR BECAUSE I WOULD MARRY HER BY JOVE SIR I'VE PAWNED MY OWN WATCH IN ORDER TO GET HER ANYTHING SHE FANCIED AND SHE
THE LITTLE WOMAN THOUGHT THAT THE SECRET MIGHT KEEP AND INDEED BEING BY NO MEANS SO MUCH INTERESTED
TO GET ON WITH AS HE SPOKE
BUT HIS HANDS SHOOK AND HE WAS SO AGITATED THAT THE POCKET BOOK FELL FROM HIM AND OUT OF IT THE THOUSAND POUND NOTE WHICH HAD BEEN THE LAST OF THE UNLUCKY BECKY'S WINNINGS
AND EVERY KIND OF PERSON IN A WORD WAS RESTING HIMSELF AFTER THE NIGHT'S LABOURS AND NOT BEING ON DUTY WAS IN BED HIS ROOM WAS HUNG ROUND WITH BOXING SPORTING AND DANCING PICTURES
RUMMAGING HIS MOTHER'S DESK SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FOUND THE GLOVES NEATLY FOLDED UP
IN THE MOST POLITE MANNER TO APPOINT A FRIEND WITH WHOM HE CAPTAIN M M MIGHT COMMUNICATE AND DESIRED THAT THE MEETING MIGHT TAKE PLACE WITH AS LITTLE DELAY AS POSSIBLE
AND THE PUBLICAN SHUTTING HIS SHUTTERS IN THE SUNSHINE AGAINST SERVICE COMMENCED THE PEOPLE JOKED AT THE CAB STAND ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE AS HE TOOK A CARRIAGE THERE
I ALWAYS SAID SHE'D THROW YOU OVER HE BEGAN INDEED THERE WERE BETS IN THE REGIMENT AND AT THE CLUBS REGARDING THE PROBABLE FATE OF COLONEL CRAWLEY
HE WAXED HIS MUSTACHIOS INTO A STATE OF BRILLIANT POLISH AND PUT ON A TIGHT CRAVAT AND A TRIM BUFF WAISTCOAT SO THAT ALL THE YOUNG OFFICERS IN THE MESS ROOM WHITHER CRAWLEY HAD PRECEDED HIS FRIEND
AND INDEED BROUGHT THE CONVERSATION ROUND TO THE DOBBIN SUBJECT A SCORE OF TIMES EVERY DAY MEANS WERE EASILY FOUND TO WIN THE FAVOUR OF GEORGY AND THE SERVANTS AMELIA'S MAID
OF AMELIA HE DROVE OUT WITH BECKY IN HIS OPEN CARRIAGE HE ASKED LITTLE PARTIES AND INVENTED FESTIVITIES TO DO HER HONOUR TAPEWORM
BARRACKS ALL THE BELLS WERE JANGLING AND TOLLING AS HE REACHED THAT PLACE
HE HAD READ IN THE JOURNAL A FLAMING ACCOUNT OF FESTIVITIES AT GAUNT HOUSE
AND THE LETTERS THE NEATLY DOCKETED BILLS AND SYMMETRICAL PAMPHLETS THE LOCKED ACCOUNT BOOKS DESKS AND DISPATCH BOXES THE BIBLE THE QUARTERLY REVIEW AND THE COURT GUIDE
I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT I WON'T ASSIST YOU ULTIMATELY BUT AS FOR PAYING YOUR CREDITORS IN FULL I MIGHT AS WELL HOPE TO PAY THE NATIONAL DEBT
RAWDON SAT DOWN IN THE STUDY BEFORE THE BARONET'S TABLE
WHEN I'M IN THE ARMY WON'T I HATE THE FRENCH THAT'S ALL
SHE BROUGHT EVERYBODY TO THE HOUSE AND SHE MADE JOS BELIEVE THAT IT WAS HIS OWN GREAT SOCIAL TALENTS AND WIT
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED PITT I'M NOT DRUNK SHUT THE DOOR I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU PITT CLOSED THE DOOR AND CAME UP TO THE TABLE WHERE HE SAT DOWN IN THE OTHER ARM CHAIR
AND A NUMBER OF LADIES OF THE CORPS DE BALLET AND OLD MAC WHO WAS AT HOME WITH PEOPLE OF ALL AGES AND RANKS AND CONSORTED WITH GENERALS DOG FANCIERS OPERA DANCERS BRUISERS
SHE SAID SHE WAS ILL IN BED AND PUT ME OFF TO ANOTHER DAY AND WHEN I GOT HOME I FOUND HER IN DIAMONDS AND SITTING WITH THAT VILLAIN ALONE
IN CURZON STREET BUT WITHOUT THE CARPET BAG AND PORTMANTEAU FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN SENT AND WITH A VERY PUZZLED AND ODD FACE THEY WON'T GIVE EM UP
NEVER MIND WHAT HAPPENS TO ME WHAT IS THE MATTER THEN SAID PITT SOMEWHAT RELIEVED IT'S THE BOY SAID RAWDON IN A HUSKY VOICE
PITT STOOPED AND PICKED THEM UP AMAZED AT SO MUCH WEALTH NOT THAT RAWDON SAID I HOPE TO PUT A BULLET INTO THE MAN WHOM THAT BELONGS TO
AND WAS WAITING FOR HER HUSBAND IN THE ADJOINING DINING ROOM WITH FEMALE INSTINCT AUGURING EVIL THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM HAPPENED TO BE LEFT OPEN AND THE LADY OF COURSE WAS ISSUING FROM IT
HE HAD A SINGULAR MUSEUM HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST SHOTS IN ENGLAND AND FOR A HEAVY MAN ONE OF THE BEST RIDERS INDEED HE AND CRAWLEY
OTHERWISE HE WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF SUNDAY PAPERS INTO HIS HOUSEHOLD THE THEATRICAL CRITICISMS THE FIGHT FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS A SIDE BETWEEN THE BARKING BUTCHER
SHE PICKETED HER STEED HUNG UP HER WEAPONS AND WARMED HERSELF COMFORTABLY BY HIS FIRE THE HALT IN THAT ROVING RESTLESS LIFE WAS INEXPRESSIBLY SOOTHING AND PLEASANT TO HER
INVITED BY THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE TO MEET HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
SHE FOUND HERSELF SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY IN SNUG COMFORTABLE QUARTERS SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS KINDNESS AND GOOD NATURED SIMPLE PEOPLE
AND THE LADIES WERE EVEN MORE READY TO CALL HER DU
LESS BITTER AND LESS ABRUPT THAN THOSE WHICH SPRANG INVOLUNTARILY TO HIS LIPS BUT HE DID NOT FIND THEM THOUGH HE PITIED HIS BROTHER AND WISHED TO SHOW THAT HE DID
TURNED AND RAN AWAY MY SISTER TOLD US ABOUT THAT NEXT MORNING AND WE ALL LAUGHED AT HER SAID OLGA CONTINUING THE ACCOUNT I TOLD HER TO GO OUT AND FIND THE STONE
TRULY IT MUST BE DELIGHTFUL BUT WHEN YOU BECOME AN INTEGRAL FIGURE IN SOCIETY SHE REALLY SAID INTEGRAL YOU ARE REGARDED AS INDISPENSABLE AND SOCIETY WON'T LET GO OF YOU
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE CAN'T WE SAID THE MAN BETWEEN HIS TEETH MORE CAN'T YOU NOW THEN WILL YOU THROW DOWN THAT SWORD NO SAID CAPEL FURIOUSLY YOU'VE WALKED INTO A TRAP SO GIVE UP
WHOM THE CAMPERS SURMISED CORRECTLY TO BE OLGA GRAHAM
AND LIVE CLOSE TO NATURE YOU KNOW
IN THE COOLEST MANNER POSSIBLE HE TOOK THE OTHER'S PLACE
THE TREMBLING MAN TOOK THE LANTERN WHILE HIS LEADER WENT DOWN ON ONE KNEE
WE'D LIKE TO WELL ENOUGH YOU KNOW BUT WE'RE IN SOCIETY SO MUCH THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE TIME KATHERINE WANTED TO ASK THE GRAHAM GIRLS IF THEY WERE GOING TO A STYLISH RECEPTION BEFORE BREAKFAST
THAT'S STRANGE COMMENTED THE OLDER OF THE VISITORS MAYBE IT'S THE GHOST SUGGESTED OLGA WITH A FAINT SMILE GHOST REPEATED SEVERAL OF THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS IN UNISON
AND NOT WITHOUT EMITTING A LOUD NOISE THE WORK OF CUTTING BEGAN THE SAWDUST FALLING LIGHTLY ON THE LION'S SKIN BUT AT THE END OF A FEW SECONDS A DULL HARSH SOUND
IT MUST BE SOMEBODY ESCAPED FROM A LUNATIC ASYLUM I SAW SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS MOVING THROUGH THE WOODS NEAR OUR COTTAGE ONE NIGHT ADDIE GRAHAM INTERPOSED AT THIS POINT
MAY ENTIRELY BE FORGOTTEN I GIVE AND BEQUEATH TO HIM FOR HIS SOLE USE AND ENJOYMENT AND IN THE HOPE THAT WITH THE HELP AND ADVICE OF MY OLD FRIEND JOSHUA GIRTLE HE WILL SENSIBLY INVEST
INTELLECT WAS HIS GOD AMBITION HIS MOTIVE POWER WHAT WOULD THIS CASUAL BLIGHT UPON HIS SUPREME CONTENTMENT BE TO HIM WHEN WITH THE WINGS OF HIS AIR CAR SPREAD HE SHOULD SPURN THE EARTH
AND THEN HAD COME UP AGAINST THIS LOVE WHEN HE THOUGHT SUCH FOLLY DEAD REMORSE WHEN GLORY CALLED FOR THE QUIET MIND AND HEART HE RECOGNISED ITS MORDANT FANG AND KNEW THAT ITS RAVAGES
LEAPED TO HIS FEET AT THAT MOMENT THE LIGHT WAS TURNED OFF AND THERE WAS A RUSH MADE TO GET BEYOND HIS REACH
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO THE GRAHAM GIRLS CALL THEY'RE EARLY RISERS WE MUST SAY THAT MUCH FOR THEM OBSERVED KATHERINE IN A LOW VOICE WE MUST GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR NOT LYING IN BED UNTIL TEN O'CLOCK
DON'T YOU GIRLS CAMP OUT ANY KATHERINE ASKED WITH THE VIEW OF POSSIBLY BRINGING OUT AN EXPLANATION OF THE GRAHAM GIRLS ATTIRE WHICH SEEMED SUITED MORE FOR PROMENADING ALONG
THERE IS NO OTHER EXPLANATION POSSIBLE FOR THIS ACT OSWALD BITTER AS IT IS FOR ME TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT I AM THUS FAR GUILTY OF THIS BELOVED WOMAN'S DEATH BUT
IN A DREAM AS THE LAWYER WENT ON
HE ABRUPTLY EXCLAIMED SPEAK I AM BOUND TO LISTEN YOU ARE MY BROTHER ORLANDO TURNED TOWARDS DORIS SHE WAS SLIPPING AWAY
THAT A TESTATOR HAS A PERFECT RIGHT TO DO WHAT HE LIKES WITH HIS OWN THEN YOU INFLUENCED HIM CRIED ARTIS FURIOUSLY I SHALL DISPUTE THE WILL THE OLD GENTLEMAN SMILED
THEN THE LIGHT SHONE FULL ON THE LOCK FOR A MINUTE OR TWO NOT MORE FOR HE WHO HELD IT KEPT TURNING HIS HEAD
GLISTENING DISC OF LIGHT SEEMED TO HAVE DARTED BACK TO THE SIDE OF THE BED HALF STUNNED BUT FULL OF FIGHT
RISING SUPERIOR TO THE OVERTHROW OF ALL HIS HOPES FOR A WOMAN OF EDITH'S PRINCIPLE TO SEEK DEATH IN A MOMENT OF DESPERATION THE PROVOCATION MUST HAVE BEEN VERY GREAT
RAMO DID NOT MOVE OR UTTER A WORD TO MY OLD FRIEND AND ADVISER JOSHUA GIRTLE OF THE INNER TEMPLE THE PLAIN GOLD SIGNET RING ON THE FOURTH FINGER OF MY LEFT HAND
AND IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER FOR YOU TO LET HIM DO THE WORK THAN TO PERFORM SUCH A LABORIOUS TASK YOURSELVES THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH
TOLD THAT THE SAW WAS MEETING METAL AND A FRESH START HAD TO BE MADE FOR FULLY TWO HOURS DID THE MEN WORK TO GET THROUGH BORING AND SAWING IN PLACE AFTER PLACE
THEN DEATH FOLLOWS THE IMPULSE WHICH GIVEN AN INSTANT OF THOUGHT WOULD HAVE VANISHED IN A BACK SWEEP OF OTHER EMOTIONS CHANCE WAS THE REAL ACCESSORY TO THIS DEATH BY SUICIDE OSWALD
BUT SHE MISTOOK MY PURPOSE AND AND WHAT ORLANDO HESITATED EVEN HIS IRON NATURE TREMBLED BEFORE THE MISERY HE SAW A MISERY HE WAS DESTINED TO AUGMENT RATHER THAN SOOTHE
NOBODY ELSE IN THE FAMILY WOULD BELIEVE ME WHEN I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT IT LOOKED LIKE A MAN IN A LONG WHITE ROBE AND LONG HAIR AND A LONG WHITE BEARD IT WAS MOONLIGHT AND I WAS LOOKING OUT OF MY BEDROOM WINDOW
THE OTHER GRAHAM GIRL DECLARED VENGEFULLY HAVEN'T YOU ANY IDEA WHO DID IT NONE THAT IS VERY TANGIBLE MISS LADD REPLIED
WOULD BE GLAD TO ASSIST YOU IN ANY WAY HE CAN I'M GOING TO SEND HIM DOWN HERE IF YOU SAY THE WORD TO HELP YOU EXTEND THAT ROPE AROUND YOUR SWIMMING PLACE HE'S A VERY HANDY BOY
THE CLOTHES LINE THEY HAD USED TO INDICATE THE SAFETY LIMITS OF THEIR BATHING PLACE
BUT ALWAYS TO FIND THAT THE DOOR WAS STRENGTHENED IN ALL DIRECTIONS WITH METAL PLATES AND AT LAST THE TASK WAS GIVEN UP LOOK HERE GROWLED THE LEADER OF THE PARTY THAT BED ISN'T USED
OSWALD THE TONE WAS CONTROLLING AND YET THAT OF ONE STRONG MAN TO ANOTHER IS IT FOR US TO READ THE HEART OF ANY WOMAN LEAST OF ALL OF A WOMAN OF HER SUSCEPTIBILITIES AND KEEN INNER LIFE
KNOW THAT THIS IS A STRANGE AND ARDUOUS BURDEN TO LAY UPON MY HEIR IN CHIEF
AND IT SHOULD GO MERRILY WITH HIM
AND SOAR INTO THE HEAVEN OF FAME SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH HIS FLIGHT INTO THE OPEN HE COULD WAIT FOR THAT HOUR HE HAD MEASURED THE GULF BEFORE HIM AND FOUND IT PASSABLE HENCEFORTH
THAT CENTERED ALL INTEREST IN UNAFFECTED EARNEST UPON THE LATEST DEPREDATION OF THEIR ENEMY OR ENEMIES WITH A STICK SHE FISHED OUT ONE END OF A SMALL ROPE
TELL ME IF I'M TO HATE YOU THROUGH LIFE YEA THROUGH ALL ETERNITY OR IF I MUST SEEK IN SOME UNIMAGINABLE FAILURE OF MY OWN CHARACTER OR CONDUCT THE CAUSE OF HER INTOLERABLE DESPAIR
IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT ASSOCIATE WITH THE FAMILY THAT HAD CUSTODY OF THE LITTLE BOY IN WHOSE INTERESTS THEY WERE WORKING ANY ATTEMPT ON THEIR PART THEY FELT TO DISCUSS SOCIETY
FROM MY MOUTH ONLY SHALL HE HEAR THE STERN AND SEEMINGLY UNNATURAL PART I PLAYED IN THIS FAMILY TRAGEDY THE FACE OF OSWALD HARDENED
WHEN THE CASES ARE TAKEN OUT THE KEYS OF WHICH AND THE SECRET OF THE LOCK
WHO HID CAPEL WITH HIS OWN HAND AS THE LIGHT WAS FLASHED UPON THE BED AND INTO THE CORNERS OF THE ROOM AND THEN TURNED OFF ALL RIGHT BOYS WAS WHISPERED
SON OF MY COUSIN WILLIAM ARTIS READ ON MISTER GIRTLE
LYDIA SANK BACK IN HER SEAT WITH A FEELING OF MISERY SHE COULD NOT HAVE EXPLAINED SEEMING TO CRUSH HER
SOMEHOW TILL WE'VE DONE HERE
HIS FEET BECAME ENTANGLED IN THE CURTAIN AND HE FELL HEAVILY WITH HIS ADVERSARY UPON HIM QUICK MORRIS WHISPERED A VOICE NO NO CURSE YOU SHUT THE WINDOW THERE'S ONLY ONE
NOW THEN SAID THE TALL MAN QUICKLY IT'S OF NO USE WE MUST GO DOWN
AND WELL I FELT THAT HE MIGHT THINK I WAS TRYING TO CURRY FAVOUR LET ME SEE MISTER ARTIS I THINK THE DECEASED DID PAY YOUR DEBTS IS THIS MEANT FOR AN INSULT SIR NO SIR
DRIVING THE THIRD BACK
WE WERE VERY MUCH INTERESTED WHEN WE LEARNED THAT A COMPANY OF CAMP FIRE GIRLS WERE CAMPING NEAR US
THEY MADE A HURRIED SEARCH OF THE ROOM BUT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SILVER TOPS OF THE BOTTLES OF THE COLONEL'S DRESSING CASE THERE WAS NOTHING TO EXCITE THEIR CUPIDITY THEN CAPEL'S POCKETS WERE SEARCHED
IT WAS A BUSINESS LIKE DEFENCE OF MY OLD FRIEND'S MEMORY TO PROCEED
AND THEN THE OLD SOLICITOR ROSE THE SERVANTS SLOWLY LEFT THE ROOM MAKING A DETOUR SO AS TO BOW AND COURTESY TO THE COLONEL'S HEIR
THEN THERE WAS THE FAINT STREAK OF LIGHT AS A MATCH WAS STRUCK THE BULL'S EYE LANTERN WAS PICKED UP AND RE LIT AND THE BRIGHT RAYS ONCE MORE PLAYED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM
SAID ARTIS IN AN AUDIBLE VOICE AND AS I BEING NOW IN FULL POSSESSION OF MY SENSES CONTINUED MISTER GIRTLE SLIGHTLY RAISING HIS VOICE
OF THE TESTATOR'S IMMENSE WEALTH AND GLANCED AT KATRINE I SHALL NOT GET ALL HE THOUGHT
OF THE SAID FREEHOLD AS ABOVE NAMED
AND THE SILENCE GREW HEAVY IT WAS BROKEN WHEN IT WAS BROKEN BY A CRY FROM OSWALD
TO HIM I LEAVE THE REST THIS DONE
BUT ANOTHER LOOK AT OSWALD AND HE WAS READY TO DO HIS BIDDING THE BITTER ORDEAL WAS OVER LET HIM HAVE HIS SOLACE
FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE GRAHAM GIRLS MUST RESULT IN A BETRAYAL OF THEIR UTTER LACK OF SYMPATHY WITH THIS SOCIAL INDISPENSABILITY OF SUCH HELPLESS SOCIETY VICTIMS
BOW REVERENTLY TAKE HIS HAND AND KISS IT SAYING SOFTLY THE ONE WORD SAHIB DON'T GO RAMO SAID MISTER GIRTLE AND THE OLD INDIAN SLOWLY BACKED INTO THE CORNER BY THE DOOR
ONLY A FOOL WOULD IGNORE THESE STEEPS OF JAGGED ROCK AND HE WAS NO FOOL ONLY A MAN TO WHOM THE UNEXPECTED HAD HAPPENED A MAN WHO HAD SEEN HIS WAY CLEAR TO THE HORIZON
AND ITS SHARP EDGE INSERTED BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE POST BUT THE GREAT SOLID MAHOGANY DOOR STOOD FIRM ONLY EMITTING NOW AND THEN A LOUD CRACK SHARP AS THAT GIVEN BY A CART WHIP
BUT AS THE THIRD FELLOW CAUGHT HIM BY THE WRIST THE YOUNG MAN WRENCHED HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HEAVED HIMSELF UP SO THAT HE PARTIALLY DISLODGED THE RUFFIAN WHO HELD HIM DOWN
WE'D LIKE HOWEVER TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU IN YOUR UNFORTUNATE SITUATION ADDIE GRAHAM CONTINUED WITH A GUSH OF SEEMING FRIENDLINESS I'M SURE MY BROTHER JAMES HE'S SIXTEEN YEARS OLD
THIS BROUGHT FORTH A TORRENT OF WHISPERED OATHS FROM BOTH MEN HERE LET ME HAVE A TRY WHISPERED THE LITTLE MAN I CAN OPEN IT IF YOU'LL HOLD THIS BLESSED GLIM STILL I NEVER SEE SUCH A CUR THEN
YOU KNOW DID ANYBODY EVER SEE IT ASKED HAZEL EDWARDS NOT THAT I KNOW
I THOUGHT SHE DESPISED MY COUNTRY BIRTH MY MECHANICAL ATTEMPTS MY LACK OF ARISTOCRATIC PRETENSIONS AND TRADITIONS
AND A MAN SWUNG HIMSELF INTO THE ROOM BE QUICK AND SHUT THE WINDOW A SECOND MAN CREPT SOFTLY IN AND THE THIRD WAS HALF IN WHEN HE SLIPPED THREW OUT HIS HAND TO SAVE HIMSELF
ORLANDO I BELIEVE IN GOD THEN SEEK YOUR COMFORT THERE I FIND IT IN HARNESSING THE WINDS IN FORCING THE POWERS OF NATURE TO DO MY BIDDING
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS PER ANNUM FOR THE REST OF HIS NATURAL LIFE THE SAME TO BE SECURED IN THREE PER CENT CONSOLS REVERTING AT HIS DEATH AS HEREINAFTER STATED
AND I HERE SOLEMNLY BIND MY HEIR AND SUCCESSOR TO OBSERVE EXACTLY THESE MY COMMANDS THAT MY BODY MAY REST UNDISTURBED IN MY OLD HOME UNDER PENALTY OF FORFEITURE
AS THE MEN STRAINED AT IT IN TURN HERE LET'S TRY A SAW CENTRE BIT A CENTRE BIT WAS FITTED INTO A STOCK AND A HOLE CUT RIGHT THROUGH INTO THIS AFTER MUCH GREASING
AND ONE HUNDRED POUNDS FREE OF DUTY TO BUY MOURNING THERE WHAT DID I TELL YOU SAID KATRINE IN A LOW SWEET VOICE AS SHE SMILED AT HER COMPANIONS TO GERARD ARTIS
THEIR PLAN WAS TO BRING ABOUT AN APPEARANCE OF FRIENDSHIP
WHISPERED THE SHIVERING EX SERVANT FAINT FROM HIS WOUND
HE WAS ALONE WITH HIS PAST HIS PRESENT AND HIS FUTURE ALONE HE NEEDED TO BE THE STRONGEST MUST PAUSE WHEN THE PRECIPICE YAWNS BEFORE HIM THE GULF CAN BE SPANNED
AND AS HE LAY BACK WITH THE MAN ON HIS CHEST HALF STUNNED HELPLESS AND DESPAIRING HE SAW INDISTINCTLY THE FIGURE AGAINST THE WINDOW HEARD THE SASH SLIDE DOWN AND THE DARKNESS WAS COMPLETE
RETURNED MISS LADD WITH A WARMTH THAT SEEMED TO INDICATE ACCEPTANCE OF THE OFFER THE TRUTH WAS THAT ANYTHING WHICH TENDED TO INCREASE
SUDDENLY THIS STRANGE BEING APPEARED NEAR THE EDGE OF THE TIMBER
THERE WAS A CLICK DIRECTLY AFTER AND THEN FROM ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM THE DAZZLING LIGHT OF THE BULL'S EYE SHONE OUT
AND SELL AND INVEST THE RUSSIAN LEATHER CASE CONTAINING BANK OF ENGLAND NOTES AMOUNTING TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS ARTIS DREW A LONG BREATH THROUGH HIS TEETH
AND NOT ONE OF THEM WOULD EVER ATTAIN THE DELIGHTS EACH WAS SO FITTED TO ENJOY WHY SHOULDN'T HE LAUGH WHAT IS LEFT TO MAN BUT MOCKERY WHEN ALL PROPS FALL DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THE UNIVERSAL LOT
IT SHOULD BE BUT A TURN A MAN'S JOYS ARE NOT BOUNDED BY HIS LOVES OR EVEN BY THE SATISFACTION OF A PERFECTLY UNTRAMMELLED MIND
THE DOORWAY SHALL THEN BE BUILT UP WITH BLOCKS OF STONE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF WHICH I HAD THE ROOM BUILT A SUFFICIENCY OF WHICH ARE STORED UP IN CELLAR NUMBER FOUR SEALED WITH MY SEAL
AND PROCEEDED DELIBERATELY TO WIPE THEM THE SERVANTS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE GLOOM WHERE THEY SAT TO GIVE EACH OTHER A CONGRATULATORY SHAKE OF THE HAND I NOW COME TO THE IMPORTANT BEQUESTS SAID MISTER GIRTLE
RAISING THE SWORD HE STRUCK AGAIN BUT AS HE DID SO ONE OF THE MEN SPRANG AT HIM AND THE BLOW THAT FELL WAS UPON THE FELLOW'S SHOULDER AND WITH THE HILT OF THE SWORD
THAT THERE MAY BE NO MISTAKE ONE HUNDRED POUNDS EACH TO MISS D'ENGHIEN AND MYSELF IT IS ABSURD PALTRY PITIFUL YOU NEVER SAW THE TESTATOR MISTER ARTIS NO SIR
ADDIE THAT'S MY SISTER HAD THE LAUGH ON US ALL AFTER THAT DO YOU LIVE IN THE COTTAGE OVER THERE ETHEL ZIMMERMAN INQUIRED POINTING TOWARD GRAHAM SUMMER RESIDENCE YES ADDIE REPLIED
NOTHING BUT THE STERN LANGUAGE SUITABLE TO THE STERN FACT HE WISHED TO IMPART WOULD LEAVE HIS LIPS AND ENDED THE PITIFUL STRUGGLE OF THE MOMENT WITH ONE QUICK UNPREMEDITATED BLOW WAS WHAT HE SAID
THERE WAS A BUZZ OF CONGRATULATION HERE AS THE OLD SOLICITOR ONCE MORE WIPED HIS GLASSES AND ARRANGED THEM AND THE CANDLES WHILE IN SPITE OF HIS ENDEAVOURS TO PRESERVE HIS CALMNESS
IS THERE A CRAZY MAN RUNNING LOOSE AROUND HERE ERNESTINE JOHANSON INQUIRED WITH A SHUDDER THERE MUST BE OLGA DECLARED WITH A SUGGESTION OF AWE IN HER VOICE
MARION STANLOCK INQUIRED WE LOOKED AROUND SPECIALLY TO FIND OUT IF THERE WERE ANY OTHERS NEAR BUT DIDN'T FIND ANY
WE HAD ROPED IN A BATHING PLACE AFTER EXAMINING IT AND FINDING IT SAFE FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT GOOD SWIMMERS AND YOU SEE WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WITH OUR WORK THE STAKES WERE PULLED UP AND THE ROPE HIDDEN IN THE WATER
I HAD SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED WITHOUT RELIGIOUS RITE OR CEREMONY OF ANY KIND
AND TURN TO WHAT REMAINS TO US OF LIFE AND LABOUR WORK IS GRIEF'S ONLY CONSOLATION THEN LET US WORK BUT OF ALL THIS OSWALD HAD CAUGHT BUT THE ONE WORD CHANCE HE REPEATED
WHICH WAS ALL SWEETNESS NOW SHE CONTINUED HER SOCIAL DISCOURSE THUS
WHERE'S YOUR MATCHES QUICK LIGHT THE GLIM AH WOULD YOU LIE STILL AND BITE THAT YOU JUST MOVE AGAIN AND I'LL PULL THE TRIGGER THE BARREL OF A REVOLVER HAD BEEN THRUST BETWEEN CAPEL'S TEETH
I DID SIR ONE HUNDRED POUNDS TO BUY MOURNING WHAT TREAT ME WORSE THAN HIS SERVANTS I BELIEVE MISTER ARTIS IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME
I LEAVE MY FREEHOLD HOUSE AND FURNITURE LIBRARY PLATE PICTURES STATUES BRONZES AND CURIOS
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO A BLANK ADVENTURE THE LIGHT PLAYED ON THE BLADE OF THE KEEN EDGED SWORD AS IF IT WERE PHOSPHORESCENT BUT THE LAMBENT QUIVERING WAS NOT SEEN BY THE HOLDER OF THE LANTERN
THE WISH TO END ALL COMES TO SOME NATURES LIKE A LIGHTNING FLASH FROM A CLEAR SKY IT COMES IT GOES OFTEN WITHOUT LEAVING A SIGN BUT IF A WEAPON CHANCES TO BE NEAR HERE IT WAS IN HAND
THAT THERE WAS A NEIGHBORHOOD STORY BEHIND IT FORCED UPON HER IMAGINATION AN
I SHOULD BUT INSULT YOUR GRIEF BY ANY LENGTHY EXPRESSIONS OF REGRET AND SORROW A GROAN OF INTOLERABLE ANGUISH FROM THE SICK MAN'S LIPS AND THEN THE QUICK THRUST
SAID THE LITTLE MAN IF YOU WANT TO PREACH JUST WAIT TILL THIS JOB'S DONE THROW THE LIGHT ON THE DOOR DICK
A METROPOLITAN BOULEVARD THAN FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE
JOSHUA GIRTLE WHOM I CONSTITUTE MY SOLE EXECUTOR
THAT'S IT IS IT QUIET WILL YOU HE STOOD LISTENING ATTENTIVELY IT'S ALL RIGHT THERE ISN'T A SOUND LET'S GO THEN AT ONCE WHAT EMPTY
THE AIR CAR COULD WAIT HE WOULD FIRST HAVE HIS HOUR IN THIS SOLITUDE OF HIS OWN MAKING THE GAZE HE DREADED THE WORDS FROM WHICH HE SHRANK COULD NOT PENETRATE HERE HE MIGHT EVEN SHOUT HER NAME ALOUD
BUT SHE WAS GONE SLOWLY HE TURNED BACK OSWALD RAISED HIS HAND AND CHECKED THE WORDS WITH WHICH HE WOULD HAVE BEGUN HIS STORY
AS GOD HEARS ME FROM THE MOMENT I FIRST SAW HER TO THE MOMENT I SAW HER LAST I DID NOT KNOW NOR DID I FOR A MOMENT DREAM THAT SHE WAS ANYTHING TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER MAN OF MY STAMP AND STATION
JUST ABOUT WHERE SHE SAID THE STONE THAT WAS THROWN AT HER FELL
AND CONTINUED THE OLD LAWYER THE FLAT SILVER CASE CONTAINING THE DIAMONDS PEARLS RUBIES AND EMERALDS BEQUEATHED TO ME BY MY MISTRESSES
IN RESPECT OF WHOSE SERVICES
TO KATRINE LEVEILLEE D'ENGHIEN
ORLANDO BROTHERSON DESPAIR WHILE HIS GREAT WORK LAY UNFINISHED THAT WOULD BE TO LAY STRESS ON THE INEVITABLE PAINS AND FEARS OF COMMONPLACE HUMANITY HE WAS NOT OF THAT ILK
ORLANDO UPON LEAVING HIS BROTHER'S ROOM DID NOT STOP TO DELIVER THAT BROTHER'S MESSAGE DIRECTLY TO DORIS HE LEFT THIS FOR TRUDA TO DO AND RETIRED IMMEDIATELY TO HIS HANGAR IN THE WOODS
WHICH WAS IN THE CUSTOMARY FORM AND BEGAN WITH A SERIES OF BEQUESTS
THOUGH ONLY JUST BEGUN WOULD LAST HIS LIFETIME NOTHING COULD STOP THEM NOW NOTHING NOTHING AND HE LAUGHED AS THE THOUGHT WENT HOME LAUGHED AT THE IRONY OF FATE
KEEP THAT LIGHT STILL WILL YOU HE CRIED MENACINGLY WHY
LAWRENCE MY GRAND NIECE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS FREE OF DUTY THE SAME TO BE INVESTED IN CONSOLS AND IF SHE MARRIES TO BE SECURED BY MARRIAGE SETTLEMENTS TO HERSELF AND CHILDREN
THE LITTLE MAN TOOK A BUNCH FROM THE BAG BUT
THE MAN WHO HELD IT THEN WENT TO THE DOOR AND LISTENED IT'S ALL RIGHT HE WHISPERED YOU SAID NOBODY CAN'T HEAR WHAT GOES ON IN THIS ROOM THESE CURTAINS WOULD SUFFOCATE A TRUMPET HERE YOU HE CRIED TO THE THIRD MAN
NOW THAT I KNOW SHE HAD OTHER REASONS FOR HER CONTEMPT THAT THE WORDS SHE WROTE WERE IN REBUKE TO THE BROTHER RATHER THAN TO THE MAN I FEEL MY GUILT AND DEPLORE MY ANGER I CANNOT SAY MORE
THE BLADE FELL HEAVILY UPON THE LANTERN AND DASHED IT TO THE FLOOR
THE GRANDNEPHEW OF MISSUS HUTCHINS LATE HUSBAND IN WHOSE INTERESTS THEY MADE THE PRESENT TRIP OF INSPECTION WHETHER OR NOT SHE RECOGNIZED AMONG THE CAMPERS THE TWO GIRLS TO WHOM SHE HAD BEHAVED SO RUDELY ON THAT OCCASION
DURING HIS LIFETIME IN THE SAME STATE
WHO FELT A CURIOUS OPPRESSION AT THE CHEST I NEVER SAW MY GREAT UNCLE I NEVER EVEN HEARD FROM OR WROTE TO HIM MAY I ASK WHY I KNEW HE WAS REPORTED TO BE IMMENSELY RICH
