AND HE HAD ONLY HIS OWN COMFORT TO SEEK AND HIS OWN SITUATION TO IMPROVE AS HE COULD A COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE BECAME DESIRABLE HE QUITTED THE MILITIA AND ENGAGED IN TRADE
AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY
WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING
ENOUGH TO SECURE THE PURCHASE OF A LITTLE ESTATE ADJOINING HIGHBURY WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS LONGED FOR ENOUGH TO MARRY A WOMAN AS PORTIONLESS EVEN AS MISS TAYLOR
WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME
THAT THE EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE AND THE SUPPER TABLE WHICH ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE
WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY HE WAS A MUCH OLDER MAN IN WAYS THAN IN YEARS AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER
EVERY DAY MAKING ME LESS FIT TO BEAR ANY OTHER PLACE HAPPY THOSE WHO CAN REMAIN AT HIGHBURY AS YOU DO US SUCH AMPLE JUSTICE NOW SAID EMMA LAUGHING I WILL VENTURE TO ASK WHETHER YOU DID NOT COME A LITTLE DOUBTFULLY AT FIRST
BETWEEN THEM IT WAS MORE THE INTIMACY OF SISTERS EVEN BEFORE MISS TAYLOR HAD CEASED TO HOLD THE NOMINAL OFFICE OF GOVERNESS
HATING CHANGE OF EVERY KIND MATRIMONY AS THE ORIGIN OF CHANGE WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET RECONCILED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING
AND ANIMATED MISTER WOODHOUSE FOR SOME TIME MISTER KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER WHICH ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER POOR ISABELLA AND HER CHILDREN WERE ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY WHEN THIS WAS OVER MISTER WOODHOUSE GRATEFULLY OBSERVED
AND WHILE HIS HOSPITALITY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING
AFTER THESE CAME A SECOND SET AMONG THE MOST COME AT ABLE OF WHOM WERE MISSUS AND MISS BATES AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD
AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN
THE TWO LADIES LOOKED OVER IT TOGETHER AND HE SAT SMILING AND TALKING TO THEM THE WHOLE TIME IN A VOICE A LITTLE SUBDUED BUT VERY AUDIBLE TO EVERY BODY WELL HE IS COMING YOU SEE GOOD NEWS I THINK WELL WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT
AND THE SHADOW OF AUTHORITY BEING NOW LONG PASSED AWAY THEY HAD BEEN LIVING TOGETHER AS FRIEND AND FRIEND VERY MUTUALLY ATTACHED AND EMMA DOING JUST WHAT SHE LIKED HIGHLY ESTEEMING MISS TAYLOR'S JUDGMENT BUT DIRECTED CHIEFLY BY HER OWN
THERE WAS NO RECOVERING MISS TAYLOR NOR MUCH LIKELIHOOD OF CEASING TO PITY HER BUT A FEW WEEKS BROUGHT SOME ALLEVIATION TO MISTER WOODHOUSE THE COMPLIMENTS OF HIS NEIGHBOURS WERE OVER
HOW SHE HAD DEVOTED ALL HER POWERS
SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN AND HOW IMPORTANT TO HER TO BE SECURE OF A COMFORTABLE PROVISION
AND SOCIAL TEMPER BY ENTERING INTO THE MILITIA OF HIS COUNTY THEN EMBODIED CAPTAIN WESTON WAS A GENERAL FAVOURITE AND WHEN THE CHANCES OF HIS MILITARY LIFE HAD INTRODUCED HIM TO MISS CHURCHILL OF A GREAT YORKSHIRE FAMILY
SHE HAD MANY ACQUAINTANCE IN THE PLACE FOR HER FATHER WAS UNIVERSALLY CIVIL BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS
AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY
YOU EMMA WHO HAVE SO FEW OPPORTUNITIES OF DANCING YOU ARE REALLY OUT OF LUCK YOU ARE VERY MUCH OUT OF LUCK IT WAS SOME DAYS BEFORE SHE SAW JANE FAIRFAX TO JUDGE OF HER HONEST REGRET IN THIS WOEFUL CHANGE BUT WHEN THEY DID MEET HER COMPOSURE WAS ODIOUS
AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY
HOW WAS SHE TO BEAR THE CHANGE IT WAS TRUE THAT HER FRIEND WAS GOING ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM BUT EMMA WAS AWARE THAT GREAT MUST BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MISSUS WESTON ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE
WHEN IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS NEW MOTHER ON THE OCCASION FOR A FEW DAYS EVERY MORNING VISIT IN HIGHBURY INCLUDED SOME MENTION OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISSUS WESTON HAD RECEIVED
AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER HE COULD NOT MEET HER IN CONVERSATION
I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE WHO CRIED MOST AH POOR MISS TAYLOR TIS A SAD BUSINESS
ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY THAT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER THING I DARE SAY MISTER KNIGHTLEY WILL BE SO KIND AS TO MEET HIM WITH A GREAT DEAL OF PLEASURE SIR AT ANY TIME SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY LAUGHING
THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS
EMMA NEVER THINKS OF HERSELF IF SHE CAN DO GOOD TO OTHERS REJOINED MISTER WOODHOUSE UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART
IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE
SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES IN TALKING AND LISTENING AND FORMING ALL THESE SCHEMES IN THE IN BETWEENS THAT THE EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE AND THE SUPPER TABLE WHICH
MISTER WESTON HOWEVER TOO EAGER TO BE VERY OBSERVANT TOO COMMUNICATIVE TO WANT OTHERS TO TALK WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH WHAT SHE DID SAY
THERE IS HARDLY ANY DESIRING TO REFRESH SUCH A MEMORY AS THAT SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY FEELINGLY AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE HAD DONE BUT I HE SOON ADDED WHO HAVE HAD NO SUCH CHARM THROWN OVER MY SENSES
EMMA MUST DO HARRIET GOOD AND BY SUPPLYING HER WITH A NEW OBJECT OF INTEREST HARRIET MAY BE SAID TO DO EMMA GOOD I HAVE BEEN SEEING THEIR INTIMACY WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE HOW VERY DIFFERENTLY WE FEEL NOT THINK THEY WILL DO EACH OTHER ANY GOOD
THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER
AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES HAD IT TAKEN PLACE ONLY ONCE A YEAR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRIEVANCE
I OBSERVE SHE ALWAYS TURNS THE LOCK OF THE DOOR THE RIGHT WAY AND NEVER BANGS IT I AM SURE SHE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT AND IT WILL BE A GREAT COMFORT TO POOR MISS TAYLOR TO HAVE SOMEBODY ABOUT HER THAT SHE IS USED TO SEE WHENEVER JAMES GOES OVER TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER YOU KNOW SHE WILL BE HEARING OF US
SHE LOVED EVERY BODY WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER
NOR FROM MISSING THE LUXURIES OF HER FORMER HOME
AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE EMMA IN LOVE AND IN SOME DOUBT OF A RETURN IT WOULD DO HER GOOD BUT THERE IS NOBODY HEREABOUTS TO ATTACH HER AND SHE GOES SO SELDOM FROM HOME THERE DOES INDEED
AND HAD LIVED NEARLY TWENTY ONE YEARS IN THE WORLD WITH VERY LITTLE TO DISTRESS OR VEX HER SHE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE TWO DAUGHTERS OF A MOST AFFECTIONATE INDULGENT FATHER AND HAD IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER SISTER'S MARRIAGE
THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS
MISTER WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT OH NO MISTER WESTON CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN SOME PEOPLE EVEN TALKED OF A PROMISE TO HIS WIFE ON HER DEATHBED
RATIONAL OR PLAYFUL THE EVIL OF THE ACTUAL DISPARITY IN THEIR AGES AND MISTER WOODHOUSE HAD NOT MARRIED EARLY WAS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HABITS FOR HAVING BEEN A VALETUDINARIAN ALL HIS LIFE
WHEN THE LADIES RETURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER EMMA FOUND IT HARDLY POSSIBLE TO PREVENT THEIR MAKING TWO DISTINCT PARTIES WITH SO MUCH PERSEVERANCE IN JUDGING AND BEHAVING ILL DID MISSUS ELTON ENGROSS JANE FAIRFAX AND SLIGHT HERSELF
MATRIMONY AS THE ORIGIN OF CHANGE WAS ALWAYS DISAGREEABLE AND HE WAS BY NO MEANS YET RECONCILED TO HIS OWN DAUGHTER'S MARRYING NOR COULD EVER SPEAK OF HER BUT WITH COMPASSION THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION
AND SOON MOVED AWAY TO MAKE THE REST OF HIS FRIENDS HAPPY BY A PARTIAL COMMUNICATION OF WHAT THE WHOLE ROOM MUST HAVE OVERHEARD ALREADY IT WAS WELL THAT HE TOOK EVERY BODY'S JOY FOR GRANTED OR HE MIGHT NOT HAVE THOUGHT EITHER MISTER WOODHOUSE OR MISTER KNIGHTLEY PARTICULARLY DELIGHTED
BUT ON SUCCEEDING EARLY IN LIFE TO A SMALL INDEPENDENCE HAD BECOME INDISPOSED FOR ANY OF THE MORE HOMELY PURSUITS IN WHICH HIS BROTHERS WERE ENGAGED AND HAD SATISFIED AN ACTIVE CHEERFUL MIND
AND YOU MUST BE OFF THIS VERY MORNING YES MY FATHER IS TO JOIN ME HERE WE SHALL WALK BACK TOGETHER AND I MUST BE OFF IMMEDIATELY I AM ALMOST AFRAID THAT EVERY MOMENT WILL BRING HIM
BUT YOU WERE PREPARING YOURSELF TO BE AN EXCELLENT WIFE ALL THE TIME YOU WERE AT HARTFIELD YOU MIGHT NOT GIVE EMMA SUCH A COMPLETE EDUCATION AS YOUR POWERS WOULD SEEM TO PROMISE BUT YOU WERE RECEIVING A VERY GOOD EDUCATION FROM HER
BUT IF THIS REFLECTED AT ALL UPON HIS IMPATIENCE HIS SORROWFUL LOOK AND TOTAL WANT OF SPIRITS WHEN HE DID COME MIGHT REDEEM HIM HE FELT THE GOING AWAY ALMOST TOO MUCH TO SPEAK OF IT HIS DEJECTION WAS MOST EVIDENT HE SAT REALLY LOST IN THOUGHT FOR THE FIRST FEW MINUTES
ON COMING OF AGE IT WAS MOST UNLIKELY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD EVER WANT HIS FATHER'S ASSISTANCE HIS FATHER HAD NO APPREHENSION OF IT THE AUNT WAS A CAPRICIOUS WOMAN AND GOVERNED HER HUSBAND ENTIRELY
EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO THAT MISS TAYLOR AND I MET WITH HIM IN BROADWAY LANE WHEN BECAUSE IT BEGAN TO DRIZZLE HE DARTED AWAY WITH SO MUCH GALLANTRY AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT
THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT
AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY THAT IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO HAVE HIM SINGLE ANY LONGER AND I THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS JOINING THEIR HANDS TO DAY HE LOOKED SO VERY MUCH AS IF HE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME KIND OFFICE DONE FOR HIM
FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO OUTWARD RESPECT SHE HAD NEVER BOASTED EITHER BEAUTY OR CLEVERNESS
SHE KNEW IT WOULD BE SO MUCH LESS SO TO HER FATHER THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HIM REALLY SUSPECT SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE AS HER NOT BEING THOUGHT PERFECT BY EVERY BODY EMMA KNOWS I NEVER FLATTER HER SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL AND HELP AND RECOMMEND THE MINCED CHICKEN AND SCALLOPED OYSTERS WITH AN URGENCY WHICH SHE KNEW WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE
SHE WAS OUT AND I FELT IT IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO WAIT TILL SHE CAME IN SHE IS A WOMAN THAT ONE MAY THAT ONE MUST LAUGH AT BUT THAT ONE WOULD NOT WISH TO SLIGHT IT WAS BETTER TO PAY MY VISIT THEN HE HESITATED GOT UP WALKED TO A WINDOW
THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT I WANTED WELL PRETTY GOOD NEWS IS NOT IT HAVE YOU FINISHED IT HAS EMMA READ IT ALL PUT IT UP PUT IT UP WE WILL HAVE A GOOD TALK ABOUT IT SOME OTHER TIME BUT IT WILL NOT DO NOW
AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING WITH WHAT SELF DENYING GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED AND PROMOTED THE MATCH BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER THE WANT OF MISS TAYLOR WOULD BE FELT EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY
AH POOR MISS TAYLOR TIS A SAD BUSINESS POOR MISTER AND MISS WOODHOUSE IF YOU PLEASE BUT I CANNOT POSSIBLY SAY POOR MISS TAYLOR I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR YOU AND EMMA
NOT UNWILLING TO TALK AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD
AND SO APPARENT THAT EMMA WELL AS SHE KNEW HER FATHER WAS SOMETIMES TAKEN BY SURPRIZE
HE COULD COMMAND THE VISITS OF HIS OWN LITTLE CIRCLE IN A GREAT MEASURE AS HE LIKED HE HAD NOT MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH ANY FAMILIES BEYOND THAT CIRCLE HIS HORROR OF LATE HOURS AND LARGE DINNER PARTIES
SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT ALWAYS CHEERFUL MISTER WESTON NEED NOT SPEND A SINGLE EVENING IN THE YEAR ALONE IF HE DID NOT LIKE IT
TO BE THE INTIMATES OF A GIRL WHO WANTED ONLY A LITTLE MORE KNOWLEDGE AND ELEGANCE TO BE QUITE PERFECT SHE WOULD NOTICE HER SHE WOULD IMPROVE HER SHE WOULD DETACH HER FROM HER BAD ACQUAINTANCE AND INTRODUCE HER INTO GOOD SOCIETY
SUCCESS SUPPOSES ENDEAVOUR YOUR TIME HAS BEEN PROPERLY AND DELICATELY SPENT IF YOU HAVE BEEN ENDEAVOURING FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO BRING ABOUT THIS MARRIAGE A WORTHY EMPLOYMENT FOR A YOUNG LADY'S MIND
I HAVE SOME NOTION OF PUTTING SUCH A TRIMMING AS THIS TO MY WHITE AND SILVER POPLIN DO YOU THINK IT WILL LOOK WELL THE WHOLE PARTY WERE BUT JUST REASSEMBLED IN THE DRAWING ROOM WHEN MISTER WESTON MADE HIS APPEARANCE AMONG THEM
I SHOULD SUFFER MORE FROM COMPARISON A GENTLEMAN'S FAMILY IS ALL THAT I SHOULD CONDITION FOR I KNOW YOU I KNOW YOU YOU WOULD TAKE UP WITH ANY THING BUT I SHALL BE A LITTLE MORE NICE AND I AM SURE THE GOOD CAMPBELLS WILL BE QUITE ON MY SIDE
CERTAINLY HIS BEING AT RANDALLS HAD GIVEN GREAT SPIRIT TO THE LAST TWO WEEKS INDESCRIBABLE SPIRIT
AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO
WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT
I WISH YOU MAY NOT CATCH COLD DIRTY SIR LOOK AT MY SHOES NOT A SPECK ON THEM
THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT AND HAPPY WAS SHE FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE IN THE POWER THOUGH AS FAR AS SHE WAS HERSELF CONCERNED IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON
WE TALKED IT ALL OVER WITH MISTER WESTON LAST NIGHT AND AS FOR JAMES YOU MAY BE VERY SURE HE WILL ALWAYS LIKE GOING TO RANDALLS BECAUSE OF HIS DAUGHTER'S BEING HOUSEMAID THERE I ONLY DOUBT WHETHER HE WILL EVER TAKE US ANYWHERE ELSE THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA
HER FATHER AND HERSELF WERE LEFT TO DINE TOGETHER WITH NO PROSPECT OF A THIRD TO CHEER A LONG EVENING HER FATHER COMPOSED HIMSELF TO SLEEP AFTER DINNER AS USUAL
YOU KNOW I CANNOT MISTER WESTON IS SUCH A GOOD HUMOURED PLEASANT EXCELLENT MAN THAT HE THOROUGHLY DESERVES A GOOD WIFE AND YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MISS TAYLOR LIVE WITH US FOR EVER AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER OWN A HOUSE OF HER OWN
MUST STILL SEE HEAR AND REMEMBER EMMA IS SPOILED BY BEING THE CLEVEREST OF HER FAMILY AT TEN YEARS OLD SHE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHICH PUZZLED HER SISTER AT SEVENTEEN SHE WAS ALWAYS QUICK AND ASSURED
WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE
BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND AND THEIR LITTLE CHILDREN TO FILL THE HOUSE AND GIVE HER PLEASANT SOCIETY AGAIN HIGHBURY THE LARGE AND POPULOUS VILLAGE ALMOST AMOUNTING TO A TOWN
FACE AND FIGURE I
THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER
I DARE SAY MISTER KNIGHTLEY WILL BE SO KIND AS TO MEET HIM
WITH AN URGENCY WHICH SHE KNEW WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MISTER WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS YOUTH
MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME
OF FINISHING HIS DAY IN THE EFFORTS OF CIVILITY AND THE NOISE OF NUMBERS WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO STRIKE HIM DEEPLY A MAN WHO HAD BEEN IN MOTION SINCE EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN STILL WHO HAD BEEN LONG TALKING AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN SILENT
ONLY ONE MORE PAPA ONLY FOR MISTER ELTON POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM
AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY THE HAPPINESS OF MISS SMITH WAS QUITE EQUAL TO HER INTENTIONS MISS WOODHOUSE WAS SO GREAT A PERSONAGE IN HIGHBURY
HAVING BROTHERS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN A GOOD WAY IN LONDON WHICH AFFORDED HIM A FAVOURABLE OPENING IT WAS A CONCERN WHICH BROUGHT JUST EMPLOYMENT ENOUGH HE HAD STILL A SMALL HOUSE IN HIGHBURY
I THINK YOU MUST KNOW HARTFIELD ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND THAT A STRAIGHTFORWARD OPEN HEARTED MAN LIKE WESTON AND A RATIONAL UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS
EVERY BODY SAID THAT MISTER WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN OH DEAR NO MISTER WESTON WHO HAD BEEN A WIDOWER SO LONG
AND A RATIONAL UNAFFECTED WOMAN LIKE MISS TAYLOR MAY BE SAFELY LEFT TO MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DONE HARM TO YOURSELF THAN GOOD TO THEM BY INTERFERENCE
AND TO LIVE ACCORDING TO THE WISHES OF HIS OWN FRIENDLY AND SOCIAL DISPOSITION IT WAS NOW SOME TIME SINCE MISS TAYLOR HAD BEGUN TO INFLUENCE HIS SCHEMES BUT AS IT WAS NOT THE TYRANNIC INFLUENCE OF YOUTH ON YOUTH
BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS TILL HER FATHER AWOKE
THE REAL EVILS INDEED OF EMMA'S SITUATION WERE THE POWER OF HAVING RATHER TOO MUCH HER OWN WAY AND A DISPOSITION TO THINK A LITTLE TOO WELL OF HERSELF
AND I AGREE WITH YOU ENTIRELY THAT IT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER THING INVITE HIM TO DINNER EMMA AND HELP HIM TO THE BEST OF THE FISH AND THE CHICKEN
THE DANGER HOWEVER WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED THAT THEY DID NOT BY ANY MEANS RANK AS MISFORTUNES WITH HER SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED
MOST LIKELY THEY WILL BE THERE TO MORROW OR SATURDAY AS TO HER ILLNESS ALL NOTHING OF COURSE BUT IT IS AN EXCELLENT THING TO HAVE FRANK AMONG US AGAIN SO NEAR AS TOWN THEY WILL STAY A GOOD WHILE WHEN THEY DO COME AND HE WILL BE HALF HIS TIME WITH US
MY DEAREST PAPA YOU DO NOT THINK I COULD MEAN YOU OR SUPPOSE MISTER KNIGHTLEY TO MEAN YOU WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA OH NO I MEANT ONLY MYSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME YOU KNOW IN A JOKE IT IS ALL A JOKE
OH NO WE ALL FELT THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ONLY HALF A MILE APART AND WERE SURE OF MEETING EVERY DAY DEAR EMMA BEARS EVERY THING SO WELL SAID HER FATHER BUT MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHE IS REALLY VERY SORRY TO LOSE POOR MISS TAYLOR
HE LOOKED AT HER AS IF WANTING TO READ HER THOUGHTS SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY IT SEEMED LIKE THE FORERUNNER OF SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS WHICH SHE DID NOT WISH
FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER AND IN WINTER DRESSED THEIR CHILBLAINS WITH HER OWN HANDS IT WAS NO WONDER
SUCH A FORTNIGHT AS IT HAS BEEN HE CONTINUED
OR A KINDER SISTER OR A TRUER FRIEND NO NO SHE HAS QUALITIES WHICH MAY BE TRUSTED SHE WILL NEVER LEAD ANY ONE REALLY WRONG SHE WILL MAKE NO LASTING BLUNDER WHERE EMMA ERRS ONCE SHE IS IN THE RIGHT A HUNDRED TIMES
THE CARRIAGE BUT JAMES WILL NOT LIKE TO PUT THE HORSES TO FOR SUCH A LITTLE WAY AND WHERE ARE THE POOR HORSES TO BE WHILE WE ARE PAYING OUR VISIT THEY ARE TO BE PUT INTO MISTER WESTON'S STABLE PAPA YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
IN A FAMILY NOT MOVING IN A CERTAIN CIRCLE OR ABLE TO COMMAND THE ELEGANCIES OF LIFE YOU ARE VERY OBLIGING BUT AS TO ALL THAT I AM VERY INDIFFERENT IT WOULD BE NO OBJECT TO ME TO BE WITH THE RICH MY MORTIFICATIONS I THINK WOULD ONLY BE THE GREATER
SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF
ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY
NOT I INDEED I NEVER LOOK AT IT I DO NOT KNOW WHO DOES FINE DANCING I BELIEVE LIKE VIRTUE MUST BE ITS OWN REWARD THOSE WHO ARE STANDING BY ARE USUALLY THINKING OF SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THIS EMMA FELT WAS AIMED AT HER
JOHN KNIGHTLEY ONLY WAS IN MUTE ASTONISHMENT THAT A MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE SPENT HIS EVENING QUIETLY AT HOME AFTER A DAY OF BUSINESS IN LONDON SHOULD SET OFF AGAIN AND WALK HALF A MILE TO ANOTHER MAN'S HOUSE FOR THE SAKE OF BEING IN MIXED COMPANY TILL BED TIME
WITH YOUR SUPERIOR TALENTS YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO MOVE IN THE FIRST CIRCLE YOUR MUSICAL KNOWLEDGE ALONE WOULD ENTITLE YOU TO NAME YOUR OWN TERMS HAVE AS MANY ROOMS AS YOU LIKE AND MIX IN THE FAMILY AS MUCH AS YOU CHOSE THAT IS I DO NOT KNOW
SHE DID NOT CEASE TO LOVE HER HUSBAND BUT SHE WANTED AT ONCE TO BE THE WIFE OF CAPTAIN WESTON AND MISS CHURCHILL OF ENSCOMBE CAPTAIN WESTON WHO HAD BEEN CONSIDERED
YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
AS RENTING A LARGE FARM OF MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND RESIDING IN THE PARISH OF DONWELL VERY CREDITABLY SHE BELIEVED SHE KNEW MISTER KNIGHTLEY THOUGHT HIGHLY OF THEM BUT THEY MUST BE COARSE AND UNPOLISHED AND VERY UNFIT
WHERE MOST OF HIS LEISURE DAYS WERE SPENT AND BETWEEN USEFUL OCCUPATION AND THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY THE NEXT EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY HE HAD BY THAT TIME REALISED AN EASY COMPETENCE
HE THOUGHT PRINCIPALLY OF MISSUS CHURCHILL'S ILLNESS AND WANTED TO KNOW HOW SHE WAS TREATED AND AS FOR THE BALL IT WAS SHOCKING TO HAVE DEAR EMMA DISAPPOINTED BUT THEY WOULD ALL BE SAFER AT HOME EMMA WAS READY FOR HER VISITOR SOME TIME BEFORE HE APPEARED
I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ELTON AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I HAVE OF DOING HIM A SERVICE MISTER ELTON IS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN TO BE SURE AND A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN AND I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM
WHAT A HORRIBLE IDEA OH NO I MEANT ONLY MYSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY LOVES TO FIND FAULT WITH ME YOU KNOW IN A JOKE IT IS ALL A JOKE
DO YOU REALLY THINK IT A BAD THING WHY SO I THINK THEY WILL NEITHER OF THEM DO THE OTHER ANY GOOD
AND MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE
MISTER WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY HE LIKED VERY MUCH TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES FROM HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD AND HIS GOOD NATURE FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER
MISTER KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER WHICH ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER POOR ISABELLA AND HER CHILDREN WERE ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY WHEN THIS WAS OVER MISTER WOODHOUSE GRATEFULLY OBSERVED
WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE SAID MISTER WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN MAY COMFORT ME FOR ANY THING MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HER HER FATHER FONDLY REPLIED AH MY DEAR I WISH YOU WOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES AND FORETELL THINGS
OFFICES FOR THE SALE NOT QUITE OF HUMAN FLESH BUT OF HUMAN INTELLECT OH MY DEAR HUMAN FLESH YOU QUITE SHOCK ME IF YOU MEAN A FLING AT THE SLAVE TRADE I ASSURE YOU MISTER SUCKLING WAS ALWAYS RATHER A FRIEND TO THE ABOLITION
ISABELLA SLOW AND DIFFIDENT AND EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE EMMA HAS BEEN MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AND OF YOU ALL IN HER MOTHER SHE LOST THE ONLY PERSON ABLE TO COPE WITH HER SHE INHERITS HER MOTHER'S TALENTS AND MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER SUBJECTION TO HER
OR MY DREAD OF ITS DOING THEM BOTH HARM AND I MISTER KNIGHTLEY AM EQUALLY STOUT IN MY CONFIDENCE OF ITS NOT DOING THEM ANY HARM WITH ALL DEAR EMMA'S LITTLE FAULTS SHE IS AN EXCELLENT CREATURE WHERE SHALL WE SEE A BETTER DAUGHTER
THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM AND THE SMILES OF HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER WAS IN NO DANGER OF BEING THROWN AWAY AFTER THESE CAME A SECOND SET
YOU MAY WELL CLASS THE DELIGHT THE HONOUR AND THE COMFORT OF SUCH A SITUATION TOGETHER SAID JANE THEY ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE EQUAL HOWEVER I AM VERY SERIOUS IN NOT WISHING ANY THING TO BE ATTEMPTED AT PRESENT FOR ME
AND SOMEBODY HAD LATELY RAISED HER FROM THE CONDITION OF SCHOLAR TO THAT OF PARLOUR BOARDER THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN OF HER HISTORY SHE HAD NO VISIBLE FRIENDS BUT WHAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED AT HIGHBURY
AS RENTING A LARGE FARM OF MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND RESIDING IN THE PARISH OF DONWELL VERY CREDITABLY SHE BELIEVED SHE KNEW MISTER KNIGHTLEY THOUGHT HIGHLY OF THEM BUT THEY MUST BE COARSE AND UNPOLISHED
THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER THE FRIENDS FROM WHOM SHE HAD JUST PARTED THOUGH VERY GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE MUST BE DOING HER HARM THEY WERE A FAMILY OF THE NAME OF MARTIN
AND WAS CONSIDERED WITH ALL THE REGARD AND RESPECT WHICH A HARMLESS OLD LADY UNDER SUCH UNTOWARD CIRCUMSTANCES CAN EXCITE HER DAUGHTER ENJOYED A MOST UNCOMMON DEGREE OF POPULARITY FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG HANDSOME RICH NOR MARRIED
FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG HANDSOME RICH NOR MARRIED MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF
IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL
BEEN MISTRESS OF HIS HOUSE FROM A VERY EARLY PERIOD HER MOTHER HAD DIED TOO LONG AGO FOR HER TO HAVE MORE THAN AN INDISTINCT REMEMBRANCE OF HER CARESSES AND HER PLACE HAD BEEN SUPPLIED BY AN EXCELLENT WOMAN AS GOVERNESS
SEEM AS LITTLE TO TEMPT HER TO BREAK HER RESOLUTION AT PRESENT SAID MISSUS WESTON AS CAN WELL BE AND WHILE SHE IS SO HAPPY AT HARTFIELD I CANNOT WISH HER TO BE FORMING ANY ATTACHMENT WHICH WOULD BE CREATING SUCH DIFFICULTIES ON POOR MISTER WOODHOUSE'S ACCOUNT
I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA YOU CANNOT THINK THAT I SHALL LEAVE OFF MATCH MAKING I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BY SUCCESS SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
WHICH YET WAS NEVER INDIFFERENT TO THE CREDIT OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL
SHE WAS SHORT PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
THIS WRETCHED NOTE WAS THE FINALE OF EMMA'S BREAKFAST WHEN ONCE IT HAD BEEN READ THERE WAS NO DOING ANY THING BUT LAMENT AND EXCLAIM THE LOSS OF THE BALL THE LOSS OF THE YOUNG MAN AND ALL THAT THE YOUNG MAN MIGHT BE FEELING IT WAS TOO WRETCHED
THE EVENT HAD EVERY PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER FRIEND MISTER WESTON WAS A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER EASY FORTUNE SUITABLE AGE AND PLEASANT MANNERS
AND PERHAPS NO MAN CAN BE A GOOD JUDGE OF THE COMFORT A WOMAN FEELS IN THE SOCIETY OF ONE OF HER OWN SEX AFTER BEING USED TO IT ALL HER LIFE I CAN IMAGINE YOUR OBJECTION TO HARRIET SMITH SHE IS NOT THE SUPERIOR YOUNG WOMAN WHICH EMMA'S FRIEND OUGHT TO BE
VERY FOND OF BOTH DAUGHTERS BUT PARTICULARLY OF EMMA
I MAKE NO INQUIRY MYSELF AND SHOULD BE SORRY TO HAVE ANY MADE BY MY FRIENDS WHEN I AM QUITE DETERMINED AS TO THE TIME I AM NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF BEING LONG UNEMPLOYED THERE ARE PLACES IN TOWN OFFICES WHERE INQUIRY WOULD SOON PRODUCE SOMETHING
OH YOU WOULD RATHER TALK OF HER PERSON THAN HER MIND WOULD YOU VERY WELL I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY EMMA'S BEING PRETTY PRETTY SAY BEAUTIFUL RATHER CAN YOU IMAGINE ANY THING NEARER PERFECT BEAUTY THAN EMMA ALTOGETHER
THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS
THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF
OUR POOR BALL MUST BE QUITE GIVEN UP AH THAT BALL WHY DID WE WAIT FOR ANY THING WHY NOT SEIZE THE PLEASURE AT ONCE HOW OFTEN IS HAPPINESS DESTROYED BY PREPARATION FOOLISH PREPARATION YOU TOLD US IT WOULD BE SO
BUT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AS I HAVE YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY CANDIDATES THERE ALWAYS ARE FOR THE FIRST SITUATIONS I SAW A VAST DEAL OF THAT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ROUND MAPLE GROVE A COUSIN OF MISTER SUCKLING MISSUS BRAGGE
AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY NOT UNWILLING TO TALK
POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY
HE WAS SILENT SHE BELIEVED HE WAS LOOKING AT HER PROBABLY REFLECTING ON WHAT SHE HAD SAID AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE MANNER SHE HEARD HIM SIGH IT WAS NATURAL FOR HIM TO FEEL THAT HE HAD CAUSE TO SIGH HE COULD NOT BELIEVE HER TO BE ENCOURAGING HIM
PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
THESE WERE THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH THREATENED ALLOY TO HER MANY ENJOYMENTS THE DANGER HOWEVER WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED
SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT HE COULD WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY
AND HAD SENSE AND ENERGY AND SPIRITS THAT MIGHT BE HOPED WOULD BEAR HER WELL AND HAPPILY THROUGH ITS LITTLE DIFFICULTIES AND PRIVATIONS AND THEN THERE WAS SUCH COMFORT IN THE VERY EASY DISTANCE OF RANDALLS FROM HARTFIELD
BUT I CONFESS THAT I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A FACE OR FIGURE MORE PLEASING TO ME THAN HERS BUT I AM A PARTIAL OLD FRIEND SUCH AN EYE THE TRUE HAZLE EYE AND SO BRILLIANT REGULAR FEATURES
HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL AND SOMEBODY HAD LATELY RAISED HER FROM THE CONDITION OF SCHOLAR TO THAT OF PARLOUR BOARDER THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN OF HER HISTORY
QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING
AND WHEN ROUSING HIMSELF IT WAS ONLY TO SAY OF ALL HORRID THINGS LEAVE TAKING IS THE WORST BUT YOU WILL COME AGAIN SAID EMMA THIS WILL NOT BE YOUR ONLY VISIT TO RANDALLS AH SHAKING HIS HEAD
AND YET SHE WAS A HAPPY WOMAN AND A WOMAN WHOM NO ONE NAMED WITHOUT GOOD WILL IT WAS HER OWN UNIVERSAL GOOD WILL AND CONTENTED TEMPER WHICH WORKED SUCH WONDERS SHE LOVED EVERY BODY
MISSUS BATES THE WIDOW OF A FORMER VICAR OF HIGHBURY WAS A VERY OLD LADY ALMOST PAST EVERY THING BUT TEA AND QUADRILLE SHE LIVED WITH HER SINGLE DAUGHTER IN A VERY SMALL WAY
WHICH THOUGH PRINCIPALLY ADDRESSED TO MISSUS WESTON HE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST DOUBT OF BEING HIGHLY INTERESTING TO EVERY BODY IN THE ROOM HE GAVE HER A LETTER IT WAS FROM FRANK AND TO HERSELF HE HAD MET WITH IT IN HIS WAY AND HAD TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF OPENING IT
I WILL NOT RAISE ANY OUTCRY I WILL KEEP MY ILL HUMOUR TO MYSELF I HAVE A VERY SINCERE INTEREST IN EMMA ISABELLA DOES NOT SEEM MORE MY SISTER HAS NEVER EXCITED A GREATER INTEREST PERHAPS HARDLY SO GREAT
HER SITUATION WAS ALTOGETHER THE SUBJECT OF HOURS OF GRATITUDE TO MISSUS WESTON AND OF MOMENTS ONLY OF REGRET AND HER SATISFACTION HER MORE THAN SATISFACTION HER CHEERFUL ENJOYMENT WAS SO JUST
TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MISTER WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS YOUTH
OR ANY THING WHICH PROFESSED IN LONG SENTENCES OF REFINED NONSENSE TO COMBINE LIBERAL ACQUIREMENTS WITH ELEGANT MORALITY UPON NEW PRINCIPLES AND NEW SYSTEMS
AND FINALLY THE LAST AND HIGHEST PINNACLE DISAPPEARING
WHEN FAR DISTANT MY COMPANIONS KNEW THEM TO BE INDIANS BY THEIR LONG HAIR STREAMING BEHIND THEIR BACKS THE INDIANS GENERALLY HAVE A FILLET ROUND THEIR HEADS BUT NEVER ANY COVERING
ONE FANCIED THE CLIMATE EVEN WORSE THAN IT REALLY WAS WHILE GOING ONE DAY ON SHORE NEAR WOLLASTON ISLAND WE PULLED ALONGSIDE A CANOE WITH SIX FUEGIANS THESE WERE THE MOST ABJECT AND MISERABLE CREATURES I ANYWHERE BEHELD
ARE SHY AND WILD IN THE DUSK OF THE EVENING THEY LIVE ENTIRELY ON VEGETABLE MATTER THE ROCK GOOSE SO CALLED FROM LIVING EXCLUSIVELY ON THE SEA BEACH ANAS ANTARCTICA
THE GUIDE TOLD ME TO ASCEND THE NEAREST RIDGE WHICH HE THOUGHT WOULD LEAD ME TO THE FOUR PEAKS THAT CROWN THE SUMMIT THE CLIMBING UP SUCH ROUGH ROCKS WAS VERY FATIGUING
MY DISAPPOINTMENT WAS EXTREME IN FINDING A PRECIPITOUS VALLEY AS DEEP AS THE PLAIN WHICH CUT THE CHAIN TRANSVERSELY IN TWO AND SEPARATED ME FROM THE FOUR POINTS THIS VALLEY IS VERY NARROW
HOW FAR FROM THE PARENT ROCK ANY PEBBLES COULD BE FOUND ON THE SHORES OF BAHIA BLANCA AND NEAR THE SETTLEMENT THERE WERE SOME OF QUARTZ WHICH CERTAINLY MUST HAVE COME FROM THIS SOURCE
ALTHOUGH ALL THREE COULD BOTH SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND A GOOD DEAL OF ENGLISH IT WAS SINGULARLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN MUCH INFORMATION FROM THEM CONCERNING THE HABITS OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN THIS WAS PARTLY OWING TO THEIR APPARENT DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THE SIMPLEST ALTERNATIVE
WITH THEIR FOSSIL SHELLS OF THE PEUQUENES RANGE AND PARTLY OF RED POTASH GRANITE LIKE THAT OF THE PORTILLO HENCE WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT BOTH THE PEUQUENES AND PORTILLO RANGES WERE PARTIALLY UPHEAVED AND EXPOSED TO WEAR AND TEAR WHEN THE CONGLOMERATE WAS FORMING
HE SEEMED HIGHLY PLEASED THE LANGUAGE OF THESE PEOPLE ACCORDING TO OUR NOTIONS SCARCELY DESERVES TO BE CALLED ARTICULATE CAPTAIN COOK HAS COMPARED IT TO A MAN CLEARING HIS THROAT BUT CERTAINLY NO EUROPEAN EVER CLEARED HIS THROAT WITH SO MANY HOARSE GUTTURAL AND CLICKING SOUNDS
THE LOWER COUNTRY CONSISTS OF CLAY SLATE AND SANDSTONE
CONSIDERABLE TRACTS OF COUNTRY ARE SO COMPLETELY UNDERMINED BY THESE ANIMALS THAT HORSES IN PASSING OVER SINK ABOVE THEIR FETLOCKS THE TUCUTUCOS APPEAR TO A CERTAIN DEGREE TO BE GREGARIOUS
AT NIGHT WE SLEPT AT A COTTAGE OUR MANNER OF TRAVELLING WAS DELIGHTFULLY INDEPENDENT
I SUPPOSE MY HORSE FELL AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES AND SOMETIMES THE WHOLE SIX HORSES WERE FLOUNDERING IN THE MUD TOGETHER ALL THE LITTLE STREAMS ARE BORDERED BY SOFT PEAT
YET EVERY DAY SNOW FELL ON THE HILLS AND IN THE VALLEYS THERE WAS RAIN ACCOMPANIED BY SLEET THE THERMOMETER GENERALLY STOOD
GAVE IT A RELISH THAT THE DANGER WAS VERY LITTLE WAS CERTAIN FOR MY TWO COMPANIONS MADE A GOOD FIRE A THING WHICH IS NEVER DONE WHEN IT IS SUSPECTED THAT INDIANS ARE NEAR I REACHED THE PLACE OF OUR BIVOUAC BY SUNSET
OR WHAT CHANGE COMPELLED A TRIBE OF MEN TO LEAVE THE FINE REGIONS OF THE NORTH TO TRAVEL DOWN THE CORDILLERA OR BACKBONE OF AMERICA TO INVENT AND BUILD CANOES WHICH ARE NOT USED BY THE TRIBES OF CHILE PERU AND BRAZIL
ONE LAZO WAS THROWN OVER HIS HORNS AS HE RUSHED AT THE HORSE AND ANOTHER ROUND HIS HIND LEGS IN A MINUTE THE MONSTER WAS STRETCHED POWERLESS ON THE GROUND AFTER THE LAZO HAS ONCE BEEN DRAWN TIGHTLY ROUND THE HORNS OF A FURIOUS ANIMAL
THOUGH WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AS THE FATHER OF ONE MAN WAS AFRAID TO LET HIM GO AND ANOTHER WHO SEEMED WILLING WAS DESCRIBED TO ME AS SO FEARFUL THAT I WAS AFRAID TO TAKE HIM
AND EVEN EXTENDED TO THE VERY CREST OF THE HILL ON THESE CRESTS HUGE MASSES EXCEEDING IN DIMENSIONS ANY SMALL BUILDING SEEMED TO STAND ARRESTED IN THEIR HEADLONG COURSE THERE ALSO
A CONCLUSION IN CONFORMITY WITH THE TRIFLING DIFFERENCE OF HABIT
WHEREAS HE HAS NEVER FOUND A DEAD CALF MOREOVER THE DEAD BODIES OF FULL GROWN HORSES ARE MORE FREQUENTLY FOUND AS IF MORE SUBJECT TO DISEASE OR ACCIDENTS THAN THOSE OF THE CATTLE
ARE NOW STEADILY AT WORK WEARING AWAY BOTH THE SOLID ROCK AND THESE ALLUVIAL DEPOSITS ALONG THE WHOLE LINE OF EVERY MAIN VALLEY AND SIDE VALLEY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE HERE TO GIVE THE REASONS
INTERSECTED BY AN HORIZON LEVEL AS THAT OF THE OCEAN DURING THE NIGHT A HEAVY DEW FELL A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH WE DID NOT EXPERIENCE WITHIN THE CORDILLERA THE ROAD PROCEEDED FOR SOME DISTANCE DUE EAST ACROSS A LOW SWAMP THEN MEETING THE DRY PLAIN
HIS HAIR WAS NEATLY CUT AND HE WAS DISTRESSED IF HIS WELL POLISHED SHOES WERE DIRTIED HE WAS FOND OF ADMIRING HIMSELF IN A LOOKING GLASS AND A MERRY FACED LITTLE INDIAN BOY FROM THE RIO NEGRO WHOM WE HAD FOR SOME MONTHS ON BOARD SOON PERCEIVED THIS AND USED TO MOCK HIM
IT CONSISTS CHIEFLY OF GRAND BARE PINNACLES OF A RED POTASH GRANITE WHICH LOW DOWN ON THE WESTERN FLANK ARE COVERED BY A SANDSTONE CONVERTED BY THE FORMER HEAT INTO A QUARTZ ROCK
THESE FROZEN MASSES DURING THE PROCESS OF THAWING
DURING THE WINTER WE MUST LOOK TO THE SPRINGS ROUND THE SIERRA VENTANA AS THE SOURCE OF ITS PURE AND LIMPID STREAM I SUSPECT THE PLAINS OF PATAGONIA LIKE THOSE OF AUSTRALIA
IT IS THEREFORE A STRIKING FACT THAT IN THE FRIENDLY ARCHIPELAGO
ABOUT HALF OF SOME OF THE HERDS ARE MOUSE OR LEAD COLOURED
EXTREMELY RUGGED AND BROKEN AND SO ENTIRELY DESTITUTE OF TREES AND EVEN BUSHES THAT WE ACTUALLY COULD NOT MAKE A SKEWER TO STRETCH OUT OUR MEAT OVER THE FIRE OF THISTLE STALKS
WHEN THE INDIANS COME WE SHALL HAVE A FEAST IN THE MORNING WE ALL SALLIED FORTH TO HUNT AND ALTHOUGH WE HAD NOT MUCH SUCCESS THERE WERE SOME ANIMATED CHASES SOON AFTER STARTING
IN THE EVENING THE SAUROPHAGUS TAKES ITS STAND ON A BUSH OFTEN BY THE ROADSIDE
THE HEAD ITSELF POSSESSED CONSIDERABLE POWERS OF MOVEMENT BY MEANS OF A SHORT NECK IN ONE ZOOPHYTE THE HEAD ITSELF WAS FIXED BUT THE LOWER JAW FREE IN ANOTHER
EVEN IN SUCH TRIFLING PECULIARITIES AS STANDING ON THE BACKS OF CATTLE IT DIFFERS ONLY IN BEING A LITTLE SMALLER AND IN ITS PLUMAGE AND EGGS BEING OF A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SHADE OF COLOUR THIS CLOSE AGREEMENT IN STRUCTURE AND HABITS
ON THE OTHER HAND ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE ISLANDS IN THE PACIFIC WHICH ARE ENCIRCLED BY BARRIER REEFS ARE OF VOLCANIC ORIGIN OFTEN WITH THE REMNANTS OF CRATERS STILL DISTINGUISHABLE NOT ONE OF THEM IS KNOWN TO HAVE EVER BEEN IN ERUPTION
WHEN IT WAS DARK I FOUND THAT AS OFTEN AS I RUBBED ANY PART OF A BRANCH THE WHOLE BECAME STRONGLY PHOSPHORESCENT WITH A GREEN LIGHT I DO NOT THINK I EVER SAW ANY OBJECT MORE BEAUTIFULLY SO
BEING MINGLED WITH A PLEASANT WARBLING IT IS HEARD ONLY DURING THE SPRING AT OTHER TIMES ITS CRY IS HARSH AND FAR FROM HARMONIOUS NEAR MALDONADO THESE BIRDS WERE TAME AND BOLD THEY CONSTANTLY ATTENDED THE COUNTRY HOUSES IN NUMBERS
THEY PRECISELY RESEMBLE IN COMPOSITION THE MATTER WHICH THE TORRENTS IN EACH VALLEY WOULD DEPOSIT IF THEY WERE CHECKED IN THEIR COURSE BY ANY CAUSE SUCH AS ENTERING A LAKE OR ARM OF THE SEA BUT THE TORRENTS INSTEAD OF DEPOSITING MATTER
BUT GOT THERE WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY EVERY TWENTY YARDS I HAD THE CRAMP IN THE UPPER PART OF BOTH THIGHS SO THAT I WAS AFRAID I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE GOT DOWN AGAIN
AND WHO FREQUENT EVERY RAVINE WHERE THERE IS A LITTLE PASTURE ARE THE USUAL DISCOVERERS
WHO SAW A WRETCHED MOTHER PICK UP HER BLEEDING DYING INFANT BOY WHOM HER HUSBAND HAD MERCILESSLY DASHED ON THE STONES FOR DROPPING A BASKET OF SEA EGGS HOW LITTLE CAN THE HIGHER POWERS OF THE MIND BE BROUGHT INTO PLAY WHAT IS THERE FOR IMAGINATION TO PICTURE
HE FINDS THAT THE FEMALE CUCKOO WHICH ACCORDING TO MOST OBSERVERS LAYS AT LEAST FROM FOUR TO SIX EGGS MUST PAIR WITH THE MALE EACH TIME AFTER LAYING ONLY ONE OR TWO EGGS NOW IF THE CUCKOO WAS OBLIGED TO SIT ON HER OWN EGGS SHE WOULD EITHER HAVE TO SIT ON ALL TOGETHER
WHEN THE ANIMAL WAS ALIVE I PLACED MY FINGER WITHIN HALF AN INCH OF ITS HEAD AND NOT THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE WAS TAKEN IT MADE ITS WAY HOWEVER ABOUT THE ROOM NEARLY AS WELL AS THE OTHERS CONSIDERING THE STRICTLY SUBTERRANEAN HABITS OF THE TUCUTUCO
FOR IF IN THE NIGHT A PUMA OR EVEN A FOX APPROACHES NOTHING CAN PREVENT THE HORSES DISPERSING IN EVERY DIRECTION AND A STORM WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT A SHORT TIME SINCE
IF THEY DID NOT AS THE WHOLE SANK DOWNWARDS ONE ATOLL WOULD BE DIVIDED INTO TWO OR MORE IN THE MALDIVA ARCHIPELAGO THERE ARE DISTINCT ATOLLS SO RELATED TO EACH OTHER IN POSITION AND SEPARATED BY CHANNELS EITHER UNFATHOMABLE OR VERY DEEP
AND THESE ARE VIEWED THROUGH MISTS AND ENDLESS STORMS THE HABITABLE LAND IS REDUCED TO THE STONES ON THE BEACH IN SEARCH OF FOOD THEY ARE COMPELLED UNCEASINGLY TO WANDER FROM SPOT TO SPOT AND SO STEEP IS THE COAST THAT THEY CAN ONLY MOVE ABOUT IN THEIR WRETCHED CANOES
THAT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS ONE SMALL ISLAND DIFFERENT COLOURS PREDOMINATE
THE WATERS OF THE SEA IN A TRANSVERSE SECTION WITHIN THESE VALLEYS THE BOTTOM IS NEARLY LEVEL OR RISES BUT VERY LITTLE TOWARDS EITHER SIDE HENCE THE FRAGMENTS APPEAR TO HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE HEAD OF THE VALLEY
HOW MUCH MORE REASONABLY THE SAME QUESTION MAY BE ASKED WITH RESPECT TO THESE BARBARIANS AT NIGHT FIVE OR SIX HUMAN BEINGS NAKED AND SCARCELY PROTECTED FROM THE WIND AND RAIN OF THIS TEMPESTUOUS CLIMATE SLEEP ON THE WET GROUND COILED UP LIKE ANIMALS
WAS THE GREAT CHANGE IN THE KIND OF MUSCULAR ACTION FROM THAT OF HARD RIDING TO THAT OF STILL HARDER CLIMBING IT IS A LESSON WORTH REMEMBERING AS IN SOME CASES IT MIGHT CAUSE MUCH DIFFICULTY
ALSO FORMS PART OF THE ZOOPHYTE AS A WHOLE IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE ROOTS OF A TREE FORM PART OF THE WHOLE TREE AND NOT OF THE INDIVIDUAL LEAF OR FLOWER BUDS
A CARGO WEIGHING FOUR HUNDRED SIXTEEN POUNDS MORE THAN TWENTY NINE STONE BUT IN A MOUNTAINOUS COUNTRY ONE HUNDRED POUNDS LESS YET WITH WHAT DELICATE SLIM LIMBS WITHOUT ANY PROPORTIONAL BULK OF MUSCLE THESE ANIMALS SUPPORT SO GREAT A BURDEN
WHEN WE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE MAIN RIDGE WE HAD MUCH DIFFICULTY IN FINDING ANY WATER AND WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO HAVE PASSED THE NIGHT WITHOUT ANY AT LAST
A CIRCUMSTANCE OF RARE OCCURRENCE IN THESE MOUNTAINS NOW COMMENCED A HEAVY AND LONG CLIMB SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE PEUQUENES BOLD CONICAL HILLS OF RED GRANITE ROSE ON EACH HAND IN THE VALLEYS THERE WERE SEVERAL BROAD FIELDS OF PERPETUAL SNOW
A GREAT LOGGERHEADED DUCK OR GOOSE ANAS BRACHYPTERA WHICH SOMETIMES WEIGHS TWENTY TWO POUNDS IS VERY ABUNDANT THESE BIRDS WERE IN FORMER DAYS CALLED
AND WE AS WELL AS OTHERS MAY CALL THIS GOOD SUCCESS BAY IN THE MORNING THE CAPTAIN SENT A PARTY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE FUEGIANS WHEN WE CAME WITHIN HAIL
SET OUT FOR BUENOS AYRES RIO SAUCE SIERRA VENTANA THIRD POSTA DRIVING HORSES BOLAS PARTRIDGES AND FOXES FEATURES OF THE COUNTRY
ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH WHICH CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAS CALLED AFTER SIR J BANKS IN COMMEMORATION OF HIS DISASTROUS EXCURSION WHICH PROVED FATAL TO TWO MEN OF HIS PARTY AND NEARLY SO TO DOCTOR SOLANDER THE SNOW STORM WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF THEIR MISFORTUNE
ONE AFTER ANOTHER IN THESE ACTIONS WE APPARENTLY BEHOLD AS PERFECT A TRANSMISSION OF WILL IN THE ZOOPHYTE
WHOSE ANIMAL HEAT BRINGS THEIR YOUNG INTO LIFE WHOSE FOOD THEY LIVE UPON AND WHOSE DEATH WOULD CAUSE THEIRS DURING THE PERIOD OF INFANCY IT IS REMARKABLE THAT SOME OF THE SPECIES BUT NOT ALL BOTH OF THE CUCKOO AND MOLOTHRUS
THE GAUCHOS SAY THEY OFTEN PASS AT FULL SPEED OVER GROUND WHICH WOULD BE IMPASSABLE AT A SLOWER PACE IN THE SAME MANNER AS A MAN IS ABLE TO SKATE OVER THIN ICE WHEN HUNTING
WE DESCENDED TO THE UPPER LIMIT OF VEGETATION AND FOUND GOOD QUARTERS FOR THE NIGHT UNDER THE SHELTER OF SOME LARGE FRAGMENTS OF ROCK WE MET HERE SOME PASSENGERS WHO MADE ANXIOUS INQUIRIES ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ROAD SHORTLY AFTER IT WAS DARK THE CLOUDS SUDDENLY CLEARED AWAY
MY GUIDE HAD BEEN PRESENT WHEN MANY INDIANS WERE KILLED THE WOMEN ESCAPED TO THE TOP OF THE RIDGE AND FOUGHT MOST DESPERATELY WITH GREAT STONES MANY THUS SAVING THEMSELVES
AND IT IS ONLY USED FOR A FEW DAYS AT GOEREE ROADS I SAW A PLACE WHERE ONE OF THESE NAKED MEN HAD SLEPT WHICH ABSOLUTELY OFFERED NO MORE COVER THAN THE FORM OF A HARE THE MAN WAS EVIDENTLY LIVING BY HIMSELF
THE GENERAL COLOUR OF THE ROCK WAS DULLISH PURPLE AND THE STRATIFICATION VERY DISTINCT IF THE SCENERY WAS NOT BEAUTIFUL IT WAS REMARKABLE AND GRAND WE MET DURING THE DAY SEVERAL HERDS OF CATTLE WHICH MEN WERE DRIVING DOWN FROM THE HIGHER VALLEYS IN THE CORDILLERA
AND ON THE SUCCEEDING DAY FAVOURED TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE BY A FINE EASTERLY BREEZE WE CLOSED IN WITH THE BARNEVELTS AND RUNNING PAST CAPE DECEIT WITH ITS STONY PEAKS ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK DOUBLED THE WEATHER BEATEN CAPE HORN THE EVENING WAS CALM AND BRIGHT
THE QUANTITY OF CRUMBLING STONE ON THE CORDILLERA IS VERY GREAT OCCASIONALLY IN THE SPRING GREAT MASSES OF THIS DETRITUS SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAINS AND COVER THE SNOW DRIFTS IN THE VALLEYS THUS FORMING NATURAL ICE HOUSES
THE ISLAND BECOMING LOWER AND SMALLER AND THE SPACE BETWEEN THE INNER EDGE OF THE REEF AND THE BEACH PROPORTIONATELY BROADER A SECTION OF THE REEF AND ISLAND IN THIS STATE AFTER A SUBSIDENCE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET IS GIVEN BY THE DOTTED LINES
WAITING FOR A TROOP OF SOLDIERS WHICH GENERAL ROSAS HAD THE KINDNESS TO SEND TO INFORM ME WOULD SHORTLY TRAVEL TO BUENOS AYRES AND HE ADVISED ME TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE ESCORT
WE OUGHT NOT TO EXPECT ANY CLOSER SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE ORGANIC BEINGS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ANDES THAN ON THE OPPOSITE SHORES OF THE OCEAN IN BOTH CASES WE MUST LEAVE OUT OF THE QUESTION THOSE KINDS WHICH HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CROSS THE BARRIER
WE FOLLOWED THE SAME WATER COURSE AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY TILL IT DWINDLED AWAY AND WE WERE THEN COMPELLED TO CRAWL BLINDLY AMONG THE TREES THESE FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE ELEVATION AND OF THE IMPETUOUS WINDS WERE LOW THICK AND CROOKED
AND OF THE PROTEUS A REPTILE LIVING IN DARK CAVERNS FILLED WITH WATER IN BOTH OF WHICH ANIMALS THE EYE IS IN AN ALMOST RUDIMENTARY STATE AND IS COVERED BY A TENDINOUS MEMBRANE AND SKIN
BUT THE ATMOSPHERE REMARKABLY HAZY I THOUGHT THE APPEARANCE FOREBODED A GALE BUT THE GAUCHOS SAID IT WAS OWING TO THE PLAIN AT SOME GREAT DISTANCE IN THE INTERIOR BEING ON FIRE
VERY LIKE THE BRAYING OF AN ASS BUT WHILE AT SEA AND UNDISTURBED ITS NOTE IS VERY DEEP AND SOLEMN AND IS OFTEN HEARD IN THE NIGHT TIME IN DIVING ITS LITTLE WINGS ARE USED AS FINS BUT ON THE LAND AS FRONT LEGS
STREAMS OF STONES WHICH IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO EVERY ONE CONVEYS THE SAME IDEA THESE SCENES ARE ON THE SPOT RENDERED MORE STRIKING BY THE CONTRAST OF THE LOW ROUNDED FORMS OF THE NEIGHBOURING HILLS
R MATTHEWS OF WHOM AND OF THE NATIVES CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAS PUBLISHED A FULL AND EXCELLENT ACCOUNT TWO MEN ONE OF WHOM DIED IN ENGLAND OF THE SMALL POX A BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL WERE ORIGINALLY TAKEN AND WE HAD NOW ON BOARD
THE SNOW WHITE GANDER INVARIABLY ACCOMPANIED BY HIS DARKER CONSORT AND STANDING CLOSE BY EACH OTHER ON SOME DISTANT ROCKY POINT IS A COMMON FEATURE IN THE LANDSCAPE IN THESE ISLANDS
INDIVIDUALS PROPAGATED BY BUDS SEEM MORE INTIMATELY RELATED TO EACH OTHER THAN EGGS OR SEEDS ARE TO THEIR PARENTS IT SEEMS NOW PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHED THAT PLANTS PROPAGATED BY BUDS
LIKE SO MUCH SAND ON A VIBRATING BOARD AND FIND THEIR LEVEL
AND EACH MAN WHIRLING THE BALLS ROUND HIS HEAD AT LENGTH THE FOREMOST THREW THEM REVOLVING THROUGH THE AIR IN AN INSTANT THE OSTRICH ROLLED OVER AND OVER ITS LEGS FAIRLY LASHED TOGETHER BY THE THONG
I HAVE ALREADY SAID THE MOUNTAIN IS COMPOSED OF WHITE QUARTZ ROCK AND WITH IT A LITTLE GLOSSY CLAY SLATE IS ASSOCIATED AT THE HEIGHT OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE PLAIN
THE DISTANCE IS FORTY FIVE MILES THE DEW WHICH IN THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT WETTED THE SADDLE CLOTHS UNDER WHICH WE SLEPT WAS IN THE MORNING FROZEN THE PLAIN
IN THE MORNING I STARTED WITH SIX HORSES AND TWO GAUCHOS THE LATTER WERE CAPITAL MEN FOR THE PURPOSE AND WELL ACCUSTOMED TO LIVING ON THEIR OWN RESOURCES THE WEATHER WAS VERY BOISTEROUS AND COLD WITH HEAVY HAIL STORMS
WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS SECOND SPECIES I THOUGHT IT WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE MALDONADO KIND HAVING AFTERWARDS PROCURED A SPECIMEN AND COMPARING THE TWO WITHOUT PARTICULAR CARE THEY APPEARED SO VERY SIMILAR THAT I CHANGED MY OPINION
EVERY ONE ACCUSTOMED TO VERY YOUNG CHILDREN KNOWS HOW SELDOM ONE CAN GET AN ANSWER EVEN TO SO SIMPLE A QUESTION AS WHETHER A THING IS BLACK OR WHITE THE IDEA OF BLACK OR WHITE SEEMS ALTERNATELY TO FILL THEIR MINDS SO IT WAS WITH THESE FUEGIANS
THAT THE AREAS WITH THE TWO BLUE TINTS ARE OF WIDE EXTENT AND THAT THEY LIE SEPARATE FROM EXTENSIVE LINES OF COAST COLOURED RED BOTH OF WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT NATURALLY HAVE BEEN INFERRED ON THE THEORY OF THE NATURE OF THE REEFS HAVING BEEN GOVERNED BY THE NATURE OF THE EARTH'S MOVEMENT
THE TIDES WOULD BE ALWAYS WEARING DEEPER AND BROADER CHANNELS BETWEEN THEM AT THE PRESENT DAY EVEN IN THE MOST RETIRED SOUNDS ON THE COAST OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO THE CURRENTS IN THE TRANSVERSE BREAKS WHICH CONNECT THE LONGITUDINAL CHANNELS ARE VERY STRONG
EACH CELL HAD TWO THE YOUNG CELLS AT THE END OF THE BRANCHES OF THESE CORALLINES
WHERE THEY BECOME HIDDEN BY THE IRREGULAR PILES OF DEBRIS AT THE LOWER END OR MOUTHS OF THE VALLEYS THEY ARE CONTINUOUSLY UNITED TO THOSE LAND LOCKED PLAINS ALSO FORMED OF SHINGLE AT THE FOOT OF THE MAIN CORDILLERA
AND HENCE IT WAS GENERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND OUT BY CROSS QUESTIONING WHETHER ONE HAD RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING WHICH THEY HAD ASSERTED THEIR SIGHT WAS REMARKABLY ACUTE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SAILORS FROM LONG PRACTICE CAN MAKE OUT A DISTANT OBJECT MUCH BETTER THAN A LANDSMAN
WE DID NOT CROSS A SINGLE STREAM IN MANY PARTS THE GROUND WAS INCRUSTED WITH A SALINE EFFLORESCENCE HENCE WE HAD THE SAME SALT LOVING PLANTS WHICH ARE COMMON NEAR BAHIA BLANCA THE LANDSCAPE HAS A UNIFORM CHARACTER FROM THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN
COULD INJURE THE CORALS ON THE REEF NOW EVERY REEF OF THE FRINGING CLASS IS BREACHED BY A NARROW GATEWAY
THE CANOE THEIR MOST INGENIOUS WORK POOR AS IT IS HAS REMAINED THE SAME AS WE KNOW FROM DRAKE FOR THE LAST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS WHILST BEHOLDING THESE SAVAGES ONE ASKS WHENCE HAVE THEY COME WHAT COULD HAVE TEMPTED
THEY PUT THE RAG WITH ITS SPARK OF FIRE IN THE MIDDLE AND COVERED IT UP THE NEST BEING THEN HELD UP TO THE WIND BY DEGREES IT SMOKED MORE AND MORE
THEY STRUCK HIM ON THE LEGS WITH SUCH A JERK AS TO THROW HIM DOWN AND TO RENDER HIM FOR SOME TIME INSENSIBLE THE MAN AFTER LUCIANO HAD HAD HIS TALK WAS ALLOWED TO ESCAPE
OR MEAT ROASTED WITH THE SKIN ON IT THIS IS AS SUPERIOR TO COMMON BEEF AS VENISON IS TO MUTTON A LARGE CIRCULAR PIECE TAKEN FROM THE BACK IS ROASTED ON THE EMBERS WITH THE HIDE DOWNWARDS
THEIR DESTROYER A SMALL AND PRETTY FOX WAS ALSO SINGULARLY NUMEROUS IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY WE COULD NOT HAVE SEEN LESS THAN FORTY OR FIFTY THEY WERE GENERALLY NEAR THEIR EARTHS
WE HERE HEARD THAT THE SILVERY CLOUDS WHICH WE HAD ADMIRED FROM THE BRIGHT REGION ABOVE HAD POURED DOWN TORRENTS OF RAIN THE VALLEY FROM THIS POINT GRADUALLY OPENED AND THE HILLS BECAME MERE WATER WORN HILLOCKS COMPARED TO THE GIANTS BEHIND
NEITHER KEPT OUT THE WIND NOR RAIN INDEED
EVEN THE IRON FRAMED GAUCHOS PROFESSED THEMSELVES GLAD WHEN THEY REACHED THE SETTLEMENT AFTER OUR LITTLE EXCURSION THE GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF THESE ISLANDS IS IN MOST RESPECTS SIMPLE
WHETHER OF SOLID ROCK OR SALT WATER FIVE A
IN LIKE MANNER FALLS WITHIN AN UPPER RETURN STREAM AT FIRST IT APPEARS RATHER SURPRISING THAT THE TRADE WIND ALONG THE NORTHERN PARTS OF CHILE AND ON THE COAST OF PERU SHOULD BLOW IN SO VERY SOUTHERLY A DIRECTION AS IT DOES
DODGED BEHIND THE BEAST TILL AT LAST HE CONTRIVED TO GIVE THE FATAL TOUCH TO THE MAIN TENDON OF THE HIND LEG AFTER WHICH WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY HE DROVE HIS KNIFE INTO THE HEAD OF THE SPINAL MARROW AND THE COW DROPPED
ON THE EAST COAST THE NATIVES AS WE HAVE SEEN HAVE GUANACO CLOAKS AND ON THE WEST THEY POSSESS SEAL SKINS AMONGST THESE CENTRAL TRIBES THE MEN GENERALLY HAVE AN OTTER SKIN OR SOME SMALL SCRAP ABOUT AS LARGE AS A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF
AS FAR AS WE COULD MAKE OUT HE SEEMED TO CONSIDER THE ELEMENTS THEMSELVES AS THE AVENGING AGENTS IT IS EVIDENT IN THIS CASE HOW NATURALLY IN A RACE A LITTLE MORE ADVANCED IN CULTURE THE ELEMENTS WOULD BECOME PERSONIFIED WHAT THE BAD WILD MEN WERE
CAPTAIN SULIVAN INFORMS ME THAT THEY VARY MUCH LESS IN THE GENERAL FORM OF THEIR BODIES AND IN THE SHAPE OF THEIR HORNS THAN ENGLISH CATTLE IN COLOUR THEY DIFFER MUCH AND IT IS A REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE
BUT IN REALITY IT SEEMS MORE PROBABLE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HURLED DOWN FROM THE NEAREST SLOPES
THE SHELLS IN THE PEUQUENES OR OLDEST RIDGE PROVE AS BEFORE REMARKED THAT IT HAS BEEN UPRAISED FOURTEEN THOUSAND FEET SINCE A SECONDARY PERIOD
AT NIGHT WHEN THEY WERE SITTING ROUND THE FIRE AND PLAYING AT CARDS I RETIRED TO VIEW SUCH A SALVATOR ROSA SCENE THEY WERE SEATED UNDER A LOW CLIFF SO THAT I COULD LOOK DOWN UPON THEM
AND SEVENTY MILES IN ANOTHER LINE AND IS IN MANY RESPECTS EMINENTLY CURIOUS
WHICH THE INHABITANTS ASSERTED HAD STOOD SEVEN YEARS BEFORE JUST ABOVE HIGH WATER MARK BUT NOW WAS DAILY WASHED BY EVERY TIDE ON INQUIRY I FOUND THAT THREE EARTHQUAKES ONE OF THEM SEVERE HAD BEEN FELT HERE DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS
SO THAT NONE OF THE GRAVY IS LOST IF ANY WORTHY ALDERMAN HAD SUPPED WITH US THAT EVENING
THE PARTY SEPARATED AND SO ARRANGED THEIR PLANS
AROUND THE PARTY WERE LYING DOGS ARMS REMNANTS OF DEER AND OSTRICHES AND THEIR LONG SPEARS WERE STUCK IN THE TURF FURTHER IN THE DARK BACKGROUND THEIR HORSES WERE TIED UP
THE VEIN OCCURRED AT NO GREAT DISTANCE STANDING UP LIKE A WEDGE OF METAL THE MINERS ALSO TAKING A CROWBAR WITH THEM OFTEN WANDER ON SUNDAYS OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN THIS SOUTH PART OF CHILE THE MEN WHO DRIVE CATTLE INTO THE CORDILLERA
THE VALLEYS BEING FILLED UP WITH AN IMMENSE THICKNESS OF STRATIFIED ALLUVIUM THE FEATURES IN THE SCENERY OF THE ANDES WHICH STRUCK ME MOST AS CONTRASTED WITH THE OTHER MOUNTAIN CHAINS WITH WHICH I AM ACQUAINTED WERE THE FLAT FRINGES SOMETIMES EXPANDING INTO NARROW PLAINS ON EACH SIDE OF THE VALLEYS
I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED HOW WIDE WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAVAGE AND CIVILIZED MAN IT IS GREATER THAN BETWEEN A WILD AND DOMESTICATED ANIMAL
BUT FROM THAT POINT IN ITS COURSE TO THE SEA IT IS QUITE IMPASSABLE AND HENCE MAKES A MOST USEFUL BARRIER AGAINST THE INDIANS INSIGNIFICANT AS THIS STREAM IS
EVEN THE VIEW WAS INSIGNIFICANT A PLAIN LIKE THE SEA BUT WITHOUT ITS BEAUTIFUL COLOUR AND DEFINED OUTLINE THE SCENE HOWEVER WAS NOVEL AND A LITTLE DANGER LIKE SALT TO MEAT
THE PERIL IS IMMINENT AND THE DIFFICULTY OF SUBSEQUENT ESCAPE GREAT TO ANY ONE OVERTAKEN BY BAD WEATHER BETWEEN THE TWO RANGES A CERTAIN CAVE OFFERS THE ONLY PLACE OF REFUGE
THEY EXPLAINED ALSO WHAT THEY WANTED BY ACTING AS IF THEY HAD A PIECE OF BLUBBER IN THEIR MOUTH AND THEN PRETENDING TO CUT INSTEAD OF TEAR IT I HAVE NOT AS YET NOTICED THE FUEGIANS WHOM WE HAD ON BOARD
WHEN ANGRY OR FRIGHTENED THEY UTTER THE TUCUTUCO OF THOSE I KEPT ALIVE SEVERAL EVEN THE FIRST DAY BECAME QUITE TAME NOT ATTEMPTING TO BITE OR TO RUN AWAY OTHERS WERE A LITTLE WILDER
THE NOISE BEING VERY PECULIAR RESEMBLING THAT OF BUBBLES OF AIR PASSING RAPIDLY FROM A SMALL ORIFICE UNDER WATER SO AS TO PRODUCE AN ACUTE SOUND ACCORDING TO AZARA THIS BIRD LIKE THE CUCKOO DEPOSITS ITS EGGS IN OTHER BIRDS NESTS
OWING TO THE EQUABLE AND HIGH STATE OF ATMOSPHERIC DRYNESS THIS DRYNESS WAS SHOWN BY THE MANNER IN WHICH WOODWORK SHRANK
WE SOON ENTERED THE BAND OF CLOUDS AND DID NOT AGAIN EMERGE FROM IT THAT DAY
WHICH HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE SPOT ON PURPOSE FROM THEIR PREVIOUS TREATMENT BEING TOO MUCH TERRIFIED TO LEAVE THE HERD THEY ARE EASILY DRIVEN IF THEIR STRENGTH LAST OUT TO THE SETTLEMENT
INDEED IT IS NEARLY THE ONLY BIRD IN SOUTH AMERICA WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED TO TAKE ITS STAND FOR THE PURPOSE OF SINGING THE SONG MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT OF THE SEDGE WARBLER BUT IS MORE POWERFUL SOME HARSH NOTES AND SOME VERY HIGH ONES
BUT MANY DETAILS IN STRUCTURE AND EXCEPTIONAL CASES CAN THUS ALSO BE SIMPLY EXPLAINED I WILL GIVE ONLY A FEW INSTANCES IN BARRIER REEFS IT HAS LONG BEEN REMARKED WITH SURPRISE THAT THE PASSAGES THROUGH THE REEF EXACTLY FACE
ANALOGOUS FACTS HAVE ALSO BEEN OBSERVED IN OTHER QUARTERS OF THE WORLD ON THE SUPPOSITION OF THE SUBSEQUENT AND GRADUAL ELEVATION OF THE PORTILLO LINE THIS CAN BE UNDERSTOOD FOR A CHAIN OF ISLETS WOULD AT FIRST APPEAR AND AS THESE WERE LIFTED UP
AS IF STRUCK BY LIGHTNING HE CUT OFF PIECES OF FLESH WITH THE SKIN TO IT BUT WITHOUT ANY BONES SUFFICIENT FOR OUR EXPEDITION WE THEN RODE ON TO OUR SLEEPING PLACE AND HAD FOR SUPPER
ARE NOW IN SEVERAL INSTANCES SUNK SEVERAL FATHOMS BENEATH THE SURFACE THE CHAGOS GROUP APPEARS FROM SOME CAUSE POSSIBLY FROM THE SUBSIDENCE HAVING BEEN TOO RAPID AT PRESENT TO BE MUCH LESS FAVOURABLY CIRCUMSTANCED FOR THE GROWTH OF REEFS THAN FORMERLY
BUT WHEN WE REFLECT THAT THE CORDILLERA RUNNING IN A NORTH AND SOUTH LINE INTERCEPTS LIKE A GREAT WALL THE ENTIRE DEPTH OF THE LOWER ATMOSPHERIC CURRENT WE CAN EASILY SEE THAT THE TRADE WIND MUST BE DRAWN NORTHWARD FOLLOWING THE LINE OF MOUNTAINS TOWARDS THE EQUATORIAL REGIONS
OR MOST CLOSELY ALLIED TO THOSE OF PATAGONIA
BUT MY TWO COMPANIONS ALMOST INSTANTLY BY WAY OF APOLOGY MADE THE COMMON SALUTE OF THE COUNTRY BY TAKING OFF THEIR HATS WHERE WOULD ONE OF THE LOWER OR HIGHER CLASSES IN EUROPE HAVE SHOWN SUCH FEELING POLITENESS TO A POOR AND MISERABLE OBJECT OF A DEGRADED RACE
HIS FACE WAS CROSSED BY TWO BROAD TRANSVERSE BARS ONE PAINTED BRIGHT RED REACHED FROM EAR TO EAR AND INCLUDED THE UPPER LIP THE OTHER WHITE LIKE CHALK EXTENDED ABOVE AND PARALLEL TO THE FIRST SO THAT EVEN HIS EYELIDS WERE THUS COLOURED
ON THE WEST COAST HOWEVER THE WIGWAMS ARE RATHER BETTER FOR THEY ARE COVERED WITH SEAL SKINS WE WERE DETAINED HERE SEVERAL DAYS BY THE BAD WEATHER THE CLIMATE IS CERTAINLY WRETCHED THE SUMMER SOLSTICE WAS NOW PASSED
IN A VALLEY SOUTH OF BERKELEY SOUND WHICH SOME OF OUR PARTY CALLED THE GREAT VALLEY OF FRAGMENTS IT WAS NECESSARY TO CROSS AN UNINTERRUPTED BAND HALF A MILE WIDE BY JUMPING FROM ONE POINTED STONE TO ANOTHER
FUEGIA BASKET WAS A NICE MODEST RESERVED YOUNG GIRL WITH A RATHER PLEASING BUT SOMETIMES SULLEN EXPRESSION AND VERY QUICK IN LEARNING ANYTHING ESPECIALLY LANGUAGES THIS SHE SHOWED IN PICKING UP SOME PORTUGUESE AND SPANISH
THIS HOWEVER DOES NOT APPLY TO A MAN ON HORSEBACK FOR WHEN THE SPEED OF THE HORSE IS ADDED TO THE FORCE OF THE ARM IT IS SAID THAT THEY CAN BE WHIRLED WITH EFFECT TO THE DISTANCE OF EIGHTY YARDS
HENCE IN THESE CASES IT WOULD APPEAR THAT VOLCANOS BURST FORTH INTO ACTION AND BECOME EXTINGUISHED ON THE SAME SPOTS ACCORDINGLY AS ELEVATORY OR SUBSIDING MOVEMENTS PREVAIL THERE
AND THEY SEEM CLOSELY ALLIED TO THE FAMOUS PATAGONIANS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN THEIR ONLY GARMENT CONSISTS OF A MANTLE MADE OF GUANACO SKIN WITH THE WOOL OUTSIDE THIS THEY WEAR JUST THROWN OVER THEIR SHOULDERS LEAVING THEIR PERSONS AS OFTEN EXPOSED AS COVERED
EVERY HAIR ON A DOG'S BACK CRACKLED EVEN THE LINEN SHEETS AND LEATHERN STRAPS OF THE SADDLE WHEN HANDLED EMITTED SPARKS
THE DIFFERENT TRIBES WHEN AT WAR ARE CANNIBALS FROM THE CONCURRENT BUT QUITE INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE OF THE BOY TAKEN BY MISTER LOW AND OF JEMMY BUTTON IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT WHEN PRESSED IN WINTER BY HUNGER
ALTHOUGH THE PORTILLO CHAIN IS HERE HIGHER THAN THE PEUQUENES THE WATERS DRAINING THE INTERMEDIATE VALLEYS HAVE BURST THROUGH IT THE SAME FACT ON A GRANDER SCALE HAS BEEN REMARKED IN THE EASTERN AND LOFTIEST LINE OF THE BOLIVIAN CORDILLERA THROUGH WHICH THE RIVERS PASS
HAD CLEARED A STRAIGHT SPACE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE BY THIS ROAD I ASCENDED TO A CONSIDERABLE ELEVATION AND OBTAINED A GOOD VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING WOODS THE TREES ALL BELONG TO ONE KIND THE FAGUS BETULOIDES
AND CALLING TO MIND THAT WHOLE RACES OF ANIMALS HAVE PASSED AWAY FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND THAT DURING THIS WHOLE PERIOD NIGHT AND DAY THESE STONES HAVE GONE RATTLING ONWARDS IN THEIR COURSE
AND INDEED VERY FEW OF THE SOLDIERS AT BAHIA BLANCA KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT HENCE WE HEARD OF BEDS OF COAL OF GOLD AND SILVER OF CAVES AND OF FORESTS ALL OF WHICH INFLAMED MY CURIOSITY
AND AN ATOLL IS LEFT AND THE LAND HAS BEEN REMOVED WE CAN NOW PERCEIVE HOW IT COMES THAT
THE NEAREST APPROACH TO A RELIGIOUS FEELING WHICH I HEARD OF WAS SHOWN BY YORK MINSTER
BUT THEY HAD NOW ALL BEEN REMOVED EVEN THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE GUANACOS HAD DECAMPED KNOWING WELL THAT IF OVERTAKEN HERE BY A SNOW STORM THEY WOULD BE CAUGHT IN A TRAP WE HAD A FINE VIEW OF A MASS OF MOUNTAINS CALLED TUPUNGATO THE WHOLE CLOTHED WITH UNBROKEN SNOW
THE OCEAN IS THEIR ETERNITY AND EACH NOTE OF THAT WILD MUSIC TOLD OF ONE MORE STEP TOWARDS THEIR DESTINY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE MIND TO COMPREHEND EXCEPT BY A SLOW PROCESS ANY EFFECT WHICH IS PRODUCED BY A CAUSE REPEATED SO OFTEN
OWING TO THE PERFECT TRANSPARENCY OF THE ATMOSPHERE WAS VERY REMARKABLE TRAVELERS HAVING OBSERVED THE DIFFICULTY OF JUDGING HEIGHTS AND DISTANCES AMIDST LOFTY MOUNTAINS HAVE GENERALLY ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTS OF COMPARISON
IN OTHER WORDS THE MOUNTAINS RISE MORE ABRUPTLY FROM THE PLAINS THAN FROM THE ALPINE COUNTRY OF CHILE A LEVEL AND BRILLIANTLY WHITE SEA OF CLOUDS WAS STRETCHED OUT BENEATH OUR FEET SHUTTING OUT THE VIEW OF THE EQUALLY LEVEL PAMPAS
AND WHILE CROSSING IT I SAW TWO HORSES GRAZING I IMMEDIATELY HID MYSELF IN THE LONG GRASS AND BEGAN TO RECONNOITRE BUT AS I COULD SEE NO SIGNS OF INDIANS
BUT SINCE THESE SHELLS LIVED IN A MODERATELY DEEP SEA IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT THE AREA NOW OCCUPIED BY THE CORDILLERA MUST HAVE SUBSIDED SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET IN NORTHERN CHILE AS MUCH AS SIX THOUSAND FEET
THOUGH PERHAPS THE MUTTERING OF THE OLD MAN BEFORE HE DISTRIBUTED THE PUTRID BLUBBER TO HIS FAMISHED PARTY MAY BE OF THIS NATURE EACH FAMILY OR TRIBE HAS A WIZARD OR CONJURING DOCTOR WHOSE OFFICE WE COULD NEVER CLEARLY ASCERTAIN JEMMY BELIEVED IN DREAMS
AND WE ENJOYED A FINE VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING ISLES CAPE HORN HOWEVER DEMANDED HIS TRIBUTE AND BEFORE NIGHT SENT US A GALE OF WIND DIRECTLY IN OUR TEETH WE STOOD OUT TO SEA AND ON THE SECOND DAY AGAIN MADE THE LAND
I DO NOT DOUBT THESE PEBBLES WERE IN A SIMILAR MANNER AGGREGATED AT A PERIOD WHEN THE GREAT CALCAREOUS FORMATION WAS DEPOSITING BENEATH THE SURROUNDING SEA
NOT ABOVE TWENTY FIVE FEET WIDE THE SECOND POSTA ON THE ROAD TO BUENOS AYRES STANDS ON ITS BANKS A LITTLE ABOVE THERE IS A FORD FOR HORSES WHERE THE WATER DOES NOT REACH TO THE HORSES BELLY
BUT THE DOGS KILLED ONE WHEN WE RETURNED TO THE POSTA WE FOUND TWO OF THE PARTY RETURNED WHO HAD BEEN HUNTING BY THEMSELVES THEY HAD KILLED A PUMA AND HAD FOUND AN OSTRICH'S NEST WITH TWENTY SEVEN EGGS IN IT
IN THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN REFERRED TO THIS SPECIES BUT HE WAS ALLUDING TO A SMALL CAVY WHICH TO THIS DAY IS THUS CALLED BY THE SPANIARDS THE GAUCHOS LAUGHED AT THE IDEA OF THE BLACK KIND BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE GREY
AND BEGAN TO SHOUT MOST VEHEMENTLY WISHING TO DIRECT US WHERE TO LAND WHEN WE WERE ON SHORE THE PARTY LOOKED RATHER ALARMED BUT CONTINUED TALKING AND MAKING GESTURES WITH GREAT RAPIDITY IT WAS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE MOST CURIOUS AND INTERESTING SPECTACLE I EVER BEHELD
THOUGH APPEARING HORIZONTAL HAD INSENSIBLY SLOPED UP TO A HEIGHT OF BETWEEN EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE SEA IN THE MORNING NINTH OF SEPTEMBER
SUCCEEDED IN MAKING FAR MORE HIDEOUS GRIMACES THEY COULD REPEAT WITH PERFECT CORRECTNESS EACH WORD IN ANY SENTENCE WE ADDRESSED THEM AND THEY REMEMBERED SUCH WORDS FOR SOME TIME YET WE EUROPEANS ALL KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISTINGUISH APART THE SOUNDS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE
THE WHOLE DISTANCE IS OVER A LEVEL DESERT PLAIN WITH NOT MORE THAN TWO OR THREE HOUSES THE SUN WAS EXCEEDINGLY POWERFUL AND THE RIDE DEVOID OF ALL INTEREST THERE IS VERY LITTLE WATER IN THIS TRAVERSIA
AND THE APPEARANCE OF SOME OF THE MASSES IS IN CONSEQUENCE MOST SINGULAR
SHE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE TIME ENOUGH FOR THE SUCCESSIVE HATCHINGS HENCE WE CAN PERCEIVE IN THE FACT OF THE CUCKOO PAIRING SEVERAL TIMES AND LAYING HER EGGS AT INTERVALS THE CAUSE OF HER DEPOSITING HER EGGS IN OTHER BIRDS NESTS
WE KEPT CLOSE TO THE FUEGIAN SHORE BUT THE OUTLINE OF THE RUGGED INHOSPITABLE STATENLAND WAS VISIBLE AMIDST THE CLOUDS IN THE AFTERNOON WE ANCHORED IN THE BAY OF GOOD SUCCESS WHILE ENTERING WE WERE SALUTED IN A MANNER BECOMING THE INHABITANTS OF THIS SAVAGE LAND
THAT THEIR DISTRIBUTION DEPENDED ON THE RISING OR FALLING OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE
BY MAKING A LONG CIRCUIT OVER A NEIGHBOURING MOUNTAIN BUT THIS INDIAN HAVING BY CHANCE CROSSED HIS TRACK FOLLOWED IT FOR THE WHOLE DAY OVER DRY AND VERY STONY HILLS TILL AT LAST HE CAME ON HIS PREY HIDDEN IN A GULLY
WHICH HAVE SO LONG EXCITED THE ATTENTION OF VOYAGERS AS WELL AS IN THE NO LESS WONDERFUL BARRIER REEFS WHETHER ENCIRCLING SMALL ISLANDS OR STRETCHING FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES ALONG THE SHORES OF A CONTINENT ARE SIMPLY EXPLAINED
AND THUS LOSE PART OF THAT EASTERLY MOVEMENT WHICH IT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE GAINED FROM THE EARTH'S ROTATION AT MENDOZA ON THE EASTERN FOOT OF THE ANDES
AND SOMETIMES IN THE MOUNTAIN FORESTS WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT CEREMONIES THEY PERFORM JEMMY BUTTON WOULD NOT EAT LAND BIRDS BECAUSE EAT DEAD MEN THEY ARE UNWILLING EVEN TO MENTION THEIR DEAD FRIENDS WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY PERFORM ANY SORT OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP
APPEARS SO WILFULLY CRUEL ANOTHER DAY HAVING PLACED MYSELF BETWEEN A PENGUIN
SO THAT THE UNION OF SEPARATE INDIVIDUALS IN A COMMON BODY IS MORE STRIKING IN A CORALLINE THAN IN A TREE OUR CONCEPTION OF A COMPOUND ANIMAL WHERE IN SOME RESPECTS THE INDIVIDUALITY OF EACH IS NOT COMPLETED
WHAT A LIFE OF MISERY THESE MEN APPEAR TO US TO LEAD THEY WERE AT LEAST TEN LEAGUES FROM THE SAUCE POSTA AND SINCE THE MURDER COMMITTED BY THE INDIANS TWENTY FROM ANOTHER
RISES TO THE HEIGHT OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED FEET THE SURROUNDING ISLANDS ALL CONSIST OF CONICAL MASSES OF GREENSTONE ASSOCIATED SOMETIMES WITH LESS REGULAR HILLS OF BAKED AND ALTERED CLAY SLATE THIS PART OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO
TWO SPEARS WERE STUCK IN THE GROUND TWENTY FIVE YARDS APART BUT THEY WERE STRUCK AND ENTANGLED ONLY ONCE IN FOUR OR FIVE TIMES THE BALLS CAN BE THROWN FIFTY OR SIXTY YARDS BUT WITH LITTLE CERTAINTY
FOUR STOCK BROKERS TOOK VILLA RESIDENCES AT FLORENCE FOUR HUNDRED NOBODIES WERE RUINED AND AMONG THEM MISTER NICKLEBY THE VERY HOUSE I LIVE IN SIGHED THE POOR GENTLEMAN MAY BE TAKEN FROM ME TOMORROW
MADELINE'S HEART IS OCCUPIED GIVE ME YOUR HAND SIR IT IS OCCUPIED BY YOU AND WORTHILY AND NATURALLY THIS FORTUNE IS DESTINED TO BE YOURS BUT YOU HAVE A GREATER FORTUNE IN HER SIR THAN YOU WOULD HAVE IN MONEY WERE IT FORTY TIMES TOLD
WHICH THE GLANCE OF MISTER SQUEERS SO DISCONTENTEDLY WANDERED OR IN THE NARROW STREET INTO WHICH IT MIGHT HAVE PENETRATED IF HE HAD THOUGHT FIT TO APPROACH THE WINDOW
OUT QUITE OUT TO A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL GIRL FRESH LOVELY BEWITCHING AND NOT NINETEEN DARK EYES LONG EYELASHES
AND INTO WHICH SHE NOW LAUNCHED UNTIL HER BREATH WAS EXHAUSTED NEWMAN APPEARED NOT TO HEAR THESE REMARKS BUT PRECEDED THEM TO A COUPLE OF ROOMS ON THE FIRST FLOOR WHICH SOME KIND OF ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE TO RENDER HABITABLE
LEAVE ME SIR PRAY SAID THE YOUNG LADY I CANNOT
INASMUCH AS THE BORROWER MIGHT IN THE FORMER CASE BE VERY FAIRLY PRESUMED TO BE IN GREAT EXTREMITY OTHERWISE HE WOULD NOT BORROW AT ALL WITH SUCH ODDS AGAINST HIM THIS FACT IS INTERESTING
BY SOME FRAUD IT WAS ABSTRACTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS DECEASE AND THE OTHER THE ONLY WILL FOUND WAS PROVED AND ADMINISTERED FRIENDLY NEGOTIATIONS WHICH HAVE ONLY JUST NOW TERMINATED HAVE BEEN PROCEEDING SINCE THIS INSTRUMENT CAME INTO OUR HANDS
BOTH OF US DID BUSINESS WITH HIM WHY HE OWES YOU MONEY
I NEVER SEE ANYBODY SO LIGHT TO BE ALIVE NEVER SUCH MANNERS TOO SO PLAYFUL AND YET SO SEWERELY PROPER AS FOR HER FIGURE IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN SAID MISTER KENWIGS DROPPING HIS VOICE
THE SOUND OF A DEEP BELL CAME ALONG THE WIND ONE
IT'S A LONG TIME TO HAVE BEEN A LINGERING IN LONDON HE SAID
IF THAT IS ALL YOU COME ABOUT SIR SAID MISTER BRAY
HE COMPOSED HIMSELF FOR MORE SERIOUS BUSINESS AND ENTERED UPON THE PITH AND MARROW OF HIS NEGOTIATION FIRST HE DWELT UPON THE FACT THAT MADELINE BRAY WAS DEVOTED TO THE SUPPORT AND MAINTENANCE AND WAS A SLAVE TO EVERY WISH OF HER ONLY PARENT
WITH THAT HE JOCULARLY TAPPED MISSUS SLIDERSKEW UNDER THE CHIN AND APPEARED FOR THE MOMENT INCLINED TO CELEBRATE THE CLOSE OF HIS BACHELOR DAYS BY IMPRINTING A KISS ON HER SHRIVELLED LIPS
SAY RATHER WITH THE HELP OF DEVILS
AND ALL WAS SILENT STOPPED AGAIN THIS WITH THE LARGE BARE ROOM DAMP WALLS AND FLICKERING DOUBTFUL LIGHT COMBINED TO FORM A SCENE
IN ONE WERE A FEW CHAIRS A TABLE AN OLD HEARTH RUG AND SOME FADED BAIZE AND A FIRE WAS READY LAID IN THE GRATE IN THE OTHER STOOD AN OLD TENT BEDSTEAD AND A FEW SCANTY ARTICLES OF CHAMBER FURNITURE
SOME IN THE INTERESTING CONDITION IN WHICH MISSUS KENWIGS HAD LAST APPEARED IN PUBLIC RELATING THEIR EXPERIENCES OF SIMILAR OCCURRENCES SOME FEW ACQUIRED GREAT CREDIT FROM HAVING PROPHESIED THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY
THAT I OR ANY OTHER MAN CAN EVER URGE IN THIS IT SEEMS I JUDGED HASTILY AS YOU ALWAYS DO SIR CRIED BROTHER CHARLES UTTERLY FORGETTING HIS ASSUMED DIGNITY AS YOU ALWAYS DO
WHOM JEALOUSY OF NICHOLAS AND A SENSE OF HIS OWN TRIUMPH HAD CONVERTED INTO A PERFECT FIEND YOU THE DISAPPOINTED LOVER OH DEAR HE HE HE BUT YOU SHAN'T HAVE HER NOR SHE YOU
HE'S VERY RIGHT TIME IS MONEY TIME IS MONEY HE WAS ONE OF US WHO MADE THAT SAYING I SHOULD THINK SAID RALPH TIME IS MONEY AND VERY GOOD MONEY TOO TO THOSE WHO RECKON INTEREST BY IT
OH DEAR IF THE YOUNG LADY WOULD CONDESCENT ONLY THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS SAID ARTHUR HESITATING AND HALF RETREATING MADELINE SHRUNK INVOLUNTARILY FROM THE GOBLIN FIGURE BUT SHE PLACED THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS IN HIS HAND AND INSTANTLY WITHDREW THEM
OF THE DOOR AND THRUSTING HIS HEAD INTO A GARRET FAR MORE DEPLORABLE THAN THAT HE HAD JUST LEFT AND SEEING THAT THERE WAS NOBODY THERE BUT AN OLD WOMAN WHO WAS BENDING OVER A WRETCHED FIRE FOR ALTHOUGH THE WEATHER WAS STILL WARM THE EVENING WAS CHILLY WALKED IN AND TAPPED HER ON THE SHOULDER
AND MUST BE AGGRAVATED EVERY DAY AS HIS DETESTED CHARACTER OPENS UPON YOU MORE AND MORE SHRINK FROM THE LOATHSOME COMPANIONSHIP OF THIS WRETCH AS YOU WOULD FROM CORRUPTION AND DISEASE
AS SHE VERY LOGICALLY REMARKED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME YOUNG PERSON IN THAT WAY OF BUSINESS WHO HAD MADE A FORTUNE WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING TO BEGIN WITH AND THAT BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED WHY SHOULD NOT KATE DO THE SAME MISS LA CREEVY
EVEN HERE SAID NICHOLAS SOFTLY WE USED TO LOITER BEFORE WE KNEW WHAT DEATH WAS AND WHEN WE LITTLE THOUGHT WHOSE ASHES WOULD REST BENEATH AND WONDERING AT THE SILENCE SIT DOWN TO REST AND SPEAK BELOW OUR BREATH
MADELINE MY DEAR I DIDN'T KNOW THIS PERSON WAS IN YOUR DEBT A A TRIFLE I BELIEVE RETURNED MADELINE FAINTLY I SUPPOSE YOU THINK NOW SAID BRAY WHEELING HIS CHAIR ROUND AND CONFRONTING NICHOLAS
THAT'S THE WORST OF EVER BEING IN WITH A OWDACIOUS CHAP LIKE THAT OLD NICKLEBY
MISTER SQUEERS CONTINUED TO DO THIS FOR SOME TIME UNTIL THE INCREASING GLOOM WARNED HIM TO SNUFF THE CANDLE SEEMING TO BE SLIGHTLY ROUSED BY THIS EXERTION
OF ALL OTHERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE HANDS TO RESCUE HIS MISERABLE CHILD THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIS PROTECTOR AND FAITHFUL FRIEND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE SHOWN HIM THAT LOVE AND TENDERNESS WHICH FROM THE WRETCHED MOMENT OF HIS BIRTH HE HAD NEVER KNOWN
HE WAS ENABLED TO LEAVE TO HIS ELDEST SON RALPH THREE THOUSAND POUNDS IN CASH AND TO HIS YOUNGEST SON NICHOLAS ONE THOUSAND AND THE FARM WHICH WAS AS SMALL A LANDED ESTATE AS ONE WOULD DESIRE TO SEE
AND YET MORE STRONGLY AND DISTINCTLY MARKED AND BETTER REMEMBERED THAN THE HARDEST TRIALS OR SEVEREST SORROWS OF A YEAR AGO ONE OF THESE EXPEDITIONS LED THEM THROUGH THE CHURCHYARD WHERE WAS HIS FATHER'S GRAVE
WHICH NICHOLAS AT THE TIME THOROUGHLY BELIEVED TO BE THE MERE DELUSION OF AN IMAGINATION AFFECTED BY DISEASE BUT WHICH HE HAD AFTERWARDS TOO GOOD REASON TO KNOW WAS OF REAL AND ACTUAL OCCURRENCE
AND WERE FILLED WITH FIGURES OF MEN WOMEN AND MANY CHILDREN ALL WITH LIGHT UPON THEIR FACES THEN WHISPERED THAT IT WAS EDEN
WHICH NOBODY WHO HAS WORKED SUMS IN SIMPLE INTEREST CAN FAIL TO HAVE FOUND MOST EMBARRASSING BY ESTABLISHING THE ONE GENERAL RULE THAT ALL SUMS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST SHOULD BE PAID ON POCKET MONEY DAY THAT IS TO SAY ON SATURDAY
AND AFTER MANY SORROWFUL FAREWELLS AND A GREAT DEAL OF RUNNING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS ACROSS THE PAVEMENT ON THE PART OF MISS LA CREEVY IN THE COURSE OF WHICH THE YELLOW TURBAN CAME INTO VIOLENT CONTACT WITH SUNDRY FOOT PASSENGERS IT
QUITE RIDICULOUS CRIED THE DOCTOR SHE LOOKS A DEAL MORE LIKE HER OWN DAUGHTER SAID THE MARRIED LADY SO SHE DOES ASSENTED MISTER LUMBEY A GREAT DEAL MORE MISTER KENWIGS WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME FURTHER OBSERVATIONS
MISTER NICKLEBY'S INCOME AT THE PERIOD OF HIS MARRIAGE FLUCTUATED BETWEEN SIXTY AND EIGHTY POUNDS PER ANNUM THERE ARE PEOPLE ENOUGH IN THE WORLD HEAVEN KNOWS AND EVEN IN LONDON WHERE MISTER NICKLEBY DWELT IN THOSE DAYS
BROUGHT BACK MANY PAINFUL AND VIVID RECOLLECTIONS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE AND HIS HAD WANDERED FORTH FROM THEIR OLD HOME CAST UPON THE ROUGH WORLD AND THE MERCY OF STRANGERS IT NEEDED NO SUCH REFLECTIONS AS THOSE WHICH THE MEMORY OF OLD DAYS
AS THEY STOLE FARTHER AND FARTHER IN BY SLIGHT AND SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE DEGREES AND WITH SUCH CAUTION THAT THEY SCARCELY SEEMED TO BREATHE
I CAME HERE BECAUSE I WAS SHOWN THE WAY BY YOUR SERVANT I HAVE ADDRESSED YOU TWICE OR THRICE BUT YOU WERE TOO PROFOUNDLY ENGAGED WITH YOUR BOOK TO HEAR ME AND I HAVE BEEN SILENTLY WAITING UNTIL YOU SHOULD BE LESS ABSTRACTED WHAT I WANT I WILL TELL YOU
TO TURN TO A MORE PLEASANT SUBJECT IT MAY BE RIGHT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE TWO CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK WHICH ARE DRAWN FROM LIFE IT IS REMARKABLE THAT WHAT WE CALL THE WORLD WHICH IS SO VERY CREDULOUS IN WHAT PROFESSES TO BE TRUE
ARTHUR GRIDE PLUCKED AND FUMBLED AT HIS HAT AND DURST NOT RAISE HIS EYES FROM THE FLOOR
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT YOUR HINTING A WISH EVEN HINTING A WISH WOULD SURELY BE EQUIVALENT TO COMMANDING WHY OF COURSE IT WOULD RETORTED MISTER BRAY IN AN EXASPERATED TONE
YOU'LL STAND MY FRIEND AND HELP ME WON'T YOU THERE'S SOMETHING MORE SAID RALPH NO NO INDEED CRIED ARTHUR GRIDE YES YES INDEED I TELL YOU YES SAID RALPH
AS HE STROVE TO COMPOSE HIM NOTHING ELSE INDEED I KNOW BETTER I SAW AS PLAIN AS I SEE NOW WAS THE ANSWER OH SAY YOU'LL KEEP ME WITH YOU SWEAR YOU WON'T LEAVE ME FOR AN INSTANT DO I EVER LEAVE YOU RETURNED NICHOLAS
I COULD WISH THAT SOME FRIEND WOULD MENTION TO HER HOW VERY BADLY SHE HAS HER CAP TRIMMED AND WHAT VERY PREPOSTEROUS BOWS THOSE ARE BUT OF COURSE THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND IF SHE LIKES TO MAKE A FRIGHT OF HERSELF
A FOLLERING UP THIS HERE BLESSED OLD DOWAGER PETTY LARCENERER MISTER SQUEERS DELIVERED HIMSELF OF THIS EPITHET WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY AND EFFORT
WHICH THIS UNLUCKY PARAGRAPH BROUGHT DOWN UPON ME I SHOULD GET INTO AN ARITHMETICAL DIFFICULTY FROM WHICH I COULD NOT EASILY EXTRICATE MYSELF SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE THE APPLICATIONS FOR LOANS GIFTS
WHO HAVING RASHLY TAKEN CHARGE OF LITTLE LILLYVICK FOUND NOBODY DISPOSED TO RELIEVE HIM OF HIS PRECIOUS BURDEN ALL FRIENDS HERE NICHOLAS HEMMED ONCE OR TWICE
MOST PROBABLY IN CONFIRMATION OF THIS OPINION WHEN ANOTHER MARRIED LADY WHO HAD LOOKED IN TO KEEP UP MISSUS KENWIGS'S SPIRITS AND HELP TO CLEAR OFF ANYTHING IN THE EATING AND DRINKING WAY THAT MIGHT BE GOING ABOUT PUT IN HER HEAD TO ANNOUNCE
HE GNASHED HIS TEETH AND SMOTE THE AIR AND LOOKING WILDLY ROUND WITH EYES WHICH GLEAMED THROUGH THE DARKNESS CRIED ALOUD I AM TRAMPLED DOWN AND RUINED THE WRETCH TOLD ME TRUE
AND BEING GREATLY FATIGUED BOTH IN MIND AND BODY GRADUALLY FELL ASLEEP HE COULD NOT HAVE CLOSED HIS EYES FIVE MINUTES WHEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY A SCREAM AND STARTING UP IN THAT KIND OF TERROR WHICH AFFECTS A PERSON SUDDENLY ROUSED
WHO WAS A SLOW AND TIME TAKING SPEAKER IF WE SHOULD LOSE IT WE SHALL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO LIVE MY DEAR FIDDLE SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY I AM NOT ALTOGETHER SURE OF THAT MY DEAR SAID MISTER NICKLEBY
I KNEW YOU COULDN'T FORGET HIM WHEN YOU CAME TO THINK FOR A MOMENT HE SAID YOU WERE RIGHT
I WOULDN'T BE ABSURD MY DEAR IF I WERE YOU REPLIED MISSUS NICKLEBY IN A LOFTY MANNER BECAUSE IT'S NOT BY ANY MEANS BECOMING AND DOESN'T SUIT YOU AT ALL
YOUR TEARS FALL FASTER AS YOU TALK OF HAPPINESS SAID NICHOLAS AND YOU SHUN THE CONTEMPLATION OF THAT DARK FUTURE WHICH MUST BE LADEN WITH SO MUCH MISERY TO YOU DEFER THIS MARRIAGE FOR A WEEK FOR BUT ONE WEEK
AND SUCH SCANTY TROUSERS AS DISPLAYED HIS SHRUNKEN SPINDLE SHANKS IN THEIR FULL UGLINESS THE ONLY ARTICLES OF DISPLAY OR ORNAMENT IN HIS DRESS WERE A STEEL WATCH CHAIN TO WHICH WERE ATTACHED SOME LARGE GOLD SEALS
HAVING BUT ONE OUTLET IT WAS TRAVERSED BY FEW BUT THE INHABITANTS AT ANY TIME AND THE NIGHT BEING ONE OF THOSE ON WHICH MOST PEOPLE ARE GLAD TO BE WITHIN DOORS
HE LISTENED TO THE MAN'S RETREATING FOOTSTEPS UNTIL THE SOUND HAD PASSED AND THEN GAZING UP INTO THE SKY SAW OR THOUGHT HE SAW THE SAME BLACK CLOUD
HAVE YOU NO REGARD FOR YOUR BABY NO RETURNED MISTER KENWIGS MORE SHAME FOR YOU RETORTED THE NURSE UGH YOU UNNATURAL MONSTER
SUCH WAS OLD ARTHUR GRIDE IN WHOSE FACE THERE WAS NOT A WRINKLE IN WHOSE DRESS THERE WAS NOT ONE SPARE FOLD OR PLAIT BUT EXPRESSED THE MOST COVETOUS AND GRIPING PENURY AND SUFFICIENTLY INDICATED HIS BELONGING TO THAT CLASS OF WHICH RALPH NICKLEBY WAS A MEMBER
AND HE HAD GROWN UP BENEATH HIS EYE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CARELESS INDIFFERENT ROUGH HARSH FATHER LIKE ENOUGH HE FELT THAT BUT THE THOUGHT WOULD COME THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE
OR REFERENCES TO READY RECKONERS HIS SIMPLE RULE OF INTEREST BEING ALL COMPRISED IN THE ONE GOLDEN SENTENCE TWO PENCE FOR EVERY HALF PENNY WHICH GREATLY SIMPLIFIED THE ACCOUNTS AND WHICH AS A FAMILIAR PRECEPT
I WOULDN'T DECEIVE YOU YOU KNOW WHINED ARTHUR GRIDE I COULDN'T DO IT I SHOULD BE MAD TO TRY I
AND HAND IT OVER TO YOU
DRIVING HIM FROM PLACE TO PLACE IN A LITTLE PONY CHAIR AND SUPPORTING HIM ON HIS ARM WHILE THEY WALKED SLOWLY AMONG THESE OLD HAUNTS OR LINGERED IN THE SUNLIGHT TO TAKE LONG PARTING LOOKS OF THOSE WHICH WERE MOST QUIET AND BEAUTIFUL
CHAPTER ELEVEN NEWMAN NOGGS INDUCTS MISSUS AND MISS NICKLEBY INTO THEIR NEW DWELLING IN THE CITY MISS NICKLEBY'S REFLECTIONS AS SHE WENDED HER WAY HOMEWARDS
AS IF HE WOULD PREFER ITS ALL COMING HOME TO HIM AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GOT BY IT BUT HE SAID NOTHING AND RESTING HIS HEAD UPON HIS HAND SUBSIDED INTO A KIND OF DOZE THEN THE MATRONS AGAIN
HE LOOKED IN MY SLEEP WHEN I WAS QUITE A LITTLE CHILD AND HAS LOOKED IN MY SLEEP EVER SINCE AS HE DID JUST NOW NICHOLAS ENDEAVOURED BY EVERY PERSUASION AND ARGUMENT HE COULD THINK OF TO CONVINCE THE TERRIFIED CREATURE THAT HIS IMAGINATION HAD DECEIVED HIM
LORD MY DEAR REPLIED MISSUS NICKLEBY DON'T TALK IN THAT WAY OR YOU'LL FRIGHTEN ME TO DEATH IT IS ONLY MY FOOLISH FANCY MAMA SAID KATE FORCING A SMILE WELL THEN MY LOVE I WISH YOU WOULD KEEP YOUR FOOLISH FANCY TO YOURSELF
WELL IT'S A PLEASANT THING NOW TO THINK THAT YOU REMEMBER OLD TIMES OH DEAR NOW THEN SAID RALPH COMPOSEDLY WHAT'S IN THE WIND I ASK AGAIN WHAT IS IT SEE THAT NOW CRIED THE OTHER
BUT THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE I AM HIS DETAINING CREDITOR FOR SEVENTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS YOU TALK AS IF YOU WERE THE ONLY DETAINING CREDITOR SAID RALPH PULLING OUT HIS POCKET BOOK I AM ANOTHER FOR
THERE ARE CERTAIN POLITE FORMS AND CEREMONIES WHICH MUST BE OBSERVED IN CIVILISED LIFE OR MANKIND RELAPSE INTO THEIR ORIGINAL BARBARISM NO GENTEEL LADY WAS EVER YET CONFINED INDEED
SOME WHAT ASKED PEG SOME MONEY ROARED SQUEERS
HAVING BEEN UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH A FEW MONTHS BEFORE TO SAVE THE LIFE OF A POOR RELATION TO WHOM HE PAID A WEEKLY ALLOWANCE OF THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE HE HAD IN A FIT OF VERY NATURAL EXASPERATION
WITH EACH RETURNING SUN SOME NEW OBSTACLE TO SURMOUNT SOME NEW HEIGHT TO BE ATTAINED DISTANCES STRETCH OUT BEFORE HIM WHICH LAST NIGHT WERE SCARCELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND THE LIGHT WHICH GILDS ALL NATURE WITH ITS CHEERFUL BEAMS
YOUR HEALTH SLIDER AND EMPTY IT
TRUSTING TO OUR HOLDING HIM FAST ENOUGH I WARRANT YOU WE BOTH FELL INTO THE SAME SNARE OH DEAR WHAT A PITFALL IT WAS IT ALMOST RUINED ME AND LENT HIM OUR MONEY UPON BILLS WITH ONLY ONE NAME BESIDES HIS OWN WHICH TO BE SURE EVERYBODY SUPPOSED TO BE A GOOD ONE
THAT ON SUCH A DAY WE ARE TO EAT AND DRINK IN THEIR HOUSE AND THAT ITS INTENT AND OBJECT IS TO CONFER PLEASURE UPON US SAID NICHOLAS AND THAT'S ALL YOU CONCLUDE IT IS MY DEAR I HAVE NOT YET ARRIVED AT ANYTHING DEEPER MOTHER
EVIL IT BE HAS BEEN OF MY OWN SEEKING I AM IMPELLED TO THIS COURSE BY NO ONE BUT FOLLOW IT OF MY OWN FREE WILL YOU SEE I AM NOT CONSTRAINED OR FORCED REPORT THIS SAID MADELINE TO MY DEAR FRIEND AND BENEFACTOR
AND LEFT IT ALL TO MISTER GODFREY NICKLEBY WITH A SPECIAL MENTION OF HIS INDIGNATION NOT ONLY AGAINST THE SOCIETY FOR SAVING THE POOR RELATION'S LIFE BUT AGAINST THE POOR RELATION ALSO FOR ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE SAVED
SO MISTER RALPH NICKLEBY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID THINGS WERE BETTER AS THEY WERE AS FOR NICHOLAS HE LIVED A SINGLE MAN ON THE PATRIMONIAL ESTATE UNTIL HE GREW TIRED OF LIVING ALONE
AND THE HAND WAS PRESSED MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE OR THRICE BEFORE HE SANK TO REST AND SLOWLY LOOSED HIS HOLD IN A FORTNIGHT'S TIME HE BECAME TOO ILL TO MOVE ABOUT ONCE OR TWICE NICHOLAS DROVE HIM OUT
WELL WELL SAID BROTHER CHARLES GO INTO THAT ROOM MY DEAR THAT DOOR YONDER AND SEE IF THERE'S NOT A LETTER FOR YOU FROM HER I THINK THERE'S ONE UPON THE TABLE YOU NEEDN'T HURRY BACK MY LOVE IF THERE IS
WHO HAD NO OTHER FRIEND ON EARTH TO WHICH RALPH REJOINED THAT HE HAD HEARD SOMETHING OF THE KIND BEFORE AND THAT IF SHE HAD KNOWN A LITTLE MORE OF THE WORLD SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SUCH A FOOL
THE DASHING MAN WHO USED HIS HANDSOME WIFE SO ILL IF YOU SEEK TO RECALL ANY PARTICULAR DASHING MAN TO MY RECOLLECTION BY SUCH A TRAIT AS THAT SAID RALPH SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS
THAT WHENEVER HE DIED HE WOULD WISH TO BE BURIED WHERE HIS DEAR LITTLE CHILD HAD LAID HER HEAD YOU SEE HIS WISH WAS NOT FORGOTTEN NOTHING MORE PASSED AT THE TIME BUT THAT NIGHT AS NICHOLAS SAT BESIDE HIS BED
AND ATTACH HIMSELF TO THE QUIET ROUTINE OF A COUNTRY LIFE RALPH THE ELDER DEDUCED FROM THE OFTEN REPEATED TALE THE TWO GREAT MORALS THAT RICHES ARE THE ONLY TRUE SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AND POWER
HAVING SEEN HIM SOUND ASLEEP AND HEARD HIM SNORE MOST SATISFACTORILY AND HAVING FURTHER PRESIDED OVER THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TOYS TO THE PERFECT CONTENTMENT OF ALL THE LITTLE KENWIGSES NICHOLAS TOOK HIS LEAVE
HIS FACE WAS SHRIVELLED AND YELLOW SAVE WHERE THE CHEEKS WERE STREAKED WITH THE COLOUR OF A DRY WINTER APPLE AND WHERE HIS BEARD HAD BEEN THERE LINGERED YET A FEW GREY TUFTS WHICH SEEMED LIKE THE RAGGED EYEBROWS TO DENOTE THE BADNESS OF THE SOIL FROM WHICH THEY SPRUNG
HOW DARE YOU THINK FRANK THAT WE WOULD HAVE YOU MARRY FOR MONEY WHEN YOUTH BEAUTY AND EVERY AMIABLE VIRTUE AND EXCELLENCE WERE TO BE HAD FOR LOVE HOW DARED YOU FRANK GO AND MAKE LOVE TO MISTER NICKLEBY'S SISTER WITHOUT TELLING US FIRST WHAT YOU MEANT TO DO
THEN I TELL YOU SERIOUSLY THAT I AM SAID OLD ARTHUR AND I TELL YOU SERIOUSLY REJOINED RALPH WHAT I TOLD YOU THIS MINUTE STAY LET ME LOOK AT YOU THERE'S A LIQUORISH DEVILRY IN YOUR FACE WHAT IS THIS
WHICH I'M FORCED TO THROW INTO THE FIRE HALLO
AT LENGTH AFTER FIVE YEARS WHEN MISSUS NICKLEBY HAD PRESENTED HER HUSBAND WITH A COUPLE OF SONS AND THAT EMBARRASSED GENTLEMAN IMPRESSED WITH THE NECESSITY OF MAKING SOME PROVISION FOR HIS FAMILY
AND THAT IT IS LAWFUL AND JUST TO COMPASS THEIR ACQUISITION BY ALL MEANS SHORT OF FELONY AND REASONED RALPH WITH HIMSELF IF NO GOOD CAME OF MY UNCLE'S MONEY WHEN HE WAS ALIVE
TO TELL THAT THEY HAD SPRUNG FROM PAUPERS BODIES AND HAD STRUCK THEIR ROOTS IN THE GRAVES OF MEN SODDEN WHILE ALIVE IN STEAMING COURTS AND DRUNKEN HUNGRY DENS
MISTER SQUEERS PLYING MISSUS SLIDERSKEW FREELY WITH THE LIQUOR
HE INSTITUTED A STRICT INQUIRY WHETHER ANY STRANGER HAD BEEN SEEN AND SEARCHED HIMSELF BEHIND THE TREE AND THROUGH THE ORCHARD AND UPON THE LAND IMMEDIATELY ADJOINING AND IN EVERY PLACE NEAR WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR A MAN TO LIE CONCEALED BUT ALL IN VAIN
THERE ARE SOME RELATIONS OF MISSUS KENWIGS'S SAID MISTER KENWIGS TAKING A PINCH OF SNUFF FROM THE DOCTOR'S BOX AND THEN SNEEZING VERY HARD FOR HE WASN'T USED TO IT THAT MIGHT LEAVE THEIR HUNDRED POUND APIECE TO TEN PEOPLE
WHETHER AS IT'S A BOY I WON'T HAVE IT IN THE PAPERS PONDERING UPON THE ADVISABILITY OF THIS STEP
A DENSE AND SQUALID CROWD HERE THEY LAY CHEEK BY JOWL WITH LIFE NO DEEPER DOWN THAN THE FEET OF THE THRONG THAT PASSED THERE EVERY DAY AND PILED HIGH AS THEIR THROATS
ONCE KATE WAS LOST AND AFTER AN HOUR OF FRUITLESS SEARCH THEY FOUND HER FAST ASLEEP UNDER THAT TREE WHICH SHADES MY FATHER'S GRAVE HE WAS VERY FOND OF HER AND SAID WHEN HE TOOK HER UP IN HIS ARMS STILL SLEEPING
NEWMAN NOGGS BOWING TO THE YOUNG LADY MORE LIKE A GENTLEMAN THAN THE MISERABLE WRETCH HE SEEMED PLACED HIS HAND UPON HIS BREAST AND PAUSING FOR A MOMENT WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO STRUGGLES TO SPEAK BUT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT TO SAY QUITTED THE ROOM
IT'S A VERY SMALL PROPERTY IT IS INDEED SAY THE TEN SHILLINGS AND WE'LL CLOSE THE BARGAIN IT'S MORE THAN I OUGHT TO GIVE BUT YOU'RE SO KIND SHALL WE SAY THE TEN DO NOW DO
IF YOU DIED INDEED THE PEOPLE YOU HATE WOULD MAKE HER HAPPY BUT CAN YOU BEAR THE THOUGHT OF THAT NO RETURNED BRAY URGED BY A VINDICTIVE IMPULSE HE COULD NOT REPRESS I SHOULD IMAGINE NOT INDEED SAID RALPH QUIETLY
AND SHUT HIMSELF UP INTENDING TO SLIP OUT DIRECTLY RALPH WAS SAFE INSIDE HIS OWN ROOM NOGGS CRIED RALPH WHERE IS THAT FELLOW NOGGS BUT NOT A WORD SAID NEWMAN
ALL RIGHT AND VERY LAUDABLE SAID SQUEERS BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST SLIDER BURN THE BOX YOU SHOULD NEVER KEEP THINGS AS MAY LEAD TO DISCOVERY ALWAYS MIND THAT
THE MATRONS DROPPED OFF ONE BY ONE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SIX OR EIGHT PARTICULAR FRIENDS WHO HAD DETERMINED TO STOP ALL NIGHT THE LIGHTS IN THE HOUSES GRADUALLY DISAPPEARED
THIS MUFFLING OF THE KNOCKER WAS THOROUGHLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE BUT KNOCKERS MAY BE MUFFLED FOR OTHER PURPOSES THAN THOSE OF MERE UTILITARIANISM AS IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE WAS CLEARLY SHOWN
AND TAKING THE CANDLE DOWN BESIDE HIM MISTER SQUEERS WITH GREAT EAGERNESS AND A CUNNING GRIN OVERSPREADING HIS FACE ENTERED UPON HIS TASK OF EXAMINATION IF THE OLD WOMAN HAD NOT BEEN VERY DEAF SHE MUST HAVE HEARD WHEN SHE LAST WENT TO THE DOOR
FROM WHAT WE HAVE SAID OF THIS YOUNG GENTLEMAN AND THE NATURAL ADMIRATION THE READER WILL IMMEDIATELY CONCEIVE OF HIS CHARACTER IT MAY PERHAPS BE INFERRED THAT HE IS TO BE THE HERO OF THE WORK WHICH WE SHALL PRESENTLY BEGIN TO SET THIS POINT AT REST
THEY REMAINED QUITE STILL AND NOW NOT ONLY APPEARED UNOBSERVED AT THE DOOR WHICH WAS NOT BOLTED FOR THE BOLT HAD NO HASP BUT WARILY AND WITH NOISELESS FOOTSTEPS ADVANCED INTO THE ROOM
WE NEED DETAIN YOU NO LONGER I THINK SAID KATE IS THERE NOTHING I CAN DO ASKED NEWMAN NOTHING THANK YOU REJOINED MISS NICKLEBY PERHAPS MY DEAR
YES YES CRIED ARTHUR GRIDE SHADING HIS EYES WITH HIS HAND IT IS A MAN AND NOT A SPIRIT IT IS A MAN ROBBERS ROBBERS FOR WHAT ARE THESE CRIES RAISED UNLESS INDEED YOU KNOW ME AND HAVE SOME PURPOSE IN YOUR BRAIN
MISSUS KENWIGS WILL BE GLAD TO HEAR FROM HER
SAID HER FATHER GENTLY DISENGAGING HIMSELF IT WAS NOTHING
I'LL CRY ROBBERS THIEVES MURDER ALARM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD STRUGGLE WITH YOU LET LOOSE SOME BLOOD AND SWEAR YOU CAME TO ROB ME IF YOU DON'T QUIT MY HOUSE REPLIED GRIDE DRAWING IN HIS HEAD WITH A FRIGHTFUL GRIN I WILL WRETCH CRIED NICHOLAS
WHICH HOWEVER HARMLESS IN ITSELF
PROPPED UP WITH PILLOWS BUT THE MOTION OF THE CHAISE WAS PAINFUL TO HIM AND BROUGHT ON FITS OF FAINTING WHICH IN HIS WEAKENED STATE WERE DANGEROUS THERE WAS AN OLD COUCH IN THE HOUSE WHICH WAS HIS FAVOURITE RESTING PLACE BY DAY AND WHEN THE SUN SHONE
WHEN THERE CAME ONE EVENING PER FAVOUR OF MISTER LINKINWATER AN INVITATION FROM THE BROTHERS TO DINNER ON THE NEXT DAY BUT ONE COMPREHENDING NOT ONLY MISSUS NICKLEBY KATE AND NICHOLAS BUT LITTLE MISS LA CREEVY WHO WAS MOST PARTICULARLY MENTIONED
HE SHOOK HANDS AND WENT AWAY I NEVER SAW HIM AFTERWARDS BUT I SOMETIMES IMAGINE THAT I DESCRY A FAINT REFLECTION OF HIM IN JOHN BROWDIE IN REFERENCE TO THESE GENTRY I MAY HERE QUOTE A FEW WORDS FROM THE ORIGINAL PREFACE TO THIS BOOK
AND THAT SHE SHOULD COMMAND AND I SHOULD OBEY HINT A WISH TOO PERHAPS YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU SEE ME IN THIS PLACE AND SCARCELY ABLE TO LEAVE THIS CHAIR WITHOUT ASSISTANCE THAT I AM SOME BROKEN SPIRITED DEPENDENT CREATURE
OH RETURNED OLD ARTHUR FEIGNING TO BE SUDDENLY ENLIGHTENED YOU MEAN SOMETHING MORE AS CONCERNS MYSELF AND MY INTENTION AY SURELY SURELY SHALL I MENTION THAT I THINK YOU HAD BETTER
THIS GOOD LADY BORE HIM TWO CHILDREN A SON AND A DAUGHTER AND WHEN THE SON WAS ABOUT NINETEEN AND THE DAUGHTER FOURTEEN AS NEAR AS WE CAN GUESS IMPARTIAL RECORDS OF YOUNG LADIES AGES BEING BEFORE THE PASSING OF THE NEW ACT
THAT HE WOULD NOT THINK OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED UNTIL HE GOT HOME HE WAS AT HOME NOW AND SUFFERED HIMSELF TO CONSIDER IT HIS OWN CHILD HIS OWN CHILD
HOW ODD THINGS COME ABOUT NOW THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE MET HER IN THE COUNTRY WELL HEARING THIS MENTION OF THEIR OLD FRIEND'S NAME THE FOUR MISS KENWIGSES GATHERED ROUND NICHOLAS OPEN EYED AND MOUTHED
IN A TONE OF INTEREST WHICH WENT TO THE VERY HEART AND SOUL OF THE NURSE WHO HAD COME IN TO WARM SOME MYSTERIOUS COMPOUND IN A LITTLE SAUCEPAN OVER THE FIRE I OUGHT TO MAKE A HUNDRED APOLOGIES TO YOU FOR CALLING AT SUCH A SEASON SAID NICHOLAS
THIS SAID SQUEERS IS A BUNDLE OF OVERDUE ACCEPTANCES AND RENEWED BILLS OF SIX OR EIGHT YOUNG GENTLEMEN BUT THEY'RE ALL M P SO IT'S OF NO USE TO ANYBODY THROW IT IN THE FIRE
LAID BY SOMEWHERES SAFE THAT'S ALL RETURNED SQUEERS BUT EVERYBODY'S THE BEST JUDGE OF THEIR OWN AFFAIRS ALL I SAY IS SLIDER I WOULDN'T DO IT COME SAID PEG
BUT WHEN WE COME FRESH UPON SUCH THINGS IN THE MORNING WITH THAT DARK AND SILENT GAP BETWEEN US AND YESTERDAY WITH EVERY LINK IN THE BRITTLE CHAIN OF HOPE TO RIVET AFRESH
THE DOOR AND WINDOWS OF WHICH WERE SO BESPATTERED WITH MUD THAT IT WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN UNINHABITED FOR YEARS THE DOOR OF THIS DESERTED MANSION NEWMAN OPENED WITH A KEY WHICH HE TOOK OUT OF HIS HAT
THE PLAYERS SEE LITTLE OR NOTHING OF THEIR CARDS AT FIRST STARTING GAINS MAY BE GREAT AND SO MAY LOSSES THE RUN OF LUCK WENT AGAINST MISTER NICKLEBY A MANIA PREVAILED A BUBBLE BURST
AS NOT ONE OF THEM HAD EVER CHANCED TO HEAR THEIR NAMES BEFORE THE OLD BUTLER RECEIVED THEM WITH PROFOUND RESPECT AND MANY SMILES AND USHERED THEM INTO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE THEY WERE RECEIVED BY THE BROTHERS WITH SO MUCH CORDIALITY AND KINDNESS
THE BROTHERS CHEERYBLE MAKE VARIOUS DECLARATIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND OTHERS TIM LINKINWATER MAKES A DECLARATION FOR HIMSELF SOME WEEKS HAD PASSED AND THE FIRST SHOCK OF THESE EVENTS HAD SUBSIDED
IN THE MIDST OF THIS GENERAL HUBBUB DOCTOR LUMBEY SAT IN THE FIRST FLOOR FRONT AS BEFORE RELATED NURSING THE DEPOSED BABY AND TALKING TO MISTER KENWIGS HE WAS A STOUT BLUFF LOOKING GENTLEMAN
SOME FELLOWS FULL OF DRINK FOLLOWED BY OTHERS WHO WERE REMONSTRATING WITH THEM AND URGING THEM TO GO HOME IN QUIET THEY WERE IN HIGH GOOD HUMOUR AND ONE OF THEM A LITTLE WEAZEN HUMP BACKED MAN
INTERRUPTED MISTER BRAY WITH AN IRRITABLE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IT REALLY RESTED WITH HIM TO DECIDE IT IS FOR MY DAUGHTER TO ACCEPT OR REJECT IT IS FOR MY DAUGHTER YOU KNOW THAT TRUE SAID RALPH EMPHATICALLY
I CAN BE ALL HE SEEKS IN ME AND WILL HE IS CONTENT TO TAKE ME AS I AM I HAVE PASSED MY WORD AND SHOULD REJOICE NOT WEEP THAT IT IS SO I DO
BUT ONE LAST LINGERING CARE FOR YOUR OWN PEACE OF MIND AND HEART I DO FOR GOD'S SAKE URGE YOU TO GIVE ME A HEARING SHE ATTEMPTED TO PASS HIM BUT NICHOLAS GENTLY DETAINED HER A HEARING SAID NICHOLAS I ASK YOU BUT TO HEAR ME NOT ME ALONE BUT HIM FOR WHOM I SPEAK
WHAT IS THERE I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS THE NEAREST CHURCHYARD BUT A GRAVESTONE THERE WHEREVER IT IS AND A DATE PERHAPS TWO YEARS HENCE PERHAPS TWENTY THAT'S ALL MISTER BRAY RESTED HIS ELBOW ON THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR AND SHADED HIS FACE WITH HIS HAND
REPRESSING WITH AS GOOD A GRACE AS POSSIBLE THESE LITTLE FAMILIARITIES FOR WHICH THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THE BLACK BOTTLE WAS AT LEAST AS MUCH TO BLAME AS ANY CONSTITUTIONAL INFIRMITY ON THE PART OF MISSUS SLIDERSKEW HE PROTESTED THAT HE HAD ONLY BEEN JOKING
MATCHES ARE MADE IN HEAVEN THEY SAY ADDED ARTHUR GRIDE LEERING HIDEOUSLY AT THE FATHER IN LAW HE WANTED IF WE ARE MARRIED IT WILL BE DESTINY ACCORDING TO THAT
WHICH NO AID COULD PREVENT MY DOING IF I ONCE GRAPPLED WITH YOU I HAVE BEEN NO LOVER OF THIS LADY'S NO CONTRACT OR ENGAGEMENT NO WORD OF LOVE HAS EVER PASSED BETWEEN US SHE DOES NOT EVEN KNOW MY NAME I'LL ASK IT FOR ALL THAT I'LL BEG IT OF HER
THAT IS TO SAY THE COACH NOT THE TURBAN WENT AWAY AGAIN WITH THE TWO LADIES AND THEIR LUGGAGE INSIDE AND NEWMAN DESPITE ALL MISSUS NICKLEBY'S ASSURANCES THAT IT WOULD BE HIS DEATH ON THE BOX BESIDE THE DRIVER THEY WENT INTO THE CITY
AND THAT IT WAS THERE HE HAD BEEN LAST SEEN THEY AGREED TO LOOK THERE TOO AND WENT UP SOFTLY FOR THE MYSTERY AND SILENCE MADE THEM TIMID
AND FLOWED IN PART FROM THE BLACK BOTTLE WAS HERE INTERRUPTED BY MISSUS SLIDERSKEW
OF FIRST RATE STANDING AND UNDERSTANDING TOO
FATTENED UPON HIS OLD DEFIANCE AND SUCCESS THERE WERE REASONS FOR ITS INCREASE IT HAD GROWN AND STRENGTHENED GRADUALLY NOW IT ATTAINED A HEIGHT WHICH WAS SHEER WILD LUNACY
DO YOU THINK HE COULD RESIST ME AND IF HE COULD NOT RESIST ME DO YOU THINK HIS DAUGHTER COULD RESIST HIM SHOULDN'T I HAVE HER MISSUS ARTHUR GRIDE
SOME BONES OF ANIMALS FRAGMENTS OF IRON HOOPS AND STAVES OF OLD CASKS LAY STREWN ABOUT BUT NO LIFE WAS STIRRING THERE IT WAS A PICTURE OF COLD SILENT DECAY THIS HOUSE DEPRESSES AND CHILLS ONE SAID KATE
IN ALMOST EVERY WEEK OF THE YEAR I SHALL BE SORRY TRULY SORRY TO LEAVE YOU MY KIND FRIEND SAID KATE ON WHOM THE GOOD FEELING OF THE POOR MINIATURE PAINTER HAD MADE A DEEP IMPRESSION
AND MARRIAGES THAT ARE MADE IN HELL AND TOLL RUEFULLY FOR THE DEAD WHOSE SHOES ARE WORN ALREADY
HE'S A TREACHEROUS OLD GOAT SAID PEG AND COZENED ME WITH CUNNING TRICKS AND LYING PROMISES BUT NEVER MIND I'M EVEN WITH HIM I'M EVEN WITH HIM
WITH A VISION OF A HOT MESSENGER TEARING UP TO THE DOOR TO ANNOUNCE THAT NICHOLAS HAD BEEN TAKEN INTO PARTNERSHIP QUITTED THAT BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT AND ENTERED UPON A NEW ONE IT'S A VERY EXTRAORDINARY THING SHE SAID A MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING
MISSUS SLIDERSKEW DIDN'T KNOW BUT SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS POSSIBLY BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T HELP IT
THE AMIABLE OLD GENTLEMAN IT SEEMED HAD INTENDED TO LEAVE THE WHOLE TO THE ROYAL HUMANE SOCIETY AND HAD INDEED EXECUTED A WILL TO THAT EFFECT BUT THE INSTITUTION
AH HE'D HAVE MADE A GOOD UN IN OUR LINE BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO LIMITED FOR HIM HIS GENIUS WOULD HAVE BUSTED ALL BONDS AND COMING OVER EVERY OBSTACLE BROKE DOWN ALL BEFORE IT TILL IT ERECTED ITSELF INTO A MONNEYMENT OF WELL
WAS SERIOUSLY REVOLVING IN HIS MIND A LITTLE COMMERCIAL SPECULATION OF INSURING HIS LIFE NEXT QUARTER DAY AND THEN FALLING FROM THE TOP OF THE MONUMENT BY ACCIDENT THERE CAME ONE MORNING BY THE GENERAL POST
BUT FEW COMPLAINTS PREVAIL OF THE POPULATION BEING SCANTY IT IS EXTRAORDINARY HOW LONG A MAN MAY LOOK AMONG THE CROWD WITHOUT DISCOVERING THE FACE OF A FRIEND BUT IT IS NO LESS TRUE MISTER NICKLEBY LOOKED AND LOOKED
I RECOLLECT HE WAS A JOVIAL RUDDY BROAD FACED MAN THAT WE GOT ACQUAINTED DIRECTLY AND THAT WE TALKED ON ALL KINDS OF SUBJECTS EXCEPT THE SCHOOL WHICH HE SHOWED A GREAT ANXIETY TO AVOID
IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF BY THIS TIME IN AN EXTREMELY CHEERFUL STATE AND QUITE ENOUGH EXCITED FOR HIS PURPOSE WHAT THIS PURPOSE WAS SOON APPEARED FOR AFTER A FEW TURNS ABOUT THE ROOM TO STEADY HIMSELF
AFTER AN INEFFECTUAL CLUTCH INTENDED TO DETAIN AND CARRY THEM TO HIS LIPS OLD ARTHUR GAVE HIS OWN FINGERS A MUMBLING KISS AND WITH MANY AMOROUS DISTORTIONS OF VISAGE WENT IN PURSUIT OF HIS FRIEND WHO WAS BY THIS TIME IN THE STREET
AND FURTHER PERSISTING IN SENDING THE SERVANT GIRL FOR A COACH FOR FEAR HE SHOULD BRING ON ANOTHER ATTACK OF HIS DISORDER TO BOTH CONDITIONS NEWMAN WAS COMPELLED TO YIELD PRESENTLY THE COACH CAME
WHO COULD SCARCELY GO ASTRAY BE THEY VICIOUS AS THEY WOULD TURNED HAUGHTILY FROM THE CRUSHED AND STRICKEN WRETCH WHO COULD SCARCE DO OTHERWISE AND WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREATER WONDER HAD HE OR SHE DONE WELL THAN EVEN THEY HAD THEY DONE ILL
BUT HE CAME DOWN AT NIGHT THROUGH THE SNOW TO THE INN WHERE I WAS STAYING IT WAS AFTER DINNER AND HE NEEDED LITTLE PERSUASION TO SIT DOWN BY THE FIRE IN A WARM CORNER
WHEN THROUGH SOME FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY GET THE UPPER HAND FOR A BRIEF DAY OR THINK THEY GET THE UPPER HAND OF A GENTLEMAN MY BUSINESS SAID NICHOLAS RESPECTFULLY IS WITH A LADY
THAT GIRL GROWS MORE LIKE HER MOTHER EVERY DAY SAID MISTER LUMBEY SUDDENLY STRICKEN WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRATION OF MORLEENA
VERY POSSIBLY THE YOUNG LADY MIGHT BE DENIED ALTHOUGH TO HIM SHE NEVER HAD BEEN AND HE WAS STILL PONDERING UPON THE SUREST METHOD OF OBTAINING ACCESS TO HER IN THAT CASE WHEN COMING TO THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE HE FOUND IT HAD BEEN LEFT AJAR
MISTER NOGGS WOULD LIKE TO DRINK OUR HEALTHS SAID MISSUS NICKLEBY FUMBLING IN HER RETICULE FOR SOME SMALL COIN I THINK MAMA SAID KATE HESITATING AND REMARKING NEWMAN'S AVERTED FACE YOU WOULD HURT HIS FEELINGS IF YOU OFFERED IT
THAT HE MAY GIVE WHATEVER HE OWES US TO THE FIRST BEGGAR THAT PASSES HIS SHOP OR ADD IT TO HIS OWN PROFITS NEXT TIME HE CALCULATES THEM AND THAT HE MAY GO TO THE DEVIL FOR ME THAT'S MY ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF HIS ORDERS SIR
THERE IS NO RETREAT SAID NICHOLAS IN AN AGONY OF SUPPLICATION NO WITHDRAWING ALL REGRET WILL BE UNAVAILING AND DEEP AND BITTER IT MUST BE WHAT CAN I SAY THAT WILL INDUCE YOU TO PAUSE AT THIS LAST MOMENT WHAT CAN I DO TO SAVE YOU
WHO ON HER KNEES BEFORE THE FIRE WAS FEEDING IT WITH FRAGMENTS OF THE BOX AND GRINNING IN MOST DEVILISH EXULTATION
WITH NO SHIRT COLLAR TO SPEAK OF AND A BEARD THAT HAD BEEN GROWING SINCE YESTERDAY MORNING FOR DOCTOR LUMBEY WAS POPULAR AND THE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS PROLIFIC AND THERE HAD BEEN NO LESS THAN THREE OTHER KNOCKERS MUFFLED ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITHIN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS
TILL HE FOUND OUT WHERE THIS PRECIOUS MISSUS PEG WAS HID AND CLEARED THE GROUND FOR ME TO WORK UPON
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE RESULT OF THAT WOULD BE I CAN TELL YOU IT ALL BEFOREHAND AND A WICKED LIGHT GLEAMED IN HER EYES THAT HAD BEEN SO SOFT A MINUTE BEFORE
OF THE MEASURES THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS BY THAT DEPARTMENT FOR AVERTING THE DISASTROUS CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE NATIVE TRIBES WERE NOW PLACED AND FOURTHLY AND FINALLY THAT THAT DEPARTMENT EXPLAIN
WHEN SHE GOT HER HUSBAND'S LETTER SHE KNEW THEN AT THE BOTTOM OF HER HEART THAT EVERYTHING WOULD GO ON IN THE OLD WAY THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH OF WILL TO FOREGO HER POSITION TO ABANDON HER SON AND TO JOIN HER LOVER
THE BABY WAS BEING FED AND THE RUSSIAN NURSERY MAID WAS EVIDENTLY SHARING HER MEAL NEITHER THE WET NURSE NOR THE HEAD NURSE WERE THERE THEY WERE IN THE NEXT ROOM FROM WHICH CAME THE SOUND OF THEIR CONVERSATION
HE HAD UNCONSCIOUSLY BECOME AGITATED OVER WHAT WAS THE AFFAIR OF HER CONSCIENCE AND WAS STRUGGLING AGAINST THE BARRIER HE FANCIED BETWEEN THEM
THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE IN WHOSE HANDS THE LAW HAD PLACED THE CONTROL OF SO MANY IMPORTANT PUBLIC FUNCTIONS THE GUARDIANSHIP OF WARDS THE VERY DEPARTMENT WHICH WAS GIVING LEVIN SO MUCH TROUBLE JUST NOW
AS ANNA HAD NEVER SEEN HIM SHE STOPPED AND BENDING HER HEAD BACK AND ON ONE SIDE BEGAN WITH HER RAPID HAND TAKING OUT HER HAIRPINS WELL I'M LISTENING TO WHAT'S TO COME SHE SAID CALMLY AND IRONICALLY AND INDEED I LISTEN WITH INTEREST
A LOOK OF HAUGHTINESS AND SEVERITY WHENEVER ANYONE INQUIRED AFTER HIS WIFE'S HEALTH ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH DID NOT WANT TO THINK AT ALL ABOUT HIS WIFE'S BEHAVIOR AND HE ACTUALLY SUCCEEDED IN NOT THINKING ABOUT IT AT ALL
THE DELIGHT HE HAD EXPERIENCED IN THE WORK ITSELF AND THE CONSEQUENT GREATER INTIMACY WITH THE PEASANTS THE ENVY HE FELT OF THEM OF THEIR LIFE THE DESIRE TO ADOPT THAT LIFE WHICH HAD BEEN TO HIM THAT NIGHT NOT A DREAM BUT AN INTENTION
HE THOUGHT NOT OF HIS WIFE BUT OF A COMPLICATION THAT HAD ARISEN IN HIS OFFICIAL LIFE WHICH AT THE TIME CONSTITUTED THE CHIEF INTEREST OF IT HE FELT THAT HE HAD PENETRATED MORE DEEPLY THAN EVER BEFORE INTO THIS INTRICATE AFFAIR
FOR FALLING IN WITH THE TONE OF GAIETY
ON THE FIFTH DAY CAME THE ELECTIONS OF THE DISTRICT MARSHALS
LEFT ALONE DARYA ALEXANDROVNA WITH A GOOD HOUSEWIFE'S EYE SCANNED HER ROOM ALL SHE HAD SEEN IN ENTERING THE HOUSE AND WALKING THROUGH IT AND ALL SHE SAW NOW IN HER ROOM
THE DISPOSAL OF LARGE SUMS SUBSCRIBED BY THE NOBILITY OF THE PROVINCE THE HIGH SCHOOLS FEMALE MALE AND MILITARY AND POPULAR INSTRUCTION ON THE NEW MODEL AND FINALLY THE DISTRICT COUNCIL
OH COME YOU SAY YOURSELF IVAN HAS BEGUN LOOKING AFTER THE CATTLE BETTER ALL I SAY IS ANSWERED AGAFEA MIHALOVNA EVIDENTLY NOT SPEAKING AT RANDOM BUT IN STRICT SEQUENCE OF IDEA THAT YOU OUGHT TO GET MARRIED THAT'S WHAT I SAY
AND DISAPPROVED OF IT AS FAR AS HE COULD DISAPPROVE OF ANYTHING INSTITUTED BY AUTHORITY OF THE EMPEROR HIS WHOLE LIFE HAD BEEN SPENT IN ADMINISTRATIVE WORK AND CONSEQUENTLY WHEN HE DID NOT APPROVE OF ANYTHING
THE NEXT TIME IT WAS JUST THE SAME TIT MOVED ON WITH SWEEP AFTER SWEEP OF HIS SCYTHE NOT STOPPING NOR SHOWING SIGNS OF WEARINESS
THE SECRETARY KNOCKED THE DOOR OPENED AND LEVIN WAS MET BY TWO RED FACED GENTLEMEN WHO DARTED OUT
AS HE WAS AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING PERSON FROM VARIOUS POINTS OF VIEW AND LIKELY TO BE USEFUL
THERE WAS A YOUNG FELLOW VASKA WHO HAD BEEN A COACHMAN OF LEVIN'S TAKING EVERY ROW WITH A WIDE SWEEP HERE TOO WAS TIT LEVIN'S PRECEPTOR IN THE ART OF MOWING A THIN LITTLE PEASANT
THREE DAYS AFTER THE QUARREL PRINCE STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH OBLONSKY
AND ESPECIALLY THAT ALL THIS BUSINESS IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY IT'S NOT OF IMPORTANCE SAID SERGEY IVANOVITCH STUNG TO THE QUICK TOO AT HIS BROTHER'S CONSIDERING ANYTHING OF NO IMPORTANCE THAT INTERESTED HIM
ONLY AT INTERVALS HE LISTENED IN THE STILLNESS TO THE CLICK OF AGAFEA MIHALOVNA'S NEEDLES AND RECOLLECTING WHAT HE DID NOT WANT TO REMEMBER HE FROWNED AGAIN AT NINE O'CLOCK THEY HEARD THE BELL AND THE FAINT VIBRATION OF A CARRIAGE OVER THE MUD
SITTING IN A SIDE SADDLE NAY A MAN SEE HOW SMARTLY HE'S GOING IT
NOW WHILE HE HELD HIS LETTER IN HIS HANDS HE COULD NOT HELP PICTURING THE CHALLENGE WHICH HE WOULD MOST LIKELY FIND AT HOME TODAY OR TOMORROW AND THE DUEL ITSELF IN WHICH WITH THE SAME COLD AND HAUGHTY EXPRESSION THAT HIS FACE WAS ASSUMING AT THIS MOMENT
WITH HER HAIR DONE UP HIGH AND A GOWN MORE FASHIONABLE THAN DOLLY'S WAS AS NEW AND EXPENSIVE AS THE WHOLE ROOM DARYA ALEXANDROVNA LIKED HER NEATNESS HER DEFERENTIAL AND OBLIGING MANNERS BUT SHE FELT ILL AT EASE WITH HER
AND SAW HER AT LAST IN HER BEDROOM WITH THE UNLUCKY LETTER THAT REVEALED EVERYTHING IN HER HAND SHE HIS DOLLY FOREVER FUSSING AND WORRYING OVER HOUSEHOLD DETAILS AND LIMITED IN HER IDEAS AS HE CONSIDERED
NOW I MUST GO TO HIM SHE SAID SHORTLY HER PRESENTIMENT THAT ALL WOULD AGAIN GO ON IN THE OLD WAY HAD NOT DECEIVED HER ON TUESDAY I SHALL BE IN PETERSBURG AND EVERYTHING CAN BE SETTLED YES SHE SAID BUT DON'T LET US TALK ANY MORE OF IT
AND WAS SURPRISED AT HIS VISIT AND STILL MORE SO WHEN THE DOCTOR QUESTIONED HIM VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT HIS HEALTH LISTENED TO HIS BREATHING AND TAPPED AT HIS LIVER ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH DID NOT KNOW THAT HIS FRIEND LIDIA IVANOVNA
HE LOOKED ROUND AS HE SPOKE TO THE DECEPTION IN WHICH WE ARE LIVING
SECONDLY IF IT SHOULD APPEAR THAT THE CONDITION OF THE NATIVE TRIBES ACTUALLY WAS SUCH AS IT APPEARED TO BE FROM THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS IN THE HANDS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT ANOTHER NEW SCIENTIFIC COMMISSION SHOULD BE APPOINTED
THE DRESS WAS SET RIGHT BUT THERE WAS NEARLY A QUARREL WITH THE ENGLISH GOVERNESS ON THE MORNING HOWEVER ALL WAS HAPPILY ARRANGED AND TOWARDS TEN O'CLOCK
STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH WAS ALREADY WASHED AND COMBED AND READY TO BE DRESSED WHEN MATVEY STEPPING DELIBERATELY IN HIS CREAKY BOOTS
SEEING HER HUSBAND SHE DROPPED HER HANDS INTO THE DRAWER OF THE BUREAU AS THOUGH LOOKING FOR SOMETHING AND ONLY LOOKED ROUND AT HIM WHEN HE HAD COME QUITE UP TO HER BUT HER FACE TO WHICH SHE TRIED TO GIVE A SEVERE AND RESOLUTE EXPRESSION
EVEN PRINCESS VARVARA PLAYING PATIENCE CONFIRMED THIS AND ANNA FLUSHING HOTLY GOT UP BUT INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN AS SHE HAD DONE TWICE BEFORE SHE STOOD STILL SHE SUDDENLY FELT ASHAMED OF HER DUPLICITY
ONCE MORE SHAKING LEVIN'S HAND WITH GREAT WARMTH WELL ARE THERE PLENTY OF BIRDS STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SAID TO LEVIN HARDLY LEAVING TIME FOR EVERYONE TO UTTER THEIR GREETINGS WE'VE COME WITH THE MOST SAVAGE INTENTIONS
THE MASTER SURE DOES HIS BEST FOR HIMSELF BUT SEE THE GRASS MISSED OUT FOR SUCH WORK US FELLOWS WOULD CATCH IT THE GRASS BECAME SOFTER AND LEVIN LISTENING WITHOUT ANSWERING FOLLOWED TIT
THE MOTIONLESS GREEN OF THE TREES AND GRASS THE FIELDS WITH EVENLY DRAWN FURROWS OF POTATOES AND THE SLANTING SHADOWS THAT FELL FROM THE HOUSES AND TREES AND BUSHES AND EVEN FROM THE ROWS OF POTATOES
GREETED THE MASTER THEY ALL STARED AT HIM BUT NO ONE MADE ANY REMARK TILL A TALL OLD MAN WITH A WRINKLED BEARDLESS FACE WEARING A SHORT SHEEPSKIN JACKET CAME OUT INTO THE ROAD AND ACCOSTED HIM LOOK'EE NOW MASTER
AND THE MOST AWFUL THING ABOUT IT IS THAT IT'S ALL MY FAULT ALL MY FAULT THOUGH I'M NOT TO BLAME
PURPOSELY CONSTRUCTED FOR CRAWLING AND SWINGS AND BATHS ALL OF SPECIAL PATTERN AND MODERN THEY WERE ALL ENGLISH SOLID AND OF GOOD MAKE AND OBVIOUSLY VERY EXPENSIVE
HERE I'M PERFECTLY AT EASE AND HAPPY WELL OF THAT LATER ON THOUGH
THE GOOD LOOKING YOUNG WOMAN CAME INTO THE OUTER ROOM WITH THE FULL PAILS DRAGGING AT HER SHOULDERS MORE WOMEN CAME ON THE SCENE FROM SOMEWHERE YOUNG AND HANDSOME MIDDLE AGED OLD AND UGLY
SHE DID NOT ANSWER
THE UNFATHOMABLE EYES GAZED IRONICALLY AND INSOLENTLY AT HIM INSUFFERABLY INSOLENT AND CHALLENGING WAS THE EFFECT IN ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S EYES OF THE BLACK LACE ABOUT THE HEAD ADMIRABLY TOUCHED IN BY THE PAINTER
HE SAID KEEPING HOLD ALL THE WHILE OF THE CARRIAGE A HEALTHY LOOKING BROAD SHOULDERED YOUNG FELLOW CAME UP TOO WHAT IS IT LABORERS THEY WANT FOR THE HARVEST HE ASKED I DON'T KNOW MY BOY
HIS FACE WAS DREADFUL LOOKING FROM EXHAUSTION AND DISMAY I TOLD YOU NOT TO LET ANY ONE OUT HE CRIED TO THE DOORKEEPER I LET SOMEONE IN YOUR EXCELLENCY MERCY ON US AND WITH A HEAVY SIGH THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE WALKED WITH DOWNCAST HEAD
AND NOT FOR MY SAKE I SEE THAT YOU SUFFER YES RUN AWAY AND BECOME YOUR MISTRESS SHE SAID ANGRILY
AS BY NOW ALL HIS FINGERS WERE USED UP HE UNCROOKED ALL HIS FINGERS AND WENT ON THIS IS THE THEORETICAL VIEW BUT I IMAGINE YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO APPLY TO ME IN ORDER TO LEARN ITS APPLICATION IN PRACTICE
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE FELT ON THE POINT OF WEEPING HE COULD NOT HAVE SAID EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS TOUCHED HIM SO HE FELT SORRY FOR HER AND HE FELT HE COULD NOT HELP HER AND WITH THAT HE KNEW THAT HE WAS TO BLAME FOR HER WRETCHEDNESS
NOT ONE OF HER OWN CHILDREN HAD CRAWLED LIKE THAT WHEN THE BABY WAS PUT ON THE CARPET AND ITS LITTLE DRESS TUCKED UP BEHIND IT WAS WONDERFULLY CHARMING LOOKING ROUND LIKE SOME LITTLE WILD ANIMAL AT THE GROWN UP BIG PEOPLE
WITH PAIN AND WRATH SHE UTTERED THE WORD SO TERRIBLE TO HERSELF STRANGER HE LOOKED AT HER AND THE FURY EXPRESSED IN HER FACE ALARMED AND AMAZED HIM
WAS ONLY GOOD FOR PROMENADE AND WOULDN'T DO THIRTY MILES STRAIGHT OFF IN THE HEAT THE PEASANTS HAD ALL GOT UP FROM THE CART AND WERE INQUISITIVELY AND MIRTHFULLY STARING AT THE MEETING OF THE FRIENDS MAKING THEIR COMMENTS ON IT
BUT HE WAS SILENT SHE WAITED FOR A LONG WHILE WITHOUT MOVING AND HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM SHE THOUGHT OF THAT OTHER SHE PICTURED HIM AND FELT HOW HER HEART WAS FLOODED WITH EMOTION AND GUILTY DELIGHT AT THE THOUGHT OF HIM SUDDENLY
WITH REPROACHFUL TENDERNESS YES SHE WENT ON BECOME YOUR MISTRESS AND COMPLETE THE RUIN OF AGAIN SHE WOULD HAVE SAID MY SON BUT SHE COULD NOT UTTER THAT WORD
BUT WILL YOU PLEASE GO TO THE FRONT DOOR
MET IN THE ROOMS OF THE HALL OF NOBILITY THERE WAS MUCH DISCUSSION AROUND THE GOVERNOR'S TABLE UNDER THE PORTRAIT OF THE TSAR THE NOBLES BOTH IN THE LARGER AND THE SMALLER ROOMS GROUPED THEMSELVES IN CAMPS
ROUNDLY DECLARING HIS WIFE TO BE ABOVE SUSPICION AND FROM THAT TIME BEGAN TO AVOID COUNTESS LIDIA
GROANING HALF ASLEEP AND FROM HABIT CALLING WITHOUT DISTINCTION ON GOD AND THE DEVIL WAS NOT SO REMOTE AS IT HAD HITHERTO SEEMED TO HIM IT WAS IN HIMSELF TOO HE FELT THAT IF NOT TODAY TOMORROW
AND THAT IRRITATED LEVIN I'LL TELL YOU THEN HE SAID WITH HEAT I IMAGINE THE MAINSPRING OF ALL OUR ACTIONS IS AFTER ALL SELF INTEREST NOW IN THE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS I AS A NOBLEMAN SEE NOTHING THAT COULD CONDUCE TO MY PROSPERITY
SUDDENLY OF AGAFEA MIHALOVNA WHO WAS STANDING WITH A MYSTERIOUS AIR AND A FACE FULL OF MEANING ABOUT SUPPER WELL THAT'S RIGHT SAID DOLLY
HE DID NOT REALIZE IT BECAUSE IT WAS TOO TERRIBLE TO HIM TO REALIZE HIS ACTUAL POSITION
OBVIOUSLY PLEASED WITH HIS OWN APPEARANCE DARYA ALEXANDROVNA COULD NOT SUPPRESS A GOOD HUMORED SMILE AS SHE RECOGNIZED HIM
MIGHT AWAIT HIS CUSTOMER'S CHOICE BUT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SAID NOTHING AND THEREFORE THE LAWYER WENT ON THE MOST USUAL AND SIMPLE THE SENSIBLE COURSE I CONSIDER IS ADULTERY BY MUTUAL CONSENT
AND WAS MAKING UP HIS MIND TO ASK TIT TO STOP BUT AT THAT VERY MOMENT TIT STOPPED OF HIS OWN ACCORD AND STOOPING DOWN PICKED UP SOME GRASS RUBBED HIS SCYTHE AND BEGAN WHETTING IT LEVIN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF AND DRAWING A DEEP BREATH LOOKED ROUND
AND CONSCIOUS OF THEIR LOVE THAT EVENING AND THEIR HAPPINESS IN THEIR LOVE SEEMED TO IMPLY A DISAGREEABLE SLUR ON THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE LIKED TO FEEL THE SAME AND COULD NOT AND THEY FELT A PRICK OF CONSCIENCE
TONIGHT AT ONE O'CLOCK SHE WHISPERED AND WITH A HEAVY SIGH SHE WALKED WITH HER LIGHT SWIFT STEP TO MEET HER SON SERYOZHA HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY THE RAIN IN THE BIG GARDEN AND HE
THE CONCEPTION OF RIDING ON HORSEBACK FOR A LADY WAS IN DARYA ALEXANDROVNA'S MIND ASSOCIATED WITH IDEAS OF YOUTHFUL FLIRTATION AND FRIVOLITY WHICH IN HER OPINION WAS UNBECOMING IN ANNA'S POSITION
LOOK AT A REAPING MACHINE THEY'LL BE HOME BY NOW AND WHO WILL YOU BE BELONGING TO WE'VE COME A LONG WAY SAID THE COACHMAN CLIMBING ONTO THE BOX SO IT'S NOT FAR I TELL YOU IT'S JUST HERE AS SOON AS YOU GET OUT
FOR ME TO LAY BEFORE YOU ALL THE METHODS BY WHICH YOU COULD SECURE WHAT YOU DESIRE AND ON RECEIVING AN ASSURING NOD FROM ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH HE WENT ON STEALING A GLANCE NOW AND THEN AT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S FACE WHICH WAS GROWING RED IN PATCHES
I CAN'T SEE WHERE PHILOSOPHY COMES IN SAID SERGEY IVANOVITCH IN A TONE LEVIN FANCIED
THEY WERE UNMISTAKABLY TIGHT AND SHORT IN THE WAIST AS THOUGH THEIR WEARERS HAD GROWN OUT OF THEM THE YOUNGER MEN WORE THE UNIFORM OF THE NOBILITY WITH LONG WAISTS AND BROAD SHOULDERS UNBUTTONED OVER WHITE WAISTCOATS
I'M HAPPY VERY HAPPY HE SAID TO HIMSELF HE HAD OFTEN BEFORE HAD THIS SENSE OF PHYSICAL JOY IN HIS OWN BODY BUT HE HAD NEVER FELT SO FOND OF HIMSELF OF HIS OWN BODY AS AT THAT MOMENT HE ENJOYED THE SLIGHT ACHE IN HIS STRONG LEG
AT WHAT SHE HAD DONE THAT SHE COULD NOT FACE IT BUT LIKE A WOMAN COULD ONLY TRY TO COMFORT HERSELF WITH LYING ASSURANCES THAT EVERYTHING WOULD REMAIN AS IT ALWAYS HAD BEEN AND THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO FORGET THE FEARFUL QUESTION
YOU KNOW MY NAME ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH RESUMED I KNOW YOU AND THE GOOD AGAIN HE CAUGHT A MOTH WORK YOU ARE DOING LIKE EVERY RUSSIAN SAID THE LAWYER BOWING ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SIGHED
LEVIN WAS ON THE STAIRS TO THE WAY OUT AND WAS JUST FEELING IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET FOR THE NUMBER OF HIS OVERCOAT WHEN THE SECRETARY OVERTOOK HIM THIS WAY PLEASE KONSTANTIN DMITRIEVITCH THEY ARE VOTING
CHAPTER THIRTY TWO BEFORE VRONSKY'S DEPARTURE FOR THE ELECTIONS ANNA HAD REFLECTED THAT THE SCENES CONSTANTLY REPEATED BETWEEN THEM EACH TIME HE LEFT HOME MIGHT ONLY MAKE HIM COLD TO HER INSTEAD OF ATTACHING HIM TO HER
ANNA HAD ARRIVED IN PETERSBURG EARLY IN THE MORNING THE CARRIAGE HAD BEEN SENT TO MEET HER IN ACCORDANCE WITH HER TELEGRAM
KONSTANTIN LEVIN HAD WARMED TO HIS SUBJECT AND BEGAN MIMICKING THE PRESIDENT AND THE HALF WITTED ALIOSHKA IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT WAS ALL TO THE POINT
OH THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE SAID THE LAWYER AND THAT'S ALWAYS FOR YOU TO DECIDE HE LET HIS EYES REST ON ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH'S FEET FEELING THAT HE MIGHT OFFEND HIS CLIENT BY THE SIGHT OF HIS IRREPRESSIBLE AMUSEMENT
WAS THE WORD SON WHICH SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO PRONOUNCE WHEN SHE THOUGHT OF HER SON AND HIS FUTURE ATTITUDE TO HIS MOTHER WHO HAD ABANDONED HIS FATHER SHE FELT SUCH TERROR
THE MOMENT CAME WHEN HE FELT HE HAD NO STRENGTH LEFT BUT AT THAT VERY MOMENT TIT STOPPED AND WHETTED THE SCYTHES SO THEY MOWED THE FIRST ROW
AND THE FEMALE HIGH SCHOOL OF NO IMPORTANCE WHATEVER AS SERGEY IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED AND LEVIN BUSY SEEING AFTER HIS OWN AFFAIRS DID NOT ATTEND THE MEETINGS
NEITHER YOU NOR I HAVE LOOKED ON OUR RELATIONS AS A PASSING AMUSEMENT
SHE COULD NOT GET OUT OF THE HABIT OF REGARDING HIM AS HER HUSBAND AND LOVING HIM BESIDES THIS SHE REALIZED THAT IF EVEN HERE IN HER OWN HOUSE SHE COULD HARDLY MANAGE TO LOOK AFTER HER FIVE CHILDREN PROPERLY THEY WOULD BE STILL WORSE OFF WHERE SHE WAS GOING WITH THEM ALL
DOCTORS AND DISPENSARIES ARE NO USE TO ME AN ARBITRATOR OF DISPUTES IS NO USE TO ME I NEVER APPEAL TO HIM AND NEVER SHALL APPEAL TO HIM THE SCHOOLS ARE NO GOOD TO ME BUT POSITIVELY HARMFUL AS I TOLD YOU
WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED NEGATIVE AGAIN HALF ASLEEP HE HEARD THE LAUGHTER AND MIRTHFUL TALK OF VESLOVSKY AND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH FOR AN INSTANT HE OPENED HIS EYES THE MOON WAS UP AND IN THE OPEN DOORWAY
IN APPEARANCE THE NOBLEMEN WERE SHARPLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE OLD AND THE NEW THE OLD WERE FOR THE MOST PART EITHER IN OLD UNIFORMS OF THE NOBILITY
AND HOW SPLENDID THE DISCUSSIONS HAD BEEN IN ONE GROUP LEVIN HEARD HIS BROTHER'S PRAISES ONE LADY WAS TELLING A LAWYER
I SOMETIMES FEEL SORRY I'M SO SUPERFLUOUS HERE SAID ANNA GOING OUT OF THE NURSERY AND HOLDING UP HER SKIRT SO AS TO ESCAPE THE PLAYTHING STANDING IN THE DOORWAY IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT WITH MY FIRST CHILD
ON HIS WAY BACK HE CAUGHT UNOBSERVED ANOTHER MOTH NICE STATE MY REP CURTAINS WILL BE IN BY THE SUMMER HE THOUGHT FROWNING AND SO YOU WERE SAYING HE SAID
I'LL TRY NOT TO LET IT GO HE SAID TAKING HIS STAND BEHIND TIT AND WAITING FOR THE TIME TO BEGIN
PRINCESS VARVARA YOU KNOW HER AND I KNOW YOUR OPINION AND STIVA'S ABOUT HER
THAT SHE HAD COME WENT TO HER OWN ROOM AND OCCUPIED HERSELF IN SORTING OUT HER THINGS EXPECTING HE WOULD COME TO HER BUT AN HOUR PASSED HE DID NOT COME
BUT THIS TIME SHE FOUND A BIG ONE QUITE OF HERSELF AND THERE WAS A GENERAL SCREAM OF DELIGHT LILY HAS FOUND A MUSHROOM THEN THEY REACHED THE RIVER PUT THE HORSES UNDER THE BIRCH TREES AND WENT TO THE BATHING PLACE
BUNDLING TOGETHER THE HARNESS HE HAD TAKEN OFF AND FLINGING IT ON THE GROUND YOU CAN PUT THEM ON
LEVIN TRIED TO UNDERSTAND HIM AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HIM AND LOOKED AT HIM AND HIS LIFE AS AT A LIVING ENIGMA LEVIN AND HE WERE VERY FRIENDLY AND SO LEVIN USED TO VENTURE TO SOUND SVIAZHSKY TO TRY TO GET AT THE VERY FOUNDATION OF HIS VIEW OF LIFE
AND A PROUD AND HARD EXPRESSION CAME OVER HIS FACE YES YES THAT'S BETTER A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER I KNOW HOW PAINFUL IT WAS HE SAID BUT SHE WAS NOT LISTENING TO HIS WORDS SHE WAS READING HIS THOUGHTS FROM THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE
AND GETTING UP HE PUT ON A GRAY DRESSING GOWN LINED WITH BLUE SILK TIED THE TASSELS IN A KNOT AND DRAWING A DEEP BREATH OF AIR INTO HIS BROAD BARE CHEST HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW WITH HIS USUAL CONFIDENT STEP
BUT A REVOLUTION OF THE GREATEST MAGNITUDE BEGINNING IN THE LITTLE CIRCLE OF OUR DISTRICT THEN THE PROVINCE THEN RUSSIA THE WHOLE WORLD BECAUSE A JUST IDEA CANNOT BUT BE FRUITFUL YES IT'S AN AIM WORTH WORKING FOR
AND MORE IN THE SAME STYLE SHE ADDED IN GENERAL TERMS HE'LL SAY IN HIS OFFICIAL MANNER AND WITH ALL DISTINCTNESS AND PRECISION THAT HE CANNOT LET ME GO
WAS NOT SO MUCH ANNOYED AT THE FACT ITSELF AS AT THE WAY IN WHICH HE HAD MET HIS WIFE'S WORDS THERE HAPPENED TO HIM AT THAT INSTANT WHAT DOES HAPPEN TO PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE UNEXPECTEDLY CAUGHT IN SOMETHING VERY DISGRACEFUL
RANG AND SENT A NOTE TO THE CHIEF SECRETARY OF HIS DEPARTMENT TO LOOK UP CERTAIN NECESSARY FACTS FOR HIM GETTING UP AND WALKING ABOUT THE ROOM HE GLANCED AGAIN AT THE PORTRAIT FROWNED AND SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY
OH NOT OVER MY HUSBAND SHE SAID WITH A QUIET SMILE I DON'T KNOW HIM I DON'T THINK OF HIM HE DOESN'T EXIST YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING SINCERELY I KNOW YOU YOU WORRY ABOUT HIM TOO
BUT UTTERLY WITHOUT ANY COMPREHENSION OF THE NEEDS OF MODERN DAYS HE ALWAYS TOOK IN EVERY QUESTION THE SIDE OF THE NOBILITY HE WAS POSITIVELY ANTAGONISTIC TO THE SPREAD OF POPULAR EDUCATION AND HE SUCCEEDED
GIVE IT TO THIS PEASANT HE WOULD NOT REFUSE IT YES BUT HOW AM I TO GIVE IT UP AM I TO GO TO HIM AND MAKE A DEED OF CONVEYANCE
A WORN OUT WOMAN NO LONGER YOUNG OR GOOD LOOKING AND IN NO WAY REMARKABLE OR INTERESTING MERELY A GOOD MOTHER OUGHT FROM A SENSE OF FAIRNESS TO TAKE AN INDULGENT VIEW IT HAD TURNED OUT QUITE THE OTHER WAY OH IT'S AWFUL
AFTER LONG NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE LEGAL DETAILS THE MONEY WAS AT LAST READY TO BE PAID BUT THE NOTARY A MOST OBLIGING PERSON COULD NOT HAND OVER THE ORDER BECAUSE IT MUST HAVE THE SIGNATURE OF THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRESIDENT
IT WAS SO NARROW ON TANYA'S SHOULDERS THAT IT WAS QUITE PAINFUL TO LOOK AT HER BUT MARYA PHILIMONOVNA HAD THE HAPPY THOUGHT OF PUTTING IN GUSSETS AND ADDING A LITTLE SHOULDER CAPE
VULGAR IN FLIRTING WITH ONE'S GOVERNESS BUT WHAT A GOVERNESS
BUT DOLLY FORGIVE ME SHE SAT DOWN HE LISTENED TO HER HARD HEAVY BREATHING
SO THAT EVEN THEIR AWE OF FYODOR BOGDANITCH COULD NOT CHECK THE EFFERVESCING OVERBRIMMING SENSE OF LIFE AND HAPPINESS AND NOW THAT BENT HOLLOW CHEST
BEGAN TO SAY THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY BE AGREEABLE TO THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPENDITURES OF THE PUBLIC MONEYS AND THAT THE MISPLACED DELICACY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WAS DEPRIVING HIM OF THIS MORAL SATISFACTION
WHEN LEVIN AND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH REACHED THE PEASANT'S HUT WHERE LEVIN ALWAYS USED TO STAY VESLOVSKY WAS ALREADY THERE HE WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HUT CLINGING WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE BENCH FROM WHICH HE WAS BEING PULLED BY A SOLDIER
THOUGH HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE WORK THAN I DO THAT'S DISHONEST I SUPPOSE I CAN'T SAY WELL BUT I CAN TELL YOU YOUR RECEIVING SOME FIVE THOUSAND LET'S SAY FOR YOUR WORK ON THE LAND
DID IT OFTEN HAPPEN DARYA ALEXANDROVNA FELT DISINCLINED TO LEAVE THE PEASANT WOMEN SO INTERESTING TO HER WAS THEIR CONVERSATION SO COMPLETELY IDENTICAL WERE ALL THEIR INTERESTS
AND STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH COULD NOT GET THROUGH EVEN A SHORT SERVICE WITHOUT HIS LEGS ACHING FROM STANDING UP AND COULD NEVER MAKE OUT WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF ALL THE TERRIBLE AND HIGH FLOWN LANGUAGE ABOUT ANOTHER WORLD WHEN LIFE MIGHT BE SO VERY AMUSING IN THIS WORLD AND WITH ALL THIS
THEY HAD MADE NO AGREEMENT ABOUT THIS IT HAD SETTLED ITSELF THEY WOULD HAVE FELT
THEY WERE VRONSKY WITH A JOCKEY VESLOVSKY AND ANNA ON HORSEBACK AND PRINCESS VARVARA AND SVIAZHSKY
SINCE HIS MARRIAGE THERE HAD BEEN REVEALED TO LEVIN SO MANY NEW AND SERIOUS ASPECTS OF LIFE
THE FARMING OF THE LAND AS HE WAS MANAGING IT HAD BECOME NOT MERELY UNATTRACTIVE BUT REVOLTING TO HIM
LEVIN LEAPED OUT AND HELPED GRISHA OUT AFTER HIM
HE'S STRAINED TO THE UTMOST AND THERE'S SOME OUTSIDE BURDEN WEIGHING ON HIM AND NOT A LIGHT ONE CONCLUDED THE DOCTOR RAISING HIS EYEBROWS SIGNIFICANTLY
THEY WERE MOWING SLOWLY OVER THE UNEVEN LOW LYING PARTS OF THE MEADOW WHERE THERE HAD BEEN AN OLD DAM LEVIN RECOGNIZED SOME OF HIS OWN MEN HERE WAS OLD YERMIL IN A VERY LONG WHITE SMOCK BENDING FORWARD TO SWING A SCYTHE
AH SAID DARYA ALEXANDROVNA AND UNCONSCIOUSLY HER FACE BETRAYED HER DISSATISFACTION PRINCESS VARVARA WAS HER HUSBAND'S AUNT AND SHE HAD LONG KNOWN HER AND DID NOT RESPECT HER
AS SHE WAS IN REALITY HE WAS JUST GOING IN STEPPING ON HIS WHOLE FOOT SO AS NOT TO CREAK UP THE WORN STEPS OF THE TERRACE WHEN HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED WHAT HE ALWAYS FORGOT
RECALLING ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH AS SHE SPOKE WITH ALL THE PECULIARITIES OF HIS FIGURE AND MANNER OF SPEAKING AND RECKONING AGAINST HIM EVERY DEFECT SHE COULD FIND IN HIM
IT'S NOT SET RIGHT HANDLE'S TOO HIGH SEE HOW HE HAS TO STOOP TO IT SAID ONE PRESS MORE ON THE HEEL SAID ANOTHER NEVER MIND HE'LL GET ON ALL RIGHT THE OLD MAN RESUMED HE'S MADE A START YOU SWING IT TOO WIDE YOU'LL TIRE YOURSELF OUT
AND SO I SIMPLY INFORM YOU THAT OUR RELATIONS
MANY WERE IN ECSTASIES MANY WERE DISGUSTED AND UNHAPPY THE FORMER MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE WAS IN A STATE OF DESPAIR WHICH HE COULD NOT CONCEAL WHEN NEVYEDOVSKY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM THE CROWD THRONGED ROUND HIM
AND HE LIKED HIS NEWSPAPER AS HE DID HIS CIGAR AFTER DINNER FOR THE SLIGHT FOG IT DIFFUSED IN HIS BRAIN HE READ THE LEADING ARTICLE IN WHICH IT WAS MAINTAINED THAT IT WAS QUITE SENSELESS IN OUR DAY TO RAISE AN OUTCRY THAT RADICALISM WAS THREATENING TO SWALLOW UP ALL CONSERVATIVE ELEMENTS
LEVIN UNDERSTOOD TO SOME EXTENT BUT NOT FULLY AND WOULD HAVE PUT A FEW MORE QUESTIONS WHEN SUDDENLY EVERYONE BEGAN TALKING AND MAKING A NOISE AND THEY MOVED TOWARDS THE BIG ROOM WHAT IS IT EH WHOM
THE CRESCENT SHAPED CURVE OF THE CUT GRASS THE GRASS AND FLOWER HEADS SLOWLY AND RHYTHMICALLY FALLING BEFORE THE BLADE OF HIS SCYTHE AND AHEAD OF HIM THE END OF THE ROW WHERE WOULD COME THE REST SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF HIS TOIL WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT WAS OR WHENCE IT CAME
HE ADDED TURNING TO LEVIN AND DRAWING HIS ARM THROUGH HIS LEVIN WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD INDEED TO BE CONVERTED BUT COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT THE POINT WAS
AFTER EATING A CUTLET WITH BEANS AND TALKING TO THE WAITERS OF THEIR FORMER MASTERS LEVIN NOT WISHING TO GO BACK TO THE HALL
FATHER FINOGEN WANTS SOME TAR SAID THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE CLOGS COMING IN YES YES THAT'S HOW IT IS SIR SAID THE OLD MAN GETTING UP AND CROSSING HIMSELF DELIBERATELY HE THANKED LEVIN AND WENT OUT
NO GUARANTEE WHOSE WHAT THEY WON'T PASS HIM NO GUARANTEE THEY WON'T LET FLEROV IN EH BECAUSE OF THE CHARGE AGAINST HIM WHY AT THIS RATE THEY WON'T ADMIT ANYONE IT'S A SWINDLE THE LAW
AND ITS BEING ME KOSTYA LEVIN WHO WENT TO A BALL IN A BLACK TIE AND WAS REFUSED BY THE SHTCHERBATSKAYA GIRL AND WHO WAS INTRINSICALLY SUCH A PITIFUL WORTHLESS CREATURE THAT PROVES NOTHING I FEEL SURE FRANKLIN FELT JUST AS WORTHLESS
YES HE'S VERY HEEDLESS SAID THE PRINCESS ADDRESSING SERGEY IVANOVITCH I'VE BEEN MEANING INDEED TO ASK YOU TO TELL HIM THAT IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR HER SHE INDICATED KITTY TO STAY HERE
HE VIGOROUSLY EMBRACED THE PILLOW ON THE OTHER SIDE AND BURIED HIS FACE IN IT BUT ALL AT ONCE HE JUMPED UP
THE COUNTING HOUSE CLERK TO CONCEAL HIS CONFUSION BUSIED HIMSELF SETTLING THE LADIES BUT PHILIP THE COACHMAN BECAME SULLEN AND WAS BRACING HIMSELF NOT TO BE OVERAWED IN FUTURE BY THIS EXTERNAL SUPERIORITY
AT OUR LAST CONVERSATION I NOTIFIED YOU OF MY INTENTION TO COMMUNICATE TO YOU MY DECISION IN REGARD TO THE SUBJECT OF THAT CONVERSATION HAVING CAREFULLY CONSIDERED EVERYTHING
WHICH NO ONE INQUIRED INTO FOR WELL KNOWN REASONS OF OFFICIAL ETIQUETTE HOWEVER NOW THAT THE GLOVE HAD BEEN THROWN DOWN TO HIM HE HAD BOLDLY PICKED IT UP AND DEMANDED THE APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE
SHE SPOKE THE TRUTH IF EVER AT ANY MOMENT SHE HAD BEEN ASKED WHAT SHE WAS THINKING OF SHE COULD HAVE ANSWERED TRULY OF THE SAME THING
EVIDENTLY NOT DISPOSED TO PURSUE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT VARENKA IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND TWO SONS IN LAW MORE UNLIKE THAN YOURS HE SAID WITH A SUBTLE SMILE ONE ALL MOVEMENT ONLY LIVING IN SOCIETY LIKE A FISH IN WATER
THE SENSATION PRODUCED BY HER CHILDREN AND HER THE CHILDREN WERE NOT ONLY BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK AT IN THEIR SMART LITTLE DRESSES BUT THEY WERE CHARMING IN THE WAY THEY BEHAVED ALIOSHA IT IS TRUE DID NOT STAND QUITE CORRECTLY
WHO SHOUTED IN A LOUD HIGH VOICE
SO WHAT IS SHE SO PLEASED ABOUT REVOLTING THOUGHT LEVIN HE LOOKED AT THE PRINCESS WHO HAD BEEN SO DEAR TO HIM A MINUTE BEFORE AND HE DID NOT LIKE THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE WELCOMED THIS VASSENKA WITH HIS RIBBONS
WELL I'LL SPEND A MONTH OR TWO WITH YOU AND THEN I'M OFF TO MOSCOW DO YOU KNOW MYAKOV HAS PROMISED ME A PLACE THERE AND I'M GOING INTO THE SERVICE NOW I'M GOING TO ARRANGE MY LIFE QUITE DIFFERENTLY HE WENT ON YOU KNOW I GOT RID OF THAT WOMAN MARYA NIKOLAEVNA
TO SORT OUT THE CHILDREN'S THINGS AND HER OWN SO AS TO TAKE THEM TO HER MOTHER'S AND AGAIN SHE COULD NOT BRING HERSELF TO DO THIS BUT NOW AGAIN AS EACH TIME BEFORE SHE KEPT SAYING TO HERSELF THAT THINGS CANNOT GO ON LIKE THIS
AGAFEA MIHALOVNA'S ALLUSION TO THE VERY SUBJECT HE HAD ONLY JUST BEEN THINKING ABOUT HURT AND STUNG HIM LEVIN SCOWLED AND WITHOUT ANSWERING HER HE SAT DOWN AGAIN TO HIS WORK REPEATING TO HIMSELF ALL THAT HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT WORK
NEVER WITH ANY OUTSIDE PERSON NEVER ON ANY OFFICIAL VISIT HAD HE BEEN SO UNNATURAL AND FALSE AS HE WAS THAT EVENING AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THIS UNNATURALNESS AND THE REMORSE HE FELT AT IT MADE HIM EVEN MORE UNNATURAL
I EXPECTED IT TO BE THE OTHER WAY SAID DARYA ALEXANDROVNA SHYLY OH NO BY THE WAY DO YOU KNOW I SAW
SHE KNEW THAT PRINCESS VARVARA HAD PASSED HER WHOLE LIFE TOADYING ON HER RICH RELATIONS BUT THAT SHE SHOULD NOW BE SPONGING ON VRONSKY A MAN WHO WAS NOTHING TO HER MORTIFIED DOLLY ON ACCOUNT OF HER KINSHIP WITH HER HUSBAND
AND HE COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO BE DONE
AND THAT HE HAD ORIGINATED A LEADING IDEA HE COULD SAY IT WITHOUT SELF FLATTERY CALCULATED TO CLEAR UP THE WHOLE BUSINESS TO STRENGTHEN HIM IN HIS OFFICIAL CAREER TO DISCOMFIT HIS ENEMIES
BEFORE CROSSING THE BRIDGE AND WALKED TO THE HOUSE HE DID NOT GO UP THE STEPS TO THE STREET DOOR BUT WENT INTO THE COURT HAS YOUR MASTER COME HE ASKED A GARDENER NO SIR THE MISTRESS IS AT HOME
THAT NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW THE SOLICITOR CERTAINLY DID NOT KNOW
WHICH LOOKED PROMINENT FROM THE THINNESS OF HER FACE WAS STANDING AMONG A LITTER OF ALL SORTS OF THINGS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE ROOM BEFORE AN OPEN BUREAU FROM WHICH SHE WAS TAKING SOMETHING HEARING HER HUSBAND'S STEPS SHE STOPPED LOOKING TOWARDS THE DOOR
AND THEREFORE GUIDED BY PRECEDENTS I MUST INFORM YOU THAT IN PRACTICE CASES OF DIVORCE MAY ALL BE REDUCED TO THE FOLLOWING THERE'S NO PHYSICAL DEFECT I MAY ASSUME NOR DESERTION
PUT IT IN THE RIGHT SIDE WHISPERED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH AS WITH HIS BROTHER LEVIN FOLLOWED THE MARSHAL OF HIS DISTRICT TO THE TABLE BUT LEVIN HAD FORGOTTEN BY NOW THE CALCULATIONS THAT HAD BEEN EXPLAINED TO HIM
SPECIALLY PUT ON AS HE FANCIED FOR HIS BENEFIT CUT PARTICULARLY OPEN IN THE SHAPE OF A TRAPEZE ON HER WHITE BOSOM THIS QUADRANGULAR OPENING IN SPITE OF THE BOSOM'S BEING VERY WHITE OR JUST BECAUSE IT WAS VERY WHITE
ON WHICH SIX CANDLES HAD ALREADY BEEN LIGHTED BY THE VALET WHO HAD PRECEDED HIM HE CRACKED HIS KNUCKLES AND SAT DOWN SORTING OUT HIS WRITING APPURTENANCES PUTTING HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE HE BENT HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE
HE SAID TO HIMSELF THE THOUGHT OF THIS MADE HIM COLD AND HOSTILE TO HER I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO HER WITHOUT A FEELING OF REPROACH I COULD NOT LOOK AT HER WITHOUT RESENTMENT AND SHE WILL ONLY HATE ME ALL THE MORE
WERE GATHERED TOGETHER IN MUCH EXCITEMENT LEVIN SAW VASSENKA VESLOVSKY WITH A PARTICULARLY WARM AND GALLANT AIR KISSING KITTY'S HAND YOUR WIFE AND I ARE COUSINS AND VERY OLD FRIENDS SAID VASSENKA VESLOVSKY
OR ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE ENJOYING UNJUST PRIVILEGES AS I DO AND THEN ENJOY THEM AND BE SATISFIED NO IF IT WERE UNJUST YOU COULD NOT ENJOY THESE ADVANTAGES AND BE SATISFIED AT LEAST I COULD NOT
AND THEN MADE ANOTHER STEP FORWARD WITH HER LITTLE ARMS BUT THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE OF THE NURSERY AND ESPECIALLY THE ENGLISH NURSE DARYA ALEXANDROVNA DID NOT LIKE AT ALL
I PROMISE EVERYTHING
AT TEA THE SAME EVENING LEVIN SAID TO HIS BROTHER I FANCY THE FINE WEATHER WILL LAST TOMORROW I SHALL START MOWING I'M SO FOND OF THAT FORM OF FIELD LABOR SAID SERGEY IVANOVITCH I'M AWFULLY FOND OF IT
QUICKENING HIS STEPS AND TOOK HOLD OF THE MUD GUARD WITH HIS SUNBURNT HAND VOZDVIZHENSKOE THE MANOR HOUSE THE COUNT'S HE REPEATED
MALTHUS WAS A WELL KNOWN CAPITALIST WHO HAD MADE HIS MONEY BY SPECULATION IN RAILWAY SHARES STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH DESCRIBED WHAT GROUSE MOORS THIS MALTHUS HAD BOUGHT IN THE TVER PROVINCE
SHE COULD NOT HELP FEELING ASHAMED OF THE DIRTY OLD CARRIAGE IN WHICH ANNA WAS SITTING WITH HER THE COACHMAN PHILIP AND THE COUNTING HOUSE CLERK WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME SENSATION
HE BEGAN CHATTING LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE RAILING OF THE STEPS
WITHDREW BEHIND THE SCREEN AND PUT OUT THE CANDLE BUT FOR A LONG WHILE HE COULD NOT SLEEP THE QUESTION HOW TO LIVE HAD HARDLY BEGUN TO GROW A LITTLE CLEARER TO HIM WHEN A NEW INSOLUBLE QUESTION PRESENTED ITSELF DEATH WHY HE'S DYING
DARYA ALEXANDROVNA'S EYES WERE FAIRLY DAZZLED BY THE ELEGANT CARRIAGE OF A PATTERN SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE THE SPLENDID HORSES AND THE ELEGANT AND GORGEOUS PEOPLE SURROUNDING HER BUT WHAT STRUCK HER MOST OF ALL
UNHAPPY NO THIS IS MY UNHAPPINESS SHE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF HER SON'S VOICE COMING TOWARDS THEM AND GLANCING SWIFTLY ROUND THE TERRACE SHE GOT UP IMPULSIVELY
HOW WELL WE GOT ON SHE WAS CONTENTED AND HAPPY IN HER CHILDREN I NEVER INTERFERED WITH HER IN ANYTHING I LET HER MANAGE THE CHILDREN AND THE HOUSE JUST AS SHE LIKED IT'S TRUE IT'S BAD HER HAVING BEEN A GOVERNESS IN OUR HOUSE THAT'S BAD THERE'S SOMETHING COMMON
IT'S LATE ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SHE SAID WHEN SHE HAD GONE THROUGH THE DOORWAY ANNA IT'S NECESSARY FOR ME TO HAVE A TALK WITH YOU WITH ME SHE SAID WONDERINGLY SHE CAME OUT FROM BEHIND THE DOOR OF THE DRESSING ROOM AND LOOKED AT HIM
MERELY A TAG UPON THE PLANT BEARING A BARBAROUS FOREIGN OR BOTANICAL NAME HE WAITED UNTIL NIGHT BUT HER ANSWER DID NOT COME HIS LARGE PRIDE AND HURT VANITY KEPT HIM FROM SEEKING HER
BUT I HAVE NOT YET LOST FAITH IN HUMANITY IF I HAVE BEEN DECEIVED AGAIN STILL WE MAY GLEAN HEALTH AND CONTENT IF NOT WORLDLY PROFIT I AM AWARE THAT THERE ARE DISHONEST SCHEMERS IN THE WORLD WHO SET TRAPS FOR THE UNWARY
AND IS OF AN EXTREMELY GENEROUS AND PHILANTHROPIC DISPOSITION WHEN THUS FAR IS REACHED THE MIND HESITATES NO LONGER I CONVEYED YOU AT ONCE TO THE SPOT WHERE SHAMROCK JOLNES WAS PIPING OFF ANDREW CARNEGIE'S RESIDENCE
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU DO NOT KNOW NOW CARRUTHERS WAS AN IDIOT NO DOUBT HE TRYSDALE HAD BEEN GUILTY HE SOMETIMES DID SUCH THINGS
MISTER BLOOM CONDUCTED THEM TO A TWO STORY BUILDING ON A SHADY STREET THAT BORE THE LEGEND PINE TOP INN HERE HE TOOK HIS LEAVE RECEIVING THE CORDIAL THANKS OF THE TWO FOR HIS ATTENTIONS
AFTER CAREFULLY STUDYING THE FIELD OF OPPORTUNITIES OPEN TO CAPITAL HE HAD SOLD HIS LITTLE PROPERTY THERE FOR EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS AND INVESTED IT IN ONE OF THE ENTERPRISES OPENED UP BY THE BOOK IN OKOCHEE
I AM OF A COLD AND HEARTLESS DISPOSITION I DO NOT CARE FOR MY FELLOWMEN AND I NEVER GIVE A CENT TO BEGGARS OR CHARITY NOW MY DEAR DOCTOR THAT IS THE TRUE DESCRIPTION OF MYSELF
IN YACHTING CAPS AND FLOWING NECKTIES THEY PERVADED THE LAKE TO ITS LIMITS GIRLS WORE SILK WAISTS EMBROIDERED WITH ANCHORS IN BLUE AND PINK
WELL DOCTOR SAID KNIGHT UNABLE TO REPRESS A NOTE OF TRIUMPH IN HIS VOICE HAVE YOU SEEN IT IS WONDERFUL WONDERFUL
COLONEL BLAYLOCK ROSE AND MADE A BOW

HOW DO YOU A MERE MURDERER EXPECT TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THE DETECTIVE THAT IS LOOKING FOR YOU AVERY KNIGHT SAT LOST IN THOUGHT FOR A WHILE AT LENGTH HE LOOKED UP BRIGHTLY DOC SAID HE I HAVE IT
THE COLONEL DREW FROM THE TAIL POCKET OF HIS COAT A SMALL SHAWL OF KNITTED SILK AND LAID IT SOLICITOUSLY ABOUT THE SHOULDERS OF THE LADY
HE'S GOT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS LEFT TO BUILD A HOUSE AND STORE WITH WENT ON J PINKNEY AS IF HE WERE TALKING TO HIMSELF AND HE THINKS THERE'S AN OPEN HOUSE UP THERE
GUIDED BY THE INDEFATIGABLE PROMOTER THEY SLOWLY CLIMBED THE STEEP HILLSIDE PAUSING OFTEN TO REST AND ADMIRE THE VIEW FINALLY THEY ENTERED THE VILLAGE OF COLD BRANCH WARMLY BOTH THE COLONEL AND HIS WIFE PRAISED IT FOR ITS HOMELIKE AND PEACEFUL BEAUTY
THE MOST NOTABLE THING ABOUT TIME IS THAT IT IS SO PURELY RELATIVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF REMINISCENCE IS BY COMMON CONSENT CONCEDED TO THE DROWNING MAN
HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF THAT HER PALENESS WAS FROM THOUGHTS OF ANOTHER THAN THE MAN TO WHOM SHE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE HERSELF BUT EVEN THAT POOR CONSOLATION HAD BEEN WRENCHED FROM HIM
SAID THE COLONEL INTERPRETING HER MOOD TO J PINKNEY BLOOM WERE SPENT AMONG THE MOUNTAINS OF NORTHERN GEORGIA MOUNTAIN AIR AND MOUNTAIN SCENERY RECALL TO HER THOSE DAYS
HE QUICKENED HIS GAIT INTO A LANGUID TROT ROUNDING A GREAT CLUMP OF BLACK CHAPARRAL HE STOPPED SHORT SAM DROPPED THE BRIDLE REINS AND SAT
HE SHOULD HAVE STARTED THREE HOURS EARLIER CHAPMAN RANCH WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN MILES AWAY BUT THERE WAS A ROAD FOR ONLY THREE MILES OF THE DISTANCE HE HAD RIDDEN OVER THERE ONCE WITH ONE OF THE HALF MOON COWPUNCHERS AND HE HAD THE DIRECTION WELL DEFINED IN HIS MIND
IF THEY HONOR ME BY GIVING THE CASE TO SOME ONE OF THEIR CELEBRATED SLEUTHS I DO NOT FEAR TO MATCH MY CUNNING AND POWERS OF INDUCTION AGAINST HIS ON THE NEXT AFTERNOON KNIGHT ENTERED MY OFFICE WITH A SATISFIED LOOK ON HIS KEEN COUNTENANCE
THEY SEEMED TO SPEAK IN FAMILIAR TERMS TO THE RESPONSIVE SPIRIT OF LORELLA MY NATIVE HILLS SHE MURMURED DREAMILY SEE HOW THE FOLIAGE DRINKS THE SUNLIGHT FROM THE HOLLOWS AND DELLS MISSUS BLAYLOCK'S MAIDEN DAYS

ABOUT TWELVE YARDS IN ADVANCE OF US A PROSPEROUS LOOKING CITIZEN WAS ROUNDING A CLUMP OF BUSHES WHERE THE WALK CURVED KNIGHT SUDDENLY DREW A REVOLVER AND SHOT THE MAN IN THE BACK HIS VICTIM FELL AND LAY WITHOUT MOVING
OF AIRING AT THE CLUB SOME OLD CANTING CASTILIAN PROVERB DUG FROM THE HOTCHPOTCH AT THE BACK OF DICTIONARIES CARRUTHERS WHO WAS ONE OF HIS INCONTINENT ADMIRERS
STREETS AND AVENUES WERE SURVEYED PARKS DESIGNED CORNERS OF CENTRAL SQUARES RESERVED FOR THE PROPOSED OPERA HOUSE BOARD OF TRADE LYCEUM MARKET PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND EXPOSITION HALL
RUN DOWN TO SEE ME SOME TIME AT PUNTA REDONDA AND TRY SOME OF OUR STUFF THAT OLD GARCIA SMUGGLES IN IT'S WORTH THE TRIP HALLO HERE'S AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE WHEREVER DID YOU RAKE UP THIS CACTUS TRYSDALE A PRESENT
YOU LOOK JEST LIKE ONE OF THEM HAYSEEDS IN THE PICTURE PAPERS STEAD OF A FREE AND INDEPENDENT SHEEPMAN OF THE STATE O TEXAS SAM CLIMBED AWKWARDLY INTO THE SADDLE
BOTH MEN WERE IN EVENING DRESS WHITE FAVORS LIKE STARS UPON THEIR COATS SHONE THROUGH THE GLOOM OF THE APARTMENT AS HE SLOWLY UNBUTTONED HIS GLOVES
YOU HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY PERFORMED SOME OF THE MOST WONDERFUL FEATS IN YOUR PROFESSION KNOWN TO MODERN CRIME YOU HAVE COMMITTED SOME MARVELLOUS DEEDS UNDER THE VERY NOSES OF THE POLICE
THUS IN THE GREAT GAME OF MUNICIPAL RIVALRY DID OKOCHEE MATCH THAT FAMOUS DRAWING CARD THE HUDSON IT WAS CONCEDED THAT NOWHERE COULD THE PALISADES BE JUDGED SUPERIOR IN THE WAY OF SCENERY AND GRANDEUR
UNAFFECTED SINCERITY THAT WAS REDEEMED FROM BLUFFNESS ONLY BY ITS EXQUISITE CALCULATION WITH THAT PROMPTITUDE AND MASTERLY DECISION OF MANNER THAT SO WELL SUITED HIS CALLING WITH ALL HIS STOCK IN TRADE WELL TO THE FRONT
IN ABOUT TWO HOURS HE DISCOVERED THAT HE WAS LOST THEN CAME THE USUAL CONFUSION OF MIND AND THE HURRY TO GET SOMEWHERE
AT FIRST I WAS ABOUT TER BE A LITTLE RECKLESS AND KICK CAUSE THER BUTTONS WAS ALL OFF BUT SINCE I DISKIVER THAT THE BUTTON HOLES IS ALL BUSTED OUT WHY I WOULDN'T GO SO FUR AS TO SAY THE BUTTONS IS ANY LOSS TO SPEAK OF
MISTER BLOOM STRAYED THOUGHTFULLY BACK TO THE CAPTAIN AND STOOD MEDITATING OUGHT TO BE IN SIGHT OF THE SPIRES AND GILDED DOMES OF SKYLAND NOW IN A FEW MINUTES CHIRRUPED MAC FARLAND SHAKING WITH ENJOYMENT GO TO THE DEVIL SAID MISTER BLOOM STILL PENSIVE
THE CAB STOPPED BEFORE ONE OF THE HANDSOMEST RESIDENCES ON THE AVENUE WALKING UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE WAS A MAN WITH LONG RED WHISKERS WITH A DETECTIVE'S BADGE SHOWING ON THE LAPEL OF HIS COAT
RANDY WOULD CRY AND CALL FOR DADA TO COME STILL THE INTERMINABLE SUCCESSION OF STRETCHES OF BRUSH CACTUS AND MESQUITE HOLLOW AFTER HOLLOW SLOPE AFTER SLOPE ALL EXACTLY ALIKE
THE MOUNTAINS EVER CALL TO THEIR CHILDREN MURMURED MISSUS BLAYLOCK I FEEL THAT LIFE WILL TAKE ON THE ROSY HUE OF HOPE AGAIN IN AMONG THESE BEAUTIFUL HILLS PEYTON A LITTLE TASTE OF THE CURRANT WINE IF YOU WILL BE SO GOOD
I CONSIDER THE PURCHASE A MOST FORTUITOUS ONE IT IS MY INTENTION TO ERECT A SMALL BUILDING UPON IT AT ONCE AND OPEN A MODEST BOOK AND STATIONERY STORE DURING PAST YEARS I HAVE MET WITH MANY PECUNIARY REVERSES
THE LITTLE STEAMBOAT DIXIE BELLE WAS ABOUT TO SHOVE OFF ON HER REGULAR UP THE LAKE TRIP WHEN A RICKETY HIRED CARRIAGE RATTLED UP TO THE PIER AND A TALL ELDERLY GENTLEMAN IN BLACK STEPPED OUT
HE LOOKED RATHER TO BE AN OLD COURTIER HANDED DOWN FROM THE REIGN OF CHARLES AND RE ATTIRED IN A MODERN SUIT OF FINE BUT RAVELING AND SEAM WORN BROADCLOTH YES SIR SAID MISTER BLOOM IN HIS HEARTIEST PROSPECTUS VOICE
INDEED HIS CONCEIT HAD CRUMBLED ITS LAST PROP WAS GONE WHY HAD IT ENDED THUS THERE HAD BEEN NO QUARREL BETWEEN THEM NOTHING
SO HE HAD NEVER LEFT HER ALONE IT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN SAM'S CONSCIENCE AWOKE
IN THE FIRST PLACE I ARGUED THAT AS THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED IN NEW YORK CITY IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN A PUBLIC PLACE AND UNDER PECULIARLY ATROCIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT AS THE MOST SKILFUL SLEUTH AVAILABLE WAS LET LOOSE UPON THE CASE
HE COULD NOT NOW FOR THE PAIN OF IT ALLOW HIS MIND TO DWELL UPON THE MEMORY OF HER CONVINCING BEAUTY THAT NIGHT THE CARELESS WAVE OF HER HAIR THE TENDERNESS AND VIRGINAL CHARM OF HER LOOKS AND WORDS
I HAVEN'T GOT TIME TO DICKER NAME YOUR PRICE IT'S WORTH EIGHT HUNDRED SAID HENRY TOO MUCH DAZED TO ASK MORE THAN ITS VALUE SHUT THAT DOOR SAID MISTER BLOOM TO THE LAWYER THEN HE TORE OFF HIS COAT AND VEST AND BEGAN TO UNBUTTON HIS SHIRT
THEREFORE HE MUST NECESSARILY SET TO WORK AND TRAIL A SHORT MAN WITH A WHITE BEARD WHO LIKES TO BE IN THE PAPERS WHO IS VERY WEALTHY IS FOND OF OATMEAL WANTS TO DIE POOR
GET IT RECORDED AND TAKE IT DOWN AND GIVE IT TO HIM HE'LL ASK YOU A HELL'S MINT OF QUESTIONS
I CALL IT THE SALTATORIAL THEORY WITHOUT BOTHERING WITH THE TEDIOUS MENTAL PHENOMENA NECESSARY TO THE SOLUTION OF A MYSTERY FROM SLIGHT CLUES I JUMP AT ONCE TO A CONCLUSION I WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU THE METHOD I EMPLOYED IN THIS CASE
MISSUS BLAYLOCK TURNED A GLANCE OF SPEAKING TENDERNESS UPON THE COLONEL FINGERED FOR A MOMENT THE SILVERY CURL THAT DROOPED UPON HER BOSOM THEN LOOKED AGAIN TOWARD THE MOUNTAINS
THE PERPETRATOR WOULD NEVER BE DISCOVERED DO YOU NOT THINK MY POSTULATION JUSTIFIED BY PRECEDENT
AS THEIR FOOTPRINTS HAVE ATTESTED
THAT IS ONE PORTENT REASON FOR THE CHANGE WE ARE MAKING MY DEAR CAN YOU NOT RECALL THOSE LINES YOU WROTE ENTITLED I THINK THE GEORGIA HILLS' THE POEM THAT WAS SO EXTENSIVELY COPIED BY THE SOUTHERN PRESS AND PRAISED SO HIGHLY BY THE ATLANTA CRITICS
IT WAS A MERE NOTHING FOR A CATTLEMAN OR A SHEEPMAN TO BE LOST FOR A DAY OR A NIGHT THE THING OFTEN HAPPENED IT WAS MERELY A MATTER OF MISSING A MEAL OR TWO AND SLEEPING COMFORTABLY ON YOUR SADDLE BLANKETS ON A SOFT MATTRESS OF MESQUITE GRASS
FISHERMEN WERE UNDER THE SPELL OF A DEEP AND TOLERANT JOY SAILBOATS AND ROWBOATS FURROWED THE LENIENT WAVES POPCORN AND ICE CREAM BOOTHS SPRANG UP ABOUT THE LITTLE WOODEN PIER
HITCHED UP ITS SUSPENDER AND THREW A GRANITE DAM TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET LONG AND SIXTY FEET HIGH ACROSS THE COOLOOSA ONE MILE ABOVE THE TOWN THEREUPON A DIMPLING SPARKLING LAKE BACKED UP TWENTY MILES AMONG THE LITTLE MOUNTAINS
FOR WHEN HE SAW THAT SWIFT LIMPID UPWARD LOOK THAT SHE GAVE THE MAN WHEN HE TOOK HER HAND HE KNEW HIMSELF TO BE FORGOTTEN ONCE THAT SAME LOOK HAD BEEN RAISED TO HIM AND HE HAD GAUGED ITS MEANING
PERHAPS SO SAID KNIGHT LIGHTLY I WILL ADMIT THAT MY SUCCESS DEPENDS IN A DEGREE UPON THE SORT OF MAN THEY START AFTER ME IF IT SHOULD BE AN ORDINARY PLAIN CLOTHES MAN I MIGHT FAIL TO GAIN A SIGHT OF HIM
STANDING BY A TABLE IN HIS BACHELOR APARTMENTS ON THE TABLE STOOD A SINGULAR LOOKING GREEN PLANT IN A RED EARTHEN JAR THE PLANT WAS ONE OF THE SPECIES OF CACTI
ALL THE WAY FROM SOUTH AMERICA TO CONNIVE AT THE SACRIFICE PLEASE TO OBSERVE HOW LIGHTLY MY GUILT RESTS UPON MY SHOULDERS ONLY LITTLE SISTER I HAD TOO AND NOW SHE'S GONE COME NOW TAKE SOMETHING TO EASE YOUR CONSCIENCE
DO IT SAID I AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SINCERE THANKS OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ON THE NEXT DAY KNIGHT CALLED FOR ME IN A CAB I'VE BEEN ON ONE OR TWO FALSE SCENTS DOCTOR HE ADMITTED
REMOVING HIS WIDE BRIMMED RATHER SHAPELESS BLACK FELT HAT IS IN HOLLY SPRINGS HOLLY SPRINGS GEORGIA I AM VERY PROUD TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE MISTER BLOOM
THINGS HAVE BEEN WHIZZING AROUND OKOCHEE BIGGEST INDUSTRIAL REVIVAL AND WAKING UP TO NATURAL RESOURCES GEORGIA EVER HAD DID YOU HAPPEN TO SQUEEZE IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR IN ANY OF THE GILT EDGED GRAFTS COLONEL WELL SIR SAID THE COLONEL
THESE WERE THE JOINTS IN HIS ARMOR AND HOW FREE FROM EITHER SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN BUT WHY
IS THERE A BOOKSTORE IN TOWN ONE SAID THE LAWYER HENRY WILLIAMS'S GET THERE SAID MISTER BLOOM WE'RE GOING TO BUY IT HENRY WILLIAMS WAS BEHIND HIS COUNTER HIS STORE WAS A SMALL ONE CONTAINING A MIXTURE OF BOOKS STATIONERY AND FANCY RUBBISH
FROM THIS LAST HOPELESS POINT OF VIEW HE STILL STROVE AS IF IT HAD BECOME A HABIT OF HIS MIND TO REACH SOME CONJECTURE AS TO WHY AND HOW HE HAD LOST HER SHAKEN RUDELY BY THE UNCOMPROMISING FACT
THE SPINDLE AND THE FLYWHEEL AND TURBINE WOULD SING THE SHREWD GLORY OF OKOCHEE ALONG THE PICTURESQUE HEIGHTS ABOVE THE LAKE WOULD RISE IN BEAUTY THE COSTLY VILLAS AND THE SPLENDID SUMMER RESIDENCES OF CAPITAL
AND A COUPLE OF DOZEN COPS MY DEAR DOCTOR SAID KNIGHT A LITTLE STIFFLY I WOULD REMIND YOU THAT I AM NO GAMBLER
YOU LOOK UNHAPPY AS IF YOU YOURSELF HAD BEEN MARRIED INSTEAD OF HAVING ACTED MERELY AS AN ACCOMPLICE LOOK AT ME ANOTHER ACCESSORY COME TWO THOUSAND MILES ON A GARLICKY COCKROACHY BANANA STEAMER
THE FATE OF THE GOOD TOWN IS QUICKLY TOLD CAPITAL DECIDED NOT TO INVEST OF ALL THE GREAT THINGS PROMISED THE SCENERY ALONE CAME TO FULFILMENT THE WOODED PEAKS THE IMPRESSIVE PROMONTORIES OF SOLEMN GRANITE
AS SHE HAD SLOWLY MOVED UP THE AISLE TOWARD THE ALTAR HE HAD FELT AN UNWORTHY SULLEN EXULTATION THAT HAD SERVED TO SUPPORT HIM
AND HAVE THEM SEND DOWN A BIG BOX OF NOVELS AND READING MATTER FOR MARTHY THINGS WERE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT HE WONDERED WHETHER A LITTLE PIANO COULD BE PLACED IN ONE OF THE ROOMS OF THE RANCH HOUSE WITHOUT THE FAMILY HAVING TO MOVE OUT OF DOORS
I WILL UNDERTAKE TO BREAK THAT RECORD TO MORROW I WILL TAKE YOU TO SHAMROCK JOLNES I WILL UNMASK HIM BEFORE YOU AND PROVE TO YOU THAT IT IS NOT AN IMPOSSIBILITY FOR AN OFFICER OF THE LAW AND A MANSLAYER TO STAND FACE TO FACE IN YOUR CITY
YOU LAUGHED AT ME BECAUSE YOU SAID THAT DETECTIVES AND MURDERERS NEVER MET IN NEW YORK I HAVE DEMONSTRATED TO YOU THAT THE THEORY IS POSSIBLE BUT HOW DID YOU DO IT I ASKED AGAIN
NO SIR SAID COLONEL BLAYLOCK PAUSING TO ARRANGE THE QUEEN'S WRAP I DID NOT INVEST IN OKOCHEE
HIS DARK EYES STILL FIERY UNDER THE HEAVY BLACK BROWS
SAID J PINKNEY SUDDENLY I WANT YOU TO STOP AT COLD BRANCH THERE'S A LANDING THERE THAT THEY MADE TO USE SOMETIMES WHEN THE RIVER WAS UP CAN'T SAID THE CAPTAIN GRINNING MORE BROADLY I'VE GOT THE UNITED STATES MAILS ON BOARD
IN A LITTLE BOOK HE THOUGHT OF MARTHY AS SHE HAD BEEN WHEN HE FIRST MET HER IN DOGTOWN SMART PRETTY AND SAUCY BEFORE THE SUN HAD TURNED THE ROSES IN HER CHEEKS BROWN AND THE SILENCE OF THE CHAPARRAL HAD TAMED HER AMBITIONS
WITHOUT PROTEST HE ALLOWED HER TO TWINE ABOUT HIS BROW THIS SPURIOUS BAY OF SPANISH SCHOLARSHIP HE LET IT GRACE HIS CONQUERING HEAD
AND THE INHABITANTS HAD TO BE FURNISHED WITH ANOTHER MONTH'S HOMELY RATIONS AS PER AGREEMENT AND THEN SKYLAND WOULD KNOW J PINKNEY BLOOM NO MORE THE OWNERS OF THESE PRECIPITOUS BARREN USELESS LOTS
AND THE FRIO THE RANCH HOUSE A TWO ROOM BOX STRUCTURE WAS ON THE RISE OF A GENTLY SWELLING HILL IN THE MIDST OF A WILDERNESS OF HIGH CHAPARRAL
FAR UP THE LAKE EIGHTEEN MILES ABOVE THE TOWN THE EYE OF THIS CHEERFUL CAMP FOLLOWER OF BOOMS HAD SPIED OUT A GRAFT
IT CONSOLED ITSELF BY DRAWLING SARCASMS AT THE CITY COUNCIL WHICH WAS NOT TO BLAME CAUSING THE FATHERS AS HAS BEEN SAID TO SEEK BACK STREETS AND FIGURE PERSPIRINGLY ON THE SINKING FUND AND THE APPROPRIATION FOR INTEREST DUE
HE GAVE RANDY HIS THREE YEAR OLD SON A PAT ON THE HEAD AND HURRIED OUT TO WHERE MEXICO HIS FAVORITE SADDLE HORSE WAS STANDING
WITH THE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS I HAVE REMAINING I CAN MANAGE THE BUILDING OF A HOUSE BY GIVING A LIEN ON THE LOT I HAVE AN OLD FRIEND IN ATLANTA WHO IS A PARTNER IN A LARGE BOOK STORE AND HE HAS AGREED TO FURNISH ME WITH A STOCK OF GOODS ON CREDIT
THE BIG COUNTRY ROAD RAN JUST BACK OF THE HEIGHTS COLD BRANCH HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE FRISKY AMBITION OF OKOCHEE WITH ITS IMPERTINENT LAKE MAC
AND CONSIDERED THE ARRIVALS WITH EMOTIONLESS EYES SHE HELD A BOOK IN HER LAP WITH HER FINGER HOLDING THE PLACE SAM SHOOK HIMSELF QUEERLY LIKE A MAN COMING OUT OF A DREAM AND SLOWLY DISMOUNTED
BUT THEY HAD BEEN ENOUGH AND THEY HAD BROUGHT HIM TO SPEAK DURING THEIR CONVERSATION SHE HAD SAID AND CAPTAIN CARRUTHERS TELLS ME THAT YOU SPEAK THE SPANISH LANGUAGE LIKE A NATIVE WHY HAVE YOU HIDDEN THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT FROM ME
UNTIL NOW HE HAD BEEN HOPING TO STRIKE THE TRAIL THAT LED TO THE FRIO CROSSING AND THE CHAPMAN RANCH HE MUST HAVE CROSSED IT AT SOME DIM PART OF IT AND RIDDEN BEYOND IF SO HE WAS NOW SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY MILES FROM HOME
MIGHT COME AND VIEW THE SCENE OF THEIR INVESTED CREDULITY OR THEY MIGHT LEAVE THEM TO THEIR FIT TENANTS THE WILD HOG AND THE BROWSING DEER THE WORK OF THE SKYLAND REAL ESTATE COMPANY WAS FINISHED
I WAITED AT MY ADDRESS UNTIL TWO THINKING HE MIGHT CALL THERE I LAUGHED TAUNTINGLY
THE NEXT DAY HE WAITED IMPATIENT IN HIS ROOMS FOR THE WORD AT NOON HER GROOM CAME TO THE DOOR AND LEFT THE STRANGE CACTUS IN THE RED EARTHEN JAR THERE WAS NO NOTE NO MESSAGE
STRAPPED ABOUT HIS FIFTY TWO INCH WAIST A SOFT LEATHER BELT CONTAINING EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BIG BILLS AND SAID THAT ALL WAS VERY GOOD ONE LAST TRIP HE WAS MAKING TO SKYLAND BEFORE DEPARTING TO OTHER SALAD FIELDS
THE YOUTH OF OKOCHEE THEY WHO WERE TO CARRY INTO THE ROSY FUTURE THE BURDEN OF THE DEBT ACCEPTED FAILURE WITH YOUTH'S UNCALCULATING JOY
THERE WAS A BIG LUMP IN HIS THROAT AS HE THOUGHT OF THE CROSS WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HIS WIFE SURELY IT WAS HARD ENOUGH FOR HER TO LIVE IN THAT HORRIBLE COUNTRY WITHOUT HAVING TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF HIS ABUSE HE CURSED HIMSELF GRIMLY AND FELT A SUDDEN FLUSH OF SHAME THAT
NONSENSE MAN I REPLIED WHEN OUR BURGLARS WALK INTO OUR HOUSES AND POLITELY DEMAND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF JEWELS AND THEN DINE AND BANG THE PIANO AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE LEAVING
WITH A PONDEROUS AGILITY HALF PROFESSIONAL AND HALF DIRECTED BY SOME RESURRECTED UNNAMED LONG FORGOTTEN SENTIMENT FORMED A DIVERSIFIED BUT ATTENTIVE COURT THE CURRANT WINE
WITH THAT STRAIGHT FURROW BETWEEN HIS BROWS THAT ALWAYS STOOD AS A SIGNAL OF SCHEMES BEING SHAPED WITHIN THERE'S A GOOD MANY SWINDLES CONNECTED WITH THESE BOOMS HE SAID PRESENTLY
THE SUIT OF READY MADE EFFECTUALLY CONCEALED THE FINE LINES OF HIS STRAIGHT ATHLETIC FIGURE HIS BERRY BROWN FACE WAS SET TO THE MELANCHOLY DIGNITY BEFITTING A PRISONER OF STATE
THAT'S GREAT STUFF MA'AM SAID J PINKNEY BLOOM ENTHUSIASTICALLY WHEN THE POETESS HAD CONCLUDED I WISH I HAD LOOKED UP POETRY MORE THAN I HAVE I WAS RAISED IN THE PINE HILLS MYSELF
NOT TEN YARDS AWAY MARTHY SERENE AND COMFORTABLE SAT IN HER ROCKING CHAIR BEFORE THE DOOR IN THE SHADE OF THE HOUSE WITH HER FEET RESTING LUXURIOUSLY UPON THE STEPS
I AM A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND MISSUS BLAYLOCK'S REALLY WONDERFUL ACQUAINTANCE WITH BELLES LETTRES AND POETIC LITERATURE
INTO SOMETHING MUCH LESS PLEASING TO THE SIGHT THE TIGHT WHITE COLLAR AWKWARDLY CONSTRICTED HIS MUSCULAR MAHOGANY COLORED NECK THE BUTTONLESS SHIRT BULGED IN STIFF WAVES BENEATH HIS UNBUTTONED VEST
THE COOLOOSA RIVER WINDS THROUGH A RANGE OF SMALL MOUNTAINS PASSES OKOCHEE AND THEN BLENDS ITS WATERS TRIPPINGLY AS FALL THE MELLIFLUOUS INDIAN SYLLABLES WITH THE CHATTAHOOCHEE OKOCHEE ROSE AS IT WERE FROM ITS SUNNY SEAT ON THE POST OFFICE STOOP
BUT I COULD NOT FIND A TRACE OF HIM NOR WILL YOU I SAID EMPHATICALLY NOT BY ORDINARY METHODS SAID KNIGHT
THERE IN COMFORTABLE STEAMER CHAIRS THEY SAT AND BEGAN TO PIECE TOGETHER THE RANDOM LINES THAT WERE TO FORM AN INTELLIGENT PARAGRAPH IN THE BIG HISTORY OF LITTLE EVENTS OUR HOME SIR SAID COLONEL BLAYLOCK
NO SAID TRYSDALE WITH THE BITTER WRAITH OF A SMILE IS IT SPANISH YES THE NATIVES IMAGINE THE LEAVES ARE REACHING OUT AND BECKONING TO YOU
HE GAVE MEXICO A SMART KICK WITH HIS HEELS
HE TOLD HIMSELF SO CHILDLIKE AND WORSHIPFUL AND
WAS THE VERY MAN TO HAVE MAGNIFIED THIS EXHIBITION OF DOUBTFUL ERUDITION BUT ALAS THE INCENSE OF HER ADMIRATION HAD BEEN SO SWEET AND FLATTERING HE ALLOWED THE IMPUTATION TO PASS WITHOUT DENIAL
THEY WERE ALL YOURS OF COURSE I HATE TO MENTION THESE THINGS BUT OH COME NOW J P SAID THE CAPTAIN YOU KNOW I WAS JUST FOOLING I'LL PUT YOU OFF AT COLD BRANCH IF YOU SAY SO THE OTHER PASSENGERS GET OFF THERE TOO SAID MISTER BLOOM
HE SAW ALL THE GARBS OF PRETENCE AND EGOISM THAT HE HAD WORN NOW TURN TO RAGS OF FOLLY HE SHUDDERED AT THE THOUGHT THAT TO OTHERS BEFORE NOW THE GARMENTS OF HIS SOUL MUST HAVE APPEARED SORRY AND THREADBARE
I'M NOT A COWARD AS A GENERAL RULE WENT ON THE PROMOTER BUT I ALWAYS SAID THAT IF I EVER MET THE SUCKER THAT BOUGHT THAT LOT I'D RUN LIKE A TURKEY NOW YOU SEE THAT OLD BABE IN THE WOOD OVER THERE WELL HE'S THE BOY THAT DREW THE PRIZE
IT WAS WITH A RAPIDLY BEATING HEART THAT I ACCOMPANIED THIS WONDERFUL AND GIFTED ASSASSIN WHOSE ANALYTICAL GENIUS AND SUPERB SELF CONFIDENCE HAD PROMPTED HIM TO MAKE ME THE TREMENDOUS PROMISE OF BRINGING ME INTO THE PRESENCE OF A MURDERER AND THE NEW YORK DETECTIVE IN PURSUIT OF HIM SIMULTANEOUSLY
WENT ROUND AND THEN J PINKNEY BEGAN TO HEAR SOMETHING OF HOLLY SPRINGS LIFE IT SEEMED FROM THE CONVERSATION OF THE BLAYLOCKS THAT THE SPRINGS WAS DECADENT A THIRD OF THE POPULATION HAD MOVED AWAY BUSINESS AND THE COLONEL WAS AN AUTHORITY ON BUSINESS HAD DWINDLED TO NOTHING
THEY HAVE THREE WITNESSES WHO SAW THE SHOOTING AND GAVE A DESCRIPTION OF ME THE CASE HAS BEEN PLACED IN THE HANDS OF SHAMROCK JOLNES THE FAMOUS DETECTIVE
FREQUENTLY WIND UP AT THEIR STARTING POINT IT WAS WHEN SAM WEBBER WAS FULLEST OF CONTRITION AND GOOD RESOLVES THAT MEXICO WITH A HEAVY SIGH SUBSIDED FROM HIS REGULAR BRISK TROT
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE I SAID ARGUMENTATIVELY AS KNIGHT AND I WALKED ON WAS EASY BUT WHEN YOU COME TO THE TASK OF HUNTING DOWN THE DETECTIVE THAT THEY SEND UPON YOUR TRAIL YOU WILL FIND THAT YOU HAVE UNDERTAKEN A DIFFICULT FEAT
WITHOUT PRELIMINARY OR AFFECTATION OR DEMURRAL SHE BEGAN IN RATHER THRILLING AND MORE DEEPLY PITCHED TONES TO RECITE THESE LINES THE GEORGIA HILLS
MEXICO WAS ANXIOUS TO REDEEM THE SITUATION TWISTING WITH ALACRITY ALONG THE TORTUOUS LABYRINTHS OF THE JUNGLE AT THE MOMENT HIS MASTER'S SURENESS OF THE ROUTE HAD FAILED HIS HORSE HAD DIVINED THE FACT
HE TURNED NOW TO HIS RIGHT UP A LITTLE HILL PEBBLE COVERED UPON WHICH GREW ONLY THE TENACIOUS AND THORNY PRICKLY PEAR AND CHAPARRAL
MISSUS BLAYLOCK BLUSHING LIKE A GIRL SHOOK HER CURL AND GAVE THE COLONEL AN ARCH REPROVING TAP SECRET OF ETERNAL YOUTH WHERE ART THOU EVERY SECOND THE ANSWER COMES HERE HERE
COLONEL BLAYLOCK SAID THE LITTLE ELDERLY LADY SHAKING HER GRAY CURL AND SMILING INDULGENT EXPLANATION AT J PINKNEY BLOOM IS SO DEVOTED TO BUSINESSS HE HAS SUCH A TALENT FOR FINANCIERING AND MARKETS AND INVESTMENTS AND
I MIGHT WALK UP AND DOWN BROADWAY FOR A MONTH WITHOUT SUCCESS BUT YOU HAVE AROUSED MY PRIDE DOCTOR AND IF I FAIL TO SHOW YOU SHAMROCK JOLNES THIS DAY I PROMISE YOU I WILL NEVER KILL OR ROB IN YOUR CITY AGAIN
I KNOW SOMETHING OF DETECTIVES METHODS AND I FOLLOWED OUT A FEW OF THEM EXPECTING TO FIND JOLNES AT THE OTHER END
SO WHEN THE DREAM FADED AND OKOCHEE DROPPED BACK TO DIGGING BAIT AND NURSING ITS TWO AND A HALF PER CENT TAX J PINKNEY BLOOM UNLOVING OF CHECKS AND DRAFTS AND THE COLD INTERROGATORIES OF BANKERS
THERE PASSED THROUGH TRYSDALE'S MIND A SWIFT SCARIFYING RETROSPECT OF THE LAST FEW HOURS IT SEEMED THAT IN HIS NOSTRILS WAS STILL THE SCENT OF THE FLOWERS THAT HAD BEEN BANKED IN ODOROUS MASSES ABOUT THE CHURCH AND IN HIS EARS
NEVER SEEIN NOR HEARIN NOTHIN AND WHAT OTHER MUSEMENT KIN I HAVE NOT IN LISTENIN TO YOU TALK FOR IT'S COMPLAIN COMPLAIN ONE DAY AFTER ANOTHER OH GO ON SAM AND LEAVE ME IN PEACE
IN WHAT PARTICULAR LINE OF BUSINESS YOU INSERTED YOUR COIN I KNOW THAT TOWN AS WELL AS I KNOW THE REGULATIONS FOR ILLEGAL USE OF THE MAILS I MIGHT GIVE YOU A HUNCH AS TO WHETHER YOU CAN MAKE THE GAME GO OR NOT
I HAD A BETTER OPINION OF YOUR SHREWDNESS KNIGHT DURING THE THREE HOURS AND A HALF THAT YOU WAITED HE HAS GOT OUT OF YOUR KEN HE IS AFTER YOU ON TRUE INDUCTION THEORIES NOW
SO SINCERE SHE HAD INVESTED HIM WITH AN ALMOST SUPERNATURAL NUMBER OF HIGH ATTRIBUTES AND EXCELLENCIES AND TALENTS AND HE HAD ABSORBED THE OBLATION AS A DESERT DRINKS THE RAIN
AND IT IS NOT PAST BELIEF THAT ONE MAY REVIEW AN ENTIRE COURTSHIP WHILE REMOVING ONE'S GLOVES
SKYLAND WAS A REGULAR POST OFFICE AND THE STEAMBOAT DIXIE BELLE UNDER CONTRACT DELIVERED THE MAIL BAG GENERALLY EMPTY TWICE A WEEK
I COULD NOT HELP EXCLAIMING AS OUR CAB STARTED ON ITS RETURN TRIP BUT HOW DID YOU DO IT BY WHAT PROCESS OF INDUCTION MY DEAR DOCTOR INTERRUPTED THE GREAT MURDERER THE INDUCTIVE THEORY IS WHAT THE DETECTIVES USE MY PROCESS IS MORE MODERN
I WAS WALKING IN CENTRAL PARK WITH AVERY KNIGHT THE GREAT NEW YORK BURGLAR HIGHWAYMAN AND MURDERER BUT MY DEAR KNIGHT SAID I IT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE
YOU CAN RUN DOWN AND ACTUALLY BRING ME FACE TO FACE WITH THE DETECTIVE ASSIGNED TO APPREHEND YOU I MUST BEG LEAVE TO EXPRESS MY DOUBTS REMEMBER YOU ARE IN NEW YORK
PERHAPS I CAN REPEAT A VERSE OR TWO THE LILY SPRINGS FROM THE ROTTING MOULD PEARLS FROM THE DEEP SEA SLIME GOOD WILL COME OUT OF NAZARETH ALL IN GOD'S OWN TIME TO THE HARDEST HEART THE SOFTENING GRACE COMETH AT LAST TO BLESS
HOW GOES THE MYSTERIOUS MURDER I ASKED AS USUAL SAID KNIGHT SMILINGLY
HE DREW EIGHT ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS FROM HIS MONEY BELT AND PLANKED THEM DOWN ON THE COUNTER MISTER COOLY SHOWED SIGNS OF FUTURE PROMISE FOR HE ALREADY HAD THE DEED SPREAD OUT AND WAS REACHING ACROSS THE COUNTER FOR THE INK BOTTLE
DOUBTLESS SAID THE COLONEL WE SHALL BE ABLE TO SECURE COMFORTABLE ACCOMMODATIONS AT SOME MODEST HOTEL AT REASONABLE RATES OUR TRUNKS ARE IN OKOCHEE TO BE FORWARDED WHEN WE SHALL HAVE MADE PERMANENT ARRANGEMENTS
IN SPITE OF THEIR BICKERINGS WHEN NIGHT CAME MARTHY WAS WONT TO DISMISS HER FEARS OF THE COUNTRY AND REST HER HEAD UPON SAM'S STRONG ARM WITH A SIGH OF PEACEFUL CONTENT AND DEPENDENCE AND WERE HER FEARS SO GROUNDLESS
HE STEPPED FORWARD TO RECEIVE COLONEL AND MISSUS PEYTON BLAYLOCK WITH THE GRACE OF A GRAND MARSHAL OR A WEDDING USHER
THE CROWNING INSTANCE OF HIS FATUOUS AND TARDILY MOURNED EGOISM CAME VIVIDLY BACK TO HIM THE SCENE WAS THE NIGHT WHEN HE HAD ASKED HER TO COME UP ON HIS PEDESTAL WITH HIM AND SHARE HIS GREATNESS
HERE LISTEN TO THINE OWN HEARTBEATS O WEARY SEEKER AFTER EXTERNAL MIRACLES THOSE YEARS SAID MISSUS BLAYLOCK IN HOLLY SPRINGS WERE LONG LONG LONG BUT NOW IS THE PROMISED LAND IN SIGHT SKYLAND A LOVELY NAME
FEW ROYAL LADIES HAVE HELD THEIR ROYAL PREROGATIVE WITH THE SERENE GRACE OF THE PETTED SOUTHERN WOMAN THE COLONEL WITH AN AIR AS GALLANT AND ASSIDUOUS AS IN THE DAYS OF HIS COURTSHIP AND J PINKNEY BLOOM
ON BUSINESS BUSINESS OF IMPORTANCE IN CONNECTION WITH THE RECENT RAPID MARCH OF PROGRESS IN THIS SECTION OF OUR STATE THE COLONEL SMOOTHED BACK WITH A SWEEPING GESTURE HIS LONG SMOOTH LOCKS
OKOCHEE TRUE TO THE INSTINCT OF ITS BLOOD AND CLIME WAS LULLED BY THE SPELL IT CLIMBED OUT OF THE ARENA LOOSED ITS SUSPENDER SAT DOWN AGAIN ON THE POST OFFICE STOOP AND TOOK A CHEW
BUT THE VEHICLE SET OUT AT A SMART PACE UP BROADWAY TURNING PRESENTLY INTO FIFTH AVENUE AND PROCEEDING NORTHWARD AGAIN
THE PRICE OF LOTS RANGED FROM FIVE TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS POSITIVELY NO LOT WOULD BE PRICED HIGHER THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
THE GREAT MURDERER WENT UP TO HIM LEISURELY AND TOOK FROM HIS CLOTHES HIS MONEY WATCH AND A VALUABLE RING AND CRAVAT PIN HE THEN REJOINED ME SMILING CALMLY AND WE CONTINUED OUR WALK
THE OPOSSUM SWUNG BY HIS TAIL OVER THE SITE OF THE EXPOSITION HALL AND THE OWL HOOTED A MELANCHOLY RECITATIVE TO HIS AUDIENCE OF YOUNG SQUIRRELS IN OPERA HOUSE SQUARE
AND PERSUADED A CONTINGENT OF INDIGENT NATIVES TO OCCUPY THEM THEREBY ASSUMING THE ROLE OF POPULATION IN SUBSEQUENT PROSPECTUSES WHICH BECAME ACCORDINGLY MORE SEDUCTIVE AND REMUNERATIVE
FOR THE THOUSANDTH TIME HE REMARSHALLED IN HIS MIND THE EVENTS OF THOSE LAST FEW DAYS BEFORE THE TIDE HAD SO SUDDENLY TURNED SHE HAD ALWAYS INSISTED UPON PLACING HIM UPON A PEDESTAL
TIME WAS OF THE LEAST IMPORTANCE IN THE SCHEDULE OF THE DIXIE BELLE CAPTAIN MAC FARLAND GAVE THE ORDER AND THE BOAT RECEIVED ITS ULTIMATE TWO PASSENGERS FOR UPON THE ARM OF THE TALL ELDERLY GENTLEMAN AS HE CROSSED THE GANGWAY
IN FRONT OF IT WAS A SMALL CLEARING WHERE STOOD THE SHEEP PENS SHEARING SHED AND WOOL HOUSE ONLY A FEW FEET BACK OF IT BEGAN THE THORNY JUNGLE
THAT'S WAY UP IN G THEY'RE GOING TO SKYLAND TO OPEN A BOOK STORE
HE COULD HAVE SWORN AND HE COULD SWEAR NOW THAT UNMISTAKABLE CONSENT WAS IN HER EYES BUT COYLY SHE WOULD GIVE HIM NO DIRECT ANSWER I WILL SEND YOU MY ANSWER TO MORROW SHE SAID
HE HAD SUDDENLY FOUND HIMSELF CONFRONTED BY A THING HE HAD NEVER BEFORE FACED
SAID TRYSDALE FROM A FRIEND KNOW THE SPECIES VERY WELL IT'S A TROPICAL CONCERN SEE HUNDREDS OF EM AROUND PUNTA EVERY DAY HERE'S THE NAME ON THIS TAG TIED TO IT KNOW ANY SPANISH TRYSDALE
OH SHET UP AND RIDE ALONG SAID MISSUS WEBBER WITH A LITTLE JERK AT THE HANDLES OF HER CHAIR YOU ALWAYS FUSSIN BOUT MY READIN I DO A PLENTY AND I'LL READ WHEN I WANTER I LIVE IN THE BRESH HERE LIKE A VARMINT
ALL FAMILIAR BY CONSTANT REPETITION AND YET ALL STRANGE AND NEW IF HE COULD ONLY ARRIVE SOMEWHERE THE STRAIGHT LINE IS ART NATURE MOVES IN CIRCLES A STRAIGHTFORWARD MAN
IS MORE AN ARTIFICIAL PRODUCT THAN A DIPLOMATIST IS
AND HE HAD ACCEPTED HER HOMAGE WITH ROYAL GRANDEUR IT HAD BEEN A VERY SWEET INCENSE THAT SHE HAD BURNED BEFORE HIM
MISSUS BLAYLOCK SIGHED CONTENTEDLY AND TURNED HER EXPRESSIVE EYES STILL AS CLEAR AND UNWORLDLY AS A CHILD'S UPON THE STEEP SLOPES THAT WERE SLOWLY SLIPPING PAST VERY FAIR AND STATELY THEY LOOKED IN THE CLEAR MORNING AIR
SUPPOSE BUSINESS SHOULD BE SORT OF DULL THERE AND NO SPECIAL SALE FOR BOOKS MY DEAR SIR SAID COLONEL BLAYLOCK RESTING HIS HAND UPON THE BACK OF HIS WIFE'S CHAIR
HE MOISTENED HIS DRY LIPS
AND WAS PROVIDED WITH LONG TENTACULAR LEAVES THAT PERPETUALLY SWAYED WITH THE SLIGHTEST BREEZE WITH A PECULIAR BECKONING MOTION TRYSDALE'S FRIEND THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE
NEVER RUN MUCH TO POETRY DID YOU YOUNG MAN
THAT CAN COAX FROM IT NO PROMISE OF BLOSSOM OR FRUIT
SAM WAS GOING TO RIDE OVER TO THE CHAPMAN RANCH TO SEE ABOUT BUYING SOME MORE IMPROVED MERINO RAMS AT LENGTH HE CAME OUT READY FOR HIS RIDE THIS BEING A BUSINESS TRIP OF SOME IMPORTANCE
EVEN YET I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU ARE NOT BEING LED INTO SOME TRAP I ASKED
AND AMONG ITS SOFT CONVOLUTIONS HE DID NOT FEEL THE PRICK OF THE THORN THAT WAS TO PIERCE HIM LATER HOW GLAD HOW SHY HOW TREMULOUS SHE WAS HOW SHE FLUTTERED LIKE A SNARED BIRD WHEN HE LAID HIS MIGHTINESS AT HER FEET
ASKED J PINKNEY BLOOM I DID SIR ANSWERED THE COLONEL WITH THE AIR OF A MODEST MILLIONAIRE EXPLAINING HIS SUCCESS A LOT MOST EXCELLENTLY SITUATED ON THE SAME SQUARE WITH THE OPERA HOUSE AND ONLY TWO SQUARES FROM THE BOARD OF TRADE
HUMBLED NOW HE SOUGHT THE ANSWER AMID THE RUINS OF HIS SELF CONCEIT IF THE VOICE OF THE OTHER MAN IN THE ROOM QUERULOUSLY INTRUDING UPON HIS THOUGHTS AROUSED HIM
IF HE COULD STRIKE A RANCH A CAMP ANY PLACE WHERE HE COULD GET A FRESH HORSE AND INQUIRE THE ROAD HE WOULD RIDE ALL NIGHT TO GET BACK TO MARTHY AND THE KID SO I HAVE HINTED SAM WAS SEIZED BY REMORSE
TWO EVENINGS LATER THEY MET AT A DINNER THEIR GREETINGS WERE CONVENTIONAL BUT SHE LOOKED AT HIM BREATHLESS WONDERING EAGER HE WAS COURTEOUS ADAMANT WAITING HER EXPLANATION
TEN STEPS AND WE MET A POLICEMAN RUNNING TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED AVERY KNIGHT STOPPED HIM I HAVE JUST KILLED A MAN HE ANNOUNCED SERIOUSLY AND ROBBED HIM OF HIS POSSESSIONS
A YOUNG MAN WAS MISTER COOLY AND AWAITING BUSINESS GET YOUR HAT SON SAID MISTER BLOOM IN HIS BREEZY WAY AND A BLANK DEED AND COME ALONG IT'S A JOB FOR YOU NOW HE CONTINUED WHEN MISTER COOLY HAD RESPONDED WITH ALACRITY
GUIDING IT RIGHT TO HELP AND CHEER AND SUCCOR IN DISTRESS I CANNOT REMEMBER THE REST THE LINES WERE NOT AMBITIOUS THEY WERE WRITTEN TO THE MUSIC COMPOSED BY A DEAR FRIEND IT'S A FINE RHYME JUST THE SAME DECLARED MISTER BLOOM
MY SPIRIT DRIFTS IN LONGING SWEET BACK TO THE GEORGIA HILLS AND THROUGH THE CLOSE DRAWN CURTAINED NIGHT I STEAL ON SLEEP'S SLOW WINGS
THERE WERE NO HILLS NOW THAT THEY COULD CLIMB TO OBTAIN A VIEW OF THE COUNTRY THEY CAME UPON A FEW BUT SO DENSE AND INTERLACED WAS THE BRUSH THAT SCARCELY COULD A RABBIT PENETRATE THE MASS THEY WERE IN THE GREAT LONELY THICKET OF THE FRIO BOTTOMS
AND DOCTOR ARABIN HAD PROMISED THAT NO ONE ELSE SHOULD BE IN THE HOUSE IF MISTER CRAWLEY OBJECTED TO SOCIETY BUT THIS WAS NOT WHAT HE WANTED THE FINERY AND GRANDEUR OF THE DEANERY AND THE COMFORT OF THAT WARM SNUG LIBRARY WOULD SILENCE HIM AT ONCE
I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH HARM DONE YET ON EITHER SIDE SHE SAID CHEERILY AH YOU DON'T KNOW FANNY BUT I DO THINK THAT IF I DIE AS I SHALL I FEEL I SHALL AND IF SO I DO THINK IT OUGHT TO GO VERY HARD WITH LADY LUFTON
AFTER I HAVE HAD SO MANY DOSES IT IS NO GOOD TELLING ME ABOUT IT NOW WHEN THE MISCHIEF IS DONE
WHAT ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN AT GATHERUM CASTLE SHE NEVER KNEW WE HOWEVER ARE MORE INTRUSIVE LESS DELICATE IN OUR INQUIRIES AND WE CAN SAY HE HAD A VERY BAD DAY'S SPORT WITH THE WEST BARSETSHIRE
NEITHER OF THE TWO LADIES AT FRAMLEY PARSONAGE KNEW MUCH ABOUT HORSES OR OF THE MANNER IN WHICH ONE GENTLEMAN MIGHT THINK IT PROPER TO OBLIGE ANOTHER BY PURCHASING THE SUPERFLUITIES OF HIS STABLE BUT THEY DID BOTH FEEL THAT THERE WERE HORSES ENOUGH IN THE PARSONAGE STABLE WITHOUT DANDY
IT GALLED HIM HOWEVER TO THINK THAT HE AND HIS WERE SO POORLY DRESSED I AM AFRAID YOU CAN HARDLY FIND A CHAIR MISS ROBARTS SAID MISTER CRAWLEY
DID FORBID LUCY ROBARTS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH LORD LUFTON BUT HER DOUBTS ON THIS SUBJECT IF SHE HELD ANY WERE NOT COMMUNICATED TO HER LADYSHIP IT HAD NEVER ENTERED INTO HER MIND
BUT YOU SEE WHEN ONE IS TRUSTED WITH A WHIP ONE FEELS SUCH A LONGING TO USE IT OH BUT YOU SHOULD KEEP IT STILL I FEEL ALMOST CERTAIN THAT LADY LUFTON WOULD LIKE SUCH A MATCH I DARESAY SHE MIGHT MISS GRANTLY WILL HAVE A LARGE FORTUNE I BELIEVE
A HABIT INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER OF TAKING THE BIT BETWEEN HIS TEETH WHENEVER HE SUSPECTED INTERFERENCE DRIVE HIM GENTLY WITHOUT PULLING HIS MOUTH ABOUT AND YOU MIGHT TAKE HIM ANYWHERE ALMOST AT ANY PACE BUT A SMART TOUCH
WAS THE PERFECTLY COLLECTED MANNER IN WHICH LUCY SPOKE AND CONDUCTED HERSELF THIS CONNECTED AS SHE COULD NOT BUT CONNECT IT WITH THE AIR OF CHAGRIN WITH WHICH LORD LUFTON RECEIVED LUCY'S DECISION MADE IT MANIFEST TO MISSUS ROBARTS
MISSUS ARABIN TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS SO ANXIOUS YOU SHOULD GO TO THEM SAID MISSUS ROBARTS AH YES BUT THAT I FEAR IS IMPOSSIBLE THE CHILDREN YOU KNOW MISSUS ROBARTS
NEARLY OPPOSITE TO PODGENS SHOP SHE SAW LORD LUFTON ON HORSEBACK AND LUCY STANDING BESIDE HIM IT WAS ALREADY NEARLY FIVE O'CLOCK AND IT WAS GETTING DUSK BUT AS SHE APPROACHED OR RATHER
THE INCOME WAS ALREADY HIS OWN
IT WAS NOW THE MONTH OF APRIL AND THE FIELDS WERE BEGINNING TO LOOK GREEN AND THE WIND HAD GOT ITSELF OUT OF THE EAST AND WAS SOFT AND GENIAL AND THE EARLY SPRING FLOWERS WERE SHOWING THEIR BRIGHT COLOURS IN THE PARSONAGE GARDEN AND ALL THINGS WERE SWEET AND PLEASANT
SHE SAID AT LAST WELL TO PREACH TO ME OR TO TALK TO ME OR TO GIVE ME A LESSON TO SAY SOMETHING THAT SHALL DRIVE ME TO PUT MY BACK UP AGAINST LORD LUFTON TO CAUTION YOU DEAREST
DANDY WAS RATHER A THORN IN HIS SIDE THOSE WRETCHED BILLS WERE TO COME DUE EARLY IN MAY AND BEFORE THE END OF APRIL SOWERBY WROTE TO HIM SAYING THAT HE WAS DOING HIS UTMOST TO PROVIDE FOR THE EVIL DAY
HIS NEW DUTIES DO NOT DISTURB HIM MUCH AS YET SAID LUCY AND HIS RIDING OVER HERE WILL BE NO TROUBLE TO HIM YES THERE HE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER ME I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NO HORSE
SPEAKING WITH THE OBJECT OF ASSISTING HER LADYSHIP IN HER EMBARRASSMENT BUT THE TRUTH IS THIS SHE AND LORD LUFTON ARE GETTING INTO THE WAY OF BEING TOO MUCH TOGETHER OF TALKING TO EACH OTHER TOO EXCLUSIVELY
WENT AWAY WHEN THE SPRING CAME LEAVING THEIR HOUSES INNOCENT AND EMPTY THE PARISH DUTY WAS BETTER ATTENDED TO AND PERHAPS DOMESTIC DUTIES ALSO AT SUCH PERIOD HE WAS A PATTERN PARSON AND A PATTERN HUSBAND
OH CERTAINLY BOB MY CHILD
SHE HAD WISHED TO SAY SOMETHING WHICH WOULD CONVEY TO HER SISTER IN LAW AN IDEA OF WHAT LADY LUFTON WOULD DISLIKE BUT IN DOING SO SHE HAD UNINTENTIONALLY BROUGHT AGAINST HER AN ACCUSATION FLIRTING FANNY SAID LUCY
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE GENTLEMAN IS VERY RICH AND A LORD AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING NOBODY FOR A MOMENT ATTRIBUTES ANYTHING WRONG TO YOU LUCY ANYTHING WRONG NO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD BE ANYTHING WRONG EVEN IF I WERE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM
THAT HORACE AND THE IRREGULAR GREEK VERBS SAVOURED TOO MUCH OF PRECOCIOUS FORCING IN A YOUNG LADY OF NINE YEARS OLD BUT NEVERTHELESS GRACE WAS A PRETTY SIMPLE LOOKING GIRL AND CLUNG TO HER ALLY CLOSELY AND SEEMED TO LIKE BEING FONDLED
MISS ROBARTS I AM AFRAID YOU MUST EXCUSE ME SAID HE GETTING UP AND TAKING HIS HAT AND STICK LUCY BEGGED THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE AT ALL IN THE WAY AND ALREADY BEGAN TO SPECULATE HOW SHE MIGHT BEST UNLOAD HER TREASURES
AND THE MAN GOT UP INTO A LADY'S SADDLE I THINK GREGORY WOULD MAKE A BETTER HAND OF IT THAN LUCY THE HORSE CANTERED WITH HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CARRIED A LADY ALL HIS LIFE AND HIS MOUTH IS LIKE VELVET INDEED THAT IS HIS FAULT HE IS TOO SOFT MOUTHED
AND THE SCANTY COMFORT OF THEIR IMPROVED THOUGH STILL WRETCHED INCOME HAD DONE SOMETHING TOWARDS BRINGING HER BACK TO THE WORLD IN WHICH SHE HAD LIVED IN THE SOFT DAYS OF HER CHILDHOOD BUT EVEN THE LIBERAL STIPEND OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS A YEAR
BUT THE PREBENDARY EXPLAINED THAT HE WOULD BE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AT FRAMLEY EVERY WEEK AND THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WOULD ONLY SLEEP AT BARCHESTER ON THE SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS AND PERHAPS NOT ALWAYS THEN
HUNG ALMOST OVER HER ARM AND DOWN HER BACK AS THOUGH HIS HAND HAD TOUCHED AND PERHAPS RESTED ON HER SHOULDER SHE WAS STANDING BY HIS SIDE LOOKING UP INTO HIS FACE WITH ONE GLOVED HAND RESTING ON THE HORSE'S NECK
HE COULD PROVE WITH THE EASIEST VOICE AND MOST JAUNTY MANNER THAT EVERYTHING WAS QUITE SERENE NOW AT THIS PERIOD HE WAS IN THAT MOOD OF SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND HE CALLED LOUDLY FOR THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS FOR DANDY AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED
BUT WHAT CAN I DO I FEAR THAT HE REGARDS THE RICH AS HIS ENEMIES HE IS PINING FOR THE SOLACE OF SOME FRIEND TO WHOM HE COULD TALK FOR SOME EQUAL WITH A MIND EDUCATED LIKE HIS OWN TO WHOSE THOUGHTS HE COULD LISTEN AND TO WHOM HE COULD SPEAK HIS OWN THOUGHTS
AND THEN THE BAG IN A SOLEMN MANNER WAS CARRIED OVER TO THEIR MOTHER WHO TAKING IT FROM HER SON'S HANDS LAID IT HIGH ON A BOOKSHELF AND NOT ONE NOW SAID LUCY ROBARTS VERY PITEOUSLY DON'T BE SO HARD MISTER CRAWLEY NOT UPON THEM BUT UPON ME
SHE MIGHT BE FOOL ENOUGH TO FANCY ANY FOLLY AND MOREOVER PEOPLE WOULD TALK WHY SHOULD HE GO TO THE PARSONAGE NOW MORE FREQUENTLY THAN HE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE LUCY CAME THERE
BUT NEVERTHELESS THE HOUSE WAS MORE JOYOUS TO HER WHEN HE WAS THERE THERE WAS A REASON FOR SOME LITTLE GAIETY WHICH WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED THITHER BY HERSELF BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS SHE DID ENJOY WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT ABOUT BY HIS PRESENCE
HAVE THIS EVIL REMEDIED AND THEN SHE HAD TO DETERMINE ON WHICH STEP SHE WOULD TAKE NOTHING COULD BE MORE REASONABLE THAN LUDOVIC SO AT LEAST SHE SAID TO HERSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN BUT THEN LUDOVIC UNDERSTOOD NOTHING ABOUT SUCH MATTERS
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE WHY PUCK THE PONY WAS BEATEN MARK ROBARTS RETURNED HOME THE DAY AFTER THE SCENE AT THE ALBANY CONSIDERABLY RELIEVED IN SPIRIT
HAD BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE SOUND OF SUGAR PLUMS IN SPITE OF THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY WITHDREW HER HAND FROM HER MUFF AND LOOKED GUILTY WAS SHE NOT DECEIVING THE GOOD MAN NAY TEACHING HIS OWN CHILDREN TO DECEIVE HIM
SHE HAD DECLARED TO HIM PLAINLY THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM AND COULD NOT LOVE HIM AND HAD THUS THROWN AWAY NOT ONLY RICHES AND HONOUR AND HIGH STATION BUT MORE THAN THAT MUCH WORSE THAN THAT SHE HAD FLUNG AWAY FROM HER THE LOVER TO WHOSE LOVE HER WARM HEART CLUNG
AS FOR HER OWN RAIMENT THE WIVES OF FEW ARTISANS WOULD HAVE BEEN CONTENT TO PUT UP WITH MISSUS CRAWLEY'S BEST GOWN THE STUFF OF WHICH IT WAS MADE HAD BEEN PAID FOR BY HER MOTHER WHEN SHE WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY BESTOWED UPON HER DAUGHTER HER MODEST WEDDING TROUSSEAU
FOR SHE HAD WORK OF THIS KIND OF HER OWN AT HOME WHICH SHE BY NO MEANS NEGLECTED THOUGH THE ATTENDANCE OF NURSES WAS MORE PLENTIFUL WITH HER THAN AT HOGGLESTOCK MISSUS CRAWLEY DID GET UP AND TOLD LUCY THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND MISTER CRAWLEY CAME FORWARD GRAMMAR IN HAND LOOKING HUMBLE AND MEEK
TO SIT STILL AND NOT BE ADMIRED WOULD ALMOST SUFFICE FOR HER I DO NOT WORSHIP LADY LUFTON AS YOU DO BUT I THINK QUITE WELL ENOUGH OF HER TO WONDER THAT SHE SHOULD CHOOSE SUCH A GIRL AS THAT FOR HER SON'S WIFE THAT SHE DOES WISH IT I DO NOT DOUBT
SO THAT LUCY ANXIOUSLY WISHED THAT MISTER CRAWLEY COULD BE GOT RID OF AND THE PRESENTS PRODUCED I HOPE YOU HAVE LEFT MISTER ROBARTS QUITE WELL SAID MISTER CRAWLEY WITH A STIFF CEREMONIAL VOICE
MARK COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO SAY THAT HE WOULD PAY NOTHING TILL THE BILLS WERE SAFE AND THEREFORE WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF MISTER FORREST OF THE BANK HE DID REMIT THE PRICE OF DANDY TO HIS FRIEND SOWERBY IN LONDON AND LUCY ROBARTS
DECLARING THAT HE WOULD PAY IT BACK TO HER DURING THE COMING YEAR AND COMFORTING HER HEART BY HIS REJOICING THAT THE PROPERTY HAD NOT BEEN SOLD I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF PARTING WITH AN ACRE OF IT HE HAD SAID OF COURSE NOT LUDOVIC
THERE IS I BELIEVE NOTHING IN HER MENTALLY WHATEVER MAY BE HER MORAL EXCELLENCES TO ME SHE IS MORE ABSOLUTELY LIKE A STATUE THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING I EVER SAW TO SIT STILL AND BE ADMIRED IS ALL THAT SHE DESIRES AND IF SHE CANNOT GET THAT
ALL THIS AS I HAVE SAID WAS VERY NICE IT WAS MANIFEST TO HER LADYSHIP FROM HIS LORDSHIP'S WAY OF TALKING THAT NO VITAL INJURY HAD AS YET BEEN DONE HE HAD NO CARES ON HIS MIND
JUST EXPLAIN TO HER THAT ANY YOUNG LADY WHO TALKS SO MUCH TO THE SAME YOUNG GENTLEMAN WILL CERTAINLY BE OBSERVED THAT PEOPLE WILL ACCUSE HER OF SETTING HER CAP AT LORD LUFTON NOT THAT I SUSPECT HER I GIVE HER CREDIT FOR TOO MUCH PROPER FEELING
ATONING TO HIS OWN CONSCIENCE FOR PAST SHORTCOMINGS BY PRESENT ZEAL AND THEN THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED IT TO HERSELF THE ABSENCE OF HER DEAR FRIEND LADY LUFTON WAS PERHAPS IN ITSELF NOT DISAGREEABLE MISSUS ROBARTS DID LOVE LADY LUFTON HEARTILY
LUCY COULD LISTEN TO THE YOUNG LORD'S VOICE BY THE HOUR TOGETHER WITHOUT BEING DAZZLED IN THE LEAST UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TWO THINGS OCCURRED TO HER SHE WOULD SPEAK EITHER TO HER SON OR TO FANNY ROBARTS AND BY A LITTLE DIPLOMACY
THE REALITIES OF LIFE HAD BECOME SO STERN TO HER THAT THE OUTWARD ASPECTS OF THEM WERE AS NOTHING SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED A NEW GOWN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO HER IF ALL THE COUNTY KNEW THAT THE ONE IN WHICH SHE WENT TO CHURCH HAD BEEN TURNED THREE TIMES
SHE WAS YOUNGER AND BRIGHTER WHEN HE WAS THERE THINKING MORE OF THE FUTURE AND LESS OF THE PAST SHE COULD LOOK AT HIM AND THAT ALONE WAS HAPPINESS TO HER AND THEN HE WAS PLEASANT MANNERED WITH HER JOKING WITH HER
NOW THIS DID DISTURB LADY LUFTON NOT A LITTLE AND THEN LUCY TOOK IT ALL SO QUIETLY ON HER FIRST ARRIVAL AT FRAMLEY SHE HAD BEEN SO SHY SO SILENT
THE ENJOYMENT OF ONE'S OWN HAPPINESS AT SUCH WINDFALLS DEPENDS SO MUCH ON THE FREE AND FREELY EXPRESSED ENJOYMENT OF OTHERS LADY LUFTON'S CONGRATULATIONS HAD NEARLY MADE HIM THROW UP THE WHOLE THING BUT HIS WIFE'S SMILES RE ENCOURAGED HIM
SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE BLOW IN HAVING BEEN THUS MADE THE SUBJECT OF REMARK WITH REFERENCE TO LORD LUFTON SHE KNEW THAT HER PLEASANT EVENINGS AT FRAMLEY COURT WERE NOW OVER AND THAT SHE COULD NOT AGAIN TALK TO HIM IN AN UNRESTRAINED TONE
AND THERE WAS JELLY FOR THE SICK CHILD AND CHICKEN BROTH WHICH WAS INDEED ANOTHER JELLY AND TO TELL THE TRUTH OPENLY THERE WAS ALSO A JOINT OF FRESH PORK AND A BASKET OF EGGS FROM THE FRAMLEY PARSONAGE FARMYARD WHICH MISSUS ROBARTS WAS TO INTRODUCE SHOULD SHE FIND HERSELF CAPABLE OF DOING SO
I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IT'S NO USE YOUR LOOKING AT ME FANNY YOU WILL MAKE ME TALK OF IT AND I WON'T TELL A LIE ON THE SUBJECT I DO LIKE LORD LUFTON VERY MUCH AND I DO DISLIKE GRISELDA GRANTLY ALMOST AS MUCH
AND IN THE EVENING HE AND SOWERBY HAD PLAYED BILLIARDS SOWERBY HAD WON A POUND OR TWO AND THAT HAD BEEN THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE DONE BUT THOSE SAUNTERINGS OVER TO THE PARSONAGE MIGHT BE MORE DANGEROUS
WELL NO I DON'T THINK THERE IS SAID LADY LUFTON NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF BUT A LITTLE CHAT BETWEEN YOU AND ME MAY PERHAPS SET MATTERS RIGHT WHICH OTHERWISE MIGHT BECOME TROUBLESOME IS IT ABOUT LUCY
WHICH SHE KNEW WAS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THAT ORDINARY COMFORTABLE MASCULINE FRIENDSHIP WITH THE IDEA OF WHICH SHE HAD ONCE SATISFIED HERSELF WAS NOT FANNY RIGHT WHEN SHE SAID THAT INTIMATE FRIENDSHIPS OF THAT NATURE WERE DANGEROUS THINGS
MOVING A PILE OF RAGGED COVERLESS BOOKS ON TO THE TABLE I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME FOR MOVING THEM THEY ARE NOT BOB'S AT LEAST NOT THE MOST OF THEM BUT MINE SAID THE GIRL BUT SOME OF THEM ARE MINE SAID THE BOY AIN'T THEY GRACE
AND THEN LADY LUFTON PAUSED FOR A MOMENT FOR SHE ELOQUENT AND DISCREET AS SHE ALWAYS WAS FELT HERSELF RATHER AT A LOSS FOR WORDS TO EXPRESS HER EXACT MEANING I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO WITHOUT HER SAID FANNY
YES MY DEAR ABOUT LUCY SHE IS A VERY NICE GOOD GIRL AND A CREDIT TO HER FATHER AND A GREAT COMFORT TO US SAID FANNY I AM SURE SHE IS SHE MUST BE A VERY PLEASANT COMPANION TO YOU AND SO USEFUL ABOUT THE CHILDREN BUT
AND INDEED LADY LUFTON HAD A WORD OR TWO TO SAY ON THAT SUBJECT ALSO ONLY NOT EXACTLY NOW A HUNTING PARSON WAS NOT AT ALL TO HER TASTE BUT THAT MATTER MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN ABEYANCE FOR A FEW DAYS
WHICH THEY KNEW IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE IN MISTER CRAWLEY'S PRESENCE SHE AS WE HAVE SAID WAS NOT QUITE SO GAUNT NOT ALTOGETHER SO HAGGARD AS IN THE LATTER OF THOSE DREADFUL CORNISH DAYS LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ARABIN BETWEEN THEM
THEN OLD DAYS WOULD HAVE COME BACK TO THEM BUT NOW ARABIN ALWAYS RIDES ON A SLEEK FINE HORSE NOW A DAYS HE ONCE SAID TO HIS WIFE WITH A SNEER
I HOPE THERE IS NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF SAID FANNY SPEAKING BY NO MEANS IN A DEFIANT TONE BUT HUMBLY AS IT WERE AND DEPRECATING HER LADYSHIP'S WRATH FANNY HAD GAINED ONE SIGNAL VICTORY OVER LADY LUFTON
AND SHE KNOWS AN ODE OF HORACE ALL BY HEART SAID BOB AN ODE OF HORACE SAID LUCY STILL HOLDING THE YOUNG SHAMEFACED FEMALE PRODIGY CLOSE TO HER KNEES IT IS ALL THAT I CAN GIVE THEM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY APOLOGETICALLY
SAID FANNY ALMOST FRIGHTENED AT THE PROPOSAL OF COURSE IT IS OUT OF THE QUESTION FANNY SAID LUCY NOW SPEAKING RATHER SERIOUSLY IN THE FIRST PLACE I WOULD NOT TAKE LORD LUFTON'S HORSE IN THE SECOND PLACE I WOULD NOT TAKE LADY MEREDITH'S HABIT
ONE OF THESE WAS NOW ILL WITH CROUP AND IT WAS WITH THE OBJECT OF OFFERING TO THE MOTHER SOME COMFORT AND SOLACE THAT THE PRESENT VISIT WAS MADE THE TWO LADIES GOT DOWN FROM THEIR CARRIAGE HAVING OBTAINED THE SERVICES OF A BOY TO HOLD PUCK AND SOON FOUND THEMSELVES IN MISSUS CRAWLEY'S SINGLE SITTING ROOM
BUT A TITLE AND AN ESTATE AND AN INCOME ARE MATTERS WHICH WILL WEIGH IN THE BALANCE WITH ALL EVE'S DAUGHTERS AS THEY DO WITH ALL ADAM'S SONS PRIDE OF PLACE AND THE POWER OF LIVING WELL IN FRONT OF THE WORLD'S EYE ARE DEAR TO US ALL ARE DOUBTLESS INTENDED TO BE DEAR
AND HE OUGHT ALSO SO LADY LUFTON THOUGHT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH A YOUNG EMBRYO BRIDE OF HIS OWN MOTHER'S CHOOSING AND THEN IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO HAVE HIM THERE IN THE HOUSE
BUT WHAT WOULD THE WORLD COME TO IF NONE BUT ABSOLUTE TRUE HEROES WERE TO BE THOUGHT WORTHY OF WOMEN'S LOVE WHAT WOULD THE MEN DO AND WHAT OH WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THE WOMEN
AND THEN HER LADYSHIP IN REFERENCE TO THE SAME TROUBLE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO MANAGE HER INVITATIONS TO THE PARSONAGE THESE HITHERTO HAD BEEN VERY FREQUENT AND SHE HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THINKING THAT THEY COULD HARDLY BE TOO MUCH SO
THAT HER SON'S ACRES MIGHT BE PROTECTED FROM THE MILLIONNAIRES AND OTHER PHILISTINES WHY YES I DON'T EXACTLY WANT TO SEE A JEW TAILOR INVESTING HIS EARNINGS AT LUFTON SAID THE LORD HEAVEN FORBID SAID THE WIDOW
SOME ONE ELSE ALSO HAD LEARNED THAT PAPA WAS GONE FOR WHILE BOB AND GRACE WERE STILL COUNTING THE BIG LUMPS OF SUGAR CANDY EACH EMPLOYED THE WHILE FOR INWARD SOLACE WITH AN INCH OF BARLEY SUGAR THE FRONT DOOR OPENED AND A BIG BASKET AND A BUNDLE DONE UP IN A KITCHEN CLOTH
BUT STILL IT MAY BE WELL THAT YOU SHOULD JUST SAY A WORD TO HER A LITTLE MANAGEMENT NOW AND THEN IN SUCH MATTERS IS SO USEFUL BUT WHAT SHALL I SAY TO HER
BUT NOT EVEN FOR THEM COULD SHE PERMIT HER SON'S PROSPECTS IN LIFE TO BE ENDANGERED THERE WAS NOTHING MORE SAID BETWEEN THEM AND MISSUS ROBARTS GOT UP TO TAKE HER LEAVE HAVING PROMISED TO SPEAK TO LUCY
THE HOUSE WILL NOT BE FURNISHED WILL IT MARK SAID HIS WIFE I DON'T KNOW HOW WE SHALL GET ON DON'T FRIGHTEN YOURSELVES I SHALL TAKE LODGINGS IN BARCHESTER AND WE SHALL NOT SEE YOU ALL THE TIME SAID MISSUS ROBARTS WITH DISMAY
AND THEN AGAIN THEY WERE SILENT FOR A MOMENT AS MISSUS ROBARTS DID NOT FEEL THAT SHE HAD ANYTHING FURTHER TO SAY ON THE MATTER POISON SHOULD BE THE WORD WITH ANY ONE SO FATAL AS LORD LUFTON AND HE OUGHT TO BE MADE UP OF SOME PARTICULAR COLOUR
LIBERAL ACCORDING TO THE SCALE BY WHICH THE INCOMES OF CLERGYMEN IN SOME OF OUR NEW DISTRICTS ARE NOW APPORTIONED WOULD NOT ADMIT OF A GENTLEMAN WITH HIS WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN LIVING WITH THE ORDINARY COMFORTS OF AN ARTISAN'S FAMILY
AS TO MAKE HER SISTER IN LAW QUITE SURE THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO LOVE PASSAGES UP TO THAT TIME AND NOTHING HAD SINCE OCCURRED WHICH HAD CREATED ANY SUSPICION IN MISSUS ROBARTS MIND SHE HAD SEEN AT ONCE THAT ALL THE CLOSE INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM WAS OVER AND THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE
ALMOST AS PENNILESS AS THE CURATE HIMSELF THEN THEY WOULD WALK TOGETHER FOR HOURS ALONG THE ROCK BOUND SHORE LISTENING TO THE WAVES DISCUSSING DEEP POLEMICAL MYSTERIES SOMETIMES WITH HOT FURY THEN AGAIN WITH TENDER LOVING CHARITY
THIS WAS VERY DISCOURAGING TO LUCY IF ONE SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS CREATED SO GREAT A DIFFICULTY HOW WAS SHE TO DISPOSE OF THE POT OF GUAVA JELLY AND BOX OF BONBONS WHICH WERE STILL IN HER MUFF OR HOW DISTRIBUTE THE PACKET OF ORANGES WITH WHICH THE PONY CARRIAGE WAS LADEN
SHE GOT FANNY UP INTO HER OWN DEN ONE AFTERNOON AND SEATED HER DISCREETLY IN AN EASY ARM CHAIR MAKING HER GUEST TAKE OFF HER BONNET AND SHOWING BY VARIOUS SIGNS THAT THE VISIT WAS REGARDED AS ONE OF GREAT MOMENT FANNY SHE SAID
THAT ALL THE WORK OF HER MIND SHOULD BE GIVEN UP TO SUCH SUBJECTS AS THESE BUT NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD BEAR IT SHE SAID AS LONG AS HE WOULD CARRY HIMSELF LIKE A MAN AND FACE HIS LOT BOLDLY BEFORE THE WORLD AND THEN SHE TOLD HOW HE HAD BEEN BETTER THERE AT HOGGLESTOCK THAN IN THEIR FORMER RESIDENCE DOWN IN CORNWALL
WHY DIDN'T SHE LABEL HIM DANGEROUS IN TIME AND THEN THEY WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND UP TO THEIR OWN ROOMS IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ANY ONE TO UNDERSTAND LUCY'S STATE OF MIND AT PRESENT AND IT CAN HARDLY BE SAID THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD IT HERSELF
ON THE DAY AFTER HIS RETURN HE RECEIVED PROPER AUTHENTIC TIDINGS OF HIS PRESENTATION TO THE PREBEND HE WAS IN FACT ALREADY PREBENDARY
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE HERO IN A FAMILY DOES THAT GIVE YOU A RIGHT TO EXPECT ANOTHER SAID MISSUS ROBARTS OF ALL MY OWN ACQUAINTANCE MISSUS CRAWLEY I THINK COMES NEAREST TO HEROISM AND THEN THEY PASSED BY THE HOGGLESTOCK SCHOOL AND MISTER CRAWLEY WHEN HE HEARD THE NOISE OF THE WHEELS CAME OUT
OH BY GOD'S MERCY VERY LITTLE AS FOR ME I SHALL GET OVER IT IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS I DON'T DOUBT THAT'S IF I CAN GET ASS'S MILK AND CHANGE OF AIR WE'LL TAKE YOU TO BARCHESTER FOR THAT BUT AS I WAS SAYING I REALLY DO THINK LORD LUFTON LIKES GRISELDA GRANTLY
AND LUDOVIC LIKE ALL YOUNG MEN IS PERHAPS IGNORANT THAT HIS ATTENTIONS MAY BE TAKEN TO MEAN MORE THAN HE INTENDS
NOT A WORD HAD BEEN SPOKEN BETWEEN THEM ABOUT LORD LUFTON SINCE THAT EVENING NOW MORE THAN A MONTH AGO ON WHICH THEY HAD BEEN WALKING TOGETHER IN THE GARDEN LUCY HAD SO DEMEANED HERSELF ON THAT OCCASION
AND MOREOVER THE GINGERBREAD HAD BEEN TAKEN DOWN IN THE AUDACITY OF THEIR COMMERCIAL SPECULATIONS AND THE NUTS WERE SPREAD OUT UPON A BOARD BEHIND WHICH LUCY STOOD AS SHOP GIRL DISPOSING OF THEM FOR KISSES MAMMA MAMMA SAID BOBBY RUNNING UP TO HIS MOTHER YOU MUST BUY SOMETHING OF HER
WE ARE GOING TO DRIVE OVER TO HOGGLESTOCK THIS MORNING FANNY SAID ONE DAY AT BREAKFAST I SUPPOSE MARK YOU WON'T GO WITH US
AND NECESSARY TO MENTION AND YET IT IS A VERY DELICATE AFFAIR TO SPEAK OF FANNY OPENED HER EYES AND SAID THAT SHE HOPED THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG NO MY DEAR I THINK NOTHING IS WRONG
LADY LUFTON WAS NOT A WOMAN WHO ALLOWED HER LIFE TO BE WHAT PEOPLE IN COMMON PARLANCE CALL DULL SHE HAD TOO MANY DUTIES AND THOUGHT TOO MUCH OF THEM
BUT YOUNG LADIES SOMETIMES ALLOW THEMSELVES TO FALL IN LOVE AND THEN TO THINK THEMSELVES VERY ILL USED JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD NO IDEA IN THEIR HEAD I WILL PUT HER ON HER GUARD IF YOU WISH IT LADY LUFTON EXACTLY MY DEAR
THAT HIS HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS DID NOT GO HAND IN HAND TOGETHER BY THE BY HE DESIRED US TO SAY THAT HE WILL CALL HERE TO MORROW AT ABOUT ELEVEN DIDN'T HE SAY FANNY YES
THEY WALKED ON IN SILENCE FOR A MINUTE OR TWO TILL THEY REACHED THE PARSONAGE GATE AND THEN LUCY SAID LAUGHING CAN'T YOU FANCY ME SITTING ON THAT GREAT BIG HORSE
WELL I SUPPOSE IT'S A GOOD THING TO HAVE LAND IN THE MARKET SOMETIMES SO THAT THE MILLIONNAIRES MAY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR MONEY GOD FORBID THAT YOURS SHOULD BE THERE AND THE WIDOW MADE A LITTLE MENTAL PRAYER
BUT SUCH A FRIEND MUST BE EQUAL NOT ONLY IN MIND BUT IN PURSE AND WHERE CAN HE EVER FIND SUCH A MAN AS THAT BUT YOU MAY GET BETTER PREFERMENT AH NO AND IF HE DID WE ARE HARDLY FIT FOR IT NOW IF I COULD THINK THAT I COULD EDUCATE MY CHILDREN
I HAVE LEFT A BOOK BEHIND ME HE SAID AND COMING BACK THROUGH THE ROOM HE TOOK UP THE WELL WORN PRAYER BOOK WHICH ACCOMPANIED HIM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS THROUGH THE PARISH BOBBY WHEN HE SAW HIS FATHER HAD RETREATED A FEW STEPS BACK AS ALSO DID GRACE WHO TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
WHAT IS THAT BOB SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GINGERBREAD FALTERED BOBBY FEELING THAT A SIN HAD BEEN COMMITTED THOUGH PROBABLY FEELING ALSO THAT HE HIMSELF COULD HARDLY AS YET BE ACCOUNTED AS DEEPLY GUILTY MISS ROBARTS SAID THE FATHER WE ARE VERY MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
SHE WAS DRIVEN TO CONFESS THAT THE LABEL WOULD IN TRUTH BE NOW TOO LATE THAT THE CAUTION HAD COME TO HER AFTER THE POISON HAD BEEN SWALLOWED WAS THERE ANY ANTIDOTE THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS LEFT FOR HER TO CONSIDER
LUCY FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER CRAWLEY THE MORE SO AS MISSUS ROBARTS AND MISSUS CRAWLEY PRESENTLY WITHDREW INTO A BEDROOM TAKING THE TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN WITH THEM HOW UNLUCKY THOUGHT LUCY THAT SHE HAS NOT GOT MY MUFF WITH HER
IT WAS WHEN SHE WAS QUITE ALONE AT NIGHT IN HER OWN ROOM OR IN HER SOLITARY WALKS THAT A SINGLE SILENT TEAR WOULD GATHER IN THE CORNER OF HER EYE AND GRADUALLY MOISTEN HER EYELIDS SHE NEVER TOLD HER LOVE NOR DID SHE ALLOW CONCEALMENT TO FEED ON HER DAMASK CHEEK
IT WILL BE BETTER THAT I SHOULD UNDERSTAND YOU AT ONCE AND THEN THEY AGAIN MOVED AWAY FROM THE HOUSE TELL ME TRULY NOW DO YOU THINK THAT LORD LUFTON AND I HAVE BEEN FLIRTING I DO THINK THAT HE IS A LITTLE INCLINED TO FLIRT WITH YOU
STANDING STILL IN THE PATH AND LOOKING UP INTO HER COMPANION'S FACE WITH ALL HER EYES
LET IT BE EVER SO SLIGHT WOULD BRING HIM ON HIS HAUNCHES AND THEN IT MIGHT BE A QUESTION WHETHER YOU COULD GET HIM ANOTHER MILE THAT DAY SO THAT ON THE WHOLE LADY LUFTON THOUGHT THAT THE OTHER PLAN WOULD BE THE BEST I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT LADY LUFTON WAS RIGHT
AND WAS IT NOT INCUMBENT ON HER TO MAKE SOME KINDLY USE OF ALL THE GOODS WITH WHICH PROVIDENCE HAD BLESSED HERSELF AND THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE SITTING ROOM EACH AGAIN WITH A YOUNG CHILD IN HER ARMS
WAS PARTICULARLY ANXIOUS TO CREATE NO ILL FEELING AND WISHED THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE AND ON GOOD TERMS WITH EVERYBODY ELSE BUT YET THE TRUTH WAS FORCED OUT OF HER WHEN THIS QUESTION WAS ASKED SO SUDDENLY NOT TO LECTURE YOU LUCY
NOT THAT IT EVER OCCURRED TO LADY LUFTON AS POSSIBLE THAT HER SON SHOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH LUCY ROBARTS LUCY'S PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS WERE NOT OF A NATURE TO GIVE GROUND FOR SUCH A FEAR AS THAT BUT HE MIGHT TURN THE GIRL'S HEAD WITH HIS CHATTER
THAT HER LOVE DID CLING TO HIM SHE KNEW EVEN THEN AND OWNED MORE THOROUGHLY AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE SO MUCH HER PRIDE HAD DONE FOR HER AND THAT STRONG RESOLVE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD NOT SCOWL ON HER AND TELL HER THAT SHE HAD ENTRAPPED HER SON
I SUPPOSE THAT'S THE SAME SORT OF THING AS A MAN BEING SOFT HEARTED SAID LUCY EXACTLY YOU OUGHT TO RIDE THEM BOTH WITH A VERY LIGHT HAND THEY ARE DIFFICULT CATTLE TO MANAGE BUT VERY PLEASANT WHEN YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT
HASTE AND SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND MEN RUNNING TO AND FRO WITH BLANK ACCEPTANCES IN THEIR HANDS COULD ALONE STAVE OFF THE CRACK OF DOOM BUT AT OTHER TIMES WHEN RETALIATORY APPLICATIONS WERE MADE TO HIM
TO FEEL HERSELF SO DIFFERENT FROM THE WIVES OF OTHER CLERGYMEN AROUND HER TO KNOW THAT THEY LIVED SOFTLY WHILE SHE WITH ALL THE WORK OF HER HANDS AND UNCEASING STRUGGLE OF HER ENERGIES COULD HARDLY MANAGE TO PLACE WHOLESOME FOOD BEFORE HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING A GRIEVOUS THING TO THINK OF
AS REGARDS THE MERE EATING AND DRINKING THE AMOUNTS OF BUTCHER'S MEAT AND TEA AND BUTTER THEY OF COURSE WERE USED IN QUANTITIES WHICH ANY ARTISAN WOULD HAVE REGARDED AS COMPATIBLE ONLY WITH DEMI STARVATION BETTER CLOTHING FOR HER CHILDREN WAS NECESSARY AND BETTER CLOTHING FOR HIM
FOR FEAR HE SHOULD BE SWALLOWED IN MISTAKE YOU WILL BE SAFE YOU SEE SAID FANNY LAUGHING AS YOU HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY CAUTIONED AS TO THIS INDIVIDUAL BOTTLE AH
LOOKING UP FOR A MOMENT FROM THE ANXIOUS DISCUSSION IN WHICH SHE WAS ALREADY ENGAGED WITH MISSUS CRAWLEY ON NURSERY MATTERS PRAY TELL HIM SAID MISTER CRAWLEY THAT I SHALL BE HAPPY TO SEE HIM
WELL LUCY WE MUST DRIVE OURSELVES THAT'S ALL YOU SHALL BE CHARIOTEER GOING AND THEN WE'LL CHANGE COMING BACK TO ALL WHICH LUCY AGREED AND AS SOON AS THEIR WORK IN THE SCHOOL WAS OVER THEY STARTED
LUCY HAD BEEN ENGAGED THE WHILE WITH THE CHILDREN AND WHEN THE TWO MARRIED LADIES ENTERED THEY FOUND THAT A SHOP HAD BEEN OPENED AT WHICH ALL MANNER OF LUXURIES WERE BEING READILY SOLD AND PURCHASED AT MARVELLOUSLY EASY PRICES THE GUAVA JELLY WAS THERE AND THE ORANGES AND THE SUGAR PLUMS RED AND YELLOW AND STRIPED
THAT LADY LUFTON HAD SYMPATHIZED WITH HER AND ENCOURAGED HER SHE HAD ENDEAVOURED TO MODERATE THE BLAZE OF HER OWN SPLENDOUR IN ORDER THAT LUCY'S UNACCUSTOMED EYES MIGHT NOT BE DAZZLED BUT ALL THIS WAS CHANGED NOW
BUT SHE DID NOT BETRAY HERSELF PERHAPS HE MAY SHE SAID AND THEN GAVE THE PONY A LITTLE TOUCH WITH HER WHIP OH LUCY I WON'T HAVE PUCK BEATEN HE WAS GOING VERY NICELY I BEG PUCK'S PARDON
GO RIDING ABOUT THE COUNTRY ON HIS HORSES WHAT HAVE I DONE FANNY THAT YOU SHOULD SUPPOSE SUCH A THING YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING DEAREST
GOD HAS TRIED US WITH WANT AND FOR MY CHILDREN'S SAKE I AM GLAD OF SUCH RELIEF BUT WILL HE BE ANGRY I WILL MANAGE IT DEAR MISSUS ROBARTS YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED AT HIM HIS LOT IS SOMETIMES VERY HARD TO BEAR
IF LUCY WOULD PERSIST IN SECURING TO HERSELF SO MUCH OF LORD LUFTON'S TIME AND ATTENTION HER VISITS TO FRAMLEY COURT MUST BECOME LESS FREQUENT LADY LUFTON WOULD DO MUCH VERY MUCH INDEED FOR HER FRIENDS AT THE PARSONAGE
I KNOW IT WILL BE SAID OF LORD LUFTON HIMSELF THAT PUTTING ASIDE HIS PEERAGE AND BROAD ACRES AND HANDSOME SONSY FACE HE WAS NOT WORTH A GIRL'S CARE AND LOVE
THAT A MATCH WAS POSSIBLE BETWEEN LORD LUFTON AND LUCY ROBARTS NOR HAD SHE THE SLIGHTEST WISH TO ENCOURAGE IT NOW THAT THE IDEA WAS SUGGESTED TO HER ON SUCH A MATTER SHE COULD SYMPATHIZE WITH LADY LUFTON THOUGH SHE DID NOT COMPLETELY AGREE WITH HER
SUCH THINGS ARE SO MUCH WORSE FOR A MAN THAN FOR A WOMAN FANNY WAS NOT QUITE PREPARED TO ADMIT THIS IN HER OWN HEART BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY ON THAT HEAD I AM SURE I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO BE OF USE TO YOU SHE SAID IF YOU WILL ONLY LOOK UPON ME AS AN OLD FRIEND AND WRITE TO ME IF YOU WANT ME
AND LADY LUFTON HAS BEEN ASKING YOU TO LECTURE ME ABOUT IT POOR MISSUS ROBARTS HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY SHE THOUGHT WELL OF ALL THE PERSONS CONCERNED AND WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO BEHAVE WELL BY ALL OF THEM
AND ARE YOU A GREAT SCHOLAR ASKED LUCY DRAWING THE CHILD TO HER I DON'T KNOW SAID GRACE WITH A SHEEPISH FACE I AM IN GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY PUT UP HER HANDS WITH ASTONISHMENT
FANNY WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK HOW VERY DIFFERENT THOSE TWO ARE SHE SAID DIFFERENT IN THEIR MINDS AND IN THEIR SPIRIT BUT HOW MUCH HIGHER TONED IS HER MIND THAN HIS HOW WEAK HE IS IN MANY THINGS AND HOW STRONG SHE IS IN EVERYTHING
AND HIS LORDSHIP GIVING ME MY FIRST LESSON I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD LIKE IT SAID FANNY I'M SURE SHE WOULD NOT BUT I WILL NOT TRY HER TEMPER IN THAT RESPECT SOMETIMES I FANCY THAT SHE DOES NOT EVEN LIKE SEEING LORD LUFTON TALKING TO ME
THE MISTRESS OF SUCH A DESTINY WHAT MORE OR WHAT BETTER COULD THE WORLD HAVE DONE FOR HER AND NOW SHE HAD THROWN ALL THAT ASIDE BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT ENDURE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD CALL HER A SCHEMING ARTFUL GIRL ACTUATED BY THAT FEAR SHE HAD REPULSED HIM WITH A FALSEHOOD
BECAUSE I WISHED TO PUT YOU ON YOUR GUARD YOU KNOW LUCY THAT I DO NOT INTEND TO FIND FAULT WITH YOU BUT YOU MAY BE SURE AS A RULE
MANY A NIGHT AS SHE LAY THINKING ON HER PILLOW SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT NO MONEY HAD EVER BEEN BETTER EXPENDED SINCE IT HAD BROUGHT HIM BACK TO HIS OWN HOUSE HE HAD THANKED HER FOR IT IN HIS OWN OPEN WAY
THAT LORD LUFTON WAS ANNOYED BECAUSE LUCY WOULD NOT CONSENT TO LEARN TO RIDE WHEREAS SHE LUCY HERSELF HAD GIVEN HER REFUSAL IN A FIRM AND DECIDED TONE AS THOUGH RESOLVED THAT NOTHING MORE SHOULD BE SAID ABOUT IT
AND THAT THE PURCHASING OF A HUNTER WITH THE VIEW OF IMMEDIATELY SELLING HIM AGAIN WAS TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT AN OPERATION HARDLY CONGENIAL WITH THE USUAL TASTES AND PURSUITS OF A CLERGYMAN I HOPE YOU DID NOT GIVE VERY MUCH MONEY FOR HIM MARK SAID FANNY
AS SHE CAME SUDDENLY WITHIN SIGHT OF THEM SHE COULD SEE THAT THEY WERE IN CLOSE CONVERSATION LORD LUFTON'S FACE WAS TOWARDS HER AND HIS HORSE WAS STANDING STILL HE WAS LEANING OVER TOWARDS HIS COMPANION AND THE WHIP WHICH HE HELD IN HIS RIGHT HAND
AND THEN LUCY BEGAN PETTING THE LITTLE BOY AND BY DEGREES SLIPPED A SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS OUT OF HER MUFF INTO HIS HANDS SHE HAD NOT THE PATIENCE NECESSARY FOR WAITING AS HAD HER SISTER IN LAW THE BOY TOOK THE BAG PEEPED INTO IT AND THEN LOOKED UP INTO HER FACE
I SUPPOSE I SHALL HAVE TO GO INTO RESIDENCE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SAID MARK RECURRING TO THE MORE AGREEABLE SUBJECT OF THE STALL
AND HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGERS AT THE SHOP GIRL YOU MUST GIVE HER TWO KISSES FOR THAT HEAP OF BARLEY SUGAR LOOKING AT BOBBY'S MOUTH AT THE TIME ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HIS KISSES MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH WHEN THEY WERE AGAIN IN THE PONY CARRIAGE BEHIND THE IMPATIENT PUCK AND WERE WELL AWAY FROM THE DOOR
TOO MUCH FRIGHTENED AND LASTLY IT IS QUITE OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR A GREAT MANY OTHER VERY GOOD REASONS NONSENSE SAID LORD LUFTON A GREAT DEAL OF NONSENSE SAID LUCY LAUGHING BUT ALL OF IT OF LORD LUFTON'S TALKING
BUT ALWAYS WITH A MUTUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF EACH OTHER'S TRUTH NOW THEY LIVED COMPARATIVELY NEAR TOGETHER BUT NO OPPORTUNITIES AROSE FOR SUCH DISCUSSIONS AT ANY RATE ONCE A QUARTER MISTER CRAWLEY WAS PRESSED BY HIS OLD FRIEND TO VISIT HIM AT THE DEANERY
THE PONY CARRIAGE IS WRETCHED FOR THREE OH AS FOR THAT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE NEW HORSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CARRY YOU AS FAR AS THAT I HEARD YOU SAY YOU WANTED TO SEE MISTER CRAWLEY SO I DO AND THE NEW HORSE AS YOU CALL HIM SHALL CARRY ME THERE TO MORROW
CHAPTER THIRTEEN DELICATE HINTS LADY LUFTON HAD BEEN GREATLY REJOICED AT THAT GOOD DEED WHICH HER SON DID IN GIVING UP HIS LEICESTERSHIRE HUNTING AND COMING TO RESIDE FOR THE WINTER AT FRAMLEY IT WAS PROPER AND BECOMING
LORD LUFTON WANTS ME TO LEARN TO RIDE SAID SHE
AND I REGARDED IT AS A MERE COMMONPLACE POWDER GOOD FOR THE COMPLEXION I WONDER WHETHER IT'S TOO LATE OR WHETHER THERE'S ANY ANTIDOTE MISSUS ROBARTS DID NOT ALWAYS QUITE UNDERSTAND HER SISTER IN LAW AND NOW SHE WAS A LITTLE AT A LOSS
THEY THEN WALKED UP TO THE HALL DOOR IN SILENCE WHEN THEY HAD REACHED IT LUCY STOOD IN THE DOORWAY INSTEAD OF ENTERING IT AND SAID FANNY LET US TAKE ANOTHER TURN TOGETHER IF YOU ARE NOT TIRED NO I'M NOT TIRED
SAID FANNY NOT KNOWING WHAT ANSWER TO MAKE TO SUCH A PROPOSITION YES SAID HE THIS HORSE WOULD CARRY HER BEAUTIFULLY HE IS AS QUIET AS A LAMB AND I MADE GREGORY GO OUT WITH HIM YESTERDAY WITH A SHEET HANGING OVER HIM LIKE A LADY'S HABIT
IF I THOUGHT IT HAD COME TO THAT I SHOULD RECOMMEND THAT SHE SHOULD BE SENT AWAY ALTOGETHER I AM SURE SHE IS NOT SO FOOLISH AS THAT I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING IN IT AT ALL LADY LUFTON I DON'T THINK THERE IS MY DEAR
THEREFORE I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IF THEY BECOME MAN AND WIFE HOWEVER
NOW FANNY YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALL LIKED YOUR SISTER IN LAW LUCY VERY MUCH
AT THE END OF THE LAST CHAPTER WE LEFT LUCY ROBARTS WAITING FOR AN INTRODUCTION TO MISSUS CRAWLEY WHO WAS SITTING WITH ONE BABY IN HER LAP WHILE SHE WAS ROCKING ANOTHER WHO LAY IN A CRADLE AT HER FEET MISTER CRAWLEY IN THE MEANWHILE HAD RISEN FROM HIS SEAT WITH HIS FINGER BETWEEN THE LEAVES OF AN OLD GRAMMAR
I WONDER WHETHER THEY CAUTIONED GRISELDA GRANTLY WHEN SHE WAS HERE I SUPPOSE WHEN YOUNG LORDS GO ABOUT ALL THE GIRLS ARE CAUTIONED AS A MATTER OF COURSE
AND HER PRINCIPLES ARE UPRIGHT BUT PEOPLE WILL TALK OF HER YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT FANNY AS WELL AS I DO FANNY COULD NOT HELP MEDITATING WHETHER PROPER FEELING EDUCATION AND UPRIGHT PRINCIPLES
INDEED AFTER WHAT MISTER SOWERBY HAD SAID AND AFTER LORD LUFTON'S ASSENT TO IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS HE CONSIDERED TO DECLINE IT AND THEN TOO MISTER SOWERBY'S PROMISE ABOUT THE BILLS WAS VERY COMFORTABLE TO HIM AFTER ALL
WHY WAS LUDOVIC SO SLOW IN THAT AFFAIR OF GRISELDA GRANTLY WHY SO OFTEN IN THESE LATTER WINTER DAYS DID HE SAUNTER OVER TO THE PARSONAGE AND THEN THAT TERRIBLE VISIT TO GATHERUM CASTLE
SAID FANNY BUT THEY WILL EACH OF THEM GET WRONG IDEAS ABOUT THE OTHER AND ABOUT THEMSELVES LUCY WILL PERHAPS THINK THAT LUDOVIC MEANS MORE THAN HE DOES AND LUDOVIC WILL
BUT THAT IF THE PRICE OF DANDY COULD BE REMITTED TO HIM AT ONCE IT WOULD GREATLY FACILITATE HIS OBJECT NOTHING COULD BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN MISTER SOWERBY'S TONE ABOUT MONEY AT DIFFERENT TIMES WHEN HE WANTED TO RAISE THE WIND EVERYTHING WAS SO IMPORTANT
NEVER LET THE ESTATE DECREASE IN YOUR HANDS IT IS ONLY BY SUCH RESOLUTIONS AS THAT THAT ENGLISH NOBLEMEN AND ENGLISH GENTLEMEN CAN PRESERVE THEIR COUNTRY I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE PROPERTY CHANGING HANDS
SHE HAD HAD COURAGE ENOUGH AND PRESENCE OF MIND TO JOKE ABOUT THE MATTER WHEN HER SISTER IN LAW SPOKE TO HER AND YET SHE WAS QUITE AWARE THAT IT WAS NO JOKING MATTER LORD LUFTON HAD NOT ABSOLUTELY MADE LOVE TO HER BUT HE HAD LATTERLY SPOKEN TO HER IN A MANNER
OH NO I COULD NOT PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR GOODNESS IN THAT WAY BUT HE WOULD NOT GO HE COULD GO AND LEAVE ME AT HOME SOMETIMES I HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE SO AND I HAVE DONE ALL IN MY POWER TO PERSUADE HIM I HAVE TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD MIX ONCE MORE WITH THE WORLD WITH THE CLERICAL WORLD YOU KNOW
MARK THINKS THAT AS HE IS SO NEAR HE NEED NOT BE MUCH ABSENT FROM FRAMLEY EVEN DURING HIS RESIDENCE AND THEN LADY LUFTON IS SO GOOD ABOUT THE SCHOOLS AH YES BUT LADY LUFTON IS NOT A CLERGYMAN MISS ROBARTS
IT WAS ON LUCY'S TONGUE TO SAY THAT HER LADYSHIP WAS PRETTY NEARLY AS BAD BUT SHE STOPPED HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT PROVIDENCE SENT GREAT RELIEF TO MISS ROBARTS IN THE SHAPE OF MISSUS CRAWLEY'S RED ARMED MAID OF ALL WORK WHO WALKING UP TO HER MASTER
AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WITH A PRUDENCE EQUAL TO HER GENEROSITY FELT THAT SHE COULD AFFORD TO BE SUBMISSIVE IT MIGHT PERHAPS NOT BE LONG BEFORE SHE WOULD BE EQUALLY ANXIOUS TO CONQUER AGAIN
AND THEN STICK IN HAND HE WALKED FORTH AND LUCY FANCIED THAT BOBBY'S EYES IMMEDIATELY RESTED ON THE BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS BOB SAID SHE ALMOST IN A WHISPER
SHE DOES NOT LIKE IT LUCY WHEN SHE SEES HIM FLIRTING WITH YOU THIS MISSUS ROBARTS SAID RATHER GRAVELY WHEREAS LUCY HAD BEEN SPEAKING IN A HALF BANTERING TONE AS SOON AS EVEN THE WORD FLIRTING WAS OUT OF FANNY'S MOUTH
AND THEN SHE IS QUIET AND RESERVED SHE DOES NOT REQUIRE EXCITEMENT AND I AM SURE IS CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HER DUTIES VERY CONSCIENTIOUS I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID LUCY WITH SOMETHING LIKE A SNEER IN HER TONE BUT THE QUESTION I SUPPOSE IS
BUT IT WAS NOT QUITE SO EASY TO SAY WHAT LUDOVIC MIGHT DO OR THINK BUT LADY LUFTON WENT ON I AM SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND ME FANNY WITH YOUR EXCELLENT SENSE AND TACT LUCY IS CLEVER AND AMUSING AND ALL THAT
AND SHE KNEW THE REST AS WELL AS THOUGH IT HAD ALL BEEN SPOKEN I NEED HARDLY TELL YOU THAT FOR I AM SURE WE HAVE SHOWN IT YOU HAVE INDEED AS YOU ALWAYS DO AND YOU MUST NOT THINK THAT I AM GOING TO COMPLAIN CONTINUED LADY LUFTON
AND APPEARED TO BE LOST IN THOUGHT WHILE THE MULTITUDE BEFORE HER CONTINUED TO GROVEL UPON THEIR STOMACHS
NOW I WAS STILL SUFFICIENTLY SENSIBLE TO REMEMBER THAT IT IS NOT PLEASANT IN SUCH A SITUATION AS OURS WAS TO HAVE PASSAGES RUNNING INTO ONE'S BED CHAMBER FROM NO ONE KNOWS WHERE IF THERE ARE PASSAGES PEOPLE CAN COME UP THEM THEY CAN COME UP WHEN ONE IS ASLEEP
FOR A MOMENT SHE STOOD THERE BROODING AND THEN CAST HERSELF DOWN ON HER KNEES BESIDE THE FORM AND BEGAN TO PRESS HER LIPS AGAINST THE SHEET AND WEEP THERE WAS SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE ABOUT THE SIGHT OF THIS AWE INSPIRING WOMAN LETTING LOOSE HER PASSION ON THE DEAD
ALL RIGHT ANSWERED MY FRIEND NOTHING EASIER I KNOW VINCEY I'LL INTRODUCE YOU AND HE DID AND FOR SOME MINUTES WE STOOD CHATTING ABOUT THE ZULU PEOPLE I THINK FOR I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM THE CAPE AT THE TIME PRESENTLY HOWEVER
BUT HAD REMAINED STANDING AND DEPARTED WITH HIS UNDERLINGS DOWN A PASSAGE TO THE RIGHT THEN CAME A SILENCE
BUT IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THAT A WOMAN COULD EXIST FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS THIS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE ALSO ANYTHING MIGHT BE POSSIBLE I MYSELF MIGHT FOR AUGHT I KNEW BE A REINCARNATION OF SOME OTHER FORGOTTEN SELF
DRAWN BY SOME SENSATION OR ATTRACTION THAT I CANNOT DEFINE I FOLLOWED ON MY STOCKINGED FEET FALLING WITHOUT NOISE ON THE SMOOTH AND ROCKY FLOOR WHEN I HAD TRAVERSED SOME FIFTY YARDS OF SPACE I CAME TO ANOTHER PASSAGE RUNNING AT RIGHT ANGLES AND HERE AN AWFUL THING HAPPENED TO ME
THE ARMS FELL AND THE FLAME SANK UP THEY WENT AGAIN AND THE BROAD TONGUE OF FIRE SHOT UP AFTER THEM AND THEN AGAIN THEY FELL CURSE HER MEMORY
SINCE IT WAS EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE THAT THE ACQUAINTANCE WOULD END IN A TRANSFER OF HER AFFECTIONS HE WAS ALTOGETHER TOO GOOD LOOKING AND WHAT IS MORE HE HAD NONE OF THAT CONSCIOUSNESS AND CONCEIT ABOUT HIM WHICH USUALLY AFFLICTS HANDSOME MEN
THE WHITE ROBE SLIPPED FROM HER DOWN TO HER GOLDEN GIRDLE BARING THE BLINDING LOVELINESS OF HER FORM SHE STOOD THERE HER FINGERS CLENCHED AND THE AWFUL LOOK OF MALEVOLENCE GATHERED AND DEEPENED ON HER FACE
AND WHAT IS MORE THEY HAD THE WEIGHT OF TRUTH TAKING ONE THING WITH ANOTHER IT APPEARED TO ME TO BE AN UTTER IMPOSSIBILITY THAT WE SHOULD ESCAPE FROM THE PLACE WE WERE SUPPOSING THAT LEO RECOVERED AND SUPPOSING THAT SHE WOULD LET US GO WHICH WAS EXCEEDINGLY DOUBTFUL
WE GIVE YOU COMPLETE FREEDOM AND AS A REWARD YOU WILL WE BELIEVE HAVE THE CREDIT OF PRESENTING TO THE WORLD THE MOST WONDERFUL HISTORY AS DISTINGUISHED FROM ROMANCE THAT ITS RECORDS CAN SHOW READ THE MANUSCRIPT WHICH I HAVE COPIED OUT FAIRLY FOR YOUR BENEFIT
PARTLY TO SEE WHERE IT WENT TO AND PARTLY FROM A RESTLESS DESIRE TO BE DOING SOMETHING I FOLLOWED THE PASSAGE IT LED TO A STONE STAIR WHICH I DESCENDED THE STAIR ENDED IN ANOTHER PASSAGE OR RATHER TUNNEL ALSO HEWN OUT OF THE BED ROCK
OR TAKE VENGEANCE ON ANYTHING SO LOW WHAT CAN IT PROFIT ME TO BE AVENGED ON SUCH AS THESE THOSE WHO LIVE LONG MY HOLLY HAVE NO PASSIONS SAVE WHERE THEY HAVE INTERESTS THOUGH I MAY SEEM TO SLAY IN WRATH OR BECAUSE MY MOOD IS CROSSED
YOUR LIVES WOULD NOT BE SAFE AMONG THIS PEOPLE FOR A DAY THOU KNOWEST THEM NOT THEY ARE TIGERS TO LAP BLOOD AND EVEN NOW THEY HUNGER FOR YOUR LIVES HOW THINKEST THOU THAT I RULE THIS PEOPLE I HAVE BUT A REGIMENT OF GUARDS TO DO MY BIDDING
NO MERELY MORTAL WOMAN COULD SHINE WITH SUCH A SUPERNATURAL RADIANCE ABOUT THAT SHE HAD AT ANY RATE BEEN IN THE RIGHT IT WAS NOT SAFE FOR ANY MAN TO LOOK UPON SUCH BEAUTY I WAS A HARDENED VESSEL IN SUCH MATTERS
SOME YEARS AGO I THE EDITOR WAS STOPPING WITH A FRIEND VIR DOCTISSIMUS ET AMICUS NEUS AT A CERTAIN UNIVERSITY WHICH FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS HISTORY WE WILL CALL CAMBRIDGE
COME ON MY SON COME SWIFTLY I TURNED AND FOLLOWED HIM DOWN THE PASSAGE AND WHEN WE REACHED THE GREAT CENTRAL CAVE SAW THAT MANY AMAHAGGER SOME ROBED AND SOME MERELY CLAD IN THE SWEET SIMPLICITY OF A LEOPARD SKIN WERE HURRYING ALONG IT
BUT AS I WENT ON I ABANDONED THAT IDEA ALSO TO ME THE STORY SEEMS TO BEAR THE STAMP OF TRUTH UPON ITS FACE ITS EXPLANATION I MUST LEAVE TO OTHERS AND WITH THIS SLIGHT PREFACE
SUDDENLY SHE CEASED RAISED HERSELF TO HER FEET REARRANGED HER ROBE AND TOSSING BACK HER LONG LOCKS IMPATIENTLY SWEPT ACROSS TO WHERE THE FIGURE LAY UPON THE STONE
AS I WAS FORCED TO OWN TO MYSELF EVEN NOW IN THE SOBER LIGHT OF DAY SHE HERSELF HAD ATTRACTIONS THAT I COULD NOT FORGET NOT EVEN THE DREADFUL SIGHT WHICH I HAD WITNESSED DURING THE NIGHT COULD DRIVE THAT FOLLY FROM MY MIND AND ALAS THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO ADMIT IT
A STOUTISH LADY WHOSE NAME I DO NOT REMEMBER CAME ALONG THE PAVEMENT ACCOMPANIED BY A PRETTY FAIR HAIRED GIRL AND THESE TWO MISTER VINCEY WHO CLEARLY KNEW THEM WELL AT ONCE JOINED WALKING OFF IN THEIR COMPANY
FOR TWENTY MINUTES OR MORE I CREPT ALONG
YE HAVE HEARD SAID SHE AT LENGTH IN A COLD CLEAR VOICE VERY DIFFERENT FROM HER USUAL TONES INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS ABOUT THIS EXTRAORDINARY CREATURE
WHOSE NAME I DISCOVERED WAS HOLLY WHEN HE SAW THE LADIES ADVANCING HE SUDDENLY STOPPED SHORT IN HIS TALK CAST A REPROACHFUL LOOK AT HIS COMPANION AND WITH AN ABRUPT NOD TO MYSELF TURNED AND MARCHED OFF ALONE ACROSS THE STREET
IN ADDITION HIS FACE WAS ALMOST WITHOUT FLAW A GOOD FACE AS WELL AS A BEAUTIFUL ONE AND WHEN HE LIFTED HIS HAT WHICH HE DID JUST THEN TO A PASSING LADY I SAW THAT HIS HEAD WAS COVERED WITH LITTLE GOLDEN CURLS GROWING CLOSE TO THE SCALP
FIRST YE HAVE ATTACKED THESE STRANGERS BEING WHITE MEN AND WOULD HAVE SLAIN THEIR SERVANT AND FOR THAT ALONE DEATH IS YOUR REWARD BUT THAT IS NOT ALL YE HAVE DARED TO DISOBEY ME
AND WITH MY SIN EVER BEFORE ME OH THAT FOR ME LIFE CANNOT BRING FORGETFULNESS OH FOR THE WEARY YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN AND ARE YET TO COME AND EVERMORE TO COME ENDLESS AND WITHOUT END MY LOVE MY LOVE
FEELING IN MY TREMBLING HEART THAT I HAD SEEN A VISION OF A SOUL IN HELL ON I STUMBLED I SCARCELY KNOW HOW TWICE I FELL ONCE I TURNED UP THE BISECTING PASSAGE BUT FORTUNATELY FOUND OUT MY MISTAKE IN TIME
THE WHITE FLAME OF THE FIRE LEAPT UP AFTER THEM ALMOST TO THE ROOF THROWING A FIERCE AND GHASTLY GLARE UPON SHE HERSELF UPON THE WHITE FIGURE BENEATH THE COVERING AND EVERY SCROLL AND DETAIL OF THE ROCKWORK DOWN CAME THE IVORY ARMS AGAIN
I A FELLOW OF MY COLLEGE NOTED FOR WHAT MY ACQUAINTANCES ARE PLEASED TO CALL MY MISOGYNY AND A RESPECTABLE MAN NOW WELL ON IN MIDDLE LIFE HAD FALLEN ABSOLUTELY AND HOPELESSLY IN LOVE WITH THIS WHITE SORCERESS NONSENSE IT MUST BE NONSENSE
SUPPOSING SHE SHOULD HEAR ME OR SEE ME THROUGH THE CURTAIN SUPPOSING I EVEN SNEEZED OR THAT HER MAGIC TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS BEING WATCHED SWIFT INDEED WOULD BE MY DOOM DOWN CAME THE CLENCHED HANDS TO HER SIDES THEN UP AGAIN ABOVE HER HEAD
I CAN DO IT AND SHE HELD OUT HER HANDS OVER THE SHEETED DEAD WHILE HER WHOLE FRAME BECAME RIGID AND TERRIBLE TO SEE AND HER EYES GREW FIXED AND DULL I SHRANK IN HORROR BEHIND THE CURTAIN
JOB LAID GREAT EMPHASIS ON THE FOOLS
OR IS THE TRUE EXPLANATION WHAT I BELIEVE IT TO BE NAMELY THAT AYESHA SEEING FURTHER THAN WE CAN SEE PERCEIVED THE GERM AND SMOULDERING SPARK OF GREATNESS WHICH LAY HID WITHIN HER LOVER'S SOUL
AND IF I VENTURES TO INTERFERE IT'S AWFUL TO SEE HER HER HAIR SEEMS TO STAND ON END AND SHE CURSES AND SWEARS AWAY IN HER HEATHEN TALK AT LEAST I FANCY SHE MUST BE CURSING FROM THE LOOK OF HER AND WHAT DO YOU DO THEN I MAKE HER A PERLITE BOW AND I SAY
AY OH QUEEN NEARLY ALL OF THEM I SAID AND I SAW THEM GLOWER AT ME AS I SAID IT THEN TELL TO ME AND THIS GREAT COMPANY THE TALE WHEREOF I HAVE HEARD
THUS ADJURED I IN AS FEW WORDS AS I COULD RELATED THE HISTORY OF THE CANNIBAL FEAST AND OF THE ATTEMPTED TORTURE OF OUR POOR SERVANT THE NARRATIVE WAS RECEIVED IN PERFECT SILENCE BOTH BY THE ACCUSED AND BY THE AUDIENCE
BY HORACE HOLLY A NAME THAT AT THE MOMENT WAS NOT FAMILIAR TO ME IT RAN AS FOLLOWS
INFORMING THE SUBSTANCE OF A MORTAL WHO YET DREW HER STRENGTH FROM EARTH AND IN WHOSE HUMAN BOSOM PASSIONS YET ROSE AND FELL AND BEAT AS IN THE UNDYING WORLD AROUND HER THE WINDS AND THE TIDES RISE AND FALL AND BEAT UNCEASINGLY
FOR THEN SHALL I OVERTAKE HER WITH MY VENGEANCE AND UTTERLY DESTROY HER AND SO ON THE FLAME ROSE AND FELL REFLECTING ITSELF IN HER AGONISED EYES THE HISSING SOUND OF HER TERRIBLE MALEDICTIONS
AND MAKES THEM DESERVEDLY DISLIKED BY THEIR FELLOWS THAT SAME EVENING
I SLID INTO THE VAULT LIKE APARTMENT AND LOOKED ROUND THERE WAS A LIGHT BY WHICH I COULD SEE THAT LEO WAS LYING ON THE COUCH TOSSING RESTLESSLY IN HIS FEVER BUT ASLEEP AT HIS SIDE HALF LYING ON THE FLOOR HALF LEANING AGAINST THE STONE COUCH
HOW IS MISTER LEO JOB MUCH THE SAME SIR IF HE DON'T SOON MEND HE'LL END SIR AND THAT'S ALL ABOUT IT THOUGH I MUST SAY THAT THAT THERE SAVAGE USTANE DO DO HER BEST FOR HIM ALMOST LIKE A BAPTISED CHRISTIAN
GOOD GRACIOUS I SAID TO MY FRIEND WITH WHOM I WAS WALKING
SHE HAD WARNED ME FAIRLY AND I HAD REFUSED TO TAKE THE WARNING CURSES ON THE FATAL CURIOSITY THAT IS EVER PROMPTING MAN TO DRAW THE VEIL FROM WOMAN AND CURSES ON THE NATURAL IMPULSE THAT BEGETS IT IT IS THE CAUSE OF HALF
OR BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID OF RIDICULE AND DOUBT BEING CAST UPON OUR STATEMENTS I HOLD ONE VIEW ABOUT THIS MATTER AND LEO HOLDS ANOTHER AND FINALLY AFTER MUCH DISCUSSION WE HAVE COME TO A COMPROMISE NAMELY TO SEND THE HISTORY TO YOU
SHE WAS CLOTHED AS I HAD SEEN HER WHEN SHE UNVEILED IN THE KIRTLE OF CLINGING WHITE CUT LOW UPON HER BOSOM AND BOUND IN AT THE WAIST WITH THE BARBARIC DOUBLE HEADED SNAKE AND AS BEFORE HER RIPPLING BLACK HAIR FELL IN HEAVY MASSES DOWN HER BACK
TWO THOUSAND YEARS SHE MOANED
WHICH WOULD HAVE REDUCED MARK TAPLEY HIMSELF TO MISERY IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES ON THE DAIS WAS A RUDE CHAIR OF BLACK WOOD INLAID WITH IVORY HAVING A SEAT MADE OF GRASS FIBRE AND A FOOTSTOOL FORMED OF A WOODEN SLAB ATTACHED TO THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CHAIR
FORMED A STRONGER AND MORE IMPASSABLE FORTIFICATION ROUND THE VARIOUS AMAHAGGER HOUSEHOLDS THAN ANY THAT COULD BE BUILT OR DESIGNED BY MAN NO THERE WAS BUT ONE THING TO DO FACE IT OUT AND SPEAKING FOR MY OWN PART
BUT SHE STOPPED THEM NAY SHE SAID IN HER SOFTEST VOICE STAND I PRAY YOU STAND PERCHANCE THE TIME WILL SOON BE WHEN YE SHALL GROW WEARY OF BEING STRETCHED OUT AND SHE LAUGHED MELODIOUSLY
SUDDENLY I THOUGHT OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF SHE DISCOVERED ME AND THE REFLECTION MADE ME TURN SICK AND FAINT BUT EVEN IF I HAD KNOWN THAT I MUST DIE IF I STOPPED I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I COULD HAVE MOVED FOR I WAS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATED BUT STILL I KNEW MY DANGER
OR PERHAPS THE LAST OF A LONG LINE OF ANCESTRAL SELVES WELL VIVE LA GUERRE WHY NOT ONLY UNFORTUNATELY I HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF THESE PREVIOUS CONDITIONS THE IDEA WAS SO ABSURD TO ME THAT I BURST OUT LAUGHING
P S OF COURSE IF ANY PROFIT RESULTS FROM THE SALE OF THE WRITING SHOULD YOU CARE TO UNDERTAKE ITS PUBLICATION YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU LIKE WITH IT BUT IF THERE IS A LOSS I WILL LEAVE INSTRUCTIONS WITH MY LAWYERS MESSRS GEOFFREY AND JORDAN TO MEET IT
EXACTLY AS IT HAPPENED AS REGARDS SHE HERSELF I HAVE NOTHING TO ADD DAY BY DAY WE GAVE GREATER OCCASION TO REGRET THAT WE DID NOT BETTER AVAIL OURSELVES OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION
AND SHE IS GONE THEN SHE RECOMMENCED WITH AN EVEN MORE FRIGHTFUL ENERGY CURSE HER WHERE SHE IS LET MY CURSES REACH HER WHERE SHE IS AND DISTURB HER REST CURSE HER THROUGH THE STARRY SPACES
AND THE FIERCE LIGHT AND DEEP GLOOM
FILLING THE WORLD WITH LIGHT AND FRAGRANCE HERE ALSO I AM NOT ABLE TO ANSWER BUT MUST LEAVE THE READER TO FORM HIS OWN JUDGMENT ON THE FACTS BEFORE HIM
SO MUCH MORE HORRIBLE EVEN THAN ANYTHING THAT HAD GONE BEFORE THAT I COULD NO LONGER BEAR TO LOOK AT IT AND TURNING BEGAN TO CREEP SHAKING AS I WAS IN EVERY LIMB SLOWLY ALONG THE PITCH DARK PASSAGE
BUT THOUGH CENTURY DOTH STILL CREEP ON TO CENTURY AND TIME GIVE PLACE TO TIME THE STING OF MEMORY HATH NOT LESSENED THE LIGHT OF HOPE DOTH NOT SHINE MORE BRIGHT OH TO HAVE LIVED TWO THOUSAND YEARS WITH ALL MY PASSION EATING OUT MY HEART
IF ONCE I GOT CONFUSED AS TO THE DIRECTION AND THEN PAUSED TO THINK WHAT WAS I TO DO I HAD NO MATCH IT SEEMED AWFUL TO ATTEMPT THAT LONG JOURNEY BACK THROUGH THE UTTER GLOOM AND YET I COULD NOT STAND THERE ALL NIGHT AND IF I DID
YOUNG WOMAN YOUR POSITION IS ONE THAT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND AND CAN'T RECOGNISE LET ME TELL YOU THAT I HAS A DUTY TO PERFORM TO MY MASTER AS IS INCAPACITATED BY ILLNESS
MY LOVE WHY DID THAT STRANGER BRING THEE BACK TO ME AFTER THIS SORT FOR FIVE HUNDRED YEARS I HAVE NOT SUFFERED THUS OH IF I SINNED AGAINST THEE HAVE I NOT WIPED AWAY THE SIN WHEN WILT THOU COME BACK TO ME WHO HAVE ALL
MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN MY DEAR SIR YOU WILL BE SURPRISED CONSIDERING THE VERY SLIGHT NATURE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE TO GET A LETTER FROM ME
AND HIS WHISKERS GREW RIGHT UP TO HIS HAIR SO THAT THERE WAS UNCOMMONLY LITTLE OF HIS COUNTENANCE TO BE SEEN ALTOGETHER HE REMINDED ME FORCIBLY OF A GORILLA AND YET THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY PLEASING AND GENIAL ABOUT THE MAN'S EYE I REMEMBER SAYING THAT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW HIM
TO BEGIN WITH HE WAS SHORTISH RATHER BOW LEGGED VERY DEEP CHESTED AND WITH UNUSUALLY LONG ARMS HE HAD DARK HAIR AND SMALL EYES AND THE HAIR GREW RIGHT DOWN ON HIS FOREHEAD
AND FOUND IT WAS THE LITTLE STAIR DOWN WHICH THE WEAK DAWN WAS STEALING
SOME WERE GHASTLY SOME RECALLED THOUGHTS AND SENSATIONS THAT HAD FOR YEARS BEEN BURIED IN THE DEBRIS OF MY PAST LIFE BUT BEHIND AND ABOVE THEM ALL HOVERED THE SHAPE OF THAT AWFUL WOMAN AND THROUGH THEM GLEAMED THE MEMORY OF HER ENTRANCING LOVELINESS
UP AGAIN AND AGAIN DOWN CURSE HER THE DAUGHTER OF THE NILE BECAUSE OF HER BEAUTY CURSE HER BECAUSE HER MAGIC HATH PREVAILED AGAINST ME CURSE HER
AND NOW SIR I MUST BE SEEING ABOUT MISTER LEO'S BROTH IF THAT WILD CAT WILL LET ME AND PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO GET UP SIR BECAUSE IT'S PAST NINE O'CLOCK JOB'S REMARKS WERE NOT OF AN EXACTLY CHEERING ORDER TO A MAN WHO HAD PASSED SUCH A NIGHT AS I HAD
TO WHAT PURPOSE SHE SAID GLOOMILY OF WHAT GOOD IS IT TO RECALL THE SEMBLANCE OF LIFE WHEN I CANNOT RECALL THE SPIRIT EVEN IF THOU STOODEST BEFORE ME THOU WOULDST NOT KNOW ME AND COULDST BUT DO WHAT I BID THEE THE LIFE IN THEE WOULD BE MY LIFE
NEXT HE LOOKED AT THE POTS FULL OF WATER WHICH CONSTITUTED OUR WASHING APPARATUS
A FACT THAT PROVED TO ME THAT THESE DAIS MUST HAVE BEEN USED AS ALTARS PROBABLY FOR THE CELEBRATION OF RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES AND MORE ESPECIALLY OF RITES CONNECTED WITH THE INTERMENT OF THE DEAD ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS DAIS WERE PASSAGES LEADING BILLALI INFORMED ME TO OTHER CAVES FULL OF DEAD BODIES
WAS AS STRANGE AS ANY I EVER SAW EVEN IN THAT UNHOLY LAND UPON THE GROUND BEFORE THE DAIS WERE STRETCHED SCORES OF THE CORPSELIKE FORMS OF THE SPECTATORS TILL AT LAST THE LONG LINES OF THEM WERE LOST IN THE GLOOMY BACKGROUND
FOR IN THE BOWELS OF THE ROCK IT WOULD BE AS DARK AT MIDDAY AS AT MIDNIGHT I LOOKED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER NOT A SIGHT OR A SOUND I PEERED FORWARD INTO THE DARKNESS SURELY FAR AWAY I SAW SOMETHING LIKE THE FAINT GLOW OF FIRE
AS FOR THEIR SUDDEN ATTACK UPON OURSELVES IT WAS MADE IN AN ACCESS OF SUDDEN FURY AND THEY DEEPLY REGRETTED IT HE ENDED BY HUMBLY PRAYING THAT THEY MIGHT BE BANISHED INTO THE SWAMPS TO LIVE AND DIE AS IT MIGHT CHANCE
AND HAD COME OUT OF THE OLD COFFER THAT VINCEY HAD LEFT IN MY ROOMS NEARLY ONE AND TWENTY YEARS BEFORE COULD IT BE AFTER ALL THAT THE WHOLE STORY WAS TRUE AND THE WRITING ON THE SHERD WAS NOT A FORGERY OR THE INVENTION OF SOME CRACK BRAINED LONG FORGOTTEN INDIVIDUAL
YOU WILL SEE IT STATED IN THIS MANUSCRIPT THAT I OR RATHER WE HAD MADE UP OUR MINDS NOT TO MAKE THIS HISTORY PUBLIC DURING OUR JOINT LIVES NOR SHOULD WE ALTER OUR DETERMINATION WERE IT NOT FOR A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH HAS RECENTLY ARISEN
DID I NOT SEND MY WORD UNTO YOU BY BILLALI MY SERVANT AND THE FATHER OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD DID I NOT BID YOU TO HOSPITABLY ENTERTAIN THESE STRANGERS WHOM NOW YE HAVE STRIVEN TO SLAY AND WHOM HAD NOT THEY BEEN BRAVE AND STRONG BEYOND THE STRENGTH OF MEN
WHICH HE COULD NOT DO BECAUSE THERE WAS NO BRUSH
BUT OH MY DEAR SON BE MORE CAREFUL YESTERDAY I MADE SURE IN MY HEART THAT SHE WOULD BLAST THEE WHEN THOU DIDST NOT CRAWL UPON THY STOMACH BEFORE HER
IT SEEMED THAT THEIR QUEEN SO RARELY APPEARED IN PUBLIC THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO UNDERGO THIS INCONVENIENCE AND EVEN GRAVER RISKS
WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THEIR CLIENT AND MISTER LEO VINCEY HAD ALREADY LEFT THIS COUNTRY FOR THIBET AND THEY DID NOT AT PRESENT KNOW THEIR ADDRESS WELL THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY OF THE HISTORY ITSELF THE READER MUST JUDGE I GIVE IT HIM
SHE SAID WITH A LITTLE LAUGH I TOO HAVE NOT SLEPT WELL LAST NIGHT I HAD DREAMS AND METHINKS THAT THOU DIDST CALL THEM TO ME OH HOLLY OF WHAT DIDST THOU DREAM AYESHA I ASKED INDIFFERENTLY I DREAMED SHE ANSWERED QUICKLY
WAS I MAD OR DRUNK OR DREAMING OR WAS I MERELY THE VICTIM OF A GIGANTIC AND MOST ELABORATE HOAX HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT I A RATIONAL MAN NOT UNACQUAINTED WITH THE LEADING SCIENTIFIC FACTS OF OUR HISTORY
OH WHY COULD I NOT DIE WITH THEE I WHO SLEW THEE ALAS THAT I CANNOT DIE ALAS ALAS AND SHE FLUNG HERSELF PRONE UPON THE GROUND AND SOBBED AND WEPT TILL I THOUGHT HER HEART MUST BURST
GIVING YOU FULL LEAVE TO PUBLISH IT IF YOU THINK FIT THE ONLY STIPULATION BEING THAT YOU SHALL DISGUISE OUR REAL NAMES
AND WHETHER IT WAS MY IMAGINATION OR A FACT I AM UNABLE TO SAY BUT I THOUGHT THAT THE QUIET FORM BENEATH THE COVERING BEGAN TO QUIVER AND THE WINDING SHEET TO LIFT AS THOUGH IT LAY ON THE BREAST OF ONE WHO SLEPT SUDDENLY SHE WITHDREW HER HANDS AND THE MOTION OF THE CORPSE SEEMED TO ME TO CEASE
THIS WAS THE LAST I SAW OR HEARD OF CHARON AND THE GREEK GOD FOR MANY A LONG DAY
I WAS SO INTENSELY INTERESTED IN THE WHOLE WEIRD STORY THAT SO FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHATTERED STATE OF MY NERVES I ASKED NOTHING BETTER EVEN IF MY LIFE PAID FORFEIT TO MY CURIOSITY
HAVING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE OF MY GREEN AND TENDER YOUTH PUT THE SOFTER SEX I SOMETIMES THINK THAT THIS IS A MISNOMER ALMOST ENTIRELY OUT OF MY THOUGHTS BUT NOW TO MY INTENSE HORROR I KNEW THAT I COULD NEVER PUT AWAY THE VISION OF THOSE GLORIOUS EYES
AND AS THEY DID SO SHE SPOKE OR RATHER HISSED IN ARABIC IN A NOTE THAT CURDLED MY BLOOD AND FOR A SECOND STOPPED MY HEART CURSE HER
AND FITFULLY THESE SEEM TO TURN BUT BEHIND THEM EVER BLOWS THE GREAT WIND OF MY PURPOSE NAY THE MEN MUST DIE AND DIE AS I HAVE SAID THEN SUDDENLY TURNING TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD
THEY CALL HIM THE GREEK GOD BUT LOOK AT THE OTHER ONE HE'S VINCEY'S THAT'S THE GOD'S NAME GUARDIAN AND SUPPOSED TO BE FULL OF EVERY KIND OF INFORMATION
AY EVEN IF HE PROVED TO BE THE MAN THEN I WENT BACK AS SOFTLY AS I HAD COME BUT STILL I COULD NOT SLEEP THE SIGHT AND THOUGHT OF DEAR LEO LYING THERE SO ILL HAD BUT ADDED FUEL TO THE FIRE OF MY UNREST
I SAW A CRINGE OF TERROR RUN ALONG THE RANK OF THE DOOMED WRETCHES AND WICKED VILLAINS AS THEY WERE I FELT SORRY FOR THEM SOME MINUTES PERHAPS TWO OR THREE PASSED BEFORE ANYTHING FRESH OCCURRED DURING WHICH SHE APPEARED FROM THE MOVEMENT OF HER HEAD
A FINE BROAD CHESTED FELLOW WELL ON IN MIDDLE LIFE WITH DEEP GRAVEN FEATURES AND AN EYE LIKE A HAWK'S SPOKE AND SAID THAT THE ORDERS THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED WERE NOT TO HARM THE WHITE MEN NOTHING WAS SAID OF THEIR BLACK SERVANT
I WENT AND SAW POOR LEO WHO WAS QUITE OFF HIS HEAD AND DID NOT EVEN KNOW ME I ASKED USTANE HOW SHE THOUGHT HE WAS BUT SHE ONLY SHOOK HER HEAD AND BEGAN TO CRY A LITTLE EVIDENTLY HER HOPES WERE SMALL
AND THEN I LAUGHED AGAIN AT MY OWN FOLLY AND THE SOUND OF MY LAUGHTER RANG DISMALLY ALONG THE VAULTED ROOF AS THOUGH THE GHOST OF THE WARRIOR HAD ECHOED THE GHOST OF A LAUGH NEXT I BETHOUGHT ME THAT I HAD NOT BEEN TO SEE HOW LEO WAS
OR RATHER LIKE THE GLOW FROM SOME UNSEEN LIGHT NEVER HAVE I SEEN HER VEILED SHAPE LOOK MORE TERRIBLE THAN IT DID IN THAT SPACE WHILE SHE GATHERED HERSELF UP FOR VENGEANCE AT LAST IT CAME
THE SHARP DRAUGHT CAUGHT MY LAMP AND EXTINGUISHED IT LEAVING ME IN UTTER DARKNESS IN THE BOWELS OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PLACE I TOOK A COUPLE OF STRIDES FORWARD SO AS TO CLEAR THE BISECTING TUNNEL BEING TERRIBLY AFRAID LEST I SHOULD TURN UP IT IN THE DARK
AT FIRST I WAS INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THIS HISTORY OF A WOMAN ON WHOM CLOTHED IN THE MAJESTY OF HER ALMOST ENDLESS YEARS THE SHADOW OF ETERNITY ITSELF LAY LIKE THE DARK WING OF NIGHT WAS SOME GIGANTIC ALLEGORY OF WHICH I COULD NOT CATCH THE MEANING
I HEARD HIM MURMUR NO HOT WATER IN THIS BEASTLY PLACE I SUPPOSE THESE POOR CREATURES ONLY USE IT TO BOIL EACH OTHER IN AND HE SIGHED DEEPLY WHAT IS THE MATTER JOB I SAID BEG PARDON SIR HE SAID TOUCHING HIS HAIR
AND BEGGED HER TO SPARE THEM OR AT LEAST TO METE OUT THEIR FATE IN SOME LESS AWFUL WAY BUT SHE WAS HARD AS ADAMANT ABOUT IT MY HOLLY SHE SAID AGAIN SPEAKING IN GREEK WHICH TO TELL THE TRUTH ALTHOUGH I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED A BETTER SCHOLAR OF THE LANGUAGE THAN MOST MEN
AS I THINK THE READER WILL BE ALSO AND AT ONCE MADE UP MY MIND TO PRESS ON WITH THE MATTER I WROTE TO THIS EFFECT TO MISTER HOLLY BUT A WEEK AFTERWARDS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THAT GENTLEMAN'S LAWYERS RETURNING MY OWN
AND NOW WHAT AM I TO SAY FURTHER I REALLY DO NOT KNOW
I FEEL IT INCUMBENT ON ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT MY EXACT CONNECTION WITH IT IS AND SO I MAY AS WELL SAY AT ONCE THAT I AM NOT THE NARRATOR BUT ONLY THE EDITOR OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY HISTORY AND THEN GO ON TO TELL HOW IT FOUND ITS WAY INTO MY HANDS
UP AND DOWN THE CAVE I STRODE UP AND DOWN SUDDENLY I OBSERVED WHAT I HAD NOT NOTICED BEFORE THAT THERE WAS A NARROW APERTURE IN THE ROCKY WALL I TOOK UP THE LAMP AND EXAMINED IT THE APERTURE LED TO A PASSAGE
WAS USTANE SHE HELD HIS HAND IN ONE OF HERS BUT SHE TOO WAS DOZING AND THE TWO MADE A PRETTY OR RATHER A PATHETIC PICTURE POOR LEO HIS CHEEK WAS BURNING RED THERE WERE DARK SHADOWS BENEATH HIS EYES AND HIS BREATH CAME HEAVILY
AT ANY RATE TO MY VIEW PARTICULARLY INTERESTING INDEED ONE MIGHT IMAGINE THAT MISTER HOLLY WOULD UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE EASILY OUTSTRIPPED HIM IN THE FAVOUR OF SHE CAN IT BE THAT EXTREMES MEET
WE NEVER ASCERTAINED AND NOW ALAS WE NEVER SHALL AT LEAST NOT YET THESE AND MANY OTHER QUESTIONS ARISE IN MY MIND BUT WHAT IS THE GOOD OF ASKING THEM NOW WILL YOU UNDERTAKE THE TASK
OF THE WOMAN'S EXTRAORDINARY ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE REMOTE PAST AND HER IGNORANCE OR APPARENT IGNORANCE OF ANY SUBSEQUENT HISTORY WHAT TOO OF HER WONDERFUL AND AWFUL LOVELINESS THIS AT ANY RATE WAS A PATENT FACT AND BEYOND THE EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD
AND THEREUPON THE ENTIRE CROWD OF SPECTATORS INSTANTLY PRECIPITATED ITSELF UPON THE GROUND AND LAY STILL AS THOUGH IT WERE INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY STRICKEN DEAD LEAVING ME STANDING THERE LIKE SOME SOLITARY SURVIVOR OF A MASSACRE
THEN ONCE MORE SHE BEGAN HER UNHOLY RITES CURSE HER WHEN SHE SHALL BE BORN AGAIN
AND WELL KNEW THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER GIFT OF LIFE WATERED BY HER WISDOM AND SHONE UPON WITH THE SUNSHINE OF HER PRESENCE IT WOULD BLOOM LIKE A FLOWER AND FLASH OUT LIKE A STAR
BUT I SAW IT WRITTEN ON HIS FACE THAT HE HAD BUT LITTLE HOPE OF MERCY THEN CAME A PAUSE AND THE MOST INTENSE SILENCE REIGNED OVER THE WHOLE SCENE WHICH ILLUMINATED AS IT WAS BY THE FLICKER OF THE LAMPS STRIKING OUT BROAD PATTERNS OF LIGHT AND SHADOW UPON THE ROCKY WALLS
AS IT DID SO A LONG STRING OF GUARDS BEGAN TO DEFILE FROM A PASSAGE TO THE LEFT AND RANGED THEMSELVES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE DAIS THEN FOLLOWED ABOUT A SCORE OF MALE MUTES THEN AS MANY WOMEN MUTES BEARING LAMPS AND THEN A TALL WHITE FIGURE
THEY PROCEEDED TO TRY TO HOT POT HIM AFTER THE ANCIENT AND HONOURABLE CUSTOM OF THEIR COUNTRY
AND THE AWFUL VINDICTIVENESS DISPLAYED UPON THOSE QUIVERING FEATURES AND IN THE TORTURED LOOK OF THE UPTURNED EYES WERE SUCH AS SURPASS MY POWERS OF DESCRIPTION FOR A MOMENT SHE STOOD STILL HER HANDS RAISED HIGH ABOVE HER HEAD AND AS SHE DID SO
FEARING LEST I SHOULD FALL INTO SOME PIT THIRTY PACES THERE WAS A LIGHT A BROAD LIGHT THAT CAME AND WENT SHINING THROUGH CURTAINS FIFTY PACES IT WAS CLOSE AT HAND SIXTY
YE WOULD CRUELLY HAVE MURDERED HATH IT NOT BEEN TAUGHT TO YOU FROM CHILDHOOD THAT THE LAW OF SHE IS AN EVER FIXED LAW AND THAT HE WHO BREAKETH IT BY SO MUCH AS ONE JOT OR TITTLE SHALL PERISH AND IS NOT MY LIGHTEST WORD A LAW
THE NEXT THING THAT I REMEMBER WAS OPENING MY EYES AND PERCEIVING THE FORM OF JOB WHO HAD NOW PRACTICALLY RECOVERED FROM HIS ATTACK OF FEVER HE WAS STANDING IN THE RAY OF LIGHT THAT PIERCED INTO THE CAVE FROM THE OUTER AIR SHAKING OUT MY CLOTHES AS A MAKESHIFT FOR BRUSHING THEM
MY WEARIED BODY AND OVERSTRAINED MIND AWAKENED ALL MY IMAGINATION INTO PRETERNATURAL ACTIVITY IDEAS VISIONS ALMOST INSPIRATIONS FLOATED BEFORE IT WITH STARTLING VIVIDNESS MOST OF THEM WERE GROTESQUE ENOUGH
AY AND MORE THAN HALF OF OUR MISFORTUNES WHY CANNOT MAN BE CONTENT TO LIVE ALONE AND BE HAPPY AND LET THE WOMEN LIVE ALONE AND BE HAPPY TOO BUT PERHAPS THEY WOULD NOT BE HAPPY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT WE SHOULD EITHER HERE IS A NICE STATE OF AFFAIRS
DOGS AND SERPENTS SHE BEGAN IN A LOW VOICE THAT GRADUALLY GATHERED POWER AS SHE WENT ON TILL THE PLACE RANG WITH IT EATERS OF HUMAN FLESH TWO THINGS HAVE YE DONE
BECAUSE SHE HELD MY BELOVED FROM ME AND AGAIN THE FLAME DWINDLED AND SHRANK SHE PUT HER HANDS BEFORE HER EYES AND ABANDONING THE HISSING TONE CRIED ALOUD WHAT IS THE USE OF CURSING SHE PREVAILED
MIDDLE AGED AND HIDEOUS HAVE AGAINST HIS BRIGHT YOUTH AND BEAUTY WELL THANK HEAVEN MY SENSE OF RIGHT WAS NOT DEAD SHE HAD NOT KILLED THAT YET AND AS I STOOD THERE I PRAYED TO HEAVEN IN MY HEART THAT MY BOY MY MORE THAN SON MIGHT LIVE
IN WHOM I RECOGNISED SHE HERSELF SHE MOUNTED THE DAIS AND SAT DOWN UPON THE CHAIR AND SPOKE TO ME IN GREEK I SUPPOSE BECAUSE SHE DID NOT WISH THOSE PRESENT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE SAID COME HITHER OH HOLLY SHE SAID AND SIT THOU AT MY FEET
SO TAKING UP ONE OF THE LAMPS WHICH WAS BURNING AT MY BEDSIDE I SLIPPED OFF MY SHOES AND CREPT DOWN THE PASSAGE TO THE ENTRANCE OF HIS SLEEPING CAVE THE DRAUGHT OF THE NIGHT AIR WAS LIFTING HIS CURTAIN TO AND FRO GENTLY AS THOUGH SPIRIT HANDS WERE DRAWING AND REDRAWING IT
AND THEN PAUSED WHEN SHE SPOKE AGAIN IT WAS IN A KIND OF AWED WHISPER AS THOUGH HER IDEA WERE TERRIBLE EVEN TO HERSELF SHALL I RAISE THEE SHE SAID APPARENTLY ADDRESSING THE CORPSE SO THAT THOU STANDEST THERE BEFORE ME AS OF OLD
GOING AWAY AGAIN THIS TIME TO CENTRAL ASIA WHERE IF ANYWHERE UPON THIS EARTH WISDOM IS TO BE FOUND AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR SOJOURN THERE WILL BE A LONG ONE POSSIBLY WE SHALL NOT RETURN
THE THING WAS CONTRARY TO THE EXPERIENCE OF HUMAN NATURE AND ABSOLUTELY AND UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE IT MUST BE A HOAX AND YET IF IT WERE A HOAX WHAT WAS I TO MAKE OF IT WHAT TOO WAS TO BE SAID OF THE FIGURES ON THE WATER
TO BE BRIEF AND COME TO MY BUSINESS I HAVE RECENTLY READ WITH MUCH INTEREST A BOOK OF YOURS DESCRIBING A CENTRAL AFRICAN ADVENTURE
I FOUND IT RATHER DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW CHIEFLY BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE IN THE FALL OF THE ACCENT AYESHA OF COURSE TALKED WITH THE ACCENT OF HER CONTEMPORARIES WHEREAS WE HAVE ONLY TRADITION AND THE MODERN ACCENT TO GUIDE US AS TO THE EXACT PRONUNCIATION MY HOLLY IT CANNOT BE
FROM THAT MARVELLOUS WOMAN WHO WAS SHE HOW DID SHE FIRST COME TO THE CAVES OF KOR
I HEARD AFTERWARDS THAT HE WAS POPULARLY SUPPOSED TO BE AS MUCH AFRAID OF A WOMAN AS MOST PEOPLE ARE OF A MAD DOG WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR HIS PRECIPITATE RETREAT I CANNOT SAY HOWEVER THAT YOUNG VINCEY SHOWED MUCH AVERSION TO FEMININE SOCIETY ON THIS OCCASION
PERHAPS IT WAS A CAVE WHERE I COULD GET A LIGHT AT ANY RATE IT WAS WORTH INVESTIGATING SLOWLY AND PAINFULLY I CREPT ALONG THE TUNNEL KEEPING MY HAND AGAINST ITS WALL AND FEELING AT EVERY STEP WITH MY FOOT BEFORE I PUT IT DOWN
THEREFORE IT IS NOT BY FORCE IT IS BY TERROR MY EMPIRE IS OF THE IMAGINATION ONCE IN A GENERATION MAYHAP I DO AS I HAVE DONE BUT NOW AND SLAY A SCORE BY TORTURE BELIEVE NOT THAT I WOULD BE CRUEL
HOLLOWED IN THE ROCK BY THE PEOPLE WHO WERE BEFORE NOBODY VISITED THOSE TOMBS NOW HE SAID AND I MUST SAY THAT MY HEART REJOICED WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE OPPORTUNITIES OF ANTIQUARIAN RESEARCH WHICH OPENED OUT BEFORE ME AT LAST WE CAME TO THE HEAD OF THE CAVE
LEO VINCEY AND MYSELF HAVE RECENTLY PASSED THROUGH A REAL AFRICAN ADVENTURE OF A NATURE SO MUCH MORE MARVELLOUS THAN THE ONE WHICH YOU DESCRIBE THAT TO TELL THE TRUTH I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO SUBMIT IT TO YOU LEST YOU SHOULD DISBELIEVE MY TALE
AGAIN THE FLAME FELL AND AGAIN SHE COVERED HER EYES WITH HER HANDS IT IS OF NO USE NO USE SHE WAILED WHO CAN REACH THOSE WHO SLEEP NOT EVEN I CAN REACH THEM
AND I THEN AND THERE MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF IT WERE IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE I WOULD GET SHE TO COME AND SEE HIM SURELY SHE WOULD CURE HIM IF SHE CHOSE AT ANY RATE SHE SAID SHE COULD WHILE I WAS IN THE ROOM BILLALI ENTERED AND ALSO SHOOK HIS HEAD
I LOOKED AND FOUND THE OLDER MAN QUITE AS INTERESTING IN HIS WAY AS THE GLORIFIED SPECIMEN OF HUMANITY AT HIS SIDE HE APPEARED TO BE ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE AND WAS I THINK AS UGLY AS HIS COMPANION WAS HANDSOME
SAT DOWN AT HER FEET HOW HAST THOU SLEPT MY HOLLY SHE ASKED I SLEPT NOT WELL OH AYESHA I ANSWERED WITH PERFECT TRUTH AND WITH AN INWARD FEAR THAT PERHAPS SHE KNEW HOW I HAD PASSED THE HEART OF THE NIGHT SO
HE PLACED IT ON A LEOPARD SKIN ON THE FLOOR AND STOOD BACK A STEP OR TWO TO OBSERVE THE EFFECT IT WAS NOT SATISFACTORY SO HE SHUT UP THE BAG TURNED IT ON END AND HAVING RESTED IT AGAINST THE FOOT OF THE COUCH PLACED THE DRESSING CASE ON IT
IT HAS NOT BEEN DRIVEN THENCE TO THIS HOUR AFTER I HAD DRESSED MYSELF I PASSED INTO THE EATING OR RATHER EMBALMING CHAMBER AND HAD SOME FOOD WHICH WAS AS BEFORE BROUGHT TO ME BY THE GIRL MUTES WHEN I HAD FINISHED
OF ONE I HATE AND ONE I LOVE AND THEN AS THOUGH TO TURN THE CONVERSATION SHE ADDRESSED THE CAPTAIN OF HER GUARD IN ARABIC LET THE MEN BE BROUGHT BEFORE ME THE CAPTAIN BOWED LOW FOR THE GUARD AND HER ATTENDANTS DID NOT PROSTRATE THEMSELVES
A SOUL IN HELL IT WAS NEARLY TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT WHEN I CAST MYSELF DOWN UPON MY BED AND BEGAN TO GATHER MY SCATTERED WITS AND REFLECT UPON WHAT I HAD SEEN AND HEARD BUT THE MORE I REFLECTED THE LESS I COULD MAKE OF IT
INDEED HE ADDED THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN IS FULL OF DEAD AND NEARLY ALL OF THEM ARE PERFECT IN FRONT OF THE DAIS WERE GATHERED A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF BOTH SEXES WHO STOOD STARING ABOUT IN THEIR PECULIAR GLOOMY FASHION
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ASLEEP SIR AND I AM SURE YOU SEEM AS THOUGH YOU WANT IT ONE MIGHT THINK FROM THE LOOK OF YOU THAT YOU HAD BEEN HAVING A NIGHT OF IT I ONLY GROANED BY WAY OF ANSWER I HAD INDEED BEEN HAVING A NIGHT OF IT SUCH AS I HOPE NEVER TO HAVE AGAIN
WHAT MAN FOR WHOM PHYSIOLOGY HAS CHARMS COULD FORBEAR TO STUDY SUCH A CHARACTER AS THAT OF THIS AYESHA WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO PRESENTED ITSELF THE VERY TERROR OF THE PURSUIT ADDED TO ITS FASCINATION AND BESIDES
AND SEE ME DO JUSTICE ON THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE SLAIN THEE FORGIVE ME IF MY GREEK DOTH HALT LIKE A LAME MAN IT IS SO LONG SINCE I HAVE HEARD THE SOUND OF IT THAT MY TONGUE IS STIFF AND WILL NOT BEND RIGHTLY TO THE WORDS I BOWED AND MOUNTING THE DAIS
OH GREAT HEAVEN I WAS AT THE CURTAINS AND THEY DID NOT HANG CLOSE SO I COULD SEE CLEARLY INTO THE LITTLE CAVERN BEYOND THEM
WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE NECESSARY I INTRODUCE THE WORLD TO AYESHA AND THE CAVES OF KOR THE EDITOR P S THERE IS ON CONSIDERATION
LET MY POWER FIND HER EVEN THERE LET HER HEAR ME EVEN THERE LET HER HIDE HERSELF IN THE BLACKNESS LET HER GO DOWN INTO THE PIT OF DESPAIR BECAUSE I SHALL ONE DAY FIND HER
WHICH TOGETHER WITH THE SCARAB THE ROYAL SON OF THE SUN
AND IF SO COULD IT BE THAT LEO WAS THE MAN THAT SHE WAS WAITING FOR THE DEAD MAN WHO WAS TO BE BORN AGAIN IMPOSSIBLE THE WHOLE THING WAS GIBBERISH WHO EVER HEARD OF A MAN BEING BORN AGAIN
HE WILL OBSERVE THAT SO FAR AS WE ARE MADE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM THERE APPEARS TO BE NOTHING IN THE CHARACTER OF LEO VINCEY WHICH IN THE OPINION OF MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO ATTRACT AN INTELLECT SO POWERFUL AS THAT OF AYESHA HE IS NOT EVEN
BUT THEN SHE WAS NOT MODERN
HE WAS VERY VERY ILL AND AGAIN THE HORRIBLE FEAR SEIZED ME THAT HE MIGHT DIE AND I BE LEFT ALONE IN THE WORLD AND YET IF HE LIVED HE WOULD PERHAPS BE MY RIVAL WITH AYESHA EVEN IF HE WERE NOT THE MAN WHAT CHANCE SHOULD I
IT IS NOT SO THOU HAST SEEN HOW IN THE HEAVENS THE LITTLE CLOUDS BLOW THIS WAY AND THAT WITHOUT A CAUSE YET BEHIND THEM IS THE GREAT WIND SWEEPING ON ITS PATH WHITHER IT LISTETH SO IT IS WITH ME OH HOLLY MY MOODS AND CHANGES ARE THE LITTLE CLOUDS
AND I TREMBLED AT THE NAME I MUST LOOK UPON THY FACE AGAIN THOUGH IT BE AGONY IT IS A GENERATION SINCE I LOOKED UPON THEE WHOM I SLEW SLEW WITH MINE OWN HAND
BUT AT LENGTH SHE SEEMED TO WEAR HERSELF OUT AND CEASE SHE SAT HERSELF DOWN UPON THE ROCKY FLOOR SHOOK THE DENSE CLOUD OF HER BEAUTIFUL HAIR OVER HER FACE AND BREAST AND BEGAN TO SOB TERRIBLY IN THE TORTURE OF A HEARTRENDING DESPAIR
AND RUNNING SO FAR AS I COULD JUDGE EXACTLY BENEATH THE GALLERY THAT LED TO THE ENTRANCE OF OUR ROOMS AND ACROSS THE GREAT CENTRAL CAVE I WENT ON DOWN IT IT WAS AS SILENT AS THE GRAVE BUT STILL
HE WILL DIE AT NIGHT HE SAID GOD FORBID MY FATHER I ANSWERED AND TURNED AWAY WITH A HEAVY HEART SHE WHO MUST BE OBEYED COMMANDS THY PRESENCE MY BABOON SAID THE OLD MAN AS SOON AS WE GOT TO THE CURTAIN
THAT MY WARD
HOWEVER THIS MAY BE IT HAS GIVEN ME AN IDEA
AND ALAS THE VERY DIABLERIE OF THE WOMAN WHILST IT HORRIFIED AND REPELLED ATTRACTED IN EVEN A GREATER DEGREE A PERSON WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF TWO THOUSAND YEARS AT HER BACK WITH THE COMMAND OF SUCH TREMENDOUS POWERS
AND YET WITHOUT THEE HAVE NAUGHT WHAT IS THERE THAT I CAN DO WHAT WHAT WHAT AND PERCHANCE SHE PERCHANCE THAT EGYPTIAN DOTH ABIDE WITH THEE WHERE THOU ART AND MOCK MY MEMORY
BUT A MONTH AGO I RECEIVED A LETTER AND TWO PACKETS ONE OF MANUSCRIPT
SUDDENLY AS I WAS TRYING TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHAT TO DO WITH A CONVULSIVE MOVEMENT THAT SOMEHOW GAVE AN IMPRESSION OF DESPAIRING ENERGY THE WOMAN ROSE TO HER FEET AND CAST THE DARK CLOAK FROM HER IT WAS SHE HERSELF
AND THE ALMIGHTY GAVE EAR UNTO HIS PRAYER AND COMMANDED THE ARCHANGEL TO DESCEND TO EARTH AND OPEN TO HIM THE GATE OF THE MEETING PLACE OF THE TWO SEAS SO GABRIEL DESCENDED AND SALUTING BULUKIYA OPENED THE GATE TO HIM SAYING
ONE OF THE SHE CAMELS BROKE AWAY AND RUNNING TO THE GARDEN OF THESE YOUNG MEN'S FATHER WHERE THE TREES SHOWED ABOVE THE WALL PUT FORTH HER LIPS AND BEGAN TO FEED AS IN STALL I RAN TO HER
TO DRIVE HER AWAY WHEN BEHOLD THERE APPEARED AT A BREACH OF THE WALL AN OLD MAN AND GREY WHOSE EYES SPARKLED WITH ANGRY RAY HOLDING IN HIS RIGHT A STONE TO THROW
THAT ABU SUWAYD CONTINUED
SHE HATH LIPS LIKE WINE AND BREASTS LIKE POMEGRANATES TWAIN AND A SHAPE SUPPLE AS A RATTAN CANE HER BODY IS WELL FORMED AND WITH SLOPING SHOULDERS DIGHT SHE HATH A NOSE LIKE THE EDGE OF A SWORD SHINING BRIGHT
FAIR OF FACE AND OF TONGUE FLUENT
AND AZRA'IL THERE HATH APPEARED IN THE EAST A MIGHTY DRAGON WHICH HATH LAID WASTE A THOUSAND CITIES AND DEVOURED THEIR INHABITANTS WHEREFORE ALLAH ALMIGHTY HATH COMMANDED US TO GO TO HIM
THAT THE PREACHER WOMAN THUS PURSUED HER THEME IN THE PRAISE OF FAIR MAIDS SHE HATH TWO LIPS OF CRAMOISY THAN CREAM SMOOTHER AND THAN HONEY SWEETER ADDING AND SHE HATH A BOSOM
AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY SECOND NIGHT SHE SAID
AND AT THE END OF THIS TIME HE ONE DAY COMMANDED THE APE ARMY TO MOUNT AND GO FORTH A HUNTING WITH HIM
THEN THEY FARED ON INLAND AND CEASED NOT FARING TILL THEY CAME TO THE BANKS OF A RIVER ON WHOSE OTHER SIDE ROSE A HIGH MOUNTAIN WHEREON JANSHAH SAW A MULTITUDE OF GHULS SO HE TURNED TO THE APES AND ASKED THEM
QUOTH ABU SUWAYD I AND A COMPANY OF MY FRIENDS ENTERED A GARDEN ONE DAY TO BUY SOMEWHAT OF FRUIT AND WE SAW IN A CORNER AN OLD WOMAN WHO WAS BRIGHT OF FACE BUT HER HEAD HAIR WAS WHITE
WHO WITH JANSHAH REACHED THE BOAT IN SAFETY THEN LAUNCHING HER MADE FOR THE WATER AND SAILED NIGHTS AND DAYS WITHOUT KNOWING WHITHER THEIR SHIP WENT THEY KILLED THE GAZELLE AND LIVED ON HER FLESH TILL THE WINDS DROVE THEM TO A THIRD ISLAND
AND SAID DRAW ME MY HOROSCOPE AND LOOK IF ALLAH WILL GRANT ME A SON TO SUCCEED ME
HE'S EVEN FAIRER THAN THOU KNEWEST HIM
AND A MORE POWERFUL THE KING REJOICED GREATLY IN THIS PREDICTION AND NAMED THE BOY JANSHAH THEN HE DELIVERED HIM TO THE NURSES WET AND DRY WHO REARED HIM EXCELLENTLY WELL TILL HE REACHED HIS FIFTH YEAR
AND PRAISED ALLAH THE MOST HIGHEST THEN JANSHAH ASKED THE APES BY SIGNS WHAT THEY WERE AND TO WHOM THE PALACE BELONGED AND THEY ANSWERED HIM BY SIGNALS KNOW YE
AND THAT FROM THEM THERE IS NO ESCAPE FOR THEE EXCEPT BY THE PASSES THAT RUN EAST AND WEST THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS IF THOU TAKE THE EASTERN PASS THOU WILT FARE THROUGH A COUNTRY SWARMING WITH GHULS AND WILD BEASTS
A PLENTEOUS GETTER OF BROOD BY WHOM THE FEMALES ABUNDANTLY BORE
AND HE WAS SUZERAIN ALSO OVER SEVEN VASSAL PRINCES AND TRIBUTE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM FROM THE BROAD LANDS BETWEEN EAST AND WEST HE WAS JUST AND EQUITABLE IN HIS RULE
WAS SITTING ONE DAY JUDGING THE FOLK AND DOING JUSTICE BETWEEN HIS SUBJECTS ATTENDED BY THE BEST AND WISEST OF HIS COUNSELLORS WHEN THERE CAME UP TO HIM A YOUTH COMELY AND CLEANLY ATTIRED UPON WHOM TWO VERY HANDSOME YOUTHS HAD LAID HOLD
SO I SAT WITH HIM AWHILE WHEN LO UP CAME MY SERVANT WHO SAID TO ME O MY LORD THERE ARE AT OUR DOOR MANY LADEN MULES
LIKEWISE A STOMACH RIGHT SMOOTH FLANKS SOFT AS THE PALM SPATHE AND CREASED WITH FOLDS AND DIMPLES WHICH OVERLAP ONE ANOTHER AND LIBERAL THIGHS WHICH LIKE COLUMNS OF PEARL ARISE
WHEN IT WAS THE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOURTH NIGHT SHE SAID
AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDREDTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING
AND CALL UPON THEE TO PASS JUDGEMENT UPON HIM ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT OF ALLAH THEN OMAR CAST A TERRIBLE LOOK AT THE ACCUSED YOUTH AND SAID TO HIM VERILY THOU HEAREST THE COMPLAINT THESE TWO YOUNG MEN PREFER
AND ALL HIS DAYS WERE GLADNESS MOREOVER HIS FATHER CEASED NOT TO BE HIS CHIEF WAZIR ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND HE TOOK TO HIMSELF ANOTHER WAZIR TO BE AT HIS LEFT HAND HIS REIGN WAS A PROSPEROUS AND WELL ORDERED
A NUMBER OF STOOLS SURROUNDING A THRONE OF RED GOLD STUDDED WITH ALL KINDS OF JEWELS AND ESPECIALLY RUBIES AND SEEING THE BEAUTY OF THE CASTLE AND OF THE GARDEN THEY ENTERED AND EXPLORED IN ALL DIRECTIONS BUT FOUND NO ONE THERE
THERE IS COME UPON ME A SORE MALADY PERADVENTURE A MORTAL AND I HAVE THEREFORE SUMMONED YOU TO CONSULT YOU RESPECTING A CERTAIN MATTER ON WHICH I WOULD HAVE YOU COUNSEL ME AS YOU DEEM WELL THEY ASKED
AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE IN BAGHDAD THERE LIVED ONCE IN THE CITY OF CAIRO A MERCHANT WHO HAD GREAT STORE OF MONIES AND BULLION GEMS AND JEWELS AND LANDS AND HOUSES BEYOND COUNT AND HIS NAME WAS HASAN THE JEWELLER THE BAGHDAD MAN
HASAN FELL SICK AND HIS SICKNESS GREW UPON HIM TILL HE MADE SURE OF DEATH SO HE CALLED HIS SON TO HIM
AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO ENTER THE VALLEY AND HASTENED AFTER THEM WHEN JANSHAH AND HIS MEN SAW THEM THEY FLED INTO THE EMMET VALLEY BUT THE APES SOON OVERTOOK THEM AND WOULD HAVE SLAIN THEM WHEN BEHOLD
AND IT BEFITS NOT TO ADVANCE ME OVER HIM BUT ALI SAID I WILL CONSENT TO NOTHING SAVE WHATSO CONTENTETH MY BRETHREN AND THEY HAVE ALL CHOSEN AND AGREED UPON THEE
BOTH FRESH AND DRY AND FLOWERS OF GRATEFUL ODOUR AND TREES AND BIRDS SINGING UPON THE BOUGHS AMIDDLEMOST THE GARDEN WAS A VAST BASIN OF WATER AND BESIDE IT A GREAT OPEN HALL WITH A RAISED DAIS WHEREON STOOD
NOT LONG AFTER HE SICKENED AND DIED
SO OPEN THY MOUTH THE SERPENT REPLIED DO WHATSO THOU WILT AND OPENED HIS MOUTH AND GOD PLACED HELL INTO HIS MAW SAYING KEEP IT UNTIL THE DAY OF RESURRECTION WHEN THAT TIME COMES
WHEN JANSHAH HEARD THIS HE TURNED TO HIS MAMELUKES AND SAID TO THEM WE HAVE NO MEANS OF ESCAPING FROM THESE APES AND WE MUST PATIENTLY AWAIT THE ORDINANCE OF THE ALMIGHTY
THAT HE WHO WROTE THIS TABLET WAS THE LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE
GO TO YONDER WADY AND CATCH THY SUFFICIENCY OF SERPENTS THAT I MAY BROIL OF THEM FOR THEE AND GIVE THEE TO EAT REJOINED THE PILGRIM I DARE NOT CATCH SERPENTS NOR DID I EVER EAT THEM
JANSHAH AND HIS MEN CEASED NOT DRIVING BEFORE THE WIND AND THOSE IN SEARCH OF THEM CRUISED ABOUT FOR TEN DAYS
AND IN AGES LONG GONE BEFORE A VIRTUOUS WOMAN AMONG THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WHO WAS PIOUS AND DEVOUT AND USED EVERY DAY TO GO OUT TO THE PLACE OF PRAYER
AND ALL HER TIME BAWD OR ADULTERESS IS AND A TALE IS RELATED
HE WEPT SORE AND REPEATED THEM TO HIS MEN THEN THEY MOUNTED AGAIN AND SURROUNDED BY THE ARMY OF THE APES WHO WERE REJOICING IN THEIR VICTORY RETURNED TO THE CASTLE
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SECOND NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE PRINCE SET THEM ASHORE AND THEY SEARCHED THE ISLAND EAST AND WEST BUT FOUND NO ONE
QUOTH I NAY BY MY LIFE OF HIM'S SHAYBAN HOW MANY A SIRE ROSE HIGH BY A NOBLE SON AS ALLAH'S PROPHET
AND BADE THEM LOOSE HIM THEN CALLING HIM NEAR TO HIMSELF ASKED THE TWAIN WHAT IS YOUR CASE WITH HIM THEY ANSWERED O PRINCE OF TRUE BELIEVERS WE ARE TWO BROTHERS BY ONE MOTHER
WITH LIGHT SHINING FROM HIS VISAGE SITTING WEEPING AND LAMENTING BETWEEN TWO BUILT TOMBS SO HE SALUTED HIM AND HE RETURNED HIS SALUTATION AND BULUKIYA SAID TO HIM WHO ART THOU
ALLAH GIVE THEE HIS AID AND RENDER THEE BY HIS BOUNTIES INDEPENDENT OF HIS CREATURES AND VOUCHSAFE THEE ABUNDANT WEAL AND BESTOW ON THEE WHAT SHALL SUFFICE THEE WITHOUT THE NEED OF ANY BUT HIMSELF
IN HER ALL BEAUTIES TO CONCLUSION COME AND SHE IS THE CENTRE OF ATTRACTION TO TRAVELLER AND STAY AT HOME SHE HATH TWO LIPS OF CRAMOISY THAN CREAM SMOOTHER AND OF TASTE THAN HONEY SWEETER
AND HE CEASED NOT FOLLOWING THEM TO THE PLACE OF EXECUTION TILL HE CAME UP WITH THEM AND SAID TO THEM HASTEN NOT TO STONE HER TILL I JUDGE BETWEEN THEM
OPEN TO ME THE GATE THAT I MAY SEE THAT WHICH IS THEREIN QUOTH THEY WE CANNOT AND NONE MAY OPEN THIS GATE OF ALL CREATED BEINGS SAVE GABRIEL THE FAITHFUL ONE WITH WHOM BE PEACE
AND WHAT ARE THESE TWO BUILT TOMBS BETWEEN WHICH THOU SITTEST AND WHEREFORE THIS WAILING HE LOOKED AT HIM AND WEPT WITH SORE WEEPING TILL HE DRENCHED HIS CLOTHES WITH HIS TEARS THEN SAID
THEN RAISED IT AND LOOKING ROUND UPON THOSE PRESENT SAID WHO WILL STAND SURETY
AND SHROUDED AND BURIED HIM AND HELD OVER HIM READINGS AND PERLECTIONS OF THE KORAN TO THE END OF THE CUSTOMARY FORTY DAYS AND KING HASAN SON OF THE WAZIR REIGNED IN HIS STEAD AND HIS SUBJECTS JOYED IN HIM
AND KING HASAN REPLIED I HEAR AND OBEY NOW AFTER THIS THE OLD KING LINGERED THREE DAYS AND THEN DEPARTED INTO THE MERCY OF ALMIGHTY ALLAH SO THEY LAID HIM OUT
SO I WOULD HAVE YOU ALL AGREE UPON SOME ONE THAT I MAY PROCLAIM HIM KING IN MY LIFETIME AND SO YE MAY BE AT EASE WHEREUPON QUOTH THEY WITH ONE VOICE WE ALL APPROVE OF THY DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND HASAN
SO HE LANDED AND ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE PALACE WHICH HE ENTERED MARVELLING AT THE GOODLINESS OF THE PLACE THEY THEN VISITED EVERY PART OF THE GARDENS AND ATE OF THE FRUITS AND CONTINUED WALKING TILL IT WAXED DARK
WHAT MEANS THIS PINE FOR HIM SEEST NOT THE FLOWING HAIR ON CHEEKS A FLOWING I SAY BY ALLAH AN YE DEEM I DOTE LOOK AT THE TRUTH IN THOSE FINE EYES A SHOWING
THEN THE WAZIRS APPROACHED AND EXHORTED HIM BY SIGNS TO DO JUSTICE AMONGST THEM AND RULE THEM RIGHTEOUSLY AFTER WHICH THE APES CRIED OUT TO ONE ANOTHER AND WENT AWAY
TO REFRESH HIMSELF AMONGST ITS TREES AND PLUCK THE RIPE FRUITS WHEN THIS YOUNG MAN SLEW HIM WRONGOUSLY AND SWERVED FROM THE ROAD OF RIGHTEOUSNESS WHEREFORE WE DEMAND OF THEE THE RETRIBUTION OF HIS CRIME
HE MOUNTED THE PULPIT FOR HE WAS ELOQUENT AND EVER READY OF SPEECH AND SAID O FOLK ALLAH ALMIGHTY HATH MADE ME RULER OVER YOU BY REASON OF YOUR FROWARDNESS
BE SEATED O MY SON HE SAT DOWN AND THE KING CONTINUED
SO HE ENTERED AND GABRIEL LOCKED THE GATE BEHIND HIM AND FLEW BACK TO HEAVEN WHEN BULUKIYA FOUND HIMSELF WITHIN THE GATE HE LOOKED AND BEHELD A VAST OCEAN HALF SALT AND HALF FRESH
FASTING BY DAY AND PRAYING THROUGH THE NIGHT MOREOVER HE VOWED MANY VOWS TO THE LIVING THE ETERNAL AND VISITED THE PIOUS AND WAS CONSTANT IN SUPPLICATION
THAT E E N BY DAY LIGHT SHOWS THE DUNG UPON THEIR DRESS WHAT CONTRAST WI THE MAN WHO SLEPT A GLADSOME NIGHT
AND IT IS MY PURPOSE TO PROCLAIM THEE WHILST I YET LIVE AND SO MAKE AN END OF THE BUSINESS BUT HASAN STOOD UP AND KISSING THE GROUND ONCE MORE BEFORE THE KING SAID TO HIM
OUR FATHER WAS A MAN HONOURED BY THE TRIBES SOUND OF BASENESS AND RENOWNED FOR GOODLINESS WHO REARED US DELICATELY IN CHILDHOOD AND LOADED US WITH FAVOURS IN MANHOOD IN FINE A SEA OF NOBLE AND ILLUSTRIOUS QUALITIES
AND UPROOTETH YOU STOCK AND BRANCH REPLIED THE MAN INDEED THAT MAY BE
SEEING THAT ALLAH EXTOLLED AND EXALTED BE HE HATH PROMISED HIS PROPHETS AND SAINTS BLACK EYED DAMSELS IN PARADISE
SO AFTER RUMMAGING THE CASTLE THEY RETURNED TO JANSHAH AND TOLD HIM WHAT THEY HAD SEEN WHEN HE HEARD THEIR REPORT HE CRIED NEEDS MUST I SOLACE MYSELF WITH A SIGHT OF IT
WHERE HE ABODE IN SORE CONCERN AS FOR JANSHAH'S MOTHER WHEN SHE HEARD OF HIS LOSS SHE BUFFETED HER FACE AND BEGAN THE MOURNING CEREMONIES FOR HER SON MAKING SURE THAT HE WAS DEAD MEANWHILE
RISE COME WITH US TO THE KING WHEREFORE ASKED HE AND THEY ANSWERED FOR A THING THAT WILL BENEFIT BOTH US AND THEE SO HE WENT IN WITH THEM TO THE KING AND KISSED THE GROUND BEFORE HIS FATHER IN LAW WHO SAID TO HIM
WITH TYRANNY AND OPPRESSION ARE BUT A SEARCHING POISON WHILE OUR COARSE MEAT WHICH IN FREEDOM AND SAFETY WE EAT
TILL EVIL TIMES MY TRIBE BEFEL WHEN I CAME TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS TOWN WITH MY FAMILY AND WHATSO GOODS I OWN AND AS I WENT ALONG ONE OF THE PATHS LEADING TO ITS GARDENS ORCHARDS AND GARTHS
WHAT HAST THOU IN REPLY TO AVER BUT HE WAS BRAVE OF HEART AND BOLD OF SPEECH HAVING DOFFED THE ROBE OF PUSILLANIMITY AND PUT OFF THE GARB OF COWARDRY SO HE SMILED
SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT THE QUEEN CONTINUED WHEN BULUKIYA ENDED HIS RECOUNT THE YOUTH SAID HOW FEW THINGS OF MARVEL HAST THOU SEEN IN THY LIFE O UNHAPPY
THIS IS A THING WHICH MAY NOT BE NOR WILL I BELIEVE THEE UPON THINE OATH WHEN HE HEARD THIS HE WEPT AND ALL THE SERPENTS WEPT ON HIS ACCOUNT AND TOOK TO INTERCEDING FOR HIM WITH THEIR QUEEN SAYING
FOR WHISKERS CHANGE THE CHARMS OF THE COMELY INTO UGLINESS QUOTING THESE COUPLETS THAT SPROUTING HAIR UPON HIS FACE TOOK WREAK
WITH GREAT STORE OF BRIDAL GEAR AND I HAVE APPOINTED HIM TO STAND IN MY STEAD AND TO ENTER INTO THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT IN MY NAME FURTHERMORE I DESIRE THAT OF THY FAVOUR THOU WILT GRANT HIM HIS REQUEST
KNOW O KING THAT WHEN THOU CAMEST TO OUR ISLAND WE KENNED THAT THOU WOULDST BE SULTAN OVER US AND WE FEARED LEST YE ALL FLEE FROM US IN OUR ABSENCE AND EMBARK IN THE BOAT SO WE SANK IT
QUOTH SHE ALLAH WILL PRESERVE ME FROM YOUR FROWARDNESS THEN THEY OPENED THE GARDEN GATE AND CRIED OUT AND THE FOLK CAME TO THEM FROM ALL PLACES SAYING WHAT AILETH YOU QUOTH THEY
BUT THOU WHENCE COMEST THOU AND WHITHER ART THOU BOUND SO HE TOLD THEM HIS STORY AND ASKED THEM OF THE ROAD THEY BADE HIM TRAVERSE THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM
THE WHOLE OF IT AND ALLAH ALONE KNOWETH WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME AFTER THIS WHEN THE YOUTH HEARD HIS STORY HE SIGHED AND SAID O THOU UNHAPPY HOW FEW THINGS THOU HAST SEEN IN THY LIFE COMPARED WITH MINE
EVEN TO THY SON'S SON OF MONIES AND MANSIONS
AND HASTENING TO MY HOUSE FOUND AT THE DOOR A MAN WHO GAVE ME A NOTE WHEREIN WAS WRITTEN THE FOLLOWING AFTER THOU HADST BEEN WITH US AND WE HEARD THY CASE
QUOTH ABU AL AYNA THERE WERE IN OUR STREET TWO WOMEN ONE OF WHOM HAD FOR LOVER A MAN
AND HIS CHEEKS WERE RED AND FLOWER WHITE WAS HIS FOREHEAD AND HIS SIDE FACE WAXED BROWN WITH TENDER DOWN EVEN AS SAITH ONE DESCRIBING HIM THE SPRING OF THE DOWN ON CHEEKS RIGHT CLEARLY SHOWS
A MAN OF THE PILGRIMS ONCE SLEPT A LONG SLEEP AND AWAKING FOUND NO TRACE OF THE CARAVAN SO HE ROSE UP AND WALKED ON
THAT MY SIRE WAS A KING CALLED TEGHMUS WHO REIGNED OVER THE LAND OF KABUL AND THE BANU SHAHLAN TEN THOUSAND WARLIKE CHIEFS EACH RULING OVER AN HUNDRED WALLED CITIES AND A HUNDRED CITADELS
JANSHAH AND HIS FOLLOWERS DISMOUNTED AND BOARDING THE BOAT MADE PRIZE OF THE GAZELLE AND WERE MINDED TO RETURN TO SHORE WITH HER
AND NOTIFIED TO HIM THAT HIS DESIRE HAD BEEN FULFILLED AND THE WAZIR ABODE WITH HIM TWO MONTHS AT THE END OF WHICH TIME HE SAID TO HIM WE BESEECH THEE TO BESTOW UPON US THAT WHEREFORE WE CAME
AND THE MAN WAS SLAIN OF THAT WHEREWITH HE SLEW WHEN THE STONE STRUCK HIM HE CRIED OUT WITH A GREAT CRY AND SHRIEKED OUT A TERRIBLE SHRIEK WHEREUPON I HASTENED FROM THE SPOT
BUT FOR THE DOWN THAT VEILS HIS CHEEK AND CHIN HIS BROW HAD DAZED ALL EYES NO SIGHT ALLOWING AND WHOSO SOJOURNS IN A GROWTHLESS LAND HOW SHALL HE MOVE FROM LAND FAIR GROWTHS A GROWING
KNOW O BULUKIYA THAT UNLIKE THYSELF I HAVE LOOKED UPON OUR LORD SOLOMON IN HIS LIFE AND HAVE SEEN THINGS PAST COUNT OR RECKONING INDEED MY STORY IS STRANGE AND MY CASE OUT OF RANGE
THEN THEY AGAIN EMBARKED AND TAKING WITH THEM THE GAZELLE SET OUT TO RETURN HOMEWARD BUT THE MURK OF EVENING OVERTOOK THEM
WHEN IT WAS THE FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING
BUT A COMPANY OF THEM CAME UP TO THE THRONE WHEREON HE SAT AND KISSING THE EARTH BEFORE HIM STOOD AWHILE IN HIS PRESENCE WITH THEIR PAWS UPON THEIR BREASTS IN POSTURE OF RESPECT
LOOK THOU RULE THE LIEGES IN THE FEAR OF ALLAH
AFTER WHICH SHE BADE A SERPENT CARRY HIM FORTH TO THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THE SERPENT MADE READY
WITH MY SHE CAMELS HIGHLY ESTEEMED AND BY ME MOST PRECIOUS DEEMED
I FELT LIVE COALS OF ANGER KINDLED IN MY HEART SO I TOOK UP THE VERY SAME STONE AND THROWING IT AT THE OLD MAN IT WAS THE CAUSE OF HIS BANE AND BAN THUS
SOME RIDING ON DOGS AND OTHERS AFOOT TILL THEY CAME TO THE SEA SHORE JANSHAH LOOKED FOR THE BOAT WHICH BROUGHT HIM AND FINDING IT SCUTTLED TURNED TO THE WAZIRS
THEN BULUKIYA LIFTED UP HIS VOICE IN SUPPLICATION TO ALLAH SAYING O LORD SEND ME THY MESSENGER GABRIEL THE FAITHFUL ONE
I WILL APPOINT SOME GUARDIAN TO ADMINISTER THE AFFAIRS OF THE BOY AND RETURN TO ANSWER MY DEBT AND I HAVE ONE WHO WILL BE MY SURETY FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS MY PROMISE SO THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL BOWED HIS HEAD AWHILE
HE IS CONSOLED AND LIE NO CONSOLATION COMES TO THOSE WHO PINE AND SIGH I HAD NO SOLACE WHEN ROSE BLOOMED ALONE ON CHEEK
SO O MISERABLE WHERE ARE MORTAL MEN BESIDE THE JINN
AND LET THEM LIE IN THE WIND THREE MONTHS THEN PLACE THEM THREE MONTHS IN A MORTAR WITHOUT A BOTTOM
SO WE WENT OUR WAY REJOICING IN THAT WE HAD PROFITED BY HER CONTENTION AND YET SORROWING TO PART FROM HER AND AMONG THE TALES THEY TELL IS ONE OF ABU SUWAYD AND THE PRETTY OLD WOMAN
AND WAS STARTLED AT THE VASTNESS OF THEIR BULK AND THE STRANGENESS OF THEIR SEMBLANCE FOR SOME OF THEM HAD HEADS LIKE BULLS AND OTHERS LIKE CAMELS
AND HE REPLIED AT THY SERVICE O MY LORD QUOTH THE OLD KING MINE APPOINTED HOUR IS AT HAND BE THOU CAREFUL OF THY WIFE AND HER MOTHER
AND THE GLORY BE TO HIM WHO IS ETERNAL AND IN WHOSE HAND ARE ANNULLING AND CONFIRMING AND OF THE TALES THEY TELL IS ONE OF THE PILGRIM MAN AND THE OLD WOMAN
AND SWAYING TO AND FRO WITH A SWING LIKE A LION READY FOR A SPRING HE CAST THE STONE AT MY STALLION AND IT KILLED HIM FOR IT STRUCK A VITAL PART WHEN I SAW THE STALLION DROP DEAD BESIDE ME
HERE HE BADE THEM DISMOUNT AND THEY ALL ABODE THERE EATING AND DRINKING A SPACE OF TEN DAYS AFTER WHICH JANSHAH TOOK HIS MEN APART ONE NIGHT AND SAID I PURPOSE WE FLEE THROUGH THE VALLEY OF EMMETS
QUESTIONED THEM OF THE SEA AND THE MOUNTAINS REPLIED THEY THIS PLACE IS SITUATE UNDER THE ARSH OR EMPYREAL HEAVEN AND THIS OCEAN CAUSETH THE FLUX AND FLOW
BULUKIYA WONDERED AND ASKED THEM WHAT IS WITHIN THE GATE AND THEY ANSWERED WE WOT NOT THEN QUOTH HE I CONJURE YOU BY THE TRUTH OF YOUR GLORIOUS LORD
AND RUSHED ON JANSHAH AND HIS MAMELUKES TO EAT THEM WHEN THE VOYAGERS SAW THIS THEY TURNED AND FLED SEAWARDS BUT THE CANNIBALS PURSUED THEM AND CAUGHT AND ATE THREE OF THE SLAVES LEAVING ONLY THREE SLAVES
AND AFTER TRITURATION SET THEM IN A CLEFT PLATTER AND LET IT STAND IN THE WIND OTHER THREE MONTHS AFTER WHICH USE OF THIS MEDICINE THREE DRACHMS EVERY NIGHT IN THY SLEEP AND INSHALLAH
AND WHILE EXPLORING THE SAID MOUNTAIN JANSHAH FOUND A TABLET OF ALABASTER WHEREON WAS WRITTEN O THOU WHO ENTEREST THIS LAND KNOW THAT THOU WILT BECOME SULTAN OVER THESE APES
MADE SIGNS TO JANSHAH AND HIS MEN TO EAT THE PRINCE AND HIS FOLLOWERS CAME DOWN FROM THEIR SEATS AND ATE AND THE APES ATE WITH THEM TILL THEY WERE SATISFIED WHEN THE APES TOOK AWAY THE MEAT AND SET ON FRUITS OF WHICH THEY PARTOOK
IN MY COUNTRY ARE HOUSES WIDE AND SPACIOUS AND FRUITS RIPE AND DELICIOUS
AND THEY TELL US THAT WE SHALL HAVE BOON OF A BOY CHILD AND THAT BY NONE OTHER THAN THY DAUGHTER
THAT WHEN KING HASAN WAS QUIT OF THE DIVAN
TILL HE BECAME PROFICIENT IN ALL MANNER OF KNOWLEDGE HE WAS UNDER HIS FATHER'S HAND IN TRADE
WHO WAS EQUAL TO A THOUSAND CAVALIERS IN BATTLE
HEARING THIS TEGHMUS JOYED WITH EXCEEDING JOY AND BESTOWING ON THE ASTROLOGERS AND WIZARDS TREASURE BEYOND NUMBERING OR RECKONING DISMISSED THEM HIS CHIEF WAZIR
AND SPREAD THE STREETS WITH CARPETS THEN HE EQUIPPED HIS DAUGHTER FOR THE JOURNEY AND GAVE HER ALL MANNER OF PRESENTS AND RARITIES
WHAT IS THE MATTER OF WHICH THOU WOULDST TAKE COUNSEL WITH US O KING AND HE ANSWERED I AM OLD AND SICKLY AND I FEAR FOR THE REALM AFTER ME FROM ITS ENEMIES
AND SAID TO HIM MAY NO ILL BEFAL THEE AT THIS THE OLD KING OPENED HIS EYES AND SAID
REPLIED SHE ALL THIS HAVE I HEARD BUT TELL ME HAVE YE A SULTAN WHO RULETH OVER YOU AND IS TYRANNICAL IN HIS RULE AND UNDER WHOSE HAND YOU ARE ONE WHO IF ANY OF YOU COMMIT AN OFFENCE TAKETH HIS GOODS AND RUINETH HIM
BUT THE CONTRARY BOYS ARE LIKENED TO GIRLS FOR FOLK SAY
FOR WHATSO HE WILLETH THAT HE CAN AND HE IS GRACIOUS WITH HIS SERVANTS AND KNOWETH THEIR WANTS SO I WENT OUT FROM THE TWAIN AND RETURNED TO ABDALLAH WITH STRAITENED BREAST
AND WITH THEM A MAN WHO SAYS HE IS THE AGENT OF AL FAZL AND JA'AFAR BIN YAHYA QUOTH ABDALLAH I TRUST THAT RELIEF IS COME TO THEE RISE UP AND GO SEE WHAT IS THE MATTER SO I LEFT HIM
THAT THIS ISLAND BELONGED OF YORE TO OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH OF WHOM BE PEACE AND HE USED TO COME HITHER ONCE EVERY YEAR FOR HIS SOLACE AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY
AND SEIZE HIM AND CAST HIM INTO JAHANNAM BULUKIYA MARVELLED AT THE VASTNESS OF THEIR STATURE AND FARED ON AS BEFORE DAYS AND NIGHTS TILL HE CAME TO AN ISLAND WHERE HE LANDED AND WALKED ABOUT FOR A WHILE
QUOTH HE I AM OF THE SONS OF ADAM A WANDERER FOR THE LOVE OF MOHAMMED WHOM ALLAH ASSAIN AND SAVE AND I HAVE STRAYED FROM MY WAY THEN HE ASKED THEM WHAT THEY WERE AND WHAT WAS THE GATE BEFORE WHICH THEY SAT
AND I WOULD HAVE THEE ABIDE WITH ME TILL I TELL THEE MY HISTORY AND ACQUAINT THEE HOW I COME TO BE SITTING HERE HEARING THIS MUCH HASIB AGAIN INTERRUPTED THE QUEEN OF THE SERPENTS AND SAID TO HER
AND THE ANGEL AND HIS BURDEN WITHOUT SENSING IT WHEN ALLAH CREATED THIS SERPENT HE SAID TO IT BY INSPIRATION
TO BAGHDAD THEN JA'AFAR ENQUIRED AND WHAT WILT THOU DO THERE AND THE OLD MAN REPLIED I GO TO SEEK MEDICINE FOR MY EYE
AND FARED ON FROM PLACE TO PLACE TILL THEY APPROACHED THE WADY OF EMMETS
AND ALL HEARTS ARE RAVISHED BY THE DAINTINESS OF HER SPRITE WHEN SHE SMILETH THOU WOULDST WEEN THE MOON SHONE OUT HER LIPS BETWEEN AND WHEN SHE EYES THEE SWORD BLADES FLASH FROM THE BABES OF HER EYES
WHERE UPON HE SHED TEARS IN FLOODS AND RECITED THESE TWO COUPLETS OLD HAG OF HIGH DEGREE IN FILTHY LIFE WHOSE FACE HER MONSTROUS LEWDNESS WITNESSES WHEN MENSTUOUS SHE BAWDS WHEN CLEAN SHE WHORES
SO THEY MADE THEIR CALCULATIONS AND FOUND THEM FAVOURABLE BUT THAT HE WOULD IN HIS FIFTEENTH YEAR BE EXPOSED TO PERILS AND HARDSHIPS AND THAT IF HE SURVIVED HE WOULD BE HAPPY AND FORTUNATE AND BECOME A GREATER KING THAN HIS FATHER
ACQUIT ME THEREFORE OF THIS THING BUT ALL THE EMIRS CRIED OUT SAYING WE CONSENT NOT BUT THAT THOU BE KING OVER US THEN SAID HASAN MY FATHER IS OLDER THAN I AND I AND HE ARE ONE THING
DOST THOU NOT SEE THAT THE GROWTH UPON HIS CHEEK IS VIOLET BLOOM THAT FROM ITS LEAVES OUTGROWS HE ABODE AWHILE IN EASE AND HAPPINESS WITH HIS FATHER WHO REJOICED AND DELIGHTED IN HIM TILL HE CAME TO MAN'S ESTATE
O MY SON THE APPOINTED TERM DRAWETH NEAR MY HOUR OF DEATH IS AT HAND AND IT REMAINETH BUT TO MEET ALLAH TO WHOM BELONG MAJESTY AND MIGHT I LEAVE THEE WHAT SHALL SUFFICE THEE
RETURNETH THE BOY'S LEMAN WAS EDIFIED BY HER SPEECH AND SAID I FORSWEAR MY LOVER BY THE LORD OF THE KA'ABAH AND AMONGST TALES IS ONE OF ALI THE CAIRENE
THAT THE WOMAN BROUGHT OUT THE FISH ALIVE FROM THE WATER JAR AND ASSEMBLED THE FOLK AGAINST HER HUSBAND AND TOLD THEM HER TALE HE ALSO TOLD HIS BUT THEY CREDITED HIM NOT AND SAID
AND JA'AFAR ANSWERED TAKE THREE OUNCES OF WIND BREATHS AND THE LIKE OF SUNBEAMS AND THE SAME OF MOONSHINE AND AS MUCH OF LAMP LIGHT MIX THEM WELL TOGETHER
THAT WHEN THE PALMER MAN DRANK THE BITTER DRAUGHT FOR STRESS OF THIRST HE RETURNED AND SAID I MARVEL O ANCIENT DAME AT THY CHOOSING TO SOJOURN IN THIS PLACE AND THY PUTTING UP WITH SUCH MEAT AND DRINK SHE ASKED AND HOW IS IT THEN IN THY COUNTRY
ALL SAVE A SMALL PARTY WHICH REMAINED IN PRESENCE TO SERVE HIM AFTER AWHILE THERE CAME UP A COMPANY OF APES WITH HUGE DOGS IN THE SEMBLANCE OF HORSES EACH WEARING ABOUT HIS HEAD A MASSIVE CHAIN
THAT WHEN THE PREACHER WOMAN ENDED HER VERSE SHE RESUMED ADDRESSING THE MAN LAUD TO ALLAH ALMIGHTY HOW CAN IT BE HID FROM THEE THAT THE PERFECT PLEASURE IS IN WOMEN AND THAT ABIDING BLESSINGS ARE NOT TO BE FOUND BUT WITH THEM
AND INFORMED HIM THAT ILL CONDITION HAD REDUCED THEE TO THE HUMILIATION OF BEGGING WHERE UPON HE ORDERED US TO SUPPLY THEE WITH A THOUSAND THOUSAND DIRHAMS FROM THE TREASURY WE REPRESENTED TO HIM
KNOW THOU O MY BROTHER
SO THAT THOU HAST NOW THREE THOUSAND THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DIRHAMS WHEREWITHAL TO ORDER AND AMEND THINE ESTATE SEE THEN THE MUNIFICENCE OF THESE MAGNIFICOS
THEN THEY FARED ON INLAND TO THE HEART THEREOF TILL THEY CAME TO A CASTLE COMPASSED ABOUT WITH RAMPARTS OF WHITE MARBLE WITHIN WHICH WAS A PALACE OF THE CLEAREST CRYSTAL
AND ON THEM FOR DELIGHT DEPEND VERILY THEY MAY SAY WE RULE OVER NECKS AND ROB HEARTS THESE WOMEN HOW MANY A RICH MAN HAVE THEY NOT PAUPERED HOW MANY A POWERFUL MAN HAVE THEY NOT PROSTRATED
SO WE MAY DEPART TO OUR OWN LAND I HEAR AND OBEY ANSWERED THE KING
WHICH WAS FULL OF TREES AND WATERS AND FLOWER GARDENS AND ORCHARDS LADEN WITH ALL FASHION OF FRUITS AND STREAMS STRAYED UNDER THE TREE SHADE BRIEF THE PLACE WAS A GARDEN OF EDEN
AND BACK PARTS WHICH BILLOW AND BEAT TOGETHER LIKE SEAS OF GLASS OR MOUNTAINS OF GLANCE
HERE THE SERPENT QUEEN AGAIN BROKE OFF HER RECITAL SAYING
AND A FOREHEAD BRILLIANT WHITE AND EYEBROWS WHICH UNITE AND EYES STAINED BY NATURE'S HAND BLACK AS NIGHT IF SHE SPEAK FRESH YOUNG PEARLS ARE SCATTERED FROM HER MOUTH FORTHRIGHT
BUT LOST HIS WAY AND PRESENTLY CAME TO A TENT WHERE HE SAW AN OLD WOMAN STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE AND BY HER SIDE A DOG ASLEEP HE WENT UP TO THE TENT AND SALUTING THE OLD WOMAN SOUGHT OF HER FOOD WHEN SHE REPLIED
WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY FOR IT IS MY OWN AND ALL GRACIOUSNESS THOU SHOWEST HIM I TAKE FOR MYSELF BUT BEWARE OF CROSSING ME IN THIS FOR KNOW O KING BAHRWAN
THUS IT IS TOLD IN HISTORY THAT ONE DAY THERE WAS SENT TO AL HAJJAJ BIN YUSUF A SLIP OF PAPER WHEREON WAS WRITTEN FEAR ALLAH AND OPPRESS NOT HIS SERVANTS WITH ALL MANNER OF OPPRESSION WHEN HE READ THIS
AND DEMAND FOR ME THE HAND OF ITS KING BAHRWAN'S DAUGHTER
WHEREUPON THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL OMAR LOOKED AT HIM
AND AGAIN
SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN JA'AFAR ASKED THE MAN WHENCE COMEST THOU HE ANSWERED FROM BASSORAH QUOTH JA'AFAR AND WHITHER GOEST THOU QUOTH THE OTHER
HAVE THEY NOT ENSLAVED INDEED THEY SEDUCE THE SAGE AND SEND THE SAINT TO SHAME AND BRING THE WEALTHY TO WANT AND PLUNGE THE FORTUNE FAVOURED INTO PENURY YET FOR ALL THIS
AFTER WHICH THEY SAID TO HIM KNOW O KING THAT THOU SHALT BE BLESSED WITH A SON
AND A TALE IS TOLD OF THE WOMAN'S TRICK AGAINST HER HUSBAND A MAN BROUGHT HIS WIFE A FISH ONE FRIDAY AND BIDDING HER TO COOK IT AGAINST THE END OF THE CONGREGATIONAL PRAYERS WENT OUT TO HIS CRAFT AND BUSINESS MEANWHILE
TWO OLD MEN ITS KEEPERS AND BOTH SHAYKHS FELL IN LOVE WITH HER AND SOUGHT HER FAVOURS BUT SHE REFUSED WHEREUPON SAID THEY UNLESS THOU YIELD THY BODY TO US WE WILL BEAR WITNESS AGAINST THEE OF FORNICATION
COMPARETH THE BEARDLESS WITH THE BLACK EYED GIRLS OF PARADISE NOW DOUBTLESS THE SUBJECT OF COMPARISON IS WORTHIER THAN THE OBJECT THERE WITH COMPARED SO UNLESS WOMEN BE THE WORTHIER AND THE GOODLIER
SON OF THE WAZIR ALI FOR WE HAVE SEEN HIS WIT AND PERFECT UNDERSTANDING AND HE KNOWETH THE PLACE OF ALL GREAT AND SMALL ASKED THE KING ARE YE INDEED AGREED UPON THIS AND THEY ANSWERED YES
YOU MUST ALL LAND AND EXPLORE THE PLACE WHILE I ABIDE IN THE BOAT SO HE SET THEM ASHORE AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
AND WHAT DID JANSHAH DO WITH THE APES SO THE QUEEN RESUMED HER TALE
WORTHY OF THE POET'S PRAISE
THAT THE KING AND THE WAZIR AND HIS SON CEASED NOT TO DWELL IN ALL SOLACE AND IN THE GREATEST HAPPINESS AWHILE TILL THE KING FELL ILL AND HIS SICKNESS GREW ON HIM SO HE SUMMONED THE LORDS OF HIS REALM AND SAID TO THEM
BUT THESE TWO YOUNG MEN HURRIED AFTER ME AND LAID HANDS ON ME AND BEFORE THEE CARRIED ME QUOTH OMAR
NOW I HAVE LOOKED UPON OUR LORD SOLOMON WHILE HE WAS YET LIVING AND I HAVE WITNESSED WONDERS BEYOND COMPT AND CONCEPTION AND HE BEGAN TO RELATE
AND ON THIS WISE THE LORD MADE MANIFEST THE INNOCENCE OF THE DAMSEL SUCH WAS THE FIRST OF THE MIRACLES OF THE PROPHET DANIEL
THE ISLAND PLEASED THE PRINCE AND HE SAID TO HIS COMPANIONS WHICH OF YOU WILL LAND AND EXPLORE THEN SAID ONE OF THE SLAVES THAT WILL I DO BUT HE REPLIED THIS THING MAY NOT BE
AND SAID TO HIS MERRY MEN I HAVE A LONGING TO VISIT YONDER ISLAND THEY ANSWERED WE HEAR AND OBEY AND SAILED ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE ISLAND WHERE THEY LANDED AND AMUSED THEMSELVES WITH EXPLORING THE PLACE
MY STAINING LASTS NOT WHILE THAT OF DAYS IS AYE REMAINING DAYS WHEN BECLAD IN GEAR OF YOUTH I FARED RAKED FORE AND AFT BY MEN WITH JOY UNFEIGNING I CRIED
REPLIED THE FIRST ANGEL MY NAME IS GABRIEL
WHEN THERE FELL UPON THEM SORE DISMAY AND THEY TURNED TO FLEE BUT THE APES SEEING JANSHAH'S PROWESS FORDED THE RIVER AND HEADED BY THEIR SULTAN CHASED THE GHULS KILLING MANY OF THEM IN THE PURSUIT TILL THEY REACHED THE HIGH MOUNTAIN WHERE THEY DISAPPEARED
AND PLEASAUNCES MADE AND WEALTH HEAPED UP AND SMITTEN OFF IS MANY A HEAD AND INDEED HE SPOKE SOOTH IN THE WORDS WHOSO SAITH THE WORLD MEANETH WOMAN NOW AS FOR THY CITATION FROM THE HOLY TRADITIONS
AND THEIR GOING WAS LIKE THE BLINDING LIGHTNING SO HE STATIONED HIMSELF IN THEIR ROAD AND WHEN THEY CAME UP TO HIM HE SALUTED THEM AND SAID TO THEM I ASK YOU BY THE ALMIGHTY THE GLORIOUS TO TELL ME YOUR NAMES AND WHITHER ARE YE BOUND
WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FOURTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT JANSHAH READ THIS MUCH UPON THE TABLET
TILL DAY END WHEN THE DIVAN BROKE UP AFTER THE GOODLIEST FASHION AND ALL THE TROOPS WITHDREW AND EACH WENT HIS OWN WAY THEN HE AROSE AND REPAIRED TO THE PALACE WHERE HE FOUND HIS FATHER IN LAW'S SICKNESS GROWN HEAVY UPON HIM
THE FOUR WAZIRS OR CAPTAINS OF THE APES PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM ATTENDED BY THEIR TROOPS WHO RANGED THEMSELVES ABOUT HIM RANK AFTER RANK UNTIL THE PLACE WAS CROWDED
FURTHERMORE ALLAH HAD BLESSED HIM WITH A SON OF PERFECT BEAUTY AND BRILLIANCY ROSY CHEEKED FAIR OF FACE AND WELL FIGURED WHOM HE NAMED ALI OF CAIRO AND HAD TAUGHT THE KORAN AND SCIENCE
AND HE LIVED A LONG LIFE AS KING OF BAGHDAD AND ALLAH BLESSED HIM BY THE OLD KING'S DAUGHTER WITH THREE SONS WHO INHERITED THE KINGDOM AFTER HIM AND THEY ABODE IN THE SOLACE OF LIFE AND ITS PLEASURES
AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE JANE GROWS HAGGARD AND THIN IN SPITE OF OLD MARGERY'S PORRIDGE WHICH IS PUT ON EVERY DAY AFTER LUNCH FOR THE NEXT MORNING'S BREAKFAST AND ANYBODY PASSING GIVES IT A STIR DID YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO MAKE PORRIDGE DERYCK
IN FACT I AM AGREEABLY SURPRISED AT THE EASE WITH WHICH I UNDERSTAND THE NATIVES AND THE PLEASURE I DERIVE FROM THEIR CONVERSATION FOR AFTER WRESTLING WITH ONE OR TWO MODERN NOVELS DEALING WITH THE HIGHLANDS I HAD EXPECTED TO FIND THE LANGUAGE AN UNKNOWN TONGUE
I SHOULD HAVE LIKED THAT WE THREE SHOULD HAVE TALKED TOGETHER BUT NO WONDER YOU WANT A TIME OFF SHALL YOU BE GOING FAR NO I HAVE FRIENDS NEAR BY AND NOW DO YOU WISH TO ATTEND TO YOUR LETTERS YES SAID GARTH REACHING OUT HIS HAND
AND THE MORNING SUN STREAMED IN GARTH IN WHITE FLANNELS WEARING A GREEN TIE AND A BUTTON HOLE OF PRIMROSES LAY BACK LUXURIOUSLY ENJOYING WITH HIS RAPIDLY QUICKENING SENSES THE SCENT OF THE FLOWERS AND THE TOUCH OF THE SUN BEAMS
THE MOONLIGHT CALLED UP MEMORIES I HAD JUST MADE UP MY MIND TO GIVE UP THE NILE
SOME SECRET CARE BESIDES THE NATURAL ANXIETY OF HAVING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS CASE IS WEARING HER OUT SHE MAY CONFIDE IN YOU SHE CANNOT QUITE BRING HERSELF TO TRUST IN YOUR HUMBLE SERVANT
AFTER HER CURT NOD FROM A DISTANCE HAD ENGAGED HIM HE HAD RESPONDED TO THE BLANDISHMENTS OF A FUSSY LITTLE WOMAN WITH MANY MORE BAGS AND RUGS AND A PARROT CAGE WHO WAS NOW DOLING FRENCH COPPERS OUT OF THE WINDOW OF THE NEXT COMPARTMENT
YOU KNOW HE IS ALWAYS SO VERY JUST THERE AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DOCTOR HAD MADE HIM TO MANY A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TIME OF TROUBLE HE WAS THROUGH THE LINE OF PORTERS AND HAD HIS HAND UPON THE HANDLE OF JANE'S DOOR IN A MOMENT
IT APPEARS TO ME YOUR ATTENTION IS GIVEN ENTIRELY TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE CUP AND PLATTER AND YOU CARE NOTHING FOR ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT LIE WITHIN SO IT IS JUST AS WELL TO KEEP HIM DECEIVED MISS GRAY
SHE READ HIS TELEGRAM THROUGH ONCE MORE AND SMILED HOW LIKE HIM TO THINK OF THE COFFEE AND OH HOW LIKE HIM TO BE COMING TO THE STATION SHE TOOK OFF HER HAT AND LEANED BACK AGAINST THE CUSHIONS
AND IF YOU DO NOT KNOW IT NO GROTESQUE SPELLING ON MY PART COULD CONVEY TO YOUR MIND ANY BUT A CARICATURED VERSION OF THE PRETTY SCOTCH ACCENT WITH WHICH MARGERY SAYS STIR THE PORRIDGE NURSE GRAY
AND THIS NIGHT AND DAY TRAVELLING HAD BROUGHT HER AT LAST WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SHORES OF ENGLAND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WOULD SET FOOT UPON THEM AND THEN THERE WOULD BE BUT TWO MORE STAGES TO HER JOURNEY FOR FROM THE MOMENT SHE STARTED
SHE LEANED FORWARD AND SAW THE TINY COLUMN OF BLUE SMOKE RISING FROM THE GRAVEL QUITE STRAIGHT SHE SAID
WITHOUT RUSHING INTO WEIRD SPELLING
AND I LOVE DOCTOR ROB EXCEPTING ON THOSE OCCASIONS WHEN I LONG TO PICK HIM UP BY THE SCRUFF OF HIS FAWN OVERCOAT AND DROP HIM OUT OF THE WINDOW ON THE POINT OF NURSE ROSEMARY'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE I FOUND IT BEST TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK WITH THE HOUSEHOLD
SHE HAD BEEN TRAVELLING NIGHT AND DAY IN ONE FEVERISH WHIRL OF HASTE AND AT LAST SHE HAD BROUGHT HERSELF WITHIN REACH OF DERYCK'S HAND AND DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE TURMOIL OF HER SOUL WAS STILLED
GO BACK AT ONCE DON'T YOU KNOW THAT YOU MUST JANE LOOKED INTO THOSE SHINING EYES SOMETHING SHE SAW IN THEM EXCUSED THE BRUSQUE COMMAND OF HIS TONE
I SAY MISS CHAMPION I WAS CHAFFING THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT SHARPS AND FLATS I CAN PLAY THAT ACCOMPANIMENT FOR YOU IF YOU LIKE NO WELL JUST AS YOU THINK BEST
AFTER WHICH THE DUCHESS EXPLAINS VELMA'S LARYNGITIS LET US HOPE SHE WILL NOT CALL IT APPENDICITIS' AND THEN I USHER YOU UP ARE YOU READY
QUITE RIGHT SAID NURSE ROSEMARY HOW DID YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT WAS ON ONE SHEET A WOMAN'S LETTER ON A MATTER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE WOULD HAVE RUN TO TWO IF NOT THREE AND THAT LETTER WAS ON A MATTER OF IMPORTANCE
WELL TO CONTINUE MY REPORT THE VOICE GAVE US SOME TROUBLE AS YOU FORESAW AND THE WHOLE PLAN HUNG IN THE BALANCE DURING A FEW AWFUL MOMENTS FOR THOUGH HE EASILY ACCEPTED THE EXPLANATION WE HAD PLANNED HE SENT ME OUT AND TOLD DOCTOR MACKENZIE
HE CAUGHT HER BY THE SHOULDERS AND TURNED HER ROUND GO BACK HE SAID AND THE OVERMASTERING NEED QUIVERING IN HIS VOICE DREW JANE'S EYES TO HIS IN MUTE ASTONISHMENT GO BACK AT ONCE AND SING IT ALL OVER AGAIN NOTE FOR NOTE WORD FOR WORD
AND HER OWN MAID WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN A PLACE IN THE DUCHESS'S HOUSEHOLD IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS ON THE PLATFORM AND HER HAND WAS IN DERYCK'S THAT IS RIGHT DEAR HE SAID ALL FIT AND WELL I CAN SEE NOW HAND OVER YOUR KEYS
JEANETTE FROM SIR DERYCK BRAND TO NURSE ROSEMARY GRAY CASTLE GLENEESH
NURSE ROSEMARY SITTING BESIDE HIM DURING LONG SWEET HOURS OF COMPANIONSHIP IS LEARNING IT AND JANE RAMPING UP AND DOWN HER NARROWING STRIP OF DESERT TASTES THE SIROCCO OF DESPAIR AND NOW I COME TO THE POINT OF MY LETTER
WILL YOU KINDLY OPEN IT NURSE AND TELL ME THE SIGNATURE BEFORE READING THE REST OF THE LETTER NURSE ROSEMARY FOUGHT WITH HER THROAT WHICH THREATENED TO CLOSE ALTOGETHER AND STIFLE HER VOICE SHE OPENED THE LETTER
EVERY PERFECT GIFT IS FROM ABOVE WHEN WORDS FAIL ME TO SPEAK OF THE GIFT CAN YOU WONDER IF I APOSTROPHISE THE GIVER
TRUST IN THE LORD WITH ALL THINE HEART AND LEAN NOT UNTO THINE OWN UNDERSTANDING IN ALL THY WAYS ACKNOWLEDGE HIM AND HE SHALL DIRECT THY PATHS ANCIENT MARCHING ORDERS AND SIMPLE BUT TRUE AND THEREFORE ETERNAL
THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HIM JANE KNEW BUT SHE FELT UTTERLY UNABLE TO ARRANGE HOW OR IN WHAT WAY HER GOING COULD BE MANAGED THAT IT WAS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM HER COMMON SENSE TOLD HER
VOICING ITS GENEROUS APPRECIATION OF HER EFFORT AND SANGUINE EXPECTATION OF HER SUCCESS THIS AUDIENCE EXPRESSED ITS ASTONISHMENT IN THE DUBIOUSNESS OF ITS FAINT APPLAUSE JANE SMILED AT THEM GOOD NATUREDLY SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO
BUT OF A DEEPLY MOVED MAN AND HIS EMOTION WAS OF NO ORDINARY KIND THAT GARTH DALMAIN SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO MOVED AS TO FORGET EVEN MOMENTARILY
ALL WANTING TO BREAK EVERY POSSIBLE RULE AND REGULATION AND EACH TRYING TO BE THE FIRST PERSON IN THE FRONT ROW REALLY THE PATIENCE AND GOOD TEMPER OF RAILWAY OFFICIALS SHOULD TEACH THE REST OF MANKIND A LESSON THE DOCTOR TALKING ALL THE TIME
SEVEN PENCE APENNY OF THIS STUFF AIN'T MUCH FOR CARRYING ALL THAT ALONG I DON'T THINK GRUMBLED HIS MATE AND JANE'S YOUNG PORTER EXPERIENCED THE DOUBLE JOY OF FAITH CONFIRMED AND WILLING SERVICE GENEROUSLY REWARDED A TELEGRAPH BOY WALKED ALONG THE TRAIN SAYING
BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE QUIET VOICE FELL SOOTHINGLY EXPRESSING A STRENGTH OF ENDURANCE WHICH WOULD FAIL IN NO CRISIS NOR FEAR TO FACE ANY DEPTHS OF PAIN YET GATHERING TO ITSELF A POIGNANCY OF SWEETNESS
I AM GLAD YOU DID NOT GIVE UP THE NILE TRIP BUT AN EARLY BEE HUMMED IN FROM THE HYACINTHS AND BUZZED AGAINST THE PANE OTHERWISE THE ROOM WAS VERY STILL BUT OF COURSE IF YOU HAD SENT FOR ME I SHOULD HAVE COME
MY LETTER WAS FROM OH DON'T TELL ME CRIED GARTH QUICKLY PUTTING OUT HIS HAND IN PROTEST I HAD NO IDEA OF SEEMING CURIOUS AS TO YOUR PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE MISS GRAY
DID YOU PUT IT IS MOST KIND OR IT IS MORE THAN KIND MORE THAN KIND SAID NURSE ROSEMARY BROKENLY RIGHT FOR IT IS INDEED MORE THAN KIND ONLY SHE AND I CAN POSSIBLY KNOW HOW MUCH MORE
PEOPLE WHO CAN BE DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA AND TALK ABOUT IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO CRAWL ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND HOW ABOUT THE LITTLE MOTHER ISN'T SHE WORTH KNOWING I HOPE SHE SENT ME HER LOVE AND NEW YORK HARBOUR
CAREFULLY PLACING HIS ASH TRAY AND ALMOST UNFAILINGLY LOCATING THE ASH IN TIME AND CORRECTLY NURSE ROSEMARY TOOK UP THE FIRST LETTER READ THE POSTMARK AND DESCRIBED THE WRITING ON THE ENVELOPE GARTH GUESSED FROM WHOM IT CAME
SHE SMILED AS SHE CAME SLOWLY DOWN THE STEPS
AN HOUR AFTER SHE HAD READ IT SHE WAS DRIVING DOWN THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD TO CAIRO EMBARKED AT ALEXANDRIA THE NEXT DAY LANDED AT BRINDISI
DOCTOR ROB'S OWN UNAIDED CONTRIBUTION TO THE FASCINATING PICTURE BY THE WAY I WAS QUITE UNPREPARED TO FIND HIM SUCH A CHARACTER I LEARN MUCH FROM DOCTOR MACKENZIE
I MUST FEEL ABLE TO DICTATE MY LETTERS TO MY SECRETARY WITHOUT HAVING TO EXPLAIN THEM I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR SAID NURSE ROSEMARY HUMBLY I WAS WRONG GARTH STRETCHED HIS HAND ACROSS THE TABLE AND LEFT IT THERE A MOMENT
WITH TORN HANDS AND BLEEDING FEET AND SHE POOR JANE FLOUNDERING IN THE DEPTHS OF THE RED SEA
NURSE ROSEMARY FINISHED READING A LETTER OF HER OWN FOLDED IT AND PUT IT IN HER POCKET WITH A FEELING OF THANKFUL RELIEF DERYCK WAS COMING HE HAD NOT FAILED HER
WITH OLD LACE AT HER BOSOM AND ONE STRING OF PEARLS ROUND HER NECK WHEN SHE APPEARED THE AUDIENCE GAZED AT HER AND APPLAUDED DOUBTFULLY VELMA'S NAME ON THE PROGRAMME HAD RAISED GREAT EXPECTATIONS AND HERE WAS MISS CHAMPION WHO CERTAINLY PLAYED VERY NICELY
MY DEAR JEANETTE CERTAINLY I WILL COME I WILL LEAVE EUSTON ON FRIDAY EVENING I CAN SPEND THE WHOLE OF SATURDAY AND MOST OF SUNDAY AT GLENEESH BUT MUST BE HOME IN TIME FOR MONDAY'S WORK
EVEN SO BOY IS POOR JANE NOW TRAMPING HER PATCH OF DESERT WHICH NARROWS DAILY TO THE MEASURE OF HER DESPAIR MIGDOL IS HIS CERTAINTY THAT HER LOVE COULD ONLY BE PITY
AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE STOOD GARTH DALMAIN HIS FACE WAS ABSOLUTELY COLOURLESS AND HIS EYES SHONE OUT FROM IT LIKE BURNING STARS HE REMAINED MOTIONLESS UNTIL SHE STEPPED FROM THE LAST STAIR AND STOOD CLOSE TO HIM THEN WITH A SUDDEN MOVEMENT
HARD ON THE SECRETARY NURSE ROSEMARY SAT WITH HER PATIENT IN THE SUNNY LIBRARY AT GLENEESH A SMALL TABLE WAS BETWEEN THEM UPON WHICH LAY A PILE OF LETTERS HIS MORNING MAIL READY FOR HER TO OPEN
REPEATED GARTH A SHADE OF PERPLEXITY CROSSING HIS FACE I DO
DURING THE SUMMER I SHALL BE LEARNING STEP BY STEP TO LIVE THIS NEW LIFE IN COMPLETE SECLUSION AT GLENEESH I FEEL SURE MY FRIENDS WILL RESPECT MY WISH IN THIS MATTER I HAVE WITH ME ONE WHO MOST PERFECTLY AND PATIENTLY IS HELPING
JANE STOOD AT THE WINDOW OF HER COMPARTMENT AS THE TRAIN STEAMED INTO CHARING CROSS THE DOCTOR WAS STATIONED EXACTLY OPPOSITE THE DOOR WHEN HER CARRIAGE CAME TO A STANDSTILL
IT IS MORE THAN KIND OF YOU TO SUGGEST COMING TO SEE ME BUT NURSE ROSEMARY DROPPED HER PEN
OH BOY IF YOU COULD SPARE FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND A BREATH OF THE MOORS WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU ALSO I HAVE A LITTLE PRIVATE PLAN WHICH DEPENDS LARGELY FOR ITS FULFILMENT ON YOUR COMING OH BOY COME YOURS NEEDING YOU
I WISH I MIGHT FOR ONCE BORROW THE PEN OF A READY WRITER BECAUSE I CANNOT HELP KNOWING THAT I HAVE BEEN PASSING THROUGH EXPERIENCES SUCH AS DO NOT OFTEN FALL TO THE LOT OF A WOMAN
AN UNREASONABLE ORDER OR A REASONABLE ONE UNEXPLAINED PROMPTLY MET WITH A POINT BLANK REFUSAL AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC STILL OBTAINED THOUGH MODIFIED BY TIME AND EVEN THE DUCHESS AS A RULE SAID PLEASE TO JANE
I SHOULD LIKE TO DICTATE MY ANSWER TO THAT ONE IMMEDIATELY WHILE IT IS FRESH IN MY MIND HAVE YOU PAPER THERE THANK YOU MAY WE BEGIN DEAR MISS CHAMPION I AM DEEPLY TOUCHED BY YOUR KIND LETTER OF SYMPATHY
THE WELL KNOWN NERVE SPECIALIST IN CONSULTATION WITH THE OCULIST AND THE LOCAL PRACTITIONER IN CHARGE OF THE CASE THERE IS A FEELING OF WIDE SPREAD REGRET AND SYMPATHY IN THOSE SOCIAL AND ARTISTIC CIRCLES WHERE MISTER DALMAIN WAS SO WELL KNOWN AND SO DESERVEDLY POPULAR
WITH AN UNCONSCIOUS MOVEMENT OF GRACIOUS FRIENDLINESS GARTH STEPPED CLOSE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE AND TOOK THEM IN HIS WHILE SHE WAS STILL ON THE STEP ABOVE HIM FOR A MOMENT HE DID NOT SPEAK THEN IN A LOW VOICE VIBRANT WITH EMOTION
A SUDDEN BREATHLESS HUSH FELL UPON THE AUDIENCE EACH SYLLABLE PENETRATED THE SILENCE BORNE ON A TONE SO TENDER AND SO AMAZINGLY SWEET THAT CASUAL HEARTS STOOD STILL AND MARVELLED AT THEIR OWN EMOTION
A GREAT CALM TOOK ITS PLACE AND JANE DROPPED QUIETLY OFF TO SLEEP YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS WASHED AND BRUSHED AND GREATLY REFRESHED
YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO BRING OUT A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE COMPLETE LETTER WRITER DO YOU REMEMBER THE CONDOLENCES OF MISSUS PARKER BANGS
AND I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF REPORTING ON THE NURSE SECRETARY READER AND UNSPEAKABLY PATIENT GUIDE AND COMPANION HE PROVIDED FOR ME
SO YOU LIKED MY SONG SHE SAID LIKED
THERE APPENDICITIS I TOLD YOU SO POOR MADAME VELMA LET US HOPE IT WON'T GET INTO THE LOCAL PAPERS OH GOODNESS
AND TAKING ALL OUR MISTAKES AND FAILINGS AND FOOLISHNESSES CAUSE THEM TO WORK TO OUR MOST PERFECT WELL BEING THE MORE INTRICATE AND INVOLVED THIS PROBLEM OF HUMAN EXISTENCE BECOMES THE GREATER THE NEED TO TAKE AS OUR OWN CLEAR RULE OF LIFE
ASKED GARTH MECHANICALLY AND VERY QUIETLY THE HANDWRITING IS RATHER BOLD AND VERY CLEAR WITH NO TWIRLS OR FLOURISHES IT IS WRITTEN WITH A BROAD NIB
BECAUSE SAID GARTH VERY LOW YOU LIFTED THE VEIL AND I I PASSED WITHIN
I FEAR THE DESERT WOULD HAVE TO OPEN ITS MOUTH AND SWALLOW HER UP WE MUST AVERT SUCH A CATASTROPHE
IT OBVIATES THE BOTHER OF TURNING OVER THEY PASSED INTO THE CONCERT ROOM AND STOOD BEHIND SCREENS AND A CURTAIN CLOSE TO THE HALF DOZEN STEPS LEADING FROM THE SIDE UP ON TO THE PLATFORM OH HARK TO THE DUCHESS WHISPERED GARTH
ARE PROVED PERFECTLY RIGHT IN YOUR DIAGNOSIS OF THE SENTIMENT OF THE CASE HE SAYS HER PITY WOULD BE THE LAST STRAW ON HIS ALREADY HEAVY CROSS AND THE EXPRESSION IS AN APT ONE HER PITY FOR HIM BEING INDEED A THING OF STRAW
MY ROSARY SOFTLY THOUGHTFULLY TENDERLY THE LAST TWO WORDS WERE BREATHED INTO THE SILENCE HOLDING A WORLD OF REMINISCENCE A LARGE HEARTED WOMAN'S FAITHFUL REMEMBRANCE OF TENDER MOMENTS IN THE PAST
THE LAST OF THE PILE LAY ON THE TABLE AS SHE TOOK IT UP GARTH WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT FLUNG HIS CIGARETTE END THROUGH THE WINDOW AND LAY BACK SHADING HIS FACE WITH HIS HAND DID I SHOOT STRAIGHT NURSE HE ASKED
THIS LETTER HAS AN EGYPTIAN STAMP AND THE POSTMARK IS CAIRO IT IS SEALED WITH SCARLET SEALING WAX AND THE ENGRAVING ON THE SEAL IS A PLUMED HELMET WITH THE VISOR CLOSED AND THE WRITING
WHO KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS ASKING THAT HE MIGHT CATCH THE EYE OF A GENEROUS TRAVELLER HE FELT HE HAD INDEED BEEN LED TO THIS PLAIN BROWN FACED BROAD SHOULDERED LADY WHEN HE REMEMBERED HOW NEARLY
MAY I COME TO YOU IF YOU JUST SAY COME I WILL COME FROM ANY PART OF THE WORLD WHERE I MAY CHANCE TO BE WHEN THE MESSAGE REACHES ME NEVER MIND THIS EGYPTIAN ADDRESS I SHALL NOT BE THERE WHEN YOU ARE HEARING THIS
WHAT A LOT HE SAID SMILING IN PLEASURABLE ANTICIPATION I SAY MISS GRAY
MY VOICE IN HIS ROOM WOULD MADDEN HIM DOCTOR ROB WAS EQUAL TO THE OCCASION AND WON THE DAY AND GARTH HAVING ONCE GIVEN IN NEVER MENTIONED THE MATTER AGAIN ONLY SOMETIMES I SEE HIM LISTENING AND REMEMBERING
MY ROSARY MY ROSARY EACH HOUR A PEARL EACH PEARL A PRAYER TO STILL A HEART IN ABSENCE WRUNG I TELL EACH BEAD UNTO THE END AND THERE A CROSS IS HUNG O MEMORIES THAT BLESS AND BURN
OVER THE FIRST HALF CROWN HE HAD SAID TO HIMSELF MILK AND NEW LAID EGGS NOW AS HE POCKETED THE SECOND HE ADDED THE OTHER TWO THINGS MENTIONED BY THE PARISH DOCTOR SOUP AND JELLY AND HIS HEART GLOWED
AH THE PORRIDGE GAVE ME MY LOOPHOLE OF ESCAPE WELL AS I WAS SAYING JANE GROWS WORN AND THIN OLD MARGERY'S PORRIDGE NOTWITHSTANDING BUT NURSE ROSEMARY GRAY IS FLOURISHING AND REMAINS A PRETTY DAINTY LITTLE THING
THE LAST FOUR WORDS WERE GIVEN WITH A SUDDEN POWER AND PASSION
DOCTOR BRAND WOULD READ YOU SATURDAY'S AND SUNDAY'S AH I FORGOT THERE IS NO SUNDAY POST SO I SHOULD MISS BUT ONE AND HE WOULD MORE THAN TAKE MY PLACE IN OTHER WAYS VERY WELL SAID GARTH STRIVING NOT TO SHOW DISAPPOINTMENT
SHE EVEN ADDED HER OWN COMMENTARY AND A VERY GOOD THING TOO I AM THINKING FOR MASTER GARTH POOR LADDIE WAS ALWAYS SO SET UPON HAVING BEAUTY ABOUT HIM MASTER GARTHIE I WOULD SAY TO HIM WHEN HE HAD FRIENDS COMING
ONLY IT IS SUCH A PLEASURE TO REPORT PROGRESS TO YOU IN THE THINGS I MANAGE TO FIND OUT WITHOUT BEING TOLD BUT I MEANT TO TELL YOU ANYWAY SAID NURSE ROSEMARY THE LETTER IS FROM SIR DERYCK
THAT JANE'S HALF CROWN WAS NOT A PENNY HE HAD A SICK YOUNG WIFE AT HOME WHO HAD BEEN ORDERED EXTRA NOURISHMENT AND JUST AS THE RUSH ON BOARD BEGAN HE HAD PUT UP A SIMPLE PRAYER TO THE HEAVENLY FATHER
I DON'T THINK I CAN BEAR IT UNAIDED MUCH LONGER AND HE WOULD SO ENJOY HAVING YOU AND SHOWING YOU HOW HE HAD GOT ON AND ALL THE THINGS HE HAD ALREADY LEARNED TO DO ALSO YOU MIGHT PUT IN A WORD FOR JANE
VOLUNTEERING TO SING VELMA'S SONG
NOW THE DUCHESS HAS DONE COME ON MIND THE BOTTOM STEP HANG IT ALL HOW DARK IT IS BEHIND THIS CURTAIN GARTH GAVE HER HIS HAND AND JANE MOUNTED THE STEPS AND PASSED INTO VIEW OF THE LARGE AUDIENCE ASSEMBLED IN THE OVERDENE CONCERT ROOM
TURNED TO THE LAST PAGE AND FOUND THE SIGNATURE IT IS SIGNED JANE CHAMPION MISTER DALMAIN SAID NURSE ROSEMARY
YOU CANNOT VERY WELL EXPLAIN EXPRESSION TO THE BLIND
THEN MOVED ON AS MEN'S VOICES BEGAN TO SHOUT ENCORE
ONE FROM A BLIND ASYLUM ASKING FOR A SUBSCRIPTION A SHORT NOTE FROM THE DOCTOR HERALDING HIS VISIT AND A BILL FOR TIES FROM A BOND STREET SHOP NURSE ROSEMARY'S FINGERS SHOOK AS SHE REPLACED THE EIGHTH IN ITS ENVELOPE
A BECHSTEIN GRAND GLANCED AT THE FESTOONS OF WHITE ROSES AND THE CROSS OF CRIMSON RAMBLERS THEN WITHOUT FURTHER PRELIMINARIES STRUCK THE OPENING CHORD AND COMMENCED TO SING THE DEEP PERFECT VOICE THRILLED THROUGH THE ROOM
A FRIEND IN TROUBLE AND TO BE KEPT AWAY IT IS ONLY HER WONDERFUL KINDNESS OF HEART MAKES HER OFFER TO COME MISS GRAY SHE IS A FRIEND AND COMRADE OF LONG AGO IT WOULD GREATLY SADDEN HER TO SEE ME THUS
CAN POSSIBLY REALISE HOW SHE SANG I KISS EACH BEAD THE LINGERING RETROSPECTION IN EACH WORD BREATHED OUT A LOVE SO WOMANLY SO BEAUTIFUL SO TENDER THAT HER IDENTITY WAS FORGOTTEN EVEN BY THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO KNEW HER BEST
AND JUST AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO MOVE HANDED A CUP OF STEAMING COFFEE AND A PLATE OF BREAD AND BUTTER IN AT THE WINDOW OH THANK YOU MY GOOD FELLOW SAID JANE PUTTING THE PLATE ON THE SEAT WHILE SHE DIVED INTO HER POCKET
SHE SUDDENLY REALISED THOUGH SCARCELY UNDERSTANDING IT THE MUST OF WHICH GARTH HAD SPOKEN AND MADE UP HER MIND TO YIELD TO ITS NECESSITY SO WHEN THE OPENING BARS WERE ENDED
AND THE DUCHESS HAS ENJOYED HERSELF IT HAS BEEN FUNNIER THAN USUAL
STANDING AT THE WINDOW SHE TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE FIRM LEAN FACE NOW ALIGHT WITH WELCOME AND READ IN THE KIND STEADFAST EYES OF HER CHILDHOOD'S FRIEND A PERFECT SYMPATHY AND COMPREHENSION THEN SHE SAW BEHIND HIM HER AUNT'S FOOTMAN
EMBLEM OF THE UNDENIABLE PURITY OF ENGLAND THE STAINLESS HONOUR AND INTEGRITY OF HER THRONE HER CHURCH HER PARLIAMENT HER COURTS OF JUSTICE AND HER DEALINGS AT HOME AND ABROAD WHETHER WITH FRIEND OR FOE
AND WAS LEAVING THE PLATFORM WHEN A SUDDEN BURST OF WILD APPLAUSE BROKE FROM THE AUDIENCE JANE HESITATED PAUSED LOOKED AT HER AUNT'S GUESTS AS IF ALMOST SURPRISED TO FIND THEM THERE THEN THE SLOW SMILE DAWNED IN HER EYES AND PASSED TO HER LIPS
AND THOSE WHO FELT DEEPLY ALREADY RESPONDED WITH A YET DEEPER THRILL TO THE MAGIC OF THAT MUSIC THE HOURS I SPENT WITH THEE DEAR HEART ARE AS A STRING OF PEARLS TO ME I COUNT THEM OVER EV'RY ONE APART MY ROSARY
AND AS HE SPOKE THE LAST TWO WORDS HE TURNED THEM GENTLY OVER AND BENDING KISSED EACH PALM WITH AN INDESCRIBABLY TENDER REVERENCE THEN LOOSING THEM
YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS AND JANE SEATED IN A COMFORTABLE CORNER CHOKED BACK THE TEARS OF RELIEF WHICH THREATENED TO FALL DRANK HER COFFEE AND WAS THEREBY MORE REVIVED THAN SHE COULD HAVE THOUGHT POSSIBLE
A LONG PAUSE NURSE ROSEMARY GRAY WAITED
JANE NEVER DOUBTED HER ULTIMATE DESTINATION THE ROOM WHERE PAIN AND DARKNESS AND DESPAIR MUST BE WAGING SO TERRIBLE A CONFLICT AGAINST THE MORAL COURAGE THE MENTAL SANITY AND THE INSTINCTIVE HOLD ON LIFE OF THE MAN SHE LOVED
AND HIS ONLY COMMENT WAS CERTAINLY MISS QUITE SO BUT ACROSS OLD MARGERY'S COUNTENANCE WHILE I WAS SPEAKING PASSED MANY SHADES OF OPINION WHICH FORTUNATELY
YOU CAN HAVE NO CONCEPTION HOW OFTEN AWKWARD MOMENTS AROSE AS FOR INSTANCE IN THE LIBRARY THE FIRST TIME GARTH CAME DOWNSTAIRS WHEN HE ORDERED SIMPSON TO BRING THE STEPS FOR MISS GRAY
THE RED SEA IS THE CONFESSION INTO WHICH SHE MUST INEVITABLY PLUNGE TO AVOID SCALING MIGDOL IN THE CHILL WATERS OF WHICH AS SHE DRAGS HIM IN WITH HER HIS LOVE IS BOUND TO DROWN AS WAVES OF DOUBT AND MISTRUST SWEEP OVER ITS HEAD DOUBTS WHICH HE HAS LOST THE POWER OF REMOVING
PILOTED JANE THROUGH THE CROWD OPENED THE DOOR OF A NEAT ELECTRIC BROUGHAM HELPED HER IN TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE HER AND THEY GLIDED SWIFTLY OUT INTO THE STRAND AND TURNED TOWARDS TRAFALGAR SQUARE
NOW LET US GO ON BUT I AM RECEIVING NO VISITORS AND DO NOT DESIRE ANY UNTIL I HAVE SO MASTERED MY NEW CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE HANDICAP CONNECTED WITH THEM SHALL NEITHER BE PAINFUL NOR VERY NOTICEABLE TO OTHER PEOPLE
NURSE ROSEMARY GRAY IS GETTING ON CAPITALLY SHE IS MAKING HERSELF INDISPENSABLE TO THE PATIENT AND HE TURNS TO HER WITH A COMPLETENESS OF CONFIDENCE WHICH CAUSES HER HEART TO SWELL WITH PROFESSIONAL PRIDE
I KNEW MIGDOL MEANT TOWERS BUT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE PASSAGE UNTIL I STOOD UPON THAT NARROW WEDGE OF DESERT WITH THE RED SEA IN FRONT AND ON THE LEFT THE ROCKY RANGE OF GEBEL ATTAKA ON THE RIGHT
AND USE IN THEIR VERBS SEVERAL QUAINT VARIATIONS OF TENSE BUT WHAT A SYNTACTICAL DIGRESSION OH BOY THE WOUND AT MY HEART IS SO DEEP AND SO SORE THAT I DREAD THE DRESSINGS EVEN BY YOUR DELICATE TOUCH WHERE WAS I
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NOTHING CONTRABAND I TELEPHONED THE DUCHESS TO SEND SOME OF HER PEOPLE TO MEET YOUR LUGGAGE AND NOT TO EXPECT YOU HERSELF UNTIL DINNER TIME AS YOU WERE TAKING TEA WITH US WAS THAT RIGHT THIS WAY COME OUTSIDE THE BARRIER WHAT A RABBLE
AND WRITE ASKING YOU TO COME AND SEE ME WHEN GENERAL LORAINE TURNED UP WITH AN ENGLISH PAPER AND A LETTER FROM MYRA AND I HEARD WOULD YOU HAVE COME GARTH AND NOW MY FRIEND AS YOU CANNOT COME TO ME
JANE LOOKED UP FROM THE COMFORTABLE DEPTHS OF HER WICKER CHAIR THEN SMILED AT HIS ANXIOUS FACE I AM READY SHE SAID AND RISING WALKED BESIDE HIM HAS IT GONE WELL SHE ASKED IS IT A GOOD AUDIENCE PACKED REPLIED GARTH
I WAS WANTING TO ASK WHETHER YOU COULD SPARE ME JUST DURING FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND DOCTOR BRAND'S VISIT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY I COULD LEAVE YOU MORE EASILY KNOWING YOU WOULD HAVE HIS COMPANIONSHIP IF I MAY TAKE THE WEEK END LEAVING ON FRIDAY NIGHT
THE GOLDEN DESERTS OF EGYPT I HAVE THOUGHT OF YOU AND UNDERSTOOD THEM BETTER BECAUSE OF YOU OH DAL I SHOULD LIKE TO COME AND TELL YOU ALL ABOUT THEM AND LET YOU SEE THEM THROUGH MY EYES AND THEN YOU WOULD WIDEN OUT MY NARROW UNDERSTANDING OF THEM
I KNOW IT IS HARDER FOR YOU THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR ANY OF US BUT YOU WILL BE BRAVER OVER IT THAN WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND YOU WILL COME THROUGH SPLENDIDLY AND GO ON THINKING LIFE BEAUTIFUL AND MAKING IT SEEM SO TO OTHER PEOPLE
NO SAID NURSE ROSEMARY NOT YET
HAVE COFFEE AT DOVER DERYCK JANE GAVE ONE HARD TEARLESS SOB OF THANKFULNESS AND RELIEF SHE HAD BEEN SO LONELY THEN SHE TURNED TO THE WINDOW HERE SOMEBODY FETCH ME A CUP OF COFFEE WILL YOU
AND LOOKED UPON ME STANDING SILENTLY BY AS A PERSON WHO EVIDENTLY DELIGHTED IN GIVING UNNECESSARY TROUBLE HAD IT BEEN DEAR OLD MARGERY WITH HER SCOTCH TONGUE
LEFT THE PLATFORM BY THE SIDE STAIRCASE BUT THERE BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE SEMI DARKNESS OF SCREENS AND CURTAINS A FRESH SURPRISE AWAITED JANE MORE STARTLING THAN THE ENTHUSIASTIC TUMULT OF HER AUDIENCE
AND SHOW THEM AGAIN TO ME IN GREATER LOVELINESS I HEAR YOU RECEIVE NO VISITORS BUT CANNOT YOU MAKE JUST ONE EXCEPTION AND LET ME COME I WAS AT THE GREAT PYRAMID WHEN I HEARD I WAS SITTING ON THE PIAZZA AFTER DINNER
THE ONLY PITY SHE FEELS IS PITY FOR HERSELF THUS HOPELESSLY CAUGHT IN THE MESHES OF HER OWN MISTAKE BUT HOW TO MAKE HIM REALISE THIS IS THE PUZZLE DO YOU REMEMBER HOW THE ISRAELITES WERE SHUT IN BETWEEN MIGDOL AND THE SEA
STRENGTH AND WHITENESS THOUGHT JANE AS SHE PACED THE STEAMER'S DECK AND AFTER A TWO YEARS ABSENCE HER HEART WENT OUT TO HER NATIVE LAND THEN DOVER CASTLE CAUGHT HER EYE SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PEARLY LIGHT OF THAT SPRING AFTERNOON
A LOOK OF REAL ANNOYANCE GATHERED UPON GARTH'S FACE HE SPOKE WITH QUIET STERNNESS A FROWN BENDING HIS STRAIGHT BLACK BROWS YOU READ IT QUITE WELL HE SAID BUT YOU DO NOT DO WELL TO DISCUSS IT
MY GOD HE SAID OH MY GOD HUSH SAID JANE I NEVER LIKE TO HEAR THAT NAME SPOKEN LIGHTLY DAL SPOKEN LIGHTLY HE EXCLAIMED NO SPEAKING LIGHTLY WOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO NIGHT
HE SLIPPED THE SEALED LETTER BENEATH THE REST SO THAT SHE SHOULD COME TO IT LAST OF ALL THEN THE USUAL ORDER OF PROCEEDINGS COMMENCED GARTH LIGHTED A CIGARETTE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE HAD LEARNED TO DO FOR HIMSELF AND SMOKED CONTENTEDLY
BUT THE INJURED PARTS WERE PROGRESSING FAVOURABLY AND ALL FEAR OF BRAIN COMPLICATIONS SEEMED OVER DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HOWEVER A SERIOUS REACTION FROM SHOCK HAS SET IN AND IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO SUMMON SIR DERYCK BRAND
SO I SENT FOR SIMPSON AND MARGERY TO THE DINING ROOM THAT EVENING WHEN THE MASTER WAS SAFELY OUT OF EAR SHOT AND TOLD THEM THAT FOR REASONS WHICH I COULD NOT FULLY EXPLAIN A VERY INCORRECT DESCRIPTION OF MY APPEARANCE HAD BEEN GIVEN HIM
HAD SOUGHT JANE CHAMPION ON THE TERRACE AND STOOD BEFORE HER IN THE SOFT LIGHT OF THE HANGING CHINESE LANTERNS THE CRIMSON RAMBLER IN HIS BUTTON HOLE AND HIS RED SILK SOCKS WHICH MATCHED IT LENT AN ARTISTIC TOUCH OF COLOUR TO THE CONVENTIONAL BLACK AND WHITE OF HIS EVENING CLOTHES
ROSE IN A RAPID CRESCENDO OF QUIVERING PAIN EACH HOUR A PEARL EACH PEARL A PRAYER TO STILL A HEART IN ABSENCE WRUNG I TELL EACH BEAD UNTO THE END AND THERE A CROSS IS HUNG
AND AMONGST OTHER THINGS HE SAYS HE IS COMING UP TO SEE YOU NEXT SATURDAY AH GOOD SAID GARTH AND WHAT A CHANGE HE WILL FIND
AND HASTILY SCANNED ITS PAGES AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PLATFORM IN THE WAKE OF THE CAPABLE PORTER WHO HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER RUGS AND HAND BAGGAGE IN THE PERSONAL COLUMN SHE FOUND THE VERY PARAGRAPH SHE SOUGHT
AS SHE TOOK HER SEAT JANE SUDDENLY MADE UP HER MIND NOT TO SING THE ROSARY AGAIN SHE HAD MANY FINER SONGS IN HER REPERTOIRE THE AUDIENCE EXPECTED ANOTHER WHY SHOULD SHE DISAPPOINT THOSE EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE OF THE IMPERIOUS DEMANDS OF
O BARREN GAIN AND BITTER LOSS I KISS EACH BEAD AND STRIVE AT LAST TO LEARN TO KISS THE CROSS TO KISS THE CROSS WHEN JANE LEFT THE PLATFORM GARTH WAS STILL STANDING MOTIONLESS AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS
BUT HOW FAR LIFE WILL BE WORTH LIVING LARGELY DEPENDS UPON WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR HIM POOR CHAP DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS HE IS MORE SHATTERED MENTALLY THAN PHYSICALLY
AND THAT HER SUREST WAY TO GARTH LAY THROUGH THE DOCTOR'S CONSULTING ROOM SO SHE TELEGRAPHED TO DERYCK FROM PARIS AND AT PRESENT HER MIND SAW NO FURTHER THAN WIMPOLE STREET AT DOVER SHE BOUGHT A PAPER
I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS MADE IN FIVE MINUTES AS WANTED
HE WILL ALWAYS BE BLIND DEAR BUT LIFE HOLDS OTHER THINGS BESIDE SIGHT WE MUST NEVER SAY NO HOPE WILL HE LIVE THERE IS NO REASON HE SHOULD NOT LIVE
KIND OLD SOUL BUT SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE MENTIONED BLIND BARTIMAEUS DIPPING SEVEN TIMES IN THE POOL OF SILOAM IT IS ALWAYS BEST TO AVOID CLASSICAL ALLUSIONS ESPECIALLY IF SACRED UNLESS ONE HAS THEM ACCURATELY NOW
I COULD NOT JEST THUS WERE I NOT COMING SHORTLY TO YOUR AID HOW MADDENING IT IS AND YOU SO PRICELESS BUT MOST MEN ARE EITHER FOOLS OR BLIND AND ONE IS BOTH TRUST ME TO PROVE IT TO HIM TO MY OWN SATISFACTION AND HIS IF I GET THE CHANCE
AH WAIT CRIED GARTH SUDDENLY I WILL NOT SAY THAT SHE MIGHT THINK SHE MIGHT MISUNDERSTAND HAD YOU BEGUN TO WRITE IT NO WHAT WAS THE LAST WORD MATTER AH YES THAT IS RIGHT
NAY MORE THAN HOPEFUL CONFIDENT OFTEN OF LATE IN CONNECTION WITH YOU I HAVE THOUGHT OF THE PROMISE ABOUT ALL THINGS WORKING TOGETHER FOR GOOD ANY ONE CAN MAKE GOOD THINGS WORK TOGETHER FOR GOOD BUT ONLY THE HEAVENLY FATHER CAN BRING GOOD OUT OF EVIL
HIS FACE WAS JUST AS WHITE AS BEFORE BUT HIS EYES HAD LOST THAT TERRIBLE LOOK OF UNSHED TEARS WHICH HAD SENT HER BACK AT HIS BIDDING WITHOUT A WORD OF QUESTION OR REMONSTRANCE A WONDERFUL LIGHT NOW SHONE IN THEM A LIGHT OF ADORATION WHICH TOUCHED JANE'S HEART
AND WAS IMMENSELY PLEASED IF ON OPENING HIS SURMISE PROVED CORRECT THERE WERE NINE TO DAY OF VARYING INTEREST SOME FROM MEN FRIENDS ONE OR TWO FROM CHARMING WOMEN WHO PROFESSED THEMSELVES READY TO COME AND SEE HIM AS SOON AS HE WISHED FOR VISITORS
SO IS JANE'S PUNISHMENT LAID ON AT INTERVALS NOT MORE THAN SHE CAN BEAR AT A TIME BUT ENOUGH TO KEEP HER HEART CONTINUALLY SORE AND HER SPIRIT IN PERPETUAL DREAD AND YOU DEAR CLEVER DOCTOR
AND ALL HIS IDEAS IN TALKING OVER THE DINNER CONCERNED THE CLEANING UP OF THE OLD SILVER AND PUTTING OUT OF VALENTINE GLASS AND WORSTERED CHINA MASTER GARTHIE I WOULD SAY FEELING THE OCCASION CALLED FOR THE APT QUOTING OF SCRIPTURE
I COULD RETURN EARLY ON MONDAY MORNING
INSTEAD OF WHICH LO AND BEHOLD OLD MARGERY MAGGIE THE HOUSEMAID MACDONALD THE GARDENER AND MACALISTER THE GAME KEEPER ALL SPEAK A RATHER PURER ENGLISH THAN I DO FAR MORE CAREFULLY PRONOUNCED AND WITH EVERY R SOUNDED AND ROLLED
LET HER COME GARTH TURNED UPON HER A FACE OF BLANK SURPRISE I DO NOT WISH IT HE SAID IN A TONE OF ABSOLUTE FINALITY BUT THINK HOW HARD IT MUST BE FOR ANY ONE TO WANT SO MUCH TO BE NEAR A
RENDERED RICHER BY THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING O MEMORIES THAT BLESS AND BURN O BARREN GAIN AND BITTER LOSS I KISS EACH BEAD AND STRIVE AT LAST TO LEARN TO KISS THE CROSS TO KISS THE CROSS
AND NURSE ROSEMARY BEGAN DEAR DAL WHAT CAN I WRITE IF I WERE WITH YOU THERE WOULD BE SO MUCH I COULD SAY BUT WRITING IS SO DIFFICULT SO IMPOSSIBLE
BUT FURTHER NORTH AT THE BITTER LAKES A MERE MATTER OF DETAIL IN NO WAY AFFECTING THE EXTREME APPOSITENESS OF YOUR ILLUSTRATION RATHER ADDING TO IT FOR I FEAR THERE ARE BITTER WATERS AHEAD OF YOU MY POOR GIRL STILL I AM HOPEFUL
WAIT A MINUTE THERE IS A NEWSPAPER AMONG THEM I SMELL THE PRINTING INK I DON'T WANT THAT BUT KINDLY GIVE ME THE REST NURSE ROSEMARY TOOK OUT THE NEWSPAPER THEN PUSHED THE PILE ALONG UNTIL IT TOUCHED HIS HAND GARTH TOOK THEM
POOR JANE HAS GOT NO FURTHER THAN HEARING FROM HIS OWN LIPS THAT SHE IS THE VERY LAST PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD HE WOULD WISH SHOULD COME NEAR HIM IN HIS BLINDNESS WHEN SHE WAS SUGGESTED AS A POSSIBLE VISITOR HE SAID
MERE CHANCE AND YET TO JANE IT SEEMED SO LIKE HIM TO HAVE TAKEN UP HIS POSITION PRECISELY AT THE RIGHT SPOT ON THAT LONG PLATFORM AN ENTHUSIASTIC LADY PATIENT HAD ONCE SAID OF DERYCK BRAND WITH MORE ACCURACY OF DEFINITION THAN OF GRAMMAR
CHAPTER FOURTEEN IN DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER GRADUALLY BECAME MORE SOLID AND DISTINCT UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ROSE FROM THE SEA A STRONG WHITE WALL
SHE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT STRUCK ONCE MORE THE ROSARY'S OPENING CHORD AND DID AS GARTH HAD BIDDEN HER TO DO THE HOURS I SPENT WITH THEE DEAR HEART ARE AS A STRING OF PEARLS TO ME I COUNT THEM OVER EV'RY ONE APART
I AM GLAD NURSE ROSEMARY IS PROVING SO EFFICIENT BUT I HOPE WE MAY NOT HAVE TO FACE YET ANOTHER COMPLICATION IN OUR PROBLEM SUPPOSE OUR PATIENT FALLS IN LOVE WITH DAINTY LITTLE NURSE ROSEMARY WHERE WILL JANE BE THEN
MY WIRES AND POST CARDS HAVE NOT TOLD YOU MUCH BEYOND THE FACT OF MY SAFE ARRIVAL HAVING BEEN HERE A FORTNIGHT
SHE WAS EXPERIENCING A VERY CURIOUS AND UNUSUAL SENSATION NEVER BEFORE IN HER WHOLE LIFE HAD SHE OBEYED A PEREMPTORY COMMAND IN HER CHILDHOOD'S DAYS
HER TALL FIGURE SEEMED TALLER THAN USUAL AS SHE WALKED ALONE ACROSS THE RATHER HIGH PLATFORM
DO YOU CONSIDER IT TO BE ADVISABLE THAT I SHOULD SHORTLY PAY A VISIT TO OUR PATIENT AT GLENEESH AND GIVE AN OPINION ON HIS PROGRESS I FIND I CAN MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO COME NORTH THIS WEEK END I HOPE YOU ARE SATISFIED WITH THE NURSE I SENT UP
FROM INFANCY IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT TO ME TO WRITE ANYTHING BEYOND THAT STOCK COMMENCEMENT I HOPE YOU ARE QUITE WELL AND I APPROACH THE TASK OF A DESCRIPTIVE LETTER WITH AN EFFORT WHICH IS COLOSSAL AND YET
I WILL DO MY BEST ONLY ALAS I AM NOT MOSES AND DO NOT POSSESS HIS WONDER WORKING ROD MOREOVER LATEST INVESTIGATIONS HAVE PROVED THAT THE ISRAELITES COULD NOT HAVE CROSSED AT THE PLACE YOU MENTION
BUT NURSE ROSEMARY GRAY HAS BEAUTIFUL HOURS WHEN POOR ANXIOUS YEARNING JANE IS SHUT OUT FOR HER PATIENT TURNS TO HER AND DEPENDS ON HER AND TALKS TO HER AND TRIES TO REACH HER MIND AND SHOWS HER HIS AND IS A WONDERFUL PERSON TO LIVE WITH AND KNOW
AND BEHIND COME GALLOPING THE HOSTS OF PHARAOH CHANCE SPEEDING ON THE WHEELS OF CIRCUMSTANCE AT ANY MOMENT SOME ACCIDENT MAY COMPEL A REVELATION AND INSTANTLY HE WILL BE SCALING ROCKY MIGDOL
HER LEFT WAS PRESSED AGAINST HER BREAST HER EYES RESTED ON THAT DARK BOWED HEAD WITH A LOOK OF UNUTTERABLE YEARNING AND OF PASSIONATE TENDERNESS AT LAST GARTH LIFTED HIS FACE YOURS VERY SINCERELY
IN A TONE OF SUDDENLY AWAKENED ANXIETY
THE LISTENING CROWD HELD ITS BREATH THIS WAS NOT A SONG THIS WAS THE THROBBING OF A HEART AND IT THROBBED IN TONES OF SUCH SWEETNESS THAT TEARS STARTED UNBIDDEN THEN THE VOICE WHICH HAD RENDERED THE OPENING LINES SO QUIETLY
WELL SAID THE DOCTOR NIAGARA IS A BIG THING ISN'T IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY TO ME WERE YOU NOT DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA WE WERE I FEEL TEMPTED TO WISH FOR ONE HOMICIDAL MOMENT THAT THE EARTH WOULD OPEN HER MOUTH AND SWALLOW THEM UP
A VERY HIGHLY EXCITED BOY SHE COMMENCED THE MAGNIFICENT PRELUDE TO HANDEL'S WHERE'ER YOU WALK BUT AS SHE PLAYED IT HER SENSE OF TRUTH AND JUSTICE INTERVENED SHE HAD NOT COME BACK TO SING AGAIN AT THE BIDDING OF A HIGHLY EXCITED BOY
I AM NO LONGER NEEDED NOR ARE YOU FOR THE PATIENT BUT I DEEM IT EXCEEDINGLY ADVISABLE THAT YOU SHOULD SHORTLY PAY A VISIT TO THE NURSE WHO IS LOSING MORE FLESH THAN A LADY OF HER PROPORTIONS CAN WELL AFFORD
MY NIECE JANE CHAMPION HAS KINDLY CONSENTED TO STEP INTO THE BREACH WHICH MEANS THAT YOU WILL HAVE TO STEP UP ON TO THAT PLATFORM IN ANOTHER HALF MINUTE
WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE THEY MARCHED STRAIGHT TO ROME AND AFTER SOME FIGHTING
AND HELPED THEM TO ESCAPE FROM ENGLAND IN A SAILING VESSEL THREE
KHADIJAH THEN ENGAGED HIM AS THE MANAGER OF HER BUSINESS AND HE SERVED HER WELL AND FAITHFULLY SHE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF HIM
BUT GENSERIC DID NOT WAIT FOR THE ROMAN FLEET TO COME TO ATTACK HIM IN HIS CAPITAL WHEN HE GOT WORD THAT IT WAS IN THE BAY OF CARTHAGENA HE SAILED THERE WITH A FLEET OF HIS OWN AND IN A SINGLE DAY BURNED OR SANK NEARLY ALL THE ROMAN SHIPS
MEALS WERE SERVED TO SO MANY PEOPLE THAT SIX FAT OXEN WERE EATEN AT BREAKFAST ALONE HE HAD A HUNDRED AND TEN ESTATES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF ENGLAND AND NO LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PERSONS WERE FED DAILY AT HIS BOARD HE OWNED THE WHOLE CITY OF WORCESTER
BUT SOON HIS THOUGHTS TURNED TO HIS TROUBLES AND HE FORGOT ABOUT THE CAKES WHEN THE WOMAN CAME BACK SHE CRIED OUT WITH VEXATION FOR THE CAKES WERE BURNED AND SPOILED YOU LAZY GOOD FOR NOTHING MAN SHE SAID I WARRANT YOU CAN EAT CAKES FAST ENOUGH BUT YOU ARE TOO LAZY TO HELP ME BAKE THEM
WHEN ALFRED WAS TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD THE DANES INVADED VARIOUS PARTS OF ENGLAND SOME GREAT BATTLES WERE FOUGHT AND ALFRED'S ELDER BROTHER ETHELRED KING OF THE WEST SAXONS WAS KILLED
A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ASIA AND AFRICA AND MUCH OF THOSE IN TURKEY IN EUROPE PROFESS THE MO HAM'ME DAN RELIGION THEY ARE CALLED MOHAMMEDANS MUS'SUL MANS OR MOSLEMS
THE WORK FOR WHICH HE IS MOST CELEBRATED WAS THE IMPROVING AND COLLECTING OF THE LAWS HE MADE MANY EXCELLENT NEW LAWS AND REFORMED MANY OF THE OLD LAWS SO THAT HE BECAME FAMOUS AS ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THE WORLD'S LEGISLATORS
HE GAINED WONDERFUL VICTORIES FOR JUSTINIAN AND CONQUERED SOME OF THE OLD ROMAN PROVINCES THAT HAD BEEN LOST FOR MANY YEARS THE VICTORIES OF THESE TWO GENERALS LARGELY HELPED TO MAKE THE REIGN OF JUSTINIAN REMARKABLE IN HISTORY
ALFRED WAS SUCCESSFUL AND HIS ARMY GREW LARGER AND LARGER ONE DAY HE DISGUISED HIMSELF AS A WANDERING MINSTREL AND WENT INTO THE CAMP OF THE DANES HE STROLLED HERE AND THERE PLAYING ON A HARP AND SINGING SAXON BALLADS AT LAST GUTH'RUM THE COMMANDER OF THE DANES
THEY ENCLOSED HIS BODY IN THREE COFFINS ONE OF GOLD ONE OF SILVER AND ONE OF IRON
AND AT DAYLIGHT THE KNIGHTS OF THE CID MADE A SUDDEN ATTACK THE KING AWOKE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WERE COMING AGAINST HIM FULL SEVENTY THOUSAND KNIGHTS ALL DRESSED IN ROBES AS WHITE AS SNOW AND BEFORE THEM RODE A KNIGHT TALLER THAN ALL THE REST HOLDING IN HIS LEFT HAND A SNOW WHITE BANNER
WERE NOT SAFE WITHOUT HIGH AND STRONG WALLS ATTILA TRIED TO TAKE ORLEANS BUT SOON AFTER HE BEGAN TO ATTACK THE WALLS HE SAW A GREAT ARMY AT A DISTANCE COMING TOWARDS THE CITY
BUT HE WAS DETERMINED TO GO EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD HAVE TO WALK EVERY STEP OF THE ROAD AND LIVE ON FRUITS THAT HE COULD GATHER BY THE WAY HE WAS A BRIGHT CLEVER BOY WHO HAD SPENT HIS LIFE HITHERTO IN A VILLAGE BUT WAS NOW EAGER TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
RICHLY DRESSED HE WAS WELL LIKED AT THE EMPEROR'S COURT AND WAS RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LEARNING TWO ONE DAY A GREAT CHANGE CAME FOR BOTH UNCLE AND NEPHEW THE EMPEROR DIED
IT WAS ONLY FORTY FIVE YEARS SINCE ALARIC HAD BEEN THERE
THE EARL OF WARWICK KNOWN AS THE KINGMAKER
THE ARMY WHICH ATTILA SAW WAS AN ARMY OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ROMANS AND VISIGOTHS IT WAS LED BY A ROMAN GENERAL
HE ATTACKED AND DESTROYED TOWNS AND KILLED THE INHABITANTS WITHOUT MERCY THE PEOPLE HAD SUCH DREAD OF HIM THAT HE WAS CALLED THE SCOURGE OF GOD AND THE FEAR OF THE WORLD THREE
AND THOUGH THE OTHER CHAMPION WAS CALLED THE BRAVEST KNIGHT IN SPAIN THE YOUTHFUL WARRIOR VANQUISHED HIM WHEN ALFONZO A SON OF FERNANDO SUCCEEDED TO THE THRONE HE BECAME ANGRY WITH THE CID WITHOUT JUST CAUSE AND BANISHED HIM FROM CHRISTIAN SPAIN THE CID WAS IN NEED OF SOME MONEY
AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME A GREAT PART OF THE ROMAN FLEET WAS DESTROYED BASILICUS FLED WITH AS MANY SHIPS AS HE COULD SAVE AND RETURNED TO CONSTANTINOPLE THIS WAS THE LAST ATTEMPT OF THE ROMANS TO CONQUER THE VANDALS
BUT A PLOT WAS FORMED AGAINST HIM
AS THEY SAT TALKING BEFORE A HUGE LOG FIRE IN THE GREAT ROOM OF THE CASTLE ENGLAND WILL NOT LONG ENDURE THE MISRULE OF A KING WHO IS HALF THE TIME OUT OF HIS MIND THE EARL SPOKE THE TRUTH
SHE LEFT LONDON AND THE KINGMAKER ENTERED THE CITY IN TRIUMPH THE CITIZENS HAD BEEN VERY FOND OF THE OLD DUKE OF YORK
A ROBBER MET THEM BUT MARGARET WITH WONDERFUL COURAGE SAID TO HIM I AM YOUR QUEEN AND THIS IS YOUR PRINCE I ENTRUST HIM TO YOUR CARE THE MAN WAS PLEASED WITH THE CONFIDENCE THAT SHE SHOWED HE TOOK HER AND THE YOUNG PRINCE TO A SAFE HIDING PLACE
AND DELIVERED TO HIM THE KEYS OF THE CITY THE CID PLACED HIS MEN IN ALL THE FORTS AND TOOK THE CITADEL AS HIS OWN DWELLING HIS BANNER FLOATED FROM THE TOWERS
HE LIVED IN A GREAT CASTLE WITH TWO TOWERS HIGHER THAN MOST CHURCH SPIRES IT IS ONE OF THE HANDSOMEST DWELLINGS IN THE WORLD AND IS VISITED EVERY YEAR BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THE KINGMAKER HAD A GUARD OF SIX HUNDRED MEN AT HIS HOUSE IN LONDON
THOR'IS MOND THE SON OF THEODORIC
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HE WENT TO THE HOUSE OF KHADIJAH FOR HE WAS WELL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT OF BEING EMPLOYED IN SO IMPORTANT A SERVICE
THE HUNS HAD A FAMOUS KING NAMED AT'TI LA HE WAS ONLY TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BECAME THEIR KING BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS YOUNG HE WAS VERY BRAVE AND AMBITIOUS AND HE WANTED TO BE A GREAT AND POWERFUL KING NOT FAR FROM ATTILA'S PALACE
FOR A LONG TIME THE ROMAN LAWS HAD BEEN DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A VAST NUMBER OF THEM AND DIFFERENT WRITERS DIFFERED WIDELY AS TO WHAT THE LAWS REALLY WERE AND WHAT THEY MEANT JUSTINIAN EMPLOYED A GREAT LAWYER NAMED
AND A HARD WORKER HE OFTEN WORKED OR STUDIED ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT WITHOUT EATING OR SLEEPING
AND LIVED IN GREAT MAGNIFICENCE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DID WAS TO REPAY THE TWO FRIENDS WHO HAD LENT HIM THE SIX HUNDRED MARKS HE WAS KIND AND JUST TO THE SARACENS WHO HAD BECOME HIS SUBJECTS THEY WERE ALLOWED TO HAVE THEIR MOSQUES AND TO WORSHIP GOD AS THEY THOUGHT RIGHT IN TIME
IN THE TIME OF CLOVIS THE COUNTRY NOW CALLED BULGARIA WAS INHABITED BY GOTHS ONE DAY A POOR SHEPHERD BOY ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE LEFT HIS MOUNTAIN HOME IN THAT COUNTRY TO GO TO THE CITY OF CONSTANTINOPLE WHICH WAS MANY MILES AWAY
FOR THE ROMANS HAD NOT ONLY MADE GOOD ROADS AND BUILT STRONG WALLS AND FORTS IN BRITAIN BUT THEY HAD ALSO BROUGHT THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION INTO THE ISLAND AND AT ABOUT THE TIME OF THE SAXON INVASION SAINT PATRICK WAS FOUNDING CHURCHES AND MONASTERIES IN IRELAND
I BRING YOU A MESSAGE FROM THE EMPRESS EUDOXIA SHE BEGS YOUR HELP SHE AND HER TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS ARE IN DANGER IN ROME SHE WISHES YOU TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST MAXIMUS SHE INVITES YOU TO COME WITH AN ARMY TO ROME AND TAKE THE CITY
IT ASKED THAT HENRY WOULD DO SOMETHING WHICH WOULD MAKE THE PEOPLE CONTENTED THE KING PAID NO ATTENTION TO IT THEN A WAR BEGAN IT WAS THE LONGEST AND MOST TERRIBLE THAT EVER TOOK PLACE IN ENGLAND IT LASTED FOR THIRTY YEARS
A MESSENGER WAS SENT TO SAXONY TO INFORM HIM OF THE HONOR DONE HIM AFTER A SEARCH OF SOME DAYS HE WAS AT LAST FOUND FAR UP IN THE HARTZ MOUNTAINS HUNTING WITH HIS FALCONS KNEELING AT HIS FEET THE MESSENGER SAID GOD SAVE YOU HENRY OF SAXONY
THIS MADE PEACE BUT THE PEACE DID NOT LAST LONG IN A FEW YEARS ATTILA APPEARED AT THE HEAD OF AN ARMY OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN WITH THIS GREAT FORCE HE MARCHED ACROSS GERMANY AND INTO GAUL
NOT A PIECE OF GOLD WILL BE GIVEN YOU REPLIED KING HENRY OUR TRUCE IS ENDED IN LESS THAN A WEEK A VAST BODY OF MAGYARS ENTERED GERMANY TO RENEW THE WAR HENRY HELD HIS ARMY IN WAITING UNTIL LACK OF FOOD COMPELLED THE BARBARIANS TO DIVIDE THEIR FORCES INTO TWO SEPARATE BODIES
THIS WOMAN WAS A WIDOW WHO WAS CARRYING ON THE BUSINESS LEFT HER BY HER HUSBAND AS SOON AS THE CAMEL DRIVER SAW MOHAMMED HE STOPPED HIM AND SAID MY MISTRESS WISHES TO SEE YOU BEFORE NOON I THINK SHE INTENDS TO ENGAGE YOU TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER CARAVANS
HE WAS DETERMINED TO CAPTURE TOLEDO HE ATTACKED IT WITH A LARGE ARMY IN WHICH THERE WERE SOLDIERS FROM MANY FOREIGN LANDS THE CID IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN THE COMMANDER AFTER A LONG SIEGE THE CITY FELL
AND ON HIS DEATH BED HE SAID TO HIS BROTHER HENRY DUKE OF SAXONY IS THE ABLEST RULER IN THE EMPIRE ELECT HIM KING AND GERMANY WILL HAVE PEACE A FEW MONTHS AFTER CONRAD'S DEATH
AND TWICE HE HAD MADE HER HUSBAND PRISONER AND TAKEN FROM HIM HIS CROWN IN SPITE OF ALL THIS THE TWO NOW BECAME FAST FRIENDS AND THE KINGMAKER AGREED TO MAKE WAR UPON EDWARD AND RESTORE HENRY TO THE THRONE
BUT HE FIRST MARCHED HIS MEN ACROSS THE ALPS THROUGH GAUL AND DOWN TO THE SEAPORT OF CARTHAGENA IN SPAIN WHERE HIS FLEET WAS STATIONED HE TOOK THIS ROUTE BECAUSE HE EXPECTED TO ADD TO HIS FORCES
AND SOLD THERE THE GOODS CARRIED BY THE CAMELS
VITIGES RETIRED TO RAVENNA AND BELISARIUS QUICKLY FOLLOWED AND MADE SUCH AN ASSAULT ON THE CITY THAT IT WAS COMPELLED TO SURRENDER THE OSTROGOTH ARMY WAS CAPTURED
SHE FELL UPON HER KNEES AT THE FEET OF HER HUSBAND AND CRIED OUT THERE IS BUT ONE GOD MOHAMMED IS GOD'S PROPHET MOHAMMED THEN TOLD THE STORY TO OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY SOME OF THEM BELIEVED AND BECAME HIS FIRST FOLLOWERS
HIS CLAIM COMES THROUGH HIS FATHER ONLY YOURS THROUGH BOTH YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER IT IS A BETTER CLAIM AND IT IS A DOUBLE CLAIM THAT IS TRUE MY COUSIN OF WARWICK REPLIED THE DUKE OF YORK BUT WE MUST NOT PLUNGE ENGLAND INTO WAR SURELY NOT IF WE CAN HELP IT REPLIED THE EARL
AND ATTILA HIMSELF FLED TO HIS CAMP IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER BEEN DEFEATED THORISMOND THE CONQUEROR WAS LIFTED UPON HIS SHIELD ON THE BATTLE FIELD AND HAILED AS KING OF THE VISIGOTHS
AND SOON THE ANGLES AND SAXONS ALSO LEFT THE NORTH SEA SHORES AND INVADED THE BEAUTIFUL ISLAND THE NEW INVADERS MET WITH BRAVE RESISTANCE THE BRITONS WERE HEADED BY KING ARTHUR ABOUT WHOM MANY MARVELOUS STORIES ARE TOLD
HAD SETTLED IN PARTS OF GAUL AND THEIR KING HAD NOW AGREED TO JOIN THE ROMANS AGAINST THE COMMON ENEMY THE TERRIBLE HUNS SO THE GREAT ARMY OF THE ROMANS AND VISIGOTHS
AND THIS TITLE HAS BEEN BORNE EVER SINCE BY THE RELIGIOUS CHIEF OF THE MOHAMMEDANS IN MODERN TIMES THE SULTANS OR RULERS OF TURKEY
ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS HAD PASSED SINCE THE DEATH OF CHARLEMAGNE AND HIS GREAT EMPIRE HAD FALLEN TO PIECES SEVEN KINGS RULED WHERE HE HAD ONCE BEEN SOLE EMPEROR WEST OF THE RHINE WHERE THE GERMANS LIVED THE LAST DESCENDANT OF CHARLEMAGNE DIED WHEN HE WAS A MERE BOY
THEY WERE ALSO DEFEATED IN SEVERAL OTHER BATTLES AT LAST THEY HAD TO FLEE FOR SAFETY TO TWO OR THREE TOWNS WHICH THE VANDALS HAD NOT YET TAKEN ONE OF THESE TOWNS WAS HIPPO GENSERIC CAPTURED THIS TOWN
IT ITS WALL AT ONE CORNER IS THE CELEBRATED BLACK STONE MOSLEMS REGARD THIS STONE WITH THE GREATEST REVERENCE THEY SAY THAT IT CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN IT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN ONCE WHITE
WORSHIPED IDOLS VERY FEW OF THEM WERE CHRISTIANS
ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE CHARGE OF MY CARAVANS AND GIVE YOUR WHOLE TIME AND SERVICE TO ME MOHAMMED WAS DELIGHTED
THEY CROSSED THE MOUNTAINS AND ENTERED THE LAND OF THE MOORS SOON THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF ALCOCER AND AFTER A SIEGE CAPTURED IT AND LIVED IN IT THEN THE MOORISH KING OF VALENCIA ORDERED TWO CHIEFS TO TAKE THREE THOUSAND HORSEMEN RECAPTURE THE TOWN AND BRING THE CID ALIVE TO HIM
BUT CAPABLE SO WHEN EDWARD AND HIS FRENCH SOLDIERS LANDED MOST PEOPLE IN ENGLAND WELCOMED THEM THE KINGMAKER WAS NOW ON THE WRONG SIDE
AT MIDNIGHT WHILE THE YOUNG MAN WAS FAST ASLEEP THE LEPER BREATHED UPON HIS BACK THIS AWAKENED THE KNIGHT WHO TURNED QUICKLY IN HIS BED AND FOUND THAT THE LEPER WAS GONE THE KNIGHT CALLED FOR A LIGHT AND SEARCHED BUT IN VAIN WHILE HE WAS WONDERING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
HOWEVER ALTHOUGH HE BECAME KING IN NAME CONRAD NEVER HAD MUCH POWER OVER HIS NOBLES SOME OF THEM REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE HIM AS KING AND HIS REIGN WAS DISTURBED BY QUARRELS AND WARS
AND BROUGHT HIM UP WHEN THE BOY GREW OLD ENOUGH HE TOOK CARE OF HIS UNCLE'S SHEEP AND CAMELS SOMETIMES HE WENT ON JOURNEYS WITH HIS UNCLE TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF ARABIA TO HELP HIM IN HIS BUSINESS AS A TRADER ON THESE JOURNEYS MOHAMMED USED TO RIDE ON A CAMEL
OUR KING SAYS THAT HE WILL GIVE WHATEVER YOU DEMAND FOR THE RELEASE OF HIS SON SAID THE CHIEF TO THE GERMAN MONARCH I WILL GIVE UP THE PRINCE ON THIS CONDITION ONLY WAS THE REPLY THE MAGYARS MUST LEAVE THE SOIL OF GERMANY IMMEDIATELY AND PROMISE NOT TO WAR ON US FOR NINE YEARS
MUCH PLEASED THAT HIS PLANS HAD SUCCEEDED SO WELL HE THOUGHT THAT NOW NOBODY COULD LAY CLAIM TO THE THRONE BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN ONE PERSON DID CLAIM IT
ONE DIVISION WAS SENT TO ONE PART OF THE COUNTRY THE OTHER TO ANOTHER PART HENRY COMPLETELY ROUTED BOTH DIVISIONS AND THE POWER OF THE MAGYARS IN GERMANY WAS BROKEN THE DANES ALSO INVADED HENRY'S KINGDOM BUT HE DEFEATED THEM AND DROVE THEM BACK
BUT IT WAS SO COMPLETELY ROUTED THAT FEW OF HIS MEN CAME BACK TO TELL THE TALE
EGBERT DID IN ENGLAND WHAT CHARLEMAGNE HAD DONE IN GERMANY HE EITHER PERSUADED THE VARIOUS PETTY KINGDOMS OF THE ANGLES THE SAXONS AND THE JUTES TO RECOGNIZE HIM AS THEIR RULER OR FORCED THEM TO DO SO AND THUS UNDER HIM ALL ENGLAND BECAME ONE UNITED KINGDOM
BUT THE PEOPLE ELECTED ANOTHER MAN AND EGBERT HAD TO FLEE FOR HIS LIFE HE WENT TO THE COURT OF CHARLEMAGNE AND WAS WITH THE GREAT KING OF THE FRANKS IN ROME ON CHRISTMAS DAY EIGHT HUNDRED WHEN THE POPE PLACED THE CROWN ON CHARLES HEAD AND PROCLAIMED HIM EMPEROR SOON AFTER THIS A WELCOME MESSAGE CAME TO EGBERT
WHEN THEY DREW NEAR THE GATE THEIR SCARLET COATS EMBROIDERED WITH THE FIGURE OF A BOAR
OF THE MOSQUE AND CHANTING IN A LOUD VOICE SUCH WORDS AS THESE COME TO PRAYER COME TO PRAYER THERE IS NO GOD BUT GOD HE GIVETH LIFE AND HE DIETH NOT I PRAISE HIS PERFECTION GOD IS GREAT IN MECCA
HENRY THE FOWLER KING FROM
AFTER CONQUERING THE VANDALS JUSTINIAN RESOLVED TO CONQUER ITALY WHICH WAS THEN HELD BY THE OSTROGOTHS A LARGE ARMY WAS GOT TOGETHER AND PUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF BELISARIUS AND NARSES WHO IMMEDIATELY SET OUT FOR ITALY
AS HE WENT ALONG BEFORE SAILING WITH HIS ARMY FOR CARTHAGE HE WISHED VERY MUCH TO SEE WITH HIS OWN EYES WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE THE VANDALS WERE AND WHETHER THEY WERE SO POWERFUL AT HOME AS WAS GENERALLY BELIEVED
BEFORE THIS THE GERMAN SOLDIERS HAD FOUGHT CHIEFLY ON FOOT NOT AS THE MAGYARS DID ON HORSEBACK FOR THIS REASON THEY WERE AT A GREAT DISADVANTAGE IN BATTLE THE KING NOW RAISED A STRONG FORCE OF HORSEMEN AND HAD THEM DRILLED SO THOROUGHLY THAT THEY BECAME ALMOST INVINCIBLE
AND GAVE HIM THE BEST EDUCATION THAT COULD BE HAD IN THE CITY
AND THE DUKE OF YORK OR SOME OTHER NOBLEMAN HAD TO GOVERN THE KINGDOM FOR HIM THE EARL OF WARWICK ADDED YOU ARE THE RIGHTFUL HEIR TO THE THRONE
HE WAS ANOINTED BY THE HOLY FATHER AFTERWARDS HE SPENT A YEAR IN ROME RECEIVING RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION TWO
DESTROYS VALUABLE PROPERTY A GREAT MANY OF THE NATIVES OF AFRICA JOINED THE ARMY OF GENSERIC THEY HAD FOR A LONG TIME BEEN ILL TREATED BY THE ROMANS AND WERE GLAD TO SEE THEM DEFEATED
THE YEAR THAT ALARIC SACKED THE CITY OF ROME AT THIS TIME THE ROMAN LEGIONS WERE WITHDRAWN FROM BRITAIN SOME YEARS BEFORE THIS THE SAXONS ANGLES AND JUTES GERMAN TRIBES HAD SETTLED NEAR THE SHORES OF THE NORTH SEA THEY LEARNED MUCH ABOUT BRITAIN
AND AT LAST THE EMPEROR HAD TO GIVE HIM A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
BUT HE WAS YOUNG AND FULL OF SPIRIT AND VERY SOON HE REMEMBERED ONLY WHAT HAD BEEN SAID TO HIM ABOUT HIS BECOMING A GREAT AND FAMOUS CONQUEROR AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR WAR HE GATHERED TOGETHER THE BEST MEN
AFTER A WHILE ALFONZO RECALLED THE CID FROM BANISHMENT AND GAVE HIM SEVEN CASTLES AND THE LANDS ADJOINING THEM
HE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH HOWEVER TO HAVE TWO GREAT GENERALS TO LEAD HIS ARMIES ONE OF THEM WAS NAMED BELISARIUS AND THE OTHER NARSES BELISARIUS WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST SOLDIERS THAT EVER LIVED
O KING I SEE YOU A FAMOUS CONQUEROR THE MASTER OF MANY NATIONS I SEE YOU GOING FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY DEFEATING ARMIES AND DESTROYING CITIES UNTIL MEN CALL YOU THE FEAR OF THE WORLD YOU HEAP UP VAST RICHES
THAT THE BODY STILL LIES IN THE COFFIN IN THE SAME STATE AS WHEN IT WAS FIRST BURIED
THE INFANTRY ALSO WERE CAREFULLY DRILLED BESIDES THIS HENRY BUILT A NUMBER OF FORTS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF HIS KINGDOM AND HAD ALL THE FORTIFIED CITIES MADE STRONGER THE FOLLOWING YEAR THE MAGYAR CHIEF APPEARED AT THE GERMAN COURT AND DEMANDED A TENTH PAYMENT
AND FAITHFULLY PAID OVER TO THE OWNERS OF THE GOODS THE MONEY HE HAD RECEIVED MOHAMMED HAD NO SCHOOL EDUCATION HE COULD NEITHER READ NOR WRITE BUT HE WAS NOT IGNORANT HE KNEW WELL HOW TO DO THE WORK INTRUSTED TO HIM AND
VERY SOON HOWEVER HE WAS AGAIN ON THE WAR PATH THIS TIME HE INVADED ITALY
LAUGHED AT WHAT HE TOLD THEM BUT SOME POOR PEOPLE AND A FEW SLAVES BELIEVED HIM AND ADOPTED THE NEW RELIGION OTHERS SAID HE WAS A DREAMER AND A FOOL MOHAMMED HOWEVER PAID NO HEED TO THE INSULTS HE RECEIVED
AND WISHED HIM TO COME AND LIVE AMONG THEM SO HE SECRETLY LEFT HIS NATIVE TOWN AND FLED FROM HIS ENEMIES WITH A FEW FAITHFUL COMPANIONS HE MADE HIS ESCAPE TO MEDINA
BUT THE CUNNING VANDAL WAS NOT THINKING OF PEACE HE ONLY WANTED TIME TO CARRY OUT A PLAN HE HAD MADE TO DESTROY THE ROMAN FLEET ONE DARK NIGHT DURING THE TRUCE HE FILLED THE LARGEST OF HIS SHIPS
AND WAIT PATIENTLY UNTIL THEY WERE TOLD TO FLY THEN THEY WOULD SWIFTLY DART AT THEIR PREY AND BEAR IT TO THE GROUND HENRY WAS VERY FOND OF FALCONRY AND HENCE WAS KNOWN AS HENRY THE FOWLER OR FALCONER AS SOON AS THE OTHER DUKES HAD ELECTED HIM KING
WHO LIVED BY ROBBING THEIR NEIGHBORS SO THE TOWNS AND CASTLES IN WHICH THERE WAS
THE CID'S HEALTH BEGAN TO FAIL HE COULD LEAD HIS MEN FORTH TO BATTLE NO MORE
TO PREVENT THE CID'S ARMY FROM COMING NEAR THE CITY THE SARACENS FLOODED THE PLAIN BUT THE CID CAMPED ON HIGH GROUND ABOVE THE PLAIN AND FROM THAT POINT BESIEGED THE CITY FOOD BECAME VERY SCARCE IN VALENCIA WHEAT BARLEY AND CHEESE
THE BRITONS WERE DRIVEN INTO WALES AND CORNWALL THE WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE ISLAND THE ROMANS KEPT POSSESSION OF THE ISLAND FOR NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED YEARS
THE MURDERERS SMOTHERED THEM WITH PILLOWS AND BURIED THEIR BODIES AT THE FOOT OF A STAIRWAY IN THE TOWER AND THERE AFTER MANY YEARS THEIR BONES WERE FOUND AFTER RICHARD HAD MURDERED HIS TWO NEPHEWS HE WAS CROWNED KING AS RICHARD THE THIRD
HE WAS BURIED IN THE MOSQUE IN WHICH HE HAD HELD RELIGIOUS SERVICES FOR SO MANY YEARS
I SHALL SET OUT FOR ROME IMMEDIATELY I SHALL PROTECT EUDOXIA AND HER FRIENDS GENSERIC THEN GOT READY A FLEET AND A GREAT ARMY AND SAILED ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN
AND THE PROPER NAME FOR THEIR RELIGION IS ISLAM WHICH MEANS OBEDIENCE OR SUBMISSION
TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE SOME YEARS BEFORE THIS BOY'S UNCLE WHO WAS NAMED JUSTIN HAD GONE TO CONSTANTINOPLE AND JOINED THE ROMAN ARMY HE WAS SO BRAVE AND SO GOOD A SOLDIER THAT HE SOON CAME TO BE
BUT TROUBLE WAS NEAR WARWICK WISHED HIM TO FOLLOW HIS ADVICE EDWARD THOUGHT HE COULD MANAGE WITHOUT ANY ADVICE THEN THE KING AND THE KINGMAKER QUARRELED AND AT LAST BECAME OPEN ENEMIES AND FOUGHT ONE ANOTHER ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE THE END OF IT WAS THAT WARWICK WAS DEFEATED
BUT THE MONEY LENDERS MUST SOLEMNLY SWEAR NOT TO OPEN THE CHESTS UNTIL A FULL YEAR HAD PASSED TO THIS THEY GLADLY AGREED THEY TOOK THE CHESTS AND LOANED HIM SIX HUNDRED MARKS THE CID WAS NOW READY FOR HIS JOURNEY THREE HUNDRED OF HIS KNIGHTS WENT INTO BANISHMENT WITH HIM
WITH THAT SHE DROVE THE POOR HUNGRY ALFRED OUT OF HER HOUSE IN HIS RAGGED DRESS HE CERTAINLY DID NOT LOOK LIKE A KING AND SHE HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WAS ANYTHING BUT A POOR BEGGAR THREE SOME OF ALFRED'S FRIENDS DISCOVERED WHERE HE WAS HIDING AND JOINED HIM
SUDDENLY AND SWIFTLY THEY POURED FROM THE GATE OF ALCOCER AND A TERRIBLE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT THE TWO MOORISH CHIEFS WERE TAKEN PRISONERS AND THIRTEEN HUNDRED OF THEIR MEN WERE KILLED IN THE BATTLE
ALFRED PROVED TO BE THE BEST READER AND HIS MOTHER GAVE HIM THE BOOK WHILE STILL VERY YOUNG ALFRED WAS SENT BY HIS FATHER TO ROME TO BE ANOINTED BY HIS HOLINESS THE POPE IT WAS A LONG AND TIRESOME JOURNEY MADE MOSTLY ON HORSEBACK WITH IMPOSING SOLEMN CEREMONY
THERE WAS A GREAT ROCKY CAVE IN THE MOUNTAINS IN THIS CAVE LIVED A STRANGE MAN CALLED THE HERMIT OF THE ROCKS
AND OTHER COUNTRIES BELONGING TO ROME AND MAJORIAN RESOLVED TO PUNISH THEM SO HE GOT TOGETHER A GREAT ARMY AND BUILT A FLEET OF THREE HUNDRED SHIPS TO CARRY HIS TROOPS TO CARTHAGE
THERE IS A MOSQUE CALLED THE GREAT MOSQUE IT IS A LARGE ENCLOSURE IN THE FORM OF A QUADRANGLE OR SQUARE
AND ENTERTAINED HIM HOSPITABLY NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS THE EMPEROR MAJORIAN OF COURSE PEACE WAS NOT MADE THE EMPEROR LEFT CARTHAGE AFTER HAVING GOT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS HE COULD
EDWARD FLED WITHOUT WAITING FOR A BATTLE AND ESCAPED TO THE NETHERLANDS IN A SAILING VESSEL THE KINGMAKER HAD NOW NO ONE TO RESIST HIM THE GATES OF LONDON WERE OPENED TO HIM AND THE CITIZENS HEARTILY WELCOMED HIM MARCHING TO THE TOWER
THIS BOOK IS CALLED THE KORAN WHICH MEANS LIKE OUR OWN WORD BIBLE THE BOOK
ATTILA AND HIS TERRIBLE HUNS MARCHED THROUGH GAUL UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE CITY OF ORLEANS HERE THE PEOPLE BRAVELY RESISTED THE INVADERS THEY SHUT THEIR GATES AND DEFENDED THEMSELVES IN EVERY WAY THEY COULD
HERE I WILL PERISH IN THE FLAMES HE CRIED RATHER THAN SURRENDER TO MY ENEMIES
AND SOON THEY CAME TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND WERE MARRIED AS HE WAS NOW THE HUSBAND OF A RICH WOMAN HE DID NOT NEED TO WORK VERY HARD HE STILL CONTINUED TO ATTEND TO HIS WIFE'S BUSINESS BUT HE DID NOT MAKE SO MANY JOURNEYS AS BEFORE
AND TRUDGED ALONG THE VALLEY IN HIGH HOPE FEELING CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD REACH THE END OF HIS JOURNEY IN SAFETY
THE RED ROSE PARTY GATHERED ABOUT HENRY TUDOR RAISED AN ARMY AND FOUGHT AGAINST THE KING IN THE BATTLE OF BOSWORTH RICHARD WAS A BAD MAN BUT HE WAS BRAVE AND HE FOUGHT LIKE A LION HOWEVER IT WAS ALL IN VAIN HE WAS DEFEATED AND KILLED
LET US FIRST ASK FOR REFORM IF THE KING HEEDS OUR PETITION WELL AND GOOD IF NOT I AM DETERMINED COUSIN OF YORK THAT YOU SHALL SIT ON THE THRONE OF ENGLAND INSTEAD OF OUR INSANE SOVEREIGN A PETITION WAS SOON DRAWN UP AND SIGNED AND PRESENTED TO HENRY
AT SUCH TIMES HIS FACE GREW PALE AS DEATH HIS EYES BECAME RED AND STARING HE SPOKE IN A LOUD VOICE AND HIS BODY TREMBLED VIOLENTLY THEN HE WOULD TELL WHAT HE HAD SEEN IN HIS VISION
FOR A LONG TIME THE GRANDEST CHURCH STRUCTURE IN THE WORLD THE GREAT TEMPLE STILL EXISTS IN ALL ITS BEAUTY AND GRANDEUR
THE DANES WERE NEIGHBORS OF THE NORWEGIAN VIKINGS AND LIKE THEM WERE FOND OF THE SEA AND PIRACY THEY PLUNDERED THE ENGLISH COASTS FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY
IN A LITTLE TIME A BODY OF SOLDIERS CAME TO HIM AND A STRONG FORT WAS BUILT BY THEM
THE MIND OF THE PEOPLE IN WESSEX HAD CHANGED AND THEY HAD ELECTED HIM KING SO BIDDING FAREWELL TO CHARLEMAGNE HE HURRIED TO ENGLAND EGBERT HAD SEEN HOW CHARLEMAGNE HAD COMPELLED THE DIFFERENT QUARRELING TRIBES OF GERMANY TO YIELD ALLEGIANCE TO HIM AND HOW AFTER UNITING HIS EMPIRE HE HAD RULED IT WELL
ORDERED THE MINSTREL TO BE BROUGHT TO HIS TENT ALFRED WENT SING TO ME SOME OF YOUR CHARMING SONGS SAID GUTHRUM I NEVER HEARD MORE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC SO THE KINGLY HARPER PLAYED AND SANG FOR THE DANE AND WENT AWAY WITH HANDSOME PRESENTS
GELIMER GAVE HIMSELF UP TO BELISARIUS WHO TOOK HIM TO CONSTANTINOPLE JUSTINIAN SET APART AN ESTATE FOR HIM TO LIVE UPON AND THE CONQUERED KING PASSED THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN PEACEFUL RETIREMENT
AND CARRYING OFF PRISONERS ALL THE EFFORTS OF THE ROMANS FAILED TO PUT A STOP TO THESE RAVAGES THE EMPEROR LEO WHO RULED OVER THE EASTERN DIVISION OF THE EMPIRE FITTED OUT A GREAT FLEET AT CONSTANTINOPLE
EVERY MUSSULMAN IS BOUND BY HIS RELIGION TO MAKE A VISIT OR PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA AT LEAST ONCE IN HIS LIFE
THROUGH THEIR MOTHER QUEEN KATHERINE HENRY'S MOTHER WAS DESCENDED FROM JOHN OF GAUNT FOURTH SON OF EDWARD THE THIRD AND THUS THROUGH HIS MOTHER HE WAS OF ROYAL BLOOD AND A LANCASTRIAN WHEN RICHARD THE THIRD BY HIS WICKEDNESS AND CRUELTY HAD MADE ALL ENGLAND HATE HIM
ONE DAY SHORTLY AFTER HE BECAME KING ATTILA WENT TO THE CAVE TO GET HIS FORTUNE TOLD WISE MAN SAID HE LOOK INTO THE FUTURE AND TELL ME WHAT IS BEFORE ME IN THE PATH OF LIFE THE HERMIT THOUGHT FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN SAID
AND CHRISTIANITY BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH EITHER OF THEM
THEY WONDERED STILL MORE FOR THEIR COMPANION GAVE THE LEPER A SEAT NEXT TO HIMSELF AT THE TABLE AFTER SUPPER THE KNIGHT SHARED HIS OWN BED WITH THE LEPER IF THE KNIGHT HAD NOT DONE THIS THE LEPER WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OUT OF THE TOWN WITH NOTHING TO EAT AND NO PLACE IN WHICH TO SLEEP
IN ANOTHER BATTLE BOTH MARGARET AND HER SON WERE MADE PRISONERS THE SON WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED IN THE PRESENCE OF KING EDWARD MARGARET WAS PLACED IN THE TOWER AND KING HENRY WHO DIED SOON AFTER THE BATTLE OF TEWKSBURY
AND THEY HAD NO ARMY STRONG ENOUGH TO SEND AGAINST HIM ROME WOULD HAVE BEEN AGAIN DESTROYED IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR POPE LEO
THEN IT WAS MOUNTED UPON THE CID'S FAVORITE HORSE AND FASTENED INTO THE SADDLE AND AT MIDNIGHT WAS BORNE OUT OF THE GATE OF VALENCIA WITH A GUARD OF A THOUSAND KNIGHTS ALL SILENTLY THEY MARCHED TO A SPOT WHERE THE MOORISH KING WITH THIRTY SIX CHIEFTAINS LAY ENCAMPED
HIS BODY WAS THROWN ON THE BACK OF A HORSE CARRIED TO A CHURCH NEAR THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND BURIED
AND NOTHING WAS KNOWN OF THE POWER OF STEAM FOR MOVING MACHINERY THE SHIPS OR GALLEYS WERE SAILING VESSELS AND WHEN THERE WAS NO WIND THEY COULD MAKE NO PROGRESS EXCEPT BY ROWING WHEN BELISARIUS REACHED AFRICA
HE SAW A VISION OF SAINT PETER WHO TOLD HIM THAT HE SHOULD GAIN A VICTORY OVER THE SARACENS AFTER HIS DEATH SO THE CID GAVE ORDERS THAT HIS BODY SHOULD BE EMBALMED IT WAS SO WELL PRESERVED THAT IT SEEMED ALIVE IT WAS CLOTHED IN A COAT OF MAIL AND THE SWORD THAT HAD WON SO MANY BATTLES WAS PLACED IN THE HAND
AS LONG AS I FIGHT WITH THE SWORD OF TIEW AS SOON AS HIS ARMY WAS READY HE MARCHED WITH IT INTO COUNTRIES WHICH BELONGED TO ROME HE DEFEATED THE ROMANS IN SEVERAL GREAT BATTLES AND CAPTURED MANY OF THEIR CITIES
BUT HAS BECOME DARK FROM BEING WEPT UPON AND TOUCHED BY SO MANY MILLIONS OF PILGRIMS IT REALLY IS REDDISH BROWN IN COLOR BEFORE THE TIME OF MOHAMMED THE KA'A BA WAS A PAGAN TEMPLE
HE ALSO SENT A LETTER TO GENSERIC INVITING HIM TO COME TO AFRICA WITH AN ARMY GENSERIC WAS GREATLY DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE THE INVITATION FROM BONIFACE HE HAD LONG WANTED TO ATTACK ROME AND TAKE FROM HER SOME OF THE RICH COUNTRIES SHE HAD CONQUERED
HE WAS VERY OLD WITH WRINKLED FACE AND LONG GRAY HAIR AND BEARD MANY PERSONS BELIEVED THAT HE WAS A FORTUNE TELLER SO PEOPLE OFTEN WENT TO HIM TO INQUIRE WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN TO THEM
AND MARCHED INTO OTHER PARTS OF THE COAST AND CAPTURED TOWNS AND CITIES BY THIS TIME BONIFACE HAD LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE WICKED PLOT OF AETIUS HE NOW REGRETTED HAVING INVITED THE VANDALS TO AFRICA AND TRIED TO INDUCE THEM TO RETURN TO SPAIN
BUT IN A FEW MONTHS VIT'I GES KING OF THE GOTHS APPEARED WITH AN ARMY BEFORE THE GATES AND CHALLENGED BELISARIUS AND NARSES TO COME OUT AND FIGHT THE ROMAN GENERALS HOWEVER
I WILL BECOME A CHRISTIAN AND SO WILL ALL MY MEN IF YOU WILL GRANT LIBERTY TO THEM AS TO ME AND HENCEFORTH WE WILL BE YOUR FRIENDS ALFRED THEN RELEASED THE DANES AND THEY WERE BAPTIZED AS CHRISTIANS AN OLD ROAD RUNNING ACROSS ENGLAND FROM LONDON TO CHESTER
WHICH YOU WOULD CROSS TO DAY IF YOU WENT TO TOLEDO VALENCIA WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST AND RICHEST CITIES IN MOORISH SPAIN IT WAS STRONGLY FORTIFIED BUT THE CID DETERMINED TO ATTACK IT THE PLAIN ABOUT THE CITY WAS IRRIGATED BY STREAMS THAT CAME DOWN FROM THE NEIGHBORING HILLS
BUT WHEN HE TOOK POSSESSION OF MECCA HE MADE THE OLD TEMPLE THE CENTRE OF WORSHIP FOR HIS OWN RELIGION AFTER MOHAMMED DIED A PERSON WAS APPOINTED TO BE HIS SUCCESSOR AS HEAD OF THE MOSLEM CHURCH
HE GAINED MANY VICTORIES HE MARCHED AGAINST MECCA WITH AN ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND MEN AND THE CITY SURRENDERED WITH LITTLE RESISTANCE THE PEOPLE THEN JOINED HIS RELIGION AND DESTROYED THEIR IDOLS
SO HENRY THE FOWLER LEFT THE CHASE TO TAKE UP HIS DUTIES AS KING OF THE GERMANS TWO IN PROPER TIME HENRY WAS PROCLAIMED KING OF GERMANY BUT HE WAS HARDLY SEATED ON THE THRONE WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS INVADED BY THOUSANDS OF MAGYARS
ONE DAY ALFRED'S MOTHER SHOWED HIM AND HIS ELDER BROTHERS A BEAUTIFUL VOLUME WHICH CONTAINED A NUMBER OF THE BEST SAXON BALLADS SOME OF THE WORDS IN THIS BOOK WERE WRITTEN IN BRIGHTLY COLORED LETTERS AND UPON MANY OF THE LEAVES WERE PAINTED PICTURES OF GAILY DRESSED KNIGHTS AND LADIES
THE BROTHER OF EMPEROR LEO'S WIFE BASILICUS SAILED WITH HIS SHIPS TO AFRICA AND LANDED THE ARMY NOT FAR FROM CARTHAGE GENSERIC ASKED FOR A TRUCE FOR FIVE DAYS TO CONSIDER TERMS OF PEACE AND THE TRUCE WAS GRANTED
SOON AFTERWARDS HE BEGAN TO PREACH TO THE PEOPLE HE SPOKE IN THE MARKET AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES
THE VISIGOTHS AFTER THE DEATH OF
SOME YEARS AFTER THE CAPTURE OF ROME BY GENSERIC THERE WAS A ROMAN EMPEROR NAMED MA JO'RI AN HE WAS A GOOD RULER AND A BRAVE MAN THE VANDALS STILL CONTINUED TO ATTACK AND PLUNDER CITIES IN ITALY
JUSTINIAN ALSO DID A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD BY ESTABLISHING A NUMBER OF MANUFACTURES IN CONSTANTINOPLE IT WAS HE WHO FIRST BROUGHT SILK WORMS INTO EUROPE TO THE LAST YEAR OF HIS LIFE JUSTINIAN WAS STRONG AND ACTIVE
HE WAS SO ENRAGED AT THIS THAT HE AGAIN BEGAN WAR
EARL OF RICHMOND HENRY'S FATHER EDMUND TUDOR WAS ONLY A WELSH GENTLEMAN
HE SAID THAT MANY TIMES THE ANGEL GABRIEL APPEARED TO HIM AND REVEALED TO HIM THE RELIGION WHICH HE AFTERWARDS TAUGHT HIS FOLLOWERS AS HE HIMSELF COULD NOT WRITE HE COMMITTED TO MEMORY ALL THAT THE ANGEL TOLD HIM AND HAD IT WRITTEN IN A BOOK
THAT PEOPLE GAVE HIM THE NAME OF EL AMIN WHICH MEANS THE TRUTHFUL AT THIS TIME HE WAS ONLY SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE BUT THE RICH TRADERS HAD SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM THAT THEY GAVE HIM IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO AND TRUSTED HIM WITH LARGE SUMS OF MONEY
AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND PRIVATE HOUSES
AND WAS BAPTIZING WHOLE CLANS OF THE IRISH AT A TIME IT IS SAID THAT HE BAPTIZED TWELVE THOUSAND PERSONS WITH HIS OWN HAND MISSIONARIES WERE SENT OUT BY THE IRISH CHURCH TO CONVERT THE WILD PICTS OF SCOTLAND AND AT A LATER DAY THE DISTANT BARBARIANS OF GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND
THAT MOHAMMED FLED FROM MECCA THIS EVENT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MOHAMMEDAN HISTORY IT IS CALLED THE FLIGHT OF THE PROPHET OR THE HEJ'I RA
WHEN HE WAS BUT TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE HE WAS LAME IN ONE LEG AND LOOKED AS IF HE WERE A VERY ORDINARY PERSON LIKE MOST OF THE VANDALS HE WAS A CRUEL AND CUNNING MAN BUT HE HAD GREAT ABILITY IN MANY WAYS
OH WHAT A LOVELY BOOK EXCLAIMED THE BOYS YES IT IS LOVELY REPLIED THE MOTHER I WILL GIVE IT TO WHICHEVER OF YOU CHILDREN CAN READ IT THE BEST IN A WEEK ALFRED BEGAN AT ONCE TO TAKE LESSONS IN READING AND STUDIED HARD DAY AFTER DAY
AND TO CROSS RIVERS AND HIGH HILLS BUT AT LAST ONE AFTERNOON IN MIDSUMMER HE WALKED THROUGH THE MAIN GATE OF CONSTANTINOPLE PROUD AND HAPPY THAT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED HIS PURPOSE HE HAD NO TROUBLE IN FINDING HIS UNCLE JUSTIN
AND ELECTED HENRY TO BE THEIR KING AT THIS TIME IT WAS THE CUSTOM IN EUROPE TO HUNT VARIOUS BIRDS SUCH AS THE WILD DUCK AND PARTRIDGE WITH FALCONS THE FALCONS WERE LONG WINGED BIRDS OF PREY RESEMBLING HAWKS THEY WERE TRAINED TO PERCH ON THEIR MASTER'S WRIST
SO HE FILLED TWO CHESTS WITH SAND AND SENT WORD TO TWO WEALTHY MONEY LENDERS THAT HE WISHED TO BORROW SIX HUNDRED SPANISH MARKS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WOULD PUT INTO THEIR HANDS HIS TREASURES OF SILVER AND GOLD WHICH WERE PACKED IN TWO CHESTS
TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS THE PIRATES THERE WERE MORE THAN A THOUSAND SHIPS IN THIS FLEET AND THEY CARRIED A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN
AND IN THE OTHER A SWORD WHICH SEEMED OF FIRE SO AFRAID WERE THE MOORISH CHIEF AND HIS MEN THAT THEY FLED TO THE SEA AND TWENTY THOUSAND OF THEM WERE DROWNED AS THEY TRIED TO REACH THEIR SHIPS THERE IS A LATIN INSCRIPTION NEAR THE TOMB OF THE CID WHICH MAY BE TRANSLATED
JUST AS THEIR FOREFATHERS HAD DONE WHEN THE ROMANS INVADED BRITAIN THUS NEARLY ALL ENGLAND CAME INTO THE POSSESSION OF THE THREE INVADING TRIBES TWO
HE WAS NOT ABLE TO READ WELL IN SPITE OF THE EFFORTS OF HIS MOTHER AND OTHERS TO TEACH HIM WHEN ALFRED WAS A BOY THERE WERE NO PRINTED BOOKS THE WONDERFUL ART OF PRINTING WAS NOT INVENTED UNTIL ABOUT THE YEAR FOURTEEN FORTY NEARLY SIX HUNDRED YEARS LATER THAN ALFRED'S TIME MOREOVER
AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE WAR AGAINST ROME AT THE SAME TIME HE WROTE SECRETLY TO COUNT BONIFACE AND TOLD HIM THAT IF HE CAME TO ROME THE EMPRESS WOULD PUT HIM TO DEATH BONIFACE BELIEVED THIS STORY
AND THEY GAVE TO THE ISLAND THE NAME BRITAIN BUT BRITAIN WAS INVADED BY THE ROMANS UNDER JULIUS CAESAR AND HIS SUCCESSORS AND ALL THAT PART OF IT WHICH WE NOW CALL ENGLAND WAS ADDED TO THE EMPIRE OF ROME
THAT THE COFFIN OF MOHAMMED RESTS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH SUSPENDED IN THE AIR BUT THIS FABLE WAS INVENTED BY ENEMIES TO BRING RIDICULE ON THE PROPHET AND HIS RELIGION
COMMANDER OF THE IMPERIAL GUARD WHICH ATTENDED THE EMPEROR THE POOR SHEPHERD BOY HAD HEARD OF THE SUCCESS OF HIS UNCLE AND THIS WAS THE REASON WHY HE RESOLVED TO SET OFF FOR THE BIG CITY SO HE STARTED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN
PEOPLE CAME FROM DISTANT PARTS OF ARABIA AND FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES TO HEAR HIM ONE DAY SIX OF THE CHIEF MEN OF ME DI'NA
WARWICK THE KINGMAKER LIVED FROM FOURTEEN TWENTY EIGHT FOURTEEN SEVENTY ONE
AND COMPLETELY DEFEATED HIM WARWICK WAS KILLED
AND PERSUADED HIM NOT TO ATTACK THE CITY IT IS SAID THAT THE BARBARIAN KING
HE BUILT GREAT FLEETS AND SAILED OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN CAPTURING TRADING VESSELS FOR MANY YEARS HE PLUNDERED TOWNS ALONG THE COASTS
NOTICED BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE OXEN THE SHEPHERD FOLLOWED THE STREAK OF BLOOD THROUGH THE GRASS AND AT LAST FOUND THE SHARP POINT OF A SWORD STICKING OUT OF THE EARTH HE DUG OUT THE WEAPON CARRIED IT TO THE PALACE
WHEN THE FUNERAL WAS OVER THEY KILLED THE SLAVES WHO HAD DUG THE GRAVE
BECAUSE IT STOPPED THE WAR FOR A LONG TERM OF YEARS WHEN THE MAGYAR KING LEARNED THAT HIS SON WAS A PRISONER IN THE HANDS OF KING HENRY HE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH GRIEF HE MOURNED FOR HIS SON DAY AND NIGHT AND AT LAST SENT TO THE GERMAN CAMP A MAGYAR CHIEF WITH A FLAG OF TRUCE TO BEG THAT THE PRINCE MIGHT BE GIVEN UP
GOD SAVE KING EDWARD BRAVE QUEEN MARGARET WAS COMPLETELY DEFEATED IN ANOTHER BATTLE
A CITY OF ARABIA HIS PARENTS WERE POOR PEOPLE THOUGH IT IS SAID THEY WERE DESCENDED FROM ARABIAN PRINCES THEY DIED WHEN MOHAMMED WAS A CHILD
WERE ALL SO DEAR THAT NONE BUT THE RICH COULD BUY THEM PEOPLE ATE HORSES DOGS CATS AND MICE UNTIL IN THE WHOLE CITY ONLY THREE HORSES AND A MULE WERE LEFT ALIVE THEN ON THE FIFTEENTH OF JUNE TEN NINETY FOUR THE GOVERNOR WENT TO THE CAMP OF THE CID
TO THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER WHEN THE EMPEROR MAXIMUS HEARD THAT THE VANDALS WERE COMING HE PREPARED TO FLEE FROM THE CITY AND HE ADVISED THE SENATE TO DO THE SAME THE PEOPLE WERE SO ANGRY AT THIS
THOSE WHO FOUGHT ON THE KING'S SIDE WERE CALLED LANCASTRIANS BECAUSE HENRY'S ANCESTOR JOHN OF GAUNT WAS THE DUKE OF LANCASTER
HE LEFT FIVE MEN AS A GUARD IN EACH VESSEL AND WITH THE BODY OF HIS ARMY HE MARCHED FOR SOME DAYS ALONG THE COAST THE PEOPLE RECEIVED HIM IN A FRIENDLY WAY FOR THEY HAD GROWN TIRED OF THE RULE OF THE VANDALS
THREE WHEN MOHAMMED RETURNED HOME AFTER THE ANGEL HAD FIRST SPOKEN TO HIM HE TOLD HIS WIFE OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD SHE AT ONCE BELIEVED AND SO BECAME A CONVERT TO THE NEW RELIGION
HOW D'YOU DO MISTER FLANDERS SAID JULIA ELIOT HOLDING OUT HER HAND WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING TO YOU WHO IS SILVIA WHAT IS SHE THAT ALL OUR SWAINS COMMEND HER SANG ELSBETH SIDDONS EVERY ONE STOOD WHERE THEY WERE OR SAT DOWN IF A CHAIR WAS EMPTY

JINNY CARSLAKE AND JACOB FLANDERS WALKED IN A ROW ALONG THE YELLOW GRAVEL PATH GOT ON TO THE GRASS SO PASSED UNDER THE TREES AND CAME OUT AT THE SUMMER HOUSE WHERE MARIE ANTOINETTE USED TO DRINK CHOCOLATE
THOUGH JACOB SHIFTED PERHAPS FIVE INCHES TO THE LEFT AND THEN AS MANY TO THE RIGHT THEN JACOB GRUNTED AND SUDDENLY CROSSED THE ROOM WILL YOU COME AND HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT HE SAID TO CLARA DURRANT YES AN ICE QUICKLY

MISSUS FLANDERS HAD LEFT THE LAMP BURNING IN THE FRONT ROOM THERE WERE HER SPECTACLES HER SEWING AND A LETTER WITH THE SCARBOROUGH POSTMARK SHE HAD NOT DRAWN THE CURTAINS EITHER
MISSUS JARVIS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO THINK OF HERSELF TO NIGHT IT WAS SO CALM THERE WAS NO WIND NOTHING RACING FLYING ESCAPING BLACK SHADOWS STOOD STILL OVER THE SILVER MOORS

HE WAS ABOUT TO ROAR WHEN LYING AMONG THE BLACK STICKS AND STRAW UNDER THE CLIFF HE SAW A WHOLE SKULL PERHAPS A COW'S SKULL A SKULL PERHAPS WITH THE TEETH IN IT SOBBING BUT ABSENT MINDEDLY HE RAN FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY UNTIL HE HELD THE SKULL IN HIS ARMS
AND CRUTTENDON WAVING HIS HAND DISAPPEARED LIKE THE VERY GREAT GENIUS THAT HE WAS NO MISSUS FLANDERS WAS TOLD NONE OF THIS
AS THOUGH IT COULD IMPOSE ITSELF UPON TIME AND THE OPEN AIR NOW A FOX STEALS OUT FROM BEHIND THE GORSE BUSHES OFTEN EVEN AT NIGHT THE CHURCH SEEMS FULL OF PEOPLE THE PEWS ARE WORN AND GREASY
AND THE CASSOCKS IN PLACE AND THE HYMN BOOKS ON THE LEDGES IT IS A SHIP WITH ALL ITS CREW ABOARD THE TIMBERS STRAIN TO HOLD THE DEAD AND THE LIVING THE PLOUGHMEN THE CARPENTERS THE FOX HUNTING GENTLEMEN
CLEAN WHITE WIND SWEPT SAND RUBBED A MORE UNPOLLUTED PIECE OF BONE EXISTED NOWHERE ON THE COAST OF CORNWALL THE SEA HOLLY WOULD GROW THROUGH THE EYE SOCKETS IT WOULD TURN TO POWDER OR SOME GOLFER HITTING HIS BALL ONE FINE DAY WOULD DISPERSE A LITTLE DUST
YELLOW AND JADED NEXT MORNING NOT FIT TO BE SEEN ON THE WHOLE THOUGH THE PRICE IS SINFUL CARNATIONS PAY BEST IT'S A QUESTION HOWEVER WHETHER IT'S WISE TO HAVE THEM WIRED SOME SHOPS ADVISE IT
SIX YARDS OF SILK WILL COVER ONE BODY BUT IF YOU HAVE TO DEVISE SIX HUNDRED SHAPES FOR IT AND TWICE AS MANY COLOURS IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH THERE IS THE URGENT QUESTION OF THE PUDDING WITH TUFTS OF GREEN CREAM AND BATTLEMENTS OF ALMOND PASTE
IT HAS NOT ARRIVED THE FLAMINGO HOURS FLUTTERED SOFTLY THROUGH THE SKY BUT REGULARLY THEY DIPPED THEIR WINGS IN PITCH BLACK NOTTING HILL FOR INSTANCE OR THE PURLIEUS OF CLERKENWELL
IN THESE SHELTERED LAKES THE LITTLE COLOURED FLOWERS SWAM AND SLID SURMOUNTED SMOOTH SLIPPERY WAVES AND SOMETIMES FOUNDERED AND LAY LIKE PEBBLES ON THE GLASS FLOOR THEIR FORTUNES WERE WATCHED BY EYES INTENT AND LOVELY
THE MOONLIGHT DESTROYED NOTHING THE MOOR ACCEPTED EVERYTHING TOM GAGE CRIES ALOUD SO LONG AS HIS TOMBSTONE ENDURES THE ROMAN SKELETONS ARE IN SAFE KEEPING
FOR EXAMPLE TAKE THIS SCENE HERE WAS JACOB FLANDERS GONE ABROAD AND STAYING TO BREAK HIS JOURNEY IN PARIS OLD MISS BIRKBECK HIS MOTHER'S COUSIN HAD DIED LAST JUNE AND LEFT HIM A HUNDRED POUNDS
DID HE TAKE HIS BOTTLE WELL MISSUS FLANDERS WHISPERED AND REBECCA NODDED AND WENT TO THE COT AND TURNED DOWN THE QUILT AND MISSUS FLANDERS BENT OVER AND LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT THE BABY ASLEEP BUT FROWNING

HE EXCLAIMED AS THE WINE WASHED OVER THE RIM HANG THERE LIKE FRUIT MY SOUL CRUTTENDON AND JACOB BOTH BEGAN AGAIN AT THE SAME MOMENT AND BOTH BURST OUT LAUGHING CURSE THESE FLIES
SOBBING THE WORDS OUT ON THE CREST OF EACH GASPING BREATH THE WAVES CAME ROUND HER SHE WAS A ROCK SHE WAS COVERED WITH THE SEAWEED WHICH POPS WHEN IT IS PRESSED HE WAS LOST THERE HE STOOD HIS FACE COMPOSED ITSELF
THE FURZE BUSHES STOOD PERFECTLY STILL NEITHER DID MISSUS JARVIS THINK OF GOD THERE WAS A CHURCH BEHIND THEM OF COURSE THE CHURCH CLOCK STRUCK TEN DID THE STROKES REACH THE FURZE BUSH
MISSUS JARVIS WAS NOT LIKED IN THE VILLAGE YOU NEVER WALK AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT SHE ASKED MISSUS FLANDERS IT IS CERTAINLY WONDERFULLY MILD SAID MISSUS FLANDERS

THE ROCK WAS ONE OF THOSE TREMENDOUSLY SOLID BROWN OR RATHER BLACK ROCKS WHICH EMERGE FROM THE SAND LIKE SOMETHING PRIMITIVE ROUGH WITH CRINKLED LIMPET SHELLS AND SPARSELY STREWN WITH LOCKS OF DRY SEAWEED A SMALL BOY HAS TO STRETCH HIS LEGS FAR APART
BETTY FLANDERS'S DARNING NEEDLES ARE SAFE TOO AND HER GARNET BROOCH AND SOMETIMES AT MIDDAY IN THE SUNSHINE
AS IF A WOMAN WEARING A DIAMOND NECKLACE TURNED HER HEAD THIS WAY AND THAT HOW QUIET IT IS SAID MISSUS JARVIS MISSUS FLANDERS RUBBED THE TURF WITH HER TOE THINKING OF HER GARNET BROOCH

SHUT YOUR EYES AND THINK OF THE FAIRIES FAST ASLEEP UNDER THE FLOWERS I THOUGHT HE'D NEVER GET OFF SUCH A HURRICANE SHE WHISPERED TO REBECCA WHO WAS BENDING OVER A SPIRIT LAMP IN THE SMALL ROOM NEXT DOOR THE WIND RUSHED OUTSIDE BUT THE SMALL FLAME OF THE SPIRIT LAMP BURNT QUIETLY SHADED FROM THE COT BY A BOOK STOOD ON EDGE
AH SIGHED CLARA WHO STOOD BESIDE JACOB HALF WAY THROUGH THEN TO SILVIA LET US SING THAT SILVIA IS EXCELLING SHE EXCELS EACH MORTAL THING UPON THE DULL EARTH DWELLING TO HER LET US GARLANDS BRING
IN THE OTHER BED BY THE DOOR JACOB LAY ASLEEP FAST ASLEEP PROFOUNDLY UNCONSCIOUS THE SHEEP'S JAW WITH THE BIG YELLOW TEETH IN IT LAY AT HIS FEET HE HAD KICKED IT AGAINST THE IRON BED RAIL OUTSIDE THE RAIN POURED DOWN MORE DIRECTLY AND POWERFULLY AS THE WIND FELL IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING
THE LODGING HOUSE SEEMED FULL OF GURGLING AND RUSHING THE CISTERN OVERFLOWING WATER BUBBLING AND SQUEAKING AND RUNNING ALONG THE PIPES AND STREAMING DOWN THE WINDOWS WHAT'S ALL THAT WATER RUSHING IN MURMURED ARCHER IT'S ONLY THE BATH WATER RUNNING AWAY SAID MISSUS FLANDERS
THE FRINGE OF YELLOW BROWN SEAWEED FLUTTERS AND OUT PUSHES AN OPAL SHELLED CRAB OH A HUGE CRAB JACOB MURMURED AND BEGINS HIS JOURNEY ON WEAKLY LEGS ON THE SANDY BOTTOM NOW
HOW IT SPREAD OVER THE TOWN IN THE HOLLOW HOW THE LIGHTS SEEMED TO WINK AND QUIVER IN ITS FURY LIGHTS IN THE HARBOUR LIGHTS IN BEDROOM WINDOWS HIGH UP AND ROLLING DARK WAVES BEFORE IT IT RACED OVER THE ATLANTIC JERKING THE STARS ABOVE THE SHIPS THIS WAY AND THAT
FINE THE CHILDREN DEMONS AND JACOB FLANDERS UNWORLDLY CLARA DURRANT PROCURED THE STOCKINGS PLAYED THE SONATA FILLED THE VASES FETCHED THE PUDDING
YET IT WAS YEARS SINCE SHE HAD OPENED THE ORCHARD GATE AND GONE OUT ON DODS HILL AFTER DINNER IT IS PERFECTLY DRY SAID MISSUS JARVIS AS THEY SHUT THE ORCHARD DOOR AND STEPPED ON TO THE TURF I SHAN'T GO FAR
BUT EVEN IF THE CARDS SHOULD BE SUPERSEDED WHICH SEEMS UNLIKELY THERE ARE UNRULY POWERS BLOWING LIFE INTO STORMS DISORDERING SEDULOUS MORNINGS AND UPROOTING THE STABILITY OF THE AFTERNOON DRESSMAKERS THAT IS TO SAY AND CONFECTIONERS SHOPS
HER BROWN WOOL WOUND ROUND AN OLD POSTCARD THERE WERE THE BULRUSHES AND THE STRAND MAGAZINES AND THE LINOLEUM SANDY FROM THE BOYS BOOTS A DADDY LONG LEGS SHOT FROM CORNER TO CORNER AND HIT THE LAMP GLOBE
THERE'S TITIAN AND SO HAVING FOUND THE RIGHT TINT UP HE LOOKED AND SAW TO HIS HORROR A CLOUD OVER THE BAY MISSUS FLANDERS ROSE SLAPPED HER COAT THIS SIDE AND THAT TO GET THE SAND OFF AND PICKED UP HER BLACK PARASOL

HOLDING ARCHER'S HAND AND TELLING THE STORY OF THE GUNPOWDER EXPLOSION IN WHICH POOR MISTER CURNOW HAD LOST HIS EYE MISSUS FLANDERS HURRIED UP THE STEEP LANE AWARE ALL THE TIME IN THE DEPTHS OF HER MIND OF SOME BURIED DISCOMFORT THERE ON THE SAND NOT FAR FROM THE LOVERS LAY THE OLD SHEEP'S SKULL WITHOUT ITS JAW
AN ENORMOUS MAN AND WOMAN IT WAS EARLY CLOSING DAY WERE STRETCHED MOTIONLESS WITH THEIR HEADS ON POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS SIDE BY SIDE WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SEA WHILE TWO OR THREE GULLS GRACEFULLY SKIRTED THE INCOMING WAVES AND SETTLED NEAR THEIR BOOTS
AND KITTY CRASTER MARRIED HIM ON THE STRENGTH OF IT SIX MONTHS LATER BUT REAL FLOWERS CAN NEVER BE DISPENSED WITH IF THEY COULD HUMAN LIFE WOULD BE A DIFFERENT AFFAIR ALTOGETHER FOR FLOWERS FADE CHRYSANTHEMUMS ARE THE WORST PERFECT OVER NIGHT
LAST TIME WE MET SAID MISTER SALVIN WAS AT THE FARQUHARS POOR LADY SHE HAS MUCH TO PUT UP WITH DOESN'T SHE LOOK CHARMING EXCLAIMED MISS ELIOT AS CLARA DURRANT PASSED THEM
AND CLASPING HER HANDS BEHIND HER HEAD BETTY FLANDERS DID NOT HEAR FOR HER SCISSORS MADE SO MUCH NOISE ON THE TABLE THEY ARE AT REST SAID MISSUS JARVIS AND WE SPEND OUR DAYS DOING FOOLISH UNNECESSARY THINGS WITHOUT KNOWING WHY
THE FISHING BOATS WERE LEANING TO THE WATER'S BRIM A PALE YELLOW LIGHT SHOT ACROSS THE PURPLE SEA AND SHUT THE LIGHTHOUSE WAS LIT COME ALONG SAID BETTY FLANDERS THE SUN BLAZED IN THEIR FACES AND GILDED THE GREAT BLACKBERRIES TREMBLING OUT FROM THE HEDGE WHICH ARCHER TRIED TO STRIP AS THEY PASSED
WHY DIDN'T YOU STAY WITH US NAUGHTY LITTLE BOY NOW PUT IT DOWN NOW COME ALONG BOTH OF YOU AND SHE SWEPT ROUND HOLDING ARCHER BY ONE HAND AND FUMBLING FOR JACOB'S ARM WITH THE OTHER BUT HE DUCKED DOWN AND PICKED UP THE SHEEP'S JAW WHICH WAS LOOSE SWINGING HER BAG CLUTCHING HER PARASOL
AND ILLUMINES THE KNEELING FAMILY IN THE NICHE AND THE TABLET SET UP IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TO THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH WHO RELIEVED THE POOR AND BELIEVED IN GOD SO THE MEASURED VOICE GOES ON DOWN THE MARBLE SCROLL
THE CLOCK STRIKING FOUR STRAIGHT THROUGH THE CIRCLING NOTES THE GLASS PURPLING UNDER A STORM CLOUD AND THE TWO DOZEN HOUSES OF THE VILLAGE COWERING INFINITELY HUMBLE IN COMPANY UNDER A LEAF OF SHADOW
A GARNET BROOCH HAS DROPPED INTO ITS GRASS A FOX PADS STEALTHILY A LEAF TURNS ON ITS EDGE MISSUS JARVIS WHO IS FIFTY YEARS OF AGE REPOSES IN THE CAMP IN THE HAZY MOONLIGHT AND
EDWARD WAITED AND BOTH LOOKED AT JACOB WELL SAID JACOB SMILING AND PRESSING BOTH HANDS ON HIS STICK COME ALONG HE DECIDED AND STARTED OFF THE OTHERS FOLLOWED HIM SMILING
IS MUCH CLEARER THAN THIS SOMETIMES SAID MISSUS JARVIS STANDING UPON THE RIDGE THERE WERE NO CLOUDS AND YET THERE WAS A HAZE OVER THE SEA AND OVER THE MOORS THE LIGHTS OF SCARBOROUGH FLASHED
SHE SAID IT KEPT THE WATER PURE FOR DAYS AND DAYS BUT THERE IS SOME REASON TO THINK THAT OLD MISSUS TEMPLE WAS MISTAKEN THE LITTLE CARDS HOWEVER WITH NAMES ENGRAVED ON THEM ARE A MORE SERIOUS PROBLEM THAN THE FLOWERS
FOLDING HER HANDS OVER THE TOP OF HER GLASS I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHAT TED MEANS WHEN HE SAYS A THING LIKE THAT SHE SAID LOOKING AT JACOB BUT I DO SOMETIMES I COULD KILL MYSELF SOMETIMES HE LIES IN BED ALL DAY LONG JUST LIES THERE

IT WAS ONLY THAT HE COULD MAKE NO SENSE HIMSELF OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY EXCITEMENT AND AS FOR WRITING IT DOWN JACOB'S LETTERS ARE SO LIKE HIM SAID MISSUS JARVIS FOLDING THE SHEET
EDWIN MALLETT FOR EXAMPLE WROTE HIS VERSES ENDING AND READ THEIR DOOM IN CHLOE'S EYES WHICH CAUSED CLARA TO BLUSH AT THE FIRST READING AND TO LAUGH AT THE SECOND SAYING THAT IT WAS JUST LIKE HIM TO CALL HER CHLOE WHEN HER NAME WAS CLARA
RIDICULOUS YOUNG MAN BUT WHEN BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN ON A RAINY MORNING EDWIN MALLETT LAID HIS LIFE AT HER FEET SHE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM AND HID HERSELF IN HER BEDROOM AND TIMOTHY BELOW COULD NOT GET ON WITH HIS WORK ALL THAT MORNING ON ACCOUNT OF HER SOBS
SQUEEZING OUT RAW SIENNA AND KEEPING HIS EYES FIXED ON BETTY FLANDERS'S BACK

A LIVE ENGLISH MATRON GROWING STOUT THE CLOCK STRUCK THE QUARTER THE FRAIL WAVES OF SOUND BROKE AMONG THE STIFF GORSE AND THE HAWTHORN TWIGS AS THE CHURCH CLOCK DIVIDED TIME INTO QUARTERS

I AM AFRAID I DID NOT CATCH YOUR NAME SAID MISS EDWARDS CALTHORP SAID MISTER CALTHORP BUT WHAT PROOF WAS THERE THAT THE MARRIAGE SERVICE WAS ACTUALLY PERFORMED SAID MISTER CROSBY
IT IS SURELY A GREAT DISCOVERY THAT LEADS TO THE UNION OF HEARTS AND FOUNDATION OF HOMES THE PAPER FLOWERS DID NO LESS IT MUST NOT BE THOUGHT THOUGH THAT THEY OUSTED THE FLOWERS OF NATURE
ARCHER SAID MISSUS FLANDERS WITH THAT TENDERNESS WHICH MOTHERS SO OFTEN DISPLAY TOWARDS THEIR ELDEST SONS WILL BE AT GIBRALTAR TO MORROW THE POST FOR WHICH SHE WAS WAITING STROLLING UP DODS HILL WHILE THE RANDOM CHURCH BELLS SWUNG A HYMN TUNE ABOUT HER HEAD

SUCH WERE THE VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES OF THE INVENTION OF PAPER FLOWERS TO SWIM IN BOWLS PLEASE SAID JULIA ELIOT TAKING UP HER POSITION BY THE CURTAIN ALMOST OPPOSITE THE DOOR DON'T INTRODUCE ME I LIKE TO LOOK ON
AND THEN THEY WENT TO THE LITTLE CAFE IN THE BY STREET WHERE PEOPLE SIT DRINKING COFFEE WATCHING THE SOLDIERS MEDITATIVELY KNOCKING ASHES INTO TRAYS BUT HE'S QUITE DIFFERENT SAID JINNY
CERTAINLY IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THEM AT A DANCE BUT WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY AT DINNER PARTIES UNLESS THE ROOMS ARE VERY HOT REMAINS IN DISPUTE OLD MISSUS TEMPLE USED TO RECOMMEND AN IVY LEAF JUST ONE DROPPED INTO THE BOWL

THAT MARRIAGE IS A FORTRESS AND WIDOWS STRAY SOLITARY IN THE OPEN FIELDS PICKING UP STONES GLEANING A FEW GOLDEN STRAWS LONELY UNPROTECTED POOR CREATURES
SHE SAID JUMPING DOWN AND THEN THE DAZZLING WHITE WATER ROUGH AND THROTTLED SHOT UP INTO THE AIR THE FOUNTAIN SPREAD ITSELF THROUGH IT CAME THE SOUND OF MILITARY MUSIC FAR AWAY
ARCHER LAY SPREAD OUT WITH ONE ARM STRIKING ACROSS THE PILLOW HE WAS FLUSHED AND WHEN THE HEAVY CURTAIN BLEW OUT A LITTLE HE TURNED AND HALF OPENED HIS EYES THE WIND ACTUALLY STIRRED THE CLOTH ON THE CHEST OF DRAWERS AND LET IN A LITTLE LIGHT SO THAT THE SHARP EDGE OF THE CHEST OF DRAWERS WAS VISIBLE
IT IS FIFTEEN MINUTES PAST THE HOUR BUT MADE NO ANSWER UNLESS A BRAMBLE STIRRED YET EVEN IN THIS LIGHT THE LEGENDS ON THE TOMBSTONES COULD BE READ BRIEF VOICES SAYING I AM BERTHA RUCK
I HAD ALL SHAKESPEARE BY HEART BEFORE I WAS IN MY TEENS MISTER SALVIN YOU DON'T SAY SO SAID MISTER SALVIN BUT I DO SAID LADY HIBBERT OH MISTER SALVIN I'M SO SORRY
MORE HORSES LEGS HAVE BEEN WORN OUT MORE COACHMEN'S LIVES CONSUMED MORE HOURS OF SOUND AFTERNOON TIME VAINLY LAVISHED THAN SERVED TO WIN US THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AND PAY FOR IT INTO THE BARGAIN
NOTHING WAS SAID A MAN WHEELED A TROLLEY PAST JACOB'S LEGS SO NEAR THAT HE ALMOST GRAZED THEM WHEN JACOB RECOVERED HIS BALANCE THE OTHER TWO WERE TURNING AWAY THOUGH JINNY LOOKED OVER HER SHOULDER

THE SHADOW OF ARCHER HER ELDEST SON FELL ACROSS THE NOTEPAPER AND LOOKED BLUE ON THE SAND AND SHE FELT CHILLY IT WAS THE THIRD OF SEPTEMBER ALREADY IF JACOB DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY
SAID MALLINSON FLICKING AT HIS BALD HEAD WHAT DO THEY TAKE ME FOR SOMETHING SWEET SMELLING SAID CRUTTENDON SHUT UP CRUTTENDON SAID JACOB THE FELLOW HAS NO MANNERS
CLASPED BY CRUTTENDON'S ARMS OR SHE WOULD HAVE FALLEN IN THERE THERE SHE CRIED RIGHT UP TO THE TOP SOME SLUGGISH SLOPING SHOULDERED FISH HAD FLOATED UP FROM THE DEPTHS TO NIP HER CRUMBS YOU LOOK
THE VOICE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY SADNESS PURE FROM ALL BODY PURE FROM ALL PASSION GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD SOLITARY UNANSWERED BREAKING AGAINST ROCKS SO IT SOUNDED STEELE FROWNED BUT WAS PLEASED BY THE EFFECT OF THE BLACK IT WAS JUST THAT NOTE WHICH BROUGHT THE REST TOGETHER
IF YOU GO TO HIS STUDIO HE'LL GIVE YOU ONE OF HIS PICTURES I SAY TEDDY HALF A JIFF SAID CRUTTENDON WHAT'S THE SEASON OF THE YEAR HE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW WE TAKE A DAY OFF ON SUNDAYS FLANDERS
NOBODY SHALL DISTURB YOU SAID MISSUS DURRANT PEREMPTORILY AS SHE PASSED JULIA ELIOT IT IS JULIA ELIOT SAID OLD LADY HIBBERT HOLDING OUT BOTH HER HANDS AND MISTER SALVIN WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO US MISTER SALVIN
THIS ASTONISHING AGITATION AND VITALITY OF COLOUR WHICH STIRRED BETTY FLANDERS AND MADE HER THINK OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DANGER SHE GRIPPED ARCHER'S HAND ON SHE PLODDED UP THE HILL WHAT DID I ASK YOU TO REMEMBER SHE SAID
THAT NOTHING IN THE WORLD WAS OF GREATER IMPORTANCE AND AS FOR CRUTTENDON AND JINNY HE THOUGHT THEM THE MOST REMARKABLE PEOPLE HE HAD EVER MET BEING OF COURSE UNABLE TO FORESEE HOW IT FELL OUT IN THE COURSE OF TIME THAT CRUTTENDON TOOK TO PAINTING ORCHARDS
HAD THEREFORE TO LIVE IN KENT AND MUST ONE WOULD THINK SEE THROUGH APPLE BLOSSOM BY THIS TIME SINCE HIS WIFE FOR WHOSE SAKE HE DID IT ELOPED WITH A NOVELIST BUT NO
THERE IS NO REASON TO DOUBT THAT CHARLES JAMES FOX MISTER BURLEY BEGAN BUT HERE MISSUS STRETTON TOLD HIM THAT SHE KNEW HIS SISTER WELL HAD STAYED WITH HER NOT SIX WEEKS AGO AND THOUGHT THE HOUSE CHARMING
SANG ELSBETH SIDDONS AH CLARA EXCLAIMED OUT LOUD AND CLAPPED HER GLOVED HANDS AND JACOB CLAPPED HIS BARE ONES AND THEN SHE MOVED FORWARD AND DIRECTED PEOPLE TO COME IN FROM THE DOORWAY
BUT THAT LETTER WRITING IS PRACTISED MENDACIOUSLY NOWADAYS PARTICULARLY BY YOUNG MEN TRAVELLING IN FOREIGN PARTS
DESPAIR AND TRIUMPH BUT FOR THE MOST PART GOOD SENSE AND JOLLY INDIFFERENCE GO TRAMPLING OUT OF THE WINDOWS ANY TIME THESE FIVE HUNDRED YEARS STILL AS MISSUS JARVIS SAID STEPPING OUT ON TO THE MOORS
THINK OF THE FAIRIES SAID BETTY FLANDERS THINK OF THE LOVELY LOVELY BIRDS SETTLING DOWN ON THEIR NESTS NOW SHUT YOUR EYES AND SEE THE OLD MOTHER BIRD WITH A WORM IN HER BEAK NOW TURN AND SHUT YOUR EYES SHE MURMURED AND SHUT YOUR EYES
BUT AT MIDNIGHT WHEN NO ONE SPEAKS OR GALLOPS AND THE THORN TREE IS PERFECTLY STILL
THE LITTLE DEMONS ARE THE SOURCE OF AS MANY REPRIEVES CALAMITIES AND ANXIETIES AS THE BATTLE ITSELF SOMETIMES MISSUS BONHAM HAS JUST GONE OUT AT OTHERS SHE IS AT HOME
SHE WOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY GLAD TO SEE ONE MAN I KNOW THIS IN THIS TREATMENT OF THE OLD WOMAN I SEE HER REQUEST THAT YOU WILL GO AND SEE HER DURING THE COMING DARK FORTNIGHT
I WILL JUMP DOWN AND RECONNOITRE YOU STAY HERE AND WAIT TILL I RETURN PRESENTLY HE CAME BACK AND TOLD THE PRINCE THAT HE HAD SEEN A MOST UGLY WOMAN
I AM GOING TO SEE MY DAUGHTER
PERHAPS THE DOG KNEW SOMETHING OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE THINGS AND ADVISED THE MERCHANT TO FOLLOW ITS LEADINGS THE MERCHANT CONSENTED AND WENT AFTER THE DOG RIGHT UP TO THE VERY PLACE WHERE THE THIEVES HAD HIDDEN THE GOODS
THAT BELONGED TO AN OLD WOMAN FROM WHOM THEY FEARED NO HARM AND WITH WHOM THEREFORE THEY COULD ABIDE IN PEACE AND COMFORT AT FIRST THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF THESE TRAVELLERS
ONE OF THEM ESPECIALLY APPEARS VERY STUPID HE ASKED ME THE NAME OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE NAME OF THE KING NOW WHERE CAN THESE MEN HAVE COME FROM THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW THESE THINGS HOWEVER
WHENCE HE HAD COME WHY HE HAD COME AND WHAT WAS HIS CASTE TO WHICH HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS A BRAHMAN AND WAS WANDERING HITHER AND THITHER BEGGING A LIVELIHOOD FOR HIMSELF AND WIFE AND PARENTS
RETURNED AND FOUND THE FIRE LIGHTED THE HORSES SECURELY FASTENED
LEAVING THE DOG AS A PLEDGE AND WITH THE MONEY BEGAN BUSINESS AGAIN
EXCLAIMED THE KING WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT FROM THE COMMENCEMENT WHAT EXAMPLES FOR THE PEOPLE LET THEM BOTH BE EXECUTED NOT SO YOUR MAJESTY
AND THE BEST PROVISIONS SET BEFORE HIM AH THOUGHT HE AS HE LAY DOWN TO REST
SO THE PRINCESS GAVE ME THIS CHARMED SWING TO RETURN IN BUT COME LET US GET OUTSIDE BEFORE THE ELEPHANTS ARRIVE AND BATTER DOWN THE PLACE DON'T BELIEVE THIS SAID THE VIZIER'S SON IT IS A MERE HOAX
SENDS YOU AN OFFERING IN THE NAME OF HER DEAD UNCLE ON RECEIVING THE PRESENT
AND THE VIZIER'S SON ATTENDED BY A TROOP OF SOLDIERS AND A LARGE NUMBER OF CAMELS AND HORSES BEARING VERY MUCH TREASURE LEFT FOR THEIR OWN LAND
IN THE NAME OF HER DECEASED UNCLE IT IS SATURATED WITH POISON THANK HEAVEN I DISCOVERED IT IN TIME OH BROTHER WHO COULD HAVE DONE THIS THING WHO IS THERE THAT ENTERTAINS ENMITY AGAINST YOU
TO MANAGE TO COME AND REST AT THEIR HOUSE WHERE THE WHOLE FAMILY ATTACKED THEM AND STOLE THEIR GOODS THESE THIEVES LIVED IN A KIND OF TOWER WHICH HAD SEVERAL STRONG ROOMS IN IT AND UNDER IT
WHERE HE FOUND HIM LYING TO ALL APPEARANCE DEAD ALAS ALAS HE CRIED AND LIFTING UP THE PRINCE HE POURED SOME WATER OVER HIS HEAD AND FACE ALAS
WHOM HE SUPPOSED WAS THE ROBBERS HOUSEKEEPER SHE HAD AGREED TO RELEASE THEM ON THE PROMISE OF HER MARRIAGE WITH THE PRINCE
WENT TO THE BANIYA AND THE BAKER AND THE BUTCHER TO GET SOMETHING FOR THEIR DINNER FOR SOME REASON HE WAS DELAYED PERHAPS THE TSUT WAS NOT QUITE READY OR THE BANIYA
HE DISGUISED HIMSELF AS A JOGI
PRETENDED TO BE ABSORBED IN WORSHIP NEWS OF THE MAN AND OF HIS WONDERFUL PIETY REACHED THE EARS OF THE KING HE FELT INTERESTED IN HIM AS HIS WIFE WAS VERY ILL AND HE HAD SOUGHT FOR HAKIMS
NOT TO SPEAK ABOUT THEM AT THE PALACE HOPING THAT BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN TOLD NOT TO DO SO SHE WOULD MENTION THEIR ARRIVAL AND THUS THE PRINCESS WOULD BE INFORMED OF THEIR COMING ON SEEING HER MOTHER
I HAVE NOT HAD SUFFICIENT TIME TO RECOVER MYSELF FROM MY RECENT LOSSES I WILL SLAY THE DOG ERE HE REACHES THE THRESHOLD AND SAY THAT ANOTHER MUST HAVE SLAIN IT THUS THERE WILL BE AN END OF MY DEBT NO DOG NO LOAN
BURN ON HER BACK GO AND IF IT IS AS I SAY SEND THE PRINCESS TO ME AND I WILL PUNISH HER
AND TO ACCEPT ANOTHER FIVE THOUSAND RUPEES AS A PRESENT WHEN THIS MERCHANT SAW HIS DOG COMING BACK AGAIN HE THOUGHT ALAS MY FRIEND IS WANTING THE MONEY HOW CAN I PAY HIM
AND THE SERVANTS CAME RUNNING UPSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER IT HAPPENED THAT THE WOMAN HAD FAINTED AND THAT THERE WAS ONLY A VERY SLIGHT WOUND IN HER BREAST WHERE THE ARROW HAD GRAZED
SHE WILL RECEIVE HIM FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT SHE CAN OBTAIN FROM HIM BUT IF HE COMES TO HER IN POVERTY SHE WILL FROWN ON HIM AND DISOWN HIM THIRDLY IF A MAN HAS TO DO ANY WORK
AND HOW THE PRINCESS HAD STRUCK HER BECAUSE SHE MENTIONED THEIR COMING AND ALL ABOUT THEM
LET US SEND HER TO THE FAKIR WHO DISCOVERED THIS THING THAT HE MAY DO WHATEVER HE WISHES WITH HER THE KING AGREED AND SO THE PRINCESS WAS TAKEN TO THE GRAVEYARD LET HER BE SHUT UP IN A CAGE
AT THE PRINCE AND HIS COMPANIONS AND ONE OF THE ARROWS KILLED THE WOMAN SO THEY HAD TO LEAVE HER BEHIND ON ON THEY RODE UNTIL THEY REACHED A VILLAGE WHERE THEY STAYED THE NIGHT
SHOWED THE PRINCESS SOME OF THE POISONED PILAW THAT SHE HAD SENT HIM
SO THE MERCHANT AND HIS FRIENDS DUG ABOUT THE PLACE AND SOON CAME UPON ALL THE STOLEN PROPERTY NOTHING WAS MISSING THERE WAS EVERYTHING JUST AS THE THIEVES HAD TAKEN THEM THE MERCHANT WAS VERY GLAD
AND BE KEPT NEAR THE GRAVE WHENCE SHE TOOK OUT THE CORPSE SAID THE FAKIR THIS WAS DONE AND IN A LITTLE WHILE THE FAKIR AND HIS DISCIPLE AND THE PRINCESS
THEN I FAINTED OH IF YOU CAN GET ME THAT FAIRY FOR MY WIFE I WILL GO ANYWHERE WITH YOU OH BROTHER
OH SHE CRIED I THOUGHT THAT BOTH OF YOU WOULD BE KILLED BY THIS TIME THE ROYAL ELEPHANTS HAVE GOT LOOSE AND ARE RUNNING ABOUT WILDLY WHEN I HEARD THIS I WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU
ALL THE NIGHT AND SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT HE SAW TWO SHAHMARS COME OUT FROM THE NOSTRILS OF THE PRINCESS THEY STOLE OVER TOWARDS HIM INTENDING TO KILL HIM LIKE THE OTHERS WHO HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM
AND ORDERED HER TO RUSH INTO THE ROOM WHILE SHE WAS CONVERSING WITH THE OLD WOMAN AND IF THE OLD WOMAN ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER
BY A SECRET DOOR BUT WHERE ARE THE HORSES AND THE GOODS
AND THE WOMAN LEFT ON THIS SCRAP OF PAPER WERE WRITTEN THREE PIECES OF ADVICE FIRST IF A PERSON IS TRAVELLING AND REACHES ANY STRANGE PLACE AT NIGHT LET HIM BE CAREFUL WHERE HE PUTS UP
OR SICKNESS ATTACK HIM AND THEN SHE WOULD BE DEPRIVED OF HIM SHE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT SEEING HIM THE PRINCE SHOWED HER THAT THERE WAS NO REAL CAUSE FOR FEAR AND SAID THAT HE FELT HE OUGHT TO RETURN TO HIS FRIEND AT NIGHT
SINCE THEY HAD LEFT THEIR COUNTRY WHEN THE VIZIER READ THE LETTER HE WENT AND INFORMED THE KING THE KING CAUSED A REPLY TO BE SENT TO THE TWO EXILES IN WHICH HE ORDERED THEM NOT TO RETURN
UPON OUR EYES AND WE SHALL SEE AGAIN
A ROYAL PROCLAMATION WAS ISSUED TO THIS EFFECT SO THE NEXT DAY ALL THE MEN AND BOYS OF THE CITY FROM THE AGE OF TEN YEARS UPWARDS
THE SOURCE WAS A BEAUTIFUL LAKE WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS COVERED WITH THE MAGNIFICENT LOTUS FLOWER AND OTHER WATER PLANTS THE PRINCE SAT DOWN ON THE BANK AND BEING THIRSTY
THE PRINCE SHOULD BE BANISHED FROM THE COUNTRY THIS WAS FINALLY AGREED TO ACCORDINGLY ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING A LITTLE COMPANY OF SOLDIERS ESCORTED THE PRINCE OUT OF THE CITY
HE ORDERED THE EXECUTION OF SOME OF THE VIZIERS ON A CERTAIN DATE COME HE WROTE BACK TO THE VIZIER'S SON AND STAY AT THE PALACE
LET THE FACTS OF THE CASE BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED HOW IS IT
THE KING WISHED BOTH OF THEM TO BE EXECUTED
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A WEALTHY MERCHANT WHO HAD A PET DOG HE WAS SUDDENLY REDUCED TO POVERTY AND HAD TO PART WITH HIS DOG HE GOT A LOAN OF FIVE THOUSAND RUPEES FROM A BROTHER MERCHANT
BEGGED THEM TO COME AND STAY AT THEIR HOUSE FOR THE NIGHT IT IS LATE THEY SAID AND THERE IS NOT ANOTHER VILLAGE WITHIN SEVERAL MILES SHALL WE ACCEPT THIS GOOD MAN'S INVITATION BROTHER ASKED THE PRINCE
QUICKLY MADE HER CHANGE HER MIND SHE AGREED TO LET THEM STAY THERE FOR A FEW DAYS AS SOON AS HER WORK WAS OVER THE OLD WOMAN CAME AND SAT DOWN WITH HER LODGERS
THE KING WAS VERY ANGRY WHEN HE HEARD OF THE THEFT AND CAUSED PROCLAMATION CONCERNING IT TO BE MADE THROUGHOUT ALL THE CITY AND SURROUNDING COUNTRY IT IS WELL SAID THE VIZIER'S SON WHEN HE HEARD OF THIS PROCLAMATION
DISMISSED HIM THE NEXT MORNING THE BRAHMANI TOOK THE PAPER AND WHILE SHE WAS GOING ALONG THE ROAD TO THE DARBAR READING IT THE KING'S SON MET HER AND ASKED WHAT SHE WAS READING WHEREUPON SHE REPLIED
I AM THE SON OF A KING WHO RULES OVER SUCH AND SUCH A COUNTRY WHEN HE HEARD THIS THE KING WAS VERY GLAD AND BADE THE PRINCE TO ABIDE IN HIS PALACE AND APPOINTED HIM HIS SUCCESSOR TO THE THRONE
BECAUSE HE HAD LEFT HIS HOME AND COUNTRY AND RISKED HIS LIFE FOR HIM AND MOREOVER IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR HIS FRIEND'S HELP HE WOULD NEVER HAVE MET WITH HER
AND THERE THEY FOUND THE FAKIR WITH HIS EYES SHUT AND ENGAGED IN PRAYER PRESENTLY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS DEVOTIONS THE KOTWAL ASKED HIM
EVER BEEN BEFORE HENCEFORTH THE PRINCE VISITED
AND RETURNED TO THE HUT EVERY NIGHT ONE MORNING GULIZAR BEGGED HIM TO STAY WITH HER ALWAYS SHE WAS CONSTANTLY AFRAID OF SOME EVIL HAPPENING TO HIM PERHAPS ROBBERS WOULD SLAY HIM
AND WITH HIM THE KOTWAL WHO AT ONCE TOOK THE PRINCE INTO CUSTODY ON THE CHARGE OF STEALING THE PRINCESS'S NECKLACE HOW DID YOU GET THE NECKLACE THE KOTWAL ASKED A FAKIR
SAID THE PRINCE WHO HAD EAGERLY LISTENED TO EVERY WORD WHAT THEN WILL BE HER ANGER AT THE SIGHT OF A MAN ANGER SAID THE VIZIER'S SON
AND BEAT HER BACK WITH A SHOVEL WHICH LAY ON THE FIRE AT THE TIME WHILE RUNNING AWAY FROM ME HER NECKLACE GOT LOOSE AND DROPPED YOU WONDER AT THESE WORDS BUT THEY ARE NOT DIFFICULT TO PROVE
REMEMBERED HIM ACCORDINGLY HE SENT BACK HIS SALAM AND EXPRESSIONS OF THANKFULNESS WHEN IT WAS DINNER TIME HE TOOK THE SAUCEPAN OF PILAW
AND SHALL NEVER BE HAPPY WITHOUT YOU SO THE TWO FRIENDS WALKED ALONG HAND IN HAND AS FAST AS THEY COULD TO GET OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND BEHIND THEM MARCHED THE SOLDIERS AND THE HORSES
CHAFFING HIM BECAUSE HE HAD MISSED THE BIRD PRESENTLY THE MERCHANT WENT TO ASK HIS WIFE ABOUT SOMETHING AND FOUND HER LYING TO ALL APPEARANCE
SAW THAT THE PRINCE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SENDING OF THE PILAW AND THEREFORE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING LOOK HERE HE SAID IN THIS HANDKERCHIEF IS SOME PILAW THAT THE PRINCESS SENT ME THIS MORNING
AND PROMISED THAT THEY EACH WOULD GIVE HIM A DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE HE AGREED TO DO SO AND SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING THEIR PARDON THEN THE PRINCE
CARE YOU NOT WHETHER THEY CURSE ME AND I DIE GO BACK IMMEDIATELY AND AWAIT MY RETURN
BECAUSE ALL HER HUSBANDS DIE THE FIRST NIGHT OF THEIR STAY WITH HER NEARLY ALL THE YOUNG MEN OF THE PLACE HAVE THUS PERISHED AND OUR SON WILL BE CALLED ON SOON WE LAUGH AT THE ABSURDITY OF THE THING
THEY DID NOT HOWEVER GO VERY FAR BUT HID THEMSELVES BEHIND ROCKS AND STONES AND WAITED TILL THEY WERE QUITE SURE THAT THE PRINCE DID NOT INTEND TO COME BACK ON AND ON THE EXILES WALKED
EXAMINE YOUR DAUGHTER
CALL THE KING HITHER HE REPLIED AND THEN I WILL TELL HIS MAJESTY FACE TO FACE ON THIS SOME MEN WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM
THIS DONE RETURN NOW FEAR NOT TO EXECUTE THESE INSTRUCTIONS BECAUSE ON THE FULFILMENT OF THEM DEPENDS YOUR FORTUNE AND HAPPINESS I WILL ARRANGE THAT YOUR MARRIAGE WITH THE PRINCESS
AND REPEATING THE CHARM HE MADE THEM PASS THROUGH THE NARROW DOORWAY LIKE PIECES OF CLOTH AND WHEN THEY WERE ALL OUTSIDE RESTORED THEM
MY BROTHER WHAT IS THIS OH DO NOT DIE AND LEAVE ME THUS SPEAK SPEAK I CANNOT BEAR THIS IN A FEW MINUTES THE PRINCE REVIVED BY THE WATER
I WILL CLIMB TO THE WINDOW AND SEE WHETHER THERE ARE ANY MEANS OF ESCAPE YES YES HE WHISPERED WHEN HE HAD REACHED THE WINDOW HOLE
HAD OBTAINED A CHARMED SWING THAT LANDED WHOEVER SAT ON IT AT THE PLACE WHEREVER THEY WISHED TO BE GET THE SWING SHE SAID TO ONE OF THE SERVANTS STANDING BY WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT SHE BADE THE OLD WOMAN
WENT OUT TWO AND TWO AND WALKED ABOUT THE FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS THAT RAN THROUGH THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY ROBBING THOSE TRAVELLERS WHO COULD NOT RESIST THEM AND INVITING OTHERS WHO WERE TOO POWERFUL FOR TWO OF THEM
HAD NOT GOT ALL THE SPICES PREPARED AFTER WAITING
IN THE ATTITUDE OF A SUPPLICANT AND ASKED HOW DID YOU GET MY DAUGHTER'S NECKLACE LAST NIGHT REPLIED THE FAKIR WE WERE SITTING HERE BY THIS TOMB WORSHIPPING KHUDA
TOOK UP SOME OF THE WATER IN HIS HAND FORTUNATELY HE LOOKED INTO HIS HAND BEFORE DRINKING AND THERE TO HIS GREAT ASTONISHMENT HE SAW REFLECTED WHOLE AND CLEAR THE IMAGE OF A BEAUTIFUL
OF THESE ILLUSTRIOUS VISITORS AS HE WAS ESPECIALLY ANXIOUS TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF IN THE FAVOUR OF THE PRINCE
OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED ABOUT WILDLY THANK GOD EXCLAIMED
THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY LEFT THE VIZIERS AND OTHERS WHOM THE KING INTENDED TO HAVE EXECUTED AS SOON AS HIS VISITORS HAD LEFT
ON THE WAY HE HAD TO PASS THROUGH THE COUNTRY BELONGING TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW WHOM WE HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED REPORT OF HIS ARRIVAL REACHED THE EARS OF THE KING WHO CAME WITH ROPE TIED HANDS AND HALTERED NECK
TOLD HER PARENTS OF HER MEETING WITH HER HUSBAND AND WHAT A VALUABLE PIECE OF PAPER HE HAD GIVEN HER BUT NOT LIKING TO GO BEFORE THE KING HERSELF SHE SENT ONE OF HER RELATIONS
NOBODY THE OLD WOMAN REPLIED
AND WALKED ON DAY AFTER DAY TILL HE REACHED THE CHIEF CITY OF THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY HERE HE WENT AND SAT DOWN BY A MERCHANT'S SHOP AND ASKED ALMS THE MERCHANT INQUIRED
GO AWAY COME COME LET US LEAVE THIS PLACE LOOK I HAVE BROUGHT SOME FOOD FOR YOU AND HORSES AND EVERYTHING LET US EAT AND DEPART GO ALONE REPLIED THE PRINCE
DICTATION ON READING THE LETTER
TILL THEY ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN VILLAGE WHERE THEY DETERMINED TO SPEND THE NIGHT UNDER ONE OF THE BIG TREES OF THE PLACE THE PRINCE MADE PREPARATIONS FOR A FIRE AND ARRANGED THE FEW ARTICLES OF BEDDING THAT THEY HAD WITH THEM
HE LOOKED AROUND AS BEFORE AND THIS TIME DISCOVERED A FAIRY SITTING BY THE BANK ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE LAKE ON SEEING HER HE FELL SO MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER THAT HE DROPPED DOWN IN A SWOON
THEY ALSO SHALL GO OUT BY THIS DOOR I HAVE A CHARM WHEREBY I CAN MAKE THEM THIN OR FAT SO THE VIZIER'S SON FETCHED THE HORSES WITHOUT ANY PERSON KNOWING IT
LEST YOU DO THAT WHICH AFTERWARDS YOU WOULD GIVE YOUR LIFE NOT TO HAVE DONE BY THE TIME THE PRINCE HAD CONCLUDED THIS STORY IT WAS NEARLY MORNING AND HE WENT AWAY AFTER REWARDING THE MAN THE PRINCE THEN VISITED THE COUNTRY BELONGING TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW
THE FOLLOWING MORNING THEY WERE OFF AGAIN
BUT WHAT IS THE MATTER BROTHER GO AWAY REPLIED THE PRINCE
SHALL BE ACCEPTED BY THE KING HER FATHER AND ALL THE COURT THE PRINCE PROMISED THAT HE WOULD DO EVERYTHING AS THE VIZIER'S SON HAD ADVISED HIM AND HE KEPT HIS PROMISE THE FOLLOWING NIGHT ON THE RETURN OF THE PRINCE
AND TAKING A SWORD IN HIS HAND RUSHED TO THE PRINCE WITH THE INTENTION OF KILLING HIM BUT HE ROSE UP AND SPOKE DO NOT SLAY ME HE SAID WHAT PROFIT WOULD YOU GET FROM MY DEATH IF YOU KILLED ME YOU WOULD BE SORRY AFTERWARDS
HE MOST HUMBLY BEGGED HIM TO STAY AT HIS PALACE AND TO ACCEPT WHAT LITTLE HOSPITALITY COULD BE PROVIDED WHILE THE PRINCE WAS STAYING AT THE PALACE HE SAW HIS SISTER WHO GREETED HIM WITH SMILES AND KISSES ON LEAVING
TO ANY BEGGAR WHO CHOSE TO GO FOR IT ACCORDINGLY ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING SHE WENT TO THE PLACE AND MET HER HUSBAND WHY HAVE YOU COME HERE HE ASKED WHY HAVE YOU LEFT MY PARENTS
AND SUCH A CITY AS THIS HAS A NAME WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS CITY IVORY CITY DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I THOUGHT THE NAME WAS KNOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD ON THE MENTION OF THE NAME IVORY CITY
BUT NO PRINCE HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK HE WAITED A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SHOUTED
THERE WAS HARDLY TEN RUPEES WORTH LEFT IN THE PLACE THE FAITHFUL DOG HOWEVER KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WENT AND FOLLOWED THE THIEVES AND SAW WHERE THEY DEPOSITED THE THINGS AND THEN RETURNED
THE GREEN GRASS UNDER THE COVER OF THE SAUCEPAN TURNED QUITE YELLOW HE WAS ASTONISHED AND SUSPECTING THAT THERE WAS POISON IN THE PILAW HE TOOK A LITTLE AND THREW IT TO SOME CROWS THAT WERE HOPPING ABOUT
THEY ARE VERY GREAT AND VERY RICH
RUBBED SOME OINTMENT OVER THE SCARS ON HER BACK AND THEN SAT HER UPON ONE OF THEIR HORSES BEHIND THE PRINCE AWAY THEY RODE FAST AND FAR AND BY THE MORNING
IMPATIENT AND ROSE UP AND WALKED ABOUT HE SAW A PRETTY CLEAR LITTLE BROOK RUNNING ALONG NOT FAR FROM THEIR RESTING PLACE AND HEARING THAT ITS SOURCE WAS NOT FAR DISTANT HE STARTED OFF TO FIND IT
CLAD IN HIS OWN CLOTHES THE PRINCE WAS WALKING ALONG ONE DAY WHEN HE SAW A POTTER CRYING AND LAUGHING ALTERNATELY WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN
HIS MAJESTY WAS VERY GLAD THEREFORE WHEN HE SAW THE BRAHMAN AND HEARD THAT HE WAS GOOD AND HONEST HE AT ONCE DEPUTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF THIS TEMPLE AND ORDERED FIFTY KHARWARS OF RICE
YOU CANNOT BRING THEM THE WOMAN SAID TO GO OUT BY ANY OTHER WAY WOULD BE TO THRUST ONESELF INTO THE GRAVE ALL RIGHT THEN
THOUGHT THAT THE PRINCE HAD SPOKEN GRATEFULLY OF HIM TO THE PRINCESS
CONSEQUENTLY NOT KNOWING WHAT HAD HAPPENED
AND THE PURCHASE OF THE PIECE OF PAPER
THESE TWO MEN BELONGED TO A FAMILY OF ROBBERS THERE WERE ELEVEN OF THEM ALTOGETHER ONE AN ELDER SISTER STAYED AT HOME AND COOKED THE FOOD AND THE OTHER TEN ALL BROTHERS
AND DO IT WITH MIGHT AND WITHOUT FEAR
THE GIRL PRETENDED TO BE VERY ANGRY WHY HAVE YOU NOT BEEN FOR TWO DAYS SHE ASKED BECAUSE MY DEAR THE OLD WOMAN ANSWERED TWO YOUNG TRAVELLERS
SHE FELT A SMARTING PAIN IN HER BACK AND NOTICED THAT HER PEARL NECKLACE WAS GONE SHE WENT AT ONCE AND INFORMED THE KING OF THE LOSS OF HER NECKLACE BUT SAID NOTHING TO HIM ABOUT THE PAIN IN HER BACK
WHERE SHE HEARD THAT EVERY MORNING AT THE GOLDEN TEMPLE
THROWING HIS ARMS ROUND THE PRINCE'S NECK BECAUSE I CANNOT LET YOU GO ALONE WE HAVE LIVED TOGETHER WE WILL BE EXILED TOGETHER AND WE WILL DIE TOGETHER TURN ME NOT BACK IF YOU LOVE ME CONSIDER
THEY HAVE BEEN PLAYING TRICKS WITH YOU YOU WILL SOON HAVE YOUR HEART'S DESIRE
THAT HAD BEEN BURIED A FEW DAYS AGO AND BEGAN TO EAT IT ON SEEING THIS
OF COURSE THERE IS AND A QUEEN AND A PRINCESS WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES
WHEN THE KING HEARD THIS HE WAS VERY ANGRY AND ORDERED THE JOGI TO BE EXECUTED THIS STERN ORDER HOWEVER WAS NOT CARRIED OUT AS THE PRINCE BRIBED THE MEN AND ESCAPED FROM THE COUNTRY BUT HE KNEW THAT THE SECOND BIT OF ADVICE WAS TRUE
HE AT ONCE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND LAID HOLD OF THE HALTER OF ONE OF THE OTHER HORSES AND THEN BECKONING TO THE PRINCE TO DO LIKEWISE HE RODE OFF THE PRINCE
WERE ALSO IN THE COMPANY AND PASSED BY IN THE CROWD THEY CAME TO SEE THE TAMASHA AS SOON AS THESE TWO APPEARED IN FRONT OF THE MERCHANT'S WINDOW THEY WERE RECOGNISED
HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE PRINCE EXCLAIMED THE NEXT TIME THE OLD WOMAN WENT TO THE PALACE
AND AT ONCE ORDERED THE PRINCESS'S BACK TO BE EXAMINED IT IS SO SAID THE MAID SERVANT THE BURN IS THERE THEN LET THE GIRL BE SLAIN IMMEDIATELY THE KING SHOUTED NO NO YOUR MAJESTY THEY REPLIED
WE SHALL SEE THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS ONE MORNING THE TWO TRAVELLERS NOTICED THE OLD WOMAN'S MOST CAREFUL TOILETTE HOW CAREFUL SHE WAS IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF HER HAIR AND THE SET OF HER
TALKING GAILY TOGETHER SURELY SAID HE THIS MAN MUST BE HER HUSBAND AS HE ONLY CAN LIVE WITH HER WHERE DO YOU COME FROM WHO ARE YOU ASKED THE KING ENTERING THE ROOM O KING REPLIED THE PRINCE
REMEMBER TO BRING BACK THE SHOVEL AGAIN
LIKE THAT MAN WHO KILLED HIS DOG WHAT MAN WHAT DOG HE ASKED I WILL TELL YOU SAID THE PRINCE IF YOU WILL GIVE ME THAT SWORD SO HE GAVE HIM THE SWORD AND THE PRINCE BEGAN HIS STORY
WHEN THE PILAW WAS READY SHE SENT IT AT ONCE
HAVE TAKEN UP THEIR ABODE IN MY HUT AND DEMAND SO MUCH OF MY ATTENTION IT IS NOTHING BUT COOKING AND CLEANING AND CLEANING AND COOKING ALL DAY LONG I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THE MEN SHE ADDED
DO NOT BOTHER ME SAID THE POTTER WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO YOU PARDON ME SAID THE PRINCE BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE REASON THE REASON IS THIS THEN SAID THE POTTER THE KING OF THIS COUNTRY HAS A DAUGHTER
AND THE NAME OF THE QUEEN THE VIZIER'S SON INTERRUPTED THE OLD WOMAN BY TURNING TO LOOK AT THE PRINCE WHO WAS STARING LIKE A MADMAN YES HE SAID TO HIM AFTERWARDS WE ARE IN THE RIGHT COUNTRY
THE MOMENT THE CROWS ATE WHAT WAS THROWN TO THEM THEY FELL DOWN DEAD HEAVEN BE PRAISED EXCLAIMED THE VIZIER'S SON WHO HAS PRESERVED ME FROM DEATH AT THIS TIME ON THE RETURN OF THE PRINCE THAT EVENING
THESE THINGS ARE SIGNS
SEATED IN A ROOM WITH THE DOOR FASTENED ON THE OUTSIDE THE TWO TRAVELLERS BEMOANED THEIR FATE IT IS NO GOOD GROANING
AND NOT CLOSE HIS EYES IN SLEEP LEST HE CLOSE THEM IN DEATH SECONDLY IF A MAN HAS A MARRIED SISTER
BUT HE WAS READY FOR THEM HE LAID HOLD OF HIS SWORD AND WHEN THE SNAKES REACHED HIS BED HE STRUCK AT THEM AND KILLED THEM IN THE MORNING THE KING CAME AS USUAL TO INQUIRE AND WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR HIS DAUGHTER AND THE PRINCE
AND ORDERED HER TO MANAGE SOMEHOW OR OTHER FOR THE OLD PEOPLE DURING THE FEW MONTHS THAT HE WOULD BE ABSENT HE BEGGED HER TO BE INDUSTRIOUS LEST HIS PARENTS SHOULD BE ANGRY AND CURSE HIM ONE MORNING HE STARTED WITH SOME FOOD IN A BUNDLE
AND RODE ON THE POOR BRAHMANI WAS VERY THANKFUL THAT DAY SHE LAID IN A GREAT STORE OF PROVISIONS SUFFICIENT TO LAST THEM ALL FOR A LONG TIME IN THE EVENING THE PRINCE RELATED TO HIS FATHER THE MEETING WITH THE WOMAN
AS WAGES TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS THE BRAHMAN'S WIFE NOT HAVING HEARD ANY NEWS OF HER HUSBAND LEFT THE HOUSE AND WENT IN QUEST OF HIM BY A HAPPY FATE
AND SWORE THAT MOST TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT SHOULD BE VISITED ON THE OFFENDER IF HE COULD BE DISCOVERED HE ORDERED THE MERCHANT TO GO BACK AND ASCERTAIN WHETHER HIS WIFE COULD RECOGNISE THE YOUNG MEN
AT NIGHTFALL HE ARRIVED AT SOME PLACE WHERE A MAN MET HIM AND INVITED HIM TO LODGE AT HIS HOUSE THE PRINCE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND WAS TREATED LIKE A PRINCE MATTING WAS SPREAD FOR HIM TO SQUAT ON
THE KING GAVE THEM PRESENTS OF HORSES AND ELEPHANTS AND JEWELS AND RICH CLOTHS AND BADE THEM START FOR THEIR OWN LAND FOR HE WAS SURE THAT THE KING WOULD NOW RECEIVE THEM
A PRINCE AND THE SON
THE PRINCESS WEPT AND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE WAS HER GREATEST HELPER AND FRIEND A LETTER WAS SENT TO THE CHIEF VIZIER TELLING HIM OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE PRINCE
AS SHE STOOD BY THE WINDOW ON HEARING THIS THE MERCHANT WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE HIS MAJESTY WAS MUCH ENRAGED AT SUCH AUDACIOUS WICKEDNESS
SAW HIS OPPORTUNITY AND IN A MOMENT WAS RIDING AFTER HIM HAVING THE WOMAN BEHIND HIM NOW THE ROBBERS HEARD THE GALLOPING OF THE HORSES AND RAN OUT AND SHOT THEIR ARROWS
THERE HE CAME ACROSS THE FOOTMARKS OF HIS FRIEND SEEING THESE HE WENT BACK AT ONCE FOR THE MONEY AND THE HORSES AND BRINGING THEM WITH HIM HE TRACKED THE PRINCE TO THE LAKE
WHEN THE PRINCE HEARD THESE ENCOURAGING WORDS HE FELT MUCH COMFORTED ROSE UP AND ATE AND THEN WENT AWAY GLADLY WITH HIS FRIEND ON THE WAY THEY MET TWO MEN
AFTERWARDS HE WENT TO HIS OWN HOME AND INFORMED HIS MOTHER AND FATHER OF HIS ARRIVAL ALAS HIS PARENTS HAD BOTH BECOME BLIND FROM WEEPING ABOUT THE LOSS OF THEIR SON LET HIM COME IN SAID THE KING AND PUT HIS HANDS
WERE DEPENDENT ON THEIR SON FOR THEIR SUBSISTENCE EVERY DAY THE YOUNG FELLOW USED TO GO OUT AND GET WHAT HE COULD BY BEGGING THIS CONTINUED FOR SOME TIME
WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS CRUEL THING I SHOT AN ARROW AT A BIRD THAT WAS SITTING ON THE SILL OF AN OPEN WINDOW IN YONDER HOUSE AND MISSED ANSWERED THE PRINCE
MY HUSBAND A THOUSAND THANKS TO HEAVEN FOR BRINGING ME TO YOU SAID THE PRINCE THEN THE PRINCE AND GULIZAR BETROTHED THEMSELVES TO ONE ANOTHER AND PARTED THE ONE FOR THE HUT
WHOSE SERVANT I AM GAVE IT TO ME TO SELL IN THE BAZAAR THE PRINCE REPLIED PERMIT ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU WHERE HE IS THE PRINCE DIRECTED THE KOTWAL AND THE POLICEMAN TO THE PLACE WHERE HE
THE KING WAS MORE ANGRY THAN BEFORE AND BANISHED HIS SON FROM THE COUNTRY SO THE PRINCE BADE ADIEU TO HIS MOTHER AND RELATIONS AND FRIENDS
I WILL EXCHANGE PLACES WITH YOUR SON AND WILL BE MARRIED TO THE PRINCESS INSTEAD OF HIM ONLY GIVE ME SUITABLE GARMENTS AND PREPARE ME FOR THE OCCASION
ACCORDINGLY HE RAN OUT AND KILLED THE POOR DOG WHEN THE LETTER FELL OUT OF ITS COLLAR THE MERCHANT PICKED IT UP AND READ IT HOW GREAT WAS HIS GRIEF AND DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN HE KNEW THE FACTS OF THE CASE BEWARE CONTINUED THE PRINCE
THE MERCHANT HIMSELF NEARLY WENT MAD MEANWHILE THE DOG KEPT ON RUNNING TO THE DOOR AND PULLING AT HIS MASTER'S SHIRT AND PAIJAMAS AS THOUGH WISHING HIM TO GO OUTSIDE AT LAST A FRIEND SUGGESTED THAT
DRESSED AS A PRINCESS
I SEE HER AND THE PRINCESS EVERY DAY I SHOULD HAVE GONE YESTERDAY IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN HERE AND TAKEN UP ALL MY TIME
THAT SHE HELD IN HER HANDS A PAPER CONTAINING CERTAIN BITS OF ADVICE FOR WHICH SHE WANTED A LAC OF RUPEES THE PRINCE ASKED HER TO SHOW IT TO HIM AND WHEN HE HAD READ IT
FAIRY HE LOOKED ROUND HOPING TO SEE THE REALITY BUT SEEING NO PERSON HE DRANK THE WATER AND PUT OUT HIS HAND TO TAKE SOME MORE AGAIN HE SAW THE REFLECTION IN THE WATER WHICH WAS IN HIS PALM
AS SOON AS THE WOMAN RECOVERED HER SENSES SHE TOLD THEM THAT TWO YOUNG MEN HAD PASSED BY THE PLACE WITH THEIR BOWS AND ARROWS AND THAT ONE OF THEM HAD MOST DELIBERATELY AIMED AT HER
ASSEMBLED AND MARCHED BY THE HOUSE OF THE MERCHANT BY CHANCE FOR THEY BOTH HAD BEEN EXCUSED FROM OBEYING THIS ORDER THE KING'S SON
PRETENDED TO BE UTTERLY IGNORANT OF THE PLACE AND PEOPLE HAS THIS CITY A NAME HE ASKED THE OLD WOMAN OF COURSE IT HAS YOU STUPID EVERY LITTLE VILLAGE MUCH MORE A CITY
I CANNOT GO BACK TO STARVE AND SEE YOUR OLD FATHER AND MOTHER DIE THERE IS NOT A GRAIN OF RICE LEFT IN THE HOUSE O BHAGAWANT EXCLAIMED THE BRAHMAN HERE TAKE THIS
IF SHE EVER AGAIN SPOKE OF THE STRANGERS BEFORE HER IN THE EVENING WHEN THE OLD WOMAN HAD RETURNED TO HER HUT SHE TOLD THE VIZIER'S SON HOW SORRY SHE WAS THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP BREAKING HER PROMISE
KASABAH AND PUTS WHO IS COMING
FEARING LEST THE ELEPHANTS SHOULD GO AND PUSH DOWN HER HUT AND KILL THE PRINCE AND HIS FRIEND BEGGED THE PRINCESS TO LET HER DEPART
AT NIGHT HE WAS CONDUCTED TO THE APARTMENT OF THE PRINCESS DREAD HOUR THOUGHT HE AM I TO DIE LIKE THE SCORES OF YOUNG MEN BEFORE ME HE CLENCHED HIS SWORD WITH FIRM GRIP AND LAY DOWN ON HIS BED INTENDING TO KEEP AWAKE
WITH THEIR VALUABLE BURDENS ON REACHING A PLACE ON THE BORDERS OF THE KING'S DOMINIONS THE PRINCE GAVE THE SOLDIERS SOME GOLD AND ORDERED THEM TO RETURN THE SOLDIERS TOOK THE MONEY AND LEFT
THEY RAZED IT TO THE GROUND SLEW ALL ITS INMATES AND SEIZED THE TREASURE WHICH THEY HAD BEEN AMASSING THERE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND WHEN THE KING SAW HIS SON'S BEAUTIFUL WIFE
SAYING THAT HIS DWELLING WAS THE OPEN AIR AND THAT IF HIS MAJESTY WISHED TO SEE HIM HE MUST COME HIMSELF AND BRING HIS WIFE TO THE PLACE THEN THE KING TOOK HIS WIFE AND BROUGHT HER TO THE JOGI
AFTER THIS THE OLD WOMAN WENT AND REPEATED ALMOST THE SAME WORDS TO THE PRINCESS ON THE HEARING OF WHICH THE PRINCESS BEAT HER SEVERELY AND THREATENED HER WITH A SEVERER PUNISHMENT
MOST GLADLY ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND RECEIVED A RIGHT NOBLE WELCOME FROM THE KING
HIS MAJESTY CAME AND SEEING THE FAKIR SO SOLEMN AND EARNEST IN HIS DEVOTIONS HE WAS AFRAID TO ROUSE HIS ANGER LEST PERADVENTURE THE DISPLEASURE OF HEAVEN SHOULD DESCEND ON HIM AND SO HE PLACED HIS HANDS TOGETHER
NIGHT HAD NOT LONG CAST ITS DARK MANTLE OVER THE SCENE WHEN THE FAKIR AND HIS DISCIPLE THREW OFF THEIR DISGUISE AND TAKING THEIR HORSES AND LUGGAGE APPEARED BEFORE THE CAGE THEY RELEASED THE PRINCESS
DISCIPLE AND SERVANT IN THE MORNING
HE TOLD HER HOW SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD TREATED HIM AT HIS FIRST VISIT AND HOW HE HAD ESCAPED AND THEN GAVE THEM TWO ELEPHANTS TWO BEAUTIFUL HORSES FIFTEEN SOLDIERS AND TEN LACS RUPEES WORTH OF JEWELS
THE HOLY MAN BADE HER PROSTRATE HERSELF BEFORE HIM AND WHEN SHE HAD REMAINED IN THIS POSITION FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS HE TOLD HER TO RISE AND GO FOR SHE WAS CURED IN THE EVENING THERE WAS GREAT CONSTERNATION IN THE PALACE BECAUSE
I SUPPOSE THE ARROW STRUCK THE MERCHANT'S WIFE HAD I KNOWN THAT SHE OR ANYBODY HAD BEEN NEAR
WE WILL SPEAK OF THIS LATER ON SAID THE KING ON HEARING THIS ANSWER DISMISS THE PEOPLE THEIR PRESENCE IS NO LONGER NEEDED IN THE EVENING
NEVER SAID THE VIZIER'S SON WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO SUDDENLY ESTRANGE YOU FROM ME A LITTLE WHILE AGO
A POTTER'S SON MARRYING A PRINCESS AND WE CRY AT THE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCE OF THE MARRIAGE WHAT CAN WE DO TRULY A MATTER FOR LAUGHING AND WEEPING BUT WEEP NO MORE SAID THE PRINCE
STAYING IN HER HOUSE BUT THE SIGHT OF A MUHR WHICH THE PRINCE DROPPED IN THE BOTTOM OF A CUP IN WHICH SHE HAD GIVEN HIM WATER AND A PRESENT OF ANOTHER MUHR
BUT THE PRINCE WAS TIRED AND THINKING THAT IT WAS ONLY A WHIM OF HIS FRIEND'S HE SAID TO THE MEN VERY WELL IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO ASK US SO THEY ALL FOUR WENT TO THE ROBBERS TOWER
FEAR NOT MY BROTHER BUT GO AND TAKE THIS NECKLACE AND TRY TO SELL IT IN THE BAZAAR THE PRINCE TOOK IT TO A GOLDSMITH AND ASKED HIM TO BUY IT HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT FOR IT ASKED THE MAN
TAKING THE HORSES AND BAGS OF MUHRS WENT TO A GRAVEYARD ABOUT A MILE OR SO DISTANT IT WAS ARRANGED THAT THE VIZIER'S SON
AND THEN ASKED PERMISSION TO VISIT HIS OWN COUNTRY WHICH WAS GRANTED THE KING GAVE HIM ELEPHANTS HORSES JEWELS AND ABUNDANCE OF MONEY FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE WAY AND AS PRESENTS FOR HIS FATHER AND THE PRINCE STARTED
WITHIN HALF A YARD OF HER HEAD SUPPOSING THAT SHE WAS DEAD HE RUSHED TO THE WINDOW AND SHRIEKED THIEVES THIEVES THEY HAVE KILLED MY WIFE THE NEIGHBOURS QUICKLY GATHERED
YOU HAVE HAD MISSUS WARDOUR REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT LETTY WAS FOR ABOUT A YEAR A DAY BOARDER AT A LADIES SCHOOL IN TESTBRIDGE WHERE NO IMMORTAL SOUL SAVE THAT OF A GENIUS
IN HER TURN SHE QUESTIONED JOSEPH AND LEARNED THAT AS SOON AS HE KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO SETTLE AT TESTBRIDGE HE STARTED OFF TO FIND IF POSSIBLE A PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HUMBLE ENOUGH TO BE WITHIN HIS REACH
AND FOLLOWED HER MISTRESS INTO HER ROOM I AM SORRY TO HAVE DISTURBED YOU MARY SAID HESPER HERSELF A LITTLE ANNOYED IT IS NOT QUITE EASY TO SAY WHY BUT PEOPLE DO NOT GENERALLY SAY THEIR PRAYERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
BY WHICH ALONE THE SOUL MOST GLORIOUS IN GLADNESS OR ANY OTHER THE STUPIDEST OF SOULS CAN LIVE TO THE FIRST HE BROUGHT HER SHE CONTRIVED TO PUT A POOR LITTLE FAULTY ACCOMPANIMENT AND WHEN SHE PLAYED HIS AIR TO HIM SO ACCOMPANIED
NEVER MAN MORE TO HER MIND IN HER WANDERINGS SHE HAD COME UPON THE BREACH IN THE HA HA AND CLAMBERING UP FOUND HERSELF ON THE FORBIDDEN GROUND OF A NEIGHBOR WHOM THE FAMILY DID NOT VISIT TO NO SUCH FOLLY WOULD SEPIA BE A VICTIM
MARY HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE BUT SOMETHING ABOUT HIM CAUSED HER TO LOOK AT HIM AGAIN AS HE PASSED SOMEHOW TOM ALSO HAD DISCOVERED SEPIA'S RETURN AND HAD GONE TO SEE HER MORE THAN ONCE
AND THE SAME MOMENT TO LOOK BEHIND HER THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT SHE FELL BUT SAFE IN THE SMITH'S ARMS THAT INSTANT APPEARED A MAN RUNNING HE HALF STOPPED AND TURNING FROM THE PATH TOOK TO THE COMMON
SHE FORGOT THAT THERE WAS A THING CALLED JOY SO SAD SHE LOOKED THAT THE GOOD WOMAN FULL OF PITY ASSURED HER THAT COME WHAT MIGHT
YOU ARE NOT A MAN MUST BE FAIR EVEN TO HIS WIFE I WILL SHOW YOU THE LETTER I WRITE IF YOU PLEASE SHE HAD TO SHOW HIM HALF A SCORE ERE HE WAS SATISFIED
FEARING THE WOMAN'S ACCUSATION MIGHT DO HER AN INJURY FELT COMPELLED TO INTERFERE MISS MARSTON SHE SAID SHE HAD JUST HEARD MISSUS TURNBULL USE HER NAME IF YOU SHOULD BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT BY YOUR EMPLOYER WILL YOU PLEASE REFER TO ME
SHE KNOCKED AT HIS DOOR AND BEING ADMITTED BADE HIM GOOD MORNING BUT WITH NO VERY GRACIOUS AIR AS INDEED HE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST TO EXPECT WE HAVE HAD A SERMON ON THE FORGIVENESS OF INJURIES MISTER REDMAIN SHE SAID
FOR LIKE MACBETH HE HAD BEGUN ALREADY TO CONSIDER LIFE BUT A POOR AFFAIR ACROSS THE CLOUD OF THIS DEATH GLEAMED CERTAINLY THE FLASHING OF SEPIA'S EYES OR THE SOFTLY INFOLDING DAWN OF HER SMILE
BUT ONLY THE NEXT HOUR NAY THE NEXT MOMENT TO LEAVE ALL DARKER THAN BEFORE PRECIOUS IS THE FAVOR OF ANY TRUE GOOD WOMAN BE SHE WHAT ELSE SHE MAY BUT WHAT IS THE FAVOR OF ONE WITHOUT HEART OR FAITH OR SELF GIVING
THE SAME EVENING TOM SAID TO LETTY PUTTING HIS THIN LONG HAND IN HERS MARY THINKS WE SHALL KNOW EACH OTHER THERE LETTY TOM INTERRUPTED LETTY
BUT THE DIGNITY OF HER REFUSAL WAS IN THIS THAT SHE WOULD ACCEPT NOTHING IN WHICH HER HUSBAND HAD AND COULD HAVE NO HUMAN THAT IS NO SPIRITUAL SHARE SHE HAD MARRIED HIM BECAUSE SHE LOVED HIM
THINKING NOTHING OF HIMSELF OR OF ANYTHING HE HAD DONE OR COULD DO HIS PATH WAS OPEN TO THE SWIFTEST AND HIGHEST GROWTH IT MATTERS LITTLE WHERE A MAN MAY BE AT THIS MOMENT THE POINT IS WHETHER HE IS GROWING
NOW GEORGE NEVER LOST A CHANCE OF RECOMMENDING HIMSELF TO MARY BY SIDING WITH HER BUT ONLY AFTER THE BATTLE HE CAME UP TO HER NOW WITH A MEAN UNPLEASANT LOOK INTENDED TO REPRESENT SYMPATHY AND APPROACHING HIS FACE TO HERS
THAT TOM'S MOTHER WAS FAR FROM ILLIBERAL TO HIM MISSUS HELMER ALLOWS HIM SO MUCH A YEAR DOES SHE NOT HE SAID I KNOW HE GETS MONEY FROM HER BUT IT CAN'T BE MUCH SHE ANSWERED
THE VISIBLE SIGN THAT ANOTHER WAS NEARER TO LETTY THAN HE SHE JUMPED UP ALMOST RAN INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND COMING BACK WITH HER LITTLE ONE LAID HIM IN GODFREY'S ARMS THE MOMENT HE FELT THE WEIGHT OF THE LITTLE SAD LOOKING SLEEPING THING
ANOTHER CHANGE FOR SOME TIME TOM MADE PROGRESS TOWARD HEALTH AND WAS ABLE TO READ A GOOD PART OF THE DAY
AND SAD WITH SUCH BIG EYES AND THE BONE TIGHTENING THE SKIN UPON HER FOREHEAD HE FELT AS IF SHE WERE A SPECTRE LETTY NOT THE LETTY HE HAD LOVED GLANCING UP SHE CAUGHT HIS TROUBLED GAZE
THE COURAGE OF LETTY BEGAN TO REVIVE A LITTLE THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF DOING ALL THAT OUGHT TO BE DONE HAD IN HER MISERABLE WEAKNESS SO DEPRESSED HER THAT SHE HAD NOT DONE EVEN AS MUCH AS SHE COULD EXCEPT WHERE TOM WAS IMMEDIATELY CONCERNED
THEN SHE WENT UP AND BEGAN TO MAKE THINGS AS COMFORTABLE AS SHE COULD ALL WAS IN SAD DISORDER AND NEGLECT WITH THE MERE INAUGURATION OF CLEANLINESS AND THE FIRST DAWN OF COMING ORDER
SOME THIEVES I DARE SAY CONSOLE THEMSELVES THAT THEY HAVE NEVER COMMITTED MURDER IF I HAD MARRIED A MAN I DID NOT LOVE ANSWERED MARY I SHOULD BE MORE ASHAMED OF MYSELF THAN I CAN TELL
SHE MUST WALK ALL THE WAY TO TESTBRIDGE SHE FELT WEAK BUT THE FRESH AIR WAS REVIVING SHE DID NOT KNOW THE WAY SO FAMILIARLY AS THAT BETWEEN THORNWICK AND THE TOWN BUT SHE WOULD ENTER THE LATTER BEFORE ARRIVING AT THE COMMON
HE WORE A NEW HAT AND WAS CLEAN SHAVED EXCEPT HIS UPPER LIP PRESENTLY A MAN CAME OUT OF THE MEWS IN A SCOTCH CAP AND A FULL BEARD WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM MISTER REDMAIN DID NOT CARE
IF WHAT FOLLOWED WAS NOT THE DOING OF THE REAL TOM IT WAS THE DOING OF THE DEVIL TO WHOM THE REAL TOM HAD OPENED THE DOOR WITH ONE STRIDE HE OVERTOOK HIS WIFE AND MOTHER AND CHILD LAY TOGETHER ON THE FLOOR I MUST SAY FOR HIM THAT
AND MARY HAD NEVER REQUIRED IT THE OTHERS BEHAVED TO HER AS TO ANY CUSTOMER KNOWN TO STAND UPON HER DIGNITY BUT SHE MADE THEM NO RETURN IN POLITENESS AND THE WAY SHE WOULD ORDER MARY NOW THERE WAS NO FATHER TO OFFEND
WHAT BECAME OF HER NONE OF HER FAMILY EVER LEARNED SOME TIME AFTER IT CAME OUT THAT THE SAME NIGHT ON WHICH THE PRESENCE OF JOSEPH RESCUED MARY FROM HER PURSUER A MAN SPEAKING WITH A FOREIGN ACCENT
HE HAD NO DESIRE TO PUNISH HIM IT WAS ENOUGH HE HAD FOUND HIM OUT PROVED HIS SUSPICION CORRECT AND OBTAINED EVIDENCE AGAINST SEPIA HE DID NOT AT ONCE MAKE UP HIS MIND HOW HE WOULD ACT ON THIS LAST
BUT SHE SOON LEARNED TO DROP ASLEEP AT ANY MOMENT AND WAKE IMMEDIATELY WHEN SHE WAS WANTED AND THEREAFTER HER STRENGTH WAS BY NO MEANS SO SORELY TRIED UNDER HER SKILLFUL NURSING
THE LATTER MADE A SLIGHT APOLOGY FOR HAVING SENT FOR HIM TO HIS STUDY CLAIMING THE PRIVILEGE HE SAID OF AN INVALID WHO COULD NOT FOR A TIME HAVE THE PLEASURE OF MEETING HIM EITHER AT THE CLUB OR AT HIS WIFE'S PARTIES
THERE SHE HAD NOT FAILED OF HER UTMOST MARY NEXT WENT TO THE DOCTOR TO GET INSTRUCTIONS AND THEN TO BUY WHAT THINGS WERE MOST WANTED AND NOW SHE ALMOST WISHED MISSUS REDMAIN HAD PAID HER FOR HER SERVICES
WHETHER THE CHANGE WAS CAUSED BY SOMETHING BETTER THAN PHYSICAL DECAY WHO KNOWS SAVE HIM WHO CAN USE EVEN DECAY FOR REDEMPTION HE LIVED TWO YEARS MORE AND DIED RATHER SUDDENLY AFTER HIS DEATH
PERHAPS THAT WILL BE TAKEN INTO THE ACCOUNT ONE DAY
WHO NOTWITHSTANDING HIS UNNEGLECTED OPPORTUNITIES HAD NOT BEEN TOO SUCCESSFUL TO ACCEPT AS A HUSBAND FOR HIS DAUGHTER SUCH A TRADESMAN AS JOHN TURNBULL SHE ARROGATED POSITION FROM HER IDEA OF HER FATHER'S POSITION AND
FOR THE MAN OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AT SUCH A CLOSE TO THE CONVERSATION THEY HAD BEEN HAVING SEPIA HAD BEEN TOLD THAT GALOFTA WAS IN THE STUDY AND THEREFORE RECEIVED THE SUMMONS THITHER A THING THAT HAD NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE WITH THE GREATER ALARM
HE TOOK IT THEREFORE AS A PIECE OF UTTER PRESUMPTION IN MARY TO WRITE TO HIM ABOUT LETTY AND THAT IN THE TONE AS HE INTERPRETED IT OF ONE READING HIM A LESSON OF DUTY BUT WHILE HE WAS THUS INDIGNANT WITH MARY
SHE WENT ON THAT A MAN IN DEBT NEVER TELLS THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS DEBTS AS IF HE HAD ONLY THE FACE TO MAKE THEM NOT TO TALK ABOUT THEM CAN YOU MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TOM I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
THE TIME FOR THAT DID NOT AGAIN ARRIVE BUT WHEN MARY WENT TO LONDON SHE ALWAYS CALLED ON HER AND GENERALLY SAW MISTER REDMAIN BUT THEY NEVER HAD ANY MORE TALK ABOUT THE THINGS MARY LOVED MOST
HE SAW PASS BETWIXT THEM THIS MAN SPOKE BOTH ENGLISH AND FRENCH WITH A FOREIGN ACCENT AND GAVE HIMSELF OUT AS A GEORGIAN COUNT GALOFTA HE CALLED HIMSELF I BELIEVE HE WAS A PRINCE IN PARIS AT THIS TIME HE WAS IN LONDON
COUNT GALOFTA THOUGHT IT WAS TO ORDER SOMETHING MORE IN THE WAY OF REFRESHMENT AND WAS NOT A LITTLE SURPRISED WHEN HE HEARD HIS HOST DESIRE THE MAN TO REQUEST THE FAVOR OF MISS YOLLAND'S PRESENCE BUT THE COUNT HAD NOT STUDIED NON EXPRESSION IN VAIN
MALIGN INFLUENCES INIMICAL TO THE VERY SPRINGS OF HER LIFE CONCENTRATED THEMSELVES UPON HER IT WAS THE DESIGN OF JOHN TURNBULL THAT SHE SHOULD NOT BE COMFORTABLE SO LONG AS SHE DID NOT IRREVOCABLY CAST IN HER LOT WITH HIS FAMILY
WOULD NEVER HAVE GROWN TO SUCH DIGNITY IT WAS INDEED ONLY IN THAT MOMENT SHE HAD BECOME CAPABLE OF THE ACTION SHE HAD BEEN GROWING AS NONE NOT MARY STILL LESS HERSELF KNEW UNDER THE HEAVY SNOWS OF AFFLICTION
WOULD HAVE DONE FAR MORE THAN ALL HIS INTELLECTUAL LABOR UPON HER TO LIFT HER FEET ABOVE SUCH SNARES AS SHE WAS NOW WALKING AMID SHE NEEDED SOME PLAY A THING FAR MORE IMPORTANT TO LIFE THAN A GREAT DEAL OF WHAT IS CALLED BUSINESS
WE DO NOT MISTER REDMAIN AND IF THIS OCCURS AGAIN I SHALL GO TO DURNMELLING SHE SPOKE WITH A VAGUE IDEA THAT HE ALSO STOOD IN SOME AWE OF THE FATHER AND MOTHER WHOSE DREAD HOWEVER WELL SHE HID IT SHE WOULD NEVER WHILE SHE LIVED SUCCEED IN SHAKING OFF
AS HIS WIFE WAS DOING SOME LITTLE THING FOR HIM HE TOOK HER HAND IN HIS FEEBLE GRASP AND PRESSING IT TO HIS FACE WET WITH THE TEARS OF REVIVING MANHOOD SAID WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAPPY TOGETHER LETTY
AND IMAGINATION THEREFORE WAS NOT VERY BUSY IN THE BOSOM OF GODFREY WARDOUR AS HE WENT TO FIND LETTY HELMER WHICH WAS JUST AS WELL IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES HE WAS COOL TO THE VERY HEART WHEN HE WALKED UP TO THE DOOR INDICATED BY MARY AND RUNG THE BELL MISSUS HELMER WAS AT HOME
IS IT STRANGE THAT ONE SO USED TO BAD COMPANY AND BAD WAYS SHOULD HAVE SO ALTERED IN SO SHORT A TIME AND WITHOUT ANY GREAT STRUGGLE
MORE AND MORE FATHERLY BUT THE MOTHER ONCE DISQUIETED HAD LOST NO TIME IN TAKING MEASURES IN EVERY DIRECTION SECRETLY THROUGH FRIENDS SHE WAS INQUIRING AFTER SOME SITUATION SUITABLE FOR LETTY
CRIED THE GRAND LADY BUT WHAT MORE SHE WOULD HAVE SAID I CAN NOT TELL FOR JUST THEN MISS MORTIMER RESUMED HER PLACE IN FRONT OF MARY SHE HAD NO IDEA OF HER POSITION IN THE SHOP NEITHER SUSPECTED WHO HER ASSAILANT WAS AND
NOT ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE EVER DONE REALLY MARY THIS IS INTOLERABLE CRIED HESPER I AM ONLY DOING WHAT YOU ASKED ME MA'AM SAID MARY AND I HAVE SAID NOTHING THAT EVERY ONE ABOUT MISTER REDMAIN DOES NOT KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
GEORGE CARRIED ON THE BUSINESS AND WHEN MARY AND HE HAPPENED TO PASS IN THE STREET THEY NODDED TO EACH OTHER LETTY WAS DILIGENT IN BUSINESS BUT IT NEVER GOT INTO HER HEART SHE CONTINUED TO BE MUCH LIKED
WHAT IF HELL BE JUST A PLACE WHERE GOD GIVES EVERYBODY EVERYTHING SHE WANTS AND LETS EVERYBODY DO WHATEVER SHE LIKES WITHOUT ONCE COMING NIGH TO INTERFERE WHAT A HELL THAT WOULD BE FOR GOD'S PRESENCE IN THE VERY BEING AND NOTHING ELSE IS BLISS
NO SAID MISTER REDMAIN SHE MUST STAY WHERE SHE IS I FANCY SOMETHING HAPPENED LAST NIGHT WHICH SHE HAS GOT TO TELL US ABOUT AH WHAT WAS THAT ASKED MISTER BRETT FACING ROUND ON HER
PULLING THE BELL HARD THAT DONE HE BEGAN TO EXAMINE THE RING INTENTLY AS MARY HAD BEEN DOING AND DID NOT SPEAK A WORD MEWKS CAME SHOW MISS MARSTON OUT SAID HIS MASTER AND TELL MY COACHMAN TO BRING THE HANSOM ROUND DIRECTLY
SHE WAS SO REJOICED TO KNOW THAT HE MUST BE SOMEWHERE NEAR THAT FOR VERY DELIGHT OF UNSECURED SAFETY SHE HELD HER PEACE AND HAD ALMOST STOPPED BUT SHE RAN ON AGAIN
HE BROUGHT A CHAIR AND MAKING HER SIT DOWN BEGAN TO BLOW THE COVERED FIRE ON THE HEARTH WHERE HE HAD NOT LONG BEFORE BOILED HIS KETTLE FOR HIS TEA THEN CLOSING THE DOOR HE LIGHTED A CANDLE
IN THE EARS OF ONE WHO DID NOT LOOK SO FAR AHEAD AS MARY SHE TRAINED TO REGARD ALL THINGS IN THEIR TRUE IMPORT WAS REJOICED TO FIND HIM LOATHING HIS FORMER SELF AND BEYOND THE PRESENT SUFFERING
FOR ME TO PART WITH MY MAID YOU UNDERTOOK TO PERFORM HER DUTIES I DID NOT ENGAGE YOU AS A SICK NURSE FOR OTHER PEOPLE NO MA'AM REPLIED MARY BUT THIS IS AN EXTREME CASE
FOR SHE MUST WRITE TO MISTER TURNBULL FOR MONEY AND THAT SHE DISLIKED BUT BY THE VERY NEXT POST SHE RECEIVED INCLOSED IN A BUSINESS MEMORANDUM IN GEORGE'S WRITING THE CHECK FOR FIFTY POUNDS SHE HAD REQUESTED
WITH MISERY OVER THE DEATH OF HIS CHILD AND THE CONDUCT WHICH HAD DISGRACED HIM IN HIS OWN EYES AND RUINED HIS WIFE'S HAPPINESS COMBINED TO RETARD HIS RECOVERY WHILE HE WAS YET DELIRIOUS
MARY BEGAN HER STORY WITH THE INCIDENT OF HER HAVING BEEN PURSUED BY SOME ONE AND RESCUED BY THE BLACKSMITH WHOM SHE TOLD HER LISTENERS SHE HAD KNOWN IN LONDON THEN SHE NARRATED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED THE NIGHT BEFORE FROM FIRST TO LAST
AND THAT HE HAD PLENTY OF TIME BOTH FOR HIS VIOLIN AND HIS BOOKS WHEN THEY CAME TO THE SUBURBS SHE SENT HIM HOME AND WENT STRAIGHT TO MISTER BRETT WITH MISTER REDMAIN'S MESSAGE HE UNDERTOOK TO BE AT DURNMELLING AT THE TIME APPOINTED
IF I HAD BUT KNOWN HOW MUCH YOU WERE WORTH AND HOW LITTLE I WAS WORTH MYSELF OH ME OH ME HE BURST INTO AN INCONTROLLABLE WAIL THAT TORTURED LETTY WITH ITS LIKENESS TO THE CRYING OF HER BABY
HAS ANYTHING HAPPENED TO TOM SHE BROKE INTO A LOW CHILDISH WAIL AND FOR A TIME THAT WAS ALL MARY HEARD PRESENTLY HOWEVER SHE BECAME AWARE OF A FEEBLE MOANING IN THE ADJOINING CHAMBER
MOVING IT ABOUT A LITTLE AND CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF THE LIGHT AND WHILE HER GAZE WAS ON THE RING MISTER REDMAIN'S GAZE WAS ON HER WATCHING HER WITH EQUAL ATTENTION AT LAST WITH A SIGH AS IF SHE WAKED FROM A REVERIE SHE LAID THE RING ON THE TABLE
WHEN HE TURNED THE COUNT WAS GONE AS HE HAD EXPECTED AND SEPIA STOOD WITH EYES FULL OF ANGER AND FEAR HER FACE WAS SET AND COLORLESS AND STRANGE TO LOOK UPON VERY ODD AIN'T IT
A WORLD WHICH HIS WORLD WORSHIPED WAITING HE MIGHT MISS HER EVEN TO DEATH HER ABSENCE MIGHT FOR HIM DARKEN THE UNIVERSE AS IF THE SUN HAD WITHDRAWN HIS BRIGHTNESS
IT WAS BURNING HE OPENED HIS EYES BUT SHE SAW THEIR SENSE WAS GONE SHE WENT BACK TO LETTY AND SITTING DOWN BESIDE HER PUT HER ARM ABOUT HER AND SAID WHY DIDN'T YOU SEND FOR ME LETTY
THE ANALYSIS OF SUCH A NATURE AS HERS WITH HER STORY TO SET IT FORTH WOULD REQUIRE A BOOK TO ITSELF AND I MUST HAPPILY CONTENT MYSELF WITH BUT A FACT HERE AND THERE IN HER HISTORY IN ONE OF HER RAMBLES ON HIS GROUND
AND IN THE SHOP WAS DELIGHTFUL IF SHE EVER HAD ANOTHER OFFER OF MARRIAGE THE FACT REMAINED UNKNOWN SHE LIVED TO BE A SWEET GRACIOUS LITTLE OLD LADY AND OFTEN FORGOT THAT SHE WAS A WIDOW BUT NEVER THAT SHE WAS A WIFE
THE BABY'S ALL RIGHT MARY SAYS AND SOME DAY SHE SAYS HE WILL RUN INTO YOUR ARMS AND KNOW YOU FOR HIS FATHER
IN THE MEAN TIME THE OLD LADY KEPT HER LYNX EYE UPON THE YOUNG PEOPLE BUT GODFREY HAVING CAUGHT A CERTAIN EXPRESSION IN THE SAID EYE CAME TO THE RESOLUTION THAT THENCEFORTH THEIR SCHOOLROOM SHOULD BE THE COMMON SITTING ROOM
SMALL IDEA HAD MISSUS TURNBULL OF THE DIVERSION WHICH ON SUCH OCCASIONS SHE AFFORDED THE CUSTOMERS PRESENT ONE DAY A SHORT TIME BEFORE HER MARRIAGE DELAYED BY THE ILLNESS OF MISTER REDMAIN MISS MORTIMER HAPPENED TO BE IN THE SHOP
WAS SOON DRIVING WHAT HE CALLED A ROARING TRADE HE BOUGHT AND SOLD A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN MARY BUT SHE HAD BUSINESS SUFFICIENT TO EMPLOY HER DAYS AND LEAVE HER NIGHTS FREE AND BRING HER AND LETTY ENOUGH TO LIVE ON AS COMFORTABLY AS THEY DESIRED
HE HAD BEFORE DISCOVERED THAT ABOUT THE TIME WHEN THE RING DISAPPEARED THE COUNT HAD HAD LOSSES AND WAS SUPPOSED UNABLE TO MEET THEM BUT HAD SUDDENLY SHOWED HIMSELF AGAIN FLUSH OF MONEY AND FROM THAT TIME HAD HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY RUN OF LUCK
ONE DAY THEREFORE AS SHE HERSELF SAT KNITTING ONE SOCK FOR GODFREY AND LETTY DARNING ANOTHER SHE OPENED THE MATTER I AM GETTING OLD LETTY SHE SAID AND YOU CAN'T BE HERE ALWAYS
AND ALL SORTS OF ODD JOBS TO BE DONE HE SOON FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT WITH A CARPENTER AND WHEELWRIGHT TO WORK ON HIS PREMISES BEFORE TWO YEARS WERE OVER HE WAS WHAT PEOPLE CALL A FLOURISHING MAN AND LAYING BY A LITTLE MONEY
SHE WISHED HIM A GOOD MORNING BUT SHE WAS NOT TOO MUCH CONFUSED TO THANK HIM AGAIN FOR THE PERMISSION HE HAD GIVEN HER TO WALK ON HIS GROUND IT WAS NOT BY ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF GODFREY THAT THEY MET SEVERAL TIMES AFTER THIS
AND SOMETIMES FOR DAYS MARY WOULD NOT HAVE AN IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON IN HIM WHEN SUFFERING HE WOULD OCCASIONALLY BREAK INTO FIERCE AND EVIL LANGUAGE THEN BE SUDDENLY SILENT GOD AND SATAN WERE STRIVING FOR THE MAN
BUT IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE THIS ANSWER WOULD HAVE ALMOST DRIVEN THE WOMAN OUT OF HER REASON ALREADY BETWEEN ANNOYANCE WITH HERSELF AND ANGER WITH MARY HER HUE WAS PURPLE SOMETHING SHE CALLED HER CONSTITUTION
ALMOST EVERY EVENING UNTIL HE LEFT DURNMELLING MARY WENT TO SEE MISTER REDMAIN SHE READ TO HIM AND TRIED TO TEACH HIM
CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN LYDGATE STEET LETTY'S WHOLE LIFE WAS NOW GATHERED ABOUT HER BOY AND SHE THOUGHT LITTLE COMPARATIVELY ABOUT TOM AND TOM THOUGHT SO LITTLE ABOUT HER THAT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE
ON WHICH STOOD A SINGLE CANDLE THERE WAS BUT A SPARK OF FIRE IN THE DREARY GRATE AND LETTY WAS COLDER THAN ANY ONE COULD KNOW FOR SHE WAS AT THE MOMENT MAKING DOWN THE LAST WOOLLY GARMENT SHE HAD IN THE VAIN HOPE OF WARMING HER BABY
WHO HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW HOW THINGS GO WITH YOU IF I HAVE NOT COME YOU MUST TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT I HAVE NOTHING TO TELL COUSIN GODFREY SHE REPLIED WITH SOME CALMNESS FOR GODFREY'S DECISION HAD ENABLED HER TO CONQUER HERSELF
SAYING IN ALL HONESTY HE WOULD RATHER DIE THAN FALL FOR ONE SOLITARY WEEK INTO THE OLD WAYS NOT THAT HE WISHED TO DIE FOR WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH HE DID NOT BELIEVE HE COULD FALL INTO THE OLD WAYS AGAIN
SHE RAN TO HIM AND THE SAME MOMENT WAS IN HIS ARMS WITH HER HEAD ON HIS SHOULDER WEEPING TEARS OF SUCH GLADNESS AS SHE HAD NOT KNOWN SINCE THE FIRST WEEK OF HER MARRIAGE NEITHER SPOKE FOR SOME TIME LETTY COULD NOT BECAUSE SHE WAS CRYING
AND AS NOTHING CAN RECALL IT OR MAKE IT NOT BE WHERE CAN BE THE GOOD IN THINKING ABOUT IT A REASONING WORSE THAN DANGEROUS BEFORE ONE HAS LEFT OFF BEING CAPABLE OF THE SAME THING OVER AGAIN STILL
THE DAUGHTER NEVER RESPONDED SHE HAD NO THOUGHT OF PLANS IN COMMON WITH HER STRANGE RUMORS CAME ABROAD GODFREY WARDOUR HEARD SOMETHING OF THEM AND LAUGHED THEM TO SCORN
SHE LOOKED UP SHE HAD THOUGHT IT WAS THE LANDLADY
TO GODFREY BECAUSE FOR THE MOMENT HE HAD FORGOTTEN HIMSELF AND HAD NEITHER THOUGHT OF INJURY NOR HOPE OF LOVE REMEMBERING ONLY THE OLD DAYS AND THE LETTY THAT USED TO BE IT MAY SEEM STRANGE THAT
SAID CONFIDENTIALLY WHAT MADE MY MOTHER SPEAK TO YOU LIKE THAT MARY YOU MUST ASK HERSELF SHE ANSWERED THERE YOU ARE AS USUAL MARY HE PROTESTED YOU WILL NEVER LET A FELLOW TAKE YOUR PART
BUT SUCH WOMEN GO IN FOR BEING SAINTS AND THAT IS NOT MY LINE I WAS NOT MADE FOR THAT YOU WERE MADE FOR THAT AND FAR MORE SAID MARY THERE ARE SUCH WOMEN I KNOW PERSISTED HESPER
VERY ODD TRICKS ARE PLAYED WITH GEMS SUCH GEMS THAT IS AS ARE OF VALUE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH A ROGUE'S WHILE SO SAYING HE TOOK THE RING FROM ONE DRAWER AND FROM ANOTHER A BOTTLE FROM WHICH HE POURED SOMETHING INTO A CRYSTAL CUP THEN HE TOOK A FILE
THE ASSURANCE OF DEATH AT THE DOOR AND A WHOLESOME SHAME OF THINGS THAT ARE PAST MAY I THINK LEAD UP TO SUCH A SWIFT CHANGE EVEN IN A MUCH WORSE MAN THAN TOM
AND DURING THE TEN DAYS THAT SEPIA WAS ALONE CAME TO SEE HER SEVERAL TIMES CALLED EARLY IN THE FORENOON FIRST THE NEXT DAY IN THE EVENING WHEN THEY WENT TOGETHER TO THE OPERA AND ONCE CAME AND STAID LATE
HE GREW HUMAN TOWARD HIM AND SAW IN HIM LETTY AND NOT TOM GOOD GOD THE CHILD IS STARVING TOO HE EXCLAIMED OH NO COUSIN GODFREY CRIED LETTY
BUT MISTER REDMAIN STILL STARED IN HER FACE NOW WHAT IS IT YOU'VE GOT IN YOUR HEAD HE SAID AT LAST
WITH A RAPIDITY THAT WOULD HAVE ASTONISHED HIM SHE WOULD THEREBY HAVE COME INTO HER SPIRITUAL PROPERTY AT ONCE AND HEAVEN WOULD HAVE OPENED TO HER A LITTLE WAY AT LEAST PROBABLY TO CLOSE AGAIN FOR A TIME
OLD MISTER DUPPA DIED AND A YOUNG MAN CAME TO MINISTER TO HIS CONGREGATION WHO THOUGHT THE BAPTISM OF THE SPIRIT OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN THE MOST CORRECT OF OPINIONS CONCERNING EVEN THE BAPTIZING SPIRIT
A FINE THING IF YOUR PRETENDED SQUEAMISHNESS RUIN MY PLOT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF YOURSELF HEY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT HE LOOKED AT HER KEENLY EXPECTING A RESPONSE BUT MARY MADE HIM NONE FOR SOME MOMENTS HE REGARDED HER CURIOUSLY THEN TURNED AWAY INTO THE STUDY SAYING
NOT WITTINGLY WOULD SHE ALLOW THE FINEST EDGE EVEN OF ANCIENT KINDNESS TO COME BETWEEN HER TOM AND HERSELF TO ACCEPT FROM HER COUSIN GODFREY THE HELP HER HUSBAND OUGHT TO PROVIDE HER WOULD BE TO LET HIM HOWEVER INNOCENTLY STEP INTO HIS PLACE
THEY WOULD FOR INSTANCE KEEP WATCH ON HER SERVING AND AS SOON AS THE CUSTOMER WAS GONE WOULD FIND OPEN FAULT WITH THIS OR THAT SHE HAD SAID OR DONE BUT EVEN THIS WAS COMPARATIVELY ENDURABLE
HAPPILY THE CHARACTER OF MISTER BRETT WAS WELL KNOWN IN TESTBRIDGE AND ALL THE COUNTRY ROUND AND FROM HIM GODFREY WARDOUR LEARNED WHAT SENT HIM TRAVELING ON THE CONTINENT AGAIN NOT IN THE HOPE OF FINDING SEPIA
SHE KNEW WHAT SHE HAD GAINED IN TOM HELMER HE PASSED A TROUBLED NIGHT DREAMED PAINFULLY AND STARTED AWAKE TO RENEWED PAIN
NOW SHE FELT CRUSHED THE IDEA OF UNDERTAKING THAT FOR WHICH SHE KNEW HERSELF SO ILL FITTED WAS NOT MERELY ODIOUS BUT FRIGHTFUL TO HER SHE WAS READY ENOUGH TO WORK BUT IT MUST BE REAL NOT SHAM WORK
BADLY AS HE HAD HIMSELF BEHAVED TO MARY HE WAS NOW FURIOUS WITH HIS WIFE FOR HAVING TREATED HER SO HEARTLESSLY THAT SHE COULD NOT RETURN TO HER SERVICE
AND THE GREATER WERE HIS REGRETS THAT HE HAD NOT SECURED THE MISCREANT ANYHOW MISS HE SAID YOU'LL NEVER COME FROM THERE ALONE IN THE DARK AGAIN I UNDERSTAND YOU JOSEPH ANSWERED MARY
COME OUT WITH IT HARDLY THINK SIR ANSWERED MARY I WAS ONLY PLAGUING MYSELF BETWEEN MY RECOLLECTION OF THE STONE AND THE ACTUAL LOOK OF IT IT IS SO ANNOYING TO FIND WHAT SEEMED A CLEAR RECOLLECTION PROVE A DECEITFUL ONE
THERE SOON CAME A CHANGE HOWEVER AND THE LESSONS CEASED ALTOGETHER TOM HAD COME DOWN TO HIS OLD QUARTERS AND IN THE ARROGANCE OF CONVALESCENCE HAD PRESUMED ON HIS IMAGINED STRENGTH AND SO CAUGHT COLD
THAN SHE WROTE TO MARY INVITING HER TO GO AND VISIT HER BUT MARY ANSWERED SHE COULD NO MORE LEAVE HOME AND MUST CONTENT HERSELF WITH THE HOPE OF SEEING MISSUS REDMAIN WHEN SHE CAME TO DURNMELLING
NOR DID THE FIREFLY SPARE ITS DOLE OF HOMAGE TO THE MEMORY OF ONE OF ITS GAYEST WRITERS INDEED ALL ABOUT ITS OFFICE HAD LOVED HIM EACH AFTER HIS FACULTY EVEN THE BOY CRIED WHEN HE HEARD HE WAS GONE FOR TO HIM TOO HE HAD ALWAYS GIVEN A KIND WORD COMING AND GOING
AND THE REST IN THE SHOP BEING MOSTLY CREATURES OF HIS OWN CHOICE BY A SORT OF IMPLICIT UNDERSTANDING THEY PROCEEDED TO MAKE HER UNCOMFORTABLE SO LONG AS THEY CONFINED THEMSELVES TO SILENCE NEGLECT AND GENERAL EXCLUSION
AND GRIEF AND SHAME AND CONSTERNATION OPERATED AT WILL ON HIS POETIC NATURE THE THINGS HE KEPT SAYING OVER AND OVER WERE VERY PITIFUL BUT THEY WOULD HAVE SOUNDED MORE MISERABLE BY MUCH
HE LAID THE POCKET BOOK ON THE TABLE THERE WAS TEN TIMES AS MUCH IN IT AS EVER LETTY HAD HAD AT ONCE BUT SHE NEVER KNEW WHAT WAS IN IT SHE ROSE WITH INSTANT RESOLVE ALL THE WOMAN IN HER WAKED AT ONCE
ALTHOUGH HE HAD NEVER GIVEN HER GROUND FOR BELIEVING AND SHE HAD NEVER HAD CONCEIT ENOUGH TO IMAGINE THAT HE CARED THE LEAST FOR HER PERSON
AND MARY LOOKING ABOUT HER COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THE CHANGE THAT HAD COME UPON THE MISERABLE VACUITY JOSEPH SAT DOWN UPON HIS ANVIL AND BEGGED TO KNOW WHERE SHE HAD JUST BEEN AND HOW FAR SHE HAD RUN FROM THE RASCAL
SHE SAID THEN PLEASE MA'AM REPLIED MARY WOULD YOU MIND LETTING JEMIMA DRESS YOU I WANT TO GO OUT AGAIN AND SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU COULD DO WITHOUT ME FOR SOME DAYS MY FRIEND'S BABY IS DEAD
MISTER REDMAIN FILED AWAY HEEDLESS THEN WITH THE HELP OF A PAIR OF PINCERS FREED THE STONE AND HELD IT UP IN HIS HAND YOU SEE THIS HE SAID A SPLENDID SAPPHIRE ANSWERED COUNT GALOFTA TAKING IT IN HIS FINGERS
MARY'S DELIGHT WAS GREAT WHEN FIRST HE BROUGHT HER ONE OF HIS COMPOSITIONS VERY FAIRLY WRITTEN OUT AFTER WHICH OTHERS FOLLOWED WITH A RAPIDITY THAT ASTONISHED HER THEY ENABLED HER ALSO TO UNDERSTAND THE MAN BETTER AND BETTER
WHEN HE HAD DONE WITH JOSEPH OR WHEN HE DID NOT WANT HIM MARY WAS ALWAYS READY TO GIVE THE LATTER A LESSON AND HAD HE BEEN A LESS GIFTED MAN THAN HE WAS HE COULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO MAKE PROGRESS WITH SUCH A TEACHER
WHEN SHE HEARD OF HIS DEATH SHE HOWLED AND CURSED HER FATE AND THE WOMAN MEANING POOR LETTY
AND SOMETHING DID SEEM TO BE GETTING INTO OR WAKING UP IN HIM THE MAN HAD NEVER BEFORE IN THE LEAST SUBMITTED BUT NOW IT LOOKED AS IF THE WATCHING SPIRIT OF LIFE WERE FEELING THROUGH THE DUST HEAP OF HIS EVIL JUDGMENTS
AND HAD BEGUN TO LOOK DEAD AND AS IF IT WANTED ONLY TO BE BURIED OUT OF HER SIGHT FOR WHAT IS DONE IS DONE
SHE HAD TO PRAY MUCH TOO OFTEN TO KNEEL ALWAYS AND GOD WAS TOO NEAR HER WHEREVER SHE HAPPENED TO BE FOR THE FANCY THAT SHE MUST SEEK HIM IN ANY PARTICULAR PLACE BUT SO IT HAPPENED NOW SHE ROSE A LITTLE STARTLED RATHER THAN TROUBLED
LOOKING OUT FOR HER AS HE HAD SAID HE WOULD HER MOTHER IN LAW COULD NOT HELP DYING BUT SHE NEVER FORGAVE HER FOR WHAT NOBODY KNEW AFTER A YEAR OR SO MISSUS WARDOUR BEGAN TO TAKE A LITTLE NOTICE OF HER AGAIN
I WILL GO AWAY IF YOU SPEAK A WORD AGAINST HIM I WILL I WILL I MUST YOU KNOW GODFREY MADE NO REPLY NEITHER APOLOGIZED NOR SOUGHT TO COVER WHY CHILD HE SAID AT LAST
I MEAN HE MADE FAR GREATER DEMAND FOR JUSTICE UPON OTHER PEOPLE THAN UPON HIMSELF AND WAS MUCH MORE INDIGNANT AT ANY SHORTCOMING OF THEIRS WHICH CROSSED ANY DESIRE OR PURPOSE OF HIS THAN HE WAS ANXIOUS IN HIS OWN PERSON TO FULFILL JUSTICE WHEN THAT FULFILLMENT IN ITS TURN WOULD CROSS ANY WISH HE CHERISHED
HESPER LAUGHED I AM PRETTY COMFORTABLE WHERE I AM SHE SAID HUSBAND AND ALL
WHETHER IT MIGHT NOT NOW BE TIME TO LET BYGONES BE BYGONES AND MAKE SOME INQUIRY CONCERNING HER TO THIS LETTER GODFREY RETURNED NO ANSWER
JOSEPH WHOSE VIOLIN WAS USELESS NOW WAS NOT THE LESS IN ATTENDANCE EVERY EVENING WHEN HIS WORK WAS OVER HE CAME KNOCKING GENTLY AT THE DOOR OF THE PARLOR AND NEVER LEFT UNTIL TOM WAS SETTLED FOR THE NIGHT
WITH A PATHOS HER AUNT QUITE MISUNDERSTOOD AS SOON AS I HAVE SECURED FOR YOU A DESIRABLE SITUATION NOT BEFORE ANSWERED MISSUS WARDOUR IN A TONE GENEROUSLY PROTECTIVE
THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO ATTEND TO THOSE THINGS I DON'T SEE THAT I'M AT ALL WORSE THAN OTHER PEOPLE PERSISTED HESPER I CAN'T GO AND PRETEND TO BE SORRY FOR SINS I SHOULD COMMIT AGAIN THE NEXT TIME THERE WAS A NECESSITY
THEY KNOW BETTER WHICH SIDE THEIR BREAD IS BUTTERED HESPER STARTED UP IN A RAGE
NOT WHERE THERE IS NO HEART IN THE READER HESPER'S FACE FLUSHED BUT SHE DID HER BEST NOT TO LOSE HER TEMPER NOT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANY GREAT LOSS IF SHE HAD FOR THERE IS AS MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE VALUES OF TEMPERS AS IN THOSE WHO LOSE THEM
OF A LOVING WIFE TO A MAN LIKE MISTER REDMAIN THERE IS NO USE MINCING MATTERS WITH YOU MARY BUT YOU PROMISED PERSISTED MARY IT BELONGS BESIDES TO THE VERY IDEA OF MARRIAGE
BUT WAS SHE BOUND TO HARBOR IT AFTER IT HAD BEGUN TO BITE THERE ARE WHO NEVER LEARN TO SEE ANYTHING EXCEPT IN ITS RELATION TO THEMSELVES NOR THAT RELATION EXCEPT AS FANCIED BY THEMSELVES AND THIS BEING A WITHERING HABIT OF MIND
FOR THERE IS THE LIFE ITSELF ALL SURROUNDING AND EVER PRESSING IN UPON THE HUMAN SOUL WHEREVER THAT SOUL WILL AFFORD A CHINK OF ENTRANCE AND TOM HAD NOT YET SEALED UP ALL HIS DOORS WHEN HE LAY THERE DEAD
THE SOFT SWIFT STEPS CAME NEARER AND NEARER WAS THAT MUSIC SHE HEARD SHE DARED NOT STOP TO LISTEN BUT IMMEDIATELY THEREUPON WAS POURED FORTH ON THE DIM AIR SUCH A STREAM OF PEARLY SOUNDS
THE MOST SILENTLY HELPFUL UNDEMONSTRATIVE BEING HE WAS THAT DOCTOR COULD DESIRE TO WAIT UPON PATIENT WHEN IT WAS HIS TURN TO WATCH HE NEVER CLOSED AN EYE BUT AT DAYBREAK FOR IT WAS NOW SPRING
AND HATES HER THRALLDOM HAPPILY TOM HAD NOT REACHED THIS DEPTH OF PERDITION SEPIA WAS PRUDENT FOR HERSELF AND KNEW NONE BETTER WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT SO FAR AS THE NEAR FUTURE WAS CONCERNED THEREFORE HELD HIM AT ARM'S LENGTH
AT LAST MISTER REDMAIN TOLD HOW HE HAD ONCE GOT MONEY OUT OF A LADY I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS A WORD OF TRUTH IN IT BUT IT WAS CAPPED BY THE OTHER WITH A NARRATIVE THAT SEEMED SPECIALLY PLEASING TO THE LISTENER IN THE MIDST OF A BURST OF LAUGHTER HE ROSE AND RANG THE BELL
ALL THE DAYS OF HER APPOINTED TIME SHE WAITED TILL HER CHANGE SHOULD COME
NOT TO SAY NO WOMAN COULD HAVE FAILED TO BE PLEASED AT THE THOROUGH PAINSTAKING WITH WHICH HE FOLLOWED THE SLIGHTEST OF HER HINTS AND THE DELIGHT HIS FLUSHED FACE WOULD REVEAL WHEN SHE PRAISED THE SUCCESS HE HAD ACHIEVED
SKILLFUL NOT FROM EXPERIENCE BUT SIMPLY FROM HER FAITH WHENCE CAME BOTH CONSCIENCE OF AND CAPACITY FOR DOING WHAT THE DOCTOR TOLD HER THINGS WENT WELL IT IS FROM THEIR WANT OF THIS FAITH
IF YOU WANTED TO TAKE MY PART YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE SO WHEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME GOOD IN IT HOW COULD I BEFORE MISS MORTIMER YOU KNOW THEN WHY DO IT NOW
NO ON PRINCIPLE AND FOR THE SAKE OF EXAMPLE I WILL NOT LET YOU GO I THOUGHT SAID MARY NOT A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN HESPER
EXCEPT THAT BABY IS ILL AND LOOKS AS IF HE WOULD NEVER GET BETTER AND IT IS LIKE TO BREAK MY HEART OH HE IS SUCH A DARLING COUSIN GODFREY LET ME SEE HIM SAID GODFREY IN HIS HEART DETESTING THE CHILD
AS HE SPOKE SHE ROSE TO HER FEET HER COUNTENANCE ILLUMINED BOTH WITH RIGHTEOUS ANGER AND THE TENDER SHINE OF PRAYER HER LOOK WENT TO WHAT HE HAD OF A HEART AND THE SLIGHTEST POSSIBLE COLOR ROSE TO HIS FACE GONE A STEP TOO FAR DAMN IT HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF
USING CABS THEN YOU HAD BETTER GET INTO THE HABIT FOR I SWEAR TO YOU MADAM IF YOU DON'T FETCH THAT GIRL HOME WITHIN THE WEEK I WILL NEXT MONDAY DISCHARGE YOUR COACHMAN AND SEND EVERY HORSE IN THE STABLE TO TATTERSALL'S GOOD MORNING
THE MORE THEY RESENT THE RUDENESS WHICH SPRINGS FROM AN OPPOSITE NATURE ABSOLUTELY COURTEOUS THEY FLAME AT DISCOURTESY AND THUS LACK OF THE PERFECTION TO WHICH PATIENCE WOULD AND MUST RAISE THEM
THEN WE DREAD THE DISAPPROVAL OF THE LOWLIEST AND GODFREY WAS THE ONLY ONE BEFORE WHOM HIS MOTHER FELT ANY KIND OF AWE TOWARD HIM THEREFORE SHE KEPT SILENCE FOR THE PRESENT IF SHE HAD SPOKEN THEN THINGS MIGHT HAVE GONE VERY DIFFERENTLY
NOW KEEN AND STINGING THE AGONY OF HER DESERTION HE SAID WOULD NEVER CEASE GNAWING AT HIS HEART UNTIL IT WAS LAID IN THE GRAVE
SHE MADE CONSEQUENTLY WHAT PREPARATION SHE COULD AGAINST SURPRISE THOROUGHLY CAPABLE OF MANAGING HER FEATURES HER ANXIETY WAS SUFFICIENT NEVERTHELESS TO DEPRIVE HER OF POWER OVER HER COMPLEXION AND SHE ENTERED THE ROOM WITH THE PALLOR PECULIAR TO THE DARK SKINNED
SHE GAZED FOR A MOMENT IN BEWILDERMENT SAW WHO IT WAS AND JUMPED UP HALF FRIGHTENED HALF READY TO GO WILD WITH JOY ALL THE MEMORIES OF GODFREY RUSHED IN A CONFUSED HEAP UPON HER AND OVERWHELMED HER
FOR HIS MOTHER HER MEMORY WAS MOSTLY IN HER TEMPER SHE HAD NEVER UNDERSTOOD HER WAYWARD CHILD JUST BECAUSE SHE HAD GIVEN HIM HER WAYWARDNESS
BUT THE SHADOW OF HER FATHER'S ABSENCE SWALLOWED ALL THE OTHER SHADOWS THE AIR OF WARMTH AND PEACE AND CONSCIOUS SAFETY WHICH HAD HITHERTO SURROUNDED HER WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE COLD EXPOSURE AND ANNOYANCE
AND SPED ON AGAIN SHE WOULD HAVE RUN BUT THERE WAS NO PLACE OF REFUGE NOW NEARER THAN THE CORNER OF THE TURNPIKE ROAD AND SHE KNEW HER BREATH WOULD FAIL HER LONG BEFORE THAT HOW LONELY AND SHELTERLESS THE COMMON LOOKED
AND WHEN MISSUS TURNBULL CAME IN WHICH HAPPILY WAS BUT SELDOM SHE FELT AS IF FROM SOME SEPULCHRE IN HER MIND A VERY DEMON SPRANG TO MEET HER FOR SHE BEHAVED TO HER WORST OF ALL
SHE WOULD HEAVE HERSELF IN WITH THE AIR AND LOOK OF A VULGAR DUCHESS FOR FROM THE HEIGHT OF HER SMALL CONSCIOUSNESS SHE LOOKED DOWN UPON THE SHOP AND NEVER ENTERED IT SAVE AS A CUSTOMER THE DAUGHTER OF A SMALL COUNTRY ATTORNEY
YET IS THERE TESTIMONY ONLY TOO STRONG AND TERRIBLE TO THE DEMONIACAL POWER ENSLAVING AND ABSORBING AS THE ARMS OF THE KRAKEN OF AN EVIL WOMAN OVER AN IMAGINATIVE YOUTH POSSIBLY DID HE KNOW BEFOREHAND HER NATURE HE WOULD NOT LOVE HER
AND GODFREY WOULD NOT BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO CRY THOSE FEW MOMENTS WERE PURE SIMPLE HAPPINESS TO BOTH OF THEM TO LETTY BECAUSE SHE HAD LOVED HIM FROM CHILDHOOD AND HOPED THAT ALL WAS TO BE AS OF OLD BETWEEN THEM
GIVING RISE TO MANY QUESTIONS AND A LONG CONVERSATION ENSUED SUDDENLY SHE WOKE OR SEEMED TO WAKE TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HERSELF AND THE PROPRIETIES TOGETHER HASTILY AND TO ALL APPEARANCE WITH SOME CONFUSION
THAT THE PAYMENT OF VARIOUS THINGS HE HAD TOLD HER TO ORDER AND HE WOULD SEE TO HAD BEEN NEGLECTED AND THAT THE TRADESPEOPLE WERE GETTING PERSISTENT IN THEIR APPLICATIONS THAT WHEN SHE TOLD HIM ANYTHING OF THE SORT HE TREATED IT AT ONE TIME AS A MATTER OF NO CONSEQUENCE
WHEN TURNBULL IN THE NARROW SPACE BEHIND THE COUNTER WOULD PUSH HIS WAY PAST HER WITHOUT OTHER PRETENSE OF APOLOGY THAN SOMETHING LIKE A SNEER SHE DID FEEL FOR A MOMENT AS IF EVIL WERE ABOUT TO HAVE THE VICTORY OVER HER
BUT THE PERFECTED RESULT OF THE LAWS THAT AVENGE LAW BREACH IT IS IN AND THROUGH SUCH THAT WE GET GLIMPSES DOWN THE GULF OF A MORAL VOLCANO TO THE INFERNAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE HUMAN THE LAWLESS ROT OF THAT WHICH
THERE IS ONE SHOW OF BREEDING VULGARITY SELDOM ASSUMES SIMPLICITY NO SIGN OF RECOGNITION WOULD PASS BETWEEN HER HUSBAND AND HERSELF BY ONE STERN REFUSAL TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS ADVANCES
SHE HAD NOT BEEN AT ALL PITYING HERSELF BUT SUCH AN UTTERANCE FROM THE MAN SHE LOVED LIKE AN ELDER BROTHER SO WROUGHT UPON HER ENFEEBLED CONDITION THAT SHE BROKE INTO A CRY SHE STROVE TO SUPPRESS HER EMOTION
SAID HESPER YOU CAN NOT LEAVE WITHOUT GIVING ME A MONTH'S NOTICE THE UNDERSTANDING ON WHICH I CAME TO YOU WAS VERY DIFFERENT SAID MARY SADLY IT WAS BUT SINCE THEN
AND THEN HASTILY DEPART AS BEFORE TOWARD THE MOUNTAIN WHAT COMES NEXT MUTTERED WHITEBIRD TO HIMSELF I AM DYING TO PEEP INTO THAT HOLE I CANNOT WAIT MUCH LONGER THEN AFTER A WHILE
IT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT EVENT IN A BOY'S LIFE LIKE GRADUATION FROM SCHOOL OR COLLEGE NOWADAYS FOR THIS MEANT THE GRADUATION FROM BOYHOOD INTO MANHOOD THE WINNING OF A WARRIOR'S DIPLOMA
SOAR ALOFT COMMANDED SOLOMON STERNLY AND FIND THE HOOPOE THAT I MAY PUNISH HIM I WILL PLUCK OFF HIS FEATHERS THAT HE MAY FEEL THE SCORCHING HEAT OF THE SUN AS HIS CARELESSNESS HAS CAUSED ME TO DO THE EAGLE SOARED HEAVENWARD
REMEMBER KING THAT ONE DAY YOU ALSO MUST GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF YOUR SINS LET ME NOT THEREFORE BE CONDEMNED UNHEARD AND IF I HEAR YOU WHAT EXCUSE CAN YOU HAVE TO OFFER ANSWERED SOLOMON FROWNING
A PRETTY LONG LEGGED SLENDER LADY HERON WHO LIVED IN THE MUSHY SQUSHY WADY SHADY SWAMP THE LADY HERON LIVED IN HER SWAMP ALL ALONE EARNING HER LIVING BY CATCHING LITTLE FISH
THINKING THUS MOURNFULLY THE PHOENIX SAT UPON THE TOP OF THE TALLEST PALM HIS PLUMAGE OF CRIMSON AND GOLD GLOWED IN THE LAST RAYS OF THE SETTING SUN
AND TRY AGAIN IN ANOTHER YEAR BUT THE FATHER STERNLY REFUSED FOR HE WAS AMBITIOUS NAY LAD HE CRIED FROWNINGLY WOULD YOU FAIL ME NOW THINK OF THE GLORY
AS HER WINGS TOUCHED THE WET SHOULDERS
UNTIL THE EARTH BENEATH HIM LOOKED LIKE A BOWL TURNED UPSIDE DOWN
WILL YOU LET IN TWO STORM TOSSED TRAVELERS FOR A NIGHT'S LODGING GRUFFLY THE SELFISH OLD OWL BADE THEM ENTER AND GRUDGINGLY INVITED THEM TO SHARE HIS SUPPER
NOW LISTEN TO ME DON'T YOU KNOW DEAR CROCODILE THAT THE DUCK LIVES ON THE WATER THOUGH SHE IS NEITHER A FISH NOR A REPTILE AND THE DUCK LAYS EGGS
AS FOR YOU DEAR OLD HUNGRY MOUTH
AND HIS EYES FIXED THEMSELVES UPON A TREE CLOSE BY IT WAS A DEAD OLD TREE AND THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE TRUNK HALFWAY UP TO THE LOWEST LIMB A ROUND LITTLE HOLE ABOUT AS BIG AS YOUR TWO FISTS
WITH LUSTY BEAK AND TALON HE TORE THE NEST BODILY FROM THE BRANCHES AND SET OUT UPON HIS PIOUS JOURNEY HE KNEW NOT WHERE HE WENT NOR WHY BUT THE SUN DREW HIM TO THE EAST
SO HE ROSE AND FLYING THROUGH THE STILL NIGHT AIR CAME AGAIN TO THE HERON'S HOME IN THE MARSH COME MY DEAR HE SAID COME HOME TO YOUR DEAR HUSBAND'S HOUSE AND I WILL BE GOOD BUT THE HERON MADE NO ANSWER PRETENDING TO BE ASLEEP
I HOPE I FIND YOU WELL MISS HERON I HAVE BEEN HA HUM CONSIDERING YOUR LAST MOST CONDESCENDING WORDS
HE TOO WAS BECOMING A KINGFISHER HE TOO FELT THE THRILL OF WINGS UPON HIS SHOULDERS WINGS WHICH WERE TO BEAR HIM UP
THE EAGLE LED HIM TO THE KING WHO WITH A WRATHFUL FACE WAS SITTING ON HIS THRONE THE HOOPOE TREMBLED AND DROOPED HIS FEATHERS HUMBLY BUT WHEN SOLOMON WOULD HAVE CRUSHED HIM IN HIS MIGHTY FIST THE BIRD CRIED
THEN YOU WILL BE BLIND WHOLLY BLIND AS I AM NOW AT THESE THREATENING WORDS THE NIGHTINGALE CEASED TO SING
IN A THICK CLOUD OVER THE HEAD OF SOLOMON WHILE HE CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY IN GRATITUDE THE WISE KING OFFERED TO GIVE HIS FEATHERED FRIENDS WHATEVER REWARD THEY MIGHT ASK
FROM THE SUN'S HEAT AS THE HOOPOES HAD FIRST DONE ONE DAY WHILE ON SUCH A JOURNEY
WITH WINGS SPREAD WIDE AND EYES FIXED EAGERLY UPON THE SPOT WHERE THE SUN WAS SURE TO RISE HE WAITED WAITED AT LAST THE GOLDEN EYE APPEARED
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A HEN A COMMON PLUMP CLUCKY MOTHER HEN WHO USED EVERY DAY TO GO DOWN TO THE RIVER AND PICK UP BITS OF FOOD ON THE MOIST BANKS
AND REJOICED IN THE CENTURIES OF SUNSHINE BEFORE HIM DEATH WAS INDEED WORTH DYING TO MAKE THIS LIFE WORTH LIVING SLOWLY THE YOUNG PHOENIX DESCENDED TO THE NEST WHICH HAD BEEN AT ONCE A SEPULCHRE AND A CRADLE
FOR A WHOLE DAY THE HOOPOES TALKED THE MATTER OVER AMONG THEMSELVES THEN THEIR KING CAME TO SOLOMON AND SAID TO HIM WE HAVE CONSIDERED YOUR OFFER O GENEROUS KING
SISTER NIGHTINGALE THEY SAY MAY NOT REST BUT STILL SOUNDS THE NOTES OF HER BEAUTIFUL SONG IN GROVE AND THICKET WHY DOES SHE SING THUS ALL NIGHT LONG AS WELL AS THROUGH THE DAY
THE LORD LOOKED ABOUT HIM AT THE FLOCKS OF NEWLY MADE BIRDS WHO WERE PREENING THEIR WINGS AND WONDERING AT THEIR OWN BRIGHT FEATHERS AND SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL MAKE THESE PRETTY CREATURES USEFUL
BUT HE SAID THAT IT WAS NECESSARY THEN SHE PRAYED THAT IF HE MUST GO HE WOULD TAKE HER WITH HIM FOR SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO REMAIN BEHIND DREADING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
BUT HARDLY HAD SHE BEGUN HER TARDY SUPPER WHEN ONCE MORE MISTER STORK'S SHADOW DARKENED THE MIRROR BEFORE HER AND ONCE MORE SHE HEARD HIS APOLOGETIC CROAK AHEM
EVERY ONE TURNED FOWLER AND BEGAN TO HUNT THE PRECIOUS BIRDS
LET THEM BE OUTCASTS AND NIGHT PROWLERS ENEMIES TO BE ATTACKED AND PUNISHED IF THEY APPEAR AMONG US TO BE AVOIDED BY ALL IN THEIR LONELINESS
ALL NIGHT SHE WAS TOSSED AND BEATEN ABOUT SHELTERLESS IN THE STORM BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN TOO TRUTHFUL TO FLATTER THE VAIN OLD OWL BUT WHEN THE BRIGHT MORNING DAWNED DRAGGLED AND WEARY AS SHE WAS SHE FLEW TO THE COURT OF KING EAGLE
HE LAY MOTIONLESS WITH ONLY A GENTLE HEAVING OF HIS BREAST TO SHOW THAT HE STILL LIVED HIS FATHER LEFT HIM FOR THE LAST TIME AND WENT TO PREPARE THE MORROW'S GOODLY BREAKFAST
THE WISE KING WAS CHATTING PLEASANTLY WITH THE BIRDS WHO LIVED IN HIS WONDERFUL GARDEN AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH HE HEARD THEM SAY THE NIGHTINGALE THE SWEETEST SINGER OF ALL CHANTED
GAPING FOOLISHLY WONDERING WHAT THE HEN COULD MEAN AND HOW HE COULD POSSIBLY BE HER BROTHER AND BY THE TIME HE HAD REMEMBERED HOW HUNGRY HE WAS THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HIM TO EAT
O FOOLISH CREATURES WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED TALKING KING SOLOMON SOFTLY STROKED THE HEAD OF THE PRETTY LITTLE DOVE
AND THIS IS THE STORY OF THE HOOPOE'S CROWN ONE DAY WHEN SOLOMON WAS JOURNEYING ACROSS THE DESERT HE WAS SORELY DISTRESSED BY THE HEAT OF THE SUN UNTIL HE CAME NEAR TO FAINTING JUST THEN HE SPIED A FLOCK OF HIS FRIENDS
GOLD DUST GOLD DUST A TREASURE FOR ME HE SANG HOPPING UP AND DOWN ON ONE LEG I CAN CARRY AWAY A GREAT BEAKFUL OF THE YELLOW SEEDS AND EACH ONE WILL BLOSSOM INTO A GOLDEN FLOWER
FOR HE WAS A BRAVE AND OBEDIENT LAD THE DAYS CREPT BY THE LONG LONG DAYS OF WAITING
WHAT A FOOL I WAS TO BE CAUGHT BY SUCH A WORD
BUT IT WAS A LONG JOURNEY TO HER PALACE AND HE WAS AWKWARD AND SLOW IN TRAVELING UPON LAND BEFORE HE HAD GONE VERY FAR HE WAS TIRED AND OUT OF BREATH AND STOPPED TO REST UNDER A BANANA TREE
AS FOR MEN THEY ALSO HAD ADORED HIM IN TIME PAST AND HAD BUILT TEMPLES IN HIS HONOR
STOOPING TO A LITTLE HOLE IN THE SKIN OF THE TENT HE PEEPED IN TO FIND WHO THE SPEAKER MIGHT BE
PRESENTLY OUT OF THE HOLE POPPED A BLACK HEAD BIGGER THAN WHITEBIRD'S WITH TWO WISE LITTLE TWINKLING EYES OHO SAID WHITEBIRD TO HIMSELF IT IS MOTHER MAGPIE UP TO HER OLD TRICKS HIDING HIDING
SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF OLD A EOLUS KING OF THE WINDS AND LIVED WITH HIM ON HIS HAPPY ISLAND WHERE IT WAS HIS CHIEF BUSINESS
IN HEAVY WAGONS OR CLUMSY BOATS BY DUSTY ROADS OR STORMY WAVES IT WAS IN NO SUCH TROUBLOUS WAYS THAT SOLOMON THE ALL POWERFUL TRAVERSED SPACE AND REACHED THE UTTERMOST CORNERS OF THE EARTH THANKS TO HIS GREAT KNOWLEDGE
AND I FIND THAT I HAVE BEEN HASTY YOU ARE SO GOOD AS TO EXPRESS A BELIEF THAT I SHOULD MAKE A PLEASANT COMPANION SO I SHOULD SO I SHOULD AND AS FOR YOU HE BOWED GALLANTLY
SUCH AS NO OJIBWAY LAD HAD EVER BEFORE KNOWN ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT HE LAY STILL AND SPOKE NEVER A WORD BUT A DREADFUL FEAR WAS IN HIS HEART
HIS EYES BLAZED RED LIKE COALS AND FROM HIS MOUTH CAME SMOKE AND FLAME SO THAT THE GOLD MELTED BEFORE HIS BREATH HE RUSHED STRAIGHT UPON POOR LITTLE WHITEBIRD TO GOBBLE HIM UP AND AS HE CAME HE ROARED THIEF THIEF
INTO THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH AS IF IT WERE MADE OF TRANSPARENT GLASS AND DISCOVER THE PLACES WHERE SPRINGS OF LIVING WATER WERE HIDDEN UNDER THE SOIL IT WAS VERY CONVENIENT FOR SOLOMON WHEN HE WAS TRAVELING TO HAVE SOME ONE WITH HIM
AND THEY DECIDED TO APPEAL ONCE MORE TO KING SOLOMON WHO HAD GRANTED THEIR FOOLISH PRAYER FLYING BY STEALTH THROUGH THE LONELIEST WAYS THE UNHAPPY KING OF THE HOOPOES CAME AT LAST TO THE COURT OF THE KING
BUT NOW THAT THERE MAY BE A MEMORIAL OF THE SERVICE WHICH ONCE YOU DID ME YOUR CROWNS OF GOLD SHALL BE CHANGED INTO CROWNS OF FEATHERS AND WITH THEM YOU MAY WALK UNHARMED UPON THE EARTH
A HALCYON TIME HAS COME TO MEAN
I AM READY SIR TO AGREE TO YOUR PROPOSAL BUT OF COURSE I CANNOT THINK OF CHANGING MY ABODE MY SWAMP IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOME THAT A MAIDEN EVER KNEW AND I COULD NOT GIVE IT UP FOR ANY ONE
IT WAS THE FIRST ROOM OF THE KING'S PALACE OF TREASURE AND IT WAS ALL OF SILVER PAVED WITH SILVER HEAPED WITH SILVER SHINING WITH SILVER WHITEBIRD'S EYES GLITTERED AND HE WANTED TO STOP AND TAKE SOME FOR HIMSELF
THE HOOPOES FLYING PAST AND CALLING TO THEM FEEBLY HE BEGGED THEM TO SHELTER HIM FROM THE BURNING RAYS THE KING OF THE HOOPOES GATHERED TOGETHER HIS WHOLE NATION
YOU ARE AN UNGRATEFUL BIRD MISS AND THE BAT IS RIGHT YOU DO NOT DESERVE THIS GENEROUS HOSPITALITY WHICH I HAVE OFFERED THIS GOODLY SHELTER WHICH YOU ASKED AWAY WITH YOU
IN THE MIDST OF WHICH THE PHOENIX BLENDED CRIMSON AND GOLD HIGH IN THE AIR ROSE THE FIRE DIFFUSING ABROAD ALL THE SWEET ODORS OF ARABY THE BLEST
FOR CENTURIES HOW MANY HE KNEW NOT HE HAD WATCHED THE BIRDS HATCH OUT OF THEIR LITTLE EGGS
I WILL WATCH AND PERHAPS I SHALL FIND OUT SOMETHING WORTH KNOWING MOTHER MAGPIE WAS THE WISEST AND THE SLYEST OF ALL THE BIRDS AND IT WAS ALWAYS WORTH WHILE AS WHITEBIRD KNEW TO TAKE LESSONS OF HER
OH SO LONELY HE HAD LIVED TOO LONG HE THOUGHT
FOR SHE KNEW THOSE BAD BIRDS AND SHE SAW THAT SHE MUST TRUST HER SECRET WITH WHITEBIRD SINCE HE HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED HALF THE TRUTH WELL IF YOU WILL PROMISE ME NOT TO LET ANY ONE ELSE KNOW NOT EVEN KING EAGLE I WILL TELL YOU SHE SAID
IN ALL HER SPLENDOR AMONG HER COUNSELORS HE HOPPED INTO THE HALL AND DROPPED THE LETTER INTO HER LAP THEN FLEW AWAY QUEEN BALKIS STARED AND STARED AT THE GREAT KING'S SEAL UPON THE MYSTERIOUS LETTER
HER ECHOED THE BAT FLAPPING HIS LEATHERY WINGS AND THE TWO HEARTLESS CREATURES FELL UPON THE POOR LITTLE DOVE AND DROVE HER OUT INTO THE DARK AND STORMY NIGHT
AND WHEN HE IS SMACKING HIS GREAT JAWS OVER HIS FOOD HE MAKES SUCH A GREEDY TERRIBLE NOISE THAT THE OTHER ANIMALS STEAL AWAY NERVOUSLY AND HIDE UNTIL IT SHALL BE MASTER CROCODILE'S
LET US KNOCK HERE SAID THE SHREWD BAT I KNOW THE OLD FELLOW IS NOT ASLEEP THIS IS HIS PROWLING HOUR AND BUT THAT IT IS A STORMY NIGHT HE WOULD BE ABROAD HUNTING WHAT HO MASTER OWL HE SQUEAKED
SOMETIMES THE GREEDY FELLOW SWALLOWS GREAT STONES AND CHUNKS OF WOOD
AND BADE HIS SON GATHER COURAGE AND PRIDE FOR THE ORDEAL FOR HE SAID IT WILL BE NO EASY MATTER MY SON TO BECOME THE GREATEST CHIEF OF THE OJIBWAYS MY FATHER
PERISHED IN THE CRUEL WAVES THAT VERY NIGHT WHEN THE SHIPWRECK OCCURRED
WHERE NOBODY SAW HIM AND NOBODY CARED BUT THE NIGHTINGALE'S CASE WAS REALLY QUITE TOO PITIFUL FANCY THE SWEETEST SINGER AMONG ALL THE BIRDS THE FAVORITE CHORISTER GOING ABOUT WITH BUT ONE EYE
THE WOODPECKER LOOKED SULKY AND STOOD UPON ONE LEG IT IS A GOOD THING TO BE NEAT SAID THE LORD BUT NOT IF IT COMES FROM SHIRKING A DUTY IT IS GOOD TO BE DAINTY
THAN SHE HAD EVER SUNG BEFORE AND AFTER THAT ALTHOUGH SHE WAS WEARY OH SO WEARY SHE SANG ALL NIGHT LONG
WHO WAS ABLE TO FIND WATER IN WHATSOEVER PLACE HE MIGHT BE RESTING THUS THE COCK AND THE HOOPOE BECAME SOLOMON'S CLOSEST COMPANIONS BUT OF THE TWO THE HOOPOE WAS HIS FAVORITE THE HOOPOE IS AN EASTERN BIRD AND WE DO NOT SEE HIM IN AMERICA
THE NIGHTINGALE WAS VERY INDIGNANT AT BEING ADDRESSED IN THIS FAMILIAR WAY BY A MISERABLE CRAWLING CREATURE WHO NOT ONLY COULD NOT FLY BUT WHO COULD NOT SING A NOTE
AND FAR FROM HIS DEAR WIFE
BUT THE PHOENIX WAS BATHED IN SUDDEN LIGHT IT WAS THE SIGNAL THE SIGNAL FOR WHICH HE HAD BEEN WAITING THOUGH HE KNEW IT NOT THE FIVE HUNDRED YEARS WERE ENDED THE MYSTERY OF HIS LIFE WAS ABOUT TO BE SOLVED
OTHER LANDS AND PEOPLES HAVE KNOWN SIMILAR CUSTOMS YOU REMEMBER HOW IN EARLY CHRISTIAN TIMES
LEAVE MY DWELLING PACK OFF INTO THE STORM AND SEE WHETHER OR NOT YOUR SILENCE WILL SOOTHE THE RAIN AND THE WIND BE OFF I SAY
ONE CAN READILY IMAGINE THE CHARM OF YOUR SOCIETY COME THEN MISS HERON WHY SHOULD WE NOT MAKE A HAPPY COUPLE IF WE CAN ONLY ARRANGE THIS ONE LITTLE FOOLISH MATTER BE MY WIFE COME LIVE WITH ME IN MY LOVELY NEST
O WHITEBIRD SHE CHUCKLED WHAT A SIGHT WHAT A SIGHT YOUR LOVELY COAT YOUR SPOTLESS FEATHERS OH YOU GREEDY GREEDY BLACKBIRD THEN HE WHO HAD BEEN WHITEBIRD LOOKED DOWN AT HIMSELF AND SAW WHAT A DREADFUL THING HAD HAPPENED
I WAS AFRAID OF SPOILING MY PRETTY BRIGHT COAT AND MY SILVER SHINING HOSE OH VAIN AND LAZY BIRD SAID THE LORD SADLY HAVE YOU NOTHING TO DO BUT SHOW OFF YOUR FINE CLOTHES AND GIVE YOURSELF AIRS
SAYING WHAT A GREAT CHIEF HE WOULD BE IN THE DAYS TO COME BUT ON THE NINTH MORNING WHEN THE FATHER PEEPED INTO THE LODGE TO SEE HOW BRAVELY HIS SON WAS FARING THE BOY TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE DOOR
WHITEBIRD'S YELLOW EYES COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL WHEN HE COULD SEE THE PLACE SEEMED FULL OF YELLOW EYES LIKE HIS OWN
NOR WERE THERE ANY HOLLOWS OR VALLEYS TO HOLD THE SEAS AND RIVERS FOUNTAINS AND POOLS WHICH THE WORLD OF MEN WOULD NEED IT MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN A STUPID AND UGLY EARTH IN THOSE DAYS WITH NO CHANCE FOR SWIMMING OR SAILING
HE HAD DISCOVERED A MEANS OF LOCOMOTION COMPARED TO WHICH THE MOST MAGNIFICENT RAILWAY COACHES AND THE RICHEST PALANQUINS OF INDIAN PRINCES WOULD SEEM POOR INDEED HE HAD CAUSED HIS GENII TO MAKE A SILKEN CARPET OF FOUR LEAGUES IN EXTENT
AND THE QUEEN OF THE HOOPOES BECAME VERY AIRY AND REFUSED TO SPEAK TO HER OWN COUSIN AND TO THE OTHER BIRDS WHO HAD ONCE BEEN HER FRIENDS THERE WAS A CERTAIN FOWLER WHO USED TO SET TRAPS FOR BIRDS
AS THE SUN SANK BELOW THE HORIZON EAGERLY THE PHOENIX SET ABOUT THE TASK WHICH WAS BEFORE HIM AT LAST HE MIGHT BUILD THE NEST WHICH TILL NOW HE HAD NEVER KNOWN
BUT OH HOW TIRED AND FRIGHTENED HE WAS MOTHER MAGPIE WAS SITTING ON A BUSH WAITING FOR HIM FOR SHE HAD GUESSED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE GREEDY BIRD AND WHEN SHE SAW HIM SHE GAVE A SQUAWK OF LAUGHTER
NOW WHEN THE WORLD WAS QUITE FINISHED AND THE BEAUTIFUL WATER SPARKLED AND GLINTED HERE AND THERE COOL AND REFRESHING THE LORD CALLED THE BIRDS TO HIM AND THANKED THEM FOR THEIR HELP PRAISING THEM FOR THEIR INDUSTRY AND ZEAL
FOR THIS WAS TO BE NO NEST OF STICKS AND STRAW OF PRECIOUS THINGS MUST IT BE MADE AND WELL HE KNEW WHERE SUCH WERE TO BE FOUND OF SILKY LEAVES AND GRASS INTERWOVEN WITH SPLINTERS OF SANDAL WOOD WERE THE WALLS
CHUCKLING OVER THE GREEDY FELLOW'S FAILURE
ALL THIS FLATTERY PLEASED THE OWL HE PUFFED AND RUFFLED HIMSELF TRYING TO LOOK AS WISE GALLANT AND BRAVE AS POSSIBLE HE PRESSED THE BAT TO HELP HIMSELF MORE GENEROUSLY TO THE VIANDS WHICH INVITATION THE SLY FELLOW WAS NOT SLOW TO ACCEPT
FEELING THE DRAGON'S HOT BREATH CLOSE BEHIND FRIZZLING HIS FEATHERS AND BLINDING HIS EYES WITH SMOKE HE SEEMED LIKE TO BE ROASTED ALIVE IN THIS HORRIBLE UNDERGROUND OVEN BUT OH THERE WAS THE HOLE CLOSE BEFORE HIM POUF
BUT YOU SEE HE DID NOT REALLY DESERVE THIS HONOR BECAUSE HE WAS AT HEART A GREEDY BIRD AND THEREFORE A GREAT SHAME CAME UPON HIM AND AFTER THAT HE WAS NEVER PROUD NOR HAPPY ANY MORE
AND SPOKE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ALL THOSE LONG DAYS HE WAS VERY THIN AND PALE AND HIS VOICE SOUNDED WEAK MY FATHER HE SAID I HAVE SLEPT
SHE MANAGED TO COCK HER HEAD THE OTHER WAY WHENEVER SHE MET A FRIEND AND SHE ALWAYS FLEW PAST ANY STRANGER SO FAST THAT HE NEVER SAW THE EMPTY SOCKET WHERE HER OTHER PRETTY EYE SHOULD BE BUT ONE DAY THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AMONG THE BIRDS
ONCE I TRACED MY WAY PAINFULLY BY FOREST PATHS THROUGH BOG AND BRAKE AND TANGLED BRIER BUT NOW MY PATHWAYS ARE IN THE BRIGHT CLEAR AIR WHERE NEVER THORN CAN TEAR NOR BEAST CAN FOLLOW
THE PHOENIX HAD SEEN MANY GENERATIONS OF MEN GROW UP DO GOOD OR EVIL DEEDS AND DIE SOMETIMES LEAVING GRAND MONUMENTS UPON THE EARTH SOMETIMES DISAPPEARING FROM KNOWLEDGE LIKE THE VERY BIRDS LEAVING SCARCELY A TRACE BEHIND
HE HAS SHOWN PITY SEEING THAT I WAS OBEDIENT TO MY FATHER AND DID MY BEST TO PLEASE HIM NOW I AM TO BE NO LONGER AN INDIAN BOY I MUST TAKE THE SHAPE WHICH THE SPIRIT HAS GIVEN ME
FOR THE BLINDWORM WAS VERY TIMID AND KEPT HIMSELF CAREFULLY HIDDEN IN HIS BURROW OF SOFT SOIL AS IF HE HALF SUSPECTED THE NIGHTINGALE'S PLANS DAY AFTER DAY THE NIGHTINGALE KEPT EAGER WATCH UPON HIS MOVEMENTS
FOR YEARS HE HAD NOT VENTURED WITHIN SIGHT OF MEN AND HE KNEW THAT MOST OF THEM HAD FORGOTTEN HIS EXISTENCE NAY EVEN DENIED THAT HE HAD EVER LIVED HE FEARED THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE A SINGLE HEART IN ALL THE WORLD THAT THRILLED TO HIS NAME
FOR HE BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS THE WAY TO MAKE HIM THE NOBLEST OF HIS RACE
MORE GLORIOUS THAN GOLD MORE PRECIOUS THAN RARE JEWELS I SAW QUEEN BALKIS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF QUEENS TELL ME OF THIS QUEEN SAID SOLOMON LOOSENING HIS ROUGH GRASP UPON THE HOOPOE
THEN INDEED THE CROCODILE WAS ANGRY HE DETERMINED TO GO AND SEE NZAMBI THE WISE WITCH PRINCESS ABOUT THE MATTER
SHE FLUTTERED INTO THE TOP OF THE OAK TREE AND FROM THERE HOPPED DOWN FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH FROM TWIG TO TWIG UNTIL SHE WAS DIRECTLY OVER THE SLEEPER'S UGLY HEAD OVER THE ONE CLOSED EYE THEN WHIRR
THERE WERE FOLK WAITING TO RECEIVE THEM MANY LITTLE CHILDREN AND SOME ELDERS OF CHILDLIKE HEART WHO TOOK THE ASHES AND LAID THEM REVERENTLY IN THE SHRINE THE PHOENIX WAS NOT FORGOTTEN HE WAS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN SO LONG AS THE WORLD SHOULD LAST
COME STORKIE DEAR SHE SAID COME HOME TO YOUR DEAR WIFE'S HOUSE AND I WILL BE GOOD BUT THE STORK DID NOT ANSWER HE WAS SO ANGRY SO THE HERON FLEW HOME IN A HUFF AND IF YOU ARE NOT ASLEEP WHEN YOU GET AS FAR AS THIS
KNOWING WELL THE CRUELTY OF THE WINDS
BUT HOW CAN I GO IF I DO THE OTHER BIRDS WILL DISCOVER THAT I HAVE BUT ONE EYE AND THEN HOW THE DISAGREEABLE CREATURES WILL LAUGH AT ME OH DEAR OH DEAR WHAT SHALL I DO I CANNOT GO NO
NOW AMONG THE OJIBWAYS WHEN A BOY WAS ALMOST BIG ENOUGH TO BECOME A WARRIOR BEFORE HE COULD GO OUT WITH THE OTHER BRAVES TO THE HUNT OR TO WAR THERE WAS A GREAT TRIAL WHICH HE MUST UNDERGO
YOU MAY GO ON WITH THE STORY BY YOURSELF PERFECTLY WELL YOU MAY GO ON JUST AS LONG AS YOU CAN KEEP AWAKE FOR THE TALE HAS NO END NO END AT ALL IT IS STILL GOING ON TO THIS VERY DAY THE STORK STILL LIVES LONELY ON HIS HOUSE TOP
GALAHAD AND OTHER BOYS HAD TO FAST AND WATCH BY THEIR ARMOR DURING THE LONG NIGHT HOURS BEFORE THEY COULD BECOME KNIGHTS TO WEAR SPURS AND SHIELD AND SWORD
AND SHE THOUGHT HOW PLEASANTLY THEY MIGHT HAVE ARRANGED THE MATTER IF ONLY SHE HAD BEEN MORE MODERATE SO SHE SPREAD HER BEAUTIFUL BLUE WINGS AND FLEW TO THE HOUSETOP WHERE MISTER STORK LIVED AND PERCHING ON THE CHIMNEY SHE SAID OH MISTER STORK
THERE ARE VERY FEW BIRDS WHO HAVE BEEN THOUGHT WORTHY TO DRESS ALL IN BEAUTIFUL WHITE FOR THAT IS THE GREATEST HONOR WHICH A BIRD CAN HAVE SO LIKE THE SWAN AND THE DOVE
THE POOR DOVE WAS SO TIRED THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY EAT BUT THE GREEDY BAT'S SPIRITS ROSE AS SOON AS HE SAW THE VIANDS SPREAD BEFORE HIM
HE BORE HIS HEAD HIGH WITH ITS BURDEN AND HIS HEART WAS FILLED WITH PIOUS JOY IT WAS GOOD TO BE A PHOENIX GOOD GOOD AT LAST HE REACHED THE PLACE WHICH UNKNOWINGLY HE SOUGHT THE SUN ALONE HAD BEEN HIS GUIDE
MY HOW PRETTY SHE IS I WONDER I NEVER NOTICED HER BEFORE AND HOW LONESOME SHE MUST BE THERE ALL BY HERSELF IN SUCH A NASTY MOIST MUSHY SQUSHY OLD SWAMP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TENT PAINTING HIS BREAST A BRILLIANT RED AS INDIANS DO IN WAR TIME AND AS HE DAUBED ON THE COLORS HE TALKED TO HIMSELF HE SPOKE SOFTLY YET NOT WITH THE WEAK VOICE OF A STARVING LAD
AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HE WAS HONORED AND ADORED BY THOUSANDS WHO HAD NEVER EVEN SEEN HIS GLORY BUT NOW NOW ALL WAS CHANGED HE WAS GROWN OLD AND TIRED HE FELT HIS LONELINESS AND HE LONGED TO DIE
SOLOMON WAS EVER SEEKING TO GROW EVEN WISER THE BETTER TO KNOW THE WONDERS OF GOD'S WORLD AND THE WAYS OF ALL CREATURES HE UNDERTOOK MANY JOURNEYS NOT AS WE ORDINARY POOR MORTALS TRAVEL
DOWN SHE POUNCED UPON THE BLINDWORM AND BEFORE THE CREATURE HAD A CHANCE TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING THE NIGHTINGALE HAD STOLEN HIS EYE AND HAD POPPED IT INTO PLACE IN THE EMPTY SOCKET ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER BEAK HA HA
THE CYNICAL OLD CROW CROAKED DISAGREEABLY THE FURTHER AWAY FROM MEN I AM THE BETTER I AM PLEASED LAST OF ALL THE COCK WHO SINGS IN THE MORNING CHANTED HIS JOYOUS SONG THINK OF YOUR CREATOR
YES NO ONE SHALL EVER CATCH ME NAPPING YOU CANNOT HELP YOURSELF SAID THE BLINDWORM YOU CANNOT KEEP AWAKE YOU WILL DROWSE IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING I SHALL YET FIND YOU ASLEEP SOME NIGHT AND THEN BEWARE
IT SEEMED THAT SOON THERE WOULD BE NO MORE HOOPOES LEFT TO BEWAIL THEIR SAD FATE AT LAST THE FEW WHO STILL LIVED GATHERED TOGETHER AND HELD A MEETING TO CONSIDER WHAT SHOULD BE DONE FOR THEIR MINDS WERE FILLED WITH SORROW AND DISMAY
AND WE WILL LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER ON THE CHIMNEY TOP FAR ABOVE THE OTHER BIRDS AND I WILL NEVER BE CROSS AGAIN BUT THE HERON ANSWERED AWAY WITH YOU I WANT TO GO TO SLEEP I AM TIRED OF YOUR CROAKING VOICE LEAVE ME ALONE
ROWING OR FISHING BUT AS YET THERE WAS NO ONE TO THINK ANYTHING ABOUT IT NO ONE WHO WOULD LONG TO SWIM SAIL ROW AND FISH FOR THIS WAS LONG BEFORE MEN WERE CREATED
AND TOLD HIM ALL HER TROUBLE GREAT WAS THE INDIGNATION OF THAT NOBLE BIRD FOR HIS FLATTERY AND HIS CRUELTY LET THE BAT NEVER PRESUME TO FLY ABROAD UNTIL THE SUN GOES DOWN HE CRIED
FIERCELY THEY BLEW THE LIGHTNING FLASHED AND THE SEA RAN HIGH AND IN THE MIDST OF THE HORRIBLE TUMULT THE GOOD SHIP WENT TO THE BOTTOM WITH ALL ON BOARD
THAT WOULD BE VERY PLEASANT FOR HE WAS A GOOD SORT OF FELLOW WITH NICE LONG LEGS AND THERE WERE FISH ENOUGH IN THE WATER FOR TWO BESIDES HE COULD THEN DO THE FISHING FOR THE FAMILY AND MOREOVER
DID YOU NOT LAUGH AT ME WHEN YOU SAW ME SADLY SITTING ON THE TREE MOURNING BECAUSE I COULD NOT GO TO THE WEDDING NOW I HAVE STOLEN YOUR EYE AND I CAN SEE FAMOUSLY BUT YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN SEE ME SITTING SADLY ON THE TREE
WHERE HE WAS TO LIE WITHOUT FOOD OR DRINK FOR TWELVE LONG DAYS WAITING FOR A MESSAGE FROM THE GUARDIAN SPIRIT WHOSE LOVE WAS TO BE THE REWARD OF SUCH A TRIAL WHEN THE TIME CAME
EACH OF US A GOLDEN CROWN ON HIS HEAD KING SOLOMON SMILED AND ANSWERED CROWNS OF GOLD SHALL YOU HAVE BUT YOU ARE FOOLISH BIRDS MY HOOPOES AND WHEN THE EVIL DAYS SHALL COME UPON YOU AND YOU SEE THE FOLLY OF YOUR DESIRE
WHAT CAN IT BE DEAR FRIEND THAT IS TROUBLING YOU THIS DAY SHE SAID AMIABLY SURELY NO ONE WOULD BE SO RUDE OR RASH AS TO OFFEND THE KING OF CONGO RIVER BUT TELL ME YOUR TROUBLE AND PERHAPS I CAN ADVISE YOU
LITTLE RIPPLING BROOK OR COOL SWEET FOUNTAIN RAINDROPS FALLING SCANTILY FROM THE LEAVES SHALL BE YOUR DRINK
YET MAKE TRIAL OF ME IF YOU WISH
HE WILL NOT TOUCH THE HEN EVEN IF SHE SHOULD VENTURE INTO HIS VERY JAWS AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT THE BLACK MEN OF THE CONGO RIVER WILL TELL YOU
KING SOLOMON LOOKED KINDLY UPON THE KING OF THE HOOPOES AND SAID BEHOLD DID I NOT WARN YOU OF YOUR FOLLY IN DESIRING TO HAVE CROWNS OF GOLD VANITY AND PRIDE HAVE BEEN YOUR RUIN
DO NOTHING OF THE KIND
AND AS YOU DECLINED TO HELP IN BUILDING THE WATER BASINS OF THE WORLD SO YOU SHALL NEVER SIP FROM THEM WHEN YOU ARE THIRSTY
WHAT WAS ONCE SO DEAR
WHICH FLOATED ON THE WAVES AS SAFELY AS ANY LITTLE BOAT AND WHILE THEIR CHILDREN THE BABY HALCYONS LAY IN THIS ROCKING CRADLE FOR SEVEN DAYS IN THE HEART OF WINTER
AND NO ONE SHALL SEE MORE OF THE CEREMONY THAN I I SHALL BE ABLE TO TELL JUST EXACTLY HOW THE BRIDE IS DRESSED HOW EVERY LITTLE FEATHER IS ARRANGED AND HOW SHE LOOKS AFTER PARSON CROW HAS PRONOUNCED THE BLESSING
AS THE HEN HAS SAID SH
HE HAS DISCOVERED YOUR ABSENCE AND IN HIS RIGHTEOUS ANGER WILL PUNISH YOU SEVERELY LEAD ME TO HIM REPLIED THE HOOPOE I KNOW THAT HE WILL FORGIVE ME WHEN HE HEARS WHERE I HAVE BEEN AND WHAT I HAVE TO TELL HIM
WHISPERED THE CROCODILE NERVOUSLY
AND IN A FEW WEEKS OUT OF THESE WILL SCAMPER SIXTY LITTLE WIGGLY CROCODILES YOUR DEAR HOMELY SCALY HUNGRY MOUTHED CHILDREN YES
AND WHEN HE BECAME USED TO THIS HE LOOKED AGAIN AND SAW THAT THESE WERE GOLDEN COINS AND THAT THIS WAS A CAVERN ALL OF GOLD OH SUCH A WONDERFUL SIGHT OH SUCH A GOLDEN DREAM
OH DEAR MISS HERON HE CRIED
GIVE ME FOOD OR I DIE BUT AGAIN THE FATHER REFUSED IT IS BUT A DAY NOW HE SAID BUT A FEW SHORT HOURS
THE GOLD AND CRIMSON ONE WHO WHEN HE WENT ABROAD FILLED ALL CREATURES WITH AWE OF HIS BEAUTY AND WISDOM AND MYSTERY SO THAT THEY DARED NOT COME NEAR BUT FOLLOWED HIM AFAR OFF HUSHING THEIR SONG AND ADORING SILENTLY
BUT OF ALL THE WINGED SINGERS WHO SPOKE THAT DAY IN THE GARDEN THE WISE KING CHOSE TO HAVE EVER NEAR HIM THE COCK BECAUSE HE HAD SPOKEN WORDS OF PIETY AND THE NIMBLE HOOPOE BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE TO PLUNGE HIS CLEAR GAZE
PICK PICK THE HEN BEGAN TO SCRATCH AND PECK UPON THE ROUGH BARK OF THE LOG
ONCE UPON A TIME OUR FRIEND BLACKBIRD WHO COMES FIRST OF THE FEATHERED BROTHERS IN THE SPRING WAS NOT BLACK AT ALL NO INDEED HE WAS WHITE WHITE AS FEATHER SNOW NEW FALLEN IN THE MEADOW
NOW THOUGH THE HEN HAD HAD SO NARROW AN ESCAPE IT HAD NOT SUFFICIENTLY TAUGHT HER A LESSON A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS ONCE MORE SHE WENT DOWN TO THE RIVER
AND HIS FACE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL TO SEE DESPITE ITS PALE THINNESS MY FATHER HAS ENDED MY INDIAN LIFE HE SAID MY FATHER TOO AMBITIOUS
IN THOSE DAYS THE NIGHTINGALE ALSO HAD BUT ONE EYE AS FOR THE BLINDWORM IT MATTERED VERY LITTLE FOR HE WAS A HOMELY CREATURE CONTENT TO CRAWL ABOUT IN THE DARK UNDERGROUND
ONCE HE HAD BEEN PROUD OF HIS SOLITARINESS AND OF HIS UNUSUAL BEAUTY WHICH CAUSED SUCH WONDER WHEN HE WENT ABROAD BUT NOW HE WAS OLD AND WEAK AND WEARY AND HE WAS LONELY
THERE WAS A TIME SO THE INDIANS SAY A VERY EARLY TIME LONG LONG BEFORE COLUMBUS DISCOVERED AMERICA EVEN BEFORE HISTORIES BEGAN TO BE WRITTEN
OH HOW HAPPY I AM BUT THE POOR BLINDWORM BLIND INDEED FROM THAT DAY FORTH BEGAN TO CRY AND LAMENT BEGGING THE NIGHTINGALE TO GIVE HIM BACK HIS EYE NAY SAID THE NIGHTINGALE
HAD COMPLETED BUT HALF THEIR JOURNEY WHEN A TERRIBLE STORM AROSE THE WICKED WINDS HAD ESCAPED FROM THE CONTROL OF GOOD OLD A EOLUS AND WERE RUSHING DOWN UPON THE OCEAN TO PUNISH
MY FATHER GASPED THE POOR BOY I CANNOT BEAR IT ANOTHER DAY I AM NOT FIT TO BE A GREAT CHIEF I HAVE FAILED
AND WEAR IT TO JENNY WREN'S WEDDING THEN NO ONE WILL EVER DISCOVER MY MISFORTUNE NOW THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT SCHEME
I SHALL BE SO MUCH HAPPIER AS A BIRD FREE FROM HUMAN PAIN AND SORROW I WILL CHEER YOU WITH MY MERRY SONGS OH I HAVE BEEN HUNGRY
WHITEBIRD HOPPED IN EAGERLY AND AWAY BACK IN ONE CORNER OF THE CAVE HE FOUND A LITTLE ROUND HOLE AS THE MAGPIE HAD SAID A HOLE NOT MUCH BIGGER THAN AN APPLE IT MUST HAVE BEEN A TIGHT SQUEEZE FOR FAT MOTHER MAGPIE WHITEBIRD HOPPED THROUGH THE HOLE
COURAGE BOY FOR THE FEW HOURS THAT REMAIN
I WAS BEATEN BY THE STORM AND YOU TOOK ME IN I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU GAVE ME YOUR BEST TO EAT I CANNOT FLATTER NOR MAKE PRETTY SPEECHES LIKE THE BAT I NEVER LEARNED SUCH MANNERS
BESIDES IT MADE HER ANGRY TO THINK THAT HE KNEW HER SECRET AND TALKED ALOUD ABOUT IT
STRAIGHT TO THE WADY SHADY SWAMP WHERE MISS HERON WAS STANDING ON ONE LEG WAITING FOR HER SUPPER TO GET ITSELF CAUGHT AHEM CROAKED MISTER STORK WAVING HIS WING POLITELY GOOD EVENING MISS HERON
AS ON THE NIGHT BEFORE ONE RADIANT BEAM SEEMED TO SINGLE OUT THE LONELY PALM ONE SHAFT OF FLAME PIERCED TO THE NEST WHEREON THE PHOENIX SAT IT WAS THE FINAL SIGNAL TO THE BIRD OF THE SUN
BUT HOW HORRIBLY MOIST IT IS DOWN HERE I SHOULD THINK THAT YOUR NICE STRAIGHT LEGS WOULD GROW CROOKED WITH RHEUMATISM NOW I HAVE A COMFORTABLE DRY HOUSE ON THE ROOF POUF GRUNTED MISS HERON DISDAINFULLY
HA HA CRIED THE CROCODILE IN HIS HARSH VOICE YOU TOOK ME FOR A LOG JUST AS THE OTHER SILLY CREATURES DO BUT I AM NO LOG MISSUS HEN AS YOU SHALL SOON SEE
IMMEDIATELY THE GREAT BIRD BEGAN TO FAN THE SWEET SMELLING MASS WITH HIS WINGS THE BURNING RAY GREW BRIGHTER A PUNGENT WONDERFUL AROMA OF MINGLED FRAGRANCES FILLED THE AIR
AND SINGING LITTLE BITS OF POETRY ABOUT HIMSELF TO ANY ONE WHO WOULD LISTEN HO HO HO HEE JUST LOOK AT ME HE PIPED AND COCKED HIS LITTLE EYES ABOUT IN EVERY DIRECTION TO SEE WHO MIGHT BE ADMIRING HIS WONDROUS WHITENESS
BUT NOW I SHALL GET MY FOOD SO EASILY SO PLEASANTLY ON MOUNTAINS AND IN THE FIELDS OH ONCE I WAS THIRSTY BUT NOW THE DEW IS MINE AND THE LITTLE SPRINGS
IN THIS WAY THE REMAINING HOOPOES WERE SAVED FOR WHEN THE FOWLERS SAW THAT THEY NO LONGER WORE CROWNS OF GOLD UPON THEIR HEADS THEY CEASED TO HUNT THEM AS THEY HAD BEEN DOING
CONTENTMENT IS THE GREATEST HAPPINESS IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR MOST PEOPLE NEVER TO HAVE BEEN BORN CROONED THE MELANCHOLY TURTLE DOVE THE HAPPY LITTLE SWALLOW GAVE HER OPINION DO GOOD
BUT HE SAT PERFECTLY STILL UNTIL THE MAGPIE HAD STOWED THE COIN SAFELY IN THE HOLLOW TREE AND HAD HOPPED AWAY AS IF UPON AN UNFINISHED ERRAND AHA THERE IS MORE THEN I WILL WATCH TO SEE WHAT COMES NEXT SAID WHITEBIRD AND HE WAITED
BUT WHILE HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF THESE HOWS ONCE MORE THE HEN HAD MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND WAS PELTING BACK TO HER BARNYARD AS FAST AS SHE COULD GO
WHO IS WAITING TO CATCH HER WITH HER EYES CLOSED ONCE UPON A TIME WHEN THE WORLD WAS VERY NEW THE BLINDWORM WAS NOT QUITE BLIND BUT HAD ONE GOOD EYE MOREOVER
PRETENDING TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING A THOUSAND MILES AWAY AND SHE LOVED TO LOOK AT HER SLENDER LONG LEGGED BLUE REFLECTION IN THE WATER FOR THE LADY HERON WAS JUST A LITTLE BIT VAIN
WHICH ADVANCED AND RETREATED SEETHING AROUND HIS BODY BUT A DIFFERENT FATE WAS TO BE HERS AS SHE LEAPED FORWARD
AND SURELY AS THEY ARE THE NEAREST NEIGHBORS OF THE BIG REPTILE THEY OUGHT TO KNOW IF ANY ONE DOES NOW THIS IS THE STORY WHICH THEY TELL TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CROCODILE WILL NOT EAT THE HEN
FAREWELL DEAR FATHER I AM SO HAPPY HE STRETCHED HIS BROWN WINGS AS EASILY AS IF HE HAD WORN THEM ALL HIS LIFE AND SINGING A SWEET SONG
AS SOON AS IT WAS LIGHT SHE ROSE AND HASTENED TO THE SEASHORE TREMBLING WITH A HORRIBLE DREAD STANDING ON THE VERY SPOT WHENCE SHE HAD LAST SEEN THE FATED SHIP
CORONEL GOT ON HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF EARSHOT HE BEGAN TO LAUGH SPASM AFTER SPASM SHOOK HIM NO SOONER HAD HE COMPOSED HIMSELF TO GRAVITY
NOTHING MUCH I SUPPOSE HE WAITED NERVOUSLY WONDERING IF HYACINTH WOULD REALISE THAT ALL WAS MEANT TO INCLUDE MORE PARTICULARLY BELVANE HYACINTH DREW A STOOL UP TO HER FATHER'S CHAIR AND SAT DOWN VERY CLOSE TO HIM
HE TOLD HER OF HIS SECRET JOURNEY TO THE KING OF BARODIA'S TENT HE TOLD HER OF THE KING OF BARODIA'S LETTER
WAS IT FAIR TO DISAPPOINT ONE WHO HAD PERHAPS SOME LITTLE GROUNDS FOR AFTER ALL HE HAD BEEN NO MORE GALLANT THAN WAS CUSTOMARY FROM A PRINCE AND A GENTLEMAN TO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IT WAS HER OWN FAULT IF SHE HAD MISTAKEN HIS INTENTIONS
HE SAT UP SUDDENLY AND STARED AT CORONEL IT WAS THAT OLD WOMAN DID IT YOU MARK MY WORDS CORONEL SHE DID IT WHY SHOULD SHE
POOR LITTLE HYACINTH LEFT ALL ALONE BUT THERE SHE HAD HAD THE COUNTESS BELVANE A WOMAN OF GREAT EXPERIENCE TO HELP HER BELVANE SHOULD HE RISK IT HOW MUCH HAD SHE THOUGHT OF HIM WHILE HE WAS AWAY
CORONEL STOPPED YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS'S COMMANDS HE BEGAN RATHER COLDLY THERE WAS AN OMINOUS SNIFFING FROM THE BUSHES CORONEL SAID AN UNHAPPY VOICE AT LAST
AND WITH A CURTSEY SHE WAS GONE CORONEL EXCHANGED A GLANCE WITH HYACINTH I'M ENJOYING THIS HE SEEMED TO SAY WELL SHE ANNOUNCED I MUST BE GOING IN TOO THERE'LL BE MUCH TO SEE ABOUT
SHE WOULD FIND HIM STROKABLE AND THE LION IN HIM
IT WILL ANNOY YOUR FATHER BUT ONE CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY OH I CAN SEE MYSELF ENJOYING THIS THEY GOT UP AND WANDERED BACK ALONG WIGGS'S PATH HAND IN HAND I'M ALMOST AFRAID TO LEAVE THE FOREST SAID HYACINTH
ALREADY THEN HE HAD SUFFERED IN HER SERVICE SO AT LEAST HE WOULD SAY AND SO POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE CORONEL HAD THOUGHT HIM FUNNY BUT WOMEN HAD NOT MUCH SENSE OF HUMOUR AS A RULE
WE DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE KNOWN YET SHE SAID SHYLY BUT YOU HAVE GUESSED OUR SECRET YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS SHE LOOKED MODESTLY AT THE GROUND AND FEELING FOR HER RELUCTANT LOVER'S HAND WENT ON
EQUALLY CERTAIN WHAT THEN HAD HAPPENED THERE WAS ONLY ONE ANSWER TO HER QUESTION THE BAD WISH HAD BEEN GRANTED TO SOMEONE ELSE TO WHOM
BY SUCH ROUGH AND TUMBLE METHODS AS THESE THE FACT THAT HIS TAIL HAD CAUGHT IN SOMETHING HELPED HIM TO DECIDE BELVANE WAS UP TO HIM IN AN INSTANT THERE THERE SHE SAID SOOTHINGLY
WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK THAT AFTERNOON AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN CORONEL POINTED OUT THAT AS SHE HAD TURNED PRINCE UDO INTO INTO A A QUITE SO SAID UDO
NOW FATHER SAID HYACINTH LATER ON WHEN MERRIWIG HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHES AND REFRESHED HIMSELF YOU'VE GOT TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT'S REALLY OVER YES YES IT'S ALL OVER
STRIKING I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU SEE TO ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
HENRY HAVING CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE CHIEF ARMOURER'S DAUGHTER HAD ACCEPTED WITHOUT ANY FALSE PRIDE AND HAD FREQUENTLY DROPPED IN TO SUPPER THEREAFTER NOW THAT THE WAR WAS OVER HE FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT TEAR HIMSELF AWAY
I RODE SAID CORONEL IT'S A SECRET HE ADDED
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO JOLLY WE CAN DO WHAT WE LIKE AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT DOESN'T COME OFF SO JUST FOR FUN LET'S THINK OF SOMETHING TO PAY HER OUT I FEEL I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY TO DAY ALL RIGHT WE WON'T HURT HER WE'LL HUMOUR HER
WHY NOT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD CALLED FOR HIM WHAT DEVOTION IT SHOWED IF HE CAME TO HER EVEN NOW IN HIS PRESENT STATE OF BAD HEALTH SHE WAS IN TROUBLE
WITH MORE CONTROL OVER HER COUNTENANCE THAN THE OTHERS
OR SHALL I STAY HERE IN THE COUNTESS'S GARDEN AND AMUSE MYSELF WITH UDO ANYHOW I'LL GIVE YOU AN HOUR ALONE TOGETHER FIRST THE CAVALCADE DREW UP IN FRONT OF THE CASTLE HANDKERCHIEFS FLUTTERED TO THEM FROM THE WALLS TRUMPETS WERE BLOWN HOUNDS BAYED
BUTTERFLY BUT WIGGS HAD LET GO HER HAND AND WAS RUNNING BACK TO THE PALACE SHE WANTED TO BE ALONE TO THINK THIS OUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
THIS IS A PAINFUL CHAPTER FOR ME TO WRITE MERCIFULLY IT IS TO BE A SHORT ONE LATER ON I SHALL BECOME USED TO THE SITUATION INCLINED EVEN TO DWELL UPON ITS HUMOROUS SIDE
IT HAPPENED LIKE THIS ONCE MORE HE TOLD THE STORY OF HIS MIDNIGHT VISIT AND OF THE KING'S LETTER TO HIM BUT YOUR MAJESTY CRIED CORONEL
WIGGS HE SAID SOLEMNLY IF EVER YOU CAN DO
HE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED BY THE CHIEF ARMOURER OF BARODIA AT FULL LENGTH ON THE WET GRASS SEARCHING FOR TRACKS THE CHIEF ARMOURER A KINDLY MAN
HE ADDED BITTERLY HOW DID IT HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW CORONEL I JUST WENT TO SLEEP
AFTER ALL AGAIN WHY NOT MARRY THE COUNTESS IT WAS ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THERE WAS ANYTHING IN CORONEL'S NONSENSE BUT ONE NEVER KNEW NOT THAT HE WAS MARRYING HER OUT OF FEAR NO CERTAINLY NOT IT WAS SIMPLY A CHIVALROUS WHIM ON HIS PART
SAID HYACINTH I FELT SOMEHOW THAT IT MUST BE COMING BECAUSE YOU'VE SEEN SO MUCH OF EACH OTHER LATELY WIGGS AND I HAVE OFTEN TALKED ABOUT IT TOGETHER WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE CHILD THOUGHT BELVANE SHE ISN'T A CHILD AT ALL SHE'S GROWN UP
WAIT TILL HE HAS SEEN THEM MY DEAR SAID MERRIWIG WITH A CHUCKLE HE HAS SEEN THEM FATHER WHAT YOU INVITED HIM HERE
REALLY FRANKLY HE ASKED
THEN I SHALL SAY NOTHING MUCH ONLY CORONEL AND SUCH A CLEVER OH I HAVE MY IDEAS SAID CORONEL WELL I'LL BE OUT OF THE WAY SOMEWHERE I THINK I'LL GO FOR A WALK IN THE FOREST
THAT YOU CANNOT ASK FOR THE WHISKERS OF THE KING OF BARODIA THERE IS ONLY ONE MAN WHO COULD HAVE GOT THOSE TRULY AN EXCELLENT YOUNG MAN WELL WE'LL ARRANGE SOMETHING SAID MERRIWIG LOOKING PLEASED
HYACINTH PUT OUT HER HAND AND CORONEL PRESSED IT ENCOURAGINGLY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE UDO SHE SAID
AND THEN SAID UDO I JUMPED QUICKLY TO THE RIGHT AND WHIRLING MY NO WAIT A BIT THAT WAS LATER I JUMPED QUICKLY TO MY LEFT YES I REMEMBER IT NOW IT WAS MY LEFT I JUMPED QUICKLY TO MY LEFT AND WHIRLING MY
PRINCE CORONEL WILL BE STAYING HERE SAID THE PRINCESS PREPARE A ROOM FOR HIM AND SOME REFRESHMENT FOR US BOTH AND IF THEY DISCUSSED THOSE THINGS IN THE SERVANTS HALLS OF THOSE DAYS
HE MUST BE LONGING TO TELL YOU THAT OH HE'LL HAVE A HUNDRED THINGS TO TELL YOU FIRST BUT THEN WHEN HE SAYS AND WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING HERE WHILE I'VE BEEN AWAY NOTHING MUCH I SUPPOSE THEN YOU CAN SAY
ROGER SCURVILEGS FRANKLY BREAKS DOWN OVER IT THAT ABOMINABLE WOMAN HE SAYS MEANING OF COURSE BELVANE AND HE HAS HYSTERICS FOR MORE THAN A PAGE LET US DESCRIBE IT CALMLY
VERY WELL I SHALL GO STRAIGHT TO THE PRINCESS AND SHE WILL UNMASK YOU BEFORE THE PEOPLE BELVANE SMILED HAPPILY ONE DOES NOT OFTEN GET SUCH A CHANCE
ALL APPARENTLY BUSY ABOUT SOMETHING WHICH BROUGHT THEM FOR A MOMENT IN SIGHT OF THE NEWLY ARRIVED PRINCE AND THEN WHISKED THEM OFF HAND TO MOUTH AND SHOULDERS SHAKING BY ONE OF THESE
UDO AND I HERE SHE SQUEEZED THE HAND AND FINDING IT WAS CORONEL'S TOOK UDO'S BOLDLY WITHOUT ANY MORE MAIDENLY NONSENSE UDO AND I LOVE EACH OTHER SAY SOMETHING UDO
IT SEEMED THAT SHE HAD CHOSEN THE EXACT MOMENT IN THE THROES OF COMPOSITION BELVANE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE APPLE PIE BED SO ABSORBING IS OUR PROFESSION
TO LEARN THAT ON HER DAY WIGGS COULD BE AS BAD AS ANYBODY I MEAN REALLY BAD TO TEAR YOUR FROCK TO READ BOOKS WHICH YOU OUGHT TO BE DUSTING
SEE I HAVE BROUGHT THESE HOME FOR YOU HE PRODUCED FROM HIS POCKET A SMALL PACKET IN TISSUE PAPER OH HOW EXCITING WHATEVER CAN IT BE MERRIWIG UNWRAPPED THE PAPER AND DISCLOSED A COUPLE OF GINGER WHISKERS
ONCE MORE I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY HER WELL YOU MUST PLEASE YOURSELF BUT YOU HAVE COMPROMISED HER SEVERELY WITH THAT STORY POOR INNOCENT GIRL WELL LET'S FORGET ABOUT IT AND NOW TELL ME HOW DO YOU LIKE EURALIA
SHE HELD HER BREATH EXPECTING A THUNDERCLAP OR SOME OTHER OUTWARD TOKEN
AND WHERE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH ONE MAY COME TO LOVE
BUT I GET NO ASSISTANCE FROM ROGER AT THIS POINT HE PRETENDS THAT HE HAS A MIND FAR ABOVE THE GOSSIP OF THE LOWER ORDERS I SAY SAID CORONEL AS THEY WENT UP THE GRAND STAIRCASE I AM NOT A PRINCE YOU KNOW DON'T SAY I HAVE DECEIVED YOU
THREE NIGHTS LATER WITH MALICE AFORETHOUGHT AND TO THE COMFORT OF THE KING'S ENEMIES AND THE PREJUDICE OF THE SAFETY OF THE REALM SHE MADE
WERE BEYOND EXPECTATION AFTER WRESTLING FOR HALF AN HOUR THE COUNTESS SPENT THE NIGHT IN A GARDEN HAMMOCK COMPOSING A BITTER ODE
EAT YOUR YOUNG CARNATIONS BELVANE ADORED HER GARDEN BUT SHE WAS SUSTAINED BY THE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS ONLY JULY JUST NOW SHE POINTED THIS OUT TO HIM
BUT HE SOON RECOVERED HIMSELF EVEN SUPPOSING JUST FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT I AM A RABBIT I STILL HAVE SOMETHING UP MY SLEEVE I'LL COME AND
SAID UDO STIFFLY WELL PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT I HOPE THAT NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO YOU ON THE WAY UDO WHO WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE PALACE TURNED ROUND WITH A STARTLED LOOK WHAT DO YOU MEAN
HE WOULD SAY THESE ARE MATTERS FOR MEN TO DISCUSS BUT HYACINTH WOULD KNOW QUITE WELL WHY SHE HAD BEEN SENT OUT AND WOULD CERTAINLY TELL CORONEL THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER AFTERWARDS IT REALLY LOOKED AS IF CORONEL WOULD HAVE TO BE LET INTO THE SECRET TOO
SHE WAS THE BEST LITTLE GIRL IN EURALIA IT WILL COME THEN AS A SHOCK TO YOU AS IT DID TO ME ON THE MORNING AFTER I HAD STAGGERED HOME WITH ROGER'S SEVENTEEN VOLUMES
CORONEL DECIDED THAT IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR TACT AH HERE YOU ARE HE SAID CHEERFULLY SHALL WE GET ALONG DON'T BE A FOOL CORONEL SAID UDO ALMOST CRYING
SLIGHTLY REFRESHED AND DECIDED TO TAKE A FIRM LINE WITH THE COUNTESS AT ONCE HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT FINDING HIS WAY DOWN TO HER THE PALACE SEEMED TO BE FULL OF SERVANTS
WELL THINK OF THAT UDO SHOWED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF IT BY WAVING IT PEEVISHLY THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR TACT HE SAID TELL ME WHAT I LOOK LIKE CORONEL CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT HE WAS SAVE THAT THERE WAS AN IMPRESSION OF MAGNIFICENCE ABOUT HIS PERSON SUCH MAGNIFICENCE ANYHOW AS IS GIVEN BY AN ASTRAKHAN TRIMMED FUR COAT
THERE'S NO HOLDING UDO ONCE HE BEGINS VOLUNTEERED CORONEL HE'S THE MOST DESPERATE LOVER IN ARABY MY FATHER WILL BE SO EXCITED WHEN HE HEARS SAID HYACINTH
YOU ARE MY PRINCE SAID HYACINTH PROUDLY MY DEAR I AM A KING AMONG MEN TO DAY AND YOU ARE MY QUEEN BUT THAT'S IN OUR OWN SPECIAL COUNTRY OF TWO IF YOU ARE SO PARTICULAR SAID HYACINTH WITH A SMILE
I SHOULD NOT RECORD IT OF HER WERE NOT ROGER SO INSISTENT NOW
A CONTEMPORARY POET OF THE COUNTRY KING MERRIWIG THE FIRST RODE BACK FROM WAR AS MANY OTHER KINGS HAD DONE BEFORE FIVE HUNDRED MEN BEHIND HIM WERE IN SIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT LEFT RIGHT
SHE TOOK UNFLINCHING WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST SHOCK IN HER LIFE THEN PERHAPS I HAD BETTER SEE THAT EVERYTHING IS READY IN THE PALACE SHE SAID IF YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL EXCUSE ME
THE COUNTESS AND I WERE JUST HAVING A LITTLE I WAS JUST TELLING HER WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT HOW DID YOU GET HERE CORONEL SHALL WE TELL HIM SAID CORONEL WITH A SMILE AT HYACINTH HYACINTH NODDED
SO POPULAR TO ARABY WHERE HE RODE DAILY AMONG HIS FATHER'S SUBJECTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CHEERING HIM HOW AWKWARD FOR EVERYBODY ON TO EURALIA THEN
WITH KING MERRIWIG'S PERMISSION HE WAS SETTLING IN BARODIA AND WITH THE CHIEF ARMOURER'S PERMISSION HE WAS STARTING ON HIS NEW LIFE AS A MARRIED MAN AS THE TOWERS OF THE CASTLE CAME IN SIGHT MERRIWIG DREW A DEEP BREATH OF HAPPINESS HOME AGAIN
BUT SUDDENLY SHE REMEMBERED
AND LOLLOPED SADLY OFF IT WAS HIS ONE REALLY DIGNIFIED MOMENT IN EURALIA ON HIS WAY TO HIS APARTMENT
HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AT THE EXPRESSION ON BELVANE'S FACE SHE WAS LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER AT SOMETHING BEHIND HIM WHY WHOEVER IS THIS SHE SAID GETTING TO HER FEET BEFORE UDO HAD COMPLETELY CLEARED HIS MIND OF HIS DRAGON
THOUGH HE WAS BEGINNING TO GUESS THAT NOBLE HANDSOME COUNTENANCE WHICH IS SO JUSTLY THE PRIDE OF ARABY
UDO DROPPED UNDECIDEDLY INTO A SEAT THIS WANTED THINKING OUT THE COUNTESS WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER AFTER ALL AND SHE EVIDENTLY ADORED HIM OF COURSE THAT WAS NOT SURPRISING THE QUESTION WAS
THERE WERE ANY ADVENTURES IN EURALIA FOR A HUMBLE FELLOW LIKE HIMSELF CORONEL SAID A SMALL VOICE BEHIND HIM HE TURNED ROUND INDIFFERENTLY
YES I THINK YOU MAY TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT THAT IT'S TRUE I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION WHAT DO YOU KEEP CLINGING TO MY ARM LIKE THIS FOR
NO MATTER DEAR WE CAN EASILY FIND YOU PLENTY MORE SUITORS INDEED THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN VERY NEAR MY THOUGHTS LATELY WE'LL ARRANGE A LITTLE COMPETITION AND LET THEM KNOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES THERE'LL BE NO LACK OF CANDIDATES
HE PATTED HER AGAIN AS THOUGH IT WERE SHE AND NOT HIMSELF WHO WAS IN DANGER OF BREAKING DOWN MY LITTLE HYACINTH MY OWN LITTLE GIRL OH FATHER I AM GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK THERE THERE MY CHILD
HE WAVED AN EXPLANATORY PAW EVEN IN THE MOST HIDEOUS OF BEASTS THERE MIGHT BE A DIGNITY HE MEDITATED FOR A MOMENT HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A YAK CORONEL HE ASKED NEVER
BUT FOR THE MOMENT I CANNOT SEE BEYOND THE SADNESS OF IT THAT TO A PRINCE OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF ARABY
MORE THAN ADVISER SHE GUESSED TO HYACINTH HER OWN POSITION WOULD NOT BE IN MUCH DOUBT AND AS FOR THE KING IT MIGHT BE MONTHS BEFORE HE CAME BACK AND WHEN HE DID COME WOULD HE REMEMBER HER
I CAN'T PLANT THEM IN THE GARDEN I THOUGHT WE MIGHT RUN THEM UP THE FLAGSTAFF AS WE DID IN BARODIA ISN'T THAT A LITTLE UNKIND NOW THAT THE POOR MAN'S DEAD MERRIWIG LOOKED ROUND HIM TO SEE THAT THERE WERE NO EAVESDROPPERS
REALLY I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS BECAUSE I'M TOO UNIMPORTANT YES THAT MUST BE IT HE BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE BRIGHTER OBVIOUSLY THAT'S IT HE CARESSED A WHISKER WITH ONE OF HIS PAWS
WE AGREE I MEAN WIGGS
YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOUR PRECIOUS COUNTESS WHOM YOU EXPECT ME TO MARRY HOW VERY UNKIND OF HER A NASTY PERSON TO ANNOY HE WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED THOUGHTFULLY
BE VERY CLOSE CORONEL SHE WHISPERED AND THEN THEY WALKED OUT TOGETHER IF ANY OF THE SERVANTS AT THE PALACE WERE SURPRISED TO SEE CORONEL THEY DID NOT SHOW IT AFTER ALL THAT WAS THEIR BUSINESS
I THINK I'M COMING OUT WONDERING WHAT IT ALL MEANT CORONEL WAITED IN SILENCE YES I AM COMING OUT CORONEL SAID THE VOICE BUT YOU MUSTN'T BE SURPRISED IF I DON'T LOOK VERY WELL
PROTESTED UDO INDIGNANTLY
THE COUNTESS LOOKED AT HIM CRITICALLY WITH HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE NO SHE SAID THAT'S QUITE WRONG NATURALLY I'M A LITTLE OUT OF PRACTICE
CORONEL SHOOK HIM SOLEMNLY BY THE HAND I CONGRATULATE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS I WILL ANNOUNCE YOUR DECISION TO THE PRINCESS SHE WILL BE MUCH AMU MUCH DELIGHTED AND HE TURNED INTO THE PALACE
THE CONTRAST WAS TOO STRIKING BUT HE ALONE HYACINTH'S ONLY HELP SURELY SHE WOULD APPRECIATE HIS MAGNANIMITY ALSO AS HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF A MOMENT AGO
AND I WOULD NOT HAVE YOU MISUNDERSTAND ANY OF THEM BUT WITH REGARD TO ONE OF THEM THERE IS NO NEED FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING IN HER DEFENCE ABOUT HER AT ANY RATE
UDO EVIDENTLY HADN'T THOUGHT OF THIS HE TRIED TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST FRIGHTENED SHE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING
WE CAN TALK QUITE WELL LIKE THIS I AM SORRY UDO SAID CORONEL MEEKLY WE SEEM TO HAVE MADE A MISTAKE BUT YOU MUST ADMIT WE FOUND YOU IN A VERY COMPROMISING POSITION IT WASN'T IN THE LEAST COMPROMISING
UNTAMABLE IN THE MAN THEY LOVE WELL THERE IT WAS IT WAS NOT AS IF HE HAD CORONEL WITH HIM CORONEL AND HE IN HIS PRESENT HEALTH COULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO EURALIA TOGETHER
YOU KNOW OF COURSE THAT HIS MAJESTY COMES BACK TO MORROW WITH ALL HIS ARMY SHE DID NOT SWOON OR UTTER A CRY SHE DID NOT PLEAD THE VAPOURS OR THE MEGRIMS
HE SAID ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE STARTING WE AREN'T STARTING SAID THE VOICE WHAT'S THE MATTER WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THE BUSHES FOR WHATEVER'S THE MATTER UDO
SO THEY HELD A COUNCIL OF WAR PRINCE UDO PUT FORWARD TWO SUGGESTIONS THE FIRST WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK ON THE MORROW AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN THE SECOND
SO FAR AS IS KNOWN THIS WAS HER ONLY WORK BUT SHE BUILT UP SOME REPUTATION ON IT AND BELVANE WHO WAS A GOOD JUDGE HAD A HIGH OPINION OF HER GENIUS TO BE EXACT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE MEN
RABBIT HE SOBBED SO UNDIGNIFIED
HE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND BEGAN TO THINK IT OUT LEFT TO HIMSELF UDO VERY SOON MADE UP HIS MIND THERE WERE THREE COURSES OPEN TO HIM HE MIGHT STAY WHERE HE WAS TILL HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
MAY I CONGRATULATE YOUR MAJESTY ON YOUR WONDERFUL VICTORY OVER THE BARODIANS FROM THE LITTLE I HAVE GATHERED OUTSIDE IT IS THE MOST REMARKABLE VICTORY THAT HAS EVER OCCURRED BUT OF COURSE I AM LONGING TO HEAR THE FULL STORY FROM YOUR MAJESTY'S OWN LIPS
PERHAPS YOUR PRINCE UDO WOULD CARE TO BE A COMPETITOR TOO HYACINTH AND CORONEL INTERCHANGED A SMILE ALAS FATHER SHE SAID HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS IS NOT ATTRACTED BY MY POOR CHARMS
THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE WORD ABOUT IT MENTIONED UNTIL YOU PUSHED YOUR WAY IN JUST NOW
BUT WE SHALL NEVER KNOW ABOUT THE BUTTERFLY IT MAY BE THAT WIGGS HAS LOST US HERE A THOUGHT ON LEPIDOPTERA WHICH THE WORLD CAN ILL SPARE FOR SHE INTERRUPTED BREATHLESSLY
I SAW ONE ONCE IN BARODIA IT IS NOT A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL CORONEL BUT AS A YAK I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNLOVABLE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH AT A YAK CORONEL
TO MELANCHOLY OF COURSE WIGGS CAUGHT IT IN THE MORNING THE COUNTESS SUSPECTED WHAT SHE COULD NOT PROVE WIGGS NOW
SAID UDO NERVOUSLY THEN FRANKLY YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS LOOKS FUNNY VERY FUNNY SAID UDO WISTFULLY VERY FUNNY SAID CORONEL HIS HIGHNESS SIGHED
HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY
UDO IS ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS HE TURNED AND CLAPPED THAT BEWILDERED HIGHNESS ON THE BACK AREN'T YOU UDO AND I CAN THINK OF NO ONE MORE SUITABLE IN EVERY WAY HE BOWED AGAIN AND TURNED BACK TO THE PRINCE WELL UDO YOU'RE LOOKING SPLENDID
IT'S RATHER SERIOUS BUT IT'S RATHER NICE FATHER DEAR WOULD YOU MIND VERY MUCH IF I GOT MARRIED SOON MY DEAR YOU SHALL GET MARRIED AS SOON AS YOU LIKE LET ME SEE THERE WERE SIX OR SEVEN PRINCES WHO CAME ABOUT IT ONLY THE OTHER DAY
BUT SHE WAS STILL ENGROSSED WITH THE WHISKERS
I'M I'M CORONEL HERE I AM SAID UDO PATHETICALLY
PERSONALLY I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT SHE SEES IN YOU WHAT IS IT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUS SAID UDO WITH DIGNITY WELL CORONEL I THINK PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT AND THAT IT'S MY DUTY TO MARRY HER
FATHER SHE SAID STROKING HIS HAND WHERE IT RESTED ON HIS KNEE I HAVE GOT SOME NEWS FOR YOU NOTHING ABOUT THE COUN NOTHING SERIOUS I HOPE SAID MERRIWIG IN ALARM
I'M SORRY SAID BELVANE I'M AFRAID I CAN'T PASS YOU
THERE WAS ANOTHER STORM OF CHEERS THE BATTLE CRY OF EURALIA HO HO MERRIWIG WAS SHOUTED FROM FIVE HUNDRED THROATS AND THE MEN DISPERSED HAPPILY TO THEIR HOMES HYACINTH AND MERRIWIG WENT INTO THE PALACE
THIS HE REJECTED AT ONCE WHEN YOU HAVE THE HEAD OF A RABBIT THE TAIL OF A LION AND THE MIDDLE OF A WOOLLY LAMB THE NEED FOR ACTION OF SOME KIND IS IMPERATIVE
NOW WE'VE GOT IT
SO YOU LIKE IT SAID MERRIWIG TRYING TO LOOK MODEST I LOVE IT I KNEW HE'D LOVE IT PUT IN HYACINTH IT'S JUST THE SORT OF STORY THAT CORONEL WOULD LOVE
WAS LED INTO BELVANE'S GARDEN SHE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE FLAGGED WALK BETWEEN HER LAVENDER HEDGES AND AS HE CAME IN SHE STOPPED
I SENT THEM OFF ON ADVENTURES OF SOME KIND BUT DEAR ME YES THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN BACK BY NOW I SUPPOSE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING OF THEM NO FATHER SAID HYACINTH WITH A LITTLE SMILE AH WELL NO DOUBT THEY WERE UNSUCCESSFUL
AND HE WAS TELLING ONCE MORE THE GREAT STORY OF HIS ADVENTURES WELL WELL SAID THE KING AT THE END OF IT WHEN HE HAD RECEIVED THEIR TRIBUTE OF ADMIRATION THOSE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE LITTLE ADVENTURES THAT HAPPEN IN WAR TIME HE TURNED TO CORONEL
YES BUT OF COURSE THE CHANCE MIGHT COME AGAIN YOU'D HAVE THE THING HANGING OVER YOU ALWAYS SHE'S CLEVER YOU KNOW AND I SHOULD NEVER FEEL QUITE SAFE IF SHE WERE MY ENEMY LOVELY FLOWERS AREN'T THEY WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS ONE
WE WILL BE HER MOST HUMBLE OBEDIENT SERVANTS SHE SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING SHE WANTS INCLUDING PRINCE UDO SMILED HYACINTH THAT'S A SPLENDID IDEA WE'LL MAKE HER HAVE UDO
MY WALKS ABOUT I LIKE TO SEE THE ROSES OUT I LIKE THEM YELLOW WHITE AND PINK BUT CRIMSON ARE THE BEST I THINK
HE ASKED I DON'T MIND WHAT YOU ARE BUT YOU'LL NEVER DARE SHOW YOURSELF IN THE COUNTRY LIKE THIS BE CAREFUL WOMAN DON'T DRIVE ME TOO FAR
NO IT'S NOT THE PRINCESS ELVIRA SAID HYACINTH A LITTLE NERVOUSLY THE KING LAUGHED GOOD HUMOUREDLY AH WELL YOU MUST TELL ME HE SAID
HANDICAP AGAIN I DON'T SEE ANYTHING TO LAUGH AT HE SAID STIFFLY TO INTELLIGENT PEOPLE THE OUTSIDE APPEARANCE IS NOT EVERYTHING
SHE HAD LENT THE RING TO NOBODY TRUE
THIS IS NOT A MORAL WORK AN HOUR LATER WIGGS CAME INTO BELVANE'S GARDEN EAGER TO DISCOVER IN WHAT WAY HER INABILITY TO RHYME WOULD MANIFEST ITSELF
BUT DIFFICULT TO BE EFFECTIVE PARTICULARLY WHEN
THE PRINCESS AND CORONEL WERE UPON THEM AH COUNTESS I THOUGHT WE SHOULD FIND YOU TOGETHER SAID HYACINTH ARCHLY LET ME PRESENT TO YOU MY FRIEND THE DUKE CORONEL
AND WHO MIGHT CORONEL BE SAID THE KING RATHER STERNLY HE'S HE'S WELL HE'S HERE HE IS FATHER SHE RAN UP TO HIM IMPULSIVELY AS HE CAME IN AT THE DOOR
MEANWHILE UDO OF COURSE BLUNDERED ALONG GAILY WE AREN'T EXACTLY PRINCESS I MEAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE CORONEL I DIDN'T KNOW PRINCESS THAT YOU
BY THE WAY WHO IS HE HE COMES FROM ARABY AND HIS NAME IS UDO OF COURSE WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF HIM AN EXCELLENT ARRANGEMENT MY DEAR IT ISN'T UDO I'M AFRAID FATHER IT'S CORONEL
AND ROGER SCURVILEGS WHO TAKE THESE NARROW MATTER OF FACT VIEWS ONE MERELY WASTES TIME IN ARGUING WITH THEM MY PLANS SHE REPEATED
TO HYACINTH HE SEEMED THE DEAREST OF FATHERS AND THE MOST WONDERFUL OF KINGS AND BY AND BY THE MOMENT CAME OF WHICH CORONEL HAD SPOKEN AND NOW SAID MERRIWIG
I'M NOT EVEN A RABBIT
BUT I THINK I HAVE NOTHING IN MY GARDEN AT THIS MOMENT
BY THE WAY HE ADDED HENRY IS MARRYING AND SETTLING DOWN IN BARODIA IT IS CURIOUS HE WENT ON HOW AFTER A WAR ONE'S THOUGHTS TURN TO MATRIMONY HE GLANCED AT HIS DAUGHTER TO SEE HOW SHE WOULD TAKE THIS
HOWEVER WE'LL SOON GET HIM ALL RIGHT THAT EVENING HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE COTTAGE HAD STOOD BUT IT WAS GONE NEXT MORNING HE RODE BACK TO THE WOOD UDO WAS GONE TOO
NEATLY TIED UP WITH BLUE RIBBON FATHER HE PICKED OUT THE LEFT ONE FONS ET ORIGO IF HE HAD KNOWN ANY LATIN OF THE WAR AND HELD IT UP FOR HYACINTH'S INSPECTION THERE YOU CAN SEE THE PLACE WHERE HENRY SMALLNOSE'S ARROW BENT IT
HE WAS NOT THINKING OF UDO HE WAS WONDERING IF PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD AN ATTENDANT OF SURPASSING BEAUTY OR A DRAGON OF SURPASSING MALEVOLENCE IF IN FACT
HEROICALLY THIS WAS MORE SERIOUS HER DEAR GARDEN IN WHICH SHE COMPOSED RUINED BY THE MASTICATIONS MACHINATIONS WHAT WAS THE WORD
IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW BUT ALL OUR LIFE TOGETHER HAS BEEN IN THE FOREST AND I'M JUST A LITTLE AFRAID OF THE WORLD
IS IT A FACT THAT YOUR MAJESTY MADE HIS WAY AT DEAD OF NIGHT TO THE KING OF BARODIA'S OWN TENT AND CHALLENGED HIM TO MORTAL COMBAT AND SLEW HIM THERE WAS AN EAGERNESS VERY WINNING IN HIS EYES AS HE ASKED IT
TO WHICH THE RING ENTITLED HER SHE DREW THE RING OUT FROM ITS HIDING PLACE ROUND HER NECK I WISH SHE SAID HOLDING IT UP I WISH THAT THE COUNTESS BELVANE SHE STOPPED
WERE IN HIS POCKET DAYS OF HONOURED LEISURE WERE WAITING FOR HIM HE GAZED AT EACH REMEMBERED LANDMARK OF HIS OWN BELOVED COUNTRY HIS HEART OVERFLOWING WITH THANKFULNESS NEVER AGAIN WOULD HE LEAVE EURALIA HOW GOOD TO SEE HYACINTH AGAIN
THAT IT WAS TRULY A MAGIC RING AS THE FAIRY HAD TOLD HER SHE HAD NO DOUBT THAT HER WISH WAS A BAD ONE THAT SHE HAD BEEN BAD ENOUGH TO EARN IT SHE WAS
I WAS AFRAID SO HE SAID THAT'S THE CRUEL PART ABOUT IT HAD I BEEN A LION THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CERTAIN PATHETIC SPLENDOUR ABOUT MY POSITION ISOLATED CUT OFF SUFFERING IN REGAL SILENCE
HE SAID IS THE TALK OF ARABY NATURALLY I HAD TO COME HERE TO SEE FOR MYSELF WHAT SHE WAS LIKE MY DEAR UDO SHE'S CHARMING I CONGRATULATE YOU DON'T BE A FOOL CORONEL I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST INTENTION OF MARRYING HER
GOOD BYE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
TELL HIM ABOUT HOW YOU FOUGHT THE KING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR AND HOW YOU PRETENDED TO BE A SWINEHERD AND HOW COULD ANY FATHER HAVE RESISTED IN A LITTLE WHILE HYACINTH AND CORONEL WERE SEATED EAGERLY AT HIS FEET
AND HE SAW AT ONCE THAT HE KNEW A GOOD STORY WHEN HE HEARD ONE OF COURSE HE SAID YOU'LL HAVE TO WIN HER ANYTHING YOUR MAJESTY SETS ME TO DO IT'S AS WELL HE ADDED WITH A DISARMING SMILE
OF OUR MOTHERS AND WIVES AND DAUGHTERS PROLONGED CHEERING AS THE CASE MAY BE HEAR HEAR
DID WHAT TURNED ME INTO A A A RABBIT SAID BELVANE INNOCENTLY
THAT IS WHY BELVANE LAUGHED AGAIN
IN HONOUR OF OUR GREAT VICTORY I DECREE THAT FROM NOW ONWARDS TO MORROW SHALL BE OBSERVED AS A HOLIDAY THROUGHOUT EURALIA TERRIFIC CHEERING
IT WAS LIKELY THAT SHE ALONE COULD TURN HIM BACK AGAIN AND THAT IN THAT CASE HE HAD BETTER ONLY THREATEN HER I WANT SOMEBODY KILLED SAID UDO RATHER NATURALLY SUPPOSE SAID CORONEL
HE SEEMED TO BE ENVYING THE KING SUCH AN ADVENTURE AN ADVENTURE AFTER HIS OWN HEART MERRIWIG WAS IN AN AWKWARD POSITION HE WONDERED FOR A MOMENT WHETHER TO ORDER HIS DAUGHTER OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVE US MY CHILD
AH WHAT A MIRACLE WORKER TRUE LOVE IS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH MADE BELVANE SO REMARKABLE WAS THAT SHE WAS NEVER AFRAID OF REMAINING SILENT WHEN SHE WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO SAY
HE MIGHT GO BACK TO ARABY
BEWARE LEST YOU ROUSE THE LION IN ME WHERE ASKED BELVANE WITH A CHILD LIKE AIR
WHAT IS HIS INCOME A MAN MUST PROVE HIS WORTH IN SOME WAY I HAVEN'T SENT HIM AWAY AT ALL YET SHE SAID HE'S ONLY JUST COME HE'S BEEN VERY KIND TO ME AND I'M SURE YOU'LL LOVE HIM WELL WELL WE'LL ARRANGE SOMETHING FOR HIM
AN APPLE PIE BED FOR THE COUNTESS IT WAS THE MOST PERFECT APPLE PIE BED EVER MADE COX HIMSELF COULD NOT HAVE IMPROVED UPON IT
BUT NO DOUBT HE WOULD THINK OF SOME TREMENDOUSLY CUNNING DEVICE LATER ON TO EURALIA THEN WITH ALL DISPATCH HE TROTTED OFF
I MUST ASK YOU NOT TO REFER TO IT IF I MARRY THE COUNTESS YOU'LL BE A VERY LUCKY MAN PUT IN CORONEL I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT THE KING OF EURALIA HOWEVER SHE'S CHOSEN YOU IT SEEMS
REALISED THAT IT WAS HER TURN AGAIN WHAT SHOULD SHE DO AN INSPIRATION CAME TO HER SHE HAD BEEN REALLY BAD THE DAY BEFORE IT WAS A PITY TO WASTE SUCH PERFECT BADNESS AS THAT
SAID MERRIWIG HEARTILY WE SHAN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE IN THAT DIRECTION AGAIN I FANCY DO TELL ME DID THE KING OF BARODIA APOLOGISE HE DID BETTER THAN THAT HE ABDICATED WHY
I WAS VERY POLITE TO HER DON'T YOU REMEMBER MY SAYING TO YOU BE POLITE TO HER BECAUSE SHE'S PROBABLY A FAIRY
YOU WILL LEAVE ME LIKE THIS ONE'S ACTIONS ARE VERY MUCH MISUNDERSTOOD SIGHED BELVANE I'VE NO DOUBT THAT THAT IS HOW IT WILL APPEAR
SHE TALKED PLEASANTLY AS SHE WORKED AT IT EVERY LITTLE ACCIDENT TEACHES US SOMETHING NOW IF YOU'D BEEN A RABBIT THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED NO
THAN A REMEMBRANCE OF UDO'S APPEARANCE STARTED HIM OFF AGAIN I COULDN'T HAVE STAYED WITH HIM A MOMENT LONGER HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BURST
HERE HE TURNED AND EMBRACED HIS DAUGHTER AGAIN AND IF HIS EYE TRAVELLED OVER HER SHOULDER IN THE DIRECTION OF BELVANE'S GARDEN IT IS A SMALL MATTER AND ONE FOR WHICH THE ARCHITECT OF THE CASTLE NO DOUBT WAS PRINCIPALLY TO BLAME
I'M JUST KEEPING IT BACK THAT'S ALL
CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET HE ASKED MYSTERIOUSLY OF COURSE SAID HYACINTH DECIDING AT ONCE THAT IT WOULD NOT MATTER IF SHE ONLY TOLD CORONEL WELL THEN LISTEN
THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME HE BEGAN TO LOOK SO MUCH HAPPIER THAT CORONEL THOUGHT IT WAS A FAVOURABLE MOMENT IN WHICH TO WITHDRAW SHALL I GO NOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
AND SO YOU I UNDERSTAND WISH TO MARRY MY DAUGHTER DOES THAT SURPRISE YOUR MAJESTY WELL NO IT DOESN'T AND SHE I UNDERSTAND WISHES TO MARRY YOU YES PLEASE FATHER
WHO HAS SKILFULLY EXTRACTED AN ADMISSION FROM A RELUCTANT WITNESS THIS SORT OF TONE GOES BEST WITH ONE OF THOSE KEEN LEGAL FACES PERHAPS
ON THE SUGGESTION OF BELVANE ONE WET AFTERNOON BUT FOR THE MOMENT THE COUNTESS WAS IN THE WAY
MY DEAR THIS IS INDEED NEWS TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT UPON WHAT QUEST DID YOU SEND HIM HYACINTH HAD FELT THIS COMING
HE FORGOT HIS MANNERS AND MADE A JUMP TOWARDS HER SHE GLIDED GRACEFULLY BEHIND THE SUNDIAL IN A PRETTY AFFECTATION OF ALARM AND THE NEXT MOMENT
BUT IT CAN BE VERY FUNNY CAN'T IT SAID BELVANE COAXINGLY I WISHED FOR SOMETHING HUMOROUS TO HAPPEN TO YOU
BUT HIS WIFE WAS NOT SO MINDED AND THAT ENDED IT BUT IT ROLLED A GREAT BURDEN FROM HIS SHOULDERS TO FEEL THAT HE MIGHT LEAVE THEM IN SUCH CAPABLE HANDS THEY HAD A ROLLICKING TIME AT BREAKFAST FOR GUARDY LUD WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE CRISP BROWN SAUSAGES
NO I WON'T TAKE ANY OF THOSE BOOKS THEY'LL NEED TO BE DUSTED AND PUT IN BOXES THERE ARE A LOT OF BOXES IN THE CELLAR AND THERE'S A PILE OF PAPERS TO USE FOR LINING THE BOXES
I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO CHANCE OF YOUR GETTING SICK OF IT ALL AND COMING BACK AND I MUST SAY I DON'T BLAME YOU IT CERTAINLY IS A CONTRAST FROM THE WAY YOU'VE LIVED UP TO NOW BUT THESE CHILDREN WILL GROW UP AND GET MARRIED AND THEN WHERE WILL YOU BE
GAZING DISAPPROVINGLY AT THE MANY WINDOWS AND THE BRICK TERRACE I SHOULD THINK TWOULD TAKE ALL YOUR TIME TO KEEP CLEAN WHAT'S THE IDEA IN MAKING A SIDEWALK OF YOUR FRONT PORCH LOOKS AS IF SOME CRAZY PERSON HAD BUILT IT COULDN'T YOU FIND ANYTHING BETTER THAN THIS IN THE TOWN
OH BUT MY DEAR YOU MUSTN'T ORDER ALL THAT A SANDWICH IS ALL I NEED JUST A TONGUE SANDWICH YOU MUST NOT BEGIN BY BEING EXTRAVAGANT THIS IS MY PARTY CLOUDY THIS GOES UNDER THE HEAD OF EXPENSES IF YOU CAN'T FIND ENOUGH YOU LIKE AMONG WHAT I ORDER
UNTIL YOU CAME TO YEARS AND COULD FINISH THE BOND BY GIVING YOURSELF TO THE LORD I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE SWEET SERIOUS LOOK ON THE FACE OF YOUR LOVELY GIRL MOTHER WHEN SHE BOWED HER HEAD IN ANSWER TO THE MINISTER'S QUESTION DO YOU THUS PROMISE
YES SAID THEIR AUNT WITH AN AFFECTIONATE HOMAGE IN HER EYES FOR THIS DEAR CAPABLE BOY WHO WAS SO EAGER OVER EVERYTHING AS IF IT WERE HIS OWN
THINK AGAIN WHY I'M NOT EVEN WHAT YOU'D CALL A CHRISTIAN HE SURELY WOULDN'T CALL PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T WELL WHAT YOU'D CALL ENLISTED WITH HIM WOULD HE HE MIGHT ANSWERED JULIA CLOUD REFLECTIVELY SHE WAS SITTING ON THE END OF THE BIG BLUE COUCH
WITH A FOUNTAIN PLAYING NEARBY OVER FERNS AND IVY CLIMBING OVER A MIMIC PERGOLA
BUT TOWARD THE END OF THEIR TRIP THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO GET RESTLESS FOR THE LITTLE PINK AND WHITE COTTAGE AND HOME WE REALLY OUGHT TO GET BACK AND SEE HOW THE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR SOCIETY IS GETTING ALONG SAID ALLISON ONE DAY AS THEY GLIDED THROUGH A LITTLE VILLAGE THAT REMINDED THEM OF HOME
I SUPPOSE SHE WOULD RESPONDED THE PRESIDENT HESITATINGLY LOOKING TOWARD THE TWO LADIES OF THE COMMITTEE WITH A HALF APOLOGY WHAT DO YOU GIRLS THINK ABOUT IT OH I SUPPOSE SHE COULD PRAY SAID THE GIRL CALLED MAME WITH A SHRUG SHE DOES YOU KNOW OFTEN IN MEETING
WELL I DO SOMETIMES WHEN THERE'S NO ONE ELSE BUT IT COMES HARD AND THERE'S OLD MISS FERBY BUT SHE ALWAYS PRAYS SO LONG AND GETS IN THE PRESIDENT AND ALL THE MISSIONARY STATIONS I SHOULD THINK YOU'D ASK THAT JANE BRISTOL SPOKE UP LESLIE EARNESTLY I KNOW SHE MUST BE ABLE TO SHE TALKED THAT WAY
AND TOLD THEM TO GO AND DO SOMETHING FOR HIM THERE WAS PAUL HE WAS ACTUALLY AGAINST HIM AND THERE WAS ABRAHAM HE LIVED AMONG REGULAR IDOL WORSHIPPERS AND GOD CALLED HIM TO GO INTO A STRANGE LAND AND FOUNDED A NEW FAMILY FOR HIM THE BEGINNING OF THE PECULIAR PEOPLE
I LOVE IT I HOVERED AROUND IT AGAIN AND AGAIN BUT I DIDN'T DREAM OF HAVING IT IN MY ROOM IT WAS SO EXPENSIVE IT'S REAL FRENCH ENAMEL YOU KNOW AND HAPPENS TO BE A CRAZE OF FASHION AT PRESENT I THOUGHT IT WAS RIDICULOUS TO BUY IT
WITH A CLOSE GRAY FEATHER CURLED QUIETLY ABOUT IT THAT SETTLED DOWN ON JULIA CLOUD'S LOVELY WHITE HAIR AS IF IT HAD BEEN MADE FOR HER YOU DON'T MIND DO YOU CLOUDY DEAR YOU DON'T THINK I'M OFFICIOUS OR IMPERTINENT BEGGED LESLIE ANXIOUSLY
THE CAR WAS ALREADY AT THE DOOR AND SHE FELT ALMOST GUILTY AS SHE LOCKED THE DOOR AND WENT DOWN THE PATH BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE DAY INTOXICATED HER AT ONCE AND SHE FORGOT IMMEDIATELY EVERYTHING BUT THE JOY OF RIDING OUT INTO THE WORLD
I'M JUST GOING TO BE A SORT OF MOTHER TO THEM AND YOU OUGHTN'T TO CALL THEM SNOBS THEY ARE YOUR OWN BROTHER'S CHILDREN OWN BROTHER'S CHILDREN NOTHING SNEERED ELLEN HE'S BEEN AWAY SO MANY YEARS HE WAS JUST LIKE A STRANGER WHEN HE CAME BACK THE LAST TIME
BUT JULIA CLOUD WAS GENUINELY GLAD TO SEE HER SISTER AND SAID SO HEARTILY ENOUGH TO SATISFY EVEN SO JEALOUS A NATURE AS ELLEN'S AND SO PRESENTLY THEY WERE WALKING ABOUT THE PRETTY ROOMS TOGETHER AND ELLEN WAS TAKING IN ALL THE BEAUTIES OF THE HOME
THE PLEASANT AROMAS OF COFFEE AND SAUSAGES WERE MINGLING IN THE AIR WHEN GUARDY LUD WOKE UP AND LOOKED ABOUT THE OLD FASHIONED ROOM WITH A SENSE OF SATISFACTION THE VERY PICTURES ON THE WALLS RESTED HIM THEY REMINDED HIM SO MUCH OF THE ROOMS IN HIS BOYHOOD HOME
DOESN'T SHE LOOK LOVELY IN IT ALLISON OH ISN'T SHE DEAR AND LESLIE CAUGHT HER AND WHIRLED HER AROUND THE ROOM THEN ALLISON BROUGHT THE BIG SQUARE BOX AND DEMANDED THAT IT BE OPENED AND OUT OF IT CAME A SMALL GRAY HAT IN SOFT SILKY BEAVER
AND TO PRESIDE OVER THEIR HOME THAT'S RIDICULOUS PUT IN ELLEN WHY DON'T THEY GO TO COLLEGE AND BOARD LIKE ANY OTHER REASONABLE YOUNG FOLKS IF THEY MUST GO TO COLLEGE AT ALL I THINK IT'S ALL NONSENSE FOR EM TO GO WHAT DO THEY DO IT FOR THEY'VE GOT MONEY
AND A GLANCE AT THE KIND STRONG FACE OF THE WHITE HAIRED MAN GAVE HER COURAGE ELLEN COULD NOT REALLY SPOIL THEIR PLANS WITH HIM THERE HE FELT THAT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS GOOD AND WITH HIM TO BACK HER SHE FELT SHE COULD STAND OUT AGAINST ANY ARGUMENTS HER SISTER MIGHT BRING FORTH
THEN IN THE MORNING WE CAN GET UP EARLY HAVE OUR BREAKFAST AND DRIVE BACK HERE IN TIME BEFORE THE MEN COME NOW ISN'T THAT PERFECTLY SPICK AND SPAN FOR A PLAN LESLIE BUT DEAR THAT WOULD COST A LOT AND BESIDES IT ISN'T IN THE LEAST NECESSARY
WHY THE VERY IDEA SAID LESLIE WITH SNAPPING EYES AS IF WE WANTED A MAN ALWAYS AROUND NO INDEED HORRORS WOULDN'T THAT BE AWFUL BUT PROFESSOR ARMITAGE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WHO CAME ONCE TO CLOUDY VILLA LIKED IT
ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL COMFORT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT ABOUT OF COURSE BUT THIS BELONGS ENTIRELY TO THAT LITTLE OLD RATTY CHURCH AND I HAVEN'T ANYTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH IT AND I WANT YOU TO FORGET IT CLOUDY FOR I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT
MORE THAN I EVER EXPECTED TO HAVE ALL TOGETHER IN LIFE AND I SHALL NOT TROUBLE ANYBODY FOR SUPPORT HOWEVER I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO WORK FOR A GOOD MANY YEARS YET AND WHAT I'M DOING NOW I LOVE SHALL WE GO DOWN STAIRS
I'M AFRAID WE SHALL HAVE TO GET SOME THINGS OUT AGAIN I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN GET ALONG NOT A BIT OF IT CLOUDY SAID LESLIE GIVING A SPRING AND PERCHING HERSELF ON THE DRAIN BOARD OF THE SINK WHERE SHE SAT SWINGING HER DAINTY LITTLE PUMPS AS NONCHALANTLY AS IF SHE WERE SITTING ON A VELVET SOFA
NO PAPER ON THE WALL THAT'S QUEER ISN'T IT AND THE CHIMNEY RIGHT IN THE ROOM
WELL I WONDER WHAT HER MOTHER WOULD THINK JULIA CLOUD WENT SLOWLY BACK TO THE DINING ROOM WHERE ELLEN WAS SEATED ON THE COUCH WAITING LIKE A VISITOR JULIA'S SMILE WAS UTTERLY LOST ON HER GLUM COUNTENANCE WHICH RESEMBLED AN EMBATTLED TOWER UNDER SIEGE
ALLISON HAD STOPPED IN HIS ANGRY WALK UP AND DOWN THE ROOM AND WAS LOOKING AT HER INTERESTEDLY IS THAT RIGHT CLOUDY WAS I BAPTIZED IN THE OLD STERLING CHURCH I NEVER KNEW THAT TELL ME ABOUT IT AND HE SEATED HIMSELF ON THE OTHER END OF THE COUCH
I'VE A LOT OF SHOPPING TO DO HOW ABOUT YOU CLOUDY I MUST BUY A TRUNK SAID JULIA CLOUD THOUGHTFULLY AND A HAND BAG AND SOME GLOVES I OUGHT TO GET A NEW WARM COAT BUT THAT WILL DO LATER
I DON'T MEAN ANY DISRESPECT TO GRANDMOTHER BUT OH YOU WOULD LOOK SO SWEET IN GRAY GRAY AND LAVENDER AND SOFT PINK OR JUST GRAY NOW FOR A WHILE ARE YOU VERY MAD AT ME FOR SAYING IT JULIA CLOUD REACHED OVER AND PATTED THE YOUNG HAND THAT LAY NEAR HER ON THE SEAT
BUT LESLIE INSISTED THAT IT WAS THE ONLY THING FOR MY ROOM AND THOSE CRAZY EXTRAVAGANT CHILDREN WENT AND BOUGHT IT WHEN I HAD MY HEAD TURNED YOU DON'T SAY SAID ELLEN ROBINSON PUTTING A HARD INVESTIGATING FINGER ON THE FOOT BOARD WELL IT DOES SEEM SORT OF SMOOTH
AND AS FOR THE CHILDREN THEY ARE JUST LIKE HIS STUCK UP WIFE AND HER FAMILY YET YOU'LL LEAVE THE CHILDREN THAT WERE BORN AND RAISED CLOSE BESIDE YOU AND GO AND SLAVE FOR THEM MOTHER FIDDLESTICKS YOU'LL SLAVE ALL RIGHT I KNOW YOU
AND HER TONE GREW GENTLER THAT'S DEAR OF YOU ELLEN AND I APPRECIATE IT BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND YET I SEE I'M NOT TO BE A WORKER NOR EVEN A HOUSEKEEPER I'M TO BE JUST A SORT OF MOTHER OR AUNT IF YOU PLEASE
AND JUMPED DOWN FROM HER PERCH TO HUG AND SQUEEZE THE BREATH OUT OF JULIA CLOUD BUT CHILD DEAR SAID THAT GOOD WOMAN WHEN SHE COULD GET HER BREATH TO SPEAK YOU MUSTN'T BEGIN IN THAT EXTRAVAGANT WAY
THE ROOMS HAD ASSUMED THAT CLEARED UP READY LOOK THAT RESTS THE TIRED WORKER JUST TO LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHAT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITH A CONVICTION THAT SHE WAS BEING QUITE A CHILD TO RUN AWAY THIS WAY WHEN THERE WAS STILL A LOT TO BE DONE
AND THEY'LL CHOOSE THAT KIND FOR LIFE I'M ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH THE WORK YOU'RE DOING MISS CLOUD I COULDN'T HAVE FOUND A BETTER MOTHER FOR EM IF I'D SEARCHED HEAVEN I'M SURE AND SO JULIA CLOUD WAS WELL CONTENT TO GO ON WITH HER BELOVED WORK AS HOME MAKER
WATCHING JANE BRISTOL'S SWEET SMILE AS SHE TALKED OVER SOME COMMITTEE PLANS WITH ALLISON I SHOULD SAY THEY WERE ABOUT AS WHOLESOME A COUPLE OF YOUNG PEOPLE AS COULD BE FOUND TO MATCH YOUR TWO
YOU MEAN SAID BRYAN DRAWING HIS BROWS TOGETHER IN A COMICAL WAY BEHIND HIS GOGGLES YOU MEAN PRAY I SUPPOSE
THEY BOTH BROKE DOWN AND LAUGHED BUT I'M GLAD THEY CAME CLOUDY I TRULY AM IT WAS NICE TO PLAY WITH THE CHILDREN
NOW THIS WHOLE EVENING'S SPOILED I WISH I HADN'T GONE TO THE FRONT DOOR AT ALL I WISH I'D TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS AND LET EM KNOCK AND THERE WAS THAT STORY YOU WERE GOING TO READ AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE WHY NO IT'S NOT TOO LATE AT ALL SAID JULIA CLOUD CONSULTING HER LITTLE WATCH IN THE FIRELIGHT
AND AS SHE CAUGHT THE GLOW AND GLINT FROM THE WINDOW SHE REMEMBERED THE GRAY EVENING WHEN SHE HAD LOOKED OUT ACROSS INTO HER FUTURE AS SHE SUPPOSED IT WOULD BE HOW BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL THAT THE GRAY HAD CHANGED TO GLOW
SETTLING INTO A BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE BUT I DON'T LIKE THOSE GIRLS ONE BIT AND I DON'T CARE IF THEY STAY IN SEVEN EGYPTS NOW LOOK HERE CLOUDY JEWEL PLEADED ALLISON YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET ME INTO ANY SUCH CORNER AS THAT
WHILE ALLISON WENT AFTER THE CAR TO TAKE HIM TO THE TRAIN IS THAT MAN MARRIED BECAUSE IF HE ISN'T I DON'T THINK IT'S RESPECTABLE FOR YOU TO GO AND LIVE NEAR HIM DECLARED ELLEN IN A PENETRATING VOICE TO THE INTENSE DISTRESS OF JULIA CLOUD WHO WAS HAPPILY HURRYING THE DISHES FROM THE BREAKFAST TABLE
AND HE CAST AN ANXIOUS GLANCE TOWARD THE STAIR DOOR AGAIN JULIA CLOUD SMILED UNDERSTANDINGLY AND USHERED THEM INTO THE LITTLE PARLOR ABLAZE WITH FALL SUNSHINE ITS WINDOWS WREATHED ABOUT WITH CRIMSONING WOODBINE
ALLISON POLITE TO THE LAST CLOSED THE DOOR WITH A COURTEOUS GOOD NIGHT AND THEN STOOD FROWNING AT THE FIRE JULIA CLOUD CAME SOFTLY INTO THE ROOM AND WENT AND STOOD BESIDE HIM WITH LOVING QUESTION IN HER EYES HE MET HER GAZE WITH A NEW KIND OF HARDNESS
THAT THEY WERE TO STAY DOWN UNTIL THE VERY LAST THING AND NOW HE HAS TAKEN THE TABLE EVEN I WENT UP STAIRS TO SEE IF I COULD GET AT THINGS AND I FIND HE HAS PUT THEM AWAY AT THE BACK
FRIED POTATOES AND BUCKWHEATS WITH REAL MAPLE SYRUP AND HE LAUGHED AND ATE AND TOLD STORIES WITH THE CHILDREN AND KEPT THE OLD DINING ROOM WALLS RINGING WITH JOY AS THEY HAD NOT RESOUNDED WITHIN THE MEMORY OF JULIA CLOUD THEN SUDDENLY THE DOOR OPENED
WHAT GOOD DO THEY THINK THEY CAN DO A COUPLE OF SISSIES AND TWO OR THREE KID VAMPS SETTING UP TO LISP RELIGION IT'S RIDICULOUS HE WAS WORKING HIMSELF UP INTO A FINE FRENZY JULIA CLOUD STOOD AND WATCHED HIM AN AMUSED SMILE GROWING ON HER SWEET LIPS
COLLEGE CLOSED LAST WEEK FOR TWO LONG DAYS ALLISON AND LESLIE DEVOTED THEMSELVES RELIGIOUSLY TO THEIR RELATIVES TAKING THEM HERE AND THERE IN THE CAR SHOWING THEM OVER THE COLLEGE AND THE TOWN AND TRYING IN ALL THE WAYS THEY KNEW TO MAKE THEM HAVE A GOOD TIME
WHERE LAY THE PAPER SHE AND MISTER LUDDINGTON HAD JUST SIGNED AND A COPY OF WHICH HE HAD TAKEN WITH HIM SHE RETURNED TO HER ASTONISHED SISTER WITH THE PAPER IN HER HAND PERHAPS IT WOULD BE JUST AS WELL FOR YOU TO READ THIS SHE SAID WITH DIGNITY
SO JULIA CLOUD SETTLED DOWN TO THE PLEASURE OF A NEW AND DELICIOUS COMBINATION OF FOODS AND THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT ALL NOW SAID LESLIE AS THE MEAL DREW TO A CLOSE WE MUST GET TO WORK IT'S HALF PAST TWO AND THE STORES CLOSE AT HALF PAST FIVE
ALLISON STARED AT HIM AND THEN BROKE INTO A LAUGH AGAIN EXACTLY HE CRIED YOU'VE GOT ONTO THE IDEA
SHOWING HIS UNCLE WHERE TO DRIVE IN AND PUT HIS CAR IN THE LITTLE GARAGE HELPING HIS AUNT AND THE LITTLE COUSINS TO ALIGHT FOR MERCY'S SAKE JULIA WHAT A QUEER HOUSE YOU'VE GOT SAID ELLEN THE MINUTE SHE ARRIVED
WHEN LESLIE AND ALLISON BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT PROFESSOR ARMITAGE CAME TO SEE THEIR CLOUDY JEWEL
AND HASTENED TO AFFIRM THAT THEY NEVER FELT THAT WAY ABOUT JANE BRISTOL THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS A REAL GOOD SORT AND HAD ALWAYS MEANT TO GET ACQUAINTED WITH HER ONLY SHE ALWAYS SLIPPED OUT AS SOON AS MEETING WAS OVER
IT'S LIKE CHILD'S PLAY GOING UP I SUPPOSE THAT'S ONE CONSOLATION FOR HAVING SUCH A LITTLE PLAYHOUSE AFFAIR TO LIVE IN YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLIMB UP FAR WELL WE'VE COME TO STAY TWO DAYS IF YOU WANT US HERBERT SAID HE COULD SPARE THAT MUCH TIME OFF
WELL IF YOU FEEL THAT WAY YOU'LL MAKE IT GO I'M SURE ENCOURAGED ALLISON YOU'RE JUST THE KIND OF A FELLOW TO MAKE IT GO YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT NOT I I NEVER HEARD OF THE THING TILL LAST WEEK EXCEPT JUST IN A CASUAL WAY DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT YET
SHE DECLARED AS HER EYES RESTED ON THE LUXURY EVERYWHERE THOUGH I DON'T LIKE THAT PAINTED FURNITURE MUCH MYSELF SHE SAID AS SHE GLANCED AT THE FRENCH GRAY ENAMEL OF THE BED BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL RIGHT IF THAT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU LIKE
BUT I NEVER THOUGHT MY CANE SEAT CHAIRS WERE MUCH GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GET EM OUT AND VARNISH EM WHAT'S THAT OUT THERE A PORCH JULIA CLOUD
WILL YOU COME WHY YES IF ALLISON DOES I WILL AGREED LESLIE DIMPLING THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID BRYAN TURNING BACK TO ALLISON NOW WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU RUSH YOU'LL HAVE TO TEACH US HOW WELL SAID ALLISON THOUGHTFULLY
JULIA CLOUD TOOK THE PEN EAGERLY TREMBLINGLY A SENSE OF WONDER IN HER POUNDING HEART AND SIGNED HER NAME JUST AS ELLEN'S HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COULD BE HEARD POUNDING DOWN THE BACK STAIRS
JULIA CLOUD WAS BENDING OVER THE LONG PASTEBOARD BOX ON THE FLOOR AND FINDING HER NAME ON THAT TOO IT'S VERY STRANGE SHE SAID HER CHEEKS BEGINNING TO GROW PINK LIKE THOSE OF A CHILD ON HER FIRST CHRISTMAS MORNING I SUPPOSE IT'S SOME MORE OF YOUR EXTRAVAGANT CAPERS I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHALL DO WITH YOU
ONLY IT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO LET YOU WORK SO HARD WHEN YOU ARE VISITING ME VISITING NOTHING DECLARED ALLISON WE'RE HAVING THE TIME OF OUR LIVES I HAVEN'T BEEN IN A PLACE WHERE I COULD DO AS I PLEASED SINCE I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD THIS IS REAL WORK AND I LIKE IT COME NOW
BUT I'M AFRAID TO SAY IT MAYBE IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL BAD NOT A BIT DEARY WHAT IS IT WELL THEN CLOUDY DO YOU THINK GRANDMOTHER WOULD CARE VERY MUCH IF YOU DIDN'T WEAR BLACK
WHEN ARE THOSE MEN COMING BACK TO FINISH UP SUDDENLY DEMANDED LESLIE POISING A GLASS OF MILK AND A COOKY IN ONE HAND AND TAKING A GREAT BITE FROM HER APPLE NOT TILL TO MORROW SAID JULIA CLOUD LOOKING AROUND THE EMPTY KITCHEN SPECULATIVELY
SHE KNEW IN HER HEART JUST HOW HERBERT HAD LOOKED WHEN HE HAD SAID THOSE THINGS EVEN TO THE SNARL AT THE CORNER OF HIS NOSE SHE KNEW TOO THAT ELLEN HAD PROBABLY NOT REPORTED THE MESSAGE EVEN SO DISAGREEABLY AS THE ORIGINAL AND SHE KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO FORGET
BECAUSE IT IS YOU WHO MUST ANSWER GOD AND YOU MUST ANSWER HIM FROM THE HEART EITHER WAY SO NOBODY ELSE HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT OH GOOD NIGHT CLOUDY YOU CERTAINLY CAN PUT THINGS IN AN AWKWARD WAY OH HANG IT
DON'T LET'S WASTE ANY TIME WHAT CAN I DO FIRST WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE ME TAKE DOWN ALL THE PICTURES ON THE SECOND FLOOR STACK THEM IN THE ATTIC AND SWEEP DOWN THE WALLS THE WAY WE DID DOWN HERE YESTERDAY
HAVE ALLISON AND LESLIE GOT ANY SWEETHEARTS YET SHE ASKED PRYINGLY AS SHE FOLLOWED HER SISTER DOWN THE STAIRS I SUPPOSE THEY HAVE BY THIS TIME THEY HAVE A GREAT MANY YOUNG FRIENDS AND WE HAVE BEAUTIFUL TIMES TOGETHER BUT YOU WON'T SEE MANY OF THEM NOW
LOVE'S ALL RIGHT SAID THE OLD MAN SMILING BUT THIS THING HAS GOT TO BE ON A BUSINESS BASIS OR THE TERMS OF THE WILL WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO AGREE TO IT YOU SEE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO UNDERTAKE MEANS WORK AND IT MEANS STICKING TO IT
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT WE CAN GIVE IT TO AUNT ELLEN OR SOME ONE JULIA CLOUD'S CHEEKS GREW PINK WITH PLEASURE AND SHE FELT LIKE A VERY YOUNG HAPPY CHILD AS SHE OPENED THE PARCEL TO FIND A LOVELY GRAY SUEDE HAND BAG WITH SILVER CLASP AND FITTINGS CONTAINING QUITE A LITTLE OUTFIT
BESIDES I SUPPOSE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED CRAZY IF I HAD GONE ME AN OLDISH WOMAN IF THERE HAD BEEN CHILDREN TO TAKE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT I SUPPOSE IT IS A CHILDISH DESIRE BUT I ALWAYS LOVED PICTURES
AND WE MUST FINISH UP OUR PLANS FOR THE TRIP AND GET READY TO CLOSE THE HOUSE FOR THE SUMMER THEY HAD A WONDERFUL TRIP TO MOUNTAINS AND LAKES AND SEASIDE STAYING AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED WHEREVER THEY LIKED AND EVERYWHERE MAKING FRIENDS AND HAVING GOOD TIMES
WE APPOINT SOME ONE TO LOOK AFTER HIM SPECIALLY AND A CERTAIN GROUP HAVE HIM IN THEIR CHARGE SO THE OTHER FRATS WON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO RUSH HIM I SEE THE OTHER FRATS BEING REPRESENTED BY THE DEVIL I SUPPOSE SAID THE ROUND EYED BOY KEENLY WITHOUT A SMILE
IT WAS STRANGE HOW GOOD EVEN SHREDDED WHEAT BISCUIT AND MILK CAN TASTE WHEN ONE HAS BEEN WORKING HARD AND HAS A YOUNG APPETITE ALTHOUGH LESLIE AND ALLISON HAD BEEN KNOWN TO SCORN ALL CEREALS STILL THERE WERE COOKIES AND WONDERFUL APPLES FROM THE BIG TREE IN THE BACK YARD FOR DESSERT
AND BESIDES WE'VE GOT SOME OTHER THINGS TO ATTEND TO THEN WE'LL HUSTLE INTO THE CAR AND GET TO TOWN AND DO SOME SHOPPING READY FOR OUR TRIP THAT WILL REST YOU WE'LL GET LUNCH AT A TEA ROOM AND SHOP ALL THE AFTERNOON WE'LL GO TO A HOTEL FOR DINNER AND STAY ALL NIGHT
AND GIVE YOU SUCH A WRONG IMPRESSION YOU KNOW I COULDN'T THINK OF COMING TO LIVE ON YOU AND HERBERT IT WAS KIND OF YOU TO SUGGEST IT AND I AM GRATEFUL AND ALL THAT BUT I KNOW HOW IT WOULD BE TO HAVE SOME ONE ELSE EVEN A SISTER COME INTO THE HOME AND I COULDN'T THINK OF IT
AND NICEST OF ALL TO HAVE THEM SEE YOU HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE AT THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE DEAR FLATTERING CHILD SAID JULIA CLOUD LOVINGLY IT IS SO GOOD TO KNOW YOU FEEL THAT WAY BUT NOW HERE COMES ALLISON
LESLIE WAS A BIT QUIET AS THEY GLIDED DOWN THE ROAD OUT OF TOWN AND KEPT EYEING HER AUNT SILENTLY AT LAST AS JULIA CLOUD WAS CALLING ATTENTION TO A WONDERFUL RED WOODBINE THAT HAD TWINED ITSELF ABOUT AN OLD DEAD TREE AND WAS SETTING THE ROADSIDE ABLAZE WITH SPLENDOR
AND I'M SURE I'LL WRITE TO YOU AND TRY TO DO LITTLE THINGS FOR THE CHILDREN OFTEN NOW THAT I SHALL HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH BUT HER KINDLY FEELING WAS CUT SHORT BY ELLEN INTERRUPTING HER
THEN HE HAD TO MEET JANE BRISTOL AND HOWARD LETCHWORTH JULIA CLOUD WAS GREATLY RELIEVED AND DELIGHTED WHEN HE SET HIS APPROVAL UPON BOTH THESE YOUNG PEOPLE AS SUITABLE FRIENDS FOR THE CHILDREN THEY ARE BOTH POOR AND EARNING THEIR OWN LIVING
MY NAME'S HERRICOTE JOE HERRICOTE I'M PRESIDENT OF OUR CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR SOCIETY AND THIS IS ROY BRYAN HE'S THE SECRETARY THIS IS MAME BEECHER I GUESS YOU REMEMBER HER SINGING SHE'S CHAIRMAN OF OUR SOCIAL COMMITTEE
AND THEN THREW OPEN THE PARLOR DOOR IN THE NICK OF TIME TO SAVE HER AUNT ELLEN FROM SEEMING TO BE DESERTED ELLEN ROBINSON APPEARED ON THE SCENE JUST IN TIME TO WITNESS THE HEARTY HAND SHAKE THAT GUARDY LUD GAVE JULIA CLOUD AS HE PICKED UP THE PAPERS AND WENT UP STAIRS FOR HIS SUITCASE
NOW YOU SEE WHAT YOU LET ME IN FOR CLOUDY WHEN YOU MADE ME GO TO THAT LITTLE OLD DULL CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR BUT I WON'T DO IT THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT YOU NEEDN'T THINK I'M GOING TO THE IDEA WHY WHAT DID WE COME HERE TO COLLEGE FOR
WE OUGHT TO HAVE LEFT THE KITCHEN TILL LAST SHE ADDED WITH A TROUBLED LOOK YOU CRAZY CHILDREN DIDN'T YOU KNOW WE HAD TO EAT I TOLD THAT MAN NOT TO TAKE ANY OF THOSE THINGS ON THE KITCHEN TABLE
HE WOULD SEE THAT A SUM WAS SET ASIDE IN THE BANK FOR THEIR USE IN ANY SUCH PLANS AS THEY MIGHT HAVE FOR THEIR CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR WORK
OF TOILET ARTICLES AND BRUSHES IN NEAT COMPACT FORM SHE CAUGHT HER BREATH WITH DELIGHT AS SHE TOUCHED THE SOFT WHITE LEATHER LINING AND NOTICED THE PERFECTION AND FINISH OF THE WHOLE IT SEEMED FIT FOR A QUEEN YET WAS PLAIN AND QUIET ENOUGH ON THE OUTSIDE FOR A DOVE TO CARRY
HE HAD A FEELING THAT OLD FASHIONED THINGS WERE BEST AND IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT HE OWNED A HOUSE MOST DIFFERENT FROM THIS ONE HIMSELF AND KNEW THAT HIS WIFE WOULD NOT FOR A MINUTE HAVE TOLERATED ANY OLD FASHIONED THINGS ABOUT
AND TRY TO SAVE YOU FROM YOURSELF AND OFFER YOU A GOOD HOME WHERE YOU WILL BE CARED FOR ALL THE REST OF YOUR DAYS RIGHT AMONG YOUR OWN WHERE MOTHER WOULD HAVE WANTED TO SEE YOU YOU WILL PROBABLY GET HIGH HEADED AND SAY I AM INTERFERING WITH YOUR RIGHTS BUT I CAN'T HELP IT I'VE GOT TO SPEAK
AND SOMEHOW JULIA CLOUD FELT AS IF SHE WAS ENTERING INTO A NEW WORLD ALLISON SEEMED TO KNOW BY INTUITION JUST WHERE TO FIND THE RIGHT KIND OF TEA ROOM HE USHERED THEM INTO THE PLACE AND FOUND A TABLE IN A SECLUDED NOOK
IT'S ONLY QUARTER TO NINE AND I'M SURE WE CAN INDULGE OURSELVES A LITTLE TO NIGHT AND FINISH THE STORY BEFORE WE GO TO BED TURN THE LIGHT ON AND GET THE MAGAZINE WITH AN AIR OF FINALITY JULIA CLOUD PUT ASIDE THE DEBATED QUESTION
NO YOU NEEDN'T RETURN IT SHE SAID SMILING I SHALL NOT NEED IT I'VE RENTED THE HOUSE AND AM GOING AWAY FOR A WHILE MISSUS PERKINS WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE ACTUALLY WENT HOME WITHOUT FINDING OUT WHERE JULIA CLOUD WAS GOING AND HAD TO COME BACK TO SEE WHETHER THERE WAS ANYTHING SHE COULD DO TO HELP
AND TOLD ABOUT HER SISTER ELLEN HAD SUGGESTED THAT MAYBE HE COULD GET HER SISTER TO TAKE HIM TO BOARD TO THIS DAY JULIA CLOUD HAS NEVER DECIDED WHETHER ELLEN REALLY THOUGHT JULIA WOULD TAKE A PROFESSOR FROM THE COLLEGE TO BOARD OR WHETHER SHE JUST SENT HIM THERE AS A JOKE
OH NO HE WASN'T ALWAYS MEEK SAID HIS AUNT THOUGHTFULLY AND HE TALKED JUST AS YOU ARE DOING WHEN GOD CALLED ON HIM FIRST TO LEAD THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT HE SAID HE COULDN'T AND HE WOULDN'T AND HE SHOULDN'T
LED HER OUT TO THE UPPER PORCH WITH ITS RUSH RUGS WILLOW CHAIRS AND TABLE AND ITS STONE WALL CROWNED WITH BLOOMING PLANTS AND TRAILING VINES SHE SHOWED HER THE BIRD'S NEST IN THE TREE OVERHEAD WELL SAID ELLEN HALF SOURLY
THERE WAS SILENCE IN THE DINING ROOM WHILE ELLEN READ JULIA MOVING ON QUIET FEET ABOUT THE TABLE PUTTING THINGS TO RIGHTS SHE HAD FINISHED HER PART OF THE ARGUMENT SHE WAS RESOLUTELY PUTTING OUT OF HER MIND THE THINGS HER SISTER HAD JUST SAID AND REFUSING ALTOGETHER TO THINK OF HERBERT
YOU NEEDN'T THINK IT AND BESIDES THERE'S ANOTHER THING YOU'RE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN ABOUT AND THAT IS THAT YOU HAVEN'T ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CHURCH WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE BABY SIX MONTHS OLD YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER BROUGHT YOU HOME TO OUR HOUSE AND THE FIRST SUNDAY THEY WERE THERE
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SUCCEED YOU'VE GOT TO PULL TOGETHER EVERY MEMBER OF YOU OR YOU WON'T GET ANYWHERE AND I SHOULD THINK THAT YOU'D HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOW AT FIRST WHOM YOU GET IN OF COURSE AFTER YOU'RE PRETTY STRONG YOU CAN TAKE IN A FEW JUST TO HELP THEM BUT
WHO HAD BEEN FAIRLY FED ON MOVIES WHY HOW DID IT HAPPEN DON'T THEY HAVE MOVING PICTURES IN YOUR TOWN YES THEY HAVE THEM NOW THOUGH ONLY A YEAR OR SO AGO
PROVIDENTIAL SNIFFED ELLEN PROVIDENTIAL TO TAKE YOU AWAY FROM YOUR OWN HOME AND YOUR OWN PEOPLE AND SEND YOU OUT INTO A WORLD WHERE NOBODY REALLY CARES FOR YOU AND WHERE ALL THEY WANT OF YOU IS TO MAKE A DRUDGE OF YOU YOU CALL THAT PROVIDENTIAL DO YOU
PERHAPS YOU'D RATHER GO TO THE HOTEL AND LIE DOWN I SUPPOSE YOU ARE MAYBE WORN OUT
IF YOU GET IN TOO MANY OF THAT LAME KIND YOUR SOCIETY'LL GO BAD THE WEAK KIND WILL RULE AND THE MISCHIEF WILL BE TO PAY I SHOULDN'T THINK IT WOULD HELP YOU ANY JUST NOW TO GET IN ANY FOLKS THAT WOULD FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT A GOOD GIRL JUST BECAUSE SHE EARNS HER LIVING
WELL WELL BLESS MY SOUL IT MUST BE GETTING LATE WE'VE HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME I DIDN'T REALIZE THOSE CERTAINLY WERE GOOD BUCKWHEATS MISS CLOUD I SHAN'T FORGET THEM VERY SOON
AS SHE SAT DOWN TO ENTER INTO THE CONTRACT THAT WAS TO BIND HER TO A NEW AND WONDERFUL LIFE WITH GREAT RESPONSIBILITIES AND LARGE POSSIBILITIES HER HEART ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK UPWARD SENT A WHISPER OF THANKSGIVING HEAVENWARD
THE DETAILS DID NOT TAKE LONG AFTER ALL FOR MISTER LUDDINGTON WAS A KEEN BUSINESS MAN AND HE HAD GONE OVER THE WHOLE PROPOSITION AND HAD THE PLAN IN WRITING FOR HER TO SIGN TELLING JUST WHAT WERE HER DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES WITH REGARD TO HIS WARDS
THEY ALL SLEPT VERY LATE THE NEXT MORNING BEING UTTERLY WORN OUT FROM THE UNACCUSTOMED WORK
AND THIS IS YOUR BEDROOM SHE PAUSED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROSE AND GRAY ROOM AND LOOKED ABOUT HER TAKING IN EVERY LITTLE DETAIL WITH AN EYE THAT WOULD PUT IT AWAY FOR REMEMBRANCE LONG AFTERWARDS WELL THEY CERTAINLY HAVE FEATHERED YOUR NEST WELL
WE'RE A COMMITTEE REPEATED YOUNG HERRICOTE SITTING DOWN ON THE EDGE OF A CHAIR AND LOOKING AROUND MOST UNCOMFORTABLY AT THE LUXURIOUS APARTMENT HE HAD NOT REALIZED IT WOULD BE LIKE THIS HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER
SHE LIKES TO KEEP THEM BRIGHT WE FIND IT VERY COMFORTABLE AND LIGHT AND AIRY COME INSIDE AND SEE HOW PRETTY IT IS ONCE INSIDE ELLEN ROBINSON WAS SOMEWHAT AWED WITH THE STRANGENESS OF THE ROOMS AND THE BEAUTY OF THE FURNISHINGS BUT ALL SHE SAID AFTER A PROLONGED SURVEY WAS
BUT SHE WAS ABLE TO HOLD HER TONGUE UNTIL SHE COULD GET HER EYES ON THOSE HILLS OUT OF THE WINDOW I WILL LIFT UP MINE EYES UNTO THE HILLS FROM WHENCE COMETH MY HELP THAT HAD BEEN THE VERSE WHICH SHE HAD READ FROM HER LITTLE BIBLE BEFORE LEAVING HER ROOM IN THE EARLY MORNING
AND COULD HARDLY REFRAIN FROM THROWING HER ARMS ABOUT THE CHILDREN RIGHT THERE IN THE STORE BUT SHE STOPPED IN TIME AND LET HER EYES DO THE CARESSING AS SHE SAID WITH A TREMBLE IN HER LOW SWEET VOICE O YOU DEAR CHILDREN HOW YOU ARE GOING TO SPOIL ME
SEE HERE'S MY PLAN I WOKE UP EARLY AND THOUGHT IT ALL OUT LET'S SEE CONSULTING HER WEE WRIST WATCH IT'S NINE O'CLOCK THAT ISN'T BAD NOW WE'LL WORK TILL TWELVE THAT'S LONG ENOUGH FOR TO DAY BECAUSE YOU GOT TOO TIRED YESTERDAY
BUT WE'VE GOTTA HAVE YOUR HELP SAID THE YOUNG SECRETARY EARNESTLY THIS THING'S GOTTA GO IT'S NEEDED IN OUR CHURCH AND IT'S THE ONLY THING IN THE TOWN TO HELP SOME OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE IT'S JUST GOTTA GO
LET THE BOOKS GO TILL TO MORROW ALLISON WENT WHISTLING UP STAIRS AND BEGAN TAKING DOWN THE PICTURES BUT ANYBODY COULD SEE BY THE SET OF HIS SHOULDERS THAT HE MEANT TO GET THE BOOKS OUT OF THE WAY TOO BEFORE NOON
LIFTING MEEK AND HONEST EYES TO MEET HIS GAZE WELL WELL WELL I CAN SEE THERE WON'T BE ANY NEED OF THAT SPUTTERED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PLEASANTLY BUT HOWEVER THAT IS THIS IS THE CONTRACT I'VE MADE OUT AND I'M QUITE SATISFIED SO ARE THE CHILDREN
THEY'VE GOT ENOUGH NOW TO GET ALONG THAT GIRL THINKS SHE'S TOO SMART TO LIVE I CALL HER IMPUDENT FOR MY PART THEY WANT A HOME SAID JULIA WAIVING THE SUBJECT OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND THEY HAVE CHOSEN ME AND I MEAN TO DO MY BEST
I SEE I MUST GET SETTLED QUICKLY SO THAT I SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO RESTRAIN YOU THEY ROLLICKED FORTH THEN AND BOUGHT SEVERAL THINGS A BIG STEAMER RUG FOR THE CAR A PAIR OF LONG GRAY MOCHA GLOVES TO MATCH THE HAND BAG A SILK UMBRELLA
THAT HAD TO BE LOOKED OVER AND THERE ON THE FLOOR BESIDE IT STOOD TWO PACKAGES BIG BOXES BOTH OF THEM THIS MUST BE A MISTAKE SAID JULIA CLOUD LOOKING AT THEM CURIOUSLY ALLISON YOU BETTER CALL THE BOY AND HAVE HIM TAKE THEM AWAY TO THE RIGHT ROOM
BUT LONG AFTER THE CHILDREN WERE ASLEEP JULIA CLOUD LAY AWAKE AND THOUGHT IT OUT GOD HAD BEEN GOOD TO HER AND WAS LEADING HER INTO GREEN PASTURES BESIDE QUIET WATERS BUT THERE WERE THINGS HE WAS EXPECTING OF HER AND WAS SHE GOING TO BE ABLE TO FULFIL THEM
BUT I COULDN'T GO AND BE A A SORT OF SLACKER SAID LESLIE HER CHEEKS QUITE BEAUTIFULLY RED THAT'S ALL RIGHT YOU COME SAID BRYAN LOOKING SOLEMNLY AT HER WHEN THE VISITORS FINALLY TOOK THEMSELVES AWAY
THEN THEY WENT OFF WITH GREAT GLEE AND MANY WHISPERINGS IT IS A CURIOUS THING HOW EASILY AND QUICKLY YOUNG PEOPLE CAN SHOP PROVIDED THEY HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY AND NO OLDER PERSON BY TO HAMPER THEM ALLISON AND LESLIE WERE BACK WITHIN THE TIME THEY HAD SET
YOU MAKE JANE BRISTOL CHAIRMAN AND I'LL BE ON THE COMMITTEE AND I'LL GO AFTER HER AND TAKE HER HOME NOW WHO ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE ON IT THE PRESIDENT ASSENTED READILY HE WAS ONE NOT USED TO TAKING THE INITIATIVE BUT HE EAGERLY DID AS HE WAS TOLD WHEN A GOOD IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF
YOU LOOKED OVER YOUR FATHER'S SHOULDER AND SAW ME SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT AND SMILED THE SWEETEST SMILE THEN YOU JUMPED UP AND DOWN IN YOUR FATHER'S ARMS AND SPATTED YOUR LITTLE PINK HANDS TOGETHER AND CALLED OUT AH JAH
SO I CAN'T TELL YOU ABOUT IT BUT I REMEMBER VERY DISTINCTLY ALL ABOUT ALLISON'S CHRISTENING FOR WE WERE ALL SO HAPPY TO HAVE IT HAPPEN IN THE EAST AND HE WAS THE FIRST GRANDCHILD AND WE HADN'T SEEN YOUR FATHER FOR OVER TWO YEARS NOR EVER SEEN HIS YOUNG WIFE BEFORE
TO HANG YOURSELF WITHOUT DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO STOP IT MY OWN SISTER WHY ELLEN DEAR SAID JULIA CLOUD EAGERLY SITTING DOWN BESIDE HER SISTER YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ISN'T IN THE LEAST THAT WAY I'M SORRY I HAD TO SPRING IT ON YOU SO SUDDENLY
AND SHE WAS GRAPPLING IT CLOSE TO HER HEART FOR SHE HAD KNOWN IT WOULD BE A HARD DAY ELLEN WAS WATCHING HER SILENTLY ALMOST SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD MADE AN IMPRESSION PERHAPS THIS WAS THE TIME TO REPEAT HERBERT'S THREAT HERBERT FEELS SHE BEGAN
AND YOU DESERVE PAY FOR IT AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT SEVERAL OF THE BEST YEARS OUT OF YOUR LIFE FOR NOTHING BESIDES YOU'VE GOT TO FEEL FREE TO GIVE UP THE JOB IF IT PROVES TOO BURDENSOME FOR YOU AND YOU TO DISMISS ME IF I DO NOT PROVE CAPABLE FOR THE POSITION SUGGESTED JULIA CLOUD
FOR I FELT AS IF WE'D TAKEN SO MUCH FROM THEM WHEN WE TOOK YOU BUT I JUST SEEMED TO FAIL EVERYTHING I DID JULIA CLOUD SMILED I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS DEAR UNLESS IT IS THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEALS AND STANDARDS FROM OTHER PEOPLE
BUT THE DAY AFTER GUARDY LUD LEFT JUST AS THE THREE WERE SITTING TOGETHER OVER A GREAT STATE MAP OF ROADS PERFECTING THEIR PLANS FOR A WONDERFUL VACATION WHICH WAS TO INCLUDE A BRIEF VISIT TO ELLEN ROBINSON AT STERLING A NOISY FORD DREW UP AT THE DOOR
THAT'S WHERE OUR ALUMNI COME IN THEY OFTEN RUN DOWN TO COLLEGE FOR A FEW DAYS AND HELP US OUT WITH MONEY AND INFLUENCE AND EXPERIENCE IF YOU'VE GOT GOOD WORKING ALUMNI YOU'RE RIGHT IN IT YOU SEE WE GENERALLY APPOINT A COMMITTEE TO TALK THINGS OVER WITH THE ALUMNI
SO LESLIE WENT BACK AND FORTH CARRYING BLANKETS AND QUILTS AND HANGING THEM ON THE LINE TILL MISSUS PERKINS HAD TO COME OVER TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON SHE CAME WITH A CUP IN HER HAND TO ASK FOR SOME BAKING POWDER AND JULIA CLOUD GAVE HER THE WHOLE BOX
I DON'T SEE ANY PLACE AS NICE AS OUR TOWN DO YOU CLOUDY AND I DON'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT ANYWHERE BUT HOME ON SUNDAY DO YOU FOR REALLY ALL THE CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR SOCIETIES I'VE BEEN TO THIS SUMMER ACTED AS IF THEIR MEMBERS WERE ALL AWAY ON VACATIONS AND THEY DIDN'T CARE WHETHER SCHOOL KEPT OR NOT
SO I BETTER SAVE MY BREATH I'M SURE I HOPE YOU WON'T GO TO THE POORHOUSE THROUGH YOUR STUBBORNNESS I'VE DONE ALL I COULD TO KEEP YOU FROM IT AND IT'S PRETTY HARD TO HAVE MY ONLY SISTER LEAVE ME SO SOO OO ON AFTER MOTHER'S DEATH
HOW DO YOU KNOW ALLISON PERHAPS YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE IN THIS TOWN AND GOD HAS SENT YOU HERE JUST TO DO THIS SPECIAL WORK WELL I WON'T AND THAT'S FLAT CLOUDY SO YOU CAN PUT THE IDEA RIGHT OUT OF YOUR HEAD I WON'T NOT EVEN FOR YOU
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF IT JUST IN THAT WAY YOU CALLED CHRIST OUR ALUMNUS THE OTHER NIGHT REMINDED THE LITERAL YOUTH SOLEMNLY SO I DID ACKNOWLEDGED ALLISON EMBARRASSEDLY WELL I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT BUT I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT KIND OF LINE
YES BUT AFTER THESE CHILDREN ARE MARRIED WHAT'LL YOU DO WHO'LL SUPPORT YOU DON'T LET THAT WORRY YOU ELLEN THERE ARE OTHER CHILDREN AND I LOVE TO MOTHER THEM BUT AS FAR AS SUPPORT IS CONCERNED I'M PUTTING AWAY MONEY IN THE BANK CONSTANTLY
WELL ELLEN SAID JULIA CLOUD LOOKING AT HER SPECULATIVELY I'M SURE I NEVER DREAMED YOU CARED ABOUT HAVING ME AWAY FROM HERE YOU'VE NEVER SHOWN MUCH INTEREST IN BEING WITH ME BUT I'M SORRY IF YOU FEEL IT THAT WAY
ALTHOUGH I'M SURE ONE SERVANT WILL BE ALL THAT I SHALL WANT IN A LITTLE HOUSEHOLD LIKE THAT BUT MISTER LUDDINGTON QUITE INSISTED THERE SHOULD BE SERVANTS AND THAT NO WORK OF ANY SORT SHOULD FALL UPON ME HE SAID THAT AS THEIR NEAREST RELATIVE I WAS TO BE IN THE POSITION OF MOTHER AND GUARDIAN TO THEM
OVER THE BOX AND FLOOR AND THEN THE TWO CHILDREN CAUGHT IT UP AND ENVELOPED HER IN IT BUTTONING IT DOWN THE FRONT AND TURNING THE COLLAR AROUND HER EARS IT'S YOURS CLOUDY TO KEEP YOU WARM ON THE JOURNEY CRIED LESLIE DANCING AROUND AND CLAPPING HER HANDS
IF JULIA HAD BEEN SURE THAT THIS IDEA HAD ENTERED INTO HER SISTER'S THOUGHTS SHE MIGHT HAVE SLAMMED THE DOOR IN PROFESSOR ARMITAGE'S FACE THAT NIGHT WHEN HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO COME AND ASK TO BE TAKEN INTO CLOUDY VILLA AS A BOARDER
THERE WAS A QUIET FINALITY IN HER TONE THAT IMPRESSED HER SISTER SHE LOOKED AT HER ANGRILY WELL IF YOU WILL YOU WILL I SUPPOSE NOBODY CAN STOP YOU BUT I SEE JUST WHAT WILL COME OF IT YOU'LL FOOL AWAY A LITTLE WHILE THERE
ASSUREDLY SHE MUST BE LOOKED UP AND HELPED IF THAT WAS THE WAY THE TOWN FELT ABOUT HER POOR CHILD WELL SAID BRYAN IN A BUSINESS LIKE TONE I'M SECRETARY JOE YOU CALL THAT PRAYER COMMITTEE TOGETHER THURSDAY NIGHT AT YOUR HOUSE AT HALF PAST SEVEN AND I'LL SEND A NOTICE TO EACH ONE
I SUPPOSE SHE'D BE REAL GOOD ON A PRAYER COMMITTEE AND WOULD HELP TO FILL UP THERE AS YOU HAVEN'T MANY
CLOUDY I INSIST ON KNOWING WHAT YOU FIND TO LAUGH AT IN THIS SITUATION WHY I WAS JUST THINKING HOW MUCH YOU REMINDED ME OF MOSES SAID JULIA CLOUD SWEETLY OF MOSES SCREAMED ALLISON HALF ANGRILY
AND THEY CAN'T FIND THEIR PLEASURE THE SAME WAY YOUR AUNT ELLEN ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND AND LIKED TO GO TO TEA PARTIES AND DRESS A GREAT DEAL AND SHE NEVER CARED FOR READING OR STUDY OR MUSIC BUT I THINK YOU'RE MISTAKEN ABOUT THEIR NOT HAVING HAD A GOOD TIME
WHY NO DEAR I'M NOT MAD AND I DON'T CARE FOR BLACK MYSELF I DON'T BELIEVE IN WEARING BLACK FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT US AND GONE TO HEAVEN IT SEEMS TO ME WHITE WOULD BE A GREAT DEAL BETTER BUT I PUT ON THESE THINGS TO PLEASE ELLEN SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SHOWING GREAT DISRESPECT TO MOTHER
WHEN THEY GATHERED ABOUT THE PIANO FOR A SING HE JOINED IN WITH A GOOD OLD TENOR SURPRISING THEM ALL BY KNOWING A LOT OF THE SONGS THEY SANG AFTER THE YOUNG PEOPLE WERE GONE HE LINGERED WIPING HIS EYES AND SAYING BLESS MY SOUL THOUGHTFULLY
THEY SEEMED TO DO EVERYTHING JOYOUSLY LIKE TWO YOUNG CREATURES LET OUT OF PRISON INTO THE SUNSHINE JULIA CLOUD SMILED AT THE THOUGHT OF THEM BUT HER SOUL WAS NOT WATCHING THEM JUST THEN SHE WAS LOOKING OFF TO THE HILLS THAT HAD BEEN HER STRENGTH ALL THE YEARS THROUGH SO MANY TRIALS
THEY TOOK YOU TO THE OLD CHURCH WHERE ALL THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN HAD BEEN CHRISTENED FOR YEARS AND THEY STOOD UP AND ASSENTED TO THE VOWS THAT GAVE YOU TO GOD AND THEY PROMISED FOR THEMSELVES THAT THEY WOULD DO THEIR BEST TO BRING YOU UP IN THE NURTURE AND ADMONITION OF THE LORD
THE COLOR FLAMED INTO JULIA CLOUD'S CHEEKS IN GOOD EARNEST NOW I'M NOT LOOKING FOR SUCH CHANCES ELLEN SHE SAID DECIDEDLY I DON'T INTEND EVER TO MARRY I'M HAPPIER AS I AM
AND BEGGED A THOUSAND PARDONS FOR PRESUMING BUT CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL EVEN THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO LIKE HIM IN A WAY AND DID NOT IN THE LEAST MIND HAVING HIM AROUND BUT THE DAY CAME AT LAST ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE WINTER OR NEARER TO THE SPRING
JULIA CLOUD BADE MISTER LUDDINGTON GOOD BY STANDING ON HER OWN FRONT STEPS AND THEN WAITED A MOMENT LOOKING OFF TOWARD THE HILLS WHICH HAD SHUT IN HER VISION ALL HER LIFE THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD RUSHED DOWN TO THE CAR AND WERE PULLING THEIR GUARDIAN JOYOUSLY INSIDE
AND THERE WAS ELLEN ROBINSON HERSELF WITH THE ENTIRE FAMILY DONE UP IN LINEN DUST COATS AND PEERING CURIOUSLY HALF CONTEMPTUOUSLY AT THE STRANGE PINK AND WHITE ARCHITECTURE OF THE MANY WINDOWED VILLA ALLISON AROSE AND WENT DOWN THE TERRACE TO DO THE HONORS
WHY ALLISON YOU'RE MISTAKEN ABOUT ME IT ISN'T MY AFFAIR AND I DON'T INTEND TO MAKE IT SO I DIDN'T GET THIS UP IT'S BETWEEN YOU AND GOD IF GOD REALLY CALLED YOU YOU'LL HAVE TO SAY NO TO HIM NOT TO ME I DON'T INTEND TO MAKE EXCUSES TO GOD FOR YOU CHILD
AND THEY ALL WENT TO BED EARLY HAVING HAD A HAPPY SABBATH IN THEIR NEW HOME BUT MONDAY EVENING QUITE EARLY JUST AFTER THEY HAD COME BACK FROM SUPPER AND WERE TALKING ABOUT READING A STORY ALOUD THERE CAME A KNOCK AT THE DOOR THEIR FIRST CALLER
LESLIE'S EYES DANCED WITH HER DIMPLES AS JULIA CLOUD APPEALED TO HER TO STOP THIS EXTRAVAGANCE THAT'S ALL RIGHT CLOUDY I HEARD GUARDY LUD TELL AL NOT TO SPARE ANY EXPENSE TO MAKE THINGS COMFORTABLE FOR YOU WHILE YOU WERE MOVING
AND HE WAS STUDYING THE CALM QUIET PROFILE OF HIS AUNT'S SWEET FACE AS SHE READ IN A GENTLE EVEN TONE PARAGRAPH AFTER PARAGRAPH WITHOUT A FLICKER OF DISTURBANCE ON HER BROW ALLISON WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF LISTENING TO THE STORY
LOOKING VERY MEEK AND SATISFIED LESLIE CARRIED A SMALL PACKAGE WHICH SHE LAID IN JULIA CLOUD'S LAP YOU SAID YOU NEEDED A HAND BAG SHE SAID AND I CAME ON A PLACE WHERE THEY WERE HAVING A SALE I THOUGHT THIS WAS A PEACH SO I BOUGHT IT
LESLIE CAUGHT HER EYE WHAT IS IT DEAR DOES SOMETHING TROUBLE YOU IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH ME ASKED JULIA CLOUD PUTTING UP A PROSPECTING HAND TO HER HAIR AND HAT LESLIE'S CHEEKS WENT ROSY RED O CLOUDY DEAR SAID LESLIE I WAS JUST WONDERING
I HAVE ALWAYS RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NEVER BE DEPENDENT ON MY RELATIVES WHILE I HAD MY HEALTH ELLEN SAT UP BRISTLING AND YET YOU ARE WILLING TO GO AWAY TO SOME STRANGE PLACE WHERE NOBODY KNOWS YOU AND SLAVE FOR A COUPLE OF LITTLE SNOBS O ELLEN SAID JULIA PLEADINGLY
LOOK AROUND AND FIND SOME OF THE RIGHT KIND OF FELLOWS AND RUSH EM GET IN SOME NEW BLOOD THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID BRYAN DOGGEDLY I'M RUSHIN YOU HOW DO YOU DO IT I NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE YET SO I DON'T KNOW ALLISON LAUGHED NOW HE RATHER LIKED THIS QUEER BOY HE'S A NUT
ACROSS THE ROAD BEHIND HER PARLOR CURTAINS MISSUS PERKINS WAS KEEPING LOOKOUT AND REMARKING TO A NEIGHBOR WHO HAD RUN IN YES I THOUGHT AS MUCH THERE'S ALWAYS A MAN IN THE CASE WHEN A WOMAN ACTS QUEER NOW DOESN'T THAT BEAT ALL DO YOU SUPPOSE HE'S A LONG LOST LOVER OR SOMETHING
