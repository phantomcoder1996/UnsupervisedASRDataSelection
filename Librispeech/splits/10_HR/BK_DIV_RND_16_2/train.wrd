ORIEL LATTICED WINDOWS THEIR HUGE FIREPLACES AND THEIR GABLED ROOFS BREATHE OF THE DAYS OF HOSE AND DOUBLET OF PEARL EMBROIDERED STOMACHERS AND COMPLICATED OATHS THEY WERE UPRAISED IN THE DAYS WHEN MEN KNEW HOW TO BUILD
SUPPOSING HARRIS SAY TURNED OVER A NEW LEAF AND BECAME A GREAT AND GOOD MAN AND GOT TO BE PRIME MINISTER AND DIED IF THEY WOULD PUT UP SIGNS OVER THE PUBLIC HOUSES THAT HE HAD PATRONISED HARRIS HAD A GLASS OF BITTER IN THIS HOUSE
THE RIVER ABOUNDS IN PIKE ROACH DACE GUDGEON AND EELS JUST HERE AND YOU CAN SIT AND FISH FOR THEM ALL DAY SOME PEOPLE DO THEY NEVER CATCH THEM
AND SO THEY TURNED AND TRAILED AFTER HARRIS AGAIN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION ABOUT TEN MINUTES MORE PASSED AND THEN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE CENTRE HARRIS THOUGHT AT FIRST OF PRETENDING THAT THAT WAS WHAT HE HAD BEEN AIMING AT
HIS CONCEIT BECOMES QUITE UNBEARABLE HE CAME AND SAT DOWN ON THINGS JUST WHEN THEY WERE WANTED TO BE PACKED
BREATHE OF THE DAYS OF HOSE AND DOUBLET OF PEARL EMBROIDERED STOMACHERS AND COMPLICATED OATHS THEY WERE UPRAISED IN THE DAYS WHEN MEN KNEW HOW TO BUILD
MY FRIEND GOT RID OF THEM AT LAST
BACK TO THE LOUD CLAMOUR OF THE DRUNKEN BRAWL YEARS LATER TO THE CRASH OF BATTLE MUSIC SAXON KINGS AND SAXON REVELRY WERE BURIED SIDE BY SIDE
THAT WE PRIZE SO NOW OR IF IT IS ONLY THE HALO OF AGE GLOWING AROUND THEM THAT GIVES THEM THEIR CHARMS IN OUR EYES THE OLD BLUE THAT WE HANG ABOUT OUR WALLS AS ORNAMENTS
THE GENERAL AIR OF SCRUPULOUS ALMOST OF PEDANTIC VERACITY THAT THE EXPERIENCED ANGLER IS SEEN ANYBODY CAN COME IN AND SAY OH I CAUGHT FIFTEEN DOZEN PERCH YESTERDAY EVENING OR
FLOATED IN BROKEN BURSTS OF FAINT HEARD DIN AND TUMULT THEN BRUTAL ODO AND SAINT DUNSTAN FORCE THEIR RUDE WAY INTO THE QUIET ROOM AND HURL COARSE INSULTS AT THE SWEET FACED QUEEN
FURTHER PROVISION FOR GETTING UPSET I PACK CUSSEDNESS OF TOOTH BRUSHES GEORGE AND HARRIS PACK AWFUL BEHAVIOUR OF MONTMORENCY WE RETIRE TO REST
AND THEY TOLD HIM TO GO AND CURL HIS HAIR WITH IT
ELGIVA PERHAPS FROM THE CASEMENT STANDING HAND IN HAND THEY WERE WATCHING THE CALM MOONLIGHT ON THE RIVER
NOBODY AT WATERLOO EVER DOES KNOW WHERE A TRAIN IS GOING TO START FROM OR WHERE A TRAIN WHEN IT DOES START IS GOING TO OR ANYTHING ABOUT IT THE PORTER WHO TOOK OUR THINGS THOUGHT IT WOULD GO FROM NUMBER TWO PLATFORM
IT WOKE HIM UP AND WITH A SNORT OF TERROR HE DASHED OFF AT THREE MILES AN HOUR THE WIND STILL BLEW IN HIS DIRECTION AND BEFORE WE REACHED THE END OF THE STREET HE WAS LAYING HIMSELF OUT AT THE RATE OF NEARLY FOUR MILES AN HOUR
IN EVERY TEN YARDS OF THAT OLD WALL IF I COULD ONLY DRAW AND KNEW HOW TO PAINT I COULD MAKE A LOVELY SKETCH OF THAT OLD WALL I'M SURE I'VE OFTEN THOUGHT I SHOULD LIKE TO LIVE AT HAMPTON COURT
USED TO GET INTO AWFUL ROWS FOR SITTING UP IN BED AND READING GREEK AND AS FOR FRENCH IRREGULAR VERBS THERE WAS SIMPLY NO KEEPING HIM AWAY FROM THEM
BEFORE MANY PEOPLE ARE ABOUT BUT THERE I DON'T SUPPOSE I SHOULD REALLY CARE FOR IT WHEN IT CAME TO ACTUAL PRACTICE IT WOULD BE SO GHASTLY DULL AND DEPRESSING IN THE EVENING
AND OUT HE WENT AND LEFT US ALONE WE COULD NOT TAKE OUR EYES OFF THE FISH AFTER THAT IT REALLY WAS A REMARKABLY FINE FISH WE WERE STILL LOOKING AT IT WHEN THE LOCAL CARRIER WHO HAD JUST STOPPED AT THE INN
NINE O WHAT I CRIED STARTING UP NINE O'CLOCK SHE REPLIED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE I THOUGHT YOU WAS A OVERSLEEPING YOURSELVES I WOKE HARRIS AND TOLD HIM HE SAID
AND GOT INTO THE HAMPER AND KILLED THREE OF THEM BEFORE HARRIS COULD LAND HIM WITH THE FRYING PAN HARRIS SAID I ENCOURAGED HIM I DIDN'T ENCOURAGE HIM A DOG LIKE THAT DON'T WANT ANY ENCOURAGEMENT IT'S THE NATURAL ORIGINAL SIN
THERE WAS ONE HANGING UP IN A HOTEL AT OXFORD AT WHICH I WAS STAYING LAST SPRING AND WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS POINTING TO SET FAIR IT WAS SIMPLY POURING WITH RAIN OUTSIDE AND HAD BEEN ALL DAY AND I COULDN'T QUITE MAKE MATTERS OUT
I TAPPED IT AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING AND IT WENT UP STILL HIGHER AND THE RAIN CAME DOWN FASTER THAN EVER ON WEDNESDAY I WENT AND HIT IT AGAIN AND THE POINTER WENT ROUND TOWARDS SET FAIR VERY DRY AND
BUT HAD TO FISH THEM OUT AGAIN AS THE BARGEMEN COMPLAINED THEY SAID IT MADE THEM FEEL QUITE FAINT AND AFTER THAT HE TOOK THEM ONE DARK NIGHT AND LEFT THEM IN THE PARISH MORTUARY BUT THE CORONER DISCOVERED THEM AND MADE A FEARFUL FUSS
AND UP THE STAIRCASE OF THE HOUSE
AND SAID HE HOPED NOTHING WOULD BE FOUND BROKEN
PREMONITORY SYMPTOMS IT WAS BORNE IN UPON ME THAT I HAD FAIRLY GOT IT I SAT FOR AWHILE FROZEN WITH HORROR AND THEN IN THE LISTLESSNESS OF DESPAIR I AGAIN TURNED OVER THE PAGES
THEY HAD GOT SOMETHING TO START FROM THEN THEY DID KNOW WHERE THEY WERE AND THE MAP WAS ONCE MORE CONSULTED AND THE THING SEEMED SIMPLER THAN EVER AND OFF THEY STARTED FOR THE THIRD TIME AND THREE MINUTES LATER THEY WERE BACK IN THE CENTRE AGAIN AFTER THAT THEY SIMPLY COULDN'T GET ANYWHERE ELSE
THAT MY LIFE WAS PRESERVED AND IS STILL GOING ON IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE GOING BACK TO THE LIVER PILL CIRCULAR I HAD THE SYMPTOMS BEYOND ALL MISTAKE THE CHIEF AMONG THEM BEING A GENERAL DISINCLINATION TO WORK OF ANY KIND
WERE THE COMMON EVERY DAY HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS OF A FEW CENTURIES AGO AND THE PINK SHEPHERDS AND THE YELLOW SHEPHERDESSES THAT WE HAND ROUND NOW FOR ALL OUR FRIENDS TO GUSH OVER AND PRETEND THEY UNDERSTAND
TREMBLING WITH STRANGE WAKENING PULSES ON THE BRINK OF WOMANHOOD THE QUAINT BACK STREETS OF KINGSTON
HARRIS AND I APPEARED TO BE STRUCK BY IT AT THE SAME INSTANT WE DETERMINED TO SAVE HIM AND IN THIS NOBLE RESOLVE OUR OWN DISPUTE WAS FORGOTTEN WE FLEW ACROSS AND SLUNG THE CLOTHES OFF HIM
AND ALL THE THINGS CAME OUT I WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED
WHATEVER WAY THEY TURNED BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE MIDDLE IT BECAME SO REGULAR AT LENGTH
USEFUL PRESCRIPTIONS CURE FOR LIVER COMPLAINT IN CHILDREN
THAT THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF GRASPING ANYTHING AND SO THE MAN TOLD THEM TO STOP WHERE THEY WERE AND HE WOULD COME TO THEM THEY HUDDLED TOGETHER AND WAITED AND HE CLIMBED DOWN AND CAME IN HE WAS A YOUNG KEEPER AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT AND NEW TO THE BUSINESS
IF I WAS A CO OPERATIVE STORES AND FAMILY HOTEL COMBINED I MIGHT BE ABLE TO OBLIGE YOU
AND SELECTING A STRAW TO CHEW FIXED US WITH HIS EYE HE EVIDENTLY MEANT TO SEE THIS THING OUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE GROCER'S BOY PASSED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET BIGGS'S BOY HAILED HIM
BUT IN TWO HUNDRED YEARS TIME IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THAT DOG WILL BE DUG UP FROM SOMEWHERE OR OTHER MINUS ITS LEGS AND WITH ITS TAIL BROKEN AND WILL BE SOLD FOR OLD CHINA
AND SAT DOWN OVER BY THE WINDOW NONE OF US SPOKE FOR A WHILE BUT AT LENGTH GEORGE TURNED TO THE NEW COMER AND SAID I BEG YOUR PARDON I HOPE YOU WILL FORGIVE THE LIBERTY THAT WE PERFECT STRANGERS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ARE TAKING
CHAPTER FOUR THE FOOD QUESTION OBJECTIONS TO PARAFFINE OIL AS AN ATMOSPHERE ADVANTAGES OF CHEESE AS A TRAVELLING COMPANION A MARRIED WOMAN DESERTS HER HOME
THAT HAD SOMETHING UNCANNY ABOUT IT GEORGE PUT ON A PIPE AND SPREAD HIMSELF OVER THE EASY CHAIR AND HARRIS COCKED HIS LEGS ON THE TABLE AND LIT A CIGAR THIS WAS HARDLY WHAT I INTENDED WHAT I HAD MEANT OF COURSE
THAT THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF GRASPING ANYTHING AND SO THE MAN TOLD THEM TO STOP WHERE THEY WERE AND HE WOULD COME TO THEM THEY HUDDLED TOGETHER AND WAITED AND HE CLIMBED DOWN AND CAME IN HE WAS A YOUNG KEEPER AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT AND NEW TO THE BUSINESS AND WHEN HE GOT IN
HARRIS DREW OUT HIS MAP AGAIN AFTER A WHILE BUT THE SIGHT OF IT ONLY INFURIATED THE MOB AND THEY TOLD HIM TO GO AND CURL HIS HAIR WITH IT HARRIS SAID THAT HE COULDN'T HELP FEELING THAT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
HE SNEAKED THE CIGARETTE THAT I HAD CAREFULLY ROLLED UP FOR MYSELF AND WENT THEN HARRIS AND I HAVING FINISHED UP THE FEW THINGS LEFT ON THE TABLE
IN WHICH WERE DETAILED THE VARIOUS SYMPTOMS BY WHICH A MAN COULD TELL WHEN HIS LIVER WAS OUT OF ORDER
IT SEEMED TO ME THE WRONG SPIRIT TO GO ABOUT THE TRIP IN BUT I'M GLAD WE TOOK THE WHISKY WE DIDN'T TAKE BEER OR WINE THEY ARE A MISTAKE UP THE RIVER THEY MAKE YOU FEEL SLEEPY AND HEAVY
I FELT MYSELF BEING DREAMILY LULLED OFF INTO A MUSING FIT I MUSED ON KINGSTON OR KYNINGESTUN
WHEN THE DAINTY SHEEN OF GRASS AND LEAF IS BLUSHING TO A DEEPER GREEN AND THE YEAR SEEMS LIKE A FAIR YOUNG MAID TREMBLING WITH STRANGE WAKENING PULSES ON THE BRINK OF WOMANHOOD THE QUAINT BACK STREETS OF KINGSTON
WAS THAT I SHOULD BOSS THE JOB AND THAT HARRIS AND GEORGE SHOULD POTTER ABOUT UNDER MY DIRECTIONS I PUSHING THEM ASIDE EVERY NOW AND THEN WITH OH YOU HERE LET ME DO IT THERE YOU ARE SIMPLE ENOUGH REALLY TEACHING THEM AS YOU MIGHT SAY
WHY ALL OUR ART TREASURES OF TO DAY ARE ONLY THE DUG UP COMMONPLACES OF THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO
WE SAID THAT NOBODY HAD TOLD US SO BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT IT WAS HE WHO HAD DONE IT WELL IT'S A MOST REMARKABLE THING MOST REMARKABLE
AND HARRIS LANDED HIM ONE WITH A SLIPPER AND I SHOUTED IN HIS EAR AND HE AWOKE WASERMARRER HE OBSERVED SITTING UP GET UP YOU FAT HEADED CHUNK ROARED HARRIS
ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SEEMED TO START OFF I PULLED OUT MY WATCH AND TIMED IT I MADE IT A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN TO THE MINUTE I TRIED TO FEEL MY HEART I COULD NOT FEEL MY HEART IT HAD STOPPED BEATING
WILL IT BE THE SAME IN THE FUTURE WILL THE PRIZED TREASURES OF TO DAY ALWAYS BE THE CHEAP TRIFLES OF THE DAY BEFORE WILL ROWS OF OUR WILLOW PATTERN
NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW ON THIS LINE WE SAID WHAT YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU'RE GOING YOU KNOW THE WAY YOU SLIP OFF QUIETLY AND GO TO KINGSTON WELL I DON'T KNOW GENTS REPLIED THE NOBLE FELLOW
AND GEORGE CLUTCHED WILDLY AT THE TROUT CASE TO SAVE HIMSELF
AND THEN IN AN UNTHINKING MOMENT I IDLY TURNED THE LEAVES AND BEGAN TO INDOLENTLY STUDY DISEASES GENERALLY I FORGET WHICH WAS THE FIRST DISTEMPER I PLUNGED INTO SOME FEARFUL DEVASTATING SCOURGE I KNOW
UNUSED HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN UP STUFFING HIMSELF WITH EGGS AND BACON IRRITATING THE DOG OR FLIRTING WITH THE SLAVEY INSTEAD OF SPRAWLING THERE SUNK IN SOUL CLOGGING OBLIVION IT WAS A TERRIBLE THOUGHT
WERE THE UNVALUED MANTEL ORNAMENTS THAT THE MOTHER OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE BABY TO SUCK WHEN HE CRIED WILL IT BE THE SAME IN THE FUTURE WILL THE PRIZED TREASURES OF TO DAY ALWAYS BE THE CHEAP TRIFLES OF THE DAY BEFORE
I ASKED HIM TO COME AND HAVE A DRINK HE ACCEPTED AND WE FORCED OUR WAY INTO THE BUFFET WHERE WE YELLED AND STAMPED AND WAVED OUR UMBRELLAS FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND THEN A YOUNG LADY CAME AND ASKED US IF WE WANTED ANYTHING
JACK AND PERCH MAY BE ABOUT THERE INDEED I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEY ARE YOU CAN SEE THEM THERE IN SHOALS WHEN YOU ARE OUT FOR A WALK ALONG THE BANKS
BREAD AND BUTTER AND JAM BUT NO CHEESE CHEESE LIKE OIL MAKES TOO MUCH OF ITSELF IT WANTS THE WHOLE BOAT TO ITSELF IT GOES THROUGH THE HAMPER AND GIVES A CHEESY FLAVOUR TO EVERYTHING ELSE THERE
ONLY HE WAS MORE RESPECTABLE THAN GOOD QUEEN BESS HE DIDN'T PUT UP AT THE PUBLIC HOUSES
IS ABOUT THE MOST AGGRAVATING IT FORECASTS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE AND PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO DAY I REMEMBER A HOLIDAY OF MINE BEING COMPLETELY RUINED ONE LATE AUTUMN
THE MAP MAY BE ALL RIGHT ENOUGH SAID ONE OF THE PARTY IF YOU KNOW WHEREABOUTS IN IT WE ARE NOW HARRIS DIDN'T KNOW
AND PEOPLE WOULD PASS THE HOUSE GOING OFF IN WAGONETTES AND COACHES AS JOLLY AND MERRY AS COULD BE THE SUN SHINING OUT AND NOT A CLOUD TO BE SEEN AH WE SAID AS WE STOOD LOOKING OUT AT THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW WON'T THEY COME HOME SOAKED
AND SAYS OH NO SIR
THE LANDLADY WOULD COME IN TO ASK IF WE WEREN'T GOING OUT AS IT SEEMED SUCH A LOVELY DAY NO NO WE REPLIED WITH A KNOWING CHUCKLE NOT WE WE DON'T MEAN TO GET WET NO NO AND WHEN THE AFTERNOON WAS NEARLY GONE AND STILL THERE WAS NO SIGN OF RAIN
BY OUR PAYING ATTENTION TO THE WEATHER REPORT OF THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER HEAVY SHOWERS WITH THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE EXPECTED TO DAY IT WOULD SAY ON MONDAY AND SO WE WOULD GIVE UP OUR PICNIC AND STOP INDOORS ALL DAY WAITING FOR THE RAIN
HE WOULD LOLL ON THE SOFA AND WATCH ME DOING THINGS BY THE HOUR TOGETHER FOLLOWING ME ROUND THE ROOM WITH HIS EYES WHEREVER I WENT HE SAID IT DID HIM REAL GOOD TO LOOK ON AT ME MESSING ABOUT
ANYHOW THEY HAD GOT SOMETHING TO START FROM THEN THEY DID KNOW WHERE THEY WERE AND THE MAP WAS ONCE MORE CONSULTED AND THE THING SEEMED SIMPLER THAN EVER AND OFF THEY STARTED FOR THE THIRD TIME
FOR THOSE WHOSE FANCY DOES NOT LIE THAT WAY IT WOULD BE LIKE LIVING IN A CHURCH NO WHAT WAS SAD IN HIS CASE WAS THAT HE WHO DIDN'T CARE FOR CARVED OAK
IT WILL BREAK ALL RIGHT ENOUGH SIR AH
BECAUSE AS A MATTER OF FACT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT I DID CATCH IT BUT FANCY YOUR GUESSING IT LIKE THAT DEAR ME IT'S REALLY A MOST REMARKABLE THING AND THEN HE WENT ON AND TOLD US HOW IT HAD TAKEN HIM HALF AN HOUR TO LAND IT
A FEW MOMENTS PASSED AND THEN THE OLD GENTLEMAN BEGAN TO FIDGET VERY CLOSE IN HERE HE SAID QUITE OPPRESSIVE SAID THE MAN NEXT HIM AND THEN THEY BOTH BEGAN SNIFFING AND AT THE THIRD SNIFF THEY CAUGHT IT RIGHT ON THE CHEST
IF THERE WAS ANY KNOWN DISEASE GOING WITHIN TEN MILES OF HIM HE HAD IT AND HAD IT BADLY HE WOULD TAKE BRONCHITIS IN THE DOG DAYS AND HAVE HAY FEVER AT CHRISTMAS AFTER A SIX WEEKS PERIOD OF DROUGHT
AND TOOK A WALK THROUGH THE TOWN TO ESCAPE IT BUT IT FOLLOWED US THE WHOLE TOWN WAS FULL OF OIL WE PASSED THROUGH THE CHURCH YARD AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE PEOPLE HAD BEEN BURIED IN OIL THE HIGH STREET STUNK OF OIL
WHATEVER WAY THEY TURNED BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE MIDDLE IT BECAME SO REGULAR AT LENGTH THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE STOPPED THERE AND WAITED FOR THE OTHERS TO TAKE A WALK ROUND AND COME BACK TO THEM
CHOLERA I HAD WITH SEVERE COMPLICATIONS AND DIPHTHERIA I SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BORN WITH I PLODDED CONSCIENTIOUSLY THROUGH THE TWENTY SIX LETTERS AND THE ONLY MALADY I COULD CONCLUDE I HAD NOT GOT
THE WASHERWOMAN AT STREATLEY SAID SHE FELT SHE OWED IT TO HERSELF TO CHARGE US JUST THREE TIMES THE USUAL PRICES FOR THAT WASH SHE SAID IT HAD NOT BEEN LIKE WASHING IT HAD BEEN MORE IN THE NATURE OF EXCAVATING
SOMEWHAT STARTLING THOUGH CHEERFUL PAPER OF A BLUE GROUND THERE WAS NOTHING HOWEVER REMARKABLE ABOUT THE APARTMENT AND MY FRIEND WONDERED WHY HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT THERE THE PROPRIETOR WENT UP TO THE PAPER AND TAPPED IT IT GAVE FORTH A WOODEN SOUND
I NEVER KNEW ANYBODY CATCH ANYTHING UP THE THAMES EXCEPT MINNOWS AND DEAD CATS BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO OF COURSE WITH FISHING THE LOCAL FISHERMAN'S GUIDE DOESN'T SAY A WORD ABOUT CATCHING ANYTHING ALL IT SAYS IS THE PLACE IS
WHAT I SUFFER IN THAT WAY NO TONGUE CAN TELL FROM MY EARLIEST INFANCY I HAVE BEEN A MARTYR TO IT AS A BOY THE DISEASE HARDLY EVER LEFT ME FOR A DAY
AND AFTER THAT TAKE THEIR DIPLOMA THEN I WONDERED HOW LONG I HAD TO LIVE
NO YOUR ACCOMPLISHED ANGLER WOULD SCORN TO TELL A LIE THAT WAY HIS METHOD IS A STUDY IN ITSELF HE COMES IN QUIETLY WITH HIS HAT ON APPROPRIATES THE MOST COMFORTABLE CHAIR
I FELT MY PULSE I COULD NOT AT FIRST FEEL ANY PULSE AT ALL
HE TOLD US THAT IT HAD BEEN A FINE DAY TO DAY AND WE TOLD HIM THAT IT HAD BEEN A FINE DAY YESTERDAY
GOT UP AND LEFT HIS SEAT AND SAT ON HIS BACK AND STUCK HIS LEGS IN THE AIR
AND REDUCE IT TO FAHRENHEIT AND EVEN THEN I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER BUT WHO WANTS TO BE FORETOLD THE WEATHER
WITH GENERAL DEPRESSION OVER THE MIDLAND COUNTIES LONDON AND CHANNEL BAR FALLING I DO THINK THAT OF ALL THE SILLY IRRITATING TOMFOOLISHNESS BY WHICH WE ARE PLAGUED THIS WEATHER FORECAST FRAUD
WHEN HE CALLED THERE FOR ORDERS THE MORNING AFTER THE CRIME ASSISTED BY NO TWENTY ONE WHO HAPPENED TO BE ON THE STEP AT THE TIME TO PROVE A COMPLETE ALIBI IT WOULD HAVE GONE HARD WITH HIM I DIDN'T KNOW BIGGS'S BOY AT THAT TIME BUT
THEIR TAKING IT IN THE WAY THEY DID IRRITATED ME THERE IS NOTHING DOES IRRITATE ME MORE THAN SEEING OTHER PEOPLE SITTING ABOUT DOING NOTHING WHEN I'M WORKING I LIVED WITH A MAN ONCE WHO USED TO MAKE ME MAD THAT WAY
AND THEY WOULD WAIT THERE FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND THEN HE WOULD REAPPEAR AGAIN IN EXACTLY THE SAME SPOT AND ASK THEM WHERE THEY HAD BEEN THEY HAD TO WAIT TILL ONE OF THE OLD KEEPERS CAME BACK FROM HIS DINNER BEFORE THEY GOT OUT
FOUND AS I EXPECTED THAT I HAD THAT TOO BEGAN TO GET INTERESTED IN MY CASE AND DETERMINED TO SIFT IT TO THE BOTTOM AND SO STARTED ALPHABETICALLY
I DO NOT ADMIRE IT MYSELF CONSIDERED AS A WORK OF ART I MAY SAY IT IRRITATES ME THOUGHTLESS FRIENDS JEER AT IT AND EVEN MY LANDLADY HERSELF HAS NO ADMIRATION FOR IT
IT WAS AWFUL GLOOMY BEFORE
AND WITHOUT EVEN A TINGE OF BITTERNESS IN HIS TONE AS HE REFILLS HIS PIPE AND REQUESTS THE LANDLORD TO BRING HIM THREE OF SCOTCH COLD THERE IS A PAUSE AFTER THIS
THEN HE OPENED ME AND LOOKED DOWN ME AND CLUTCHED HOLD OF MY WRIST AND THEN HE HIT ME OVER THE CHEST WHEN I WASN'T EXPECTING IT A COWARDLY THING TO DO I CALL IT AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS BUTTED ME WITH THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD AFTER THAT
A STURGEON A FORTY POUND STURGEON TAKEN ON A LINE SIR YES YOU MAY WELL LOOK SURPRISED I'LL HAVE ANOTHER THREE OF SCOTCH LANDLORD PLEASE AND THEN HE GOES ON TO TELL OF THE ASTONISHMENT OF EVERYBODY WHO SAW IT
BUT ON CATCHING SIGHT OF HARRIS AND ME AND MONTMORENCY AND THE THINGS HE EASED UP AND STARED HARRIS AND I FROWNED AT HIM THIS MIGHT HAVE WOUNDED A MORE SENSITIVE NATURE
WENT IN THERE TO BUY A HAT ONE DAY AND IN A THOUGHTLESS MOMENT PUT HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET AND PAID FOR IT THEN AND THERE THE SHOPMAN HE KNOWS MY FRIEND WAS NATURALLY A LITTLE STAGGERED AT FIRST
THOSE SIMPLE OLD FASHIONED REMEDIES ARE SOMETIMES MORE EFFICACIOUS THAN ALL THE DISPENSARY STUFF WE SAT THERE FOR HALF AN HOUR DESCRIBING TO EACH OTHER OUR MALADIES I EXPLAINED TO GEORGE AND WILLIAM HARRIS HOW I FELT WHEN I GOT UP IN THE MORNING
AND THE WALL ALL THE WAY UP WAS OAK PANELLED WITH CARVING
THE RIVER BETWEEN READING AND HENLEY WAS MUCH CLEANER AFTER WE HAD WASHED OUR CLOTHES IN IT THAN IT WAS BEFORE ALL THE DIRT CONTAINED IN THE RIVER BETWEEN READING AND HENLEY WE COLLECTED DURING THAT WASH AND WORKED IT INTO OUR CLOTHES
STUDENTS WOULD HAVE NO NEED TO WALK THE HOSPITALS IF THEY HAD ME I WAS A HOSPITAL IN MYSELF
THAT IS WHY WE CROWD INTO THE TOWNS AND CITIES AND THE COUNTRY GROWS MORE AND MORE DESERTED EVERY YEAR IN THE SUNLIGHT IN THE DAYTIME WHEN NATURE IS ALIVE AND BUSY ALL AROUND US WE LIKE THE OPEN HILL SIDES AND THE DEEP WOODS WELL ENOUGH BUT IN THE NIGHT
AND I LOOKED AT THE PILES OF PLATES AND CUPS AND KETTLES AND BOTTLES AND JARS AND PIES AND STOVES AND CAKES AND TOMATOES
THE OVERSTRAIN UPON OUR BRAINS HAS PRODUCED A GENERAL DEPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM CHANGE OF SCENE AND ABSENCE OF THE NECESSITY FOR THOUGHT WILL RESTORE THE MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM
YOU CAN'T TELL WHETHER YOU ARE EATING APPLE PIE OR GERMAN SAUSAGE OR STRAWBERRIES AND CREAM IT ALL SEEMS CHEESE THERE IS TOO MUCH ODOUR ABOUT CHEESE I REMEMBER A FRIEND OF MINE
AND WHAT HIS WIFE SAID WHEN HE GOT HOME AND OF WHAT JOE BUGGLES THOUGHT ABOUT IT I ASKED THE LANDLORD OF AN INN UP THE RIVER ONCE IF IT DID NOT INJURE HIM SOMETIMES LISTENING TO THE TALES THAT THE FISHERMEN ABOUT THERE TOLD HIM AND HE SAID
I CAN'T HELP IT HOWEVER I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING BUT STARTED THE PACKING IT SEEMED A LONGER JOB THAN I HAD THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE BUT I GOT THE BAG FINISHED AT LAST AND I SAT ON IT AND STRAPPED IT
NOTHING WE COULD THINK OF SEEMED TO MAKE US ILL UNTIL THE HOLIDAYS BEGAN THEN ON THE BREAKING UP DAY WE CAUGHT COLDS AND WHOOPING COUGH AND ALL KINDS OF DISORDERS WHICH LASTED TILL THE TERM RECOMMENCED WHEN IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING WE COULD MANOEUVRE TO THE CONTRARY
AND LONG FOR THE GAS LIT STREETS AND THE SOUND OF HUMAN VOICES
WE WENT UPSTAIRS AND ASKED THE TRAFFIC SUPERINTENDENT AND HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD JUST MET A MAN WHO SAID HE HAD SEEN IT AT NUMBER THREE PLATFORM WE WENT TO NUMBER THREE PLATFORM
WHERE THEY CAME DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE LOOKED QUITE PICTURESQUE IN THE FLASHING SUNLIGHT THE GLINTING RIVER WITH ITS DRIFTING BARGES THE WOODED TOWPATH THE TRIM KEPT VILLAS ON THE OTHER SIDE HARRIS IN A RED AND ORANGE BLAZER GRUNTING AWAY AT THE SCULLS
IN A MOMENT OF ENTHUSIASM DURING CONVERSATION REFERRED TO AS A HORSE
THE GREATEST NUMBER OF FISH HE EVER CAUGHT IN ONE DAY WAS THREE AND YOU CAN'T ADD TWENTY FIVE PER CENT TO THREE AT LEAST NOT IN FISH SO HE INCREASED HIS PERCENTAGE TO THIRTY THREE AND A THIRD
AND THE WALL ALL THE WAY UP WAS OAK PANELLED WITH CARVING THAT WOULD HAVE DONE CREDIT TO A PALACE FROM THE STAIRS THEY WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM WHICH WAS A LARGE BRIGHT ROOM DECORATED WITH A
FOR SITTING UP IN BED AND READING GREEK AND AS FOR FRENCH IRREGULAR VERBS THERE WAS SIMPLY NO KEEPING HIM AWAY FROM THEM
THE WEATHER IS A THING THAT IS BEYOND ME ALTOGETHER I NEVER CAN UNDERSTAND IT THE BAROMETER IS USELESS IT IS AS MISLEADING AS THE NEWSPAPER FORECAST
I CALLED FOR THE CHEESES AND TOOK THEM AWAY IN A CAB IT WAS A RAMSHACKLE AFFAIR DRAGGED ALONG BY A KNOCK KNEED BROKEN WINDED SOMNAMBULIST WHICH HIS OWNER
AND EXCUSES ITS PRESENCE BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HER AUNT GAVE IT TO HER BUT IN TWO HUNDRED YEARS TIME IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THAT DOG WILL BE DUG UP FROM SOMEWHERE OR OTHER MINUS ITS LEGS AND WITH ITS TAIL BROKEN
AND HARRIS AND I BEGAN TO FEEL RATHER ASHAMED OF IT THOUGH WHY WE SHOULD BE I CAN'T SEE NO CAB CAME BY BUT THE STREET BOYS DID AND GOT INTERESTED IN THE SHOW APPARENTLY AND STOPPED
WHICH YOU MIXED WITH WATER AND CALLED LEMONADE PLENTY OF TEA AND A BOTTLE OF WHISKY IN CASE AS GEORGE SAID WE GOT UPSET IT SEEMED TO ME THAT GEORGE HARPED TOO MUCH ON THE GETTING UPSET IDEA
BUT WE FOUND OUT AFTER A WHILE AND SEPARATED OURSELVES HARRIS HOWEVER SAID HE HAD DONE ENOUGH FOR A BIT AND PROPOSED THAT I SHOULD TAKE A TURN SO AS WE WERE IN I GOT OUT AND TOOK THE TOW LINE AND RAN THE BOAT ON PAST HAMPTON COURT
AND TO GET YOU INTERESTED THEN HARRIS PACKED THE STRAWBERRY JAM ON TOP OF A TOMATO AND SQUASHED IT AND THEY HAD TO PICK OUT THE TOMATO WITH A TEASPOON AND THEN IT WAS GEORGE'S TURN AND HE TROD ON THE BUTTER I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
THEY SAID THEY WOULD CONSIDER THE IDEA IF THE NUMBER WERE DOUBLED AND EACH FISH COUNTED AS TWENTY IF EVER YOU HAVE AN EVENING TO SPARE UP THE RIVER I SHOULD ADVISE YOU TO DROP INTO ONE OF THE LITTLE VILLAGE INNS AND TAKE A SEAT IN THE TAP ROOM
AND I PUT IT IN MY POCKET AND WENT OUT I DID NOT OPEN IT
WE WERE SITTING IN MY ROOM SMOKING AND TALKING ABOUT HOW BAD WE WERE BAD FROM A MEDICAL POINT OF VIEW I MEAN OF COURSE WE WERE ALL FEELING SEEDY AND WE WERE GETTING QUITE NERVOUS ABOUT IT HARRIS SAID HE FELT SUCH EXTRAORDINARY FITS OF
I DREAM THAT I HAVEN'T PACKED IT AND WAKE UP IN A COLD PERSPIRATION AND GET OUT OF BED AND HUNT FOR IT AND IN THE MORNING I PACK IT BEFORE I HAVE USED IT AND HAVE TO UNPACK AGAIN TO GET IT AND IT IS ALWAYS THE LAST THING I TURN OUT OF THE BAG
I CAUGHT HIM JUST BELOW THE BRIDGE WITH A MINNOW THEY TOLD ME HE WUR IN THE RIVER AND I SAID I'D HAVE HIM AND SO I DID YOU DON'T SEE MANY FISH THAT SIZE ABOUT HERE NOW I'M THINKING GOOD NIGHT GENTLEMEN GOOD NIGHT
AND SPECULATE AS TO HOW BEAUTIFUL THE BIT OF THE TAIL THAT IS LOST NO DOUBT WAS WE IN THIS AGE DO NOT SEE THE BEAUTY OF THAT DOG
I HAD NOT GOT SUFFICIENT IMAGINATION THEY SAID THAT AS A POET OR A SHILLING SHOCKER OR A REPORTER OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND I MIGHT BE SATISFACTORY BUT THAT TO GAIN ANY POSITION AS A THAMES ANGLER
I CAN'T SAY I ALTOGETHER BLAME THE MAN WHICH IS DOUBTLESS A GREAT RELIEF TO HIS MIND FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW WHICH WOULD BE THAT OF THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLDER DESIRING TO TAKE LIFE AS LIGHTLY AS POSSIBLE AND NOT THAT OF THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP MANIAC
WHAT HE SHRIEKED JUMPING OUT OF BED INTO THE BATH WHO THE THUNDER PUT THIS THING HERE WE TOLD HIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN A FOOL NOT TO SEE THE BATH WE FINISHED DRESSING
AND DETERMINED TO DO WITHOUT HOUSEMAID'S KNEE GOUT IN ITS MOST MALIGNANT STAGE IT WOULD APPEAR HAD SEIZED ME WITHOUT MY BEING AWARE OF IT AND ZYMOSIS I HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN SUFFERING WITH FROM BOYHOOD
WHO WHEN ASKED IF SHE COULD STAND THE SMELL REPLIED WHAT SMELL AND WHO WHEN TAKEN CLOSE TO THE CHEESES AND TOLD TO SNIFF HARD SAID SHE COULD DETECT A FAINT ODOUR OF MELONS
MUSINGS ON ANTIQUITY I FORGET THAT I AM STEERING INTERESTING RESULT HAMPTON COURT MAZE HARRIS AS A GUIDE IT WAS A GLORIOUS MORNING
CHUCKLE HEADED CRACK JAWED LAUGHS OF HIS THEY DO MAKE ME SO WILD I OPENED THE BAG AND PACKED THE BOOTS IN AND THEN JUST AS I WAS GOING TO CLOSE IT A HORRIBLE IDEA OCCURRED TO ME
HE WOULD BE STRICKEN DOWN WITH RHEUMATIC FEVER AND HE WOULD GO OUT IN A NOVEMBER FOG AND COME HOME WITH A SUNSTROKE THEY PUT HIM UNDER LAUGHING GAS ONE YEAR POOR LAD AND DREW ALL HIS TEETH AND GAVE HIM A FALSE SET BECAUSE HE SUFFERED SO TERRIBLY WITH TOOTHACHE AND THEN IT TURNED TO
NOW DREW NEARER AND NOW DIED AWAY AND ALL WAS DEATH LIKE SILENCE SAVE THE BEATING OF ONE'S OWN HEART WE ARE CREATURES OF THE SUN WE MEN AND WOMEN WE LOVE LIGHT AND LIFE
I'D GONE OUT PIKE FISHING BLESS YOU NEVER THINKING OF A TROUT AND WHEN I SAW THAT WHOPPER ON THE END OF MY LINE BLEST IF IT DIDN'T QUITE TAKE ME ABACK WELL YOU SEE HE WEIGHED TWENTY SIX POUND GOOD NIGHT GENTLEMEN GOOD NIGHT
ALL RIGHT TOM WE'LL GET IN HERE THEY WOULD SHOUT AND THEY WOULD RUN ALONG CARRYING HEAVY BAGS AND FIGHT ROUND THE DOOR TO GET IN FIRST AND ONE WOULD OPEN THE DOOR AND MOUNT THE STEPS AND STAGGER BACK INTO THE ARMS OF THE MAN BEHIND HIM
IF I GAVE A MAN A SOVEREIGN TO TAKE THEM AWAY AND BURY THEM I ANSWERED THAT I THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER SMILE AGAIN AN IDEA STRUCK HER SHE SAID DO YOU MIND KEEPING THEM FOR HIM LET ME SEND THEM ROUND TO YOU
CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WITH A POT OF BEER IN HIS HAND AND HE ALSO LOOKED AT THE FISH GOOD SIZED TROUT THAT SAID GEORGE TURNING ROUND TO HIM AH YOU MAY WELL SAY THAT SIR REPLIED THE MAN
THE DISTANT GLIMPSES OF THE GREY OLD PALACE OF THE TUDORS ALL MADE A SUNNY PICTURE SO BRIGHT BUT CALM SO FULL OF LIFE
SO EVENTUALLY HE MADE ONE FINAL ARRANGEMENT WITH HIMSELF WHICH HE HAS RELIGIOUSLY HELD TO EVER SINCE AND THAT WAS TO COUNT EACH FISH THAT HE CAUGHT AS TEN AND TO ASSUME TEN TO BEGIN WITH FOR EXAMPLE
CHAPTER SIX KINGSTON INSTRUCTIVE REMARKS ON EARLY ENGLISH HISTORY INSTRUCTIVE OBSERVATIONS ON CARVED OAK AND LIFE IN GENERAL SAD CASE OF STIVVINGS JUNIOR
AND WE CHUCKLED TO THINK HOW WET THEY WERE GOING TO GET AND CAME BACK AND STIRRED THE FIRE AND GOT OUR BOOKS AND ARRANGED OUR SPECIMENS OF SEAWEED AND COCKLE SHELLS BY TWELVE O'CLOCK WITH THE SUN POURING INTO THE ROOM THE HEAT BECAME QUITE OPPRESSIVE
AND GEORGE SAID THE CROPS SEEMED TO BE COMING UP NICELY AFTER THAT IT CAME OUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER THAT WE WERE STRANGERS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
WHO SAID THEY HAD BEEN THERE FOR THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR AND HAD HAD ABOUT ENOUGH OF IT HARRIS TOLD THEM THEY COULD FOLLOW HIM IF THEY LIKED HE WAS JUST GOING IN AND THEN SHOULD TURN ROUND AND COME OUT AGAIN THEY SAID IT WAS VERY KIND OF HIM AND FELL BEHIND AND FOLLOWED
I DO NOT ADMIRE IT MYSELF
THEN WE DISCUSSED THE FOOD QUESTION GEORGE SAID BEGIN WITH BREAKFAST GEORGE IS SO PRACTICAL NOW FOR BREAKFAST WE SHALL WANT A FRYING PAN
AND HE ALWAYS HAD CHILBLAINS DURING THE GREAT CHOLERA SCARE OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE
A GOOD STATION FOR FISHING AND FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF THE DISTRICT I AM QUITE PREPARED TO BEAR OUT THIS STATEMENT THERE IS NO SPOT IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU CAN GET MORE FISHING
THE LONG STRAIGHT ONES I NEVER CAN MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF THOSE THERE IS ONE SIDE FOR TEN A M YESTERDAY AND ONE SIDE FOR TEN A M TO DAY BUT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET THERE AS EARLY AS TEN YOU KNOW
A WEEK ON THE ROLLING DEEP
AND I WAS JUST ABOUT GIVING IT UP AS A BAD JOB WHEN I SUDDENLY FELT A RATHER SMART PULL AT THE LINE I THOUGHT IT WAS ANOTHER LITTLE ONE AND I WENT TO JERK IT UP
GIDDINESS COME OVER HIM AT TIMES THAT HE HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING
DESCRIBED IN THE CHARGE SHEET AS A MEDICAL STUDENT SO THAT HE NATURALLY HAS A SOMEWHAT FAMILY PHYSICIANARY WAY OF PUTTING THINGS I AGREED WITH GEORGE AND SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD SEEK OUT SOME RETIRED AND OLD WORLD SPOT
BUT THERE I DON'T SUPPOSE I SHOULD REALLY CARE FOR IT WHEN IT CAME TO ACTUAL PRACTICE
AND THEN I REPACK AND FORGET IT AND HAVE TO RUSH UPSTAIRS FOR IT AT THE LAST MOMENT AND CARRY IT TO THE RAILWAY STATION
ORIGINAL MOTION CARRIED BY MAJORITY OF THREE TO ONE THERE WERE FOUR OF US GEORGE
AND WILLIAM HARRIS TOLD US HOW HE FELT WHEN HE WENT TO BED AND GEORGE STOOD ON THE HEARTH RUG AND GAVE US A CLEVER AND POWERFUL PIECE OF ACTING ILLUSTRATIVE OF HOW HE FELT IN THE NIGHT GEORGE FANCIES HE IS ILL
HATED KYNINGESTUN THE CORONATION FEAST HAD BEEN TOO MUCH FOR HIM MAYBE BOAR'S HEAD STUFFED WITH SUGAR PLUMS DID NOT AGREE WITH HIM IT WOULDN'T WITH ME I KNOW
SAID THE MAN RIGHT IT IS WE ANSWERED AND WITH HARRIS AT THE SCULLS AND I AT THE TILLER LINES AND MONTMORENCY UNHAPPY AND DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS IN THE PROW
A TEA POT AND A KETTLE AND A METHYLATED SPIRIT STOVE NO OIL SAID GEORGE WITH A SIGNIFICANT LOOK AND HARRIS AND I AGREED WE HAD TAKEN UP AN OIL STOVE ONCE BUT NEVER AGAIN
THEY COME AND STAND HALF OUT OF THE WATER WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN FOR BISCUITS AND IF YOU GO FOR A BATHE THEY CROWD ROUND AND GET IN YOUR WAY AND IRRITATE YOU BUT THEY ARE NOT TO BE HAD BY A BIT OF WORM ON THE END OF A HOOK NOR ANYTHING LIKE IT
THE WORLD SEEMS SO LONESOME AND WE GET FRIGHTENED LIKE CHILDREN IN A SILENT HOUSE THEN WE SIT AND SOB AND LONG FOR THE GAS LIT STREETS AND THE SOUND OF HUMAN VOICES AND THE ANSWERING THROB OF HUMAN LIFE WE FEEL SO HELPLESS AND SO LITTLE IN THE GREAT STILLNESS
SAVE THE BEATING OF ONE'S OWN HEART WE ARE CREATURES OF THE SUN WE MEN AND WOMEN WE LOVE LIGHT AND LIFE THAT IS WHY WE CROWD INTO THE TOWNS AND CITIES AND THE COUNTRY GROWS MORE AND MORE DESERTED EVERY YEAR
AND IT JUMPED UP AND POINTED TO VERY DRY THE BOOTS STOPPED AS HE WAS PASSING AND SAID HE EXPECTED IT MEANT TO MORROW I FANCIED THAT MAYBE IT WAS THINKING OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST BUT BOOTS SAID NO HE THOUGHT NOT
UNNATURAL NOTIONS ABOUT
SHE WAS NUTS ON PUBLIC HOUSES WAS ENGLAND'S VIRGIN QUEEN THERE'S SCARCELY A PUB OF ANY ATTRACTIONS WITHIN TEN MILES OF LONDON
AND ADVISED ME TO GIVE IT UP THEY SAID THAT I WAS AN EXTREMELY NEAT THROWER AND THAT I SEEMED TO HAVE PLENTY OF GUMPTION FOR THE THING AND QUITE ENOUGH CONSTITUTIONAL LAZINESS BUT THEY WERE SURE I SHOULD NEVER MAKE ANYTHING OF A FISHERMAN
THEY MET SOME PEOPLE SOON AFTER THEY HAD GOT INSIDE
OAK HE EXPLAINED ALL CARVED OAK RIGHT UP TO THE CEILING JUST THE SAME AS YOU SAW ON THE STAIRCASE BUT GREAT CAESAR MAN EXPOSTULATED MY FRIEND
WELL I HAD A HAUL ON TUESDAY EVENING THAT IT'S NOT MUCH GOOD MY TELLING ANYBODY ABOUT OH WHY'S THAT THEY ASK BECAUSE I DON'T EXPECT ANYBODY WOULD BELIEVE ME IF I DID REPLIES THE OLD FELLOW CALMLY
AND THEY WENT LOOKING FOR IT ALL OVER THE ROOM I'LL TAKE MY OATH I PUT IT DOWN ON THAT CHAIR SAID GEORGE STARING AT THE EMPTY SEAT I SAW YOU DO IT MYSELF NOT A MINUTE AGO SAID HARRIS THEN THEY STARTED ROUND THE ROOM AGAIN LOOKING FOR IT
HE WAS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY LAD I EVER CAME ACROSS
MADAM I REPLIED FOR MYSELF I LIKE THE SMELL OF CHEESE AND THE JOURNEY THE OTHER DAY WITH THEM FROM LIVERPOOL I SHALL EVER LOOK BACK UPON AS A HAPPY ENDING TO A PLEASANT HOLIDAY BUT IN THIS WORLD WE MUST CONSIDER OTHERS
BUT QUICKLY RECOVERING HIMSELF AND FEELING THAT SOMETHING OUGHT TO BE DONE TO ENCOURAGE THIS SORT OF THING ASKED OUR HERO IF HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME FINE OLD CARVED OAK MY FRIEND SAID HE WOULD AND THE SHOPMAN THEREUPON TOOK HIM THROUGH THE SHOP
WELL NO SIR I'M AFRAID IT'S SETTLED DOWN FOR THE DAY HE REPLIES SHAKING HIS HEAD STUPID OLD FOOL WE MUTTER WHAT'S HE KNOW ABOUT IT AND IF HIS PORTENT PROVES CORRECT
FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS A THIRD MAN CAME IN AND DESCRIBED HOW HE HAD CAUGHT IT EARLY ONE MORNING WITH BLEAK AND THEN HE LEFT AND A STOLID SOLEMN LOOKING MIDDLE AGED INDIVIDUAL CAME IN
WE CALMED THEM WITH AN UMBRELLA AND SAT DOWN TO CHOPS AND COLD BEEF HARRIS SAID THE GREAT THING IS TO MAKE A GOOD BREAKFAST AND HE STARTED WITH A COUPLE OF CHOPS SAYING THAT HE WOULD TAKE THESE WHILE THEY WERE HOT
AFTER GEORGE HAD GOT IT OFF HIS SLIPPER THEY TRIED TO PUT IT IN THE KETTLE IT WOULDN'T GO IN AND WHAT WAS IN WOULDN'T COME OUT THEY DID SCRAPE IT OUT AT LAST AND PUT IT DOWN ON A CHAIR AND HARRIS SAT ON IT AND IT STUCK TO HIM
BUT I CAME OVER AND SAT ON THE EDGE OF THE TABLE AND WATCHED THEM IT IRRITATED THEM MORE THAN ANYTHING I COULD HAVE SAID I FELT THAT IT MADE THEM NERVOUS AND EXCITED AND THEY STEPPED ON THINGS AND PUT THINGS BEHIND THEM AND THEN COULDN'T FIND THEM WHEN THEY WANTED THEM
THE LADY UNDER WHOSE ROOF I HAVE THE HONOUR OF RESIDING IS A WIDOW AND FOR ALL I KNOW POSSIBLY AN ORPHAN TOO SHE HAS A STRONG I MAY SAY AN ELOQUENT OBJECTION TO BEING WHAT SHE TERMS PUT UPON
THEY PICKED UP VARIOUS OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO GET IT OVER
AND GAVE HIM A FALSE SET BECAUSE HE SUFFERED SO TERRIBLY WITH TOOTHACHE AND THEN IT TURNED TO NEURALGIA AND EAR ACHE HE WAS NEVER WITHOUT A COLD
NOT BY ANY ART OR SKILL BUT BY THAT UNACCOUNTABLE LUCK THAT APPEARS TO ALWAYS WAIT UPON A BOY WHEN HE PLAYS THE WAG FROM SCHOOL AND GOES OUT FISHING ON A SUNNY AFTERNOON WITH A BIT OF STRING TIED ON TO THE END OF A TREE
THE GRANDEST I HAD CARRIED IN MANY A DAY I REACHED THE HOTEL ON THE LAKE ABOUT DUSK WITH ALL MY FRESH RICHES AND MY FIRST MOUNTAIN RAMBLE IN UTAH WAS ACCOMPLISHED ON MY WAY BACK TO THE CITY THE NEXT DAY
AND THE FARMERS GRAIN ARE FRESH AS IF LIKE THE SNOW THEY HAD COME OUT OF HEAVEN
AND MANY WERE THE INTERROGATIONS CONCERNING MY RAMBLE WHEN I SAID THAT I WAS SIMPLY TAKING A WALK AND THAT ICY SHASTA WAS MY MARK I WAS INVARIABLY ADMONISHED THAT I HAD COME ON A DANGEROUS QUEST THE TIME WAS FAR TOO LATE
BUT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS FOR THE SCALDING GAS JETS WERE SHORN OFF CLOSE TO THE GROUND BY THE OVERSWEEPING FLOOD OF FROSTY WIND AND HOW LAVISHLY THE SNOW FELL ONLY MOUNTAINEERS MAY KNOW THE CRISP CRYSTAL FLOWERS
WHILE SIMULTANEOUS OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE AT STRAWBERRY VALLEY JEROME PEERED AT SHORT INTERVALS OVER THE RIDGE CONTEMPLATING THE RISING CLOUDS WITH ANXIOUS GESTURES IN THE ROUGH WIND AND AT LENGTH DECLARED THAT IF WE DID NOT MAKE A SPEEDY ESCAPE
EVEN SHOULD HIS SUFFERINGS ADMIT OF SUCH A THING ACCORDINGLY WHEN DURING THE LONG DREARY WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WE ROUSED FROM A STATE OF HALF CONSCIOUSNESS WE CALLED EACH OTHER BY NAME IN A FRIGHTENED STARTLED WAY
PAVED BROADWAYS AND BOULEVARDS SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS BLOCKS SCHOOLS CHURCHES FACTORIES AND FOUNDRIES THE LUSTY TITANIC CLANG OF BOILER MAKING MAY BE HEARD THERE
I FREQUENTLY SANK TO MY ARMPITS BETWEEN BURIED BLOCKS OF LOOSE LAVA BUT GENERALLY ONLY TO MY KNEES WHEN TIRED WITH WALKING I STILL WALLOWED SLOWLY UPWARD ON ALL FOURS THE STEEPNESS OF THE SLOPE
EARTH AND SKY ROUND AND ROUND THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE WAS ONE RAVISHING REVELATION OF COLOR INFINITELY VARIED AND INTERBLENDED I HAVE SEEN MANY A GLORIOUS SUNSET BENEATH LIFTING STORM CLOUDS ON THE MOUNTAINS
AND THE PATHWAYS OF VANISHED GLACIERS OF WHICH SHASTA HAD BEEN THE CENTER BUT AS I HAD LEFT MY COAT IN CAMP FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING MY LIMBS FREE IN CLIMBING I SOON WAS COLD THE WIND INCREASED IN VIOLENCE
THIRTY OR FORTY MILES EASTWARD FROM SEATTLE
ON THE PORTIONS MOST EASILY CLEARED SOME THREE HUNDRED ACRES OF HOP VINES HAVE BEEN PLANTED AND ARE NOW IN FULL BEARING YIELDING IT IS SAID AT THE RATE OF ABOUT A TON OF HOPS TO THE ACRE THEY ARE A BEAUTIFUL CROP THESE VINES OF THE NORTH
HALF PRAIRIE LEVEL AND FERTILE AND BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSIFIED WITH OUTSTANDING GROVES OF SPRUCES AND ALDERS AND RICH FLOWERY FRINGES OF SPIRAEA AND WILD ROSES THE RIVER MEANDERING DEEP AND TRANQUIL THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT
HE IS A DANGEROUS ANIMAL A NEAR RELATIVE OF THE FAMOUS GRIZZLY AND WISE HUNTERS ARE VERY FOND OF LETTING HIM ALONE THE TOWNS OF PUGET SOUND ARE OF A VERY LIVELY PROGRESSIVE AND ASPIRING KIND
SURELY NOTHING IN HEAVEN NOR ANY MANSION OF THE LORD IN ALL HIS WORLDS COULD BE MORE GLORIOUSLY CARPETED OTHER PORTIONS OF THE PLAIN WERE FLUSHED WITH RED AND PURPLE AND ALL THE MOUNTAINS AND THE CLOUDS ABOVE THEM WERE PAINTED IN CORRESPONDING LOVELINESS
IN THE MEAN TIME CLOUDS WERE GROWING DOWN IN SHASTA VALLEY MASSIVE SWELLING CUMULI DISPLAYING DELICIOUS TONES OF PURPLE AND GRAY IN THE HOLLOWS OF THEIR SUN BEATEN BOSSES EXTENDING GRADUALLY SOUTHWARD AROUND ON BOTH SIDES OF SHASTA
THE FROST WAS INTENSE AND DRIFTING SNOW DUST MADE BREATHING AT TIMES RATHER DIFFICULT THE SNOW WAS AS DRY AS MEAL AND THE FINER PARTICLES DRIFTED FREELY RISING HIGH IN THE AIR WHILE THE LARGER PORTIONS OF THE CRYSTALS ROLLED LIKE SAND
MOSTLY BARE THAT EXTENDS FROM NEAR THE CAMP GROUND AT THE TIMBERLINE BUT ON MY FIRST EXCURSION TO THE SUMMIT THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO ITS LOW SWELLING BASE WAS SMOOTHLY LADEN WITH LOOSE FRESH SNOW
ADVANCING WITH A MOST MAJESTIC FRONT ROLLING AND OVERCOMBING LIKE A GIGANTIC SEA WAVE SCARCELY WAS IT IN PLAIN SIGHT ERE IT WAS UPON US RACING ACROSS THE JORDAN OVER THE CITY
AND FINE VIEWS OF THE FALL MAY BE HAD ON THAT SIDE BOTH FROM ABOVE AND BELOW IT IS SITUATED ON THE MAIN RIVER WHERE IT PLUNGES OVER A SHEER PRECIPICE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET HIGH IN LEAVING THE LEVEL MEADOWS OF THE ANCIENT LAKE BASIN
IN ABOUT THIRTEEN HOURS EVERY HOUR LIKE A YEAR DAY BEGAN TO DAWN BUT IT WAS LONG ERE THE SUMMIT'S ROCKS WERE TOUCHED BY THE SUN NO CLOUDS WERE VISIBLE FROM WHERE WE LAY YET THE MORNING WAS DULL AND BLUE AND BITTERLY FROSTY
AND THE FINENESS OF THAT TOUCH NONE WILL FORGET BUT THE STORM BLAST LADEN WITH CRISP SHARP SNOW SEEMS TO CRUSH AND BRUISE AND STUPEFY WITH ITS MULTITUDE OF STINGS AND COMPELS THE BRAVEST TO TURN AND FLEE
RAILROADS AND MILLS IN THE OPENING OF MINES OF COAL AND IRON AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN GENERAL TO MANY ESPECIALLY IN THE ATLANTIC STATES WASHINGTON IS HARDLY KNOWN AT ALL IT IS REGARDED AS BEING YET A FAR WILD WEST
AND THE FROSTS AND THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING SO LATE IN THE YEAR THEREFORE I COULD NOT ASK A GUIDE TO GO WITH ME EVEN HAD ONE BEEN WILLING ALL I WANTED WAS TO HAVE BLANKETS AND PROVISIONS DEPOSITED AS FAR UP IN THE TIMBER AS THE SNOW WOULD PERMIT A PACK ANIMAL TO GO
THOUGH PERCHANCE THEY MIGHT BE SAUNTERING BY WITH LITTLE ELSE TO DO THAN CHAT WITH THEM POSSIBLY THERE MAY BE SALT LAKE FAMILIES SUFFICIENTLY PURE FOR ANGEL SOCIETY BUT I WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE RECEPTION THEY GAVE THE SMALL SNOW ANGELS THAT GOD SENT AMONG THEM THE OTHER NIGHT
I REACHED CAMP ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE DUSK HOLLOWED A STRIP OF LOOSE GROUND IN THE LEE OF A LARGE BLOCK OF RED LAVA WHERE FIREWOOD WAS ABUNDANT ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS AND WENT TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING
AND OVER ALL THE SMOOTH CROWN OF SNOW WHILE STANDING AT THEIR FEET THE OTHER DAY SHORTLY AFTER MY MEMORABLE EXCURSION AMONG THE SALT WAVES OF THE LAKE I SAID NOW I SHALL HAVE ANOTHER BAPTISM
THESE AT LENGTH UNITED WITH THE OLDER FIELD TOWARDS LASSEN'S BUTTE THUS ENCIRCLING MOUNT SHASTA IN ONE CONTINUOUS CLOUD ZONE RHETT AND KLAMATH LAKES WERE ECLIPSED BENEATH CLOUDS SCARCELY LESS BRILLIANT THAN THEIR OWN SILVERY DISKS
THE FIRST RAINS HAD FALLEN ON THE LOWLANDS AND THE FIRST SNOWS ON THE MOUNTAINS AND EVERYTHING WAS FRESH AND BRACING WHILE AN ABUNDANCE OF BALMY SUNSHINE FILLED ALL THE NOONDAY HOURS
THAT WE CARED BUT LITTLE ABOUT EATING BUT WE EAGERLY DRANK THE COFFEE HE PREPARED FOR US OUR FEET WERE FROZEN AND THAWING THEM WAS PAINFUL AND HAD TO BE DONE VERY SLOWLY BY KEEPING THEM BURIED IN SOFT SNOW FOR SEVERAL HOURS
I WAS EXULTINGLY READY TO WELCOME THEM MOST OF MY FIREWOOD WAS MORE THAN HALF ROSIN AND WOULD BLAZE IN THE FACE OF THE FIERCEST DRIFTING THE WINDS COULD NOT DEMOLISH MY BED AND MY BREAD COULD BE MADE TO LAST INDEFINITELY
AND EVEN FULL BLOWN TRANSCENDENTALISTS THOUGH YOU MAY GO FAR TO FIND THEM INDIANS ARE SELDOM TO BE MET WITH AWAY FROM THE SOUND EXCEPTING ABOUT THE FEW OUTLYING HOP RANCHES TO WHICH THEY RESORT IN GREAT NUMBERS DURING THE PICKING SEASON
ALMOST EVERY OTHER DAY DURING THE LAST THREE WEEKS SMALL LOCAL STORMS HAVE BEEN FALLING ON THE WAHSATCH AND OQUIRRH MOUNTAINS WHILE THE JORDAN VALLEY REMAINED DRY AND SUN FILLED BUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF THURSDAY THE SEVENTEENTH ULTIMO
AND I NEED NOT TRY TO TELL THE JOY THEY MADE THEY ARE BOTH LOWLY PLANTS LOWLY AS VIOLETS THE TALLEST SELDOM EXCEEDING SIX INCHES IN HEIGHT SO THAT THE MOST SEARCHING WINDS THAT SWEEP THE MOUNTAINS SCARCE REACH LOW ENOUGH TO SHAKE THEIR BELLS
EACH FEARING THE OTHER MIGHT BE BENUMBED OR DEAD THE ORDINARY SENSATIONS OF COLD GIVE BUT A FAINT CONCEPTION OF THAT WHICH COMES ON AFTER HARD CLIMBING WITH WANT OF FOOD AND SLEEP IN SUCH EXPOSURE AS THIS LIFE IS THEN SEEN TO BE A FIRE
AS IF ATTRACTED BY THE RINGING OF THEIR BELLS THEY WERE GROWING IN A SMALL NESTLIKE OPENING BETWEEN THE ROCK AND THE BUSHES AND BOTH THE ERYTHRONIUM AND THE FRITILLARIA WERE IN FULL FLOWER THESE WERE THE FIRST OF THE SPECIES I HAD SEEN
SOME GO BOATING ON THE SOUND OR ON THE LAKES AND RIVERS OR WITH THEIR FAMILIES MAKE EXCURSIONS AT SMALL COST ON THE STEAMERS OTHERS WILL TAKE THE TRAIN TO THE FRANKLIN AND NEWCASTLE OR CARBON RIVER COAL MINES FOR THE SAKE OF THE THIRTY OR FORTY MILE RIDES THROUGH THE WOODS
SHE IS A GRANDDAUGHTER OF BRIGHAM YOUNG SLENDER AND GRACEFUL WITH LILY WHITE CHEEKS TINTED WITH CLEAR ROSE SHE WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE OLD SALT LAKE ZION HOUSE BUT BY SOME STRANGE CHANCE
ON THE UPPER SIDE WHERE THE BUSHES WERE MORE OPEN BUT A COMPANY COMPOSED OF THE TWO LILIES I HAVE MENTIONED WERE BLOOMING ON THE LOWER SIDE AND THOUGH THEY WERE AS YET OUT OF SIGHT I SUDDENLY CHANGED MY MIND AND WENT DOWN TO MEET THEM
FOR TO IT HUNDREDS OF THEM OWE THEIR LIVES DURING THE FAMINE YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT GREAT DESTITUTION PREVAILED ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN SETTLEMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF DROUTH AND GRASSHOPPERS
NEVER BEFORE IN ALL MY WALKS HAVE I MET SO GLORIOUS A THRONG OF THESE FINE SHOWY LILIACEOUS PLANTS THE WHOLE MOUNTAINSIDE WAS AGLOW WITH THEM FROM A HEIGHT OF FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE SNOW
AND THREE OR FOUR HANDSOME ALLIUMS ONE OF THESE LILIES THE CALOCHORTUS SEVERAL SPECIES OF WHICH ARE WELL KNOWN IN CALIFORNIA AS THE MARIPOSA TULIPS HAS RECEIVED GREAT CONSIDERATION AT THE HANDS OF THE MORMONS
NOR IN YOUR WALKS IN THE WOODS WILL YOU BE LIKELY TO SEE MANY OF THE WILD ANIMALS HOWEVER FAR YOU MAY GO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL AND THE MOUNTAIN GOAT THE SQUIRREL IS EVERYWHERE AND THE GOAT YOU CAN HARDLY FAIL TO FIND IF YOU CLIMB ANY OF THE HIGH MOUNTAINS THE DEER
TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE BY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND SWIMMING TO THE ISLANDS OFF SHORE THE ELK AND PERHAPS ALSO THE MOOSE STILL EXIST IN THE MOST REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE SOLITUDES OF THE FOREST BUT THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GREATLY REDUCED OF LATE
ASSUMING A VIOLENCE AND ENERGY OF EXPRESSION SCARCELY SURPASSED BY THOSE BRED IN THE DEPTHS OF WINTER SUCH WAS THE STORM NOW GATHERING ABOUT US IT BEGAN TO DECLARE ITSELF SHORTLY AFTER NOON
HAVING SLEPT LITTLE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ASCENT AND BEING WEARY WITH CLIMBING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT WAS OVER I SLEPT LATE THEN AWAKING SUDDENLY MY EYES OPENED ON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SUBLIME SCENES I EVER ENJOYED A BOUNDLESS WILDERNESS OF STORM CLOUDS
MIGHT BE RAISED IN WASHINGTON FOR THE WANTS OF ALL THE WORLD BUT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PICKERS TO HANDLE THE CROP MOST OF THE PICKING IS DONE BY INDIANS AND TO THIS FINE CLEAN PROFITABLE WORK THEY COME IN GREAT NUMBERS IN THEIR CANOES OLD AND YOUNG
WE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PASS THE REST OF THE DAY AND NIGHT ON THE SUMMIT BUT ANXIETY TO COMPLETE MY OBSERVATIONS STIFLED MY OWN INSTINCTIVE PROMPTINGS TO RETREAT AND HELD ME TO MY WORK NO INEXPERIENCED PERSON WAS DEPENDING ON ME
UNDULATING HILL AND DALE SMOOTH PURPLE PLAINS AND SILVERY MOUNTAINS OF CUMULI RANGE OVER RANGE DIVERSIFIED WITH PEAK AND DOME AND HOLLOW FULLY BROUGHT OUT IN LIGHT AND SHADE I GAZED ENCHANTED
THE SNOW OF COURSE GROWING STEADILY DEEPER AND LOOSER SO THAT WE HAD TO BREAK A TRAIL THE ANIMALS BEGAN TO GET DISCOURAGED AND AFTER NIGHT AND DARKNESS CAME ON THEY BECAME ENTANGLED IN A BED OF ROUGH LAVA
WHILE ON SOME OF THE LINES OF ADVANCEMENT IT IS AT THE FRONT NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHARP RIVALRY BETWEEN DIFFERENT SECTIONS AND TOWNS THE LEADING MEN MOSTLY PULL TOGETHER FOR THE GENERAL GOOD AND GLORY
POLITICS AND RELIGION ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE STORM REACHED THE CITY I WAS SO FORTUNATE AS TO BE OUT WITH A FRIEND ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN ENJOYING THE SCENERY CLOUDS WITH PECULIARLY RESTLESS AND SELF CONSCIOUS GESTURES
IN WHICH WE FANCIED WE SAW DRY RESINOUS LOGS SUITABLE FOR CAMPFIRES JUST AS AFTER GOING DAYS WITHOUT FOOD MEN FANCY THEY SEE BREAD FROZEN BLISTERED FAMISHED BENUMBED OUR BODIES SEEMED LOST TO US AT TIMES
TURNING FROM RANGE TO RANGE STUDYING THE DARKENING SKY AND LISTENING TO THE STILL SMALL VOICES OF THE FLOWERS AT OUR FEET SOME OF THE DENSER CLOUDS CAME DOWN CROWNING AND WREATHING THE HIGHEST PEAKS AND DROPPING LONG GRAY FRINGES
OUR FEEBLENESS ACCELERATING RATHER THAN DIMINISHING OUR SPEED WHEN WE HAD DESCENDED SOME THREE THOUSAND FEET THE SUNSHINE WARMED OUR BACKS AND WE BEGAN TO REVIVE AT TEN A M WE REACHED THE TIMBER AND WERE SAFE
AND WHEN THESE SEDIMENTS BECAME DRY LAND AND WERE BAKED AND CRUMBLED INTO THE SKY AS MOUNTAIN RANGES WHEN THE LAVA FLOODS OF THE FIRE PERIOD WERE BEING LAVISHLY POURED FORTH FROM INNUMERABLE RIFTS AND CRATERS
WE MIGHT HAVE MADE GOOD OUR ESCAPE HOWEVER DARK AND WILD THE STORM AS IT WAS WE HAD FIRST TO MAKE OUR WAY ALONG A DANGEROUS RIDGE NEARLY A MILE AND A HALF LONG FLANKED IN MANY PLACES BY STEEP ICE SLOPES AT THE HEAD OF THE WHITNEY GLACIER ON ONE SIDE
THERE I COULD BUILD A STORM NEST AND LIE WARM AND MAKE RAIDS UP AND AROUND THE MOUNTAIN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WEATHER SETTING OUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER FIRST WITH JEROME FAY MOUNTAINEER AND GUIDE IN CHARGE OF THE ANIMALS
NEVERTHELESS IN THE BUILDING AND PLANTING OF THIS GRAND TERRITORY THE LILIES WERE NOT FORGOTTEN FAR BACK IN THE DIM GEOLOGIC AGES WHEN THE SEDIMENTS OF THE OLD SEAS WERE BEING GATHERED AND OUTSPREAD IN SMOOTH SHEETS LIKE LEAVES OF A BOOK
UNTIL NIGHT BEGINS TO DRAW NEAR AND LIKE FOREST SHADOWS THICKENS INTO DARKNESS AND HIS DAY IS DONE IN THESE WASHINGTON WILDS LIVING ALONE ALL SORTS OF MEN MAY PERCHANCE BE FOUND POETS PHILOSOPHERS
YET SEEMINGLY THROWN AWAY ON THOSE DESOLATE CRAGS DOWN WHICH THEY WENT ROLLING FALLING SLIDING IN A NETWORK OF CURIOUS STREAMS AFTER WE HAD FORCED OUR WAY DOWN THE RIDGE AND PAST THE GROUP OF HISSING FUMAROLES
I SAW AND FELT STILL MORE OF THE SHASTA SNOW FOR THEN IT WAS MY FORTUNE TO GET INTO THE VERY HEART OF A STORM AND TO BE HELD IN IT FOR A LONG TIME ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FIVE
AND THE PASSIONATE UPROAR PRODUCED A GLAD EXCITEMENT DAY AFTER DAY THE STORM CONTINUED PILING SNOW ON SNOW IN WEARILESS ABUNDANCE
STROKE FOLLOWING STROKE IN QUICK PASSIONATE SUCCESSION AS THOUGH THE MOUNTAIN WERE BEING RENT TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND THE FIRES OF THE OLD VOLCANO WERE BREAKING FORTH AGAIN COULD WE AT ONCE HAVE BEGUN TO DESCEND THE SNOW SLOPES LEADING TO THE TIMBER
THIRTY FIVE DEGREES IN SOME PLACES MADE ANY KIND OF PROGRESS FATIGUING WHILE SMALL AVALANCHES WERE BEING CONSTANTLY SET IN MOTION IN THE STEEPEST PLACES BUT THE BRACING AIR AND THE SUBLIME BEAUTY OF THE SNOWY EXPANSE
WHOSE SMOOTH LINEAR STRUCTURE SHOWED THAT SNOW WAS BEGINNING TO FALL OF THESE PARTIAL STORMS THERE WERE SOON TEN OR TWELVE ARRANGED IN TWO ROWS WHILE THE MAIN JORDAN VALLEY BETWEEN THEM LAY AS YET IN PROFOUND CALM AT FOUR THIRTY P M
WHICH AVOIDED PERMANENT DAMAGE FIVE THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE SUMMIT WE FOUND ONLY THREE INCHES OF NEW SNOW AND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN ONLY A SLIGHT SHOWER OF RAIN HAD FALLEN SHOWING HOW LOCAL OUR STORM HAD BEEN
AND A LOOK INTO THE BLACK DEPTHS OF THE UNDERWORLD OTHERS AGAIN TAKE THE STEAMERS FOR VICTORIA FRASER RIVER OR VANCOUVER THE NEW AMBITIOUS TOWN AT THE TERMINUS OF THE CANADIAN RAILROAD THUS GETTING VIEWS OF THE OUTER WORLD IN A NEAR FOREIGN COUNTRY
AFTER CAREFULLY SCANNING THE JAGGED TOWERS AND BATTLEMENTS WITH WHICH IT IS ROUGHENED I DETERMINED TO MAKE IT MY WAY THOUGH IT PRESENTED BUT A FEEBLE ADVERTISEMENT OF ITS FLORAL WEALTH THIS APPARENT BARRENNESS HOWEVER MADE NO GREAT OBJECTION JUST THEN
HOW BEAUTIFUL SEEMED THE GOLDEN SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE WOODS BETWEEN THE WARM BROWN BOLES OF THE CEDARS AND PINES ALL MY FRIENDS AMONG THE BIRDS AND PLANTS SEEMED LIKE OLD FRIENDS AND WE FELT LIKE SPEAKING TO EVERY ONE OF THEM AS WE PASSED
ARE TWO SPECIES OF ZIGADENAS FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA
THE MODOC LAVA BEDS MANY A SNOW LADEN PEAK FAR NORTH IN OREGON THE SCOTT AND TRINITY AND SISKIYOU MOUNTAINS THE PEAKS OF THE SIERRA THE BLUE COAST RANGE SHASTA VALLEY THE DARK FORESTS FILLING THE VALLEY OF THE SACRAMENTO
SOME CRYSTALS LANDED WITH THEIR RAYS ALMOST PERFECT BUT MOST OF THEM WERE WORN AND BROKEN BY STRIKING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER OR BY ROLLING ON THE GROUND THE TOUCH OF THESE SNOW FLOWERS IN CALM WEATHER IS INFINITELY GENTLE GLINTING SWAYING
HAS BEEN TRANSPLANTED TO THIS WILDERNESS WHERE SHE BLOOMS ALONE THE LILY OF SAN PITCH PITCH IS AN OLD INDIAN WHO I SUPPOSE PITCHED INTO THE SETTLERS AND THUS ACQUIRED FAME ENOUGH TO GIVE NAME TO THE VALLEY
AND DECLARED THE ASCENT OF SHASTA BUTTE THROUGH LOOSE SNOW IMPOSSIBLE NEVERTHELESS BEFORE NOON OF THE SECOND OF NOVEMBER I WAS IN THE FROSTY AZURE OF THE UTMOST SUMMIT WHEN I ARRIVED AT SISSON'S EVERYTHING WAS QUIET
PUTTING ON AIRS AS SOME WOULD SAY LIKE BOYS IN HASTE TO BE MEN THEY ARE ALREADY TOWNS WITH ALL MODERN IMPROVEMENTS FIRST CLASS IN EVERY PARTICULAR AS IS SAID OF HOTELS THEY HAVE ELECTRIC MOTORS AND LIGHTS
YOU MAY WALK THE DESERTS OF THE GREAT BASIN IN THE BLOOM TIME OF THE YEAR ALL THE WAY ACROSS FROM THE SNOWY SIERRA TO THE SNOWY WAHSATCH AND YOUR EYES WILL BE FILLED WITH MANY A GAY MALVA AND POPPY AND ABRONIA AND CACTUS
AND HANDSOME SHINING MATS OF THE KINNIKINIC SPRINKLED WITH BRIGHT SCARLET BERRIES FROM A PLACE CALLED HUNT'S AT THE END OF THE WAGON ROAD A TRAIL LEADS THROUGH LUSH DRIPPING WOODS NEVER DRY
ONLY THE CHILDREN HAILED THEM WITH DELIGHT THE OLD LATTER DAYS SEEMED TO SHUN THEM I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW MISTER YOUNG THE LAKE PROPHET WOULD MEET SUCH MESSENGERS BUT TO RETURN TO THE STORM
WHEN THE BLOOM OF THE SHASTA CHAPARRAL IS FALLING THE GROUND IS SOMETIMES COVERED FOR HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES TO A DEPTH OF HALF AN INCH BUT THE BLOOM OF THIS FERTILE SNOW CLOUD GREW AND MATURED AND FELL TO A DEPTH OF TWO FEET IN A FEW HOURS
THE SNOW WAS TOO LOOSE AND DEEP TO CLIMB AND I SHOULD BE LOST IN DRIFTS AND SLIDES WHEN I HINTED THAT NEW SNOW WAS BEAUTIFUL AND STORMS NOT SO BAD AS THEY WERE CALLED MY ADVISERS SHOOK THEIR HEADS IN TOKEN OF SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
BOOMED AND SURGED AMID THE DESOLATE CRAGS LIGHTNING FLASHES IN QUICK SUCCESSION CUT THE GLOOMY DARKNESS AND THE THUNDERS THE MOST TREMENDOUSLY LOUD AND APPALLING I EVER HEARD MADE AN ALMOST CONTINUOUS ROAR
GREEN RIVER IS A SMALL ROCKY STREAM WITH PICTURESQUE BANKS AND DERIVES ITS NAME FROM THE BEAUTIFUL PALE GREEN HUE OF ITS WATERS AMONG THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL THE SUMMER REST AND PLEASURE PLACES IS THE FAMOUS HOP RANCH ON THE UPPER SNOQUALMIE RIVER
AT LENGTH AFTER THE TEMPERATURE WAS SOMEWHAT MITIGATED ON THIS MEMORABLE FIRST OF MAY WE AROSE AND BEGAN TO STRUGGLE HOMEWARD OUR FROZEN TROUSERS COULD SCARCELY BE MADE TO BEND AT THE KNEE AND WE WADED THE SNOW WITH DIFFICULTY
WATCHING THE GESTURES OF THE TREES IN TAKING THE SNOW EXAMINING SEPARATE CRYSTALS UNDER A LENS AND LEARNING THE METHODS OF THEIR DEPOSITION AS AN ENDURING FOUNTAIN FOR THE STREAMS SEVERAL TIMES WHEN THE STORM CEASED FOR A FEW MINUTES
THE MAJESTIC TREES OVERHEAD LEANING OVER THE BRINK LIKE LISTENERS EAGER TO CATCH EVERY WORD OF THE WHITE REFRESHING WATERS
MOST OF WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY FAR TOO JOYOUS AND LIFE GIVING TO BE REGARDED AS STORMS SINGLE CLOUDS GROWING IN THE SUNNY SKY RIPENING IN AN HOUR SHOWERING THE HEATED LANDSCAPE AND PASSING AWAY LIKE A THOUGHT
I SHOOK MY BIG HANDFUL OF LILIES IN HIS FACE AND SHOUTED HERE ARE THE TRUE SAINTS ANCIENT AND LATTER DAY ENDURING FOREVER
A DARK BROWNISH CLOUD APPEARED CLOSE DOWN ON THE PLAIN TOWARDS THE LAKE EXTENDING FROM THE NORTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE OQUIRRH RANGE IN A NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH ITS PECULIAR COLOR AND STRUCTURE
THEREFORE HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT AND HIGH THE BRAG ASCENDING FROM PUGET SOUND IN MOST CASES IT IS LIKELY TO APPEAR PARDONABLE AND MORE SEATTLE WAS NAMED AFTER AN OLD INDIAN CHIEF WHO LIVED IN THIS PART OF THE SOUND
LEADING THEIR YOUNG FULL FLEDGED AND ABOUT AS LARGE AND STRONG AS THE PARENTS SQUIRRELS DRY AND ELASTIC AFTER THE STORMS WERE BUSY ABOUT THEIR STORES OF PINE NUTS AND THE LATEST GOLDENRODS WERE STILL IN BLOOM THOUGH IT WAS NOW PAST THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER
OFTEN CURIOUSLY FRECKLED LIKE THE PETALS OF FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA THEY ARE FRUIT RATHER THAN FLOWER GOOD BROWN BREAD BUT DOWN IN THE SAN PITCH VALLEY AT GUNNISON I DISCOVERED A GENUINE LILY HAPPILY NAMED LILY YOUNG
I HELD MY COMMANDING FOOTHOLD IN THE SKY FOR TWO HOURS GAZING ON THE GLORIOUS LANDSCAPES SPREAD MAPLIKE AROUND THE IMMENSE HORIZON AND TRACING THE OUTLINES OF THE ANCIENT LAVA STREAMS EXTENDING FAR INTO THE SURROUNDING PLAINS
THE DAY INTERVENING BETWEEN THE TWO ASCENTS BEING DEVOTED TO ESTABLISHING A CAMP ON THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE TIMBERLINE HERE ON OUR RED TRACHYTE BED WE OBTAINED TWO HOURS OF SHALLOW SLEEP BROKEN FOR OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF THE KEEN STARRY NIGHT
AND OUR GLORIOUS MORNING IN THE SKY PROMISED NOTHING BUT ENJOYMENT AT NINE A M THE DRY THERMOMETER STOOD AT THIRTY FOUR DEGREES IN THE SHADE AND ROSE STEADILY UNTIL AT ONE P M IT STOOD AT FIFTY DEGREES
WHILE IN CASE OF NEED I HAD THE MEANS OF MAKING SNOWSHOES AND COULD RETREAT OR HOLD MY GROUND AS I PLEASED PRESENTLY THE STORM BROKE FORTH INTO FULL SNOWY BLOOM AND THE THRONGING CRYSTALS DARKENED THE AIR
HUNGRY AT TIMES AND WEARY HE HAS CORRESPONDING ENJOYMENT IN EATING AND RESTING AND ALL THE WILDERNESS IS HOME SOME OF THESE RARE HAPPY ROVERS DIE ALONE AMONG THE LEAVES
THE STORM BEGAN IN SERIOUS EARNEST AT FIRST THE CLIFFS WERE BEATEN WITH HAIL EVERY STONE OF WHICH AS FAR AS I COULD SEE WAS REGULAR IN FORM SIX SIDED PYRAMIDS WITH ROUNDED BASE RICH AND SUMPTUOUS LOOKING AND FASHIONED WITH LOVING CARE
BUT IN TROUT FISHING AND BEAR HUNTING AND IN THE TWO FINE FALLS ON THE RIVER FORMERLY THE TRIP FROM SEATTLE WAS A HARD ONE OVER CORDUROY ROADS NOW IT IS REACHED IN A FEW HOURS BY RAIL ALONG THE SHORES OF LAKE WASHINGTON AND LAKE SQUAK
AND I TOLD JEROME THAT WE TWO MOUNTAINEERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR WAY DOWN THROUGH ANY STORM LIKELY TO FALL PRESENTLY THIN FIBROUS FILMS OF CLOUD BEGAN TO BLOW DIRECTLY OVER THE SUMMIT FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
MUST HERE BE EXPOSED TO TERRIBLE TRIALS CITY CREEK COMING FROM ITS HIGH GLACIAL FOUNTAINS ENTERS THE STREETS OF THIS MORMON ZION PURE AS AN ANGEL BUT HOW DOES IT LEAVE IT
THE POOL IS OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH AS IS SHOWN BY THE RADIATING WELL BEATEN FOAM AND MIST WHICH IS OF A BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR AT TIMES OF EXQUISITE FINENESS OF TONE AND BY THE HEAVY WAVES THAT LASH THE ROCKS IN FRONT OF IT
I WAS ANIMATED BY A MOUNTAINEER'S EAGERNESS TO GET MY FEET INTO THE SNOW ONCE MORE AND MY HEAD INTO THE CLEAR SKY AFTER LYING DORMANT ALL WINTER AT THE LEVEL OF THE SEA BUT IN EVERY WALK WITH NATURE ONE RECEIVES FAR MORE THAN HE SEEKS
PRESENTING A MOST GLORIOUS MASS OF WINTER MOUNTAIN SCENERY IN THE MIDST OF WHICH I SCRAMBLED AND REVELED OR LAY SNUGLY SNOWBOUND ENJOYING THE FERTILE CLOUDS AND THE SNOW BLOOM IN ALL THEIR GROWING DRIFTING GRANDEUR
MIGHT COLLECT IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO CAUSE SLEEP AND DEATH
LOOKING SOUTHWARD FROM THE SOUTH END OF SALT LAKE THE TWO NORTHMOST PEAKS OF THE OQUIRRH RANGE ARE SEEN SWELLING CALMLY INTO THE COOL SKY WITHOUT ANY MARKED CHARACTER EXCEPTING ONLY THEIR SNOW CROWNS
THE CRYSTAL FLAKES FALLING IN THE FOUL STREETS WAS A PITIFUL SIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VAUNTED REFINING INFLUENCES OF TOWNS PURITY OF ALL KINDS PURE HEARTS PURE STREAMS PURE SNOW
AND THROUGHOUT ONE HUNGRY WINTER IN PARTICULAR THOUSANDS OF THE PEOPLE SUBSISTED CHIEFLY ON THE BULBS OF THE TULIPS CALLED SEGO BY THE INDIANS WHO TAUGHT THEM ITS USE LILIACEOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE RARE AMONG THE MORMONS
HALF AN HOUR LATER WE HEARD SISSON SHOUTING DOWN AMONG THE FIRS COMING WITH HORSES TO TAKE US TO THE HOTEL AFTER BREAKING A TRAIL THROUGH THE SNOW AS FAR AS POSSIBLE HE HAD TIED HIS ANIMALS AND WALKED UP WE HAD BEEN SO LONG WITHOUT FOOD
RAISING THE SNOW IN MAGNIFICENT DRIFTS THAT WERE DRAWN OUT IN THE FORM OF WAVERING BANNERS BLOWING IN THE SUN TOWARD THE END OF MY STAY A SUCCESSION OF SMALL CLOUDS STRUCK AGAINST THE SUMMIT ROCKS LIKE DRIFTING ICEBERGS
TOWARD THE EVENING OF THE EIGHTEENTH IT BEGAN TO WITHER THE SNOWY SKIRTS OF THE WAHSATCH MOUNTAINS APPEARED BENEATH THE LIFTING FRINGES OF THE CLOUDS AND THE SUN SHONE OUT THROUGH COLORED WINDOWS PRODUCING ONE OF THE MOST GLORIOUS AFTER STORM EFFECTS I EVER WITNESSED
VIGOROUS LIFE AND STRIFE ARE TO BE SEEN EVERYWHERE THE SPIRIT OF PROGRESS IS IN THE AIR STILL IT IS HARD TO REALIZE HOW MUCH GOOD WORK IS BEING DONE HERE OF A KIND THAT MAKES FOR CIVILIZATION THE ENTHUSIASTIC EXULTING ENERGY DISPLAYED IN THE BUILDING OF NEW TOWNS
AND TO GIVE TIME FOR THE FRESH SNOW THAT I KNEW HAD FALLEN ON THE MOUNTAIN TO SETTLE SOMEWHAT WITH A VIEW TO MAKING THE ASCENT A PEDESTRIAN ON THESE MOUNTAIN ROADS ESPECIALLY SO LATE IN THE YEAR IS SURE TO EXCITE CURIOSITY
MOUNTAINEERS HOWEVER ALWAYS FIND IN THEMSELVES A RESERVE OF POWER AFTER GREAT EXHAUSTION IT IS A KIND OF SECOND LIFE AVAILABLE ONLY IN EMERGENCIES LIKE THIS AND HAVING PROVED ITS EXISTENCE I HAD NO GREAT FEAR THAT EITHER OF US WOULD FAIL
HE FIRMLY REFUSED TO MAKE THE VENTURE TO FIND THE CAMP WHILE I AWARE OF THE DANGERS THAT WOULD NECESSARILY ATTEND OUR EFFORTS AND CONSCIOUS OF BEING THE CAUSE OF HIS PRESENT PERIL DECIDED NOT TO LEAVE HIM OUR DISCUSSIONS ENDED
THE PEOPLE HOWEVER ARE IN NO WISE DISCOURAGED AND ERE LONG THE LOSS WILL BE GAIN INASMUCH AS A BETTER CLASS OF BUILDINGS CHIEFLY OF BRICK ARE BEING ERECTED IN PLACE OF THE INFLAMMABLE WOODEN ONES WHICH WITH COMPARATIVELY FEW EXCEPTIONS WERE BUILT OF PITCHY SPRUCE
OTHERS HALF SETTLE DOWN AND CHANGE IN PART INTO FARMERS EACH MAKING CHOICE OF SOME FERTILE SPOT WHERE THE LANDSCAPE ATTRACTS HIM BUILDS A SMALL CABIN WHERE WITH FEW WANTS TO SUPPLY FROM GARDEN OR FIELD HE HUNTS AND FARMS IN TURN
WHERE BREAKING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE FEET OF MEALY SNOW THEIR FEET WERE CAUGHT BETWEEN ANGULAR BOULDERS HERE THEY WERE IN DANGER OF BEING LOST BUT AFTER WE HAD REMOVED PACKS AND SADDLES AND ASSISTED THEIR EFFORTS WITH ROPES
THE STORM SIDE OF MY BLANKETS WAS FASTENED DOWN WITH STAKES TO REDUCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE SIFTING IN OF DRIFT AND THE DANGER OF BEING BLOWN AWAY THE PRECIOUS BREAD SACK WAS PLACED SAFELY AS A PILLOW AND WHEN AT LENGTH THE FIRST FLAKES FELL
I WILL BATHE IN THE HIGH SKY AMONG COOL WIND WAVES FROM THE SNOW FROM THE MORE SOUTHERLY OF THE TWO PEAKS A LONG RIDGE COMES DOWN BENT LIKE A BOW ONE END IN THE HOT PLAINS THE OTHER IN THE SNOW OF THE SUMMIT
STILL MORE STRIKING ARE THEIR QUEER CAMPS ON THE EDGES OF THE FIELDS OR OVER ON THE RIVER BANK WITH THE FIRELIGHT SHINING ON THEIR WILD JOLLY FACES BUT WOE TO THE RANCH SHOULD FIRE WATER GET THERE BUT THE CHIEF ATTRACTIONS HERE ARE NOT FOUND IN THE HOPS
A VERY DIFFERENT MAN SEEN NOW AND THEN AT LONG INTERVALS BUT USUALLY INVISIBLE IS THE FREE ROAMER OF THE WILDERNESS HUNTER PROSPECTOR EXPLORER SEEKING HE KNOWS NOT WHAT LITHE AND SINEWY HE WALKS ERECT
ILL DEFINED EMBANKMENT FROM THE ICY MESHES OF WHICH SNOW FLOWERS BEGAN TO FALL ALTERNATING WITH HAIL THE SKY SPEEDILY DARKENED AND JUST AS I HAD COMPLETED MY LAST OBSERVATION AND BOXED MY INSTRUMENTS READY FOR THE DESCENT
TWO LILIACEOUS PLANTS IN PARTICULAR ERYTHRONIUM GRANDIFLORUM AND FRITILLARIA PUDICA ARE MARVELOUSLY BEAUTIFUL AND ABUNDANT
SEEMED TO TOUCH ONE ANOTHER AND FAIRLY TO THICKEN THE TREMENDOUS BLAST THAT CARRIED THEM THIS WAS THE BLOOM TIME THE SUMMER OF THE CLOUD AND NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN EVEN A MOUNTAIN CLOUD FLOWERING SO PROFUSELY
AND ALONG THE RIVERS WHILE SALMON ARE GOING UP TO SPAWN THE BLACK BEAR MAY BE FOUND FAT AND AT HOME MANY ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR BOTH FOR THEIR FLESH AND SKINS THE LARGE BROWN SPECIES LIKES HIGHER AND OPENER GROUND
A SPRUCE AND A FIR STANDING CLOSE TOGETHER ERECT AND ARROWY IN A THRIFTY COMPACT GROWTH BUT THEY ARE QUITE SMALL SAY FROM SIX TO TWELVE OR FOURTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER AND BOUT FORTY FEET IN HEIGHT AMONG THEIR GIANT RELATIVES OF THE SIERRA
NOTWITHSTANDING ITS TERRIFIC FURY OUR FEET WERE WRAPPED IN SACKING AND WE WERE SOON MOUNTED AND ON OUR WAY DOWN INTO THE THICK SUNSHINE GOD'S COUNTRY AS SISSON CALLS THE CHAPARRAL ZONE
AT TWO O'CLOCK WE ROSE BREAKFASTED ON A WARMED TIN CUPFUL OF COFFEE AND A PIECE OF FROZEN VENISON BROILED ON THE COALS AND STARTED FOR THE SUMMIT UP TO THIS TIME THERE WAS NOTHING IN SIGHT THAT BETOKENED THE APPROACH OF A STORM
LOOKING ACROSS THE JORDAN THE GRAY SAGEY SLOPES FROM THE BASE OF THE OQUIRRH MOUNTAINS WERE COVERED WITH A THICK PLUSHY CLOTH OF GOLD SOFT AND ETHEREAL AS A CLOUD NOT MERELY TINTED AND GILDED LIKE A ROCK WITH AUTUMN SUNSHINE BUT DEEPLY MUFFLED BEYOND RECOGNITION
AND EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED HUNTERS HAVE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THEM OF BEARS THERE ARE TWO SPECIES THE BLACK AND THE LARGE BROWN THE FORMER BY FAR THE MORE COMMON OF THE TWO ON THE SHAGGY BOTTOM LANDS WHERE BERRIES ARE PLENTIFUL
THE WIND SWEPT PAST IN HISSING FLOODS GRINDING THE SNOW INTO MEAL AND SWEEPING DOWN INTO THE HOLLOWS IN ENORMOUS DRIFTS ALL THE HEAVIER PARTICLES WHILE THE FINER DUST WAS SIFTED THROUGH THE SKY INCREASING THE ICY GLOOM
NATURE TAKES THE FEET AND TEETH OF HER FLOCKS INTO ACCOUNT AND MAKES USE OF THEM TO TRIM AND CULTIVATE AND KEEP THEM IN ORDER AS THE BARK AND BUDS OF THE TREE ARE TENDED BY WOODPECKERS AND LINNETS THE EVERGREEN WOODS CONSIST AS FAR AS I OBSERVED OF TWO SPECIES
AND PLENTY OF THE LANGUID MUSIC OF PIANOS MINGLING WITH THE BABEL NOISES OF COMMERCE CARRIED ON IN A HUNDRED TONGUES THE MAIN STREETS ARE CROWDED WITH BRIGHT WIDE AWAKE LAWYERS MINISTERS MERCHANTS AGENTS FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN
THRILLED EVERY NERVE AND MADE ABSOLUTE EXHAUSTION IMPOSSIBLE I SEEMED TO BE WALKING AND WALLOWING IN A CLOUD BUT HOLDING STEADILY ONWARD BY HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK I HAD GAINED THE HIGHEST SUMMIT
AT THE SALMON HATCHING ESTABLISHMENT ON THE MC CLOUD RIVER I HALTED A WEEK TO EXAMINE THE LIMESTONE BELT GRANDLY DEVELOPED THERE TO LEARN WHAT I COULD OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE RIVER AND ITS BANKS
THE ROAD LEADS THROUGH MAJESTIC WOODS WITH FERNS TEN FEET HIGH BENEATH SOME OF THE THICKETS AND ACROSS A GRAVELLY PLAIN DEFORESTED BY FIRE MANY YEARS AGO ORANGE LILIES ARE PLENTIFUL
HE SAID THEY ARE NICE
DARKENING THE AIR AS THEY PASSED AND PRODUCING A CHILL AS DEFINITE AND SUDDEN AS IF ICE WATER HAD BEEN DASHED IN MY FACE THIS IS THE KIND OF CLOUD IN WHICH SNOW FLOWERS GROW AND I TURNED AND FLED
THE FLY CATCHER THE WALKING FERN ET CETERA I HARDLY KNOW HOW THE LITTLE BELLS I HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING WOULD BE REGARDED BY SEEKERS OF THIS CLASS BUT EVERY TRUE FLOWER LOVER WHO COMES TO CONSIDER THESE UTAH LILIES WILL SURELY BE WELL REWARDED HOWEVER LONG THE WAY
A PERILOUS NIGHT ON SHASTA'S SUMMIT TOWARD THE END OF SUMMER AFTER A LIGHT OPEN WINTER ONE MAY REACH THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT SHASTA WITHOUT PASSING OVER MUCH SNOW BY KEEPING ON THE CREST OF A LONG NARROW RIDGE
WHERE NEVER A DUST PARTICLE FLOATED AND WHERE ALL THE FLOWERS FRESH WITH MIST AND SPRAY ARE WETTER THAN WATER LILIES THE POOL AT THE FOOT OF THE FALL IS A PLACE SURPASSINGLY LOVELY TO LOOK AT WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC RUSH AND SONG OF THE FALLS
BUT YOU MAY NOT SEE A SINGLE TRUE LILY AND ONLY A VERY FEW LILIACEOUS PLANTS OF ANY KIND NOT EVEN IN THE COOL FRESH GLENS OF THE MOUNTAINS WILL YOU FIND THESE FAVORITE FLOWERS THOUGH SOME OF THESE DESERT RANGES ALMOST RIVAL THE SIERRA IN HEIGHT
AS ONE STROLLS IN THE WOODS ABOUT THE LOGGING CAMPS MOST OF THE LUMBERMEN ARE FOUND TO BE INTERESTING PEOPLE TO MEET KIND AND OBLIGING AND SINCERE FULL OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE BARK AND SAPWOOD AND HEARTWOOD OF THE TREES THEY CUT AND HOW TO FELL THEM WITHOUT UNNECESSARY BREAKAGE
THE BEGINNING OF THE OUTPOURING OF THE TREASURED WRATH OF THE LORD UPON THE GENTILES FOR THE KILLING OF JOSEPH SMITH TO ME IT SEEMED A CORDIAL OUTPOURING OF NATURE'S LOVE BUT IT IS EASY TO DIFFER WITH SALT LATTER DAYS IN EVERYTHING STORMS WIVES
THE PETALS BEING STRONGLY RECURVED LIKE THOSE OF LILIUM SUPERBUM OCCASIONALLY A SPECIMEN IS MET WHICH HAS FROM TWO TO FIVE FLOWERS HUNG IN A LOOSE PANICLE PEOPLE OFTENTIMES TRAVEL FAR TO SEE CURIOUS PLANTS LIKE THE CARNIVOROUS DARLINGTONIA
THEN SAILING OUT INTO THE THIN AZURE OVER THE PRECIPITOUS BRINK OF THE RIDGE THEY WERE DRIFTED TOGETHER LIKE WREATHS OF FOAM ON A RIVER THESE HIGHER AND FINER CLOUD FABRICS
AND THE WIDE PRAIRIE OF WATER GLOWING IN THE GOLD AND PURPLE OF EVENING PRESENTED ALL THE COLORS THAT TINT THE LIPS OF SHELLS AND THE PETALS OF LILIES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LAKE THIS SIDE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS UTAH LAKE
AND HE MUST SURELY HAVE PERISHED AND SISSON WAS BLAMED FOR ALLOWING ANY ONE TO ATTEMPT CLIMBING IN SUCH WEATHER WHILE I WAS AS SAFE AS ANYBODY IN THE LOWLANDS LYING LIKE A SQUIRREL IN A WARM FLUFFY NEST BUSIED ABOUT MY OWN AFFAIRS AND WISHING ONLY TO BE LET ALONE
THEY ALL ESCAPED TO THE SIDE OF A RIDGE ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE TIMBERLINE TO GO FARTHER WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION SO WE WERE COMPELLED TO CAMP AS BEST WE COULD A PITCH PINE FIRE SPEEDILY CHANGED THE TEMPERATURE
THE CREATIVE SUN SHONE GLORIOUS ON THE VAST EXPANSE OF CLOUDLAND HILL AND DALE MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY SPRINGING INTO EXISTENCE RESPONSIVE TO HIS RAYS AND STEADILY DEVELOPING IN BEAUTY AND INDIVIDUALITY
IT WAS THE CALM AFTERGLOW THAT USUALLY SUCCEEDS THE FIRST STORM OF THE WINTER I MET MANY OF THE BIRDS THAT HAD REARED THEIR YOUNG AND SPENT THEIR SUMMER IN THE SHASTA WOODS AND CHAPARRAL THEY WERE THEN ON THEIR WAY SOUTH TO THEIR WINTER HOMES
BUT ON GAINING THE SUMMIT WE SAW TOWARD LASSEN'S BUTTE HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES OF WHITE CUMULI BOILING DREAMILY IN THE SUNSHINE FAR BENEATH US AND CAUSING NO ALARM THE SLIGHT WEARINESS OF THE ASCENT WAS SOON RESTED AWAY
JEROME MADE A DASH FROM THE SHELTER OF THE LAVA BLOCK AND BEGAN FORCING HIS WAY BACK AGAINST THE WIND TO THE HOT SPRINGS WAVERING AND STRUGGLING TO RESIST BEING CARRIED AWAY AS IF HE WERE FORDING A RAPID STREAM
HE WAS VERY PROUD OF THE HONOR AND LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO LEAD HIS GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT THE STREETS THE GREATER PART OF THE LOWER BUSINESS PORTION OF THE TOWN INCLUDING A LONG STRETCH OF WHARVES AND WAREHOUSES BUILT ON PILES
EVEN AFTER THE STORM IS OVER WE SHALL HAVE TO WAIT FOR SUNSHINE AND WHEN WILL IT COME THE TEMPERED AREA TO WHICH WE HAD COMMITTED OURSELVES EXTENDED OVER ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF AN ACRE
SHINING WITH MARVELOUS BRIGHTNESS WITH LONG LANCE RAYS NEAR LOOKING AND NEW LOOKING AS IF NEVER SEEN BEFORE AGAIN THEY WOULD LOOK FAMILIAR AND REMIND US OF STARGAZING AT HOME OFTENTIMES IMAGINATION COMING INTO PLAY
SET IN A ROMANTIC DELL THATCHED WITH DRIPPING MOSSES AND FERNS AND EMBOWERED IN DENSE EVERGREENS AND BLOOMING BUSHES
STILL THE PAIN WAS NOT ALWAYS OF THAT BITTER INTENSE KIND THAT PRECLUDES THOUGHT AND TAKES AWAY ALL CAPACITY FOR ENJOYMENT A SORT OF DREAMY STUPOR CAME ON AT TIMES
TO LET JEROME WHO HAD FALLEN A LITTLE BEHIND COME UP HERE HE OPENED A COUNCIL IN WHICH UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EXCITING BUT WITHOUT EVINCING ANY BEWILDERMENT HE MAINTAINED IN OPPOSITION TO MY VIEWS THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED
AND INDICATED THE WAY AS WELL AS HE COULD IN THE DARKNESS HE SEEMED LOATH TO LEAVE ME BUT BEING REASSURED THAT I WAS AT HOME AND REQUIRED NO CARE HE BADE ME GOOD BYE AND RETURNED TO CAMP READY TO LEAD HIS ANIMALS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AT DAYBREAK
THAT NOW SMOULDERS NOW BRIGHTENS AND MAY BE EASILY QUENCHED THE WEARY HOURS WORE AWAY LIKE DIM HALF FORGOTTEN YEARS SO LONG AND EVENTFUL THEY SEEMED THOUGH WE DID NOTHING BUT SUFFER
WHEN THE ICE OF THE GLACIAL PERIOD WAS LAID LIKE A MANTLE OVER EVERY MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY THROUGHOUT ALL THESE IMMENSELY PROTRACTED PERIODS IN THE THRONG OF THESE MAJESTIC OPERATIONS NATURE KEPT HER FLOWER CHILDREN IN MIND SHE CONSIDERED THE LILIES
AND NOW HE SAID MAY I ASK YOU FOR SOME MORE HELP I HAVE A GREAT TASK TO DO AND AT THE BEGINNING IT IS TO KNOW YOU CAN HELP ME HERE CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT WENT BEFORE YOUR GOING TO TRANSYLVANIA
THERE AIN'T A MANY SUCH JOBS AS THIS ERE AN I'M THINKIN THAT MAYBE SAM BLOXAM COULD TELL YE SUMMUT I ASKED IF HE COULD TELL ME WHERE TO FIND HIM I TOLD HIM THAT IF HE COULD GET ME THE ADDRESS IT WOULD BE WORTH ANOTHER HALF SOVEREIGN TO HIM
AND NEVER LET HIM BE TROUBLED OR WORRIED WITH IT AT ALL IF EVER JONATHAN QUITE GETS OVER THE NERVOUSNESS HE MAY WANT TO TELL ME OF IT ALL AND I CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS AND FIND OUT THINGS AND SEE HOW I MAY COMFORT HIM LETTER
OH LET ME IMPLORE YOU TO LET ME OUT OF THIS HOUSE AT ONCE SEND ME AWAY HOW YOU WILL AND WHERE YOU WILL SEND KEEPERS WITH ME WITH WHIPS AND CHAINS
AND THRUST LAST NIGHT'S WESTMINSTER GAZETTE INTO MY HAND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT HE ASKED AS HE STOOD BACK AND FOLDED HIS ARMS I LOOKED OVER THE PAPER FOR I REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
AND THAT LET ME TELL YOU IS MUCH IN THIS AGE SO SCEPTICAL AND SELFISH AND YOU SIR I HAVE READ ALL THE LETTERS TO POOR MISS LUCY AND SOME OF THEM SPEAK OF YOU SO I KNOW YOU SINCE SOME DAYS FROM THE KNOWING OF OTHERS
EVENING A LONG AND TRYING AND EXCITING DAY BY THE FIRST POST I GOT MY DIRECTED ENVELOPE WITH A DIRTY SCRAP OF PAPER ENCLOSED ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN WITH A CARPENTER'S PENCIL IN A SPRAWLING HAND SAM BLOXAM
THE OLD GENT GIVE THEM SHILLIN'S AN THEY SEEIN THEY GOT SO MUCH THEY WANTED MORE BUT E TOOK ONE OF THEM BY THE SHOULDER AND WAS LIKE TO THROW IM DOWN THE STEPS TILL THE LOT OF THEM WENT AWAY CUSSIN I THOUGHT THAT WITH THIS DESCRIPTION I COULD FIND THE HOUSE
AND WITH THIS SLENDER CLUE I HAD TO START FOR POPLAR IT WAS TWELVE O'CLOCK BEFORE I GOT ANY SATISFACTORY HINT OF SUCH A BUILDING AND THIS I GOT AT A COFFEE SHOP WHERE SOME WORKMEN WERE HAVING THEIR DINNER
DOCTOR VAN HELSING WILL YOU READ THIS AND TELL ME IF IT MUST GO IN IT IS MY RECORD OF TO DAY I TOO HAVE SEEN THE NEED OF PUTTING DOWN AT PRESENT EVERYTHING HOWEVER TRIVIAL BUT THERE IS LITTLE IN THIS EXCEPT WHAT IS PERSONAL MUST IT GO IN
ARE WE NOT PLEDGED TO DESTROY THIS MONSTER
WE RESUMED OUR PLACES AND DOCTOR VAN HELSING WENT ON WITH A SORT OF CHEERFULNESS WHICH SHOWED THAT THE SERIOUS WORK HAD BEGUN IT WAS TO BE TAKEN AS GRAVELY AND IN AS BUSINESSLIKE A WAY AS ANY OTHER TRANSACTION OF LIFE WELL
VAN HELSING TO MISSUS HARKER TWENTY FOUR SEPTEMBER CONFIDENCE DEAR MADAM I PRAY YOU TO PARDON MY WRITING IN THAT I AM SO FAR FRIEND AS THAT I SENT TO YOU SAD NEWS OF MISS LUCY WESTENRA'S DEATH
TELL ME I SAID I CAN HAZARD NO OPINION I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK AND I HAVE NO DATA ON WHICH TO FOUND A CONJECTURE
AND ON THE SOUTH THE NORTH AND WEST WERE SURELY NEVER MEANT TO BE LEFT OUT OF HIS DIABOLICAL SCHEME LET ALONE THE CITY ITSELF AND THE VERY HEART OF FASHIONABLE LONDON IN THE SOUTH WEST AND WEST
AND ESPECIAL WHEN HIS MIND IS DISTURBED
YOU GENTLEMEN WHO BY NATIONALITY BY HEREDITY
BUT IT IS BEST AS IT IS IT IS BETTER TO BE DISAPPOINTED AND WORRIED IN SUCH A WAY NOW THAN TO HAVE HER NERVE BROKEN THE DOCTORS WERE QUITE RIGHT TO INSIST ON HER BEING KEPT OUT OF THIS DREADFUL BUSINESS
AND UNSELFISH AND SPRING FROM THE HIGHEST SENSE OF DUTY COULD YOU LOOK SIR INTO MY HEART YOU WOULD APPROVE TO THE FULL THE SENTIMENTS WHICH ANIMATE ME NAY MORE YOU WOULD COUNT ME AMONGST THE BEST AND TRUEST OF YOUR FRIENDS
MADAM MINA IT IS ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEAD I COME SIR I SAID YOU COULD HAVE NO BETTER CLAIM ON ME THAN THAT YOU WERE A FRIEND AND HELPER OF LUCY WESTENRA AND I HELD OUT MY HAND
YET SO MOMENTOUS A WISH TO ENSURE ITS FULFILMENT HE LOOKED AT ME KEENLY AND SEEING THE NEGATIVE IN MY FACE TURNED TO THE OTHERS AND SCRUTINISED THEM CLOSELY NOT MEETING ANY SUFFICIENT RESPONSE HE WENT ON
I HAVE AN IDEA THAT VAN HELSING THINKS HE KNOWS TOO BUT HE WILL ONLY LET OUT ENOUGH AT A TIME TO WHET CURIOSITY HE WENT TO EXETER YESTERDAY AND STAYED THERE ALL NIGHT TO DAY HE CAME BACK AND ALMOST BOUNDED INTO THE ROOM AT ABOUT HALF PAST FIVE O'CLOCK
IF ONE COULD ONLY GET THEM IN PROPER ORDER HERE THEY ARE WILL NOT MENTION DRINKING FEARS THE THOUGHT OF BEING BURDENED WITH THE SOUL OF ANYTHING HAS NO DREAD OF WANTING LIFE IN THE FUTURE
WHO WON HIS NAME AGAINST THE TURK OVER THE GREAT RIVER ON THE VERY FRONTIER OF TURKEY LAND IF IT BE SO THEN WAS HE NO COMMON MAN FOR IN THAT TIME AND FOR CENTURIES AFTER HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS THE CLEVEREST AND THE MOST CUNNING
IF YOU WILL LET ME HAVE HIS LORDSHIP'S ADDRESS I WILL CONSULT THE HOUSE ON THE SUBJECT AND WILL IN ANY CASE COMMUNICATE WITH HIS LORDSHIP BY TO NIGHT'S POST IT WILL BE A PLEASURE IF WE CAN SO FAR DEVIATE FROM OUR RULES AS TO GIVE THE REQUIRED INFORMATION TO HIS LORDSHIP
I HOPE I DID RIGHT IN NOT SAYING ANYTHING OF IT TO MISSUS WESTENRA I SHOULD NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF IF ANY ACT OF MINE WERE IT EVEN A NEGATIVE ONE BROUGHT HARM ON POOR DEAR LUCY
I COULDN'T EAT THEM OR HE SUDDENLY STOPPED AND THE OLD CUNNING LOOK SPREAD OVER HIS FACE LIKE A WIND SWEEP ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER AND DOCTOR AS TO LIFE WHAT IS IT AFTER ALL WHEN YOU'VE GOT ALL YOU REQUIRE
WHEN SHE CAME BACK I ADDRESSED THE ENVELOPE AND STAMPED IT AND WHEN SMOLLET HAD AGAIN FAITHFULLY PROMISED TO POST THE ADDRESS WHEN FOUND I TOOK MY WAY TO HOME WE'RE ON THE TRACK ANYHOW I AM TIRED TO NIGHT
HE CAN FLOURISH WHEN THAT HE CAN FATTEN ON THE BLOOD OF THE LIVING EVEN MORE
HE LOOKED SO HOSTILE THAT I THOUGHT HE WAS IN FOR ANOTHER HOMICIDAL FIT SO I BLEW MY WHISTLE THE INSTANT HOWEVER THAT I DID SO HE BECAME CALM AND SAID APOLOGETICALLY FORGIVE ME DOCTOR I FORGOT MYSELF
I SHALL WRITE SO SOON AS EVER I CAN DOCTOR SEWARD'S DIARY TWENTY SIX SEPTEMBER TRULY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FINALITY
LETTER BY HAND VAN HELSING TO MISSUS HARKER TWENTY FIVE SEPTEMBER SIXTH O'CLOCK DEAR MADAM MINA I HAVE READ YOUR HUSBAND'S SO WONDERFUL DIARY YOU MAY SLEEP WITHOUT DOUBT STRANGE AND TERRIBLE AS IT IS IT IS TRUE
THE VERY PROSPECT OF BEER WHICH MY EXPECTED COMING HAD OPENED TO HIM HAD PROVED TOO MUCH
WELL HE SAID IT IS LIKE POOR LUCY'S AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT SIMPLY THAT THERE IS SOME CAUSE IN COMMON WHATEVER IT WAS THAT INJURED HER HAS INJURED THEM I DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND HIS ANSWER
THAT HIS VITAL FACULTIES GROW STRENUOUS AND SEEM AS THOUGH THEY REFRESH THEMSELVES WHEN HIS SPECIAL PABULUM IS PLENTY BUT HE CANNOT FLOURISH WITHOUT THIS DIET HE EAT NOT AS OTHERS EVEN FRIEND JONATHAN WHO LIVED WITH HIM FOR WEEKS
STRENGTH BEING THE BEST SAFETY THROUGH CARE OF ME BUT THEIR MINDS WERE MADE UP AND THOUGH IT WAS A BITTER PILL FOR ME TO SWALLOW I COULD SAY NOTHING SAVE TO ACCEPT THEIR CHIVALROUS CARE OF ME MISTER MORRIS RESUMED THE DISCUSSION AS THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE
AND THE AUTUMN NIGHT WAS CLOSING IN SO I DID NOT LOSE ANY TIME HAVING LEARNED THE ADDRESS OF MITCHELL SONS AND CANDY FROM A DIRECTORY AT THE BERKELEY I WAS SOON AT THEIR OFFICE IN SACKVILLE STREET THE GENTLEMAN WHO SAW ME WAS PARTICULARLY SUAVE IN MANNER
SO I PRAY YOU IF IT MAY BE ENLIGHTEN HIM NOT LEST IT MAY HARM AGAIN YOUR PARDON AND FORGIVE ME VAN HELSING TELEGRAM MISSUS HARKER TO VAN HELSING
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CRIED HE THREW HIMSELF WITH A DESPAIRING GESTURE INTO A CHAIR AND PLACED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS AS HE SPOKE
IF WE FIND THEM ALL IN THAT HOUSE THEN OUR WORK IS NEAR THE END BUT IF THERE BE SOME MISSING WE MUST SEARCH UNTIL WE FIND THEM THEN SHALL WE MAKE OUR FINAL COUP AND HUNT THE WRETCH TO HIS REAL DEATH
SO AFTER DINNER FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE MUSIC TO SAVE APPEARANCES EVEN AMONGST OURSELVES I TOOK MINA TO HER ROOM AND LEFT HER TO GO TO BED
SHALL BE FOR YOU AND THOSE YOU LOVE
WITCH ORDOG AND POKOL' SATAN AND HELL AND IN ONE MANUSCRIPT THIS VERY DRACULA IS SPOKEN OF AS
ALL RIGHT I'LL GO NOW AND I ASKED THE OTHERS TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES FOR ME AS I HAD TO GO AND SEE MY PATIENT TAKE ME WITH YOU FRIEND JOHN SAID THE PROFESSOR HIS CASE IN YOUR DIARY INTEREST ME MUCH AND IT HAD BEARING TOO NOW AND AGAIN ON OUR CASE
HE WAS SULKY AND SO I CAME AWAY LATER IN THE DAY HE SENT FOR ME ORDINARILY I WOULD NOT HAVE COME WITHOUT SPECIAL REASON BUT JUST AT PRESENT I AM SO INTERESTED IN HIM THAT I WOULD GLADLY MAKE AN EFFORT
BUT NONE OF THE OTHERS AT FIRST SAID ANYTHING HIS REQUEST WAS THAT I WOULD AT ONCE RELEASE HIM FROM THE ASYLUM AND SEND HIM HOME THIS HE BACKED UP WITH ARGUMENTS REGARDING HIS COMPLETE RECOVERY
I AM CONTENT TO IMPLORE IN SUCH A CASE NOT ON PERSONAL GROUNDS
SHE SOMETIMES KEPT A DIARY YOU NEED NOT LOOK SURPRISED MADAM MINA IT WAS BEGUN AFTER YOU HAD LEFT AND WAS IN IMITATION OF YOU AND IN THAT DIARY
BUT I SHALL GET THE BUNDLE OF PAPERS YOU CAN TAKE THEM WITH YOU AND READ THEM IN THE TRAIN AFTER BREAKFAST I SAW HIM TO THE STATION WHEN WE WERE PARTING HE SAID
SINCE YOU SEEK TO IMPRESS US WITH YOUR COMPLETE REASONABLENESS YOU DO THIS WHOSE SANITY WE HAVE REASON TO DOUBT
UNDER AUSPICES PLEASANTER TO YOURSELF TO WHICH TO MY ASTONISHMENT HE REPLIED GOOD BYE MY DEAR I PRAY GOD I MAY NEVER SEE YOUR SWEET FACE AGAIN MAY HE BLESS AND KEEP YOU
AS WITH SUCH A FEELING AS THIS OUR GROWING KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE TORTURE TO HER I COULD NOT TELL THE OTHERS OF THE DAY'S DISCOVERY TILL WE WERE ALONE
FOR WHEN WE GET THE INFORMATION WHICH WE SEEK THERE WILL BE NO TIME TO LOSE WE MUST STERILISE ALL THE IMPORTED EARTH BETWEEN SUNRISE AND SUNSET WE SHALL THUS CATCH THE COUNT AT HIS WEAKEST AND WITHOUT A REFUGE TO FLY TO
FAR BE IT FROM ME TO ARROGATE TO MYSELF THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE DEITY I AM NOT EVEN CONCERNED IN HIS ESPECIALLY SPIRITUAL DOINGS IF I MAY STATE MY INTELLECTUAL POSITION I AM SO FAR AS CONCERNS THINGS PURELY TERRESTRIAL
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNDERGOING SOME PROCESS OF MENTAL DISTURBANCE AND KNOWING HOW HIS PAST MOODS HAD INTERPRETED THINGS SEEMINGLY FOREIGN TO HIMSELF I THOUGHT I WOULD ENTER INTO HIS MIND AS WELL AS I COULD AND GO WITH HIM
A NEW COLD STORAGE BUILDING AND AS THIS SUITED THE CONDITION OF A NEW FANGLED WARE'US I AT ONCE DROVE TO IT AN INTERVIEW WITH A SURLY GATEKEEPER AND A SURLIER FOREMAN
THAT YOU HARDLY APPREHEND MY WISH I DESIRE TO GO AT ONCE HERE NOW THIS VERY HOUR THIS VERY MOMENT IF I MAY TIME PRESSES
TO KNOW IF I WOULD SEE HIM AT ONCE AS HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO SAY TO ME I TOLD THE MESSENGER TO SAY THAT I WOULD ATTEND TO HIS WISHES IN THE MORNING I WAS BUSY JUST AT THE MOMENT THE ATTENDANT ADDED HE SEEMS VERY IMPORTUNATE SIR I HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM SO EAGER
SHE CAME AT ONCE AFTER SAYING PLEASANTLY TO MISTER RENFIELD GOOD BYE
AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU WILL NEVER WANT THAT IS ALL I HAVE FRIENDS GOOD FRIENDS LIKE YOU DOCTOR SEWARD THIS WAS SAID WITH A LEER OF INEXPRESSIBLE CUNNING I KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVER LACK THE MEANS OF LIFE
AND I TOOK CARE TO STAND WHERE I COULD SEIZE HIM AT ONCE IF HE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A SPRING AT HER SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM WITH AN EASY GRACEFULNESS WHICH WOULD AT ONCE COMMAND THE RESPECT OF ANY LUNATIC FOR EASINESS IS ONE OF THE QUALITIES MAD PEOPLE MOST RESPECT
BE REALLY IN LONDON I FEAR TO THINK
THAN IN BEING HERE AMONGST US AND IN IGNORANCE I ONLY SAW DOCTOR SEWARD FOR A MOMENT AND TOLD HIM WHERE I WAS OFF TO PROMISING TO COME BACK AND TELL THE REST SO SOON AS I SHOULD HAVE FOUND OUT ANYTHING
HE TOOK ME BY THE SHOULDER AND TURNED MY FACE ROUND TO THE LIGHT AND SAID AFTER A SHARP SCRUTINY BUT MADAM MINA TOLD ME YOU WERE ILL THAT YOU HAD HAD A SHOCK
THAT THE HOUSE WHICH DRACULA HAD BOUGHT WAS THE VERY NEXT ONE TO MY OWN HE WAS AMAZED AND A GREAT CONCERN SEEMED TO COME ON HIM OH THAT WE HAD KNOWN IT BEFORE HE SAID FOR THEN WE MIGHT HAVE REACHED HIM IN TIME TO SAVE POOR LUCY HOWEVER
AND NOT THINK ME FOOLISH THAT I HAVE EVEN HALF BELIEVED SOME VERY STRANGE THINGS HE REASSURED ME BY HIS MANNER AS WELL AS HIS WORDS WHEN HE SAID OH MY DEAR IF YOU ONLY KNOW HOW STRANGE IS THE MATTER REGARDING WHICH I AM HERE
BUT HE WOULD NOT ATTEND HE WENT ON WITH HIS SINGING JUST AS THOUGH WE HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT HE HAD GOT A SCRAP OF PAPER AND WAS FOLDING IT INTO A NOTE BOOK WE HAD TO COME AWAY AS IGNORANT AS WE WENT IN
AND SO DETERMINED TO LET HIM GO ON A LITTLE LONGER KNOWING FROM EXPERIENCE THAT HE WOULD LIKE ALL LUNATICS GIVE HIMSELF AWAY IN THE END VAN HELSING WAS GAZING AT HIM WITH A LOOK OF UTMOST INTENSITY HIS BUSHY EYEBROWS ALMOST MEETING WITH THE FIXED CONCENTRATION OF HIS LOOK
HARKER IS OUT FOLLOWING UP CLUES AND SO ARE LORD GODALMING AND QUINCEY VAN HELSING SITS IN MY STUDY PORING OVER THE RECORD PREPARED BY THE HARKERS
I AM PUZZLED AFRESH ABOUT RENFIELD HIS MOODS CHANGE SO RAPIDLY THAT I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP TOUCH OF THEM AND AS THEY ALWAYS MEAN SOMETHING MORE THAN HIS OWN WELL BEING THEY FORM A MORE THAN INTERESTING STUDY
AMONGST THE MOUNTAINS OVER LAKE HERMANSTADT WHERE THE DEVIL CLAIMS THE TENTH SCHOLAR AS HIS DUE IN THE RECORDS ARE SUCH WORDS AS
SHE WALKED OVER TO HIM SMILING PLEASANTLY AND HELD OUT HER HAND GOOD EVENING MISTER RENFIELD SAID SHE YOU SEE I KNOW YOU FOR DOCTOR SEWARD HAS TOLD ME OF YOU HE MADE NO IMMEDIATE REPLY BUT EYED HER ALL OVER INTENTLY WITH A SET FROWN ON HIS FACE
YOU WILL PARDON PRAISE FROM AN OLD MAN BUT YOU ARE BLESSED IN YOUR WIFE I WOULD LISTEN TO HIM GO ON PRAISING MINA FOR A DAY SO I SIMPLY NODDED AND STOOD SILENT
WE HAVE PROOF BY INFERENCE THUS WHEREAS HE CAN DO AS HE WILL WITHIN HIS LIMIT WHEN HE HAVE HIS EARTH HOME HIS COFFIN HOME HIS HELL HOME THE PLACE UNHALLOWED AS WE SAW WHEN HE WENT TO THE GRAVE OF THE SUICIDE AT WHITBY STILL
I WONDER I SAID REFLECTIVELY WHAT AN ELEPHANT'S SOUL IS LIKE THE EFFECT I DESIRED WAS OBTAINED FOR HE AT ONCE FELL FROM HIS HIGH HORSE AND BECAME A CHILD AGAIN I DON'T WANT AN ELEPHANT'S SOUL OR ANY SOUL AT ALL HE SAID
A MAN OF MEDIUM WEIGHT STRONGLY BUILT WITH HIS SHOULDERS SET BACK OVER A BROAD DEEP CHEST AND A NECK WELL BALANCED ON THE TRUNK
THE ORIGINAL VENDORS ARE THE EXECUTORS OF THE LATE MISTER ARCHIBALD WINTER SUFFIELD THE PURCHASER IS A FOREIGN NOBLEMAN COUNT DE VILLE WHO EFFECTED THE PURCHASE HIMSELF PAYING THE PURCHASE MONEY IN NOTES OVER THE COUNTER
DO I READ YOUR LESSON ARIGHT AH YOU ARE MY FAVOURITE PUPIL STILL IT IS WORTH TO TEACH YOU NOW THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE TAKEN THE FIRST STEP TO UNDERSTAND
WHO HAD SLEPT OFF THE REMAINS OF HIS BEER ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AT CORCORAN'S HAD LEFT FOR HIS WORK AT POPLAR AT FIVE O'CLOCK THAT MORNING HE COULD NOT TELL ME WHERE THE PLACE OF WORK WAS SITUATED BUT HE HAD A VAGUE IDEA THAT IT WAS SOME KIND OF A NEW FANGLED WARE'US
IS ALL THAT FEVER GONE AND IS HE STRONG AND HEARTY I SAW HERE AN OPENING TO ASK HIM ABOUT JONATHAN SO I SAID HE WAS ALMOST RECOVERED BUT HE HAS BEEN GREATLY UPSET
I NEVER EARD OF IM IN ALL MY BLOOMIN DAYS DON'T BELIEVE THERE AIN'T NOBODY OF THAT KIND LIVIN ERE OR ANYWHERES I TOOK OUT SMOLLET'S LETTER AND AS I READ IT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE LESSON OF THE SPELLING OF THE NAME OF THE COURT MIGHT GUIDE ME WHAT ARE YOU
OH MADAM MINA GOOD WOMEN TELL ALL THEIR LIVES AND BY DAY AND BY HOUR AND BY MINUTE SUCH THINGS THAT ANGELS CAN READ AND WE MEN WHO WISH TO KNOW HAVE IN US SOMETHING OF ANGELS EYES
WE HAVE ALL WE MAY ACT UPON AND LET ME TELL YOU THAT VERY MUCH OF THE BELIEFS ARE JUSTIFIED BY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR OWN SO UNHAPPY EXPERIENCE THE VAMPIRE LIVE ON AND CANNOT DIE BY MERE PASSING OF THE TIME
NAY HAD I EVEN GUESS AT HIM ONE SO PRECIOUS LIFE HAD BEEN SPARED TO MANY OF US WHO DID LOVE HER BUT THAT IS GONE AND WE MUST SO WORK THAT OTHER POOR SOULS PERISH NOT WHILST WE CAN SAVE THE NOSFERATU DO NOT DIE LIKE THE BEE WHEN HE STING ONCE
KORKRANS FOUR POTERS CORT BARTEL STREET WALWORTH ARSK FOR THE DEPITE I GOT THE LETTER IN BED AND ROSE WITHOUT WAKING MINA SHE LOOKED HEAVY AND SLEEPY AND PALE AND FAR FROM WELL
NOT KNOW YOU I WHO AM OLD AND WHO HAVE STUDIED ALL MY LIFE MEN AND WOMEN I WHO HAVE MADE MY SPECIALTY THE BRAIN AND ALL THAT BELONGS TO HIM AND ALL THAT FOLLOW FROM HIM
AND HER SO FINE HUSBAND AND ARTHUR AND MY FRIEND QUINCEY THEY ARE WITH YOU TOO GOOD AS I DROVE TO THE HOUSE I TOLD HIM OF WHAT HAD PASSED AND OF HOW MY OWN DIARY HAD COME TO BE OF SOME USE THROUGH MISSUS HARKER'S SUGGESTION AT WHICH THE PROFESSOR INTERRUPTED ME
WHY WE KNOW NOT HE MAY NOT ENTER ANYWHERE AT THE FIRST UNLESS THERE BE SOME ONE OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHO BID HIM TO COME THOUGH AFTERWARDS HE CAN COME AS HE PLEASE HIS POWER CEASES AS DOES THAT OF ALL EVIL THINGS AT THE COMING OF THE DAY
AND SO NOW WE SHALL NOT SPEAK OF IT LEST IT DISTRESS I SHALL STAY IN EXETER TO NIGHT FOR I WANT TO THINK MUCH OVER WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME AND WHEN I HAVE THOUGHT I WILL ASK YOU QUESTIONS IF I MAY AND THEN TOO
THOUGH NOW AND AGAIN WERE SCIONS WHO WERE HELD BY THEIR COEVALS TO HAVE HAD DEALINGS WITH THE EVIL ONE
POOR DEAR HOW HE MUST HAVE SUFFERED WHETHER IT BE TRUE OR ONLY IMAGINATION I WONDER IF THERE IS ANY TRUTH IN IT AT ALL DID HE GET HIS BRAIN FEVER AND THEN WRITE ALL THOSE TERRIBLE THINGS
AND AS IT WOULD BE AT LEAST ADVISABLE TO WAIT TILL LORD GODALMING SHOULD HEAR FROM MITCHELL'S WE DECIDED NOT TO TAKE ANY ACTIVE STEP BEFORE BREAKFAST TIME FOR A GOOD WHILE WE SAT AND SMOKED DISCUSSING THE MATTER IN ITS VARIOUS LIGHTS AND BEARINGS
I THOUGHT I WOULD PUSH HIS ANALOGY TO ITS UTMOST LOGICALLY SO I SAID QUICKLY OH IT IS A SOUL YOU ARE AFTER NOW IS IT HIS MADNESS FOILED HIS REASON AND A PUZZLED LOOK SPREAD OVER HIS FACE AS
I PLACED A MAN IN THE CORRIDOR LAST NIGHT AND TOLD HIM TO MAKE AN ACCURATE NOTE OF ANY SOUND HE MIGHT HEAR FROM RENFIELD'S ROOM AND GAVE HIM INSTRUCTIONS THAT IF THERE SHOULD BE ANYTHING STRANGE HE WAS TO CALL ME
HIS IS A CURIOUS CASE INDEED WE MUST WATCH HIM TO NIGHT LETTER MITCHELL SONS AND CANDY TO LORD GODALMING
I WILL PLEDGE MY LIFE ON IT IT MAY BE WORSE FOR OTHERS BUT FOR HIM AND YOU THERE IS NO DREAD HE IS A NOBLE FELLOW AND LET ME TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE OF MEN THAT ONE WHO WOULD DO AS HE DID IN GOING DOWN THAT WALL AND TO THAT ROOM AY AND GOING A SECOND TIME
TO MAKE HIS LIFE STRONG AND MANLY AND YOUR LIFE A HAPPY ONE NOW YOU MUST EAT YOU ARE OVERWROUGHT AND PERHAPS OVER ANXIOUS HUSBAND JONATHAN WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE YOU SO PALE
SOMEWHAT IN THE POSITION WHICH ENOCH OCCUPIED SPIRITUALLY THIS WAS A POSER TO ME I COULD NOT AT THE MOMENT RECALL ENOCH'S APPOSITENESS SO I HAD TO ASK A SIMPLE QUESTION
AS MADAM MINA SAW HIM ON THE WINDOW AT WHITBY AND AS FRIEND JOHN SAW HIM FLY FROM THIS SO NEAR HOUSE AND AS MY FRIEND QUINCEY SAW HIM
THE MEN ALL JUMPED TO THEIR FEET LORD GODALMING FLEW OVER TO THE WINDOW AND THREW UP THE SASH AS HE DID SO WE HEARD MISTER MORRIS'S VOICE WITHOUT SORRY
THIS DID NOT AT ALL SATISFY HIM FOR HE SAID QUICKLY
I ASKED I'M THE DEPITY HE ANSWERED I SAW AT ONCE THAT I WAS ON THE RIGHT TRACK PHONETIC SPELLING HAD AGAIN MISLED ME A HALF CROWN TIP PUT THE DEPUTY'S KNOWLEDGE AT MY DISPOSAL AND I LEARNED THAT MISTER BLOXAM
SUCH FOR INSTANCE AS WHEN HE WANTED A CAT
WITHOUT HEART OR CONSCIENCE PREYING ON THE BODIES AND THE SOULS OF THOSE WE LOVE BEST TO US FOR EVER ARE THE GATES OF HEAVEN SHUT FOR WHO SHALL OPEN THEM TO US AGAIN WE GO ON FOR ALL TIME ABHORRED BY ALL A BLOT ON THE FACE OF GOD'S SUNSHINE
I WANT TO THINK AND I CANNOT THINK FREELY WHEN MY BODY IS CONFINED I AM SURE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND HE HAD EVIDENTLY SELF CONTROL SO WHEN THE ATTENDANTS CAME I TOLD THEM NOT TO MIND AND THEY WITHDREW
I WANT TO SEE YOUR PATIENT MISTER RENFIELD DO LET ME SEE HIM WHAT YOU HAVE SAID OF HIM IN YOUR DIARY INTERESTS ME SO MUCH SHE LOOKED SO APPEALING AND SO PRETTY THAT I COULD NOT REFUSE HER AND THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE REASON WHY I SHOULD SO I TOOK HER WITH ME
AND WHEN WE HAD SUPPED SHE TOLD ME OF VAN HELSING'S VISIT AND OF HER HAVING GIVEN HIM THE TWO DIARIES COPIED OUT AND OF HOW ANXIOUS SHE HAS BEEN ABOUT ME SHE SHOWED ME IN THE DOCTOR'S LETTER THAT ALL I WROTE DOWN WAS TRUE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE A NEW MAN OF ME
WHAT SAY YOU WHILST HE WAS SPEAKING JONATHAN HAD TAKEN MY HAND I FEARED OH SO MUCH THAT THE APPALLING NATURE OF OUR DANGER WAS OVERCOMING HIM
I SOMETIMES THINK WE MUST BE ALL MAD AND THAT WE SHALL WAKE TO SANITY IN STRAIT WAISTCOATS LATER WE HAVE MET AGAIN WE SEEM AT LAST TO BE ON THE TRACK AND OUR WORK OF TO MORROW MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF THE END
IF NOT MORE STERN AND MOTIONED TO HIM THAT HIS EFFORTS WERE UNAVAILING I HAD PREVIOUSLY SEEN SOMETHING OF THE SAME CONSTANTLY GROWING EXCITEMENT IN HIM WHEN HE HAD TO MAKE SOME REQUEST OF WHICH AT THE TIME
HE IS ONLY STRONGER AND BEING STRONGER HAVE YET MORE POWER TO WORK EVIL
BUT I DO MIND HE ANSWERED THE AFFAIRS OF THEIR CLIENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY SAFE IN THE HANDS OF MITCHELL SONS AND CANDY THIS WAS MANIFESTLY A PRIG OF THE FIRST WATER AND THERE WAS NO USE ARGUING WITH HIM
NO MATTER HOW LOW IN THE SCALE OF CREATION ONE MIGHT INDEFINITELY PROLONG LIFE
AND HELD UP HIS HANDS WRINGING THEM IN PLAINTIVE SUPPLICATION AND POURED FORTH A TORRENT OF ENTREATY
AGAIN HE LOOKED AT US ALL KEENLY I HAD A GROWING CONVICTION THAT THIS SUDDEN CHANGE OF HIS ENTIRE INTELLECTUAL METHOD
THAT SEEM TO BROADEN AS THE BIG BUSHY BROWS COME DOWN AND THE MOUTH TIGHTENS THE FOREHEAD IS BROAD AND FINE RISING AT FIRST ALMOST STRAIGHT AND THEN SLOPING BACK ABOVE TWO BUMPS OR RIDGES WIDE APART
SO I HANDED HIM THE SHORTHAND DIARY HE TOOK IT WITH A GRATEFUL BOW AND SAID MAY I READ IT IF YOU WISH I ANSWERED AS DEMURELY AS I COULD HE OPENED IT AND FOR AN INSTANT HIS FACE FELL THEN HE STOOD UP AND BOWED
THERE WAS FIVE IN THE FIRST LOAD AN FOUR IN THE SECOND IT WAS MAIN DRY WORK AN I DON'T SO WELL REMEMBER OW I GOT OME I INTERRUPTED HIM WERE THE BOXES LEFT IN THE HALL
MY LORD WE ARE AT ALL TIMES ONLY TOO HAPPY TO MEET YOUR WISHES WE BEG WITH REGARD TO THE DESIRE OF YOUR LORDSHIP EXPRESSED BY MISTER HARKER ON YOUR BEHALF
HE CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS YET HE IS NOT FREE NAY HE IS EVEN MORE PRISONER THAN THE SLAVE OF THE GALLEY THAN THE MADMAN IN HIS CELL HE CANNOT GO WHERE HE LISTS HE WHO IS NOT OF NATURE
AND THAT SUCH A THING IS HERE IN LONDON IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HE WAVED HIS HAND FOR SILENCE AND WENT ON
THE HOUSE LOOKED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN LONG UNTENANTED THE WINDOWS WERE ENCRUSTED WITH DUST AND THE SHUTTERS WERE UP ALL THE FRAMEWORK WAS BLACK WITH TIME AND FROM THE IRON THE PAINT HAD MOSTLY SCALED AWAY
AS HE ANSWERED ME THE FLY MY DEAR SIR HAS ONE STRIKING FEATURE ITS WINGS ARE TYPICAL OF THE AERIAL POWERS OF THE PSYCHIC FACULTIES THE ANCIENTS DID WELL WHEN THEY TYPIFIED THE SOUL AS A BUTTERFLY
LET ME ILLUSTRATE I HEARD ONCE OF AN AMERICAN WHO SO DEFINED FAITH THAT FACULTY WHICH ENABLES US TO BELIEVE THINGS WHICH WE KNOW TO BE UNTRUE FOR ONE I FOLLOW THAT MAN
HE SAID TO ME MISSUS HARKER IS IT NOT I BOWED ASSENT THAT WAS MISS MINA MURRAY AGAIN I ASSENTED IT IS MINA MURRAY THAT I CAME TO SEE THAT WAS FRIEND OF THAT POOR DEAR CHILD LUCY WESTENRA
YOU HAVE I SAID FRANKLY BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS I FELT BRUTALLY THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE PAUSE AND THEN HE SAID SLOWLY THEN I SUPPOSE I MUST ONLY SHIFT MY GROUND OF REQUEST LET ME ASK FOR THIS CONCESSION BOON
AN ARROW IN THE SIDE OF HIM WHO DIED FOR MAN BUT WE ARE FACE TO FACE WITH DUTY
AND WE ARE IN GREAT HOPES THAT HIS CLUE MAY BE AN IMPORTANT ONE BEFORE GOING TO BED I WENT ROUND TO THE PATIENT'S ROOM AND LOOKED IN THROUGH THE OBSERVATION TRAP
OH VERY WELL HE SAID LET HER COME IN BY ALL MEANS BUT JUST WAIT A MINUTE TILL I TIDY UP THE PLACE HIS METHOD OF TIDYING WAS PECULIAR HE SIMPLY SWALLOWED ALL THE FLIES AND SPIDERS IN THE BOXES BEFORE I COULD STOP HIM IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT HE FEARED
THOUGH I FELT THAT BY SO DOING I WAS LOWERING MYSELF IN THE EYES OF THE LUNATIC AND WHY WITH ENOCH BECAUSE HE WALKED WITH GOD I COULD NOT SEE THE ANALOGY BUT DID NOT LIKE TO ADMIT IT
ONLY AT CERTAIN TIMES CAN HE HAVE LIMITED FREEDOM IF HE BE NOT AT THE PLACE WHITHER HE IS BOUND HE CAN ONLY CHANGE HIMSELF AT NOON
SO I THANKED HIM GAVE THE ADDRESS AT DOCTOR SEWARD'S AND CAME AWAY IT WAS NOW DARK AND I WAS TIRED AND HUNGRY I GOT A CUP OF TEA AT THE AERATED BREAD COMPANY AND CAME DOWN TO PURFLEET BY THE NEXT TRAIN
MINA IS FAST ASLEEP AND LOOKS A LITTLE TOO PALE HER EYES LOOK AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN CRYING POOR DEAR I'VE NO DOUBT IT FRETS HER TO BE KEPT IN THE DARK AND IT MAY MAKE HER DOUBLY ANXIOUS ABOUT ME AND THE OTHERS
BUT I HAVE SEEN YOUR TRUE SELF SINCE LAST NIGHT YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR HAND WILL YOU NOT AND LET US BE FRIENDS FOR ALL OUR LIVES WE SHOOK HANDS AND HE WAS SO EARNEST AND SO KIND THAT IT MADE ME QUITE CHOKY
WHICH HAD BEEN AT SIX O'CLOCK WE UNCONSCIOUSLY FORMED A SORT OF BOARD OR COMMITTEE PROFESSOR VAN HELSING TOOK THE HEAD OF THE TABLE TO WHICH DOCTOR SEWARD MOTIONED HIM AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM HE MADE ME SIT NEXT TO HIM ON HIS RIGHT AND ASKED ME TO ACT AS SECRETARY JONATHAN SAT NEXT TO ME
AS WIZARDS THERE ARE ALWAYS MYSTERIES IN LIFE
AND NOW TELL ME ALL ABOUT HIM WHEN IT CAME TO SPEAKING TO THIS GREAT LEARNED MAN I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT HE WOULD THINK ME A WEAK FOOL AND JONATHAN A MADMAN
AND I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT IF I COULD FIND THE FORMER OWNER THERE MIGHT BE SOME MEANS DISCOVERED OF GAINING ACCESS TO THE HOUSE THERE WAS AT PRESENT NOTHING TO BE LEARNED FROM THE PICCADILLY SIDE AND NOTHING COULD BE DONE
YOUR HUSBAND IS NOBLE NATURE AND YOU ARE NOBLE TOO FOR YOU TRUST AND TRUST CANNOT BE WHERE THERE IS MEAN NATURE AND YOUR HUSBAND TELL ME OF HIM IS HE QUITE WELL
IS AS SUNSHINE IT OPENS THE GATE TO ME
SO AS WE ALL TOOK HANDS OUR SOLEMN COMPACT WAS MADE I FELT MY HEART ICY COLD
I SEE I SAID YOU WANT BIG THINGS THAT YOU CAN MAKE YOUR TEETH MEET IN HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BREAKFAST ON ELEPHANT WHAT RIDICULOUS NONSENSE YOU ARE TALKING HE WAS GETTING TOO WIDE AWAKE SO I THOUGHT I WOULD PRESS HIM HARD
HE THOUGHT HE SAW SOME ONE WHO RECALLED SOMETHING TERRIBLE SOMETHING WHICH LED TO HIS BRAIN FEVER AND HERE THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO OVERWHELM ME IN A RUSH THE PITY FOR JONATHAN THE HORROR WHICH HE EXPERIENCED THE WHOLE FEARFUL MYSTERY OF HIS DIARY
BUT THE FACT IS THAT WHILST THE PROFESSOR WAS TALKING THERE CAME A BIG BAT AND SAT ON THE WINDOW SILL I HAVE GOT SUCH A HORROR OF THE DAMNED BRUTES FROM RECENT EVENTS THAT I CANNOT STAND THEM AND I WENT OUT TO HAVE A SHOT
THAT MAY BE MORE GREAT THAN YOU CAN KNOW MAY IT BE THAT I SEE YOU YOU CAN TRUST ME I AM FRIEND OF DOCTOR JOHN SEWARD AND OF LORD GODALMING THAT WAS ARTHUR OF MISS LUCY I MUST KEEP IT PRIVATE FOR THE PRESENT FROM ALL
AND OH I AM REJOICED THAT HE IS NOT NOW WEIGHED DOWN WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HIS NEW POSITION I KNEW HE WOULD BE TRUE TO HIMSELF AND NOW HOW PROUD I AM TO SEE MY JONATHAN RISING TO THE HEIGHT OF HIS ADVANCEMENT
HE CAN TRANSFORM HIMSELF TO WOLF AS WE GATHER FROM THE SHIP ARRIVAL IN WHITBY WHEN HE TEAR OPEN THE DOG
THAT HE APPEARED TO BE IMPROVING VERY RAPIDLY THAT I WOULD HAVE A LONGER CHAT WITH HIM IN THE MORNING
HIS MUSIC AND HIS LOVE LIE FAR BEHIND YOU OTHERS ARE YOUNG SOME HAVE SEEN SORROW
I SUPPOSE NOW YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN CORPOREAL TRANSFERENCE NO NOR IN MATERIALISATION NO NOR IN ASTRAL BODIES NO
HE SAID CHEERFULLY LET THE LADY COME IN AND SAT DOWN ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED WITH HIS HEAD DOWN
WE KEEP HIM AND WE VALUE HIM BUT ALL THE SAME WE MUST NOT LET HIM THINK HIMSELF ALL THE TRUTH IN THE UNIVERSE THEN YOU WANT ME NOT TO LET SOME PREVIOUS CONVICTION
BUT UNCOMMUNICATIVE IN EQUAL PROPORTION HAVING ONCE TOLD ME THAT THE PICCADILLY HOUSE WHICH THROUGHOUT OUR INTERVIEW HE CALLED A MANSION WAS SOLD HE CONSIDERED MY BUSINESS AS CONCLUDED WHEN I ASKED WHO HAD PURCHASED IT
I LEFT THE BOYS BEHIND ME POOR ART SEEMED MORE CHEERFUL THAN HE HAS BEEN SINCE LUCY FIRST TOOK ILL AND QUINCEY IS MORE LIKE HIS OWN BRIGHT SELF THAN HE HAS BEEN FOR MANY A LONG DAY
AND YET CLOUDS ROLL IN BEHIND THE LIGHT EVERY TIME BUT THAT YOU DO NOT CANNOT COMPREHEND OH BUT I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU YOU SO CLEVER WOMAN MADAM HE SAID THIS VERY SOLEMNLY
HE REMEMBERED ALL ABOUT THE INCIDENT OF THE BOXES AND FROM A WONDERFUL DOG'S EARED NOTEBOOK WHICH HE PRODUCED FROM SOME MYSTERIOUS RECEPTACLE ABOUT THE SEAT OF HIS TROUSERS AND WHICH HAD HIEROGLYPHICAL ENTRIES IN THICK HALF OBLITERATED PENCIL
WITH A LAUGH HE REPLIED NOT MUCH FLIES ARE POOR THINGS AFTER ALL AFTER A PAUSE HE ADDED BUT I DON'T WANT THEIR SOULS BUZZING ROUND ME ALL THE SAME OR SPIDERS I WENT ON BLOW SPIDERS WHAT'S THE USE OF SPIDERS
THANK GOD THIS WILL BE THE LAST NIGHT OF HER LOOKING ON AT OUR CONFERENCES AND FEELING THE STING OF OUR NOT SHOWING OUR CONFIDENCE IT TOOK ALL MY COURAGE TO HOLD TO THE WISE RESOLUTION OF KEEPING HER OUT OF OUR GRIM TASK
RENFIELD MIGHT NOT SPEAK SO FREELY BEFORE A THIRD PERSON AS WHEN HE AND I WERE ALONE
AND WHAT HE LIKE NOT WHERE HE LOVE IS NOT TO HIS GOOD THEREFORE FOR HIS SAKE YOU MUST EAT AND SMILE
AS IF A WOMAN CAN SLEEP WHEN THOSE SHE LOVES ARE IN DANGER I SHALL LIE DOWN AND PRETEND TO SLEEP LEST JONATHAN HAVE ADDED ANXIETY ABOUT ME WHEN HE RETURNS DOCTOR SEWARD'S DIARY
AND CAN TAKE OUR MEASURE ACCORDING THERE ARE SUCH BEINGS AS VAMPIRES SOME OF US HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THEY EXIST EVEN HAD WE NOT THE PROOF OF OUR OWN UNHAPPY EXPERIENCE THE TEACHINGS AND THE RECORDS OF THE PAST GIVE PROOF ENOUGH FOR SANE PEOPLES I ADMIT
AT OTHER TIME HE CAN ONLY CHANGE WHEN THE TIME COME IT IS SAID TOO THAT HE CAN ONLY PASS RUNNING WATER AT THE SLACK OR THE FLOOD OF THE TIDE THEN THERE ARE THINGS WHICH SO AFFLICT HIM THAT HE HAS NO POWER AS THE GARLIC THAT WE KNOW OF AND AS FOR THINGS SACRED AS THIS SYMBOL MY CRUCIFIX
IN THIS INSTANCE I AM NOT PROMPTED BY CURIOSITY I ACT ON THE PART OF LORD GODALMING WHO WISHES TO KNOW SOMETHING OF THE PROPERTY WHICH WAS HE UNDERSTOOD LATELY FOR SALE THESE WORDS PUT A DIFFERENT COMPLEXION ON AFFAIRS
IF YOUR LORDSHIP WILL PARDON US USING SO VULGAR AN EXPRESSION BEYOND THIS WE KNOW NOTHING WHATEVER OF HIM WE ARE MY LORD YOUR LORDSHIP'S HUMBLE SERVANTS MITCHELL SONS AND CANDY DOCTOR SEWARD'S DIARY
EVEN IF SHE BE NOT HARMED HER HEART MAY FAIL HER IN SO MUCH AND SO MANY HORRORS AND HEREAFTER SHE MAY SUFFER
BY THIS TIME MY LITTLE JOKE WAS OVER AND I WAS ALMOST ASHAMED SO I TOOK THE TYPEWRITTEN COPY FROM MY WORKBASKET AND HANDED IT TO HIM FORGIVE ME I SAID I COULD NOT HELP IT BUT
FOR THE SAKE OF THE ALMIGHTY TAKE ME OUT OF THIS AND SAVE MY SOUL FROM GUILT CAN'T YOU HEAR ME MAN CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND WILL YOU NEVER LEARN DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I AM SANE AND EARNEST NOW THAT I AM NO LUNATIC IN A MAD FIT BUT A SANE MAN FIGHTING FOR HIS SOUL
AND SIMPLY READ IT OFF TO THEM AS THE BEST MEANS OF LETTING THEM GET ABREAST OF MY OWN INFORMATION WHEN I HAD FINISHED VAN HELSING SAID THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT DAY'S WORK FRIEND JONATHAN DOUBTLESS WE ARE ON THE TRACK OF THE MISSING BOXES
HE TOOK IT AND SAID TENDERLY OH MADAM MINA I KNEW THAT THE FRIEND OF THAT POOR LILY GIRL MUST BE GOOD BUT I HAD YET TO LEARN HE FINISHED HIS SPEECH WITH A COURTLY BOW
IT CAN BUT MAKE YOUR HUSBAND LOVE YOU THE MORE AND ALL US YOUR FRIENDS MORE HONOUR YOU AS WELL AS MORE ESTEEM AND LOVE SHE TOOK IT BACK WITH ANOTHER BLUSH AND A BRIGHT SMILE AND SO NOW UP TO THIS VERY HOUR ALL THE RECORDS WE HAVE ARE COMPLETE AND IN ORDER
HE SAID TO MISSUS HARKER I AM TOLD MADAM MINA BY MY FRIEND JOHN THAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND HAVE PUT UP IN EXACT ORDER ALL THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN UP TO THIS MOMENT NOT UP TO THIS MOMENT PROFESSOR SHE SAID IMPULSIVELY BUT UP TO THIS MORNING BUT WHY NOT UP TO NOW
OR THINK THEY KNOW SOME THINGS WHICH OTHER MEN HAVE TOLD THEM AH IT IS THE FAULT OF OUR SCIENCE THAT IT WANTS TO EXPLAIN ALL AND IF IT EXPLAIN NOT THEN IT SAYS THERE IS NOTHING TO EXPLAIN
I DON'T KNOW BUT WHAT IF YOU DON'T SEE HIM SOON HE WILL HAVE ONE OF HIS VIOLENT FITS
HE GAVE ME THE DESTINATIONS OF THE BOXES
WHEN I WENT INTO THE ROOM I TOLD THE MAN THAT A LADY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM TO WHICH HE SIMPLY ANSWERED WHY SHE IS GOING THROUGH THE HOUSE
BUT EVEN BY HIS PATIENTS WHO BEING SOME OF THEM HARDLY IN MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM
THAT AWFUL JOURNAL GETS HOLD OF MY IMAGINATION AND TINGES EVERYTHING WITH SOMETHING OF ITS OWN COLOUR OF COURSE IT IS ABOUT LUCY THAT HABIT CAME BACK TO THE POOR DEAR AND THAT AWFUL NIGHT ON THE CLIFF MUST HAVE MADE HER ILL
AND TRY TO BEHAVE MORE DISCREETLY HE SUDDENLY STOPPED AND LOOKED AT ME INTENTLY FOR SEVERAL MOMENTS THEN WITHOUT A WORD HE ROSE AND MOVING OVER SAT DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE BED THE COLLAPSE HAD COME
I HAD A LETTER FROM ARTHUR WRITTEN ON SUNDAY AND FROM IT I GATHER
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT OUR FIRST STEP SHOULD BE TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER ALL THE REST REMAIN IN THE HOUSE BEYOND THAT WALL WHERE WE LOOK TO DAY OR WHETHER ANY MORE HAVE BEEN REMOVED IF THE LATTER WE MUST TRACE HERE
YOU WILL TELL ME OF HUSBAND JONATHAN'S TROUBLE SO FAR AS YOU CAN BUT NOT YET YOU MUST EAT NOW AFTERWARDS YOU SHALL TELL ME ALL AFTER LUNCH WHEN WE WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM HE SAID TO ME
TWENTY FIVE SEPTEMBER COME TO DAY BY QUARTER PAST TEN TRAIN IF YOU CAN CATCH IT CAN SEE YOU ANY TIME YOU CALL WILHELMINA HARKER MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL TWENTY FIVE SEPTEMBER
AND FURTHER IT WOULD OFFER THE ADVANTAGE OF FORESTALLING AT ONE BLOW ALL OBJECTIONS TO IT AT THE SAME TIME THAT IT WOULD INSURE A JUST ASSESSMENT OF THE LAND TAX SEE IF AT THE MOMENT OF CONVERSION A PIECE OF REAL ESTATE YIELDS AN INCOME OF ONE THOUSAND FRANCS
WHICH CURES ALL EVILS I WILL GO FARTHER I WILL CONFESS THAT OF ALL ABUSES THE MOST HATEFUL TO ME ARE THOSE OF PROPERTY BUT ONCE MORE
BUT MAN ACQUIRES SKILL ONLY BY OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENT HE REFLECTS THEN SINCE TO OBSERVE AND EXPERIMENT IS TO REFLECT HE REASONS SINCE HE CANNOT HELP REASONING IN REFLECTING HE BECOMES DELUDED
IT IS THE DUTY OF THE CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE POWER TO RECONSTRUCT ITSELF ON THE BASIS OF POLITICAL EQUALITY AN EVIL WHEN KNOWN SHOULD BE CONDEMNED AND DESTROYED THE LEGISLATOR CANNOT PLEAD IGNORANCE AS AN EXCUSE FOR UPHOLDING A GLARING INIQUITY
TO WHAT CAUSES MUST WE ATTRIBUTE THE CONTINUALLY INCREASING NUMBER OF SUICIDES AND WHAT ARE THE PROPER MEANS FOR ARRESTING THE EFFECTS OF THIS MORAL CONTAGION
BECAUSE CONJUGAL ASSOCIATION IS A CLOSER RELATION THAN FRATERNAL ASSOCIATION AND BECAUSE THE LIFE OF OUR NEIGHBOR IS NOT OUR PROPERTY BY THE SAME PRINCIPLE INEQUALITY OF WAGES CANNOT BE ADMITTED BY LAW ON THE GROUND OF INEQUALITY OF TALENTS
ENDOWED WITH IMPERIOUS INSTINCTS WHICH ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF HIS REASONING FACULTY AT FIRST HE REFLECTS BUT LITTLE AND REASONS INACCURATELY THEN BENEFITING BY HIS MISTAKES HE RECTIFIES HIS IDEAS AND PERFECTS HIS REASON
WE HAVE ONLY TO TRACE THE PROGRESS OF THIS MORAL REVOLUTION IN THE PERSONNEL
AND THE HUMBLE MULTITUDE THE ANTISTROPHE BURDENED WITH PAINFUL AND DISAGREEABLE TASKS BUT RENDERED OMNIPOTENT BY THEIR NUMBER AND THE HARMONIC ARRANGEMENT OF THEIR FUNCTIONS THE LATTER EXECUTE WHAT THE OTHERS PLAN GUIDED BY THEM
WHO DID NOT KNOW ME WHO MIGHT EVEN HAVE REGARDED HIMSELF AS PERSONALLY ATTACKED BY THE TOO SHARP JUDGMENT WHICH I HAD PASSED UPON THE ECONOMISTS A PUBLICIST AS LEARNED AS HE WAS MODEST LOVED BY THE PEOPLE WHOSE SORROWS HE FELT
OSCILLATING BY VIRTUE OF ITS PRINCIPLE BETWEEN TWO OPPOSITE TERMS EXTREME DIVISION AND EXTREME ACCUMULATION PROPERTY AT ITS FIRST TERM IS ALMOST NULL REDUCED TO PERSONAL EXPLOITATION IT IS PROPERTY ONLY POTENTIALLY
TWO MONTHS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER THE ACADEMY IN ITS DEBATE OF AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH REPLIED TO THE ADDRESS OF ITS PENSIONER BY A NOTE THE TEXT OF WHICH I GIVE BELOW
THE LAW MAKERS ALWAYS DISREGARD THE LATTER AS LONG AS MAN IS OPPOSED TO MAN PROPERTY OFFSETS PROPERTY AND THE TWO FORCES BALANCE EACH OTHER AS SOON AS MAN IS ISOLATED
EVERY MECHANIC WHO CANNOT BE A MASTER HAS TO BE A JOURNEYMAN EVERY PROPRIETOR WHO IS NOT AN INVADER WILL BE INVADED EVERY PRODUCER WHO CANNOT BY THE EXPLOITATION OF OTHER MEN FURNISH PRODUCTS AT LESS THAN THEIR PROPER VALUE WILL LOSE HIS LABOR
THESE AGREEMENTS ESTABLISH ONLY YOUR RIGHT OF USE SUCH HOWEVER ARE THE ONLY TITLES WHICH PROPRIETORS ADVANCE THEY NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER ANY OTHERS INDEED EVERY RIGHT
SUCH IN ITS TRIPLICITY IS THE EXACT DEFINITION OF THE INSTINCTIVE FACULTY WHICH LEADS US INTO COMMUNICATION WITH OUR FELLOWS AND WHOSE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION IS EXPRESSED BY THE FORMULA EQUALITY IN NATURAL WEALTH AND THE PRODUCTS OF LABOR
THEY ABOLISHED SO FAR AS THE SUGAR INDUSTRY WAS CONCERNED THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY
AND SOCIETY IS SUPPORTED BY THE BALANCE AND HARMONY OF THE POWERS WHICH COMPOSE IT SOCIETY AMONG THE ANIMALS IS SIMPLE WITH MAN IT IS COMPLEX MAN IS ASSOCIATED WITH MAN BY THE SAME INSTINCT WHICH ASSOCIATES ANIMAL WITH ANIMAL
THE LATTER MAY ALWAYS ANSWER THAT HE IS FREE THAT IF ACHILLES HAS A STRENGTH OF FOUR FIVE COULD KILL HIM FINALLY THAT IN DOING PERSONAL SERVICE HE INCURS AS GREAT A RISK AS ACHILLES
BUT THE MAJESTIC AND IMPOSING ORDER OF HUMAN SOCIETIES THAT I SOMETIMES FIND MYSELF EMBARRASSED IN ATTACKING CERTAIN ABUSES I LIKE TO REBUILD WITH ONE HAND WHEN I AM COMPELLED TO DESTROY WITH THE OTHER
AND FINALLY THAT MY SOLE PRETENSION IS TO CLEARLY FORMULATE THE GENERAL BELIEF I CANNOT REPEAT IT TOO OFTEN
CHANGED HANDS OR RATHER THAT NEW PROPRIETORS WERE CREATED SOONER OR LATER THE EXTENSION OF PRIVILEGE FAR FROM CURING THE EVIL WAS TO OPERATE TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THE PLEBEIANS
THE JOYS OF SELF SACRIFICE ARE INEFFABLE IF I WERE TO COMPARE HUMAN SOCIETY TO THE OLD GREEK TRAGEDIES I SHOULD SAY THAT THE PHALANX OF NOBLE MINDS AND LOFTY SOULS DANCES THE STROPHE
HE IS AN IMITATOR BUT FOND OF HIS OWN IDEAS AND PASSIONATELY IN LOVE WITH HIS WORKS IF LIKE THE BEES EVERY MAN WERE BORN POSSESSED OF TALENT PERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF CERTAIN KINDS AND IN A WORD AN INNATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FUNCTIONS HE HAS TO PERFORM
FROM THAT TIME EXCLUSIVELY BELONGED TO HIM THAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY SAY RATHER THE RIGHT OF POSSESSION MEN LIVED IN A STATE OF COMMUNISM
AND THEIR UNWARRANTED BLUNDERS HAVE DISGUSTED ME WHOEVER KNOWING THEM PARDONS THEM MAY READ THEM I HAVE SEVERELY BLAMED THE LEARNED CHRISTIAN CHURCH
VERY WELL BUT FROM THIS EXCEPTION WE WILL PASS TO ANOTHER FROM THAT TO A THIRD AND SO ON FROM EXCEPTIONS TO EXCEPTIONS UNTIL WE HAVE REDUCED THE RULE TO A PURE ABSTRACTION HOW MANY SUPPORTERS DO YOU THINK SIR CAN BE CLAIMED FOR THE PROJECT OF THE CONVERSION OF THE PUBLIC FUNDS
PARIS JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN FORTY GENTLEMEN IN THE COURSE OF YOUR DEBATE OF THE NINTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE IN REGARD TO THE TRIENNIAL PENSION ESTABLISHED BY MADAME SUARD
I NO LONGER ASPIRE TO THIS SAD SUCCESS WHY SHOULD I NOT CONFESS IT GENTLEMEN I HAVE ASPIRED TO YOUR SUFFRAGES AND SOUGHT THE TITLE OF YOUR PENSIONER HATING ALL WHICH EXISTS AND FULL OF PROJECTS FOR ITS DESTRUCTION
IS ESPECIALLY ODIOUS SOCIABILITY JUSTICE
EVERY DISCOVERY AND ACT IN SOCIETY IS NECESSARY TO HIM BUT OF THIS IMMENSE QUANTITY OF PRODUCTS AND IDEAS THAT WHICH EACH ONE HAS TO PRODUCE AND ACQUIRE FOR HIMSELF IS BUT AN ATOM IN THE SUN
HE NEVER WOULD DECEIVE HIMSELF AND NEVER WOULD BE TROUBLED BY ERRORS EVILS AND DISORDER IF LIKE THE ANIMALS INSTINCT WERE HIS ONLY GUIDE BUT THE CREATOR HAS ENDOWED US WITH REFLECTION TO THE END THAT OUR INSTINCT MIGHT BECOME INTELLIGENCE
THE VARIETY OF THE FORMS OF PRIVILEGE DOES NOT SANCTION INJUSTICE THE FAITH OF JUPITER
BUT IN WHAT THING EVIDENTLY IN THE PRODUCT NOT IN THE SOIL SO THE ARABS HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD IT AND SO ACCORDING TO CAESAR AND TACITUS THE GERMANS FORMERLY HELD THE ARABS
MAY YOU GENTLEMEN DESIRE EQUALITY AS I MYSELF DESIRE IT MAY YOU FOR THE ETERNAL HAPPINESS OF OUR COUNTRY BECOME ITS PROPAGATORS AND ITS HERALDS
AN IMMORALITY BORN OF VIOLENCE THE MOST MONSTROUS PRETENSION THAT THE CIVIL LAWS EVER SANCTIONED MAN RECEIVES HIS USUFRUCT FROM THE HANDS OF SOCIETY
DESTRUCTIVE NOT ONLY OF SLAVERY BUT OF PROPERTY ITSELF FOR IF THE MASTER CANNOT DRIVE FROM HIS DOMAIN THE SLAVE WHOM HE HAS ONCE ESTABLISHED THERE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SLAVE IS PROPRIETOR AS WELL AS THE MASTER THE BARBARIANS
WHOSE TASTES FANCIES AND PROPENSITIES BEING MODIFIED BY DISSIMILAR IDEAS MUST NECESSARILY CONFLICT MAN BY HIS NATURE AND HIS INSTINCT IS PREDESTINED TO SOCIETY BUT HIS PERSONALITY EVER VARYING IS ADVERSE TO IT
SOCIETY INDEMNIFIES IT IS SAID THE DISPOSSESSED PROPRIETOR BUT DOES IT RETURN TO HIM THE TRADITIONAL ASSOCIATIONS THE POETIC CHARM AND THE FAMILY PRIDE WHICH ACCOMPANY PROPERTY
A PRICE IS SET UPON HIS HEAD HE IS A TOOL WITHOUT A CONSCIENCE A CHATTEL WITHOUT PERSONALITY AN IMPECCABLE IRRESPONSIBLE BEING WHO HAS NEITHER RIGHTS NOR DUTIES WHY DID HIS CONDITION IMPROVE
THEIR DUTIES WERE REGULATED WHENCE CAME THE REGULATIONS WHO HAD THE AUTHORITY TO INTRODUCE THEM THE MASTER TOOK A PART OF THE LABOR OF THE SERF THREE DAYS FOR INSTANCE AND LEFT THE REST TO HIM AS FOR SUNDAY THAT BELONGED TO GOD
BUT WHY NEED I GO FARTHER THE CONSEQUENCES ARE PLAIN ENOUGH AND THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO CRITICISE THE WHOLE CODE THE HISTORY OF PROPERTY AMONG THE ANCIENT NATIONS IS THEN
AND THEIR CIVIL LIST BY THE TOTAL SOCIAL PRODUCTION DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF CITIZENS THUS JURISPRUDENCE POLITICAL ECONOMY AND PSYCHOLOGY AGREE IN ADMITTING THE LAW OF EQUALITY RIGHT AND DUTY
AND TO MAKE THEM OUR EQUALS TO PAY TO THE STRONG A JUST TRIBUTE OF GRATITUDE AND HONOR WITHOUT ENSLAVING OURSELVES TO THEM TO CHERISH OUR NEIGHBORS FRIENDS AND EQUALS FOR THAT WHICH WE RECEIVE FROM THEM EVEN BY RIGHT OF EXCHANGE
I WILL SAY COMMUNISM THE FIRST EXPRESSION OF THE SOCIAL NATURE IS THE FIRST TERM OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT THE THESIS PROPERTY THE REVERSE OF COMMUNISM IS THE SECOND TERM THE ANTITHESIS WHEN WE HAVE DISCOVERED THE THIRD TERM
THIS EXPLAINS THE OBSCURITY WHICH SURROUNDS THE NAMES OF EARLY INVENTORS
THEY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A LEGAL PRIVILEGE PROPERTY SAID THE LENDER
SUCH SIR MUST BE THE RESULT SOONER OR LATER OF THE CONVERSION WHICH HAS BEEN SO LONG DEMANDED OTHERWISE THE FINANCIAL OPERATION OF WHICH WE ARE SPEAKING WOULD BE A CRYING INJUSTICE UNLESS INTENDED AS A STEPPING STONE
IT SUPERADDS ESTEEM AND THEREBY FORMS IN MAN A THIRD DEGREE OF SOCIABILITY
IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH THE OPPOSITE PRINCIPLE AND TO FORMULATE THE SYSTEM WHICH MUST PROCEED FROM IT STILL FURTHER IT IS NECESSARY TO SHOW THE METHOD BY WHICH THE NEW SYSTEM
AS LONG AS THE GERMAN TRIBES DWELT IN THEIR FORESTS IT DID NOT OCCUR TO THEM TO DIVIDE AND APPROPRIATE THE SOIL THE LAND WAS HELD IN COMMON EACH INDIVIDUAL COULD PLOW SOW AND REAP BUT WHEN THE
UNLESS THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION WERE AT THE SAME TIME SECURED TO HIM TO FORTIFY THE WEAK AGAINST THE INVASION OF THE STRONG TO SUPPRESS SPOLIATION AND FRAUD
OR BETWEEN ONE FACULTY AND ANOTHER IN THE SAME INDIVIDUAL THERE IS AN INFINITE DIFFERENCE THIS DIFFERENCE OF DEGREE IN THE SAME FACULTIES THIS PREDOMINANCE OF TALENT IN CERTAIN DIRECTIONS IS WE HAVE SAID THE VERY FOUNDATION OF OUR SOCIETY
ANY ONE WHO WISHING TO PUBLISH A TREATISE UPON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE COUNTRY COULD NOT SATISFY THIS THREEFOLD CONDITION WOULD BE OBLIGED TO PROCURE THE ENDORSEMENT OF A RESPONSIBLE PATRON POSSESSING THE REQUISITE QUALIFICATIONS BUT WE FRENCHMEN HAVE THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS
IN THIS CASE INSTINCTIVE JUSTICE BELIES LEGAL JUSTICE WHO HAS NOT HEARD OF THE INEXTRICABLE CONFUSION INTO WHICH THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES WAS THROWN LAST YEAR WHILE DISCUSSING THE QUESTION OF COLONIAL AND NATIVE SUGARS DID THEY LEAVE THESE TWO INDUSTRIES TO THEMSELVES
IN RIGHT CAN NEVER REMAIN FIXED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE IN FACT THAT IT CAN EVER BECOME PROPERTY EVERY OCCUPANT IS THEN NECESSARILY A POSSESSOR
F CUVIER INTRODUCTION TO THE ANIMAL KINGDOM INTELLIGENCE AND INSTINCT BEING COMMON THEN THOUGH IN DIFFERENT DEGREES TO ANIMALS AND MAN WHAT IS THE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE LATTER ACCORDING TO F CUVIER IT IS
AND HIS PECULIUM IN RETURN FOR WHICH HE PAID RENT AND PERFORMED SERVICE THEY WERE RARELY SEPARATED FROM THEIR HOMES WHEN THEIR LAND WAS SOLD THEY AND ALL THAT THEY HAD BECAME THE PROPERTY OF THE PURCHASER
TO DIMINISH IT OR TO CHANGE ITS NATURE HE CANNOT SO DIVIDE THE USUFRUCT THAT ANOTHER SHALL PERFORM THE LABOR WHILE HE RECEIVES THE PRODUCT IN A WORD
POSSESSION AGRICULTURE WAS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN RACE AND AGRICULTURE IN ITS TURN FAVORS POPULATION AND NECESSITATES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PERMANENT PROPERTY
INSTEAD OF BEING ASSOCIATED ARE THEMSELVES IN THE SERVICE OF AGAMEMNON WHO PAYS THEM THERE IS NO OBJECTION TO ARISTOTLE'S METHOD THE SLAVE OWNER WHO CONTROLS HIS SLAVES MAY GIVE A DOUBLE ALLOWANCE OF BRANDY TO HIM WHO DOES DOUBLE WORK
WAS ALSO THAT WHICH REGULATED THE JUDICIARY AND CREATED A SORT OF LAW FOR THE SLAVE BUT THIS LAW ITSELF ON WHAT DID IT BEAR WHAT WAS ITS PRINCIPLE WHAT WAS THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE COUNCILS AND POPES WITH REFERENCE TO THIS MATTER
INSTINCT IS A NATURAL AND INHERENT FACULTY LIKE FEELING IRRITABILITY OR INTELLIGENCE
IT IS GIVEN THEM ONLY AS A PROVISION AGAINST UNEXPECTED ACCIDENTS WHICH MIGHT DISTURB THESE OPERATIONS IN MAN ON THE CONTRARY INSTINCTIVE ACTION IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING INTO DELIBERATE ACTION
INTERNAL DISSENSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO ORDERS OF THE REPUBLIC
AND ALL THAT IS OF NO USE TO YOU WHEN NO MARKET COULD BE FOUND FOR THE SLAVES THAT WERE WORN OUT BY SICKNESS OR OLD AGE THEY WERE ABANDONED TO STARVATION CLAUDIUS WAS THE FIRST DEFENDER OF THIS SHAMEFUL PRACTICE
IN A MUCH GOVERNED STATE NO ONE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO ATTACK THE EXTERNAL FORM OF THE SOCIETY AND THE GROUNDWORK OF ITS INSTITUTIONS UNTIL HE HAD ESTABLISHED HIS RIGHT TO DO SO FIRST BY HIS MORALITY SECOND BY HIS CAPACITY AND THIRD BY THE PURITY OF HIS INTENTIONS
SOCIETY WITHOUT JUSTICE IS A SOLECISM IF IN ORDER TO REWARD TALENT I TAKE FROM ONE TO GIVE TO ANOTHER IN UNJUSTLY STRIPPING THE FIRST I DO NOT ESTEEM HIS TALENT AS I OUGHT IF IN SOCIETY
THAT IS THAT INHERITANCE AND SUCCESSION WILL LAST FOR EVER WHOEVER MAY BE THE RECOGNIZED HEIR BUT THE SAINT SIMONIANS WISH THE HEIR TO BE DESIGNATED BY THE MAGISTRATE
A THING WHICH HAPPENED ALMOST EVERY DAY AND EQUIP AND FEED HIMSELF AT HIS OWN EXPENSE THIS SPIRIT OF THE GERMAN TRIBES THIS SPIRIT OF COMPANIONSHIP AND ASSOCIATION GOVERNED THE TERRITORY AS IT GOVERNED INDIVIDUALS THE LANDS LIKE THE MEN
WHOEVER VIOLATED IT WAS UNJUST THUS LABOR GIVES BIRTH TO PRIVATE POSSESSION THE RIGHT IN A THING
NOW THIS SO CALLED CONVERSION IS AN EXTENSIVE EXPROPRIATION AND IN THIS CASE WITH NO INDEMNITY WHATEVER THE PUBLIC FUNDS ARE SO MUCH REAL ESTATE THE INCOME FROM WHICH THE PROPRIETOR COUNTS UPON WITH PERFECT SAFETY
AND YOU WILL TAKE HIGH RANK IN SCIENCE WHOSE FIRST PRECEPT IS CALMNESS AND IMPARTIALITY FAREWELL SIR NO MAN'S ESTEEM FOR ANOTHER CAN EXCEED MINE FOR YOU BLANQUI
AND TO BESTOW SOMETHING ON THE CHURCH OF HIS FREEHOLD THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE PROTECTION AND SECURITY
BUT SEE TO IT SIR THAT ERE LONG THEY DO NOT COME IN SPITE OF YOU TO SEEK FOR AMMUNITION IN THIS FORMIDABLE ARSENAL AND THAT YOUR VIGOROUS METAPHYSICS FALLS NOT INTO THE HANDS OF SOME SOPHIST OF THE MARKET PLACE
SO THAT THE RACE AS WELL AS THE INDIVIDUAL BECOMES MORE AND MORE INTELLIGENT THE ANIMALS DO NOT TRANSMIT THEIR KNOWLEDGE THAT WHICH EACH INDIVIDUAL ACCUMULATES DIES WITH HIM
REASON WITH THEIR SUBJECTS AND DO WONDERFUL THINGS STILL MORE IF AS SOME PRETEND KINGS ARE PUBLIC FUNCTIONARIES THE LOVE WHICH IS DUE THEM IS MEASURED BY THEIR PERSONAL AMIABILITY OUR OBLIGATION TO OBEY THEM BY THE WISDOM OF THEIR COMMANDS
UNLESS FRANCE WITH A SUDDEN BURST OF HER POWERFUL VOICE PROCLAIMS IN THUNDER TONES THE ABOLITION OF THE REGIME OF PROPERTY HERE MY TASK SHOULD END I HAVE PROVED THE RIGHT OF THE POOR I HAVE SHOWN THE USURPATION OF THE RICH
THAT IS THE LAW OF DESPOTISM THE RIGHT OF SLAVERY
OR WAS IT THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF THAT SPIRIT OF JUSTICE INFUSED WITH RELIGION
IN THIS SON OF EARTH WHO PASSES AWAY LIKE A SHADOW THERE EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO EXTERNAL THINGS ONLY TITLES OF POSSESSION NOT ONE TITLE OF PROPERTY WHY THEN
AND INTERPRETATIONS OF THEM I WOULD REMIND HIM THAT THE VERY OBJECT OF THIS MEMOIR IS TO ESTABLISH THE CONFORMITY OF MY OPINION CONCERNING PROPERTY WITH THAT UNIVERSALLY HELD THAT
THE MEANS OF HIS SUBSISTENCE HE WILL SELL IT
AMONG THE ANCIENTS THE REFUSAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL LIMITED THE POWERS OF THE STATE
IN WHAT DID IT DIFFER FROM ROMAN SLAVERY AND WHENCE CAME THIS DIFFERENCE LET THE SAME AUTHOR ANSWER
HAS ALWAYS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD IF BY AN INFALLIBLE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION I ESTABLISH THE DOGMA OF EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS IF I DETERMINE THE PRINCIPLE OF CIVIL LAW THE ESSENCE OF JUSTICE AND THE FORM OF SOCIETY
THE FOLLOWING LETTER SERVED AS A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS MEMOIR
INSTEAD OF CONFINING ONE TO COMMON PLACES WITHOUT BREADTH OR SIGNIFICANCE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR QUESTION SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AS FOLLOWS
THE CIVIL STATE WAS NEEDED THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN RACE HAD RENDERED AGRICULTURE NECESSARY THE NEED OF SECURING TO THE CULTIVATOR THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR MADE PERMANENT PROPERTY NECESSARY
AND THUS PERCEIVING THAT I HAVE SO MANY ACCOMPLICES YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY DECLARE ME INNOCENT WHAT IS THE LAW OF EXPROPRIATION ON THE GROUND OF PUBLIC UTILITY WHICH EVERYBODY FAVORS AND WHICH IS EVEN THOUGHT TOO LENIENT
A CERTAIN PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY DECIDED LINGUISTIC QUESTIONS BY A PLURALITY OF VOTES OUR PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES
WHOLE NATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO THE CONDITION OF HELOTS NOTHING WOULD HAVE CHANGED UPON THE TERRESTRIAL STAGE EXCEPT THE ACTORS THE BARBARIANS WERE LESS SELFISH LESS IMPERIOUS LESS DISSOLUTE AND LESS CRUEL THAN THE ROMANS
FULL OF OBSTINACY ENEMIES OF PHILOSOPHY BURIED IN LITERALITIES
THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LAND THAT THE GREEKS AND ROMANS PLACED PROPERTY UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE GODS THAT THEY ACCOMPANIED WITH RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES THE WORK OF PARTITIONING THE LAND AND APPRAISING THEIR GOODS
BUT PROPERTY PROPERTY THE RIGHT OF ESCHEAT OVER LANDS WHICH ONE NEITHER OCCUPIES NOR CULTIVATES
WOULD BE EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS THE TASK OF THE TRUE PUBLICIST IN THE AGE IN WHICH WE LIVE IS TO CLOSE THE MOUTHS OF QUACKS AND CHARLATANS AND TO TEACH THE PUBLIC TO DEMAND DEMONSTRATIONS INSTEAD OF BEING CONTENTED WITH SYMBOLS AND PROGRAMMES
YOUR STYLE IS TOO LOFTY EVER TO BE OF SERVICE TO THE MADMEN WHO IN DISCUSSING THE GRAVEST QUESTIONS OF OUR SOCIAL ORDER USE PAVING STONES AS THEIR WEAPONS
NAMELY THAT IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PROPERTY HAD TO BE VIOLATED DID THEY IMPOSE ON EACH INDUSTRY A PROPORTIONAL TAX SO AS TO PRESERVE A BALANCE IN THE MARKET
THEREBY IT ASKED IN LESS GENERAL TERMS WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE SOCIAL EVIL AND WHAT WAS ITS REMEDY YOU ADMITTED THAT YOURSELVES GENTLEMEN
NEVERTHELESS THE NEW SOCIAL ORGANIZATION DID NOT MEET WITH THE SAME END IN ALL PLACES IN LOMBARDY FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE PEOPLE RAPIDLY GROWING RICH THROUGH COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY SOON CONQUERED THE AUTHORITIES
WHAT WAS THE TRUE SYSTEM OF SOCIETY A COMPETITOR
A DIRE AND PERHAPS A NECESSARY EVIL WHEREVER A LANDED ARISTOCRACY EXISTS TO FEED THESE HUNGRY MOUTHS GRAIN WAS BROUGHT FROM AFRICA AND THE PROVINCES AND DISTRIBUTED GRATUITOUSLY AMONG THE NEEDY IN THE TIME OF CAESAR
SLAVE LABOR IS DEATH TO THE RACE OF TYRANTS THE PATRICIAN FAMILIES BECAME EXTINCT AS THE FEUDAL FAMILIES DID AND AS ALL ARISTOCRACIES MUST
THINGS WHICH CANNOT BE MEASURED FROM THIS SEVERAL INFERENCES MAY BE DRAWN ONE THOUGH WE ARE FREE TO GRANT OUR ESTEEM TO ONE MORE THAN TO ANOTHER AND IN ALL POSSIBLE DEGREES
THE DOWNFALL AND DEATH OF SOCIETIES ARE DUE TO THE POWER OF ACCUMULATION POSSESSED BY PROPERTY IN THE MIDDLE AGES TAKE FLORENCE A REPUBLIC OF MERCHANTS AND BROKERS ALWAYS RENT BY ITS WELL KNOWN FACTIONS
DISSENSIONS WHICH GAVE RISE TO CIVIL WARS PROSCRIPTIONS AND LOSS OF LIBERTY AND FINALLY LED TO THE EMPIRE BUT THE PRIMARY AND MEDIATE CAUSE OF THEIR DECLINE WAS THE ESTABLISHMENT BY NUMA OF THE INSTITUTION OF PROPERTY
SOME PHILOSOPHERS PRETEND THAT MAN IN EMPLOYING HIS FORCES UPON A NATURAL OBJECT SAY A FIELD OR A TREE ACQUIRES A RIGHT ONLY TO THE IMPROVEMENTS WHICH HE MAKES
THE PEOPLE CAN EASILY ESCAPE FROM THE TYRANNY OF DESPOTS BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO THROW OFF THE EFFECTS OF THEIR OWN DESPOTISM JUST AS WE AVOID THE ASSASSIN'S STEEL WHILE WE SUCCUMB TO A CONSTITUTIONAL MALADY AS SOON AS A NATION BECOMES PROPRIETOR
HAS BEEN THE LIFE PRINCIPLE AND DEFINITIVE CAUSE OF ALL REVOLUTIONS RELIGIOUS WARS AND WARS OF CONQUEST WHEN THEY HAVE STOPPED SHORT OF THE EXTERMINATION OF RACES HAVE BEEN ONLY ACCIDENTAL DISTURBANCES SOON REPAIRED BY THE MATHEMATICAL PROGRESSION OF THE LIFE OF NATIONS
AND THE CIVIL POWER IS NEVER MORE DISTURBED THAN BY THE FABLES OF THE AGE OF GOLD AND THE REIGN OF ASTREA A YEAR AGO HOWEVER THIS IDEA RECEIVED A SCIENTIFIC DEMONSTRATION WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN SATISFACTORILY ANSWERED AND PERMIT ME TO ADD NEVER WILL BE
WHO ADMIT A MAN'S PROPERTY IN THE FLOCKS WHICH HE HAS RAISED DO NOT REFUSE THE CROP TO HIM WHO PLANTED THE SEED BUT THEY DO NOT SEE WHY ANOTHER HIS EQUAL SHOULD NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO PLANT IN HIS TURN
IN THE FIRST PLACE THE BEES WOULD NOT FAIL TO TRY SOME NEW INDUSTRIAL PROCESS FOR INSTANCE THAT OF MAKING THEIR CELLS ROUND OR SQUARE ALL SORTS OF SYSTEMS AND INVENTIONS WOULD BE TRIED UNTIL LONG EXPERIENCE AIDED BY GEOMETRY
ON THE OTHER HAND THE NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS VARIES CONTINUALLY WITH THE BIRTHS AND DEATHS IT FOLLOWS THAT THE QUANTITY
TAKEN FROM THE ENEMY AND EQUAL TO TWELVE
A SYSTEM WHICH BETTER THAN PROPERTY GUARANTEES THE FORMATION OF CAPITAL AND KEEPS UP THE COURAGE OF ALL
THIS ARGUMENT DID NOT MEET WITH YOUR APPROBATION SINCE WITHOUT DENYING THE RELATION POINTED OUT BY THE COMPETITOR YOU JUDGED AND RIGHTLY GENTLEMEN
THERE MUST BE EQUALITY OF FACILITIES FOR LABOR WHOEVER WITHOUT LABOR GOT POSSESSION BY FORCE OR BY STRATEGY OF ANOTHER'S MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE DESTROYED EQUALITY
WHAT LITTLE THEY KNOW OF THE INDUSTRIAL ARTS THE MASTER PUNISHES THEM WHEN HE CHOOSES KILLS THEM WITH IMPUNITY AND SELLS THEM AND THEIRS LIKE SO MANY CATTLE THE SLAVE HAS NO PERSONALITY AND CONSEQUENTLY NO WEHRGELD
DISCHARGE YOUR OLD WORKMAN SAYS THE ECONOMIST OF THE PROPRIETARY SCHOOL TURN OFF THAT SICK DOMESTIC THAT TOOTHLESS AND WORN OUT SERVANT PUT AWAY THE UNSERVICEABLE BEAUTY TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE USELESS MOUTHS
THERE IS A REMEDY FOR THIS EVIL WITHOUT VIOLATING IT ALL THE MORE WITHOUT DESTROYING IT IF THE PRESENT LAWS ALLOW ABUSE WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THEM OUR CIVIL CODE IS NOT THE KORAN
YOU HAVE NOT WRITTEN DIRECTLY FOR THEM YOU HAVE ISSUED TWO MAGNIFICENT MANIFESTOES THE SECOND MORE GUARDED THAN THE FIRST ISSUE A THIRD MORE GUARDED THAN THE SECOND
BUT HUMANITY CREATED FOR AN IMMORTAL DESTINY IS DEATHLESS THE REVOLUTIONS WHICH DISTURB IT ARE PURIFYING CRISES INVARIABLY FOLLOWED BY MORE VIGOROUS HEALTH IN THE FIFTH CENTURY THE INVASION OF THE BARBARIANS PARTIALLY RESTORED THE WORLD TO A STATE OF NATURAL EQUALITY
WHO RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO LABOR TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY STRONG I TRY TO SERVE AND ENLIGHTEN THEM WHEREAS SOME ENDEAVOR TO MISLEAD THEM
AND THE CUPIDITY OF THE HUSBANDMAN INCREASE IT WAS THOUGHT BEST TO PUT A BRIDLE ON AMBITION BY SETTING BOUNDARIES WHICH AMBITION WOULD IN VAIN ATTEMPT TO OVERSTEP
WHETHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IT MATTERS LITTLE THEN THERE WAS NO PROPERTY NOT EVEN PRIVATE POSSESSION THE GENESIS AND GROWTH OF POSSESSION GRADUALLY FORCING PEOPLE TO LABOR FOR THEIR SUPPORT
I AWARD MORE TO MYSELF THAN TO MY ASSOCIATE WE ARE NOT REALLY ASSOCIATED JUSTICE IS SOCIABILITY AS MANIFESTED IN THE DIVISION OF MATERIAL THINGS SUSCEPTIBLE OF WEIGHT AND MEASURE
A RESUME OF POLITICAL SCIENCE THE MONUMENT OF TWENTY LEGISLATURES A CODE HAS BEEN WRITTEN THE PRIDE OF A CONQUEROR AND THE SUMMARY OF ANCIENT WISDOM WELL OF THIS CHARTER AND THIS CODE NOT ONE ARTICLE SHALL BE LEFT STANDING UPON ANOTHER
AS ROUSSEAU EIGHTY YEARS AGO HANDLED LETTERS WITH A MAGNIFICENT AND POETICAL DISPLAY OF WIT AND KNOWLEDGE SUCH AT LEAST IS MY OPINION
TO SYNTHETIZE THE MONARCHICAL AND DEMOCRATIC FORMS OF GOVERNMENT TO REVERSE THE DIVISION OF POWERS TO GIVE THE EXECUTIVE POWER TO THE NATION AND TO MAKE LEGISLATION A POSITIVE FIXED AND ABSOLUTE SCIENCE WHAT A SERIES OF PARADOXES WHAT A STRING OF DELUSIONS
THEY DISREGARDED IT THE PRESENT WANT OCCUPIED THEIR WHOLE ATTENTION AND AS ORDINARILY HAPPENS IN SUCH CASES THE DISADVANTAGES WERE AT FIRST SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AND THEY PASSED UNNOTICED
OF THE HABITABLE EARTH IF THE CULTIVATOR CEASED TO BE A TENANT WOULD THE LAND BE WORSE CARED FOR THE GUARANTEE AND THE MORALITY OF LABOR UNDER THE REGIME OF PROPERTY
TO GAIN THE VICTORY FOR ONE'S CAUSE IT DOES NOT SUFFICE SIMPLY TO OVERTHROW A PRINCIPLE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHICH HAS THE INDISPUTABLE MERIT OF SYSTEMATICALLY RECAPITULATING OUR POLITICAL THEORIES
TO WEALTH AND POVERTY TO JEALOUSIES AND HATREDS THE CITIES PASSED RAPIDLY FROM THE RANKEST DEMOCRACY UNDER THE YOKE OF A FEW AMBITIOUS LEADERS
A BROTHER IN JESUS CHRIST PURIFIED BY THE SAME BAPTISM AND REDEEMED BY THE SAME SACRIFICE OF THE SON OF GOD IN THE FORM OF MAN
TO FIND THE LAW OF EQUALITY NO LONGER IN CHARITY AND SELF SACRIFICE WHICH ARE NOT BINDING IN THEIR NATURE BUT IN JUSTICE TO BASE EQUALITY OF FUNCTIONS UPON EQUALITY OF PERSONS TO DETERMINE THE ABSOLUTE PRINCIPLE OF EXCHANGE
BUT I HEAR THE EXCLAMATIONS OF THE PARTISANS OF ANOTHER SYSTEM LABOR LABOR THAT IS THE BASIS OF PROPERTY READER DO NOT BE DECEIVED
I VENTURE TO HOPE SIR THAT AFTER YOU HAVE READ THIS LETTER IF YOUR PRUDENCE STILL RESTRAINS YOU YOUR FAIRNESS WILL INDUCE YOU TO DO ME JUSTICE
THAT IS OPPOSED TO THE SOCIETY WHICH HE HIMSELF REPRESENTS JURISPRUDENCE IS AT FAULT THEMIS HAS LOST ONE SCALE OF HER BALANCE LISTEN TO THE PROFESSOR OF RENNES THE LEARNED TOULLIER
AFTER THIS LUDICROUS DECREE WHICH ITS AUTHORS THOUGHT TO RENDER POWERFUL BY GIVING IT THE FORM OF A CONTRADICTION
THE DEAREST PROTEGES OF RELIGION CONSTANTINE WHO EMBODIED IN THE LAWS THE GRAND IDEAS OF CHRISTIANITY VALUED THE LIFE OF A SLAVE AS HIGHLY AS THAT OF A FREEMAN AND DECLARED THE MASTER WHO HAD INTENTIONALLY BROUGHT DEATH UPON HIS SLAVE GUILTY OF MURDER
BY SCIENTIFIC METHODS AND IN A RIGOROUS MANNER I DEVOTED ONE YEAR TO PHILOLOGY AND GRAMMAR LINGUISTICS OR THE NATURAL HISTORY OF SPEECH BEING OF ALL THE SCIENCES THAT
IT WAS THE WARRIOR WHO THROUGH SUPERIORITY OF ARMS ENSLAVED HIS ADVERSARY THE ROMAN WANTED MATTER THE BARBARIAN WANTED MAN CONSEQUENTLY IN THE FEUDAL AGES RENTS WERE ALMOST NOTHING SIMPLY A HARE A PARTRIDGE A PIE
IT CARRIES WITH IT THE RIGHT TO LET TO LEASE TO LOAN AT INTEREST TO PROFIT BY EXCHANGE TO SETTLE ANNUITIES AND TO LEVY A TAX ON A FIELD WHICH INTENT RESERVES
WILL SATISFY ALL THE MORAL AND POLITICAL NEEDS WHICH INDUCED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS THEN OF SUBSEQUENT EVIDENCE DEPENDS THE CORRECTNESS OF MY PRECEDING ARGUMENTS
APPLIED IT TO THE PRINCIPLE OF PROPERTY ITSELF LET ME CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE WRITERS ON JURISPRUDENCE TO THEIR OWN MAXIMS THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY PROVIDED IT CAN HAVE A CAUSE CAN HAVE BUT ONE
THE POSSESSOR OF THIS FARM SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO GUARD HIS REPUTATION AS A GOOD FATHER OF A FAMILY BY PAYING TO SOCIETY TEN THOUSAND FRANCS LESS THE TOTAL COSTS OF CULTIVATION
THEN LIBERTY HALTED THE PRINCE OF THE FEUDATORIES HELD SOLE AND UNDIVIDED SWAY THE NOBLES THE CLERGY THE COMMONERS THE PARLIAMENTS EVERY THING IN SHORT EXCEPT A FEW SEEMING PRIVILEGES WERE CONTROLLED BY THE KING WHO LIKE HIS EARLY PREDECESSORS
PROPERTY HAD TO GIVE WAY TO THE GENERAL WILL SOON IN THE NAME OF PUBLIC UTILITY METHODS OF CULTIVATION AND CONDITIONS OF ENJOYMENT WILL BE PRESCRIBED INSPECTORS OF AGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURES WILL BE APPOINTED
THE SLAVE WAS A THING RELIGION HAS MADE HIM A MAN NOTE THE LAST WORDS
AND IF WE SHOULD CARRY OUT THIS ARITHMETICAL EQUALITY
AND WE BUILD HENCEFORTH UPON THE SAND INSTEAD OF ON A ROCK THAT I CANNOT AGREE TO AND FOR THAT REASON I HAVE CRITICISED YOUR BOOK SO FULL OF BEAUTIFUL PAGES
IN THIS SENSE IT MAY BE SAID THAT LANGUAGE IS NOT THE WORK OF MAN SINCE IT IS NOT THE WORK OF HIS MIND FURTHER THE MECHANISM OF LANGUAGE SEEMS MORE WONDERFUL AND INGENIOUS WHEN IT IS NOT REGARDED AS THE RESULT OF REFLECTION
BUT IT IS THEN THAT THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THOUGHT AND THE TERRIBLE FACULTY OF REASONING LOGICALLY OR ILLOGICALLY TEACH MAN THAT IF EQUALITY IS THE SINE QUA NON OF SOCIETY COMMUNISM IS THE FIRST SPECIES OF SLAVERY
THE RIGHT TO LEND AT INTEREST TO LEASE TO ACQUIRE AND THEN TO LEASE AND LEND AGAIN BUT PROPERTY IS ALSO THE RIGHT TO EXCHANGE TO TRANSFER AND TO SELL IF THEN THE SOCIAL CONDITION IS SUCH THAT THE PROPRIETOR RUINED BY USURY
AND SINCE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE CONVERSION AN EQUALLY PROFITABLE INVESTMENT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE YOU DEPRECIATE HIS PROPERTY THAT SUCH A MEASURE MAY BE JUSTLY EXECUTED IT MUST BE GENERALIZED
ALIKE IN NATURE AND EQUAL IN VALUE SO THE HONEYCOMB IS FORMED OF INDIVIDUAL CELLS CONSTANTLY AND INVARIABLY REPEATED BUT MAN'S INTELLIGENCE FITTED FOR HIS SOCIAL DESTINY AND HIS PERSONAL NEEDS
AND COLLEGES IN THE UNIVERSITIES
THAT IS WHAT I SAID TO THE INSTITUTE AT THE TIME WHEN I PRESENTED MY REPORT UPON YOUR BOOK I KNEW THAT THEY WISHED TO PROCEED AGAINST YOU IN THE COURTS YOU PERHAPS DO NOT KNOW BY HOW NARROW A CHANCE I SUCCEEDED IN PREVENTING THEM
DOMINIUM NON POTEST NISI EX UNA CAUSA
BUT ALTHOUGH EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS IS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF NATURAL RIGHT OF LIBERTY OF THE LAWS OF PRODUCTION OF THE CAPACITY OF PHYSICAL NATURE AND OF THE PRINCIPLE OF SOCIETY ITSELF
THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS NOT BEING DEMONSTRATED THE IDEAS OF THE AUTHOR WERE NOTHING MORE THAN HYPOTHESES FINALLY GENTLEMEN
THE RUDENESS OF FORM WHICH GAVE TO A WORK OF SUCH GRAVITY THE MANNER AND APPEARANCE OF A PAMPHLET FOR YOU QUITE FRIGHTENED ME SIR AND YOUR TALENT WAS NEEDED TO REASSURE ME IN REGARD TO YOUR INTENTIONS
ENTITLED IN ALL RESPECTS TO THE ESTEEM OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND ELOQUENCE OUR LEGISTS DESERVE BUT ONE REPROACH THAT OF AN EXCESSIVE DEFERENCE TO ARBITRARY LAWS
A FINAL ILLUSTRATION WILL MAKE THESE FACTS STILL CLEARER IF TO THE BLIND BUT CONVERGENT AND HARMONIOUS INSTINCTS OF A SWARM OF BEES SHOULD BE SUDDENLY ADDED REFLECTION AND JUDGMENT THE LITTLE SOCIETY COULD NOT LONG EXIST
FOR MY PART I HAVE SWORN FIDELITY TO MY WORK OF DEMOLITION AND I WILL NOT CEASE TO PURSUE THE TRUTH THROUGH THE RUINS AND RUBBISH I HATE TO SEE A THING HALF DONE AND IT WILL BE BELIEVED WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCE OF MINE THAT HAVING DARED TO RAISE MY HAND AGAINST THE HOLY ARK
NOW LIKE THE DISCOVERY OF UNKNOWN QUANTITIES INDUCED BY THE INEVITABLE INFLUENCE OF TIME FIGURES ARE THE PROVIDENCE OF HISTORY UNDOUBTEDLY THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS IN HUMAN PROGRESS BUT IN THE MULTITUDE OF HIDDEN CAUSES WHICH AGITATE NATIONS
THAT IS OF OUR POWERS OF JUDGING AND OF IDEALIZING THIS PRODUCT THE THIRD AND LAST DEGREE OF HUMAN SOCIABILITY IS DETERMINED BY OUR COMPLEX MODE OF ASSOCIATION IN WHICH INEQUALITY
OF MATERIAL WHICH EACH LABORER MAY CLAIM VARIES WITH THE NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS CONSEQUENTLY THAT OCCUPATION IS ALWAYS SUBORDINATE TO POPULATION FINALLY THAT INASMUCH AS POSSESSION
MAN DRAWS NEAR TO MAN AND SHARES WITH HIM THE FRUITS OF THE FIELD AND THE MILK AND FLESH OF ANIMALS LITTLE BY LITTLE THIS COMMUNISM NEGATIVE AS LONG AS MAN DOES NOT PRODUCE TENDS TO BECOME POSITIVE AND ORGANIC THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRY
MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL ECONOMY DEFENDER OF PROPERTY TOOK UP MY DEFENCE BEFORE HIS ASSOCIATES AND BEFORE THE MINISTRY
BUT DESTITUTE OF REFLECTIVE AND REASONING FACULTIES SOCIETY WOULD ORGANIZE ITSELF WE SHOULD SEE ONE MAN PLOWING A FIELD ANOTHER BUILDING HOUSES THIS ONE FORGING METALS THAT ONE CUTTING CLOTHES AND STILL OTHERS STORING THE PRODUCTS AND SUPERINTENDING THEIR DISTRIBUTION
HAS IN ITS CONSTITUTION ALL KINDS OF VIRTUES AND VICES INHERITED FROM OUR ANCESTORS IS PROPERTY THEN IN YOUR EYES A THING SO SIMPLE AND SO ABSTRACT THAT YOU CAN RE KNEAD AND EQUALIZE IT
I CANNOT ACCEPT A PARTNERSHIP WHICH AS FAR AS TALENT GOES WOULD SURELY BE A CREDIT TO ME BUT WHICH WOULD COMPROMISE ME IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS I AGREE WITH YOU IN ONE THING ONLY
TO EACH OF US PROPERTY SEEMS A POLYGON WHOSE ANGLES NEED KNOCKING OFF BUT THE OPERATION PERFORMED
OR TO AGAIN EMPLOY THE FIGURE EVIL IS THE PRODUCT OF INCEST BETWEEN ADVERSE POWERS GOOD WILL SOONER OR LATER BE THE LEGITIMATE CHILD OF THEIR HOLY AND MYSTERIOUS UNION PROPERTY BORN OF THE REASONING FACULTY INTRENCHES ITSELF BEHIND COMPARISONS
IT WAS NOT RIGHT THAT THE SOLDIER ON RETURNING FROM AN EXPEDITION SHOULD FIND HIMSELF DISPOSSESSED ON ACCOUNT OF THE SERVICES WHICH HE HAD JUST RENDERED TO HIS COUNTRY
THIS LAST MOTIVE SEEMS THE MOST PLAUSIBLE ONE FOR IN SPITE OF THE CLAMORS OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND THE FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF CERTAIN RIGHTS THE PUBLIC CONSCIENCE IS BOUND TO FULFIL ITS DESIRE AND IS NO MORE AFFECTED WHEN CHARGED WITH ATTACKING PROPERTY THAN WHEN LISTENING TO THE COMPLAINTS OF THE BONDHOLDERS
IT IS POTHIER WHO SAYS IT SUPPOSES A PRODUCING CAUSE IN THE PERSON WHO ENJOYS IT
AND THE ADJECTIVES JUST MERCIFUL PITIFUL AND THE LIKE SHOULD BE STRICKEN FROM OUR LITANIES GOD CAN BE REGARDED AS JUST EQUITABLE AND GOOD ONLY TO ANOTHER GOD NOW GOD HAS NO ASSOCIATE
WHO MIGHT DISCUSS THE QUESTION IN THE PRESENCE OF A STARVING AUDIENCE WE SHOULD HAVE PILLAGE FOR CONCLUSION AND PERORATION
WITH A LIGHT PAIR O HEELS BUT I HAD BEEN VEXED TO DEATH WITH THEIR RED TAPE RIGGING AT THE COMPANY'S OFFICE AND CHILLED WITH STAYIN ON DECK AN TRYIN TO HURRY UP THINGS AND WHEN WE WERE WELL OUT O SIGHT O LAND
I SAID I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVICEABLE
HE SAT LOOKING AT ME EXPECTANTLY I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT WITH HIS QUEER HEAD AND LENGTH OF THINNESS HE WAS MADE TO HOP ALONG THE ROAD OF LIFE
SOMEBODY OBSERVED ONCE THAT YOU COULD PICK OUT THE LIKENESS OF MOST EVERY SORT OF A FOREIGNER WHEN YOU LOOKED ABOUT YOU IN OUR PARISH SAID SISTER CAPLIN HER FACE BRIGHTENING WITH SUDDEN ILLUMINATION I DIDN'T SEE THE BEARIN OF IT THEN QUITE SO PLAIN
WHILE DINNER WAS GETTING READY SO NOT WITHOUT A DEEP SENSE OF PLEASURE AND A DELIGHTED LOOK OF SURPRISE FROM THE TWO HOSTESSES WE STARTED WILLIAM AND I AS IF BOTH OF US FELT MUCH YOUNGER THAN WE LOOKED
NEVER'D LOOK SO DISCONSOLATE IF SHE WAS ANY SORT OF A PROPER PERSON TO DIRECT THINGS SHE MIGHT DIVERT HIM YES SHE MIGHT DIVERT THE OLD GENTLEMAN AN LET HIM THINK HE HAD HIS OWN WAY STEAD O ARGUING EVERYTHING DOWN TO THE BARE BONE
WEATHER AN OCCASION BOTH MADE TO MATCH YES IT SUITS ME I DON'T ASK NO MORE I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU SAW MOTHER WALKIN AT THE HEAD IT CHOKED ME RIGHT UP TO SEE MOTHER AT THE HEAD WALKIN WITH THE MINISTERS
JUST AS THE DAY REACHED ITS HIGHEST POINT OF HEAT WE COULD SEE THE GREEN SUNLIT FIELD WE HAD JUST CROSSED AS IF WE LOOKED OUT AT IT FROM A DARK ROOM
LAND SAKES ALIVE
SHIPPING'S A TERRIBLE LOSS TO THIS PART O NEW ENGLAND FROM A SOCIAL POINT O VIEW MA'AM I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT MYSELF I RETURNED
IN BOTH HER APPEARANCE AND HER CHARMING GIFTS
AND TALK A TERRIBLE WHILE ABOUT THEIR HAVIN SO MUCH INFORMATION AND THE MONEY THAT COULD BE MADE OUT OF KEEPIN EM HE WAS ONE OF THE SMARTEST CAPTAINS
BEYOND THE FIELDS AND COVE A HIGHER POINT OF LAND RAN OUT INTO THE BAY COVERED WITH WOODS WHICH MUST HAVE KEPT AWAY MUCH OF THE NORTHWEST WIND IN WINTER
SERENE AND MINDFUL OF PRIVILEGE AND RESPONSIBILITY THE MISTRESS BY SIMPLE FITNESS OF THIS GREAT DAY MISSUS TODD LOOKED UP AT THE ROOF OF GREEN TREES AND THEN CAREFULLY SURVEYED THE COMPANY
IN MONGST THE CLIMBIN' BEANS SHE SMILED
YET STILL BE HEARD WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A COMPANY OF ANCIENT GREEKS GOING TO CELEBRATE A VICTORY OR TO WORSHIP THE GOD OF HARVESTS IN THE GROVE ABOVE IT WAS STRANGELY MOVING TO SEE THIS AND TO MAKE PART OF IT
I WAS SURE THAT MISSUS BLACKETT MUST BE WAITING IMPATIENTLY TO SLICE THE POTATOES INTO THE CHOWDER LAYER AFTER LAYER WITH THE FISH YOU LET ME TAKE HOLT O THAT BASKET MA'AM SAID THE PLEASANT ANXIOUS VOICE BEHIND ME I TURNED
MISSUS TODD TURNED TO ME WITH A LOVELY LOOK OF TRIUMPH AND SELF FORGETFULNESS AN ELDERLY MAN WHO WORE THE LOOK OF A PROSPEROUS SEA CAPTAIN PUT UP BOTH ARMS
SUCH A DAY AS THIS HAS TRANSFIGURING POWERS AND EASILY MAKES FRIENDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN COLD HEARTED AND GIVES TO THOSE WHO ARE DUMB THEIR CHANCE TO SPEAK
AND THE CREW DONE THEIR WORK BY DINT OF HARD DRIVING I BEGAN TO FIND THIS UNEXPECTED NARRATIVE A LITTLE DULL CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE SPOKE WITH A KIND OF SLOW CORRECTNESS THAT LACKED THE LONGSHORE HIGH FLAVOR TO WHICH I HAD GROWN USED
BUT THEY WERE NOT MANY SO I SAID TO MYSELF THEIR ANCESTORS MAY HAVE SAT IN THE GREAT HALL OF SOME OLD FRENCH HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN BATTLES AND SIEGES AND PROCESSIONS AND FEASTS
I ALWAYS DID THINK MARI HARRIS RESEMBLED A CHINEE MARI HARRIS WAS PRETTY AS A CHILD I REMEMBER SAID THE PLEASANT VOICE OF MISSUS BLACKETT WHO AFTER RECEIVING THE AFFECTIONATE GREETINGS OF NEARLY THE WHOLE COMPANY
AND BEAT ITSELF AGAINST THE WALLS FOR A MINUTE AND ESCAPED AGAIN TO THE OPEN AIR BUT CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE TOOK NO NOTICE WHATEVER OF THE FLURRY I HAD A VALUABLE CARGO
AND THE SHADE WAS PLEASANT AS WE CLIMBED THE HILL WILLIAM STOPPED ONCE OR TWICE TO SHOW ME A GREAT WASPS' NEST CLOSE BY OR SOME FISHHAWKS' NESTS BELOW IN A BIT OF SWAMP
WITH A SIMPLE KINDNESS THAT WAS THE SOUL OF CHIVALRY WAITED UPON US AND OUR BASKETS AND LED AWAY THE WHITE HORSE I ALREADY KNEW SOME OF MISSUS TODD'S FRIENDS AND KINDRED AND FELT LIKE AN ADOPTED BOWDEN IN THIS HAPPY MOMENT
THE MINISTER STOOD THERE IN THE PULPIT TRYIN TO KEEP SOBER AN ALL AT ONCE HE BURST RIGHT OUT LAUGHIN HE WAS A VERY NICE MAN THEY SAID AND HE SAID HE'D BETTER GIVE EM THE BENEDICTION AND THEY COULD HEAR THE SERMON NEXT SUNDAY
CAME TO JOIN US TO SEE AS SHE INSISTED THAT WE WERE OUT OF MISCHIEF YES MARI WAS ONE O THEM PRETTY LITTLE LAMBS THAT MAKE DREADFUL HOMELY OLD SHEEP REPLIED MISSUS TODD WITH ENERGY CAP'N LITTLEPAGE
HE COPIED LIFE BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT UP WITH A GREAT DEAL OF LOW TALK I NOW REMEMBERED THAT MISSUS TODD HAD TOLD ME ONE DAY THAT CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE HAD OVERSET HIS MIND WITH TOO MUCH READING
AS I LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE TABLES THERE WAS A GOOD CHEER A GRAVE SOBERNESS THAT SHONE WITH PLEASURE A HUMBLE DIGNITY OF BEARING THERE WERE SOME WHO SHOULD HAVE SAT BELOW THE SALT FOR LACK OF THIS GOOD BREEDING
AND WOULD NOT ANSWER THE RUDDER OR PROPERLY RESPOND TO THE MOST CAREFUL SETTING OF SAILS SO THERE WE WERE BLOWIN ALONG ANYWAYS HE COMPLAINED
RIGHT FOR WILLIAM'S FISH HOUSE FIVE MILES OUT ON GREEN ISLAND OR UP THERE ON BURNT ISLAND WHERE THE SIGNAL IS HE HAD IT ALL OVER TO ME ONE DAY AN I TRIED HARD TO APPEAR INTERESTED HIS LIFE'S ALL IN IT
THERE WAS AN INSTANT CRY OF REJOICING AND TWO OR THREE PERSONS RAN TOWARD US FROM THE BUSY GROUP WHY DEAR MIS BLACKETT HERE'S MIS BLACKETT I HEARD THEM SAY AS IF IT WERE PLEASURE ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY TO HAVE A SIGHT OF HER
TURNED AWAY TO HIDE THE FEELINGS SHE COULD NOT INSTANTLY CONTROL WHO WAS THE MARSHAL I HASTENED TO ASK WAS HE AN OLD SOLDIER DON'T HE DO WELL ANSWERED MISSUS TODD WITH SATISFACTION
THEY FANCY THAT THEY COMPREHEND THE UNIVERSE I SMILED AND WAITED FOR HIM TO GO ON
I'VE HAD TO FAVOR OLD MIS EVINS WITH DRYIN YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT IN THEIR EXPRESSIONS ALL THEM EVINS FOLKS THERE JUST YOU LOOK UP TO THE CROSSROADS MOTHER SHE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED SEE ALL THE TEAMS AHEAD OF US
THERE WAS A FLASHING OF WHITE GULLS OVER THE WATER WHERE THE FLEET OF BOATS RODE THE LOW WAVES TOGETHER IN THE COVE SWAYING THEIR SMALL MASTS AS IF THEY KEPT TIME TO OUR STEPS
I FELT SOMEWHAT DISTURBED AND RESPONSIBLE BUT WHEN I JOINED THEM THEY WERE ON MOST SIMPLE AND FRIENDLY TERMS IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT WITH WILLIAM IT WAS THE FIRST STEP THAT COST AND THAT HAVING ONCE JOINED IN SOCIAL INTERESTS
HAD MADE HIS HOME THERE AND IT WAS STILL THE BOWDEN FARM FIVE GENERATIONS OF SAILORS AND FARMERS AND SOLDIERS HAD BEEN ITS CHILDREN AND PRESENTLY MISSUS BLACKETT
OVER TO THE PORT THEY ALWAYS INVITE HIM TO MARCH DECORATION DAY SAME AS THE REST AN HE DOES LOOK NOBLE HE COMES OF SOLDIER STOCK
AFTER A SEASON OF REFLECTION WE WERE JUST WAITING FOR THE FEAST TO BEGIN
I HAD BEEN NOTICING WITH GREAT INTEREST THE CURIOUSLY FRENCH TYPE OF FACE WHICH PREVAILED IN THIS RUSTIC COMPANY I HAD SAID TO MYSELF BEFORE THAT MISSUS BLACKETT WAS PLAINLY OF FRENCH DESCENT
I SAID RISING TO MEET HIM AND HE ENTERED BOWING WITH MUCH COURTESY I STEPPED DOWN FROM THE DESK AND OFFERED HIM A CHAIR BY THE WINDOW WHERE HE SEATED HIMSELF AT ONCE BEING SADLY SPENT BY HIS CLIMB
AND HELD IT CAPTIVE ONE SEES EXACTLY THE SAME TYPES IN A COUNTRY GATHERING AS IN THE MOST BRILLIANT CITY COMPANY
BUT HE WILL HAVE THOSE POOR GLOOMY SPELLS COME OVER HIM NOW AN THEN AN THEN HE HAS TO DRINK MISSUS CAPLIN GAVE A HEAVY SIGH THERE'S A GREAT MANY SUCH STRAYAWAY FOLKS
I COUNTED THREE OR FOUR THAT WERE BAFFLED BY THE LIGHT BREEZE BUT BEFORE LONG ALL THE BOWDENS SMALL AND GREAT SEEMED TO HAVE ASSEMBLED AND WE STARTED TO GO UP TO THE GROVE ACROSS THE FIELD
SMALL COMPANIES WERE CONTINUALLY COMING UP THE LONG GREEN SLOPE FROM THE WATER AND NEARLY ALL THE BOATS HAD COME TO SHORE
SHE HAD SIMPLY GROWN SLUGGISH FOR LACK OF PROPER SURROUNDINGS SHE WAS NOT SO MUCH REMINISCENT NOW AS EXPECTANT AND AS ALERT AND GAY AS A GIRL WE WHO WERE HER NEIGHBORS WERE FULL OF GAYETY
SHE ADDED WISTFULLY WE ALWAYS HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER WHY IF IT IS A GOOD PLEASANT DAY TOMORROW
I RETURNED TO MY FIXED SEAT BEHIND THE TEACHER'S DESK WHICH GAVE HIM THE LOWER PLACE OF A SCHOLAR YOU OUGHT TO HAVE THE PLACE OF HONOR CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE I SAID A HAPPY RURAL SEAT OF VARIOUS VIEWS
I'VE GOT NEW DOUGHNUTS DEAR SAID THE LITTLE OLD LADY
AS IF FROM THE INEXHAUSTIBLE BURNING HEART OF THE EARTH THE PRIMAL FIRES BREAK THROUGH THE GRANITE DUST IN WHICH OUR SOULS ARE SET EACH HEART IS WARM AND EVERY FACE SHINES WITH THE ANCIENT LIGHT
I BEGAN TO RESPECT THE BOWDENS FOR THEIR INHERITANCE OF GOOD TASTE AND SKILL AND A CERTAIN PLEASING GIFT OF FORMALITY SOMETHING MADE THEM DO ALL THESE THINGS IN A FINER WAY THAN MOST COUNTRY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DONE THEM
I SEE EM BETTER NOW THEY'RE ALL SETTIN DOWN SHE SAID WITH SATISFACTION
WE NEVER HAD FITS NONE OF US AND TWAS LUCKY WE DIDN'T WAY OUT THERE TO GREEN ISLAND NOW THESE FOLKS RIGHT IN FRONT
BUT THEY WERE SOME ACQUAINTED WITH FOREIGN LANDS AN THEIR LAWS AN COULD SEE OUTSIDE THE BATTLE FOR TOWN CLERK HERE IN DUNNET THEY GOT SOME SENSE O PROPORTION YES THEY LIVED MORE DIGNIFIED AND THEIR HOUSES WERE BETTER WITHIN AN WITHOUT
WE RANKED BY FOURS AND EVEN THEN WE MADE A LONG PROCESSION THERE WAS A WIDE PATH MOWED FOR US ACROSS THE FIELD AND AS WE MOVED ALONG
NOW THERE WAS A PLEASANT LOOK OF SHADE AND SHELTER THERE FOR THE GREAT FAMILY MEETING WE HURRIED ON OUR WAY BEGINNING TO FEEL AS IF WE WERE VERY LATE AND IT WAS A GREAT SATISFACTION
GOOD FOR NOTHING ELSE MOST O HIS TIME TROUBLE IS HE I TURNED WITH INTEREST TO HEAR THE WORST MISSUS CAPLIN'S TONE WAS BOTH ZEALOUS AND IMPRESSIVE STIM'LATES SHE EXPLAINED SCORNFULLY
HE WAS ABLE TO PURSUE THEM WITH MORE OR LESS PLEASURE HE WAS ABOUT SIXTY AND NOT YOUNG LOOKING FOR HIS YEARS
WE CARRIED THE TOKENS AND INHERITANCE OF ALL SUCH HOUSEHOLDS FROM WHICH THIS HAD DESCENDED AND WERE ONLY THE LATEST OF OUR LINE WE POSSESSED THE INSTINCTS OF A FAR FORGOTTEN CHILDHOOD
HE IS GREATER EVEN THAN A KING OR A SCHOOLMASTER CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE MOVED HIS CHAIR OUT OF THE WAKE OF THE SUNSHINE AND STILL SAT LOOKING AT ME I BEGAN TO BE VERY EAGER TO KNOW UPON WHAT ERRAND HE HAD COME
WHERE NOTHING STOLE AWAY THE SHORTEST MINUTE I HAD LOST MYSELF COMPLETELY IN WORK WHEN I HEARD FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE THERE WAS A STEEP FOOTPATH BETWEEN THE UPPER AND THE LOWER ROAD WHICH I CLIMBED TO SHORTEN THE WAY AS THE CHILDREN HAD TAUGHT ME
THERE THEY'RE CALLIN OUT IT'S TIME TO SET THE TABLES SAID MISSUS CAPLIN WITH GREAT EXCITEMENT HERE'S COUSIN SARAH JANE BLACKETT WELL I AM PLEASED CERTAIN
I FOUND MYSELF THINKING THAT WE OUGHT TO BE CARRYING GREEN BRANCHES AND SINGING AS WE WENT
ONE CORNER WAS ALREADY DUG AND I CHOSE A FAT LOOKING HILL WHERE THE TOPS WERE WELL WITHERED THERE IS ALL THE PLEASURE THAT ONE CAN HAVE IN GOLD DIGGING IN FINDING ONE'S HOPES SATISFIED IN THE RICHES OF A GOOD HILL OF POTATOES
I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT ERRAND HAD BROUGHT HIM OUT IN SEARCH OF ME THERE WAS SOMETHING QUITE CHARMING IN HIS APPEARANCE IT WAS A FACE THIN AND DELICATE WITH REFINEMENT BUT WORN INTO APPEALING LINES
AND STRAYING OUT PRESENTLY I FOUND THE HOE BY THE WELL HOUSE AND AN OLD SPLINT BASKET AT THE WOODSHED DOOR AND ALSO FOUND MY WAY DOWN TO THE FIELD WHERE THERE WAS A GREAT SQUARE PATCH OF ROUGH WEEDY POTATO TOPS AND TALL RAGWEED
COMPANY'S SAKE IN DULL DAYS AND NIGHTS HE TURNS TO HIS BOOK MOST OF US OLD SHIPMASTERS CAME TO KNOW MOST EVERYTHING ABOUT SOMETHING
AND THERE WON'T BE A THING SHE'LL EVER REGRET EXCEPT TO MOURN BECAUSE WILLIAM WA'N'T HERE MISSUS BLACKETT HAVING BEEN PROPERLY ESCORTED TO THE HOUSE MISSUS TODD RECEIVED HER OWN FULL SHARE OF HONOR AND SOME OF THE MEN
THE BOWDEN REUNION IT IS VERY RARE IN COUNTRY LIFE
AND OH LOOK DOWN ON THE BAY YES LOOK DOWN ON THE BAY SEE WHAT A SIGHT O BOATS ALL HEADIN FOR THE BOWDEN PLACE COVE OH AIN'T IT BEAUTIFUL SAID MISSUS BLACKETT WITH ALL THE DELIGHT OF A GIRL
WE'RE ALL TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND GOING BACK YEAR BY YEAR OH NO CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE I HOPE NOT SAID I TRYING TO SOOTHE HIS FEELINGS THERE WAS A SILENCE IN THE SCHOOLHOUSE
HE QUOTED AS HE GAZED OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE AND UP THE LONG WOODED SHORE THEN HE GLANCED AT ME AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HIM AS PLEASED AS A CHILD MY QUOTATION WAS FROM PARADISE LOST THE GREATEST OF POEMS
FOR JUST THAT CLASS O MEN
BUT WHEN AT LONG INTERVALS THE ALTARS TO PATRIOTISM TO FRIENDSHIP TO THE TIES OF KINDRED ARE REARED IN OUR FAMILIAR FIELDS THEN THE FIRES GLOW THE FLAMES COME UP
AND SO IT PROVED SHE HAD BEEN AN EXCELLENT VESSEL IN HER DAY OF THE COWARDS ABOARD HER I CAN'T SAY SO MUCH THEN YOU WERE WRECKED I ASKED AS HE MADE A LONG PAUSE
THERE WAS NO MORE TIME FOR CONVERSATION UNTIL WE WERE SEATED IN ORDER AT THE LONG TABLES I'M ONE THAT ALWAYS DREADS SEEING SOME O THE FOLKS THAT I DON'T LIKE AT SUCH A TIME AS THIS
I ACCUSTOMED MYSELF TO PLAIN FACTS ON THE INSTANT AND WE SAID GOOD MORNING LIKE OLD FRIENDS THE BASKET WAS REALLY HEAVY AND I PUT THE HOE THROUGH ITS HANDLE AND OFFERED HIM ONE END
TWOULDN'T HURT HER TO SIT DOWN AN HEAR HIS GREAT STORIES ONCE IN A WHILE THE STORIES ARE VERY INTERESTING I VENTURED TO SAY YES YOU ALWAYS CATCH YOURSELF A THINKIN WHAT IF THEY ALL WAS TRUE AND HE HAD THE RIGHT OF IT
THE UNUSED PROVISION OF EVERY SORT THE RESERVE FORCE OF SOCIETY GROWS MORE AND MORE AMAZING TO ONE'S THOUGHT MORE THAN ONE FACE AMONG THE BOWDENS SHOWED THAT ONLY OPPORTUNITY AND STIMULUS WERE LACKING
THOSE WHO HAVE LAUGHED AT ME LITTLE KNOW HOW MUCH REASON MY IDEAS ARE BASED UPON HE WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD THE VILLAGE BELOW
EXCEPT FROM A CHEAP UNPRINCIPLED NEWSPAPER IN THE OLD DAYS A GOOD PART O THE BEST MEN HERE KNEW A HUNDRED PORTS AND SOMETHING OF THE WAY FOLKS LIVED IN THEM THEY SAW THE WORLD FOR THEMSELVES
AMIABILITY TWAS MOST TOO BAD TO CRAMP HIM DOWN TO HIS PEACEFUL TRADE BUT HE'S A MOST EXCELLENT SHOEMAKER AT HIS BEST AN HE ALWAYS SAYS IT'S A TRADE THAT GIVES HIM TIME TO THINK AN PLAN HIS MANEUVERS
I WA'N'T CAUGHT ASTERN O THE LIGHTER
HE HAD THE REFINEMENT OF LOOK AND AIR OF COMMAND WHICH ARE THE HERITAGE OF THE OLD ECCLESIASTICAL FAMILIES OF NEW ENGLAND BUT AS DARWIN SAYS IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY THERE IS NO SUCH KING AS A SEA CAPTAIN
AND THE SHEEP BELL TINKLED AWAY IN HASTE AS IF SOMEONE HAD SHAKEN A STICK IN ITS WEARER'S FACE THEN I LOOKED AND SAW CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE PASSING THE NEAREST WINDOW THE NEXT MOMENT HE TAPPED POLITELY AT THE DOOR COME IN SIR
WHO WOULD HAVE NO SUCH STANDARDS
THE EXCITEMENT OF AN UNEXPECTEDLY GREAT OCCASION WAS A SUBTLE STIMULANT TO HER DISPOSITION AND I COULD SEE THAT SOMETIMES WHEN MISSUS TODD HAD SEEMED LIMITED AND HEAVILY DOMESTIC
AND HE CAN REST WHEN WE GET THERE THE OTHERS ARE SOME LITTLE WAYS AHEAD AND I DON'T WANT TO LOSE A MINUTE WE WATCHED THE BOATS DROP THEIR SAILS ONE BY ONE IN THE COVE AS WE DROVE ALONG THE HIGH LAND
EVEN THE CHILDREN WERE READY TO MARCH TOGETHER A PRETTY FLOCK AND AT THE LAST MOMENT MISSUS BLACKETT AND A FEW DISTINGUISHED COMPANIONS THE MINISTERS AND THOSE WHO WERE VERY OLD CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE TOGETHER AND TOOK THEIR PLACES
THE OLD BOWDEN HOUSE STOOD LOW STORIED AND BROAD ROOFED IN ITS GREEN FIELDS AS IF IT WERE A MOTHERLY BROWN HEN WAITING FOR THE FLOCK THAT CAME STRAYING TOWARD IT FROM EVERY DIRECTION THE FIRST BOWDEN SETTLER
WORE A LOOK OF TROUBLE AND I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE TEASING SPIRIT OF ALMIRA IT WAS TOO PLEASANT TO STAY INDOORS ALTOGETHER EVEN IN SUCH REWARDING COMPANIONSHIP BESIDES I MIGHT MEET WILLIAM
I EXPECT YOU MIGHT HAVE CHOSE A SOMEWHAT LARGER FISH BUT I'LL TRY AN MAKE IT DO I SHALL HAVE TO HAVE A FEW EXTRA POTATOES BUT THERE'S A FIELD FULL OUT THERE AN THE HOE'S LEANIN AGAINST THE WELL HOUSE
THERE USED TO BE AN OLD STORY GOIN ABOUT WHEN I WAS A GIRL SAID MISSUS BLACKETT WITH MUCH AMUSEMENT THERE WAS A GREAT MANY MORE BOWDENS THEN THAN THERE ARE NOW AND THE FOLKS
BEFORE ME MOST BUSINESSLIKE AND INTENT UPON HIS ERRAND WE WENT FROM THE UPPER EDGE OF THE FIELD ABOVE THE HOUSE INTO A SMOOTH BROWN PATH AMONG THE DARK SPRUCES THE HOT SUN BROUGHT OUT THE FRAGRANCE OF THE PITCHY BARK
THAT MY THOUGHTS WERE UNKINDLY WANDERING HE CEASED TO SPEAK
AND FEEL THE COOL SALT BREEZE
AIN'T I JUST BEEN MAINTAININ THAT HE AIN'T LIKE EM URGED MISSUS TODD DECIDEDLY STRANGE FOLKS HAS GOT TO HAVE STRANGE WAYS FOR WHAT I SEE
JUST AS THERE IS PLANTS CONTINUED MISSUS TODD WHO WAS NOTHING IF NOT BOTANICAL I KNOW OF JUST ONE SPRIG OF LAUREL THAT GROWS OVER BACK HERE IN A WILD SPOT
YES SAYS I BUT THINK O THANKSGIVIN TIMES AN FUNERALS SHE'S OUR RELATION AN WE'VE GOT TO OWN HER YOUNG FOLKS DON'T THINK O THOSE THINGS
SAID MISSUS TODD WITH AN ALARMING TRANSITION FROM GENERAL OPINIONS TO PARTICULAR ANIMOSITIES I HATE HER JUST THE SAME AS I ALWAYS DID
I LONGED TO GO ON BUT IT DID NOT SEEM FRUGAL TO DIG ANY LONGER AFTER MY BASKET WAS FULL AND AT LAST I TOOK MY HOE BY THE MIDDLE AND LIFTED THE BASKET TO GO BACK UP THE HILL
THROUGH THIS PIECE OF ROUGH PASTURE RAN A HUGE SHAPE OF STONE LIKE THE GREAT BACKBONE OF AN ENORMOUS CREATURE AT THE END NEAR THE WOODS WE COULD CLIMB UP ON IT AND WALK ALONG TO THE HIGHEST POINT
STARTLED IN THE SILENCE OF THE WIDE FIELD AND SAW AN ELDERLY MAN BENT IN THE SHOULDERS AS FISHERMEN OFTEN ARE GRAY HEADED AND CLEAN SHAVEN AND WITH A TIMID AIR IT WAS WILLIAM HE LOOKED JUST LIKE HIS MOTHER AND I HAD BEEN IMAGINING
BUT I BELIEVED THAT MISSUS TODD WOULD FIND IT INACCESSIBLE UNLESS SHE HAD OCCASION TO SEEK ME IN GREAT HASTE I WROTE ON FEELING LIKE A BESIEGED MISER OF TIME WHILE THE FOOTSTEPS CAME NEARER
WE MADE WHAT SPEED WE COULD TO GET CLEAR OF HUDSON'S BAY AND OFF THE COAST I OWNED AN EIGHTH OF THE VESSEL AND HE OWNED A SIXTEENTH OF HER SHE WAS A FULL RIGGED SHIP CALLED THE MINERVA BUT SHE WAS GETTING OLD AND LEAKY
AND SOME WHO DIED IN THE WAR MOST OF THE HOME GRAVES WERE THOSE OF WOMEN WE COULD SEE NOW THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENT FOOTPATHS FROM ALONG SHORE AND ACROSS COUNTRY
WHICH WAS BUT THE REFLECTED LIGHT FROM HER BEAMING COUNTENANCE IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT I WAS FULL OF WONDER AT THE WASTE OF HUMAN ABILITY IN THIS WORLD AS A BOTANIST WONDERS AT THE WASTEFULNESS OF NATURE THE THOUSAND SEEDS THAT DIE
BUT WE COULD HEAR THE NOISE OF THE WATER ON A BEACH BELOW IT SOUNDED LIKE THE STRANGE WARNING WAVE THAT GIVES NOTICE OF THE TURN OF THE TIDE
AND WHEN THEY GOT HOME THEY STAYED THERE AND HAD SOME PRIDE IN IT
THAT OUR FAMILY CAME OF VERY HIGH FOLKS IN FRANCE AND ONE OF EM WAS A GREAT GENERAL IN SOME O THE OLD WARS I SOMETIMES THINK THAT SANTIN'S ABILITY HAS COME WAY DOWN FROM THEN TAIN'T NOTHIN HE'S EVER ACQUIRED
AND LIKE'S NOT THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN SAW IT WITH THEM
WHILE EVERYBODY CROWDED ROUND TO GIVE THEIR WELCOME MOTHER'S ALWAYS THE QUEEN SAID MISSUS TODD YES THEY'LL ALL MAKE EVERYTHING OF MOTHER SHE'LL HAVE A LOVELY TIME TO DAY I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD HER MISS IT
IT WAS A LONG TIME AFTER THIS
I WISH THEY WERE SITTIN WITH US THEY'RE NOT AMONG FOLKS THEY CAN PARLEY WITH AN THEY LOOK DISAPPOINTED AS THE FEAST WENT ON THE SPIRITS OF MY COMPANION STEADILY ROSE
NO SANTIN NEVER WAS IN THE WAR SAID MISSUS TODD WITH LOFTY INDIFFERENCE IT WAS A CAUSE OF REAL DISTRESS TO HIM HE KEP ENLISTIN AND TRAVELED FAR AN WIDE ABOUT HERE AN EVEN TOOK THE BO'T
HE PICKED A FEW SPRIGS OF LATE BLOOMING LINNAEA AS WE CAME OUT UPON AN OPEN BIT OF PASTURE AT THE TOP OF THE ISLAND AND GAVE THEM TO ME WITHOUT SPEAKING BUT HE KNEW AS WELL AS I THAT ONE COULD NOT SAY HALF HE WISHED ABOUT LINNAEA
AND THEY'D BEEN TREATED TO A SERMON ON FAITH AN WORKS FROM OLD FAYTHER HARLOW THAT NEVER KNOWS WHEN TO CEASE TWA'N'T NO TIME FOR TACTICS THEN THEY WA'N'T A'THINKIN OF THE CHURCH MILITARY SANT
THE GREATER PART OF MY LIFE FORTY THREE YEARS IN ALL YOU MAY NOT THINK IT BUT I AM ABOVE EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE
I COULD PLAINLY HEAR HER GREET HIM GOT ROUND TO COMIN IN DIDN'T YOU SHE INQUIRED WITH AMUSEMENT WELL NOW THAT'S CLEVER DIDN'T KNOW'S I SHOULD SEE YOU TO DAY WILLIAM AN I WANTED TO SETTLE AN ACCOUNT
IN ALL THESE THERE WERE STRAGGLING PROCESSIONS WALKING IN SINGLE FILE LIKE OLD ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS THERE WAS A CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE AS IF HUGE BEES WERE SWARMING IN THE LILAC BUSHES
WAS ALL SETTING IN MEETING A DREADFUL HOT SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND A SCATTER WITTED LITTLE BOUND GIRL CAME RUNNING TO THE MEETIN' HOUSE DOOR ALL OUT O BREATH FROM SOMEWHERES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD MIS BOWDEN MIS BOWDEN
BUT WITH A GRAND MILITARY SORT OF COURTESY AND BORE HIMSELF WITH SOLEMN DIGNITY OF IMPORTANCE WE WERE SORTED OUT ACCORDING TO SOME CLEAR DESIGN OF HIS OWN AND STOOD AS SPEECHLESS AS A TROOP TO AWAIT HIS ORDERS
THERE WAS A THICK GROWTH OF DARK PINES AND FIRS WITH AN OCCASIONAL MAPLE OR OAK THAT GAVE A GLEAM OF COLOR LIKE A BRIGHT WINDOW IN THE GREAT ROOF ON THREE SIDES WE COULD SEE THE WATER SHINING BEHIND THE TREE TRUNKS
THAT WHEN YOU CALL UPON THE BOWDENS YOU MAY EXPECT MOST FAMILIES TO RISE UP BETWEEN THE LANDING AND THE FAR END OF THE BACK COVE THOSE THAT AREN'T KIN BY BLOOD ARE KIN BY MARRIAGE
BUT I LISTENED RESPECTFULLY WHILE HE EXPLAINED THE WINDS HAVING BECOME CONTRARY AND TALKED ON IN A DREARY SORT OF WAY ABOUT HIS VOYAGE THE BAD WEATHER AND THE DISADVANTAGES HE WAS UNDER IN THE LIGHTNESS OF HIS SHIP WHICH BOUNCED ABOUT LIKE A CHIP IN A BUCKET
ANSWERED MISSUS TODD HE'S A GOOD SIGHT BETTER COMPANY THOUGH DREAMY THAN SUCH SORDID CREATUR'S AS MARI HARRIS LIVE AND LET LIVE SAID DEAR OLD MISSUS BLACKETT GENTLY I HAVEN'T SEEN THE CAPTAIN FOR A GOOD WHILE
THIS WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM MISSUS TODD'S USUAL LARGENESS OF MIND THAT I HAD A MOMENT'S UNEASINESS BUT THE CLOUD PASSED QUICKLY OVER HER SPIRIT AND WAS GONE WITH THE OFFENDER
HEADIN FOR HUDSON'S STRAITS I HAD A BAD TURN O SOME SORT O FEVER AND HAD TO STAY BELOW THE DAYS WERE GETTING SHORT AND WE MADE GOOD RUNS ALL WELL ON BOARD BUT ME
AND LENDS SOME BEAUTY TO THE PLAINEST FACE OH I EXPECT I SHALL MEET FRIENDS TODAY THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN IN A LONG WHILE SAID MISSUS BLACKETT WITH DEEP SATISFACTION
I VIEW IT IN ADDITION THAT A COMMUNITY NARROWS DOWN AND GROWS DREADFUL IGNORANT WHEN IT IS SHUT UP TO ITS OWN AFFAIRS AND GETS NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD
HE DON'T OFTEN HAVE SUCH A CHANCE TO SHOW OFF HIS GIFTS SAID MISSUS CAPLIN A FRIEND FROM THE LANDING WHO HAD JOINED US THAT'S SANT BOWDEN HE ALWAYS TAKES THE LEAD SUCH DAYS
I'VE VISITED IT TIME AN AGAIN JUST TO NOTICE ITS POOR BLOOMS TIS A REAL SANT BOWDEN OUT OF ITS OWN PLACE MISSUS CAPLIN LOOKED BEWILDERED AND BLANK WELL ALL I KNOW IS
AND THE OLD HOUSE AND ITS LILACS STANDING PLACIDLY IN THE SUN AND THE GREAT BARN WITH A STOCKADE OF CARRIAGES FROM WHICH TWO OR THREE CARE TAKING MEN WHO HAD LINGERED WERE COMING ACROSS THE FIELD TOGETHER
SO HE KEPT IT OVER MY MOTHER WAS THERE AND SHE THOUGHT CERTAIN TWAS ME NONE OF OUR FAMILY WAS EVER SUBJECT TO FITS INTERRUPTED MISSUS TODD SEVERELY NO
HE'LL KNOW YOU NEED HIM FOR SOMETHING PARTICULAR AN THEN WE CAN CALL TO HIM AS HE COMES UP THE PATH I WON'T PUT HIM TO NO PAIN MISSUS BLACKETT'S OLD FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME
STEALING A GLANCE AT ME THERE'S ONE THING CERTAIN THERE'S NOTHING TAKES IN THIS WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE ANYTHING RELATED TO THE BOWDENS YES I DO FEEL
I COULD FEEL THAT MISSUS TODD'S EYES WERE UPON US AS WE APPROACHED THE HOUSE AND ALTHOUGH I FELL BEHIND IN THE NARROW PATH AND LET WILLIAM TAKE THE BASKET ALONE AND PRECEDE ME AT SOME LITTLE DISTANCE THE REST OF THE WAY
SUCH WAS THE INNOCENCE AND SIMPLICITY OF THE MOMENT THAT WHEN I HEARD MISSUS TODD LAUGHING BEHIND US IN THE KITCHEN I LAUGHED TOO BUT WILLIAM DID NOT EVEN BLUSH I THINK HE WAS A LITTLE DEAF AND HE STEPPED ALONG
THESE BICYCLES OFFEND ME DREADFULLY THEY DON'T AFFORD NO REAL OPPORTUNITIES OF EXPERIENCE SUCH AS A MAN GAINED ON A VOYAGE NO WHEN FOLKS LEFT HOME IN THE OLD DAYS THEY LEFT IT TO SOME PURPOSE
WITH ALMOST VOLCANIC LIGHT AND HEAT IN QUIET NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH INWARD FORCE DOES NOT WASTE ITSELF UPON THOSE PETTY EXCITEMENTS OF EVERY DAY THAT BELONG TO CITIES
AS IF HE HAD SUFFERED FROM LONELINESS AND MISAPPREHENSION HE LOOKED WITH HIS CAREFUL PRECISION OF DRESS AS IF HE WERE THE OBJECT OF CHERISHING CARE ON THE PART OF ELDERLY UNMARRIED SISTERS
TWILL BRING OUT A GOOD MANY OF THE OLD FOLKS TIS SUCH A LOVELY DAY I'M ALWAYS GLAD NOT TO HAVE THEM DISAPPOINTED
SHOWED ME THE STONE WALLED BURYING GROUND THAT STOOD LIKE A LITTLE FORT ON A KNOLL OVERLOOKING THE BAY BUT AS SHE SAID THERE WERE PLENTY OF SCATTERED BOWDENS WHO WERE NOT LAID THERE SOME LOST AT SEA AND SOME OUT WEST
TO THE POETS I WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH A SHIPMASTER THAT WAS ALL FOR BEES AN BEEKEEPIN AND IF YOU MET HIM IN PORT AND WENT ABOARD HE'D SIT
AN I NEVER COULD HEAR OF NO OTHER ON THIS COAST I HAD A LARGE BUNCH BROUGHT ME ONCE FROM MASSACHUSETTS WAY SO I KNOW IT THIS PIECE GROWS IN AN OPEN SPOT WHERE YOU'D THINK TWOULD DO WELL BUT IT'S SORT O POOR LOOKIN
AND LIFTED MISSUS BLACKETT DOWN FROM THE HIGH WAGON LIKE A CHILD AND KISSED HER WITH HEARTY AFFECTION I WAS MASTER AFRAID SHE WOULDN'T BE HERE HE SAID LOOKING AT MISSUS TODD WITH A FACE LIKE A HAPPY SUNBURNT SCHOOLBOY
THERE NEVER WAS A MORE GENEROUS OUT OF DOOR FEAST ALONG THE COAST THEN THE BOWDEN FAMILY SET FORTH THAT DAY TO CALL IT A PICNIC WOULD MAKE IT SEEM TRIVIAL
THE SKY THE SEA HAVE WATCHED POOR HUMANITY AT ITS RITES SO LONG WE WERE NO MORE A NEW ENGLAND FAMILY CELEBRATING ITS OWN EXISTENCE AND SIMPLE PROGRESS
THERE SUDDENLY CAME SILENCE AND ORDER I SAW THE STRAIGHT SOLDIERLY LITTLE FIGURE OF A MAN WHO BORE A FINE RESEMBLANCE TO MISSUS BLACKETT AND WHO APPEARED TO MARSHAL US WITH PERFECT EASE HE WAS IMPERATIVE ENOUGH
THEY CARED FOR NOTHING AND IDLED ME INTO A FIT OF SICKNESS BUT MY FIRST MATE WAS A GOOD EXCELLENT MAN WITH NO MORE IDEA OF BEING FROZEN IN THERE UNTIL SPRING THAN I HAD SO
YOUR BABY'S IN A FIT THEY USED TO TELL THAT THE WHOLE CONGREGATION WAS UP ON ITS FEET IN A MINUTE AND RIGHT OUT INTO THE AISLES ALL THE MIS BOWDENS WAS SETTING RIGHT OUT FOR HOME
THE BIRDS FLEW UP OUT OF THE THICK SECOND CROP OF CLOVER AND THE BEES HUMMED
INSISTED MISSUS TODD WITH SOME EXCITEMENT
THEN WE MOVED EASILY TOWARD THE HOUSE TOGETHER SPEAKING OF THE FINE WEATHER AND OF MACKEREL WHICH WERE REPORTED TO BE STRIKING IN ALL ABOUT THE BAY WILLIAM HAD BEEN OUT SINCE THREE O'CLOCK AND HAD TAKEN AN EXTRA FARE OF FISH
WHICH THE BOYS AND GIRLS MADE WE BROUGHT FLOWERS FROM THE FENCE THICKETS OF THE GREAT FIELD AND OUT OF THE DISORDER OF FLOWERS AND PROVISIONS SUDDENLY APPEARED AS ORDERLY A SCHEME FOR THE FEAST AS THE MARSHAL HAD SHAPED FOR THE PROCESSION
RIGHT FROM THE SCRIPTURE MEASUREMENTS SAME'S OTHER SAILORS MAKE LITTLE SHIPS AND DESIGN NEW TRICKS OF RIGGING
HAS SUCH A POWER OF SURVIVAL THAT I FELT ALL THE TIME AS IF ONE MUST TRY TO MAKE THE OCCASION EASY FOR SOME ONE WHO WAS YOUNG AND NEW TO THE AFFAIRS OF SOCIAL LIFE HE ASKED POLITELY IF I WOULD LIKE TO GO UP TO THE GREAT LEDGE
THAT ANY OCCASION OF GENERAL INTEREST PROVES TO BE LESS THAN GREAT SUCH IS THE HIDDEN FIRE OF ENTHUSIASM IN THE NEW ENGLAND NATURE THAT ONCE GIVEN AN OUTLET IT SHINES FORTH
A GREAT BARK HE COMMANDED FOR MANY YEARS TUTTLE'S BEEHIVE THERE WAS OLD CAP'N JAMESON HE HAD NOTIONS OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE AND MADE A VERY HANDSOME LITTLE MODEL OF THE SAME
OUT OF THE CHATTERING CROWD OF NOISY CHILDREN AND LARGE WAISTED WOMEN WHOSE BEST BLACK DRESSES FELL STRAIGHT TO THE GROUND IN GENEROUS FOLDS AND SUNBURNT MEN WHO LOOKED AS SERIOUS AS IF IT WERE TOWN MEETING DAY
SHE STOOD UP IN THE HIGH WAGON TO SEE EVERYTHING AND WHEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN SHE TOOK FAST HOLD OF MY HAND HADN'T YOU BETTER URGE THE HORSE A LITTLE ALMIRY SHE ASKED HE'S HAD IT EASY AS WE CAME ALONG
I TOLD HIM ONCE THE COUNTRY'D LOST A GREAT GENERAL AN I MEANT IT TOO I EXPECT YOU'RE NEAR RIGHT SAID MISSUS CAPLIN A LITTLE CRESTFALLEN AND APOLOGETIC I BE RIGHT INSISTED MISSUS TODD WITH MUCH
WHO PRESENTLY HAD HER COURT INSIDE THE HOUSE WHILE MISSUS TODD LARGE HOSPITABLE AND PREEMINENT WAS THE CENTRE OF A RAPIDLY INCREASING CROWD ABOUT THE LILAC BUSHES
ON THIS NORTHERN COAST OF NEW ENGLAND WERE OF HUGUENOT BLOOD AND THAT IT IS THE NORMAN ENGLISHMAN NOT THE SAXON WHO GOES ADVENTURING TO A NEW WORLD THEY USED TO SAY IN OLD TIMES SAID MISSUS TODD MODESTLY
WERE FAMILIAR THINGS THE MINISTERS AND MISSUS BLACKETT WITH A FEW OF THEIR RANK AND AGE WERE PUT IN PLACES OF HONOR AND FOR ONCE THAT I LOOKED ANY OTHER WAY I LOOKED TWICE AT MISSUS BLACKETT'S FACE
WILLIAM MISSUS TODD HAD TAKEN THE ONION OUT OF HER BASKET AND LAID IT DOWN UPON THE KITCHEN TABLE THERE'S JOHNNY BOWDEN COME WITH US YOU KNOW SHE REMINDED HER MOTHER HE'LL BE HUNGRY ENOUGH TO EAT HIS SIZE
THAT HE WAS LARGE AND STOUT LIKE HIS SISTER ALMIRA TODD AND STRANGE TO SAY MY FANCY HAD LED ME TO PICTURE HIM NOT FAR FROM THIRTY AND A LITTLE LOUTISH IT WAS NECESSARY INSTEAD TO PAY WILLIAM THE RESPECT DUE TO AGE
EXCLAIMED MISSUS TODD WITH UNAFFECTED DELIGHT AND THESE KINDRED SPIRITS MET AND PARTED WITH THE PROMISE OF A GOOD TALK LATER ON AFTER THIS
AND SOME WERE GREAT ON MEDICINE
I TOLD HIM I NEVER COULD LIKE HER MYSELF SAID HE YOU SHA'N'T BE BOTHERED DEAR HE SAYS AN TWAS ONE O THE THINGS THAT MADE ME SET A GOOD DEAL BY NATHAN
AT LAST TO TURN OUT OF THE STONY HIGHROAD INTO A GREEN LANE SHADED WITH OLD APPLE TREES MISSUS TODD ENCOURAGED THE HORSE UNTIL HE FAIRLY PRANCED WITH GAYETY AS WE DROVE ROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE ON THE SOFT TURF
I DO TRY TO REMEMBER THAT SHE'S NATHAN'S COUSIN OH DEAR WELL SHE'S GONE BY AFTER ALL AN AIN'T SEEN ME I EXPECTED SHE'D COME PLEASANTIN ROUND JUST TO SHOW OFF AN SAY AFTERWARDS SHE WAS ACQUAINTED
I REMEMBER THE DAY I PROMISED TO NATHAN HOW IT COME OVER ME
AN IT SEEMED AS IF DIE I SHOULD POOR NATHAN SAW SOMETHIN HAD CROSSED ME HE HAD VERY NICE FEELINGS
CONFERENCE IN PLATOONS AND GOT EM ALL FLUSTERED UP TRYIN TO SENSE HIS IDEAS OF A HOLLER SQUARE SHE BURST FORTH
HE COULDN'T DO NOTHIN WITH EM ALL HE THINKS OF WHEN HE SEES A CROWD IS HOW TO MARCH EM TIS ALL VERY WELL WHEN HE DON'T TEMPT TOO MUCH HE NEVER DID ACT LIKE OTHER FOLKS
AND WHEN I MADE PORT AT LAST IT WAS TOO LATE TO DELAY IN THOSE NORTHERN WATERS WITH SUCH A VESSEL AND SUCH A CREW AS I HAD
ONE OF THE GREATEST DISCOVERIES THAT MAN HAS EVER MADE NOW WE WERE APPROACHING DANGEROUS GROUND BUT A SUDDEN SENSE OF HIS SUFFERINGS AT THE HANDS OF THE IGNORANT CAME TO MY HELP AND I ASKED TO HEAR MORE WITH ALL THE DEFERENCE I REALLY FELT
MISSUS TODD HAD TAKEN OFF HER WARM GLOVES AND LOOKED THE PICTURE OF CONTENT THERE SHE EXCLAIMED I'VE ALWAYS MEANT TO HAVE YOU SEE THIS PLACE BUT I NEVER LOOKED FOR SUCH A BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY
WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF GROWING WORSE SHE HAD WRITTEN TO MISSUS ARMSTRONG TELLING HER NOTHING BUT THAT ARNOLD'S LEGITIMATE CHILD WAS AT RICHFIELD AND IMPLORING HER TO RECOGNIZE HIM SHE WAS DYING THE BOY WAS AN ARMSTRONG
THE DETECTIVE SAT IN ABSOLUTE DARKNESS ON THE LOWER STEP OF THE STAIRS DOZING HE SAID AFTERWARDS NOW AND THEN NOTHING COULD PASS HIM IN EITHER DIRECTION AND THE DOOR IN THE MORNING REMAINED AS SECURELY FASTENED AS IT HAD BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
WHEN WARNER MARRIED ROSIE LIDDY SNIFFED AND SAID WHAT I TOOK FOR FAITHFULNESS IN ROSIE HAD BEEN NOTHING BUT MAWKISHNESS I HAVE NOT YET OUTLIVED LIDDY'S CONTEMPT BECAUSE I GAVE THEM SILVER KNIVES AND FORKS AS A WEDDING GIFT
IT WAS IN RESPONSE TO ONE BAILEY HAD SENT AND IT SAID THAT PAUL ARMSTRONG WAS VERY ILL BAILEY WAS ALMOST DESPERATE HE DECIDED TO GO WEST AND FIND PAUL ARMSTRONG AND TO FORCE HIM TO DISGORGE
AND BY NIGHT SHE WAS AT SUNNYSIDE UNDER GERTRUDE'S PARTICULAR CARE WHILE HER MOTHER HAD GONE TO BARBARA FITZHUGH'S WHAT HALSEY SAID TO MISSUS ARMSTRONG I NEVER KNEW BUT THAT HE WAS CONSIDERATE AND CHIVALROUS I FEEL CONFIDENT IT WAS HALSEY'S WAY ALWAYS WITH WOMEN
AND I SCARCELY KNEW HOW TO ACCOUNT FOR IT TO ME MISTER JAMIESON WAS FAR LESS FORMIDABLE UNDER MY EYES WHERE I KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING
THE DOOR TO THE BASEMENT STAIRS WAS DOUBLE BARRED AND HAD A TABLE PUSHED AGAINST IT AND BESIDE HER ON THE TABLE WAS MOST OF THE KITCHEN PARAPHERNALIA DID YOU SEE IF THERE WAS ANY ONE MISSING IN THE HOUSE I ASKED IGNORING THE ARRAY OF SAUCE PANS ROLLING PINS AND THE POKER OF THE RANGE
BUT AS IT HAPPENS IT WAS IF ANY SUCH CASE COMES TO YOU WILL IT BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE FOR YOU TO LET ME KNOW
SHE HEARD A SOUND AS SHE WENT DOWN THE CORRIDOR
YES SHE COULD COOK WAS NOT A FANCY COOK BUT COULD MAKE GOOD SOUPS AND DESSERTS IF THERE WAS ANY ONE TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE SALADS AND SO IN THE END I TOOK HER AS HALSEY SAID WHEN WE TOLD HIM
BUT THE CATASTROPHE AT THE BANK OCCURRED SOONER THAN HE HAD EXPECTED ON THE MOMENT OF STARTING WEST AT ANDREWS STATION WHERE MISTER JAMIESON HAD LOCATED THE CAR HE READ THAT THE BANK HAD CLOSED AND GOING BACK SURRENDERED HIMSELF
HE HAD GROWN INTO A BEAUTIFUL BOY AND HE WAS ALL ANNE HAD TO LIVE FOR THE ARMSTRONGS LEFT FOR CALIFORNIA AND ARNOLD'S PERSECUTIONS BEGAN ANEW HE WAS FURIOUS OVER THE CHILD'S DISAPPEARANCE
IN AN EXTREMITY OF ANXIETY ABOUT ME THAT OLD THOMAS HAD SEEN HIS MASTER AND THOUGHT HE HAD SEEN THE SUNNYSIDE GHOST THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT
AND MAYBE IT WASN'T BUT I KNOW THIS I'VE GOT SOME FEELINGS LEFT AND TO SEE YOU STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THAT STAIRCASE SHOOTIN THROUGH THE DOOR I'LL NEVER BE THE SAME WOMAN AGAIN WELL I'M GLAD OF THAT
I WATCHED GERTRUDE'S BRIGHT COLOR SLOWLY EBBING AWAY AND AROUND MY OWN HEART I SEEMED TO FEEL THE GRASP OF A GIANT HAND TWENTY FIVE MINUTES AND THEN A SOUND BUT IT WAS NOT THE CHUG OF THE MOTOR
AND IN VIEW OF MY REFUSAL TO GIVE UP THE HOUSE
TO AVOID ROUSING SUSPICION THEN I CAN WATCH FOR AT LEAST A PART OF EACH NIGHT AND PROBABLY MISTER INNES WILL HELP US OUT I WOULD SAY AS LITTLE TO THOMAS AS POSSIBLE THE OLD MAN KNOWS MORE THAN HE IS WILLING TO ADMIT
SHE SLIPPED DOWN QUIETLY AND OPENED THE DOOR
BUT THE IRON GATES ONCE CLOSED AND TENDED BY THE LODGE KEEPER NOW STOOD PERMANENTLY OPEN THE DAY OF THE MOTOR CAR HAD COME NO ONE HAD TIME FOR CLOSED GATES AND LODGE KEEPERS THE LODGE AT SUNNYSIDE WAS MERELY A SORT OF SUPPLEMENTARY SERVANTS QUARTERS IT WAS AS CONVENIENT IN ITS APPOINTMENTS AS THE BIG HOUSE AND INFINITELY MORE COZY
ROSIE INSISTED SHE HAD GONE UP STAIRS TO GET A PICTURE FROM HER ROOM TO SHOW MARY ANNE A PICTURE OF A LADY MARY ANNE INTERPOSED SHE WENT UP THE SERVANTS STAIRCASE AND ALONG THE CORRIDOR TO HER ROOM WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE TRUNK ROOM AND THE UNFINISHED BALL ROOM
WE MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO REDOUBLE OUR VIGILANCE AS TO WINDOWS AND DOORS THAT NIGHT HALSEY WAS INCLINED TO POOH POOH THE WHOLE AFFAIR HE SAID A BREAK IN THE PLASTER MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED MONTHS AGO AND GONE UNNOTICED
BUT BEFORE THAT IN THE TIME OF ANDERSON THE OLD CASHIER WHO HAD DIED MUCH STRANGE JUGGLING HAD BEEN DONE WITH THE RECORDS THE RAILROAD IN NEW MEXICO HAD APPARENTLY DRAINED THE BANKER'S PRIVATE FORTUNE AND HE DETERMINED TO RETRIEVE IT BY ONE STROKE
TOOK A NAP ALL RIGHT I SAID GO ON
EVERY INSTANT IS PRECIOUS MISTER JAMIESON I HAVE REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT HE IS IN DANGER BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ONLY HE MUST BE FOUND
SHE CLUTCHED AT MY SLEEVE WHEN I WENT CLOSE TO HER AND REFUSED TO LET GO
AND YET EVERY WAY I TURNED I SEEMED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT POINTED TO SUCH A CONNECTION
ANYTHING FOR A CHANGE I SAID AND IN CAME ELIZA FLANKED BY ROSIE AND MARY ANNE HER STORY BROKEN WITH SOBS AND CORRECTIONS FROM THE OTHER TWO WAS THIS AT TWO O'CLOCK TWO FIFTEEN
AN ATTACK OF HEART DISEASE A BODY FROM A MEDICAL COLLEGE DISSECTING ROOM SHIPPED IN A TRUNK TO DOCTOR WALKER BY A COLLEAGUE IN SAN FRANCISCO AND PALMED OFF FOR THE SUPPOSED DEAD BANKER WHAT WAS SIMPLER THE WOMAN NINA CARRINGTON WAS THE COG THAT SLIPPED
COMING JUST AFTER THE FIRE THE HOUSEHOLD WAS DEMORALIZED AND IT WAS NO SURPRISE TO ME TO FIND ALEX AND THE UNDER GARDENER STRUGGLING DOWN STAIRS WITH A HEAVY TRUNK BETWEEN THEM
BEING QUITE CONFIDENT THAT THE GAP WAS OF UNHOLY ORIGIN SHE DID NOT CONCERN HERSELF WITH SUCH TRIFLES AS A BIT OF MORTAR AND LATH NO DOUBT THEY WERE EVEN THEN HEAPED NEATLY ON A GRAVESTONE IN THE CASANOVA CHURCHYARD
BUT IT CAME UP UNPLEASANTLY ENOUGH LATER AT SIX O'CLOCK THE BODY WAS TAKEN AWAY AND AT SEVEN THIRTY AFTER AN EARLY DINNER MISTER HARTON WENT
CHAPTER SEVEN A SPRAINED ANKLE I WAS PANIC STRICKEN AS I RAN ALONG THE CORRIDOR I WAS CONFIDENT THAT THE MYSTERIOUS INTRUDER AND PROBABLE MURDERER HAD BEEN FOUND AND THAT HE LAY DEAD OR DYING AT THE FOOT OF THE CHUTE I GOT DOWN THE STAIRCASE SOMEHOW AND THROUGH THE KITCHEN TO THE BASEMENT STAIRS
AND THEN HE THREW THE BOLT BACK COME OUT
BUT I SHRANK FROM A DEATH BED
BECOMING AN OBJECT OF SUSPICION THERE IS LITTLE IN THE PAPER ITSELF HE ADMITTED
HE WAS COMPLETELY BUT SOMEWHAT INCONGRUOUSLY DRESSED AND HIS OPEN BOYISH FACE LOOKED ABASHED
A SOFT HAT LAY BESIDE IT AND THE COLLAR OF THE DINNER COAT WAS STILL TURNED UP THE HANDSOME DISSIPATED FACE OF ARNOLD ARMSTRONG PURGED OF ITS UGLY LINES WAS NOW ONLY PATHETIC AS WE WENT IN MISSUS WATSON APPEARED AT THE CARD ROOM DOOR
HIS FACE CHANGED AND STIFFENED HE WAS ON HIS GUARD AGAIN IN A MOMENT
NOW HOWEVER HE WENT QUICKLY TOWARD THE DOOR I'LL CATCH THE HACK DOWN THE ROAD AND HOLD IT HE SAID IS THE GENTLEMAN DOWN IN THE TOWN MISTER JAMIESON LOUISE SAID IMPULSIVELY I CAN USE THE HACK
SHE WORE NOTHING BUT A STOCKING ON HER RIGHT FOOT AND IN SPITE OF THE UNLOCKED DOOR SHE ESCAPED BY THE WINDOW AND AGAIN I THOUGHT OF GERTRUDE'S SPRAINED ANKLE
THAT HE MIGHT MEET LOUISE DRIVING OVER THE HILLS IN HER RUNABOUT POSSIBLY HE DID MEET HER OCCASIONALLY BUT FROM HIS CONTINUED GLOOM I FELT SURE THE SITUATION BETWEEN THEM WAS UNCHANGED
HE WENT UP TO THE EAST ENTRY AND IN THE BILLIARD ROOM GAVE THE CASHIER WHAT HE HAD REFUSED EARLIER IN THE EVENING THE ADDRESS OF PAUL ARMSTRONG IN CALIFORNIA AND A TELEGRAM WHICH HAD BEEN FORWARDED TO THE CLUB FOR BAILEY FROM DOCTOR WALKER
HE DID HE ABSOLUTELY DISAPPEARED IN THE DUSK WITHOUT MY GETTING MORE THAN A GLIMPSE OF HIS FACE I HAD A VAGUE IMPRESSION OF UNFAMILIAR FEATURES AND OF A SORT OF CAP WITH A VISOR THEN HE WAS GONE I WENT TO THE LODGE AND RAPPED
FULLY TWO YARDS BY HER MEASURE SHOT THROUGH THAT HOLE AND TUMBLED ON THE BED
HERE WAS I RACHEL INNES SPINSTER A GRANDDAUGHTER OF OLD JOHN INNES OF REVOLUTIONARY DAYS A D A R A COLONIAL DAME MIXED UP WITH A VULGAR AND REVOLTING CRIME AND EVEN ATTEMPTING TO HOODWINK THE LAW
I SAID SHARPLY COME DOWN WITH US AND TURN ON ALL THE LIGHTS SHE OFFERED HER RESIGNATION AS USUAL ON THE SPOT BUT I TOOK HER BY THE ARM AND SHE CAME ALONG FINALLY SHE SWITCHED ON ALL THE LIGHTS AND POINTED TO A DOOR JUST AHEAD THAT'S THE DOOR SHE SAID SULKILY
NO DOUBT I SAID ABSENTLY MISTER HARTON I AM GOING TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS AND I HOPE YOU WILL ANSWER THEM
IN ITS PEACEFUL SUNDAY AFTERNOON CALM AND FAR DOWN THE DRIVE MISTER JAMIESON WAS WALKING SLOWLY STOOPING NOW AND THEN AS IF TO EXAMINE THE ROAD WHEN I WENT BACK MISTER HARTON WAS FURTIVELY WIPING HIS EYES
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO HARROWING PERIOD FOR ALL OF US WITH THE BOY IN DANGER BUT YOUNG PEOPLE REFUSE TO PROFIT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF THEIR ELDERS AND SOMETIMES THE ELDERS ARE THE ONES TO SUFFER
AND THAT THE DUST HAD PROBABLY BEEN STIRRED UP THE DAY BEFORE AFTER ALL WE HAD TO LET IT GO AT THAT BUT WE PUT IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE SUNDAY GERTRUDE WENT TO CHURCH AND HALSEY TOOK A LONG WALK IN THE MORNING
AND ALMOST A HUNDRED DOLLARS THE MONEY WAS FOR LUCIEN'S BOARD UNTIL SHE RECOVERED
THEN MORE LIGHTLY WHY YOU AND LIDDY NEED ME TO ARBITRATE BETWEEN YOU EVERY DAY IN THE WEEK PERHAPS I WAS GROWING SUSPICIOUS OF EVERY ONE
AS I WENT DOWN THE DRIVE MY THOUGHTS WERE BUSY WHO WOULD IT BE THAT MISTER JAMIESON HAD TRAPPED IN THE CELLAR WOULD WE FIND A BODY OR SOME ONE BADLY INJURED SCARCELY EITHER WHOEVER HAD FALLEN HAD BEEN ABLE TO LOCK THE LAUNDRY DOOR ON THE INSIDE IF THE FUGITIVE HAD COME FROM OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
IT WAS DIFFERENT WITH THE YOUNG WIFE HOWEVER SHE DROOPED AND FRETTED AND ON THE BIRTH OF HER BABY BOY SHE HAD DIED
AS THE YEARS WENT ON HE FORCED MONEY FROM ANNE WATSON INSTEAD UNTIL SHE WAS ALWAYS PENNILESS THE LOWER ARNOLD SANK IN THE SCALE THE HEAVIER HIS DEMANDS BECAME WITH THE RUPTURE BETWEEN HIM AND HIS FAMILY THINGS WERE WORSE
IN SUPPORT OF HER STORY SHE CARRIED IN MY WET AND MUDDY BOOTS
I HAVE BEEN TO THE CLUB HOUSE HE SAID AND AMONG MISTER ARMSTRONG'S EFFECTS I FOUND THESE ONE IS CURIOUS THE OTHER IS PUZZLING THE FIRST WAS A SHEET OF CLUB NOTE PAPER ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN OVER AND OVER THE NAME HALSEY B INNES
IT WAS HALSEY'S FLOWING SIGNATURE TO A DOT BUT IT LACKED HALSEY'S EASE THE ONES TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE SHEET WERE MUCH BETTER THAN THE TOP ONES MISTER JAMIESON SMILED AT MY FACE HIS OLD TRICKS HE SAID
TO CLOSING IT FOR THE NIGHT SAM BOHANNON CAME AT A QUARTER BEFORE NINE AND BEGAN HIS PATROL OF THE GROUNDS AND WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE TWO DETECTIVES TO LOOK FORWARD TO
THERE ARE PLENTY OF WALLACES AROUND BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY LUCIEN I WAS AS CERTAIN AS POSSIBLE THAT HE DID PEOPLE DO NOT LIE READILY TO ME AND THIS MAN LIED BEYOND A DOUBT
AND WE TRIED THAT AT CASANOVA STATION
JOHN BAILEY HAD KNOWN PAUL ARMSTRONG INTIMATELY HE DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE MONEY WAS GONE IN FACT IT WAS HARDLY POSSIBLE IN THE INTERVAL SINCE THE SECURITIES HAD BEEN TAKEN WHERE WAS IT
WITH THIS REMARKABLE INSIGHT OF YOURS I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME
BETWEEN ONE O'CLOCK AND DAYLIGHT THERE WAS NONE UNTIL SIX A M THE NEXT QUESTION REQUIRED MORE DIPLOMACY DID YOU NOTICE ON THE SIX O'CLOCK TRAIN ANY PERSON
I WENT UP TO THE TRUNK ROOM WHICH WAS DIRECTLY OVER MY BEDROOM THE PLAN OF THE UPPER STORY OF THE HOUSE WAS LIKE THAT OF THE SECOND FLOOR IN THE MAIN ONE END HOWEVER OVER THE EAST WING HAD BEEN LEFT ONLY ROUGHLY FINISHED
I ASKED UNCEREMONIOUSLY IGNORING THE STRANGER DID HE NOT MEET YOU NO MISTER JAMIESON LOOKED SLIGHTLY SURPRISED I RATHER EXPECTED THE CAR BUT WE GOT UP ALL RIGHT YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM AT ALL
AND WHICH WAS MEANT TO BE A COUP BUT THINGS WENT SO FAST THERE WAS NO TIME TO CARRY IT INTO EFFECT THE FIRST THING THAT OCCURRED WAS A MESSAGE FROM THE CHARITY HOSPITAL THAT MISSUS WATSON WAS DYING AND HAD ASKED FOR ME
HE PLAYED A FAIR GAME OF CRIBBAGE BUT HE CHEATED AT SOLITAIRE THE NIGHT THE DETECTIVE ARRIVED SATURDAY I HAD A TALK WITH HIM I TOLD HIM OF THE EXPERIENCE LOUISE ARMSTRONG HAD HAD THE NIGHT BEFORE ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE GAINED NOW HIS DEFENSES WERE UP AND I LEFT HALF IRRITATED AND WHOLLY BAFFLED
FLINDERS WAS CERTAINLY NOT A COMMON NAME FOR A HORSE AND YET THE YOUNGSTER AT RICHFIELD
BUT I GUESS I CAN'T STAND IT ANY LONGER MY TRUNK'S PACKED WHO PACKED IT I ASKED EXPECTING FROM HER TONE TO BE TOLD SHE HAD WAKENED TO FIND IT DONE BY SOME GHOSTLY HAND I DID MISS RACHEL YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THIS HOUSE IS
SIT DOWN I SAID GRIMLY HAVE YOU FOUND A CLUE THAT WILL INCRIMINATE ME MISTER JAMIESON HE HAD THE GRACE TO LOOK UNCOMFORTABLE NO HE SAID IF YOU HAD KILLED MISTER ARMSTRONG YOU WOULD HAVE LEFT NO CLUES
BUT LIDDY CLENCHED THAT JUST ASK ALEX SHE SAID WHEN HE PUT THE NEW COOK'S TRUNK THERE LAST NIGHT THE WALL WAS AS SMOOTH AS THIS THIS MORNING IT'S DUG OUT AND THERE'S PLASTER ON THE COOK'S TRUNK MISS RACHEL
AND ENTITLED TO HIS FATHER'S SHARE OF THE ESTATE THE PAPERS WERE IN HER TRUNK AT SUNNYSIDE
HE HAD BEEN STAYING AT THE CLUB HOUSE ACROSS THE VALLEY FOR THE LAST WEEK JARVIS TELLS ME BUT THAT ONLY EXPLAINS HOW HE CAME HERE NOT WHY IT IS A MOST UNFORTUNATE FAMILY HE SHOOK HIS HEAD DESPONDENTLY
OPENED FROM A LONG CORRIDOR LIKE THAT ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND IN THE TRUNK ROOM AS LIDDY HAD SAID WAS A FRESH BREAK IN THE PLASTER
AND I WENT I LEFT MISTER JAMIESON AND THE DAY DETECTIVE GOING OVER EVERY INCH OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE POUNDING PROBING AND MEASURING
AND I RIPPED OUT A PERFECTLY GOOD SCALLOP BEFORE I ANSWERED WHY DID I STEP INTO THE TULIP BED I ASKED WITH INTEREST YOU PICKED UP SOMETHING HE SAID GOOD HUMOREDLY WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO TELL ME ABOUT LATER
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE A VISIT FROM LOUISE THAT DAY WAS DESTINED TO BE AN EVENTFUL ONE FOR WHEN I ENTERED THE HOUSE AND FOUND ELIZA ENSCONCED IN THE UPPER HALL ON A CHAIR WITH MARY ANNE DOING HER BEST
IT'S LOCKED ON THE INSIDE HE SAID IN A LOW TONE
SUNNYSIDE IS FOR SALE NO I SHALL NOT BUY IT LITTLE LUCIEN ARMSTRONG IS LIVING WITH HIS STEP GRANDMOTHER AND SHE IS RECOVERING GRADUALLY FROM TROUBLES THAT HAD EXTENDED OVER THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF HER SECOND MARRIAGE
MISTER JAMIESON HAD BEEN BEFORE ME AND THE DOOR STOOD OPEN LIDDY WAS STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE KITCHEN HOLDING A FRYING PAN BY THE HANDLE AS A WEAPON DON'T GO DOWN THERE SHE YELLED WHEN SHE SAW ME MOVING TOWARD THE BASEMENT STAIRS
ABOVE HER PLAIN BLACK GOWN HER EYES LOOKED BIG AND SOMBER AND THE RAPID DRIVE HAD BROUGHT NO COLOR TO HER FACE I GOT UP AND DREW FORWARD A CHAIR HE HAS NOT COME BACK I SAID QUIETLY SIT DOWN CHILD
BAILEY FELT SURE THERE WAS A HIDDEN ROOM AT SUNNYSIDE HE TRIED TO SEE THE ARCHITECT OF THE BUILDING BUT LIKE THE CONTRACTOR
SHE SAID ACCUSINGLY I BELIEVE YOU KNOW THIS WHOLE HORRIBLE THING THIS MYSTERY THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HALSEY I SHALL NEVER FORGIVE YOU
TO SEE LOUISE SHE ASKED NO I WANT TO ASK THIS YOUNG WALKER SOMETHING SHE WAS CURIOUS I KNEW
WHEN THE DOOR HAD CLOSED AND LOUISE REALIZED THAT HALSEY HAD NOT COME HER EXPRESSION CHANGED FROM TENSE WATCHFULNESS TO RELIEF AND NOW AGAIN TO ABSOLUTE DESPAIR HER FACE WAS AN OPEN PAGE
LAY MISSUS WATSON SHE WAS VERY WEAK AND SHE ONLY OPENED HER EYES AND LOOKED AT ME WHEN I SAT DOWN BESIDE HER I WAS CONSCIENCE STRICKEN
SHE WENT UP STAIRS HARDLY KNOWING WHAT SHE WAS DOING GERTRUDE'S DOOR WAS OPEN
IT WAS VERY MUCH OF A DISAPPOINTMENT I HAD EXPECTED A SECRET ROOM AT THE VERY LEAST AND I THINK EVEN MISTER JAMIESON HAD FANCIED HE MIGHT AT LAST HAVE A CLUE TO THE MYSTERY THERE WAS EVIDENTLY NOTHING MORE TO BE DISCOVERED
BUT WE SHALL PROBABLY FIND HIM SEND WARNER FOR THE CAR BUT THEY DID NOT FIND HIM AT FOUR O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING
YES I SAID LISTEN THERE IS THE WHISTLE OF THE TRAIN NOW SHE RELAXED A LITTLE AT OUR MATTER OF FACT TONE AND ALLOWED HERSELF TO SINK INTO A CHAIR PERHAPS I WAS WRONG SHE SAID HEAVILY HE
BUT SHE LOOKED IN THE TRUNK ROOM AND SAW NOBODY SHE WENT INTO HER ROOM QUIETLY THE NOISE HAD CEASED AND EVERYTHING WAS QUIET THEN SHE SAT DOWN ON THE SIDE OF HER BED AND FEELING FAINT
INDEED FOR A TIME HE DID SO THEN HE REALIZED THAT LUCIEN WAS THE RULING PASSION IN THIS LONELY WOMAN'S LIFE HE FOUND OUT WHERE THE CHILD WAS HIDDEN AND THREATENED TO TAKE HIM AWAY ANNE WAS FRANTIC THE POSITIONS BECAME REVERSED
AN EXPLANATION OF HOW THE FUGITIVE HAD ESCAPED INJURY WAS FOUND IN A HEAPED UP BASKET OF CLOTHES UNDER THE CHUTE THE BASKET HAD BEEN OVERTURNED BUT THAT WAS ALL MISTER JAMIESON EXAMINED THE WINDOWS ONE WAS UNLOCKED AND OFFERED AN EASY ESCAPE
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TOO MUCH INTELLIGENCE
IT HAS COLLIDED WITH A FREIGHT CAR ON THE SIDING ABOVE THE STATION
SO IT WAS ALEX JACK BAILEY WHO HAD BEEN OUR GHOST NOT ONLY HAD HE ALARMED LOUISE AND HIMSELF HE ADMITTED ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE BUT HE HAD DUG THE HOLE IN THE TRUNK ROOM WALL AND LATER SENT ELIZA INTO HYSTERIA
CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR THE ODDS AND ENDS OF DOCTOR WALKER'S SENSATIONAL ESCAPE THAT NIGHT TO SOUTH AMERICA OF THE RECOVERY OF OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND SECURITIES IN THE SAFE FROM THE CHIMNEY ROOM
I WAS MUCH USED UP THE DAY AFTER THE FIRE AND GERTRUDE INSISTED ON MY GOING OUT THE MACHINE WAS TEMPORARILY OUT OF COMMISSION AND THE CARRIAGE HORSES HAD BEEN SENT TO A FARM FOR THE SUMMER
THE VERY TELLING OF IT SEEMED TO RELIEVE THE DYING WOMAN
AT HALF PAST NINE I HEARD THE SOUND OF A HORSE DRIVEN FURIOUSLY UP THE DRIVE IT CAME TO A STOP IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THERE WERE HURRIED STEPS ON THE VERANDA OUR
THE KEY'S IN IT BUT THE KEY WAS NOT IN IT MISTER JAMIESON SHOOK IT BUT IT WAS A HEAVY DOOR WELL LOCKED AND THEN HE STOOPED AND BEGAN PUNCHING AROUND THE KEYHOLE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL WHEN HE STOOD UP HIS FACE WAS EXULTANT
SOME ONE HAD BEEN SHOT BY THE BULLET THAT WENT THROUGH THE DOOR HE HAD NOT LEFT THE VILLAGE AND HE HAD NOT CALLED IN A PHYSICIAN ALSO
IN ANSWER SHE POINTED TO THE NEW COOK'S TRUNK THAT NECESSARY ADJUNCT OF THE MIGRATORY DOMESTIC THE TOP WAS COVERED WITH FINE WHITE PLASTER AS WAS THE FLOOR BUT THERE WERE NO LARGE PIECES OF MORTAR LYING AROUND NO BITS OF LATHING
HALSEY SAT ON THE RAIL WITH A PIPE OPENLY WATCHING LOUISE AS SHE LOOKED BROODINGLY ACROSS THE VALLEY TO THE HILLS THERE WAS SOMETHING BAFFLING IN THE GIRL'S EYES AND GRADUALLY HALSEY'S BOYISH FEATURES
AS IT TURNED OUT I DID SURPRISE THEM ALMOST INTO SPASMS I DROVE FROM THE TRAIN TO THE CHARITY HOSPITAL AND WAS AT ONCE TAKEN TO A WARD
WHEN HE GOT HIS BREATH THEY CERTAINLY LOOK LIKE IT
THEY'RE YOURS MISS RACHEL AND COVERED WITH MUD AND SOAKED TO THE TOPS
AND HELD THEM OUT TO THE DETECTIVE AND MYSELF
I SEEN THERE WASN'T MUCH MORE TO DO ANYHOW AT THE FIRE WE'D GOT THE FLAMES UNDER CONTROL GERTRUDE LOOKED AT ME AND SMILED SO I STARTED DOWN THE HILL
I SPOKE INSTEAD OF AN ANSWER WHOEVER IT WAS TURNED AND RAN UP I FOLLOWED IT WAS DARK BUT AS I TURNED THE CORNER AT THE TOP A FIGURE DARTED THROUGH THIS DOOR AND CLOSED IT
LOST THEIR GLOW AT SEEING HER ABOUT AGAIN AND SETTLED INTO GRIM LINES HE WAS LIKE HIS FATHER JUST THEN WE SAT UNTIL LATE AFTERNOON HALSEY GROWING MORE AND MORE MOODY SHORTLY BEFORE SIX HE GOT UP
HE DUG HIS FORK INTO MY DAMASK CLOTH AND DID NOT HEAR WHEN HE WAS SPOKEN TO HE REFUSED DESSERT AND LEFT THE TABLE EARLY EXCUSING HIMSELF ON THE GROUND THAT HE WANTED TO SEE ALEX
WE PUT LOUISE IN A STEAMER CHAIR AND SHE SAT THERE PASSIVELY ENOUGH HER HANDS CLASPED IN HER LAP WE WERE VERY SILENT
I SHALL DREAM OF IT TO NIGHT GET UP FLINDERS
THIS WAS NOTHING LESS THAN THE LOOTING OF THE BANK'S SECURITIES TURNING THEM INTO MONEY AND MAKING HIS ESCAPE BUT THE LAW HAS LONG ARMS PAUL ARMSTRONG EVIDENTLY STUDIED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY JUST AS THE ONLY GOOD INDIAN IS A DEAD INDIAN
PRANCING CURLY HAIRED LITTLE HORSE FLINDERS
ROSIE IS A PRETTY YOUNG GIRL AND PERHAPS SHE HAS A SWEETHEART IT WILL BE A GOOD THING IF SHE HAS THE MAIDS STAY MUCH BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HOLD THEM HERE GERTRUDE HAD GONE BACK TO HER ROOM AND WHILE I WAS DRINKING MY CUP OF HOT TEA
AT HALF AFTER NINE GROWING WEARY OF MY OWN COMPANY I WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO FIND THE YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE DOOR OF THE LIVING ROOM I PAUSED GERTRUDE AND JACK HAD RETURNED AND WERE THERE SITTING TOGETHER ON A DIVAN WITH ONLY ONE LAMP LIGHTED THEY DID NOT SEE OR HEAR ME
TWISTING CIRCUMSTANCES AND MOTIVES TO SUIT HIMSELF AND LEARNING WHAT HE WISHED TO KNOW ABOUT EVENTS AT SUNNYSIDE IN SOME OCCULT WAY I WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO HAVE HIM THERE WHEN EXCITEMENTS BEGAN TO COME THICK AND FAST
WHEN YOU HAVE WASHED YOUR FACE AND STOPPED BAWLING I SAID COME INTO MY SITTING ROOM AND TELL ME WHAT HAS HAPPENED LIDDY PUT AWAY MY THINGS WITHOUT SPEAKING THE VERY SET OF HER SHOULDERS EXPRESSED DISAPPROVAL
TAKE SERVANTS ON FAITH I NO LONGER DEMANDED WRITTEN AND UNIMPEACHABLE REFERENCES I
GERTRUDE AND I DRANK SOME HOME MADE ELDERBERRY WINE AND TOLD BRIEFLY OF THE FIRE OF THE MORE SERIOUS PART OF THE NIGHT'S EXPERIENCE OF COURSE WE SAID NOTHING
MISTER JAMIESON HAD HEARD SOME ONE THERE PURSUED SHE HAD FLED MADLY ANYWHERE THROUGH THE FIRST DOOR SHE CAME TO SHE HAD FALLEN DOWN THE CLOTHES CHUTE AND BEEN SAVED BY THE BASKET BENEATH I COULD HAVE CRIED WITH RELIEF
AS TO SEND THE ROD FLYING ON TO HER BED I HAD GONE UP STAIRS ALONE AND I CONFESS THE THING PUZZLED ME IN TWO OR THREE PLACES IN THE WALL SMALL APERTURES HAD BEEN MADE NONE OF THEM OF ANY DEPTH
I SUGGESTED THAT ALEX THE GARDENER WOULD PROBABLY BE WILLING TO HELP AND MISTER JAMIESON UNDERTOOK TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENT FOR ONE NIGHT HOWEVER MISTER JAMIESON PREFERRED TO WATCH ALONE APPARENTLY NOTHING OCCURRED
IT WAS HALSEY'S IDEA THAT JOHN BAILEY COME TO THE HOUSE AS A GARDENER AND PURSUE HIS INVESTIGATIONS AS HE COULD HIS SMOOTH UPPER LIP HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT DISGUISE WITH HIS CHANGE OF CLOTHES AND A HAIR CUT BY A COUNTRY BARBER
THE WINDOW OR THE DOOR WHICH WAY HAD THE FUGITIVE ESCAPED THE DOOR SEEMED MOST PROBABLE AND I HOPED IT HAD BEEN SO I COULD NOT HAVE BORNE JUST THEN TO THINK THAT IT WAS MY POOR GERTRUDE WE HAD BEEN HOUNDING THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND YET
NOT THE LEAST MYSTERIOUS THING WAS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE IRON IMPLEMENT THAT HAD BEEN USED I REMEMBERED A STORY I READ ONCE ABOUT AN IMPISH DWARF THAT LIVED IN THE SPACES BETWEEN THE DOUBLE WALLS OF AN ANCIENT CASTLE
THE SECOND MISSUS ARMSTRONG HAD BEEN A WIDOW WITH A CHILD A LITTLE GIRL THIS CHILD NOW PERHAPS TWENTY WAS LOUISE ARMSTRONG HAVING TAKEN HER STEPFATHER'S NAME AND WAS AT PRESENT IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE FAMILY
I TRIED TO PUT THE THOUGHT AWAY BUT IT WOULD NOT GO IF GERTRUDE HAD BEEN ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE THAT NIGHT WHY HAD SHE FLED FROM MISTER JAMIESON THE IDEA PUZZLING AS IT WAS SEEMED BORNE OUT BY THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WHOEVER HAD TAKEN REFUGE AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS
THE NOTE LIDDY HAD FOUND IN GERTRUDE'S SCRAP BASKET WAS FROM HIM AND IT WAS HE WHO HAD STARTLED ME INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS BY THE CLOTHES CHUTE AND WITH GERTRUDE'S HELP HAD CARRIED ME TO LOUISE'S ROOM GERTRUDE I LEARNED HAD WATCHED ALL NIGHT BESIDE ME
WE WERE IN THE UPPER HALL NOW
THEN IT HAD NOT BEEN GERTRUDE AFTER ALL THAT WAS THE STORY
OUR EARS WERE STRAINED FOR THE FIRST THROB OF THE MOTOR AS IT TURNED INTO THE DRIVE AND COMMENCED THE CLIMB TO THE HOUSE TEN MINUTES PASSED FIFTEEN TWENTY I SAW LOUISE'S HANDS GROW RIGID AS THEY CLUTCHED THE ARMS OF HER CHAIR
I PROMISED TO LOOK AFTER LITTLE LUCIEN AND SAT WITH HER UNTIL THE INTERVALS OF CONSCIOUSNESS GREW SHORTER AND FINALLY CEASED ALTOGETHER
DON'T MAKE ME LEAVE NOW YOU ARE LOSING YOUR HEALTH AND YOUR GOOD LOOKS I SAID DECIDEDLY YOU SHOULD HAVE A CHANGE I SHAN'T STIR A FOOT SHE WAS EQUALLY DECIDED
THE NIGHT LIDDY AND I HEARD THE NOISE ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE THAT TOO WAS RIGHT ON THE NIGHT BEFORE ARNOLD ARMSTRONG WAS MURDERED JACK BAILEY HAD MADE HIS FIRST ATTEMPT TO SEARCH FOR THE SECRET ROOM
WHEN THE MESSAGE CAME TO COME UP FOR TWO GIRLS AND THEIR TRUNKS I SUPPOSED THERE WAS SOMETHING DOING AND AS THIS HERE WOMAN HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR WORK IN THE VILLAGE I THOUGHT I'D BRING HER ALONG ALREADY I HAD ACQUIRED THE TRUE SUBURBANITE ABILITY TO
GERTRUDE I SAID
THAT ONE IS MERELY CURIOUS THIS ONE AS I SAID BEFORE IS PUZZLING
ONE WAS A SHORT FELLOW
ON THE CENTER TABLE OPEN WAS A SEALSKIN TRAVELING BAG IT WAS FILLED WITH GOLD TOPPED BOTTLES AND BRUSHES AND IT BREATHED OPULENCE LUXURY FEMININITY FROM EVERY INCH OF SURFACE
BUT SHE WAS SO EXCITED I WAS AFRAID SHE WOULD DO AS SHE SAID DRAG IT DOWN HERSELF AND SCRATCH THE STAIRCASE I WAS TRYING TO GET MY BONNET OFF AND TO KEEP THE MAIDS QUIET AT THE SAME TIME NOW ELIZA
AND GERTRUDE ALWAYS APPREHENSIVE LATELY WAS AT THE DOOR ALMOST INSTANTLY A MOMENT LATER LOUISE HAD BURST INTO THE ROOM AND STOOD THERE BAREHEADED AND BREATHING HARD WHERE IS HALSEY SHE DEMANDED
THE INTENTION HAVING BEEN TO CONVERT IT INTO A BALL ROOM AT SOME FUTURE TIME
I'M DOING MY BEST TO FIND OUT I SAID WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU DRIVING AT SHE DREW A LONG BREATH THERE IS A HOLE IN THE TRUNK ROOM WALL DUG OUT SINCE LAST NIGHT
TO BE PERFECTLY FRANK MISS INNES
TO OUR AMAZED INVESTIGATIONS MARY ANNE AND ELIZA LEFT THAT AFTERNOON BUT ROSIE DECIDED TO STAY IT WAS ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK WHEN THE HACK CAME FROM THE STATION TO GET THEM AND TO MY AMAZEMENT IT HAD AN OCCUPANT
WE WERE ONLY MEASURING WEAPONS THEN HE SMILED A LITTLE AND GOT UP
SUNNYSIDE WITH ITS HOARD IN THE CHIMNEY ROOM HAD BEEN RENTED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE ATTEMPTS TO DISLODGE ME HAVING FAILED HE WAS DRIVEN TO BREAKING INTO HIS OWN HOUSE THE LADDER IN THE CHUTE THE BURNING OF THE STABLE AND THE ENTRANCE THROUGH THE CARD ROOM WINDOW
AND SOMEWHAT GUARDEDLY HAD TOLD HIM OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S EVENTS MISTER JAMIESON PROMISED TO COME OUT THAT NIGHT AND TO BRING ANOTHER MAN WITH HIM I DID NOT CONSIDER IT NECESSARY TO NOTIFY MISSUS ARMSTRONG IN THE VILLAGE NO DOUBT SHE KNEW OF THE FIRE
I BROUGHT MISTER JAMIESON UP TO SEE THE HOLE IN THE WALL DIRECTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HIS EXPRESSION WAS VERY ODD WHEN HE LOOKED AT IT AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHAT OBJECT IF ANY SUCH A HOLE COULD HAVE
IT BELONGS TO THOMAS HE SAID AND FLED UP THE DRIVE TO THOMAS A LONDON BAG WITH MIRRORS AND COSMETIC JARS OF WHICH THOMAS COULD NOT EVEN HAVE GUESSED THE USE
IN DEPTH THE SPACE EXTENDED ONLY TO THE FLOORING THE BREACH HAD BEEN MADE ABOUT FOUR FEET FROM THE FLOOR AND INSIDE WERE ALL THE MISSING BITS OF PLASTER IT HAD BEEN A METHODICAL GHOST
THEN HE TURNED THE HANDLE WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST DIFFICULTY THE DOOR OPENED REVEALING THE BLACKNESS OF THE DRYING ROOM BEYOND MISTER JAMIESON GAVE AN EXCLAMATION OF DISGUST GONE HE SAID
ANNE WATSON LIES NOT FAR FROM THE MAN SHE KILLED AND WHO AS SURELY CAUSED HER DEATH THOMAS THE FOURTH VICTIM OF THE CONSPIRACY IS BURIED ON THE HILL WITH NINA CARRINGTON FIVE LIVES WERE SACRIFICED IN THE COURSE OF THIS GRIM CONSPIRACY
WHERE CAN I FIND HIM FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE LOUISE GERTRUDE BURST OUT TELL US WHAT IS WRONG
AND THE PRINT OF A FOOT IN A TULIP BED AND A NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS THE ODDEST PART IS MISS INNES THAT THE THUMB MARK IS PROBABLY YOURS AND THE FOOTPRINT CERTAINLY HIS AUDACITY WAS THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED ME HIS AMUSED SMILE PUT ME ON MY METTLE
I WENT UP THE WALK TO THE HOUSE WHERE A BRASS SIGN AT THE SIDE ANNOUNCED THE OFFICE AND WENT IN THE RECEPTION ROOM WAS EMPTY BUT FROM THE CONSULTING ROOM BEYOND CAME THE SOUND OF TWO VOICES NOT VERY AMICABLE
I THOUGHT I'D DIE SOMETHIN HIT ME ON THE FACE AND I SET UP SUDDEN AND THEN I SEEN THE PLASTER DROP DROPPIN FROM A LITTLE HOLE IN THE WALL AND THE FIRST THING I KNEW AN IRON BAR THAT LONG
IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE THE CREAKING VEHICLE CAME TO A STOP AT THE DOOR LOUISE ROSE AND STOOD WATCHING HER HAND TO HER THROAT AND THEN GERTRUDE OPENED THE DOOR ADMITTING MISTER JAMIESON AND A STOCKY MIDDLE AGED MAN
MADAME SWEENY HAD BOTCHED HER NEW GOWN WHEN I FINISHED LIDDY WAS BEHIND ME HER MOUTH A THIN LINE I WISH YOU WOULD TRY TO LOOK CHEERFUL LIDDY I GROANED YOUR FACE WOULD SOUR MILK
WAS NOT TO BE FOUND IT WAS AFTER EIGHT WHEN HALSEY ORDERED THE CAR AND STARTED DOWN THE HILL AT A PACE THAT EVEN FOR HIM WAS UNUSUALLY RECKLESS SHORTLY AFTER ALEX REPORTED THAT HE WAS READY TO GO OVER THE HOUSE PREPARATORY
I HAD MET GERTRUDE NOT FAR FROM THAT VERY WINDOW I WENT UP STAIRS AT LAST TIRED AND DEPRESSED MISSUS WATSON AND LIDDY WERE MAKING TEA IN THE KITCHEN IN CERTAIN WALKS OF LIFE THE TEA POT IS THE REFUGE IN TIMES OF STRESS TROUBLE OR SICKNESS
SHOT HE SAID BLESS MY SOUL NO
AND I BEAT A HASTY RETREAT TO THE LIBRARY BUT HERE AGAIN I WAS DRIVEN BACK LOUISE WAS SITTING IN A DEEP CHAIR LOOKING THE HAPPIEST I HAD EVER SEEN HER WITH HALSEY ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR HOLDING HER CLOSE IT WAS NO PLACE FOR AN ELDERLY SPINSTER
HE IS ALWAYS LATE ANY MOMENT WE MAY HEAR THE CAR COMING UP THE ROAD BUT IT DID NOT COME AFTER A HALF HOUR OF SUSPENSE LOUISE WENT OUT QUIETLY AND DID NOT COME BACK I HARDLY KNEW SHE WAS GONE
FROM THE DAY MISTER JAMIESON CAME TO SUNNYSIDE THERE WAS A SUBTLE CHANGE IN GERTRUDE'S MANNER TO ME IT WAS ELUSIVE DIFFICULT TO ANALYZE BUT IT WAS THERE
WE FORGET LIDDY SNIFFED
THE WALL MUST BE AT LEAST SIX INCHES THICK I SAID WITH ASPERITY UNLESS THE PERSON WHO DRILLED THE HOLE CARRIED HIS EYES ON THE ENDS OF A STICK ELIZA COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE SEEN THEM BUT THE FACT REMAINED
AND SHE PUT THE BOY IN AN EPISCOPALIAN HOME AND SECURED THE POSITION OF HOUSEKEEPER TO THE ARMSTRONGS THERE SHE FOUND LUCIEN'S FATHER THIS TIME UNDER HIS OWN NAME IT WAS ARNOLD ARMSTRONG
AND EARN GOOD SALARIES IN A CONGENIAL OCCUPATION
I ASKED AT LAST DIDN'T YOU SLEEP LAST NIGHT
HOW DID HE GET IN IF IT WAS SOME MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHO COULD IT HAVE BEEN AND THEN A FEELING OF HORROR ALMOST OVERWHELMED ME GERTRUDE GERTRUDE AND HER INJURED ANKLE GERTRUDE FOUND LIMPING SLOWLY UP THE DRIVE WHEN I HAD THOUGHT SHE WAS IN BED
THEN I THINK HE HAD A REVOLVER BUT I AM NOT SURE HE STEPPED ASIDE AND THREW THE DOOR OPEN FROM WHERE I STOOD I COULD NOT SEE BEYOND THE DOOR BUT I SAW MISTER JAMIESON'S FACE CHANGE AND HEARD HIM MUTTER SOMETHING THEN HE BOLTED DOWN THE STAIRS THREE AT A TIME
AT DAYLIGHT I DROPPED INTO EXHAUSTED SLEEP HALSEY HAD NOT COME BACK
AND YET ONE OF THE MOST INEXPLICABLE OCCURRENCES OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR TOOK PLACE THAT VERY NIGHT LIDDY CAME TO MY ROOM ON SUNDAY MORNING WITH A FACE AS LONG AS THE MORAL LAW SHE LAID OUT MY THINGS AS USUAL
HE DENIED THE WHOLE THING AND SHE WENT TO HALSEY IT WAS THIS THAT HAD TAKEN HALSEY TO THE DOCTOR THE NIGHT HE DISAPPEARED HE ACCUSED THE DOCTOR OF THE DECEPTION AND CROSSING THE LAWN HAD SAID SOMETHING CRUEL TO LOUISE THEN FURIOUS AT HER APPARENT CONNIVANCE
I WATCHED HER COVERTLY DURING THE REST OF THE DRIVE
ON THE WAY ACROSS THE LAWN SHE WAS CONFRONTED BY ARNOLD WHO FOR SOME REASON WAS DETERMINED TO GET INTO THE HOUSE
IT WAS THE UNMISTAKABLE RUMBLE OF THE CASANOVA HACK GERTRUDE DREW ASIDE THE CURTAIN AND PEERED INTO THE DARKNESS IT'S THE HACK I AM SURE SHE SAID EVIDENTLY RELIEVED SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG WITH THE CAR AND NO WONDER
YOU ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THIS KIND OF THING I DON'T THINK SHE EVEN HEARD ME HE HAS NOT COME BACK SHE ASKED LOOKING FROM ME TO GERTRUDE
YOU MIGHT THINK OVER MY OFFER IN THE MEANTIME HE WENT ON THROUGH THE DRAWING ROOM AND I LISTENED TO HIS FOOTSTEPS GROWING GRADUALLY FAINTER I DROPPED MY PRETENSE AT KNITTING AND LEANING BACK I THOUGHT OVER THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS
GERTRUDE FINALLY GOT A TRAP FROM THE CASANOVA LIVERYMAN AND WE WENT OUT JUST AS WE TURNED FROM THE DRIVE INTO THE ROAD WE PASSED A WOMAN
SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS BUT LOUISE HAD BEEN IN A STATE OF TERRIBLE EXCITEMENT MISSUS WATSON TRIED TO HIDE FROM ARNOLD BUT HE WAS UGLY HE LEFT THE LODGE AND WENT UP TO THE HOUSE ABOUT TWO THIRTY WAS ADMITTED AT THE EAST ENTRANCE
RANG THAT BELL SO HARD I HADN'T TIME SCARCELY TO GET EM ON AND DID YOU SEE A MAN WHO LIMPED GERTRUDE PUT IN AS HE STOPPED FOR BREATH
GERTRUDE SPENT MUCH OF HER TIME WANDERING THROUGH THE GROUNDS OR TAKING LONG CROSS COUNTRY WALKS HALSEY PLAYED GOLF AT THE COUNTRY CLUB DAY AFTER DAY AND AFTER LOUISE LEFT AS SHE DID THE FOLLOWING WEEK
IT WAS SO EVIDENT THAT THOMAS DID NOT WANT ME INSIDE THAT I WENT IN TELL WARNER HE IS NEEDED IN A HURRY I REPEATED AND TURNED INTO THE LITTLE SITTING ROOM I COULD HEAR THOMAS GOING UP THE STAIRS COULD HEAR HIM ROUSE WARNER AND THE STEPS OF THE CHAUFFEUR AS HE HURRIEDLY DRESSED BUT MY ATTENTION WAS BUSY WITH THE ROOM BELOW
I DIDN'T GET A LOOK AT THEIR FACES BUT I KNOW EVERY CHICK AND CHILD IN THE PLACE AND EVERYBODY KNOWS ME WHEN THEY DIDN'T SHOUT AT ME IN MY UNIFORM YOU KNOW
I TRIED TO WARN HIM NONSENSE I SAID
TO STOP WITH A SHUDDER WHERE THE FLOOR SHOULD HAVE BEEN WAS BLACK VOID AND DARKNESS FROM WHICH CAME THE INDESCRIBABLE DAMP SMELL OF THE CELLARS
THE CONNIVANCE OF DOCTOR WALKER WAS SUGGESTED BY HIS LOVE FOR LOUISE THE MAN WAS UNSCRUPULOUS AND WITH THE GIRL AS A BAIT PAUL ARMSTRONG SOON HAD HIM FAST THE PLAN WAS APPARENTLY THE ACME OF SIMPLICITY A SMALL TOWN IN THE WEST
YOU NEVER LOOKED BETTER IT'S MY OPINION ALL THIS RUNNING AROUND AND GETTING JOLTED OUT OF A RUT HAS STIRRED UP THAT TORPID LIVER OF YOURS IT'S NOT MYSELF I'M THINKING ABOUT SHE SAID GOADED INTO SPEECH
LOUISE ARRIVED UNEXPECTEDLY THOMAS SENT FOR MISSUS WATSON AND THEN WENT FOR ARNOLD ARMSTRONG AT THE GREENWOOD CLUB
ONE BY ONE THEY HAD DIED AND BEEN BURIED BESIDE THEIR PARENTS IN A LITTLE TOWN IN THE MIDDLE WEST THERE WAS ONLY ONE SISTER LEFT THE BABY LUCY
WELL I SAID WHEN THE SILENCE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS SEEM TO BE WARMING UP SILENCE FROM LIDDY AND A LONG SIGH IF ELIZA GOES I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER COOK
THE SPEAKER WAS NEITHER GRACE NOR FITZPIERS BUT MARTY SOUTH WHO APPROACHED WITH HER FACE TURNED UP TO THE SKY IN HER ENDEAVOR TO TRACE THE BIRDS SUDDENLY PERCEIVING GRACE SHE EXCLAIMED OH MISS MELBURY
FITZPIERS TOO
AS THE BETROTHED OF HIS DAUGHTER HE WAS QUITE ANGRY WITH CIRCUMSTANCES FOR SO HEEDLESSLY INFLICTING ON GILES A SECOND TROUBLE
WELL YES BUT REPLIED GILES HE WENT OVER TO GRACE AND HOPED NONE OF IT HAD GONE INTO HER EYE OH NO SHE SAID ONLY A SPRINKLE ON MY FACE IT WAS NOTHING
BUT MAKING THE POINT OF EACH IVY LEAF ON THE TRUNKS SCRATCH ITS UNDERLYING NEIGHBOR RESTLESSLY GRACE'S LIPS SUCKED IN THIS NATIVE AIR OF HERS LIKE MILK THEY SOON REACHED A PLACE WHERE THE WOOD RAN DOWN INTO A CORNER
WHEN SHE SHOWED YOU HER HOUSE AND ALL HER KNICK KNACKS AND MADE YOU STAY TO TEA SO NICELY IN HER DRAWING ROOM SURELY YOU DID YES I DID SAY SO ADMITTED GRACE WAS IT TRUE YES I FELT SO AT THE TIME
MELBURY LOOKED MUCH SURPRISED NONSENSE HE SAID SHARPLY
HE KNEW THE HISTORIES OF ALL THESE WHICH GIN HAD BROKEN A MAN'S LEG WHICH GUN HAD KILLED A MAN THAT ONE I REMEMBER HIS SAYING
AS TONED BY THE SUNLIGHT AND LEAFAGE SHE HEARD A FOOT FALL CRUSHING DEAD LEAVES BEHIND HER AND FOUND HERSELF RECONNOITERED BY FITZPIERS HIMSELF APPROACHING GAY AND FRESH AS THE MORNING AROUND THEM
NOR I TO HIM YET YOU AND HE COULD SPEAK IN A TONGUE THAT NOBODY ELSE KNEW NOT EVEN MY FATHER THOUGH HE CAME NEAREST KNOWING
UNLUCKILY THE TREE WAVED AFRESH BY THIS TIME A WIND HAVING SPRUNG UP AND BLOWN THE FOG AWAY AND HIS EYES TURNED WITH ITS WAVINGS THEY HEARD FOOTSTEPS A MAN'S BUT OF A LIGHTER TYPE THAN USUAL THERE IS DOCTOR FITZPIERS AGAIN SHE SAID AND DESCENDED
MIGHT BE BOUND BY VOWS MADE WITHOUT AT THE TIME A FULL RECOGNITION OF THEIR FORCE THAT PARTICULAR SENTENCE BEGINNING WHOM GOD HATH JOINED TOGETHER WAS A STAGGERER FOR A GENTLEWOMAN OF STRONG DEVOTIONAL SENTIMENT
IT DOES NOT COME TO THAT I HAVE TITLE DEEDS MYSELF THERE THAT PIECE OF PARCHMENT REPRESENTS HOUSES IN SHERTON ABBAS YES BUT SHE HESITATED LOOKED AT THE FIRE AND WENT ON IN A LOW VOICE
AND THAT HE HAD ARRANGED TO PLANT THEM WITH HIS OWN HANDS HE HAD A MARVELLOUS POWER OF MAKING TREES GROW ALTHOUGH HE WOULD SEEM TO SHOVEL IN THE EARTH QUITE CARELESSLY
THE FLOWERS OF LATE APRIL TOOK UP A POSITION UNSEEN AND LOOKED AS IF THEY HAD BEEN BLOOMING A LONG WHILE
HOW THE DEUCE DID A SNAIL GET THERE
TO DAY HAS SHOWN ME THAT WHATEVER A YOUNG WOMAN'S NICENESS SHE STANDS FOR NOTHING ALONE YOU SHALL MARRY WELL HE BREATHED HEAVILY AND HIS BREATHING WAS CAUGHT UP BY THE BREEZE WHICH SEEMED TO SIGH A SOFT REMONSTRANCE SHE LOOKED CALMLY AT HIM
WAS WHAT SHE DID NOT FEEL THE NEED OF IT WILL PROBABLY NOT APPEAR A SURPRISING STATEMENT
OUT OF THE DIM MID DISTANCE BETWEEN THE MASSES OF BRUSHWOOD ON EITHER HAND AND IT ENLARGED AND TIM COULD HEAR THE BRUSHING OF FEET OVER THE TUFTS OF SOUR GRASS THE AIRY GAIT REVEALED FITZPIERS EVEN BEFORE HIS EXACT OUTLINE COULD BE SEEN
AS THE MUFFLED DRUM TO HIS WORLDLY MARCH
FEARING THAT THEY MIGHT ENTREAT HIM TO ABANDON SO RISKY A PROJECT AND WENT OUT UNOBSERVED HE HAD CHOSEN HIS TIME WITH A VIEW AS HE SUPPOSED OF CONVENIENTLY CATCHING MISSUS CHARMOND WHEN SHE HAD JUST FINISHED HER BREAKFAST BEFORE ANY OTHER BUSINESS PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABOUT
SHE WONDERED WHETHER GOD REALLY DID JOIN THEM TOGETHER BEFORE SHE HAD DONE DELIBERATING THE TIME OF HER ENGAGEMENT DREW NEAR AND SHE WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE ALMOST AT THE MOMENT THAT TIM TANGS RETIRED TO HIS OWN
WITH RED HOT BOWLDERS LYING ABOUT EVERYWHERE DO YOU THINK IT WENT OFF WELL CREEDLE HE ASKED THE VICTUALS DID THAT I KNOW AND THE DRINK DID THAT I STEADFASTLY BELIEVE FROM THE HOLLER SOUND OF THE BARRELS GOOD HONEST DRINK
SHE FOR THE FIRST TIME SAW THE ILLUMINED FACE OF FITZPIERS
PRESENTLY HIS TREAD WAS HEARD ON THE NAKED STAIRS MISTER FITZPIERS ENTERED THE SICK CHAMBER JUST AS A DOCTOR IS MORE OR LESS WONT TO DO ON SUCH OCCASIONS AND PRE EMINENTLY WHEN THE ROOM IS THAT OF A HUMBLE COTTAGER LOOKING ROUND TOWARDS THE PATIENT WITH THAT PREOCCUPIED GAZE
FITZPIERS SAT DOWN INSIDE THE SHELTER AND WENT ON WITH HIS READING EXCEPT WHEN HE LOOKED UP TO OBSERVE THE SCENE AND THE ACTORS THE THOUGHT THAT HE MIGHT SETTLE HERE AND BECOME WELDED IN WITH THIS SYLVAN LIFE BY MARRYING GRACE MELBURY CROSSED HIS MIND FOR A MOMENT
YOU ARE NOT DEAD YOU ARE NOT HURT THANK GOD THANK GOD HE SAID ALMOST SOBBING IN HIS DELIGHT AND RELIEF FROM THE HORROR OF HIS APPREHENSION GRACE MY WIFE MY LOVE HOW IS THIS WHAT HAS HAPPENED I WAS COMING ON TO YOU SHE SAID
THOUGH I WAS JUST THINKING WHAT A MILD DAY IT IS FOR THE SEASON NOW I WARRANT THAT COLD OF YOURS IS TWICE AS BAD AS IT WAS YOU HAD NO BUSINESS TO CHOP THAT HAIR OFF MARTY IT SERVES YOU ALMOST RIGHT LOOK HERE CUT OFF HOME AT ONCE
PRAY GOD IT IS FOR THE BEST FROM THIS HOUR THERE WAS NO SERIOUS ATTEMPT AT RECALCITRATION ON HER PART FITZPIERS KEPT HIMSELF CONTINUALLY NEAR HER DOMINATING ANY REBELLIOUS IMPULSE
HOW BE YOU GOING TO WAKE AT HALF PAST THREE ELSE
BEYOND THE ROAD WERE SOME COTTAGE ROOFS AND ORCHARDS OVER THESE ROOFS AND OVER THE APPLE TREES BEHIND
WAS COATED WITH LICHEN OF EVERY SHADE INTENSIFYING ITS LUXURIANCE WITH ITS NEARNESS TO THE GROUND
THEN A STRANGE GENTLEMAN WHO SAYS IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO GIVE HIS NAME WAS SUDDENLY ANNOUNCED I CANNOT SEE HIM WHOEVER HE MAY BE I AM NOT AT HOME TO ANYBODY
WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN TO DEFRAY SOME OF THE LATE EXPENSES OF HER CLOTHES BOARD AND EDUCATION I TOO COST A GOOD DEAL LIKE THE HORSES AND WAGONS AND CORN
DOWN WITH IT THEN AND HANG MISSUS CHARMOND SAID MISTER FITZPIERS
BUT ONLY CRUSHED THE BONE THE SIGHT OF ONE OF THESE GINS WHEN SET PRODUCED A VIVID IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS ENDOWED WITH LIFE IT EXHIBITED THE COMBINED ASPECTS OF A SHARK A CROCODILE AND A SCORPION EACH TOOTH
WITH AN AIR WHICH MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN CALLED PASSIONATE IT IS NO USE DENYING IT YOU HAVE BOUGHT A PRACTICE AT BUDMOUTH
BOTH LOOKED ATTRACTIVE AS GLASSED BACK BY THE FAITHFUL REFLECTOR BUT GRACE'S COUNTENANCE HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING MISSUS CHARMOND APPEAR MORE THAN HER FULL AGE THERE ARE COMPLEXIONS WHICH SET OFF EACH OTHER TO GREAT ADVANTAGE
SO MUCH THE BETTER I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THIS AT ALL AND I SAY IT NOT OUT OF HARSHNESS TO HIM POOR FELLOW BUT OUT OF TENDERNESS TO YOU
AND SHAPING HER WILL INTO PASSIVE CONCURRENCE WITH ALL HIS DESIRES APART FROM HIS LOVER LIKE ANXIETY TO POSSESS HER THE FEW GOLDEN HUNDREDS OF THE TIMBER DEALER READY TO HAND FORMED A WARM BACKGROUND TO GRACE'S LOVELY FACE
OR YOURS IF YOU HAD GOT HERE FIRST SAID SHE BEGINNING TO REALIZE THE WHOLE GHASTLINESS OF THE POSSIBILITY OH EDGAR
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT LIFE AND WHAT IT CAN BRING FORTH AND HOW YOU OUGHT TO ACT TO LEAD UP TO BEST ENDS OH YOU ARE AN UNGRATEFUL MAID GRACE YOU'VE SEEN THAT FELLOW GILES AND HE HAS GOT OVER YE
KNOWING HIS MISSION THE YOUNGER MAN HASTENED DOWN FROM THE COPSE AND MANAGED TO INTERCEPT THE TIMBER MERCHANT I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF THIS SIR HE SAID AND I AM OF OPINION THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO PUT OFF YOUR VISIT FOR THE PRESENT
SHE LIKED MYSTERY IN HER LIFE IN HER LOVE IN HER HISTORY
UP TO A FEW DAYS BEFORE THIS TIME THAT LADY HAD BEEN ACCOMPANIED IN HER COMINGS STAYINGS AND GOINGS BY A RELATIVE BELIEVED TO BE HER AUNT LATTERLY HOWEVER THESE TWO LADIES HAD SEPARATED
HE DESCENDED THE PATH AND LOOKED OUT AND BEHELD MARTY SOUTH DRESSED FOR OUT DOOR WORK WHY DIDN'T YOU COME MISTER WINTERBORNE SHE SAID I'VE BEEN WAITING THERE HOURS AND HOURS AND AT LAST I THOUGHT I MUST TRY TO FIND YOU
BETWEEN THEMSELVES SHE WAS IN BED AND ASLEEP NEVER MIND SAID MELBURY RETREATING INTO THE COURT I'LL STAND ABOUT HERE CHARGED SO FULLY WITH HIS MISSION HE SHRANK FROM CONTACT WITH ANYBODY
HE HAD ALSO TO HIS FURTHER SATISFACTION FOUND A SLIGHT SCAR ON HER TEMPLE AND IT WAS VERY CONVENIENT TO PUT A PIECE OF BLACK PLASTER ON THIS CONSPICUOUS PART OF HER PERSON IN PREFERENCE TO GOLD BEATER'S SKIN
OF THE FRAGILITY TO WHICH THESE HAVE DECLINED
WINTERBORNE THOUGH NOT ABSOLUTELY OUT OF HIS HOUSE AS YET RETIRED INTO THE BACKGROUND OF HUMAN LIFE AND ACTION THEREABOUT A FEAT NOT PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT OF PERFORMANCE ANYWHERE WHEN THE DOER HAS THE ASSISTANCE OF A LOST PRESTIGE GRACE THINKING THAT WINTERBORNE SAW HER WRITE MADE NO FURTHER SIGN
AND WAS HENCE DEVOID OF THOSE KNOTTY IRREGULARITIES WHICH OFTEN MEAN POWER WHILE THE DOUBLE CYMA OR CLASSICAL CURVE OF HIS MOUTH WAS NOT WITHOUT A LOOSENESS IN ITS CLOSE NEVERTHELESS EITHER FROM HIS READILY APPRECIATIVE MIEN
PROBABLY DEVISED BY THE MIDDLE NATURED SQUIRES OR THOSE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR WIVES TWO INCHES OF MERCY TWO INCHES OF CRUELTY TWO INCHES OF MERE NIP TWO INCHES OF PROBE AND SO ON
AND GRACE BEING A FEW STEPS IN ADVANCE HE ADDRESSED HER ASKING IF SHE HAD SEEN THE FOX
WHEN IT WAS DUSK AND THE CURTAINS DRAWN WINTERBORNE DIRECTED A COUPLE OF WOODMEN TO BRING A CROSSCUT SAW AND THE TALL THREATENING TREE WAS SOON NEARLY OFF AT ITS BASE HE WOULD NOT FELL IT COMPLETELY THEN ON ACCOUNT OF THE POSSIBLE CRASH BUT NEXT MORNING BEFORE SOUTH WAS AWAKE
MAN WHO TOOK MUCH PLEASURE IN DEALING WITH HOUSE PROPERTY IN HIS SMALL WAY SINCE ONE OF THE SOUTHS STILL SURVIVED THERE WAS NOT MUCH DOUBT THAT GILES COULD DO WHAT HIS FATHER HAD LEFT UNDONE AS FAR AS HIS OWN LIFE WAS CONCERNED THIS POSSIBILITY CHEERED HIM MUCH
WILL YOU COME ALONG AND WITHOUT LINGERING LONGER SHE TOOK HOLD OF MARTY'S ARM AND LED HER AWAY THEY WENT BETWEEN THE SPECTRAL ARMS OF THE PEELED TREES AS THEY LAY AND ONWARD AMONG THE GROWING TREES BY A PATH WHERE THERE WERE NO OAKS AND NO BARKING AND NO FITZPIERS
AND MANY THINGS OF WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROUD BUT IT HAD NEVER BEEN FATHOMED BY THE HONEST MINDS OF HINTOCK AND SHE RARELY VOLUNTEERED HER EXPERIENCES AS FOR HER CAPRICIOUS NATURE THE PEOPLE ON HER ESTATES GREW ACCUSTOMED TO IT
NO INDEED IF YOU DIDN'T SAY SO TIS SO THEN NOW HERE ARE PAPERS OF ANOTHER SORT THEY ARE FOR DIFFERENT SUMS IN THE THREE PER CENTS NOW THESE ARE PORT BREEDY HARBOR BONDS WE HAVE A GREAT STAKE IN THAT HARBOR YOU KNOW BECAUSE I SEND OFF TIMBER THERE
BUT THERE WERE PREPARATIONS IMAGINABLE READILY ENOUGH BY THOSE WHO HAD SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE REMOTE AND FASHIONABLE TOWN OF SANDBOURNE SOMETHING WAS GROWING UP UNDER THE HANDS OF SEVERAL PERSONS WHO HAD NEVER SEEN GRACE MELBURY
MISSUS CHARMOND HAD FIRST RUSHED INTO A MOOD OF INDIGNATION ON COMPREHENDING MELBURY'S STORY HOT AND COLD BY TURNS SHE HAD MURMURED LEAVE ME LEAVE ME BUT AS HE SEEMED TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF THIS HIS WORDS BEGAN TO INFLUENCE HER
BUT WHO KNOWS OF THE ENGAGEMENT AS YET HOW CAN BREAKING IT DISGRACE YOU MELBURY THEN BY DEGREES ADMITTED THAT HE HAD MENTIONED THE ENGAGEMENT
THERE WAS NO GETTING OVER THAT AND OUGHT SHE ANY LONGER TO KEEP HIM AT A DISTANCE HIS SUAVE DEFERENCE TO HER LIGHTEST WHIM ON THE QUESTION OF HIS COMINGS AND GOINGS WHEN AS HER LAWFUL HUSBAND HE MIGHT SHOW A LITTLE INDEPENDENCE
AND MADE REMARKS TO EACH OTHER AS THEY WATCHED ITS ENTRANCE MELBURY STOOD AT THE DOOR OF THE TIMBER SHED IN THE ATTITUDE OF A MAN TO WHOM SUCH AN ARRIVAL WAS A TRIFLING DOMESTIC DETAIL WITH WHICH HE DID NOT CONDESCEND TO BE CONCERNED
THE TRUE ASPECT OF A MISTRESS IN HER LOVER'S REGARD MISS MELBURY HE SAID SUDDENLY I DIVINE THAT THIS VIRTUOUS MAN YOU MENTION HAS BEEN REFUSED BY YOU SHE COULD DO NO OTHERWISE THAN ADMIT IT
PROBABLY HE ONLY GAVE IT TO ME IN THE ARROGANCE OF HIS SKILL TO SHOW THE GREATNESS OF HIS RESOURCES BESIDE MINE AS ELIJAH DREW DOWN FIRE FROM HEAVEN
GRACE SAID NOTHING NOW
FAR BEYOND THOSE OF ANY OTHER NATIVE OF THE VILLAGE WOULD CONDUCE TO THE FLIGHT OF HER FUTURE INTERESTS ABOVE AND AWAY FROM THE LOCAL LIFE WHICH WAS ONCE TO HER THE MOVEMENT OF THE WORLD NEVERTHELESS HE HAD HER FATHER'S PERMISSION TO WIN HER IF HE COULD
AS I DON'T CARE TO SELL HER I SHOULD LIKE
OH YES SAID GRACE I AM ALMOST SURE THEY WOULD BE VERY GLAD YOU ARE SO ACCOMPLISHED I HEAR I SHOULD BE QUITE HONORED BY SUCH INTELLECTUAL COMPANY
MORE PERHAPS THAN WINTERBORNE HIMSELF
READING IT SLOWLY THROUGH SHE BECAME QUITE APPALLED AT HER RECENT OFF HANDEDNESS WHEN SHE REDISCOVERED WHAT AWFULLY SOLEMN PROMISES SHE HAD MADE HIM AT THOSE
ACCORDING TO MENANDER OR SOME OLD GREEK POET AND TO NOBODY WAS ONE EVER MORE SO THAN TO MELBURY BY REASON OF HER VERY DEARNESS TO HIM AS FOR GRACE SHE BEGAN TO FEEL TROUBLED
FITZPIERS BESTOWED A REGULATION THOUGHT ON THE ADVANTAGEOUS MARRIAGE HE WAS BOUND TO MAKE WITH A WOMAN OF FAMILY AS GOOD AS HIS OWN AND OF PURSE MUCH LONGER BUT AS AN OBJECT OF CONTEMPLATION FOR THE PRESENT AS OBJECTIVE SPIRIT RATHER THAN CORPOREAL PRESENCE
I URGED HER ON AND SHE MARRIED HIM BUT MA'AM A FATAL MISTAKE WAS AT THE ROOT OF MY RECKONING I FOUND THAT THIS WELL BORN GENTLEMAN I HAD CALCULATED ON SO SURELY WAS NOT STANCH OF HEART AND THAT THEREIN LAY A DANGER OF GREAT SORROW FOR MY DAUGHTER
HE WOULD REACH THE TRAP A GOOD HALF MINUTE BEFORE SHE COULD REACH THE SAME SPOT BUT HERE A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE CAME IN TO ESCAPE THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF BEING WATCHED OR LISTENED TO BY LURKERS NATURALLY CURIOUS BY REASON OF THEIR STRAINED RELATIONS THEY HAD ARRANGED
WHICH WAS BY NO MEANS AN IMPOSSIBILITY AND JUSTIFIES ANY AMOUNT OF ALARM
ACCORDING TO SCHLEIERMACHER THEY ARE SELF CONTROL PERSEVERANCE WISDOM AND LOVE AND HIS IS THE BEST LIST THAT I KNOW I AM AFRAID POOR
FOR AN INTERMINABLE GAME IN WHICH A LUMP OF CHALK WAS INCESSANTLY USED A GAME THOSE TWO ALWAYS PLAYED WHEREVER THEY WERE TAKING A SOLITARY CANDLE AND GOING TO A PRIVATE TABLE IN A CORNER
CORRECTIVES AND REGULATIONS FRAMED THAT SOCIETY MAY TEND TO PERFECTION
THE EFFECT THOUGH NOT MIRACULOUS WAS REMARKABLE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR SHE FELT CALMER COOLER BETTER ABLE TO REFLECT LESS INCLINED TO FRET AND CHAFE AND WEAR HERSELF AWAY SHE TOOK A FEW DROPS MORE
WINTERBORNE WELCOMED HIM BY A WORD AND A LOOK AND WENT ON WITH HIS EXAMINATION OF THE PARCHMENTS HIS VISITOR SAT DOWN
I WAS COMING ON TO FIND YOU AFTER I HAD RELEASED MYSELF BUT I HEARD FOOTSTEPS AND I HID AWAY
IN WHICH SHE HAD PICTURED HERSELF WALKING IN STATE TOWARDS THE ALTAR FLUSHED BY THE PURPLE LIGHT AND BLOOM OF HER OWN PASSION WITHOUT A SINGLE MISGIVING AS TO THE SEALING OF THE BOND AND FERVENTLY RECEIVING AS HER DUE
BUT THERE MY GENTLEMAN WAS BUT ROBERT OF ALL PLACES THAT WAS WHERE HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN WELL TWAS HIS NATIVE HOME COME TO THAT AND WHERE ELSE COULD WE EXPECT HIM TO BE I DON'T CARE WHO THE MAN IS
ON WHICH ACCOUNT AN ENDLESS SHEARING OF THE HEAVY ARMED IVY WAS NECESSARY AND A CONTINUAL LOPPING OF TREES AND SHRUBS IT WAS AN EDIFICE BUILT IN TIMES WHEN HUMAN CONSTITUTIONS WERE DAMP PROOF
SEEING THAT WINTERBORNE WAS NOTICING HIM HE LET HIS GLASS DROP WITH A CLICK UPON THE RAIL WHICH PROTECTED THE HEDGE AND WALKED AWAY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION GILES KNEW IN A MOMENT THAT THIS MUST BE MISTER FITZPIERS
IN REFUSING THAT POOR MAN HIS REASONABLE REQUEST SHE SAID TO HERSELF I FOREDOOMED MY REJUVENATED GIRLHOOD'S ROMANCE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SUCH A BUSINESS MATTER COULD HAVE NETTLED MY OWN HEART LIKE THIS
I DO NOT INQUIRE WITHOUT GOOD REASON GOD FORBID THAT I SHOULD KNEEL IN ANOTHER'S PLACE AT ANY SHRINE UNFAIRLY BUT MY DEAR MISS MELBURY NOW THAT HE IS GONE MAY I DRAW NEAR
HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO DESCEND EVERY YEAR WITH HIS PORTABLE MILL AND PRESS
AND THE WORLD HAD APPROXIMATED TO WINTERBORNE'S LEVEL OF INTELLIGENT INTERCOURSE WITH NATURE IN THAT RESPECT SHE HAD FORMED THE COMPLEMENT TO HIM IN THE OTHER SEX HAD LIVED AS HIS COUNTERPART HAD SUBJOINED HER THOUGHT TO HIS AS A COROLLARY
HE MARVELLED WHAT PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IN THE PAST TO INVENT SUCH PRECARIOUS TENURES AS THESE STILL MORE WHAT COULD HAVE INDUCED HIS ANCESTORS AT HINTOCK AND OTHER VILLAGE PEOPLE TO EXCHANGE THEIR OLD COPYHOLDS FOR LIFE LEASES
IT WILL BE VERY CONVENIENT TO HAVE A MEDICAL MAN IF HE IS CLEVER IN ONE'S OWN PARISH I GET DREADFULLY NERVOUS SOMETIMES LIVING IN SUCH AN OUTLANDISH PLACE AND SHERTON IS SO FAR TO SEND TO
GRACE MELBURY WOULD SERVE TO KEEP HIS SOUL ALIVE AND TO RELIEVE THE MONOTONY OF HIS DAYS HIS FIRST NOTION ACQUIRED FROM THE MERE SIGHT OF HER WITHOUT CONVERSE THAT OF AN IDLE AND VULGAR FLIRTATION WITH A TIMBER MERCHANT'S PRETTY DAUGHTER
AND THEN THEN THE FIRE WOULD HAVE BURNED HIGHER AND HIGHER WHAT WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED I KNOW NOT BUT SORROW AND SICKNESS OF HEART AT LAST
SHE JUMPED AT THE OPPORTUNITY OF HONORING HIS WORD AT THE MOMENT OF HER MENTAL LIBERATION THE BUSHES ABOUT THE GARDEN HAD MOVED AND HER FATHER EMERGED INTO THE SHADY GLADE WELL I HOPE IT IS MADE UP HE SAID CHEERILY
THEN I AM GOING HE SAID VERY WELL SHE ANSWERED STRETCHING ONE HAND ROUND TO HIM AND PATTING HER EYES WITH A HANDKERCHIEF HELD IN THE OTHER
THESE OF HER HOUSEHOLD PREFERRED TO REGARD THEIR MISTRESS AS THE DEEPER SINNER MELBURY SAT WITH HIS HANDS RESTING ON THE FAMILIAR KNOBBED THORN WALKING STICK WHOSE GROWING HE HAD SEEN BEFORE HE ENJOYED ITS USE
SHE DOESN'T SEE US WELL NEVER MIND LET HER BE GRACE WAS INDEED QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF FITZPIERS'S PROPINQUITY SHE WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING WHICH HAD LITTLE CONNECTION WITH THE SCENE BEFORE HER THINKING OF HER FRIEND LOST AS SOON AS FOUND MISSUS CHARMOND
THEIRS GREW AS IMPERCEPTIBLY AS THE TREE TWIGS BUDDED
FITZPIERS TOOK HER HAND WE DECLARE IT DO WE NOT MY DEAR GRACE SAID HE RELIEVED OF HER DOUBT SOMEWHAT OVERAWED AND EVER ANXIOUS TO PLEASE SHE WAS DISPOSED TO SETTLE THE MATTER YET WOMANLIKE
OF ALL THE DEGREES AND QUALITIES OF PUNISHMENT THAT FITZPIERS HAD UNDERGONE SINCE HIS SINS AGAINST GRACE FIRST BEGAN NOT ANY EVEN APPROXIMATED IN INTENSITY TO THIS OH MY OWN MY DARLING OH CRUEL HEAVEN IT IS TOO MUCH THIS
AND WENT OUTSIDE IT TOWARDS COMPARATIVELY OPEN GROUND HAVING LOOKED ROUND ABOUT THEY WERE INTENDING TO RE ENTER THE COPSE WHEN A FOX QUIETLY EMERGED WITH A DRAGGING BRUSH TROTTED PAST THEM TAMELY AS A DOMESTIC CAT AND DISAPPEARED AMID SOME DEAD FERN
IMAGINE THE JANGLE OF THE THREE THIN TONED HINTOCK BELLS THE DIALOGUES SEEMED TO GROW LOUDER AND THE DING DING DONG OF THOSE THREE CRAZED BELLS MORE PERSISTENT SHE AWOKE THE MORNING HAD COME
HE WAS ACTUALLY SUPPORTING HER WITH HIS ARM AS THOUGH UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS QUITE OVERCOME AND IN DANGER OF FALLING AS SOON AS SHE COULD COLLECT HER IDEAS SHE GENTLY WITHDREW FROM HIS GRASP AND EXPLAINED WHAT SHE HAD RETURNED FOR
AND TO DRAW GROANS FROM THE GREGARIOUSLY DISPOSED GRACE DESCENDED THE GREEN ESCARPMENT BY A ZIGZAG PATH INTO THE DRIVE WHICH SWEPT ROUND BENEATH THE SLOPE THE EXTERIOR OF THE HOUSE HAD BEEN FAMILIAR TO HER FROM HER CHILDHOOD
MY REFLECTIONS DOCTOR YOU MUST NOT COME HERE ANY MORE THEY BEGIN TO THINK IT A FARCE ALREADY I SAY YOU MUST COME NO MORE
HE IS GETTING OLD AND IRRITABLE THAT WAS WHY I DID NOT GOOD BY BUT AS I MUST STAY AT THE EARL OF WESSEX TO NIGHT FOR I CANNOT POSSIBLY CATCH THE TRAIN I THINK IT WOULD BE SAFER FOR YOU TO LET ME TAKE CARE OF YOU
THE WHITE SKIRT OF A LONG LOOSE GARMENT A GRAY ARM STRETCHING FROM WITHIN THE PORCH ADJUSTED THE SHAWL OVER THE WOMAN'S SHOULDERS IT WAS WITHDRAWN AND DISAPPEARED THE DOOR CLOSING BEHIND HER
AND THE STICKY INNER SURFACE OF THE SCATTERED BARK GLISTENED AS IT REVEALED ITS PALE MADDER HUES TO THE EYE MELBURY WAS SO HIGHLY SATISFIED AT HAVING FITZPIERS AS A SORT OF GUEST
AND COMPELLED TO RETREAT TO A SWAMP IN THIS VERY WOOD WHENCE THEY WERE RETURNING TO THEIR OLD QUARTERS AT THE RATE OF A COCK'S STRIDE EVERY NEW YEAR'S DAY OLD STYLE HENCE THE LOCAL SAYING ON NEW YEAR'S TIDE A COCK'S STRIDE
IF I DRAGGED HER HEAD OFF DOWN SHE SAT AND OUT IT CAME A LOVELY MOLAR NOT A SPECK UPON IT AND OFF SHE WENT WITH IT IN HER HANDKERCHIEF
DOCTOR YOU ARE GOING AWAY SHE EXCLAIMED CONFRONTING HIM WITH ACCUSATORY REPROACH IN HER LARGE DARK EYES NO LESS THAN IN HER RICH COOING VOICE OH YES YOU ARE SHE WENT ON SPRINGING TO HER FEET
AND SENT TO HINTOCK HOUSE WHENCE
DESPITE HER FEELING SHE ASSENTED TO THIS HIS REASONING HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT ITS WEIGHT UPON HER GRACE HE SAID JUST BEFORE THEY HAD REACHED THE HOUSE IF IT COSTS ME MY LIFE YOU SHALL MARRY WELL
WINTERBORNE'S MIND RAN ON HIS CONTEMPLATED EVENING PARTY HIS ABSTRACTION BEING SUCH THAT HE HARDLY WAS CONSCIOUS OF MARTY'S PRESENCE BESIDE HIM FROM THE NATURE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT IN WHICH HE HANDLED THE SPADE AND SHE MERELY HELD THE TREE
IN WHICH HE BRIEFLY STATED THAT HE WAS PLACED IN SUCH A POSITION AS TO MAKE HIM SHARE TO THE FULL MELBURY'S VIEW OF HIS OWN AND HIS DAUGHTER'S PROMISE MADE SOME YEARS BEFORE TO WISH THAT IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS CANCELLED
WHEN MISS MELBURY WAS ANNOUNCED AND SAW HER THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS BETWEEN THEM SHE CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE ON HER FACE AND TOLD THE YOUNG GIRL IT WAS GOOD OF HER TO COME AH YOU HAVE NOTICED THOSE SHE SAID
THE LIKELIHOOD WAS THAT DEATH ALONE HAD HINDERED HIM IN THE EXECUTION OF HIS PROJECT
HAD WE NOT DISMISSED HIM ALREADY WE COULD HARDLY HAVE FOUND IT IN OUR HEARTS TO DISMISS HIM NOW SO I SAY BE THANKFUL I'LL DO ALL I CAN FOR HIM AS A FRIEND BUT AS A PRETENDER TO THE POSITION OF MY SON IN LAW THAT CAN NEVER BE THOUGHT OF MORE
WHICH MARTY'S HAD NOT REMAINED
HE DREW BACK THE WINDOW CURTAINS WHEREUPON THE RED GLOW OF THE LAMP AND THE TWO CANDLE FLAMES BECAME ALMOST INVISIBLE WITH THE FLOOD OF LATE AUTUMN SUNLIGHT THAT POURED IN SHALL I COME ROUND TO YOU HE ASKED HER BACK BEING TOWARDS HIM NO
CAUSED HER GRAVE MISGIVINGS DO SIT DOWN MISTER MELBURY YOU HAVE FELLED ALL THE TREES THAT WERE TO BE PURCHASED BY YOU THIS SEASON EXCEPT THE OAKS I BELIEVE YES SAID MELBURY HOW VERY NICE
AND SO YOU DON'T FEEL YOUR PLACE SO STRONGLY
AND WHEN HE CEASED SPEAKING SHE SAID WITH HURRIED HOT BREATH WHAT HAS LED YOU TO THINK THIS OF ME WHO SAYS I HAVE WON YOUR DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND AWAY FROM HER SOME MONSTROUS CALUMNIES ARE AFLOAT OF WHICH I HAVE KNOWN NOTHING UNTIL NOW MELBURY STARTED AND LOOKED AT HER SIMPLY
IF ANY CAME PLODDING THOUGHTFULLY ONWARD HE CROSSED A GLADE LYING BETWEEN LITTLE HINTOCK WOODS AND THE PLANTATION WHICH ABUTTED ON THE PARK AND THE SPOT BEING OPEN HE WAS DISCERNED THERE BY WINTERBORNE FROM THE COPSE ON THE NEXT HILL WHERE HE AND HIS MEN WERE WORKING
INDEED I ROSE LATE TO DAY I HAVE HAD A BROKEN NIGHT OR RATHER MORNING
THE FEELING IS LESS STRONG NOW PERHAPS AH NOW THOUGH YOU DON'T SEE IT YOUR FEELING AT THE TIME WAS THE RIGHT ONE BECAUSE YOUR MIND AND BODY WERE JUST IN FULL AND FRESH CULTIVATION SO THAT GOING THERE WITH HER WAS LIKE MEETING LIKE
WHO WAS LOOKING OVER THE HEDGE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY UPON THE FIGURE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS GRACE HE APPEARED AS A HANDSOME AND GENTLEMANLY PERSONAGE OF SIX OR EIGHT AND TWENTY AND WAS QUIZZING HER THROUGH AN EYE GLASS
NO DOUBT YOU FEEL HINTOCK TO BE A GREAT CHANGE AFTER WATERING PLACE LIFE I DO BUT IT IS HOME IT HAS ITS ADVANTAGES AND ITS DISADVANTAGES GRACE WAS THINKING LESS OF THE SOLITUDE THAN OF THE ATTENDANT CIRCUMSTANCES
I WISH NOT TO MARRY ANYBODY BUT I'LL MARRY GILES WINTERBORNE IF YOU SAY I MUST AS AN ALTERNATIVE HER FATHER'S FACE SETTLED INTO RIGIDITY HE TURNED PALE AND CAME DELIBERATELY OUT OF THE PLOT BEFORE HE ANSWERED HER
WHATEVER THE VALUE OF TACITURNITY TO A MAN AMONG STRANGERS IT IS APT TO EXPRESS MORE THAN TALKATIVENESS WHEN HE DWELLS AMONG FRIENDS
AS THE TRUE AND ONLY PERIOD OF MERRY ENGLAND IN THE RURAL DISTRICTS MORE ESPECIALLY AND ONWARD DOWN TO THE THIRD DECADE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THIS MODEL HAD BORNE THE PALM AND HAD BEEN MOST USUALLY FOLLOWED WHEN THE ORCHARDS AND ESTATES REQUIRED NEW ONES
WHY HAD HE CARRIED OUT THIS IMPULSE TAKEN SUCH WILD TROUBLE TO EFFECT A PROBABLE INJURY TO HIS OWN AND HIS YOUNG WIFE'S PROSPECTS HIS MOTIVE WAS FANTASTIC GLOWING SHAPELESS AS THE FIERY SCENERY ABOUT THE WESTERN SKY
IN THE HOUSE OF A FRIENDLY NEIGHBOR AND GONE AWAY PEOPLE SAID THAT A CERTAIN LAXITY HAD CREPT INTO HIS LIFE THAT HE HAD NEVER GONE NEAR A CHURCH LATTERLY AND HAD BEEN SOMETIMES SEEN ON SUNDAYS WITH UNBLACKED BOOTS LYING ON HIS ELBOW UNDER A TREE
JOKING WITH THE ROUGH WORK FOLK AND ALL THAT I COULD HAVE STOOD IT
IF A BLACK COATED SQUIRE OR PA'SON HAD BEEN WALKING WITH YOU INSTEAD OF ME
AND EDGING THROUGH A SLIT IN THE GARDEN FENCE WALKED AWAY INTO THE WOOD JUST ABOUT HERE THE TREES WERE LARGE AND WIDE APART AND THERE WAS NO UNDERGROWTH SO THAT SHE COULD BE SEEN TO SOME DISTANCE A SYLPH LIKE GREENISH WHITE CREATURE
AND THE BEST WINE THAT BERRIES COULD RISE TO AND THE BRISKEST HORNER AND CLEEVES CIDER EVER WRUNG DOWN LEAVING OUT THE SPICE AND SPERRITS I PUT INTO IT
SHE MADE NO FURTHER ATTEMPT AT RESERVE I WOULD ASK YOU TO COME INTO THE HOUSE SHE SAID BUT MY MEETINGS WITH YOU
AS TO SHOW THAT HE STOOD NO LOWER IF NO HIGHER IN HER REGARD THAN HE HAD STOOD BEFORE WHEN THEY WERE OPPOSITE AN OPENING THROUGH WHICH BY DAY THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE COULD BE SEEN THEY OBSERVED A LIGHT IN ONE OF HIS ROOMS
IT WAS A FEW HOURS AFTER THIS THAT WINTERBORNE WHO CURIOUSLY ENOUGH HAD NOT PERCEIVED GRACE WRITING
HE WILL SURELY GUESS SOMEBODY HAS SEEN ME FOR CERTAIN
OWING OBVIOUSLY TO A CONVICTION THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE LIVING THERE LONG ENOUGH TO PROFIT BY NEXT SEASON'S CROP HE LOOKED AT THE LEASES AGAIN AND THE LETTER ATTACHED
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM LOOK SO INCENSED BEFORE NOW HEARKEN TO ME HE SAID THERE'S A TIME FOR A WOMAN TO ALTER HER MIND AND THERE'S A TIME WHEN SHE CAN NO LONGER ALTER IT IF SHE HAS ANY RIGHT EYE TO HER PARENTS HONOR
SHE SHOWED THAT OBLIQUE MANNERED SOFTNESS WHICH IS PERHAPS MOST FREQUENT IN WOMEN OF DARKER COMPLEXION AND MORE LYMPHATIC TEMPERAMENT THAN MISSUS CHARMOND'S WAS WHO LINGERINGLY SMILE THEIR MEANINGS TO MEN RATHER THAN SPEAK THEM
AS IF SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN LOST HER COURSE BEING PRECISELY THAT OF MISTER MELBURY'S GIG FITZPIERS BY A SORT OF DIVINATION JUMPED TO THE IDEA THAT THE FIGURE WAS GRACE'S HER NEARER APPROACH MADE THE GUESS A CERTAINTY
AND HERE HE HOVERED FOR HOURS AROUND THE SCENE OF THE PUREST EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES THAT HE HAD EVER KNOWN IN HIS LIFE HE WALKED ABOUT THE WOODS THAT SURROUNDED MELBURY'S HOUSE
SUPPER TIME CAME AND WITH IT THE HOT BAKED FROM THE OVEN LAID ON A SNOWY CLOTH FRESH FROM THE PRESS AND RETICULATED WITH FOLDS AS IN FLEMISH LAST SUPPERS
AND THE CHILD BECAME PRECIOUS AS THE APPLE OF MY EYE TO ME FOR SHE WAS ALL I HAD LEFT TO LOVE FOR HER SAKE ENTIRELY I MARRIED AS SECOND WIFE A HOMESPUN WOMAN WHO HAD BEEN KIND AS A MOTHER TO HER IN DUE TIME THE QUESTION OF HER EDUCATION CAME ON AND I SAID
AND DIRECTLY I HAD MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE THE OTHER DAY IT STRUCK ME THAT YOU WOULD SUIT ME SO WELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO UNDERTAKE IT YOU MIGHT READ TO ME TOO IF DESIRABLE WILL YOU THINK IT OVER AND ASK YOUR PARENTS IF THEY ARE WILLING
SHE WOULD TRAVEL WITH IT IN THE AUTUMN SEASON AS HE HAD DONE SHE SAID SHE WOULD BE QUITE STRONG ENOUGH WITH OLD CREEDLE AS AN ASSISTANT AH THERE WAS ONE NEARER TO HIM THAN YOU SAID FITZPIERS REFERRING TO WINTERBORNE ONE WHO LIVED WHERE HE LIVED
THAT QUICK GLITTERING PRACTICAL EYE SHARP FOR THE SURFACE OF THINGS AND FOR NOTHING BENEATH IT HE HAD NOT BUT WHETHER HIS APPARENT DEPTH OF VISION WAS REAL OR ONLY AN ARTISTIC ACCIDENT OF HIS CORPOREAL MOULDING NOTHING BUT HIS DEEDS COULD REVEAL
WAS NOT COMMON TO HIM LOOKING THROUGH THE TREES FITZPIERS SOON PERCEIVED THE ORIGIN OF THE NOISE THE BARKING SEASON HAD JUST COMMENCED AND WHAT HE HAD HEARD WAS THE TEAR OF THE RIPPING TOOL AS IT PLOUGHED ITS WAY ALONG THE STICKY PARTING BETWEEN THE TRUNK AND THE RIND
I WAS TRYING TO BE AS PUNCTUAL AS POSSIBLE
I NEVER DO MEET HIM FATHER
THE COUNTRYMAN WHO IS OBLIGED TO JUDGE THE TIME OF DAY FROM CHANGES IN EXTERNAL NATURE SEES A THOUSAND SUCCESSIVE TINTS AND TRAITS IN THE LANDSCAPE WHICH ARE NEVER DISCERNED BY HIM WHO HEARS THE REGULAR CHIME OF A CLOCK BECAUSE THEY ARE NEVER IN REQUEST
HE DECLARED THAT HE DID NOT LIKE TO BE HARD ON A MAN WHEN HE WAS IN DIFFICULTY BUT HE REALLY DID NOT SEE HOW WINTERBORNE COULD MARRY HIS DAUGHTER NOW WITHOUT EVEN A HOUSE TO TAKE HER TO
BUT YOU MUST SAID MELBURY IN SHORT
MISSUS CHARMOND LOOKED ILL AT EASE SHE MIGHT HAVE BEGUN TO GUESS HIS MEANING BUT APART FROM THAT SHE HAD SUCH DREAD OF CONTACT WITH ANYTHING PAINFUL HARSH OR EVEN EARNEST THAT HIS PRELIMINARIES ALONE WERE ENOUGH TO DISTRESS HER YES WHAT IS IT
THOUGH SHE REFRAINED FROM SCREAMING MELBURY JUMPED UP IMMEDIATELY BUT NOT MORE QUICKLY THAN FITZPIERS AND WHILE HER FATHER RAN TO THE HORSE'S HEAD AND SPEEDILY BEGAN TO CONTROL HIM
TIS TIMBER REJOINED GILES MORE SCRUPULOUS THAN HE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD NOT HIS OWN INTERESTS STOOD SO CLOSELY INVOLVED
THE SECRET OF QUIET HAPPINESS LAY IN LIMITING THE IDEAS AND ASPIRATIONS THESE MEN'S THOUGHTS WERE CONTERMINOUS WITH THE MARGIN OF THE HINTOCK WOODLANDS AND WHY SHOULD NOT HIS BE LIKEWISE LIMITED A SMALL PRACTICE AMONG THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM BEING THE BOUND OF HIS DESIRES
EVEN IF IT TELLS AGAINST ME HE SAID GOOD HUMOREDLY AND HE LOOKED HER PROUDLY UP AND DOWN
AND THIS WAS WHERE SHE FOUND HERSELF OVERSHADOWED WITH SUDDEN NIGHT AS IF A TORNADO HAD PASSED BY WHILE SHE SAT OR RATHER CROUCHED UNHINGED BY THE INTERVIEW LUNCH TIME CAME AND THEN THE EARLY AFTERNOON ALMOST WITHOUT HER CONSCIOUSNESS
HIS REMOTE GAZE AT HER HAD BEEN ONE OF MILD INTEREST RATHER THAN OF RAPTURE BUT SHE LOOKED SO LOVELY IN THE GREEN WORLD ABOUT HER HER PINK CHEEKS HER SIMPLE LIGHT DRESS
WAS SO GREAT THAT HE CRIED OUT LIKE ONE IN CORPORAL AGONY AND IN HIS MISERY
JUST BEFORE GRACE'S DEPARTURE THE TWO CHANCED TO PAUSE BEFORE A MIRROR WHICH REFLECTED THEIR FACES IN IMMEDIATE JUXTAPOSITION SO AS TO BRING INTO PROMINENCE THEIR RESEMBLANCES AND THEIR CONTRASTS
HAVING RETURNED FROM HER WALK SHE SAT AT BREAKFAST SILENTLY WHEN HER STEP MOTHER HAD LEFT THE ROOM SHE SAID TO HER FATHER I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND THAT I SHOULD LIKE MY ENGAGEMENT TO GILES TO CONTINUE FOR THE PRESENT AT ANY RATE TILL I CAN SEE FURTHER WHAT I OUGHT TO DO
SHE WAS IN WHITE UP TO THE WAIST AND FIGURED ABOVE SHE WAS IN SHORT GRACE HIS WIFE LACKING THE PORTION OF HER DRESS WHICH THE GIN RETAINED DON'T BE GRIEVED ABOUT ME DON'T DEAR EDGAR SHE EXCLAIMED RUSHING UP AND BENDING OVER HIM I AM NOT HURT A BIT
AND THE WOMAN TOLD HER TALE UNSKILFULLY FOR WANT OF PRACTICE AS SHE DECLARED MISTER MELBURY WAS STANDING BY AND EXCLAIMED CONTEMPTUOUSLY TELL HER FORTUNE INDEED HER FORTUNE HAS BEEN TOLD BY MEN OF SCIENCE
LOOK HERE HE HANDED ACROSS TO HER THE LETTER RECEIVED FROM GILES SHE READ IT AND SAID NO MORE COULD HE HAVE SEEN HER WRITE ON THE WALL SHE DID NOT KNOW
IT IS GOING TO BE SOLD THEY SAY THEN I WILL BUY IT FOR YOU SAID FITZPIERS THAT WILL BE MAKING YOU A RETURN FOR A KINDNESS YOU DID ME HIS GLANCE FELL UPON THE GIRL'S RARE COLORED HAIR WHICH HAD GROWN AGAIN OH MARTY
MOST OF THEM WITH LONG SHARP TEETH BUT A FEW WITH NONE SO THAT THEIR JAWS LOOKED LIKE THE BLANK GUMS OF OLD AGE WELL WE MUST NOT TAKE THEM TOO SERIOUSLY SAID MISSUS CHARMOND WITH AN INDOLENT TURN OF HER HEAD
AND I SHOULD LIKE TO PREPARE HIM NEVER MIND DEAREST I COULD NOT VERY WELL HAVE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION I SHALL NEVER LIVE HERE AGAIN AS MUCH FOR YOUR SAKE AS FOR MINE I HAVE NEWS TO TELL YOU ON THIS VERY POINT BUT MY ALARM HAD PUT IT OUT OF MY HEAD
SAW THAT THE HORSE HAD BECOME RESTLESS
EACH HAD BEEN ENDOWED AND QUICKENED WITH A SUBTLE CHARM SINCE HE HAD DISCOVERED THE PERSON AND HISTORY AND ABOVE ALL MOOD OF THEIR OWNER THERE WAS EVERY TEMPORAL REASON FOR LEAVING IT
EVEN IF SHE HAD NOT TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIS HOUSE SOMETIMES SHE SUCCEEDED IN HER ATTEMPT SOMETIMES SHE DID NOT THEY STOOD BY THE GRAVE TOGETHER AND THOUGH THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN
GRACE GAVE A START AND A SCREAM THE PLACE HAD BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HIM IN HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE HAD NOT EXPECTED TO FIND HIM THERE STILL FITZPIERS LOST NOT A MOMENT IN RISING AND GOING TO HER SIDE I FRIGHTENED YOU DREADFULLY I KNOW HE SAID
WERE WHAT THE ACQUAINTANCE WOULD HAVE TO FEED ON SUCH ANTICIPATED GLIMPSES OF HER NOW AND THEN REALIZED THEMSELVES IN THE EVENT RENCOUNTERS OF NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE'S DURATION FREQUENTLY REPEATED WILL BUILD UP MUTUAL INTEREST EVEN AN INTIMACY IN A LONELY PLACE
IT WOULD HAVE DRIVEN HER WELL NIGH TO INSANITY BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS THAT BARE POSSIBILITY THAT HIS EXPOSURE HAD ONLY PRECIPITATED WHAT WAS INEVITABLE SHE LONGED TO BELIEVE THAT IT HAD NOT DONE EVEN THIS
TIS GONE SEE SAID MISTER FITZPIERS AS SOON AS THE OLD MAN SAW THE VACANT PATCH OF SKY IN PLACE OF THE BRANCHED COLUMN SO FAMILIAR TO HIS GAZE HE SPRANG UP SPEECHLESS HIS EYES ROSE FROM THEIR HOLLOWS TILL THE WHITES SHOWED ALL ROUND HE FELL BACK AND A BLUISH WHITENESS OVERSPREAD HIM
WHAT SUDDENLY FILLED HIS HEART FAR MORE THAN CURIOSITY ABOUT THEIR AUTHORSHIP WAS A TERRIBLE BELIEF THAT THEY WERE TURNING OUT TO BE TRUE TRY TO SEE GRACE AS HE MIGHT THEY DECIDED THE QUESTION FOR HIM
HE LEFT HER AT THE DOOR OF HER FATHER'S HOUSE AS HE RECEDED AND WAS CLASPED OUT OF SIGHT BY THE FILMY SHADES HE IMPRESSED GRACE AS A MAN WHO HARDLY APPERTAINED TO HER EXISTENCE AT ALL
THERE WAS A SORT OF SYMPATHY BETWEEN HIMSELF AND THE FIR OAK OR BEECH THAT HE WAS OPERATING ON SO THAT THE ROOTS TOOK HOLD OF THE SOIL IN A FEW DAYS WHEN ON THE OTHER HAND ANY OF THE JOURNEYMEN PLANTED
WHEREIN HUNG SOLITARY THE FOLDING STAR I SAID AT ONCE THAT YOU HAD FINALLY AGREED TO PAY THE PREMIUM THEY ASK AND THAT THE TEDIOUS QUESTION HAD BEEN SETTLED WHEN DO WE GO EDGAR I HAVE ALTERED MY MIND SAID HE
HE PASSED A MONTH OR TWO OF GREAT MISERY AT EXBURY THE PLACE TO WHICH HE HAD RETIRED QUITE AS MUCH MISERY INDEED AS GRACE
BEING READY AND ZEALOUS TO INTERROGATE ALL PHYSICAL MANIFESTATIONS BUT PRIMARILY HE WAS AN IDEALIST HE BELIEVED THAT BEHIND THE IMPERFECT LAY THE PERFECT THAT RARE THINGS WERE TO BE DISCOVERED AMID A BULK OF COMMONPLACE
MEANWHILE IN THE WOOD THEY HAD COME FROM THE MEN HAD SAT ON SO LONG THAT THEY WERE INDISPOSED TO BEGIN WORK AGAIN THAT EVENING THEY WERE PAID BY THE TON AND THEIR TIME FOR LABOR WAS AS THEY CHOSE
THEY PLACED THE LAST GATHERINGS OF BARK IN ROWS FOR THE CURERS WHICH LED THEM FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE SHED AND THUS THEY GRADUALLY WITHDREW AS THE SUN WENT DOWN FITZPIERS LINGERED YET HE HAD OPENED HIS BOOK AGAIN THOUGH HE COULD HARDLY SEE A WORD IN IT
I RETURNED FOR A MOMENT TO TELL YOU THAT THE EVENING IS GOING TO BE FINE THE SUN IS SHINING SO DO OPEN YOUR CURTAINS AND PUT OUT THOSE LIGHTS SHALL I DO IT FOR YOU
WHO KEPT HER SEAT WHERE AND HOW TO DUCK HER HEAD SO AS TO AVOID THE OVERHANGING BRANCHES THEY STOPPED AT THE SPOT WHERE THE BARK RIPPING HAD BEEN TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED
SAID SUKE STARTING UP IN BED SOUNDS AS IF SOMEBODY HAD CAUGHT A HARE IN HIS GIN
RIGHT AND LEFT OF THE NARROW PASS BETWEEN THE OAKS WERE DENSE BUSHES AND NOW FROM BEHIND THESE A FEMALE FIGURE GLIDED WHOSE APPEARANCE EVEN IN THE GLOOM WAS THOUGH GRACEFUL IN OUTLINE NOTICEABLY STRANGE
I WONDER IF HE TOO HAS DONKEY FEVER BUT PRETENDING HE HAD SEEN NOTHING HE ASKED WITH A SMILE HOW ARE YOU MY DEAR LAMP WICK VERY WELL
YOU HAD DONKEYS IN YOUR SCHOOL HOW YOU MUST HAVE STUDIED THE MARIONETTE ASHAMED AND HURT BY THOSE WORDS DID NOT ANSWER BUT TAKING HIS GLASS OF MILK RETURNED TO HIS FATHER FROM THAT DAY ON FOR MORE THAN FIVE MONTHS
RETURN HOME AND GIVE THE FOUR GOLD PIECES YOU HAVE LEFT TO YOUR POOR OLD FATHER WHO IS WEEPING BECAUSE HE HAS NOT SEEN YOU FOR MANY A DAY TOMORROW MY FATHER WILL BE A RICH MAN FOR THESE FOUR GOLD PIECES WILL BECOME TWO THOUSAND
THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU HERE ONLY TO GIVE YOU FOOD AND DRINK OH NO YOU ARE TO HELP ME EARN SOME FINE GOLD PIECES DO YOU HEAR COME ALONG NOW I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU TO JUMP AND BOW
HE NOTICED A LARGE SNAIL CRAWLING OUT OF SOME BUSHES DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME SAID THE SNAIL YES AND NO DO YOU REMEMBER THE SNAIL THAT LIVED WITH THE FAIRY WITH AZURE HAIR DO YOU NOT REMEMBER HOW SHE OPENED THE DOOR FOR YOU ONE NIGHT AND GAVE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT
GLADLY WITH MY WHOLE HEART WILL YOU LET ME SEE YOUR EARS WHY NOT
WON'T YOU TRY PRETTY LITTLE SNAIL TO FREE ME FROM THIS TERRIBLE TORTURE
TAKE THAT PATH ON YOUR LEFT AND FOLLOW YOUR NOSE YOU CAN'T GO WRONG TELL ME ANOTHER THING YOU WHO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT THROUGH THE SEA DID YOU NOT PERHAPS MEET A LITTLE BOAT WITH MY FATHER IN IT AND WHO IS YOU FATHER HE IS THE BEST FATHER IN THE WORLD
HOWEVER NOT ONE OF THEM WAS VERY HUNGRY THE POOR CAT FELT VERY WEAK AND HE WAS ABLE TO EAT ONLY THIRTY FIVE MULLETS WITH TOMATO SAUCE AND FOUR PORTIONS OF TRIPE WITH CHEESE MOREOVER
I AM SICK
HURRY I BEG OF YOU FOR I AM DYING OF COLD MY BOY I AM A SNAIL AND SNAILS ARE NEVER IN A HURRY AN HOUR PASSED
NOT ADDING ANOTHER WORD PINOCCHIO TOOK THE CANDLE IN HIS HAND AND GOING AHEAD TO LIGHT THE WAY HE SAID TO HIS FATHER FOLLOW ME AND HAVE NO FEAR THEY WALKED A LONG DISTANCE THROUGH THE STOMACH AND THE WHOLE BODY OF THE SHARK WHEN THEY REACHED THE THROAT OF THE MONSTER THEY STOPPED FOR A WHILE
AND A DAY CAME WHEN HE PUT ENOUGH MONEY TOGETHER TO KEEP HIS OLD FATHER COMFORTABLE AND HAPPY BESIDES THIS HE WAS ABLE TO SAVE THE GREAT AMOUNT OF FIFTY PENNIES WITH IT HE WANTED TO BUY HIMSELF A NEW SUIT ONE DAY HE SAID TO HIS FATHER
IF THE WORK IS TOO HARD FOR YOU MY BOY ENJOY YOUR YAWNS AND MAY THEY BRING YOU LUCK
ANSWERED THE DOG YOU SAVED ME ONCE AND WHAT IS GIVEN IS ALWAYS RETURNED WE ARE IN THIS WORLD TO HELP ONE ANOTHER BUT HOW DID YOU GET IN THAT CAVE I WAS LYING HERE ON THE SAND MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE
WHICH IS COMING TO GET ME FOR THE LAST TIME ARE YOU COMING OR NOT BUT IS IT REALLY TRUE THAT IN THAT COUNTRY BOYS NEVER HAVE TO STUDY
EITHER FROM PAIN OR WEAKNESS HE FELL TO THE FLOOR IN A DEAD FAINT WHEN HE REGAINED HIS SENSES HE FOUND HIMSELF STRETCHED OUT ON A SOFA AND THE FAIRY WAS SEATED NEAR HIM
BUT THAT HE HAD BECOME A REAL LIVE BOY HE LOOKED ALL ABOUT HIM AND INSTEAD OF THE USUAL WALLS OF STRAW HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A BEAUTIFULLY FURNISHED LITTLE ROOM THE PRETTIEST HE HAD EVER SEEN IN A TWINKLING
THAT I AM LIKE A CAT I SEE BETTER AT NIGHT THAN BY DAY POOR PINOCCHIO PRETENDED TO BE PEACEFUL AND CONTENTED BUT HE WAS FAR FROM THAT HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL DISCOURAGED
THIS COTTAGE WAS GIVEN TO ME YESTERDAY BY A LITTLE GOAT WITH BLUE HAIR AND WHERE DID THE GOAT GO ASKED PINOCCHIO I DON'T KNOW
HE LOOKED FOR LAMP WICK EVERYWHERE ALONG THE STREETS IN THE SQUARES INSIDE THE THEATRES EVERYWHERE BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND HE ASKED EVERYONE
NOW I SHALL NEVER NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN
OR AWAKE AND DECIDED HE MUST BE AWAKE AND WHERE IS FATHER HE CRIED SUDDENLY HE RAN INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND THERE STOOD GEPPETTO GROWN YEARS YOUNGER OVERNIGHT SPICK AND SPAN IN HIS NEW CLOTHES AND GAY AS A LARK IN THE MORNING
AT TAG HERE A GROUP
KNOW THEN THAT WITHIN TWO OR THREE HOURS YOU WILL NO LONGER BE A MARIONETTE NOR A BOY WHAT SHALL I BE
HOW SHALL I EVER LOOK AT MY LITTLE MOTHER AGAIN WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME WHERE SHALL I GO WHERE SHALL I HIDE OH HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A THOUSAND TIMES BETTER IF ONLY I HAD GONE TO SCHOOL WHY DID I LISTEN TO THOSE BOYS
THAT DAY HE WENT STRAIGHT TO HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE TO INVITE HIM TO THE PARTY BUT LAMP WICK WAS NOT AT HOME HE WENT A SECOND TIME AND AGAIN A THIRD
LOOKED ABOUT HIM TO SEE WHENCE THE WORDS HAD COME BUT HE SAW NO ONE THE DONKEYS GALLOPED
THE SEA WAS AS SMOOTH AS GLASS HEY THERE BOYS WHERE'S THAT SHARK HE ASKED TURNING TO HIS PLAYMATES HE MAY HAVE GONE FOR HIS BREAKFAST SAID ONE OF THEM LAUGHING OR PERHAPS HE WENT TO BED FOR A LITTLE NAP SAID ANOTHER LAUGHING ALSO
WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE SWAM SWIFTLY AWAY IN AN EFFORT TO REACH LAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ALL AT ONCE HE NOTICED THAT GEPPETTO WAS SHIVERING AND SHAKING AS IF WITH A HIGH FEVER WAS HE SHIVERING FROM FEAR OR FROM COLD WHO KNOWS PERHAPS A LITTLE OF BOTH
HAS FOUND SOME SURPRISE AWAITING HIM OF THE KIND WHICH PINOCCHIO HAD ON THAT EVENTFUL MORNING OF HIS LIFE THERE ARE BUT FEW
HE FOUND THE BREAD TO BE MADE OF CHALK THE CHICKEN OF CARDBOARD AND THE BRILLIANT FRUIT OF COLORED ALABASTER HE WANTED TO CRY HE WANTED TO GIVE HIMSELF UP TO DESPAIR HE WANTED TO THROW AWAY THE TRAY AND ALL THAT WAS ON IT INSTEAD
THINK HOW GREAT WAS HIS SURPRISE
WILL YOU BE KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE A PENNY TO A POOR BOY WHO IS YAWNING FROM HUNGER GLADLY ANSWERED THE BRICKLAYER COME WITH ME AND CARRY SOME PLASTER AND INSTEAD OF ONE PENNY I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE BUT THE PLASTER IS HEAVY ANSWERED PINOCCHIO
AMONG OTHER THINGS HE BUILT A ROLLING CHAIR STRONG AND COMFORTABLE TO TAKE HIS OLD FATHER OUT FOR AN AIRING ON BRIGHT SUNNY DAYS IN THE EVENING THE MARIONETTE STUDIED BY LAMPLIGHT
IN DESPERATION HE RETURNED HOME AND KNOCKED AT THE DOOR WHO IS IT ASKED LAMP WICK FROM WITHIN IT IS I
HE FELT HE COULD NOT GO ON MUCH LONGER AND THE SHORE WAS STILL FAR AWAY HE SWAM A FEW MORE STROKES
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX PINOCCHIO FINALLY CEASES TO BE A MARIONETTE AND BECOMES A BOY MY DEAR FATHER WE ARE SAVED CRIED THE MARIONETTE
TUNNY YOU ARRIVED AT THE RIGHT MOMENT I IMPLORE YOU FOR THE LOVE YOU BEAR YOUR CHILDREN THE LITTLE TUNNIES TO HELP US OR WE ARE LOST WITH GREAT PLEASURE INDEED HANG ONTO MY TAIL BOTH OF YOU AND LET ME LEAD YOU
AND PULLING AND TUGGING AT THEM ANGRILY JUST AS IF THEY BELONGED TO ANOTHER MY DEAR BOY ANSWERED THE DORMOUSE TO CHEER HIM UP A BIT WHY WORRY NOW WHAT IS DONE CANNOT BE UNDONE YOU KNOW
HIS TONGUE WAS DRY AND TRY AS HE MIGHT HE COULD NOT UTTER A SINGLE WORD YET IN SPITE OF THIS NUMBNESS OF FEELING HE SUFFERED KEENLY AT THE THOUGHT OF PASSING UNDER THE WINDOWS OF HIS GOOD LITTLE FAIRY'S HOUSE WHAT WOULD SHE SAY ON SEEING HIM BETWEEN TWO CARABINEERS
TELL ME MY GOOD MAN HAVE YOU NOT PERHAPS A LITTLE SUIT TO GIVE ME SO THAT I MAY GO HOME MY BOY AS FOR CLOTHES I HAVE ONLY A BAG IN WHICH I KEEP HOPS IF YOU WANT IT TAKE IT THERE IT IS PINOCCHIO DID NOT WAIT FOR HIM TO REPEAT HIS WORDS
INDEED YES THEY WENT TWO HOURS AGO WHY IN SUCH A HURRY UNFORTUNATELY THE CAT RECEIVED A TELEGRAM WHICH SAID THAT HIS FIRST BORN WAS SUFFERING FROM CHILBLAINS AND WAS ON THE POINT OF DEATH
THE WHOLE COMPANY OF RUNAWAYS LAUGHED UPROARIOUSLY THE LITTLE FAT MAN DID NOT LAUGH HE WENT UP TO THE REBELLIOUS ANIMAL AND STILL SMILING BENT OVER HIM LOVINGLY AND
MY DONKEY HAS DRAWN THE WATER FOR ME BUT NOW THAT POOR ANIMAL IS DYING WILL YOU TAKE ME TO SEE HIM SAID PINOCCHIO GLADLY AS SOON AS PINOCCHIO WENT INTO THE STABLE HE SPIED A LITTLE DONKEY LYING ON A BED OF STRAW IN THE CORNER OF THE STABLE
THEY SOMEHOW MANAGED TO GET HOLD OF IT ONE OF THE BOOKS WAS A VERY LARGE VOLUME AN ARITHMETIC TEXT HEAVILY BOUND IN LEATHER IT WAS PINOCCHIO'S PRIDE AMONG ALL HIS BOOKS HE LIKED THAT ONE THE BEST
IS SHE AFRAID THE BATS WILL EAT YOU UP LISTEN LAMP WICK
YOURS FIRST THEN MINE WELL THEN
BEGINNING TO WAVER AND WEAKEN IN HIS GOOD RESOLUTIONS
WEEPING WEEPING JUST LIKE A BOY HEY MISTER DRIVER
BUT THE MOST HORRIBLE MOMENT WAS THE ONE IN WHICH THE TWO POOR CREATURES FELT THEIR TAILS APPEAR OVERCOME WITH SHAME AND GRIEF THEY TRIED TO CRY AND BEMOAN THEIR FATE
WERE WORDS LIKE THESE HURRAH FOR THE LAND OF TOYS DOWN WITH ARITHMETIC NO MORE SCHOOL AS SOON AS THEY HAD SET FOOT IN THAT LAND PINOCCHIO
I KNEW YOU ALSO
RUNS AWAY TO THE LAND OF TOYS WITH HIS FRIEND LAMP WICK
TO THAT LOVELY PLACE CALLED THE LAND OF TOYS IN FACT THE WAGON WAS SO CLOSELY PACKED WITH BOYS OF ALL AGES THAT IT LOOKED
HE TOOK THE BAG WHICH HAPPENED TO BE EMPTY AND AFTER CUTTING A BIG HOLE AT THE TOP AND TWO AT THE SIDES HE SLIPPED INTO IT AS IF IT WERE A SHIRT LIGHTLY CLAD AS HE WAS HE STARTED OUT TOWARD THE VILLAGE ALONG THE WAY HE FELT VERY UNEASY
OVERNIGHT THOSE TWO DAINTY ORGANS HAD BECOME AS LONG AS SHOE BRUSHES HE WENT IN SEARCH OF A MIRROR BUT NOT FINDING ANY HE JUST FILLED A BASIN WITH WATER AND LOOKED AT HIMSELF
HOW COULD THEY DO SUCH A THING BEING PEOPLE OF GREAT REFINEMENT THEY DID NOT WANT TO OFFEND YOU SO DEEPLY AS NOT TO ALLOW YOU THE HONOR OF PAYING THE BILL TOO BAD
AND HE STARTED TO YAWN FROM HUNGER AS HE YAWNED HE OPENED A MOUTH AS
IN A FEW YEARS HE HAD BECOME A MILLIONAIRE WHAT HAPPENED TO LAMP WICK MY DEAR CHILDREN I DO NOT KNOW PINOCCHIO I CAN TELL YOU MET WITH GREAT HARDSHIPS EVEN FROM THE FIRST DAY
AND GAVE THE DONKEY A HEARTY BLOW ACROSS THE LEGS PINOCCHIO SCREAMED WITH PAIN AND AS HE SCREAMED HE BRAYED HAW HAW HAW I CAN'T DIGEST STRAW THEN EAT THE HAY ANSWERED HIS MASTER
TO THINK THAT EVEN YESTERDAY THE IDEA CAME INTO YOUR HEAD TO RETURN HOME TO SEE YOUR FAIRY
THIS SAID HE TOOK THE PATH AT SO SWIFT A GAIT THAT HE SEEMED TO FLY AND AT EVERY SMALL SOUND HE HEARD HE TURNED IN FEAR TO SEE WHETHER THE TERRIBLE SHARK FIVE STORIES HIGH AND WITH A TRAIN IN HIS MOUTH WAS FOLLOWING HIM AFTER WALKING A HALF HOUR
POOR CRAB HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE SPOKEN TO THE WIND INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO HIS GOOD ADVICE PINOCCHIO TURNED TO HIM AND SAID AS ROUGHLY AS HE KNEW HOW KEEP QUIET UGLY GAB IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU TO CHEW A FEW COUGH DROPS TO GET RID OF THAT COLD YOU HAVE
GO TO BED AND SLEEP YOU WILL FEEL BETTER IN THE MORNING IN THE MEANTIME THE BOYS HAVING USED ALL THEIR BOOKS LOOKED AROUND FOR NEW AMMUNITION
BOYS GIVE PROMISES VERY EASILY BUT THEY AS EASILY FORGET THEM BUT I AM NOT LIKE THOSE OTHERS WHEN I GIVE MY WORD I KEEP IT
DEAR FRIEND YOU HAVE SAVED MY FATHER AND I HAVE NOT ENOUGH WORDS WITH WHICH TO THANK YOU ALLOW ME TO EMBRACE YOU AS A SIGN OF MY ETERNAL GRATITUDE THE TUNNY STUCK HIS NOSE OUT OF THE WATER AND PINOCCHIO KNELT ON THE SAND AND KISSED HIM MOST AFFECTIONATELY ON HIS CHEEK
YOU ARE RIGHT LITTLE CRICKET YOU ARE MORE THAN RIGHT
SANG SLEEPILY BETWEEN HIS TEETH AFTER A MILE OR SO PINOCCHIO AGAIN HEARD THE SAME FAINT VOICE WHISPERING REMEMBER LITTLE SIMPLETON
AND BENDING LOW OVER HIM HE ASKED WHO ARE YOU
HE JUMPED TO THE GROUND RAN UP TO THE DONKEY ON WHOSE BACK HE HAD BEEN RIDING
AND HIS REPORT WAS SO GOOD THAT THE FAIRY SAID TO HIM HAPPILY TOMORROW YOUR WISH WILL COME TRUE AND WHAT IS IT TOMORROW YOU WILL CEASE TO BE A MARIONETTE AND WILL BECOME A REAL BOY
WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THAT MARVELOUS COUNTRY
ADMIRE HIM O SIGNORI AND ENJOY YOURSELVES I LET YOU NOW BE THE JUDGES OF MY SUCCESS AS A TEACHER OF ANIMALS BEFORE I LEAVE YOU I WISH TO STATE THAT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER PERFORMANCE TOMORROW NIGHT
AND SO I WENT BACK TO THE FAIRY'S HOUSE SHE WAS DEAD AND THE PIGEON SEEING ME CRYING SAID TO ME
COME WITH US BUT I AM INNOCENT COME WITH US BEFORE STARTING OUT THE OFFICERS CALLED OUT TO SEVERAL FISHERMEN PASSING BY IN A BOAT AND SAID TO THEM TAKE CARE OF THIS LITTLE FELLOW WHO HAS BEEN HURT TAKE HIM HOME AND BIND HIS WOUNDS TOMORROW WE'LL COME AFTER HIM
CATCALLS HAND CLAPPING FOLLOWED THIS PARADE ONE BOY MADE A NOISE LIKE A HEN ANOTHER LIKE A ROOSTER AND A THIRD IMITATED A LION IN HIS DEN ALL TOGETHER THEY CREATED SUCH A PANDEMONIUM THAT IT
AT THAT MOMENT A LOUD KNOCKING WAS HEARD AT THE DOOR AND A VOICE CALLED TO THEM
I THINK HE'S A VERY GOOD BOY FOND OF STUDY OBEDIENT KIND TO HIS FATHER AND TO HIS WHOLE FAMILY AS HE WAS TELLING ALL THESE ENORMOUS LIES ABOUT HIMSELF PINOCCHIO TOUCHED HIS NOSE AND FOUND IT TWICE AS LONG AS IT SHOULD BE
PINOCCHIO ATE LEAST OF ALL HE ASKED FOR A BITE OF BREAD AND A FEW NUTS AND THEN HARDLY TOUCHED THEM THE POOR FELLOW WITH HIS MIND ON THE FIELD OF WONDERS WAS SUFFERING FROM A GOLD PIECE INDIGESTION
IN ORDER TO BRING HIM TO MY WILL WITH ALL MY KINDNESS HOWEVER I NEVER SUCCEEDED IN GAINING MY DONKEY'S LOVE HE IS STILL TODAY AS SAVAGE AS THE DAY I FOUND HIM HE STILL FEARS AND HATES ME
THE HOUR IS LATE I WANT TO GO ON THE NIGHT IS VERY DARK I WANT TO GO ON THE ROAD IS DANGEROUS I WANT TO GO ON
BUT INSTEAD OF PUTTING IT ON HIS HEAD HE STUCK IT BETWEEN HIS TEETH AND THEN RACED TOWARD THE SEA HE WENT LIKE A BULLET OUT OF A GUN THE CARABINEERS JUDGING THAT IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO CATCH HIM SENT A LARGE MASTIFF AFTER HIM ONE THAT HAD WON FIRST PRIZE IN ALL THE DOG RACES
BUT THE FAULT IS NOT MINE BELIEVE ME LITTLE DORMOUSE
BUT WHAT FEVER IS IT THE DONKEY FEVER
YOU'LL BE SORRY CUCK OO WE'LL WHIP YOU SOUNDLY CUCK OO YOU'LL GO HOME WITH A BROKEN NOSE CUCK OO VERY WELL THEN TAKE THAT
BUT UNLUCKILY IN A MARIONETTE'S LIFE
EVEN AS I AM THE WORST SON THAT CAN BE FOUND IN THE STORM OF LAST NIGHT ANSWERED THE DOLPHIN THE LITTLE BOAT MUST HAVE BEEN SWAMPED AND MY FATHER BY THIS TIME HE MUST HAVE BEEN SWALLOWED BY THE TERRIBLE SHARK WHICH FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS
BOTH OF THEM AND YOURS BOTH OF THEM TOO I WONDER IF IT COULD BE THE SAME SICKNESS I'M AFRAID IT IS WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR LAMP WICK
BUZZ OF A FAR AWAY MOSQUITO THERE IT IS CRIED LAMP WICK JUMPING TO HIS FEET WHAT
WERE ONLY THOSE WHO EITHER THROUGH AGE OR SICKNESS HAD LOST THE MEANS OF EARNING THEIR BREAD WITH THEIR OWN HANDS ALL OTHERS SHOULD WORK AND IF THEY DIDN'T AND WENT HUNGRY SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THEM JUST THEN A MAN PASSED BY
THERE HE FOUND A NEW SUIT A NEW HAT AND A PAIR OF SHOES AS SOON AS HE WAS DRESSED HE PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND PULLED OUT A LITTLE LEATHER PURSE ON WHICH WERE WRITTEN THE FOLLOWING WORDS THE FAIRY WITH AZURE HAIR RETURNS
AT ONE END OF WHICH HE HAD WHITTLED A LONG FINE POINT INK HE HAD NONE SO HE USED THE JUICE OF BLACKBERRIES OR CHERRIES LITTLE BY LITTLE HIS DILIGENCE WAS REWARDED HE SUCCEEDED NOT ONLY IN HIS STUDIES BUT ALSO IN HIS WORK
HE CAME TO A SMALL COUNTRY CALLED THE LAND OF THE BUSY BEES THE STREETS WERE FILLED WITH PEOPLE RUNNING TO AND FRO ABOUT THEIR TASKS EVERYONE WORKED EVERYONE HAD SOMETHING TO DO
SHE WILL NEVER COME BACK YESTERDAY SHE WENT AWAY BLEATING SADLY AND IT SEEMED TO ME SHE SAID POOR PINOCCHIO I SHALL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN THE SHARK MUST HAVE EATEN HIM BY THIS TIME
HAS HE FAINTED I SHOULD SAY SO SAID ONE OF THE CARABINEERS BENDING TO LOOK AT EUGENE THIS BOY HAS BEEN WOUNDED ON THE TEMPLE
AND THIN AND HAD A WOEBEGONE LOOK ABOUT HIM LAMP WICK WAS THE LAZIEST BOY IN THE SCHOOL AND THE BIGGEST MISCHIEF MAKER BUT PINOCCHIO LOVED HIM DEARLY
REMEMBER THE OLD PROVERB WHOEVER STEALS HIS NEIGHBOR'S SHIRT USUALLY DIES WITHOUT HIS OWN
TO A REAL COUNTRY THE BEST IN THE WORLD A WONDERFUL PLACE
PINOCCHIO TRIED TWO OR THREE TIMES BUT EACH TIME HE CAME NEAR THE RING HE FOUND IT MORE TO HIS TASTE TO GO UNDER IT THE FOURTH TIME AT A LOOK FROM HIS MASTER HE LEAPED THROUGH IT BUT AS HE DID SO
WHO AM A FINE SWIMMER WILL CARRY YOU SAFELY TO THE SHORE DREAMS MY BOY ANSWERED GEPPETTO SHAKING HIS HEAD AND SMILING SADLY
NEAR A CLUMP OF TREES A TINY COTTAGE BUILT OF STRAW
A VERY QUIET VOICE WHISPERING TO HIM POOR SILLY YOU HAVE DONE AS YOU WISHED BUT YOU ARE GOING TO BE A SORRY BOY
WHICH ARE PASSING BY BRING ME SOMETHING TO EAT AT LEAST FOR I AM FAINT WITH HUNGER IMMEDIATELY
TELL ME MY FINE BOY DO YOU ALSO WANT TO COME TO MY WONDERFUL COUNTRY
PINOCCHIO WALKED TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM BUT WHEN HE REACHED IT REMEMBERING HIS DONKEY EARS
IF I EVEN KNEW WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE I WOULD FIND HERE BUT WHOM SHALL I ASK THERE IS NO ONE HERE THE IDEA OF FINDING HIMSELF IN SO LONESOME A SPOT MADE HIM SO SAD
ANSWERED THE LITTLE BEING IN A FAINT VOICE THAT SOUNDED AS IF IT CAME FROM A FAR AWAY WORLD WHAT DO YOU WANT ASKED THE MARIONETTE I WANT TO GIVE YOU A FEW WORDS OF GOOD ADVICE
BUT PINOCCHIO DID NOT LIKE THAT ANY BETTER AH YOU DON'T LIKE HAY EITHER HE CRIED ANGRILY WAIT MY PRETTY DONKEY I'LL TEACH YOU NOT TO BE SO PARTICULAR WITHOUT MORE ADO HE TOOK A WHIP
HE TURNED TO THE DOLPHIN AND SAID FAREWELL MISTER FISH
NEVER MIND ANSWERED LAMP WICK IF THERE'S NO ROOM INSIDE
BOYS WHO STOP STUDYING AND TURN THEIR BACKS
AS SOON AS THE BUYER HAD PAID THE FOUR CENTS THE DONKEY CHANGED HANDS HIS NEW OWNER TOOK HIM TO A HIGH CLIFF OVERLOOKING THE SEA PUT A STONE AROUND HIS NECK TIED A ROPE TO ONE OF HIS HIND FEET GAVE HIM A PUSH
THAT THEY TURNED TAIL AND RAN IN A FEW MOMENTS ALL HAD DISAPPEARED ALL EXCEPT PINOCCHIO ALTHOUGH SCARED TO DEATH BY THE HORROR OF WHAT HAD BEEN DONE HE RAN TO THE SEA AND SOAKED HIS HANDKERCHIEF IN THE COOL WATER AND WITH IT BATHED THE HEAD OF HIS POOR LITTLE SCHOOLMATE
HAS BEEN BRINGING TERROR TO THESE WATERS IS THIS SHARK VERY BIG ASKED PINOCCHIO WHO WAS BEGINNING TO TREMBLE WITH FRIGHT IS HE BIG REPLIED THE DOLPHIN JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HIS SIZE LET ME TELL YOU THAT HE IS LARGER THAN A FIVE STORY BUILDING
WHERE DID MY GOOD FRIENDS SAY THEY WOULD WAIT FOR ME HE ADDED
BUT THEY ALL ANSWERED AREN'T YOU ASHAMED INSTEAD OF BEING A BEGGAR IN THE STREETS WHY DON'T YOU LOOK FOR WORK AND EARN YOUR OWN BREAD
VERY SAD AND DOWNCAST WERE THE TWO POOR LITTLE FELLOWS AS THEY STOOD AND LOOKED AT EACH OTHER OUTSIDE THE ROOM THE LITTLE MAN GREW MORE AND MORE IMPATIENT
DURING WHICH TIME THE TWO FRIENDS

A GREAT SASH OF GOLD AND SILVER WAS FASTENED AROUND HIS WAIST AND HIS TAIL WAS DECORATED WITH RIBBONS OF MANY BRILLIANT COLORS HE WAS A HANDSOME DONKEY INDEED THE MANAGER WHEN INTRODUCING HIM TO THE PUBLIC
JUST AS PINOCCHIO STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO TAKE A HANDFUL OF THEM HE WAS AWAKENED BY THREE LOUD KNOCKS AT THE DOOR IT WAS THE INNKEEPER WHO HAD COME TO TELL HIM THAT MIDNIGHT HAD STRUCK ARE MY FRIENDS READY THE MARIONETTE ASKED HIM
HE LEARNED TO MUMBLE A FEW WORDS WHEN HE LIVED FOR THREE YEARS WITH A

BUT INSTEAD OF WORDS A LOUD BRAYING WAS HEARD IN THE THEATER SO LOUD AND SO LONG THAT ALL THE SPECTATORS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN BUT ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN BURST OUT LAUGHING
THAT BEAUTIFUL LADY IS MY FAIRY SAID PINOCCHIO TO HIMSELF RECOGNIZING HER HE FELT SO HAPPY THAT HE TRIED HIS BEST TO CRY OUT OH MY FAIRY MY OWN FAIRY

HE SEARCHED AND HE SEARCHED BUT HE SAW NOTHING EXCEPT SEA AND SKY AND FAR AWAY A FEW SAILS SO SMALL THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN BIRDS IF ONLY I KNEW THE NAME OF THIS ISLAND HE SAID TO HIMSELF
IN THE DISTANCE A SMALL LIGHT FLICKERED A QUEER SOUND COULD BE HEARD SOFT AS A LITTLE BELL AND FAINT AND MUFFLED LIKE THE

OBSERVE I BEG OF YOU THE SAVAGE LOOK OF HIS EYE ALL THE MEANS USED BY CENTURIES OF CIVILIZATION IN SUBDUING WILD BEASTS FAILED IN THIS CASE I HAD FINALLY TO RESORT TO THE GENTLE LANGUAGE OF THE WHIP
HE HAD EATEN IT ALL DURING THE NIGHT HE TRIED THE STRAW BUT AS HE CHEWED AWAY AT IT HE NOTICED TO HIS GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT THAT IT TASTED NEITHER LIKE RICE NOR LIKE MACARONI PATIENCE HE REPEATED AS HE CHEWED
LIKE A BOX OF SARDINES THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE THEY WERE PILED ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER THEY COULD HARDLY BREATHE YET NOT ONE WORD OF COMPLAINT WAS HEARD THE THOUGHT
AND DANCING GAYLY AROUND THE MARIONETTE AND THAT IS THAT WE HAVE MADE YOU STAY OUT OF SCHOOL TO COME WITH US AREN'T YOU ASHAMED OF BEING SUCH A GOODY GOODY AND OF STUDYING SO HARD YOU NEVER HAVE A BIT OF ENJOYMENT AND WHAT IS IT TO YOU IF I DO STUDY
BUT IN THE MEANTIME HE BEGAN TO FEEL HUNGRY FOR IT WAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS SINCE HE HAD EATEN WHAT WAS TO BE DONE THERE WERE ONLY TWO MEANS LEFT TO HIM IN ORDER TO GET A BITE TO EAT HE HAD EITHER TO WORK OR TO BEG

GET OUT I SAY REPEATED THE FISHERMAN AND HE DREW BACK HIS FOOT TO GIVE THE DOG A KICK THEN THE DOG WHO BEING REALLY HUNGRY WOULD TAKE NO REFUSAL
ONE OF THE BOYS TOOK HOLD OF IT AND THREW IT WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH AT PINOCCHIO'S HEAD BUT INSTEAD OF HITTING THE MARIONETTE THE BOOK STRUCK ONE OF THE OTHER BOYS WHO AS PALE AS A GHOST CRIED OUT FAINTLY OH MOTHER HELP I'M DYING AND FELL SENSELESS TO THE GROUND
AND HIS FRIEND LAMP WICK WHEN THEY SAW EACH OTHER BOTH STRICKEN BY THE SAME MISFORTUNE INSTEAD OF FEELING SORROWFUL AND ASHAMED BEGAN TO POKE FUN AT EACH OTHER AND AFTER MUCH NONSENSE
KNOCKED A SECOND TIME THIS TIME LOUDER THAN BEFORE AT THAT SECOND KNOCK A WINDOW ON THE THIRD FLOOR OPENED AND THE SAME SNAIL LOOKED OUT DEAR LITTLE SNAIL CRIED PINOCCHIO FROM THE STREET I HAVE BEEN WAITING TWO HOURS FOR YOU
CHAPTER THIRTY THREE PINOCCHIO HAVING BECOME A DONKEY IS BOUGHT BY THE OWNER OF A CIRCUS WHO WANTS TO TEACH HIM TO DO TRICKS THE DONKEY BECOMES LAME AND IS SOLD TO A MAN WHO WANTS TO USE HIS SKIN FOR A DRUMHEAD
REPEATED PINOCCHIO AND WITH WHAT WAS HE WOUNDED WITH THIS BOOK AND THE MARIONETTE PICKED UP THE ARITHMETIC TEXT TO SHOW IT TO THE OFFICER AND WHOSE BOOK IS THIS MINE ENOUGH NOT ANOTHER WORD
SAID LAMP WICK ARE YOU GOING ALONE OR WITH OTHERS ALONE THERE WILL BE MORE THAN A HUNDRED OF US WILL YOU WALK AT MIDNIGHT THE WAGON PASSES HERE THAT IS TO TAKE US
EVEN TO THE COLLEGES IF YOU MEET THEM ON THE WAY
WHAT DOES THE TEACHER THINK OF US YOU MEAN WHY DON'T YOU SEE IF YOU STUDY AND WE DON'T WE PAY FOR IT AFTER ALL IT'S ONLY FAIR TO LOOK OUT FOR OURSELVES WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO HATE SCHOOL AND BOOKS
AND AFTER THE CAULIFLOWER SOME CAKE AND JAM AT THIS LAST BRIBERY PINOCCHIO COULD NO LONGER RESIST AND SAID FIRMLY
PINOCCHIO PAID A GOLD PIECE FOR THE THREE SUPPERS AND STARTED ON HIS WAY TOWARD THE FIELD THAT WAS TO MAKE HIM A RICH MAN HE WALKED ON NOT KNOWING WHERE HE WAS GOING FOR IT WAS DARK SO DARK THAT NOT A THING WAS VISIBLE
LAMP WICK AND ALL THE OTHER BOYS WHO HAD TRAVELED WITH THEM STARTED OUT ON A TOUR OF INVESTIGATION THEY WANDERED EVERYWHERE THEY LOOKED INTO EVERY NOOK AND CORNER HOUSE AND THEATER
BLOWING OF TRUMPETS THAT IT WAS DEAFENING EVERYWHERE GROUPS OF BOYS WERE GATHERED TOGETHER SOME PLAYED AT MARBLES AT HOPSCOTCH AT BALL OTHERS RODE ON BICYCLES OR ON WOODEN HORSES SOME PLAYED AT
ADDIO FALSE FRIENDS REMEMBER THE OLD PROVERB WHICH SAYS BAD WHEAT ALWAYS MAKES POOR BREAD DO NOT ABANDON US ABANDON US REPEATED THE CAT
ROUND ABOUT HIM NOT A LEAF STIRRED A FEW BATS SKIMMED HIS NOSE NOW AND AGAIN AND SCARED HIM HALF TO DEATH
WHO IS IT SAID A LITTLE VOICE FROM WITHIN
CRIED THE BOYS FROM THE ORCHESTRA SADDENED BY THE ACCIDENT NO ONE SAW PINOCCHIO AGAIN THAT EVENING THE NEXT MORNING THE VETERINARY THAT IS THE ANIMAL DOCTOR DECLARED THAT HE WOULD BE LAME FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
A LARGE SHIP ALSO SUFFERED THE SAME FATE THE SAILORS WERE ALL SAVED BUT THE SHIP WENT RIGHT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AND THE SAME TERRIBLE SHARK THAT SWALLOWED ME SWALLOWED MOST OF IT WHAT SWALLOWED A SHIP ASKED PINOCCHIO IN ASTONISHMENT
AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF PLAY PINOCCHIO WAKES UP ONE FINE MORNING AND FINDS A GREAT SURPRISE AWAITING HIM FINALLY THE WAGON ARRIVED IT MADE NO NOISE
ROUND AND SHINY AS A BALL OF BUTTER WITH A FACE BEAMING LIKE AN APPLE A LITTLE MOUTH THAT ALWAYS SMILED AND A VOICE SMALL AND WHEEDLING LIKE THAT OF A CAT BEGGING FOR FOOD
THE SQUARES WERE FILLED WITH SMALL WOODEN THEATERS OVERFLOWING WITH BOYS FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND ON THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES
THERE HE SAW WHAT HE NEVER COULD HAVE WISHED TO SEE HIS MANLY FIGURE WAS ADORNED AND ENRICHED BY A BEAUTIFUL PAIR OF DONKEY'S EARS
ONE IS WOUNDED PINOCCHIO IS ARRESTED GOING LIKE THE WIND PINOCCHIO TOOK BUT A VERY SHORT TIME TO REACH THE SHORE HE GLANCED ALL ABOUT HIM BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF A SHARK
THE SUN CAME OUT IN FULL SPLENDOR AND THE SEA BECAME AS CALM AS A LAKE THEN THE MARIONETTE TOOK OFF HIS CLOTHES AND LAID THEM ON THE SAND TO DRY HE LOOKED OVER THE WATERS TO SEE WHETHER HE MIGHT CATCH SIGHT OF A BOAT WITH A LITTLE MAN IN IT
THE FAIRY'S WORDS HAD THROWN HIM PINOCCHIO ASKED FOR PERMISSION TO GIVE OUT THE INVITATIONS
PINOCCHIO OBEDIENTLY BENT HIS TWO KNEES TO THE GROUND AND REMAINED KNEELING UNTIL THE MANAGER WITH THE CRACK OF THE WHIP CRIED SHARPLY WALK THE DONKEY LIFTED HIMSELF ON HIS FOUR FEET AND WALKED AROUND THE RING
AT ONE GULP THE ONLY THING HE SPAT OUT WAS THE MAIN MAST
AND INSTEAD OF MAKING EIGHT BASKETS HE MADE SIXTEEN AFTER THAT HE WENT TO BED AND FELL ASLEEP AS HE SLEPT HE DREAMED OF HIS FAIRY BEAUTIFUL SMILING AND HAPPY WHO KISSED HIM AND SAID TO HIM BRAVO PINOCCHIO
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WILL YOU COME WITH US
SAID PINOCCHIO LET US SEE FOR OURSELVES
AND RECITED A FEW TURNED SOMERSAULTS OTHERS WALKED ON THEIR HANDS WITH THEIR FEET IN THE AIR GENERALS IN FULL UNIFORM LEADING REGIMENTS OF CARDBOARD SOLDIERS PASSED BY LAUGHTER SHRIEKS HOWLS
AT THE NOISE A LARGE CRAB CRAWLED SLOWLY OUT OF THE WATER AND WITH A VOICE THAT SOUNDED LIKE A TROMBONE SUFFERING FROM A COLD HE CRIED OUT
INCHES YOU MUST KNOW
NOT A BALCONY SEAT NOR A GALLERY SEAT NOT EVEN FOR THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD THE PLACE SWARMED WITH BOYS AND GIRLS OF ALL AGES AND SIZES WRIGGLING AND DANCING ABOUT IN A FEVER OF IMPATIENCE TO SEE THE FAMOUS DONKEY DANCE
ANSWERED THE MARIONETTE TURN THE KEY AND THE DOOR WILL OPEN SAID THE SAME LITTLE VOICE PINOCCHIO TURNED THE KEY AND THE DOOR OPENED AS SOON AS THEY WENT IN THEY LOOKED HERE AND THERE AND EVERYWHERE BUT SAW NO ONE
IF HE IS NOT DEAD THEN HE IS SURELY ALIVE
GREAT SPECTACLE TONIGHT LEAPS AND EXERCISES BY THE GREAT ARTISTS AND THE FAMOUS HORSES OF THE COMPANY FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE OF THE FAMOUS DONKEY CALLED PINOCCHIO THE STAR OF THE DANCE
ENJOY OURSELVES AND BE HAPPY FROM MORN TILL NIGHT AND WHY DID YOU FOLLOW THE ADVICE OF THAT FALSE FRIEND WHY
WE ARE OLD TIRED AND SICK SICK REPEATED THE CAT ADDIO FALSE FRIENDS ANSWERED THE MARIONETTE YOU CHEATED ME ONCE BUT YOU WILL NEVER CATCH ME AGAIN BELIEVE US TODAY WE ARE TRULY POOR AND STARVING
DO YOU WANT TO GO TO YOUR FATHER AND I SAID PERHAPS BUT HOW AND HE SAID GET ON MY BACK I'LL TAKE YOU THERE WE FLEW ALL NIGHT LONG AND NEXT MORNING THE FISHERMEN WERE LOOKING TOWARD THE SEA CRYING THERE IS A POOR LITTLE MAN DROWNING AND I KNEW IT WAS YOU
CAME RUNNING INTO THE CAVE GET OUT CRIED THE FISHERMAN THREATENINGLY AND STILL HOLDING ONTO THE MARIONETTE WHO WAS ALL COVERED WITH FLOUR BUT THE POOR DOG WAS VERY HUNGRY AND WHINING AND WAGGING HIS TAIL HE TRIED TO SAY
AND HERE I AM ON HEARING THIS THE TWO DONKEYS BOWED THEIR HEADS IN SHAME
BELIEVE ME IF YOU DON'T COME YOU'LL BE SORRY
THAN DONE HE APPROACHED THE FIRST DONKEY AND TRIED TO MOUNT IT BUT THE LITTLE ANIMAL TURNED SUDDENLY AND GAVE HIM SUCH A TERRIBLE KICK IN THE STOMACH THAT PINOCCHIO WAS THROWN TO THE GROUND AND FELL WITH HIS LEGS IN THE AIR AT THIS UNLOOKED FOR ENTERTAINMENT
AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SHUT AWAY IN HERE FROM THAT DAY TO THIS TWO LONG WEARY YEARS TWO YEARS MY PINOCCHIO WHICH HAVE BEEN LIKE TWO CENTURIES
FROM AN EARACHE NEVER AND YOU NEVER STILL SINCE THIS MORNING MY EAR HAS BEEN TORTURING ME
IN REWARD FOR YOUR KIND HEART I FORGIVE YOU FOR ALL YOUR OLD MISCHIEF BOYS WHO LOVE AND TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEIR PARENTS WHEN THEY ARE OLD AND SICK DESERVE PRAISE EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE HELD UP AS MODELS OF OBEDIENCE AND GOOD BEHAVIOR
WHO UNDERSTOOD THE DONKEY PERFECTLY HAW HAW HAW HAY GIVES ME A HEADACHE DO YOU PRETEND BY ANY CHANCE THAT I SHOULD FEED YOU DUCK OR CHICKEN ASKED THE MAN AGAIN
HAD ON THEIR FEET LACED SHOES MADE OF LEATHER JUST LIKE THE ONES BOYS WEAR AND THE DRIVER OF THE WAGON IMAGINE TO YOURSELVES A LITTLE FAT MAN
YOU CAN MOUNT NOW MY BOY HE THEN SAID TO PINOCCHIO HAVE NO FEAR THAT DONKEY WAS WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING BUT I HAVE SPOKEN TO HIM AND NOW HE SEEMS QUIET
HAD TAKEN EXACTLY NINE HOURS TO GO FROM THE FOURTH FLOOR TO THE STREET HOW SHE MUST HAVE RACED WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH YOUR FOOT THROUGH THE DOOR SHE ASKED THE MARIONETTE LAUGHING IT WAS A MISFORTUNE
HE WAS ONCE MORE MASTRO GEPPETTO THE WOOD CARVER HARD AT WORK ON A LOVELY PICTURE FRAME DECORATING IT WITH FLOWERS AND LEAVES AND HEADS OF ANIMALS FATHER FATHER WHAT HAS HAPPENED TELL ME IF YOU CAN
AND WHO KNOWS HE MAY STAY WHITE AFTER ALL THE SLEEPING BEAUTY WOULD NEVER HAVE HIM EVEN IF HE DID SAID DAB DAB HE LOOKED BETTER THE WAY HE WAS I THOUGHT BUT HE'D NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT UGLY
HE GROWLED THE WORST MEN I EVER SMELT I SMELL TROUBLE I SMELL A FIGHT SIX BAD SCOUNDRELS FIGHTING AGAINST ONE BRAVE MAN I WANT TO HELP HIM
SAID THE OWL SH THERE IT IS AGAIN DON'T YOU HEAR THAT NO I DO NOT SAID THE DOCTOR WHAT KIND OF A SOUND IS IT
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE BEACH THEY SAW POLYNESIA AND CHEE CHEE WAITING FOR THEM ON THE ROCKS NEAR THE SHIP I FEEL SORRY ABOUT BUMPO SAID THE DOCTOR
AND ALL THE ANIMALS ON THE SHIP BEGAN TO LAUGH AND DANCE ABOUT IN THE RUSHING AIR FOR WHEN THEY LOOKED BACK AT THE PIRATES SHIP THEY COULD SEE THAT IT WAS GROWING SMALLER NOW INSTEAD OF BIGGER
HE SAID NOT LIKE A PIRATE COULD YOU TELL ME WHERE MY UNCLE IS I AM AFRAID I CAN'T SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN DID YOU SEE HIM LAST IT WAS THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY SAID THE BOY
AND HE SAW THE CAPTAIN OF THE ARMY SNEAKING THROUGH THE TREES SO HE HURRIED AFTER THE DOCTOR AND TOLD HIM TO RUN THEN THEY ALL RAN HARDER THAN THEY HAD EVER RUN IN THEIR LIVES AND THE KING'S MEN
A SET OF BIG CHESS MEN CARVED OUT OF CORAL AND AMBER A WALKING STICK WHICH HAD A SWORD INSIDE
SUCH IGNORANCE SNIFFED TOO TOO A DROP OF WATER FALLING OFF THE CEILING WOULD HAVE MADE TEN TIMES AS MUCH NOISE WELL SAID THE DOCTOR
THEY'VE GOT THE CAPTAIN LOOSE AND HE'S COMING ON LIKE A DEER GET LIVELY
CAN'T BLAME HER FOR GETTING SCARED I WONDER WHO HE'LL GO AND KISS THIS TIME SILLY BUSINESS THEN THE PUSHMI PULLYU THE WHITE MOUSE GUB GUB DAB DAB
THEY STILL STOOD THERE UPON THE ROCKS
THE MAN IN THERE IS UNHAPPY HE WEEPS HE HAS TAKEN CARE NOT TO BLUBBER OR SNIFFLE LEST WE SHOULD FIND OUT THAT HE IS CRYING BUT I HEARD
AS SOON AS THEY HAD ALL FOUND A PLACE TO SIT SUDDENLY THERE WAS NO NOISE LEFT ANYWHERE ALL WAS QUIET ALL WAS STILL AND IN THE SILENT MOONLIGHT
DON'T MOVE WHATEVER YOU DO AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS PRINCE BUMPO THE KING'S SON OPENING THE GARDEN GATE HE CARRIED A BOOK OF FAIRY TALES UNDER HIS ARM
AND BLUNDERED INTO THE PALACE GARDEN BY MISTAKE BUT COULDN'T YOU GUIDE THEM ASKED CHEE CHEE AND HE BEGAN TO SCOLD THE PARROT FOR LETTING THEM GET LOST WHILE HE WAS AWAY LOOKING FOR THE COCOANUTS
AND PRESENTLY ALL THESE BIRDS CAME DOWN CLOSE SKIMMING OVER THE WATER AND THE LAND AND THE NIGHT SKY WAS LEFT CLEAR ABOVE AND THE MOON SHONE AS BEFORE
SAID JIP IN A WHISPER YES VERY RUM SAID GUB GUB THE SMELL MAKES ME GIDDY
CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO GET IT FOR THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE IT THEY EVEN GOT THE DOCTOR SOME TOBACCO ONE DAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED WHAT HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND WANTED TO SMOKE
AND THEY THINK THEY'RE GOOD HEARERS
SO IN THIS WAY HE WENT ON GETTING MORE AND MORE PETS ONCE WHEN HE WAS SITTING ON HIS GARDEN WALL SMOKING A PIPE IN THE EVENING AN ITALIAN ORGAN GRINDER CAME ROUND WITH A MONKEY ON A STRING
I HAVE A FEELING IT ISN'T A FRIENDLY SHIP I AM AFRAID THERE IS MORE TROUBLE COMING TO US JIP WHO WAS LYING NEAR TAKING A NAP IN THE SUN BEGAN TO GROWL AND TALK IN HIS SLEEP
THE SLOWEST HE COULD FIND I SHOULD THINK MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO WIN A RACE IN A SOUP TUREEN AS HOPE TO GET AWAY FROM THEM
THE OTHER ANIMALS IN THE HOUSE CALLED HIM CHEE CHEE WHICH IS A COMMON WORD IN MONKEY LANGUAGE MEANING GINGER AND ANOTHER TIME
LOST THE MEDICINE BAG IN THE UNDER BRUSH THERE SEEMED NO END TO THEIR TROUBLES AND NOWHERE COULD THEY COME UPON A PATH AT LAST
THEY WERE STILL BEING FOLLOWED BY THE KING'S MEN IF CHEE CHEE HAD KNOWN THIS HE WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE HIDDEN THEM AGAIN BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW IT ONE DAY CHEE CHEE CLIMBED UP A HIGH ROCK AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE TREE TOPS
AND THERE TIED TO THE DOCTOR'S SHIP WERE A THOUSAND STRINGS AND TWO THOUSAND SWALLOWS WERE PULLING ON EACH STRING ALL TERRIBLY SWIFT FLIERS
WITH HIS SHORT LEGS SOON GOT TIRED AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO CARRY HIM WHICH MADE IT PRETTY HARD WHEN THEY HAD THE TRUNK AND THE HAND BAG WITH THEM AS WELL THE KING OF THE JOLLIGINKI
USING ONLY ONE EAR THE COLOR OF A KITTEN FROM THE WAY IT WINKS IN THE DARK WELL WELL SAID THE DOCTOR YOU SURPRISE ME THAT'S VERY INTERESTING
AND THE DOCTOR ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD SEEN ANYTHING OF A MAN WITH RED HAIR AND AN ANCHOR TATTOOED ON HIS ARM
THE LITTLE BOY SEEMED RATHER FRIGHTENED TO FIND A MAN STANDING THERE BEFORE HIM AND ALL THOSE ANIMALS STARING IN THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE BROKEN DOOR BUT AS SOON AS HE SAW JOHN DOLITTLE'S FACE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MATCH HE STOPPED CRYING AND GOT UP
SHALL SCRUB MY KITCHEN FLOOR FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE SO THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS WERE LED BACK TO PRISON AND LOCKED UP AND THE DOCTOR WAS TOLD THAT IN THE MORNING
WHO WAS TAKING A NAP LISTEN WHISPERED THE PARROT WHEN JOHN DOLITTLE'S FACE APPEARED PRINCE BUMPO IS COMING HERE TO NIGHT TO SEE YOU
AND ENJOYED THE LIFE OF TRAVEL VERY MUCH BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS GLAD WHEN THE NIGHT CAME AND THEY STOPPED FOR THEIR RESTING TIME THEN THE DOCTOR USED TO MAKE A LITTLE FIRE OF STICKS
SO THEY COULD HAVE A BIG FIRE IN THE KITCHEN MOST OF THE VEGETABLES IN THE GARDEN WERE GONE AND THE REST WERE COVERED WITH SNOW
THEY EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SHUT UP IN A MENAGERIE BUT WOULD JUST BE LOOKED AT THEY TOLD HIM THAT THE DOCTOR WAS A VERY KIND MAN BUT HADN'T ANY MONEY AND PEOPLE WOULD PAY TO SEE A TWO HEADED ANIMAL AND THE DOCTOR WOULD GET RICH
OH DO BE SENSIBLE CRIED DAB DAB WHERE WOULD YOU GET ALL THE WOOD AND THE NAILS TO MAKE ONE WITH AND BESIDES WHAT ARE WE GOING TO LIVE ON WE SHALL BE POORER THAN EVER WHEN WE GET BACK CHEE CHEE'S PERFECTLY RIGHT
NOW ALL HOLD YOUR BREATH A MOMENT SO I CAN LISTEN WELL
THOSE WHO STAYED BEHIND CHEE CHEE POLYNESIA AND THE CROCODILE GREW TERRIBLY SAD FOR NEVER IN THEIR LIVES HAD THEY KNOWN ANY ONE THEY LIKED SO WELL AS DOCTOR JOHN DOLITTLE
IT ISN'T AN ALLIGATOR SAID THE DOCTOR IT'S A CROCODILE I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL IT SAID HIS SISTER IT'S A NASTY THING TO FIND UNDER THE BED I WON'T HAVE IT IN THE HOUSE
THE PIRATES SHUT ME IN THERE WHEN THEY WERE GOING OFF TO STEAL THINGS FROM ANOTHER SHIP WHEN I HEARD SOME ONE CHOPPING ON THE DOOR I DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT COULD BE I WAS VERY GLAD TO FIND IT WAS YOU
TO AWAKEN HER AS THE BOOK SAID I SHOULD TIS TRUE INDEED THAT SHE AWOKE BUT WHEN SHE SAW MY FACE SHE CRIED OUT OH HE'S BLACK AND SHE RAN AWAY AND WOULDN'T MARRY ME
MANY GREAT EXPLORERS AND GRAY BEARDED NATURALISTS HAVE LAIN LONG WEEKS HIDDEN IN THE JUNGLE WAITING TO SEE THE MONKEYS DO THAT TRICK BUT WE NEVER LET A WHITE MAN GET A GLIMPSE OF IT BEFORE YOU ARE THE FIRST TO SEE THE FAMOUS BRIDGE OF APES
TO TELL THE TRUTH I WAS SURPRISED MYSELF THAT IT WORKED SO WELL BUT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING DIDN'T I I COULDN'T POSSIBLY SCRUB THE KING'S KITCHEN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IT WAS SUCH A DIRTY KITCHEN
THE SEVENTH CHAPTER
THE DOCTOR SAW AT ONCE THAT THE MONKEY'S COLLAR WAS TOO TIGHT AND THAT HE WAS DIRTY AND UNHAPPY SO HE TOOK THE MONKEY AWAY FROM THE ITALIAN GAVE THE MAN A SHILLING AND TOLD HIM TO GO
I DO BELIEVE THERE'S SOME ONE IN THERE THEY ALL KEPT STILL A MOMENT THEN THE DOCTOR SAID YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN TOO TOO I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING
OF THE DAYS WHEN MEN DRESSED IN BEAR SKINS AND LIVED IN HOLES IN THE ROCK AND ATE THEIR MUTTON RAW BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT COOKING WAS HAVING NEVER SEEN A FIRE
AND WENT UPSTAIRS TO LOOK FOR PASSING PORPOISES AND SOON A WHOLE SCHOOL CAME DANCING AND JUMPING THROUGH THE WATER ON THEIR WAY TO BRAZIL WHEN THEY SAW THE DOCTOR LEANING ON THE RAIL OF HIS SHIP THEY CAME OVER TO SEE HOW HE WAS GETTING ON
AFTERWARDS WHEN THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS WERE GOING ON ALONE POLYNESIA SAID WE MUST TREAD SOFTLY AND TALK LOW AS WE GO THROUGH THE LAND OF THE JOLLIGINKI
THESE MONKEYS MADE A TREMENDOUS NOISE CHEERING AND WAVING LEAVES AND SWINGING OUT OF THE BRANCHES TO GREET HIM THEY WANTED TO CARRY HIS BAG AND HIS TRUNK AND EVERYTHING HE HAD AND ONE OF THE BIGGER ONES EVEN CARRIED GUB GUB
THERE LIES A FAMOUS WIZARD JOHN DOLITTLE BY NAME MANY THINGS HE KNOWS OF MEDICINE AND MAGIC AND MIGHTY DEEDS HAS HE PERFORMED
TO TURN HIM WHITE BUT BE SURE TO MAKE HIM PROMISE YOU FIRST THAT HE WILL OPEN THE PRISON DOOR AND FIND A SHIP FOR YOU TO CROSS THE SEA IN THIS IS ALL VERY WELL SAID THE DOCTOR
AND THAT'S SOMETHING PERHAPS WE CAN FIND HIM FOR YOU FIRST WE'LL GO AND HAVE TEA WITH STRAWBERRY JAM
THE OCEAN GOSSIPS RIGHT AWAY AN AXE WAS FOUND AND THE DOCTOR SOON CHOPPED A HOLE IN THE DOOR BIG ENOUGH TO CLAMBER THROUGH AT FIRST HE COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL IT WAS SO DARK INSIDE SO HE STRUCK A MATCH
GETTING THEIR CLOTHES TORN AND THEIR FACES COVERED WITH MUD THEY WALKED RIGHT INTO THE KING'S BACK GARDEN BY MISTAKE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUNNING UP AT ONCE AND CAUGHT THEM
BUT WHEN THEY DO THEIR LONG HAIR MAKES QUITE A DIFFERENT SOUND
AND COULD PAY FOR THE BOAT HE HAD BORROWED TO COME TO AFRICA IN BUT HE ANSWERED NO YOU KNOW HOW SHY I AM I HATE BEING STARED AT AND HE ALMOST BEGAN TO CRY
YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF MEDICINES LEFT IN THE BAG HE'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU IF YOU CHANGE HIS COLOR IT IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO GET OUT OF PRISON WELL
EVERYBODY QUITE STILL SHUT YOUR EYES AND DON'T BREATHE TOO TOO LEANED DOWN AND LISTENED AGAIN VERY HARD AND LONG AT LAST HE LOOKED UP INTO THE DOCTOR'S FACE AND SAID
THEN THEY USED TO MAKE THE PEOPLE THEY HAD CAUGHT WRITE HOME TO THEIR FRIENDS FOR MONEY AND IF THE FRIENDS SENT NO MONEY THE PIRATES OFTEN THREW THE PEOPLE INTO THE SEA
FAREWELL FAREWELL CRIED THE PRINCE A THOUSAND THANKS GOOD TRIPSITINKA AND HE SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT AGAIN WITH A SMILE UPON HIS FACE
AND THE LITTLE BOY BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN WELL NOW WAIT A MINUTE SAID THE DOCTOR DON'T CRY LET'S GO AND HAVE TEA IN THE DINING ROOM AND WE'LL TALK IT OVER MAYBE YOUR UNCLE IS QUITE SAFE ALL THE TIME
TOO TOO THE LISTENER HAVING THANKED THE SHARKS AGAIN FOR THEIR KINDNESS THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS SET OFF ONCE MORE ON THEIR JOURNEY HOME IN THE SWIFT SHIP WITH THE THREE RED SAILS AS THEY MOVED OUT INTO THE OPEN SEA
DON'T BE SO FUSSY I TELL YOU I WILL NOT HAVE HIM AROUND SAID SARAH HE EATS THE LINOLEUM IF YOU DON'T SEND HIM AWAY THIS MINUTE I'LL I'LL GO AND GET MARRIED ALL RIGHT SAID THE DOCTOR
NO SOUND BUT THIS GREAT RUSTLING OF FEATHERS WHICH GREW GREATER NOW THAN EVER WHEN THEY BEGAN TO SETTLE ON THE SANDS ALONG THE ROPES OF THE SHIP
HE CAME STROLLING DOWN THE GRAVEL WALK HUMMING A SAD SONG TILL HE REACHED A STONE SEAT RIGHT UNDER THE TREE WHERE THE PARROT AND THE MONKEY WERE HIDING THEN HE LAY DOWN ON THE SEAT
THAT FOR A LITTLE THEY COVERED THE WHOLE MOON SO IT COULD NOT SHINE AND THE SEA GREW DARK AND BLACK LIKE WHEN A STORM CLOUD PASSES OVER THE SUN
AND ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT AND DRINK AFTER THEY HAD ALL FINISHED EATING THE DOCTOR GOT UP AND SAID MY FRIENDS I AM NOT CLEVER AT SPEAKING LONG WORDS AFTER DINNER LIKE SOME MEN
IT IS VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU NOW WE NEED NOT BE AFRAID THAT WE WILL LOSE OUR WAY UPON THE SEA PULL UP THE ANCHOR AND SET THE SAIL WHEN THE SHIP MOVED OUT UPON THE WATER
THEY ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD GO WITH DOCTOR DOLITTLE AND BE PUT ON SHOW IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN BUT HE SHOOK BOTH HIS HEADS HARD AND SAID CERTAINLY NOT
MONEY IS A NUISANCE HE USED TO SAY WE'D ALL BE MUCH BETTER OFF IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN INVENTED WHAT DOES MONEY MATTER SO LONG AS WE ARE HAPPY BUT SOON THE ANIMALS THEMSELVES BEGAN TO GET WORRIED
AND WHEN THEY HAD GONE INTO THE SHIP'S DINING ROOM AND WERE HAVING TEA DAB DAB CAME UP BEHIND THE DOCTOR'S CHAIR AND WHISPERED ASK THE PORPOISES IF THE BOY'S UNCLE WAS DROWNED THEY'LL KNOW ALL RIGHT SAID THE DOCTOR
AND WHILE HE WAS AWAY THE DOCTOR AND THE REST OF THE ANIMALS
HE ISN'T DROWNED SAID THE PORPOISES IF HE WERE WE WOULD BE SURE TO HAVE HEARD OF IT FROM THE DEEP SEA DECAPODS WE HEAR ALL THE SALT WATER NEWS THE SHELL FISH CALL US THE OCEAN GOSSIPS NO TELL THE LITTLE BOY WE ARE SORRY WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE HIS UNCLE IS
THE ANIMALS ALL WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT THEIR NEW BOAT WAS LIKE INSIDE WHILE THE DOCTOR LEANT ON THE RAIL AT THE BACK OF THE SHIP WITH A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH WATCHING THE CANARY ISLANDS FADE AWAY IN THE BLUE DUSK OF THE EVENING
SAID THE DOCTOR IS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO GET ANOTHER BOAT TO GO HOME IN OH WELL PERHAPS WE'LL FIND ONE LYING ABOUT ON THE BEACH THAT NOBODY IS USING NEVER LIFT YOUR FOOT
AND ONE EVENING WHEN THE DOCTOR WAS ASLEEP IN HIS CHAIR BEFORE THE KITCHEN FIRE THEY BEGAN TALKING IT OVER AMONG THEMSELVES IN WHISPERS AND THE OWL TOO TOO WHO WAS GOOD AT ARITHMETIC
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY FOR HIS ARMY TO FIND THEM BECAUSE THE DOCTOR WAS IN A STRANGE LAND AND WOULD NOT KNOW HIS WAY BUT HE WAS WRONG BECAUSE THE MONKEY CHEE CHEE KNEW ALL THE PATHS THROUGH THE JUNGLE BETTER EVEN THAN THE KING'S MEN DID
RANG FROM YONDER BOWER STRANGE WORTHY PRINCE SAID POLYNESIA KEEPING VERY STILL SO BUMPO COULDN'T SEE HER THOU SAYEST WINGED
HE WAS POORER THAN HE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE WITH ALL THESE MOUTHS TO FILL AND THE HOUSE TO LOOK AFTER AND NO ONE TO DO THE MENDING AND NO MONEY COMING IN TO PAY THE BUTCHER'S BILL THINGS BEGAN TO LOOK VERY DIFFICULT BUT THE DOCTOR DIDN'T WORRY AT ALL
WERE NEARLY ALWAYS SORRY FOR IT AFTERWARDS PRESENTLY SHE SPIED CHEE CHEE SWINGING THROUGH THE TREES STILL LOOKING FOR THE DOCTOR WHEN CHEE CHEE SAW HER HE CAME INTO HER TREE
SAID THE DOCTOR LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE BOTTLES IN HIS MEDICINE BAG SUPPOSING I MADE YOUR HAIR A NICE BLONDE COLOR WOULD NOT THAT DO INSTEAD TO MAKE YOU HAPPY NO SAID BUMPO
AND THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE ACROSS THE RIVER AND JIP THE DOG LOOKED DOWN OVER THE EDGE OF THE STEEP STEEP CLIFF AND SAID GOLLY HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET ACROSS
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT SAID POLYNESIA IMPATIENTLY BUT YOU MUST
THIS DOCTOR SAID CHEE CHEE IS THE PUSHMI PULLYU THE RAREST ANIMAL OF THE AFRICAN JUNGLES THE ONLY TWO HEADED BEAST IN THE WORLD TAKE HIM HOME WITH YOU
THEY STUMBLED INTO WET BOGGY PLACES THEY GOT ALL TANGLED UP IN THICK CONVOLVULUS RUNNERS THEY SCRATCHED THEMSELVES ON THORNS AND TWICE THEY NEARLY
BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD VERY LONG EARS THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS VERY SHORT AND AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HOLD OF THE DOCTOR ONE OF HIS EARS CAUGHT FAST IN A TREE
THE NOISE GREW LOUDER AND BIGGER IT SEEMED TO BE COMING NEARER TO THEM A SOUND LIKE THE AUTUMN WIND BLOWING THROUGH THE LEAVES OF A POPLAR TREE OR A GREAT
SAID THE DOCTOR QUICKLY WELL I WILL DO WHAT I CAN FOR YOU YOU WILL HAVE TO BE VERY PATIENT THOUGH YOU KNOW WITH SOME MEDICINES YOU CAN NEVER BE VERY SURE I MIGHT HAVE TO TRY TWO OR THREE TIMES
RIGHT UP TO THE EARS HE HELD IT THERE A LONG TIME SO LONG THAT THE DOCTOR SEEMED TO GET DREADFULLY ANXIOUS AND FIDGETY STANDING FIRST ON ONE LEG AND THEN ON THE OTHER
BUT IT ISN'T SO EASY TO TURN A BLACK MAN WHITE YOU SPEAK AS THOUGH HE WERE A DRESS TO BE RE DYED IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE SHALL THE LEOPARD CHANGE HIS SPOTS OR THE ETHIOPIAN HIS SKIN
BUT THE DOCTOR TOLD HIM THAT IF HE DIDN'T GO AWAY HE WOULD PUNCH HIM ON THE NOSE JOHN DOLITTLE WAS A STRONG MAN THOUGH HE WASN'T VERY TALL
AND HE LED THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS TO THE VERY THICKEST PART OF THE FOREST A PLACE WHERE NO MAN HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE AND HID THEM ALL IN A BIG HOLLOW TREE BETWEEN HIGH ROCKS
SO YOU ARE CAUGHT AGAIN THIS TIME YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE TAKE THEM ALL BACK TO PRISON AND PUT DOUBLE LOCKS ON THE DOOR
GO AND GET MARRIED IT CAN'T BE HELPED AND HE TOOK DOWN HIS HAT AND WENT OUT INTO THE GARDEN SO SARAH DOLITTLE PACKED UP HER THINGS AND WENT OFF AND THE DOCTOR WAS LEFT ALL ALONE WITH HIS ANIMAL FAMILY AND VERY SOON
BUT POLYNESIA FLEW INTO A TREE IN THE GARDEN WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING HER AND HID HERSELF
I DON'T BELIEVE THE POOR BOOBY FOUND THE SLEEPING BEAUTY AT ALL SAID JIP THE DOG MOST LIKELY HE KISSED SOME FARMER'S FAT WIFE WHO WAS TAKING A SNOOZE UNDER AN APPLE TREE
WAS PACKED OFF TO HELP THE SOLDIERS IN THEIR SEARCH ALL THIS TIME THE DOCTOR AND HIS ANIMALS WERE RUNNING THROUGH THE FOREST TOWARDS THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS AS FAST AS THEY COULD GO GUB GUB
HE CALLED EVERYBODY A FOOL HE THREW HIS TOOTH BRUSH AT THE PALACE CAT HE RUSHED ROUND IN HIS NIGHT SHIRT AND WOKE UP ALL HIS ARMY AND SENT THEM INTO THE JUNGLE TO CATCH THE DOCTOR
I WENT IN SEARCH OF THE SLEEPING BEAUTY WHOM I HAD READ OF IN A BOOK AND HAVING TRAVELED THROUGH THE WORLD MANY DAYS I AT LAST FOUND HER
IT WAS ALL THAT STUPID PIG'S FAULT SAID POLYNESIA HE WOULD KEEP RUNNING OFF THE PATH HUNTING FOR GINGER ROOTS AND I WAS KEPT SO BUSY
THE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES THAT SPEAK TO THEE I AM HIDING IN A ROSE BUD OH TELL ME FAIRY QUEEN CRIED BUMPO CLASPING HIS HANDS IN JOY
COMING AFTER THEM BEGAN TO RUN TOO AND THE CAPTAIN RAN HARDEST OF ALL THEN THE DOCTOR TRIPPED OVER HIS MEDICINE BAG AND FELL DOWN IN THE MUD AND THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT HE WOULD SURELY CATCH HIM THIS TIME
I SUPPOSE IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE SAID THE DOCTOR LET ME SEE AND HE WENT OVER TO HIS MEDICINE BAG MURMURING SOMETHING ABOUT LIBERATED CHLORINE ON ANIMAL PIGMENT
I MUST BE A WHITE PRINCE YOU KNOW IT IS VERY HARD TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF A PRINCE SAID THE DOCTOR ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS A MAGICIAN CAN DO
BUT EVEN WHILE HE WAS WONDERING THEY HEARD A STRANGE WHISPERING NOISE HIGH IN THE AIR COMING THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THE ANIMALS ALL STOPPED SAYING GOOD BY AND LISTENED
BUT YOU COULD NOT DO THIS WITH THE PUSHMI PULLYU BECAUSE NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU CAME TOWARDS HIM HE WAS ALWAYS FACING YOU AND BESIDES ONLY ONE HALF OF HIM SLEPT AT A TIME THE OTHER HEAD WAS ALWAYS AWAKE
IT IS FOR OUR SAKES THAT THE OLD MAN FINDS HIMSELF SO LONELY AND SO POOR SO IT WAS AGREED THAT THE MONKEY CHEE CHEE WAS TO DO THE COOKING AND MENDING THE DOG WAS TO SWEEP THE FLOORS THE DUCK WAS TO DUST AND MAKE THE BEDS
SH THE DOCTOR WHISPERED THAT IS THE PUSHMI PULLYU DON'T LET HIM SEE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM HE GETS SO DREADFULLY EMBARRASSED TELL ME HOW DID YOU COME TO BE LOCKED UP IN THAT LITTLE ROOM
I HEAR THE NOISE OF SOME ONE PUTTING HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET SAID THE OWL BUT THAT MAKES HARDLY ANY SOUND AT ALL SAID THE DOCTOR YOU COULDN'T HEAR THAT OUT HERE
SO LONG AS THE HENS LAY EGGS AND THE COW GIVES MILK WE CAN HAVE OMELETTES AND JUNKET AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF VEGETABLES LEFT IN THE GARDEN THE WINTER IS STILL A LONG WAY OFF DON'T FUSS THAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH SARAH SHE WOULD FUSS
I HAD NO IDEA THAT WE HAD BEEN IN AFRICA SO LONG IT WILL BE NEARLY SUMMER WHEN WE GET HOME FOR THESE ARE THE SWALLOWS GOING BACK SWALLOWS I THANK YOU FOR WAITING FOR US
TALKING IN A SMALL HIGH VOICE LIKE A LITTLE GIRL SAID ALOUD BUMPO SOME ONE MIGHT TURN THEE INTO A WHITE PRINCE PERCHANCE THE KING'S SON
SAID THE PORPOISES FOR WE SAW IT LYING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA BUT THERE WAS NOBODY INSIDE IT BECAUSE WE WENT AND LOOKED HIS LITTLE NEPHEW IS ON THE SHIP WITH ME HERE SAID THE DOCTOR AND HE IS TERRIBLY AFRAID THAT THE PIRATES THREW HIS UNCLE INTO THE SEA
THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY ALL THE BILLS AND STILL THE DOCTOR WOULDN'T WORRY WHEN THE PARROT CAME TO HIM AND TOLD HIM THAT THE FISHMONGER WOULDN'T GIVE THEM ANY MORE FISH HE SAID NEVER MIND
HE SAID HE WOULD COME WITH THEM AND SEE WHAT KIND OF A MAN THE DOCTOR WAS FIRST SO THE MONKEYS TRAVELED BACK WITH THE PUSHMI PULLYU AND WHEN THEY CAME TO WHERE THE DOCTOR'S LITTLE HOUSE OF GRASS WAS THEY KNOCKED ON THE DOOR THE DUCK
AND YOUR FORTUNE'S MADE PEOPLE WILL PAY ANY MONEY TO SEE HIM BUT I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY SAID THE DOCTOR YES YOU DO SAID DAB DAB THE DUCK
EMBROIDERED WITH FLOWERS OF GOLD JARS OF FINE TOBACCO FROM JAMAICA CARVED IVORY BOXES FULL OF RUSSIAN TEA AN OLD VIOLIN WITH A STRING BROKEN AND A PICTURE ON THE BACK
DOOR LOCKED AND WE ARE ALL CRAZY TO GET IN AND SEE WHAT'S INSIDE JIP SAYS IT MUST BE WHERE THE PIRATES KEPT THEIR TREASURE BUT WE
AND BEGAN READING THE FAIRY STORIES TO HIMSELF CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA WATCHED HIM KEEPING VERY QUIET AND STILL
I WONDER HOW SARAH'S GETTING ON AN EXCELLENT WOMAN IN SOME WAYS WELL WELL BUT THE SNOW CAME EARLIER THAN USUAL THAT YEAR AND ALTHOUGH THE OLD LAME HORSE HAULED IN PLENTY OF WOOD FROM THE FOREST OUTSIDE THE TOWN
WHEN THE PIRATES CAME AND CAUGHT US THEY SUNK OUR FISHING BOAT AND BROUGHT US BOTH ON TO THIS SHIP THEY TOLD MY UNCLE THAT THEY WANTED HIM TO BE A PIRATE LIKE THEM FOR HE WAS CLEVER AT SAILING A SHIP IN ALL WEATHERS
SAID DAB DAB THE ROAST BEEF MUST BE ON THAT OTHER SHIP OVER THERE BUT THAT'S TEN MILES AWAY SAID THE DOCTOR HE COULDN'T SMELL THAT FAR SURELY OH YES HE COULD SAID DAB DAB
THEY LOOKED IN ALL THE CUPBOARDS AND DRAWERS AND LOCKERS IN THE BIG CHESTS IN THE SHIP'S DINING ROOM THEY LOOKED EVERYWHERE WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS THEY DISCOVERED A LOT OF NEW AND WONDERFUL THINGS THAT THE PIRATES MUST HAVE STOLEN FROM OTHER SHIPS
THE BOAT DID NOT GO NEARLY AS FAST AS THE PIRATES' WHICH KEPT COMING ON BEHIND CLOSER AND CLOSER THIS IS A POOR SHIP THE PRINCE GAVE US SAID GUB GUB THE PIG
AND SOON NOW THE DOCTOR BEGAN TO MAKE MONEY AGAIN AND HIS SISTER SARAH BOUGHT A NEW DRESS AND WAS HAPPY SOME OF THE ANIMALS WHO CAME TO SEE HIM WERE SO SICK THAT THEY HAD TO STAY AT THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE FOR A WEEK
LORD SAVE US CRIED THE DUCK HOW DOES IT MAKE UP ITS MIND IT DOESN'T LOOK TO ME AS THOUGH IT HAD ANY SAID JIP THE DOG
IF THE KING SHOULD HEAR US HE WILL SEND HIS SOLDIERS TO CATCH US AGAIN FOR I AM SURE HE IS STILL VERY ANGRY OVER THE TRICK I PLAYED ON HIM WHAT I AM WONDERING
WAS SO THICK WITH BUSHES AND CREEPERS AND VINES THAT SOMETIMES THEY COULD HARDLY MOVE AT ALL AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO TAKE OUT HIS POCKET KNIFE AND CUT HIS WAY ALONG
WHEN THE PACKING WAS FINISHED AND EVERYTHING WAS READY TO START THE MONKEYS GAVE A GRAND PARTY FOR THE DOCTOR AND ALL THE ANIMALS OF THE JUNGLE CAME AND THEY HAD PINEAPPLES AND MANGOES AND HONEY
PARDON ME BUT I CAN SAID TOO TOO I TELL YOU THERE IS SOME ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR PUTTING HIS HAND IN HIS POCKET ALMOST
TO THE ABYSSINIAN GAZELLES AND THE ASIATIC CHAMOIS ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE MY FATHER'S GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS THE LAST OF THE UNICORNS MOST INTERESTING MURMURED THE DOCTOR
WHEN THE DOCTOR STOPPED SPEAKING AND SAT DOWN ALL THE MONKEYS CLAPPED THEIR HANDS A LONG TIME AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER LET IT BE REMEMBERED ALWAYS AMONG OUR PEOPLE THAT HE SAT AND ATE WITH US HERE UNDER THE TREES
HE NEEDED IT TO SHAVE WITH THEN THE PRINCE TAKING A BUNCH OF COPPER KEYS FROM HIS POCKET UNDID THE GREAT DOUBLE LOCKS AND THE DOCTOR WITH ALL HIS ANIMALS
SIX WINE GLASSES WITH TURQUOISE AND SILVER ROUND THE RIMS AND A LOVELY GREAT SUGAR BOWL MADE OF MOTHER O PEARL BUT NOWHERE IN THE WHOLE BOAT COULD THEY FIND A KEY TO FIT THAT LOCK
THE OWL TOO TOO WAS TO KEEP THE ACCOUNTS AND THE PIG WAS TO DO THE GARDENING THEY MADE POLYNESIA THE PARROT HOUSEKEEPER AND LAUNDRESS BECAUSE SHE WAS THE OLDEST
EXCUSE ME SURELY YOU ARE RELATED TO THE DEER FAMILY ARE YOU NOT YES
HE MUST BEGIN SCRUBBING THE KITCHEN FLOOR THEY WERE ALL VERY UNHAPPY THIS IS A GREAT NUISANCE SAID THE DOCTOR
THE TWELFTH CHAPTER
NOW THE FARMERS AND THE OLD LADIES ARE AFRAID TO SEND THEIR ANIMALS TO YOU JUST AS WE WERE BEGINNING TO BE WELL OFF AGAIN NOW WE SHALL BE RUINED ENTIRELY THIS IS THE LAST STRAW I WILL NO LONGER BE HOUSEKEEPER FOR YOU IF YOU DON'T SEND AWAY THAT ALLIGATOR
CAN'T THE OTHER HEAD TALK AS WELL OH YES SAID THE PUSHMI PULLYU BUT I KEEP THE OTHER MOUTH FOR EATING MOSTLY IN THAT WAY I CAN TALK WHILE I AM EATING WITHOUT BEING RUDE OUR PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY POLITE
HE CLIMBED HIGH TREES AND LOOKED OUT FROM THE TOP BRANCHES TO TRY AND SEE THE DOCTOR'S HIGH HAT HE WAVED AND SHOUTED HE CALLED TO ALL THE ANIMALS BY NAME BUT IT WAS NO USE
TO BRING A BASIN THEN HE MIXED A LOT OF MEDICINES IN THE BASIN AND TOLD BUMPO TO DIP HIS FACE IN IT THE PRINCE LEANED DOWN AND PUT HIS FACE IN
THEY ALL LOOKED UP AND THERE STREAMING ACROSS THE FACE OF THE MOON
AND HE TOOK A BOOK OUT OF THE TRUNK WHICH DAB DAB WAS PACKING AND BEGAN TURNING THE PAGES LET US SEE IF BUFFON SAYS ANYTHING
THIS IS DAB DAB ONE OF MY PETS I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT DUCKS HAD A LANGUAGE SAID THE BOY ARE ALL THESE OTHER ANIMALS YOUR PETS TOO WHAT IS THAT STRANGE LOOKING THING WITH TWO HEADS
THE LAND WHERE THEY WERE BORN AND WHEN THE DOCTOR STOOD UPON THE BOAT HE LOOKED OVER THE SIDE ACROSS THE WATER AND THEN HE REMEMBERED
USED TO WAIT FOR SAILORS TO BE SHIPWRECKED ON THEIR SHORES AND OFTEN IF THEY SAW A BOAT PASSING THEY WOULD COME OUT IN THEIR FAST SAILING SHIPS AND CHASE IT WHEN THEY CAUGHT A BOAT
SPREAD THICK WELL THAT NIGHT PRINCE BUMPO CAME SECRETLY TO THE DOCTOR IN PRISON AND SAID TO HIM WHITE MAN I AM AN UNHAPPY PRINCE YEARS AGO
THE WIDE WIDE SEA LOOKED TERRIBLY BIG AND LONESOME IN THE MOONLIGHT AND HE BEGAN TO WONDER IF THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR WAY WHEN THEY PASSED OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND
WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT NOW COME OVER HERE BY THE LIGHT OH BUT BEFORE I DO ANYTHING YOU MUST FIRST GO DOWN TO THE BEACH AND GET A SHIP READY WITH FOOD IN IT TO TAKE ME ACROSS THE SEA
WHILE HE WAS STANDING THERE WONDERING HOW THE MONKEYS WERE GETTING ON AND WHAT HIS GARDEN WOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN HE GOT BACK TO PUDDLEBY
AND MAKE THEM INTO A LOT OF THIN STRINGS AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD THEN THE ENDS OF THESE STRINGS WERE TIED ON TO THE FRONT OF THE SHIP AND THE SWALLOWS TOOK HOLD OF THE STRINGS WITH THEIR FEET
I SUPPOSE HE IS SAID DAB DAB ALL DOGS CAN SMELL IN THEIR SLEEP BUT WHAT IS HE SMELLING ASKED THE DOCTOR THERE IS NO ROAST BEEF COOKING ON OUR SHIP NO
SO THE PRINCE PROMISED AND WENT AWAY TO GET A SHIP READY AT THE SEASHORE WHEN HE CAME BACK AND SAID THAT IT WAS DONE THE DOCTOR ASKED DAB DAB
YOU ASK HIM THEN JIP STILL FAST ASLEEP BEGAN TO GROWL AGAIN AND HIS LIP CURLED UP ANGRILY SHOWING HIS CLEAN WHITE TEETH I SMELL BAD MEN
ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE EXCEPT THE TREES THE DOCTOR COULD SEE THAT THEY HAD BLUE WINGS AND WHITE BREASTS AND VERY SHORT FEATHERED LEGS
REALLY WANT TO GO ABROAD YES I'LL GO SAID THE PUSHMI PULLYU WHO SAW AT ONCE FROM THE DOCTOR'S FACE THAT HE WAS A MAN TO BE TRUSTED YOU HAVE BEEN SO KIND TO THE ANIMALS HERE
AND SO DID ALL OF THEM JOHN DOLITTLE WAS THE LAST TO CROSS AND JUST AS HE WAS GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUSHING UP TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF THEN THEY SHOOK THEIR FISTS AND YELLED WITH RAGE
IT MEANT THAT SOMEBODY HAD BEEN MAKING TROUBLE AND SHE WAS THINKING OUT SOME WAY TO PUT THINGS RIGHT PEOPLE WHO MADE TROUBLE FOR POLYNESIA OR HER FRIENDS
THE CROCODILE WHO HAD A BAD TOOTH ACHE ESCAPED AT NIGHT AND CAME INTO THE DOCTOR'S GARDEN THE DOCTOR TALKED TO HIM IN CROCODILE LANGUAGE AND TOOK HIM INTO THE HOUSE AND MADE HIS TOOTH BETTER BUT WHEN THE CROCODILE SAW WHAT A NICE HOUSE IT WAS
THAT POOR SAILOR WILL THINK I'VE STOLEN HIS SHIP IF I DON'T GET HOME SOON I WONDER IF THOSE HINGES ARE LOOSE BUT THE DOOR WAS VERY STRONG AND FIRMLY LOCKED
POLYNESIA THEN SLIPPED OUT AT THE BACK OF THE TREE AND FLEW ACROSS TO THE PRISON SHE FOUND GUB GUB POKING HIS NOSE THROUGH THE BARS OF THE WINDOW
BUT BEFORE THEY COULD GET INTO THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS THEY CAME TO A STEEP CLIFF WITH A RIVER FLOWING BELOW THIS WAS THE END OF THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI
THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS STARTED OUT TO GO BACK TO THE SEASHORE
WOULD YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO FIND OUT FOR ME FOR SURE WHETHER HE HAS BEEN DROWNED OR NOT
AND FETCH ME ALL THE SAILS YOU SEE THE DOG HURRIED DOWNSTAIRS AND DRAGGED UP EVERY SAIL HE COULD FIND BUT EVEN WHEN ALL THESE WERE PUT UP ON THE MASTS TO CATCH THE WIND
BY THE EDGE OF THE RIVER THEY STOPPED AND SAID FAREWELL THIS TOOK A LONG TIME BECAUSE ALL THOSE THOUSANDS OF MONKEYS WANTED TO SHAKE JOHN DOLITTLE BY THE HAND
IF THE POOR FELLOW'S UNHAPPY WE'VE GOT TO GET IN AND SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM
FOR SURELY HE IS THE GREATEST OF MEN AND THE GRAND GORILLA WHO HAD THE STRENGTH OF SEVEN HORSES IN HIS HAIRY ARMS ROLLED A GREAT ROCK UP TO THE HEAD OF THE TABLE AND SAID THIS STONE
THE DOCTOR TURNED THE HANDLE BUT IT WOULDN'T OPEN THEN THEY ALL STARTED TO HUNT FOR THE KEY THEY LOOKED UNDER THE MAT
HE MAY KNOW THAT
AND RAINING SO HEAVILY AND BLOWING SO HARD THAT THE WALLS OF THE COTTAGE SHOOK AGAIN THEY WERE ALL SITTING TOGETHER BY THE FIRESIDE EACH OF THEM BUSY WITH SOMETHING OR OTHER
DO WISH YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PROUD WHAT MAKES YOU DESPISE ALL THESE NICE KINGS I WISH YOU TO MARRY ONE OF THEM AND YOU DO NOT TRY TO PLEASE ME I AM SO HAPPY BELLISSIMA ANSWERED
BUT NO THAT COULD NOT BE
SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS I WISHED TO TALK TO THE FAIRY DO NOT GIVE YOURSELF ANY FURTHER TROUBLE PRINCESS ANSWERED THE DWARF I CAN TELL YOU ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW BETTER THAN SHE COULD
HOW IS THIS WHY DO YOU WASTE YOUR PITY ON THESE PRINCES WHO LOVE YOU SO MUCH THAT ALL THEIR TROUBLE WOULD BE WELL REPAID BY A SINGLE SMILE FROM YOU I SHOULD BE SORRY ANSWERED BELLISSIMA
JUST THAT HE MIGHT NOT FEEL THAT HE WAS A PRISONER BUT HE FELT SURE THAT SHE HAD NOT REALLY GONE QUITE AWAY BUT WAS WATCHING HIM FROM SOME HIDING PLACE SO WALKING UP TO A GREAT MIRROR HE SAID TO IT
AND WITH LONG SNAKES COILED ROUND HER NECK HAD GIVEN HER SUCH A BLOW WITH THE LANCE SHE CARRIED THAT BELLISSIMA FELL INTO THE QUEEN'S ARMS BLEEDING AND SENSELESS HER FOND MOTHER FEELING AS MUCH HURT BY THE BLOW AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF
WHAT IS THE GOOD OF MY BEING RULER OF A GREAT KINGDOM IF I AM NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO BEAT MY OWN DOG
SO SHE SEATED HERSELF ON HIS BACK AND OFF HE WENT FROM HIS HOUSE IN GREAT HASTE AND THEY WERE NOT LONG ON THE WAY
IT HAD PILLOWS OF SILK AND CURTAINS OF SILK FRINGED WITH GOLD AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THE ROOM WAS OF GOLD OR SILVER BUT WHEN SHE HAD LAIN DOWN AND PUT OUT THE LIGHT
BUT DO NOT FORGET WHAT I SAID TO YOU OR YOU WILL DO MUCH HARM BOTH TO YOURSELF AND ME NO INDEED SAID SHE I SHALL NEVER FORGET
AND SECRETLY PROMISED HIM A PIECE OF GOLD IF HE WOULD DO SOMETHING FOR HER THERE WAS IN THE TOWN A LARGE DARK GATE THROUGH WHICH SHE HAD TO PASS NIGHT AND MORNING WITH THE GEESE WOULD HE KINDLY HANG UP FALADA'S HEAD THERE THAT SHE MIGHT SEE IT ONCE AGAIN
AND IT WAS SO DARK THAT THEY COULD SCARCELY SEE AT ALL THE THUNDER CRASHED AND THE LIGHTNING SEEMED AS IF IT MUST BURN UP EVERYTHING THE TWO BASILISKS APPEARED
AND ALL THE LITTLE TROLLS MUST HAVE BURST TOO FOR THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN HEARD OF SINCE THE PRINCE AND HIS BRIDE SET FREE ALL THE CHRISTIAN FOLK WHO WERE IMPRISONED THERE
AND HE AGAIN SLEEPIT TILL MORNING
THAT I AM NOT SAID SHE KEEP TIGHT HOLD OF MY FUR AND THEN THERE IS NO DANGER SAID HE AND THUS SHE RODE FAR FAR AWAY
SO LITTLE DID SHE CARE YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW HARD HEARTED HER LOVERS THOUGHT HER AND THE QUEEN WHO WISHED TO SEE HER MARRIED DID NOT KNOW HOW TO PERSUADE HER TO THINK OF IT SERIOUSLY BELLISSIMA SHE SAID I
AND HER MOTHER WHO WAS GETTING REALLY ANGRY AT HER DETERMINATION NOT TO BE MARRIED BEGAN TO WISH THAT SHE HAD NOT ALLOWED HER TO HAVE HER OWN WAY SO MUCH AT LAST NOT KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO DO
IF YOU WOULD BUT PROMISE ME NEVER TO TALK WITH YOUR MOTHER ALONE BUT ONLY WHEN THE OTHERS ARE THERE TOO
THE SLAUGHTERER SAID HE WOULD DO AS SHE DESIRED CHOPPED OFF THE HEAD AND NAILED IT FIRMLY OVER THE GATEWAY
SAE GLAD WAS SHE THAT HER COMPANION WAS VICTORIOUS THE BULL RETURNED AND SOUGHT FOR BUT NEVER COULD FIND HER LANG SHE SAT AND AYE SHE GRAT
WHO WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE HE WAS A DWARF AND HAD SUCH A YELLOW FACE AND LIVED IN THE ORANGE TREE I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT FOR I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A WIFE ALL OVER THE WORLD NOW IF YOU WILL PROMISE THAT SHE SHALL MARRY ME
AND WHAT SHE WANTED WOULD APPEAR SO AFTER SHE HAD EATEN AND NIGHT WAS DRAWING NEAR SHE GREW SLEEPY AFTER HER JOURNEY AND THOUGHT SHE WOULD LIKE TO GO TO BED
AND WEST OF THE MOON AND THERE TOO IS A PRINCESS WITH A NOSE WHICH IS THREE ELLS LONG
HE GAVE HIMSELF UP TO DOING EVERY FOOLISH THING THAT OCCURRED TO HIM
FOR SHE DOES NOT KNOW THAT IT IS YOU WHO LET THEM FALL ON IT BUT NO ONE CAN WASH THEM OUT BUT ONE BORN OF CHRISTIAN FOLK IT CANNOT BE DONE BY ONE OF A PACK OF TROLLS
BEHIND THEM CAME A TALL OLD WOMAN WHOSE UGLINESS WAS EVEN MORE SURPRISING THAN HER EXTREME OLD AGE SHE WORE A RUFF OF BLACK TAFFETA A RED VELVET HOOD AND A FARTHINGALE ALL IN RAGS
SO SHE WAS NOT AFRAID OF HER PRISONER'S BEING ABLE TO ESCAPE
DO LEAVE ME IN PEACE MADAM I DON'T WANT TO CARE FOR ANYONE BUT YOU WOULD BE VERY HAPPY WITH ANY OF THESE PRINCES SAID THE QUEEN
AND AS HE SPOKE THE QUEEN SAW THE LIONS WHICH WERE RUNNING DOWN A HILL TOWARD THEM EACH ONE HAD TWO HEADS EIGHT FEET AND FOUR ROWS OF TEETH
AND THEN I WILL SAY THAT NO ONE SHALL EVER BE MY BRIDE BUT THE WOMAN WHO CAN DO THIS AND I KNOW THAT YOU
HER NAME WAS CELIA AND SHE WAS AS GOOD AS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL PRINCE DARLING FANCIED THAT CELIA WOULD THINK HERSELF ONLY TOO HAPPY IF HE OFFERED TO MAKE HER A GREAT QUEEN BUT SHE SAID FEARLESSLY SIRE I AM ONLY A SHEPHERDESS
ON HEARING THIS SHE WAS NEXT TO DISTRACTED WI GRIEF AND TERROR BUT SHE WAS LIFTED UP AND SET ON HIS BACK AND AWA THEY WENT AYE THEY TRAVELED AND ON THEY TRAVELED TILL THE LADY GREW FAINT
EVERY ONE OF THEM BUT UPON EACH IT HAD A DIFFERENT EFFECT ONE FELL ILL ONE WENT QUITE CRAZY
AND THE HEAP OF SALT GREW HIGHER AND HIGHER UNTIL AT LAST THE SHIP SANK THERE LIES THE MILL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AND STILL DAY BY DAY IT GRINDS ON
TILL THEY CAME IN SIGHT O THE FAR BIGGEST CASTLE AND FAR FARTHEST AFF THEY HAD YET SEEN WE MAUN BE YONDER THE NIGHT SAYS THE BULL
AND WHERE IT HAD BEEN STOOD A GREAT HOUSE THAT SEEMED TO BE BUILT OF GOLD AND PRECIOUS STONES NUMBERS OF PEOPLE SPLENDIDLY DRESSED WERE GOING INTO IT
NEXT MORNING SHE SAT DOWN BENEATH THE WALLS OF THE CASTLE TO PLAY WITH THE GOLDEN APPLE AND THE FIRST PERSON SHE SAW
AND SET FORTH ON THE JOURNEY TO HER BRIDEGROOM'S KINGDOM AFTER THEY HAD RIDDEN FOR ABOUT AN HOUR THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO FEEL VERY THIRSTY AND SAID TO HER WAITING MAID PRAY GET DOWN AND FETCH ME SOME WATER IN MY GOLDEN CUP OUT OF YONDER STREAM I WOULD LIKE A DRINK
WHEN SHE WISHED TO GET ON HER HORSE FALADA AGAIN THE WAITING MAID CALLED OUT I MEAN TO RIDE FALADA
WHICH I WANT TO HAVE WASHED OFF AND I HAVE VOWED TO MARRY NO ONE BUT THE WOMAN WHO IS ABLE TO DO IT IF SHE CANNOT DO THAT SHE IS NOT WORTH HAVING
AND WHERE TO FIND THE CASTLE WHICH LAY EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON BUT IT WAS ONLY THE SAME THING ONCE AGAIN
AND THE PRINCE FOUND HIMSELF CHANGED INTO A BEAUTIFUL WHITE DOVE HE REMEMBERED THAT WHITE WAS THE FAVORITE COLOR OF THE FAIRY TRUTH AND BEGAN TO HOPE THAT HE MIGHT AT LAST WIN BACK HER FAVOR BUT JUST NOW HIS FIRST CARE WAS FOR CELIA
AND IF EVERYTHING ROUND ABOUT YE TURNS BLUE I HAE BEATED THE DEIL BUT SHOULD A THINGS TURN RED HE'LL HAE CONQUERED ME SHE SET HERSEL DOWN ON THE STANE AND BY AND BY
BUT THAT HER DAUGHTER SEEMED SO UNWILLING TO MARRY AND SHE RECOMMENDED THEM TO GO AND TALK TO THE PRINCESS ABOUT IT THEMSELVES SO THIS THEY AT ONCE DID NOW BELLISSIMA WAS MUCH LESS PROUD SINCE HER ADVENTURE WITH THE YELLOW DWARF
SO THE OTHER TROLLS HAD TO COME AND WASH BUT THE MORE THEY DID THE BLACKER AND UGLIER GREW THE SHIRT UNTIL AT LENGTH IT WAS AS BLACK AS IF IT HAD BEEN UP THE CHIMNEY
THEREFORE IN YOUR NEW FORM TAKE THE APPEARANCE OF ALL THESE ANIMALS
BUT THE MORE SHE WASHED AND RUBBED THE LARGER THE SPOTS GREW
AND ONCE MORE DROVE HER AWAY WHEN DAY HAD QUITE COME THE GIRL SEATED HERSELF UNDER THE CASTLE WINDOWS TO SPIN WITH HER GOLDEN SPINNING WHEEL
AND HE SAW AT HIS FEET ONLY A PRETTY LITTLE DOG PRINCE DARLING
IF HE WANTED ANYTHING HE ONLY HAD TO CRY AND FRET AND STAMP HIS FEET AND SHE WOULD GIVE HIM WHATEVER HE ASKED FOR WHICH HAD MADE HIM SELF WILLED ALSO SHE HAD TOLD HIM FROM MORNING TO NIGHT THAT HE WOULD ONE DAY BE A KING AND THAT KINGS WERE VERY HAPPY
LOOK AT ME WELL PRINCESS BEFORE YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD SAID HE I DON'T WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME IN A HURRY OH CRIED SHE THE LIONS ARE COMING I HAVE LOOKED AT YOU ENOUGH I AM SO FRIGHTENED
I FLATTER MYSELF THAT YOU WILL NOT BE DISPLEASED AT HER CHOICE WHEN I TELL YOU
HO HO PRINCESS DO YOU THINK YOU ARE GOING TO BREAK WITH IMPUNITY THE PROMISE THAT YOU MADE TO MY FRIEND THE YELLOW DWARF I AM THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT
BUT SOON THOUGHT BETTER OF IT AND WISHED THAT HE WERE FREE I WOULD RETURN GOOD FOR EVIL HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND SAVE THE UNHAPPY MAN'S LIFE HE HAD HARDLY WISHED THIS WHEN HIS IRON CAGE FLEW OPEN AND HE RUSHED TO THE SIDE OF THE KEEPER WHO WAS AWAKE AND WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF AGAINST THE TIGER
BUT WHILE SHE WAS DOING IT SHE LET THREE DROPS OF HOT TALLOW FALL UPON HIS SHIRT AND HE AWOKE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOW
I PROMISED YOUR FATHER THAT I WOULD BE YOUR FRIEND AND TO KEEP MY WORD I HAVE COME TO BRING YOU A PRESENT AT THE SAME TIME SHE PUT A LITTLE GOLD RING UPON HIS FINGER TAKE GREAT CARE OF THIS RING SHE SAID IT IS MORE PRECIOUS THAN DIAMONDS EVERY TIME YOU DO A BAD DEED IT WILL PRICK YOUR FINGER
BUT SHE TOO HAD NOT HAD THE SHIRT VERY LONG IN HER HANDS BEFORE IT LOOKED WORSE STILL AND THE MORE SHE WASHED IT AND RUBBED IT THE LARGER AND BLACKER GREW THE SPOTS
AND SHE LOVED HIM SO MUCH THAT IT SEEMED TO HER THAT SHE MUST DIE IF SHE DID NOT KISS HIM THAT VERY MOMENT SO SHE DID KISS HIM
GET THERE I MUST SAID SHE
EVERYTHING HAPPENED JUST AS THE OLD MAN HAD SAID IT WOULD ALL THE PEOPLE GREAT AND SMALL CAME ROUND HIM LIKE ANTS ON AN ANT HILL AND EACH TRIED TO OUTBID THE OTHER FOR THE HAM BY RIGHTS
AT LAST HE SAID WELL IF YOU WON'T TELL ME CONFIDE YOUR TROUBLE TO THE IRON STOVE THERE AND HE WENT AWAY THEN SHE CREPT TO THE STOVE AND BEGAN TO SOB AND CRY AND TO POUR OUT HER POOR LITTLE HEART AND SAID HERE I SIT DESERTED BY ALL THE WORLD
WITH THESE THISTLES AND NETTLES SHE CAN FEED A DONKEY WHICH SHE CAN RIDE WHENEVER SHE LIKES UNDER THIS HUMBLE ROOF NO WEATHER CAN HURT HER SHE WILL DRINK THE WATER OF THIS BROOK AND EAT FROGS WHICH GROW VERY FAT ABOUT HERE
FOR ALL DAY LONG SHE HAD TO GO ABOUT ALONE AND SHE DID SO WISH TO GO HOME TO HER FATHER AND MOTHER AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS THEN THE WHITE BEAR ASKED WHAT IT WAS THAT SHE WANTED AND SHE TOLD HIM
IF YOU WANT A DRINK YOU CAN DISMOUNT AND GET IT I DON'T MEAN TO BE YOUR SERVANT THEN THE PRINCESS WAS COMPELLED BY HER THIRST TO GET DOWN AND BENDING OVER THE FLOWING WATER SHE CRIED AND SAID OH HEAVEN WHAT AM I TO DO
AND HAD LEFT THUS STANDING IN THE COURT BELOW OH REPLIED THE BRIDE I BROUGHT HER WITH ME TO KEEP ME COMPANY ON THE JOURNEY
GREW UP SO PROUD AND SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER OWN BEAUTY THAT SHE DESPISED EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD THE QUEEN HER MOTHER BY HER CARESSES AND FLATTERIES HELPED TO MAKE HER BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO GOOD FOR HER
TRIFLING FAULT BUT WHEN HE WAS REALLY NAUGHTY IT MADE HIS FINGER ACTUALLY BLEED AT LAST HE GOT TIRED OF BEING CONSTANTLY REMINDED AND WANTED TO BE ABLE TO DO AS HE LIKED SO HE THREW HIS RING ASIDE
AND THEN UP THE TREE AND THERE SHE SAW A LITTLE TINY MAN WHO WAS EATING ORANGES OH QUEEN SAID HE I KNOW YOU VERY WELL AND I KNOW HOW MUCH AFRAID YOU ARE OF THE LIONS
WHICH SHONE WITH GOLD AND SILVER LIKEWISE A LARGE HALL IN WHICH THERE WAS A WELL SPREAD TABLE AND IT WAS SO MAGNIFICENT
WELL IF I MAY GO TO THE PRINCE WHO IS HERE AND BE WITH HIM TO NIGHT YOU SHALL HAVE IT
NO MY PRINCE REPLIED CELIA I CANNOT HELP THINKING YOU VERY HANDSOME BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD RICHES BE TO ME AND ALL THE GRAND DRESSES AND SPLENDID CARRIAGES THAT YOU WOULD GIVE ME
BUT JUST AS THEY PASSED SHE LOOKED UP AND SAW THE KING AND THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT NOW THE FAIRY WAS SO CLEVER THAT SHE COULD NOT ONLY SEEM BEAUTIFUL TO THE KING BUT EVEN THE POOR PRINCESS THOUGHT HER THE MOST LOVELY BEING SHE HAD EVER SEEN
FROM BEHIND THE DOOR SAID HE WHO OWNED THE MILL FOR HE DID NOT CHOOSE TO SATISFY HIS BROTHER ON THAT POINT BUT LATER IN THE EVENING WHEN HE HAD TAKEN A DROP TOO MUCH HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM TELLING HOW HE HAD COME BY THE HAND MILL
AND AWAY THEY WENT HIGH UP THROUGH THE AIR AS IF THEY WOULD NOT STOP UNTIL THEY HAD REACHED THE VERY END OF THE WORLD
THIS EVIL ADVISER SAID TO HIM YOU ARE VERY KIND TO TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT THIS LITTLE GIRL IF I WERE YOU I WOULD SOON MAKE HER OBEY ME REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE A KING AND THAT IT WOULD BE LAUGHABLE TO SEE YOU TRYING TO PLEASE A SHEPHERDESS WHO OUGHT TO BE ONLY TOO GLAD TO BE ONE OF YOUR SLAVES
BUT HE HAD TO GIVE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT AND THE POOR BROTHER WAS TO KEEP IT TILL THE HAYMAKING WAS OVER FOR HE THOUGHT IF I KEEP IT AS LONG AS THAT I CAN MAKE IT GRIND MEAT AND DRINK THAT WILL LAST MANY A LONG YEAR
BUT THAT EVENING WHEN THEY GOT HOME CURDKEN WENT TO THE OLD KING AND SAID I REFUSE TO HERD GEESE ANY LONGER WITH THAT GIRL FOR WHAT REASON ASKED THE OLD KING BECAUSE SHE DOES NOTHING BUT ANNOY ME ALL DAY LONG REPLIED CURDKEN
BUT IF SHE COULD GET LEAVE TO GO TO THE PRINCE WHO LIVED THERE AND BE WITH HIM DURING THE NIGHT
AND THERE WAS JUST ENOUGH STRENGTH LEFT IN THE NORTH WIND TO ENABLE HIM TO THROW HER ON TO THE SHORE IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE WINDOWS OF A CASTLE WHICH LAY EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST OF THE MOON
AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY AND DANGER THAT THE MAN COULD GO THROUGH THE STREAM OF POTTAGE AND GET HOLD OF THE DOOR LATCH WHEN HE GOT THE DOOR OPEN HE DID NOT STAY LONG IN THE ROOM BUT RAN OUT AND THE HERRINGS AND POTTAGE CAME AFTER HIM
AND NEARER WHAT SHALL I DO SHE CRIED MUST ALL MY HAPPY DAYS COME TO AN END LIKE THIS THE MALICIOUS DWARF LOOKED AT HER AND BEGAN TO LAUGH SPITEFULLY AT LEAST SAID HE
TO SEEK OUT EVERYTHING RARE AND PRECIOUS TO ADORN THE PRINCESS ALTHOUGH HER BEAUTY WAS SO PERFECT THAT NOTHING SHE WORE COULD MAKE HER LOOK PRETTIER AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES THOUGHT AND HE WAS NEVER HAPPY UNLESS HE WAS WITH HER
THEN A PUFF OF WIND CAME AND BLEW CURDKEN'S HAT FAR AWAY SO THAT HE HAD TO RUN AFTER IT AND WHEN HE RETURNED SHE HAD LONG FINISHED PUTTING UP HER GOLDEN LOCKS AND HE COULDN'T GET ANY HAIR SO THEY WATCHED THE GEESE TILL IT WAS DARK
THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT HAD ALSO SEEN BELLISSIMA AND SHE TRIED TO READ IN THE KING'S EYES THE EFFECT THAT THIS UNEXPECTED SIGHT HAD HAD UPON HIM NO ONE CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU WISH TO KNOW BETTER THAN I CAN SAID HE
WHEN THE PRINCE GREW OLD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND HE SOON LEARNED THAT THERE COULD BE NOTHING WORSE THAN TO BE PROUD OBSTINATE AND CONCEITED AND HE HAD REALLY TRIED TO CURE HIMSELF OF THESE DEFECTS BUT BY THAT TIME ALL HIS FAULTS HAD BECOME HABITS
CELIA AND PRINCE DARLING THREW THEMSELVES AT THE FAIRY'S FEET
AND CURDKEN WENT ON TO TELL WHAT PASSED ON THE COMMON WHERE THE GEESE FED AND HOW HE HAD ALWAYS TO CHASE HIS HAT THE OLD KING BADE HIM GO AND DRIVE FORTH HIS FLOCK AS USUAL NEXT DAY AND WHEN MORNING CAME
WHICH WERE GIVEN AWAY TO EVERYONE WHO LIKED TO HOLD OUT HIS HAND WHICH NUMBERS OF PEOPLE HASTENED TO DO YOU MAY BE SURE INDEED SOME FOUND THIS BY FAR THE MOST AMUSING PART OF THE WEDDING FESTIVITIES
LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL AT LAST HE WENT SO LOW
THEY WERE AT THE PLACE THEY LIFTED HER AFF HIS BACK AND TOOK HER IN AND SENT HIM AWAY TO A PARK FOR THE NIGHT IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY BROUGHT THE BULL HAME
AND THIS MADE PRINCE DARLING SO CROSS THAT HE GAVE HER QUITE A HARD KICK INSTANTLY HIS RING PRICKED HIM SHARPLY
THEY WOULD NOT BE SUCH A TROUBLE TO ME NOW HIS RING PRICKED HIM VERY OFTEN AND SOMETIMES HE LEFT OFF WHAT HE WAS DOING AT ONCE
SHE RANG THE BELL AND SCARCELY HAD SHE TOUCHED IT BEFORE SHE FOUND HERSELF IN A CHAMBER WHERE A BED STOOD READY MADE FOR HER WHICH WAS AS PRETTY AS ANYONE COULD WISH TO SLEEP IN
PERHAPS HE MAY KNOW WHERE THE CASTLE IS AND WILL BLOW YOU THITHER BUT WHEN YOU HAVE GOT TO HIM YOU MUST JUST STRIKE THE HORSE BENEATH THE LEFT EAR AND HE WILL COME HOME AGAIN AND THEN SHE GAVE HER THE GOLDEN SPINNING WHEEL
AND SAW IT COVERED WITH FLOWERS AND FRUIT SHE STOPPED AND BEGAN TO GATHER SOME OF THE ORANGES AND THEN PUTTING DOWN HER BASKET SHE SAT DOWN TO EAT THEM BUT WHEN IT WAS TIME TO GO ON AGAIN THE BASKET HAD DISAPPEARED AND THOUGH SHE LOOKED EVERYWHERE
BIDDING HER NO TO BREAK IT TILL SHE WAS IN THE GREATEST STRAIT EVER MORTAL COULD BE IN AND THAT WAD GET HER OUT O'T AGAIN SHE WAS LIFTED AND SET ON HIS BACK AND AWA THEY WENT
WHEN DINNER TIME DREW NEAR HE SET THE MILL ON THE KITCHEN TABLE AND SAID GRIND HERRINGS AND MILK POTTAGE AND DO IT BOTH QUICKLY AND WELL SO THE MILL BEGAN TO GRIND HERRINGS AND MILK POTTAGE
IT WAS BY NO MEANS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE BROTHER HAD BEEN FORCED TO GIVE SOMETHING TO HIM AND HE WAS NOT BETTER PLEASED AT BEING ASKED NOW THAN HE GENERALLY WAS IF YOU WILL DO WHAT I ASK YOU
AND THE MAN TAKING HIM UP IN HIS ARMS CARRIED HIM TO THE KING
HIS BAD FRIENDS WHEN THEY HEARD HIM RESOLVED TO TURN HIS WRATH UPON AN OLD NOBLEMAN WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN HIS TUTOR AND WHO STILL DARED SOMETIMES TO TELL THE PRINCE OF HIS FAULTS FOR HE LOVED HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN HIS OWN SON AT FIRST PRINCE DARLING HAD THANKED HIM
FOR SHE LOVED HER DAUGHTER VERY DEARLY SHE GAVE HER A WAITING MAID ALSO WHO WAS TO RIDE WITH HER AND HAND HER OVER TO THE BRIDEGROOM AND SHE PROVIDED EACH OF THEM WITH A HORSE FOR THE JOURNEY NOW THE PRINCESS'S HORSE WAS CALLED FALADA AND COULD SPEAK
AND WHENEVER SHE BEGAN THE STAINS CAME OUT PURE AND CLEAN BUT THE AULD WIFE MADE THE KNIGHT BELIEVE IT WAS HER DOCHTER HAD WASHED THE SARKS SO THE KNIGHT AND THE ELDEST DOCHTER WERE TO BE MARRIED
SO THAT EVENING WHEN THE PRINCESS CAME ONCE MORE WITH HER SLEEPING DRINK
I SHALL BE EATEN UP AND BEING TOO FRIGHTENED TO RUN A SINGLE STEP SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND LEANED AGAINST THE TREE UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ASLEEP
WAS FEELING TERRIBLY SAD AT BEING SO RAPIDLY TORN AWAY FROM HIS BELOVED PRINCESS BUT HE KNEW TOO WELL HOW POWERFUL THE FAIRY WAS TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING FROM HER EXCEPT BY GREAT PATIENCE AND CUNNING
NOT ONE OF THE LIONS TIGERS OR BEARS SHALL TOUCH YOU THE QUEEN LOOKED AT HIM AND WAS ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF HIS UGLY LITTLE FACE AS SHE HAD BEEN OF THE LIONS BEFORE SO THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD
THE PRINCESS ASKED HER WHAT SHE WANTED FOR IT AND SHE REPLIED THAT IT WAS NOT FOR SALE EITHER FOR GOLD OR MONEY BUT THAT IF SHE COULD GET LEAVE TO GO TO THE PRINCE AND BE WITH HIM DURING THE NIGHT SHE SHOULD HAVE IT
THIS CHANCE MEETING WITH AN UNHAPPY PRINCESS FOR WHOM I ONCE HAD A PASSING FANCY BEFORE I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MEET YOU HAS AFFECTED ME A LITTLE I ADMIT BUT YOU ARE SO MUCH MORE TO ME THAN SHE IS THAT I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN LEAVE YOU
A LONG TIME WENT BY AND THEN YET MORE TIME PASSED AND STILL THEY WERE ABOVE THE SEA AND THE NORTH WIND GREW TIRED
AND ASKED WHAT SHE WOULD TAKE FOR IT THE GIRL SAID WHAT SHE HAD SAID ON EACH OF THE FORMER OCCASIONS THAT IT WAS NOT FOR SALE EITHER FOR GOLD OR FOR MONEY
AND THEY PERSUADED HIM TO DRINK A GREAT DEAL OF WINE AND CONTINUED TO EXCITE HIS ANGER AGAINST CELIA BY TELLING HIM THAT SHE HAD LAUGHED AT HIS LOVE FOR HER UNTIL AT LAST IN QUITE A FURIOUS RAGE HE RUSHED OFF TO FIND HER DECLARING THAT IF SHE STILL REFUSED TO MARRY HIM
THE WHITE BEAR CAME TO FETCH HER SHE SEATED HERSELF ON HIS BACK WITH HER BUNDLE AND THUS THEY DEPARTED WHEN THEY HAD GONE A GREAT PART OF THE WAY THE WHITE BEAR SAID ARE YOU AFRAID
PREPARATIONS WERE BEGUN AT ONCE FOR THE GRANDEST WEDDING THAT HAD EVER BEEN HELD AT THE PALACE THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES SENT SUCH IMMENSE SUMS OF MONEY
LIT HER CANDLE LET HER LIGHT SHINE ON HIM AND SAW HIM AND HE WAS THE HANDSOMEST PRINCE THAT EYES HAD EVER BEHELD
WHAT SHE CRIED WAS I NOT UNHAPPY ENOUGH IN THIS LONELY CASTLE TO WHICH THAT FRIGHTFUL YELLOW DWARF BROUGHT ME MUST I ALSO BE MADE TO KNOW THAT THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES CEASED TO LOVE ME
AND TOOK AWAY WITH THEM ALL THE GOLD AND SILVER THAT THEY COULD CARRY AND MOVED FAR AWAY FROM THE CASTLE WHICH LAY EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST
DRAWING A GREAT KNIFE WITH WHICH HE WAS ARMED CHALLENGED THE KING TO MEET HIM IN SINGLE COMBAT AND RUSHED DOWN INTO THE COURTYARD OF THE PALACE WITH A TERRIBLE CLATTER THE KING QUITE PROVOKED FOLLOWED HIM HASTILY
WE MAY AS WELL GO IT MAY BE THAT HE FINDS HE IS NOT GOOD AT MAKING POTTAGE AND I SHOULD DO WELL TO HELP HIM SO THEY BEGAN TO STRAGGLE HOMEWARD BUT WHEN THEY HAD GOT A LITTLE WAY UP THE HILL
STIRRED BY WILD WINDS FROM DEPTH TO HEIGHT THOU HOLD'ST MY LOVED ONE FAR FROM ME AND I AM CAPTIVE TO THY MIGHT MY HEART IS STILL MORE WILD THAN THINE
THROWING OFF THE HERMIT'S ROBE IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN DISGUISED AND APPEARING BEFORE THEM CELIA HAS LOVED YOU EVER SINCE SHE FIRST SAW YOU ONLY SHE WOULD NOT TELL YOU WHILE YOU WERE SO OBSTINATE AND NAUGHTY
FROM THE WINDOWS BUT WHAT SEEMED VERY STRANGE WAS THAT THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE WERE PALE AND THIN AND THEIR CLOTHES WERE TORN AND HANGING IN RAGS ABOUT THEM SOME FELL DOWN DEAD AS THEY CAME OUT BEFORE THEY HAD TIME TO GET AWAY OTHERS CRAWLED FARTHER WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY
OF A GALLANT YOUNG KNIGHT THAT HAD GIVEN IN SOME BLUIDY SARKS TO WASH AND WHAEVER WASHED THAE SARKS WAS TO BE HIS WIFE THE AULD WIFE HAD WASHED TILL SHE WAS TIRED AND THEN SHE SET TO HER DOCHTER
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT IS A GOOD ONE AND THE WATER THAT TURNS IT WILL NEVER FREEZE SAID THE MAN SO HE GROUND MEAT AND DRINK AND ALL KINDS OF GOOD THINGS TO LAST ALL CHRISTMAS TIDE
FOR ALL ROUND THE GREAT BANQUETING HALL HAD BEEN ARRANGED A THOUSAND BARRELS FULL OF GOLD AND NUMBERLESS BAGS MADE OF VELVET EMBROIDERED WITH PEARLS AND FILLED WITH MONEY EACH ONE CONTAINING AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND GOLD PIECES
WITHOUT THE YELLOW DWARF AND HIS ORANGE TREE
THE BLACK BULL OF NORROWAY AND MANY A HUNTING SONG THEY SUNG AND SONG OF GAME AND GLEE THEN TUNED TO PLAINTIVE STRAINS THEIR TONGUE
BUT THE QUEEN WHO DIDN'T WANT HER TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH ONLY SAID THAT SHE WAS ILL OR THAT ONE OF HER NEIGHBORS WAS THREATENING TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HER BELLISSIMA KNEW QUITE WELL THAT SOMETHING WAS BEING HIDDEN FROM HER
BUT THAT YOU MUST BY NO MEANS DO OR YOU WILL BRING GREAT MISERY ON BOTH OF US SO ONE SUNDAY THE WHITE BEAR CAME AND SAID THAT THEY COULD NOW SET OUT TO SEE HER FATHER AND MOTHER
SHE FOUND TO HER GREAT SURPRISE THAT SHE WAS LYING IN HER OWN BED AT HOME AND WHAT WAS MORE THAT SHE HAD ON THE LOVELIEST LACE NIGHT CAP THAT SHE HAD EVER SEEN IN HER LIFE AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT THAT ALL HER ADVENTURES
HE SAW HIS BELOVED PRINCESS IN A CASTLE BUILT OF POLISHED STEEL THE WALLS OF WHICH REFLECTED THE SUN'S RAYS SO HOTLY THAT NO ONE COULD APPROACH IT WITHOUT BEING BURNT TO A CINDER
I WHO AM A KING'S DAUGHTER AND A FALSE WAITING MAID HAS FORCED ME TO TAKE OFF MY OWN CLOTHES AND HAS TAKEN MY PLACE WITH MY BRIDEGROOM WHILE I HAVE TO FULFILL THE LOWLY OFFICE OF GOOSE GIRL IF MY MOTHER ONLY KNEW HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO
FOR HE KNEW HIS DOOR HAD BEEN TIGHTLY SHUT AND HE COULD NOT THINK HOW SHE HAD GOT IN BUT SHE SAID TO HIM I AM THE FAIRY TRUTH I WAS PASSING THROUGH THE WOOD WHEN YOU WERE OUT HUNTING
UNTIL AT LAST SHE CAME TO A GREAT MOUNTAIN OUTSIDE IT AN AGED WOMAN WAS SITTING PLAYING WITH A GOLDEN APPLE
THAT IT WAS SO DULL THERE IN THE MOUNTAIN AND THAT SHE HAD TO GO ABOUT ALL ALONE AND THAT IN HER PARENTS HOUSE AT HOME THERE WERE ALL HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND IT WAS BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT GO TO THEM THAT SHE WAS SO SORROWFUL
BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
BUT I REALLY CANNOT ENDURE THE WAY IN WHICH SHE PROTECTS THE YELLOW DWARF AND KEEPS ME CHAINED HERE LIKE A CRIMINAL IT IS TRUE THAT I LOVE A CHARMING PRINCESS BUT IF THE FAIRY SHOULD SET ME FREE MY GRATITUDE WOULD OBLIGE ME TO LOVE HER ONLY
HOW SHE GOT THERE SHE COULD NOT TELL BUT SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LACE AND RIBBONS AND ON HER FINGER WAS A LITTLE RING MADE OF A SINGLE RED HAIR
AND WILT THOU NO WAUKEN AND TURN TO ME NEXT DAY SHE KENTNA WHAT TO DO FOR GRIEF SHE THEN BRAK THE PEAR AND FOUND IT FILLED WI JEWELRY FAR RICHER THAN THE CONTENTS O THE APPLE
THAT FAITHLESS PRINCESS WHO WOULD HAVE MARRIED YOU IS PROMISED TO ME SEE IF SHE HAS NOT UPON HER FINGER A RING MADE OF ONE OF MY HAIRS JUST TRY TO TAKE IT OFF
AND IT STREAMED OUT OVER BOTH FARM AND FIELD NOW THE OLD WOMAN WHO WAS OUT SPREADING THE HAY BEGAN TO THINK DINNER WAS LONG IN COMING AND SAID TO THE WOMEN AND THE MOWERS THOUGH THE MASTER DOES NOT CALL US HOME
AS SHE AND CURDKEN WERE DRIVING THEIR FLOCK THROUGH THE GATE SHE SAID AS SHE PASSED UNDER OH FALADA TIS YOU HANG THERE AND THE HEAD REPLIED TIS YOU PASS UNDER PRINCESS FAIR IF YOUR MOTHER ONLY KNEW HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO
AND YOU ALONE CAN SAVE ME I WILL SAY THAT I WANT TO SEE WHAT MY BRIDE CAN DO AND BID HER WASH THE SHIRT
AND SEEING UPON A TABLE A GRANDER COAT THAN HIS OWN HE PUT IT ON CAREFULLY THE FAIRY CAME BACK SO DELIGHTED THAT SHE COULD NOT CONCEAL HER JOY I AM QUITE AWARE OF THE TROUBLE YOU HAVE TAKEN TO PLEASE ME SAID SHE
ALL THE KING'S UNSUCCESSFUL RIVALS HAD GONE HOME IN DESPAIR THEY SAID GOOD BY TO THE PRINCESS SO SADLY THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING SORRY FOR THEM AH MADAM THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES SAID TO HER
AND THE PEOPLE WERE FORCED TO GIVE HIM THE HAND MILL WHEN THE MAN CAME OUT AGAIN INTO THE YARD HE ASKED THE OLD WOOD CUTTER HOW HE WAS TO STOP THE HAND MILL AND WHEN HE HAD LEARNED THAT HE THANKED HIM AND SET OFF HOME WITH ALL THE SPEED HE COULD
DURING THAT TIME YOU MAY IMAGINE THAT THE MILL DID NOT GROW RUSTY AND WHEN HAY HARVEST CAME THE RICH BROTHER GOT IT BUT THE OTHER HAD TAKEN GOOD CARE NOT TO TEACH HIM HOW TO STOP IT
THEN CURDKEN RAN UP TO HER AND WANTED TO GRASP SOME OF THE HAIR FROM HER HEAD BUT SHE CALLED OUT HASTILY WIND WIND GENTLY SWAY BLOW CURDKEN'S HAT AWAY LET HIM CHASE O'ER FIELD AND WOLD TILL MY LOCKS OF RUDDY GOLD NOW ASTRAY AND HANGING DOWN BE COMBED AND PLAITED IN A CROWN
BUT SAID PRINCE DARLING WOULD IT NOT BE A SHAME IF I HAD AN INNOCENT GIRL PUT TO DEATH FOR CELIA HAS DONE NOTHING TO DESERVE PUNISHMENT IF PEOPLE WILL NOT DO AS YOU TELL THEM THEY OUGHT TO SUFFER FOR IT ANSWERED HIS FOSTER BROTHER BUT EVEN IF IT WERE UNJUST
BUT IF I SELL IT I WILL HAVE THE HAND MILL WHICH IS STANDING THERE BEHIND THE DOOR AT FIRST THEY WOULD NOT HEAR OF THIS AND HAGGLED AND BARGAINED WITH THE MAN BUT HE STUCK TO WHAT HE HAD SAID
FIVE OR SIX TIMES A DAY JUST TO PLEASE HER
THE GOOD KING WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THIS PROMISE AND VERY SOON AFTERWARD HE DIED PRINCE DARLING WAS VERY SORRY
WITH ALL MY HEART ANSWERED THE FAIRY I CAN MAKE YOUR SON THE HANDSOMEST PRINCE IN THE WORLD OR THE RICHEST OR THE MOST POWERFUL CHOOSE WHICHEVER YOU LIKE FOR HIM I DO NOT ASK EITHER OF THESE THINGS FOR MY SON REPLIED THE GOOD KING BUT IF YOU WILL MAKE HIM THE BEST OF PRINCES
AND FIRST ALL THE DISHES AND TUBS WERE FILLED AND THEN IT CAME OUT ALL OVER THE KITCHEN FLOOR THE MAN TWISTED AND TURNED IT AND DID ALL HE COULD TO MAKE THE MILL STOP BUT HOWSOEVER HE TURNED IT AND SCREWED IT THE MILL WENT ON GRINDING
AND THEY JOURNEYED THITHER SHE SITTING ON HIS BACK AND THEY WENT A LONG LONG WAY AND IT TOOK A LONG LONG TIME BUT AT LAST THEY CAME TO A LARGE WHITE FARMHOUSE
AND GANG AND LOOK OUT O HER BACK DOOR AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD SEE SHE SAW NOCHT THE FIRST DAY THE SECOND DAY SHE DID THE SAME AND SAW NOCHT ON THE THIRD DAY SHE LOOKED AGAIN AND SAW A COACH AND SIX
AND HE PROCEEDED TO RELATE THE WHOLE STORY
HER MOTHER WANTED TO TALK WITH HER ALONE IN HER OWN CHAMBER BUT SHE REMEMBERED WHAT THE WHITE BEAR HAD SAID AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT GO WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY CAN BE SAID AT ANY TIME
AND HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE RUNNING ABOUT OUTSIDE IT PLAYING AND IT WAS SO PRETTY THAT IT WAS A PLEASURE TO LOOK AT IT
HER MOTHER WHO SINCE THE DEATH OF THE KING HER FATHER HAD NOTHING IN THE WORLD SHE CARED FOR SO MUCH AS THIS LITTLE PRINCESS WAS SO TERRIBLY AFRAID OF LOSING HER THAT SHE QUITE SPOILED HER
BLESS ME SAID THE OLD WOMAN AS ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER APPEARED AND SHE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE HER HUSBAND HAD GOT THE MILL FROM BUT HE WOULD NOT TELL HER THAT NEVER MIND WHERE I GOT IT
YOU HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF DYING UNMARRIED A LOVELY PRINCESS LIKE YOU MUST SURELY PREFER TO DIE RATHER THAN BE THE WIFE OF A POOR LITTLE DWARF LIKE MYSELF OH DON'T BE ANGRY WITH ME CRIED THE PRINCESS CLASPING HER HANDS
AND THE THREE DROPS OF BLOOD REPLIED IF YOUR MOTHER ONLY KNEW HER HEART WOULD SURELY BREAK IN TWO AND AS SHE DRANK THUS AND LEANED RIGHT OVER THE WATER THE RAG CONTAINING THE THREE DROPS OF BLOOD FELL FROM HER BOSOM AND FLOATED DOWN THE STREAM
AND DROVE HER OUT AGAIN IN THE DAYTIME SHE SAT DOWN ONCE MORE BENEATH THE WINDOWS OF THE CASTLE AND BEGAN TO CARD WITH HER GOLDEN CARDING COMB
FOR THE PRINCESS HAD SO CONTRIVED IT THE POOR GIRL CALLED TO HIM AND SHOOK HIM AND BETWEEN WHILES SHE WEPT BUT SHE COULD NOT WAKE HIM IN THE MORNING AS SOON AS DAY DAWNED
AND MAKE A GREATER TRIUMPH HIS THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR THEM SING OF HER TRIUMPHS SHE LED THE KING INTO THE MOST SPLENDID ROOM THAT CAN BE IMAGINED AND LEFT HIM ALONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE
TILL THEY CAME TO A DARK AND UGSOME GLEN WHERE THEY STOPPED AND THE LADY LIGHTED DOWN SAYS THE BULL TO HER HERE YE MAUN STAY TILL I GANG AND FIGHT THE DEIL
AND SHE HAD TO TELL HIM HOW SHE HAD COME THERE YOU HAVE COME JUST IN TIME SAID THE PRINCE FOR I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MARRIED TO MORROW BUT I WILL NOT HAVE THE LONG NOSED PRINCESS
THE PRINCE WAS VERY ANGRY AT THIS SPEECH AND COMMANDED HIS OFFICERS TO MAKE CELIA A PRISONER AND CARRY HER OFF TO HIS PALACE ALL DAY LONG THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID ANNOYED HIM BUT AS HE LOVED HER HE COULD NOT MAKE UP HIS MIND TO HAVE HER PUNISHED
CELIA WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR HOW SORRY HE WAS FOR ALL HIS PAST FOLLIES AND MISDEEDS AND PROMISED TO LOVE HIM AS LONG AS SHE LIVED RISE MY CHILDREN SAID THE FAIRY AND I WILL TRANSPORT YOU TO THE PALACE AND PRINCE DARLING
AND HE RESOLVED TO KEEP WAKING THAT NIGHT TO TRY WHAT HE COULD HEAR THAT BEING THE THIRD NIGHT AND THE DAMOSEL BEING BETWEEN HOPE AND DESPAIR SHE BRAK HER PLUM
WILL YOU GIVE ME YOUR YOUNGEST DAUGHTER SAID THE WHITE BEAR IF YOU WILL YOU SHALL BE AS RICH AS YOU ARE NOW POOR TRULY THE MAN WOULD HAVE HAD NO OBJECTION TO BE RICH
AS SOON AS HE LOST SIGHT OF ME BUT WHO CAN MY RIVAL BE WHOSE FATAL BEAUTY IS GREATER THAN MINE WHILE SHE WAS SAYING THIS THE KING WHO REALLY LOVED HER AS MUCH AS EVER
AND WHEN THEY HAD REACHED THE COMMON WHERE THE GEESE FED SHE SAT DOWN AND UNLOOSED HER HAIR WHICH WAS OF PURE GOLD CURDKEN LOVED TO SEE IT GLITTER IN THE SUN AND WANTED MUCH TO PULL SOME HAIR OUT THEN SHE SPOKE WIND WIND GENTLY SWAY
SO SHE CAME IN CAN YOU WASH THIS SHIRT CLEAN HE CRIED OH I DON'T KNOW SHE SAID BUT I WILL TRY
HE ASKED IF IT COULD MAKE SALT YES IT COULD MAKE SALT SAID HE WHO OWNED IT AND WHEN THE SKIPPER HEARD THAT HE WISHED WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND MAIN TO HAVE THE MILL LET IT COST WHAT IT MIGHT
AND AS HE HAD NO HAIR AND VERY LONG EARS HE LOOKED ALTOGETHER A SHOCKING LITTLE OBJECT I AM DELIGHTED
WI HUNGER EAT OUT O MY RIGHT LUG SAYS THE BLACK BULL AND DRINK OUT O MY LEFT LUG AND SET BY YOUR LEAVINGS SAE SHE DID AS HE SAID AND WAS WONDERFULLY REFRESHED
MAY I BURN MY CRUTCH AH PRINCESS SAID THE QUEEN WEEPING WHAT IS THIS THAT I HEAR WHAT HAVE YOU PROMISED AH MY MOTHER REPLIED BELLISSIMA SADLY
THE BRIDEGROOM SAT AT THE HEAD OF THE TABLE THE PRINCESS ON ONE SIDE OF HIM
NOW WHEN THE TIME DREW NEAR FOR HER TO BE MARRIED AND TO DEPART INTO A FOREIGN KINGDOM HER OLD MOTHER GAVE HER MUCH COSTLY BAGGAGE AND MANY ORNAMENTS GOLD AND SILVER
BUT THEY HAD HARDLY TAKEN THEIR PLACES FACING ONE ANOTHER AND THE WHOLE COURT HAD ONLY JUST HAD TIME TO RUSH OUT UPON THE BALCONIES TO WATCH WHAT WAS GOING ON
AND ON COMING BACK SAID TO THE AULD WIFE SHE SAW NOCHT BUT A MUCKLE BLACK BULL COMING ROARING ALANG THE ROAD
THAT SHE BURST
PRAY GET DOWN AND GIVE ME A DRINK FROM MY GOLDEN CUP FOR SHE HAD LONG AGO FORGOTTEN HER MAID'S RUDE WORDS
YOU HAD BETTER BE ACCUSED OF THAT BY YOUR SUBJECTS
TOUCHED WITH COMPASSION HE SAID TO HIMSELF I AM VERY HUNGRY BUT I SHALL NOT DIE OF STARVATION BEFORE I GET MY DINNER IF I GIVE MY BREAKFAST TO THIS POOR CREATURE PERHAPS I MAY SAVE HER LIFE SO HE LAID HIS PIECE OF BREAD IN THE GIRL'S HAND AND SAW HER EAT IT UP
HE WAS LED AWAY BY FLATTERERS I KNEW HIS HEART AND AM CERTAIN THAT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE BAD INFLUENCE OF THOSE WHO SURROUNDED HIM HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD KING AND A FATHER TO HIS PEOPLE WE MAY HATE HIS FAULTS
DEAR CHILD TAKE GREAT CARE OF THIS RAG IT MAY BE OF USE TO YOU ON THE JOURNEY SO THEY TOOK A SAD FAREWELL OF EACH OTHER AND THE PRINCESS STUCK THE RAG IN FRONT OF HER DRESS MOUNTED HER HORSE
UNLESS HE WILL HELP ME HE MUST HIMSELF TRY HARD TO BECOME GOOD I CAN ONLY PROMISE TO GIVE HIM GOOD ADVICE TO SCOLD HIM FOR HIS FAULTS
FOR I'M GAUN AWA TO SEEK MY FORTUNE HER MITHER DID SAE AND THE DOCHTER GAED AWA TO AN AULD WITCH WASHERWIFE AND TELLED HER PURPOSE THE AULD WIFE BADE HER STAY THAT DAY
HE COULD DO NOTHING FOR HER THAT WOULD SHELTER HER FROM DISCOVERY AND SCORN AMONG THE RELATIVES AND NEIGHBOURS WHO ONCE MORE MADE ALL HER WORLD NOW HER AIRY DREAM HAD VANISHED HER IMAGINATION NO LONGER SAW HAPPINESS WITH ARTHUR FOR HE COULD DO NOTHING THAT WOULD SATISFY OR SOOTHE HER PRIDE
ADAM WAS LOOKING AT HETTY AND SAW THE FROWN AND POUT AND THE DARK EYES SEEMING TO GROW LARGER WITH PETTISH HALF GATHERED TEARS QUIET MARY BURGE WHO SAT NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE THAT HETTY WAS CROSS AND THAT ADAM'S EYES WERE FIXED ON HER
I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU'D LET A BIT O REPAIRS BE DONE TO EM FOR THE BOARDING'S THAT STATE AS WE'RE LIKE TO BE EATEN UP WI RATS AND MICE AND THE CELLAR YOU MAY STAN UP TO YOUR KNEES WATER IN'T IF YOU LIKE TO GO DOWN BUT PERHAPS YOU'D RATHER BELIEVE MY WORDS
AND WISELY FELL BACK ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH FAR FROM BEING EXHAUSTED IN A SINGLE EVENING WAS RENEWED IN THE CHURCHYARD BEFORE SERVICE THE NEXT DAY WITH THE FRESH INTEREST CONFERRED ON ALL NEWS WHEN THERE IS A FRESH PERSON TO HEAR IT
THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO SNOWFIELD ON HORSEBACK THIS TIME FOR HIS HOURS WERE PRECIOUS NOW AND HE HAD BORROWED JONATHAN BURGE'S GOOD NAG FOR THE JOURNEY WHAT KEEN MEMORIES WENT ALONG THE ROAD WITH HIM
SHOULD SIT AT TOP O THE TABLE I WASN'T BUTLER FIFTEEN YEAR WITHOUT LEARNING THE RIGHTS AND THE WRONGS ABOUT DINNER NAY NAY SAID OLD MARTIN I'N GI'EN UP TO MY SON
HOW COULD SHE BUT HAVE THOUGHT THAT HER WHOLE LOT WAS GOING TO CHANGE AND THAT TO MORROW SOME STILL MORE BEWILDERING JOY WOULD BEFALL HER HETTY HAD NEVER READ A NOVEL IF SHE HAD EVER SEEN ONE I THINK THE WORDS WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO HARD FOR HER
AND A PAPER CAP ON HIS HEAD HAS THE STRONG CONSCIENCE AND THE STRONG SENSE THE BLENDED SUSCEPTIBILITY AND SELF COMMAND OF OUR FRIEND ADAM HE WAS NOT AN AVERAGE MAN YET SUCH MEN AS HE ARE REARED HERE AND THERE IN EVERY GENERATION OF OUR PEASANT ARTISANS
IT WOULD ALWAYS BE A HARD STRUGGLE WITH HIS MOTHER HE KNEW SHE WOULD BE JEALOUS OF ANY WIFE HE MIGHT CHOOSE AND SHE HAD SET HER MIND ESPECIALLY AGAINST HETTY PERHAPS FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THAT SHE SUSPECTED HETTY TO BE THE WOMAN HE HAD CHOSEN
AND THINK THERE'S NOBODY BUT ME KNOWS ABOUT THIS AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU AS IF I WAS YOUR BROTHER YOU'RE THE SAME AS EVER TO ME FOR I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'VE DONE ANY WRONG KNOWINGLY HETTY HAD LAID HER HAND ON THE LETTER BUT ADAM DID NOT LOOSE IT TILL HE HAD DONE SPEAKING
IT'S LIKE AS IF IT WAS A NEW STRENGTH TO ME HE SAID TO HIMSELF TO LOVE HER AND KNOW AS SHE LOVES ME
YOU HAVE A MIND THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THIS FULLY ADAM WHEN YOU ARE CALM DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN'T ENTER INTO THE ANGUISH THAT DRIVES YOU INTO THIS STATE OF REVENGEFUL HATRED BUT
BUT WHEN I SEE YOU'RE BEING MADE LOVE TO BY A GENTLEMAN AS CAN NEVER MARRY YOU AND DOESNA THINK O MARRYING YOU I FEEL BOUND T INTERFERE FOR YOU I CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT IT TO THEM AS ARE THE PLACE O YOUR PARENTS FOR THAT MIGHT BRING WORSE TROUBLE THAN'S NEEDFUL
THIS DESIRABLE EVENT OF MISSUS POYSER'S COMING DOWNSTAIRS HAPPENED IN THE EARLY PART OF FEBRUARY WHEN SOME MILD WEATHER THAWED THE LAST PATCH OF SNOW ON THE BINTON HILLS
BUT THE DINNER WAS GOOD AN IF THERE'S ANYBODY HASNA ENJOYED IT IT MUST BE THE FAULT OF HIS OWN INSIDE AN AS FOR THE RECTOR'S COMPANY IT'S WELL KNOWN AS THAT'S WELCOME T ALL THE PARISH WHEREVER HE MAY BE AN I HOPE
OH SIR THE MEN ARE MOSTLY SO TONGUE TIED YOU'RE FORCED PARTLY TO GUESS WHAT THEY MEAN AS YOU DO WI THE DUMB CREATURS WHAT YOU THINK YOU COULD HAVE MADE IT BETTER FOR HIM SAID MISTER IRWINE LAUGHING WELL SIR WHEN I WANT TO SAY ANYTHING I CAN MOSTLY FIND WORDS TO SAY IT IN THANK GOD
WHEN MISSUS POYSER BURST IN WITH THE DESPERATE DETERMINATION TO HAVE HER SAY OUT THIS ONCE THOUGH IT WERE TO RAIN NOTICES TO QUIT AND THE ONLY SHELTER WERE THE WORK HOUSE THEN SIR IF I MAY SPEAK AS
AS SHE DWELLS ON WRETCHED THOUGHTS AND THROUGH THIS GATE SHE CAN GET INTO A FIELD PATH BEHIND THE WIDE THICK HEDGEROWS
I FEAR YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OUT AGAIN TO DAY YOU NEEDN'T DECEIVE ME SIR SAID ADAM LOOKING HARD AT MISTER IRWINE AND SPEAKING IN A TONE OF ANGRY SUSPICION YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF ME I ONLY WANT JUSTICE
DINNER TIME WHEN ADAM HEARD THAT HE WAS TO DINE UPSTAIRS WITH THE LARGE TENANTS HE FELT RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE AT THE IDEA OF BEING EXALTED IN THIS WAY ABOVE HIS MOTHER AND SETH WHO WERE TO DINE IN THE CLOISTERS BELOW
THE NEXT SUNDAY ADAM JOINED THE POYSERS ON THEIR WAY OUT OF CHURCH HOPING FOR AN INVITATION TO GO HOME WITH THEM
IF I'D THOUGHT OF IT EARLIER I WOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME MEASURES FOR FINDING HER OUT SAID MISTER IRWINE BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW I FEAR WELL ADAM I MUST GO NOW TRY TO GET SOME REST TO NIGHT
NOW LET US GO ON FOR WE'RE PRETTY NIGH THE LAST I THINK I KNOW WHAT TO DO NEVER FEAR SAID BARTLE MOVING ON THE NEWS WILL BE GOOD SAUCE TO MY DINNER AYE AYE MY BOY YOU'LL GET ON
FOR YOUR NAME'S NO BETTER THAN A BRIMSTONE MATCH IN EVERYBODY'S NOSE IF IT ISNA TWO THREE OLD FOLKS AS YOU THINK O SAVING YOUR SOUL BY GIVING EM A BIT O FLANNEL AND A DROP O PORRIDGE AN YOU MAY BE RIGHT THINKING IT'LL TAKE BUT LITTLE TO SAVE YOUR SOUL
AND IT IS NOW SETTLED THAT ADAM SHALL MANAGE THE WOODS A CHANGE WHICH I AM SURE WILL BE VERY MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF THE ESTATE AND I HOPE YOU WILL BY AND BY JOIN ME IN DRINKING HIS HEALTH AND IN WISHING HIM ALL THE PROSPERITY IN LIFE THAT HE DESERVES
WHAT WAS IN HER MIND SHE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THINK OF IMPRESSIONS AS PURELY SPIRITUAL MONITIONS THAT SHE LOOKED FOR NO MATERIAL VISIBLE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THE VOICE BUT THIS SECOND TIME SHE LOOKED ROUND
AND SEATED HIMSELF ON A LOOSE STONE AGAINST THE LOW WALL TO WATCH TILL HE SHOULD SEE THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE LEAVING THE HAMLET AND WINDING UP THE HILL HE CHOSE THIS SPOT ALMOST AT THE TOP OF THE HILL
BECAUSE IT WAS AWAY FROM ALL EYES NO HOUSE NO CATTLE NOT EVEN A NIBBLING SHEEP NEAR NO PRESENCE BUT THE STILL LIGHTS AND SHADOWS AND THE GREAT EMBRACING SKY
SOMETHING LIKE THIS SENSE OF ENLARGED BEING WAS IN ADAM'S MIND THIS SUNDAY MORNING AS HE RODE ALONG IN VIVID RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST
FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT THEY SHOULD ALL LIVE TOGETHER TILL SETH WAS MARRIED AND THEY MIGHT HAVE BUILT A BIT THEMSELVES TO THE OLD HOUSE AND MADE MORE ROOM
ADAM PICTURED TO HIMSELF MISSUS POYSER EXAMINING IT WITH HER KEEN EYE AND TRYING IN VAIN TO FIND OUT A DEFICIENCY AND OF COURSE CLOSE TO MISSUS POYSER STOOD HETTY AND ADAM WAS AGAIN BEGUILED FROM CALCULATIONS AND CONTRIVANCES INTO DREAMS AND HOPES
EVEN WITHOUT THE FINAL THREAT HER HUSBAND REALLY ALARMED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR LEAVING THE OLD PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN BRED AND BORN FOR HE BELIEVED THE OLD SQUIRE HAD SMALL SPITE ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING
TO PREACH IN A COTTAGE THERE AS HER HABIT WAS
I'LL WAIT PATIENTLY THAT WAS ADAM'S WISE RESOLUTION AND IT THROVE EXCELLENTLY FOR THE FIRST TWO OR THREE WEEKS ON THE NOURISHMENT IT GOT
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THINKING I KNEW BETTER THAN THEM AS BELONGED TO ME
THERE ARE OCCASIONS ON WHICH TWO SERVANT GIRLS AND A WAGGONER MAY BE A FORMIDABLE AUDIENCE AND AS THE SQUIRE RODE AWAY ON HIS BLACK PONY EVEN THE GIFT OF SHORT SIGHTEDNESS DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM BEING AWARE THAT MOLLY
THE TIME ULL SEEM LONG HE WAS LOOKING AT HER FONDLY AND HIS STRONG HAND HELD HERS IN ITS GRASP HETTY FELT A SENSE OF PROTECTION IN HIS PRESENCE SHE WAS USED TO IT NOW IF SHE COULD HAVE HAD THE PAST UNDONE AND KNOWN NO OTHER LOVE THAN HER QUIET LIKING FOR ADAM
WOULD HAVE TOO STRONG A GRASP UPON HER
AND SELFISH EVEN A BLASPHEMOUS SPIRIT WHICH REJOICES AND IS THANKFUL OVER THE PAST EVIL THAT HAS BLIGHTED OR CRUSHED ANOTHER BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MADE A SOURCE OF UNFORESEEN GOOD TO OURSELVES
SHE ALWAYS CITED IT AFTERWARDS AS A CASE OF PREVISION WHICH REALLY HAD SOMETHING MORE IN IT THAN HER OWN REMARKABLE PENETRATION THAT THE MOMENT SHE SET EYES ON THE SQUIRE SHE SAID TO HERSELF I SHOULDNA WONDER IF HE'S COME ABOUT THAT MAN
SHE WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL IN HER PALENESS AND AGITATION WITH HER DARK CHILDISH EYES DILATED AND HER BREATH SHORTER THAN USUAL ADAM'S HEART YEARNED OVER HER AS HE LOOKED AT HER
THERE MUST BE AN END TO THE WHOLE THING AT ONCE IT WAS TOO FOOLISH AND YET HE HAD BEEN SO DETERMINED THIS MORNING BEFORE HE WENT TO GAWAINE'S
AND JUST AS I COME UP BY THE BIG ASH TREE I SEE THE MAN TOP BOOTS COMING ALONG ON A BALD FACED HOSS I WISH I MAY NEVER STIR IF I DIDN'T AND I STOOD STILL TILL HE COME UP AND I SAYS GOOD MORNING SIR
AND FIND MY BIRTHDAY ALE GOOD MISTER IRWINE AND I ARE COME TO TASTE IT WITH YOU AND I AM SURE WE SHALL ALL LIKE ANYTHING THE BETTER THAT THE RECTOR SHARES WITH US ALL EYES WERE NOW TURNED ON MISTER POYSER WHO
AT THREE O'CLOCK THAT DAY WHEN HETTY WAS ON THE COACH THAT WAS TO TAKE HER THEY SAID TO LEICESTER PART OF THE LONG LONG WAY TO WINDSOR SHE FELT DIMLY THAT SHE MIGHT BE TRAVELLING ALL THIS WEARY JOURNEY TOWARDS THE BEGINNING OF NEW MISERY
YES HE WOULD GO AND SEE HER THIS EVENING IT WAS SO LONG SINCE HE HAD BEEN AT THE HALL FARM HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GO TO THE NIGHT SCHOOL TO SEE WHY BARTLE MASSEY HAD NOT BEEN AT CHURCH YESTERDAY FOR HE FEARED HIS OLD FRIEND WAS ILL
I WISH I'D ASKED HER TO WRITE TO ME THOUGH HE THOUGHT AND YET
WHILE SUCH OBSERVATIONS WERE BEING BUZZED ABOUT MINGLED WITH WONDERINGS AS TO WHAT THE OLD SQUIRE MEANT TO DO FOR A BAILIFF AND WHETHER HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A STEWARD THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAD RISEN AND WERE WALKING ROUND TO THE TABLE WHERE THE WIVES AND CHILDREN SAT
HE IS A LITTLE TOO FLUSHED AND EXALTED WITH THAT FIRST DRAUGHT SHE OFFERS HIM TO CARE MUCH ABOUT THE TASTE OF THE SECOND HE TREADS THE EARTH WITH A VERY ELASTIC STEP AS HE WALKS AWAY FROM HER AND MAKES LIGHT OF ALL DIFFICULTIES
IT LOOKED SO MUCH MORE LIKE INNOCENT DISTRESS THAN ILL HUMOUR AND THE SEVERE ADAM FELT NO MOVEMENT OF DISAPPROBATION HE ONLY FELT A SORT OF AMUSED PITY AS IF HE HAD SEEN A KITTEN SETTING UP ITS BACK OR A LITTLE BIRD WITH ITS FEATHERS RUFFLED
GLAD TO GET OUT OF THE GROVE WHICH SURELY WAS HAUNTED BY HIS EVIL GENIUS THOSE BEECHES AND SMOOTH LIMES THERE WAS SOMETHING ENERVATING IN THE VERY SIGHT OF THEM
ADAM YOU PERCEIVE WAS BY NO MEANS A MARVELLOUS MAN NOR PROPERLY SPEAKING A GENIUS YET I WILL NOT PRETEND THAT HIS WAS AN ORDINARY CHARACTER AMONG WORKMEN
AND HIS FRIENDS SHOULD DELIGHT TO HONOUR HIM I KNOW ADAM BEDE WELL I KNOW WHAT HE IS AS A WORKMAN AND WHAT HE HAS BEEN AS A SON AND BROTHER AND I AM SAYING THE SIMPLEST TRUTH WHEN I SAY THAT I RESPECT HIM AS MUCH AS I RESPECT ANY MAN LIVING
ADAM COULD NEVER CEASE TO MOURN OVER THAT MYSTERY OF HUMAN SORROW WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT SO CLOSE TO HIM HE COULD NEVER THANK GOD FOR ANOTHER'S MISERY AND IF I WERE CAPABLE OF THAT NARROW SIGHTED JOY IN ADAM'S BEHALF
HE WAS DISSATISFIED WITH HIMSELF IRRITATED MORTIFIED HE NO SOONER FIXED HIS MIND ON THE PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF GIVING WAY TO THE EMOTIONS WHICH HAD STOLEN OVER HIM TO DAY
THERE WAS A CRUEL FORCE IN THEIR CALM CERTAINTY WHICH THREATENED TO GRAPPLE AND CRUSH HER FLIMSY HOPES AND FANCIES
YES ADAM I AND THE CHAPLAIN HAVE BOTH BEEN WITH HER THIS EVENING DID YOU ASK HER SIR DID YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME YES SAID MISTER IRWINE WITH SOME HESITATION
COMING FROM BETWEEN THE GREY HOUSES AND GRADUALLY APPROACHING THE FOOT OF THE HILL SLOWLY ADAM THOUGHT BUT DINAH WAS REALLY WALKING AT HER USUAL PACE WITH A LIGHT QUIET STEP
ADAM UNDERSTOOD DINAH'S HASTE TO GO AWAY AND DREW HOPE RATHER THAN DISCOURAGEMENT FROM IT
HE WAS MUCH TOO ACUTE A MAN NOT TO SEE THROUGH THE WHOLE BUSINESS AND TO FORESEE PERFECTLY WHAT WOULD BE HIS WIFE'S VIEW OF THE SUBJECT BUT HE DISLIKED GIVING UNPLEASANT ANSWERS UNLESS IT WAS ON A POINT OF FARMING PRACTICE
IT IS NOT MY PLACE AT PRESENT TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS I ONLY MEET YOUR GOOD HOPES CONCERNING ME BY TELLING YOU THAT MY OWN HOPES CORRESPOND TO THEM THAT WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM ME I DESIRE TO FULFIL
THAT'S A PLACE O TRUST AND THEE'T ABOVE A COMMON WORKMAN NOW AYE SAID ADAM BUT NOBODY KNOWS A WORD ABOUT IT YET I HAVEN'T GIVEN NOTICE TO MISTER BURGE ABOUT LEAVING HIM AND I DON'T LIKE TO TELL ANYBODY ELSE ABOUT IT BEFORE HE KNOWS FOR HE'LL BE A GOOD BIT HURT I DOUBT
THIS IS NOT WHAT HE MEANT TO SAY HIS ARM IS STEALING ROUND THE WAIST AGAIN IT IS TIGHTENING ITS CLASP HE IS BENDING HIS FACE NEARER AND NEARER TO THE ROUND CHEEK HIS LIPS ARE MEETING THOSE POUTING CHILD LIPS AND FOR A LONG MOMENT TIME HAS VANISHED
THOUGHT THAT SO SENSIBLE A MAN AS ADAM MUST BE REFLECTING ON THE SMALL VALUE OF BEAUTY IN A WOMAN WHOSE TEMPER WAS BAD MARY WAS A GOOD GIRL NOT GIVEN TO INDULGE IN EVIL FEELINGS BUT SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT SINCE HETTY HAD A BAD TEMPER IT WAS BETTER ADAM SHOULD KNOW IT
WITHOUT HAVING SEEN HIM SHE REACHES THE FIRST TURNING TOWARDS THE HERMITAGE WALKING SLOWLY HE IS NOT THERE SHE HATES THE LEVERET THAT RUNS ACROSS THE PATH SHE HATES EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT WHAT SHE LONGS FOR
I SHOULD THINK A MAN AS HAS LIVED AMONG THE GENTRY FROM A BY
THAT IT FILLED YOU WITH A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE OVERARCHING SKY HAD A MILDER MORE SOOTHING INFLUENCE THAN USUAL ON THIS ALMOST CLOUDLESS DAY ADAM'S DOUBTS AND FEARS MELTED UNDER THIS INFLUENCE
AND THE SOUND OF THE GURGLING BROOK IF YOU CAME CLOSE TO ONE SPOT BEHIND A SMALL BUSH WOULD BE MINGLED FOR YOUR EAR WITH A DESPAIRING HUMAN SOB NO WONDER MAN'S RELIGION HAS MUCH SORROW IN IT NO WONDER HE NEEDS A SUFFERING GOD
THAT THE GUILT OF HER CRIME LIES WITH HIM AND THAT HE OUGHT TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT IT IS NOT FOR US MEN TO APPORTION THE SHARES OF MORAL GUILT AND RETRIBUTION WE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID MISTAKES
TO HIS GREAT DELIGHT HETTY SAID YES I'D AS SOON SHE LIVED WITH US AS NOT HETTY'S MIND WAS OPPRESSED AT THAT MOMENT WITH A WORSE DIFFICULTY THAN POOR LISBETH'S WAYS SHE COULD NOT CARE ABOUT THEM
THE WIVES AND DAUGHTERS DID DOUBLE WORK IN EVERY FARMHOUSE THAT THE MAIDS MIGHT GIVE THEIR HELP IN TOSSING THE HAY AND WHEN ADAM WAS MARCHING ALONG THE LANES WITH HIS BASKET OF TOOLS OVER HIS SHOULDER HE CAUGHT THE SOUND OF JOCOSE TALK AND RINGING LAUGHTER FROM BEHIND THE HEDGES
PERHAPS THAT'S THE LAST HYMN BEFORE THEY COME AWAY ADAM THOUGHT I'LL WALK BACK A BIT AND TURN AGAIN TO MEET HER FARTHER OFF THE VILLAGE HE WALKED BACK TILL HE GOT NEARLY TO THE TOP OF THE HILL AGAIN
AS IF SHE HAD SUDDENLY THOUGHT OF AN OBJECT TOWARDS WHICH IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO HASTEN SOON SHE IS IN THE SCANTLANDS WHERE THE GRASSY LAND SLOPES GRADUALLY DOWNWARDS AND SHE LEAVES THE LEVEL GROUND TO FOLLOW THE SLOPE FARTHER ON THERE IS A CLUMP OF TREES ON THE LOW GROUND
AND HE THOUGHT HE MUST WRITE HIMSELF HE MUST ASK DINAH NOT TO LEAVE HIM IN PAINFUL DOUBT LONGER THAN WAS NEEDFUL HE SAT UP LATE ONE NIGHT TO WRITE HER A LETTER BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE BURNT IT AFRAID OF ITS EFFECT
THAT DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE FETCHING AND CARRYING YOU WILL NOT HAVE MISSUS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE WHO THOUGHT THAT THIS ENTRANCE INTO PARTICULARS INDICATED A DISTANT INCLINATION TO COMPROMISE ON MISSUS POYSER'S PART
SHE WANTS TO BE QUITE QUIET IN HER OLD WAY FOR A WHILE AND I'VE NO RIGHT TO BE IMPATIENT AND INTERRUPTING HER WITH MY WISHES SHE'S TOLD ME WHAT HER MIND IS AND SHE'S NOT A WOMAN TO SAY ONE THING AND MEAN ANOTHER
AN WE ALL HOPE AS HE'LL LIVE TO SEE US OLD FOLKS AN OUR CHILDREN GROWN TO MEN AN WOMEN AN YOUR HONOUR A FAMILY MAN I'VE NO MORE TO SAY AS CONCERNS THE PRESENT TIME AN SO WE'LL DRINK OUR YOUNG SQUIRE'S HEALTH THREE TIMES THREE
THAT HE WAS FIXED ON AS THE SECOND BROADEST MAN MARTIN POYSER THE YOUNGER AS THE BROADEST WAS TO BE PRESIDENT AND MISTER CASSON AS NEXT BROADEST WAS TO BE VICE OWING TO THIS ARRANGEMENT ADAM BEING OF COURSE
I THINK SHE HAS NOT A GOOD METHOD AS YOU HAVE INDEED SIR I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SAID MISSUS POYSER IN A HARD VOICE ROLLING AND UNROLLING HER KNITTING AND LOOKING ICILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS SHE CONTINUED TO STAND OPPOSITE THE SQUIRE
BUT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER THE RESOLUTION BEGAN TO DWINDLE PERCEPTIBLY AND SHOWED DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS OF EXHAUSTION THE WEEKS WERE UNUSUALLY LONG DINAH MUST SURELY HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE UP HER MIND
RATHER THAN FROM THEIR POCKET AND OF THESE BARTLE MASSEY WAS ONE HIS LAME WALK WAS RATHER SLOWER THAN USUAL ON THIS WARM DAY SO ADAM LINGERED BEHIND WHEN THE BELL RANG FOR DINNER THAT HE MIGHT WALK UP WITH HIS OLD FRIEND
FOR LET US DO WHAT WE WILL IT'S ONLY MAKING USE O THE SPERRIT AND THE POWERS THAT HA BEEN GIVEN TO US
BLOOD ULL BEAR IT BUT I'LL NOT MAKE A MARTYR O MYSELF AND WEAR MYSELF TO SKIN AND BONE AND WORRET MYSELF AS IF I WAS A CHURN WI BUTTER A COMING IN'T FOR NO LANDLORD IN ENGLAND NOT IF HE WAS KING GEORGE HIMSELF
YOU'RE LIKELY TO FIND MISTER THURLE AN EXCELLENT NEIGHBOUR I ASSURE YOU SUCH A ONE AS YOU WILL FEEL GLAD TO HAVE ACCOMMODATED BY THE LITTLE PLAN I'M GOING TO MENTION ESPECIALLY AS I HOPE YOU WILL FIND IT AS MUCH TO YOUR OWN ADVANTAGE AS HIS
APPARENTLY CROSSED BY SOME THOUGHT WHICH JARS WITH THE SINGING PERHAPS IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN ALREADY IN THE SECRET YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE GUESSED WHAT SAD MEMORIES WHAT WARM AFFECTION WHAT TENDER FLUTTERING HOPES HAD THEIR HOME IN THIS ATHLETIC BODY WITH THE BROKEN FINGER NAILS
BY WHICH HIS DIM BLURRED SIGHT OF MEN AS TREES WALKING HAD BEEN EXCHANGED FOR CLEAR OUTLINE AND EFFULGENT DAY THE GROWTH OF HIGHER FEELING WITHIN US IS LIKE THE GROWTH OF FACULTY
ADAM PAUSED AND LOOKED AT HETTY WHO WAS PLUCKING THE LEAVES FROM THE FILBERT TREES AND TEARING THEM UP IN HER HAND HER LITTLE PLANS AND PRECONCERTED SPEECHES HAD ALL FORSAKEN HER LIKE AN ILL LEARNT LESSON UNDER THE TERRIBLE AGITATION PRODUCED BY ADAM'S WORDS
AND HALF SUPPLY MOLLY'S PLACE TOO WHILE THAT GOOD DAMSEL WAITED ON HER MISTRESS AND SHE SEEMED TO THROW HERSELF SO ENTIRELY INTO HER NEW FUNCTIONS WORKING WITH A GRAVE STEADINESS WHICH WAS NEW IN HER THAT MISTER POYSER OFTEN TOLD ADAM SHE WAS WANTING TO SHOW HIM WHAT A GOOD HOUSEKEEPER HE WOULD HAVE
SHE MUST GO AWAY GO WHERE THEY CAN'T FIND HER AFTER THE FIRST ON COMING OF HER GREAT DREAD SOME WEEKS AFTER HER BETROTHAL TO ADAM SHE HAD WAITED AND WAITED IN THE BLIND VAGUE HOPE THAT SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN TO SET HER FREE FROM HER TERROR BUT SHE COULD WAIT NO LONGER
MY SOUL IS SO KNIT TO YOURS THAT IT IS BUT A DIVIDED LIFE I LIVE WITHOUT YOU AND THIS MOMENT NOW YOU ARE WITH ME AND I FEEL THAT OUR HEARTS ARE FILLED WITH THE SAME LOVE I HAVE A FULNESS OF STRENGTH
THOUGH THEIR MERRIMENT IS OF A POOR BLUNDERING SORT NOT AT ALL LIKE THE MERRIMENT OF BIRDS AND PERHAPS THERE IS NO TIME IN A SUMMER'S DAY MORE CHEERING THAN WHEN THE WARMTH OF THE SUN IS JUST BEGINNING TO TRIUMPH OVER THE FRESHNESS OF THE MORNING
LIKE THOSE CLUMSY BELLS ROUND THE COWS NECKS IT HAS RATHER A COARSE SOUND WHEN IT COMES CLOSE AND MAY EVEN GRATE ON YOUR EARS PAINFULLY BUT HEARD FROM FAR OFF IT MINGLES VERY PRETTILY WITH THE OTHER JOYOUS SOUNDS OF NATURE MEN'S MUSCLES MOVE BETTER WHEN THEIR SOULS ARE MAKING MERRY MUSIC
THAT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE AN AMUSEMENT ON BOTH SIDES OR IF IT BECAME SERIOUS THERE WAS NO OBSTACLE TO MARRIAGE BUT THIS LITTLE THING WOULD BE SPOKEN ILL OF DIRECTLY IF SHE HAPPENED TO BE SEEN WALKING WITH HIM AND THEN THOSE EXCELLENT PEOPLE THE POYSERS
THE SIGHT OF THEM WOULD GIVE A MAN SOME ENERGY ARTHUR LOST HIMSELF AMONG THE NARROW OPENINGS IN THE FERN WINDING ABOUT WITHOUT SEEKING ANY ISSUE TILL THE TWILIGHT DEEPENED ALMOST TO NIGHT UNDER THE GREAT BOUGHS AND THE HARE LOOKED BLACK AS IT DARTED ACROSS HIS PATH
SIGN HER SOUL AWAY I'VE A RIGHT TO SPEAK FOR I MAKE ONE QUARTER O THE RENT AND SAVE ANOTHER QUARTER
WAS BEGINNING A MILD REMONSTRANCE EXPLANATORY OF THE INCONVENIENCE HE SHOULD FIND IN HAVING TO BUY AND SELL MORE STOCK WITH
BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO COME TO ANY BUT FLUCTUATING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT HETTY'S FEELINGS SHE WAS LIKE A KITTEN AND HAD THE SAME DISTRACTINGLY PRETTY LOOKS THAT MEANT NOTHING FOR EVERYBODY THAT CAME NEAR HER
WHICH SHE HAD HEARD OF FROM SETH AND WHEN HETTY HAD READ THIS LETTER ALOUD TO HER UNCLE HE HAD SAID I WISH DINAH UD COME AGAIN NOW FOR SHE'D BE A COMFORT TO YOUR AUNT WHEN YOU'RE GONE
SHE CLUNG TO THE COMFORTING HOPEFUL WORDS ARTHUR HAD UTTERED IN THEIR LAST MEETING
AND NOW POYSER AS SATCHELL IS LAID UP I AM INTENDING TO LET THE CHASE FARM TO A RESPECTABLE TENANT I'M TIRED OF HAVING A FARM ON MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IS MADE THE BEST OF IN SUCH CASES AS YOU KNOW
WHEN THERE IS JUST A LINGERING HINT OF EARLY COOLNESS TO KEEP OFF LANGUOR UNDER THE DELICIOUS INFLUENCE OF WARMTH THE REASON ADAM WAS WALKING ALONG THE LANES AT THIS TIME WAS BECAUSE HIS WORK FOR THE REST OF THE DAY LAY AT A COUNTRY HOUSE ABOUT THREE MILES OFF
IT WAS ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK WHEN HETTY SET OFF AND THE SLIGHT HOAR FROST THAT HAD WHITENED THE HEDGES IN THE EARLY MORNING HAD DISAPPEARED AS THE SUN MOUNTED THE CLOUDLESS SKY BRIGHT FEBRUARY DAYS HAVE A STRONGER CHARM OF HOPE ABOUT THEM THAN ANY OTHER DAYS IN THE YEAR
ON ONE OF THESE DAYS SOON AFTER HER AUNT CAME DOWN HETTY WENT TO TREDDLESTON TO BUY SOME OF THE WEDDING THINGS WHICH WERE WANTING AND WHICH MISSUS POYSER HAD SCOLDED HER FOR NEGLECTING OBSERVING THAT SHE SUPPOSED
BUT THE PLEASURE I FEEL IN HAVING MY OWN HEALTH DRUNK BY YOU WOULD NOT BE PERFECT IF WE DID NOT DRINK THE HEALTH OF MY GRANDFATHER WHO HAS FILLED THE PLACE OF BOTH PARENTS TO ME
HELD IT FIRMLY BETWEEN HER CLASPED HANDS SAY WHY I SAY YOU MAY DO AS YOU LIKE
COME YOU'LL GO ON WITH US ADAM MISTER POYSER SAID WHEN THEY REACHED THE TURNING AND AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN THE FIELDS ADAM VENTURED TO OFFER HIS ARM TO HETTY THE CHILDREN SOON GAVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY OF LINGERING BEHIND A LITTLE AND THEN ADAM SAID
SAID BARTLE MASSEY RISING HASTILY AND UNFASTENING THE DOOR IT WAS MISTER IRWINE ADAM ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR WITH INSTINCTIVE RESPECT AS MISTER IRWINE APPROACHED HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND I'M LATE ADAM
IS DINAH MORRIS COME TO EM SIR SETH SAID THEY'D SENT FOR HER NO MISTER POYSER TELLS ME SHE WAS NOT COME WHEN HE LEFT THEY'RE AFRAID THE LETTER HAS NOT REACHED HER
BUT THERE IS A STILL OLDER FRIEND OF MINE THAN ADAM BEDE PRESENT AND I NEED NOT TELL YOU THAT IT IS MISTER IRWINE I'M SURE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME THAT WE MUST DRINK NO OTHER PERSON'S HEALTH UNTIL WE HAVE DRUNK HIS I KNOW YOU HAVE ALL REASON TO LOVE HIM
HE WOULD HAVE STARTED UP TO MAKE ANOTHER IF HE HAD NOT KNOWN THE EXTREME IRREGULARITY OF SUCH A COURSE AS IT WAS HE FOUND AN OUTLET FOR HIS FEELING IN DRINKING HIS ALE UNUSUALLY FAST AND SETTING DOWN HIS GLASS WITH A SWING OF HIS ARM AND A DETERMINED RAP
ADAM ON A WORKING DAY NOTWITHSTANDING MISTER CRAIG'S PROPHECY THE DARK BLUE CLOUD DISPERSED ITSELF WITHOUT HAVING PRODUCED THE THREATENED CONSEQUENCES THE WEATHER AS HE OBSERVED THE NEXT MORNING THE WEATHER YOU SEE S A TICKLISH THING
AND SEIZED HIS HAT WHICH LAY ON THE TABLE BUT HE STOOD STILL THEN AND LOOKED AT MISTER IRWINE AS IF HE HAD A QUESTION TO ASK WHICH IT WAS YET DIFFICULT TO UTTER BARTLE MASSEY ROSE QUIETLY TURNED THE KEY IN THE DOOR
BUT ADAM HAD NO SOONER CAUGHT HIS IMAGINATION LEAPING FORWARD IN THIS WAY MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE THAN HE CHECKED HIMSELF A PRETTY BUILDING I'M MAKING WITHOUT EITHER BRICKS OR TIMBER I'M UP THE GARRET A'READY AND HAVEN'T SO MUCH AS DUG THE FOUNDATION
WHICH WAS BEING PUT IN REPAIR FOR THE SON OF A NEIGHBOURING SQUIRE AND HE HAD BEEN BUSY SINCE EARLY MORNING WITH THE PACKING OF PANELS DOORS AND CHIMNEY PIECES IN A WAGGON WHICH WAS NOW GONE ON BEFORE HIM WHILE JONATHAN BURGE HIMSELF HAD RIDDEN TO THE SPOT ON HORSEBACK
AND AS TO THIS NEW EMPLOYMENT I'VE TAKEN IN HAND I'LL ONLY SAY THAT I TOOK IT AT CAPTAIN DONNITHORNE'S DESIRE AND THAT I'LL TRY TO FULFIL HIS EXPECTATIONS I'D WISH FOR NO BETTER LOT THAN TO WORK UNDER HIM AND TO KNOW THAT WHILE I WAS GETTING MY OWN BREAD I WAS TAKING CARE OF HIS INT'RESTS
MISSUS POYSER WAS QUITE AGREEABLY SURPRISED THAT HETTY WISHED TO GO AND SEE DINAH AND TRY TO BRING HER BACK TO STAY OVER THE WEDDING THE SOONER SHE WENT THE BETTER SINCE THE WEATHER WAS PLEASANT NOW AND ADAM WHEN HE CAME IN THE EVENING SAID
HITHERTO HE HAD FELT KEENLY THE DANGER THAT SOME OTHER MAN MIGHT STEP IN AND GET POSSESSION OF HETTY'S HEART AND HAND WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS STILL IN A POSITION THAT MADE HIM SHRINK FROM ASKING HER TO ACCEPT HIM EVEN IF HE HAD HAD A STRONG HOPE THAT SHE WAS FOND OF HIM
HE HAS ONE ARM OVER THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AND HE SEEMS TO BE LOOKING DOWN AT HIS CLASPED HANDS HE IS ROUSED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
BUT KEEPING NEAR THE DOOR I'M SURE I SHOULD LIKE MY BREAKFAST BETTER IF I KNEW THE BUTTER AND CREAM CAME FROM THIS DAIRY THANK YOU THAT REALLY IS A PLEASANT SIGHT UNFORTUNATELY MY SLIGHT TENDENCY TO RHEUMATISM MAKES ME AFRAID OF DAMP
FOR THE OLD SQUIRE'S VISITS TO HIS TENANTRY WERE RARE AND THOUGH MISSUS POYSER HAD DURING THE LAST TWELVEMONTH RECITED MANY IMAGINARY SPEECHES MEANING EVEN MORE THAN MET THE EAR
HE LOOKED NEITHER AWKWARD NOR EMBARRASSED BUT STOOD IN HIS USUAL FIRM UPRIGHT ATTITUDE WITH HIS HEAD THROWN A LITTLE BACKWARD AND HIS HANDS PERFECTLY STILL IN THAT ROUGH DIGNITY WHICH IS PECULIAR TO INTELLIGENT HONEST WELL BUILT WORKMEN
HE MAY BE WEAK BUT HE IS NOT CALLOUS NOT COLDLY SELFISH I AM PERSUADED
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I KNOW BECAUSE I BELIEVE YOU CAN KEEP A STILL TONGUE IN YOUR HEAD IF YOU LIKE AND I HOPE YOU'LL NOT LET DROP A WORD TILL IT'S COMMON TALK FOR I'VE PARTICULAR REASONS AGAINST ITS BEING KNOWN TRUST TO ME MY BOY TRUST TO ME
AND NOW THERE IS ONE MORE THING I WISH TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY SHARE MY PLEASURE ABOUT IT AS I HOPE AND BELIEVE YOU WILL I THINK THERE CAN BE NO MAN HERE WHO HAS NOT A RESPECT AND SOME OF YOU I AM SURE HAVE A VERY HIGH REGARD FOR MY FRIEND ADAM BEDE
SO ADAM WAS CONSOLED FOR THE DISAPPOINTMENT HE HAD FELT WHEN SETH HAD COME BACK FROM HIS VISIT TO SNOWFIELD AND SAID IT WAS NO USE DINAH'S HEART WASNA TURNED TOWARDS MARRYING
AS SHE WONNA LIKE T DO AN THEN WE NEEDNA PART THE PLATTERS AN THINGS AS HA STOOD ON THE SHELF TOGETHER SIN AFORE THEE WAST BORN THERE WAS ONLY ONE CLOUD THAT NOW AND THEN CAME ACROSS ADAM'S SUNSHINE HETTY SEEMED UNHAPPY SOMETIMES
LET US ALL SIT DOWN ADAM TOOK HIS CHAIR AGAIN MECHANICALLY AND BARTLE FOR WHOM THERE WAS NO CHAIR REMAINING SAT ON THE BED IN THE BACKGROUND HAVE YOU SEEN HER SIR
WHISTLING LOW WHILE HE CONSIDERS HOW A DIFFICULTY ABOUT A FLOOR JOIST OR A WINDOW FRAME IS TO BE OVERCOME OR AS HE PUSHES ONE OF THE YOUNGER WORKMEN ASIDE AND TAKES HIS PLACE IN UPHEAVING A WEIGHT OF TIMBER SAYING LET ALONE LAD
BUT THEN THAT'S THE DEEPEST CURSE OF ALL THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BLACKNESS OF IT IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE MY POOR HETTY SHE CAN NEVER BE MY SWEET HETTY AGAIN THE PRETTIEST THING GOD HAD MADE
HE WAS A GOOD DEAL MOVED BY THIS PUBLIC TRIBUTE VERY NATURALLY FOR HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE OF ALL HIS LITTLE WORLD AND IT WAS UNITING TO DO HIM HONOUR BUT HE FELT NO SHYNESS ABOUT SPEAKING NOT BEING TROUBLED WITH SMALL VANITY OR LACK OF WORDS
WITH AND TOTTY WAS WATCHING THEM WITH A PUPPYLIKE AIR OF CONTEMPLATION IT WAS BUT A SHORT TIME HARDLY TWO MONTHS SINCE ADAM HAD HAD HIS MIND FILLED WITH DELICIOUS HOPES AS HE STOOD BY HETTY'S SIDE IN THIS GARDEN
IT HAD BEEN SETTLED VERY DEFINITELY WHAT MISTER POYSER WAS TO DO WHEN THE YOUNG SQUIRE SHOULD APPEAR AND FOR THE LAST FIVE MINUTES HE HAD BEEN IN A STATE OF ABSTRACTION WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE DARK PICTURE OPPOSITE
BUT NOW HE COULD NOT HELP SAYING TO HIMSELF THAT THE HEAVIEST PART OF HIS BURDEN WAS REMOVED AND THAT EVEN BEFORE THE END OF ANOTHER YEAR HIS CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT BE BROUGHT INTO A SHAPE THAT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO THINK OF MARRYING
THE PARTNERSHIP WITH JONATHAN BURGE WAS NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF AT PRESENT THERE WERE THINGS IMPLICITLY TACKED TO IT THAT HE COULD NOT ACCEPT BUT ADAM THOUGHT THAT HE AND SETH MIGHT CARRY ON A LITTLE BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES IN ADDITION TO THEIR JOURNEYMAN'S WORK
AND WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM THE CAUSEWAY WHEN HIS MASTER BECKONED YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR AND YOU MAY GO SPINNIN UNDERHAND WAYS O DOING US A MISCHIEF FOR YOU'VE GOT OLD HARRY TO YOUR FRIEND THOUGH NOBODY ELSE IS
NOT AS I'M A FINDING FAUT WI MY HUSBAND FOR IF HE'S A MAN O FEW WORDS WHAT HE SAYS HE'LL STAND TO I'M SURE I NEVER SAW A PRETTIER PARTY THAN THIS ARTHUR SAID LOOKING ROUND AT THE APPLE CHEEKED CHILDREN MY AUNT AND THE MISS IRWINES WILL COME UP AND SEE YOU PRESENTLY
BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO THROW AWAY AN UNRIPE APPLE THAT SHE HAD SET HER SMALL TEETH IN HEGH TOTTY SAID ADAM COME AND RIDE ON MY SHOULDER EVER SO HIGH YOU'LL TOUCH THE TOPS O THE TREES
BUT DON'T YOU THINK YOUR WORK WILL RATHER BE LESSENED THAN INCREASED IN THIS WAY THERE IS SO MUCH MILK REQUIRED AT THE ABBEY THAT YOU WILL HAVE LITTLE INCREASE OF CHEESE AND BUTTER MAKING FROM THE ADDITION TO YOUR DAIRY
BESIDES ALL THIS HE HAD READ HIS BIBLE INCLUDING THE APOCRYPHAL BOOKS POOR RICHARD'S ALMANAC TAYLOR'S HOLY LIVING AND DYING THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS WITH BUNYAN'S LIFE AND HOLY WAR A GREAT DEAL OF BAILEY'S DICTIONARY VALENTINE AND ORSON
OR AT A TURNING BY THE WOOD WHERE A CLEAR BROOK WAS GURGLING BELOW AND SURELY IF THERE CAME A TRAVELLER TO THIS WORLD WHO KNEW NOTHING OF THE STORY OF MAN'S LIFE UPON IT
I HAVE COME ON SOMETHING BY THE ROADSIDE WHICH HAS REMINDED ME THAT I AM NOT IN LOAMSHIRE AN IMAGE OF A GREAT AGONY THE AGONY OF THE CROSS IT HAS STOOD PERHAPS BY THE CLUSTERING APPLE BLOSSOMS OR IN THE BROAD SUNSHINE BY THE CORNFIELD
SHE COULD GATHER NO ELATION OF SPIRITS NOW BY LOOKING FORWARD BUT ONLY BY LOOKING BACKWARD TO BUILD CONFIDENCE ON PAST WORDS AND CARESSES BUT OCCASIONALLY SINCE THURSDAY EVENING HER DIM ANXIETIES HAD BEEN ALMOST LOST BEHIND THE MORE DEFINITE FEAR
SO LONG AS HE HAD NO OTHER PROSPECT THAN THAT OF GROWING POVERTY WITH A GROWING FAMILY AND HIS SAVINGS HAD BEEN SO CONSTANTLY DRAWN UPON BESIDES THE TERRIBLE SWEEP OF PAYING FOR SETH'S SUBSTITUTE IN THE MILITIA THAT HE HAD NOT ENOUGH MONEY BEFOREHAND TO FURNISH EVEN A SMALL COTTAGE
IT SEEMS THEY HAD NO EXACT ADDRESS ADAM SAT RUMINATING A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN SAID
THE CAPTAIN HAS SENT TO SAY I'M TO DINE UPSTAIRS HE WISHES IT PARTICULAR MISTER MILLS SAYS SO I SUPPOSE IT UD BE BEHAVING ILL FOR ME NOT TO GO BUT I DON'T LIKE SITTING UP ABOVE THEE AND MOTHER AS IF I WAS BETTER THAN MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD THEE'T NOT TAKE IT UNKIND I HOPE
BUT THAT SORT OF GLOW DIES OUT MEMORY GETS SADLY DILUTED WITH TIME AND IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REVIVE US ADAM WAS NO LONGER SO CONFIDENT AS HE HAD BEEN HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT PERHAPS DINAH'S OLD LIFE
AS IT'S A MERCY THEY HANNA EAT THE CHILDREN LONG AGO
TO AWAIT ITS ARRIVAL AND DIRECT THE WORKMEN THIS LITTLE WALK WAS A REST TO ADAM AND HE WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY UNDER THE CHARM OF THE MOMENT IT WAS SUMMER MORNING IN HIS HEART AND HE SAW HETTY IN THE SUNSHINE A SUNSHINE WITHOUT GLARE
SO DEEP THAT THE ROOTS OF IT WOULD NEVER BE TORN AWAY HIS LOVE FOR DINAH WAS BETTER AND MORE PRECIOUS TO HIM FOR IT WAS THE OUTGROWTH OF THAT FULLER LIFE WHICH HAD COME TO HIM FROM HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH DEEP SORROW
HE WILL KNOW HE WILL SUFFER LONG AND BITTERLY HE HAS A HEART AND A CONSCIENCE I CAN'T BE ENTIRELY DECEIVED IN HIS CHARACTER I AM CONVINCED
TWO NEW ROOMS HAD BEEN RUN UP TO THE OLD HOUSE FOR HIS MOTHER AND SETH WERE TO LIVE WITH THEM AFTER ALL LISBETH HAD CRIED SO PITEOUSLY AT THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING ADAM THAT HE HAD GONE TO HETTY AND ASKED HER IF FOR THE LOVE OF HIM SHE WOULD PUT UP WITH HIS MOTHER'S WAYS AND CONSENT TO LIVE WITH HER
INDEED SIR IF IT'S ANYTHING T OUR ADVANTAGE
PERHAPS SHE HAD FOUND COMPLETE REPOSE WITHOUT HIM AND HAD CEASED TO FEEL ANY NEED OF HIS LOVE ON THE VERGE OF A DECISION WE ALL TREMBLE HOPE PAUSES WITH FLUTTERING WINGS BUT NOW AT LAST SHE WAS VERY NEAR
SHE SITS DOWN ON THE GRASSY BANK AGAINST THE STOOPING STEM OF THE GREAT OAK THAT HANGS OVER THE DARK POOL SHE HAS THOUGHT OF THIS POOL OFTEN IN THE NIGHTS OF THE MONTH THAT HAS JUST GONE BY AND NOW AT LAST SHE IS COME TO SEE IT
THE RED BUNCHES HETTY'S SWEET BLUSH IT CAME IMPORTUNATELY NOW ON THIS SAD EVENING WITH THE LOW HANGING CLOUDS BUT HE TRIED TO SUPPRESS IT LEST SOME EMOTION SHOULD IMPEL HIM TO SAY MORE THAN WAS NEEDFUL FOR HETTY'S SAKE
ARTHUR'S WAS A MUCH COMMONER BRITISH FACE AND THE SPLENDOUR OF HIS NEW FASHIONED CLOTHES WAS MORE AKIN TO THE YOUNG FARMER'S TASTE IN COSTUME THAN MISTER IRWINE'S POWDER AND THE WELL BRUSHED BUT WELL WORN BLACK WHICH SEEMED TO BE HIS CHOSEN SUIT FOR GREAT OCCASIONS
YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED IF I CAST A COVETOUS EYE ON YOUR CREAM AND BUTTER I DON'T EXPECT THAT MISSUS SATCHELL'S CREAM AND BUTTER WILL BEAR COMPARISON WITH YOURS I CAN'T SAY SIR I'M SURE IT'S SELDOM I SEE OTHER FOLKS'S BUTTER
WILL YOU CONTRIVE FOR ME TO WALK OUT IN THE GARDEN A BIT WITH YOU THIS EVENING IF IT KEEPS FINE HETTY I'VE SOMETHING PARTIC'LAR TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
IT WAS AS IF SHE HAD BEEN WOOED BY A RIVER GOD WHO MIGHT ANY TIME TAKE HER TO HIS WONDROUS HALLS BELOW A WATERY HEAVEN THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT WOULD COME SINCE THIS STRANGE ENTRANCING DELIGHT HAD COME IF A CHEST FULL OF LACE AND SATIN AND JEWELS HAD BEEN SENT HER FROM SOME UNKNOWN SOURCE
HE WOULD NOT KNOW THAT HIDDEN BEHIND THE APPLE BLOSSOMS OR AMONG THE GOLDEN CORN OR UNDER THE SHROUDING BOUGHS OF THE WOOD THERE MIGHT BE A HUMAN HEART BEATING HEAVILY WITH ANGUISH PERHAPS A YOUNG BLOOMING GIRL NOT KNOWING WHERE TO TURN FOR REFUGE FROM SWIFT ADVANCING SHAME
FOR SHE'S BETTER THAN I AM
BETHELL WILL DO THAT REGULARLY WITH THE CART AND PONY OH SIR BEGGING YOUR PARDON I'VE NEVER BEEN USED T HAVING GENTLEFOLKS'S SERVANTS COMING ABOUT MY BACK PLACES A MAKING LOVE TO BOTH THE GELLS AT ONCE
WHEN HE KNEW HE COULD NEVER MAKE YOU THE RIGHT AMENDS HE'S BEEN TRIFLING WITH YOU AND MAKING A PLAYTHING OF YOU AND CARING NOTHING ABOUT YOU AS A MAN OUGHT TO CARE YES HE DOES CARE FOR ME I KNOW BETTER NOR YOU HETTY BURST OUT
IN THE LABOUR OF OUR RIGHT ARM THE CUNNING OF OUR RIGHT HAND OR THE STILL CREATIVE ACTIVITY OF OUR THOUGHT LOOK AT ADAM THROUGH THE REST OF THE DAY AS HE STANDS ON THE SCAFFOLDING WITH THE TWO FEET RULER IN HIS HAND
AND KEEPING EM WITH THEIR HANDS ON THEIR HIPS LISTENING TO ALL MANNER O GOSSIP WHEN THEY SHOULD BE DOWN ON THEIR KNEES A SCOURING IF WE'RE TO GO TO RUIN IT SHANNA BE WI HAVING OUR BACK KITCHEN TURNED INTO A PUBLIC WELL POYSER
AND AFTER TEA WHEN THE BOYS WERE GOING INTO THE GARDEN AND TOTTY BEGGED TO GO WITH THEM
WHO ARE NEVER WONDERING WHAT IS THEIR BUSINESS IN THE WORLD I'M QUITE TAKEN BY SURPRISE HE SAID I DIDN'T EXPECT ANYTHING O THIS SORT FOR IT'S A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN MY WAGES
THAT IT WAS NOT IN THIS CASE A PURELY ABSTRACT QUESTION I DARESAY SAID MISSUS POYSER BITTERLY TURNING HER HEAD HALF WAY TOWARDS HER HUSBAND AND LOOKING AT THE VACANT ARM CHAIR I DARESAY IT'S TRUE FOR MEN
WHAT A FINE OLD KITCHEN THIS IS SAID MISTER DONNITHORNE LOOKING ROUND ADMIRINGLY HE ALWAYS SPOKE IN THE SAME DELIBERATE WELL CHISELLED POLITE WAY WHETHER HIS WORDS WERE SUGARY OR VENOMOUS
THE HIDDEN DREAD IT WAS A BUSY TIME FOR ADAM
WHEN I ASKED HER IF THERE WAS ANY ONE OF HER FAMILY WHOM SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO WHOM SHE COULD OPEN HER MIND SHE SAID WITH A VIOLENT SHUDDER TELL THEM NOT TO COME NEAR ME I WON'T SEE ANY OF THEM
FOR SHE HAD TREMBLED WHEN SHE FOUND HE WAS GOING HOME WITH THEM LEST HE SHOULD MEAN TO TELL
THAT UD BE POOR THANKS TO YOU TO SAY THAT YOU'VE KNOWN ME ALL THESE YEARS AND YET HAVEN'T SENSE ENOUGH TO FIND OUT A GREAT DEAL O THE TRUTH ABOUT ME YOU THINK IF I UNDERTAKE TO DO A BIT O WORK I'LL DO IT WELL BE MY PAY BIG OR LITTLE AND THAT'S TRUE
THERE'S NO PLEASURE LIVING IF YOU'RE TO BE CORKED UP FOR EVER AND ONLY DRIBBLE YOUR MIND OUT BY THE SLY LIKE A LEAKY BARREL I SHAN'T REPENT SAYING WHAT I THINK
SHE STARTED WHEN HE APPEARED AT THE END OF THE SIDE ALLEY AND LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH TWO GREAT DROPS ROLLING DOWN HER CHEEKS WHAT ELSE COULD HE DO BUT SPEAK TO HER IN A SOFT SOOTHING TONE AS IF SHE WERE A BRIGHT EYED SPANIEL WITH A THORN IN HER FOOT
THAT THE INTERVIEW MIGHT AFFECT HER FAVOURABLY BUT I GRIEVE TO SAY I HAVE SCARCELY ANY HOPE OF THAT SHE DIDN'T SEEM AGITATED WHEN I MENTIONED YOUR NAME SHE ONLY SAID NO IN THE SAME COLD OBSTINATE WAY AS USUAL
IT WAS AS IF YOU WAS A INSECT AND HE WAS GOING TO DAB HIS FINGER NAIL ON YOU HOWEVER SHE SAID YOUR SERVANT SIR AND CURTSIED WITH AN AIR OF PERFECT DEFERENCE AS SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM SHE WAS NOT THE WOMAN TO MISBEHAVE TOWARDS HER BETTERS
I LOVE IT DEARLY AND I'LL COME IF YOU ARE QUITE SURE NOBODY WILL HEAR ME AND BE DISTURBED SHE ADDED FEARING TO BE RUDE AND TREMBLING AT HER OWN BOLDNESS AS SHE SPOKE NOT A SOUL MY DEAR THE HOUSE IS EMPTY HALF THE DAY
WHY ONE SISTER SHOULD HAVE ALL SHE ASKED THE OTHER NOTHING IT WAS NOT TRUE SHE KNEW THAT AND TRIED TO PUT IT AWAY
SO KIND SO GOOD SO PATIENT WITH ME ALWAYS MY DEAR OLD FRITZ I DIDN'T VALUE HIM HALF ENOUGH WHEN I HAD HIM BUT NOW HOW I SHOULD LOVE TO SEE HIM FOR EVERYONE SEEMS GOING AWAY FROM ME AND I'M ALL ALONE
WELL I THINK WE ARE FOR THOUGH WE DO HAVE TO WORK WE MAKE FUN OF OURSELVES AND ARE A PRETTY JOLLY SET AS JO WOULD SAY JO DOES USE SUCH SLANG WORDS OBSERVED AMY WITH A REPROVING LOOK AT THE LONG FIGURE STRETCHED ON THE RUG
NOW BETH SAID AMY LONGING FOR HER TURN BUT READY TO WAIT THERE'S SO LITTLE OF HER I'M AFRAID TO SAY MUCH FOR FEAR SHE WILL SLIP AWAY ALTOGETHER THOUGH SHE IS NOT SO SHY AS SHE USED TO BE
YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO LEAVE OFF BOYISH TRICKS AND TO BEHAVE BETTER JOSEPHINE IT DIDN'T MATTER SO MUCH WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL BUT NOW YOU ARE SO TALL AND TURN UP YOUR HAIR
AND WHERE IN ALL THE WORLD COULD SHE FIND SOME USEFUL HAPPY WORK TO DO THAT WOULD TAKE THE PLACE OF THE LOVING SERVICE WHICH HAD BEEN ITS OWN REWARD SHE TRIED IN A BLIND HOPELESS WAY TO DO HER DUTY
ISN'T IT SPLENDID OF HIM DON'T YOU THINK HE'S THE DEAREST OLD MAN IN THE WORLD HERE'S THE KEY IN THE LETTER WE DIDN'T OPEN IT BUT WE ARE DYING TO KNOW WHAT HE SAYS
AND IF DIFFICULTIES WERE NECESSARY TO INCREASE THE SPLENDOR OF THE EFFORT WHAT COULD BE HARDER FOR A RESTLESS AMBITIOUS GIRL THAN TO GIVE UP HER OWN HOPES PLANS AND DESIRES AND CHEERFULLY LIVE FOR OTHERS
THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A CHRISTMAS DINNER AS THEY HAD THAT DAY THE FAT TURKEY WAS A SIGHT TO BEHOLD WHEN HANNAH SENT HIM UP STUFFED BROWNED AND DECORATED SO WAS THE PLUM PUDDING
AS HER EYES WENT FROM HER HUSBAND'S LETTER TO BETH'S SMILING FACE AND HER HAND CARRESSED THE BROOCH MADE OF GRAY AND GOLDEN CHESTNUT AND DARK BROWN HAIR WHICH THE GIRLS HAD JUST FASTENED ON HER BREAST
SO SHE ENJOYED HERSELF HEARTILY AND FOUND WHAT ISN'T ALWAYS THE CASE THAT HER GRANTED WISH WAS ALL SHE HAD HOPED PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS BLESSING THAT A GREATER WAS GIVEN HER AT ANY RATE SHE DESERVED BOTH
FORTUNATELY SHE WASN'T THINKING ABOUT HERSELF SO WHEN THE TIME CAME DOWN SHE DROPPED NOW IF SHE HAD BEEN THE HEROINE OF A MORAL STORYBOOK
OF COURSE I AM CRIED MEG SMOOTHING THE SILVERY FOLDS OF HER FIRST SILK DRESS FOR MISTER LAURENCE HAD INSISTED ON GIVING IT HOW CAN I BE OTHERWISE SAID MISSUS MARCH GRATEFULLY
I FELT SURE THEN THAT SOMETHING BETTER THAN WHAT YOU CALL THE MERCENARY SPIRIT HAD COME OVER HER AND A HINT HERE AND THERE IN HER LETTERS MADE ME SUSPECT THAT LOVE AND LAURIE WOULD WIN THE DAY HOW SHARP YOU ARE MARMEE AND HOW SILENT
IT WAS A CHEERFUL HOPEFUL LETTER FULL OF LIVELY DESCRIPTIONS OF CAMP LIFE MARCHES AND MILITARY NEWS AND ONLY AT THE END DID THE WRITER'S HEART OVER FLOW WITH FATHERLY LOVE AND LONGING FOR THE LITTLE GIRLS AT HOME
AS THEY SAT SEWING TOGETHER JO DISCOVERED HOW MUCH IMPROVED HER SISTER MEG WAS HOW WELL SHE COULD TALK HOW MUCH SHE KNEW ABOUT GOOD WOMANLY IMPULSES THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS HOW HAPPY SHE WAS IN HUSBAND AND CHILDREN
I REALLY NEED THEM SAID AMY DECIDEDLY MOTHER DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT OUR MONEY AND SHE WON'T WISH US TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING LET'S EACH BUY WHAT WE WANT AND HAVE A LITTLE FUN I'M SURE WE WORK HARD ENOUGH TO EARN IT CRIED JO EXAMINING THE HEELS OF HER SHOES IN A GENTLEMANLY MANNER
YES A NICE LONG LETTER HE IS WELL AND THINKS HE SHALL GET THROUGH THE COLD SEASON BETTER THAN WE FEARED HE SENDS ALL SORTS OF LOVING WISHES FOR CHRISTMAS AND AN ESPECIAL MESSAGE TO YOU GIRLS SAID MISSUS MARCH PATTING HER POCKET AS IF SHE HAD GOT A TREASURE THERE
IN HER EARNEST YET TIMID WAY OH SIR THEY DO CARE VERY VERY MUCH ARE YOU THE MUSICAL GIRL HE ASKED WITHOUT ANY STARTLING HEY AS HE LOOKED DOWN AT HER VERY KINDLY I'M BETH
DEAR ME HOW HAPPY AND GOOD WE'D BE IF WE HAD NO WORRIES SAID MEG WHO COULD REMEMBER BETTER TIMES
YOU NEVER SAID A WORD TO ME MOTHERS HAVE NEED OF SHARP EYES AND DISCREET TONGUES WHEN THEY HAVE GIRLS TO MANAGE I WAS HALF AFRAID TO PUT THE IDEA INTO YOUR HEAD LEST YOU SHOULD WRITE AND CONGRATULATE THEM BEFORE THE THING WAS SETTLED
SISTERS AND BROTHERS FRIENDS AND BABIES TILL THE BEST LOVER OF ALL COMES TO GIVE YOU YOUR REWARD
MEG CHEERFULLY BLACKENED AND BURNED HER WHITE HANDS COOKING DELICATE MESSES FOR THE DEAR WHILE AMY A LOYAL SLAVE OF THE RING CELEBRATED HER RETURN BY GIVING AWAY AS MANY OF HER TREASURES AS SHE COULD PREVAIL ON HER SISTERS TO ACCEPT
SHE SAID TO HERSELF WHEN HER FIRST EFFORTS FAILED AND SHE FELL INTO THE MOODY MISERABLE STATE OF MIND WHICH OFTEN COMES WHEN STRONG WILLS HAVE TO YIELD TO THE INEVITABLE BUT SOMEONE DID COME AND HELP HER
WE CAN'T DO MUCH BUT WE CAN MAKE OUR LITTLE SACRIFICES AND OUGHT TO DO IT GLADLY BUT I AM AFRAID I DON'T AND MEG SHOOK HER HEAD AS SHE THOUGHT REGRETFULLY OF ALL THE PRETTY THINGS SHE WANTED
SACRED MOMENTS WHEN HEART TALKED TO HEART IN THE SILENCE OF THE NIGHT TURNING AFFLICTION TO A BLESSING WHICH CHASTENED GRIEF AND STRENGTHNED LOVE FEELING THIS JO'S BURDEN SEEMED EASIER TO BEAR
THOUGH JO DID NOT RECOGNIZE HER GOOD ANGELS AT ONCE BECAUSE THEY WORE FAMILIAR SHAPES AND USED THE SIMPLE SPELLS BEST FITTED TO POOR HUMANITY OFTEN SHE STARTED UP AT NIGHT THINKING BETH CALLED HER
HER FACE IS RATHER THIN AND PALE JUST NOW WITH WATCHING AND ANXIETY BUT I LIKE TO LOOK AT IT FOR IT HAS GROWN GENTLER AND HER VOICE IS LOWER SHE DOESN'T BOUNCE BUT MOVES QUIETLY
BUT THE OLD GENTLEMAN NOT BEING AWARE OF HER INFIRMITY STARED AT HER SO HARD FROM UNDER HIS HEAVY EYEBROWS AND SAID HEY
AND I SHALL PROVIDE THE SLIPPERS FOR HE TOLD ME TO TAKE SPECIAL CARE OF MOTHER WHILE HE WAS GONE
HOW WILL WE GIVE THE THINGS ASKED MEG
BEFORE MISSUS MARCH COULD REPLY MISTER LAURENCE WENT ON WITH AN ODD LITTLE NOD AND SMILE THEY NEEDN'T SEE OR SPEAK TO ANYONE BUT RUN IN AT ANY TIME FOR I'M SHUT UP IN MY STUDY AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE LAURIE IS OUT A GREAT DEAL
EYES WIDE OPEN AND HER CHEEKS RED WITH EXCITEMENT OF THIS UNUSUAL PERFORMANCE
YOU LIKE IT MOTHER SAID JO AS THEY LAID DOWN THE CLOSELY WRITTEN SHEETS AND LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER YES I HOPED IT WOULD BE SO EVER SINCE AMY WROTE THAT SHE HAD REFUSED FRED
I SUSPECT SHE IS RIGHT AND THAT I'VE BEEN CODDLING THE FELLOW AS IF I'D BEEN HIS GRANDMOTHER LET HIM DO WHAT HE LIKES AS LONG AS HE IS HAPPY
PLEASE SAY SOMETHING NICE FOR SHE HAS TRIED SO HARD AND BEEN SO VERY VERY GOOD TO ME SAID BETH IN HER FATHER'S EAR HE LAUGHED AND LOOKED ACROSS AT THE TALL GIRL WHO SAT OPPOSITE
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO PLEASANT MEADOWS
WAS IT ALL SELF PITY LONELINESS OR LOW SPIRITS OR WAS IT THE WAKING UP OF A SENTIMENT WHICH HAD BIDED ITS TIME AS PATIENTLY AS ITS INSPIRER
AND FROM WHICH SHE CAME WITH FRESH COURAGE RECOVERED CHEERFULNESS AND A MORE SUBMISSIVE SPIRIT FOR THE PARENTS WHO HAD TAUGHT ONE CHILD TO MEET DEATH WITHOUT FEAR WERE TRYING NOW TO TEACH ANOTHER TO ACCEPT LIFE WITHOUT DESPONDENCY OR DISTRUST
IF MEG HAD WANTED A REWARD FOR HOURS OF PATIENT LABOR SHE RECEIVED IT IN THE HEARTY PRESSURE OF HER FATHER'S HAND AND THE APPROVING SMILE HE GAVE HER WHAT ABOUT JO
NEXT DAY HAVING SEEN BOTH THE OLD AND YOUNG GENTLEMAN OUT OF THE HOUSE BETH AFTER TWO OR THREE RETREATS FAIRLY GOT IN AT THE SIDE DOOR AND MADE HER WAY AS NOISELESSLY AS ANY MOUSE TO THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE HER IDOL STOOD
TEARS THAT WERE MUTE REMINDERS OF A GREATER GRIEF THAN JO'S AND BROKEN WHISPERS MORE ELOQUENT THAN PRAYERS BECAUSE HOPEFUL RESIGNATION WENT HAND IN HAND WITH NATURAL SORROW
CHAPTER SIX BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL THE BIG HOUSE DID PROVE A PALACE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT TOOK SOME TIME FOR ALL TO GET IN AND BETH FOUND IT VERY HARD TO PASS THE LIONS OLD MISTER LAURENCE WAS THE BIGGEST ONE
A BURNT OFFERING HAS BEEN MADE TO VANITY THIS HARDENED PALM HAS EARNED SOMETHING BETTER THAN BLISTERS AND I'M SURE THE SEWING DONE BY THESE PRICKED FINGERS WILL LAST A LONG TIME SO MUCH GOOD WILL WENT INTO THE STITCHES MEG MY DEAR
AND IT TAKES A GOOD SHAKE TO BRING THEM DOWN BOYS GO NUTTING AND I DON'T CARE TO BE BAGGED BY THEM RETURNED JO PASTING AWAY AT THE KITE WHICH NO WIND THAT BLOWS WOULD EVER CARRY UP FOR DAISY HAD TIED HERSELF ON AS A BOB
VERY FEW LETTERS WERE WRITTEN IN THOSE HARD TIMES THAT WERE NOT TOUCHING ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH FATHERS SENT HOME
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE SHEARING SOBERED OUR BLACK SHEEP BUT I DO KNOW THAT IN ALL WASHINGTON I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING BEAUTIFUL ENOUGH TO BE BOUGHT WITH THE FIVE AND TWENTY DOLLARS
I COULD SAID JO AS SHE CONSTRUCTED A KITE FOR DEMI IN THE TOPSY TURVY NURSERY IT'S JUST WHAT YOU NEED TO BRING OUT THE TENDER WOMANLY HALF OF YOUR NATURE JO YOU ARE LIKE A CHESTNUT BURR PRICKLY OUTSIDE
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE SHUT UP FOR HOURS WITH A NERVOUS FUSSY OLD LADY WHO KEEPS YOU TROTTING IS NEVER SATISFIED AND WORRIES YOU TILL YOU'RE READY TO FLY OUT THE WINDOW OR CRY IT'S NAUGHTY TO FRET BUT I DO THINK WASHING DISHES AND KEEPING THINGS TIDY IS THE WORST WORK IN THE WORLD
IT WAS A COMFORTABLE ROOM THOUGH THE CARPET WAS FADED AND THE FURNITURE VERY PLAIN FOR A GOOD PICTURE OR TWO HUNG ON THE WALLS BOOKS FILLED THE RECESSES CHRYSANTHEMUMS AND CHRISTMAS ROSES BLOOMED IN THE WINDOWS AND A PLEASANT ATMOSPHERE OF HOME PEACE PERVADED IT
OH DEAR YES HE LIKED IT AMAZINGLY AND WAS SO TOUCHED AND PLEASED BY THAT CONFIDING LITTLE KISS THAT ALL HIS CRUSTINESS VANISHED AND HE JUST SET HER ON HIS KNEE AND LAID HIS WRINKLED CHEEK
BEARING A BASKET OF FRUIT AND FLOWERS IN ONE HAND
THE GIRLS WILL HELP YOU ABOUT THEM AND I WILL PAY FOR THE MAKING UP REPLIED MISSUS MARCH WHO TOOK PECULIAR PLEASURE IN GRANTING BETH'S REQUESTS BECAUSE SHE SO SELDOM ASKED ANYTHING FOR HERSELF
HEART'S EASE IS MY FAVORITE FLOWER AND THESE WILL ALWAYS REMIND ME OF THE GENTLE GIVER
LOOK UNDER YOUR PILLOWS CHRISTMAS MORNING AND YOU WILL FIND YOUR GUIDEBOOK REPLIED MISSUS MARCH THEY TALKED OVER THE NEW PLAN WHILE OLD HANNAH CLEARED THE TABLE THEN OUT CAME THE FOUR LITTLE WORK BASKETS AND THE NEEDLES FLEW AS THE GIRLS MADE SHEETS FOR AUNT MARCH
WOULDN'T SOME OF YOUR GIRLS LIKE TO RUN OVER AND PRACTICE ON IT NOW AND THEN JUST TO KEEP IT IN TUNE YOU KNOW MA'AM BETH TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND PRESSED HER HANDS TIGHTLY TOGETHER TO KEEP FROM CLAPPING THEM FOR THIS WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE TEMPTATION AND THE THOUGHT OF PRACTICING ON THAT SPLENDID INSTRUMENT QUITE TOOK HER BREATH AWAY
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU AND MOTHER AND BETH SAID JO MORE TOUCHED BY HER FATHER'S WORDS THAN BY ANY AMOUNT OF PRAISE FROM THE WORLD SO TAUGHT BY LOVE AND SORROW JO WROTE HER LITTLE STORIES AND SENT THEM AWAY TO MAKE FRIENDS FOR THEMSELVES
WE DON'T SAY MUCH BUT WE SEE IT
IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME SHE WENT AND KNOCKED AT THE STUDY DOOR BEFORE SHE GAVE HERSELF TIME TO THINK AND WHEN A GRUFF VOICE CALLED OUT COME IN SHE DID GO IN RIGHT UP TO MISTER LAURENCE WHO LOOKED QUITE TAKEN ABACK AND HELD OUT HER HAND SAYING
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO AND THANK HIM SAID JO BY WAY OF A JOKE FOR THE IDEA OF THE CHILD'S REALLY GOING NEVER ENTERED HER HEAD
SITTING IN BETH'S LITTLE CHAIR CLOSE BESIDE HIM JO TOLD HER TROUBLES
AMY FOLLOWED BUT SHE POKED HER HANDS OUT STIFFLY BEFORE HER AND JERKED HERSELF ALONG AS IF SHE WENT BY MACHINERY AND HER OW WAS MORE SUGGESTIVE OF PINS BEING RUN INTO HER THAN OF FEAR AND ANGUISH
IT'S TOO BAD BUT IT CAN'T BE HELPED SO YOU MUST TRY TO BE CONTENTED WITH MAKING YOUR NAME BOYISH AND PLAYING BROTHER TO US GIRLS
BROOMS AND DISHCLOTHS NEVER COULD BE AS DISTASTEFUL AS THEY ONCE HAD BEEN FOR BETH HAD PRESIDED OVER BOTH AND SOMETHING OF HER HOUSEWIFELY SPIRIT SEEMED TO LINGER AROUND THE LITTLE MOP AND THE OLD BRUSH
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT YOU BACK WHISPERED BETH WHO SAT ON HER FATHER'S KNEE RATHER A ROUGH ROAD FOR YOU TO TRAVEL MY LITTLE PILGRIMS ESPECIALLY THE LATTER PART OF IT
SHE DIDN'T SAY PERHAPS NEVER BUT EACH SILENTLY ADDED IT THINKING OF FATHER FAR AWAY WHERE THE FIGHTING WAS NOBODY SPOKE FOR A MINUTE THEN MEG SAID IN AN ALTERED TONE
MINE IS SO ELASTIC IT NEVER SEEMS FULL NOW AND I USED TO BE QUITE CONTENTED WITH MY FAMILY I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT I DO AND MISSUS MARCH SMILED HER WISE SMILE AS JO TURNED BACK THE LEAVES TO READ WHAT AMY SAID OF LAURIE
IT'S BAD ENOUGH TO BE A GIRL ANYWAY WHEN I LIKE BOY'S GAMES AND WORK AND MANNERS
AS HE SOMEWHAT INCOHERENTLY EXPLAINED AND AMY THE DIGNIFIED TUMBLED OVER A STOOL AND NEVER STOPPING TO GET UP HUGGED AND CRIED OVER HER FATHER'S BOOTS IN THE MOST TOUCHING MANNER MISSUS MARCH WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER HERSELF
DON'T I WISH I COULD GO AS A DRUMMER A VIVAN WHAT'S ITS NAME OR A NURSE SO I COULD BE NEAR HIM AND HELP HIM EXCLAIMED JO WITH A GROAN IT MUST BE VERY DISAGREEABLE TO SLEEP IN A TENT AND EAT ALL SORTS OF BAD TASTING THINGS AND DRINK OUT OF A TIN MUG
AND TO HER UTTER SURPRISE IT WAS NOT ONLY PAID FOR BUT OTHERS REQUESTED LETTERS FROM SEVERAL PERSONS WHOSE PRAISE WAS HONOR FOLLOWED THE APPEARANCE OF THE LITTLE STORY NEWSPAPERS COPIED IT AND STRANGERS AS WELL AS FRIENDS ADMIRED IT
WHICH WERE RATHER BELIED BY EXPLOSIONS OF LAUGHTER WHEN THE TWO GOT TOGETHER SEVERAL DAYS OF UNUSUALLY MILD WEATHER FITLY USHERED IN A SPLENDID CHRISTMAS DAY
AS CHRISTMAS APPROACHED THE USUAL MYSTERIES BEGAN TO HAUNT THE HOUSE AND JO FREQUENTLY CONVULSED THE FAMILY BY PROPOSING UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE OR MAGNIFICENTLY ABSURD CEREMONIES IN HONOR OF THIS UNUSUALLY MERRY CHRISTMAS
MISSUS MARCH BEGAN TO THANK MISTER BROOKE FOR HIS FAITHFUL CARE OF HER HUSBAND AT WHICH MISTER BROOKE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT MISTER MARCH NEEDED REST AND SEIZING LAURIE HE PRECIPITATELY RETIRED THEN THE TWO INVALIDS WERE ORDERED TO REPOSE WHICH THEY DID
WHEN TWO PEOPLE LOVE AND LIVE FOR ONE ANOTHER AND THAT'S OUR COOL RESERVED AND WORLDLY AMY TRULY LOVE DOES WORK MIRACLES HOW VERY VERY HAPPY THEY MUST BE
LOOK THERE LOOK THERE BETH DID LOOK AND TURNED PALE WITH DELIGHT AND SURPRISE FOR THERE STOOD A LITTLE CABINET PIANO WITH A LETTER LYING ON THE GLOSSY LID DIRECTED LIKE A SIGN BOARD TO MISS ELIZABETH MARCH
SIGHED AMY WHEN WILL HE COME HOME MARMEE ASKED BETH WITH A LITTLE QUIVER IN HER VOICE NOT FOR MANY MONTHS DEAR UNLESS HE IS SICK
MEG LAUGHED FOR SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE A GLIMMER OF JO'S OLD SPIRIT BUT SHE FELT IT HER DUTY TO ENFORCE HER OPINION BY EVERY ARGUMENT IN HER POWER
ALL SORTS OF PLEASANT THINGS HAPPENED ABOUT THAT TIME FOR THE NEW FRIENDSHIP FLOURISHED LIKE GRASS IN SPRING EVERY ONE LIKED LAURIE AND HE PRIVATELY INFORMED HIS TUTOR THAT THE MARCHES WERE REGULARLY SPLENDID GIRLS
AS ONE MIGHT SHUT THE COVERS OF A LOVELY ROMANCE WHICH HOLDS THE READER FAST TILL THE END COMES AND HE FINDS HIMSELF ALONE IN THE WORKADAY WORLD AGAIN
NOW COME AND HEAR THE LETTER THEY ALL DREW TO THE FIRE
BUT I DON'T THINK THE LITTLE WE SHOULD SPEND WOULD DO ANY GOOD WE'VE EACH GOT A DOLLAR AND THE ARMY WOULDN'T BE MUCH HELPED BY OUR GIVING THAT
WHOM SHE TRUSTED AND LOVED AMY THOUGH THE YOUNGEST WAS A MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN HER OWN OPINION AT LEAST A REGULAR SNOW MAIDEN WITH BLUE EYES AND YELLOW HAIR CURLING ON HER SHOULDERS PALE AND SLENDER AND ALWAYS CARRYING HERSELF LIKE A YOUNG LADY MINDFUL OF HER MANNERS
WHICH WAS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD MAKING HOME HAPPY THOUGH SHE DIDN'T KNOW IT TILL HANNAH SAID WITH AN APPROVING SQUEEZE OF THE HAND YOU THOUGHTFUL CREETER YOU'RE DETERMINED WE SHAN'T MISS THAT DEAR LAMB EF YOU CAN HELP IT
I RATHER THINK SHE HASN'T GOT ANY SAID HER MOTHER YES I HAVE MINE IS DISHES AND DUSTERS AND ENVYING GIRLS WITH NICE PIANOS AND BEING AFRAID OF PEOPLE BETH'S BUNDLE WAS SUCH A FUNNY ONE THAT EVERYBODY WANTED TO LAUGH BUT NOBODY DID FOR IT WOULD HAVE HURT HER FEELINGS VERY MUCH
BUT I'LL TRULY TRY TO BE BETTER SO HE MAYN'T BE DISAPPOINTED IN ME BY AND BY WE ALL WILL CRIED MEG I THINK TOO MUCH OF MY LOOKS AND HATE TO WORK BUT WON'T ANY MORE IF I CAN HELP IT
DEVOTED TO HUMDRUM CARES A FEW SMALL PLEASURES AND THE DUTY THAT NEVER SEEMED TO GROW ANY EASIER I CAN'T DO IT I WASN'T MEANT FOR A LIFE LIKE THIS AND I KNOW I SHALL
NEVER HAVING KNOWN MOTHER OR SISTERS HE WAS QUICK TO FEEL THE INFLUENCES THEY BROUGHT ABOUT HIM AND THEIR BUSY LIVELY WAYS MADE HIM ASHAMED OF THE INDOLENT LIFE HE LED
YOU MIGHT PERHAPS FEEL LIKE GIVING ANOTHER ANSWER FORGIVE ME DEAR I CAN'T HELP SEEING THAT YOU ARE VERY LONELY AND SOMETIMES THERE IS A HUNGRY LOOK IN YOUR EYES THAT GOES TO MY HEART SO I FANCIED THAT YOUR BOY MIGHT FILL THE EMPTY PLACE IF HE TRIED NOW
NEVER THROWN AWAY AS SHE USED THEM JO FOUND HERSELF HUMMING THE SONGS BETH USED TO HUM IMITATING BETH'S ORDERLY WAYS AND GIVING THE LITTLE TOUCHES HERE AND THERE THAT KEPT EVERYTHING FRESH AND COZY
AND WHEN THE SIGHT OF THE LITTLE EMPTY BED MADE HER CRY WITH THE BITTER CRY OF UNSUBMISSIVE SORROW OH BETH COME BACK COME BACK SHE DID NOT STRETCH OUT HER YEARNING ARMS IN VAIN
WHICH CAUSED MISSUS MARCH TO SMILE AND SLIP AWAY
BUT AFTER HE HAD CALLED SAID SOMETHING FUNNY OR KIND TO EACH ONE OF THE GIRLS AND TALKED OVER OLD TIMES WITH THEIR MOTHER NOBODY FELT MUCH AFRAID OF HIM EXCEPT TIMID BETH THE OTHER LION WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE POOR AND LAURIE RICH FOR THIS MADE THEM SHY OF ACCEPTING FAVORS WHICH THEY COULD NOT RETURN
THEN THINGS WENT SMOOTHLY FOR DON PEDRO DEFIED THE WORLD IN A SPEECH OF TWO PAGES WITHOUT A SINGLE BREAK HAGAR THE WITCH CHANTED AN AWFUL INCANTATION OVER HER KETTLEFUL OF SIMMERING TOADS WITH WEIRD EFFECT
DUTY GREW SWEETER AND LIFE LOOKED MORE ENDURABLE SEEN FROM THE SAFE SHELTER OF HER MOTHER'S ARMS WHEN ACHING HEART WAS A LITTLE COMFORTED TROUBLED MIND LIKEWISE FOUND HELP FOR ONE DAY
BETH TROTTED TO AND FRO BETWEEN PARLOR KITCHEN QUIET AND BUSY WHILE AMY GAVE DIRECTIONS TO EVERYONE AS SHE SAT WITH HER HANDS FOLDED AS THEY GATHERED ABOUT THE TABLE MISSUS MARCH SAID WITH A PARTICULARLY HAPPY FACE I'VE GOT A TREAT FOR YOU AFTER SUPPER
NOW MOTHER DID YOU REALLY THINK I COULD BE SO SILLY AND SELFISH AFTER I'D REFUSED HIS LOVE WHEN IT WAS FRESHEST IF NOT BEST I KNEW YOU WERE SINCERE THEN JO
A STRONG PULL AND A PULL ALL TOGETHER BEFORE SOME OF US EVEN GET OUR FEET SET IN THE RIGHT WAY JO HAD GOT SO FAR SHE WAS LEARNING TO DO HER DUTY AND TO FEEL UNHAPPY IF SHE DID NOT
ACCEPT IT AND THE ALPINE MAID FROM LAURIE AND FROM JO HOW BETH LAUGHED WHEN SHE SAW IT HOW LAURIE RAN UP AND DOWN TO BRING IN THE GIFTS AND WHAT RIDICULOUS SPEECHES JO MADE AS SHE PRESENTED THEM
LOOKED AT HIS WIFE WITH AN INQUIRING LIFT OF THE EYEBROWS I LEAVE YOU TO IMAGINE ALSO WHY MISSUS MARCH GENTLY NODDED HER HEAD AND ASKED RATHER ABRUPTLY
ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE SECOND DAY SHE WENT OUT TO DO AN ERRAND AND GIVE POOR JOANNA THE INVALID DOLL HER DAILY EXERCISE AS SHE CAME UP THE STREET ON HER RETURN SHE SAW THREE YES FOUR HEADS POPPING IN AND OUT OF THE PARLOR WINDOWS
STOOD FOUR LITTLE WOODEN CHESTS IN A ROW EACH MARKED WITH ITS OWNERS NAME AND EACH FILLED WITH RELICS OF THE CHILDHOOD AND GIRLHOOD ENDED NOW FOR ALL JO GLANCED INTO THEM AND WHEN SHE CAME TO HER OWN
FOR I'M ALL WRONG MY DEAR NOTHING CAN COMFORT ME LIKE THIS HE ANSWERED WITH A FALTER IN HIS VOICE AND BOTH ARMS ROUND HER AS IF HE TOO NEEDED HELP AND DID NOT FEAR TO ASK FOR IT THEN
THE UNQUENCHABLES HAD DONE THEIR BEST TO BE WORTHY OF THE NAME FOR LIKE ELVES THEY HAD WORKED BY NIGHT AND CONJURED UP A COMICAL SURPRISE OUT IN THE GARDEN STOOD A STATELY SNOW MAIDEN CROWNED WITH HOLLY
IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL TO BE LOVED AS LAURIE LOVES ME HE ISN'T SENTIMENTAL DOESN'T SAY MUCH ABOUT IT BUT I SEE AND FEEL IT IN ALL HE SAYS AND DOES AND IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY AND SO HUMBLE
BUT I DON'T MIND WHISPERING TO MARMEE THAT I'D LIKE TO TRY ALL KINDS IT'S VERY CURIOUS BUT THE MORE I TRY TO SATISFY MYSELF WITH ALL SORTS OF NATURAL AFFECTIONS THE MORE I SEEM TO WANT I'D NO IDEA HEARTS COULD TAKE IN SO MANY
CAN I DO IT ASKED BETH A FEW WEEKS AFTER THAT EVENTFUL CALL OF HIS YES DEAR IT WILL PLEASE HIM VERY MUCH
AND TOUCHED A TENDER SPOT IN HER HEART
SAID BETH WHO WAS TOASTING HER FACE AND THE BREAD FOR TEA AT THE SAME TIME LET MARMEE THINK WE ARE GETTING THINGS FOR OURSELVES AND THEN SURPRISE HER WE MUST GO SHOPPING TOMORROW AFTERNOON MEG THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO ABOUT THE PLAY FOR CHRISTMAS NIGHT
AGAINST HER ROSY ONE FEELING AS IF HE HAD GOT HIS OWN LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER BACK AGAIN BETH CEASED TO FEAR HIM FROM THAT MOMENT AND SAT THERE TALKING TO HIM AS COZILY AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN HIM ALL HER LIFE FOR LOVE CASTS OUT FEAR
IT'S PROPER TO USE GOOD WORDS AND IMPROVE YOUR VOCABILARY RETURNED AMY WITH DIGNITY DON'T PECK AT ONE ANOTHER CHILDREN
BEFORE THEY WENT ON TO THEIR JOURNEY'S END ANSWERED BETH ADDING AS SHE SLIPPED OUT OF HER FATHER'S ARMS
JO NEVER KNEW HOW IT HAPPENED BUT SOMETHING GOT INTO THAT STORY THAT WENT STRAIGHT TO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO READ IT FOR WHEN HER FAMILY HAD LAUGHED AND CRIED OVER IT HER FATHER SENT IT MUCH AGAINST HER WILL TO ONE OF THE POPULAR MAGAZINES
SECRETLY REBELLING AGAINST IT ALL THE WHILE
IT MAKES ME CROSS AND MY HANDS GET SO STIFF I CAN'T PRACTICE WELL AT ALL AND BETH LOOKED AT HER ROUGH HANDS WITH A SIGH THAT ANY ONE COULD HEAR THAT TIME I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF YOU SUFFER AS I DO CRIED AMY
BUT YOU HAVE GOT ON BRAVELY AND I THINK THE BURDENS ARE IN A FAIR WAY TO TUMBLE OFF VERY SOON SAID MISTER MARCH LOOKING WITH FATHERLY SATISFACTION AT THE FOUR YOUNG FACES GATHERED ROUND HIM
AT NINE THEY STOPPED WORK AND SANG AS USUAL BEFORE THEY WENT TO BED NO ONE BUT BETH COULD GET MUCH MUSIC OUT OF THE OLD PIANO BUT SHE HAD A WAY OF SOFTLY TOUCHING THE YELLOW KEYS AND MAKING A PLEASANT ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE SIMPLE SONGS THEY SANG
AND HER FINDING IT A VERY CHARITABLE WORLD TO SUCH HUMBLE WANDERERS FOR THEY WERE KINDLY WELCOMED AND SENT HOME COMFORTABLE TOKENS TO THEIR MOTHER LIKE DUTIFUL CHILDREN WHOM GOOD FORTUNE OVERTAKES
IF I WASN'T TOO OLD FOR SUCH THINGS I'D RATHER LIKE TO PLAY IT OVER AGAIN SAID AMY WHO BEGAN TO TALK OF RENOUNCING CHILDISH THINGS AT THE MATURE AGE OF TWELVE WE NEVER ARE TOO OLD FOR THIS MY DEAR BECAUSE IT IS A PLAY WE ARE PLAYING ALL THE TIME IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
AND GRATITUDE CAN CONQUER PRIDE
A CLUSTER OF GRAVE YET CHEERFUL PANSIES ON A DEEPER PURPLE GROUND WAS PRONOUNCED VERY APPROPRIATE AND PRETTY AND BETH WORKED AWAY EARLY AND LATE WITH OCCASIONAL LIFTS OVER HARD PARTS SHE WAS A NIMBLE LITTLE NEEDLEWOMAN AND THEY WERE FINISHED BEFORE ANYONE GOT TIRED OF THEM
BUT SHE GOT NO FURTHER FOR JO QUENCHED HER BY SLAMMING DOWN THE WINDOW
BUT SILKY SOFT WITHIN AND A SWEET KERNAL IF ONE CAN ONLY GET AT IT LOVE WILL MAKE YOU SHOW YOUR HEART ONE DAY AND THEN THE ROUGH BURR WILL FALL OFF FROST OPENS CHESTNUT BURRS MA'AM
SO COME AND DRUM AWAY AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE AND I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO YOU HOW KIND YOU ARE SIR BETH BLUSHED LIKE A ROSE UNDER THE FRIENDLY LOOK HE WORE BUT SHE WAS NOT FRIGHTENED NOW
I KNOW I DO TEACHING THOSE TIRESOME CHILDREN NEARLY ALL DAY WHEN I'M LONGING TO ENJOY MYSELF AT HOME BEGAN MEG IN THE COMPLAINING TONE AGAIN YOU DON'T HAVE HALF SUCH A HARD TIME AS I DO SAID JO
ESPECIALLY AS TWO OF MEG'S MOST EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE
SLAPPING THE POCKET WHEREIN REPOSED THE LONG DESIRED UNDINE AND SINTRAM I'M SURE I AM ECHOED AMY PORING OVER THE ENGRAVED COPY OF THE MADONNA AND CHILD WHICH HER MOTHER HAD GIVEN HER IN A PRETTY FRAME
I MAY BE A LITTLE LATE BUT I SHALL SURELY COME
ROUND SHOULDERS HAD JO BIG HANDS AND FEET A FLYAWAY LOOK TO HER CLOTHES AND THE UNCOMFORTABLE APPEARANCE OF A GIRL WHO WAS RAPIDLY SHOOTING UP INTO A WOMAN AND DIDN'T LIKE IT ELIZABETH OR BETH AS EVERYONE CALLED HER
REACHED UP TO PICK IT GENTLY FROM THE BURR AND FIND THE KERNAL SOUND AND SWEET IF SHE SUSPECTED THIS SHE WOULD HAVE SHUT UP TIGHT AND BEEN MORE PRICKLY THAN EVER
AFTER MANY SERIOUS DISCUSSIONS WITH MEG AND JO THE PATTERN WAS CHOSEN THE MATERIALS BOUGHT AND THE SLIPPERS BEGUN
JO GAVE A DESPAIRING GROAN AND MEG LAUGHED OUTRIGHT WHILE BETH LET HER BREAD BURN AS SHE WATCHED THE FUN WITH INTEREST IT'S NO USE DO THE BEST YOU CAN WHEN THE TIME COMES AND IF THE AUDIENCE LAUGHS DON'T BLAME ME COME ON MEG
BUT BECAUSE I CARE MORE TO BE LOVED THAN WHEN HE WENT AWAY
SHE WENT TO THE STUDY AND LEANING OVER THE GOOD GRAY HEAD LIFTED TO WELCOME HER WITH A TRANQUIL SMILE SHE SAID VERY HUMBLY FATHER TALK TO ME AS YOU DID TO BETH
SHE STAYED TILL HANNAH CAME TO TAKE HER HOME TO DINNER BUT SHE HAD NO APPETITE AND COULD ONLY SIT AND SMILE UPON EVERYONE IN A GENERAL STATE OF BEATITUDE
AS FOR YOU AMY CONTINUED MEG YOU ARE ALTOGETHER TOO PARTICULAR AND PRIM YOUR AIRS ARE FUNNY NOW BUT YOU'LL GROW UP AN AFFECTED LITTLE GOOSE IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE I LIKE YOUR NICE MANNERS AND REFINED WAYS OF SPEAKING WHEN YOU DON'T TRY TO BE ELEGANT
IT WAS NOT AT ALL ROMANTIC BUT A HEARTY LAUGH SET EVERYBODY STRAIGHT AGAIN FOR HANNAH WAS DISCOVERED BEHIND THE DOOR SOBBING OVER THE FAT TURKEY WHICH SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO PUT DOWN WHEN SHE RUSHED UP FROM THE KITCHEN AS THE LAUGH SUBSIDED
WHEN AMY AND LAURIE WROTE OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT MISSUS MARCH FEARED THAT JO WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO REJOICE OVER IT BUT HER FEARS WERE SOON SET AT REST
SO THAT THESE HARD DAYS NEED NOT BE WASTED I KNOW THEY WILL REMEMBER ALL I SAID TO THEM THAT THEY WILL BE LOVING CHILDREN TO YOU WILL DO THEIR DUTY FAITHFULLY FIGHT THEIR BOSOM ENEMIES BRAVELY AND CONQUER THEMSELVES SO BEAUTIFULLY
BUT THE GIRLS WOULD NOT LEAVE THEIR FATHER SO THE GUESTS DEPARTED EARLY AND AS TWILIGHT GATHERED THE HAPPY FAMILY SAT TOGETHER ROUND THE FIRE JUST A YEAR AGO WE WERE GROANING OVER THE DISMAL CHRISTMAS WE EXPECTED TO HAVE
YOU WON'T STOP I KNOW AS LONG AS YOU CAN TRAIL ROUND IN A WHITE GOWN WITH YOUR HAIR DOWN AND WEAR GOLD PAPER JEWELRY YOU ARE THE BEST ACTRESS WE'VE GOT AND THERE'LL BE AN END OF EVERYTHING IF YOU QUIT THE BOARDS SAID JO WE OUGHT TO REHEARSE TONIGHT
YOU READ IT I CAN'T I FEEL SO QUEER OH IT IS TOO LOVELY AND BETH HID HER FACE IN JO'S APRON QUITE UPSET BY HER PRESENT JO OPENED THE PAPER AND BEGAN TO LAUGH FOR THE FIRST WORDS SHE SAW WERE MISS MARCH
OH TELL US WHAT THEY ARE CRIED MEG WHO SAT BESIDE HIM HERE IS ONE AND TAKING UP THE HAND WHICH LAY ON THE ARM OF HIS CHAIR HE POINTED TO THE ROUGHENED FOREFINGER A BURN ON THE BACK
AND IF THEY DON'T CARE TO COME WHY NEVER MIND HERE A LITTLE HAND SLIPPED INTO HIS AND BETH LOOKED UP
LEANED HER CHIN ON THE EDGE AND STARED ABSENTLY AT THE CHAOTIC COLLECTION TILL A BUNDLE OF OLD EXERCISE BOOKS CAUGHT HER EYE SHE DREW THEM OUT TURNED THEM OVER AND RELIVED THAT PLEASANT WINTER AT KIND MISSUS KIRKE'S
WITH THE BLUE ARMY SOCK AND BEGAN TO KNIT WITH ALL HER MIGHT LOSING NO TIME IN DOING THE DUTY THAT LAY NEAREST HER WHILE SHE RESOLVED IN HER QUIET LITTLE SOUL TO BE ALL THAT FATHER HOPED TO FIND HER WHEN THE YEAR BROUGHT ROUND THE HAPPY COMING HOME
SHE WAS NOT ELEGANTLY DRESSED BUT A NOBLE LOOKING WOMAN AND THE GIRLS THOUGHT THE GRAY CLOAK AND UNFASHIONABLE BONNET COVERED THE MOST SPLENDID MOTHER IN THE WORLD WELL DEARIES HOW HAVE YOU GOT ON TODAY
I LIKE TO PAY MY DEBTS SO I KNOW YOU WILL ALLOW THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO SEND YOU SOMETHING WHICH ONCE BELONGED TO THE LITTLE GRAND DAUGHTER HE LOST WITH HEARTY THANKS AND BEST WISHES I REMAIN YOUR GRATEFUL FRIEND AND HUMBLE SERVANT JAMES LAURENCE
BY BOTH SITTING IN ONE BIG CHAIR AND TALKING HARD MISTER MARCH TOLD HOW HE HAD LONGED TO SURPRISE THEM AND HOW WHEN THE FINE WEATHER CAME HE HAD BEEN ALLOWED BY HIS DOCTOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT
AS CHRISTIAN TOOK THE REFRESHMENT AFFORDED BY THE LITTLE ARBOR WHERE HE RESTED AS HE CLIMBED THE HILL CALLED DIFFICULTY WHY DON'T YOU WRITE
AND PUT YOUR HEART INTO IT MY DAUGHTER
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD JO WAS VERY TALL THIN AND BROWN AND REMINDED ONE OF A COLT FOR SHE NEVER SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HER LONG LIMBS WHICH WERE VERY MUCH IN HER WAY
YOU HAD ALL THE LOVELY THINGS YOU COULD COLLECT TO MAKE A CELESTIAL CITY WHAT FUN IT WAS ESPECIALLY GOING BY THE LIONS FIGHTING APOLLYON AND PASSING THROUGH THE VALLEY WHERE THE HOB GOBLINS WERE SAID JO
THE OLD GENTLEMAN SOFTLY STROKED THE HAIR OFF HER FOREHEAD AND STOOPING DOWN HE KISSED HER SAYING IN A TONE FEW PEOPLE EVER HEARD I HAD A LITTLE GIRL ONCE WITH EYES LIKE THESE GOD BLESS YOU MY DEAR GOOD DAY MADAM
OUR BURDENS ARE HERE OUR ROAD IS BEFORE US AND THE LONGING FOR GOODNESS AND HAPPINESS IS THE GUIDE THAT LEADS US THROUGH MANY TROUBLES AND MISTAKES TO THE PEACE WHICH IS A TRUE CELESTIAL CITY NOW MY LITTLE PILGRIMS SUPPOSE YOU BEGIN AGAIN
AS YOUNG READERS LIKE TO KNOW HOW PEOPLE LOOK WE WILL TAKE THIS MOMENT TO GIVE THEM A LITTLE SKETCH OF THE FOUR SISTERS WHO SAT KNITTING AWAY IN THE TWILIGHT WHILE THE DECEMBER SNOW FELL QUIETLY WITHOUT AND THE FIRE CRACKLED CHEERFULLY WITHIN
I THOUGHT I'D GET HER SOME WITH MY DOLLAR SAID BETH NO I SHALL CRIED AMY I'M THE OLDEST BEGAN MEG BUT JO CUT IN WITH A DECIDED
SAID AMY MUCH IMPRESSED BY THE NOTE TRY IT HONEY LET'S HEAR THE SOUND OF THE BABY PIANNY SAID HANNAH WHO ALWAYS TOOK A SHARE IN THE FAMILY JOYS AND SORROWS SO BETH TRIED IT AND EVERYONE PRONOUNCED IT THE MOST REMARKABLE PIANO EVER HEARD
SHE'D NEVER HAVE GONE IN HER RIGHT MIND CRIED HANNAH STARING AFTER HER WHILE THE GIRLS WERE RENDERED QUITE SPEECHLESS BY THE MIRACLE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN STILL MORE AMAZED IF THEY HAD SEEN WHAT BETH DID AFTERWARD
NOTHING DELIGHTED YOU MORE THAN TO HAVE ME TIE MY PIECE BAGS ON YOUR BACKS FOR BURDENS GIVE YOU HATS AND STICKS AND ROLLS OF PAPER AND LET YOU TRAVEL THROUGH THE HOUSE FROM THE CELLAR WHICH WAS THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION UP UP TO THE HOUSETOP WHERE
IN WHICH AMY REVELED LIKE A FLY IN A HONEYPOT EVERYTHING TURNED OUT WELL WHICH WAS A MERCY HANNAH SAID
LET US DO IT SAID MEG THOUGHTFULLY IT IS ONLY ANOTHER NAME FOR TRYING TO BE GOOD AND THE STORY MAY HELP US
BETH ATE NO MORE BUT CREPT AWAY TO SIT IN HER SHADOWY CORNER AND BROOD OVER THE DELIGHT TO COME TILL THE OTHERS WERE READY I THINK IT WAS SO SPLENDID IN FATHER TO GO AS CHAPLAIN WHEN HE WAS TOO OLD TO BE DRAFTED AND NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR A SOLDIER SAID MEG WARMLY
AND HAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED A VERY PRETTY RING WHICH SHE WEARS SO I CONCLUDE THAT SHE HAS LEARNED TO THINK OF OTHER PEOPLE MORE AND OF HERSELF LESS AND HAS DECIDED TO TRY AND MOLD HER CHARACTER AS CAREFULLY AS SHE MOLDS HER LITTLE CLAY FIGURES
AND SHE JUST ACTED OUT HER NATURE BEING SAD CROSS LISTLESS OR ENERGETIC AS THE MOOD SUGGESTED IT'S HIGHLY VIRTUOUS TO SAY WE'LL BE GOOD BUT WE CAN'T DO IT ALL AT ONCE AND IT TAKES A LONG PULL
DREW AMY TO HER LAP PREPARING TO ENJOY THE HAPPIEST HOUR OF HER BUSY DAY THE GIRLS FLEW ABOUT TRYING TO MAKE THINGS COMFORTABLE EACH IN HER OWN WAY MEG ARRANGED THE TEA TABLE JO BROUGHT WOOD AND SET CHAIRS DROPPING OVER TURNING AND CLATTERING EVERYTHING SHE TOUCHED
NOW AND THEN IN THIS WORKADAY WORLD THINGS DO HAPPEN IN THE DELIGHTFUL STORYBOOK FASHION
HE CAN'T GET INTO MISCHIEF IN THAT LITTLE NUNNERY OVER THERE AND MISSUS MARCH IS DOING MORE FOR HIM THAN WE CAN WHAT GOOD TIMES THEY HAD TO BE SURE
YOU KNOW THE REASON MOTHER PROPOSED NOT HAVING ANY PRESENTS THIS CHRISTMAS WAS BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE A HARD WINTER FOR EVERYONE AND SHE THINKS WE OUGHT NOT TO SPEND MONEY FOR PLEASURE WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFERING SO IN THE ARMY
WITH THE DELIGHTFUL ENTHUSIASM OF YOUTH THEY TOOK THE SOLITARY BOY INTO THEIR MIDST AND MADE MUCH OF HIM AND HE FOUND SOMETHING VERY CHARMING IN THE INNOCENT COMPANIONSHIP OF THESE SIMPLE HEARTED GIRLS
ARMY SHOES BEST TO BE HAD CRIED JO SOME HANDKERCHIEFS ALL HEMMED SAID BETH
WHEN THE DESPONDING FIT OVER SHADOWED JO I'VE NO HEART TO WRITE AND IF I HAD NOBODY CARES FOR MY THINGS
AND THE PRETTY RACK AND STOOL ALL COMPLETE ADDED MEG OPENING THE INSTRUMENT AND DISPLAYING ITS BEAUTIES
PROVIDENCE HAD TAKEN HER AT HER WORD
MISSUS MARCH BROKE THE SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED JO'S WORDS BY SAYING IN HER CHEERY VOICE DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU USED TO PLAY PILGRIMS PROGRESS WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE THINGS
THEIR CHEERFUL SOCIETY AND THE COMFORT HE TOOK IN THAT HUMBLE HOME OF THEIRS SO THEY SOON FORGOT THEIR PRIDE AND INTERCHANGED KINDNESSES WITHOUT STOPPING TO THINK WHICH WAS THE GREATER
BUT WHEN THE HELPFUL VOICE WAS SILENT THE DAILY LESSON OVER THE BELOVED PRESENCE GONE AND NOTHING REMAINED BUT LONELINESS AND GRIEF THEN JO FOUND HER PROMISE VERY HARD TO KEEP
FOR AS QUICK TO HEAR HER SOBBING AS SHE HAD BEEN TO HEAR HER SISTER'S FAINTEST WHISPER HER MOTHER CAME TO COMFORT HER NOT WITH WORDS ONLY BUT THE PATIENT TENDERNESS THAT SOOTHES BY A TOUCH
I VALUE THE WOMANLY SKILL WHICH KEEPS HOME HAPPY MORE THAN WHITE HANDS OR FASHIONABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS I'M PROUD TO SHAKE THIS GOOD INDUSTRIOUS LITTLE HAND AND HOPE I SHALL NOT SOON BE ASKED TO GIVE IT AWAY
AND TOLD SUCH CHARMING ANECDOTES THAT BETH FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO STAY IN HER DISTANT CORNER BUT CREPT NEARER AND NEARER AS IF FASCINATED
I'M NOT AND IF TURNING UP MY HAIR MAKES ME ONE I'LL WEAR IT IN TWO TAILS TILL I'M TWENTY CRIED JO PULLING OFF HER NET AND SHAKING DOWN A CHESTNUT MANE
HE WAS TIRED OF BOOKS AND FOUND PEOPLE SO INTERESTING NOW THAT MISTER BROOKE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE VERY UNSATISFACTORY REPORTS FOR LAURIE WAS ALWAYS PLAYING TRUANT AND RUNNING OVER TO THE MARCHES NEVER MIND LET HIM TAKE A HOLIDAY AND MAKE IT UP AFTERWARD
SHE DECIDED THAT SHE WOULD TRY AND IN HER FIRST ATTEMPT SHE FOUND THE HELPS I HAVE SUGGESTED STILL ANOTHER WAS GIVEN HER AND SHE TOOK IT NOT AS A REWARD BUT AS A COMFORT
A LITTLE WOMAN AND NOT BE ROUGH AND WILD BUT DO MY DUTY HERE INSTEAD OF WANTING TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE SAID JO THINKING THAT KEEPING HER TEMPER AT HOME WAS A MUCH HARDER TASK THAN FACING A REBEL OR TWO DOWN SOUTH BETH SAID NOTHING BUT WIPED AWAY HER TEARS
I'M NOT THE SCATTERBRAIN I WAS YOU MAY TRUST ME I'M SOBER AND SENSIBLE ENOUGH FOR ANYONE'S CONFIDANTE NOW SO YOU ARE MY DEAR AND I SHOULD HAVE MADE YOU MINE ONLY I FANCIED IT MIGHT PAIN YOU TO LEARN THAT YOUR TEDDY LOVED SOMEONE ELSE
AND HOLDING THE LITTLE PAPER FAST AS IF IT WERE A PROMISE YET TO BE FULFILLED JO LAID HER HEAD DOWN ON A COMFORTABLE RAG BAG AND CRIED AS IF IN OPPOSITION TO THE RAIN PATTERING ON THE ROOF
COME HERE AMY AND DO THE FAINTING SCENE FOR YOU ARE AS STIFF AS A POKER IN THAT I CAN'T HELP IT I NEVER SAW ANYONE FAINT AND I DON'T CHOOSE TO MAKE MYSELF ALL BLACK AND BLUE TUMBLING FLAT AS YOU DO IF I CAN GO DOWN EASILY I'LL DROP IF I CAN'T I SHALL FALL INTO A CHAIR AND BE GRACEFUL
HOW DEVOTED BROOKE HAD BEEN AND HOW HE WAS ALTOGETHER A MOST ESTIMABLE AND UPRIGHT YOUNG MAN WHY MISTER MARCH PAUSED A MINUTE JUST THERE AND AFTER A GLANCE AT MEG WHO WAS VIOLENTLY POKING THE FIRE
DURING ONE OF THE BRIEF CALLS HE MADE HE ARTFULLY LED THE CONVERSATION TO MUSIC AND TALKED AWAY ABOUT GREAT SINGERS WHOM HE HAD SEEN FINE ORGANS HE HAD HEARD
SO MUCH ASTONISHED THAT HE FORGOT HIS OWN SUFFERINGS AND TO SATISFY THE BIRD HE TOOK A SECOND ORANGE AND OPENED IT WITHOUT THINKING WHAT HE WAS DOING OUT OF IT FLEW ANOTHER CANARY AND SHE TOO BEGAN TO CRY I AM DYING OF THIRST GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK
AND TOLD HIS FATHER HE DID NOT WISH TO MARRY INSTEAD OF CHATTING WITH THEM IN THE DUSK HE WANDERED ABOUT THE WOODS WHISPERING TO THE MOON NO WONDER THE YOUNG LADIES THOUGHT HIM VERY ODD BUT THEY LIKED HIM ALL THE BETTER FOR THAT
I DO NOT WISH TO COMPLAIN ONLY I BEG OF YOU DO NOT MAKE ME MARRY AT ALL I HAD RATHER BE THE UNHAPPY PRINCESS CABBAGE STALK ALL MY LIFE THAN INFLICT THE SIGHT OF MY UGLINESS ON ANYONE ELSE
ONCE OUTSIDE THE YOUNG ADVENTURER PUT HIS ORANGES INTO A BAG THAT HUNG FROM HIS SADDLE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE QUICKLY OUT OF THE FOREST NOW AS HE WAS LONGING TO SEE THE PRINCESSES HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO COME TO A RIVER OR A FOUNTAIN
AND PRINCE CURLICUE BEGAN TO COMPREHEND THAT SHE WAS UNDER AN ENCHANTMENT AND THAT IT WAS THE HAND OF HER LOVER THAT HE HAD FOUND AT THIS MOMENT A HUGE EAGLE FLEW INTO THE ROOM HOLDING IN ITS TALONS A GOLDEN BRANCH UPON WHICH WERE GROWING WHAT LOOKED LIKE CLUSTERS OF CHERRIES
HAD STRUCK SO VIOLENTLY AGAINST THE WALL OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT HE FELL BACKWARDS AT THE MOMENT IT CLOSED UPON HIS COMRADES AT THIS STORY THE PARENTS REDOUBLED THEIR LAMENTATIONS THEY RAN WITH PIKES AND MATTOCKS TO THE MOUNTAIN AND SEARCHED TILL EVENING
SO AS TO ESCAPE FROM THE WICKED WITCH BUT ZIZI WISHED TO KNOW WHERE HE MEANT TO TAKE HER TO MY FATHER'S CASTLE HE SAID HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND TOOK HER IN FRONT OF HIM AND HOLDING HER CAREFULLY IN HIS ARMS THEY BEGAN THEIR JOURNEY
THE FEAST WAS EXCELLENT BUT DESIRE HARDLY TOUCHED ANYTHING HOWEVER TO MAKE UP THE OTHER GUESTS ATE GREEDILY AND AS FOR TUBBY NOTHING EVER TOOK AWAY HIS APPETITE WHEN THE MOMENT ARRIVED TO SERVE THE ROAST GOOSE
AND HIS BROTHERS BEGAN TO HAUL IT UP AND WHEN THEY HAD HAULED IT UP AND HAD SET EYES ON THE WONDROUS MAIDENS THEY WENT ASIDE AND SAID LET'S LOWER THE ROPE PULL OUR BROTHER PART OF THE WAY UP AND THEN CUT THE ROPE
AND TOOK THE ROAD HE POINTED OUT IN LESS THAN AN HOUR HE ARRIVED AT THE WALL WHICH WAS VERY HIGH INDEED HE SPRANG TO THE GROUND FASTENED HIS HORSE TO A TREE AND SOON FOUND THE IRON GATE
AND THIS IS WHY TO DAY THE COUNTRY BOYS ALWAYS THROW STONES AT A TITMOUSE ON THE EVENING OF THE WEDDING DAY ALL THE LARDERS CELLARS CUPBOARDS AND TABLES OF THE PEOPLE WHETHER RICH OR POOR WERE LOADED AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT WITH BREAD WINE
IS GONE LIKE A LETTER INTO THE POST AND DRAKESTAIL IS OFF AGAIN ALL SPRUCE AND FRESH STILL SINGING QUACK QUACK QUACK WHEN SHALL I HAVE MY MONEY BACK HE HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN HE MET HIS LADY FRIEND LADDER
I SHALL HAVE DESPATCHED ALL THE RATS IN HAMEL IF YOU WILL BUT PAY ME A GROS A HEAD A GROS A HEAD CRIED THE CITIZENS BUT THAT WILL COME TO MILLIONS OF FLORINS THE TOWN COUNSELLOR SIMPLY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID TO THE STRANGER
WELL WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THE PITCHER MAY GO MANY TIMES TO THE WELL BUT AT LAST IT IS BROKEN WELL HERE IS A BUCKET THAT WILL NOT BREAK
IT WAS THE KING OF THE BAND ARE THEY ALL THERE FRIEND BLANCHET ASKED THE BAGPIPER THEY ARE ALL THERE REPLIED FRIEND BLANCHET AND HOW MANY WERE THEY NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE
HE WAS LOOKING SO CAREFULLY FOR THE PLACE WHERE THE SUN SHONE MOST BRIGHTLY AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT WAS UPON THE PORTRAIT OF A MOST SPLENDIDLY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN HE WENT UP AND EXAMINED IT AND FOUND THAT IT RESTED AGAINST THE EBONY AND GOLD PANELLING
NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE AT ONE GROS A HEAD RECKON LET US RECKON THE HEADS FIRST ONE GROS A HEAD IS ONE HEAD THE GROS WHERE ARE THE HEADS
GOOD MORNING MY FINE COOK SHE SAID IN A SILVERY VOICE TO THE MAN WHO WAS WATCHING THE ROAST GOOD MORNING LOVELY GOLDEN BIRD REPLIED THE CHIEF OF THE SCULLIONS WHO HAD BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP I PRAY THAT HEAVEN MAY SEND YOU TO SLEEP SAID THE GOLDEN BIRD
BUT GO ROUND IT AND ENTER THE ORANGE GROVE THEN GATHER THREE ORANGES AND GET BACK TO THE GATE AS FAST AS YOU CAN ONCE OUT OF THE GATE LEAVE THE FOREST BY THE OPPOSITE SIDE NOW ATTEND TO THIS WHATEVER HAPPENS
THE RATS TOOK THE LEAP SWAM STRAIGHT TO THE FUNNEL PLUNGED IN HEAD FOREMOST AND DISAPPEARED THE PLUNGING CONTINUED THUS WITHOUT CEASING TILL MIDNIGHT AT LAST DRAGGING HIMSELF WITH DIFFICULTY CAME A BIG RAT
WHOSE GREAT ESTATES JOINED HIS OWN FOR HE THOUGHT THAT THIS ALLIANCE WOULD MAKE HIM MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER AND AS FOR THE PRINCESS SHE WOULD DO VERY WELL FOR PRINCE CURLICUE FOR SHE WAS AS UGLY AS HIMSELF INDEED THOUGH SHE WAS THE MOST AMIABLE CREATURE IN THE WORLD
I WILL SAYS HE BUT WITH YOUR BATTALION TO DRAG ALONG YOU WILL SOON BE TIRED MAKE YOURSELF QUITE SMALL GO INTO MY THROAT GET INTO MY GIZZARD AND I WILL CARRY YOU
AND TURNED TO GO BACK TO THE GATE BUT JUST AT THIS MOMENT THE SUN WAS DARKENED
THOU SHALT BE MY GRANDMOTHER IF MIDDLE AGED MY MOTHER AND IF A GIRL THOU SHALT BE MY OWN SISTER THEREUPON HE CAME FORTH AND WHEN SHE SAW HIM SHE WAS DELIGHTED WITH HIM AND SAID
INTO EACH OF THESE HE ENTERED TOOK THE MAIDENS ROBES WENT OUT AGAIN TURNED THE PALACES BACK INTO EGGS AND WENT HOME AND WHEN HE GOT THERE HE HUNG UP THE ROBES ON THE WALL AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP
HE HAD NOT GONE FAR WHEN HE MET FRIEND FOX ON HIS ROUNDS THAT WAY GOOD MORNING NEIGHBOUR SAYS THE FRIEND WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO SO EARLY I AM GOING TO THE KING FOR WHAT HE OWES ME OH TAKE ME WITH THEE
AND WHEN HE HAD EATEN IT HE AGAIN OPENED HIS BOOK BUT COULD SEE NONE OF THE WONDERFUL PICTURES WHICH CONVINCED HIM THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREAMING BEFORE HOWEVER
BUT WHEN HE HEARD DRAKESTAIL SINGING AGAIN
NEITHER CATS NOR DOGS NOR POISON NOR TRAPS NOR PRAYERS NOR CANDLES BURNT TO ALL THE SAINTS NOTHING WOULD DO ANYTHING THE MORE THEY KILLED THE MORE CAME AND THE INHABITANTS OF HAMEL BEGAN TO GO TO THE DOGS
THE NEXT THING TO DO WAS TO FIND THE CABINET AND THE PRINCE SOON CAME TO IT HIDDEN AWAY IN A DARK CORNER THOUGH INDEED IT WAS SO OLD AND BATTERED LOOKING THAT HE WOULD NEVER HAVE NOTICED IT OF HIS OWN ACCORD AT FIRST HE COULD NOT SEE ANY KEYHOLE BUT AFTER A CAREFUL SEARCH HE FOUND ONE HIDDEN IN THE CARVING
WHO HAS WRAPPED UP MY NESTLINGS AND PRESENTLY SEEING THE PRINCE SHE ADDED DIDST THOU DO THAT THANKS IN RETURN ASK OF ME ANYTHING THOU DESIREST
WHERE DWELLS A HORRIBLE WITCH WHO ALLOWS NO LIVING BEING TO ENTER THE DOORS BEHIND THE CASTLE IS THE ORANGE GROVE FOLLOW THE WALL TILL YOU COME TO A HEAVY IRON GATE DON'T TRY TO PRESS IT OPEN BUT OIL THE HINGES WITH THIS
THE NOISE HE MADE BROUGHT HIS GUARDS TO HIS AID AND AS SOON AS HE REVIVED THEY ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS SO FAINT AND GIDDY WITH HUNGER THAT HE HAD IMAGINED HE SAW AND HEARD ALL SORTS OF STRANGE THINGS THEREUPON IN SPITE OF THE KING'S ORDERS THE GUARDS GAVE HIM AN EXCELLENT SUPPER
HE JUMPED LIGHTLY ON HIS HORSE AND WAS A MILE FROM HOME BEFORE TUBBY HAD CEASED LAUGHING A YELLOW WIFE HE MUST BE MAD FIT FOR A STRAIT WAISTCOAT CRIED THE GOOD MAN WHEN HE WAS ABLE TO SPEAK HERE QUICK BRING HIM BACK TO ME
HE FOUND THAT THE PICTURES SEEMED TO BE SCENES FROM THE LIFE OF A MAN WHO APPEARED IN EVERY WINDOW AND THE PRINCE FANCYING THAT HE SAW IN THIS MAN SOME RESEMBLANCE TO HIMSELF BEGAN TO BE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE FIRST WINDOW THERE WAS A PICTURE OF HIM IN ONE OF THE TURRETS OF THE TOWER
HE WAS HORRIFIED AND GAVE ORDERS TO PLUCK ANOTHER GOOSE TO STUFF IT WITH CHESTNUTS AND PUT IT ON THE SPIT WHILE IT WAS BROWNING AT THE FIRE TUBBY INQUIRED FOR HIS GOOSE A SECOND TIME THE MASTER COOK HIMSELF MOUNTED TO THE HALL TO MAKE HIS EXCUSES
I CANNOT EXPLAIN MORE AT PRESENT BUT IS THERE NOTHING YOU WISH FOR YOURSELF MADAM CRIED THE PRINCE FLINGING HIMSELF DOWN AT HER FEET ONLY LOOK AT MY UGLINESS I AM CALLED CURLICUE AND AM AN OBJECT OF DERISION I ENTREAT YOU TO MAKE ME LESS RIDICULOUS
DEAR DEAR SHE SAID TO HERSELF SO HE LIKES YELLOW WOMEN WHY I AM YELLOW TOO AND IF I COULD ONLY THINK OF A WAY IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE SHE DID THINK OF IT
SCORCHING IN THE SUN HERE HE WAS SEIZED WITH DREADFUL THIRST HE TOOK HIS GOURD AND RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS BUT THE GOURD WAS EMPTY IN THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS JOY HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO FILL IT HE RODE ON STRUGGLING WITH HIS SUFFERINGS
THEY NEVER SUSPECTED THE TERRIBLE SURPRISE THAT AWAITED THEM ON THEIR RETURN HOME NO CHILDREN ANYWHERE THEY HAD ALL DISAPPEARED OUR CHILDREN WHERE ARE OUR POOR CHILDREN WAS THE CRY THAT WAS SOON HEARD IN ALL THE STREETS
NONE OF THE GIRLS OF MY OWN COUNTRY ARE BEAUTIFUL IN MY EYES AND THAT IS WHY I CAME TO LOOK FOR A WIFE IN THE LAND OF THE SUN WAS I WRONG MY LOVELY ZIZI THIS TIME IT WAS ZIZI'S TURN TO BE SILENT
AND WHEN HE SOFTLY ADVANCED FEARING TO WAKE HER HE COULD HEAR HER SIGH AND MURMUR TO HERSELF AH HOW DARED YOU THINK TO WIN MY LOVE BY SEPARATING ME FROM MY BELOVED FLORIMOND
AND THE POULTRY WOMAN CAME TO TELL HIM WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON IN THE YARD HE WAS TERRIBLY ANNOYED
THERE CAME FLYING A BIRD SUCH A BIG ONE THAT THE LIGHT WAS BLOTTED OUT BY IT IT HAD BEEN DARK THERE BEFORE BUT NOW IT BECAME DARKER STILL NOW THIS WAS THE MOTHER OF THOSE SMALL BIRDS WHICH THE PRINCE HAD COVERED UP
THERE SLEPT THE NORKA ON A STONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEA AND WHEN IT SNORED THE WATER WAS AGITATED FOR SEVEN MILES AROUND THE PRINCE CROSSED HIMSELF WENT UP TO IT AND SMOTE IT ON THE HEAD WITH HIS SWORD THE HEAD JUMPED OFF SAYING THE WHILE
MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN CAN BE IMAGINED ANYWHERE BUT IN A FAIRY TALE WHO SAID THOU WHO ART IN MY HOUSE NAME THYSELF IF THOU ART AN OLD MAN THOU SHALT BE MY FATHER IF A MIDDLE AGED MAN MY BROTHER
ATTRACTED BY THE MAGIC SOUNDS AND HAD RUSHED TO THE GREAT MARKET PLACE THERE THEY FOUND THE RATCATCHER PLAYING HIS BAGPIPES AT THE SAME SPOT AS THE EVENING BEFORE THEN THE STRANGER HAD BEGUN TO WALK QUICKLY AND THEY HAD FOLLOWED RUNNING SINGING AND DANCING TO THE SOUND OF THE MUSIC
THE PRINCE GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND ASKED LEAVE TO REST COME IN MY YOUNG FRIEND SAID THE OLD MAN MY HOUSE IS NOT LARGE BUT IT IS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD A STRANGER THE TRAVELLER ENTERED AND HIS HOST PUT BEFORE HIM A SIMPLE MEAL
WHICH THE GREAT DOG INSTANTLY SNAPPED UP AND THE YOUNG PRINCE PASSED QUIETLY ON A FEW YARDS FURTHER HE SAW A HUGE OVEN WITH A WIDE RED HOT GAPING MOUTH A WOMAN AS TALL AS A GIANT WAS LEANING OVER THE OVEN
ON HER SIDE SHE SEEMED QUITE BEWILDERED BUT SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER WITH HAPPY EYES AND WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID OF HER DELIVERER HE ASKED HER NAME SHE ANSWERED
WHEREFORE O PRINCE IVAN MY HUSBAND DEAR SHALT THOU BE WHEREFORE HAST THOU COME HITHER THEN HE TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND SHE SAID THAT BEAST WHICH THOU WISHEST TO OVERCOME IS MY BROTHER
NO SOONER DID ZIZI FEEL THE PRICK OF THE PIN THAN SHE BECAME A BIRD AGAIN AND SPREADING HER WINGS SHE FLEW AWAY THAT WAS NEATLY DONE SAID THE GYPSY THE PRINCE WILL BE CLEVER IF HE FINDS HIS BRIDE AND ARRANGING HER DRESS
WHEN THEY WERE ABOUT FOUR STONE THROWS FROM THE GATES THEY DISMOUNTED IN THE FOREST BY THE EDGE OF A FOUNTAIN MY DEAR ZIZI SAID TUBBY'S SON WE CANNOT PRESENT OURSELVES BEFORE MY FATHER LIKE TWO COMMON PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME BACK FROM A WALK WE MUST ENTER THE CASTLE WITH MORE CEREMONY
HAVING HANDED OVER THE CLOTHES WENT HOME BUT HE NO LONGER FOUND HIS DEAR JOURNEYMAN THERE FOR THE PRINCE HAD GONE TO A SHOEMAKER'S AND HIM TOO HE SENT TO WORK FOR THE KING AND IN THE SAME WAY HE WENT THE ROUND OF ALL THE ARTIFICERS
WHY SHOULD I LAUGH ASKED THE OLD MAN MADNESS IN YOUTH IS TRUE WISDOM GO YOUNG MAN FOLLOW YOUR DREAM
YOU WILL SEE A BAKING WOMAN LEANING OVER HER HEATED OVEN GIVE HER THIS BRUSH LASTLY YOU WILL FIND A WELL ON YOUR LEFT DO NOT FORGET TO TAKE THE CORD OF THE BUCKET AND SPREAD IT IN THE SUN WHEN YOU HAVE DONE THIS DO NOT ENTER THE CASTLE
AND THEN THE PRINCE TOOK LEAVE OF HER AND WENT ON TO THE SECOND SISTER THE ONE WHO LIVED IN THE SILVER PALACE AND WITH HER ALSO HE STAYED AWHILE SHE TOLD HIM THAT HER BROTHER NORKA WAS THEN AT HER YOUNGEST SISTER'S
AND RETREATS OF THE TOWN SOON FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CELLARS THE TOP OF THE GARRETS FROM UNDER ALL THE FURNITURE FROM ALL THE NOOKS AND CORNERS OF THE HOUSES
WHY IT MUST BE MINE HOW IN THE WORLD CAN THEY CALL ME UGLY I AM CERTAINLY MUCH TOO PRETTY TO BE THEIR WATER CARRIER SO SAYING SHE BROKE HER PITCHER AND WENT HOME WHERE IS YOUR PITCHER ASKED THE BRICKLAYER
HE STRIKES WITH THE KNOCKER TOC TOC WHO IS THERE ASKS THE PORTER PUTTING HIS HEAD OUT OF THE WICKET TIS I DRAKESTAIL I WISH TO SPEAK TO THE KING SPEAK TO THE KING
THE BIRD APPEARED A THIRD TIME AND SAID GOOD MORNING MY FINE COOK GOOD MORNING LOVELY GOLDEN BIRD REPLIED THE COOK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED AND AT THE MOMENT THAT THE CANARY WAS BEGINNING I PRAY HEAVEN THAT IT MAY SEND
HE WENT HOME AND THE PRINCE SAID TO HIM NOW THEN
HEARD HIM AGAIN RECLAIMING HIS MONEY HE BECAME LIVID WITH RAGE HE COMMANDED THAT THE FURNACE SHOULD BE HEATED AND THIS TAIL OF A DRAKE THROWN INTO IT BECAUSE HE MUST BE A SORCERER THE FURNACE WAS SOON HOT
YOU REFUSE TO HOLD TO THE TERMS OF YOUR AGREEMENT WE OURSELVES COULD REFUSE YOU ALL PAYMENT
WHEN HIS HUNGER WAS SATISFIED THE OLD MAN SAID TO HIM IF I DO NOT MISTAKE YOU COME FROM FAR MAY I ASK WHERE YOU ARE GOING
TRANSYLVANIA WHERE THE INHABITANTS ONLY SPOKE GERMAN WHILE ALL AROUND THEM NOTHING WAS SPOKEN BUT HUNGARIAN THESE PEOPLE ALSO DECLARED THAT THEY CAME FROM GERMANY BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW THEY CHANCED TO BE IN THIS STRANGE COUNTRY
AND THAT THE GOOSE MAY BURN SO THAT THERE MAY BE NONE LEFT FOR TITTY AND THE SCULLION FELL FAST ASLEEP AND WHEN THE MASTER COOK CAME BACK HE FOUND THE GOOSE AS BLACK AS THE CHIMNEY IN A FURY HE WOKE THE SCULLION WHO IN ORDER TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM BLAME TOLD THE WHOLE STORY
THE KING WHO WAS VERY MUCH ANNOYED TO SEE HOW GREATLY SHE DISLIKED IT TOOK A MIRROR AND HOLDING IT UP BEFORE THE UNHAPPY PRINCESS SAID I SEE YOU DO NOT THINK THE PRINCE HANDSOME BUT LOOK AT YOURSELF AND SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY RIGHT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT SIRE SHE ANSWERED
OF AMBER OR OF SOME PRECIOUS STONE AND WAS QUITE FULL OF EVERY KIND OF TREASURE PRINCE CURLICUE WAS DELIGHTED HE OPENED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
GO TO THE KING MASTER AND TELL HIM THAT YOU WILL PROVIDE EVERYTHING THAT'S IN YOUR LINE HOWEVER CAN I UNDERTAKE TO MAKE CLOTHES OF THAT SORT I WORK FOR QUITE COMMON FOLKS SAYS HIS MASTER GO ALONG MASTER
I WILL SAYS HE BUT YOU WHO SLEEP WHILE YOU WALK WILL SOON BE TIRED MAKE YOURSELF QUITE SMALL GET INTO MY THROAT GO INTO MY GIZZARD AND I WILL CARRY YOU
HAPPY THOUGHT SAYS MY FRIEND LADDER
HE HAD THE STRENGTH TO LIFT HIMSELF UP AND PUT HIS HAND INTO HIS BAG HE DREW OUT AN ORANGE AND OPENED IT WITH HIS KNIFE OUT OF IT FLEW THE PRETTIEST LITTLE FEMALE CANARY THAT EVER WAS SEEN GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK I AM DYING OF THIRST SAID THE GOLDEN BIRD
DRAKESTAIL DRAKESTAIL WAS VERY LITTLE THAT IS WHY HE WAS CALLED DRAKESTAIL BUT TINY AS HE WAS HE HAD BRAINS AND HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT FOR HAVING BEGUN WITH NOTHING HE ENDED BY AMASSING A HUNDRED CROWNS
AND I TELL YOU ONCE FOR ALL THAT I WILL NEVER MARRY UNTIL I HAVE FOUND ONE EXACTLY TO MY TASTE TWO SOME TIME AFTERWARDS IT HAPPENED THAT THE PRIOR OF THE ABBEY OF SAINT AMAND
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED A KING AND QUEEN THEY HAD THREE SONS TWO OF THEM WITH THEIR WITS ABOUT THEM BUT THE THIRD A SIMPLETON NOW THE KING HAD A DEER PARK IN WHICH WERE QUANTITIES OF WILD ANIMALS OF DIFFERENT KINDS
AND THEY HANDED OVER THE EGGS TO HIM AND THEN THEY ALL WENT TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH THEY HAD TO BE HOISTED INTO THE UPPER WORLD AND WHEN THEY CAME TO WHERE THE ROPE WAS THE PRINCE TOOK HOLD OF IT AND MADE THE MAIDENS FAST TO IT
PRESENTLY HE CAME UP WITH THE BEAST AND THEY BEGAN A FIGHT THEY FOUGHT AND FOUGHT THE PRINCE GAVE THE BEAST THREE WOUNDS AT LAST THEY WERE BOTH UTTERLY EXHAUSTED SO THEY LAY DOWN TO TAKE A SHORT REST
WHO CERTAINLY MUST HAVE COME OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE YOU LOVELY CREATURE SHE SAID TO ZIZI I AM WAITING FOR MY LOVER ZIZI REPLIED AND THEN WITH A SIMPLICITY QUITE NATURAL IN A GIRL WHO SO LATELY HAD BEEN A CANARY SHE TOLD ALL HER STORY
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE EVENT WHEN THERE WAS NO LONGER ONE LEFT OF THE
BUT SHE HAS BEEN BEWITCHED BY A WICKED SORCERESS AND WILL NOT REGAIN HER BEAUTY UNTIL SHE IS MY WIFE DOES SHE SAY SO WELL IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY DRINK COLD WATER AND THINK IT BACON THE UNHAPPY TUBBY ANSWERED CROSSLY
BUT AT LAST HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER HE LET HIMSELF SLIDE TO THE EARTH AND LAY DOWN BESIDE HIS HORSE HIS THROAT BURNING HIS CHEST HEAVING AND HIS HEAD GOING ROUND ALREADY
THE TOWN COUNSELLOR WHO WAS CONSIDERED CLEVER REASSURED THEM HE SAID SORCERER OR NO IF THIS BAGPIPER SPEAKS THE TRUTH IT WAS HE WHO SENT US THIS HORRIBLE VERMIN
THEN HE TOOK OUT HIS BOTTLE AND OILED THE HINGES WHEN THE GATE OPENED OF ITSELF AND HE SAW AN OLD CASTLE STANDING INSIDE THE PRINCE ENTERED BOLDLY INTO THE COURTYARD SUDDENLY HE HEARD FIERCE HOWLS AND A DOG AS TALL AS A DONKEY
THE GOLDEN BIRD CAME AGAIN TO PERCH ON THE WINDOW SILL AND CALLED IN HIS CLEAR VOICE TO THE HEAD SCULLION WHO WAS WATCHING THE SPIT GOOD MORNING MY FINE SCULLION GOOD MORNING LOVELY GOLDEN BIRD REPLIED THE SCULLION WHOM THE MASTER COOK HAD FORGOTTEN IN HIS EXCITEMENT TO WARN
BUT ALL THE SAME AS HE ADORED HIS SON HE GAVE THE GYPSY HIS HAND AND LED HER TO THE GREAT HALL WHERE THE BRIDAL FEAST WAS SPREAD
BUT THE EAGLE UTTERING A DOLOROUS CRY FLUTTERED HIS BROAD WINGS AND DISAPPEARED THEN THE LADY TURNED TO PRINCE CURLICUE AND SAID
AND ORDERED THAT HE SHOULD BE IMPRISONED IN THE TOWER THAT WAS KEPT ON PURPOSE FOR REBELLIOUS PRINCES BUT HAD NOT BEEN USED FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS BECAUSE THERE HAD NOT BEEN ANY THE PRINCE THOUGHT ALL THE ROOMS LOOKED STRANGELY OLD FASHIONED WITH THEIR ANTIQUE FURNITURE BUT AS THERE WAS A GOOD LIBRARY HE WAS PLEASED
IN THEIR POCKETS AND IN THEIR BOOTS AND WHEN THEY WANTED A MORSEL TO EAT THE VORACIOUS HORDE HAD SWEPT AWAY EVERYTHING FROM CELLAR TO GARRET THE NIGHT WAS EVEN WORSE AS SOON AS THE LIGHTS WERE OUT THESE UNTIRING NIBBLERS SET TO WORK
AND IF YOU WISH TO HELP ME GO WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY TO THE GREAT GALLERY NOTICE WHERE THE SUN'S RAYS FALL MOST BRIGHTLY AND IF YOU SEEK THERE YOU WILL FIND MY TREASURE THE VOICE CEASED AND THOUGH THE PRINCE IN HIS BEWILDERMENT ASKED VARIOUS QUESTIONS HE RECEIVED NO ANSWER
I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR THEE THEN CARRY ME INTO THE OTHER WORLD HE REPLIED MAKE ME A LARGE VESSEL WITH A PARTITION IN THE MIDDLE SHE SAID CATCH ALL SORTS OF GAME
TITTY WENT OFF RUBBING HER SIDES BUT THIS TIME SHE DID NOT DARE TO DISOBEY AND IN A VERY BAD TEMPER STOOPED DOWN OVER THE WELL IT WAS NOT AT ALL EASY TO FILL THE MILK CAN WHICH WAS LARGE AND ROUND IT WOULD NOT GO DOWN INTO THE WELL
AND STOOD BY TITTY THE GYPSY BEGAN TO COMB HER LONG BROWN LOCKS WHEN SUDDENLY SHE DREW A PIN FROM HER STAYS AND JUST AS THE TITMOUSE DIGS ITS BEAK INTO THE HEADS OF LINNETS AND LARKS TITTY DUG THE PIN INTO THE HEAD OF ZIZI
THEN HE BECAME SO DIVERTED AT THE NOTION OF HIS SON MARRYING A YELLOW WOMAN AND A WOMAN SHUT UP INSIDE AN ORANGE THAT HE BURST INTO FITS OF LAUGHTER
NOW SAID THE MERCHANTS OF BREMEN THESE GERMANS CANNOT BE OTHER THAN THE DESCENDANTS OF THE LOST CHILDREN OF HAMEL THE PEOPLE OF HAMEL DID NOT DOUBT IT AND SINCE THAT DAY THEY REGARD IT AS CERTAIN THAT THE TRANSYLVANIANS OF HUNGARY
AND GET REPAID SO ONE FINE MORNING DRAKESTAIL VERY SPRUCE AND FRESH TAKES THE ROAD SINGING QUACK QUACK QUACK WHEN SHALL I GET MY MONEY BACK
THOUGH TO TELL THE TRUTH HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ADMIRE THE PRINCE'S PORTRAIT WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM HOWEVER HE HAD IT PLACED IN AS FAVOURABLE A LIGHT AS POSSIBLE AND SENT FOR THE PRINCESS BUT THE MOMENT SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF IT SHE LOOKED THE OTHER WAY AND BEGAN TO CRY
DRAKESTAIL SAID TO HIMSELF ONE CAN'T HAVE TOO MANY FRIENDS I WILL SAYS HE
AS SHE WAS ALWAYS BEING TEASED ABOUT HER COMPLEXION SHE GOT AS NOISY AND CROSS AS A TITMOUSE SO THEY USED TO CALL HER TITTY TITTY WAS OFTEN SENT BY THE BRICKLAYER TO FETCH WATER FROM THE FOUNTAIN AND AS SHE WAS VERY PROUD AND LAZY
WITH THE INTENTION OF TAKING THEM OUT INTO THE UPPER WORLD FOR THEY ALL LOVED HIM AND WOULD NOT BE SEPARATED FROM HIM EACH OF THEM TURNED HER PALACE INTO AN EGG FOR THEY WERE ALL ENCHANTRESSES AND THEY TAUGHT HIM HOW TO TURN THE EGGS INTO PALACES AND BACK AGAIN
HAPPILY HE REMEMBERED THAT THERE WAS STILL ONE REMAINING FRIEND AND HE CRIED WITH DYING ACCENTS WASP'S NEST WASP'S NEST MAKE A SALLY
HE HAS STRETCHED ME OUT IN THE SUN LET HIM GO IN PEACE DOG MY GOOD DOG CRIED THE VOICE MORE AND MORE ANGRY JUMP AT HIS THROAT AND EAT HIM UP NO REPLIED THE DOG THOUGH I HAVE SERVED YOU LONG
YOU NEVER GAVE ME ANY BREAD HE HAS GIVEN ME AS MUCH AS I WANT LET HIM GO IN PEACE IRON GATE IRON GATE CRIED THE VOICE GROWLING LIKE THUNDER FALL ON HIM AND GRIND HIM TO POWDER NO REPLIED THE GATE
AND THE GYPSY HAD TO TRY AGAIN AND AGAIN AT LAST HER ARMS GREW SO TIRED THAT WHEN SHE DID MANAGE TO GET THE CAN PROPERLY UNDER THE WATER SHE HAD NO STRENGTH TO PULL IT UP AND IT ROLLED TO THE BOTTOM ON SEEING THE CAN DISAPPEAR
THERE ARRIVED ONE EVENING IN HAMEL SOME MERCHANTS OF BREMEN RETURNING FROM THE EAST WHO ASKED TO SPEAK WITH THE CITIZENS THEY TOLD THAT THEY IN CROSSING HUNGARY
AND IT SAID TO HIM HAIL PRINCE IVAN LONG HAVE I AWAITED THEE HE MOUNTED THE HORSE AND RODE ON RODE AND RODE UNTIL HE SAW STANDING BEFORE HIM A PALACE MADE OF COPPER HE ENTERED THE COURTYARD TIED UP HIS HORSE
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU HIS FATHER OFTEN SAID TO HIM YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU CAN POSSIBLY WISH FOR A GOOD BED GOOD FOOD AND TUNS FULL OF BEER THE ONLY THING YOU WANT IN ORDER TO BECOME AS FAT AS A PIG
THEN HE WENT ON TO THE WELL DREW UP THE CORD WHICH WAS HALF ROTTEN AND STRETCHED IT OUT IN THE SUN LASTLY HE WENT ROUND THE CASTLE AND PLUNGED INTO THE ORANGE GROVE THERE HE GATHERED THE THREE MOST BEAUTIFUL ORANGES HE COULD FIND
COARSE HAIR AND A SKIN NOT GOLDEN LIKE THAT OF ZIZI
THE WOOD THAT YOU SAW IN YOUR DREAM IS NOT FAR FROM HERE SAID THE OLD MAN IT IS IN THE DEPTH OF THE FOREST AND THIS ROAD WILL LEAD YOU THERE YOU WILL COME TO A VAST PARK SURROUNDED BY HIGH WALLS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARK IS A CASTLE
TUBBY CAME TO MEET HER AT THE FOOT OF THE GREAT MARBLE STAIRCASE AT THE SIGHT OF THE HIDEOUS CREATURE HE ALMOST FELL BACKWARDS WHAT HE CRIED IS THIS THE WONDERFUL BEAUTY
CRIED KING GRUMPY ANGRILY AND THE PRINCE SEEING THAT IT WAS OF NO USE TO REMONSTRATE BOWED AND RETIRED AS KING GRUMPY WAS NOT USED TO BEING CONTRADICTED IN ANYTHING HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPLEASED WITH HIS SON
THEN TUBBY'S SON SAW HIS FOLLY AND WHILE THE TWO CANARIES FLEW AWAY HE SANK ON THE GROUND WHERE EXHAUSTED BY HIS LAST EFFORT HE LAY UNCONSCIOUS
WOULD SOON GET TIRED OF BEING IN PRISON AND SO CONSENT TO MARRY THE PRINCESS CABBAGE STALK THAT HE SENT AMBASSADORS TO HER FATHER PROPOSING THAT SHE SHOULD COME AND BE MARRIED TO HIS SON WHO WOULD MAKE HER PERFECTLY HAPPY THE KING WAS DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE SO GOOD AN OFFER FOR HIS UNLUCKY DAUGHTER
WHERE ARE WE BOUND FOR SO SPRUCE AND FRESH I AM GOING TO THE KING FOR WHAT HE OWES ME OH TAKE
ALAS OUT OF IT FLEW A LITTLE CANARY JUST LIKE THE OTHERS WHO CRIED I AM THIRSTY GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK
BEHOLD DRAKESTAIL MUCH ASTONISHED ALL ALONE IN THE BIG SALOON AND MASTER OF THE FIELD HE COULD NOT GET OVER IT NEVERTHELESS HE REMEMBERED SHORTLY WHAT HE HAD COME FOR TO THE PALACE AND IMPROVING THE OCCASION
AND TO BEG HIS LORD TO HAVE A LITTLE PATIENCE TUBBY SHOWED HIS PATIENCE BY ABUSING HIS SON AS IF IT WASN'T ENOUGH HE GRUMBLED BETWEEN HIS TEETH THAT THE BOY SHOULD PICK UP A HAG WITHOUT A PENNY BUT THE GOOSE MUST GO AND BURN NOW
YOU WILL SOON BE TIRED MAKE YOURSELF QUITE SMALL GET INTO MY THROAT GO INTO MY GIZZARD AND I WILL CARRY YOU HAPPY THOUGHT SAYS FRIEND FOX HE TAKES BAG AND BAGGAGE AND PRESTO
WITH A BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN LETTER SAYING THAT THESE GOLDEN FRUIT THEN UNKNOWN IN FLANDERS CAME STRAIGHT FROM A LAND WHERE THE SUN ALWAYS SHONE THAT EVENING TUBBY AND HIS SON ATE THE GOLDEN APPLES AT SUPPER AND THOUGHT THEM DELICIOUS
HE FELT THAT DEATH WAS NEAR HIM WHEN HIS EYES FELL ON THE BAG WHERE THE ORANGES PEEPED OUT
WHEN THE SQUARE WAS QUITE FULL THE BAGPIPER FACED ABOUT AND STILL PLAYING BRISKLY TURNED TOWARDS THE RIVER
SEARCH FOR THE DOOR FLING THEMSELVES INTO THE STREET AND TRIP TRIP TRIP BEGIN TO RUN IN FILE TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE TOWN HALL SO SQUEEZED TOGETHER THAT THEY COVERED THE PAVEMENT LIKE THE WAVES OF FLOODED TORRENT
BUT IF A YOUNG MAN THOU SHALT BE MY HUSBAND DEAR AND IF THOU ART A WOMAN
I AM LOST SAID DRAKESTAIL TO HIMSELF WHEN BY GOOD LUCK HE REMEMBERS HIS COMRADE FRIEND FOX AND HE CRIES
WHEN THE ROPE WAS MADE THE PRINCE CALLED FOR HIS BROTHERS AND HE AND THEY HAVING TAKEN SERVANTS WITH THEM AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS NEEDED FOR A WHOLE YEAR SET OUT FOR THE PLACE WHERE THE BEAST HAD DISAPPEARED UNDER THE STONE
WHERE THE TREES WERE COVERED WITH GOLDEN APPLES I GATHERED ONE OF THEM AND WHEN I OPENED IT THERE CAME OUT A LOVELY PRINCESS WITH A GOLDEN SKIN THAT IS THE WIFE I WANT AND I AM GOING TO LOOK FOR HER
NEVER WAS THERE A BEAUTIFUL SOUL IN SUCH A FRIGHTFUL LITTLE BODY BUT IN SPITE OF HIS APPEARANCE EVERYBODY LOVED HIM THE QUEEN HIS MOTHER CALLED HIM CURLICUE BECAUSE IT WAS A NAME SHE RATHER LIKED AND IT SEEMED TO SUIT HIM KING GRUMPY WHO CARED A GREAT DEAL MORE FOR HIS OWN GRANDEUR THAN FOR HIS SON'S HAPPINESS
SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RING WHICH SHE HAD GIVEN TO THE PRINCE IN THE OTHER WORLD AND HER SISTERS RINGS TOO FOR IT REALLY WAS HE
AND THE MOMENT THE MOON ROSE ON THE HORIZON
NOT FAR FROM THE FOUNTAIN THERE LIVED A FAMILY OF BRICKLAYERS NOW FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE THIS TIME THE FATHER IN WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST FOUND A LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD BEEN DESERTED BY THE GYPSIES HE CARRIED HER HOME TO HIS WIFE
AND THE LADIES AT ONCE PUT ON THE FALSE PRINCESS THE RICH DRESSES THEY HAD BROUGHT FOR ZIZI SHE WAS THEN PERCHED ON THE TOP OF A MAGNIFICENT AMBLING PALFREY AND THEY SET FORTH TO THE CASTLE BUT UNLUCKILY THE RICH DRESS AND JEWELS ONLY MADE TITTY LOOK UGLIER STILL
HAPPY THOUGHT SAYS MY FRIEND RIVER SHE TAKES BAG AND BAGGAGE AND GLOU GLOU GLOU SHE TAKES HER PLACE BETWEEN FRIEND FOX AND MY FRIEND LADDER AND QUACK QUACK QUACK DRAKESTAIL IS OFF AGAIN SINGING
BUT BEFORE HE REACHED THE PARK HE WENT INTO A TRAKTIR OR TAVERN AND THERE HE SPENT THE WHOLE NIGHT IN REVELRY WHEN HE CAME TO HIS SENSES IT WAS TOO LATE THE DAY HAD ALREADY DAWNED HE FELT HIMSELF DISGRACED IN THE EYES OF HIS FATHER
AND WHEN THE BIRD HAD COME FLYING UP SHE PERCEIVED THAT HER LITTLE ONES WERE COVERED OVER
AND LEFT FILE HE TAKES THE SAME ROAD TO JOIN THE OTHERS WITH ALL HIS PARTY THERE WAS NOT MUCH MORE ROOM BUT BY CLOSING UP A BIT THEY MANAGED AND DRAKESTAIL IS OFF AGAIN SINGING
AND THAT THE GOOSE MAY BURN SO THAT THERE MAY BE NONE LEFT FOR TITTY AND INSTANTLY THE CHIEF OF THE SCULLIONS FELL FAST ASLEEP AND THE GOOSE WAS BURNT TO A CINDER WHEN HE AWOKE
THAT HE THOUGHT HE MUST NOW BE NEAR THE PLACE OF HIS DREAM HE WAS AT THAT MOMENT CLOSE TO THE CORNER OF A WOOD WHERE STOOD A LITTLE HUT BEFORE THE DOOR OF WHICH HIS HORSE STOPPED OF HIS OWN ACCORD AN OLD MAN WITH A WHITE BEARD WAS SITTING ON THE DOORSTEP ENJOYING THE FRESH AIR
AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY BITTERLY
AND THAT IT WOULD BE A PLEASANT SPECTACLE WHEN THE PEOPLE OF HAMEL HEARD OF THE BARGAIN THEY TOO EXCLAIMED A GROS A HEAD BUT THIS WILL COST US A DEAL OF MONEY LEAVE IT TO THE TOWN COUNSELLOR SAID THE TOWN COUNCIL WITH A MALICIOUS AIR
YOUR EXCELLENCY IT IS THE BIRD REPLIED THE SCULLION AND HE PLACED IT IN HIS HAND
THE PRINCE TOOK THE HINT AND LIFTING ASIDE THE PICTURE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY FOUND HIMSELF IN A MARBLE HALL ADORNED WITH STATUES FROM THIS HE PASSED ON THROUGH NUMBERS OF SPLENDID ROOMS UNTIL AT LAST HE REACHED ONE ALL HUNG WITH BLUE GAUZE
HE SET TO WORK TO HUNT FOR HIS DEAR MONEY BUT IN VAIN HE RUMMAGED IN ALL THE DRAWERS HE FOUND NOTHING ALL HAD BEEN SPENT
AND AGAIN GAVE IT THREE WOUNDS BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN JUST AS THE PRINCE BEGAN CHASING IT FOR THE FOURTH TIME THE BEAST FLED TO A GREAT WHITE STONE TILTED IT UP AND ESCAPED INTO THE OTHER WORLD CRYING OUT TO THE PRINCE
IF YOU DON'T BRING IT BACK FULL YOUR BONES SHALL SUFFER FOR IT
AND FEELING FATIGUED HE SAT HIMSELF DOWN ON IT TO THINK OVER HIS ADVENTURE IN THE MEANWHILE THE PEOPLE HAD FOUND THEIR KING AND HIS MINISTERS WITH THEIR FEET IN THE AIR ON THE PAVEMENT AND THEY HAD GONE INTO THE PALACE TO KNOW HOW IT HAD OCCURRED
AND HE SHALL GO IN PEACE ROPE O ROPE CRIED THE VOICE AGAIN TWINE YOURSELF ROUND HIS NECK AND STRANGLE HIM NO REPLIED THE ROPE YOU HAVE LEFT ME FOR MANY YEARS PAST TO FALL TO PIECES WITH THE DAMP
A BARGAIN TO WORK THE RATS WILL BE PAID ONE GROS A HEAD AS YOU ASK THE BAGPIPER ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPERATE THAT VERY EVENING WHEN THE MOON ROSE HE ADDED THAT THE INHABITANTS
IS A WIFE THAT CAN BRING YOU BROAD RICH LANDS SO MARRY AND YOU WILL BE PERFECTLY HAPPY
DRAKESTAIL WHO WAS NO LONGER SURPRISED AT ANYTHING RECEIVED THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THE PEOPLE AS IF HE HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING ELSE ALL HIS LIFE
TRY TO GIVE US OUR QUEEN AGAIN FOR IF YOU DO YOU WILL BE REWARDED IF NOT IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YOU AT THESE WORDS THE PRINCE WHO HAD BEEN GROWING MORE AND MORE ASTONISHED WAS FAIRLY TERRIFIED AND DROPPING THE BOOK WITH A CRASH HE SANK BACK INSENSIBLE
BEER CAKES AND TARTS ROAST LARKS AND EVEN GEESE SO THAT TUBBY COULD NOT COMPLAIN ANY MORE THAT HIS SON HAD MARRIED FAMINE
BUT TURKEYS AND CHICKENS ARE CREATURES WHO DON'T LIKE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT AS THEMSELVES WHEN THEY SAW THE NEW COMER AND HOW HE WAS MADE AND WHEN THEY HEARD HIM CRYING TOO THEY BEGAN TO LOOK BLACK AT HIM WHAT IS IT WHAT DOES HE WANT
BUT AS SOON AS HE TOUCHED IT AWAY IT FLEW TO A DISTANCE THOUGH IT WAS EVER SO BIG BIG AS A HILL AND WHEN HE HAD FLUNG THE STONE ASIDE HE SPOKE A SECOND TIME TO HIS BROTHERS SAYING WHO IS GOING INTO THE OTHER WORLD TO OVERCOME THE NORKA
SHE WAS ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS OLD AND FOR TEN YEARS OF THAT TIME THE WITCH HAD KEPT HER SHUT UP IN AN ORANGE IN THE SHAPE OF A CANARY WELL THEN MY CHARMING ZIZI SAID THE YOUNG PRINCE WHO WAS LONGING TO MARRY HER LET US RIDE AWAY QUICKLY
IT IS A HUNDRED YEARS SINCE YOU LEFT ME TO RUST AND HE HAS OILED ME LET HIM GO IN PEACE
MY FRIEND LADDER WHO WAS ONLY WAITING FOR THESE WORDS HASTENS OUT LEANS HER TWO ARMS ON THE EDGE OF THE WELL THEN DRAKESTAIL CLIMBS NIMBLY ON HER BACK AND HOP HE IS IN THE YARD WHERE HE BEGINS TO SING LOUDER THAN EVER
AND THIS TIME IT WAS A TALL HANDSOME YOUNG MAN POOR PRINCE CURLICUE FOUND IT A PLEASURE TO LOOK AT HIM HE WAS SO STRAIGHT AND STRONG BY THIS TIME IT HAD GROWN DARK AND THE PRINCE HAD TO GO BACK TO HIS OWN ROOM AND TO AMUSE HIMSELF HE TOOK UP A QUAINT OLD BOOK
WAIT FOR ME HERE AND IN AN HOUR I WILL RETURN WITH CARRIAGES AND HORSES FIT FOR A PRINCESS DON'T BE LONG REPLIED ZIZI AND SHE WATCHED HIM GO WITH WISTFUL EYES WHEN SHE WAS LEFT BY HERSELF THE POOR GIRL BEGAN TO FEEL AFRAID
DO NOT OPEN YOUR ORANGES TILL YOU REACH THE BANK OF A RIVER OR A FOUNTAIN OUT OF EACH ORANGE WILL COME A PRINCESS AND YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH YOU LIKE FOR YOUR WIFE YOUR CHOICE ONCE MADE BE VERY CAREFUL NEVER TO LEAVE YOUR BRIDE FOR AN INSTANT AND REMEMBER
AND IN PASSING THROUGH MOUNTAINS VALLEYS AND TOWNS SHE ASKED A THOUSAND QUESTIONS
WAVING HIS SCEPTRE HE HAD COME TO SEE FOR HIMSELF WHY THE GOOSE HAD NEVER MADE ITS APPEARANCE THE SCULLION STOPPED AT ONCE JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO WRING THE CANARY'S NECK
WHEN THE PRINCESSES SAW THAT THE CLOTHES WERE THOSE WHICH HAD BEEN THEIRS IN THE OTHER WORLD THEY GUESSED THAT PRINCE IVAN WAS IN THIS WORLD SO THEY EXCHANGED GLANCES WITH EACH OTHER BUT THEY HELD THEIR PEACE AND THE MASTER
NEXT MORNING AS THE DAY DAWNED
I PRAY HEAVEN WENT ON THE CANARY
MIDNIGHT SOUNDED THE PRINCE AROSE WENT OUT OF THE CITY INTO THE FIELDS TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET THE EGGS WHICH THE MAIDENS HAD GIVEN HIM AND AS THEY HAD TAUGHT HIM TURNED THEM INTO THREE PALACES
JUST LIKE ANY OF THE OTHER PICTURES IN THE GALLERY HE WAS PUZZLED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO NEXT UNTIL IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO SEE IF THE WINDOWS WOULD HELP HIM AND LOOKING AT THE NEAREST HE SAW A PICTURE OF HIMSELF LIFTING THE PICTURE FROM THE WALL
I BELIEVE THAT THIS MUST OPEN THAT LITTLE GOLDEN DOOR IN THE MIDDLE SAID THE PRINCE TO HIMSELF AND HE FITTED IN THE LITTLE KEY AND TURNED IT THE TINY DOOR SWUNG BACK AND A SOFT CRIMSON LIGHT GLEAMED OVER THE WHOLE CABINET
THEN HE WENT ALL DRESSED FOR A JOURNEY TO THE BEDSIDE OF TUBBY AND FOUND HIM SMOKING HIS FIRST PIPE FATHER HE SAID GRAVELY I HAVE COME TO BID YOU FAREWELL LAST NIGHT I DREAMED THAT I WAS WALKING IN A WOOD
AND HE TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS CRYING MY DARLING ZIZI HOW HAPPY I AM TO SEE YOU ONCE MORE WELL AND THE OTHER ONE ASKED TUBBY THE OTHER ONE WAS STEALING QUIETLY TO THE DOOR STOP HER CALLED TUBBY
WHEN THE HAMEL PEOPLE HEARD HOW THE AFFAIR HAD ENDED THEY RUBBED THEIR HANDS AND WITH NO MORE SCRUPLE THAN THEIR TOWN COUNSELLOR THEY LAUGHED OVER THE RATCATCHER WHO THEY SAID WAS CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP
AND THE GOOD PEOPLE OF HAMEL REPEATED WITH THEIR COUNSELLORS LEAVE IT TO THE TOWN COUNSELLOR
A SCULLION WHO WAS HIDDEN OUTSIDE RUSHED OUT AND SHUT THE SHUTTERS THE BIRD FLEW INTO THE KITCHEN THEN ALL THE COOKS AND SCULLIONS SPRANG AFTER IT KNOCKING AT IT WITH THEIR APRONS AT LENGTH ONE OF THEM CAUGHT IT JUST AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT TUBBY ENTERED THE KITCHEN
IT WILL END BY GETTING ME SENT AWAY COME SOME OF YOU AND HIDE YOURSELVES AND IF IT COMES AGAIN CATCH IT AND WRING ITS NECK HE SPITTED A THIRD GOOSE LIT A HUGE FIRE AND SEATED HIMSELF BY IT
AND THE GOLDEN KEY JUST FITTED IT SO THE PRINCE GAVE IT A VIGOROUS TURN AND THE DOORS FLEW OPEN UGLY AND OLD AS THE CABINET WAS OUTSIDE NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN MORE RICH AND BEAUTIFUL THAN WHAT MET THE PRINCE'S ASTONISHED EYES EVERY DRAWER WAS MADE OF CRYSTAL
AND THE GOOD WOMAN WAS SORRY FOR HER AND BROUGHT HER UP WITH HER OWN SONS AS SHE GREW OLDER THE LITTLE GYPSY BECAME MUCH MORE REMARKABLE FOR STRENGTH AND CUNNING THAN FOR SENSE OR BEAUTY SHE HAD A LOW FOREHEAD A FLAT NOSE THICK LIPS
VERY OLD AND WEAK WHO A FEW DECADES AGO HAD BEEN BOYS AND GIRLS OF THE FRONTIER RIDING BRONCOS THROUGH THE RANK WINDY GRASS OF THIS PRAIRIE THEY HOBBLED BEHIND A BAND MADE UP OF BUSINESS MEN AND HIGH SCHOOL BOYS
THAT'S ALL OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF A LIVING DEAD MAN EXCEPT THE DIVERTING LAST CHAPTER THE LIES ABOUT MY HAVING BEEN A TOWER OF STRENGTH AND LEGAL WISDOM WHICH SOME DAY A PREACHER WILL SPIN OVER MY LEAN DRY BODY
WE CAN'T GET WHOLESOMELY DRUNK AND RELAX WE HAVE TO BE SO CORRECT ABOUT SEX MORALS AND INCONSPICUOUS CLOTHES AND DOING OUR COMMERCIAL TRICKERY ONLY IN THE TRADITIONAL WAYS THAT NONE OF US CAN LIVE UP TO IT AND WE BECOME HORRIBLY HYPOCRITICAL UNAVOIDABLY
THERE WERE ONLY THREE THINGS WHICH SHE COULD DO HAVE CHILDREN START HER CAREER OF REFORMING OR BECOME SO DEFINITELY A PART OF THE TOWN THAT SHE WOULD BE FULFILLED BY THE ACTIVITIES OF CHURCH AND STUDY CLUB AND BRIDGE PARTIES
UNHAPPY WOMEN ARE GIVEN TO PROTECTING THEIR SENSITIVENESS BY CYNICAL GOSSIP BY WHINING BY HIGH CHURCH AND NEW THOUGHT RELIGIONS OR BY A FOG OF VAGUENESS CAROL HAD HIDDEN IN NONE OF THESE REFUGES FROM REALITY
WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ANY TOWN OF ANYWHERES NEAR OUR SIZE IN THE STATE THAT HAS SUCH A STERLING WAR RECORD ANOTHER REASON WHY YOU'D BETTER WATCH GOPHER PRAIRIE GROW
YOU REMEMBER MY SAYING THAT OF COURSE I ALWAYS SHALL PLEASE TRY THIS CHAIR SHE GLANCED ABOUT THE RUSTY OFFICE GAUNT STOVE SHELVES OF TAN LAW BOOKS DESK CHAIR FILLED WITH NEWSPAPERS SO LONG SAT UPON
THAT THEY REDISCOVERED WITH SURPRISE AND A FEELING OF HEROISM THIS ARMOR OF AN ARTIC EXPLORER WINTER GARMENTS SURPASSED EVEN PERSONAL GOSSIP AS THE TOPIC AT PARTIES IT WAS GOOD FORM TO ASK PUT ON YOUR HEAVIES YET
WITH SPURIOUS ENTHUSIASM HE SAID SPLENDID I WILL FROM THE DOOR HE GLANCED AT HER CURLED IN THE PEELED LEATHER CHAIR HE SLIPPED OUT CAME BACK WITH DOCTOR AND MISSUS DILLON
HER COLLAR WHITE WITH FROST FROM HER BREATH SHE BOUGHT A CAN OF TOMATOES AS THOUGH IT WERE ORIENT FRUIT AND RETURNED HOME PLANNING TO SURPRISE KENNICOTT WITH AN OMELET CREOLE FOR DINNER SO BRILLIANT WAS THE SNOW GLARE
I DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF IT CARRIE WHAT THE DEUCE WAS THE NAME OF THAT FIRST STOP WE MADE THE OTHER SIDE OF ALBUQUERQUE WELL ANYWAY I GUESS
A WESTERN MINING SETTLEMENT LIKE A TUMOR A BOOMING SEMI CITY WITH PARKS AND CLEVER ARCHITECTS VISITED BY FAMOUS PIANISTS AND UNCTUOUS LECTURERS BUT IRRITABLE FROM A STRUGGLE BETWEEN UNION LABOR AND THE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
WHAT EDITORIAL DID HE GET THAT FROM SHE WONDERED AS SHE PROTESTED SEE HERE MY BELOVED WHY CAN'T YOU TORIES DECLARE WAR HONESTLY YOU DON'T OPPOSE THIS ORGANIZER BECAUSE YOU THINK HE'S SEDITIOUS
THUS SHE CHANCED TO DISCOVER THAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO
HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON BESIDES THE REPAIRMAN AT SAM CLARK'S WHO UNDERSTOOD PLUMBING EVERYBODY BEGGED HIM TO LOOK OVER THE FURNACE AND THE WATER PIPES HE RUSHED FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE TILL AFTER BEDTIME TEN O'CLOCK
THE LAST THING SHE SAW ON THE STATION PLATFORM WAS KENNICOTT FAITHFULLY WAVING HIS HAND HIS FACE SO FULL OF UNCOMPREHENDING LONELINESS THAT HE COULD NOT SMILE BUT ONLY TWITCH UP HIS LIPS SHE WAVED TO HIM AS LONG AS SHE COULD
KENNICOTT HAD ASSERTED THAT THE VILLAGER'S LACK OF COURTESY IS DUE TO HIS POVERTY WE'RE NO MILLIONAIRE DUDES HE BOASTED YET THESE ARMY AND NAVY MEN THESE BUREAU EXPERTS AND ORGANIZERS OF MULTITUDINOUS LEAGUES
LAMB CHOPS WERE AS EXOTIC AS SHARKS FINS THE MEAT DEALERS SHIPPED THEIR BEST TO THE CITY WITH ITS HIGHER PRICES IN ALL THE SHOPS THERE WAS THE SAME LACK OF CHOICE SHE COULD NOT FIND A GLASS HEADED PICTURE NAIL IN TOWN
SHE OBSERVED AS SHE REFLECTED THAT IN GOPHER PRAIRIE IT IS NOT DECENT TO CALL ON A MAN AS SHE DECIDED THAT NO REALLY SHE WOULDN'T GO IN AND AS SHE WENT IN I DIDN'T KNOW YOUR OFFICE WAS UP HERE
SHE WONDERED IF SHE OUGHT TO BE OFFENDED BY HIS CARESS THEN SHE WONDERED IF HE LIKED HER HAT THE NEW ORIENTAL TURBAN OF ROSE AND SILVER BROCADE HE DROPPED HER HAND HIS ELBOW BRUSHED HER SHOULDER HE FLITTED OVER TO THE DESK CHAIR HIS THIN BACK STOOPED
AS THE TRAIN STRUCK IN AMONG THE HILLS SHE RESOLVED I'M GOING TO LOVE THE FINE WILL KENNICOTT QUALITY THAT THERE IS IN GOPHER PRAIRIE THE NOBILITY OF GOOD SENSE IT WILL BE SWEET TO SEE VIDA AND GUY AND THE CLARKS
MOST TROUBLES ARE UNNECESSARY WE HAVE NATURE BEATEN WE CAN MAKE HER GROW WHEAT WE CAN KEEP WARM WHEN SHE SENDS BLIZZARDS SO WE RAISE THE DEVIL JUST FOR PLEASURE WARS POLITICS RACE HATREDS LABOR DISPUTES
YET MANAGED TO MAKE A VERY COMFORTABLE THING OF IT BY LIVING IN SMALL FLATS AND HAVING TIME TO READ BUT SHE ALSO LEARNED THAT BY COMPARISON GOPHER PRAIRIE WAS A MODEL OF DARING COLOR CLEVER PLANNING AND FRENZIED INTELLECTUALITY
WAIT LL I GET TIME AND I'LL MOVE THE MOUNTAINS HERE ANY MOUNTAIN WILL BE TICKLED TO DEATH TO LOCATE HERE ONCE WE GET THE WHITE WAY IN THE TOWN WELCOMED MISTER BLAUSSER AS FULLY AS CAROL SNUBBED HIM
ALONG THE RAILROAD THE SECTIONS OF SNOW FENCE WHICH HAD BEEN STACKED ALL SUMMER IN ROMANTIC WOODEN TENTS OCCUPIED BY ROVING SMALL BOYS WERE SET UP TO PREVENT DRIFTS FROM COVERING THE TRACK
SHE SPOKE ILL OF HIM AT HOME AND IN PUBLIC PLACES BUT KENNICOTT AND THE OTHER POWERS INSISTED MAYBE HE IS KIND OF A ROUGHNECK
THEY UPSET AND GOT SNOW DOWN THEIR NECKS THEY SHRIEKED THAT THEY WOULD DO IT AGAIN IMMEDIATELY AND THEY DID NOT DO IT AGAIN AT ALL SHE BADGERED ANOTHER GROUP INTO GOING SKIING THEY SHOUTED AND THREW SNOWBALLS
SO THAT AS THEY WAVERED WITH THEIR SUIT CASES THEY SLID AND ALMOST FELL THE WET SNOW DRENCHED THEIR GLOVES THE WATER UNDERFOOT SPLASHED THEIR ITCHING ANKLES THEY SCUFFLED INCH BY INCH FOR THREE BLOCKS IN FRONT OF HARRY HAYDOCK'S KENNICOTT SIGHED
BUT ALSO THE PERFECT SITE FOR FACTORIES SUMMER COTTAGES AND STATE INSTITUTIONS IN CHARGE OF THE CAMPAIGN WAS MISTER JAMES BLAUSSER WHO HAD RECENTLY COME TO TOWN TO SPECULATE IN LAND MISTER BLAUSSER WAS KNOWN AS A HUSTLER
LYMAN CASS GAVE CHAMP A WARM BERTH AS NIGHT WATCHMAN
HE SAW HER WHY HELLO OLD LADY PRETTY DARN GOOD TO BE BACK EH YES SHE LIED WHILE SHE QUAKED NOT NOW I CAN'T FACE THE JOB OF EXPLAINING NOW HE'S BEEN SO GOOD HE TRUSTS ME
IN WINTER CALIFORNIA IS FULL OF PEOPLE FROM IOWA AND NEBRASKA OHIO AND OKLAHOMA WHO HAVING TRAVELED THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM THEIR FAMILIAR VILLAGES HASTEN TO SECURE AN ILLUSION OF NOT HAVING LEFT THEM
THAT HE SEEMED ALWAYS TO BE WATCHING SOME ONE BACK IN THE DARKNESS OF THE BINS HE WAS SEEN SLIPPING THROUGH ALLEYS TALKING TO HIMSELF TRYING TO AVOID OBSERVATION CREEPING AT LAST TO THE CEMETERY ONCE CAROL FOLLOWED HIM
KENNICOTT WAS TRIUMPHANT WHEN THE COMMERCIAL CLUB DID CAPTURE ONE SMALL SHY FACTORY WHICH PLANNED TO MAKE WOODEN AUTOMOBILE WHEELS BUT WHEN CAROL SAW THE PROMOTER
AND NONE OF THE INTRIGANTE'S JOY IN FURTIVENESS IF SHE WAS THE NAIVE GIRL GUY POLLOCK WAS THE CLUMSY BOY HE RACED ABOUT THE OFFICE HE RAMMED HIS FISTS INTO HIS POCKETS HE STAMMERED I I I OH THE DEVIL
CLOTTED PAINT CANS ALL HALF COVERED BY THE ICY POOLS WHICH FILLED THE HOLLOWS OF THE YARDS THE REFUSE HAD STAINED THE WATER TO VILE COLORS OF WASTE THIN RED SOUR YELLOW STREAKY BROWN KENNICOTT CHUCKLED
SHE HAD SHE MEDITATED PASSED THROUGH THE NOVELTY OF SEEING THE TOWN AND MEETING PEOPLE OF SKATING AND SLIDING AND HUNTING BEA WAS COMPETENT THERE WAS NO HOUSEHOLD LABOR EXCEPT SEWING AND DARNING AND GOSSIPY ASSISTANCE TO BEA IN BED MAKING
THEN I FOUND THAT THE VILLAGE VIRUS HAD ME ABSOLUTE I DIDN'T WANT TO FACE NEW STREETS AND YOUNGER MEN REAL COMPETITION IT WAS TOO EASY TO GO ON MAKING OUT CONVEYANCES AND ARGUING DITCHING CASES SO
SHE CAUGHT SOMETHING OF AN IMPERSONAL ATTITUDE SAW THAT SHE HAD BEEN AS TOUCHILY PERSONAL AS MAUD DYER AND WHY SHE BEGAN TO ASK DID SHE RAGE AT INDIVIDUALS NOT INDIVIDUALS BUT INSTITUTIONS ARE THE ENEMIES
THAT WHEN SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE SHE SAW THE DOOR KNOBS THE NEWSPAPER ON THE TABLE EVERY WHITE SURFACE AS DAZZLING MAUVE AND HER HEAD WAS DIZZY IN THE PYROTECHNIC DIMNESS WHEN HER EYES HAD RECOVERED SHE FELT EXPANDED DRUNK WITH HEALTH MISTRESS OF LIFE
FOR A MONTH SMALL BOYS FOLLOWED HIM DOWN THE STREET AND EVERYBODY CALLED HIM MAJOR
YOU ARE WITHIN YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS IN REFUSING TO BE SUBJECTED TO THIS SUMMING UP I'M A TEDIOUS OLD FOOL ANALYZING THE OBVIOUS WHILE YOU'RE THE SPIRIT OF REBELLION TELL ME YOUR SIDE WHAT IS GOPHER PRAIRIE TO YOU A BORE
TO THE HALF DOZEN BRANCH STORES WHICH HE WAS ESTABLISHING AT CROSSROADS HAMLETS HARRY WOULD BE THE TOWN'S RICH MAN IN THE COMING GENERATION AND MAJOR WUTHERSPOON WOULD RISE WITH HIM AND VIDA WAS JUBILANT THOUGH SHE WAS REGRETFUL AT HAVING TO GIVE UP
THE DILLONS YES REALLY QUITE A DECENT YOUNG PAIR HARVEY DILLON AND HIS WIFE HE'S A DENTIST JUST COME TO TOWN THEY LIVE IN A ROOM BEHIND HIS OFFICE SAME AS I DO HERE THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH OF ANYBODY I'VE HEARD OF THEM
HE WAS WHISTLING TENDERLY STARING AT THE FURNACE WITH EYES WHICH SAW THE BLACK DOMED MONSTER AS A SYMBOL OF HOME AND OF THE BELOVED ROUTINE TO WHICH HE HAD RETURNED HIS GIPSYING DECENTLY ACCOMPLISHED
GUY CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING WITH THE TOWN REALLY NO WE CAN'T HE DISPOSED OF IT LIKE A JUDGE RULING OUT AN IMPROPER OBJECTION RETURNED TO MATTERS LESS UNCOMFORTABLY ENERGETIC CURIOUS
THOUGH IT ABSORBED MOST OF HER SALARY AN EXCELLENT NURSE FOR HUGH SHE HERSELF PUT HIM TO BED AND PLAYED WITH HIM ON HOLIDAYS THERE WERE WALKS WITH HIM THERE WERE MOTIONLESS EVENINGS OF READING BUT CHIEFLY WASHINGTON WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE
WHERE EVERY HOUSE WAS OPEN TO VIEW WHERE EVERY PERSON WAS BUT TOO EASY TO MEET WHERE THERE WERE NO SECRET GATES OPENING UPON MOORS OVER WHICH ONE MIGHT WALK BY MOSS DEADENED PATHS TO STRANGE HIGH ADVENTURES IN AN ANCIENT GARDEN
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX KENNICOTT WAS NOT SO INHUMANLY PATIENT THAT HE COULD CONTINUE TO FORGIVE CAROL'S HERESIES TO WOO HER AS HE HAD ON THE VENTURE TO CALIFORNIA SHE TRIED TO BE INCONSPICUOUS
I WON'T BELIEVE THAT MEDICINE THE PRIESTHOOD OF HEALING CAN BE TURNED INTO A PENNY PICKING BUSINESS SEE HERE HASN'T KENNICOTT EVER HINTED TO YOU THAT YOU'D BETTER BE NICE TO SOME OLD WOMAN BECAUSE SHE TELLS HER FRIENDS WHICH DOCTOR TO CALL IN BUT I OUGHTN'T TO
HER LIVELIEST ACTIVITY NOW WAS ORGANIZING OUTDOOR SPORTS IN THE MOTOR PARALYZED TOWN THE AUTOMOBILE AND BRIDGE WHIST HAD NOT ONLY MADE MORE EVIDENT THE SOCIAL DIVISIONS IN GOPHER PRAIRIE BUT THEY HAD ALSO ENFEEBLED THE LOVE OF ACTIVITY
WERE THE MEMBERS OF THE TINCOMB METHODIST CHURCH A VAST RED BRICK TABERNACLE VIDA SHERWIN HAD GIVEN HER A LETTER TO AN EARNEST WOMAN WITH EYE GLASSES PLAID SILK WAIST AND A BELIEF IN BIBLE CLASSES WHO INTRODUCED HER TO THE PASTOR AND THE
USUALLY YOU HAVE TO BE POLITE TO MY GARRULOUSNESS BUT NOW I'M SITTING AT YOUR FEET IT WOULD BE RATHER NICE TO HAVE YOU LITERALLY SITTING AT MY FEET BY A FIRE WOULD YOU HAVE A FIREPLACE FOR ME NATURALLY PLEASE DON'T SNUB ME NOW
AH HA SAYS THEY SO JIM BLAUSSER IS CLAIMING THAT GOPHER PRAIRIE IS AS GOOD A PLACE TO LIVE IN AS LONDON AND ROME AND AND ALL THE REST OF THE BIG BURGS IS HE HOW DOES THE POOR FISH KNOW SAYS THEY WELL
HOW YOUR HUSBAND AND WESTLAKE AND GOULD DISLIKE ONE ANOTHER
HER DISCOVERY THAT SHE REALLY COULD GET AWAY FROM MAIN STREET WAS AS SWEET AS THE DISCOVERY OF LOVE KENNICOTT NEVER CONSENTED DEFINITELY AT MOST HE AGREED TO A PUBLIC THEORY THAT SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE A SHORT TRIP
CHAMP WAS BROKEN HIS RHEUMATISM WAS WORSE THE ROOMS OVER THE STORE WERE SILENT HE COULD NOT DO HIS WORK AS BUYER AT THE ELEVATOR FARMERS COMING IN WITH SLED LOADS OF WHEAT COMPLAINED THAT CHAMP COULD NOT READ THE SCALE
AND THE SAME THING GOES FOR THAT CROWD OF CRABS AND SNOBS DOWN EAST AND NEXT TIME YOU HEAR SOME ZOB FROM YAHOOVILLE ON THE HUDSON CHEWING THE RAG AND BULLING AND TRYING TO GET YOUR GOAT YOU TELL HIM THAT NO TWO FISTED ENTERPRISING WESTERNER WOULD HAVE NEW YORK FOR A GIFT
THEY SENT ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN SOUVENIR POST CARDS TO GOPHER PRAIRIE
DRIPPING SOOT FROM EAVES AND DOORWAY ROLLED OUT SMOKE IN GREASY COILS OTHER TOWNS SHE CAME TO KNOW BY ANECDOTE A PRAIRIE VILLAGE WHERE THE WIND BLEW ALL DAY LONG AND THE MUD WAS TWO FEET THICK IN SPRING AND IN SUMMER
AND YOU AND ALL THESE LONG HAIRED MEN AND SHORT HAIRED WOMEN CAN BEEF ALL YOU WANT TO BUT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THESE FELLOWS AND IF THEY AIN'T PATRIOTIC WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM BE PATRIOTIC AND LORD KNOWS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D HAVE TO SAY THIS TO MY OWN WIFE

HE WAS A LAYER ON OF HANDS HE NEVER CAME TO THE HOUSE WITHOUT TRYING TO PAW HER HE TOUCHED HER ARM LET HIS FIST BRUSH HER SIDE SHE HATED THE MAN AND SHE WAS AFRAID OF HIM SHE WONDERED IF HE HAD HEARD OF ERIK AND WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE
SHE REMEMBERED CERTAIN REMARKS WHICH KENNICOTT HAD OFFERED REGARDING THE WIDOW BOGART SHE FLINCHED LOOKED AT GUY BESEECHINGLY HE SPRANG UP STRODE TO HER WITH A NERVOUS STEP SMOOTHED HER HAND
WHILE KENNICOTT SEESAWED ON HIS TOES AND CHUCKLED WONDER WHAT HUGH'LL SAY WHEN HE SEES US
AND WHEN HE WAS LOST SHE WANTED TO LEAP FROM THE VESTIBULE AND RUN BACK TO HIM SHE THOUGHT OF A HUNDRED TENDERNESSES SHE HAD NEGLECTED SHE HAD HER FREEDOM AND IT WAS EMPTY THE MOMENT WAS NOT THE HIGHEST OF HER LIFE BUT THE LOWEST AND MOST DESOLATE
THE BOYS WORE SHOE PACKS BLUE FLANNEL SHIRTS WITH ENORMOUS PEARL BUTTONS AND MACKINAWS OF CRIMSON LEMON YELLOW AND FOXY BROWN CAROL CRIED FINE DAY TO THE BOYS SHE CAME IN A GLOW TO HOWLAND AND GOULD'S GROCERY
ALONG WITH GENERAL GRANT'S SWORD AND I'M OH I SUPPOSE I'M SEEKING FOR A GOSPEL THAT WILL EVANGELIZE GOPHER PRAIRIE REALLY EVANGELIZE IT TO WHAT TO ANYTHING THAT'S DEFINITE SERIOUSNESS OR FRIVOLOUSNESS OR BOTH
SHE LEARNED THAT PLOVER AND MINNIEMASHIE LAKES WERE WORLD FAMED FOR THEIR BEAUTEOUS WOODED SHORES AND GAMEY PIKE AND BASS NOT TO BE EQUALLED ELSEWHERE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT THE RESIDENCES OF GOPHER PRAIRIE WERE MODELS
ON A SWING SHELF WAS A ROW OF BOOKS UNFAMILIAR TO GOPHER PRAIRIE MOSHER EDITIONS OF THE POETS BLACK AND RED GERMAN NOVELS A CHARLES LAMB IN CRUSHED LEVANT GUY DID NOT SIT DOWN HE QUARTERED THE OFFICE

KENNICOTT DISCUSSED LAND PRICES WITH THEM HE WENT INTO THE MERITS OF THE SEVERAL SORTS OF MOTOR CARS WITH THEM HE WAS INTIMATE WITH TRAIN PORTERS AND HE INSISTED ON SEEING THE LUKE DAWSONS AT THEIR FLIMSY BUNGALOW IN PASADENA
BY GOLLY HE KNOWS US JUST AS IF WE'D NEVER BEEN AWAY SAID KENNICOTT YOU DON'T FIND ANY OF THESE CALIFORNIA KIDS AS BRIGHT AS HE IS AT HIS AGE
POINTING WITH PRIDE HARRY HAYDOCK AS CHAIRMAN INTRODUCED HONEST JIM BLAUSSER AND I AM PROUD TO SAY MY FELLOW CITIZENS THAT IN HIS BRIEF STAY HERE MISTER BLAUSSER HAS BECOME MY WARM PERSONAL FRIEND AS WELL AS MY FELLOW BOOSTER
SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY YOU WHY DO YOU STAY HERE I HAVE THE VILLAGE VIRUS IT SOUNDS DANGEROUS IT IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CANCER THAT WILL CERTAINLY GET ME AT FIFTY UNLESS I STOP THIS SMOKING
THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS EVEN RIGHT HERE IN THIS FAIR STATE FAIREST AND RICHEST OF ALL THE GLORIOUS UNION THAT STAND UP ON THEIR HIND LEGS AND CLAIM THAT THE EAST AND EUROPE PUT IT ALL OVER THE GOLDEN NORTHWESTLAND NOW LET ME NAIL THAT LIE RIGHT HERE AND NOW
NOT TO HAVE TO REPORT TO KENNICOTT AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL THAT SHE HAD DONE OR MIGHT DO WAS A RELIEF WHICH MADE UP FOR THE OFFICE WEARINESS SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER ONE HALF OF A MARRIAGE
BUT EVER SO MUCH SICKER ON NO COOKIES AT ALL THAT'S FOOLISH IT IS O MALE KENNICOTT HUH SAID KENNICOTT TWO AND WENT TO SLEEP ON HER SHOULDER
THEY WERE COMPOSED OF ORNAMENTED POSTS WITH CLUSTERS OF HIGH POWERED ELECTRIC LIGHTS ALONG TWO OR THREE BLOCKS ON MAIN STREET THE DAUNTLESS CONFESSED WHITE WAY IS INSTALLED TOWN LIT UP LIKE BROADWAY SPEECH BY HON JAMES BLAUSSER
HE HAD BEEN SPOILED BY AUNT BESSIE EVEN TO A RETURNED MOTHER HIS WHINING AND HIS TRICK OF SEVEN TIMES SNATCHING HER SILVER BRUSH WERE FATIGUING

AND MY OWN SON REPROVES ME BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GIVEN HIM RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION BUT THE STORY DOESN'T GO RIGHT I'M NEITHER GROANING NOR BEING DRAMATICALLY SAVED I KEEP ON RUNNING AWAY AND I ENJOY IT I'M MAD WITH JOY OVER IT
THEY STEPPED UNCOMFORTABLY FROM THE SAFETY OF THE PLANK PLATFORM AND BALANCING ON THEIR TOES TAKING CAUTIOUS STRIDES VENTURED ALONG THE ROAD THE SLEETY RAIN WAS TURNING TO SNOW THE AIR WAS STEALTHILY COLD BENEATH AN INCH OF WATER WAS A LAYER OF ICE
A FREE SUNDAY IT DID NOT APPEAR THAT THE GREAT WORLD NEEDED HER INSPIRATION BUT SHE FELT THAT HER LETTERS HER CONTACT WITH THE ANXIETIES OF MEN AND WOMEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WERE A PART OF VAST AFFAIRS
NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT COMPLICATION DID YOU IN THIS OFF TO BOHEMIA AND EXPRESS YOURSELF AND FREE LOVE AND LIVE YOUR OWN LIFE STUFF YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO ME IF YOU CAN KEEP ME CAN YOU HE MOVED UNEASILY
I DON'T BELONG TO GOPHER PRAIRIE THAT ISN'T MEANT AS A CONDEMNATION OF GOPHER PRAIRIE AND IT MAY BE A CONDEMNATION OF ME ALL RIGHT I DON'T CARE I DON'T BELONG HERE AND I'M GOING I'M NOT ASKING PERMISSION ANY MORE I'M SIMPLY GOING HE GRUNTED
AND ANNOUNCED THAT IN A FEW DAYS HE WOULD ADDRESS A FARMERS POLITICAL MEETING THAT NIGHT THE NEWS RAN A MOB OF A HUNDRED BUSINESS MEN LED BY THE SHERIFF THE TAME VILLAGE STREET AND THE SMUG VILLAGE FACES RUDDLED BY THE LIGHT OF BOBBING LANTERNS
AND WE CALLED THE PORTER THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD PORTER ON THAT CAR AND WE HAD A COUPLE BOTTLES OF GINGER ALE
THERE'VE BEEN A GOOD MANY TIMES WHEN WE HADN'T A MAID AND I DID ALL THE HOUSEWORK AND CARED FOR HUGH AND WENT TO RED CROSS AND DID IT ALL VERY EFFICIENTLY I'M A GOOD COOK AND A GOOD SWEEPER
CAROL WAITED FOR HIM IN THE STATION AMONG HUDDLED GERMAN WOMEN WITH SHAWLS AND UMBRELLAS AND RAGGED BEARDED FARMERS IN CORDUROY COATS PEASANTS MUTE AS OXEN IN A ROOM THICK WITH THE STEAM OF WET COATS THE REEK OF THE RED HOT STOVE
HALF AN HOUR LATER CHAIRMAN HAYDOCK MOVED A VOTE OF THANKS TO MISTER BLAUSSER THE BOOSTERS CAMPAIGN WAS ON THE TOWN SOUGHT THAT EFFICIENT AND MODERN VARIETY OF FAME WHICH IS KNOWN AS PUBLICITY
YES SHE GIVES ME COOKIES AND SHE TELLS ME ABOUT THE DEAR LORD YOU NEVER TELL ME ABOUT THE DEAR LORD WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE DEAR LORD AUNTIE BOGART SAYS I'M GOING TO BE A PREACHER CAN I BE A PREACHER CAN I PREACH ABOUT THE DEAR LORD
THESE BUSINESS MEN FROM THEIR CRUSHING LABORS OF SITTING IN AN OFFICE SEVEN HOURS A DAY WOULD CALMLY RECOMMEND THAT I HAVE A DOZEN CHILDREN AS IT HAPPENS I'VE DONE THAT SORT OF THING
THE WOMAN WAS MYSTERY ROMANCE A STORY WHICH TOLD ITSELF DIFFERENTLY EVERY DAY NOW SHE WAS A MURDERESS NOW THE NEGLECTED WIFE OF AN AMBASSADOR IT WAS MYSTERY WHICH CAROL HAD MOST LACKED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE
BUT SOLITARY DISH WASHING ISN'T ENOUGH TO SATISFY ME OR MANY OTHER WOMEN WE'RE GOING TO CHUCK IT WE'RE GOING TO WASH EM BY MACHINERY AND COME OUT AND PLAY WITH YOU MEN IN THE OFFICES AND CLUBS AND POLITICS YOU'VE CLEVERLY KEPT FOR YOURSELVES
AND BECAUSE IN THE STRESS OF WAR WORK WITH ITS DEMAND FOR THOUSANDS OF TEMPORARY CLERKS SHE COULD BE INITIATED INTO THE WORLD OF OFFICES HUGH WAS TO GO WITH HER DESPITE THE WAILS AND RATHER EXTENSIVE COMMENTS OF AUNT BESSIE
IN THREE MONTHS KENNICOTT MADE SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH WAS RATHER MORE THAN FOUR TIMES AS MUCH AS SOCIETY PAID HIM FOR HEALING THE SICK IN EARLY SUMMER BEGAN A CAMPAIGN OF BOOSTING
I FEEL LIKE A CHILD YET I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR FATHER SO IT'S DECENTLY PATERNAL TO IMAGINE YOU CURLED AT MY FEET OF COURSE I HOPE IT ISN'T BUT WE'LL REFLECT THE MORALS OF GOPHER PRAIRIE BY OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCING THAT IT IS THESE STANDARDS THAT YOU AND I LIVE UP TO
RINGING TO THE SKATES ON SHORE THE ICE TIPPED REEDS CLATTERED IN THE WIND AND OAK TWIGS WITH STUBBORN LAST LEAVES HUNG AGAINST A MILKY SKY HARRY HAYDOCK DID FIGURE EIGHTS AND CAROL WAS CERTAIN THAT SHE HAD FOUND THE PERFECT LIFE
LET'S HAVE MY WHOLE DUTY AS A WIFE HE WAS GRUMBLING THE WHOLE THING'S RIGHT IN LINE WITH THE CRITICISM YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN MAKING MIGHT HAVE KNOWN YOU'D OPPOSE ANY DECENT CONSTRUCTIVE WORK FOR THE TOWN OR FOR YOU'RE RIGHT ALL I'VE DONE HAS BEEN IN LINE
I THINK WE'D BETTER WALK PROBABLY MAKE BETTER TIME AND I'M JUST CRAZY TO SEE MY BABY WITH THEIR SUIT CASES THEY WADDLED ON THEIR COATS WERE SOAKED THROUGH CAROL HAD FORGOTTEN HER
THE DIAGNOSIS OF MY VILLAGE VIRUS IS SIMPLE ENOUGH I WAS BORN IN AN OHIO TOWN ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS GOPHER PRAIRIE AND MUCH LESS FRIENDLY IT'D HAD MORE GENERATIONS IN WHICH TO FORM AN OLIGARCHY OF RESPECTABILITY
WHICH HE HELD IN HIS MOUTH LIKE AN EXTRAORDINARY SET OF EXTERNAL FALSE TEETH THE UNIVERSAL SIGN OF WINTER WAS THE TOWN HANDYMAN MILES BJORNSTAM A TALL THICK RED MUSTACHED BACHELOR OPINIONATED ATHEIST GENERAL STORE ARGUER
PASSED HER THE GINGERBREAD AND SCALLOPED POTATOES AT CHURCH SUPPERS AND IN GENERAL MADE HER VERY UNHAPPY AND LONELY SO THAT SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENLIST IN THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE ORGANIZATION AND BE ALLOWED TO GO TO JAIL
SHE WAS SILENT WHEN VIDA RAVED THAT THOUGH AMERICA HATED WAR AS MUCH AS EVER WE MUST INVADE GERMANY AND WIPE OUT EVERY MAN BECAUSE IT WAS NOW PROVEN THAT THERE WAS NO SOLDIER IN THE GERMAN ARMY WHO WAS NOT CRUCIFYING PRISONERS
SHE COULDN'T SATISFY HER INGENUITY IN PLANNING MEALS AT DAHL AND OLESON'S MEAT MARKET YOU DIDN'T GIVE ORDERS YOU WOFULLY INQUIRED WHETHER THERE WAS ANYTHING TODAY BESIDES STEAK AND PORK AND HAM THE CUTS OF BEEF WERE NOT CUTS THEY WERE HACKS
AND I'M GOING TO BREAK HIS HEART SHE SMILED AT HIM
SHE ASSURED HERSELF THAT THE STREETS OF NEW YORK AND CHICAGO WERE AS UGLY AS GOPHER PRAIRIE IN SUCH WEATHER SHE DISMISSED THE THOUGHT BUT THEY DO HAVE CHARMING INTERIORS FOR REFUGE
THE HOUSE REEKED WITH A COLORLESS STILLNESS FROM THE WINDOW SHE HEARD KENNICOTT GREETING THE WIDOW BOGART AS HE HAD ALWAYS DONE ALWAYS EVERY SNOWY EVENING GUESS THIS LL KEEP UP ALL NIGHT SHE WAITED THERE THEY WERE
HAD SHE FOR ONE MINUTE LEFT THIS SCRAPING SOUND OF THE SMALL SHOVEL IN THE ASH PIT OF THE FURNACE BUT KENNICOTT PREPOSTEROUSLY SUPPOSED THAT SHE HAD NEVER HAD SHE BEEN QUITE SO FAR FROM GOING AWAY AS NOW WHEN HE BELIEVED SHE HAD JUST COME BACK
DRENCHED CIGAR ASHES GRADUALLY FILLING THE SAUCERS OF COFFEE CUPS AND ORATORICAL REFERENCES TO PEP PUNCH GO VIGOR ENTERPRISE RED BLOOD HE MEN FAIR WOMEN GOD'S COUNTRY JAMES J HILL

AND THEY'D HAVE ANOTHER SKIING EXPEDITION RIGHT AWAY AND THEY JOLLILY RETURNED HOME AND NEVER THEREAFTER LEFT THEIR MANUALS OF BRIDGE CAROL WAS DISCOURAGED SHE WAS GRATEFUL WHEN KENNICOTT INVITED HER TO GO RABBIT HUNTING IN THE WOODS
AND EVEN IF I AM COWARDLY AND RUN AWAY ALL RIGHT CALL IT COWARDLY CALL ME ANYTHING YOU WANT TO I'VE BEEN RULED TOO LONG BY FEAR OF BEING CALLED THINGS I'M GOING AWAY TO BE QUIET AND THINK I'M I'M GOING I HAVE A RIGHT TO MY OWN LIFE
A GRAYHOUND ON THE SCENT A GRAYHOUND WITH GLASSES TILTED FORWARD ON HIS THIN NOSE AND A SILKY INDECISIVE BROWN MUSTACHE HE HAD A GOLF JACKET OF JERSEY WORN THROUGH AT THE CREASES IN THE SLEEVES SHE NOTED

WHICH INCLUDED SEVEN DISTINCT AND PROVEN SCANDALS ABOUT MISSUS SWIFTWAITE AND ONE CONSIDERABLE DOUBT AS TO THE CHASTITY OF CY BOGART THEY SAW THE FORD SEDAN MAKING ITS WAY OVER THE WATER LINED ICE THROUGH THE SNOW STORM
SHE SWORE IT WITH SOFT FIST BEATING THE EDGES OF THE RADIATOR AND AT THE END OF ALL HER VOWS SHE HAD NO NOTION AS TO WHEN AND WHERE THE CRUSADE WAS TO BEGIN BECOME AN AUTHENTIC PART OF THE TOWN
HE WAS A SERIOUS AND LITERAL PERSON AND RATHER HUMORLESS SHE KISSED HIS FROWN AND MARVELED I AM RUNNING AWAY FROM MY HUSBAND AFTER LIKING A SWEDISH NE'ER DO WELL AND EXPRESSING IMMORAL OPINIONS JUST AS IN A ROMANTIC STORY
A FEW YEARS AGO I WAS TALKING TO A PATENT LAWYER FROM CHICAGO AND I REALIZED THAT I'D ALWAYS FELT SO SUPERIOR TO PEOPLE LIKE JULIUS FLICKERBAUGH BUT I SAW THAT I WAS AS PROVINCIAL AND BEHIND THE TIMES AS JULIUS WORSE
WASN'T SAM RATHER NEEDLESSLY HEROIC ALL THESE ORGANIZERS YES
SHE LOOKED ABOUT WITH IMPERSONAL EYES BUT KENNICOTT THROUGH RAIN BLURRED LASHES CAUGHT THE GLORY THAT WAS BACK HOME
ACROSS IT HE PEERED AT HER WITH SUCH LONELINESS THAT SHE WAS STARTLED BUT HIS EYES FADED INTO IMPERSONALITY AS HE TALKED OF THE JEALOUSIES OF GOPHER PRAIRIE HE STOPPED HIMSELF WITH A SHARP GOOD LORD CAROL YOU'RE NOT A JURY
OH WHAT IS THERE TO CONFIDE THE PEOPLE ARE SAVORLESS AND PROUD OF IT AND EVEN IF I LIKED YOU TREMENDOUSLY I COULDN'T TALK TO YOU WITHOUT TWENTY OLD HEXES WATCHING WHISPERING
AND MISTER STOWBODY A CAPITALIST BUT YOU BUSINESS MEN ARE GOING TO BEAT ALL THE REST OF US AT IT WITH YOUR SIMPLE HEARTED ENERGETIC POMPOUS SHE GOT SO FAR ONLY BECAUSE KENNICOTT WAS SLOW IN SHAKING OFF RESPECT FOR HER NOW HE BAYED
SHE FELT OOZING THROUGH THE WALLS THE SPIRIT OF SMALL HOUSES AND RIGHTEOUS PEOPLE AT THAT INSTANT SHE KNEW THAT IN RUNNING AWAY SHE HAD MERELY HIDDEN HER DOUBTS BEHIND THE OFFICIOUS STIR OF TRAVEL DEAR GOD DON'T LET ME BEGIN AGONIZING AGAIN SHE SOBBED
AND A WHITE AND GREEN HOUSE FILLED WITH BOOKS AND SILVER TEA SETS AND COOKIES COOKIES OH MOST DECIDEDLY COOKIES WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF BREAD AND PORRIDGE
WELD AN AUTOMOBILE SPRING SOOTHE A FRIGHTENED FILLY TINKER A CLOCK CARVE A GLOUCESTER SCHOONER WHICH MAGICALLY WENT INTO A BOTTLE NOW FOR A WEEK HE WAS COMMISSIONER GENERAL OF GOPHER PRAIRIE
THE VILLAGE VIRUS IS THE GERM WHICH IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY LIKE THE HOOK WORM IT INFECTS AMBITIOUS PEOPLE WHO STAY TOO LONG IN THE PROVINCES YOU'LL FIND IT EPIDEMIC AMONG LAWYERS AND DOCTORS AND MINISTERS AND COLLEGE BRED MERCHANTS
RIVERSIDE THROUGH TOWNS WITH BELL TOWERED MISSIONS AND ORANGE GROVES THEY VIEWED MONTEREY AND SAN FRANCISCO AND A FOREST OF SEQUOIAS THEY BATHED IN THE SURF AND CLIMBED FOOTHILLS AND DANCED THEY SAW A POLO GAME AND THE MAKING OF MOTION PICTURES
WHILE SAM NODDED AT HER OVER KENNICOTT'S SHOULDER SHE WAS EMBARRASSED PERHAPS I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GONE AWAY I'M OUT OF PRACTISE IN LYING I WISH THEY WOULD GET IT OVER JUST A BLOCK MORE AND MY BABY
BUT ONE THING I'M NOT GOING TO STAND I'M NOT GOING TO STAND MY OWN WIFE BEING SEDITIOUS YOU CAN CAMOUFLAGE ALL YOU WANT TO BUT YOU KNOW DARN WELL THAT THESE RADICALS AS YOU CALL EM ARE OPPOSED TO THE WAR AND LET ME TELL YOU RIGHT HERE AND NOW
ASKING A HUNDRED QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM HAD HE HAD ANY COLDS DID HE STILL DAWDLE OVER HIS OATMEAL WHAT ABOUT UNFORTUNATE MORNING INCIDENTS

SHE SAW A PENCIL MARK ON A WINDOW SILL SHE HAD MADE IT ON A SEPTEMBER DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN PLANNING A PICNIC FOR FERN MULLINS AND ERIK FERN AND SHE HAD BEEN HYSTERICAL WITH NONSENSE HAD INVENTED MAD PARTIES FOR ALL THE COMING WINTER
ONLY BY SUCH FUSSING AS THE WIDOW BOGART'S COULD SHE MAKE IT FILL HER TIME SHE COULD NOT HAVE OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT TO THE VILLAGE DOCTOR'S WIFE IT WAS TABOO SHE WAS A WOMAN WITH A WORKING BRAIN AND NO WORK
FLATLY WE'RE GOING TO FIND ELEPHANTS WITH GOLDEN HOWDAHS FROM WHICH PEEP YOUNG MAHARANEES WITH NECKLACES OF RUBIES AND A DAWN SEA COLORED LIKE THE BREAST OF A DOVE

THEY GOT THE FEED STORE ALL FIXED UP AND A NEW SIGN ON IT BLACK AND GOLD THAT'LL IMPROVE THE APPEARANCE OF THE BLOCK A LOT SHE NOTED THAT THE FEW PEOPLE WHOM THEY PASSED WORE THEIR RAGGEDEST COATS FOR THE EVIL DAY
MAYBE IT WASN'T EXACTLY REGULAR BUT WHAT'S THE ODDS THEY KNEW THIS FELLOW WOULD TRY TO STIR UP TROUBLE WHENEVER IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO A QUESTION OF DEFENDING AMERICANISM AND OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IT'S JUSTIFIABLE TO SET ASIDE ORDINARY PROCEDURE
MISSUS MC GANUM AND I HAVEN'T ANY PARTICULAR CRUSH ON EACH OTHER SHE'S SO STOLID BUT HER MOTHER MISSUS WESTLAKE NOBODY COULD BE SWEETER YES I'M SURE SHE'S VERY BLAND
DISLOYAL NON PATRIOTIC PRO GERMAN PACIFISTS THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE DID THIS ORGANIZER SAY ANYTHING PRO GERMAN NOT ON YOUR LIFE THEY DIDN'T GIVE HIM A CHANCE HIS LAUGH WAS STAGEY
WITH ORANGE CURTAINS AND POTS OF MIGNONETTE MARBLE HOUSES ON NEW HAMPSHIRE AVENUE WITH BUTLERS AND LIMOUSINES AND MEN WHO LOOKED LIKE FICTIONAL EXPLORERS AND AVIATORS HER DAYS WERE SWIFT AND SHE KNEW THAT IN HER FOLLY OF RUNNING AWAY
THE BAND WAS REORGANIZED AND PROVIDED BY THE COMMERCIAL CLUB WITH UNIFORMS OF PURPLE AND GOLD THE AMATEUR BASEBALL TEAM HIRED A SEMI PROFESSIONAL PITCHER FROM DES MOINES
SO THE WHOLE THING WAS ILLEGAL AND LED BY THE SHERIFF PRECISELY HOW DO YOU EXPECT THESE ALIENS TO OBEY YOUR LAW IF THE OFFICER OF THE LAW TEACHES THEM TO BREAK IT IS IT A NEW KIND OF LOGIC
SO HAVE I TO MINE WELL I HAVE A RIGHT TO MY LIFE AND YOU'RE IT YOU'RE MY LIFE YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF SO I'M DAMNED IF I'LL AGREE TO ALL YOUR FREAK NOTIONS BUT I WILL SAY I'VE GOT TO DEPEND ON YOU

SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENCOUNTER ERIK IN THE EAST BUT IT WAS A CHANCE THOUGHT SOON FORGOTTEN
SHE MOURNED IT'S ONLY THE BABY THAT HOLDS ME IF HUGH DIED
CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE SHE TRIED TO BE CONTENT WHICH WAS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS SHE FANATICALLY CLEANED HOUSE ALL APRIL SHE KNITTED A SWEATER FOR HUGH SHE WAS DILIGENT AT RED CROSS WORK
AND KENNICOTT HAD TO MAKE HIMSELF HUMBLE AND COURT BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD THE DIM INJUSTICE OF NOT BEING UNDERSTOOD EVEN BY HIS SON LEFT HIM IRRITABLE HE FELT INJURED AN EVENT WHICH DID NOT DIRECTLY TOUCH THEM BROUGHT DOWN HIS WRATH
AND I'VE NEVER THOUGHT TO CALL I'M HORRIBLY ASHAMED DO BRING THEM SHE STOPPED FOR NO VERY CLEAR REASON BUT HIS EXPRESSION SAID HER FALTERING ADMITTED THAT THEY WISHED THEY HAD NEVER MENTIONED THE DILLONS
BUT CAROL COULD DISCOVER NO MORE PICTURES NOR INTERESTING FOOD NOR GRACIOUS VOICES NOR AMUSING CONVERSATION NOR QUESTING MINDS SHE COULD SHE ASSERTED ENDURE A SHABBY BUT MODEST TOWN
CHILDREN YES SHE WANTED THEM BUT SHE WAS NOT QUITE READY SHE HAD BEEN EMBARRASSED BY KENNICOTT'S FRANKNESS BUT SHE AGREED WITH HIM THAT IN THE INSANE CONDITION OF CIVILIZATION
DID NOT KEEP HER FROM BEING PROUD OF THEM FROM DEFENDING THEM IN IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH KENNICOTT WHO GRUNTED SHE COULD HEAR HIS VOICE THEY'RE SIMPLY A BUNCH OF WILD IMPRACTICAL THEORISTS SITTIN ROUND CHEWING THE RAG AND
BUT SHE WAS BETRAYED BY HER FAILURE TO GLOW OVER THE BOOSTING KENNICOTT BELIEVED IN IT DEMANDED THAT SHE SAY PATRIOTIC THINGS ABOUT THE WHITE WAY AND THE NEW FACTORY HE SNORTED BY GOLLY I'VE DONE ALL I COULD
THEY WERE NOT AT HOME LIKE A CHILD WHO HAS NO ONE TO PLAY WITH SHE LOITERED THROUGH THE DARK HALL SHE SAW A LIGHT UNDER AN OFFICE DOOR SHE KNOCKED TO THE PERSON WHO OPENED SHE MURMURED DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE THE PERRYS ARE
HIS DUTY OF VIEWING SIGHTS AND CURIOS PERFORMED WITH THOROUGHNESS UNCONSCIOUS OF HER HE STOOPED AND PEERED IN AT THE BLUE FLAMES AMONG THE COALS HE CLOSED THE DOOR BRISKLY AND MADE A WHIRLING GESTURE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND OUT OF PURE BLISS
THERE WERE AS MANY DISTINCTIONS IN WRAPS AS IN MOTOR CARS THE LESSER SORT APPEARED IN YELLOW AND BLACK DOGSKIN COATS BUT KENNICOTT WAS LORDLY IN A LONG RACCOON ULSTER AND A NEW SEAL CAP WHEN THE SNOW WAS TOO DEEP FOR HIS MOTOR
SHE WADED DOWN STILLY CLOISTERS BETWEEN BURNT STUMP AND ICY OAK THROUGH DRIFTS MARKED WITH A MILLION HIEROGLYPHICS OF RABBIT AND MOUSE AND BIRD SHE SQUEALED AS HE LEAPED ON A PILE OF BRUSH AND FIRED AT THE RABBIT WHICH RAN OUT HE BELONGED THERE

MISSUS KENNICOTT CONFIDED TO YE SCRIBE THAT SHE WILL BE CONNECTED WITH ONE OF THE MULTIFARIOUS WAR ACTIVITIES NOW CENTERING IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL FOR A BRIEF PERIOD BEFORE RETURNING HER COUNTLESS FRIENDS WHO APPRECIATE HER SPLENDID LABORS WITH THE LOCAL RED CROSS
BUT THEY PLAYED VERY SIMPLY AND THEY SAW NO REASON WHY ANYTHING WHICH EXISTS CANNOT ALSO BE ACKNOWLEDGED SHE WAS SOMETIMES SHOCKED QUITE AS SHE HAD SHOCKED GOPHER PRAIRIE BY THESE GIRLS WITH THEIR CIGARETTES AND ELFISH KNOWLEDGE
SHE COULD NOT FEEL THAT HIS COMING MUCH MATTERED AND A YEAR AFTER WHEN HE FAILED SHE COULD NOT BE VERY SORROWFUL

THE WIFE CONTINUED SENTIMENTALLY FIVE AND TWENTY GUINEAS WAS MONSTROUSLY DEAR FOR THAT LITTLE PIANO
AS RAWDON IN HIS EVENING COSTUME WHICH HE HAD NOW WORN TWO DAYS PASSED BY THE SCARED FEMALE WHO WAS SCOURING THE STEPS AND ENTERED INTO HIS BROTHER'S STUDY LADY JANE
AND PRONOUNCE HIM A GOOD NATURED JOVIAL RECKLESS FELLOW
RUMMAGING HIS MOTHER'S DESK SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FOUND THE GLOVES NEATLY FOLDED UP
TURN THE ELEPHANT TO THE CAPTAIN BLOWMAN
I DAREN'T SLEEP IN WHAT THEY CALL MY BEDROOM THE BED IS LIKE THE BALDAQUIN OF SAINT PETER'S AND THE PICTURES FRIGHTEN ME I HAVE A LITTLE BRASS BED IN A DRESSING ROOM AND A LITTLE HAIR MATTRESS LIKE AN ANCHORITE I AM AN ANCHORITE
WHEN I'M IN THE ARMY WON'T I HATE THE FRENCH THAT'S ALL
IN A WAY WHICH EVEN MADE THE BOY SMILE SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE THOUGHT MAJOR WILLIAM WAS THE BEST MAN IN ALL THE WORLD THE GENTLEST AND THE KINDEST THE BRAVEST AND THE HUMBLEST
THERE WAS NO NEED OF THIS CAUTION FOR THE ELDER SEDLEY HIMSELF BEGAN IMMEDIATELY TO SPEAK OF THE EVENT AND PRATTLED ABOUT IT AND WEPT OVER IT PLENTEOUSLY IT SHOCKED THE INDIAN NOT A LITTLE AND MADE HIM THINK OF HIMSELF LESS THAN THE POOR FELLOW WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO
THANK YOU WILLIAM SHE HELD OUT HER HAND BUT THE POOR LITTLE WOMAN'S HEART WAS BLEEDING AND AS FOR HER EYES OF COURSE THEY WERE AT THEIR WORK BUT WILLIAM COULD HOLD NO MORE AMELIA AMELIA HE SAID I DID BUY IT FOR YOU
NOTHING COULD INDUCE HER FRIEND TO GO WITHOUT HER WHAT YOU WHO HAVE SHOWN THE POOR ORPHAN WHAT HAPPINESS AND LOVE ARE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HER LIFE QUIT YOU NEVER AND THE GREEN EYES LOOKED UP TO HEAVEN AND FILLED WITH TEARS
IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE DID NOT PURCHASE THE INSTRUMENT FOR HIS OWN USE IN A WORD IT ARRIVED THAT EVENING AT A WONDERFUL SMALL COTTAGE IN A STREET LEADING FROM THE FULHAM ROAD ONE OF THOSE STREETS WHICH HAVE THE FINEST ROMANTIC NAMES THIS WAS CALLED SAINT ADELAIDE VILLAS
CAPTAIN MACMURDO HAD THE HONOUR OF WAITING UPON THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE ON THE PART OF COLONEL RAWDON CRAWLEY AND BEGGED TO INTIMATE THAT HE WAS EMPOWERED BY THE COLONEL
YES WE SAW HIM FATE CANNOT DEPRIVE US OF THAT OTHERS HAVE SEEN NAPOLEON SOME FEW STILL EXIST WHO HAVE BEHELD FREDERICK THE GREAT DOCTOR JOHNSON
MISSUS RAWDON AT LENGTH HAD PITY UPON HER ADMIRER AND CALLING TO BRIGGS PRAISED THE FINENESS OF THE WEATHER TO HER AND BADE HER TO TAKE OUT THE CHILD FOR A WALK I CAN'T SEND HER AWAY BECKY SAID PRESENTLY
MUSWELL HILL BUT WE MUST NOT LET THE RECOLLECTIONS OF THIS GOOD FELLOW CAUSE US TO DIVERGE FROM THE PRINCIPAL HISTORY
THE FAMILIAR HOUSE OF WHICH THE LIGHTS USED TO SHINE SO CHEERFULLY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK OF WHICH THE HALL DOORS OPENED SO READILY
DID YOU EVER HEAR ANYTHING LIKE YOUR BROTHER'S ELOQUENCE WHISPERED MISTER OSBORNE TO AMELIA WHY YOUR FRIEND HAS WORKED MIRACLES THE MORE THE BETTER SAID MISS AMELIA WHO LIKE ALMOST ALL WOMEN WHO ARE WORTH A PIN
AT WHICH SPEECH EVEN MISTER SAMBO AT THE SIDEBOARD BURST OUT LAUGHING AND POOR FAT JOE FELT INCLINED TO BECOME A PARRICIDE ALMOST UNDO HIS STAYS CONTINUED THE PITILESS OLD GENTLEMAN
THE BROCADE WAS AN OLD REMNANT BECKY SAID AND AS FOR THE LACE IT WAS A GREAT BARGAIN SHE HAD HAD IT THESE HUNDRED YEARS MY DEAR MISSUS CRAWLEY
FOR YOUR MOTHER'S SAKE DEAR MISTER SEDLEY SHE SAID
AND AS OBLIGED THE YOUNG PEOPLE PERFORCE TO REMAIN AT HOME MISTER OSBORNE DID NOT SEEM IN THE LEAST DISAPPOINTED AT THIS OCCURRENCE HE AND JOSEPH SEDLEY DRANK A FITTING QUANTITY OF PORT WINE TETE A TETE IN THE DINING ROOM
BETTER DAYS AS FAR AS WORLDLY PROSPERITY WENT WERE IN STORE FOR BOTH PERHAPS THE INGENIOUS READER HAS GUESSED WHO WAS THE STOUT GENTLEMAN WHO CALLED UPON GEORGY AT HIS SCHOOL IN COMPANY WITH OUR OLD FRIEND MAJOR DOBBIN
SHE SAID SHE WAS ILL IN BED AND PUT ME OFF TO ANOTHER DAY AND WHEN I GOT HOME I FOUND HER IN DIAMONDS AND SITTING WITH THAT VILLAIN ALONE
THAT GEORGE'S MATERNAL GRANDFATHER WAS BUT A WRETCHED OLD BANKRUPT AND DEPENDANT AND THAT JOHN SEDLEY MIGHT THANK THE MAN TO WHOM HE ALREADY OWED EVER SO MUCH MONEY
WERE DESTINED TO MEET WITH AN EXCEEDING GREAT REWARD A REWARD WHICH THOUGH CERTAINLY SOMEWHAT UNSUBSTANTIAL THE LITTLE WOMAN COVETED WITH GREATER EAGERNESS THAN MORE POSITIVE BENEFITS
THE MAN AS WAS VERY NOISY AND DRUNK INDEED SAYS NOTHING SHALL GO OUT OF THE HOUSE UNTIL HIS WAGES IS PAID UP THE ACCOUNT OF THIS LITTLE REVOLUTION IN MAY FAIR ASTONISHED
THE MAJOR FOLDED HIS ARMS ROUND HER HOLDING HER TO HIM AS IF SHE WAS A CHILD AND KISSED HER HEAD I WILL NOT CHANGE DEAR AMELIA HE SAID I ASK FOR NO MORE THAN YOUR LOVE
OR NOT TALKED ABOUT AT ALL HE LIVED COMFORTABLY ON CREDIT HE HAD A LARGE CAPITAL OF DEBTS WHICH LAID OUT JUDICIOUSLY WILL CARRY A MAN ALONG FOR MANY YEARS AND ON WHICH CERTAIN MEN ABOUT TOWN CONTRIVE TO LIVE A HUNDRED TIMES BETTER THAN EVEN MEN WITH READY MONEY CAN DO
MISTER MACMURDO HAD ALSO OCCASION TO TAKE OFF HIS SILK NIGHT CAP AND RUB IT ACROSS HIS EYES GO DOWN AND ORDER SOME BREAKFAST HE SAID TO HIS MAN IN A LOUD CHEERFUL VOICE WHAT'LL YOU HAVE CRAWLEY
WHO HAD NEVER KNOWN HER PERFORM SO WELL SHE SANG A FRENCH SONG WHICH JOSEPH DID NOT UNDERSTAND IN THE LEAST AND WHICH GEORGE CONFESSED HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND THEN A NUMBER OF THOSE SIMPLE BALLADS WHICH WERE THE FASHION FORTY YEARS AGO
HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HER IN AN IMPLORING ATTITUDE AND HIS HANDS BOUND IN A WEB OF GREEN SILK WHICH SHE WAS UNWINDING IN THIS ROMANTIC POSITION OSBORNE AND AMELIA FOUND THE INTERESTING PAIR
I WAS AFRAID YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT IT I VALUE IT MORE THAN ANYTHING I HAVE IN THE WORLD SAID AMELIA DO YOU AMELIA CRIED THE MAJOR THE FACT WAS AS HE HAD BOUGHT IT HIMSELF THOUGH HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT
A LITTLE SQUARE PIANO WHICH CAME DOWN FROM THE UPPER REGIONS OF THE HOUSE THE STATE GRAND PIANO HAVING BEEN DISPOSED OF PREVIOUSLY THIS THE YOUNG LADY TRIED WITH A RAPID AND SKILFUL HAND MAKING THE OFFICER BLUSH AND START AGAIN
IF YOU DON'T TURN OFF THAT ABOMINABLE SHEEP DOG SAID LORD STEYNE WITH A SAVAGE LOOK OVER HIS SHOULDER AT HER
THE LADIES NOT VERY BIG THEY WOULD HOLD THEIR TRAINS IN THEIR LAPS FINALLY THE FOUR WENT FRATERNALLY TOGETHER AND THEIR CARRIAGE PRESENTLY JOINED THE LINE OF ROYAL EQUIPAGES WHICH WAS MAKING ITS WAY DOWN PICCADILLY
PASSES SHOULD APPEAR ABROAD AT NIGHT ALONE IF EVEN CYNTHIA LOOKS HAGGARD OF AN AFTERNOON AS WE MAY SEE HER SOMETIMES IN THE PRESENT WINTER SEASON
AS IT MAY BE SEEN OF AN EARLY MORNING WHEN HALF THE LAMPS ARE OUT AND THE OTHERS ARE BLINKING WANLY AS IF THEY WERE ABOUT TO VANISH LIKE GHOSTS BEFORE THE DAWN SUCH CHARMS
NEVER WAS IN ACTION MY DEAR ASK MARTINGALE HE WAS IN SPAIN AIDE DE CAMP TO GENERAL BLAZES HE WAS A VERY KIND OLD MAN MISTER SEDLEY REBECCA SAID I'M REALLY SORRY HE'S GONE WRONG
AND WAS WAITING FOR HER HUSBAND IN THE ADJOINING DINING ROOM WITH FEMALE INSTINCT AUGURING EVIL THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM HAPPENED TO BE LEFT OPEN AND THE LADY OF COURSE WAS ISSUING FROM IT
THESE WERE ALL CHARMED WITH HER THE LITTLE DINNERS THE LAUGHING AND CHATTING THE MUSIC AFTERWARDS DELIGHTED ALL WHO PARTICIPATED IN THESE ENJOYMENTS
WHENCE YOU HEAR THE SOUND OF JINGLING SPINETS AND WOMEN SINGING WHERE LITTLE PORTER POTS HANG ON THE RAILINGS SUNNING THEMSELVES WHITHER OF EVENINGS YOU SEE CITY CLERKS PADDING WEARILY
FLING SOME WATER IN HIS FACE MISS SHARP OR CARRY HIM UPSTAIRS THE DEAR CREATURE'S FAINTING POOR VICTIM CARRY HIM UP HE'S AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER
SO THE CONVERSATION WENT ON I DON'T KNOW ON WHAT PRETEXT OSBORNE LEFT THE ROOM OR WHY PRESENTLY AMELIA WENT AWAY PERHAPS TO SUPERINTEND THE SLICING OF THE PINE APPLE
I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME THAT YOU WILL TAKE CHARGE OF HIM WHEN I'M GONE THAT DEAR GOOD WIFE OF YOURS HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD TO HIM AND HE'S FONDER OF HER THAN HE IS OF HIS DAMN IT LOOK HERE PITT
FOR ANY ONE WHO WANTS A PURSE REPLIED MISS REBECCA LOOKING AT HIM IN THE MOST GENTLE WINNING WAY SEDLEY WAS GOING TO MAKE ONE OF THE MOST ELOQUENT SPEECHES POSSIBLE AND HAD BEGUN
BONEY HIMSELF HASN'T GOT SUCH IN HIS CELLAR MY BOY A GOBLET OF CHAMPAGNE RESTORED JOSEPH'S EQUANIMITY AND BEFORE THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTIED OF WHICH AS AN INVALID HE TOOK TWO THIRDS HE HAD AGREED TO TAKE THE YOUNG LADIES TO VAUXHALL
THAT HE HAD BEEN TO SEE MISSUS GEORGE OSBORNE
THE HALL SWARMS WITH DINGY GUESTS OF ORIENTAL COUNTENANCE
O JOSEPH WE KNOW THAT STORY SAID AMELIA LAUGHING NEVER MIND ABOUT TELLING THAT BUT PERSUADE MAMMA TO WRITE TO SIR SOMETHING CRAWLEY FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR POOR DEAR REBECCA HERE SHE COMES HER EYES RED WITH WEEPING I'M BETTER NOW SAID THE GIRL WITH
WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED AT THIS REMARK THOUGH HE DREW HIS LEGS UNDER HIS CHAIR AS IT WAS MADE MISS SHARP SAID GEORGE OSBORNE YOU WHO ARE SO CLEVER AN ARTIST YOU MUST MAKE A GRAND HISTORICAL PICTURE OF THE SCENE OF THE BOOTS
I SAY MAC IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG IF I DROP I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO TO GO AND SEE HIM YOU KNOW AND SAY THAT I WAS VERY FOND OF HIM AND THAT
AND TO SUCH AN ANGEL AS HIM WHOM SHE HAD HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO MARRY WAS MARRIED FOREVER BUT SHE HAD NO OBJECTION TO HEAR THE MAJOR PRAISED
BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF HOW DELIGHTFUL IT WOULD BE TO HEAR SUCH SONGS AS THOSE AFTER CUTCHERRY WHAT A DISTINGUEE GIRL SHE WAS HOW SHE COULD SPEAK FRENCH BETTER THAN THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S LADY HERSELF
IN FACT WHEN HE DROVE INTO TOWN HE WAS AS FULL OF WINE BEER MEAT PICKLES CHERRY BRANDY AND TOBACCO AS THE STEWARD'S CABIN OF A STEAM PACKET IT WAS EVENING WHEN HIS CARRIAGE THUNDERED UP TO THE LITTLE DOOR IN BROMPTON
AFTER THE DEATH OF GEORGE OSBORNE ON THE PLATEAU AT MOUNT SAINT JOHN HE RECOVERED RALLIED RELAPSED AGAIN HAVING UNDERGONE SUCH A PROCESS OF BLOOD LETTING AND CALOMEL AS SHOWED THE STRENGTH OF HIS ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION
HIS GUN IN HIS HAND IS GOING TO THE CHASE IN THE DISTANCE A BANYHANN TREE AND A PAGODY MOST LIKELY RESEMBLANCES OF SOME INTERESTING SPOT IN OUR FAMOUS EASTERN POSSESSIONS HOW MUCH FOR THIS LOT COME GENTLEMEN
A HUNDRED YARDS OF MALINES LACE ROLLED ROUND THEM WORTH TWICE THE NUMBER OF GUINEAS BECKY COULD NOT HAVE REGARDED THEM WITH MORE PLEASURE YOU MAY BE SURE THEY OCCUPIED A CONSPICUOUS PLACE IN THE CHINA BOWL
TO DOUBT ANY MORE ABOUT HER VIRTUE I FOR MY PART LOOK BACK WITH LOVE AND AWE TO THAT GREAT CHARACTER IN HISTORY AH WHAT A HIGH AND NOBLE APPRECIATION OF GENTLEWOMANHOOD
HOW CUT UP YOUR PRETTY LITTLE FRIEND WILL BE HEY BECKY
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BUSINESS MY DEAR ANSWERED THE SIRE SHAKING HIS HEAD WITH AN IMPORTANT AIR AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT ON THIS POINT EMMY WAS VERY IGNORANT
PITT STOOPED AND PICKED THEM UP AMAZED AT SO MUCH WEALTH NOT THAT RAWDON SAID I HOPE TO PUT A BULLET INTO THE MAN WHOM THAT BELONGS TO
IT DOES NOT BECOME SUCH A FEEBLE AND INEXPERIENCED PEN AS MINE TO ATTEMPT TO RELATE THE DAZZLED EYES CLOSE BEFORE THAT MAGNIFICENT IDEA LOYAL RESPECT AND DECENCY TELL EVEN THE IMAGINATION NOT TO LOOK TOO KEENLY
WAS ONE OF THE DEFECTS OF THIS SILLY LITTLE THING GEORGE OSBORNE LOOKED AT THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN WITH A TOUCHED CURIOSITY AND JOSEPH SEDLEY HEAVED SOMETHING VERY LIKE A SIGH OUT OF HIS BIG CHEST
IN A MODEST DRESS WITH A VEIL ON WHIPPED OFF IN A HACKNEY COACH TO THE CITY AND BEING LANDED AT MESSRS JONES AND ROBINSON'S BANK
OR A MOUSE TO COME OUT AND PLAY ABOUT LATUDE'S
AND BREECHES AND SILK STOCKINGS SIMPERING ON A SOFA FROM UNDER HIS CURLY BROWN WIG SHE HAD HIM PAINTED IN A BROOCH AND WORE IT
THE OLD MAN WAS VERY MUCH AFFECTED SO OF COURSE WAS HIS DAUGHTER NOR WAS JOS WITHOUT FEELING IN THAT LONG ABSENCE OF TEN YEARS THE MOST SELFISH WILL THINK ABOUT HOME AND EARLY TIES DISTANCE SANCTIFIES BOTH
AMELIA HASTENED AFTER HER FRIEND TO KNOW THE CAUSE OF THIS DISPLAY OF FEELING AND THE GOOD NATURED GIRL CAME BACK WITHOUT HER COMPANION RATHER AFFECTED TOO YOU KNOW HER FATHER WAS OUR DRAWING MASTER MAMMA AT CHISWICK AND USED TO DO ALL THE BEST PARTS OF OUR DRAWINGS
THOSE TWO HAVE TOLD THEIRS AS SOON AS HE GETS HIS COMPANY SAID JOSEPH I BELIEVE THE AFFAIR IS SETTLED GEORGE OSBORNE IS A CAPITAL FELLOW AND YOUR SISTER THE DEAREST CREATURE IN THE WORLD SAID REBECCA
I KNOW THERE IS SOME ROUGE THAT WON'T COME OFF ON A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF AND SOME SO GOOD THAT EVEN TEARS WILL NOT DISTURB IT WELL SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN TWIDDLING ROUND HIS WIFE'S CARD YOU ARE BENT ON BECOMING A FINE LADY
COMING TO CALL A COUPLE OF HOURS AFTERWARDS AND LOOKING ABOUT HIM AND OBSERVING EVERYTHING AS WAS HIS WONT FOUND HIS LADIES CARDS ALREADY RANGED AS THE TRUMPS OF BECKY'S HAND AND GRINNED
WHEN MORNING CAME THE GOOD NATURED MISSUS SEDLEY NO LONGER THOUGHT OF EXECUTING HER THREATS WITH REGARD TO MISS SHARP FOR THOUGH NOTHING IS MORE KEEN NOR MORE COMMON NOR MORE JUSTIFIABLE THAN MATERNAL JEALOUSY
HE WAS RATHER DULL PERHAPS BUT WOULD NOT SUCH WINE MAKE ANY CONVERSATION PLEASANT WE MUST GET SOME OF HIS BURGUNDY AT ANY PRICE THE MOURNERS CRY AT HIS CLUB
YOU HAVE ONLY SOME OF THE BEST BLOOD IN ENGLAND IN YOUR VEINS AND GOOD PRINCIPLES AND PIETY FOR YOUR PORTION I MYSELF THE WIFE OF A BARONET'S YOUNGER BROTHER TOO NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING AS GOING TO COURT NOR WOULD OTHER PEOPLE
PUNCTUALLY AS THE SHRILL TONED BELL OF THE BLACK MARBLE STUDY CLOCK BEGAN TO CHIME NINE SIR PITT MADE HIS APPEARANCE FRESH NEAT SMUGLY SHAVED
WENT THROUGH THE COURT LAST WEEK AND WAS WHAT THEY CALL WHITEWASHED I BELIEVE LORD RAGLAND WOULD NOT PAY A SHILLING FOR HIM AND IT'S NOT MONEY I WANT RAWDON BROKE IN I'M NOT COME TO YOU ABOUT MYSELF
SO YOU KNOW SHE THE POOR CHILD IS ALL HEART SAID MISSUS SEDLEY I WISH SHE COULD STAY WITH US ANOTHER WEEK SAID AMELIA SHE'S DEVILISH LIKE MISS CUTLER THAT I USED TO MEET AT DUMDUM ONLY FAIRER
WHEN HE STAYED AT HOME SHE PLAYED AND SANG FOR HIM MADE HIM GOOD DRINKS SUPERINTENDED HIS DINNER WARMED HIS SLIPPERS AND STEEPED HIS SOUL IN COMFORT THE BEST OF WOMEN I HAVE HEARD MY GRANDMOTHER SAY ARE HYPOCRITES
ON THE STUDY TABLE AND AWAITING HIS JUDICIOUS SELECTION AND BY THE SERMON BOOK WAS THE OBSERVER NEWSPAPER DAMP AND NEATLY FOLDED AND FOR SIR PITT'S OWN PRIVATE USE
IS PLEASED SO TO HUMILIATE AND CAST DOWN THE TENDER GOOD AND WISE AND TO SET UP THE SELFISH THE FOOLISH OR THE WICKED OH BE HUMBLE MY BROTHER IN YOUR PROSPERITY BE GENTLE WITH THOSE WHO ARE LESS LUCKY IF NOT MORE DESERVING THINK WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO BE SCORNFUL
AND SAINT JAMES'S STREET TOWARDS THE OLD BRICK PALACE WHERE THE STAR OF BRUNSWICK WAS IN WAITING TO RECEIVE HIS NOBLES AND GENTLEFOLKS BECKY FELT AS IF SHE COULD BLESS THE PEOPLE OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOWS
TO WRAP A BALL IN THE NOTE AND KILL STEYNE WITH IT AFTER THIS COLLOQUY THE BROTHERS ONCE MORE SHOOK HANDS AND PARTED
AS YOU PASSED UP THE COMFORTABLE STAIR SOUNDED YOUR NAME FROM LANDING TO LANDING UNTIL IT REACHED THE APARTMENT WHERE JOLLY OLD DIVES WELCOMED HIS FRIENDS WHAT A NUMBER OF THEM HE HAD AND WHAT A NOBLE WAY OF ENTERTAINING THEM
AMELIA AS SHE READ OUT THE LETTER TO HER FATHER PAUSED OVER THE LATTER WORD HER BROTHER IT WAS CLEAR DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE FAMILY NOR COULD HE FOR THE FACT IS
BUT JOS WAS LEFT ALONE WITH REBECCA WHO HAD RESUMED HER WORK AND THE GREEN SILK AND THE SHINING NEEDLES WERE QUIVERING RAPIDLY UNDER HER WHITE SLENDER FINGERS WHAT A BEAUTIFUL
MISSUS RAWDON HAD FOUND THE LACE AND THE BROCADE IN OLD WARDROBES THE PROPERTY OF THE FORMER LADIES OF THE HOUSE AND HAD QUIETLY CARRIED THE GOODS HOME
OR WERE REPLACED BY THE GENTLE BUT UNROMANTIC MUSIC OF THE NOSE AND SAVE WHEN THE CHURCH BELLS TOLLED THE HOUR AND THE WATCHMAN CALLED IT ALL WAS SILENT AT THE HOUSE OF JOHN SEDLEY ESQUIRE OF RUSSELL SQUARE AND THE STOCK EXCHANGE
SAID THE COLLECTOR IT MADE ME CRY ALMOST PON MY HONOUR IT DID BECAUSE YOU HAVE A KIND HEART MISTER JOSEPH ALL THE SEDLEYS HAVE I THINK IT KEPT ME AWAKE LAST NIGHT AND I WAS TRYING TO HUM IT THIS MORNING IN BED
AND WE WENT TO VAUXHALL SINCE THEN I HAVE THOUGHT OF BUT ONE WOMAN IN THE WORLD AND THAT WAS YOU I THINK THERE IS NO HOUR IN THE DAY HAS PASSED FOR TWELVE YEARS THAT I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF YOU I CAME TO TELL YOU THIS BEFORE I WENT TO INDIA
EVERYTHING WAS PLENTIFUL IN HIS HOUSE BUT READY MONEY
WHOSE VIRTUE IS A DEFICIENCY OF TEMPTATION WHOSE SUCCESS MAY BE A CHANCE WHOSE RANK MAY BE AN ANCESTOR'S ACCIDENT WHOSE PROSPERITY IS VERY LIKELY A SATIRE THEY BURIED AMELIA'S MOTHER IN THE CHURCHYARD AT BROMPTON
AMELIA HAD BETTER WRITE A NOTE SAID HER FATHER AND LET GEORGE OSBORNE SEE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL HANDWRITING WE HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM MISS PINKERTON'S
MAJOR DOBBIN WAS EXCEEDINGLY PLEASED WHEN AS HE WAS SUPERINTENDING THE ARRANGEMENTS OF JOS'S NEW HOUSE WHICH THE MAJOR INSISTED SHOULD BE VERY HANDSOME AND COMFORTABLE THE CART ARRIVED FROM BROMPTON BRINGING THE TRUNKS AND
HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE HURRIEDLY THE PERSONAL CONFLICT WITH LORD STEYNE TO AN AFFAIR OF THAT NATURE OF COURSE HE SAID THERE WAS BUT ONE ISSUE
IT HAPPENED THAT THE ORATOR ON THE TABLE WAS EXPATIATING ON THE MERITS OF A PICTURE WHICH HE SOUGHT TO RECOMMEND TO HIS AUDIENCE IT WAS BY NO MEANS SO SELECT OR NUMEROUS A COMPANY AS HAD ATTENDED THE PREVIOUS DAYS OF THE AUCTION
THE MAJOR'S VISIT LEFT OLD JOHN SEDLEY IN A GREAT STATE OF AGITATION AND EXCITEMENT HIS DAUGHTER COULD NOT INDUCE HIM TO SETTLE DOWN TO HIS CUSTOMARY OCCUPATIONS OR AMUSEMENTS THAT NIGHT
HE DESCRIBED THE WHOLE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AND ALL BUT ANNOUNCED THAT NAPOLEON NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE TO SAINT HELENA AT ALL BUT FOR HIM JOS SEDLEY AFTER LEAVING SAINT HELENA HE BECAME VERY GENEROUS DISPOSING OF A GREAT QUANTITY OF SHIP STORES CLARET
AFTER THE FAILURE WAS ON THE RECEIPT OF THE PACKET OF FORKS AND SPOONS WITH THE YOUNG STOCKBROKERS LOVE OVER WHICH HE BURST OUT CRYING LIKE A CHILD BEING GREATLY MORE AFFECTED THAN EVEN HIS WIFE TO WHOM THE PRESENT WAS ADDRESSED EDWARD DALE
OTHERWISE HE WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF SUNDAY PAPERS INTO HIS HOUSEHOLD THE THEATRICAL CRITICISMS THE FIGHT FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS A SIDE BETWEEN THE BARKING BUTCHER
SOSPIRI AND FELICITA OF THE ETERNAL DONIZETTIAN MUSIC WITH WHICH WE ARE FAVOURED NOW A DAYS CONVERSATION OF A SENTIMENTAL SORT BEFITTING THE SUBJECT WAS CARRIED ON BETWEEN THE SONGS TO WHICH SAMBO AFTER HE HAD BROUGHT THE TEA
I RECOLLECT SEEING YEARS AGO AT THE PRISONS FOR IDIOTS AND MADMEN AT BICETRE NEAR PARIS A POOR WRETCH BENT DOWN UNDER THE BONDAGE OF HIS IMPRISONMENT AND HIS PERSONAL INFIRMITY
FELT THE GREATEST INTEREST IN JACK SPATTERDASH WHOSE CAB HORSE HAD COME DOWN AND BOB MARTINGALE
I WISH I WAS RAWDON REPLIED IF IT WASN'T FOR LITTLE RAWDON I'D HAVE CUT MY THROAT THIS MORNING AND THAT DAMNED VILLAIN'S TOO
SOME FAINTED WITH EMOTION PEOPLE WERE SUFFOCATED IN THE PIT SHRIEKS AND GROANS RISING UP AMIDST THE WRITHING AND SHOUTING MASS THERE OF HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE AND INDEED SHOWED THEMSELVES ALMOST TO BE READY TO DIE FOR HIM
O YOU POOR SECRET MARTYRS AND VICTIMS WHOSE LIFE IS A TORTURE WHO ARE STRETCHED ON RACKS IN YOUR BEDROOMS AND WHO LAY YOUR HEADS DOWN ON THE BLOCK DAILY AT THE DRAWING ROOM TABLE
SHE BROUGHT EVERYBODY TO THE HOUSE AND SHE MADE JOS BELIEVE THAT IT WAS HIS OWN GREAT SOCIAL TALENTS AND WIT
THOUGHT HE COULD NOT GO TO TOWN UNTIL HE WAS SUPPLIED WITH ONE OR TWO OF THESE GARMENTS AND SELECTED A CRIMSON SATIN EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD BUTTERFLIES AND A BLACK AND RED VELVET TARTAN WITH WHITE STRIPES AND A ROLLING COLLAR
THE AUCTIONEER SAID MISTER LEWIS TWENTY FIVE AND MISTER LEWIS'S CHIEF THUS BECAME THE PROPRIETOR OF THE LITTLE SQUARE PIANO HAVING EFFECTED THE PURCHASE HE SATE UP AS IF HE WAS GREATLY RELIEVED AND THE UNSUCCESSFUL COMPETITORS CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF HIM AT THIS MOMENT
RANSACKED BY BROKERS AND BARGAINERS AND ITS QUIET FAMILY TREASURES GIVEN UP TO PUBLIC DESECRATION AND PLUNDER A MONTH AFTER HER FLIGHT
IN THESE CONVERSATIONS IT WAS WONDERFUL WITH WHAT PERSEVERANCE AND INGENUITY MAJOR DOBBIN WOULD MANAGE TO BRING THE TALK ROUND TO THE SUBJECT OF AMELIA AND HER LITTLE BOY
ANSWERED MISSUS RAWDON PLAINTIVELY AND SHE RUBBED HER CHEEK WITH HER HANDKERCHIEF AS IF TO SHOW THERE WAS NO ROUGE AT ALL ONLY GENUINE BLUSHES AND MODESTY IN HER CASE ABOUT THIS WHO CAN TELL
SHUDDERING IN A SHAWL ON THE BOX
ON THE DRAWING ROOM TABLE WHERE BECKY KEPT THE CARDS OF HER VISITORS
SHE TALKED TO HER PERPETUALLY ABOUT MAJOR DOBBIN SENT ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND MADE NO SCRUPLE OF DECLARING HER ADMIRATION FOR THAT EXCELLENT HIGH MINDED GENTLEMAN
OR PUBLISHED IN THE MORNING POST ALL HIS CREDITORS WOULD HAVE COME RUSHING ON HIM IN A BODY HAD THEY KNOWN THAT HE WAS UNITED TO A WOMAN WITHOUT FORTUNE
ON THE CONTRARY WITH SOMETHING AKIN TO GRATITUDE AMELIA TOOK THE CRUMBS THAT HER FATHER IN LAW LET DROP NOW AND THEN AND WITH THEM FED HER OWN PARENT DIRECTLY SHE UNDERSTOOD IT TO BE HER DUTY IT WAS THIS YOUNG WOMAN'S NATURE
AH WHAT SHALL I DO LORD STEYNE FOR I AM VERY VERY UNHAPPY LORD STEYNE MADE NO REPLY EXCEPT BY BEATING THE DEVIL'S TATTOO AND BITING HIS NAILS AT LAST HE CLAPPED HIS HAT ON HIS HEAD AND FLUNG OUT OF THE ROOM
AND OVER WHICH THE LATE MISTER GEORGE ROBINS USED TO PRESIDE WITH SO MUCH DIGNITY THERE ARE VERY FEW LONDON PEOPLE AS I FANCY WHO HAVE NOT ATTENDED AT THESE MEETINGS AND ALL WITH A TASTE FOR MORALIZING MUST HAVE THOUGHT
DURING WHICH REBECCA WAS LEFT TO THE SOCIETY OF MISTER JOSEPH
THIS DONE JOS WENT ON AT THE BOARDING HOUSE AT CHELTENHAM PRETTY MUCH AS BEFORE HE DROVE HIS CURRICLE HE DRANK HIS CLARET HE PLAYED HIS RUBBER HE TOLD HIS INDIAN STORIES
THE NEXT TIME THAT OLD SEDLEY ASKED HER TO PLAY SHE SAID IT WAS SHOCKINGLY OUT OF TUNE THAT SHE HAD A HEADACHE THAT SHE COULDN'T PLAY THEN ACCORDING TO HER CUSTOM SHE REBUKED HERSELF
HE COULD ENJOY HIS HOOKAH THERE WITH SUCH PERFECT EASE AND COULD SWAGGER DOWN TO THE THEATRES WHEN MINDED SO AGREEABLY THAT PERHAPS HE WOULD HAVE REMAINED ALTOGETHER AT THE SLAUGHTERS HAD NOT HIS FRIEND THE MAJOR BEEN AT HIS ELBOW
SIR PITT INSTANTLY GUESSED THE TRUTH AND SURMISED THAT LORD STEYNE WAS THE PERSON WHOSE LIFE RAWDON WISHED TO TAKE THE COLONEL TOLD HIS SENIOR BRIEFLY AND IN BROKEN ACCENTS
AS LONG A TIME AT HIS TOILETTE AS ANY FADING BEAUTY THE YOUNGSTERS AMONG THE PASSENGERS YOUNG CHAFFERS OF THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTIETH AND POOR LITTLE RICKETTS COMING HOME AFTER HIS THIRD FEVER USED TO DRAW OUT SEDLEY AT THE CUDDY TABLE
THE VERY THOUGHT OF THEM IS ODIOUS AND LOW THERE MUST BE CLASSES THERE MUST BE RICH AND POOR DIVES SAYS SMACKING HIS CLARET
AND THERE'S ONLY A WAY OUT OF IT FOR ONE OF US MAC DO YOU UNDERSTAND I WAS PUT OUT OF THE WAY ARRESTED I FOUND EM ALONE TOGETHER
A MODEL OF NEATNESS AND EVERY PROPRIETY HE STARTED WHEN HE SAW POOR RAWDON IN HIS STUDY IN TUMBLED CLOTHES WITH BLOOD SHOT EYES AND HIS HAIR OVER HIS FACE
INSPIRITING MISTER MOSS INTO ACTION IMPLORING COMMANDING BELLOWING
PRETTY THING IS IT NOT SWEET MINIATURE
SHE'S BEEN MAKING A PURSE FOR HERSELF ALL THE TIME AND GRUDGED ME A HUNDRED POUND TO GET ME OUT OF QUOD HE THEN FIERCELY AND INCOHERENTLY AND WITH AN AGITATION
MESSRS JONES AND ROBINSON'S
OF STEWED EELS VEAL CUTLETS AND FRENCH BEANS WITH A BOTTLE OF CLARET HE WAS COLD OVER BAGSHOT HEATH WHERE THE NATIVE CHATTERED MORE AND MORE
AND ACTUALLY HAD THE AUDACITY TO ASK MISS REBECCA FOR WHOM SHE WAS KNITTING THE GREEN SILK PURSE HE WAS QUITE SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED AT HIS OWN GRACEFUL FAMILIAR MANNER
BANDBOXES OF THE EMIGRANTS FROM THAT VILLAGE AND WITH THEM THE OLD PIANO AMELIA WOULD HAVE IT UP IN HER SITTING ROOM A NEAT LITTLE APARTMENT ON THE SECOND FLOOR ADJOINING HER FATHER'S CHAMBER AND WHERE THE OLD GENTLEMAN SAT COMMONLY OF EVENINGS
HIS SCANTY HAIR COMBED AND OILED TRIMMING HIS NAILS AS HE DESCENDED THE STAIRS MAJESTICALLY IN A STARCHED CRAVAT AND A GREY FLANNEL DRESSING GOWN A REAL OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN IN A WORD
BUT I'VE NO PATIENCE WITH JOS AND HIS DANDIFIED MODESTY IT IS OUT JOSEPHING JOSEPH MY DEAR AND ALL THE WHILE THE BOY IS ONLY THINKING OF HIMSELF AND WHAT A FINE FELLOW HE IS I DOUBT MA'AM WE SHALL HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH HIM YET
TREMBLING AND COAXING WITH SMILES THE HUSBAND BY YOUR SIDE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE NEW VELVET GOWN FROM THE OLD ONE OR THE NEW BRACELET FROM LAST YEAR'S OR HAS ANY NOTION THAT THE RAGGED LOOKING YELLOW LACE SCARF COST FORTY GUINEAS
SHE DID NOT RESPECT HERSELF ANY MORE THAN THE WORLD RESPECTED HER BUT I BELIEVE THOUGHT IN HER HEART THAT SHE WAS A POOR SPIRITED DESPICABLE LITTLE CREATURE WHOSE LUCK IN LIFE WAS ONLY TOO GOOD FOR HER MERITS O YOU POOR WOMEN
WITH WHICH AND LEAVING THE COLONEL TO DRESS HIMSELF MACMURDO TURNED ROUND TOWARDS THE WALL AND RESUMED THE PERUSAL OF BELL'S LIFE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HIS FRIEND'S TOILETTE WAS COMPLETE
THESE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED BECKY PAID A VISIT UPSTAIRS TO THE BEFORE MENTIONED DESK WHICH AMELIA SEDLEY HAD GIVEN HER YEARS AND YEARS AGO AND WHICH CONTAINED A NUMBER OF USEFUL AND VALUABLE LITTLE THINGS IN WHICH PRIVATE MUSEUM SHE PLACED THE ONE NOTE WHICH
YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD SUPERB DIAMONDS FORSOOTH AND HAVE BEEN PRESENTED AT COURT BY YOUR COUSIN THE LADY JANE
AND THE PUBLICAN SHUTTING HIS SHUTTERS IN THE SUNSHINE AGAINST SERVICE COMMENCED THE PEOPLE JOKED AT THE CAB STAND ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE AS HE TOOK A CARRIAGE THERE
THOUGH I WISHED AND PRAYED FOR YOU TO COME AND THEY TOOK HIM TOO AWAY FROM ME ISN'T HE A NOBLE BOY WILLIAM BE HIS FRIEND STILL AND MINE AND HERE HER VOICE BROKE AND SHE HID HER FACE ON HIS SHOULDER
HIS SERVANTS WHO ACCOMPANIED HIM BROUGHT HIM TO THE HOUSE OF THE FRIEND WITH WHOM HE HAD RESOLVED TO STAY UNTIL HIS DEPARTURE FOR EUROPE IN A STATE OF DELIRIUM AND IT WAS THOUGHT FOR MANY MANY DAYS THAT HE WOULD NEVER TRAVEL FARTHER THAN THE BURYING GROUND OF THE CHURCH OF SAINT GEORGE'S
ANNA MARIA ROAD WEST WHERE THE HOUSES LOOK LIKE BABY HOUSES WHERE THE PEOPLE LOOKING OUT OF THE FIRST FLOOR WINDOWS MUST INFALLIBLY AS YOU THINK SIT WITH THEIR FEET IN THE PARLOURS
BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT IT WAS THE FIRST GENTLEMAN IN EUROPE IN WHOSE HIGH PRESENCE MISSUS RAWDON PASSED HER EXAMINATION AND AS IT WERE TOOK HER DEGREE IN REPUTATION IT SURELY MUST BE FLAT DISLOYALTY
I HAVE TO BEG YOUR PARDON FOR SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT SAID HE ABOUT ABOUT THAT LITTLE SQUARE PIANO I NEVER THANKED YOU FOR IT WHEN YOU GAVE IT ME MANY MANY YEARS AGO BEFORE I WAS MARRIED I THOUGHT SOMEBODY ELSE HAD GIVEN IT
NO THERE WAS NOT AND THE CHILIS
AND HER NIECE AS THEY WERE TAKING EARLY TEA AND HOT BUTTERED TOAST IN THE FORMER LADY'S APARTMENT AND WONDERED HOW THE RAWDING CRAWLEYS COULD GIT ON THE VALET HAD DAMPED AND FOLDED THE PAPER ONCE MORE
AND IN THESE MEDITATIONS HE FELL ASLEEP HOW MISS SHARP LAY AWAKE THINKING WILL HE COME OR NOT TO MORROW NEED NOT BE TOLD HERE
WHICH WAS NOT NEARLY SO GOOD AND THEN EXAMINING THE QUALITY OF THE ANCIENT BROCADE WHICH FORMED THE MATERIAL OF MISSUS RAWDON'S COURT DRESS SHE FELT INCLINED TO SAY THAT SHE COULD NOT AFFORD SUCH FINE CLOTHING BUT CHECKED THAT SPEECH WITH AN EFFORT
WHY YOU SILLY MAN SHE CONTINUED WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE I GOT THEM ALL EXCEPT THE LITTLE CLASP WHICH A DEAR FRIEND OF MINE GAVE ME LONG AGO I HIRED THEM TO BE SURE I HIRED THEM AT MISTER POLONIUS'S IN COVENTRY STREET
WHO WAS WATCHING FROM HIS GREENGROCER'S SHOP AND SAW FINE PLUMES WITHIN AND ENORMOUS BUNCHES OF FLOWERS IN THE BREASTS OF THE NEW LIVERY COATS OF THE FOOTMEN SIR PITT IN A GLITTERING UNIFORM
AND SHE WAS QUITE CONTENTED TO WAIT UNTIL THE OLD AUNT SHOULD BE RECONCILED BEFORE SHE CLAIMED HER PLACE IN SOCIETY SO SHE LIVED AT BROMPTON AND MEANWHILE SAW NO ONE
THE GIRLS MUST HAVE A GENTLEMAN APIECE SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN JOS WILL BE SURE TO LEAVE EMMY IN THE CROWD
LAUGHABLE AND TEARFUL WHERE YOU MAY BE GENTLE AND PATHETIC OR SAVAGE AND CYNICAL WITH PERFECT PROPRIETY IT IS AT ONE OF THOSE PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES A CROWD OF WHICH ARE ADVERTISED EVERY DAY IN THE LAST PAGE OF THE TIMES NEWSPAPER
MY LOVE I'M SURE I ALWAYS HEARD MISS PINKERTON SAY THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH THEM HE ONLY MOUNTED THEM IT WAS CALLED MOUNTING MAMMA REBECCA REMEMBERS THE DRAWING AND HER FATHER WORKING AT IT AND THE THOUGHT OF IT CAME UPON HER RATHER SUDDENLY AND
ROARED MISTER HAMMERDOWN PORTRAIT OF A GENTLEMAN ON AN ELEPHANT WHO'LL BID FOR THE GENTLEMAN ON THE ELEPHANT LIFT UP THE PICTURE BLOWMAN AND LET THE COMPANY EXAMINE THIS LOT A LONG PALE MILITARY LOOKING GENTLEMAN
EXPRESSED TO HIM BUT HAD FELT FOR HIS PIANO A FEW DAYS AFTERWARDS AS THEY WERE SEATED IN THE DRAWING ROOM WHERE JOS HAD FALLEN ASLEEP WITH GREAT COMFORT AFTER DINNER AMELIA SAID WITH RATHER A FALTERING VOICE TO MAJOR DOBBIN
AND I'VE ALWAYS FELT ASHAMED OF HAVING TAKEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN'S MONEY AND HERE'S SOME MORE I'VE ONLY KEPT BACK A FEW POUNDS WHICH BECKY MAY AS WELL HAVE
WHICH OTHERS ARE SLOW TO PERCEIVE HOW FOR INSTANCE COMUS FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT HE IS THE GREATEST TRAGIC ACTOR IN ENGLAND HOW BROWN THE FAMOUS NOVELIST LONGS TO BE CONSIDERED NOT A MAN OF GENIUS BUT A MAN OF FASHION
AND TO TRIP DOWN AGAIN TO WAIT UPON THE GREAT PEER SHE FOUND HIM GRINNING OVER THE BOWL SHE WAS DISCOVERED AND SHE BLUSHED A LITTLE THANK YOU MONSEIGNEUR SHE SAID
AND MAKE THEIR CURTSEY TO THE SOVEREIGN UNDER THE PROTECTION OF LAMPLIGHT OUR BELOVED REBECCA HAD NO NEED HOWEVER OF ANY SUCH A FRIENDLY HALO TO SET OFF HER BEAUTY
RELENTED AND ONLY DELIVERED IN A COUPLE OF CARDS ON WHICH WERE ENGRAVEN THE NAMES OF THE MARCHIONESS OF STEYNE AND THE COUNTESS OF GAUNT IF THESE BITS OF PASTEBOARD
NOT IT MUST BE OWNED OF THE VERY HIGHEST REPUTATION IN VANITY FAIR
DOBBIN BECAME SO IMPATIENT AND ILL HUMOURED AS TO SURPRISE THOSE COMRADES WHO HAD BEFORE ADMIRED HIS VIVACITY AND GOOD TEMPER HE DID NOT RECOVER UNTIL THE BREEZE SPRANG UP AGAIN AND WAS IN A HIGHLY EXCITED STATE WHEN THE PILOT CAME ON BOARD
BUT HIS HANDS SHOOK AND HE WAS SO AGITATED THAT THE POCKET BOOK FELL FROM HIM AND OUT OF IT THE THOUSAND POUND NOTE WHICH HAD BEEN THE LAST OF THE UNLUCKY BECKY'S WINNINGS
WHY MIRANDA WAS EVEN VERY KIND TO CALIBAN AND WE MAY BE PRETTY SURE FOR THE SAME REASON NOT THAT SHE WOULD ENCOURAGE HIM IN THE LEAST THE POOR UNCOUTH MONSTER OF COURSE NOT NO MORE WOULD EMMY BY ANY MEANS ENCOURAGE HER ADMIRER THE MAJOR
O STOCKBROKERS BANKRUPTS USED TO IT YOU KNOW RAWDON REPLIED CUTTING A FLY OFF THE HORSE'S EAR
RAWDON DISPATCHED CAPTAIN MACMURDO'S SERVANT TO CURZON STREET WITH AN ORDER TO THE DOMESTIC THERE TO GIVE UP A BAG OF CLOTHES OF WHICH THE COLONEL HAD GREAT NEED AND DURING THE MAN'S ABSENCE
YOU ARE NOT SO GOOD TO ME AS DEAR AMELIA HE DOESN'T KNOW YOU SO WELL CRIED AMELIA I DEFY ANYBODY NOT TO BE GOOD TO YOU MY DEAR SAID HER MOTHER THE CURRY WAS CAPITAL INDEED IT WAS SAID JOE QUITE GRAVELY
TO GET ON WITH AS HE SPOKE
