I DO NOT INTEND TO HURT YOU LISTEN TO ME
TO HAVE DISCOVERED MYSELF TO THE REST OF HIS FAMILY WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR MY APPROACH
BE HERS THE PUNISHMENT THANKS TO THE LESSONS OF FELIX AND THE SANGUINARY LAWS OF MAN I HAD LEARNED NOW TO WORK MISCHIEF I BENT OVER HER
AND SHOULD I FEEL KINDNESS TOWARDS MY ENEMIES NO FROM THAT MOMENT I DECLARED EVERLASTING WAR AGAINST THE SPECIES AND MORE THAN ALL AGAINST HIM WHO HAD FORMED ME
ON YOUR SOLEMN OATH TO QUIT EUROPE FOREVER AND EVERY OTHER PLACE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AS SOON AS I SHALL DELIVER INTO YOUR HANDS A FEMALE WHO WILL ACCOMPANY YOU IN YOUR EXILE I SWEAR HE CRIED BY THE SUN
I KNEW THAT I OUGHT TO HASTEN MY DESCENT TOWARDS THE VALLEY AS I SHOULD SOON BE ENCOMPASSED IN DARKNESS BUT MY HEART WAS HEAVY AND MY STEPS SLOW THE LABOUR OF WINDING AMONG THE LITTLE PATHS OF THE MOUNTAIN
THAT YOU WERE MY FATHER MY CREATOR AND TO WHOM COULD I APPLY WITH MORE FITNESS THAN TO HIM WHO HAD GIVEN ME LIFE AMONG THE LESSONS THAT FELIX HAD BESTOWED UPON SAFIE GEOGRAPHY HAD NOT BEEN OMITTED
IMMENSE RECESSES CONSUMED BY A BURNING PASSION WHICH YOU ALONE CAN GRATIFY WE MAY NOT PART UNTIL YOU HAVE PROMISED TO COMPLY WITH MY REQUISITION I AM ALONE AND MISERABLE
INSTEAD OF VENTING MY SENSATIONS IN EXCLAMATIONS AND AGONY I DID NOT RUSH AMONG MANKIND AND PERISH IN THE ATTEMPT TO DESTROY THEM WHILE I WAS OVERCOME BY THESE FEELINGS I LEFT THE SPOT WHERE I HAD COMMITTED THE MURDER AND SEEKING A MORE SECLUDED HIDING PLACE
HERE I PAUSED NOT EXACTLY KNOWING WHAT PATH TO PURSUE WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES
AND I FOUND NO SHELTER OH EARTH HOW OFTEN DID I IMPRECATE CURSES ON THE CAUSE OF MY BEING
OF PLEASURE BUT MY TOILS NOW DREW NEAR A CLOSE AND IN TWO MONTHS FROM THIS TIME I REACHED THE ENVIRONS OF GENEVA IT WAS EVENING WHEN I ARRIVED AND I RETIRED TO A HIDING PLACE AMONG THE FIELDS THAT SURROUND IT
ALREADY SHOWN A DEGREE OF MALICE THAT SHOULD REASONABLY MAKE ME DISTRUST YOU MAY NOT EVEN THIS BE A FEINT THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR TRIUMPH BY AFFORDING A WIDER SCOPE FOR YOUR REVENGE HOW IS THIS
IT WAS A PORTRAIT OF A MOST LOVELY WOMAN IN SPITE OF MY MALIGNITY IT SOFTENED AND ATTRACTED ME FOR A FEW MOMENTS I GAZED WITH DELIGHT ON HER DARK EYES
BUT IT IS ALL THAT I CAN RECEIVE AND IT SHALL CONTENT ME IT IS TRUE WE SHALL BE MONSTERS CUT OFF FROM ALL THE WORLD BUT ON THAT ACCOUNT WE SHALL BE MORE ATTACHED TO ONE ANOTHER
I HAD NO MEANS OF EXTRACTING IT MY SUFFERINGS WERE AUGMENTED ALSO BY THE OPPRESSIVE SENSE OF THE INJUSTICE AND INGRATITUDE OF THEIR INFLICTION MY DAILY VOWS ROSE FOR REVENGE A DEEP AND DEADLY REVENGE
I CREPT FORTH FROM MY HIDING PLACE AND WENT IN SEARCH OF FOOD WHEN MY HUNGER WAS APPEASED I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THE WELL KNOWN PATH THAT CONDUCTED TO THE COTTAGE ALL THERE WAS AT PEACE
I GAZED ON MY VICTIM AND MY HEART SWELLED WITH EXULTATION AND HELLISH TRIUMPH CLAPPING MY HANDS I EXCLAIMED I TOO CAN CREATE DESOLATION MY ENEMY IS NOT INVULNERABLE
BUT I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW THE ETERNAL TWINKLING OF THE STARS WEIGHED UPON ME AND HOW I LISTENED TO EVERY BLAST OF WIND AS IF IT WERE A DULL UGLY SIROC ON ITS WAY TO CONSUME ME MORNING DAWNED BEFORE I ARRIVED AT THE VILLAGE OF
WHICH DIFFERED FROM THAT OF MY PROTECTORS SOON AFTER HOWEVER FELIX APPROACHED WITH ANOTHER MAN I WAS SURPRISED AS I KNEW THAT HE HAD NOT QUITTED THE COTTAGE THAT MORNING
I WAS SCARCELY HID WHEN A YOUNG GIRL CAME RUNNING TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE I WAS CONCEALED LAUGHING AS IF SHE RAN FROM SOMEONE IN SPORT
AND WHY DO YOU AGAIN HARDEN YOURSELF TO MY COMPLAINTS I SWEAR TO YOU BY THE EARTH WHICH I INHABIT AND BY YOU THAT MADE ME THAT WITH THE COMPANION YOU BESTOW I WILL QUIT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AND DWELL AS IT MAY CHANCE
FOREVER ACTING BEFORE MY EYES THE FEMALES WERE FLYING AND THE ENRAGED FELIX TEARING ME FROM HIS FATHER'S FEET I AWOKE EXHAUSTED
I COULD NO LONGER SUPPRESS THE RAGE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME I DO REFUSE IT I REPLIED AND NO TORTURE SHALL EVER EXTORT A CONSENT FROM ME YOU MAY RENDER ME THE MOST MISERABLE OF MEN BUT YOU SHALL NEVER MAKE ME BASE IN MY OWN EYES
BUT THAT WHEN YOU ARE READY I SHALL APPEAR SAYING THIS HE SUDDENLY QUITTED ME FEARFUL PERHAPS OF ANY CHANGE IN MY SENTIMENTS I SAW HIM DESCEND THE MOUNTAIN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN THE FLIGHT OF AN EAGLE
I DO NOT WISH TO TAKE ANY UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AND I BEG THEREFORE THAT YOU WILL TAKE SOME DAYS TO CONSIDER OF YOUR DETERMINATION IT IS UTTERLY USELESS REPLIED FELIX WE CAN NEVER AGAIN INHABIT YOUR COTTAGE THE LIFE OF MY FATHER IS IN THE GREATEST DANGER
MY WIFE AND MY SISTER WILL NEVER RECOVER FROM THEIR HORROR I ENTREAT YOU NOT TO REASON WITH ME ANY MORE TAKE POSSESSION OF YOUR TENEMENT AND LET ME FLY FROM THIS PLACE FELIX TREMBLED VIOLENTLY AS HE SAID THIS
UGLY WRETCH YOU WISH TO EAT ME AND TEAR ME TO PIECES YOU ARE AN OGRE LET ME GO OR I WILL TELL MY PAPA BOY YOU WILL NEVER SEE YOUR FATHER AGAIN YOU MUST COME WITH ME HIDEOUS MONSTER LET ME GO
NOT I BUT SHE SHALL SUFFER THE MURDER I HAVE COMMITTED BECAUSE I AM FOREVER ROBBED OF ALL THAT SHE COULD GIVE ME SHE SHALL ATONE THE CRIME HAD ITS SOURCE IN HER
AND CONTINUED IF YOU CONSENT NEITHER YOU NOR ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING SHALL EVER SEE US AGAIN I WILL GO TO THE VAST WILDS OF SOUTH AMERICA MY FOOD IS NOT THAT OF MAN
THIS DEATH WILL CARRY DESPAIR TO HIM AND A THOUSAND OTHER MISERIES SHALL TORMENT AND DESTROY HIM AS I FIXED MY EYES ON THE CHILD I SAW SOMETHING GLITTERING ON HIS BREAST I TOOK IT
HE WILL PUNISH YOU YOU DARE NOT KEEP ME FRANKENSTEIN YOU BELONG THEN TO MY ENEMY TO HIM TOWARDS WHOM I HAVE SWORN ETERNAL REVENGE YOU SHALL BE MY FIRST VICTIM
THE CHILD STILL STRUGGLED AND LOADED ME WITH EPITHETS WHICH CARRIED DESPAIR TO MY HEART I GRASPED HIS THROAT TO SILENCE HIM AND IN A MOMENT HE LAY DEAD AT MY FEET
SHALL I RESPECT MAN WHEN HE CONDEMNS ME LET HIM LIVE WITH ME IN THE INTERCHANGE OF KINDNESS AND INSTEAD OF INJURY I WOULD BESTOW EVERY BENEFIT UPON HIM WITH TEARS OF GRATITUDE AT HIS ACCEPTANCE
THUS I RETURNED HOME AND ENTERING THE HOUSE PRESENTED MYSELF TO THE FAMILY MY HAGGARD AND WILD APPEARANCE AWOKE INTENSE ALARM BUT I ANSWERED NO QUESTION SCARCELY DID I SPEAK
AND FIXING MY FEET FIRMLY AS I ADVANCED PERPLEXED ME OCCUPIED AS I WAS BY THE EMOTIONS WHICH THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY HAD PRODUCED NIGHT WAS FAR ADVANCED WHEN I CAME TO THE HALFWAY RESTING PLACE AND SEATED MYSELF BESIDE THE FOUNTAIN
AND AFTER HAVING DESTROYED EVERY VESTIGE OF CULTIVATION IN THE GARDEN I WAITED WITH FORCED IMPATIENCE UNTIL THE MOON HAD SUNK TO COMMENCE MY OPERATIONS AS THE NIGHT ADVANCED A FIERCE WIND
AND INSTEAD OF THREATENING I AM CONTENT TO REASON WITH YOU I AM MALICIOUS BECAUSE I AM MISERABLE AM I NOT SHUNNED AND HATED BY ALL MANKIND
I DO NOT DESTROY THE LAMB AND THE KID TO GLUT MY APPETITE ACORNS AND BERRIES AFFORD ME SUFFICIENT NOURISHMENT MY COMPANION WILL BE OF THE SAME NATURE AS MYSELF AND WILL BE CONTENT WITH THE SAME FARE WE SHALL MAKE OUR BED OF DRIED LEAVES
AND TO SAVE THEM I RESOLVED TO DEDICATE MYSELF TO MY MOST ABHORRED TASK THE PROSPECT OF SUCH AN OCCUPATION MADE EVERY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE OF EXISTENCE PASS BEFORE ME LIKE A DREAM
I BECAME FATIGUED WITH EXCESS OF BODILY EXERTION AND SANK ON THE DAMP GRASS IN THE SICK IMPOTENCE OF DESPAIR THERE WAS NONE AMONG THE MYRIADS OF MEN
I THOUGHT OF THE PROMISE OF VIRTUES WHICH HE HAD DISPLAYED ON THE OPENING OF HIS EXISTENCE AND THE SUBSEQUENT BLIGHT OF ALL KINDLY FEELING BY THE LOATHING AND SCORN WHICH HIS PROTECTORS HAD MANIFESTED TOWARDS HIM HIS POWER AND THREATS
I MUST NOT BE TRIFLED WITH AND I DEMAND AN ANSWER IF I HAVE NO TIES AND NO AFFECTIONS HATRED AND VICE MUST BE MY PORTION THE LOVE OF ANOTHER WILL DESTROY THE CAUSE OF MY CRIMES
AND I SHALL BECOME A THING OF WHOSE EXISTENCE EVERYONE WILL BE IGNORANT MY VICES ARE THE CHILDREN OF A FORCED SOLITUDE THAT I ABHOR AND MY VIRTUES WILL
BUT HOW WAS I TO DIRECT MYSELF I KNEW THAT I MUST TRAVEL IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION TO REACH MY DESTINATION BUT THE SUN WAS MY ONLY GUIDE I DID NOT KNOW THE NAMES OF THE TOWNS THAT I WAS TO PASS THROUGH NOR COULD I ASK
THE SUN WILL SHINE ON US AS ON MAN AND WILL RIPEN OUR FOOD THE PICTURE I PRESENT TO YOU IS PEACEFUL AND HUMAN AND YOU MUST FEEL THAT YOU COULD DENY IT ONLY IN THE WANTONNESS OF POWER AND CRUELTY
AND BY THE BLUE SKY OF HEAVEN AND BY THE FIRE OF LOVE THAT BURNS MY HEART THAT IF YOU GRANT MY PRAYER WHILE THEY EXIST YOU SHALL NEVER BEHOLD ME AGAIN DEPART TO YOUR HOME AND COMMENCE YOUR LABOURS
NO INCIDENT OCCURRED FROM WHICH MY RAGE AND MISERY COULD NOT EXTRACT ITS FOOD BUT A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAPPENED WHEN I ARRIVED ON THE CONFINES OF SWITZERLAND
AND A GUSH OF TEARS SOMEWHAT SOOTHED ME BUT AGAIN WHEN I REFLECTED THAT THEY HAD SPURNED AND DESERTED ME ANGER RETURNED A RAGE OF ANGER
IF THEREFORE I COULD SEIZE HIM AND EDUCATE HIM AS MY COMPANION AND FRIEND I SHOULD NOT BE SO DESOLATE IN THIS PEOPLED EARTH URGED BY THIS IMPULSE I SEIZED ON THE BOY AS HE PASSED AND DREW HIM TOWARDS ME
MAN WILL NOT ASSOCIATE WITH ME BUT ONE AS DEFORMED AND HORRIBLE AS MYSELF WOULD NOT DENY HERSELF TO ME MY COMPANION MUST BE OF THE SAME SPECIES AND HAVE THE SAME DEFECTS
BUT OF AN AGREEABLE ASPECT AND BLOOMING IN THE LOVELINESS OF YOUTH AND HEALTH HERE I THOUGHT IS ONE OF THOSE WHOSE JOY IMPARTING SMILES ARE BESTOWED ON ALL BUT ME AND THEN I BENT OVER HER AND WHISPERED
SHALL I CREATE ANOTHER LIKE YOURSELF WHOSE JOINT WICKEDNESS MIGHT DESOLATE THE WORLD BEGONE I HAVE ANSWERED YOU YOU MAY TORTURE ME BUT I WILL NEVER CONSENT YOU ARE IN THE WRONG REPLIED THE FIEND
WHY DID I LIVE WHY IN THAT INSTANT DID I NOT EXTINGUISH THE SPARK OF EXISTENCE WHICH YOU HAD SO WANTONLY BESTOWED I KNOW NOT
WHEN NIGHT CAME I QUITTED MY RETREAT AND WANDERED IN THE WOOD AND NOW NO LONGER RESTRAINED BY THE FEAR OF DISCOVERY I GAVE VENT TO MY ANGUISH IN FEARFUL HOWLINGS
AND HER LOVELY LIPS BUT PRESENTLY MY RAGE RETURNED I REMEMBERED THAT I WAS FOREVER DEPRIVED OF THE DELIGHTS THAT SUCH BEAUTIFUL CREATURES COULD BESTOW AND THAT SHE WHOSE RESEMBLANCE I CONTEMPLATED WOULD IN REGARDING ME
INFLAMED BY PAIN I VOWED ETERNAL HATRED AND VENGEANCE TO ALL MANKIND BUT THE AGONY OF MY WOUND OVERCAME ME MY PULSES PAUSED AND I FAINTED
INFORMATION FROM A SINGLE HUMAN BEING BUT I DID NOT DESPAIR FROM YOU ONLY COULD I HOPE FOR SUCCOUR ALTHOUGH TOWARDS YOU I FELT NO SENTIMENT BUT THAT OF HATRED
I HAD NO RIGHT TO WITHHOLD FROM HIM THE SMALL PORTION OF HAPPINESS WHICH WAS YET IN MY POWER TO BESTOW YOU SWEAR I SAID TO BE HARMLESS BUT HAVE YOU NOT
TO MEDITATE IN WHAT MANNER I SHOULD APPLY TO YOU I WAS OPPRESSED BY FATIGUE AND HUNGER AND FAR TOO UNHAPPY TO ENJOY THE GENTLE BREEZES OF EVENING OR THE PROSPECT OF THE SUN SETTING BEHIND THE STUPENDOUS MOUNTAINS OF JURA
AND STIRRED STRANGE THOUGHTS WITHIN ME I WEPT BITTERLY AND CLASPING MY HANDS IN AGONY I EXCLAIMED OH STARS AND CLOUDS AND WINDS YE ARE ALL ABOUT TO MOCK ME
I WAS LIKE A WILD BEAST THAT HAD BROKEN THE TOILS DESTROYING THE OBJECTS THAT OBSTRUCTED ME AND RANGING THROUGH THE WOOD WITH A STAG LIKE SWIFTNESS OH WHAT A MISERABLE NIGHT I PASSED
THESE THOUGHTS CALMED ME AND IN THE AFTERNOON I SANK INTO A PROFOUND SLEEP BUT THE FEVER OF MY BLOOD DID NOT ALLOW ME TO BE VISITED BY PEACEFUL DREAMS THE HORRIBLE SCENE OF THE PRECEDING DAY WAS
AND DID I NOT AS HIS MAKER OWE HIM ALL THE PORTION OF HAPPINESS THAT IT WAS IN MY POWER TO BESTOW
REVIVE WITHIN ME HALF SURPRISED BY THE NOVELTY OF THESE SENSATIONS I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THEM AND FORGETTING MY SOLITUDE AND DEFORMITY DARED TO BE HAPPY
WHICH YOU MUST NOT REFUSE TO CONCEDE THE LATTER PART OF HIS TALE HAD KINDLED ANEW IN ME THE ANGER THAT HAD DIED AWAY WHILE HE NARRATED HIS PEACEFUL LIFE AMONG THE COTTAGERS AND AS HE SAID THIS
NATURE DECAYED AROUND ME AND THE SUN BECAME HEATLESS RAIN AND SNOW POURED AROUND ME MIGHTY RIVERS WERE FROZEN THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WAS HARD AND CHILL AND BARE
SUCH AS WOULD ALONE COMPENSATE FOR THE OUTRAGES AND ANGUISH I HAD ENDURED AFTER SOME WEEKS MY WOUND HEALED AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY
PRESENTLY TWO COUNTRYMEN PASSED BY BUT PAUSING NEAR THE COTTAGE THEY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION USING VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS BUT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY SAID AS THEY SPOKE THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY
UNFEELING HEARTLESS CREATOR YOU HAD ENDOWED ME WITH PERCEPTIONS AND PASSIONS AND THEN CAST ME ABROAD AN OBJECT FOR THE SCORN AND HORROR OF MANKIND BUT ON YOU ONLY
WAS QUICKLY ENVELOPED BY THE FLAMES WHICH CLUNG TO IT AND LICKED IT WITH THEIR FORKED AND DESTROYING TONGUES AS SOON AS I WAS CONVINCED THAT NO ASSISTANCE COULD SAVE ANY PART OF THE HABITATION I QUITTED THE SCENE
WOULD SHE ASSUREDLY ACT IF HER DARKENED EYES OPENED AND SHE BEHELD ME THE THOUGHT WAS MADNESS
I TREMBLED VIOLENTLY APPREHENDING SOME DREADFUL MISFORTUNE THE INSIDE OF THE COTTAGE WAS DARK AND I HEARD NO MOTION I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE AGONY OF THIS SUSPENSE
I GENERALLY RESTED DURING THE DAY AND TRAVELLED ONLY WHEN I WAS SECURED BY NIGHT FROM THE VIEW OF MAN ONE MORNING HOWEVER FINDING THAT MY PATH LAY THROUGH A DEEP WOOD I VENTURED TO CONTINUE MY JOURNEY AFTER THE SUN HAD RISEN
TO ONE EXPRESSIVE OF DISGUST AND AFFRIGHT CAN YOU WONDER THAT SUCH THOUGHTS TRANSPORTED ME WITH RAGE I ONLY WONDER THAT AT THAT MOMENT
I CONTINUED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY IN MY HOVEL IN A STATE OF UTTER AND STUPID DESPAIR MY PROTECTORS HAD DEPARTED AND HAD BROKEN THE ONLY LINK THAT HELD ME TO THE WORLD
BUT THAT CANNOT BE THE HUMAN SENSES ARE INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIERS TO OUR UNION YET MINE SHALL NOT BE THE SUBMISSION OF ABJECT SLAVERY I WILL REVENGE MY INJURIES
SPREAD HAVOC AND DESTRUCTION AROUND ME AND THEN TO HAVE SAT DOWN AND ENJOYED THE RUIN BUT THIS WAS A LUXURY OF SENSATION THAT COULD NOT ENDURE
I ENTERED A BARN WHICH HAD APPEARED TO ME TO BE EMPTY A WOMAN WAS SLEEPING ON SOME STRAW SHE WAS YOUNG NOT INDEED SO BEAUTIFUL AS HER WHOSE PORTRAIT I HELD
AND PLACED THE PORTRAIT SECURELY IN ONE OF THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS SHE MOVED AGAIN AND I FLED FOR SOME DAYS I HAUNTED THE SPOT WHERE THESE SCENES HAD TAKEN PLACE
I SANK TO THE GROUND AND MY INJURER WITH INCREASED SWIFTNESS ESCAPED INTO THE WOOD THIS
AND ALL WITHIN ME WAS TURNED TO GALL AND BITTERNESS
I SHUDDERED WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF MY CONSENT BUT I FELT THAT THERE WAS SOME JUSTICE IN HIS ARGUMENT HIS TALE AND THE FEELINGS HE NOW EXPRESSED PROVED HIM TO BE A CREATURE OF FINE SENSATIONS
REMEMBER THAT AND TELL ME WHY I SHOULD PITY MAN MORE THAN HE PITIES ME YOU WOULD NOT CALL IT MURDER IF YOU COULD PRECIPITATE ME INTO ONE OF THOSE ICE RIFTS AND DESTROY MY FRAME THE WORK OF YOUR OWN HANDS
AND WHEN I CONSIDERED WHAT HAD PASSED AT THE COTTAGE I COULD NOT HELP BELIEVING THAT I HAD BEEN TOO HASTY IN MY CONCLUSIONS I HAD CERTAINLY ACTED IMPRUDENTLY
SOFT TEARS AGAIN BEDEWED MY CHEEKS AND I EVEN RAISED MY HUMID EYES WITH THANKFULNESS TOWARDS THE BLESSED SUN WHICH BESTOWED SUCH JOY UPON ME
AND SENT ME FORTH TO THIS INSUPPORTABLE MISERY THE SUN ROSE I HEARD THE VOICES OF MEN AND KNEW THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RETURN TO MY RETREAT DURING THAT DAY
THE COLD STARS SHONE IN MOCKERY AND THE BARE TREES WAVED THEIR BRANCHES ABOVE ME NOW AND THEN THE SWEET VOICE OF A BIRD BURST FORTH AMIDST THE UNIVERSAL STILLNESS ALL
LET ME FEEL GRATITUDE TOWARDS YOU FOR ONE BENEFIT LET ME SEE THAT I EXCITE THE SYMPATHY OF SOME EXISTING THING DO NOT DENY ME MY REQUEST I WAS MOVED
IT WAS APPARENT THAT MY CONVERSATION HAD INTERESTED THE FATHER IN MY BEHALF AND I WAS A FOOL IN HAVING EXPOSED MY PERSON TO THE HORROR OF HIS CHILDREN I OUGHT TO HAVE FAMILIARIZED THE OLD DE LACEY TO ME AND BY DEGREES
SUDDENLY AS I GAZED ON HIM AN IDEA SEIZED ME THAT THIS LITTLE CREATURE WAS UNPREJUDICED AND HAD LIVED TOO SHORT A TIME TO HAVE IMBIBED A HORROR OF DEFORMITY
NECESSARILY ARISE WHEN I LIVE IN COMMUNION WITH AN EQUAL I SHALL FEEL THE AFFECTIONS OF A SENSITIVE BEING AND BECOME LINKED TO THE CHAIN OF EXISTENCE AND EVENTS FROM WHICH I AM NOW EXCLUDED
SOMETIMES WISHING TO SEE YOU SOMETIMES RESOLVED TO QUIT THE WORLD AND ITS MISERIES FOREVER AT LENGTH I WANDERED TOWARDS THESE MOUNTAINS AND HAVE RANGED THROUGH THEIR
MY BELOVED AWAKE THE SLEEPER STIRRED A THRILL OF TERROR RAN THROUGH ME SHOULD SHE INDEED AWAKE AND SEE ME AND CURSE ME AND DENOUNCE THE MURDERER THUS
HE CONTINUED YOU MUST CREATE A FEMALE FOR ME WITH WHOM I CAN LIVE IN THE INTERCHANGE OF THOSE SYMPATHIES NECESSARY FOR MY BEING THIS YOU ALONE CAN DO AND I DEMAND IT OF YOU AS A RIGHT
ACCORDINGLY I HID MYSELF IN SOME THICK UNDERWOOD DETERMINING TO DEVOTE THE ENSUING HOURS TO REFLECTION ON MY SITUATION THE PLEASANT SUNSHINE AND THE PURE AIR OF DAY RESTORED ME TO SOME DEGREE OF TRANQUILLITY
I WILL WORK AT YOUR DESTRUCTION NOR FINISH UNTIL I DESOLATE YOUR HEART SO THAT YOU SHALL CURSE THE HOUR OF YOUR BIRTH A FIENDISH RAGE ANIMATED HIM AS HE SAID THIS
HATED AND DESPISED EVERY COUNTRY MUST BE EQUALLY HORRIBLE AT LENGTH THE THOUGHT OF YOU CROSSED MY MIND I LEARNED FROM YOUR PAPERS
THE DAY WHICH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OF SPRING CHEERED EVEN ME BY THE LOVELINESS OF ITS SUNSHINE AND THE BALMINESS OF THE AIR I FELT EMOTIONS OF GENTLENESS AND PLEASURE THAT HAD LONG APPEARED DEAD
PERSEVERE IN THIS EXILE YOU WILL RETURN AND AGAIN SEEK THEIR KINDNESS AND YOU WILL MEET WITH THEIR DETESTATION YOUR EVIL PASSIONS WILL BE RENEWED AND YOU WILL THEN HAVE A COMPANION TO AID YOU IN THE TASK OF DESTRUCTION
WHAT I ASK OF YOU IS REASONABLE AND MODERATE I DEMAND A CREATURE OF ANOTHER SEX BUT AS HIDEOUS AS MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION IS SMALL
THE STARS SHONE AT INTERVALS AS THE CLOUDS PASSED FROM OVER THEM THE DARK PINES ROSE BEFORE ME AND EVERY HERE AND THERE A BROKEN TREE LAY ON THE GROUND IT WAS A SCENE OF WONDERFUL SOLEMNITY
THE MORE DEEPLY DID I FEEL THE SPIRIT OF REVENGE ENKINDLED IN MY HEART SNOW FELL AND THE WATERS WERE HARDENED BUT I RESTED NOT
AND WAITED ANXIOUSLY TO DISCOVER FROM HIS DISCOURSE THE MEANING OF THESE UNUSUAL APPEARANCES DO YOU CONSIDER SAID HIS COMPANION TO HIM THAT YOU WILL BE OBLIGED TO PAY THREE MONTHS RENT AND TO LOSE THE PRODUCE OF YOUR GARDEN
AND QUICKLY LOST AMONG THE UNDULATIONS OF THE SEA OF ICE
REPLIED I TO FLY FROM THE HABITATIONS OF MAN TO DWELL IN THOSE WILDS WHERE THE BEASTS OF THE FIELD WILL BE YOUR ONLY COMPANIONS HOW CAN YOU WHO LONG FOR THE LOVE AND SYMPATHY OF MAN
I TOOK NO REST BUT RETURNED IMMEDIATELY TO GENEVA EVEN IN MY OWN HEART I COULD GIVE NO EXPRESSION TO MY SENSATIONS THEY WEIGHED ON ME WITH A MOUNTAIN'S WEIGHT AND THEIR EXCESS DESTROYED MY AGONY BENEATH THEM
AND THE SUFFERINGS I ENDURED INTENSE IT WAS LATE IN AUTUMN WHEN I QUITTED THE DISTRICT WHERE I HAD SO LONG RESIDED I TRAVELLED ONLY AT NIGHT FEARFUL OF ENCOUNTERING THE VISAGE OF A HUMAN BEING
FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FEELINGS OF REVENGE AND HATRED FILLED MY BOSOM AND I DID NOT STRIVE TO CONTROL THEM BUT ALLOWING MYSELF TO BE BORNE AWAY BY THE STREAM I BENT MY MIND TOWARDS INJURY AND DEATH
IF I CANNOT INSPIRE LOVE I WILL CAUSE FEAR AND CHIEFLY TOWARDS YOU MY ARCH ENEMY BECAUSE MY CREATOR DO I SWEAR INEXTINGUISHABLE HATRED HAVE A CARE
IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF PLACES MY EVIL PASSIONS WILL HAVE FLED FOR I SHALL MEET WITH SYMPATHY MY LIFE WILL FLOW QUIETLY AWAY AND IN MY DYING MOMENTS I SHALL NOT CURSE MY MAKER
WELL I COULD NOT REST I WAS HALF MAD I SAY AND WENT ABOUT STILL TRYING IF I COULD NOT DISCOVER HIS NAME AND WHO HE WAS I DID COME UPON HIM BUT HE WAS WALKING QUICKLY ARM IN ARM WITH WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN
WHO WAS IT QUIVERED RICHARD AS JOYCE WAS HEARD GOING AWAY IT WAS JOYCE WHAT IS SHE HERE STILL
IN ONE OF THE COMFORTABLE SITTING ROOMS OF EAST LYNNE SAT MISTER CARLYLE AND HIS SISTER ONE INCLEMENT JANUARY NIGHT THE CONTRAST WITHIN AND WITHOUT WAS GREAT THE WARM BLAZING FIRE THE HANDSOME CARPET ON WHICH IT FLICKERED
SHE SAT ON FIVE MINUTES LONGER AND THEN LEFT WISHING MISTER CARLYLE GOOD NIGHT HE RESUMED HIS READING BUT ANOTHER PAGE OR TWO CONCLUDED THE ARTICLE UPON WHICH MISTER CARLYLE THREW THE BOOK ON THE TABLE
I BOLTED UNDER THE HORSES OF A PASSING VEHICLE DOWN SOME TURNINGS AND PASSAGES OUT INTO ANOTHER STREET AND UP BESIDE A CABMAN WHO WAS ON HIS BOX DRIVING A FARE PAST I REACHED MY LODGINGS IN SAFETY AS I THOUGHT
ON THE VERY MORNING AFTER HIS HAVING HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HER WELL SIR AND I DARE SAY YOU ARE NOT SORRY TO BE BACK AGAIN FOR IT IS JUST THE PLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND INDEED FOR EVERYBODY ELSE TOO
HE HAD GOT INTO A PRIVATE CARRIAGE AS HE SPOKE AND IT DROVE AWAY I COULD SEE THAT IT HAD A GREAT COAT OF ARMS UPON IT WHEN DO YOU SAY THIS WAS A WEEK AGO
THIS INAPPLICABLE ANSWER MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH FOR THE COMPREHENSION OF MANY BUT IT DID NOT PUZZLE MISSUS ALLEN FOR AFTER ONLY A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION SHE SAID IN A WHISPER TO CATHERINE
CATHERINE HAD FORTITUDE TOO SHE SUFFERED BUT NO MURMUR PASSED HER LIPS FROM THIS STATE OF HUMILIATION SHE WAS ROUSED AT THE END OF TEN MINUTES
I KNOW YOU WILL NOT MIND MY GOING AWAY AND I DARE SAY JOHN WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT AND THEN YOU MAY EASILY FIND ME OUT CATHERINE THOUGH A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
BUT ALL IN VAIN HE WOULD NOT STIR AN INCH WAS NOT IT SO MISTER MORLAND BUT YOU MEN ARE ALL SO IMMODERATELY LAZY
BUT SHE RESISTED I TELL YOU MISTER MORLAND SHE CRIED I WOULD NOT DO SUCH A THING FOR ALL THE WORLD
AND THEY CONTINUED AS THEY WERE FOR THREE MINUTES LONGER WHEN ISABELLA WHO HAD BEEN TALKING TO JAMES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER TURNED AGAIN TO HIS SISTER AND WHISPERED MY DEAR CREATURE I AM AFRAID I MUST LEAVE YOU YOUR BROTHER IS SO AMAZINGLY IMPATIENT TO BEGIN
I DON'T POSSESS A PENNY PIECE HE ADDED DRAWING OUT HIS TROUSERS POCKETS FOR THE INSPECTION OF MISTER CARLYLE THE LAST COPPERS I HAD THREE PENCE I SPENT IN BREAD AND CHEESE AND HALF A PINT OF BEER AT MIDDAY
I TELL MISTER ALLEN WHEN HE TALKS OF BEING SICK OF IT THAT I AM SURE HE SHOULD NOT COMPLAIN FOR IT IS SO VERY AGREEABLE A PLACE THAT IT IS MUCH BETTER TO BE HERE THAN AT HOME AT THIS DULL TIME OF YEAR
PREVENTED THEIR DOING MORE THAN GOING THROUGH THE FIRST RUDIMENTS OF AN ACQUAINTANCE BY INFORMING THEMSELVES HOW WELL THE OTHER LIKED BATH HOW MUCH SHE ADMIRED ITS BUILDINGS AND SURROUNDING COUNTRY WHETHER SHE DREW OR PLAYED OR SANG
IF THORN WERE NOT HALLIJOHN'S MURDERER WHY SHOULD HE BE PERSECUTING ME WHAT WOULD HE CARE ABOUT ME AND WHY SHOULD HIS FACE TURN LIVID AS IT HAS DONE EACH TIME HE HAS SEEN MY EYES UPON HIM
I HAVE BEEN PRETTY NEARLY EVER SINCE ON MY FEET REACHING HERE I ONLY GOT A LIFT NOW AND THEN BUT RICHARD DO YOU KNOW THAT WEST LYNNE IS THE VERY WORST PLACE YOU COULD HAVE FLOWN TO
FIRED RICHARD IT WAS THORN RICHARD YOU CANNOT TELL
AND FROM THE WHOLE SHE DEDUCED THIS USEFUL LESSON THAT TO GO PREVIOUSLY ENGAGED TO A BALL DOES NOT NECESSARILY INCREASE EITHER THE DIGNITY OR ENJOYMENT OF A YOUNG LADY
THAT SHE WAS ALONE AT THE BACK OF THE COTTAGE AND KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT TILL AFTERWARDS HOW COULD SHE HAVE SWORN SHE WAS ALONE IF THORN WAS WITH HER THE FACT HAD ENTIRELY ESCAPED MISTER CARLYLE'S MEMORY IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH AFY
SHE WAS SHARING WITH THE SCORES OF OTHER YOUNG LADIES STILL SITTING DOWN ALL THE DISCREDIT OF WANTING A PARTNER TO BE DISGRACED IN THE EYE OF THE WORLD TO WEAR THE APPEARANCE OF INFAMY WHILE HER HEART IS ALL PURITY
BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS SPOKEN THE ROOM DOOR WAS TRIED AND THEN GENTLY KNOCKED AT MISTER CARLYLE PLACED HIS HAND ON RICHARD WHO WAS LOOKING SCARED OUT OF HIS WITS
AND WHOM CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY GUESSED TO BE HIS SISTER THUS UNTHINKINGLY THROWING AWAY A FAIR OPPORTUNITY OF CONSIDERING HIM LOST TO HER FOREVER BY BEING MARRIED ALREADY BUT GUIDED ONLY BY WHAT WAS SIMPLE AND PROBABLE
SHE MUST HAVE GIVEN IN TO THE ENEMY BUT TRIFLING AILMENTS SUCH AS HEADACHE INFLUENZA SORE THROAT WHICH OTHER PEOPLE GET PASSED HER BY IMAGINE THEREFORE HER EXASPERATION AT FINDING HER HEAD STUFFED UP
A YOUNGISH MAN ISN'T HE SAID I VERY SMART WITH A PRETTY WIFE I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CALL YOUNGISH HE LAUGHED MY MASTER'S TURNED SIXTY AND HIS WIFE'S AS OLD THAT CHECKED ME
AND I WISHED TO KNOW HIS NAME WELL MISTER CARLYLE I COULD GET AT NOTHING SATISFACTORY THE FELLOW SAID THAT A GREAT MANY HAD CALLED THERE THAT DAY FOR HIS MASTER WAS JUST UP FROM A LONG ILLNESS AND PEOPLE CAME TO SEE HIM IS THAT ALL RICHARD
SUDDENLY BECKONED TO A POLICEMAN POINTED ME OUT AND SAID SOMETHING TO HIM IN A FAST TONE THAT FRIGHTENED ME AND I SLIPPED AWAY TWO HOURS AFTER WHEN I WAS IN QUITE A DIFFERENT PART OF THE TOWN IN TURNING MY HEAD I SAW THE SAME POLICEMAN FOLLOWING ME
THE EXCEEDINGLY COMFORTABLE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER AND THE LIGHT OF THE CHANDELIER WHICH FELL ON ALL PRESENTED A PICTURE OF HOME PEACE THOUGH IT MAY NOT HAVE DESERVED THE NAME OF LUXURY WITHOUT
HE WOULD TURN ROUND UPON ME NOW AND SWEAR MY LIFE AWAY TO MURDER WELL I THOUGHT I'D ASCERTAIN FOR CERTAIN WHAT HIS NAME WAS AND THAT NIGHT I WENT TO THE HOUSE AND GOT INTO CONVERSATION WITH ONE OF THE SERVANTS WHO WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR
PRODUCED SEVERE MORTIFICATION TO THE LADY AND IN GIVING HER DENIAL SHE EXPRESSED HER SORROW ON THE OCCASION SO VERY MUCH AS IF SHE REALLY FELT IT THAT HAD THORPE WHO JOINED HER JUST AFTERWARDS BEEN HALF A MINUTE EARLIER
ROSE AND STRETCHED HIMSELF AS IF TIRED OF SITTING HE STIRRED THE FIRE INTO A BRIGHTER BLAZE AND STOOD ON THE HEARTHRUG I WONDER IF IT SNOWS STILL HE EXCLAIMED TO HIMSELF
AND HE OPENED THE WINDOW AND STEPPED HALF OUT THE SNOW WAS FALLING FASTER AND THICKER THAN EVER NOT AT THAT DID MISTER CARLYLE START WITH SURPRISE IF NOT WITH A MORE UNPLEASANT SENSATION
YES SIR AND DOCTOR SKINNER AND HIS FAMILY WERE HERE THREE MONTHS SO I TELL MISTER ALLEN HE MUST NOT BE IN A HURRY TO GET AWAY
I'M SURE I HAVE BEEN FREE ENOUGH ALL MY LIFE FROM REQUIRING SUCH SICK DISHES DO SO SAID MISTER CARLYLE IT MAY DO YOU GOOD
AND ISABELLA HAVING GONE THROUGH THE USUAL CEREMONIAL OF MEETING HER FRIEND WITH THE MOST SMILING AND AFFECTIONATE HASTE OF ADMIRING THE SET OF HER GOWN AND ENVYING THE CURL OF HER HAIR THEY FOLLOWED THEIR CHAPERONES ARM IN ARM INTO THE BALLROOM
HE MAY HAVE BROUGHT HALF A DOZEN MORE WITH HIM GASPED THE UNHAPPY RICHARD I SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE DODGED ME ALL THE WAY HERE NONSENSE SIT YOU DOWN AND BE AT REST IT IS ONLY CORNELIA
A NEIGHBOUR OF OURS DOCTOR SKINNER WAS HERE FOR HIS HEALTH LAST WINTER AND CAME AWAY QUITE STOUT
I SHALL FIX MYSELF IN SOME OTHER BIG TOWN FAR AWAY FROM LONDON LIVERPOOL OR MANCHESTER PERHAPS AND SEE WHAT EMPLOYMENT I CAN GET INTO
BUT SHE HAD NOT LOOKED ROUND LONG BEFORE SHE SAW HIM LEADING A YOUNG LADY TO THE DANCE AH HE HAS GOT A PARTNER I WISH HE HAD ASKED YOU SAID MISSUS ALLEN AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE SHE ADDED
WHETHER HE DID COMMIT THE MURDER OR WHETHER HE DIDN'T HE MUST KNOW THAT I DID NOT BECAUSE HE CAME UPON ME WAITING AS HE WAS TEARING FROM THE COTTAGE DICK'S REASONING WAS NOT BAD ANOTHER THING HE RESUMED
AYE FOR HE HAD BEEN HOURS AND HOURS ON FOOT IN THE SNOW HIS HAT HIS CLOTHES HIS EYEBROWS
VERY AGREEABLE MADAM I AM GLAD OF IT JOHN HAS CHARMING SPIRITS HAS NOT HE DID YOU MEET MISTER TILNEY MY DEAR SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WHERE IS HE
MISS CARLYLE HAS LEFT HER HANDKERCHIEF DOWNSTAIRS SIR AND HAS SENT ME FOR IT YOU CANNOT COME IN I AM BUSY WAS THE ANSWER DELIVERED IN A CLEAR AND MOST DECISIVE TONE
WERE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED BY A LADY AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS THORPE
SET ON BY THAT WRETCH THORN MISTER CARLYLE TURNED TO THE SIDEBOARD AND POURED OUT A WINEGLASS OF BRANDY DRINK IT RICHARD IT WILL WARM YOU I'D RATHER HAVE IT IN SOME HOT WATER SIR
I HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE THAT WINDOW FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR SIR INDEED AND AS I NEARED WEST LYNNE I BEGAN TO THINK WHAT I SHOULD DO IT WAS NO USE IN ME TRYING TO CATCH BARBARA'S ATTENTION
MY DEAREST CREATURE I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU THIS HOUR WHAT COULD INDUCE YOU TO COME INTO THIS SET
IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT MISS CARLYLE INVITED HER TO THEIRS OF AN EVENING AND THE HOUSE WAS QUITE MISTER CARLYLE WAS DEEP IN THE PAGES OF ONE OF THE MONTHLY PERIODICALS AND MISS CARLYLE SAT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FIRE GRUMBLING
HE IS A VERY AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN INDEED HE IS MISSUS ALLEN SAID MISSUS THORPE SMILING COMPLACENTLY I MUST SAY IT THOUGH I AM HIS MOTHER THAT THERE IS NOT A MORE AGREEABLE YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD
IT HAS COME TO LIGHT THAT YOU WERE HERE BEFORE DISGUISED AS A FARM LABORER
MISS TILNEY EXPRESSING A PROPER SENSE OF SUCH GOODNESS MISS MORLAND WITH THE REAL DELICACY OF A GENEROUS MIND MAKING LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION
WAS VERY IMPORTUNATE WITH ISABELLA TO STAND UP BUT JOHN WAS GONE INTO THE CARD ROOM TO SPEAK TO A FRIEND AND NOTHING SHE DECLARED
WE DIDN'T GO MUCH MORE THAN THE LENGTH OF A STREET I WAS ON THE PAVEMENT BEFORE THORN WAS AND LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN HE WENT WHITE I MARKED THE HOUSE THINKING IT WAS WHERE HE LIVED AND
AND THIS PERSUASION DID NOT INCLINE HER TO A VERY GRACIOUS REPLY WHEN JOHN THORPE CAME UP TO HER SOON AFTERWARDS AND SAID WELL MISS MORLAND I SUPPOSE YOU AND I ARE TO STAND UP AND JIG IT TOGETHER AGAIN OH NO I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU
OR HE WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO POINT OUT THE DISCREPANCY AND TO INQUIRE HOW SHE COULD RECONCILE IT YET HER ASSERTION TO HIM HAD BEEN MOST POSITIVE AND SOLEMN THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN THE MATTER WHICH HE COULD NOT RECONCILE
THAT YOU HAVE NEVER DROPPED UPON HIM PREVIOUSLY INTERRUPTED MISTER CARLYLE NO SIR AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO SHOW MYSELF IN THOSE LATTER PARTS OF THE TOWN FEARING I MIGHT MEET WITH SOME ONE I USED TO KNOW AT HOME
AS THEY HAD AGREED TO JOIN THEIR PARTY THIS WAS ACCORDINGLY DONE MISTER TILNEY STILL CONTINUING STANDING BEFORE THEM AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES CONSIDERATION HE ASKED CATHERINE TO DANCE WITH HIM THIS COMPLIMENT DELIGHTFUL AS IT WAS
WE HAD BETTER TAKE A CAB MY DEAR WITH THAT THE MAN I WAS TALKING TO SWUNG OPEN THE DOOR OF HIS CAB AND SHE GOT IN SUCH A FAIR YOUNG LADY SHE WAS I TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM
I WANT TO KNOW YOUR NAME I SAID THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME AT PRESENT HE FLEW INTO A PASSION AND SWORE THAT IF EVER HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF ME NEAR HIM AGAIN HE WOULD HAND ME OVER INTO CUSTODY
FOR SOME CUPBOARD OR MOUSE HOLE INTO WHICH HE MIGHT CREEP AND SEEING NONE RUSHED TO THE FIREPLACE AND PLACED HIS FOOT ON THE FENDER THAT HE PURPOSED AN ATTEMPT AT CHIMNEY CLIMBING WAS EVIDENT THOUGH HOW THE FIRE WOULD HAVE AGREED WITH HIS PANTALOONS
BUT A FEELING A MAN'S HAND TOUCH HIS AND AT FINDING A MAN'S FACE NEARLY IN CONTACT WITH HIS OWN LET ME COME IN MISTER CARLYLE FOR THE LOVE OF LIFE I SEE YOU ARE ALONE
THE TONES STRUCK FAMILIARLY ON MISTER CARLYLE'S EAR HE DREW BACK MECHANICALLY A THOUSAND PERPLEXING SENSATIONS OVERWHELMING HIM AND THE MAN FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE ROOM A WHITE MAN AS LUCY CALLED HER FATHER
RICHARD HARE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND MY PROOFS OF HIS GUILT MISTER CARLYLE I COULD BRING NONE AGAINST HIM NO POSITIVE ONES
LET ME LOOK AT HER THIS MOMENT WHAT A DELIGHTFUL GIRL I NEVER SAW ANYTHING HALF SO BEAUTIFUL BUT WHERE IS HER ALL CONQUERING BROTHER IS HE IN THE ROOM
NOT TO SPEAK OF WHAT THEY CONTAINED POOR DICK APPEARED COMPLETELY TO IGNORE MISTER CARLYLE DREW HIM BACK KEEPING HIS CALM POWERFUL HAND UPON HIS SHOULDER WHILE CERTAIN SOUNDS IN AN ANGRY VOICE WERE JERKED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE
IN A WEEK'S TIME I CAME UPON HIM AGAIN IT WAS AT NIGHT HE WAS COMING OUT OF ONE OF THE THEATRES AND I WENT UP AND STOOD BEFORE HIM WHAT DO YOU WANT FELLOW HE ASKED I HAVE SEEN YOU WATCHING ME BEFORE THIS
MY SWEET CATHERINE DO SUPPORT ME PERSUADE YOUR BROTHER HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS TELL HIM THAT IT WOULD QUITE SHOCK YOU TO SEE ME DO SUCH A THING NOW WOULD NOT IT NO NOT AT ALL
MISTER CARLYLE HE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE IS THIS LIFE TO GO ON WITH ME FOREVER I AM DEEPLY SORRY FOR YOU RICHARD WAS THE SYMPATHIZING ANSWER I WISH I COULD REMEDY IT
COME ALONG MY DEAREST CATHERINE FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE AND STAND BY ME AND OFF THEY WENT TO REGAIN THEIR FORMER PLACE JOHN THORPE IN THE MEANWHILE HAD WALKED AWAY AND CATHERINE EVER WILLING TO GIVE MISTER TILNEY AN OPPORTUNITY
WHO WOULD RECOGNIZE ME SO I HAVE KEPT MOSTLY IN OBSCURE PLACES STABLES AND SUCH LIKE I HAD GONE UP TO THE WEST END THIS DAY ON A MATTER OF BUSINESS WELL GO ON WITH YOUR STORY
AND YOU MIGHT JUST HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH ASTONISHMENT MISTER CARLYLE IT WAS THE MAN THORN INDEED YOU THOUGHT I MIGHT BE MISTAKEN IN HIM THAT MOONLIGHT NIGHT
NOW THAT I HAVE GOT OVER MY PASSION FOR AFY I CAN SEE HER FAULTS MISTER CARLYLE SHE'D NO MORE TELL AN UNTRUTH THAN I SHOULD STICK A MOST AWFUL THUNDERING AT THE ROOM DOOR
AND SUPPLYING THE PLACE OF MANY IDEAS BY A SQUEEZE OF THE HAND OR A SMILE OF AFFECTION THE DANCING BEGAN WITHIN A FEW MINUTES AFTER THEY WERE SEATED AND JAMES WHO HAD BEEN ENGAGED QUITE AS LONG AS HIS SISTER
AND WITHOUT EXAGGERATED FEELINGS OF ECSTATIC DELIGHT OR INCONCEIVABLE VEXATION ON EVERY LITTLE TRIFLING OCCURRENCE CATHERINE INTERESTED AT ONCE BY HER APPEARANCE AND HER RELATIONSHIP TO MISTER TILNEY
AND THE SNOW HAD SO SETTLED UPON HIM THAT LUCY WHO HAPPENED TO SEE HIM AS HE ENTERED THE HALL SCREAMED OUT LAUGHINGLY
IN THIS COMMONPLACE CHATTER WHICH LASTED SOME TIME THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT SEEMED ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN
MISTER TILNEY WAS DRAWN AWAY FROM THEIR PARTY AT TEA TO ATTEND THAT OF HIS PARTNER MISS TILNEY THOUGH BELONGING TO IT DID NOT SIT NEAR HER AND JAMES AND ISABELLA WERE SO MUCH ENGAGED IN CONVERSING TOGETHER
NO THAT I CAN'T IF SHE HAS A MIND TO COME IN WAS THE CANDID ANSWER YOU REMEMBER WHAT SHE WAS RICHARD SHE IS NOT ALTERED KNOWING THAT TO SPEAK ON THIS SIDE THE DOOR TO HIS SISTER
PROCEEDING TO THE WINDOW ONE OF THOSE OPENING TO THE GROUND HE THREW ASIDE THE HALF OF THE WARM CRIMSON CURTAIN IT ALL LOOKED DULL AND DARK OUTSIDE MISTER CARLYLE COULD SEE LITTLE WHAT THE WEATHER WAS
SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING VEXED AT THE NON APPEARANCE OF MISTER THORPE FOR SHE NOT ONLY LONGED TO BE DANCING BUT WAS LIKEWISE AWARE THAT AS THE REAL DIGNITY OF HER SITUATION COULD NOT BE KNOWN
HE WAS WITH US JUST NOW AND SAID HE WAS SO TIRED OF LOUNGING ABOUT THAT HE WAS RESOLVED TO GO AND DANCE SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS HE WOULD ASK YOU IF HE MET WITH YOU
AND CATHERINE CATCHING MISTER TILNEY'S EYE INSTANTLY RECEIVED FROM HIM THE SMILING TRIBUTE OF RECOGNITION SHE RETURNED IT WITH PLEASURE AND THEN ADVANCING STILL NEARER HE SPOKE BOTH TO HER AND MISSUS ALLEN
DOES CAPTAIN THORN LIVE HERE I ASKED HIM MISTER WESTLEBY LIVES HERE SAID HE I DON'T KNOW ANY CAPTAIN THORN
LOUD ENOUGH TO BRING THE VERY HOUSE DOWN NO OFFICERS OF JUSTICE SEARCHING FOR A FUGITIVE EVER MADE A LOUDER RICHARD HARE HIS FACE TURNED TO CHALK HIS EYES STARTING
YOU MEN HAVE SUCH RESTLESS CURIOSITY TALK OF THE CURIOSITY OF WOMEN INDEED TIS NOTHING BUT BE SATISFIED FOR YOU ARE NOT TO KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL OF THE MATTER AND IS THAT LIKELY TO SATISFY ME DO YOU THINK
OUR TWO DANCES ARE OVER AND BESIDES I AM TIRED AND DO NOT MEAN TO DANCE ANY MORE DO NOT YOU THEN LET US WALK ABOUT AND QUIZ PEOPLE COME ALONG WITH ME AND I WILL SHOW YOU THE FOUR GREATEST QUIZZERS IN THE ROOM
WHEN SHE WAS IN ONE OF HER RESOLUTE MOODS WOULD BE OF NO USE MISTER CARLYLE OPENED THE DOOR DEXTEROUSLY SWUNG HIMSELF THROUGH IT AND SHUT IT AFTER HIM
I DIE TO SEE HIM MISTER MORLAND YOU ARE NOT TO LISTEN WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU BUT WHAT IS ALL THIS WHISPERING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE NOW I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE
AFY DECLARED HE WAS WITH HER REPEATED MISTER CARLYLE LOOK HERE SIR YOU ARE A SHARP MAN AND FOLKS SAY I AM NOT BUT I CAN SEE THINGS AND DRAW MY REASONING AS WELL AS THEY CAN PERHAPS
DROP UPON YOU THERE WAS A LITTLE PARTITION IN THE WINDOW CURTAIN IT HAD NOT BEEN DRAWN CLOSE AND THROUGH IT I COULD SEE YOU AND MISS CARLYLE I SAW HER LEAVE THE ROOM I SAW YOU COME TO THE WINDOW AND OPEN IT AND THEN I SPOKE
OR ANY OTHER LARGE PIECE OF FLANNEL YOU MAY CONVENIENTLY HAVE AT HAND AND PUT IT ON OVER YOUR NIGHT CAP I'LL TRY IT I WOULD SAID MISTER CARLYLE SMOTHERING AN IRREVERENT LAUGH
AND REMEMBER MEN ARE NOT GIVEN INTO CUSTODY FOR WATCHING OTHERS HE SIGNIFICANTLY ADDED I KNOW YOU AND IF YOU HAVE ANY REGARD FOR YOURSELF YOU'LL KEEP OUT OF MY WAY
HER CHEST SORE AND HER VOICE GOING IN SHORT AT HAVING FOR ONCE IN HER LIFE CAUGHT A COLD LIKE ORDINARY MORTALS WHAT'S THE TIME I WONDER SHE EXCLAIMED
I CUT OFF FROM LONDON AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE REPLIED RICHARD WHO WAS LITERALLY SHIVERING WITH THE COLD I'M DODGED MISTER CARLYLE I AM INDEED
THE YOUNGER MISS THORPES BEING ALSO DANCING CATHERINE WAS LEFT TO THE MERCY OF MISSUS THORPE AND MISSUS ALLEN BETWEEN WHOM SHE NOW REMAINED
IT WAS NOW LATER IN THE EVENING THE CHILDREN WERE IN BED
WHISPERED CATHERINE DETACHING HER FRIEND FROM JAMES IT IS MISTER TILNEY'S SISTER
HEAVY FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FALLING THICKLY FLAKES AS LARGE AND NEARLY AS HEAVY AS A CROWN PIECE RENDERING THE ATMOSPHERE SO DENSE AND OBSCURE THAT A MAN COULD NOT SEE A YARD BEFORE HIM MISTER CARLYLE HAD DRIVEN HOME IN THE PONY CARRIAGE
I TELL HIM HE IS QUITE IN LUCK TO BE SENT HERE FOR HIS HEALTH AND I HOPE MADAM THAT MISTER ALLEN WILL BE OBLIGED TO LIKE THE PLACE FROM FINDING IT OF SERVICE TO HIM THANK YOU SIR I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE WILL
NO ONE SHALL COME IN IT IS ONLY PETER NOT PETER'S VOICE HOWEVER BUT JOYCE'S WAS HEARD IN RESPONSE TO MISTER CARLYLE'S DEMAND OF WHO WAS THERE
TO A PLEASANTER FEELING BY SEEING NOT MISTER THORPE BUT MISTER TILNEY WITHIN THREE YARDS OF THE PLACE WHERE THEY SAT HE SEEMED TO BE MOVING THAT WAY BUT HE DID NOT SEE HER AND THEREFORE THE SMILE AND THE BLUSH
AND GRUNTING AND SNIFFLING AND CHOKING MISS CARLYLE WAS ONE OF YOUR STRONG MINDED LADIES WHO NEVER CONDESCENDED TO BE ILL OF COURSE HAD SHE BEEN ATTACKED WITH SCARLET FEVER OR PARALYSIS OR SAINT VITUS DANCE
ALL I WISH IT HAD BEEN ALL I KEPT LOOKING ABOUT FOR HIM IN ALL THE BEST STREETS I WAS HALF MAD DO YOU NOT WONDER IF HE IS IN THIS POSITION OF LIFE AND RESIDES IN LONDON
I ASSURE YOU SAID SHE I WOULD NOT STAND UP WITHOUT YOUR DEAR SISTER FOR ALL THE WORLD FOR IF I DID WE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE SEPARATED THE WHOLE EVENING CATHERINE ACCEPTED THIS KINDNESS WITH GRATITUDE
BUT HAPPENING TO GLANCE INTO THE STREET THERE I SAW THE MAN AGAIN STANDING OPPOSITE AND RECONNOITERING THE HOUSE I HAD GONE HOME HUNGRY BUT THIS TOOK ALL MY HUNGER AWAY FROM ME I OPENED THE BOX WHERE I KEPT MY DISGUISE
MADE HER WAY TO MISSUS ALLEN AND MISSUS THORPE AS FAST AS SHE COULD
BUT HOW AM I TO GET THE HOT WATER BROUGHT IN DRINK THIS FOR NOW WHY HOW YOU TREMBLE
RICHARD I QUESTIONED AFY ABOUT THORN SHE PROTESTED SOLEMNLY TO ME THAT IT WAS NOT THORN WHO COMMITTED THE DEED THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HE FOR THORN WAS WITH HER AT THE MOMENT OF ITS BEING DONE IT'S NOT TRUE
HAD TOO MUCH GOOD NATURE TO MAKE ANY OPPOSITION AND THE OTHERS RISING UP ISABELLA HAD ONLY TIME TO PRESS HER FRIEND'S HAND AND SAY GOOD BYE MY DEAR LOVE BEFORE THEY HURRIED OFF
OF THE HORSES AND DOGS OF THE FRIEND WHOM HE HAD JUST LEFT AND OF A PROPOSED EXCHANGE OF TERRIERS BETWEEN THEM INTEREST HER SO MUCH AS TO PREVENT HER LOOKING VERY OFTEN TOWARDS THAT PART OF THE ROOM WHERE SHE HAD LEFT MISTER TILNEY
I HAVE BEEN QUITE WRETCHED WITHOUT YOU MY DEAR ISABELLA HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO GET AT YOU I COULD NOT EVEN SEE WHERE YOU WERE SO I TOLD YOUR BROTHER ALL THE TIME BUT HE WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME
AND WHETHER SHE WAS FOND OF RIDING ON HORSEBACK THE TWO DANCES WERE SCARCELY CONCLUDED BEFORE CATHERINE FOUND HER ARM GENTLY SEIZED BY HER FAITHFUL ISABELLA WHO IN GREAT SPIRITS EXCLAIMED AT LAST I HAVE GOT YOU
BY WHOM HE WAS VERY CIVILLY ACKNOWLEDGED I AM VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN SIR INDEED I WAS AFRAID YOU HAD LEFT BATH HE THANKED HER FOR HER FEARS
MISS TILNEY HAD A GOOD FIGURE A PRETTY FACE AND A VERY AGREEABLE COUNTENANCE AND HER AIR THOUGH IT HAD NOT ALL THE DECIDED PRETENSION THE RESOLUTE STYLISHNESS OF MISS THORPE'S HAD MORE REAL ELEGANCE
I DARE SAY SHE THOUGHT I WAS SPEAKING OF HER SON CATHERINE WAS DISAPPOINTED AND VEXED SHE SEEMED TO HAVE MISSED BY SO LITTLE THE VERY OBJECT SHE HAD HAD IN VIEW
OF HER DEAR ISABELLA TO WHOM SHE PARTICULARLY LONGED TO POINT OUT THAT GENTLEMAN SHE COULD SEE NOTHING THEY WERE IN DIFFERENT SETS SHE WAS SEPARATED FROM ALL HER PARTY AND AWAY FROM ALL HER ACQUAINTANCE ONE MORTIFICATION SUCCEEDED ANOTHER
MISTER CARLYLE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH IT IS JUST NINE CORNELIA THEN I THINK I SHALL GO TO BED I'LL HAVE A BASIN OF ARROWROOT OR GRUEL OR SOME SLOP OF THAT SORT AFTER I'M IN IT
HEAVILY PASSED THE NIGHT SLEEP OR REPOSE THAT DESERVED THE NAME OF SLEEP WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT ROOM IN WHICH HER DISTURBED IMAGINATION HAD TORMENTED HER ON HER FIRST ARRIVAL
AND HENRY'S GRATIFIED LOOK ON BEING TOLD THAT HER STAY WAS DETERMINED
WELL IF YOU SAY IT IT WAS SO I DARE SAY BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CANNOT RECOLLECT IT I DO REMEMBER NOW BEING WITH YOU AND SEEING HIM AS WELL AS THE REST BUT THAT WE WERE
AS TO ANY ATTENTIONS ON HIS SIDE I DO DECLARE UPON MY HONOUR I NEVER WAS SENSIBLE OF THEM FOR A MOMENT EXCEPT JUST HIS ASKING ME TO DANCE THE FIRST DAY OF HIS COMING
SHE PAUSED A MOMENT AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS JUST MADE IT INTELLIGIBLE THAT SHE LEFT HER KIND REMEMBRANCE FOR HER ABSENT FRIEND
PSHA NONSENSE WAS ISABELLA'S ANSWER IN THE SAME HALF WHISPER WHY DO YOU PUT SUCH THINGS INTO MY HEAD IF I COULD BELIEVE IT MY SPIRIT YOU KNOW IS PRETTY INDEPENDENT
AND MAMMA'S APPROBATION WAS EAGERLY GIVEN
BUT I MUST NOT TRUST MYSELF WITH WORDS MY DEAR CATHERINE WE ARE TO PART MY FATHER HAS RECOLLECTED AN ENGAGEMENT THAT TAKES OUR WHOLE FAMILY AWAY ON MONDAY WE ARE GOING TO LORD LONGTOWN'S NEAR HEREFORD FOR A FORTNIGHT
WHAT CAN HE WRITE ABOUT BUT YOURSELF YOU KNOW HE IS OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE WITH YOU WITH ME DEAR ISABELLA NAY MY SWEETEST CATHERINE THIS IS BEING QUITE ABSURD
NOW LEFT HER WITH I SHALL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING CATHERINE'S SWELLING HEART NEEDED RELIEF IN ELEANOR'S PRESENCE FRIENDSHIP AND PRIDE HAD EQUALLY RESTRAINED HER TEARS BUT NO SOONER WAS SHE GONE THAN THEY BURST FORTH IN TORRENTS
PROTESTING HER INNOCENCE OF EVERY THOUGHT OF MISTER THORPE'S BEING IN LOVE WITH HER AND THE CONSEQUENT IMPOSSIBILITY OF HER HAVING EVER INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE HIM
WHICH COMMANDED A TOLERABLE VIEW OF EVERYBODY ENTERING AT EITHER IT IS SO OUT OF THE WAY CATHERINE OBSERVING THAT ISABELLA'S EYES WERE CONTINUALLY BENT TOWARDS ONE DOOR OR THE OTHER AS IN EAGER EXPECTATION AND REMEMBERING HOW OFTEN
WE MAY EXPECT PHILOSOPHY FROM ALL THE WORLD MISS TILNEY WAS EARNEST THOUGH GENTLE IN HER SECONDARY CIVILITIES AND THE AFFAIR BECAME IN A FEW MINUTES AS NEARLY SETTLED AS THIS NECESSARY REFERENCE TO FULLERTON WOULD ALLOW
THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME CONCILIATORY MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL OCCURRED TO HER AS HIS DAUGHTER APPEARED
SO SOON AND SO SUDDENLY TOO BUT I AM NOT OFFENDED INDEED I AM NOT I CAN FINISH MY VISIT HERE YOU KNOW AT ANY TIME OR I HOPE YOU WILL COME TO ME CAN YOU WHEN YOU RETURN FROM THIS LORD'S COME TO FULLERTON
THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT SHOULD BE SO MEEKLY BORNE THE POWER OF EARLY HABIT ONLY COULD ACCOUNT FOR IT A DISTINCTION TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BORN GAVE NO PRIDE THEIR SUPERIORITY OF ABODE WAS NO MORE TO THEM THAN THEIR SUPERIORITY OF PERSON
HOWEVER IT IS NOT WORTH ARGUING ABOUT FOR WHATEVER MIGHT PASS ON HIS SIDE YOU MUST BE CONVINCED BY MY HAVING NO RECOLLECTION OF IT THAT I NEVER THOUGHT NOR EXPECTED NOR WISHED FOR ANYTHING OF THE KIND FROM HIM
HIS LOSS WAS NOT NOW WHAT IT HAD BEEN WHILE THE GENERAL WAS AT HOME
SHE WISHED ISABELLA HAD TALKED MORE LIKE HER USUAL SELF AND NOT SO MUCH ABOUT MONEY AND HAD NOT LOOKED SO WELL PLEASED AT THE SIGHT OF CAPTAIN TILNEY HOW STRANGE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT PERCEIVE HIS ADMIRATION
BUT I CONFESS AS SOON AS I READ HIS LETTER I THOUGHT IT A VERY FOOLISH IMPRUDENT BUSINESS AND NOT LIKELY TO PROMOTE THE GOOD OF EITHER FOR WHAT WERE YOU TO LIVE UPON SUPPOSING YOU CAME TOGETHER YOU HAVE BOTH OF YOU SOMETHING TO BE SURE
CATHERINE WALKED ON TO HER CHAMBER MAKING UP HER MIND AS WELL AS SHE COULD TO A FURTHER ACQUAINTANCE WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY AND COMFORTING HERSELF UNDER THE UNPLEASANT IMPRESSION HIS CONDUCT HAD GIVEN HER
A LETTER FROM MY STEWARD TELLS ME THAT MY PRESENCE IS WANTED AT HOME AND BEING DISAPPOINTED IN MY HOPE OF SEEING THE MARQUIS OF LONGTOWN AND GENERAL COURTENEY HERE SOME OF MY VERY OLD FRIENDS THERE IS NOTHING TO DETAIN ME LONGER IN BATH
AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST THIS ROOF WAS TO BE THE ROOF OF AN ABBEY HER PASSION FOR ANCIENT EDIFICES WAS NEXT IN DEGREE TO HER PASSION FOR HENRY TILNEY
AND THE DISTRESS IN WHICH SHE MUST HAVE BEEN THEREBY INVOLVED FILLING THE MINDS OF BOTH SCARCELY ANOTHER WORD WAS SAID BY EITHER DURING THE TIME OF THEIR REMAINING TOGETHER SHORT HOWEVER WAS THAT TIME THE CARRIAGE WAS SOON ANNOUNCED TO BE READY
MANY WERE THE INQUIRIES SHE WAS EAGER TO MAKE OF MISS TILNEY BUT SO ACTIVE WERE HER THOUGHTS THAT WHEN THESE INQUIRIES WERE ANSWERED SHE WAS HARDLY MORE ASSURED THAN BEFORE
THAN MISS TILNEY TOLD HER OF HER FATHER'S HAVING JUST DETERMINED UPON QUITTING BATH BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK HERE WAS A BLOW THE PAST SUSPENSE OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN EASE AND QUIET TO THE PRESENT DISAPPOINTMENT
AND CATHERINE INSTANTLY RISING A LONG AND AFFECTIONATE EMBRACE SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF LANGUAGE IN BIDDING EACH OTHER ADIEU AND AS THEY ENTERED THE HALL UNABLE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT SOME MENTION OF ONE WHOSE NAME HAD NOT YET BEEN SPOKEN BY EITHER
HER VOICE FALTERED AND HER EYES WERE TURNED TO THE GROUND AS SHE MENTIONED HIS NAME HIS UNLOOKED FOR RETURN WAS ENOUGH IN ITSELF TO MAKE CATHERINE'S HEART SINK
EVEN OF DECENT CIVILITY DEAR DEAR CATHERINE IN BEING THE BEARER OF SUCH A MESSAGE I SEEM GUILTY MYSELF OF ALL ITS INSULT YET
I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO MAKE THE REQUEST THOUGH
HER FEELINGS HER PREFERENCES HAD EACH KNOWN THE HAPPINESS OF A RETURN WHEREVER SHE FELT ATTACHMENT SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO CREATE IT THE AFFECTION OF ISABELLA WAS TO BE SECURED TO HER IN A SISTER THE TILNEYS
BUT CATHERINE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE THAT ANY INJURY OR ANY MISFORTUNE COULD PROVOKE SUCH ILL WILL AGAINST A PERSON NOT CONNECTED OR AT LEAST
YET NO ENDEAVOURS SHALL BE WANTING ON OUR SIDE TO MAKE NORTHANGER ABBEY NOT WHOLLY DISAGREEABLE NORTHANGER ABBEY THESE WERE THRILLING WORDS AND WOUND UP CATHERINE'S FEELINGS TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF ECSTASY
TILL SHE HAD HER LEAVING THEM WAS NOT EVEN TO BE THOUGHT OF IN HAVING THIS CAUSE OF UNEASINESS SO PLEASANTLY REMOVED THE FORCE OF THE OTHER WAS LIKEWISE WEAKENED THE KINDNESS THE EARNESTNESS OF ELEANOR'S MANNER IN PRESSING HER TO STAY
AND A STILL GREATER TO SPEAK WHEN THERE CATHERINE SUPPOSING SOME UNEASINESS ON CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ACCOUNT COULD ONLY EXPRESS HER CONCERN BY SILENT ATTENTION OBLIGED HER TO BE SEATED RUBBED HER TEMPLES WITH LAVENDER WATER
TURNED FROM THE HOUSE AND IN SUCH A WAY
TO START FORTH HER OBLIGATION OF GOING AWAY VERY SOON ELEANOR LOOKED AND DECLARED HERSELF MUCH CONCERNED SHE HAD HOPED FOR THE PLEASURE OF HER COMPANY FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME HAD BEEN MISLED PERHAPS BY HER WISHES
SO SOON AS MONDAY AND YOU ALL GO WELL I AM CERTAIN OF I SHALL BE ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE HOWEVER I NEED NOT GO TILL JUST BEFORE YOU DO YOU KNOW
AND COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT IF MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND WERE AWARE OF THE PLEASURE IT WAS TO HER TO HAVE HER THERE THEY WOULD BE TOO GENEROUS TO HASTEN HER RETURN CATHERINE EXPLAINED OH AS TO THAT
ALL THAT I KNOW ALL THAT I ANSWER FOR IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE GIVEN HIM NO JUST CAUSE OF OFFENCE HE CERTAINLY IS GREATLY VERY GREATLY DISCOMPOSED I HAVE SELDOM SEEN HIM MORE SO HIS TEMPER IS NOT HAPPY
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN IN THE PROPEREST WAY I WOULD NOT SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF A BROTHER OF YOURS ISABELLA I AM SURE BUT YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT IF I COULD THINK OF ONE MAN MORE THAN ANOTHER
AND COULD WE CARRY OUR SELFISH POINT WITH YOU WE SHOULD LEAVE IT WITHOUT A SINGLE REGRET CAN YOU IN SHORT BE PREVAILED ON TO QUIT THIS SCENE OF PUBLIC TRIUMPH AND OBLIGE YOUR FRIEND ELEANOR WITH YOUR COMPANY IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE
MY POOR HEAD I HAD QUITE FORGOT IT WELL THE THING IS THIS I HAVE JUST HAD A LETTER FROM JOHN YOU CAN GUESS THE CONTENTS NO INDEED I CANNOT MY SWEET LOVE
OR ALLOWING HER EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF CHOICE AS TO THE TIME OR MODE OF HER TRAVELLING OF TWO DAYS THE EARLIEST FIXED ON AND OF THAT ALMOST THE EARLIEST HOUR AS IF RESOLVED TO HAVE HER GONE BEFORE HE WAS STIRRING IN THE MORNING
HIS DEPARTURE GAVE CATHERINE THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL CONVICTION THAT A LOSS MAY BE SOMETIMES A GAIN THE HAPPINESS WITH WHICH THEIR TIME NOW PASSED EVERY EMPLOYMENT VOLUNTARY EVERY LAUGH INDULGED
I WILL TRUST TO YOUR OWN KINDNESS OF HEART WHEN I AM AT A DISTANCE FROM YOU BUT THIS WITH THE LOOK OF SORROW ACCOMPANYING IT WAS ENOUGH TO MELT CATHERINE'S PRIDE IN A MOMENT AND SHE INSTANTLY SAID OH ELEANOR I WILL WRITE TO YOU INDEED
MORE ENCOURAGEMENT THAN ONE WISHES TO STAND BY BUT YOU MAY BE ASSURED THAT I AM THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD TO JUDGE YOU SEVERELY ALL THOSE THINGS SHOULD BE ALLOWED FOR IN YOUTH AND HIGH SPIRITS WHAT ONE MEANS ONE DAY YOU KNOW ONE MAY NOT MEAN THE NEXT
HER CHIEF PROFIT WAS IN WONDER THAT HE SHOULD THINK IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO FANCY HIMSELF IN LOVE WITH HER WAS A MATTER OF LIVELY ASTONISHMENT
ISABELLA WAS SILENT MY DEAR FRIEND YOU MUST NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME I CANNOT SUPPOSE YOUR BROTHER CARES SO VERY MUCH ABOUT ME AND YOU KNOW WE SHALL STILL BE SISTERS
SHE HAD BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED OF BEING ARCH THOUGHT THE PRESENT A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR BEING REALLY SO AND THEREFORE GAILY SAID DO NOT BE UNEASY ISABELLA JAMES WILL SOON BE HERE PSHA MY DEAR CREATURE SHE REPLIED DO NOT THINK
BUT RESOLVING NOT TO BE AGAIN OVERCOME BY TRIVIAL APPEARANCES OF ALARM OR MISLED BY A RAISED IMAGINATION SHE STEPPED QUIETLY FORWARD AND OPENED THE DOOR ELEANOR AND ONLY ELEANOR STOOD THERE
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MORNING HAD LED CATHERINE'S FEELINGS THROUGH THE VARIETIES OF SUSPENSE SECURITY AND DISAPPOINTMENT BUT THEY WERE NOW SAFELY LODGED IN PERFECT BLISS AND WITH SPIRITS ELATED TO RAPTURE WITH HENRY AT HER HEART
MODESTY AND ALL THAT IS VERY WELL IN ITS WAY BUT REALLY A LITTLE COMMON HONESTY IS SOMETIMES QUITE AS BECOMING I HAVE NO IDEA OF BEING SO OVERSTRAINED IT IS FISHING FOR COMPLIMENTS HIS ATTENTIONS WERE SUCH AS A CHILD MUST HAVE NOTICED
BUT HOW CAN I TELL YOU TOMORROW MORNING IS FIXED FOR YOUR LEAVING US
THE ENGAGEMENTS OF HIS CURATE AT WOODSTON OBLIGING HIM TO LEAVE THEM ON SATURDAY
BUT IT IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE I HOPE I EARNESTLY HOPE THAT TO YOUR REAL SAFETY IT WILL BE OF NONE BUT TO EVERYTHING ELSE IT IS OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO COMFORT APPEARANCE PROPRIETY
FOUND THEMSELVES SO WELL SUFFICIENT FOR THE TIME TO THEMSELVES THAT IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK RATHER A LATE HOUR AT THE ABBEY BEFORE THEY QUITTED THE SUPPER ROOM ON THE DAY OF HENRY'S DEPARTURE THEY HAD JUST REACHED THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS WHEN IT SEEMED
THE VERY CARRIAGE IS ORDERED AND WILL BE HERE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK AND NO SERVANT WILL BE OFFERED YOU CATHERINE SAT DOWN BREATHLESS AND SPEECHLESS I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY SENSES WHEN I HEARD IT
AND HUNG OVER HER WITH AFFECTIONATE SOLICITUDE MY DEAR CATHERINE YOU MUST NOT YOU MUST NOT INDEED WERE ELEANOR'S FIRST CONNECTED WORDS I AM QUITE WELL THIS KINDNESS DISTRACTS ME
WHICH CATHERINE WAS BEGINNING TO HOPE MIGHT INTRODUCE A DESIRE OF THEIR CORRESPONDING AFTER ADDRESSING HER WITH HIS USUAL POLITENESS HE TURNED TO HIS DAUGHTER AND SAID WELL ELEANOR
AND STRENGTHENED HER DISTASTE FOR EVERYTHING BEFORE HER
WITH MUCH UNEASINESS DID SHE THUS LEAVE THEM IT SEEMED TO HER THAT CAPTAIN TILNEY WAS FALLING IN LOVE WITH ISABELLA AND ISABELLA UNCONSCIOUSLY ENCOURAGING HIM
BECAUSE HE IS MY BROTHER AND WHO PERHAPS AFTER ALL YOU KNOW MIGHT BE JUST AS HAPPY WITHOUT YOU FOR PEOPLE SELDOM KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD BE AT YOUNG MEN ESPECIALLY THEY ARE SO AMAZINGLY CHANGEABLE AND INCONSTANT
I TRUST YOU WILL ACQUIT ME FOR YOU MUST HAVE BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN THIS HOUSE TO SEE THAT I AM BUT A NOMINAL MISTRESS OF IT THAT MY REAL POWER IS NOTHING HAVE I OFFENDED THE GENERAL SAID CATHERINE IN A FALTERING VOICE
ELEANOR BROUGHT NO MESSAGE VERY LITTLE PASSED BETWEEN THEM ON MEETING
AND THEN TILL I CAN ASK FOR YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AS I OUGHT TO DO I WILL NOT EXPECT MORE DIRECT TO ME AT LORD LONGTOWN'S AND I MUST ASK IT UNDER COVER TO ALICE NO ELEANOR
IN FRIENDS AND FORTUNE CIRCUMSTANCE AND CHANCE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO COOPERATE FOR HER ADVANTAGE BY THE KINDNESS OF HER FIRST FRIENDS THE ALLENS SHE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED INTO SCENES WHERE PLEASURES OF EVERY KIND HAD MET HER
CATHERINE LINGERING ONLY HALF A MINUTE BEHIND HER FRIEND TO THROW A PARTING GLANCE ON EVERY WELL KNOWN CHERISHED OBJECT AND WENT DOWN TO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR WHERE BREAKFAST WAS PREPARED
IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING WHICH SAW THIS BUSINESS ARRANGED SHE VISITED MISS TILNEY AND POURED FORTH HER JOYFUL FEELINGS IT WAS DOOMED TO BE A DAY OF TRIAL NO SOONER HAD SHE EXPRESSED HER DELIGHT IN MISTER ALLEN'S LENGTHENED STAY
HE APPROACHED IMMEDIATELY AND TOOK THE SEAT TO WHICH HER MOVEMENTS INVITED HIM HIS FIRST ADDRESS MADE CATHERINE START THOUGH SPOKEN LOW SHE COULD DISTINGUISH WHAT
TO YOUR FAMILY TO THE WORLD WERE YOUR FRIENDS THE ALLENS STILL IN BATH YOU MIGHT GO TO THEM WITH COMPARATIVE EASE A FEW HOURS WOULD TAKE YOU THERE BUT A JOURNEY OF SEVENTY MILES TO BE TAKEN POST BY YOU AT YOUR AGE ALONE UNATTENDED
WERE FELT AND CONSIDERED WITHOUT THE SMALLEST EMOTION AND THOUGH THE WIND WAS HIGH AND OFTEN PRODUCED STRANGE AND SUDDEN NOISES THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE SHE HEARD IT ALL AS SHE LAY AWAKE HOUR AFTER HOUR WITHOUT CURIOSITY OR TERROR
FROM WHAT IT COULD ARISE AND WHERE IT WOULD END WERE CONSIDERATIONS OF EQUAL PERPLEXITY AND ALARM THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS DONE SO GROSSLY UNCIVIL HURRYING HER AWAY WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO HER OWN CONVENIENCE
PERHAPS SAID MISS TILNEY IN AN EMBARRASSED MANNER YOU WOULD BE SO GOOD IT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY IF THE ENTRANCE OF HER FATHER PUT A STOP TO THE CIVILITY
WHAT THIS ADDITIONAL FORTNIGHT
WHAT I SAY IS WHY SHOULD A BROTHER'S HAPPINESS BE DEARER TO ME THAN A FRIEND'S YOU KNOW I CARRY MY NOTIONS OF FRIENDSHIP PRETTY HIGH
AH HERE HE COMES NEVER MIND HE WILL NOT SEE US I AM SURE CATHERINE LOOKING UP PERCEIVED CAPTAIN TILNEY AND ISABELLA EARNESTLY FIXING HER EYE ON HIM AS SHE SPOKE SOON CAUGHT HIS NOTICE
HER GRATEFUL AND GRATIFIED HEART COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN ITS EXPRESSIONS WITHIN THE LANGUAGE OF TOLERABLE CALMNESS TO RECEIVE SO FLATTERING AN INVITATION TO HAVE HER COMPANY SO WARMLY SOLICITED
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THAT IF YOU ARE IN TOO GREAT A HURRY YOU WILL CERTAINLY LIVE TO REPENT IT
MY DEAR ELEANOR CRIED CATHERINE SUPPRESSING HER FEELINGS AS WELL AS SHE COULD DO NOT BE SO DISTRESSED A SECOND ENGAGEMENT MUST GIVE WAY TO A FIRST
AND IT WAS BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE LEFT BATH THAT YOU GAVE HIM THE MOST POSITIVE ENCOURAGEMENT HE SAYS SO IN THIS LETTER SAYS THAT HE AS GOOD AS MADE YOU AN OFFER
THERE COULD BE NO DANGER OF IT AND AS LONG AS ALL MENTION OF BATH SCENES WERE AVOIDED SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD BEHAVE TO HIM VERY CIVILLY IN SUCH CONSIDERATIONS TIME PASSED AWAY
THOUGH SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED IN SPEAKING OF IT HAD OCCURRED TO HER THAT AFTER SO LONG AN ABSENCE FROM HOME CATHERINE MIGHT NOT BE PROVIDED WITH MONEY ENOUGH FOR THE EXPENSES OF HER JOURNEY AND UPON SUGGESTING IT TO HER WITH MOST AFFECTIONATE OFFERS OF ACCOMMODATION
EVERYTHING HONOURABLE AND SOOTHING EVERY PRESENT ENJOYMENT AND EVERY FUTURE HOPE WAS CONTAINED IN IT
SOON AFTER SIX ELEANOR ENTERED HER ROOM EAGER TO SHOW ATTENTION OR GIVE ASSISTANCE WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE BUT VERY LITTLE REMAINED TO BE DONE
BUT IT IS NOT A TRIFLE THAT WILL SUPPORT A FAMILY NOWADAYS AND AFTER ALL THAT ROMANCERS MAY SAY THERE IS NO DOING WITHOUT MONEY I ONLY WONDER JOHN COULD THINK OF IT HE COULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED MY LAST YOU DO ACQUIT ME THEN OF ANYTHING WRONG
THOUGH EVIDENTLY INTENDING TO COME IN
GENERAL TILNEY WAS NOT LESS SANGUINE HAVING ALREADY WAITED ON HER EXCELLENT FRIENDS IN PULTENEY STREET AND OBTAINED THEIR SANCTION OF HIS WISHES SINCE THEY CAN CONSENT TO PART WITH YOU SAID HE
SINCE THAT IS THE CASE I AM SURE I SHALL NOT TEASE YOU ANY FURTHER
AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PUMP ROOM ONE MORNING BY MISSUS ALLEN'S SIDE WITHOUT ANYTHING TO SAY OR TO HEAR AND SCARCELY HAD SHE FELT A FIVE MINUTES LONGING OF FRIENDSHIP BEFORE THE OBJECT OF IT APPEARED
THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME MY HEART INDEED WHAT CAN YOU HAVE TO DO WITH HEARTS YOU MEN HAVE NONE OF YOU ANY HEARTS IF WE HAVE NOT HEARTS WE HAVE EYES AND THEY GIVE US TORMENT ENOUGH
HER ANXIETY HAD FOUNDATION IN FACT HER FEARS IN PROBABILITY AND WITH A MIND SO OCCUPIED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF ACTUAL AND NATURAL EVIL THE SOLITUDE OF HER SITUATION THE DARKNESS OF HER CHAMBER THE ANTIQUITY OF THE BUILDING
WORSE TO BE TOLD SHE SAID NOTHING AND ELEANOR ENDEAVOURING TO COLLECT HERSELF AND SPEAK WITH FIRMNESS BUT WITH EYES STILL CAST DOWN SOON WENT ON YOU ARE TOO GOOD I AM SURE
THAN YOURSELF MODESTY SUCH AS YOURS BUT NOT FOR THE WORLD WOULD I PAIN IT BY OPEN PRAISE IF YOU CAN BE INDUCED TO HONOUR US WITH A VISIT YOU WILL MAKE US HAPPY BEYOND EXPRESSION TIS TRUE
AS FAR AS THE THICKNESS OF THE WALLS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO JUDGE THAT A CARRIAGE WAS DRIVING UP TO THE DOOR AND THE NEXT MOMENT CONFIRMED THE IDEA BY THE LOUD NOISE OF THE HOUSE BELL AFTER THE FIRST PERTURBATION OF SURPRISE HAD PASSED AWAY
TO APPROVE OF HER THAT AT LEAST THEY SHOULD NOT MEET UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS WOULD MAKE THEIR MEETING MATERIALLY PAINFUL SHE TRUSTED HE WOULD NEVER SPEAK OF MISS THORPE AND INDEED AS HE MUST BY THIS TIME BE ASHAMED OF THE PART HE HAD ACTED
MY DAUGHTER MISS MORLAND HE CONTINUED WITHOUT LEAVING HIS DAUGHTER TIME TO SPEAK HAS BEEN FORMING A VERY BOLD WISH WE LEAVE BATH AS SHE HAS PERHAPS TOLD YOU ON SATURDAY
PROPOSE GOING AWAY AND BE GUIDED IN HER CONDUCT BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HER PROPOSAL MIGHT BE TAKEN AWARE THAT IF SHE GAVE HERSELF MUCH TIME SHE MIGHT FEEL IT DIFFICULT TO BRING FORWARD SO UNPLEASANT A SUBJECT
AT THAT MOMENT CATHERINE THOUGHT SHE HEARD HER STEP IN THE GALLERY AND LISTENED FOR ITS CONTINUANCE BUT ALL WAS SILENT SCARCELY HOWEVER HAD SHE CONVICTED HER FANCY OF ERROR WHEN THE NOISE OF SOMETHING MOVING CLOSE TO HER DOOR MADE HER START
FOR ONE LETTER AT ALL RISKS ALL HAZARDS I MUST ENTREAT
CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE OPINIONS ALTER BUT MY OPINION OF YOUR BROTHER NEVER DID ALTER IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME YOU ARE DESCRIBING WHAT NEVER HAPPENED MY DEAREST CATHERINE CONTINUED THE OTHER WITHOUT AT ALL LISTENING TO HER
WITH ALL THE CHANCES AGAINST HER OF HOUSE HALL PLACE PARK COURT AND COTTAGE NORTHANGER TURNED UP AN ABBEY AND SHE WAS TO BE ITS INHABITANT ITS LONG DAMP PASSAGES ITS NARROW CELLS
TILNEY SAYS IT IS ALWAYS THE CASE WITH MINDS OF A CERTAIN STAMP BUT I THOUGHT ISABELLA YOU HAD SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR TO TELL ME OH YES AND SO I HAVE BUT HERE IS A PROOF OF WHAT I WAS SAYING
OH BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN THERE SO LONG NAY IF YOU CAN USE SUCH A WORD I CAN URGE YOU NO FARTHER IF YOU THINK IT LONG OH NO I DO NOT INDEED
THEY BY WHOM ABOVE ALL SHE DESIRED TO BE FAVOURABLY THOUGHT OF OUTSTRIPPED EVEN HER WISHES IN THE FLATTERING MEASURES BY WHICH THEIR INTIMACY WAS TO BE CONTINUED SHE WAS TO BE THEIR CHOSEN VISITOR
THE COMPLIMENT OF JOHN THORPE'S AFFECTION DID NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR THIS THOUGHTLESSNESS IN HIS SISTER SHE WAS ALMOST AS FAR FROM BELIEVING AS FROM WISHING IT TO BE SINCERE FOR SHE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT HE COULD MISTAKE
SHE ROSE UP AND SAYING SHE SHOULD JOIN MISSUS ALLEN PROPOSED THEIR WALKING BUT FOR THIS ISABELLA SHOWED NO INCLINATION SHE WAS SO AMAZINGLY TIRED AND IT WAS SO ODIOUS TO PARADE ABOUT THE PUMP ROOM AND IF SHE MOVED FROM HER SEAT SHE SHOULD MISS HER SISTERS
IN A GOOD HEAVEN WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER IT WAS QUICKLY DECIDED BY ELEANOR TO BE HER ELDEST BROTHER WHOSE ARRIVAL WAS OFTEN AS SUDDEN IF NOT QUITE SO UNSEASONABLE AND ACCORDINGLY SHE HURRIED DOWN TO WELCOME HIM
TO THINK THE WORSE OF ME FOR THE PART I AM OBLIGED TO PERFORM I AM INDEED A MOST UNWILLING MESSENGER AFTER WHAT HAS SO LATELY PASSED SO LATELY BEEN SETTLED BETWEEN US HOW JOYFULLY HOW THANKFULLY ON MY SIDE
AND AN APPREHENSION OF NOT BEING EQUALLY BELOVED BY THE OTHER SHE WOULD AT EACH MOMENT OF EACH DAY HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY BUT SHE WAS NOW IN THE FOURTH WEEK OF HER VISIT BEFORE THE GENERAL CAME HOME
I CANNOT BEAR IT I COME TO YOU ON SUCH AN ERRAND ERRAND TO ME HOW SHALL I TELL YOU OH HOW SHALL I TELL YOU A NEW IDEA NOW DARTED INTO CATHERINE'S MIND
MADE BUT A SMALL PART OF CATHERINE'S SPECULATION ONCE OR TWICE INDEED SINCE JAMES'S ENGAGEMENT HAD TAUGHT HER WHAT COULD BE DONE SHE HAD GOT SO FAR AS TO INDULGE IN A SECRET PERHAPS
I WOULD NOT FOR ALL THE WORLD BE THE MEANS OF HURRYING YOU INTO AN ENGAGEMENT BEFORE YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT I DO NOT THINK ANYTHING WOULD JUSTIFY ME IN WISHING YOU TO SACRIFICE ALL YOUR HAPPINESS MERELY TO OBLIGE MY BROTHER
WAS AN EVIL WHICH NOTHING COULD COUNTERBALANCE HER WHOLE HAPPINESS SEEMED AT STAKE WHILE THE AFFAIR WAS IN SUSPENSE
CATHERINE'S COUNTENANCE FELL AND IN A VOICE OF MOST SINCERE CONCERN SHE ECHOED MISS TILNEY'S CONCLUDING WORDS BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK
AS TO YOUR CONTINUING HERE AS I HOPED FOR MANY MANY WEEKS LONGER HOW CAN I TELL YOU THAT YOUR KINDNESS IS NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AND THAT THE HAPPINESS YOUR COMPANY HAS HITHERTO GIVEN US IS TO BE REPAID BY
YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT I NEVER MEANT TO DECEIVE YOUR BROTHER NEVER SUSPECTED HIM OF LIKING ME TILL THIS MOMENT OH AS TO THAT ANSWERED ISABELLA LAUGHINGLY
WHO COULD SAY WHEN THEY MIGHT MEET AGAIN AND ALL THIS BY SUCH A MAN AS GENERAL TILNEY SO POLITE SO WELL BRED AND HERETOFORE SO PARTICULARLY FOND OF HER IT WAS AS INCOMPREHENSIBLE AS IT WAS MORTIFYING AND GRIEVOUS
I AM EXCESSIVELY CONCERNED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE ANY REGARD FOR ME BUT INDEED IT HAS BEEN QUITE UNINTENTIONAL ON MY SIDE I NEVER HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF IT PRAY UNDECEIVE HIM AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND TELL HIM I BEG HIS PARDON THAT IS
SHE WAS EXPECTING HER SISTERS EVERY MOMENT SO THAT HER DEAREST CATHERINE MUST EXCUSE HER AND MUST SIT QUIETLY DOWN AGAIN BUT CATHERINE COULD BE STUBBORN TOO AND MISSUS ALLEN JUST THEN COMING UP TO PROPOSE THEIR RETURNING HOME
WE CAN OFFER YOU NOTHING LIKE THE GAIETIES OF THIS LIVELY PLACE WE CAN TEMPT YOU NEITHER BY AMUSEMENT NOR SPLENDOUR FOR OUR MODE OF LIVING AS YOU SEE IS PLAIN AND UNPRETENDING
AND HIS ASSERTION OF THE OFFER AND OF HER ENCOURAGEMENT CONVINCED HER THAT HIS MISTAKES COULD SOMETIMES BE VERY EGREGIOUS IN VANITY THEREFORE
ME SUCH A SIMPLETON AS TO BE ALWAYS WANTING TO CONFINE HIM TO MY ELBOW IT WOULD BE HIDEOUS TO BE ALWAYS TOGETHER WE SHOULD BE THE JEST OF THE PLACE AND SO YOU ARE GOING TO NORTHANGER I AM AMAZINGLY GLAD OF IT
AND SHE DID NOT LOVE THE SIGHT OF JAPAN IN ANY SHAPE BUT EVEN SHE COULD ALLOW THAT AN OCCASIONAL MEMENTO OF PAST FOLLY HOWEVER PAINFUL MIGHT NOT BE WITHOUT USE
I AM SURE I SHOULD BE VERY SORRY TO LEAVE YOU SO SOON BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED THAT WOULD MAKE IT VERY DREADFUL FOR ME TO BE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH CAPTAIN TILNEY ELEANOR'S WORK WAS SUSPENDED WHILE SHE GAZED WITH INCREASING ASTONISHMENT
WHAT IS MOST TO THE CREDIT OF HUMAN NATURE SUCH FEELINGS OUGHT TO BE INVESTIGATED THAT THEY MAY KNOW THEMSELVES
I HEMMED THE EDGES OVER AGAIN WITH WHAT WITH THIS NEEDLE SAID THE ABBE AS OPENING HIS RAGGED VESTMENTS HE SHOWED DANTES A LONG SHARP FISH BONE WITH A SMALL PERFORATED EYE FOR THE THREAD A SMALL PORTION OF WHICH STILL REMAINED IN IT
THAN IF I POSSESSED A WATCH FOR THAT MIGHT BE BROKEN OR DERANGED IN ITS MOVEMENTS WHILE THE SUN AND EARTH NEVER VARY IN THEIR APPOINTED PATHS THIS LAST EXPLANATION WAS WHOLLY LOST UPON DANTES WHO HAD ALWAYS IMAGINED
AND CAPABLE AS HERETOFORE OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT BY ANYTHING HE SAID THERE WERE STILL SOME SUBJECTS INDEED UNDER WHICH SHE BELIEVED THEY MUST ALWAYS TREMBLE THE MENTION OF A CHEST OR A CABINET FOR INSTANCE
SERVING AS A SAFE DEPOSITORY OF THE ARTICLES MENTIONED TO DANTES
ASKED THE ABBE OH YOUR GREAT WORK ON THE MONARCHY OF ITALY
CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED HENRY'S ADDRESS SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE
BUT SHE LEARNED TO HOPE THAT IT WOULD NEVER TRANSPIRE FARTHER AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT COST HER HENRY'S ENTIRE REGARD HER THOUGHTS BEING STILL CHIEFLY FIXED ON WHAT SHE HAD WITH SUCH CAUSELESS TERROR FELT AND DONE NOTHING COULD SHORTLY BE CLEARER
YOU THINK IT IS ALL FOR AMBITION THEN AND UPON MY WORD THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT SEEM VERY LIKE IT I CANNOT FORGET THAT WHEN SHE FIRST KNEW WHAT MY FATHER WOULD DO FOR THEM SHE SEEMED QUITE DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT MORE
THAT I AM NEVER TO HEAR FROM HER PERHAPS NEVER TO SEE HER AGAIN
DEAREST CATHERINE BEWARE HOW YOU GIVE YOUR HEART
AS WELL AS MAKE OUT THE SENSE IT BEING IN ITALIAN
I WOULD FAIN FIX THE SOURCE OF IT ON MAN THAT I MAY NO LONGER VENT REPROACHES UPON HEAVEN
NO I THANK YOU SIGHING AS SHE SPOKE THEY ARE ALL VERY WELL MY LETTER WAS FROM MY BROTHER AT OXFORD NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN SPEAKING THROUGH HER TEARS SHE ADDED
ONE COULD CUT AND THRUST DANTES EXAMINED THE VARIOUS ARTICLES SHOWN TO HIM WITH THE SAME ATTENTION THAT HE HAD BESTOWED ON THE CURIOSITIES AND STRANGE TOOLS EXHIBITED IN THE SHOPS AT MARSEILLES
TILL THE VERY LAST IF I REASONED WITH HER SHE DECLARED HERSELF AS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME AS EVER
SO THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINISH MY WORK HERE AND WAS IT NOT DISCOVERED THAT YOUR SHEETS WERE UNHEMMED
APPEARED TO HIM PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE EACH WORD THAT FELL FROM HIS COMPANION'S LIPS SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH THE MYSTERIES OF SCIENCE AS WORTHY OF DIGGING OUT AS THE GOLD AND DIAMONDS IN THE MINES OF GUZERAT AND GOLCONDA
NIGHT WHY FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE ARE YOUR EYES LIKE CATS THAT YOU CAN SEE TO WORK IN THE DARK INDEED THEY ARE NOT BUT GOD HAS SUPPLIED MAN WITH THE INTELLIGENCE THAT ENABLES HIM TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF NATURAL CONDITIONS
I SHALL NOT ENTER INTO PARTICULARS THEY WOULD ONLY PAIN YOU MORE YOU WILL SOON HEAR ENOUGH FROM ANOTHER QUARTER TO KNOW WHERE LIES THE BLAME
AND SHORT EXCLAMATIONS OF SORROWING WONDER DECLARED HER TO BE RECEIVING UNPLEASANT NEWS AND HENRY EARNESTLY WATCHING HER THROUGH THE WHOLE LETTER SAW PLAINLY THAT IT ENDED NO BETTER THAN IT BEGAN HE WAS PREVENTED HOWEVER
SHOWING TO THE YOUNG MAN A SLENDER STICK ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG AND MUCH RESEMBLING THE SIZE OF THE HANDLE OF A FINE PAINTING BRUSH TO THE END OF WHICH WAS TIED BY A PIECE OF THREAD
AND EVERYTHING THAT IS BAD IN THE WORLD I HOPE SO FAR AS CONCERNS MY BROTHER YOU ARE MISINFORMED I HOPE HE HAS NOT HAD ANY MATERIAL SHARE IN BRINGING ON MISTER MORLAND'S DISAPPOINTMENT
AND EVEN OF THAT IF HARD PRESSED WOULD HAVE YIELDED THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN EXTREMITIES BUT IN THE CENTRAL PART OF ENGLAND THERE WAS SURELY SOME SECURITY FOR THE EXISTENCE EVEN OF A WIFE NOT BELOVED IN THE LAWS OF THE LAND AND THE MANNERS OF THE AGE
HIS MARRYING MISS THORPE IS NOT PROBABLE I THINK YOU MUST BE DECEIVED SO FAR I AM VERY SORRY FOR MISTER MORLAND SORRY THAT ANYONE YOU LOVE SHOULD BE UNHAPPY BUT MY SURPRISE WOULD BE GREATER
SUCH A FRIEND AS ISABELLA HAD BEEN TO HER AND THEN THEIR OWN BROTHER SO CLOSELY CONCERNED IN IT SHE BELIEVED SHE MUST WAIVE THE SUBJECT ALTOGETHER HENRY AND ELEANOR WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND EACH AS SHE ENTERED IT
THE FORMIDABLE HENRY SOON FOLLOWED HER INTO THE ROOM AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO HER WAS THAT HE PAID HER RATHER MORE ATTENTION THAN USUAL CATHERINE HAD NEVER WANTED COMFORT MORE AND HE LOOKED AS IF HE WAS AWARE OF IT
HER ONLY DEPENDENCE FOR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WAS ON ISABELLA JAMES HAD PROTESTED AGAINST WRITING TO HER TILL HIS RETURN TO OXFORD AND MISSUS ALLEN HAD GIVEN HER NO HOPES OF A LETTER TILL SHE HAD GOT BACK TO FULLERTON
YOU LITTLE THOUGHT OF ITS ENDING SO ISABELLA NO WONDER NOW I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HER ISABELLA HAS DESERTED MY BROTHER AND IS TO MARRY YOURS COULD YOU HAVE BELIEVED THERE HAD BEEN SUCH INCONSTANCY AND FICKLENESS
SHE HATED HERSELF MORE THAN SHE COULD EXPRESS HE HAD SHE THOUGHT HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE THIS FATAL MORNING SHOWN SOMETHING LIKE AFFECTION FOR HER BUT NOW
YOU MUST BE BLESSED INDEED TO POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE THE ABBE SMILED WELL SAID HE BUT YOU HAD ANOTHER SUBJECT FOR YOUR THOUGHTS DID YOU NOT SAY SO JUST NOW I DID
AND WHICH SUDDEN CHANCE FREQUENTLY BRINGS ABOUT WHILE AFFECTING TO BE DEEPLY ENGAGED IN EXAMINING THE LADDER THE MIND OF DANTES WAS IN FACT BUSILY OCCUPIED BY THE IDEA
THERE SUCH AS WERE NOT AS SPOTLESS AS AN ANGEL MIGHT HAVE THE DISPOSITIONS OF A FIEND BUT IN ENGLAND IT WAS NOT SO AMONG THE ENGLISH SHE BELIEVED IN THEIR HEARTS AND HABITS
FROM EVEN LOOKING HIS SURPRISE BY HIS FATHER'S ENTRANCE THEY WENT TO BREAKFAST DIRECTLY BUT CATHERINE COULD HARDLY EAT ANYTHING TEARS FILLED HER EYES AND EVEN RAN DOWN HER CHEEKS AS SHE SAT THE LETTER WAS ONE MOMENT IN HER HAND
AS THOUGH OVERWHELMED BY THE PERSEVERANCE AND STRENGTH OF FARIA'S MIND YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ALL YET CONTINUED FARIA FOR I DID NOT THINK IT WISE TO TRUST ALL MY TREASURES IN THE SAME HIDING PLACE LET US SHUT THIS ONE UP
AS SOON AS SHE DARED LEAVE THE TABLE SHE HURRIED AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM BUT THE HOUSEMAIDS WERE BUSY IN IT AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO COME DOWN AGAIN SHE TURNED INTO THE DRAWING ROOM FOR PRIVACY BUT HENRY AND ELEANOR HAD LIKEWISE RETREATED THITHER
UPON SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO BE NOT PERFECTLY AMIABLE HER MIND MADE UP ON THESE SEVERAL POINTS AND HER RESOLUTION FORMED OF ALWAYS JUDGING AND ACTING IN FUTURE WITH THE GREATEST GOOD SENSE
THE LIBERTY WHICH HER IMAGINATION HAD DARED TO TAKE WITH THE CHARACTER OF HIS FATHER COULD HE EVER FORGIVE IT THE ABSURDITY OF HER CURIOSITY AND HER FEARS COULD THEY EVER BE FORGOTTEN
SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO FORGIVE HERSELF AND BE HAPPIER THAN EVER AND THE LENIENT HAND OF TIME DID MUCH FOR HER BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS IN THE COURSE OF ANOTHER DAY HENRY'S ASTONISHING GENEROSITY
HIS ARREST AND SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION HIS TEMPORARY DETENTION AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE AND HIS FINAL IMPRISONMENT IN THE CHATEAU D'IF FROM THIS POINT EVERYTHING WAS A BLANK TO DANTES HE KNEW NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE LENGTH OF TIME HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED
WHAT SHE WOULD BE AT FOR THERE COULD BE NO NEED OF MY BEING PLAYED OFF TO MAKE HER SECURE OF TILNEY WE PARTED AT LAST BY MUTUAL CONSENT HAPPY FOR ME HAD WE NEVER MET
AS YET BUT ONE OF THEM LET ME HEAR THE OTHER IT WAS THIS THAT WHILE YOU HAD RELATED TO ME ALL THE PARTICULARS OF YOUR PAST LIFE YOU WERE PERFECTLY UNACQUAINTED WITH MINE YOUR LIFE MY YOUNG FRIEND HAS NOT BEEN OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH
IN A STATE OF FREEDOM HAVE EVAPORATED IN A THOUSAND FOLLIES MISFORTUNE IS NEEDED TO BRING TO LIGHT THE TREASURES OF THE HUMAN INTELLECT COMPRESSION IS NEEDED TO EXPLODE GUNPOWDER CAPTIVITY HAS BROUGHT MY MENTAL FACULTIES TO A FOCUS
MURDER WAS NOT TOLERATED SERVANTS WERE NOT SLAVES AND NEITHER POISON NOR SLEEPING POTIONS TO BE PROCURED LIKE RHUBARB FROM EVERY DRUGGIST AMONG THE ALPS AND PYRENEES PERHAPS THERE WERE NO MIXED CHARACTERS
THEY PUT THE STONE BACK IN ITS PLACE THE ABBE SPRINKLED A LITTLE DUST OVER IT TO CONCEAL THE TRACES OF ITS HAVING BEEN REMOVED RUBBED HIS FOOT WELL ON IT TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE SAME APPEARANCE AS THE OTHER AND THEN GOING TOWARDS HIS BED
LET ME SOON HEAR FROM YOU DEAR CATHERINE YOU ARE MY ONLY FRIEND YOUR LOVE I DO BUILD UPON I WISH YOUR VISIT AT NORTHANGER MAY BE OVER BEFORE CAPTAIN TILNEY MAKES HIS ENGAGEMENT KNOWN
LONG BEFORE HER QUITTING BATH AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE MIGHT BE TRACED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THAT SORT OF READING WHICH SHE HAD THERE INDULGED
I WROTE THE WORD FINIS AT THE END OF THE SIXTY EIGHTH STRIP ABOUT A WEEK AGO I HAVE TORN UP TWO OF MY SHIRTS AND AS MANY HANDKERCHIEFS AS I WAS MASTER OF TO COMPLETE THE PRECIOUS PAGES
HOWEVER I DISCOVERED THAT I SHOULD MERELY HAVE DROPPED INTO A SORT OF INNER COURT AND I THEREFORE RENOUNCED THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER AS TOO FULL OF RISK AND DANGER NEVERTHELESS I CAREFULLY PRESERVED MY LADDER
AFTER ELEANOR HAD AFFECTIONATELY EXPRESSED A WISH OF BEING OF USE OR COMFORT TO HER AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S FREE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF AND REFLECTION CATHERINE FELT EQUAL TO ENCOUNTERING HER FRIENDS
LOOKED AT HER ANXIOUSLY CATHERINE TOOK HER PLACE AT THE TABLE AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ELEANOR SAID NO BAD NEWS FROM FULLERTON I HOPE MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS I HOPE THEY ARE NONE OF THEM ILL
I TOLD YOU HOW I MANAGED TO OBTAIN THAT AND I ONLY JUST MAKE IT FROM TIME TO TIME AS I REQUIRE IT ONE THING STILL PUZZLES ME OBSERVED DANTES AND THAT IS HOW YOU MANAGED TO DO ALL THIS BY DAYLIGHT
ARTLESS GUILELESS WITH AFFECTIONS STRONG BUT SIMPLE FORMING NO PRETENSIONS AND KNOWING NO DISGUISE SUCH A SISTER IN LAW HENRY I SHOULD DELIGHT IN SAID ELEANOR WITH A SMILE
I FURNISHED MYSELF WITH A LIGHT
IT IS ALL OVER WITH FREDERICK INDEED HE IS A DECEASED MAN DEFUNCT IN UNDERSTANDING PREPARE FOR YOUR SISTER IN LAW ELEANOR AND SUCH A SISTER IN LAW AS YOU MUST DELIGHT IN OPEN CANDID
I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE YOUR TREASURES THE ABBE SMILED AND PROCEEDING TO THE DISUSED FIREPLACE RAISED BY THE HELP OF HIS CHISEL A LONG STONE WHICH HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN THE HEARTH BENEATH WHICH WAS A CAVITY OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH
THE EVENING WORE AWAY WITH NO ABATEMENT OF THIS SOOTHING POLITENESS AND HER SPIRITS WERE GRADUALLY RAISED TO A MODEST TRANQUILLITY SHE DID NOT LEARN EITHER TO FORGET OR DEFEND THE PAST
OR YOU WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLY CIRCUMSTANCED POOR THORPE IS IN TOWN I DREAD THE SIGHT OF HIM HIS HONEST HEART WOULD FEEL SO MUCH I HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM AND MY FATHER HER DUPLICITY HURTS ME MORE THAN ALL
AS THE WORKS OF THE SAVAGES IN THE SOUTH SEAS FROM WHENCE THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT BY THE DIFFERENT TRADING VESSELS AS FOR THE INK
IN SHORT SHE MADE HERSELF AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WENT DOWN WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK FIVE WITH A BROKEN HEART AND COULD SCARCELY GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ANSWER TO ELEANOR'S INQUIRY IF SHE WAS WELL
IT CONTAINED SOMETHING WORSE THAN ANYBODY COULD SUPPOSE POOR JAMES IS SO UNHAPPY YOU WILL SOON KNOW WHY TO HAVE SO KIND HEARTED SO AFFECTIONATE A SISTER REPLIED HENRY WARMLY MUST BE A COMFORT TO HIM UNDER ANY DISTRESS
OF WHICH DANTES HAD WITNESSED THE COMPLETION AS HE ENTERED THE CHAMBER OF HIS FRIEND DANTES CAST AROUND ONE EAGER AND SEARCHING GLANCE IN QUEST OF THE EXPECTED MARVELS BUT NOTHING MORE THAN COMMON MET HIS VIEW IT IS WELL
MY FATHER AND MERCEDES COME SAID THE ABBE CLOSING HIS HIDING PLACE AND PUSHING THE BED BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL SITUATION LET ME HEAR YOUR STORY DANTES OBEYED AND COMMENCED WHAT HE CALLED HIS HISTORY
AND NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT IN NEVER ALLUDING IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY TO WHAT HAD PASSED WAS OF THE GREATEST ASSISTANCE TO HER AND SOONER THAN SHE COULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HER DISTRESS HER SPIRITS BECAME ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE
NOW LET ME BEHOLD THE CURIOUS PENS WITH WHICH YOU HAVE WRITTEN YOUR WORK LOOK
I HAVE ONE FAVOUR TO BEG SAID CATHERINE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS IN AN AGITATED MANNER THAT IF YOUR BROTHER SHOULD BE COMING HERE YOU WILL GIVE ME NOTICE OF IT THAT I MAY GO AWAY OUR BROTHER FREDERICK YES
WHO SUPPLIED YOU WITH THE MATERIALS FOR MAKING THIS WONDERFUL WORK I TORE UP SEVERAL OF MY SHIRTS AND RIPPED OUT THE SEAMS IN THE SHEETS OF MY BED DURING MY THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT AT FENESTRELLE
WHICH HE COULD JUST RECOLLECT HAVING VISITED DURING A VOYAGE MADE IN HIS EARLIEST YOUTH
THANK GOD I AM UNDECEIVED IN TIME BUT IT IS A HEAVY BLOW AFTER MY FATHER'S CONSENT HAD BEEN SO KINDLY GIVEN BUT NO MORE OF THIS SHE HAS MADE ME MISERABLE FOREVER
JAMES ONLY MEANS TO GIVE ME GOOD ADVICE HE GLADLY RECEIVED THE LETTER AND HAVING READ IT THROUGH WITH CLOSE ATTENTION RETURNED IT SAYING WELL IF IT IS TO BE SO I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I AM SORRY FOR IT
SHE THANKED HIM AS HEARTILY AS IF HE HAD WRITTEN IT HIMSELF TIS ONLY FROM JAMES HOWEVER AS SHE LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION SHE OPENED IT IT WAS FROM OXFORD AND TO THIS PURPOSE DEAR CATHERINE
SHOULD I EVER GET OUT OF PRISON AND FIND IN ALL ITALY A PRINTER COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO PUBLISH WHAT I HAVE COMPOSED MY LITERARY REPUTATION IS FOREVER SECURED I SEE ANSWERED DANTES
WOULD IT BE TO PROMOTE HIS HAPPINESS TO ENABLE HIM TO MARRY SUCH A GIRL SHE MUST BE AN UNPRINCIPLED ONE OR SHE COULD NOT HAVE USED YOUR BROTHER SO AND HOW STRANGE AN INFATUATION ON FREDERICK'S SIDE A GIRL
YOU WOULD NOT FOR INSTANCE NOW GO TO A BALL FOR THE WORLD YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE NO LONGER ANY FRIEND TO WHOM YOU CAN SPEAK WITH UNRESERVE ON WHOSE REGARD YOU CAN PLACE DEPENDENCE OR WHOSE COUNSEL
I NEVER WAS SO DECEIVED IN ANYONE'S CHARACTER IN MY LIFE BEFORE AMONG ALL THE GREAT VARIETY THAT YOU HAVE KNOWN AND STUDIED MY OWN DISAPPOINTMENT AND LOSS IN HER IS VERY GREAT BUT AS FOR POOR JAMES
BUT HENRY BEGAN TO SUSPECT THE TRUTH AND SOMETHING IN WHICH MISS THORPE'S NAME WAS INCLUDED PASSED HIS LIPS HOW QUICK YOU ARE CRIED CATHERINE YOU HAVE GUESSED IT I DECLARE AND YET WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT IT IN BATH
LOOK AT THIS RAY OF LIGHT WHICH ENTERS BY MY WINDOW SAID THE ABBE AND THEN OBSERVE THE LINES TRACED ON THE WALL WELL BY MEANS OF THESE LINES WHICH ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOUBLE MOTION OF THE EARTH AND THE ELLIPSE IT DESCRIBES ROUND THE SUN
I ONCE THOUGHT CONTINUED FARIA OF REMOVING THESE IRON BARS AND LETTING MYSELF DOWN FROM THE WINDOW WHICH AS YOU SEE IS SOMEWHAT WIDER THAN YOURS ALTHOUGH I SHOULD HAVE ENLARGED IT STILL MORE PREPARATORY TO MY FLIGHT
AND MATCHES I PRETENDED THAT I HAD A DISORDER OF THE SKIN AND ASKED FOR A LITTLE SULPHUR WHICH WAS READILY SUPPLIED DANTES LAID THE DIFFERENT THINGS HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT ON THE TABLE AND STOOD WITH HIS HEAD DROOPING ON HIS BREAST
AND WERE AT THAT MOMENT DEEP IN CONSULTATION ABOUT HER SHE DREW BACK TRYING TO BEG THEIR PARDON BUT WAS WITH GENTLE VIOLENCE FORCED TO RETURN AND THE OTHERS WITHDREW
I AM ASHAMED TO THINK HOW LONG I BORE WITH IT BUT IF EVER MAN HAD REASON TO BELIEVE HIMSELF LOVED I WAS THAT MAN I CANNOT UNDERSTAND EVEN NOW
THOUGH GOD KNOWS WITH LITTLE INCLINATION FOR WRITING I THINK IT MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS AT AN END BETWEEN MISS THORPE AND ME I LEFT HER AND BATH YESTERDAY NEVER TO SEE EITHER AGAIN
AND YOU ARE WELL AWARE THAT FROM THE COLLISION OF CLOUDS ELECTRICITY IS PRODUCED FROM ELECTRICITY LIGHTNING FROM LIGHTNING ILLUMINATION NO REPLIED DANTES I KNOW NOTHING
UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF EVEN IN HENRY AND ELEANOR TILNEY SOME SLIGHT IMPERFECTION MIGHT HEREAFTER APPEAR
I DO NOT THINK I SHALL EVER WISH FOR A LETTER AGAIN I AM SORRY SAID HENRY CLOSING THE BOOK HE HAD JUST OPENED IF I HAD SUSPECTED THE LETTER OF CONTAINING ANYTHING UNWELCOME I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS
THEN IN HER LAP AND THEN IN HER POCKET AND SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE KNEW NOT WHAT SHE DID THE GENERAL BETWEEN HIS COCOA AND HIS NEWSPAPER HAD LUCKILY NO LEISURE FOR NOTICING HER BUT TO THE OTHER TWO HER DISTRESS WAS EQUALLY VISIBLE
THAT A PERSON SO INTELLIGENT INGENIOUS AND CLEAR SIGHTED AS THE ABBE MIGHT PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE DARK MYSTERY OF HIS OWN MISFORTUNES WHERE HE HIMSELF COULD SEE NOTHING
I SEPARATED THE FAT FROM THE MEAT SERVED TO ME MELTED IT AND SO MADE OIL HERE IS MY LAMP SO SAYING THE ABBE EXHIBITED A SORT OF TORCH VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN PUBLIC ILLUMINATIONS
WILL YOU TAKE THE TROUBLE OF READING TO US THE PASSAGES WHICH CONCERN MY BROTHER NO READ IT YOURSELF CRIED CATHERINE WHOSE SECOND THOUGHTS WERE CLEARER I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING OF BLUSHING AGAIN THAT SHE HAD BLUSHED BEFORE
FREDERICK WILL NOT BE THE FIRST MAN WHO HAS CHOSEN A WIFE WITH LESS SENSE THAN HIS FAMILY EXPECTED I DO NOT ENVY HIS SITUATION EITHER AS A LOVER OR A SON MISS TILNEY
THE ANXIETIES OF COMMON LIFE BEGAN SOON TO SUCCEED TO THE ALARMS OF ROMANCE HER DESIRE OF HEARING FROM ISABELLA GREW EVERY DAY GREATER SHE WAS QUITE IMPATIENT TO KNOW HOW THE BATH WORLD WENT ON AND HOW THE ROOMS WERE ATTENDED
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE ABBE'S CHAMBER AFTER HAVING PASSED WITH TOLERABLE EASE THROUGH THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE WHICH HOWEVER DID NOT ADMIT OF THEIR HOLDING THEMSELVES ERECT THE TWO FRIENDS REACHED THE FURTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR
THAN THAT IT HAD BEEN ALL A VOLUNTARY SELF CREATED DELUSION EACH TRIFLING CIRCUMSTANCE RECEIVING IMPORTANCE FROM AN IMAGINATION RESOLVED ON ALARM AND EVERYTHING FORCED TO BEND TO ONE PURPOSE BY A MIND WHICH
BUT PERHAPS OBSERVED CATHERINE THOUGH SHE HAS BEHAVED SO ILL BY OUR FAMILY SHE MAY BEHAVE BETTER BY YOURS NOW SHE HAS REALLY GOT THE MAN SHE LIKES SHE MAY BE CONSTANT
BUT WHICH CONSISTED ONLY OF THE ACCOUNT OF A VOYAGE TO INDIA AND TWO OR THREE VOYAGES TO THE LEVANT UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE RECITAL OF HIS LAST CRUISE WITH THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN LECLERE AND THE RECEIPT OF A PACKET TO BE DELIVERED BY HIMSELF TO THE GRAND MARSHAL
AND DIVIDED AT THE NIB LIKE AN ORDINARY PEN DANTES EXAMINED IT WITH INTENSE ADMIRATION THEN LOOKED AROUND TO SEE THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH IT HAD BEEN SHAPED SO CORRECTLY INTO FORM AH YES SAID FARIA THE PENKNIFE
AND UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE NEED NOT FEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME ACTUAL SPECKS IN THE CHARACTER OF THEIR FATHER WHO THOUGH CLEARED FROM THE GROSSLY INJURIOUS SUSPICIONS WHICH SHE MUST EVER BLUSH TO HAVE ENTERTAINED SHE DID BELIEVE
LAID ONE OVER THE OTHER LIKE FOLDS OF PAPYRUS THESE ROLLS CONSISTED OF SLIPS OF CLOTH ABOUT FOUR INCHES WIDE AND EIGHTEEN LONG THEY WERE ALL CAREFULLY NUMBERED AND CLOSELY COVERED WITH WRITING SO LEGIBLE THAT DANTES COULD EASILY READ IT
AND ESPECIALLY WAS SHE ANXIOUS TO BE ASSURED OF ISABELLA'S HAVING MATCHED SOME FINE NETTING COTTON ON WHICH SHE HAD LEFT HER INTENT AND OF HER CONTINUING ON THE BEST TERMS WITH JAMES
CHARMING AS WERE ALL MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S WORKS AND CHARMING EVEN AS WERE THE WORKS OF ALL HER IMITATORS IT WAS NOT IN THEM PERHAPS THAT HUMAN NATURE AT LEAST IN THE MIDLAND COUNTIES OF ENGLAND WAS TO BE LOOKED FOR
WHAT WAS HER FATHER A LAWYER I BELIEVE THEY LIVE AT PUTNEY ARE THEY A WEALTHY FAMILY NO NOT VERY I DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA HAS ANY FORTUNE AT ALL BUT THAT WILL NOT SIGNIFY IN YOUR FAMILY
UPON THE ENORMOUS DEGREE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ABILITY YOU MUST HAVE EMPLOYED TO REACH THE HIGH PERFECTION TO WHICH YOU HAVE ATTAINED WHAT WOULD YOU NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IF YOU HAD BEEN FREE POSSIBLY NOTHING AT ALL THE OVERFLOW OF MY BRAIN WOULD PROBABLY
YOU LOSE HALF YOURSELF YOU FEEL A VOID IN YOUR HEART WHICH NOTHING ELSE CAN OCCUPY SOCIETY IS BECOMING IRKSOME AND AS FOR THE AMUSEMENTS IN WHICH YOU WERE WONT TO SHARE AT BATH THE VERY IDEA OF THEM WITHOUT HER IS ABHORRENT
SAID THE ABBE WE HAVE SOME HOURS BEFORE US IT IS NOW JUST A QUARTER PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK INSTINCTIVELY DANTES TURNED ROUND TO OBSERVE BY WHAT WATCH OR CLOCK THE ABBE HAD BEEN ABLE SO ACCURATELY TO SPECIFY THE HOUR
INTO WHICH THE ABBE'S CELL OPENED FROM THAT POINT THE PASSAGE BECAME MUCH NARROWER AND BARELY PERMITTED ONE TO CREEP THROUGH ON HANDS AND KNEES THE FLOOR OF THE ABBE'S CELL WAS PAVED AND IT HAD BEEN BY RAISING ONE OF THE STONES IN THE MOST OBSCURE CORNER
INDEED I AM AFRAID SHE WILL REPLIED HENRY I AM AFRAID SHE WILL BE VERY CONSTANT UNLESS A BARONET SHOULD COME IN HER WAY THAT IS FREDERICK'S ONLY CHANCE I WILL GET THE BATH PAPER AND LOOK OVER THE ARRIVALS
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF ASKED THE ABBE SMILINGLY IMPUTING THE DEEP ABSTRACTION IN WHICH HIS VISITOR WAS PLUNGED TO THE EXCESS OF HIS AWE AND WONDER I WAS REFLECTING IN THE FIRST PLACE REPLIED DANTES
HIS INTERVIEW WITH THAT PERSONAGE AND HIS RECEIVING IN PLACE OF THE PACKET BROUGHT A LETTER ADDRESSED TO A MONSIEUR NOIRTIER HIS ARRIVAL AT MARSEILLES AND INTERVIEW WITH HIS FATHER HIS AFFECTION FOR MERCEDES AND THEIR NUPTUAL FEAST
I SUPPOSE HE WILL HARDLY EVER RECOVER IT YOUR BROTHER IS CERTAINLY VERY MUCH TO BE PITIED AT PRESENT BUT WE MUST NOT IN OUR CONCERN FOR HIS SUFFERINGS UNDERVALUE YOURS YOU FEEL I SUPPOSE THAT IN LOSING ISABELLA
MOST BITTERLY DID SHE CRY IT WAS NOT ONLY WITH HERSELF THAT SHE WAS SUNK BUT WITH HENRY HER FOLLY WHICH NOW SEEMED EVEN CRIMINAL WAS ALL EXPOSED TO HIM AND HE MUST DESPISE HER FOREVER
INCONCEIVABLE HENRY FREDERICK TOO WHO ALWAYS WORE HIS HEART SO PROUDLY
AT CATHERINE'S INVITATION NOW READ THE LETTER LIKEWISE AND HAVING EXPRESSED ALSO HER CONCERN AND SURPRISE BEGAN TO INQUIRE INTO MISS THORPE'S CONNECTIONS AND FORTUNE HER MOTHER IS A VERY GOOD SORT OF WOMAN WAS CATHERINE'S ANSWER
THE ELDEST YOUNG LADY OBSERVED ALOUD TO THE REST HOW EXCESSIVELY LIKE HER BROTHER MISS MORLAND IS
AND ANSWERED WITH ALL THE PRETTY EXPRESSIONS SHE COULD COMMAND AND AS THE FIRST PROOF OF AMITY SHE WAS SOON INVITED TO ACCEPT AN ARM OF THE ELDEST MISS THORPE AND TAKE A TURN WITH HER ABOUT THE ROOM CATHERINE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS EXTENSION OF HER BATH ACQUAINTANCE
SOON AFTER THEIR REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THE SET CATHERINE PERCEIVED HERSELF TO BE EARNESTLY REGARDED BY A GENTLEMAN WHO STOOD AMONG THE LOOKERS ON IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HER PARTNER
WHERE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF EVENTS AND CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE MISTER ALLEN AFTER DRINKING HIS GLASS OF WATER JOINED SOME GENTLEMEN TO TALK OVER THE POLITICS OF THE DAY AND COMPARE THE ACCOUNTS OF THEIR NEWSPAPERS
IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU BUT IS NOT YOUR NAME ALLEN THIS QUESTION ANSWERED AS IT READILY WAS THE STRANGER PRONOUNCED HERS TO BE THORPE
CATHERINE HAD NEITHER TIME NOR INCLINATION TO ANSWER THE OTHERS WALKED AWAY JOHN THORPE WAS STILL IN VIEW AND SHE GAVE HERSELF UP FOR LOST THAT SHE MIGHT NOT APPEAR HOWEVER TO OBSERVE OR EXPECT HIM
THE AGREEABLENESS THE COMPLIANCE ARE EXPECTED FROM HIM WHILE SHE FURNISHES THE FAN AND THE LAVENDER WATER THAT I SUPPOSE WAS THE DIFFERENCE OF DUTIES WHICH STRUCK YOU AS RENDERING THE CONDITIONS INCAPABLE OF COMPARISON
HOW LITTLE THEY HAD THOUGHT OF MEETING IN BATH AND WHAT A PLEASURE IT WAS TO SEE AN OLD FRIEND THEY PROCEEDED TO MAKE INQUIRIES AND GIVE INTELLIGENCE AS TO THEIR FAMILIES SISTERS AND COUSINS TALKING BOTH TOGETHER
AFTER PARADING THE ROOM TILL THEY WERE TIRED AND HOW PLEASANT IT WOULD BE IF WE HAD ANY ACQUAINTANCE HERE
ALL HAVE BEEN OR AT LEAST ALL HAVE BELIEVED THEMSELVES TO BE IN DANGER FROM THE PURSUIT OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY WISHED TO AVOID AND ALL HAVE BEEN ANXIOUS FOR THE ATTENTIONS OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY
FAR MORE READY TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE INFORMATION AND EACH HEARING VERY LITTLE OF WHAT THE OTHER SAID MISSUS THORPE HOWEVER HAD ONE GREAT ADVANTAGE AS A TALKER OVER MISSUS ALLEN IN A FAMILY OF CHILDREN
WAS REPEATED BY THEM ALL TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER FOR A MOMENT CATHERINE WAS SURPRISED BUT MISSUS THORPE AND HER DAUGHTERS HAD SCARCELY BEGUN THE HISTORY OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER JAMES MORLAND
THE TALLEST IS ISABELLA MY ELDEST IS NOT SHE A FINE YOUNG WOMAN THE OTHERS ARE VERY MUCH ADMIRED TOO BUT I BELIEVE ISABELLA IS THE HANDSOMEST
WHAT IS COSTLY OR NEW IN THEIR ATTIRE HOW LITTLE IT IS BIASED BY THE TEXTURE OF THEIR MUSLIN AND HOW UNSUSCEPTIBLE OF PECULIAR TENDERNESS TOWARDS THE SPOTTED
BEFORE A LADY OF ABOUT HER OWN AGE WHO WAS SITTING BY HER AND HAD BEEN LOOKING AT HER ATTENTIVELY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES ADDRESSED HER WITH GREAT COMPLAISANCE IN THESE WORDS
AND THE LADIES WALKED ABOUT TOGETHER NOTICING EVERY NEW FACE AND ALMOST EVERY NEW BONNET IN THE ROOM THE FEMALE PART OF THE THORPE FAMILY ATTENDED BY JAMES MORLAND APPEARED AMONG THE CROWD IN LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
AND CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY TOOK HER USUAL PLACE BY THE SIDE OF HER FRIEND JAMES WHO WAS NOW IN CONSTANT ATTENDANCE MAINTAINED A SIMILAR POSITION AND SEPARATING THEMSELVES FROM THE REST OF THEIR PARTY THEY WALKED IN THAT MANNER FOR SOME TIME
WISHED TO PLEASE AS SOON AS THEY WERE JOINED BY THE THORPES CATHERINE'S AGONY BEGAN SHE FIDGETED ABOUT IF JOHN THORPE CAME TOWARDS HER HID HERSELF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FROM HIS VIEW AND WHEN HE SPOKE TO HER PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR HIM
TO ESCAPE AND AS SHE BELIEVED SO NARROWLY ESCAPE JOHN THORPE AND TO BE ASKED SO IMMEDIATELY ON HIS JOINING HER ASKED BY MISTER TILNEY AS IF HE HAD SOUGHT HER ON PURPOSE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HER THAT LIFE COULD SUPPLY ANY GREATER FELICITY
OR SOME NONSENSE OF THAT KIND WHICH WOULD HAVE DISTRESSED ME BEYOND CONCEPTION
THE NEXT MORNING CATHERINE THEN RAN DIRECTLY UPSTAIRS AND WATCHED MISS THORPE'S PROGRESS DOWN THE STREET FROM THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOW ADMIRED THE GRACEFUL SPIRIT OF HER WALK THE FASHIONABLE AIR OF HER
REALLY OUR OPINIONS WERE SO EXACTLY THE SAME IT WAS QUITE RIDICULOUS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE POINT IN WHICH WE DIFFERED I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU BY FOR THE WORLD YOU ARE SUCH A SLY THING I AM SURE YOU WOULD HAVE MADE SOME DROLL REMARK OR OTHER ABOUT IT
HE NEVER COMES TO THE PUMP ROOM I SUPPOSE YES SOMETIMES BUT HE HAS RID OUT THIS MORNING WITH MY FATHER MISSUS HUGHES NOW JOINED THEM AND ASKED MISS TILNEY IF SHE WAS READY TO GO
TILNEY HE REPEATED HUM I DO NOT KNOW HIM A GOOD FIGURE OF A MAN WELL PUT TOGETHER
ONE DAY IN THE COUNTRY IS EXACTLY LIKE ANOTHER BUT THEN YOU SPEND YOUR TIME SO MUCH MORE RATIONALLY IN THE COUNTRY DO I DO YOU NOT I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS MUCH DIFFERENCE HERE YOU ARE IN PURSUIT ONLY OF AMUSEMENT ALL DAY LONG
ATTENTION TO HIS WORDS AND PERFECT RELIANCE ON THEIR TRUTH WITH REAL INTEREST AND STRONG ADMIRATION DID HER EYE NOW FOLLOW THE GENERAL AS HE MOVED THROUGH THE CROWD AND HOW HANDSOME A FAMILY THEY ARE WAS HER SECRET REMARK
WAS NOT THE YOUNG LADY HE DANCED WITH ON MONDAY A MISS SMITH YES AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS HUGHES I DARE SAY SHE WAS VERY GLAD TO DANCE DO YOU THINK HER PRETTY NOT VERY
YOUR BROTHER AND I WERE AGREEING THIS MORNING THAT THOUGH IT IS VASTLY WELL TO BE HERE FOR A FEW WEEKS WE WOULD NOT LIVE HERE FOR MILLIONS WE SOON FOUND OUT THAT OUR TASTES WERE EXACTLY ALIKE IN PREFERRING THE COUNTRY TO EVERY OTHER PLACE
HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT VERY ODD TO HEAR ME SAY I WAS ENGAGED THE OTHER EVENING WHEN HE SAW ME SITTING DOWN BUT I REALLY HAD BEEN ENGAGED THE WHOLE DAY TO MISTER THORPE MISS TILNEY COULD ONLY BOW
AND WAS NOW CHIEFLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID HIS SIGHT LEST HE SHOULD ENGAGE HER AGAIN FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT DARED NOT EXPECT THAT MISTER TILNEY SHOULD ASK HER A THIRD TIME TO DANCE
THAT YOU THINK THEY CANNOT BE COMPARED TOGETHER TO BE SURE NOT PEOPLE THAT MARRY CAN NEVER PART BUT MUST GO AND KEEP HOUSE TOGETHER PEOPLE THAT DANCE ONLY STAND OPPOSITE EACH OTHER IN A LONG ROOM FOR HALF AN HOUR
YOU WILL ALLOW ALL THIS YES TO BE SURE AS YOU STATE IT ALL THIS SOUNDS VERY WELL BUT STILL THEY ARE SO VERY DIFFERENT I CANNOT LOOK UPON THEM AT ALL IN THE SAME LIGHT NOR THINK THE SAME DUTIES BELONG TO THEM IN ONE RESPECT THERE CERTAINLY IS A DIFFERENCE
I DO LIKE IT SO VERY MUCH IF I COULD BUT HAVE PAPA AND MAMMA AND THE REST OF THEM HERE I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE TOO HAPPY JAMES'S COMING MY ELDEST BROTHER IS QUITE DELIGHTFUL
AND YET SHE LAY AWAKE TEN MINUTES ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT DEBATING BETWEEN HER SPOTTED AND HER TAMBOURED MUSLIN AND NOTHING BUT THE SHORTNESS OF THE TIME PREVENTED HER BUYING A NEW ONE FOR THE EVENING THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT
AND WHOM SHE INSTANTLY JOINED WITH A FIRMER DETERMINATION TO BE ACQUAINTED THAN SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD COURAGE TO COMMAND HAD SHE NOT BEEN URGED BY THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE DAY BEFORE MISS TILNEY MET HER WITH GREAT CIVILITY
BUT I NEED NOT ASK YOU FOR YOU LOOK DELIGHTFULLY YOU REALLY HAVE DONE YOUR HAIR IN A MORE HEAVENLY STYLE THAN EVER
TWELVE O'CLOCK WAS HER PARTING SPEECH TO HER NEW FRIEND OF HER OTHER HER OLDER HER MORE ESTABLISHED FRIEND ISABELLA OF WHOSE FIDELITY AND WORTH SHE HAD ENJOYED A FORTNIGHT'S EXPERIENCE SHE SCARCELY SAW ANYTHING DURING THE EVENING
SPOKE OF THEM IN TERMS WHICH MADE HER ALL EAGERNESS TO KNOW THEM TOO AND ON HER OPENLY FEARING THAT SHE MIGHT FIND NOBODY TO GO WITH HER IT WAS PROPOSED BY THE BROTHER AND SISTER THAT THEY SHOULD JOIN IN A WALK SOME MORNING OR OTHER I SHALL LIKE IT SHE CRIED
AND ALMOST FORGOT MISTER TILNEY WHILE SHE TALKED TO MISS THORPE FRIENDSHIP IS CERTAINLY THE FINEST BALM FOR THE PANGS OF DISAPPOINTED LOVE THEIR CONVERSATION TURNED UPON THOSE SUBJECTS OF WHICH THE FREE DISCUSSION HAS GENERALLY MUCH TO DO IN PERFECTING A SUDDEN INTIMACY BETWEEN TWO YOUNG LADIES
SHE ENTERED THE ROOMS ON THURSDAY EVENING WITH FEELINGS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HAD ATTENDED HER THITHER THE MONDAY BEFORE
WHICH I CAN KNOW NOTHING OF THERE YOU ARE NOT FOND OF THE COUNTRY YES I AM I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED THERE AND ALWAYS BEEN VERY HAPPY
HERE COME MY DEAR GIRLS CRIED MISSUS THORPE POINTING AT THREE SMART LOOKING FEMALES WHO ARM IN ARM WERE THEN MOVING TOWARDS HER
AND SO I AM AT HOME ONLY I DO NOT FIND SO MUCH OF IT I WALK ABOUT HERE AND SO I DO THERE BUT HERE I SEE A VARIETY OF PEOPLE IN EVERY STREET AND THERE I CAN ONLY GO AND CALL ON MISSUS ALLEN
THIS WAS THE LAST SENTENCE BY WHICH HE COULD WEARY CATHERINE'S ATTENTION FOR HE WAS JUST THEN BORNE OFF BY THE RESISTLESS PRESSURE OF A LONG STRING OF PASSING LADIES HER PARTNER NOW DREW NEAR AND SAID
WITH MORE THAN USUAL EAGERNESS DID CATHERINE HASTEN TO THE PUMP ROOM THE NEXT DAY SECURE WITHIN HERSELF OF SEEING MISTER TILNEY THERE BEFORE THE MORNING WERE OVER AND READY TO MEET HIM WITH A SMILE BUT NO SMILE WAS DEMANDED
OF A COMMANDING ASPECT PAST THE BLOOM BUT NOT PAST THE VIGOUR OF LIFE AND WITH HIS EYE STILL DIRECTED TOWARDS HER SHE SAW HIM PRESENTLY ADDRESS MISTER TILNEY IN A FAMILIAR WHISPER
HE CAME ONLY TO ENGAGE LODGINGS FOR US
MISTER TILNEY WAS VERY MUCH AMUSED ONLY GO AND CALL ON MISSUS ALLEN HE REPEATED WHAT A PICTURE OF INTELLECTUAL POVERTY HOWEVER WHEN YOU SINK INTO THIS ABYSS AGAIN YOU WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY
AM I NEVER TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH HIM HOW DO YOU LIKE MY GOWN I THINK IT DOES NOT LOOK AMISS THE SLEEVES WERE ENTIRELY MY OWN THOUGHT DO YOU KNOW I GET SO IMMODERATELY SICK OF BATH
NO INDEED I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEN I AM QUITE AT A LOSS ONE THING HOWEVER I MUST OBSERVE THIS DISPOSITION ON YOUR SIDE IS RATHER ALARMING
SHE COULD COMPARE THE BALLS OF BATH WITH THOSE OF TUNBRIDGE ITS FASHIONS WITH THE FASHIONS OF LONDON COULD RECTIFY THE OPINIONS OF HER NEW FRIEND IN MANY ARTICLES OF TASTEFUL ATTIRE COULD DISCOVER A FLIRTATION BETWEEN ANY GENTLEMAN AND LADY WHO
AND POINT OUT A QUIZ THROUGH THE THICKNESS OF A CROWD THESE POWERS RECEIVED DUE ADMIRATION FROM CATHERINE TO WHOM THEY WERE ENTIRELY NEW AND THE RESPECT WHICH THEY NATURALLY INSPIRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO GREAT FOR FAMILIARITY
WELL OTHER PEOPLE MUST JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THOSE WHO GO TO LONDON MAY THINK NOTHING OF BATH BUT I WHO LIVE IN A SMALL RETIRED VILLAGE IN THE COUNTRY CAN NEVER FIND GREATER SAMENESS IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAN IN MY OWN HOME
SHE CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED IN IT DRESS IS AT ALL TIMES A FRIVOLOUS DISTINCTION AND EXCESSIVE SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT OFTEN DESTROYS ITS OWN AIM CATHERINE KNEW ALL THIS VERY WELL HER GREAT AUNT HAD READ HER A LECTURE ON THE SUBJECT ONLY THE CHRISTMAS BEFORE
I SEE THAT YOU GUESS WHAT I HAVE JUST BEEN ASKED THAT GENTLEMAN KNOWS YOUR NAME AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW HIS IT IS GENERAL TILNEY MY FATHER CATHERINE'S ANSWER WAS ONLY OH BUT IT WAS AN OH EXPRESSING EVERYTHING NEEDFUL
WHAT WOULD NOT I GIVE TO SEE HIM I REALLY AM QUITE WILD WITH IMPATIENCE MY MOTHER SAYS HE IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD SHE SAW HIM THIS MORNING YOU KNOW YOU MUST INTRODUCE HIM TO ME
I ASSURE YOU MY BROTHER IS QUITE IN LOVE WITH YOU ALREADY AND AS FOR MISTER TILNEY BUT THAT IS A SETTLED THING EVEN YOUR MODESTY CANNOT DOUBT HIS ATTACHMENT NOW HIS COMING BACK TO BATH MAKES IT TOO PLAIN OH
EDWARD AT MERCHANT TAYLORS AND WILLIAM AT SEA AND ALL OF THEM MORE BELOVED AND RESPECTED IN THEIR DIFFERENT STATION THAN ANY OTHER THREE BEINGS EVER WERE
HOW WELL YOUR BROTHER DANCES WAS AN ARTLESS EXCLAMATION OF CATHERINE'S TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THEIR CONVERSATION WHICH AT ONCE SURPRISED AND AMUSED HER COMPANION HENRY SHE REPLIED WITH A SMILE YES HE DOES DANCE VERY WELL
THIS SENTIMENT HAD BEEN UTTERED SO OFTEN IN VAIN THAT MISSUS ALLEN HAD NO PARTICULAR REASON TO HOPE IT WOULD BE FOLLOWED WITH MORE ADVANTAGE NOW BUT WE ARE TOLD TO DESPAIR OF NOTHING WE WOULD ATTAIN AS UNWEARIED
HER WISHES HOPES AND PLANS ALL CENTRED IN NOTHING LESS EVERY YOUNG LADY MAY FEEL FOR MY HEROINE IN THIS CRITICAL MOMENT FOR EVERY YOUNG LADY HAS AT SOME TIME OR OTHER KNOWN THE SAME AGITATION
DILIGENCE OUR POINT WOULD GAIN AND THE UNWEARIED DILIGENCE WITH WHICH SHE HAD EVERY DAY WISHED FOR THE SAME THING WAS AT LENGTH TO HAVE ITS JUST REWARD FOR HARDLY HAD SHE BEEN SEATED TEN MINUTES
THIS BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE FAMILY IS INTENDED TO SUPERSEDE THE NECESSITY OF A LONG AND MINUTE DETAIL FROM MISSUS THORPE HERSELF OF HER PAST ADVENTURES AND SUFFERINGS
NO INDEED I SHOULD NOT OH YES YOU WOULD INDEED I KNOW YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
DOOR OF MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE AND THAT THEY SHOULD THERE PART WITH A MOST AFFECTIONATE AND LENGTHENED SHAKE OF HANDS AFTER LEARNING TO THEIR MUTUAL RELIEF THAT THEY SHOULD SEE EACH OTHER ACROSS THE THEATRE AT NIGHT AND SAY THEIR PRAYERS IN THE SAME CHAPEL
TILL CATHERINE BEGAN TO DOUBT THE HAPPINESS OF A SITUATION WHICH CONFINING HER ENTIRELY TO HER FRIEND AND BROTHER GAVE HER VERY LITTLE SHARE IN THE NOTICE OF EITHER THEY WERE ALWAYS ENGAGED IN SOME SENTIMENTAL DISCUSSION OR LIVELY DISPUTE
UP THE STEPS AND DOWN PEOPLE WHOM NOBODY CARED ABOUT AND NOBODY WANTED TO SEE AND HE ONLY WAS ABSENT WHAT A DELIGHTFUL PLACE BATH IS SAID MISSUS ALLEN AS THEY SAT DOWN NEAR THE GREAT CLOCK
FIDELITY AND COMPLAISANCE ARE THE PRINCIPAL DUTIES OF BOTH AND THOSE MEN WHO DO NOT CHOOSE TO DANCE OR MARRY THEMSELVES HAVE NO BUSINESS WITH THE PARTNERS OR WIVES OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THEY ARE SUCH VERY DIFFERENT THINGS
IN CHATTING WITH MISS TILNEY BEFORE THE EVENING CONCLUDED A NEW SOURCE OF FELICITY AROSE TO HER SHE HAD NEVER TAKEN A COUNTRY WALK SINCE HER ARRIVAL IN BATH MISS TILNEY TO WHOM ALL THE COMMONLY FREQUENTED ENVIRONS WERE FAMILIAR
THAT IN BOTH IT IS AN ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN FORMED FOR THE ADVANTAGE OF EACH AND THAT WHEN ONCE ENTERED INTO THEY BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO EACH OTHER TILL THE MOMENT OF ITS DISSOLUTION THAT IT IS THEIR DUTY
OH YES I SHALL NEVER BE IN WANT OF SOMETHING TO TALK OF AGAIN TO MISSUS ALLEN OR ANYBODY ELSE I REALLY BELIEVE I SHALL ALWAYS BE TALKING OF BATH WHEN I AM AT HOME AGAIN
RETURNED HER ADVANCES WITH EQUAL GOODWILL AND THEY CONTINUED TALKING TOGETHER AS LONG AS BOTH PARTIES REMAINED IN THE ROOM AND THOUGH IN ALL PROBABILITY NOT AN OBSERVATION WAS MADE
AND ESPECIALLY AS IT TURNS OUT THAT THE VERY FAMILY WE ARE JUST GOT SO INTIMATE WITH ARE HIS INTIMATE FRIENDS ALREADY OH WHO CAN EVER BE TIRED OF BATH NOT THOSE WHO BRING SUCH FRESH FEELINGS OF EVERY SORT TO IT AS YOU DO
BEFORE SHE REMEMBERED THAT HER ELDEST BROTHER HAD LATELY FORMED AN INTIMACY WITH A YOUNG MAN OF HIS OWN COLLEGE OF THE NAME OF THORPE
SHE KEPT HER EYES INTENTLY FIXED ON HER FAN AND A SELF CONDEMNATION FOR HER FOLLY IN SUPPOSING THAT AMONG SUCH A CROWD THEY SHOULD EVEN MEET WITH THE TILNEYS IN ANY REASONABLE TIME HAD JUST PASSED THROUGH HER MIND WHEN SHE SUDDENLY FOUND HERSELF ADDRESSED
SUCH AS DRESS BALLS FLIRTATIONS AND QUIZZES MISS THORPE HOWEVER BEING FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN MISS MORLAND AND AT LEAST FOUR YEARS BETTER INFORMED
NOR AN EXPRESSION USED BY EITHER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MADE AND USED SOME THOUSANDS OF TIMES BEFORE UNDER THAT ROOF IN EVERY BATH SEASON
GREAT THOUGH NOT UNCOMMON FROM WHICH ONE OF THE OTHER SEX RATHER THAN HER OWN A BROTHER RATHER THAN A GREAT AUNT MIGHT HAVE WARNED HER
AND MISSUS ALLEN IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE FEATURES OF A FORMER SCHOOLFELLOW AND INTIMATE WHOM SHE HAD SEEN ONLY ONCE SINCE THEIR RESPECTIVE MARRIAGES AND THAT MANY YEARS AGO THEIR JOY ON THIS MEETING WAS VERY GREAT
FIGURE AND DRESS AND FELT GRATEFUL AS WELL SHE MIGHT FOR THE CHANCE WHICH HAD PROCURED HER SUCH A FRIEND MISSUS THORPE WAS A WIDOW AND NOT A VERY RICH ONE SHE WAS A GOOD HUMOURED WELL MEANING WOMAN
NEATNESS AND FASHION ARE ENOUGH FOR THE FORMER AND A SOMETHING OF SHABBINESS OR IMPROPRIETY WILL BE MOST ENDEARING TO THE LATTER BUT NOT ONE OF THESE GRAVE REFLECTIONS TROUBLED THE TRANQUILLITY OF CATHERINE
A FAMOUS CLEVER ANIMAL FOR THE ROAD ONLY FORTY GUINEAS I HAD FIFTY MINDS TO BUY IT MYSELF
FOR IF I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TALK TO THEM AND BESIDES I DO NOT WANT TO TALK TO ANYBODY NOW YOU HAVE GIVEN ME A SECURITY WORTH HAVING AND I SHALL PROCEED WITH COURAGE
I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD BE TIRED IF I WERE TO STAY HERE SIX MONTHS BATH COMPARED WITH LONDON HAS LITTLE VARIETY AND SO EVERYBODY FINDS OUT EVERY YEAR FOR SIX WEEKS I ALLOW BATH IS PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT BEYOND THAT IT IS THE MOST TIRESOME PLACE IN THE WORLD
THE COTILLIONS WERE OVER THE COUNTRY DANCING BEGINNING AND SHE SAW NOTHING OF THE TILNEYS DO NOT BE FRIGHTENED MY DEAR CATHERINE WHISPERED ISABELLA BUT I AM REALLY GOING TO DANCE WITH YOUR BROTHER AGAIN
AND THE HONEST RELISH OF BALLS AND PLAYS AND EVERYDAY SIGHTS IS PAST WITH THEM HERE THEIR CONVERSATION CLOSED THE DEMANDS OF THE DANCE BECOMING NOW TOO IMPORTUNATE FOR A DIVIDED ATTENTION
THE MORNING HAD ANSWERED ALL HER HOPES AND THE EVENING OF THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS NOW THE OBJECT OF EXPECTATION THE FUTURE GOOD WHAT GOWN AND WHAT HEAD DRESS SHE SHOULD WEAR ON THE OCCASION BECAME HER CHIEF CONCERN
THE MISS THORPES WERE INTRODUCED AND MISS MORLAND WHO HAD BEEN FOR A SHORT TIME FORGOTTEN WAS INTRODUCED LIKEWISE THE NAME SEEMED TO STRIKE THEM ALL AND AFTER SPEAKING TO HER WITH GREAT CIVILITY
AND SUCH IS YOUR DEFINITION OF MATRIMONY AND DANCING TAKEN IN THAT LIGHT CERTAINLY THEIR RESEMBLANCE IS NOT STRIKING BUT I THINK I COULD PLACE THEM IN SUCH A VIEW YOU WILL ALLOW THAT IN BOTH MAN HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF CHOICE WOMAN ONLY THE POWER OF REFUSAL
IN MARRIAGE THE MAN IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN TO MAKE THE HOME AGREEABLE TO THE MAN HE IS TO PURVEY AND SHE IS TO SMILE BUT IN DANCING THEIR DUTIES ARE EXACTLY CHANGED
IS HE IN THE HOUSE NOW LOOK ABOUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE I ASSURE YOU I CAN HARDLY EXIST TILL I SEE HIM NO SAID CATHERINE HE IS NOT HERE I CANNOT SEE HIM ANYWHERE OH HORRID
AND TILL THE USUAL MOMENT OF GOING TO THE PUMP ROOM SHE FELT SOME ALARM FROM THE DREAD OF A SECOND PREVENTION BUT NOTHING OF THAT KIND OCCURRED NO VISITORS APPEARED TO DELAY THEM AND THEY ALL THREE SET OFF IN GOOD TIME FOR THE PUMP ROOM
BUT IT WOULD NOT ANSWER MY PURPOSE IT WOULD NOT DO FOR THE FIELD I WOULD GIVE ANY MONEY FOR A REAL GOOD HUNTER I HAVE THREE NOW THE BEST THAT EVER WERE BACKED I WOULD NOT TAKE EIGHT HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR THEM
NEAR LONDON THE WHOLE BEING EXPLAINED MANY OBLIGING THINGS WERE SAID BY THE MISS THORPES OF THEIR WISH OF BEING BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH HER OF BEING CONSIDERED AS ALREADY FRIENDS THROUGH THE FRIENDSHIP OF THEIR BROTHERS ET CETERA WHICH CATHERINE HEARD WITH PLEASURE
AND A VERY INDULGENT MOTHER HER ELDEST DAUGHTER HAD GREAT PERSONAL BEAUTY AND THE YOUNGER ONES BY PRETENDING TO BE AS HANDSOME AS THEIR SISTER IMITATING HER AIR AND DRESSING IN THE SAME STYLE DID VERY WELL
NOW MISTER MORLAND FOR HE WAS CLOSE TO HER ON THE OTHER SIDE I SHALL NOT SPEAK ANOTHER WORD TO YOU ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING SO I CHARGE YOU NOT TO EXPECT IT MY SWEETEST CATHERINE HOW HAVE YOU BEEN THIS LONG AGE
HOW SURPRISED I WAS TO SEE HIM AGAIN I FELT SO SURE OF HIS BEING QUITE GONE AWAY
CONFUSED BY HIS NOTICE AND BLUSHING FROM THE FEAR OF ITS BEING EXCITED BY SOMETHING WRONG IN HER APPEARANCE SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD
I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU BY FOR THE WORLD INDEED YOU DO ME INJUSTICE I WOULD NOT HAVE MADE SO IMPROPER A REMARK UPON ANY ACCOUNT AND BESIDES I AM SURE IT WOULD NEVER HAVE ENTERED MY HEAD
AND DO NOT LET US PUT IT OFF LET US GO TOMORROW THIS WAS READILY AGREED TO WITH ONLY A PROVISO OF MISS TILNEY'S THAT IT DID NOT RAIN WHICH CATHERINE WAS SURE IT WOULD NOT AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THEY WERE TO CALL FOR HER IN PULTENEY STREET AND REMEMBER
EACH TO ENDEAVOUR TO GIVE THE OTHER NO CAUSE FOR WISHING THAT HE OR SHE HAD BESTOWED THEMSELVES ELSEWHERE AND THEIR BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THEIR OWN IMAGINATIONS FROM WANDERING TOWARDS THE PERFECTIONS OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS
SINCE THEY HAD BEEN CONTENTED TO KNOW NOTHING OF EACH OTHER FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS COMPLIMENTS ON GOOD LOOKS NOW PASSED AND AFTER OBSERVING HOW TIME HAD SLIPPED AWAY SINCE THEY WERE LAST TOGETHER
THIS CIVILITY WAS DULY RETURNED AND THEY PARTED ON MISS TILNEY'S SIDE WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE OF HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE'S FEELINGS AND ON CATHERINE'S WITHOUT THE SMALLEST CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING EXPLAINED THEM SHE WENT HOME VERY HAPPY
THEIR INCREASING ATTACHMENT WAS NOT TO BE SATISFIED WITH HALF A DOZEN TURNS IN THE PUMP ROOM BUT REQUIRED WHEN THEY ALL QUITTED IT TOGETHER
IN WHICH THE WORTHLESSNESS OF LORDS AND ATTORNEYS MIGHT BE SET FORTH
I HOPE I SHALL HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU AGAIN SOON SAID CATHERINE SHALL YOU BE AT THE COTILLION BALL TOMORROW PERHAPS WE YES I THINK WE CERTAINLY SHALL I AM GLAD OF IT FOR WE SHALL ALL BE THERE
HAD NOT THE EASY GAIETY OF MISS THORPE'S MANNERS AND HER FREQUENT EXPRESSIONS OF DELIGHT ON THIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER SOFTENED DOWN EVERY FEELING OF AWE AND LEFT NOTHING BUT TENDER AFFECTION
MISSUS ALLEN HAD NO SIMILAR INFORMATION TO GIVE NO SIMILAR TRIUMPHS TO PRESS ON THE UNWILLING AND UNBELIEVING EAR OF HER FRIEND
MISTER THORPE IS SUCH A VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MY BROTHER'S THAT IF HE TALKS TO ME I MUST TALK TO HIM AGAIN BUT THERE ARE HARDLY THREE YOUNG MEN IN THE ROOM BESIDES HIM THAT I HAVE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH AND IS THAT TO BE MY ONLY SECURITY ALAS ALAS
THAT GENTLEMAN WOULD HAVE PUT ME OUT OF PATIENCE HAD HE STAYED WITH YOU HALF A MINUTE LONGER HE HAS NO BUSINESS TO WITHDRAW THE ATTENTION OF MY PARTNER FROM ME WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT OF MUTUAL AGREEABLENESS FOR THE SPACE OF AN EVENING
AT LENGTH HOWEVER SHE WAS EMPOWERED TO DISENGAGE HERSELF FROM HER FRIEND BY THE AVOWED NECESSITY OF SPEAKING TO MISS TILNEY WHOM SHE MOST JOYFULLY SAW JUST ENTERING THE ROOM WITH MISSUS HUGHES
AND WHEN SHE EXPATIATED ON THE TALENTS OF HER SONS AND THE BEAUTY OF HER DAUGHTERS WHEN SHE RELATED THEIR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND VIEWS THAT JOHN WAS AT OXFORD
AND AGAIN SOLICITED TO DANCE BY MISTER TILNEY HIMSELF WITH WHAT SPARKLING EYES AND READY MOTION SHE GRANTED HIS REQUEST AND WITH HOW PLEASING A FLUTTER OF HEART SHE WENT WITH HIM TO THE SET MAY BE EASILY IMAGINED
AND ALL OUR AGREEABLENESS BELONGS SOLELY TO EACH OTHER FOR THAT TIME NOBODY CAN FASTEN THEMSELVES ON THE NOTICE OF ONE WITHOUT INJURING THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER I CONSIDER A COUNTRY DANCE AS AN EMBLEM OF MARRIAGE
WOMAN IS FINE FOR HER OWN SATISFACTION ALONE NO MAN WILL ADMIRE HER THE MORE NO WOMAN WILL LIKE HER THE BETTER FOR IT
DO YOU FIND BATH AS AGREEABLE AS WHEN I HAD THE HONOUR OF MAKING THE INQUIRY BEFORE YES QUITE MORE SO INDEED MORE SO TAKE CARE OR YOU WILL FORGET TO BE TIRED OF IT AT THE PROPER TIME YOU OUGHT TO BE TIRED AT THE END OF SIX WEEKS
I DECLARE POSITIVELY IT IS QUITE SHOCKING I TELL HIM HE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF BUT YOU AND JOHN MUST KEEP US IN COUNTENANCE MAKE HASTE MY DEAR CREATURE AND COME TO US JOHN IS JUST WALKED OFF BUT HE WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT
THERE WAS A STUDY FOR EMMANUEL WHO NEVER STUDIED AND A MUSIC ROOM FOR JULIE WHO NEVER PLAYED THE WHOLE OF THE SECOND STORY WAS SET APART FOR MAXIMILIAN IT WAS PRECISELY SIMILAR TO HIS SISTER'S APARTMENTS EXCEPT THAT FOR THE BREAKFAST PARLOR HE HAD A BILLIARD ROOM
MONTE CRISTO ROSE AND WITHOUT MAKING ANY ANSWER FOR THE TREMULOUSNESS OF HIS VOICE WOULD HAVE BETRAYED HIS EMOTION WALKED UP AND DOWN THE APARTMENT WITH A SLOW STEP OUR MAGNIFICENCE MAKES YOU SMILE COUNT SAID MAXIMILIAN WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM WITH HIS EYES
AND THROUGH THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO CHANGE ANY OF THE CUSTOMS OF THEIR PATERNAL HOUSE TAKING SIX YEARS TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT LESS SCRUPULOUS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE EFFECTED IN TWO OR THREE MARSEILLES RESOUNDED WITH THEIR WELL EARNED PRAISES AT LAST ONE DAY EMMANUEL CAME TO HIS WIFE WHO HAD JUST FINISHED MAKING UP THE ACCOUNTS
AN ENGLISHMAN SAID MONTE CRISTO WHO GREW UNEASY AT THE ATTENTION WITH WHICH JULIE LOOKED AT HIM AN ENGLISHMAN YOU SAY YES REPLIED MAXIMILIAN AN ENGLISHMAN WHO REPRESENTED HIMSELF AS THE CONFIDENTIAL CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH AT ROME
BUT LISTEN TO ME VALENTINE AND I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT I BECAME WEARY OF RANGING FIELDS AND SCALING WALLS AND SERIOUSLY ALARMED AT THE IDEA SUGGESTED BY YOU THAT IF CAUGHT HOVERING ABOUT HERE YOUR FATHER WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE ME SENT TO PRISON AS A THIEF
MADEMOISELLE JULIE SAID HE PENELON HAD STILL PRESERVED THE HABIT OF CALLING HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER MADEMOISELLE JULIE AND HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE THE NAME TO MADAME HERBAULT
BUT HE NEVER HAS ANY REGARD FOR HIS POOR SISTER PENELON PENELON AN OLD MAN WHO WAS DIGGING BUSILY AT ONE OF THE BEDS STUCK HIS SPADE IN THE EARTH AND APPROACHED CAP IN HAND STRIVING TO CONCEAL A QUID OF TOBACCO HE HAD JUST THRUST INTO HIS CHEEK
DEAREST VALENTINE SAID THE YOUNG MAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR RESPECTIVE STATIONS MAKES ME FEAR TO OFFEND YOU BY SPEAKING OF MY LOVE BUT YET I CANNOT FIND MYSELF IN YOUR PRESENCE WITHOUT LONGING TO POUR FORTH MY SOUL AND TELL YOU HOW FONDLY I ADORE YOU
IT WAS THIS THAT MADE ME START WHEN YOU SAID THE OTHER DAY
DON'T DISTURB YOURSELF JULIE SAID HE THE COUNT HAS ONLY BEEN TWO OR THREE DAYS IN PARIS BUT HE ALREADY KNOWS WHAT A FASHIONABLE WOMAN OF THE MARAIS IS AND IF HE DOES NOT YOU WILL SHOW HIM
THE COUNT'S FEATURES DISPLAYED AN EXPRESSION OF THE MOST INTENSE CURIOSITY OH ALL THIS IS A FAMILY HISTORY AS CHATEAU RENAUD TOLD YOU THE OTHER DAY OBSERVED MAXIMILIAN
OR IN OTHER WORDS PROJECTED A STREET AT THE FARTHER SIDE OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN THE STREET WAS LAID OUT A NAME WAS CHOSEN AND POSTED UP ON AN IRON PLATE BUT BEFORE CONSTRUCTION WAS BEGUN
IN WHICH HE OFFERS TO PURCHASE THE GOOD WILL OF THE HOUSE TO UNITE WITH HIS OWN FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ADVISE ME WHAT I HAD BETTER DO
A FRIEND LOST TO HIM FOREVER AND ON HIS DEATH BED WHEN THE NEAR APPROACH OF ETERNITY SEEMED TO HAVE ILLUMINED HIS MIND WITH SUPERNATURAL LIGHT THIS THOUGHT WHICH HAD UNTIL THEN BEEN BUT A DOUBT BECAME A CONVICTION AND HIS LAST WORDS WERE MAXIMILIAN IT WAS EDMOND DANTES
FOR GOD'S SAKE TELL ME DID YOU KNOW THIS ENGLISHMAN BUT YOU TELL ME ALSO THAT THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAVE CONSTANTLY DENIED HAVING RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE YES THEN IS IT NOT PROBABLE THAT THIS ENGLISHMAN MAY BE SOME ONE WHO GRATEFUL FOR A KINDNESS YOUR FATHER HAD SHOWN HIM
FOR HE HAS DONE FOR US WHAT HE GRANTS ONLY TO HIS CHOSEN HE SENT US ONE OF HIS ANGELS
IF LORD WILMORE WAS YOUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR I FEAR YOU WILL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN I PARTED FROM HIM TWO YEARS AGO AT PALERMO AND HE WAS THEN ON THE POINT OF SETTING OUT FOR THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS SO THAT I FEAR HE WILL NEVER RETURN
WITH ITS THICKLY PLANTED COURT YARD OPENING INTO THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE AND TO THE GARDEN SHUT IN BY THIS GATE WHICH FORMERLY COMMUNICATED WITH A FINE KITCHEN GARDEN OF ABOUT AN ACRE FOR THE DEMON OF SPECULATION DREW A LINE
AT LEAST I WAS IN YOUR THOUGHTS YOU ASKED ME THE CAUSE OF MY BEING LATE AND WHY I COME DISGUISED I WILL CANDIDLY EXPLAIN THE REASON OF BOTH
FOR THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY YEARS THAT I HAVE THUS YIELDED TO MY FEELINGS AND HE HASTILY QUITTED THE APARTMENT THIS COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO IS A STRANGE MAN SAID EMMANUEL YES ANSWERED MAXIMILIAN BUT I FEEL SURE HE HAS AN EXCELLENT HEART AND THAT HE LIKES US
BUT THE EYE OF LOVE HAD ALREADY SEEN EVEN THROUGH THE NARROW CHINKS OF THE WOODEN PALISADES THE MOVEMENT OF THE WHITE ROBE AND OBSERVED THE FLUTTERING OF THE BLUE SASH PRESSING HIS LIPS CLOSE TO THE PLANKS HE EXCLAIMED DON'T BE ALARMED VALENTINE IT IS I
IF IT BE BUT TO CARRY AWAY WITH ME THE RECOLLECTION OF SUCH SWEET MOMENTS I COULD EVEN THANK YOU FOR CHIDING ME FOR IT LEAVES ME A GLEAM OF HOPE THAT IF YOU DID NOT EXPECT ME AND THAT INDEED WOULD BE WORSE THAN VANITY TO SUPPOSE
ALL OF THE RICHEST AND GLOSSIEST BLACK ILL ACCORDED WITH HIS PLEBEIAN ATTIRE AFTER CASTING A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM IN ORDER TO ASSURE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS UNOBSERVED HE ENTERED BY THE SMALL GATE AND
I WAS WONDERING WHAT COULD BE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PURSE WITH THE PAPER AT ONE END AND THE LARGE DIAMOND AT THE OTHER COUNT REPLIED MAXIMILIAN WITH AN AIR OF GRAVITY THOSE ARE OUR MOST PRECIOUS FAMILY TREASURES THE STONE SEEMS VERY BRILLIANT ANSWERED THE COUNT
BUT AS HE HAD BUT ONE EYE AND THAT EYE HAD BECOME SOMEWHAT DIM IN THE COURSE OF NINE YEARS
HE HAD RESERVED THE HOUSE AND HALF THE GARDEN AND BUILDING A WALL BETWEEN THE GARDEN AND THE WORKSHOPS HAD LET THEM UPON LEASE WITH THE PAVILIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN
THAT WOULD COMPROMISE THE HONOR OF THE FRENCH ARMY TO SAY NOTHING OF THE FACT THAT THE CONTINUAL PRESENCE OF A CAPTAIN OF SPAHIS IN A PLACE WHERE NO WARLIKE PROJECTS COULD BE SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR IT MIGHT WELL CREATE SURPRISE
IT OCCURRED TO THE POSSESSOR OF THE PROPERTY THAT A HANDSOME SUM MIGHT BE OBTAINED FOR THE GROUND THEN DEVOTED TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BY BUILDING ALONG THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED STREET AND SO MAKING IT A BRANCH OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE ITSELF
MAXIMILIAN HAD SCARCELY FINISHED HIS STORY DURING WHICH THE COUNT'S HEART HAD SWELLED WITHIN HIM WHEN EMMANUEL ENTERED WEARING A HAT AND COAT HE SALUTED THE COUNT WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IS AWARE OF THE RANK OF HIS GUEST THEN AFTER HAVING LED MONTE CRISTO AROUND THE LITTLE GARDEN
ENDEAVORING TO DISCERN SOMETHING ON THE OTHER SIDE BY MEANS OF THE OPENINGS IN THE PLANKS THE EARNESTNESS OF HER ATTITUDE AND THE FIXED GAZE WITH WHICH SHE SEEMED TO SEEK THE OBJECT OF HER WISHES PROVING HOW MUCH HER FEELINGS WERE INTERESTED IN THE MATTER
FROM PRESUMING TO SULLY THE ARISTOCRATIC ENCLOSURE BELONGING TO THE MANSION THE GATE HAD BEEN BOARDED UP TO A HEIGHT OF SIX FEET TRUE THE PLANKS WERE NOT SO CLOSELY ADJUSTED BUT THAT A HASTY PEEP MIGHT BE OBTAINED THROUGH THEIR INTERSTICES
NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO I ONLY GUESSED I KNEW A LORD WILMORE WHO WAS CONSTANTLY DOING ACTIONS OF THIS KIND WITHOUT REVEALING HIMSELF HE WAS AN ECCENTRIC BEING AND DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE EXISTENCE OF GRATITUDE
AND WHERE CABBAGES CARROTS RADISHES PEASE AND MELONS HAD ONCE FLOURISHED A SCANTY CROP OF LUCERNE ALONE BORE EVIDENCE OF ITS BEING DEEMED WORTHY OF CULTIVATION
AND WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD FORGOTTEN HAS TAKEN THIS METHOD OF REQUITING THE OBLIGATION EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE IN THIS AFFAIR EVEN A MIRACLE WHAT WAS HIS NAME ASKED MONTE CRISTO HE GAVE NO OTHER NAME ANSWERED JULIE LOOKING EARNESTLY AT THE COUNT
THE CARRIAGES THAT DROVE UP TO THE DOOR WERE COMPELLED TO TURN TO AVOID A FOUNTAIN THAT PLAYED IN A BASIN OF ROCKWORK AN ORNAMENT THAT HAD EXCITED THE JEALOUSY OF THE WHOLE QUARTER
SAID A FEW HURRIED WORDS TO MADAME HERBAULT AND PRESSING THE HANDS OF EMMANUEL AND MAXIMILIAN MADAME SAID HE I TRUST YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO VISIT YOU OCCASIONALLY I VALUE YOUR FRIENDSHIP AND FEEL GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR WELCOME
OH HEAVEN EXCLAIMED JULIE CLASPING HER HANDS IN WHAT DID HE BELIEVE THEN HE DID NOT CREDIT IT AT THE PERIOD WHICH I KNEW HIM SAID MONTE CRISTO TOUCHED TO THE HEART BY THE ACCENTS OF JULIE'S VOICE BUT PERHAPS SINCE THEN HE HAS HAD PROOFS THAT GRATITUDE DOES EXIST
I KEPT IN THE BACKGROUND AS YOU WISHED AND WAITED NOT FOR THE DECISION OF YOUR HEART OR MY OWN
THE INCESSANT AND MELODIOUS WARBLING OF BIRDS AND THE ENTIRE REMOVAL FROM EITHER THE NOISE OF THE STREET OR THE BUSTLE OF THE MANSION ON THE EVENING OF ONE OF THE WARMEST DAYS SPRING HAD YET BESTOWED ON THE INHABITANTS OF PARIS
HAD LORD WILMORE SEEN WHAT I NOW SEE HE WOULD BECOME ATTACHED TO LIFE FOR THE TEARS YOU SHED WOULD RECONCILE HIM TO MANKIND AND HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO JULIE WHO GAVE HIM HERS CARRIED AWAY BY THE LOOK AND ACCENT OF THE COUNT
HE LABORED AND TOILED UNTIL HE HAD AMASSED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS SIX YEARS SUFFICED TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECT OH I ASSURE YOU SIR IT WAS A TOUCHING SPECTACLE TO SEE THESE YOUNG CREATURES DESTINED BY THEIR TALENTS FOR HIGHER STATIONS TOILING TOGETHER
BUT CONTINUED SHE LORD WILMORE HAD A FAMILY OR FRIENDS HE MUST HAVE KNOWN SOME ONE CAN WE NOT OH IT IS USELESS TO INQUIRE RETURNED THE COUNT PERHAPS AFTER ALL HE WAS NOT THE MAN YOU SEEK FOR
SUCH FELICITY SEEMS ABOVE ALL PRICE AS A THING IMPOSSIBLE AND UNATTAINABLE BUT WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT I PURCHASE ALL THIS DELIGHT JOY AND HAPPINESS
MONTE CRISTO FELT TEARS START INTO HIS EYES AND HE AGAIN WALKED HASTILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN SAID MAXIMILIAN IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF HIM TELL US WHAT IT IS ALAS CRIED MONTE CRISTO STRIVING TO REPRESS HIS EMOTION
SO I HAVE BECOME A GARDENER AND CONSEQUENTLY ADOPTED THE COSTUME OF MY CALLING WHAT EXCESSIVE NONSENSE YOU TALK MAXIMILIAN NONSENSE PRAY DO NOT CALL WHAT I CONSIDER THE WISEST ACTION OF MY LIFE BY SUCH A NAME
INTO THE LARGE STONE VASES THAT STOOD UPON THE TWO SQUARE PILASTERS OF A CURIOUSLY WROUGHT IRON GATE
UNKNOWN YOU SAY IS THE MAN WHO RENDERED YOU THIS SERVICE UNKNOWN TO YOU YES WE HAVE NEVER HAD THE HAPPINESS OF PRESSING HIS HAND CONTINUED MAXIMILIAN WE HAVE SUPPLICATED HEAVEN IN VAIN TO GRANT US THIS FAVOR
AND HAD NOW FALLEN SO COMPLETELY IN GENERAL ESTIMATION AS TO RETURN NOT EVEN THE ONE HALF PER CENT IT HAD ORIGINALLY PAID TOWARDS THE HOUSE THE CHESTNUT TREES WE HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED ROSE HIGH ABOVE THE WALL
WHERE THE WIDE SPREADING CHESTNUT TREES RAISED THEIR HEADS HIGH ABOVE THE WALLS IN A SOLID RAMPART AND WITH THE COMING OF EVERY SPRING SCATTERED A SHOWER OF DELICATE PINK AND WHITE BLOSSOMS
BUT SUCH AS WE ARE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED BITTER SORROWS AND GOD HAS POURED BALM INTO YOUR WOUNDS AS HE DOES INTO THOSE OF ALL WHO ARE IN AFFLICTION SAID MONTE CRISTO INQUIRINGLY YES COUNT RETURNED JULIE WE MAY INDEED SAY HE HAS
CAREFULLY CLOSING AND SECURING IT AFTER HIM PROCEEDED WITH A HURRIED STEP TOWARDS THE BARRIER AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE EXPECTED THOUGH PROBABLY NOT IN SUCH A COSTUME THE YOUNG WOMAN STARTED IN TERROR AND WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A HASTY RETREAT
MONSIEUR RETURNED MAXIMILIAN RAISING THE GLASS COVER AND RESPECTFULLY KISSING THE SILKEN PURSE THIS HAS TOUCHED THE HAND OF A MAN WHO SAVED MY FATHER FROM SUICIDE US FROM RUIN AND OUR NAME FROM SHAME AND DISGRACE A MAN BY WHOSE MATCHLESS BENEVOLENCE WE POOR CHILDREN
RECOLLECT WHAT OUR EXCELLENT FATHER SO OFTEN TOLD US IT WAS NO ENGLISHMAN THAT THUS SAVED US MONTE CRISTO STARTED
PENELON COUNT IS THE OLD SAILOR YOU SAW IN THE GARDEN AND WHO FROM QUARTERMASTER HAS BECOME GARDENER
LEFT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN MY SISTER AND MYSELF FOR WE WERE HIS ONLY CHILDREN HER HUSBAND WHO WHEN HE MARRIED HER HAD NO OTHER PATRIMONY THAN HIS NOBLE PROBITY HIS FIRST RATE ABILITY AND HIS SPOTLESS REPUTATION WISHED TO POSSESS AS MUCH AS HIS WIFE
A SMALL LOW DOOR GAVE EGRESS FROM THE WALLED SPACE WE HAVE BEEN DESCRIBING INTO THE PROJECTED STREET THE GROUND HAVING BEEN ABANDONED AS UNPRODUCTIVE BY ITS VARIOUS RENTERS
BUT I WISHED TO HAVE YOUR ADVICE IS MY COUNSEL
AGAIN THE TIMID GIRL FOUND COURAGE TO RETURN TO THE GATE SAYING AS SHE DID SO AND WHY DO YOU COME SO LATE TO DAY IT IS ALMOST DINNER TIME AND I HAD TO USE NO LITTLE DIPLOMACY TO GET RID OF MY WATCHFUL MOTHER IN LAW MY TOO DEVOTED MAID AND MY TROUBLESOME BROTHER
CONSIDER BY BECOMING A GARDENER I EFFECTUALLY SCREEN OUR MEETINGS FROM ALL SUSPICION OR DANGER I BESEECH OF YOU MAXIMILIAN TO CEASE TRIFLING AND TELL ME WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN SIMPLY
MIGHT BE SEEN NEGLIGENTLY THROWN UPON THE STONE BENCH A BOOK A PARASOL AND A WORK BASKET FROM WHICH HUNG A PARTLY EMBROIDERED CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF WHILE AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM THESE ARTICLES WAS A YOUNG WOMAN STANDING CLOSE TO THE IRON GATE
ALAS NO MAXIMILIAN THIS MUST NOT BE FOR MANY REASONS WE SHOULD PRESUME TOO MUCH ON OUR OWN STRENGTH AND LIKE OTHERS PERHAPS BE LED ASTRAY BY OUR BLIND CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER'S PRUDENCE
SAW ON THE QUAY AN ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS ON THE POINT OF EMBARKING ON BOARD A YACHT AND HE RECOGNIZED HIM AS THE PERSON WHO CALLED ON MY FATHER THE FIFTH OF JUNE EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE AND WHO WROTE ME THIS LETTER ON THE FIFTH OF SEPTEMBER HE FELT CONVINCED OF HIS IDENTITY BUT HE DID NOT VENTURE TO ADDRESS HIM
CLAD IN A BLOUSE AND CAP A FAINT CRY OF MINGLED PLEASURE AND SURPRISE ESCAPED FROM THE LIPS OF VALENTINE WHO ALMOST INSTANTLY SAID IN A SADDENED TONE AS THOUGH SOME ENVIOUS CLOUD DARKENED THE JOY WHICH ILLUMINED HER HEART
NO NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO PALE AS DEATH PRESSING ONE HAND ON HIS HEART TO STILL ITS THROBBINGS WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE POINTED TO A CRYSTAL COVER BENEATH WHICH A SILKEN PURSE LAY ON A BLACK VELVET CUSHION
WITHOUT IN ANY WAY AFFECTING THE GROWTH OF OTHER LUXURIANT SHRUBS AND FLOWERS THAT EAGERLY DRESSED FORWARD TO FILL UP THE VACANT SPACES AS THOUGH ASSERTING THEIR RIGHT TO ENJOY THE BOON OF LIGHT AND AIR AT ONE CORNER
THAT I CAUSE NO SMALL DISTURBANCE IN YOUR HOUSE LOOK THERE SAID MAXIMILIAN LAUGHING THERE IS HER HUSBAND CHANGING HIS JACKET FOR A COAT
HE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE A LARGE VASE OF JAPAN PORCELAIN FILLED WITH FLOWERS THAT LOADED THE AIR WITH THEIR PERFUME STOOD IN THE SALON JULIE SUITABLY DRESSED AND HER HAIR ARRANGED SHE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THIS FEAT IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES RECEIVED THE COUNT ON HIS ENTRANCE
EVERYTHING IN THIS CHARMING RETREAT FROM THE WARBLE OF THE BIRDS TO THE SMILE OF THE MISTRESS BREATHED TRANQUILLITY AND REPOSE THE COUNT HAD FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THIS HAPPINESS FROM THE MOMENT HE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND HE REMAINED SILENT AND PENSIVE
WAS ABUNDANTLY JUSTIFIED IN THE CHOICE BY THE ABSENCE OF ALL GLARE THE COOL REFRESHING SHADE THE SCREEN IT AFFORDED FROM THE SCORCHING RAYS OF THE SUN THAT FOUND NO ENTRANCE THERE EVEN DURING THE BURNING DAYS OF HOTTEST SUMMER
HE MEANS THAT THE ARTICLES CONTAINED IN THIS PURSE ARE THE RELICS OF THE ANGEL I SPOKE OF JUST NOW THIS I DO NOT COMPREHEND AND YET I MAY NOT ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO BOWING
THOSE BORN TO WEALTH AND WHO HAVE THE MEANS OF GRATIFYING EVERY WISH SAID EMMANUEL KNOW NOT WHAT IS THE REAL HAPPINESS OF LIFE JUST AS THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN TOSSED ON THE STORMY WATERS OF THE OCEAN ON A FEW FRAIL PLANKS CAN ALONE REALIZE THE BLESSINGS OF FAIR WEATHER
WHICH IS EVIDENTLY NOT HIS REAL NAME BUT A FICTITIOUS ONE THEN NOTICING THAT JULIE WAS STRUCK WITH THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE TELL ME CONTINUED HE WAS HE NOT ABOUT MY HEIGHT PERHAPS A LITTLE TALLER WITH HIS CHIN IMPRISONED AS IT WERE IN A HIGH CRAVAT
DOOMED TO WANT AND WRETCHEDNESS CAN AT PRESENT HEAR EVERY ONE ENVYING OUR HAPPY LOT THIS LETTER AS HE SPOKE MAXIMILIAN DREW A LETTER FROM THE PURSE AND GAVE IT TO THE COUNT THIS LETTER WAS WRITTEN BY HIM THE DAY THAT MY FATHER HAD TAKEN A DESPERATE RESOLUTION
AND THAT YOUR FATHER WAS RESOLVED UPON COMPLETING THE MATCH
WHICH WAS FAINTLY DISCERNIBLE THROUGH THE DENSE MASS OF VERDURE THAT PARTIALLY CONCEALED IT THOUGH SITUATED BUT A HUNDRED PACES OFF WHOEVER HAD SELECTED THIS RETIRED PORTION OF THE GROUNDS AS THE BOUNDARY OF A WALK OR AS A PLACE FOR MEDITATION
AND THE PURCHASER OF THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAVING PAID A HIGH PRICE FOR IT AND BEING QUITE UNABLE TO FIND ANY ONE WILLING TO TAKE HIS BARGAIN OFF HIS HANDS WITHOUT A CONSIDERABLE LOSS YET STILL CLINGING TO THE BELIEF THAT AT SOME FUTURE DAY HE SHOULD OBTAIN A SUM FOR IT THAT WOULD REPAY HIM
WHERE HE RECEIVED HIS FRIENDS HE WAS SUPERINTENDING THE GROOMING OF HIS HORSE AND SMOKING HIS CIGAR AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GARDEN WHEN THE COUNT'S CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE GATE
AND RECIPROCALLY AS THEY SAY AT THE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL AT THE SOUND OF THEIR STEPS A YOUNG WOMAN OF TWENTY TO FIVE AND TWENTY DRESSED IN A SILK MORNING GOWN AND BUSILY ENGAGED IN PLUCKING THE DEAD LEAVES OFF A NOISETTE ROSE TREE RAISED HER HEAD
AND IN THE REAR OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPOSING MANSIONS IN THIS RICH NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE VARIOUS HOUSES VIE WITH EACH OTHER FOR ELEGANCE OF DESIGN AND MAGNIFICENCE OF CONSTRUCTION EXTENDED A LARGE GARDEN
AND YOU HAVE I AM SURE THE FULLEST CONFIDENCE IN MY HONOR WHEN YOU SPOKE TO ME OF EXPERIENCING A VAGUE AND INDEFINITE SENSE OF COMING DANGER I PLACED MYSELF BLINDLY AND DEVOTEDLY AT YOUR SERVICE ASKING NO OTHER REWARD THAN THE PLEASURE OF BEING USEFUL TO YOU
AND MONSIEUR MAXIMILIAN MORREL WOULD SEE HIS EXCELLENCY THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO CRIED MORREL THROWING AWAY HIS CIGAR AND HASTENING TO THE CARRIAGE I SHOULD THINK WE WOULD SEE HIM AH A THOUSAND THANKS COUNT FOR NOT HAVING FORGOTTEN YOUR PROMISE
AND SO AS WE HAVE SAID THE IRON GATE LEADING INTO THE KITCHEN GARDEN HAD BEEN CLOSED UP AND LEFT TO THE RUST WHICH BADE FAIR BEFORE LONG TO EAT OFF ITS HINGES WHILE TO PREVENT THE IGNOBLE GLANCES OF THE DIGGERS AND DELVERS OF THE GROUND
WHO IS ALWAYS TEASING ME ABOUT COMING TO WORK AT MY EMBROIDERY WHICH I AM IN A FAIR WAY NEVER TO GET DONE SO PRAY EXCUSE YOURSELF AS WELL AS YOU CAN FOR HAVING MADE ME WAIT AND AFTER THAT TELL ME WHY I SEE YOU IN A DRESS SO SINGULAR THAT AT FIRST I DID NOT RECOGNIZE YOU
BUT THE WHOLE AFFAIR HAS HAD A MYSTERIOUS MEANING THAT WE CANNOT COMPREHEND WE HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND A HAND AS POWERFUL AS THAT OF AN ENCHANTER OH CRIED JULIE I HAVE NOT LOST ALL HOPE OF SOME DAY KISSING THAT HAND AS I NOW KISS THE PURSE WHICH HE HAS TOUCHED
FORGETTING THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO RENEW THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD CEASED AFTER THE FIRST SALUTATIONS HAD BEEN EXCHANGED THE SILENCE BECAME ALMOST PAINFUL WHEN BY A VIOLENT EFFORT TEARING HIMSELF FROM HIS PLEASING REVERIE
BUT CONTENTMENT IS SO NEW A SIGHT TO ME THAT I COULD NEVER BE WEARY OF LOOKING AT YOURSELF AND YOUR HUSBAND WE ARE VERY HAPPY MONSIEUR REPLIED JULIE BUT WE HAVE ALSO KNOWN UNHAPPINESS AND FEW HAVE EVER UNDERGONE MORE BITTER SUFFERINGS THAN OURSELVES
AS THEY WAVED THEIR VARIEGATED LEAVES IN THE WIND AND CHARMED THE EYE WITH THEIR SCARLET BLOOM HAD FALLEN INTO UTTER DISUSE THE PROPRIETORS OF THE MANSION HAD MANY YEARS BEFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THE POSSESSION OF THE HOUSE ITSELF
BUT THE STRICT DECORUM AND RIGID PROPRIETY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE HOUSE LEFT NO GROUNDS FOR APPREHENDING THAT ADVANTAGE WOULD BE TAKEN OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE HORTICULTURE SEEMED HOWEVER TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED IN THE DESERTED KITCHEN GARDEN
WITH A TONE SO SWEET AND GENTLE THAT IT WENT TO MAXIMILIAN'S HEART LIKE THE VOICE OF A FATHER BUT THEY WILL NOT BE CONTENT WITH THAT YOUR BROTHER IN LAW IS A BARRISTER A DOCTOR HE WAS A MERCHANT MONSIEUR AND HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE BUSINESS OF MY POOR FATHER
PARDON ME I HAD NO INTENTION OF COMMITTING AN INDISCRETION INDISCRETION OH YOU MAKE US HAPPY BY GIVING US AN EXCUSE FOR EXPATIATING ON THIS SUBJECT IF WE WANTED TO CONCEAL THE NOBLE ACTION THIS PURSE COMMEMORATES WE SHOULD NOT EXPOSE IT THUS TO VIEW
WHICH HAD FOR SOME TIME BEEN INCREASING BECAME ALARMING HE COULD NOT SPEAK
HENCEFORTH WE HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR I AM ON MY OWN GROUND AND HAVE AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO PLACE A LADDER AGAINST THE WALL AND TO LOOK OVER WHEN I PLEASE WITHOUT HAVING ANY APPREHENSIONS OF BEING TAKEN OFF BY THE POLICE AS A SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER
LISTEN TO ME OUR HOUSE TRANSACTS BUSINESS TO THE AMOUNT OF A MILLION A YEAR FROM WHICH WE DERIVE AN INCOME OF FORTY THOUSAND FRANCS
IT IS NEEDLESS TO ADD THAT THERE WERE GOLD AND SILVER FISH IN THE BASIN THE HOUSE WITH KITCHENS AND CELLARS BELOW HAD ABOVE THE GROUND FLOOR TWO STORIES AND ATTICS
I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE WELL KNOWN IN THE RUE MESLAY YOUR FAMILY APPEARS TO BE A VERY HAPPY ONE SAID THE COUNT AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF OH YES I ASSURE YOU COUNT THEY WANT NOTHING THAT CAN RENDER THEM HAPPY
HIS COAT CLOSELY BUTTONED UP AND CONSTANTLY TAKING OUT HIS PENCIL
AND THE YOUNG OFFICER SHOOK THE COUNT'S HAND SO WARMLY THAT MONTE CRISTO COULD NOT BE MISTAKEN AS TO THE SINCERITY OF HIS JOY AND HE SAW THAT HE HAD BEEN EXPECTED WITH IMPATIENCE AND WAS RECEIVED WITH PLEASURE
HOW CAN YOU FOR AN INSTANT ENTERTAIN SO UNWORTHY A THOUGHT DEAR VALENTINE HAVE I NOT FROM THE FIRST BLESSED HOUR OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE SCHOOLED ALL MY WORDS AND ACTIONS TO YOUR SENTIMENTS AND IDEAS
THEY ARE YOUNG AND CHEERFUL THEY ARE TENDERLY ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER AND WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR THEY FANCY THEMSELVES AS RICH AS ROTHSCHILD FIVE AND TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS IS NOT A LARGE SUM HOWEVER REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
AND THIS DIAMOND WAS GIVEN BY THE GENEROUS UNKNOWN TO MY SISTER AS HER DOWRY MONTE CRISTO OPENED THE LETTER AND READ IT WITH AN INDESCRIBABLE FEELING OF DELIGHT IT WAS THE LETTER WRITTEN AS OUR READERS KNOW TO JULIE AND SIGNED SINBAD THE SAILOR
I HAVE CHOSEN A TRADE A TRADE OH MAXIMILIAN HOW CAN YOU JEST AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE SUCH DEEP CAUSE FOR UNEASINESS HEAVEN KEEP ME FROM JESTING WITH THAT WHICH IS FAR DEARER TO ME THAN LIFE ITSELF
OH WOULD WE COULD RELATE IT EVERYWHERE AND TO EVERY ONE SO THAT THE EMOTION OF OUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR MIGHT REVEAL HIS PRESENCE
HE WAS MY FRIEND HE HAD NO SECRETS FROM ME AND IF THIS HAD BEEN SO HE WOULD HAVE CONFIDED IN ME AND HE TOLD YOU NOTHING NOT A WORD NOTHING THAT WOULD LEAD YOU TO SUPPOSE NOTHING AND YET YOU SPOKE OF HIM AT ONCE AH IN SUCH A CASE ONE SUPPOSES
COME COME SAID MAXIMILIAN I WILL SERVE AS YOUR GUIDE SUCH A MAN AS YOU ARE OUGHT NOT TO BE INTRODUCED BY A SERVANT MY SISTER IS IN THE GARDEN PLUCKING THE DEAD ROSES MY BROTHER IS READING HIS TWO PAPERS THE PRESSE AND THE DEBATS WITHIN SIX STEPS OF HER
THIS WAS JULIE WHO HAD BECOME AS THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAD PREDICTED MADAME EMMANUEL HERBAULT SHE UTTERED A CRY OF SURPRISE AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGER AND MAXIMILIAN BEGAN TO LAUGH
WHERE THE FOLIAGE BECAME SO THICK AS ALMOST TO SHUT OUT DAY A LARGE STONE BENCH AND SUNDRY RUSTIC SEATS INDICATED THAT THIS SHELTERED SPOT WAS EITHER IN GENERAL FAVOR OR PARTICULAR USE BY SOME INHABITANT OF THE HOUSE
THAT COMPLETES THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FRANCS WE HAD FIXED AS THE LIMITS OF OUR GAINS
AT THAT INSTANT THE LITTLE SIDE GATE LEADING FROM THE WASTE GROUND TO THE STREET WAS NOISELESSLY OPENED AND A TALL POWERFUL YOUNG MAN APPEARED HE WAS DRESSED IN A COMMON GRAY BLOUSE AND VELVET CAP BUT HIS CAREFULLY ARRANGED HAIR BEARD AND MUSTACHE
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THOROUGHFARES IN THE CITY OF PARIS IN MATTERS OF SPECULATION HOWEVER THOUGH MAN PROPOSES MONEY DISPOSES FROM SOME SUCH DIFFICULTY THE NEWLY NAMED STREET DIED ALMOST IN BIRTH
THERE IS NOTHING NOW TO PREVENT MY BUILDING MYSELF A LITTLE HUT ON MY PLANTATION AND RESIDING NOT TWENTY YARDS FROM YOU ONLY IMAGINE WHAT HAPPINESS THAT WOULD AFFORD ME I CAN SCARCELY CONTAIN MYSELF AT THE BARE IDEA
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO STOP THE ISSUE OF ANY MORE AND CLOSE OUR OFFICE THIS WAS DONE INSTANTLY IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK AT A QUARTER PAST A MERCHANT PRESENTED HIMSELF TO INSURE TWO SHIPS IT WAS A CLEAR PROFIT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS
OH MONSIEUR THIS IS CRUEL OF YOU SAID JULIE MUCH AFFECTED AND THE YOUNG LADY'S EYES SWAM WITH TEARS MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO GRAVELY AND GAZING EARNESTLY ON THE TWO LIQUID PEARLS THAT TRICKLED DOWN JULIE'S CHEEKS
AND DO YOU KNOW THIS GENTLEMAN MONSIEUR INQUIRED EMMANUEL OH IF YOU DO KNOW HIM CRIED JULIE CAN YOU TELL US WHERE HE IS WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM MAXIMILIAN EMMANUEL IF WE DO BUT DISCOVER HIM HE MUST BELIEVE IN THE GRATITUDE OF THE HEART
THE HOUSE WAS OF WHITE STONE AND IN A SMALL COURT BEFORE IT WERE TWO SMALL BEDS FULL OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS
IS IT NOT WORTH THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS TO SAVE OUR FATHER'S NAME FROM THE CHANCES OF EVIL FORTUNE AND FAILURE
THE WHOLE OF THE PROPERTY CONSISTING OF AN IMMENSE WORKSHOP TWO PAVILIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN AND THE GARDEN ITSELF HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY EMMANUEL WHO HAD SEEN AT A GLANCE THAT HE COULD MAKE OF IT A PROFITABLE SPECULATION
NOT ONLY FOR HIS PAST OUTLAY BUT ALSO THE INTEREST UPON THE CAPITAL LOCKED UP IN HIS NEW ACQUISITION CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH LETTING THE GROUND TEMPORARILY TO SOME MARKET GARDENERS AT A YEARLY RENTAL OF FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS
A FEW LOCKS OF GRAY MINGLED WITH HIS HAIR WHICH WAS STILL THICK AND MATTED WHILE HIS BRONZED FEATURES AND DETERMINED GLANCE WELL SUITED AN OLD SAILOR WHO HAD BRAVED THE HEAT OF THE EQUATOR AND THE STORMS OF THE TROPICS I THINK YOU HAILED ME
YOU SEE IT IS NOT MY FAULT AND MAXIMILIAN WAS PATIENT AND EMPLOYED HIMSELF IN MENTALLY CONTRASTING THE TWO GIRLS ONE FAIR WITH SOFT LANGUISHING EYES A FIGURE GRACEFULLY BENDING LIKE A WEEPING WILLOW
BUT THAT CANNOT APPLY TO THE TIME PREVIOUS TO OUR ACQUAINTANCE VALENTINE
BUT LET ME HEAR THIS SECOND PROOF WHICH YOU YOURSELF OWN TO BE ABSURD WELL LOOK THROUGH THIS OPENING AND YOU WILL SEE THE BEAUTIFUL NEW HORSE WHICH I RODE HERE AH WHAT A BEAUTIFUL CREATURE CRIED VALENTINE
WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS POSSIBLE TO EXPEND A THOUSAND LOUIS UPON A DINNER FOR TEN PERSONS BUT ONLY ON THE CONDITION OF EATING PEARLS LIKE CLEOPATRA OR DRINKING REFINED GOLD LIKE LORENZO DE MEDICI
BUT OF SUCH A KIND AS THE ARABIAN FAIRIES MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO PREPARE EVERY DELICIOUS FRUIT THAT THE FOUR QUARTERS OF THE GLOBE COULD PROVIDE WAS HEAPED IN VASES FROM CHINA AND JARS FROM JAPAN
AND HAVE YOU SUCCEEDED I THINK SO
DID I NOT TELL YOU JUST NOW THAT I WAS RICH MAXIMILIAN TOO RICH
YES BEFORE WITNESSES OH THIS IS VERY INTERESTING SAID DEBRAY IF THERE REALLY HAS BEEN A CRIME WE WILL INVESTIGATE IT THERE HAS BEEN A CRIME SAID MONTE CRISTO COME THIS WAY GENTLEMEN
AH YES SAID MONTE CRISTO SMILING IT IS ALL A MATTER OF IMAGINATION WHY SHOULD WE NOT IMAGINE THIS THE APARTMENT OF AN HONEST MOTHER AND THIS BED WITH RED HANGINGS A BED VISITED BY THE GODDESS LUCINA
HAS THE SUN DONE ANYTHING FOR ME NO HE WARMS ME WITH HIS RAYS AND IT IS BY HIS LIGHT THAT I SEE YOU NOTHING MORE HAS SUCH AND SUCH A PERFUME DONE ANYTHING FOR ME NO ITS ODOR CHARMS ONE OF MY SENSES
AS I RODE BY THE COUNT'S HOUSE I PERCEIVED A LIGHT IN ONE OF THE WINDOWS AND FANCIED I SAW THE SHADOW OF HIS FIGURE MOVING BEHIND THE CURTAIN NOW VALENTINE I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT HE KNEW OF MY WISH TO POSSESS THIS HORSE
A CULPRIT TO DEATH YOU M DEBRAY IN PACIFYING A KINGDOM
HALF SCREENED FROM VIEW BY THE LARGE CHESTNUT TREES WHICH ON ALL SIDES SPREAD THEIR LUXURIANT BRANCHES WE SHALL FIND SOME PEOPLE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE THIS TIME MAXIMILIAN WAS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE
I OWN THAT YOUR QUESTION EMBARRASSES ME VALENTINE FOR I CANNOT SAY THAT THE COUNT HAS RENDERED ME ANY OSTENSIBLE SERVICE STILL AS I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOU I HAVE AN INSTINCTIVE AFFECTION FOR HIM THE SOURCE OF WHICH I CANNOT EXPLAIN TO YOU
WERE ALREADY SCATTERED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE HOUSE FOR THEY THOUGHT THE VISIT WOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO THE ONE ROOM AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME THEY WOULD OBTAIN A VIEW OF THE REST OF THE BUILDING OF WHICH MONTE CRISTO HAD CREATED A PALACE EACH ONE WENT OUT BY THE OPEN DOORS
THAT WILL ACCOUNT TO YOU FOR THE UNRESERVED MANNER WHICH YOU OBSERVED BETWEEN ME AND EUGENIE AS IN SPEAKING OF THE MAN WHOM I COULD NOT LOVE MY THOUGHTS INVOLUNTARILY REVERTED TO HIM ON WHOM MY AFFECTIONS WERE FIXED
EXTRAORDINARY DID YOU SAY YES YOU HAVE KNOWN HIM FOR SOME TIME THEN SCARCELY LONGER THAN EIGHT OR TEN DAYS
YES IT WAS HE WHO SAVED THE LIFE OF YOUR STEP MOTHER AND HER SON THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO THE SAME
MONTE CRISTO NOTICED THE GENERAL ASTONISHMENT AND BEGAN LAUGHING AND JOKING ABOUT IT GENTLEMEN HE SAID YOU WILL ADMIT THAT WHEN ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN DEGREE OF FORTUNE THE SUPERFLUITIES OF LIFE ARE ALL THAT CAN BE DESIRED
BUT WHY MUST YOU LEAVE ME SO SOON I DO NOT KNOW PARTICULARS
THERE WAS NOTHING PARTICULAR ABOUT IT EXCEPTING THAT ALTHOUGH DAYLIGHT HAD DISAPPEARED IT WAS NOT LIGHTED AND EVERYTHING IN IT WAS OLD FASHIONED WHILE THE REST OF THE ROOMS HAD BEEN REDECORATED THESE TWO CAUSES WERE ENOUGH TO GIVE IT A GLOOMY ASPECT
WOULD HAVE ALARMED THEM MUCH MORE THAN A VISIT TO THE ROOM THEY WERE ABOUT TO ENTER THEY BEGAN BY WALKING THROUGH THE APARTMENTS MANY OF WHICH WERE FITTED UP IN THE EASTERN STYLE WITH CUSHIONS AND DIVANS INSTEAD OF BEDS AND PIPES INSTEAD OF FURNITURE
IF YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE OF THE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED THE WOODEN PARTITION WHICH INTERPOSED BETWEEN US AND YOU HAS PROVED BUT A SLIGHT SECURITY COME WHAT DID SHE SAY SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE LOVED NO ONE SAID VALENTINE
AND THAT MYSTERIOUS STAIRCASE THE PASSAGE THROUGH WHICH NOT TO DISTURB THEIR SLEEP THE DOCTOR AND NURSE PASS OR EVEN THE FATHER CARRYING THE SLEEPING CHILD
IS BURNING WITH THE DESIRE OF SEEING THIS EXTRAORDINARY NABOB IN HIS OWN HOUSE THEREFORE SHE HAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PREVAILED ON MY FATHER TO ACCOMPANY HER NO NO IT IS AS I HAVE SAID MAXIMILIAN
THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WHOM HE LOVES AND I HAD ALMOST SAID BY WHOM HE IS BELOVED IN RETURN WHEN HE LEARNED MY RESOLUTION I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE REPROACHFUL LOOK WHICH HE CAST ON ME
AND THOSE TWO CRAYON PORTRAITS THAT HAVE FADED FROM THE DAMPNESS DO THEY NOT SEEM TO SAY WITH THEIR PALE LIPS AND STARING EYES WE HAVE SEEN VILLEFORT BECAME LIVID
AND THEN WE WILL TAKE COFFEE IN THE GARDEN AFTER DINNER THE PLAY MONTE CRISTO LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT HIS GUESTS
AH SAID VALENTINE IN A MOURNFUL TONE DO LET ME SEE THIS MAN MAXIMILIAN HE MAY TELL ME WHETHER I SHALL EVER BE LOVED SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE AMENDS FOR ALL I HAVE SUFFERED MY POOR GIRL YOU KNOW HIM ALREADY I KNOW HIM
WHY NOT BECAUSE I SCARCELY KNOW WHY
THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE INTUITIVE PERCEPTION OF A LOVER QUICKLY UNDERSTOOD THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH SHE WAS INVOLUNTARILY PLACED AND HE WAS COMFORTED BESIDES ALTHOUGH SHE AVOIDED COMING WITHIN SPEAKING DISTANCE
AND YOU MORREL IN BREAKING A HORSE THAT NO ONE CAN RIDE FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE THESE TWO FISH
I NEVER PLAY FOR I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO AFFORD TO LOSE OR SUFFICIENTLY POOR TO DESIRE TO GAIN BUT I WAS AT MY OWN HOUSE YOU UNDERSTAND SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT TO SEND FOR THE CARDS WHICH I DID JUST AS THEY WERE SITTING DOWN TO TABLE
AND I HAVE ALSO A DEEP CONVICTION THAT HEAVEN WOULD NOT HAVE CREATED TWO HEARTS HARMONIZING AS OURS DO AND ALMOST MIRACULOUSLY BROUGHT US TOGETHER TO SEPARATE US AT LAST THOSE ARE KIND AND CHEERING WORDS
AH VALENTINE I ASSURE YOU YOU ARE MISTAKEN IF IT WERE OTHERWISE IF HE TREATED ME DIPLOMATICALLY THAT IS TO SAY LIKE A MAN WHO WISHES BY SOME MEANS OR OTHER TO OBTAIN A FOOTING IN THE HOUSE SO THAT HE MAY ULTIMATELY GAIN THE POWER OF DICTATING TO ITS OCCUPANTS
ADMIRED BY MY FATHER WHO SAYS HE HAS NEVER BEFORE HEARD SUCH SUBLIME IDEAS SO ELOQUENTLY EXPRESSED IDOLIZED BY EDWARD WHO NOTWITHSTANDING HIS FEAR OF THE COUNT'S LARGE BLACK EYES RUNS TO MEET HIM THE MOMENT HE ARRIVES
WELL MY MAN DIGGING FOUND A BOX OR RATHER THE IRON WORK OF A BOX IN THE MIDST OF WHICH WAS THE SKELETON OF A NEWLY BORN INFANT MONTE CRISTO FELT THE ARM OF MADAME DANGLARS STIFFEN WHILE THAT OF VILLEFORT TREMBLED
YOU ARE THE SUBJECT ON WHICH I WISH TO SPEAK TRUE WE MUST BE QUICK FOR WE HAVE SCARCELY TEN MINUTES MORE TO PASS TOGETHER MA FOI SAID MAXIMILIAN IN CONSTERNATION YES YOU ARE RIGHT I AM BUT A POOR FRIEND TO YOU
TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS I DARE SAY IT IS SOMETHING DISPARAGING WHICH YOU ARE GOING TO SAY IT ONLY PROVES HOW LITTLE INDULGENCE WE MAY EXPECT FROM YOUR SEX INTERRUPTED VALENTINE YOU CANNOT AT LEAST DENY THAT YOU ARE VERY HARSH JUDGES OF EACH OTHER
AND THAT THEIR EXTERIORS CARRIED THE IMPRESS OF THEIR CHARACTERS THIS HOUSE WAS GLOOMY BECAUSE IT WAS REMORSEFUL IT WAS REMORSEFUL BECAUSE IT CONCEALED A CRIME
MONTE CRISTO WAITED FOR THE TWO WHO REMAINED THEN WHEN THEY HAD PASSED HE BROUGHT UP THE REAR AND ON HIS FACE WAS A SMILE
AND MAJOR CAVALCANTI WHO IS AN ITALIAN WILL TELL YOU THE NAME OF THE OTHER THIS ONE IS I THINK A STERLET SAID CHATEAU RENAUD AND THAT ONE IF I MISTAKE NOT A LAMPREY JUST SO
AND HE CONDUCTED THE GUESTS BACK TO THE TABLE ON THE LAWN INDEED COUNT SAID MADAME DANGLARS I AM ASHAMED TO OWN IT BUT ALL YOUR FRIGHTFUL STORIES HAVE SO UPSET ME THAT I MUST BEG YOU TO LET ME SIT DOWN AND SHE FELL INTO A CHAIR
VALENTINE MOUNTED ON A BENCH AND PASSED NOT ONLY HER FINGER BUT HER WHOLE HAND THROUGH THE OPENING MAXIMILIAN UTTERED A CRY OF DELIGHT AND SPRINGING FORWARDS SEIZED THE HAND EXTENDED TOWARDS HIM AND IMPRINTED ON IT A FERVENT AND IMPASSIONED KISS
ON THE COUNT'S INVITATION OFFERED HIS ARM
MANY OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE THE IMPORT OF WHICH WAS A UNANIMOUS OPINION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING SINISTER ABOUT THE ROOM IS IT NOT SO ASKED MONTE CRISTO LOOK AT THAT LARGE CLUMSY BED HUNG WITH SUCH GLOOMY BLOOD COLORED DRAPERY
IT IS MARRIAGE ITSELF MARRIAGE IF SHE DISLIKES THAT SO MUCH WHY DID SHE EVER MARRY HERSELF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME MAXIMILIAN ABOUT A YEAR AGO I TALKED OF RETIRING TO A CONVENT
I SHALL MEET THEM THERE AND WHO KNOWS WHAT FUTURE ADVANTAGES MAY RESULT FROM THE INTERVIEW THIS MAY APPEAR TO YOU TO BE NO UNUSUAL COMBINATION OF CIRCUMSTANCES NEVERTHELESS I PERCEIVE SOME HIDDEN PLOT IN THE ARRANGEMENT
SHE PROPOSED TO MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE A WALK IN THE GARDEN BEING ANXIOUS TO SHOW THAT THE DELAY WHICH WAS DOUBTLESS A CAUSE OF VEXATION TO HIM WAS NOT OCCASIONED BY ANY NEGLECT ON HER PART
AND THAT HE LOST EXPRESSLY TO GIVE ME THE MEANS OF PROCURING HIM MY DEAR MAXIMILIAN YOU ARE REALLY TOO FANCIFUL YOU WILL NOT LOVE EVEN ME LONG A MAN WHO ACCUSTOMS HIMSELF TO LIVE IN SUCH A WORLD OF POETRY AND IMAGINATION
AND ON MY HONOR WITHOUT AT ALL WISHING TO DEPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANY MAN CAN REALLY LOVE HER THE FACT IS MAXIMILIAN
AND YET ASTONISHED EVEN UNEASY THOUGH THEY WERE THEY STILL FELT THAT THEY WOULD NOT LIKE TO BE ABSENT THE RECENT EVENTS THE SOLITARY AND ECCENTRIC POSITION OF THE COUNT HIS ENORMOUS NAY ALMOST INCREDIBLE FORTUNE
DEAR MAXIMILIAN WHY NOT ATTRIBUTE YOUR ESCAPE TO MY CONSTANT PRAYERS FOR YOUR SAFETY WHEN YOU ARE AWAY I NO LONGER PRAY FOR MYSELF BUT FOR YOU YES SINCE YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SAID MORREL SMILING
SHE PASSED OVER TO MONTE CRISTO A BOTTLE FULL OF THE SAME KIND OF RED LIQUID WHOSE GOOD PROPERTIES THE COUNT HAD TESTED ON EDWARD AH SAID MONTE CRISTO TAKING IT FROM HER HAND YES SHE SAID AT YOUR ADVICE I HAVE MADE THE TRIAL
AN IDEA WHICH CARRIES YOU BACK TO OTHER TIMES TO OTHER PLACES WHICH VERY LIKELY HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH THE PRESENT TIME AND PLACE
AND THAT YOU ARE ONLY NOW OCCUPIED IN A REMINISCENCE OF THE PAST YES
WELL MONSIEUR FRANZ IS HIS FRIEND YOU KNOW WHAT THEN MONSIEUR DE MORCERF HAS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM FRANZ ANNOUNCING HIS IMMEDIATE RETURN VALENTINE TURNED PALE AND LEANED HER HAND AGAINST THE GATE
SOMETHING IN FACT MORE THAN IS APPARENT ON A CASUAL VIEW OF THE SUBJECT I BELIEVE THAT THIS SINGULAR MAN WHO APPEARS TO FATHOM THE MOTIVES OF EVERY ONE
UTTERED A GROAN AND FAINTED
THEY MAY DO WHAT THEY WILL WITH ME I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU WHEN I HAD CEASED SPEAKING HE THANKFULLY RAISED HIS EYES TO HEAVEN BUT WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD AH MAXIMILIAN I MAY HAVE MUCH TO SUFFER
BUT WITH ME IT HAS BEEN PRODUCTIVE OF EVIL RATHER THAN GOOD WELL VALENTINE SAID MORREL WITH A SIGH WE WILL NOT DISCUSS THE MATTER FURTHER I WILL NOT MAKE A CONFIDANT OF HIM ALAS SAID VALENTINE
THE OTHER A BRUNETTE WITH A FIERCE AND HAUGHTY EXPRESSION AND AS STRAIGHT AS A POPLAR IT IS UNNECESSARY TO STATE THAT IN THE EYES OF THE YOUNG MAN VALENTINE DID NOT SUFFER BY THE CONTRAST IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR THE GIRLS WENT AWAY
AND HIS HAND ENDOWED WITH THE POWER OF DIRECTING EVENTS ACCORDING TO HIS OWN WILL HE MUST BE A PROPHET THEN SAID VALENTINE SMILING INDEED SAID MAXIMILIAN I HAVE OFTEN BEEN ALMOST TEMPTED TO ATTRIBUTE TO HIM THE GIFT OF PROPHECY
YOU WOULD LOVE ME AS MUCH IF I WERE POOR WOULD YOU NOT MAXIMILIAN OH I SHALL ALWAYS LOVE YOU WHAT SHOULD I CARE FOR EITHER RICHES OR POVERTY IF MY VALENTINE WAS NEAR ME AND I FELT CERTAIN THAT NO ONE COULD DEPRIVE ME OF HER
WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED DEBRAY IN A WHISPER OF MADAME DANGLARS NOTHING SHE REPLIED WITH A VIOLENT EFFORT I WANT AIR THAT IS ALL
AND OPENS HIS HAND IN WHICH HE IS SURE TO FIND SOME DELIGHTFUL PRESENT M DE MONTE CRISTO APPEARS TO EXERT A MYSTERIOUS AND ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE INFLUENCE OVER ALL THE MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY IF SUCH BE THE CASE MY DEAR VALENTINE
MEDEAH WAS STANDING AT THE RACK EATING HIS HAY I IMMEDIATELY PUT ON THE SADDLE AND BRIDLE TO WHICH OPERATION HE LENT HIMSELF WITH THE BEST GRACE POSSIBLE
MONTE CRISTO SEEING THAT THE TWO PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD PREPARED THIS SCENE COULD SCARCELY ENDURE IT AND NOT WISHING TO CARRY IT TOO FAR SAID COME GENTLEMEN SOME COFFEE WE SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN IT
I SHOULD TAKE YOU FOR A VISIONARY AND SHOULD TREMBLE FOR YOUR REASON
IF WE ARE SO IT IS BECAUSE WE GENERALLY JUDGE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXCITEMENT BUT RETURN TO YOUR QUESTION DOES MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS OBJECT TO THIS MARRIAGE WITH M DE MORCERF ON ACCOUNT OF LOVING ANOTHER
LOOK AT IT AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF IT WHAT A WICKED LOOKING CROOKED STAIRCASE SAID CHATEAU RENAUD WITH A SMILE
AND THEN YOU KNOW HE SAID AN IDEA A SUPPOSITION IS SUFFICIENT WELL SAID MONTE CRISTO YOU MAY BELIEVE ME IF YOU LIKE BUT IT IS MY OPINION THAT A CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED IN THIS HOUSE TAKE CARE SAID MADAME DE VILLEFORT THE KING'S ATTORNEY IS HERE
REALLY MADAME HE SAID DID I ALARM YOU MUCH OH NO SIR SHE ANSWERED BUT YOU KNOW THINGS IMPRESS US DIFFERENTLY ACCORDING TO THE MOOD OF OUR MINDS
WHY DID YOU NOT BRING HIM CLOSE TO THE GATE SO THAT I COULD TALK TO HIM AND PAT HIM HE IS AS YOU SEE A VERY VALUABLE ANIMAL SAID MAXIMILIAN YOU KNOW THAT MY MEANS ARE LIMITED AND THAT I AM WHAT WOULD BE DESIGNATED A MAN OF MODERATE PRETENSIONS
AND THEN SAID MONTE CRISTO THIS IS NOT ALL WHAT IS THERE MORE SAID DEBRAY WHO HAD NOT FAILED TO NOTICE THE AGITATION OF MADAME DANGLARS
IN HIS MOST SIMPLE ACTIONS AS WELL AS IN HIS MOST SECRET THOUGHTS I FIND A RELATION TO MY OWN
THIS GARDEN HAS NEVER BEEN A CEMETERY WHAT IS DONE TO INFANTICIDES IN THIS COUNTRY ASKED MAJOR CAVALCANTI INNOCENTLY OH THEIR HEADS ARE SOON CUT OFF SAID DANGLARS AH INDEED SAID CAVALCANTI
THEY WERE PLACED IN A WAGON BUILT ON PURPOSE AND THUS THE STERLET LIVED TWELVE DAYS THE LAMPREY EIGHT AND BOTH WERE ALIVE WHEN MY COOK SEIZED THEM KILLING ONE WITH MILK AND THE OTHER WITH WINE YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ME M DANGLARS
WHAT IS IT THAT WE REALLY DESIRE THAT WHICH WE CANNOT OBTAIN NOW TO SEE THINGS WHICH I CANNOT UNDERSTAND TO PROCURE IMPOSSIBILITIES THESE ARE THE STUDY OF MY LIFE I GRATIFY MY WISHES BY TWO MEANS
HAS PURPOSELY ARRANGED FOR ME TO MEET M AND MADAME DE VILLEFORT AND SOMETIMES I CONFESS I HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO TRY TO READ IN HIS EYES WHETHER HE WAS IN POSSESSION OF THE SECRET OF OUR LOVE MY GOOD FRIEND SAID VALENTINE
BUT AS HE WAS NOT ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN POETICAL IDEAS HE HAD GONE INTO THE GARDEN AND WAS TALKING WITH MAJOR CAVALCANTI ON THE PROJECTED RAILWAY FROM LEGHORN TO FLORENCE MONTE CRISTO SEEMED IN DESPAIR
THE LITTLEST FINGER OF ALL THAT I MAY HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF KISSING IT MAXIMILIAN WE SAID WE WOULD BE TO EACH OTHER AS TWO VOICES TWO SHADOWS AS YOU WILL VALENTINE SHALL YOU BE HAPPY IF I DO WHAT YOU WISH OH YES
WHEN TO MORROW WHERE IN MY OFFICE OR IN THE COURT IF YOU LIKE THAT IS THE SUREST PLACE I WILL BE THERE
BUT CERTAINLY EVERYTHING APPEARS TO ME BLACK IN THIS HOUSE SAID DEBRAY EVER SINCE VALENTINE'S DOWRY HAD BEEN MENTIONED MORREL HAD BEEN SILENT AND SAD CAN YOU IMAGINE SAID MONTE CRISTO
NAY FURTHER HAVE YOU NEVER ENDEAVORED TO RECALL THE TIME PLACE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR FORMER INTERCOURSE AND FAILING IN THIS ATTEMPT HAVE ALMOST BELIEVED THAT YOUR SPIRITS MUST HAVE HELD CONVERSE WITH EACH OTHER IN SOME STATE OF BEING ANTERIOR TO THE PRESENT
BUT I FEAR YOU WILL DEEM IT EVEN MORE ABSURD THAN THE FIRST SO MUCH THE WORSE SAID VALENTINE SMILING IT IS NEVERTHELESS CONCLUSIVE TO MY MIND MY TEN YEARS OF SERVICE HAVE ALSO CONFIRMED MY IDEAS ON THE SUBJECT OF SUDDEN INSPIRATIONS
IT IS NOT JUST THAT HE SHOULD DESPISE ME SO WITHOUT ANY REASON AH FORGIVE ME SAID VALENTINE PERCEIVING THE EFFECT WHICH HER WORDS WERE PRODUCING ON MAXIMILIAN
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU CAN SEE ANYTHING MORE THAN THE MEREST CHANCE IN THIS MEETING PRAY REFLECT A LITTLE MY FATHER WHO NEVER GOES OUT HAS SEVERAL TIMES BEEN ON THE POINT OF REFUSING THIS INVITATION MADAME DE VILLEFORT ON THE CONTRARY
VALENTINE ARRANGED SO THAT MAXIMILIAN COULD SEE HER PASS AND REPASS AND EACH TIME SHE WENT BY SHE MANAGED UNPERCEIVED BY HER COMPANION TO CAST AN EXPRESSIVE LOOK AT THE YOUNG MAN WHICH SEEMED TO SAY HAVE PATIENCE
GOOD EVENING VALENTINE SAID A WELL KNOWN VOICE GOOD EVENING MAXIMILIAN I KNOW I HAVE KEPT YOU WAITING BUT YOU SAW THE CAUSE OF MY DELAY YES I RECOGNIZED MADEMOISELLE DANGLARS
FOUR SERVANTS CARRIED IN TWO CASKS COVERED WITH AQUATIC PLANTS AND IN EACH OF WHICH WAS BREATHING A FISH SIMILAR TO THOSE ON THE TABLE
I WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP AS YOU MAY IMAGINE BUT I OWN I WENT AWAY WITH RATHER A HEAVY HEART FOR THE HORSE HAD LOOKED AT ME AFFECTIONATELY HAD RUBBED HIS HEAD AGAINST ME AND WHEN I MOUNTED HIM HAD PRANCED IN THE MOST DELIGHTFUL WAY IMAGINABLE
RARE BIRDS RETAINING THEIR MOST BRILLIANT PLUMAGE ENORMOUS FISH SPREAD UPON MASSIVE SILVER DISHES TOGETHER WITH EVERY WINE PRODUCED IN THE ARCHIPELAGO ASIA MINOR OR THE CAPE
THE LITTLE HAND WAS THEN IMMEDIATELY WITHDRAWN
IT CANNOT BE SURELY VALENTINE YOU ARE MISTAKEN NO INDEED I AM NOT FOR I ASSURE YOU HIS POWER OVER OUR HOUSEHOLD IS ALMOST UNLIMITED COURTED BY MY STEP MOTHER WHO REGARDS HIM AS THE EPITOME OF HUMAN WISDOM
MERELY BECAUSE ONE MIGHT HAVE DIED CARELESSLY ANSWERED MONTE CRISTO YOU ARE CERTAINLY AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN SAID DANGLARS AND PHILOSOPHERS MAY WELL SAY IT IS A FINE THING TO BE RICH AND TO HAVE IDEAS ADDED MADAME DANGLARS
THE REPAST WAS MAGNIFICENT MONTE CRISTO HAD ENDEAVORED COMPLETELY TO OVERTURN THE PARISIAN IDEAS
IT LOOKED SO GLOOMY I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BOUGHT IT IF MY STEWARD HAD NOT TAKEN THE MATTER INTO HIS OWN HANDS PERHAPS THE FELLOW HAD BEEN BRIBED BY THE NOTARY
AND ALL PRESENT EVEN INCLUDING CAVALCANTI AND HIS SON NOTWITHSTANDING THE STIFFNESS OF THE ONE AND THE CARELESSNESS OF THE OTHER WERE THOUGHTFUL ON FINDING THEMSELVES ASSEMBLED AT THE HOUSE OF THIS INCOMPREHENSIBLE MAN
AS SHE HAD A COMMUNICATION TO MAKE ON WHICH A PART OF MY FORTUNE DEPENDED LET THEM TAKE MY FORTUNE I AM ALREADY TOO RICH AND PERHAPS WHEN THEY HAVE TAKEN IT THEY WILL LEAVE ME IN PEACE AND QUIETNESS
YES SAID MADAME DE VILLEFORT THE DOOR WAS TOWARDS THE ROAD BEFORE AND ON THE DAY OF MY MIRACULOUS ESCAPE YOU BROUGHT ME INTO THE HOUSE FROM THE ROAD I REMEMBER YES MADAME SAID MONTE CRISTO
HE APPEARS RATHER TO AVOID ME AH HE IS NOT GENEROUS NEITHER DOES HE POSSESS THAT SUPERNATURAL PENETRATION WHICH YOU ATTRIBUTE TO HIM FOR IF HE DID HE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED THAT I WAS UNHAPPY AND IF HE HAD BEEN GENEROUS SEEING ME SAD AND SOLITARY
WE HAVE AT PISA UGOLINO'S TOWER AT FERRARA TASSO'S PRISON AT RIMINI THE ROOM OF FRANCESCA AND PAOLO YES BUT YOU HAVE NOT THIS LITTLE STAIRCASE SAID MONTE CRISTO OPENING A DOOR CONCEALED BY THE DRAPERY
AH MADAME CRIED DEBRAY WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU HOW PALE YOU LOOK IT IS VERY EVIDENT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH HER SAID MADAME DE VILLEFORT M DE MONTE CRISTO IS RELATING HORRIBLE STORIES TO US DOUBTLESS INTENDING TO FRIGHTEN US TO DEATH
HOWEVER I HAVE MANAGED TO LIVE THIRTY YEARS WITHOUT THIS PROTECTION YOU WILL SAY BUT I WILL ENDEAVOR A LITTLE TO ILLUSTRATE MY MEANING HE INVITED ME TO DINE WITH HIM ON SATURDAY WHICH WAS A VERY NATURAL THING FOR HIM TO DO WELL WHAT HAVE I LEARNED SINCE
WHERE THE SHADE WAS THICKEST ALL THE OTHER GUESTS FOLLOWED
HE PERCEIVED THAT TWO WERE APPROACHING HIM THE DELAY HAD BEEN OCCASIONED BY A VISIT FROM MADAME DANGLARS AND EUGENIE WHICH HAD BEEN PROLONGED BEYOND THE TIME AT WHICH VALENTINE WAS EXPECTED
BUT THE GENTLE VOICE WHICH USUALLY HAS SUCH POWER OVER ME FAILS TO CONVINCE ME TO DAY I FEEL THE SAME AS REGARDS YOURSELF SAID VALENTINE AND I OWN THAT IF YOU HAVE NO STRONGER PROOF TO GIVE ME I HAVE ANOTHER REPLIED MAXIMILIAN
AND I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SABRING RIGHT AND LEFT AMONG THE BEDOUINS CAN HAVE DONE TO MERIT YOUR BEING REVEALED TO ME UNLESS INDEED HEAVEN TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT THE VICTIMS OF MY SWORD WERE INFIDELS
I TOLD YOU I WAS NOT ON TERMS OF STRICT INTIMACY WITH EUGENIE YES BUT GIRLS TELL EACH OTHER SECRETS WITHOUT BEING PARTICULARLY INTIMATE OWN NOW THAT YOU DID QUESTION HER ON THE SUBJECT AH I SEE YOU ARE SMILING
HE WAS INTENTLY WATCHING FOR A SHADOW TO APPEAR AMONG THE TREES AND AWAITING WITH ANXIETY THE SOUND OF A LIGHT STEP ON THE GRAVEL WALK AT LENGTH THE LONG DESIRED SOUND WAS HEARD AND INSTEAD OF ONE FIGURE AS HE HAD EXPECTED
OH DO NOT GIVE ME CREDIT FOR THIS MADAME IT WAS DONE BY THE ROMANS WHO MUCH ESTEEMED THEM AND PLINY RELATES THAT THEY SENT SLAVES FROM OSTIA TO ROME WHO CARRIED ON THEIR HEADS FISH WHICH HE CALLS THE MULUS AND WHICH FROM THE DESCRIPTION MUST PROBABLY BE THE GOLDFISH
WHEN HE FELT THE ARM OF THE BARONESS PRESS UPON HIS OWN NONE OF THIS HAD ESCAPED THE COUNT AND EVEN BY THIS MERE CONTACT OF INDIVIDUALS THE SCENE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED CONSIDERABLE INTEREST FOR AN OBSERVER
AH MAXIMILIAN I HAD HOPED YOU SET A HIGHER VALUE ON THE TITLE OF FRIEND YOUR LOGIC IS MOST POWERFUL VALENTINE BUT SAY WHAT YOU WILL I CAN NEVER RENOUNCE THE SENTIMENT WHICH HAS INSTINCTIVELY TAKEN POSSESSION OF MY MIND
FOR A DECLARATION TO BE AVAILABLE SHOULD BE MADE BEFORE THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES HE THEN TOOK VILLEFORT'S ARM
NOT BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO DO THAT SAID VALENTINE WITH A SAD SMILE IF SHE OBJECTS TO YOUR MARRYING M D'EPINAY SHE WOULD BE ALL THE MORE LIKELY TO LISTEN TO ANY OTHER PROPOSITION NO MAXIMILIAN IT IS NOT SUITORS TO WHICH MADAME DE VILLEFORT OBJECTS
MONTE CRISTO DID THE SAME AND THE REST FOLLOWED THEIR EXAMPLE
SO THAT I WAS ALTOGETHER FASCINATED WITH HIM THE SAME EVENING SOME FRIENDS OF MINE VISITED ME M DE CHATEAU RENAUD M DEBRAY AND FIVE OR SIX OTHER CHOICE SPIRITS WHOM YOU DO NOT KNOW EVEN BY NAME
I SEE THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU PAIN I CAN ONLY SAY HOW SINCERELY I ASK PARDON FOR HAVING GRIEFED YOU BUT INDEED I AM NOT PREJUDICED BEYOND THE POWER OF CONVICTION TELL ME WHAT THIS COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO HAS DONE FOR YOU
THERE IS NO ONE IN THE WORLD OF WHOM I CAN ASK HELP BUT YOURSELF AND MY GRANDFATHER WHO IS LITTLE BETTER THAN A CORPSE
FOR THE BEAUTY OF EITHER IS NOT THE ONLY QUALITY WE SEEK IT IS YOUR LOVE WHICH MAKES YOU LOOK UPON EVERYTHING IN THAT LIGHT NO VALENTINE I ASSURE YOU SUCH IS NOT THE CASE I WAS OBSERVING YOU BOTH WHEN YOU WERE WALKING IN THE GARDEN
BUT I FEEL AS IF MY GRANDFATHER'S LOOK AT THAT MOMENT WOULD MORE THAN COMPENSATE FOR ALL
AND INSTEAD OF IMMEDIATELY DIRECTING HER STEPS TOWARDS THE GATE SHE SEATED HERSELF ON A BENCH AND CAREFULLY CASTING HER EYES AROUND TO CONVINCE HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT WATCHED SHE PRESENTLY AROSE AND PROCEEDED QUICKLY TO JOIN MAXIMILIAN
AND SAVE ME FROM THE ANGER OF THE SEA GOD NEPTUNE FOR I APPROACH YOU PRAYERFULLY ANY ONE WHO HAS LOST HIS WAY HAS AT ALL TIMES A CLAIM EVEN UPON THE GODS
WHO WILL NOT LET HIM GO AND HE CANNOT GET BACK TO HIS OWN COUNTRY FOR HE CAN FIND NEITHER SHIPS NOR SAILORS TO TAKE HIM OVER THE SEA FURTHERMORE
I SHALL NO LONGER BE HELD IN ANY SORT OF RESPECT AMONG YOU GODS IF MORTALS LIKE THE PHAEACIANS WHO ARE MY OWN FLESH AND BLOOD SHOW SUCH SMALL REGARD FOR ME
BUT THE GODS DELIVER HIM FROM EVIL SO WAS ULYSSES THANKFUL WHEN HE AGAIN SAW LAND AND TREES AND SWAM ON WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH THAT HE MIGHT ONCE MORE SET FOOT UPON DRY GROUND
AND WILL SEND YOU A FAIR WIND TO TAKE YOU HOME IF THE GODS IN HEAVEN SO WILL IT FOR THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT THESE THINGS AND CAN SETTLE THEM BETTER THAN I CAN ULYSSES SHUDDERED AS HE HEARD HER NOW GODDESS HE ANSWERED
UPON HIS OWN SOIL HE HAD BEEN SO LONG AWAY THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IT AGAIN MOREOVER
THUS DID HE SPEAK AND THEY ALL HELD THEIR PEACE THROUGHOUT THE COVERED CLOISTER ENTHRALLED BY THE CHARM OF HIS STORY TILL PRESENTLY ALCINOUS BEGAN TO SPEAK ULYSSES SAID HE
WHEN THEY GOT TO THE WATER SIDE THE CREW TOOK THESE THINGS AND PUT THEM ON BOARD WITH ALL THE MEAT AND DRINK BUT FOR ULYSSES THEY SPREAD A RUG AND A LINEN SHEET ON DECK THAT HE MIGHT SLEEP SOUNDLY IN THE STERN OF THE SHIP
AND HERE HE THOUGHT WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE FOR THERE WERE NO ROCKS AND IT AFFORDED SHELTER FROM THE WIND HE FELT THAT THERE WAS A CURRENT SO HE PRAYED INWARDLY AND SAID HEAR ME O KING WHOEVER YOU MAY BE
NEVERTHELESS I WILL READILY GIVE HIM SUCH ADVICE IN ALL GOOD FAITH AS WILL BE LIKELY TO BRING HIM SAFELY TO HIS OWN COUNTRY THEN SEND HIM AWAY SAID MERCURY OR JOVE WILL BE ANGRY WITH YOU AND PUNISH YOU ON THIS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE
DID AS HE WAS TOLD FORTHWITH HE BOUND ON HIS GLITTERING GOLDEN SANDALS WITH WHICH HE COULD FLY LIKE THE WIND OVER LAND AND SEA HE TOOK THE WAND WITH WHICH HE SEALS MEN'S EYES IN SLEEP
WHY IS NEPTUNE SO FURIOUSLY ANGRY WITH YOU HE IS GIVING YOU A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE BUT FOR ALL HIS BLUSTER HE WILL NOT KILL YOU YOU SEEM TO BE A SENSIBLE PERSON DO THEN AS I BID YOU STRIP
CALYPSO SET MEAT AND DRINK BEFORE HIM OF THE FOOD THAT MORTALS EAT BUT HER MAIDS BROUGHT AMBROSIA AND NECTAR FOR HERSELF AND THEY LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE BEFORE THEM
SAYING BLESS MY HEART WHO IS IT THAT CAN HAVE ROOTED THE SHIP IN THE SEA JUST AS SHE WAS GETTING INTO PORT WE COULD SEE THE WHOLE OF HER
LET US NOW THEREFORE PRESENT HIM FURTHER EACH ONE OF US WITH A LARGE TRIPOD AND A CAULDRON WE WILL RECOUP OURSELVES BY THE LEVY OF A GENERAL RATE
HE IS TO BE CONVOYED NEITHER BY GODS NOR MEN BUT AFTER A PERILOUS VOYAGE OF TWENTY DAYS UPON A RAFT
HIS ORDERS HE SAYS THAT YOU HAVE HERE THE MOST ILL STARRED OF ALL THOSE WHO FOUGHT NINE YEARS BEFORE THE CITY OF KING PRIAM AND SAILED HOME IN THE TENTH YEAR AFTER HAVING SACKED IT
OF HIS FATHER WHAT MY DEAR ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT REPLIED HER FATHER DID YOU NOT SEND HIM THERE YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP ULYSSES TO GET HOME AND PUNISH THE SUITORS
THEN SHE DIVED DOWN AGAIN LIKE A SEA GULL AND VANISHED BENEATH THE DARK BLUE WATERS BUT ULYSSES DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY
WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS THEY WERE AFRAID AND GOT READY THE BULLS
BUT KING NEPTUNE WHO WAS RETURNING FROM THE ETHIOPIANS CAUGHT SIGHT OF ULYSSES A LONG WAY OFF FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF THE SOLYMI HE COULD SEE HIM SAILING UPON THE SEA AND IT MADE HIM VERY ANGRY
THEREON HE FLOATED ABOUT FOR TWO NIGHTS AND TWO DAYS IN THE WATER WITH A HEAVY SWELL ON THE SEA AND DEATH STARING HIM IN THE FACE BUT WHEN THE THIRD DAY BROKE THE WIND FELL AND THERE WAS A DEAD CALM WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A BREATH OF AIR STIRRING
SEEMED TO BE STILL A GOOD WAY OFF I KNOW WHAT I WILL DO I AM SURE IT WILL BE BEST NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I WILL STICK TO THE RAFT AS LONG AS HER TIMBERS HOLD TOGETHER BUT WHEN THE SEA BREAKS HER UP I WILL SWIM FOR IT
FOR THERE WAS A GREAT LITTER OF DEAD LEAVES LYING ABOUT ENOUGH TO MAKE A COVERING FOR TWO OR THREE MEN EVEN IN HARD WINTER WEATHER HE WAS GLAD ENOUGH TO SEE THIS SO HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND HEAPED THE LEAVES ALL ROUND HIM
IF HE HAD HAD HIS SHARE OF THE SPOIL AND GOT HOME WITHOUT MISADVENTURE AND JOVE ANSWERED WHAT O LORD OF THE EARTHQUAKE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
THE FIRST THING THEY DID WAS TO LIFT ULYSSES WITH HIS RUG AND LINEN SHEET OUT OF THE SHIP AND LAY HIM DOWN UPON THE SAND STILL FAST ASLEEP
WHEN THEY HAD SATISFIED THEMSELVES WITH MEAT AND DRINK CALYPSO SPOKE SAYING
SO AGAIN WHEN CERES FELL IN LOVE WITH IASION AND YIELDED TO HIM IN A THRICE PLOUGHED FALLOW FIELD
AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR YOU WHEN SHE HAD THUS SPOKEN SHE LED THE WAY RAPIDLY BEFORE HIM AND ULYSSES FOLLOWED IN HER STEPS SO THE PAIR GODDESS AND MAN WENT ON AND ON TILL THEY CAME TO CALYPSO'S CAVE
THAT IT BROKE THE MAST HALF WAY UP AND BOTH SAIL AND YARD WENT OVER INTO THE SEA FOR A LONG TIME ULYSSES WAS UNDER WATER
AND ALL YOU OTHER GODS THAT LIVE IN EVERLASTING BLISS I HOPE THERE MAY NEVER BE SUCH A THING AS A KIND AND WELL DISPOSED RULER ANY MORE NOR ONE WHO WILL GOVERN EQUITABLY I HOPE
EVEN SO DID ULYSSES REJOICE WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN AND HE AT ONCE SAID TO THE PHAEACIANS ADDRESSING HIMSELF MORE PARTICULARLY TO KING ALCINOUS SIR AND ALL OF YOU FAREWELL
BUT PRESENTLY THE WAVE CAME ON AGAIN AND CARRIED HIM BACK WITH IT FAR INTO THE SEA TEARING HIS HANDS AS THE SUCKERS OF A POLYPUS ARE TORN WHEN SOME ONE PLUCKS IT FROM ITS BED
BUT SHALL RETURN TO HIS HOUSE AND COUNTRY AND SEE HIS FRIENDS AGAIN CALYPSO TREMBLED WITH RAGE WHEN SHE HEARD THIS YOU GODS SHE EXCLAIMED OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES
BOUNDED FORWARD ON HER WAY AS A FOUR IN HAND CHARIOT FLIES OVER THE COURSE WHEN THE HORSES FEEL THE WHIP HER PROW CURVETTED AS IT WERE THE NECK OF A STALLION AND A GREAT WAVE OF DARK BLUE WATER SEETHED IN HER WAKE
DAYS SEVEN AND TEN DID HE SAIL OVER THE SEA AND ON THE EIGHTEENTH THE DIM OUTLINES OF THE MOUNTAINS ON THE NEAREST PART OF THE PHAEACIAN COAST APPEARED RISING LIKE A SHIELD ON THE HORIZON
BUT AT LAST HE GOT HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER AND SPAT OUT THE BITTER BRINE THAT WAS RUNNING DOWN HIS FACE IN STREAMS IN SPITE OF ALL THIS HOWEVER
I DO NOT THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I HAVE LET YOU OFF TOO LIGHTLY ON THIS HE LASHED HIS HORSES
HE MADE THE RAFT AS BROAD AS A SKILLED SHIPWRIGHT
A VINE LOADED WITH GRAPES WAS TRAINED AND GREW LUXURIANTLY ABOUT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE
INASMUCH AS HE HAD SPOKEN REASONABLY ALCINOUS THEREFORE SAID TO HIS SERVANT PONTONOUS MIX SOME WINE AND HAND IT ROUND TO EVERYBODY THAT WE MAY OFFER A PRAYER TO FATHER JOVE AND SPEED OUR GUEST UPON HIS WAY
FAREWELL QUEEN SAID HE HENCEFORWARD AND FOR EVER TILL AGE AND DEATH THE COMMON LOT OF MANKIND LAY THEIR HANDS UPON YOU I NOW TAKE MY LEAVE
WHEREON INO RECEIVED IT INTO HER HANDS FROM THE WAVE THAT BORE IT TOWARDS HER THEN HE LEFT THE RIVER LAID HIMSELF DOWN AMONG THE RUSHES AND KISSED
SO GO CUT SOME BEAMS OF WOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF A LARGE RAFT WITH AN UPPER DECK THAT IT MAY CARRY YOU SAFELY OVER THE SEA I WILL PUT BREAD WINE AND WATER ON BOARD TO SAVE YOU FROM STARVING I WILL ALSO GIVE YOU CLOTHES
THIS IS ONLY SOME ONE OR OTHER OF THE GODS WHO IS LURING ME TO RUIN BY ADVISING ME TO QUIT MY RAFT AT ANY RATE I WILL NOT DO SO AT PRESENT FOR THE LAND WHERE SHE SAID I SHOULD BE QUIT OF ALL TROUBLES
LOW LYING ROCKS AND MOUNTAIN TOPS ULYSSES HEART NOW BEGAN TO FAIL HIM AND HE SAID DESPAIRINGLY TO HIMSELF ALAS JOVE HAS LET ME SEE LAND AFTER SWIMMING SO FAR THAT I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE
I DO NOT SEE HOW I CAN DO ANY BETTER THAN THIS WHILE HE WAS THUS IN TWO MINDS NEPTUNE SENT A TERRIBLE GREAT WAVE THAT SEEMED TO REAR ITSELF ABOVE HIS HEAD TILL IT BROKE RIGHT OVER THE RAFT
THAT WOULD HAVE IT SO AS FOR THE DAY TIME HE SPENT IT ON THE ROCKS AND ON THE SEA SHORE WEEPING CRYING ALOUD FOR HIS DESPAIR AND ALWAYS LOOKING OUT UPON THE SEA
LEAVE YOUR RAFT TO DRIVE BEFORE THE WIND AND SWIM TO THE PHAEACIAN COAST WHERE BETTER LUCK AWAITS YOU AND HERE TAKE MY VEIL AND PUT IT ROUND YOUR CHEST IT IS ENCHANTED AND YOU CAN COME TO NO HARM SO LONG AS YOU WEAR IT
SEEING IN WHAT GREAT DISTRESS ULYSSES NOW WAS SHE HAD COMPASSION UPON HIM AND RISING LIKE A SEA GULL FROM THE WAVES TOOK HER SEAT UPON THE RAFT MY POOR GOOD MAN SAID SHE
AND LET ME SET REFRESHMENT BEFORE YOU AS SHE SPOKE SHE DREW A TABLE LOADED WITH AMBROSIA BESIDE HIM AND MIXED HIM SOME RED NECTAR SO MERCURY ATE AND DRANK TILL HE HAD HAD ENOUGH
BUT ULYSSES WAS NOT WITHIN HE WAS ON THE SEA SHORE AS USUAL LOOKING OUT UPON THE BARREN OCEAN WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES GROANING AND BREAKING HIS HEART FOR SORROW CALYPSO GAVE MERCURY A SEAT AND SAID
BUT MINERVA RESOLVED TO HELP ULYSSES SO SHE BOUND THE WAYS OF ALL THE WINDS EXCEPT ONE AND MADE THEM LIE QUITE STILL BUT SHE ROUSED A GOOD STIFF BREEZE FROM THE NORTH THAT SHOULD LAY THE WATERS TILL ULYSSES REACHED THE LAND OF THE PHAEACIANS WHERE HE WOULD BE SAFE
HE EXCLAIMED AMONG WHAT MANNER OF PEOPLE AM I FALLEN ARE THEY SAVAGE AND UNCIVILISED OR HOSPITABLE AND HUMANE WHERE SHALL I PUT ALL THIS TREASURE AND WHICH WAY SHALL I GO
AND TURNED HITHER AND THITHER
THEN THEY WENT TO THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS TO GET DINNER AND HE SACRIFICED A BULL FOR THEM IN HONOUR OF JOVE WHO IS THE LORD OF ALL THEY SET THE STEAKS TO GRILL AND MADE AN EXCELLENT DINNER
AND CALYPSO WENT OUT TO LOOK FOR ULYSSES FOR SHE HAD HEARD JOVE'S MESSAGE SHE FOUND HIM SITTING UPON THE BEACH WITH HIS EYES EVER FILLED WITH TEARS AND DYING OF SHEER HOME SICKNESS
AND THEN SAID WE ARE SPEAKING GOD AND GODDESS TO ONE ANOTHER AND YOU ASK ME WHY I HAVE COME HERE AND I WILL TELL YOU TRULY AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO JOVE SENT ME IT WAS NO DOING OF MINE
I AM AFRAID SOME GREAT WAVE WILL LIFT ME OFF MY LEGS AND DASH ME AGAINST THE ROCKS AS I LEAVE THE WATER WHICH WOULD GIVE ME A SORRY LANDING IF ON THE OTHER HAND I SWIM FURTHER IN SEARCH OF SOME SHELVING BEACH OR HARBOUR
WHICH THEN WENT TO PIECES AS THOUGH IT WERE A HEAP OF DRY CHAFF TOSSED ABOUT BY A WHIRLWIND ULYSSES GOT ASTRIDE OF ONE PLANK AND RODE UPON IT AS IF HE WERE ON HORSEBACK HE THEN TOOK OFF THE CLOTHES CALYPSO HAD GIVEN HIM
AS IT WAS RETURNING FROM AN ESCORT AND BURY OUR CITY UNDER A HIGH MOUNTAIN
SO MERCURY STOOD STILL AND LOOKED AT IT BUT WHEN HE HAD ADMIRED IT SUFFICIENTLY HE WENT INSIDE THE CAVE CALYPSO KNEW HIM AT ONCE FOR THE GODS ALL KNOW EACH OTHER NO MATTER HOW FAR THEY LIVE FROM ONE ANOTHER
WHO ARE NEAR OF KIN TO THE GODS AND WILL HONOUR HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE ONE OF OURSELVES THEY WILL SEND HIM IN A SHIP TO HIS OWN COUNTRY AND WILL GIVE HIM MORE BRONZE AND GOLD AND RAIMENT THAN HE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM TROY
MOREOVER SHE MADE THE WIND FAIR AND WARM FOR HIM AND GLADLY DID ULYSSES SPREAD HIS SAIL BEFORE IT WHILE HE SAT AND GUIDED THE RAFT SKILFULLY BY MEANS OF THE RUDDER
FOR THE SWELL STILL BROKE AGAINST THEM WITH A TERRIFIC ROAR EVERYTHING WAS ENVELOPED IN SPRAY THERE WERE NO HARBOURS WHERE A SHIP MIGHT RIDE NOR SHELTER OF ANY KIND BUT ONLY HEADLANDS
AS HE SPOKE A SEA BROKE OVER HIM WITH SUCH TERRIFIC FURY THAT THE RAFT REELED AGAIN AND HE WAS CARRIED OVERBOARD A LONG WAY OFF
AS HE ROSE ON THE SWELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY AHEAD AND COULD SEE LAND QUITE NEAR THEN AS CHILDREN REJOICE WHEN THEIR DEAR FATHER BEGINS TO GET BETTER AFTER HAVING FOR A LONG TIME BORNE SORE AFFLICTION SENT HIM BY SOME ANGRY SPIRIT
WHEN HE HAD THUS SPOKEN HE SAID TO HIS SON MERCURY MERCURY YOU ARE OUR MESSENGER GO THEREFORE AND TELL CALYPSO WE HAVE DECREED THAT POOR ULYSSES IS TO RETURN HOME
WHICH LIES BETWEEN TWO POINTS THAT BREAK THE LINE OF THE SEA AND SHUT THE HARBOUR IN
AGAINST THE ROCKS THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN SMASHED AND TORN TO PIECES IF MINERVA HAD NOT SHOWN HIM WHAT TO DO HE CAUGHT HOLD OF THE ROCK WITH BOTH HANDS AND CLUNG TO IT GROANING WITH PAIN TILL THE WAVE RETIRED SO HE WAS SAVED THAT TIME
SO THAT ALL HIS BRAVE COMPANIONS PERISHED AND HE ALONE WAS CARRIED HITHER BY WIND AND TIDE JOVE SAYS THAT YOU ARE TO LET THIS MAN GO AT ONCE FOR IT IS DECREED THAT HE SHALL NOT PERISH HERE FAR FROM HIS OWN PEOPLE
AND NOW YOU ARE ANGRY WITH ME TOO BECAUSE I HAVE A MAN HERE I FOUND THE POOR CREATURE SITTING ALL ALONE ASTRIDE OF A KEEL FOR JOVE HAD STRUCK HIS SHIP WITH LIGHTNING AND SUNK IT IN MID OCEAN
FORGETFUL OF ALL THAT HE HAD SUFFERED BOTH ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND BY THE WAVES OF THE WEARY SEA WHEN THE BRIGHT STAR THAT HERALDS THE APPROACH OF DAWN BEGAN TO SHOW
NOW THAT YOU HAVE REACHED MY HOUSE I DOUBT NOT YOU WILL GET HOME WITHOUT FURTHER MISADVENTURE NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU HAVE SUFFERED IN THE PAST TO YOU OTHERS HOWEVER WHO COME HERE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT
WICKED PEOPLE ARE NOW TRYING TO MURDER HIS ONLY SON TELEMACHUS WHO IS COMING HOME FROM PYLOS AND LACEDAEMON
THE OTHERS EACH FROM HIS OWN SEAT MADE A DRINK OFFERING TO THE BLESSED GODS THAT LIVE IN HEAVEN
I AM SO EXHAUSTED THAT THE BITTER COLD AND DAMP MAY MAKE AN END OF ME FOR TOWARDS SUNRISE THERE WILL BE A KEEN WIND BLOWING FROM OFF THE RIVER IF ON THE OTHER HAND I CLIMB THE HILL SIDE FIND SHELTER IN THE WOODS AND SLEEP IN SOME THICKET
BREEDS MANY SUCH AND I KNOW THAT NEPTUNE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME WHILE HE WAS THUS IN TWO MINDS A WAVE CAUGHT HIM AND TOOK HIM WITH SUCH FORCE
WHEN HE WAS IN THIS PLIGHT INO DAUGHTER OF CADMUS ALSO CALLED LEUCOTHEA SAW HIM SHE HAD FORMERLY BEEN A MERE MORTAL BUT HAD BEEN SINCE RAISED TO THE RANK OF A MARINE GODDESS
OR WAKES THEM JUST AS HE PLEASES
AS SOON AS YOU TOUCH LAND TAKE IT OFF THROW IT BACK AS FAR AS YOU CAN INTO THE SEA AND THEN GO AWAY AGAIN WITH THESE WORDS
BESIDES YOU ARE PERFECTLY ABLE TO PROTECT TELEMACHUS AND TO SEE HIM SAFELY HOME AGAIN WHILE THE SUITORS HAVE TO COME HURRY SKURRYING BACK WITHOUT HAVING KILLED HIM
A HURRICANE MAY CARRY ME OUT TO SEA AGAIN SORELY AGAINST MY WILL OR HEAVEN MAY SEND SOME GREAT MONSTER OF THE DEEP TO ATTACK ME FOR AMPHITRITE
BOUND INO'S VEIL UNDER HIS ARMS AND PLUNGED INTO THE SEA MEANING TO SWIM ON SHORE KING NEPTUNE WATCHED HIM AS HE DID SO AND WAGGED HIS HEAD MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND SAYING THERE NOW SWIM UP AND DOWN AS YOU BEST CAN
THEREON MINERVA BEGAN TO TELL THEM OF THE MANY SUFFERINGS OF ULYSSES FOR SHE PITIED HIM AWAY THERE IN THE HOUSE OF THE NYMPH CALYPSO FATHER JOVE SAID SHE
SO THAT HE COULD NEITHER BREATHE
WINDS FROM EAST SOUTH NORTH AND WEST FELL UPON HIM ALL AT THE SAME TIME AND A TREMENDOUS SEA GOT UP SO THAT ULYSSES HEART BEGAN TO FAIL HIM ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY WHAT EVER WILL BECOME OF ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE WE MUST LEAVE OFF GIVING PEOPLE ESCORTS WHEN THEY COME HERE AND IN THE NEXT LET US SACRIFICE TWELVE PICKED BULLS TO NEPTUNE THAT HE MAY HAVE MERCY UPON US AND NOT BURY OUR CITY UNDER THE HIGH MOUNTAIN
POPLAR AND SWEET SMELLING CYPRESS TREES WHEREIN ALL KINDS OF GREAT BIRDS HAD BUILT THEIR NESTS OWLS HAWKS AND CHATTERING SEA CROWS THAT OCCUPY THEIR BUSINESS IN THE WATERS
YOU ARE ALWAYS JEALOUS AND HATE SEEING A GODDESS TAKE A FANCY TO A MORTAL MAN AND LIVE WITH HIM IN OPEN MATRIMONY SO WHEN ROSY FINGERED DAWN MADE LOVE TO ORION
IT HAS TWO ENTRANCES ONE FACING NORTH BY WHICH MORTALS CAN GO DOWN INTO THE CAVE WHILE THE OTHER COMES FROM THE SOUTH AND IS MORE MYSTERIOUS MORTALS CANNOT POSSIBLY GET IN BY IT IT IS THE WAY TAKEN BY THE GODS INTO THIS HARBOUR
I MAY ESCAPE THE COLD AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S REST BUT SOME SAVAGE BEAST MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME AND DEVOUR ME
THEN THEY TOOK OUT THE PRESENTS WHICH MINERVA HAD PERSUADED THE PHAEACIANS TO GIVE HIM WHEN HE WAS SETTING OUT ON HIS VOYAGE HOMEWARDS THEY PUT THESE ALL TOGETHER BY THE ROOT OF THE OLIVE TREE AWAY FROM THE ROAD
FOR THERE IS NOT ONE OF HIS SUBJECTS BUT HAS FORGOTTEN ULYSSES WHO RULED THEM AS THOUGH HE WERE THEIR FATHER THERE HE IS LYING IN GREAT PAIN IN AN ISLAND WHERE DWELLS THE NYMPH CALYPSO
AND ONE COULD SMELL FROM FAR THE FRAGRANT REEK OF BURNING CEDAR AND SANDAL WOOD AS FOR HERSELF SHE WAS BUSY AT HER LOOM SHOOTING HER GOLDEN SHUTTLE THROUGH THE WARP AND SINGING BEAUTIFULLY ROUND HER CAVE THERE WAS A THICK WOOD OF ALDER
I AM NOW SAFE TO PERISH BLEST AND THRICE BLEST WERE THOSE DANAANS WHO FELL BEFORE TROY IN THE CAUSE OF THE SONS OF ATREUS WOULD THAT I HAD BEEN KILLED ON THE DAY WHEN THE TROJANS WERE PRESSING ME SO SORELY ABOUT THE DEAD BODY OF ACHILLES
POOR ULYSSES WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY PERISHED EVEN IN SPITE OF HIS OWN DESTINY IF MINERVA HAD NOT HELPED HIM TO KEEP HIS WITS ABOUT HIM HE SWAM SEAWARD AGAIN BEYOND REACH OF THE SURF THAT WAS BEATING AGAINST THE LAND
HE DID NOT LOSE SIGHT OF HIS RAFT BUT SWAM AS FAST AS HE COULD TOWARDS IT GOT HOLD OF IT AND CLIMBED ON BOARD AGAIN SO AS TO ESCAPE DROWNING THE SEA TOOK THE RAFT AND TOSSED IT ABOUT AS AUTUMN WINDS WHIRL THISTLEDOWN ROUND AND ROUND UPON A ROAD
BUT THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND ALCINOUS SAID I REMEMBER NOW THE OLD PROPHECY OF MY FATHER HE SAID THAT NEPTUNE WOULD BE ANGRY WITH US FOR TAKING EVERY ONE SO SAFELY OVER THE SEA AND WOULD ONE DAY WRECK A PHAEACIAN SHIP
AFTER WHICH THE INSPIRED BARD DEMODOCUS WHO WAS A FAVOURITE WITH EVERY ONE SANG TO THEM BUT ULYSSES KEPT ON TURNING HIS EYES TOWARDS THE SUN AS THOUGH TO HASTEN HIS SETTING FOR HE WAS LONGING TO BE ON HIS WAY
AND MAKING ME PRESENTS WHICH HEAVEN GRANT THAT I MAY TURN TO GOOD ACCOUNT
AND NOW HE IS CLOSE TO THE LAND OF THE PHAEACIANS WHERE IT IS DECREED THAT HE SHALL ESCAPE FROM THE CALAMITIES THAT HAVE BEFALLEN HIM STILL HE SHALL HAVE PLENTY OF HARDSHIP YET BEFORE HE HAS DONE WITH IT
NOT EVEN A WELL FOUND SHIP WITH A FAIR WIND COULD VENTURE ON SUCH A DISTANT VOYAGE NOTHING THAT YOU CAN SAY OR DO SHALL MAKE ME GO ON BOARD A RAFT UNLESS YOU FIRST SOLEMNLY SWEAR
YOUR PEOPLE AND WITH KING ALCINOUS AS HE SPOKE HE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD AND ALCINOUS SENT A MAN TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS SHIP AND TO THE SEA SHORE
CALYPSO BROUGHT HIM SOME LINEN TO MAKE THE SAILS AND HE MADE THESE TOO EXCELLENTLY MAKING THEM FAST WITH BRACES AND SHEETS LAST OF ALL WITH THE HELP OF LEVERS HE DREW THE RAFT DOWN INTO THE WATER IN FOUR DAYS
STILL I CANNOT CROSS JOVE NOR BRING HIS COUNSELS TO NOTHING THEREFORE IF HE INSISTS UPON IT LET THE MAN GO BEYOND THE SEAS AGAIN BUT I CANNOT SEND HIM ANYWHERE MYSELF FOR I HAVE NEITHER SHIPS NOR MEN WHO CAN TAKE HIM
I AM AFRAID CALYPSO WAS RIGHT WHEN SHE SAID I SHOULD HAVE TROUBLE BY SEA BEFORE I GOT BACK HOME IT IS ALL COMING TRUE HOW BLACK IS JOVE MAKING HEAVEN WITH HIS CLOUDS AND WHAT A SEA THE WINDS ARE RAISING FROM EVERY QUARTER AT ONCE
TURNED IT INTO STONE AND DROVE IT DOWN WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HAND SO AS TO ROOT IT IN THE GROUND AFTER THIS HE WENT AWAY THE PHAEACIANS THEN BEGAN TALKING AMONG THEMSELVES AND ONE WOULD TURN TOWARDS HIS NEIGHBOUR
BUT NOW THEY HAVE BROUGHT HIM IN A SHIP FAST ASLEEP AND HAVE LANDED HIM IN ITHACA AFTER LOADING HIM WITH MORE MAGNIFICENT PRESENTS OF BRONZE GOLD AND RAIMENT THAN HE WOULD EVER HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM TROY
CALYPSO SMILED AT THIS AND CARESSED HIM WITH HER HAND YOU KNOW A GREAT DEAL SAID SHE BUT YOU ARE QUITE WRONG HERE MAY HEAVEN ABOVE AND EARTH BELOW BE MY WITNESSES WITH THE WATERS OF THE RIVER STYX
HE CUT DOWN TWENTY TREES IN ALL AND ADZED THEM SMOOTH SQUARING THEM BY RULE IN GOOD WORKMANLIKE FASHION MEANWHILE CALYPSO CAME BACK WITH SOME AUGERS SO HE BORED HOLES WITH THEM AND FITTED THE TIMBERS TOGETHER WITH BOLTS AND RIVETS
SO THAT WHEN ONCE WITHIN IT A SHIP MAY LIE WITHOUT BEING EVEN MOORED AT THE HEAD OF THIS HARBOUR THERE IS A LARGE OLIVE TREE
AND THE STONES COME UP ALONG WITH IT EVEN SO DID THE ROCKS TEAR THE SKIN FROM HIS STRONG HANDS AND THEN THE WAVE DREW HIM DEEP DOWN UNDER THE WATER HERE
AS ONE WHO HAS BEEN ALL DAY PLOUGHING A FALLOW FIELD WITH A COUPLE OF OXEN KEEPS THINKING ABOUT HIS SUPPER AND IS GLAD WHEN NIGHT COMES THAT HE MAY GO AND GET IT FOR IT IS ALL HIS LEGS CAN DO TO CARRY HIM
BUT I CAN FIND NO LANDING PLACE FOR THE COAST IS ROCKY AND SURF BEATEN THE ROCKS ARE SMOOTH AND RISE SHEER FROM THE SEA WITH DEEP WATER CLOSE UNDER THEM SO THAT I CANNOT CLIMB OUT FOR WANT OF FOOT HOLD
THE PRECIPICES AND THE GOODLY TREES APPEARED ALL CHANGED AS HE STARTED UP AND LOOKED UPON HIS NATIVE LAND SO HE SMOTE HIS THIGHS WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HANDS AND CRIED ALOUD DESPAIRINGLY ALAS
HE ALSO MADE A MAST WITH A YARD ARM AND A RUDDER TO STEER WITH HE FENCED THE RAFT ALL ROUND WITH WICKER HURDLES AS A PROTECTION AGAINST THE WAVES AND THEN HE THREW ON A QUANTITY OF WOOD BY AND BY
I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO AT ONCE REPLIED NEPTUNE IF I WERE NOT ANXIOUS TO AVOID ANYTHING THAT MIGHT DISPLEASE YOU NOW THEREFORE I SHOULD LIKE TO WRECK THE PHAEACIAN SHIP AS IT IS RETURNING FROM ITS ESCORT
THEN AS ONE WHO LIVES ALONE IN THE COUNTRY FAR FROM ANY NEIGHBOR HIDES A BRAND AS FIRE SEED IN THE ASHES TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM HAVING TO GET A LIGHT ELSEWHERE
HE HAD COMPLETED THE WHOLE WORK AND ON THE FIFTH CALYPSO SENT HIM FROM THE ISLAND AFTER WASHING HIM AND GIVING HIM SOME CLEAN CLOTHES SHE GAVE HIM A GOAT SKIN FULL OF BLACK WINE AND ANOTHER LARGER ONE OF WATER
THEY HURRIED DOWN TO THE SHIP AND BROUGHT THEIR CAULDRONS WITH THEM ALCINOUS WENT ON BOARD AND SAW EVERYTHING SO SECURELY STOWED UNDER THE SHIP'S BENCHES THAT NOTHING COULD BREAK ADRIFT AND INJURE THE ROWERS
HAVE MERCY UPON ME O KING FOR I DECLARE MYSELF YOUR SUPPLIANT THEN THE GOD STAID HIS STREAM AND STILLED THE WAVES MAKING ALL CALM BEFORE HIM AND BRINGING HIM SAFELY INTO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER HERE
MOREOVER THERE ARE GREAT LOOMS OF STONE ON WHICH THE NYMPHS WEAVE THEIR ROBES OF SEA PURPLE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE AND AT ALL TIMES THERE IS WATER WITHIN IT
I ENDEAVOURED TO BRING ONE WITH ME BUT IT WAS TOO CUMBERSOME AND MY SALT WATER PEGASUS SEEMED MUCH DISPLEASED AT EVERY ATTEMPT TO STOP HIS CAREER WHILST I CONTINUED UPON HIS BACK
THE CONTRAST WAS TOO STRIKING BUT HE ALONE HYACINTH'S ONLY HELP SURELY SHE WOULD APPRECIATE HIS MAGNANIMITY ALSO AS HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF A MOMENT AGO
HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THE THENARDIER WOMAN DID IN FACT RUSH HASTILY INTO THE ROOM RED PANTING BREATHLESS WITH FLAMING EYES AND CRIED AS SHE SMOTE HER HUGE HANDS ON HER THIGHS SIMULTANEOUSLY
AND LET HER MAKE THE IMPRESSION OF HER FINGERS UPON THE WAVES RATHER THAN HIS FACE HE WAS NOT MUCH OUT IN HIS IDEAS OF THE CONSEQUENCE FOR MEETING NO OPPOSITION SHE WENT DIRECTLY OVERBOARD
ALMOST INCAPABLE OF MOVEMENT OR REFLECTION AS THOUGH ANNIHILATED BY THE ABOMINABLE THINGS VIEWED AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS HE WAITED IN THE HOPE OF SOME INCIDENT NO MATTER OF WHAT NATURE
THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME WRITE WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO WRITE THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME SAY WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO SAY HE STRIPPED UP HIS LEFT SLEEVE AND ADDED SEE HERE
CARRYING THEIR HEADS AT THE EXTREMITY OF THEIR TAILS I CROSSED CONTINUED HE ONE PRODIGIOUS RANGE OF ROCKS EQUAL IN HEIGHT TO THE ALPS THE TOPS OR HIGHEST PARTS OF THESE MARINE MOUNTAINS
THERE WERE ANY ADVENTURES IN EURALIA FOR A HUMBLE FELLOW LIKE HIMSELF CORONEL SAID A SMALL VOICE BEHIND HIM HE TURNED ROUND INDIFFERENTLY
IT WAS BY THE PERIL OF THE ONE HE LOVED THAT HE FELT HIMSELF RESTRAINED THIS FRIGHTFUL SITUATION WHICH HAD ALREADY LASTED ABOVE HALF AN HOUR WAS CHANGING ITS ASPECT EVERY MOMENT
CORONEL STOPPED YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS'S COMMANDS HE BEGAN RATHER COLDLY THERE WAS AN OMINOUS SNIFFING FROM THE BUSHES CORONEL SAID AN UNHAPPY VOICE AT LAST
HOWEVER WE'LL SOON GET HIM ALL RIGHT THAT EVENING HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE COTTAGE HAD STOOD BUT IT WAS GONE NEXT MORNING HE RODE BACK TO THE WOOD UDO WAS GONE TOO
SO THEY HELD A COUNCIL OF WAR PRINCE UDO PUT FORWARD TWO SUGGESTIONS THE FIRST WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK ON THE MORROW AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN THE SECOND
OF LONDON TREATED HER PROPERLY AND SHE RECOVERED SHE WAS THE RIB OF A MAN WHO COMMANDED A VESSEL BELONGING TO HELVOETSLUYS HE WAS JUST GOING OUT OF PORT ON A VOYAGE WHEN SHE HEARING HE HAD GOT A MISTRESS WITH HIM
THEY WILL BOTH ENTER THE CARRIAGE WITH MY COMRADE BEHIND SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE THE BARRIER THERE IS A TRAP HARNESSED TO TWO VERY GOOD HORSES YOUR YOUNG LADY WILL BE TAKEN TO IT SHE WILL ALIGHT FROM THE FIACRE
IN THIS BOX HE HIDES A WATCH SPRING AND THIS WATCH SPRING PROPERLY HANDLED CUTS GOOD SIZED CHAINS AND BARS OF IRON THE UNFORTUNATE CONVICT IS SUPPOSED TO POSSESS MERELY A SOU NOT AT ALL
MY COMRADE WILL ENTER THE OTHER VEHICLE WITH HER AND MY WIFE WILL COME BACK HERE TO TELL US IT'S DONE AS FOR THE YOUNG LADY NO HARM WILL BE DONE TO HER
REALLY FRANKLY HE ASKED
SHE PAUSED CHOKING THEN WENT ON
CORONEL DECIDED THAT IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR TACT AH HERE YOU ARE HE SAID CHEERFULLY SHALL WE GET ALONG DON'T BE A FOOL CORONEL SAID UDO ALMOST CRYING
I'M TELLING YOU HOW THINGS STAND I WARN YOU SO THAT YOU MAY BE PREPARED HE PAUSED THE PRISONER DID NOT BREAK THE SILENCE AND THENARDIER RESUMED
SOFTLY DETACHED A BIT OF PLASTER FROM THE WALL WRAPPED THE PAPER ROUND IT AND TOSSED THE WHOLE THROUGH THE CREVICE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DEN IT WAS HIGH TIME THENARDIER HAD CONQUERED HIS LAST FEARS OR HIS LAST SCRUPLES
HE MIGHT GO BACK TO ARABY
HE FOUND THIS GENTLE CREATURE WAITING HIS ARRIVAL AND LEARNED THE MEANS BY WHICH SHE CAME INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT SWUNG HIS RIGHT FOOT WHICH HUNG DOWN AND STARED AT THE BRAZIER WITH AN AIR OF SAVAGE REVERY
AS SHE SANK SHE FELL UPON HER SIDE AND FORCED A VERY LARGE LOBSTER TREE OUT OF ITS PLACE IT WAS IN THE SPRING WHEN THE LOBSTERS WERE VERY YOUNG
MARIUS HAD SUFFICIENT STRENGTH OF MIND TO REVIEW IN SUCCESSION ALL THE MOST HEART BREAKING CONJECTURES SEEKING HOPE AND FINDING NONE
STRIKING I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU SEE TO ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
SHE WOULD FIND THAT INSPIRING
HE POSSESSES LIBERTY IT WAS A LARGE SOU OF THIS SORT
THIS IS A PAINFUL CHAPTER FOR ME TO WRITE MERCIFULLY IT IS TO BE A SHORT ONE LATER ON I SHALL BECOME USED TO THE SITUATION INCLINED EVEN TO DWELL UPON ITS HUMOROUS SIDE
NOT ONLY ABLE BUT REALLY WISHED TO DEVOUR US NOW AS MY ROSINANTE WAS BLIND I HAD THESE HUNGRY GENTLEMEN'S ATTEMPTS TO GUARD AGAINST IN ADDITION TO MY OTHER DIFFICULTIES
STARED AT HIM IN STUPEFACTION AS ALMOST FREE AND IN A FORMIDABLE ATTITUDE HE BRANDISHED ABOVE HIS HEAD THE RED HOT CHISEL WHICH EMITTED A THREATENING GLOW
WHEN I CAME CLOSE I PERCEIVED HER HAND MOVE I TOOK IT INTO MINE AND BROUGHT HER ON SHORE AS A CORPSE AN APOTHECARY WHO HAD JUST BEEN INSTRUCTED BY DOCTOR HAWES
AND MANY OF THEM BEING SEPARATED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE SHOCK THEY FELL UPON A CRAB TREE WHICH WAS GROWING BELOW THEM THEY HAVE LIKE THE FARINA OF PLANTS UNITED AND PRODUCED A FISH RESEMBLING BOTH
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT HE WAS SAVE THAT THERE WAS AN IMPRESSION OF MAGNIFICENCE ABOUT HIS PERSON SUCH MAGNIFICENCE ANYHOW AS IS GIVEN BY AN ASTRAKHAN TRIMMED FUR COAT
A WOMAN'S LIFE SAVED THE CAUSE OF HER FALLING INTO THE SEA
WHAT THAT YOUNG GIRL WHOM THEY WERE ABDUCTING WAS NOT TO BE BROUGHT BACK ONE OF THOSE MONSTERS WAS TO BEAR HER OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WHITHER AND WHAT IF IT WERE SHE IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS SHE
OPENED THE DRAWER AND TOOK OUT THE KNIFE MARIUS FRETTED WITH THE HANDLE OF HIS PISTOL UNPRECEDENTED PERPLEXITY FOR THE LAST HOUR HE HAD HAD TWO VOICES IN HIS CONSCIENCE
HE SAT UP SUDDENLY AND STARED AT CORONEL IT WAS THAT OLD WOMAN DID IT YOU MARK MY WORDS CORONEL SHE DID IT WHY SHOULD SHE
AT THE SAME MOMENT HE EXTENDED HIS ARM AND LAID THE GLOWING CHISEL WHICH HE HELD IN HIS LEFT HAND BY ITS WOODEN HANDLE
ROGER SCURVILEGS FRANKLY BREAKS DOWN OVER IT THAT ABOMINABLE WOMAN HE SAYS MEANING OF COURSE BELVANE AND HE HAS HYSTERICS FOR MORE THAN A PAGE LET US DESCRIBE IT CALMLY
REPLIED THENARDIER SINCE PONINE HAS THROWN THE STONE THROUGH THE WINDOW IT INDICATES THAT THE HOUSE IS NOT WATCHED ON THAT SIDE THE MASK WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE DEPOSITED HIS HUGE KEY ON THE FLOOR
REALLY I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS BECAUSE I'M TOO UNIMPORTANT YES THAT MUST BE IT HE BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE BRIGHTER OBVIOUSLY THAT'S IT HE CARESSED A WHISKER WITH ONE OF HIS PAWS
THE PRISONER UTTERED NOT A SYLLABLE AFTER A PAUSE THENARDIER CONTINUED IT'S VERY SIMPLE AS YOU SEE THERE'LL BE NO HARM DONE UNLESS YOU WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE HARM DONE
UNTAMABLE IN THE MAN THEY LOVE WELL THERE IT WAS IT WAS NOT AS IF HE HAD CORONEL WITH HIM CORONEL AND HE IN HIS PRESENT HEALTH COULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO EURALIA TOGETHER
THE HORRIBLE GLOWING TOOL DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT WHIRLING AS IT FLEW AND FELL FAR AWAY ON THE SNOW THE PRISONER RESUMED DO WHAT YOU PLEASE WITH ME HE WAS DISARMED
THENARDIER EXCLAIMED ARE YOU MAD ARE YOU CRAZY WHAT A PACK OF BOOBIES YOU WANT TO WASTE TIME DO YOU DRAW LOTS DO YOU BY A WET FINGER BY A SHORT STRAW
THE ONE ENJOINING HIM TO RESPECT HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT THE OTHER CRYING TO HIM TO RESCUE THE PRISONER THESE TWO VOICES CONTINUED UNINTERRUPTEDLY THAT STRUGGLE WHICH TORMENTED HIM TO AGONY UP TO THAT MOMENT
THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME HE BEGAN TO LOOK SO MUCH HAPPIER THAT CORONEL THOUGHT IT WAS A FAVOURABLE MOMENT IN WHICH TO WITHDRAW SHALL I GO NOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO CUT HIS THROAT THAT'S IT IT WAS THE HUSBAND AND WIFE TAKING COUNSEL TOGETHER THENARDIER WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE TABLE
ARE SAID TO BE UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED FATHOMS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA ON THE SIDES OF WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT VARIETY OF TALL NOBLE TREES LOADED WITH MARINE FRUIT SUCH AS LOBSTERS CRABS OYSTERS SCOLLOPS
SHE WOULD FIND HIM STROKABLE AND THE LION IN HIM
THE REVOLTS OF THE FLESH AND THE SENSES WHEN SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL SUFFERING CAUSE THE SOUL TO SPRING FORTH AND MAKE IT APPEAR ON THE BROW JUST AS REBELLIONS AMONG THE SOLDIERY FORCE THE CAPTAIN TO SHOW HIMSELF
HE ADDED BITTERLY HOW DID IT HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW CORONEL I JUST WENT TO SLEEP
AND AFTER ALL THAT RACING AND FEE TO THE COACHMAN AND ALL I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PORTER AND THE PORTRESS A FINE STOUT WOMAN AND THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM MARIUS BREATHED FREELY ONCE MORE
THIS WAS WHAT MARIUS PERCEIVED MOST CLEARLY OF ALL A SORT OF HORRIBLE FASCINATION HELD HIM NAILED TO HIS POST FROM WHICH HE WAS OBSERVING AND COMMANDING THIS WHOLE SCENE THERE HE STOOD
ARE TO JEWELLERS WORK WHAT THE METAPHORS OF SLANG ARE TO POETRY THERE ARE BENVENUTO CELLINIS IN THE GALLEYS
ALREADY THEN HE HAD SUFFERED IN HER SERVICE SO AT LEAST HE WOULD SAY AND SO POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE CORONEL HAD THOUGHT HIM FUNNY BUT WOMEN HAD NOT MUCH SENSE OF HUMOUR AS A RULE
RABBIT HE SOBBED SO UNDIGNIFIED
AND WHERE HE KEEPS HIS SHINERS THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE MANAGED MATTERS PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY THAT MEN ARE A DEAL STUPIDER THAN WOMEN
WHAT WAS HE TO DO DISCHARGE THE PISTOL PLACE ALL THOSE SCOUNDRELS IN THE HANDS OF JUSTICE BUT THE HORRIBLE MAN WITH THE MEAT AXE WOULD NONE THE LESS BE OUT OF REACH WITH THE YOUNG GIRL
IT'S NOTHING BUT A BIG CARRIAGE GATE
AND WHERE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH ONE MAY COME TO LOVE
THIS WAS THE EXPEDIENT OF WHICH HE WAS IN SEARCH THE SOLUTION OF THAT FRIGHTFUL PROBLEM WHICH WAS TORTURING HIM OF SPARING THE ASSASSIN AND SAVING THE VICTIM HE KNELT DOWN ON HIS COMMODE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARM SEIZED THE SHEET OF PAPER
I WILL NOW FAITHFULLY GIVE YOU IN HIS OWN WORDS AS I HEARD HIM RELATE THEM TO HIS FRIENDS SEVERAL TIMES ON MY ARRIVAL SAYS MY FATHER AT HELVOETSLUYS I WAS OBSERVED TO BREATHE WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
AS HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BEND DOWN FOR FEAR OF BETRAYING HIMSELF HE HAD NOT CUT THE BONDS OF HIS LEFT LEG THE RUFFIANS HAD RECOVERED FROM THEIR FIRST SURPRISE BE EASY
FALSE ADDRESS THE RUFFIAN WHO HAD GONE WITH HER MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEHIND HER AND PICKED UP HIS AXE AGAIN SHE RESUMED NOBODY THERE
CORONEL GOT ON HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF EARSHOT HE BEGAN TO LAUGH SPASM AFTER SPASM SHOOK HIM NO SOONER HAD HE COMPOSED HIMSELF TO GRAVITY
IT WAS LIKELY THAT SHE ALONE COULD TURN HIM BACK AGAIN AND THAT IN THAT CASE HE HAD BETTER ONLY THREATEN HER I WANT SOMEBODY KILLED SAID UDO RATHER NATURALLY SUPPOSE SAID CORONEL
READY TO SMASH HIS SKULL AT THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT AT THE SAME TIME MARIUS HEARD BELOW HIM AT THE BASE OF THE PARTITION BUT SO NEAR THAT HE COULD NOT SEE WHO WAS SPEAKING THIS COLLOQUY CONDUCTED IN A LOW TONE
SHE HANDED IT TO HER HUSBAND WHERE DID THIS COME FROM DEMANDED THENARDIER PARDIE EJACULATED HIS WIFE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE IT CAME FROM THROUGH THE WINDOW OF COURSE
WHY NOT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD CALLED FOR HIM WHAT DEVOTION IT SHOWED IF HE CAME TO HER EVEN NOW IN HIS PRESENT STATE OF BAD HEALTH SHE WAS IN TROUBLE
TO HOLLOW OUT THESE PLATES WITHOUT AFFECTING THE COINAGE STAMP AND TO MAKE A FURROW ON THE EDGE OF THE SOU IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE PLATES WILL ADHERE AGAIN THIS CAN BE SCREWED TOGETHER AND UNSCREWED AT WILL IT IS A BOX
THE PRISONER WAS ONLY ATTACHED TO THE BED NOW BY ONE LEG BEFORE THE SEVEN MEN HAD TIME TO COLLECT THEIR SENSES AND DASH FORWARD HE HAD BENT DOWN INTO THE FIREPLACE HAD STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO THE BRAZIER
BUT FOR THE MOMENT I CANNOT SEE BEYOND THE SADNESS OF IT THAT TO A PRINCE OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF ARABY
BUT NO DOUBT HE WOULD THINK OF SOME TREMENDOUSLY CUNNING DEVICE LATER ON TO EURALIA THEN WITH ALL DISPATCH HE TROTTED OFF
THEREFORE I HAD NO INCLINATION TO PROLONG THE TIME ADD TO THIS MY SITUATION WAS IN OTHER RESPECTS VERY UNPLEASANT I MET MANY LARGE FISH WHO WERE IF I COULD JUDGE BY THEIR OPEN MOUTHS
HE SAID ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE STARTING WE AREN'T STARTING SAID THE VOICE WHAT'S THE MATTER WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THE BUSHES FOR WHATEVER'S THE MATTER UDO
THE PERIWINKLE IS A KIND OF SHRUB IT GROWS AT THE FOOT OF THE OYSTER TREE AND TWINES ROUND IT AS THE IVY DOES THE OAK
HE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND BEGAN TO THINK IT OUT LEFT TO HIMSELF UDO VERY SOON MADE UP HIS MIND THERE WERE THREE COURSES OPEN TO HIM HE MIGHT STAY WHERE HE WAS TILL HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
I OMITTED SEVERAL VERY MATERIAL PARTS IN MY FATHER'S JOURNEY ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL TO HOLLAND WHICH THAT THEY MAY NOT BE TOTALLY LOST
THENARDIER RAPIDLY UNFOLDED THE PAPER AND HELD IT CLOSE TO THE CANDLE IT'S IN EPONINE'S HANDWRITING THE DEVIL HE MADE A SIGN TO HIS WIFE WHO HASTILY DREW NEAR
MARIUS CAST A WILD GLANCE ABOUT HIM THE LAST MECHANICAL RESOURCE OF DESPAIR ALL AT ONCE A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH HIM AT HIS FEET ON THE TABLE A BRIGHT RAY OF LIGHT FROM THE FULL MOON
AS SOON AS MY WIFE RETURNS AND SAYS TO ME THE LARK IS ON THE WAY WE WILL RELEASE YOU AND YOU WILL BE FREE TO GO AND SLEEP AT HOME YOU SEE THAT OUR INTENTIONS ARE NOT EVIL
SO POPULAR TO ARABY WHERE HE RODE DAILY AMONG HIS FATHER'S SUBJECTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CHEERING HIM HOW AWKWARD FOR EVERYBODY ON TO EURALIA THEN
WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK THAT AFTERNOON AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN CORONEL POINTED OUT THAT AS SHE HAD TURNED PRINCE UDO INTO INTO A A QUITE SO SAID UDO
AND HAD THEN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AGAIN AND NOW THENARDIER THE FEMALE THENARDIER AND THE RUFFIANS HUDDLED IN AMAZEMENT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE HOVEL
SEIZE HIM SAID THENARDIER TWO OF THE RUFFIANS LAID THEIR HANDS ON HIS SHOULDER AND THE MASKED MAN WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE TOOK UP HIS STATION IN FRONT OF HIM
CORONEL CAME BACK FROM HIS STROLL IN THE SAME CASUAL WAY IN WHICH HE HAD STARTED
WELL THINK OF THAT UDO SHOWED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF IT BY WAVING IT PEEVISHLY THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR TACT HE SAID TELL ME WHAT I LOOK LIKE CORONEL CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT
HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY
I WAS AFRAID SO HE SAID THAT'S THE CRUEL PART ABOUT IT HAD I BEEN A LION THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CERTAIN PATHETIC SPLENDOUR ABOUT MY POSITION ISOLATED CUT OFF SUFFERING IN REGAL SILENCE
YOU ARE TOO GOOD YOU SEE IF IT HAD BEEN ME I'D HAVE CHOPPED THE BEAST IN FOUR QUARTERS TO BEGIN WITH AND IF HE HAD ACTED UGLY I'D HAVE BOILED HIM ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEAK AND SAY WHERE THE GIRL IS
SAID UDO NERVOUSLY THEN FRANKLY YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS LOOKS FUNNY VERY FUNNY SAID UDO WISTFULLY VERY FUNNY SAID CORONEL HIS HIGHNESS SIGHED
GOOD BYE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE THE DOOR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE WAS HEARD TO OPEN AND SHUT AGAIN THE PRISONER MADE A MOVEMENT IN HIS BONDS HERE'S THE BOURGEOISE SAID THENARDIER
WAS SAFE WHILE HIS EXASPERATED WIFE VOCIFERATED
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO GAIN BY THAT TO GAIN TIME CRIED THE PRISONER IN A THUNDERING VOICE AND AT THE SAME INSTANT HE SHOOK OFF HIS BONDS THEY WERE CUT
THE UNHAPPY WRETCH WHO ASPIRES TO DELIVERANCE FINDS MEANS SOMETIMES WITHOUT TOOLS SOMETIMES WITH A COMMON WOODEN HANDLED KNIFE TO SAW A SOU INTO TWO THIN PLATES
AND IT WAS MY UNFORTUNATE LOT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR BRINGING THIS HAPPY PAIR TOGETHER AGAIN I CAN EASILY CONCEIVE WHAT EXECRATIONS THE HUSBAND LOADED ME WITH WHEN ON HIS RETURN
WITH WRITTEN NAMES THROWN INTO A HAT WOULD YOU LIKE MY HAT CRIED A VOICE ON THE THRESHOLD
FINALLY HE SAID TO THE PRISONER WITH A SLOW AND SINGULARLY FEROCIOUS TONE
BESIDES I WAS THEN THOUGH GALLOPING OVER A MOUNTAIN OF ROCKS THAT LAY ABOUT MIDWAY THE PASSAGE AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED FATHOM BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND BEGAN TO FIND THE WANT OF AIR INCONVENIENT
HE WAS NOT THINKING OF UDO HE WAS WONDERING IF PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD AN ATTENDANT OF SURPASSING BEAUTY OR A DRAGON OF SURPASSING MALEVOLENCE IF IN FACT
I WAS VERY POLITE TO HER DON'T YOU REMEMBER MY SAYING TO YOU BE POLITE TO HER BECAUSE SHE'S PROBABLY A FAIRY
WHEN THE POLICE MADE THEIR DESCENT ON IT THIS SOU PIECE WAS ONE OF THOSE MARVELS OF INDUSTRY WHICH ARE ENGENDERED BY THE PATIENCE OF THE GALLEYS IN THE SHADOWS AND FOR THE SHADOWS MARVELS WHICH ARE NOTHING ELSE THAN INSTRUMENTS OF ESCAPE
I THINK I'M COMING OUT WONDERING WHAT IT ALL MEANT CORONEL WAITED IN SILENCE YES I AM COMING OUT CORONEL SAID THE VOICE BUT YOU MUSTN'T BE SURPRISED IF I DON'T LOOK VERY WELL
AND THEN I WILL GIVE MY LIFE AND MY BLOOD IF NECESSARY BUT I WILL DELIVER HER NOTHING SHALL STOP ME NEARLY HALF AN HOUR PASSED IN THIS MANNER THENARDIER SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN GLOOMY REFLECTIONS
FRUIT SHOOK OFF THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE IT GROWS UPON BY THE MOTION OF THE WATER AS THOSE IN OUR GARDENS ARE BY THAT OF THE WIND THE LOBSTER TREES APPEARED THE RICHEST BUT THE CRAB AND OYSTERS WERE THE TALLEST
I'M I'M CORONEL HERE I AM SAID UDO PATHETICALLY
THAN A REMEMBRANCE OF UDO'S APPEARANCE STARTED HIM OFF AGAIN I COULDN'T HAVE STAYED WITH HIM A MOMENT LONGER HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BURST
I SAW ONE ONCE IN BARODIA IT IS NOT A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL CORONEL BUT AS A YAK I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNLOVABLE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH AT A YAK CORONEL
THE PRISONER DID NOT STIR STILL MARIUS FANCIED THAT AT INTERVALS AND FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HE HAD HEARD A FAINT DULL NOISE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISONER ALL AT ONCE THENARDIER ADDRESSED THE PRISONER
AS WE DREW NEAR THE DUTCH SHORE AND THE BODY OF WATER OVER OUR HEADS DID NOT EXCEED TWENTY FATHOMS I THOUGHT I SAW A HUMAN FIGURE IN A FEMALE DRESS THEN LYING ON THE SAND BEFORE ME WITH SOME SIGNS OF LIFE
AND JUST AS SOON AS YOU HAVE HANDED OVER TO ME THOSE LITTLE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS SHE WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU IF YOU HAVE ME ARRESTED MY COMRADE WILL GIVE A TURN OF HIS THUMB TO THE LARK THAT'S ALL
HE WAVED AN EXPLANATORY PAW EVEN IN THE MOST HIDEOUS OF BEASTS THERE MIGHT BE A DIGNITY HE MEDITATED FOR A MOMENT HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A YAK CORONEL HE ASKED NEVER
THE ENIGMA WAS MORE IMPENETRABLE THAN EVER WHO WAS THIS LITTLE ONE WHOM THENARDIER HAD CALLED THE LARK WAS SHE HIS URSULE THE PRISONER HAD NOT SEEMED TO BE AFFECTED BY THAT WORD THE LARK
THEY ALSO FOUND A TINY SAW OF BLUE STEEL WHICH WOULD FIT THE SOU IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRISONER HAD THIS SOU PIECE ON HIS PERSON AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE RUFFIANS SEARCHED HIM THAT HE CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IT IN HIS HAND
ASKED THE THENARDIER WOMAN WE HAVEN'T THE TIME THROUGH WHAT
FOLLOWED HIM IN AN OPEN BOAT AS SOON AS SHE HAD GOT ON THE QUARTER DECK SHE FLEW AT HER HUSBAND AND ATTEMPTED TO STRIKE HIM WITH SUCH IMPETUOSITY THAT HE THOUGHT IT MOST PRUDENT TO SLIP ON ONE SIDE
THIS HE REJECTED AT ONCE WHEN YOU HAVE THE HEAD OF A RABBIT THE TAIL OF A LION AND THE MIDDLE OF A WOOLLY LAMB THE NEED FOR ACTION OF SOME KIND IS IMPERATIVE
THINK THAT THE LARK REALLY IS YOUR DAUGHTER
AND MAKE HER TELL ME WHAT SHE KNOWS SHE KNOWS SOMETHING I'M CERTAIN THEN WE SHALL SEE BETTER WHAT TO DO UDO MUSED FOR A SPACE WHY DIDN'T THEY TURN YOU INTO ANYTHING HE ASKED
AND HE LED THE WAY TO IT ACROSS A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARK THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN THIS GARDEN WAS SUCH AS CATHERINE COULD NOT LISTEN TO WITHOUT DISMAY BEING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXTENT OF ALL MISTER ALLEN'S AS WELL AS HER FATHER'S INCLUDING CHURCH YARD AND ORCHARD
THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING AND A TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING HAS MY SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL
I COULD HAVE ANSWERED FOR MY COURAGE BUT NOW TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING TO ALARM ONE SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM THE WINDOW CURTAINS SEEMED IN MOTION
TO CLOSE HER EYES IN SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE FELT MUST BE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION WITH A CURIOSITY SO JUSTLY AWAKENED AND FEELINGS IN EVERY WAY SO AGITATED REPOSE MUST BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE THE STORM TOO ABROAD SO DREADFUL
AND HAD SEEN ONLY A FEW OF ITS ROOMS THE NETTING BOX JUST LEISURELY DRAWN FORTH WAS CLOSED WITH JOYFUL HASTE AND SHE WAS READY TO ATTEND HIM IN A MOMENT
WITH A TRIUMPHANT SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION THE GENERAL WISHED HE COULD DO THE SAME
A LAMP COULD NOT HAVE EXPIRED WITH MORE AWFUL EFFECT CATHERINE FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS MOTIONLESS WITH HORROR IT WAS DONE COMPLETELY NOT A REMNANT OF LIGHT IN THE WICK COULD GIVE HOPE TO THE REKINDLING BREATH DARKNESS IMPENETRABLE AND IMMOVABLE FILLED THE ROOM
AND THE STEEP WOODY HILLS RISING BEHIND TO GIVE IT SHELTER WERE BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN THE LEAFLESS MONTH OF MARCH CATHERINE HAD SEEN NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT AND HER FEELINGS OF DELIGHT WERE SO STRONG THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY BETTER AUTHORITY SHE BOLDLY BURST FORTH IN WONDER AND PRAISE
THE WIND HAD BEEN RISING AT INTERVALS THE WHOLE AFTERNOON AND BY THE TIME THE PARTY BROKE UP IT BLEW AND RAINED VIOLENTLY CATHERINE AS SHE CROSSED THE HALL LISTENED TO THE TEMPEST WITH SENSATIONS OF AWE AND WHEN SHE HEARD IT RAGE ROUND A CORNER OF THE ANCIENT BUILDING AND CLOSE WITH SUDDEN FURY A DISTANT DOOR
SHE WAS ENABLED ESPECIALLY ON PERCEIVING THAT MISS TILNEY SLEPT ONLY TWO DOORS FROM HER TO ENTER HER ROOM WITH A TOLERABLY STOUT HEART AND HER SPIRITS WERE IMMEDIATELY ASSISTED BY THE CHEERFUL BLAZE OF A WOOD FIRE
THE GENERAL'S GOOD HUMOUR INCREASED WHY AS HE HAD SUCH ROOMS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMPLE NOT TO MAKE USE OF THEM
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN ILL SIZED ROOM AND FURTHER CONFESSED THAT THOUGH AS CARELESS ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS MOST PEOPLE HE DID LOOK UPON A TOLERABLY LARGE EATING ROOM AS ONE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE HE SUPPOSED HOWEVER
WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
IMMEDIATELY RUSHED ACROSS HER AND THOUGH THERE COULD BE NOTHING REALLY IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHIMSICAL IT WAS CERTAINLY A VERY REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE SHE TOOK HER CANDLE AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE CABINET IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY EBONY AND GOLD
HE WAS ENCHANTED BY HER APPROBATION OF HIS TASTE CONFESSED IT TO BE NEAT AND SIMPLE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURE OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR HIS PART TO HIS UNCRITICAL PALATE THE TEA WAS AS WELL FLAVOURED FROM THE CLAY OF STAFFORDSHIRE
THE WALLS WERE PAPERED THE FLOOR WAS CARPETED THE WINDOWS WERE NEITHER LESS PERFECT NOR MORE DIM THAN THOSE OF THE DRAWING ROOM BELOW THE FURNITURE THOUGH NOT OF THE LATEST FASHION WAS HANDSOME AND COMFORTABLE AND THE AIR OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER FAR FROM UNCHEERFUL
A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS PRESENT A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT FRIEND
IN COARSE AND MODERN CHARACTERS SEEMED ALL THAT WAS BEFORE HER IF THE EVIDENCE OF SIGHT MIGHT BE TRUSTED SHE HELD A WASHING BILL IN HER HAND SHE SEIZED ANOTHER SHEET AND SAW THE SAME ARTICLES WITH LITTLE VARIATION A THIRD A FOURTH AND A FIFTH PRESENTED NOTHING NEW
AS IF SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED THE FIRE THEREFORE DIED AWAY AND CATHERINE HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED WHEN ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
OR IF HE DID NOT HIS FRIENDS AND CHILDREN DID THERE WERE GREAT VEXATIONS HOWEVER ATTENDING SUCH A GARDEN AS HIS
AND FORCED HER IN SPITE OF HER ANXIOUS DESIRE TO PENETRATE THIS MYSTERY TO PROCEED IN HER DRESSING WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY HER PROGRESS WAS NOT QUICK FOR HER THOUGHTS AND HER EYES WERE STILL BENT ON THE OBJECT SO WELL CALCULATED TO INTEREST AND ALARM AND THOUGH SHE DARED NOT WASTE A MOMENT UPON A SECOND ATTEMPT
A GLANCE AT THE OLD CHEST AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THIS EXAMINATION WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS USE SHE SCORNED THE CAUSELESS FEARS OF AN IDLE FANCY AND BEGAN WITH A MOST HAPPY INDIFFERENCE TO PREPARE HERSELF FOR BED SHE SHOULD TAKE HER TIME SHE SHOULD NOT HURRY HERSELF
BUT IT WAS SO VERY ODD AFTER WHAT HENRY HAD SAID IN SHORT SHE COULD NOT SLEEP TILL SHE HAD EXAMINED IT SO PLACING THE CANDLE WITH GREAT CAUTION ON A CHAIR SHE SEIZED THE KEY WITH A VERY TREMULOUS HAND AND TRIED TO TURN IT BUT IT RESISTED HER UTMOST STRENGTH
HE SUFFERED THE GIRLS AT LAST TO SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF AN OUTER DOOR AND THEN EXPRESSING HIS WISH TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SOME RECENT ALTERATIONS ABOUT THE TEA HOUSE PROPOSED IT AS NO UNPLEASANT EXTENSION OF THEIR WALK IF MISS MORLAND WERE NOT TIRED
BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM MADE HER STARTING QUIT HER HOLD AND THE LID CLOSED WITH ALARMING VIOLENCE THIS ILL TIMED INTRUDER WAS MISS TILNEY'S MAID SENT BY HER MISTRESS TO BE OF USE TO MISS MORLAND AND THOUGH CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED HER
THE WALLS SEEMED COUNTLESS IN NUMBER ENDLESS IN LENGTH A VILLAGE OF HOT HOUSES SEEMED TO ARISE AMONG THEM AND A WHOLE PARISH TO BE AT WORK WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE THE GENERAL WAS FLATTERED BY HER LOOKS OF SURPRISE WHICH TOLD HIM ALMOST AS PLAINLY
IT WAS OF CEDAR CURIOUSLY INLAID WITH SOME DARKER WOOD AND RAISED ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND ON A CARVED STAND OF THE SAME THE LOCK WAS SILVER THOUGH TARNISHED FROM AGE
AND MOST HEARTILY DID SHE REJOICE IN THE HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER ENTRANCE WITHIN WALLS SO SOLEMN SHE HAD NOTHING TO DREAD FROM MIDNIGHT ASSASSINS OR DRUNKEN GALLANTS
TO RETIRE TO BED HOWEVER UNSATISFIED ON SUCH A POINT WOULD BE VAIN SINCE SLEEP MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CABINET SO MYSTERIOUSLY CLOSED IN HER IMMEDIATE VICINITY AGAIN THEREFORE SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO THE KEY
SHE HAD OFTEN READ OF SUCH CHARACTERS CHARACTERS WHICH MISTER ALLEN HAD BEEN USED TO CALL UNNATURAL AND OVERDRAWN BUT HERE WAS PROOF POSITIVE OF THE CONTRARY SHE HAD JUST SETTLED THIS POINT WHEN THE END OF THE PATH BROUGHT THEM DIRECTLY UPON THE GENERAL
MISS TILNEY CONTINUING SILENT SHE VENTURED TO SAY HER DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT AFFLICTION A GREAT AND INCREASING ONE REPLIED THE OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
CATHERINE HAD NO LEISURE FOR SPEECH BEING AT ONCE BLUSHING TYING HER GOWN AND FORMING WISE RESOLUTIONS WITH THE MOST VIOLENT DISPATCH MISS TILNEY GENTLY HINTED HER FEAR OF BEING LATE AND IN HALF A MINUTE THEY RAN DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER IN AN ALARM NOT WHOLLY UNFOUNDED
AND HAVING THROWN OPEN EACH FOLDING DOOR THE SECOND BEING SECURED ONLY BY BOLTS OF LESS WONDERFUL CONSTRUCTION THAN THE LOCK THOUGH IN THAT HER EYE COULD NOT DISCERN ANYTHING UNUSUAL A DOUBLE RANGE OF SMALL DRAWERS APPEARED IN VIEW WITH SOME LARGER DRAWERS ABOVE AND BELOW THEM AND IN THE CENTRE
I THINK IT WOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE MOST IMPARTIAL EYE TO HAVE MANY RECOMMENDATIONS THE HOUSE STANDS AMONG FINE MEADOWS FACING THE SOUTH EAST WITH AN EXCELLENT KITCHEN GARDEN IN THE SAME ASPECT
SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HENRY LEFT THEM FOR WOODSTON WHERE BUSINESS REQUIRED AND WOULD KEEP HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY ALL ATTENDED IN THE HALL TO SEE HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE AND IMMEDIATELY ON RE ENTERING THE BREAKFAST ROOM CATHERINE WALKED TO A WINDOW IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIS FIGURE
AND SHE WAS PREPARING TO UNPIN THE LINEN PACKAGE WHICH THE CHAISE SEAT HAD CONVEYED FOR HER IMMEDIATE ACCOMMODATION WHEN HER EYE SUDDENLY FELL ON A LARGE HIGH CHEST STANDING BACK IN A DEEP RECESS ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE THE SIGHT OF IT MADE HER START
AND FITTED UP IN A STYLE OF LUXURY AND EXPENSE WHICH WAS ALMOST LOST ON THE UNPRACTISED EYE OF CATHERINE WHO SAW LITTLE MORE THAN ITS SPACIOUSNESS AND THE NUMBER OF THEIR ATTENDANTS OF THE FORMER SHE SPOKE ALOUD HER ADMIRATION AND THE GENERAL WITH A VERY GRACIOUS COUNTENANCE
WAS EVERY MOMENT GROWING GREATER AND SEIZING WITH TREMBLING HANDS THE HASP OF THE LOCK SHE RESOLVED AT ALL HAZARDS TO SATISFY HERSELF AT LEAST AS TO ITS CONTENTS WITH DIFFICULTY FOR SOMETHING SEEMED TO RESIST HER EFFORTS SHE RAISED THE LID A FEW INCHES
SHE SEIZED WITH AN UNSTEADY HAND THE PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPT
AS IF BY THE ATTEMPT OF SOMEBODY TO ENTER HOLLOW MURMURS SEEMED TO CREEP ALONG THE GALLERY AND MORE THAN ONCE HER BLOOD WAS CHILLED BY THE SOUND OF DISTANT MOANS
HER FINGERS GRASPED THE HANDLE OF A DRAWER AND DREW IT FORTH IT WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY WITH LESS ALARM AND GREATER EAGERNESS SHE SEIZED A SECOND A THIRD A FOURTH EACH WAS EQUALLY EMPTY NOT ONE WAS LEFT UNSEARCHED
HE YIELDED IMPLICITLY AND WOULD FETCH HIS HAT AND ATTEND THEM IN A MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AND CATHERINE WITH A DISAPPOINTED ANXIOUS FACE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER UNWILLINGNESS THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKING THEM OUT OF DOORS AGAINST HIS OWN INCLINATION UNDER A MISTAKEN IDEA OF PLEASING HER
FOR GENERAL TILNEY WAS PACING THE DRAWING ROOM HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND AND HAVING ON THE VERY INSTANT OF THEIR ENTERING PULLED THE BELL WITH VIOLENCE ORDERED DINNER TO BE ON TABLE DIRECTLY CATHERINE TREMBLED AT THE EMPHASIS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE
HE TRUSTED HOWEVER THAT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ERE LONG OCCUR OF SELECTING ONE THOUGH NOT FOR HIMSELF CATHERINE WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM
AND FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSE SHE STOOD GAZING ON IT IN MOTIONLESS WONDER WHILE THESE THOUGHTS CROSSED HER
AND AFTER MOVING IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY FOR SOME INSTANTS WITH THE DETERMINED CELERITY OF HOPE'S LAST EFFORT THE DOOR SUDDENLY YIELDED TO HER HAND HER HEART LEAPED WITH EXULTATION AT SUCH A VICTORY
IT IS VERY LIKE HERE WAS ANOTHER PROOF A PORTRAIT VERY LIKE OF A DEPARTED WIFE NOT VALUED BY THE HUSBAND HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY CRUEL TO HER
IT WAS ONLY IN HIS PRESENCE THAT CATHERINE FELT THE SMALLEST FATIGUE FROM HER JOURNEY AND EVEN THEN EVEN IN MOMENTS OF LANGUOR OR RESTRAINT A SENSE OF GENERAL HAPPINESS PREPONDERATED AND SHE COULD THINK OF HER FRIENDS IN BATH WITHOUT ONE WISH OF BEING WITH THEM THE NIGHT WAS STORMY
DID HENRY'S INCOME DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS LIVING HE WOULD NOT BE ILL PROVIDED FOR PERHAPS IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT WITH ONLY TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN I SHOULD THINK ANY PROFESSION NECESSARY FOR HIM AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE COULD ALL WISH HIM DISENGAGED FROM EVERY TIE OF BUSINESS
ENTERED THE ROOM AND TO THE RISING SHAME OF HAVING HARBOURED FOR SOME MINUTES AN ABSURD EXPECTATION WAS THEN ADDED THE SHAME OF BEING CAUGHT IN SO IDLE A SEARCH
THE GENERAL PERCEIVED IT AND WITH A CONCERN FOR HER HEALTH WHICH SEEMED TO REPROACH HER FOR HER OPINION OF HIM WAS MOST URGENT FOR RETURNING WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HOUSE HE WOULD FOLLOW THEM IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE HE WAS SURE MUST BE EXACTLY OF THE TRUE SIZE FOR RATIONAL HAPPINESS THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISTURBANCE AND IN THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF GENERAL TILNEY WITH MUCH POSITIVE CHEERFULNESS
WITHOUT ANY AMBITION OF THAT SORT HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT HE DID BELIEVE THEM TO BE UNRIVALLED IN THE KINGDOM IF HE HAD A HOBBY HORSE IT WAS THAT HE LOVED A GARDEN THOUGH CARELESS ENOUGH IN MOST MATTERS OF EATING HE LOVED GOOD FRUIT
SAID MISS TILNEY THAT I ALWAYS THINK IT THE BEST AND NEAREST WAY
AS A MEANS OF GETTING YOU OUT OF DOORS AND TEMPTING YOU TO MORE FREQUENT EXERCISE THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE TAKE AND THOUGH THE LOVE OF A HYACINTH MAY BE RATHER DOMESTIC WHO CAN TELL THE SENTIMENT ONCE RAISED BUT YOU MAY IN TIME COME TO LOVE A ROSE
BY WHAT MEANS COULD IT HAVE BEEN SO LONG CONCEALED AND HOW SINGULARLY STRANGE THAT IT SHOULD FALL TO HER LOT TO DISCOVER IT TILL SHE HAD MADE HERSELF MISTRESS OF ITS CONTENTS HOWEVER SHE COULD HAVE NEITHER REPOSE NOR COMFORT AND WITH THE SUN'S FIRST RAYS SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PERUSE IT
AND SO DESPERATE SHOULD BE THE EXERTION OF HER STRENGTH THAT UNLESS SECURED BY SUPERNATURAL MEANS THE LID IN ONE MOMENT SHOULD BE THROWN BACK WITH THIS SPIRIT SHE SPRANG FORWARD AND HER CONFIDENCE DID NOT DECEIVE HER HER RESOLUTE EFFORT THREW BACK THE LID AND GAVE TO HER ASTONISHED EYES
HER PICTURE I SUPPOSE BLUSHING AT THE CONSUMMATE ART OF HER OWN QUESTION HANGS IN YOUR FATHER'S ROOM NO IT WAS INTENDED FOR THE DRAWING ROOM BUT MY FATHER WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE PAINTING AND FOR SOME TIME IT HAD NO PLACE
BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING ELEANOR WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THAT COLD DAMP PATH TO IT MISS MORLAND WILL GET WET OUR BEST WAY IS ACROSS THE PARK
I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT I DID NOT I COULD NOT THEN KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED WITH GREAT FIRMNESS
FOR HAD NOT THE CABINET APPEARED SO EXACTLY TO AGREE WITH HIS DESCRIPTION OF HER ADVENTURES SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FELT THE SMALLEST CURIOSITY ABOUT IT THIS WAS THE ONLY COMFORT THAT OCCURRED IMPATIENT TO GET RID OF THOSE HATEFUL EVIDENCES OF HER FOLLY THOSE DETESTABLE PAPERS THEN SCATTERED OVER THE BED
AND IN NOT ONE WAS ANYTHING FOUND WELL READ IN THE ART OF CONCEALING A TREASURE THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE LININGS TO THE DRAWERS DID NOT ESCAPE HER AND SHE FELT ROUND EACH WITH ANXIOUS ACUTENESS IN VAIN THE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE ALONE REMAINED NOW UNEXPLORED AND THOUGH SHE HAD
IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ATTENTIONS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXCITED AND WHAT HAD BEEN TERROR AND DISLIKE BEFORE WAS NOW ABSOLUTE AVERSION YES AVERSION HIS CRUELTY TO SUCH A CHARMING WOMAN MADE HIM ODIOUS TO HER
AND IN SPITE OF ALL HER VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAIN OBLIGED TO WALK WITH HIM LISTEN TO HIM AND EVEN TO SMILE WHEN HE SMILED BEING NO LONGER ABLE HOWEVER TO RECEIVE PLEASURE FROM THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS SHE SOON BEGAN TO WALK WITH LASSITUDE
MAMMA SAYS I AM NEVER WITHIN
TO SUPPOSE THAT A MANUSCRIPT OF MANY GENERATIONS BACK COULD HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED IN A ROOM SUCH AS THAT SO MODERN SO HABITABLE
THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN USED TO MUCH BETTER SIZED APARTMENTS AT MISTER ALLEN'S NO INDEED WAS CATHERINE'S HONEST ASSURANCE MISTER ALLEN'S DINING PARLOUR WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF AS LARGE AND SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO LARGE A ROOM AS THIS IN HER LIFE
AS HE SOON FORCED HER TO TELL HIM IN WORDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY GARDENS AT ALL EQUAL TO THEM BEFORE
SHE NOW PLAINLY SAW THAT SHE MUST NOT EXPECT A MANUSCRIPT OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH THE GENERALITY OF WHAT SHE HAD SHUDDERED OVER IN BOOKS FOR THE ROLL SEEMING TO CONSIST ENTIRELY OF SMALL DISJOINTED SHEETS WAS ALTOGETHER BUT OF TRIFLING SIZE
SHE COULD NOT REMAIN MANY PACES FROM THE CHEST AT LENGTH HOWEVER HAVING SLIPPED ONE ARM INTO HER GOWN HER TOILETTE SEEMED SO NEARLY FINISHED THAT THE IMPATIENCE OF HER CURIOSITY MIGHT SAFELY BE INDULGED
BELIEVE THE LAST LETTER TO BE A T AND YET THAT IT SHOULD BE ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT HOUSE WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO RAISE NO COMMON DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT IF NOT ORIGINALLY THEIRS BY WHAT STRANGE EVENTS COULD IT HAVE FALLEN INTO THE TILNEY FAMILY HER FEARFUL CURIOSITY
SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED TO FEEL ALARM FROM WIND BUT NOW EVERY BLAST SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH AWFUL INTELLIGENCE THE MANUSCRIPT SO WONDERFULLY FOUND SO WONDERFULLY ACCOMPLISHING THE MORNING'S PREDICTION HOW WAS IT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT COULD IT CONTAIN
HER HEART INSTANTANEOUSLY AT EASE ON THIS POINT SHE RESOLVED TO LOSE NO TIME IN PARTICULAR EXAMINATION OF ANYTHING AS SHE GREATLY DREADED DISOBLIGING THE GENERAL BY ANY DELAY
AS SO MANY POOR GIRLS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DO AND THEN TO HAVE A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT FRIGHTENING ONE BY COMING IN WITH A FAGGOT HOW GLAD I AM THAT NORTHANGER IS WHAT IT IS IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE SOME OTHER PLACES I DO NOT KNOW THAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
IT WAS A NARROW WINDING PATH THROUGH A THICK GROVE OF OLD SCOTCH FIRS AND CATHERINE STRUCK BY ITS GLOOMY ASPECT AND EAGER TO ENTER IT COULD NOT EVEN BY THE GENERAL'S DISAPPROBATION BE KEPT FROM STEPPING FORWARD
CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD MISSUS TILNEY MENTIONED IN THE FAMILY BEFORE AND THE INTEREST EXCITED BY THIS TENDER REMEMBRANCE SHOWED ITSELF DIRECTLY IN HER ALTERED COUNTENANCE AND IN THE ATTENTIVE PAUSE WITH WHICH SHE WAITED FOR SOMETHING MORE
YES THESE WERE CHARACTERISTIC SOUNDS THEY BROUGHT TO HER RECOLLECTION A COUNTLESS VARIETY OF DREADFUL SITUATIONS AND HORRID SCENES WHICH SUCH BUILDINGS HAD WITNESSED AND SUCH STORMS USHERED IN
THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT
BUT THOUGH I MAY NOT EXACTLY MAKE CONVERTS OF YOU YOUNG LADIES I AM SURE YOUR FATHER MISS MORLAND WOULD AGREE WITH ME IN THINKING IT EXPEDIENT TO GIVE EVERY YOUNG MAN SOME EMPLOYMENT THE MONEY IS NOTHING IT IS NOT AN OBJECT BUT EMPLOYMENT IS THE THING
A SMALL DOOR CLOSED ALSO WITH A LOCK AND KEY SECURED IN ALL PROBABILITY A CAVITY OF IMPORTANCE CATHERINE'S HEART BEAT QUICK BUT HER COURAGE DID NOT FAIL HER WITH A CHEEK FLUSHED BY HOPE AND AN EYE STRAINING WITH CURIOSITY
BY ITS FALLING SHORT OF HIS PLAN HOW WERE MISTER ALLEN'S SUCCESSION HOUSES WORKED DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HIS OWN AS THEY ENTERED THEM MISTER ALLEN HAD ONLY ONE SMALL HOT HOUSE WHICH MISSUS ALLEN HAD THE USE OF FOR HER PLANTS IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN IT NOW AND THEN
SOON AFTER HER DEATH I OBTAINED IT FOR MY OWN AND HUNG IT IN MY BED CHAMBER
OFFERED IT NO INJURY AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK WITH EASY GAIETY OF THE DELIGHTFUL MELANCHOLY WHICH SUCH A GROVE INSPIRED I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF THIS SPOT SAID HER COMPANION WITH A SIGH IT WAS MY MOTHER'S FAVOURITE WALK
SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE APPEARANCE OF A HIGH OLD FASHIONED BLACK CABINET WHICH THOUGH IN A SITUATION CONSPICUOUS ENOUGH HAD NEVER CAUGHT HER NOTICE BEFORE HENRY'S WORDS HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE EBONY CABINET WHICH WAS TO ESCAPE HER OBSERVATION AT FIRST
PUSHED BACK TOO AS IF MEANT TO BE OUT OF SIGHT I WILL LOOK INTO IT COST ME WHAT IT MAY I WILL LOOK INTO IT AND DIRECTLY TOO BY DAYLIGHT IF I STAY TILL EVENING MY CANDLE MAY GO OUT SHE ADVANCED AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY
AND CATHERINE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HOW MUCH HER SPIRITS WERE RELIEVED BY THE SEPARATION
AND MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AT FIRST HER GREEDY EYE GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER A PAGE SHE STARTED AT ITS IMPORT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE OR DID NOT HER SENSES PLAY HER FALSE AN INVENTORY OF LINEN
BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
AND HOW MIGHT YOU LEARN BY ACCIDENT OR ARGUMENT
AND WHILE SHE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH AWFUL SENSATIONS THIS STRIKING EXEMPLIFICATION OF WHAT HENRY HAD FORETOLD RESOLVED INSTANTLY TO PERUSE EVERY LINE BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTED TO REST THE DIMNESS OF THE LIGHT HER CANDLE EMITTED MADE HER TURN TO IT WITH ALARM
WAS SHE A VERY CHARMING WOMAN WAS SHE HANDSOME WAS THERE ANY PICTURE OF HER IN THE ABBEY
FOR SHE COULD NOW MANAGE THEM WITH PERFECT EASE IN THIS THERE WAS SURELY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND SHE INDULGED IN THE FLATTERING SUGGESTION FOR HALF A MINUTE TILL THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DOOR'S HAVING BEEN AT FIRST UNLOCKED
OBSERVED THE GENERAL TO ELEANOR WOODSTON WILL MAKE BUT A SOMBRE APPEARANCE TODAY IS IT A PRETTY PLACE ASKED CATHERINE WHAT SAY YOU ELEANOR SPEAK YOUR OPINION FOR LADIES CAN BEST TELL THE TASTE OF LADIES IN REGARD TO PLACES AS WELL AS MEN
SAID MISS TILNEY AS CATHERINE HASTILY CLOSED IT AND TURNED AWAY TO THE GLASS
ALARMED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED SHE TRIED IT ANOTHER WAY A BOLT FLEW AND SHE BELIEVED HERSELF SUCCESSFUL BUT HOW STRANGELY MYSTERIOUS THE DOOR WAS STILL IMMOVABLE SHE PAUSED A MOMENT IN BREATHLESS WONDER
THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE
NEITHER HER FATHER NOR MISTER ALLEN DID SO IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY PROVOKING
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE A MOMENT'S GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY CATHERINE THAT HER APARTMENT WAS VERY UNLIKE THE ONE WHICH HENRY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ALARM HER BY THE DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS BY NO MEANS UNREASONABLY LARGE AND CONTAINED NEITHER TAPESTRY NOR VELVET
AND THOUGH CATHERINE HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS A PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED
BROKEN PERHAPS PREMATURELY BY SOME STRANGE VIOLENCE AND ON THE CENTRE OF THE LID WAS A MYSTERIOUS CIPHER IN THE SAME METAL CATHERINE BENT OVER IT INTENTLY BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY SHE COULD NOT IN WHATEVER DIRECTION SHE TOOK IT
THE GENERAL LISTENED WITH ASSENTING GRATITUDE AND IT SEEMED AS IF HIS OWN ESTIMATION OF NORTHANGER HAD WAITED UNFIXED TILL THAT HOUR
CATHERINE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW THIS WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHY WAS MISS TILNEY EMBARRASSED COULD THERE BE ANY UNWILLINGNESS ON THE GENERAL'S SIDE TO SHOW HER OVER THE ABBEY THE PROPOSAL WAS HIS OWN
BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY SUCH PURSUIT TO GET ME OUT OF DOORS THE PLEASURE OF WALKING AND BREATHING FRESH AIR IS ENOUGH FOR ME
BUT IT WAS JAPAN BLACK AND YELLOW JAPAN OF THE HANDSOMEST KIND AND AS SHE HELD HER CANDLE THE YELLOW HAD VERY MUCH THE EFFECT OF GOLD THE KEY WAS IN THE DOOR AND SHE HAD A STRANGE FANCY TO LOOK INTO IT NOT HOWEVER WITH THE SMALLEST EXPECTATION OF FINDING ANYTHING
AND SAT PALE AND BREATHLESS IN A MOST HUMBLE MOOD CONCERNED FOR HIS CHILDREN AND DETESTING OLD CHESTS AND THE GENERAL RECOVERING HIS POLITENESS AS HE LOOKED AT HER SPENT THE REST OF HIS TIME IN SCOLDING HIS DAUGHTER FOR SO FOOLISHLY HURRYING HER FAIR FRIEND
TILL THEY WERE HAPPILY SEATED AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN THE GENERAL'S COMPLACENT SMILES AND A GOOD APPETITE OF HER OWN RESTORED HER TO PEACE THE DINING PARLOUR WAS A NOBLE ROOM
THE WALLS SURROUNDING WHICH I BUILT AND STOCKED MYSELF ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY SON IT IS A FAMILY LIVING MISS MORLAND AND THE PROPERTY IN THE PLACE BEING CHIEFLY MY OWN YOU MAY BELIEVE I TAKE CARE THAT IT SHALL NOT BE A BAD ONE
AND YET UNEQUAL TO AN ABSOLUTE FALSEHOOD
A VIOLENT GUST OF WIND RISING WITH SUDDEN FURY ADDED FRESH HORROR TO THE MOMENT CATHERINE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN THE PAUSE WHICH SUCCEEDED A SOUND LIKE RECEDING FOOTSTEPS AND THE CLOSING OF A DISTANT DOOR
HE PERCEIVED HER INCLINATION AND HAVING AGAIN URGED THE PLEA OF HEALTH IN VAIN WAS TOO POLITE TO MAKE FURTHER OPPOSITION HE EXCUSED HIMSELF HOWEVER FROM ATTENDING THEM THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE NOT TOO CHEERFUL FOR HIM AND HE WOULD MEET THEM BY ANOTHER COURSE HE TURNED AWAY
ADDED ELEANOR THOUGH I NEVER LOVED IT THEN AS I HAVE LOVED IT SINCE AT THAT TIME INDEED I USED TO WONDER AT HER CHOICE BUT HER MEMORY ENDEARS IT NOW AND OUGHT IT NOT REFLECTED CATHERINE TO ENDEAR IT TO HER HUSBAND YET THE GENERAL WOULD NOT ENTER IT
INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE RETURNED HER RECOLLECTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND SPRINGING FROM THE BED IN THE VERY MOMENT OF THE MAID'S GOING AWAY SHE EAGERLY COLLECTED EVERY SCATTERED SHEET WHICH HAD BURST FROM THE ROLL ON ITS FALLING TO THE GROUND AND FLEW BACK TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF THEIR PERUSAL ON HER PILLOW
AS SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE LAWN THE WHOLE BUILDING ENCLOSED A LARGE COURT AND TWO SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE RICH IN GOTHIC ORNAMENTS STOOD FORWARD FOR ADMIRATION THE REMAINDER WAS SHUT OFF BY KNOLLS OF OLD TREES OR LUXURIANT PLANTATIONS
SHIRTS STOCKINGS CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH TWO OTHERS PENNED BY THE SAME HAND MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE INTERESTING IN LETTERS HAIR POWDER SHOE STRING AND BREECHES BALL AND THE LARGER SHEET
IF HENRY HAD BEEN WITH THEM INDEED BUT NOW SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT WAS PICTURESQUE WHEN SHE SAW IT SUCH WERE HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF AND PUT ON HER BONNET IN PATIENT DISCONTENT SHE WAS STRUCK HOWEVER BEYOND HER EXPECTATION BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE ABBEY
HER QUICK EYES DIRECTLY FELL ON A ROLL OF PAPER PUSHED BACK INTO THE FURTHER PART OF THE CAVITY APPARENTLY FOR CONCEALMENT AND HER FEELINGS AT THAT MOMENT WERE INDESCRIBABLE HER HEART FLUTTERED HER KNEES TREMBLED AND HER CHEEKS GREW PALE

SHE STOPPED A MOMENT DEAR CLYM I WONDER HOW YOUR FACE LOOKS NOW SHE SAID GAZING ABSTRACTEDLY AT THE PIGEON HOLE
SHE TRIED ONE ASCENDING PATH AND ANOTHER AND FOUND THAT THEY LED HER ASTRAY RETRACING HER STEPS SHE CAME AGAIN TO AN OPEN LEVEL WHERE SHE PERCEIVED AT A DISTANCE A MAN AT WORK
THEIR FATHERS COULDN'T DO IT AND THE COUNTRY WAS ALL THE BETTER FOR IT NOW I SHOULD THINK CAP'N THAT MISS EUSTACIA HAD ABOUT AS MUCH IN HER HEAD THAT COMES FROM BOOKS AS ANYBODY ABOUT HERE
NOW HEARKEN TO ME SHE SAID HER DELICATE VOICE EXPANDING INTO FIRMNESS BY A FORCE WHICH WAS OTHER THAN PHYSICAL TELL HIM NOTHING
SHALL SEEM NO MORE THAN SCROFF IN HIS EYES
WERE WASPS ROLLING DRUNK WITH THE JUICE OR CREEPING ABOUT THE LITTLE CAVES IN EACH FRUIT WHICH THEY HAD EATEN OUT BEFORE STUPEFIED BY ITS SWEETNESS BY THE DOOR LAY CLYM'S FURZE HOOK
SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT QUIETLY FIXING HER EYE UPON HER NIECE
TO SEARCH OUT THE BEST AND LARGEST OF THEM FOR THE COMING HOLIDAY TIME THE LOFT WAS LIGHTED BY A SEMICIRCULAR HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE PIGEONS CREPT TO THEIR LODGINGS IN THE SAME HIGH QUARTERS OF THE PREMISES
IN THAT DAMNED SURGERY OF THE TRIUMPH SEEING MEN BROUGHT DOWN TO THE COCKPIT WITH THEIR LEGS AND ARMS BLOWN TO JERICHO AND SO THE YOUNG MAN HAS SETTLED IN PARIS MANAGER TO A DIAMOND MERCHANT OR SOME SUCH THING IS HE NOT
THEY WERE EVIDENTLY INTENDED FOR FURZE FAGGOT BONDS WHICH HE MEANT TO COLLECT ON HIS RETURN THE SILENT BEING WHO THUS OCCUPIED HIMSELF SEEMED TO BE OF NO MORE ACCOUNT IN LIFE
WHENEVER IT PREVAILED SOME WERE BLASTED AND SPLIT AS IF BY LIGHTNING BLACK STAINS AS FROM FIRE MARKING THEIR SIDES WHILE THE GROUND AT THEIR FEET WAS STREWN WITH DEAD FIR NEEDLES AND HEAPS OF CONES
THAT'S A BAD TROUBLE ABOUT HIS COUSIN THOMASIN
AN OLD IRREGULAR THATCHED HOUSE FACING THE HEATH AND COMMANDING A FULL VIEW OF THE VALLEY THIS WAS THE OBSCURE REMOVED SPOT TO WHICH WAS ABOUT TO RETURN A MAN WHOSE LATTER LIFE
YES POOR MAID HER HEART HAS ACHED ENOUGH ABOUT IT HER HEALTH IS SUFFERING FROM IT I HEAR FOR SHE WILL BIDE ENTIRELY INDOORS WE NEVER SEE HER OUT NOW SCAMPERING OVER THE FURZE WITH A FACE AS RED AS A ROSE AS SHE USED TO DO
WILL YOU WALK WITH ME TO MEET HIM THIS EVENING I SHOULD LIKE TO ELSE IT WOULD SEEM AS IF I HAD FORGOTTEN HIM SAID THOMASIN TOSSING OUT A BOUGH NOT THAT THAT WOULD MATTER MUCH
IN A PROFOUND REVERIE HER TOE UNCONSCIOUSLY TAPPING THE DRY TURF WHICH LAY BURNING AT HER FEET
THE EARTH AND EVERY DROP OF WATER THAT WAS TO BE FOUND IN MISSUS YEOBRIGHT'S GARDEN LARGE LEAVED PLANTS OF A TENDER KIND FLAGGED BY TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING RHUBARB BENT DOWNWARD AT ELEVEN
HE'S GOING TO THE SAME PLACE MA'AM SHE FOLLOWED THE FIGURE INDICATED HE APPEARED OF A RUSSET HUE NOT MORE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SCENE AROUND HIM THAN THE GREEN CATERPILLAR FROM THE LEAF IT FEEDS ON
AUNT SHE SAID PRESENTLY I HAVE I THINK A RIGHT TO REFUSE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION YES YOU HAVE
AND FROM THIS HOLE THE SUN SHONE IN A BRIGHT YELLOW PATCH UPON THE FIGURE OF THE MAIDEN AS SHE KNELT AND PLUNGED HER NAKED ARMS INTO THE SOFT BROWN FERN WHICH FROM ITS ABUNDANCE
STRANGE THAT SUCH A PIECE OF IDLING SHOULD HAVE SEEMED AN IMPORTANT ERRAND SHE PUT ON HER BONNET AND LEAVING THE HOUSE DESCENDED THE HILL ON THE SIDE TOWARDS BLOOMS END
AND SET THE SURROUNDING RABBITS CURIOUSLY WATCHING FROM HILLOCKS AT A SAFE DISTANCE THE PERFORMANCE WAS THAT OF BRINGING TOGETHER AND BUILDING INTO A STACK THE FURZE FAGGOTS
AMID WHICH THE MAGGOTY SHAPES OF INNUMERABLE OBSCURE CREATURES COULD BE INDISTINCTLY SEEN HEAVING AND WALLOWING WITH ENJOYMENT BEING A WOMAN NOT DISINCLINED TO PHILOSOPHIZE
ENTER HIS OWN DOOR AT ONE SIDE OF CLYM'S HOUSE WAS A KNOLL AND ON THE TOP OF THE KNOLL A CLUMP OF FIR TREES SO HIGHLY THRUST UP INTO THE SKY THAT THEIR FOLIAGE FROM A DISTANCE APPEARED
NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME BETTER THAN TO SEE THEM TWO MAN AND WIFE THEY'D LOOK VERY NATTY ARM IN CROOK TOGETHER AND THEIR BEST CLOTHES ON WHETHER OR NO
ALL THAT AFTERNOON THE EXPECTED ARRIVAL OF THE SUBJECT OF EUSTACIA'S RUMINATIONS CREATED A BUSTLE OF PREPARATION AT BLOOMS END THOMASIN HAD BEEN PERSUADED BY HER AUNT
ON ANY INFINITESIMAL MATTER WHICH CAUGHT HER EYES MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN TO HER SON'S HOUSE AND ITS EXACT POSITION WAS UNKNOWN TO HER
THE FURZE STACK WAS NOT FAR FROM THE CHIMNEY AND THE VOICES WERE THOSE OF THE WORKERS HER GRANDFATHER JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION
MORE SINGULAR STILL THE HEATHMEN HAD INSTINCTIVELY COUPLED HER AND THIS MAN TOGETHER IN THEIR MINDS AS A PAIR BORN FOR EACH OTHER
YOU MAY THINK WHAT YOU CHOOSE I HAVE NEVER IMPLIED TO YOU BY WORD OR DEED THAT I HAVE GROWN TO THINK OTHERWISE OF HIM AND I NEVER WILL AND I SHALL MARRY HIM WELL WAIT TILL HE REPEATS HIS OFFER
THOMASIN CAME DOWN WHEN THE APPLES WERE COLLECTED AND TOGETHER THEY WENT THROUGH THE WHITE PALINGS TO THE HEATH BEYOND THE OPEN HILLS WERE AIRY AND CLEAR AND THE REMOTE ATMOSPHERE APPEARED
THE FURZE CUTTER WAS SO ABSORBED IN THE BUSINESS OF HIS JOURNEY THAT HE NEVER TURNED HIS HEAD AND HIS LEATHER LEGGED AND GAUNTLETED FORM AT LENGTH BECAME TO HER AS NOTHING MORE THAN A MOVING HANDPOST TO SHOW HER THE WAY
AS TO GET HOME AGAIN SO SHE WENT ON THE AIR AROUND HER PULSATING SILENTLY AND OPPRESSING THE EARTH WITH LASSITUDE SHE LOOKED AT THE SKY OVERHEAD
AND EVEN STIFF CABBAGES WERE LIMP BY NOON IT WAS ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ON THIS DAY THAT MISSUS YEOBRIGHT STARTED ACROSS THE HEATH TOWARDS HER SON'S HOUSE TO DO HER BEST IN GETTING RECONCILED WITH HIM AND EUSTACIA
BUT THE PRESENT TORRID ATTACK MADE THE JOURNEY A HEAVY UNDERTAKING FOR A WOMAN PAST MIDDLE AGE AND AT THE END OF THE THIRD MILE SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD HIRED FAIRWAY TO DRIVE HER A PORTION AT LEAST OF THE DISTANCE
AND NOT THAT OF A PERSON COME ON BUSINESS OR BY INVITATION HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE WITH INTEREST AND THEN WALKED ROUND AND SCANNED THE OUTER BOUNDARY OF THE GARDEN AS ONE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD IT BEEN THE BIRTHPLACE OF SHAKESPEARE
WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CHAP TERRIBLE MUCH AFTER SO MANY YEARS
CLYM'S FAMILY IS AS GOOD AS HERS
I CAN WELL MIND WHEN HE LEFT HOME SAID SAM TIS A GOOD THING FOR THE FELLER SAID HUMPHREY
A STRATUM OF ENSAFFRONED LIGHT WAS IMPOSED ON A STRATUM OF DEEP BLUE AND BEHIND THESE LAY STILL REMOTER SCENES WRAPPED IN FRIGID GREY
STRANGERS DON'T SEE YOU AS I DO SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT THEY JUDGE FROM FALSE REPORT WELL IT IS A SILLY JOB AND I AM PARTLY TO BLAME HOW QUICKLY A RASH THING CAN BE DONE
WAS USED ON EGDON IN PACKING AWAY STORES OF ALL KINDS THE PIGEONS WERE FLYING ABOUT HER HEAD WITH THE GREATEST UNCONCERN AND THE FACE OF HER AUNT WAS JUST VISIBLE ABOVE THE FLOOR OF THE LOFT
ON ITS WAY TO THE SQUARE BIT OF SKY AT THE TOP FROM WHICH THE DAYLIGHT STRUCK DOWN WITH A PALLID GLARE UPON THE TATTERS OF SOOT DRAPING THE FLUE AS SEAWEED DRAPES A ROCKY FISSURE SHE REMEMBERED
ONLY AT ODD TIMES BY WAY OF USEFUL PASTIME YET SHE NOW BEHELD HIM AS A FURZE CUTTER AND NOTHING MORE WEARING THE REGULATION DRESS OF THE CRAFT
IN CONFORMITY WITH HER WORDS TO THE REDDLEMAN SHE HAD HOPED TO BE WELL ADVANCED IN HER WALK BEFORE THE HEAT OF THE DAY WAS AT ITS HIGHEST BUT AFTER SETTING OUT SHE FOUND THAT THIS WAS NOT TO BE DONE
TILL THEY WERE DIMINISHED TO AN ISOLATED ONE HERE AND THERE BY THE INCREASING FERTILITY OF THE SOIL
WHEN CRACKS APPEARED IN CLAYEY GARDENS AND WERE CALLED EARTHQUAKES BY APPREHENSIVE CHILDREN WHEN LOOSE SPOKES WERE DISCOVERED IN THE WHEELS OF CARTS AND CARRIAGES AND WHEN STINGING INSECTS HAUNTED THE AIR
AND SHE DETERMINED THAT HER WALK SHOULD BE IN THE DIRECTION OF BLOOMS END THE BIRTHPLACE OF YOUNG YEOBRIGHT AND THE PRESENT HOME OF HIS MOTHER SHE HAD NO REASON FOR WALKING ELSEWHERE AND
AND BY AN INSTINCTIVE IMPULSE OF LOYALTY TOWARDS HER COUSIN CLYM TO BESTIR HERSELF ON HIS ACCOUNT WITH AN ALACRITY UNUSUAL IN HER DURING THESE MOST SORROWFUL DAYS OF HER LIFE
HIS PROGRESS WHEN ACTUALLY WALKING WAS MORE RAPID THAN MISSUS YEOBRIGHT'S BUT SHE WAS ENABLED TO KEEP AT AN EQUABLE DISTANCE FROM HIM BY HIS HABIT OF STOPPING WHENEVER HE CAME TO A BRAKE OF BRAMBLES
ANY MORE THAN I AM AN IMPROPER WOMAN HE HAS AN UNFORTUNATE MANNER AND DOESN'T TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE HIM IF THEY DON'T WISH TO DO IT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD THOMASIN
SHE WAS SCARCELY ABLE TO FAMILIARIZE HERSELF WITH THIS STRANGE REALITY SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT CLYM WAS IN THE HABIT OF CUTTING FURZE BUT SHE HAD SUPPOSED THAT HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH THE LABOUR
LIT BY A FEW STRAY MOTES OF LIGHT AS SHE STOOD HALFWAY UP THE LADDER LOOKING AT A SPOT INTO WHICH SHE WAS NOT CLIMBER ENOUGH TO VENTURE NOW A FEW RUSSETS TAMSIN
SHE CAME DOWN THE HILL TO THE GATE AND LOOKED INTO THE HOT GARDEN THERE LAY THE CAT ASLEEP ON THE BARE GRAVEL OF THE PATH AS IF BEDS RUGS AND CARPETS WERE UNENDURABLE
SOME IN THE AIR SOME ON THE HOT GROUND AND VEGETATION SOME IN THE TEPID AND STRINGY WATER OF A NEARLY DRIED POOL ALL THE SHALLOWER PONDS HAD DECREASED TO A VAPOROUS MUD
AS A MOTH FRETS A GARMENT ENTIRELY ENGROSSED WITH ITS PRODUCTS HAVING NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING IN THE WORLD BUT FERN FURZE HEATH LICHENS AND MOSS
THEY REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE HOLLIES GREW WHICH WAS IN A CONICAL PIT SO THAT THE TOPS OF THE TREES WERE NOT MUCH ABOVE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF THE GROUND THOMASIN STEPPED UP INTO A FORK OF ONE OF THE BUSHES
MADE HIM KNOWN TO THE WATCHMAN OF THE KING HIS WALK IS EXACTLY AS MY HUSBAND'S USED TO BE SHE SAID AND THEN THE THOUGHT BURST UPON HER THAT THE FURZE CUTTER WAS HER SON
AND HELP CARRY ANYTHING FOR'N THOUGH I SUPPOSE HE'S ALTERED FROM THE BOY HE WAS THEY SAY HE CAN TALK FRENCH AS FAST AS A MAID CAN EAT BLACKBERRIES AND IF SO DEPEND UPON IT WE WHO HAVE STAYED AT HOME
WHY DON'T PEOPLE JUDGE ME BY MY ACTS NOW LOOK AT ME AS I KNEEL HERE PICKING UP THESE APPLES DO I LOOK LIKE A LOST WOMAN I WISH ALL GOOD WOMEN WERE AS GOOD AS I SHE
TO ANY OTHER PERSON THAN A MOTHER IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED A LITTLE HUMILIATING THAT SHE THE ELDER OF THE TWO WOMEN SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO MAKE ADVANCES BUT MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD WELL CONSIDERED ALL THAT AND SHE ONLY THOUGHT
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THESE NEW MOVES IN FAMILIES MY FATHER WAS A SAILOR SO WAS I AND SO SHOULD MY SON HAVE BEEN IF I HAD HAD ONE THE PLACE HE'S BEEN LIVING AT IS PARIS SAID HUMPHREY
AND THEY TELL ME TIS WHERE THE KING'S HEAD WAS CUT OFF YEARS AGO MY POOR MOTHER USED TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT BUSINESS HUMMY SHE USED TO SAY I WAS A YOUNG MAID THEN
HOW BEST TO MAKE HER VISIT APPEAR TO EUSTACIA NOT ABJECT BUT WISE FROM HER ELEVATED POSITION THE EXHAUSTED WOMAN COULD PERCEIVE THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE BELOW AND THE GARDEN
SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE WHAT A CLASS TO BELONG TO DO I REALLY BELONG TO THEM TIS ABSURD YET WHY AUNT DOES EVERYBODY KEEP ON MAKING ME THINK THAT I DO BY THE WAY THEY BEHAVE TOWARDS ME
AT THE TIME THAT EUSTACIA WAS LISTENING TO THE RICK MAKERS CONVERSATION ON CLYM'S RETURN THOMASIN WAS CLIMBING INTO A LOFT OVER HER AUNT'S FUELHOUSE WHERE THE STORE APPLES WERE KEPT
THAT WEAK GIRL HOW IS SHE GOING TO GET A MAN TO MARRY HER WHEN SHE CHOOSES BUT LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING AUNT
AND EXHAUSTED STATE TO CONTEMPLATE THEIRS NOT A BOUGH IN THE NINE TREES WHICH COMPOSED THE GROUP BUT WAS SPLINTERED LOPPED AND DISTORTED BY THE FIERCE WEATHER THAT THERE HELD THEM AT ITS MERCY
THOMASIN WAS PERFORCE CONTENT AND YOU WILL KEEP THE SECRET OF MY WOULD BE MARRIAGE FROM CLYM FOR THE PRESENT SHE NEXT ASKED
SUNRISE HAD ADVANCED ITS QUARTERS FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHEAST SUNSET HAD RECEDED FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHWEST BUT EGDON HAD HARDLY HEEDED THE CHANGE
AND SAT DOWN UNDER THEIR SHADE TO RECOVER HERSELF AND TO CONSIDER HOW BEST TO BREAK THE GROUND WITH EUSTACIA SO AS NOT TO IRRITATE A WOMAN UNDERNEATH WHOSE APPARENT INDOLENCE LURKED PASSIONS
WOULD HAVE APPEARED AS THE FERMENT OF STAGNATION MERELY A CREEPING OF THE FLESH OF SOMNOLENCE BUT HERE AWAY FROM COMPARISONS SHUT IN BY THE STABLE HILLS AMONG WHICH MERE WALKING
SOUNDS OF VOICES IN CONVERSATION CAME TO HER EARS DIRECTLY DOWN THE CHIMNEY SHE ENTERED THE RECESS AND LISTENING LOOKED UP THE OLD IRREGULAR SHAFT WITH ITS CAVERNOUS HOLLOWS WHERE THE SMOKE BLUNDERED ABOUT
CERTAIN EPHEMERAL OPERATIONS WERE APT TO DISTURB IN THEIR TRIFLING WAY THE MAJESTIC CALM OF EGDON HEATH THEY WERE ACTIVITIES WHICH BESIDE THOSE OF A TOWN A VILLAGE OR EVEN A FARM
IT IS THE ONLY WAY OUT OF A FALSE POSITION AND A VERY GALLING ONE WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM THAT HE WAS STANDING IN THE WAY OF ANOTHER LOVER OF YOURS AUNT
SHE AND CLYM YEOBRIGHT WOULD MAKE A VERY PRETTY PIGEON PAIR HEY IF THEY WOULDN'T I'LL BE DAZED BOTH OF ONE MIND ABOUT NICETIES FOR CERTAIN AND LEARNED IN PRINT
HAD BEEN PASSED IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL THE CENTRE AND VORTEX
IT WAS NOW NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE SUNLIGHT WAS LEAVING THE VALES WHEN THE WEST GREW RED THE TWO RELATIVES CAME AGAIN FROM THE HOUSE AND PLUNGED INTO THE HEATH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM THE FIRST
IT WAS A FINE AND QUIET AFTERNOON ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK BUT THE WINTER SOLSTICE HAVING STEALTHILY COME ON THE LOWNESS OF THE SUN CAUSED THE HOUR TO SEEM LATER THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS
AND THAT I DID NOT EXPECT HIM HOME SO SOON AND YOU MUST NOT LET ME STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR CHRISTMAS PARTY PUTTING IT OFF WOULD ONLY MAKE MATTERS WORSE OF COURSE I SHALL NOT I DO NOT WISH TO SHOW MYSELF BEATEN BEFORE ALL EGDON
EUSTACIA WAS INDOORS IN THE DINING ROOM WHICH WAS REALLY MORE LIKE A KITCHEN HAVING A STONE FLOOR AND A GAPING CHIMNEY CORNER THE AIR WAS STILL AND WHILE SHE LINGERED A MOMENT HERE ALONE
REPLIED THE GIRL HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING AND TEARS SO CROWDED THEMSELVES INTO HER EYES THAT SHE COULD HARDLY DISTINGUISH APPLES FROM FERN AS SHE CONTINUED INDUSTRIOUSLY SEARCHING TO HIDE HER WEAKNESS
THERE BEING LITTLE HERE TO REMIND AN INHABITANT THAT HE MUST UNLEARN HIS SUMMER EXPERIENCE OF THE SKY AS A DIAL IN THE COURSE OF MANY DAYS AND WEEKS
THE PRISON OF MARY STUART OR THE CHATEAU OF HOUGOMONT AFTER PASSING ROUND AND AGAIN REACHING THE GATE HE WENT IN
WHICH ADMITTED THE SUNLIGHT SO DIRECTLY UPON HER BROWN HAIR AND TRANSPARENT TISSUES THAT IT ALMOST SEEMED TO SHINE THROUGH HER IF HE COULD HAVE BEEN DEAR TO YOU IN ANOTHER WAY SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FROM THE LADDER
MISSUS YEOBRIGHT STRAINED HER EYES AND AT LAST SAID THAT SHE DID PERCEIVE HIM
BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF IT HE MUST SOON KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED A MERE LOOK AT YOUR FACE WILL SHOW HIM THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG THOMASIN TURNED AND REGARDED HER AUNT FROM THE TREE
AND THAT YOU ACT A PART TO ME HE WISHED TO MARRY ME
AND THINKING THE REGULATION THOUGHTS TO JUDGE BY HIS MOTIONS PLANNING A DOZEN HASTY SCHEMES FOR AT ONCE PRESERVING HIM AND EUSTACIA FROM THIS MODE OF LIFE SHE THROBBINGLY FOLLOWED THE WAY AND SAW HIM
WHY SHOULD SHE NOT GO THAT WAY THE SCENE OF THE DAYDREAM IS SUFFICIENT FOR A PILGRIMAGE AT NINETEEN TO LOOK AT THE PALINGS BEFORE THE YEOBRIGHTS HOUSE HAD THE DIGNITY OF A NECESSARY PERFORMANCE
HAD THE NOVELTY OF PAGEANTRY AND WHERE ANY MAN COULD IMAGINE HIMSELF TO BE ADAM WITHOUT THE LEAST DIFFICULTY THEY ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF EVERY BIRD WITHIN EYESHOT EVERY REPTILE NOT YET ASLEEP
THUS QUIETLY SHE COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IN THE MORNING THAT HER COLOURLESS INNER WORLD WOULD BEFORE NIGHT BECOME AS ANIMATED AS WATER UNDER A MICROSCOPE AND THAT WITHOUT THE ARRIVAL OF A SINGLE VISITOR
NOW I PUT IT TO YOU WOULD YOU AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT AGREE TO BE HIS WIFE IF THAT HAD NOT HAPPENED TO ENTANGLE YOU WITH HIM THOMASIN LOOKED INTO THE TREE AND APPEARED MUCH DISTURBED
WHICH MARKED THE VERGE OF THE HEATH IN THIS LATITUDE THEY SHOWED UPON THE DUSKY SCENE THAT THEY BORDERED AS DISTINCTLY AS WHITE LACE ON VELVET BEHIND THE WHITE PALINGS WAS A LITTLE GARDEN BEHIND THE GARDEN
IS THE VERY THING THAT WILL HINDER THE TALE FROM REACHING HIM EARLY IF I AM NOT MADE SAFE FROM SNEERS IN A WEEK OR TWO I WILL TELL HIM MYSELF THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH THOMASIN SPOKE PREVENTED FURTHER OBJECTIONS
AT WHICH MYRIADS OF IMPRISONED SHAPES AROSE WHERE HAD PREVIOUSLY APPEARED THE STILLNESS OF A VOID
AS A BLACK SPOT IN THE AIR ABOVE THE CROWN OF THE HILL ON REACHING THIS PLACE MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FELT DISTRESSINGLY AGITATED WEARY AND UNWELL SHE ASCENDED
HOW DO YOU MEAN I HAVE LONG HAD A SUSPICION THAT YOUR LOVE FOR HIM HAS CHANGED ITS COLOUR
CLEON WALKS CLEON IS AN INSTANCE OF SUCH A PART A SPEECH IS SAID TO BE ONE IN TWO WAYS EITHER AS SIGNIFYING ONE THING OR AS A UNION OF SEVERAL SPEECHES MADE INTO ONE BY CONJUNCTION
AND THESE TWO THINGS ARE TO BE FOUND IN DULCINEA IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE FOR IN BEAUTY NO ONE EQUALS HER AND IN GOOD NAME FEW APPROACH HER AND TO PUT THE WHOLE THING IN A NUTSHELL I PERSUADE MYSELF THAT ALL I SAY IS AS I SAY
IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT A SPEECH IS NOT ALWAYS MADE UP OF NOUN AND VERB IT MAY BE WITHOUT A VERB LIKE THE DEFINITION OF MAN BUT IT WILL ALWAYS HAVE SOME PART WITH A CERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE BY ITSELF IN THE SPEECH
WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF A STORY AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF NEARLY ALL THE EARLY DRAMATISTS WE MAINTAIN THEREFORE THAT THE FIRST ESSENTIAL THE LIFE AND SOUL SO TO SPEAK OF TRAGEDY IS THE PLOT
AN INSTANCE OF THIS WOULD BE TO CALL THE SHIELD
IN WRITING AN ODYSSEY HE DID NOT MAKE THE POEM COVER ALL THAT EVER BEFELL HIS HERO IT BEFELL HIM FOR INSTANCE TO GET WOUNDED ON PARNASSUS AND ALSO TO FEIGN MADNESS AT THE TIME OF THE CALL TO ARMS
THOUGH AN ATTRACTION IS THE LEAST ARTISTIC OF ALL THE PARTS AND HAS LEAST TO DO WITH THE ART OF POETRY THE TRAGIC EFFECT IS QUITE POSSIBLE WITHOUT A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE AND ACTORS
IS NOT TO BE MENTIONED IN THE HOUSE OF HIM WHO HAS BEEN HANGED BUT NOW FOR THE LETTER AND THEN GOD BE WITH YOU I AM OFF DON QUIXOTE TOOK OUT THE NOTE BOOK AND RETIRING TO ONE SIDE VERY DELIBERATELY BEGAN TO WRITE THE LETTER
AND FELT EASY AND SATISFIED IN HIS MIND THAT HE COULD SWEAR HE HAD LEFT HIS MASTER MAD AND SO WE WILL LEAVE HIM TO FOLLOW HIS ROAD UNTIL HIS RETURN
SINCE IT IS FROM THESE THAT WE ASCRIBE CERTAIN QUALITIES TO THEIR ACTIONS THERE ARE IN THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS THEREFORE TWO CAUSES CHARACTER AND THOUGHT
WHICH PROTAGORAS HAS CRITICIZED AS BEING A COMMAND WHERE A PRAYER WAS MEANT SINCE TO BID ONE DO OR NOT DO HE TELLS US IS A COMMAND
THE UNITY OF A PLOT DOES NOT CONSIST AS SOME SUPPOSE IN ITS HAVING ONE MAN AS ITS SUBJECT AN INFINITY OF THINGS BEFALL THAT ONE MAN SOME OF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REDUCE TO UNITY
CUT SOME HE ASKED HIS MASTER'S BLESSING AND NOT WITHOUT MANY TEARS ON BOTH SIDES TOOK HIS LEAVE OF HIM
THE LETTER OR ULTIMATE ELEMENT THE SYLLABLE THE CONJUNCTION THE ARTICLE THE NOUN THE VERB THE CASE AND THE SPEECH ONE
END IN I AND FIVE IN T
NOTHING OF THE KIND THEY ONLY INVENT THEM FOR THE MOST PART TO FURNISH A SUBJECT FOR THEIR VERSES AND THAT THEY MAY PASS FOR LOVERS OR FOR MEN VALIANT ENOUGH TO BE SO
WHICH WILL BE WITH THE NEWS YOUR WORSHIP DESIRES AND DESERVES IF NOT LET THE LADY DULCINEA LOOK TO IT IF SHE DOES NOT ANSWER REASONABLY
WE MAINTAIN THAT TRAGEDY IS PRIMARILY AN IMITATION OF ACTION AND THAT IT IS MAINLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE ACTION THAT IT IMITATES THE PERSONAL AGENTS THIRD COMES THE ELEMENT OF THOUGHT
INDIVISIBLE SOUNDS ARE UTTERED BY THE BRUTES ALSO BUT NO ONE OF THESE IS A LETTER IN OUR SENSE OF THE TERM THESE ELEMENTARY SOUNDS ARE EITHER VOWELS SEMIVOWELS OR MUTES
C SO IS EVENING B TO DAY A ONE WILL ACCORDINGLY DESCRIBE EVENING B AS THE OLD AGE OF THE DAY D PLUS A OR BY THE
AGAIN TO BE BEAUTIFUL A LIVING CREATURE AND EVERY WHOLE MADE UP OF PARTS MUST NOT ONLY PRESENT A CERTAIN ORDER IN ITS ARRANGEMENT OF PARTS BUT ALSO BE OF A CERTAIN DEFINITE MAGNITUDE
AND THE LIKE WHATEVER ITS STRUCTURE A NOUN MUST ALWAYS BE EITHER ONE THE ORDINARY WORD FOR THE THING OR TWO A STRANGE WORD OR THREE A METAPHOR
IN THIS WAY SEEING EVERYTHING WITH THE VIVIDNESS OF AN EYE WITNESS AS IT WERE HE WILL DEVISE WHAT IS APPROPRIATE AND BE LEAST LIKELY TO OVERLOOK INCONGRUITIES THIS IS SHOWN BY WHAT WAS CENSURED IN
THE FOURTH CONSTITUENT IS THAT OF SPECTACLE EXEMPLIFIED IN THE
A VOWEL IS A LETTER HAVING AN AUDIBLE SOUND WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF ANOTHER LETTER
AS FAR AS MAY BE TOO THE POET SHOULD EVEN ACT HIS STORY WITH THE VERY GESTURES OF HIS PERSONAGES GIVEN THE SAME NATURAL QUALIFICATIONS HE WHO FEELS THE EMOTIONS TO BE DESCRIBED WILL BE THE MOST CONVINCING
THE STORY ALSO OF HERACLES MUST BE ONE STORY HOMER HOWEVER EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD THIS POINT QUITE WELL WHETHER BY ART OR INSTINCT JUST IN THE SAME WAY AS HE EXCELS THE REST IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT
AND IN THE SECOND MELODY AND DICTION THESE TWO BEING THE MEANS OF THEIR IMITATION HERE BY DICTION I MEAN MERELY THIS THE COMPOSITION OF THE VERSES AND BY MELODY WHAT IS TOO COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD TO REQUIRE EXPLANATION
AND ONE DAY SAID TO THE WORTHY WIDOW BY WAY OF BROTHERLY REMONSTRANCE I AM SURPRISED SENORA AND NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON THAT A WOMAN OF SUCH HIGH STANDING SO FAIR AND SO RICH AS YOU ARE
I AM NOT SO MAD ANSWERED SANCHO BUT I AM MORE PEPPERY BUT APART FROM ALL THIS WHAT HAS YOUR WORSHIP TO EAT UNTIL I COME BACK WILL YOU SALLY OUT ON THE ROAD LIKE CARDENIO TO FORCE IT FROM THE SHEPHERDS
THE HEALTH THAT HE HIMSELF ENJOYS NOT IF THY BEAUTY DESPISES ME IF THY WORTH IS NOT FOR ME IF THY SCORN IS MY AFFLICTION THOUGH I BE SUFFICIENTLY LONG SUFFERING HARDLY SHALL I ENDURE THIS ANXIETY WHICH
THAT WE ARE HAPPY OR THE REVERSE IN A PLAY ACCORDINGLY THEY DO NOT ACT IN ORDER TO PORTRAY THE CHARACTERS THEY INCLUDE THE CHARACTERS FOR THE SAKE OF THE ACTION
I SAY THAT YOUR WORSHIP IS ENTIRELY RIGHT SAID SANCHO AND THAT I AM AN ASS BUT I KNOW NOT HOW THE NAME OF ASS CAME INTO MY MOUTH FOR A ROPE
THE POET'S AIM THEN SHOULD BE TO COMBINE EVERY ELEMENT OF INTEREST IF POSSIBLE OR ELSE THE MORE IMPORTANT AND THE MAJOR PART OF THEM THIS IS NOW ESPECIALLY NECESSARY OWING TO THE UNFAIR CRITICISM TO WHICH THE POET IS SUBJECTED IN THESE DAYS
THAT WILL DO SAID SANCHO NOW LET YOUR WORSHIP SIGN IT THERE IS NO NEED TO SIGN IT SAID DON QUIXOTE BUT MERELY TO PUT MY FLOURISH WHICH IS THE SAME AS A SIGNATURE AND ENOUGH FOR THREE ASSES OR EVEN THREE HUNDRED
AS THE MOST EXALTED PRINCESS ON EARTH IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT ALL THOSE POETS WHO SANG THE PRAISES OF LADIES UNDER THE FANCY NAMES THEY GIVE THEM HAD ANY SUCH MISTRESSES
WHETHER THE POET KNOWS THESE THINGS OR NOT HIS ART AS A POET IS NEVER SERIOUSLY CRITICIZED ON THAT ACCOUNT
THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE SIX IS THE COMBINATION OF THE INCIDENTS OF THE STORY TRAGEDY IS ESSENTIALLY AN IMITATION NOT OF PERSONS BUT OF ACTION AND LIFE OF HAPPINESS AND MISERY
ON HIS COMING HE WAS ARRESTED AND ABOUT TO BE SACRIFICED WHEN HE REVEALED WHO HE WAS
HAVING BEEN OFFERED IN SACRIFICE AND SPIRITED AWAY FROM HER SACRIFICERS INTO ANOTHER LAND WHERE THE CUSTOM WAS TO SACRIFICE ALL STRANGERS TO THE GODDESS SHE WAS MADE THERE THE PRIESTESS OF THIS RITE
AND HAS ALSO ANOTHER AFTER IT A WELL CONSTRUCTED PLOT THEREFORE CANNOT EITHER BEGIN OR END AT ANY POINT ONE LIKES BEGINNING AND END IN IT MUST BE OF THE FORMS JUST DESCRIBED
AT THE TIME WHEN HE IS CONSTRUCTING HIS PLOTS AND ENGAGED ON THE DICTION IN WHICH THEY ARE WORKED OUT THE POET SHOULD REMEMBER ONE TO PUT THE ACTUAL SCENES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE BEFORE HIS EYES
SUNLIGHT A AS SOWING D TO THE SEED CORN C HENCE THE EXPRESSION IN THE POET SOWING AROUND A GOD CREATED FLAME D PLUS A
EMPEDOCLEAN EQUIVALENT AND OLD AGE D AS THE EVENING OR SUNSET OF LIFE B PLUS C
THE TURNS GIVEN TO THE LANGUAGE WHEN SPOKEN
NOT A FEW OF THE DRAMATISTS HAVE MADE DUE USE AS EVERY PLAY ONE MAY SAY ADMITS OF SPECTACLE CHARACTER FABLE DICTION MELODY AND THOUGHT
A SIZE TO BE TAKEN IN BY THE EYE SO A STORY OR PLOT MUST BE OF SOME LENGTH BUT OF A LENGTH TO BE TAKEN IN BY THE MEMORY AS FOR THE LIMIT OF ITS LENGTH SO FAR AS THAT IS RELATIVE TO PUBLIC PERFORMANCES AND SPECTATORS
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SWEAR WITHOUT A WEIGHT ON MY CONSCIENCE THAT I HAD SEEN YOU DO MAD THINGS IT WOULD BE WELL FOR ME TO SEE IF IT WERE ONLY ONE THOUGH IN YOUR WORSHIP'S REMAINING HERE I HAVE SEEN A VERY GREAT ONE
EITHER FAIL UTTERLY OR HAVE BUT ILL SUCCESS ON THE STAGE
OF THEIR ACTIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY OF THEIR SUCCESS OR FAILURE IN THEIR LIVES NOW THE ACTION THAT WHICH WAS DONE IS REPRESENTED IN THE PLAY BY THE FABLE OR PLOT THE FABLE
THOU MUST KNOW THAT A CERTAIN WIDOW FAIR YOUNG INDEPENDENT AND RICH AND ABOVE ALL FREE AND EASY FELL IN LOVE WITH A STURDY STRAPPING YOUNG LAY BROTHER HIS SUPERIOR CAME TO KNOW OF IT
OBSERVE THE LANDMARKS WELL SAID DON QUIXOTE FOR I WILL TRY NOT TO GO FAR FROM THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD AND I WILL EVEN TAKE CARE TO MOUNT THE HIGHEST OF THESE ROCKS TO SEE IF I CAN DISCOVER THEE RETURNING
OR WHAT IS APPROPRIATE TO THE OCCASION
ALL THAT THEY WILL BE METAPHORICALLY DESCRIBED IN JUST THE SAME WAY THUS TO CAST FORTH SEED
OF A SIGNIFICANT AND A NON SIGNIFICANT PART
THESE WILL SERVE THEE AFTER THE FASHION OF THE CLUE IN THE LABYRINTH OF THESEUS AS MARKS AND SIGNS FOR FINDING ME ON THY RETURN SO I WILL SAID SANCHO PANZA AND HAVING
A LENGTH WHICH ALLOWS OF THE HERO PASSING BY A SERIES OF PROBABLE OR NECESSARY STAGES FROM MISFORTUNE TO HAPPINESS OR FROM HAPPINESS TO MISFORTUNE MAY SUFFICE AS A LIMIT FOR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STORY
THE LIMIT HOWEVER SET BY THE ACTUAL NATURE OF THE THING IS THIS THE LONGER THE STORY CONSISTENTLY WITH ITS BEING COMPREHENSIBLE AS A WHOLE THE FINER IT IS BY REASON OF ITS MAGNITUDE AS A ROUGH GENERAL FORMULA
AND THERE IS NOTHING ELSE BESIDES THESE SIX OF THESE ITS FORMATIVE ELEMENTS
NOR ANY OTHER OF THE FAMOUS WOMEN OF TIMES PAST GREEK BARBARIAN OR LATIN AND LET EACH SAY WHAT HE WILL FOR IF IN THIS I AM TAKEN TO TASK BY THE IGNORANT I SHALL NOT BE CENSURED BY THE CRITICAL
B PLUS C OR TO TAKE ANOTHER INSTANCE
WHERE THAT IS NOT OBVIOUS HENCE THERE IS NO ROOM FOR CHARACTER IN A SPEECH ON A PURELY INDIFFERENT SUBJECT THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND IS SHOWN IN ALL THEY SAY WHEN PROVING OR DISPROVING SOME PARTICULAR POINT
POLEOS PELEIADEO FOR PELEIDON IT IS SAID TO BE CURTAILED WHEN IT HAS LOST A PART
BUT IF IT IS YOUR WORSHIP'S PLEASURE THAT I SHOULD SEE SOME INSANITIES DO THEM IN YOUR CLOTHES SHORT ONES AND SUCH AS COME READIEST TO HAND FOR I MYSELF WANT NOTHING OF THE SORT AND AS I HAVE SAID IT WILL BE A SAVING OF TIME FOR MY RETURN
THINE TILL DEATH THE KNIGHT OF THE RUEFUL COUNTENANCE BY THE LIFE OF MY FATHER SAID SANCHO WHEN HE HEARD THE LETTER
FOR THE OLDER POETS MAKE THEIR PERSONAGES DISCOURSE LIKE STATESMEN AND THE MODERNS LIKE RHETORICIANS
BEFORE PROCEEDING TO LENGTHEN IT OUT BY THE INSERTION OF EPISODES THE FOLLOWING WILL SHOW HOW THE UNIVERSAL ELEMENT IN IPHIGENIA FOR INSTANCE MAY BE VIEWED A CERTAIN MAIDEN
AN END IS THAT WHICH IS NATURALLY AFTER SOMETHING ITSELF EITHER AS ITS NECESSARY OR USUAL CONSEQUENT AND WITH NOTHING ELSE AFTER IT AND A MIDDLE THAT WHICH IS BY NATURE AFTER ONE THING
OF THIS LAST KIND EIGHT A SPEECH IS A COMPOSITE SIGNIFICANT SOUND SOME OF THE PARTS OF WHICH HAVE A CERTAIN SIGNIFICANCE BY THEMSELVES
LET NOT THAT ANXIETY TROUBLE THEE REPLIED DON QUIXOTE FOR EVEN IF I HAD IT I SHOULD NOT EAT ANYTHING BUT THE HERBS AND THE FRUITS WHICH THIS MEADOW AND THESE TREES MAY YIELD ME THE BEAUTY OF THIS BUSINESS OF MINE LIES IN NOT EATING
BY ATTEMPTING TO DRAMATIZE FOR INSTANCE THE ENTIRE STORY OF THE ILIAD IN THE EPIC OWING TO ITS SCALE EVERY PART IS TREATED AT PROPER LENGTH WITH A DRAMA HOWEVER ON THE SAME STORY THE RESULT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING
NEITHER MORE NOR LESS AND I PICTURE HER IN MY IMAGINATION AS I WOULD HAVE HER TO BE AS WELL IN BEAUTY AS IN CONDITION HELEN APPROACHES HER NOT NOR DOES LUCRETIA COME UP TO HER
OR NOT THE SAME AS ANOTHER TO DO SO ON THE GROUND BEFORE ALL ELSE OF THEIR PLOT
A CERTAIN MAN HAS BEEN ABROAD MANY YEARS POSEIDON IS EVER ON THE WATCH FOR HIM AND HE IS ALL ALONE MATTERS AT HOME TOO HAVE COME TO THIS THAT HIS SUBSTANCE IS BEING WASTED
A CASE OF A NOUN OR VERB IS WHEN THE WORD MEANS OF OR TO A THING AND SO FORTH
AND I FOR MY PART RECKON HER THE MOST EXALTED PRINCESS IN THE WORLD FOR THOU SHOULDST KNOW SANCHO IF THOU DOST NOT KNOW THAT TWO THINGS ALONE BEYOND ALL OTHERS ARE INCENTIVES TO LOVE AND THESE ARE GREAT BEAUTY AND A GOOD NAME
SOVEREIGN AND EXALTED LADY THE PIERCED BY THE POINT OF ABSENCE THE WOUNDED TO THE HEART'S CORE SENDS THEE SWEETEST DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO
IT IS TO BE REMEMBERED THAT IN A COMPOUND WE DO NOT THINK OF THE PARTS AS HAVING A SIGNIFICANCE ALSO BY THEMSELVES IN THE NAME THEODORUS FOR INSTANCE THE DORON MEANS NOTHING TO US
SHOULD HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH SUCH A MEAN LOW STUPID FELLOW AS SO AND SO WHEN IN THIS HOUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MASTERS GRADUATES AND DIVINITY STUDENTS FROM AMONG WHOM YOU MIGHT CHOOSE AS IF THEY WERE A LOT OF PEARS SAYING THIS ONE I'LL TAKE
AND BY THE KINDS SEPARATELY I MEAN THAT SOME PORTIONS ARE WORKED OUT WITH VERSE ONLY AND OTHERS IN
OR OF TWO SIGNIFICANT PARTS IT IS POSSIBLE ALSO TO HAVE TRIPLE QUADRUPLE OR HIGHER COMPOUNDS LIKE MOST OF OUR AMPLIFIED NAMES
AND THAT THE CHARACTERS COME SECOND COMPARE THE PARALLEL IN PAINTING WHERE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLOURS LAID ON WITHOUT ORDER WILL NOT GIVE ONE THE SAME PLEASURE AS A SIMPLE BLACK AND WHITE SKETCH OF A PORTRAIT
THAT FROM SPECIES TO GENUS IN TRULY TEN THOUSAND GOOD DEEDS HAS ULYSSES WROUGHT WHERE TEN THOUSAND WHICH IS A PARTICULAR LARGE NUMBER IS PUT IN PLACE OF THE GENERIC A LARGE NUMBER
CERTAIN ALSO OF THOSE WITHIN THE PLAY FORMING THE COMPLICATION AND THE REST THE DENOUEMENT BY COMPLICATION I MEAN ALL FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY TO THE POINT JUST BEFORE THE CHANGE IN THE HERO'S FORTUNES BY
POLYGNOTUS FOR WHEREAS THE LATTER IS STRONG IN CHARACTER THE WORK OF ZEUXIS IS DEVOID OF IT AND AGAIN ONE MAY STRING TOGETHER A SERIES OF CHARACTERISTIC SPEECHES OF THE UTMOST FINISH AS REGARDS DICTION AND THOUGHT
DID I NOT TELL THEE SO SAID DON QUIXOTE WAIT SANCHO AND I WILL DO THEM IN THE SAYING OF A CREDO AND PULLING OFF HIS BREECHES IN ALL HASTE HE STRIPPED HIMSELF TO HIS SKIN AND HIS SHIRT AND THEN
TO THIS EFFECT MISTRESS NIECE BY THIS FIRST OF ASS COLTS PLEASE PAY TO SANCHO PANZA MY SQUIRE THREE OF THE FIVE I LEFT AT HOME IN YOUR CHARGE SAID THREE ASS COLTS TO BE PAID AND DELIVERED FOR THE SAME
SO I TOO AM DOOMED TO BE SACRIFICED AS MY SISTER WAS AND THE DISCLOSURE LED TO HIS SALVATION THIS DONE THE NEXT THING AFTER THE PROPER NAMES HAVE BEEN FIXED AS A BASIS FOR THE STORY
LONG AFTER THAT THE BROTHER OF THE PRIESTESS HAPPENED TO COME THE FACT HOWEVER OF THE ORACLE HAVING FOR A CERTAIN REASON BIDDEN HIM GO THITHER AND HIS OBJECT IN GOING ARE OUTSIDE THE PLOT OF THE PLAY
THOUGH NOT IN REFERENCE TO THE SAME PEOPLE SIGUNOS FOR INSTANCE IS AN ORDINARY WORD IN CYPRUS AND A STRANGE WORD WITH US
WITHOUT MORE ADO HE CUT A COUPLE OF GAMBADOS IN THE AIR AND A COUPLE OF SOMERSAULTS HEELS OVER HEAD
IS TO WORK IN EPISODES OR ACCESSORY INCIDENTS ONE MUST MIND HOWEVER THAT THE EPISODES ARE APPROPRIATE LIKE THE FIT OF MADNESS IN ORESTES WHICH LED TO HIS ARREST AND THE PURIFYING WHICH BROUGHT ABOUT HIS SALVATION
AND HIS SON'S DEATH PLOTTED BY SUITORS TO HIS WIFE THEN HE ARRIVES THERE HIMSELF AFTER HIS GRIEVOUS SUFFERINGS REVEALS HIMSELF AND FALLS ON HIS ENEMIES AND THE END IS HIS SALVATION AND THEIR DEATH
BEAUTY IS A MATTER OF SIZE AND ORDER AND THEREFORE IMPOSSIBLE EITHER ONE IN A VERY MINUTE CREATURE SINCE OUR PERCEPTION BECOMES INDISTINCT AS IT APPROACHES INSTANTANEITY OR TWO
HAVE AS MUCH CARE AS OF HIS OWN PERSON HE SET OUT FOR THE PLAIN STREWING AT INTERVALS THE BRANCHES OF BROOM AS HIS MASTER HAD RECOMMENDED HIM AND SO HE WENT HIS WAY THOUGH DON QUIXOTE STILL ENTREATED HIM TO SEE HIM
AND I PROMISE THEE THOU WILT NOT TELL OF AS MANY AS I MEAN TO PERFORM FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MASTER MINE SAID SANCHO
HOWEVER NOT TO MISS ME AND LOSE THYSELF THE BEST PLAN WILL BE TO CUT SOME BRANCHES OF THE BROOM THAT IS SO ABUNDANT ABOUT HERE AND AS THOU GOEST TO LAY THEM AT INTERVALS UNTIL THOU HAST COME OUT UPON THE PLAIN
BUT THE TWO INCIDENTS HAD NO PROBABLE OR NECESSARY CONNEXION WITH ONE ANOTHER INSTEAD OF DOING THAT HE TOOK AN ACTION WITH A UNITY OF THE KIND WE ARE DESCRIBING AS THE SUBJECT OF THE ODYSSEY AS ALSO OF THE ILIAD
AS LONG SHORT OR OF VARIABLE QUANTITY AND FURTHER AS HAVING AN ACUTE GRAVE OR INTERMEDIATE ACCENT THE DETAILS OF THESE MATTERS WE MUST LEAVE TO THE METRICIANS
THAT I WON'T TAKE BUT SHE REPLIED TO HIM WITH GREAT SPRIGHTLINESS AND CANDOUR MY DEAR SIR YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN AND YOUR IDEAS ARE VERY OLD FASHIONED IF YOU THINK THAT I HAVE MADE A BAD CHOICE IN SO AND SO
WITH ITS SEVERAL INCIDENTS SO CLOSELY CONNECTED THAT THE TRANSPOSAL OR WITHDRAWAL
D TO THE THIRD C FOR ONE MAY THEN METAPHORICALLY PUT B IN LIEU OF D AND D IN LIEU OF B NOW AND THEN TOO THEY QUALIFY
THE LETTERS DIFFER IN VARIOUS WAYS AS PRODUCED BY DIFFERENT CONFORMATIONS OR IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE MOUTH AS ASPIRATED NOT ASPIRATED OR SOMETIMES ONE AND SOMETIMES THE OTHER
IF IT BE THY PLEASURE TO GIVE ME RELIEF I AM THINE IF NOT DO AS MAY BE PLEASING TO THEE FOR BY ENDING MY LIFE I SHALL SATISFY THY CRUELTY AND MY DESIRE
AND YET FAIL TO PRODUCE THE TRUE TRAGIC EFFECT BUT ONE WILL HAVE MUCH BETTER SUCCESS WITH A TRAGEDY WHICH HOWEVER INFERIOR IN THESE RESPECTS HAS A PLOT A COMBINATION OF INCIDENTS IN IT
IN A DRAMATIC NOT IN A NARRATIVE FORM WITH INCIDENTS AROUSING PITY AND FEAR WHEREWITH TO ACCOMPLISH ITS CATHARSIS OF SUCH EMOTIONS
AND SO IT SUFFICES ME TO THINK AND BELIEVE THAT THE GOOD ALDONZA LORENZO IS FAIR AND VIRTUOUS AND AS TO HER PEDIGREE IT IS VERY LITTLE MATTER FOR NO ONE WILL EXAMINE INTO IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONFERRING ANY ORDER UPON HER
H AND O AND IN A AMONG THE VOWELS THAT MAY BE LONG ARE FEMININES SO THAT THERE IS AN EQUAL NUMBER OF MASCULINE AND FEMININE
THIS BEING ALL THAT IS PROPER TO THE ODYSSEY EVERYTHING ELSE IN IT IS EPISODE
HER LADYSHIP HAD BEST NOT DRIVE ME TO SAY IT FOR BY GOD I WILL SPEAK OUT AND LET OFF EVERYTHING CHEAP EVEN IF IT DOESN'T SELL I AM PRETTY GOOD AT THAT SHE LITTLE KNOWS ME FAITH
WITH AN A THE VARIOUS FORMS OF THE SYLLABLE ALSO BELONG TO THE THEORY OF METRE THREE A CONJUNCTION IS A
P S OR IN THE TWO COMPOUNDS OF THIS LAST P S AND X ARE MASCULINES ALL ENDING IN THE INVARIABLY LONG VOWELS
IF SHE KNEW ME SHE'D BE IN AWE OF ME IN FAITH SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE TO ALL APPEARANCE THOU ART NO SOUNDER IN THY WITS THAN I
DENOUEMENT YET THERE ARE MANY DRAMATISTS WHO AFTER A GOOD COMPLICATION FAIL IN THE DENOUEMENT BUT IT IS NECESSARY FOR BOTH POINTS OF CONSTRUCTION TO BE ALWAYS DULY MASTERED
OR WHITE DOES NOT IMPLY WHEN WALKS AND HAS WALKED INVOLVE IN ADDITION TO THE IDEA OF WALKING THAT OF TIME PRESENT OR TIME PAST SEVEN
ONE SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER WHAT HAS BEEN SAID MORE THAN ONCE AND NOT WRITE A TRAGEDY ON AN EPIC BODY OF INCIDENT
YET IN THEIR PERIPETIES AS ALSO IN THEIR SIMPLE PLOTS THE POETS I MEAN SHOW WONDERFUL SKILL IN AIMING AT THE KIND OF EFFECT THEY DESIRE A TRAGIC SITUATION THAT AROUSES THE HUMAN FEELING IN ONE LIKE THE CLEVER VILLAIN
AND NEED NOT BE COUNTED THERE IS NO NOUN HOWEVER ENDING IN A MUTE OR IN EITHER OF THE TWO SHORT VOWELS E AND O ONLY THREE
COSTUMIER THAN THE POET
A NON SIGNIFICANT SOUND WHICH WHEN ONE SIGNIFICANT SOUND IS FORMABLE OUT OF SEVERAL NEITHER HINDERS NOR AIDS THE UNION AND WHICH IF THE SPEECH
THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER FORM OF QUALIFIED METAPHOR HAVING GIVEN THE THING THE ALIEN NAME ONE MAY BY A NEGATIVE ADDITION DENY OF IT ONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES NATURALLY ASSOCIATED WITH ITS NEW NAME
THE TRAGEDIES OF MOST OF THE MODERNS ARE CHARACTERLESS A DEFECT COMMON AMONG POETS OF ALL KINDS AND WITH ITS COUNTERPART IN PAINTING
BUT FOLK NOT PREJUDICED SAW THE GLUG AS HIS NURSE REMARKED IN THE CUT OF HIS MUG FOR HE HAD THEIR HAIR AND HE HAD THEIR EYES AND THE GLUG EXPRESSION OF PAINED SURPRISE AND THEIR PREDILECTION FOR PUMPKIN PIES
BUT HE NOW HASTILY BEGAN AGAIN USING THE INK THAT WAS TRICKLING DOWN HIS FACE AS LONG AS IT LASTED THEN THE WORDS DON'T FIT YOU SAID THE KING LOOKING ROUND THE COURT WITH A SMILE THERE WAS A DEAD SILENCE
DO WE BLAME THE NIGHT WHEN DARKNESS GATHERS AND NONE CAN SEE SAID HE WHENEVER THERE SPRINGS FROM EARTH A PLANT ALL CROOKED AND MARRED AT BIRTH SHALL WE UNLEARNED IN THE GARDENER'S SCHEME BLAME PLANT OR EARTH FOR THE FAULTS THAT SEEM
AND THERE CAME TO THE WONDERING MIND OF HIM LONG THOUGHTS OF THE RIDDLE THAT VEXES YOUTH AND FATHER HE SAID IN THE MART'S LOUD DIN IS THERE AUGHT OF PLEASURE DO SOME FIND JOY BUT HIS FATHER TILTED THE BEARDLESS CHIN
AND THIS WAS HER DREAM FIRST SHE DREAMED OF LITTLE ALICE HERSELF AND ONCE AGAIN THE TINY HANDS WERE CLASPED UPON HER KNEE AND THE BRIGHT EAGER EYES WERE LOOKING UP INTO HERS SHE COULD HEAR THE VERY TONES OF HER VOICE
YOU CAN'T SWIM CAN YOU HE ADDED TURNING TO THE KNAVE THE KNAVE SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY DO I LOOK LIKE IT HE SAID WHICH HE CERTAINLY DID NOT BEING MADE ENTIRELY OF CARDBOARD
THEN EVERY GLUG WHO WAS NOT TOO FAT TURNED SEVENTEEN HANDSPRINGS AND JUMPED ON HIS HAT THEY FINED THE GLUG WITH THE CAST IN HIS EYE FOR LOOKING BOTH WAYS WHICH HE DID NOT DENY AND FOR HAVING NO VISIBLE PRECEDENT WHICH IS A CRIME IN THE POOR AND A FAULT IN THE RICH
FOR THAT GROCER OF OURS IN THE LIGHT BROWN HAT ASKS TWO AND ELEVEN FOR PICKLES LIKE THAT
AND THEY TELL OF A PERFECTLY EASY WAY FOR YESTERDAY'S GLUG IS THE GLUG OF TO DAY AND THEY CLIMB THE TREES WHEN THE THUNDER ROLLS TO SOLEMNLY SALVE THEIR SHOP WORN SOULS FOR THEY FEAR THE COALS THAT THREATEN TO FRIZZLE THEIR SHOP WORN SOULS
FOUR SYM THE SON OF JOI NOW JOI THE REBEL HE HAD A SON IN FAR FAR GOSH WHERE THE TALL TREES WAVE SAID JOI
BEING QUITE UNABLE TO MOVE SHE SOON GOT IT OUT AGAIN AND PUT IT RIGHT NOT THAT IT SIGNIFIES MUCH SHE SAID TO HERSELF
AND EVERYBODY LAUGHED LET THE JURY CONSIDER THEIR VERDICT THE KING SAID FOR ABOUT THE TWENTIETH TIME THAT DAY NO NO SAID THE QUEEN SENTENCE FIRST VERDICT AFTERWARDS
HE TRUSTS TO YOU TO SET THEM FREE EXACTLY AS WE WERE MY NOTION WAS THAT YOU HAD BEEN BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT AN OBSTACLE THAT CAME BETWEEN HIM AND OURSELVES AND IT
AND IN BRICKS OR ROAD METAL FOR GOODS YOU WILL SETTLE INDENTED BY YOUR MISTER GHONES CRIED THE GLUGS PRAISINGLY WHY HOW AMAZINGLY SMART OF INDUSTRIOUS GHONES
WHO SEEMED TOO MUCH OVERCOME TO DO ANYTHING BUT SIT WITH ITS MOUTH OPEN GAZING UP INTO THE ROOF OF THE COURT
HE KNOWS THE GLUGS QUITE WELL BY SIGHT YOU CAN NEVER MISTAKE THEM HE WILL SAY FOR THEY ALWAYS ACT IN A GLUGLIKE WAY AND THEY CLIMB THE TREES WHEN THE GLASS POINTS FAIR WITH CIRCUMSPECTION AND PROPER CARE
THERE WAS A GENERAL CLAPPING OF HANDS AT THIS IT WAS THE FIRST REALLY CLEVER THING THE KING HAD SAID THAT DAY THAT PROVES HIS GUILT SAID THE QUEEN IT PROVES NOTHING OF THE SORT SAID ALICE
WHO CLIMBED A TREE WHEN THE WEATHER WAS CALM AND THEY HANGED POOR JOI ON A SNUFFLEBUST PALM THEN THEY SANG A PSALM DID THOSE PIOUS GLUGS NEATH THE SNUFFLEBUST PALM AND EVERY BEE THAT KISSES A FLOW'R
THERE'S NO NAME SIGNED AT THE END IF YOU DIDN'T SIGN IT SAID THE KING THAT ONLY MAKES THE MATTER WORSE YOU MUST HAVE MEANT SOME MISCHIEF
WHENEVER A DEWDROP CLINGS TO A GOSSAMER THREAD AND GLITTERS AND SWINGS DEEP IN HUMILITY BOW YOUR HEAD TO A THING FOR A BLUNDERING RNORTAL'S DREAD AND THERE CAME TO SYM IN HIS LATER YOUTH WITH THE FIRST CLEAR GLANCE IN THE FACE OF GUILE
WE'RE GLUGS AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE THAT SO THEY CLIMBED THE TREES SINCE THE WEATHER WAS COLD WHILE THE BRAZEN BELL OF THE CITY TOLLED AND TOLLED AND TOLD THE FATE OF A GLUG WHO WAS OVER BOLD
YOU NEVER HAD FITS MY DEAR I THINK HE SAID TO THE QUEEN NEVER SAID THE QUEEN FURIOUSLY THROWING AN INKSTAND AT THE LIZARD AS SHE SPOKE THE UNFORTUNATE LITTLE BILL HAD LEFT OFF WRITING ON HIS SLATE WITH ONE FINGER
PARENTAL BLITHER SHE SAID QUITE FLAT HE'S AN AVERAGE GLUG AND HE'S RED AND FAT AND EXCEEDINGLY FAT AND RED AT THAT BUT THE FATHER JOI WHEN HE GAZED ON SYM DREAMED GREAT AND WONDERFUL THINGS FOR HIM
AND THE CHOKING OF THE SUPPRESSED GUINEA PIGS FILLED THE AIR MIXED UP WITH THE DISTANT SOBS OF THE MISERABLE MOCK TURTLE SO SHE SAT ON WITH CLOSED EYES AND HALF BELIEVED HERSELF IN WONDERLAND THOUGH SHE KNEW SHE HAD BUT TO OPEN THEM AGAIN
ALICE LOOKED AT THE JURY BOX AND SAW THAT IN HER HASTE
WELL I SHAN'T GO AT ANY RATE SAID ALICE BESIDES THAT'S NOT A REGULAR RULE YOU INVENTED IT JUST NOW IT'S THE OLDEST RULE IN THE BOOK SAID THE KING
THEN SUDDENLY STOPPED AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD YOU MAY LOOK UP THE REST IN A BOOK SAID HE AT PRESENT IT DOESN'T OCCUR TO ME BUT DO IT WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE AND NOW SAID THE TEACHER THE DAY'S TASK BRINGS CONSIDERATION OF PRACTICAL THINGS
IN HIS VEINS RAN BLOOD OF THAT STUPID RACE OF DOCILE FOLK WHO INHABIT THE PLACE CALLED GOSH SAD GOSH WHERE THE TALL TREES SIGH
THIS CLIMBING HABIT WAS OLD SO OLD THAT EVEN THE CHEESES COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHEN THE PAST GLUG PEOPLE FIRST BEGAN TO GIVE THEIR LIVES TO THE CLIMBING PLAN AND THE LEGEND RAN THAT THE ART WAS OLD AS THE MIND OF MAN AND EVEN THE MOUNTAINS OLD AND HOAR
HALF OF FRIGHT AND HALF OF ANGER AND TRIED TO BEAT THEM OFF AND FOUND HERSELF LYING ON THE BANK WITH HER HEAD IN THE LAP OF HER SISTER WHO WAS GENTLY BRUSHING AWAY SOME DEAD LEAVES THAT HAD FLUTTERED DOWN FROM THE TREES UPON HER FACE WAKE UP ALICE DEAR SAID HER SISTER
IF THERE'S NO MEANING IN IT SAID THE KING THAT SAVES A WORLD OF TROUBLE YOU KNOW AS WE NEEDN'T TRY TO FIND ANY AND YET I DON'T KNOW HE WENT ON SPREADING OUT THE VERSES ON HIS KNEE
SAID HE WHENEVER YOUR WONDERING EYES LOOK OUT ON THE GLORY OF EARTH AND SKIES SHALL YOU MID THE BLESSING OF FIELDS A BLOOM FLING BLAME AT THE BLIND MAN PRISONED IN GLOOM SO JOI HAD A SON
BUT THE PRACTICAL AUNT SAID FUDGE YOU FOOL WE'LL PACK UP HIS DINNER AND SEND HIM TO SCHOOL HE SHALL LEARN ABOUT TWO TIMES AND PARSING AND CAPES AND HOW TO MAKE MONEY WITH INCHES ON TAPES WE'LL APPRENTICE HIM THEN TO THE DRAPERY TRADE
THE STONES OF GOSH NOW HERE IS A TALE OF THE GLUGS OF GOSH AND A WONDERFUL TALE I WEEN OF THE GLUGS OF GOSH AND THEIR GREAT KING SPLOSH AND TUSH HIS VIRTUOUS QUEEN
THEN SPLOSH THE KING ROSE UP AND SAID IT'S NOT POLITE BUT HE'S SAFER DEAD AND THERE'S NOT MUCH ROOM IN THE LAND OF GOSH FOR A GLUG NAMED JOI AND A KING CALLED SPLOSH AND EVERY GLUG FLUNG HIGH HIS HAT AND CRIED
WHEN THE GREEN MOSS COVERS THOSE STONES YOU TREAD WHEN THE GREEN GRASS WHISPERS ABOVE MY HEAD MARK WELL WHEREVER YOUR PATH MAY TURN THEY HAVE REACHED THE VALLEY OF PEACE WHO LEARN THAT WISE HEARTS CHERISH WHAT FOOLS MAY SPURN
AND THE OGS WENT HOME WITH THEIR LOADS OF STONES WHICH THEY LANDED WITH GLEE IN THE LAND OF PODGE DO YOU NOTICE THE DODGE NOT YET DID THE GLUGS NOR THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE
ALICE COULD SEE THIS AS SHE WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO LOOK OVER THEIR SLATES BUT
THESE WERE THE VERSES THE WHITE RABBIT READ THEY TOLD ME YOU HAD BEEN TO HER AND MENTIONED ME TO HIM SHE GAVE ME A GOOD CHARACTER BUT SAID I COULD NOT SWIM HE SENT THEM WORD I HAD NOT GONE WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE
KNOW OF THEIR FOLLY WHO FEAR TO DIE NEW INTEREST CAME TO THE MIND OF SYM AS MIDST HIS FELLOWS HE LIVED AND TOILED BUT THE WAYS OF THE GLUG FOLK PUZZLED HIM FOR SOME WON HONOUR WHILE SOME WERE FOILED
WHY SUNLIGHT AND WORMS SAID THE LITTLE BLUE WREN SIX THE END OF JOI THEY CLIMBED THE TREES
AND TREATING FOES WITH THE CALM CONTEMPT OF THE ONE WHO KNOWS AND EVERY SPIDER WHO HEAVES A LINE AND TRUSTS TO HIS LUCK WHEN THE DAY IS FINE
WHEN THE AUNT RECOVERED SHE SCREAMED A TRAMP A LOW LIVED PILFERING IDLE SCAMP WHO STEALS PEOPLE'S WASHING AND SLEEPS IN THE DAMP SHARP TO THE HOUR SYM WAS READY AND DRESSED YOUNG BIRDS SIGHED THE FATHER MUST GO FROM THE NEST
SO SYM WENT OFF AND A YEAR RAN BY AND THE FATHER SAID WITH A SMILE MASKED SIGH IT IS MEET THAT THE YOUNG SHOULD LEAVE THE NEST SAID THE AUNT DON'T SPILL THAT SOUP ON YOUR VEST
AND ALL WOULD CHANGE TO DULL REALITY THE GRASS WOULD BE ONLY RUSTLING IN THE WIND AND THE POOL RIPPLING TO THE WAVING OF THE REEDS THE RATTLING TEACUPS WOULD CHANGE TO TINKLING SHEEP BELLS AND THE QUEEN'S SHRILL CRIES TO THE VOICE OF THE SHEPHERD BOY
IF ANY ONE OF THEM CAN EXPLAIN IT SAID ALICE
GODS OF THE GLOAMING WHO RIDE ON THE BREEZE STOOPING TO HEAFTEN THE BIRDS AND THE TREES BUT EACH DULL GLUG SITS DOWN BY HIS DOOR AND MUTTERS TIS WINDY AND NOTHING MORE LIKE THE LONG DEAD GLUGS IN THE DAYS OF YORE
HE UNFOLDED THE PAPER AS HE SPOKE AND ADDED IT ISN'T A LETTER AFTER ALL IT'S A SET OF VERSES ARE THEY IN THE PRISONER'S HANDWRITING ASKED ANOTHER OF THE JURYMEN NO THEY'RE NOT SAID THE WHITE RABBIT
FOR THEY FEAR TO TEAR THE VERY EXPENSIVE CLOTHES THEY WEAR BUT JOI WAS A GLUG WITH A TWISTED MIND OF THE NASTY MEDITATIVE KIND
THE LONG GRASS RUSTLED AT HER FEET AS THE WHITE RABBIT HURRIED BY THE FRIGHTENED MOUSE SPLASHED HIS WAY THROUGH THE NEIGHBOURING POOL SHE COULD HEAR THE RATTLE OF THE TEACUPS AS THE MARCH HARE AND HIS FRIENDS SHARED THEIR NEVER ENDING MEAL AND THE SHRILL VOICE OF THE QUEEN
HERE CRIED ALICE QUITE FORGETTING IN THE FLURRY OF THE MOMENT HOW LARGE SHE HAD GROWN IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES
BUT THE GLUGS CRIED DOWN WITH SUCH MEDDLESOME FOOLS WHAT DID OUR GRANDPAS LAY DOWN IN THEIR RULES AND THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE HE OPENED HIS BOOK TO CHEAPNESS HE SAID WAS THE ROAD THEY TOOK
LIE FLAT ON YOUR BACK ON THE GOOD GREEN EARTH AND ROAR TILL THE GREAT VAULT ECHOES YOUR MIRTH AS HE WALKED IN THE CITY TO SYM THERE CAME SOUNDS ENVENOMED WITH FEAR AND HATE
YET ALL WERE FILLED WITH A VAGUE UNREST AS THEY CLIMBED THEIR TREES IN AN ENDLESS SEARCH BUT JOI THE FATHER HE MOCKED THEIR QUEST WHEN HE MARKED A GLUG ON HIS HARD WON PERCH SAID HE
OH I BEG YOUR PARDON SHE EXCLAIMED IN A TONE OF GREAT DISMAY AND BEGAN PICKING THEM UP AGAIN AS QUICKLY AS SHE COULD FOR THE ACCIDENT OF THE GOLDFISH KEPT RUNNING IN HER HEAD AND SHE HAD A VAGUE SORT OF IDEA THAT THEY MUST BE COLLECTED AT ONCE AND PUT BACK INTO THE JURY BOX OR THEY WOULD DIE
AND LOOKED IN THE EYES OF THE QUESTING BOY SAID HE WHENEVER THE FIELDS ARE GREEN LIE STILL WHERE THE WILD ROSE FASHIONS A SCREEN
WHY WHAT A LONG SLEEP YOU'VE HAD OH I'VE HAD SUCH A CURIOUS DREAM SAID ALICE AND SHE TOLD HER SISTER AS WELL AS SHE COULD REMEMBER THEM
AND A STATUE OF SPLOSH AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS BUT A GLUG STOOD UP WITH A CAST IN HIS EYE AND HE SAID FAR TOO MANY BAUBLES WE BUY WITH ALL THE GOSH FACTORIES CLOSING THEIR DOORS AND IMPORTERS WAREHOUSES LINING OUR SHORES
THE GLUGS SHALL KNOW WHAT THE WILD THINGS KNOW SAID HE WHEREVER THE BROAD FIELDS SMILE THEY SHALL WALK WITH CLEAN MINDS FREE OF GUILE THEY SHALL SCOFF ALOUD AT THE CALL OF GREED AND TURN TO THEIR LABOURS AND NEVER HEED
SAID HIS AUNT LAWK A MUSSY WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE LAD HE ROMPS WITH THE PUPPIES AND TALKS TO THE ANTS AND KEEPS HIS LOOSE CHANGE IN HIS SECOND BEST PANTS AND STUMBLES ALL OVER MY CAULIFLOWER PLANTS THERE IS WISDOM IN THAT LAUGHED THE FATHER JOI
THIRST FOR KNOWLEDGE AND THOUGHTS OF TRUTH OF GILDED BAUBLES AND THINGS WORTH WHILE AND HE SAID THERE IS MUCH THAT A GLUG SHOULD KNOW BUT HIS MIND IS CLOUDED HIS YEARS ARE FEW
AND HOW SHE WOULD GATHER ABOUT HER OTHER LITTLE CHILDREN AND MAKE THEIR EYES BRIGHT AND EAGER WITH MANY A STRANGE TALE PERHAPS EVEN WITH THE DREAM OF WONDERLAND OF LONG AGO AND HOW SHE WOULD FEEL WITH ALL THEIR SIMPLE SORROWS
FOR ANY OLD GLUG IS LIKE THE REST AND THEY CLIMB THE TREES WHEN THERE'S WEATHER ABOUT IN A GENERAL WAY AS A CURE FOR GOUT THO SOME FOLKS DOUBT IF THE CLIMBING HABIT IS GOOD FOR GOUT SO JOI WAS HANGED AND HIS RACE WAS RUN
OH THE KING WAS RICH AND THE QUEEN WAS FAIR AND THEY MADE A VERY RESPECTABLE PAIR AND WHENEVER A GLUG IN THAT PEACEFUL LAND DID ANYTHING NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE HE LOOKED IN A BOOK AND CHARGED THAT GLUG WITH A CRIME CALLED CROOK
AND FREQUENTLY ASKED A DEPOSIT IN CASH THEN EVERY GLUG HE WENT HOME TO HIS REST WITH HIS HEAD IN A BAG AND HIS TOES TO THE WEST FOR THEY KNEW IT WAS BEST SINCE THEIR GRANDPAS SLEPT WITH THEIR TOES TO THE WEST
AND HERE IS A TALE OF THE CRAFTY OGS IN THEIR NEIGHBOURING LAND OF PODGE OF THEIR SAYINGS AND DOINGS AND PLOTTINGS AND BREWINGS AND SOMETHING ABOUT SIR STODGE WISE TO PROFUNDITY STOUT TO ROTUNDITY THAT WAS THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE
THAT SHE TIPPED OVER THE JURY BOX WITH THE EDGE OF HER SKIRT UPSETTING ALL THE JURYMEN ON TO THE HEADS OF THE CROWD BELOW AND THERE THEY LAY SPRAWLING ABOUT
I SEEM TO SEE SOME MEANING IN THEM AFTER ALL
RODS POLES OR PERCHES DERIVED FROM GREEK OH THE HAWTHORN BUDS CAME OUT THIS WEEK AND ROBINS ARE NESTING DOWN BY THE CREEK SO SYM WAS HEAD OF HIS CLASS NOT ONCE AND HIS AUNT REPEATEDLY DUBBED HIM DUNCE BUT
NOR YET DID THE GLUGS IN THEIR DREAMIEST DREAMS
AS SOON AS THE JURY HAD A LITTLE RECOVERED FROM THE SHOCK OF BEING UPSET AND THEIR SLATES AND PENCILS HAD BEEN FOUND AND HANDED BACK TO THEM THEY SET TO WORK VERY DILIGENTLY TO WRITE OUT A HISTORY OF THE ACCIDENT ALL EXCEPT THE LIZARD
SAID HE WHENEVER THE WEST WIND STIRS AND BIRDS IN FEATHERS AND BEASTS IN FURS STEAL OUT TO DANCE IN THE GLADE LIE STILL
AND KNOW WHAT THEY PROFIT WHO TRADE WITH HATE SAID HE WHENEVER THE GREAT SKIES SPREAD IN THE BECKONING VASTNESS OVERHEAD A TENT FOR THE BLUE WREN BUILDING A NEST THEN DOWN IN THE HEART OF YOU LEARN WHAT'S BEST
AND COPIES HIS WASHING BILL INTO A BOOK
WHERE I'VE HEARD IT REPORTED LARGE PROFITS ARE MADE BESIDES HE CAN SELL US CHEAP BUTTONS AND BRAID SO POOR YOUNG SYM HE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL WHERE THE FIRST THING TAUGHT IS THE GOLDEN RULE DO UNTO OTHERS THE TEACHER SAID
SO THE GLUGS CONTINUED WITH GREED AND GLEE TO BUY CHEAP CLOTHING AND PILLS AND TEA TILL EVERY GLUG IN THE LAND OF GOSH OWNED THREE CLEAN SHIRTS AND A FOURTH IN THE WASH BUT THEY ALL GREW IDLE AND FOND OF EASE AND EASY TO SWINDLE AND HARD TO PLEASE
WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU I GAVE HER ONE THEY GAVE HIM TWO YOU GAVE US THREE OR MORE THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU THOUGH THEY WERE MINE BEFORE IF I OR SHE SHOULD CHANCE TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AFFAIR
AND STOOPED TO A ROSE BUSH FLOWERING THERE SAID HE WHENEVER A BURSTING BLOOM LOOKS UP TO THE SUN MAY A SOUL FIND ROOM FOR A MEASURE OF AWE AT THE WONDROUS BIRTH OF ONE MORE TREASURE TO THIS GLAD EARTH SAID HE
HE WALKED IN THE WELCOMING FIELDS ALONE WHILE FROM FAR FAR AWAY CAME THE PEDAGOGUE'S DRONE IF A MAN MAKES MULTIPLY ABSTRACT NOUNS FROM B TAKE POPULATION OF TOWNS
LET'S STAY ON THE GROUND AND KILL KING SPLOSH BUT SPLOSH THE KING
AND THERE CAME TO SYM AS HE WALKED AFIELD DEEP THOUGHTS OF THE WORLD AND THE FOLK OF GOSH
RULE FORTY TWO ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT EVERYBODY LOOKED AT ALICE I'M NOT A MILE HIGH SAID ALICE YOU ARE SAID THE KING NEARLY TWO MILES HIGH ADDED THE QUEEN
SAID ALICE THE KING TURNED PALE AND SHUT HIS NOTE BOOK HASTILY CONSIDER YOUR VERDICT HE SAID TO THE JURY IN A LOW TREMBLING VOICE THERE'S MORE EVIDENCE TO COME YET PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE WHITE RABBIT JUMPING UP IN A GREAT HURRY
SHOUTS OF ANGER AND WORDS OF SHAME AS GLUG BLAMED GLUG FOR HIS WOEFUL STATE THIS BLAME SAID SYM IS IT MORTAL'S RIGHT TO BLAME HIS FELLOW FOR AUGHT HE BE
AND HIS PARENTS CLAIMS WERE A DEAL DENIED BY HIS MAIDEN AUNT ON HIS MOTHER'S SIDE
WE'LL SELL YOU PIANERS AND PICKELS AND SPANNERS FOR SEVENTEEN SHIPLOADS OF STONES SMOOTH UNS OR NOBBLY UNS FIRM UNS OR WOBBLY UNS ALL WE ASK IS STONES
AND THE VOICE OF JOI WAS A LONELY VOICE WHEN HE RAILED AT GOSH FOR ITS FOOLISH CHOICE BUT THE GREAT KING GRINNED AND THE GOOD QUEEN GUSHED AS THE GOODS OF THE OGS WERE MADLY RUSHED AND THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE WITH A WAVE OF HIS HAND
FOR WHY THEY SAY IN THE LAND OF GOSH THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO WILL BOW TO SPLOSH AND THEY CLIMB THE TREES WHEN THE RAIN PELTS DOWN AND FEEDS THE GUTTERS THAT THREAD THE TOWN FOR THEY FEAR TO DROWN WHEN FLOODS ARE FROTHY AND WATERS BROWN
STUFF AND NONSENSE SAID ALICE LOUDLY THE IDEA OF HAVING THE SENTENCE FIRST HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID THE QUEEN TURNING PURPLE I WON'T SAID ALICE OFF WITH HER HEAD
AND THE SNEEZE OF THE BABY THE SHRIEK OF THE GRYPHON AND ALL THE OTHER QUEER NOISES WOULD CHANGE SHE KNEW TO THE CONFUSED CLAMOUR OF THE BUSY FARM YARD WHILE THE LOWING OF THE CATTLE IN THE DISTANCE WOULD TAKE THE PLACE OF THE MOCK TURTLE'S HEAVY SOBS
AND THINKING OF LITTLE ALICE AND ALL HER WONDERFUL ADVENTURES TILL SHE TOO BEGAN DREAMING
THEY CLIMBED THE TREES TIS A BOOTLESS TASK TO SAY SO OVER AGAIN OR ASK THE CAUSE OF IT ALL OR THE REASON WHY THEY NEVER FELT HAPPIER UP ON HIGH FOR JOI ASKED WHY AND JOI WAS A FOOL AND NEVER A GLUG OF THE FINE OLD SCHOOL
BUT THE AUNT SAID TOITY AND DRAT THE BOY HE SHALL PLAY SAID THE FATHER SOME NOBLE PART WHO KNOWS BUT IT MAY BE IN LETTERS OR ART TIS A DIGNIFIED BUSINESS TO MAKE FOLK THINK BUT THE AUNT CRIED WHAT GO MESSING WITH INK AND SMEAR ALL HIS FINGERS AND TAKE TO DRINK
DECLARED IT A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS LAND
SAID HE IF THE MIND OF A GLUG COULD WAKE THEN OH WHAT A WONDERFUL GLUG HE'D MAKE WE SHALL TEACH THIS LADDIE TO PLAY LIFE'S GAME WITH A DIFFERENT MIND AND A DEFINITE AIM A GLUG IN APPEARANCE YET NOT THE SAME
HER SISTER KISSED HER AND SAID IT WAS A CURIOUS DREAM DEAR CERTAINLY
AH HE'S GETTING SENSE SAY THE ELDERLY FOLK BUT SYM
GIVE HIM A CHANCE SAID HIS FATHER JOI HIS HEAD IS ABNORMALLY LARGE FOR A BOY BUT HIS AUNT SAID PIFFIE IT'S CRAMMED WITH BOSH WHY HE DON'T KNOW THE RIVERS AND MOUNTAINS OF GOSH NOR THE NAMES OF THE NEPHEWS OF GOOD KING SPLOSH IN GOSH
BUT ALL OF THE TALE THAT IS SO FAR TOLD HAS NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH THE OGS OF PODGE AND THEIR CRAFTY DODGE AND THE TRADE IN PICKLES AND GLUE TO TRADE WITH THE GLUGS CAME THE OGS TO GOSH AND THEY SAID IN SEDUCTIVE TONES
AND THE KING SAID HUM AND THE QUEEN SAID O O THAT CURTAIN WHAT A BEE OOTIFUL BLUE BUT A GLUG STOOD UP WITH SOME VERY LARGE EARS AND SAID
NOBODY MOVED WHO CARES FOR YOU SAID ALICE SHE HAD GROWN TO HER FULL SIZE BY THIS TIME YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A PACK OF CARDS AT THIS THE WHOLE PACK ROSE UP INTO THE AIR AND CAME FLYING DOWN UPON HER SHE GAVE A LITTLE SCREAM
UNLESS IT WAS WRITTEN TO NOBODY WHICH ISN'T USUAL YOU KNOW WHO IS IT DIRECTED TO SAID ONE OF THE JURYMEN IT ISN'T DIRECTED AT ALL SAID THE WHITE RABBIT IN FACT THERE'S NOTHING WRITTEN ON THE OUTSIDE
IN THE FOLLOWING SUMMER THE OGS CAME BACK WITH A CARGO OF EIGHT DAY CLOCKS AND HAND PAINTED SCREENS AND SEWING MACHINES AND MANGLES AND SCISSORS AND SOCKS AND THEY SAID FOR THESE EXCELLENT THINGS WE BRING WE ARE READY TO TAKE MORE STONES
TO SPURN THE LAW OF THE KNIGHT SIR STODGE AND END THE RULE OF THE GREAT KING SPLOSH WHO SHALL WARN THE GLUGS OF THEIR CRAFTY DODGE AND AT LAST BRING PEACE SWEET PEACE TO GOSH
THERE THEY ARE SAID THE KING TRIUMPHANTLY POINTING TO THE TARTS ON THE TABLE NOTHING CAN BE CLEARER THAN THAT THEN AGAIN
THE TRIAL CANNOT PROCEED SAID THE KING IN A VERY GRAVE VOICE UNTIL ALL THE JURYMEN ARE BACK IN THEIR PROPER PLACES ALL HE REPEATED WITH GREAT EMPHASIS LOOKING HARD AT ALICE
WITH BUTTONS AND HOOKS AND MEDICAL BOOKS AND ROTARY ENGINES AND RUM LARGE CASES WITH LABELS OCCASIONAL TABLES HAIR TONIC AND FIDDLES AND PHONES AND THE GLUGS WHILE COPNCEALING THEIR JOY IN THE DEALING PAID PROMPTLY IN NOTHING BUT STONES
HE OPENED HIS BOOK NO TAX SAID HE WHEREVER I LOOK THEN THEY FINED THE GLUG WITH THE PROMINENT EARS FOR BEING OLD FASHIONED BY SEVERAL YEARS AND THE OGS WENT HOME WITH THE STONES FULL STEAM DID YOU NOTICE THE SCHEME
AND EVERY BLOSSOM BORN FOR AN HOUR AND EVERY BIRD ON ITS GLADSOME FLIGHT ALL KNOW THE GLUGS QUITE WELL BY SIGHT FOR THEY SAY TIS A SIMPLE TEST WE'VE GOT IF YOU KNOW ONE GLUG WHY YOU KNOW THE LOT
WHY IT WAS SCREAMINGLY LAUGHABLE SEEMINGLY ASKING FOR NOTHING BUT STONES AND THE KING SAID HAW AND THE QUEEN SAID OH OUR DRAWING ROOM NOW IS A HEAVENLY SHOW OF LARGE OVERMANTELS AND WHATNOTS AND CHAIRS
PAINT HUSSIES AND COWS AND END IN THE CLINK SO THE ARGUMENT RAN BUT ONE BRIGHT SPRING DAY SYM SETTLED IT ALL IN HIS OWN STRANGE WAY TIS A TRAMP HE ANNOUNCED I'VE DECIDED TO BE AND I START NEXT MONDAY AT TWENTY TO THREE
THEY WERE JUST BEGINNING TO WRITE THIS DOWN ON THEIR SLATES WHEN THE WHITE RABBIT INTERRUPTED
READ THEM SAID THE KING THE WHITE RABBIT PUT ON HIS SPECTACLES WHERE SHALL I BEGIN PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY HE ASKED BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING THE KING SAID GRAVELY AND GO ON TILL YOU COME TO THE END THEN STOP
DON'T LET HIM KNOW SHE LIKED THEM BEST FOR THIS MUST EVER BE A SECRET KEPT FROM ALL THE REST BETWEEN YOURSELF AND ME THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF EVIDENCE WE'VE HEARD YET SAID THE KING RUBBING HIS HANDS
SO ALICE GOT UP AND RAN OFF THINKING WHILE SHE RAN AS WELL SHE MIGHT WHAT A WONDERFUL DREAM IT HAD BEEN BUT HER SISTER SAT STILL JUST AS SHE LEFT HER LEANING HER HEAD ON HER HAND
THAT SHE WASN'T A BIT AFRAID OF INTERRUPTING HIM I'LL GIVE HIM SIXPENCE I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S AN ATOM OF MEANING IN IT THE JURY ALL WROTE DOWN ON THEIR SLATES SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE THERE'S AN ATOM OF MEANING IN IT BUT NONE OF THEM ATTEMPTED TO EXPLAIN THE PAPER
AND EVERY CLOUD THAT SAILS THE BLUE AND EVERY DANCING SUNBEAM TOO AND EVERY SPARKLING DEWDROP BRIGHT ALL KNOW THE GLUGS QUITE WELL BY SIGHT WE TELL SAY THEY
AND THE GLUGS WERE TICKLED WITH WHAT THEY'D DONE AND AFTER THAT IF A DAY SHOULD COME WHEN A GLUG FELT EXTRA SPECIALLY GLUM HE'D CALL HIS CHILDREN AROUND HIS KNEE AND TELL THAT TALE WITH A CHUCKLE OF GLEE AND SHOULD A LITTLE GLUG GIRL OR BOY SEE NAUGHT OF A JOKE IN THE FATE OF JOI
BUT UNDER A HEDGE BY A FLOWERING PEACH A YOUTH WITH A LITTLE BLUE WREN HELD SPEECH WITH HIS BACK TO A TREE AND HIS FEET IN THE GRASS
WHENEVER THESE TALES ARE HEARD OF THE FEASIBLE DOG OR THE GUFFER BIRD THEN LAUGH AND LAUGH TILL THE FAT TEARS ROLL TO THE ROOTS OF THE JOY BUSH DEEP IN YOUR SOUL WHEN YOU SEE THEM SQUAT ON THE TREE TOPS HIGH SCANNING FOR EVER THAT HEEDLESS SKY
ORDERING OFF HER UNFORTUNATE GUESTS TO EXECUTION ONCE MORE THE PIG BABY WAS SNEEZING ON THE DUCHESS'S KNEE WHILE PLATES AND DISHES CRASHED AROUND IT ONCE MORE THE SHRIEK OF THE GRYPHON THE SQUEAKING OF THE LIZARD'S SLATE PENCIL
IF A MAN MAKES A PROFIT OF FIFTEEN POUNDS ON ONE WEEK'S TAKINGS FROM TWO MILK ROUNDS HOW MANY AND SYM WENT DREAMING AWAY TO THE SUNLIT LANDS WHERE THE FIELD MICE PLAY
UNTIL I BEGAN TO THINK OF FOOD AND DRINK
AND IF JACK AND I CHOOSE TO HAVE A QUICK RUN NOW AND THEN TO PLEASE OURSELVES THAT'S OUR BUSINESS AND NOT YOURS WELL SAID LARRY YOU'LL NEVER BE A RICH MAN MOST LIKELY NOT SAID JERRY
AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR I HEARD MONTGOMERY SHOUTING MY NAME FAR AWAY TO THE NORTH THAT SET ME THINKING OF MY PLAN OF ACTION AS I INTERPRETED IT THEN
HE MADE A SWIFT MOVEMENT AND VANISHED THE FERN FRONDS HE HAD STOOD BETWEEN CAME SWISHING TOGETHER I PUSHED OUT OF THE BRAKE AFTER HIM AND WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND HIM SWINGING CHEERFULLY BY ONE LANK ARM
AND MANAGE TO GET TO THE FRONT GOING SO NEAR THE WHEELS ON EACH SIDE THAT HALF AN INCH NEARER AND THEY WOULD SCRAPE WELL YOU GET ALONG FOR A BIT BUT SOON FIND YOURSELF IN A LONG TRAIN OF CARTS AND CARRIAGES ALL OBLIGED TO GO AT A WALK
AT LENGTH THE ROOTS DECAY AND THE FORLORN GRAY TRUNKS ARE BLOWN DOWN DURING SOME STORM AND PILED ONE UPON ANOTHER ENCUMBERING THE GROUND UNTIL DRY AND SEASONED THEY ARE CONSUMED BY ANOTHER FIRE AND LEAVE THE GROUND READY FOR A FRESH CROP
ANOTHER ON THE SAME RIDGE ONLY ONE FOOT SEVEN AND A HALF INCHES IN DIAMETER HAD REACHED THE AGE OF EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR YEARS THE FIRST FIFTEEN INCHES FROM THE BARK OF A MEDIUM SIZE TREE SIX FEET IN DIAMETER ON THE NORTH TENAYA PAVEMENT
WITH THE BRANCHES ON BUT PEELED AND RIGID APPEARING GRAY IN THE DISTANCE LIKE MISTY CLOUDS LATER THE BRANCHES DROP OFF LEAVING A FOREST OF BLEACHED SPARS
AND BE QUICK AS A RAT DOG TO SEE IF THERE BE ROOM AND IF THERE BE TIME LEST YOU GET YOUR OWN WHEELS LOCKED OR SMASHED OR THE SHAFT OF SOME OTHER VEHICLE RUN INTO YOUR CHEST OR SHOULDER ALL THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR
YOU SHALL HAVE A SHILLING EXTRA I WILL TAKE YOU AT THE REGULAR PACE GENTLEMEN SHILLINGS DON'T PAY FOR PUTTING ON THE STEAM LIKE THAT LARRY'S CAB WAS STANDING NEXT TO OURS HE FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND SAID
ITS FINE COLOR AND PICTURESQUENESS ARE APPRECIATED BY ARTISTS BUT TO ME THE JUNIPER SEEMS A SINGULARLY STRANGE AND TACITURN TREE I HAVE SPENT MANY A DAY AND NIGHT IN ITS COMPANY
THAT I THINK WOULD MAKE ME FEEL RATHER QUEER IF I WAS ONE OF THEM IF YOU EVER DO GET RICH SAID GOVERNOR GRAY LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER ACROSS THE TOP OF HIS CAB YOU'LL DESERVE IT JERRY
IT IS AS MASSIVE AND SUGGESTIVE OF ENDURING STRENGTH AS AN OAK ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE TRUNK IS COMMONLY FREE OF LIMBS BUT CLOSE FRINGY TUFTS OF SPRAY OCCUR NEARLY ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND
HE SET OFF AS HARD AS HE COULD JERRY PATTED ME ON THE NECK NO JACK A SHILLING WOULD NOT PAY FOR THAT SORT OF THING WOULD IT OLD BOY ALTHOUGH JERRY WAS DETERMINEDLY SET AGAINST HARD DRIVING
I SAW THE LEVEL BLUE OF THE SEA THE PATH COILED DOWN ABRUPTLY INTO A NARROW RAVINE BETWEEN TWO TUMBLED AND KNOTTY MASSES OF BLACKISH SCORIAE INTO THIS WE PLUNGED IT WAS EXTREMELY DARK THIS PASSAGE
MY CHEST STRAINING MY HEART BEATING IN MY EARS AND THEN HEARING NOTHING OF MONTGOMERY OR HIS MAN AND FEELING UPON THE VERGE OF EXHAUSTION I DOUBLED SHARPLY BACK TOWARDS THE BEACH AS I JUDGED AND LAY DOWN IN THE SHELTER OF A CANEBRAKE
PERHAPS YOU COME TO A REGULAR BLOCK UP AND HAVE TO STAND STILL FOR MINUTES TOGETHER TILL SOMETHING CLEARS OUT INTO A SIDE STREET OR THE POLICEMAN INTERFERES YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR ANY CHANCE TO DASH FORWARD IF THERE BE AN OPENING
WITHOUT ANY STRIKING EFFECT EXCEPT WHILE VERY YOUNG WHEN THE FLOWERS ARE OF A VIVID CRIMSON COLOR AND THE WHOLE TREE APPEARS TO BE DOTTED WITH BRILLIANT FLOWERS THE STAMINATE FLOWERS ARE STILL MORE SHOWY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR GREAT ABUNDANCE
WADING UP THE CREEK AND PRESENTLY FINDING MYSELF KNEEDEEP IN A LITTLE STREAM I SCRAMBLED OUT AT LAST ON THE WESTWARD BANK AND WITH MY HEART BEATING LOUDLY IN MY EARS CREPT INTO A TANGLE OF FERNS TO AWAIT THE ISSUE I HEARD THE DOG
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I SHALL BE THE LESS HAPPY FOR THAT I HAVE HEARD THE COMMANDMENTS READ A GREAT MANY TIMES AND I NEVER NOTICED THAT ANY OF THEM SAID THOU SHALT BE RICH AND THERE ARE A GOOD MANY CURIOUS THINGS SAID IN THE NEW TESTAMENT ABOUT RICH MEN
OFTEN GIVING A REDDISH YELLOW TINGE TO THE WHOLE MASS OF FOLIAGE AND FILLING THE AIR WITH POLLEN NO OTHER PINE ON THE RANGE IS SO REGULARLY PLANTED AS THIS ONE COVERING MORAINES THAT EXTEND ALONG THE SIDES OF THE HIGH ROCKY VALLEYS FOR MILES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN ON THIS ISLAND SAID I HOW LONG HE ASKED AND AFTER HAVING THE QUESTION REPEATED HE HELD UP THREE FINGERS THE CREATURE WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN AN IDIOT
DRAW NEARER AND YELP WHEN IT CAME TO THE THORNS THEN I HEARD NO MORE AND PRESENTLY BEGAN TO THINK I HAD ESCAPED THE MINUTES PASSED THE SILENCE LENGTHENED OUT AND AT LAST AFTER AN HOUR OF SECURITY MY COURAGE BEGAN TO RETURN TO ME
TO SEND ME OFF A LOST SOUL A BEAST TO THE REST OF THEIR COMUS ROUT I LOOKED ROUND FOR SOME WEAPON NOTHING THEN WITH AN INSPIRATION I TURNED OVER THE DECK CHAIR PUT MY FOOT ON THE SIDE OF IT
I KNEW NO WAY OF GETTING ANYTHING TO EAT I WAS TOO IGNORANT OF BOTANY TO DISCOVER ANY RESORT OF ROOT OR FRUIT THAT MIGHT LIE ABOUT ME I HAD NO MEANS OF TRAPPING THE FEW RABBITS UPON THE ISLAND
SOME ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD FOR THOUGH ON DEEP MORAINE SOIL THEY GROW ABOUT AS FAST AS SOME OF THE PINES ON BARE PAVEMENTS AND SMOOTHLY GLACIATED OVERSWEPT RIDGES IN THE DOME REGION THEY GROW VERY SLOWLY
BUT SNATCHING UP MY NAILED STICK RUSHED HEADLONG FROM MY HIDING PLACE TOWARDS THE SOUND OF THE SEA I REMEMBER A GROWTH OF THORNY PLANTS WITH SPINES THAT STABBED LIKE PEN KNIVES I EMERGED BLEEDING AND WITH TORN CLOTHES UPON THE LIP OF A LONG CREEK OPENING NORTHWARD
ALIVE OR DEAD AS IS DOES OVER A GLACIER BOULDER I HAVE SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME TRYING TO DETERMINE THE AGE OF THESE WONDERFUL TREES BUT AS ALL OF THE VERY OLD ONES ARE HONEY COMBED WITH DRY ROT I NEVER WAS ABLE TO GET A COMPLETE COUNT OF THE LARGEST
IF YOU WANT TO GET THROUGH LONDON FAST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IT WANTS A DEAL OF PRACTICE JERRY AND I WERE USED TO IT AND NO ONE COULD BEAT US AT GETTING THROUGH WHEN WE WERE SET UPON IT I WAS QUICK AND BOLD
CLINGING BY SLIGHT JOINTS TO THE ROCKS LIVING CHIEFLY ON SNOW AND THIN AIR AND MAINTAINING SOUND HEALTH ON THIS DIET FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE EVERY FEATURE OR EVERY GESTURE IT MAKES EXPRESSES STEADFAST DOGGED ENDURANCE
I TRIED TO MAKE OUT WHAT HE MEANT BY THAT AND IT SEEMS I BORED HIM AFTER ANOTHER QUESTION OR TWO
CAN YOU TAKE ME TO THE SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY SAID THE YOUNG MAN THIS UNLUCKY FALL HAS MADE ME LATE I FEAR BUT IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT I SHOULD NOT LOSE THE TWELVE O'CLOCK TRAIN I SHOULD BE MOST THANKFUL IF YOU COULD GET ME THERE IN TIME
JERRY BARKER I NEVER KNEW A BETTER MAN THAN MY NEW MASTER HE WAS KIND AND GOOD AND AS STRONG FOR THE RIGHT AS JOHN MANLY AND SO GOOD TEMPERED AND MERRY THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE COULD PICK A QUARREL WITH HIM
COME ALONG SAID HE I WENT WITH HIM TO SEE THE ADVENTURE OUT I GUESSED THE HUTS WERE SOME ROUGH SHELTER WHERE HE AND SOME MORE OF THESE BEAST PEOPLE LIVED I MIGHT PERHAPS FIND THEM FRIENDLY
GROWING IN BEAUTIFUL ORDER ON MORAINES SCARCELY CHANGED AS YET BY POST GLACIAL WEATHERING COMPARED WITH THE GIANTS OF THE LOWER REGIONS THIS IS A SMALL TREE SELDOM EXCEEDING A HEIGHT OF EIGHTY OR NINETY FEET
SO GLAD WE HIT THE TIME SIR BUT DON'T STAY NOW SIR THE BELL IS RINGING HERE PORTER TAKE THIS GENTLEMAN'S LUGGAGE DOVER LINE TWELVE O'CLOCK TRAIN THAT'S IT AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANOTHER WORD
SINGLY IN WHAT APPEARS AS CHANCE SITUATIONS WITHOUT MAKING MUCH IMPRESSION ON THE GENERAL FOREST CONTINUING UP THROUGH THE FORESTS OF THE TWO LEAVED PINE IT BEGINS TO SHOW ITS DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC IN THE MOST MARKED WAY
IT GREW BLANKER THE MORE I TURNED THE PROSPECT OVER AT LAST IN THE DESPERATION OF MY POSITION MY MIND TURNED TO THE ANIMAL MEN I HAD ENCOUNTERED I TRIED TO FIND SOME HOPE IN WHAT I REMEMBERED OF THEM
AND DREW UP ON ONE SIDE TILL THE CRUSH WAS PAST SO GLAD HE SAID SO GLAD POOR YOUNG FELLOW I WONDER WHAT IT WAS THAT MADE HIM SO ANXIOUS JERRY OFTEN TALKED TO HIMSELF QUITE LOUD ENOUGH FOR ME TO HEAR
YOU HE SAID IN THE BOAT HE WAS A MAN THEN AT LEAST AS MUCH OF A MAN AS MONTGOMERY'S ATTENDANT FOR HE COULD TALK YES I SAID I CAME IN THE BOAT FROM THE SHIP OH HE SAID
AND HIS BRIGHT RESTLESS EYES TRAVELLED OVER ME TO MY HANDS TO THE STICK I CARRIED TO MY FEET TO THE TATTERED PLACES IN MY COAT AND THE CUTS AND SCRATCHES I HAD RECEIVED FROM THE THORNS HE SEEMED PUZZLED AT SOMETHING HIS EYES CAME BACK TO MY HANDS
DECORATED WITH A FEW LEAFY SPRAYS REMINDING ONE OF THE CRUMBLING TOWERS OF OLD CASTLES SCANTILY DRAPED WITH IVY ITS HOMES ON BARE BARREN DOME AND RIDGE TOP SEEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN FOR SAFETY AGAINST FIRE
I REMEMBERED THAT IF I WERE TOO HARD PRESSED AT LEAST ONE PATH OF ESCAPE FROM TORMENT STILL LAY OPEN TO ME
AND COULD ALWAYS TRUST MY DRIVER JERRY WAS QUICK AND PATIENT AT THE SAME TIME AND COULD TRUST HIS HORSE WHICH WAS A GREAT THING TOO HE VERY SELDOM USED THE WHIP I KNEW BY HIS VOICE AND HIS CLICK CLICK WHEN HE WANTED TO GET ON FAST
I STRETCHED MY LIMBS SORE AND PAINFUL FROM THE PRICKS OF THE SPINY PLANTS AND STARED AROUND ME AT THE TREES
THIS ISLAND WAS INHABITED ONLY BY THESE TWO VIVISECTORS AND THEIR ANIMALISED VICTIMS SOME OF THESE NO DOUBT THEY COULD PRESS INTO THEIR SERVICE AGAINST ME IF NEED AROSE I KNEW BOTH MOREAU AND MONTGOMERY CARRIED REVOLVERS
AND AS READY AS A HOSPITAL RABBIT FOR MY FATE HE EMERGED BEHIND THE CORNER FOR I HEARD HIM SHOUT PRENDICK THEN HE BEGAN TO RUN AFTER ME SHOUTING THINGS AS HE RAN THIS TIME RUNNING BLINDLY
THE SHORT RIGID NEEDLES IN FASCICLES OF TWO ARE ARRANGED IN COMPARATIVELY LONG CYLINDRICAL TASSELS AT THE ENDS OF THE TOUGH UP CURVING BRANCHES THE CONES ARE ABOUT TWO INCHES LONG GROWING IN CLUSTERS AMONG THE NEEDLES
AND A GOOD HORSE WHO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER ARE OF ONE MIND IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT THEY CAN DO I HAD A VERY GOOD MOUTH THAT IS I COULD BE GUIDED BY THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF THE REIN AND THAT IS A GREAT THING IN LONDON
THAT MOREAU HAD BEEN VIVISECTING A HUMAN BEING ALL THE TIME SINCE I HAD HEARD HIS NAME I HAD BEEN TRYING TO LINK IN MY MIND IN SOME WAY THE GROTESQUE ANIMALISM OF THE ISLANDERS WITH HIS ABOMINATIONS AND NOW I THOUGHT I SAW IT ALL
THE THIN BARK IS STREAKED AND SPRINKLED WITH RESIN AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SHOWERED UPON THE FOREST LIKE RAIN THEREFORE THIS TREE MORE THAN ANY OTHER IS SUBJECT TO DESTRUCTION BY FIRE DURING STRONG WINDS EXTENSIVE FORESTS ARE DESTROYED
AFTER THE BLINDING SUNLIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE SULPHUROUS GROUND
HE WAS VERY FOND OF MAKING LITTLE SONGS AND SINGING THEM TO HIMSELF ONE HE WAS VERY FOND OF WAS THIS COME FATHER AND MOTHER AND SISTER AND BROTHER COME ALL OF YOU TURN TO AND HELP ONE ANOTHER
THE HUNTING OF THE MAN IT CAME BEFORE MY MIND WITH AN UNREASONABLE HOPE OF ESCAPE THAT THE OUTER DOOR OF MY ROOM WAS STILL OPEN TO ME I WAS CONVINCED NOW ABSOLUTELY ASSURED
WHERE CAN I GET SOMETHING TO EAT EAT HE SAID EAT MAN'S FOOD NOW
ON TREES THAT OCCUPY EXPOSED SITUATIONS NEAR ITS UPPER LIMIT THE BARK IS DEEP REDDISH BROWN AND RATHER DEEPLY FURROWED THE MAIN FURROWS RUNNING NEARLY PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER AND CONNECTED ON THE OLD TREES BY CONSPICUOUS CROSS FURROWS
ABOVE THE SILVER FIR ZONE FORMS THE BULK OF THE ALPINE FORESTS UP TO A HEIGHT OF FROM EIGHT THOUSAND
BENDING ALL TOGETHER TO THE BREEZE AND WHIRLING IN EDDYING GUSTS MORE LIVELY THAN ANY OTHER TREE IN THE WOODS I FREQUENTLY FOUND SPECIMENS FIFTY FEET HIGH LESS THAN FIVE INCHES IN DIAMETER BEING SO SLENDER AND AT THE SAME TIME CLAD WITH LEAFY BOUGHS
FIND SOME HANDLE IN THEIR MINDS TO TAKE HOLD OF
THE LOWER LIMBS LIKE THOSE OF MOST OTHER CONIFERS THAT GROW IN SNOWY REGIONS CURVE DOWNWARD GRADUALLY TAKE A HORIZONTAL POSITION ABOUT HALF WAY UP THE TRUNK THEN ASPIRE MORE AND MORE TOWARD THE SUMMIT
FROM A ROPE OF CREEPERS THAT LOOPED DOWN FROM THE FOLIAGE OVERHEAD HIS BACK WAS TO ME HULLO SAID I HE CAME DOWN WITH A TWISTING JUMP AND STOOD FACING ME I SAY SAID I
THE TWO LEAVED PINE THE TWO LEAVED PINE PINUS CONTORTA
GOOD LUCK IS RATHER PARTICULAR WHO SHE RIDES WITH AND MOSTLY PREFERS THOSE WHO HAVE GOT COMMON SENSE AND A GOOD HEART AT LEAST THAT IS MY EXPERIENCE GOVERNOR GRAY TURNED ROUND AGAIN TO HIS NEWSPAPER
HAD EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY NINE LAYERS OF WOOD BEYOND THIS THE COUNT WAS STOPPED BY DRY ROT AND SCARS THE LARGEST EXAMINED WAS THIRTY THREE FEET IN GIRTH OR NEARLY TEN FEET IN DIAMETER AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE FAILED TO GET ANYTHING LIKE A COMPLETE COUNT
AND TORE AWAY THE SIDE RAIL IT HAPPENED THAT A NAIL CAME AWAY WITH THE WOOD AND PROJECTING GAVE A TOUCH OF DANGER TO AN OTHERWISE PETTY WEAPON
IT IS OFTEN BENT AND WEIGHED DOWN TO THE GROUND WHEN LADEN WITH SOFT SNOW THUS FORMING FINE ORNAMENTAL ARCHES MANY OF THEM TO LAST UNTIL THE MELTING OF THE SNOW IN THE SPRING THE MOUNTAIN PINE
A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN I GENERALLY GET SAID HE NODDING SLYLY WHAT HE GAVE ME WILL KEEP ME IN LITTLE COMFORTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS GAMMON SAID ONE HE'S A HUMBUG SAID ANOTHER
JUST WHERE OTHER SPECIES BEGIN TO CROUCH AND DISAPPEAR AT ITS BEST IT IS USUALLY ABOUT NINETY FEET HIGH AND FIVE OR SIX FEET IN DIAMETER THOUGH YOU MAY FIND SPECIMENS HERE AND THERE CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THIS
MY APE LIKE COMPANION TROTTED ALONG BY MY SIDE WITH HIS HANDS HANGING DOWN AND HIS JAW THRUST FORWARD
ONE ON THE STARR KING RIDGE ONLY TWO FEET ELEVEN INCHES IN DIAMETER
BLOTCHES OF GREEN AND CRIMSON DRIFTED ACROSS MY EYES MY CONDUCTOR STOPPED SUDDENLY HOME SAID HE AND I STOOD IN A FLOOR OF A CHASM THAT WAS AT FIRST ABSOLUTELY DARK TO ME
THE CONES ARE FROM FOUR TO EIGHT INCHES LONG SMOOTH SLENDER CYLINDRICAL AND SOMEWHAT CURVED THEY GROW IN CLUSTERS OF FROM THREE TO SIX OR SEVEN AND BECOME PENDULOUS AS THEY INCREASE IN WEIGHT
PLEASE TO OPEN THE DOOR AND LET US LOSE NO TIME THE NEXT MINUTE JERRY WAS ON THE BOX WITH A CHEERY CHIRRUP TO ME AND A TWITCH OF THE REIN THAT I WELL UNDERSTOOD NOW THEN JACK MY BOY SAID HE SPIN ALONG
INCREASING IN VELOCITY AND DRAGGING THE FLAMES UPWARD THEN THE LEAVES CATCH FORMING AN IMMENSE COLUMN OF FIRE BEAUTIFULLY SPIRED ON THE EDGES AND TINTED A ROSE PURPLE HUE IT RUSHES ALOFT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET ABOVE THE TOP OF THE TREE
AND FOUND MONTGOMERY WITHIN A YARD OF IT HE MEANT TO LOCK THE OUTER DOOR I RAISED THIS NAILED STICK OF MINE AND CUT AT HIS FACE BUT HE SPRANG BACK I HESITATED A MOMENT THEN TURNED AND FLED ROUND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE
HE BEGAN CHATTERING YOU YOU YOU WAS ALL I COULD DISTINGUISH AT FIRST SUDDENLY HE DROPPED FROM THE TREE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT WAS HOLDING THE FRONDS APART AND STARING CURIOUSLY AT ME
AND AS THEY LED HIM INTO A SHOP HE WALKED AS IF HE WERE IN GREAT PAIN JERRY OF COURSE CAME BACK TO THE STAND BUT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES ONE OF THE SHOPMEN CALLED HIM
I HEARD SOME STRANGE NOISES AND THRUST THE KNUCKLES OF MY LEFT HAND INTO MY EYES I BECAME AWARE OF A DISAGREEABLE ODOR LIKE THAT OF A MONKEY'S CAGE ILL CLEANED BEYOND THE ROCK OPENED AGAIN UPON A GRADUAL SLOPE OF SUNLIT GREENERY
OMNIBUSES CARTS VANS TRUCKS CABS AND GREAT WAGONS CREEPING ALONG AT A WALKING PACE SOME GOING ONE WAY SOME ANOTHER SOME GOING SLOWLY OTHERS WANTING TO PASS THEM OMNIBUSES STOPPING SHORT EVERY FEW MINUTES TO TAKE UP A PASSENGER
THESE CREATURES I HAD SEEN WERE THE VICTIMS OF SOME HIDEOUS EXPERIMENT THESE SICKENING SCOUNDRELS HAD MERELY INTENDED TO KEEP ME BACK TO FOOL ME WITH THEIR DISPLAY OF CONFIDENCE AND PRESENTLY TO FALL UPON ME WITH A FATE MORE HORRIBLE THAN DEATH
I WENT NORTHEASTWARD IN A DIRECTION AT RIGHT ANGLES TO MY PREVIOUS EXPEDITION ONCE AS I WENT RUNNING HEADLONG UP THE BEACH I GLANCED OVER MY SHOULDER AND SAW HIS ATTENDANT WITH HIM I RAN FURIOUSLY UP THE SLOPE OVER IT
FOR THERE WAS A WHOLE TRAIN OF CABS AND CARRIAGES ALL GOING OUR WAY AT A QUICK TROT PERHAPS WANTING TO CATCH THAT VERY TRAIN AT ANY RATE WE WHIRLED INTO THE STATION WITH MANY MORE JUST AS THE GREAT CLOCK POINTED TO EIGHT MINUTES TO TWELVE O'CLOCK
AND SO TO A BARE PLACE COVERED WITH A YELLOW WHITE INCRUSTATION
THE WESTERN JUNIPER THE JUNIPER OR RED CEDAR JUNIPERUS OCCIDENTALIS IS PREEMINENTLY A ROCK TREE
HE COULD NOT BEAR ANY CARELESS LOITERING AND WASTE OF TIME AND NOTHING WAS SO NEAR MAKING HIM ANGRY AS TO FIND PEOPLE WHO WERE ALWAYS LATE WANTING A CAB HORSE TO BE DRIVEN HARD TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR IDLENESS
I HAD HALF A MIND TO DROWN MYSELF THEN BUT AN ODD WISH TO SEE THE WHOLE ADVENTURE OUT A QUEER IMPERSONAL SPECTACULAR INTEREST IN MYSELF RESTRAINED ME
AND THE ONLY SOUND NEAR ME WAS THE THIN HUM OF SOME SMALL GNATS THAT HAD DISCOVERED ME PRESENTLY I BECAME AWARE OF A DROWSY BREATHING SOUND
OCCUPYING THE BALDEST DOMES AND PAVEMENTS IN THE UPPER SILVER FIR AND ALPINE ZONES
AND YOU WON'T FIND A CURSE COME WITH YOUR WEALTH AS FOR YOU LARRY YOU'LL DIE POOR YOU SPEND TOO MUCH IN WHIPCORD WELL SAID LARRY WHAT IS A FELLOW TO DO IF HIS HORSE WON'T GO WITHOUT IT
WITH TORTURE AND AFTER TORTURE
AND SO THEY DID HARRY WAS AS CLEVER AT STABLE WORK AS A MUCH OLDER BOY AND ALWAYS WANTED TO DO WHAT HE COULD THEN POLLY AND DOLLY USED TO COME IN THE MORNING TO HELP WITH THE CAB TO BRUSH AND BEAT THE CUSHIONS
THERE I REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME TOO FEARFUL TO MOVE AND INDEED TOO FEARFUL EVEN TO PLAN A COURSE OF ACTION THE WILD SCENE ABOUT ME LAY SLEEPING SILENTLY UNDER THE SUN
AFTERWARDS I WAS TO FIND THAT A GREAT PROPORTION OF THESE BEAST PEOPLE HAD MALFORMED HANDS LACKING SOMETIMES EVEN THREE DIGITS BUT GUESSING THIS WAS IN SOME WAY A GREETING I DID THE SAME THING BY WAY OF REPLY HE GRINNED WITH IMMENSE SATISFACTION
IN SUCH SITUATIONS ROOTED IN NARROW CRACKS OR FISSURES WHERE THERE IS SCARCELY A HANDFUL OF SOIL IT IS FREQUENTLY OVER EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER AND NOT MUCH MORE IN HEIGHT THE TOPS OF OLD TREES ARE ALMOST ALWAYS DEAD
IT IS A WELL PROPORTIONED RATHER HANDSOME TREE WITH GRAYISH BROWN BARK AND CROOKED MUCH DIVIDED BRANCHES WHICH COVER THE GREATER PART OF THE TRUNK BUT NOT SO DENSELY AS TO PREVENT IT BEING SEEN
THIS SPECIES IS NEARLY RELATED TO THE SUGAR PINE AND THOUGH NOT HALF SO TALL IT SUGGESTS ITS NOBLE RELATIVE IN THE WAY THAT IT EXTENDS ITS LONG BRANCHES IN GENERAL HABIT IT IS FIRST MET ON THE UPPER MARGIN OF THE SILVER FIR ZONE
WITH SCARCE A TRACE OF THE ROCKY ANGULARITY AND BROKEN LIMBS SO CHARACTERISTIC A FEATURE THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF ITS RANGE IT NEVER MAKES ANYTHING LIKE A FOREST SELDOM EVEN A GROVE USUALLY IT STANDS OUT SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT
THE FLAMES LEAPING FROM TREE TO TREE IN CONTINUOUS BELTS THAT GO SURGING AND RACING ONWARD ABOVE THE BENDING WOOD LIKE PRAIRIE GRASS FIRES DURING THE CALM SEASON OF INDIAN SUMMER THE FIRE CREEPS QUIETLY ALONG THE GROUND
MY EYES LIT UPON A BLACK FACE WATCHING ME I SAW THAT IT WAS THE SIMIAN CREATURE WHO HAD MET THE LAUNCH UPON THE BEACH HE WAS CLINGING TO THE OBLIQUE STEM OF A PALM TREE I GRIPPED MY STICK AND STOOD UP FACING HIM
THEY WERE ALWAYS EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR JERRY WOULD SAY IF YOU IN THE MORNING THROW MINUTES AWAY YOU CAN'T PICK THEM UP IN THE COURSE OF A DAY YOU MAY HURRY AND SCURRY AND FLURRY AND WORRY YOU'VE LOST THEM FOREVER FOREVER AND AYE
PREACHING TO US AND THEN DOING THE SAME HIMSELF LOOK HERE MATES SAID JERRY THE GENTLEMAN OFFERED ME HALF A CROWN EXTRA BUT I DIDN'T TAKE IT TWAS QUITE PAY ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEE HOW GLAD HE WAS TO CATCH THAT TRAIN
LEAVING THE TRUNKS AND BRANCHES SCARCELY SCARRED THE HEAT HOWEVER IS SUFFICIENT TO KILL THE TREE AND IN A FEW YEARS THE BARK SHRIVELS AND FALLS OFF FORESTS MILES IN EXTENT ARE THUS KILLED AND LEFT STANDING
THE BARK IS OF A BRIGHT CINNAMON COLOR AND IS HANDSOMELY BRAIDED AND RETICULATED ON THRIFTY TREES FLAKING OFF IN THIN SHINING RIBBONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES USED BY THE INDIANS FOR TENT MATTING
IN SHELTERED LAKE HOLLOWS ON BEDS OF ALLUVIUM THIS PINE VARIES SO FAR FROM THE COMMON FORM THAT FREQUENTLY IT COULD BE TAKEN FOR A DISTINCT SPECIES GROWING IN DAMP SODS LIKE GRASSES FROM FORTY TO EIGHTY FEET HIGH
AND WILL GLADLY PAY YOU AN EXTRA FARE I'LL DO MY VERY BEST SAID JERRY HEARTILY IF YOU THINK YOU ARE WELL ENOUGH SIR FOR HE LOOKED DREADFULLY WHITE AND ILL I MUST GO HE SAID EARNESTLY
ONE DAY TWO WILD LOOKING YOUNG MEN CAME OUT OF A TAVERN CLOSE BY THE STAND AND CALLED JERRY HERE CABBY LOOK SHARP WE ARE RATHER LATE PUT ON THE STEAM WILL YOU AND TAKE US TO THE VICTORIA IN TIME FOR THE ONE O'CLOCK TRAIN
HE HELD HIS OWN HAND OUT AND COUNTED HIS DIGITS SLOWLY ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE EIGH I DID NOT GRASP HIS MEANING THEN
THE YOUNG MAN PUT HIS HEAD OUT AND SAID ANXIOUSLY I THINK I HAD BETTER GET OUT AND WALK I SHALL NEVER GET THERE IF THIS GOES ON I'LL DO ALL THAT CAN BE DONE SIR SAID JERRY I THINK WE SHALL BE IN TIME
IN CALM SUN DAYS THE SUGAR PINE PREACHES LIKE AN ENTHUSIASTIC APOSTLE WITHOUT MOVING A LEAF ON LEVEL ROCKS THE JUNIPER DIES STANDING AND WASTES INSENSIBLY OUT OF EXISTENCE LIKE GRANITE THE WIND EXERTING ABOUT AS LITTLE CONTROL OVER IT
AND SAVE FOR A FEEBLE BAR OF DEAL SPIKED WITH A SMALL NAIL THE MEREST MOCKERY OF A MACE I WAS UNARMED
IT SEEMS TO BE A SURVIVOR OF SOME ANCIENT RACE WHOLLY UNACQUAINTED WITH ITS NEIGHBORS ITS BROAD STUMPINESS OF COURSE MAKES WIND WAVING OR EVEN SHAKING OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT IT IS NOT THIS ROCKY RIGIDITY THAT CONSTITUTES ITS SILENCE
IN TURN I RECALLED EACH ONE I HAD SEEN AND TRIED TO DRAW SOME AUGURY OF ASSISTANCE FROM MY MEMORY THEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A STAGHOUND BAY AND AT THAT REALISED A NEW DANGER I TOOK LITTLE TIME TO THINK
AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND FEET EXTENDING ITS TOUGH RATHER SLENDER ARMS IN THE FROSTY AIR WELCOMING THE STORMS AND FEEDING ON THEM AND REACHING SOMETIMES TO THE GRAND OLD AGE
THE MOUNTAIN PINE PINUS MONTICOLA IS THE NOBLEST TREE OF THE ALPINE ZONE HARDY AND LONG LIVED TOWERING GRANDLY ABOVE ITS COMPANIONS AND BECOMING STRONGER AND MORE IMPOSING
ARRIVING AT THE FOOT OF A TREE
WE'LL SHOW THEM HOW WE CAN GET OVER THE GROUND IF WE ONLY KNOW WHY IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO DRIVE FAST IN THE CITY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN THE STREETS ARE FULL OF TRAFFIC BUT WE DID WHAT COULD BE DONE AND WHEN A GOOD DRIVER
FOR WHO BETTER THAN HIMSELF COULD UNDERSTAND THE NEED OF A CHILD'S PRESENCE FOR THAT MATTER POLLYANNA TALKED TO EVERYBODY ABOUT JAMIE SHE ASSUMED THAT EVERYBODY WOULD BE AS INTERESTED AS SHE HERSELF WAS
HER MARRIAGE HAD BEEN HAPPY WEALTH HAD NOT SPOILED HER SHE WAS STILL THE PLACID AMIABLE PINK CHEEKED JANE OF THE OLD QUARTETTE SYMPATHISING WITH HER OLD CHUM'S HAPPINESS AND AS KEENLY INTERESTED IN ALL THE DAINTY DETAILS OF ANNE'S TROUSSEAU
THIS TIME BELDINGSVILLE DID NOT LITERALLY WELCOME POLLYANNA HOME WITH BRASS BANDS AND BUNTING PERHAPS BECAUSE THE HOUR OF HER EXPECTED ARRIVAL WAS KNOWN TO BUT FEW OF THE TOWNSPEOPLE
I'D BELIEVE ANYTHIN O THE MISTRESS NOW EVEN THAT SHE'D TAKE TER PLAYIN IT HERSELF BUT HAIN'T THE LITTLE GAL TOLD HER EVER SHE'S TOLD EV'RY ONE ELSE I GUESS I'M HEARIN OF IT EV'RYWHERE NOW SINCE SHE WAS HURTED SAID TOM
WHO OWNS THE HOUSE WELL IT'S THE PROPERTY OF THE GLEN SAINT MARY PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH NOW AND I RENTED IT FROM THE TRUSTEES BUT IT BELONGED UNTIL LATELY TO A VERY OLD LADY MISS ELIZABETH RUSSELL
BUT I FOR REASONS WHICH I DO NOT CARE TO SPEAK OF NOW I DON'T WISH DOCTOR CHILTON CALLED IN ON ON THIS CASE AND BELIEVE ME HE CAN NOT KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT ABOUT YOUR TROUBLE AS THIS GREAT DOCTOR DOES
OH NO DEAR IT WASN'T DOCTOR CHILTON AT ALL THAT I MEANT IT IS A NEW DOCTOR A VERY FAMOUS DOCTOR FROM NEW YORK WHO WHO KNOWS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT ABOUT HURTS LIKE YOURS
ON MOST OCCASIONS SHE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED IN THE INTEREST SHOWN BUT ONE DAY SHE MET WITH A SURPRISE IT CAME THROUGH JIMMY PENDLETON SAY LOOK A HERE HE DEMANDED ONE AFTERNOON IRRITABLY
AS WAS USUALLY THE CASE WHEN THIS QUESTION WAS PUT TO HER SHE BEGAN HER REPLY WITH A TROUBLED FROWN OH I LIKED IT I JUST LOVED IT SOME OF IT BUT NOT ALL OF IT SMILED MISTER PENDLETON
YES TWAS ALL ROUND ALL ROUND SIGHED NANCY IN HER TURN AS SHE WENT BACK TO HER KITCHEN FOR NO ONE WERE THOSE DAYS OF WAITING EASY THE NURSE TRIED TO LOOK CHEERFUL
SO GILBERT DIDN'T GO BACK ON YOU AFTER ALL SAID MISSUS HARMON ANDREWS CONTRIVING TO CONVEY AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE IN HER TONE
SO THAT THE RICH PEOPLE COULD GIVE THE POOR PEOPLE PART OF THEIR MONEY BUT AGAIN MISTER PENDLETON INTERRUPTED WITH A LAUGH OH POLLYANNA POLLYANNA HE CHUCKLED I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GETTING INTO PRETTY DEEP WATER
AND I KNOW SOMEBODY ELSE THAT SAID SO TOO WHO WAS IT THERE WAS NO ANSWER WHO WAS IT DEMANDED POLLYANNA MORE PEREMPTORILY DAD
WELL FASHION OR NO FASHION I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING PRETTIER FOR A SPARE ROOM BED THAN A NICE APPLE LEAF SPREAD THAT'S WHAT I MUST SEE ABOUT GETTING THEM BLEACHED I'VE HAD THEM SEWED UP IN COTTON BAGS EVER SINCE THOMAS DIED
AN MISS POLLYANNA LOOKIN ON AN BOSSIN FROM THE BED
THAT THESE PEOPLE DON'T CARE TO KNOW EACH OTHER HE ASKED QUIZZICALLY OH BUT SOME OF THEM DO MAINTAINED POLLYANNA IN EAGER DEFENSE
NANCY SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS OH SHE AIN'T HANDSOME OF COURSE BUT I WILL OWN UP SHE DON'T LOOK LIKE THE SAME WOMAN WHAT WITH THE RIBBONS AN LACE JIGGERS MISS POLLYANNA MAKES HER WEAR ROUND HER NECK
OLD TOM STIFFENED I WAS ONLY THINKIN TWOULD BE SOME OF A SURPRISE TO HER HE EXPLAINED WITH DIGNITY
IT SEEMS REAL STRANGE
SHE DIDN'T KNOW EM HERSELF SHE SAID FOLKS DIDN'T DOWN THERE THERE WAS A SLIGHT PAUSE THEN WITH A SIGH POLLYANNA RESUMED
HE WAS RICH TO BE SURE AND GILBERT IS POOR AT LEAST TO BEGIN WITH BUT THEN HE'S AN ISLAND BOY HE'S GILBERT BLYTHE SAID MARILLA CONTENTEDLY MARILLA WOULD HAVE DIED THE DEATH BEFORE SHE WOULD HAVE
THAT SHE WOULD DO ANYTHING ANYTHING BUT THAT TO PLEASE HER DEAR POLLYANNA AS THE DAYS OF WAITING PASSED ONE BY ONE IT DID INDEED SEEM THAT AUNT POLLY WAS DOING EVERYTHING BUT THAT
RED HAIR IS VERY FASHIONABLE NOW SAID ANNE TRYING TO SMILE BUT SPEAKING RATHER COLDLY LIFE HAD DEVELOPED IN HER A SENSE OF HUMOR WHICH HELPED HER OVER MANY DIFFICULTIES
IF TAIN'T MORE THAN TER LET IN THE CAT AN HER WHAT WOULDN'T LET FLUFF NOR BUFF UP STAIRS FOR LOVE NOR MONEY A WEEK AGO
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED FOLKS COMMENTED THE MAN I DO POLLYANNA FROWNED AGAIN AND PONDERED BUT WHAT'S THE USE OF SUCH A LOT OF THEM IF YOU DON'T KNOW EM AND MISSUS CAREW WOULDN'T LET ME
LIKE EATING DINNER AT NIGHT INSTEAD OF NOONS WHEN YOU OUGHT TO EAT IT BUT EVERYBODY WAS SO GOOD TO ME AND I SAW SUCH A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS BUNKER HILL AND THE PUBLIC GARDEN AND THE SEEING BOSTON AUTOS
CAUSE HE TOOK MISS JENNIE AWAY FROM EM AN MISS POLLY YOUNG AS SHE WAS COULDN'T NEVER FORGIVE HIM SHE WAS THAT FOND OF MISS JENNIE IN THEM DAYS I SEE I SEE TWAS A BAD MESS HE SIGHED AS HE TURNED AWAY
GROWING MORE AND MORE JEALOUS MOMENT BY MOMENT STILL DOGGEDLY HE HELD HIS GROUND WELL ANYHOW HE SCOFFED I DON'T THINK MUCH OF HIS NAME JAMIE HUMPH SOUNDS SISSY
BUT THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO LACK OF JOYFUL GREETINGS ON THE PART OF EVERYBODY FROM THE MOMENT SHE STEPPED FROM THE RAILWAY TRAIN WITH HER AUNT POLLY AND DOCTOR CHILTON NOR DID POLLYANNA LOSE ANY TIME
IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS PRAYED FOR SAID MISSUS RACHEL IN THE TONE OF ONE WHO IS COMFORTABLY SURE THAT HER PRAYERS HAVE AVAILED MUCH IT WAS A GREAT RELIEF TO FIND OUT THAT SHE REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE THE KINGSPORT MAN
THE NAME JAMIE THAT WAS DUBBED SISSY THE BOY SIGHED WE JUST WENT ON TILL WE FOUND ANOTHER PLACE AND TWAS THERE DAD DIED
THAT SHE COULD DO TO PLEASE HER NIECE I WOULDN'T A BELIEVED IT YOU COULDN'T A MADE ME BELIEVE IT NANCY SAID TO OLD TOM ONE MORNING
I NEVER SUPPOSED SHE'D WANT THEM THEY'RE SO OLD FASHIONED AND NOBODY SEEMS TO WANT ANYTHING BUT HOOKED MATS NOW BUT SHE ASKED ME FOR THEM SAID SHE'D RATHER HAVE THEM THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR HER FLOORS THEY ARE PRETTY
THE GODS SO SAYS THE OLD SUPERSTITION DO NOT LIKE TO BEHOLD TOO HAPPY MORTALS IT IS CERTAIN AT LEAST THAT SOME HUMAN BEINGS DO NOT
ONLY EMPHASIZED THE PITIFUL MOTIONLESSNESS OF THE ONCE ACTIVE LITTLE FEET AND LEGS NOW LYING SO WOEFULLY QUIET UNDER THE BLANKETS AS TO THE GAME POLLYANNA TOLD NANCY THESE DAYS HOW GLAD SHE WAS GOING TO BE
THERE IS A BIG GROVE OF FIR TREES BEHIND IT TWO ROWS OF LOMBARDY POPLARS DOWN THE LANE AND A RING OF WHITE BIRCHES AROUND A VERY DELIGHTFUL GARDEN OUR FRONT DOOR OPENS RIGHT INTO THE GARDEN
I'D LIKE TO BE ONE I DON'T DOUBT IT POLLYANNA SMILED THE MAN BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SCHEME OF YOURS FOR THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM ON YOUR HANDS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH
AND I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT AS WELL BE CUT DOWN AND THIS LAST SPRING THEY WERE WHITE AND SUCH A CROP OF PLUMS I NEVER REMEMBER AT GREEN GABLES
I HOPE YOU'LL BE VERY HAPPY YOU HAVE MY BEST WISHES I'M SURE A LONG ENGAGEMENT DOESN'T OFTEN TURN OUT WELL BUT OF COURSE IN YOUR CASE IT COULDN'T BE HELPED
THE NURSE ENTERED THE ROOM AT THAT MOMENT AND AUNT POLLY ROSE TO HER FEET ABRUPTLY A LOOK OF RELIEF ON HER FACE I AM VERY SORRY POLLYANNA SHE SAID A LITTLE STIFFLY
SHE SELLS BOWS LOVELY BOWS IN A BIG STORE SHE WANTS TO KNOW PEOPLE AND I INTRODUCED HER TO MISSUS CAREW AND WE HAD HER UP TO THE HOUSE AND WE HAD JAMIE AND LOTS OF OTHERS THERE TOO AND SHE WAS SO GLAD TO KNOW THEM
AN I DECLARE TER GOODNESS IF MISS POLLY HAIN'T
SHE LOOKS LIKE FOLKS NOW SHE'S ACTUALLY ALMOST KEERFUL NOW NANCY INTERRUPTED THE OLD MAN WITH A SLOW GRIN
CAME WITH HER MOTHER AND MISSUS JASPER BELL BUT IN JANE THE MILK OF HUMAN KINDNESS HAD NOT BEEN CURDLED BY YEARS OF MATRIMONIAL BICKERINGS HER LINES HAD FALLEN IN PLEASANT PLACES IN SPITE OF THE FACT AS MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WOULD SAY
IF IF YOU DON'T MIND VERY MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DOCTOR CHILTON TRULY I WOULD A DISTRESSED COLOR SUFFUSED MISS POLLY'S FACE FOR A MOMENT SHE DID NOT SPEAK AT ALL
WELL I GUESS YE WON'T THEN FROM ME OH MISTER TOM COME ON NOW WHEEDLED THE GIRL YE SEE THERE AIN'T MANY FOLKS HERE THAT I CAN ASK MAYBE NOT BUT THERE'S ONE ANYHOW THAT AIN'T ANSWERIN
GLEN SAINT MARY FOLKS PREFER PLUSH BROCADE AND SIDEBOARDS WITH MIRRORS AND ORNAMENTATIONS I FANCY BUT MISS RUSSELL'S FURNITURE IS VERY GOOD AND I FEEL SURE YOU'LL LIKE IT ANNE SO FAR GOOD SAID ANNE
I WONDER WHAT HIS FATE WAS WELL IT WAS A FORTUNATE MISTAKE SAID MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE THOUGH MIND YOU THERE WAS A TIME I DIDN'T THINK SO THAT EVENING I CAME UP TO SEE ANNE AND SHE TREATED US TO SUCH A SCENE
WE STOPPED MOST A WEEK WITH A FARMER DAD HELPED ABOUT THE HAYIN' AND I DID TOO SOME THE FARMER'S WIFE WAS AWFUL GOOD TO ME AND PRETTY QUICK SHE WAS CALLIN ME JAMIE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT SHE JUST DID
WASN'T THERE ANYBODY ELSE DOWN TO BOSTON BUT JUST THAT EVERLASTING JAMIE WHY JIMMY BEAN WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRIED POLLYANNA THE BOY LIFTED HIS CHIN A LITTLE
AND ONE DAY FATHER HEARD HER HE GOT AWFUL MAD SO MAD THAT I REMEMBERED IT ALWAYS WHAT HE SAID HE SAID JAMIE WASN'T NO SORT OF A NAME FOR A BOY
THERE WAS MORE EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR OF GREEN GABLES THAN THERE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE IN ALL ITS HISTORY EVEN MARILLA WAS SO EXCITED THAT SHE COULDN'T HELP SHOWING IT WHICH WAS LITTLE SHORT OF BEING PHENOMENAL
SHE WA'N'T THERE AND ALWAYS EVERYWHERE SHE WENT POLLYANNA MET THE QUESTION WELL HOW DID YOU LIKE BOSTON PERHAPS TO NO ONE DID SHE ANSWER THIS MORE FULLY THAN SHE DID TO MISTER PENDLETON
AND THAT'S WHAT MADE ME THINK THAT IF ONLY A LOT OF MISSUS CAREW'S KIND COULD KNOW THE OTHER KIND BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T DO THE INTRODUCING I DIDN'T KNOW MANY OF THEM MYSELF ANYWAY BUT IF THEY COULD KNOW EACH OTHER
FORE MISS POLLYANNA COME SAY MISTER TOM WHO WAS HER A LOVER I HAIN'T FOUND THAT OUT YET I HAIN'T I HAIN'T HAIN'T YE ASKED THE OLD MAN WITH AN ODD LOOK ON HIS FACE
PUT INTO WORDS THE THOUGHT THAT WAS ALWAYS IN THE BACKGROUND OF HER MIND WHENEVER SHE HAD LOOKED AT GILBERT FROM HIS CHILDHOOD UP THE THOUGHT THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HER OWN WILFUL PRIDE LONG LONG AGO HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HER SON
AND HAVE MORE THINGS TO EAT AND WEAR THAN THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH NOW IF THOSE FOLKS ONLY KNEW THE OTHER FOLKS BUT MISTER PENDLETON INTERRUPTED WITH A LAUGH MY DEAR CHILD DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
BUT THE HOUSE ITSELF GILBERT OUR FIRST HOME WHAT IS IT LIKE NOT VERY LARGE BUT LARGE ENOUGH FOR US THERE'S A SPLENDID LIVING ROOM WITH A FIREPLACE IN IT DOWNSTAIRS AND A DINING ROOM THAT LOOKS OUT ON THE HARBOR
IN TALKING OF JAMIE POLLYANNA LOST HER WORRIED BAFFLED LOOK POLLYANNA LOVED TO TALK OF JAMIE HERE WAS SOMETHING SHE UNDERSTOOD HERE WAS NO PROBLEM
BUT I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO LET ME BE THE JUDGE THIS TIME BESIDES IT'S ALREADY ARRANGED THE NEW YORK DOCTOR IS COMING TO MORROW AS IT HAPPENED HOWEVER THE NEW YORK DOCTOR DID NOT COME TO MORROW
I'M NOT JIMMY BEAN I'M JIMMY PENDLETON AND I MEAN THAT I SHOULD THINK FROM YOUR TALK THAT THERE WASN'T ANYBODY DOWN TO BOSTON BUT JUST THAT LOONY BOY WHO CALLS THEM BIRDS AND SQUIRRELS LADY LANCELOT
HUMAN NATURE IS NOT OBLIGED TO BE CONSISTENT
IN STARTING ON A ROUND OF FLY AWAY MINUTE CALLS ON ALL HER OLD FRIENDS INDEED FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS ACCORDING TO NANCY THERE WASN'T NO PUTTING OF YOUR FINGER ON HER ANYWHERES
AND YOU'VE KNOWN ME EVER SINCE REPEATED JIMMY BUT IN A FAR DIFFERENT VOICE JIMMY HAD SUDDENLY COME BACK TO THE PRESENT AND TO HIS GRIEVANCE BUT THEN I AIN'T JAMIE YOU KNOW HE FINISHED WITH SCORNFUL EMPHASIS
HER CHEEKS WERE VERY RED TOO I SAY IF YOU LOVED DOCTOR CHILTON AND DIDN'T LOVE THE OTHER ONE SIGHED POLLYANNA SEEMS TO ME THAT WOULD MAKE SOME DIFFERENCE IN THE GOOD HE WOULD DO AND I LOVE DOCTOR CHILTON
SHE'S SENT TIMOTHY DOWN TER COBB'S GREENHOUSE THREE TIMES FOR FRESH FLOWERS AN THAT BESIDES ALL THE POSIES FETCHED IN TER HER TOO AN THE OTHER DAY IF I DIDN'T FIND HER SITTIN
GILBERT LOOKS VERY YOUNG FOR A DOCTOR I'M AFRAID PEOPLE WON'T HAVE MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM SAID MISSUS JASPER BELL GLOOMILY THEN SHE SHUT HER MOUTH TIGHTLY AS IF SHE HAD SAID WHAT SHE CONSIDERED IT HER DUTY TO SAY AND HELD HER CONSCIENCE CLEAR
SHE BELONGED TO THE TYPE WHICH ALWAYS HAS A STRINGY BLACK FEATHER IN ITS HAT AND STRAGGLING LOCKS OF HAIR ON ITS NECK ANNE'S SURFACE PLEASURE IN HER PRETTY BRIDAL THINGS WAS TEMPORARILY SHADOWED
AND NO DOUBT THEY'RE AN AWFUL COLOR BUT THERE'S A MONTH YET AND DEW BLEACHING WILL WORK WONDERS ONLY A MONTH MARILLA SIGHED AND THEN SAID PROUDLY I'M GIVING ANNE THAT HALF DOZEN BRAIDED RUGS I HAVE IN THE GARRET
NO THERE'S PARTS OF IT OH I WAS GLAD TO BE THERE SHE EXPLAINED HASTILY I HAD A PERFECTLY LOVELY TIME AND LOTS OF THINGS WERE SO QUEER AND DIFFERENT YOU KNOW
AND RETURNED INNUMERABLE CHEERY ANSWERS TO THE MANY MESSAGES OF LOVE AND INQUIRY THAT WERE BROUGHT TO HER BEDSIDE BUT SHE TOO GREW PALE AND THIN AND THE NERVOUS ACTIVITY OF THE POOR LITTLE HANDS AND ARMS
THAT WOULD BE EXPECTING TOO MUCH BUT THERE IS A BROOK AND IT ACTUALLY CUTS ACROSS ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN THEN SAID ANNE WITH A LONG SIGH OF SUPREME SATISFACTION
BUT WHEN WE GET A PHONE IN THAT WON'T MATTER SO MUCH THE SITUATION IS BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKS TO THE SUNSET AND HAS THE GREAT BLUE HARBOR BEFORE IT THE SAND DUNES AREN'T VERY FAR AWAY THE SEA WINDS BLOW OVER THEM AND THE SEA SPRAY DRENCHES THEM
TWO OF THAT ILK DESCENDED UPON ANNE ONE VIOLET DUSK AND PROCEEDED TO DO WHAT IN THEM LAY TO PRICK THE RAINBOW BUBBLE OF HER SATISFACTION IF SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GETTING ANY PARTICULAR PRIZE IN YOUNG DOCTOR BLYTHE
AND HIS WIFE HAD A BABY HERE BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN A WEDDING BEFORE IT DOES SEEM SO STRANGE TO THINK OF ANNE BEING MARRIED IN A WAY SHE JUST SEEMS TO ME THE LITTLE GIRL MATTHEW BROUGHT HOME HERE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO
JANE WAS NOT BRILLIANT AND HAD PROBABLY NEVER MADE A REMARK WORTH LISTENING TO IN HER LIFE BUT SHE NEVER SAID ANYTHING THAT WOULD HURT ANYONE'S FEELINGS WHICH MAY BE A NEGATIVE TALENT BUT IS LIKEWISE A RARE AND ENVIABLE ONE
WITH HIS EYES TURNED AWAY YET THERE WAS A CURIOUS SOFTNESS IN HIS VOICE THAT WAS ALWAYS NOTICEABLE WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF HIS FATHER YOU YES TWAS JUST A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE HE DIED
I'M SO GLAD YOU DO WANT HIM AUNT POLLY'S FACE HAD TURNED WHITE THEN RED THEN BACK TO WHITE AGAIN BUT WHEN SHE ANSWERED SHE SHOWED VERY PLAINLY THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO SPEAK LIGHTLY AND CHEERFULLY
MARILLA FELT THAT IN SOME STRANGE WAY HIS MARRIAGE WITH ANNE WOULD PUT RIGHT THAT OLD MISTAKE GOOD HAD COME OUT OF THE EVIL OF THE ANCIENT BITTERNESS AS FOR ANNE HERSELF SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE ALMOST FELT FRIGHTENED
I COULDN'T GUESS I WOULDN'T THINK SHE COULD FIND ANYTHIN ABOUT THAT TER BE GLAD ABOUT SHE DID SHE SAID I COULD BE GLAD ANYHOW THAT I DIDN'T HAVE TER STOOP SO FAR TER DO MY WEEDIN
OLD TOM CHUCKLED WELL IT STRIKES ME MISS POLLY HERSELF AIN'T LOOKIN NONE THE WORSE FOR WEARIN THEM ERE CURLS ROUND HER FOREHEAD HE OBSERVED DRYLY COURSE SHE AIN'T RETORTED NANCY INDIGNANTLY
BUT THE DEEPS OF HAPPINESS BELOW COULD NOT THUS BE DISTURBED AND THE LITTLE STINGS OF MESDAMES BELL AND ANDREWS WERE FORGOTTEN WHEN GILBERT CAME LATER AND THEY WANDERED DOWN TO THE BIRCHES OF THE BROOK WHICH HAD BEEN SAPLINGS WHEN ANNE HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES
I MADE THEM OF THE NICEST RAGS AND BRAIDED THEM IN STRIPES IT WAS SUCH COMPANY THESE LAST FEW WINTERS
CAUSE THERE WA'N'T NO ONE ELSE SHE COULD PLAY IT WITH THOUGH SHE DID SPEAK OF HER AUNT MISS POLLY NANCY CHUCKLED I GUESS YOU HAIN'T GOT SUCH AN AWFUL DIFF'RENT OPINION O THE MISTRESS THAN I HAVE SHE BRIDLED
BRIDLED THE LITTLE GIRL AGGRIEVEDLY AS THE MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH AND ANYWAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOME FOLKS SHOULD HAVE SUCH A LOT AND OTHER FOLKS SHOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING AND I DON'T LIKE IT
POLLYANNA'S FACE FELL I DON'T BELIEVE HE KNOWS HALF SO MUCH AS DOCTOR CHILTON OH YES HE DOES I'M SURE DEAR BUT IT WAS DOCTOR CHILTON WHO DOCTORED MISTER PENDLETON'S BROKEN LEG AUNT POLLY
SURRENDERED AND LAUGHED WITH HIM WELL ANYWAY SHE REITERATED WHEN SHE HAD CAUGHT HER BREATH I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT ALL THE SAME NO DEAR I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T AGREED THE MAN
BUT AS YET NOTHING HAD AVAILED TO STEEL HER AGAINST A REFERENCE TO HER HAIR SO IT IS SO IT IS CONCEDED MISSUS HARMON THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT QUEER FREAKS FASHION WILL TAKE
AT THE LAST MOMENT A TELEGRAM TOLD OF AN UNAVOIDABLE DELAY OWING TO THE SUDDEN ILLNESS OF THE SPECIALIST HIMSELF
AND MILES OF PICTURES AND STATUES AND STORE WINDOWS AND STREETS THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANY END AND FOLKS I NEVER SAW SUCH A LOT OF FOLKS WELL I'M SURE
IT WAS WELL BUILT TO BEGIN WITH I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS SOME ROMANTIC STORY CONNECTED WITH ITS BUILDING BUT THE MAN I RENTED IT FROM DIDN'T KNOW IT HE SAID CAPTAIN JIM WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD SPIN THAT OLD YARN NOW WHO IS CAPTAIN JIM
I CAN'T REALIZE THAT SHE'S GROWN UP I SHALL NEVER FORGET WHAT I FELT WHEN I SAW MATTHEW BRINGING IN A GIRL
IF YOU KNEW HALF AS MUCH AS HE DOES YOU'D KNOW THAT TOO SHE FINISHED WITH FLASHING EYES JIMMY PENDLETON FLUSHED MISERABLY AND LOOKED UTTERLY WRETCHED
WHO WILL COME FROM NEW YORK TO MORROW POLLYANNA STILL LOOKED UNCONVINCED BUT AUNT POLLY IF YOU LOVED DOCTOR CHILTON WHAT POLLYANNA AUNT POLLY'S VOICE WAS VERY SHARP NOW
CAUSE I WAS ALREADY BENT PART WAY OVER NANCY GAVE A WISTFUL LAUGH WELL I AIN'T SURPRISED AFTER ALL YOU MIGHT KNOW SHE'D FIND SOMETHIN WE'VE BEEN PLAYIN IT THAT GAME SINCE ALMOST THE FIRST
GRINNED OLD TOM THEN ABRUPTLY THE LIGHT DIED FROM HIS EYES HOW IS SHE TER DAY THE LITTLE GAL NANCY SHOOK HER HEAD HER FACE TOO HAD SOBERED JUST THE SAME MISTER TOM
THERE AIN'T NO SPECIAL DIFF'RENCE AS I CAN SEE OR ANYBODY I GUESS SHE JEST LAYS THERE AN SLEEPS AN TALKS SOME AN TRIES TER SMILE AN BE GLAD CAUSE THE SUN SETS OR THE MOON RISES OR SOME OTHER SUCH THING
DOCTOR CHILTON OH AUNT POLLY I'D SO LOVE TO HAVE DOCTOR CHILTON I'VE WANTED HIM ALL THE TIME BUT I WAS AFRAID YOU DIDN'T ON ACCOUNT OF HIS SEEING YOU IN THE SUN PARLOR THAT DAY YOU KNOW SO I DIDN'T LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING BUT
I RECKON MAYBE THAT'S THE PART I DON'T LIKE THE MOST THAT FOLKS DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER IT WOULD BE SUCH A LOT NICER IF THEY DID WHY JUST THINK MISTER PENDLETON THERE ARE LOTS OF FOLKS THAT LIVE ON DIRTY NARROW STREETS
HE IS A VERY NICE BOY AND HE KNOWS A LOT BOOKS AND STORIES WHY HE CAN MAKE STORIES RIGHT OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD BESIDES IT ISN'T LADY LANCELOT IT'S SIR LANCELOT
OH YES SHE TOLD ME LONG AGO THE OLD MAN HESITATED THEN WENT ON HIS LIPS TWITCHING A LITTLE I WAS GROWLIN ONE DAY CAUSE I WAS SO BENT UP AND CROOKED AN WHAT DO YE S'POSE THE LITTLE THING SAID
I'M GOING TO GIVE ANNE TWO OF MY COTTON WARP SPREADS SHE RESUMED A TOBACCO STRIPE ONE AND AN APPLE LEAF ONE SHE TELLS ME THEY'RE GETTING TO BE REAL FASHIONABLE AGAIN
THAT HAD TO DEAL WITH BIG FEARSOME SOUNDING WORDS BESIDES IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE WOULD NOT MISTER PENDLETON BE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN MISSUS CAREW'S TAKING THE BOY INTO HER HOME
IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT JIMMY SAID MUCH OF THAT MYSTERIOUS PAST LIFE OF HIS BEFORE SHE HAD KNOWN HIM AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SHE PROMPTED POLLYANNA HAD FOR THE MOMENT FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE ORIGINAL SUBJECT OF THE CONTROVERSY
BUT WERE NOW TALL IVORY COLUMNS IN A FAIRY PALACE OF TWILIGHT AND STARS IN THEIR SHADOWS ANNE AND GILBERT TALKED IN LOVER FASHION OF THEIR NEW HOME AND THEIR NEW LIFE TOGETHER I'VE FOUND A NEST FOR US ANNE OH WHERE
THEN SHE SAID GENTLY THOUGH YET WITH A TOUCH OF HER OLD STERN DECISIVENESS BUT I DO MIND POLLYANNA I MIND VERY MUCH I WOULD DO ANYTHING ALMOST ANYTHING FOR YOU MY DEAR
THE HINGES ARE ON ONE TRUNK AND THE CATCH ON THE OTHER THEIR BOUGHS FORM AN ARCH OVERHEAD OH I'M SO GLAD I COULDN'T LIVE WHERE THERE WERE NO TREES SOMETHING VITAL IN ME WOULD STARVE
IT WAS SURELY THEIR DUTY TO PUT THE MATTER BEFORE HER IN ANOTHER LIGHT YET THESE TWO WORTHY LADIES WERE NOT ENEMIES OF ANNE ON THE CONTRARY THEY WERE REALLY QUITE FOND OF HER
BUT HER EYES WERE TROUBLED THE DOCTOR WAS OPENLY NERVOUS AND IMPATIENT MISS POLLY SAID LITTLE BUT EVEN THE SOFTENING WAVES OF HAIR ABOUT HER FACE AND THE BECOMING LACES AT HER THROAT COULD NOT HIDE THE FACT
WELL SHE DIDN'T TELL MISS POLLY REJOINED NANCY MISS POLLYANNA TOLD ME LONG AGO THAT SHE COULDN'T TELL HER CAUSE HER AUNT DIDN'T LIKE TER HAVE HER TALK ABOUT HER FATHER AN TWAS HER FATHER'S GAME
THAT SHE WAS GROWING THIN AND PALE AS TO POLLYANNA POLLYANNA PETTED THE DOG SMOOTHED THE CAT'S SLEEK HEAD ADMIRED THE FLOWERS AND ATE THE FRUITS AND JELLIES THAT WERE SENT IN TO HER
AS HE TURNED LOFTILY AWAY LEAVING A DISTRESSED BEWILDERED POLLYANNA BEHIND HIM WELL ANYWAY I CAN BE GLAD HE DOESN'T ALWAYS ACT LIKE THIS SIGHED THE LITTLE GIRL
FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER HE COULD COMMAND THE VISITS OF HIS OWN LITTLE CIRCLE IN A GREAT MEASURE AS HE LIKED HE HAD NOT MUCH INTERCOURSE WITH ANY FAMILIES BEYOND THAT CIRCLE HIS HORROR OF LATE HOURS AND LARGE DINNER PARTIES
TURNING FROM THE SOCIETY OF SO DESERVING A SISTER TO BESTOW HER AFFECTION AND CONFIDENCE ON ONE WHO OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO HER BUT THE OBJECT OF DISTANT CIVILITY FROM SITUATION MISSUS CLAY WAS IN LADY RUSSELL'S
SHE HAD NEVER BOASTED EITHER BEAUTY OR CLEVERNESS HER YOUTH HAD PASSED WITHOUT DISTINCTION AND HER MIDDLE OF LIFE WAS DEVOTED TO THE CARE OF A FAILING MOTHER AND THE ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE A SMALL INCOME GO AS FAR AS POSSIBLE
THAT A TRAIN OF TWENTY YOUNG COUPLE NOW WALKED AFTER HER TO CHURCH SHE WAS A PLAIN MOTHERLY KIND OF WOMAN WHO HAD WORKED HARD IN HER YOUTH AND NOW THOUGHT HERSELF ENTITLED TO THE OCCASIONAL HOLIDAY OF A TEA VISIT
FACE AND FIGURE I
SHE HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY VERY EARNEST IN TRYING TO GET ANNE INCLUDED IN THE VISIT TO LONDON SENSIBLY OPEN TO ALL THE INJUSTICE
THAT THE EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE AND THE SUPPER TABLE WHICH ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE
IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HIM THAT SIR WALTER COULD MATERIALLY ALTER HIS STYLE OF LIVING IN A HOUSE WHICH HAD SUCH A CHARACTER OF HOSPITALITY AND ANCIENT DIGNITY TO SUPPORT IN ANY OTHER PLACE SIR WALTER MIGHT JUDGE FOR HIMSELF AND WOULD BE LOOKED UP TO AS REGULATING THE MODES OF LIFE
AND BATH WAS TO BE HER HOME SIR WALTER HAD AT FIRST THOUGHT MORE OF LONDON BUT MISTER SHEPHERD FELT THAT HE COULD NOT BE TRUSTED IN LONDON AND HAD BEEN SKILFUL ENOUGH TO DISSUADE HIM FROM IT AND MAKE BATH PREFERRED
TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MISTER WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS YOUTH
KNOWING WESTON TO BE OUT AND THAT YOU MUST STILL FIGHT YOUR OWN BATTLE MISTER WESTON WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORT ME IF HE WERE HERE FOR HE THINKS EXACTLY AS I DO ON THE SUBJECT WE WERE SPEAKING OF IT ONLY YESTERDAY AND AGREEING HOW FORTUNATE IT WAS FOR EMMA
AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
AND YET SHE WAS A HAPPY WOMAN AND A WOMAN WHOM NO ONE NAMED WITHOUT GOOD WILL IT WAS HER OWN UNIVERSAL GOOD WILL AND CONTENTED TEMPER WHICH WORKED SUCH WONDERS SHE LOVED EVERY BODY
A LARGER SOCIETY WOULD IMPROVE THEM SHE WANTED HER TO BE MORE KNOWN THE UNDESIRABLENESS OF ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE SAME NEIGHBOURHOOD FOR SIR WALTER WAS CERTAINLY MUCH STRENGTHENED BY ONE PART AND A VERY MATERIAL PART OF THE SCHEME
I AM MUCH MISTAKEN IF EMMA'S DOCTRINES GIVE ANY STRENGTH OF MIND OR TEND AT ALL TO MAKE A GIRL ADAPT HERSELF RATIONALLY
MADE HIM UNFIT FOR ANY ACQUAINTANCE BUT SUCH AS WOULD VISIT HIM ON HIS OWN TERMS FORTUNATELY FOR HIM HIGHBURY INCLUDING RANDALLS IN THE SAME PARISH AND DONWELL ABBEY IN THE PARISH ADJOINING THE SEAT OF MISTER KNIGHTLEY
AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY NOT UNWILLING TO TALK
THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM AND THE SMILES OF HIS LOVELY DAUGHTER WAS IN NO DANGER OF BEING THROWN AWAY
AS RENTING A LARGE FARM OF MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND RESIDING IN THE PARISH OF DONWELL VERY CREDITABLY SHE BELIEVED SHE KNEW MISTER KNIGHTLEY THOUGHT HIGHLY OF THEM BUT THEY MUST BE COARSE AND UNPOLISHED
AND FELT AS A DUTY SHE RATED LADY RUSSELL'S INFLUENCE HIGHLY AND AS TO THE SEVERE DEGREE OF SELF DENIAL WHICH HER OWN CONSCIENCE PROMPTED SHE BELIEVED THERE MIGHT BE LITTLE MORE DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING THEM TO A COMPLETE THAN TO HALF A REFORMATION
SHE CONSIDERED IT AS AN ACT OF INDISPENSABLE DUTY TO CLEAR AWAY THE CLAIMS OF CREDITORS WITH ALL THE EXPEDITION WHICH THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE RETRENCHMENTS COULD SECURE AND SAW NO DIGNITY IN ANYTHING SHORT OF IT SHE WANTED IT TO BE PRESCRIBED
THIS WILL CERTAINLY BE THE BEGINNING OF ONE OF OUR QUARRELS ABOUT EMMA MISTER KNIGHTLEY
AND HAVING FORMERLY OWED MUCH TO MISTER WOODHOUSE'S KINDNESS FELT HIS PARTICULAR CLAIM ON HER TO LEAVE HER NEAT PARLOUR HUNG ROUND WITH FANCY WORK WHENEVER SHE COULD AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE
HOW CAN EMMA IMAGINE SHE HAS ANY THING TO LEARN HERSELF WHILE HARRIET IS PRESENTING SUCH A DELIGHTFUL INFERIORITY AND AS FOR HARRIET I WILL VENTURE TO SAY THAT SHE CANNOT GAIN BY THE ACQUAINTANCE
WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING
SHE ALWAYS DECLARES SHE WILL NEVER MARRY WHICH OF COURSE MEANS JUST NOTHING AT ALL BUT I HAVE NO IDEA THAT SHE HAS YET EVER SEEN A MAN SHE CARED FOR IT WOULD NOT BE A BAD THING FOR HER TO BE VERY MUCH IN LOVE WITH A PROPER OBJECT
OR ANY THING WHICH PROFESSED IN LONG SENTENCES OF REFINED NONSENSE TO COMBINE LIBERAL ACQUIREMENTS WITH ELEGANT MORALITY UPON NEW PRINCIPLES AND NEW SYSTEMS
MUST STILL SEE HEAR AND REMEMBER EMMA IS SPOILED BY BEING THE CLEVEREST OF HER FAMILY AT TEN YEARS OLD SHE HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHICH PUZZLED HER SISTER AT SEVENTEEN SHE WAS ALWAYS QUICK AND ASSURED
SEEM AS LITTLE TO TEMPT HER TO BREAK HER RESOLUTION AT PRESENT SAID MISSUS WESTON AS CAN WELL BE AND WHILE SHE IS SO HAPPY AT HARTFIELD I CANNOT WISH HER TO BE FORMING ANY ATTACHMENT WHICH WOULD BE CREATING SUCH DIFFICULTIES ON POOR MISTER WOODHOUSE'S ACCOUNT
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE EMMA IN LOVE AND IN SOME DOUBT OF A RETURN IT WOULD DO HER GOOD BUT THERE IS NOBODY HEREABOUTS TO ATTACH HER AND SHE GOES SO SELDOM FROM HOME THERE DOES INDEED
WHAT A BLOOM OF FULL HEALTH AND SUCH A PRETTY HEIGHT AND SIZE SUCH A FIRM AND UPRIGHT FIGURE THERE IS HEALTH NOT MERELY IN HER BLOOM BUT IN HER AIR HER HEAD HER GLANCE ONE HEARS SOMETIMES OF A CHILD BEING THE PICTURE OF HEALTH
IT HAS BEEN SO MANY YEARS MY PROVINCE TO GIVE ADVICE THAT YOU CANNOT BE SURPRIZED MISTER KNIGHTLEY AT THIS LITTLE REMAINS OF OFFICE NOT AT ALL CRIED HE I AM MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU FOR IT
THAT THEY SHOULD LOSE NEITHER CONSEQUENCE NOR ENJOYMENT BY SETTLING THERE LADY RUSSELL FELT OBLIGED TO OPPOSE HER DEAR ANNE'S KNOWN WISHES
SHE HAD A VALUE FOR RANK AND CONSEQUENCE WHICH BLINDED HER A LITTLE TO THE FAULTS OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED THEM HERSELF THE WIDOW OF ONLY A KNIGHT SHE GAVE THE DIGNITY OF A BARONET ALL ITS DUE AND SIR WALTER
ON HIS OWN TERMS AND AS A GREAT FAVOUR THAT HE WOULD LET IT AT ALL HOW QUICK COME THE REASONS FOR APPROVING WHAT WE LIKE LADY RUSSELL HAD ANOTHER EXCELLENT ONE AT HAND FOR BEING EXTREMELY GLAD THAT SIR WALTER AND HIS FAMILY WERE TO REMOVE FROM THE COUNTRY
PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
IT WAS A MUCH SAFER PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN IN HIS PREDICAMENT HE MIGHT THERE BE IMPORTANT AT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EXPENSE TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH OVER LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT
SHE WOULD IMPROVE HER SHE WOULD DETACH HER FROM HER BAD ACQUAINTANCE AND INTRODUCE HER INTO GOOD SOCIETY SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING
AFTER THESE CAME A SECOND SET AMONG THE MOST COME AT ABLE OF WHOM WERE MISSUS AND MISS BATES AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD
A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF INDIFFERENCE FOR EVERYTHING BUT JUSTICE AND EQUITY IF WE CAN PERSUADE YOUR FATHER TO ALL THIS SAID LADY RUSSELL LOOKING OVER HER PAPER MUCH MAY BE DONE IF HE WILL ADOPT THESE REGULATIONS IN SEVEN YEARS HE WILL BE CLEAR
AND ON THE PRESENT EVENING HAD PARTICULAR PLEASURE IN SENDING THEM AWAY HAPPY THE HAPPINESS OF MISS SMITH WAS QUITE EQUAL TO HER INTENTIONS MISS WOODHOUSE WAS SO GREAT A PERSONAGE IN HIGHBURY
THERE IS HARDLY ANY DESIRING TO REFRESH SUCH A MEMORY AS THAT SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY FEELINGLY AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE HAD DONE BUT I HE SOON ADDED WHO HAVE HAD NO SUCH CHARM THROWN OVER MY SENSES
HE WOULD SOONER QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AT ONCE THAN REMAIN IN IT ON SUCH DISGRACEFUL TERMS QUIT KELLYNCH HALL THE HINT WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN UP BY MISTER SHEPHERD WHOSE INTEREST WAS INVOLVED IN THE REALITY OF SIR WALTER'S RETRENCHING
WHICH HAD BEEN HAPPILY ENGRAFTED ON THE BEGINNING HE WAS NOT ONLY TO QUIT HIS HOME BUT TO SEE IT IN THE HANDS OF OTHERS A TRIAL OF FORTITUDE WHICH STRONGER HEADS THAN SIR WALTER'S HAVE FOUND TOO MUCH KELLYNCH HALL WAS TO BE LET
IN WHATEVER WAY HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO MODEL HIS HOUSEHOLD SIR WALTER WOULD QUIT KELLYNCH HALL AND AFTER A VERY FEW DAYS MORE OF DOUBT AND INDECISION THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS SETTLED AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT
BUT YOU WERE PREPARING YOURSELF TO BE AN EXCELLENT WIFE ALL THE TIME YOU WERE AT HARTFIELD YOU MIGHT NOT GIVE EMMA SUCH A COMPLETE EDUCATION AS YOUR POWERS WOULD SEEM TO PROMISE BUT YOU WERE RECEIVING A VERY GOOD EDUCATION FROM HER
FOR HIGHBURY WAS RECKONED A PARTICULARLY HEALTHY SPOT SHE HAD AN AMPLE HOUSE AND GARDEN GAVE THE CHILDREN PLENTY OF WHOLESOME FOOD LET THEM RUN ABOUT A GREAT DEAL IN THE SUMMER AND IN WINTER DRESSED THEIR CHILBLAINS WITH HER OWN HANDS IT WAS NO WONDER
THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH A GIRL IN HIGHBURY FOR HER TO ASSOCIATE WITH MISTER KNIGHTLEY I SHALL NOT ALLOW YOU TO BE A FAIR JUDGE IN THIS CASE YOU ARE SO MUCH USED TO LIVE ALONE
SHE WILL NEVER SUBMIT TO ANY THING REQUIRING INDUSTRY AND PATIENCE AND A SUBJECTION OF THE FANCY TO THE UNDERSTANDING WHERE MISS TAYLOR FAILED TO STIMULATE I MAY SAFELY AFFIRM THAT HARRIET SMITH WILL DO NOTHING
THIS HOWEVER WAS A PROFOUND SECRET NOT TO BE BREATHED BEYOND THEIR OWN CIRCLE SIR WALTER COULD NOT HAVE BORNE THE DEGRADATION OF BEING KNOWN TO DESIGN LETTING HIS HOUSE MISTER SHEPHERD HAD ONCE MENTIONED THE WORD ADVERTISE
I CONSIDER MYSELF YOU KNOW AS HAVING SOMEWHAT OF THE PRIVILEGE OF SPEECH THAT EMMA'S MOTHER MIGHT HAVE HAD THE LIBERTY OF HINTING THAT I DO NOT THINK ANY POSSIBLE GOOD CAN ARISE FROM HARRIET SMITH'S INTIMACY BEING MADE A MATTER OF MUCH DISCUSSION AMONG YOU PRAY EXCUSE ME
I AM SURE YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT ME UNFIT FOR THE OFFICE I HELD YES SAID HE SMILING YOU ARE BETTER PLACED HERE
IN MARKING OUT THE SCHEME OF RETRENCHMENT WHICH WAS AT LAST SUBMITTED TO SIR WALTER EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF HONESTY AGAINST IMPORTANCE SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES A MORE COMPLETE REFORMATION A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT
THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER THE FRIENDS FROM WHOM SHE HAD JUST PARTED THOUGH VERY GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE MUST BE DOING HER HARM THEY WERE A FAMILY OF THE NAME OF MARTIN
BUT I CONFESS THAT I HAVE SELDOM SEEN A FACE OR FIGURE MORE PLEASING TO ME THAN HERS BUT I AM A PARTIAL OLD FRIEND SUCH AN EYE THE TRUE HAZLE EYE AND SO BRILLIANT REGULAR FEATURES
ISABELLA SLOW AND DIFFIDENT AND EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE EMMA HAS BEEN MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AND OF YOU ALL IN HER MOTHER SHE LOST THE ONLY PERSON ABLE TO COPE WITH HER SHE INHERITS HER MOTHER'S TALENTS AND MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER SUBJECTION TO HER
THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT
SERLE UNDERSTANDS BOILING AN EGG BETTER THAN ANY BODY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU
MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF OR FRIGHTEN THOSE WHO MIGHT HATE HER INTO OUTWARD RESPECT
THE LIST SHE DREW UP WHEN ONLY FOURTEEN I REMEMBER THINKING IT DID HER JUDGMENT SO MUCH CREDIT THAT I PRESERVED IT SOME TIME AND I DARE SAY SHE MAY HAVE MADE OUT A VERY GOOD LIST NOW BUT I HAVE DONE WITH EXPECTING ANY COURSE OF STEADY READING FROM EMMA
OR MY DREAD OF ITS DOING THEM BOTH HARM AND I MISTER KNIGHTLEY AM EQUALLY STOUT IN MY CONFIDENCE OF ITS NOT DOING THEM ANY HARM WITH ALL DEAR EMMA'S LITTLE FAULTS SHE IS AN EXCELLENT CREATURE WHERE SHALL WE SEE A BETTER DAUGHTER
AND SEEMED TO LOVE HER RATHER BECAUSE SHE WOULD LOVE HER THAN BECAUSE ELIZABETH DESERVED IT SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE THAN OUTWARD ATTENTION NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY AGAINST PREVIOUS INCLINATION
NOW EMMA ALWAYS GIVES ME THE IDEA OF BEING THE COMPLETE PICTURE OF GROWN UP HEALTH SHE IS LOVELINESS ITSELF MISTER KNIGHTLEY IS NOT SHE I HAVE NOT A FAULT TO FIND WITH HER PERSON HE REPLIED I THINK HER ALL YOU DESCRIBE I LOVE TO LOOK AT HER
THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT AND HAPPY WAS SHE FOR HER FATHER'S SAKE IN THE POWER THOUGH AS FAR AS SHE WAS HERSELF CONCERNED IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON
AS TO HAVE BEEN ALREADY STAYING THERE MORE THAN ONCE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT LADY RUSSELL WHO THOUGHT IT A FRIENDSHIP QUITE OUT OF PLACE COULD HINT OF CAUTION AND RESERVE LADY RUSSELL INDEED HAD SCARCELY ANY INFLUENCE WITH ELIZABETH
BUT SUPPOSING ANY LITTLE INCONVENIENCE MAY BE APPREHENDED FROM THE INTIMACY IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT EMMA ACCOUNTABLE TO NOBODY BUT HER FATHER WHO PERFECTLY APPROVES THE ACQUAINTANCE SHOULD PUT AN END TO IT SO LONG AS IT IS A SOURCE OF PLEASURE TO HERSELF
OH YOU WOULD RATHER TALK OF HER PERSON THAN HER MIND WOULD YOU VERY WELL I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY EMMA'S BEING PRETTY PRETTY SAY BEAUTIFUL RATHER CAN YOU IMAGINE ANY THING NEARER PERFECT BEAUTY THAN EMMA ALTOGETHER
AND WHO WAS PERFECTLY PERSUADED THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE WITHOUT A CHANGE OF ABODE SINCE THE IDEA HAD BEEN STARTED IN THE VERY QUARTER WHICH OUGHT TO DICTATE HE HAD NO SCRUPLE HE SAID IN CONFESSING HIS JUDGEMENT TO BE ENTIRELY ON THAT SIDE
THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS
YOU NEVER COULD PERSUADE HER TO READ HALF SO MUCH AS YOU WISHED YOU KNOW YOU COULD NOT I DARE SAY REPLIED MISSUS WESTON SMILING THAT I THOUGHT SO THEN BUT SINCE WE HAVE PARTED I CAN NEVER REMEMBER EMMA'S OMITTING TO DO ANY THING I WISHED
SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT
BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL
AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO
EMMA MUST DO HARRIET GOOD AND BY SUPPLYING HER WITH A NEW OBJECT OF INTEREST HARRIET MAY BE SAID TO DO EMMA GOOD I HAVE BEEN SEEING THEIR INTIMACY WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE HOW VERY DIFFERENTLY WE FEEL NOT THINK THEY WILL DO EACH OTHER ANY GOOD
OR A KINDER SISTER OR A TRUER FRIEND NO NO SHE HAS QUALITIES WHICH MAY BE TRUSTED SHE WILL NEVER LEAD ANY ONE REALLY WRONG SHE WILL MAKE NO LASTING BLUNDER WHERE EMMA ERRS ONCE SHE IS IN THE RIGHT A HUNDRED TIMES
AND WAS CONSIDERED WITH ALL THE REGARD AND RESPECT WHICH A HARMLESS OLD LADY UNDER SUCH UNTOWARD CIRCUMSTANCES CAN EXCITE HER DAUGHTER ENJOYED A MOST UNCOMMON DEGREE OF POPULARITY
AND ON MANY LESSER OCCASIONS HAD ENDEAVOURED TO GIVE ELIZABETH THE ADVANTAGE OF HER OWN BETTER JUDGEMENT AND EXPERIENCE BUT ALWAYS IN VAIN ELIZABETH WOULD GO HER OWN WAY AND NEVER HAD SHE PURSUED IT IN MORE DECIDED OPPOSITION TO LADY RUSSELL THAN IN THIS SELECTION OF MISSUS CLAY
SHE MADE EXACT CALCULATIONS AND SHE DID WHAT NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF DOING SHE CONSULTED ANNE WHO NEVER SEEMED CONSIDERED BY THE OTHERS AS HAVING ANY INTEREST IN THE QUESTION SHE CONSULTED AND IN A DEGREE WAS INFLUENCED BY HER
LADY RUSSELL WAS MOST ANXIOUSLY ZEALOUS ON THE SUBJECT AND GAVE IT MUCH SERIOUS CONSIDERATION SHE WAS A WOMAN RATHER OF SOUND THAN OF QUICK ABILITIES WHOSE DIFFICULTIES IN COMING TO ANY DECISION IN THIS INSTANCE WERE GREAT
HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE HER LEISURE AND POWERS SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES IN TALKING AND LISTENING AND FORMING ALL THESE SCHEMES IN THE IN BETWEENS
THERE IS AN ANXIETY A CURIOSITY IN WHAT ONE FEELS FOR EMMA I WONDER WHAT WILL BECOME OF HER SO DO I SAID MISSUS WESTON GENTLY VERY MUCH
STRICT IN HER NOTIONS OF DECORUM AND WITH MANNERS THAT WERE HELD A STANDARD OF GOOD BREEDING SHE HAD A CULTIVATED MIND AND WAS GENERALLY SPEAKING RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT BUT SHE HAD PREJUDICES ON THE SIDE OF ANCESTRY
SHE WAS A CLEVER YOUNG WOMAN WHO UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF PLEASING
WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY A NOTE WAS BROUGHT FROM MISSUS GODDARD REQUESTING IN MOST RESPECTFUL TERMS
AND PERHAPS NO MAN CAN BE A GOOD JUDGE OF THE COMFORT A WOMAN FEELS IN THE SOCIETY OF ONE OF HER OWN SEX AFTER BEING USED TO IT ALL HER LIFE I CAN IMAGINE YOUR OBJECTION TO HARRIET SMITH SHE IS NOT THE SUPERIOR YOUNG WOMAN WHICH EMMA'S FRIEND OUGHT TO BE
WHAT EVERY COMFORT OF LIFE KNOCKED OFF JOURNEYS LONDON SERVANTS HORSES TABLE CONTRACTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS EVERY WHERE TO LIVE NO LONGER WITH THE DECENCIES EVEN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN NO
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY MISTER KNIGHTLEY TO BE DEPENDENT ON YOUR RECOMMENDATION HAD I QUITTED MISTER WOODHOUSE'S FAMILY AND WANTED ANOTHER SITUATION
BY PASSING ALL THE WARM MONTHS WITH HER AT KELLYNCH LODGE EVERY DANGER WOULD BE AVOIDED AND IT WAS IN FACT A CHANGE WHICH MUST DO BOTH HEALTH AND SPIRITS GOOD ANNE HAD BEEN TOO LITTLE FROM HOME TOO LITTLE SEEN HER SPIRITS WERE NOT HIGH
THAT SHE MUST HAVE GOOD SENSE AND DESERVE ENCOURAGEMENT ENCOURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS
ELIZABETH HAD BEEN LATELY FORMING AN INTIMACY WHICH SHE WISHED TO SEE INTERRUPTED IT WAS WITH THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER SHEPHERD WHO HAD RETURNED AFTER AN UNPROSPEROUS MARRIAGE TO HER FATHER'S HOUSE WITH THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF TWO CHILDREN
HIS CARE FOR THEIR HEALTH MADE HIM GRIEVE THAT THEY WOULD EAT SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT HE COULD WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND
I HOPE NOT THAT IT IS NOT LIKELY NO MISTER KNIGHTLEY DO NOT FORETELL VEXATION FROM THAT QUARTER NOT I INDEED I ONLY NAME POSSIBILITIES I DO NOT PRETEND TO EMMA'S GENIUS FOR FORETELLING AND GUESSING
WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE
HARTFIELD WILL ONLY PUT HER OUT OF CONCEIT WITH ALL THE OTHER PLACES SHE BELONGS TO SHE WILL GROW JUST REFINED ENOUGH TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THOSE AMONG WHOM BIRTH AND CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE PLACED HER HOME
MISSUS BATES THE WIDOW OF A FORMER VICAR OF HIGHBURY WAS A VERY OLD LADY ALMOST PAST EVERY THING BUT TEA AND QUADRILLE SHE LIVED WITH HER SINGLE DAUGHTER IN A VERY SMALL WAY
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND AS EMMA WANTS TO SEE HER BETTER INFORMED IT WILL BE AN INDUCEMENT TO HER TO READ MORE HERSELF THEY WILL READ TOGETHER SHE MEANS IT I KNOW EMMA HAS BEEN MEANING TO READ MORE EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD
WE MUST BE SERIOUS AND DECIDED
AND SOMEBODY HAD LATELY RAISED HER FROM THE CONDITION OF SCHOLAR TO THAT OF PARLOUR BOARDER THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS GENERALLY KNOWN OF HER HISTORY SHE HAD NO VISIBLE FRIENDS BUT WHAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED AT HIGHBURY
UNDER HIS PRESENT DIFFICULTIES THEY MUST RETRENCH THAT DID NOT ADMIT OF A DOUBT BUT SHE WAS VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE IT DONE WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE PAIN TO HIM AND ELIZABETH SHE DREW UP PLANS OF ECONOMY
AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL
DO YOU REALLY THINK IT A BAD THING WHY SO I THINK THEY WILL NEITHER OF THEM DO THE OTHER ANY GOOD
THAT KELLYNCH HALL HAS A RESPECTABILITY IN ITSELF WHICH CANNOT BE AFFECTED BY THESE REDUCTIONS AND THAT THE TRUE DIGNITY OF SIR WALTER ELLIOT WILL BE VERY FAR FROM LESSENED IN THE EYES OF SENSIBLE PEOPLE
WHY TO OWN THE TRUTH I AM AFRAID YOU ARE RATHER THROWN AWAY AND THAT WITH EVERY DISPOSITION TO BEAR THERE WILL BE NOTHING TO BE BORNE WE WILL NOT DESPAIR HOWEVER WESTON MAY GROW CROSS FROM THE WANTONNESS OF COMFORT OR HIS SON MAY PLAGUE HIM
LONDON BATH OR ANOTHER HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY ALL ANNE'S WISHES HAD BEEN FOR THE LATTER A SMALL HOUSE IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE THEY MIGHT STILL HAVE LADY RUSSELL'S SOCIETY STILL BE NEAR MARY
FROM THE OPPOSITION OF TWO LEADING PRINCIPLES SHE WAS OF STRICT INTEGRITY HERSELF WITH A DELICATE SENSE OF HONOUR BUT SHE WAS AS DESIROUS OF SAVING SIR WALTER'S FEELINGS AS SOLICITOUS FOR THE CREDIT OF THE FAMILY
THE SIMPLICITY AND CHEERFULNESS OF HER NATURE HER CONTENTED AND GRATEFUL SPIRIT WERE A RECOMMENDATION TO EVERY BODY AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS
I WILL NOT RAISE ANY OUTCRY I WILL KEEP MY ILL HUMOUR TO MYSELF I HAVE A VERY SINCERE INTEREST IN EMMA ISABELLA DOES NOT SEEM MORE MY SISTER HAS NEVER EXCITED A GREATER INTEREST PERHAPS HARDLY SO GREAT
OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL AND HELP AND RECOMMEND THE MINCED CHICKEN AND SCALLOPED OYSTERS WITH AN URGENCY WHICH SHE KNEW WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE
COMPREHENDED MANY SUCH NOT UNFREQUENTLY THROUGH EMMA'S PERSUASION HE HAD SOME OF THE CHOSEN AND THE BEST TO DINE WITH HIM BUT EVENING PARTIES WERE WHAT HE PREFERRED AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY

DON DIEGO STROKED HIS POINTED BLACK BEARD CAN YOU GIVE ME UNTIL MORNING FOR REFLECTION MY HEAD ACHES SO DAMNABLY THAT I AM INCAPABLE OF THOUGHT AND THIS YOU WILL ADMIT
THE EVOLUTION OR DEVELOPMENT THEORY DECLARES THE UNIVERSE AS IT NOW EXISTS TO BE THE RESULT OF A LONG SERIES OF CHANGES WHICH WERE SO FAR RELATED TO EACH OTHER AS TO FORM A SERIES OF GROWTHS ANALOGOUS TO THE EVOLVING OF THE PARTS OF A GROWING ORGANISM
THEOSOPHY MUCH IS SAID NOWADAYS ABOUT THEOSOPHY WHICH IS REALLY BUT ANOTHER NAME FOR MYSTICISM IT IS NOT A PHILOSOPHY FOR IT WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PHILOSOPHICAL METHODS IT MIGHT BE CALLED A RELIGION
YET IT PROVED SOOTHING TO DON DIEGO BEING SO MUCH LESS STARTLING THAN THE THINGS HE WAS BEGINNING TO IMAGINE BUT ARE YOU NOT SPANISH THEN YOU FLATTER MY CASTILIAN ACCENT I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE IRISH
DON DIEGO STRUGGLED UP INTO A SITTING POSITION ON THE RED VELVET COUCH

ABOUT SEVENTEEN FIFTY AND OTHER WRITERS FOLLOWED OUT THE IDEA THE ECCENTRIC LORD MONBODDO WAS THE FIRST TO SUGGEST THE POSSIBLE DESCENT OF MAN FROM THE APE ABOUT SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FOUR IN EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN

THE SPANIARD SIGHED AND SAT UPRIGHT TO FACE THE RETURNING CAPTAIN BLOOD WITH THE ANSWER FOR WHICH HE CAME I HAVE THOUGHT OF AN ALTERNATIVE SIR CAPTAIN BUT IT DEPENDS UPON YOUR CHARITY
IT IS THAT YOU PUT US ASHORE ON ONE OF THE ISLANDS OF THIS PESTILENT ARCHIPELAGO AND LEAVE US TO SHIFT FOR OURSELVES CAPTAIN BLOOD PURSED HIS LIPS

THE FIRST ENGLISH SPARROW WAS BROUGHT TO THE UNITED STATES IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY BUT IT WAS NOT UNTIL EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THAT THE SPECIES CAN BE SAID TO HAVE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED ITSELF
IF THE FRONT TEETH ARE WIDE APART IT MEANS ONE CAN'T KEEP A SECRET IF OVERLAPPING ONE IS CLOSE MOUTHED
SAID THE SPANIARD PENSIVELY HE SWUNG HIS LEGS FROM THE COUCH AND SAT NOW UPON THE EDGE OF IT HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES
BUT MY FRIEND I DID NOT AGREE SO MUCH
MOLE ABOVE BREATH MEANS WEALTH
BUT AS A THEORY EVOLUTION BELONGS TO THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEIBNITZ IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY FIRST UTTERED THE OPINION THAT THE EARTH WAS ONCE IN A FLUID CONDITION

RETURNING ABOARD HE HAD STEPPED ON TO HIS OWN DECK AGAIN THERE MEMORY ABRUPTLY AND INEXPLICABLY CEASED HE WAS BEGINNING TO TORTURE HIS MIND WITH CONJECTURE
IT WAS A NARRATIVE THAT PAINTED RED AND WHITE BY TURNS THE SPANIARD'S COUNTENANCE HE PUT A HAND TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND THERE DISCOVERED IN CONFIRMATION OF THE STORY A LUMP AS LARGE AS A PIGEON'S EGG
AND THE OBJECT OF THEOSOPHICAL STUDY IS PROFESSEDLY TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF DIVINE THINGS IT DIFFERS HOWEVER FROM BOTH PHILOSOPHY AND THEOLOGY EVEN WHEN THESE HAVE THE SAME OBJECT OF INVESTIGATION FOR

YOU DO NOT DESIRE TO LIVE AH THAT I CAN ANSWER I DO DESIRE TO LIVE AND EVEN MORE DO I DESIRE THAT MY SON MAY LIVE BUT THE DESIRE SHALL NOT MAKE A COWARD OF ME FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT MASTER MOCKER
THEN THE SPANIARD BROKE OFF HIS GLANCE GREW STILL MORE TROUBLED
THEN WILDLY HIS EYES LOOKED ABOUT HIM THEY SCANNED THE CABIN ONCE AGAIN SCRUTINIZING EACH FAMILIAR OBJECT AM I MAD HE ASKED AT LAST
ACCEPT THE TRUTHS OF RECORDED REVELATION AS IMMUTABLE BUT AS SUBJECT TO MODIFICATION BY LATER AND PERSONAL REVELATIONS THE THEOSOPHICAL IDEA HAS HAD FOLLOWERS FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES

DELIRIOUS IN FACT AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN ILL TREATMENT HE RECEIVED ASHORE BEFORE WE CARRIED HIM AWAY WITH US
LASTLY HE STARED WILD EYED AT THE SARDONIC CAPTAIN BLOOD AND MY SON
IT IS I WHO MAY RATHER EXPECT TO BE ILL FOR I AM NOW SUFFERING UNDER A VERY HEAVY DISAPPOINTMENT DISAPPOINTMENT YES FOR I AM UNABLE TO KEEP MY ENGAGEMENT WITH YOU
AND SO ENDED ALL THE HOPES HIS SELFISH VANITY HAD RAISED IN MARIA AND JULIA BERTRAM JULIA COULD REJOICE THAT HE WAS GONE HIS PRESENCE WAS BEGINNING TO BE ODIOUS TO HER AND IF MARIA GAINED HIM NOT
AND THEY MAY SOON BE ENTIRELY DONE AWAY IF WE FIND THEY CORRESPOND EVERY FEAR OF MINE WILL BE REMOVED A MIGHTY CONCESSION INDEED IF YOU WERE TO SEE THEM AT THE ALTAR
YOUR LADY AND I SHALL BE VERY SAFE YOU KNOW HOW STEADY STEPHEN IS AND CHARLES HAS BEEN UPON THE LEADERS SO OFTEN NOW THAT I AM SURE THERE IS NO FEAR BUT HOWEVER I SOON FOUND IT WOULD NOT DO HE WAS BENT UPON GOING
IT WAS NOT INCLINATION THAT HE WANTED ELINOR I COULD PLAINLY SEE THAT HE HAD NOT THE POWER OF ACCEPTING IT I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER I ASSURE YOU
ONE MOMENT SHE FEARED THAT NO SERIOUS DESIGN HAD EVER BEEN FORMED ON HIS SIDE AND THE NEXT THAT SOME UNFORTUNATE QUARREL HAD TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN HIM AND HER SISTER
HE LEFT THE HOUSE IN ALL THE SOBERNESS OF ITS GENERAL CHARACTER AND SIR THOMAS HOPED IN SEEING HIM OUT OF IT TO BE RID OF THE WORST OBJECT CONNECTED WITH THE SCHEME AND THE LAST THAT MUST BE INEVITABLY REMINDING HIM OF ITS EXISTENCE
DO YOU SUPPOSE HIM REALLY INDIFFERENT TO HER NO I CANNOT THINK THAT HE MUST AND DOES LOVE HER I AM SURE BUT WITH A STRANGE KIND OF TENDERNESS IF HE CAN LEAVE HER WITH SUCH INDIFFERENCE
WHERE THEY FOUND ONLY WILLOUGHBY WHO WAS LEANING AGAINST THE MANTEL PIECE WITH HIS BACK TOWARDS THEM HE TURNED ROUND ON THEIR COMING IN AND HIS COUNTENANCE SHEWED THAT HE STRONGLY PARTOOK OF THE EMOTION WHICH OVER POWERED MARIANNE
I CAN HARDLY TELL MYSELF BUT SUSPICION OF SOMETHING UNPLEASANT IS THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH AN ALTERATION AS WE JUST WITNESSED IN HIM
YOU MUST THINK WRETCHEDLY INDEED OF WILLOUGHBY IF AFTER ALL THAT HAS OPENLY PASSED BETWEEN THEM YOU CAN DOUBT THE NATURE OF THE TERMS ON WHICH THEY ARE TOGETHER HAS HE BEEN ACTING A PART IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO YOUR SISTER ALL THIS TIME
WAS IN HAVING FORMED THE CONNEXION WITH THE RUSHWORTHS THERE SHE WAS IMPREGNABLE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE CREDIT OF BRINGING MISTER RUSHWORTH'S ADMIRATION OF MARIA TO ANY EFFECT IF I HAD NOT BEEN ACTIVE SAID SHE
DO NOT BLAME HIM HOWEVER FOR DEPARTING FROM HIS CHARACTER WHERE THE DEVIATION IS NECESSARY BUT YOU REALLY DO ADMIT THE JUSTICE OF WHAT I HAVE SAID IN HIS DEFENCE I AM HAPPY AND HE IS ACQUITTED NOT ENTIRELY
SHOULD LEAVE HER AND LEAVE HER PERHAPS FOR MONTHS WITHOUT TELLING HER OF HIS AFFECTION THAT THEY SHOULD PART WITHOUT A MUTUAL EXCHANGE OF CONFIDENCE I CONFESS REPLIED ELINOR
AS A DIFFERENCE IN JUDGMENT FROM MYSELF OR A DEVIATION FROM WHAT I MAY THINK RIGHT AND CONSISTENT YOU SPEAK VERY PROPERLY WILLOUGHBY CERTAINLY DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE SUSPECTED
IT IS ABOUT MY UNCLE'S USUAL TIME WHEN DO YOU THINK OF GOING I MAY PERHAPS GET AS FAR AS BANBURY TO DAY WHOSE STABLES DO YOU USE AT BATH WAS THE NEXT QUESTION
THAT WHERE THE PRESENT PLEASURE OF THOSE SHE LOVED WAS AT STAKE HER KINDNESS DID SOMETIMES OVERPOWER HER JUDGMENT IT WAS A BUSY MORNING WITH HIM CONVERSATION WITH ANY OF THEM OCCUPIED BUT A SMALL PART OF IT
I HOPE WE SHALL ALWAYS THINK THE ACQUAINTANCE WORTH ANY TROUBLE THAT MIGHT BE TAKEN TO ESTABLISH IT THERE IS NOTHING VERY STRIKING IN MISTER RUSHWORTH'S MANNERS BUT I WAS PLEASED LAST NIGHT WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE HIS OPINION ON ONE SUBJECT
MISSUS DASHWOOD'S VISIT TO LADY MIDDLETON TOOK PLACE THE NEXT DAY AND TWO OF HER DAUGHTERS WENT WITH HER BUT MARIANNE EXCUSED HERSELF FROM BEING OF THE PARTY UNDER SOME TRIFLING PRETEXT OF EMPLOYMENT
THAT EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE EXCEPT ONE IS IN FAVOUR OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT BUT THAT ONE IS THE TOTAL SILENCE OF BOTH ON THE SUBJECT AND WITH ME IT ALMOST OUTWEIGHS EVERY OTHER HOW STRANGE THIS IS
AND NO REASON IN THE WORLD TO THINK ILL OF TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MOTIVES UNANSWERABLE IN THEMSELVES THOUGH UNAVOIDABLY SECRET FOR A WHILE AND AFTER ALL WHAT IS IT YOU SUSPECT HIM OF
AND MADE A POINT OF BEING INTRODUCED TO HIS MOTHER AND THEN PREVAILED ON MY SISTER TO PAY THE FIRST VISIT I AM AS CERTAIN AS I SIT HERE THAT NOTHING WOULD HAVE COME OF IT FOR MISTER RUSHWORTH IS THE SORT OF AMIABLE MODEST YOUNG MAN WHO WANTS A GREAT DEAL OF ENCOURAGEMENT
IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER AND THE ROADS ALMOST IMPASSABLE BUT I DID PERSUADE HER I KNOW HOW GREAT HOW JUSTLY GREAT YOUR INFLUENCE IS WITH LADY BERTRAM AND HER CHILDREN
AND I WILL HOPE THAT HE HAS BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIKE WILLOUGHBY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM AT ONCE SECRECY MAY BE ADVISABLE BUT STILL I CANNOT HELP WONDERING AT ITS BEING PRACTICED BY HIM
TO LADY BERTRAM AND EDMUND TO DETAIL WHEREBY A MOST CONSIDERABLE SAVING HAD ALWAYS ARISEN AND MORE THAN ONE BAD SERVANT BEEN DETECTED BUT HER CHIEF STRENGTH LAY IN SOTHERTON HER GREATEST SUPPORT AND GLORY
THE HAND WHICH HAD SO PRESSED HERS TO HIS HEART THE HAND AND THE HEART WERE ALIKE MOTIONLESS AND PASSIVE NOW HER SPIRIT SUPPORTED HER BUT THE AGONY OF HER MIND WAS SEVERE SHE HAD NOT LONG TO ENDURE WHAT AROSE FROM LISTENING TO LANGUAGE
AND IT SEEMED AS IF HER TEARS WERE EVEN THEN RESTRAINED WITH DIFFICULTY SHE AVOIDED THE LOOKS OF THEM ALL COULD NEITHER EAT NOR SPEAK AND AFTER SOME TIME ON HER MOTHER'S SILENTLY PRESSING HER HAND WITH TENDER COMPASSION HER SMALL DEGREE OF FORTITUDE
AND THIS WAS SUCH A DAY I COULD NOT HELP GOING TO HIM UP IN HIS ROOM BEFORE WE SET OFF TO ADVISE HIM NOT TO VENTURE HE WAS PUTTING ON HIS WIG SO I SAID COACHMAN
BUT FOR HIS CHILDREN'S SAKE AND HE MIGHT BE THANKFUL TO HIS FAIR DAUGHTER JULIA THAT MISTER YATES DID YET MEAN TO STAY A FEW DAYS LONGER UNDER HIS ROOF THE EVENING PASSED WITH EXTERNAL SMOOTHNESS THOUGH ALMOST EVERY MIND WAS RUFFLED
BUT YOU ELINOR WHO LOVE TO DOUBT WHERE YOU CAN IT WILL NOT SATISFY YOU I KNOW BUT YOU SHALL NOT TALK ME OUT OF MY TRUST IN IT I AM PERSUADED THAT MISSUS SMITH SUSPECTS HIS REGARD FOR MARIANNE DISAPPROVES OF IT
AND WHILE THIS BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT WAS UNDER DISCUSSION
SIR THOMAS HAD BEEN QUITE INDIFFERENT TO MISTER CRAWFORD'S GOING OR STAYING
HE DID NOT SPEAK HE DID NOT BEHAVE LIKE HIMSELF YOU MUST HAVE SEEN THE DIFFERENCE AS WELL AS I WHAT CAN IT BE CAN THEY HAVE QUARRELLED WHY ELSE SHOULD HE HAVE SHEWN SUCH UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION HERE
AND THAT HE FELT FOR US THE ATTACHMENT OF THE NEAREST RELATION HAVE WE NOT PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER HAS NOT MY CONSENT BEEN DAILY ASKED BY HIS LOOKS HIS MANNER HIS ATTENTIVE AND AFFECTIONATE RESPECT
SO FAR IT WAS ALL AS SHE HAD FORESEEN BUT ON ENTERING THE HOUSE SHE BEHELD WHAT NO FORESIGHT HAD TAUGHT HER TO EXPECT THEY WERE NO SOONER IN THE PASSAGE THAN MARIANNE CAME HASTILY OUT OF THE PARLOUR APPARENTLY IN VIOLENT AFFLICTION
HE WAS GOING AWAY IMMEDIATELY BEING TO MEET HIS UNCLE AT BATH WITHOUT DELAY BUT IF THERE WERE ANY PROSPECT OF A RENEWAL OF LOVERS VOWS HE SHOULD HOLD HIMSELF POSITIVELY ENGAGED HE SHOULD BREAK THROUGH EVERY OTHER CLAIM
THE DISTRESS IN WHICH MARIANNE HAD QUITTED THE ROOM WAS SUCH AS A SERIOUS QUARREL COULD MOST REASONABLY ACCOUNT FOR THOUGH WHEN SHE CONSIDERED WHAT MARIANNE'S LOVE FOR HIM WAS A QUARREL SEEMED ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
HE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY CONDITION WITH HIS UNCLE FOR ATTENDING THEM WHENEVER HE MIGHT BE WANTED THE PLAY SHOULD NOT BE LOST BY HIS ABSENCE FROM BATH NORFOLK LONDON YORK WHEREVER I MAY BE SAID HE
HE BELIEVED HE SHOULD CERTAINLY ATTACK THE BARONET ON THE ABSURDITY OF HIS PROCEEDINGS AND ARGUE HIM INTO A LITTLE MORE RATIONALITY HE BELIEVED THIS VERY STOUTLY WHILE HE WAS IN MANSFIELD WOOD AND ALL THE WAY HOME
MISTER RUSHWORTH HAD SET OFF EARLY WITH THE GREAT NEWS FOR SOTHERTON AND SHE HAD FONDLY HOPED FOR SUCH AN IMMEDIATE ECLAIRCISSEMENT AS MIGHT SAVE HIM THE TROUBLE OF EVER COMING BACK AGAIN BUT THEY HAD SEEN NO ONE FROM THE PARSONAGE NOT A CREATURE
AND AM THE MORE CONCERNED THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MY DEAR SIR THOMAS IF YOU HAD SEEN THE STATE OF THE ROADS THAT DAY I THOUGHT WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOT THROUGH THEM THOUGH WE HAD THE FOUR HORSES OF COURSE
AND ANOTHER PAUSE SUCCEEDED THIS WAS BROKEN BY WILLOUGHBY WHO SAID WITH A FAINT SMILE IT IS FOLLY TO LINGER IN THIS MANNER I WILL NOT TORMENT MYSELF ANY LONGER BY REMAINING AMONG FRIENDS WHOSE SOCIETY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME NOW TO ENJOY
BUT MY HEART QUITE ACHED FOR HIM AT EVERY JOLT AND WHEN WE GOT INTO THE ROUGH LANES ABOUT STOKE WHERE WHAT WITH FROST AND SNOW UPON BEDS OF STONES IT WAS WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE I WAS QUITE IN AN AGONY ABOUT HIM
AFTER THE PRESENT HAPPY INTERRUPTION WITH A COURTEOUS GLANCE AT SIR THOMAS
AND IS MISSUS SMITH YOUR ONLY FRIEND IS ALLENHAM THE ONLY HOUSE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD TO WHICH YOU WILL BE WELCOME FOR SHAME WILLOUGHBY CAN YOU WAIT FOR AN INVITATION HERE
FOR I WILL NOT PRESS YOU TO RETURN HERE IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE YOU ONLY CAN JUDGE HOW FAR THAT MIGHT BE PLEASING TO MISSUS SMITH AND ON THIS HEAD I SHALL BE NO MORE DISPOSED TO QUESTION YOUR JUDGMENT THAN TO DOUBT YOUR INCLINATION
HE FELT IT TOO MUCH INDEED FOR MANY WORDS AND HAVING SHAKEN HANDS WITH EDMUND MEANT TO TRY TO LOSE THE DISAGREEABLE IMPRESSION AND FORGET HOW MUCH HE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN HIMSELF AS SOON AS HE COULD
IN SUCH A CASE A PLAIN AND OPEN AVOWAL OF HIS DIFFICULTIES WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO HIS HONOUR I THINK AS WELL AS MORE CONSISTENT WITH HIS GENERAL CHARACTER BUT I WILL NOT RAISE OBJECTIONS AGAINST ANY ONE'S CONDUCT ON SO ILLIBERAL A FOUNDATION
TO BE A SECOND TIME DISAPPOINTED IN THE SAME WAY WAS AN INSTANCE OF VERY SEVERE ILL LUCK AND HIS INDIGNATION WAS SUCH THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR DELICACY TOWARDS HIS FRIEND AND HIS FRIEND'S YOUNGEST SISTER
THE SLIGHTEST MENTION OF ANYTHING RELATIVE TO WILLOUGHBY OVERPOWERED HER IN AN INSTANT
BUT WHATEVER MIGHT BE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR SEPARATION
WHILE VINDICATING HIMSELF TO SAY NOTHING UNKIND OF THE OTHERS BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE AMONGST THEM WHOSE CONDUCT HE COULD MENTION WITHOUT SOME NECESSITY OF DEFENCE OR PALLIATION WE HAVE ALL BEEN MORE OR LESS TO BLAME SAID HE
EVERY ONE OF US EXCEPTING FANNY FANNY IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS JUDGED RIGHTLY THROUGHOUT WHO HAS BEEN CONSISTENT HER FEELINGS HAVE BEEN STEADILY AGAINST IT FROM FIRST TO LAST SHE NEVER CEASED TO THINK OF WHAT WAS DUE TO YOU
OF LOVERS VOWS IN THE HOUSE FOR HE WAS BURNING ALL THAT MET HIS EYE MISTER YATES WAS BEGINNING NOW TO UNDERSTAND SIR THOMAS'S INTENTIONS THOUGH AS FAR AS EVER FROM UNDERSTANDING THEIR SOURCE HE AND HIS FRIEND HAD BEEN OUT WITH THEIR GUNS THE CHIEF OF THE MORNING
AND NOW ELINOR WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY NOTHING FOR YOU HAVE ANTICIPATED MY ANSWER THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME THAT IT MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED
IT MAY BE PROPER TO CONCEAL THEIR ENGAGEMENT IF THEY ARE ENGAGED FROM MISSUS SMITH AND IF THAT IS THE CASE
AND THE MUSIC WHICH SIR THOMAS CALLED FOR FROM HIS DAUGHTERS HELPED TO CONCEAL THE WANT OF REAL HARMONY
AND HAD HEARD NO TIDINGS BEYOND A FRIENDLY NOTE OF CONGRATULATION AND INQUIRY FROM MISSUS GRANT TO LADY BERTRAM IT WAS THE FIRST DAY FOR MANY MANY WEEKS IN WHICH THE FAMILIES HAD BEEN WHOLLY DIVIDED FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS HAD NEVER PASSED BEFORE
THERE IS GREAT TRUTH HOWEVER IN WHAT YOU HAVE NOW URGED OF THE ALLOWANCES WHICH OUGHT TO BE MADE FOR HIM AND IT IS MY WISH TO BE CANDID IN MY JUDGMENT OF EVERY BODY WILLOUGHBY MAY UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE VERY SUFFICIENT REASONS FOR HIS CONDUCT
YOU CANNOT DOUBT YOUR SISTER'S WISHES IT MUST BE WILLOUGHBY THEREFORE WHOM YOU SUSPECT BUT WHY IS HE NOT A MAN OF HONOUR AND FEELING HAS THERE BEEN ANY INCONSISTENCY ON HIS SIDE TO CREATE ALARM CAN HE BE DECEITFUL
YOU WOULD SUPPOSE THEY WERE GOING TO BE MARRIED UNGRACIOUS GIRL BUT I REQUIRE NO SUCH PROOF NOTHING IN MY OPINION HAS EVER PASSED TO JUSTIFY DOUBT NO SECRECY HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED ALL HAS BEEN UNIFORMLY OPEN AND UNRESERVED
I WILL ATTEND YOU FROM ANY PLACE IN ENGLAND AT AN HOUR'S NOTICE IT WAS WELL AT THAT MOMENT THAT TOM HAD TO SPEAK AND NOT HIS SISTER HE COULD IMMEDIATELY SAY WITH EASY FLUENCY I AM SORRY YOU ARE GOING
EVERY ONE WAS SILENT MISSUS DASHWOOD FIRST SPOKE I HAVE ONLY TO ADD MY DEAR WILLOUGHBY
AND ABSENT HIMSELF FROM DEVONSHIRE FOR A WHILE YOU WILL TELL ME I KNOW THAT THIS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAPPENED BUT I WILL LISTEN TO NO CAVIL UNLESS YOU CAN POINT OUT ANY OTHER METHOD OF UNDERSTANDING THE AFFAIR AS SATISFACTORY AT THIS
BUT THERE WAS A SOMETHING IN SIR THOMAS WHEN THEY SAT ROUND THE SAME TABLE WHICH MADE MISTER YATES THINK IT WISER TO LET HIM PURSUE HIS OWN WAY AND FEEL THE FOLLY OF IT WITHOUT OPPOSITION HE HAD KNOWN MANY DISAGREEABLE FATHERS BEFORE
FEEL HIS MOTIVES TO DESERVE AND ACKNOWLEDGING WITH PERFECT INGENUOUSNESS THAT HIS CONCESSION HAD BEEN ATTENDED WITH SUCH PARTIAL GOOD AS TO MAKE HIS JUDGMENT IN IT VERY DOUBTFUL HE WAS ANXIOUS
IT SEEMS BUT THE WORK OF A MOMENT AND LAST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US SO HAPPY SO CHEERFUL SO AFFECTIONATE AND NOW AFTER ONLY TEN MINUTES NOTICE GONE TOO WITHOUT INTENDING TO RETURN
HER SENSATIONS WERE INDEFINABLE AND SO WERE THEY A FEW MINUTES AFTERWARDS UPON HEARING HENRY CRAWFORD WHO HAD A CHAIR BETWEEN HERSELF AND TOM ASK THE LATTER IN AN UNDERVOICE WHETHER THERE WERE ANY PLANS FOR RESUMING THE PLAY
THOUGH WE HAVE NOT KNOWN HIM LONG HE IS NO STRANGER IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD AND WHO HAS EVER SPOKEN TO HIS DISADVANTAGE HAD HE BEEN IN A SITUATION TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY AND MARRY IMMEDIATELY
BUT ALL THIS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY SUCH A SITUATION OF HIS AFFAIRS AS YOU HAVE SUPPOSED HE HAD JUST PARTED FROM MY SISTER HAD SEEN HER LEAVE HIM IN THE GREATEST AFFLICTION AND IF HE FELT OBLIGED FROM A FEAR OF OFFENDING MISSUS SMITH
HE COULD NOT HELP GIVING MISSUS NORRIS A HINT OF HIS HAVING HOPED THAT HER ADVICE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTERPOSED TO PREVENT WHAT HER JUDGMENT MUST CERTAINLY HAVE DISAPPROVED THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN VERY INCONSIDERATE IN FORMING THE PLAN
AND WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE GROUND HE ONLY REPLIED YOU ARE TOO GOOD MISSUS DASHWOOD LOOKED AT ELINOR WITH SURPRISE ELINOR FELT EQUAL AMAZEMENT FOR A FEW MOMENTS
THE REPROOF OF AN IMMEDIATE CONCLUSION OF EVERYTHING THE SWEEP OF EVERY PREPARATION WOULD BE SUFFICIENT THERE WAS ONE PERSON HOWEVER IN THE HOUSE WHOM HE COULD NOT LEAVE TO LEARN HIS SENTIMENTS MERELY THROUGH HIS CONDUCT
I WANT NO PROOF OF THEIR AFFECTION SAID ELINOR BUT OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT I DO I AM PERFECTLY SATISFIED OF BOTH YET NOT A SYLLABLE HAS BEEN SAID TO YOU ON THE SUBJECT BY EITHER OF THEM
HENRY CRAWFORD WAS AGAIN IN THE HOUSE HE WALKED UP WITH DOCTOR GRANT WHO WAS ANXIOUS TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO SIR THOMAS AND AT RATHER AN EARLY HOUR THEY WERE USHERED INTO THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE WERE MOST OF THE FAMILY SIR THOMAS SOON APPEARED
AND IS NO ALLOWANCE TO BE MADE FOR INADVERTENCE OR FOR SPIRITS DEPRESSED BY RECENT DISAPPOINTMENT
MY ENGAGEMENTS AT PRESENT REPLIED WILLOUGHBY CONFUSEDLY ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT I DARE NOT FLATTER MYSELF HE STOPT MISSUS DASHWOOD WAS TOO MUCH ASTONISHED TO SPEAK
WITH GREATER SURPRISE THEREFORE HE MUST REGARD HER ACQUIESCENCE IN THEIR WRONG MEASURES HER COUNTENANCE OF THEIR UNSAFE AMUSEMENTS THAN THAT SUCH MEASURES AND SUCH AMUSEMENTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED
YOU WILL FIND FANNY EVERYTHING YOU COULD WISH SIR THOMAS SAW ALL THE IMPROPRIETY OF SUCH A SCHEME AMONG SUCH A PARTY AND AT SUCH A TIME AS STRONGLY AS HIS SON HAD EVER SUPPOSED HE MUST
WAS QUITE OVERCOME SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND LEFT THE ROOM THIS VIOLENT OPPRESSION OF SPIRITS CONTINUED THE WHOLE EVENING SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY POWER BECAUSE SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE OF COMMAND OVER HERSELF
BUT ACTIVE AND METHODICAL HE HAD NOT ONLY DONE ALL THIS BEFORE HE RESUMED HIS SEAT AS MASTER OF THE HOUSE AT DINNER
AS TO GENERAL ATTENTION TO THE INTEREST AND COMFORT OF HIS FAMILY MUCH EXERTION AND MANY SACRIFICES TO GLANCE AT IN THE FORM OF HURRIED WALKS AND SUDDEN REMOVALS FROM HER OWN FIRESIDE AND MANY EXCELLENT HINTS OF DISTRUST AND ECONOMY
AND TOM HAD TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING WITH PROPER APOLOGIES FOR HIS FATHER'S PARTICULARITY WHAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED MISTER YATES FELT IT AS ACUTELY AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED
IT WAS OF THE UTMOST CONSEQUENCE TO HER THAT CRAWFORD SHOULD NOW LOSE NO TIME IN DECLARING HIMSELF AND SHE WAS DISTURBED THAT EVEN A DAY SHOULD BE GONE BY WITHOUT SEEMING TO ADVANCE THAT POINT SHE HAD BEEN EXPECTING TO SEE HIM THE WHOLE MORNING
IF MISTER RUSHWORTH WERE A SON OF YOUR OWN HE COULD NOT HOLD SIR THOMAS IN GREATER RESPECT SIR THOMAS GAVE UP THE POINT FOILED BY HER EVASIONS DISARMED BY HER FLATTERY AND WAS OBLIGED TO REST SATISFIED WITH THE CONVICTION
MISSUS NORRIS BEGAN TO LOOK ABOUT HER AND WONDER THAT HIS FALLING IN LOVE WITH JULIA HAD COME TO NOTHING AND COULD ALMOST FEAR THAT SHE HAD BEEN REMISS HERSELF IN FORWARDING IT BUT WITH SO MANY TO CARE FOR
IS SHE ILL I HOPE NOT HE REPLIED
WHAT HAD BEEN SO LATELY PUT UP IN THE BILLIARD ROOM AND GIVEN THE SCENE PAINTER HIS DISMISSAL LONG ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE PLEASING BELIEF OF HIS BEING THEN AT LEAST AS FAR OFF AS NORTHAMPTON THE SCENE PAINTER WAS GONE HAVING SPOILT ONLY THE FLOOR OF ONE ROOM
THEY OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN CAPABLE OF A BETTER DECISION THEMSELVES BUT THEY WERE YOUNG
AFTER THE HOUSE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF EVERY OBJECT ENFORCING THE REMEMBRANCE AND RESTORED TO ITS PROPER STATE HE DID NOT ENTER INTO ANY REMONSTRANCE WITH HIS OTHER CHILDREN HE WAS MORE WILLING TO BELIEVE THEY FELT THEIR ERROR THAN TO RUN THE RISK OF INVESTIGATION
AND HER MOTHER WHO CONCLUDED THAT A PROMISE HAD BEEN MADE BY WILLOUGHBY THE NIGHT BEFORE OF CALLING ON HER
HE COLOURED AS HE REPLIED YOU ARE VERY KIND BUT I HAVE NO IDEA OF RETURNING INTO DEVONSHIRE IMMEDIATELY MY VISITS TO MISSUS SMITH ARE NEVER REPEATED WITHIN THE TWELVEMONTH
SINCE AUGUST BEGAN WITHOUT BRINGING THEM TOGETHER IN SOME WAY OR OTHER IT WAS A SAD ANXIOUS DAY AND THE MORROW THOUGH DIFFERING IN THE SORT OF EVIL DID BY NO MEANS BRING LESS A FEW MOMENTS OF FEVERISH ENJOYMENT WERE FOLLOWED BY HOURS OF ACUTE SUFFERING
WHICH THIS SUDDEN DEPARTURE OCCASIONED ELINOR'S UNEASINESS WAS AT LEAST EQUAL TO HER MOTHER'S SHE THOUGHT OF WHAT HAD JUST PASSED WITH ANXIETY AND DISTRUST
ARE YOU GOING THIS MORNING ALMOST THIS MOMENT THIS IS VERY UNFORTUNATE
HIS DECIDED PREFERENCE OF A QUIET FAMILY PARTY TO THE BUSTLE AND CONFUSION OF ACTING HE SEEMED TO FEEL EXACTLY AS ONE COULD WISH YES INDEED AND THE MORE YOU KNOW OF HIM THE BETTER YOU WILL LIKE HIM HE IS NOT A SHINING CHARACTER
WHO WANTED NEITHER PRIDE NOR RESOLUTION WAS PREPARING TO ENCOUNTER HER SHARE OF IT WITH TOLERABLE CALMNESS
AND THERE WERE GIRLS ENOUGH ON THE CATCH FOR HIM IF WE HAD BEEN IDLE BUT I LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED I WAS READY TO MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO PERSUADE MY SISTER AND AT LAST I DID PERSUADE HER YOU KNOW THE DISTANCE TO SOTHERTON
HER ONLY RESOURCE WAS TO GET OUT OF THE SUBJECT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AND TURN THE CURRENT OF SIR THOMAS'S IDEAS INTO A HAPPIER CHANNEL SHE HAD A GREAT DEAL TO INSINUATE IN HER OWN PRAISE
ENTIRELY AT AN END LOOKING SIGNIFICANTLY AT HIS FATHER THE PAINTER WAS SENT OFF YESTERDAY AND VERY LITTLE WILL REMAIN OF THE THEATRE TO MORROW I KNEW HOW THAT WOULD BE FROM THE FIRST IT IS EARLY FOR BATH YOU WILL FIND NOBODY THERE
WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HER REMAINING AT HOME ON THEIR RETURN FROM THE PARK THEY FOUND WILLOUGHBY'S CURRICLE AND SERVANT IN WAITING AT THE COTTAGE AND MISSUS DASHWOOD WAS CONVINCED THAT HER CONJECTURE HAD BEEN JUST
SAID SHE AS SHE SAT DOWN TO WORK AND WITH HOW HEAVY A HEART DOES HE TRAVEL IT IS ALL VERY STRANGE
WITH A PURER SPIRIT DID FANNY REJOICE IN THE INTELLIGENCE SHE HEARD IT AT DINNER AND FELT IT A BLESSING BY ALL THE OTHERS IT WAS MENTIONED WITH REGRET AND HIS MERITS HONOURED WITH DUE GRADATION OF FEELING
AND I CAN PERFECTLY ACCOUNT FOR EVERY THING THAT AT FIRST SEEMED STRANGE TO ME AS WELL AS TO YOU CAN YOU INDEED YES
HE IS MOREOVER AWARE THAT SHE DOES DISAPPROVE THE CONNECTION HE DARES NOT THEREFORE AT PRESENT CONFESS TO HER HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH MARIANNE AND HE FEELS HIMSELF OBLIGED
SHE WAS NOW COOL ENOUGH TO DISPENSE WITH ANY OTHER REVENGE SHE DID NOT WANT EXPOSURE TO BE ADDED TO DESERTION HENRY CRAWFORD GONE SHE COULD EVEN PITY HER SISTER
AND EVEN SECRECY AS FAR AS IT CAN BE OBSERVED MAY NOW BE VERY ADVISABLE THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY THE ENTRANCE OF MARGARET AND ELINOR WAS THEN AT LIBERTY TO THINK OVER THE REPRESENTATIONS OF HER MOTHER
WHICH HIS ACTIONS CONTRADICTED OR TO BURY THE TUMULT OF HER FEELINGS UNDER THE RESTRAINT OF SOCIETY FOR GENERAL CIVILITIES SOON CALLED HIS NOTICE FROM HER AND THE FAREWELL VISIT AS IT THEN BECAME OPENLY ACKNOWLEDGED WAS A VERY SHORT ONE HE WAS GONE
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ODD THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE US WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING EVERYTHING TO ME AT ONCE BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE IT IS AN ENGAGEMENT IN SOME RESPECTS NOT PROSPEROUSLY BEGUN FOR THEIR MARRIAGE MUST BE AT A VERY UNCERTAIN DISTANCE
THEY SAW HIM STEP INTO HIS CARRIAGE AND IN A MINUTE IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT MISSUS DASHWOOD FELT TOO MUCH FOR SPEECH AND INSTANTLY QUITTED THE PARLOUR TO GIVE WAY IN SOLITUDE TO THE CONCERN AND ALARM
WILLOUGHBY'S BEHAVIOUR IN TAKING LEAVE OF THEM HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND AFFECTATION OF CHEERFULNESS AND ABOVE ALL HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT HER MOTHER'S INVITATION A BACKWARDNESS SO UNLIKE A LOVER SO UNLIKE HIMSELF GREATLY DISTURBED HER
HE HAD TO REINSTATE HIMSELF IN ALL THE WONTED CONCERNS OF HIS MANSFIELD LIFE TO SEE HIS STEWARD AND HIS BAILIFF TO EXAMINE AND COMPUTE AND IN THE INTERVALS OF BUSINESS TO WALK INTO HIS STABLES AND HIS GARDENS AND NEAREST PLANTATIONS
SUCH CARELESSNESS OF THE FUTURE AS YOU ATTRIBUTE TO HIM YOU MUST REMEMBER MY DEAR MOTHER THAT I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED THIS MATTER AS CERTAIN I HAVE HAD MY DOUBTS I CONFESS BUT THEY ARE FAINTER THAN THEY WERE
I HOPE NOT I BELIEVE NOT CRIED ELINOR I LOVE WILLOUGHBY SINCERELY LOVE HIM AND SUSPICION OF HIS INTEGRITY CANNOT BE MORE PAINFUL TO YOURSELF THAN TO ME IT HAS BEEN INVOLUNTARY
I HAVE NOT WANTED SYLLABLES WHERE ACTIONS HAVE SPOKEN SO PLAINLY HAS NOT HIS BEHAVIOUR TO MARIANNE AND TO ALL OF US FOR AT LEAST THE LAST FORTNIGHT DECLARED THAT HE LOVED AND CONSIDERED HER AS HIS FUTURE WIFE
PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE HAS OTHER VIEWS FOR HIM AND ON THAT ACCOUNT IS EAGER TO GET HIM AWAY AND THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH SHE SENDS HIM OFF TO TRANSACT IS INVENTED AS AN EXCUSE TO DISMISS HIM
IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF MY ABRUPT VOCAL RESPONSE BUT HE SMILED AT ME WITH A CERTAIN SMILE HE HAD OF HIS OWN
TO ONE WITH WHOM YOU HAVE NO SYMPATHY WHOM I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU TRULY LOVE FOR I HAVE SEEN AND HEARD YOU SNEER AT HER I WOULD SCORN SUCH A UNION THEREFORE I AM BETTER THAN YOU LET ME GO
WEARY WITH GATHERING WILD STRAWBERRIES IN HAY LANE HALF THE DAY HAD GONE TO BED WITH THE SUN I WATCHED HER DROP ASLEEP AND WHEN I LEFT HER I SOUGHT THE GARDEN IT WAS NOW
AND MORE EDEN LIKE IT WAS FULL OF TREES IT BLOOMED WITH FLOWERS A VERY HIGH WALL SHUT IT OUT FROM THE COURT ON ONE SIDE ON THE OTHER A BEECH AVENUE SCREENED IT FROM THE LAWN
THEN I MUST GO YOU HAVE SAID IT YOURSELF NO YOU MUST STAY I SWEAR IT AND THE OATH SHALL BE KEPT
WARBLING IN A WOOD HALF A MILE OFF NO MOVING FORM IS VISIBLE NO COMING STEP
WHILE SUCH HONEY DEW FELL SUCH SILENCE REIGNED SUCH GLOAMING GATHERED I FELT AS IF I COULD HAUNT SUCH SHADE FOR EVER
WHERE JANE TO IRELAND YES TO IRELAND I HAVE SPOKEN MY MIND AND CAN GO ANYWHERE NOW JANE BE STILL DON'T STRUGGLE SO LIKE A WILD FRANTIC
IT WOULD BE PAST THE POWER OF MAGIC SIR AND IN THOUGHT I ADDED A LOVING EYE IS ALL THE CHARM NEEDED TO SUCH YOU ARE HANDSOME ENOUGH
I DID NOT LIKE TO WALK AT THIS HOUR ALONE WITH MISTER ROCHESTER IN THE SHADOWY ORCHARD BUT I COULD NOT FIND A REASON TO ALLEGE FOR LEAVING HIM I FOLLOWED WITH LAGGING STEP
ANOTHER EFFORT SET ME AT LIBERTY AND I STOOD
THAT I CONSENT THUS TO RENDER IT SO PATIENT AND COMPLIANT ON MY PART AT LAST I SAW GEORGIANA OFF
WHICH I FEEL REBEL INSOLENTLY AGAINST MY WILL AND STRUGGLE TO EXPRESS WHAT I HAD RESOLVED TO CONCEAL BUT I HAVE A VEIL IT IS DOWN
I SEE THE NARROW STILE WITH STONE STEPS AND I SEE MISTER ROCHESTER SITTING THERE A BOOK AND A PENCIL IN HIS HAND HE IS WRITING
AND THAT ELIZA ACTUALLY TOOK THE VEIL AND IS AT THIS DAY SUPERIOR OF THE CONVENT WHERE SHE PASSED THE PERIOD OF HER NOVITIATE AND WHICH SHE ENDOWED WITH HER FORTUNE
HE DID NOT LEAVE THE STILE AND I HARDLY LIKED TO ASK TO GO BY I INQUIRED SOON IF HE HAD NOT BEEN TO LONDON
DID I SLIP AWAY FROM THE GEORGE INN ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK OF A JUNE EVENING AND TAKE THE OLD ROAD TO THORNFIELD A ROAD WHICH LAY CHIEFLY THROUGH FIELDS AND WAS NOW LITTLE FREQUENTED
AND YOU ARE PARTED FROM HIM FOR EVER AND THEN I STRANGLED A NEW BORN AGONY A DEFORMED THING WHICH I COULD NOT PERSUADE MYSELF TO OWN AND REAR AND RAN ON
NOR ATTEMPTED TO DISSUADE HER FROM IT THE VOCATION WILL FIT YOU TO A HAIR I THOUGHT MUCH GOOD MAY IT DO YOU WHEN WE PARTED SHE SAID GOOD BYE COUSIN JANE EYRE I WISH YOU WELL
BUT THAT PERFUME INCREASES I MUST FLEE I MAKE FOR THE WICKET LEADING TO THE SHRUBBERY AND I SEE MISTER ROCHESTER ENTERING
TO LONG FOR A PLENTEOUS MEAL AND A GOOD FIRE AND TO BE UNABLE TO GET EITHER NEITHER OF THESE RETURNINGS WAS VERY PLEASANT OR DESIRABLE
LOOK AT HIS WINGS SAID HE HE REMINDS ME RATHER OF A WEST INDIAN INSECT ONE DOES NOT OFTEN SEE SO LARGE AND GAY A NIGHT ROVER IN ENGLAND THERE
WELL HE IS NOT A GHOST YET EVERY NERVE I HAVE IS UNSTRUNG FOR A MOMENT I AM BEYOND MY OWN MASTERY WHAT DOES IT MEAN
OH YES SIR EVERYBODY KNEW YOUR ERRAND YOU MUST SEE THE CARRIAGE JANE AND TELL ME IF YOU DON'T THINK IT WILL SUIT MISSUS ROCHESTER EXACTLY
I DID NOT THINK I SHOULD TREMBLE IN THIS WAY WHEN I SAW HIM OR LOSE MY VOICE OR THE POWER OF MOTION IN HIS PRESENCE I WILL GO BACK AS SOON AS I CAN STIR
FULL LEAVED AND DEEPLY TINTED CONTRASTED WELL WITH THE SUNNY HUE OF THE CLEARED MEADOWS BETWEEN ON MIDSUMMER EVE ADELE
AS I SHALL NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFER EITHER TO HER OR HER SISTER AGAIN I MAY AS WELL MENTION HERE THAT GEORGIANA MADE AN ADVANTAGEOUS MATCH WITH A WEALTHY WORN OUT MAN OF FASHION
WE'LL TALK OVER THE VOYAGE AND THE PARTING QUIETLY HALF AN HOUR OR SO WHILE THE STARS ENTER INTO THEIR SHINING LIFE UP IN HEAVEN YONDER HERE IS THE CHESTNUT TREE
HERE IS THE BENCH AT ITS OLD ROOTS COME WE WILL SIT THERE IN PEACE TO NIGHT THOUGH WE SHOULD NEVER MORE BE DESTINED TO SIT THERE TOGETHER HE SEATED ME
EVENTIDE IS AS PLEASANT TO HIM AS TO ME AND THIS ANTIQUE GARDEN AS ATTRACTIVE AND HE STROLLS ON
WAS SUCH AS PROMISED WELL FOR THE FUTURE ITS BLUE WHERE BLUE WAS VISIBLE WAS MILD AND SETTLED AND ITS CLOUD STRATA HIGH AND THIN
GEORGIANA SAID SHE DREADED BEING LEFT ALONE WITH ELIZA FROM HER SHE GOT NEITHER SYMPATHY IN HER DEJECTION SUPPORT IN HER FEARS NOR AID IN HER PREPARATIONS
IN SHORT SHE'S AN EXTENSIVE ARMFUL BUT THAT'S NOT TO THE POINT
ABSENT FROM ME A WHOLE MONTH AND FORGETTING ME QUITE I'LL BE SWORN I KNEW THERE WOULD BE PLEASURE IN MEETING MY MASTER AGAIN
I HAD MADE NO NOISE HE HAD NOT EYES BEHIND COULD HIS SHADOW FEEL I STARTED AT FIRST AND THEN I APPROACHED HIM
I THAT EVENING SHUT MY EYES RESOLUTELY AGAINST THE FUTURE
I STEP ASIDE INTO THE IVY RECESS HE WILL NOT STAY LONG HE WILL SOON RETURN WHENCE HE CAME AND IF I SIT STILL HE WILL NEVER SEE ME BUT NO
I SHOULD INSIST ALSO ON YOUR KEEPING SOME OF THOSE DRAWLING HALF INSINCERE COMPLAINTS HUSHED IN YOUR OWN BREAST
DO YOU THINK BECAUSE I AM POOR OBSCURE PLAIN AND LITTLE I AM SOULLESS AND HEARTLESS YOU THINK WRONG I HAVE AS MUCH SOUL AS YOU
DURING THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS I THOUGHT OF MISSUS REED IN HER LAST MOMENTS I SAW HER DISFIGURED AND DISCOLOURED FACE AND HEARD HER
I BELIEVE YOU MUST JANE I AM SORRY JANET BUT I BELIEVE INDEED YOU MUST THIS WAS A BLOW BUT I DID NOT LET IT PROSTRATE ME
I REJOINED AND YET NOT SO FOR YOU ARE A MARRIED MAN OR AS GOOD AS A MARRIED MAN AND WED TO ONE INFERIOR TO YOU
IN LISTENING I SOBBED CONVULSIVELY FOR I COULD REPRESS WHAT I ENDURED NO LONGER I WAS OBLIGED TO YIELD AND I WAS SHAKEN FROM HEAD TO FOOT WITH ACUTE DISTRESS
ONE CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH OF SUCH A VERY EXCELLENT THING AS MY BEAUTIFUL BLANCHE WELL AS I WAS SAYING LISTEN TO ME JANE
AS HE HAD TALKED OF PURCHASING A NEW CARRIAGE SHE SAID THE IDEA OF HIS MARRYING MISS INGRAM STILL SEEMED STRANGE TO HER BUT FROM WHAT EVERYBODY SAID
HOW IS IT TO BE HELPED ARE YOU ANYTHING AKIN TO ME DO YOU THINK JANE I COULD RISK NO SORT OF ANSWER BY THIS TIME MY HEART WAS STILL BECAUSE HE SAID
WHAT BRIDE I HAVE NO BRIDE BUT YOU WILL HAVE YES I WILL I WILL HE SET HIS TEETH
IT IS MISTER ROCHESTER'S CIGAR I LOOK ROUND AND I LISTEN I SEE TREES LADEN WITH RIPENING FRUIT I HEAR A NIGHTINGALE
YOU PERFORM YOUR OWN PART IN LIFE AND BURDEN NO ONE TO MORROW SHE CONTINUED I SET OUT FOR THE CONTINENT I SHALL TAKE UP MY ABODE IN A RELIGIOUS HOUSE NEAR LISLE
I NEED NOT MAKE AN ABSOLUTE FOOL OF MYSELF I KNOW ANOTHER WAY TO THE HOUSE IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY IF I KNEW TWENTY WAYS FOR HE HAS SEEN ME
MISSUS FAIRFAX SURMISED
A NUNNERY YOU WOULD CALL IT THERE I SHALL BE QUIET AND UNMOLESTED
MYSELF LOOK OUT FOR EMPLOYMENT AND AN ASYLUM FOR YOU THANK YOU SIR I AM SORRY TO GIVE OH
FOR I DID NOT WISH EITHER CAR OR CARRIAGE TO MEET ME AT MILLCOTE I PROPOSED TO WALK THE DISTANCE QUIETLY BY MYSELF AND VERY QUIETLY AFTER LEAVING MY BOX IN THE OSTLER'S CARE
AND WHETHER SHE WON'T LOOK LIKE QUEEN BOADICEA LEANING BACK AGAINST THOSE PURPLE CUSHIONS I WISH JANE I WERE A TRIFLE BETTER ADAPTED TO MATCH WITH HER EXTERNALLY
THE SWEETEST HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR DAY ITS FERVID FIRES HAD WASTED AND DEW FELL COOL ON PANTING PLAIN AND SCORCHED SUMMIT
EVEN SINGLY OUR WAVE GIRT LAND
NOW AT THE HOUR I ARRIVE I HAVE BUT A FIELD OR TWO TO TRAVERSE AND THEN I SHALL CROSS THE ROAD AND REACH THE GATES
AND MISTER ROCHESTER LOOKED ON WITH HIS ARMS FOLDED SMILING SARDONICALLY AS IT SEEMED AT BOTH HER AND ME I HAD NOT NOTIFIED TO MISSUS FAIRFAX THE EXACT
WITH WHAT I REVERENCE WITH WHAT I DELIGHT IN WITH AN ORIGINAL A VIGOROUS AN EXPANDED MIND I HAVE KNOWN YOU MISTER ROCHESTER AND IT STRIKES ME WITH TERROR
NOW STOOPING TOWARDS A KNOT OF FLOWERS EITHER TO INHALE THEIR FRAGRANCE OR TO ADMIRE THE DEW BEADS ON THEIR PETALS A GREAT MOTH GOES HUMMING BY ME
TO A SIMILAR STRING SITUATED IN THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER OF YOUR LITTLE FRAME
WHERE YOU SIR HAVE PLACED IT BEFORE ME IN WHAT SHAPE IN THE SHAPE OF MISS INGRAM A NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN YOUR BRIDE MY BRIDE
THE EVENING ARRIVAL AT THE GREAT TOWN OF SCATTERED THESE THOUGHTS NIGHT GAVE THEM QUITE ANOTHER TURN
THE GAPING VAULT THE SILENT CHURCH THE SOLEMN SERVICE
AND HIMSELF IT IS A LONG WAY TO IRELAND JANET AND I AM SORRY TO SEND MY LITTLE FRIEND ON SUCH WEARY TRAVELS BUT IF I CAN'T DO BETTER
CUSTOM INTERVENED BETWEEN ME AND WHAT I NATURALLY AND INEVITABLY LOVED IT IS A LONG WAY I AGAIN SAID
SHE WISHED ME TO LOOK AFTER THE HOUSE TO SEE CALLERS AND ANSWER NOTES OF CONDOLENCE
IT ALIGHTS ON A PLANT AT MISTER ROCHESTER'S FOOT HE SEES IT AND BENDS TO EXAMINE IT NOW HE HAS HIS BACK TOWARDS ME THOUGHT I AND HE IS OCCUPIED TOO
AND FULL AS MUCH HEART AND IF GOD HAD GIFTED ME WITH SOME BEAUTY AND MUCH WEALTH I SHOULD HAVE MADE IT AS HARD FOR YOU TO LEAVE ME AS IT IS NOW FOR ME TO LEAVE YOU
AND MEANT TO LEAVE HIM CALMLY AN IMPULSE HELD ME FAST A FORCE TURNED ME ROUND I SAID OR SOMETHING IN ME SAID FOR ME
HOW FULL THE HEDGES ARE OF ROSES BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO GATHER ANY I WANT TO BE AT THE HOUSE I PASSED A TALL BRIAR SHOOTING LEAFY AND FLOWERY BRANCHES ACROSS THE PATH
I HAD HEARD FROM MISSUS FAIRFAX IN THE INTERIM OF MY ABSENCE THE PARTY AT THE HALL WAS DISPERSED MISTER ROCHESTER HAD LEFT FOR LONDON THREE WEEKS AGO
NOTHING TO YOU DO YOU THINK I AM AN AUTOMATON
HILLO HE CRIES AND HE PUTS UP HIS BOOK AND HIS PENCIL THERE YOU ARE COME ON IF YOU PLEASE I SUPPOSE I DO COME ON
THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE PARTED FAR OR SOON BUT WHEN AS WE THUS SAT MISTER ROCHESTER ENTERED UNANNOUNCED AND LOOKING AT US
YOU'RE NOT TURNING YOUR HEAD TO LOOK AFTER MORE MOTHS ARE YOU THAT WAS ONLY A LADY CLOCK CHILD FLYING AWAY HOME
AGAINST THE VOICE THAT KEPT WARNING ME OF NEAR SEPARATION AND COMING GRIEF
SHONE A GOLDEN REDNESS I FELT GLAD AS THE ROAD SHORTENED BEFORE ME SO GLAD THAT I STOPPED ONCE TO ASK MYSELF
IT WAS NOT A BRIGHT OR SPLENDID SUMMER EVENING THOUGH FAIR AND SOFT THE HAYMAKERS WERE AT WORK ALL ALONG THE ROAD AND THE SKY THOUGH FAR FROM CLOUDLESS
IT IS TRUE THAT WHILE I WORKED SHE WOULD IDLE AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF IF YOU AND I WERE DESTINED
BUT OF THE CRUMBS HE SCATTERED TO STRAY AND STRANGER BIRDS LIKE ME WAS TO FEAST GENIALLY HIS LAST WORDS WERE BALM THEY SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT IT IMPORTED SOMETHING TO HIM
WITH REGARD TO YOU ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE NEAR ME AS NOW IT IS AS IF I HAD A STRING SOMEWHERE UNDER MY LEFT RIBS TIGHTLY AND INEXTRICABLY KNOTTED
SEEMED TO TAKE PLEASURE IN THE SPECTACLE OF A GROUP SO AMICABLE WHEN HE SAID HE SUPPOSED THE OLD LADY WAS ALL RIGHT NOW THAT SHE HAD GOT HER ADOPTED DAUGHTER BACK AGAIN
BUT IN THREADING THE FLOWER AND FRUIT PARTERRES AT THE UPPER PART OF THE ENCLOSURE ENTICED THERE BY THE LIGHT THE NOW RISING MOON CAST ON THIS MORE OPEN QUARTER MY STEP
SHE WAS NOW AT LAST INVITED BY HER UNCLE MISTER GIBSON
BECAUSE I HAVE LIVED IN IT A FULL AND DELIGHTFUL LIFE MOMENTARILY AT LEAST I HAVE NOT BEEN TRAMPLED ON I HAVE NOT BEEN PETRIFIED
YES SIR IN DIFFERENT WAYS I HAVE AN AFFECTION FOR BOTH
AND IF THAT BOISTEROUS CHANNEL AND TWO HUNDRED MILES OR SO OF LAND COME BROAD BETWEEN US I AM AFRAID THAT CORD OF COMMUNION WILL BE SNAPT AND THEN
THE WEST TOO WAS WARM NO WATERY GLEAM CHILLED IT IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WAS A FIRE LIT AN ALTAR BURNING BEHIND ITS SCREEN OF MARBLED VAPOUR
JUST AS IF BOTH HAD PASSED THROUGH THE GRAVE AND WE STOOD AT GOD'S FEET EQUAL AS WE ARE AS WE ARE
HOW PEOPLE FEEL WHEN THEY ARE RETURNING HOME FROM AN ABSENCE LONG OR SHORT I DID NOT KNOW I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THE SENSATION
ALL I HAD NOW TO DO WAS TO OBEY HIM IN SILENCE NO NEED FOR ME TO COLLOQUISE FURTHER I GOT OVER THE STILE WITHOUT A WORD
I SHOULD ASSIGN YOU YOUR SHARE OF LABOUR AND COMPEL YOU TO ACCOMPLISH IT OR ELSE IT SHOULD BE LEFT UNDONE
YOUR STERNNESS HAS A POWER BEYOND BEAUTY MISTER ROCHESTER HAD SOMETIMES READ MY UNSPOKEN THOUGHTS WITH AN ACUMEN TO ME INCOMPREHENSIBLE
BITTERNUTT LODGE CONNAUGHT IRELAND YOU'LL LIKE IRELAND I THINK THEY'RE SUCH WARM HEARTED PEOPLE THERE THEY SAY IT IS A LONG WAY OFF SIR
BUT I'D AS SOON OFFER TO TAKE HOLD OF A BLUE IGNIS FATUUS LIGHT IN A MARSH TRUANT TRUANT HE ADDED WHEN HE HAD PAUSED AN INSTANT
STRANGELY ALTERED VOICE I MUSED ON THE FUNERAL DAY THE COFFIN THE HEARSE THE BLACK TRAIN OF TENANTS AND SERVANTS FEW WAS THE NUMBER OF RELATIVES
IN ABOUT A MONTH I HOPE TO BE A BRIDEGROOM CONTINUED MISTER ROCHESTER AND IN THE INTERIM I SHALL
THEY ARE MAKING HAY TOO IN THORNFIELD MEADOWS OR RATHER THE LABOURERS ARE JUST QUITTING THEIR WORK AND RETURNING HOME WITH THEIR RAKES ON THEIR SHOULDERS
THE VEHEMENCE OF EMOTION STIRRED BY GRIEF AND LOVE WITHIN ME WAS CLAIMING MASTERY AND STRUGGLING FOR FULL SWAY AND ASSERTING A RIGHT TO PREDOMINATE TO OVERCOME
HEARD OF A PLACE THAT I THINK WILL SUIT IT IS TO UNDERTAKE THE EDUCATION
SHE STAYED IN HER OWN ROOM HER DOOR BOLTED WITHIN FILLING TRUNKS EMPTYING DRAWERS BURNING PAPERS AND HOLDING NO COMMUNICATION WITH ANY ONE
MISSUS FAIRFAX WILL SMILE YOU A CALM WELCOME TO BE SURE SAID I AND LITTLE ADELE WILL CLAP HER HANDS AND JUMP TO SEE YOU
AND THOUGHTS BUSILY BENT ON DISCOVERING A MEANS OF EXTRICATION BUT HE HIMSELF LOOKED SO COMPOSED AND SO GRAVE ALSO I BECAME ASHAMED OF FEELING ANY CONFUSION
ITS SOLE SEPARATION FROM LONELY FIELDS A WINDING WALK BORDERED WITH LAURELS AND TERMINATING IN A GIANT HORSE CHESTNUT CIRCLED AT THE BASE BY A SEAT LED DOWN TO THE FENCE HERE ONE COULD WANDER UNSEEN
I AVOIDED SOBBING THE THOUGHT OF MISSUS O'GALL AND BITTERNUTT LODGE STRUCK
AND IN SPITE OF ME THANK YOU MISTER ROCHESTER FOR YOUR GREAT KINDNESS I AM STRANGELY GLAD TO GET BACK AGAIN TO YOU AND WHEREVER YOU ARE IS MY HOME
JANET SAID HE MAKING ROOM FOR ME TO CROSS THE STILE GO UP HOME AND STAY YOUR WEARY LITTLE WANDERING FEET AT A FRIEND'S THRESHOLD
NOT TO SEND FOR A CARRIAGE AND COME CLATTERING OVER STREET AND ROAD LIKE A COMMON MORTAL BUT TO STEAL INTO THE VICINAGE OF YOUR HOME ALONG WITH TWILIGHT
DECENTLY AND IN ORDER I SHALL EMBRACE THE TENETS OF ROME AND PROBABLY TAKE THE VEIL I NEITHER EXPRESSED SURPRISE AT THIS RESOLUTION
AT THE BOTTOM WAS A SUNK FENCE
MY JOURNEY SEEMED TEDIOUS VERY TEDIOUS FIFTY MILES ONE DAY A NIGHT SPENT AT AN INN FIFTY MILES THE NEXT DAY
I'VE A NERVOUS NOTION I SHOULD TAKE TO BLEEDING INWARDLY AS FOR YOU YOU'D FORGET ME THAT I NEVER SHOULD SIR YOU KNOW IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED JANE
HOWEVER IT IS NOT MY BUSINESS AND SO IT SUITS YOU I DON'T MUCH CARE YOU ARE IN THE RIGHT SAID SHE AND WITH THESE WORDS WE EACH WENT OUR SEPARATE WAY
OF A BALL ROOM THE OTHER THE INMATE OF A CONVENT CELL AND I DWELT ON AND ANALYSED THEIR SEPARATE PECULIARITIES OF PERSON AND CHARACTER
MY ONLY HOME I WALKED ON SO FAST THAT EVEN HE COULD HARDLY HAVE OVERTAKEN ME HAD HE TRIED LITTLE ADELE WAS HALF WILD WITH DELIGHT WHEN SHE SAW ME
HE IS FLOWN THE MOTH ROAMED AWAY I WAS SHEEPISHLY RETREATING ALSO BUT MISTER ROCHESTER FOLLOWED ME AND WHEN WE REACHED THE WICKET HE SAID TURN BACK
MISSUS FAIRFAX TOLD ME IN A LETTER AND DID SHE INFORM YOU WHAT I WENT TO
HANDBREADTH I KNEW I MIGHT BE WATCHED THENCE SO I WENT APART INTO THE ORCHARD
ONCE SHE SAID SHE HAD ACTUALLY PUT THE QUESTION TO MISTER ROCHESTER AS TO WHEN HE WAS GOING TO BRING HIS BRIDE HOME BUT HE HAD ANSWERED HER
FOR THE HOUR OF REPOSE IS EXPIRED MUST I MOVE ON SIR I ASKED MUST I LEAVE THORNFIELD
WHAT THE DEUCE HAVE YOU DONE WITH YOURSELF THIS LAST MONTH I HAVE BEEN WITH MY AUNT SIR WHO IS DEAD
CHAPTER TWELVE O GENTLEMEN THE TIME OF LIFE IS SHORT TO SPEND THAT SHORTNESS BASELY WERE TOO LONG IF LIFE DID RIDE UPON A DIAL'S POINT STILL ENDING AT THE ARRIVAL OF AN HOUR SHAKESPEARE
IF THE WOOD SMOKED IN THE BEDROOM FIREPLACE MISSUS DAVILOW WHOSE OWN WEAK EYES SUFFERED MUCH FROM THIS INCONVENIENCE SPOKE APOLOGETICALLY OF IT TO GWENDOLEN
HOW WAS THIS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE ANSWER MAY SEEM TO LIE QUITE ON THE SURFACE IN HER BEAUTY A CERTAIN UNUSUALNESS ABOUT HER
THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO NOW SAID DERONDA WORN IN SPIRIT BY THE PERPETUAL STRAIN OF THIS SCENE REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID OF YOUR TASK TO GET WELL AND CALM BEFORE OTHER FRIENDS COME
I WILL LEAD ANY LIFE YOU TELL ME BUT YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME YOU MUST BE NEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN NEAR ME IF I COULD HAVE SAID EVERYTHING TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT FORSAKE ME
DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
AND GRANDCOURT KEPT SO MANY DOGS THAT HE WAS REPUTED TO LOVE THEM AT ANY RATE HIS IMPULSE TO ACT JUST IN THAT WAY STARTED FROM SUCH AN INTERPRETATION BUT WHEN THE AMUSING ANGUISH BURST FORTH IN A HOWLING BARK
SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE
WHICH AS DERONDA APPROACHED HER PASSED INTO AN ANXIOUS TIMIDITY SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND BUT SAID HOW LONG AGO IT IS THEN WILL YOU SIT NEAR ME AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE
WHOSE FIRMNESS SHOWED ITSELF IN NO VERY GRACEFUL OR EUPHONIOUS WAY AND WHO WERE NOT ELDEST DAUGHTERS WITH A TENDER TIMID MOTHER COMPUNCTIOUS AT HAVING SUBJECTED THEM TO INCONVENIENCES
AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
SHE FELT WELL EQUIPPED FOR THE MASTERY OF LIFE WITH REGARD TO MUCH IN HER LOT HITHERTO SHE HELD HERSELF RATHER HARDLY DEALT WITH BUT AS TO HER EDUCATION SHE WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT IT HAD LEFT HER UNDER NO DISADVANTAGES
OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT
MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
THE STILL LIFE IN THE ROOM WHICH SEEMED THE STILLER FOR ITS SOBER ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE AS IF IT KEPT A CONSCIOUS WELL BRED SILENCE UNLIKE THE RESTLESSNESS OF VULGAR FURNITURE WHETHER THE GENTLEMEN WERE AGREEABLE TO EACH OTHER WAS LESS EVIDENT
HER UNCLE'S INTENTION FELL IN PERFECTLY WITH GWENDOLEN'S OWN WISHES BUT LET NO ONE SUPPOSE THAT SHE ALSO CONTEMPLATED A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE AS THE DIRECT END OF HER WITCHING THE WORLD WITH HER GRACE ON HORSEBACK OR WITH ANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT
IT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO BLAME THE RECTOR OF PENNICOTE THAT IN THE COURSE OF LOOKING AT THINGS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW HE LOOKED AT GWENDOLEN AS A GIRL LIKELY TO MAKE A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE
TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID
SHE SPOKE HESITATINGLY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THEM SAID DERONDA I WAS THINKING TOO MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL SAID GWENDOLEN SLOWLY AS IF SHE WERE OVERCOMING HER RELUCTANCE
BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY
THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME
IF WHEN THEY WERE UNDER THE STRESS OF TRAVELING SHE DID NOT APPEAR AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE TILL EVERY ONE ELSE HAD FINISHED THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HOW GWENDOLEN'S COFFEE AND TOAST SHOULD STILL BE OF THE HOTTEST AND CRISPEST
BUT THEN WE BECAME POOR ALL AT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND I WAS TEMPTED I THOUGHT I SHALL DO AS I LIKE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT I PERSUADED MYSELF AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL DREADFUL
SILENCE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GRANDCOURT SAID WHAT MEN ARE INVITED HERE WITH THEIR WIVES
WHEN YOU ARE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN YOU WILL DISCERN NEW DUTIES SAID DERONDA MAKE IT A TASK NOW TO GET AS WELL AND CALM AS MUCH LIKE YOURSELF AS YOU CAN BEFORE HE HESITATED
PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
IT IS RATHER TO BE SET DOWN TO HIS CREDIT THAT HIS FEELINGS ON THE SUBJECT WERE ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED AND IN CONSIDERING THE RELATION OF MEANS TO ENDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERE FOLLY TO HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY THE EXCEPTIONAL AND IDYLLIC
AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
THERE SEEMED TO BE A SUDDEN SUFFICIENT REASON FOR KEEPING UP THE FORMS OF LIFE AND EVEN THE WAITERS AT HOTELS SHOWED THE MORE ALACRITY IN DOING AWAY WITH CRUMBS AND CREASES AND DREGS WITH STRUGGLING FLIES IN THEM
WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH
IN THE SCHOOL ROOM HER QUICK MIND HAD TAKEN READILY THAT STRONG STARCH OF UNEXPLAINED RULES AND DISCONNECTED FACTS WHICH SAVES IGNORANCE FROM ANY PAINFUL SENSE OF LIMPNESS
IT COULD NEVER BE MY IMPULSE TO FORSAKE YOU SAID DERONDA PROMPTLY WITH THAT VOICE WHICH LIKE HIS EYES HAD THE UNINTENTIONAL EFFECT OF MAKING HIS READY SYMPATHY SEEM MORE PERSONAL AND SPECIAL THAN IT REALLY WAS
HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT
IN ORDER THAT A MARQUIS MIGHT FALL IN LOVE WITH HER OR TO HAVE INSISTED THAT SINCE A FAIR MAIDEN WAS TO BE SOUGHT SHE SHOULD KEEP HERSELF OUT OF THE WAY MISTER GASCOIGNE'S CALCULATIONS WERE OF THE KIND CALLED RATIONAL
BUT WOULD MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THE CHANCES THAT LIFE OFFERED HER AND CONQUER CIRCUMSTANCES BY HER EXCEPTIONAL CLEVERNESS
SINCE IN HIS OWN OPINION HE HAD NEVER DONE A BAD ACTION IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHOULD BE LIKELY TO COMMIT ONE IF HIS LOVE OF EASE REQUIRED IT LUSH'S LOVE OF EASE WAS WELL SATISFIED AT PRESENT
THEN THERE ARE MISTER HOLLIS AND LADY FLORA AND THE CUSHATS AND THE GOGOFFS RATHER A RAGGED LOT REMARKED GRANDCOURT AFTER A WHILE WHY DID YOU ASK THE GOGOFFS
LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
WORTH ANYTHING WORTHY ENOUGH I SHALL ALWAYS BE TOO WICKED TO THE VOICE BROKE OFF HELPLESS DERONDA'S HEART WAS PIERCED HE TURNED HIS EYES ON HER POOR BESEECHING FACE AND SAID
WHAT LUSH PUT DOWN HIS CIGAR AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS SIDE POCKETS AS IF HE HAD TO FACE SOMETHING EXASPERATING BUT MEANT TO KEEP HIS TEMPER I AM GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GIRL
YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF MUCH TROUBLE PERHAPS BUT SOME FORMS MUST BE GONE THROUGH BEFORE A MAN CAN MARRY A MILLION VERY LIKELY BUT I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY A MILLION
AND AGAIN TURNED WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION WHICH YET DID NOT ISSUE IN SPEECH THERE WAS SOME FEAR HINDERING HER AND DERONDA WISHING TO RELIEVE HER TIMIDITY AVERTED HIS FACE
AND HE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF GETTING A TOO FRISKY HORSE IN ORDER THAT GWENDOLEN MIGHT BE THREATENED WITH AN ACCIDENT AND BE RESCUED BY A MAN OF PROPERTY HE WISHED HIS NIECE WELL AND HE MEANT HER TO BE SEEN TO ADVANTAGE IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS
AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE
THE ARCHERY CLUB AND INVITATIONS TO DINE WITH THE ARROWPOINTS AS THE HIGHEST LIGHTS IN HER SCENERY WAS NOT A POSITION THAT SEEMED TO OFFER REMARKABLE CHANCES BUT GWENDOLEN'S CONFIDENCE LAY CHIEFLY IN HERSELF
SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW
IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE
AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
THE FEAR AND THE FONDNESS BEING PERHAPS BOTH HEIGHTENED BY WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE IRIDESCENCE OF HER CHARACTER THE PLAY OF VARIOUS NAY CONTRARY TENDENCIES
AND WHEN TO ALL THESE QUALIFICATIONS NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE WE ADD THE SPONTANEOUS SENSE OF CAPABILITY SOME HAPPY PERSONS ARE BORN WITH SO THAT ANY SUBJECT THEY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO IMPRESSES THEM WITH THEIR OWN POWER OF FORMING A CORRECT JUDGMENT ON IT
NOT TILL AFTER SIR HUGO HAS COME BUT WE SHALL ALL GO TO ENGLAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAID DERONDA NOT WISHING TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS
THIS POTENT CHARM ADDED TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS THE ELDEST DAUGHTER TOWARD WHOM HER MAMMA HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN AN APOLOGETIC STATE OF MIND FOR THE EVILS BROUGHT ON HER BY A STEP FATHER MAY SEEM SO FULL A REASON FOR GWENDOLEN'S DOMESTIC EMPIRE
SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD TO A SINGLE LIFE BUT PROMOTIONS HAVE SOMETIMES TO BE TAKEN WITH BITTER HERBS A PEERAGE WILL NOT QUITE DO INSTEAD OF LEADERSHIP TO THE MAN WHO MEANT TO LEAD AND THIS DELICATE LIMBED SYLPH OF TWENTY MEANT TO LEAD
BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES
AND SOONER OR LATER IT WORKS ITS WAY OUTSIDE US IT MAY BE IN THE VITIATION THAT BREEDS EVIL ACTS BUT ALSO IT MAY BE IN THE SELF ABHORRENCE THAT STINGS US INTO BETTER STRIVING I AM SAVED FROM ROBBING OTHERS
IT WAS ALWAYS SHE HERSELF WHO HAD TO BE TOLERANT TO BEG THAT ALICE WHO SAT WAITING ON HER WOULD NOT STICK UP HER SHOULDERS IN THAT FRIGHTFUL MANNER AND THAT ISABEL INSTEAD OF PUSHING UP TO HER AND ASKING QUESTIONS WOULD GO AWAY TO MISS MERRY
GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING
WHY SHOULD HE BE EXPECTED TO DIFFER FROM HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS MATTER AND WISH HIS NIECE A WORSE END OF HER CHARMING MAIDENHOOD THAN THEY WOULD APPROVE AS THE BEST POSSIBLE
WE CANNOT KILL AND NOT KILL IN THE SAME MOMENT
I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN
LUSH SPOKE CARELESSLY BUT HE WAS REALLY SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY AND FIXING AN OBSERVANT LOOK ON GRANDCOURT WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD HIS COMPANION BUT SLOWLY AND WITHOUT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN TWO LONG LUXURIANT PUFFS
ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
AND A GENTLEMAN'S DOGS SHOULD BE KICKED FOR HIM HE ONLY SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO BE KICKED IF HIS CONFIDANT HAD BEEN A MAN OF INDEPENDENT SPIRIT
THAT TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER WOULD BE TO ASK THE REASON OF DAYLIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BUT BEWARE OF ARRIVING AT CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT COMPARISON
TURN OUT THAT BRUTE WILL YOU SAID GRANDCOURT TO LUSH WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE OR LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE COUNTED ON ATTENTION TO THE SMALLEST SIGN AND LUSH IMMEDIATELY ROSE LIFTED FETCH THOUGH SHE WAS RATHER HEAVY
THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL
AND THEN HE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE GOOD GOD GRANDCOURT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL YOU LET A WHIM INTERFERE WITH YOUR COMFORTABLE SETTLEMENT IN LIFE SPARE YOUR ORATORY I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
AND ONE OF YOUR DAMNED MUSICIANS BUT NOT A COMIC FELLOW I WONDER IF KLESMER WOULD CONSENT TO COME TO US WHEN HE LEAVES QUETCHAM NOTHING BUT FIRST CLASS MUSIC WILL GO DOWN WITH MISS ARROWPOINT
I SUPPOSE YOU SENT MY CARD AND INQUIRIES I WENT MYSELF AT FOUR AND SAID YOU WERE SURE TO BE THERE SHORTLY THEY WOULD SUPPOSE SOME ACCIDENT PREVENTED YOU FROM FULFILLING THE INTENTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO TO DAY
LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE
WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH
FOR MACBETH'S RHETORIC ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING MANY OPPOSITE THINGS IN THE SAME MOMENT REFERRED TO THE CLUMSY NECESSITIES OF ACTION AND NOT TO THE SUBTLER POSSIBILITIES OF FEELING WE CANNOT SPEAK A LOYAL WORD AND BE MEANLY SILENT
EXTREMELY WELL FITTED TO MAKE A RUMPUS SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE LIKED SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU SAID GRANDCOURT WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE PERFECTLY TRUE SAID LUSH ADDING AGAIN IN A MARKEDLY SNEERING TONE
HE HELD IN HIS LAP A TINY MALTESE DOG WITH A TINY SILVER COLLAR AND BELL AND WHEN HE HAD A HAND UNUSED BY CIGAR OR COFFEE CUP IT RESTED ON THIS SMALL PARCEL OF ANIMAL WARMTH
IN WHICH A WOMAN COULD NOT DO WHAT SHE LIKED HAD MORE CHILDREN THAN WERE DESIRABLE WAS CONSEQUENTLY DULL AND BECAME IRREVOCABLY IMMERSED IN HUMDRUM OF COURSE MARRIAGE WAS SOCIAL PROMOTION
BEHOLDING A POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD SINNED HERSELF AWAY FROM
WE MUST FIND OUR DUTIES IN WHAT COMES TO US NOT IN WHAT WE IMAGINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF I TOOK TO FOOLISH WISHING OF THAT SORT I SHOULD WISH NOT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN YOU BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS
HAVE YOU FALLEN IN LOVE THIS QUESTION CARRIED A STRONG SNEER I AM GOING TO MARRY HER YOU HAVE MADE HER AN OFFER ALREADY THEN NO SHE IS A YOUNG LADY WITH A WILL OF HER OWN I FANCY
FOR SUBJECTS ARE APT TO APPEAR STUPID TO THE YOUNG AS LIGHT SEEMS DULL TO THE OLD BUT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FELT AT ALL HELPLESS IN RELATION TO THEM IF THEY HAD TURNED UP IN CONVERSATION IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD DISPUTED HER POWER OR HER GENERAL SUPERIORITY
IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT
FOR SUCH PASSIONS DWELL IN FEMININE BREASTS ALSO IN GWENDOLEN'S HOWEVER THEY DWELT AMONG STRICTLY FEMININE FURNITURE AND HAD NO DISTURBING REFERENCE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING OR THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
ALWAYS SHE WAS THE PRINCESS IN EXILE WHO IN TIME OF FAMINE WAS TO HAVE HER BREAKFAST ROLL MADE OF THE FINEST BOLTED FLOUR FROM THE SEVEN THIN EARS OF WHEAT AND IN A GENERAL DECAMPMENT WAS TO HAVE HER SILVER FORK KEPT OUT OF THE BAGGAGE
THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
GRANDCOURT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAD TWO REMARKABLY DIFFERENT VOICES HITHERTO WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAKING IN A SUPERFICIAL INTERRUPTED DRAWL SUGGESTIVE CHIEFLY OF LANGUOR
IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM
WHAT WILL GWENDOLEN THINK IF THE FOOTMAN TROD HEAVILY IN CREAKING BOOTS OR IF THE LAUNDRESS'S WORK WAS UNSATISFACTORY THE MAID SAID THIS WILL NEVER DO FOR MISS HARLETH
GAVE A VACILLATING PREFERENCE FIRST TO ONE GENTLEMAN THEN TO THE OTHER BEING DOGS IN SUCH GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY COULD PLAY AT HUNGER AND LIKED TO BE SERVED WITH DELICACIES WHICH THEY DECLINED TO PUT IN THEIR MOUTHS ALL EXCEPT FETCH
AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
BEFORE MY MOTHER COMES SAID GWENDOLEN AH I MUST BE CHANGED I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT MYSELF SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SHE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HIM IF YOU HAD MET ME NOW
THEN CAME HATRED AND WICKED THOUGHTS THAT WAS HOW IT ALL CAME I TOLD YOU I WAS AFRAID OF MYSELF
PERHAPS NOT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH THEM BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM HERE IT WAS LUSH WHO MADE A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN
WHILE HER FACE BORE PITEOUS TRACES OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT NEW TERRIBLE LIFE LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEED WHICH FULFILLS A CRIMINAL DESIRE I WILL BEAR ANY PENANCE
THAT SHE WAS TO BE MARRIED SOME TIME OR OTHER SHE WOULD HAVE FELT OBLIGED TO ADMIT AND THAT HER MARRIAGE WOULD NOT BE OF A MIDDLING KIND SUCH AS MOST GIRLS WERE CONTENTED WITH SHE FELT QUIETLY UNARGUMENTATIVELY SURE
DEEDS ARE THE PULSE OF TIME HIS BEATING LIFE AND RIGHTEOUS OR UNRIGHTEOUS BEING DONE MUST THROB IN AFTER THROBS TILL TIME ITSELF BE LAID IN DARKNESS
WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS
HER KNOWLEDGE BEING SUCH AS WITH NO SORT OF STANDING ROOM OR LENGTH OF LEVER COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MOVE THE WORLD SHE MEANT TO DO WHAT WAS PLEASANT TO HERSELF IN A STRIKING MANNER
ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE ARCHERY MEETING MISTER HENLEIGH MALLINGER GRANDCOURT WAS AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE WITH MISTER LUSH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS AGREEABLE
AND WHAT REMAINED OF ALL THINGS KNOWABLE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THROUGH NOVELS PLAYS AND POEMS ABOUT HER FRENCH AND MUSIC THE TWO JUSTIFYING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A YOUNG LADY SHE FELT NO GROUND FOR UNEASINESS
HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM
A DECISION OF WILL WHICH MADE ITSELF FELT IN HER GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS AND CLEAR UNHESITATING TONES SO THAT IF SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM ON A RAINY DAY WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS FLACCID AND THE USE OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS NOT APPARENT TO THEM
WHO CAN WONDER IF GWENDOLEN FELT READY TO MANAGE HER OWN DESTINY THERE WERE MANY SUBJECTS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS THE MAJORITY IN WHICH SHE FELT NO INTEREST BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID
AN INDISPENSABLE AND AGREEABLE GUARANTEE OF WOMANLY POWER BUT TO BECOME A WIFE AND WEAR ALL THE DOMESTIC FETTERS OF THAT CONDITION WAS ON THE WHOLE A VEXATIOUS NECESSITY HER OBSERVATION OF MATRIMONY HAD INCLINED HER TO THINK IT RATHER A DREARY STATE
AND TO HAVE THEIR LIVES BLOWN HITHER AND THITHER LIKE EMPTY SHIPS IN WHICH NO WILL WAS PRESENT IT WAS NOT TO BE SO WITH HER SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE SACRIFICED TO CREATURES WORTH LESS THAN HERSELF
SOME OF THEM WERE A VERY COMMON SORT OF MEN AND THE ONLY POINT OF RESEMBLANCE AMONG THEM ALL WAS A STRONG DETERMINATION TO HAVE WHAT WAS PLEASANT WITH A TOTAL FEARLESSNESS IN MAKING THEMSELVES DISAGREEABLE OR DANGEROUS WHEN THEY DID NOT GET IT
AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS YOU WILL GO ON MAKING THEM BUT YOU WERE THE BEGINNING OF THEM YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME SAID GWENDOLEN LEANING WITH HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM
SHALL YOU RIDE OR DRIVE TO QUETCHAM TO DAY I AM NOT GOING TO QUETCHAM YOU DID NOT GO YESTERDAY GRANDCOURT SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN SAID
HE DARED NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK AND RAOUL WENT AWAY HIS HEAD UNCOVERED ATHOS REMAINED MOTIONLESS LOOKING AFTER HIM UNTIL HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE STREET THEN THE COUNT THREW THE BRIDLE OF HIS HORSE INTO THE HANDS OF A PEASANT
BE IT SO CRIED ARAMIS CARDINALISTS OR FRONDEURS WHAT MATTERS IT LET US MEET AGAIN AS CAPITAL SECONDS IN A DUEL DEVOTED FRIENDS IN BUSINESS MERRY COMPANIONS IN OUR ANCIENT PLEASURES
THAT DEVIL PORTHOS IS A MAN OF PRODIGIOUS STRENGTH STILL IF ATHOS JOINS US
SHOWING THE SERVANT RAOUL'S SHOULDER BELT TIGHTEN THE BUCKLE OF THE SWORD IT FALLS TOO LOW YOU WILL ACCOMPANY MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE TILL GRIMAUD REJOINS YOU YOU KNOW RAOUL GRIMAUD IS AN OLD AND ZEALOUS SERVANT HE WILL FOLLOW YOU YES SIR ANSWERED RAOUL
HE SAW MOUSQUETON APPROACHING THE FACE OF THE STEWARD DESPITE ONE SLIGHT SHADE OF CARE LIGHT AS A SUMMER CLOUD SEEMED A PHYSIOGNOMY OF ABSOLUTE FELICITY HERE IS WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN
A SMALL BAG OF LOUIS CALLED OLIVAIN THE LACKEY WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM FROM BLOIS AND MADE HIM PACK THE VALISE UNDER HIS OWN EYES WATCHFUL TO SEE THAT EVERYTHING SHOULD BE PUT IN WHICH MIGHT BE USEFUL TO A YOUNG MAN ENTERING ON HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN
REMOUNTED THE STEPS WENT INTO THE CATHEDRAL THERE TO KNEEL DOWN IN THE DARKEST CORNER
WHEN I SAW YOU AT YOUR CHATEAU AT BRAGELONNE
ARE WE NOT PRETTY GOOD CHRISTIANS
HE HIMSELF FURBISHED A SWORD WHICH HE DREW FROM ITS PERFUMED LEATHER SHEATH HE EXAMINED IT TO SEE IF ITS HILT WAS WELL GUARDED AND IF THE BLADE WAS FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE HILT THEN HE PLACED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VALISE BELONGING TO THE YOUNG MAN
WAR WOULD ALWAYS BE CARRIED ON IN THE HEART OF PARIS AND WITHIN REACH OF THE CHATEAU DU VALLON
WHY REPLIED PORTHOS MOUSTON OF COURSE THIS WAS A BLOW TO D'ARTAGNAN HE COULD ALREADY SEE THE INTENDANT'S BEAMING SMILE CHANGE TO A CONTORTION OF GRIEF BUT HE SAID MOUSTON IS NOT SO YOUNG AS HE WAS MY DEAR FELLOW BESIDES HE HAS GROWN FAT
PERHAPS YOU WILL THINK SIR THAT PROSPERITY HAS SPOILED ME ART THOU HAPPY FRIEND ASKED D'ARTAGNAN AS HAPPY AS POSSIBLE
THERE WAS A SOLEMN THOUGH MOMENTARY SILENCE WHICH WAS BROKEN BY ARAMIS I SWEAR HE SAID WITH A CALM BROW AND KINDLY GLANCE BUT IN A VOICE STILL TREMBLING WITH RECENT EMOTION I SWEAR THAT I NO LONGER BEAR ANIMOSITY TO THOSE WHO WERE ONCE MY FRIENDS
IT WAS THOSE VERY TERRIBLE OLD DAYS THAT MADE THE PRESENT SO EXCESSIVELY DELIGHTFUL AND THE BLOW WAS SO GREAT HE RUSHED OUT OVERCOME AND FORGOT TO SHUT THE DOOR THE TWO FRIENDS REMAINED ALONE TO SPEAK OF THE FUTURE AND TO BUILD CASTLES IN THE AIR
IF RICHELIEU MADE THE KING BY COMPARISON SEEM SMALL HE MADE ROYALTY GREAT THE PALACE OF THE LOUVRE CONTAINS TWO THINGS THE KING WHO MUST DIE AND ROYALTY WHICH NEVER DIES
AND AS FOR ME SAID PORTHOS I SWEAR NOTHING BUT I'M CHOKED FORSOOTH IF I WERE OBLIGED TO FIGHT AGAINST YOU
TO DINNER SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHAT TIME IS IT THEN EH WHY IT IS AFTER ONE O'CLOCK YOUR HOME IS A PARADISE PORTHOS ONE TAKES NO NOTE OF TIME I FOLLOW YOU THOUGH I AM NOT HUNGRY COME IF ONE CAN'T ALWAYS EAT ONE CAN ALWAYS DRINK
NOTHING BUT A PHANTOM TO WHOM HE LENT A SOUL AND YET SO POWERFUL IS MAJESTY AMONGST US THIS MAN HAS NOT EVEN THE HONOR OF A TOMB AT THE FEET OF HIM IN WHOSE SERVICE HIS LIFE WAS WORN AWAY REMEMBER RAOUL THIS
OH CRIED MOUSQUETON REDDENING WITH JOY IF YOU DO ME SIR SUCH HONOR I SHALL BE GRATEFUL ALL MY LIFE IT IS TOO MUCH TO ASK ALAS THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN IT IS VERY LITTLE TO OFFSET THE UNEXPECTED TRIBULATIONS I AM BRINGING TO THIS POOR DEVIL
POLISH UP OR MAKE SOME ONE ELSE POLISH MY ARMS THEN TAKE PISTOLS WITH THEE AND A HUNTING KNIFE ARE WE THEN GOING TO TRAVEL MY LORD ASKED MOUSQUETON RATHER UNEASY SOMETHING BETTER STILL MOUSTON AN EXPEDITION SIR ASKED THE STEWARD WHOSE ROSES BEGAN TO CHANGE INTO LILIES
IN THE POSITION OF PORTHOS D'ARTAGNAN WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY AND TO MAKE PORTHOS CONTENTED THERE WAS WANTING WHAT FIVE LETTERS TO PUT BEFORE HIS THREE NAMES A TINY CORONET TO PAINT UPON THE PANELS OF HIS CARRIAGE
NO INDEED SIR ANSWERED RAOUL
AND PERHAPS HAS LOST HIS FITNESS FOR ACTIVE SERVICE THAT MAY BE TRUE REPLIED PORTHOS BUT I AM USED TO HIM AND BESIDES HE WOULDN'T BE WILLING TO LET ME GO WITHOUT HIM HE LOVES ME SO MUCH OH BLIND SELF LOVE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN AND YOU ASKED PORTHOS
HE HAS SET UP A LITTLE SHOP IN THE RUE DES LOMBARDS AND IS NOW A CONFECTIONER AH HE IS A CONFECTIONER IN THE RUE DES LOMBARDS
WHILST HE ADMIRED THE DELICATE TENDERNESS WITH WHICH IT WAS BESTOWED
TAKE CARE RAOUL I HAVE ALREADY OFTEN TOLD YOU OF THIS YOU MUST NOT FORGET IT FOR IT IS A GREAT DEFECT IN A RIDER SEE YOUR HORSE IS TIRED ALREADY HE FROTHS AT THE MOUTH WHILST MINE LOOKS AS IF HE HAD ONLY JUST LEFT THE STABLE
BY THE QUALITY OF THE WINE HE DIRECTED TO BE SERVED THEREFORE WHEN AT DESSERT UPON A SIGN FROM D'ARTAGNAN PORTHOS HAD SENT AWAY HIS SERVANTS AND THE TWO FRIENDS WERE ALONE PORTHOS SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHO WILL ATTEND YOU IN YOUR CAMPAIGNS
AND LET US RETAIN AS OUR BATTLE STANDARD
THESE PROCEEDINGS MADE D'ARTAGNAN AND PORTHOS DRAW BACK D'ARTAGNAN DID NOT DRAW HIS SWORD PORTHOS PUT HIS BACK INTO THE SHEATH NEVER EXCLAIMED ATHOS RAISING HIS RIGHT HAND TO HEAVEN NEVER
WELL SAID PORTHOS IF ANY ONE HAD TOLD YOU IN THE OLD TIMES THAT THE DAY WOULD COME WHEN PLANCHET WOULD RESCUE ROCHEFORT AND THAT YOU WOULD PROTECT HIM IN IT I SHOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED HIM BUT MEN ARE CHANGED BY EVENTS THERE IS NOTHING TRUER THAN THAT SAID PORTHOS
BY HIS MANNER SIR AND HIS AGE HE'S THE SECOND TO DAY HAS A YOUNG MAN SUCH AS I AM GONE THROUGH THIS MORNING THEN ASKED RAOUL FAITH YES WITH A HAUGHTY PRESENCE A FINE EQUIPAGE SUCH AS THE SON OF A NOBLE HOUSE WOULD HAVE
ALAS HE CANNOT MAKE ME FORGET WHAT I SHALL HAVE LOST THUS TALKING THEY TRAVERSED THE STREETS FULL OF PEOPLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE FETE AND ARRIVED OPPOSITE THE OLD CATHEDRAL WHERE FIRST MASS WAS GOING ON
ZOUNDS MY WEAPONS WHAT WEAPONS MY MILITARY WEAPONS YES MY LORD AT ANY RATE I THINK SO MAKE SURE OF IT AND IF THEY WANT IT HAVE THEM BURNISHED UP WHICH IS MY BEST CAVALRY HORSE VULCAN AND THE BEST HACK
D'ARTAGNAN WHO AS A GASCON WAS INCLINED TO SOBRIETY
AND WHO IN THE DARKNESS OF THIS NIGHT HEARETH US NEVER SHALL MY SWORD CROSS YOURS NEVER MY EYE EXPRESS A GLANCE OF ANGER
BUT HE DID HIS BEST TO KEEP UP WITH HIS HOST MEANWHILE HIS MISGIVINGS IN REGARD TO MOUSQUETON RECURRED TO HIS MIND AND WITH GREATER FORCE BECAUSE MOUSQUETON THOUGH HE DID NOT HIMSELF WAIT ON THE TABLE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN BENEATH HIM IN HIS NEW POSITION APPEARED AT THE DOOR FROM TIME TO TIME
MOUSQUETON INQUIRED THEREFORE THE STATE OF THE CASE OF HIS OLD FRIEND WHO CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT OF D'ARTAGNAN BUT HE ADDED IN THIS WAR PRISONERS STAND A CHANCE OF BEING HUNG THE DEUCE THEY DO SAID MOUSQUETON I THINK I SHOULD LIKE THE SIEGE OF ROCHELLE BETTER THAN THIS WAR THEN
TO FOUR MEN WHO COMPELLED SUCH A MAN AS RICHELIEU TO ACT AS WE PLEASED WHAT IS SUCH OR SUCH A PRINCE TO US WHO FIXED THE DIADEM UPON A GREAT QUEEN'S HEAD
BECAUSE OVER THIS KING WATCHED THE SPIRIT OF ANOTHER MAN EVEN AS THIS LAMP KEEPS VIGIL OVER THIS COFFIN AND ILLUMINES IT HE WHOSE INTELLECT WAS THUS SUPREME RAOUL WAS THE ACTUAL SOVEREIGN THE OTHER
PORTHOS MEANTIME ASKED D'ARTAGNAN TO GIVE HIM HIS INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO PROCEED ON HIS JOURNEY FOUR DAYS REPLIED HIS FRIEND ARE NECESSARY TO REACH BLOIS ONE DAY TO REST THERE THREE OR FOUR DAYS TO RETURN TO PARIS SET OUT THEREFORE IN A WEEK WITH YOUR SUITE
HE LOOKED LONG ON THIS YOUNG MAN WHOSE SMILING MOUTH AND HALF CLOSED EYES BESPOKE SOFT DREAMS AND LIGHTEST SLUMBER AS IF HIS GUARDIAN ANGEL WATCHED OVER HIM WITH SOLICITUDE AND AFFECTION
FOR I NEVER LOVED ANY ONE BUT YOU IN THE WIDE WORLD AND HONEST PORTHOS BURST INTO TEARS AS HE EMBRACED ATHOS MY FRIENDS SAID ATHOS THIS IS WHAT I EXPECTED FROM SUCH HEARTS AS YOURS YES I HAVE SAID IT AND I NOW REPEAT IT
WE ARE JUDGES OF WOUNDS WE OLD SOLDIERS ATHOS ADDED SMILING THANK YOU SIR ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN MUCH MOVED THEY ARRIVED THAT VERY MOMENT AT THE GATE OF THE TOWN GUARDED BY TWO SENTINELS HERE COMES A YOUNG GENTLEMAN SAID ONE OF THEM
SHOWED TO PORTHOS A BLUE RIBBON AND A DUCAL MANTLE THEY WERE IN FACT ASLEEP ON THE TABLE WHEN THE SERVANTS CAME TO LIGHT THEM TO THEIR BED MOUSQUETON WAS HOWEVER SOMEWHAT CONSOLED BY D'ARTAGNAN WHO THE NEXT DAY TOLD HIM THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY
WE LIVED TOGETHER WE LOVED WE HATED TOGETHER WE SHED WE MINGLED OUR BLOOD TOGETHER AND TOO PROBABLY I MAY STILL ADD THAT THERE MAY BE YET A BOND BETWEEN US CLOSER EVEN THAN THAT OF FRIENDSHIP
D'ARTAGNAN HE SAID YOU ARE HERE TO NIGHT STILL INFURIATED BY YESTERDAY'S ADVENTURE I BELIEVED YOUR HEART NOBLE ENOUGH TO ENABLE A FRIENDSHIP OF TWENTY YEARS TO OVERCOME AN AFFRONT OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR COME DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME
SWEAR ON THIS CROSS WHICH IN SPITE OF ITS MAGNIFICENT MATERIAL IS STILL A CROSS
BEFORE THESE MORTAL SPOILS OF THE LAST KING WHO WAS NOT TO BE PLACED BY THE SIDE OF HIS FOREFATHERS UNTIL HIS SUCCESSOR SHOULD TAKE HIS PLACE THERE AND WHO APPEARED TO ABIDE ON THAT SPOT THAT HE MIGHT THUS ADDRESS HUMAN PRIDE
JOY SHONE IN RAOUL'S EYES AND HE LEAPED LIGHTLY TO HIS SADDLE
THEN ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING RAOUL SHOULD YOU BE WOUNDED IN A BATTLE AND FALL FROM YOUR HORSE IF YOU HAVE ANY STRENGTH LEFT DISENTANGLE YOURSELF FROM THE LINE THAT YOUR REGIMENT HAS FORMED OTHERWISE IT MAY BE DRIVEN BACK
WE ARE GOING TO RETURN TO THE SERVICE MOUSTON REPLIED PORTHOS STILL TRYING TO RESTORE HIS MUSTACHE TO THE MILITARY CURL IT HAD LONG LOST INTO THE SERVICE THE KING'S SERVICE MOUSQUETON TREMBLED EVEN HIS FAT SMOOTH CHEEKS SHOOK AS HE SPOKE
ROYALTY IS THE GIFT OF GOD WHENEVER YOU HESITATE AS TO WHOM YOU OUGHT TO SERVE ABANDON THE EXTERIOR THE MATERIAL APPEARANCE FOR THE INVISIBLE PRINCIPLE FOR THE INVISIBLE PRINCIPLE IS EVERYTHING
IN RECALLING ALL HE HAD BEEN THROUGH HE FORESAW ALL THAT RAOUL MIGHT SUFFER AND THE EXPRESSION OF THE DEEP AND TENDER COMPASSION WHICH THROBBED IN HIS HEART WAS PICTURED IN THE MOIST EYE WITH WHICH HE GAZED ON THE YOUNG MAN
GENTLEMEN HE SAID OUR PRESENCE HERE IS THE BEST PROOF OF FORMER FRIENDSHIP NOT ONE OF US HAS FAILED THE OTHERS AT THIS RENDEZVOUS NOT ONE HAS THEREFORE TO REPROACH HIMSELF HEAR ME COUNT REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN
OLIVAIN TAKE CARE OF OUR HORSES AND GIVE ME MY SWORD THE TWO GENTLEMEN THEN WENT INTO THE CHURCH
WE SHOULD BE SO ON THIS OCCASION IF ONLY TO BE FAITHFUL TO OUR OATH SAID ARAMIS AH I'M READY TO DO WHAT YOU WILL CRIED PORTHOS EVEN TO SWEAR BY MAHOMET DEVIL TAKE ME IF I'VE EVER BEEN SO HAPPY AS AT THIS MOMENT
YOU SPEAK CHARMINGLY SAID PORTHOS AND ARE THE FIRST OF MEN ADDED D'ARTAGNAN YOU EXCEL US ALL ATHOS SMILED WITH INEFFABLE PLEASURE TIS THEN ALL SETTLED GENTLEMEN YOUR HANDS
SAY IT THEN IF I AM IN FAULT I WILL AVOW THE ERROR THE GRAVE AND HARMONIOUS TONES OF THAT BELOVED VOICE SEEMED TO HAVE STILL ITS ANCIENT INFLUENCE WHILST THAT OF ARAMIS WHICH HAD BECOME HARSH AND TUNELESS IN HIS MOMENTS OF ILL HUMOR
WELL WHY SHOULD NOT WE TOO BELONG TO A PARTY YOU HAD YOUR SECRET AND WE HAD OURS WE DIDN'T EXCHANGE THEM SO MUCH THE BETTER IT PROVES THAT WE KNOW HOW TO KEEP OUR SECRETS I DO NOT REPROACH YOU MONSIEUR SAID D'ARTAGNAN
THEY PROCEEDED SILENTLY TO THE CENTRE OF THE PLACE BUT AS AT THIS VERY MOMENT THE MOON HAD JUST EMERGED FROM BEHIND A CLOUD THEY THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE OBSERVED IF THEY REMAINED ON THAT SPOT AND THEREFORE REGAINED THE SHADE OF THE LIME TREES
ARAMIS STARTED BACK AND DREW HIS D'ARTAGNAN BENT FORWARD READY EITHER TO ATTACK OR TO STAND ON HIS DEFENSE
AND HE LOOKED AT D'ARTAGNAN WITH AN AIR OF REPROACH HE STAGGERED AND HIS VOICE WAS ALMOST CHOKED YES AND NO WE SHALL SERVE IN A CAMPAIGN SEEK OUT ALL SORTS OF ADVENTURES RETURN IN SHORT TO OUR FORMER LIFE THESE LAST WORDS FELL ON MOUSQUETON LIKE A THUNDERBOLT
THE HORSES ARE WAITING AND I WAS ASLEEP CRIED RAOUL WHILST YOU SIR YOU HAD THE KINDNESS TO ATTEND TO ALL THESE DETAILS TRULY SIR YOU OVERWHELM ME WITH BENEFITS
THERE WAS THIS MORNING IN HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE SOMETHING TARDY AND IRRESOLUTE HE WAS OCCUPIED WITH THE PREPARATIONS FOR RAOUL'S DEPARTURE AND WAS SEEKING TO GAIN TIME IN THE FIRST PLACE
WHICH IS THAT IN FIRING OFF YOUR PISTOL YOU HOLD YOUR ARM TOO FAR OUTSTRETCHED THIS TENSION LESSENS THE ACCURACY OF THE AIM SO IN TWELVE TIMES YOU THRICE MISSED THE MARK WHICH YOU SIR STRUCK TWELVE TIMES ANSWERED RAOUL SMILING
BUT IMAGINATION HAS THE WINGS OF AN ANGEL OF LIGHT AND TRAVELS SAFELY THROUGH OR OVER THE SEAS WHERE WE HAVE BEEN ALMOST SHIPWRECKED THE DARKNESS IN WHICH OUR ILLUSIONS ARE LOST THE PRECIPICE WHENCE OUR HAPPINESS HAS BEEN HURLED AND SWALLOWED UP
WHO SEEMS AS IF HE WERE GOING TO JOIN THE ARMY
I SHALL PASS ALL MY LIFE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN IN SEEKING FOR A MAN WHO IS REALLY CONTENTED WITH HIS LOT WHILST MAKING THIS REFLECTION CHANCE SEEMED AS IT WERE TO GIVE HIM THE LIE DIRECT WHEN PORTHOS HAD LEFT HIM TO GIVE SOME ORDERS
A CATAFALQUE RESTING ON TRESTLES OF OAK THE YOUNG MAN PREPARED FOR THIS SCENE BY THE STATE OF HIS OWN FEELINGS WHICH WERE MOURNFUL AND BY THE MAJESTY OF THE CATHEDRAL WHICH HE HAD PASSED THROUGH DESCENDED IN A SLOW AND SOLEMN MANNER
SHOULD THE KING PROVE A TYRANT FOR POWER BEGETS TYRANNY SERVE LOVE RESPECT ROYALTY THAT DIVINE RIGHT THAT CELESTIAL SPARK WHICH MAKES THIS DUST STILL POWERFUL AND HOLY SO THAT WE
NOW HATE ME IF YOU CAN BUT FOR MY OWN PART I SHALL EVER EVEN IF YOU DO HATE ME RETAIN ESTEEM AND FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU I REPEAT MY WORDS ARAMIS AND THEN IF YOU DESIRE IT AND IF THEY DESIRE IT LET US SEPARATE FOREVER FROM OUR OLD FRIENDS
THEN CALLED L'ABREUVOIR PEPIN
HE WHO FIRES THE FIRST SHOT RARELY HITS HIS MAN FOR HE FIRES WITH THE APPREHENSION OF BEING DISARMED BEFORE AN ARMED FOE THEN WHILST HE FIRES MAKE YOUR HORSE REAR
I OWE YOU EVERYTHING AND YET THIS SWORD IS THE MOST PRECIOUS GIFT YOU HAVE YET MADE ME I WILL WEAR IT I SWEAR TO YOU AS A GRATEFUL MAN SHOULD DO TIS WELL ARISE VICOMTE EMBRACE ME
OF SUCH A MAN AS YOU ARAMIS

AND OF PIERREFONDS WHICH WAS BETWEEN COMPIEGNE AND VILLARS COTTERETS BUT FORMERLY IT APPEARS BEGAN MOUSQUETON TIMIDLY OH SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE DON'T NOW MAKE WAR AS WE DID FORMERLY TO DAY IT'S A SORT OF DIPLOMATIC ARRANGEMENT ASK PLANCHET
PENETRATED INTO THE ROOM THROUGH THE WINDOW THE CURTAINS OF WHICH RAOUL HAD NEGLECTED TO CLOSE ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING HE WAS STILL SLEEPING HIS HEAD GRACEFULLY REPOSING ON HIS ARM
AT THIS MOMENT RAOUL AWOKE WITHOUT A CLOUD ON HIS FACE WITHOUT WEARINESS OR LASSITUDE
WHAT IS HE THEN WITH HIS SIXTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS YOU REMEMBER THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS HE EARNED AT THE SIEGE OF LA ROCHELLE
RAOUL AROSE AND THREW HIMSELF WITH EMOTION INTO THE COUNT'S ARMS ADIEU FALTERED THE COUNT WHO FELT HIS HEART DIE AWAY WITHIN HIM ADIEU AND THINK OF ME
AND THOSE WHOM HE RECEIVES WITH A WOODEN LADDER I COULD HAVE SPOKEN OUT WHAT ARE YOU MEDDLING WITH CRIED ARAMIS PALE WITH ANGER SUSPECTING THAT D'ARTAGNAN HAD ACTED AS A SPY ON HIM AND HAD SEEN HIM WITH MADAME DE LONGUEVILLE
WHO HAS SO WARMLY WELCOMED ME WILL MONSIEUR REMAIN LONG WITH US ASKED MOUSQUETON WITH A SERENE AND GLOWING COUNTENANCE I GO TO MORROW MY FRIEND REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN AH MONSIEUR SAID MOUSQUETON THEN YOU HAVE COME HERE ONLY TO AWAKEN OUR REGRETS
OUR DESTINIES ARE IRREVOCABLY UNITED ALTHOUGH WE NOW PURSUE DIVERGENT ROADS I RESPECT YOUR CONVICTIONS AND WHILST WE FIGHT FOR OPPOSITE SIDES LET US REMAIN FRIENDS
THAT MANOEUVRE HAS SAVED MY LIFE SEVERAL TIMES I SHALL DO SO IF ONLY IN GRATITUDE
I SEEM TO READ YOUR FUTURE DESTINY AS THROUGH A CLOUD IT WILL BE HAPPIER I THINK THAN OURS HAS BEEN DIFFERENT IN YOUR FATE FROM US YOU WILL HAVE A KING WITHOUT A MINISTER WHOM YOU MAY SERVE LOVE RESPECT
HE REMEMBERED THAT ALL THE FIRST PART OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN EMBITTERED BY A WOMAN AND HE THOUGHT WITH ALARM OF THE INFLUENCE LOVE MIGHT ASSUME OVER SO FINE AND AT THE SAME TIME SO VIGOROUS AN ORGANIZATION AS THAT OF RAOUL
BUT WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE OR CHANGES FOR THE BETTER IS WINE
AND JUST BELOW THIS LAMP THERE WAS LAID WRAPPED IN A FLOWING MANTLE OF VIOLET VELVET
YOU SAY STRANGE THINGS SAID ARAMIS YOU CAME SEEKING ME TO MAKE TO ME CERTAIN PROPOSALS BUT DID YOU MAKE THEM NO YOU SOUNDED ME NOTHING MORE VERY WELL WHAT DID I SAY TO YOU
LET US PUT OUR SWORDS INTO OUR LEFT HANDS AND SHAKE HANDS WITH THE RIGHT
GENTLEMEN NEVERTHELESS OF RANK AND CONDITION ARE AS NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH THE COLD CORPSE THERE EXTENDED I SHALL ADORE GOD SIR SAID RAOUL RESPECT ROYALTY AND EVER SERVE THE KING AND IF DEATH BE MY LOT
AND PERHAPS HE COMPREHENDED ALL THAT PASSED IN THE HEART OF THE MAN WHO WAS AWAITING HIS AWAKENING AS A LOVER AWAITS THE AWAKENING OF HIS MISTRESS FOR HIS GLANCE IN RETURN HAD ALL THE TENDERNESS OF LOVE YOU ARE THERE SIR
BUT ALAS THE POOR FELLOW DOES NOT KNOW THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH I AM HERE HE THEN MADE A SIGN FOR MOUSQUETON TO COME TO HIM SIR SAID THE SERVANT I HAVE A FAVOUR TO ASK YOU SPEAK OUT MY FRIEND I AM AFRAID TO DO SO
INSTEAD OF MAKING COMPLIMENTS TO EACH OTHER LET US EXPLAIN OUR CONDUCT TO EACH OTHER LIKE MEN OF RIGHT AND HONEST HEARTS I WISH FOR NOTHING MORE HAVE YOU ANY CAUSE OF COMPLAINT AGAINST ME OR MONSIEUR D'HERBLAY IF SO SPEAK OUT
AND HE ADDED TURNING TO PORTHOS HERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO'S OF THE SAME OPINION AS MYSELF PORTHOS WHO HAD NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD ANSWERED MERELY BY A WORD AND A GESTURE
SHOULD ANY HARM BEFALL ME YOUR NAME WILL BE THE LAST NAME THAT I SHALL UTTER THE REMEMBRANCE OF YOU MY LAST THOUGHT
THEY SET OUT PASSING OVER THE PONT NEUF
IRRITATED HIM HE ANSWERED THEREFORE I THINK MONSIEUR LE COMTE THAT YOU HAD SOMETHING TO COMMUNICATE TO ME AT YOUR CHATEAU OF BRAGELONNE AND THAT GENTLEMAN
A LOVE AS TENDER AS THAT OF A LOVER FOR HIS MISTRESS DWELLS UNDOUBTEDLY IN SOME PATERNAL HEARTS TOWARD A SON
YOURS IS A NOBLE NATURE HE SAID HERE IS YOUR SWORD RAOUL BENT HIS KNEE TO THE GROUND IT WAS WORN BY MY FATHER A LOYAL GENTLEMAN
NOW TO HORSE THAT I MAY SEE YOU DEPART RAOUL OBEYED ADIEU RAOUL SAID THE COUNT ADIEU MY DEAREST BOY ADIEU SIR ADIEU MY BELOVED PROTECTOR
YOU HOLD THE BIT TOO TIGHT AND SO MAKE HIS MOUTH HARD SO THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE HIM MANOEUVRE QUICKLY THE SAFETY OF A CAVALIER OFTEN DEPENDS ON THE PROMPT OBEDIENCE OF HIS HORSE
PORTHOS WANTED TO LENGTHEN OUT HIS NAMES MOUSQUETON TO CUT HIS SHORT WELL MY DEAR MOUSTON HE SAID REST SATISFIED I WILL CALL THEE MOUSTON AND IF IT MAKES THEE HAPPY I WILL NOT TUTOYER YOU ANY LONGER
OH SIR GOD KNOWS HOW MUCH I LOVE REVERE YOU
I CONSIDER IT WORTHY CONDUCT OF A PUPIL OF JESUITS ON SEEING D'ARTAGNAN RISE PORTHOS ROSE ALSO THESE FOUR MEN WERE THEREFORE ALL STANDING AT THE SAME TIME WITH A MENACING ASPECT OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER UPON HEARING D'ARTAGNAN'S REPLY
HAD HIS OBJECT AND REWARD BUT POOR MOUSQUETON WHOSE ONLY WISH WAS TO BE CALLED MOUSTON WAS IT NOT CRUEL TO SNATCH HIM FROM THE DELIGHTFUL STATE OF PEACE AND PLENTY IN WHICH HE WAS HE WAS THINKING OF THESE MATTERS WHEN PORTHOS SUMMONED HIM TO DINNER WHAT
AND GO TO THE HOTEL DE LA CHEVRETTE RUE TIQUETONNE AND THERE AWAIT ME THAT'S AGREED SAID PORTHOS AS TO MYSELF I SHALL GO AROUND TO SEE ATHOS FOR THOUGH I DON'T THINK HIS AID WORTH MUCH ONE MUST WITH ONE'S FRIENDS OBSERVE ALL DUE POLITENESS SAID D'ARTAGNAN
WHEN THE HILT WAS IN MY HAND AND THE SHEATH AT MY SIDE SHOULD YOUR HAND STILL BE TOO WEAK TO USE THIS SWORD RAOUL SO MUCH THE BETTER YOU WILL HAVE THE MORE TIME TO LEARN TO DRAW IT ONLY WHEN IT OUGHT TO BE USED SIR REPLIED RAOUL
BECAUSE I BENT MY ARM AND RESTED MY HAND ON MY ELBOW SO DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN YES SIR I HAVE FIRED SINCE IN THAT MANNER AND HAVE BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL WHAT A COLD WIND RESUMED ATHOS A WINTRY BLAST
EXTENDED HIS HAND WITH THE AIR OF SUPREME COMMAND WHICH CHARACTERIZED HIM ALONE DREW OUT HIS SWORD AND THE SCABBARD AT THE SAME TIME BROKE THE BLADE IN THE SHEATH ON HIS KNEE AND THREW THE PIECES TO HIS RIGHT THEN TURNING TO ARAMIS
TIS ONLY BECAUSE MONSIEUR DE LA FERE HAS SPOKEN OF FRIENDSHIP THAT I QUESTION YOUR CONDUCT
AND I EVEN I OPPOSED THE DESIGNS OF THE GREAT MAN WHO HELD THE DESTINIES OF FRANCE WITHIN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND RAOUL LEARN HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE KING FROM ROYALTY THE KING IS BUT A MAN
HE SAID RESPECTFULLY YES RAOUL REPLIED THE COUNT AND YOU DID NOT AWAKEN ME I WISHED TO LEAVE YOU STILL TO ENJOY SOME MOMENTS OF SLEEP MY CHILD YOU MUST BE FATIGUED FROM YESTERDAY OH SIR HOW GOOD YOU ARE
SO FRESH HIS OWN YOUTH SEEMED TO REAPPEAR BRINGING WITH IT ALL THOSE SAVOURY REMEMBRANCES WHICH ARE LIKE PERFUMES MORE THAN THOUGHTS BETWEEN THE PAST AND THE PRESENT WAS AN INEFFABLE ABYSS
SO SURE TO BE EXALTED BY THE GLORIES OF A THRONE DUST OF THE EARTH HERE I AWAIT THEE THERE WAS PROFOUND SILENCE
AND POINTING TO THE COFFIN THIS TEMPORARY SEPULTURE IS HE SAID THAT OF A MAN WHO WAS OF FEEBLE MIND YET ONE WHOSE REIGN WAS FULL OF GREAT EVENTS
WHO BOWED AND PROCEEDED TOWARD THE BASEMENT COME RAOUL HE SAID LET US FOLLOW THIS MAN THE VERGER OPENED THE IRON GRATING THAT GUARDED THE ROYAL TOMBS AND STOOD ON THE TOPMOST STEP
ASHAMED OF SO MUCH ATTENTION IN AN INSTANT I SHALL BE DRESSED ATHOS THEN CALLED OLIVAIN
AFTER SPEAKING IN A LOW VOICE TO THE LACKEY WHO INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THEM IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THEIR ROOMS RAOUL DELIGHTED AT THE COUNT'S COMPANIONSHIP PERCEIVED OR AFFECTED TO PERCEIVE NOTHING OF THIS BYPLAY
AND HE WIPED HIS EYES STILL MOIST HAS NOT ONE OF YOU A CROSS ASKED ATHOS ARAMIS SMILED AND DREW FROM HIS VEST A CROSS OF DIAMONDS WHICH WAS HUNG AROUND HIS NECK BY A CHAIN OF PEARLS HERE IS ONE HE SAID
SINCE I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF BEING MY LORD'S STEWARD I HAVE TAKEN THE LAST NAME AS MORE DIGNIFIED AND CALCULATED TO MAKE MY INFERIORS RESPECT ME YOU SIR KNOW HOW NECESSARY SUBORDINATION IS IN ANY LARGE ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVANTS D'ARTAGNAN SMILED
HOW DO YOU FEEL THIS MORNING HE INQUIRED PERFECTLY WELL QUITE RESTED SIR YOU ARE STILL GROWING ATHOS CONTINUED WITH THAT CHARMING AND PATERNAL INTEREST FELT BY A GROWN MAN FOR A YOUTH OH SIR I BEG YOUR PARDON EXCLAIMED RAOUL
PLANCHET YES I HAVE FOUND HIM AGAIN
OH NO NO DO NOT GO AWAY EXCLAIMED D'ARTAGNAN IMPELLED BY ONE OF THOSE IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSES WHICH SHOWED THE NOBILITY OF HIS NATURE THE NATIVE BRIGHTNESS OF HIS CHARACTER I SWEAR THAT I WOULD GIVE THE LAST DROP OF MY BLOOD AND THE LAST FRAGMENT OF MY LIMBS
