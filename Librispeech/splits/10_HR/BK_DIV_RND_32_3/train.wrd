FEARING SOME ACCIDENT HAD HAPPENED AND THAT SHE HAD SENT JAMES OFF ON JUSTICE THE ROAN COB TOWARD THE WOODEN BRIDGE TO MAKE INQUIRY AFTER US WE SAW A LIGHT AT THE HALL DOOR AND AT THE UPPER WINDOWS
OF COURSE I COULD NOT TELL HIM BUT I KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE BRIDGE WAS NOT SAFE
THE RIVER BANKS WERE RATHER HIGH AND THE BRIDGE INSTEAD OF RISING WENT ACROSS JUST LEVEL SO THAT IN THE MIDDLE IF THE RIVER WAS FULL THE WATER WOULD BE NEARLY UP TO THE WOODWORK AND PLANKS
WHILE THE STRONG VAPORS THAT ROSE MADE MY EYES SMART AND INFLAME AND I DID NOT FEEL THE SAME APPETITE FOR MY FOOD ONE DAY HIS MASTER CAME IN AND SAID ALFRED THE STABLE SMELLS RATHER STRONG
TWO DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT BLANTYRE PAID ME A VISIT HE PATTED ME AND PRAISED ME VERY MUCH HE TOLD LORD GEORGE THAT HE WAS SURE THE HORSE KNEW OF ANNIE'S DANGER AS WELL AS HE DID
ANOTHER BEND AND SHE WAS HIDDEN AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES WE CAUGHT GLIMPSES AND THEN LOST THEM WE SCARCELY SEEMED TO GAIN GROUND UPON THEM AT ALL AN OLD ROAD MENDER WAS STANDING NEAR A HEAP OF STONES
COMING FROM THE BETTER PART OF THE FAIR I NOTICED A MAN WHO LOOKED LIKE A GENTLEMAN FARMER WITH A YOUNG BOY BY HIS SIDE HE HAD A BROAD BACK AND ROUND SHOULDERS A KIND RUDDY FACE
TO THE COMMON TO THE COMMON SIR SHE HAS TURNED OFF THERE I KNEW THIS COMMON VERY WELL IT WAS FOR THE MOST PART VERY UNEVEN GROUND COVERED WITH HEATHER AND DARK GREEN FURZE BUSHES
AND THE ROAD IS VERY STEEP I AM SURE HE IS DOING HIS BEST IF DOING HIS BEST WON'T GET THIS LOAD UP HE MUST DO SOMETHING MORE THAN HIS BEST THAT'S ALL I KNOW MA'AM SAID JAKES
WHILE OTHERS WOULD TAKE THEIR HANDS GENTLY OVER ONE'S BODY WITH A PAT NOW AND THEN AS MUCH AS TO SAY BY YOUR LEAVE OF COURSE I JUDGED A GOOD DEAL OF THE BUYERS BY THEIR MANNERS TO MYSELF
I MADE TWO SUCH SERIOUS STUMBLES THAT AS HE CAME DOWN LANSDOWN INTO THE CITY HE STOPPED AT THE FARRIER'S AND ASKED HIM TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH ME
AND THE HEAD GROOM WAS LEFT IN CHARGE THE LADY HARRIET WHO REMAINED AT THE HALL WAS A GREAT INVALID AND NEVER WENT OUT IN THE CARRIAGE AND THE LADY ANNE PREFERRED RIDING ON HORSEBACK WITH HER BROTHER OR COUSINS
THE MAN LAUGHED YOU SEE SHE SAID YOU DO NOT GIVE HIM A FAIR CHANCE HE CANNOT USE ALL HIS POWER WITH HIS HEAD HELD BACK AS IT IS WITH THAT CHECK REIN
THE MONEY WAS PAID ON THE SPOT AND MY NEW MASTER TOOK MY HALTER AND LED ME OUT OF THE FAIR TO AN INN WHERE HE HAD A SADDLE AND BRIDLE READY HE GAVE ME A GOOD FEED OF OATS AND STOOD BY WHILE I ATE IT
AND GOT THERE JUST AS THE DOCTOR RODE UP THERE WAS A WOMAN SITTING ON THE GROUND WITH THE LADY'S HEAD IN HER LAP THE DOCTOR POURED SOMETHING INTO HER MOUTH BUT ALL THAT I HEARD WAS SHE IS NOT DEAD THEN I WAS LED OFF BY A MAN
I WAS PUT WITH TWO OR THREE OTHER STRONG USEFUL LOOKING HORSES AND A GOOD MANY PEOPLE CAME TO LOOK AT US THE GENTLEMEN ALWAYS TURNED FROM ME WHEN THEY SAW MY BROKEN KNEES
YOU HAD BETTER HAVE HIM KILLED OUT OF HAND BUT HE IS NOT THERE IS A SALE OF HORSES COMING OFF IN ABOUT TEN DAYS IF YOU REST HIM AND FEED HIM UP HE MAY PICK UP AND YOU MAY GET MORE THAN HIS SKIN IS WORTH AT ANY RATE
HOW IS THIS HE SAID ARE YOU TIRED OF YOUR GOOD BLACK AUSTER OH NO NOT AT ALL SHE REPLIED BUT I AM AMIABLE ENOUGH TO LET YOU RIDE HIM FOR ONCE
FOR THERE WAS A WHOLE TRAIN OF CABS AND CARRIAGES ALL GOING OUR WAY AT A QUICK TROT PERHAPS WANTING TO CATCH THAT VERY TRAIN AT ANY RATE WE WHIRLED INTO THE STATION WITH MANY MORE JUST AS THE GREAT CLOCK POINTED TO EIGHT MINUTES TO TWELVE O'CLOCK
HE SAID BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT THE FOREMAN CAME JUST AS WE WERE STARTING AND WOULD HAVE THREE HUNDREDWEIGHT MORE PUT ON TO SAVE HIM TROUBLE AND I MUST GET ON WITH IT AS WELL AS I CAN
AGAIN I STARTED THE HEAVY LOAD AND STRUGGLED ON A FEW YARDS AGAIN THE WHIP CAME DOWN AND AGAIN I STRUGGLED FORWARD THE PAIN OF THAT GREAT CART WHIP WAS SHARP
AND SOME CORDIAL WAS POURED INTO MY MOUTH AND SOMETHING WAS COVERED OVER ME I CANNOT TELL HOW LONG I LAY THERE BUT I FOUND MY LIFE COMING BACK AND A KIND VOICED MAN WAS PATTING ME
I AM SURE HE MAKES FRIENDS OF THEM IF EVER A MAN DID AT LAST WE CAME TO THE PARK GATES AND FOUND THE GARDENER LOOKING OUT FOR US HE SAID THAT MISTRESS HAD BEEN IN A DREADFUL WAY EVER SINCE DARK
SHE WAS UNCOMMON GOOD TO MY WIFE IN THE WINTER THEN MOUNT THIS HORSE MY FRIEND YOUR NECK WILL BE QUITE SAFE AND RIDE TO THE DOCTOR'S AND ASK HIM TO COME INSTANTLY
I THINK THE DRAIN DOES SOMETIMES SEND BACK A SMELL THERE MAY BE SOMETHING WRONG SIR
I NEVER KNEW TILL NOW THE UTTER MISERY OF A CAB HORSE'S LIFE SKINNER HAD A LOW SET OF CABS AND A LOW SET OF DRIVERS HE WAS HARD ON THE MEN AND THE MEN
IN FACT HE DID A GREAT DEAL OF STROKING AND PATTING
SOME OF THEM LOOKED AS IF POVERTY AND HARD TIMES HAD HARDENED THEM ALL OVER BUT THERE WERE OTHERS THAT I WOULD HAVE WILLINGLY USED THE LAST OF MY STRENGTH IN SERVING POOR AND SHABBY BUT KIND AND HUMAN
CAN YOUR HORSE DO IT OR CAN'T HE SAID THE BLUSTERING MAN
WE CALL THEM DUMB ANIMALS AND SO THEY ARE FOR THEY CANNOT TELL US HOW THEY FEEL BUT THEY DO NOT SUFFER LESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO WORDS BUT I MUST NOT DETAIN YOU NOW
AND I MADE A DEAD STOP GO ON BEAUTY SAID MY MASTER AND HE GAVE ME A TOUCH WITH THE WHIP BUT I DARE NOT STIR HE GAVE ME A SHARP CUT I JUMPED BUT I DARE NOT GO FORWARD
SOON BEGAN TO TELL ON MY CONDITION AND MY SPIRITS I HAD A GOOD CONSTITUTION FROM MY MOTHER AND I WAS NEVER STRAINED WHEN I WAS YOUNG SO THAT I HAD A BETTER CHANCE THAN MANY HORSES WHO HAVE BEEN WORKED BEFORE THEY CAME TO THEIR FULL STRENGTH
WE HAD HARDLY TURNED ON THE COMMON WHEN WE CAUGHT SIGHT AGAIN OF THE GREEN HABIT FLYING ON BEFORE US MY LADY'S HAT WAS GONE AND HER LONG BROWN HAIR WAS STREAMING BEHIND HER HER HEAD AND BODY WERE THROWN BACK
THIS IS A CASE OF OVERWORK MORE THAN DISEASE
BUT HERE THERE WAS NO REST AND MY DRIVER WAS JUST AS HARD AS HIS MASTER HE HAD A CRUEL WHIP WITH SOMETHING SO SHARP AT THE END THAT IT SOMETIMES DREW BLOOD
THAT USED TO COOL US DOWN AND MAKE US SO COMFORTABLE THEN WE HAD TWO NIGHTS AND A WHOLE DAY FOR UNBROKEN REST AND ON MONDAY MORNING WE WERE AS FRESH AS YOUNG HORSES AGAIN
BUT NOW THERE IS NOT AN OUNCE OF STRENGTH LEFT IN HIM
HOW IT ENDED IT MUST HAVE BEEN NEARLY MIDNIGHT WHEN I HEARD AT A GREAT DISTANCE THE SOUND OF A HORSE'S FEET SOMETIMES THE SOUND DIED AWAY THEN IT GREW CLEARER AGAIN
BUT NOW WITH A LIGHT HAND AND A PRACTICED EYE HE GUIDED ME OVER THE GROUND IN SUCH A MASTERLY MANNER THAT MY PACE WAS SCARCELY SLACKENED AND WE WERE DECIDEDLY GAINING ON THEM
AND ENCOURAGING ME TO RISE AFTER SOME MORE CORDIAL HAD BEEN GIVEN ME AND AFTER ONE OR TWO ATTEMPTS I STAGGERED TO MY FEET AND WAS GENTLY LED TO SOME STABLES WHICH WERE CLOSE BY
I WAS SUFFICIENTLY RECOVERED TO BE LED BACK TO SKINNER'S STABLES WHERE I THINK THEY DID THE BEST FOR ME THEY COULD IN THE MORNING SKINNER CAME WITH A FARRIER TO LOOK AT ME HE EXAMINED ME VERY CLOSELY AND SAID
BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I SHALL BE THE LESS HAPPY FOR THAT I HAVE HEARD THE COMMANDMENTS READ A GREAT MANY TIMES AND I NEVER NOTICED THAT ANY OF THEM SAID THOU SHALT BE RICH AND THERE ARE A GOOD MANY CURIOUS THINGS SAID IN THE NEW TESTAMENT ABOUT RICH MEN
SAID SHE PATTING AND STROKING ME WITH HER GENTLE HAND AND NOW IF YOU WILL SPEAK KINDLY TO HIM AND LEAD HIM ON I BELIEVE HE WILL BE ABLE TO DO BETTER JAKES TOOK THE REIN COME ON BLACKIE
UPON THIS ADVICE SKINNER RATHER UNWILLINGLY I THINK GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD BE WELL FED AND CARED FOR AND THE STABLE MAN HAPPILY FOR ME CARRIED OUT THE ORDERS
AND WHETHER IT WAS THE STUPID COLT OR THE LOUD CRACKING OF THE WHIP
PLEASE TO OPEN THE DOOR AND LET US LOSE NO TIME THE NEXT MINUTE JERRY WAS ON THE BOX WITH A CHEERY CHIRRUP TO ME AND A TWITCH OF THE REIN THAT I WELL UNDERSTOOD NOW THEN JACK MY BOY SAID HE SPIN ALONG
AND TWOULD BE WORTH A GENTLEMAN'S WHILE TO GIVE A FIVE POUND NOTE FOR HIM AND LET HIM HAVE A CHANCE I'LL BE BOUND HE'D BE WORTH TWENTY POUNDS NEXT SPRING THE OLD GENTLEMAN LAUGHED AND THE LITTLE BOY LOOKED UP EAGERLY
LOOK AT HIS MANE AND TAIL I WISH YOU WOULD LOOK INTO HIS MOUTH AND THEN YOU COULD TELL THOUGH HE IS SO VERY THIN HIS EYES ARE NOT SUNK LIKE SOME OLD HORSES THE OLD GENTLEMAN LAUGHED
I WAS STRUGGLING TO KEEP ON GOADED BY CONSTANT CHUCKS OF THE REIN AND USE OF THE WHIP WHEN IN A SINGLE MOMENT I CANNOT TELL HOW
WE'LL SHOW THEM HOW WE CAN GET OVER THE GROUND IF WE ONLY KNOW WHY IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO DRIVE FAST IN THE CITY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN THE STREETS ARE FULL OF TRAFFIC BUT WE DID WHAT COULD BE DONE AND WHEN A GOOD DRIVER
AND LEANING A LITTLE FORWARD WE DASHED AFTER THEM FOR ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF THE ROAD RAN STRAIGHT AND THEN BENT TO THE RIGHT AFTER WHICH IT DIVIDED INTO TWO ROADS
AND SOME WITH OLD SORES ON THEIR BACKS AND HIPS THESE WERE SAD SIGHTS FOR A HORSE TO LOOK UPON WHO KNOWS NOT BUT HE MAY COME TO THE SAME STATE THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF BARGAINING OF RUNNING UP AND BEATING DOWN
AND WAS THEN GENTLY RIDDEN HOME BY A SERVANT OF MY NEW MASTER'S AND TURNED INTO A LARGE MEADOW WITH A SHED IN ONE CORNER OF IT MISTER THOROUGHGOOD FOR THAT WAS THE NAME OF MY BENEFACTOR
AND QUICK IN ALL HIS MOTIONS I KNEW IN A MOMENT BY THE WAY HE HANDLED ME THAT HE WAS USED TO HORSES HE SPOKE GENTLY AND HIS GRAY EYE HAD A KINDLY CHEERY LOOK IN IT IT MAY SEEM STRANGE TO SAY
AND SLEPT IN SPITE OF THE PAIN THE NEXT DAY AFTER THE FARRIER HAD EXAMINED MY WOUNDS HE SAID HE HOPED THE JOINT WAS NOT INJURED AND IF SO I SHOULD NOT BE SPOILED FOR WORK
LOOSENED HER COLLAR FELT HER HANDS AND WRIST THEN STARTED UP AND LOOKED WILDLY ROUND HIM FOR HELP AT NO GREAT DISTANCE THERE WERE TWO MEN CUTTING TURF WHO SEEING LIZZIE RUNNING WILD WITHOUT A RIDER
AND HE WORE A BROAD BRIMMED HAT WHEN HE CAME UP TO ME AND MY COMPANIONS HE STOOD STILL AND GAVE A PITIFUL LOOK ROUND UPON US I SAW HIS EYE REST ON ME
THE YOUNG MAN PUT HIS HEAD OUT AND SAID ANXIOUSLY I THINK I HAD BETTER GET OUT AND WALK I SHALL NEVER GET THERE IF THIS GOES ON I'LL DO ALL THAT CAN BE DONE SIR SAID JERRY I THINK WE SHALL BE IN TIME
I'M AFRAID IT HAS BEEN THE OLD THING OVER AGAIN POOR SUSAN SHE LOOKED AWFULLY PALE WHEN SHE CAME TO MY HOUSE TO ASK IF HE HAD NOT COME HOME SHE MADE BELIEVE SHE WAS NOT A BIT ANXIOUS
AND TO HIRE WHEN HE WANTED ONE I WAS THEREFORE KEPT TILL MY FEET WERE QUITE SOUND
AGAIN AND AGAIN I NEIGHED PAWING THE GROUND IMPATIENTLY AND TOSSING MY HEAD TO GET THE REIN LOOSE I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BLANTYRE CAME RUNNING TO THE GATE HE LOOKED ANXIOUSLY ABOUT
GAVE ORDERS THAT I SHOULD HAVE HAY AND OATS EVERY NIGHT AND MORNING AND THE RUN OF THE MEADOW DURING THE DAY AND YOU WILLIE
NO SMELL OF OLD BEER AND TOBACCO WHICH I HATED BUT A FRESH SMELL AS IF HE HAD COME OUT OF A HAYLOFT HE OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS FOR ME BUT THAT WAS REFUSED AND HE WALKED AWAY
WITH GREAT PAIN I AM SURE HE WAS SORRY FOR ME FOR HE OFTEN PATTED AND ENCOURAGED ME TALKING TO ME IN A PLEASANT VOICE AT LAST I REACHED MY OWN BOX AND HAD SOME CORN
SOMETIMES ON A SUNDAY MORNING A PARTY OF FAST MEN WOULD HIRE THE CAB FOR THE DAY FOUR OF THEM INSIDE AND ANOTHER WITH THE DRIVER AND I HAD TO TAKE THEM TEN OR FIFTEEN MILES OUT INTO THE COUNTRY AND BACK AGAIN
MY NEW MASTER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HE HAD BLACK EYES AND A HOOKED NOSE HIS MOUTH WAS AS FULL OF TEETH AS A BULL DOG'S AND HIS VOICE WAS AS HARSH AS THE GRINDING OF CART WHEELS
SO PLEASE HELP ME TO MOUNT LIKE A GOOD FRIEND AS YOU ARE THERE WAS NO MORE TO BE SAID HE PLACED HER CAREFULLY ON THE SADDLE LOOKED TO THE BIT AND CURB GAVE THE REINS GENTLY INTO HER HAND AND THEN MOUNTED ME
HE WAS RAISING THE WHIP AGAIN WHEN THE LADY SAID
I PUT DOWN MY HEAD AND THREW MY WHOLE WEIGHT AGAINST THE COLLAR I SPARED NO STRENGTH THE LOAD MOVED ON AND I PULLED IT STEADILY UP THE HILL AND THEN STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
WITH VOICES THAT I COULD TRUST THERE WAS ONE TOTTERING OLD MAN WHO TOOK A GREAT FANCY TO ME AND I TO HIM BUT I WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH IT WAS AN ANXIOUS TIME
LONG STRINGS OF YOUNG HORSES OUT OF THE COUNTRY FRESH FROM THE MARSHES AND DROVES OF SHAGGY LITTLE WELSH PONIES NO HIGHER THAN MERRYLEGS AND HUNDREDS OF CART HORSES OF ALL SORTS
I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND MUCH OF WHAT THEY SAID BUT I FOUND THEY THOUGHT IF I HAD GONE ON AS THE MASTER WANTED ME MOST LIKELY THE BRIDGE WOULD HAVE GIVEN WAY UNDER US AND HORSE CHAISE MASTER
HE WOULD SAY BUT HE IS IMPROVING SO STEADILY THAT I THINK WE SHALL SEE A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER IN THE SPRING THE PERFECT REST THE GOOD FOOD THE SOFT TURF AND GENTLE EXERCISE
BLESS THE BOY HE IS AS HORSEY AS HIS OLD GRANDFATHER BUT DO LOOK AT HIS MOUTH GRANDPAPA AND ASK THE PRICE I AM SURE HE WOULD GROW YOUNG IN OUR MEADOWS
BUT HE WALKED OFF ONE OR TWO MORE CAME WHO DID NOT MEAN BUSINESS THEN THE HARD FACED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN AND OFFERED TWENTY THREE POUNDS A VERY CLOSE BARGAIN WAS BEING DRIVEN FOR MY SALESMAN
AT LAST IN PASSING THROUGH ONE WE CAME TO A LONG CAB STAND WHEN MY RIDER CALLED OUT IN A CHEERY VOICE GOOD NIGHT GOVERNOR HALLOO CRIED A VOICE HAVE YOU GOT A GOOD ONE I THINK SO REPLIED MY OWNER
AT THE KNACKER'S OR ELSEWHERE
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG SIR SAID JOHN AND HE SPRANG OUT OF THE DOG CART AND CAME TO MY HEAD AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HE TRIED TO LEAD ME FORWARD COME ON BEAUTY WHAT'S THE MATTER
MAY OPEN HER EYES SOON THEN SEEING THE OTHER MAN HE CALLED OUT HERE JOE RUN FOR SOME WATER AND TELL MY MISSIS
I COULD HEAR A POLICEMAN GIVING ORDERS BUT I DID NOT EVEN OPEN MY EYES I COULD ONLY DRAW A GASPING BREATH NOW AND THEN SOME COLD WATER WAS THROWN OVER MY HEAD
STAYING AT THE HALL HE ALWAYS RODE LIZZIE AND PRAISED HER SO MUCH THAT ONE DAY LADY ANNE ORDERED THE SIDE SADDLE TO BE PUT ON HER AND THE OTHER SADDLE ON ME WHEN WE CAME TO THE DOOR THE GENTLEMAN SEEMED VERY UNEASY
BUT I SHOULD NEVER LOSE THE BLEMISH I BELIEVE THEY DID THE BEST TO MAKE A GOOD CURE BUT IT WAS A LONG AND PAINFUL ONE PROUD FLESH AS THEY CALLED IT CAME UP IN MY KNEES AND WAS BURNED OUT WITH CAUSTIC
AND YOU WON'T FIND A CURSE COME WITH YOUR WEALTH AS FOR YOU LARRY YOU'LL DIE POOR YOU SPEND TOO MUCH IN WHIPCORD WELL SAID LARRY WHAT IS A FELLOW TO DO IF HIS HORSE WON'T GO WITHOUT IT
AND I MUST DO HIM THE JUSTICE TO SAY THAT HE LET MY REIN OUT SEVERAL HOLES AND GOING UPHILL AFTER THAT HE ALWAYS GAVE ME MY HEAD BUT THE HEAVY LOADS WENT ON
LET ME BEG YOU TO HAVE THE SADDLES CHANGED MY DEAR COUSIN SAID LADY ANNE LAUGHING PRAY DO NOT TROUBLE YOUR GOOD CAREFUL HEAD ABOUT ME I HAVE BEEN A HORSEWOMAN EVER SINCE I WAS A BABY
AND BE QUICK AS A RAT DOG TO SEE IF THERE BE ROOM AND IF THERE BE TIME LEST YOU GET YOUR OWN WHEELS LOCKED OR SMASHED OR THE SHAFT OF SOME OTHER VEHICLE RUN INTO YOUR CHEST OR SHOULDER ALL THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR
IT MAINTAINED ITS ASTOUNDING EQUILIBRIUM AMIDST A THUNDER OF APPLAUSE THE AUDIENCE DISPERSED AT LAST DISCUSSING HOW FAR THEY WOULD ENJOY CROSSING AN ABYSS ON A WIRE CABLE SUPPOSE THE GYROSCOPE STOPPED
PECULIARLY CURVED WING CASES IF ONE MAY BORROW A FIGURE FROM THE FLYING BEETLES REMAINED EXPANDED STIFFLY
THEN HE RETIRED HE SAT BY THE FIRESIDE A SHRIVELLED VERY VERY OLD COACHMAN FULL CHARGED WITH REMINISCENCES AND READY FOR ANY CARELESS STRANGER HE COULD TELL YOU OF THE VANISHED ESTATE OF SIR PETER BONE LONG SINCE CUT UP FOR BUILDING
WE SHALL BE BACK IN IT ALL IN TWO DAYS TIME HE SAID AND IT'S A DEVIL OF A WAR TO GO BACK TO THAT'S THE NEWS THE WORLD'S GONE MAD OUR FLEET BEAT THE AMERICANS THE NIGHT WE GOT DISABLED THAT'S CLEAR
AND THE OTHERS GO ON AGAIN AS THOUGH SUCH THINGS WEREN'T POSSIBLE AS I WENT ON
AND PRESENTLY HE SAW KURT STANDING ALONE HANDS BEHIND HIM AND LOOKING AT ONE OF THE DISTANT WATERFALLS VERY STEADFASTLY HE WENT UP AND SALUTED SOLDIER FASHION BEG PARDON LIEUTENANT HE SAID KURT TURNED HIS FACE
FUNNY THING FIGHTING'LL BE HE SAID FLYING'S GOING TO BREAK OUT SAID THE SOLDIER WHEN IT DOES COME WHEN THE CURTAIN DOES GO UP I TELL YOU YOU'LL FIND EVERY ONE ON THE STAGE BUSY
RETURNED ABOVE THE CRYSTAL PALACE TOWERS CIRCLED ROUND THEM CHOSE A POSITION FOR DESCENT AND SANK DOWN OUT OF SIGHT BERT SIGHED DEEPLY AND TURNED TO HIS MOTOR BICYCLE AGAIN AND
INADEQUATELY REPORTED AND HIS NAME SPELT VARIOUSLY BETTERIDGE AND BETRIDGE UNTIL HIS FLIGHT INDEED HE DID NOT AND COULD NOT CONTRIVE TO EXIST IN THE PUBLIC MIND
LONG BROAD COMFORTABLE LOOKING CARS THAT WERE BRIGHTLY LIT AFTER DUSK AS THEY FLEW BY AT NIGHT TRANSIENT FLARES OF LIGHT AND A RUMBLING SOUND OF PASSAGE THEY KEPT UP A PERPETUAL SUMMER LIGHTNING
I'VE LOST HEART AND DEATH IS OVER ME DEATH IS CLOSE TO ME AND I KNOW I HAVE GOT TO END BUT THINK OF ALL THE HOPES I HAD ONLY A LITTLE TIME AGO THE SENSE OF FINE BEGINNINGS IT WAS ALL A SHAM THERE WERE NO BEGINNINGS
AS THOUGH I'D JUST FOUND IT OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVE FOUND IT OUT
THE PERPETUAL SEQUENCE OF TRIUMPH AND DISASTER AND SILENCE FLYING SLUMPED EVEN BALLOONING FELL AWAY TO SOME EXTENT
TO APPRECIATE MISTER BUTTERIDGE AT HIS PROPER VALUE HE CIRCLED THE UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS AND DROPPED TO WITHIN SHOUTING DISTANCE OF THE CROWDS IN WEST END PARK AND ON THE SLOPE OF GILMOREHILL
AND THERE WAS ALSO A HUGE EXCITEMENT CONSEQUENT UPON THE AMAZING GOLD DISCOVERIES OFF THE COAST OF ANGLESEA MADE BY A SUBMARINE PROSPECTOR MISS PATRICIA GIDDY
THERE WERE SCARCELY THIRTY PEOPLE ON THE LOOK OUT FOR HIM IN SPITE OF ALL HIS CLAMOUR WHEN ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK ONE SUMMER MORNING THE DOORS OF THE BIG SHED IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER HIS APPARATUS OPENED IT WAS NEAR THE
IT'S JUST AS THOUGH I HAD WOKE UP TO IT ALL FOR THE FIRST TIME EVERY NIGHT SINCE WE WERE AT NEW YORK I'VE DREAMT OF IT AND IT'S ALWAYS BEEN SO IT'S THE WAY OF LIFE PEOPLE ARE TORN AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE THEY CARE FOR HOMES ARE SMASHED CREATURES FULL OF LIFE

THIS LABRADOR SEEMS A QUIET PLACE HE RESUMED AT LAST
I SUPPOSE WE GOT TO CALL EM LADIES SAID MISTER TOM SMALLWAYS
ON THE SEATS OF TRAFALGAR SQUARE WERE ROUSED BY HIS BUZZ AND AWOKE TO DISCOVER HIM CIRCLING THE NELSON COLUMN AND BY THE TIME HE HAD GOT TO BIRMINGHAM WHICH PLACE HE CROSSED ABOUT HALF PAST TEN
THOUGH IT REMAINED A FAIRLY POPULAR SPORT AND CONTINUED TO LIFT GRAVEL FROM THE WHARF OF THE BUN HILL GAS WORKS AND DROP IT UPON DESERVING PEOPLE'S LAWNS AND GARDENS THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN REASSURING YEARS FOR TOM AT LEAST SO FAR AS FLYING WAS CONCERNED
HE THREW HIS MATCH ASIDE AND WALKED TO HIS MACHINE I TELL YOU SIR HE SAID THERE ISN'T A BIG POWER IN EUROPE OR ASIA OR AMERICA
BRAVE SOLDIERS LEADING ZIONISTS DESERVING NOVELISTS NOBLE LADIES CONGESTED THE NARROW PASSAGE AND THRUST DISTINGUISHED ELBOWS INTO RIBS THE WORLD WOULD NOT WILLINGLY LET BREAK DEEMING THEMSELVES FORTUNATE
WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME THE NEWS DAMN THE NEWS SAID KURT YOU'LL GET NEWS ENOUGH BEFORE THE DAY'S OUT IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD THEY'RE SENDING THE GRAF ZEPPELIN FOR US SHE'LL BE HERE BY THE MORNING AND WE OUGHT TO BE AT NIAGARA OR ETERNAL SMASH WITHIN EIGHT
I KNOW HE REPEATED AND FOR A TIME THEY WALKED IN SILENCE TOWARDS THE WATERFALL KURT WRAPPED IN HIS THOUGHTS WALKED HEEDLESSLY AND AT LAST BROKE OUT AGAIN I'VE ALWAYS FELT YOUNG BEFORE SMALLWAYS BUT THIS MORNING I FEEL OLD
AND THEN YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T COME THERE WAS A HITCH THEY FLEW THAT WAS ALL RIGHT THEY FLEW IN MACHINES HEAVIER THAN AIR BUT THEY SMASHED SOMETIMES THEY SMASHED THE ENGINE SOMETIMES THEY SMASHED THE AERONAUT USUALLY THEY SMASHED BOTH
THEN IT WAS DRIVEN HOME TO THEIR MINDS BY THE CINEMATOGRAPH THEN BERT'S IMAGINATION WAS STIMULATED BY A SIXPENNY EDITION OF THAT AERONAUTIC CLASSIC MISTER GEORGE GRIFFITH'S CLIPPER OF THE CLOUDS AND SO THE THING REALLY GOT HOLD OF THEM
THE EDDIES NEAR THE GROUND UPSET THEM A PASSING THOUGHT IN THE MIND OF THE AERONAUT UPSET THEM ALSO THEY UPSET SIMPLY IT'S THIS STABILITY DOES EM SAID GRUBB REPEATING HIS NEWSPAPER
HER DEAFENING BLAST WAS ECHOING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THE DESPAIRED OF THING WAS DONE A MAN WAS FLYING SECURELY AND WELL SCOTLAND WAS AGAPE FOR HIS COMING
YOU'LL SEE ER AGAIN ALL RIGHT SAID BERT NO I SHALL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE SHOULD MEET JUST TO BE TORN APART BUT I KNOW SHE AND I WILL NEVER MEET AGAIN
THEY HAF BURN HAMBURG AND PARIS CHAPAN HASS BURN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAF MATE A CAMP AT NIAGARA DAT IS WHAD THEY ARE TELLING US
IT WENT OVERHEAD PERHAPS A THOUSAND FEET UP BERT HEARD THE ENGINE SAILED AWAY SOUTHWARD VANISHED OVER THE HILLS REAPPEARED A LITTLE BLUE OUTLINE FAR OFF IN THE EAST GOING NOW VERY FAST BEFORE A GENTLE SOUTH WEST GALE
THERE IS NO PLACE WHERE A WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER CAN HIDE AND BE AT PEACE THE WAR COMES THROUGH THE AIR BOMBS DROP IN THE NIGHT QUIET PEOPLE GO OUT IN THE MORNING AND SEE AIR FLEETS PASSING OVERHEAD DRIPPING DEATH
COULD BE SEEN SITTING ASTRIDE MUCH AS A MAN BESTRIDES A HORSE THE WASP LIKE RESEMBLANCE WAS INCREASED BY THE FACT THAT THE APPARATUS FLEW WITH A DEEP BOOMING HUM EXACTLY THE SOUND MADE BY A WASP AT A WINDOWPANE
THE CONVERSATION SEEMED DEGENERATING INTO AN AMIABLE WRANGLE OF CONTRADICTION I TELL YOU THEY ARE FLYING THE SOLDIER INSISTED I SEE IT MYSELF
THEY'RE FIGHTING IN THE AIR ALL OVER EUROPE ALL OVER THE WORLD THE JAPANESE AND CHINESE HAVE JOINED IN THAT'S THE GREAT FACT THAT'S THE SUPREME FACT THEY'VE POUNCED INTO OUR LITTLE QUARRELS THE YELLOW PERIL WAS A PERIL AFTER ALL THEY'VE GOT THOUSANDS OF AIRSHIPS
CHAPS ABOUT THE CAMP NOW AND THEN WE GET A PEEP IT ISN'T ONLY US NEITHER THERE'S THE JAPANESE YOU BET THEY GOT IT TOO AND THE GERMANS THE SOLDIER STOOD WITH HIS LEGS VERY WIDE APART AND FILLED HIS PIPE THOUGHTFULLY
WHICH WAS STILL NOT BUILT UPON AND UNCHANGED EXCEPT FOR A COUPLE OF ADVERTISEMENT BOARDS ONE RECOMMENDING A TWO AND SIXPENNY WATCH AND ONE A NERVE RESTORER THESE BY THE BYE WERE PLACED ALMOST HORIZONTALLY TO CATCH THE EYE OF THE PASSING MONO RAIL PASSENGERS ABOVE
AS AN IDYLLIC KENTISH VILLAGE HE HAD DRIVEN SIR PETER BONE UNTIL HE WAS FIFTY AND THEN HE TOOK TO DRINK A LITTLE AND DRIVING THE STATION BUS
AND AN IMPLACABLE MANNER HE HAD BEEN AN UNDISTINGUISHED MEMBER OF MOST OF THE EXISTING AERONAUTICAL ASSOCIATIONS THEN ONE DAY HE WROTE TO ALL THE LONDON PAPERS TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE HAD MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR AN ASCENT FROM THE CRYSTAL PALACE
MOREOVER EVERY TRADESMAN IN THE PLACE AND INDEED NEARLY EVERY HOUSE HAD ITS OWN TELEPHONE THE MONO RAIL CABLE STANDARD BECAME A STRIKING FACT IN URBAN LANDSCAPE FOR THE MOST PART STOUT IRON ERECTIONS RATHER LIKE TAPERING TRESTLES
AND IN THOSE DAYS IF EVER ONE HEARD A MAN SAYING IN A PUBLIC PLACE IN A LOUD REASSURING CONFIDENT TONE IT'S BOUND TO COME THE CHANCES WERE TEN TO ONE HE WAS TALKING OF FLYING AND BERT GOT A BOX LID AND WROTE OUT IN CORRECT WINDOW TICKET STYLE
OR FOR THE MATTER OF THAT AN UNACCREDITED NATIVE CAN'T GET WITHIN FOUR MILES OF LYDD NOWADAYS NOT TO MENTION OUR LITTLE CIRCUS AT ALDERSHOT AND THE EXPERIMENTAL CAMP IN GALWAY NO
AND MUSING PROFOUNDLY KURT LED THE WAY ACROSS THE ROCKS TOWARDS THE DISTANT WATERFALL FOR A TIME BERT WALKED BEHIND HIM IN THE CHARACTER OF AN ESCORT THEN AS THEY PASSED OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE ENCAMPMENT KURT LAGGED FOR HIM TO COME ALONGSIDE
THE SOLDIER PREPARED TO LIGHT HIS PIPE LOOKS LIKE A SECRET SOCIETY GOT HOLD OF THEM SAID BERT
THEY TALK AND THEY DO SAID THE SOLDIER THE THING'S COMING IT KEEPS ON COMING SAID BERT I SHALL BELIEVE WHEN I SEE IT THAT WON'T BE LONG SAID THE SOLDIER
GAW HE SAID AND STOOPED TO PICK ONE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS
HE SAID NOTHING FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN HE DROPPED OUT THE PRINCE IS A LUNATIC THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD TO CLIMB AND THEN TO A LONG PEAT LEVEL BESIDE A RIVULET THERE A QUANTITY OF DELICATE LITTLE PINK FLOWERS CAUGHT BERT'S EYE
I'M GOING TO BE KILLED I DIDN'T KNOW IT BEFORE BUT THIS MORNING AT DAWN I KNEW IT AS THOUGH I'D BEEN TOLD OW I TELL YOU I KNOW BUT OW COULD YOU KNOW I KNOW LIKE BEING TOLD LIKE BEING CERTAIN
AND PAINTED A BRIGHT BLUISH GREEN ONE IT HAPPENED BESTRODE TOM'S HOUSE WHICH LOOKED STILL MORE RETIRING AND APOLOGETIC BENEATH ITS IMMENSITY AND ANOTHER GIANT STOOD JUST INSIDE THE CORNER OF HIS GARDEN
MISTER BUTTERIDGE TOOK THE WORLD BY SURPRISE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE GENTLEMEN FROM NOWHERE FATE STILL SUCCEEDS IN PRODUCING FOR THE STIMULATION OF MANKIND HE CAME IT WAS VARIOUSLY SAID FROM AUSTRALIA
THERE FOLLOWED ACTUAL FLIGHT THIS HOWEVER WAS NOT AN AFFAIR THAT WAS VISIBLE FROM BUN HILL IT WAS SOMETHING THAT OCCURRED IN PRIVATE GROUNDS OR OTHER ENCLOSED PLACES
WHEN I WAS IS AGE I'D NEVER BEEN TO LONDON NEVER BIN SOUTH OF CRAWLEY
HIS UNWILLING MIND THE FACT THAT THE GODDESS OF CHANGE WAS TURNING HER DISTURBING ATTENTION TO THE SKY THE FIRST GREAT BOOM IN AERONAUTICS WAS BEGINNING GRUBB AND BERT HEARD OF IT IN A MUSIC HALL
THEY DISAPPEAR GONE NO ADDRESS FIRST OH IT'S AN OLD STORY NOW THERE WAS THOSE WRIGHT BROTHERS OUT IN AMERICA THEY GLIDED THEY GLIDED MILES AND MILES FINALLY THEY GLIDED OFF STAGE
BERT IT IS NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN WAS A PROGRESSIVE SMALLWAYS NOTHING SPEAKS MORE ELOQUENTLY OF THE PITILESS INSISTENCE OF PROGRESS AND EXPANSION IN OUR TIME THAN THAT IT SHOULD GET INTO THE SMALLWAYS BLOOD
GOT ON TO IT WITH THE ADVICE AND ASSISTANCE OF GRUBB AND
THE JAPANESE AT PORT ARTHUR THE FRENCH AT CASABLANCA IS GOING ON EVERYWHERE EVERYWHERE DOWN IN SOUTH AMERICA EVEN THEY ARE FIGHTING AMONG THEMSELVES NO PLACE IS SAFE NO PLACE IS AT PEACE
GRAPE FRUITS MANGOES THE MOTOR CARS THAT WENT BY NORTHWARD AND SOUTHWARD GREW MORE AND MORE POWERFUL AND EFFICIENT WHIZZED FASTER AND SMELT WORSE
AND A WONDERFUL CAP A STINK MAKING GENTLEMAN A SWIFT HIGH CLASS BADGER WHO FLED PERPETUALLY ALONG HIGH ROADS FROM THE DUST AND STINK HE PERPETUALLY MADE AND HIS LADY AS THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE HER AT BUN HILL
THE COMING OF FLYING OCCURRED PEOPLE TALK GLIBLY ENOUGH OF EPOCH MAKING EVENTS THIS WAS AN EPOCH MAKING EVENT IT WAS THE UNANTICIPATED AND ENTIRELY SUCCESSFUL FLIGHT
TO ADD HIMSELF AS ONE MORE VOLUNTARY PUBLIC DANGER TO THE AMENITIES OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
AND MEMORIES AND LITTLE PECULIAR GIFTS ARE SCALDED AND SMASHED AND TORN TO PIECES AND STARVED AND SPOILT
WHICH FOR SOME REASON UPSET TOM DREADFULLY AND MADE HIM GLOOMY FOR DAYS AFTER THE FIRST ONE PASSED THE SHOP ALL THIS GYROSCOPIC AND MONO RAIL DEVELOPMENT NATURALLY ABSORBED A VAST AMOUNT OF PUBLIC ATTENTION
OF MISTER ALFRED BUTTERIDGE FROM THE CRYSTAL PALACE TO GLASGOW AND BACK IN A SMALL BUSINESSLIKE LOOKING MACHINE HEAVIER THAN AIR AN ENTIRELY MANAGEABLE AND CONTROLLABLE MACHINE THAT COULD FLY AS WELL AS A PIGEON
IT WAS NOW NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OLD ITS POINTS DISCUSSED THE SOLDIER BROKE INTO A NEW TOPIC WITH MY NEXT'S GOING TO BE AN AEROPLANE SO FAR AS I CAN SEE I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF ROADS AND WAYS THEY TORK SAID BERT
UNFORTUNATELY HEAVEN HAD NOT PLANNED A PEACEFUL WORLD FOR HIM HE LIVED IN A WORLD OF OBSTINATE AND INCESSANT CHANGE AND IN PARTS WHERE ITS OPERATIONS WERE UNSPARINGLY CONSPICUOUS VICISSITUDE WAS IN THE VERY SOIL HE TILLED
AND ALL THE SPORTING ONES APPROVED OF IT AS BEING VERY GOOD INDEED EVERYBODY TALKED OF FLYING EVERYBODY REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN BOUND TO COME
WITH A BLACK SMEARED FACE BY DAY AND A MUSIC HALL SIDE IN THE EVENING WHO DREAMT OF A PATENT LEVER CHAIN AND IT SEEMED TO BERT THAT HE WAS THE PERFECT MODEL OF A GENTLEMAN OF SPIRIT
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ADVANCED AND ENTERPRISING ABOUT YOUNG SMALLWAYS BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF SHORT FROCKS HE WAS LOST FOR A WHOLE DAY BEFORE HE WAS FIVE
WHAT THEY DROPPED AS BALLASE
SUCH FIGHTING TOO I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T READ THE PAPERS ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING I READ EM A BIT SAID BERT
EXCEPT NEAR THE MIDDLE WHERE THEY ROSE HIGHER TO ALLOW THE PASSAGE OF THE LONDON AND ANTWERP SHIPPING AND THE HAMBURG AMERICA LINERS THEN HEAVY MOTOR CARS BEGAN TO RUN ABOUT ON ONLY A COUPLE OF WHEELS ONE BEHIND THE OTHER
HE COULD RIDE BICYCLES FOR MILES THAT WOULD HAVE COME TO PIECES INSTANTLY UNDER YOU OR ME
BERT GOT A CYCLIST'S SUIT CAP BADGE AND ALL AND TO SEE HIM AND GRUBB GOING DOWN TO BRIGHTON AND BACK HEADS DOWN HANDLE BARS DOWN BACKBONES CURVED WAS A REVELATION IN THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE SMALLWAYS BLOOD
THE FRAMEWORK HAD AN AIR OF DRAGGING THE RELUCTANT GAS CYLINDER AFTER IT LIKE A BRISK LITTLE TERRIER TOWING A SHY GAS DISTENDED ELEPHANT INTO SOCIETY THE COMBINED MONSTER CERTAINLY TRAVELLED AND STEERED
OLD SO OLD NEARER TO DEATH THAN OLD MEN FEEL AND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT LIFE WAS A LARK IT ISN'T THIS SORT OF THING HAS ALWAYS BEEN HAPPENING I SUPPOSE THESE THINGS WARS AND EARTHQUAKES THAT SWEEP ACROSS ALL THE DECENCY OF LIFE
HE DID HIS BEST TO CONSOLE HIMSELF TO IMAGINE MATTERS NEAR THE TURN OF THE TIDE YOU'D HARDLY THINK IT COULD KEEP ON HE SAID MISTER SMALLWAYS AGED FATHER COULD REMEMBER BUN HILL
IT ISN'T VERY LIKE BUT IT'S LIKE ENOUGH LIKE WHAT ANOTHER WATERFALL I KNEW HE ASKED A QUESTION ABRUPTLY GOT A GIRL SMALLWAYS FUNNY THING SAID BERT THOSE FLOWERS I SUPPOSE I WAS JES THINKING OF ER
SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE REEFS CROPPING UP AGAIN UNDER THE WATER SHE HAD SET HERSELF TO VERIFY THIS SUPPOSITION BY THE USE OF THE SUBMARINE CRAWLER INVENTED BY DOCTOR ALBERTO CASSINI
WAS A WEATHER BITTEN GODDESS AS FREE FROM REFINEMENT AS A GIPSY
GO AHEAD TIMES OLD SMALLWAYS WOULD SIT OVER THE FIRE MUMBLING OF THE GREATNESS OF OTHER DAYS OF OLD SIR PETER WHO DROVE HIS COACH TO BRIGHTON AND BACK IN EIGHT AND TWENTY HOURS
REGARDLESS OF THE NEW DIRECTION IN WHICH THE STRIVING SOUL OF MAN WAS FINDING EXERCISE AND REFRESHMENT HE FAILED TO OBSERVE THAT THE TYPE OF MOTOR CAR LIKE THE TYPE OF BICYCLE WAS SETTLING DOWN AND LOSING ITS ADVENTUROUS QUALITY
THE INVENTOR WHO TURNS UP IN A BLAZE OF PUBLICITY FIRES OFF A FEW SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENTS AND VANISHES
AND SPENT HIS SURPLUS MONEY UPON REMARKABLE TIES AND COLLARS CIGARETTES AND SHORTHAND CLASSES AT THE BUN HILL INSTITUTE
THE THING FLEW QUITE STEADILY AT A PACE OF ABOUT THREE MILES AN HOUR IN A WIDE CIRCLE MAKING A DEEP HUM
AT FIRST THE MOST OBVIOUS ASPECT WAS THE MULTIPLICATION OF BALLOONS THE SKY OF BUN HILL BEGAN TO BE INFESTED BY BALLOONS ON WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY AFTERNOONS PARTICULARLY YOU COULD SCARCELY LOOK SKYWARD FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR WITHOUT DISCOVERING A BALLOON SOMEWHERE
WELL SAID BERT I'D LIKE TO SEE ONE OF THEM ANYHOW JEST TO HELP BELIEVING I'LL BELIEVE WHEN I SEE THAT I'LL PROMISE YOU
BERT MET IT ONE EARLY CLOSING AFTERNOON AS HE REFRESHED HIMSELF IN AN INN NEAR NUTFIELD WHITHER HIS MOTOR BICYCLE HAD BROUGHT HIM THERE SMOKED AND MEDITATED A PERSON IN KHAKI
CYLINDERS CONES PEAR SHAPED MONSTERS EVEN AT LAST A THING OF ALUMINIUM THAT GLITTERED WONDERFULLY AND THAT GRUBB THROUGH SOME CONFUSION OF IDEAS ABOUT ARMOUR PLATES WAS INCLINED TO CONSIDER A WAR MACHINE
OF GREAT POSSESSIONS EASILY WON AND LOST OF CHANCE UNDER ALL ITS FORMS HAUNT THE MIND THE INSTABILITY OF SOCIETY ITSELF FOSTERS THE NATURAL INSTABILITY OF MAN'S DESIRES
AND SEVERS EVERY LINK OF IT AS SOCIAL CONDITIONS BECOME MORE EQUAL THE NUMBER OF PERSONS INCREASES WHO ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NEITHER RICH ENOUGH NOR POWERFUL ENOUGH TO EXERCISE ANY GREAT INFLUENCE OVER THEIR FELLOW CREATURES
AMONGST A NATION WHERE ARISTOCRACY PREDOMINATES IN SOCIETY AND KEEPS IT STATIONARY THE PEOPLE IN THE END GET AS MUCH ACCUSTOMED TO POVERTY AS THE RICH TO THEIR OPULENCE
AS NONE IS DIFFERENT FROM HIS FELLOWS NONE CAN EXERCISE A TYRANNICAL POWER MEN WILL BE PERFECTLY FREE BECAUSE THEY WILL ALL BE ENTIRELY EQUAL AND THEY WILL ALL BE PERFECTLY EQUAL
MAY ULTIMATELY BE ESTABLISHED IN THE WORLD WHICH WOULD NOT CORRUPT BUT
BUT THIS SAME DESIRE LEADS ALL MEN IN THE LONG RUN MUTUALLY TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER AND IF IT HAPPENS THAT AN ELECTION ACCIDENTALLY SEVERS TWO FRIENDS
IN ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRIES THERE ARE FEW PUBLIC OFFICERS WHO DO NOT AFFECT TO SERVE THEIR COUNTRY WITHOUT INTERESTED MOTIVES THEIR SALARY IS AN INCIDENT OF WHICH THEY THINK BUT LITTLE
HAVE NEVERTHELESS ACQUIRED OR RETAINED SUFFICIENT EDUCATION AND FORTUNE TO SATISFY THEIR OWN WANTS THEY OWE NOTHING TO ANY MAN
AND SO FATAL THEY ALSO THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE WELL TO INFUSE POLITICAL LIFE INTO EACH PORTION OF THE TERRITORY IN ORDER TO MULTIPLY TO AN INFINITE EXTENT
I MAY HERE BE MET BY AN OBJECTION DERIVED FROM ELECTIONEERING INTRIGUES THE MEANNESSES OF CANDIDATES AND THE CALUMNIES OF THEIR OPPONENTS
THEY REQUIRE SUMPTUOUS DEPRAVITY AND SPLENDID CORRUPTION THE WORSHIP THEY PAY THE SENSES IS A GORGEOUS ONE AND THEY SEEM TO VIE WITH EACH OTHER IN THE ART OF DEGRADING THEIR OWN NATURES
WHEN THESE SAME MEN ENGAGE IN THE AFFAIRS OF THIS WORLD THE SAME HABITS MAY BE TRACED IN THEIR CONDUCT THEY ARE APT TO SET UP SOME GENERAL AND CERTAIN AIM AND END TO THEIR ACTIONS HERE BELOW
MANY SCANTY FORTUNES SPRING UP THOSE WHO POSSESS THEM HAVE A SUFFICIENT SHARE OF PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS TO CONCEIVE A TASTE FOR THESE PLEASURES NOT ENOUGH TO SATISFY IT
AND AT THE MOMENT AT WHICH THEY BECOME MOST VIOLENT HABIT ALREADY CAUSES THEM TO BE NO LONGER FELT THE ADVANTAGES WHICH FREEDOM BRINGS ARE ONLY SHOWN BY LENGTH OF TIME
EQUALITY WAS THEREFORE A FACT OF SOME STANDING WHEN FREEDOM WAS STILL A NOVELTY THE ONE HAD ALREADY CREATED CUSTOMS OPINIONS AND LAWS BELONGING TO IT
A SUBLIME EXPRESSION MAN SEARCHING BY HIS INTELLECT INTO THE DIVINE CONCEPTION AND SEEING THAT ORDER IS THE PURPOSE OF GOD FREELY COMBINES TO PROSECUTE THE GREAT DESIGN
FROM TIME TO TIME STRANGE SECTS ARISE WHICH ENDEAVOR TO STRIKE OUT EXTRAORDINARY PATHS TO ETERNAL HAPPINESS RELIGIOUS INSANITY IS VERY COMMON IN THE UNITED STATES NOR OUGHT THESE FACTS TO SURPRISE US
THE LATTER MAKES GENERAL INDIFFERENCE A SORT OF PUBLIC VIRTUE DESPOTISM THEN WHICH IS AT ALL TIMES DANGEROUS IS MORE PARTICULARLY TO BE FEARED IN DEMOCRATIC AGES
HE WILLINGLY IMPOSES DUTIES ON HIMSELF TOWARDS THE FORMER AND THE LATTER AND HE WILL FREQUENTLY SACRIFICE HIS PERSONAL GRATIFICATIONS TO THOSE WHO WENT BEFORE AND TO THOSE WHO WILL COME AFTER HIM
OF THE TASTE FOR PHYSICAL WELL BEING IN AMERICA IN AMERICA THE PASSION FOR PHYSICAL WELL BEING IS NOT ALWAYS EXCLUSIVE BUT IT IS GENERAL AND IF ALL DO NOT FEEL IT IN THE SAME MANNER
ASK NOT WHAT SINGULAR CHARM THE MEN OF DEMOCRATIC AGES FIND IN BEING EQUAL OR WHAT SPECIAL REASONS THEY MAY HAVE FOR CLINGING SO TENACIOUSLY TO EQUALITY RATHER THAN TO THE OTHER ADVANTAGES WHICH SOCIETY HOLDS OUT TO THEM
THAT AMONGST THE AMERICANS ALL HONEST CALLINGS ARE HONORABLE AMONGST A DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE WHERE THERE IS NO HEREDITARY WEALTH
WHEN RICHES ARE HEREDITARILY FIXED IN FAMILIES THERE ARE A GREAT NUMBER OF MEN WHO ENJOY THE COMFORTS OF LIFE WITHOUT FEELING AN EXCLUSIVE TASTE FOR THOSE COMFORTS
EVEN THOSE WHO ARE PRINCIPALLY ACTUATED BY THE LOVE OF FAME ARE NECESSARILY MADE FAMILIAR WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THEY ARE NOT EXCLUSIVELY ACTUATED BY THAT MOTIVE AND THEY DISCOVER THAT THE DESIRE OF GETTING A LIVING
WHEREAS MEN WHO HAVE TOILED TO ACQUIRE A COMPETENCY CAN HARDLY LIVE AFTER THEY HAVE LOST IT IF I TURN MY OBSERVATION FROM THE UPPER TO THE LOWER CLASSES I FIND ANALOGOUS EFFECTS PRODUCED BY OPPOSITE CAUSES
CONFERS A NUMBER OF SMALL ENJOYMENTS ON EVERY MAN
I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT INTEREST IS THE SOLE MOTIVE OF RELIGIOUS MEN BUT I BELIEVE THAT INTEREST IS THE PRINCIPAL MEANS WHICH RELIGIONS THEMSELVES EMPLOY TO GOVERN MEN AND I DO NOT QUESTION
WHAT IS LIKELY TO BEFALL IN THE WORLD AND TO FEED UPON HOPES THEY CAN HARDLY CONFINE THEIR MINDS WITHIN THE PRECISE CIRCUMFERENCE OF LIFE AND THEY ARE READY TO BREAK THE BOUNDARY AND CAST THEIR LOOKS BEYOND I DO NOT DOUBT
THAN FOR THEIR EXTRAORDINARY ENJOYMENTS THEY GRATIFY A NUMBER OF PETTY DESIRES WITHOUT INDULGING IN ANY GREAT IRREGULARITIES OF PASSION THUS THEY ARE MORE APT TO BECOME
AMONGST DEMOCRATIC NATIONS NEW FAMILIES ARE CONSTANTLY SPRINGING UP OTHERS ARE CONSTANTLY FALLING AWAY
WHEN MEN HAVE ONCE ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO THINK NO MORE OF WHAT IS TO BEFALL THEM AFTER LIFE THEY READILY LAPSE INTO THAT COMPLETE AND BRUTAL INDIFFERENCE TO FUTURITY WHICH IS BUT TOO CONFORMABLE TO SOME PROPENSITIES OF MANKIND
IS TO BE ALWAYS STRIVING TO PLACE THE OBJECTS OF HUMAN ACTIONS FAR BEYOND MAN'S IMMEDIATE RANGE CIRCUMSCRIBED BY THE CHARACTER OF HIS COUNTRY AND HIS AGE
ABSOLUTE KINGS WERE THE MOST EFFICIENT LEVELLERS OF RANKS AMONGST THEIR SUBJECTS AMONGST THESE NATIONS EQUALITY PRECEDED FREEDOM
AND I HAVE REMARKED A HUNDRED INSTANCES IN WHICH THEY HARDLY EVER FAILED TO LEND FAITHFUL SUPPORT TO EACH OTHER THE FREE INSTITUTIONS WHICH THE INHABITANTS OF THE UNITED STATES POSSESS
NOT BUT THAT IN THE UNITED STATES AS ELSEWHERE THERE ARE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF WEALTHY PERSONS WHO HAVING COME INTO THEIR PROPERTY BY INHERITANCE POSSESS WITHOUT EXERTION
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ALSO WORKS FOR PAY HE IS PAID FOR COMMANDING OTHER MEN FOR OBEYING ORDERS
BUT AS I DO NOT FIND THAT THE CAUSES OF THE FACT HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY ANALYZED I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO POINT THEM OUT
THAT THIS WAY THEY STRIKE INTO THE MULTITUDE AND BECOME POPULAR IT IS NOT EASY CLEARLY TO PERCEIVE WHY THE PRINCIPLE OF INTEREST RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD SHOULD KEEP ALOOF FROM RELIGIOUS OPINIONS
IN THE MIDDLE AGES THE CLERGY SPOKE OF NOTHING BUT A FUTURE STATE THEY HARDLY CARED TO PROVE THAT A SINCERE CHRISTIAN MAY BE A HAPPY MAN HERE BELOW BUT THE AMERICAN PREACHERS ARE CONSTANTLY REFERRING
DISSOLUTE ARISTOCRACIES MOST OF THESE WEALTHY PERSONS WERE ONCE POOR THEY HAVE FELT THE STING OF WANT THEY WERE LONG A PREY TO ADVERSE FORTUNES AND NOW THAT THE VICTORY IS WON
THE PERIOD WHEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY UPON THE RUINS OF AN ARISTOCRACY HAS JUST BEEN COMPLETED IS ESPECIALLY THAT AT WHICH THIS SEPARATION OF MEN FROM ONE ANOTHER
YET IT IS FELT BY ALL CAREFULLY TO SATISFY ALL EVEN THE LEAST WANTS OF THE BODY AND TO PROVIDE THE LITTLE CONVENIENCES OF LIFE IS UPPERMOST IN EVERY MIND
NO PROFESSION EXISTS IN WHICH MEN DO NOT WORK FOR MONEY AND THE REMUNERATION WHICH IS COMMON TO THEM ALL GIVES THEM ALL AN AIR OF RESEMBLANCE
FREEDOM HAS APPEARED IN THE WORLD AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND UNDER VARIOUS FORMS IT HAS NOT BEEN EXCLUSIVELY BOUND TO ANY SOCIAL CONDITION AND IT IS NOT CONFINED TO DEMOCRACIES
AND THAT IN DEMOCRATIC AGES YOU ATTACH A POOR MAN TO YOU MORE BY YOUR MANNER THAN BY BENEFITS CONFERRED THE MAGNITUDE OF SUCH BENEFITS WHICH SETS OFF THE DIFFERENCE OF CONDITIONS
BUT THEY FEEL IMPRISONED WITHIN BOUNDS WHICH THEY WILL APPARENTLY NEVER BE ALLOWED TO PASS
IN THOSE COUNTRIES IN WHICH UNHAPPILY IRRELIGION AND DEMOCRACY COEXIST THE MOST IMPORTANT DUTY OF PHILOSOPHERS AND OF THOSE IN POWER
IF HE SHOULD HAVE CONCEIVED ANY DOUBTS AS TO THE OBJECT OF HIS HOPES STILL HE WILL NOT EASILY ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE STOPPED BY THEM AND HE WILL DECIDE THAT IT IS WISE TO RISK SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS WORLD
THE PROPOSITION IN POINT OF PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS THE MOST OPULENT MEMBERS OF A DEMOCRACY WILL NOT DISPLAY TASTES VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE PEOPLE WHETHER IT BE THAT SPRINGING FROM THE PEOPLE THEY REALLY SHARE THOSE TASTES
THE INTEREST OF MAN IS CONFINED TO THOSE IN CLOSE PROPINQUITY TO HIMSELF AS EACH CLASS APPROXIMATES TO OTHER CLASSES AND INTERMINGLES WITH THEM
MOMENTARY OUTBREAKS OCCUR WHEN THEIR SOULS SEEM SUDDENLY TO BURST THE BONDS OF MATTER BY WHICH THEY ARE RESTRAINED AND TO SOAR IMPETUOUSLY TOWARDS HEAVEN
AND THE POLITICAL RIGHTS OF WHICH THEY MAKE SO MUCH USE REMIND EVERY CITIZEN AND IN A THOUSAND WAYS THAT HE LIVES IN SOCIETY
AND EVEN THEIR WANT OF POLISH IS NOT ALWAYS DISPLEASING THIS TRUTH DOES NOT TAKE ROOT AT ONCE IN THE MINDS OF THE RICH THEY GENERALLY RESIST IT AS LONG AS THE DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTION LASTS
BUT DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONS LEAD THEM TO SHUN EACH OTHER AND PERPETUATE IN A STATE OF EQUALITY THE ANIMOSITIES WHICH THE STATE OF INEQUALITY ENGENDERED THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF THE AMERICANS
CAUSES OF FANATICAL ENTHUSIASM IN SOME AMERICANS ALTHOUGH THE DESIRE OF ACQUIRING THE GOOD THINGS OF THIS WORLD IS THE PREVAILING PASSION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CERTAIN
BUT THEY ARE MISTAKEN THEY MIGHT SPEND FORTUNES THUS WITHOUT WARMING THE HEARTS OF THE POPULATION AROUND THEM THAT POPULATION DOES NOT ASK THEM FOR THE SACRIFICE OF THEIR MONEY BUT OF THEIR PRIDE
BECAUSE THEY WILL BE ENTIRELY FREE TO THIS IDEAL STATE DEMOCRATIC NATIONS TEND
OPPORTUNITIES OF ACTING IN CONCERT FOR ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO MAKE THEM CONSTANTLY FEEL THEIR MUTUAL DEPENDENCE ON EACH OTHER THE PLAN WAS A WISE ONE
BUT NOTHING IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN SIMILAR INSTANCES OF FAVOR EXHIBITED TO THE EYES OF A DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE THEY GIVE THE LAST IMPULSE TO THE PUBLIC MIND IN A DIRECTION WHERE EVERYTHING HURRIES IT ONWARDS
IF SUCH A MAN BELIEVES IN THE RELIGION WHICH HE PROFESSES IT WILL COST HIM BUT LITTLE TO SUBMIT TO THE RESTRICTIONS IT MAY IMPOSE REASON HERSELF COUNSELS HIM TO OBEY AND HABIT HAS PREPARED HIM TO ENDURE THEM
AND THAT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THEIR SUPPORT HE MUST OFTEN LEND THEM HIS CO OPERATION WHEN THE PUBLIC IS SUPREME
A WEALTHY MAN THINKS THAT HE OWES IT TO PUBLIC OPINION TO DEVOTE HIS LEISURE TO SOME KIND OF INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL PURSUIT OR TO PUBLIC BUSINESS HE WOULD THINK HIMSELF IN BAD REPUTE IF HE EMPLOYED HIS LIFE
CHRISTIANITY INDEED TEACHES THAT A MAN MUST PREFER HIS NEIGHBOR TO HIMSELF IN ORDER TO GAIN ETERNAL LIFE BUT CHRISTIANITY ALSO TEACHES THAT MEN OUGHT TO BENEFIT THEIR FELLOW CREATURES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
A MAN COMBATS HIS INSTINCT ON ALL OCCASIONS AND DELIBERATELY CALCULATES EVERY ACTION OF HIS LIFE THAT INSTEAD OF YIELDING BLINDLY TO THE
CAN ONLY BE SECURED BY RENOUNCING A THOUSAND TRANSIENT GRATIFICATIONS AND THAT A MAN MUST PERPETUALLY TRIUMPH OVER HIMSELF IN ORDER TO SECURE HIS OWN ADVANTAGE THE FOUNDERS OF ALMOST ALL RELIGIONS
BUT THERE ARE A THOUSAND OTHERS WHICH WITHOUT BEING EQUALLY PERFECT ARE NOT LESS CHERISHED BY THOSE NATIONS THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY MAY BE ESTABLISHED IN CIVIL SOCIETY WITHOUT PREVAILING IN THE POLITICAL WORLD
WHEN AN IMMENSE FIELD FOR COMPETITION IS THROWN OPEN TO ALL WHEN WEALTH IS AMASSED OR DISSIPATED IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE SPACE OF TIME AMIDST THE TURMOIL OF DEMOCRACY VISIONS OF SUDDEN AND EASY FORTUNES
ONLY SAPS THE VIRTUES OF PUBLIC LIFE BUT IN THE LONG RUN IT ATTACKS AND DESTROYS ALL OTHERS AND IS AT LENGTH ABSORBED IN DOWNRIGHT EGOTISM
THEY RISK THEIR DEAREST INTERESTS THEY ARE DEAF SHOW THEM NOT FREEDOM ESCAPING FROM THEIR GRASP WHILST THEY ARE LOOKING ANOTHER WAY THEY ARE BLIND OR RATHER
THAN TO FELICITY HEREAFTER AND THIS IS ONE OF THEIR CHIEF POLITICAL CHARACTERISTICS BUT IN PROPORTION AS THE LIGHT OF FAITH GROWS DIM THE RANGE OF MAN'S SIGHT IS CIRCUMSCRIBED
AND WHILST HE SACRIFICES HIS PERSONAL INTERESTS TO THIS CONSUMMATE ORDER OF ALL CREATED THINGS EXPECTS NO OTHER RECOMPENSE THAN THE PLEASURE OF CONTEMPLATING IT
THEY COMMONLY CONCENTRATE IN THAT DIRECTION ALL THE ENERGY WHICH THEY DERIVE FROM THEIR LONG EXPERIENCE OF POWER SUCH MEN ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE PURSUIT OF COMFORT
THE TASK OF THOSE IN POWER IS NOT LESS CLEARLY MARKED OUT AT ALL TIMES IT IS IMPORTANT
ENJOYED BUT SCARCELY THOUGHT OF AS THE NATURAL AND INSTINCTIVE TASTE WHICH ALL MEN FEEL FOR BEING WELL OFF IS THUS SATISFIED WITHOUT TROUBLE AND WITHOUT APPREHENSION THEIR FACULTIES ARE TURNED ELSEWHERE
THE ADVANTAGES OF EQUALITY ARE INSTANTANEOUS
AND THE EGOTISM RESULTING FROM IT MOST FORCIBLY STRIKE THE OBSERVATION DEMOCRATIC COMMUNITIES NOT ONLY CONTAIN A LARGE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT CITIZENS BUT THEY ARE CONSTANTLY FILLED WITH MEN WHO
APPROPRIATE TO THEIR CONDITION THAN THIS LOVE OF PHYSICAL PROSPERITY THE PASSION FOR PHYSICAL COMFORTS IS ESSENTIALLY A PASSION OF THE MIDDLE CLASSES WITH THOSE CLASSES IT GROWS AND SPREADS
THAN THEY ARE DISPOSED TO ACT AS IF THEY WERE TO EXIST BUT FOR A SINGLE DAY IN SCEPTICAL AGES IT IS ALWAYS THEREFORE TO BE FEARED THAT MEN MAY PERPETUALLY GIVE WAY TO THEIR DAILY CASUAL DESIRES
THE SOUL HAS WANTS WHICH MUST BE SATISFIED AND WHATEVER PAINS BE TAKEN TO DIVERT IT FROM ITSELF IT SOON GROWS WEARY RESTLESS AND DISQUIETED AMIDST THE ENJOYMENTS OF SENSE
CAUSES A SECRET IRRITATION TO THOSE WHO REAP ADVANTAGE FROM THEM BUT THE CHARM OF SIMPLICITY OF MANNERS IS ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE THEIR AFFABILITY CARRIES MEN AWAY
THE EVILS WHICH EXTREME EQUALITY MAY PRODUCE ARE SLOWLY DISCLOSED THEY CREEP GRADUALLY INTO THE SOCIAL FRAME THEY ARE ONLY SEEN AT INTERVALS
I DARE PREDICT THAT THEY WILL ALWAYS BE SURPASSED BY THE SPLENDOR OF ITS VICES THE TASTE FOR PHYSICAL GRATIFICATIONS LEADS A DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE INTO NO SUCH EXCESSES
OR HAS WORKED OR IS BORN OF PARENTS WHO HAVE WORKED THE NOTION OF LABOR IS THEREFORE PRESENTED TO THE MIND ON EVERY SIDE AS THE NECESSARY NATURAL AND HONEST CONDITION OF HUMAN EXISTENCE
AN ARISTOCRACY SELDOM YIELDS WITHOUT A PROTRACTED STRUGGLE IN THE COURSE OF WHICH IMPLACABLE ANIMOSITIES ARE KINDLED BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF SOCIETY
THE PASSIONS WHICH ACCOMPANIED THE CONTEST HAVE SURVIVED IT THEIR MINDS ARE AS IT WERE INTOXICATED BY THE SMALL ENJOYMENTS WHICH THEY HAVE PURSUED FOR FORTY YEARS
AND THAT AMBITION SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO FIX ITS GAZE LONG UPON AN OBJECT BEFORE IT IS GRATIFIED
AND AS THEY DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT THEY CAN HENCEFORWARD EVER HAVE OCCASION TO CLAIM THE ASSISTANCE OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES THEY DO NOT SCRUPLE TO SHOW THAT THEY CARE FOR NOBODY BUT THEMSELVES
SUDDENLY AS THEY STOOD IN ONE HALL
SHINE OVER ME MY SUN MY HEAVEN MY DAYLIGHT IONE IONE DO NOT REJECT MY LOVE ALONE AND IN THE POWER OF THIS SINGULAR AND FEARFUL MAN
DESCEND AND SEE THAT THE SLAVES ARE MARSHALLED
BY HIS TREASURES AND HIS ELOQUENCE
SLEEPLESS AND ALONE ON THE SUMMIT OF THE LOFTY AND PYRAMIDAL TOWER WHICH FLANKED HIS HOUSE A TALL PARAPET AROUND IT SERVED AS A WALL AND CONSPIRED
THE STREAM WAS NO LONGER DULL BUT INTENSELY AND FIERCELY LUMINOUS AND WHILE I GAZED THE BEAST THAT LIVETH WITH ME AND WAS COWERING BY MY SIDE
WHOSE MAJESTIC AND PASSIONLESS FEATURES THE MARBLE SO WELL PORTRAYED
MUTTERED ARBACES AS THE DOOR CLOSED ON THE HAG'S TATTERED ROBES AND IMPATIENT OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS NOT YET RECOVERED FROM THE PAST DREAM HE HASTILY SUMMONED HIS SLAVES
GLAUCUS SHOUTED HER NAME NO ANSWER CAME THEY RETRACED THEIR STEPS IN VAIN THEY COULD NOT DISCOVER HER
BUT AS AN OBSTACLE IN HIS PATH YET WAS HE NOT THE LESS RESOLVED THE LESS CRAFTY AND PERSEVERING IN THE COURSE HE PURSUED FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF ONE WHOSE DOOM WAS BECOME NECESSARY TO THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS OBJECTS AND WHILE
SOMETIMES THE HUGER STONES STRIKING AGAINST EACH OTHER AS THEY FELL BROKE INTO COUNTLESS FRAGMENTS EMITTING SPARKS OF FIRE WHICH CAUGHT WHATEVER WAS COMBUSTIBLE WITHIN THEIR REACH AND ALONG THE PLAINS BEYOND THE CITY
AND THE SILENCE OF DEATH AGAIN FELL OVER THE SCENE THERE WAS ONE OF THE FREQUENT PAUSES IN THE SHOWERS AND GLAUCUS ENCOURAGED IONE ONCE MORE TO PROCEED JUST AS THEY STOOD HESITATING ON THE LAST STEP OF THE PORTICO
TO THE SLAVE WHO HAD THE CHARGE OF THAT PART OF THE MANSION ALONE THEN AND MUSINGLY HE WAITED THE MORNING LIGHT AND WITH IT REPAIRED
IT MAY REVOLT IT MAY TERRIFY
HE BORE HER TO THE REMOTER AND MORE SHELTERED PART OF THE PORTICO
THE RED TILED ROOFS OF THE BRIGHT STREETS THE SOLEMN COLUMNS OF MANY TEMPLES AND THE STATUE CROWNED PORTALS OF THE FORUM AND THE ARCH OF TRIUMPH
THE DARKNESS WAS NOW TERRIBLY RELIEVED FOR SEVERAL HOUSES AND EVEN VINEYARDS HAD BEEN SET ON FLAMES AND AT VARIOUS INTERVALS THE FIRES ROSE SUDDENLY AND FIERCELY AGAINST THE SOLID GLOOM
AND CONVERSING THERE WITH HER HE LEARNED FROM THE CONFESSION OF HER DESPAIR AND REMORSE THAT HER HAND AND NOT JULIA'S HAD ADMINISTERED TO GLAUCUS THE FATAL POTION
THERE CREPT A HOARSE AND SULLEN MURMUR AS IT GLIDED BY THE LAUGHING PLAINS AND THE GAUDY VILLAS OF THE WEALTHY CITIZENS CLEAR ABOVE THE LOW MIST ROSE THE TIME WORN TOWERS OF THE IMMEMORIAL TOWN
VILLAS AND VILLAGES STRETCHED ON EVERY SIDE UP THE ASCENT OF VESUVIUS NOT NEARLY THEN SO STEEP OR SO LOFTY AS AT PRESENT FOR AS ROME ITSELF IS BUILT ON AN EXHAUSTED VOLCANO
DARE NOT TELL ME THAT DARE NOT MOCK ME IT IS IMPOSSIBLE WHOM HAST THOU SEEN WHOM KNOWN OH IONE IT IS THY WOMAN'S INVENTION THY WOMAN'S ART THAT SPEAKS
SO IN SIMILAR SECURITY THE INHABITANTS OF THE SOUTH TENANTED THE GREEN AND VINE CLAD PLACES
IT MOVED ON ITS TORTURED COUCH
LOSING ALL THE VULGAR AUDACITY OF HIS NATURAL CHARACTER VERILY THOU ART A MAGICIAN THOU READEST THE HEART AS IT WERE A SCROLL IT IS MY VOCATION ANSWERED THE EGYPTIAN LAUGHING GENTLY WELL THEN FORBEAR
AND THE GLADIATOR DID NOT RECEDE OR TREMBLE THE REVOLUTION OF NATURE HAD DISSOLVED HER LIGHTER TERRORS AS WELL AS HER WONTED TIES WHILE THEY WERE THUS TERRIBLY PROTECTED
AND BESOUGHT HIM TO RESTORE THE HEALTH AND SAVE THE LIFE OF GLAUCUS FOR IN HER YOUTH AND IGNORANCE SHE IMAGINED THE DARK MAGICIAN ALL POWERFUL TO EFFECT BOTH
HE WAS IN THE PRECINCTS OF DAY HE REJOICED HE SMILED HIS EYES FELL AND OPPOSITE TO HIM HE BEHELD THE GHASTLY FEATURES THE LIFELESS EYE THE LIVID LIP
COULD DISTORT THAN OF THE WOE WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT UPON HER
WAS A COLOSSAL HEAD OF THE BLACKEST MARBLE WHICH SHE PERCEIVED BY THE CROWN OF WHEAT EARS THAT ENCIRCLED THE BROW REPRESENTED THE GREAT EGYPTIAN GODDESS ARBACES STOOD BEFORE THE ALTAR
AND THENCE UPON THE PORTICO WITHOUT HE SAW THE DENSE MASSES OF MEN POURING FAST INTO THE AMPHITHEATRE AND HEARD THE CRY OF THE ASSISTANTS AND THE CRACKING OF THE CORDAGE
THOU KNOWEST THE VESSEL THAT LIES IN THE HARBOR WHICH BELONGED TO NARSES OF ALEXANDRIA I HAVE PURCHASED IT OF HIM THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE SHALL BEGIN TO REMOVE MY STORES SO SOON TIS WELL ARBACES SHALL BE OBEYED
WHAT DOTH SHE TOO AS THE CREDULOUS IMAGINE DOTH SHE TOO LEARN THE LORE OF THE GREAT STARS HATH SHE BEEN UTTERING FOUL MAGIC TO THE MOON OR CULLING
AFTER NOVEL LUXURIES AND INEXPERIENCED PLEASURES CHEERED BY MY STARS SUPPORTED BY THE OMENS OF MY SOUL WE WILL PENETRATE TO THOSE VAST AND GLORIOUS WORLDS WHICH MY WISDOM TELLS ME LIE YET UNTRACKED
THAN THE CRIME OF WHICH SHE HAD VAGUELY HEARD HIM ACCUSED OR THE CHANCES OF THE IMPENDING TRIAL POOR WRETCH THAT SHE WAS WHOM NONE ADDRESSED NONE CARED FOR WHAT DID SHE KNOW OF THE SENATE AND THE SENTENCE THE HAZARD OF THE LAW
BUT YONDER SAID HE
HE HAD LAID HIS GARLAND ON THE SHRINE
GLARED STONILY AND REMORSELESSLY ON HIS OWN WHAT ART THOU
ANSWERED CALENUS SINKING HIS VOICE INTO A WHISPER I WAS IN THE SACRED GROVE SHELTERED BY THE CHAPEL AND THE SURROUNDING FOLIAGE I OVERHEARD I MARKED THE WHOLE
THEN IS MY WISDOM VAIN GROANED THE DREAMER
ARE YE LESS HOMICIDES THAN I AM I SLAY BUT IN SELF DEFENCE YE MAKE MURDER PASTIME HE TURNED WITH A RESTLESS AND CURIOUS EYE TOWARDS VESUVIUS BEAUTIFULLY GLOWED THE GREEN VINEYARDS ROUND ITS BREAST
WHOSE FESTIVE AND GLITTERING GARMENTS CONTRASTED IN MOCKERY THE SOLEMN TERROR OF THE HOUR THEY DID NOT APPEAR TO HEED THE STRANGERS
THE COLUMN TREMBLED AND WAVED FROM SIDE TO SIDE
AND THE WITCH AND THE MAGIAN THE PUPIL AND THE MASTER THE GREAT ONE AND THE ACCURSED ONE MAY MEET AGAIN FAREWELL OUT CROAKER
THE PORTICO OF THE TEMPLE OF FORTUNE IS BEFORE US LET US CREEP BENEATH IT IT WILL PROTECT US FROM THE SHOWERS HE CAUGHT HIS BELOVED IN HIS ARMS AND WITH DIFFICULTY AND LABOR GAINED THE TEMPLE
SOME WERE VIVID WITH EXPECTATION AND HOPE SOME UNUTTERABLY DEJECTED BY AWE AND HORROR AND SO THEY PASSED SWIFT AND CONSTANTLY ON TILL THE EYES OF THE GAZER GREW DIZZY AND BLINDED
WHO HAD PLACED THE COSTLY GIFT OF ARBACES IN THE LOOSE FOLDS OF HER VEST NOW ROSE TO DEPART WHEN SHE HAD GAINED THE DOOR SHE PAUSED TURNED BACK AND SAID THIS MAY BE THE LAST TIME WE MEET ON EARTH
I HAVE DREAMED TILL I SAW THEE I WAKE AND I BEHOLD THEE
AND NOW LEAPED FIERCELY TO AND FRO DARTING ACROSS THE VAST GLOOM IN WILD GAMBOLS SUDDENLY DISAPPEARING AND AS SUDDENLY BURSTING INTO TENFOLD BRILLIANCY AND POWER
THE CONGENIALITIES THAT BIND US TO OTHERS EVER ASSIMILATE TO THE QUALITIES OF OUR OWN NATURE THE HERO WEEPS LESS AT THE REVERSES OF HIS ENEMY THAN AT THE FORTITUDE WITH WHICH HE BEARS THEM ALL OF US ARE HUMAN
PROTECT THY CHOSEN
SUDDENLY FROM THAT TRIPOD LEAPED INTO LIFE A BLUE QUICK DARTING
STABIAE AND HERCULANEUM AND POMPEII THOSE CHILDREN AND DARLINGS OF THE DEEP YE SLUMBER SAID THE EGYPTIAN
GIVES ME THE POSSESSION OF MY BRIDE
THE CITY SEEMED AS AFTER THE AWFUL CHANGE OF SEVENTEEN AGES IT SEEMS NOW TO THE TRAVELER A CITY OF THE DEAD THE OCEAN ITSELF THAT SERENE AND TIDELESS SEA
WHY IN THOSE PHLEGRAE NOW LAUGHING WITH THE VINE
AT ONCE SUDDENLY WITHOUT SOUND OR MOTION OR SEMBLANCE OF LIFE UPON THE FLOOR
AT THE SIGHT OF HER QUAINT AND PRIMAEVAL GARB OF HER WILD GAIT AND GESTURES THE PASSENGERS SHE ENCOUNTERED TOUCHED EACH OTHER AND SMILED BUT AS THEY CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HER COUNTENANCE THE MIRTH WAS HUSHED AT ONCE
A THIN AND DULL MIST GATHERED OVER THE VALLEYS AND HOLLOWS OF THE BROAD CAMPANIAN FIELDS BUT YET IT WAS REMARKED IN SURPRISE BY THE EARLY FISHERMEN THAT DESPITE THE EXCEEDING STILLNESS OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE WAVES OF THE SEA WERE AGITATED
WHILE IT BE TIME THOU KNOWEST THAT I HOLD MY HOME ON THAT MOUNTAIN BENEATH WHICH OLD TRADITION SAITH THERE YET BURN THE FIRES OF THE RIVER
NOR WAS THEIR HORRIBLE BEAUTY CONFINED TO THE USUAL HUES OF FIRE NO RAINBOW EVER RIVALLED THEIR VARYING AND PRODIGAL DYES NOW BRIGHTLY BLUE AS THE MOST AZURE DEPTH OF A SOUTHERN SKY
AND STRANGERS FROM THE POPULOUS NEIGHBORHOOD OF POMPEII AND NOISILY FAST CONFUSEDLY SWEPT THE MANY STREAMS OF LIFE TOWARDS THE FATAL SHOW DESPITE THE VAST SIZE OF THE AMPHITHEATRE
TELL ME I PRAY THEE WHEREFORE THOU WISHEST TO LIVE WHAT SWEETS DOST THOU DISCOVER IN EXISTENCE IT IS NOT LIFE THAT IS SWEET BUT DEATH THAT IS AWFUL
TAUGHT BY HIS SACRED PROFESSION AS WELL AS BY HIS KNOWLEDGE OF ARBACES TO DISTRUST ALL MIRACULOUS INTERPOSITIONS HAD NOT SHARED THE DISMAY OF HIS COMPANION HE RUSHED FORWARD
THE MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES RESTED ON ITS BEAUTY IT AWED BUT TERRIFIED NOT IT WAS THE INCARNATION OF THE SUBLIME AND ARBACES FELT THE VOICE LEAVE HIS LIPS
WITH APPARENT RELUCTANCE AND COMPASSION HE GAVE AGAINST GLAUCUS THE EVIDENCE WHICH CONDEMNED HIM HE SECRETLY AND THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE PRIESTHOOD FOMENTED THAT POPULAR INDIGNATION WHICH MADE AN EFFECTUAL OBSTACLE
MIGHT ELECT HIM TO THAT THRONE IN HER HEART FROM WHICH HIS RIVAL WOULD BE SO AWFULLY EXPELLED THIS WAS HIS HOPE BUT SHOULD IT FAIL HIS UNHOLY AND FERVID PASSION WHISPERED AT THE WORST NOW SHE IS IN MY POWER YET WITHAL
OF THE LION THERE WAS A SILENCE IN THE DISTANT CROWD BUT THE SILENCE WAS FOLLOWED BY JOYOUS LAUGHTER THEY WERE MAKING MERRY AT THE HUNGRY IMPATIENCE OF THE ROYAL BEAST BRUTES
IF GLAUCUS COULD NOT BE HER SLAVE NEITHER COULD HE BE THE ADORER OF HER RIVAL THIS WAS SUFFICIENT CONSOLATION FOR ANY REGRET AT HIS FATE VOLATILE AND FICKLE SHE BEGAN AGAIN TO BE MOVED BY THE SUDDEN
AT ANOTHER TIME THE EGYPTIAN MIGHT HAVE CONCEIVED A PHILOSOPHICAL INTEREST IN SOUNDING THE DEPTHS AND ORIGIN
NOW WHICH WAY COULD THEY WEND ALL WAS RAYLESS TO THEM A MAZE WITHOUT A CLUE WEARIED DESPONDENT BEWILDERED THEY HOWEVER PASSED ALONG THE ASHES FALLING UPON THEIR HEADS
AND THOU ART DESTINED TO BE THE BRIDE OF ARBACES
WRETCH WOULDST THOU ROB THY FATHER AY WHO CAN TELL THE TALE IN THIS HOUR MISER PERISH THE BOY STRUCK THE OLD MAN TO THE GROUND PLUCKED THE BAG FROM HIS RELAXING HAND
CREEP SLOWLY SLOWLY ON AND HEARD MANY AND MIGHTY SOUNDS HISSING AND ROARING THROUGH THE GLOOM BUT LAST NIGHT AS I LOOKED THEREON BEHOLD
A GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN BEARING TORCHES PASSED BY THE TEMPLE
THE EYES BECAME LIKE BALLS OF LURID FIRE
THOU HAST PILES OF GOLD OF VASES AND OF JEWELS WHICH MIGHT RIVAL THE RECEPTACLES OF THE WEALTH OF THE DEIFIED NERO
AND AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT A BANQUET ROSE FROM THE FLOOR A COUCH OR THRONE
THE WORN AND PALLID CHEEK OF HIS VICTIM TOUCHED HIM LESS THAN THE FIRMNESS OF HIS NERVES AND THE DAUNTLESSNESS OF HIS BROW FOR ARBACES WAS ONE WHO HAD LITTLE PITY FOR WHAT WAS UNFORTUNATE BUT A STRONG SYMPATHY FOR WHAT WAS BOLD
RAPIDLY THE EYES OF ARBACES RAN OVER THE WRITING THE NEAPOLITAN DID NOT DARE TO GAZE UPON HIM SHE DID NOT SEE THE DEADLY PALENESS THAT CAME OVER HIS COUNTENANCE
BEAR AWAY WITH THEE THIS NIGHT AS MUCH AS THOU CANST CONCEAL BENEATH THY ROBES NAY WHEN THOU HAST ONCE SEEN WHAT THY FRIEND POSSESSES
BEAUTIFUL IONE SAID ARBACES AS HE BENT TO TOUCH HER HAND IT IS YOU THAT HAVE ECLIPSED THE DAY IT IS YOUR EYES THAT LIGHT UP THE HALLS IT IS YOUR BREATH WHICH FILLS THEM WITH PERFUMES
AND ISSUING FROM ONE OF THE CHAMBERS THAT BORDERED THE COLONNADE SUDDENLY ENCOUNTERED ARBACES
THE GRATEFUL CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SHE SHARES THE LOT OF ONE WHO FAR FROM THE AGED ROTTENNESS OF THIS SLAVISH CIVILIZATION RESTORES THE PRIMAL ELEMENTS OF GREATNESS AND UNITES IN ONE MIGHTY SOUL
YOU MUST NOT TALK TO ME THUS SAID IONE SMILING YOU FORGET THAT YOUR LORE HAS SUFFICIENTLY INSTRUCTED MY MIND TO RENDER THESE GRACEFUL FLATTERIES TO MY PERSON UNWELCOME IT WAS YOU WHO TAUGHT ME TO DISDAIN ADULATION
MEANWHILE
THEY IMAGINED NOW THAT THE DAY HAD COME
FILLED UP THE INTERSTICES OF THE COLUMNS THE MOST PRECIOUS WOODS LINED THE THRESHOLDS AND COMPOSED THE DOORS
AFTER THE TRANQUILLITY OF SIXTEEN YEARS
SAID SHE WONDERINGLY THAT YOU WERE RICH BUT I NEVER DREAMED OF THE AMOUNT OF YOUR WEALTH WOULD I COULD COIN IT ALL
IT SEEMED LOCKED AS IN DEATH BLOOD GUSHED FROM THE EGYPTIAN'S LIPS OVER HIS GLITTERING ROBES HE FELL HEAVILY FROM THE ARMS OF GLAUCUS AND THE RED STREAM TRICKLED SLOWLY ALONG THE MARBLE AGAIN THE EARTH SHOOK BENEATH THEIR FEET
NO HUMAN EMOTION DISTURBED ITS BROODING AND UNWRINKLED BROW THERE WAS NEITHER SADNESS NOR JOY NOR MEMORY NOR HOPE IT WAS FREE FROM ALL WITH WHICH THE WILD HUMAN HEART CAN SYMPATHIZE
WOE TO YE OF THE FASCES AND THE PURPLE WOE TO THE IDOLATER AND THE WORSHIPPER OF THE BEAST WOE TO YE WHO POUR FORTH THE BLOOD OF SAINTS AND GLOAT OVER THE DEATH PANGS OF THE SONS OF GOD WOE TO THE HARLOT OF THE SEA
BEHOLD THE LORD DESCENDETH TO JUDGMENT HE MAKETH FIRE COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN IN THE SIGHT OF MEN
AND STOOPING EVER AND ANON AS IF TO PLUCK ITS RANK PRODUCE HO SAID HE ALOUD I HAVE THEN ANOTHER COMPANION IN THESE UNWORLDLY NIGHT WATCHES
SHE AGAIN TORE HERSELF FROM HIM
AS THE EGYPTIAN UTTERED A PREDICTION WHICH FATE SO FEARFULLY FULFILLED
TO PREVENT HER INTERESTING HERSELF ACTIVELY IN THE TRIAL OF GLAUCUS AND ALSO TO GUARD AGAINST HER ACCUSING HIM WHICH SHE WOULD DOUBTLESS HAVE DONE OF HIS FORMER ACT OF PERFIDY AND VIOLENCE TOWARDS HER HIS WARD
TO APPOINTED AND SPECIAL SEATS AND THE INTENSE CURIOSITY WHICH THE TRIAL AND SENTENCE OF TWO CRIMINALS SO REMARKABLE HAD OCCASIONED INCREASED THE CROWD ON THIS DAY TO AN EXTENT WHOLLY UNPRECEDENTED
WITH ITS STONY SEATS RISING ONE ABOVE THE OTHER COILED AND ROUND AS SOME SLUMBERING MONSTER ROSE A THIN AND GHASTLY MIST WHICH GATHERED DARKER AND MORE DARK OVER THE SCATTERED FOLIAGE THAT GLOOMED IN ITS VICINITY
NYDIA WAS TORN FROM THE SIDE OF GLAUCUS WHO WITH IONE WAS BORNE RAPIDLY ONWARD AND WHEN THE CROWD WHOSE FORMS THEY SAW NOT SO THICK WAS THE GLOOM WERE GONE NYDIA WAS STILL SEPARATED FROM THEIR SIDE
AS IF BORNE INVOLUNTARILY ADOWN THE SIDES OF SOME INVISIBLE STREAM AND THE FACES OF THESE SPECTRES WERE MORE DISTINCT THAN THOSE THAT EMERGED FROM THE OPPOSITE PASSAGE AND ON SOME WAS JOY AND ON OTHERS SORROW
CONDEMNATION BEFORE THOU HAST VENTURED TO TELL ME THAT ARBACES IS A MURDERER AND HAVING TARRIED SO LONG WHY REVEALEST THOU NOW THAT KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE BECAUSE STAMMERED CALENUS COLORING AND IN CONFUSION
THEY ROCKED TO AND FRO THEY SWAYED FROM END TO END OF THEIR CONFINED ARENA
RIGHT UPON HIS BENDED FORM
IONE TREMBLE NOT THOU ART MY QUEEN MY GODDESS BE MY BRIDE ALL THE WISHES THOU CANST FORM SHALL BE FULFILLED THE ENDS OF THE EARTH SHALL MINISTER TO THEE POMP
AND HOW DID MEN CHANGE THE SOIL BY TILLING IT WITH THE PLOUGH TO SWEETEN IT AND MANURING IT TO MAKE IT RICH AND THEN DID ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL GRASSES GROW UP OF THEMSELVES YOU OUGHT TO KNOW THAT THEY MOST LIKELY DID NOT
SO USE YOUR EYES AND YOUR INTELLECT YOUR SENSES AND YOUR BRAINS AND LEARN WHAT GOD IS TRYING TO TEACH YOU CONTINUALLY BY THEM I DO NOT MEAN THAT YOU MUST STOP THERE AND LEARN NOTHING MORE ANYTHING BUT THAT
LIKE ALL LADY WHY'S MESSAGES IS AT HEART A MERCIFUL AND LOVING ONE
A LIVE MANURE CART YES CHILD IF YOU HAD SEEN AS I HAVE SEEN IN FOREIGN LANDS POOR WOMEN HAGGARD DIRTY GROWN OLD BEFORE THEIR YOUTH WAS OVER
AND THE PRICE AND QUALITY OF THE LIQUOR ON THE OTHER HAND FRANKLIN COULD NOT CROSS THE CHANNEL WITHOUT MAKING OBSERVATIONS USEFUL TO MANKIND WHILE MANY A VACANT THOUGHTLESS YOUTH IS WHIRLED THROUGH EUROPE WITHOUT GAINING A SINGLE IDEA WORTH CROSSING THE STREET FOR
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE ALL THAT AWAY WITHOUT PUTTING ANYTHING IN ITS PLACE WHY NOT IF I TOOK ALL THE BUTTER OUT OF THE CHURN WHAT MUST I DO IF I WANT MORE BUTTER STILL
THERE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME I TRUST THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND ME SOME DAY MEANWHILE I THINK I ONLY SAY I THINK YOU KNOW I TOLD YOU HOW HUMBLE WE MUST BE WHENEVER WE SPEAK OF LADY WHY
AT ALL EVENTS THE PLANTS OUTSIDE ARE ON THE WHOLE QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE HAY FIELD OF COURSE THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE FIELD LOOK GREEN AND THE MOOR BROWN NOT A DOUBT
AND THEREFORE IT IS A FLESH AND MILK MANUFACTORY WE MUST PUT INTO IT EVERY YEAR YARD STUFF TANK STUFF GUANO BONES AND ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING OF THAT KIN
HE FLOODS ALL THE SLOPES WITH YELLOW LIGHT MAKING THEM STAND OUT SHARP AGAINST THE BLACK SHADOWS OF THE WOOD WHILE WHERE THE GRASS IS STANDING STILL HE MAKES THE SHEETS OF SORREL FLOWER BLUSH ROSY RED
WHICH THEY USED TO CATCH IN THE DRAUGHT AND DUST OF THE UNHEALTHIEST PLACE IN THE WHOLE PARISH WHICH IS THE OLD FASHIONED BARN'S FLOOR AND SO WE MAY HOPE IN FUTURE YEARS ALL HEAVY DRUDGERY AND DIRTY WORK
ESPECIALLY IF THEY LIVE IN A PART OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE HAVE NOT BEEN OURSELVES BUT I THINK THAT WE KNOW AND THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN ENOUGH ABOUT EARTHQUAKES TO HAVE BEEN MORE PRUDENT THAN THEY HAVE BEEN FOR MANY A YEAR
AND THEY WILL SEND YOU JUST THE SEEDS WHICH WILL GROW THERE AND NO OTHER AND THEN YOU HAVE A GOOD PASTURE FOR AS LONG AS YOU CHOOSE TO KEEP IT GOOD AND HOW IS IT KEPT GOOD
STORM THEM PULL THEM DOWN BUILD THEM UP AGAIN SHOUT LAUGH AND SCREAM TILL YOU ARE HOT AND TIRED YOU WILL PLEASE MADAM HOW THEREBY AND LADY WHY LIKEWISE HOW BECAUSE MADAM HOW NATURALLY WANTS HER WORK TO SUCCEED
ALL COVERED WITH WOODS OF BOX WHICH SMELT RICH AND HOT AND MUSKY IN THE WARM SPRING AIR AMONG THE BOX TREES AND FALLEN BOULDERS GREW HEPATICAS BLUE AND WHITE AND RED SUCH AS YOU SEE IN THE GARDEN
AS YOU HAVE USED THE EYES AND THE COMMON SENSE WHICH GOD HAS GIVEN YOU AND HAVE CONSIDERED THE LILIES OF THE FIELD HOW THEY GROW
DO YOU NOT THINK WE SHOULD KNOW WHAT HE MEANT EVEN THOUGH HE NEVER SPOKE A WORD HE WOULD BE VERY WRONG IN BEHAVING SO OF COURSE
BECOME A GREAT RICH AND HAPPY NATION INSTEAD OF THE IDLE AND USELESS
ON SUBJECTS WHICH WERE ONLY TALKED OF FIFTY YEARS AGO BY A FEW LEARNED MEN AND VERY LITTLE UNDERSTOOD EVEN BY THEM SO IF MERE READING OF BOOKS WOULD MAKE WISE MEN YOU OUGHT TO GROW UP MUCH WISER THAN US OLD FELLOWS
WHICH HAVE SPRUNG UP IN THE LAST TWO DAYS FOR THE CATTLE WHEN THEY ARE TURNED IN NEXT WEEK BUT IF THE MACHINE CUTS ALL THE GRASS THE POOR MOWERS WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO NOT SO
WHY SHOULD THERE NOT HAVE BEEN ONLY ONE SORT OF BUTTERFLY AND HE ONLY OF ONE COLOUR A PLAIN BROWN OR A PLAIN WHITE AND WHY SHOULD THERE BE SO MANY SORTS OF BIRDS ALL ROBBING THE GARDEN AT ONCE
AND I WILL TELL YOU WHY I WAS TRAVELLING IN THE PYRENEES AND I CAME ONE EVENING TO THE LOVELIEST SPOT A GLEN OR RATHER A VAST CRACK IN THE MOUNTAINS SO NARROW THAT THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR ANYTHING AT THE BOTTOM OF IT
TELLS HIM ALL ABOUT HIS CURIOSITIES AND THEN IT COMES OUT IF YOU WILL BELIEVE IT THAT MASTER WILLIAM HAS BEEN OVER THE VERY SAME GROUND AS MASTER ROBERT WHO SAW NOTHING AT ALL
OR DAPPLES THE FIELD WITH WHITE OXEYES BUT IS NOT THE SORREL ITSELF RED AND THE OXEYES WHITE WHAT COLOUR ARE THEY AT NIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS GONE DARK THAT IS NO COLOUR
OUT OF EACH OF WHICH POURED IN FOAMING WATERFALLS STREAMS LARGE ENOUGH TO TURN A MILL AND ABOVE THEM MOUNTAINS PILED ON MOUNTAINS
YOU WOULD AGREE WITH ME THAT THE STRONGEST THING WE KNOW OF IN THE WORLD IS STEAM NOW I THINK THAT WE CAN EXPLAIN ALMOST IF NOT QUITE ALL THAT WE KNOW ABOUT EARTHQUAKES IF WE BELIEVE THAT ON THE WHOLE THEY ARE CAUSED BY STEAM
THERE WERE NO SUCH CHILDREN'S BOOKS AS THERE ARE NOW THOSE WHICH WE HAD WERE FEW AND DULL AND THE PICTURES IN THEM UGLY AND MEAN WHILE YOU HAVE YOUR CHOICE OF BOOKS WITHOUT NUMBER CLEAR AMUSING AND PRETTY AS WELL AS REALLY INSTRUCTIVE
FOR ONE CANNOT EAT ONE'S CAKE AND KEEP IT TOO AND NO MORE CAN ONE EAT ONE'S GRASS SO THIS FIELD IS A TRULY WONDERFUL PLACE IT IS NO UGLY PILE OF BRICK AND MORTAR
AND CUTTING IT BETTER TOO FOR THE MOWING MACHINE GOES SO MUCH NEARER TO THE GROUND THAN THE SCYTHE THAT WE GAIN BY IT TWO HUNDREDWEIGHT OF HAY ON EVERY ACRE AND SEE TOO HOW PERSEVERING OLD MADAM HOW WILL NOT STOP HER WORK
BUT WHY DOES LADY WHY LIKE TO SEE US PLAY SHE LIKES TO SEE YOU HAPPY AS SHE LIKES TO SEE THE TREES AND BIRDS HAPPY FOR SHE KNOWS WELL THAT THERE IS NO FOOD NOR MEDICINE EITHER LIKE HAPPINESS
THERE IS A PROOF TO US OF WHAT MEN MAY DO IF THEY WILL ONLY LEARN THE LESSONS WHICH MADAM HOW CAN TEACH THEM THERE IS THAT BOY FRESH FROM THE NATIONAL SCHOOL CUTTING MORE GRASS IN A DAY THAN SIX STRONG MOWERS COULD HAVE CUT
THE FATHER SHOULD HELP LIKEWISE IS AS YOU WILL FIND OUT AS YOU GROW OLDER MORE WONDERFUL FAR SO THERE ALREADY THE OLD STARLING HAS SET US TWO FRESH PUZZLES ABOUT HOW AND WHY NEITHER OF WHICH WE SHALL GET ANSWERED
THOUGH IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE A GERANIUM LOOK RED NOT RED NO THE GERANIUM FLOWERS BY A LANTERN LOOK BLACK WHILE THE LEAVES LOOK GREEN IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME WE WILL TRY
INSTEAD OF NEGLECTING THEM AS THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR NOW THREE HUNDRED YEARS THEY WOULD BE A BLESSING TO THE EARTH INSTEAD OF BEING THAT WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN GOD GRANT MY DEAR CHILD
AND NOW BE OFF AND PLAY IN THE HAY AND COME BACK TO ME WHEN YOU ARE TIRED
BUT MERE READING OF WISE BOOKS WILL NOT MAKE YOU WISE MEN YOU MUST USE FOR YOURSELVES THE TOOLS WITH WHICH BOOKS ARE MADE WISE AND THAT IS YOUR EYES AND EARS AND COMMON SENSE
YOU WILL LEARN SOMETHING OF THE REASON OF THINGS FOR THAT THIRST TO KNOW WHY WAS PUT INTO THE HEARTS OF LITTLE CHILDREN BY GOD HIMSELF AND I BELIEVE THAT GOD WOULD NEVER HAVE GIVEN THEM THAT THIRST IF HE HAD NOT MEANT TO SATISFY IT
SOMETHING VERY LIKE WHAT THE BIBLE CALLS TEMPTING GOD STAKING THEIR PROPERTY AND THEIR LIVES UPON THE CHANCES OF NO EARTHQUAKES COMING WHILE THEY OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT AN EARTHQUAKE MIGHT COME ANY DAY THEY HAVE FULFILLED
AND A LITTLE STITCHWORT AND PIGNUT AND MOUSE EAR HAWKWEED TOO WHICH NOBODY WANTS WHY
IF YOU WILL OUT OF THE TYRANNY OF DARKNESS AND DISTRUST AND FEAR INTO GOD'S FREE KINGDOM OF LIGHT AND FAITH AND LOVE AND WILL BE SAFE FROM THE VENOM OF THAT TREE
IT DROPS ITS VENOM INTO THE TENDEREST HEARTS ALAS AND MAKES THEM CALL WRONG RIGHT AND RIGHT WRONG LOVE CRUELTY AND CRUELTY LOVE
THRUSHES AND BLACKBIRDS AND SPARROWS AND CHAFFINCHES AND GREENFINCHES AND BULLFINCHES AND TOMTITS AND THERE ARE FOUR KINDS OF TOMTITS ROUND HERE REMEMBER BUT WE MAY GO ON WITH SUCH TALK FOR EVER
HOW DOES HE KNOW THAT WE MIGHT HURT HIM AND HOW AGAIN DOES HE NOT KNOW THAT WE SHALL NOT HURT HIM WE WHO FOR FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS HAVE LET HIM AND HIS ANCESTORS BUILD UNDER THOSE EAVES IN PEACE HOW DID HE GET THAT QUANTITY OF HALF WIT
YOU MUST LEARN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THINGS BEFORE YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW THOSE DIFFERENCES CAME ABOUT YOU MUST LEARN MADAM HOW'S ALPHABET BEFORE YOU CAN READ HER BOOK AND MADAM HOW'S ALPHABET OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS IS SPECIES
WHAT DO YOU MEAN LOOK OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARY FENCE AT THE MOORS AND WOODS THEY ARE FOREST WILD WALD AS THE GERMANS WOULD CALL IT INSIDE THE FENCE IS FIELD FELD AS THE GERMANS WOULD CALL IT
AND SHE IS AT WORK NOW MAKING YOU MAKING ME OF COURSE MAKING A MAN OF YOU OUT OF A BOY AND THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY THE LIFE BLOOD WHICH RUNS THROUGH AND THROUGH YOU AND THE MORE YOU LAUGH AND SHOUT
JUST AS THE BUTTER GROWS IN THE CHURN SO YOU MUST PUT FRESH GRASS STUFF CONTINUALLY INTO THE SOIL AS YOU PUT FRESH CREAM INTO THE CHURN YOU HAVE HEARD THE FARM MEN SAY THAT CROP HAS TAKEN A GOOD DEAL OUT OF THE LAND
AS YOU WOULD FIND IF YOU TRIED TO SEE WHAT MAKES THAT MIDSUMMER HUM OF WHICH THE HAYMAKERS ARE SO FOND BECAUSE IT PROMISES FAIR WEATHER WHY IT IS ONLY THE GNATS AND FLIES ONLY THE GNATS AND FLIES
AT LEAST WE WILL HOPE THAT THOUGH THEY WOULD NOT LEARN THEIR LESSON TILL THIS YEAR THEY WILL LEARN IT NOW AND WILL LISTEN TO THE MESSAGE WHICH I THINK MADAM HOW HAS BROUGHT THEM SPOKEN IN A VOICE OF THUNDER
THE OBSERVING EYE AND INQUIRING MIND FIND MATTER OF IMPROVEMENT AND DELIGHT IN EVERY RAMBLE YOU THEN WILLIAM CONTINUE TO USE YOUR EYES AND YOU ROBERT
IS STEAM HAS DONE BOTH THE LID OF THE KETTLE RATTLES BECAUSE THE EXPANDING STEAM ESCAPES IN LITTLE JETS AND SO CAUSES A LID QUAKE NOW SUPPOSE THAT THERE WAS STEAM UNDER THE EARTH TRYING TO ESCAPE
WELL THE ROCKS HAVE BEEN WHERE THEY ARE FOR MANY A YEAR AND THEY WILL WAIT OUR LEISURE PATIENTLY ENOUGH BUT MIDSUMMER AND THE HAY FIELD WILL NOT WAIT
AND WHEN HE SET FADE INTO DULL COLD GRAY TILL THE BRIGHT MOON CAME OUT TO LIGHT THEM UP ONCE MORE WHEN I WAS TIRED OF WONDERING AND ADMIRING I WENT INTO BED
NOW DO YOU REMEMBER THAT RIDDLE WHICH I PUT TO YOU THE OTHER DAY WHAT HAD THE RATTLING OF THE LID OF THE KETTLE TO DO WITH HARTFORD BRIDGE FLAT BEING LIFTED OUT OF THE ANCIENT SEA THE ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE I BELIEVE
AND SO ON AND SO ON TILL HE HAD BROUGHT HOME CURIOSITIES ENOUGH AND THOUGHTS ENOUGH TO LAST HIM A WEEK
COMING SURELY FROM THAT ONE FOUNTAIN OF ALL DUTY AND ALL LOVE WHICH MAKES YOUR FATHER WORK FOR YOU THAT THE MOTHER SHOULD TAKE CARE OF HER YOUNG IS WONDERFUL ENOUGH BUT THAT AT LEAST AMONG MANY BIRDS
GOD HAS GIVEN YOU EYES IT IS YOUR DUTY TO GOD TO USE THEM IF YOUR PARENTS TRIED TO TEACH YOU YOUR LESSONS IN THE MOST AGREEABLE WAY BY BEAUTIFUL PICTURE BOOKS WOULD IT NOT BE UNGRACIOUS UNGRATEFUL AND ALTOGETHER NAUGHTY AND WRONG
JUST PICK OUT ALL THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PLANTS AND FLOWERS YOU CAN FIND ROUND US HERE HOW MANY DO YOU THINK THERE ARE OH THERE SEEM TO BE FOUR OR FIVE
BUT REMEMBER THIS YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPINESS IS THEN IF YOU WISH TO PLEASE LADY WHY AND LADY WHY'S LORD AND KING LIKEWISE YOU WILL NEVER PASS A LITTLE CHILD WITHOUT TRYING TO MAKE IT HAPPIER EVEN BY A PASSING SMILE
AND WRITTEN IN LETTERS OF FLAME AND WHAT IS THAT MY DEAR CHILD IF THE LANDLORD OF OUR HOUSE WAS IN THE HABIT OF PULLING THE ROOF DOWN UPON OUR HEADS AND PUTTING GUNPOWDER UNDER THE FOUNDATIONS TO BLOW US UP
I WISH I KNEW HOW FAR THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE HAPPY FOR HAPPY THEY MUST BE WHETHER THEY KNOW IT OR NOT I WISH I KNEW HOW THEY LIVE AT ALL I WISH I EVEN KNEW HOW MANY SORTS THERE ARE HUMMING ROUND US AT THIS MOMENT HOW MANY KINDS
HOWEVER THERE IS ANOTHER QUESTION WHICH MADAM HOW SEEMS INCLINED TO ANSWER JUST NOW WHICH IS ALMOST AS DEEP AND MYSTERIOUS WHAT HOW ALL THESE DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BECAME DIFFERENT OH
THE MORE PURE AIR WILL PASS INTO YOUR BLOOD AND MAKE IT RED AND HEALTHY AND THE MORE YOU ROMP AND PLAY UNLESS YOU OVERTIRE YOURSELF THE QUICKER WILL THAT BLOOD FLOW THROUGH ALL YOUR LIMBS TO MAKE BONE AND MUSCLE
A WHOLE LONG DREAM TO ACCOUNT FOR IT AND YET THAT DREAM WHICH SEEMS TO YOU TO BE HOURS LONG HAS NOT TAKEN UP A SECOND OF TIME FOR THE VERY SAME NOISE WHICH BEGINS THE DREAM WAKES YOU AT THE END OF IT
AND OTHER GASES EXPANDING THAT IS SPREADING OUT WITH WONDERFUL QUICKNESS AND STRENGTH OF COURSE THERE MUST BE SOMETHING TO MAKE THEM EXPAND AND THAT IS HEAT BUT WE WILL NOT TALK OF THAT YET
YOU MUST LEARN THE ALPHABET IF YOU MEAN TO READ AND YOU MUST LEARN THE VALUE OF THE FIGURES BEFORE YOU CAN DO A SUM WHY WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF ANY ONE WHO SAT DOWN TO PLAY AT CARDS FOR MONEY TOO WHICH I HOPE AND TRUST YOU NEVER WILL DO
FOR THEY LEARN MEAN SLY SLAVISH WAYS WHICH GOD FORBID YOU SHOULD EVER LEARN WELL SAID THE WISE MAN THE HUMAN PLANT LIKE THE VEGETABLES CAN ONLY FLOWER IN SUNSHINE SO DO YOU GO AND ENJOY YOURSELF IN THE SUNSHINE
OR TOUCH BUT YOU MUST BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING IN ORDER TO END AT THE END AND SOW THE SEED IF YOU WISH TO GATHER THE FRUIT GOD HAS ORDAINED THAT YOU AND EVERY CHILD WHICH COMES INTO THE WORLD SHOULD BEGIN BY LEARNING SOMETHING OF THE WORLD ABOUT HIM
WELL AND THIS HAY FIELD IS A MANUFACTORY
BUT WHY SHOULD THERE BE SO MANY KINDS OF LIVING THINGS WOULD NOT ONE OR TWO HAVE DONE JUST AS WELL
UNLESS WE BE WATCHFUL INTO YOUR HEARTS AND MINE AND ITS NAME IS THE TREE OF UNREASON WHOSE ROOTS ARE CONCEIT AND IGNORANCE AND ITS JUICES FOLLY AND DEATH
USE HORSEFLESH NOT EAT IT NO WE HAVE NOT GOT AS FAR AS THAT WE DID NOT EVEN MAKE UP OUR MINDS TO TASTE THE CAMBRIDGE DONKEY BUT EVERY TIME THE HORSE DRAWS THE CARRIAGE HE USES UP SO MUCH MUSCLE
THE VERY GRASS IS NOT GREEN AT NIGHT OH BUT IT IS IF YOU LOOK AT IT WITH A LANTERN NO NO IT IS THE LIGHT OF THE LANTERN WHICH HAPPENS TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE THE LEAVES LOOK GREEN
FOR IN THAT EASTERN PART OF THEIR OWN LAND GOD'S GIFTS ARE WAITING FOR THEM IN A PARADISE SUCH AS I CAN NEITHER DESCRIBE NOR YOU CONCEIVE PRECIOUS WOODS FRUITS DRUGS AND WHAT NOT
WE MUST BE VERY SHORT SIGHTED OR VERY SHALLOW HEARTED THERE IS THE OLD COCK STARLING SCREECHING IN THE EAVES BECAUSE HE WANTS TO FRIGHTEN US AWAY AND TAKE A WORM TO HIS CHILDREN WITHOUT OUR FINDING OUT WHEREABOUTS HIS HOLE IS
AND IF YOU KNEW ALL THE NATURAL SCIENCE THAT EVER WAS OR EVER WILL BE KNOWN TO MEN THAT WOULD NOT SATISFY YOU FOR IT WOULD ONLY TELL YOU THE CAUSES OF THINGS WHILE YOUR SOULS WANT TO KNOW THE REASONS OF THINGS BESIDES
BUT WHY IS THAT WHY I CANNOT TELL AND HOW YOU HAD BEST ASK PROFESSOR TYNDALL IF YOU EVER HAVE THE HONOUR OF MEETING HIM BUT NOW HARK TO THE MOWING MACHINE HUMMING LIKE A GIANT NIGHT JAR
THEY ARE SO DIFFERENT THAT THEY LOOK LIKE BITS OF TWO DIFFERENT CONTINENTS SCRAMBLING OVER THE FENCE IS LIKE SCRAMBLING OUT OF EUROPE INTO AUSTRALIA NOW HOW WAS THAT DIFFERENCE MADE THINK DON'T GUESS BUT THINK
AND SO IT WAS WITH ME I DREAMED THAT SOME ENGLISH PEOPLE HAD COME INTO THE HOTEL WHERE I WAS AND WERE SLEEPING IN THE ROOM UNDERNEATH ME AND THAT THEY HAD QUARRELLED AND FOUGHT AND BROKE THEIR BED DOWN WITH A TREMENDOUS CRASH
AND THOSE THAT ARE MOST LIKE NEAREST TO EACH OTHER AND TO COMPARE THEM YOU MUST DO THAT WITH THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF THINGS BEFORE YOU CAN READ ONE PAGE OF MADAM HOW'S NATURAL HISTORY BOOK RIGHTLY
WHY DOES THE RICH GRASS COME UP TO THE BANK AND YET NOT SPREAD BEYOND IT I SUPPOSE BECAUSE IT CANNOT GET OVER NOT GET OVER WOULD NOT THE WIND BLOW THE SEEDS AND THE BIRDS CARRY THEM THEY DO GET OVER
AND OVER THE TROPIC SEAS DOWN TO THE EQUATOR AND THE PALM GROVES OF THE ETERNAL SUMMER IF WE CANNOT FIND SOMETHING EVEN AT STARTING FROM THE OPEN DOOR TO TEACH US ABOUT WHY AND HOW
BY HIS SENSES AND HIS BRAIN AND THE BETTER YOU LEARN WHAT THEY CAN TEACH YOU THE MORE FIT YOU WILL BE TO LEARN WHAT THEY CANNOT TEACH YOU THE MORE YOU TRY NOW TO UNDERSTAND THINGS THE MORE YOU WILL BE ABLE HEREAFTER TO UNDERSTAND MEN
THOUGH THE MACHINE HAS CUT OFF ALL THE GRASS WHICH SHE HAS BEEN MAKING FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS FOR AS FAST AS WE SHEAR IT OFF SHE MAKES IT GROW AGAIN THERE ARE FRESH BLADES HERE AT OUR FEET A FULL INCH LONG
UNHAPPINESS IF IT GOES ON TOO LONG WEARS THEM OUT BODY AND MIND AND THEY GROW ILL AND DIE OF BROKEN HEARTS AND BROKEN BRAINS MY CHILD AND SO AT LAST POOR SOULS FIND REST BENEATH THE CROSS
DOES HE LABOUR ALL DAY LONG HUNTING FOR WORMS AND INSECTS FOR HIS CHILDREN WHILE HIS WIFE NURSES THEM IN THE NEST WHY TOO DID HE HELP HER TO BUILD THAT NEST WITH TOIL AND CARE THIS SPRING
SEEMED TO BE STILL A GOOD WAY OFF I KNOW WHAT I WILL DO I AM SURE IT WILL BE BEST NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I WILL STICK TO THE RAFT AS LONG AS HER TIMBERS HOLD TOGETHER BUT WHEN THE SEA BREAKS HER UP I WILL SWIM FOR IT
POPLAR AND SWEET SMELLING CYPRESS TREES WHEREIN ALL KINDS OF GREAT BIRDS HAD BUILT THEIR NESTS OWLS HAWKS AND CHATTERING SEA CROWS THAT OCCUPY THEIR BUSINESS IN THE WATERS
FIERCE AND FULL OF FURY NEVERTHELESS THOSE WHO WERE IN THE BODY OF THE COURT WERE STILL BOTH BRAVE AND MANY THEN
AND THE DART WENT CLEAN THROUGH HIM SO THAT HE FELL FORWARD FULL ON HIS FACE UPON THE GROUND THEN MINERVA FROM HER SEAT ON THE RAFTER
THIS WILL ASTONISH EVERYBODY AND YOU CAN THEN BURY THEIR CITY UNDER THE MOUNTAIN WHEN EARTH ENCIRCLING NEPTUNE HEARD THIS HE WENT TO SCHERIA WHERE THE PHAEACIANS LIVE AND STAYED THERE TILL THE SHIP WHICH WAS MAKING RAPID WAY HAD GOT CLOSE IN
BUT AS SOON AS THEY HAD HAD ENOUGH TO EAT AND DRINK
WINDS FROM EAST SOUTH NORTH AND WEST FELL UPON HIM ALL AT THE SAME TIME AND A TREMENDOUS SEA GOT UP SO THAT ULYSSES HEART BEGAN TO FAIL HIM ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY WHAT EVER WILL BECOME OF ME
BUT MINERVA MADE THEM ALL OF NO EFFECT ONE HIT THE DOOR POST ANOTHER WENT AGAINST THE DOOR THE POINTED SHAFT OF ANOTHER STRUCK THE WALL AND AS SOON AS THEY HAD AVOIDED ALL THE SPEARS OF THE SUITORS
HE SAW FOR CERTAIN WHAT MIND THEY WERE OF ULYSSES SAID IT IS I ULYSSES WHO AM HERE I HAVE SUFFERED MUCH BUT AT LAST IN THE TWENTIETH YEAR I AM COME BACK TO MY OWN COUNTRY
I MAY ESCAPE THE COLD AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S REST BUT SOME SAVAGE BEAST MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME AND DEVOUR ME
NOT A MAN OF YOU SHALL THEIR HEARTS SANK AS THEY HEARD HIM
SO GO CUT SOME BEAMS OF WOOD AND MAKE YOURSELF A LARGE RAFT WITH AN UPPER DECK THAT IT MAY CARRY YOU SAFELY OVER THE SEA I WILL PUT BREAD WINE AND WATER ON BOARD TO SAVE YOU FROM STARVING I WILL ALSO GIVE YOU CLOTHES
THE OTHERS EACH FROM HIS OWN SEAT MADE A DRINK OFFERING TO THE BLESSED GODS THAT LIVE IN HEAVEN
THAT WAS OWING FROM THE WHOLE PEOPLE FOR THE MESSENIANS HAD CARRIED OFF THREE HUNDRED SHEEP FROM ITHACA AND HAD SAILED AWAY WITH THEM AND WITH THEIR SHEPHERDS IN QUEST OF THESE ULYSSES TOOK A LONG JOURNEY WHILE STILL QUITE YOUNG
THEN TELEMACHUS SPOKE GREAT HEAVENS HE EXCLAIMED JOVE MUST HAVE ROBBED ME OF MY SENSES HERE IS MY DEAR AND EXCELLENT MOTHER SAYING SHE WILL QUIT THIS HOUSE AND MARRY AGAIN
I APPEAL MORE ESPECIALLY TO EURYMACHUS AND TO ANTINOUS WHO HAS JUST SPOKEN WITH SO MUCH REASON CEASE SHOOTING FOR THE PRESENT AND LEAVE THE MATTER TO THE GODS BUT IN THE MORNING
THEY SHOWED NO DISRESPECT TO TELEMACHUS FOR HE HAS ONLY LATELY GROWN AND HIS MOTHER NEVER PERMITTED HIM TO GIVE ORDERS TO THE FEMALE SERVANTS BUT LET ME GO UPSTAIRS AND TELL YOUR WIFE ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED
AND WHEN HER TEARS HAD RELIEVED HER SHE WENT TO THE CLOISTER WHERE THE SUITORS WERE CARRYING THE BOW AND THE QUIVER WITH THE MANY DEADLY ARROWS THAT WERE INSIDE IT ALONG WITH HER CAME HER MAIDENS
I WILL YOKE MY HORSES AND WILL CONDUCT YOU MYSELF THROUGH ALL OUR PRINCIPAL CITIES NO ONE WILL SEND US AWAY EMPTY HANDED EVERY ONE WILL GIVE US SOMETHING A BRONZE TRIPOD A COUPLE OF MULES OR A GOLD CUP
HE IS TO BE CONVOYED NEITHER BY GODS NOR MEN BUT AFTER A PERILOUS VOYAGE OF TWENTY DAYS UPON A RAFT
IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SOUTH NORTH EAST AND WEST WINDS WERE ALL PLAYING BATTLEDORE AND SHUTTLECOCK WITH IT AT ONCE
SOME ONE OF US IS EVEN NOW HOPING AND PRAYING THAT HE MAY MARRY PENELOPE BUT WHEN HE HAS SEEN THIS BOW AND TRIED IT LET HIM WOO AND MAKE BRIDAL OFFERINGS TO SOME OTHER WOMAN AND LET PENELOPE
I WILL NOW PRESENT YOU WITH THE FINEST AND MOST PRECIOUS PIECE OF PLATE IN ALL MY HOUSE IT IS A MIXING BOWL OF PURE SILVER EXCEPT THE RIM WHICH IS INLAID WITH GOLD AND IT IS THE WORK OF VULCAN
WHERE DIOCLES LIVED WHO WAS SON OF ORTILOCHUS THE SON OF ALPHEUS THERE THEY PASSED THE NIGHT AND WERE TREATED HOSPITABLY WHEN THE CHILD OF MORNING ROSY FINGERED DAWN APPEARED THEY AGAIN YOKED THEIR HORSES AND THEIR PLACES IN THE CHARIOT
BUT I CAN FIND NO LANDING PLACE FOR THE COAST IS ROCKY AND SURF BEATEN THE ROCKS ARE SMOOTH AND RISE SHEER FROM THE SEA WITH DEEP WATER CLOSE UNDER THEM SO THAT I CANNOT CLIMB OUT FOR WANT OF FOOT HOLD
AND WILL SEND YOU A FAIR WIND TO TAKE YOU HOME IF THE GODS IN HEAVEN SO WILL IT FOR THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT THESE THINGS AND CAN SETTLE THEM BETTER THAN I CAN ULYSSES SHUDDERED AS HE HEARD HER NOW GODDESS HE ANSWERED
THEY BENT HIS HANDS AND FEET WELL BEHIND HIS BACK
BRING ME SULPHUR WHICH CLEANSES ALL POLLUTION AND FETCH FIRE ALSO THAT I MAY BURN IT AND PURIFY THE CLOISTERS GO MOREOVER AND TELL PENELOPE TO COME HERE WITH HER ATTENDANTS
AND TRAVELLED THE WHOLE DAY LONG TILL THE SUN SET AND DARKNESS WAS OVER ALL THE LAND
THIS IS WHAT WILL BE SAID AND IT WILL BE A SCANDAL AGAINST US EURYMACHUS PENELOPE ANSWERED PEOPLE WHO PERSIST IN EATING UP THE ESTATE OF A GREAT CHIEFTAIN
I DO NOT THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I HAVE LET YOU OFF TOO LIGHTLY ON THIS HE LASHED HIS HORSES
AND NOW HE IS CLOSE TO THE LAND OF THE PHAEACIANS WHERE IT IS DECREED THAT HE SHALL ESCAPE FROM THE CALAMITIES THAT HAVE BEFALLEN HIM STILL HE SHALL HAVE PLENTY OF HARDSHIP YET BEFORE HE HAS DONE WITH IT
THAT THE SON OF SCHEMING SATURN HAD SENT HIM
BUT KING NEPTUNE WHO WAS RETURNING FROM THE ETHIOPIANS CAUGHT SIGHT OF ULYSSES A LONG WAY OFF FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF THE SOLYMI HE COULD SEE HIM SAILING UPON THE SEA AND IT MADE HIM VERY ANGRY
EVEN SO DID ULYSSES AND HIS MEN FALL UPON THE SUITORS AND SMITE THEM ON EVERY SIDE THEY MADE A HORRIBLE GROANING AS THEIR BRAINS WERE BEING BATTERED IN AND THE GROUND SEETHED WITH THEIR BLOOD
BUT AT LAST HE GOT HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER AND SPAT OUT THE BITTER BRINE THAT WAS RUNNING DOWN HIS FACE IN STREAMS IN SPITE OF ALL THIS HOWEVER
SO THAT ALL HIS CREW WERE DROWNED WHILE HE HIMSELF WAS DRIVEN BY WIND AND WAVES ON TO MY ISLAND I GOT FOND OF HIM AND CHERISHED HIM AND HAD SET MY HEART ON MAKING HIM IMMORTAL SO THAT HE SHOULD NEVER GROW OLD ALL HIS DAYS
FOR THE FOOT WHICH YOU GAVE ULYSSES WHEN HE WAS BEGGING ABOUT IN HIS OWN HOUSE THUS SPOKE THE STOCKMAN AND ULYSSES STRUCK THE SON OF DAMASTOR WITH A SPEAR IN CLOSE FIGHT
THAT THEY MIGHT MAKE A DRINK OFFERING BEFORE THEY SET OUT HE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE HORSES AND PLEDGED THEM SAYING FAREWELL TO BOTH OF YOU SEE THAT YOU TELL NESTOR HOW I HAVE TREATED YOU
OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE STILL FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES THEY WERE BY FAR THE MOST VALIANT FOR THE OTHERS HAD ALREADY FALLEN UNDER THE ARROWS OF ULYSSES
LET ME TELL YOU ALSO OF ANOTHER MATTER WHICH YOU HAD BETTER ATTEND TO
THEY CARRIED THE DEAD BODIES OUT AND PROPPED THEM UP AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN THE GATEHOUSE ULYSSES ORDERED THEM ABOUT AND MADE THEM DO THEIR WORK QUICKLY SO THEY HAD TO CARRY THE BODIES OUT
I TOO MY SON SAID SHE HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU AS A KEEPSAKE FROM THE HAND OF HELEN IT IS FOR YOUR BRIDE TO WEAR UPON HER WEDDING DAY TILL THEN GET YOUR DEAR MOTHER TO KEEP IT FOR YOU
I WISH I WERE AS CERTAIN OF FINDING ULYSSES RETURNED WHEN I GET BACK TO ITHACA THAT I MIGHT TELL HIM OF THE VERY GREAT KINDNESS YOU HAVE SHOWN ME AND OF THE MANY BEAUTIFUL PRESENTS I AM TAKING WITH ME
WHEN HE HAD TAKEN AIM HE LET FLY AND HIS ARROW PIERCED EVERY ONE OF THE HANDLE HOLES OF THE AXES FROM THE FIRST ONWARDS TILL IT HAD GONE RIGHT THROUGH THEM AND INTO THE OUTER COURTYARD THEN HE SAID TO TELEMACHUS
MY FRIENDS HE WILL SOON HAVE TO LEAVE OFF FOR MENTOR HAS GONE AWAY AFTER HAVING DONE NOTHING FOR HIM BUT BRAG THEY ARE STANDING AT THE DOORS UNSUPPORTED DO NOT AIM AT HIM ALL AT ONCE
I GRIEVE THAT I SHALL HAVE TO FORGO THE MARRIAGE BUT I DO NOT CARE NEARLY SO MUCH ABOUT THIS FOR THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER WOMEN IN ITHACA AND ELSEWHERE WHAT I FEEL MOST IS THE FACT OF OUR BEING SO INFERIOR TO ULYSSES IN STRENGTH
WERE SO SHORTLY ABOUT TO TASTE WERE ALL INSIDE THE QUIVER HE LAID IT ON THE CENTRE PIECE OF THE BOW AND DREW THE NOTCH OF THE ARROW
WHO WAS ABOUT TO TAKE UP A TWO HANDLED GOLD CUP TO DRINK HIS WINE AND ALREADY HAD IT IN HIS HANDS HE HAD NO THOUGHT OF DEATH WHO AMONGST ALL THE REVELLERS WOULD THINK THAT ONE MAN HOWEVER BRAVE
YOU SHALL SEE NO OTHER CONTEST YOU ARE A DOOMED MAN HE WHOM YOU HAVE SLAIN WAS THE FOREMOST YOUTH IN ITHACA AND THE VULTURES SHALL DEVOUR YOU FOR HAVING KILLED HIM
THERE IS NOT A MAN OF US ALL WHO IS SUCH ANOTHER AS ULYSSES FOR I HAVE SEEN HIM AND REMEMBER HIM THOUGH I WAS THEN ONLY A CHILD
THE REST APPROVED HIS WORDS AND THEREON MEN SERVANTS POURED WATER OVER THE HANDS OF THE GUESTS WHILE PAGES FILLED THE MIXING BOWLS WITH WINE AND WATER AND HANDED IT ROUND AFTER GIVING EVERY MAN HIS DRINK OFFERING
THUS DID HE SPEAK AND THEY ALL HELD THEIR PEACE THROUGHOUT THE COVERED CLOISTER ENTHRALLED BY THE CHARM OF HIS STORY TILL PRESENTLY ALCINOUS BEGAN TO SPEAK ULYSSES SAID HE
WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS THEY WERE AFRAID AND GOT READY THE BULLS
BUT NOW THEY HAVE BROUGHT HIM IN A SHIP FAST ASLEEP AND HAVE LANDED HIM IN ITHACA AFTER LOADING HIM WITH MORE MAGNIFICENT PRESENTS OF BRONZE GOLD AND RAIMENT THAN HE WOULD EVER HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM TROY
BENEATH WHICH HE HAD HIDDEN BY COVERING HIMSELF UP WITH A FRESHLY FLAYED HEIFER'S HIDE SO HE THREW OFF THE HIDE WENT UP TO TELEMACHUS AND LAID HOLD OF HIS KNEES HERE I AM MY DEAR SIR SAID HE
AND TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE CHARIOT THEY DROVE OUT THROUGH THE INNER GATEWAY AND UNDER THE ECHOING GATEHOUSE OF THE OUTER COURT
FOR THERE IS NOT ONE OF HIS SUBJECTS BUT HAS FORGOTTEN ULYSSES WHO RULED THEM AS THOUGH HE WERE THEIR FATHER THERE HE IS LYING IN GREAT PAIN IN AN ISLAND WHERE DWELLS THE NYMPH CALYPSO
TILL THEY ARE QUITE DEAD AND HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT LOVE AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY USED TO LIE IN SECRET WITH THE SUITORS ON THIS THE WOMEN CAME DOWN IN A BODY WEEPING AND WAILING BITTERLY FIRST
AND NOW YOU ARE ANGRY WITH ME TOO BECAUSE I HAVE A MAN HERE I FOUND THE POOR CREATURE SITTING ALL ALONE ASTRIDE OF A KEEL FOR JOVE HAD STRUCK HIS SHIP WITH LIGHTNING AND SUNK IT IN MID OCEAN
AND ADMIRED THEM ALL AS HE DID SO
AS HE SPOKE A SEA BROKE OVER HIM WITH SUCH TERRIFIC FURY THAT THE RAFT REELED AGAIN AND HE WAS CARRIED OVERBOARD A LONG WAY OFF
BUT THE GODS DELIVER HIM FROM EVIL SO WAS ULYSSES THANKFUL WHEN HE AGAIN SAW LAND AND TREES AND SWAM ON WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH THAT HE MIGHT ONCE MORE SET FOOT UPON DRY GROUND
THESE SUITORS ARE A FEEBLE FOLK THEY ARE PAYING COURT TO THE WIFE OF A BRAVE MAN WHOSE BOW NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO STRING AND YET A BEGGARLY TRAMP WHO CAME TO THE HOUSE STRUNG IT AT ONCE AND SENT AN ARROW THROUGH THE IRON
BOUND INO'S VEIL UNDER HIS ARMS AND PLUNGED INTO THE SEA MEANING TO SWIM ON SHORE KING NEPTUNE WATCHED HIM AS HE DID SO AND WAGGED HIS HEAD MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND SAYING THERE NOW SWIM UP AND DOWN AS YOU BEST CAN
THEN SHE WENT BACK TO OLYMPUS
THEN THEY WENT TO THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS TO GET DINNER AND HE SACRIFICED A BULL FOR THEM IN HONOUR OF JOVE WHO IS THE LORD OF ALL THEY SET THE STEAKS TO GRILL AND MADE AN EXCELLENT DINNER
CALYPSO SET MEAT AND DRINK BEFORE HIM OF THE FOOD THAT MORTALS EAT BUT HER MAIDS BROUGHT AMBROSIA AND NECTAR FOR HERSELF AND THEY LAID THEIR HANDS ON THE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE BEFORE THEM
COME ON EACH OF YOU IN HIS TURN
AND IN THE END HE DEEMED IT BEST TO TURN HIS HORSES TOWARDS THE SHIP
THE PRECIPICES AND THE GOODLY TREES APPEARED ALL CHANGED AS HE STARTED UP AND LOOKED UPON HIS NATIVE LAND SO HE SMOTE HIS THIGHS WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HANDS AND CRIED ALOUD DESPAIRINGLY ALAS
TELEMACHUS SAYS YOU ARE TO CLOSE THE DOORS OF THE WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IF THEY HEAR ANY GROANING OR UPROAR AS OF MEN FIGHTING ABOUT THE HOUSE THEY ARE NOT TO COME OUT BUT ARE TO KEEP QUIET AND STAY WHERE THEY ARE AT THEIR WORK
IF THEY HEAR ANY GROANING OR UPROAR AS OF MEN FIGHTING ABOUT THE HOUSE THEY MUST NOT COME OUT THEY MUST KEEP QUIET AND STAY WHERE THEY ARE AT THEIR WORK AND I CHARGE YOU
AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HIS KEEN BLADE OF BRONZE SHARPENED ON BOTH SIDES AND WITH A LOUD CRY SPRANG TOWARDS ULYSSES BUT ULYSSES INSTANTLY SHOT AN ARROW INTO HIS BREAST THAT CAUGHT HIM BY THE NIPPLE AND FIXED ITSELF IN HIS LIVER
HAVE MERCY UPON ME O KING FOR I DECLARE MYSELF YOUR SUPPLIANT THEN THE GOD STAID HIS STREAM AND STILLED THE WAVES MAKING ALL CALM BEFORE HIM AND BRINGING HIM SAFELY INTO THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER HERE
THAT WE CANNOT STRING HIS BOW THIS WILL DISGRACE US IN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO ARE YET UNBORN IT SHALL NOT BE SO EURYMACHUS SAID ANTINOUS AND YOU KNOW IT YOURSELF
THEN WHEN THEY HAD MADE THEIR OFFERINGS AND HAD DRUNK EACH AS MUCH AS HE DESIRED ULYSSES CRAFTILY SAID SUITORS OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS QUEEN LISTEN THAT I MAY SPEAK EVEN AS I AM MINDED
ON LATE SETTING BOOTES AND ON THE BEAR WHICH MEN ALSO CALL THE WAIN AND WHICH TURNS ROUND AND ROUND WHERE IT IS FACING ORION AND ALONE NEVER DIPPING INTO THE STREAM OF OCEANUS FOR CALYPSO HAD TOLD HIM TO KEEP THIS TO HIS LEFT
I SHALL DIE WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT AND SHALL HAVE GOT NO THANKS FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT I DID ULYSSES LOOKED STERNLY AT HIM AND ANSWERED IF YOU WERE THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST YOU MUST HAVE PRAYED MANY A TIME
WHO ARE NEAR OF KIN TO THE GODS AND WILL HONOUR HIM AS THOUGH HE WERE ONE OF OURSELVES THEY WILL SEND HIM IN A SHIP TO HIS OWN COUNTRY AND WILL GIVE HIM MORE BRONZE AND GOLD AND RAIMENT THAN HE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT BACK FROM TROY
MY FRIENDS THIS MAN WILL GIVE US NO QUARTER
OR WAKES THEM JUST AS HE PLEASES
AND CALYPSO WENT OUT TO LOOK FOR ULYSSES FOR SHE HAD HEARD JOVE'S MESSAGE SHE FOUND HIM SITTING UPON THE BEACH WITH HIS EYES EVER FILLED WITH TEARS AND DYING OF SHEER HOME SICKNESS
AS REGARDS MORTALS HOWEVER IF ANY OF THEM IS INDULGING IN INSOLENCE AND TREATING YOU DISRESPECTFULLY IT WILL ALWAYS REST WITH YOURSELF TO DEAL WITH HIM AS YOU MAY THINK PROPER SO DO JUST AS YOU PLEASE
BUT THE SWINEHERD SAW HIM AND SAID TO ULYSSES WHO WAS BESIDE HIM ULYSSES
THEREON HE FLOATED ABOUT FOR TWO NIGHTS AND TWO DAYS IN THE WATER WITH A HEAVY SWELL ON THE SEA AND DEATH STARING HIM IN THE FACE BUT WHEN THE THIRD DAY BROKE THE WIND FELL AND THERE WAS A DEAD CALM WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A BREATH OF AIR STIRRING
NOT EVEN A WELL FOUND SHIP WITH A FAIR WIND COULD VENTURE ON SUCH A DISTANT VOYAGE NOTHING THAT YOU CAN SAY OR DO SHALL MAKE ME GO ON BOARD A RAFT UNLESS YOU FIRST SOLEMNLY SWEAR
AND HERE HE THOUGHT WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE FOR THERE WERE NO ROCKS AND IT AFFORDED SHELTER FROM THE WIND HE FELT THAT THERE WAS A CURRENT SO HE PRAYED INWARDLY AND SAID HEAR ME O KING WHOEVER YOU MAY BE
BUT THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT AND ALCINOUS SAID I REMEMBER NOW THE OLD PROPHECY OF MY FATHER HE SAID THAT NEPTUNE WOULD BE ANGRY WITH US FOR TAKING EVERY ONE SO SAFELY OVER THE SEA AND WOULD ONE DAY WRECK A PHAEACIAN SHIP
TILL THE HEAT OF THE SUN MAKES AN END OF THEM EVEN SO WERE THE SUITORS LYING ALL HUDDLED UP ONE AGAINST THE OTHER THEN ULYSSES SAID TO TELEMACHUS
LOOKING FEARFULLY ROUND AND STILL EXPECTING THAT THEY WOULD BE KILLED THEN ULYSSES SEARCHED THE WHOLE COURT CAREFULLY OVER TO SEE IF ANYONE HAD MANAGED TO HIDE HIMSELF AND WAS STILL LIVING
FOR WHEN I CAME AWAY I LEFT MY PROPERTY WITHOUT PROTECTION AND FEAR THAT WHILE LOOKING FOR MY FATHER I SHALL COME TO RUIN MYSELF OR FIND THAT SOMETHING VALUABLE HAS BEEN STOLEN DURING MY ABSENCE
FOR SHE SAW THAT A GREAT DEED HAD BEEN DONE BUT ULYSSES CHECKED HER OLD WOMAN SAID HE REJOICE IN SILENCE RESTRAIN YOURSELF AND DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISE ABOUT IT IT IS AN UNHOLY THING
I SHOULD ADVISE YOU TO GO TO THE OFFICES OF THE COMPANY IN COLEMAN STREET AND TRY TO MAKE SOME TERMS THERE BUT I FEAR I FEAR
HE HAD SEEN LOPEZ MORE THAN ONCE AND HAD ALSO SEEN MISTER HARTLEPOD MISTER HARTLEPOD HAD SIMPLY TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO REGISTER THE SHARES
HE WOULD HAVE DOUBLED HIS OFFER COULD HE THEREBY HAVE SECURED THE ANNIHILATION OF LOPEZ I WILL RAISE IT IF HE WILL GO WITHOUT HIS WIFE
THE YOUNG MAN MAY BECOME LORD CHANCELLOR OR AT ANY RATE EARN HIS BREAD COMFORTABLY AS A COUNTY COURT JUDGE BUT THE GIRL CAN LOOK FORWARD TO LITTLE ELSE THAN THE CHANCE OF HAVING A GOOD MAN FOR HER HUSBAND A GOOD MAN
TO LIVE OUT OF ENGLAND YES AT A PLACE THEY CALL I FORGET WHAT THEY CALL IT BUT I HEARD IT GUATEMALA
AND YOU OUGHT TO FEEL THAT AS I HAVE HAD A LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE WORLD MY JUDGMENT ABOUT A YOUNG MAN MIGHT BE TRUSTED THAT WAS A STATEMENT WHICH MISS WHARTON WAS NOT PREPARED TO ADMIT
IF ANYBODY HAD EVER COME TO ME AND SAID MY HUSBAND HAD ROBBED HIM I'D NEVER HAVE STOPPED TILL I KNEW THE TRUTH OF IT IF ANY WOMAN HAD EVER SAID TO ME
AND FURTHER EDUCATION QUESTIONS ALL MEN KNEW WHO KNEW ANYTHING BUT FOR THE MOMENT FOR THE MONTH EVEN PERHAPS FOR THE SESSION THERE WAS TO BE PEACE WITH FULL LATITUDE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ROUTINE DUTIES THERE WAS SO TO SAY NO OPPOSITION
SHE KNOWS LESS OF IT ALL THAN YOU DO IT IS MY FAULT SAID EMILY BURSTING OUT INTO SELF REPROACH MY FAULT THAT I MARRIED HIM
IN REGARD TO MAGNIFICENCE AND HOSPITALITY SHE SAID NOTHING OF ANY EXTRAORDINARY EXPENDITURE OF MONEY BUT SHE SET HERSELF TO WORK AFTER HER OWN FASHION MAKING TO HIM SUGGESTIONS AS TO DINNERS AND EVENING RECEPTIONS
AT THE FIRST BLUSH OF THE MATTER THE ARRANGEMENT TOOK THE FORM OF A GRACIOUS TENDER FROM THEMSELVES TO A STATESMAN CALLED UPON TO ACT IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY WERE THANKED ACCORDINGLY BY THE DUKE WITH SOMETHING OF REAL CORDIAL GRATITUDE
INDEED THEN MISSUS LOPEZ I AM VERY FAR FROM WELL NO POOR WOMAN WHO IS THE MOTHER OF FIVE CHILDREN WAS EVER FARTHER
AND YOUR HUSBAND THINKS NO END OF HIMSELF AND WE'RE POOR PEOPLE SO IT DON'T MATTER WHETHER WE'RE ROBBED AND RUINED OR NOT THAT'S ABOUT IT IF I HAD ANYTHING
I THINK YOU'LL HAVE TO RAISE YOUR OFFER MISTER WALKER HAD SAID TO MISTER WHARTON THAT WAS ALL VERY WELL MISTER WHARTON WAS WILLING ENOUGH TO RAISE HIS OFFER
THAT HE DID LOVE THE GIRL AS WELL PERHAPS AS HE WAS CAPABLE OF LOVING ANY ONE BUT HE HAD FOUND OUT MANY PARTICULARS AS TO MISTER WHARTON'S MONEY BEFORE HE HAD ALLOWED HIMSELF TO LOVE HER AS SOON AS MISSUS ROBY HAD GATHERED UP HER KNITTING
BUT I DID HAVE SOME PLEASURE IN PROPOSING IT TO HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD PLEASE YOU IT DOES PLEASE ME AND I WON'T BE CROSS ANY MORE AND THE DUCHESS OF
AND THE AMOUNT OF SALARY WHICH WAS TO BE ATTACHED TO IT WHETHER HE WILL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU I CANNOT SAY I SHOULD THINK NOT UNLESS HE BE FORCED
I AM SURE YOU BELIEVE ME WHEN I PROMISE NOT TO SEE HIM WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION I DO BELIEVE YOU OF COURSE I BELIEVE YOU BUT IF I DO THAT FOR YOU PAPA I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO BE VERY SURE ON MY ACCOUNT
ON BEHALF OF LOPEZ AS SOON AS THE MONEY WAS PAID LOPEZ HAD BEEN ALMOST INSOLENT IN HIS BEARING DID MISTER WHARTON THINK HE ASKED
AND AT FIRST IT SEEMED THAT ONE SPECIAL BENCH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WOULD REMAIN UNOCCUPIED BUT AFTER A DAY OR TWO ON ONE OF WHICH MISTER DAUBENY HAD BEEN SEEN SITTING JUST BELOW THE GANGWAY THAT GENTLEMAN RETURNED TO THE PLACE USUALLY HELD BY THE PRIME MINISTER'S RIVAL
IF HE DID NOT MEAN YOU TO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF WHY DIDN'T HE KEEP A CLOSER LOOK OUT I HAVEN'T CHOSEN ANY ONE AUNT HARRIET WELL TO SPEAK FAIRLY I THOUGHT YOU HAD AND I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST YOUR CHOICE
AND LET THAT BE AN END OF IT I LITTLE KNEW WHAT A WORLD OF TORMENT I WAS PREPARING FOR MYSELF
DO YOU THINK THAT HE WILL NOT GO I FEEL THAT I KNOW NOTHING PAPA YOU MUST NOT LET HIM STAY HERE ALWAYS YOU KNOW AND WHAT WILL BECOME OF YOU
HAD PROMISED THAT SHE WOULD SLAVE FOR HIM IF SLAVERY WERE NECESSARY THEN SHE HAD MADE HER REQUEST HAD BEEN REFUSED AND WAS NOW MOODY THE DUCHESS OF
THE TIME SHOULD COME HE WOULD BUY HIS DAUGHTER'S RELEASE AT ANY PRICE THAT MIGHT BE DEMANDED MISTER WALKER THE ATTORNEY HAD AS YET BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE NOTHING
WE'RE RUINED MISSUS LOPEZ AND IT'S YOUR HUSBAND HAS DONE IT WHEN WE WERE AT DOVERCOURT I TOLD YOU HOW IT WAS GOING TO BE HIS BUSINESS HAS LEFT HIM
DO YOU THINK THAT I'D SIT AS YOU ARE SITTING I TELL YOU THAT LOPEZ HAS ROBBED US HAS ROBBED US AND TAKEN EVERYTHING WHAT CAN I SAY MISSUS PARKER
IN ONE OF THOSE ANXIOUS CONVERSATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BEFORE THE ATTEMPT WAS MADE THAT LONG AS HE HAD BEEN IN OFFICE HIMSELF HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS THE WAY OF BESTOWING OFFICE TWO GENTLEMEN HAVE BEEN HERE THIS MORNING HE SAID ONE DAY TO THE DUKE OF SAINT BUNGAY
AND WHEN AT THE SAME MOMENT TOGETHER WITH THE CHANGE HE SECURES POWER PATRONAGE AND PAY HOW SHALL THE PUBLIC VOICE ABSOLVE HIM BUT THEN AGAIN MEN WHO HAVE BY THE WORK OF THEIR LIVES GROWN INTO A CERTAIN POSITION IN THE COUNTRY
NOR SPOKEN TO HIM OF YOUR REGARD FOR HIM NEVER NOT A WORD NOR HE TO ME EXCEPT IN SUCH WORDS AS ONE UNDERSTANDS EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOTHING I WISH HE HAD NEVER SEEN YOU IS HE A BAD MAN PAPA
WHEN A MAN SPECULATES AND DOESN'T WIN OF COURSE HE THROWS THE BLAME ON SOME ONE ELSE AND WHEN HE IS TOO MUCH OF A CUR TO COME HIMSELF HE SENDS HIS WIFE
FOR MYSELF I'D HAVE SOONER STAYED OUT AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER BUT DAUBENY SAID THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS BOUND TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL I TOLD THE DUKE FROM THE BEGINNING SAID RATTLER THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT I COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE TO HIM
THEY DO MURDER PEOPLE YOU KNOW SOMETIMES HE'S AN IRISHMAN HIMSELF THAT'S JUST THE REASON WHY THEY SHOULD HE MUST PUT UP WITH THAT OF COURSE I WONDER WHETHER SHE'LL LIKE GOING THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND MONEY WHICH THEY ALWAYS LIKE
HE HAD THE POWER HE KNEW OF PUTTING AN END TO THE THING ALTOGETHER HE HAD ONLY TO SAY RESOLUTELY AND UNCHANGEABLY THAT THE THING SHOULDN'T BE AND IT WOULDN'T BE
THE SERVANT DID NOT KNOW WHAT WOMAN SHE HAD ASKED TO SEE MISSUS LOPEZ AND MISSUS LOPEZ HAD GONE DOWN TO HER
AS THEY WILL DO IF YOU KNEW ME MISSUS PARKER YOU WOULDN'T SPEAK TO ME LIKE THAT KNOW YOU OF COURSE I KNOW YOU YOU'RE A LADY AND YOUR FATHER'S A RICH MAN
MISTER LOPEZ SIR HAS RUINED US ROOT AND BRANCH ROOT AND BRANCH THAT AT ANY RATE IS NOT MY FAULT SAID MISTER WHARTON
AND GIVE HER A WRITTEN ASSURANCE THAT HE WILL NEVER TROUBLE HER AGAIN BUT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS ONE WHICH MISTER WALKER FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO CARRY OUT
SHE HAD A RIGHT TO PLEAD HER CAUSE BEFORE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN AND SHE WAS NOT SLOW TO ASSURE HERSELF EVEN AS THIS INTERVIEW WENT ON THAT HER LOVE FOR THE MAN WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO ENTITLE HER TO ASSURE HER FATHER THAT HER HAPPINESS DEPENDED ON HIS REVERSAL OF THE SENTENCE
WAS AT LAST ASSIGNED TO SIR ORLANDO DROUGHT IT WILL NEVER DO SAID MISTER RATTLER TO MISTER ROBY I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST DROUGHT WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY USEFUL MAN TO YOUR PARTY BUT HE LACKS SOMETHING OF THE POSITION
HE WAS ASTOUNDED NOT SO MUCH BY THE PRETENSIONS AS BY THE UNBLUSHING ASSERTION OF THESE PRETENSIONS IN REFERENCE TO PLACES WHICH HE HAD BEEN INNOCENT ENOUGH TO THINK WERE ALWAYS BESTOWED AT ANY RATE WITHOUT DIRECT APPLICATION HE HAD MEASURED HIMSELF RIGHTLY WHEN HE TOLD THE OLDER DUKE
IT'S A PITY SHE SHOULD NOT REMEMBER HERS IN THE WAY SHE DRESSES SAID THE DUCHESS THIS WAS MARVELLOUS TO HIM THAT HIS WIFE
SOMETIMES DISASTROUS AND ON OCCASIONS EVEN DISGRACEFUL WHEN A MAN PERHAPS THROUGH A LONG POLITICAL LIFE HAS BOUND HIMSELF TO A CERTAIN CODE OF OPINIONS HOW CAN HE CHANGE THAT CODE AT A MOMENT
SO THAT AT THE FIRST PROPOSITION TO FORM A COALITION MINISTRY THE NEWSPAPERS HAD HARDLY KNOWN WHETHER TO ASSIST OR TO OPPOSE THE SCHEME THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN THE MINDS OF ALL THESE EDITORS AND CONTRIBUTORS THE TEACHING OF A TRADITION THAT COALITIONS OF THIS KIND HAVE BEEN GENERALLY FEEBLE
SO I AM TOLD SHE OUGHT TO KNOW HER WAY ABOUT THE PLACE AS I REMEMBER SHE WAS AT THE SAME WORK WHEN I WAS A GIRL OF ELEVEN THAT'S NOT SO VERY LONG AGO CORA SILVERBRIDGE IS OLDER NOW THAN I WAS THEN
BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE LOST YOU BUT WHAT DID MY TELLING MATTER TO HIM HE WAS VERY INDIGNANT AND YET HE IS STILL HERE
INJURY HAD PERHAPS ALREADY BEEN DONE IT MAY BE THAT SOME SLIGHTEST SOIL HAD ALREADY MARRED THE PURE WHITE OF THE GIRL'S NATURAL CHARACTER BUT IF SO THE STAIN WAS AS YET TOO IMPALPABLE TO BE VISIBLE TO ORDINARY EYES
HAVEN'T YOU MISSUS LOPEZ OH DEAR EXCLAIMED THE SOFT HEARTED WOMAN REDUCED AT ONCE TO PITY HOW WAS IT THEN
HE TOOK HIMSELF TO HIS OWN ROOMS BEFORE LOPEZ RETURNED BUT SHE OF COURSE HAD TO BEAR HER HUSBAND'S PRESENCE
NO DOUBT YOUR PAPA WILL HAVE IT OUT WITH YOU JUST NOW SO YOU HAD BETTER MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHAT YOU WILL SAY TO HIM IF YOU REALLY LIKE THE MAN I DON'T SEE WHY YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SO AND STICK TO IT HE HAS MADE A REGULAR OFFER AND GIRLS IN THESE DAYS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE THEIR FATHER'S SLAVES
WHEN HE GOES I MUST GO WITH HIM WHY SHOULD YOU BE SACRIFICED ALSO I WILL TELL HIM THAT HE MUST LEAVE THE HOUSE I AM NOT AFRAID OF HIM PAPA
SO THINGS WENT ON TILL THE END OF FEBRUARY HAD COME AND DURING ALL THIS TIME LOPEZ WAS STILL RESIDENT IN MISTER WHARTON'S HOUSE
IT WILL BE ALL USELESS THEN WE MAY STARVE IT IS NOT HER FAULT SAID MISTER WHARTON POINTING TO HIS DAUGHTER SHE HAS HAD NO HAND IN IT
TO BE TOLD WITHIN THE SAME HALF HOUR BY TWO MEN THAT I HAD MADE PROMISES TO EACH OF THEM INCONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER WHO WERE THE TWO MEN MISTER RATTLER AND MISTER ROBY I AM ASSURED THAT THEY ARE INSEPARABLE SINCE THE WORK WAS BEGUN
YOU'RE RICH INDEED I AM NOT MISSUS PARKER YES YOU ARE YOU'RE LIVING HERE IN A GRAND HOUSE AND YOUR FATHER'S MADE OF MONEY
AND AS TO WHOSE FITNESS AND CLAIMS HE PROFESSED HIMSELF TO BE AS IGNORANT AS THE OFFICE MESSENGER THE OFFERS WERE OF COURSE MADE IN THE USUAL FORM AS THOUGH COMING DIRECT FROM THE QUEEN THROUGH THE PRIME MINISTER BUT THE SELECTIONS WERE IN TRUTH EFFECTED BY THE OLD DUKE IN COUNCIL WITH
FROM BEING WELL THAN I AM IS ANYTHING WRONG WRONG MA'AM EVERYTHING IS WRONG WHEN IS MISTER LOPEZ GOING TO PAY MY HUSBAND
GRADUALLY SHE HAD LEARNED HOW FRIGHTFUL WAS THE THING SHE HAD DONE IN GIVING HERSELF TO A MAN OF WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN NOTHING AND IT WAS NOT ONLY THAT
NOT IN THE CABINET NO NOT IN THE CABINET IT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS USUAL THAT HE SHOULD BE THAT IS PROMOTION AND I AM GLAD POOR PHINEAS I HOPE THEY WON'T MURDER HIM OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
BUT FEELING THAT SOME FURTHER HORROR WAS TO BE TOLD HIM OF HIS SON IN LAW I CAN'T HELP COMING SIR CONTINUED MISSUS PARKER WHERE AM I TO GO IF I DON'T COME
YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL YOU WERE ALWAYS A GOOD GIRL BUT I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO HEAR ME THEN HE STOOD STILL WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS TROWSERS POCKETS LOOKING AT HER
SHE IS NOT AT ANY RATE A FIT COMPANION FOR YOU IT WAS YOU WHO INTRODUCED ME TO HER HOLD YOUR TONGUE ABOUT HER
I WILL OF COURSE I WILL AND HE BEGAN THE PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND HER BUT WHAT WAS THERE TO THINK ABOUT NOTHING THAT SHE HAD SAID ALTERED IN THE LEAST HIS IDEA ABOUT THE MAN
THAT IT WON'T COME WITHIN THE COMPASS OF MY OFFICE TO EFFECT OR EVEN TO PROPOSE ANY RADICAL CHANGE IN HER GRACE'S APPAREL BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT YOU AND I CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE ALL THAT I CAN CERTAINLY SHE MAY BE AN ANTIQUATED EVE FOR ME
THAT HAD BEEN A GREAT QUESTION CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT THE PRIME MINISTER WAS IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS AND WHAT OFFICE SHOULD THE LEADER HOLD MISTER MONK HAD CONSENTED TO TAKE THE EXCHEQUER
IN AMERICA I KNOW SEXTY TOLD ME HE HAS NO BUSINESS TO GO ANYWHERE WHILE HE OWES SEXTY SUCH A LOT OF MONEY HE HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING
A MEANING TO A MAN'S WORDS EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO THAT WHICH ANOTHER TONE WOULD CONVEY OR IF HE DOES LIE IN DOING SO HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE LIES MISTER RATTLER HAD GONE BACK TO HIS OLD OFFICE AT THE TREASURY
OR IF HER TASTES LIE IN THAT DIRECTION A RICH MAN EMILY WHARTON HAD DOUBTLESS THOUGHT ABOUT THESE THINGS AND SHE SINCERELY BELIEVED THAT SHE HAD FOUND THE GOOD MAN IN FERDINAND LOPEZ
PAPA I WISH YOU KNEW HIM BETTER THAN YOU DO I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW HIM BETTER IS NOT THAT PREJUDICE PAPA MY DEAR EMILY SAID MISTER WHARTON STRIVING TO WAX INTO ANGER
YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW CONSTANTLY I CARRY YOU ABOUT WITH ME YOU CARRY A VERY UNNECESSARY BURDEN THEN SHE SAID BUT HE COULD TELL AT ONCE FROM THE ALTERED TONE OF HER VOICE AND FROM THE LIGHT OF HER EYE AS HE GLANCED INTO HER FACE
I'D GIVE YOU ALL THAT I HAD AND HE'S TAKEN TO DRINKING THAT HARD THAT HE'S NEVER RIGHTLY SOBER FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AS SHE TOLD THIS STORY OF HER HUSBAND'S DISGRACE
BUT SHE IS HIS WIFE SIR WHERE AM I TO GO IF NOT TO WHERE HE LIVES AM I TO PUT UP WITH EVERYTHING GONE AND MY POOR HUSBAND
HE IS WHAT WE CALL AN ADVENTURER MARRIAGE MY DEAR IS A MOST SERIOUS THING YES PAPA I KNOW THAT ONE IS BOUND TO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW CAN I GIVE YOU TO A MAN I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT AN ADVENTURER
THERE WAS SO MUCH OF INDECISION IN HER HUSBAND'S MANNER AND APPARENTLY SO LITTLE DONE BY HIM IN REGARD TO PERSONAL PREPARATION THAT SHE COULD HARDLY BRING HERSELF TO FEEL CERTAIN
SHE HAS COME HERE WITH BAD NEWS VERY BAD NEWS INDEED SIR SAID MISSUS PARKER CURTSEYING AGAIN MISTER WHARTON FROWNED NOT AS BEING ANGRY WITH THE WOMAN
MISTER FINN IS TO GO TO IRELAND GO TO IRELAND HOW DO YOU MEAN IT IS LOOKED UPON AS BEING VERY GREAT PROMOTION INDEED I AM TOLD THAT HE IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE LUCKIEST MAN IN ALL THE SCRAMBLE YOU DON'T MEAN AS CHIEF SECRETARY
WHICH SHE WAS RUNNING AND NOW IT SEEMED THAT SHE HAD DESTROYED HER FATHER AS WELL AS HERSELF ALL THAT SHE COULD DO WAS TO BE PERSISTENT IN HER PRAYER
THE WOMAN IN THE DINING ROOM WAS MISSUS PARKER SHE HAD CALLED AT THE HOUSE AT ABOUT HALF PAST FIVE AND EMILY HAD AT ONCE COME DOWN WHEN SUMMONED BY TIDINGS
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY MAN EVER VENTURED TO ASK MISTER MILDMAY TIME HAD DONE MUCH FOR HIM IN CONSOLIDATING HIS AUTHORITY AND PERHAPS THE PRESENT WORLD IS LESS RETICENT IN ITS EAGERNESS THAN IT WAS IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS I DOUBT HOWEVER
DON'T YOU FEEL NO SHAME BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THINGS COMFORTABLE HERE I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL NOTHING TO YOU YOU DON'T CARE THOUGH MY CHILDREN WERE STARVING IN THE GUTTER
ALL THE MONEY HE HAS TOOK FROM HIM HAS HE TAKEN MONEY TAKEN HE HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING HE HAS SHORN MY HUSBAND AS BARE AS A BOARD
HE HAD EXPRESSLY ASKED HER FOR HER SYMPATHY IN THE BUSINESS HE HAD ON HAND THEREBY GOING MUCH BEYOND HIS USUAL COLDNESS OF MANNER
TIME IS UP INTERRUPTED OLD MOTHER NATURE
SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE IN VERY COLD WEATHER HE SLEEPS BUT IF HE HAPPENS TO BE LIVING WHERE THE WEATHER DOES NOT GET VERY COLD HE IS ACTIVE ALL THE YEAR AROUND NOW I GUESS THIS IS ENOUGH ABOUT THE SQUIRREL FAMILY
HE LIKES TO GET INTO OLD BUILDINGS DOES HE HAVE MANY ENEMIES ASKED HAPPY JACK THE SAME ENEMIES THE REST OF YOU HAVE REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE BUT THE ONE HE HAS MOST REASON TO FEAR
UNC POKED HIS HEAD A LITTLE FARTHER OUT AND PUT HIS HAND BEHIND HIS EAR AS IF HE WERE A LITTLE HARD OF HEARING
HE GETS INTO SO MUCH MISCHIEF IN THE GRAIN FIELDS AND IN THE ORCHARDS THAT HE IS QUITE AS MUCH DISLIKED AS IS JACK RABBIT THIS PARTICULAR MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IS QUITE AS MUCH AT HOME AMONG ROCKS AND TREE ROOTS AS IN OPEN GROUND
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN JOHNNY CHUCK CRIED PETER OLD MOTHER NATURE LAUGHED SO I HAVE SAID SHE THAT WILL NEVER DO NEVER IN THE WORLD
THOUGH SQUEAKY VOICE HE HUNTS AND KILLS JUST FOR THE LOVE OF IT AND NO ONE NO MATTER HOW BIG HE IS CAN DO ANYTHING MORE AWFUL THAN THAT
ON MY WAY HERE I SAW UNC BILLY AND IT POPPED INTO MY HEAD RIGHT AWAY THAT HE WAS ONE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT AND MUST BE THE ONE BUT IF HE EATS FLESH
THE SMALLEST OF THE SPINY POCKET MICE IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF NIBBLER THE HOUSE MOUSE AND THE LARGEST IS TWICE AS BIG THEY ARE MORE SLENDER THAN THEIR SILKY COUSINS
THERE WERE TWELVE YOUNGSTERS AND THEY WERE EXACTLY LIKE THEIR PARENTS ONLY SMALL THEY WERE CLINGING ALL OVER OL MISSUS POSSUM SOME WERE ON HER BACK SOME WERE CLINGING TO HER SIDES
I COULDN'T GET CATS OUT OF MY MIND ALL DAY YESTERDAY BEGAN JUMPER BLACK PUSSY DOESN'T WORRY ME BUT I MUST CONFESS THAT IF THERE IS ANY ONE I FEAR IT IS YOWLER THE BOB CAT JUST THINKING ABOUT HIM MAKE ME NERVOUS THE MORE I TRIED NOT TO THINK ABOUT HIM
HE HAS SOME LARGER COUSINS ONE OF THEM BEING A LITTLE BIGGER THAN NIBBLER THE HOUSE MOUSE NEIGHBORS AND CLOSE RELATIVES ARE THE SPINY POCKET MICE DO THEY
AND CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL AND PRICKLY PORKY THE PORCUPINE WHO WERE SITTING IN TREES KEPT THEIR PLACES YOU SEE THEY FELT QUITE SAFE AS SOON AS ALL THOSE WHO HAD RUN HAD REACHED PLACES OF SAFETY
WHO OF YOU HAS SEEN TIMMY THE FLYING SQUIRREL LATELY I HAVEN'T SAID PETER RABBIT I HAVEN'T SAID STRIPED CHIPMUNK I HAVEN'T SAID HAPPY JACK I HAVEN'T SAID CHATTERER
YOU'VE SEEN A BIRD AFTER FLAPPING ITS WINGS TO GET GOING SAIL ALONG WITH THEM OUTSTRETCHED AND MOTIONLESS TIMMY DOES THE SAME THING ONLY HE GETS GOING BY JUMPING
AND A COUPLE WERE IN THE BIG POCKET WHERE THEY HAD SPENT THEIR BABYHOOD WE ALL DONE THOUGHT WE'D COME TO SCHOOL EXPLAINED UNC BILLY WITH A GRIN
HE LOOKED A GREAT DEAL AS THOUGH HE MIGHT BE A GIANT RAT BUT IF UNC BILLY WAS A FUNNY LOOKING FELLOW OL MISSUS POSSUM WAS EVEN MORE FUNNY LOOKING
AND YOU SAW HIM IN WINTER HE CHANGES HIS COAT ACCORDING TO SEASON JUST AS YOU DO YOURSELF JUMPER IN WINTER HE IS TRAPPED FOR HIS FUR
DOES HE EAT NUTS LIKE HIS COUSINS ASKED PETER RABBIT HE CERTAINLY DOES REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE ALSO HE EATS GRUBS AND INSECTS HE DEARLY LOVES A FAT BEETLE
HE IS HOT BLOODED QUICK TEMPERED AND FEARLESS EVEN WHEN CORNERED BY AN ENEMY AGAINST WHOM HE HAS NO CHANCE HE WILL FIGHT TO THE LAST GASP
HIS FEET ARE VERY DARK BROWN ALMOST BLACK HIS HEAD IS DARK BROWN WITH LIGHT GRAY ON HIS CHEEKS BENEATH HE IS REDDISH ORANGE INCLUDING HIS THROAT HIS TAIL IS SHORT FOR A MEMBER OF THE SQUIRREL FAMILY
WHILE HIS COUSINS OF THE TREES HAVE NO POCKETS AT ALL
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN MICE WITH POCKETS AND OTHERS
I CAN CLIMB IF I HAVE TO RETORTED JOHNNY CHUCK INDIGNANTLY I'VE CLIMBED UP BUSHES AND LOW TREES LOTS OF TIMES AND IF I CAN GET A GOOD RUN FIRST I CAN CLIMB UP THE STRAIGHT TRUNK OF A TREE WITH ROUGH BARK TO THE FIRST BRANCHES IF THEY ARE NOT TOO FAR ABOVE GROUND
LIKE A SNAKE ON LEGS DECLARED STRIPED CHIPMUNK ANYWAY THAT IS WHAT HE MADE ME THINK OF BECAUSE HIS BODY WAS SO LONG AND SLIM AND HE TWISTED AND TURNED SO EASILY
THE LIFE HAD BEEN SCARED RIGHT OUT OF UNC BILLY I GUESS FARMER BROWN'S BOY THOUGHT SO TOO HE PICKED UNC BILLY UP BY THE TAIL AND LOOKED HIM ALL OVER AND SAID YOU POOR LITTLE THING
OF COURSE THERE COULDN'T BE A SCHOOL IN THE GREEN FOREST WITHOUT NEWS OF IT SPREADING VERY FAST NEWS TRAVELS QUICKLY THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST AND OVER THE GREEN MEADOWS
IT WASN'T FOR YOUR BENEFIT THAT I SENT WORD FOR YOU TO BE HERE THIS MORNING IT WAS FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS NOW SIT UP SO THAT ALL CAN GET A GOOD LOOK AT YOU
NOT LATELY SAID HE AH DONE GOT A DREADFUL SCARE THE LAST TIME AH WAS UP THERE
SHE SEEMED TO HAVE HEADS AND TAILS ALL OVER HER YOU SEE SHE HAD BROUGHT ALONG HER FAMILY AND OL MISSUS POSSUM IS ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN LARGE FAMILIES
AND FOLLOWING EVERY TWIST AND TURN I HAD MADE
OUTSIDE OF THAT HE HASN'T A FRIEND IN THE WORLD NOT ONE HASN'T HE ANY ENEMIES ASKED PETER RABBIT OH YES REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE
AND OTHER SOFT THINGS STOLEN FROM THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE HOUSE IN GETTING THIS MATERIAL THEY OFTEN DO GREAT DAMAGE IF THEY ARE LIVING IN A BARN THEY MAKE THEIR NEST OF HAY
YOU MEAN TEENY WEENY THE SHREW REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE SMILING AT HAPPY JACK HE ISN'T A MOUSE HE ISN'T EVEN A RODENT I'LL TRY TO HAVE HIM HERE TO MORROW MORNING
INQUIRED STRIPED CHIPMUNK BECAUSE WHEN THE REST OF YOU SQUIRRELS ARE OUT AND ABOUT HE IS CURLED UP IN A LITTLE BALL IN HIS NEST FAST ASLEEP TIMMY LIKES THE NIGHT ESPECIALLY THE EARLY EVENING
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU UNC BILLY DIDN'T SO MUCH AS WINK AN EYE FARMER BROWN'S BOY WENT OFF UP THE PATH CARRYING UNC BILLY BY THE TAIL BY AND BY HE LAID UNC BILLY DOWN
ONE SHOULD CALL THEM THIS IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND BELONG TO THE MARMOT BRANCH OF THE SQUIRREL FAMILY AND WHEREVER FOUND THEY LOOK MUCH ALIKE AS YOU WILL NOTICE JOHNNY CHUCK'S COAT IS BROWNISH YELLOW
THE VERY NICEST KIND OF A BED FOR THE BABIES NO ONE HAS A NEATER HOME THAN THE HARVEST MOUSE HE IS QUITE AS MUCH AT HOME IN BUSHES AND LOW TREES AS HAPPY JACK SQUIRREL IS IN BIGGER TREES
HE HADN'T MADE A SOUND NOT A LEAF RUSTLED UNDER HIS BIG FEET RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT OPEN PLACE WHERE THE MOONLIGHT WAS BRIGHTEST HE STOPPED TO LISTEN AND I SIMPLY HELD MY BREATH TELL US HOW HE LOOKED PROMPTED OLD MOTHER NATURE
BOTH HAVE THE SAME GENERAL HABITS AND THESE ARE MUCH LIKE THE HABITS OF DANNY MEADOW MOUSE THEY MAKE SHORT BURROWS IN THE GROUND LEADING TO SNUG WARM NESTS OF GRASS AND MOSS IN WINTER
SHADOW IS KNOWN AS THE COMMON WEASEL SHORT TAILED WEASEL BROWN WEASEL BONAPARTE WEASEL AND ERMINE AND IS FOUND ALL OVER THE FORESTED PARTS OF THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY
IN THE FALL I DIG A DEEP BURROW DEEP ENOUGH TO BE BEYOND THE REACH OF JACK FROST AND IN A NICE LITTLE BEDROOM DOWN THERE I SLEEP THE WINTER AWAY I HAVE LITTLE STOREROOMS DOWN THERE TOO IN WHICH I PUT SEEDS BERRIES AND NUTS
BUT THOSE FOLKS DON'T KNOW UNC BILLY HE LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THAT HE CAN'T RUN AS FAST AS SOME OTHERS SO HE HAS LEARNED TO DEPEND ON HIS WITS IN TIME OF DANGER WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DOES I
BUT TIMMY HAS TO CLIMB TO A HIGH PLACE AND THEN COASTS DOWN ON THE AIR I TOLD YOU WHAT WONDERFUL JUMPS JACK RABBIT CAN MAKE BUT IF HE COULD JUMP AS HIGH AND FAR FOR HIS SIZE AS NIMBLEHEELS CAN JUMP FOR HIS SIZE
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR SHADOW AND HIS FAMILY
HAD HE KEPT IT STILL I WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN HIM AT ALL BUT HE WAS TWITCHING IT BACK AND FORTH HE WAS CROUCHED DOWN CLOSE TO THE GROUND WITH ALL FOUR FEET DRAWN CLOSE TOGETHER UNDER HIM THERE HE CROUCHED AND THERE I SAT FOR THE LONGEST TIME
WHO CHANGES THE COLOR OF HIS COAT IN SUMMER HE WEARS BEAUTIFUL SHADES OF REDDISH BROWN AND GRAY BUT IN WINTER HIS COAT IS WHOLLY WHITE HE IS ALSO CALLED THE HUDSON BAY LEMMING DANNY MEADOW MOUSE THINKS HIS TAIL IS SHORT
THE LONGEST JUMP JACK HAS EVER MADE WOULD SEEM NOTHING MORE THAN A HOP BY THE WAY BOTH NIMBLEHEELS AND WHITEFOOT HAVE SMALL POCKETS IN THEIR CHEEKS TELL US WHERE YOU LIVE NIMBLEHEELS
AND ANY SOFT MATERIAL THEY CAN FIND WHILE NIBBLER PREFERS TO LIVE IN OR CLOSE TO THE HOMES OF MEN HE SOMETIMES IS DRIVEN OUT AND THEN TAKES TO THE FIELDS ESPECIALLY IN SUMMER
IS THAT STRIPED CHIPMUNK SLEEPS NEARLY ALL WINTER JUST WAKING UP OCCASIONALLY TO POP HIS HEAD OUT ON A BRIGHT DAY TO SEE HOW THE WEATHER IS A GREAT MANY FOLKS CALL STRIPED CHIPMUNK A GROUND SQUIRREL BUT MORE PROPERLY HE IS A ROCK SQUIRREL
AS HE LIVES FOR THE MOST PART FAR FROM THE HOMES OF MEN HE DOES LESS DAMAGE TO MAN THAN DOES HIS COUSIN YOWLER THE BOB CAT TUFTY MUST DEPEND WHOLLY FOR HIS LIVING ON THE LITTLE PEOPLE OF THE GREEN FOREST SOMETIMES HE WILL ATTACK A FOX
STRETCHING DOWN FULL LENGTH HE COULD JUST REACH THE BRANCH BELOW HIM YOU SEE HE EXPLAINED IF THERE WAS A NEST ON THIS BRANCH DOWN HERE AH COULD GET THOSE EGGS WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
YET I COULD WALK TO IT IN A FEW MINUTES HOW DO YOU KNOW SHADOW IS THE MOST AWFUL FELLOW IN THE GREAT WORLD I JUST KNOW THAT'S ALL
HE SAID WHY YOU
IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN THE WAY HE CAN STEER HIMSELF AROUND IT WHEN HE REACHES THE TREE HE IS JUMPING FOR HE SHOOTS UP A LITTLE WAY AND LANDS ON THE TRUNK NOT FAR ABOVE THE GROUND THEN HE SCAMPERS UP THAT TREE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN
WAY OUT IN THE FAR WEST HE GROWS A LITTLE BIGGER HIS COAT IS A SOFT YELLOWISH BROWN ABOVE BENEATH HE IS ALL WHITE HIS FUR IS WONDERFULLY SOFT
THOSE BACK DOORWAYS ARE VERY HANDY IN TIME OF DANGER DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE THREE DOORWAYS ASKED HAPPY JACK
BY DAY THE ENTRANCES ARE CLOSED WITH EARTH FROM INSIDE FOR THE MICE ARE ACTIVE ONLY AT NIGHT SOMETIMES THE BURROWS ARE HIDDEN UNDER BUSHES AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN
ONLY WHEN CORNERED WILL HE FIGHT HE IS POSSESSED OF A LIVELY CURIOSITY AND OFTEN HE WILL STEALTHILY FOLLOW A HUNTER OR TRAPPER FOR MILES THE FUR OF HIS COAT IS VERY LONG AND HANDSOME AND HE IS HUNTED AND TRAPPED FOR THIS
WHERE IS YOUR HOME ASKED JOHNNY CHUCK I KNOW SAID PETER RABBIT IT'S UP IN A BIG HOLLOW TREE UNC BILLY LOOKED DOWN AT PETER
YOWLER IS HIMSELF A LYNX THE BAY LYNX IN SOME PLACES HE IS CALLED SIMPLY WILD CAT IN OTHERS HE IS CALLED THE CATAMOUNT HE IS NOT SO FOND OF THE THICK FORESTS AS HE IS OF SWAMPS BRUSH GROWN HILLSIDES
YOU SAW HIM SIMPLY JUMP JUST REMEMBER THAT THE ONLY ANIMALS IN THIS GREAT LAND WHO CAN FLY ARE THE BATS
IT WAS SOME JUMP EXCLAIMED JUMPER THE HARE ADMIRINGLY
ALL THE POCKET MICE ARE MUCH ALIKE THEY MAKE BURROWS IN THE GROUND OFTEN THROWING UP A LITTLE MOUND WITH SEVERAL ENTRANCES WHICH LEAD TO A CENTRAL PASSAGEWAY CONNECTING WITH THE BEDROOM AND STOREROOMS
A LITTLE ROUND BALL OF GRASS AND OTHER VEGETABLE MATTER THIS IS PLACED IN THICK GRASS OR WEEDS CLOSE TO THE GROUND OR IN BUSHES OR LOW TREES SEVERAL FEET FROM THE GROUND
WAS THAT ALL OF YOUR ADVENTURE JUMPER NO REPLIED JUMPER I REMAINED RIGHT WHERE I WAS FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT JUST AS DAYLIGHT WAS BEGINNING TO STEAL THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST I DECIDED THAT IT WAS SAFE TO LEAVE MY HIDING PLACE AND COME OVER HERE
PETER RABBIT BOLTED FOR A HOLLOW LOG STRIPED CHIPMUNK VANISHED IN A HOLE UNDER AN OLD STUMP JOHNNY CHUCK BACKED UP AGAINST THE TRUNK OF A TREE AND MADE READY TO FIGHT ONLY HAPPY JACK THE GRAY SQUIRREL
JOHNNY CHUCK HUNG HIS HEAD FOR HE WAS A LITTLE ASHAMED THAT HE HAD BEEN SO UNWILLING TO COME THAT MORNING IF YOU PLEASE MOTHER NATURE SAID HE I THINK I'LL COME I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD ANY CLOSE RELATIVES AND I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM
YOWLER'S FEET ARE LARGE BUT TUFTY'S ARE IMMENSE FOR HIS SIZE
LARGE ERMINE OR YELLOW BELLIED WEASEL HIS SMALLEST COUSIN IS THE LEAST WEASEL THE LATTER IS NOT MUCH LONGER THAN A MOUSE IN WINTER HE IS ALL WHITE EVEN THE TIP OF HIS TAIL
CRIED PETER RIGHT YOU ARE REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE HOWEVER DID YOU FIND IT OUT I DIDN'T EXACTLY FIND IT OUT I GUESSED IT REPLIED PETER
CAME THE POSSUM FAMILY AND A FUNNY LOOKING SIGHT THEY WERE UNC BILLY WAS WHITISH GRAY HIS FACE WHITER THAN THE REST OF HIM HE LOOKED AS IF HE HAD JUST GOTTEN OUT OF BED
CHAPTER SEVEN JOHNNY CHUCK JOINS THE CLASS
HIS EARS WERE MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE OF WHITEFOOT BUT THE GREATEST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO WERE IN THEIR HIND LEGS AND TAILS THE HIND LEGS AND FEET OF NIMBLEHEELS WERE LONG
MISTER AND MISSUS TUFTY OFTEN HUNT TOGETHER AND IN EARLY WINTER THE WHOLE FAMILY OFTEN JOIN IN THE HUNT YOWLER AND TUFTY ARE THE ONLY MEMBERS OF THE CAT FAMILY NOW FOUND IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY
WITH A PAIR OF TWINKLING BLACK EYES HELLO UNC BILLY CRIED PETER HOW ARE YOU AND OL MISSUS POSSUM PO'LY PETER PO'LY
HE HAS VERY SHORT LEGS AND HIS EARS ARE SO SMALL THAT THEY ARE QUITE HIDDEN IN THE FUR AROUND THEM
HE WAS ABOUT AS LONG AS CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL BUT LOOKED LONGER BECAUSE OF HIS SLIM BODY AND LONG NECK HE WAS BROWN ABOVE AND WHITE BELOW HIS FRONT FEET WERE WHITE AND HIS HIND FEET
EVERY FEW HOPS HE WOULD STOP TO THINK BUT ALL HIS STOPPING AND ALL HIS THINKING WERE IN VAIN AND WHEN HE STARTED FOR SCHOOL THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS AS PUZZLED AS EVER
IN SUMMER HE IS A PURER WHITE UNDERNEATH THAN HIS LARGER COUSINS ALL OF THE WEASELS ARE ALIKE IN HABITS WHEN RUNNING THEY BOUND OVER THE GROUND MUCH AS PETER RABBIT DOES
HE MUST BE A MEMBER OF THE MOUSE FAMILY BUT HE ISN'T LIKE ANY OF THE MICE YOU HAVE TOLD US ABOUT CONTINUED HAPPY JACK HE IS SO SMALL HE CAN HIDE UNDER A LEAF I'M SURE HE MUST BE A MOUSE
I AM AFRAID OF SHADOW THE WEASEL REDDY FOX HAS TRIED TO DIG ME OUT MORE THAN ONCE BUT I CAN DIG FASTER THAN HE CAN IF HE EVER GETS ME CORNERED HE'LL FIND THAT I CAN FIGHT
THE PRETTY LITTLE SPOTTED BABIES OF LIGHTFOOT THE DEER ARE VICTIMS WHENEVER HE CAN FIND THEM THE DARKER AND DEEPER THE GREEN FOREST THE BETTER TUFTY LIKES IT HE MAKES HIS DEN UNDER GREAT TANGLES OF FALLEN TREES OR SIMILAR PLACES
IN THE GREAT FORESTS OF THE FAR NORTH LIVES YOWLER'S COUSIN TUFTY THE CANADA LYNX ALSO CALLED LOUP CERVIER AND LUCIVEE HE IS NEARLY A THIRD LARGER THAN YOWLER FROM THE TIP OF EACH EAR LONG TUFTS OF BLACK HAIR STAND UP
HE HAD FOUND MY TRACKS WHERE I HAD BEEN GATHERING BEECHNUTS AND HE WAS FOLLOWING THEM WITH HIS NOSE JUST THE WAY BOWSER THE HOUND FOLLOWS REDDY FOX I NEARLY DIED OF FRIGHT WHEN I SAW HIM
I MEAN JUMPING HE LOOKS AS IF HE HAD WINGS INSISTED JUMPER STUBBORNLY THAT IS SIMPLY BECAUSE I HAVE GIVEN HIM A FOLD OF SKIN BETWEEN THE FRONT AND HIND LEG ON EACH SIDE EXPLAINED OLD MOTHER NATURE
BUT TO AGGRANDIZE THEIR OWN POWER WHICH GOD HAS VERY JUSTLY ABATED THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ENTERPRISE BY MANY A ONE WITH WHICH THEY HAVE OPPRESSED THE CITY
THE FLORENTINES MURMUR AGAINST THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ADVOCATES OF THE WAR
THE REST WILL BE SAVED AS A MATTER OF COURSE IF WE LOSE HER
AND WHICH FROM THEIR NAME IS STILL CALLED HUNGARY TO THESE DISORDERS IT MUST BE ADDED THAT THE EMPEROR SEEING HIMSELF ATTACKED ON SO MANY SIDES TO LESSEN THE NUMBER OF HIS ENEMIES BEGAN TO TREAT FIRST WITH THE VANDALS THEN WITH THE FRANKS
NOT BY THE INFLUENCE OF LIBERTY OR SUBJECTION AS MANY SUPPOSE BUT BY THAT OF SLAVERY AND LICENSE FOR WITH THE NOBILITY OR THE PEOPLE THE MINISTERS RESPECTIVELY OF SLAVERY OR LICENTIOUSNESS
AND IF AS EVER HE IS STILL THE ENEMY OF THE WICKED DO NOT THEREFORE PROMISE THYSELF ANY CERTAINTY OF VICTORY FOR THE JUST WRATH OF THE ALMIGHTY WILL WEIGH HEAVILY UPON THEE AND WE ARE RESOLVED TO LOSE OUR LIBERTY ONLY WITH OUR LIVES
AND VELAMIR KING OF THE OSTROGOTHS BECAME SUBJECT TO HIM ATTILA HAVING ENTERED ITALY LAID SIEGE TO AQUILEIA WHERE HE REMAINED WITHOUT ANY OBSTACLE FOR TWO YEARS WASTING THE COUNTRY ROUND AND DISPERSING THE INHABITANTS
AND AFTER THE DEATHS OF MANY EMPERORS THE EMPIRE OF CONSTANTINOPLE DEVOLVED UPON ZENO AND THAT OF ROME UPON ORESTES AND AUGUSTULUS HIS SON WHO OBTAINED THE SOVEREIGNTY BY FRAUD WHILE THEY WERE DESIGNING TO HOLD BY FORCE WHAT THEY HAD OBTAINED BY TREACHERY
AND FAITHLESS ARMS LIKE THINE MAY OUR EXAMPLE INSTRUCT POSTERITY SINCE THAT OF THEBES AND PHILIP OF MACEDON WHO AFTER VICTORY OVER HER ENEMIES FROM BEING HER CAPTAIN BECAME HER FOE AND HER PRINCE
THE PROSPECT OF THIS CONNECTION HAD GREAT INFLUENCE WITH THE COUNT FOR AS THE DUKE HAD NO SONS IT GAVE HIM HOPE OF BECOMING SOVEREIGN OF MILAN FOR THIS REASON HE GRADUALLY ABATED HIS EXERTIONS IN THE WAR
THESE THINGS DISTURBED THE MINDS OF THE CITIZENS AND MADE THEM APPREHENSIVE OF NEW TROUBLES CONSIDER THE MEANS TO BE ADOPTED FOR THEIR DEFENSE
AND THAT BECOMING UNABLE EITHER TO DEFEND THEMSELVES OR TRUST THE COUNT THEY WOULD BE COMPELLED HAVING NO OTHER RESOURCE TO FALL INTO THEIR HANDS HAVING TAKEN THIS RESOLUTION THEY SOUNDED THE COUNT AND FOUND HIM QUITE DISPOSED FOR PEACE
BOTH BY THE REDUCTION IN THEIR NUMBER AND BY INCREASING THE AUTHORITY OF THE GREAT WHO ON ACCOUNT OF FORMER ENMITIES WOULD BE DISINCLINED TO FAVOR THEM HE ADDED THAT IT IS A GOOD THING
BY REDUCING THE COMPANIES FROM FOURTEEN TO SEVEN
AND RENDERED OUR ENEMY MORE POWERFUL AND MORE DISPOSED TO OPPRESS US SO THAT IT IS FAR PREFERABLE TO HAVE THIS WAR UPON OUR HANDS AND ENJOY THE FAVOR OF THE DUKE THAN TO BE IN PEACE WITHOUT IT
RINALDO DEGLI ALBIZZI ADDRESSES AN ASSEMBLY OF CITIZENS AND ADVISES THE RESTORATION OF THE GRANDI
A COURSE WHICH DIMINISHED HIS OWN POWER AND INCREASED THAT OF THE BARBARIANS NOR WAS THE ISLAND OF BRITAIN WHICH IS NOW CALLED ENGLAND SECURE FROM THEM FOR THE BRITONS BEING APPREHENSIVE OF THOSE WHO HAD OCCUPIED GAUL CALLED THE ANGLI
LICENSE AND SLAVERY PECULIAR DEFECTS IN REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENTS APPLICATION OF THIS REFLECTION TO THE STATE OF FLORENCE GIOVANNI DI BICCI DI MEDICI RE ESTABLISHES THE AUTHORITY OF HIS FAMILY
WHO WERE CONQUERED BY CAIUS MARIUS WAS THE VISIGOTHS WHICH NAME IN OUR LANGUAGE SIGNIFIES WESTERN GOTHS THESE AFTER SOME BATTLES FOUGHT ALONG ITS CONFINES LONG HELD THEIR SEAT OF DOMINION UPON THE DANUBE WITH CONSENT OF THE EMPERORS
SO THAT THERE WAS NOTHING EITHER INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL TO OCCASION UNEASINESS NEXT TO NICCOLO DA UZZANO IN AUTHORITY WERE BARTOLOMEO VALORI
AND THAT IN THE INTERIM SOME EVENT WOULD OCCUR FOR THEIR RELIEF AS HAD BEEN THE CASE DURING THE FORMER WARS WHICH THE FLORENTINES HAD CARRIED ON AGAINST THEM THEIR ONLY APPREHENSION AROSE FROM THE FICKLE MINDS OF THE PLEBEIANS WHO BECOMING WEARY OF THE SIEGE
WHILE THE FORMER BRINGS ALIKE GRATIFICATION AND PROFIT THEN DIRECTING HIS DISCOURSE MORE PARTICULARLY TO RINALDO HE SAID
ALL THAT RINALDO HAD ADVANCED WAS CORRECT AND THE REMEDIES HE PROPOSED GOOD AND CERTAIN IF THEY COULD BE ADOPTED WITHOUT AN ABSOLUTE DIVISION OF THE CITY AND THIS HE HAD NO DOUBT
BUT IF WE FOUND WE COULD NOT ULTIMATELY DEFEND IT WE WOULD SUBMIT OURSELVES TO ANYONE RATHER THAN TO THEE AND IF OUR SINS BE SO GREAT THAT IN SPITE OF OUR UTMOST RESOLUTION WE SHOULD STILL FALL INTO THY HANDS BE QUITE ASSURED
THE COUNT COMMENCED OPERATIONS AGAINST LUCCA IN APRIL FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND THE FLORENTINES DESIROUS OF RECOVERING WHAT THEY HAD THEMSELVES LOST BEFORE THEY ATTACKED OTHERS RETOOK SANTA MARIA IN CASTELLO
FINDING THE STRONG POSITION WHICH THE FLORENTINES HAD TAKEN PREVENTED HIM FROM RELIEVING FURLI DETERMINED TO ATTEMPT THE CAPTURE OF ZAGONARA THINKING THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT PLACE TO BE LOST
GIORGIO ORDELAFFI WAS LORD OF FURLI
BUT SHE BEING OF IMPERIAL BLOOD SCORNED THE CONNECTION OF A PRIVATE CITIZEN AND BEING ANXIOUS TO AVENGE HERSELF FOR THE INSULT SECRETLY PERSUADED GENSERIC KING OF THE VANDALS AND MASTER OF AFRICA TO COME TO ITALY
AT THE DECEASE OF HIS SON IN LAW HELD THE BORGO SAN SEPOLCRO AND OTHER FORTRESSES OF THAT DISTRICT AND WHILE NICCOLO LIVED GOVERNED THEM IN HIS NAME CLAIMING THEM AS HIS DAUGHTER'S PORTION
AT LEAST TILL THEY COULD DEPRIVE THE COUNT OF THE AID OF THE VENETIANS WHO THEY DID NOT THINK WOULD LONG BE EITHER FRIENDLY OR FAITHFUL TO HIM ON THE OTHER HAND THE COUNT PERFECTLY AWARE OF THIS THOUGHT IT NOT IMPRUDENT SUPPOSING THE OBLIGATION OF THE TREATY INSUFFICIENT
HE REFUSED TO GIVE THEM UP TO THE POPE WHO DEMANDED THEM AS PROPERTY HELD OF THE CHURCH AND WHO UPON HIS REFUSAL SENT THE PATRIARCH WITH FORCES TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THEM THE COUNT FINDING HIMSELF UNABLE TO SUSTAIN THE ATTACK OFFERED THEM TO THE FLORENTINES
WITH COMPLAINTS AND ALL CONDEMNED
TO THESE THEY ADDED OTHER LEADERS AND REMOUNTED SOME OF THOSE WHO HAD LOST THEIR HORSES IN THE LATE DEFEAT THEY ALSO APPOINTED TWENTY CITIZENS TO LEVY NEW TAXES
AND PREPARE TO FRUSTRATE THE ENEMY'S DESIGNS AND IF HE WERE TO REMAIN QUIET IT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY TO GO TO WAR WITH HIM
BUT FOUND HIM INDISPOSED TO DO SO FOR THE DUKE HAVING BEEN INFORMED THAT OUT OF REGARD TO HIM HE HAD REFUSED TO CROSS THE PO THOUGHT THAT BY THIS MEANS HE MIGHT ALSO SAVE THE LUCCHESE
WHICH ENJOYED FREEDOM UNDER THE DOGIATE OF TOMMASO DA CAMPO FREGOSO HE DID NOT THINK IT ADVISABLE TO ATTEMPT THIS
THE ELDEST SON OF MASO WHO BY HIS OWN TALENTS AND THE RESPECT HE DERIVED FROM THE MEMORY OF HIS FATHER ASPIRED TO THE FIRST OFFICES IN THE GOVERNMENT
AND THAT IF TO THE BENEFITS HE HAD CONFERRED ON THEE OUR OWN WERE ADDED THE FRIENDSHIP WE SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH WOULD NOT ONLY BE FIRM BUT INSEPARABLE WITH THIS IMPRESSION WE ADDED VERONA OR BRESCIA TO THY PREVIOUS APPOINTMENTS
BUT THE INHABITANTS BEING ROBBED OF THEIR HOME BECAME DESPERATE BY NECESSITY AND RESOLVED TO TAKE POSSESSION OF SOME OTHER COUNTRY ALTHOUGH THEY HAD BEEN UNABLE TO DEFEND THEIR OWN THEY THEREFORE CROSSED THE SEA WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND SETTLED IN THE COUNTRY NEAREST TO THE BEACH
ANGLES GIVE THE NAME TO ENGLAND ATTILA KING OF THE HUNS IN ITALY GENSERIC TAKES ROME THE LOMBARDS THE PEOPLE WHO INHABIT THE NORTHERN PARTS BEYOND THE RHINE AND THE DANUBE
AND TO MAKE ALL SENSIBLE OF ITS INJUSTICE THEY CONTRIVED THAT THE TAXES SHOULD BE LEVIED WITH THE UTMOST RIGOR AND MADE IT LAWFUL TO KILL ANY THAT MIGHT RESIST THE OFFICERS EMPLOYED TO COLLECT THEM
WHO ESTABLISHES ORDINANCES CAPABLE OF APPEASING OR RESTRAINING THESE CONTENDING DISPOSITIONS SO AS TO PREVENT THEM FROM DOING MISCHIEF THEN THE GOVERNMENT MAY BE CALLED FREE AND
TO THESE REPROACHES WAS ADDED ALL THAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM AN ENRAGED MULTITUDE SEEING THE DISCONTENT SO PREVALENT
IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT SO GREAT MILITARY SUPERIORITY COMBINED WITH SUCH AN EXTENT OF TERRITORY WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO THEMSELVES
OR THE VENETIANS HER LORDS AND SURELY UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES NO ONE COULD DOUBT WHICH WOULD BE MOST TO THEIR ADVANTAGE TO HAVE FOR THEIR NEIGHBOR A POWERFUL FRIEND OR A FAR MORE POWERFUL FOE NEITHER NEED IT BE APPREHENDED THAT THE MILANESE
AND WHATEVER ELSE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY HIM DURING THE LATE CAMPAIGNS AND CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THOSE TERRITORIES WHICH THE DUKE POSSESSED AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH WHEN THIS TREATY BECAME KNOWN AT MILAN IT GRIEVED THE CITIZENS MORE THAN THE VICTORY AT CARAVAGGIO HAD EXHILARATED THEM
HE RESTORED OUR LIBERTY IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT HE WILL DEFEND IT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST FOE OF OUR INVETERATE ENEMIES IF THEREFORE TO AVOID INCENSING THE FLORENTINES WE HAD EXCITED HIS ANGER WE SHOULD HAVE LOST OUR BEST FRIEND
EVIDENTLY DESIROUS THAT THE HONOR AND ADVANTAGE OF THE VICTORY AT CARAVAGGIO SHOULD BE HIS OWN AND NOT ACCRUE TO THE MILANESE THE PARTIES THEREFORE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE VENETIANS UNDERTOOK TO PAY THE COUNT THIRTEEN THOUSAND FLORINS PER MONTH TILL HE SHOULD OBTAIN MILAN
THUS ENCOURAGED THE CITIZENS ENGAGED COUNT ODDO THE SON OF BRACCIO AND UNITED WITH HIM FOR DIRECTING THE OPERATIONS OF THE WAR
BESIDES WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN EXPECTING THAT HE WILL RESCUE US FROM THE DANGERS INTO WHICH WE ARE BROUGHT ON HIS ACCOUNT IF WE ONLY DO NOT ABANDON OUR OWN CAUSE YOU ALL KNOW HOW FIERCELY THE FLORENTINES HAVE FREQUENTLY ASSAILED US
BUT IF THEY WERE TO STRIKE THE FIRST BLOW AT THE DUKE PUBLIC OPINION WOULD BE AS FAVORABLE TO HIM AS TO THEMSELVES AND BESIDES THEY COULD NOT SO CONFIDENTLY DEMAND ASSISTANCE AS ASSAILANTS
THE LUCCHESE AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED SEEING THE IMMINENT PERIL OF THEIR SITUATION HAD RECOURSE TO THE DUKE AND EMPLOYED PRAYERS AND REMONSTRANCES TO INDUCE HIM TO RENDER THEM AID THEY ENLARGED UPON THEIR OWN MERITS AND THE OFFENSES OF THE FLORENTINES
AND HIS SUCCESSOR ASTOLPHUS HAVING MARRIED PLACIDIA SISTER OF THE EMPERORS AGREED WITH THEM TO GO TO THE RELIEF OF GAUL AND SPAIN WHICH PROVINCES HAD BEEN ASSAILED BY THE VANDALS BURGUNDIANS ALANS AND FRANKS FROM THE CAUSES BEFORE MENTIONED
THEIR JEALOUSY OF HIM
WHO AT FIRST IN ORDER TO CONCILIATE DID NOT COMPLAIN OF THEIR OWN PARTICULAR HARDSHIPS
AND EITHER NEGLIGENT OF THE THREATENED DANGERS BECAUSE RENDERED FEARLESS BY PROSPERITY OR ENCOURAGING THEM THROUGH MUTUAL ENVY THEY GAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THE FAMILY OF THE MEDICI TO RECOVER THEIR INFLUENCE
ESTEEMED THEM THE LESS AND THEREFORE HAD THE LESS OCCASION TO GRIEVE FOR THEIR ABSENCE THE OTHER TAKING THEM FROM THOSE WHO BEING ACCUSTOMED TO THEIR POSSESSION
WAR DECLARED THE FLORENTINES ARE ROUTED BY THE DUCAL FORCES REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENTS MORE ESPECIALLY THOSE IMPERFECTLY ORGANIZED FREQUENTLY CHANGE THEIR RULERS AND THE FORM OF THEIR INSTITUTIONS
SLEW THE ONE AND COMPELLED THE OTHER WITH HIS HUNS TO REPASS THE DANUBE AND RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY
AND BEING COME WE COULD NOT PREVENT THEIR AGGRESSIONS YOU KNOW THAT WITHOUT THE AID OF SOME POWERFUL ALLY WE ARE INCAPABLE OF SELF DEFENSE AND THAT NONE CAN RENDER US THIS SERVICE MORE POWERFULLY OR FAITHFULLY THAN THE DUKE
WHAT MORE COULD WE EITHER GIVE OR PROMISE THEE WHAT ELSE COULDST THOU NOT FROM US MERELY BUT FROM ANY OTHERS HAVE EITHER HAD OR EXPECTED
THEREFORE YOU MUST NOT IMAGINE IT TO BE OCCASIONED BY HIS ARRIVAL BUT RATHER BY YOUR OWN ILL FORTUNE AND THEIR AMBITION
BUT THESE ADVANTAGES ARE AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN DENIED TO THOSE WHICH FREQUENTLY CHANGE FROM TYRANNY TO LICENSE OR THE REVERSE BECAUSE
THOUGH LATE AWARE OF THY PRIDE CRUELTY AND AMBITION COME HITHER NOT TO ASK AUGHT NOR WITH THE HOPE EVEN IF WE WERE SO DISPOSED OF OBTAINING IT BUT TO REMIND THEE OF THE BENEFITS THOU HAST RECEIVED FROM THE PEOPLE OF MILAN
HE ADVISED THEM TO IMITATE THE CONDUCT OF THEIR FOREFATHERS WHO BY COURAGEOUS CONDUCT IN ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCES HAD DEFENDED THEMSELVES AGAINST ALL THEIR ENEMIES
OR SUBMIT TO ANY TERMS THAT COULD VIOLATE THEIR LIBERTY THEY THEN MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE CITY IN THE MEANTIME THE FLORENTINE FORCES WERE NOT IDLE AND AFTER INNUMERABLE MISCHIEFS DONE TO THE COUNTRY
AND THAT GIOVANNI POSSESSED SEVERAL QUALITIES FAR SURPASSING THOSE OF SALVESTRO THE ASSOCIATES OF NICCOLO WERE UNINFLUENCED BY HIS REMARKS FOR THEY WERE JEALOUS OF HIS REPUTATION AND DESIRED TO EXALT SOME PERSON
ITS INSTITUTIONS FIRM AND SECURE FOR HAVING GOOD LAWS FOR ITS BASIS AND GOOD REGULATIONS FOR CARRYING THEM INTO EFFECT IT NEEDS NOT LIKE OTHERS
HE DETERMINED TO DUPE THE VENETIANS AND NOT ABANDON HIS ENTERPRISE THEREFORE APPEARING OPENLY TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL FOR PEACE
AFTER THIS SEVERAL IMPORTANT EVENTS OCCURRED BOTH IN ITALY
TO MAKE THE VISIGOTHS THEIR ENEMIES HE ADVISED THAT THE ACCUSTOMED STIPEND ALLOWED TO THIS PEOPLE SHOULD BE WITHHELD AND AS HE THOUGHT THESE ENEMIES WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT ALONE TO DISTURB THE EMPIRE
HE CONTRIVED THAT THE BURGUNDIANS FRANKS VANDALS AND ALANS A NORTHERN PEOPLE IN SEARCH OF NEW HABITATIONS SHOULD ASSAIL THE ROMAN PROVINCES
DESTROYED THAT VIGILANCE OVER THOSE WHO MIGHT INJURE THEM WHICH THEY OUGHT TO HAVE EXERCISED THUS DAILY RENEWING THE HATRED OF A MASS OF THE PEOPLE BY THEIR SINISTER PROCEEDINGS
THAT IF WE ARE TO APPLAUD EVIL COUNSELS BECAUSE THEY ARE SOMETIMES FOLLOWED BY FORTUNATE EVENTS WE SHOULD ONLY ENCOURAGE MEN IN ERROR WHICH WOULD BRING GREAT MISCHIEF UPON THE REPUBLIC
WHICH HAD BEEN COMMENCED LONG AGO AS TO ENABLE THEM TO PERFORM DIVINE SERVICE IN IT REQUESTED HIS HOLINESS TO CONSECRATE IT TO THIS THE PONTIFF WILLINGLY AGREED AND THE FLORENTINES TO EXHIBIT THE WEALTH OF THE CITY AND THE SPLENDOR OF THE EDIFICE AND DO GREATER HONOR TO THE POPE
IT THEREFORE SEEMED NECESSARY TO CURB HIS INSOLENCE AND NOT ALLOW IT TO INCREASE TILL IT BECAME INCORRIGIBLE AND THAT IF THE FLORENTINES FROM FEAR OR ANY OTHER MOTIVE WISHED TO PRESERVE HIS FRIENDSHIP THEY MUST PAY HIM THEMSELVES COSMO RETURNED
SHOWED NO LESS FOLLY IN THE PRINCES THEMSELVES THAN INFIDELITY IN THEIR MINISTERS
HE THEN MODESTLY REMINDED THEM OF WHAT HE HAD SAID UPON A FORMER OCCASION AND OF THEIR RELUCTANCE TO REMEDY THE EVIL WHEN IT MIGHT EASILY HAVE BEEN DONE
HE COULD NOT AVOID FEELING REGRET AND DISPLEASURE SIMILAR TO WHAT THE MILANESE HAD EXPERIENCED WHEN HE ABANDONED THEM HE TOOK TWO DAYS TO CONSIDER THE REPLY HE WOULD MAKE TO THE AMBASSADORS WHOM THE VENETIANS HAD SENT TO INFORM HIM OF THE TREATY AND DURING THIS TIME
BUT FOR OUR SIMPLICITY WE RECEIVED THEE TO OUR HOME ACTUATED BY REVERENCE FOR THE HAPPY MEMORY OF OUR DUKE WITH WHOM BEING CONNECTED BY MARRIAGE AND RENEWED ALLIANCE WE BELIEVED THY AFFECTION WOULD DESCEND TO THOSE WHO HAD INHERITED HIS AUTHORITY
EXPLAINING TO THEM HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS TO AGGRANDIZE ONE WHO POSSESSED SO MUCH INFLUENCE THAT IT WAS EASY TO REMEDY AN EVIL AT ITS COMMENCEMENT
BUT EVERYTHING TENDED TO EXCITE SUSPICION
ASSEMBLED AT BALE CAME TO VENICE
AND AS IN THE TREATY WHICH FILIPPO MADE WITH THE DOGE OF GENOA
VELAMIR KING OF THE OSTROGOTHS AND THE HEADS OF THE OTHER NATIONS TOOK ARMS AGAINST HIS SONS
AND ADVISED THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF RELIEF BUT THEIR ADVICE WAS REJECTED IN THE COUNCILS THEREFORE TO RENDER THE LAW AS OFFENSIVE AS POSSIBLE
THE INHABITANTS OF WHICH ALTHOUGH FAITHFUL TO THEIR RULERS BEING INFLUENCED MORE BY IMMEDIATE DANGER THAN BY ATTACHMENT TO THEIR DISTANT FRIENDS SURRENDERED IN THE SAME MANNER THEY OBTAINED MASSA AND SEREZANA TOWARD THE END OF MAY THEY PROCEEDED IN THE DIRECTION OF LUCCA
THE FLORENTINES FINDING IMOLA IN THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY AND THE WAR PUBLICLY KNOWN SENT THEIR FORCES TO FURLI AND BESIEGED IT ON ALL SIDES THAT THE DUKE'S PEOPLE MIGHT NOT RELIEVE IT
MANY OTHERS WERE INCLINED TO ACCEDE TO IT
MEASURES FOR THE PROSECUTION OF THE WAR ATTEMPT OF THE HIGHER CLASSES TO DEPRIVE THE PLEBEIANS OF THEIR SHARE IN THE GOVERNMENT
WITH WHOM THEY MADE PEACE AND ENTERED INTO ALLIANCE
AND THOUGHT HIS PROCEEDINGS NEED NOT HAVE EXCITED SO MUCH DISTRUST THAT APPOINTING THE TEN AND HIRING FORCES WAS IN ITSELF A MANIFEST DECLARATION OF WAR WHICH IF UNDERTAKEN AGAINST SO GREAT A PRINCE
COSMO DE MEDICI DISPOSED TO DO SO THE FLORENTINES SENT AMBASSADORS TO THE COUNT AFTER THIS VICTORY THE COUNT MARCHED INTO THE BRESCIAN TERRITORY OCCUPIED THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND THEN PITCHED HIS CAMP WITHIN TWO MILES OF THE CITY THE VENETIANS
AND THE FUTURE EXPENSE WOULD NOT BE SO GREAT AS THE FORMER HAD BEEN FOR LESS PREPARATION IS NECESSARY FOR THOSE ENGAGED IN SELF DEFENSE THAN FOR THOSE WHO DESIGN TO ATTACK OTHERS
WHO REFUSED THEM LIKEWISE UNLESS THE POPE WOULD CONSENT THEY SHOULD RESTORE THEM TO THE COUNT TO WHICH AFTER MUCH HESITATION HE ACCEDED ON CONDITION THAT THE FLORENTINES SHOULD PREVAIL WITH THE COUNT DI POPPI TO RESTORE THE BORGO TO HIM
KYRIL IT'S ALL RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM WHERE A SAMOVAR STEAMED ON THE TABLE AND THERE WERE PLATES FULL OF BREAD AND RAW FISH A MAN IN UNIFORM EMERGED FROM BEHIND THE WINDOW CURTAINS AND ANOTHER DRESSED LIKE A WORKMAN FROM A CLOSET
ABOVE ALL COUNTED ON THE SUDDENNESS OF THEIR ATTACK THEIR PLAN WAS DISCOVERED IN TIME BY SUB LIEUTENANT BLAGONRAVOV THANKS TO THE REVOLUTIONARY VIGILANCE OF A SOLDIER OF THE RED GUARD WHOSE NAME SHALL BE MADE PUBLIC
CUTTING TO THE BONE AT THE FIRST HOTEL WE ENTERED AN OFFICE ILLUMINATED BY TWO CANDLES YES WE HAVE SOME VERY COMFORTABLE ROOMS BUT ALL THE WINDOWS ARE SHOT OUT IF THE GOSPODIN DOES NOT MIND A LITTLE FRESH AIR
ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE COMMISSARS REPORTED CAPTURE OF THE TELEPHONE EXCHANGE STREET FIGHTING THE TAKING OF THE VLADIMIR SCHOOL THE DUMA SAID TRUPP IS ON THE SIDE OF THE DEMOCRACY IN ITS STRUGGLE AGAINST ARBITRARY VIOLENCE
WHICH CAME DOWN IN A STEADY STREAM FROM THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS IN SESSION UPSTAIRS ON THE ORDER IN WHICH LAWS ARE TO BE RATIFIED AND PUBLISHED ESTABLISHING AN EIGHT HOUR DAYS FOR WORKERS AND LUNATCHARSKY'S BASIS FOR A SYSTEM OF POPULAR EDUCATION
THE MOMENT IS DECISIVE EVERYBODY MUST COOPERATE WITH THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE REPORT WHERE THERE ARE STORES OF BARBED WIRE BENZINE GUNS WE'VE WON THE POWER NOW WE MUST KEEP IT THE MENSHEVIK YOFFE TRIED TO READ HIS PARTY'S DECLARATION
AND FINDING SO MANY PRETTY GIRLS FELL BACK IN AN EMBARRASSED WAY AND FUMBLED WITH AWKWARD FEET NOT A GIRL WAS INJURED NOT ONE INSULTED
WE OFFERED THE VLADIMIR YUNKERS A CHANCE TO SURRENDER HE SAID WE WANTED TO SETTLE MATTERS WITHOUT BLOODSHED BUT NOW THAT BLOOD HAS BEEN SPILLED THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY PITILESS STRUGGLE IT WOULD BE CHILDISH TO THINK WE CAN WIN BY ANY OTHER MEANS
AND IMPRECATIONS FROM THE RIGHT AND YET WENT ON SCHREIDER THEY LOOK UPON US AS COUNTER REVOLUTIONARIES AND REPORT US TO THE POPULATION THEY DEPRIVE US OF OUR MEANS OF TRANSPORT BY TAKING AWAY OUR LAST MOTOR CARS
WHEREUPON DESPERATE STREET FIGHTING BURST LIKE A WAVE NEWS OF KERENSKY'S DEFEAT CAME ECHOING BACK THE IMMENSE ROAR OF PROLETARIAN VICTORY KAZAN SARATOV NOVGOROD VINNITZA
ONE HAD A BOTTLE OF WHITE BURGUNDY EVIDENTLY FILCHED FROM THE CELLARS OF THE PALACE THEY LOOKED AT US WITH ASTONISHMENT AS WE MARCHED PAST THROUGH ROOM AFTER ROOM
BUT EVERY MENSHEVIK AND SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY HERE TALKS NOTHING BUT PARTY PROPAGANDA AND AT THE DOOR THEY DISTRIBUTE THEIR ILLEGAL NEWSPAPERS ISKRI SPARKS SOLDATSKI GOLOS AND RABOTCHAYA GAZETA INCITING TO INSURRECTION
WHERE UNDER THE WING OF THE GENERAL STAFF
THE MENSHEVIK GOMBERG AND THREE OR FOUR REPORTERS THEY WERE ALL IN HIGH SPIRITS SEE THEY SAID THE COWARDS ARE AFRAID OF US THEY DON'T DARE ARREST THE DUMA THEIR MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE DOESN'T DARE TO SEND A COMMISSAR INTO THIS BUILDING
THEN I DO NOT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REVOLUTION AND ANARCHY THE BOLSHEVIKI ARE DEPENDING UPON THE PASSIONS OF THE UNBRIDLED MASSES WE HAVE NOTHING BUT MORAL FORCE WE WILL PROTEST AGAINST MASSACRES AND VIOLENCE FROM BOTH SIDES AS OUR TASK IS TO FIND A PEACEFUL ISSUE
OUR COALITION IS THAT OF THE PROLETARIAT AND THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMY WITH THE POOR PEASANTS
COLONEL POLKOVNIKOV WAS IN COMMAND OF THEIR FORCES AND THE ORDERS WERE SIGNED BY GOTZ FORMER MEMBER OF THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT ALLOWED AT LIBERTY ON HIS WORD OF HONOUR
AND FURTHER ALONG WAS BUKHARIN A SHORT RED BEARDED MAN WITH THE EYES OF A FANATIC MORE LEFT THAN LENIN THEY SAID OF HIM THEN THE THREE STROKES OF THE BELL AND WE MADE A RUSH FOR THE TRAIN
LENIN APPEARED FOR A MOMENT TO ANSWER THE ACCUSATIONS OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES THEY CHARGE US WITH STEALING THEIR LAND PROGRAMME IF THAT IS SO WE BOW TO THEM IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR US SO THE MEETING ROARED ON LEADER AFTER LEADER EXPLAINING
CHAPTER TEN MOSCOW THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WITH A FIERCE INTENSITY FOLLOWED UP ITS VICTORY
THE COUNTRY AND THE ARMY ARE THREATENED WITH FAMINE TO FIGHT AGAINST IT THE REGULAR FUNCTIONING OF ALL SERVICES IS INDISPENSABLE THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS GOVERNMENT IS TAKING EVERY MEASURE TO ASSURE THE COUNTRY AND THE ARMY
THE SOLDIERS ON THE ROOF KICKED WITH THEIR HEELS AND SANG WHINING PEASANT SONGS
THE SOLDIERS SAILORS AND WORKERS OF PETROGRAD
THE RESPONSE FROM THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS LIKE A BLAST OF HOT STORM THE INSURGENTS NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO SAY OPENLY THEIR OPINION TO THE MASSES OF WORKERS AND SOLDIERS UPON THE TSAY EE KAH ROLLED IN LIKE BREAKERS THE FIERCE POPULAR CONDEMNATION OF THE DESERTERS
ON EVERY CORNER IMMENSE CROWDS WERE MASSED AROUND A CORE OF HOT DISCUSSION PICKETS OF A DOZEN SOLDIERS WITH FIXED BAYONETS LOUNGED AT THE STREET CROSSINGS RED FACED OLD MEN IN RICH FUR COATS SHOOK THEIR FISTS AT THEM
WALKING UP AND DOWN OR MUTTERING TOGETHER THE SAILORS WOULDN'T LET THEM LEAVE SUDDENLY CAME THE SHARP CRACK OF A RIFLE OUTSIDE FOLLOWED BY A SCATTERED BURST OF FIRING I RAN OUT SOMETHING UNUSUAL WAS GOING ON AROUND THE MARINSKY PALACE
BY FORCE TO TAKE OVER THE INSTITUTIONS OF GOVERNMENT REVOLUTIONARY ORDER REVOLUTIONARY DISCIPLINE
HUGE BOLTS OF RED AND BLACK COTTON CLOTH WERE UNROLLED SERPENTINING ACROSS THE PARQUETED FLOOR AND OVER TABLES AT WHICH SAT HALF A HUNDRED WOMEN CUTTING AND SEWING STREAMERS AND BANNERS FOR THE FUNERAL OF THE REVOLUTIONARY DEAD
OCCASIONALLY SOME ONE IN AUTHORITY MOUNTED THE TRIBUNE AND ASKED THE COMRADES NOT TO SMOKE THEN EVERYBODY SMOKERS AND ALL TOOK UP THE CRY
A MAN OF DEMOCRATIC INSTINCTS HAD HESITATED ABOUT OPPOSING THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
HUNG WITH RED SHROUDED PICTURES IN GOLD FRAMES TO THE SPLENDID STATE SALON
DARK AND SILENT AND COLD WERE THE CHURCHES THE PRIESTS HAD DISAPPEARED
THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE MOSCOW SOVIET WAS IN THE PALACE OF THE FORMER GOVERNOR GENERAL AN IMPOSING WHITE BUILDING FRONTING SKOBELIEV SQUARE
ALERT AND SUSPICIOUS THE WORKING CLASS OF THE CITY CONSTITUTED ITSELF A VAST SPY SYSTEM THROUGH THE SERVANTS PRYING INTO BOURGEOIS HOUSEHOLDS AND REPORTING ALL INFORMATION TO THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE WHICH STRUCK WITH AN IRON HAND UNCEASING
RUSSIA AS IT WAS AND WILL BE IN MOSCOW WE WOULD GET THE TRUE FEELING OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE ABOUT THE REVOLUTION LIFE WAS MORE INTENSE THERE FOR THE PAST WEEK THE PETROGRAD MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
THE MASSIVE FACADE OF SMOLNY BLAZED WITH LIGHTS AS WE DROVE UP AND FROM EVERY STREET CONVERGED UPON IT STREAMS OF HURRYING SHAPES DIM IN THE GLOOM
THE EYES OF ALL RUSSIA WERE FIXED ON THE GREY PLAIN BEYOND THE GATES OF PETROGRAD WHERE ALL THE AVAILABLE STRENGTH OF THE OLD ORDER FACED THE UNORGANISED POWER OF THE NEW THE UNKNOWN IN MOSCOW A TRUCE HAD BEEN DECLARED BOTH SIDES PARLEYED
WHICH ACCEPTED HAVING SETTLED THE QUESTION OF POWER THE BOLSHEVIKI TURNED THEIR ATTENTION TO PROBLEMS OF PRACTICAL ADMINISTRATION FIRST OF ALL THE CITY THE COUNTRY THE ARMY MUST BE FED
IN THE BITTER DUSK THEY TRAMPED MEN AND WOMEN THEIR TALL BAYONETS SWAYING THROUGH STREETS FAINTLY LIGHTED AND SLIPPERY WITH MUD BETWEEN SILENT CROWDS OF BOURGEOIS CONTEMPTUOUS BUT FEARFUL
ALLIES OF THE POOR PEASANTS WILL ASSURE COMPLETE REVOLUTIONARY ORDER INDISPENSABLE TO THE VICTORY OF SOCIALISM
IT WAS ALMOST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WHEN AS WE LEFT THE HALL HOLTZMAN OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE CAME RUNNING DOWN THE HALL WITH A TRANSFIGURED FACE IT'S ALL RIGHT HE SHOUTED GRABBING MY HANDS TELEGRAM FROM THE FRONT
THE RUMOUR OF WHOSE COMING WAS THUNDEROUS AS SURF ALREADY THROUGH THE IBERIAN GATE A HUMAN RIVER WAS FLOWING AND THE VAST RED SQUARE WAS SPOTTED WITH PEOPLE THOUSANDS OF THEM I REMARKED THAT AS THE THRONG PASSED THE IBERIAN CHAPEL
FIVE AT THE SIGNATURE OF THE TREATY ALL PRISONERS MADE BY THE TWO PARTIES SHALL BE RELEASED FOR TWO DAYS NOW THE BOLSHEVIKI HAD BEEN IN CONTROL OF THE CITY
MEN IN VARIOUS UNIFORMS WERE COMING AND GOING IN AN AIMLESS WAY AND DOING A GREAT DEAL OF TALKING UP THE NEVSKY THE WHOLE CITY SEEMED TO BE OUT PROMENADING
WITH RACING ENGINE AND OIL SMOKE POURING OUT OF IT A SMALL BOY HAD CLIMBED UP THE SIDE OF THE THING AND WAS LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL OF A MACHINE GUN SOLDIERS AND SAILORS STOOD AROUND EVIDENTLY WAITING FOR SOMETHING
AND IN TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY WILL NOT HAVE ANY MORE BISCUITS WHICH ARE BEING DOLED OUT TO THEM FROM RESERVE SUPPLIES UNTIL NOW NEVER TOUCHED ALREADY DELEGATES FROM ALL PARTS OF THE FRONT ARE TALKING OF A NECESSARY REMOVAL
A GREAT SOLDIER MEETING WAS HELD ON NOVEMBER TWENTY FOURTH ADDRESSED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES BY A VAST MAJORITY LENIN'S POLICY WAS SUSTAINED AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES WERE TOLD THAT THEY MUST ENTER THE GOVERNMENT
KERENSKY AND HELP TO RESTORE ORDER THAT IS ALL VERY WELL I SAID BUT WHY DO YOU COMBINE WITH THE CADETS THE PSEUDO WORKMAN SMILED FRANKLY TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH
LIFE GOING ON AS USUAL WE HAD TICKETS TO THE BALLET AT THE MARINSKY THEATRE ALL THEATRES WERE OPEN BUT IT WAS TOO EXCITING OUT OF DOORS IN THE DARKNESS WE STUMBLED OVER LUMBER PILES BARRICADING THE POLICE BRIDGE
WHY IS THE DOOR LOCKED TO KEEP THE SOLDIERS IN HE ANSWERED
ACROSS THE RED SQUARE A DARK KNOT OF MEN CAME HURRYING THEY SWARMED INTO THE PITS PICKED UP THE TOOLS AND BEGAN DIGGING DIGGING WITHOUT A WORD SO ALL THE LONG NIGHT VOLUNTEERS OF THE PEOPLE RELIEVED EACH OTHER
BECAUSE THE BOLSHEVIKI HAVE MADE A MILITARY CONSPIRACY WITH THE AID OF THE PETROGRAD SOVIET WITHOUT CONSULTING THE OTHER FACTIONS AND PARTIES WE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REMAIN IN THE CONGRESS AND THEREFORE WITHDRAW
METROPOLITAN OF MOSCOW WAS SOON TO EXCOMMUNICATE THE SOVIETS ALSO THE SHOPS WERE CLOSED AND THE PROPERTIED CLASSES STAYED AT HOME BUT FOR OTHER REASONS THIS WAS THE DAY OF THE PEOPLE
I AM STABS CAPITAN VLADIMIR ARTZIBASHEV ABSOLUTELY AT YOUR SERVICE IT DID NOT SEEM TO OCCUR TO HIM THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN FOUR STRANGERS ONE A WOMAN
THE POWER WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE HANDS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WORKERS SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS AND IN THAT CASE IT WILL MEAN A COMPLETE ABOLITION OF LANDLORD TYRANNY IMMEDIATE CHECK OF THE CAPITALISTS IMMEDIATE PROPOSAL OF A JUST PEACE
THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE MOSCOW SOVIETS IT GREW LIGHT FROM AFAR THE VAGUE STIRRING SOUND DEEPENED AND BECAME LOUDER A STEADY AND TREMENDOUS BASS THE CITY WAS RISING
THIS DAY WE HAVE PAID OUR DEBT TO THE INTERNATIONAL PROLETARIAT AND STRUCK A TERRIBLE BLOW AT THE WAR A TERRIBLE BODY BLOW AT ALL THE IMPERIALISTS AND PARTICULARLY AT WILHELM THE EXECUTIONER
THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS IN MEETING IN SUCH UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHY THE TSAY EE KAH CONSIDERS IT UNNECESSARY TO ADDRESS YOU WITH A POLITICAL SPEECH
OVER DRESSED FASHION APING LITTLE GIRLS WITH PINCHED FACES AND LEAKY SHOES GIRL AFTER GIRL FLUSHING WITH PLEASURE AT THE APPLAUSE OF THE NICE PEOPLE OF PETROGRAD OF THE OFFICERS THE RICH THE GREAT NAMES OF POLITICS
THEIR OWN OFFICERS COULD NOT STOP THE TERRIBLE BOMBARDMENT A COMMISSAR FROM SMOLNY NAMED KIRILOV TRIED TO HALT IT HE WAS THREATENED WITH LYNCHING THE RED GUARDS BLOOD WAS UP AT HALF PAST TWO THE YUNKERS HOISTED A WHITE FLAG
OF COURSE CERTAINLY THEY ARE COMING I EXPECT A TELEPHONE CALL EVERY MINUTE TO SAY THAT THEY ARE COMING BUT WE ARE READY WE HAVE YUNKERS IN THE FRONT OF THE PALACE THROUGH THAT DOOR THERE CAN WE GO IN THERE NO
THEN TWO MENSHEVIKI INTERNATIONALISTS DECLARING THAT THE APPEAL OF THE BOLSHEVIK COUNCILLORS WAS A DIRECT INCITEMENT TO MASSACRE IF EVERYTHING THAT IS AGAINST THE BOLSHEVIKI IS COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY SAID PINKEVITCH
MEANWHILE ALL WAS NOT WELL ON THE REVOLUTIONARY FRONT THE ENEMY HAD BROUGHT UP ARMOURED TRAINS MOUNTED WITH CANNON
BUSINESS MEN SPECULATORS INVESTORS LAND OWNERS ARMY OFFICERS POLITICIANS TEACHERS STUDENTS PROFESSIONAL MEN SHOP KEEPERS CLERKS AGENTS THE OTHER SOCIALIST PARTIES HATED THE BOLSHEVIKI WITH AN IMPLACABLE HATRED
AND THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATS INTERNATIONALISTS AND HAD ACCEPTED THE PROPOSITION OF PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION AT THE CONFERENCE EVEN INCLUDING DELEGATES FROM THE ARMY COMMITTEES AND THE PEASANTS SOVIETS IN THE GREAT HALL TROTZKY RECOUNTED THE EVENTS OF THE DAY
LATER THE NEWSPAPERS TOLD OF ANOTHER FRENCH OFFICER
COMMISSAR OF EDUCATION BROKE INTO TEARS AT THE SESSION OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS AND RUSHED FROM THE ROOM CRYING I CANNOT STAND IT I CANNOT BEAR THE MONSTROUS DESTRUCTION OF BEAUTY AND TRADITION
OUR PROGRAMME SAID THE OFFICER THIS IS IT LAND TO BE TURNED OVER TO THE LAND COMMITTEES WORKMEN TO HAVE FULL REPRESENTATION IN THE CONTROL OF INDUSTRY
AT A DESK IN ONE CORNER WAS ROGOV AN INTELLIGENT BEARDED MAN WITH GLASSES WEARING THE BLACK BLOUSE OF A WORKER HE INVITED US TO MARCH WITH THE CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE IN THE FUNERAL PROCESSION NEXT MORNING
WE DEMAND THAT KERENSKY BE ARRESTED AND THAT HE BE ORDERED IN THE NAME OF THE ORGANISATIONS HEREINAFTER MENTIONED
PLAYED TO CROWDED HOUSES THE STREET CARS RAN THE TELEPHONES WERE ALL WORKING WHEN YOU CALLED CENTRAL SHOOTING COULD BE PLAINLY HEARD OVER THE WIRE
ALSO MORTALLY STRICKEN WHO NEVERTHELESS WOULD RETURN AND POUR OUT HIS BEAUTIFUL ELOQUENCE FOR A LOST CAUSE GOTZ SAT THERE DAN LIEBER BOGDANOV BROIDO FILLIPOVSKY
THE REST ABOUT TWO HUNDRED WERE TAKEN TO PETER PAUL UNDER ESCORT IN SMALL GROUPS SO AS TO AVOID NOTICE ON THE WAY A MOB SET UPON ONE PARTY KILLING EIGHT MORE YUNKERS MORE THAN A HUNDRED RED GUARDS AND SOLDIERS HAD FALLEN
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TEACH THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES AND THE MENSHEVIKI ANYTHING HE EXCLAIMED THEY COMPROMISE FROM SHEER HABIT IMAGINE
IN THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN THE SNOW PILED STREETS WERE QUIET WITH THE STILLNESS OF CONVALESCENCE ONLY A FEW ARC LIGHTS WERE BURNING ONLY A FEW PEDESTRIANS HURRIED ALONG THE SIDE WALKS AN ICY WIND BLEW FROM THE GREAT PLAIN
THE WOMEN'S BATTALION IS IN THERE THEY WILL SAY WE HAVE FIRED ON RUSSIAN WOMEN AS WE REACHED THE NEVSKY AGAIN ANOTHER ARMOURED CAR CAME AROUND THE CORNER AND A MAN POKED HIS HEAD OUT OF THE TURRET TOP COME ON
AT HALF PAST ELEVEN THREE FIELD PIECES ARRIVED
WORMING OUR WAY THROUGH THE PACKED AND NOISY AISLE A GOOD NATURED CROWD BEARING THE DISCOMFORT WITH HUMOROUS PATIENCE
AND THERE SEEMED EVEN LESS UNEASINESS AMONG THE STREET CROWDS THAN THERE HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE A WHOLE CROP OF NEW APPEALS AGAINST INSURRECTION HAD BLOSSOMED OUT ON THE WALLS DURING THE NIGHT TO THE PEASANTS TO THE SOLDIERS AT THE FRONT TO THE WORKMEN OF PETROGRAD
SLOWLY FROM THE GREAT SQUARE EBBED THE PROLETARIAN TIDE I SUDDENLY REALISED THAT THE DEVOUT RUSSIAN PEOPLE NO LONGER NEEDED PRIESTS TO PRAY THEM INTO HEAVEN
ABSURD I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE EVEN FIGHTING AMONG THEMSELVES AT SMOLNY A SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARY FRIEND OF MINE DREW ME ASIDE
KNOTS OF CREPE HANGING FROM THE TOP AND SOME ANARCHIST FLAGS BLACK WITH WHITE LETTERS THE BAND WAS PLAYING THE REVOLUTIONARY FUNERAL MARCH AND AGAINST THE IMMENSE SINGING OF THE MASS OF PEOPLE
STANDING UNCOVERED THE PARADERS SANG HOARSELY CHOKED WITH SOBS BETWEEN THE FACTORY WORKERS CAME COMPANIES OF SOLDIERS WITH THEIR COFFINS TOO AND SQUADRONS OF CAVALRY RIDING AT SALUTE AND ARTILLERY BATTERIES
THEY WERE DELIGHTED TO MEET AN AMERICAN REPORTER WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF GUSTO BOTH SAID THAT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE SHOT IF THE BOLSHEVIKI CAUGHT THEM
WITH POLITE AND FRIENDLY APOLOGIES THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO LEAVE SHORTLY AFTERWARD WE HEARD THEM BREAKING INTO A COMPARTMENT OCCUPIED BY TWO STOUT WELL DRESSED RUSSIANS WHO HAD BRIBED THE CONDUCTOR AND LOCKED THEIR DOOR
ONE BY ONE THE FIVE HUNDRED COFFINS WERE LAID IN THE PITS DUSK FELL AND STILL THE BANNERS CAME DROOPING AND FLUTTERING THE BAND PLAYED THE FUNERAL MARCH AND THE HUGE ASSEMBLAGE CHANTED
THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER THIRTIETH TO THIRTY FIRST WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY THE ATTEMPT OF KERENSKY TO MOVE COUNTER REVOLUTIONARY TROOPS AGAINST THE CAPITAL OF THE REVOLUTION HAS BEEN DECISIVELY REPULSED KERENSKY IS RETREATING WE ARE ADVANCING
SMARTLY DRESSED WOMEN SCREAMED EPITHETS THE SOLDIERS ARGUED FEEBLY WITH EMBARRASSED GRINS ARMOURED CARS WENT UP AND DOWN THE STREET NAMED AFTER THE FIRST TSARS OLEG RURIK SVIETOSLAV
HE HAD LEFT THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS HE HAD DESERTED HIS POST WHILE THE BATTLE WAS RAGING AS FOR THE BOURGEOIS PRESS HERE IN MOSCOW THERE WAS NO MORE BOURGEOIS PRESS EVEN THE CITY DUMA HAD BEEN DISSOLVED
WHERE ALL THE ARMY COMMITTEES CONSIDER THAT THE TAKING OF POWER BY THE SOVIETS ONLY THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY IS A STAB IN THE BACK OF THE ARMY AND A CRIME AGAINST THE PEOPLE SHOUTS OF LIE YOU LIE
AND THERE IS A DECREE JUST OUT ORDERING THE PRIVATE BANKS TO OPEN TO MORROW OR WE WILL OPEN THEM OURSELVES THE PETROGRAD SOVIET WAS IN FULL SWING THRONGED WITH ARMED MEN TROTZKY REPORTING
WHAT DO THE SOLDIERS SAY ABOUT IT JEERS AND HOOTS WE THE FRONT GROUP
EXPEDITIONS OF SAILORS HEAVILY ARMED WERE SENT OUT IN GROUPS OF FIVE THOUSAND TO THE SOUTH TO SIBERIA WITH ROVING COMMISSIONS TO CAPTURE CITIES STILL HELD BY THE WHITE GUARDS ESTABLISH ORDER AND GET FOOD
OUR BROTHERS ARE BEING SHOT DOWN IN THE STREETS AT THIS MOMENT WHEN BEFORE THE OPENING OF THE CONGRESS OF SOVIETS THE QUESTION OF POWER IS BEING SETTLED BY MEANS OF A MILITARY PLOT
AROUND IN FRONT STOOD A LITTLE GREY MOUSTACHED MAN IN THE UNIFORM OF A GENERAL THE CENTRE OF A KNOT OF SOLDIERS HE WAS VERY RED IN THE FACE I AM GENERAL ALEXEYEV HE CRIED
AND IF SHE DOESN'T ASK ABOUT THEM THE NEXT TIME SHE COMES I'LL BURN THEM ROBERT MUST GO AFTER HER EVERY FRIDAY EVENING AND WE'LL KEEP HER UNTIL MONDAY AND DO ALL WE CAN TO CHEER HER
SUDDENLY NANCY ELLEN BEGAN TO CRY BITTERLY BETWEEN SOBS SHE COULD HEAR KATE AS SHE WALKED FROM CLOSET AND BUREAU
ADAM AND MILLY ARE GOING TO COME IN SOON I'M ALMOST SURE AT LEAST HE IS WILLING I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT I AM TO DO BUT I SUPPOSE THEY WILL GIVE ME MY WORK SOON
SHE WALKED FROM THE HOUSE HEAD ERECT SHOULDERS SQUARED AND SO DOWN THE STREET FROM SIGHT IN HALF AN HOUR A TRUCKMAN CAME FOR HER TRUNK
YOU GO ON AND TEACH THIS YEAR
SHE CLOSED HER EYES LEANED AGAINST A BIG TREE AND SLOW COLD AND HOT SHUDDERS ALTERNATED IN SHAKING HER FRAME
SHE COULD HEAR GEORGE'S RINGING LAUGH OF EXULTATION BREAKING OUT AFRESH EVERY FEW MINUTES
I'VE ALWAYS HAD TO WORK JUST AS YOU'VE SEEN ME LAST SUMMER AND THIS SO I COULDN'T EDUCATE MYSELF SO FAST
KATE YOU ARE MAKING THIS PLACE LOOK FINE I USED TO SAY I'D RATHER DIE THAN COME BACK HERE TO LIVE BUT LATELY IT HAS BEEN GROWING SO ATTRACTIVE I'VE BEEN HERE ABOUT HALF MY TIME AND WISHED I WERE THE OTHER HALF
MISSUS WHISTLER TOLD ROBERT WHEN SHE CALLED HIM IN ABOUT HER SIDE TUESDAY I CAN'T IMAGINE A BATES JOINING CHURCH IF THAT IS JOINING CHURCH IT'S THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD SAID KATE WE JUST LOVED DOING IT DIDN'T WE LITTLE POLL
ALL I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR TROUBLE IS WHETHER THERE IS ANYTHING A MAN OF MY SIZE AND STRENGTH CAN DO TO HELP YOU NOT A THING SAID KATE IN THE DIRECTION OF SLAYING A GAY DECEIVER
MARRYING YOU IN HIS LAKE SHORE PALACE NO DOUBT WELL IF THAT'S WHAT HE MEANS BY A DELUGE SAID KATE HE'LL FIND THE FLOOD COMING HIS WAY
I THINK THERE WAS A LITTLE TOUCH OF ASPERITY AS AGATHA WOULD SAY IN THAT SAID NANCY ELLEN BUT KATE HAS A GOOD HEART SHE'LL GET OVER IT BEFORE MORNING
I THINK KATE I'M VERY CLOSE IF I AM NOT REALLY WHERE YOU ARE THIS MINUTE SHE SAID THEN SHE STARTED HER CAR BUT SHE LOOKED BACK WAVING AND SMILING UNTIL THE CAR SWERVED SO THAT KATE CALLED AFTER HER DO DRIVE CAREFULLY NANCY ELLEN
SAW THE BOY TURN IN AT THE GATE FRIDAY MORNING EACH SAW THAT HE CARRIED MORE THAN ONE LETTER NANCY ELLEN WAS ON HER FEET AND NEARER TO THE DOOR SHE STEPPED TO IT AND TOOK THE LETTERS
HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT PROVING IT KATE HE ASKED WHY THIS WAY SAID KATE LEANING TO STRAIGHTEN AND ARRANGE THE DELICATE VELVET PETALLED ROSES WITH HER SURE WORK ABUSED FINGERS TAKE THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD
SHE BEGAN TO RESENT THE LENGTH OF TIME HE WAS WAITING IT WAS LIKE HIM TO WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE AND THEN DEPEND ON MONEY TO CARRY HIM THROUGH HE IS GIVING ME A LONG TIME TO THINK THINGS OVER
CHAPTER TWELVE TWO LETTERS NANCY ELLEN AND ROBERT WERE SITTING ON THE SIDE PORCH NOT SEEMING IN THE LEAST SLEEPY WHEN KATE ENTERED THE HOUSE AS SHE STEPPED OUT TO THEM SHE FOUND THEM LAUGHING MYSTERIOUSLY
AND GO AWAY UNTIL SCHOOL BEGINS AND FORGET HIM HAVING A GOOD TIME BY OURSELVES COME ON KATE LET'S DO IT WE CAN GO STAY WITH AUNT OLLIE AND IF HE COMES TRYING TO FORCE HIMSELF ON YOU HE'LL GET WHAT HE DESERVES
HAVE HIM BRING WHAT HE MIGHT NEED TO HOWE'S AND HURRY RUSH HIM THEN SHE RAN TO HER BELL AND RANG SO FRANTICALLY THAT ADAM CAME RUNNING KATE WAS AT THE LITTLE GARAGE THEY HAD BUILT AND HAD THE DOOR OPEN
BUT I'LL READ IT IF YOU WANT ME TO OFFERED NANCY ELLEN ALL RIGHT GO AHEAD SAID KATE IT MIGHT POSSIBLY TEACH YOU THAT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS JUDGE A MAN BY APPEARANCE OR HASTILY
KATE SAID TO NANCY ELLEN WHEN THERE WAS NO LETTER IN THE AFTERNOON MAIL THURSDAY IT MAY HAVE BEEN LOST OR DELAYED SAID NANCY ELLEN IT WILL COME TO MORROW SURELY BOTH OF THEM
BUT IT HURT TERRIBLY LET ME TELL YOU THAT GEORGE HOLT SUDDENLY AROSE AND WENT TO KATE HE SAT DOWN CLOSE BESIDE HER AND LEANED TOWARD HER
SHE WOULD JOIN IN WHATEVER EFFORT THE CHURCH WAS MAKING TO HOLD AND INCREASE ITS MEMBERSHIP AMONG THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND TO RAISE FUNDS TO KEEP UP THE ORGANIZATION ALL THE TIME HER MIND WAS BUSY THINKING OUT THESE FINE RESOLVES
WITH NO HELP AT ALL SHE SAID I'VE DONE MY BEST IN THE PAST
GEORGE HOLT HAD TAUGHT SEVERAL TERMS OF COUNTRY SCHOOL AND TAUGHT THEM WITH MUCH SUCCESS
WHERE SHE SAT IN THE DEEP GRASS AND LOOKED AT THOSE THREE LONG MOUNDS AND TRIED TO UNDERSTAND LIFE DEEPER STILL TO FATHOM DEATH SHE AND HER MOTHER HAD AGREED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NOW KATE TRIED AS NEVER BEFORE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT AND WHERE
IF SHE DIDN'T STEP UP AND KISS HIM NEVER AGAIN SHALL I TRUST MY EYES SAID THE DOCTOR HUSH CAUTIONED NANCY ELLEN SHE'S PROVOKED NOW IF SHE HEARS THAT SHE'LL NEVER FORGIVE US
AND DOWN TO THE ICE OF THE SOUTHERN POLE AGAIN AND IN BLACKEST AFRICA FARTHEST WILDEST BORNEO YOU WILL NEVER DISCOVER ONE SINGLE TRIBE OF CREATURES UPRIGHT AND BELONGING TO THE RACE OF MAN
SHE TOLD HIM WHAT SHE HAD HEARD RAN TO GET THE BABY AND MET HIM AT THE GATE ON THE WAY SHE SAID YOU TAKE THE BABY WHEN WE GET THERE AND IF I'M NEEDED TAKE HER BACK AND GET MILLY AND HER MOTHER TO COME STAY WITH YOU YOU KNOW WHERE HER THINGS ARE AND HOW TO FEED HER
MY DEREST KATE
WE HAVE ADVANCED TO SOMETHING BETTER THAN TOM TOMS AND POW WOWS FOR MUSIC AND DANCE THESE DESIRES ARE FULFILLED BEFORE US NOW TELL ME WHY THE VERY STRONGEST OF ALL THE MOST DEEPLY ROOTED THE BELIEF IN AFTER LIFE SHOULD COME TO NOTHING
AND SOME ROADSIDE ASTERS SHE HAD GATHERED IN PASSING SHE SAT IN DEEP THOUGHT WHEN A CAR STOPPED ON THE ROAD KATE LOOKED UP TO SEE ROBERT COMING ACROSS THE CHURCHYARD WITH HIS ARMS FULL OF GREENHOUSE ROSES
WHAT A MAN CANNOT DO I STILL BELIEVE IN THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL OH YES SAID KATE IF THERE IS ANY SUCH THING IN SCIENCE AS A SELF EVIDENT FACT THAT IS ONE THAT IS PROVABLE ROBERT LOOKED AT HER EAGER FACE
SO THEY WELCOMED HER AND PRAISED THE BEAUTY AND SWEETNESS OF THE BABY UNTIL KATE WENT OUT INTO THE SUNSHINE HER FACE GLOWING SLOWLY SHE WALKED HOME AND AS SHE REACHED THE VERANDA ADAM TOOK THE BABY BEEN TO THE CEMETERY HE ASKED
IF I CAN POSSIBLY AVOID IT SECOND I'M GOING TO SEND A DRAYMAN TO GET MY TRUNK AND TAKE IT TO WALDEN THIRD I'M GOING TO START OUT AND WALK MILES
WITH THE RICH NEW FRIENDS YOU'D MADE I WAS WATCHING FOR YOU ABOUT THIS TIME AND I JUST HAPPENED TO BE AT THE STATION IN HARTLEY LAST SATURDAY WHEN YOU GOT OFF THE TRAIN WITH YOUR FINE GENTLEMAN
HE GOT IT FIGHTING FOR HIS MOTHER FROM BOYHOOD HE KNEW SHE WOULD FREEZE AND STARVE IF HE DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF HER HE HAD TO DO IT HE SOON FOUND HE COULD IT TOOK MONEY TO DO WHAT HE HAD TO DO
WHO DID NOT COME INTO THE WORLD WITH FOUR PRIMAL INSTINCTS THEY ALL REPRODUCE THEMSELVES THEY ALL MAKE SOMETHING INTENDED FOR MUSIC THEY ALL EXPRESS A FEELING IN THEIR HEARTS BY THE EXERCISE WE CALL DANCE THEY ALL BELIEVE IN THE AFTER LIFE OF THE SOUL
SHE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF PROBATIONS AND EXAMINATIONS AND CATECHISMS SHE HAD READ THE BIBLE AS WAS THE CUSTOM EVERY MORNING BEFORE HER SCHOOL IN THAT BOOK WHEN A MAN WANTED TO FOLLOW JESUS HE FOLLOWED
SO I STAYED OVER WITH SOME FRIENDS OF MINE AND I SAW YOU SEVERAL TIMES SUNDAY I SAW THAT I'D PRACTICALLY NO CHANCE WITH YOU AT ALL BUT I MADE UP MY MIND
SHE PAID THE DRAYMAN OPENED HER TRUNK AND PUT AWAY HER DRESSES LAYING OUT ALL THE THINGS WHICH NEEDED WASHING
SAID KATE AS FOR THIS I NEVER WAS SO AFRAID IN ALL MY LIFE LOOK AT THAT SHE THREW THE ENVELOPE IN NANCY ELLEN'S LAP THAT IS THE VERY FIRST LINE OF JOHN JARDINE'S WRITING
HE NEVER DID NO I HAVEN'T AN IDEA WHAT HE HAS IN HIS MIND YET BUT HE'S GOING TO WRITE ME ABOUT IT THIS WEEK AND IF I AGREE TO WHATEVER IT IS HE IS COMING SUNDAY
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN THE EXTENT OF MY FAMILIARITIES WITH JOHN JARDINE
WHILE TWO MEN AND A WOMAN WERE CARRYING A LIMP FORM ACROSS THE MEADOW TOWARD THE HOUSE AS THEIR CAR STOPPED KATE KISSED THE BABY MECHANICALLY HANDED HER TO ADAM AND RAN INTO THE HOUSE WHERE SHE DRAGGED A COUCH TO THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRST ROOM SHE ENTERED
YES SAID KATE RECOGNIZING A NEIGHBOUR LIVING A FEW MILES DOWN THE ROAD DID NANCY ELLEN JUST LEAVE YOUR HOUSE CAME A BREATHLESS QUERY YES SAID KATE AGAIN I JUST SAW A CAR THAT LOOKED LIKE HERS SLIP IN THE FRESH SAND AT THE RIVER LEVEE
HE DOESN'T SAY ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY MISTAKES I HAVEN'T YET HEARD HIM TALK FREELY GIVE AN OPINION OR DISCUSS A QUESTION SAID NANCY ELLEN NEITHER HAVE I
OR YOU NEVER WOULD BE GOING TO CHICAGO AFTER THIS LITTLE MOTHERLESS CHILD YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD BUT I KNOW FROM THE JOY OF YOU AND ROBERT DURING THE PAST MONTHS THAT MISSUS SOUTHEY ISN'T TROUBLING YOU ANY MORE AND I'M SURE ENOUGH TO PUT IT INTO WORDS
AFTER A PAGE AS SHE TURNED THE SECOND SHEET NANCY ELLEN GLANCED AT KATE AND SAW THAT SHE HAD NOT OPENED THE CREASED PAGE IN HER HANDS SHE FLAMED WITH SUDDEN IRRITATION YOU DO BEAT THE BAND SHE CRIED
YOU BORE THOSE THINGS LIKE A STOIC WHEN THEY ARE ALL OVER AND YOU ARE COMFORTABLE AND HAPPY JUST THE JOY OF BEING SURE OF LITTLE POLL HAS TRANSFORMED YOU KATE YOU MAKE ME THINK OF THE WINGED VICTORY THIS AFTERNOON
FROM THE GENTLEMAN SHE GLANCED AT THE STAMPING AND ADDRESSES AND SMILED AGAIN SO IT PROVES SHE SAID WHILE I'M ABOUT IT I'LL SEE WHAT THE CLOD HOPPER HAS TO SAY
THAT WHEN YOU GET YOUR LITTLE CHILD SHE WILL LEAD YOU STRAIGHT WHERE MINE AS LED ME GOOD BYE AND GOOD LUCK TO YOU AND REMEMBER ME TO ROBERT NANCY ELLEN STOOD INTENTLY STUDYING THE PICTURE SHE HELD IN HER HAND THEN SHE LOOKED AT KATE SMILING WITH MISTY EYES
WHEN SHE FINISHED SHE GLANCED AT NANCY ELLEN WHILE SLOWLY FOLDING THE SHEETS JUST FOR HALF A CENT I'D ASK YOU TO READ THIS SHE SAID
IMPULSIVE AS SHE IS AND SELF CONFIDENT OF COURSE SHE WOULDN'T BUT YOU NEVER CAN TELL WHAT KIND OF FOOL A GIRL WILL MAKE OF HERSELF IN SOME CASES
I'M SURE MILLY WILL BE JOINING VERY SOON AND THAT SHE'LL WANT YOU WITH HER SAID KATE SHE WAS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL WOMAN BUT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THAT DAY SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS MOVING WITH WINGED FEET
A U G H H A R T D O U T D E R E SHE SLOWLY SPELLED OUT THE LETTERS
I'D STICK UNTIL I SAW YOU MARRY HIM SO I WROTE JUST AS I WOULD IF I HADN'T KNOWN THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN IN EXISTENCE THAT WAS A VERY FINE LETTER SAID KATE IT IS A VERY FINE
KATE TURNED AND PLACING THE BABY ON THE FRONT SEAT SHE KNELT AND PUT HER ARMS AROUND THE LITTLE THING BUT HER LIPS ONLY REPEATED THE WORDS PRAISE THE LORD FOR THIS PRECIOUS BABY HER HEART WAS FILLED WITH HIGH RESOLVE SHE WOULD REAR THE BABY WITH SUCH CARE
THE MOST DESIRABLE THING THE MOST EXPENSIVE I ALMOST PRAYED SOMETIMES THAT IN SOME WAY HE WOULD STRIKE ONE SINGLE THING THAT HE COULDN'T MAKE COME HIS WAY WITH MONEY BUT
I HAVE EVER SEEN SHE SAID DO YOU SEE ANYTHING ABOUT IT TO ENCOURAGE ME TO GO FARTHER YOU GOOSE CRIED THE EXASPERATED NANCY ELLEN
BUT IT WAS A WHOLE LOT OF FEELING OF SOME KIND I WAS SATISFIED WITH IT AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN I MEANT TO BE A GOOD WIFE TO HIM AND A GOOD DAUGHTER TO HIS MOTHER
TAKE THIS CHAIR KATE SAID NANCY ELLEN COME ON ROBERT LET'S GO STAND UNDER THE MAPLE TREE AND LET HER SEE WHETHER SHE CAN SEE US IF YOU'RE GOING TO REHEARSE ANY MOMENTOUS MOMENT OF YOUR EXISTENCE SAID KATE
AND WHATEVER I DO IT IS ALL FOR YOU AND YOURS FOR THE TAKING HE SAID GRANDIOSELY THANK YOU SAID KATE BUT ARE YOU MAKING THAT OFFER WHEN YOU CAN'T HELP SEEING THAT I'M IN DEEP TROUBLE
SHE READ THEM SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY SOMETIMES TURNING BACK A PAGE AND GOING OVER A PART OF IT AGAIN
OR AT ADAM'S OR BEFORE A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE IF NEITHER OF YOU WANTS ME HE CAN'T PICK ME UP AND CARRY ME AWAY AND DRESS ME AND MARRY ME AS IF I WERE A PAUPER
HIS MOTHER HAS TOLD ME MINUTELY OF HIS LIFE EVERY DAY SINCE HE WAS BORN I THINK SHE INSISTS THAT HE NEVER PAID THE SLIGHTEST ATTENTION TO A GIRL BEFORE AND HE SAYS THE SAME SO
SHE WAS LEANING OVER THE FLOWERS ABSORBED IN THEIR BEAUTY KATE SAT LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HER UNTIL TIME TO HELP WITH THE EVENING WORK AND PREPARE SUPPER THEN SHE AROSE SHE STOOD LOOKING DOWN A LONG TIME
SAID KATE ARE YOU SURPRISED TO SEE ME NO HE ANSWERED AFTER LAST YEAR WE FIGURED YOU MIGHT COME THE LAST OF THIS WEEK OR THE FIRST OF NEXT SO WE GOT YOUR ROOM READY MONDAY
AT LAST SHE ROUSED HERSELF AND AGAIN LOOKED AT HIM I HAD YOUR LETTER THIS MORNING SHE SAID I WAS WONDERING ABOUT THAT HE REPLIED YES I GOT IT JUST BEFORE I STARTED
SHE DREW FORTH THE SHEET AND SAT AN INSTANT WITH IT IN HER FINGERS WATCHING THE EXPRESSION OF NANCY ELLEN'S FACE WHILE SHE READ THE MOST RESTRAINED YET IMPASSIONED PLEA
THE NEIGHBOURS SILENTLY BEGAN TAKING AWAY THINGS THAT HAD BEEN USED WHILE MISSUS HOWE CHOSE HER WHITEST SHEET AND LAID IT ON A CHAIR NEAR ROBERT TWO DAYS LATER THEY LAID NANCY ELLEN BESIDE HER MOTHER THEN THEY BEGAN TRYING TO FACE THE PROBLEM OF LIFE WITHOUT HER
BUT I MUST TEACH TO THE EARN MONEY FOR MY OUTFIT I'LL HAVE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL IN THE SAME OLD SAILOR DON'T YOU CARE LAUGHED NANCY ELLEN WE KNOW A SECRET THAT WE DO
THEN HE HAS THREATENED ME WITH A DELUGE WHATEVER HE MEANS BY THAT HE MEANS PROVIDING ANOTHER TEACHER FOR WALDEN TAKING YOU TO CHICAGO SHOPPING FOR A WONDERFUL TROUSSEAU
THOUGH JUST WHY GEORGE HOLT LOOKS MORE LIKE A CLOD HOPPER
HE CARRIED A BIG BUNCH OF DEEP RED FOR HER MOTHER WHITE FOR POLLY AND A LARGE SHEAF OF WARM PINK FOR NANCY ELLEN KATE KNELT UP AND TAKING HER FLOWERS SHE MOVED THEM LOWER AND SILENTLY HELPED ROBERT PLACE THOSE HE HAD BROUGHT
KATE SAT STARING DOWN THE ROAD SHE WAS SHOCKED SPEECHLESS AGAIN SHE HAD FOLLOWED AN IMPULSE WITHOUT THINKING OF ANY ONE BESIDES HERSELF USUALLY SHE COULD TALK BUT IN THAT INSTANT SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
AND IT WENT DOWN AND TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER O GOD SAID KATE THEN AFTER AN INSTANT
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WITH THE FACT THAT HE ENTERS THIS WORLD WITH BELIEF IN AFTER LIFE OF SOME KIND WE SEE MATERIAL EVIDENCE IN INCREASE THAT MAN IS NOT DEFEATED IN HIS DESIRE TO REPRODUCE HIMSELF
SHE WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL WITH ADAM SHE WOULD MAKE HEROIC EFFORT TO HELP HIM TO CLEAN UNASHAMED MANHOOD SHE WOULD BE A BETTER SISTER TO ALL HER FAMILY SHE WOULD BE FRIENDLIER AND HAVE MORE PATIENCE WITH THE NEIGHBOURS
WOULD AGATHA USE SUCH A COMMON WORD AS LITTLE ASKED ROBERT INDEED NO SAID NANCY ELLEN SHE WOULD SAY INFINITESIMAL BUT ALL THE SAME HE KISSED HER
DELIBERATELY SET HER FOOT ON IT AND LEAVING THE ROOM CLIMBED THE STAIRS NANCY ELLEN THREW GEORGE HOLT'S LETTER ASIDE AND SNATCHED UP JOHN JARDINE'S
WE HAD SIX LONG LOVELY WEEKS OF DAILY ASSOCIATION AT THE LAKE I'VE SEEN HIS HOME AND HIS INVENTIONS AND AS MUCH OF HIS BUSINESS AS IS VISIBLE TO THE EYE OF A WOMAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW A TINKER ABOUT BUSINESS
WILL YOU MARRY ME AS I UNDERSTAND IT SAME HERE LAUGHED KATE HE SAID HE HAD TO BE SURE ABOUT HIS MOTHER AND THERE WAS ONE OTHER THING HE'D WRITE ME ABOUT THIS WEEK AND HE'D COME AGAIN NEXT SUNDAY
THEREFORE THE INTELLECT OF GOD IN SO FAR AS IT IS CONCEIVED TO CONSTITUTE THE DIVINE ESSENCE DIFFERS FROM OUR INTELLECT BOTH IN RESPECT TO ESSENCE AND IN RESPECT TO EXISTENCE NOR CAN IT IN ANYWISE AGREE THEREWITH SAVE IN NAME
AND THE FACULTY OF FORMING CONCEPTIONS NOR DO I SEE WHY THE FACULTY OF VOLITION SHOULD BE CALLED INFINITE ANY MORE THAN THE FACULTY OF FEELING FOR AS WE ARE ABLE BY THE SAME FACULTY OF VOLITION TO AFFIRM AN INFINITE NUMBER OF THINGS
WITH DRESS WITH MUSIC WITH MANY SPORTS WITH THEATRES AND THE LIKE SUCH AS EVERY MAN MAY MAKE USE OF WITHOUT INJURY TO HIS NEIGHBOUR FOR THE HUMAN BODY IS COMPOSED OF VERY NUMEROUS PARTS OF DIVERSE NATURE
THAT WHICH NECESSARILY EXISTS IS NOTHING BUT FINITE BEINGS SUCH FINITE BEINGS ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN A BEING ABSOLUTELY INFINITE WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY ABSURD THEREFORE EITHER NOTHING EXISTS
SUCH ARE THE DICTATES OF REASON WHICH I PURPOSED THUS BRIEFLY TO INDICATE BEFORE BEGINNING TO PROVE THEM IN GREATER DETAIL I HAVE TAKEN THIS COURSE IN ORDER IF POSSIBLE TO GAIN THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE PRINCIPLE THAT EVERY MAN
NOTE SOME ASSERT THAT GOD LIKE A MAN CONSISTS OF BODY AND MIND AND IS SUSCEPTIBLE OF PASSIONS
THEY THUS REGARD IDEAS AS THOUGH THEY WERE INANIMATE PICTURES ON A PANEL AND FILLED WITH THIS MISCONCEPTION DO NOT SEE THAT AN IDEA INASMUCH AS IT IS AN IDEA
AND AS NO ONE ENDEAVOURS TO PRESERVE HIS OWN BEING EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF HIS OWN NATURE IT FOLLOWS FIRST THAT THE FOUNDATION OF VIRTUE IS THE ENDEAVOUR TO PRESERVE ONE'S OWN BEING AND THAT HAPPINESS CONSISTS
AS THAT WHEREBY I HAVE HITHERTO PROCEEDED
BE UNDERSTOOD SOLELY THROUGH HUMAN NATURE AS ITS PROXIMATE CAUSE BUT SINCE EVERY MAN BY THE LAWS OF HIS NATURE DESIRES THAT WHICH HE DEEMS GOOD AND ENDEAVOURS TO REMOVE THAT WHICH HE DEEMS BAD
COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT IN PROPORTION AS A THING IS IN HARMONY WITH OUR NATURE SO IS IT MORE USEFUL OR BETTER FOR US AND VICE VERSA IN PROPORTION AS A THING IS MORE USEFUL FOR US
IT WILL HAVE THE IDEA OF THE MODE AS ACTUALLY EXISTING
WILL PERFORCE CONSIST OF A DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTE SO THAT IN THAT CASE
WHEREFORE THE EXISTENCE OF SUBSTANCE MUST ARISE SOLELY FROM ITS OWN NATURE WHICH IS NOTHING ELSE BUT ITS ESSENCE
BUT I SHOULD HERE ALSO REMARK THAT WE CAN ONLY DISTINCTLY CONCEIVE DISTANCE OF SPACE OR TIME UP TO A CERTAIN DEFINITE LIMIT THAT IS
AND CONSEQUENTLY
WHICH OF THE EMOTIONS ARE IN HARMONY WITH THE RULES OF HUMAN REASON
DESIRE ARISING FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL IN SO FAR AS SUCH KNOWLEDGE REGARDS WHAT IS FUTURE MAY BE MORE EASILY CONTROLLED OR QUENCHED THAN THE DESIRE FOR WHAT IS AGREEABLE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT PROOF
THE IDEA OF EVERY MODE IN WHICH THE HUMAN BODY IS AFFECTED BY EXTERNAL BODIES
INASMUCH AS WE HAVE SELECTED IT AT RANDOM MAY BE SAID OF ANY OTHER VOLITION
NOTE WE THUS SEE HOW IT COMES ABOUT
BUT BY ACCIDENT SIX WHAT I MEAN BY EMOTION FELT TOWARDS A THING FUTURE PRESENT AND PAST
AND CONTINUALLY AFFECTED BY EXTERNAL BODIES MANY ERRORS IN TRUTH CAN BE TRACED TO THIS HEAD
RATHER THAN AN ACTUAL MAN IF I SAY THAT HE WOULD NOT HE WOULD THEN DETERMINE HIS OWN ACTION AND WOULD CONSEQUENTLY POSSESS THE FACULTY OF GOING AND DOING WHATEVER HE LIKED OTHER OBJECTIONS MIGHT ALSO BE RAISED
AND THE MAN REJOICES AFRESH AS OFTEN AS THE REPETITION TAKES PLACE THIS IS THE CAUSE OF MEN'S PLEASURE IN RECALLING PAST EVILS AND DELIGHT IN NARRATING DANGERS FROM WHICH THEY HAVE ESCAPED FOR WHEN MEN CONCEIVE A DANGER THEY CONCEIVE IT AS STILL FUTURE AND ARE DETERMINED TO FEAR IT
IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THAT ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS
THIS WILL BE PLAIN ENOUGH TO ALL WHO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE INTELLECT AND THE IMAGINATION ESPECIALLY IF IT BE REMEMBERED THAT MATTER IS EVERYWHERE THE SAME THAT ITS PARTS ARE NOT DISTINGUISHABLE EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS WE CONCEIVE MATTER AS DIVERSELY MODIFIED
IN SO FAR AS THIS IS UNDERSTOOD BY ITS NATURE TO BE INCREASED OR DIMINISHED LASTLY BY PERFECTION IN GENERAL I SHALL AS I HAVE SAID MEAN REALITY IN OTHER WORDS
BUT IGNORANT OF THE CAUSES WHEREBY THEY ARE DETERMINED TO ANY PARTICULAR DESIRE THEREFORE THE COMMON SAYING THAT NATURE SOMETIMES FALLS SHORT OR BLUNDERS
IF GOD WISHED TO BRING IT ABOUT THAT WE SHOULD PERCEIVE THEM HE WOULD BE OBLIGED TO ENDOW US WITH A GREATER FACULTY OF PERCEPTION BUT NOT A GREATER FACULTY OF VOLITION THAN WE HAVE ALREADY
MAY BE CHANGED INTO SOMETHING ELSE CAPABLE OF VERY MANY ACTIVITIES AND REFERABLE TO A MIND WHICH IS HIGHLY CONSCIOUS OF ITSELF OF GOD AND OF THINGS
VIRTUE IS HUMAN POWER WHICH IS DEFINED SOLELY BY MAN'S ESSENCE
COMMON OR UNIVERSAL TO ALL VOLITIONS IS A FACULTY IT IS LITTLE TO BE WONDERED AT THAT THEY ASSERT THAT SUCH A FACULTY EXTENDS ITSELF INTO THE INFINITE BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE UNDERSTANDING
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE SAY THAT TO BE INHABITED IS THE FINAL CAUSE OF THIS OR THAT HOUSE WE MEAN NOTHING MORE THAN THAT A MAN CONCEIVING THE CONVENIENCES OF HOUSEHOLD LIFE HAD A DESIRE TO BUILD A HOUSE WHEREFORE
WHICH CONTINUALLY STAND IN NEED OF FRESH AND VARIED NOURISHMENT SO THAT THE WHOLE BODY MAY BE EQUALLY CAPABLE OF PERFORMING ALL THE ACTIONS
AND IT IS THE HEIGHT OF ABSURDITY TO PREDICATE SUCH A THING OF GOD A BEING ABSOLUTELY INFINITE BUT MEANWHILE BY OTHER REASONS WITH WHICH THEY TRY TO PROVE THEIR POINT
OR WILL NECESSARILY BE IN DOUBT ON THE SUBJECT I THINK THAT I HAVE ANTICIPATED MY ANSWER TO THE THIRD OBJECTION NAMELY THAT THE WILL IS SOMETHING UNIVERSAL WHICH IS PREDICATED OF ALL IDEAS
THAN UNDER COMPULSION FROM EXTERNAL CAUSES SHRINKS FROM FOOD OR KILLS HIMSELF WHICH LATTER MAY BE DONE IN A VARIETY OF WAYS A MAN FOR INSTANCE KILLS HIMSELF UNDER THE COMPULSION OF ANOTHER MAN WHO TWISTS ROUND HIS RIGHT HAND
PROOF ALL THE MODES IN WHICH ANY GIVEN BODY IS AFFECTED
AT ANY RATE IT CAUSES THEM TO OCCUPY A VERY SMALL PART OF THE MIND
COROLLARY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IN SO FAR AS HE LOVES HIMSELF LOVES MAN AND CONSEQUENTLY
THAT GOD IS ABSOLUTELY THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THOSE THINGS IMMEDIATELY PRODUCED BY HIM I SAY ABSOLUTELY NOT AFTER HIS KIND
AS THEIR DEFINITIONS ALREADY GIVEN SHOW NOW BY PAIN WE MEAN THAT THE MIND'S POWER OF THINKING IS DIMINISHED OR CHECKED
BY NATURE VIEWED AS PASSIVE I UNDERSTAND ALL THAT WHICH FOLLOWS FROM THE NECESSITY OF THE NATURE OF GOD OR OF ANY OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD THAT IS ALL THE MODES OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF GOD IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE CONSIDERED AS THINGS WHICH ARE IN GOD
NEITHER CAN IT BE DEFILED WITH THOSE FAULTS WHICH ARE INHERENT IN ORDINARY LOVE BUT IT MAY GROW FROM STRENGTH TO STRENGTH AND MAY ENGROSS THE GREATER PART OF THE MIND AND DEEPLY PENETRATE IT
AT ALL FOLLOW FROM THE NOTION OF AN INFINITE QUANTITY BUT MERELY FROM THE NOTION THAT AN INFINITE QUANTITY IS MEASURABLE AND COMPOSED OF FINITE PARTS THEREFORE THE ONLY FAIR CONCLUSION TO BE DRAWN IS THAT INFINITE QUANTITY
PROOF A MAN FOR INSTANCE PETER CAN BE THE CAUSE OF PAUL'S FEELING PAIN BECAUSE HE PETER POSSESSES SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH PAUL HATES
OF ALL SHOULD FORM AS IT WERE ONE SINGLE MIND AND ONE SINGLE BODY AND THAT ALL SHOULD WITH ONE CONSENT AS FAR AS THEY ARE ABLE ENDEAVOUR TO PRESERVE THEIR BEING AND ALL WITH ONE CONSENT SEEK WHAT IS USEFUL TO THEM ALL HENCE
IS SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF ITSELF OR OF GOD OR OF THINGS
AND THAT MEN MAY BE DIFFERENTLY AFFECTED BY ONE AND THE SAME OBJECT
ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MIND IN THAT CONDITION
NOTE NO ONE THEREFORE NEGLECTS SEEKING HIS OWN GOOD OR PRESERVING HIS OWN BEING UNLESS HE BE OVERCOME BY CAUSES EXTERNAL AND FOREIGN TO HIS NATURE NO ONE I SAY FROM THE NECESSITY OF HIS OWN NATURE OR OTHERWISE
WHICH ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE MIND IN VIRTUE OF ITS UNDERSTANDING I SET DOWN TO STRENGTH OF CHARACTER FORTITUDO WHICH I DIVIDE INTO COURAGE ANIMOSITAS AND HIGHMINDEDNESS GENEROSITAS
AND NOW I HAVE FINISHED WITH ALL THAT CONCERNS THIS PRESENT LIFE
IN ORDER THAT THE FOREGOING PROPOSITION MAY BE FULLY EXPLAINED I WILL DRAW ATTENTION TO A FEW ADDITIONAL POINTS AND I WILL FURTHERMORE ANSWER THE OBJECTIONS WHICH MAY BE ADVANCED AGAINST OUR DOCTRINE LASTLY
IT FOLLOWS THEREFROM THAT A THING NECESSARILY EXISTS IF NO CAUSE OR REASON BE GRANTED WHICH PREVENTS ITS EXISTENCE IF THEN NO CAUSE OR REASON CAN BE GIVEN WHICH PREVENTS THE EXISTENCE OF GOD
THEREFORE NO PAINFUL EMOTIONS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE MIND IN VIRTUE OF ITS BEING ACTIVE BUT ONLY EMOTIONS OF PLEASURE AND DESIRE WHICH
IN OTHER WORDS TO PRESERVE HIS OWN BEING THE MORE IS HE ENDOWED WITH VIRTUE ON THE CONTRARY IN PROPORTION AS A MAN NEGLECTS TO SEEK WHAT IS USEFUL TO HIM THAT IS TO PRESERVE HIS OWN BEING HE IS WANTING IN POWER PROOF
PLEASURE AND PAIN ARE IDENTICAL WITH DESIRE OR APPETITE IN SO FAR AS BY EXTERNAL CAUSES THEY ARE INCREASED OR DIMINISHED HELPED OR HINDERED IN OTHER WORDS THEY ARE EVERY MAN'S NATURE
IS ALSO ABSURD COROLLARY IT FOLLOWS THAT NO SUBSTANCE AND CONSEQUENTLY NO EXTENDED SUBSTANCE IN SO FAR AS IT IS SUBSTANCE IS DIVISIBLE NOTE
HE WILL NECESSARILY REGARD THE HORSE AS PRESENT HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DOUBT OF ITS EXISTENCE ALTHOUGH HE BE NOT CERTAIN THEREOF WE HAVE DAILY EXPERIENCE OF SUCH A STATE OF THINGS IN DREAMS
THE WILL IS THUS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE INTELLECT
I WILL ONLY SET MYSELF TO THE TASK OF REFUTING THOSE I HAVE MENTIONED
IS INCREASED OR DIMINISHED HELPED OR HINDERED
PRECISELY IN THE QUALITY WHICH THE LATTER GAINS FROM THE FORMER FOR EXAMPLE A MAN IS THE CAUSE OF ANOTHER MAN'S EXISTENCE BUT NOT OF HIS ESSENCE FOR THE LATTER IS AN ETERNAL TRUTH AND THEREFORE
IT DETERMINES THE MAN TO REGARD THE THING WITH THE SAME PAIN AS HE WAS WONT TO DO WHEN IT ACTUALLY DID EXIST HOWEVER SINCE HE HAS JOINED TO THE IMAGE OF THE THING OTHER IMAGES WHICH EXCLUDE ITS EXISTENCE THIS DETERMINATION TO PAIN IS FORTHWITH CHECKED
ACCORDING AS HIS NATURE IS DISPOSED IN THIS OR THAT MANNER SO WILL HIS DESIRE BE OF ONE KIND OR ANOTHER
AS FROM THE NATURE OF A TRIANGLE IT FOLLOWS FROM ETERNITY AND FOR ETERNITY
THUS FAR I HAVE TREATED OF THE EMOTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO MAN IN SO FAR AS HE IS PASSIVE IT REMAINS TO ADD A FEW WORDS ON THOSE ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIM IN SO FAR AS HE IS ACTIVE
THAT IS NOTHING IN ITSELF EXTERNAL TO GOD THIS IS OUR SECOND POINT GOD THEREFORE IS THE INDWELLING AND NOT THE TRANSIENT CAUSE OF ALL THINGS
THAT IS WHICH IS DEFINED SOLELY BY THE ENDEAVOUR MADE BY MAN TO PERSIST IN HIS OWN BEING WHEREFORE THE MORE A MAN ENDEAVOURS AND IS ABLE TO PRESERVE HIS OWN BEING THE MORE IS HE ENDOWED WITH VIRTUE
THUS IN SO FAR AS WE REFER THE INDIVIDUALS IN NATURE TO THIS CATEGORY AND COMPARING THEM ONE WITH ANOTHER FIND THAT SOME POSSESS MORE OF BEING OR REALITY THAN OTHERS WE TO THIS EXTENT
MUST DIFFER FROM SUCH EFFECT BOTH IN RESPECT TO ITS ESSENCE AND ALSO IN RESPECT TO ITS EXISTENCE NOW THE INTELLECT OF GOD IS THE CAUSE BOTH OF THE ESSENCE AND THE EXISTENCE OF OUR INTELLECT
FOR I THINK THAT FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IT IS SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR THAT BY NATURE VIEWED AS ACTIVE WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT WHICH IS IN ITSELF AND IS CONCEIVED THROUGH ITSELF OR THOSE ATTRIBUTES OF SUBSTANCE WHICH EXPRESS ETERNAL AND INFINITE ESSENCE
MAKE ANY AFFIRMATION FOR WHAT IS THE PERCEPTION OF A WINGED HORSE SAVE AFFIRMING THAT A HORSE HAS WINGS IF THE MIND COULD PERCEIVE NOTHING ELSE BUT THE WINGED HORSE IT WOULD REGARD THE SAME AS PRESENT TO ITSELF
GOD HAD CREATED EVERYTHING WHICH IS IN HIS INTELLECT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CREATE ANYTHING MORE AND THIS THEY THINK WOULD CLASH WITH GOD'S OMNIPOTENCE THEREFORE THEY PREFER TO ASSET THAT GOD IS INDIFFERENT TO ALL THINGS
NOTE I SAID THAT PAUL MAY HATE PETER BECAUSE HE CONCEIVES THAT PETER POSSESSES SOMETHING WHICH HE PAUL
WITH THE EMOTION OF ANOTHER AND SEE THAT ONE MAN IS MORE TROUBLED THAN ANOTHER BY THE SAME EMOTION OR WHEN WE ARE COMPARING THE VARIOUS EMOTIONS OF THE SAME MAN ONE WITH ANOTHER
IS THE PART OF A WISE MAN I SAY IT IS THE PART OF A WISE MAN TO REFRESH AND RECREATE HIMSELF WITH MODERATE AND PLEASANT FOOD AND DRINK AND ALSO WITH PERFUMES WITH THE SOFT BEAUTY OF GROWING PLANTS
THAT GOD IS PASSIVE IN RESPECT TO ANYTHING OTHER THAN HIMSELF OR THAT EXTENDED SUBSTANCE IS UNWORTHY OF THE DIVINE NATURE EVEN IF IT BE SUPPOSED DIVISIBLE SO LONG AS IT IS GRANTED TO BE INFINITE AND ETERNAL
HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT GOD IS THE EFFICIENT CAUSE OF ALL THAT CAN FALL WITHIN THE SPHERE OF AN INFINITE INTELLECT
PROOF MIRTH
COROLLARY THE MIND IS ABLE TO REGARD AS PRESENT EXTERNAL BODIES BY WHICH THE HUMAN BODY HAS ONCE BEEN AFFECTED EVEN THOUGH THEY BE NO LONGER IN EXISTENCE OR PRESENT
BUT IF THE ESSENCE OF ONE COULD BE DESTROYED AND BE MADE FALSE THE ESSENCE OF THE OTHER WOULD BE DESTROYED ALSO WHEREFORE A THING WHICH IS THE CAUSE BOTH OF THE ESSENCE AND OF THE EXISTENCE OF A GIVEN EFFECT
IS DEFINED BY THE POWER OF AN EXTERNAL CAUSE COMPARED WITH OUR OWN
THEREFORE IT FEELS PLEASURE IN SO FAR AS IT CONCEIVES ADEQUATE IDEAS THAT IS
THAT SUICIDES ARE WEAK MINDED AND ARE OVERCOME BY EXTERNAL CAUSES REPUGNANT TO THEIR NATURE
WILL REGARD THE EXTERNAL BODY AS ACTUALLY EXISTING
WITH A SOUND MIND IN A SOUND BODY AND IN REALITY HE WHO AS IN THE CASE OF AN INFANT OR A CHILD HAS A BODY CAPABLE OF VERY FEW ACTIVITIES
GOD IS THE CAUSE OF THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE IN HIM THIS IS OUR FIRST POINT FURTHER BESIDES GOD
SUBSTANCE ABSOLUTELY INFINITE COULD CEASE TO EXIST
PROOF THE PARTS INTO WHICH SUBSTANCE AS THUS CONCEIVED WOULD BE DIVIDED EITHER WILL RETAIN THE NATURE OF SUBSTANCE OR THEY WILL NOT
ANOTHER PROOF THE POTENTIALITY OF NON EXISTENCE IS A NEGATION OF POWER AND CONTRARIWISE THE POTENTIALITY OF EXISTENCE IS A POWER AS IS OBVIOUS IF THEN
IN THIS LIFE THEREFORE WE PRIMARILY ENDEAVOUR TO BRING IT ABOUT
WHICH I HAVE STYLED KNOWLEDGE OF THE SECOND KIND
THAN THAT THE WILL OR FACULTY OF ASSENT IS FREE AND DIFFERENT FROM THE FACULTY OF UNDERSTANDING THIRDLY
WE ARE CALLED HAPPY OR UNHAPPY FOR HE WHO FROM BEING AN INFANT OR A CHILD BECOMES A CORPSE IS CALLED UNHAPPY WHEREAS IT IS SET DOWN TO HAPPINESS IF WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LIVE THROUGH THE WHOLE PERIOD OF LIFE
HE WILL ON THE OTHER HAND CALL IT PERFECT AS SOON AS HE SEES THAT IT IS CARRIED THROUGH TO THE END WHICH ITS AUTHOR HAD PURPOSED FOR IT BUT IF A MAN SEES A WORK THE LIKE WHEREOF HE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND IF HE KNOWS NOT THE INTENTION OF THE ARTIFICER
AND INVOLVES ABSOLUTE PERFECTION ALL CAUSE FOR DOUBT CONCERNING HIS EXISTENCE IS DONE AWAY AND THE UTMOST CERTAINTY ON THE QUESTION IS GIVEN THIS I THINK WILL BE EVIDENT TO EVERY MODERATELY ATTENTIVE READER
IF THE FORMER WE SHOULD HAVE SEVERAL SUBSTANCES OF THE SAME NATURE
WHY IT IS THAT THE TRUE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL STIRS UP CONFLICTS IN THE SOUL AND OFTEN YIELDS TO EVERY KIND OF PASSION
THOSE WHICH INVOLVE THE NATURE BOTH OF THE HUMAN BODY AND OF EXTERNAL BODIES I SAY SECONDLY
DOES NOT THEREFORE ADMIT THAT A WINGED HORSE EXISTS THAT IS HE IS NOT DECEIVED UNLESS HE ADMITS IN ADDITION THAT A WINGED HORSE DOES EXIST NOTHING THEREFORE SEEMS TO BE TAUGHT MORE CLEARLY BY EXPERIENCE
THAT IS THAT THE MAN HAS OFTEN HEARD THE WORD POMUM WHILE HE WAS LOOKING AT THE FRUIT
WHEREBY WE EXPLAIN ALL PARTICULAR VOLITIONS
A FIVE KOPEK PIECE THAT IS YOUR GOD BUT YOU HAVE EXPELLED YOUR CONSCIENCE LIKE THE CRY OF ISAIAH GO TO NOW YE RICH MEN WEEP AND HOWL FOR YOUR MISFORTUNES THAT SHALL COME UPON YOU IS FOMA'S YOU BLOOD SUCKERS YOU LIVE ON OTHER PEOPLE'S STRENGTH
IN PEOPLE'S EYES THE CABBAGE QUESTION NO LONGER BROODED AND THERE WAS A SPRING TO MY BODY AN ELASTICITY OF STEP AS I COVERED THE PAVEMENT WITHIN ME COURSED AN UNWONTED SAP AND I FELT AS THOUGH I WERE ABOUT TO BURST OUT INTO LEAVES AND BUDS AND GREEN THINGS
LATER HE MAY RETURN SANS GOODS CHATTELS DOORS AND WINDOWS IMPELLED BY INSATIABLE CURIOSITY FOR A LOOK SEE BUT IT IS CURIOSITY MERELY A TIMID DEERLIKE CURIOSITY
IT IS A BLOW OF THE FIST BETWEEN THE EYES OF THE SOMNAMBULISTS TEETERING UP AND DOWN MUTTERING MAGIC PHRASES AND THANKING GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT AS OTHER ANIMALS
HE RAISES THE CRY OF THE MISERABLE AND THE DESPISED AND IN A MASTERLY ARRAIGNMENT OF COMMERCIALISM PROTESTS AGAINST SOCIAL CONDITIONS AGAINST THE GRINDING OF THE FACES OF THE POOR AND WEAK AND THE SELF POLLUTION OF THE RICH AND STRONG IN THEIR MAD LUST FOR PLACE AND POWER
HER SOLE SUPPORT MAY GO TO THE FRONT ARE BOTH EXPRESSING THE UNANIMITY OF THE DREAM THE LATE DISTURBANCE IN THE FAR EAST MARKED THE CLASHING OF THE DREAMS FOR THE SLAV TOO IS DREAMING GREATLY
AND THEY HAVEN'T A PENNY BUT FOMA CAN ONLY BE DESTRUCTIVE HE IS NOT CONSTRUCTIVE THE DIM GROPING SPIRIT OF HIS MOTHER AND THE CURSE OF HIS ENVIRONMENT PRESS TOO HEAVILY UPON HIM AND HE IS CRUSHED TO DEBAUCHERY AND MADNESS
AND THAT HE MAY DO NOTHING WHICH THEY DO NOT DO IT IS ONLY IN SOME WAY SUCH AS THIS THAT WE MAY UNDERSTAND AND EXPLAIN THE DIGNITY WHICH ATTACHES ITSELF TO DOLLARS IN THE WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WE MAY ASSURE OURSELVES THAT THERE IS NO SUCH DIGNITY
HE CANNOT BEGIN LIVING UNTIL HE KNOWS WHAT LIVING MEANS AND HE SEEKS ITS MEANING VAINLY WHY SHOULD I TRY TO LIVE LIFE WHEN I DO NOT KNOW WHAT LIFE IS HE OBJECTS WHEN MAYAKIN STRIVES WITH HIM TO RETURN AND MANAGE HIS BUSINESS
A QUIET SUBMISSION TO THE INEVITABLE A STOIC COMPOSURE IN SIGHT OF DANGER OR CALAMITY A DISDAIN OF LIFE AND FRIENDLINESS WITH DEATH HE RELATES HIMSELF TO THE STATE AS AMONGST BEES THE WORKER IS RELATED TO THE HIVE HIMSELF NOTHING
A BARBER SHAMPOOED MY HAIR A SERVANT RETURNED WITH CORN BEEF IN TINS A BOTTLE OF PORT ANOTHER OF COGNAC AND BEER
WHAT ITS FEVER IS IN FOMA GORDYEEFF IT IS A RUSSIAN WHO SO RISES UP AND DEMANDS FOR GORKY THE BITTER ONE IS ESSENTIALLY A RUSSIAN IN HIS GRASP ON THE FACTS OF LIFE AND IN HIS TREATMENT
A SYMPATHY AND COMRADESHIP AND WARM HUMAN FEEL WHICH IS OURS INDUBITABLY OURS AND WHICH WE CANNOT TEACH TO THE ORIENTAL AS WE WOULD TEACH LOGARITHMS OR THE TRAJECTORY OF PROJECTILES
MANAGED AND GUIDED BY FORTY FIVE MILLION ADDITIONAL HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE SPLENDID FIGHTING ANIMALS SCIENTIFIC AND MODERN CONSTITUTE THAT MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD WHICH HAS BEEN WELL NAMED THE YELLOW PERIL
HIS FORMS CUSTOMS AND METHODS HAVE BEEN PERMANENT THESE MANY CENTURIES BUT THIS HAS BEEN DUE TO THE FACT THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE LEARNED CLASSES AND THAT THESE GOVERNING SCHOLARS FOUND THEIR SALVATION LAY IN SUPPRESSING ALL PROGRESSIVE IDEAS
BUT WHEN I HAD RECOVERED MY REASON I FELL UPON MY PARTICULAR GODS AND BERATED THEM MIGHTILY AND AS PENANCE FOR THEIR WATCHLESSNESS PLACED THEM AWAY AMONGST DUST AND COBWEBS OH NO NOT FOR LONG
IT REQUIRED NO REVOLUTION OF HIS NATURE TO LEARN TO CALCULATE THE RANGE AND FIRE A FIELD GUN OR TO MARCH THE GOOSE STEP IT WAS A MERE MATTER OF TRAINING OUR MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENT IS THE PRODUCT OF OUR INTELLECT
AND THE ASSERTION WILL MAKE THEM ANGRY FOR A MOMENT THEY POSSESS SEVERAL MAGIC PHRASES WHICH ARE LIKE THE INCANTATIONS OF A VOODOO DOCTOR DRIVING DEVILS AWAY THE PHRASES THAT THE GOOD KIND PEOPLE REPEAT TO THEMSELVES
YET MAN TO DAY IS THE SAME MAN THAT DRANK FROM HIS ENEMY'S SKULL IN THE DARK GERMAN FORESTS THAT SACKED CITIES AND STOLE HIS WOMEN FROM NEIGHBOURING CLANS LIKE ANY HOWLING ABORIGINE
CLEANING THE CONFUSION PREPARATORY TO REBUILDING THEY WERE CLAD IN BLUE PIGTAILS HUNG DOWN THEIR BACKS I WAS IN CHINA I RODE TO THE SHORE INTO THE VILLAGE OF KUELIAN CHING
SO I AVOIDED THEIR LOOKS SHRINKING CLOSE TO THE KERBSTONE AND BY FURTIVE GLANCES DIRECTING MY PROGRESS AT LAST I CAME HARD BY THE PLACE AND PEERING STEALTHILY TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT THAT NONE WHO KNEW MIGHT BEHOLD ME I ENTERED HURRIEDLY
HE IS SEEN CALMLY BENDING TO HIS USUAL TASKS NAY WAR ITSELF BEARS FRUITS WHEREOF HE MAY PICK BEFORE THE DEAD ARE COLD OR THE BURIAL SQUADS HAVE ARRIVED HE IS OUT ON THE FIELD
WHY IS THAT AND WHAT JUSTIFICATION HAVE I AND HOW WILL ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GIVE THEIR ORDERS JUSTIFY THEMSELVES WHAT HAVE THEY LIVED FOR BUT MY IDEA IS THAT EVERYBODY OUGHT WITHOUT FAIL TO KNOW SOLIDLY WHAT HE IS LIVING FOR
AND THE SOLDIER RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FLIGHT
HE WOULD SEE THE WESTERN GIANTS IN POSSESSION OF THE VERY STUFF OF HIS DREAM THE MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD LIES NOT IN THE LITTLE BROWN MAN BUT IN THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF YELLOW MEN SHOULD THE LITTLE BROWN MAN UNDERTAKE THEIR MANAGEMENT
ON ONE SIDE SQUATS A CHINESE CIVILIAN ON HIS HAMS ON THE OTHER SIDE SQUATS A JAPANESE SOLDIER
IT BECOMES THEIR FUNCTION IN SOCIETY AND SOME OF THEM ARE PAID LARGE SALARIES FOR HELPING THEIR FELLOW MEN TO BELIEVE FOR INSTANCE THAT THEY ARE NOT AS OTHER ANIMALS FOR HELPING THE KING TO BELIEVE AND HIS PARASITES AND DRUDGES AS WELL
WHY SHOULD MEN FETCH AND CARRY FOR HIM BE SLAVES TO HIM AND HIS MONEY WORK IS NOT EVERYTHING TO A MAN HE SAYS IT IS NOT TRUE THAT JUSTIFICATION LIES IN WORK SOME PEOPLE NEVER DO ANY WORK AT ALL ALL THEIR LIVES LONG YET THEY LIVE BETTER THAN THE TOILERS
WORK IS WHAT HE DESIRES ABOVE ALL THINGS AND HE WILL WORK AT ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY DURING THE TAKING OF THE TAKU FORTS HE CARRIED SCALING LADDERS AT THE HEADS OF THE STORMING COLUMNS AND PLANTED THEM AGAINST THE WALLS
BUT JOSTLING WITH OUR FELLOWS IN THE WHITE LIGHT OF DAY WE FIND THAT IT DOES EXIST AND THAT WE OURSELVES MEASURE OURSELVES BY THE DOLLARS WE HAPPEN TO POSSESS THEY GIVE US CONFIDENCE AND CARRIAGE AND DIGNITY AY A PERSONAL DIGNITY
ON THE OTHER HAND HIS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEW IDEAS HAS BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED WHEREVER HE HAS ESCAPED BEYOND THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED UPON HIM BY HIS GOVERNMENT SO FAR AS THE BUSINESS MAN IS CONCERNED HE HAS GRASPED FAR MORE CLEARLY THE WESTERN CODE OF BUSINESS
COULD JUDGE ME BY MY CLOTHES ALONE BUT I REFUSED TO BE SO JUDGED MY SPIRITUAL BACKBONE STIFFENED AND I HELD MY HEAD HIGH LOOKING ALL MEN IN THE EYES AND I DID THESE THINGS NOT THAT I WAS AN EGOTIST
HIS NERVE CENTRES OF JUDGMENT AND WILL HAVE NOT BEEN EMPLOYED IN SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF LIFE BUT IN MAINTAINING HIS OWN SOLVENCY BY THE INSOLVENCY OF OTHERS HE TRADES UPON SORROW AND DRAWS A LIVELIHOOD FROM MISFORTUNE
THE COMMODITIES THEY PUT UPON THE MARKET AND WHICH ANNUALLY KILL TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BABIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN
BACK OF OUR OWN GREAT RACE ADVENTURE BACK OF OUR ROBBERIES BY SEA AND LAND OUR LUSTS AND VIOLENCES AND ALL THE EVIL THINGS WE HAVE DONE THERE IS A CERTAIN INTEGRITY A STERNNESS OF CONSCIENCE A MELANCHOLY RESPONSIBILITY OF LIFE
WE HAVE HAD AFRICA FOR THE AFRIKANDER AND AT NO DISTANT DAY WE SHALL HEAR ASIA FOR THE ASIATIC FOUR HUNDRED MILLION INDEFATIGABLE WORKERS DEFT INTELLIGENT AND UNAFRAID TO DIE AROUSED AND REJUVENESCENT
RECEIVING BY HEREDITY THE FIERCE BULL LIKE NATURE OF HIS FATHER PLUS THE PASSIVE INDOMITABLENESS AND GROPING SPIRIT OF HIS MOTHER FOMA PROUD AND REBELLIOUS IS REPELLED BY THE SELFISH MONEY SEEKING ENVIRONMENT INTO WHICH HE IS BORN
THE HOUSES AND WALLS WERE STRONG AND SUBSTANTIAL STONE AND BRICK REPLACED THE MUD WALLS OF THE KOREAN DWELLINGS TWILIGHT FELL AND DEEPENED AND STILL THE PLOUGHS WENT UP AND DOWN THE FIELDS THE SOWERS FOLLOWING AFTER
BUT THEY THINK THEY DO AND THAT IS ALL THAT IS NECESSARY FOR SOMNAMBULISTS THE CALM REPETITION OF SUCH PHRASES INVARIABLY DRIVES AWAY THE WAKING DEVILS AND LULLS TO SLUMBER OUR STATESMEN SELL THEMSELVES AND THEIR COUNTRY FOR GOLD
WHY DO YOU LIVE HE DEMANDS OF THE CONCLAVE OF MERCHANTS OF LIFE'S SUCCESSES YOU HAVE NOT CONSTRUCTED LIFE YOU HAVE MADE A CESSPOOL YOU HAVE DISSEMINATED FILTH AND STIFLING EXHALATIONS BY YOUR DEEDS HAVE YOU ANY CONSCIENCE DO YOU REMEMBER GOD
HE DID THIS NOT FROM A SENSE OF PATRIOTISM BUT FOR THE INVADING FOREIGN DEVILS BECAUSE THEY PAID HIM A DAILY WAGE OF FIFTY CENTS HE IS NOT FRIGHTENED BY WAR HE ACCEPTS IT AS HE DOES RAIN AND SUNSHINE THE CHANGING OF THE SEASONS AND OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA
THE DIGNITY OF DOLLARS MAN IS A BLIND HELPLESS CREATURE HE LOOKS BACK WITH PRIDE UPON HIS GOODLY HERITAGE OF THE AGES AND YET OBEYS UNWITTINGLY EVERY MANDATE OF THAT HERITAGE FOR IT IS INCARNATE WITH HIM AND IN IT ARE EMBEDDED THE DEEPEST ROOTS OF HIS SOUL
EATS REAL FOOD AND SLEEPS UNDER REAL BLANKETS IN ORDER TO KEEP REAL COLD AWAY AND THERE'S THE RUB HE HAS TO EFFECT ADJUSTMENTS WITH THE REAL WORLD AND AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAIN THE SUBLIMITY OF HIS DREAM
FOMA GORDYEEFF IS A BIG BOOK NOT ONLY IS THE BREADTH OF RUSSIA IN IT BUT THE EXPANSE OF LIFE YET THOUGH IN EACH LAND IN THIS WORLD OF MARTS AND EXCHANGES THIS AGE OF TRADE AND TRAFFIC PASSIONATE FIGURES RISE UP AND DEMAND OF LIFE
BUT FOMA WILL HAVE NONE OF IT HE IS NEITHER TO BE ENTICED NOR CAJOLED THE CRY OF HIS NATURE IS FOR LIGHT HE MUST HAVE LIGHT AND IN BURNING REVOLT HE GOES SEEKING THE MEANING OF LIFE HIS THOUGHTS EMBRACED ALL THOSE PETTY PEOPLE WHO TOILED AT HARD LABOUR IT WAS STRANGE
DANCING THE DANCE OF DEATH GROPING FOR THE NAMELESS INDEFINITE SOMETHING THE MAGIC FORMULA THE ESSENCE THE INTRINSIC FACT THE FLASH OF LIGHT THROUGH THE MURK AND DARK THE RATIONAL SANCTION FOR EXISTENCE IN SHORT FOMA GORDYEEFF GOES DOWN TO MADNESS AND DEATH
WHILE MY HEELS THRUST THE CABBAGE MAN BEYOND THE HORIZON MY TOES WERE DRAWING ME FALTERING LIKE A TIMID OLD BEGGAR INTO A ROARING SPATE OF HUMANITY MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WITHOUT END THEY HAD NO CONCERN WITH ME NOR I WITH THEM
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A POWER FOR GOOD IN HIS LIFE SHE MIGHT HAVE SHED LIGHT INTO IT AND LIFTED HIM UP TO SAFETY AND HONOUR AND UNDERSTANDING YET SHE WENT AWAY NEXT DAY AND HE NEVER SAW HER AGAIN NO STORY IS TOLD NOTHING IS FINISHED
OUR SOUL STUFF IS NOT A COIN TO BE POCKETED BY THE FIRST CHANCE COMER THE JAPANESE CANNOT POCKET IT ANY MORE THAN HE CAN THRILL TO SHORT SAXON WORDS OR WE CAN THRILL TO CHINESE HIEROGLYPHICS THE LEOPARD CANNOT CHANGE ITS SPOTS NOR CAN THE JAPANESE
I BOUGHT KNIVES FORKS AND SPOONS GRANITE WARE DISHES AND MUGS THERE WERE HORSESHOES AND HORSESHOERS A WORKER IN IRON REALIZED FOR ME NEW DESIGNS OF MINE FOR MY TENT POLES MY SHOES WERE SENT OUT TO BE REPAIRED
NOR CAN WE WE ARE THUMBED BY THE AGES INTO WHAT WE ARE AND BY NO CONSCIOUS INWARD EFFORT CAN WE IN A DAY RETHUMB OURSELVES NOR CAN THE JAPANESE IN A DAY OR A GENERATION RETHUMB HIMSELF IN OUR IMAGE
YOUNG ONIONS AND THE MAN WHO WAS WEEDING THEM PAUSED FROM HIS LABOUR LONG ENOUGH TO SELL ME A HANDFUL NEAR BY WAS THE SMOKE BLACKENED RUIN OF THE FARMHOUSE FIRED BY THE RUSSIANS WHEN THEY RETREATED FROM THE RIVERBED TWO MEN WERE REMOVING THE DEBRIS
AND A DIGNITY ENTERED INTO ME AND MY NECK WAS STIFFENED MY HEAD POISED I GATHERED TOGETHER CERTAIN CERTIFICATES OF GOODS AND CHATTELS POINTED MY HEEL TOWARDS HIM AND HIS CABBAGES AND JOURNEYED TOWNWARD I WAS YET A MAN
THE WESTERN WORLD IS IN RHAPSODIES OVER IT UNWITTINGLY MEASURING THE JAPANESE PATRIOTISM BY ITS OWN CONCEPTIONS OF PATRIOTISM FOR GOD MY COUNTRY AND THE CZAR CRIES THE RUSSIAN PATRIOT
THE RESULT OF THIS ADMIXTURE OF THE REAL AND THE UNREAL IS CONFUSION THRICE CONFOUNDED THE MAN THAT WALKS THE REAL WORLD IN HIS SLEEP BECOMES SUCH A TANGLED MASS OF CONTRADICTIONS PARADOXES AND LIES
AND INTO ENDOWED CHURCHES UNIVERSITIES AND LIBRARIES TO SAY NOTHING OF SUBSIDIZED NEWSPAPERS TO PROCLAIM HIS GREATNESS THE RED ANIMAL IN THE SOMNAMBULIST WILL OUT HE DECRIES THE CARNAL COMBAT OF THE PRIZE RING
THEY ARE AGAIN ENSHRINED AS BRIGHT AND POLISHED AS OF YORE AND MY DESTINY IS ONCE MORE IN THEIR KEEPING IT IS GIVEN THAT TRAVAIL AND VICISSITUDE MARK TIME TO MAN'S FOOTSTEPS AS HE STUMBLES ONWARD TOWARD THE GRAVE AND IT IS WELL WITHOUT THE BITTER ONE MAY NOT KNOW THE SWEET
WILL DIE ALL IN GOOD TIME IN THE COURSE OF NATURAL EVOLUTION BUT THEY WILL NOT DIE SO LONG AS THE COWARDLY SOMNAMBULISTIC APES AND TIGERS CLUB AND SCRATCH AND SLASH THIS IS NOT A BRIEF FOR THE PRIZE FIGHTER
WHEREFORE IT WAS IN FEAR AND TREMBLING AND WITH GREAT MODESTY OF SPIRIT THAT I ENTERED THE PRESENCE TO CONFESS THAT I WAS SHOCKED
BUT IF A MAN IS WEAK NOT INCLINED TO WORK SPIT UPON HIM AND GO YOUR WAY AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT WHEN A MAN COMPLAINS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND CRIES OUT AND GROANS HE IS NOT WORTH MORE THAN TWO KOPEKS HE IS NOT WORTHY OF PITY AND WILL BE OF NO USE TO YOU IF YOU DO HELP HIM
AT MY ANCIENT DIGNITY WHICH HAD RETURNED THERE WAS A TINKLING CHINK AS I RAN THE YELLOW PIECES THROUGH MY FINGERS AND WITH THE GOLDEN MUSIC RIPPLING ROUND ME I CAUGHT A DEEPER INSIGHT INTO THE MYSTERY OF THINGS
WE ARE PRE EMINENTLY A RELIGIOUS RACE WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT WE ARE A RIGHT SEEKING RACE
GET BETWEEN HIM AND THE FEMALE OF HIS KIND UPON WHOM HIS MATING INSTINCT IS BENT AND SEE HIS EYES BLAZE LIKE AN ANGRY CAT'S HEAR IN HIS THROAT THE SCREAM OF WILD STALLIONS AND WATCH HIS FISTS CLENCH LIKE AN ORANG OUTANG'S
I PUT MY SIGNATURE TO CERTAIN INDENTURES RECEIVED MY POTTAGE AND FLED FROM HIS PRESENCE
BUT IN THE JAPANESE MIND THERE IS NO DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE THREE THE EMPEROR IS THE EMPEROR AND GOD AND COUNTRY AS WELL THE PATRIOTISM OF THE JAPANESE IS BLIND AND UNSWERVING LOYALTY TO WHAT IS PRACTICALLY AN ABSOLUTISM
BUT NO STORY IS TOLD NOTHING IS FINISHED SOME ONE WILL OBJECT SURELY WHEN SASHA LEAPED OVERBOARD AND SWAM TO FOMA SOMETHING HAPPENED IT WAS PREGNANT WITH POSSIBILITIES YET IT WAS NOT FINISHED
THEY HAD TRAMPED PROBABLY FORTY MILES THAT DAY DOWN FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES JUST FOR A LOOK SEE AND FORTY MILES BACK THEY WOULD CHEERFULLY TRAMP CHATTERING ALL THE WAY OVER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN
YOU WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S HANDS FOR ALL THIS YOU SHALL BE MADE TO PAY YOU SHALL PERISH YOU SHALL BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL FOR ALL TO THE LAST LITTLE TEAR DROP
WHOLE ANCESTRY BEARING HEAVILY UPON HIM AND AGAIN IN THE MATTER OF HIS IDEAS WHICH HAVE BEEN THRUST UPON HIM AND WHICH HE HAS BEEN BUSILY GARNERING FROM THE GREAT WORLD EVER SINCE THE DAY WHEN HIS EYES FIRST FOCUSSED AND HE DREW STARTLED
EVERYBODY WORKED EVERYTHING WORKED I SAW A MAN MENDING THE ROAD I WAS IN CHINA I CAME TO THE CITY OF ANTUNG AND LODGED WITH A MERCHANT HE WAS A GRAIN MERCHANT
STUNNED BY THIS PUDDLE OF LIFE UNABLE TO MAKE SENSE OF IT FOMA QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONS VAINLY WHETHER OF SOFYA MEDYNSKY IN HER DRAWING ROOM OF BEAUTY OR IN THE
BUT IMITATING US ONLY IN THINGS MATERIAL THINGS SPIRITUAL CANNOT BE IMITATED THEY MUST BE FELT AND LIVED WOVEN INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF LIFE AND HERE THE JAPANESE FAILS
HE FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE CHANGING CONDITIONS THEMSELVES ABSOLVE HIM AND IN SO FAR ADAPTABLE AS HE HAS SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE IN OTHER RESPECTS
STRIPPING THE MANGLED BODIES COLLECTING THE SHRAPNEL AND FERRETING IN THE SHELL HOLES FOR SLIVERS AND FRAGMENTS OF IRON THE CHINESE IS NO COWARD
OR A STATE LEGISLATURE FOR A COMMERCIAL PRIVILEGE BUT HE HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN IN ALL HIS SLEEP WALKING HISTORY TO BRIBE ANY LEGISLATIVE BODY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ANY MORAL END SUCH AS FOR INSTANCE ABOLITION OF PRIZE FIGHTING CHILD LABOUR LAWS
HE HIMSELF WOULD VERY SOON BECOME ONE OF HIS SERVANTS AS IF HE WERE A THING THAT BELONGED TO HIS WEALTH AND SO WAS BOUND TO FOLLOW ITS FORTUNE
AND THEN ONE FINE DAY CROSS OVER THE YALU INTO MANCHURIA IT WOULD BE OF EXCEPTIONAL ADVANTAGE TO THE CORRECTNESS OF APPRECIATION DID HE CROSS OVER THE YALU ON THE HEELS OF A HOSTILE AND ALIEN ARMY
OR ANARCHISTS THEY PAINT PICTURES FOR THE COMMERCIAL MEN WRITE BOOKS FOR THEM SING SONGS FOR THEM ACT PLAYS FOR THEM AND DOSE THEM WITH VARIOUS DRUGS WHEN THEIR BODIES HAVE GROWN GROSS OR DYSPEPTIC FROM OVEREATING AND LACK OF EXERCISE
NOR HAS HIS MIND CHANGED THERE IS NO FACULTY OF THE MIND OF MAN TO DAY THAT DID NOT EXIST IN THE MINDS OF THE MEN OF LONG AGO MAN HAS TO DAY NO CONCEPT THAT IS TOO WIDE AND DEEP AND ABSTRACT FOR THE MIND OF PLATO OR ARISTOTLE TO GRASP
AND AS TRULY WAS THE JAPANESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE UP TO A GENERATION AGO
BUT HE STILL TOILED SIDE BY SIDE WITH YOUNG MEN AND THEY ALL PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO FOMA'S IMAGINATION AS A HUGE HEAP OF WORMS WHO WERE SWARMING OVER THE EARTH MERELY TO EAT HE BECOMES THE LIVING INTERROGATION OF LIFE
DIFFERENTIATIONS BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIVERSE CONDITIONS AND INFUSIONS OF OTHER BLOOD BUT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR BEING TWISTED INTO THE FIBRES OF THEM IS A HERITAGE IN COMMON A SAMENESS IN KIND WHICH TIME HAS NOT OBLITERATED
CORN HE HAD HUNDREDS OF BUSHELS STORED IN GREAT BINS OF STOUT MATTING PEAS AND BEANS IN SACKS AND IN THE BACK YARD HIS MILLSTONES WENT ROUND AND ROUND GRINDING OUT MEAL ALSO IN HIS BACK YARD WERE BUILDINGS CONTAINING VATS SUNK INTO THE GROUND
LONG AGO ONE BORROWED THE OTHER'S WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND LONG BEFORE THAT UNTOLD GENERATIONS AGO THEY DIVERGED FROM A COMMON ROOT THE ANCIENT MONGOL STOCK THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES
ONLY EXISTS THE HONOUR OF THE STATE WHICH IS HIS HONOUR HE DOES NOT LOOK UPON HIMSELF AS A FREE AGENT WORKING OUT HIS OWN PERSONAL SALVATION SPIRITUAL AGONIZING IS UNKNOWN TO HIM HE HAS A SENSE OF CALM TRUST IN FATE
THE CHINESE IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INDUSTRY FOR SHEER WORK NO WORKER IN THE WORLD CAN COMPARE WITH HIM WORK IS THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS IT IS HIS SOLUTION OF EXISTENCE
HE LACKS THE NERVE TO REMAIN WHEN A STRANGE ARMY CROSSES HIS LAND THE FEW GOODS AND CHATTELS HE MAY HAVE MANAGED TO ACCUMULATE HE PUTS ON HIS BACK ALONG WITH HIS DOORS AND WINDOWS AND AWAY HE HEADS FOR HIS MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES
EQUIPPED WITH THE FINEST MACHINES AND SYSTEMS OF DESTRUCTION THE CAUCASIAN MIND HAS DEVISED HANDLING MACHINES AND SYSTEMS WITH REMARKABLE AND DEADLY ACCURACY THIS REJUVENESCENT JAPANESE RACE HAS EMBARKED ON A COURSE OF CONQUEST THE GOAL OF WHICH NO MAN KNOWS
A MAN WITH A WOMAN BEHIND HIM BOTH OLD AND SPECTACLED ALL THREE MOTIONLESS ON THE BANK AND LOOKING AT HIM
AND A WILD ELATION SETTLED IN HER HEART THAT JOHN HALE WAS ALIVE AND UNHURT THOUGH RUFE WAS DEAD HER FATHER WOUNDED AND BUB AND DAVE BOTH HAD BUT NARROWLY ESCAPED THE FALIN ASSASSINS THAT AFTERNOON
AND ONE OF THE BOYS RAN HIS EYES UP BOOT AND LEG AND IF THEY WERE LIFTED HIGHER HALE COULD NOT TELL WHAR'D YOU GIT HIM HE SQUEAKED THE GIRL TURNED HER HEAD AS THE MULE BROKE INTO A TROT AIN'T GOT TIME TO TELL THEY ARE MY COUSINS EXPLAINED THE GIRL
WHY I'M TAKING CARE OF THIS LITTLE GIRL OH WELL YOU SEE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE TWO DAYS BUT HIS FRANK GENEROUS FACE BROKE INTO A WINNING SMILE
BEYOND WAS A CABIN IN THE DOORWAY WERE SEVERAL FACES AND SITTING ON A HORSE AT THE GATE WAS YOUNG DAVE TOLLIVER WELL I GIT DOWN HERE SAID THE GIRL AND BEFORE HIS MULE STOPPED SHE SLID FROM BEHIND HIM AND MADE FOR THE GATE WITHOUT A WORD OF THANKS OR GOOD BY
THAT FAR AWAY HE COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS ANGRY AND HE HURRIED TOWARD HER HER FACE WAS WHITE WITH RAGE HER MOUTH WAS TIGHT AND HER DARK EYES WERE AFLAME THEN FROM THE GROUP ANOTHER TALL BOY DARTED OUT
AND THAT SUITED HIS DARK PURPOSES WELL THAT VERY NIGHT WITH HIS BIG RIFLE HE SLIPPED THROUGH THE WOODS TO A TURN OF THE ROAD OVER WHICH OLD DAVE TOLLIVER WAS TO PASS NEXT MORNING
AND MURMURING IN THE WIND LIKE THE UNDERTONE OF A FAR OFF SEA AS THEY PASSED THE BASE OF IT SHE REACHED OUT HER HAND AND LET THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS BRUSH CARESSINGLY ACROSS ITS TRUNK TURNED QUICKLY
MAYBE I AM MY NAME'S HALE THE GIRL LAUGHED WELL IF THIS AIN'T THE BEATENEST I'VE HEERD JUNE TALK ABOUT YOU
I APOLOGIZE
AN ATMOSPHERIC DIFFERENCE HE FELT AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE DOOR THE CROWD HAD MELTED FROM THE SQUARE THERE WERE NO WOMEN IN SIGHT BUT EIGHT ARMED MEN WERE IN FRONT OF THE DOOR AND TWO OF THEM A RED FALIN AND A BLACK TOLLIVER BAD RUFE IT WAS WERE QUARRELLING
AND THE KEY WAS IN THE LOCK HE ROSE TO GO TO IT AND LOOK WITHIN AND THEN DROPPED HEAVILY BACK INTO HIS CHAIR HE WAS ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY NOW TO GET TO WORK SEVERAL TIMES HE ROSE RESTLESSLY AND LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW
THE OLD MAN KNEW ALL ABOUT THE TROUBLE IN TOWN THE DAY BEFORE
MAN CANNOT LIVE BY BREAD ALONE IN THESE MOUNTAINS SAID THE RED FOX GRIMLY WHEN HALE LAY DOWN HE COULD HEAR THE OLD MAN QUAVERING OUT A HYMN OR TWO ON THE PORCH OUTSIDE AND WHEN WORN OUT WITH THE DAY HE WENT TO SLEEP THE RED FOX WAS READING HIS BIBLE BY THE LIGHT OF A TALLOW DIP
FRIGHTENED LOOK THAT HALE REMEMBERED THE SAME LOOK SHE HAD SHOWN LONG AGO WHEN RUFE'S NAME WAS MENTIONED IN THE OLD MILLER'S CABIN AND WHEN GOING UP THE RIVER ROAD SHE HAD PUT HER CHILDISH TRUST IN HIM TO SEE THAT HER BAD UNCLE BOTHERED HER NO MORE
WAS IN THE HILLS AGAIN AND THE END WAS NOT YET ALREADY PEOPLE WERE POURING IN MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THE MEN SLOUCH HATTED AND STALKING THROUGH THE MUD IN THE RAIN OR FILING IN ON HORSEBACK RIDING DOUBLE SOMETIMES TWO MEN OR TWO WOMEN
HE SAID AS HE WENT UPWARD INTO THE BRIGHT STILLNESS AND WHEN HE DROPPED INTO THE DARK STILLNESS OF SHADOW AND FOREST GLOOM ON THE OTHER SIDE HE SAID AGAIN MY GOD
SWEAR HER JUNE LIFTED HER RIGHT HAND PUT HER LIPS TO THE SOILED OLD BLACK BIBLE AND FACED THE JURY AND HALE AND BAD RUFE TOLLIVER WHOSE BLACK EYES NEVER LEFT HER FACE WHAT IS YOUR NAME
AND LOOSENING HERSELF FROM LORETTA SHE RAN ROUND THE HORSE AND HAD BUB IN HER ARMS THEN SHE LOOKED UP INTO THE EYES OF HER STEP MOTHER THE OLD WOMAN'S FACE LOOKED KIND SO KIND
FOR IT HUNG BELOW HER WAIST AND WAS MUCH LONGER THAN ANY OF THE OTHER GIRLS AT SCHOOL THE TRANSITION WAS EASY NOW SO INTERESTED HAD SHE BECOME SHE GOT OUT HER TAN SHOES AND STOCKINGS AND THE PRETTY WHITE DRESS AND PUT THEM ON THE MILLPOND
AND THEN HE WOULD BE SOBER AND WOULD GO QUIETLY BACK HOME SHE WAS SO COMFORTED THAT SHE GOT TO THINKING ABOUT THE HAIR OF THE GIRL WHO SAT IN FRONT OF HER AT SCHOOL IT WAS PLAITED AND SHE HAD STUDIED JUST HOW IT WAS DONE
A PILE OF FRESH SMELLING PAPERS LAY ON A TABLE AND AFTER A QUESTION OR TWO HE PICKED UP ONE
AND DOWN HALE WENT UNDER A TREMBLING DEW DRENCHED WORLD AND ALONG A TUMBLING SERIES OF WATER FALLS THAT FLASHED THROUGH TALL FERNS BLOSSOMING LAUREL AND SHINING LEAVES OF RHODODENDRON ONCE
I'VE GOT SOME CANDY HERE FOR A NICE LITTLE GIRL HE SAID AS THOUGH THE SUBJECT HAD NOT BEEN MENTIONED BEFORE IT'S FOR YOU WON'T YOU HAVE SOME I RECKON I WILL SHE SAID WITH A HAPPY SMILE
AND SHE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER SHE COULD FIX HER OWN THAT WAY SO SHE GOT IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR AND LOOSENED HERS IN A MASS ABOUT HER SHOULDERS THE MASS THAT WAS TO HALE LIKE THE GOLDEN BRONZE OF A WILD TURKEY'S WING THE OTHER GIRL'S PLAITS WERE THE SAME SIZE
AND THEN THE TEARS CAME IN EARNEST AND SHE TURNED HER HEAD SOBBING HALE HELPLESSLY REACHED OVER AND PATTED HER ON THE SHOULDER BUT SHE SHRANK AWAY FROM HIM GO AWAY SHE SAID
SHE SHOWED NO CURIOSITY NO SURPRISE AND STILL SHE DID NOT LOOK UP AT HIM I MET YOUR COUSIN LORETTA OVER THERE AND I CARRIED HER HOME BEHIND ME ON AN OLD MULE HALE PAUSED SMILING AT THE REMEMBRANCE AND STILL SHE BETRAYED NO INTEREST
ON THE MANTEL WERE TWO PISTOLS AND IN ONE CORNER WAS THE BIG WINCHESTER HE REMEMBERED AND BEHIND IT WAS THE BIG BRASS TELESCOPE ON THE TABLE WAS A BIBLE AND A VOLUME OF SWEDENBORG AND AMONG THE USUAL STRINGS OF PEPPER PODS AND BEANS AND TWISTED LONG GREEN TOBACCO
I'M SORRY LITTLE GIRL THE GIRL LIFTED HER GREAT TROUBLED EYES TO HIM BUT NO WORD PASSED HER LIPS AND HALE HELPLESSLY LEFT HER JUNE DID NOT CRY THAT NIGHT SHE SAT BY THE WINDOW WRETCHED AND TEARLESS
THEN HE LOOKED UP FOR AN INSTANT HE SEEMED TERRIFIED BUT HE DID NOT RUN INSTEAD HE STEALTHILY SHIFTED THE PINE DAGGER OVER TO HIS RIGHT HAND AND THE STRING TO HIS LEFT HERE BOY SAID THE FISHERMAN WITH AFFECTED STERNNESS
THE BARN DOOR SAGGED ON ITS HINGES THE YARD FENCE SWAYED DRUNKENLY AND THE CABIN WAS STILL AS A GRAVESTONE BUT THE GARDEN WAS ALIVE AND HE SWUNG FROM HIS HORSE AT THE GATE
BOB WHO HAD BEEN A YEAR IN A MILITARY SCHOOL WAS DRILL MASTER FOR THE RECRUITS AND VERY GRAVELY HE PERFORMED HIS DUTIES AND PUT THEM THROUGH THE SKIRMISHERS DRILL ADVANCING IN RUSHES THROWING THEMSELVES IN THE NEW GRASS
SHE WENT OUT TO THE STABLE AND LED OUT THE OLD SORREL MARE SHE WAS GOING TO THE HANGING
YOU DIDN'T GIVE THAT LITTLE GAL A FAIR CHANCE JOHN AN I WANT YOU TO GO TO JUNE NO I CAN'T TAKE YOUR MONEY UNCLE BILLY GOD BLESS YOU AND OLD HON
THE GIRL SHRANK TO THE BUSHES BUT SHE CRIED SHARPLY BACK DON'T YOU HURT HIM NOW DAD HE AIN'T EVEN GOT A PISTOL HE AIN'T NO SHET UP
PINIONED THE FELLOW'S ARMS FROM BEHIND AND BOB TOOK HIS WEAPON AWAY HELL SAID THE MOUNTAINEER I DIDN'T AIM TO HURT THE LITTLE FELLER I JES WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD SKEER HIM WELL BROTHER TIS SCARCE A MERRY JEST
AND SEEMED TO LOVE HER MOOD WHETHER SHE CRIED FROM JOY OR ANGER AND YET SHE KEPT ON DOING BOTH JUST THE SAME SEVERAL TIMES DEVIL JUDD STOPPED TO LET HIS HORSE REST AND EACH TIME OF COURSE THE WOODED SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS
AND LITTLE TREMBLINGS WENT THROUGH HER FROM HER BARE FEET TO HER BONNETED HEAD THUS WAS SHE UNCLAD FOR HALE HAD TOLD HER THAT TO AVOID CRITICISM SHE MUST GO HOME CLOTHED JUST AS SHE WAS WHEN SHE LEFT LONESOME COVE
BUT HALE COULD TELL HIM NOTHING THAT HE SEEMED NOT ALREADY TO KNOW IT WAS QUAR THE OLD MOUNTAINEER SAID
AND NOT A HORSE WAS AVAILABLE SO HE STARTED THOSE TWENTY MILES AFOOT AND DAY WAS BREAKING WHEN HE LOOKED DOWN ON THE LITTLE VALLEY SHROUDED IN MIST AND JUST WAKENING FROM SLEEP THINGS HAD BEEN MOVING WHILE HE WAS AWAY AS HE QUICKLY LEARNED
HALE OPENED HIS EYES NEXT MORNING ON THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN IN BLACK MOVING GHOST LIKE THROUGH THE DIM INTERIOR TO THE KITCHEN A WOOD THRUSH WAS SINGING WHEN HE STEPPED OUT ON THE PORCH AND ITS COOL NOTES HAD THE LIQUID FRESHNESS OF THE MORNING
AND THE GRIZZLED JUDGE WAS SPEAKING ANGRILY THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE HAD THIS TRIAL POSTPONED BECAUSE YOU HAIN'T GOT NO LAWYER I AIN'T GOIN TO PUT IT OFF HAVE YOU GOT YOU A LAWYER NOW YES JEDGE SAID THE DEFENDANT
THE MOUNTAINEER FINDS A HARD THING TO UNDERSTAND IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THE MOTIVE OF THE GUARD WAS VINDICTIVE AND PERSONAL AND OLD JUDD WAS ALMOST STIFLED BY THE VOLCANIC RAGE THAT DAILY GREW WITHIN HIM AS THE TOILS DAILY TIGHTENED ABOUT RUFE TOLLIVER
ALL RIGHT JUNY THEY SHOT ME FROM THE LAUREL
I RECKON THEY'VE GOT ME THIS TIME NO NO HE SAW HER EYES FIXED ON THE MATTED BLOOD ON HIS CHEST HIT'S STOPPED
SHE SAID STILL NOT LOOKING AT HIM AND WITH A LITTLE MOVEMENT OF HER KNEES AWAY FROM HIM
HALE THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THE ORDINANCE AGAINST BLOWING A WHISTLE HAD NOT YET BEEN PASSED BUT HE MADE UP HIS MIND THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES JACK'S BLOWING WAS A BREACH OF THE PEACE SINCE THE GUARD HAD ADOPTED THAT SIGNAL SO HE SAID
AND HELD THE WEAPON AWAY SO THAT IT WAS HARMLESS AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED BUT A CROWD WAS GATHERING AT THE DOOR TOWARD WHICH THE SALOON KEEPER'S PISTOL WAS POINTED AND HE FEARED THAT SOMEBODY OUT THERE MIGHT BE SHOT SO HE CALLED OUT DROP THAT PISTOL
WHERE HALE HAD PUT HIS BIG BLACK HORSE INTO A DEAD RUN AND AS VIVID A THRILL OF IT CAME BACK TO HER NOW AS HAD BEEN THE THRILL OF THE RACE THEN THEY BEGAN TO CLIMB LABORIOUSLY UP THE ROCKY CREEK THE WATER SINGING A JOYOUS WELCOME TO HER ALONG THE PATH
SO LONG HE SAID SEE YOU AGIN SOME DAY THE WAY WAS STEEP AND THE SUN WAS DOWN AND DARKNESS GATHERING BEFORE HALE REACHED THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN SO HE HALLOOED AT THE YARD FENCE OF THE RED FOX WHO PEERED CAUTIOUSLY OUT OF THE DOOR
I HATE HER SHE SAID FIERCELY WHY LITTLE GIRL HE SAID GENTLY
SHE'D BETTER GO HOME NOW BUT THE PATH HAD A SNAKE LIKE CHARM FOR HER AND STILL SHE STOOD FOLLOWING IT AS FAR DOWN AS SHE COULD WITH HER EYES DOWN IT WENT
IT WAS A BIG WORLD THOUGH THAT WAS SPREAD BEFORE HER AND A VAGUE AWE OF IT SEIZED HER STRAIGHTWAY AND HELD HER MOTIONLESS AND DREAMING BEYOND THOSE WHITE MISTS TRAILING UP THE HILLS
TO A FENCE ONE SIDE OF IT TWO HORSES WERE HITCHED AND ON ONE HORSE WAS A SIDE SADDLE BEFORE THE DOOR STOOD THE RED FOX AND UNCLE BILLY THE MILLER WHO PEERED AT HER FOR A MOMENT THROUGH HIS BIG SPECTACLES
AGAIN WITH HER EYES ON RUFE SHE REPEATED
SAID THE LITTLE FELLOW PANTING IN SYMPATHY
HE HADN'T THE CAR FARE FOR HALF WAY ACROSS THE CONTINENT AND EVEN IF HE HAD HE WAS A PROMISING CANDIDATE FOR MATRIMONY AND AGAIN HE SHOOK HIS SHOULDERS AND SETTLED HIS SOUL FOR HIS PURPOSE HE WOULD GET HIS THINGS TOGETHER AND LEAVE THOSE HILLS FOREVER
OUT OF THE CHASM AND UP THE LITTLE VALLEY TOWARD THE TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE INTO WHICH THE FATHER'S OLD SORREL NAG WITH A SWITCH OF HER SUNBURNT TAIL TURNED LEFTWARD JUNE LEANED FORWARD A LITTLE
BAD RUFE TOLLIVER WHIPPED OUT HIS REVOLVER AND BEFORE HE COULD LEVEL IT A FALIN STRUCK THE MUZZLE OF A PISTOL INTO HIS BACK ANOTHER TOLLIVER FLASHED HIS WEAPON ON THE FALIN THIS TOLLIVER WAS COVERED BY ANOTHER FALIN AND IN SO MANY FLASHES OF LIGHTNING
EVERY HAPPENING THE OLD MAN LEARNED THROUGH THE RED FOX WHO WITH HIS HUGE PISTOLS WAS ONE OF THE MEN WHO ESCORTED RUFE TO AND FROM COURT HOUSE AND JAIL A VOLUNTEER HALE SUPPOSED BECAUSE HE HATED RUFE
AND YET EVERYBODY HAD DASHED TOWARD HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD STOLEN SOMETHING EVEN HALE YES EVEN THAT BOY WITH THE CAP WHO HAD STOOD UP FOR HER AT SCHOOL THAT AFTERNOON HE HAD RUSHED UP HIS FACE AFLAME WITH EXCITEMENT
GEE GEE THE FROG HOPPED SEVERAL TIMES
WRITHING THIS WAY AND THAT TO A SPUR THAT HAD BEEN SWEPT BARE BY FOREST FIRES ALONG THIS SPUR IT TRAVELLED STRAIGHT FOR A WHILE AND AS HER EYES EAGERLY FOLLOWED IT TO WHERE IT SANK SHARPLY INTO A COVERT OF MAPLES
AN HOUR LATER THEY WERE RIDING SIDE BY SIDE HALE AND JUNE ON THROUGH THE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS TOWARD LONESOME COVE UNCLE BILLY TURNED BACK FROM THE GATE TO THE PORCH
COLOUR CAME WITH THE WILD FLOWERS AND SONG WITH THE WOOD THRUSH SQUIRRELS PLAYED ON THE TREE TRUNKS LIKE MISCHIEVOUS CHILDREN THE BROOKS SANG LIKE HAPPY HUMAN VOICES THROUGH THE TREMULOUS UNDERWORLD AND WOODPECKERS HAMMERED OUT THE JOY OF SPRING
SHE'S A MIGHTY PRETTY GIRL AND WHENEVER I'D HIT THAT OLD SHE HAIN'T THE WORDS WERE SO SHRIEKED OUT THAT HALE WAS BEWILDERED AND THEN HE GUESSED THAT THE FALLING OUT BETWEEN THE FATHERS WAS MORE SERIOUS THAN HE HAD SUPPOSED
THUS SHE ARGUED TO HERSELF BUT HOW DID THAT GIRL MANAGE TO PLAIT IT BEHIND HER BACK SHE DID IT IN FRONT OF COURSE SO JUNE DIVIDED THE BRONZE HEAP BEHIND HER AND PULLED ONE HALF OF IT IN FRONT OF HER AND THEN FOR A MOMENT SHE WAS HELPLESS
AND IT WAS A QUICK AND CUNNING RUSE HE OWED HER SOMETHING FOR THAT WHY DID SHE TRY TO PROTECT HIM WONDERFUL EYES TOO THE LITTLE THING HAD DEEP AND DARK AND HOW THE FLAME DID DART FROM THEM WHEN SHE GOT ANGRY HE SMILED REMEMBERING
IN THE BARN YARD YOU KNOW THAT HOSS YES
THEN SHE LAUGHED IT MUST BE DONE LIKE THE GRASS BLADES AND STRINGS SHE HAD PLAITED FOR BUB OF COURSE SO DIVIDING THAT HALF INTO THREE PARTS SHE DID THE PLAITING SWIFTLY AND EASILY WHEN IT WAS FINISHED SHE LOOKED AT THE BRAID MUCH PLEASED
THE GIANT'S HEAVY EYES LIFTED QUICKLY BUT HE SPOKE TO THE GIRL YOU GO ON HOME
WITH HER HANDS BEHIND HER AND HER EYES BENT ON THE ROAD WHAT SHOULD SHE DO SHE HAD NO MONEY HER FATHER HAD NONE TO SPARE AND SHE COULD ACCEPT NO MORE FROM HALE ONCE SHE STOPPED AND STARED WITH UNSEEING EYES AT THE BLUE SKY
AND THERE WAS THE CREST OF THE BIG TREE MOTIONLESS IN THE BLUE HIGH ABOVE AND SHELTERED BY ONE BIG WHITE CLOUD IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD SEEN THE PINE SINCE SHE HAD FIRST LEFT IT
AND BUILT A BLIND BEHIND SOME ROCKS AND LAY THERE SMOKING PEACEFULLY AND DREAMING HIS SWEDENBORGIAN DREAMS
HAVEN'T YOU GOT SOME KINFOLKS OVER THE MOUNTAIN YES I GOT AN UNCLE LIVIN OVER THAR DEVIL JUDD FOLKS CALLS HIM SAID THE GIRL SIMPLY THIS GIRL WAS COUSIN TO LITTLE JUNE IN LONESOME COVE
SHE PUT HER HANDS TO HER HEAD AS THOUGH SHE WERE CRAZED AND THEN SHE TURNED AND BROKE INTO A SWIFT RUN UP THE ROAD PANTING JUNE REACHED THE GATE THE FRONT DOOR WAS CLOSED AND THERE SHE GAVE A TREMULOUS CRY FOR BUB
NO SAID JUNE FIERCELY WELL YOU NEEDN'T GIT MAD ABOUT IT
HOW THE MEMORIES THRONGED OF JUNE JUNE JUNE YOU DIDN'T GIVE HER A CHANCE THAT WAS WHAT BUDD SAID WELL HAD HE GIVEN HER A CHANCE WHY SHOULDN'T HE GO TO HER AND GIVE HER THE CHANCE NOW
IN HER WONDER OVER HIM SHE ALMOST FORGOT HERSELF FORGOT TO WONDER WHERE HE WAS GOING AND WHY HE WAS COMING INTO THOSE LONELY HILLS UNTIL AS HIS HORSE TURNED A BEND OF THE TRAIL
WHEN YOU GIT THROUGH FISHIN COME UP TO THE HOUSE RIGHT UP THE CREEK THAR AN I'LL GIVE YE A DRAM THANK YOU SAID THE FISHERMAN STIFFLY AND THE MOUNTAINEER TURNED SILENTLY AWAY AT THE EDGE OF THE BUSHES HE LOOKED BACK THE STRANGER WAS STILL FISHING
THAT PATH THAT COILED UNDER THE CLIFF AND RAN DOWN LOOP BY LOOP THROUGH MAJESTIC OAK AND POPLAR AND MASSES OF RHODODENDRON SHE DREW A LONG BREATH AND STIRRED UNEASILY
BUT I'VE BEEN PLUM SICK O THESE DOIN'S A LONG TIME NOW AND SOMETIMES I THINK I'LL JUST PULL UP STAKES AND GO WEST AND GIT OUT OF HIT ALTOGETHER HOW DID YOU LEARN SO MUCH ABOUT YESTERDAY SO SOON
SAID HALE CALMLY BUT IN THE PALE EYES HE STILL SAW SUSPICION WHEN THEY ENTERED THE CABIN A LITTLE OLD WOMAN IN BLACK DUMB AND NOISELESS WAS COOKING SUPPER THE CHILDREN OF THE TWO HE LEARNED HAD SCATTERED AND THEY LIVED THERE ALONE
THE LITTLE GIRL WAS PUSHING HER BONNET BACK WHEN HALE STEPPED INTO SIGHT AND UNSTARTLED UNSMILING UNSPEAKING SHE LOOKED STEADILY AT HIM ONE HAND MOTIONLESS FOR A MOMENT ON HER BRONZE HEAP OF HAIR
HE WAS NEAR BURSTING WITH RAGE YOU BET I WILL SAID THE BOY WITH THE CAP HEARTILY RIGHT NOW AND HE DROPPED HIS BOOKS TO THE GROUND HOLD ON SAID HALE JUMPING BETWEEN THEM
IN THE ROAD ACROSS THE CREEK WAS A CHUBBY TOW HAIRED BOY WITH A LONG SWITCH IN HIS RIGHT HAND AND A PINE DAGGER AND A STRING IN HIS LEFT ATTACHED TO THE STRING AND TIED BY ONE HIND LEG WAS A FROG
AND HALE LEFT THE JUDGE BERATING THEM AND WENT TO THE HOTEL TO GET READY FOR THE GAP LITTLE DREAMING HOW FIXED THE FACES OF SOME OF THOSE MEN WERE IN HIS BRAIN AND HOW LATER THEY WERE TO RISE IN HIS MEMORY AGAIN HIS HORSE WAS LAME BUT HE MUST GO ON
ON ONE CORNER OF THE SQUARE HE COULD SEE THE CHIEF STORE OF THE TOWN MARKED BUCK FALIN GENERAL MERCHANDISE AND THE BIG MAN IN THE DOOR WITH THE BUSHY REDHEAD HE GUESSED WAS THE LEADER OF THE FALIN CLAN OUTSIDE THE DOOR STOOD A SMALLER REPLICA OF THE SAME FIGURE
THAT LITTLE GIRL SHE WAS A PART OF ITS MISTS ITS LIGHTS AND SHADOWS ITS FRESH WILD BEAUTY AND ITS MYSTERY ONLY ONCE DID HIS MIND SHIFT FROM HER TO HIS GREAT PURPOSE
AND WHENEVER HE DID SPEAK SHE KNEW WHAT HE WAS GOING TO SAY IT'S ALL OVER JUNY THEY'VE BEAT US ON EVERY TURN THEY'VE GOT US ONE BY ONE THAR AIN'T BUT A FEW OF US LEFT NOW AND WHEN I GIT UP IF I EVER DO
NOW BOTH MAN AND HORSE HAD STOPPED THE STRANGER HAD TAKEN OFF HIS GRAY SLOUCHED HAT AND HE WAS WIPING HIS FACE WITH SOMETHING WHITE SOMETHING BLUE WAS TIED LOOSELY ABOUT HIS THROAT
YES THAT'S SO HE REPEATED AS HE PLUNGED DOWN THE STAIRS TO DANIEL BURTON HIMSELF SUSAN MADE NO FURTHER PROTESTS OR EVEN COMMENTS EXCEPT THE SILENT COMMENT OF EAGER SERVICE WITH SOME FAVORITE DISH FOR EVERY MEAL
I'VE BEEN INTENDING TO TELL YOU FOR SOME TIME I I SHALL WANT BREAKFAST AT SEVEN O'CLOCK TO MORROW MORNING
THERE AIN'T THAT TRUE EVERY WORD OF IT SHE DEMANDED AN THERE AIN'T HARDLY ANY POEM LICENSE IN IT TOO I THINK THEY'RE A WAYS LOTS BETTER WHEN THERE AIN'T BUT SOMETIMES OF COURSE YOU JEST HAVE TO USE IT
THERE THERE SUSAN INTERPOSED KEITH WITH QUICKLY UPLIFTED HAND WE'LL NOT DISCUSS IT PLEASE YES I KNOW I BEGAN THE SUBJECT MYSELF AND IT WAS MY FAULT
I LOVE THY BUDSOME BEAUTY BUT OH I HATE O'ER ANYTHING THY MUD AN SLUSH OH GENTLE SPRING WHEN RUBBERS ARE A DUTY THAT'S THE SHORTEST THE OTHER IS LONGER EXPLAINED SUSAN
TURNED AWAY AND STUMBLED OUT OF THE KITCHEN SUSAN LOOKING AFTER HER DREW A LONG SIGH WORRY NEVER CLIMBED A HILL WORRY NEVER
I KNOW KEITH BUT WHAT IS IT NOW JOHN MC GUIRE HE'S BEEN TELLING ME HOW IT IS OVER THERE WHY SUSAN I COULD SEE IT SEE IT I TELL YOU AND OH I DID SO WANT TO BE THERE TO HELP
NEW THINGS OF INTEREST THAT HE WAS SEEING HE SAID NOTHING WHATEVER ABOUT THE OPERATION HE DID SAY THAT THERE WAS A BIG DOCTOR COMING FROM PARIS WHOM HE WAS GOING TO SEE IN MAY HOWEVER THAT WAS ALL WHEN THE DOCTOR'S LETTER HAD COME
AND SUSAN WAS FORCED TO CONTENT HERSELF WITH LEADING HER CHARGE OUT ON TO THE BROAD VERANDA THAT RAN ACROSS THE ENTIRE FRONT OF THE HOUSE THERE THEY WALKED BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH SHE WAS GLAD AFTERWARD THAT THIS WAS ALL SHE DID
BUT SHE HAD NOT REACHED THE HALL BELOW WHEN THE SOBS SHOOK HER FRAME
HE TOLD ME HOW THEY HELD IT THE LITTLE CLUMP OF TREES THAT MEANT SO MUCH TO US AND HOW ONE BY ONE THEY FELL THOSE BRAVE FELLOWS WITH HIM I COULD SEE IT I COULD HEAR IT
AND THE SHOUTS AND GROANS OF THE MEN AT OUR SIDE AND THEY NEEDED MEN MORE MEN TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THOSE THAT HAD FALLEN EVEN ONE MAN COUNTED THERE COUNTED FOR OH SO MUCH FOR AT THE LAST THERE WAS JUST ONE MAN LEFT
THE NURSE CAME IN THEN AND OF COURSE SUSAN WAS BANISHED IN DISGRACE OF COURSE TOO KEITH WAS ALMOST IN HYSTERICS AND HIS FEVER HAD GONE AWAY UP AGAIN HE STILL TALKED IN A HIGH SHRILL VOICE
BUT SUSAN JOHN MC GUIRE WOULDN'T TELL IT TO HIM DON'T YOU SEE HE WON'T EVEN SEE ANYBODY BUT ME AND HE DIDN'T TALK LIKE THIS EVEN TO ME UNTIL TO DAY
AND STILL THRASHED HIS ARMS WILDLY ABOUT TILL THE LITTLE WHITE POWDER THE NURSE GAVE HIM GOT IN ITS BLESSED WORK AND THEN HE SLEPT KEITH WAS ENTIRELY CONSCIOUS THE NEXT DAY WHEN SUSAN CAME IN TO SIT WITH HIM WHILE THE NURSE TOOK HER REST
INDEED I'M HERE SHE CRIED GAYLY GIVING A WARM CLASP TO HIS EAGERLY OUTSTRETCHED HAND HOW DO YOU DO SUSAN WAS JUST SAYING BUT SUSAN WAS GONE WITH UPFLUNG HANDS AND A LOOK THAT SAID
ONLY I MADE IT FREE VERSE YOU KNOW THAT'S ALL THE RAGE NOW LIKE THIS SHE FINISHED PRODUCING FROM SOMEWHERE ABOUT HER PERSON A HALF SHEET OF NOTE PAPER ALONE AN DARK THE STUDIO WAITED
AN MAKE YOU SLIP NO CUBES OF PIG LENT GRAY OR BLACK NOR ANY OTHER COLOR LENT BRIGHTNESS TO THIS DANK WORLD AN HE THE ARTIST THE BRIGHT SOUL WHO BOSSED THIS RANCH
OH YES HE SAID A GREAT DEAL BUT IT WAS ONLY A REPETITION OF WHAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE IN THE LETTER DANIEL BURTON SPOKE WEARILY CONSTRAINEDLY HIS FACE HAD GROWN A LITTLE WHITE THE DOCTOR BOUGHT
LEADING THE WAY THROUGH THE DININGROOM IN THE KITCHEN SHE STOPPED AND TURNED EAGERLY
YES YES THAT'S SO MURMURED MISTER JENKINS VAGUELY WELL IT DID WHY IT WORKED ME UP SO I JEST SAT RIGHT DOWN AN MADE UP A POEM ON IT
SEND THEM IF YOU WANT TO BUT DON'T BLAME ME FOR THE CONSEQUENCES AND WITH A GESTURE AS OF FLINGING THE WHOLE THING FAR FROM HIM HE TURNED HIS BACK AND WALKED AWAY YOU MEAN
WELL KEITH HERE WE ARE JUST OURSELVES TOGETHER THE NURSE IS GONE AN I AM ON HOW DO YOU LIKE THE WEATHER YES I KNOW SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING THE BOY SPOKE LISTLESSLY WEARILY WITHOUT TURNING HIS HEAD
THE VERY NEXT DAY WEREN'T YOU GOOD YOU KNEW HOW I WANTED TO SEE YOU OH BUT I DIDN'T SHE LAUGHED A LITTLE EMBARRASSEDLY
THAT DONE SHE COPIED THE LETTER WORD FOR WORD EXCEPT FOR THE TITLE OF THE POEM SUBMITTED IT WAS A LONG LETTER SUSAN TOLD FIRST OF KEITH AND HIS MISFORTUNE AND THE IMPERATIVE NEED OF MONEY FOR THE OPERATION
THAT EVENING IN HER OWN ROOM SUSAN PORED OVER THE TWO INEXPENSIVE MAGAZINES THAT CAME TO THE HOUSE
AND SHE BEGAN TO READ THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE THEY COME AT NIGHT THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE AN GATHER ROUND MY BED THEY CLUSTER THICK ABOUT THE FOOT AN LEAN ON TOP THE HEAD
AND TO HEAR HIM TELL IT IT WAS WONDERFUL WONDERFUL I KNOW I KNOW NODDED SUSAN IT WAS LIKE HIS LETTERS YOU COULD SEE THINGS HE MADE YOU SEE EM AN THAT'S WHAT HE ALWAYS DID
AND IT WOULDN'T BE EASY TO TO MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND HE'D NEVER FORGIVE IT I KNOW HE WOULDN'T TO THINK I'D TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF HIS NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE
OH KEITH WHY HE'D EVEN FORGET HIS EYES THEN IT WOULD HELP SOME KEITH DREW IN HIS BREATH AND HELD IT A MOMENT SUSPENDED AND HE'D EVEN BE HELPING US TO WIN OUT OVER THERE
IN ANSWER TO DANIEL BURTON'S AMAZED EXCLAMATION
BUT HE'S REAL BRAVE CHALLENGED THE GIRL QUICKLY MAZIE SAID HE WAS I KNOW EVERYBODY SAYS HE'S BRAVE THERE WAS AN ODD CONSTRAINT IN SUSAN'S VOICE BUT THE GIRL WAS TOO INTENT ON HER OWN PROBLEM TO NOTICE IT AND THAT'S WHY I HOPED
AND KNEW THIS AFTERNOON AND THERE IT WAS WASTED WASTED WORSE THAN WASTED ON ME CHOKINGLY KEITH TURNED AWAY BUT WITH A SUDDEN CRY SUSAN CAUGHT HIS ARM NO NO KEITH IT WASN'T WASTED
WHERE I DIDN'T KNOW AGAIN NONSENSE KEITH SUSAN WAS BEGINNING TO TALK MORE LIKE HERSELF GO BACK TO BE SICK OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO GO BACK AN BE SICK LISTEN DON'T YOU WORRY AN DON'T YOU FRET SOMETHIN BETTER IS COMIN YET SOMETHIN FINE WHAT'LL YOU BET
IT COSTS MONEY FOR THAT SUSAN'S FACE FELL
BUT THEY'RE NOT YOU THERE'S NOT ANY ONE LIKE YOU CUT IN THE YOUTH FERVENTLY AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO STAY A LONG TIME AREN'T YOU
NOT EVEN USING HIS CANE TO DEFINE THE FAMILIAR LIMITS OF HIS PATHWAY SUDDENLY HE TURNED AND STOPPED SHORT HIS WHOLE BODY QUIVERING WITH EMOTION SUSAN I CAN'T I CAN'T STAND IT HE MOANED
INTERRUPTED THE MAN IRRITABLY KEITH IS ALL RIGHT THAT IS HE IS JUST AS HE HAS BEEN IT'S MY SISTER MISSUS COLEBROOK SHE'S GONE GONE FOR GOOD
AN TWAS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE SUSAN MOANED TO THE LAW STUDENT
HE COULDN'T DO IT YOU KNOW HE CAN'T WRITE AT ALL HE'S ONLY BEGUN TO PRACTICE A LITTLE BIT HE'D NEVER GET IT DOWN WITH THE FIRE AND THE VIM IN IT LEARNING TO WRITE AS HE'D HAVE TO
AN'T AIN'T WAGES IT'S IT'S SOMETHIN ELSE SOMETHIN VERY IMPORTUNE THERE WAS A SUBDUED EXCITEMENT IN SUSAN'S FACE AND MANNER THAT WAS PUZZLING YET MOST PROMISING
STILL THE EXTRAORDINARY PALPITATING SUSAN WITH THE SHINING PLEADING EYES YES GO ON
THE FAUCET WAS ALREADY A MARVEL OF BRIGHTNESS BUT PERHAPS SUSAN COULD NOT SEE THAT ONE CANNOT ALWAYS SEE CLEARLY THROUGH TEARS KEITH WAS LIKE THIS EVERY DAY AFTER THAT WHEN SUSAN CAME IN TO SIT WITH HIM SILENT
AND IT WAS THE WAY YOU DID IT WITH NEVER A WORD OR A HINT THAT I WAS DIFFERENT YOU DID THINGS AND YOU MADE ME DO THINGS WITHOUT REMINDING ME ALL THE TIME THAT I WAS BLIND I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT FIRST DAY WHEN YOU TOLD
WEARILY INDIFFERENT AS TO EVERYTHING THAT WAS TAKING PLACE ABOUT HIM LAY MOTIONLESS AS USUAL HIS FACE TURNED TOWARD THE WALL AND AT TEN O'CLOCK MISSUS COLEBROOK WENT FIVE MINUTES LATER DANIEL BURTON ENTERED THE KITCHEN
SUSAN I THOUGHT I HEARD WAS MISS STEWART HERE HE DEMANDED EXCITEDLY WITH ONLY THE BRIEFEST OF HESITATIONS AND A HALF DESPAIRING HALF RELIEVED LOOK INTO SUSAN'S STARTLED EYES THE YOUNG GIRL HURRIED FORWARD
I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT THERE TO WALK ANY MORE NOT ANY MORE I DON'T WANT TO GO ANYWHERE WHERE ANYBODY'LL SEE ME SHUCKS SUSAN'S VOICE WAS HARSHLY UNSTEADY AGAIN SEE YOU INDEED WHY WE'RE GOIN TO BE SO PROUD OF YOU WE'LL WANT THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE YOU
HOW IS HE SHE FINISHED UNSTEADILY HE'S WELL VERY WELL HE SEES PEOPLE MAZIE SAYS HE SEES EVERYBODY NOW YES OH YES HE SEES PEOPLE
LOOKING NOT A LITTLE STARTLED AS HE FOLLOWED HER WITH HALF RELUCTANT FEET IN THE STUDIO SUSAN FLOURISHED ACCUSING ARMS LOOK AT THAT
TAKING UP AND SETTING DOWN ONE OBJECT AFTER ANOTHER IN THE AIMLESS FASHION OF ONE WHOSE FINGERS ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY THE MIND WHEN THE DOCTOR HAD GONE SUSAN DID NOT WAIT FOR DANIEL BURTON TO SEEK HER OUT SHE WENT AT ONCE TO THE STUDIO
I I WANTED TO HELP SOME WAY AN THIS IS REAL POETRY TRULY IT IS NOT THE IMMACULATE KIND THAT I JEST DASH OFF I'VE WORKED AN WORKED OVER THIS AN I'M JEST SURE IT'LL SELL IT'S GOT TO SELL MISTER BURTON WE'VE JEST GOT TO HAVE THAT MONEY AN NOW I I WANT TO READ EM TO YOU
HIS FACE WAS ALIGHT ALMOST EAGER I DID IT I DID IT SUSAN AND IF IT HASN'T BEEN MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES I DID IT SOONER THAN YOU SUSAN TRIED TO SPEAK BUT THE TEARS WERE AGAIN CHASING EACH OTHER DOWN HER CHEEKS
NO HE WOULDN'T MIND PERSISTED SUSAN STOUTLY
ALAS DOOMED TO HIDE HIS BRIGHT TALONS IN SMELLY KEGS OF KEROSENE AN MOLASSES BROWN AN STICKY ALAS THAT I SHOULD SEE AN KNOW THIS DAY THERE NOW AIN'T THAT ABOUT THE WAY TIS SHE DEMANDED FEELINGLY
YOU JEST GO HOME AND THINK NO MORE ABOUT IT WHEN THINKIN WON'T MEND IT
WITH DANIEL BURTON'S KIND PERMISSION THEREFORE THE DOCTOR WOULD KEEP KEITH WHERE HE WAS FOR THE PRESENT PENDING THE ARRIVAL OF THE GREAT SPECIALIST IT WAS A BITTER BLOW
NONSENSE A GREAT BOY LIKE YOU BEIN TOO TIRED TO GET UP WHY KEITH IT'LL DO YOU GOOD YOU'LL FEEL LOTS BETTER WHEN YOU'RE UP AN DRESSED LIKE FOLKS AGAIN THE BOY GAVE A SUDDEN CRY THAT'S JUST IT SUSAN DON'T YOU SEE I'LL NEVER BE LIKE FOLKS AGAIN
AND THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER WAY TO DO IT THAN TO TELL HIM OF THESE BRAVE SOLDIERS WHO WERE DOING SOMETHING SO REALLY WORTH WHILE IN THE WORLD AN HE'S SO INTERESTED THE DEAR BOY SHE CONCLUDED WITH A SIGH
THERE WERE TIMES WHEN SUSAN DID GO BUT NOT YET FOR SUSAN WAS THE MATTER CLOSED
FOR BOUILLON SPOONS HAD NEVER MATERIALIZED LOCKS AND DOORS AND SAGGING BLINDS HAD RECEIVED PROMPT ATTENTION
HIM COMIN BACK TO HIS OLD PLACE BEHIND THE COUNTER INSTEAD OF YOUR DANIEL BURTON SHE SIGHED I'D BUY EVERY PICTURE HE EVER PAINTED IF I HAD THE MONEY
ON HIS LIPS THE TIME WORN QUESTION ASKED BY COUNTLESS OTHER MINDS BACK FROM THAT MYSTERIOUS LAND OF DELIRIUM WHERE AM I SUSAN SPRANG TO HER FEET THEN DROPPED ON HER KNEES AT THE BEDSIDE IN YOUR OWN BED HONEY IS THAT
DON'T CALL HIM HE WON'T WANT TO SEE ME NOBODY WILL WANT TO SEE ME NOW I'M BLIND SUSAN BLIND SHUCKS EVERYBODY WILL WANT TO SEE YOU SO'S TO SEE HOW SPLENDID YOU ARE EVEN IF YOU ARE BLIND NOW DON'T TALK ANY MORE PLEASE DON'T THERE'S A GOOD BOY
THERE'S SOME TIMES WHEN IT'S FRANK IMPERTINENCE TO TELL FOLKS NOT TO WORRY SHE MUTTERED SEVERELY TO HERSELF ATTACKING THE PILED UP DISHES BEFORE HER
HE WOULDN'T YOU DON'T KNOW JUST TO DAY HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT ABOUT SOME ONE WHO HAD TRIED TO DECEIVE HIM IN A LITTLE THING BECAUSE HE WAS BLIND AND I COULD SEE HOW BITTER HE WAS
THERE WAS MAZIE SANBORN MAZIE BEGAN BY COMING EVERY TWO OR THREE DAYS WITH FLOWERS AND FUDGE THEN SHE BROUGHT THE LATEST NOVEL ONE DAY AND SUGGESTED THAT SHE READ IT TO KEITH SUSAN WAS SKEPTICAL OF THIS EVEN FEARFUL
YOU MUSTN'T LET IT BE WASTED SHE PANTED LISTEN YOU WANT OTHERS TO HEAR IT WHAT YOU HEARD DON'T YOU
LISTLESS SEEMINGLY DEVOID OF LIFE YET THE DOCTOR DECLARED THAT PHYSICALLY THE BOY WAS PRACTICALLY WELL AND THE NURSE WAS GOING AT THE END OF THE WEEK ON THE LAST DAY OF THE NURSE'S STAY SUSAN ACCOSTED HER IN THE HALL SOMEWHAT ABRUPTLY
I WONDER IF YOU THINK I'D DO IT HE DEMANDED I WONDER IF YOU REALLY THINK I'D CHEAT THAT POOR FELLOW INTO
YOU JEST WAIT AN SEE THE FATE THAT I'VE CUT OUT FOR YOU WE'LL BE SO PROUD WE'LL LAUGH ALOUD AN YOU'LL BE LAUGHIN TOO I MADE THAT UP LAST NIGHT WHEN I LAID AWAKE THINKIN OF ALL THE FINE THINGS WE WAS GOIN TO HAVE YOU DO
THEN WITH ALMOST A GUILTY LOOK OVER HER SHOULDER SHE STAMMERED KEITH I DON'T WANT YOU TO TALK TO ME BUT I DO WISH YOU'D JUST SPEAK TO ME BUT KEITH ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AGAIN FAINTLY AND TURNED HIS FACE AWAY TO THE WALL
BEYOND THE STAIRWAY I HAD TO COME TO SEE HOW HE WAS SHE BEGAN A LITTLE BREATHLESSLY AND I WANTED TO ASK YOU IF YOU THOUGHT I COULD DO ANY GOOD OR OR BE ANY HELP TO HIM EITHER AS MISS STEWART OR DOROTHY PARKMAN
I WISH YOUR FATHER SHE BEGAN SUDDENLY SHE STOPPED
BY AND BY THE NURSE CAME IN AND SUSAN LEFT THE ROOM SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE KITCHEN AND SHE DID NOT SO MUCH AS LOOK TOWARD KEITH'S FATHER WHOM SHE MET IN THE HALL IN THE KITCHEN SUSAN CAUGHT UP A CLOTH AND VIGOROUSLY BEGAN TO POLISH A BRASS FAUCET
TELL ME THAT BUT HE COULD OVERHEAR IT KEITH NO NO DON'T LOOK LIKE THAT SHE PROTESTED HURRIEDLY AS KEITH BEGAN TO FROWN JEST LISTEN A MINUTE IT WOULD BE JEST AS EASY
SUSAN HE CLEARED HIS THROAT AND BEGAN AGAIN HE TRIED TO SPEAK CLEARLY JUDICIOUSLY KINDLY SUSAN I'M AFRAID THAT IS I'M NOT SURE OH HANG IT ALL WOMAN HE WAS ON HIS FEET NOW
HE'S GOT EYES KEITH'S VOICE BROKE A LITTLE
AND I'LL BE POINTED AT EVERYWHERE AND THEY'LL WHISPER AND LOOK AND STARE AND SAY HE'S BLIND HE'S BLIND HE'S BLIND I TELL YOU SUSAN I CAN'T STAND IT I CAN'T I CAN'T I WANT TO GO BACK I WANT TO GO BACK TO WHERE I DIDN'T KNOW
CAN'T I PLEASE AND THIS FROM SUSAN THIS PALPITATING PLEADING PLEASE DANIEL BURTON WITH A HELPLESS GESTURE THAT EXPRESSED EMBARRASSMENT DISMAY BEWILDERMENT AND RESIGNATION THREW UP BOTH HANDS AND SETTLED BACK IN HIS CHAIR
ONLY DIMLY NOW COULD HE DISCERN LIGHT AT ALL IN A LETTER TO DANIEL BURTON DOCTOR STEWART STATED THE CASE FREELY AND FRANKLY YET HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD NOT GIVEN UP HOPE YET
LET HIM GO DOWNTOWN AN COME BACK YOU'D THINK HE'D BEEN TO THE CIRCUS THE WONDERFUL THINGS HE'D TELL ME HE'D SEEN ON THE WAY
I'M GLAD YOUR COURAGE IS STILL GOOD SUSAN BUT I'M AFRAID THE DEAR PUBLIC IS GOING TO APPRECIATE YOUR POEMS ABOUT THE WAY IT DOES MY PICTURES
BUT LATER AT LEAST ONCE EVERY HALF HOUR THROUGH THAT LONG FORENOON SUSAN CREPT SOFTLY THROUGH THE SIDE HALL TO THE HALF OPEN LIVING ROOM DOOR WHERE SHE COULD WATCH KEITH
EVEN TO BEAT SUSAN'S RECORD STEADFASTLY HE RESISTED ALL EFFORTS TO STIR HIM INTO INTEREST OR ACTION AND A DISMAYED DISAPPOINTED SUSAN HAD TO GO DOWNSTAIRS IN ACKNOWLEDGED DEFEAT BUT
A PART OF THIS SUSAN SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING FROM KEITH SUSAN HAD A WELL FOUNDED BELIEF THAT KEITH WOULD NOT CARE TO BE A LION BUT A GREAT DEAL OF IT CAME TO HIS KNOWLEDGE OF COURSE IN SPITE OF ANYTHING SHE COULD DO HOWEVER
SUSAN NO WONDER HE ASKED THE QUESTION WHENEVER BEFORE HAD SUSAN TALKED LIKE THAT SURE IT'S SUSAN BUT I CAN'T SEE YOU OR ANYTHING
WHEN DANIEL BURTON THIS MORNING THEREFORE HEARD SUSAN SINGING THIS SONG HE WAS IN NO DOUBT AS TO SUSAN'S STATE OF MIND A FACT WHICH CERTAINLY DID NOT ADD TO HIS OWN SERENITY UPSTAIRS KEITH
SO SHORTLY THAT MISSUS MC GUIRE OPENED HER EYES A BIT AND WONDERED WHY SUSAN'S LIPS HAD SNAPPED TIGHT SHUT IN THAT STRAIGHT HARD LINE BUT WHAT AILS THE WOMAN SHE MUTTERED TO HERSELF VEXEDLY AS SHE CROSSED THE BACK YARD TO HER OWN DOOR
SUSAN BURST INTO SUCH A STORM OF SOBS THAT SHE HAD TO HURRY TO THE KITCHEN AND SHUT HERSELF IN THE PANTRY LEST THEY BE HEARD LATER
SUSAN YES SIR SOMETHING IN THE MAN'S FACE AND VOICE PUT A CURIOUS NOTE OF RESPECT INTO SUSAN'S MANNER
SO THAT AN EQUALITY IS ALWAYS PRESERVED NO SIR LET FANCIFUL MEN DO AS THEY WILL DEPEND UPON IT IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISTURB THE SYSTEM OF LIFE BOSWELL BUT SIR
HE MENTIONED DOCTOR CLARKE AND BISHOP BRAMHALL ON LIBERTY AND NECESSITY AND BID ME READ SOUTH'S SERMONS ON PRAYER BUT AVOIDED THE QUESTION WHICH HAS EXCRUCIATED PHILOSOPHERS AND DIVINES BEYOND ANY OTHER
JOHNSON WHY SIR THE PRESBYTERIANS HAVE NO CHURCH NO APOSTOLICAL ORDINATION BOSWELL AND DO YOU THINK THAT ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL SIR JOHNSON WHY SIR AS IT WAS AN APOSTOLICAL INSTITUTION I THINK IT IS DANGEROUS TO BE WITHOUT IT
TWO CONDITIONS ARE NECESSARY AND TWO PROPER IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE LAW SHOULD BE ADEQUATE TO ITS END THAT IF IT BE OBSERVED IT SHALL PREVENT THE EVIL AGAINST WHICH IT IS DIRECTED
A MATRIMONIAL THOUGHT IN THE BLITHE DAYS OF HONEY MOON WITH KATE'S ALLUREMENTS SMITTEN I LOV'D HER LATE I LOV'D HER SOON AND CALL'D HER DEAREST KITTEN BUT NOW MY KITTEN'S GROWN A CAT AND CROSS LIKE OTHER WIVES
BOSWELL
IT FIXES CERTAIN MARKS UPON ACTIONS BY WHICH WE ARE ADMONISHED TO DO OR TO FORBEAR THEM
SUCH HAVE BEEN THE PUNISHMENTS USED BY THE RESPONDENT NO SCHOLAR HAS GONE FROM HIM EITHER BLIND OR LAME OR WITH ANY OF HIS LIMBS OR POWERS INJURED OR IMPAIRED THEY WERE IRREGULAR AND HE PUNISHED THEM
HE WAS CONFINED BY A CHAIN WHICH EARLY IMAGINATION AND LONG HABIT MADE HIM THINK MASSY AND STRONG BUT WHICH HAD HE VENTURED TO TRY HE COULD AT ONCE HAVE SNAPT ASUNDER I PROCEEDED
IT WAS NOT THAT THE NATION WAS GROWN LESS FIERCE AND I AM AFRAID IT CANNOT BE AFFIRMED THAT IT IS GROWN LESS FRAUDULENT
THAT LAUGHS AT ALL COMMON PUNISHMENT AND BIDS DEFIANCE TO ALL COMMON DEGREES OF PAIN CORRECTION MUST BE PROPORTIONED TO OCCASIONS THE FLEXIBLE WILL BE REFORMED BY GENTLE DISCIPLINE
HERE I AM SENSIBLE I WAS IN THE WRONG
FOR WHY SHOULD A MAN OMIT TO DO BUT FOR REASONS WHICH HE WILL NOT CONFESS THAT WHICH HE CAN DO SO EASILY AND THAT WHICH HE KNOWS TO BE REQUIRED BY THE LAW IF TEMPTATION WERE RARE
THERE IS NO ARGUING WITH JOHNSON FOR WHEN HIS PISTOL MISSES FIRE HE KNOCKS YOU DOWN WITH THE BUTT END OF IT HE TURNED TO THE GENTLEMAN
BUT IF YOU PLEASE YOU MAY LET YOUR LANDS CHEAP AND SO GET THE VALUE PART IN MONEY AND PART IN HOMAGE I SHOULD AGREE WITH YOU IN THAT BOSWELL SO SIR YOU LAUGH AT SCHEMES OF POLITICAL IMPROVEMENT JOHNSON
ALL THESE CONDITIONS APPARENTLY CONCUR TO JUSTIFY THE LAW WHICH WE ARE NOW CONSIDERING ITS END IS THE SECURITY OF PROPERTY AND PROPERTY VERY OFTEN OF GREAT VALUE
A MAN KNOWS IT MUST BE SO AND SUBMITS IT WILL DO HIM NO GOOD TO WHINE I ATTEMPTED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION HE WAS SO PROVOKED THAT HE SAID GIVE US NO MORE OF THIS AND WAS THROWN INTO SUCH A STATE OF AGITATION
HAS SOMETIMES DEPARTED CANNOT BE DENIED BUT AS IT IS EVIDENT THAT SUCH DEVIATIONS AS THEY MAKE LAW UNCERTAIN
AND WASH IT MUCH AND WITH WARM WATER TO PLEASE IT NOT WITH COLD WATER TO GIVE IT PAIN BOSWELL BUT SIR DOES NOT HEAT RELAX JOHNSON SIR YOU ARE NOT TO IMAGINE THE WATER IS TO BE VERY HOT I WOULD NOT CODDLE THE CHILD
BEING BROUGHT THE OFFICE OF READING IT ALOUD WAS ASSIGNED TO ME I WAS DIVERTED BY HIS IMPATIENCE HE MADE ME PASS OVER SO MANY PARTS OF IT THAT MY TASK WAS VERY EASY
THOUGH THE PEOPLE MAY BE DISPOSED OF IN DIFFERENT WAYS WE SEE IF CORN BE DEAR AND BUTCHERS MEAT CHEAP THE FARMERS ALL APPLY THEMSELVES TO THE RAISING OF CORN TILL IT BECOMES PLENTIFUL AND CHEAP AND THEN BUTCHERS MEAT BECOMES DEAR
OR CONTINUE TO INHABIT THE PLACE IN WHICH THEY WERE BRED THOSE WHO ARE DISPERSED CANNOT BE FOUND THOSE WHO REMAIN ARE THE SONS OF HIS PERSECUTORS AND ARE NOT LIKELY TO SUPPORT A MAN TO WHOM THEIR FATHERS ARE ENEMIES
JOHNSON WHY SIR THAT IS A QUESTION WHICH HAS BEEN MUCH AGITATED
IT APPEARS TO ME SIR THAT PREDESTINATION OR WHAT IS EQUIVALENT TO IT CANNOT BE AVOIDED
FULL OF DISMAL APPREHENSIONS HIS MIND RESEMBLED THE VAST AMPHITHEATRE THE COLISAEUM AT ROME IN THE CENTRE STOOD HIS JUDGEMENT WHICH LIKE A MIGHTY GLADIATOR COMBATED THOSE APPREHENSIONS THAT LIKE THE WILD BEASTS OF THE ARENA
EVEN WHILE HE WAS EXERTING HIMSELF FOR ITS REFORMATION IN SOME PARTICULARS SIR WILLIAM SCOTT INFORMS ME THAT HE HEARD JOHNSON SAY A MAN WHO IS CONVERTED FROM PROTESTANTISM TO POPERY MAY BE SINCERE HE PARTS WITH NOTHING
HAD BUT HIS DESERTS YOU PROMISED TO GET ME A LITTLE PINDAR
BOSWELL BUT WOULD YOU TAKE THE TROUBLE OF REARING IT
I WAS VOLATILE ENOUGH TO REPEAT TO HIM A LITTLE EPIGRAMMATICK SONG OF MINE ON MATRIMONY
WHEREAS WE SHOULD HAVE A FORM FOR MATCHES OF CONVENIENCE OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY HE AGREED WITH ME THAT THERE WAS NO ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR HAVING THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY PERFORMED BY A REGULAR CLERGYMAN FOR THIS WAS NOT COMMANDED IN SCRIPTURE
RUSSIA BEING MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BECOME A GREAT EMPIRE BY THE RAPID INCREASE OF POPULATION JOHNSON WHY SIR I SEE NO PROSPECT OF THEIR PROPAGATING MORE
MY DEAR SIR EDINBURGH DECEMBER TWENTY FIFTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO I WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU DID NOT COME TO SCOTLAND LAST AUTUMN HOWEVER I MUST OWN THAT YOUR LETTER PREVENTS ME FROM COMPLAINING
IT IS A PITY HE IS NOT KNOWING HE WOULD NOT KEEP HIS KNOWLEDGE TO HIMSELF BEFORE LEAVING LONDON THIS YEAR I CONSULTED HIM UPON A QUESTION PURELY OF SCOTCH LAW IT WAS HELD OF OLD
THERE IS NO PERMANENT NATIONAL CHARACTER IT VARIES ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES ALEXANDER THE GREAT SWEPT INDIA NOW THE TURKS SWEEP GREECE A LEARNED GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION
AND IF WE APPLY THIS CONSIDERATION TO THE HUMAN MIND THERE IS NO FREE WILL
HE KNOWS THE LANDLORD DOES NOT LET HIM HAVE HIS LAND FOR LESS THAN HE CAN GET FROM OTHERS IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE SHOPKEEPER SELLS HIS GOODS NO SHOPKEEPER SELLS A YARD OF RIBBAND FOR SIXPENCE WHEN SEVEN PENCE IS THE CURRENT PRICE BOSWELL
SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO PAY ALL THE DEBTS OF THE DECEASED AS HAVING BEEN GUILTY OF WHAT WAS TECHNICALLY CALLED VICIOUS INTROMISSION THE COURT OF SESSION
TO DICTATE TO ME WHILE I WROTE AS FOLLOWS THE CHARGE IS THAT HE HAS USED IMMODERATE AND CRUEL CORRECTION CORRECTION IN ITSELF IS NOT CRUEL CHILDREN
JOHNSON MY DEAR SIR HAD I MENTIONED HIM I MUST HAVE MENTIONED MANY MORE MISSUS PRITCHARD MISSUS CIBBER NAY AND MISTER CIBBER TOO
THEIR CONFESSION OF FAITH AND THE THIRTY NINE ARTICLES CONTAIN THE SAME POINTS EVEN THE DOCTRINE OF PREDESTINATION JOHNSON WHY YES SIR PREDESTINATION WAS A PART OF THE CLAMOUR OF THE TIMES
O BY MY SOUL MY HONEST MAT I FEAR SHE HAS NINE LIVES MY ILLUSTRIOUS FRIEND SAID IT IS VERY WELL SIR BUT YOU SHOULD NOT SWEAR UPON WHICH I ALTERED O BY MY SOUL TO ALAS ALAS
NEXT DAY OCTOBER TWENTIETH HE APPEARED FOR THE ONLY TIME I SUPPOSE IN HIS LIFE AS A WITNESS IN A COURT OF JUSTICE
NEITHER EQUITY NOR COMPASSION OPERATE AGAINST IT A USEFUL A NECESSARY LAW IS BROKEN
SINCE THIS LAW HAS BEEN REPRESENTED AS RIGOROUSLY AND UNREASONABLY PENAL IT SEEMS NOT IMPROPER TO CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS AND QUALITIES THAT MAKE THE JUSTICE OR PROPRIETY OF A PENAL LAW
ON SATURDAY APRIL ELEVENTH HE APPOINTED ME TO COME TO HIM IN THE EVENING WHEN HE SHOULD BE AT LEISURE TO GIVE ME SOME ASSISTANCE FOR THE DEFENCE OF HASTIE THE SCHOOLMASTER OF CAMPBELLTOWN FOR WHOM I WAS TO APPEAR IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS
HE IS ONLY SUPERADDING TO WHAT HE ALREADY HAD BUT A CONVERT FROM POPERY TO PROTESTANTISM GIVES UP SO MUCH OF WHAT HE HAS HELD AS SACRED AS ANY THING THAT HE RETAINS
THAT GARRICK WANTED TO BE COURTED FOR THEM AND THAT ON THE CONTRARY GARRICK SHOULD HAVE COURTED HIM AND SENT HIM THE PLAYS OF HIS OWN ACCORD BUT INDEED
HE THAT IS THUS GOVERNED LIVES NOT BY LAW BUT BY OPINION NOT BY A CERTAIN RULE TO WHICH HE CAN APPLY HIS INTENTION BEFORE HE ACTS
MAY BE CONFIRMED BY MANY AND EMINENT INSTANCES SOME OF WHICH WILL OCCUR TO MOST OF MY READERS WHEN WE WERE ALONE I INTRODUCED THE SUBJECT OF DEATH AND ENDEAVOURED TO MAINTAIN THAT THE FEAR OF IT MIGHT BE GOT OVER I TOLD HIM THAT DAVID HUME SAID TO ME
IRREGULARLY WITH THE MOVEABLES OF A PERSON DECEASED WAS SUBJECTED TO ALL THE DEBTS OF THE DECEASED WITHOUT LIMITATION THIS MAKES A BRANCH OF THE LAW OF SCOTLAND KNOWN BY THE NAME OF VICIOUS INTROMISSION
BEFORE THE FEROCITY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THIS PART OF THE ISLAND WAS SUBDUED THE UTMOST SEVERITY OF THE CIVIL LAW WAS NECESSARY TO RESTRAIN INDIVIDUALS FROM PLUNDERING EACH OTHER THUS THE MAN WHO INTERMEDDLED
WITH SUCH COMPREHENSION OF MIND AND SUCH CLEARNESS OF PENETRATION DID HE THUS TREAT A SUBJECT ALTOGETHER NEW TO HIM WITHOUT ANY OTHER PREPARATION THAN MY
AND MAY THEREFORE BE SUSPENDED OR MODIFIED AS THE COURT SHALL THINK PROPER CONCERNING THE POWER OF THE COURT TO MAKE OR TO SUSPEND A LAW WE HAVE NO INTENTION TO INQUIRE IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR OUR PURPOSE THAT
HE THEN IN A LOW AND EARNEST TONE TALKED OF HIS MEDITATING UPON THE AWEFUL HOUR OF HIS OWN DISSOLUTION AND IN WHAT MANNER HE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF UPON THAT OCCASION I KNOW NOT SAID HE
NO MAN IS SO LITTLE ABLE TO DETERMINE AS THOSE WHO HAVE DETERMINED AGAINST HIM THE PARENTS OF THE OFFENDERS IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT HE USED UNPRECEDENTED AND IMPROPER INSTRUMENTS OF CORRECTION
BUT WHEN IS CORRECTION IMMODERATE WHEN IT IS MORE FREQUENT OR MORE SEVERE THAN IS REQUIRED
NOT SO AS THAT HE SHALL ONLY BE EXPOSED TO RIDICULE BOSWELL FOR MY PART I LIKE VERY WELL TO HEAR HONEST GOLDSMITH TALK AWAY CARELESSLY JOHNSON WHY YES SIR BUT
I FIND MYSELF UNDER A NECESSITY OF OBSERVING THAT THIS LEARNED AND JUDICIOUS WRITER
OTHERS HAVE CONSIDERED THEM TO BE ONLY ARTICLES OF PEACE
WHICH WE HAVE SO LONG PROPOSED I COMMUNICATED TO BEATTIE WHAT YOU SAID OF HIS BOOK IN YOUR LAST LETTER TO ME HE WRITES TO ME THUS YOU JUDGE VERY RIGHTLY IN SUPPOSING
WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO FOLLOW NATURE AND GO TO BED AND RISE JUST AS NATURE GIVES US LIGHT OR WITH HOLDS IT JOHNSON NO SIR
WHERE THE INTERFERENCE PROVED
TOTALLY INEFFECTUAL OBSTINACY THEREFORE MUST NEVER BE VICTORIOUS YET IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THERE SOMETIMES OCCURS A SULLEN AND HARDY RESOLUTION
THAT HE IS IN THE COMPANY BOSWELL YES HE STANDS FORWARD JOHNSON TRUE SIR BUT IF A MAN IS TO STAND FORWARD HE SHOULD WISH TO DO IT NOT IN AN AUKWARD POSTURE NOT IN RAGS
THOUGH THERE SHOULD BE LITTLE PROFIT IN MONEY THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE PROFIT IN PLEASURE AS IT GIVES TO ONE NATION THE PRODUCTIONS OF ANOTHER
THEY WERE OBSTINATE AND HE ENFORCED HIS PUNISHMENT BUT HOWEVER PROVOKED HE NEVER EXCEEDED THE LIMITS OF MODERATION FOR HE INFLICTED NOTHING BEYOND PRESENT PAIN AND HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS REQUIRED
TO OPPRESS A MAN POORER THAN THEMSELVES AND NATURAL TO ASSERT THE DIGNITY OF RICHES BY PERSISTING IN OPPRESSION THE ARGUMENT WHICH ATTEMPTS TO PROVE THE IMPROPRIETY OF RESTORING HIM TO THE SCHOOL
WALPOLE WAS A MINISTER GIVEN BY THE KING TO THE PEOPLE PITT WAS A MINISTER GIVEN BY THE PEOPLE TO THE KING AS AN ADJUNCT THE MISFORTUNE OF GOLDSMITH IN CONVERSATION IS THIS
FOR ALTHOUGH WHEN IN A CELESTIAL FRAME IN HIS VANITY OF HUMAN WISHES HE HAS SUPPOSED DEATH TO BE KIND NATURE'S SIGNAL FOR RETREAT
OF LAW IS PROTECTION AS WELL AS VENGEANCE INDEED VENGEANCE IS NEVER USED BUT TO STRENGTHEN PROTECTION THAT SOCIETY ONLY IS WELL GOVERNED WHERE LIFE IS FREED FROM DANGER AND FROM SUSPICION
NO SIR WHILE LEARNING TO READ AND WRITE IS A DISTINCTION THE FEW WHO HAVE THAT DISTINCTION
A PENAL LAW MIGHT BE DEEMED UNNECESSARY IF THE DUTY ENJOINED BY THE LAW WERE OF DIFFICULT PERFORMANCE OMISSION THOUGH IT COULD NOT BE JUSTIFIED MIGHT BE PITIED BUT IN THE PRESENT CASE
THEY COULD EASILY DO IT WERE IT NOT THAT THEY CAN'T AGREE SO THE COMMON SOLDIERS
THEY HAD NOT YET LEARNED TO CHEAT AND ATTEMPTED ONLY TO ROB AS MANNERS GROW MORE POLISHED WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD MEN ATTAIN LIKEWISE DEXTERITY IN EVIL
I GRANT YOU THAT IN PRACTICE PURGATORY IS MADE A LUCRATIVE IMPOSITION AND THAT THE PEOPLE DO BECOME IDOLATROUS AS THEY RECOMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE TUTELARY PROTECTION OF PARTICULAR SAINTS I THINK THEIR GIVING THE SACRAMENT ONLY IN ONE KIND IS CRIMINAL
A LINE BY PHILLIPS AND A LINE BY TICKELL
THAT DOCTOR JOHNSON'S FAVOURABLE OPINION OF ANY BOOK MUST GIVE ME GREAT DELIGHT INDEED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY HOW MUCH I AM GRATIFIED BY IT
IT IS AS PROPER TO PRAY FOR THEM AS FOR OUR BRETHREN OF MANKIND WHO ARE YET IN THIS LIFE BOSWELL THE IDOLATRY OF THE MASS JOHNSON SIR THERE IS NO IDOLATRY IN THE MASS THEY BELIEVE GOD TO BE THERE AND THEY ADORE HIM
JOHNSON WHY SIR I DON'T KNOW THAT IT DOES
THE LEISURE WHICH I CANNOT ENJOY IT WILL BE A PLEASURE TO HEAR THAT YOU EMPLOY UPON THE ANTIQUITIES OF THE FEUDAL ESTABLISHMENT THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF ANCIENT TENURES IS GRADUALLY PASSING AWAY
FOR INDULGING HIS TALENT OF RIDICULE AT THE EXPENCE OF HIS VISITORS WHICH I COLLOQUIALLY TERMED MAKING FOOLS OF HIS COMPANY JOHNSON WHY SIR WHEN YOU GO TO SEE FOOTE YOU DO NOT GO TO SEE A SAINT
WELL SIR YOU ARE NOW IN GOOD HUMOUR JOHNSON YES SIR I WAS GOING TO LEAVE HIM AND HAD GOT AS FAR AS THE STAIRCASE HE STOPPED ME AND SMILING SAID GET YOU GONE IN
BY WHICH THE DEFICIENCIES OF PRIVATE UNDERSTANDING ARE TO BE SUPPLIED IT IS TO SUFFER THE RASH AND IGNORANT TO ACT AT DISCRETION AND THEN TO DEPEND FOR THE LEGALITY OF THAT ACTION ON THE SENTENCE OF THE JUDGE
I HAVE NOT BEEN UPON THE STAGE AND CANNOT DO THOSE THINGS BOSWELL I HAVE OFTEN BLAMED MYSELF SIR FOR NOT FEELING FOR OTHERS AS SENSIBLY AS MANY SAY THEY DO JOHNSON SIR DON'T BE DUPED BY THEM ANY MORE
OF AN ATTRIBUTE USUALLY ASCRIBED TO THE DIVINITY HOWEVER IRRECONCILABLE IN ITS FULL EXTENT WITH THE GRAND SYSTEM OF MORAL GOVERNMENT HIS SUPPOSED ORTHODOXY HERE CRAMPED THE VIGOROUS POWERS OF HIS UNDERSTANDING
IF I COME TO AN ORCHARD AND SAY THERE'S NO FRUIT HERE AND THEN COMES A PORING MAN
FOR HE RECEIVED ME VERY COMPLACENTLY SO THAT I UNEXPECTEDLY FOUND MYSELF AT EASE AND JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION HE SAID THE CRITICKS HAD DONE TOO MUCH HONOUR
THAT THERE MAY BE INTROMISSION WITHOUT FRAUD WHICH HOWEVER TRUE WILL BY NO MEANS JUSTIFY AN OCCASIONAL AND ARBITRARY RELAXATION OF THE LAW THE END
MEDICATED BATHS CAN BE NO BETTER THAN WARM WATER THEIR ONLY EFFECT CAN BE THAT OF TEPID MOISTURE ONE OF THE COMPANY TOOK THE OTHER SIDE MAINTAINING THAT MEDICINES OF VARIOUS SORTS AND SOME TOO OF MOST POWERFUL EFFECT
YOU WILL FIND THESE VERY FEELING PEOPLE ARE NOT VERY READY TO DO YOU GOOD THEY PAY YOU BY FEELING BOSWELL FOOTE HAS A GREAT DEAL OF HUMOUR JOHNSON YES SIR BOSWELL
HAS NOT ACCURATELY DISTINGUISHED THE DEFICIENCIES AND DEMANDS OF THE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OF HUMAN LIFE WHICH FROM A DEGREE OF SAVAGENESS AND INDEPENDENCE IN WHICH ALL LAWS ARE VAIN PASSES OR MAY PASS
BY ALLEDGING THAT HE HAS LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF JURIDICAL CONSIDERATION
JOHNSON I DO NOT KNOW SIR THAT THE FELLOW IS AN INFIDEL BUT IF HE BE AN INFIDEL HE IS AN INFIDEL AS A DOG IS AN INFIDEL
THOSE WHO BEFORE INVADED PASTURES AND STORMED HOUSES NOW BEGIN TO ENRICH THEMSELVES BY UNEQUAL CONTRACTS AND FRAUDULENT INTROMISSIONS
BUT I TOLD HIM MISTER BUNDERCOMBE AND HIS DAUGHTER WERE HERE AND HE IS RUSHING INTO HIS CLOTHES AS FAST AS HE CAN
NONE I REPLIED I PUT IT ALL ON TO A WAITER HOW CLEVER OF YOU YOU REALLY DO SEEM TO BE A MOST CAPABLE PERSON AND SO MASTERFUL I BEGIN TO FEAR THAT SOME DAY YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY
I THANK GOODNESS I CAN AFFORD TO LOSE THEM IF THEY MUST BE LOST AND I CAN REPLACE THEM THIS AFTERNOON WITHOUT FEELING IT NOW YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE MISTER WALMSLEY

WHAT ABOUT THEM I WANT THEIR ADDRESS OF COURSE REGGIE CONTINUED
I THINK YOU WILL DO WELL TO LISTEN TO YOUR WIFE AND TO TAKE HER ADVICE THERE ARE ONE OR TWO OF THESE LITTLE AFFAIRS YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT ARE NOT ENTIRELY CLOSED YET MISTER BUNDERCOMBE SIGHED HE ADOPTED AN ATTITUDE OF RESIGNATION
I GLANCED ROUND THE ROOM JUST AT THAT MOMENT A WAITER FROM THE RESTAURANT PRESENTED HIMSELF HE BROUGHT ME A CARD UPON A SALVER THE GENTLEMAN ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU THIS SIR HE ANNOUNCED I PICKED IT UP
YOU CANNOT SIR MISTER PARKER TOLD ME EVE HAS A LITTLE BUSINESS OF HER OWN OR RATHER MINE TO ATTEND TO THIS MORNING YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LET HER RUN ANY MORE RISKS ARE YOU MISTER PARKER FROWNED AT ME

IT'S USUAL AMONG ENGAGED COUPLES I PLEADED IS IT SHE REMARKED COLDLY DOESN'T THE MAN AS A RULE WAIT TO BE QUITE SURE HE IS ENGAGED NOT IN THIS COUNTRY I DECLARED
FOR THIRTY YEARS HE WORKS AS A MAN SHOULD FOR IT'S WHAT A MAN'S MADE FOR AND THANKS TO HIS WIFE'S HELP AND ADVICE HE PROSPERS LOOK AT HIM I ASK YOU A BABY CAN SEE THAT HE HASN'T THE BRAINS OF A CHICKEN YET THERE HE STANDS
IT IS YOUR CLEAR SIGHTED WAY OF PUTTING THINGS SHE EXPLAINED SOFTLY YOU SEEM TO UNDERSTAND PEOPLE SO THOROUGHLY I DON'T GENERALLY MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THE NUMBER OF BEANS IN THE GAME MISTER MOSS OBSERVED IN A SELF CONGRATULATORY TONE
I HAVE NO ULTERIOR MOTIVE AT ALL I DECLARED MENDACIOUSLY EVE ROSE TO HER FEET AND CAME ACROSS TO ME SHE WAS WEARING A CHARMING MORNING GOWN OF SOME LIGHT BLUE MATERIAL WITH LARGE BUTTONS TIGHT FITTING
SHE HAS A SON WHO HAS BEEN TRAVELING IN THE STATES AND WHO WAS WONDERFULLY ENTERTAINED BY TWO PEOPLE OF THE NAME OF BUNDERCOMBE IN THE VERY PLACE YOU TOLD ME TO SAY YOU CAME FROM
SMALL WORLD IT IS
ANY CLEW AT ALL I ASKED RATHER HARD TO SAY MISTER SAMUELSON REPLIED YOU'LL BE WONDERING WHAT I'VE COME TO SEE YOU ABOUT WELL I'LL JUST EXPLAIN OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT SOME ONE MAY HAVE ENTERED THE HOUSE WHILE WE WERE ALL AT DINNER
DID I REGGIE ENCOURAGED ME HE PROTESTED I THINK ON THE WHOLE YOU SAID THE RUDEST THINGS TO ME I EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE FROM A GIRL ANYWAY
WITH EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF STOCK TO HIS NAME I SAW REGGIE'S EYES GO UP TO THE CEILING AND I KNEW HE WAS DIVIDING EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS BY FIVE AN EXPRESSION ALMOST OF REVERENCE PASSED INTO HIS FACE AS HE ACHIEVED THE RESULT
IF MISTER BUNDERCOMBE HAD SEEMED ANXIOUS AND DEPRESSED BEFORE IT WAS OBVIOUS NOW THAT THE WORST HAD HAPPENED ALL THE CHEERFUL LIFE SEEMED TO HAVE FADED FROM HIS GOOD HUMORED FACE HE HAD LITERALLY COLLAPSED IN HIS CLOTHES
I'M HANGED IF I UNDERSTAND THIS REGGIE REMARKED LOOKING AT ME SUSPICIOUSLY WHY
THEIR HEADS CLOSE TOGETHER AT THE SOUND OF MY FOOTSTEPS AND PRECIPITATE ENTRANCE MISTER PARKER SWUNG ROUND ONE HAND WAS STILL BEHIND HIM UPON THE TABLE A WHITE SILK HANDKERCHIEF WAS LYING MY DEAR FELLOW HE EXCLAIMED
HE SPENT THREE WEEKS WITH YOU OUT AT YOUR HOME IN OKATA HIS THREATENED ARRIVAL LAST NIGHT WAS THE CAUSE OF YOUR FATHER'S PRECIPITATE RETREAT AND YOURS OH THAT YOUNG MAN
AND HAVE MIXED WITH RESPECTABLE PEOPLE ALL YOUR LIFE SHE EXCLAIMED ALL THE SAME LET ME TELL YOU THERE ARE PLENTY OF CHARMING AND DELIGHTFUL PEOPLE GOING ABOUT THE WORLD EARNING THEIR LIVING BY THEIR WITS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY ARE FORCED TO
I REVERTED TO OUR PREVIOUS SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION EVE I WENT ON I HATE TO SEEM TEDIOUS BUT THE QUESTION OF OUR ENGAGEMENT STILL HANGS FIRE YOU PERSISTENT PERSON SHE SIGHED
MISTER AND MISSUS SAMUELSON WERE BEING ENTERTAINED BY SOME FRIENDS CLOSE AT HAND AND THEY APPEARED VERY MUCH GRATIFIED AT THE CORDIALITY OF OUR GREETING I TALKED WITH MISTER SAMUELSON DURING THE EVENING AND I FELT THAT SO FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED AT ANY RATE
I AM DELIGHTED TO SAY I HAVE RECOVERED
LOOK HERE YOUNG MAN HE SAID SHE IS MY DAUGHTER REMEMBER I AM LOOKING AFTER HER FOR THE PRESENT YOU LEAVE THAT TO ME EVE TOUCHED ME ON THE ARM REALLY I AM BUSY TO DAY SHE ASSURED ME I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING FOR DADDY THIS MORNING
HE'LL BE ROUND TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING SOMETIME ABOUT MY CHARACTER MISTER PARKER PROCEEDED HE HAS ALREADY PAID ME A VISIT I SAID GRIMLY HE WAS ROUND AT TEN O'CLOCK THIS MORNING YOU DON'T SAY MISTER PARKER MURMURED HE LOOKED AT ME HOPEFULLY
THAT LITTLE DIAMOND CHARM OF MINE HAS SLIPPED OFF MY FOB I SAW IT AS WE CROSSED THE FOYER FROM THE RESTAURANT WHY WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO US ALL MY SISTER JOINED IN
EXACTLY MISTER SAMUELSON ADMITTED THE FACT OF IT IS THAT IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION YOUR NAME WAS MENTIONED I FORGET EXACTLY HOW IT CROPPED UP BUT IT DID CROP UP
I FOUND LADY ENTERDEAN PEERING ABOUT WITH HER LORGNETTE FIXED TO HER EYES APPARENTLY SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING LOST ANYTHING LADY ENTERDEAN I ASKED
HE IS ONE FOR THE GAB AIN'T HE HE REMARKED CONFIDENTIALLY TO ME FOR THE LIFE OF ME AT THAT MOMENT I COULD NOT TELL WHETHER TO LEAVE THE ROOM IN A FIT OF ANGRY DISGUST OR TO ACCEPT THE LUDICROUS SIDE OF THE SITUATION AND LAUGH
AND CERTAIN TO BE LORD MAYOR BEFORE LONG HIS WIFE WAS WEARING JEWELRY HERSELF LAST NIGHT WORTH I SHOULD SAY FROM TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS SO MY WIFE'S LITTLE BIT WOULDN'T DO THEM MUCH GOOD EH IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT I ADMITTED
BUT I AM AGREEABLE TO LISTEN TO HIS NAME IF ANY ONE HAS THE MANNERS TO MENTION IT WALMSLEY MADAM I TOLD HER QUICKLY PAUL WALMSLEY I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE ENGAGED TO MARRY YOUR STEPDAUGHTER
I CROSSED THE ROOM TO THE LITTLE GROUP SURROUNDING MY FRIEND AND AS SOON AS I GOT NEAR HIM I TOUCHED HIM ON THE SHOULDER JUST ONE WORD WITH YOU MISTER BUNDERCOMBE I BEGGED THE LITTLE CIRCLE OF MEN LET HIM THROUGH WITH RELUCTANCE
JUST A LITTLE EARLY DINNER SAY AT STEPHANO'S JUST AS WE ARE YOU KNOW WILL THIS BE AGREEABLE TO YOU CERTAINLY EVE ASSENTED PROMPTLY MISTER MOSS WILL TELL US SOME OF HIS LITTLE ADVENTURES MISTER PARKER CONTINUED WITH SATISFACTION
EVE I SAID WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME ANNOUNCE OUR ENGAGEMENT OUR WHAT SHE DEMANDED ENGAGEMENT I REPEATED I HAVE PROPOSED TO YOU TWO OR THREE TIMES
AT ANY RATE HE CLAIMS IT NOW IF HIS CLAIM IS A JUST ONE AND IF YOU CAN TELL ME MISTER PARKER IS A FRIEND OF YOURS WHY THAT ENDS THE MATTER SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED
DEAR ME DEAR ME I HADN'T HEARD OF THIS MISTER BUNDERCOMBE REMARKED WITH INTEREST YOU AND I WILL GO DOWNSTAIRS AND HAVE A LITTLE CHAT ABOUT IT MISTER WALMSLEY HE MADE ANOTHER STRATEGIC MOVEMENT TOWARD THE DOOR
I BREAKFASTED AT NINE O'CLOCK AFTER HAVING READ THE ANNOUNCEMENT THROUGH AGAIN TRYING TO SEE WHETHER THERE WAS ANY POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN IT AND MY FRIENDS THEN I LIT A PIPE
SO FAR YOUR LIST OF GUESTS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY REPUTABLE THE ONLY TWO LEFT MISTER SAMUELSON CONCLUDED ARE AN AMERICAN GENTLEMAN AND HIS DAUGHTER A MISTER AND MISS PARKER WHOM WE MET ON THE TRAIN COMING UP FROM BRIGHTON
HER EYES LAUGHED AT ME THERE WAS SOMETHING SOFTLY PROVOCATIVE IN THEM A NEW AND KINDER LIGHT I BENT OVER HER AND KISSED HER SHE SAT QUITE STILL MISTER WALMSLEY
PAUL DID YOU GIVE US TOO MUCH TO DRINK OR WHAT I AM NOT SURE THAT THIS WAS NOT THE MOST AWFUL MOMENT OF MY LIFE A COLD SHIVER OF FEAR SUDDENLY SEIZED ME I LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER SPEECHLESS
WHERE ARE YOU HIDING THAT'S ALL RIGHT I REPLIED I SHAN'T GIVE IT AWAY WHERE SHALL I FIND YOU WELL SHE SAID WE TALKED IT OVER AND DECIDED THAT THE BEST HIDING PLACE WAS ONE OF THE LARGER HOTELS
WHY ON EARTH BUNDERCOMBE I DEMANDED FOR THE REASON I HAVE JUST STATED MISTER PARKER SAID OBSTINATELY PARKER ISN'T MY NAME AT ALL AND BETWEEN YOU AND ME I THINK I HAVE MADE IT A BIT NOTORIOUS
AND MISSUS BUNDERCOMBE FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER ONLY ENTERED A FAINT PROTEST AGAINST OUR DEPARTURE IT WAS ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND THE STREETS WERE CROWDED WITH EVERY DESCRIPTION OF VEHICLE THE SUN WAS STILL WARM
TOO LARGE TO LOSE ANYWAY I REMARKED CHEERFULLY AS I JOINED IN THE SEARCH WE PULLED ASIDE A TABLE AND I ALMOST COLLIDED WITH ONE OF MY MOST DISTINGUISHED GUESTS SIR BLAYDON HARRISON K C B
ONLY IN THE HOPE THAT I MIGHT FIND THERE A NOTE OR A MESSAGE THERE WAS NOTHING HOWEVER JUST AS I WAS STARTING TO GO OUT THE TELEPHONE BELL RANG I TOOK UP THE RECEIVER IT WAS EVE'S VOICE IS THAT MISTER WALMSLEY
CHAPTER NINE THE EXPOSURE THE NEXT MORNING AT TWELVE O'CLOCK I TOOK A TAXI CAB ROUND TO BANTON STREET THE HALL PORTER WHO WAS BEGINNING TO KNOW ME WELL SEEMED A LITTLE SURPRISED AT MY APPEARANCE
THE PARAGRAPH EVEN CONCLUDED WITHOUT THE USUAL FORMULA AS TO THE POLICE HAVING A CLEW ON THE WHOLE I PUT THE PAPER DOWN WITH A SLIGHT FEELING OF RELIEF I FELT THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORSE
AND IT HAPPENED TO BE A PARTICULARLY LIGHT EVENING AS YOU MAY REMEMBER THERE ARE POLICEMEN AT BOTH ENDS OF THE ROAD WHO SEEM UNUSUALLY CONFIDENT THAT NO ONE CARRYING A PARCEL OF ANY SORT PASSED AT ANYTHING LIKE THE TIME WHEN THE THING WAS PROBABLY DONE
WE NONE OF US FELT THE SLIGHTEST INCLINATION TO INTERRUPT
DETERMINED TO HAVE ME UNDERSTAND THAT A TRIFLING LOSS OF TWO THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH OF JEWELRY WAS IN REALITY NOTHING I STOOD FOR SOME TIME WITH MY BACK TO THE FIRE SMOKING THOUGHTFULLY THEN THE TELEPHONE BELL RANG
IT SEEMS TO ME IS ENTIRELY OWING TO THE CLEMENCY AND KINDNESS OF THIS GENTLEMAN WHO RECOGNIZED MY DESCRIPTION AT SCOTLAND YARD AND BROUGHT ME HERE SAY ALL I'M PREPARED TO ADMIT ABOUT THAT IS THAT IT WAS SOMEHOW FORTUNATE
SOMETHING QUITE HARMLESS AND THIS AFTERNOON I HAVE TO GO TO MY DRESSMAKER'S WE'LL COME AT EIGHT O'CLOCK WE'LL COME ON THIS CONDITION MISTER PARKER SUDDENLY DETERMINED MY NAME IS GETTING A LITTLE TOO WELL KNOWN AND IT ISN'T MY OWN ANYWAY
AND THE FORGED BANKNOTES MADE BY THE YOUNG MAN IN THE ADELPHI THEY WERE ALL DESTROYED AS FAST AS FATHER COULD BUY THEM SHE EXPLAINED HE HAS FOUND THE BOY A POST NOW WITH SOME PRINTER IN AMERICA
LADY ENTERDEAN EXCLAIMED HOW RELIEVED I FEEL MOST SATISFACTORY I AM SURE SHE SAT DOWN PROMPTLY THERE WAS A LITTLE MURMUR OF VOICES MY GUESTS GATHERED ROUND ME I DREW A LONG BREATH
AND HE'S A BIG HANDSOME FELLOW JUST LIKE ME
NOT A SHADOW OF SUSPICION REMAINED IN HIS MIND AS TO MY TWO GUESTS WE SAT A LONG TIME OVER DINNER EVE WAS BETWEEN A COUSIN OF MINE WHO WAS A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT A MASTER OF FOXHOUNDS AND IN HIS WAY QUITE A DISTINGUISHED PERSON
PRESENTED MYSELF AT THE RITZ HOTEL I WAS ESCORTED UPSTAIRS AND USHERED INTO A VERY DELIGHTFUL SUITE ON THE SECOND FLOOR EVE ROSE TO MEET ME FROM BEHIND A LITTLE TEA TABLE SHE WAS CHARMINGLY DRESSED AND LOOKING EXCEEDINGLY WELL
WELL CULLEN HE REPLIED IF MY CAREER OF CRIME IS REALLY TO COME TO AN END I DON'T WANT TO BEAR YOU ANY ILL WILL WE'LL JUST TAKE A STROLL DOWNSTAIRS AND TALK ABOUT IT MISSUS BUNDERCOMBE WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT TO THE LEFT BLOCKED THE WAY
ONE OF US
AND RENEW HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOU AND EVE MISTER PARKER WHISTLED SOFTLY HIS FACE HAD BECOME A BLANK MY WE DO SEEM TO BE UP AGAINST IT HE CONFESSED UNEASILY
DO YOU KNOW THAT THREE THOUSAND WOMEN HAD TO LISTEN TO A SUBSTITUTE LAST THURSDAY AND AFTER I'D SPENT TWO MONTHS GETTING MY FACTS FOR THEM DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF OKATA
YOU KNOW DADDY IT'S MUCH TOO DANGEROUS AND NOT A BIT REMUNERATIVE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT MY DEAR HER FATHER ADMITTED I AM WITH YOU NOT ALL THE WAY THOUGH ONE NEEDS OF COURSE TO DISCRIMINATE
I TOLD HIM YOU WERE A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND A SORT OF AMATEUR MILLIONAIRE A PERSON OF THE HIGHEST RESPECTABILITY EVERYTHING YOU OUGHT TO BE IN FACT HE WENT AWAY PERFECTLY SATISFIED AND DETERMINED TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GUEST THEORY
NOT HE FIRST OF ALL HE WANTS TO TRAVEL WHAT DOES HE DO THEN BUT TAKE UP WHAT HE CALLS A HOBBY HE BUYS AND GLOATS OVER EVERY SILLY DETECTIVE STORY THAT WAS EVER WRITTEN
I TOLD THE MAN TO SEND HIM UP AND IN A MOMENT OR TWO THERE WAS A KNOCK AT MY DOOR IN RESPONSE TO MY INVITATION TO ENTER A SHORT DARK JEWISH LOOKING PERSON WITH OLIVE COMPLEXION
THAT MEANS A VISIT TO THE BAR SHE DECLARED I KNOW YOU MISTER BUNDERCOMBE YOU'LL STAY RIGHT HERE AND LISTEN TO A LITTLE MORE OF WHAT I'VE GOT TO SAY WHO THIS GENTLEMAN MAY BE I DON'T AT PRESENT KNOW SHE WENT ON TURNING SUDDENLY UPON ME
MY GLOOMIER REFLECTIONS WERE AT ONCE FORGOTTEN IT WAS EVE WHO SPOKE GOOD MORNING MISTER WALMSLEY GOOD MORNING MISS EVE I REPLIED ARE YOU VERY BUSY THIS MORNING SHE ASKED
I WAS TOLD OF A LITTLE RESTAURANT IN SOHO THE OTHER DAY WHERE THE COOKING IS REMARKABLE I'M ALL FOR STEPHANO'S MISTER MOSS DECLARED GRINNING AND THE SOONER THE BETTER
THE YOUNG MAN I CONTINUED WILL BE HERE IN TEN MINUTES PERHAPS SOONER PREPARED TO GRASP YOU BOTH BY THE HAND AND EXCHANGE REMINISCENCES MISTER PARKER SHOOK OUT A WHITE SILK HANDKERCHIEF FROM HIS POCKET AND MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD
SHE WAS THOUGHTFUL FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND HER EYES LIT UP WITH REMINISCENT HUMOR DEAR ME SHE MURMURED IF ONLY THEY KNEW THEY HADN'T ANY SUSPICIONS I SUPPOSE ABOUT THOSE THOSE LITTLE TRIFLES
MEANTIME I VENTURED WE WILL DINE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AT THE MILAN MISTER PARKER GROANED AT THE MILAN HE ECHOED WORSE AND WORSE WE SHALL BE RECOGNIZED FOR CERTAIN
MY DEAR WALMSLEY WHAT HAS HAPPENED I OPENED MY LIPS AND CLOSED THEM AGAIN IT REALLY SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY ANYTHING
I HAVE HEARD THAT AMERICANS ARE RATHER SHY ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING ENGLISHMEN OH BOTHER ENGLISHMEN SHE EXCLAIMED STAMPING HER FOOT I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD I'VE EVER HEARD ABOUT THEM I SUPPOSE NOW I SHALL HAVE TO MARRY YOU I DON'T SEE ANY WAY OUT OF IT I AGREED READILY
SIR BLAYDON ALSO WITH AN EYEGLASS IN HIS EYE WAS MOVING DISCONTENTEDLY BACKWARD AND FORWARD KICKING THE CARPET SILLY THING HE OBSERVED AS HE GLANCED UP FOR A MOMENT
ALLURING AND THERE WAS A LITTLE QUIVER OF HER LIPS A PROVOCATIVE GLEAM IN HER EYES WHICH I FOUND PERFECTLY MADDENING I THINK WE WON'T COME THANK YOU SHE DECIDED WHY NOT
I PRESSED ANOTHER CIGARETTE UPON HIM AND LIT ONE MYSELF I DO UNDERSTAND MISTER SAMUELSON I TOLD HIM AND I APPRECIATE YOUR VISIT VERY MUCH INDEED I AM EXCEEDINGLY GLAD YOU CAME
SHE WAS DRESSED IN A PARTICULARLY UNATTRACTIVE CHECKED TRAVELING SUIT WITH A LITTLE SATCHEL SUSPENDED FROM A SHINY BLACK LEATHER BAND ROUND HER WAIST
WITHOUT HAT OR COAT I JUMPED INTO A TAXI AND IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES I WAS MOUNTING THE STAIRS OF NUMBER SEVENTEEN BANTON STREET WITH THE HALL PORTER BLINKING AT ME FROM HIS OFFICE I SCARCELY WENT THROUGH THE FORMALITY OF KNOCKING AT THE DOOR MISTER PARKER AND EVE WERE BOTH STANDING AT THE TABLE
AND THEY WERE AS KEEN AS MUSTARD ON MY TAKING THEM ROUND LONDON HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN HERE NOT LONG I ANSWERED SURE YOU WON'T HAVE SOME COFFEE
AND SHE NEVER SAID A WORD ABOUT ANY OF THEM COMING OVER THEY SEEM TO HAVE MADE THEIR MINDS UP ALL OF A SUDDEN I EXPLAINED THEY SPOKE OF IT AS QUITE A FLYING TRIP REGGIE COUGHED AND STARED FOR A MOMENT AT THE END OF HIS BOOT
WHICH WAS PROMPTLY AND EFFECTUALLY FRUSTRATED BY HIS WIFE NO YOU DON'T MISSUS BUNDERCOMBE PROHIBITED I'VE A GOOD DEAL MORE TO SAY YET I HAVEN'T BEEN DRAGGED OVER THE OCEAN THREE THOUSAND MILES TO HAVE YOU ALL SLIP AWAY DIRECTLY I ARRIVE
MISTER MOSS SMILED DEPRECATINGLY AND JERKED HIS HEAD SIDEWAYS
ALL FOR SEEING MISS BUNDERCOMBE AGAIN RIPPING GIRL ISN'T SHE THEN PREPARE YOURSELF FOR A DISAPPOINTMENT MY FRIEND I ADVISED GLANCING AT THE CLOCK THEY LEFT FOR PARIS BY THE NINE O'CLOCK TRAIN THIS MORNING
OH YES PAPA DO TAKE ME HOME SHE ANSWERED EAGERLY I WISH WE WERE THERE NOW I THINK IT IS THE PLEASANTEST PLACE IN THE WORLD AND IT SEEMS SUCH A LONG LONG WHILE SINCE WE CAME AWAY
COME ELSIE WE MUST GO THE CARRIAGE IS WAITING AND THE TRAIN NEARLY DUE SAID MISTER DINSMORE GOOD BYE AUNT WEALTHY DAUGHTER PUT DOWN YOUR VEIL EGERTON WAS AT THE DEPOT
WHO EXCITED THEIR SURPRISE AND DISGUST BY A REPETITION OF MISS STEVENS SPEECH TO HER MISTER DINSMORE LOOKED EXCESSIVELY ANNOYED AND EDWARD PSHAWED AND WISHED HER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA NO BROTHER
AND I HEARD JOHN AND MISS STEVENS MAID PHILLIS TALKING TOGETHER IT WAS MOONLIGHT YOU KNOW PAPA SHE WENT ON TURNING HER FACE TOWARD HIM AGAIN AND THEY WERE OUT UNDER THE TREES AND JOHN HAD HIS ARM ROUND HER AND HE WAS KISSING HER
I AM REALLY QUITE SHOCKED AT THE SENTIMENTS I THEN EXPRESSED THOUGH THEY WERE SPOKEN MORE THAN HALF IN JEST MISS DINSMORE I AM NOT A CHRISTIAN
SO SHE WENT QUIETLY UPSTAIRS TO THEIR PRIVATE PARLOR AND SAT DOWN TO AMUSE HERSELF WITH A BOOK UNTIL CHLOE CAME IN FROM EATING HER SUPPER THEN THE LITTLE GIRL BROUGHT A STOOL AND SEATING HERSELF IN THE OLD POSTURE WITH HER HEAD IN HER NURSE'S LAP
AND CONTENT TO BEAR THE CROSS HE HAD SENT HER
HE COURTS ALL THE PRETTY COLORED GIRLS WHEREVER HE GOES I SHALL HAVE TO READ HIM A SERIOUS LECTURE ON THE SUBJECT BUT IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO BE SO CONCERNED FOR PHILLIS OH PAPA DON'T SHE SAID TURNING AWAY HER FACE
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT AT ALL IT IS QUITE EXPENSIVE ENOUGH AND SOME OF YOUR WHITE DRESSES ARE BEAUTIFULLY WORKED BUT I WOULD LIKE A LITTLE MORE ORNAMENT YOU WEAR SO LITTLE JEWELRY AND YOUR FATHER COULD AFFORD TO COVER YOU WITH IT IF HE CHOSE
IF HE HAD HIS DESERTS HE WOULD BE IN THE STATE'S PRISON AND TO THINK OF HIS DARING TO APPROACH MY CHILD AND EVEN ASPIRE TO HER HAND ELSIE LAY ALL NIGHT IN A PROFOUND SLUMBER
NO SIR I WON'T ELSIE ANSWERED WITH A BLUSH BUT PAPA SHE ADDED THE NEXT MOMENT MISS STEVENS DOES THAT CONSTANTLY THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE MY DAUGHTER HE SAID GRAVELY MISS STEVENS IS THE VERY LAST PERSON
NO SON ANSWERED MISTER DINSMORE PATTING HIS ROSY CHEEK AND SOFTLY STROKING ELSIE'S HAIR AND IT IS JUST THE SAME WITH A MAN WHO HAS BUT ONE DAUGHTER YOU DON'T LOOK BRIGHT AND MERRY AS YOU DID WHEN YOU WENT AWAY
I HAD ONLY THOUGHT OF THE FACT THAT LIFE IN THIS WORLD IS NOT SO VERY DELIGHTFUL THAT ONE NEED BE ANXIOUS TO CONTINUE IT FOR A HUNDRED YEARS WE GROW TIRED OF IT AT TIMES AND ARE ALMOST READY TO THROW IT AWAY TO USE YOUR EXPRESSION AH
AND HOW MUCH SHE THOUGHT OF HER PAPA TOO HE WAS SO HANDSOME AND SO GOOD EVERYBODY ADMIRED HIM AND THOUGHT HIM SUCH A FINE LOOKING GENTLEMAN SO POLISHED IN HIS MANNERS SO AGREEABLE
DO YOU THINK YOU SHALL LIKE YOUR NEW MAMMA ELSIE ASKED ONE OF THEM IN A CARELESS TONE AS SHE TIED ON AN APRON SHE HAD JUST BEEN MAKING FOR HER DOLL AND TURNED IT AROUND TO SEE HOW IT FITTED
I CAN'T BEAR TO HAVE THEM SAY SUCH THINGS ABOUT YOU SHE EXCLAIMED INDIGNANTLY HE WAS SILENT AGAIN FOR A LITTLE THEN SAID KINDLY I THINK I HAD BETTER TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THESE TROUBLESOME TALKERS
CHAPTER NINETEEN OH WHAT A FEEBLE FORT'S A WOMAN'S HEART BETRAYED BY NATURE AND BESIEGED BY ART FANE'S LOVE IN THE DARK
I FEAR I AM VERY WICKED TO FEEL SO SAD LET US SIT DOWN ON THIS COUCH WHILE WE TALK YOU ARE TOO TIRED TO STAND SAID ROSE DRAWING HER AWAY FROM THE WINDOW TO A SOFTLY CUSHIONED LOUNGE I DO NOT THINK YOU CAN HELP GRIEVING DARLING
NO MISS STEVENS I THINK IT NEVER WAS HE REPLIED OFFERING THE OTHER ARM TO ROSE SHE WAS GOING TO DECLINE IT ON THE PLEA THAT THE PATH WAS TOO NARROW FOR THREE BUT SOMETHING IN HIS LOOK MADE HER CHANGE HER MIND AND ACCEPT AND THEY MOVED ON
I WOULD HAVE YOU TAKE FOR YOUR MODEL THE LESS YOU RESEMBLE HER IN DRESS MANNERS OR ANYTHING ELSE THE BETTER IF YOU WISH TO COPY ANY ONE LET IT BE MISS ALLISON FOR SHE IS A PERFECT LADY IN EVERY RESPECT
SO CROSSLY ELSIE WHAT PAPA SHE ASKED BLUSHING AGAIN FOR HIS TONE WAS REPROVING COME HERE AND SIT ON MY KNEE I WANT TO TALK TO YOU I AM AFRAID MY LITTLE DAUGHTER IS GROWING CENSORIOUS
IT WOULD BE SO PLEASANT TO HAVE HER NO MY DEAR IT WOULDN'T DO HE REPLIED WITH A GRAVE SHAKE OF THE HEAD WHY PAPA SHE ASKED WITH A LOOK OF KEEN DISAPPOINTMENT YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE SAID IN THE SAME GRAVE TONE
HE WALKED BACK TO HIS BOARDING HOUSE CURSING HIS ILL LUCK AND MESSRS DINSMORE AND TRAVILLA AND GAVE NOTICE TO HIS LANDLADY THAT HIS ROOM WOULD BECOME VACANT THE NEXT MORNING AS THE TRAIN SPED ONWARD
SOMETIMES I AM MORE THAN HALF AFRAID I MAKE AN IDOL OF HIM AND YET OH MAMMA SHE MURMURED HIDING HER FACE IN ROSE'S BOSOM WHY IS IT THAT I CAN NO LONGER BE IN LOVE WITH THE LOVES THAT SO FULLY SATISFIED ME
YOU KNOW YOUR PAPA WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED YOU TO MARRY FOR SEVERAL YEARS YET YOU KNOW ALL MAMMA YES DEAR PAPA TOLD ME FOR YOU KNOW YOU ARE MY DARLING DAUGHTER TOO AND I HAVE A VERY DEEP INTEREST IN ALL THAT CONCERNS YOU
AND CONTRIVING SO MANY FRESH ENTERTAINMENTS THAT DURING THOSE FEW WEEKS LIFE SEEMED LIKE ONE LONG GALA DAY MISTER TRAVILLA WAS WITH THEM MOST OF THE TIME HE HAD TARRIED BEHIND IN PHILADELPHIA AS MISTER DINSMORE AND HIS DAUGHTER PASSED THROUGH
SAID ROSE SMILING YOU DON'T WISH ANY SUCH THING ON THE CONTRARY YOU WOULD BE THE VERY FIRST TO FLY TO THE RESCUE IF YOU SAW HER IN DANGER OF DROWNING BUT BEFORE THERE WAS TIME FOR ANYTHING MORE TO BE SAID MISS STEVENS HAD RETURNED
PAPA SAID ELSIE GAZING LONGINGLY UPON THEM AS SHE STOOD BY THE OPEN WINDOW CAN'T WE TAKE A WALK WHEN MISS ROSE IS READY TO GO WITH US MAY I RUN TO HER DOOR AND ASK IF SHE IS AND IF SHE ISN'T
PUTTING HER ARMS ABOUT HIS NECK AND LOOKING IN HIS FACE WITH EYES BRIMFUL OF FILIAL TENDERNESS AND LOVE THAT IS RIGHT MY DARLING HE SAID AND YOU SHALL NEVER WANT FOR LOVE WHILE YOUR FATHER LIVES
IS IT NOT A SIN TO THROW AWAY THE LIFE WHICH GOD HAS GIVEN US TO BE USED IN HIS SERVICE AH PERHAPS THAT MAY BE SO BUT I HAD NOT LOOKED AT IT IN PRECISELY THAT WAY
WROTE A SENTENCE ON A SCRAP OF PAPER AND HANDED IT TO MISTER DINSMORE THE CHIROGRAPHY WAS PRECISELY THAT OF THE LETTER WHILE SLOWLY CONVALESCING ARTHUR HAD PREPARED FOR THIS EXPECTED INTERVIEW WITH HORACE
THAT IS ALL I CAN ASK DEAREST I MUST RESERVE THE FIRST PLACE IN YOUR HEART FOR MYSELF DO YOU THINK SHE WILL COME PAPA SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW DAUGHTER I HAVE NOT ASKED HER YET
AND I WISH MY LITTLE GIRL ALWAYS TO BE RESPECTFUL TO THOSE OLDER THAN HERSELF I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU THE OTHER DAY MENTION SOME GENTLEMAN'S NAME WITHOUT THE PREFIX OF MISTER AND I INTENDED TO REPROVE YOU FOR IT AT THE TIME DON'T DO IT AGAIN
AND HE WILL HAVE MERCY UPON HIM AND TO OUR GOD FOR HE WILL ABUNDANTLY PARDON THE MAN WAS AN ARRANT KNAVE AND HYPOCRITE SIMULATING ANXIETY ABOUT HIS SOUL'S SALVATION ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF INGRATIATING HIMSELF WITH ELSIE BUT
DWELLETH NO GOOD THING I KNOW THAT MY REDEEMER LIVETH I KNOW THAT IT SHALL BE WELL WITH THEM THAT FEAR GOD YOU ARE QUOTING YES FROM A BOOK THAT I KNOW IS TRUE
AND VERY INSTRUCTIVE ALSO HE SEEMED ALL THAT WAS GOOD AND NOBLE AND SHE SOON GAVE HIM A VERY WARM PLACE IN HER REGARD MUCH WARMER THAN SHE HERSELF AT FIRST SUSPECTED
HOW I LET IT BE KNOWN THAT I CARRIED ANYTHING SO VALUABLE ABOUT ME OR WORE IT INTO LONELY PLACES SUCH AS THESE WOODS HE ADDED AS HE RETURNED IT TO HER I NEVER COME OUT ALONE SHE SAID LOOKING SLIGHTLY ANXIOUS AND TROUBLED
MISS STEVENS HAD FROM THE FIRST CONCEIVED A GREAT ANTIPATHY TO ROSE WHOM SHE CONSIDERED A DANGEROUS RIVAL AND GENERALLY AVOIDED EXCEPTING WHEN MISTER DINSMORE WAS WITH HER BUT SHE ALWAYS INTERRUPTED A TETE A TETE
HE CARRIED ON NUMEROUS SMALL FLIRTATIONS AMONG THE BELLES OF THE PLACE YET PAID COURT TO ELSIE MUCH OFTENER THAN TO ANY ONE ELSE USING EVERY ART OF WHICH HE WAS MASTER IN THE DETERMINED EFFORT TO WIN HER AFFECTION AND TO MAKE HIMSELF NECESSARY TO HER HAPPINESS HE HAD READ MANY BOOKS AND SEEN MUCH OF LIFE
SHE CAUGHT IT IN BOTH OF HERS AND LAYING HER CHEEK LOVINGLY AGAINST IT LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH TEARS TREMBLING IN HER EYES I KNOW IT PAPA SHE MURMURED
AND I'VE COME TO YOU TO LEARN THE WAY FOR SOMEHOW I SEEM TO FEEL THAT YOU COULD MAKE THE THING PLAINER TO ME THAN ANY ONE ELSE WHAT MUST I DO FIRST
SHE SAID I THINK SHE MIGHT BE VERY GLAD TO COME AND LIVE WITH YOU AND IN SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HOME TOO AH BUT EVERYONE DOES NOT APPRECIATE MY SOCIETY AS HIGHLY AS YOU DO HE REPLIED LAUGHING AND PINCHING HER CHEEK
I KNOW YOU LOVE YOUR FOOLISH LITTLE DAUGHTER VERY DEARLY ALMOST AS DEARLY AS SHE LOVES YOU ALMOST DARLING IF THERE WERE ANY GAUGE BY WHICH TO MEASURE LOVE I KNOW NOT WHOSE WOULD BE FOUND THE GREATEST
GO INTO THE PARLOR OR TAKE A TURN IN THE GARDEN BY HERSELF BUT IN A MOMENT MISS STEVENS WAS AT HER SIDE FAWNING UPON AND FLATTERING HER TELLING HER HOW SWEET AND PRETTY AND AMIABLE SHE WAS HOW DEARLY SHE LOVED HER
THAT WOULD ADD TO OUR HAPPINESS HE REPLIED GENTLY DEAR PAPA YOU WON'T BE ANGRY IF I ASK ANOTHER QUESTION NO DARLING ASK AS MANY AS YOU WISH THEN PAPA WILL I HAVE TO CALL HER MAMMA
AND WALKING STRAIGHT UP TO MISTER DINSMORE SHE PUT HER ARM THROUGH HIS SAYING WITH A LITTLE LAUGH AND WHAT WAS MEANT FOR A VERY ARCH EXPRESSION YOU SEE I DON'T STAND UPON CEREMONY WITH OLD FRIENDS MISTER DINSMORE IT ISN'T MY WAY
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE SUCH AN ASSERTION AS YOU HAVE JUST MADE WITH THE FACT OF YOUR HAVING THAT LETTER IN YOUR POSSESSION I SAY IT'S A COWARDLY PIECE OF BUSINESS FOR YOU TO GIVE THE LIE TO A FELLOW THAT HASN'T THE STRENGTH TO KNOCK YOU DOWN FOR IT
AND ALTOGETHER IT WAS QUITE AN UNCOMFORTABLE WALK NO ONE SEEMING TO ENJOY IT BUT MISS STEVENS WHO LAUGHED AND TALKED INCESSANTLY ADDRESSING NEARLY ALL HER CONVERSATION TO MISTER DINSMORE
AND OF THIS FACT NO ONE WAS BETTER AWARE THAN HIMSELF HE DID NOT CONFINE HIS ATTENTIONS TO ELSIE AND SOON FOUND HIMSELF A PRIME FAVORITE AMONG THE LADIES OF THE TOWN NO FEMALE COQUETTE EVER COVETED THE ADMIRATION OF THE OTHER SEX MORE THAN HE OR SOUGHT MORE ASSIDUOUSLY TO GAIN IT
BUT WHAT AM I TO DO
MY REPLY SHALL BE SHORT AND SWEET AND QUITE TO THE POINT IT RAN THUS YOUR WARNING AND ADVICE COME TOO LATE MY YOUNG FRIEND
AND THAT WHOM THE LORD LOVETH HE CHASTENETH AND SCOURGETH EVERY SON WHOM HE RECEIVETH IF YE BE WITHOUT CHASTISEMENTS WHEREOF ALL ARE PARTAKERS THEN ARE YE BASTARDS AND NO SONS
BUT FOLLOWED THEM TO CAPE ISLAND A FEW DAYS LATER THE WHOLE PARTY LEFT THE SHORE ABOUT THE LAST OF SEPTEMBER THE ALLISONS RETURNING TO THEIR CITY RESIDENCE MISTER TRAVILLA TO HIS SOUTHERN HOME
AND IT WOULD HURT US BOTH VERY MUCH IF YOU REFUSED TO GIVE IT INDEED MY DAUGHTER I CANNOT ASK HER TO COME TO US UNLESS YOU WILL PROMISE TO DO SO AND TO LOVE AND OBEY HER JUST AS YOU DO ME WILL YOU I WILL TRY TO OBEY HER PAPA
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN DROWNED BUT FOR THE COURAGE AND PRESENCE OF MIND OF MISTER STEVENS WHO SAVED HIM ONLY BY VERY GREAT EXERTION AND AT THE RISK OF HIS OWN LIFE A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS ELSIE WAS PLAYING ON THE VERANDA WITH SEVERAL OTHER LITTLE GIRLS
WALTER LOOKED AT ARTHUR IN SURPRISE COME ART SPEAK WHY DON'T YOU HE SAID HORACE DON'T LOOK SO STERN AND ANGRY I KNOW HE MEANS TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF FOR HE TOLD ME SO AND YOU WILL HELP HIM WON'T YOU
COME HERE AND TELL ME WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT SHE OBEYED HANGING HER HEAD AND BLUSHING I THINK I HAVE SOME REASON TO BE CROSS PAPA SHE SAID I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SUCH A DELIGHTFUL TIME HERE
BEFORE DOING THAT WE SHOULD BE VERY SURE OF GOING TO A BETTER PLACE BUT HOW CAN WE BE SURE OF THAT OR INDEED OF ANYTHING WHAT IS THERE THAT WE KNOW ABSOLUTELY AND BEYOND QUESTION HOW CAN I BE SURE OF EVEN MY OWN EXISTENCE
I FEAR I AM ONE OF THE WISE ONES YOU SPEAK OF FOR I CONFESS I DO NOT SEE THE WAY YET CAN YOU NOT EXPLAIN IT MORE FULLY I WILL TRY SHE SAID YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE A SINNER DESERVING OF GOD'S WRATH YES
I AM WRITING A FEW LINES TO AUNT WEALTHY TO TELL HER OF OUR SAFE ARRIVAL HAVE YOU ANY MESSAGE TO SEND AND LAYING DOWN HIS PEN HE DREW HER TO HIS KNEE ONLY MY LOVE PAPA AND
AND THAT MY CLOTHES SHALL BE OF THE BEST MATERIAL AND NICELY MADE BUT NEAT AND SIMPLE
AND THAT SHE MUST NOT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT ME AS SHE SAID THAT SHE SHOULD THAT I AM VERY SAFE AND HAPPY IN THE HANDS OF MY HEAVENLY FATHER AND THOSE OF THE KIND EARTHLY ONE HE HAS GIVEN ME SHE ADDED IN A WHISPER
AND I SHALL LOVE HER VERY DEARLY FOR I DO ALREADY BUT I CAN NOT LOVE ANYBODY QUITE SO WELL AS I LOVE YOU MY OWN DEAR DEAR FATHER SHE SAID THROWING HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK HE RETURNED HER CARESS SAYING TENDERLY
AND BESIDES YOU FORGET ABOUT THE TROUBLESOME LITTLE GIRL I HAVE HEARD LADIES SAY THEY WOULD NOT MARRY A MAN WHO HAD A CHILD BUT MISS ROSE LOVES ME PAPA
MUTTERED ARTHUR ANGRILY
BUT IF YOU CAN BE CHEERFUL IT WILL BE FOR YOUR OWN HAPPINESS AS WELL AS OURS SHE KEPT HER PROMISE FAITHFULLY AND HAD HER REWARD IN MUCH REAL ENJOYMENT OF THE MANY PLEASURES PROVIDED FOR HER
HE ASKED WITH A SMILE YES
IT WILL BE MOONLIGHT NEXT WEEK SAID SOPHY AND WE'LL HAVE SOME DELIGHTFUL DRIVES AND WALKS ALONG THE BEACH THE SEA DOES LOOK SO LOVELY BY MOONLIGHT
AND BEFORE ROSE COULD RECOVER FROM HER ASTONISHMENT SUFFICIENTLY TO REPLY SHE HAD DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE HALL DOOR ELSIE WAS OUT AGAIN IN A MOMENT JUST AS THE GENTLEMEN HAD JOINED ROSE
YOU KNOW I MEAN MISS STEVENS ELSIE ANSWERED IN A TONE OF ANNOYANCE WELL DEAR AND WHAT OF IT ALL HE ASKED SOOTHINGLY I DON'T THINK THE SILLY NONSENSE OF THE SERVANTS NEED TROUBLE YOU JOHN IS A SAD FELLOW I KNOW
THAT THOUGH IT WOULD NOT DO TO INVITE MISS ROSE TO SPEND THE WINTER WITH US IT MIGHT DO VERY NICELY TO ASK HER TO COME AND LIVE AT THE OAKS ELSIE LOOKED AT HIM FOR A MOMENT WITH A BEWILDERED EXPRESSION THEN SUDDENLY COMPREHENDING HER FACE LIGHTED UP
I DO LOVE HER FAR TOO WELL EVER TO GRIEVE HER IF IT CAN BE HELPED SHE SHALL NEVER KNOW A PANG A FATHER'S LOVE AND CARE CAN SAVE HER FROM AND AGAIN HIS HAND RESTED CARESSINGLY ON ELSIE'S HEAD
I THINK YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER THE COMMAND TO BE COURTEOUS PAPA SHE SAID LOOKING AFFECTIONATELY INTO HIS FACE I WAS WONDERING ALL THE TIME HOW YOU COULD BE SO VERY POLITE TO MISS STEVENS
YOU LOVE HER TOO MUCH A GREAT DEAL YOU'D NEVER MAKE HER SORRY UNLESS SHE'D BE NAUGHTY AND SHE'S NEVER ONE BIT NAUGHTY ALWAYS MINDS YOU AND MAMMA THE MINUTE YOU SPEAK THAT'S TRUE MY SON
I AM SURE HE WOULD CONSENT FOR ANY ONE CAN SEE THAT HE IS VERY FOND OF YOU HE DOESN'T THINK OF IT WE CAN'T EXPECT GENTLEMEN TO NOTICE SUCH LITTLE MATTERS YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A MAMMA TO ATTEND TO SUCH THINGS FOR YOU
BUT SHALL I TELL HER THAT IT WILL ADD TO YOUR HAPPINESS IF SHE WILL BE YOUR MAMMA YES SIR AND THAT I WILL CALL HER MAMMA AND OBEY HER AND LOVE HER DEARLY OH PAPA ASK HER VERY SOON WON'T YOU PERHAPS
FOR WITH ALL HER JOY AT THE THOUGHT OF ROSE MINGLED A STRANGE SAD FEELING THAT SHE WAS GETTING FARTHER AWAY FROM THAT DEAR PRECIOUS UNKNOWN MOTHER WHOSE IMAGE HAD BEEN SINCE HER EARLIEST RECOLLECTION
THEN SHE WOULD PRESS ALL SORTS OF DAINTIES UPON THE LITTLE GIRL IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WAS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO DECLINE THEM AND OCCASIONALLY EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS OR RATHER ALTERATIONS IN HER DRESS
MISTER DINSMORE WAS WATCHING HIS DAUGHTER SHE WAS MAKING AN EFFORT TO BE INTERESTED IN THE CONVERSATION BUT LOOKING WORN WEARY AND SAD YOU ARE GREATLY FATIGUED MY CHILD HE SAID
I AM GLAD YOU ARE PLEASED WITH IT DAUGHTER RETURNED MISTER DINSMORE OPENING THE MORNING PAPER WHICH JOHN HAD JUST BROUGHT UP THEY
I CAN NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF FOR ALL I HAVE MADE YOU SUFFER AND WHEN YOU WERE RESTORED TO ME ALMOST FROM THE GRAVE I MADE A VOW TO DO ALL IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOUR FUTURE LIFE BRIGHT AND HAPPY HIS TONES WERE FULL OF DEEP FEELING
DEAR CHILD WHAT SHALL I DO WITHOUT YOU SIGHED MISS STANHOPE CLASPING ELSIE IN HER ARMS AND HOLDING HER IN A LONG TENDER EMBRACE FOR THE TIME OF PARTING HAD COME HORACE
IS THE CARE YOU SPEAK OF ONE THING OF WHICH YOU FEEL CERTAIN YES AND THERE ARE OTHERS MAY I ASK WHAT SHE TURNED HER SWEET SOFT EYES FULL UPON HIM AS SHE ANSWERED IN LOW CLEAR TONES I KNOW THAT IN ME THAT IS IN MY FLESH
HERE WAS A WILL WHICH ENABLED JOHN BLACKMORE TO INHERIT THE FORTUNE OF A MAN WHO ALMOST CERTAINLY HAD NO INTENTION OF BEQUEATHING IT TO HIM THE WORDING OF THAT WILL SEEMED TO BE ADJUSTED TO THE PECULIARITIES OF MISSUS WILSON'S DISEASE
NOW WE HAVE NO SUCH EVIDENCE LOOK AT YOUR STATEMENT AND TELL ME WHAT YOU CAN SWEAR TO
NO THIRD PERSON IS KNOWN TO HAVE ARRIVED AT NEW INN THE INFERENCE BY EXCLUSION IS THAT THE SECOND PERSON THE WOMAN WAS JEFFREY
THERE WAS NO TRACE OF THE PECULIAR GRAVELLY MUD THAT ADHERED TO MY OWN BOOTS AND JERVIS'S AND WHICH CAME FROM THE SQUARE OF THE INN YET THE PORTER DISTINCTLY STATED THAT THE DECEASED AFTER PAYING THE RENT
THAT HIS WAS A CHARITABLE RATHER THAN A BUSINESS PROPOSAL NOW THAT I KNEW THIS NOT TO BE THE CASE I WAS IMPATIENT TO JOIN HIM AND AS I TRUDGED THROUGH THE DREARY THOROUGHFARES OF THIS SUPERANNUATED SUBURB WITH ITS ONCE RUSTIC VILLAS AND ITS FADED GARDENS
THERE'S ANOTHER AFFAIR THAT I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT RATHER AN UNPLEASANT BUSINESS OH DEAR EXCLAIMED STILLBURY HE PUT DOWN HIS CUP AND REGARDED ME WITH QUITE PAINFUL ANXIETY IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE AN UNDOUBTED CASE OF CRIMINAL POISONING I CONTINUED
I LOOKED DOUBTFULLY AT THE PATIENT I WAS LOATH TO LEAVE HIM DISTRUSTING THESE PEOPLE AS I DID BUT I HAD MY WORK TO DO ON THE MORROW WITH PERHAPS A NIGHT CALL OR TWO IN THE INTERVAL
THAT SAID THORNDYKE COMPLETES THE FIRST PART OF MY INVESTIGATION WE HAD NOW REACHED A DEFINITE DEMONSTRABLE FACT AND THAT FACT AS YOU SEE DISPOSED AT ONCE OF THE MAIN QUESTION THE GENUINENESS OF THE WILL
THE EVIDENCE THAT CONVICTS JOHN BLACKMORE WILL CONVICT HER I HAVE NOT TROUBLED ABOUT HER IDENTITY IF JOHN BLACKMORE IS MARRIED
YOU HAVE TOLD US NOTHING ABOUT HER I HAVE CONSIDERED HER AS BEING OUTSIDE THE CASE AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED REPLIED THORNDYKE SHE WAS AN ACCESSORY MY BUSINESS WAS WITH THE PRINCIPAL BUT OF COURSE SHE WILL BE SWEPT UP IN THE NET
WAS GROUND TO A DOUBLE BEVEL LIKE THE EDGE OF A SPECTACLE GLASS WHICH FITS INTO A GROOVE IN THE FRAME
THIS WAS MY VIEW BUT I MEANT TO HAVE THORNDYKE'S OPINION AND ACT UNDER HIS DIRECTION BUT THE BEST LAID PLANS OF MICE AND MEN GANG AFT AGLEY WHEN I CAME DOWNSTAIRS AND TOOK A PRELIMINARY GLANCE AT THE ROUGH MEMORANDUM BOOK KEPT BY THE BOTTLE BOY
WITHOUT ANY TRACE WHATEVER OF A SQUINT VERY WELL I SAID ON THAT UNDERSTANDING I WILL GO NOW AND I SHALL HOPE TO FIND OUR FRIEND QUITE RECOVERED AT MY NEXT VISIT
AND EVEN GRACIOUS FORMS OF SPEECH SINGULARLY OUT OF AGREEMENT WITH THE CHARACTER THAT MISTER WEISS HAD GIVEN HIM I THANGYOU HE MUMBLED THICKLY
BUT YOU OVERRATE OUR POWERS
IS PROVIDED FOR BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MISTER JEFFREY PAID HIS RENT PERSONALLY AND PREMATURELY TO THE PORTER ON THE FOURTEENTH OF MARCH THUS ESTABLISHING BEYOND QUESTION THE FACT THAT HE WAS ALIVE ON THAT DATE AND YET FURTHER
THEN I SAT DOWN BY THE BEDSIDE AND WITH A VIEW TO KEEPING HIM AWAKE BEGAN ONCE MORE TO PLY HIM WITH QUESTIONS DOES YOUR HEAD ACHE MISTER GRAVES I ASKED THE DOCTOR SAYS DOES YOUR HEAD ACHE MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM SQUALLED
AND TURNED HIM ROUND IN THAT DIRECTION WHEREUPON HE TOTTERED GLEEFULLY TOWARDS HIS RESTING PLACE LIKE A TIRED HORSE HEADING FOR ITS STABLE AS SOON AS HE WAS TUCKED IN I GAVE HIM A FULL CUP OF COFFEE WHICH HE DRANK WITH SOME AVIDITY AS IF THIRSTY
WHICH SUITED US EXACTLY AS WE COULD WATCH THE TRAIN ON BOTH SIDES FROM THE LOOK OUT AND WE DID WATCH I CAN TELL YOU FOR OUR FRIEND IN FRONT HAD SEEN US HIS HEAD WAS OUT OF THE WINDOW AS WE CLIMBED ON TO THE FOOT BOARD HOWEVER NOTHING HAPPENED UNTIL WE STOPPED AT SOUTHAMPTON WEST
JEFFREY IS KNOWN BY US TO HAVE BEEN AT KENNINGTON LANE HIS BODY WAS FOUND ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING IN THE ROOM AT NEW INN NO THIRD PERSON
FURNISHES PROOF IN TWO RESPECTS THAT THIS WAS NOT A WATCH GLASS IN THE FIRST PLACE
IS THEREFORE IN THIS DILEMMA IF HE WEARS ACTUAL SPECTACLES HE CANNOT SEE THROUGH THEM IF HE WEARS SHAM SPECTACLES OF PLAIN GLASS HIS DISGUISE WILL PROBABLY BE DETECTED THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY OUT OF THE DIFFICULTY AND THAT NOT A VERY SATISFACTORY ONE
THAT DEPARTURE COINCIDED IN TIME WITH THE SICK MAN'S RECOVERY OF THE POWER OF SPEECH COULD IT BE THAT MISTER WEISS WAS AFRAID THAT THE HALF CONSCIOUS MAN MIGHT SAY SOMETHING COMPROMISING TO HIM IN MY PRESENCE IT LOOKED RATHER LIKE IT
MISTER GRAVES WAS CERTAINLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MORPHINE AND THE ONLY DOUBTFUL QUESTION WAS HOW HE HAD BECOME SO THAT HE HAD TAKEN THE POISON HIMSELF WAS INCREDIBLE NO MORPHINOMANIAC WOULD TAKE SUCH A KNOCK DOWN DOSE
BETWEEN THE PALLOR OF HIS FACE AND THE REDNESS OF HIS NOSE AND BY THE PECULIAR STIFF BRISTLY CHARACTER OF HIS EYEBROWS BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER FACT AND A VERY CURIOUS ONE
THE SECOND INFERENCE IS THEN THAT THESE SPECTACLES WERE PREPARED TO BE WORN UNDER MORE TRYING CONDITIONS OF LIGHT OUT OF DOORS FOR INSTANCE THE THIRD INFERENCE IS THAT WEISS WAS A MAN WITH NORMAL EYESIGHT FOR OTHERWISE HE COULD HAVE WORN REAL SPECTACLES
IF HE NOTES ANY DIFFERENCE OF APPEARANCE
AND SAW A CUNEIFORM INSCRIPTION HANGING ON THE WALL UPSIDE DOWN NOW OF THIS THERE COULD BE ONLY ONE REASONABLE EXPLANATION DISREGARDING THE FACT THAT NO ONE WOULD SCREW THE SUSPENSION PLATES ON A FRAME WITHOUT ASCERTAINING WHICH WAS THE RIGHT WAY UP
OTHERWISE INEXPLICABLE COINCIDENCES THAT I HAVE MENTIONED I DID NOT HOWEVER FOR A MOMENT THINK THAT THIS WAS THE TRUE EXPLANATION BUT I RESOLVED TO BEAR IT IN MIND TO TEST IT WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY AROSE
WEISS ALWAYS APPEARED SOME TIME AFTER JERVIS'S ARRIVAL AND DISAPPEARED SOME TIME BEFORE HIS DEPARTURE IN EACH CASE SUFFICIENTLY LONG TO ALLOW OF A CHANGE OF DISGUISE BUT WE NEED NOT LABOUR THE POINT
THAT VISIT OFFERED QUITE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS THAT CALLED FOR ELUCIDATION THERE WAS THE PATIENT'S CONDITION FOR INSTANCE ANY DOUBT AS TO THE CAUSE OF HIS SYMPTOMS WAS SET AT REST BY THE EFFECT OF THE ANTIDOTES
AND FOUND MISTER STEPHEN IN THE CHAMBERS BY HIM I WAS INFORMED THAT JEFFREY WAS A LEARNED ORIENTALIST WITH A QUITE EXPERT KNOWLEDGE OF THE CUNEIFORM WRITING AND EVEN AS HE WAS TELLING ME THIS I LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER
EVEN WITH THE AID OF A HANSOM WHICH I CHARTERED AS STILLBURY KEPT NO CARRIAGE I HAD NOT FINISHED MY LAST VISIT UNTIL NEAR ON MIDNIGHT AND WAS THEN SO SPENT WITH FATIGUE THAT I FELL ASLEEP OVER MY POSTPONED SUPPER
THESE GENTLEMEN ARE MISTER STEPHEN BLACKMORE AND HIS SOLICITORS MISTER MARCHMONT AND MISTER WINWOOD YOU KNOW DOCTOR JERVIS I THINK THE OFFICER BOWED TO OUR FRIENDS AND REMARKED
HOWEVER I HAD DONE ALL THAT I COULD IN THE MATTER NO FURTHER RESPONSIBILITY LAY UPON ME AND AS IT WAS PRACTICALLY CERTAIN THAT I HAD SEEN AND HEARD THE LAST OF MISTER GRAVES AND HIS MYSTERIOUS HOUSEHOLD I DISMISSED THE CASE FROM MY MIND
I WAS ABLE TO LOOK THROUGH ONE GLASS OF HIS SPECTACLES AT THE WALL BEYOND ON THE WALL WAS A FRAMED PRINT AND THE EDGE OF THE FRAME SEEN THROUGH THE SPECTACLE GLASS APPEARED QUITE UNALTERED AND FREE FROM DISTORTION MAGNIFICATION OR REDUCTION
AND WE BOTH SPRINTED HARDER THAN EVER AND JUST HOPPED ON THE FOOT BOARD OF THE GUARD'S VAN AS THE TRAIN BEGAN TO GET UP SPEED THE GUARD COULDN'T RISK PUTTING US OFF
AND FORTHWITH BEGAN HIS STORY AS SOON AS WE HAD YOUR INFORMATION WE PROCURED A WARRANT FOR THE ARREST OF BOTH PARTIES AND THEN I WENT STRAIGHT TO THEIR FLAT WITH INSPECTOR BADGER AND A SERGEANT
HE WOULD HAVE LEARNED OF HER DEATH AND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE MADE A NEW WILL OR CODICIL IN HIS NEPHEW'S FAVOUR CIRCUMSTANCES THEREFORE CONSPIRED IN THE MOST SINGULAR MANNER IN FAVOUR OF JOHN BLACKMORE
I HAD DETECTED THE DISPLACEMENT WHEN SHE HAD TRIED TO MAINTAIN THE EFFORT TOO LONG AND THE MUSCULAR CONTROL HAD GIVEN WAY BUT WHY HAD SHE DONE IT WAS IT ONLY FEMININE VANITY
IN LIEU OF A BETTER IT IS THAT OF USING WATCH GLASS SPECTACLES SUCH AS I HAVE DESCRIBED
LIKE THAT THROWN FROM THE SURFACE OF A CONCAVE LENS NOW THEY OBVIOUSLY COULD NOT BE BOTH FLAT AND CONCAVE BUT YET THEY HAD THE PROPERTIES PECULIAR TO BOTH FLATNESS AND CONCAVITY
AN EPIDEMIC OF INFLUENZA HAD DESCENDED ON THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND I WAS GETTING NOT ONLY
BUT MERELY A REPETITION OF THE FIRST ONE DRAFTED IN DIFFERENT AND LESS SUITABLE LANGUAGE IT DIFFERED ONLY IN INTRODUCING A CERTAIN AMBIGUITY FROM WHICH THE ORIGINAL WAS FREE IT CREATED THE POSSIBILITY THAT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES
NAMELY THAT WHICH LIKE AN ORDINARY WATCH GLASS HAS CURVED PARALLEL SURFACES BUT FOR WHAT PURPOSE COULD A PERSON WEAR WATCH GLASS SPECTACLES CLEARLY NOT TO ASSIST HIS VISION THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS DISGUISE
THAT HE WAS JOHN BLACKMORE THEN WE FIND THAT HE WAS A MAN OF NORMAL EYESIGHT WHO WAS WEARING SPECTACLES FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISGUISE BUT THE TENANT OF NEW INN
LOOKS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THE SAME MAN ALIVE I TAKE IT AS EVIDENCE OF GREAT ACUTENESS ON THE PART OF JOHN BLACKMORE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE CALCULATED SO CLEVERLY
YOU UNDERSTAND I SAID IN A LOW VOICE THAT THE DANGER IS NOT OVER IF HE IS LEFT NOW HE WILL FALL ASLEEP AND IN ALL HUMAN PROBABILITY WILL NEVER WAKE YOU CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT
AND A CONVICTION ON THE CHARGES OF FORGERY AND MURDER WOULD OF COURSE INVALIDATE THE SECOND WILL I SHALL ENTER A CAVEAT ALL THE SAME REPEATED MISTER WINWOOD AS THE TWO PARTNERS SHOWED A DISPOSITION TO BECOME HEATED OVER THIS QUESTION
HE REPLIED DROWSILY SORRY T GIVE YOU ALL THIS TROUBLE L KEEP AWAKE
I FOUND MYSELF STROLLING ACROSS WATERLOO BRIDGE WITH THE SENSATIONS OF A NEWLY LIBERATED CONVICT AND A CHEQUE FOR TWENTY FIVE GUINEAS IN MY POCKET MY LUGGAGE WAS TO FOLLOW WHEN I SENT FOR IT NOW UNHAMPERED EVEN BY A HAND BAG
SHE HAD INTERRUPTED HIM MORE THAN ONCE AND HAD ON TWO OCCASIONS BROKEN IN WHEN HE SEEMED TO BE ABOUT TO ASK ME SOME QUESTION I WAS MISTAKEN ABOUT SOMETHING WHAT WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT HE WANTED TO TELL ME
MONTHS IN ADVANCE A PERSON WHO HAS AN INCURABLE CANCER IS A PERSON WHOSE DEATH MAY BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY AND ITS DATE FIXED WITHIN COMPARATIVELY NARROW LIMITS AND NOW OBSERVE
BUT IT SEEMED RATHER UNNECESSARY TO TAKE A FRESH SET OF NOTES AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I RATHER SHIRKED THE LABOUR TIRED AS I WAS AFTER MY LATE EXERTIONS BESIDES I WANTED TO THINK OVER THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING WHILE THEY WERE FRESH IN MY MEMORY
IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY CONFIRM OUR OPINION THAT WEISS WAS WEARING A DISGUISE BUT
I ASKED FOR AUTHORITY TO ENGAGE AN ASSISTANT
SO LOUDLY THAT THE PATIENT STARTED PERCEPTIBLY
APPARENTLY HE TOOK IN THE VERY BROAD HINT CONTAINED IN THE CONCLUDING SENTENCE FOR HE TRUDGED WEARILY AND UNSTEADILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT SPEAKING
NOT ON YOUR EVIDENCE JERVIS THEY MIGHT PICK UP SOMETHING FRESH BUT IF THEY DIDN'T THEY WOULD FAIL YOU HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH HARD BAKED FACTS TO UPSET A CAPABLE DEFENCE STILL THAT ISN'T OUR AFFAIR
THERE WERE ONE OR TWO UNUSUAL CASES ON THE LIST AND AS WE MARKED OFF OUR RESPECTIVE PATIENTS I GAVE HIM THE HISTORIES IN BRIEF SYNOPSIS AND THEN I OPENED THE SUBJECT OF MY MYSTERIOUS EXPERIENCES AT THE HOUSE OF MISTER WEISS
AND HERE I MET WITH A REAL POSER I HAD CERTAINLY SEEN THROUGH THOSE SPECTACLES AS CLEARLY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN PLAIN WINDOW GLASS AND THEY HAD CERTAINLY GIVEN AN INVERTED REFLECTION OF THE CANDLE FLAME
AND THE ENGLISH FINGERPRINT SYSTEM INVOLVE A PROCESS OF REASONING IN WHICH THE MIDDLE TERM IS UNDISTRIBUTED BUT THE GREAT PROBABILITIES ARE ACCEPTED IN PRACTICE AS EQUIVALENT TO CERTAINTIES MISTER WINWOOD GRUNTED A GRUDGING ASSENT
YOU RAISED THAT QUESTION THORNDYKE REPLIED FOR THAT VERY DIFFICULTY PRESENTED ITSELF TO ME AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CASE BUT ON THINKING IT OVER I DECIDED THAT IT WAS AN IMAGINARY DIFFICULTY ASSUMING AS WE DO THAT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN
YOU CAN'T SWEAR THAT THE NAMES GIVEN TO YOU ARE REAL NAMES AND YOU CAN'T GIVE US ANY ADDRESS OR EVEN ANY LOCALITY I TOOK SOME COMPASS BEARINGS IN THE CARRIAGE I SAID YOU COULD LOCATE THE HOUSE I THINK WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY
IF YOU WILL PUT HIM INTO HIS DRESSING GOWN WE WILL WALK HIM UP AND DOWN THE ROOM FOR A WHILE BUT IS THAT SAFE MISTER WEISS ASKED ANXIOUSLY QUITE SAFE I ANSWERED I WILL WATCH HIS PULSE CAREFULLY
AS IF THE TROUSERS HAD BEEN TURNED UP HALF WAY TO THE KNEES THIS APPEARANCE IS QUITE UNDERSTANDABLE IF WE SUPPOSE THAT THE TROUSERS WERE WORN UNDER A SKIRT AND WERE TURNED UP SO THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE ACCIDENTALLY SEEN OTHERWISE IT IS QUITE INCOMPREHENSIBLE
ONE EVENING AS WE WERE WRITING UP THE DAY BOOK STILLBURY REMARKED I ALMOST THINK JERVIS I COULD MANAGE BY MYSELF NOW
AND WHO GAVE HIM THAT POISONOUS DOSE I VERY STRONGLY SUSPECT THAT'S NO GOOD SIR
THERE OUGHT NOT TO BE ANY DELAY SAID I THERE NEEDN'T BE I SHALL LOOK IN ON MISSUS WACKFORD AND YOU HAVE TO SEE THE RUMMEL CHILDREN WE SHALL PASS THE STATION ON OUR WAY
AND FORGED HIS SIGNATURE TO A FALSE WILL SEEMED WILDLY IMPROBABLE ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE BODY BUT IT INVOLVED NO ACTUAL IMPOSSIBILITY AND IT OFFERED A COMPLETE EXPLANATION OF THE
WHEN MISTER STEPHEN WAS GONE JERVIS AND I LOOKED OVER THE CHAMBERS THOROUGHLY AND THEN ANOTHER CURIOUS FACT CAME TO LIGHT ON THE WALL
TO RAISE ANY QUESTIONS IN DETAIL AT THE INQUEST THE PUBLICITY OF A TRIAL FOR MURDER WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY UNPLEASANT FOR YOU
BUT JOHN WAS PERSONATING JEFFREY AND WAS MADE UP TO RESEMBLE HIM VERY CLOSELY IF JEFFREY WERE UNDISGUISED THE TWO MEN WOULD BE ALMOST EXACTLY ALIKE WHICH WOULD BE VERY NOTICEABLE IN ANY CASE AND SUSPICIOUS AFTER THE DEATH OF ONE OF THEM THEREFORE
PUT YOURSELF IN THE PORTER'S PLACE AND FOLLOW HIS MENTAL PROCESSES HE IS INFORMED THAT A DEAD MAN IS LYING ON THE BED IN MISTER BLACKMORE'S ROOMS NATURALLY HE ASSUMES THAT THE DEAD MAN IS MISTER BLACKMORE WHO BY THE WAY
OF MISTER JEFFREY'S DEATH MISSUS WILSON DIED ON THE TWELFTH OF MARCH MISTER JEFFREY WAS FOUND DEAD ON THE FIFTEENTH OF MARCH HAVING APPARENTLY DIED ON THE FOURTEENTH ON WHICH DAY HE WAS SEEN ALIVE
BUT PROPHYLAXIS IN THE SENSE IN WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE IN LEGAL PRACTICE
I WILL SAY GOOD NIGHT I HOPE YOU WON'T THINK ME VERY UNCEREMONIOUS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING ME AS I HAVE SAID PROFOUNDLY ASTONISHED THAT HE SHOULD CONSIDER ANY BUSINESS
I THINK THERE IS NO DOUBT OF IT REPLIED THORNDYKE THEN SAID MARCHMONT WE WILL HEAR THE REST OF THE ARGUMENT IF YOU PLEASE VERY WELL SAID THORNDYKE AS THE EVIDENCE STANDS WE HAVE PROVED THAT JEFFREY BLACKMORE
OR TURNING OUT HALF AWAKE TO THE HIDEOUS JANGLE OF THE NIGHT BELL IT WAS VERY PROVOKING FOR MONTHS I HAD RESISTED THORNDYKE'S PERSUASION TO GIVE UP GENERAL PRACTICE AND JOIN HIM NOT FROM LACK OF INCLINATION BUT FROM A DEEP SUSPICION THAT HE WAS THINKING OF MY WANTS RATHER THAN HIS OWN
WELL OF COURSE WE RACED DOWN THE STAIRS LIKE ACROBATS BUT BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE BOTTOM THE CAB WAS OFF WITH A FINE START WE RAN OUT INTO VICTORIA STREET AND THERE WE COULD SEE IT HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET AND GOING LIKE A CHARIOT RACE WE MANAGED TO PICK UP ANOTHER HANSOM
HE WAS NOT BLIND THOUGH HIS SIGHT WAS DEFECTIVE THE FRAME WAS THIRTY INCHES LONG AND THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS NEARLY AN INCH IN LENGTH ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE D EIGHTEEN LETTERS OF SNELLEN'S TEST TYPES
THORNDYKE SMILED GENIALLY I THINK HE FORGAVE WINWOOD EVERYTHING FOR THAT REMARK YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT SIR HE SAID IT DOES AND FOR THAT REASON THE DEMONSTRATION IS NOT ABSOLUTE BUT WE MUST NOT FORGET
HA EXCLAIMED THORNDYKE THIS FELLOW WAS WELL UP IN ALKALOIDAL POISONS IT SEEMS
GLOOMILY WONDERING WHETHER THE BLACK DEATH HAD MADE A SUDDEN REAPPEARANCE IN ENGLAND I HURRIED TO THE DINING ROOM AND MADE A HASTY BREAKFAST INTERRUPTED AT INTERVALS BY THE APPARITION OF THE BOTTLE BOY TO ANNOUNCE NEW MESSAGES THE FIRST TWO OR THREE VISITS SOLVED THE MYSTERY
I CAUGHT FREQUENT GLIMPSES OF THE HOUSEKEEPER'S FACE BUT IT WAS NEARLY ALWAYS IN PROFILE
I WILL GO NOW AND ATTEND TO SOME RATHER IMPORTANT BUSINESS THAT I HAVE HAD TO LEAVE UNFINISHED MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU ALL THE ASSISTANCE THAT YOU REQUIRE AND WILL ORDER THE CARRIAGE WHEN YOU THINK IT SAFE TO LEAVE THE PATIENT IN CASE I SHOULD NOT SEE YOU AGAIN
AND WHOM WE WILL FOR THE PRESENT ASSUME TO HAVE BEEN JOHN BLACKMORE WAS A MAN WITH NORMAL EYESIGHT WHO WORE SPECTACLES FOR DISGUISE JOHN BLACKMORE DID NOT RESIDE AT NEW INN
THE OFFICER SMILED FAINTLY AND FIXED AN ABSTRACTED GAZE ON THE CLOCK YOU COULD SIR HE REPLIED I HAVE NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT YOU COULD I COULDN'T
NOT KNOWN TO OR ANTICIPATED BY THE TESTATOR JOHN BLACKMORE MIGHT BECOME THE PRINCIPAL BENEFICIARY CONTRARY TO THE OBVIOUS WISHES OF THE TESTATOR THE NEXT POINT THAT IMPRESSED ME WAS THE MANNER OF MISSUS WILSON'S DEATH
IT CONCLUSIVELY DISPROVES WHAT IT WAS INTENDED TO PROVE THAT JEFFREY DIED BY HIS OWN HAND YES I SEE THAT SAID STEPHEN AND THEN AFTER A PAUSE HE ASKED DID YOU IDENTIFY MISSUS SCHALLIBAUM
HE ANSWERED WITH A FAINT SMILE NOT DEAF YOU KNOW YES HEAD ACHES A GOOD DEAL BUT I THING THIS GENNLEMAN MISTAKES HE SAYS YOU ARE TO KEEP AWAKE YOU MUSTN'T GO TO SLEEP AGAIN AND YOU ARE NOT TO CLOSE YOUR EYES
SUITED TO THE STATE OF HIS VISION THESE ARE INFERENCES BY THE WAY TO WHICH WE MAY RETURN BUT THESE GLASSES FURNISH A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT SUGGESTION ON THE FLOOR OF THE BEDROOM AT NEW INN I FOUND SOME FRAGMENTS OF GLASS WHICH HAD BEEN TRODDEN ON
AND WE HAD TO SUPPORT HIM BY HIS ARMS AS WE URGED HIM FORWARD BUT PRESENTLY HIS TRAILING LEGS BEGAN TO MAKE DEFINITE WALKING MOVEMENTS AND AFTER ONE OR TWO TURNS UP AND DOWN THE ROOM HE WAS NOT ONLY ABLE PARTLY TO SUPPORT HIS WEIGHT
THESE SPECTACLES HAD VERY PECULIAR OPTICAL PROPERTIES WHEN YOU LOOKED THROUGH THEM THEY HAD THE PROPERTIES OF PLAIN GLASS WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THEM THEY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF LENSES BUT ONLY ONE KIND OF GLASS POSSESSES THESE PROPERTIES
HOWEVER I TOOK A CHANCE I REMEMBERED THAT THE SOUTHAMPTON EXPRESS WAS DUE TO START ABOUT THIS TIME AND I TOOK A SHORT CUT ACROSS THE LINES AND MADE FOR THE PLATFORM THAT IT STARTS FROM
AND ENDS BY BEING A CHEAT GWYNPLAINE DREAMED HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN WOMAN
AND FROM WHENCE EMANATED SUCH RAYS OF GLORY THAT I SHUT MY EYES THIS INEFFACEABLE PEERAGE THIS IMPREGNABLE FORTRESS OF THE FORTUNATE I ENTER I AM IN IT I AM OF IT
HE WHO HAS SEEN THE BASQUE COUNTRY WISHES TO SEE IT AGAIN IT IS
AND LEFT BY THE DUTCHMEN WHO WERE ALL DEAD AND THAT THE CHIMNEY WAS BUILT OF A BARREL WITH THE END KNOCKED OUT SUNK INTO THE ROOF I DON'T UNDERSTAND MUCH OF THY RIGMAROLE
SUPPORTED FROM BENEATH BY THE THUMB POINTED OUT HORIZONTALLY THE ARM THE THUMB AND THE FOREFINGER DREW A SQUARE AGAINST THE SKY AT THE POINT OF JUNCTURE
OWNS LOWTHER IN WESTMORLAND WHICH HAS A MAGNIFICENT APPROACH
THERE WERE THE CHIMNEYS OF WHICH HE HAD SEEN THE SMOKE NO SMOKE AROSE FROM THEM NOW HE WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED THE HOUSES HE CAME TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF A TOWN AN OPEN STREET
HE WHO FEARS EVERYTHING FEARS NOTHING HE WOULD STRIKE THE SPHYNX HE DEFIES THE UNKNOWN GWYNPLAINE RENEWED THE NOISE IN EVERY POSSIBLE FORM STOPPING RESUMING UNWEARYING IN THE SHOUTS AND APPEALS
AND MUST BE HELD UNBROKEN TO GUIDE HIM OUT OF IT NOW AND THEN HE SHOUTED HO ANY ONE THERE NO ONE ANSWERED THE ROOMS NEVER CAME TO AN END ALL WAS DESERTED SILENT SPLENDID SINISTER
PLACE IN A ROUND ROOM A PARLIAMENT WHICH HAS BEEN HITHERTO HELD IN A SQUARE ROOM AND IT WILL NO LONGER BE THE SAME THING A CHANGE IN THE SHAPE OF THE SHELL CHANGES THE SHAPE OF THE FISH INSIDE
SHE HAD DONE US THE FAVOUR TO EXIST AND FOR HER KINDNESS IN BECOMING A PUBLIC SCANDAL THEY PAID HER MILLIONS SHE HAD ESTATES AND CASTLES WARRENS PARKS LAKES FORESTS AND I KNOW NOT WHAT BESIDES AND WITH ALL THAT
WAS INTENSE HE DID NOT FORM EVEN IN HIS DREAMS ANY HOPE OF REACHING THE HEIGHTS WHERE THE DUCHESS DWELT LUCKILY FOR HIM THE VIBRATION OF SUCH LADDERS OF FANCY IF EVER WE PUT OUR FOOT UPON THEM
GIDDINESS INVADED HIM HE MORE THAN CONSENTED TO ITS APPROACH HE WELCOMED IT THIS WAS THE EFFECT OF PREVIOUS AND LONG CONTINUED THIRST ARE WE AN ACCOMPLICE OF THE CUP WHICH DEPRIVES US OF REASON
THEN THE BIER THEN THE MAN WITH THE SPADE THEN THE CHAPLAIN WITH HIS TORCH AND HIS BOOK AND THE GATE CLOSED THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT BUT A HAZE OF LIGHT ABOVE THE WALL A MUTTERING WAS HEARD
BESIDES TO THE PARTITION WERE ATTACHED SOME BOARDS ON BRACKETS AND SOME HOOKS FROM WHICH HUNG A VARIETY OF THINGS ON THE BOARDS AND NAILS WERE ROWS OF GLASSES COPPERS AN ALEMBIC
THEN SOME DULL SOUNDS DOUBTLESS THE CHAPLAIN AND THE GRAVEDIGGER THE ONE THROWING ON THE COFFIN SOME VERSES OF SCRIPTURE THE OTHER SOME CLODS OF EARTH THE MUTTERING CEASED THE HEAVY SOUNDS CEASED
JUST LIKE ANY ONE ELSE HE WOULD GAILY SET FIRE TO A COT OF WOODWORK AND THATCH AND JUST SCORCH THOSE WITHIN BUT HE WOULD REBUILD THEIR HOUSES IN STONE HE INSULTED TWO LADIES ONE WAS UNMARRIED HE GAVE HER A PORTION THE OTHER WAS MARRIED HE HAD HER HUSBAND APPOINTED CHAPLAIN

AND UPON WHOSE FOREHEAD THE DEALER HAD IMPRINTED A FLEUR DE LIS WITH A HOT IRON
BEARS TO HIM THE VAGUE RESEMBLANCE OF A REFLECTION LIKE HIM SHE PLAYS AT A GREAT REIGN SHE HAS HER MONUMENTS HER ARTS HER VICTORIES HER CAPTAINS HER MEN OF LETTERS HER PRIVY PURSE TO PENSION CELEBRITIES HER GALLERY OF CHEFS D'OEUVRE
NOTHING DECEIVES SO MUCH AS THE FACE OF FORTUNE IS SHE PROVIDENCE IS SHE FATALITY A BRIGHTNESS MAY NOT BE A BRIGHTNESS BECAUSE LIGHT IS TRUTH AND A GLEAM MAY BE A DECEIT YOU BELIEVE THAT IT LIGHTS YOU
WHICH ABSORBED THEM THE REJECTED FOUND A REFUGE IN EACH OTHER TWO BLANKS COMBINING FILLED EACH OTHER UP THEY HELD TOGETHER BY WHAT THEY LACKED IN THAT IN WHICH ONE WAS POOR
PHILIP STANHOPE EARL OF CHESTERFIELD
PUTTING THE WOLF BEYOND THE PROTECTION OF THE LAW THEY MOVED FOR SOMETHING LIKE THE IMPRISONMENT OF GWYNPLAINE AND THE EXECUTION OF THE WOLF OR AT ANY RATE FOR THEIR BANISHMENT THE QUESTION WAS ONE OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE THE DANGER TO PERSONS PASSING
NO BREATH WAS HEARD AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROADS AT THE ENTRANCE OF RINGSTEAD BAY YOU COULD JUST PERCEIVE A FLOTILLA OF SHARK FISHING BOATS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY OUT OF THEIR RECKONING
WHAT ARE WE SKETCHING IN THESE FEW PRELIMINARY PAGES A CHAPTER IN THE MOST TERRIBLE OF BOOKS A BOOK WHICH MIGHT BE ENTITLED THE FARMING OF THE UNHAPPY BY THE HAPPY
NINE VISCOUNTS OF WHOM HEREFORD WAS PREMIER AND LONSDALE JUNIOR AND SIXTY TWO BARONS OF WHOM ABERGAVENNY WAS PREMIER AND HERVEY JUNIOR
THE MANUFACTURE OF MONSTERS WAS PRACTISED ON A LARGE SCALE AND COMPRISED VARIOUS BRANCHES THE SULTAN REQUIRED THEM SO DID THE POPE
PREDICTED THAT BEING THE ELDER SISTER OF FIRE SHE WOULD BE QUEEN AND SO SHE WAS THANKS TO ASTROLOGY AND THE REVOLUTION OF SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SHE HAD THE HUMILIATION OF HAVING ONLY GILBERT ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY FOR GODFATHER TO BE GODCHILD OF THE POPE WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE IN ENGLAND
HAUGHTY INACCESSIBLE AND AUDACIOUS HE ADDRESSED SONNETS TO HER WHICH JOSIANA SOMETIMES READ IN THESE SONNETS HE DECLARED THAT TO POSSESS JOSIANA WOULD BE TO RISE TO THE STARS WHICH DID NOT PREVENT HIS ALWAYS PUTTING THE ASCENT OFF TO THE FOLLOWING YEAR
APPARENTLY HE MADE MUCH MORE WAY THAN WAS NECESSARY HE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCE ON THE PLAINS WHERE BINCLEAVES FARM WAS AFTERWARDS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN WHAT ARE NOW CALLED SPRING GARDENS AND THE PARSONAGE HOUSE
THOMAS HERBERT EARL OF PEMBROKE AND MONTGOMERY THE CLERK BOWED TO LORD PEMBROKE LORD PEMBROKE TOUCHED HIS HAT THE CLERK RESUMED JOHN HOLLES DUKE OF NEWCASTLE THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE NODDED
THENCEFORWARD THE SLIGHTEST FALL WOULD BE DEATH A FALSE STEP OPENED FOR HIM A TOMB HE MUST NOT SLIP HE HAD NOT STRENGTH TO RISE EVEN TO HIS KNEES NOW EVERYTHING WAS SLIPPERY
GALDEAZUN WENT FORWARD
THEY HAVE HUGE ASSES WHICH THEY BEDIZEN WITH BELLS AND HUGE OXEN ON WHICH THEY PUT HEAD DRESSES OF FEATHERS THEIR COACHES WHICH YOU CAN HEAR GRINDING THE WHEELS TWO LEAGUES OFF ARE ILLUMINATED
ALL ITS LETHARGIES MINGLE THEIR NIGHTMARES ITS SLUMBERS ARE A CROWD AND FROM ITS HUMAN BODIES LYING PRONE THERE ARISES A VAPOUR OF DREAMS SLEEP HAS GLOOMY ASSOCIATES BEYOND THIS LIFE
IN IT THERE IS ENOUGH TO DECEIVE THE EYE ADD GOD SAVE THE QUEEN WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM LULLI AND THE ENSEMBLE BECOMES AN ILLUSION NOT A PERSONAGE IS MISSING CHRISTOPHER WREN IS A VERY PASSABLE MANSARD SOMERS IS AS GOOD AS LAMOIGNON ANNE HAS A RACINE IN DRYDEN
THE MAN WAS GWYNPLAINE HE WAS MAKING HIS ESCAPE WHERE WAS HE HE DID NOT KNOW WE HAVE SAID THAT THE SOUL HAS ITS CYCLONES FEARFUL WHIRLWINDS IN WHICH HEAVEN
LOOK AT MY ARM OBSERVE THE DESIGN I AM LACENAIRE SEE A TEMPLE OF LOVE AND A BURNING HEART PIERCED THROUGH WITH AN ARROW
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT SAID I BUT I AM IMPATIENT TO HEAR WHAT REMAINS WHY IT IS MANIFEST THAT ALL THE OTHERS ARE RELATIVE TO THE GOOD
THOU DIDST MAINTAIN ALSO THAT GOD RULES THE UNIVERSE BY THE GOVERNANCE OF GOODNESS THAT ALL THINGS OBEY HIM WILLINGLY AND THAT EVIL HAS NO EXISTENCE IN NATURE AND ALL THIS
TIS PLAIN TO THE BLIND SAID I THOU DIDST POINT IT OUT EVEN NOW IN SEEKING TO UNFOLD THE CAUSES OF THE FALSE
AND FROM THIS THOU DIDST GO ON TO ADD AS BY THE WAY THE PROOF THAT NO ONE WOULD BE HAPPY UNLESS HE WERE LIKEWISE GOD AGAIN THOU DIDST SAY THAT THE VERY FORM OF GOOD WAS THE ESSENCE BOTH OF GOD
INSTEAD OF WHICH IN A WAY OTHER THAN IS AGREEABLE TO ITS NATURE IT I WILL NOT SAY FULFILS ITS FUNCTION BUT FEIGNS TO FULFIL IT WHICH OF THESE TWO WOULD IN THY VIEW BE THE STRONGER I GUESS THY MEANING BUT I PRAY THEE
IT IS NOT FOR YOU TO BE DISSOLVED IN DELIGHTS OR ENFEEBLED BY PLEASURE YE CLOSE IN CONFLICT YEA IN CONFLICT MOST SHARP WITH ALL FORTUNE'S VICISSITUDES LEST YE SUFFER FOUL FORTUNE TO OVERWHELM OR FAIR FORTUNE TO CORRUPT YOU
IN ANOTHER BY PURE INTELLIGENCE SENSE JUDGES FIGURE CLOTHED IN MATERIAL SUBSTANCE IMAGINATION FIGURE ALONE WITHOUT MATTER THOUGHT TRANSCENDS THIS AGAIN
TEN YEARS A TEDIOUS WARFARE RAGED ERE ILIUM'S SMOKING RUINS PAID
BUT WHEN HEAVEN'S ANGER ASKED A LIFE AND BAFFLING WINDS HIS COURSE WITHSTOOD THE KING PUT OFF HIS FATHERHOOD AND SLEW HIS CHILD WITH PRIESTLY KNIFE WHEN BY THE CAVERN'S GLIMMERING LIGHT HIS COMRADES DEAR ODYSSEUS SAW IN THE HUGE CYCLOPS HIDEOUS MAW
BY NO MEANS THEN CAN GOODS WHICH ARE SUPREME BE DIFFERENT ONE FROM THE OTHER BUT WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BOTH HAPPINESS AND GOD ARE THE SUPREME GOOD WHEREFORE THAT WHICH IS HIGHEST DIVINITY
ALTHOUGH I NOW ANTICIPATE WHAT THOU INTENDEST I HAVE A DESIRE TO HEAR THE ARGUMENT PLAINLY SET FORTH AWHILE AGO THOU DEEMEDST IT BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT GOD DOTH GOVERN THE WORLD
EVEN THINGS WHICH BY NATURE ARE NOT GOOD ARE DESIRED AS IF THEY WERE TRULY GOOD IF THEY SEEM TO BE SO
AGAIN ON HOW SLIGHT AND PERISHABLE A POSSESSION DO THEY RELY WHO SET BEFORE THEMSELVES BODILY EXCELLENCES CAN YE EVER SURPASS THE ELEPHANT IN BULK OR THE BULL IN STRENGTH
LIVES LIKE A DULL ASS HE WHO IS LIGHT AND INCONSTANT NEVER HOLDING LONG TO ONE THING IS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A BIRD HE WHO WALLOWS IN FOUL AND UNCLEAN LUSTS IS SUNK IN THE PLEASURES OF A FILTHY HOG
WILL RESTRAINS THAT WORK OF REPRODUCTION BY WHICH ALONE THE PERSISTENCE OF PERISHABLE CREATURES IS MAINTAINED SO ENTIRELY DOES THIS LOVE OF SELF COME FROM DRIFT OF NATURE NOT FROM ANIMAL IMPULSE
IT WOULD BE UTTERLY IMPOTENT THERE IS NOTHING THEN WHICH HAS EITHER THE WILL OR THE POWER TO OPPOSE THIS SUPREME GOOD NO I THINK NOT SO THEN
IF THEY WERE BUT WILLING TO WEIGH THEIR OWN CASE COULD THEY THINK THEMSELVES FREE FROM PUNISHMENT WHOM WICKEDNESS WORST OF ALL EVILS HAS NOT ONLY TOUCHED BUT DEEPLY TAINTED
THE FATAL GOBLET DRAINED ALL NOW WITH LOW BENT HEAD LIKE SWINE ON ACORNS FED MAN'S SPEECH AND FORM WERE REFT NO HUMAN FEATURE LEFT BUT STEADFAST STILL
THE GREAT BOAR'S DRIBBLED SPUME DID STAIN LAST TOIL OF ALL HIS MIGHT SUSTAINED THE BALL OF HEAVEN NOR DID HE BEND BENEATH THIS TOIL HIS LABOUR'S END THE PRIZE OF HEAVEN'S HIGH GLORY GAINED BRAVE HEARTS PRESS ON LO HEAVENWARD LEAD
GENERATION AFTER GENERATION FOR EVER AND DO NOT ALSO THE THINGS BELIEVED INANIMATE ON LIKE GROUNDS OF REASON SEEK EACH WHAT IS PROPER TO ITSELF WHY DO THE FLAMES SHOOT LIGHTLY UPWARD
SO IT COMES TO PASS THAT HE WHO BY FORSAKING RIGHTEOUSNESS CEASES TO BE A MAN CANNOT PASS INTO A GODLIKE CONDITION BUT ACTUALLY TURNS INTO A BRUTE BEAST SONG THREE
OF MUTUAL COLLISION IT MAY BE FROM THE IMPACT SOME FAIR SPARK OF TRUTH MAY BE STRUCK OUT IF IT BE THY GOOD PLEASURE SAID I NO ONE CAN DOUBT THAT GOD IS ALL POWERFUL
OF ITS MEMBERS PRESENTS A HUMAN APPEARANCE BUT IF THE SEPARATION AND DISPERSAL OF THE PARTS BREAK UP THE BODY'S UNITY IT CEASES TO BE WHAT IT WAS AND IF WE EXTEND OUR SURVEY TO ALL OTHER THINGS WITHOUT DOUBT IT WILL MANIFESTLY APPEAR
WE JUDGE HAPPINESS TO BE GOOD DO WE NOT YEA THE SUPREME GOOD AND THIS SUPERLATIVE APPLIES TO ALL FOR THIS SAME HAPPINESS IS ADJUDGED TO BE THE COMPLETEST INDEPENDENCE
ALL MAY WIN ELSE HOW COULD YE THE ANSWER DUE
THE EYE OF INTELLIGENCE IS YET MORE EXALTED
SHE CEASED AND WAS ABOUT TO PASS ON IN HER DISCOURSE TO THE EXPOSITION OF OTHER MATTERS WHEN I BREAK IN AND SAY EXCELLENT IS THINE EXHORTATION AND SUCH AS WELL BESEEMETH THY HIGH AUTHORITY
THAT WE SHOULD ASSERT THAT THE BAD WHO FORM THE GREATER PART OF MANKIND DO NOT EXIST BUT THE FACT IS SO I DO NOT INDEED DENY THAT THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE BAD BUT THAT THEY ARE IN AN UNQUALIFIED AND ABSOLUTE SENSE I DENY
ON THE SMOOTH UNSULLIED WHITE OF THE PAPER'S FACE SO DO OUTER THINGS IMPRESS IMAGES ON CONSCIOUSNESS BUT IF VERILY THE MIND THUS ALL PASSIVE LIES IF NO LIVING POWER WITHIN ITS OWN FORCE SUPPLIES
FOR SINCE GOOD AND EVIL ARE CONTRARIES IF IT IS MADE PLAIN THAT GOOD IS POWER THE FEEBLENESS OF EVIL IS CLEARLY SEEN AND CONVERSELY IF THE FRAIL NATURE OF EVIL IS MADE MANIFEST THE STRENGTH OF GOOD IS THEREBY KNOWN
NOR CAN IMAGINATION BEHOLD UNIVERSAL IDEAS NOR THOUGHT EMBRACE PURE FORM BUT INTELLIGENCE LOOKING DOWN AS IT WERE FROM ITS HIGHER STANDPOINT IN ITS INTUITION OF FORM DISCRIMINATES ALSO THE SEVERAL ELEMENTS WHICH UNDERLIE IT
AND IF YOU TRY TO TRANSPLANT THESE ELSEWHERE THEY WITHER AWAY NATURE GIVES TO EACH THE SOIL THAT SUITS IT AND USES HER DILIGENCE TO PREVENT ANY OF THEM DYING SO LONG AS IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CONTINUE ALIVE
WERE THERE NOT ONE WHO KEEPS TOGETHER WHAT HE HAS JOINED NOR WOULD THE ORDER OF NATURE PROCEED SO REGULARLY NOR COULD ITS COURSE EXHIBIT MOTIONS SO FIXED IN RESPECT OF POSITION TIME RANGE EFFICACY
AS THOU WERT READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE JUST NOW THE FACT OF FOREKNOWLEDGE IMPOSES NO NECESSITY ON THINGS FUTURE WHAT REASON IS THERE FOR SUPPOSING THE RESULTS OF VOLUNTARY ACTION CONSTRAINED TO A FIXED ISSUE SUPPOSE FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT
CAN LOVERS MOVE A HIGHER LAW IS LOVE FOR ORPHEUS WOE IS ME
AND THINKS FAME AND RANK ALIKE WORTHLESS WITHOUT POWER BUT THOU SEEST IN HOW MANY WAYS HIS STATE ALSO IS DEFECTIVE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS THAT HE LACKS NECESSARIES
ENGULFED HE WEPT THE PITEOUS SIGHT BUT BLINDED SOON AND WILD WITH PAIN IN BITTER TEARS AND SORE ANNOY FOR THAT FOUL FEAST'S UNHOLY JOY GRIM POLYPHEMUS PAID AGAIN HIS LABOURS FOR ALCIDES WIN A NAME OF GLORY FAR AND WIDE
WE MUST INVOKE THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS SAID I FOR WITHOUT THIS NO ENTERPRISE SETS OUT FROM A RIGHT BEGINNING
THAN THE FACULTY OF THE THINGS WHICH THEY COGNIZE NOR IS THIS STRANGE FOR SINCE EVERY JUDGMENT IS THE ACT OF THE JUDGE IT IS NECESSARY THAT EACH SHOULD ACCOMPLISH ITS TASK BY ITS OWN NOT BY ANOTHER'S POWER
CORRESPONDING TO ALL THAT WE SEE ACCRUE AS REWARD OF THE GOOD THERE IS SOME PENALTY ATTACHED AS PUNISHMENT OF EVIL AS THEN RIGHTEOUSNESS ITSELF IS THE REWARD OF THE RIGHTEOUS
HEARTILY DO I AGREE AND INDEED I ANTICIPATED WHAT THOU WOULDST SAY THOUGH IT MAY BE IN FEEBLE SURMISE ONLY I WELL BELIEVE IT SAID SHE FOR AS I THINK
EX NIHILO FOR IT HAS ITS PROPER CAUSES THE UNFORESEEN AND UNEXPECTED CONCURRENCE OF WHICH HAS BROUGHT THE CHANCE ABOUT FOR HAD NOT THE CULTIVATOR BEEN DIGGING
THIS IS WE SAY A LIVING CREATURE BUT WHEN THIS UNITY IS BROKEN BY THE SEPARATION OF THESE TWO THE CREATURE DIES AND IS CLEARLY NO LONGER LIVING
WITH WHAT SPLENDOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS SHINES WHEREBY IT IS MANIFEST THAT GOODNESS NEVER LACKS ITS REWARD NOR CRIME ITS PUNISHMENT FOR VERILY IN ALL MANNER OF TRANSACTIONS
WHILE THE BAD ARE LEFT WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH
OR TRIAL OF THE GOOD AND THE PUNISHING OR AMENDING OF THE BAD EVERY FORTUNE MUST BE GOOD SINCE IT IS EITHER JUST OR USEFUL THE REASONING IS EXCEEDING TRUE SAID I THE CONCLUSION SO LONG AS I REFLECT UPON THE PROVIDENCE AND FATE OF WHICH THOU HAST TAUGHT ME
BUT WE HAVE PROVED THAT ONE IS THE VERY SAME THING AS GOOD WE HAVE ALL THINGS THEN SEEK THE GOOD INDEED YOU MAY EXPRESS THE FACT BY DEFINING GOOD AS THAT WHICH ALL DESIRE
THE DAUGHTER OF THE SUN
EMBRACES IMAGES AND SENSE IMPRESSIONS WITHOUT RESORTING TO IMAGINATION OR SENSE
WHERE FISH AND PRICKLY URCHINS DO ABOUND ALL THIS THEY KNOW FULL WELL BUT NOT TO KNOW OR CARE WHERE HIDDEN LIES THE GOOD ALL HEARTS DESIRE THIS BLINDNESS THEY CAN BEAR
FOR INSTANCE IF A MAN IS DIGGING THE EARTH FOR TILLAGE AND FINDS A MASS OF BURIED GOLD NOW SUCH A FIND IS REGARDED AS ACCIDENTAL YET IT IS NOT
AND SHINE IN THINE OWN SPLENDOUR
THESE NEITHER LEAD AS BY WAYS TO HAPPINESS NOR THEMSELVES MAKE MEN COMPLETELY HAPPY
IN HIS OWN BOSOM RAGED THE MUSIC THAT COULD CALM ALL ELSE BROUGHT HIM NO BALM CHIDING THE POWERS IMMORTAL HE CAME UNTO HELL'S PORTAL
LACK MANY GOOD THINGS IS NOT THE HAPPINESS MEN SEEK IN THEM CLEARLY DISCOVERED TO BE A FALSE SHOW THEREFORE DO I FIRST ASK THEE THYSELF WHO BUT LATELY WERT LIVING IN AFFLUENCE AMID ALL THAT ABUNDANCE OF WEALTH
OF COURSE NOT THEN IN RESPECT OF WHAT HE CAN ACCOMPLISH A MAN IS TO BE RECKONED STRONG IN RESPECT OF WHAT HE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WEAK GRANTED SAID I THEN DOST THOU REMEMBER THAT BY OUR FORMER REASONINGS
AND SO COMES TO APPEAR SOMEWHAT POOR IN ESTEEM I CANNOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEING WHAT IT IS THIS UNION OF QUALITIES IS ALSO RIGHT FAMOUS IT FOLLOWS THEN
HOWEVER TO WIN AMPLER CREDENCE FOR MY CONCLUSION I WILL PURSUE BOTH PATHS AND DRAW CONFIRMATION FOR MY STATEMENTS FIRST IN ONE WAY AND THEN IN THE OTHER THE CARRYING OUT OF ANY HUMAN ACTION DEPENDS UPON TWO THINGS
THAT WE MUST ADMIT THAT RENOWN IS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER THREE IT DOES SAID I THAT THEN WHICH NEEDS NOTHING OUTSIDE ITSELF WHICH CAN ACCOMPLISH ALL THINGS IN ITS OWN STRENGTH
IT IS SAID I THIS THEN WHICH IS ONE AND SIMPLE BY NATURE HUMAN PERVERSITY SEPARATES AND IN TRYING TO WIN A PART OF THAT WHICH HAS NO PARTS
DOST THOU THEN SEE THE CONSEQUENCE OF ALL THAT WE HAVE SAID NAY WHAT CONSEQUENCE THAT ABSOLUTELY EVERY FORTUNE IS GOOD FORTUNE AND HOW CAN THAT BE SAID I ATTEND SAID SHE SINCE EVERY FORTUNE WELCOME AND UNWELCOME ALIKE HAS FOR ITS OBJECT THE REWARD
THE OTHER ATTAIN IT NOT IS THERE ANY DOUBT THAT THE GOOD ARE ENDUED WITH POWER WHILE THEY WHO ARE BAD ARE WEAK IF ANY DOUBT IT HE IS INCAPABLE OF REFLECTING ON THE NATURE OF THINGS OR THE CONSEQUENCES INVOLVED IN REASONING
TO HINDER ITS BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM THOSE WHO POSSESS IT AGAINST THEIR WILL I ADMIT IT WHY OF COURSE WHEN EVERY DAY THE STRONGER WRESTS IT FROM THE WEAKER WITHOUT HIS CONSENT ELSE WHENCE COME LAWSUITS
BY THE BLESSING OF GOD WHOM WE LATELY ADDRESSED IN PRAYER
AND THE UNIVERSE CONTROLS
STIRS THE SOUL'S INTELLIGENCE WHEN LIGHT FLASHES ON THE EYE OR SOUND STRIKES THE EAR MIND AROUSED TO DUE RESPONSE MAKES THE MESSAGE CLEAR
FOR WHOSO DRINKS IT UP MUST SUFFER HIDEOUS CHANGE TO MONSTROUS SHAPES AND STRANGE ONE LIKE A BOAR APPEARS THIS HIS HUGE FORM UPREARS MIGHTY IN BULK AND LIMB
ALAS HOW WIDE ASTRAY DOTH IGNORANCE THESE WRETCHED MORTALS LEAD FROM TRUTH'S OWN WAY FOR NOT ON LEAFY STEMS DO YE WITHIN THE GREEN WOOD LOOK FOR GOLD NOR STRIP THE VINE FOR GEMS
THEN ALL THAT ERROR'S MISTS OBSCURED SHALL SHINE MORE CLEAR THAN LIGHT THIS FLESHLY FRAME'S OBLIVIOUS WEIGHT HATH QUENCHED NOT REASON QUITE THE GERMS OF TRUTH STILL LIE WITHIN WHENCE WE BY LEARNING
THEY CANNOT IN ANY WISE BE DISPUTED BUT COME SEE HOW STRICTLY AND INCONTROVERTIBLY THOU MAYST PROVE THIS OUR ASSERTION
IS THE REWARD OFFERED FOR RUNNING NOW WE HAVE SHOWN HAPPINESS TO BE THAT VERY GOOD FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH ALL THINGS ARE DONE ABSOLUTE GOOD THEN
THEIR ESSENCE IS ONE AND THE SAME THERE IS NO DENYING IT NOW DOST THOU KNOW SAID SHE THAT ALL WHICH IS ABIDES AND SUBSISTS SO LONG AS IT CONTINUES ONE BUT SO SOON AS IT CEASES TO BE ONE IT PERISHES
AND DRAW OUR BREATH UNCONSCIOUSLY IN SLEEP NAY EVEN IN LIVING CREATURES THE LOVE OF LIFE COMETH NOT OF CONSCIOUS WILL
SINCE GOD IS RIGHTLY BELIEVED TO GOVERN ALL THINGS WITH THE RUDDER OF GOODNESS AND SINCE ALL THINGS DO LIKEWISE AS I HAVE TAUGHT HASTE TOWARDS GOOD BY THE VERY AIM OF NATURE CAN IT BE DOUBTED THAT HIS GOVERNANCE IS WILLINGLY ACCEPTED
NAY BY NO MEANS SAID I THEN HAPPINESS MUST CERTAINLY NOT BE SOUGHT IN THESE THINGS WHICH SEVERALLY ARE BELIEVED TO AFFORD SOME ONE OF THE BLESSINGS MOST TO BE DESIRED THEY MUST NOT I ADMIT
IT SEEMS SO BUT IF THE BAD WERE TO ATTAIN THE GOOD WHICH IS THEIR OBJECT THEY COULD NOT BE BAD NO
BUT WHICH THEY CANNOT WIN OR HOLD NAY THEIR FAILURE CONCERNS THE VERY SUM AND CROWN OF THINGS POOR WRETCHES THEY FAIL TO COMPASS EVEN THAT FOR WHICH THEY TOIL DAY AND NIGHT
EACH TO ITS STARRY CAR AFFIXING
THAT WHICH CAN TRULY BESTOW ONE OF THEM I KNOW TO BE WITHOUT DOUBT FULL AND COMPLETE HAPPINESS HAPPY ART THOU MY SCHOLAR IN THIS THY CONVICTION ONLY ONE THING SHOULDST THOU ADD
WHEREAS IF THERE IS NO NECESSITY THEY CAN BY NO MEANS BE FOREKNOWN AND THOU THINKEST THAT NOTHING CAN BE GRASPED AS KNOWN UNLESS IT IS CERTAIN BUT IF THINGS WHOSE OCCURRENCE IS UNCERTAIN ARE FOREKNOWN AS CERTAIN
HAD NOT THE MAN WHO HID THE MONEY BURIED IT IN THAT PRECISE SPOT THE GOLD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND THESE THEN ARE THE REASONS WHY THE FIND IS A CHANCE ONE IN THAT IT RESULTS FROM CAUSES WHICH MET TOGETHER AND CONCURRED
AND FALLS TO PIECES IN WHAT WAY WHY TAKE ANIMALS FOR EXAMPLE
BUT DEEP SET WITHIN THY INMOST BEING THE FORM OF PERFECT GOOD FROM ENVY FREE AND THOU DIDST MOULD THE WHOLE TO THAT SUPERNAL PATTERN BEAUTEOUS THE WORLD IN THEE THUS IMAGED
EVER WRANGLING IN LAW COURTS IS LIKE SOME YELPING CUR THE SECRET SCHEMER TAKING PLEASURE IN FRAUD AND STEALTH IS OWN BROTHER TO THE FOX THE PASSIONATE MAN
WHO SO ATTAINS THE END OF HIS DESIRES THAT NOTHING FURTHER TO BE DESIRED LIES BEYOND WHENCE FOLLOWS THE OBVIOUS CONCLUSION THAT THEY WHO ARE WICKED ARE SEEN LIKEWISE TO BE WHOLLY DESTITUTE OF STRENGTH FOR WHY DO THEY FORSAKE VIRTUE AND FOLLOW VICE
BUT SINCE I SEE THEE SO READY AT UNDERSTANDING I WILL HEAP PROOF ON PROOF LOOK HOW MANIFEST IS THE EXTREMITY OF VICIOUS MEN'S WEAKNESS THEY CANNOT EVEN REACH THAT GOAL TO WHICH THE AIM OF NATURE LEADS AND ALMOST CONSTRAINS THEM
BRING WITH THEM ANYTHING OF SUCH SORT AS SEEMS TO HAVE NOTHING WANTING TO IT THAT IS GOOD WE TOO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME ARE MADE HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF THESE THINGS BUT IF THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO FULFIL THEIR PROMISES AND MOREOVER
CANNOT BE IDENTICAL THEREFORE THAT WHICH OF ITS OWN NATURE IS DISTINCT FROM THE HIGHEST GOOD IS NOT ITSELF THE HIGHEST GOOD AN IMPIOUS THOUGHT OF HIM THAN WHOM TIS PLAIN NOTHING CAN BE MORE EXCELLENT
FOR UNIVERSALLY NOTHING CAN BE BETTER IN NATURE THAN THE SOURCE FROM WHICH IT HAS COME THEREFORE ON MOST TRUE GROUNDS OF REASON WOULD I CONCLUDE THAT WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS TO BE
AS THEY APPROACHED THE SHORES OF ENGLAND MARIAN IMPROVED SO FAST AS TO BE ABLE TO GO ON DECK AND THOUGH EXTREMELY PALE AND THIN SHE COULD NO LONGER BE CONSIDERED AN INVALID WHEN ON THE THIRTIETH DAY OUT THEIR SHIP ENTERED THE MOUTH OF THE MERSEY
MOTIONLESS BREATHLESS LIKE SOME WRETCHED SOMNAMBULIST SUDDENLY AWAKENED IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME AND GAZING IN HORROR AMAZEMENT AND UNBELIEF UPON THE WORK OF HIS SLEEP SUDDENLY HE DROPPED UPON HIS KNEES BY HER SIDE
THE CONJECTURES THE INQUIRIES AND PERHAPS THE LEGAL INVESTIGATION THAT MIGHT LEAD TO THE EXPOSURE AND PUNISHMENT OF THURSTON WAS INSUPPORTABLE TO HER HEART NO NO RATHER LET THE WIDTH OF THE OCEAN DIVIDE HER FROM ALL THOSE HORRORS
EVERY BREATH PUMPING OUT THE LIFE BLOOD THAT HAD MADE A LITTLE POOL BESIDE HIS FACE MISSUS WAUGH
THANKING THEIR HOST THEY TOOK LEAVE OF HIM OF HIS OLD WIFE AND MARIAN AND DEPARTED THE OLD MINISTER LOOKED HARD AT MARIAN YOU ARE PALE MY DEAR WELL I ALWAYS HEARD THAT OUR FRESH ISLAND ROSES
HE WAS MY SON MY ONLY ONLY SON MY
BUT THAT HER HEART WAS EXHAUSTED BY ITS ONE GREAT ALL CONSUMING GRIEF IT MUST HAVE BLED FOR THEM YET THEY HAD ALREADY SUFFERED ALL THEY COULD POSSIBLY SUFFER FROM THE SUPPOSITION OF HER DEATH IT WAS NOW THREE WEEKS SINCE THEY HAD REASON TO BELIEVE HER DEAD
BUT THE MYSTERIOUS BOAT WAS SWIFTLY HID IN THE DARKNESS AND OUR BOAT REACHED THE LAND THE MATE AND HIS MAN HAD TO HELP TO CARRY THE PASSENGER'S TRUNKS UP TO THE TOP OF THE BLUFF AND A SHORT DISTANCE BEYOND
AS THEY NEARED THE SHORE THEY MET ANOTHER BOAT ROWED BY TWO MEN WHO SEEMED SO ANXIOUS TO ESCAPE OBSERVATION AS TO ROW AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD WITHOUT ANSWERING OUR BOAT'S SALUTE OUR MATE THOUGHT VERY STRANGE OF IT AT THE TIME
SANG THE ELF SPRINGING AND DANCING AND SPINNING AND WHIRLING
ONE THAT SHE HAD LONGINGLY DREAMED OF BUT NEVER AS NOW HOPED TO REALIZE AND EDITH SHE WOULD MAKE EDITH SO COMFORTABLE EDITH SHOULD BE AGAIN SURROUNDED WITH THE ELEGANCIES AND REFINEMENTS OF LIFE
AND DOUBTLESS KIND NATURE HAD ALREADY NURSED THEM INTO RESIGNATION AND CALMNESS THAT WOULD IN TIME BECOME CHEERFULNESS IF SHE SHOULD GO BACK THERE WOULD BE THE SHOCK THE AMAZEMENT THE QUESTIONS THE PROSECUTIONS PERHAPS THE CONVICTION
AND TUMULTUOUS THOUGHTS WAS SCARCELY CONSCIOUS OF THE GATHERING DARKNESS AND THE LOWERING STORM AS SHE WALKED UP AND DOWN UPON THE BEACH LISTENING AND WAITING SHE WONDERED THAT THURSTON HAD NOT BEEN THERE READY TO RECEIVE HER
THEY PLEAD THEY DO NOT THREATEN GO AND UNBAR THE DOOR OLIVER SAID EDITH RELUCTANTLY AND CAUTIOUSLY THE OLD MAN OBEYED LIGHT ANOTHER CANDLE JENNY THAT IS DYING IN ITS SOCKET IT WILL BE OUT IN A MINUTE
THE STORM WOULD SOON BURST FORTH UPON THE EARTH
I NEVER MEANT IT I AM VERY WRETCHED I WISH I'D NEVER BEEN BORN CRIED JACQUELINA WRINGING HER PALE FINGERS
BUT THIS THOUGHT GAVE HER LITTLE UNEASINESS IT WAS NEARLY LOST AS THE STORM AND DARKNESS ALSO WERE IN THE BRIGHTNESS AND GLADNESS OF HER OWN LOVING GENEROUS EMOTIONS THERE WAS NO ROOM IN HER HEART FOR DOUBT OR TROUBLE
MISS MAYFIELD MY GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE AND WITH AN AWFUL CRY BETWEEN A SHRIEK AND A GROAN THE WRETCHED MAN CAST HIMSELF UPON THE GROUND BY THE SIDE OF THE FALLEN BODY THE STORM WAS BEATING WILDLY
UPON THEIR ARRIVAL AT LIVERPOOL IT HAD BEEN THE INTENTION OF DOCTOR HOLMES AND HIS WIFE TO PROCEED TO LONDON BUT NOW THEY DECIDED TO DELAY A FEW HOURS UNTIL THEY SHOULD SEE MARIAN SAFE IN THE HOUSE OF HER FRIENDS
THE MAN PAUSED FOLDED HIS CLOAK ABOUT HIM DREW UP AND STOOD PERFECTLY STILL WHY DID HE NOT ANSWER HER WHY DID HE NOT SPEAK TO HER WHY DID HE STAND SO MOTIONLESS AND LOOK SO STRANGE
THE LOWER COUNTIES OF MARYLAND WERE LEFT COMPARATIVELY UNPROTECTED OLD MEN WOMEN CHILDREN AND NEGROES WERE ALL THAT REMAINED IN CHARGE OF THE FARMS AND PLANTATIONS
AND MIRIAM MIRIAM SHOULD HAVE EVERY ADVANTAGE OF EDUCATION THAT WEALTH COULD POSSIBLY SECURE FOR HER EITHER IN THIS COUNTRY OR IN EUROPE IF EDITH WOULD SPARE MIRIAM
IT WAS THAT OF THE BRUTAL AND FEROCIOUS THORG THE FREQUENT LEADER OF FORAGING PARTIES THE UNSPARING DESTROYER OF WOMANHOOD INFANCY AND AGE THE JACKAL AND PURVEYOR OF ADMIRAL COCKBURN IF ANYWHERE THERE WAS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN UNPROTECTED
HE WAS SO PLEASED WITH THE BEAUTY GRANDEUR RICHNESS AND PROMISE OF THE PLACE
WHILE THESE THINGS WERE BREWING IN EDITH'S MIND SHE RODE SLOWLY AND MORE SLOWLY UNTIL AT LENGTH HER PONY STOPPED THEN SHE NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE HEAVY DOWNCAST LOOKS OF HER ATTENDANTS WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED
AND FINALLY WAS PERMITTED TO RETIRE WITH A BULLET LODGED UNDER HIS SHOULDER BLADE A PIECE OF SILVER TREPANNED IN THE TOP OF HIS SKULL A DEEP SWORD CUT ACROSS HIS FACE FROM THE RIGHT TEMPLE OVER HIS NOSE TO THE LEFT CHEEK AND WITH THE HONORARY TITLE OF COMMODORE
AND THE LONGER DOCTOR GRIMSHAW REMAINED AWAY THE MORE EXCITED SHE GREW SHE SKIPPED ABOUT LIKE THE VERY SPRITE OF MISCHIEF
THEY NATURALLY CONCLUDED THAT YOU HAD BEEN THE VICTIM OF THE MEN IN THE BOAT WHO WERE PROBABLY PIRATES THEIR FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO PURSUE THE CARRIAGE AND GET YOU PLACED WITHIN IT AND TAKEN TO SOME FARMHOUSE FOR ASSISTANCE BUT A MOMENT'S REFLECTION CONVINCED THEM
AND HER ILL HEALTH REMAINED CHARGED TO THE ACCOUNT OF OUR UNLUCKY ATMOSPHERE THE NEXT MORNING THE OLD GENTLEMAN TOOK MARIAN INTO HIS LIBRARY TOLD HER ONCE MORE HOW VERY LITTLE SURPRISED AND HOW VERY GLAD HE WAS THAT INSTEAD OF WRITING SHE HAD COME IN PERSON
AND CARRIED MARIAN AND RACHEL OUT TO THE PLACE THE HOUSE WAS NEARLY OVERGROWN WITH CLIMBING VINES AND THE GROUNDS WERE BEAUTIFUL WITH THE EARLY SPRING VERDURE AND FLOWERS THE OLD MAN WAS OVERJOYED TO MEET MARIAN AND HE RECEIVED HER WITH A FATHER'S WELCOME
SAILED FOR LIVERPOOL MARIAN SLOWLY IMPROVED HER PURPOSES WERE NOT VERY CLEAR OR STRONG YET MENTAL AND PHYSICAL SUFFERING AND EXHAUSTION HAD TEMPORARILY WEAKENED AND OBSCURED HER MIND
THE LADY NURSE TOLD THE FOLLOWING STORY ON THE EVENING OF HOLY THURSDAY ABOUT THE TIME THE STORM AROSE OUR VESSEL LAY TO OPPOSITE A PLACE ON SAINT MARY'S COAST CALLED PINE BLUFF AND THE MATE PUT OFF IN A BOAT TO LAND A PASSENGER
THE COMMODORE DREW NEAR HALF STUPEFIED AS HE ALWAYS WAS IN A CRISIS WHAT WHAT WHAT'S ALL THIS WHO DID IT HOW DID IT HAPPEN HE ASKED WITH A LOOK OF DULL AMAZEMENT
THEY COULD DEVISE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO PUT YOU IN THE BOAT AND BRING YOU ON BOARD THIS VESSEL THAT IS THE WAY YOU CAME HERE THE GRATEFUL GAZE OF MARIAN THANKED THE LADY AND SHE ASKED
LAY UNDEVELOPED A LATENT POWER OF HEROISM SOON TO BE AROUSED INTO ACTION DARLING OF ALL HEARTS AND EYES EDITH HAD BEEN AT HOME A YEAR
AS SHE PRESSED TOWARD HIM BUT HE SUDDENLY STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO REPULSE HER GASPING AS IT WERE BREATHLESSLY NOT YET NOT YET AND AGAIN HIS WHOLE FRAME SHOOK WITH AN INWARD STORM
THAT DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY HAD THAWED WAS FREEZING HARD YET MARIAN HURRIED FEARLESSLY AND GAYLY ON OVER THE RUGGED AND SLIPPERY STUBBLE FIELDS THAT LAY BETWEEN THE COTTAGE AND THE BEACH A RAPID WALK OF FIFTEEN MINUTES
AND THEN HER SCREAMS OF TERROR FILLED THE HOUSE THE FAMILY CAME RUSHING IN FOREMOST ENTERED THE COMMODORE SHAKING HIS STICK IN A TOWERING PASSION AND EXCLAIMING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE WHAT THE DEVIL IS ALL THIS WHAT'S BROKE LOOSE NOW
WHAT IS THE MATTER WHAT AILS GRIM HE HAS RUPTURED AN ARTERY SAID MISSUS WAUGH GRAVELY AS SHE LAID THE SUFFERER GENTLY BACK UPON THE CARPET AND PLACED THE SOFA PILLOW UNDER HIS HEAD
FULL OF THIS THOUGHT SHE WAS AGAIN PRESSING TOWARD HIM WHEN A VIOLENT FLURRY OF RAIN AND WIND WHISTLED BEFORE HER AND DROVE INTO HER FACE CONCEALING HIM FROM HER VIEW WHEN THE SUDDEN GUST AS SUDDENLY PASSED
THURSTON DEAR THURSTON
AND SO IN RECOLLECTING MEDITATING PLANNING AND TRYING TO REASON CORRECTLY AND TO UNDERSTAND HER EMBARRASSED POSITION AND HER DIFFICULT DUTY PASSED THE DAYS OF HER CONVALESCENCE AS HER MIND CLEARED
HE ESCAPED TO SPANISH AMERICA WHERE HE LED FOR YEARS A SORT OF BUCCANEER LIFE
SAID THE OLD MAN WAKING UP TO ANXIETY STAY THE DOCTOR HAS BEEN SENT FOR BUT HE MUST NOT BE MOVED IT WOULD BE FATAL TO HIM INDEED I FEAR THAT HE IS BEYOND HUMAN HELP SAID HENRIETTA AS SHE WIPED THE GUSHING STREAM FROM THE LIPS OF THE DYING MAN
THAT SUCH A PLAN WAS FUTILE AS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERTAKE THE CARRIAGE THERE WAS ALSO NO HOUSE NEAR THE COAST THEY THOUGHT IT LIKELY THAT YOU WERE A STRANGER TO THAT PART OF THE COUNTRY AND IN THE HURRY AND AGITATION OF THE MOMENT
HE THEN MADE HER ACQUAINTED WITH CERTAIN DOCUMENTS AND INFORMED HER THAT IT WOULD BE NECESSARY SHE SHOULD GO UP TO LONDON AND ADVISED HER TO DO SO JUST AS SOON AS SHE SHOULD FEEL HERSELF SUFFICIENTLY RESTED
FOR SHE HAD CONFIDENTLY TRUSTED IN HIS KEEPING HIS APPOINTMENT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN HIM TO FAIL BEFORE WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE FAILURE NOW HAD HE KEPT HIS TRYSTE THEY WOULD NOW HAVE BEEN SAFELY HOUSED AT OLD FIELD COTTAGE
OPEN OPEN LET US IN FOR GOD'S SAKE LET US IN
AND HE REMAINED STILL SMILING AS IN DELIGHTED VISIONS UNTIL ONE OF HIS FRIENDS SPOKE AND SAID WELL COMRADE IS THIS LUCK ENOUGH YAW MINE FRIENT
OR AS HIS ENERGETIC COMPLAINTS OF ILL LUCK COULD MAKE THEM HE HAD DRAWN HIS SWORD IN ALMOST EVERY QUARREL OF HIS TIME ON EVERY BATTLEFIELD IN EUROPE TO FIND HIMSELF AT THE END OF HIS MILITARY CAREER NO RICHER THAN HE WAS AT ITS BEGINNING
THURSTON UPON THE BARE POSSIBILITY OF HER PRESENCE THERE WOULD KEEP HIS APPOINTMENT NO SOMETHING BEYOND HIS CONTROL HAD DELAYED HIM AND UNLESS HE SHOULD NOW VERY SOON APPEAR SOMETHING VERY SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
THOUGH TENDED CHIEFLY BY WOMEN AND BOYS
COMMODORE AND MISSUS WAUGH ENTERED THE FAMILY CARRIAGE WHICH THEY PRETTY WELL FILLED UP MISSUS WAUGH'S WOMAN SAT UPON THE BOX BEHIND AND THE COMMODORE'S MAN DROVE THE COACH AND THE WHOLE FAMILY PARTY SET FORWARD ON THEIR JOURNEY
IN WHICH MARIAN SOUGHT AT ONCE TO FORGET HER OWN EXISTENCE AND TO BLESS THAT OF OTHERS A FEW EVENTS ONLY IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO RECORD IN THE VERY FIRST PACKET OF BALTIMORE PAPERS RECEIVED BY DOCTOR HOLMES
HER ONE STRONG IMPULSE WAS TO ESCAPE TO GET AWAY FROM THE SCENES OF SUCH PAINFUL ASSOCIATIONS AND MEMORIES AND TO GO HOME TO TAKE REFUGE IN HER OWN NATIVE LAND THE THOUGHT OF RETURNING TO MARYLAND TO MEET THE ASTONISHMENT THE WONDER
SOBBED JENNY NOW COMPLETELY BROKEN DOWN BY HER TERRORS
CHAPTER ONE LUCKENOUGH
OH HENRIETTA IS HE DEAD
OF HER PRESENCE IN TOWN ONLY A FEW HOURS HAD ELAPSED AFTER READING HER NOTE AND ADDRESS BEFORE SHE RECEIVED A CALL FROM MISSUS HOLMES AND HER FATHER DOCTOR COLEMAN A CLERGYMAN OF HIGH STANDING IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND FRIENDLINESS AND A BEAUTIFUL SIMPLICITY
OH MISS EDITH DON'T ASK ME HONEY DON'T AIN'T WE DEM GOT TO GO BACK TO DE HOUSE AND STAY DAR BY OUR TWO SELVES ARTER WE SEE YOU SAFE SAID JENNY CRYING NO WHAT YOU TWO ALONE
GAZING AT THE RUIN THE OLD MAN'S GLANCE FELL UPON HER THERE AND HIS PASSION CHANGED FROM GRIEF TO FURY FIERCELY HE BROKE FORTH IT WAS YOU YOU ARE THE MURDERESS YOU
COULD THESE CONSEQUENCES CONSOLE OR BENEFIT EDITH OR MIRIAM NO NO THEY WOULD AUGMENT GRIEF IT WAS BETTER TO LEAVE THINGS AS THEY WERE BETTER TO REMAIN DEAD TO THEM A DEAD SORROW MIGHT BE FORGOTTEN LIVING ONE NEVER
CHARACTERIZED THE MANNERS OF BOTH FATHER AND DAUGHTER RACHEL ENTREATED MARIAN TO RETURN WITH HER AND MAKE HER FATHER'S HOUSE HER HOME WHILE IN LONDON SHE SPOKE WITH AN AFFECTIONATE SINCERITY THAT MARIAN COULD NEITHER DOUBT NOR RESIST
IF I MEET THE ENEMY AND SAVE THE HOUSE THEY WILL SAY THAT EDITH LANCE IS A HEROINE
HER HAPPINESS HAD SEEMED A DREAM WITHOUT THAT PROOF OF ITS REALITY FOR ONCE SHE GAVE WAY TO IMAGINATION AND ALLOWED THAT MAGICIAN TO BUILD CASTLES IN THE AIR AT WILL
UNTIL THE BREAKING OUT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR WHEN HE TOOK SERVICE WITH PAUL JONES THE AMERICAN SEA KING
MARSHALING CATTLE AND MAKING OTHER PREPARATIONS FOR A RAPID RETREAT TOWARD COMMODORE WAUGH'S PATRIMONIAL ESTATE IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY EDITH WAS PLACED UPON HER PONY AND ATTENDED BY HER OLD MAID JENNY AND HER OLD GROOM OLIVER
THIS PLEASANT ROAD RAN ALONG THE SIDE OF A PURLING BROOK UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT TREES THAT SKIRTED THE FOREST
AND WHEN AT THE CALL OF SOCIAL DUTY SHE DID GO INTO COMPANY SHE EXERCISED A REFINING AND SUBDUING INFLUENCE INVOLUNTARY AS IT WAS POTENT YET IN THAT LOVELY FRAGILE FORM IN THAT DREAMING POETICAL SOUL
MARIAN FEEBLY PRESSED HER HAND AND THEN SAID YOU ARE VERY GOOD TO ASK ME NO QUESTIONS AND I THANK YOU WITH ALL MY HEART FOR DEAR LADY I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING THE NEXT DAY THE VESSEL WHICH HAD PUT INTO NEW YORK HARBOR ON CALL
SET OUT FOR THE MAMMOTH CAPITAL WHERE IN DUE SEASON THEY ARRIVED A FEW DAYS WERE BUSILY OCCUPIED AMID THE LUMBER OF LAW DOCUMENTS BEFORE MARIAN FELT SUFFICIENTLY AT EASE TO ADVISE HER FRIENDS
MARIAN DECLARED HERSELF TO BE ALREADY RECOVERED OF FATIGUE AND ANXIOUS TO PROCEED WITH THE BUSINESS OF SETTLEMENT THEIR JOURNEY WAS THEREUPON FIXED FOR THE SECOND DAY FROM THAT TIME AND UPON THE APPOINTED MORNING MARIAN ATTENDED BY THE OLD CLERGYMAN
THE ELF DANCED ABOUT THE ROOM
AND WRAPPED HER SHAWL TIGHTLY ABOUT HER AS SHE MET THE BLAST OH WHERE WAS THURSTON AND WHY DID HE NOT COME SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR HAVING VENTURED OUT YET COULD SHE HAVE FORESEEN THIS NO
GIVE ME A SOFA CUSHION MARIA TO PLACE UNDER HIS HEAD MARY L'OISEAU HURRY AS FAST AS YOU CAN AND SEND A BOY FOR DOCTOR BRIGHTWELL TELL HIM TO TAKE THE SWIFTEST HORSE IN THE STABLE AND RIDE FOR LIFE AND DEATH AND BRING THE PHYSICIAN INSTANTLY FOR DOCTOR GRIMSHAW IS DYING HURRY
AND HIDING AS IN TERROR THE TIDE WAS COMING IN AND THE WAVES SURGED HEAVILY WITH A DEEP MOAN UPON THE BEACH NOT A SOUND WAS HEARD EXCEPT THE DULL MONOTONOUS MOAN OF THE SEA AND THE FITFUL
IS HE QUITE GONE HE IS GONE COMMODORE WAUGH LAY HIM DOWN COME AWAY TO YOUR ROOM SAID HENRIETTA GENTLY TAKING HIS HAND JACQUELINA WHITE WITH HORROR WAS KNEELING WITH CLASPED HANDS AND DILATED EYES
WHAT COULD BE THE REASON OF HIS STRANGE BEHAVIOR OH SOME MISFORTUNE HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THAT WAS EVIDENT WOULD IT WERE ONLY OF A NATURE THAT HER OWN GOOD NEWS MIGHT BE ABLE TO CURE AND IT MIGHT BE SO
STANDS THE ANCIENT MANOR HOUSE OF LUCKENOUGH THE TRADITIONS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSERT THE ORIGIN OF THE MANOR AND ITS QUAINT HAPPY AND NOT UNMUSICAL NAME TO HAVE BEEN BRIEFLY THIS
THIRDLY THAT THE GRATEFUL AND HAPPY SOLDIER HAD ONLY MEANT TO EXPRESS HIS PERFECT SATISFACTION WITH HIS FORTUNE AND TO SAY YES THIS IS LUCK ENOUGH LUCK ENOUGH TO REPAY ME FOR ALL THE PAST
SOME MEANS ALSO SHOULD BE FOUND WHEN SHE SHOULD GROW STRONGER AND HER POOR HEAD SHOULD BE CLEARER SO THAT SHE SHOULD BE ABLE TO THINK TO MAKE EDITH AND MIRIAM THE RECIPIENTS OF ALL THE BENEFIT HER WEALTH COULD POSSIBLY CONFER UPON THEM
AND THEN FOLLOWED YEARS OF MILITARY SERVICE WHEREVER HIS HIRELING SWORD WAS NEEDED BUT THE SOLDIER OF FORTUNE WAS ILL PAID BY HIS MISTRESS HIS MISFORTUNES WERE AS PROVERBIAL AS HIS BRAVERY
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR NIGHT AND STORM THE HEAVENS WERE GROWING VERY DARK THE WIND WAS RISING AND DRIVING BLACK CLOUDS ATHWART THE SKY THE ATMOSPHERE WAS BECOMING PIERCINGLY COLD THE SNOW
SHE TOOK OFF HER BONNET AND MANTLE AND LAID THEM ASIDE AND BEGAN TO SMOOTH HER HAIR DANCING ALL THE TIME AND QUIVERING WITH SUPPRESSED LAUGHTER IN ANTICIPATION OF HER FUN WHEN SHE HAD ARRANGED HER DRESS SHE WENT DOWN STAIRS AND PASSED INTO THE DINING ROOM
ME THINKS I HEAR THE DIN OF BATTLE OH
CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT IN MERRY ENGLAND WHEN MARIAN RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS SHE FOUND HERSELF ON BOARD SHIP AND A LADY ATTENDING TO HER WANTS WHEN SHE WAS AT LAST ABLE TO ASK HOW SHE CAME THERE
AND THE SAME DAY MISTER BURNEY BADE A TEMPORARY FAREWELL TO HIS FAVORITE AND DEPARTED FOR LIVERPOOL AND MARIAN ACCOMPANIED HER FRIEND RACHEL HOLMES TO THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR COLEMAN WE MAY NOT PAUSE TO TRACE MINUTELY THE LABORS OF LOVE
THURSTON AND HERSELF MUST GO TO ENGLAND IMMEDIATELY TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE ESTATE THAT WAS CERTAIN THEN THEY MUST RETURN BUT ERE THAT SHE WOULD CONFIDE TO HIM HER DARLING PROJECT ONE
AMID THE MOANING AND THE WAILING OF WINDS AND WAVES AND THE GROANING OF THE COMING STORM WAS HEARD THE REGULAR FALL OF OARS SOON FOLLOWED BY THE SLOW GRATING SOUND OF A BOAT
PRESENTLY OH SHAN'T WE THOUGH THE GRIM MANIAC HE HAS GONE TO DETECT ME AND HE'LL BREAK IN UPON THURSTON AND MARIAN'S INTERVIEW WON'T THERE BE AN EXPLOSION
AND AFTER AN ABSENCE OF A FEW MINUTES RETURNED WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS NOT THERE JACQUELINA SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AND SHOOK WITH INWARD LAUGHTER THEY ALL SAT DOWN
IN THAT YEAR HE SUCCEEDED TO THE PRESIDENCY HIMSELF BY AN ELECTORAL VOTE OF ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE OUT OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN AS THE CANDIDATE OF THE PARTY NOW GENERALLY KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC
PLACING A RICH TONED ORGAN IN IT WHICH ALONE COST THREE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS EVERY HONEST TRADESMAN CAN COME TO PULLMAN NONE BUT LIQUOR DEALERS OR MEN WHO DESIRE TO KEEP LOW GROGGERIES ARE EXCLUDED
EDWIN M STANTON EDWIN M STANTON WHOM PRESIDENT LINCOLN SELECTED FOR HIS SECRETARY OF WAR NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT HE HAD SERVED IN THE CABINET OF BUCHANAN WAS BORN AT STEUBENVILLE OHIO DECEMBER NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN
HE EARLY EVINCED A FONDNESS FOR POLITICS WHICH FIRST REVEALED ITSELF IN AN ESSAY ON THE POLITICAL ASPECT DISPLAYING ABILITY FAR BEYOND ONE OF HIS YEARS
IT WAS A SPECIES OF CRAFT WHICH AT ITS WORST WAS ABOVE MERE PETTIFOGGING AND AT ITS BEST WAS UNQUESTIONABLY A HIGH TYPE OF DIPLOMACY THOSE MISTAKE WHO CONSIDERED HIM ONLY AS A CUNNING MAN A PERSON OPPOSED TO HIM IN POLITICS
PULLMAN THE SUBJECT OF THIS SKETCH WE CONSIDER ONE OF THE GREATEST OF PHILANTHROPISTS HE IS A MODEST MAN AND FOR THIS REASON DISCLAIMED ALL DESIRE TO BE KNOWN AS A BENEFACTOR
AS AIDE DE CAMP TO LORD STERLING WITH THE RANK OF MAJOR HE SERVED IN THE CAMPAIGN OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF IN THE BATTLES OF BRANDYWINE GERMANTOWN AND MONMOUTH LEAVING THE ARMY HE RETURNED TO VIRGINIA
WILL TOWER WITH A NOBLE GRANDEUR AS UNDIMMED AND ENVIABLE A SPLENDOR AS THAT OF ANY IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLIC WHICH LIKE HIS FRIEND AND CO WORKER THE GREAT LINCOLN
AND SOON AFTER WAS COMMISSIONED A LIEUTENANT HE TOOK AN ACTIVE PART IN THE CAMPAIGN ON THE HUDSON AND IN THE ATTACK ON TRENTON AT THE HEAD OF A SMALL DETACHMENT HE CAPTURED ONE OF THE BRITISH BATTERIES ON THIS OCCASION HE RECEIVED A BALL IN THE SHOULDER
OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED BEAUTIFUL HOMES WERE BUILT BEFORE ANY MAN WAS ASKED TO COME TO PULLMAN TO ENTER THE SHOPS A BANK WAS OPENED A LIBRARY CONTAINING THOUSANDS OF VOLUMES WAS PROVIDED ALL THESE THINGS WERE BROUGHT ABOUT BY MISTER PULLMAN
AT THE DEATH OF PRESIDENT TAYLOR MISTER FILLMORE ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION IN SUCH CASES BECAME
REVIEWED MILITARY COMPANIES CORRECTED PUBLIC ABUSES AND STUDIED THE CAPABILITIES OF THE COUNTRY WITH REFERENCE TO FUTURE HOSTILITIES ON THIS TOUR HE WORE THE UNDRESS UNIFORM OF A CONTINENTAL OFFICER IN EVERY POINT OF VIEW THIS JOURNEY WAS A SUCCESS
AND WAS ADMITTED TO THE BAR IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX WHEN IN HIS TWENTY FIRST YEAR WHILE YET A YOUNG LAWYER HE WAS MADE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY OF HARRISON COUNTY
FOR HIS SERVICE IN BREAKING UP THE TWEED RING AND FOR HIS CAREER AS GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APART FROM PURELY PARTY ASPECTS HE IS ENTITLED TO THE THANKS OF THE PEOPLE HIS OWN PARTY WILL SAY TO THE END OF TIME
THESE HE FITTED UP WITH BUNKS AND WHILE THEY WERE NOT TO BE COMPARED WITH THE ELEGANT PALACES WHICH HE HAS SINCE CONSTRUCTED STILL ONE COULD LIE DOWN AND SLEEP ALL NIGHT WHICH WAS SO FAR IN ADVANCE OF ANYTHING THE PEOPLE HAD SEEN
WHERE HE WAS ORIGINALLY BURIED BUT IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY HE WAS REMOVED TO RICHMOND WITH GREAT POMP AND RE INTERRED IN HOLLEYWOOD CEMETERY
UNTIL HE HAD REACHED THE STATE OF MIND IN WHICH HE SAID TO THE PUBLIC WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT HE HAD GONE FURTHER HE HAD APPLIED IT TO THE LEADING MEN OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THE TIME CAME WHEN HE SAT IN HIS GORGEOUSLY FURNISHED APARTMENT IN ALBANY AS CHAIRMAN OF A CERTAIN COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE
AS WELL AS THAT IN PITTSBURGH IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN HIS BUSINESS HAD SO EXPANDED THAT HE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MOVE TO WASHINGTON D C THE SEAT OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
THAN SAMUEL J TILDEN AT THAT TIME IT IS REMARKABLE THAT A MAN SO SILENT AND MYSTERIOUS NOT TO SAY REPELLENT IN HIS INTERCOURSE WITH HIS FELLOW MEN COULD EXERT SUCH A MIGHTY INFLUENCE AS HE UNQUESTIONABLY DID HE DID IT BY CONTROLLING MASTER MINDS
ALL OBSTACLES THUS FAR WILL WE THEN BE SURPRISED WHEN WE READ THAT NO SOONER DID HE ARRIVE IN BUFFALO THAN HE SUCCEEDED
THEY WOULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU ARE TO BE A MILTON A CROMWELL A WEBSTER OR A CLAY THAT YOU CANNOT HELP IT DO WHAT YOU WILL POSSIBLY THIS MAY BE SO IT MAY NOT BE THOUGHT PROPER FOR ME TO DISPUTE THEIR LORDSHIP
AND WHOSE POLITICAL FAITH WAS THE SAME THROUGHOUT A LONG SERIES OF YEARS THESE WERE THOMAS JEFFERSON JAMES MADISON AND JAMES MONROE
SOME PERSONS SUPPOSED THAT MISTER TILDEN WAS A POOR SPEAKER BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE PEOPLE AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HE WAS PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO SPEAK WITH MUCH FORCE BUT TWENTY YEARS AGO FOR CLEARNESS OF STATEMENT
AND WHEN THEIR WORK WAS DONE IN TWO DAYS TO HAVE REMANDED THEM BACK TO THE PEACEFUL INDUSTRIES FROM WHICH THEY HAD BEEN CALLED TO HAVE HAD THE NATION'S WEALTH AT HIS DISPOSAL AND YET SO INCORRUPTIBLE
THE MASTERY OF FORMIDABLE DIFFICULTIES WONDER WAS IT HIS WORD SOMETIMES CUT LIKE A SHARP QUICK BLOW OR THAT THE STROKE OF HIS PEN WAS SOMETIMES LIKE A THUNDERBOLT
IT WAS NOT THE TIME FOR HESITATION OR DOUBT OR EVEN ARGUMENT HE MEANT HIS IMPERILED COUNTRY SHOULD BE SAVED AND WHATEVER BY HALF LOYALTY OR SELF SEEKING SEEMED TO STAND IN THE WAY ONLY ATTRACTED
HIS ADMINISTRATION AS A WHOLE WAS A SUCCESSFUL ONE AND HAD HE NOT SIGNED THE FUGITIVE SLAVE LAW HE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE BEEN THE NOMINEE OF HIS PARTY AT THE CONVENTION IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO
WHICH WIDENED THE BREACH BETWEEN HIM AND THE ADMINISTRATION
THE RESOLUTION WAS REFERRED TO A COMMITTEE OF WHICH HE WAS CHAIRMAN AND A REPORT WAS MADE IN FAVOR OF THE MEASURE THIS LED TO THE CONVENTION OF ANNAPOLIS AND THE SUBSEQUENT ADOPTION OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION
THEREFORE CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF CONCENTRATING HIS BUSINESS INTO ONE VAST ESTABLISHMENT AND GATHERED ABOUT HIM A FORCE OF SKILLED WORKMEN HE LOOKED UPON CHICAGO AND ITS LOCALITY AS THE COMING CENTER OF POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES
THAT BY THE INTERCESSION OF SEVERAL OF ITS LEADING MEMBERS HE WAS ADMITTED AS AN ATTORNEY BY THE COURT OF COMMON PLEAS OF ERIE COUNTY
FOR A MAGNIFICENT COURAGE FOR RARE UNSELFISHNESS FOR TRANSCENDENT ABILITIES FOR IMMEASURABLE SERVICES TO HIS COUNTRY THE FIGURE OF THE GREATEST WAR MINISTER IN MODERN TIMES
SAMUEL J TILDEN IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN THERE WAS BORN AT NEW LEBANON NEW YORK
SEVERAL FEET HIGH AN ENTERPRISE WHICH WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT HARDLY A BREAK DISCONTINUING NONE OF THE BUSINESS FIRMS WHO OCCUPIED THE BUILDING THEIR BUSINESS BEING CARRIED ON UNINTERRUPTED
THE ESTEEMED FRIEND OF JOHN BRIGHT AND OTHERS OF THE MOST NOTED PEOPLE THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN AS IT WAS WITH THEM SO IT WAS WITH STANTON HE HAD BUT LITTLE ADVANTAGES BUT HE WOULD NOT DOWN IT IS SAID THAT IF HENRY WARD BEECHER HAD GONE TO SEA
HIS EYE LOST EVERY PARTICLE OF LUSTRE AND SEEMED TO SINK BACK AND DOWN THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE STATED THE POINT HE HAD IN VIEW MISTER TILDEN ASKED HIM TO RESTATE IT ONCE OR TWICE MADE CURIOUS AND INCONSEQUENTIAL REMARKS
RETURNED TO CHICAGO HIS ACTIVE IMAGINATION HAD THOUGHT OUT MANY IMPROVEMENTS ON THE CARS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY CONSTRUCTED AND HE HAD ALSO SECURED CAPITAL WITH WHICH TO CARRY OUT HIS IDEAS FITTING UP A SHOP ON THE CHICAGO AND ALTON ROAD
THE POLITICAL ASPECT WE WILL NOT REVIVE EXCEPT TO SAY THAT MISTER TILDEN CONSENTED TO THE PECULIAR METHOD OF DETERMINING THE CASE THE DEPARTURE OF DAVID DAVIS FROM THE SUPREME BENCH IN ALL HUMAN PROBABILITY DETERMINED THE RESULT
AND WAS SELDOM OBLIGED TO REFER TO HIS LIBRARY BEFORE ANSWERING QUESTIONS IN RELATION TO THE LAW HE WAS CALLED TO THE HIGH POSITION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL IN PRESIDENT BUCHANAN'S CABINET AND ON JANUARY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
BUT A SITE IN THAT CITY WOULD BE FAR TOO EXPENSIVE IF INDEED ONE COULD HAVE BEEN FOUND SUFFICIENT FOR HIS PURPOSE ABOUT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN MILES FROM CHICAGO WAS A SWAMP IT WAS CONSIDERED WORTHLESS
FOR A CERTAIN CHURCH IN PENNSYLVANIA WHICH HAD BEEN GRIEVOUSLY EMBARRASSED HE STAYED AT THE HOUSE OF ONE OF THE MINISTERS IN BROOKLYN ONE EVENING HE SAID TO HIS HOST I AM GOING TO CALL ON SAMUEL J TILDEN AND SEE IF I CAN'T GET SOMETHING OUT OF HIM FOR OUR CHURCH HE HAS A BARREL
BUT IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT SUCH ARGUMENTS CAN GIVE BUT LITTLE HOPE IF THEY HAVE INFLUENCE AT ALL IT CANNOT BE AN INSPIRING ONE NO NEVER MIND THE REPUTATION NEVER PINE TO BE A LINCOLN OR A GARFIELD
AFTER PROLONGED AND EXCITING DEBATES RESULTING IN THE CELEBRATED MISSOURI COMPROMISE
AND YET THIS IS A CITY OF NEARLY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE THE PEOPLE ARE NOT MUDDLED WITH DRINK THEY ARE PROMPTLY PAID THEIR PERSONAL RIGHTS ARE NOT INTERFERED WITH SAVE IN RESPECT TO THE SELLING OF LIQUOR THEY ARE CONTENTED AND HAPPY
A MAN CAN SQUANDER HIS TIME CAN GAMBLE POSSIBLY BUT HE CANNOT OBTAIN DRINK THE RESULT IS THERE ARE NO POLICEMEN NO VISIBLE FORM OF GOVERNMENT SAVE MISTER PULLMAN
THE UNION AND PACIFIC WAS THEN EXCITING MUCH ATTENTION HE KNEW THAT ON THE COMPLETION OF SUCH A ROAD TRAVELERS WOULD APPRECIATE A CAR IN WHICH THEY COULD ENJOY THE COMFORTS OF HOME FOR THE ENTIRE TEDIOUS TRIP
HIS FATHER BEING A PERSONAL AND POLITICAL FRIEND OF MISTER VAN BUREN AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CELEBRATED ALBANY REGENCY HIS HOME WAS MADE A KIND OF HEADQUARTERS FOR VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THAT COUNCIL
FACULTY TO SUCCESS AT ANY RATE NEVER WAIT FOR THE SLUMBERING GENIUS TO SHOW ITSELF IF YOU DO IT WILL NEVER AWAKE BUT SLUMBER ON THROUGH ENDLESS TIME AND LEAVE YOU
BRANCHES WERE STARTED AT DETROIT SAINT LOUIS PHILADELPHIA AND VARIOUS PLACES IN EUROPE THESE ESTABLISHMENTS OF NECESSITY
JAMES MONROE THE FIFTH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS A NATIVE OF THE GRAND OLD DOMINION BEING BORN IN WESTMORELAND COUNTY VIRGINIA APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH SEVENTEEN FIFTY EIGHT
AND CLOSED BY SAYING YOU ARE AN OLD HUMBUG
BUT IT WAS AS EASY FOR THIS NATURAL MECHANIC TO CONCEIVE THE IDEA OF DRAINING THIS TRACT OF LAND AS IT WAS TO CONCEIVE METHODS TO RAISE BUILDINGS A VERY LARGE FORCE OF MEN WERE PUT TO WORK DRAINING GAS PIPES WERE LAID
AND ITS DOUBTFULNESS IN RELATION TO OTHER LEADING POINTS THE PRESIDENT SENT IT BACK FOR REVISAL ALL EFFORTS TO ATTAIN THIS FAILED AND MONROE RETURNED TO AMERICA THE TIME WAS APPROACHING FOR THE ELECTION OF A PRESIDENT
THE BUILDINGS ARE NOT MUSHROOM AFFAIRS BUT SUBSTANTIAL BRICK EDIFICES WHICH GIVE THIS PLACE AN APPEARANCE WHICH WILL COMPARE FAVORABLY WITH ANY CITY HE BUILT A FINE HOTEL AND ERECTED A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH
AND FOR AN EASY AND STRAIGHTFORWARD METHOD OF SPEECH HE HAD FEW SUPERIORS HIS LANGUAGE WAS EXCELLENT HIS MANNER THAT OF A MAN WHO HAD SOMETHING TO SAY AND WAS INTENT UPON SAYING IT HE WAS AT NO TIME A TRICKY ORATOR NOR DID HE AIM AT ROUSING THE FEELINGS
AND WHICH PASSED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE IN CONGRESS HE SUPPORTED JOHN QUINCY ADAMS IN HIS ASSERTION OF THE RIGHT OF PETITION ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY
NEITHER DO MEN LIGHT A CANDLE AND PUT IT UNDER A BUSHEL BUT ON A CANDLESTICK AND IT GIVETH LIGHT UNTO ALL THAT ARE IN THE HOUSE HOW OFTEN
TO THE ARMY IN SOUTH CAROLINA IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO HE WAS ELECTED TO THE ASSEMBLY OF VIRGINIA FROM THE COUNTY OF KING GEORGE AND WAS APPOINTED BY THAT BODY ALTHOUGH BUT TWENTY THREE YEARS OF AGE A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE
THE PRESIDENT WAS NOT BACKWARD IN HIS ASSURANCES OF A STRONG DESIRE ON HIS PART THAT SUCH SHOULD BE THE CASE THE COURSE OF THE ADMINISTRATION WAS IN CONFORMITY TO THESE ASSURANCES AND SECURED THE SUPPORT OF AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE
ON FOOT NOW ENTERED THE NATIONAL CAPITOL AS THE RULER OF A MIGHTY NATION DURING HIS ADMINISTRATION A TREATY WITH JAPAN SECURING FOR THE UNITED STATES VALUABLE COMMERCIAL PRIVILEGES WAS CONSUMMATED
AT THAT TIME THE LEADER OF THE ALBANY REGENCY AT TWENTY HE ENTERED YALE COLLEGE BUT ILL HEALTH COMPELLED HIS RETURN HOME HE HOWEVER AFTERWARD RESUMED HIS STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK
AND INFUSED VIGOR INTO EVERY DEPARTMENT OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE
WHY HE WOULD NOT DO SO IS STILL IN EXISTENCE OF THIS WE KNOW NOTHING BUT THAT HE HAD REASONS AND ASSIGNED THEM IS CERTAIN WHY HE CONSENTED TO THE METHOD OF ARBITRATION IS ONE OF THE MYSTERIES OF HIS CAREER TAKING ALL THE POSSIBILITIES INTO ACCOUNT
AND HIS DEVOTING HIMSELF TO THE OVERTHROW OF THAT GIGANTIC RING IT IS NOT OUR PURPOSE TO TREAT THE WHOLE SUBJECT YET THE MANNER OF THE BREAK WAS SO TRAGIC THAT IT SHOULD BE DETAILED WILLIAM M TWEED HAD GONE ON BUYING MEN AND LEGISLATURES AND ENRICHING HIMSELF
AND DISLOYALTY WHATEVER FAULTS THEREFORE HIS ENEMIES MAY ALLEGE THESE WILL ALL FADE AWAY IN THE SPLENDOR WITH WHICH COMING AGES WILL ENNOBLE THE GREATEST OF WAR MINISTERS IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
WAS ELECTED THE REFORM GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT EMPIRE STATE ALTHOUGH IN POLITICAL DISCORD WITH MISTER TILDEN IT IS IN NO DISPARAGING SENSE THAT WE SPEAK OF HIM IT IS IN THE SENSE OF A HISTORIAN BOUND AND OBLIGATED TO TRUTH THAT WE VIEW HIM
MISTER PULLMAN HAS BEEN LARGELY IDENTIFIED WITH THE METROPOLITAN RAILWAY AND THE EAGLETON WIRE WORKS IN NEW YORK CITY BUT THE NAME OF PULLMAN IS DESTINED TO LONG REMAIN A SYNONYM OF PHILANTHROPY
THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY TO THICKEN THE VEIL TO IMPENETRABILITY HIS HABIT WAS TO WEIGH BOTH SIDES OF EVERY QUESTION AND THEREIN HE RESEMBLED THOUGH IN OTHER PARTICULARS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THE LATE HENRY J RAYMOND THE FOUNDER OF THE NEW YORK TIMES
HE HAS PRACTICALLY DEMONSTRATED THE BENEFIT OF LEGISLATION AGAINST THE SALE OF INTOXICATING LIQUORS AS A BEVERAGE HE CLAIMS TO HAVE DONE THIS AS A BUSINESS POLICY AND DISCLAIMS ALL HONOR AS A PHILANTHROPIST WE ANSWER
ON MARCH FOURTH EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE MONROE RETIRED FROM OFFICE AND RETURNED TO HIS RESIDENCE AT OAK HILL IN VIRGINIA HE WAS CHOSEN A JUSTICE OF THE PEACE
AND COMMENCED PRACTICE AT AURORA WHERE HIS FATHER RESIDED
YOU TELL THEM THAT SAMUEL J TILDEN GAVE YOU ALL THE MONEY HE HAD EXCEPT ONE DOLLAR WHICH HE KEPT FOR HIMSELF IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WAS SATIRIZING AN APPEAL UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES
IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE HE MARRIED A DAUGHTER OF PETER KORTRIGHT A LADY OF REFINEMENT AND CULTURE HE
INFORMED THE WRITER THAT AS HE GAZED UPON MISTER TILDEN HE WAS TERRIFIED NOT A WORD DID HE UTTER HE FOLDED UP HIS BOOKS AND PAPERS AND DEPARTED
AND DIED IN WASHINGTON D C DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE WHEN FIFTEEN YEARS OLD HE BECAME A CLERK IN A BOOK STORE IN HIS NATIVE TOWN AND WITH MONEY THUS ACCUMULATED WAS ENABLED TO ATTEND KENYON COLLEGE
NINE MONTHS AFTER THE INAUGURATION OF LINCOLN HE WAS PLACED IN THE MOST RESPONSIBLE POSITION IN HIS CABINET AT THAT TIME SECRETARY OF WAR HIS LABORS IN THIS DEPARTMENT WERE INDEFATIGABLE AND MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
GRADUATING FROM THAT INSTITUTION HE BEGAN THE PRACTICE OF LAW AT THE BAR HE BECAME KNOWN AS A SOUND BUT NOT ESPECIALLY BRILLIANT PLEADER IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX HE WAS CHOSEN CHAIRMAN OF THE STATE COMMITTEE OF HIS PARTY
GROPING ON IN MIDNIGHT DARKNESS BUT TO RETURN TO STANTON WHETHER HE POSSESSED A SLUMBERING GENIUS DOES NOT APPEAR BUT CERTAIN IT IS THAT BY DOWN RIGHT HARD WORK HE GAINED A KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW
MISTER TILDEN HAD INTELLECTUAL QUALITIES OF THE VERY HIGHEST ORDER HE COULD SIT DOWN BEFORE A MASS OF INCOHERENT STATEMENTS AND FIGURES THAT WOULD DRIVE MOST MEN INSANE AND ELUCIDATE THEM BY THE MOST PAINSTAKING INVESTIGATION
BY LEVYING RECRUITS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE COUNTRY
AND ENDEAVORED TO CONCLUDE A CONVENTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF NEUTRAL RIGHTS AND AGAINST THE IMPRESSMENT OF SEAMEN IN THE MIDST OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS
TO THINK A THING IMPOSSIBLE IS TO MAKE IT SO AND HE ACCORDINGLY SET TO WORK CONTRIVING TO GAIN FOR HIMSELF AN EDUCATION CONTRACTING WITH HIS EMPLOYER TO PAY HIM THIRTY DOLLARS FOR HIS RELEASE
HE WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL ADVISER OF PRESIDENT MADISON IN THE MEASURES FOR THE RE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PUBLIC CREDIT OF THE COUNTRY
HE AT FIRST BECAME IDENTIFIED WITH THE WORK OF RAISING AND PLACING NEW FOUNDATIONS UNDER SEVERAL LARGE BUILDINGS OF THAT CITY
THE FACT THAT THE ISSUE PASSED WITHOUT CIVIL WAR IS AN OCCASION OF DEVOUT THANKFULNESS TO ALMIGHTY GOD BUT THE METHOD OF DETERMINING THE QUESTION IS ONE WHICH THE GOOD SENSE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL NEVER REPEAT MISTER TILDEN MUST HAVE HAD CONSIDERABLE HUMOR IN HIS COMPOSITION
AND INSUFFICIENT YET WHEN IT WAS CONTEMPLATED BY SOME OF HIS FRIENDS AFTER HIS RETIREMENT TO TENDER HIM A HANDSOME GIFT OF MONEY HE RESOLUTELY AND UNHESITATINGLY FORBADE IT AND THE PROJECT HAD TO BE ABANDONED
THIS GREAT LEGAL SUCCESS TOGETHER WITH SEVERAL OTHERS WON FOR HIM A NATIONAL REPUTATION IT HAS BEEN STATED BY ONE OF THE LEADING JURISTS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THE CAUSE OF NINE OUT OF TEN OF THE FAILURES IN THE LEGAL PROFESSION
IT WERE A SPECIAL PROVINCIAL INTERPOSITION TO INCLINE THE PRESIDENT TO GO OUT OF HIS OWN PARTY AND SELECT THIS MAN FOR THIS MOST RESPONSIBLE OF ALL TRUSTS SAVE HIS OWN WITH AN UNFLINCHING FORCE
HE WORKED FOR A TIME IN A FURNITURE ESTABLISHMENT BUT THIS KIND OF EMPLOYMENT DID NOT SATISFY HIS ACTIVE NATURE AND HE WENT TO CHICAGO WHERE HIS ENTERPRISE COULD HAVE SEA ROOM
AFTER THE ACCEPTANCE BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE CONCLUSION MISTER TILDEN WILL NEVER BE CONSIDERED INFERIOR IN INTELLECT AND LEARNING TO THE MANY GREAT MEN OF WHOM NEW YORK CAN PROUDLY BOAST
YES REPLIED MATILDA AND I AM PREPARED FOR EVERY THING BUT MY FATHER'S REFUSAL TO MY DEAR MOTHER YOUR FATHER HAS NOT REFUSED YOUR MOTHER'S REQUEST REPLIED SANDFORD SHE WAS LEAPING FROM HER SEAT IN ECSTASY BUT
MISS WOODLEY DID NOT FAIL TO GIVE BOTH GENTLEMEN REASON TO BELIEVE A CONTENTION OF THIS NATURE WAS THE ACTUAL STATE OF MISS MILNER'S MIND
FOR I PITY YOU AND THAT SENSATION I WOULD GLADLY EXCHANGE FOR APPROBATION IF YOU REALLY FEEL COMPASSION FOR ME AND I BELIEVE YOU DO CONTRIVE SOME MEANS BY YOUR ANSWERS TO LORD ELMWOOD TO PACIFY HIM WITHOUT INVOLVING ME IN RUIN
CONSTANTLY ON THE VERGE OF DISOBEYING MY COMMANDS THAT YOU MAY RECEDE AND GAIN MY GOOD WILL BY YOUR FORBEARANCE BUT KNOW MISTER SANDFORD THAT I WILL NOT SUFFER THIS MUCH LONGER IF YOU CHUSE IN EVERY CONVERSATION WE HAVE TOGETHER
YET THOUGH MISS MILNER AT THOSE TIMES WAS SOFTENED INTO MELANCHOLY SHE BY NO MEANS APPEARED UNHAPPY
MISS WOODLEY JUST THEN ENTERED HER APARTMENT AND SHE FOUND HERSELF SO MUCH A COWARD
BUT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PERIOD RESENTMENT FLEW TO MISS MILNER'S FACE AND SHE DARTED A PIERCING LOOK AT MISTER SANDFORD WHICH MORE POINTEDLY EXPRESSED THAT SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HIM THAN IF SHE HAD SPOKEN VOLUMES IN HER USUAL STRAIN OF RAILLERY
NOT A WORD I WISH HIM TO MARRY THAT I MAY THEN CONCLUDE THE DEEDS IN RESPECT TO MY ESTATE AND THE ONLY CHILD OF SIR WILLIAM WINTERTON A RICH HEIRESS WAS THE WIFE I MEANT TO PROPOSE
WITHOUT SHEWING MY RESENTMENT EVEN TO THE HOUR OF MY DEATH HE WAS GOING OUT OF THE ROOM BUT BEFORE WE BID ADIEU TO THE SUBJECT FOR EVER MY LORD THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON WHOM I NAMED TO YOU DO YOU MEAN MISS WOODLEY OH BY ALL MEANS LET HER LIVE AT ELMWOOD HOUSE TOO
WHERE SHE HAD BEEN TAKING OFF SOME PART OF HER DRESS WHEN DORRIFORTH'S SERVANT CAME TO ACQUAINT HER THAT HIS MASTER WAS ALONE IN HIS STUDY AND BEGGED TO SPEAK WITH HER
HEAVEN IS MY WITNESS IF I KNEW IF I COULD CONCEIVE THE MEANS HOW TO MAKE HER HAPPY I WOULD SACRIFICE MY OWN HAPPINESS TO HERS MY LORD SAID MISS WOODLEY WITH A SMILE
MISS WOODLEY PROMISED HER NOT TO DECEIVE HER AND SOON AFTER AS THEY HEARD THE SERVANTS PASS ABOUT THE HOUSE AND THE CLOCK HAD STRUCK SIX MISS WOODLEY WENT TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM SHE FOUND LORD ELMWOOD THERE IN HIS TRAVELLING DRESS STANDING PENSIVELY BY THE FIRE PLACE
SIR EDWARD IN THE COURSE OF CONVERSATION ENQUIRED
AT A DINNER GIVEN BY LORD ELMWOOD SIR EDWARD WAS ANNOUNCED AS AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR MISS MILNER DID NOT SUPPOSE HIM SUCH
AND IN THE NAME OF GOD AND YOUR OWN HAPPINESS SINCE THIS IS THE STATE OF YOU BOTH LET ME PUT IT OUT OF YOUR POWER TO PART LORD ELMWOOD GAZED AT HIM WITH WONDER AND YET AS IF ENRAPTURED BY THE SUDDEN CHANGE THIS CONDUCT GAVE TO HIS PROSPECTS
YOU ARE ONLY MARRIED BY YOUR OWN CHURCH AND CONSCIENCE NOT BY YOUR WIFE'S OR BY THE LAW OF THE LAND AND LET ME ADVISE YOU NOT TO DEFER THAT MARRIAGE LONG LEST IN THE TIME YOU DISAGREE AND SHE SHOULD REFUSE TO BECOME YOUR LEGAL SPOUSE
THE INCLINATION HE MADE WITH HIS KNEES BENT TOWARDS THE GROUND STOPPED LORD ELMWOOD INSTANTLY BUT THOUGH IT BROKE IN UPON HIS WORDS IT DID NOT ALTER ONE ANGRY LOOK HIS EYES DARTED AND HIS LIPS TREMBLED WITH INDIGNATION
EVERY NECESSARY CEREMONY HAS TAKEN PLACE HERE THEN YOUR LORDSHIP IS NO LONGER IN ORDERS SAID MISS WOODLEY NO THEY HAVE BEEN RESIGNED THESE FIVE DAYS MY LORD I GIVE YOU JOY SAID MISS MILNER
THE EARL RESUMED NOR CAN IT BE A HARDSHIP TO OBEY THIS COMMAND SHE CANNOT LAMENT THE SEPARATION FROM A PARENT WHOM SHE NEVER KNEW SANDFORD WAS GOING EAGERLY TO PROVE THE ERROR OF THAT ASSERTION BUT HE PREVENTED HIM SAYING IN A WORD
DO NOT SEE HIM ANY MORE BUT IF YOU HOPE YOUR MIND WOULD BE EASIER WERE YOU TO BID EACH OTHER ADIEU IN A MORE DIRECT MANNER THAN YOU DID LAST NIGHT LET US GO DOWN AND BREAKFAST WITH HIM I'LL GO BEFORE AND PREPARE HIM FOR YOUR RECEPTION YOU SHALL NOT SURPRISE HIM
DIRECTED IMMEDIATELY TO HIM AND A SEVERE WORD OF HIS INSTEAD OF EXASPERATING WAS SURE TO SUBDUE HER THIS WAS THE CASE AT PRESENT HIS WORDS WOUNDED HER TO THE HEART
THE TWO PARTIES WOULD OCCASIONALLY JOIN AND OF COURSE SANDFORD AND SHE AT THOSE TIMES MET YET SO DISTANT
WAS DENIED TO ALL HER VISITORS WHETHER THIS AROSE FROM PURE MELANCHOLY OR THE STILL LINGERING HOPE OF MAKING HER CONQUEST BY THAT SEDATENESS OF MANNERS WHICH SHE KNEW HER GUARDIAN ADMIRED SHE HERSELF PERHAPS DID NOT PERFECTLY KNOW
DORRIFORTH SAW HER CONCERN UPON THIS LAST TRIFLING OCCASION WITH A SECRET PLEASURE AND AN ADMIRATION THAT SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE EXCITED SHE ONCE INSINUATED TO HIM TO BE A MEDIATOR BETWEEN THEM
BUT BEFORE ANY ACCOMMODATION COULD TAKE PLACE THE PEACE AND COMPOSURE OF THEIR ABODE
MISTER SANDFORD FINDING HIS FRIEND DORRIFORTH FREQUENTLY PERPLEXED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS WARD AND HE HIMSELF THINKING HER INCORRIGIBLE
AND AFTER SITTING SEVERAL MINUTES AND TALKING UPON INDIFFERENT SUBJECTS TO WHICH HIS WARD REPLIED WITH A DEJECTION IN HER VOICE AND MANNER HE SAID PERHAPS I AM WRONG MISS MILNER BUT I HAVE OBSERVED THAT YOU ARE LATELY MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN USUAL
THERE IS ONE FAULT HOWEVER MISTER SANDFORD I CANNOT LAY TO HER CHARGE AND WHAT IS THAT MY LORD CRIED SANDFORD EAGERLY WHAT IS THAT ONE FAULT WHICH MISS MILNER HAS NOT I NEVER REPLIED LORD ELMWOOD
THIS IS A CONDUCT AGAINST WHICH IT IS MY DUTY TO GUARD YOU AND YOU SHALL NO LONGER DECEIVE EITHER HIM OR YOURSELF
FOR THAT SHE ALSO LOVED HIM AND FOR BEING HONOURED WITH THE FRIENDSHIP OF HER FATHER SHE LOOKED UP TO HIM WITH REVERENCE FOR MATILDA WITH AN EXCELLENT UNDERSTANDING A SEDATENESS ABOVE HER YEARS AND EARLY ACCUSTOMED TO THE MOST PRIVATE CONVERSE
IT SEEMED BUT A VERY SHORT TIME THEY WERE AT BREAKFAST WHEN THE CARRIAGE THAT WAS TO TAKE LORD ELMWOOD AWAY DROVE TO THE DOOR MISS MILNER STARTED AT THE SOUND SO DID HE BUT SHE HAD NEARLY DROPPED HER CUP AND SAUCER ON WHICH SANDFORD TOOK THEM OUT OF HER HAND
IT WAS WITHOUT ANY MARKS EITHER OF SATISFACTION OR CONCERN MISS MILNER'S PRIDE BEGAN TO BE ALARMED WHILE HE WAS MISTER DORRIFORTH AND CONFINED TO A SINGLE LIFE
AND COULD NOT RESIST THE STRONG IMPULSE TO SAY YOU HAVE DONE JUST THEN MY LORD LIKE MISS MILNER FOR SHE HAS NOT BEEN IN BED THE WHOLE NIGHT MISS WOODLEY SPOKE THIS IN A NEGLIGENT MANNER AND YET LORD ELMWOOD ECHOED BACK THE WORDS WITH SOLICITUDE HAS NOT MISS MILNER BEEN IN BED THE WHOLE NIGHT
IT IS ALWAYS PROPER ANSWERED SANDFORD FOR YOU TO THINK OF HIM THOUGH HE SHOULD NEVER THINK ON YOU SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND SAID THAT SHE DID THINK OF HIM BUT SHE FELT AN APPREHENSION OF MENTIONING HIS NAME AND SHE WEPT BITTERLY WHILE SHE SPOKE DO NOT THINK I REPROVED YOU
SANDFORD TOOK IT AND PUTTING IT UP ASKED FEARFULLY WHAT THOSE TWO REASONS WERE FIRST
WHICH AM I TO BELIEVE WHICH YOU PLEASE WAS HER ANSWER WHILE SHE DISCOVERED AN INSULTED DIGNITY
CALLED SANDFORD APART AND SAID TO HIM THAT AS THE MALEVOLENCE WHICH HE ONCE OBSERVED BETWEEN HIM AND RUSHBROOK HAD HE PERCEIVED SUBSIDED HE ADVISED HIM IF HE WAS A WELL WISHER TO THE YOUNG MAN TO SOUND HIS HEART AND COUNSEL HIM
BUT THE MOST ROMANTIC AFFECTION ON THE PART OF LORD ELMWOOD HAD MISS MILNER TO DEPEND AND HIS LORDSHIP WAS NOT A MAN TO BE SUSPECTED OF SUBMITTING TO THE EXCESS OF ANY PASSION
YET SAID AFTER ALL I DARE NOT SEE HIM AGAIN YOU MAY DO AS YOU PLEASE SAID MISS WOODLEY BUT I WILL I THAT HAVE LIVED FOR SO MANY YEARS UNDER THE SAME ROOF WITH HIM AND ON THE MOST FRIENDLY TERMS AND HE GOING AWAY PERHAPS FOR THESE TEN YEARS PERHAPS FOR EVER
WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM WAS A PRESENT FROM LADY LUNEHAM AND WOULD CERTAINLY CURE HIM AND SHE PRESSED IT UPON HIM WITH SUCH AN ANXIOUS EARNESTNESS THAT WITH ALL HIS CHURLISHNESS HE COULD NOT REFUSE TAKING IT
AND IF LORD FREDERICK SHOULD NOT FOLLOW THERE IS AN END OF YOUR SUSPICIONS I SHALL NOT EASILY PREVAIL UPON MISS MILNER TO LEAVE TOWN REPLIED HE WHILE IT IS IN THE HIGHEST FASHION
I SHOULD THINK IT A DISRESPECT NOT TO SEE HIM TO THE LAST MOMENT OF HIS REMAINING IN THE HOUSE THEN DO YOU GO SAID MISS MILNER EAGERLY AND IF HE SHOULD ASK FOR ME I WILL GLADLY COME YOU KNOW BUT IF HE DOES NOT ASK FOR ME I WILL NOT AND PRAY DON'T DECEIVE ME
SANDFORD OBSERVED IT AND WAS ALL HUMBLENESS BOTH IN HIS WORDS AND LOOKS IN ORDER TO SOFTEN HIM AS SOON AS THE BREAKFAST WAS REMOVED LORD ELMWOOD DREW THE LETTER FROM HIS POCKET AND HOLDING IT TOWARDS SANDFORD SAID THAT
TO SUFFER THAT SHE MAY RESIDE AT ONE OF MY SEATS DISPENSING AT THE SAME TIME WITH MY EVER SEEING HER AND YOU WILL COMPLY I WILL TILL SHE ENCROACHES ON THIS CONCESSION AND DARES TO HOPE FOR A GREATER
AND I HOPE YOU FOUND BENEFIT FROM THEM SAID MISS MILNER WITH GREAT KINDNESS AS SHE ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND WALKED SLOWLY OUT OF THE ROOM THOUGH MISS WOODLEY FOLLOWED HER SO THAT MISTER SANDFORD WAS LEFT ALONE WITH LORD ELMWOOD
LET HER DAUGHTER GO THERE THE FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS I AM DOWN IN THE SUMMER SHE MAY EASILY IN THAT EXTENSIVE HOUSE AVOID ME WHILE SHE DOES SHE LIVES IN SECURITY WHEN SHE DOES NOT YOU KNOW MY RESOLUTION SANDFORD BOWED
AND MARRIED THEM WITH VOICE AND MANNERS SO SERIOUS SO SOLEMN AND SO FERVENT HE PERFORMED THESE RITES THAT EVERY IDEA OF JEST OR EVEN OF LIGHTNESS WAS ABSENT FROM THE MIND OF ALL WHO WERE PRESENT MISS MILNER COVERED WITH SHAME SUNK
TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY TO WAIT UPON HIM AND LET HIM KNOW THAT HIS LORD HAD ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THE CONSENT HE HAD GIVEN FOR HIS DAUGHTER TO BE ADMITTED AT ELMWOOD CASTLE AND UPON WHAT RESTRICTIONS THAT HE HAD FARTHER UTTERED THE SEVEREST THREATS
NOT TO ACT AGAINST THE WILL OF HIS NEAREST RELATION AND FRIEND I MYSELF AM TOO HASTY CONTINUED LORD ELMWOOD AND UNHAPPILY TOO MUCH DETERMINED UPON WHAT I HAVE ONCE THOUGH PERHAPS RASHLY SAID
SHOULD THESE RESTRICTIONS EVER BE INFRINGED SANDFORD THANKED GIFFARD FOR HIS FRIENDLY INFORMATION IT SERVED HIM AS A SECOND WARNING OF THE CIRCUMSPECTION THAT WAS NECESSARY AND HAVING TAKEN LEAVE OF HIS FRIEND AND PATRON
SHE COMPLAINED TO MISS WOODLEY WHO ADVISED HER TO HAVE PATIENCE BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THE VIRTUES IN WHICH SHE WAS THE LEAST PRACTISED ENCOURAGED NEVERTHELESS BY HER FRIEND IN THE COMMENDABLE DESIRE OF GAINING THE AFFECTIONS OF HIM
ONCE MORE TO CHEER THEIR SOLITARY DWELLING NO SOONER WERE THE FIRST KIND GREETINGS OVER THAN THE DREAD OF WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO INFORM THEM OF POSSESSED POOR MATILDA AND MISS WOODLEY SO POWERFULLY THAT ALL THEIR GLADNESS WAS CHANGED INTO AFFRIGHT
NO AGREEMENT ON HIS ACCOUNT WITH THE FRIENDS OF THE LADY I HAVE POINTED OUT SAID LORD ELMWOOD NOTHING BEYOND IMPLICATIONS HAVE PASSED BETWIXT HER FAMILY AND MYSELF AT PRESENT AND IF THE PERSON ON WHOM HE HAS FIXED HIS AFFECTIONS
WHEN MISS MILNER RETIRED TO HER BED CHAMBER MISS WOODLEY WENT WITH HER NOR WOULD LEAVE HER THE WHOLE NIGHT BUT IN VAIN DID SHE PERSUADE HER TO REST SHE ABSOLUTELY REFUSED AND DECLARED SHE WOULD NEVER FROM THAT HOUR INDULGE REPOSE
I AM UNDECEIVED NOW AND SHALL NEVER TAKE THAT LIBERTY AGAIN AS LORD ELMWOOD ALWAYS TREATED SANDFORD WITH THE UTMOST RESPECT HE BEGAN TO FEAR HE HAD BEEN DEFICIENT UPON THIS OCCASION AND THE DISPOSITION WHICH HAD INDUCED HIM TO TAKE HIS WARD'S PART
ON WHAT PRETENCE TO ME IT WAS PREFERENCE OF A SINGLE LIFE BUT I SUSPECT IT IS WHAT HE IMAGINES TO BE LOVE
SORROWFUL AND AFFECTING AS THIS INTERVIEW HAD BEEN RUSHBROOK AS HE RODE HOME REFLECTED UPON IT WITH THE MOST INORDINATE DELIGHT AND HAD HE NOT SEEN DECLINE OF HEALTH IN THE LOOKS AND BEHAVIOUR OF LADY MATILDA HIS FELICITY HAD BEEN UNBOUNDED
NAY SHE ANTICIPATED A DISAPPOINTMENT AS SHE HAD BEFORE ANTICIPATED HER SUCCESS BY TURNS FEELING THE KEENEST EMOTIONS FROM HOPE AND FROM DESPAIR AS THESE PASSIONS ALTERNATELY GOVERNED HER
BUT I HAVE A QUESTION TO ASK YOU AND TO WHICH I REQUIRE A SERIOUS AND UNEQUIVOCAL ANSWER DO YOU EXPECT LORD FREDERICK IN THE COUNTRY WITHOUT HESITATION SHE REPLIED I DO ONE MORE QUESTION I HAVE TO ASK MADAM
I WILL WHILE SHE AVOIDS MY SIGHT OR THE GIVING ME ANY REMEMBRANCE OF HER BUT IF WHETHER BY DESIGN OR BY ACCIDENT I EVER SEE OR HEAR FROM HER THAT MOMENT MY COMPLIANCE TO HER MOTHER'S SUPPLICATION CEASES AND I ABANDON HER ONCE MORE
AND SET FORTH YOUR DANGER IN THE LIGHT IT APPEARED TO ME BUT THOUGH OLD AND A PRIEST I CAN SUBMIT TO THINK I HAVE BEEN IN AN ERROR AND I NOW FIRMLY BELIEVE IT IS FOR THE WELFARE OF YOU BOTH TO BECOME MAN AND WIFE MY LORD TAKE THIS WOMAN'S MARRIAGE VOWS
THOUGH HER'S WERE SOFTENED BY SORROW WHILE HIS WERE MADE AUSTERE BY THE SELF SAME CAUSE WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN SAID HIS UNCLE WITH A FROWN
WHEN THE MISFORTUNE IS BUT IDEAL AND MISS MILNER FOUND INFINITE GRATIFICATION IN BEING TOLD
AT LEAST FIX THE TIME YOU MEAN TO GO DURING THE AUTUMN AND BE FIRM TO YOUR DETERMINATION BUT IN THE AUTUMN REPLIED DORRIFORTH
YET SHE HAD THE PRUDENCE TO CONCEAL THOSE VAGUE HOPES FROM HIS CHILD LEST A DISAPPOINTMENT MIGHT PROVE FATAL AND ASSUMING A BEHAVIOUR NEITHER TOO MUCH ELATED OR DEPRESSED SHE ADVISED THAT THEY SHOULD HOPE FOR THE BEST BUT YET AS USUAL EXPECT AND PREPARE FOR THE WORST
THOSE INVOLUNTARY SIGHS HOWEVER THAT MISS WOODLEY HAD LONG AGO OBSERVED
THREE HOURS AGO HAD THE COURAGE TO VINDICATE YOUR OWN CAUSE BEFORE A WHOLE COMPANY OF WHOM MANY WERE YOUR ADVERSARIES DO YOU WANT AN ADVOCATE BEFORE YOUR GUARDIAN ALONE WHO HAS EVER TREATED YOU WITH TENDERNESS
TO ENTERTAIN HOPES AND HE LOOKED AGAIN AT MISS MILNER DOES YOUR HEAD ACHE MISS MILNER ASKED HER FRIEND SEEING HER HOLD IT WITH HER HAND VERY MUCH RETURNED SHE MISTER SANDFORD SAID MISS WOODLEY
SANDFORD WENT ON I KNOW NO TIE NO BOND NO INNOCENCE THAT IS A PROTECTION WHEN YOU FEEL RESENTMENT YOU ARE RIGHT HE REPLIED SIGNIFICANTLY THEN HOW MY LORD CAN YOU ENCOURAGE ME TO SPEAK ON
BUT AS MISS WOODLEY PERCEIVED THAT SHE WAS INCLINED TO INFRINGE THIS DELICACY OF WHICH SHE HAD SO PROPER A SENSE SHE EASILY PERSUADED HER IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MOST SUSPICIOUS PERSON
AS TO WHAT YOU HAVE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT HAS MADE IMPRESSION ENOUGH ON MY MEMORY TO ENABLE ME TO REPEAT IT I AM GLAD IT HAS NOT AND MY ANSWER TO YOUR UNCLE IS TO BE SIMPLY THAT YOU WILL NOT OBEY HIM
SANDFORD NOW READ THE LETTER TO HER AND REPEATED AS NEARLY AS HE COULD REMEMBER THE WHOLE OF THE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN LORD ELMWOOD AND HIMSELF NOT EVEN SPARING THROUGH AN ERRONEOUS DELICACY ANY OF THOSE THREATS HER FATHER HAD DENOUNCED
THEN COME SIR LET US BE ON AN EQUAL FOOTING THROUGH YOU AND NOW SPEAK OUT HIS THOUGHTS FREELY AND HEAR MINE IN RETURN
AND USE ALL MY POWER TO RENDER MYSELF WORTHY OF THE UNION FOR WHICH HE DESIGNS ME AND THIS IS NOT ONLY YOUR SOLEMN PROMISE BUT YOUR FIXED DETERMINATION NAY WHY WILL YOU SEARCH MY HEART TO THE BOTTOM WHEN THE SURFACE OUGHT TO CONTENT YOU
I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT HE RETURNED EAGERLY FOR IT IS MY EARNEST DESIRE TO HAVE YOU WITH ME YOUR WELFARE IS DEAR TO ME AS MY OWN AND WERE WE APART CONTINUAL APPREHENSIONS WOULD PREY UPON MY MIND
BUT TO THE MIND OF LORD ELMWOOD THE MERIT WAS INFINITE AND UPON THE DEPARTURE OF SANDFORD HE BEGAN TO BE UNUSUALLY CHEERFUL HE FIRST PLEASANTLY REPROACHED THE LADIES FOR NOT OFFERING HIM A PLACE IN THEIR BOX AT THE OPERA
WHO POSSESSED ALL HER OWN SHE HOWEVER LEFT NO MEANS UNATTEMPTED FOR THE CONQUEST BUT SHE BEGAN WITH TOO GREAT A CERTAINTY OF SUCCESS NOT TO BE SENSIBLE OF THE DEEPEST MORTIFICATION IN THE DISAPPOINTMENT
EITHER TO EXHORT HER TO HER DUTY OR TO WARN HER AGAINST HER FOLLY SHE WAS EVEN IN PERFECT GOOD HUMOUR WITH MISS FENTON AND ADDED FRIENDSHIP TO HOSPITALITY
MISTER SANDFORD WHO CAME WITH LORD ELMWOOD TO THE NEIGHBOURING SEAT
BETWEEN LADY ELMWOOD AND MISS WOODLEY WAS PERFECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE WHOLE FATAL HISTORY OF HER MOTHER AND WAS BY HER TAUGHT THE RESPECT AND ADMIRATION OF HER FATHER'S VIRTUES WHICH THEY JUSTLY MERITED NOTWITHSTANDING THE JOY OF MISTER SANDFORD'S PRESENCE
AND RUSHBROOK BY HIS ENTREATIES NOW GAINED THE INTELLIGENCE WHO THE NOBLEMAN WAS WHO ADDRESSED MATILDA AND ON WHAT VIEWS BUT WAS RESTRAINED TO PATIENCE BY SANDFORD'S ARGUMENTS AND THREATS
THE TEAR STARTED IN HER EYE AT THE EARNESTNESS THAT ACCOMPANIED THESE WORDS HE SAW IT AND TO SOFTEN HER STILL MORE WITH THE SENSE OF HIS ESTEEM FOR HER HE INCREASED HIS EARNESTNESS WHILE HE SAID IF YOU WILL TAKE THE RESOLUTION TO QUIT LONDON
WHERE THEIR OWN INCLINATIONS DO NOT FIRST POINT OUT THE CHOICE
YOU MAY HAVE CAUSE TO RECALL IT I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE SAID REPLIED SANDFORD YOU HAVE SAID YOU GRANT LADY ELMWOOD'S REQUEST YOU CANNOT RECALL THESE WORDS NOR I MY GRATITUDE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HER REQUEST IS RETURNED HE NOT EXACTLY MY LORD
WITHIN A YEAR MISTER SANDFORD WHO CAN TELL WHAT STRANGE EVENTS MAY NOT OCCUR TO CHANGE ALL OUR PROSPECTS EVEN MY PASSION MAY DECLINE IN THAT EXPECTATION THEN THE FAILURE OF WHICH YOURSELF MUST ANSWER FOR
SANDFORD ASKED OF DORRIFORTH TO WHICH HE REPLIED NO BUT I HOPE MISTER SANDFORD YOU WILL PERMIT ME TO KNOW SAID MISS MILNER FOR AS SHE NOW MEANT TO TORMENT HIM BY WHAT SHE SAID
AT HER'S WAS SO SCRUPULOUSLY EXACT IN THE OBSERVANCE OF HIS WORD NEVER TO ENTER A HOUSE OF MISS MILNER'S THAT HE WOULD NOT EVEN CALL UPON HIS FRIEND DORRIFORTH THERE BUT IN THEIR WALKS AND AT LORD ELMWOOD'S
IN WHICH MISTER SANDFORD WAS TREATED AND MISS WOODLEY TURNED TO HIM WITH A BENEVOLENT SMILE UPON HER FACE HOPING TO SET HIM AN EXAMPLE OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HE SHOULD RECEIVE THE REPROACH HER GOOD WISHES DID NOT SUCCEED
HE WILL NOT THEN SO EVIDENTLY FOLLOW
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO HAVE STRETCHED OUT SAID GRIGGS IN A WHISPER I THOUGHT WE WERE NEVER GOING TO GET HERE THEN TO THE DOCTOR
AND WHEN I BEGIN TO FIRE AT THEM PRETTY SHARPLY THEY'LL TURN BACK AT ONCE GET TO THEIR HORSES AND JOIN THEIR MATES TO HAVE A PALAVER AND COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT ISN'T SAFE TO STOP IN THE VALLEY BECAUSE THEY'LL BE EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT FOR FIRE TO BE OPENED BY US
THAT'S RIGHT SIR I'LL SAY MY LESSON AS SOON AS IT'S DAYBREAK I SHALL MOVE DOWN THE GULLY RIGHT ON IN THE DIRECTION WHERE I BELIEVE THE INDIANS ARE ENCAMPED AND AS SOON AS I THINK I'M NEAR ENOUGH I'M GOING TO BEGIN SHOOTING WHEREVER I SEE A CHANCE AND PICKING UP MY BIRDS
AND ONE NEVER KNOWS WHAT THEY MAY BE ABOUT SOME QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER THE ADVENTURERS WERE ALL IN SHELTER ONE OF THE CELLS OF THE LOWER RANGE HAVING BEEN TURNED INTO A TEMPORARY MESS ROOM
I'VE BEEN UP AT THE LOOKOUT WITH YOUR FATHER AND WE MADE OUT TWO INDIANS CRAWLING TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF OVER THERE JUST LIKE A COUPLE OF BIG RED SLUGS ON A WET NIGHT THEN THEY'RE WATCHING US PANTED CHRIS JUST AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN MY LAD
TWO HOLD MY ROPE UP WITH THE BARREL THOSE AT THE SURFACE NEEDED NO SECOND ORDER BUT BEGAN TO HAUL AWAY
YOU BOYS EASE DOWN THE BARREL TILL I SHOUT DON'T LET IT GO WHEN THE WATER GRABS IT LOWER AWAY RIGHT I HAVE IT NOW EASE A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE NOW KEEP TIGHT
WHILE THE DOCTOR WHO LOOKED ANXIOUS HELD ONE OF HIS HANDS BETTER NOW PANTED GRIGGS THAT'S BEAUTIFUL WATER COLD AND SWEET BUT I SHOULD HAVE TO BE VERY BAD BEFORE I DARED GO DOWN TO GET ANY MORE I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS SUCH A CUR
FROM THE WILD EXCITEMENT AND RISK OF HIS POSITION BY THE BARRIER
INVENTED A HOST OF HORRORS CHIEF AMONG WHICH WAS THAT IN WHICH HE PICTURED TO HIMSELF THE INDIANS STEALING UP TO THE DEFENDERS OF THE BARRIER
OH MY WORD HOW IT USED TO SCORCH IT WAS JUST AS IF THE HAZE WAS ONE GREAT BURNING GLASS OH I SAY CRIED NED DOLEFULLY I WISH YOU WOULDN'T WOULDN'T WHAT TALK ABOUT THE HEAT ON THE SALT PLAINS
WE COULD SEE EVERY MOVEMENT EXCEPT WHEN YOU GALLOPED OUT OF SIGHT IT ALL STOOD OUT LIKE A PICTURE AGAINST THE CLEAR MORNING SKY WHILE THERE WE WERE NEARLY ALL THE TIME
FOR THE SHARP CRACK OF A RIFLE BROUGHT HIM OUT OF HIS MUSINGS TO GAZE SHARPLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BARRIER FAR AWAY FROM WHERE HE WAS WAITING AND WONDERING NOW WHETHER THERE WAS ANY MORE FIGHTING ON THE WAY ANOTHER SHARP CRACK AND CHRIS'S EXCITEMENT INCREASED
I WONDER WHAT OUR NEXT CAMPING PLACE MAY BE LIKE THAT RUINED CITY DESCRIBED BY THE OLD PROSPECTOR PERHAPS SAID NED LAUGHING BUT WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO THEN LOAD THE MULES WITH GOLD AND GO BACK AGAIN I HOPE NOT CRIED CHRIS I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK
WELL YES I WON'T SAY IT DON'T DOCTOR BUT NOT WORSE THAN I FEEL SOMEWHERE ELSE I SAY THOUGH HADN'T WE BETTER MAKE HASTE BACK TO THE FORT YES YOU FEEL FAINT DON'T YOU HORRIBLY SAID GRIGGS GIVING CHRIS A COMICAL LOOK LET'S GO THEN
WHERE THE DOCTOR CALLED A HALT ONCE MORE BUT ALL WAS STILL AND BLACKER THAN EVER AS GRIGGS WITH CHRIS AT HIS SIDE TURNED OFF TO THE RIGHT TO LEAD THE PARTY SLOWLY ONWARD TOWARDS THE NARROWS WHERE ALL STOOD AT LAST HOT AND WEARY
THAT'S THE WORST OF IT SAID CHRIS YES BUT THIS TIME THEY'VE GOT TO LIKE AND I KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM DAYBREAK AT LAST AND WITH THAT DAWN ALL DOUBTS ABOUT THE MULE CONVOY WERE AT AN END FOR THE FIRST STREAKS OF DAWN SHOWED THEM ABOUT A MILE AHEAD
DID YOU EVER SEE SUCH A COWARD BEFORE COME ALONG DOWN BELOW THERE AND SEE ABOUT A FIRE AND A MEAL SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY LET IT GO NOW GRIGGS YOU DIDN'T FEEL MORE NERVOUS THAN I DID I WAS WORSE I BELIEVE FOR I FELT GUILTY AS WELL FOR LETTING YOU GO DOWN
THEY ARE BOUND TO FEEL THEIR WAY STEP BY STEP IF THEY FOLLOW AT ALL MOST LIKELY THEY'LL WAIT TILL MORNING WHEN THEY'LL PICK UP OUR TRAIL AND THEN COME ON AS FAST AS THEY CAN RUN SIR THEY WON'T RIDE GRIGGS FINISHED OFF WITH A LOUD CHUCKLE
I LIKED THAT PONY HE MADE ME JEALOUS OF YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT HIM SAID CHRIS QUICKLY I TRIED SO HARD TO SAVE HIM YOU DID MY LAD YOU DID
WE SHALL FIND THAT OUT TO MORROW SAID THE DOCTOR
BUT I SHOULDN'T BE A BIT SURPRISED TO FIND THAT THIS IS ONLY A PATCH OF GOOD LAND ROUND AND ABOUT THESE MOUNTAINS AND THAT IF WE WENT FAR ENOUGH IN ANY DIRECTION WE SHOULD COME TO THE SALT PLAINS AGAIN SHUTTING IT IN AND KEEPING PEOPLE BACK
I DON'T LIKE GOING OFF AND LEAVING YOU AND I DON'T LIKE YOU TO GO MISTER BOURNE SAID CHRIS HOLDING OUT HIS HAND WHICH WAS WARMLY GRASPED TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF NED YES AND YOU SAID THE BOY SADLY THE NEXT MINUTE CHRIS WAS STANDING BY HIS MUSTANG'S HEAD
AND IT WAS DURING THIS RIDE THAT THE BOY BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER THE EYESIGHT OF THE INDIANS WAS MUCH BETTER THAN THEIR OWN FOR HE SOON FOUND THAT ONCE MORE HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE OUT ANY ATTEMPT AT GUIDANCE AND TRUST ENTIRELY TO HIS PONY
AND CHRIS MOVED FORWARD GAVE THE PONY HIS HEAD ONCE MORE AND THE CLEVER LITTLE ANIMAL PACED STEADILY ON FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS AND THEN TURNED OFF TO ITS LEFT AND BEGAN TO ASCEND HAH WHO WOULDN'T BE A PONY SAID GRIGGS AS CHRIS DREW REIN
BY THE TIME THIS WAS FINISHED THE SUN HAD SUNK FAR BELOW THE ROCKS ON HIS LEFT AND THE DREAMY RESTFUL STATE INTO WHICH THE BOY HAD BEEN FALLING PASSED AWAY FOR THE THOUGHTS THAT CAME FAST NOW WERE BEGINNING TO GROW TROUBLOUS
THAT WILL BE THE SIGNAL FOR US TO MOUNT AND RIDE FOR OUR LIVES INDIANS ARE SWIFT OF FOOT BOY IT SEEMED AN HOUR DURING WHICH EVERY EAR WAS ON THE STRAIN BUT PROBABLY IT WAS NOT A FOURTH OF THAT TIME
THEY'RE MADE DIFFERENTLY TO WHAT WE ARE IF THEY CAN WHISPERED THE AMERICAN DRYLY I'M LEAVING EVERYTHING TO MY NAG AND YOU'D BETTER DO THE SAME THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING SAID CHRIS YOU DON'T THINK THAT WAS AN INDIAN THEN NO ONLY SOME LITTLE ANIMAL THAT WE STARTED
YES AND THOSE BIG HORNED SHEEP BUT I FEEL SURE HE WAS LAUGHING AT US ABOUT THEIR JUMPING ABOUT THE PRECIPICES AND RUNNING ALONG LEDGES FULL GALLOP WHEN THEY'RE ONLY A FEW INCHES WIDE OH I DON'T KNOW
IT SEEMED TO CHRIS THAT HE COULD SEE EVERYTHING QUITE PLAINLY AS THEIR HANDS WHICH HELD THE HIDE ROPES WERE DRAWN LOWER AND LOWER THAT'S RIGHT CAME UP IN GRIGGS HOARSE
AS HE FIRST LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT HIS CHARGES TO SEE IF THEY WERE STARTLED BY THE FIRING BUT THE PONIES DID NOT EVEN LIFT THEIR HEADS BUT WENT ON BROWSING UPON THE GREEN SHOOTS NEAR THE SPRING WHILE THE BOY INVOLUNTARILY DRAGGED HIS RIFLE ROUND
SPOILED OUR NIGHT'S REST THOUGH SAID GRIGGS DRYLY FOR THERE WAS NO SLEEP FOR FEAR OF THE REDSKINS STEALING BY US IN THE DARK AND DRIVING OFF THE CATTLE AH SAID CHRIS WITH A SIGH MY POOR MUSTANG
UGH IT WAS VERY HORRID WHEN THAT STONE GAVE WAY
PASTURAGE WAS THERE FOR THE HORSES AND MULES AND ALMOST WITHOUT EFFORT FOOD WAS TO BE HAD AT THE EXPENSE OF A FEW CARTRIDGES WHILE VERY LITTLE SKILL WAS NEEDED FOR GRIGGS AND THE BOYS TO DRAW SALMON LIKE AND TROUT LIKE FISH TO THE BANKS
TO MAKE THE BOY THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACES HE HAD EVER SEEN IN HIS LIFE WHAT A PITY HE MUTTERED AS HE LISTENED TO THE CROP CROP OF THE PONIES HE DID NOT SAY WHAT WAS A PITY
HE WAS AS EAGER TOO WHEN THE DOCTOR LED EXCURSIONS INTO GULLY AND UP HILL SIDES OF A PART OF THE WORLD THAT SEEMED TO THE ADVENTURERS AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN TRODDEN BY THE FOOT OF MAN
IN A DAY OR TWO THE PERILS AND SUFFERINGS OF THE JOURNEY ACROSS THE SALT PLAINS WERE FORGOTTEN AND CAREFUL SEARCHING FOR SIGNS OF INDIANS HAVING PROVED THAT THEY WERE THE SOLE OCCUPANTS OF THE DISTRICT
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WILL DARE TO DESCEND IN THE DAYTIME FOR THEY WILL BE AFRAID THAT WE ARE WAITING TO FIRE AT ALL WHO SHOW SO COME ON ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN WALK GRIGGS WALK SIR I SHOULD LIKE TO RUN BUT YOUR LEG MUST SMART
WHEN GRIGGS DECLARED THAT HE'D SEEN FLOCKS OF THOSE SHEEP RUNNING AWAY FROM PEOPLE STALKING THEM TILL THEY GOT TO THE EDGES OF THE PRECIPICES WHERE THEY COULD GO NO FARTHER AND THEN JUMP DOWN HEAD FIRST SO AS TO COME ON THE GREAT THICK TWISTED HORNS WHICH COVER THEIR FOREHEADS
IT'S A RISK INDEED SAID THE DOCTOR IF THE INDIANS SHOULD HAPPEN TO RIDE IN THIS DIRECTION WHERE SHOULD WE BE SHOOTING AT THEM WOULD BE THE BEST THING SAID WILTON IT'S A THOUSAND TO ONE AGAINST THEIR FINDING THE BEASTS HERE SAID GRIGGS
THEN THEY'LL RIDE BACK WITHOUT ANOTHER SHOT BEING FIRED AT THEM FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT I'M HURRYING ROUND TO JOIN YOUR PEOPLE HERE BY THE TOP WAY AND THE GULLY I SHAN'T LOSE ANY TIME AND IF I'M LUCKY I MAY GET HERE SOON ENOUGH TO JOIN YOU IN GIVING THE ENEMY A FEW BULLETS
WITHIN HALF AN HOUR FROM THESE WORDS BEING SPOKEN THE LITTLE BAGGAGE TRAIN WAS IN MOTION DIMLY SEEN BENEATH THE BAND OF STARS OVERHEAD
AND ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM CHRIS WAS ABOUT TO GO OUT INTO THE VALLEY AND SEE TO HIS PONY EXAMINING THE WOUNDS AND GIVING HIM SOMETHING A LITTLE EXTRA IN THE WAY OF FOOD
NO SIR I'VE LISTENED TILL IT HAS GIVEN ME A FEELING LIKE TOOTHACHE DO YOU THINK THEY ARE ON OUR TRAIL AH
AND WHAT FOR TO FIND GOLD WELL IT'S ONLY YELLOW METAL WE MIGHT STAY HERE AND FIND SOME OR SILVER SAID NED YES OR LEAD OR ANTIMONY OR COAL CRIED NED
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SAID CHRIS STARING NO DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF THEIR BOWS ARE OH YOU MEAN THE STRINGS MADE OUT OF TWISTED GUT PERHAPS THAT'S QUITE RIGHT MY LAD BUT NOT WHAT I MEANT I MEANT THE BOWS THEMSELVES
LOWER IT A LITTLE WHISPERED CHRIS HUSKILY AND THE WEIGHT WAS ALLOWED TO DESCEND A FEW INCHES BEING IN THE GLOOM AS IT WENT DOWN UP NOW CRIED CHRIS AGAIN
ARMS THEN I'M ALL RIGHT I TELL YOU ONLY A BIT KNOCKED ABOUT BUT WHERE'S NED
THE SHADES OF NIGHT WERE APPROACHING AS AFTER A LONG EXAMINATION OF CHRIS'S PONY THE ANIMALS WERE HEADED TOWARDS THE CAMP AND DRIVEN SLOWLY IN TOWARDS WHERE THEY WERE REGULARLY WATERED EVERY NIGHT AND SO WELL HAD ALL THE PREPARATIONS BEEN TIMED
I SAY I HOPE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE DIDN'T ALL DISAPPEAR DOWN THAT HOLE AND NEVER COME UP AGAIN IT HAS QUITE UNNERVED YOU GRIGGS SAID THE DOCTOR KINDLY I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SIR BUT IT HAS MADE ME FEEL THAT I DAREN'T GO DOWN THAT PLACE AGAIN EVEN IF IT WAS TO SAVE MY LIFE
BUT FROM WHERE WE STOOD TO DAY AFTER STALKING THOSE BIRDS I COULD SEE THE MOUNTAINS OPENING OUT IN GULCH AND RIFT AND HOLLOW BEYOND WHICH THERE WAS PEAK AND POINT AND PASS THAT LOOKED AS MUCH LIKE THE SORT OF COUNTRY AS COULD BE
HE'S SURE TO KNOW BETTER THAN I DO CRIED THE BOY AT LAST TO COMFORT HIMSELF BUT WITH VERY POOR EFFECT AS HE KEPT HIS WATCH TILL THE DARKNESS HAD SEEMED TO SETTLE DOWN LIKE A FLOOD IN THE GULCH THE PONIES HAD BECOME INVISIBLE AND THE SKY HAD TURNED TO A DARK PURPLE
HARDLY SMARTS SIR IT'S JUST AS IF SOMEBODY WAS PLAYING AT SEWING IT UP WITH A RED HOT SKEWER NICE BOLD REFRESHING SORT OF PAIN TCHAH THAT'S ALL RIGHT
WELL NATURALLY ENOUGH WHEN I SEE THE ENEMY AFTER ME I BEGIN TO RUN BUT SUPPOSE THEY DON'T ALL COME GRIGGS SAID CHRIS SHAN'T SUPPOSE ANYTHING OF THE KIND AND DON'T YOU TALK SO LOUDLY GROWLED THE AMERICAN
THOUGH ONLY A FEW MINUTES A TERRIBLY LONG TIME ALL RIGHT AT LAST SHE'S FULL NOW THEN HAUL UP
NOW THEN I WANT TO JOIN FATHER
THE WHOLE PARTY GAVE THEMSELVES UP TO THE PLEASURES OF THE PEACEFUL LIFE THEY WERE ENJOYING BUT NOT FOR LONG GRIGGS HAD ENTERED INTO THE SPIRIT OF THE CHASE THE FISHING AND THE SEARCH FOR VEGETABLE FOOD
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY WERE OR WHAT THEY DID SAID CHRIS THAT NIGHT AS THEY LAID DOWN TO SLEEP IN THE DARK BOTTOM OF THE DEPRESSION GAZING UP AT THE GREAT LUSTROUS STARS BUT I DON'T WANT ANY MORE WATER GOT LIKE THAT UGH
YEA THAT'S IT SAID CHRIS SMILING I GET VERY HUNGRY TOO IT'S ALL RIGHT I WON'T LAUGH AT YOU ANY MORE I SAY WHAT LOTS OF THOSE LITTLE GOPHERS THERE ARE HERE LOOK THERE WHY THERE MUST BE ABOUT A HUNDRED UP ON THAT PATCH OF SANDY GROUND
THEN YOU HAVEN'T BROKEN YOUR NECK NO HOW MANY LEGS ARE SNAPPED
NOT EVEN THE RISING OF THE SUN REVEALED THAT FOR WHICH A MOST ANXIOUS LOOKOUT WAS KEPT NAMELY SO MANY DARK DOTS TO INDICATE THAT THE INDIANS WERE ON THEIR TRAIL
IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT CHRIS FANCIED THAT THE FAINTNESS FROM WHICH HE SUFFERED WAS DUE TO THE WANT OF FOOD AND OPENING HIS WALLET HE TOOK OUT A PIECE OF DAMPER TO FIND THAT IT ATE VERY SWEET WITH NOTHING BUT A FEW HANDFULS OF WATER TO WASH IT DOWN
YOU HAD NO TIME TO THINK IT WAS A HUNDRED TIMES WORSE FOR US DOWN BELOW HERE INDEED SAID CHRIS HALF MOCKINGLY YES INDEED I TELL YOU MY LAD I NEVER PASSED SUCH A BAD HALF HOUR BEFORE IN MY LIFE
EVERY ONE GLARED AT THE SPEAKER AS IF WROTH WITH HIM FOR PROPOSING SO SIMPLE AND SELF EVIDENT A MEANS OF GETTING AT THE WATER AT A TIME WHEN THEY HAD ONLY SUCCEEDED AT THE RISK OF LOSING A VALUABLE LIFE BUT NO ONE SPOKE
THEY KNOW THERE ARE RIFLES AND GOOD SHOTS UP AT THE TOP YONDER AND I DARE SAY SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN HIT NOW COME ALONG THE PAIR STROLLED OUT TOWARDS WHERE THE ANIMALS WERE GRAZING
NO GOING DOWN HILL AGAIN TO BE ROASTED AND CHOKED WITH THIRST OF COURSE NOT SAID CHRIS WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT I WANT TO DO SOME OF THAT SHOOTING GRIGGS WAS TALKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT WHAT THE GOATS UP IN THE MOUNTAINS
BUT ALL AT ONCE I DODGE IN AMONG THE STONES AND BEGIN TO CLIMB UP TO THE TERRACES GET UP TO THE TOP STEP WAY IN THE SQUARE PIT AND LOOSEN OUT THE STONES THERE AFTER BLOCKING THE PLACE BELOW
POOR FATHER SAID CHRIS
WE'RE GOING TO START OFF AFRESH TO MORROW MORNING AND I SHALL BEGIN DREAMING ABOUT WHAT WE WENT THROUGH OVER YONDER POOR OLD CHAP AH YOU MAY LAUGH BUT IT'LL ALL COME BACK LIKE A NIGHTMARE WITH THE BURNING THIRST AND GIDDINESS AND THE BLACK SPOTS BEFORE ONE'S EYES
MY WORD I FELT BAD ENOUGH
EVERYTHING IS THE GOOD THEY'VE SEEN EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE BUT THEY COULDN'T THINK WITH OUR BRAINS COULD THEY MY LAD BUT WHAT COULD THEY THINK OF OUR HUNTING ABOUT AS WE DID
IMPOSSIBLE IN THIS DARKNESS THINK SO SIR WELL SUPPOSE YOU WAIT AND SEE THERE WAS SILENCE FOR AWHILE
FROM WHERE IT HAD STUCK IN THE GROUND THAT'S NOT BAD SHOOTING SAID GRIGGS COOLLY HIT HIM DOCTOR
FEEL OVERDONE SAID THE DOCTOR A LITTLE SIR WAS THE FAINT REPLY CAN YOU GIVE ME A DROP OF THE WATER THIS WAS QUICKLY OBTAINED AND THE POOR FELLOW SWALLOWED IT WITH DIFFICULTY AND THEN SEEMED TO REVIVE A LITTLE
A HINT OR A WORD OR TWO BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE PRIME MOTIVE OF THEIR JOURNEY I'M READY WHEN YOU ARE GENTLEMEN HE CRIED I DON'T SAY THIS ISN'T GRAND
THE MULES WERE LADEN WITH THE MUCH REDUCED LOADS SKEETER HAD HIS BUT HIS BELL WAS MUFFLED SO THAT IT WOULD BE PERFECTLY SILENT AND THE WATER BARRELS WERE HUNG IN POSITION ACROSS THE BACK OF THEIR REGULAR BEARER
WELL WE MUST DRINK A GREAT DEAL IN SUCH A THIRSTY LAND YES AND WE MUST EAT A DEAL TO KEEP UP ONE'S STRENGTH SAID NED I CAN'T HELP GETTING HUNGRY WHEN WE'RE WALKING ABOUT SO MUCH I SUPPOSE IT'S BECAUSE I'M GROWING FAST
THERE I DON'T THINK WE SHALL WANT TO GET OUR WATER FROM THAT PLACE AGAIN WHY NOT SAID NED SUDDENLY
BUT CAN THEY DO IT ALONE OH YES THE BRUTES ARE SAD COWARDS AND DON'T LIKE POWDER AND SHOT AT ALL THERE CRIED CHRIS
OUGHT I YES THAT YOU OUGHT THOSE FELLOWS SHOOT VERY STRAIGHT AND SEND THOSE THIN SPLINTS OF WOOD WITH TREMENDOUS FORCE THEY DO SIGHED CHRIS MY POOR MUSTANG AH
I ALMOST BELIEVE I WOULD RATHER HAVE DIED MYSELF CHRIS WAS PERFECTLY SOBERED NOW AND AS NED WALKED AWAY HE LAY THERE IN THE COOL SHADOW WITH A PECULIAR LOOK IN HIS WEARY EYES WHILE FAR FROM DESIRING SLEEP HE COULD ONLY LIE HOT HEADED AND IN FEVERISH PAIN
I DON'T WONDER THAT YOU ARE FAINT CHRIS
I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOOT ONE OF THOSE FELLOWS SAID CHRIS
WAS GIVEN IN A QUICK SHARP SHOUT IN THE DOCTOR'S FAMILIAR VOICE AH LOOK OUT HE CRIED AND FOLLOWED UP HIS WORDS BY FIRING BUT BEFORE THE BULLET LEFT HIS RIFLE CHRIS HEARD A LOUD WHIRRING AND SAW HIS COMPANION START VIOLENTLY
CRIED GRIGGS BUT LOOK ALL ROUND HERE SIR IF A GOOD STRONG PARTY OF MEN CAME HERE WITH THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEY'D MAKE THEIR OWN CIVILISATION FOR IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE CAN FIND HERE ALREADY PRETTY WELL EVERYTHING A MAN COULD WANT
HALF AN HOUR NOW PASSED AND THEN THE BOY'S AGONISED TENSION WAS BROKEN BY THREE SHOTS RINGING OUT ALMOST TOGETHER A VOLLEY HE SAID ALOUD AND THE WORDS HAD HARDLY PASSED HIS LIPS BEFORE THERE WAS A REPETITION OF THE REPORTS
THERE YOU SUCCEEDED NOW DON'T THINK ANY MORE ABOUT IT
IT OUGHT TO BE HOTTER DON'T FIND FAULT WITH NATURE SAID CHRIS DOGMATICALLY I WASN'T FINDING FAULT I ONLY SAY IT SEEMS QUEER I WANT TO THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS ASK YOUR FATHER HE KNOWS
SAY CHRIS HE ADDED WON'T THEY BE MAD AT NOT BEING ABLE TO GET OUT THEIR PONIES I SUPPOSE SO SAID CHRIS BUT THERE'S A GOOD SIDE TO EVERYTHING IT'LL BE GRAND FOR THE POOR BEASTS THEY'RE RIDDEN NEARLY TO DEATH NOW THEY'LL HAVE A GOOD REST WITH PLENTY OF FINE PASTURE
IF THEY HAVE GONE BACK HE SAID IN A LOW VOICE AS THE ADVENTUROUS PARTY SAT TOGETHER TALKING IN A LOW TONE EACH WITH HIS WEAPONS READY YES SAID WILTON IF THEY HAVE GONE BACK SUPPOSE THEY HAVE CHOSEN THIS OF ALL NIGHTS FOR AN ATTACK
AS HE ANTICIPATED ANOTHER CHECK WHEN THE PROJECTION WAS REACHED
THEN I SHALL SAY NOTHING MUCH ONLY CORONEL AND SUCH A CLEVER OH I HAVE MY IDEAS SAID CORONEL WELL I'LL BE OUT OF THE WAY SOMEWHERE I THINK I'LL GO FOR A WALK IN THE FOREST
HE PATTED HER AGAIN AS THOUGH IT WERE SHE AND NOT HIMSELF WHO WAS IN DANGER OF BREAKING DOWN MY LITTLE HYACINTH MY OWN LITTLE GIRL OH FATHER I AM GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK THERE THERE MY CHILD
HE SAT UP SUDDENLY AND STARED AT CORONEL IT WAS THAT OLD WOMAN DID IT YOU MARK MY WORDS CORONEL SHE DID IT WHY SHOULD SHE
SHE TOOK UNFLINCHING WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST SHOCK IN HER LIFE THEN PERHAPS I HAD BETTER SEE THAT EVERYTHING IS READY IN THE PALACE SHE SAID IF YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL EXCUSE ME
HOWEVER WE'LL SOON GET HIM ALL RIGHT THAT EVENING HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE COTTAGE HAD STOOD BUT IT WAS GONE NEXT MORNING HE RODE BACK TO THE WOOD UDO WAS GONE TOO
THERE WAS ANOTHER STORM OF CHEERS THE BATTLE CRY OF EURALIA HO HO MERRIWIG WAS SHOUTED FROM FIVE HUNDRED THROATS AND THE MEN DISPERSED HAPPILY TO THEIR HOMES HYACINTH AND MERRIWIG WENT INTO THE PALACE
NOW FATHER SAID HYACINTH LATER ON WHEN MERRIWIG HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHES AND REFRESHED HIMSELF YOU'VE GOT TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT'S REALLY OVER YES YES IT'S ALL OVER
EQUALLY CERTAIN WHAT THEN HAD HAPPENED THERE WAS ONLY ONE ANSWER TO HER QUESTION THE BAD WISH HAD BEEN GRANTED TO SOMEONE ELSE TO WHOM
HE MIGHT GO BACK TO ARABY
NOW WE'VE GOT IT
YES BUT OF COURSE THE CHANCE MIGHT COME AGAIN YOU'D HAVE THE THING HANGING OVER YOU ALWAYS SHE'S CLEVER YOU KNOW AND I SHOULD NEVER FEEL QUITE SAFE IF SHE WERE MY ENEMY LOVELY FLOWERS AREN'T THEY WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS ONE
NO MATTER DEAR WE CAN EASILY FIND YOU PLENTY MORE SUITORS INDEED THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN VERY NEAR MY THOUGHTS LATELY WE'LL ARRANGE A LITTLE COMPETITION AND LET THEM KNOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES THERE'LL BE NO LACK OF CANDIDATES
HERE HE TURNED AND EMBRACED HIS DAUGHTER AGAIN AND IF HIS EYE TRAVELLED OVER HER SHOULDER IN THE DIRECTION OF BELVANE'S GARDEN IT IS A SMALL MATTER AND ONE FOR WHICH THE ARCHITECT OF THE CASTLE NO DOUBT WAS PRINCIPALLY TO BLAME
TO HYACINTH HE SEEMED THE DEAREST OF FATHERS AND THE MOST WONDERFUL OF KINGS AND BY AND BY THE MOMENT CAME OF WHICH CORONEL HAD SPOKEN AND NOW SAID MERRIWIG
HE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND BEGAN TO THINK IT OUT LEFT TO HIMSELF UDO VERY SOON MADE UP HIS MIND THERE WERE THREE COURSES OPEN TO HIM HE MIGHT STAY WHERE HE WAS TILL HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
THIS HE REJECTED AT ONCE WHEN YOU HAVE THE HEAD OF A RABBIT THE TAIL OF A LION AND THE MIDDLE OF A WOOLLY LAMB THE NEED FOR ACTION OF SOME KIND IS IMPERATIVE
IT WAS MORE THAN UDO DID JUST NOW HE WAS WITH HER IN HER GARDEN TELLING HER FOR THE FIFTH TIME AN EXTRAORDINARILY DULL STORY ABOUT AN ENCOUNTER OF HIS WITH A DRAGON APPARENTLY IN ITS DOTAGE TO WHICH BELVANE WAS LISTENING WITH AN INTEREST WHICH SURPRISED EVEN THE NARRATOR
OH CORONEL YOU'RE JUST IN TIME DO TELL FATHER WHO YOU ARE CORONEL BOWED PROFOUNDLY TO THE KING BEFORE I EXPLAIN MYSELF YOUR MAJESTY HE SAID
BUTTERFLY BUT WIGGS HAD LET GO HER HAND AND WAS RUNNING BACK TO THE PALACE SHE WANTED TO BE ALONE TO THINK THIS OUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED
UDO EVIDENTLY HADN'T THOUGHT OF THIS HE TRIED TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST FRIGHTENED SHE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING
SHE WOULD FIND THAT INSPIRING
HANDICAP AGAIN I DON'T SEE ANYTHING TO LAUGH AT HE SAID STIFFLY TO INTELLIGENT PEOPLE THE OUTSIDE APPEARANCE IS NOT EVERYTHING
AND SO YOU I UNDERSTAND WISH TO MARRY MY DAUGHTER DOES THAT SURPRISE YOUR MAJESTY WELL NO IT DOESN'T AND SHE I UNDERSTAND WISHES TO MARRY YOU YES PLEASE FATHER
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO JOLLY WE CAN DO WHAT WE LIKE AND IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT DOESN'T COME OFF SO JUST FOR FUN LET'S THINK OF SOMETHING TO PAY HER OUT I FEEL I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY TO DAY ALL RIGHT WE WON'T HURT HER WE'LL HUMOUR HER
THOUGH HE WAS BEGINNING TO GUESS THAT NOBLE HANDSOME COUNTENANCE WHICH IS SO JUSTLY THE PRIDE OF ARABY
CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET HE ASKED MYSTERIOUSLY OF COURSE SAID HYACINTH DECIDING AT ONCE THAT IT WOULD NOT MATTER IF SHE ONLY TOLD CORONEL WELL THEN LISTEN
THIS IS NOT A MORAL WORK AN HOUR LATER WIGGS CAME INTO BELVANE'S GARDEN EAGER TO DISCOVER IN WHAT WAY HER INABILITY TO RHYME WOULD MANIFEST ITSELF
PRINCE CORONEL WILL BE STAYING HERE SAID THE PRINCESS PREPARE A ROOM FOR HIM AND SOME REFRESHMENT FOR US BOTH AND IF THEY DISCUSSED THOSE THINGS IN THE SERVANTS HALLS OF THOSE DAYS
PERSONALLY I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT SHE SEES IN YOU WHAT IS IT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUS SAID UDO WITH DIGNITY WELL CORONEL I THINK PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT AND THAT IT'S MY DUTY TO MARRY HER
BUT I THINK I HAVE NOTHING IN MY GARDEN AT THIS MOMENT
UDO AND I HERE SHE SQUEEZED THE HAND AND FINDING IT WAS CORONEL'S TOOK UDO'S BOLDLY WITHOUT ANY MORE MAIDENLY NONSENSE UDO AND I LOVE EACH OTHER SAY SOMETHING UDO
WHAT IS HIS INCOME A MAN MUST PROVE HIS WORTH IN SOME WAY I HAVEN'T SENT HIM AWAY AT ALL YET SHE SAID HE'S ONLY JUST COME HE'S BEEN VERY KIND TO ME AND I'M SURE YOU'LL LOVE HIM WELL WELL WE'LL ARRANGE SOMETHING FOR HIM
HE WOULD SAY THESE ARE MATTERS FOR MEN TO DISCUSS BUT HYACINTH WOULD KNOW QUITE WELL WHY SHE HAD BEEN SENT OUT AND WOULD CERTAINLY TELL CORONEL THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER AFTERWARDS IT REALLY LOOKED AS IF CORONEL WOULD HAVE TO BE LET INTO THE SECRET TOO
IT NEEDN'T NECESSARILY BE CARNATIONS HE WARNED HER I DON'T WANT TO PUT MY OPINION AGAINST ONE WHO HAS FORGIVE ME INSIDE KNOWLEDGE ON THE SUBJECT
AND NOW SAID CORONEL WE'D BETTER DECIDE WHAT TO DO BUT I DON'T MIND WHAT WE DO NOW SAID HYACINTH HAPPILY SHE MAY HAVE THE THRONE AND FATHER AND UDO AND
MAY I CONGRATULATE YOUR MAJESTY ON YOUR WONDERFUL VICTORY OVER THE BARODIANS FROM THE LITTLE I HAVE GATHERED OUTSIDE IT IS THE MOST REMARKABLE VICTORY THAT HAS EVER OCCURRED BUT OF COURSE I AM LONGING TO HEAR THE FULL STORY FROM YOUR MAJESTY'S OWN LIPS
AND HE SAW AT ONCE THAT HE KNEW A GOOD STORY WHEN HE HEARD ONE OF COURSE HE SAID YOU'LL HAVE TO WIN HER ANYTHING YOUR MAJESTY SETS ME TO DO IT'S AS WELL HE ADDED WITH A DISARMING SMILE
TO LEARN THAT ON HER DAY WIGGS COULD BE AS BAD AS ANYBODY I MEAN REALLY BAD TO TEAR YOUR FROCK TO READ BOOKS WHICH YOU OUGHT TO BE DUSTING
I SHOULD NOT RECORD IT OF HER WERE NOT ROGER SO INSISTENT NOW
GOOD BYE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
THE COUNTESS LOOKED AT HIM CRITICALLY WITH HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE NO SHE SAID THAT'S QUITE WRONG NATURALLY I'M A LITTLE OUT OF PRACTICE
MY DEAR THIS IS INDEED NEWS TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT UPON WHAT QUEST DID YOU SEND HIM HYACINTH HAD FELT THIS COMING
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT HE WAS SAVE THAT THERE WAS AN IMPRESSION OF MAGNIFICENCE ABOUT HIS PERSON SUCH MAGNIFICENCE ANYHOW AS IS GIVEN BY AN ASTRAKHAN TRIMMED FUR COAT
HE FORGOT HIS MANNERS AND MADE A JUMP TOWARDS HER SHE GLIDED GRACEFULLY BEHIND THE SUNDIAL IN A PRETTY AFFECTATION OF ALARM AND THE NEXT MOMENT
WELL THINK OF THAT UDO SHOWED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF IT BY WAVING IT PEEVISHLY THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR TACT HE SAID TELL ME WHAT I LOOK LIKE CORONEL CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT
BY THE WAY HE ADDED HENRY IS MARRYING AND SETTLING DOWN IN BARODIA IT IS CURIOUS HE WENT ON HOW AFTER A WAR ONE'S THOUGHTS TURN TO MATRIMONY HE GLANCED AT HIS DAUGHTER TO SEE HOW SHE WOULD TAKE THIS
HE ADDED BITTERLY HOW DID IT HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW CORONEL I JUST WENT TO SLEEP
WE CAN TALK QUITE WELL LIKE THIS I AM SORRY UDO SAID CORONEL MEEKLY WE SEEM TO HAVE MADE A MISTAKE BUT YOU MUST ADMIT WE FOUND YOU IN A VERY COMPROMISING POSITION IT WASN'T IN THE LEAST COMPROMISING
AND NOW SAID THE PRINCE TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE CORONEL PUT HIS ARM IN UDO'S AND WALKED HIM UP AND DOWN THE FLAGGED PATH YOUR APPROACHING MARRIAGE
HE MUST BE LONGING TO TELL YOU THAT OH HE'LL HAVE A HUNDRED THINGS TO TELL YOU FIRST BUT THEN WHEN HE SAYS AND WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING HERE WHILE I'VE BEEN AWAY NOTHING MUCH I SUPPOSE THEN YOU CAN SAY
YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOUR PRECIOUS COUNTESS WHOM YOU EXPECT ME TO MARRY HOW VERY UNKIND OF HER A NASTY PERSON TO ANNOY HE WAS SILENT FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED THOUGHTFULLY
PROMPTED CORONEL ER YES SAID UDO VERY UNWILLINGLY AND DECIDING HE WOULD EXPLAIN IT ALL AFTERWARDS WHATEVER HIS FEELINGS FOR THE COUNTESS HE WAS NOT GOING TO BE RUSHED INTO A MARRIAGE OH I'M SO GLAD
HE TOLD HER OF HIS SECRET JOURNEY TO THE KING OF BARODIA'S TENT HE TOLD HER OF THE KING OF BARODIA'S LETTER
SHE WAS THE BEST LITTLE GIRL IN EURALIA IT WILL COME THEN AS A SHOCK TO YOU AS IT DID TO ME ON THE MORNING AFTER I HAD STAGGERED HOME WITH ROGER'S SEVENTEEN VOLUMES
I THINK I'M COMING OUT WONDERING WHAT IT ALL MEANT CORONEL WAITED IN SILENCE YES I AM COMING OUT CORONEL SAID THE VOICE BUT YOU MUSTN'T BE SURPRISED IF I DON'T LOOK VERY WELL
BEWARE LEST YOU ROUSE THE LION IN ME WHERE ASKED BELVANE WITH A CHILD LIKE AIR
WIGGS HE SAID SOLEMNLY IF EVER YOU CAN DO
WAS LED INTO BELVANE'S GARDEN SHE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE FLAGGED WALK BETWEEN HER LAVENDER HEDGES AND AS HE CAME IN SHE STOPPED
I MUST ASK YOU NOT TO REFER TO IT IF I MARRY THE COUNTESS YOU'LL BE A VERY LUCKY MAN PUT IN CORONEL I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT THE KING OF EURALIA HOWEVER SHE'S CHOSEN YOU IT SEEMS
POOR LITTLE HYACINTH LEFT ALL ALONE BUT THERE SHE HAD HAD THE COUNTESS BELVANE A WOMAN OF GREAT EXPERIENCE TO HELP HER BELVANE SHOULD HE RISK IT HOW MUCH HAD SHE THOUGHT OF HIM WHILE HE WAS AWAY
OF OUR MOTHERS AND WIVES AND DAUGHTERS PROLONGED CHEERING AS THE CASE MAY BE HEAR HEAR
BUT IT CAN BE VERY FUNNY CAN'T IT SAID BELVANE COAXINGLY I WISHED FOR SOMETHING HUMOROUS TO HAPPEN TO YOU
I'M NOT IN THE LEAST FRIGHTENED BY THE COUNTESS MY DEAR UDO WHAT A SPEECH FOR A LOVER OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT AFTER ALL WHAT YOU BORE WITH SUCH PATIENCE AND DIGNITY ONCE YOU CAN BEAR AGAIN
HYACINTH WOULD BE GROWING UP AND GETTING MARRIED SOON LIFE WOULD BE LONELY IN EURALIA THEN UNLESS SHOULD HE RISK IT
BUT DIFFICULT TO BE EFFECTIVE PARTICULARLY WHEN
PROTESTED UDO INDIGNANTLY
SO FAR AS IS KNOWN THIS WAS HER ONLY WORK BUT SHE BUILT UP SOME REPUTATION ON IT AND BELVANE WHO WAS A GOOD JUDGE HAD A HIGH OPINION OF HER GENIUS TO BE EXACT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE MEN
REALLY FRANKLY HE ASKED
IT'S RATHER SERIOUS BUT IT'S RATHER NICE FATHER DEAR WOULD YOU MIND VERY MUCH IF I GOT MARRIED SOON MY DEAR YOU SHALL GET MARRIED AS SOON AS YOU LIKE LET ME SEE THERE WERE SIX OR SEVEN PRINCES WHO CAME ABOUT IT ONLY THE OTHER DAY
ALREADY THEN HE HAD SUFFERED IN HER SERVICE SO AT LEAST HE WOULD SAY AND SO POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE CORONEL HAD THOUGHT HIM FUNNY BUT WOMEN HAD NOT MUCH SENSE OF HUMOUR AS A RULE
SO YOU LIKE IT SAID MERRIWIG TRYING TO LOOK MODEST I LOVE IT I KNEW HE'D LOVE IT PUT IN HYACINTH IT'S JUST THE SORT OF STORY THAT CORONEL WOULD LOVE
CORONEL DECIDED THAT IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR TACT AH HERE YOU ARE HE SAID CHEERFULLY SHALL WE GET ALONG DON'T BE A FOOL CORONEL SAID UDO ALMOST CRYING
THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME HE BEGAN TO LOOK SO MUCH HAPPIER THAT CORONEL THOUGHT IT WAS A FAVOURABLE MOMENT IN WHICH TO WITHDRAW SHALL I GO NOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
HE SEEMED TO BE ENVYING THE KING SUCH AN ADVENTURE AN ADVENTURE AFTER HIS OWN HEART MERRIWIG WAS IN AN AWKWARD POSITION HE WONDERED FOR A MOMENT WHETHER TO ORDER HIS DAUGHTER OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVE US MY CHILD
AFTER ALL AGAIN WHY NOT MARRY THE COUNTESS IT WAS ABSURD TO SUPPOSE THERE WAS ANYTHING IN CORONEL'S NONSENSE BUT ONE NEVER KNEW NOT THAT HE WAS MARRYING HER OUT OF FEAR NO CERTAINLY NOT IT WAS SIMPLY A CHIVALROUS WHIM ON HIS PART
THERE ARE CERTAIN STATE REASONS HE SAID WITH DIGNITY WHY THAT STORY HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO GET ABOUT PARDON YOUR MAJESTY I HAVE NO WISH TO BUT AS YOU KNOW SO MUCH YOU MAY AS WELL KNOW ALL
HEROICALLY THIS WAS MORE SERIOUS HER DEAR GARDEN IN WHICH SHE COMPOSED RUINED BY THE MASTICATIONS MACHINATIONS WHAT WAS THE WORD
REALISED THAT IT WAS HER TURN AGAIN WHAT SHOULD SHE DO AN INSPIRATION CAME TO HER SHE HAD BEEN REALLY BAD THE DAY BEFORE IT WAS A PITY TO WASTE SUCH PERFECT BADNESS AS THAT
ON THE SUGGESTION OF BELVANE ONE WET AFTERNOON BUT FOR THE MOMENT THE COUNTESS WAS IN THE WAY
EXPLAINED HYACINTH AND HEARING THAT THERE WAS TO BE A WEDDING ADDED CORONEL BELVANE MADE UP HER MIND CORONEL WAS EVIDENTLY A VERY DIFFERENT MAN FROM UDO IF HE STAYED IN EURALIA AS ADVISER
WHY NOT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD CALLED FOR HIM WHAT DEVOTION IT SHOWED IF HE CAME TO HER EVEN NOW IN HIS PRESENT STATE OF BAD HEALTH SHE WAS IN TROUBLE
WE DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE KNOWN YET SHE SAID SHYLY BUT YOU HAVE GUESSED OUR SECRET YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS SHE LOOKED MODESTLY AT THE GROUND AND FEELING FOR HER RELUCTANT LOVER'S HAND WENT ON
UDO IS ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS HE TURNED AND CLAPPED THAT BEWILDERED HIGHNESS ON THE BACK AREN'T YOU UDO AND I CAN THINK OF NO ONE MORE SUITABLE IN EVERY WAY HE BOWED AGAIN AND TURNED BACK TO THE PRINCE WELL UDO YOU'RE LOOKING SPLENDID
UDO DROPPED UNDECIDEDLY INTO A SEAT THIS WANTED THINKING OUT THE COUNTESS WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER AFTER ALL AND SHE EVIDENTLY ADORED HIM OF COURSE THAT WAS NOT SURPRISING THE QUESTION WAS
HENRY SMALLNOSE A BOWMAN OF CONSIDERABLE PROMISE HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY THE ONE CASUALTY OF WAR WHILE SPYING OUT THE LAND IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE INVASION
BUT HE SOON RECOVERED HIMSELF EVEN SUPPOSING JUST FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT I AM A RABBIT I STILL HAVE SOMETHING UP MY SLEEVE I'LL COME AND
SHE HAD LENT THE RING TO NOBODY TRUE
AH WHAT A MIRACLE WORKER TRUE LOVE IS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH MADE BELVANE SO REMARKABLE WAS THAT SHE WAS NEVER AFRAID OF REMAINING SILENT WHEN SHE WAS NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO SAY
MEANWHILE UDO OF COURSE BLUNDERED ALONG GAILY WE AREN'T EXACTLY PRINCESS I MEAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE CORONEL I DIDN'T KNOW PRINCESS THAT YOU
BUT SHE WAS STILL ENGROSSED WITH THE WHISKERS
WITH MORE CONTROL OVER HER COUNTENANCE THAN THE OTHERS
HE SAID ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE STARTING WE AREN'T STARTING SAID THE VOICE WHAT'S THE MATTER WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THE BUSHES FOR WHATEVER'S THE MATTER UDO
THEN HE WAS REMINDED THAT HE MUST CRUMBLE THE BREAD AND HE WAS AWFULLY EXCITED SNATCHED UP THE BREAD AND BEGAN PULLING IT TO PIECES AND FLINGING THE MORSELS ON THE GRAVE COME FLY DOWN BIRDS FLY DOWN SPARROWS HE MUTTERED ANXIOUSLY
SAYS SHE YOU BLACK SWORD SAID I WHO ASKED YOU TO TEACH ME BUT MY BREATH SAYS SHE IS CLEAN AND YOURS IS UNCLEAN YOU ASK ALL THE OFFICERS WHETHER MY BREATH IS UNCLEAN
YET HE KNEW FROM KATERINA IVANOVNA'S WORDS THAT THE MAN HAD A FAMILY EITHER THEY ARE ALL ASLEEP OR PERHAPS THEY HAVE HEARD ME COMING AND ARE WAITING FOR ME TO OPEN THE DOOR I'D BETTER KNOCK FIRST AND HE KNOCKED
YOU CAN KEEP YOUR OWN SOCKS AND UNDERCLOTHES MITYA FLEW INTO A PASSION I WON'T HAVE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES HE SHOUTED MENACINGLY GIVE ME MY OWN IT'S IMPOSSIBLE GIVE ME MY OWN DAMN KALGANOV AND HIS CLOTHES TOO IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THEY COULD PERSUADE HIM
AND DON'T ACCUSE US OF BEING FRIGID CYNICAL SCOFFING PEOPLE WHO ARE INCAPABLE OF BELIEVING IN THE GENEROUS IMPULSES OF YOUR HEART TRY TO ENTER INTO OUR POSITION MITYA WAS INDESCRIBABLY AGITATED HE TURNED PALE VERY WELL
AND AFTER LOOKING AT THE GRAVE AND AS IT WERE SATISFYING HIMSELF THAT EVERYTHING HAD BEEN DONE AND THE BREAD HAD BEEN CRUMBLED HE SUDDENLY TO THE SURPRISE OF EVERY ONE TURNED QUITE COMPOSEDLY EVEN AND MADE HIS WAY HOMEWARDS BUT HIS STEPS BECAME MORE AND MORE HURRIED
THE POLES TOO WERE EXAMINED THOUGH THEY HAD GONE TO BED IN THEIR ROOM THEY HAD NOT SLEPT ALL NIGHT AND ON THE ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE OFFICERS THEY HASTILY DRESSED AND GOT READY REALIZING THAT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE SENT FOR
BESIDES BEING DISGUSTING AND UNWORTHY OF LOVE THEY HAVE A COMPENSATION THEY'VE EATEN THE APPLE AND KNOW GOOD AND EVIL AND THEY HAVE BECOME LIKE GODS THEY GO ON EATING IT STILL
GO AND ENJOY YOURSELF SHE SENT HIM AWAY ONCE MORE DON'T CRY I'LL CALL YOU BACK AGAIN HE WOULD RUN AWAY AND SHE LISTENED TO THE SINGING AND LOOKED AT THE DANCING THOUGH HER EYES FOLLOWED HIM WHEREVER HE WENT
YES I CONSIDER THAT I PRACTICALLY STOLE IT BUT IF YOU PREFER I APPROPRIATED IT I CONSIDER I STOLE IT AND LAST NIGHT I STOLE IT FINALLY LAST NIGHT BUT YOU SAID THAT IT'S A MONTH SINCE YOU OBTAINED IT YES BUT NOT FROM MY FATHER
IT'S ONLY YOUR TEARS I WANT EVERY ONE ELSE MAY PUNISH ME AND TRAMPLE ME UNDER FOOT EVERY ONE EVERY ONE NOT EXCEPTING ANY ONE FOR I DON'T LOVE ANY ONE DO YOU HEAR NOT ANY ONE
HE IS A CHICKEN TO YOU RAKITIN BECAUSE YOU'VE NO CONSCIENCE THAT'S WHAT IT IS YOU SEE I LOVE HIM WITH ALL MY SOUL THAT'S HOW IT IS
NONE OF HIS COMPANIONS MADE ANY REMARK UPON IT SO THAT HE HAD NO REASON TO BE EMBARRASSED BUT PERCEIVING THIS HE WAS EVEN MORE OVERCOME IT WAS STRANGE THAT THEIR ARRIVAL DID NOT SEEM EXPECTED AND THAT THEY WERE NOT RECEIVED WITH SPECIAL HONOR
I WISH IT I WISH IT AND IF HE GOES AWAY I SHALL GO TOO SHE ADDED WITH FLASHING EYES
STAY WAIT A BIT YOU WILL BE OF USE FOR I WILL TELL YOU THE SIGNS BY WHICH YOU CAN JUDGE ABOUT GORSTKIN I'VE DONE BUSINESS WITH HIM A LONG TIME YOU SEE YOU MUST WATCH HIS BEARD HE HAS A NASTY THIN RED BEARD
FYODOR PAVLOVITCH OBSERVED SARCASTICALLY ARE YOU UNEASY ABOUT YOUR SINS THEY SAY HE CAN TELL BY ONE'S EYES WHAT ONE HAS COME ABOUT AND WHAT A LOT YOU THINK OF THEIR OPINION YOU A PARISIAN AND SO ADVANCED I'M SURPRISED AT YOU
HE WHO LOVES MEN LOVES THEIR GLADNESS TOO HE WAS ALWAYS REPEATING THAT IT WAS ONE OF HIS LEADING IDEAS THERE'S NO LIVING WITHOUT JOY MITYA SAYS
HE INSTANTLY TURNED ROUND IN HIS CHAIR AND SUDDENLY LAUGHED NOT HIS ABRUPT WOODEN LAUGH BUT A LONG QUIVERING INAUDIBLE NERVOUS LAUGH WELL THERE YOU ARE AGAIN COME CHEER UP CHEER UP GRUSHENKA SAID TO HIM PERSUASIVELY
HE WILL LOOK AT ME I CAN'T YOUR EYES OUGHT TO MEET HOW WILL YOU LIVE ALL YOUR LIFE IF YOU DON'T MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DO IT NOW BETTER SUFFER ALL MY LIFE YOU OUGHT TO GO YOU OUGHT TO GO ALYOSHA REPEATED WITH MERCILESS EMPHASIS
MUTTERED MITYA AND SITTING DOWN ON THE BED HE TOOK OFF HIS SOCKS HE FELT UNBEARABLY AWKWARD ALL WERE CLOTHED WHILE HE WAS NAKED AND STRANGE TO SAY WHEN HE WAS UNDRESSED HE FELT SOMEHOW GUILTY IN THEIR PRESENCE AND WAS ALMOST READY TO BELIEVE HIMSELF
HE HIMSELF WAS FAR FROM BEING RELIGIOUS HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER PUT A PENNY CANDLE BEFORE THE IMAGE OF A SAINT
AND THERE WAS A NOTE OF FIERCE ANGER IN THE EXCLAMATION THE LITTLE PAN CRIMSON WITH FURY BUT STILL MINDFUL OF HIS DIGNITY WAS MAKING FOR THE DOOR BUT HE STOPPED SHORT AND SAID SUDDENLY ADDRESSING GRUSHENKA PANI
FOR GOD'S SAKE ALEXEY FYODOROVITCH DO IT FOR ME AND NOW NOW I AM RATHER TIRED GOOD BY SHE TURNED AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE PORTIERE SO QUICKLY
SPEAK RUSSIAN OR I WON'T LISTEN THE POLE GASPED WITH OFFENDED DIGNITY AND QUICKLY AND POMPOUSLY DELIVERED HIMSELF IN BROKEN RUSSIAN PANI AGRAFENA
BUT AT CLOSE QUARTERS IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
ONE MIGHT RETAIN A SHADOW OF NOBILITY BY DECEIVING ONESELF HAVE YOU SEEN DMITRI TO DAY NO BUT I SAW SMERDYAKOV AND ALYOSHA RAPIDLY THOUGH MINUTELY DESCRIBED HIS MEETING WITH SMERDYAKOV
THERE WAS A NOTE OF HATRED AND CONTEMPTUOUS REPULSION IN HER WORDS AND YET IT WAS SHE WHO HAD BETRAYED HIM PERHAPS BECAUSE SHE FEELS HOW SHE'S WRONGED HIM SHE HATES HIM AT MOMENTS ALYOSHA THOUGHT TO HIMSELF HE HOPED THAT IT WAS ONLY AT MOMENTS
ON PARTING FROM ALYOSHA WENT HOME TO FYODOR PAVLOVITCH'S HOUSE BUT STRANGE TO SAY HE WAS OVERCOME BY INSUFFERABLE DEPRESSION WHICH GREW GREATER AT EVERY STEP HE TOOK TOWARDS THE HOUSE THERE WAS NOTHING STRANGE IN HIS BEING DEPRESSED
I BECAME HARD HEARTED GREW STOUT GREW WISER WOULD YOU SAY NO NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD SEES IT NO ONE KNOWS IT
AND ABOVE ALL MONEY TO THE PEASANTS AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE HE WAS VERY INDIGNANT TOO AT THE PEASANT GIRLS DRINKING LIQUEUR AND EATING SWEETS THEY'RE A LOUSY LOT DMITRI FYODOROVITCH HE SAID I'D GIVE THEM A KICK EVERY ONE OF THEM AND THEY'D TAKE IT AS AN HONOR
AS ALYOSHA WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE HE BEGGED THE LANDLADY TO LOOK AFTER THOSE WHO WERE LEFT BEHIND BUT SHE INTERRUPTED HIM BEFORE HE HAD FINISHED TO BE SURE I'LL STAY WITH THEM WE ARE CHRISTIANS TOO THE OLD WOMAN WEPT AS SHE SAID IT
BUT THOU HAST KEPT THE GOOD WINE UNTIL NOW BUT WHAT'S THIS WHAT'S THIS WHY IS THE ROOM GROWING WIDER AH YES IT'S THE MARRIAGE THE WEDDING YES OF COURSE
AND SO SHORT THAT HE LOOKED AS THOUGH HE HAD GROWN OUT OF THEM LIKE A BOY I AM ALEXEY KARAMAZOV ALYOSHA BEGAN IN REPLY I QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT SIR THE GENTLEMAN SNAPPED OUT AT ONCE TO ASSURE HIM
FYODOR PAVLOVITCH FINISHED HIS TEA AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE AND LOCKED HIMSELF UP ALONE IN THE HOUSE HE WAS IN TERRIBLE EXCITEMENT AND SUSPENSE THAT EVENING HE RECKONED ON GRUSHENKA'S COMING ALMOST AS A CERTAINTY
BUT LAST YEAR I JUST MISSED A PURCHASER WHO WOULD HAVE GIVEN TWELVE THERE'S NO GETTING ANY ONE ABOUT HERE TO BUY IT THE MASLOVS HAVE IT ALL THEIR OWN WAY ONE HAS TO TAKE WHAT THEY'LL GIVE FOR NO ONE HERE DARE BID AGAINST THEM
AND SHE SHALL KNOW THIS SOUL IS NOT YET AT PEACE WITH ITSELF
BUT SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM THIS VERY JUST COMMENT QUITE SO QUITE SO CRIED IVAN WITH PECULIAR EAGERNESS OBVIOUSLY ANNOYED AT BEING INTERRUPTED
THERE IS NO MORAL DEPRAVITY NO REAL CORRUPT INNER CYNICISM IN IT BUT THERE IS THE APPEARANCE OF IT AND IT IS OFTEN LOOKED UPON AMONG THEM AS SOMETHING REFINED SUBTLE DARING AND WORTHY OF IMITATION
AND I FELT IT SO MUCH AT LAST THAT I WONDERED AT MYSELF FOR BEING SO FRIGHTENED OF A BOY I'LL GET HIM IN MY CLUTCHES AND LAUGH AT HIM I WAS FULL OF SPITE AND ANGER
AND HIS ANGER IS PASSED ANGER THE CAPTAIN REPEATED THAT'S JUST WHAT IT IS HE IS A LITTLE CREATURE BUT IT'S A MIGHTY ANGER YOU DON'T KNOW ALL SIR LET ME TELL YOU MORE
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T ACCEPT GOD YOU MUST UNDERSTAND IT'S THE WORLD CREATED BY HIM I DON'T AND CANNOT ACCEPT LET ME MAKE IT PLAIN I BELIEVE LIKE A CHILD THAT SUFFERING WILL BE HEALED AND MADE UP FOR
HE BEGINS TALKING AND I CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT HE MEANS HE CRIED LIKE THAT ONCE BEFORE AND NOW HE'S CRYING AGAIN
SO HER GUARDIAN ANGEL STOOD AND WONDERED WHAT GOOD DEED OF HERS HE COULD REMEMBER TO TELL TO GOD SHE ONCE PULLED UP AN ONION IN HER GARDEN SAID HE AND GAVE IT TO A BEGGAR WOMAN AND GOD ANSWERED
AND BEGAN GREEDILY AND PERSISTENTLY KISSING HIS DEAD BOY ON THE LIPS AT LAST THEY SUCCEEDED IN PERSUADING HIM TO COME AWAY FROM THE STEP BUT SUDDENLY HE IMPULSIVELY STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND SNATCHED A FEW FLOWERS FROM THE COFFIN
UNHAPPILY IMPOSSIBLE TO ERADICATE IN SCHOOLS BOYS PURE IN MIND AND HEART ALMOST CHILDREN ARE FOND OF TALKING IN SCHOOL AMONG THEMSELVES AND EVEN ALOUD OF THINGS PICTURES
THERE WAS SOMETHING CRAZY ABOUT HIS GESTURES AND THE WORDS THAT BROKE FROM HIM OLD MAN DEAR OLD MAN HE EXCLAIMED EVERY MINUTE GAZING AT ILUSHA
AND SO WE WILL NOT DWELL ON HOW NIKOLAY PARFENOVITCH IMPRESSED ON EVERY WITNESS CALLED THAT HE MUST GIVE HIS EVIDENCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH TRUTH AND CONSCIENCE AND THAT HE WOULD AFTERWARDS HAVE TO REPEAT HIS EVIDENCE ON OATH
I KNOW IT BY HEART FOR I AM THAT WICKED WOMAN MYSELF I BOASTED TO RAKITIN THAT I HAD GIVEN AWAY AN ONION BUT TO YOU I'LL SAY
OF MEDIUM HEIGHT WEARING A MONK'S CAP WHO OVERTOOK THEM FYODOR PAVLOVITCH AND MIUESOV STOPPED THE MONK WITH AN EXTREMELY COURTEOUS PROFOUND BOW ANNOUNCED THE FATHER SUPERIOR INVITES ALL OF YOU GENTLEMEN TO DINE WITH HIM AFTER YOUR VISIT TO THE HERMITAGE
ALYOSHA TIMIDLY OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT INTO THE ELDER'S CELL WHERE HIS COFFIN WAS NOW STANDING THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE CELL BUT FATHER PAISSY READING THE GOSPEL IN SOLITUDE OVER THE COFFIN
WELL IF SO I WON'T EITHER CHIMED IN GRUSHENKA I REALLY DON'T WANT ANY YOU CAN DRINK THE WHOLE BOTTLE ALONE RAKITIN IF ALYOSHA HAS SOME I WILL WHAT TOUCHING SENTIMENTALITY SAID RAKITIN TAUNTINGLY
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS IT THAT'S JUST WHAT'S MADE ME WRETCHED ALL MY LIFE THAT I YEARNED TO BE HONORABLE THAT I WAS SO TO SAY A MARTYR TO A SENSE OF HONOR
I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW ONE CAN LOVE ONE'S NEIGHBORS IT'S JUST ONE'S NEIGHBORS TO MY MIND THAT ONE CAN'T LOVE THOUGH ONE MIGHT LOVE THOSE AT A DISTANCE
HER PALE SALLOW FACE WAS SUDDENLY CONTORTED HER EYES BURNED YOU KNOW WHEN I READ ABOUT THAT JEW I SHOOK WITH SOBS ALL NIGHT
BE QUIET YOU STUPID LET ME SIT ON YOUR KNEE ALYOSHA LIKE THIS SHE SUDDENLY SKIPPED FORWARD AND JUMPED LAUGHING ON HIS KNEE LIKE A NESTLING KITTEN WITH HER RIGHT ARM ABOUT HIS NECK I'LL CHEER YOU UP MY PIOUS BOY
TO WORK FOR THE EMANCIPATION OF THE RUSSIAN WOMAN ON THE BANKS OF THE NEVA I WON'T SPEAK OF ILUSHA HE IS ONLY NINE I AM ALONE IN THE WORLD AND IF I DIE WHAT WILL BECOME OF ALL OF THEM I SIMPLY ASK YOU THAT
THOUGH HE NEVER SCOLDED HIM AND ALWAYS GAVE HIM A COPECK WHEN HE MET HIM SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS IN GOOD HUMOR HE WOULD SEND THE BOY SOMETHING SWEET FROM HIS TABLE BUT AS SOON AS HE HEARD OF HIS ILLNESS HE SHOWED AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN HIM
THERE THEY ARE BRINGING NEW WINE DO YOU SEE THEY ARE BRINGING THE VESSELS SOMETHING GLOWED IN ALYOSHA'S HEART SOMETHING FILLED IT TILL IT ACHED TEARS OF RAPTURE ROSE FROM HIS SOUL HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HANDS UTTERED A CRY AND WAKED UP AGAIN THE COFFIN
THERE IS SUFFERING AND SUFFERING DEGRADING HUMILIATING SUFFERING SUCH AS HUMBLES ME HUNGER FOR INSTANCE MY BENEFACTOR WILL PERHAPS ALLOW ME BUT WHEN YOU COME TO HIGHER SUFFERING FOR AN IDEA FOR INSTANCE
AND NOW AFTER FOUR YEARS THE SENSITIVE INJURED AND PATHETIC LITTLE ORPHAN HAD BECOME A PLUMP ROSY BEAUTY OF THE RUSSIAN TYPE A WOMAN OF BOLD AND DETERMINED CHARACTER PROUD AND INSOLENT
PUTTING CERTAIN INDIRECT BUT OBVIOUSLY PREMEDITATED QUESTIONS BUT WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS HE DID NOT EXPLAIN AND USUALLY AT THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT HE WOULD BREAK OFF AND RELAPSE INTO SILENCE OR PASS TO ANOTHER SUBJECT
MY AWFUL UNHAPPY CHARACTER OH YOU WILL SEE I SHALL END BY DRIVING HIM TOO TO ABANDON ME FOR ANOTHER WITH WHOM HE CAN GET ON BETTER LIKE DMITRI BUT NO I COULD NOT BEAR IT I SHOULD KILL MYSELF AND WHEN YOU CAME IN THEN
WE WILL RETURN TO THAT SUBJECT LATER SAID THE LAWYER PROMPTLY YOU WILL ALLOW US TO NOTE THAT POINT AND WRITE IT DOWN THAT YOU LOOKED UPON THAT MONEY AS YOUR OWN PROPERTY
AND HIS HEART GLOWED AND HE STRUGGLED FORWARD TOWARDS THE LIGHT AND HE LONGED TO LIVE TO LIVE TO GO ON AND ON TOWARDS THE NEW BECKONING LIGHT AND TO HASTEN HASTEN NOW AT ONCE WHAT WHERE
YET NO ONE EVER LOOKED ON HIM AS A SIMPLETON OR NAIVE PERSON THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM WHICH MADE ONE FEEL AT ONCE AND IT WAS SO ALL HIS LIFE AFTERWARDS THAT HE DID NOT CARE TO BE A JUDGE OF OTHERS
IN A FLASH HE HAD PULLED THREE GLASSES TOWARDS HIM AND FILLED THEM WITH CHAMPAGNE TO POLAND PANOVIE I DRINK TO YOUR POLAND CRIED MITYA I SHALL BE DELIGHTED PANIE SAID THE POLE ON THE SOFA WITH DIGNITY AND AFFABLE CONDESCENSION
I WANT TO DO EVIL AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ILLNESS WHY DO EVIL SO THAT EVERYTHING MIGHT BE DESTROYED AH HOW NICE IT WOULD BE IF EVERYTHING WERE DESTROYED YOU KNOW ALYOSHA
ADDRESSING ALYOSHA WITH AN APPARENTLY CALM AND EVEN VOICE AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD HAPPENED A WEEK YES I THINK IT WAS A WEEK AGO DMITRI FYODOROVITCH WAS GUILTY OF A HASTY AND UNJUST ACTION
THE FAMOUS FRENCH WRITER PIRON WE WERE ALL DRINKING THEN A BIG PARTY OF US IN A TAVERN AT THAT VERY FAIR THEY'D INVITED ME AND FIRST OF ALL I BEGAN QUOTING EPIGRAMS IS THAT YOU BOILEAU WHAT A FUNNY GET UP
A VERY UGLY ACTION THERE IS A LOW TAVERN HERE AND IN IT HE MET THAT DISCHARGED OFFICER THAT CAPTAIN WHOM YOUR FATHER USED TO EMPLOY IN SOME BUSINESS
AND BOILEAU ANSWERS THAT HE'S GOING TO A MASQUERADE THAT IS TO THE BATHS HE HE AND THEY TOOK IT TO THEMSELVES SO I MADE HASTE TO REPEAT ANOTHER VERY SARCASTIC WELL KNOWN TO ALL EDUCATED PEOPLE
I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS FEVER BUT THAT MAN IN PRISON IS INCAPABLE OF SUFFERING KATYA CONCLUDED IRRITABLY CAN SUCH A MAN SUFFER MEN LIKE HIM NEVER SUFFER
AGAINST THEM ALL FOR HIS FATHER AND FOR TRUTH AND JUSTICE FOR WHAT HE SUFFERED WHEN HE KISSED YOUR BROTHER'S HAND AND CRIED TO HIM FORGIVE FATHER FORGIVE HIM THAT ONLY GOD KNOWS AND I HIS FATHER
PERFUMES AND SUCH THINGS BUT HE SEEMED TO HAVE AS MUCH CONTEMPT FOR THE FEMALE SEX AS FOR MEN HE WAS DISCREET ALMOST UNAPPROACHABLE WITH THEM FYODOR PAVLOVITCH BEGAN TO REGARD HIM RATHER DIFFERENTLY HIS FITS WERE BECOMING MORE FREQUENT
I WAS UNFAIR TO HER SHE IS A CHRISTIAN SOUL GENTLEMEN YES I TELL YOU SHE'S A GENTLE SOUL AND NOT TO BLAME FOR ANYTHING SO WHAT AM I TO TELL HER DMITRI FYODOROVITCH WILL YOU SIT QUIET OR NOT
NO ANY OTHER WOMAN WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG BUT YOU ARE RIGHT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT BUT I SEE THAT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY GENUINE AND THEREFORE YOU ARE RIGHT
WHEN HE HAD PROTESTED SO VALIANTLY TO KATERINA IVANOVNA THAT HE WOULD GO AWAY NEXT DAY TO MOSCOW SOMETHING HAD WHISPERED IN HIS HEART THAT'S NONSENSE YOU ARE NOT GOING AND IT WON'T BE SO EASY TO TEAR YOURSELF AWAY AS YOU ARE BOASTING NOW
AND TELL HIM TOO IN MY WORDS GRUSHENKA HAS FALLEN TO A SCOUNDREL AND NOT TO YOU NOBLE HEART AND ADD TOO THAT GRUSHENKA LOVED HIM ONLY ONE HOUR ONLY ONE SHORT HOUR SHE LOVED HIM SO LET HIM REMEMBER THAT HOUR ALL HIS LIFE SAY
MY TWO DAUGHTERS AND MY SON MY LITTER IF I DIE WHO WILL CARE FOR THEM AND WHILE I LIVE WHO BUT THEY WILL CARE FOR A WRETCH LIKE ME THAT'S A GREAT THING THE LORD HAS ORDAINED FOR EVERY MAN OF MY SORT SIR
THAT MONEY WAS MY OWN MY OWN THAT IS STOLEN BY ME NOT MINE I MEAN BUT STOLEN BY ME AND IT WAS FIFTEEN HUNDRED ROUBLES AND I HAD IT ON ME ALL THE TIME ALL THE TIME BUT WHERE DID YOU GET IT I TOOK IT OFF MY NECK GENTLEMEN OFF THIS VERY NECK
THE PEASANTS AND THE DRIVER UNHESITATINGLY CONFIRMED TRIFON BORISSOVITCH'S EVIDENCE THEY NOTED DOWN WITH PARTICULAR CARE
HE ASKED MITYA TO GET INTO THE CART WITH SOMEWHAT EXCESSIVE SURLINESS WHEN I STOOD HIM DRINKS IN THE TAVERN THE MAN HAD QUITE A DIFFERENT FACE THOUGHT MITYA AS HE GOT IN AT THE GATES THERE WAS A CROWD OF PEOPLE PEASANTS WOMEN AND DRIVERS
AS THOUGH DIVINING HIS THOUGHT AND POINTING TO MAXIMOV MITYA IMMEDIATELY STARED AT KALGANOV AND THEN AT MAXIMOV HE'S TALKING NONSENSE HE LAUGHED HIS SHORT WOODEN LAUGH SEEMING SUDDENLY DELIGHTED AT SOMETHING HA HA
HE CRIED SUDDENLY WHY THE DEVIL DID I TAKE YOU UP
HE SAID AT LAST SLOWLY AND APPARENTLY ATTACHING NO SIGNIFICANCE TO HIS ANSWER I PUT YOU OFF WITH A SECONDARY REASON HE SEEMED TO SUGGEST SIMPLY TO SAY SOMETHING DAMN YOU SPEAK OUT WHAT YOU WANT
EVEN THAT EVENING AT MY LODGING BUT ENOUGH ENOUGH YOU'RE UNWORTHY EVEN TO KNOW OF THAT
I GAVE YOU A PACK AND YOU HID IT YOU PLAYED WITH MARKED CARDS I COULD SEND YOU TO SIBERIA FOR PLAYING WITH FALSE CARDS D'YOU KNOW THAT FOR IT'S JUST THE SAME AS FALSE BANKNOTES
EACH SMALLER THAN THE ONE BENEATH ON THE OTHER THERE WAS ONLY ONE VERY SMALL PILLOW THE OPPOSITE CORNER WAS SCREENED OFF BY A CURTAIN OR A SHEET HUNG ON A STRING BEHIND THIS CURTAIN COULD BE SEEN A BED
ETCETERA BUT HIS BROTHER RADIANT WITH MODEST VIRTUES COME ARINA PETROVNA COME MAMMA FIRST YOUR HAND TO BE KISSED AND HE KISSED HIS WIFE'S HAND RESPECTFULLY AND EVEN TENDERLY
WE COULD NOT BLINK AN EYE NOR LIFT A FINGER YET WE ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO THEM THAT WE RARELY THINK OF THEM AND SELDOM GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR WHAT THEY DO WITHOUT THEIR WONDER WORK TO ADJUST THE EYES WE COULD NOT SEE WITHOUT THEIR POWER THE HEART WOULD CEASE TO BEAT
IT BREAKS DOWN MORE EASILY AND MORE COMPLETELY
AND FOR THAT REASON DOES NOT FEEL AS GREAT AN URGE TO DECORATE AMPLIFY OR EVEN FURNISH THE PLACE IN WHICH HE DWELLS STEP INTO THE ROOM OF ANY LITTLE BODIED LARGE HEADED MAN AND YOU WILL BE STRUCK BY TWO FACTS
THE MUSCULARS ARE THE MOST ABANDONED IN THEIR GENEROSITY OF ALL THE TYPES THEY GO THE LIMIT FOR YOU AS THE WESTERNER SAYS AND THEY GO IT WITH THEIR MONEY TIME LOVE AND ENTHUSIASM ALL TYPES DO THIS FOR SHORT PERIODS OCCASIONALLY
MUST BE DOING SOMETHING I CAN'T BEAR TO BE DOING NOTHING YOU OFTEN HEAR PEOPLE SAY SUCH A PERSON ALWAYS HAS PLENTY OF MUSCLE
THE TYPICAL MUSCULAR HAND
FAR BELOW OR FAR ABOVE THEM
AND THE PILLAR RETURNS THE COMPLIMENT WE DO NOT LIKE ANYTHING WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND AND WE SELDOM UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THAT DIFFERS DECIDEDLY FROM OURSELVES THUS WE DISTRUST AND DISLIKE FOREIGNERS AND TO A GREATER OR LESSER EXTENT OTHER FAMILIES
WILL HIMSELF BE A HAZY MYTH AND WHEN SOCIETY IDLERS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED BETTER THAN PEOPLE WHO EARN THEIR LIVINGS THE WORLD'S PATHFINDER THE CEREBRAL THEREFORE LEADS THE WORLD IN IDEAS
WE CAN NOT SMILE SOB SPEAK NOR SING WITHOUT USING THEM WE WOULD HAVE NO PIANISTS
THE MUSCULAR IS SERIOUS IN BUSINESS NOT A JOLLIER LIKE THE ALIMENTIVE NOR A THRILLER LIKE THE THORACIC AND HE WANTS YOU TO BE THE SAME REMEMBER THE CHIEF DISTINGUISHING MARKS OF THE MUSCULAR IN THE ORDER OF THEIR IMPORTANCE ARE
CO ORDINATED HAND MACHINE TO ANY SUCH DEGREE AS THE MUSCULAR
IS OF THIS TYPE TIRES OF SAMENESS
AND IN OTHER VOCATIONS BUT THEY ARE CERTAIN TO BE PRESENT IN LARGE NUMBERS ANY DAY IN ANY OF THE ABOVE NAMED PLACES BUT WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THIS INTERESTING LITTLE EXTREME THINKER TYPE YOU MUST GO TO A LIBRARY
LEAVE HIM ALONE HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS TYPE IN BUSINESS DON'T EMPLOY THIS MAN FOR HEAVY MANUAL LABOR OR WHERE THERE IS MORE ARM WORK THAN HEAD WORK GIVE HIM MENTAL POSITIONS OR NONE IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH HIM AS A TRADESMAN
HE FEELS FROM THE FIRST MOMENT
THE KIND OF PROGRAM THAT KEEPS THE FAT MAN'S SMILE SPREAD FROM EAR TO EAR TAKES THE CEREBRAL TO THE BOX OFFICE FOR HIS MONEY A STEADY PATRON AT THE MOVIES THE CEREBRAL GOES TO THE MOVIES MORE THAN ANY OTHER TYPE SAVE THE FAT MAN
LARGE FIRM MUSCLES A SQUARE JAW AND SQUARE HANDS
TO IT THAT FATHER'S PANTS ARE OF THE KIND OF STUFF THAT WON'T WEAR OUT EASILY BUT SHE HAS THE SQUARE CREATIVE HAND THAT ENJOYS CONSTRUCTION THE PLAIN DRESSER SIMPLE DRESSES BLUE SERGE FOR INSTANCE
AND DOES NOT BELONG IN ANY STRICTLY COMMERCIAL BUSINESS REMEMBER THE CHIEF DISTINGUISHING MARKS OF THE THORACIC IN THE ORDER OF THEIR IMPORTANCE
HE WILL TAKE LITTLE INTEREST IN IT THIS TYPE DEPENDS MOSTLY UPON HIS OWN HANDS AND HEAD TO MAKE HIS FORTUNE FOR HIM AND IS SELDOM LURED INTO RISKING MONEY ON THINGS HE HAS NOT SEEN THE NATURAL EFFICIENCY EXPERT THE SHORTEST SUREST WAY
RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS IMPRACTICALITY AND DON'T TREAT HIM AS IF YOU THOUGHT MONEY WAS EVERYTHING REMEMBER THE CHIEF DISTINGUISHING MARKS OF THE CEREBRAL IN THE ORDER OF THEIR IMPORTANCE ARE THE HIGH FOREHEAD
THIS TYPE IS USUALLY SUFFICIENTLY INTELLIGENT TO KNOW THE WORLD NEEDS REFORMING AND SUFFICIENTLY CONSCIENTIOUS TO WANT TO HELP TO DO IT HE IS NOT BOUND BY TRADITIONS OR CUSTOMS AS MUCH AS OTHER TYPES BUT DOES MORE OF HIS OWN THINKING
THAT HE IS SOON READY FOR THE NEXT HE HAS FEWER COMPLEXES THAN ANY OTHER TYPE BECAUSE HE DOES NOT INHIBIT AS MUCH THE UNCORKED BOTTLE
BUT QUICK TO REWARD MERIT THE MUSCULAR DOES NOT NECESSARILY DEMAND MONEY NOR THE THINGS THAT MONEY BUYS BUT HE TRIES TO GET THE WORKABLE OUT OF LIFE THE PROPERTY OWNER THIS TYPE LIKES TO HAVE A FAIR BANK ACCOUNT AND TO GIVE HIS CHILDREN
THE THICKNESS OF HIS NECK MAY SOMETIMES GIVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT THE MUSCULAR HEAD IS SMALL
A WISE MAN IT WAS WHO SAID LET ME SEE A MAN'S SURROUNDINGS AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT HE IS THE CEREBRAL DOES NOT REALLY LIVE IN HIS HOUSE BUT IN HIS HEAD
HE CAN TALK ON ALMOST ANY SUBJECT WHEN HE WILL
IT WAS ONLY A WIGGLE AT FIRST BUT THAT WIGGLE HAS GROWN TILL TODAY IT INCLUDES EVERY KIND OF LABOR GLOBE TROTTING AND IMMIGRATION THE MUSCULAR IS FITTED WITH THE BEST TRAVELING EQUIPMENT OF ANY TYPE AND INVARIABLY LIVES A LIFE WHOSE MAIN REACTIONS EXPRESS THESE THINGS
INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER TYPES SOMETIMES POSSESS A KEEN SENSE OF HUMOR THIS TRAIT IS NOT CONFINED TO THE THORACIC BUT IT IS A SIGNIFICANT FACT THAT ALMOST EVERY HUMORIST OF NOTE
HE IS AS RESPONSIVE AS A RADIO WIRE EVERYTHING HITS THE MARK WITH HIM AND HE LETS YOU KNOW IT SO NATURALLY HE ENJOYS THE SAME FROM OTHERS AND CONSIDERS THOSE LESS EXPRESSIVE THAN HIMSELF STIFF FORMAL OR DULL
SHOULD AIM AT
THE IMPRESSION THAT HE GETS THIS KNOWLEDGE OR SUSPICION FROM THE OUTSIDE IS DUE THE SCIENTISTS SAY TO THE FACT THAT HIS THINKING HAS PROCEEDED AT SUCH LIGHTNING LIKE SPEED THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO WATCH THE WHEELS GO ROUND THE ONLY THING OF WHICH HE IS CONSCIOUS
IT MAY BE NOTHING MORE THAN HANGING THE SCREEN DOOR CHOPPING THE WOOD OR DUSTING THE FURNITURE BUT IT WILL FURNISH HIM WITH SOME KIND OF ACTIVITY BECAUSE HE ENJOYS ACTION FOR ITS OWN SAKE AND BECAUSE WORK IS ONLY APPLIED ACTION THIS TYPE MAKES THE BEST WORKER
AND THE CONSEQUENT RUNNING DOWN OF HIS BATTERIES IS A PHYSICAL PITFALL OFTEN FATAL TO THIS TYPE FAVORITE SPORTS HURDLING SPRINTING TENNIS AND ALL SPORTS
BUT NOT FOR THE SAME REASONS THE LARGE BRAINED SMALL BODIED MAN CARES NOTHING FOR MOST OF THE RECREATIONS WITH WHICH THE OTHER TYPES AMUSE THEMSELVES SO THE THEATER IS ALMOST HIS ONLY DIVERSION
THAT MAKES AN INSTANTANEOUS IMPRESSION UPON THE ONLOOKER AND GIVES HIM ONE MORE THING BY WHICH TO REMEMBER THE PERSONALITY OF THE ONE WHO LIVES THERE
OR MUSICAL COMPOSITION WHICH COULD MORE PROPERLY BE CALLED ARTISTIC ACTIVITIES
AND LEADS A PRECARIOUS EXISTENCE WORKING IN THE LIGHTER INDOOR POSITIONS REQUIRING THE LEAST MENTALITY IF YOU WILL KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN YOU WILL MANY TIMES NOTE THAT THE LITTLE WAITER IN THE HIGH CLASS RESTAURANT OR HOTEL HAS A HEAD VERY LARGE FOR HIS BODY
GETTING THINGS DONE THAT HE IS LIKELY TO FORGET
FOOTBALL BASEBALL HANDBALL TENNIS ROWING AND PUGILISM ARE HIS PREFERENCES ALL EXPERTS IN THESE LINES ARE LARGELY MUSCULAR PHYSICAL ASSETS HIS WONDERFUL MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT UPON WHICH DEPENDS SO MUCH OF LIFE'S HAPPINESS
PEOPLE WHO LET OTHERS DO THEIR THINKING FOR THEM AND THOSE WHO ARE NOT AWARE OF THE GREAT THINGS GOING ON IN WORLD MOVEMENTS ARE NOT POPULAR WITH THIS TYPE HE SOMETIMES HAS A SECRET CONTEMPT FOR THEM
AND ARE MUCH BROADER IN PROPORTION TO HIS HEIGHT THE ALIMENTIVE HAS SLOPING SHOULDERS AND THE THORACIC INCLINES TO HIGH SHOULDERS
BUT DEMANDS THE THINGS EVERYDAY MEN OR WOMEN NEED FOR EVERYDAY EXISTENCE
A BOX LIKE APPEARANCE IT IS CONSIDERED BECOMING TO MEN
TO THOSE PARTS OF THE ORGANISM NOT TOUCHED BY THE STOMACH FOR THE PURPOSE OF REACHING THESE SUBURBS THERE WAS INVOLVED THE CIRCULATORY OR THORACIC SYSTEM AND THIS GAVE RISE AS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER TO THE THORACIC TYPE
A CEREBRAL PROFESSOR WHOM WE KNOW SOMETIMES APPEARED BEFORE HIS HARVARD CLASSES IN BEDROOM SLIPPERS A THORACIC WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO LET HIS OWN BROTHER CATCH HIM IN HIS WRITES BETTER THAN HE TALKS
HE IS THEREFORE A MAN WHO LIKES HARMONY AVOIDS COMING TO BLOWS AND GOES OUT OF HIS WAY TO KEEP THE PEACE SUCH A MAN DOES NOT GO HUNTING AND SELDOM OWNS A GUN HE DISLIKES TO KILL OR HARM ANY CREATURE
SOCIAL ASSETS
SOCIAL ASSETS
NOTE THE EXTREMELY MUSCULAR FACE AND JAW COMBAT OR PERSONAL FIGHTING IS A MATTER OF MUSCLE ACTION BEING WELL EQUIPPED FOR IT THIS TYPE ACTUALLY ENJOYS IT THAT IS WHY HE IS OFTENER IN TROUBLE THAN ANY OTHER TYPE IT WAS NO ACCIDENT THAT THE PHRASE
FOR THE ACTIVITY'S SAKE WORK PALLS ON THE ALIMENTIVE AND MONOTONY ON THE THORACIC BUT LEISURE IS WHAT PALLS ON THE MUSCULAR HE MAY HAVE WORKED TEN YEARS WITHOUT A VACATION AND HE MAY IMAGINE HE WANTS A LONG ONE
HE IS IN DANGER OF APOPLEXY THE COMBINATION OF EXTREME THORACIC AND EXTREME ALIMENTIVE TENDENCIES IS THE CAUSE OF THIS DISEASE LIKES FANCY FOODS VARIETY AND NOVELTY IN FOOD
THEIR SIZE SHAPE AND STRUCTURE AS SEEN FROM THE BACK OF THE HAND ARE ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT AND TELL US MUCH MORE ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL'S NATURE THAN THE PALM DOES PERHAPS YOU HAVE THOUGHT THAT A HAND WAS JUST A HAND BUT THERE ARE HANDS AND HANDS
WITH GIFTED HEAD WORK WITHOUT A SURE STRONG WELL KNIT HAND
WHEREAS THE FAT MAN WHEN FURNISHING A HOME DEVOTES HIS ATTENTION TO SOFT BEDS STEAM HEAT AND PLENTY OF CUSHIONED DIVANS THE THORACIC THINKS OF THE CHANDELIERS THE UNUSUAL CHAIRS THE PRETTY FRONT DOORSTEP THE LANDSCAPE GARDENING AND THE COLOR SCHEMES
BECAUSE WE ARE PRONE TO ADVISE OTHERS TO DO WHAT WE ENJOY DOING OURSELVES IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT SO STRENUOUS A MAN AS T R SHOULD ADVOCATE WHOLESALE UNIVERSAL AND ALMOST COMPULSORY STRENUOSITY
BOOKS AND STORIES THAT ARE ROMANTIC ADVENTUROUS AND DIFFERENT ARE THE FAVORITES OF THIS TYPE DETECTIVE STORIES ARE OFTEN IN HIGH FAVOR WITH HIM ALSO PHYSICAL ASSETS
HE HAS A BETTER NATURAL START IN HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS THAN ANY OTHER TYPE SOCIAL LIABILITIES QUICK TEMPER HIS INFLAMMABLE NATURE AND APPEARANCES OF VANITY ARE HIS GREATEST SOCIAL LIABILITIES
WE WILL GIVE LESS OF BOTH TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE OF BOTH TO THE CREATOR TYPE VS TRAINING THE MOST THAT TRAINING CAN DO IS TO BRACE UP THE WEAK SPOTS IN US TO CULTIVATE THE STRONG ONES
ALL THE OTHER TYPES HAVE DECIDED PREFERENCES AS TO THEIR CLOTHES THE ALIMENTIVE DEMANDS COMFORT THE THORACIC STYLE THE MUSCULAR DURABILITY AND THE OSSEOUS SAMENESS BUT THE EXTREME CEREBRAL TYPE SAYS ANYTHING WILL DO
HE DOES NOT DEMAND SUCH EASY TO WEAR GARMENTS AS THE FAT MAN ON THE CONTRARY HE WILL UNDERGO EXTREME DISCOMFORT IF IT GIVES HIM A DISTINCTIVE APPEARANCE HE WANTS HIS HOUSE TO BE ELEGANT THE GROUNDS DIFFERENT
SNUBS THE SNOBS THE SNOB IS DISLIKED BY EVERY ONE BUT IS THE ESPECIAL AVERSION OF THIS TYPE
THE HAND OF THE CREATIVE ARTIST THE ARTIST'S HAND AND THE ARTISTIC HAND ARE PHRASES LONG USED BUT MISUSED DELICATE TAPERING FINGERS WERE SUPPOSED IN ANCIENT TIMES TO DENOTE ARTISTIC ABILITY
THE PHYSICAL ADVANTAGES OF THIS TYPE ARE HIS QUICK ENERGY BASED ON HIS WONDERFUL BREATHING SYSTEM
THE SOCIAL NONCONFORMIST
AND SINCE EACH TYPE POSSESSES ABOUT AS MANY WEAKNESSES AS THE OTHERS IT FOLLOWS THAT NO TYPE IS SUPERIOR MORALLY TO ANY OTHER AND NO TYPE IS MORALLY INFERIOR TO ANY OTHER TYPE AND TEMPTATION MORALITY IS MOSTLY A MATTER OF HOW MUCH TEMPTATION YOU CAN WITHSTAND
IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER TYPES TAKING PART PLEASE OBSERVE THAT THEY ARE SECONDARY TO THE ACROBATS THEY CATCH THE HANDKERCHIEFS OR OTHERWISE ACT AS FOILS FOR THE REAL PERFORMERS ALL THE HARD WORK IN THE ACT WILL BE DONE BY MUSCULARS
HIS PUGNACITY IS ALSO A SEVERE DRAWBACK EMOTIONAL ASSETS UNDERSTANDING ENTHUSIASM AND WARMTH OF HEART
DO YOU GOOD BUT THE REAL REASON USUALLY IS THAT WE LIKE TO DO IT OURSELVES THE ACROBATIC TYPE THE NEXT TIME YOU GO TO A VAUDEVILLE SHOW
THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE ARE THINGS THIS TYPE DEMANDS AND GETS WHEREAS THE ALIMENTIVE DEMANDS THE COMFORTS AND THE THORACIC THE UNUSUAL
NOR TO ADVENTURE SO MUCH AS THE THORACIC BUT STICKS TO PRACTICAL SUBJECTS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY
TO CONFINE HIMSELF TO A VEGETABLE DIET WHEN HE IS IN MODERATE CIRCUMSTANCES
IS LESS SUGGESTIBLE IS LESS TRACTABLE THAN THE ALIMENTIVE OR THORACIC BUT IS LESS LIKELY TO REVERT AFTERWARDS BUILT ON THE SQUARE ON THE SQUARE IS A FIGURATIVE EXPRESSION USUALLY APPLYING TO A MORAL TENDENCY IN THIS SENSE
HIS SQUARE FACE
A CONSTANT STREAM OF TALK MUST HAVE BEEN FIRST SAID IN DESCRIBING THIS TYPE
HE IS LIKELY TO TELL NOT ONLY HIS FAMILY BUT HIS NEWEST ACQUAINTANCES JUST WHAT HE IS PLANNING TO DO AND HOW HE EXPECTS TO DO IT THE NATURALLY SECRETIVE PERSON
HE IS SOON DEVOURING BOOKS FOR OLDER HEADS WHY WON'T HE RUN AND PLAY LIKE OTHER CHILDREN WAILS MOTHER AND THAT BOY OUGHT TO BE MADE TO JOIN THE BALL TEAM SCOLDS FATHER BUT THAT BOY CONTINUES TO KEEP HIS NOSE IN A BOOK
DON'T FORGET TO PRAISE HIM WHEN DESERVED AND DON'T PIN HIM DOWN TO ROUTINE THIS TYPE SUCCEEDS BEST IN PROFESSIONS
THE THORACIC FINDS IT HARD TO MAINTAIN A GRUDGE BECAUSE HE GETS OVER IT JUST AS HE GETS OVER EVERYTHING ELSE
PRODUCED BY HIS WONDERFUL HEART SYSTEM HE IS NOTED FOR HIS ABILITY TO GET HIS SECOND WIND AND HAS REMARKABLE CAPACITY FOR RISING TO SUDDEN PHYSICAL EMERGENCIES PHYSICAL LIABILITIES A TENDENCY TO OVER EXCITEMENT
THE PLUTOCRATS WHEN HE FURTHERS THE CAUSES OF THE PROLETARIAT
TOO GREAT RESERVE AND TOO MUCH ABSTRACTNESS IN CONVERSATION ARE THE THINGS THAT HANDICAP THE CEREBRAL HIS SMALL STATURE AND TIMID AIR ALSO ADD TO HIS APPEARANCE OF INSIGNIFICANCE AND CAUSE HIM TO BE OVERLOOKED AT SOCIAL AFFAIRS EMOTIONAL ASSETS
SUCH MEN ARE MUCH BETTER READ HAVE A FAR GREATER APPRECIATION OF ART AND LITERATURE AND MORE NATURAL REFINEMENT THAN THE PORKY PATRONS THEY SERVE SOCIAL ASSETS
THE POOR TALKER SOMETIMES SURPRISES US BY BEING A GOOD WRITER SUCH A ONE IS USUALLY OF THE CEREBRAL TYPE HE LIKES TO THINK OUT EVERY PHASE OF A THING AND PUT IT INTO JUST THE RIGHT WORDS BEFORE GIVING IT TO THE WORLD
AND FINDS LIKE THE BOY RECOVERING FROM THE CHICKENPOX THAT HE SIMPLY HASN'T IT ANY MORE DISEASES HE IS MOST SUSCEPTIBLE TO ACUTE DISEASES ARE THE ONES CHIEFLY AFFECTING THIS TYPE
UP AND DOING ACCOMPLISHING SOMETHING IF THERE IS NOTHING NEAR THEM THAT NEEDS DOING THEY ARE SURE TO GO AND FIND SOMETHING THE BORN WORKER WORK IS SECOND NATURE TO THIS TYPE HE REALLY PREFERS IT EVERYONE LIKES SOME KIND OF WORK WHEN IN THE MOOD
THIS SYSTEM CONSISTS OF THE MUSCLES OF THE ORGANISM
INSTEAD OF MERELY THINKING THE MOST PRACTICAL TYPE
THE CLEVEREST CROOKS THOSE WHO DEFY DETECTION FOR YEARS ALWAYS HAVE A LARGE ELEMENT OF THE CEREBRAL IN THEIR MAKEUP BIG BRAINS IN LITTLE JOBS
IN THE PURE MUSCULAR TYPE HIS MUSCLES ARE FIRM AND LARGE SUCH MUSCLES CAN NOT BE DISGUISED BUT SEEM TO STAND OUT ALL OVER HIM HELPLESS WITHOUT THEM WITHOUT THEM WE WOULD BE HELPLESS MASSES OF FAT AND BONE
WE REPEAT HE IS NO MORE SQUARE MORALLY THAN ANY OTHER TYPE
THIS ENTHUSIASM LITERALLY BURNS HIS WAY TO THE THINGS HE WANTS THE PLAIN TALKER WHEN DEEPLY MOVED THIS TYPE TALKS WELL IF THE MENTAL ELEMENT IS ALSO STRONG HE CAN BECOME A GOOD PUBLIC SPEAKER FOR HE WILL
AND PROCEEDS TO RUN THEM OFF FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT
HE WILL GO AWAY FROM HIS ROOM LEAVING EVERY CENT HE OWNS LYING ON THE DRESSER AND THEN FORGET TO LOCK THE DOOR THIS TYPE OF PERSON ALMOST NEVER ASKS FOR A RAISE HE IS TOO BUSY DREAMING DREAMS TO PLAN WHAT HE WILL DO IN HIS OLD AGE
AND HIS LACK OF RETICENCE IN GIVING THE INTIMATE AND INTERESTING DETAILS ARE OTHER TRAITS WHICH HELP TO MAKE THE THORACIC A LIVELY COMPANION THE LURE OF SPONTANEITY THE MOST BELOVED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE THE SPONTANEOUS
IS WHAT THIS TYPE ASKS FOR WHEN HE DROPS IN TO BUY A SUIT MUSCULARS ARE NOT PARSIMONIOUS NOR STINGY THEIR BUYING THE MOST DURABLE IN EVERYTHING IS NOT SO MUCH TO SAVE MONEY AS FOR THE PURPOSE OF HAVING SOMETHING THEY DO NOT NEED TO BE AFRAID TO HANDLE LIKES HEAVY MATERIALS
THE MUSCLE SYSTEM OF THE HUMAN BODY IS SIMPLY A CO ORDINATED ORGANIZED ARRANGEMENT OF LAYERS OF LEAN MEAT OF WHICH EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS A COMPLETE SET AN INDIVIDUAL'S MUSCLES MAY BE SMALL FLABBY DEFICIENT IN STRENGTH OR SO THIN AS TO BE ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE
YOU HAVE KNOWN WERE NOT TALL MEN BUT MEDIUM OR BELOW MEDIUM IN HEIGHT
IS NOW AGREED BY PSYCHOLOGISTS THE THING WE HAVE CALLED INTUITION THEY MAINTAIN IS NOT DUE TO IRREGULAR OR SUPERNATURAL CAUSES BUT TO OUR OWN NORMAL NATURAL MENTAL PROCESSES
SHE TOLD US THAT SHE USED TO SEND HER CEREBRAL HUBBY ACROSS THE STREET FOR THE LOAF OF BREAD THAT WAS FOUND LACKING JUST AS THEY WERE READY TO SIT DOWN TO DINNER ONLY TO WAIT HOURS AND THEN HAVE HIM COME BACK WITH A BOOK UNDER HIS ARM NO BREAD AND NO REALIZATION OF HOW LONG HE HAD BEEN GONE
LIKES DASH THE THORACIC WANTS EVERYTHING HE WEARS DRIVES LIVES IN OR OWNS TO GET ACROSS TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION THE FAT MAN LOVES COMFORT ABOVE ALL ELSE BUT THE FLORID MAN LOVES DISTINCTION
HAVING DECIDED WHICH TYPE PREDOMINATES AND WHICH IS SECOND IN HIM THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS COMBINATION IS MADE CLEAR TO YOU BY THE FOLLOWING LAW LAW OF COMBINATION THE TYPE
AND THE MEDICAL MAN OF MONSEIGNEUR DECLARED IT IN A PROCES VERBAL THAT THE TWO SLAVES COULD NOT HAVE LIVED EIGHT DAYS LONGER IN THIS FRIGHTFUL DUNGEON IT REQUIRED THE GREATEST POSSIBLE CARE TO SNATCH DAVID AND CECILY FROM ALMOST CERTAIN DEATH
HE REFUSED HE DID HE SAID HE HAD AN INCLINATION FOR THE GIRL HIMSELF THAT IN HIS LIFE BEFORE HE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED THE REPULSE OF A SLAVE HE MEANT TO POSSESS HER AND HE WOULD
BUT YOU SEE THERE ARE LUCKY AND UNLUCKY PEOPLE AND WHEN I THINK THAT I AM GOING TO GAIN FOUR FRANCS A DAY AND KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE WHO ONLY EARN THE HALF OR EVEN LESS WILL YOU COME UP AND SEE THE REST OF THE HOUSE
WHAT THE DEVIL ONE DOES NOT OPEN A DOOR WITH ONE'S BACK AT ALL EVENTS BARON THE COURIER THE COURIER SAID MURPHY POINTING TO THE CLOCK
I WHO NEVER EARNED BUT TWO AND THAT ALL AT ONCE
FROM THIS PERIOD DAVID HAS BEEN ATTACHED TO THE SUITE OF MONSEIGNEUR AS A MEDICAL MAN AND IS MOST DEVOTEDLY ATTACHED TO HIM DAVID MARRIED CECILY OF COURSE ON ARRIVING IN EUROPE THIS MARRIAGE
WAS A METISSE ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE NAMED CECILY AND FOR THIS POOR GIRL MISTER WILLIS TOOK A FANCY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HIS ADVANCES WERE REPULSED AND OBSTINATELY RESISTED CECILY WAS IN LOVE
THE HISTORY OF DAVID AND CECILY I FORGOT TO SAY THAT AFTER HAVING MALTREATED THE GIRL HE HAD THROWN HER INTO A DUNGEON ALSO AS A PUNISHMENT FOR HER DISDAIN OF HIM HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS ON HEARING WILLIS'S FEARFUL NARRATION
I HAVE THE HONOUR TO FULFIL THE FUNCTIONS OF CHAMBERLAIN AND AIDE DE CAMP
QUITE READY TO MEET BORES AND DEFY THEM JUST AS THE ROMAN SOLDIER WHO BEFORE A FORCED MARCH USED TO SOLE HIS SANDALS WITH LEAD AND SO FOUND ALL FATIGUE LIGHT BY LEAVING THEM OFF I NOW DISCOVER THE USEFULNESS OF THE COLONEL
NO GREAT DEAL OF CARE OR TROUBLE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE LONG DISTANCE AND THE DIFFICULTY IN PROCURING ANY MEANS OF CONVEYANCE DESIROUS OF REMEDYING SO EXTREME AN INCONVENIENCE IN A COUNTRY SUBJECT TO VIOLENT EPIDEMICS
I MEAN TO SAY WELL WHAT THAT I AM A CONVICT WHO HAS SERVED HIS TIME
AND THAT IT CANNOT LAST I WOULD RATHER SLEEP ALL MY LIFE ON THE WRETCHED STRAW BED IN MY COCK LOFT THAN SLEEP FIVE OR SIX NIGHTS ONLY IN A GOOD BED THAT'S MY VIEW OF THE THING AND YOU ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIAR IN YOUR VIEW
FOR FEAR OF AROUSING THE GRAND DUKE'S SUSPICIONS AS HE WOULD BE INEXORABLE AND DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR ONLY HAPPINESS THAT OF SEEING EACH OTHER EVERY DAY THE YOUNG PRINCE PROMISED TO BE CAUTIOUS AND CONCEAL HIS LOVE THE SCOTCH MAIDEN WAS TOO AMBITIOUS
OF THE GRAND DUKE AT A CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN DIET THE PROPHECY OF THE SCOTCH SOOTHSAYER WAS FULFILLED SARAH WEDDED THE HEIR TO A THRONE WITHOUT QUENCHING THE FIRE OF HIS LOVE
THESE UNFORTUNATE CREATURES EVINCED THEIR INDIGNATION OR RATHER GRIEF MOST POWERFULLY WHEN THEY SAW DAVID LACERATED BY THE WHIP MISTER WILLIS DEEPLY EXASPERATED AFFECTED TO DISCOVER IN THIS MANIFESTATION THE APPEARANCE OF REVOLT
FOR HE MUST AFTER THAT HAVE REQUIRED THE MAN'S SERVICES PRECISELY SO FOR THAT VERY DAY THE VERY FURY INTO WHICH HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF JOINED TO THE DRUNKENNESS IN WHICH THE BRUTE INDULGED EVERY EVENING
THIS CONDUCT SEEMS LESS STUPID BUT QUITE AS FEROCIOUS A SHORT TIME AFTER THESE EVENTS WE ARRIVED IN AMERICA MONSEIGNEUR HAD FREIGHTED A DANISH BRIG AT SAINT THOMAS'S AND WE VISITED INCOGNITO ALL THE SETTLEMENTS OF THE AMERICAN COAST
I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT TWAS THE PAY OF AN ADJUTANT SUB OFFICER I REPLIED
BUT SOON RESTORED THROUGH THE CAREFUL ATTENTIONS AND EFFICACIOUS REMEDIES OF DAVID OUT OF THIRTY NEGROES DANGEROUSLY AFFECTED BY THIS FATAL DISEASE ONLY TWO PERISHED MISTER WILLIS
AND WHO DID NOT ARRIVE UNTIL THE SECOND DAY AND WHEN RESTORED TO HEALTH AT LAST THE COLONIST NOT DESIRING TO BLUSH BEFORE HIS OWN SLAVE WHOSE PRESENCE CONSTANTLY OPPRESSED HIM WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS EXCESSIVE NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT
AT THE MALEVOLENCE OF THESE REMARKS SHE SHRUGGED HER SHOULDERS AND SAID ALOUD FROM THE END OF THE SALOON IN WHICH SHE WAS SITTING MY DEAR SARAH COME HERE SARAH ROSE IT WAS
AND SHE IN DEEP DESPAIR SOUGHT DAVID AND TOLD HIM ALL THE BRUTAL ATTEMPTS THAT SHE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO AND WITH DIFFICULTY ESCAPED THE BLACK COMFORTED HER AND INSTANTLY WENT TO MISTER WILLIS TO REQUEST HER HAND IN MARRIAGE
IT WAS THEN THAT THIS WOMAN EVINCED ALL THOSE EXACTIONS WHICH WERE SO NEW TO AND SO MUCH ASTONISHED RODOLPH SHE PROTESTED WITH HYPOCRITICAL TEARS STREAMING FROM HER EYES
AND THEN IN THE MORNING IN THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE TO SEIZE AN OX BY THE HORNS PARTICULARLY WHEN HE'S FIERCE NOM DE NOM HE MUST BE FIERCE THEN TO PUT ON THE RING TO CLEAVE HIM DOWN CUT HIM UP
SO MAGNIFICENTLY VARIEGATED AND AS SUCH PORTRAYING THE THEATRICAL AND PUERILE PHASE OF SOVEREIGN POWER HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FEELS THE MORE SENSIBLY THE VANITY OF THOSE BARREN POMPS AND GLORIES OF THE WORLD
I OPPOSE A VIOLENCE THAT SAVES GOD WILL JUDGE BETWEEN US WE THEN RETREATED LEAVING MISTER WILLIS STUPEFIED MOTIONLESS AND BELIEVING HIMSELF UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A DREAM
DRUNK WITH WINE AND FEROCITY YOU WOULD COMPREHEND HOW MONSEIGNEUR DESIRED AS HE SAID ON THIS OCCASION TO ACT AS IT WERE IN BEHALF OF PROVIDENCE
AND WHEN HE CONSIDERED THE INFLUENCE WHICH DAVID HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE SLAVES HE BELIEVED HIM CAPABLE OF PLACING HIMSELF AT THE HEAD OF A REBELLION TO AVENGE HIMSELF OF HIS WRONGS THIS FEAR WAS ANOTHER MOTIVE WITH THE COLONIST
TO RETURN HOME TO ONE'S OWN FIRESIDE TO WARM YOURSELF IF COLD OR DRY YOURSELF IF WET TO FIND YOUR HOUSEKEEPER OR A GOOD JOLLY PLUMP WIFE CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT WITH A PARCEL OF CHILDREN TO FEEL IN YOUR POCKETS
AN AFFECTION THAT HIS PATERNAL ANGER WOULD GRADUALLY SUBSIDE AND SHE WOULD AT LAST TAKE IN THE COURT OF GEROLSTEIN THE RANK WHICH WAS DUE TO HER SHE MIGHT SAY IN A DOUBLE SENSE BECAUSE SHE WAS ABOUT
VIOLENTLY EXCITED BY CONSTRAINT AND THE SKILFUL MANAGEMENT OF SARAH WHO PRETENDED TO FEEL STILL MORE THAN HE DID THE INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES
WHO WITH A MERRY FACE AND ACTIVE HANDS WAS VERY BUSY IN COMPLETING THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE SHOP
HORRIBLE BUT BY NO MEANS ASTONISHING DAVID MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE EYES OF HIS BRUTAL MASTER A COMPLETE LIVING REMORSE SUCH CONDUCT WAS DICTATED ALIKE BY REVENGE AND JEALOUSY
WHO HAVE ASSUMED THEIR PRETENDED MISSIONS WITH SO SERIOUS AN AIR TO TELL THE TRUTH I HAVE NEVER CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD WHY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS ATTACHED THE COLONEL AND THE COUNT TO HIS PRIVATE PERSON
I WAS AS SMART AS A LANDLORD OR A DENTIST YOU APPOINTED ME TO MEET YOU THIS MORNING
WOULD NO LONGER CONCEAL FOR HER PREGNANCY MIGHT HAVE BEEN HIDDEN LONGER HAD SHE BUT HAVE CHOSEN BUT THE AMBITIOUS WOMAN HAD SOUGHT THIS DISPLAY IN ORDER TO COMPEL RODOLPH TO DECLARE HIS MARRIAGE
THE WAY WAS LONG AND THE COLD EXCESSIVE WERE THEY NOT
FOR HE HAD BOUGHT THE PROPERTY THROUGH AN AGENT AT THIS MOMENT TWO PERSONS WHO HAD COME FROM PARIS IN A CABRIOLET ALIGHTED AT THE DOOR OF THE SHOP THE ONE WAS MURPHY QUITE CURED OF HIS WOUND
TO THE EXTREME GRATIFICATION OF THE BLACK DOCTOR WHOSE FELLOWS REGARDED HIM AS A DIVINITY AMONGST THEM FOR HE HAD WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY IT IS TRUE OBTAINED FROM THEIR MASTER SOME FEW INDULGENCES AND WAS HOPING TO PROCURE STILL MORE
SHE SOON TOLD HIM THAT SHE SHARED HIS LOVE
HAD TAKEN HER AWAY FROM THERE
DAVID BREATHED THE LANGUAGE AND THE HOPE OF A FREE AND HAPPY IMMORTALITY
WHEN THE KEYS OF OFFICE ARE SUSPENDED FROM HIS SHOULDERS APROPOS BARON MONSEIGNEUR DECLARES THAT THE SHOULDERS OF A CHAMBERLAIN HAVE A PECULIAR PHYSIOGNOMY
SEYTON SIDED WITH HIS SISTER THE MARRIAGE IS INDISSOLUBLE SAID HE TO HIS ROYAL BROTHER IN LAW THE GRAND DUKE MAY EXILE YOU FROM HIS COURT YOU AND YOUR WIFE NOTHING MORE
HE WATCHED AND TENDED HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN HIS FATHER COUNTERACTING THE DISEASE STEP BY STEP WITH GREAT SKILL AND PERFECT KNOWLEDGE UNTIL AT LAST HE SUCCEEDED IN DEFEATING IT TO THE EXTREME SURPRISE OF THE DOCTOR WHO HAD BEEN SENT FOR
HIS FOREFINGER POINTED TO THE ROOF AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE COLONIST SAID IN A SOLEMN TONE GOD AND THEN WAS SILENT GOD REPLIED THE PLANTER BURSTING INTO A LOUD FIT OF LAUGHTER TELL HIM THEN
PERFIDIOUS ENEMY COULD NOT HAVE DEVISED A BETTER PLAN THAN THAT SUGGESTED BY THE WORTHY PRINCESS IN HER DESIRE TO DEFEND HER PROTEGEE SARAH CAME TOWARDS HER
AND DANGERS APPEARED IMPOSSIBLE TO POLIDORI AND HE FRANKLY TOLD SEYTON THE REASONS WHY THE GRAND DUKE WOULD NEVER SUBMIT TO SUCH A UNION SEYTON AGREED IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REASONS BUT PROPOSED
BUT WHICH I OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL FROM THE MASTER WHO EMPLOYS ME BECAUSE IF HE IS OFFENDED BY IT WHY THEN YOU SEE WHY AFTERWARDS WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO SAY
I FOUND YOU THERE IN A CAB AND HERE WE ARE WELL DO YOU FIND ANYTHING TO REGRET IN ALL THIS
TO THOSE UNHAPPY WRETCHES WHO CONTRARY TO OTHER MEN COUNT WITH BITTER JOY THE HOURS WHICH BRING THEM NEARER TO THE TOMB TO THOSE UNFORTUNATE CREATURES WHO LOOKED FORWARD ONLY TO NOTHINGNESS HEREAFTER
HER MATERNITY WAS ONLY WITH HER A MEANS OF ACTING MORE EFFECTUALLY ON RODOLPH AND HAD NO SOFTENING EFFECT ON HER IRON SOUL THE YOUTH HEADLONG LOVE AND
THOSE WORDS CHEERED ME UP AGAIN DIRECTLY TONNERRE I I SHALL NEVER FORGET HIM HE TOLD ME I HAD HEART AND HONOUR THAT'S ENOUGH UNFORTUNATELY MY LAD
FOR A BUTCHER IN THAT TOWN AND WHICH WERE EXACTLY OPPOSITE TO THE CHURCH ONE OF THOSE IDLERS MORE INQUISITIVE THAN HIS COMPANIONS WENT AND ASKED THE BUTCHER BOY
POOR CHILD SHE NEVER LIKED TO DO WRONG SHE WAS SO YOUNG AND THEN THE HABIT
WHICH ALTHOUGH SECRET SHOULD BE LEGAL AND ONLY AVOWED AFTER THE DECEASE OF THE GRAND DUKE SARAH WAS OF A NOBLE AND ANCIENT HOUSE AND SUCH A UNION WAS NOT WITHOUT PRECEDENT
WHEN WE ARE BOTH IN A DULL MOOD FOR I WILL DEFY THE MOST HYPOCHONDRIACAL PERSON IN EXISTENCE NOT TO BURST WITH LAUGHTER AT THE NARRATIVE AS WELL AS WITH CERTAIN PASSAGES IN THE DESPATCHES OF THESE WORTHY GENTLEMEN
AFTER MUCH CONSIDERATION THEREFORE HE RESOLVED ON SERVING SARAH BUT WITH A CERTAIN QUALIFICATION WHICH WE WILL PRESENTLY REFER TO RODOLPH'S PASSION HAD REACHED A HEIGHT ALMOST OF FRENZY
REQUISITE TO CROSS THE CIRCLE TO REACH THE PLACE WHERE THE PRINCESS WAS SEATED WHO WAS ANXIOUS MOST KINDLY TO DESTROY THE RUMOUR THAT WAS CIRCULATED AND BY THE SIMPLE FACT OF THUS CROSSING THE ROOM
POSSESSION RENDERED RODOLPH MORE CIRCUMSPECT AND COOLED DOWN THAT VIOLENCE WHICH MIGHT HAVE COMPROMISED THE SECRET OF HIS PASSION FOR SARAH BUT DIRECTED BY SEYTON AND THE DOCTOR THE YOUNG COUPLE MANAGED SO WELL
OR POSSESS HER BY A SECRET MARRIAGE RODOLPH THREW HIMSELF ON POLIDORI'S NECK CALLED HIM HIS SAVIOUR HIS FRIEND HIS FATHER HE ONLY WISHED THAT THE TEMPLE AND THE PRIEST WERE AT HAND
TEMPTED TO PRESENT HIMSELF BACKWARDS THAT HIS IMPORTANCE MAY AT ONCE BE SEEN FELT AND ACKNOWLEDGED THE FACT IS THAT THE INCESSANT SUBJECT OF THE COUNT'S MEDITATIONS IS TO ASCERTAIN
THAT HE MIGHT MARRY HER THAT INSTANT THE DOCTOR RESOLVED FOR REASONS OF HIS OWN
AND TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS BOUND TO A STAKE HIS SKIN WAS TORN WITH THE LASH WHILST THEY BORE CECILY TO THE HAREM OF THE PLANTER IN HIS SIGHT THE CONDUCT OF THE PLANTER WAS BRUTAL AND HORRIBLE IT WAS ADDING ABSURDITY TO CRUELTY
RENDERED THE MORE INSUPPORTABLE BY HER PREGNANCY IN THIS EXTREMITY SHE BOLDLY PROPOSED TO THE YOUNG PRINCE TO TELL ALL TO HIS FATHER
TELL GOD TO COME AND SNATCH YOU FROM MY POWER I DEFY HIM THEN WILLIS OVERCOME BY FURY AND INTOXICATION SHOOK HIS FIST TO HEAVEN AND SAID IN BLASPHEMOUS LANGUAGE YES I DEFY GOD TO CARRY OFF MY SLAVES BEFORE THEY ARE DEAD
OUR CONDUCT WAS CONTRARY TO THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY I KNOW BUT IF YOU HAD SEEN IN WHAT A HORRIBLE STATE WE FOUND THIS UNFORTUNATE AND HALF DEAD COUPLE IF YOU HAD HEARD THE SACRILEGIOUS DEFIANCE
AND OBSERVED SO MUCH CIRCUMSPECTION TOWARDS EACH OTHER THAT THEY ELUDED ALL DETECTION AN EVENT IMPATIENTLY DESIRED BY SARAH SOON TURNED THIS CALM INTO A TEMPEST SHE WAS ABOUT TO BECOME A MOTHER
CALUMNIATORS AND PROVE TRIUMPHANTLY THAT THE FAIR PROPORTIONS OF HER PROTEGEE HAD LOST NOT ONE JOT OF THEIR SYMMETRY AND DELICACY ALAS THE MOST
SO NOW MY DEAR MURPHY FAREWELL TILL THE EVENING TILL THE EVENING ADIEU HAVE YOU THEN FORGOTTEN THAT THERE IS A GRAND BALL AT THE EMBASSY AND THAT HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL BE PRESENT
THEY SAY HE TRIED TO KILL HIS WIFE YES BUT THROUGH THE INTERFERENCE OF MONSEIGNEUR
TAKING HIS HAT UP IN HASTE
AN APPEARANCE AT ONCE CONSTRAINED AND REPULSIVE WHICH IT IS PAINFUL TO LOOK AT FOR ALAS AND ALACKADAY IT IS AT THE BACK OF A CHAMBERLAIN THAT THE SYMBOL OF HIS OFFICE GLITTERS AND AS MONSEIGNEUR AVERS
WHY MY DEAR FELLOW
THE EXPECTATION OF POSTERITY HAD REDOUBLED RODOLPH'S TENDERNESS FOR SARAH AND PLACED BETWEEN THE DESIRE TO ACCEDE TO HER WISHES AND THE DREAD OF HIS FATHER'S WRATH HE EXPERIENCED THE BITTEREST ANGUISH
AND IN A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR HIS SISTER SHE WAS CHAGRINED YET SATISFIED AT THE DEPARTURE OF HER BROTHER FOR SHE WOULD LOSE HIS ADVICE BUT THEN HE WOULD BE SAFE FROM THE GRAND DUKE'S ANGER
THE CHAISE HOUSE THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE THE LOFTS AND THE OUT BUILDINGS OF THE HOUSE WHICH WERE ALL IN EXCELLENT ORDER AND KEPT WITH A CLEANLINESS AND CARE WHICH BESPOKE REGULARITY AND EASY CIRCUMSTANCES
TO LEND HIMSELF TO THE MARRIAGE
WHAT A COUNTENANCE HE WHO LOOKED SO MILD AND GENTLE I WAS QUITE FRIGHTENED AT THAT MOMENT I WAS INDEED WELL WHAT THEN YOU SAID TO ME GOOD DAY CHOURINEUR
THEN TAKING A BAG WHICH I CARRIED
HE WAS THEIR IDOL A YEAR PASSED AWAY IN THIS MANNER
WELL WELL DON'T LET US SAY ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT ONLY I HAVE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE TO FIND YOU OUT YOU DO NOT NOW GO TO THE OGRESS'S NO WHY NOT
SEYTON GAVE THE PRINCE EIGHT DAYS TO DECIDE HIS SISTER COULD NOT LONGER ENDURE THE CRUEL ANGUISH OF UNCERTAINTY AND IF SHE MUST RENOUNCE RODOLPH'S LOVE SHE MUST ACT UP TO HER PAINFUL RESOLVE AS PROMPTLY AS MIGHT BE
HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE PARIS SOME DAYS AFTER THE AFFAIR OF THE ALLEE DES VEUVES AND HE FORGOT YOU MY MAN
BUT YOU SAID THEN THAT I MUST NOT LOOK SO LIKE A BEGGAR AS THAT WOULD FRIGHTEN THE EMPLOYER TO WHOM YOU WOULD TAKE ME I ANSWERED I HAVE NOT THE MEANS OF DRESSING OTHERWISE YOU SAID TO ME COME TO THE TEMPLE
OF BESIDES HER LOVE FOR RODOLPH IN TRUTH THIS SELFISH COLD AMBITIOUS WOMAN HAD NOT FELT THE ICE OF HER HEART MELT EVEN BY THE BEAMS OF THE PASSIONATE LOVE WHICH HAD BEEN BREATHED TO HER
RECEIVED THE DEGREE OF SURGEON AND PHYSICIAN WITH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED SUCCESS AND THEN RETURNED TO AMERICA TO PLACE HIMSELF AND HIS SKILL UNDER THE DIRECTION OF HIS MASTER
NOT SEEING HER ANY MORE AT THE OGRESS'S
MY DEAR BARON BUT IT IS GROWING LATE AND HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS IS ANXIOUS THAT YOUR COURIER SHOULD START FOR GEROLSTEIN WITH AS LITTLE DELAY AS POSSIBLE IN TWO HOURS TIME HE SHALL BE ON THE ROAD
BROUGHT ON AN INFLAMMATORY ATTACK OF THE MOST DANGEROUS DESCRIPTION THE SYMPTOMS OF WHICH APPEARED WITH THE RAPIDITY PECULIAR TO SUCH AFFECTIONS THE PLANTER WAS CARRIED TO HIS BED
AND SAYING THAT THESE PERSONS HAVE EXHIBITED A TENDENCY TO ANXIETY FROM THE OUTSET AND THEREFORE PRACTICE RESERVE IN SEXUAL MATTERS THE BEHAVIOR OF WOMEN WHOSE SEXUAL CONDUCT IS PASSIVE
AFTER FURTHER CONSIDERATION WE MUST SAY TO OURSELVES THAT THE VERDICT ON REAL FEAR WHETHER IT BE RATIONAL OR PURPOSEFUL MUST BE THOROUGHLY REVISED
BUT I DO NOT THINK THAT THE TRUE NATURE OF THE EMOTION HAS BEEN FATHOMED BY THESE ENUMERATIONS WE HAVE GAINED DEEPER INSIGHT INTO SOME EMOTIONS AND REALIZE THAT THE THREAD WHICH BINDS TOGETHER SUCH A COMPLEX AS WE HAVE DESCRIBED
AND PERHAPS WILL NEVER BE CONFRONTED WITH THAT SITUATION ONE CONSIDERATION MOREOVER MUST BE KEPT IN MIND THE CONSIDERATION OF AGE WHICH PREVENTS AN OLDER WOMAN FROM WITH A VERY YOUNG BOY MURMURS THAT WOULD BE HORRIBLE
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF THE RESULTS OF THE DREAM INTERPRETATION SEEM UNPLEASANT EVEN EMBARRASSING AND DISGUSTING TO YOU THAT DOESN'T PREVENT THEM FROM EXISTING AS I USED TO HEAR MY TEACHER CHARCOT SAY IN SIMILAR CASES WHEN I WAS A YOUNG DOCTOR ONE MUST BE HUMBLE
I AND NUMEROUS OTHER WOMEN AND GIRLS OF VIENNA ARE READY FOR THE SOLDIERS TROOPS AND OFFICERS WITHOUT DISTINCTION HERE IN THE DREAM FOLLOWS A MURMURING THAT THE IDEA IS HOWEVER CORRECTLY UNDERSTOOD BY THOSE PRESENT SHE SEES FROM THE SEMI EMBARRASSED
AND FOR THAT REASON HE SOFTENED THEM BY WAY OF PREVENTION MODIFIED THEM SLIGHTLY OR CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH INNUENDO AND ALLUSION TO WHAT REALLY WANTED TO FLOW FROM HIS PEN THUS THE SHEET IT IS TRUE HAS NO BLANK SPACES
BUT IT IS A CUSTOMARY AND VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD AND ONE TENDS RATHER TO UNDERESTIMATE THAN TO OVERESTIMATE ITS INFLUENCE AND THE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MAY FOLLOW FROM IT IN ADDITION
NOW RECALL OUR DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE OF EXTERNAL OR INTERNAL BODILY STIMULI AS DISTURBERS OF SLEEP OR AS DREAM PRODUCERS WE LEARNED DEFINITE FACTS ABOUT THIS
WHAT ELSE DOES PSYCHOANALYSIS DO HERE BUT CONFIRM THE OLD SAYING OF PLATO THAT THE GOOD PEOPLE ARE THOSE WHO CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH DREAMING WHAT THE OTHERS THE BAD PEOPLE REALLY DO AND NOW TURN YOUR ATTENTION FROM THE INDIVIDUAL CASE TO THE GREAT WAR DEVASTATING EUROPE
IT GIVES RISE TO SOMETHING WHICH WE CONSIDER THE CONDITION OF FEAR IN SO FAR AS THE DEVELOPMENT IS STILL INCIPIENT AND IS RESTRICTED TO A MERE SIGNAL THE MORE UNDISTURBED THE CONVERSION OF THE READINESS TO BE AFRAID INTO ACTION
WHICH IN THE OTHER CASE WE PERMITTED TO REMAIN PROFANE
SEXUAL ABSTINENCE RECOMMENDED SO WARMLY BY THE PHYSICIANS OF TO DAY HAS THE SAME SIGNIFICANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONDITIONS OF ANXIETY ONLY WHEN THE LIBIDO TO WHICH SATISFACTORY RELIEF IS DENIED
THINK OF THE AMOUNT OF BRUTALITY THE CRUELTY AND THE LIES ALLOWED TO SPREAD OVER THE CIVILIZED WORLD DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT A HANDFUL OF CONSCIENCELESS EGOISTS AND CORRUPTIONISTS COULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN SETTING FREE ALL THESE EVIL SPIRITS
WE ARE NOW PREPARED TO CONCLUDE THAT THERE ARE PROCESSES AND TENDENCIES IN THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF WHICH ONE KNOWS NOTHING AT ALL HAS KNOWN NOTHING FOR SOME TIME MIGHT IN FACT PERHAPS NEVER HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING
IN THIS INSTANCE ALSO THE DREAM IS THE RESULT OF COMPROMISE WE SLEEP AND YET WE EXPERIENCE THE REMOVAL OF A WISH WE GRATIFY THE WISH BUT AT THE SAME TIME CONTINUE TO SLEEP
BEING INSENSIBLE TO THE CONVENTIONAL FEELING OF DISGUST THIRD THE INCEST LIMITATION BEING PROHIBITED FROM SEEKING SEXUAL SATISFACTION WITH NEAR BLOOD RELATIONS FOURTH HOMOSEXUALITY AND FIFTH
THAT A WOMAN OF FIFTY SHOULD DREAM SUCH ABOMINABLE STUPID STUFF A WOMAN WHO HAS NO OTHER THOUGHT DAY AND NIGHT THAN TO CARE FOR HER CHILD AND NOW FOLLOWS THE DREAMS OF THE SERVICES OF LOVE
BUT IF YOU WILL LIMIT YOURSELVES TO THE AGE BEGINNING WITH CONSCIOUS PSYCHIC ACTIVITY UP TO THE FOURTH OR FIFTH YEAR YOU WILL DISCOVER A SERIES OF DREAMS THAT ARE OF A SO CALLED INFANTILE CHARACTER
YET THERE ARE INTIMATIONS GIVEN FROM WHICH SOMETHING MAY BE CONCLUDED FOR EXAMPLE THE PHRASE SERVICES OF LOVE AND ABOVE ALL THE BITS OF SPEECH WHICH IMMEDIATELY PRECEDE THE MURMURS DEMAND A COMPLETION WHICH CAN HAVE BUT ONE MEANING
ONE MAY SAY THAT SNAKEPHOBIA IS COMMON TO ALL HUMAN BEINGS AND CHARLES DARWIN HAS DESCRIBED MOST IMPRESSIVELY HOW HE WAS UNABLE TO CONTROL HIS FEAR OF A SNAKE POINTING FOR HIM THOUGH HE KNEW HE WAS SEPARATED FROM IT BY A THICK PANE OF GLASS
AND IS SUBSTANTIATED BY MEMORY YET THIS IS NO EXPLANATION IT IS LONG OUTLIVED TO DAY IT CAN BE PRESENT ONLY IN THE UNCONSCIOUS AND AS AN EMPTY EMOTIONLESS MEMORY BUT NOT AS A STRONG IMPULSE WHY SHOULD IT BE RECALLED BY THE DREAM AT ALL THIS QUESTION IS JUSTIFIED
YOU THINK THAT IT IS A PITY THAT IT PROBABLY WAS THE MOST INTERESTING PART IT WAS THE BEST PART IN OTHER PLACES THE CENSORSHIP DID NOT TOUCH THE COMPLETED SENTENCE THE AUTHOR FORESAW WHAT PARTS MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO MEET WITH THE OBJECTION OF THE CENSOR
BUT IT WOULD BE STRANGE INDEED IF THE CHILD BROUGHT FORTH COMPLETE PSYCHIC PRODUCTS IN SLEEP WHILE THE ADULT IN THE SAME CONDITION CONTENTS HIMSELF WITH SPASMODIC REACTIONS INDEED
HAVE BELONGED TO THE UNCONSCIOUS BUT SOMETIMES THEY BOB UP OUT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS SPONTANEOUSLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN DREAMS IT IS APPARENT THAT THE DREAM LIFE KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO THESE LATENT
YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT WE HAD A SURPRISING EXPERIENCE WHEN WE BEGAN TO APPLY OUR TECHNIQUE OF FREE ASSOCIATION WE THEN BEGAN TO FEEL THAT SOME SORT OF A RESISTANCE BLOCKED OUR EFFORTS TO PROCEED FROM THE DREAM ELEMENT TO THE UNCONSCIOUS ELEMENT FOR WHICH THE FORMER IS THE SUBSTITUTE
OR TO THE COITUS INTERRUPTUS BY ANXIETY MANIFESTATIONS IN ANAESTHETIC OR ONLY SLIGHTLY LIBIDINOUS WOMEN SUCH MISUSE WILL NOT CARRY SUCH CONSEQUENCES
YET IT IS JUST THIS TYPE THAT I CAN DEMONSTRATE BY THE ONLY DREAM EXAMPLE WHICH WE HAVE SO FAR ANALYZED YOU WILL REMEMBER THE DREAM OF THE THREE BAD THEATRE TICKETS FOR ONE FLORIN AND A HALF
HIS HEAD DEEPLY SUNK INTO HIS NECK I CONCLUDED FROM THE CONTENT THAT HE WAS A PHYSICIAN LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO ASK MY MOTHER WHO WAS STILL LIVING HOW THE PHYSICIAN IN MY BIRTH PLACE WHICH I LEFT WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD LOOKED
IN THESE ANIMAL PHOBIAS IT CANNOT POSSIBLY BE A QUESTION OF THE HEIGHTENING OF COMMON HUMAN ANTIPATHIES FOR AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE ANTITHESIS THERE ARE NUMEROUS PERSONS WHO CANNOT PASS A CAT
THAT SUCH WISHES AND SUCH DREAMS CANNOT OCCUR
TOWARD THOSE BEST BELOVED IN DAILY LIFE TOWARD PARENTS BROTHERS AND SISTERS TOWARD ONE'S SPOUSE AND ONE'S OWN CHILDREN THESE CENSORED WISHES SEEM TO ARISE FROM A VERITABLE HELL NO CENSORSHIP SEEMS TOO HARSH TO BE APPLIED AGAINST THEIR WAKING INTERPRETATION
AND DISCLOSE A TENDENCY TO SEPARATE THOSE OF THE SAME SEX DAUGHTER FROM MOTHER FATHER FROM SON THE DAUGHTER FINDS IN HER MOTHER THE AUTHORITY THAT HEMS IN HER WILL AND THAT IS ENTRUSTED WITH THE TASK OF CAUSING HER TO CARRY OUT
AND ANXIOUS AS THOUGH THEY MEANT THE SAME THING THAT IS UNJUSTIFIABLE THERE ARE ANXIOUS PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT NERVOUS AND NERVOUS PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM MANY SYMPTOMS BUT NOT FROM THE TENDENCY TO ANXIETY
THE SAME IS TRUE FOR THE CROWD THE ENCLOSED SPACE THE THUNDER STORM ET CETERA IT IS NOT AT ALL THE CONTENT BUT THE INTENSITY OF THESE NEUROTIC PHOBIAS THAT APPEARS STRANGE TO US
THE WORSE THE CENSORABLE WISH THE GREATER THE DISTORTION ON THE OTHER HAND HOWEVER THE STRICTER THE CENSOR HIMSELF IS AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME THE GREATER THE DISTORTION WILL BE ALSO A YOUNG STRICTLY REARED AND PRUDISH GIRL WILL BY REASON OF THOSE FACTORS
OFTEN ENOUGH THIS ATTITUDE IS SUPERSEDED BY A MORE TENDER FEELING OR RATHER LET US SAY GLOSSED OVER BUT THE HOSTILE FEELING APPEARS REGULARLY TO HAVE BEEN THE EARLIER IT IS MOST NOTICEABLE IN CHILDREN OF FROM TWO AND ONE HALF
AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVE TO US THE DOMINANCE OF THE OPPOSITE TENDENCY THIS FACT MUST FINALLY DISCONCERT US IS IT NOT TIME TO LAY ASIDE THE WHOLE WORK OF THE DREAM INTERPRETATION AS SOMETHING WHOSE RESULTS REDUCE IT TO ABSURDITY BY NO MEANS
OR THINKS OF ONLY WITH ABHORRENCE THESE CENSORED WISHES WHICH HAVE ATTAINED TO A DISTORTED EXPRESSION IN THE DREAM ARE ABOVE ALL EXPRESSIONS OF A BOUNDLESS RECKLESS EGOISM AND INDEED THE PERSONAL EGO OCCURS IN EVERY DREAM TO PLAY THE MAJOR PART IN EACH OF THEM
DREAMS OF CHILDHOOD WE THINK WE HAVE ADVANCED TOO RAPIDLY LET US GO BACK A LITTLE BEFORE OUR LAST ATTEMPT TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES OF DREAM DISTORTION THROUGH OUR TECHNIQUE
I MUST POINT OUT THAT CERTAIN WELL PRESERVED MEMORIES FOR THE MOST PART FORMATIVELY EXPERIENCED STAND FORTH IN THIS MEMORY VOID WHICH SURROUNDS THE FIRST YEARS OF CHILDHOOD AND DO NOT JUSTIFY THIS HYPOTHESIS
EVERY TIME A DREAM IS COMPLETELY COMPREHENSIBLE TO US IT PROVES TO BE AN HALLUCINATED WISH FULFILLMENT THIS COINCIDENCE CANNOT BE ACCIDENTAL NOR IS IT AN UNIMPORTANT MATTER
WHILE FEARLESSNESS AND BOLD DARING ARISE FROM FREE GRATIFICATION OF SEXUAL DESIRES HOWEVER MUCH THESE RELATIONS ARE ALTERED BY VARIOUS INFLUENCES OF CIVILIZATION FOR THE AVERAGE HUMAN BEING IT IS TRUE
IF THE MILLIONS OF FOLLOWERS DID NOT SHARE IN THE GUILT DO YOU DARE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BREAK A LANCE FOR THE ABSENCE OF EVIL FROM THE PSYCHIC CONSTITUTION OF MANKIND
HOWEVER THAT MAY BE IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE PROBLEM OF FEAR IS THE MEETING POINT OF MANY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AN ENIGMA WHOSE COMPLETE SOLUTION WOULD CAST A FLOOD OF LIGHT UPON PSYCHIC LIFE
NO ANALYSIS OF THIS DREAM WAS MADE OUR INFORMANT REMARKS THAT TO A PSYCHOANALYST IT NEEDS NO INTERPRETATION THE DREAMER HERSELF DID NOT INTERPRET IT BUT SHE JUDGED AND CONDEMNED IT AS IF SHE UNDERSTOOD ITS INTERPRETATION FOR SHE SAID CONCERNING IT
THAT OF A GAP IN THE MEMORY IS FAR MORE FREQUENT I BELIEVE WE HAVE NOT LAID ENOUGH STRESS ON THIS FACT THE CHILD IS ABLE TO SPEAK WELL AT THE AGE OF TWO IT SOON SHOWS THAT IT CAN BECOME ADJUSTED TO THE MOST COMPLICATED PSYCHIC SITUATIONS
WE MUST NOW BRING INTO THE DREAM WORK AS THE DREAM CENSOR THE RESISTANCE TO INTERPRETATION IS NOTHING BUT THE OBJECTIVATION OF THE DREAM CENSOR THE LATTER PROVES TO US THAT THE FORCE OF THE CENSOR HAS NOT SPENT ITSELF IN CAUSING THE DREAM DISTORTION
AND TO DISCUSS IT WITH YOU AT SOME LENGTH FEAR ITSELF NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION EVERYONE HAS AT SOME TIME OR OTHER KNOWN THIS SENSATION OR MORE PRECISELY THIS EFFECT
BECOME COMPLETELY EXTINCT DO YOU ALSO VENTURE TO SAY TO HIM THAT CANNOT BE SO THIS PROSPECT IS TOO UNPLEASANT ON THE CONTRARY
ARE ASHAMED AND ANGRY IF ONE OF THESE DREAMS HAS IN SOME UNUSUAL MANNER SUCCEEDED IN PENETRATING INTO CONSCIOUSNESS IN AN UNDISTORTED FORM
BUT FROM CERTAIN CIRCUMLOCUTIONS AND OBSCURITIES OF EXPRESSION YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GUESS THAT THOUGHTS OF THE CENSORSHIP WERE THE RESTRAINING MOTIVE NOW LET US KEEP TO THIS PARALLEL WE SAY THAT THE OMITTED DREAM SPEECHES WHICH WERE DISGUISED BY A MURMURING
THE STRONGEST CONDITION OF GENERAL ANXIETY NEED NOT MANIFEST ITSELF IN PHOBIAS AND PERSONS WHOSE ENTIRE LIFE IS HEMMED IN BY AGORAPHOBIA CAN BE ENTIRELY FREE OF PESSIMISTIC EXPECTANT FEAR
AND THIS LOVE IS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE OUTWORN LOVE ONE CANNOT MAINTAIN THAT THE WORLD WAS VERY GRATEFUL TO PSYCHOANALYTIC RESEARCH FOR ITS DISCOVERY OF THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX ON THE CONTRARY IT CALLED FORTH THE STRONGEST RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF ADULTS
EXECUTE THE SEXUAL ACT IN A SHORTENED OR MUTILATED FORM UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES LIBIDINOUS EXCITEMENT DISAPPEARS AND ANXIETY TAKES ITS PLACE BOTH IN THE FORM OF EXPECTANT FEAR AND
HE KNOWS NO UNBRIDGABLE CHASM BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL THE ARROGANCE WITH WHICH MAN DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF FROM THE ANIMAL IS A LATER ACQUISITION IN THE BEGINNING HE IS NOT DISGUSTED AT THE SIGHT OF EXCREMENT BUT SLOWLY LEARNS TO BE SO DISGUSTED
WAS AT THE TIME THE CAUSE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF FEAR THE FIRST FEAR WAS THEREFORE TOXIC THE NAME ANXIETY ANGUSTIAL NARROWNESS EMPHASIZES THE CHARACTERISTIC TIGHTENING OF THE BREATH
BUT COULD ONLY EXPLAIN A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF DREAMS IN THIS WAY IN THESE CHILDREN'S DREAMS NOTHING POINTS TO THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH SOMATIC STIMULI WE CANNOT BE MISTAKEN FOR THE DREAMS ARE ENTIRELY INTELLIGIBLE AND EASY TO SURVEY
SINCE THE DREAM REGRESSES TO THIS STAGE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE APPARENT THE EVIL THAT LIES IN US BUT IT IS ONLY A DECEPTIVE APPEARANCE BY WHICH WE HAVE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO BE FRIGHTENED WE ARE NOT SO EVIL AS WE MIGHT SUSPECT FROM THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS
A COLLISION FOR INSTANCE MAY OCCUR OR A SHIP SINK WHEN AS A RULE WE MUST DROWN YET WE DO NOT THINK OF THESE DANGERS AND FREE FROM FEAR WE TRAVEL ON TRAIN AND BOAT WE CANNOT DENY THAT IF A BRIDGE SHOULD COLLAPSE AT THE MOMENT WE ARE CROSSING IT
BUT A GUARDIAN OF SLEEP WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO QUELL DISTURBANCES IT IS TRUE WE THINK WE WOULD HAVE SLEPT BETTER IF WE HAD NOT DREAMT BUT HERE WE ARE WRONG AS A MATTER OF FACT WE WOULD NOT HAVE SLEPT AT ALL WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE DREAM
WE DEEM IT QUITE A MATTER OF COURSE THAT THE SAVAGE FEARS A CANNON OR AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN WHILE THE WHITE MAN
WITHOUT CALLING AND PETTING IT THE MOUSE OF WHICH WOMEN ARE SO MUCH AFRAID IS AT THE SAME TIME A FIRST CLASS PET NAME MANY A GIRL WHO HAS BEEN GRATIFIED TO HAVE HER LOVER CALL HER SO SCREAMS WHEN SHE SEES THE CUNNING LITTLE CREATURE ITSELF
SHE FINDS HERSELF IN A LARGE SOMBER ROOM IN WHICH THERE ARE MANY OFFICERS AND ARMY DOCTORS SITTING AND STANDING AROUND A LONG TABLE SHE TURNS WITH HER PROPOSAL TO A STAFF DOCTOR WHO AFTER A FEW WORDS SOON UNDERSTANDS HER THE WORDS OF HER SPEECH IN THE DREAM ARE
IN GOING UP SHE HEARS AN OFFICER SAY THAT IS A TREMENDOUS DECISION IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER A WOMAN IS YOUNG OR OLD ALL HONOR TO HER
IS THE REPETITION OF A CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE THIS EXPERIENCE MIGHT BE AN EARLY IMPRESSION OF A VERY GENERAL SORT WHICH BELONGS TO THE ANTECEDENT HISTORY OF THE SPECIES RATHER THAN TO THAT OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE MORE CLEAR
RATHER THAN THAT THIS TASK SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE CYNIC IN ANY EVENT THIS DENIAL REFERS ONLY TO ACTUAL LIFE THE ARTS OF NARRATIVE AND DRAMATIC POETRY ARE STILL FREE TO MAKE USE OF THE MOTIVES THAT RESULT FROM A DISTURBANCE OF THIS IDEAL
IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT IN THE CASE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE DREAM DISCLOSES THE WISH FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE PARENTS ESPECIALLY THE PARENT OF THE SAME SEX WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT IT IS ALSO PRESENT DURING WAKING HOURS
THOSE DIRECTED TOWARDS SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH PARENTS AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS YOU KNOW WHAT ANTIPATHY SOCIETY FEELS TOWARD SUCH INTERCOURSE OR AT LEAST PRETENDS TO FEEL AND WHAT WEIGHT IS LAID ON THE PROHIBITIONS DIRECTED AGAINST IT
I DO NOT WISH TO MAINTAIN THAT THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX COVERS ENTIRELY THE RELATION OF THE CHILD TO ITS PARENTS THIS RELATION CAN BE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED FURTHERMORE THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX IS MORE OR LESS WELL DEVELOPED IT MAY EVEN EXPERIENCE A REVERSAL
IF THEIR SEXUAL EXCITATION DOES NOT MEET WITH SUFFICIENT RELIEF AND IS NOT BROUGHT TO A SATISFACTORY CONCLUSION IN MEN DURING THE TIME OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT TO MARRY FOR INSTANCE OR IN WOMEN WHOSE HUSBANDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY POTENT OR WHO FROM CAUTION
WHO WERE SO FORTUNATE AS TO ESCAPE IN LATER LIFE THESE CONFLICTS WITH THEIR PARENTS AND INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED THEREWITH WE FIND WHAT WE CALL THE CASTRATION COMPLEX THE REACTION TO SEXUAL INTIMIDATION OR RESTRICTION ASCRIBED TO THE FATHER
AS THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF HYSTERIC SYMPTOMS OR UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF EXCITEMENT WHERE WE WOULD EXPECT AN EMOTIONAL MANIFESTATION BUT LEAST OF ALL OF FEAR OR WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ANY KNOWN CIRCUMSTANCE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO US AND TO THE PATIENT
YOU DO SO WITH THE SAME MOTIVES WITH WHICH THE DREAM CENSOR WORKS THE MOTIVES WITH WHICH IT PRODUCES THE DREAM DISTORTION AND MAKES THE INTERPRETATION NECESSARY RECALL THE DREAM OF OUR FIFTY YEAR OLD LADY WITHOUT HAVING INTERPRETED IT SHE CONSIDERS HER DREAM ABOMINABLE
THIS IS IN ACCORD WITH OUR EXPECTATION WE FIND IT MUCH MORE OFFENSIVE FOR LOVE BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN TO BE LACKING THAN FOR LOVE BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE HAVE SO TO SPEAK MADE SOMETHING HOLY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
THE INFLUENCE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEUROTIC FEAR OF CERTAIN PHASES OF LIFE SUCH AS PUBERTY AND THE PERIOD OF MENOPAUSE WHEN THE PRODUCTION OF LIBIDO IS MATERIALLY HEIGHTENED BELONGS HERE TOO IN SOME CONDITIONS OF EXCITEMENT WE MAY OBSERVE THE MIXTURE OF ANXIETY AND LIBIDO
WE BECOME AWARE OF DREAMS ENTIRELY FREE OF DISTORTION ONLY AFTER THE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF OUR METHOD OF INTERPRETATION AND AFTER COMPLETE ANALYSIS OF THE DISTORTED DREAM
THE PERCEPTION OF MOTOR ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE ALREADY TAKEN PLACE AND THE DIRECT SENSATIONS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN WHICH GIVE THE EFFECT OF WHAT WE CALL ITS FEELING TONE
THESE RESULTS ARE IMPOSSIBLE FOOLISH AT LEAST VERY IMPROBABLE HENCE THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE HYPOTHESES EITHER THE DREAM IS NO PSYCHIC PHENOMENON AFTER ALL OR THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS UNCONSCIOUS MENTAL ACTIVITY IN THE NORMAL CONDITION
YOU WILL REPROACH ME WITH JUDGING THE WAR ONE SIDEDLY YOU WILL SAY THAT IT HAS ALSO BROUGHT FORTH ALL THAT IS MOST BEAUTIFUL AND NOBLE IN MANKIND ITS HEROIC COURAGE ITS SELF SACRIFICE ITS SOCIAL FEELING CERTAINLY
UNDER THE PRESSURE OF EDUCATION HE LAYS NO SPECIAL STRESS ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEXES RATHER ACCREDITS TO BOTH THE SAME GENITAL FORMATION
IN THE MOST FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES DOES NOT ATTACK THE INTERPRETATION ITSELF HE ALMOST ALWAYS ASKS THE QUESTION WHENCE SUCH A WISH COMES
THIRTEENTH LECTURE THE DREAM ARCHAIC REMNANTS AND INFANTILISM IN THE DREAM LET US REVERT TO OUR CONCLUSION THAT THE DREAM WORK UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DREAM CENSORSHIP
AND MANY OF ITS INDIVIDUAL POINTS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ELUCIDATED AS TO CONTENT THROUGH INQUIRY WHICH AS YOU KNOW WAS OMITTED THE CONSPICUOUS AND INTERESTING POINT FOR US HOWEVER IS THAT THE DREAM SHOWS SEVERAL GAPS GAPS NOT OF RECOLLECTION BUT OF ORIGINAL CONTENT
WON'T YOU COME HOME WITH US I'D LIKE TO REPLIED BUTTON BRIGHT ALL RIGHT LET'S GO THEN SAID THE GIRL JUMPING UP THE THREE WALKED SILENTLY ALONG THE PATH THE OLD SAILORMAN HAD REFILLED HIS PIPE AND LIGHTED IT AGAIN
THE WOMEN SEEMED JUST AS REPELLENT AS THE MEN AND BUTTON BRIGHT BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE SIX
A GUARD WAS PACING UP AND DOWN NEAR HER BUT AS HE COULD NOT SEE THE GIRL HE OF COURSE PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER SO AFTER MARKING THE PLACE WHERE THE LADDER HUNG THAT SHE MIGHT KNOW HOW TO REACH IT AGAIN
I'M RIGHT HERE SAID TROT'S VOICE BY HIS SIDE CAN'T YOU SEE ME NO REPLIED THE BOY MYSTIFIED ROSALIE LAUGHED IT'S A MAGIC RING I'VE LOANED YOU MY DEAR SAID SHE AND AS LONG AS YOU WEAR IT YOU WILL BE INVISIBLE TO ALL EYES
THIS TIME ACROSS THE COUNTRY STRAIGHT TOWARD THE FOG BANK WHICH HUNG LIKE A BLUE GRAY CLOUD DIRECTLY ACROSS THE CENTER OF THE ISLAND THEY KNEW THEY WERE BEING FOLLOWED BY BANDS OF THE BLUESKINS FOR THEY COULD HEAR THE SHOUTS OF THEIR PURSUERS GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER EVERY MINUTE
DOESN'T THE SUN EVER SHINE ASKED CAP'N BILL NOT IN THE BLUE PART OF SKY ISLAND REPLIED GHIP GHISIZZLE THE MOON SHINES HERE EVERY NIGHT BUT WE NEVER SEE THE SUN I AM TOLD HOWEVER THAT ON THE OTHER HALF OF THE ISLAND
LONG ENOUGH TO REACH TO THE TOP OF THE WALL WHEN IT WAS FINISHED THE THREE ROSALIE TROT AND BUTTON BRIGHT STOLE OUT INTO THE MOONLIGHT AND CREPT UNOBSERVED INTO THE SHADOW OF THE WALL THE BLUESKINS WERE NOT KEEPING A VERY CLOSE WATCH
REPLIED THE FRIGHTENED BOOLOOROO WE'RE NOT GOIN TO SAID TROT
FOR WE HAVE A RIGHT ARM TOO AND IT IS PRETTY STRONG WE WILL TEST IT SUGGESTED THE OTHER BY ALL PULLING UPON ONE END OF THIS BENCH WITH OUR RIGHT ARMS
SAID GHIP GHISIZZLE THAT'S A LONG TIME TO REMEMBER AND WE BLUESKINS TRY TO FORGET ALL WE CAN ESPECIALLY WHATEVER IS UNPLEASANT THOSE WHO REMEMBER ARE USUALLY THE UNHAPPY ONES
THEY MUST BE DRIVEN BACK WITH SHARP STICKS HAVE YOU READ THIS LAW TOURMALINE YES SAID THE QUEEN BUT HOW DOES THAT APPLY TO THESE STRANGERS WHY BEING IN THE PINK COUNTRY AS THEY SURELY ARE AND NOT BEING BLUESKINS
NOT VERY REPLIED CAP'N BILL WITH A SMILE WE'VE CITIES ON THE EARTH TEN TIMES BIGGER AN THEN SOME BIG BESIDES WE'D CALL THIS A SMALL TOWN IN OUR COUNTRY
SO THAT THEY FOLLOWED ALMOST A BEE LINE TO THEIR DESTINATION IT RAINED ALL THE WAY AND THE WALKING WAS VERY DISAGREEABLE BUT OUR FRIENDS WERE CONFRONTING AN IMPORTANT CRISIS IN THEIR STRANGE ADVENTURES AND WITH POSSIBLE DEATH AT THEIR JOURNEY'S END THEY WERE IN NO HURRY TO ARRIVE THERE
GRADUALLY THIS BLUE BECAME FAINTER UNTIL AS THEY PROGRESSED EVERYTHING BECAME A DULL GRAY I WONDER HOW FAR IT IS TO THE OTHER SIDE REMARKED TROT WEARILY WE CAN'T SAY TILL WE GET THERE MATE ANSWERED THE SAILOR IN A CHEERFUL VOICE
WHERE'S THE UMBREL ASKED CAP'N BILL I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T FIND IT BUT ALL THE PALACE IS AROUSED AND THE BOOLOOROO IS FURIOUS COME LET'S GET AWAY AT ONCE WHERE'LL WE GO INQUIRED TROT WE MUST MAKE FOR THE OPEN COUNTRY AND HIDE IN THE FOG BANK OR IN THE ARCH OF PHINIS REPLIED THE BOY
AND TRIED TO THINK WHAT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BECOME OF THE PRECIOUS UMBRELLA WHILE THEY WERE SITTING AND TALKING TOGETHER THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS ENTERED AND BOWED RESPECTFULLY BEG PARDON YOUR SMALL SIZED MAJESTY
DANGLING HIS LONG LEGS OVER THE EDGE WHEN SHE FINALLY OPENED THE DOOR HE SLIPPED OFF AND LET HIMSELF FALL TO THE WALL WHERE HE DOUBLED UP IN A HEAP THE NEXT MINUTE HOWEVER HE HAD SCRAMBLED TO HIS FEET AND WAS RUNNING SWIFTLY ALONG THE GARDEN WALL
TO BE SURE THE MAGIC UMBRELLA WAS NOW IN THE BLUE COUNTRY AND THE FAIRIES THAT DIRECTED ITS FLIGHT MIGHT BE WITH THE UMBRELLA INSTEAD OF WITH THEM YET THE OLD SAILOR HAD ALREADY EXPERIENCED SOME STRANGE ADVENTURES IN TROT'S COMPANY
KER CHOO GRUNTED THE FROG
BECAUSE IT'S THE BIGGEST LOT OF WATER IN ALL THE WORLD HOW DO YOU KNOW CAP'N BILL TOLD ME SHE SAID WHO'S CAP'N BILL AN OLD SAILORMAN WHO'S A FRIEND OF MINE HE LIVES AT MY HOUSE TOO THE WHITE HOUSE YOU SEE OVER THERE ON THE BLUFF
I'LL BE QUIET PROMISED THE BOY INDEED BUTTON BRIGHT HAD NO DESIRE TO WAKEN THE BOOLOOROO WHOM HE FOUND SNORING LUSTILY WITH THE CURTAINS OF HIS HIGH POSTED BED DRAWN TIGHTLY AROUND HIM THE BOY HAD TAKEN OFF HIS OWN SHOES AFTER HE PASSED THE GUARD
DISPLAYING THEIR CHUBBY PINK ANKLES AND PINK KID SHOES THEY WORE RINGS AND NECKLACES AND BRACELETS AND BROOCHES OF ROSE GOLD SET WITH PINK GEMS AND ALL FOUR OF THE NEW ARRIVALS
THEREFORE IF YOU WILL PLEASE BE PATIENT FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS YOU WILL DISCOVER WHAT HAPPENS TO ONE WHO BREAKS THE LAW THANK'E REMARKED CAP'N BILL I DON'T EXPECT TO BE VERY CURIOUS A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW
AND ALL THE OTHER PINKIES NODDED THEIR HEADS AND REPEATED TRUE TRUE THE ROSE IS RED THE VIOLET'S BLUE THE LAW'S THE THING BECAUSE IT'S TRUE CRIED THE PARROT I AM INDEED RELIEVED TO HAVE YOU INTERPRET THE LAW IN THIS WAY DECLARED TOURMALINE
THE QUEEN OF THE MERMAIDS GAVE IT TO ME ANSWERED TROT BUT SKY ISLAND IS SO FAR AWAY FROM THE SEA THAT THE RING WON'T DO ME ANY GOOD WHILE I'M HERE IT'S ONLY TO CALL THE MERMAIDS TO ME IF I NEED THEM AND THEY CAN'T SWIM IN THE SKY YOU SEE
BUT A DISTINCT PINK THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE SKY JUST NOW
EVEN THE GRAVEL IN THE PRETTY PATHS WAS PINK
YOU ARE LIABLE TO BE PATCHED WHAT'S BEING PATCHED INQUIRED THE GIRL THE SOLDIERS ALL LAUGHED AT THIS QUESTION BUT THE KING DID NOT REPLY JUST THEN A DOOR IN THE PALACE OPENED AND OUT TROOPED A GROUP OF GIRLS
SHE WAS EXQUISITELY FAIR DAINTY AS A LILY AND GRACEFUL AS A BOUGH SWAYING IN THE BREEZE WHY IT'S POLYCHROME EXCLAIMED BUTTON BRIGHT IN A VOICE OF MINGLED WONDER AND DELIGHT HELLO POLLY DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME
I'M PRETTY SURE IT'LL TAKE ALL O YOU YOUNG LADY AN THE CHANCES ARE YOU WON'T DO IT THEN THEY HAD HALTED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE BUSHES AND NOW THERE SUDDENLY APPEARED THROUGH A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS AN IMMENSE RAINBOW
THEY ARE BY THIS LAW ENTITLED TO PROTECTION TO A HOME AND GOOD LIVING THE LAW DOES NOT SAY PINKIES IT SAYS ANY WHO ARE IN THE PINK COUNTRY TRUE AGREED CORALIE GREATLY PLEASED
BECAUSE THE BOOLOOROO KEEPS IT SAFELY LOCKED UP IN HIS TREASURE CHAMBER WHERE'S THE KEY TO THE TREASURE CHAMBER ASKED BUTTON BRIGHT THE BOOLOOROO KEEPS IT IN HIS POCKET NIGHT AND DAY WAS THE REPLY
AND THE ONLY REMINDER OF IT WAS THE LOVELY POLYCHROME STANDING AMONG THE WONDERING BAND OF PINKIES TELL ME SHE SAID GENTLY TO THE BOY WHY ARE YOU HERE AND WHY DO THESE PEOPLE OF THE SKY WISH TO DESTROY YOU IN A FEW HURRIED WORDS
I'VE AN IDEA YOUR MAJESTY ANNOUNCED THE SIXTH SNUBNOSED PRINCESS WHOSE COMPLEXION WAS RATHER DARKER THAN THAT OF HER SISTERS AND IT HAS COME TO ME QUITE DELIBERATELY WITHOUT ANY HURRY AT ALL
THEY WERE ALL ASTONISHED TO HEAR THE BIRD TALK AND IN POETRY TOO BUT CAP'N BILL TOLD TROT THAT SOME PARROTS HE HAD KNOWN HAD POSSESSED A PRETTY FAIR GIFT OF LANGUAGE AND HE ADDED THAT THIS BLUE ONE SEEMED AN UNUSUALLY BRIGHT BIRD AS FER PO'TRY SAID HE
GREET YOUR NEW QUEEN PINKIES ONE BY ONE THEY ALL ADVANCED KNELT BEFORE TROT AND PRESSED HER HAND TO THEIR LIPS LONG LIVE QUEEN MAYRE CALLED OUT CAP'N BILL DANCING AROUND ON HIS WOODEN LEG IN GREAT DELIGHT VIVE LA
I MERELY RAN BACK TO THE CITY TO GET A DRINK OF WATER FOR I WAS THIRSTY DECLARED THE BOOLOOROO SO DID WE SO DID WE CRIED THE SOLDIERS EAGERLY WE WERE ALL THIRSTY YOUR HIGH AND MIGHTY SPRY AND FLIGHTY MAJESTY REMARKED THE CAPTAIN RESPECTFULLY
NO SAID GHIP GHISIZZLE BUT NO ONE HAS EVER GONE INTO THE BLUE GROTTO UNTIL HIS ALLOTTED TIME WAS UP WELL I'M GOING TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT DECLARED THE BOOLOOROO I SHALL MARCH THESE THREE STRANGERS THROUGH THE ARCH AND IF BY ANY CHANCE THEY COME OUT ALIVE I'LL DO A NEW SORT OF PATCHING
BECAUSE HERE IS ONE LIGHTER IN COLOR THAN YOURSELF POINTING TO TROT THIS GIRL IS BY THE LAW OF THE GREAT BOOK THE RIGHTFUL QUEEN OF THE PINKIES AND AS LOYAL CITIZENS YOU ARE ALL OBLIGED TO OBEY HER COMMANDS
THEY DID NOT STOP TO ARGUE ANY LONGER BUT ALL THREE STEPPED OUT OF THE LITTLE DOOR INTO THE STREET WHERE THEY FIRST CLASPED HANDS SO THEY WOULD NOT GET SEPARATED IN THE DARK AND THEN RAN AS SWIFTLY AS THEY COULD DOWN THE STREET WHICH WAS DESERTED AT THIS HOUR BY THE CITIZENS
FOR ASIDE FROM THE DANGER THAT THREATENED THEM IN THE BLUE COUNTRY THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND WAS VERY DEPRESSING HERE THE SCENE THAT CONFRONTED THEM WAS PRETTY AND HOMELIKE
AS THEY WERE CONFIDENT THE PINKIES COULD NOT GET INTO THE CITY THE HARDEST PART OF ROSALIE'S TASK WAS TO TOSS UP ONE END OF THE ROPE LADDER UNTIL IT WOULD CATCH ON SOME PROJECTION ON TOP OF THE WALL THERE WERE FEW SUCH PROJECTIONS
THESE PEOPLE WANT TO KILL US POLLY CAN'T YOU HELP US POLLY WANTS A CRACKER POLLY WANTS A CRACKER SCREECHED THE PARROT
THEN HE TOUCHED THE END OF HIS NOSE AND STILL ANOTHER BELL WAS FAINTLY HEARD THE BOOLOOROO SAID NOT A WORD WHILE HE WAS RINGING THE BELLS AND TROT WONDERED IF THAT WAS THE WAY HE AMUSED HIMSELF BUT NOW THE FROWN DIED AWAY FROM HIS FACE AND WAS REPLACED BY A
AND BEGAN TO RUN TOWARD THE PINKIES THE BOOLOOROO WENT OUT TOO BUT HE KEPT WELL BEHIND HIS PEOPLE REMEMBERING THE SHARP STICKS WITH WHICH THE ENEMY WERE ARMED
HERE'S A RIDDLE FOR US TO GUESS TROT HE DROPPED FROM THE SKY HE SAYS AN YET HE DID'NT COME IN A AIRSHIP
FOR HE HATED THE PRINCESSES AS DID ALL THE BLUESKINS THEN ESCORT THOSE GIRLS TO THEIR ROOMS LOCK EM IN AN PUT A GUARD BEFORE THE DOOR
A FEARFUL PLACE IT MUST BE INDEED SAID THE BLUESKIN WITH A SHUDDER
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE KING'S APARTMENTS THERE WAS ANOTHER GUARD BEFORE THE DOOR THIS TIME A LONG NECKED SOLDIER WITH A TERRIBLE SCOWL THIS SLAVE IS THE ROYAL BOOTBLUE SAID GHIP GHISIZZLE TO THE GUARD
AND HERE THE SERVANTS AND SOLDIERS DARE NOT INJURE YOU FOR FEAR OF THE BOOLOOROO HE PLACED TROT AND HER SIX PETS WHICH FOLLOWED HER WHEREVER SHE WENT IN ONE ROOM AND CAP'N BILL IN ANOTHER AND TOOK BUTTON BRIGHT AWAY WITH HIM TO SHOW THE BOY THE WAY TO THE KING'S BEDCHAMBER
PROBABLY NOT SAID THE CRAB IT'S NO PLACE FOR ME ANYHOW FOR I BELONG IN THE CONSTELLATIONS YOU KNOW WITH
KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY AND YOU WILL BE PERFECTLY SAFE DON'T LOSE THE RING FOR YOU MUST GIVE IT BACK TO ME WHEN YOU RETURN IT IS ONE OF MY WITCHCRAFT TREASURES AND I NEED IT IN MY BUSINESS THEN TROT CLIMBED THE LADDER
BUT AS THEY SAT UPON THE PINK GRASS THEY FELT THE RAYS OF THE SUN SENDING THEM WARMTH
AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT WERE PACKED IN THE LUNCH BASKET THEY WERE HUNGRY FROM THE LONG RIDE AND WHILE THEY ATE THEY KEPT THEIR EYES BUSILY EMPLOYED IN EXAMINING ALL THE QUEER THINGS AROUND THEM
PERHAPS I'LL BE ABLE TO SAVE CAP'N BILL MYSELF BUT IF I DON'T IT'S ALL UP TO YOU BUTTON BRIGHT I'LL DO MY BEST HE PROMISED AND HERE KEEP MY POLLY TILL I COME BACK ADDED TROT GIVING HIM THE BIRD I CAN'T TAKE IT WITH ME
WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS SOME SHARP CONTRAST TO ENHANCE THE CHARM OF YOUR COUNTRY AND TO KEEP THESE THREE PEOPLE WITH YOU WOULD BE A BENEFIT RATHER THAN AN INJURY TO YOU AT THIS THE PINKIES LOOKED DOWNCAST AND ASHAMED
WHO HAS IN SOME WAY MANAGED TO ESCAPE FROM THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE NO ONE KNOWS HOW BUT TIGGLE AND TIGGLE WON'T TELL WE'RE SORRY FOR ANYONE WHO HAS TO BE PATCHED REPLIED FREDJIM IN A REFLECTIVE TONE
ROSALIE SMILED AND KISSED HER AGAIN BE BRAVE MY DEAR SHE SAID AND I AM SURE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO FIND CAP'N BILL WITHOUT GETTING IN DANGER YOURSELF BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO LET ANY BLUESKIN TOUCH YOU
YOU WOULD BE CAPTURED I'LL RISK THAT SAID THE CHILD EXCITED AT THE PROSPECT OF GAINING THE SIDE OF CAP'N BILL IN THIS ADVENTUROUS WAY PLEASE MAKE THE ROPE LADDER AT ONCE ROSALIE SO THE WITCH TOOK SOME ROPES AND KNOTTED TOGETHER A LADDER
THREE DAYS IS A LONG TIME REMARKED TROT DISMALLY THE BOOLOOROO MAY DECIDE TO PATCH HIM AT ONCE ADDED BUTTON BRIGHT WITH EQUAL SADNESS FOR HE TOO MOURNED THE SAILOR'S LOSS IT CAN'T BE HELPED REPLIED ROSALIE I AM NOT A FAIRY MY DEARS
AND FINALLY THE LUNCH BASKET WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO THE LOWER SEAT AT EVERY FEW STEPS SOME OF THESE WOULD TRIP UP THE CAPTAIN AND CAUSE HIM TO TAKE A TUMBLE
BUT AFTER CREEPING ALONG THE WALL FOR A DISTANCE THEY SAW THE END OF A BROKEN FLAGSTAFF NEAR THE TOP EDGE THE WITCH TOSSED UP THE LADDER TRYING TO CATCH IT UPON THIS POINT AND ON THE SEVENTH ATTEMPT SHE SUCCEEDED GOOD CRIED TROT
THEN A PANIC FELL UPON THE PINKIES AT THE LOSS OF THEIR LEADER AND TROT AND BUTTON BRIGHT CALLED OUT IN VAIN FOR THEM TO RESCUE CAP'N BILL BY THE TIME THE ARMY RECOVERED THEIR WITS AND PREPARED TO OBEY IT WAS TOO LATE
NOW I CAN CLIMB UP DON'T YOU WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU ASKED BUTTON BRIGHT A LITTLE WISTFULLY NO SAID THE GIRL YOU MUST STAY TO LEAD THE ARMY AND IF YOU CAN THINK OF A WAY YOU MUST TRY TO RESCUE US
AND WHEN TROT AND CAP'N BILL WERE LEFT ALONE THEY TURNED THE GOAT LOOSE IN THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE AND THEN LOCKED THE ANIMAL IN
THE TERRIBLE TEETH CAME TOGETHER AND BURIED THEMSELVES IN THE PILLOW AND THEN MISTER WOLF FOUND HE COULD NOT PULL THEM OUT AGAIN BECAUSE HIS MOUTH WAS STUFFED FULL HE COULD NOT EVEN GROWL OR YELP
THEIR DREADFUL COLOR MAKES ME HYSTERICAL HE SAID TO HIS SOLDIERS SO IF I AM TO HAVE ANY PEACE OF MIND WE MUST CHARGE THE FOE AND DRIVE THEM BACK INTO THE FOG BANK
THEN HE SAW THAT HE HAD STUMBLED OVER THE CLAW OF A GIGANTIC LAND CRAB WHICH LAY SPRAWLED OUT UPON THE PEBBLY BOTTOM OH BEG PARDING I'M SURE EXCLAIMED CAP'N BILL BACKING AWAY DON'T MENTION IT REPLIED THE CRAB IN A TIRED TONE YOU DID NOT DISTURB ME SO THERE IS NO HARM DONE
THEY DO NOT HARMONIZE WITH OUR COLOR SCHEME REPLIED TOURMALINE THAT IS UTTER NONSENSE DECLARED POLYCHROME IMPATIENTLY YOU'RE SO DREADFULLY PINK HERE THAT YOUR COLOR WHICH IN ITSELF IS BEAUTIFUL HAS BECOME TAME AND INSIPID
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU WAS IN THE LAND OF OZ OH CRIED TROT TURNING TO STARE AT THE BOY WITH BIG WIDE OPEN EYES WERE YOU EVER IN THE LAND OF OZ YES HE ANSWERED STILL LOOKING AT THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER AND THEN HE SAID APPEALINGLY
SET ON THE ENDS OF LONG THIN NECKS SEEMED SO GROTESQUE TO THE STRANGERS THAT THEY COULD SCARCELY FORBEAR LAUGHING AT THEM
BLACK NECKSCARF WAS FLUTTERING BEHIND HIM IN THE BREEZE LIKE A SABLE BANNER BUTTON BRIGHT LIKED THE SAILOR'S LOOKS THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY WINNING SOMETHING JOLLY AND CARE FREE AND HONEST AND SOCIABLE ABOUT THE
YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT THEN
BUT I NOTICE THAT WHENEVER ANY OF MY SUBJECTS GET NEAR THE END OF THEIR SIX HUNDRED THEY GROW NERVOUS AND SAY THE LIFE IS ALTOGETHER TOO SHORT HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED ASKED BUTTON BRIGHT THE KING COUGHED AGAIN AND TURNED A BIT BLUER
YOUR DUTY WILL BE TO KEEP THE BOOTS AND SHOES OF THE ROYAL FAMILY NICELY POLISHED WITH BLUE I DON'T KNOW HOW ANSWERED BUTTON BRIGHT SURLILY YOU'LL SOON LEARN THE ROYAL STEWARD WILL SUPPLY YOU WITH BLUE PASTE
THE DOUBLE PATCH OF THE FREDJIM WHOM YOU HAVE MET AND THE INSIDE GUARD IS A RAVENOUS CREATURE KNOWN AS THE BLUE WOLF WHICH HAS TEETH A FOOT LONG AND AS SHARP AS NEEDLES OH
HERE ALL ALONE IT'S PRETTY FAR BUT HERE WE ARE AND THEN HE BARKED LIKE A DOG AND CHUCKLED WITH GLEE AT HAVING FOUND HIS LITTLE FRIEND IN ESCAPING FROM THE PALACE TROT HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO LEAVE ALL THE PETS BEHIND HER BUT IT SEEMED THAT THE PARROT HAD FOUND SOME WAY TO GET FREE AND FOLLOW HER
NOT ANY MORE REPLIED TROT I'M QUEEN OF THE PINKIES AN I'M ALSO QUEEN OF THE BLUES SO I WON'T HAVE MY PEOPLE QUARRELING
IN WHICH SHE SAW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON INSIDE THE CITY WALL QUEEN TROT AND CAP'N BILL AND BUTTON BRIGHT SAW THE VISION TOO FOR THEY WERE ALL IN THE TENT TOGETHER AND THE SIGHT MADE THEM ANXIOUS WHAT CAN BE DONE ASKED THE GIRL
WHILE HUNDREDS OF PINK BANNERS FLOATED FROM ITS NUMEROUS DOMES THE COUNTRY BETWEEN THE FOG BANK AND THE CITY WAS LIKE A VAST GARDEN VERY CAREFULLY KEPT AND AS NEAT AS WAX
WHAT COUNTRY DID YOU COME FROM
ALL RIGHT ANSWERED THE GUARD OUR BOOLOOROO IS IN AN UGLY MOOD TO NIGHT IT WILL GO HARD WITH THIS LITTLE SHORT NECKED CREATURE IF HE DOESN'T POLISH THE SHOES PROPERLY THEN GHIP GHISIZZLE LEFT BUTTON BRIGHT AND WENT AWAY AND THE BOY PASSED THROUGH SEVERAL ROOMS TO THE ROYAL BEDCHAMBER
AND NOW HE TIPTOED CAREFULLY INTO THE ROOM SET DOWN THE ROYAL SHOES VERY GENTLY AND THEN CREPT TO THE CHAIR WHERE HIS MAJESTY'S CLOTHES WERE PILED
CRIED CAP'N BILL IN SURPRISE
I KNEW IT WAS CRUEL TO THROW THESE POOR PEOPLE OVER THE EDGE BUT THAT SEEMED TO US THE ONLY THING TO BE DONE IT WAS CRUEL AND UNJUST ANSWERED POLYCHROME AS STERNLY AS HER SWEET VOICE COULD SPEAK
AS THEY PROCEEDED THEY PASSED MANY ROOMS WITH CLOSED DOORS AND BEFORE ONE OF THESE A PATCHED BLUESKIN WAS PACING UP AND DOWN IN A TIRED AND SLEEPY WAY IT WAS JIMFRED JINKSJONES THE DOUBLE OF THE FREDJIM JONESJINKS THEY HAD TALKED WITH IN THE SERVANTS HALL
THEY COULD NOT GO VERY FAST BECAUSE THE SAILORMAN'S WOODEN LEG WAS AWKWARD TO RUN WITH AND HELD THEM BACK BUT CAP'N BILL HOBBLED QUICKER THAN HE HAD EVER HOBBLED BEFORE IN ALL HIS LIFE AND THEY REALLY MADE PRETTY GOOD PROGRESS
SOME OF THE BLUESKINS INSISTED THAT THE ANIMALS AND BIRDS MUST BE PUT OUT OF THE ROOM BUT GHIP GHISIZZLE SAID THEY COULD REMAIN AS THEY WERE THE FAVORED PETS OF THE LOVELY SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES CAP'N BILL WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HIS DEAR LITTLE FRIEND AGAIN AND SO WAS BUTTON BRIGHT
I KNOW A HOUSE WHERE I CAN HIDE SO SNUGLY THAT ALL THE BOOLOOROO'S SOLDIERS CANNOT FIND ME ALL RIGHT SAID TROT I'LL DO IT FOR WHEN YOU'RE GONE THE BOOLOOROO WILL HAVE NO ONE TO PATCH CAP'N BILL TO HE MAY FIND SOME ONE ELSE SUGGESTED THE PRISONER
ALSO IT IS FULL OF DAMPNESS THAT WETS YOUR CLOTHES AND YOUR HAIR UNTIL YOU BECOME MISERABLE IT IS FURTHERMORE SAID THAT THOSE WHO ENTER THE FOG BANK FORFEIT THE SIX HUNDRED YEARS ALLOWED THEM TO LIVE AND ARE LIABLE TO DIE AT ANY TIME
SKY KEERIDGES
THE BOY GLANCED AT HIS UMBRELLA AND HUGGED IT TIGHTER NO HE SAID BUT UMBRELLAS ARE GOOD FOR OTHER THINGS SIDES RAIN FRAID OF GETT'N SUN STRUCK ASKED TROT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD STILL GAZING FAR OUT OVER THE WATER
AND ONE SMASHED A MIRROR WHILE THE OTHER SHATTERED A VASE ON A SMALL TABLE HIS MAJESTY LOOKED AROUND FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO THROW BUT THE BOY SEIZED THE SHOES AND RAN AWAY RETURNING TO HIS OWN ROOM WHILE HE POLISHED THE SHOES HE TOLD HIS PLANS TO CAP'N BILL AND TROT
THESE MEN SEEMED TO BE SOLDIERS ALTHOUGH THEY BORE NO ARMS EXCEPT THE CORDS EACH CORD HAD A WEIGHT AT THE END AND WHEN THE WEIGHT WAS SKILLFULLY THROWN BY A SOLDIER IT WOUND THE CORD AROUND ANYTHING IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE
AT ONCE HE DECIDED THIS MUST BE THE KEY TO THE TREASURE CHAMBER BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE HE SEARCHED IN EVERY OTHER POCKET WITHOUT FINDING ANOTHER KEY
I DON'T SEE WHAT ELSE YOU CAN DO AUNT SAID ALICE WHEN THE LETTER WAS READ AND THIS POOR CREATURE IS SO WEAK THAT I DO NOT THINK HE WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK MUCH FOR A FEW DAYS
AS THAT WOULD SEEM A NATURAL THING FOR HIM TO DO THE MEREST SUSPICION THAT BERNARD WAS ALIVE AND IN HIDING WOULD SET THE BLOODHOUNDS OF THE LAW ON THE TRAIL AND BERYL WOULD BE THE FIRST TO LOOSEN THEM THEREFORE ALICE WAITED AT HOME WITH MISS BERENGARIA
I DON'T THINK GORE IS THE MAN TO BE CONTROLLED SAID DURHAM SAGELY YOU DON'T KNOW HE IS YOUNG AFTER ALL BUT YOU KNOW BY THE WILL I HAVE
WON'T YOU TAKE HIM BACK INTO FAVOR AND TELL HIM
ABOUT THE TIME I CAME MUTTERED BERNARD MISSUS GILROY AS APPEARED FROM THE DIARY RAN UP TO SEE IF THE MASTER WAS ALL RIGHT SHE FOUND HIM STRANGLED AND WITH THE HANDKERCHIEFS TIED OVER HIS MOUTH AND ROUND HIS NECK THEN SHE RAN OUT AND FOUND GORE AT THE DOOR
YES I WISH JULIUS BERYL TO COMMIT HIMSELF BEYOND RECALL WHAT WILL YOU DO THEN I CAN'T SAY ONE THING AT A TIME WHEN THE WILL IS EXECUTED WE WILL WATCH BERYL'S ATTITUDE
ALL THE SAME SHE RECOGNIZED HIM UNFORTUNATELY THE POOR FELLOW IS TOO FEEBLE TO TELL HER OF THE PERILS HE UNDERWENT SO SHE HAS NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF TALKING MUCH TO HIM
WITH THE NEWS THAT THE FUGITIVE WAS RUNNING TOWARDS HIGH STREET HE'S BOUND TO BE CAUGHT SAID MISSUS GILROY
THE GIPSIES USE IT TO POISON PIGS WHY DO THEY WISH TO POISON PIGS BECAUSE IF THEY KILL A PIG IN THAT WAY THE FARMER TO WHOM IT BELONGS THINKING THE ANIMAL HAS DIED A NATURAL DEATH GIVES IT TO THE GIPSIES AND THEY EAT IT UGH
JULIUS SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WALKED TO THE DOOR THERE HE PAUSED TO UTTER A FINAL INSULTING SPEECH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU INTEND TO MARRY BERNARD OR LORD CONNISTON HE SAID BUT I WISH
MISTER BERYL SUCH A KIND GENTLEMAN MA'AM SAID YOU WOULD HELP ME I WILL SO LONG AS YOU ARE HONEST JERRY THRUST HIS TONGUE IN HIS CHEEK BUT JULIUS ANSWERED
IF I AM INNOCENT WHY DID SHE ACCUSE ME BECAUSE I BELIEVE HER SON IS GUILTY HE LEFT SIR SIMON DEAD MISSUS GILROY FOUND THE BODY KNEW WHAT HAD OCCURRED AND THEN RAN OUT ON HEARING JERRY'S WHISTLE KNOWING SHE WOULD MEET YOU
HE THOUGHT VERY TRULY THAT EVEN MISS BERENGARIA'S NERVES COULD NOT STAND BEING BROUGHT INTO SUCH CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH A PROVEN MURDERER LET ALONE THAT ALICE MIGHT REVEAL THE TRUTH OUT OF SHEER DISGUST BUT THE LETTER PREPARED THE MINDS OF BOTH LADIES FOR THE EXECUTION OF THE WILL
MEANS MISCHIEF I AM TAKING MISTER DURHAM'S ADVICE AND MAKING FRIENDS WITH HIM THAT I MAY THWART HIS PLANS THIS WAS WHISPERED SO SOFTLY THAT LUCY DID NOT OVERHEAR
OUT OF IT STEPPED LUCY AND JULIUS THEY ENTERED THE HALL AND LOOKED AMAZED AS THEY WELL MIGHT
IT WAS NOT THE LAWYER'S BUSINESS TO ARGUE IN THIS ESPECIAL INSTANCE SO HE SPEEDILY SUMMONED A CLERK THE WILL WAS BROUGHT CAREFULLY ENGROSSED ON PARCHMENT AND DURHAM RUSTLED THE GREAT SHEETS AS HE RESUMED HIS SEAT YOU WISH ME TO READ IT ALL
POOR ALICE I WISH BERNARD HAD LIVED
BUT I WISHED TO SET YOUR MIND AT REST MURMURED JERRY LOOKING UP WITH DOVE LIKE EYES I OWE YOU SO MUCH SIR JULIUS SMILED AND PATTING HIS HEAD WALKED ON TO THE DRAWING ROOM IT WAS A VERY PRETTY COMEDY BUT DURHAM WAS NOT TO BE TAKEN IN
HE WAS NATURALLY VERY PLEASED AND WAS VERY ATTENTIVE A COMPLETE REST IS WHAT YOU NEED HE SAID TO MISS RANDOLPH
THINKING HE WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF ENTERING INTO HIS KINGDOM THE LAWYER WAS BY NO MEANS A VINDICTIVE PERSON
ALTHOUGH HE LOATHED HIMSELF FOR DOING SO WHEN THE DOOR CLOSED ON THE ARCH PLOTTER THE SOLICITOR WENT AT ONCE TO WASH HIS HANDS WHAT A COMPLETE SCOUNDREL SAID DURHAM TO HIMSELF AND HOW CONFOUNDEDLY CLEVER
GO TO THE THEATRE AND NOW SHE BROKE DOWN JULIUS SUPPORTED HER TO THE SOFA AND STROVE TO CALM HER IT IS TERRIBLE HE SAID SOOTHINGLY I THINK YOU HAD BETTER GO BACK WITH MISSUS WEBBER NO SHE SAID DRYING HER EYES I WILL WAIT HERE
DON'T BE HARD ON HIM SAID MISS BERENGARIA SUDDENLY I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIM YESTERDAY HE IS DOING VERY WELL IN AMERICA AND WITH THE MONEY BERNARD GAVE HIM HE HAS BOUGHT A FARM ALSO HE HOPES TO MARRY I WONDER WILL HE TELL HIS FUTURE WIFE
AND PURSUER AND GORE IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EFFORTS COULD NOT INCREASE THE DISTANCE BUT HE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BE TAKEN
BUT HIS MIND HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO WORK ON HIS FACE AND THE MASK OF HIS CHILDHOOD FOR HE WAS ONLY THIRTEEN CONCEALED HIS EVIL NATURE SUCCESSFULLY IN A FEW YEARS WHEN HIS PASSIONS WORKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE MASK HIS FACE
I HOPE SO ALSO SAID ALICE FERVENTLY AND SHE REALLY MEANT IT EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS THINKING OF THE YOUNG SCAMP UPSTAIRS JULIUS SHOOK HIS HEAD
TO MARRY CONNISTON EVEN THOUGH HE WAS THE POOREST OF PEERS ONE CAN DO A LOT WITH A TITLE EVEN WITHOUT MONEY AND LUCY WAS WISE IN HER GENERATION MOREOVER SHE WAS TRULY IN LOVE WITH THE YOUNG MAN AND THOUGHT VERY RIGHTLY THAT HE WOULD MAKE HER A GOOD HUSBAND
WE KEPT THE MATTER FROM THEM AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND WITH ALICE I WAITED ON BERNARD MYSELF BUT JERRY TOLD THE SERVANTS AS WELL AS MISTER BERYL WILL THE KNOWLEDGE GO ANY FURTHER SAID THE LAWYER KEEPING UP THE COMEDY I DON'T WANT BERNARD ARRESTED
SUCH TRIUMPHS OF THE FLORICULTURAL ART HAD NEVER BEEN SEEN OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF A FLOWER SHOW THE WEATHER WAS EXCEEDINGLY WARM AND ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY THERE WAS NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY MISS PLANTAGENET POTTERED ABOUT HER GARDEN CLIPPING AND ARRANGING AS USUAL
BESIDES PEOPLE DON'T MURDER NOWADAYS DON'T THEY SAID SIR SIMON LOOK IN THE NEWSPAPERS I MEAN THAT WHAT YOU THINK JULIUS MIGHT DO IS WORTHY OF A NOVEL I DON'T FANCY NOVELS ARE TRUE TO LIFE ANYTHING JULIUS DID
FINALLY HE CONSENTED TO DRAW UP THE WILL AS INSTRUCTED BY THE LETTER AND AGREED TO MEET JULIUS NEXT DAY AT LIVERPOOL STREET STATION TO GO DOWN WITH HIM TO THE HALL JULIUS DREW A LONG BREATH OF RELIEF WHEN THE LAWYER SO AGREED
HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DOUBTED THE FACT OF AUNTY'S AND MY BELIEFS A FEW QUESTIONS FROM ME AND HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPOSED EVEN HAD I TRULY BELIEVED HE WAS BERNARD
HE IS A LAD I WISH YOU TO HELP SAID BERYL BLANDLY LAST TIME WE MET MISS PLANTAGENET YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANTED A PAGE NOT EXACTLY A PAGE SAID THE OLD DAME RUBBING HER NOSE
HUSH HUSH SAID MISS BERENGARIA FOLDING THE CLOTHES ROUND HIM NO MORE OF THIS UNHEALTHY TALK YOU WILL GET WELL WITH DURHAM THEY LEFT THE ROOM WHILE MARIA REMAINED TO ATTEND ON THE PATIENT
I WONDER HOW HE INHERITED SUCH A TAINTED NATURE MISS BERENGARIA SAT UP BRISKLY I CAN TELL YOU SHE SAID MISSUS MOON INFORMED ME THAT HER SON JERRY'S FATHER WAS A DESPERATE SCAMP
AND BERNARD IS VERY QUICK SAID LUCY SIPPING A GLASS OF WINE WHICH SHE SORELY NEEDED OH I HOPE HE'LL GET AWAY VERY NATURAL SAID GROOM NODDING YOU DON'T WANT THE SCANDAL I DON'T WANT BERNARD HANGED SAID MISS RANDOLPH AH
IT STRUCK DURHAM FROM THIS SPEECH THAT JULIUS WAS DOUBTFUL OF THE IDENTITY OF BERNARD WITH THE MAN AT THE BOWER ELSE WHY SHOULD HE MAKE THIS REMARK ABOUT ALICE NOT HAVING HAD TIME TO QUESTION THE SICK MAN SEEING THAT ALICE ALONE COULD PROVE IF HE WERE BERNARD OR NOT
IT'S ALL PLAIN VERY PLAIN SAID GORE EMPHATICALLY A REGULAR TRAP GO ON AFTERWARDS AND SHORTLY BEFORE A QUARTER PAST TEN THERE CAME A RING AT THE DOOR MISSUS GILROY WENT AND THERE SHE FOUND SIGNOR TOLOMEO
THOUGHT BERYL THERE'S NO RELIANCE TO BE PLACED ON HIM I WISH HE OPENED AND SHUT HIS FIST BUT HE WON'T DIE FOR A LONG TIME WHILE JULIUS WAS INDULGING IN THESE THOUGHTS SIR SIMON HAD TAKEN UP THE WILL TO GLANCE OVER IT
OF COURSE I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HER I HOPE HOWEVER SHE WILL REAPPEAR TO CLAIM HER LEGACY THERE MAY BE NO CHANCE FOR ANYONE TO CLAIM LEGACIES FOR A LONG TIME SAID MISS BERENGARIA TARTLY I HOPE BERNARD WILL NOT DIE
BERNARD CAN MARRY MISS MALLESON WHEN I AM DEAD IF HE CHOOSES HE THINKS HE HAS BEEN DISINHERITED YES I TOLD HIM SO
MISS BERENGARIA SHUDDERED I'LL LOOK WELL AFTER MY OWN PIGS SO THE POOR CREATURE KILLED HERSELF WITH THAT DRUG I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS A DRUG SAID DURHAM I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHAT IT IS SHE HINTED THAT I WOULD KNOW WHAT DROWS MEANT BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY
AND THERE IS NO RED WINDOW HERE HAD I DONE THAT TO ATTRACT BERNARD I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD SAID BERYL WITH A SIGNIFICANT EXPRESSION BUT THE FACT REMAINS MISSUS WEBBER SAW THE RED WINDOW YOU DID NOT
HAD GONE TO COVE CASTLE TO SEE BERNARD AND HEAR HIS STORY AND DURHAM SMILED AS HIS EYES RESTED ON THE SMUG FACE OF THE PRESUMED HEIR THERE WAS NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN THE TWO MEN AND JULIUS PRIVATELY DETERMINED THAT
LUCY IF YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT BEGAN BERYL AND THEN RESTRAINED HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT IT IS NO USE OUR QUARRELLING LET ME SHOW YOU THAT I AM NOT SO CARELESS OF OTHERS OR SO HARD HEARTED AS I SEEM TO BE
HE SEEMS TO BE A MOST DELIGHTFUL FELLOW WHAT A DELIGHTFUL SPEECH FOR A LADY SAID BERYL CONNISTON IS A SCAMP I HEARD HE ENLISTED IN THE LANCERS IT SHOWS HOW BRAVE HE IS EVERY MAN WORTH CALLING A MAN
WHAT'S THE USE OF HIS COMING TO LIFE WHEN HE MUST SUFFER FOR HIS CRIME
YES YOU WOULD BE SAID MISS BERENGARIA IRONICALLY AND SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN RASH ENOUGH TO SAY MORE BUT THAT DURHAM INTERVENED I HOPE NONE OF THE SERVANTS KNOW THAT BERNARD IS HERE THEY ALL KNOW BY THIS TIME SAID MISS BERENGARIA CALMLY
FOR CONNISTON WAS ONE OF THOSE IRRESISTIBLE MEN WHO APPEAL TO WOMEN LUCY THOUGHT BUT IT MATTERS LITTLE WHAT SHE THOUGHT ALL SHE KNEW WAS THAT HER ENGAGEMENT TO JULIUS WHICH HAD ALWAYS WEIGHED ON HER CONSCIENCE WAS AT AN END
AS FOR ALICE REMEMBERING THAT BERNARD WAS ALIVE AND WELL SHE FOUND IT HARD TO CONTAIN HER SATISFACTION THAT HE HAD BEEN FAIRLY DEALT WITH EVEN THE THOUGHT OF THE CRIME UNDER THE BAN OF WHICH HE LAY FADED FOR THE MOMENT FROM HER MIND
COME AND SHOW ME WHERE THE POOR MAN IS THIS WAS TO MISSUS GILROY WHO ROSE SLOWLY AND WALKED HEAVILY UP THE STAIRS ARE YOU IN PAIN MISSUS GILROY ASKED JULIUS WHO FOLLOWED YES SHE MUTTERED PRESSING HER HAND TO HER SIDE
PROBABLY HE CAME HERE THIS EVENING AND SAW SIR SIMON IN ANSWER TO THE SIGNAL OF THE RED WINDOW THE RED WINDOW ECHOED LUCY YES YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE SIGNAL THIS EVENING BUT I DID NOT PLACE A LAMP IN ANY WINDOW
I AM MUCH WORRIED OVER IT CONNISTON COMES OVER DAILY TO SEE LUCY RANDOLPH AT THE HALL BUT HE IS SO FEATHER BRAINED A CREATURE THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT ENTRUSTING SUCH A SECRET TO HIM NOR DO I WISH BERNARD TO KNOW WITH HIS IMPETUOSITY
I NEVER DID HAVING BEEN TO SUNDAY SCHOOL YES MA'AM I'M GOING AND JERRY IN ANSWER TO AN IMPERATIVE WAVE OF HIS NEW MISTRESS'S HAND DISAPPEARED MISS BERENGARIA TURNED TO BERYL
ONE MOMENT SAID A PRECISE MAN WHO HAD NOT BEEN MENTIONED IN THE WILL IF YOUNG GORE REALLY IS DEAD WHICH I FOR ONE HOPE IS NOT THE CASE WHO INHERITS THE MONEY
YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN MA'AM MISSUS WEBBER RAN OUT ALSO I AM NOT MISTAKEN WHY SHE STARED UP ALSO THERE IS NONE YET I AM SURE I'LL ASK LUCY AND SHE RAN INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN
I WAS INFORMED BY MISS PLANTAGENET THAT BERNARD HAD SOUGHT REFUGE WITH HER AND I WENT DOWN TO SEE HIM WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME ASKED JULIUS SHARPLY DURHAM SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
FROM YOUR SNARES BUT LUCY DON'T SPEAK TO ME
HAVING MADE USE OF MICHAEL TO BRING ABOUT THE ACCUSATION OF GORE HE NOW USED HIM TO THE VERY LAST TO GET THE MONEY HOWEVER DURHAM KEPT HIS TEMPER UNDER AND PRETENDED TO BELIEVE THAT JULIUS WAS SPEAKING IN ALL GOOD FAITH HE SIMPLY BOWED HIS HEAD
IT IS HARD THAT AT HIS AGE HE SHOULD BE THROWN ON THE WORLD FOR FOR DISOBEDIENCE PUT IN BERYL MEEKLY SIR SIMON CHUCKLED AGAIN YES FOR DISOBEDIENCE
AT YOUR REQUEST SAID JULIUS LOOKING AT HER DIRECTLY FOREARMED AS SHE WAS MISS BERENGARIA WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BERNARD'S SECRET FLUSHED THROUGH HER WITHERED SKIN
WHY SHOULD I HAVE SUMMONED YOU TO ASSIST YOU TO ARREST HIM I DO NOT WISH HIM TO BE ARRESTED SAID JULIUS MILDLY ON THE CONTRARY I WISH THE POOR FELLOW TO DIE IN PEACE TO DIE
SAID DURHAM WHICH I HAD INTENDED TO READ WHEN INTERRUPTED BY MISTER BERYL HE RE OPENED THE PARCHMENT IN IT SIR SIMON LEAVES THE PROPERTY TO CHARITY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ANY LEGACIES THIS IN THE EVENT OF BERNARD GORE MAKING NO WILL
IT IS ADVISABLE THERE SHOULD BE AN INTERVAL BETWEEN THE NEW LIFE AND THE OLD THE NEW LIFE ASKED ALICE FLUSHING HE IS COMING HOME TO BE MARRIED TO YOU SAID DURHAM AND WITH A BULLET IN HIS ARM SIGHED ALICE
MISS PLANTAGENET WANTS A PAGE I FOUND THIS LAD IN LONDON SELLING MATCHES HE WAS A MESSENGER BOY AT A TOBACCONIST CALLED TABERLEY AND LORD CONNISTON GOT HIM TURNED OUT OF THE SITUATION
SHE DETESTED THE YOUNG MAN WITH ALL THE VIRULENCE OF HER HONEST NATURE AND SHE INSISTED ON ALICE COMING ALSO ALTHOUGH THE GIRL WAS UNWILLING THIS AGAIN WAS BY DURHAM'S ADVICE HE WANTED BOTH LADIES TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW MATTERS STOOD
HE IS USUALLY IN MISS PLANTAGENET'S POULTRY YARD AND I RARELY GO ROUND THERE LUCY PAUSED IT IS STRANGE THAT THE BOY SHOULD ACT LIKE THAT I WONDER IF SIR SIMON SENT HIM TO FETCH BERNARD AND ARRANGED THE RED WINDOW AS A SIGN WHICH HOUSE IT WAS
I TELL YOU DURHAM HE IS A VILLAIN OF THE WORST I DON'T TRUST HIM
DURHAM NEARLY UTTERED AN EXCLAMATION FOR ALL OF A SUDDEN THE WHOLE RASCALLY BUSINESS BECAME CLEAR JULIUS KNEW THAT THE MAN AT THE BOWER WAS MICHAEL AND HE WAS PREPARED TO EXTRACT FROM HIM A FORGED WILL IN THE HOPE THAT THE REAL BERNARD WAS DEAD
SAID LUCY COLORING ANGRILY YES I WILL YOU HAVE THE DIARY AND I WANT TO READ IT TO KNOW WHY I DO IT IS NECESSARY THAT YOU SHOULD LEARN ALL THAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT HAVE YOU DISCOVERED WHO KILLED SIR SIMON
SHE SAW THAT SHE HAD GONE TOO FAR AND HAD GIVEN DURHAM AN INKLING AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MICHAEL HAVING MASQUERADED AS BERNARD
AND WITH A GHASTLY WHITE FACE I AM THE HEIR BY A FORMER WILL INTERPOSED DURHAM OR RATHER I SHOULD SAY BY A WILL WHICH SIR SIMON AFTERWARDS DESTROYED
AND FINALLY WHEN LUCY BROKE OFF HER ENGAGEMENT TO BERYL HE TOLD HER OF THE WHEREABOUTS OF BERNARD LUCY WAS OVERWHELMED AND DELIGHTED TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD BE ALIVE AFTER ALL SHE SAID I AM SO PLEASED SO GLAD DEAR BERNARD
PERHAPS THAT IS WHY HE HOLDS HIS TONGUE SAID ALICE RISING BUT WE MUST WAIT AUNT I SUPPOSE WE MUST SAID MISS BERENGARIA DOLEFULLY DRAT THE WHOLE BUSINESS WAS THERE EVER SUCH A COIL WELL THEN AUNT WILL YOU LEAVE IT ALONE CERTAINLY NOT
AND THEN IT DEPENDS UPON HIM WHETHER HE IS HANGED OR PREFERS TO LIVE ABROAD ON A PORTION OF HIS MONEY THE LESSER PORTION I KNOW THE PRICE OF YOUR SILENCE SAID LUCY VEHEMENTLY YOU WILL WANT THE HALL AND A LARGE INCOME
JERRY GRINNED AND DUCKED TOWARDS THE DOOR GOOD BYE JERRY SAID BERYL KINDLY DON'T FORGET ME IF I DO MAY I BE OH NO KIND LADY I MEAN MA'AM I WON'T SWEAR
A TRAP CRIED BERNARD STRUGGLING TO GET FREE I NEVER WAS IN THE HOUSE BEFORE YOU HAVE VISITED IN THE KITCHEN FOR OVER A FORTNIGHT SAID JANE WEEPING COPIOUSLY SOMEONE LIKE ME HAS BUT NOT ME
WHO IS DEAD ASKED THE POLICEMAN WITH PROFESSIONAL STOLIDITY SIR SIMON GORE THIS IS HIS GRANDSON HE HAS STRANGLED HIM IT'S A LIE A LIE CRIED BERNARD VERY PALE
AND FELT HIS LOSS DEEPLY IT WAS HER OUTSPOKEN AFFECTION THAT PROVOKED A QUARREL BETWEEN HER AND JULIUS AND WHICH LED TO THE BREAKING OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT LUCY HAD A HIGH TEMPER WHICH HAD BEEN KEPT IN SUBJECTION DURING THE LIFE OF SIR SIMON
HE ASKED NO SAID BERYL RAISING HIS PALE EYES AND LOOKING AS SAD AS ANY OWL I FEAR HE IS DEAD IN HIS SIN YOU CAN'T BE SURE IF HE DID SIN MISTER BERYL THE JURY THOUGHT SO
HE HAS THE CREDIT FOR BEING A SCAMP BUT I DON'T THINK HE DESERVES IT CAN'T YOU SEE HIM AND SHOW HIM THE DIARY NO I DON'T KNOW HIS WHEREABOUTS HOWEVER DURHAM AT MY REQUEST HAS PUT AN ADVERTISEMENT IN THE PAPERS WHICH MAY BRING HIM TO THE OFFICE
I MUST GO DOWN AND RECEIVE HIS INSTRUCTIONS I HAVE THEM WITH ME SAID JULIUS BRINGING OUT A SEALED LETTER DURHAM INWARDLY BOILING AT THIS RASCALITY
HE IS THE SON OF HIS FATHER AND BAD AS WALTER WAS I LOVED HIM FOR HIS MOTHER'S SAKE AS FOR THE ITALIAN WOMAN MISSUS GORE SHE IS DEAD
IT WOULD SAVE HIM THE TROUBLE OF AN EXPLANATION AND THEN SINCE HE AND THE TWO LADIES AND CONNISTON WERE BENT UPON PROVING BERNARD'S INNOCENCE DURHAM WANTED ALL WHO COULD BE SPARED WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE CONNISTON TO BE PRESENT SO AS TO DAUNT BERNARD'S ENEMIES
NOW HE WILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE FORTUNE AND THE TITLE AND MARRY ALICE YOU FORGET SAID CONNISTON A TRIFLE DRYLY BERNARD HAS YET TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE WE ARE ALL TRYING TO HELP HIM WILL YOU ALSO GIVE A HAND MISS RANDOLPH
TO ROPE ENDS I SUPPOSE AS JERRY WILL COME SAID DURHAM HOWEVER HE IS SAFE FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS IN HIS REFORMATORY WHEN HE COMES OUT WE WILL SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHAT ABOUT YOUR OTHER PROTEGE MISS BERENGARIA MICHAEL GILROY
I SHALL HAVE TO NURSE HIM BACK TO HEALTH BEFORE WE CAN MARRY MISS RANDOLPH WILL BE OCCUPIED IN THE SAME PLEASING TASK WITH CONNISTON REPLIED DURHAM LAZILY AND I ENVY BOTH MY FRIENDS YOU NEEDN'T LAUGHED MISS MALLESON
