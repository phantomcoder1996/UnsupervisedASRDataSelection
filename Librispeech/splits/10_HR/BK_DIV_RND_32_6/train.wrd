BUT THE HARD VENGEFUL HEART OF HER BAFFLED ENEMY
THERE DEAR DON'T DISTRESS YOURSELF ON MY ACCOUNT PERCY IS VERY GOOD NAY HE INTERRUPTED ENERGETICALLY I WILL DISTRESS MYSELF ON YOUR ACCOUNT MY MARGOT LISTEN DEAR I HAVE NOT SPOKEN OF THESE THINGS TO YOU BEFORE
OR FOR THE SOLDIERS WHO EVIDENTLY HAD ALL TAKEN COVER SINCE THE TALL ENGLISHMAN HAD NOT YET APPEARED ON SHE PRESSED FORGETTING THE DEADLY FOE ON HER TRACK RUNNING STUMBLING FOOT SORE
THE HALF DESERTED DINING ROOM THE FATEFUL HOUR CHAUVELIN ON THE WATCH THEN
WHOM FRANCE HAS DRIVEN FROM HER SHORES YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS IS EVER GRACIOUS REPLIED THE COMTESSE WITH BECOMING DIGNITY THEN INDICATING HER DAUGHTER WHO STOOD TIMIDLY BY HER SIDE MY DAUGHTER SUZANNE MONSEIGNEUR SHE SAID
ONE ROOM HAD BEEN SET APART FOR DANCING AND THE DAINTY STRAINS OF THE MINUET MADE A SOFT ACCOMPANIMENT TO THE GAY CHATTER THE MERRY LAUGHTER OF THE NUMEROUS AND BRILLIANT COMPANY IN A SMALLER CHAMBER FACING THE TOP OF THE FINE STAIRWAY
I MUST KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED WHAT HAS HAPPENED DEAR LADY HE SAID WITH AFFECTED SURPRISE WHERE
WHY SHOULD SHE HAVE DONE SUCH A THING SURELY THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE NO MISTAKE IS POSSIBLE MONSIEUR REJOINED THE COMTESSE COLDLY MARGUERITE SAINT JUST'S BROTHER IS A NOTED REPUBLICAN
BUT NOW LITTLE ONE TELL ME WHAT IS THE LATEST NEWS ABOUT YOUR FATHER OH SAID SUZANNE WITH MAD GLEE THE BEST WE COULD POSSIBLY HEAR
STILL SIR ANDREW WAS SILENT YOU DO NOT TRUST ME SHE SAID PASSIONATELY OH GOD CANNOT YOU SEE THAT I AM IN DEADLY EARNEST
BUT NOW SHE REALISED THAT OTHER STEPS QUICKER THAN HER OWN WERE ALREADY CLOSE AT HER HEELS THE NEXT INSTANT A HAND DRAGGED AT HER SKIRT
AND A SOLDIER OF THE REPUBLIC NEVER FORGETS AN ORDER YOU WHO HAVE CREPT UP TO THE HUT WILL TRY TO PEEP INSIDE IF AN ENGLISHMAN IS THERE WITH THOSE TRAITORS A MAN WHO IS TALL ABOVE THE AVERAGE OR WHO STOOPS AS IF HE WOULD DISGUISE HIS HEIGHT
UNEVEN COBBLE STONES AND THE NEXT MOMENT A STABLE BOY HAD THROWN OPEN THE COFFEE ROOM DOOR AND RUSHED IN EXCITEDLY SIR PERCY BLAKENEY AND MY LADY HE SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE THEY'RE JUST ARRIVING
AND KNEW THAT RESERVE WHICH LURKED BEHIND HER FRANK OPEN WAYS THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN TOGETHER THESE TWO
MARGUERITE'S ACHING HEART STOOD STILL SHE FELT MORE THAN SHE HEARD THE MEN ON THE WATCH PREPARING FOR THE FIGHT HER SENSES TOLD HER THAT EACH WITH SWORD IN HAND WAS CROUCHING READY FOR THE SPRING
HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO UTTER THE HISTORIC AND FEROCIOUS DESIRE THAT ARISTOCRATS MIGHT HAVE BUT ONE HEAD BETWEEN THEM SO THAT IT MIGHT BE CUT OFF WITH A SINGLE STROKE OF THE GUILLOTINE
YOU NEED NOT ANSWER IT IF YOU DO NOT WISH HE ADDED AS HE NOTED A SUDDEN HARD LOOK ALMOST OF APPREHENSION DARTING THROUGH HER EYES WHAT IS IT SHE ASKED SIMPLY DOES SIR PERCY BLAKENEY KNOW THAT
SHE SAID TAKING HIS ARM AT THE DOOR OF THE BOX SHE TURNED AND LOOKED STRAIGHT AT CHAUVELIN
WITHIN A FEW MINUTES THEIR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS HAD DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE
CHAPTER SEVEN THE SECRET ORCHARD ONCE OUTSIDE THE NOISY COFFEE ROOM ALONE IN THE DIMLY LIGHTED PASSAGE MARGUERITE BLAKENEY SEEMED TO BREATHE MORE FREELY SHE HEAVED A DEEP SIGH
WHEREVER YOU MAY TRY TO HIDE YOURSELF I CAN FIND YOU AND THAT PUNISHMENT SWIFT SURE AND TERRIBLE WILL SOONER OR LATER OVERTAKE YOU DO YOU HEAR ME BUT YOUR EXCELLENCY I SAID DO YOU HEAR ME
I WONDER NOW SUDDENLY HE PAUSED AFTER A FEW MOMENTS OF DEADLY SILENCE HE GAVE FORTH A LONG LOW CURIOUS CHUCKLE WHILE ONCE AGAIN MARGUERITE FELT WITH A HORRIBLE SHUDDER
SHE SAID IMPATIENTLY YOU MUST SEEK FOR ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY THEN I AM GOING TO LORD GRENVILLE'S BALL TO NIGHT AFTER THE OPERA SO ARE YOU PROBABLY I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES THEN
WENT PRATTLING ON MARGUERITE'S THOUGHTS WENT BACK TO THE EVENTS OF THE PAST NIGHT ARMAND'S PERIL CHAUVELIN'S THREAT HIS CRUEL EITHER OR WHICH SHE HAD ACCEPTED AND THEN HER OWN WORK IN THE MATTER WHICH SHOULD HAVE CULMINATED
TO THE TRIBUNAL THAT ULTIMATELY SENT HIM AND ALL HIS FAMILY TO THE GUILLOTINE YES HE DOES KNOW I TOLD HIM AFTER I MARRIED HIM YOU TOLD HIM ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH SO COMPLETELY EXONERATED YOU FROM ANY BLAME
SHE KNEW FROM OLD EXPERIENCE THAT SIR PERCY WOULD SPEAK LITTLE IF AT ALL HE HAD OFTEN DRIVEN HER ON HIS BEAUTIFUL COACH FOR HOURS AT NIGHT FROM POINT TO POINT WITHOUT MAKING MORE THAN ONE OR TWO CASUAL REMARKS UPON THE WEATHER OR THE STATE OF THE ROADS
BLAKENEY WAS GONE OBVIOUSLY TO TRY AND JOIN THE FUGITIVES AT THE PERE BLANCHARD'S HUT FOR THE MOMENT TRUE CHAUVELIN WAS HELPLESS
PERSECUTED BY THE RELENTLESS REVOLUTIONARY FACTION OF THEIR COUNTRY HAD FOUND A PEACEFUL REFUGE IN ENGLAND
AND BEGAN CHANGING HIS ATTIRE YOU CITOYEN IN THE MEANWHILE HE SAID TO DESGAS
SUDDENLY STARTLED HIM BY ASKING ABRUPTLY LORD
AS SILENTLY LIKE NOISELESS SHADOWS ONE BY ONE THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO CREEP ALONG THE ROUGH AND NARROW FOOTPATH AH YES I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE JEW SAID CHAUVELIN AND TURNING TOWARDS THE JEW
AND STILL LEAVES ME IN IGNORANCE OF THE IDENTITY OF THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL LA MY FRIEND SHE SAID WITH THE SAME ASSUMED FLIPPANCY OF MANNER THEN YOU ARE WHERE YOU WERE BEFORE AREN'T YOU
JUST AS YOU BROUGHT US TO DAY THIS WAS SAID WITH SO MUCH CONFIDENCE SUCH UNUTTERED HOPE AND BELIEF THAT IT SEEMED AS IF BY MAGIC TO DRY THE MOTHER'S EYES AND TO BRING A SMILE UPON EVERYBODY'S LIPS
I MEAN DOES HE KNOW THE PART YOU PLAYED IN THE ARREST OF THE MARQUIS DE SAINT CYR SHE LAUGHED A MIRTHLESS BITTER CONTEMPTUOUS LAUGH WHICH WAS LIKE A JARRING CHORD IN THE MUSIC OF HER VOICE THAT I DENOUNCED THE MARQUIS DE SAINT CYR YOU MEAN
WE WORSHIP HIM WE WEAR HIS BADGE WE TREMBLE FOR HIM WHEN HE IS IN DANGER AND EXULT WITH HIM IN THE HOUR OF HIS VICTORY CHAUVELIN DID NO MORE THAN BOW PLACIDLY BOTH TO THE PRINCE AND TO MARGUERITE
YOU SEEM AILING LADY BLAKENEY I AM ONLY VERY TIRED SHE REPEATED WEARILY AS SHE ALLOWED LORD FANCOURT TO LEAD HER WHERE SUBDUED LIGHTS AND GREEN PLANTS LENT COOLNESS TO THE AIR HE GOT HER A CHAIR
WHO IS SAID TO BE TERRIBLY BITTER AGAINST OUR LEAGUE AND DETERMINED TO DISCOVER THE IDENTITY OF OUR LEADER SO THAT HE MAY HAVE HIM KIDNAPPED THE NEXT TIME HE ATTEMPTS TO SET FOOT IN FRANCE THIS CHAUVELIN HAS BROUGHT A WHOLE ARMY OF SPIES WITH HIM
A DISCREET KNOCK AT THE DOOR ROUSED HER FROM HER ENJOYMENT COME IN SHE SAID WITH SOME IMPATIENCE WITHOUT TURNING TO LOOK AT THE INTRUDER CHAUVELIN WAITING FOR HIS OPPORTUNITY NOTED THAT SHE WAS ALONE
AND HIS SERVANT INTRODUCED HER LADYSHIP IMMEDIATELY SHE WENT UPSTAIRS TO THE YOUNG MAN'S COMFORTABLE BACHELOR'S CHAMBERS AND WAS SHOWN INTO A SMALL THOUGH LUXURIOUSLY FURNISHED DINING ROOM
HE WILL FIND A FAITHFUL ALLY IN LADY BLAKENEY BLESS THE WOMAN EJACULATED LADY PORTARLES DID EVER ANYONE SEE SUCH PERVERSITY
THE VERY CLIFFS ECHOED THE POOR HEART BROKEN WOMAN'S SCREAMS CHAUVELIN WITH A MUTTERED OATH WHICH BODED NO GOOD TO HER WHO HAD DARED TO UPSET HIS MOST CHERISHED PLANS HAD HASTILY SHOUTED THE WORD OF COMMAND INTO IT MY MEN AND LET NO ONE ESCAPE FROM THAT HUT ALIVE
BUT WAS READY TO EFFACE HERSELF SHE KISSED MARGUERITE AGAIN AND AGAIN THEN WALKED SADLY BACK ACROSS THE LAWN MARGUERITE DID NOT MOVE SHE REMAINED THERE THINKING WONDERING WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
HE SAID AT LAST TENTATIVELY OH
LADY PORTARLES WHOSE VOICE AND MANNER WOULD NOT HAVE MISFITTED A JOCKEY HAD A HEART OF GOLD AND HID THE MOST GENUINE SYMPATHY AND MOST GENTLE KINDLINESS BENEATH THE SOMEWHAT COARSE MANNERS AFFECTED BY SOME LADIES AT THAT TIME BESIDES WHICH MADAME ADDED LORD GRENVILLE
AND YOU CAN LET ME ENJOY THE LAST STROPHE OF THE ARIA FAITH SHE ADDED OSTENTATIOUSLY SMOTHERING AN IMAGINARY YAWN HAD YOU NOT SPOKEN ABOUT MY BROTHER I AM COMING TO HIM NOW CITOYENNE AMONG THE PAPERS
EQUALLY FAST ASLEEP IN ANOTHER CORNER HE SAID WHY DOES YOUR LADYSHIP ASK I KNOW NOT I
HER WHOLE BODY STIFFENED AS WITH A GREAT AND FIRM RESOLUTION THIS SHE MEANT TO DO IF GOD GAVE HER WITS AND STRENGTH HER EYES LOST THEIR FIXED LOOK THEY GLOWED WITH INWARD FIRE AT THE THOUGHT OF MEETING HIM AGAIN SO SOON IN THE VERY MIDST OF MOST DEADLY PERILS
AND JUST NOW IT IS THE FASHION TO PULL THE HARE FROM BETWEEN THE TEETH OF THE HOUND AH NO NO NOT SPORT ONLY MONSIEUR YOU HAVE A MORE NOBLE MOTIVE I AM SURE FOR THE GOOD WORK YOU DO FAITH MADAME I WOULD LIKE YOU TO FIND IT THEN
AND UNDOUBTEDLY REACH CALAIS MUCH ABOUT THE SAME TIME ONCE IN CALAIS PERCY WOULD MEET ALL THOSE WHO WERE EAGERLY WAITING FOR THE NOBLE AND BRAVE SCARLET PIMPERNEL WHO HAD COME TO RESCUE THEM FROM HORRIBLE AND UNMERITED DEATH
CHAPTER FIFTEEN DOUBT MARGUERITE BLAKENEY HAD WATCHED THE SLIGHT SABLE CLAD FIGURE OF CHAUVELIN AS HE WORKED HIS WAY THROUGH THE BALL ROOM
WE OUGHT TO WEIGH ANCHOR BEFORE HALF AN HOUR YOUR LADYSHIP REPLIED THE OLD MAN PULLING AT HIS GREY FORELOCK LINKING HER ARM IN HIS MARGUERITE LED HER BROTHER TOWARDS THE CLIFFS
BUT SAINT JUST'S LIFE IS FORFEIT TO HIS COUNTRY IT RESTS WITH YOU TO REDEEM IT I MAY BE POWERLESS TO HELP YOU SHE PLEADED WERE I EVER SO WILLING
THE DISTINGUISHED HOST STOOD READY TO RECEIVE HIS GUESTS DISTINGUISHED MEN BEAUTIFUL WOMEN NOTABILITIES FROM EVERY EUROPEAN COUNTRY HAD ALREADY FILED PAST HIM
ONE OR TWO OF THE MEN WHO HAD RUN AFTER THE FUGITIVES WERE NOW SLOWLY WORKING THEIR WAY UP THE CLIFF ONE OF THEM REACHED CHAUVELIN'S SIDE AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THIS HOPE AROSE IN THE ASTUTE DIPLOMATIST'S HEART
HAD AMUSED THEMSELVES FOR MONTHS IN RISKING THEIR LIVES FOR THE SAKE OF AN INNOCENT FEW PERHAPS HE HAD MEANT TO TELL HER WHEN THEY WERE FIRST MARRIED AND THEN THE STORY OF THE MARQUIS DE SAINT CYR HAD COME TO HIS EARS AND HE HAD SUDDENLY TURNED FROM HER
NOT TO KNOW THAT IF HE FAILED IN GAINING HIS OWN ENDS HE WOULD BE PITILESS SHE FELT COLD
I THINK OF HIM FLYING FOR HIS LIFE HUNTED LIKE A POOR BEAST IN SUCH PERIL AH I SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT HIM I SHOULD NOT HAVE LEFT HIM THE POOR WOMAN HAD COMPLETELY BROKEN DOWN
THE JEW WITH CHARACTERISTIC PATIENCE STOOD HUMBLY ON ONE SIDE LEANING ON THE KNOTTED STAFF HIS GREASY BROAD BRIMMED HAT CASTING A DEEP SHADOW OVER HIS GRIMY FACE WAITING FOR THE NOBLE EXCELLENCY TO DEIGN TO PUT SOME QUESTIONS TO HIM
BUT LAST NIGHT AFTER I LED HIM UNWITTINGLY INTO SUCH DEADLY PERIL IT SUDDENLY FELL FROM MY EYES IF YOU WILL NOT HELP ME SIR ANDREW I WOULD STILL STRIVE TO SAVE MY HUSBAND
EAGERLY ATTENTIVE TO LADY BLAKENEY'S EVERY MOVEMENT HID
NAY YOU SHAME ME MADEMOISELLE REPLIED SIR ANDREW THOUGH MY LIFE IS AT YOUR SERVICE I HAVE BEEN BUT A HUMBLE TOOL IN THE HANDS OF OUR GREAT LEADER WHO ORGANISED AND EFFECTED YOUR ESCAPE HE HAD SPOKEN WITH SO MUCH WARMTH AND VEHEMENCE
I HEARD YOUR HONOUR PROTESTED THE JEW AGAIN WHILE HE TRIED TO DRAW NEARER TO CHAUVELIN AND I SWEAR BY ABRAHAM ISAAC AND JACOB THAT I WOULD OBEY YOUR HONOUR MOST ABSOLUTELY
THE YOUNG MAN'S FACE HAD BECOME ALMOST TRANSFIGURED HIS EYES SHONE WITH ENTHUSIASM HERO WORSHIP LOVE ADMIRATION FOR HIS LEADER SEEMED LITERALLY TO GLOW UPON HIS FACE
HAD JUST BEGUN TO FILTRATE ACROSS THE CHANNEL IN HIS OFFICIAL CAPACITY HE HAD BEEN RECEIVED COURTEOUSLY BY HIS ENGLISH COLLEAGUES MISTER PITT HAD SHAKEN HIM BY THE HAND LORD GRENVILLE HAD ENTERTAINED HIM MORE THAN ONCE
AND NOW YOU HAVE ONE ALL IMPORTANT SECRET EH LITTLE ONE SAID MARGUERITE MERRILY WHICH YOU ARE FORTHWITH GOING TO CONFIDE IN ME NAY YOU NEED NOT BLUSH CHERIE SHE ADDED AS SHE SAW SUZANNE'S PRETTY LITTLE FACE CRIMSON WITH BLUSHES
THAT HE'LL CONCERN HIMSELF LITTLE WITH SUCH DIPLOMACY BEYOND TRYING TO DO MISCHIEF TO ROYALIST REFUGEES TO OUR HEROIC SCARLET PIMPERNEL AND TO THE MEMBERS OF THAT BRAVE LITTLE LEAGUE
I AM SURE SAID THE COMTESSE PURSING UP HER THIN LIPS
I COULD NOT DEMEAN MYSELF BY TRYING TO EXPLAIN AND AND NOW I HAVE THE SATISFACTION ARMAND OF KNOWING THAT THE BIGGEST FOOL IN ENGLAND HAS THE MOST COMPLETE CONTEMPT FOR HIS WIFE
WHY WHEN WE WERE IN THE DEAR OLD CONVENT TOGETHER WE WERE ALWAYS HAPPY WHEN WE WERE ALLOWED TO BE ALONE TOGETHER AND TO TALK SECRETS THE TWO YOUNG GIRLS HAD LINKED THEIR ARMS IN ONE ANOTHER'S AND BEGAN WANDERING ROUND THE GARDEN
AND CHAUVELIN CURSED NATURE CURSED MAN AND WOMAN AND ABOVE ALL HE CURSED ALL LONG LEGGED MEDDLESOME BRITISH ENIGMAS WITH ONE GIGANTIC CURSE THE HOWLS OF THE JEW BEHIND HIM UNDERGOING HIS PUNISHMENT SENT A BALM THROUGH HIS HEART
HE MADE AN EXPRESSIVE GESTURE WHILST HE LAUGHED A LOW EVIL LAUGH WHICH FILLED MARGUERITE'S SOUL WITH SICKENING HORROR
NAY CITOYENNE HE SAID DRILY AND RELENTLESSLY NOT HEEDING THAT DESPAIRING CHILDLIKE APPEAL WHICH MIGHT HAVE MELTED A HEART OF STONE AS LADY BLAKENEY NO ONE SUSPECTS YOU
FOUR DAYS AGO THE TWO YOUNG MEN HAD BEEN IN THE ACT OF READING AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED BY CHAUVELIN'S MINIONS MARGUERITE TOOK IT MECHANICALLY AND STOOPED TO READ IT THERE WERE ONLY TWO LINES WRITTEN IN A DISTORTED
HAVE YOU ANY SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ME YES RATHER MORE PRECISE ONES THAN USUAL IT APPEARS THAT THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT HAVE SENT AN ACCREDITED AGENT OVER TO ENGLAND A MAN NAMED CHAUVELIN
HE WAS IN LONDON THIS MORNING HE WILL BE IN CALAIS PERHAPS TO MORROW WHERE HE WILL MEET PAPA AND THEN AND THEN THE BLOW HAD FALLEN SHE HAD EXPECTED IT ALL ALONG THOUGH SHE HAD TRIED FOR THE LAST HALF HOUR TO DELUDE HERSELF AND TO CHEAT HER FEARS
IT WAS TOO LATE TO TALK OF CIRCUMSTANCES HE HEARD THE STORY FROM OTHER SOURCES MY CONFESSION CAME TOO TARDILY IT SEEMS I COULD NO LONGER PLEAD EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
COVERED WITH MAGNIFICENT DIAMONDS AND RARE GEMS THE GIFT OF THE ADORING HUSBAND WHO SPRAWLED LEISURELY BY HER SIDE MARGUERITE WAS PASSIONATELY FOND OF MUSIC
THE SCENE OF THE GREATEST DISCOMFITURE EVER EXPERIENCED BY A LEADING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AGAINST A ROCK ON A HARD BED OF STONE LAY THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE OF MARGUERITE BLAKENEY
TO COMFORT LOVE AND CHERISH TO CHEAT DEATH PERHAPS AT THE LAST BY MAKING IT SEEM SWEET IF THEY DIED BOTH TOGETHER LOCKED IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS WITH THE SUPREME HAPPINESS OF KNOWING THAT PASSION HAD RESPONDED TO PASSION AND THAT ALL MISUNDERSTANDINGS WERE AT AN END
IN SPITE OF ADVERSE FATE AND OF A CUNNING ENEMY KILLED ALL SENSE OF BODILY PAIN WITHIN HER AND RENDERED HER INSTINCTS DOUBLY ACUTE SHE HEARD NOTHING SAVE THE SOFT AND MEASURED FOOTSTEPS OF PERCY'S ENEMIES ON IN FRONT
AS FAR AS POSSIBLE I PROMISE YOU REMEMBER DEAR I HAVE ONLY YOU
IN THE SMART ORCHESTRA BOXES MANY WELL KNOWN FACES WERE TO BE SEEN MISTER PITT OVERWEIGHTED WITH CARES OF STATE WAS FINDING BRIEF RELAXATION IN TO NIGHT'S MUSICAL TREAT THE PRINCE OF WALES
THEREFORE THIS MORNING THOSE TWO YOUNG GALLANTS FOUND EVERY BAR AND BOLT OPEN IN THAT LONELY HOUSE ON THE DOVER ROAD THEIR JAILERS DISAPPEARED AND TWO GOOD HORSES STANDING READY SADDLED AND TETHERED IN THE YARD
AND HER EYES FILLED WITH HOT TEARS NOT THREE MILES AWAY WITH WHITE SAILS SET A GRACEFUL SCHOONER LAY IN WAIT MARGUERITE HAD GUESSED RATHER THAN RECOGNIZED HER IT WAS THE DAY DREAM
THE JEW AGAIN THOUGHTFULLY RUBBED HIS CHIN
CHAPTER TWENTY THE FRIEND LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR LATER MARGUERITE BURIED IN THOUGHTS SAT INSIDE HER COACH WHICH WAS BEARING HER SWIFTLY TO LONDON SHE HAD TAKEN AN AFFECTIONATE FAREWELL OF LITTLE SUZANNE
AH WELL I SUPPOSE NOW THAT YOU ARE A MARRIED WOMAN YOU WON'T CARE TO TALK SECRETS WITH ME ANY LONGER OH WHAT LOTS AND LOTS OF SECRETS WE USED TO HAVE AT SCHOOL DO YOU REMEMBER SOME WE DID NOT EVEN CONFIDE TO SISTER THERESA OF THE HOLY ANGELS THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A DEAR
WHICH THE EXTRAVAGANT FASHION OF THE TIME DEMANDED AND THEN LAUGHING AND TALKING HAD DISPERSED IN THE BALL RECEPTION AND CARD ROOMS BEYOND NOT FAR FROM LORD GRENVILLE'S ELBOW
AND THE FEW MONTHS OF SEPARATION HAD ALREADY SEEMED TO HAVE BUILT UP A SLIGHT THIN PARTITION BETWEEN BROTHER AND SISTER THE SAME DEEP INTENSE LOVE WAS STILL THERE ON BOTH SIDES BUT EACH NOW SEEMED TO HAVE A SECRET ORCHARD INTO WHICH THE OTHER DARED NOT PENETRATE
THEY SAY IN PARIS THAT EVERY TIME A ROYALIST ESCAPES TO ENGLAND THAT DEVIL
ONE ROLLED AWAY AND HE HAD SOME TROUBLE TO GET IT FOR IT HAD LODGED UNDERNEATH THE DRESSER CHAUVELIN QUIETLY WAITED WHILE THE OLD MAN SCRAMBLED ON THE FLOOR TO FIND THE PIECE OF GOLD WHEN THE JEW WAS AGAIN ON HIS FEET CHAUVELIN SAID
VAGUELY SHE FELT SOMEHOW AS IF HE HELD PERCY'S FATE IN HIS LONG DIRTY HANDS THERE WAS A LONG PAUSE WHILST CHAUVELIN FROWNED IMPATIENTLY AT THE STOOPING FIGURE BEFORE HIM
PEOPLE BEGAN TO TALK UNKINDLY OF THE EFFECT OF HIGH ALTITUDES AND EASTERN ATMOSPHERE ON MINDS AND TEMPERAMENTS UNUSED TO SUCH LUXURIES THE YARKAND MANNER
SEEMS TO HAVE ESCAPED FROM MY MEMORY NOW ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS THAT YOU WERE A NEAR NEIGHBOUR AND A CATTLE PAINTER PRESUMABLY MORE OR LESS FAMILIAR WITH THE SUBJECTS THAT YOU PAINTED
THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS OF COURSE SAID EGBERT PEOPLE WHO REALLY TRY TO INFUSE A BREATH OF REALITY INTO THEIR LETTERS OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT AUNT SUSAN FOR INSTANCE WHO WRITES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE HAM
SHE MAY BE JUST DOZING OFF INTO A MERCIFUL SLEEP AND YOUR OUTCRY WILL WAKEN HER CONSIDERATION FOR OTHERS SHOULD BE THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE OF PEOPLE IN OUR STATION OF LIFE
A WORDSWORTH BOOKLET NEXT CHRISTMAS AND ANOTHER CALENDAR THE CHRISTMAS AFTER WITH THE SAME PROBLEM OF HAVING TO WRITE SUITABLE LETTERS OF THANKFULNESS NO THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO DROP ALL FURTHER ALLUSION TO THE CALENDAR AND SWITCH OFF ON TO SOME OTHER TOPIC BUT WHAT OTHER TOPIC
WHAT TROUBLE DID THEY TAKE TO FIND OUT WHETHER WE READ WORDSWORTH WITH GLADNESS FOR ALL THEY KNEW OR CARED WE MIGHT BE FRANTICALLY EMBEDDED IN THE BELIEF THAT ALL POETRY BEGINS AND ENDS WITH JOHN MASEFIELD AND IT MIGHT INFURIATE OR DEPRESS US TO HAVE A DAILY SAMPLE OF WORDSWORTHIAN PRODUCTS FLUNG AT US
ARE YOU GOING TO WRITE TO MISSUS LUDBERRY OR THE FROPLINSONS TO NEITHER SAID EGBERT DRAWING A STACK OF NOTEPAPER TOWARDS HIM IM GOING TO WRITE TO THE EDITOR OF EVERY ENLIGHTENED AND INFLUENTIAL NEWSPAPER IN THE KINGDOM IM GOING TO SUGGEST THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SORT OF
AND ALL THE BUSY PLACES OF THE FARM SEEMED TO LEAD BY EASY ACCESS INTO ITS WIDE FLAGGED HAVEN WHERE THERE WAS ROOM FOR EVERYTHING AND WHERE MUDDY BOOTS LEFT TRACES THAT WERE EASILY SWEPT AWAY
EMMA USED TO THINK TO HERSELF WHAT GENERATIONS OF GHOST DOGS THERE MUST BE OUT ON THOSE HILLS THAT MARTHA HAD REARED AND FED AND TENDED AND SPOKEN A LAST GOOD BYE WORD TO IN THAT OLD KITCHEN
BUT MARTHA SAT HUDDLED IN A SHRUNKEN BUNCH ON THE WINDOW SEAT
NOT SUCH A GOOD FLAVOUR AS THE ONE YOU SENT LAST YEAR WHICH ITSELF WAS NOT A PARTICULARLY GOOD ONE HAMS ARE NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE IT WOULD BE A PITY TO BE DEPRIVED OF HER CHRISTMAS COMMENTS BUT THAT LOSS WOULD BE SWALLOWED UP IN THE GENERAL GAIN MEANWHILE SAID JANETTA
BOVRIL ADVERTISEMENT THE IMMEDIATELY IMPORTANT QUESTION IS NOT HOW IT GOT IN BUT HOW TO GET IT OUT WONT IT GO SAID ESHLEY IF IT WAS ANXIOUS TO GO SAID ADELA PINGSFORD RATHER ANGRILY
ENTERPRISING AND ADVENTUROUS EDITORS TOOK THEMSELVES AND THEIR STAFFS FURTHER AFIELD THERE WERE SOME UNAVOIDABLE CLASHINGS
BARBARY APES WRECKING A BOUDOIR ESHLEY PRESENTED ADELA PINGSFORD WITH A NEW COPY OF ISRAEL KALISCH AND A COUPLE OF FINELY FLOWERING PLANTS OF
AND THEIR SCARLET COMBS AND THE DRAKES WITH THEIR BOTTLE GREEN HEADS
ONE NEVER KNOWS HOW MUCH OF THOSE PICTURES ARE FAKED ADELA PINGSFORD SAID NOTHING BUT LED THE WAY TO HER GARDEN
THAT THE CHARITABLE CALLED THE CROQUET LAWN AND PUSHED ITS WAY THROUGH THE OPEN FRENCH WINDOW INTO THE MORNING ROOM
STEPPED WITH MUCH PRECAUTION OUT OF THE MORNING ROOM STARED WITH GRAVE INQUIRY AT THE NO LONGER OBTRUSIVE AND PEA STICK THROWING HUMAN AND THEN LUMBERED HEAVILY BUT SWIFTLY OUT OF THE GARDEN
BUT SHE WAS NOT MISTRESS OF THE KITCHEN ON ONE OF THE SHELVES OF AN OLD DRESSER IN COMPANY WITH CHIPPED SAUCE BOATS PEWTER JUGS CHEESE GRATERS AND PAID BILLS RESTED A WORN AND RAGGED BIBLE
WITH GREATER FORTITUDE THAN LATIMER WAS ABLE TO COMMAND A SERIES OF SLAPS DIRECTED AT THE PIGS BODY WERE ACCEPTED MORE AS AN ADDITIONAL AND PLEASING IRRITANT THAN AS A CRITICISM OF CONDUCT OR A HINT TO DESIST
HOW ON EARTH DID THE BOY ACCOUNT TO THE RELATIVES ALL THOSE MONTHS FOR THE NON APPEARANCE
AND MISSUS DURMOT HAD BEEN REASONABLY NEAR THE MARK IN ASSERTING THAT HE WAS WORKING AT HIGH PRESSURE OVER THIS ELECTION THE RESTFUL LULL WHICH HIS HOSTESS ENFORCED ON HIM WAS DECIDEDLY WELCOME AND YET
EMMA WAS CONSCIOUS THAT THE WISH WAS THERE DISOWNED THOUGH IT MIGHT BE LURKING AT THE BACK OF HER MIND SHE FELT THE MEANNESS OF THE WISH COME OVER HER WITH A QUALM OF SELF REPROACH ONE DAY WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE KITCHEN
A GRIN SPREAD OVER HIS GOOD NATURED FEATURES IT DONT LOOK LIKE IT HE SAID NODDING TOWARDS THE YARD EMMA TURNED TO CATCH THE MEANING OF HIS REMARK OLD MARTHA STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF A MOB OF POULTRY
LATIMER SPRINGFIELD WAS A RATHER CHEERLESS OLDISH YOUNG MAN WHO WENT INTO POLITICS SOMEWHAT IN THE SPIRIT IN WHICH OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT GO INTO HALF MOURNING
LOR SIR SHE EXCLAIMED IN UNDISGUISED ASTONISHMENT DO YOU WANT THOSE ANIMALS IN YOUR ROOM WANT THE PIGLING
THE OX HAD FINISHED THE VASE FLOWERS AND THE COVER OF ISRAEL KALISCH AND APPEARED TO BE THINKING OF LEAVING ITS RATHER RESTRICTED QUARTERS ESHLEY NOTICED ITS RESTLESSNESS AND PROMPTLY FLUNG IT SOME BUNCHES OF VIRGINIA CREEPER LEAVES
WITH THE SUNLIGHT FALLING IN DAPPLED PATCHES ON THEIR MOUSE SLEEK COATS ESHLEY HAD CONCEIVED AND EXECUTED A DAINTY PICTURE OF TWO REPOSEFUL MILCH COWS
ONE OF THEM I BELIEVE IS STILL LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE TIGRIS VALLEY
HAD ONCE BEEN A MERRY NOISY CHILD PLAYING ABOUT IN LANES AND HAY LOFTS AND FARMHOUSE GARRETS THAT HAD BEEN EIGHTY ODD YEARS AGO AND NOW SHE WAS JUST A FRAIL OLD BODY COWERING UNDER THE APPROACHING CHILL OF THE DEATH THAT WAS COMING AT LAST TO TAKE HER
AS THE CHIEF OF A KURDISH NOMAD CLAN WOULD TO A JAPANESE TEA SHOP GIRL ESHLEY STOOD VERY NEAR THE GATE WHILE HE STUDIED THE ANIMALS APPEARANCE AND DEMEANOUR ADELA PINGSFORD CONTINUED TO SAY NOTHING
A LIGHT DRIZZLING RAIN WAS FALLING BUT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF ANY INUNDATION SOME HALF HOUR LATER HE MET VERA ON THE WAY TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM
IN A SETTING OF WALNUT TREE AND MEADOW GRASS AND FILTERED SUNBEAM AND THE ROYAL ACADEMY HAD DULY EXPOSED THE SAME ON THE WALLS OF ITS SUMMER EXHIBITION THE ROYAL ACADEMY ENCOURAGES ORDERLY
SUCH WAS HER SWEEPING VERDICT GIVEN WITH ALL A PEASANTS DISTRUST OF THE OUTSIDE WORLD WHEN THE HALF FRIGHTENED CURIOSITY HAD SOMEWHAT FADED AWAY EMMA LADBRUK WAS UNCOMFORTABLY CONSCIOUS OF ANOTHER FEELING TOWARDS THE OLD WOMAN
WHAT COBDENISM MIGHT DO FOR THE CAMEL INDUSTRY RANKS AMONG THE BEST OF THE RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO FREE TRADE LITERATURE WHILE THE VIEWS ON FOREIGN POLICY ENUNCIATED FROM A ROOF IN YARKAND
AND HAVE A THOROUGH RESPITE FROM EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH POLITICS I WONT LET HIM EVEN THINK OF THEM IVE HAD THE PICTURE OF CROMWELL DISSOLVING THE LONG PARLIAMENT TAKEN DOWN FROM THE STAIRCASE AND EVEN THE PORTRAIT
WHO DIVIDED HIS TIME BETWEEN AMATEUR HORSE DEALING RABBIT SHOOTING AND FLIRTING WITH THE FARM MAIDS IM AFRAID OLD MARTHA IS DYING SAID EMMA JIM WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON TO WHOM ONE HAD TO BREAK NEWS GENTLY NONSENSE
METHODICAL HABITS IN ITS CHILDREN ESHLEY HAD PAINTED A SUCCESSFUL AND ACCEPTABLE PICTURE OF CATTLE DROWSING PICTURESQUELY UNDER WALNUT TREES AND AS HE HAD BEGUN SO OF NECESSITY HE WENT ON HIS
OVERWORKED OFFICE BOY WHO WAS THE ONE CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THE EDITORIAL BRAIN AND THE BUSINESS DEPARTMENTS OF THE PAPER SARDONICALLY EXPLAINED THE NEW ALOOFNESS AS THE YARKAND MANNER MOST OF THE REPORTERS
ENTIRE PARTY CAPTURED BY BRIGAND TRIBE ON HOMEWARD JOURNEY QUARTER OF MILLION DEMANDED AS RANSOM BUT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE LESS INFORM GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND FRIENDS
AND STRODE SWIFTLY UP THE GARDEN ESHLEY RAN TO HEAD IT TOWARDS THE GATE BUT ONLY SUCCEEDED IN QUICKENING ITS PACE FROM A WALK TO A LUMBERING TROT
IS JUST AS PERFUNCTORY AND CONVENTIONAL AS THE COUNTERFOIL BUSINESS WOULD BE ONLY TEN TIMES MORE TIRESOME AND BRAIN RACKING YOUR PLAN WOULD CERTAINLY BRING THE IDEAL OF A HAPPY CHRISTMAS A STEP NEARER REALISATION SAID JANETTA
THE FEATHERED COMBATANT HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE WHEN HARD PRESSED TO TAKE REFUGE ON THE BED AND FREELY AVAILED HIMSELF OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THE PIGLING NEVER QUITE SUCCEEDED IN HURLING HIMSELF ON TO THE SAME EMINENCE BUT IT WAS NOT FROM WANT OF TRYING
IN THE TEETH OF THE SPIRITED BIDDING OF THREE MEAT EXTRACT FIRMS FROM THAT MOMENT HIS SUCCESS WAS CONTINUOUS AND ASSURED AND THE ROYAL ACADEMY WAS THANKFUL TWO YEARS LATER TO GIVE A CONSPICUOUS POSITION ON ITS WALLS TO HIS LARGE CANVAS
CATTLE DRIVES ARE NOT IN MY LINE SAID ESHLEY IF I REMEMBER I TOLD YOU SO AT THE OUTSET I QUITE AGREE RETORTED THE LADY PAINTING PRETTY PICTURES OF PRETTY LITTLE COWS IS WHAT YOURE SUITED FOR
SHE HAD SEEN IT ON THE FLOOR TOO WITH A ROTTEN APPLE SQUASHED OVER IT FOR THE FARM HAD CHANGED ITS POLITICS FROM TIME TO TIME MARTHA HAD NEVER BEEN ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER NONE OF THEY HAD EVER DONE THE FARM A STROKE OF GOOD
BIT OF COAST SCENERY BY TUKE TWO OF THE BOYS ARE WEARING YOUR MELTON OVERCOAT I HOPE YOU DONT MIND ITS A NEW OVERCOAT SAID LATIMER WITH EVERY INDICATION OF MINDING DREADFULLY YOULL TAKE
WHAT HAD BEEN A FAIRLY ARDUOUS JOURNEY THE AFORETIME STANDARD OF EXCELLENCE WAS SCARCELY MAINTAINED BUT AT ANY RATE THE GENERAL LINES OF POLICY AND OUTLOOK WERE NOT DEPARTED FROM
THE SELF EFFACEMENT OF THE RETURNED PRESSMEN WAS BEING CARRIED TO A PEDANTIC LENGTH FOREMAN COMPOSITORS ADVERTISEMENT CLERKS AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE NON EDITORIAL STAFF WHO HAD OF COURSE TAKEN NO PART IN THE GREAT TREK
BUT BARNYARD AND RICKYARD ORCHARD AND STABLES AND DAIRY GAVE NO REWARD TO HER SEARCH THEN AS SHE RETRACED HER STEPS TOWARDS THE KITCHEN SHE CAME SUDDENLY ON HER COUSIN YOUNG MISTER JIM AS EVERY ONE CALLED HIM
AN INTELLIGENT AND EFFICIENT OFFICE BOY WAS ALL THAT WAS LEFT IN THE DESERTED HIVE OF EDITORIAL INDUSTRY THAT WAS DOING THINGS RATHER THOROUGHLY WASNT IT SAID THE NEPHEW
WEVE KEPT POLITICS AT ARMS LENGTH ALL THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING MORE THAN THAT WE CANNOT DO THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN SAID VERA BUT SHE SAID IT TO HERSELF
THE NERVOUS EXCITEMENT OF THE CONTEST HAD TOO GREAT A HOLD ON HIM TO BE TOTALLY BANISHED I KNOW HES GOING TO SIT UP HALF THE NIGHT WORKING UP POINTS FOR HIS FINAL SPEECHES SAID MISSUS DURMOT REGRETFULLY HOWEVER
WELL LETS GET ON WITH THE LETTER OF THANKS SAID EGBERT PROCEED SAID JANETTA HOW CLEVER OF YOU TO GUESS THAT WORDSWORTH IS OUR FAVOURITE POET DICTATED EGBERT AGAIN JANETTA LAID DOWN HER PEN DO YOU REALISE WHAT THAT MEANS SHE ASKED
WHAT HE REALLY WANTS IS A MANS FIRM HAND TO KEEP HIM IN ORDER ID TRY AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM MYSELF ONLY IVE GOT MY CHOW IN MY ROOM YOU KNOW AND HE GOES FOR PIGS WHEREVER HE FINDS THEM COULDNT THE PIG GO
WHEN HIS NEIGHBOUR ADELA PINGSFORD ASSAILED THE OUTER DOOR OF HIS STUDIO WITH LOUD PEREMPTORY KNOCKINGS THERE IS AN OX IN MY GARDEN SHE ANNOUNCED IN EXPLANATION OF THE TEMPESTUOUS INTRUSION AN OX
BRIDGE MARKERS SAID JANETTA IN A CARDBOARD CASE WITH SOME INANITY ABOUT DIGGING FOR FORTUNE WITH A ROYAL SPADE EMBLAZONED ON THE COVER THE MOMENT I SAW IT IN THE SHOP I SAID TO MYSELF FROPLINSONS AND TO THE ATTENDANT HOW MUCH
EVERY CARE OF HARTLEPOOLS WONDER WONT YOU SAID VERA HIS MOTHER TOOK THREE FIRSTS AT BIRMINGHAM
FOR CAVIL AT THE GENUINENESS OF ITS PILGRIMAGE AND IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THE ARRANGEMENTS MADE FOR TRANSMITTING COPY AND CARRYING ON THE USUAL FEATURES OF THE PAPER DURING THE LONG OUTWARD JOURNEY WORKED SMOOTHLY AND WELL
AND PASSED TO THE RABBIT SHOOTING COUSIN AS THE NEXT OF KIN EMMA LADBRUK DRIFTED OUT OF ITS HISTORY AS A BEE THAT HAD WANDERED IN AT AN OPEN WINDOW MIGHT FLIT ITS WAY OUT AGAIN ON A COLD GREY MORNING SHE STOOD WAITING
SPORTING BLUFF AND THE DAMSELS OWN PAPER ALL PITCHED ON KHARTOUM FOR THE SAME WEEK IT WAS PERHAPS A DESIRE TO OUT DISTANCE ALL POSSIBLE COMPETITION THAT INFLUENCED THE MANAGEMENT
HEAVENS IVE JUST REMEMBERED MISSUS STEPHEN LUDBERRY I HAVENT THANKED HER FOR WHAT SHE SENT WHAT DID SHE SEND I FORGET I THINK IT WAS A CALENDAR THERE WAS A LONG SILENCE
ON WHOSE FRONT PAGE WAS THE RECORD IN FADED INK OF A BAPTISM DATED NINETY FOUR YEARS AGO MARTHA CRALE WAS THE NAME WRITTEN ON THAT YELLOW PAGE THE YELLOW WRINKLED OLD DAME WHO HOBBLED AND MUTTERED ABOUT THE KITCHEN
ALL THE SAME ESHLEY FANCIED THAT THE BEGINNINGS OF A HUNTED LOOK HAD COME INTO ITS EYES A LOOK THAT COUNSELLED RESPECT HE DISCONTINUED HIS ATTEMPT TO INTERFERE WITH ITS CHOICE OF SURROUNDINGS MISTER ESHLEY SAID ADELA
OF COURSE I HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT SAID EGBERT EVERY PRESENT THAT WAS SENT OFF WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY A TICKET BEARING THE DATE OF DISPATCH AND THE SIGNATURE OF THE SENDER
DEFINITE AND DRASTIC MUST BE DONE A DEPUTATION CONSISTING OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE FOREIGN SECRETARY FOUR LEADING FINANCIERS AND A WELL KNOWN NONCONFORMIST DIVINE MADE ITS WAY TO THE OFFICES OF THE PAPER
IF MISS VERAS DOG SEES THAT PIG EXCLAIMED THE MAID AND HURRIED OFF TO AVERT SUCH A CATASTROPHE A COLD SUSPICION WAS STEALING OVER LATIMERS MIND HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND DREW UP THE BLIND
SHOO VARIETY IF THE OX HEARD THEM IT GAVE NO OUTWARD INDICATION OF THE FACT
HIS REMARKABLE PICTURE OX IN A MORNING ROOM LATE AUTUMN WAS ONE OF THE SENSATIONS AND SUCCESSES OF THE NEXT PARIS SALON AND WHEN IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXHIBITED AT MUNICH IT WAS BOUGHT BY THE BAVARIAN GOVERNMENT
THERE WAS AN UNSPOKEN WISH IN THOSE WORDS A WISH WHICH WAS UNCONFESSED AS WELL AS UNSPOKEN EMMA LADBRUK WAS THE MISTRESS OF THE FARM JOINTLY WITH HER HUSBAND SHE MIGHT HAVE HER SAY AND TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HER WAY IN ORDERING ITS AFFAIRS
I THOUGHT HE WAS IN THE THROES OF AN ELECTION REMARKED HER HUSBAND EXACTLY THE POLL IS ON WEDNESDAY AND THE POOR MAN WILL HAVE WORKED HIMSELF TO A SHADOW BY THAT TIME IMAGINE WHAT ELECTIONEERING MUST BE LIKE IN THIS AWFUL SOAKING RAIN
BUT HE FOUND HIMSELF MORE OFTEN WONDERING HOW MANY BOY SCOUTS WERE SHARING HIS MELTON OVERCOAT
SOUNDS DELIGHTFULLY SIMPLE SAID JANETTA WISTFULLY BUT PEOPLE WOULD CONSIDER IT TOO CUT AND DRIED TOO PERFUNCTORY IT IS NOT A BIT MORE PERFUNCTORY THAN THE PRESENT SYSTEM SAID EGBERT
I DIDNT KNOW THERE WAS A RESERVOIR AT BRINKLEY SAID LATIMER WELL THERE ISNT NOW ITS JOLLY WELL ALL OVER THE PLACE AND AS WE STAND PARTICULARLY LOW WERE THE CENTRE OF AN INLAND SEA JUST AT PRESENT YOU SEE THE RIVER HAS OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS AS WELL

SIR LULWORTH QUAYNE WAS MAKING A LEISURELY PROGRESS THROUGH THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETYS GARDENS IN COMPANY WITH HIS NEPHEW RECENTLY RETURNED FROM MEXICO
OF A BEE WANDERING IN AT A WINDOW ON A SUMMERS DAY USED AT FIRST TO WATCH HER WITH A KIND OF FRIGHTENED CURIOSITY SHE WAS SO OLD AND SO MUCH A PART OF THE PLACE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO THINK OF HER EXACTLY AS A LIVING THING OLD SHEP
WHEN HE SAID NINEPENCE I GAVE HIM THEIR ADDRESS JABBED OUR CARD IN PAID TENPENCE OR ELEVENPENCE TO COVER THE POSTAGE AND THANKED HEAVEN WITH LESS SINCERITY AND INFINITELY MORE TROUBLE THEY EVENTUALLY THANKED ME THE FROPLINSONS DONT PLAY BRIDGE SAID EGBERT
I HADNT THOUGHT OF THAT BUT
HELL PROBABLY ROOST ON THE RAIL AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BED
BEFORE HE HAD TIME TO ANSWER A MUCH ENCUMBERED VERA BURST INTO THE ROOM WITH THE QUESTION I SAY CAN I LEAVE THESE HERE THESE WERE A SMALL BLACK PIG AND A LUSTY SPECIMEN OF BLACK RED GAMECOCK
IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT MUCH COULD BE DONE FOR HER BUT EMMA HASTENED AWAY TO GET ASSISTANCE AND COUNSEL HER HUSBAND SHE KNEW WAS DOWN AT A TREE FELLING SOME LITTLE DISTANCE OFF BUT SHE MIGHT FIND SOME OTHER INTELLIGENT SOUL WHO KNEW THE OLD WOMAN BETTER THAN SHE DID
LATIMER WAS MODERATELY FOND OF ANIMALS AND PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN SMALL LIVESTOCK REARING FROM THE ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW IN FACT ONE OF THE PAMPHLETS ON WHICH HE WAS AT THAT MOMENT ENGAGED WARMLY
HE OBSERVED IS THE SUDDEN IMPULSE TO TREK AND MIGRATE THAT BREAKS OUT NOW AND AGAIN FOR NO APPARENT REASON IN COMMUNITIES OF HITHERTO STAY AT HOME ANIMALS IN HUMAN AFFAIRS THE SAME PHENOMENON IS OCCASIONALLY NOTICEABLE SAID SIR LULWORTH
IN COMPARISON WITH THE OX A HUGE MOTTLED BRUTE DULL RED ABOUT THE HEAD AND SHOULDERS PASSING TO DIRTY WHITE ON THE FLANKS AND HIND QUARTERS WITH SHAGGY EARS AND LARGE BLOOD SHOT EYES
NO SAID JANETTA WITH A NOTE OF TIRED DEFIANCE IN HER VOICE IVE WRITTEN ELEVEN LETTERS TO DAY EXPRESSING SURPRISE AND GRATITUDE FOR SUNDRY UNMERITED GIFTS BUT I HAVENT WRITTEN TO THE FROPLINSONS SOME ONE WILL HAVE TO WRITE TO THEM SAID EGBERT
OR COMMUNICATION THAT DOES NOT DEAL WITH THE NECESSARY EVENTS OF THE MOMENT ANSWERS TO INVITATIONS ARRANGEMENTS ABOUT TRAINS RENEWAL OF CLUB SUBSCRIPTIONS AND OF COURSE ALL THE ORDINARY EVERYDAY AFFAIRS OF BUSINESS SICKNESS
A CATTLE PAINTER BY FORCE OF ENVIRONMENT
YES BUT THAT QUOTATION JESSE SAT UP WHAT QUOTATION YOU KNOW HE WHO IS NOT WITH ME IS AGAINST ME WELL WHAT ABOUT IT JESSE WAS PUZZLED BUT NOT ALARMED WELL YOU SAY HERE LET ME SEE
OH WHAT YOUNG EXTRAVAGANT GOD WHO WOULD KNOW OR ASK IT
NEVER ANY MORE DID HE REPROACH HIMSELF FOR FEELINGS THAT WERE NATURAL AND SINCERE HE ACCEPTED ALL HIS REACTIONS AS A PART OF HIM UNCHANGEABLE UNMORAL THIS PROBLEM OF POVERTY TRANSFORMED MAGNIFIED ATTACHED TO SOME GRANDER
REALLY THEY ARE THE ONLY THINGS I CAN DO QUESTION BE DEFINITE
OFTEN AMORY MET WIVES WHOM HE HAD KNOWN AS DEBUTANTES AND LOOKING INTENTLY AT THEM IMAGINED THAT HE FOUND SOMETHING IN THEIR FACES WHICH SAID OH IF I COULD ONLY HAVE GOTTEN YOU OH THE ENORMOUS CONCEIT OF THE MAN
AND I LOVE YOU ANY LATENT GREATNESS THAT I'VE GOT IS OH I CAN'T TALK BUT CLARA IF I COME BACK IN TWO YEARS IN A POSITION TO MARRY YOU SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NO SHE SAID I'D NEVER MARRY AGAIN
OH MODERATELY WELL BURNE'S A DAMN GOOD TALKER AND SO OBVIOUSLY SINCERE THAT YOU CAN'T GET ANYWHERE WITH HIM IT'S SO EVIDENT THAT RESIGNING FROM HIS CLUB MEANS SO MUCH MORE TO HIM THAN PREVENTING IT DOES TO US THAT I FELT FUTILE WHEN I ARGUED
BUT THIS FAD OF POPULAR PREACHERS RISING ON THEIR TOES IN SIMULATED VIRILITY
YET THINK OF THE PREPONDERANT NUMBER OF BRUNETTES IN THE RACE PEOPLE UNCONSCIOUSLY ADMIT IT SAID AMORY YOU'LL NOTICE A BLOND PERSON IS EXPECTED TO TALK IF A BLOND GIRL DOESN'T TALK WE CALL HER A DOLL IF A LIGHT HAIRED MAN IS SILENT HE'S CONSIDERED STUPID
FOR IN HIS DREAM SHE HAD BEEN A SILLY FLAXEN CLARA
FIRST ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS AM I PAINFULLY CONCEITED WELL NO YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS VANITY BUT IT'LL AMUSE THE PEOPLE WHO NOTICE ITS PREPONDERANCE I SEE
AND WAS EVEN ACCUSED OF BECOMING A SNOB BUT AMORY KNEW IT WAS NOTHING OF THE SORT AND ONCE WHEN BURNE PASSED HIM FOUR FEET OFF ABSOLUTELY UNSEEINGLY HIS MIND A THOUSAND MILES AWAY AMORY ALMOST CHOKED WITH THE ROMANTIC JOY OF WATCHING HIM
FIRST AND PARTLY BY ACCIDENT THEY STRUCK ON CERTAIN BOOKS A DEFINITE TYPE OF BIOGRAPHICAL NOVEL THAT AMORY CHRISTENED QUEST BOOKS IN THE QUEST BOOK
MY DEAR BOY THERE'S YOUR BIG MISTAKE THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WILL POWER
IT'S A BAD TIME TO ADMIT IT PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO THINK HE'S ODD HE'S WAY OVER THEIR HEADS
OH DON'T TRY TO ACT BURNE THE MYSTIC TO ME AMORY LOOKED UP INNOCENTLY WHAT WHAT MIMICKED ALEC ARE YOU TRYING TO READ YOURSELF INTO A RHAPSODY WITH LET'S SEE THE BOOK
BECOMING REALLY INSINCERE CALLING MYSELF NOT SUCH A BAD FELLOW THINKING I REGRETTED MY LOST YOUTH WHEN I ONLY ENVY THE DELIGHTS OF LOSING IT
IN POLITICS AND BUSINESS ONE FOUND HIM AND AMONG THE OLD STATESMEN AND KINGS AND GENERALS
THE SILENCE OF THE THEATRE BEHIND HIM ENDED WITH A CURIOUS SNAPPING SOUND FOLLOWED BY THE HEAVY ROARING OF A RISING CROWD AND THE INTERLACED CLATTER OF MANY VOICES THE MATINEE WAS OVER
SHE WAS VERY DEVOUT ALWAYS HAD BEEN AND GOD KNOWS WHAT HEIGHTS SHE ATTAINED AND WHAT STRENGTH SHE DREW DOWN TO HERSELF WHEN SHE KNELT AND BENT HER GOLDEN HAIR INTO THE STAINED GLASS LIGHT
DANCING IN MOCKING GLEE BESIDE HIM CLARA'S WAS THE ONLY ADVICE HE EVER ASKED WITHOUT DICTATING THE ANSWER HIMSELF EXCEPT PERHAPS IN HIS TALKS WITH MONSIGNOR DARCY
OVER HER GRAY AND VELVET DRESS UNDER HER MOLTEN BEATEN HAIR COLOR OF ROSE IN MOCK DISTRESS FLUSHES AND FADES AND MAKES HER FAIR FILLS THE AIR FROM HER TO HIM
THAT DEPRESSED HIM WITH ITS HEAVY ODOR COMPOUNDED OF THE TOBACCO SMELL OF THE MEN AND THE FETID SENSUOUSNESS OF STALE POWDER ON WOMEN AFTER THE THICK CROWD CAME ANOTHER SCATTERING A STRAY HALF DOZEN A MAN ON CRUTCHES
AND DANGER IT WAS AN ATMOSPHERE WHEREIN BIRTH AND MARRIAGE AND DEATH WERE LOATHSOME SECRET THINGS HE REMEMBERED ONE DAY IN THE SUBWAY WHEN A DELIVERY BOY HAD BROUGHT IN A GREAT FUNERAL WREATH OF FRESH FLOWERS
SMILING A REPERTOIRE WHILE THE POOR PLAY REACHED ME AS A FAINT RIPPLE REACHES SHORE YAWNING AND WONDERING AN EVENING THROUGH I WATCH ALONE AND CHATTERINGS OF COURSE SPOIL THE ONE SCENE WHICH
THAT I HAVE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS TO MY NAME QUESTION
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO VIOLENTLY DISAPPROVE OF BURNE'S RADICALISM ARE DISTINCTLY THE PHARISEE CLASS I MEAN THEY'RE THE BEST EDUCATED MEN IN COLLEGE
MORE DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE MIGHT SOME DAY EVEN BE HIS PROBLEM AT PRESENT IT ROUSED ONLY HIS PROFOUND DISTASTE HE WALKED OVER TO FIFTH AVENUE DODGING THE BLIND BLACK MENACE OF UMBRELLAS AND STANDING IN FRONT OF DELMONICO'S HAILED AN AUTO BUS
BUT IT DOES REPRESENT SUCCESS HERE IN A GENERAL WAY WELL I SUPPOSE ONLY ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PER CENT OF EVERY CLASS HERE ARE BLONDS ARE REALLY LIGHT YET TWO THIRDS OF EVERY SENIOR COUNCIL ARE LIGHT WE LOOKED AT PICTURES OF TEN YEARS OF THEM MIND YOU
HOW ABOUT YOU TOM TOM NODDED SHEEPISHLY WELL CONTINUED BURNE
BURNE OPENED THE PAPER AND READ HE WHO IS NOT WITH ME IS AGAINST ME AS THAT GENTLEMAN SAID WHO WAS NOTORIOUSLY CAPABLE OF ONLY COARSE DISTINCTIONS AND PUERILE GENERALITIES WHAT OF IT FERRENBY BEGAN TO LOOK ALARMED
A PHOTOGRAPHIC COLLECTION OF HEAVILY BEARDED SHAGGY CELEBRITIES TOLSTOI WHITMAN CARPENTER AND OTHERS AREN'T THEY WONDERFUL AMORY TRIED POLITELY TO APPRECIATE THEM AND GAVE UP LAUGHINGLY BURNE
WILD OF COURSE EVERY ONE'S BEEN SITTING AND ARGUING AND SWEARING AND GETTING MAD AND GETTING SENTIMENTAL AND GETTING BRUTAL IT'S THE SAME AT ALL THE CLUBS I'VE BEEN THE ROUNDS THEY GET ONE OF THE RADICALS IN THE CORNER AND FIRE QUESTIONS AT HIM
NONE I'VE NO MORE VIRTUE TO LOSE JUST AS A COOLING POT GIVES OFF HEAT SO ALL THROUGH YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE WE GIVE OFF CALORIES OF VIRTUE THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED INGENUOUSNESS QUESTION AN INTERESTING IDEA
DOVETAILED SO COMPLETELY WITH EVERYTHING THEY HAD THOUGHT THAT THEY QUESTIONED RATHER THAN ARGUED AND ENVIED THE SANITY THAT ENABLED THIS MAN TO STAND OUT SO AGAINST ALL TRADITIONS THEN AMORY BRANCHED OFF AND FOUND THAT BURNE WAS DEEP IN OTHER THINGS AS WELL
HELLO AMORY HELLO TOM AMORY ROSE EVENING BURNE DON'T MIND IF I SEEM TO RUSH I'M GOING TO RENWICK'S BURNE TURNED TO HIM QUICKLY
AND THE JOY OF YOUTH FILLED HIS SOUL SO THAT HE FELT HE MUST SPEAK I THINK HE SAID AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED THAT IF I LOST FAITH IN YOU I'D
FINALLY THE RATTLING BANG OF FOLDING SEATS INSIDE ANNOUNCED THAT THE USHERS WERE AT WORK NEW YORK SEEMED NOT SO MUCH AWAKENING AS TURNING OVER IN ITS BED PALLID MEN RUSHED BY PINCHING TOGETHER THEIR COAT COLLARS
DID THEIR FRIENDSHIP COMMENCE HEARD THE LATEST SAID TOM
AND LET IT LOOK OUT AT ME I LET IT PLAY STRAY DOG OR ESCAPED CONVICT OR GHOST AND THEN SAW MYSELF COMING ALONG THE ROAD THAT MADE IT ALL RIGHT AS IT ALWAYS MAKES EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT TO PROJECT YOURSELF COMPLETELY INTO ANOTHER'S PLACE
THE BLITHESOME PHYLLIS BORE HER TWENTY FIVE SUMMERS GAYLY FROM THE TRAIN BUT ON THE PLATFORM A GHASTLY SIGHT MET HER EYES
THEY TALKED UNTIL THREE FROM BIOLOGY TO ORGANIZED RELIGION AND WHEN AMORY CREPT SHIVERING INTO BED
AND GIGANTIC PADDED SHOULDERS ON THEIR HEADS WERE RAKISH COLLEGE HATS PINNED UP IN FRONT AND SPORTING BRIGHT ORANGE AND BLACK BANDS WHILE FROM THEIR CELLULOID COLLARS BLOSSOMED FLAMING ORANGE TIES THEY WORE BLACK ARM BANDS WITH ORANGE P'S AND CARRIED CANES FLYING PRINCETON PENNANTS
IN THE STREET THE LAMPS OF THE TAXI CABS SENT OUT GLISTENING SHEENS ALONG THE ALREADY BLACK PAVEMENT THE UNWELCOME NOVEMBER RAIN HAD PERVERSELY STOLEN THE DAY'S LAST HOUR AND PAWNED IT WITH THAT ANCIENT FENCE THE NIGHT
THINKS UP A MILLION REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD STAY SO YOUR DECISION WHEN IT COMES ISN'T TRUE IT'S BIASSED YES OBJECTED AMORY BUT ISN'T IT LACK OF WILL POWER TO LET MY IMAGINATION SHINNY ON THE WRONG SIDE
I HATE THE DARK AMORY OBJECTED I DIDN'T USE TO EXCEPT WHEN I WAS PARTICULARLY IMAGINATIVE BUT NOW I REALLY DO I'M A REGULAR FOOL ABOUT IT THAT'S USELESS YOU KNOW QUITE POSSIBLY
HE THOUGHT CYNICALLY HOW COMPLETELY HE WAS LACKING IN ALL HUMAN SYMPATHY O HENRY HAD FOUND IN THESE PEOPLE ROMANCE PATHOS LOVE HATE AMORY SAW ONLY COARSENESS PHYSICAL FILTH AND STUPIDITY HE MADE NO SELF ACCUSATIONS
I'LL SUE THE STEAMBOAT COMPANY BEATRICE SAID AND MY UNCLE HAS A QUARTER INTEREST DID BEATRICE GO TO HEAVEN PROBABLY NOT HE REPRESENTED BEATRICE'S IMMORTALITY ALSO LOVE AFFAIRS OF NUMEROUS DEAD MEN WHO SURELY HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HIM
MAYBE SHE ANSWERED BUT I THINK NOT I'M NEVER REALLY WILD AND NEVER HAVE BEEN THAT LITTLE OUTBURST WAS PURE SPRING AND YOU ARE TOO SAID HE
NO SOMEBODY FLUNKED OUT OR ANOTHER SHIP SUNK WORSE THAN THAT
TWO AND THREE LOOK ALIKE NO NOT MUCH SEAT DAMP ARE CLOTHES ABSORBING WETNESS FROM SEAT OR SEAT ABSORBING DRYNESS FROM CLOTHES SITTING ON WET SUBSTANCE GAVE APPENDICITIS SO FROGGY PARKER'S MOTHER SAID WELL HE'D HAD IT
AND IT ISN'T A BIT PRIVATE I WISH YOU'D STAY I'D BE GLAD TO
INTO THE QUIET FACES AT ITS EDGE SO SHE CAST HER LIGHTS AND SHADOWS AROUND THE ROOMS THAT HELD HER
NEVER ENTERS THE PHILADELPHIAN SOCIETY HE HAS NO FAITH IN THAT ROT HE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS AND A KIND WORD IN TIME WILL RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THE WORLD MOREOVER HE TAKES A DRINK WHENEVER HE FEELS LIKE IT HE CERTAINLY IS GETTING IN WRONG
BROWSING IN HER LIBRARY AMORY FOUND A TATTERED GRAY BOOK OUT OF WHICH FELL A YELLOW SHEET
BUT CLARA TALKING CLARA TELLING A SLENDER TALE OF A HATPIN AND AN INEBRIATED MAN AND HERSELF
THEY DON'T THEY JUST WANT THE FUN OF EATING IT ALL OVER AGAIN THE MATRON DOESN'T WANT TO REPEAT HER GIRLHOOD SHE WANTS TO REPEAT HER HONEYMOON
BUT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM THEY COULD MAKE THEM SOUND LIKE NOTHING WHATEVER THEY GAVE HER A SORT OF INNOCENT ATTENTION AND THE BEST SMILES MANY OF THEM HAD SMILED FOR LONG THERE WERE FEW TEARS IN CLARA BUT PEOPLE SMILED MISTY EYED AT HER
THIS DIALOGUE MERGED GROTESQUELY INTO HIS MIND'S MOST FAMILIAR STATE A GROTESQUE BLENDING OF DESIRES WORRIES EXTERIOR IMPRESSIONS AND PHYSICAL REACTIONS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVENTH STREET OR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVENTH STREET
BURNE HOLIDAY WAS SO EVIDENTLY DEVELOPING
BUT THAT NIGHT AMORY WAS STRUCK BY BURNE'S INTENSE EARNESTNESS A QUALITY HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ASSOCIATE ONLY WITH THE DREAD STUPIDITY AND BY THE GREAT ENTHUSIASM THAT STRUCK DEAD CHORDS IN HIS HEART
WILD EYED GRAD STUDENTS PRECEPTORS WITH STRANGE THEORIES OF GOD AND GOVERNMENT TO THE CYNICAL AMAZEMENT OF THE SUPERCILIOUS COTTAGE CLUB AS FEBRUARY BECAME SLASHED BY SUN AND MOVED CHEERFULLY INTO MARCH
ONE SIX O'CLOCK NOT A BIT SHE ANSWERED
OH AMORY LOOK AT THAT FOREHEAD ON EMERSON LOOK AT TOLSTOI'S EYES HIS TONE WAS REPROACHFUL AMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD NO CALL THEM REMARKABLE LOOKING
THEN SHE BROKE INTO A RUN AND HER RAISED VOICE FLOATED BACK TO HIM AS HE FOLLOWED MY PRECIOUS BABIES WHICH I MUST GO BACK AND SEE SHE WAS THE ONLY GIRL HE EVER KNEW WITH WHOM HE COULD UNDERSTAND HOW ANOTHER MAN MIGHT BE PREFERRED
QUAINT AND MEDITATIVE CHARM METAMORPHOSED THE STRAY TELEGRAPH BOY INTO A PUCK LIKE CREATURE OF DELIGHTFUL ORIGINALITY AT FIRST THIS QUALITY OF HERS SOMEHOW IRRITATED AMORY HE CONSIDERED HIS OWN UNIQUENESS SUFFICIENT AND IT
BEEN IN HER HUSBAND'S FAMILY FOR YEARS AN ELDERLY AUNT WHO OBJECTED TO HAVING IT SOLD HAD PUT TEN YEARS TAXES WITH A LAWYER AND PRANCED OFF TO HONOLULU LEAVING CLARA TO STRUGGLE WITH THE HEATING PROBLEM AS BEST SHE COULD
AIN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL ENTER A FLOOR WALKER SILENCE TILL HE MOVES FORWARD SMIRKING SOCIETY PERSON AIN'T SHE YEAH BUT POOR NOW I GUESS SO THEY SAY
I'D HAVE COME IN WELL BURNE SAID SUDDENLY AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE WE'RE HALF WAY THROUGH LET'S TURN BACK ON THE RETURN HE LAUNCHED INTO A DISCUSSION OF WILL IT'S THE WHOLE THING HE ASSERTED
SOMEWHERE IN HIS MIND A CONVERSATION BEGAN RATHER RESUMED ITS PLACE IN HIS ATTENTION IT WAS COMPOSED NOT OF TWO VOICES BUT OF ONE WHICH ACTED ALIKE AS QUESTIONER AND ANSWERER QUESTION WELL WHAT'S THE SITUATION ANSWER
YOU'RE A SLAVE A BOUND HELPLESS SLAVE TO ONE THING IN THE WORLD YOUR IMAGINATION YOU CERTAINLY INTEREST ME IF THIS ISN'T BORING YOU GO ON
ABOUT A HUNDRED JUNIORS AND SENIORS RESIGNED FROM THEIR CLUBS IN A FINAL FURY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE CLUBS IN HELPLESSNESS TURNED UPON BURNE THEIR FINEST WEAPON RIDICULE EVERY ONE WHO KNEW HIM LIKED HIM BUT WHAT HE STOOD FOR AND HE BEGAN TO STAND FOR MORE ALL THE TIME
AND ALWAYS THERE WAS THE ECONOMICAL STUFFINESS OF INDOOR WINTER AND THE LONG SUMMERS NIGHTMARES OF PERSPIRATION BETWEEN STICKY ENVELOPING WALLS DIRTY RESTAURANTS WHERE CARELESS TIRED PEOPLE HELPED THEMSELVES TO SUGAR WITH THEIR OWN USED COFFEE SPOONS
TORN BETWEEN HORRIFIED PITY AND RIOTOUS MIRTH AND AS PHYLLIS WITH HER SVELTE JAW DROPPING APPROACHED THE PAIR BENT OVER AND EMITTED A COLLEGE CHEER IN LOUD FAR CARRYING VOICES THOUGHTFULLY ADDING THE NAME PHYLLIS TO THE END
NOT A BIT OF WILL I'M A SLAVE TO MY EMOTIONS TO MY LIKES TO MY HATRED OF BOREDOM TO MOST OF MY DESIRES YOU ARE NOT SHE BROUGHT ONE LITTLE FIST DOWN ONTO THE OTHER
BUT THIS IS THE REAL THING ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'LL GO THROUGH FOR PETE'S SAKE TELL ME MORE ABOUT IT WELL BEGAN TOM
HE WROTE THIS EDITORIAL GOING TO FLAY HIM ALIVE
PROPERTY OF DEAN HOLLISTER BOUGHT AND PAID FOR
IT'S THE ONE DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL I'VE NEVER MET A MAN WHO LED A ROTTEN LIFE AND DIDN'T HAVE A WEAK WILL HOW ABOUT GREAT CRIMINALS THEY'RE USUALLY INSANE IF NOT THEY'RE WEAK THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A STRONG SANE CRIMINAL
APART FROM THE DULL LITERATURE OF FEMALE VIRTUE SORROW LAY LIGHTLY AROUND HER AND WHEN AMORY FOUND HER IN PHILADELPHIA HE THOUGHT HER STEELY BLUE EYES HELD ONLY HAPPINESS A LATENT STRENGTH
AND THE POINT OF ABOLISHING THE CLUBS WAS BROUGHT UP BY SOME ONE EVERYBODY THERE LEAPED AT IT IT HAD BEEN IN EACH ONE'S MIND MORE OR LESS AND IT JUST NEEDED A SPARK TO BRING IT OUT FINE I SWEAR I THINK IT'LL BE MOST ENTERTAINING
WHEN THEN HE SEEMED TO HEAR A VOICE WHISPERING BESIDE HIM A VERY SOFT VIBRANT VOICE OH I'M SUCH A POOR LITTLE FOOL DO TELL ME WHEN I DO WRONG THE SOLUTION CAME IN A FLASH AND HE HAD A
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'LL DO NOR HAVE I MUCH CURIOSITY TO MORROW I'M GOING TO LEAVE NEW YORK FOR GOOD IT'S A BAD TOWN UNLESS YOU'RE ON TOP OF IT QUESTION DO YOU WANT A LOT OF MONEY A
WHAT ACTUAL FACT WHY SPIRIT OF REFORM AND ALL THAT BURNE HOLIDAY IS BEHIND IT THE CLUB PRESIDENTS ARE HOLDING A MEETING TO NIGHT TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND A JOINT MEANS OF COMBATING IT WELL WHAT'S THE IDEA OF THE THING
THAT IT BROUGHT A PICTURE OF CLARA TO HIS MIND OF CLARA ON SUCH A COOL GRAY DAY WITH HER KEEN BLUE EYES STARING OUT TRYING TO SEE HER TRAGEDIES COME MARCHING OVER THE GARDENS OUTSIDE HE ENVIED THAT POEM
A GHOST CAN NEVER GET YOU IN A BEDROOM GO ON S'POSE YOU THINK THERE'S MAYBE A GHOST IN YOUR BEDROOM WHAT MEASURES DO YOU TAKE ON GETTING HOME AT NIGHT DEMANDED AMORY INTERESTED
SOME OF THEM HAD BEEN FRESHMEN AND WILD FRESHMEN WITH AMORY SOME WERE IN THE CLASS BELOW
YOU'RE REALLY HUMBLE AT HEART YOU SINK TO THE THIRD HELL OF DEPRESSION WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE BEEN SLIGHTED IN FACT YOU HAVEN'T MUCH SELF RESPECT CENTRE OF TARGET TWICE CLARA HOW DO YOU DO IT
OLIVER CROMWELL SAID IT DIDN'T HE OR WAS IT WASHINGTON OR ONE OF THE SAINTS GOOD LORD I'VE FORGOTTEN BURNE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER OH JESSE OH GOOD KIND JESSE WHO SAID IT FOR PETE'S SAKE WELL SAID BURNE RECOVERING HIS VOICE
OF COURSE HEALTH COUNTS A HEALTHY MAN HAS TWICE THE CHANCE OF BEING GOOD HE SAID I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU I DON'T BELIEVE IN MUSCULAR CHRISTIANITY I DO I BELIEVE CHRIST HAD GREAT PHYSICAL VIGOR
OWN TASTE THE BEST ISABELLE CLARA ROSALIND ELEANOR WERE ALL AMERICAN ELEANOR WOULD PITCH PROBABLY SOUTHPAW ROSALIND WAS OUTFIELD WONDERFUL HITTER CLARA FIRST BASE MAYBE
AND YET NOT BE IRRITATING TO DISTRACTION SHE DID IT CONSTANTLY WITH SUCH A SERIOUS ENTHUSIASM THAT HE GREW FOND OF WATCHING HER GOLDEN HAIR BENT OVER A BOOK BROW WRINKLED EVER SO LITTLE AT HUNTING HER SENTENCE
THEN I KNEW I WAS THROUGH BEING AFRAID OF THE DARK LORDY AMORY BREATHED
HOW HE LOVED TO DO ANY SORT OF THING WITH CLARA SHOPPING WITH HER WAS A RARE EPICUREAN DREAM IN EVERY STORE WHERE SHE HAD EVER TRADED SHE WAS WHISPERED ABOUT AS THE BEAUTIFUL MISSUS PAGE
NOT NECESSARILY QUESTION WHAT WOULD BE THE TEST OF CORRUPTION
THE BED REQUIRES DIFFERENT TACTICS LET THE BED ALONE AS YOU VALUE YOUR REASON IF THERE IS A GHOST IN THE ROOM AND THAT'S ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE TIME IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNDER THE BED WELL
GRAY CONVENT WALL ON A GRAY DAY AND A GIRL WITH HER CLOAK BLOWN BY THE WIND SITTING ATOP OF IT AND THINKING ABOUT THE MANY COLORED WORLD AS A RULE SUCH SENTIMENT BORED HIM
BURNE WAS DRAWING FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE WORLD ABOUT HIM HE RESIGNED THE VICE PRESIDENCY OF THE SENIOR CLASS AND TOOK TO READING AND WALKING AS ALMOST HIS ONLY PURSUITS HE VOLUNTARILY ATTENDED GRADUATE LECTURES IN PHILOSOPHY AND BIOLOGY
THIS WAS DIVIDED INTO THREE COMPARTMENTS
THEN CAME THE QUESTION OF GALLANTRY AND LOVE AFFAIRS UNDER THIS HEAD ALSO BRAGELONNE HAD MUCH MORE TO HEAR THAN TO TELL HE LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND FANCIED THAT HE DISCOVERED THROUGH
BEFORE THESE MORTAL SPOILS OF THE LAST KING WHO WAS NOT TO BE PLACED BY THE SIDE OF HIS FOREFATHERS UNTIL HIS SUCCESSOR SHOULD TAKE HIS PLACE THERE AND WHO APPEARED TO ABIDE ON THAT SPOT THAT HE MIGHT THUS ADDRESS HUMAN PRIDE
A FREEDOM WHICH HAD FORMERLY CONTRIBUTED SO MUCH TO THAT GOOD UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THEM WHICH GAVE THEM THE NAME OF THE INSEPARABLES FOR DIFFERENT REASONS THIS WAS AN AGREEABLE PROPOSITION TO THEM ALL
THE WAR WILL NOT ONLY BE APPROVED OF BUT DIRECTED BY THE CHURCH AS FOR THE REMISSION OF YOUR SINS WE HAVE THE ARCHBISHOP OF PARIS WHO HAS THE VERY GREATEST POWER AT THE COURT OF ROME AND EVEN THE COADJUTOR
AND READY RIGGED AS IF WAITING TO START THAT IS DOUBTLESS OUR BOAT SAID ATHOS YES REPLIED ARAMIS AND THE SLOOP OUT THERE MAKING READY TO SAIL MUST BE THAT WHICH IS TO TAKE US TO OUR DESTINATION
PENETRATED INTO THE ROOM THROUGH THE WINDOW THE CURTAINS OF WHICH RAOUL HAD NEGLECTED TO CLOSE ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING HE WAS STILL SLEEPING HIS HEAD GRACEFULLY REPOSING ON HIS ARM
REMOUNTED THE STEPS WENT INTO THE CATHEDRAL THERE TO KNEEL DOWN IN THE DARKEST CORNER
YES HIS DEATH BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SEEMLY NOT UPON THE SCAFFOLD WHY SO ASKED MORDAUNT CROMWELL SMILED
DARED SCARCELY SPEAK OF SOME OF THEIR FORMER GOOD DINNERS HE WAS THE FIRST TO PROPOSE THAT THEY SHOULD ALL ASSEMBLE AROUND SOME WELL SPREAD TABLE AND ABANDON THEMSELVES UNRESERVEDLY TO THEIR OWN NATURAL CHARACTER AND MANNERS
SHE WAS YOUNG YOU SAY TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD BEAUTIFUL RAVISHINGLY BLOND YES ABUNDANCE OF HAIR FALLING OVER HER SHOULDERS YES EYES OF AN ADMIRABLE
THE HOST WAS AT HIS DOOR AND EVERYTHING WAS PREPARED BED BANDAGES AND LINT AND A GROOM HAD GONE TO LENS THE NEAREST VILLAGE FOR A DOCTOR EVERYTHING SAID HE TO RAOUL SHALL BE DONE AS YOU DESIRE
TO DINNER SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHAT TIME IS IT THEN EH WHY IT IS AFTER ONE O'CLOCK YOUR HOME IS A PARADISE PORTHOS ONE TAKES NO NOTE OF TIME I FOLLOW YOU THOUGH I AM NOT HUNGRY COME IF ONE CAN'T ALWAYS EAT ONE CAN ALWAYS DRINK
DID YOU SEE NOTHING THERE ASKED THE COUNT I THOUGHT I SAW SAID ONE OF THE SERVANTS HORSEMEN DRESSED IN YELLOW CREEPING ALONG THE BED OF THE STREAM THAT'S IT SAID THE TUTOR
HUSH SAID GRIMAUD HE IS COMING OUT
ASSASSINATED BY SPANIARDS AND WHO IS NOW BEING CONFESSED BY AN AUGUSTINE FRIAR THE OLD EXECUTIONER OF BETHUNE MUTTERED GRIMAUD A MAN BETWEEN FIFTY FIVE AND SIXTY TALL STRONG SWARTHY BLACK HAIR AND BEARD
AS HE FELT SOME SELF REPROACH FOR HIS OWN WANT OF HEART AND HIS AVARICE BUT SUPPLICANTS FOR FAVOR KNOW HOW TO ACCOMMODATE THE EXPRESSION OF THEIR FEATURES
I ABSOLVE YOU CRIED THE PRIEST WITH A LAUGH WHICH MADE THE DYING MAN'S HAIR STAND ON END I ABSOLVE YOU I AM NOT A PRIEST YOU ARE NOT A PRIEST CRIED THE EXECUTIONER
SAID THE WOUNDED MAN COLLECTING ALL HIS FORCES AS IF TO GET UP LET US NOT LOSE TIME IN USELESS WORDS EITHER HELP ME TO GAIN THE NEAREST VILLAGE OR SWEAR TO ME ON YOUR SALVATION THAT YOU WILL SEND ME THE FIRST MONK
I THINK I SHALL SEND HIM TO PARIS SO THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE MOMENT FOR ATTACK HAD ARRIVED SUPPOSE HE SAID WE ROUGHLY CHALK OUT A CAREER FOR THIS YOUNG MAN I WISH TO CONSULT YOU ABOUT SOME THING
THERE WAS MORE ESPECIALLY ONE UPON WHOM THEIR ARRIVAL HAD PRODUCED A DECIDED IMPRESSION THIS MAN WHOM THEY HAD NOTICED FROM THE FIRST FOR THE SAME REASON THEY HAD THEMSELVES BEEN REMARKED BY OTHERS
BUT FOLLOWED BY PROLONGED GROANING WAS HEARD THE THREE LISTENERS LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN ALARM WE MUST SEE WHAT IT IS SAID GRIMAUD IT SOUNDS LIKE THE CRY OF ONE WHO IS BEING MURDERED MURMURED THE HOST
HOLLOA YOUNG PEOPLE STOP THERE SAID THE TUTOR JOINING IN THE CONVERSATION
MADEMOISELLE PAULET MADAME DE CHEVREUSE HE CRITICISED EVERYBODY HUMOROUSLY RAOUL TREMBLED
FOR EVERYTHING IS THERE ANY SIGNAL FOR THE GENERAL RALLY A KNOT OF STRAW IN THE HAT VERY GOOD ADIEU MY LORD
YES SAID PORTHOS LET US BREAK THE DOOR IN AND FALL UPON HIM NO REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN NO NOISE NOW GRIMAUD YOU COME HERE CLIMB UP TO THE WINDOW AGAIN AND TELL US IF MORDAUNT IS ALONE
TO HIM WHO IS CALLED THE COMTE DE LA FERE IT IS I SAID ATHOS AND WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE PERSON GRIMAUD AH EXCLAIMED ATHOS TURNING PALE
AND WHICH SOME ONE HAS TRAMPLED UPON THIS MORNING THESE GARDENERS ARE THE MOST CARELESS PEOPLE IN THE WORLD IN BRINGING THE HORSE OUT TO THE WATER THEY'VE ALLOWED HIM TO WALK OVER THE BORDER D'ARTAGNAN BEGAN TO SMILE
I THE SON OF MILADY I THE MONK I THE SECRETARY AND FRIEND OF CROMWELL I KNOW YOU NOW BOTH YOU AND YOUR COMPANIONS IN THAT BOAT SAT THREE MEN UNQUESTIONABLY BRAVE
HE IS QUITE AWARE THAT THERE ARE TWO GENTLEMEN WHO GREATLY AIDED THE ESCAPE OF MONSIEUR DE BEAUFORT
UNLESS SAID MORDAUNT
NOTHING BUT A PHANTOM TO WHOM HE LENT A SOUL AND YET SO POWERFUL IS MAJESTY AMONGST US THIS MAN HAS NOT EVEN THE HONOR OF A TOMB AT THE FEET OF HIM IN WHOSE SERVICE HIS LIFE WAS WORN AWAY REMEMBER RAOUL THIS
APPROACHED THE QUEEN AND IN A VOICE OF DEEPEST SORROW SAID MADAME PRINCES WHO BY NATURE ARE ABOVE OTHER MEN RECEIVE FROM HEAVEN COURAGE TO SUPPORT
BUT I FEEL AN INDESCRIBABLE HORROR AT THE SIGHT OF YONDER MAN HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A SNAKE RISE UP ON YOUR PATH NEVER ANSWERED DE GUICHE WELL IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME TO DO SO IN OUR BLAISOIS FORESTS
RAOUL WITHOUT DISMOUNTING CALLED TO THE HOST AND ANNOUNCED THAT A WOUNDED MAN WAS ABOUT TO BE BROUGHT TO HIS HOUSE AND BEGGED HIM IN THE MEANTIME TO PREPARE EVERYTHING NEEDFUL HE DESIRED HIM ALSO SHOULD HE KNOW IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
GO GRIMAUD
YOUR BLESSING YOUR HOLINESS BEFORE YOU GO I BESEECH YOU HE CRIED YOUR HOLINESS SAID GONDY MY FRIEND YOU TAKE ME FOR SOME ONE ELSE NO YOUR HOLINESS I TAKE YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE THAT IS TO SAY THE COADJUTOR
AT LEAST IN YOUR OWN NAME IF NOT AS PRIEST THEN AS SON PARDON YOU CRIED THE PRETENDED MONK PARDON YOU PERHAPS GOD WILL PARDON YOU BUT I NEVER FOR PITY'S SAKE SAID THE EXECUTIONER EXTENDING HIS ARMS
BUT CONTINUED TO COMPASSIONATE THE FATE OF CONCINO CONCINI WELL THEN YOUR EMINENCE SAID THE QUEEN BECOMING IMPATIENT WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER
OR THAT HE HAD BEEN FOREWARNED OF THE LIEUTENANT'S VISIT HE COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF M ROCHEFORT
THERE IS NO MULE CRIED HE TO WHOM THIS QUESTION WAS ADDRESSED THE HOST CLASPED HIS HANDS AND LOOKED AROUND HIM SUSPICIOUSLY WHILST GRIMAUD KNIT HIS BROWS AND APPROACHED THE WOUNDED MAN
THE PROOF OF WHICH IS THAT HERE WE ARE
EACH FROM HIS OWN ABODE OR OCCUPATION PORTHOS HAD BEEN TRYING A NEW HORSE D'ARTAGNAN WAS ON GUARD AT THE LOUVRE ARAMIS HAD BEEN TO VISIT ONE OF HIS PENITENTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THE INVITATIONS ARE GIVEN FOR THIS EVENING SAID THE COADJUTOR BUT THE VIOLINS WILL NOT BEGIN TO PLAY UNTIL TO MORROW MORNING
BUT THE PRECAUTION WAS NEEDLESS SHE WAS IN DEEP CONVERSE WITH HER OWN THOUGHTS THEN WHEN DE WINTER ROSE TO TAKE LEAVE
WELL WHY SHOULD NOT WE TOO BELONG TO A PARTY YOU HAD YOUR SECRET AND WE HAD OURS WE DIDN'T EXCHANGE THEM SO MUCH THE BETTER IT PROVES THAT WE KNOW HOW TO KEEP OUR SECRETS I DO NOT REPROACH YOU MONSIEUR SAID D'ARTAGNAN
ALL OF WHICH TOUCHED BUT ONLY PRICKED HIM THE THREE FRIENDS LOOKED ON PANTING AND ASTONISHED
THEIR INTERROGATORIES OF THE PEASANTRY AND THEIR CLOSE INSPECTION OF FACES THEY PROCEEDED THUS TO PERONNE
NOW TO HORSE THAT I MAY SEE YOU DEPART RAOUL OBEYED ADIEU RAOUL SAID THE COUNT ADIEU MY DEAREST BOY ADIEU SIR ADIEU MY BELOVED PROTECTOR
AH SAID MAZARIN TO HIMSELF WHAT A SWEET FACE DOES SHE COME TO BORROW MONEY OF ME AND HE THREW AN UNEASY GLANCE AT HIS STRONG BOX HE EVEN TURNED INSIDE THE BEVEL OF THE MAGNIFICENT DIAMOND RING
AND THOSE WHOM HE RECEIVES WITH A WOODEN LADDER I COULD HAVE SPOKEN OUT WHAT ARE YOU MEDDLING WITH CRIED ARAMIS PALE WITH ANGER SUSPECTING THAT D'ARTAGNAN HAD ACTED AS A SPY ON HIM AND HAD SEEN HIM WITH MADAME DE LONGUEVILLE
MATTER SAID D'ARTAGNAN IS THAT THERE REMAINS NO TRACE OF IT
BUT AS IF FASCINATED AT THE SIGHT OF SOME TERRIBLE OBJECT HIS EYES DILATED AND A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH HIS BODY ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HE LONGED TO BREAK THROUGH THE WALL OF GLASS WHICH SEPARATED HIM FROM HIS ENEMY
IT WAS THOSE VERY TERRIBLE OLD DAYS THAT MADE THE PRESENT SO EXCESSIVELY DELIGHTFUL AND THE BLOW WAS SO GREAT HE RUSHED OUT OVERCOME AND FORGOT TO SHUT THE DOOR THE TWO FRIENDS REMAINED ALONE TO SPEAK OF THE FUTURE AND TO BUILD CASTLES IN THE AIR
IT WILL BE TIME TO THINK ABOUT IT WHEN WE NEXT HALT ONLY HAVE THE GOODNESS SHOULD YOU SEE A CAVALIER WHO MAKES INQUIRIES ABOUT A YOUNG MAN ON A CHESTNUT HORSE FOLLOWED BY A SERVANT TO TELL HIM IN FACT THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ME
AND WHETHER HE IS PREPARING TO GO OUT OR GO TO BED IF HE COMES OUT WE SHALL CATCH HIM IF HE STAYS IN WE WILL BREAK IN THE WINDOW IT IS EASIER AND LESS NOISY THAN THE DOOR GRIMAUD BEGAN TO SCALE THE WALL AGAIN
AND CONSEQUENTLY TO MAKE THE CARDINAL ACQUAINTED WITH THE EMINENT SERVICES WHICH HE D'ARTAGNAN AND HIS FRIEND HAD RENDERED TO THE QUEEN'S PARTY IN THE MORNING THEY WERE INDEED ADMIRABLY RECEIVED BY MAZARIN
REGAINED BY THE HATCHWAY THE DECK OF THE VESSEL AND THIS ROOM HE ASKED POINTING TO THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN THAT'S MY ROOM REPLIED GROSLOW OPEN THE DOOR
THE WALKER WHO DURING THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE TWO FRIENDS HAD PASSED AND REPASSED BEHIND THEM SEVERAL TIMES STOPPED AT THE NAME OF DE WINTER BUT AS HIS FACE BETRAYED NO EMOTION AT MENTION OF THIS NAME IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BY CHANCE HE STOOD SO STILL
SHE IS THE PRETTIEST LITTLE CREATURE IN THE WORLD WITH FLAXEN HAIR BLUE EYES AT ONCE SAUCY AND LANGUISHING
HE IS A PRIEST SAID BRAGELONNE HE HAS WORN THE TONSURE OH THE SCOUNDRELS TO LIFT THEIR HANDS AGAINST A MINISTER OF GOD COME HERE SIR SAID URBAN AN OLD SOLDIER
BUT HAPPILY THERE IS A POSTSCRIPT AND HE READ THAT WELCOME POSTSCRIPT WHICH MADE HIM FORGET THE ABRUPTNESS OF THE LETTER
BUT LET ME SEE HOW WAS IT DONE SPEAK SAID THE MONK IT WAS AT NIGHT A MAN CAME TO ME AND SHOWED ME AN ORDER AND I FOLLOWED HIM FOUR OTHER NOBLEMEN AWAITED ME THEY LED ME AWAY MASKED
AND WE RETURNED TO ASK YOUR ADVICE MY ADVICE IS THIS SAID MONSIEUR D'ARMINGES AND IF NEEDS BE MY WILL THAT WE BEAT A RETREAT
I UNDERSTAND THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE HOUSES
AT SIX O'CLOCK THE CURATE OF SAINT MERRI WAS ANNOUNCED THE COADJUTOR GLANCED RAPIDLY BEHIND AND SAW THAT HE WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER MAN THE CURATE THEN ENTERED FOLLOWED BY PLANCHET YOUR HOLINESS SAID THE CURATE
NO SIR THEY WERE CARRIED OFF INSTANTLY AND HAD NOT EVEN TIME TO TELL ME WHY BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE GONE I FOUND THIS BROKEN SWORD BLADE AS I WAS HELPING TO RAISE TWO DEAD MEN AND FIVE OR SIX WOUNDED ONES TIS STILL A CONSOLATION THAT THEY WERE NOT WOUNDED SAID ARAMIS
OLIVAIN TAKE CARE OF OUR HORSES AND GIVE ME MY SWORD THE TWO GENTLEMEN THEN WENT INTO THE CHURCH
MAZARIN A MAN OF SENSE AND WHOSE FEAR MOREOVER GAVE HIM FORESIGHT LOST NO TIME IN MAKING IDLE AND DANGEROUS JOKES HE WENT OUT AFTER THE COADJUTOR SETTLED HIS ACCOUNT LOCKED UP HIS GOLD
HE OPENED THE CASE AND OFFERED THEM TO THE QUEEN WITH DEEP AND SILENT ANGUISH THE QUEEN STRETCHED OUT HER HAND SEIZED THE RING PRESSED IT CONVULSIVELY TO HER LIPS AND WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO BREATHE A SIGH TO GIVE VENT TO A SOB
EXTENDED HIS HAND WITH THE AIR OF SUPREME COMMAND WHICH CHARACTERIZED HIM ALONE DREW OUT HIS SWORD AND THE SCABBARD AT THE SAME TIME BROKE THE BLADE IN THE SHEATH ON HIS KNEE AND THREW THE PIECES TO HIS RIGHT THEN TURNING TO ARAMIS
WITH SUCH AN ILL BRED FELLOW MADE OUT A LIST AGAINST THE GRAIN AND SENT IT IN THIS LIST THERE WERE THREE CONDITIONS WHICH DISPLEASED MAZARIN
COMMINGES WAS NEAR THE QUEEN WHO WAS QUESTIONING HIM UPON THE DETAILS OF HIS EXPEDITION AND EVERY ONE WAS LISTENING TO HIS ACCOUNT WHEN D'ARTAGNAN AND PORTHOS WERE PERCEIVED AT THE DOOR BEHIND THE CARDINAL
HE DARED NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK AND RAOUL WENT AWAY HIS HEAD UNCOVERED ATHOS REMAINED MOTIONLESS LOOKING AFTER HIM UNTIL HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE STREET THEN THE COUNT THREW THE BRIDLE OF HIS HORSE INTO THE HANDS OF A PEASANT
BUT THAT ACT OF SELF CONTROL EFFECTIVE AS IT WAS DID NOT ESCAPE THE EYES OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS SHE STOPPED ON THE THRESHOLD BREATHED A SIGH AND ADDRESSING THE QUEEN WHY THEN DO YOU ALWAYS WEEP MOTHER WHEN I AM AWAY FROM YOU SHE SAID
D'ARTAGNAN WAS THE FIRST TO RECOVER FROM HIS SURPRISE MORDAUNT HE CRIED AH BY HEAVEN
THEN YOU HAD BETTER COME WITH ME THANK YOU SIR BUT THE WAY BY THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE WOULD TAKE TOO MUCH TIME AND I HAVE NONE TO LOSE
THE FORMER EXECUTIONER OF BETHUNE MURMURED THE YOUNG MONK SHRINKING BACK AND SHOWING ON HIS COUNTENANCE THE FEELING OF REPUGNANCE WHICH HIS PENITENT INSPIRED MONSIEUR D'ARMINGES
MORDAUNT REMEMBERED THAT CROMWELL HAD TOLD HIM HE HAD HAD NO DETAILED ACCOUNT
I UNDERSTAND YOU OR RATHER I AM WRONG GO TO THE PARLIAMENT FOR IT WAS FROM THIS PARLIAMENT THE ENEMY OF MONARCHS THAT THE DAUGHTER OF THE GREAT
AND WHO IS GOING IN THREE MONTHS TO MAKE WAR UPON US IN ORDER THAT HE MAY RETAIN HIS PENSIONS IS THAT THE MASTER WHOM YOU PROPOSE TO ME I THANK YOU D'ARTAGNAN YOU ARE MORE IMPETUOUS THAN YOU WERE
IF MOUSQUETON WERE WITH US OBSERVED ATHOS ON REACHING THE SPOT WHERE THEY HAD HAD A DISPUTE WITH THE PAVIERS HOW HE WOULD TREMBLE AT PASSING THIS
BUT CONTROLLING HIMSELF HE ANSWERED PORT WINE
HE WILL LET YOU INTO THE ROOMS IN HIS TOWER SAID THE CURATE CAPITAL ANSWERED THE MENDICANT THEN SAID THE COADJUTOR THIS EVENING AT TEN O'CLOCK AND IF I AM PLEASED WITH YOU ANOTHER BAG OF FIVE HUNDRED PISTOLES WILL BE AT YOUR DISPOSAL
BY JOVE I AM OF YOUR OPINION BUT FIND ME A BETTER ONE OR GIVE ME THE MEANS OF LIVING
A RATHER THICK WOOD AND WHEN THEY HAD ARRIVED AT A DISTANCE OF A HUNDRED STEPS FROM IT MONSIEUR D'ARMINGES TOOK HIS USUAL PRECAUTIONS AND SENT ON IN ADVANCE THE COUNT'S TWO GROOMS
THE CAPTAIN TOO ACCOMMODATING HE HAD REPORTED TO ARAMIS WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE AND ARAMIS NOT LESS DISTRUSTFUL THAN HE HAD INCREASED HIS SUSPICIONS
MADE HIS HORSE REAR AS THE SHOT WAS FIRED HIS HORSE BOUNDED TO ONE SIDE LOSING ITS FOOTING AND FELL ENTANGLING RAOUL'S LEG UNDER ITS BODY THE SPANIARD SPRANG FORWARD AND SEIZED THE GUN BY ITS MUZZLE
BUT AS AN AMBASSADOR OF FATE POSSIBLY AND IF THAT WERE THE CASE WOULD YOUR HONOR CONDEMN HIS ACTION IT IS NOT FOR ME TO JUDGE IT RESTS BETWEEN HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS GOD BUT IF YOUR HONOR KNEW THIS MAN
ONE GETS TO LIKE WITHOUT KNOWING IT ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL OBJECTS THAT GOD CAUSES TO SPRING FROM THE EARTH WHICH ARE DESPISED IN CITIES I WAS LOOKING ANXIOUSLY FOR SOME IRIS ROOTS I PLANTED HERE CLOSE TO THIS RESERVOIR
I SEEM TO READ YOUR FUTURE DESTINY AS THROUGH A CLOUD IT WILL BE HAPPIER I THINK THAN OURS HAS BEEN DIFFERENT IN YOUR FATE FROM US YOU WILL HAVE A KING WITHOUT A MINISTER WHOM YOU MAY SERVE LOVE RESPECT
BESIDES THE CONFERENCES IMPLIED A TRUCE AND TO ARREST TWO GENTLEMEN EVEN FRONDEURS AT THIS TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ATTACK ON THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE THE TWO FRIENDS MINGLED WITH THE CROWD AND FANCIED THAT EVERY ONE WAS OCCUPIED WITH THE SAME THOUGHT THAT TORMENTED THEM
THEN MOUNTING A STAIRCASE HAD OPENED A DOOR
FOR IT TO BE WELCOME TO YOU NOW NEVER MIND SAID THE COADJUTOR YOU MUST BE WELL AWARE THAT THIS REQUIRES REFLECTION AND HOW MANY HOURS OF REFLECTION DO YOU ASK TWELVE HOURS SIR IS IT TOO LONG
WHO BRING ME FROM HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN ANNE OF AUSTRIA THE VERY LATEST INTELLIGENCE
DID YOU SEE THAT TOM SWIFT SOME ONE WAS HERE LISTENING TO WHAT I SAID PERHAPS IT WAS THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN SHADOWING ME I THINK NOT I GUESS IT WAS ERADICATE SAMPSON A COLORED MAN WHO DOES WORK FOR US SAID TOM IS THAT YOU RAD HE CALLED
AND THEN WHEN ALL WAS IN READINESS HE BEGAN TO CALL HIS HOME STATION HE KNEW THAT EITHER HIS FATHER OR MISTER JACKSON THE ENGINEER COULD RECEIVE THE WIRELESS
HE WAS READY TO SERVE HIS GUESTS BEFORE HE FORWARDED HIS OWN WIRELESS NOTES JUST TELL MY WIFE THAT I'M ENJOYING MYSELF REQUESTED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY FOOTSTOOL BUT THIS IS GREAT WE'RE OFF THE EARTH YET
BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER THE SCIENTIST JUST THEN ANOTHER COMMUNICATION WAS COMING TO HIM BY WIRELESS HE LISTENED INTENTLY FATHER SAYS THE LAD TOLD HIS COMPANIONS THAT ERADICATE ONLY HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE MAN AT THE LAST MOMENT
AND TOM COULD NOT HELP WISHING THAT THE SCIENTIST WOULD KEEP HIS GLOOMY FOREBODINGS TO HIMSELF HOWEVER THE STORM HAD NOT DEVELOPED UP TO NOON WHEN TOM WITH MISTER DAMON'S HELP SERVED A FINE MEAL IN THE DINING ROOM IN THE AFTERNOON THE SPEED OF THE SHIP WAS INCREASED
THAT IF YOU DO HEAR IT YOU WILL BE SO FASCINATED BY IT THAT I AM SURE YOU WILL WANT TO CAST YOUR LOT IN WITH MINE AND AID ME TO GET MY RIGHTS AND SOLVE THE MYSTERY AND I ALSO WANT TO WARN YOU THAT IF YOU DO THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DANGER CONNECTED WITH IT
RISING ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET AND CIRCLING ABOUT SEVERAL TIMES TO TEST THE WIND CURRENTS TOM HEADED HIS CRAFT TOWARD CHESTER A CITY ABOUT FIFTY MILES FROM SHOPTON IN HIS POCKET SNUGLY TUCKED AWAY WERE THE TWO STONES MISTER JENKS HAD GIVEN HIM
HE WAS GLIDING SWIFTLY TOWARD THE EARTH AND WITH THE PLAN IN HIS MIND OF ADMINISTERING SOME SORT OF PUNISHMENT TO THE BULLY HE AIMED THE MACHINE DIRECTLY AT HIM NEARER AND NEARER SHOT THE MONOPLANE AS QUIETLY AS A SHEET OF PAPER MIGHT FALL
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE MOUNTAIN SHATTERED CONCLUSION CAN'T WE GET SOME OF THE DIAMONDS CRIED MISTER DAMON AS HE RACED ALONG BEHIND TOM NOW'S OUR CHANCE
I TALKED WITH THE MAN AND HE MADE A CURIOUS STATEMENT THIS MAN WHO GAVE HIS NAME AS ENOS FOLWELL SAID HE KNEW A PLACE WHERE DIAMONDS COULD BE MADE PARTLY IN A SCIENTIFIC MANNER AND PARTLY BY THE FORCES OF NATURE
SPOKE MISTER JENKS BUT I WOULDN'T STOP EVEN FOR THAT THE STORM IS TOO DANGEROUS CALLED BILL RENSHAW I CAN SHOW YOU A SHORTER WAY OUT
HE TRIED TO WORK ON TOM'S SWIFT'S FEARS AND FRIGHTEN HIM FROM USING HIS AIRSHIP ON THIS QUEST THEN WHEN HE FAILED THE MAN MUST HAVE SNEAKED INTO THE SHED AND HIDDEN HIMSELF IN THE SHIP WE MUST GET RID OF HIM OR HE MAY WRECK THE RED CLOUD
THAT'S SO CRIED TOM WE MUST TRY TO CAPTURE HIM I THINK WE HAD BETTER THE LAD PAUSED AND AGAIN LISTENED TO THE WIRELESS MESSAGE FATHER SAYS ERADICATE SAW THE MAN HAVE A GUN SO WE MUST BE CAREFUL
BUT AFTER I REALIZED THAT I HAD BEEN CHEATED OUT OF MY RIGHTS AND WHEN I BEGAN TO MAKE AN INVESTIGATION WITH A VIEW TO DISCOVERING THEIR SECRET WHEREABOUTS I RECEIVED MYSTERIOUS AND ANONYMOUS WARNINGS TO STOP BUT I DID NOT
AS YOU DOUBTLESS SAW WHEN WE WERE ON THE ISLAND BUT I KNEW I NEEDED AN AIRSHIP IN WHICH TO FLY OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND PICK OUT THE LOCATION OF THE CAVE WHERE THE DIAMONDS ARE MADE BUT HOW CAN YOU LOCATE IT IF YOU WERE BLINDFOLDED WHEN YOU WERE TAKEN THERE MISTER JENKS
I WAS TAKEN INTO A SMALL CHAMBER OF THE CAVE AND THERE SAW QUITE A COMPLICATED APPARATUS PART OF IT WAS A GREAT STEEL BOX WITH A LEVER ON IT WE WILL LET YOU MAKE SOME DIAMONDS FOR YOURSELF FOLWELL SAID TO ME
AND HE DIRECTED ME TO PULL THE LEVER OF THE BOX AT A CERTAIN SIGNAL THE SIGNAL CAME JUST AS A TERRIFIC CRASH OF THUNDER SHOOK THE VERY MOUNTAIN INSIDE OF WHICH WE WERE THE BOX OF STEEL GOT RED HOT AND WHEN IT COOLED OFF IT WAS OPENED
DID ERADICATE SEE THE MAN HE SAYS HE DID ANSWERED TOM THE MAN IS HIDDEN AWAY ON BOARD NOW PROBABLY AMONG THE STORES AND SUPPLIES BLESS MY TOMATO SAUCE EXPLODED MISTER DAMON
THE FIGURE IN WHITE COULD BE SEEN HURRYING BACK UP THE MOUNTAIN TRAIL EVIDENTLY THE ELECTRICAL STORM WITH LIGHTNING BOLTS DISCHARGING SO CLOSE WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE GHOST
WHEN MISTER JENKS COMES TO NIGHT I'LL TELL HIM I'LL HELP HIM TO GET HIS RIGHTS AND DISCOVER THE SECRET OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS AS TOM WAS WHEELING THE BUTTERFLY INTO THE SHED ERADICATE CAME OUT TO HELP HIM DERE'S A GEN'MAN HERE TO SEE YO MASSA TOM
AS THE ELECTRICITY LEAPED FROM THE TRANSMITTERS INTO SPACE THEN HE CLAMPED THE RECEIVER ON HIS EAR ALL READY HE ANNOUNCED HAS ANYBODY ANY MESSAGES THEY WISH SENT FOR WITH THE COURTESY OF A TRUE HOST
SUPPER WAS NEARLY READY WHEN MISTER PARKER RETURNED HIS FACE WORE A RATHER SERIOUS AIR AND MISTER DAMON NOTING IT ASKED LAUGHINGLY WELL
THEN I'LL HELP YOU GET IT OUT BLESS MY FRYING PAN BUT I AM VERY FOND OF LOBSTER EXCLAIMED MISTER DAMON IN AS NATURAL TONES AS WAS POSSIBLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
ASKED MISTER JENKS RISING FROM HIS SEAT THE MYSTERIOUS MAN IS ABOARD THE AIRSHIP HIDDEN AWAY CRIED TOM THAT'S WHAT ERADICATE WAS TRYING TO CALL TO OUR ATTENTION AS WE STARTED OFF
I HOPE LIGHTNING DOESN'T STRIKE AROUND HERE THE STORM CAME ON RAPIDLY BUT THERE WAS A CURIOUS QUIETNESS IN THE AIR THAT WAS MORE ALARMING THAN IF A WIND HAD BLOWN THE CAMPFIRE BURNED STEADILY
WAS MISTER PARKER'S OPINION FROM WHAT THEN ASKED MISTER JENKS FROM THE DISCHARGES OF LIGHTNING AMONG THESE MOUNTAIN PEAKS WHICH CONTAIN SO MUCH IRON ORE
OUTCROPPINGS OF IRON ORE MADE THE PLACE BRIGHT ENOUGH TO SEE HERE WE ARE CRIED BILL RENSHAW AT LENGTH HERE'S THE WAY OUT MAKING A SUDDEN TURN IN THE WINDING PASSAGE HE SHOWED THE ADVENTURERS A SMALL OPENING
WAS THE REPLY OR RATHER WE DIDN'T IT WAS THE NERVOUS REACTION CAUSED BY YOUR FRIGHT AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAD DONE WRONG THAT MADE YOU JUMP OVER THE HANDLEBARS THAT'S THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION YOU YOU DID IT
BUT WE FANCY SOME OF OUR READERS CAN GUESS FINALLY AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF WORK THE WIRELESS WAS IN SHAPE TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES TOM PULLED OVER THE LEVER AND A CRACKLING SOUND WAS HEARD
TAKE THEM TO ANY JEWELER HE RESUMED TO THE ONE IN WHOSE PLACE I SAW YOU TO NIGHT I'LL ABIDE BY THE VERDICT YOU GET AND I'LL COME HERE TO MORROW NIGHT AND HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY WHY DO YOU COME AT NIGHT
THAT WAS MY UNDOING HOW AS SOON AS THE MEN GOT THE CASH THEY HAD NO FURTHER USE FOR ME THE NEXT I REMEMBER IS EATING A RUDE MEAL WHILE WE DISCUSSED THE FUTURE OF MAKING DIAMONDS
HAD BEEN GROWING LOUDER AND SHARPER INDICATING THE NEARER APPROACH OF THE STORM EACH LIGHTNING FLASH WAS FOLLOWED IN A SECOND OR TWO BY A TERRIFIC CLAP STILL THERE WAS NO WIND NOR RAIN
ASKED TOM WHO WAS BEGINNING TO BE INTERESTED THEY WERE STONES OF THE FIRST WATER THOUGH SMALL AN EXPERT GEM MERCHANT TO WHOM I TOOK THEM SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY DIAMONDS LIKE THEM AND HE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE I GOT THEM
FROM A HIGH PEAK I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF ONE WORKING THIS WAY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS THEN WE'D BETTER FASTEN THE TENT WELL DOWN CALLED TOM WE DON'T WANT IT TO BLOW AWAY
FOR NOW LOW MUTTERINGS OF THUNDER COULD BE HEARD OFF TOWARD THE WEST BLACK CLOUDS RAPIDLY OBSCURED THE HEAVENS AND THE SOUND OF THUNDER INCREASED
BUT IT WAS NOT THE SAME IT WAS OVER IN A FEW SECONDS THEN AS THE DIAMOND SEEKERS LOOKED THEY SAW IN THE GLARE OF A SCORE OF LIGHTNING FLASHES THAT FOLLOWED THE ONE GREAT CLAP
AS WHEN HE LEFT IT TO GO TO THE DIAMOND CAVE
NO ONE WOULD EVER HAVE THEM NOW TOM AND MISTER JENKS FELT A SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT BUT THEY WERE GLAD TO HAVE ESCAPED WITH THEIR LIVES
WENT ON MISTER ROBERTS I THINK SO THAT IS I DON'T KNOW I AM GOING TO TRY ANSWERED THE LAD THEN IF YOU SUCCEED I WISH YOU WOULD SELL US SOME FAIRLY BEGGED THE PROPRIETOR OF THE STORE
I SHOULD SAY IT WAS WORTH TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AS IT IS NOW THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THESE TWO STONES EXCLAIMED TOM THEY ARE WORTH EVERY CENT OF IT DECLARED MISTER ROBERTS
RATHER ODD COMMENTED MISTER JENKS BLACK PAPER AND WHITE INK WHITE INK IS EASY ENOUGH TO MAKE STATED MISTER PARKER
ASKED MISTER JENKS MY HOUSE MY FATHER HE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET US EVER SINCE WE STARTED BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE WIRELESS IN SHAPE TO RECEIVE MESSAGES OH I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO LATE TOO LATE BLESS MY SOUL TOO LATE FOR WHAT
THEIR INTERLOCKING BRANCHES HIDING THE GIRL TOM DID SEE CROWDS OF OTHER PERSONS THOUGH THRONGING THE STREETS OF SHOPTON FOR THOUGH THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD MADE MANY FLIGHTS THERE WAS ALWAYS A NOVELTY ABOUT THEM THAT BROUGHT OUT THE CURIOUS
ASKED TOM EAGERLY THE FINEST I HAVE EVER TESTED DECLARED THE OTHER MAN EVIDENTLY MISTER PORTER THE GEM EXPERT THEY ARE A JOY TO LOOK AT MISTER ROBERTS HE WENT ON TURNING TO THE PROPRIETOR
ANDY PEDALED ON NEVER LOOKING UP NOR BEHIND HIM A MOMENT LATER AS TOM THREW UP HIS HEADPLANES TO MAKE HIS LANDING MORE EASY AND JUST AS HE SWOOPED DOWN AT ONE SIDE OF THE CYCLIST OUR HERO LET OUT A MOST ALARMING YELL RIGHT INTO ANDY'S EAR
HE WAS LOOKING FROM THE REAR STOREROOM WINDOW HE'S THE SAME MAN WHO CALLED ON ME THAT TIME RAD REMEMBERS HIM VERY WELL BLESS MY SHOES WHAT'S TO BE DONE INQUIRED MISTER DAMON LOOKING AROUND HELPLESSLY
MISTER PARKER HE ASKED AS HE SAW THE SCIENTIST TRAMPING A LITTLE WAY UP THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN I AM GOING TO MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS WAS THE ANSWER AND NO ONE PAID ANY MORE ATTENTION TO HIM FOR SOME TIME
HE WASN'T THERE LONG ENOUGH WELL FARLEY MUNSON SO IT'S YOU IS IT ASKED MISTER JENKS AS HE SURVEYED THE PRISONER DO YOU KNOW HIM ASKED TOM IN SOME SURPRISE
FOR BREAKING THE PROPELLER OF THE BUTTERFLY AND SLASHING HER WINGS I'VE MENDED HER UP HOWEVER SO SHE GOES BETTER THAN EVER AND I CAN TAKE YOU TO THE POLICE STATION IN JIG TIME WANT TO COME ANDY THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE BULLY
CHAPTER THREE A STRANGE STORY WELL MISTER JENKS BEGAN TOM WHEN HE HAD DESCENDED TO THE GARDEN AND GREETED THE MAN WHO HAD ACTED SO STRANGELY ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND THIS IS RATHER AN ODD TIME FOR A VISIT
I HOPE NO ONE WAS MADE TO SUFFER FOR WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN MY IMPRUDENCE NO THE LAD WHOM MISTER TRACK CAUGHT WAS LET GO BUT HOW DID YOU HAPPEN TO COME TO SHOPTON TO SEE YOU
AND I'VE BEEN WAITING UNTIL THE OWNER CAME ALONG WHY ASKED TOM WONDERINGLY BECAUSE I'VE GOT A PROPOSITION TO MAKE TO YOU WENT ON THE MINER
WHEN WE GOT TO A SMALL TOWN CALLED INDIAN RIDGE NEAR LEADVILLE COLORADO THE MEN INSISTED THAT I MUST NOW PROCEED IN SECRET AND CONSENT TO BE BLINDFOLDED AS THEY WERE NOT YET READY TO REVEAL THE SECRET OF THE PLACE WHERE THEY MADE THE DIAMONDS
BUT THE MONOPLANE HAD BEEN REPAIRED AND ANDY HAD LEFT TOWN NOT HAVING RETURNED SINCE TELLING HIS FATHER THAT HE WAS GOING OFF ON A LITTLE BUSINESS TRIP WHICH HE OFTEN DID IN HIS AEROPLANE TOM WITH THE AID OF MISTER JACKSON THE ENGINEER WHEELED THE BUTTERFLY OUT OF ITS SHED
OBSERVED THE DIAMOND MAN AT FIRST I THOUGHT I WOULD BE FRIGHTENED BUT I'M NOT A BIT IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IF ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN SOMETHING IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN SOON SAID MISTER PARKER SUDDENLY
TOM AND THE OTHERS DEVOTED SEVERAL HOURS TO ARRANGING THEIR STATEROOMS AND BUNKS AND GETTING THEIR CLOTHING STOWED AWAY AND WHEN THIS WAS DONE MISTER PARKER AND MISTER JENKS SAT GAZING OFF INTO SPACE IT'S HARD TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE REALLY IN AN AIRSHIP
AS HE GAZED AT SOME WEATHER INSTRUMENTS ON THE CABIN WALL BLESS MY SOUL DON'T SAY THAT CRIED MISTER DAMON WHAT IS IT I THINK FROM MY OBSERVATIONS THAT WE WILL SOON HAVE A HURRICANE SAID THE SCIENTIFIC MAN
BUT THERE WAS NO TIME TO STOP NOW AND INVESTIGATE THIS WAY URGED BILL RENSHAW WE'LL SOON BE OUT BUT WON'T IT BE DANGEROUS TO GO OUTSIDE ASKED MISTER DAMON SHAN'T WE BE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING THERE IS SOME PROTECTION IN HERE NONE AT ALL
THE OTHER IN A ROUGH STATE DO YOU CARE TO STATE WHERE THESE DIAMONDS CAME FROM ASKED MISTER ROBERTS LOOKING CRITICALLY AT TOM I HAD RATHER NOT ANSWERED THE LAD IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE DIAMONDS
LITTLE OF IT WAS LEFT ON WHICH TO REMAIN LOOKING BACK TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE THE CAVE HAD BEEN TOM AND THE OTHERS STARTED FORWARD AGAIN THE DIAMOND MAKING MACHINERY HAD ALL BEEN DESTROYED
AND YET WE ARE HOW FAR ARE WE ABOVE THE EARTH TOM HE ASKED TURNING TO THE YOUNG INVENTOR ABOUT TWO MILES NOW I JUST SENT HER UP AS I THOUGHT I DETECTED THAT STORM MISTER PARKER SPOKE OF I TOLD YOU IT WOULD COME DECLARED THE SCIENTIST
HE SHOOK HIS FIST AT THOSE IN THE AIRSHIP AND SHOUTED AFTER THEM YOU'LL NEVER DISCOVER THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN
THE SEARCH FOR THE MYSTERIOUS MOUNTAIN AND THE CAVE OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS MIGHT OFFER A NEW FIELD FOR HIM BUT THERE CAME TO HIM A CERTAIN DISTRUST OF MISTER JENKS I DON'T LIKE TO DOUBT YOUR WORD BEGAN TOM SLOWLY
FOR THEY HAD NO FOOD SUPPLIES AND HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT BILL RENSHAW KNEW THE HAUNTS OF SOME GAME OF WHICH THEY MANAGED TO SNARE SOME THEY WOULD HAVE FARED BADLY FOR THEY HAD LEFT THEIR GUNS IN THE CAVE
IF WE HAVE TO WALK ALL THE WAY THIS CONTINGENCY CAUSED TOM SOME UNEASINESS HE DID NOT LIKE TO THINK THAT THE UNSCRUPULOUS MEN MIGHT DAMAGE THE RED CLOUD
OH IT ISN'T THAT THE PROPRIETOR HASTENED TO ASSURE HIM BUT THESE ARE DIAMONDS OF SUCH A PECULIAR KIND SO PERFECT AND WITHOUT A FLAW THAT I WONDERED FROM WHAT PART OF THE WORLD THEY CAME THEN THEY ARE DIAMONDS
IN THE RAYS OF THE MOON IT SHOWED ALL THE COLORS OF THE RAINBOW A BEAUTIFUL GEM THAT IS ONE OF THE STONES I MADE OR RATHER THAT I SUPPOSED I HAD MADE WENT ON MISTER JENKS IT IS ONE OF SEVERAL I HAVE
THEY STOOD STILL AWED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO THEN ONCE MORE CAME A TERRIFIC CLAP A GREAT MASS OF FIRE LIKE SOME RED HOT INGOT FROM A FOUNDRY
YOU MEAN YOU CAN HARDLY BELIEVE ME ASKED MISTER JENKS I GUESS THAT'S IT ASSENTED TOM I DON'T BLAME YOU A BIT EXCLAIMED THE ODD MAN IN FACT I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD MAKE DIAMONDS
REMARKED MISTER JENKS IT WOULD BE TOO BAD TO BE WRECKED BEFORE WE GOT TO PHANTOM MOUNTAIN WELL I PREDICT THAT WE WILL HAVE A BAD STORM INSISTED MISTER PARKER
IN THE SIDE OF THE CRAG IN AN INSTANT THEY HAD PASSED THROUGH AND FOUND THEMSELVES IN DAYLIGHT ONCE MORE THE SUDDEN GLARE ALMOST BLINDED THEM FOR THOUGH THE SKY WAS OVERCAST BY CLOUDS
THAT MORNING BUT ONLY THE LOWER EDGE OF IT CAUGHT THE RED CLOUD AND WHEN TOM SENT HER UP STILL HIGHER SHE FOUND A COMPARATIVELY QUIET ZONE WHERE SHE SLID ALONG AT GOOD SPEED
NOW MISTER DAMON IF YOU WILL JUST TAKE CHARGE OF THE STEERING APPARATUS FOR A MINUTE I WANT TO GO AFT WHAT FOR I WISH TO SEE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ERADICATE WAS MAKING THOSE QUEER MOTIONS
TOM SWIFT CONSIDERED A FEW MINUTES ON THE FACE OF IT THE PROPOSITION APPEALED TO HIM HE HAD BEEN HOME SOME TIME NOW AFTER HIS ADVENTURES ON EARTHQUAKE ISLAND AND HE WAS BEGINNING TO LONG FOR MORE EXCITEMENT
OF COURSE I DID NOT TELL HIM TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT I SAW FOLWELL AGAIN TOLD HIM TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIS COMPANIONS AND TO TELL THEM THAT I WOULD AGREE TO SUPPLY THE CASH NEEDED IF I COULD SHARE IN THE DIAMOND MAKING TO THIS THEY AGREED
PRESENTLY TWO ELDERLY GENTLEMEN CAME FROM THE LITTLE ROOM ON THE GLASS DOOR OF WHICH APPEARED THE WORD DIAMONDS WHO BROUGHT THESE STONES IN ASKED ONE OF THE MEN EVIDENTLY THE PROPRIETOR FROM THE DEFERENCE PAID HIM BY THE CLERK
HE INQUIRED OF TOM YES WAS THE HESITATING ANSWER BUT I DON'T WANT TO USE THEM IF I CAN HELP IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE DANGER AND A DISLIKE OF SHEDDING BLOOD BUT
MUST HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BEEN OVERTAKEN BY SOME SUPERNATURAL VISITOR ANDY GAVE A YELL LIKE AN INDIAN ABOUT TO DO A STAGE SCALPING ACT AND FAIRLY DIVED OVER THE HANDLEBARS OF HIS BICYCLE SPRAWLING IN A HEAP ON THE DUSTY ROAD
THERE WAS A LOOK OF WORRIMENT FATHER HAS JUST SENT ME A MESSAGE HE SAID IT'S A WARNING FLASHED THROUGH SPACE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET IT TO ME SINCE YESTERDAY
WENT ON MISTER JENKS WILL YOU GO WITH ME ON THIS QUEST GO IN YOUR AIRSHIP TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS IF YOU WILL I WILL SHARE WITH YOU WHATEVER DIAMONDS WE CAN DISCOVER OR MAKE BESIDES PAYING ALL EXPENSES
AND WAS ABOUT TO DASH WITH THEM TO THE EARTH THE MEN LEAPED TO THEIR FEET AND STARED AT THE LAD A STOWAWAY ON BOARD CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY SOUL HOW DID HE ARE YOU SURE THAT MESSAGE IS STRAIGHT ASKED MISTER JENKS
I WAS TOUCHED BY THE MAN'S APPEARANCE AND GAVE HIM SOME MONEY HE ASKED FOR MY CARD SAYING HE WOULD REPAY ME SOME DAY I GAVE IT TO HIM LITTLE THINKING I WOULD HEAR FROM THE MAN AGAIN BUT I DID
SHE WAS DAUGHTER OF HOLLAND COUNTESS OF PONTHIEU DUCHESS OF BERRY LADY OF CREVECOEUR OF MONTAGUE AND ARLOEUX BROUGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF TILTS AND TOURNAMENTS OF BANQUETS AND FEASTING AND ALL THE LAVISH DISPLAY OF THE RICH BAVARIAN COURT
OR DOTH SHE SPORT WITH ONE WHO SEEKETH HER GOOD AND AMAZEMENT AND PERPLEXITY SETTLED UPON HIS FACE THE PRINCESS WOO IS NEITHER CRAZED NOR DOTH SHE SPORT WITH THE MASTER SAID THE GIRL
AND THE VENGEANCE OF THE COUNTESS WAS SHARP AND MERCILESS BUT IN THE FLUSH OF VICTORY WRATH GAVE WAY TO PITY AGAIN AND THE YOUNG CONQUEROR IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID SADLY AND IN TEARS AH I HAVE WON AND YET HOW HAVE I LOST
SUBORDINATION PASSIVE SUBMISSION TO THE LAW TO PARENTS AND TO ALL SUPERIORS AND A PEACEFUL DEMEANOR
NOBLES AND PAGES AND LITTLE LADIES IN WAITING AND THERE WAS MUCH OF THE STATELY CEREMONIAL AND FLOWERY TALK THAT IN THOSE DAYS OF KNIGHTHOOD CLOTHED ALIKE THE FEARS OF COWARDS AND THE DESIRES OF HEROES FOR THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN HEROES AND COWARDS IN THE WORLD
ALTHOUGH TROUBLED WITH FEAR OF A BARBARIAN INVASION AND ATTACK GLITTERED WITH ALL THE GORGEOUSNESS AND DISPLAY OF THE MOST MAGNIFICENT EMPIRE IN THE WORLD IN THE GREAT DAPHNE OR CENTRAL SPACE OF THE IMPERIAL PALACE
THE DEATH OF COUNT WILLIAM SHOWED THE CODS A WAY TOWARD GREATER LIBERTY REBELLION FOLLOWED REBELLION AND THE RULE OF THE COUNTESS JACQUELINE WAS BY NO MEANS A RESTFUL ONE AND CHIEF AMONG THE REBELLIOUS SPIRITS AS LEADER AND COUNSELLOR AMONG THE CODS
BUT IT SHOWS HOW EVEN IN THE HEART OF A SOVEREIGN COUNTESS AND A GIRL GENERAL WARLIKE DESIRES MAY GIVE PLACE TO GENTLER THOUGHTS TO THE LORD ARKELL HOWEVER THIS UNEXPECTED PROPOSITION CAME AS AN INDICATION OF WEAKNESS
AND THE SIMPLICITY AND SOBERNESS OF THIS WISE YOUNG GIRL'S LIFE IN THE VERY MIDST OF SO MUCH POWER AND LUXURY MADE EVEN THE WORST ELEMENTS IN THE EMPIRE RESPECT AND HONOR HER IT WOULD BE INTERESTING DID SPACE PERMIT
THE LORD OF ARKELL SPRANG TO HIS COMRADE'S SIDE WITH A HURRIED WORD OF PRAISE HE FLUNG THE GABARDINE ABOUT HER GRASPED HER ARM AND BADE HER KEEP HER EYES FIRMLY FIXED UPON THE LIONS THEN STEP BY STEP THOSE TWO FOOLHARDY YOUNG PERSONS BACKED SLOWLY OUT OF THE DANGER
HOW THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE RIGHTFUL EMPEROR THE PRINCE KUNG TI WHOSE GUARDIAN AND CHIEF ADVISER THE PRESENT EMPEROR HAD BEEN HOW THIS TRUSTED PROTECTOR HAD MADE AWAY WITH POOR KUNG TI
RATHER THAN THE FOE OF THE EMPEROR ASK HIM WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE IN KEEPING WITH HIS VALOR AND HIS MIGHT
FOR THE NOBLES AND MERCHANTS OF HOLLAND FOUR CENTURIES AND A HALF AGO WERE AT OPEN STRIFE WITH ONE ANOTHER THE NOBLES SAW IN THE INCREASING PROSPERITY OF THE MERCHANTS THE END OF THEIR OWN FEUDAL POWER AND TYRANNY THE MERCHANTS
PURE AND SPARKLING SWEPT WITH A RAPID CURRENT FROM SWISS LAKE AND GLACIER SOUTHWARD TO THE BROAD AND BEAUTIFUL MEDITERRANEAN LYONS WAS ITS CAPITAL AND ON THE HILL OF FOURVIERE OVERLOOKING THE CITY BELOW IT
AND ARE GIVEN FULL STORE OF SOUTHERN GOLD AND TREASURE
BUT THE GREATEST GLORY OF CONSTANTINOPLE WAS AWAY BACK IN THE EARLY DAYS BEFORE THE TIME OF MOHAMMED OR OF THE CRUSADERS WHEN IT WAS THE CENTRE OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION THE CHIEF AND GORGEOUS CAPITAL OF A CHRISTIAN EMPIRE
MEANING THE BRILLIANT AND NOBLE MAID IN SPITE OF THE WICKED UNCLE GUNDEBALD WERE MARRIED AT SOISSONS
CONCLUDED THAT AFTER ALL THEY HAD MADE A MISTAKE IN BETROTHING HER TO KING CLOVIS THOU SHOULDST HAVE REMEMBERED MY LORD THEY SAID THAT THOU DIDST SLAY CLOTILDA'S FATHER HER MOTHER AND THE YOUNG PRINCES HER BROTHERS
PREFECT AND NOBLES AND IMPERIAL GUARDS SPRANG TO THEIR FEET AS THE SPEAR CLASHED ON THE PAVEMENT AND EVEN THE BARBARIAN ENVOYS WHILE THEY SMILED GRIMLY AT THEIR YOUNG COMRADE'S ENERGY PULLED HIM HASTILY BACK BUT ERE
SEE LORD OF ARKELL YOU WHO CAN PRATE SO LOUDLY OF CODS AND LIONS HERE BEFORE ALL I DARE YOU TO FACE COUNT WILLIAM'S LIONS YOURSELF THE YOUNG LORD OF ARKELL WAS IN HIS RICH COURT SUIT A TIGHT FITTING GREAT SLEEVED SILK JACKET
SAID PULCHERIA THE PRINCESS BID THAT THE STIPEND BE FIXED AT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS OF GOLD GOOD ANTHEMIUS AND LET OUR GUESTS BEAR TO RUAS THE KING PLEDGES AND TOKENS OF THE EMPEROR'S FRIENDSHIP
HE EXPRESSED A WILLINGNESS HOWEVER TO HAVE THE PRINCESS CLOTILDA BROUGHT UP IN HIS PALACE WHICH HAD BEEN HER FATHER'S
THEODOSIUS THE BOY EMPEROR AND HIS THREE SISTERS PULCHERIA MARINA AND ARCADIA
RECOGNIZED IN THE ARROGANT NOBLES THE ONLY BAR TO THE GROWTH OF HOLLAND'S COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE SO EACH FACTION HAD ITS LEADERS ITS PARTISANS ITS BADGES AND ITS FOLLOWERS
AND AMONG ALL THE RACES OF MEN THE ONLY NATION THAT WAS CIVILIZED AND LEARNED AND CULTIVATED AND REFINED IN THIS
PREFECT OF THE EAST AND GOVERNOR OR GUARDIAN OF THE YOUNG EMPEROR WAS GREATLY DISTURBED BY THE TIDINGS OF THIS NEW INVASION ALREADY HE HAD REPELLED AT GREAT COST THE FIRST ADVANCE OF THESE TERRIBLE HUNS
FOR OVER TWO THOUSAND YEARS WAS THE CAPITAL OF CHINA
AND LAID HIS HAND CARESSINGLY UPON THE SHAGGY MANE CLOSE TO HIS SIDE PRESSED JUNO THE LIONESS AND SO SAYS THE RECORD OF THE OLD DUTCH CHRONICLER VON HILDEGAERSBERCH THE LIONS DID HIM NO HARM
AND THE MERCHANTS OR CODS WITH THEIR SLOUCH HATS OF QUIET GRAY STRUGGLED FOR THE LEAD IN THE STATE AND HOW THEY DID HATE ONE ANOTHER CERTAIN OF THE YOUNGER NOBLES HOWEVER WHO WERE OPPOSED TO THE REIGNING HOUSE OF HOLLAND
THESE DIRT CLIFFS OR LOESS TO GIVE THEM THEIR SCIENTIFIC NAME ARE REMARKABLE BANKS OF BROWNISH YELLOW LOAM FOUND LARGELY IN NORTHERN AND WESTERN CHINA AND RISING SOMETIMES TO A HEIGHT OF A THOUSAND FEET
WHICH THEIR GREAT ANCESTORS CONSTANTINE AND THEODOSIUS HAD ESTABLISHED AND STRENGTHENED AND NOW THERE WAS CONFUSION IN THE IMPERIAL PALACE
THE LITTLE CITY BY THE YELLOW RIVER WHERE HER FATHER THE BANNERMAN HELD GUARD AT THE DRAGON GATE HE WAS ABOUT TO CALL OUT TO THE GIRL TO SAVE HERSELF WHEN WITH A SUDDEN SWOOP
BUT AJAX FIERCEST OF THE THREE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE LAD STRAIGHT ACROSS HIS COMRADES HE LOOKED TO WHERE SCARCE A ROD BEHIND THE DARING LAD CAME ANOTHER FIGURE A LIGHT AND GRACEFUL FORM
THE ANSWER OF THE GIRL WAS AS READY AS IT WAS UNEXPECTED
AND SHE WAS PLEDGED BY HER DYING FATHER'S COMMAND TO MARRY HER COUSIN WHOM SHE DETESTED DUKE JOHN OF BRABANT BUT HOW MUCH BETTER SO SHE REASONED THAT THE NAME AND MIGHT OF HER HOUSE AS RULERS OF HOLLAND SHOULD BE UPHELD BY A BRAVE AND FEARLESS KNIGHT
AND THE HUNNISH ENVOYS WITH A GAZE OF STOLID WONDER LOOKED DOWN UPON THE GREAT HIPPODROME OF CONSTANTINOPLE IT WAS A VAST ENCLOSURE SPACIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE MARSHALLING OF AN ARMY
CRUSH WE THESE REBEL CURS VON BREDERODE SHE CRIED POINTING TO THE BANNER OF ARKELL FOR BY MY FATHER'S MEMORY THEY SHALL HAVE NEITHER MERCY NOR LIFE FROM ME FAST UPON THE CURT REFUSAL OF THE LORD OF ARKELL CAME HIS MESSAGE OF DEFIANCE HEAR YE COUNTESS OF HOLLAND RANG OUT THE CHALLENGE OF THE
HAD DARED TO FACE COUNT WILLIAM'S LIONS AGAIN THE REMEMBRANCE OF HOW HIS DARING HAD MADE HIM ONE OF HER HEROES FILLED HER HEART AND A DREAM OF WHAT MIGHT BE POSSESSED HER HER BOY HUSBAND THE FRENCH DAUPHIN WAS DEAD
SIX MUCH ASTONISHED TARTAR ROBBERS REGARDING WITH LOOKS OF PUZZLED WONDER A DEFIANT LITTLE CHINESE GIRL
KING GUNDEBALD DECLINED LONGER TO SHELTER HIS NIECE IN HIS PALACE AT GENEVA AND WHY MAY I NOT GO WITH YOU THE GIRL ASKED OF UGO BUT THE OLD PRIEST KNEW THAT A CONQUERED AND PLUNDERED LAND WAS NO PLACE TO WHICH TO CONVEY A YOUNG MAID FOR SAFETY
AND RULE THIS EMPIRE AS BECOMETH THE DAUGHTER OF ARCADIUS AND THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF THE GREAT THEODOSIUS AND AS HE DESIRED SO IT WAS DECIDED THE SENATE OF THE EAST DECREED IT AND IN LONG PROCESSION
SAID THE PREFECT ANTHEMIUS WHEN THE GLITTERING REAR GUARD HAD PASSED FROM THE HIPPODROME AND THE PRINCESS PULCHERIA ADDED AND THESE O MEN FROM THE NORTH ARE TO HELP AND SUCCOR THE FRIENDS OF THE GREAT EMPEROR
THE PONDEROUS BATTLE AXE OF THE KNIGHT OF LEYENBURG CRASHED THROUGH THE HELMET OF THE LORD OF ARKELL AND AS THE BRAVE YOUNG LEADER FELL TO THE GROUND HIS PANIC STRICKEN FOLLOWERS TURNED AND FLED THE TROOPS OF JACQUELINE PURSUED THEM THROUGH THE STREETS OF GORKUM AND OUT INTO THE OPEN COUNTRY
HERALD OF ARKELL AS HIS TRUMPET BLAST SOUNDED BEFORE THE GATE OF THE CITADEL THE FREE LORD OF ARKELL HERE GIVETH YOU WORD AND WARNING THAT HE WILL FIGHT AGAINST YOU ON THE MORROW AND FROM THE CITADEL CAME BACK THIS RINGING REPLY AS THE KNIGHT OF LEYENBURG MADE ANSWER FOR HIS SOVEREIGN LADY
BECAUSE OF CERTAIN BOLD ATTEMPTS TO FAVOR THE CODS IN HIS OWN CASTLE OF ARKELL HIS DEFIANT WORDS THEREFORE RAISED A STORM OF PROTESTS
A CRY OF TERROR BROKE FROM EVERY LIP THE DAUPHIN JOHN TURNED PALE WITH FRIGHT AND COUNT WILLIAM OF HOLLAND CALLING OUT DOWN AJAX BACK GIRL BACK
WITH A BOUND HE CLEARED THE INTERVENING SPACE AND CROUCHED AT THE FEET OF THE FAIR YOUNG PRINCESS JACQUELINE
IT IS NOT THEREFORE SURPRISING THAT THIS INTREPID AND ROMANCE REARED YOUNG PRINCESS THE WIFE OF A LAD FOR WHOM SHE NEVER ESPECIALLY CARED AND WHOSE SOCIETY HAD FOR POLITICAL REASONS BEEN FORCED UPON HER SHOULD HAVE PLACED AS THE HERO OF HER ADMIRATION
THAT THE FIRST RECORDED DESIRE OF THIS BEAUTIFUL BRAVE AND DEVOUT YOUNG MAIDEN WHEN SHE FOUND HERSELF SAFELY AMONG THE FIERCE FOLLOWERS OF KING CLOVIS WAS A REQUEST FOR VENGEANCE BUT WE MUST REMEMBER GIRLS AND BOYS
THEN UPROSE THE YOUNG LORD OF ARKELL HOLD THERE HE CRIED HOTLY THIS HUBERT OF MALSEN IS BUT A CRAVEN SIRS IF HE DOTH SAY THE MERCHANTS OF DORT ARE RASCAL COWARDS HAD THEY BEEN FAIRLY MATED HE HAD NO MORE DARED TO PUT HIS NOSE WITHIN THE GATES OF DORT
THE BARON OF THE FORESTS OF THE DUKE OF BURGUNDY A PLAIN DUTCH GENTLEMAN FRANCIS VON BORSELEN THE LAD WHO YEARS BEFORE HAD FURNISHED THE GRAY GABARDINE THAT HAD SHIELDED COUNT WILLIAM'S DAUGHTER FROM HER FATHER'S LIONS
AND MAKE YOU ALL CAPTIVES AND SLAVES IT SHALL BE WAR BETWEEN YOU AND US FOREVER THUS SAITH MY SPEAR AND AS HE SPOKE HE DASHED HIS LONG SPEAR UPON THE FLOOR UNTIL THE MOSAIC PAVEMENT RANG AGAIN BOY EMPEROR AND PRINCESSES
SAID THE CLEAR CALM VOICE OF THE UNTERRIFIED GIRL WERE IT NOT WISE TO TELL THIS WILD YOUNG PRINCE FROM THE NORTHERN FOREST THAT THE GREAT EMPEROR HATH GOLD FOR HIS FRIENDS BUT ONLY IRON FOR HIS FOES
AND LONG HORSETAIL PLUME WERE STREAMING IN THE WIND AND JUST AS HE HAD BRACED HIMSELF TO MEET THE ONSET AGAINST THE GREAT LOESS OR DIRT CLIFF HE FELT A TWITCH AT HIS BLACK UPPER ROBE AND A LOW VOICE A GIRL'S
COUNT WILLIAM OF HOLLAND DEARLY LOVED PLUCK AND NERVE WELL DAUGHTER MINE HE SAID
WAS GREAT AND POWERFUL THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF CHUNG KWOH THE MIDDLE KINGDOM AS THE CHINESE FOR NEARLY THIRTY CENTURIES HAVE CALLED THEIR VAST COUNTRY
WITH A LOOK OF PLEASED SURPRISE AT THIS BOLD STROKE OF THE PRINCESS THE PREFECT CLAPPED HIS HANDS IN COMMAND AND THE HEAVILY BROCADED CURTAIN THAT SCREENED THE GILDED COLUMNS PARTED AS IF BY UNSEEN HANDS
TELL HIM YOU MEANT NO SUCH MURDEROUS TEST MY FATHER SHE CRIED TURNING NOW TOWARD COUNT WILLIAM WHOSE ATTENTION HAD BEEN DRAWN TO THE DISPUTE
IN THE DAYS WHEN PASSION INSTEAD OF LOVE RULED THE HEARTS OF MEN AND WOMEN AND OF BOYS AND GIRLS AS WELL AND HOW FAVORED ARE WE OF THIS NINETEENTH CENTURY IN ALL THE PEACE AND PROSPERITY AND HOME HAPPINESS THAT SURROUND US
FROM HER STATION IN THE CITADEL SHE LOOKED OVER THE SCENE BEFORE HER HERE ALONG THE LOW BANK OF THE RIVER MAAS STRETCHED THE CAMP OF HER OWN FOLLOWERS AND THE LITTLE GAYLY COLORED BOATS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER ARMY UP THE RIVER FROM THE RED ROOFS OF ROTTERDAM
MADE FRANCE A CHRISTIAN NATION AND SO HELPED ON THE PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION
HE BROUGHT ALL THE LAND UNDER HIS SWAY FROM THE RHINE TO THE RHONE THE OCEAN AND THE PYRENEES HE WAS HAILED BY HIS PEOPLE WITH THE OLD ROMAN TITLES OF CONSUL AND AUGUSTUS
EVEN THE CHIVALRY OF THAT DAY WHICH SHOULD HAVE PROMPTED HIM TO AID RATHER THAN ANNOY THIS BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE RAISED A CONSIDERABLE ARMY AMONG THE KNIGHTS OF THE CODS OR LIBERAL PARTY AND THE WARLIKE MERCHANTS OF THE CITIES TOOK POSSESSION OF MANY STRONG POSITIONS IN HOLLAND
I DO BUT SPEAK THE TRUTH GREAT IS TAI TSUNG WHOM HE WILL HE SLAYETH AND WHOM HE WILL HE KEEPETH ALIVE AND THEN SHE TOLD THE ASTONISHED PRIEST THAT THE BANNERMAN OF THE DRAGON GATE
NEXT TO HER OWN FEARLESS FATHER NOT THE DAUPHIN JOHN OF FRANCE BUT THIS BRAVE YOUNG REBEL LAD OTTO THE LORD OF ARKELL
SAW HER DUTY PLAINLY AND UNDERTOOK IT SIMPLY AND WITHOUT HESITATION
AS HE MAY TAKE THE GUIDANCE ON HIMSELF NAY NOT SO PRINCESS THE OLD PREFECT SAID SHE WHO CAN SHAPE THE WAYS OF A BOY MAY GUIDE THE WILL OF AN EMPIRE BE THOU THEN REGENT AND AUGUSTA
AND WITH A SHRILL LAUGH OF DERISION SPRANG UP THE SHARP INCLINE AND DISAPPEARED IN ONE OF THE MANY CLIFF CAVES BEFORE THE NOW DOUBLY BAFFLED HORSEMEN COULD SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER WITH A GRUNT OF DISCOMFITURE AND DISGUST
AND THE RESIDENCE OF CHRISTIAN EMPERORS FROM THE DAYS OF CONSTANTINE THE CONQUEROR TO THOSE OF JUSTINIAN
IT WAS A LAND OF FOREST AND VINEYARDS OF FAIR VALLEYS AND SHELTERED HILL SIDES AND OF BUSY CITIES THAT THE FOSTERING HAND OF ROME HAD BEAUTIFIED WHILE THROUGH ITS BROAD DOMAIN THE RHONE
ON HIS HOMEWARD JOURNEY FROM JERUSALEM
THE STORY OF JACQUELINE OF HOLLAND IS ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC THAT HAS COME DOWN TO US FROM THOSE ROMANTIC DAYS OF THE KNIGHTS HAPPY ONLY IN HER EARLIEST AND LATEST YEARS SHE IS NEVERTHELESS A BRIGHT AND ATTRACTIVE FIGURE AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF FEUDAL TYRANNY AND CRIME
THE PREFECT ANTHEMIUS COULD SUFFICIENTLY MASTER HIS ASTONISHMENT TO REPLY THE YOUNG PRINCESS PULCHERIA FACED THE SAVAGE ENVOYS AND POINTING TO THE CAUSE OF THE DISTURBANCE ASKED CALMLY WHO IS THIS BRAWLING BOY
OF THE SAD CONDITION OF ONE WHO IS THE DAUGHTER OF A ROYAL LINE HE BADE ME USE ALL MY WIT TO COME NIGH TO THEE AND TO SAY THAT IF IT BE THE WILL OF THE GODS HE WOULD FAIN RAISE THEE TO HIS RANK BY MARRIAGE
BUT WITH AN AIR OF OPEN AND HOSTILE SUPERIORITY THAT WOULD NOT BE MOVED EVEN BY ALL THE GLOW AND GLITTER OF AN IMPERIAL COURT THEN ESLAW THE CHIEF OF THE ENVOYS OF KING RUAS THE HUN MADE KNOWN HIS MASTER'S DEMANDS
APPEARED THE BRAVE LAD WHO HAD ONCE BEEN THE COMPANION OF THE PRINCESS IN DANGER THE YOUNG LORD OF ARKELL IT WAS HE WHO LIFTED THE STANDARD OF REVOLT AGAINST HER REGENCY PLACING THE WELFARE OF HOLLAND ABOVE PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP AND SINKING IN HIS DESIRE FOR GLORY
WHEN THREATENED BY FOREIGN FOES OR BY THE DESTROYING OCEAN FLOODS JACQUELINE'S EYE CAUGHT THE FLUTTER OF THE BROAD BANNER OF THE HOUSE OF ARKELL THAT WAVED OVER THE REBEL CAMP AGAIN SHE SAW THE BRAVE LAD WHO ALONE OF ALL HER FATHER'S COURT SAVE SHE
THAT THE TONGUE IS A LITTLE MEMBER BUT IT CAN KINDLE A GREAT FIRE HOW MAYST THOU HOPE TO SAY SUCH DIREFUL WORDS AGAINST THE SON OF HEAVEN
THE YOUNG GIRL BROUGHT THE PILGRIM FOOD AND THEN ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF THE DAY KNEELING ON THE EARTHEN FLOOR SHE BEGAN TO BATHE HIS FEET BUT AS SHE DID SO THE PILGRIM BENDING FORWARD SAID IN A LOW VOICE LADY
FOR NEVER IN THIS CARRIAGE SHALL I REACH THE PRESENCE OF MY LORD THE KING AND NONE TOO SOON WAS HER ADVICE ACTED UPON FOR THE COUNSELLORS OF KING GUNDEBALD
THOMAS THE NESTORIAN HAD BEEN IN MANY LANDS AND IN THE MIDST OF MANY DANGERS BUT HE HAD NEVER BEFORE FOUND HIMSELF IN QUITE SO UNPLEASANT A POSITION AS NOW SIX UGLY TARTAR HORSEMEN WITH VERY UNCOMFORTABLE LOOKING SPEARS AND APPALLING SHOUTS
THE MARTIAL PROCESSION PASSED BEFORE THE EYES OF THE NORTHERN BARBARIANS WATCHFUL OF EVERY MOVEMENT EAGER AS CHILDREN TO WITNESS THIS ROYAL REVIEW THESE
TO REMAIN AWHILE AND LOOK AFTER THE GIRL'S EDUCATION IN THOSE DAYS A KING'S REQUEST WAS A COMMAND AND THE GOOD UGO THOUGH STERN AND BRAVE IN THE FACE OF REAL DANGER
EMPEROR THOUGH HE WAS CALLED WAS ONLY A BOY OF TWELVE AND NOT A VERY BRIGHT BOY AT THAT HIS FATHER ARCADIUS THE EMPEROR AND HIS MOTHER EUDOXIA THE EMPRESS WERE DEAD AND IN THE GREAT PALACE AT CONSTANTINOPLE IN THIS YEAR OF GRACE
BUT NOW THE LORD OF ARKELL HAD FOUND HIS TONGUE MY LORD PRINCE HE SAID BOWING LOW WITH STATELY COURTESY IF AS MY LADY MOTHER AND GOOD COUNT WILLIAM WOULD FORCE ME I AM TO BE LOYAL VASSAL TO YOU MY LIEGES HERE I SHOULD BUT FOLLOW WHERE YOU DARE TO LEAD
AND HER RARE COMMON SENSE RULE THOU IN MY PLACE O PRINCESS HE SAID SOON AFTER THIS INTERVIEW WITH THE BARBARIAN ENVOYS THOU ALONE OF ALL IN THIS BROAD EMPIRE
IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT USURP THE THRONE AND HOW SHE THE PRINCESS WOO HAD BEEN FLUNG INTO THE SWIFT HWANG HO FROM THE TURBID WATERS OF WHICH SHE HAD BEEN RESCUED BY THE BANNERMAN OF THE DRAGON GATE
PULCHERIA OF CONSTANTINOPLE THE GIRL OF THE GOLDEN HORN AFTERWARD KNOWN AS PULCHERIA AUGUSTA EMPRESS OF THE EAST
AND THE HAGUE WERE FAST DRAWING TO A CLOSE ON THE FOURTH OF APRIL FOURTEEN SEVENTEEN THE DAUPHIN JOHN DIED BY POISONING IN HIS FATHER'S CASTLE AT COMPIEGNE
AND THE TRUTH OF THE FACT WOULD BE MORE POWERFUL THAN THOSE THAT INFLICTED THE PUNISHMENTS UPON HIM
ABEDNEGO THESE THE KING HAD IN ESTEEM AND CONTINUED TO LOVE BECAUSE OF THE VERY EXCELLENT TEMPER THEY WERE OF AND BECAUSE OF THEIR APPLICATION TO LEARNING
THEY GOT READY BOOTY FOR THE PUBLIC AND FOR THEIR OWN PRIVATE FAMILIES WHEREAS TILL THEN THEY HAD NOT ANY SORT OF PLENTY OF EVEN NECESSARY FOOD THE FOREMENTIONED BATTLE WHEN THEY HAD ONCE GOT IT WAS ALSO THE OCCASION OF THEIR PROSPERITY
BUT THE TWO HANDS AND ARMS SIGNIFY THIS THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT SHALL BE DISSOLVED BY TWO KINGS BUT ANOTHER KING THAT SHALL COME FROM THE WEST ARMED WITH BRASS SHALL DESTROY THAT GOVERNMENT AND ANOTHER GOVERNMENT
BUT DEDICATED HIS SWORD TO GOD AT THE TABERNACLE CHAPTER TEN SAUL ENVIES DAVID FOR HIS GLORIOUS SUCCESS AND TAKES AN OCCASION OF ENTRAPPING HIM FROM THE PROMISE HE MADE HIM
BECAUSE HAD THEY TAKEN SOME FOOD THEY HAD PURSUED THE ENEMY WITH GREATER RIGOR AND ALACRITY AND HAD BOTH TAKEN AND SLAIN
AMNON CONFESSED HIS PASSION THAT HE WAS IN LOVE WITH A SISTER OF HIS WHO HAD THE SAME FATHER WITH HIMSELF SO JENADAB SUGGESTED TO HIM BY WHAT METHOD AND CONTRIVANCE HE MIGHT OBTAIN HIS DESIRES
BY WHICH ACT THE FATHER MUST BE TREATED UNJUSTLY IN THE SON'S SLAUGHTER
AND THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED UNDER THE CONDUCT OF JEPHTHA AND GIDEON WHAT MADNESS THEREFORE POSSESSED YOU TO FLY FROM GOD
BUT WE SHALL TREAT MORE ACCURATELY ABOUT THE OBLATION OF THESE CREATURES IN OUR DISCOURSE CONCERNING SACRIFICES BUT IF A PERSON FALL INTO SIN BY IGNORANCE HE OFFERS AN EWE LAMB OR A FEMALE KID OF THE GOATS OF THE SAME AGE
BUT GOD WAS GRIEVED THAT THE KING OF THE AMALEKITES WAS PRESERVED ALIVE AND THAT THE MULTITUDE HAD SEIZED ON THE CATTLE FOR A PREY BECAUSE THESE THINGS WERE DONE WITHOUT HIS PERMISSION FOR HE THOUGHT IT AN INTOLERABLE THING THAT THEY SHOULD CONQUER
AND HAD DRIVEN AWAY MUCH PREY HE RETURNED WITH HIS ARMY BACK TO DAMASCUS NOW WHEN THE KING OF JERUSALEM KNEW THAT THE SYRIANS WERE RETURNED HOME HE SUPPOSING HIMSELF A MATCH FOR THE KING OF ISRAEL DREW OUT HIS ARMY AGAINST HIM
AND NONE OF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THESE THINGS BUT YOU KEEP SILENCE AND WATCH TO SEE WHAT WILL BE THE UPSHOT OF THESE THINGS WHEN THE KING HAD MADE THIS SPEECH NOT ONE OF THE REST OF THOSE THAT WERE PRESENT MADE ANY ANSWER BUT DOEG THE SYRIAN WHO FED HIS MULES
AND THIS OUT OF THAT HATRED TO ARCHCLAUS AND PHILIP WHICH THE CALUMNIES OF ANTIPATER HAD RAISED AGAINST THEM HE ALSO BEQUEATHED A THOUSAND TALENTS TO CAESAR AND FIVE HUNDRED TO JULIA CAESAR'S WIFE TO CAESAR'S CHILDREN AND FRIENDS AND FREED MEN
UPON WHICH THE PROPHET SAID THAT AFTER THE SAME MANNER SHOULD THE KINGDOM BE RENT FROM HIM
THEY ALSO MADE A CLAMOR AGAINST THOSE THAT PRETENDED HE WOULD BE OF NO ADVANTAGE TO THEIR AFFAIRS AND THEY SAID WHERE NOW ARE THESE MEN LET THEM BE BROUGHT TO PUNISHMENT WITH ALL THE LIKE THINGS THAT
AND SAID THAT GOD GAVE THEM HIS ASSISTANCE NOT OUT OF REGARD TO MOSES'S INTERCESSIONS BUT BECAUSE HE TOOK CARE OF THEIR ENTIRE NATION ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR FOREFATHERS WHOSE AFFAIRS HE TOOK UNDER HIS OWN CONDUCT AS ALSO
HIS FATHER LIVED IN GREAT SPLENDOR IF THEREFORE THOU WILT SEND FOR HIM AND NOT DESPISE HIM ON THE SCORE OF HIS MISFORTUNES THOU WILT LEARN WHAT THY DREAMS SIGNIFY SO THE KING COMMANDED THAT THEY SHOULD BRING JOSEPH INTO HIS PRESENCE
WITHOUT TAKING ANY COMFORT IN THE REST AND SO HE WAS ALSO AFFECTED WITH HIS MISFORTUNE BEFORE HE MET WITH JOSEPH'S BRETHREN WHEN HE ALSO CONJECTURED THAT JOSEPH WAS DESTROYED BY WILD BEASTS
THAT THE PEOPLE HAD RESERVED THEM FOR SACRIFICES BUT THAT AS TO THE NATION OF THE AMALEKITES IT WAS ENTIRELY DESTROYED AS HE HAD RECEIVED IT IN COMMAND TO SEE DONE AND THAT NO ONE MAN WAS LEFT BUT THAT HE HAD SAVED ALIVE THE KING ALONE
OF SO GREAT A FRIENDSHIP OF THESE KINGS ONE WITH ANOTHER AND DID NOT THINK SO CLOSE AN AGREEMENT OF SO MANY POTENTATES TO BE FOR THE INTEREST OF THE ROMANS HE THEREFORE SENT SOME OF HIS DOMESTICS TO EVERY ONE OF THEM
AND ADVISED HIM TO LEAVE THE TROUBLE OF LESSER CAUSES TO OTHERS
HE REMOVED TO TIBERIAS A CITY OF GALILEE NOW HE WAS IN GREAT ESTEEM AMONG OTHER KINGS ACCORDINGLY THERE CAME TO HIM ANTIOCHUS KING OF COMMALENA SAMPSIGERATNUS
TO GO AGAINST THE ENEMY'S CAMP IN ORDER TO DESTROY THOSE THAT WERE IN IT AND WHEN THE PRIEST SAID THAT GOD DID NOT GIVE ANY ANSWER SAUL REPLIED AND NOT WITHOUT SOME CAUSE DOES GOD REFUSE TO ANSWER WHAT WE INQUIRE OF HIM
AND THUS DID HE END HIS LIFE AFTER HE HAD ENDURED VARIOUS AND MANIFOLD TURNS OF FORTUNE IN HIS LIFETIME FOR HE WAS MADE HIGH PRIEST OF THE JEWISH NATION
OF THE TRIBE OF EPHRAIM OVER THEM
BY PERPETRATING SO BARBAROUS A CRIME AND MURDERING THE WHOLE FAMILY OF THE HIGH PRIESTLY DIGNITY BY HAVING NO PITY OF THE INFANTS NOR REVERENCE FOR THE AGED AND BY OVERTHROWING THE CITY WHICH GOD HAD CHOSEN FOR THE PROPERTY
THAT IF ANY ONE PUT A STOP TO HIS SLAUGHTER OF THE ENEMY AND FELL ON EATING AND LEFT OFF THE SLAUGHTER OR THE PURSUIT BEFORE THE NIGHT CAME ON AND OBLIGED THEM SO TO DO
HE BROUGHT HIS ARMY OUT OF THEIR WINTER QUARTERS AND MARCHED INTO THE COUNTRY OF DAMASCUS
TO BE HURRIED AWAY BY DEATH BUT I AM BOUND TO ACCEPT OF WHAT PROVIDENCE ALLOTS AS IT PLEASES GOD FOR WE HAVE BY NO MEANS LIVED ILL BUT IN A SPLENDID AND HAPPY MANNER
BUT IF ANY ONE HAD OBTAINED BY PRAYER TO GOD THE RECOVERY FROM THAT DISTEMPER AND HAD GAINED A HEALTHFUL COMPLEXION AGAIN
AND HAD FORBIDDEN THEM TO CARRY ANY INSTRUMENT OF IRON OR AT ALL TO MAKE USE OF ANY IRON IN ANY CASE WHATSOEVER AND ON ACCOUNT OF THIS PROHIBITION IT WAS THAT THE HUSBANDMEN IF THEY HAD OCCASION TO SHARPEN ANY OF THEIR TOOLS
WERE ALSO FIT TO DRINK WHICH WATER RUNS INTO THE LAKE CALLED ASPHALTIRIS AND WHEN THE PHYSICIANS ONCE THOUGHT FIT TO HAVE HIM BATHED IN A VESSEL FULL OF OIL IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS JUST DYING
AND WHEN HE HEARD THAT SAMUEL WAS COME HE WENT OUT TO MEET HIM BUT THE PROPHET SAID HE HAD NOT DONE WELL IN DISOBEYING THE INJUNCTIONS HE HAD SENT TO HIM AND HAD NOT STAID TILL HIS COMING WHICH
AND TOSSED AND GO AWAY BY FLIGHT WHILE THEY SAY ONE TO ANOTHER STAND STAND STILL SEIZE THEIR GOLD AND SILVER FOR THERE SHALL BE NO ONE TO WISH THEM WELL FOR THEY WILL RATHER SAVE THEIR LIVES THAN THEIR MONEY
WHO THOUGHT IT AN IGNOMINIOUS THING TO RETIRE UPON HIS APPROACH AND LED THEM TO THE KING
AND OUT OF LIBANUS TAX FREE AND THE SAME I WOULD HAVE OBSERVED AS TO THOSE OTHER MATERIALS WHICH WILL BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO RENDER THE TEMPLE MORE GLORIOUS
HIS FEAR WAS SO PREVALENT THAT HE COULD NOT GIVE CREDIT TO AN APOLOGY THAT WAS VERY JUST SO HE COMMANDED HIS ARMED MEN THAT STOOD ABOUT HIM TO KILL HIM AND ALL HIS KINDRED BUT AS THEY DURST NOT TOUCH THE HIGH PRIEST BUT WERE MORE AFRAID OF DISOBEYING GOD THAN THE KING
AND ANOINTED HIM AND WHISPERED HIM IN THE EAR AND ACQUAINTED HIM THAT GOD CHOSE HIM TO BE THEIR KING AND EXHORTED HIM TO BE RIGHTEOUS AND OBEDIENT TO HIS COMMANDS FOR THAT BY THIS MEANS HIS KINGDOM WOULD CONTINUE FOR A LONG TIME
ON CONDITION TO HAVE THEIR RIGHT EYES PLUCKED OUT OR TO UNDERGO A SIEGE AND TO HAVE THEIR CITIES OVERTHROWN HE GAVE THEM THEIR CHOICE WHETHER THEY WOULD CUT OFF A SMALL MEMBER OF THEIR BODY OR UNIVERSALLY PERISH
THIS WAS TOLD TO THE KING BY THE SCRIBES THAT THE MULTITUDE WERE SINNING AGAINST GOD AS THEY SACRIFICED AND WERE EATING BEFORE THE BLOOD WAS WELL WASHED AWAY AND THE FLESH WAS MADE CLEAN THEN DID SAUL GIVE ORDER THAT A GREAT STONE SHOULD BE ROLLED INTO THE MIDST OF THEM
AND GAVE REWARDS TO SUCH AS HAD SIGNALIZED THEMSELVES IN THE ACTION AND HIGHLY COMMENDED JOSHUA THEIR GENERAL WHO WAS ATTESTED TO BY ALL THE ARMY ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT ACTIONS HE HAD DONE
KING NEBUCHADNEZZAR SAW A WONDERFUL DREAM THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF WHICH GOD SHOWED HIM IN HIS SLEEP BUT WHEN HE AROSE OUT OF HIS BED HE FORGOT THE ACCOMPLISHMENT SO HE SENT FOR THE CHALDEANS AND MAGICIANS AND THE PROPHETS AND TOLD THEM THAT HE HAD SEEN A DREAM
SUPPOSING THAT HE HAD NOT PURIFIED HIMSELF SINCE HE HAD ACCOMPANIED WITH HIS WIFE AND SO COULD NOT BE PRESENT BUT WHEN HE SAW THAT HE WAS NOT THERE THE SECOND DAY OF THE MONTH NEITHER HE INQUIRED OF HIS SON JONATHAN WHY THE SON OF JESSE DID NOT COME TO THE SUPPER AND THE FEAST
AND THEREBY FREED US FROM THAT CARE SO THAT IT WAS NOT A THING THAT I PRETEND TO GIVE BUT ONLY ACCORDING TO THE DETERMINATION OF GOD I THEREFORE PROPOSE IT STILL TO BE CONTENDED FOR
WHILE THE LOAVES WERE GIVEN TO THE PRIESTS FOR THEIR FOOD AND THE FRANKINCENSE WAS BURNT IN THAT SACRED FIRE WHEREIN ALL THEIR OFFERINGS WERE BURNT ALSO AND SO OTHER FRANKINCENSE WAS SET UPON THE LOAVES INSTEAD OF WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE
COMPASS THEM ROUND ABOUT AND KILL THEM AND WHEN HE HAD JOINED BATTLE WITH THE ENEMY HE BEAT THEM AND PURSUING THEM AS THEY FLED HE DESTROYED THEM ALL AND WHEN THAT UNDERTAKING HAD SUCCEEDED ACCORDING AS GOD HAD FORETOLD
HE SET UPON THE CITIES OF THE AMALEKITES
BUT BECAUSE HE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY AFFECTION FOR HIM FOR HE WAS HIS ELDEST SON HE WAS COMPELLED NOT TO AFFLICT HIM BUT ABSALOM WATCHED FOR A FIT OPPORTUNITY OF REVENGING THIS CRIME UPON HIM FOR HE THOROUGHLY HATED HIM
FOR HE PERSUADED HIM TO PRETEND SICKNESS AND BADE HIM WHEN HIS FATHER SHOULD COME TO HIM TO BEG OF HIM THAT HIS SISTER MIGHT COME AND MINISTER TO HIM FOR IF THAT WERE DONE HE SHOULD BE BETTER AND SHOULD QUICKLY RECOVER FROM HIS DISTEMPER
BUT THESE WERE AGAINST FAMINE AND THIRST THINGS INDEED THAT ARE IN THEIR OWN NATURE INSUPERABLE AS ALSO AGAINST MOUNTAINS AND THAT SEA WHICH AFFORDED THEM NO WAY FOR ESCAPING
ALLOWED THEM A RESPITE AND GAVE THEM LEAVE TO SEND TO WHOMSOEVER THEY PLEASED FOR ASSISTANCE SO THEY IMMEDIATELY SENT TO THE ISRAELITES CITY BY CITY AND INFORMED THEM WHAT NABASH HAD THREATENED TO DO TO THEM
AND LET THERE BE ONE COMMANDER OVER EACH NUMBER TO BE DENOMINATED FROM THE NUMBER OF THOSE OVER WHOM THEY ARE RULERS BUT SUCH AS THE WHOLE MULTITUDE HAVE TRIED AND DO APPROVE OF
AND FROM SUCH ORNAMENTS OF SPEECH ALSO AS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PLEASURE OF OUR READERS THAT THEY MAY ENTERTAIN THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WE WRITE WITH SOME AGREEABLE SATISFACTION AND PLEASURE
FOR HE LET HIM KNOW THAT GOD BESTOWS THE FRUIT OF THE VINE UPON MEN FOR GOOD WHICH WINE IS POURED OUT TO HIM AND IS THE PLEDGE OF FIDELITY AND MUTUAL CONFIDENCE AMONG MEN AND PUTS AN END TO THEIR QUARRELS TAKES AWAY PASSION AND GRIEF OUT OF THE MINDS OF THEM THAT USE IT AND MAKES THEM CHEERFUL
BECAUSE OF THE SECURITY THAT HERE AROSE FROM THE SITUATION OF THE PLACE AND BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT ALTOGETHER IMPOSSIBLE NOT ONLY TO ASCEND UP TO THE CAMP ON THAT QUARTER BUT SO MUCH AS TO COME NEAR IT AS SOON THEREFORE
THE MULTITUDE TO THEM WHILE SHE USED THESE PERSUASIONS HYRCANUS PUT OFF HER SUIT BUT AS SHE SHOWED THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN AND A CONTENTIOUS WOMAN TOO AND WOULD NOT DESIST
AND WHEN HE SAW THE SAD EXAMPLE OF HIS BRETHREN BEFORE HIM AND WAS BOTH THE INFORMER AND THE ACCUSER AGAINST THEM AT A TIME WHEN THEY MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED
BUT FORGIVE ME SAID HE AND BE MERCIFUL TO ME FOR I WILL BE CAUTIOUS HOW I OFFEND FOR THE TIME TO COME HE ALSO ENTREATED THE PROPHET TO GO BACK WITH HIM THAT HE MIGHT OFFER HIS THANK OFFERINGS TO GOD BUT SAMUEL WENT HOME
CAME TO THE ASSISTANCE OF AHAZ
BECAUSE THOU DIDST CONVICT THEFT OF THEIR WICKED DESIGNS BUT THOU DIDST NOT YIELD UP TO JUSTICE THOSE WHO WERE THEIR PARTNERS AND THEREBY DIDST MAKE IT EVIDENT TO ALL MEN THAT THOU MADEST A COVENANT WITH THEM AGAINST THY FATHER WHEN THOU CHOSEST TO BE THE ACCUSER OF THY BRETHREN
AND HE AND HIS SON STOOD ON THE OTHER SIDE AND HE SOUGHT TO DISCOVER THE OFFENDER BY LOT NOW THE LOT APPEARED TO FALL UPON JONATHAN HIMSELF SO WHEN HE WAS ASKED BY HIS FATHER WHAT SIN HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF
AND DRUSILLA TO THE KING OF COMMAGENA
AND TO ABSTAIN FROM THOSE KINDS OF FOOD WHICH CAME FROM THE KING'S TABLE AND ENTIRELY TO FORBEAR TO EAT OF ALL LIVING CREATURES
WHITHER ARISTOBULUS HAD FLED AND THENCE POMPEY SENT HIS COMMANDS TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD COME TO HIM ACCORDINGLY AT THE PERSUASIONS OF MANY THAT HE WOULD NOT MAKE WAR WITH THE ROMANS HE CAME DOWN AND WHEN HE HAD DISPUTED WITH HIS BROTHER ABOUT THE RIGHT TO THE GOVERNMENT
BUT TO CRUSH THEM BEFORE THEY GATHER STRENGTH AND COME TO BE IN PROSPERITY AND PERHAPS ATTACK THEM FIRST IN A HOSTILE MANNER AS PRESUMING UPON OUR INDOLENCE IN NOT ATTACKING THEM BEFORE AND THAT WE OUGHT TO AVENGE OURSELVES OF THEM FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE WILDERNESS
AND BECAUSE WE ARE NOT WILLING TO INJURE HIM THAT HAS THUS DISTRESSED US THOUGH IT WERE FOR OUR OWN PLEASURE THE CUPBEARER THEREFORE AS WAS NATURAL TO DO REJOICED TO HEAR SUCH AN INTERPRETATION OF HIS DREAM
AND WHAT GREAT DISTRESS THEY WERE IN NOW THE PEOPLE FELL INTO TEARS AND GRIEF AT THE HEARING OF WHAT THE AMBASSADORS FROM JABESH SAID AND THE TERROR THEY WERE IN PERMITTED THEM TO DO NOTHING MORE
THAT THEY MIGHT OFFER SACRIFICES ON THE SEVENTH DAY AND MIGHT THEN JOIN BATTLE WITH THEIR ENEMIES SO
AND SUNG HYMNS TO GOD AS TO HIM WHO HAD BEEN THE AUTHOR PROCURER OF THEIR DELIVERANCE AND THEIR FREEDOM THEY ALSO PRAISED THEIR CONDUCTOR AS HIM BY WHOSE VIRTUE IT WAS THAT ALL THINGS HAD SUCCEEDED WITH THEM
THE HEBREWS COME OUT OF THEIR DENS AND CAVES AND THEY SAID TO JONATHAN AND TO HIS ARMOR BEARER COME ON ASCEND UP TO US THAT WE MAY INFLICT A JUST PUNISHMENT UPON YOU FOR YOUR RASH ATTEMPT UPON US
TOLD ALL THEY KNEW OF HIM AND HIS RUIN WAS NOW HASTENED
HE ALSO PERMITTED HIM TO MAKE USE OF A DIET BETTER THAN THAT OF THE REST OF THE PRISONERS NOW AS HIS FELLOW PRISONERS WHEN THEIR HARD LABORS WERE OVER FELL TO DISCOURSING ONE AMONG ANOTHER AS IS USUAL IN SUCH AS ARE EQUAL SUFFERERS
IF THOU WILT GIVE ME LEAVE I WILL GO THITHER FOR THOU KNOWEST THE GOOD WILL THAT I BEAR HIM AND THEN IT WAS THAT JONATHAN UNDERSTOOD HIS FATHER'S HATRED TO DAVID AND PLAINLY SAW HIS ENTIRE DISPOSITION FOR SAUL COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIS ANGER BUT REPROACHED JONATHAN
THEY ALSO LAID THEMSELVES DOWN IN PUBLIC PLACES AND CELEBRATED GENERAL FEASTINGS WITH GARLANDS ON THEIR HEADS AND WITH OINTMENTS AND LIBATIONS TO CHARON AND DRINKING TO ONE ANOTHER FOR JOY THAT THE KING WAS EXPIRED
WHY HE HAS BESTOWED THE PRIESTHOOD ON AARON AND HIS SONS FOR
WHICH IS THE OCCASION OF HIS SILENCE NOW I SWEAR BY HIM HIMSELF THAT THOUGH HE THAT HATH COMMITTED THIS SIN SHOULD PROVE TO BE MY OWN SON JONATHAN I WILL SLAY HIM AND BY THAT MEANS WILL APPEASE THE ANGER OF GOD AGAINST US
AND SLEW ALL THAT WERE THERE WITHOUT SPARING EITHER WOMEN OR CHILDREN OR ANY OTHER AGE AND BURNT IT ONLY THERE WAS ONE SON OF AHIMELECH
AND THIS NOT IN A NATURAL WAY NEITHER SO HE ENTREATED THEM TO HAVE A REGARD TO THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES AND WISELY TO CONSIDER WHAT MISCHIEF WOULD BETIDE THEM UPON THE DEATH OF SO GOOD A CHILD AND THEIR YOUNGEST BROTHER
BOTH BY THE WORMS BREEDING IN IT AND BY ITS BITTERNESS SO DIVINE AND WONDERFUL A FOOD WAS THIS IT ALSO SUPPLIED THE WANT OF OTHER SORTS OF FOOD TO THOSE THAT FED ON IT
AND THAT AS TO ANTIPATER HIMSELF CAESAR LEFT IT TO HEROD TO ACT AS BECAME A FATHER AND A KING AND EITHER TO BANISH HIM OR TO TAKE AWAY HIS LIFE WHICH HE PLEASED WHEN HEROD HEARD THIS HE WAS SOME WHAT BETTER OUT OF THE PLEASURE HE HAD FROM THE CONTENTS OF THE LETTERS
AND TO REDUCE HER AFFECTIONS WITHIN THE RULES OF REASON BUT SHE GREW MORE UNGOVERNABLE AND EARNEST IN THE MATTER AND SINCE SHE DESPAIRED OF PERSUADING HIM SHE LAID HER HANDS UPON HIM AND HAD A MIND TO FORCE HIM BUT AS SOON AS JOSEPH HAD GOT AWAY FROM HER ANGER
HE MET THE ARMY BEFORE THE CITY WALLS AND WITH A LOUD VOICE TOLD THEM THAT THEY HAD GOTTEN THE VICTORY NOT BY THEIR OWN STRENGTH BUT BY REASON OF THE ANGER GOD HAD AGAINST KING AHAZ
FOR A TERRIBLE CONTENTION SHALL POSSESS THEM ONE WITH ANOTHER AND LAMENTATION AND LOOSING OF THE MEMBERS AND THEIR COUNTENANCES SHALL BE PERFECTLY BLACK WITH FEAR AND THERE WILL BE THE DEN OF THE LIONS AND THE MOTHER OF THE YOUNG LIONS
THAT THEY SHALL BE BEATEN AND HOW VALUABLE GOD'S ASSISTANCE IS THEY HAD EXPERIENCED IN ABUNDANCE OF TRIALS AND THOSE SUCH AS WERE MORE TERRIBLE THAN WAR FOR THAT IS ONLY AGAINST MEN
SO DID HE KNOW THAT HIS FATHER WAS IN LIKE MANNER DESIROUS ALSO TO HAVE HIM FOUND ENTIRELY INNOCENT BUT ANTIPATER FELL DOWN ON HIS FACE AND APPEALED TO GOD AND TO ALL MEN FOR TESTIMONIALS OF HIS INNOCENCY DESIRING THAT GOD WOULD DECLARE BY SOME EVIDENT SIGNALS THAT HE HAD NOT LAID ANY PLOT AGAINST HIS FATHER
AND THAT THIS WILL ALLEVIATE DEATH TO A GREAT DEGREE THUS TO COME AT IT BY THE PERFORMANCE OF BRAVE ACTIONS WHICH BRING US INTO DANGER OF IT AND AT THE SAME TIME TO LEAVE THAT REPUTATION BEHIND THEM TO THEIR CHILDREN AND TO ALL THEIR RELATIONS WHETHER THEY BE MEN OR WOMEN
BUT ONLY IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM MORE USEFUL IN THEIR SERVICE THAT AS FOR HIMSELF HE SHALL NOT BE SO MUCH CONCERNED FOR HIS OWN PRESERVATION FOR IF HE DIE UNJUSTLY HE SHALL NOT RECKON IT ANY AFFLICTION BUT THAT HE IS CONCERNED FOR THEM LEST BY CASTING STONES AT HIM
AND THIS BY GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON HIM FOR HIS SINS FOR A FIRE GLOWED IN HIM SLOWLY WHICH DID NOT SO MUCH APPEAR TO THE TOUCH OUTWARDLY AS IT AUGMENTED HIS PAINS INWARDLY
NOW AFTER SAUL HAD DENOUNCED THIS CURSE
AND HE EXPECTED A PREDICTION LIKE TO THAT OF THE CUPBEARER BUT JOSEPH CONSIDERING AND REASONING ABOUT THE DREAM SAID TO HIM THAT HE WOULD WILLINGLY BE AN INTERPRETER OF GOOD EVENTS TO HIM AND NOT OF SUCH AS HIS DREAM DENOUNCED TO HIM BUT HE TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD ONLY THREE DAYS IN ALL TO LIVE
AND KNOWING THAT HIS BROTHER HAD BEEN MADE PARTAKER OF THE PRIESTHOOD AT THE COMMAND OF GOD AND NOT BY HIS OWN FAVOR TO HIM HE CAME TO THE ASSEMBLY AND AS FOR THE MULTITUDE HE SAID NOT A WORD TO THEM
AND THAT HE MADE A LEAGUE OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THOSE ARABIANS AND GAZITES AND ASCALONITES THAT WERE OF HIS OWN PARTY AND HAD BY MANY AND LARGE PRESENTS MADE THEM HIS FAST FRIENDS BUT NOW THIS YOUNGER ANTIPATER WAS SUSPICIOUS OF THE POWER OF ARISTOBULUS
DON'T YOU THINK PERHAPS YOU HAD ALMOST BETTER GO NOW HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT HE COULD NOT BEAR HIMSELF AS A MAN IF THE STRAIN CONTINUED MUCH LONGER I DON'T DESERVE ANYTHING ELSE I'LL GO DICK
A LITTLE PATCHING AND REPAIRING FROM TIME TO TIME IS ALL WE WANT AN OCULIST BY ALL MEANS DICK SOUGHT AN OCULIST THE BEST IN LONDON HE WAS CERTAIN THAT THE LOCAL PRACTITIONER DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIS TRADE
THEY SAID THEY WERE ARTISTS AND I KNEW SOME OF THEM COULD DRAW BUT THEY WOULDN'T DRAW THEY GAVE ME TEA TEA AT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON AND TALKED ABOUT ART AND THE STATE OF THEIR SOULS
AN AFFABLE ACTRESS A DEVASTATING CYCLONE OR MINE OWN SWEET SELF AND YOU PRESUME TO LECTURE ME ABOUT MY WORK NILGHAI IF IT WERE WORTH WHILE I'D CARICATURE YOU IN FOUR PAPERS
IT'S THERE BLESS ITS GOLDEN HEART SAID DICK IT'S THERE ALL THE TIME PROVIDENCE HAS SENT ME NUTS WHILE I HAVE TEETH TO CRACK EM WITH I HAVEN'T YET FOUND THE NUT I WISH TO CRACK BUT I'M KEEPING MY TEETH FILED
THE MARK OF MUDDY FEET ON THE DAIS SHOWED THAT A MILITARY MODEL HAD JUST GONE AWAY THE WATERY AUTUMN SUNLIGHT WAS FALLING AND SHADOWS SAT IN THE CORNERS OF THE STUDIO YES
IT'S WINDY DIET FOR A COLT I DON'T THINK IT AFFECTS DICK MUCH YOU MIGHT AS WELL CALL A YOUNG WOLF A LION AND EXPECT HIM TO TAKE THE COMPLIMENT IN EXCHANGE FOR A SHIN BONE DICK'S SOUL IS IN THE BANK
I NEVER MEANT TO WORRY YOU ANY MORE WHAT'S THE MATTER HE WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MAISIE WAS CATCHING HER BREATH BUT WAS AS UNPREPARED AS HERSELF FOR THE TORRENT OF EMOTION THAT FOLLOWED
THERE ARE THE MAKINGS OF A VERY FINE PRIG IN YOU DICK SAID THE NILGHAI I'VE LIBERATED MY MIND ESTIMABLE BINKIE WITH THE FEATHERS IN HIS MOUTH DICK PICKED UP THE STILL INDIGNANT ONE AND SHOOK HIM TENDERLY
I SHOULD HAVE STAYED AND MADE LOVE TO YOU THE GIRL SAT WITH HER CHIN ON HER HAND SCOWLING
DICK STOPPING EVERY NOW AND AGAIN TO DRAG FORTH LONG NEGLECTED CANVASES AND OLD NOTE BOOKS FOR HE TURNED TO HIS WORK BY INSTINCT AS A THING THAT COULD NOT FAIL YOU WON'T DO AND YOU WON'T DO HE SAID AT EACH INSPECTION NO MORE SOLDIERS
AS IF THEIR SOULS MATTERED I'VE HEARD MORE ABOUT ART AND SEEN LESS OF HER IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS THAN IN THE WHOLE OF MY LIFE DO YOU REMEMBER CASSAVETTI WHO WORKED FOR SOME CONTINENTAL SYNDICATE OUT WITH THE DESERT COLUMN
EATING HIS MOUSTACHE AND WONDERING WHAT THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT WOULD BE LIKE
AND HE PITCHED GRUNTING AT THEIR FEET DICK LAUGHED AGAIN REMEMBERING THE HORROR IT SEEMED SO EXACTLY LIKE HIS OWN CASE BUT I HAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME ALLOWED ME HE SAID HE PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM QUIETLY AT FIRST BUT AFTERWARDS
DICK WATCHED THE SPOT TILL HE HEARD THE VOICE OF THE TIDE BETWEEN THE PIERS DIE DOWN LIKE THE WASH OF THE SEA AT LOW TIDE
WITH HIS HELMET AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND THE LIVING FEAR OF DEATH IN HIS EYE AND THE BLOOD OOZING OUT OF A CUT OVER HIS ANKLE BONE HE WASN'T PRETTY BUT HE WAS ALL SOLDIER AND VERY MUCH MAN
STILL LOOKING OUT ON THE DARKNESS MY GOD WHAT A CITY TO LOOT BINKIE FOUND THE NIGHT AIR TICKLING HIS WHISKERS AND SNEEZED PLAINTIVELY
I COULDN'T PAINT EM SUDDEN DEATH COMES HOME TOO NEARLY AND THIS IS BATTLE AND MURDER FOR ME THE DAY WAS FAILING AND DICK THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT THAT THE TWILIGHT OF THE BLIND HAD COME UPON HIM UNAWARE ALLAH ALMIGHTY HE CRIED DESPAIRINGLY
THE DOCTOR'S HAND TOUCHED THE SCAR OF THE SWORD CUT ON DICK'S HEAD AND DICK EXPLAINED BRIEFLY HOW HE HAD COME BY IT WHEN THE FLAME WAS REMOVED DICK SAW THE DOCTOR'S FACE AND THE FEAR CAME UPON HIM AGAIN THE DOCTOR WRAPPED HIMSELF IN A MIST OF WORDS
YOU'RE PLEASED TO DAY SAID BESSIE DICK WAVED HIS MAHL STICK IN MYSTIC CIRCLES AND WENT TO THE SIDEBOARD FOR A DRINK IN THE EVENING WHEN THE EXALTATION OF THE DAY HAD DIED DOWN HE WENT TO THE SIDEBOARD AGAIN AND AFTER SOME VISITS BECAME CONVINCED
THEY WERE ALL SINGING NOW DICK WITH THE ROAR OF THE WIND OF THE OPEN SEA ABOUT HIS EARS AS THE DEEP BASS VOICE LET ITSELF GO
I SHOULDN'T GO I DON'T CARE TO PROFIT BY THE PRICE OF A MAN'S SOUL FOR THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD MEAN DICK IT'S NO USE ARGUING YOU'RE A FOOL DON'T SEE IT WHEN I WAS ON THAT CHINESE PIG BOAT
AND DON'T SNEEZE IN MY EYE BECAUSE I TALK LATIN GOOD NIGHT HE WENT OUT OF THE ROOM THAT'S DISTINCTLY ONE FOR YOU SAID THE NILGHAI I TOLD YOU IT WAS HOPELESS TO MEDDLE WITH HIM HE'S NOT PLEASED
I MUST CARRY THIS BUSINESS THROUGH ALONE AS USUAL IF THERE ISN'T A WAR AND TORP FINDS OUT
AS HE ENTERED THE DARK HALL THAT LED TO THE CONSULTING ROOM A MAN CANNONED AGAINST HIM DICK SAW THE FACE AS IT HURRIED OUT INTO THE STREET THAT'S THE WRITER TYPE HE HAS THE SAME MODELLING OF THE FOREHEAD AS TORP HE LOOKS VERY SICK
TORPENHOW NUDGED DICK GOOD PLACE TO BANK IN BAD PLACE TO BUNK IN DICKIE ISN'T IT
EVERY PULSE OF DICK'S BODY THROBBED FURIOUSLY AND HIS PALATE DRIED IN HIS MOUTH THE FOG SHUT DOWN AGAIN AND MAISIE'S FACE WAS PEARL WHITE THROUGH IT NO WORD WAS SPOKEN

THAT IF HIS FATE WERE BLINDNESS ALL THE TORPENHOWS IN THE WORLD COULD NOT SAVE HIM I CAN'T CALL HIM OFF HIS TRIP TO SIT DOWN AND SYMPATHISE WITH ME I MUST PULL THROUGH THIS BUSINESS ALONE HE SAID HE WAS LYING ON THE SOFA
BUT I CAN'T OH DICKIE YOU WOULDN'T ASK ME WOULD YOU WAILED MAISIE SHE LOOKED UP FOR A MINUTE AND BY CHANCE IT HAPPENED THAT DICK'S EYES FELL ON HERS

THAT CAVALRY CAN ATTACK AND CRUMPLE AND BREAK UNSHAKEN INFANTRY WHENEVER HE WAS INCLINED TO THINK OVER A LIFE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER AN INCOME THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LARGER AND A SOUL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLY CLEANER

SHE WAS IMMENSELY AND UNFEIGNEDLY SORRY FOR HIM MORE SORRY THAN SHE HAD EVER BEEN FOR ANY ONE IN HER LIFE BUT NOT SORRY ENOUGH TO DENY HIS WORDS SO
UNDERSTAND THE SPEECH AND FEEL A STIR OF FELLOWSHIP IN ALL DISASTROUS FIGHT IN ALL DISASTROUS FIGHT THAT'S BETTER THAN PAINTING THE THING MERELY TO PIQUE MAISIE I CAN DO IT NOW BECAUSE I HAVE IT INSIDE ME
ALLAH FORBID I SHALL GET AWAY BEFORE THAT TIME COMES GIVE A MAN ROOM TO STRETCH HIS LEGS MISTER BINKIE DICK FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN ON THE SOFA AND TWEAKED BINKIE'S VELVET EARS YAWNING HEAVILY THE WHILE

ON THE BOWS OF THE RICKETY BOAT FROM LIMA IN THE DAYS WHEN DICK WAS MIXING PAINTS MAKING LOVE DRAWING DEVILS AND ANGELS IN THE HALF DARK AND WONDERING WHETHER THE NEXT MINUTE WOULD PUT THE ITALIAN CAPTAIN'S KNIFE BETWEEN HIS SHOULDER BLADES
AND GRASPING A HANDFUL OF DICK GENERALLY OVER THE RIGHT RIBS SOFT AS PUTTY PURE TALLOW BORN OF OVER FEEDING TRAIN IT OFF DICKIE
HEAR HIM BLASPHEMING HIS FIRST LOVE WHY IN THE WORLD SHOULDN'T YOU LISTEN TO HER SAID TORPENHOW BEFORE DICK COULD REPLY THE NILGHAI LIFTED UP HIS VOICE WITH A SHOUT THAT SHOOK THE WINDOWS IN THE MEN OF THE SEA THAT BEGINS AS ALL KNOW

SWINGING HER HAUNCHES AND GRACEFULLY SWAYING A SHAPE THE HANDIWORK OF HIM WHOSE BOONS ARE HIDDEN AND EACH OF THEM STOLE ONE GLANCE OF THE EYES THAT COST THEM A THOUSAND SIGHS
BY NO LAW OF OURS AT ALL AT ALL AND IF THOU BE IGNORANT OF THE RELIGIOUS LAW I WILL ACT AS THINE ADVOCATE THEN THEY WENT TO THE DIVORCE COURT
AND WHEN HE BROUGHT THEM THE MAN WEIGHED OUT THE MONEY AND HANDED IT TO ME AFTER WHICH HE WENT HIS WAY THEN I CALLED THE PURVEYORS AND PAID THEM MY LIABILITIES
AND CAST IN SHAPELIEST MOULD HATH STORMED MY HEART WITH HONIED LURE AND HONIED WORDS OF GRACE NO REST MY HEART HATH KNOWN SINCE THOU ART GONE NOR EVER CLOSE THESE EYES NOR PATIENCE ALOE SCAPE THE HOPES I DARE TO TRACE
THEY ANSWERED TWAS BOUND FROM EGYPT FOR BAGHDAD AND HE SAID RETURN YE TO THE SLAIN FOR METHINKS THE OWNER OF THIS CARAVAN IS NOT DEAD SO THEY TURNED BACK TO THE SLAIN
WHEN IT WAS THE THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVENTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT IBRAHIM SON OF AL MAHDI CONTINUED NOW WHEN THE HOUSEMASTER HEARD MY NAME HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND SAID
AND HE BECAME AS ONE DRUNKEN WITH SLUMBER AND WHILE HE WAS ON THIS WISE
AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY WHEN IT WAS THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIXTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING
NI'AMAH SON OF AL RABI'A OF CUFA AND HER HEALTH DEPENDETH ON HER SEEING HIM FOR NAUGHT AILETH HER BUT LOVING HIM AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY HER PERMITTED SAY
BUT HARDLY HAD IT SETTLED WELL IN HIS STOMACH WHEN HIS HEAD FORWENT BOTH HIS FEET
I WILL NOT SIT I ASKED AND WHAT IS THAT AND SHE ANSWERED NONE MAY KNOW LOVERS SECRETS AND PUTTING HER MOUTH TO JUBAYR'S EAR WHISPERED TO HIM WHERE UPON HE REPLIED
IN WHICH HE LAID DOWN AXIOMS OF TRADE AND SERENELY FOLLOWED THEM OUT TO THEIR FULL CONSEQUENCES THE DISCORD JARRED UPON HER INEXPRESSIBLY THE MORE BECAUSE OF THE GATHERING WOE OF WHICH SHE HEARD FROM BESSY
BUT YOU ARE HARDLY ACQUAINTED WITH OUR DARKSHIRE FELLOWS FOR ALL YOU'RE A DARKSHIRE MAN YOURSELF THEY HAVE SUCH A SENSE OF HUMOUR AND SUCH A RACY MODE OF EXPRESSION
AND AT DINNER TO DAY A LIGHTER CLEVERER MORE WORLDLY MAN AND AS SUCH DISSONANT TO MISTER HALE IT WAS A RELIEF TO ALL THREE
THEY WERE ALL DRAWN TOWARDS THE HOUSE DOOR BY SOME IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE IMPELLED THITHER NOT BY A POOR CURIOSITY BUT AS IF BY SOME SOLEMN BLAST SIX MEN WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD
JUST AS WE DID A CORRECT SUM AT SCHOOL ON THE SLATE
HE HAD RESUMED HIS PIPE AND PUT HIS WELL IN THE FORM OF AN INTERROGATION WHY SHE WENT ON WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THE FARMERS HE PUFFED AWAY I RECKON THEY'D HAVE EITHER TO GIVE UP THEIR FARMS OR TO GIVE FAIR RATE OF WAGE
MARGARET KNEW IT WAS SOME POACHER SITTING UP IN HER BED ROOM THIS PAST AUTUMN WITH THE LIGHT OF HER CANDLE EXTINGUISHED AND PURELY REVELLING IN THE SOLEMN BEAUTY OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH SHE HAD MANY A TIME SEEN THE LIGHT NOISELESS LEAP OF THE POACHERS
MISSUS THORNTON WAS NOT A WOMAN MUCH GIVEN TO REASONING HER QUICK JUDGMENT AND FIRM RESOLUTION SERVED HER IN GOOD STEAD OF ANY LONG ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH HERSELF SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT NOTHING COULD STRENGTHEN FANNY TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS PATIENTLY
I'LL WRITE AND TELL HER SHE MUST THE GIRL MUST HAVE SOME WOMAN FRIEND ABOUT HER IF ONLY TO TALK HER INTO A GOOD FIT OF CRYING DIXON WAS CRYING ENOUGH FOR TWO
BUT AT LAST SHE DETERMINED TO TAKE HER MIND AWAY FROM THE PRESENT AND SUDDENLY REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD A LETTER FROM EDITH WHICH SHE HAD ONLY HALF READ IN THE BUSTLE OF THE MORNING IT WAS TO TELL OF THEIR ARRIVAL AT CORFU
ARE YOU OUT OF WORK ASKED MARGARET AY HE REPLIED SHORTLY
HER TEETH WERE SHUT NOT COMPRESSED HER LIPS WERE JUST PARTED OVER THEM ALLOWING THE WHITE LINE TO BE SEEN BETWEEN THEIR CURVE HER SLOW DEEP BREATHINGS DILATED HER THIN AND BEAUTIFUL NOSTRILS IT WAS THE ONLY MOTION VISIBLE
IMPATIENT BY HER AUNT'S SIDE WHILE THAT LADY WAS MAKING SOME IMPORTANT AND INTERMINABLE DECISION NAY ABSOLUTELY PAST ACQUAINTANCES IN THE STREETS FOR THOUGH THE MORNING HAD BEEN OF AN INCALCULABLE LENGTH TO THEM
HE WAS WITH MAMMA WHEN SHE DIED SAID MARGARET SOFTLY TO BE SURE TO BE SURE WHY SOME ONE ASKED ME IF HE HAD NOT BEEN OVER THEN
CARESSING IT AND KISSING IT AS IF TO COMFORT MISSUS HALE CRIED WITHOUT RESTRAINT AT LAST SHE SAT STRAIGHT STIFF UP ON THE SOFA
WITH WHICH MISTER THORNTON HAD STARTED HER MERCHANTS BE LIKE PRINCES SAID HIS MOTHER READING THE TEXT ALOUD AS IF IT WERE A TRUMPET CALL TO INVITE HER BOY TO THE STRUGGLE HE WAS BUT LIKE MANY OTHERS
WHILE HERE NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES FOR US ENOUGH TO NOTICE WHAT WE DO
MARGARET ROSE FROM HER SEAT AND BEGAN SILENTLY TO FOLD UP HER WORK THE LONG SEAMS WERE HEAVY AND HAD AN UNUSUAL WEIGHT FOR HER LANGUID ARMS THE ROUND LINES IN HER FACE TOOK A LENGTHENED STRAIGHTER FORM
SHE HAD HEARD IT ALL HER LIFE BUT IT WERE VERY CRUEL FOR ALL THAT MARGARET GAVE IT UP IN DESPAIR AND WALKED AWAY SICK AT HEART YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL NOT TO TRIUMPH OVER ME SAID MISTER BELL
THEY HAD BEEN SMOTHERED AND KEPT DOWN BUT THEY WERE NOT EXTINCT AND SHE LIKED TO THINK OF SEEING MARGARET DRESSED FOR A PARTY AND DISCUSSED WHAT SHE SHOULD WEAR WITH AN UNSETTLED ANXIETY THAT AMUSED MARGARET WHO HAD BEEN MORE ACCUSTOMED TO SOCIETY
AND I WAS UNDONE WITH ANXIETY AND AFRAID TOO THAT I MIGHT HAVE DRAWN HIM INTO DANGER AND WE HAD AN ALARM JUST AFTER HER DEATH FOR DIXON MET SOME ONE IN MILTON A MAN CALLED LEONARDS WHO HAD KNOWN FRED AND WHO SEEMED TO OWE HIM A GRUDGE
EVERYTHING WENT ON WITH THE REGULARITY OF CLOCKWORK ONCE A YEAR THERE WAS A LONG DISCUSSION BETWEEN HER AUNT AND EDITH AS TO WHETHER THEY SHOULD GO TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT ABROAD OR TO SCOTLAND BUT AT SUCH TIMES MARGARET HERSELF WAS SECURE OF DRIFTING WITHOUT ANY
AND I SHOULD NA HA MINDED IF SOME ONE ELSE HAD DONE THE DIRTY WORK AND GOT HIM CLAPPED UP BUT NOW HE HAS STRUCKEN ME I COULD DO IT LESS NOR EVER FOR IT WOULD BE GETTING OTHER MEN TO TAKE UP MY QUARREL BUT IF EVER HE GETS WELL O'ER THIS CLEMMING
NE'ER MEETS A MAN BOUT AN OATH OR A CURSE
MISS WHO REPLIED MISTER THORNTON MISS MARGET MISS HALE
THE OLD SERVANT HAD BEEN BUSILY ENGAGED IN WINDING UP ALL THE AFFAIRS OF THE HALE FAMILY IT HAD APPEARED A SUDDEN FAMINE TO HER HEART THIS ENTIRE CESSATION OF ANY NEWS RESPECTING THE PEOPLE AMONGST WHOM SHE HAD LIVED SO LONG
JOHNNY'S CRY WAS LOUDEST OF THEM ALL THOUGH HE KNEW NOT WHY HE CRIED POOR LITTLE FELLOW THE MOTHER QUIVERED AS SHE LAY IN MARGARET'S ARMS MARGARET HEARD A NOISE AT THE DOOR OPEN IT
SHE PLANNED AND PROMISED AND LED HER MOTHER ON TO ARRANGE FULLY AS MUCH AS COULD BE FIXED BEFORE THEY KNEW SOMEWHAT MORE DEFINITIVELY WHAT MISTER HALE INTENDED TO DO THROUGHOUT THE DAY MARGARET NEVER LEFT HER MOTHER
HERE WE GO UP UP UP AND HERE WE GO DOWN DOWN DOWNEE NURSERY SONG MEANWHILE AT MILTON THE CHIMNEYS SMOKED THE CEASELESS ROAR AND MIGHTY BEAT AND DIZZYING WHIRL OF MACHINERY
WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH TO SAY IN A HALF HUMBLE HALF INJURED TONE MAYN'T I UNFASTEN YOUR GOWN MISS AND DO YOUR HAIR NO NOT TO NIGHT THANK YOU
AS IF I WERE ALWAYS THINKING THAT HE CARED FOR ME WHEN I KNOW HE DOES NOT HE CANNOT HIS MOTHER WILL HAVE SAID ALL THOSE CRUEL THINGS ABOUT ME TO HIM BUT I WON'T CARE FOR HIM
AND SHE WAS CONSEQUENTLY RATHER INCLINED TO FANCY HERSELF ILL BUT ALL THE REST OF THE FAMILY WERE IN THE FULL BUSINESS OF THE LONDON SEASON AND MARGARET WAS OFTEN LEFT ALONE THEN HER THOUGHTS WENT BACK TO MILTON
AS I WAS O MY WORK SOMETIMES I'M SO TIRED OUT I THINK I CANNOT ENJOY HEAVEN WITHOUT A PIECE OF REST FIRST
HE OPENED THE ROOM DOOR AND STOOD THERE UNCERTAIN WHETHER TO COME IN HIS FACE WAS GRAY AND PALE HE HAD A TIMID FEARFUL LOOK IN HIS EYES SOMETHING ALMOST PITIFUL TO SEE IN A MAN'S FACE
NOT FAR OFF IT IS HALF PAST NINE YOU HAD BETTER GO TO BED AT ONCE DEAR ASK DIXON FOR SOME GRUEL I WILL COME AND SEE YOU AS SOON AS YOU ARE IN BED
MISERABLE UNRESTING NIGHT ILL PREPARATION FOR THE COMING DAY SHE AWOKE WITH A START UNREFRESHED AND CONSCIOUS OF SOME REALITY WORSE EVEN THAN HER FEVERISH DREAMS
WHY MISTER THORNTON YOU'RE CUTTING ME VERY COOLLY I MUST SAY AND HOW IS MISSUS THORNTON BRAVE WEATHER THIS WE DOCTORS DON'T LIKE IT I CAN TELL YOU I BEG YOUR PARDON DOCTOR DONALDSON I REALLY DIDN'T SEE YOU MY MOTHER'S QUITE WELL THANK YOU
THERE WERE THE THREE HARD FACTS HARDLY SPOKEN WHAT MAKES YOU SAY SO
AND WERE BROUGHT INTO SOME KIND OF INTERCOURSE WITH THEM
AND FOR THAT SAID MARGARET STEPPING FORWARDS FOR ANYTHING YOU COULD DO HIGGINS WITH THE BEST WILL IN THE WORLD YOU WOULD
SAID MARGARET TURNING A LITTLE PALE I NEVER SAW A DEAD PERSON NO I WOULD RATHER NOT
I SHOULD JUST LIKE TO HAVE IT OUT WITH THAT YOUNG FELLOW A
AND PREPARED FOR THE WANDERER'S REFRESHMENT
BUT IT WAS EVIDENT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHERE SHE WAS NOR WHO THEY WERE THE DARK CIRCLES DEEPENED THE LIPS QUIVERED AND CONTRACTED AND SHE BECAME INSENSIBLE ONCE MORE
STILL THERE WAS MUCH TO ADMIRE IN THEIR FORGETFULNESS OF THEMSELVES AND THE PRESENT IN THEIR ANTICIPATED TRIUMPHS OVER ALL INANIMATE MATTER AT SOME FUTURE TIME WHICH NONE OF THEM SHOULD LIVE TO SEE
WELL CLEANSED AND WELL CARED FOR MACHINERY AND UNWASHED AND NEGLECTED HANDS POOR OLD HALE POOR OLD HALE IF YOU COULD HAVE KNOWN THE CHANGE WHICH IT WAS TO HIM FROM HELSTONE
INDEED MA'AM I'M SURE IT WILL BE YOUR DEATH BEFORE LONG AND THEN I KNOW WHO'LL STAY
MISSUS THORNTON WAS SHY IT WAS ONLY OF LATE YEARS THAT SHE HAD HAD LEISURE ENOUGH IN HER LIFE TO GO INTO SOCIETY AND AS SOCIETY SHE DID NOT ENJOY IT
ACCORDINGLY MARGARET WENT MISSUS BOUCHER WAS VERY ILL REALLY ILL NOT MERELY AILING THE KIND AND SENSIBLE NEIGHBOUR WHO HAD COME IN THE OTHER DAY SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING SOME OF THE CHILDREN WERE GONE TO THE NEIGHBOURS
OR AN ERRAND BOY HE WAS THINKING I WILL NOT BE DAUNTED FROM DOING AS I CHOOSE BY THE THOUGHT OF HER
MARY WAS HUMBLY SOBBING IN THE BACK GROUND THEY WENT DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT A WORD
I HEAR OF HER THROUGH HER AGENT HERE EVERY NOW AND THEN SHE'S WELL AND AMONG FRIENDS THANK YOU HIGGINS THAT THANK YOU THAT LINGERED AFTER THE OTHER WORDS
MISTER THORNTON WAS SILENT THEN HE SAID I REALLY DON'T KNOW BUT MONEY IS NOT WHAT I STRIVE FOR WHAT THEN IT IS A HOME QUESTION
NOT A TENDER FRIEND THAT I CANNOT BE
MARGARET'S HEART BLED TO HEAR THAT THE MOTHER IN HER SELFISH REQUIREMENT OF SYMPATHY HAD TAKEN HER CHILDREN UPSTAIRS TO SEE THEIR DISFIGURED FATHER IT WAS INTERMINGLING THE COARSENESS OF HORROR WITH THE PROFOUNDNESS OF NATURAL GRIEF SHE TRIED TO TURN THEIR THOUGHTS IN SOME OTHER DIRECTION
FOR FEMININE SHOPPING MANY A YOUNG LADY OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE TURNED TO LOOK AFTER HIM AND THOUGHT IT STRANGE TO SEE HIM OCCUPIED
HE TOOK FREDERICK'S HAND IN BOTH OF HIS MY BOY YOU MUST GO IT IS VERY BAD BUT I SEE YOU MUST YOU HAVE DONE ALL YOU COULD YOU HAVE BEEN A COMFORT TO HER
YESTERDAY ONLY YESTERDAY REPLIED MARGARET DETECTING THE JEALOUSY WHICH PROMPTED THE INQUIRY POOR PAPA TRYING TO DIVERT HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS INTO COMPASSIONATE SYMPATHY FOR ALL HER FATHER HAD GONE THROUGH MISSUS HALE RAISED HER HEAD
WHAT THEY DOES THEY DOES
AND SHE CRIED WITHOUT RESTRAINT HE COULD NOT SYMPATHISE WITH HER HIS ANGER HAD NOT ABATED IT WAS RATHER RISING THE MORE AS HIS SENSE OF IMMEDIATE DANGER WAS PASSING AWAY
DUNNOT BE A FOOL SAYS HE WORDS COME READIER THAN DEEDS TO MOST MEN
WHAT CAN YOU DO BE ALWAYS THE SAME JOHN THORNTON IN WHATEVER CIRCUMSTANCES ENDEAVOURING TO DO RIGHT AND MAKING GREAT BLUNDERS AND THEN TRYING TO BE BRAVE IN SETTING TO AFRESH BUT IT IS HARD MOTHER
WHILE HE IS HERE THEY'LL BE CLEVER IF THEY COME IN PAST ME SAID DIXON SHOWING HER TEETH AT THE BARE IDEA
HE CROSSED TO THE PORTER'S LODGE HOW LONG HAS THAT MAN HIGGINS BEEN WAITING TO SPEAK TO ME
WHEN SHE WAS AGITATED HER SISTER MARY WAS TYING ON HER BONNET IN GREAT CLUMSY BOWS AS SUITED HER GREAT CLUMSY FINGERS TO GO TO HER FUSTIAN CUTTING BLUBBERING OUT LOUD THE WHILE
SO DUNNOT TURN FAINT HEART
THEY'D TELL US TO MIND OUR OWN BUSINESS AND THEY'D MIND THEIRS OUR BUSINESS BEING
HIS BUSINESS IS LARGE EXTENDING EVERY YEAR BUT SUCH A HEAD AS HE HAS AND SO PRUDENT WITH ALL HIS DARING THEN ONE MAN DRAWS ANOTHER ASIDE AND WALKS A LITTLE APART
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT SAID MARGARET YOU ONLY DO ME JUSTICE AND YOU'LL NOT FORGET ME I'M SURE IF NO ONE ELSE IN MILTON REMEMBERS ME I'M CERTAIN YOU WILL AND PAPA TOO
MARGARET WAS READY LONG BEFORE THE APPOINTED TIME AND HAD LEISURE ENOUGH TO CRY A LITTLE QUIETLY WHEN UNOBSERVED AND TO SMILE BRIGHTLY WHEN ANY ONE LOOKED AT HER
SO I SAY HOORAY FOR THE STRIKE AND LET THORNTON AND SLICKSON AND HAMPER AND THEIR SET LOOK TO IT THORNTON SAID MARGARET MISTER THORNTON OF MARLBOROUGH STREET AYE
BUT MARGARET HAD NOT A THOUGHT OF FEAR IN HER PRE OCCUPIED MIND A MAN'S TALL FIGURE STOOD BETWEEN HER AND THE LUMINOUS STREET HE WAS LOOKING AWAY BUT AT THE SOUND OF THE LATCH HE TURNED QUICKLY ROUND IS THIS MISTER HALE'S SAID HE IN A CLEAR FULL DELICATE VOICE
MARGARET DID NOT THINK OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE UTTERLY UNREASONABLE IN THIS SPEECH WE DO NOT LOOK FOR REASON OR LOGIC IN THE PASSIONATE ENTREATIES OF THOSE WHO ARE SICK UNTO DEATH
SHE SNORTED SCORNFULLY OVER THE PICTURE OF THE BEAUTY OF HER VICTIM HER JET BLACK HAIR HER CLEAR SMOOTH SKIN HER LUCID EYES WOULD NOT HELP TO SAVE HER ONE WORD OF THE JUST AND STERN REPROACH
AND OF THINKING HER OWN THOUGHTS WHILE SHE RESTED INSTEAD OF ANXIOUSLY WATCHING ANOTHER PERSON TO LEARN WHETHER TO BE GRAVE OR GAY AFTER TEA SHE RESOLVED TO EXAMINE A LARGE PACKET OF LETTERS AND PICK OUT THOSE THAT WERE TO BE DESTROYED
I TELL YO AGAIN I SAW YO AS PLAINLY COMING SWIFTLY TOWARDS ME WI YO'R HAIR BLOWN BACK WI THE VERY SWIFTNESS O THE MOTION
DID SHE GET THERE NAY MISS THAT'S NOT FOR ME TO SAY ANSWERED JANE WITH A SLIGHT TOSS OF HER HEAD SARAH DID' SARAH WHAT SAID FANNY WITH IMPATIENT CURIOSITY
SOMETIMES AMUSED AND QUESTIONING AT OTHERS A LITTLE INCLINED TO COMPARE HER SISTER'S CIRCUMSTANCES OF EASE AND COMFORT WITH THE NARROWER MEANS AT HELSTONE VICARAGE ON SUCH EVENINGS MARGARET WAS APT TO STOP TALKING RATHER ABRUPTLY
OF IGNORANCE IF SHE USED A NAME WHICH HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
I'D HAD GOOD CHANCES OF MATRIMONY
SHREWD IGNORANT BUT ABOVE ALL FULL OF CHARACTER AND STRONG HUMAN FEELING HE REVIEWED HIS POSITION AS A MILTON MANUFACTURER THE STRIKE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO OR MORE
YOU MUST NOT GO TO THE SOUTH SAID MARGARET FOR ALL THAT YOU COULD NOT STAND IT
THAT IF HER FATHER BEGAN TO SPEAK EVER SO MILDLY ON THE SUBJECT OF HIGGINS'S THOUGHTS THE LATTER WOULD CONSIDER HIMSELF CHALLENGED TO AN ARGUMENT AND WOULD FEEL HIMSELF BOUND TO MAINTAIN HIS OWN GROUND
OF CONTINUALLY ARRANGING SOME PART OF HER GOWN HER WANDERING EYES NOW GLANCING HERE NOW THERE BUT WITHOUT ANY PURPOSE IN HER OBSERVATION AND HE CONTRASTED THEM UNEASILY
WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE HOUSE SERVANT ALONG THE PASSAGE AND THROUGH THE KITCHEN STEPPING CAUTIOUSLY ON EVERY DARK MARK IN THE PATTERN OF THE OIL CLOTH IN ORDER TO CONCEAL HIS DIRTY FOOT PRINTS MARGARET RAN UPSTAIRS SHE MET DIXON ON THE LANDING HOW IS MAMMA WHERE IS PAPA
WHICH HE COULD ONLY DO BY AN INTERVIEW WITH THE LATTER GENTLEMAN MARGARET KNEW THAT THEY OUGHT TO BE REMOVING BUT SHE HAD A REPUGNANCE TO THE IDEA OF A MANUFACTURING TOWN AND BELIEVED THAT HER MOTHER WAS RECEIVING BENEFIT FROM HESTON AIR SO SHE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE DEFERRED THE EXPEDITION TO MILTON
SAID HIGGINS ONE DAY AS HE HEARD MISTER THORNTON'S SHORT SHARP INQUIRY WHY SUCH A COMMAND HAD NOT BEEN OBEYED AND CAUGHT THE SOUND OF THE SUPPRESSED SIGH WHICH HE HEAVED IN GOING PAST THE ROOM WHERE SOME OF THE MEN WERE WORKING
SHE READ THIS MEANING TOO IN THE MAN'S EYES I'M NONE SO FOND OF HAVING STRANGE FOLK IN MY HOUSE BUT THEN RELENTING AS HE SAW HER HEIGHTENED COLOUR HE ADDED YO'RE A FOREIGNER AS ONE MAY SAY
THESE VISIONS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN DWELLING ON WITH COMPLACENCY IN HER CONVERSATION WITH MISSUS SHAW'S MAID SKILFULLY ELICITING MEANWHILE ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF STATE AND CONSEQUENCE CONNECTED WITH THE HARLEY STREET ESTABLISHMENT
WHAT ARE THEY' BEGAN MISTER HALE BUT MARGARET TOUCHING HIS ARM SHOWED HIM HER WATCH IT IS NEARLY SEVEN SHE SAID THE EVENINGS ARE GETTING LONGER NOW COME PAPA SHE DID NOT BREATHE FREELY
AND WHICH HE WAS ENJOYING IN A DELIBERATE MANNER IT WAS LIKE THE STORY OF THE EASTERN KING WHO DIPPED HIS HEAD INTO A BASIN OF WATER AT THE MAGICIAN'S COMMAND AND ERE HE INSTANTLY TOOK IT OUT WENT THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME MARGARET FELT STUNNED
OF THOSE SHE HAD LIVED WITH SO LONG OPPRESSED HER NOW WITH A SAD REGRET FOR THE TIMES THAT WERE NO MORE IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHAT THOSE TIMES HAD BEEN THEY WERE GONE NEVER TO RETURN MARGARET'S HEART FELT MORE HEAVY
THEN SAID I THERE'S AS GOOD A MAN GONE AS EVER LIVED ON THIS EARTH LET WHO WILL BE T OTHER AND I CAME TO SEE YO AND TELL YO HOW GRIEVED I WERE
THOUGH A TINGE OF SADNESS MIXED ITSELF WITH HER PLEASURE WHEN SCHOOL WAS OVER FOR THE DAY IT WAS YET EARLY IN THE SUMMER AFTERNOON
AND MISSUS BOYCE ALSO THEN STOLE AWAY HOME AND THE SQUIRE WENT OFF WITH SOME LITTLE PARADE SUGGESTING TO THE YOUNG MEN THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE NO NOISE IN THE HOUSE AS THEY RETURNED
MOURNFULLY AS THOUGH GRIEVING AT THE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CURRYING FAVOUR WITH LILY BY THRASHING HER LATE LOVER I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW MUCH ABOUT GIRLS SAID LORD DE GUEST BUT I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD BE SO
YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL IN WRAPPING YOURSELF AS YOU GO DOWNSTAIRS SAID BELL WHO STOOD BY THE TRAY ON WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT UP THE TOAST AND TEA THE COLD IS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL AWFUL I SHOULD CALL IT JOLLY SAID LILY IF I COULD GET UP AND GO OUT
NOW LOOK AT ME MISTER EAMES MISTER CRADELL HERE'S YOUR VERY GOOD HEALTH AND MAY ALL UNKINDNESS BE DROWNED IN THE FLOWING BOWL LOOK AT ME MISTER EAMES I'VE NEVER RISEN IN THE WORLD I'VE NEVER DONE ANY GOOD IN THE WORLD AND NEVER SHALL
HE HAS MADE THAT LADY HIS WIFE I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS THEM AND I PRAY THAT THEY MAY BE HAPPY AS SHE SPOKE THESE WORDS THERE WAS AN UNWONTED SOLEMNITY IN HER TONE WHICH STARTLED MISSUS DALE AND BELL
WHEN WE DO MEET LET US BE GLAD TO SEE EACH OTHER NO OTHER FRIEND SHALL EVER BE DEARER TO ME THAN YOU ARE YOU ARE SO TRUE AND HONEST WHEN YOU MARRY I WILL TELL YOUR WIFE WHAT AN INFINITE BLESSING GOD HAS GIVEN HER
THERE SHOULD BE SUCH PUNISHMENT BECAUSE OF THE INSINCERITY OF THAT MAN WHEN HE HAD THUS STOOD UPON THE BRIDGE FOR SOME QUARTER OF AN HOUR HE TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND WITH DEEP ROUGH GASHES IN THE WOOD CUT OUT LILY'S NAME FROM THE RAIL
AS FOR DOING ANY REAL HARM HIS PRINCIPLES AS HE ASSURED HIS FRIEND WERE TOO HIGH MISSUS LUPEX WAS A WOMAN OF TALENT WHOM NO ONE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND
WOULD BE IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE SO MUCH AS THIS SHE DID NOT EXACTLY SAY TO HERSELF BUT SHE
ANSWERING HIM WITHOUT A SIGN OF FEELING IN HER FACE OR VOICE BUT SHE TOOK IN EVERY WORD THAT HE SPOKE AND DISPUTED THEIR TRUTH INWARDLY WITH ALL THE STRENGTH OF HER HEART AND MIND AND WITH THE VERY VEHEMENCE OF HER SOUL
WHEN EAMES WENT INTO THE SITTING ROOM THE COLONEL WAS THERE ALONE AND HAD TO TAKE UPON HIMSELF THE TROUBLE OF INTRODUCING HIMSELF HE DID NOT GET UP FROM HIS ARM CHAIR
THE SQUIRE'S COMING I SUPPOSE ISN'T HE SAID MISSUS HEARN AS SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE SOFA CLOSE TO MISSUS DALE YES HE'LL BE HERE BY AND BY UNLESS HE CHANGES HIS MIND YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T STAND ON CEREMONY WITH ME
GET HIS AFFAIRS ARRANGED IN THAT TIME TO BE SURE HE MUST GIVE UP
I MUST SPEAK TO HER TO MORROW HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS HE ACCEPTED HER SALUTE WITH A MOCK GRAVITY EQUAL TO HER OWN POOR LILY HOW LITTLE SHE UNDERSTOOD AS YET WHAT WAS PASSING THROUGH HIS MIND HAD SHE KNOWN HIS WISH
BUT SHE WOULD NEVER BE ASHAMED OF HERS OR OF HIM SHE HAD GIVEN HERSELF TO HIM AND NOW ALL THE WORLD MIGHT KNOW IT IF ALL THE WORLD CARED FOR SUCH KNOWLEDGE WHY SHOULD SHE BE ASHAMED OF THAT WHICH TO HER THINKING WAS SO GREAT AN HONOUR TO HER
AND THE PUFFINGS AND SWELLINGS WENT OUT OF HER MUSLIN I THINK THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD SO PRETTY
THE TRUTH WAS SHE WAS ANGRY BECAUSE MISTER BOYCE DIDN'T GO WITH HER SHE'S ALWAYS ANGRY SAID THE SQUIRE SHE HARDLY SPEAKS TO ME NOW WHEN SHE PAID HER RENT THE OTHER DAY TO JOLLIFFE SHE SAID SHE HOPED IT WOULD DO ME MUCH GOOD AS THOUGH SHE THOUGHT ME A BRUTE FOR TAKING IT
BUT NEITHER KNEW HOW TO THROW ANY TENDERNESS INTO THIS FIRST GREETING SO YOU'RE STAYING AT THE MANOR HOUSE SAID LILY YES I'M STAYING THERE YOUR UNCLE AND BELL CAME YESTERDAY AFTERNOON HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT BELL SAID MISSUS DALE
BECAUSE HE DISCOVERED BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE THAT HE WOULD NOT BE HAPPY THAT IS THAT HE AND I WOULD NOT BE HAPPY TOGETHER IF WE WERE MARRIED DON'T SCRUTINIZE MY FOOT TOO CLOSELY LILY
THE VERY REASONS WHICH SHOULD MAKE US INDUCE HER TO GO THERE IF WE CAN PERHAPS I HAD BETTER TELL YOU ALL LORD DE GUEST HAS TAKEN HIM BY THE HAND AND WISHES HIM TO MARRY HE HAS PROMISED TO SETTLE ON HIM AN INCOME WHICH WILL MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE FOR LIFE
PAWKINS THEN TOOK HIS LORDSHIP'S ORDERS ABOUT THE WINE AND RETIRED
IS IT THAT HE DOES IT SAID JOHN
AND THEN UPON HEARING THESE WORDS AMELIA THREW HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS AS THE FOLDING DOORS BETWEEN THE TWO ROOMS WERE NOT CLOSED
AND SHE HAD ANSWERED HIM BY TELLING HIM THAT SHE LOVED MISTER CROSBIE BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD BESIDES OF COURSE SHE HAD DONE SO AT THAT TIME BUT NEVERTHELESS HER MANNER OF TELLING HIM HAD SEEMED TO HIM TO BE CRUEL AND HE ALSO HAD BEEN CRUEL
WAS ALMOST TOO DEAR MISSUS ROPER'S TEA TABLE WAS NOT PLEASANT TO HIM
WITH BELL DURING THESE VISITS HE NEVER ALLUDED TO THE MATTER SHE WAS THE CHIEF SINNER IN THAT SHE HAD REFUSED TO MARRY HER COUSIN AND HAD DECLINED EVEN TO LISTEN TO RATIONAL COUNSEL UPON THE MATTER BUT THE SQUIRE FELT
HERE'S MISTER CRADELL DOES SAY SUCH QUEER THINGS QUEER THINGS SAID CRADELL NOW MISS SPRUCE I APPEAL TO YOU HAVE I SAID ANY QUEER THINGS IF YOU DID SIR I DIDN'T NOTICE THEM SAID MISS SPRUCE
PAWKINS'S PORT WINE MAY PERHAPS HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE RESOLUTION BUT I'D GO THROUGH FIRE AND WATER FOR HER MY LORD I KNEW HER YEARS BEFORE HE HAD EVER SEEN HER AND HAVE LOVED HER A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN HE WILL EVER LOVE ANY ONE
JUST LET HER HAVE HER FLING NEVER MIND ME I'LL AMUSE MYSELF WITH MISSUS LUPEX OR MISS SPRUCE BUT THERE'LL BE THE DEUCE TO PAY WITH MISSUS LUPEX SHE'S AS CROSS AS POSSIBLE ALREADY WHENEVER AMELIA SPEAKS TO ME
AND I DON'T SUPPOSE IT CAN BE VERY WRONG WHEN YOU HAVE HAD SO DEEP AN INTEREST IN A PERSON YOU CAN'T DROP HIM ALL OF A SUDDEN THEN THERE WAS AGAIN SILENCE AND AFTER A WHILE LILY TOOK UP HER NOVEL
BUT I SHALL TAKE CARE OF MYSELF THERE'S NOTHING SO SAFE AS A LITTLE NONSENSE WITH A MARRIED WOMAN OF COURSE IT MEANS NOTHING YOU KNOW BETWEEN HER AND ME I DON'T SUPPOSE IT DOES MEAN ANYTHING
THAT'S WHAT A MAN COMES TO WHEN THINGS HAVE GONE AGAINST HIM BUT I THOUGHT MEN GOT LOTS OF MONEY BY SCENE PAINTING
I THOUGHT IT WAS UNDERSTOOD YOU WERE TO PAINT INSIDE
MUCH AS OTHER DINNERS AT SUCH TIMES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HYPOCRISY MUST ALWAYS BE PRACTISED IN CLOSELY DOMESTIC CIRCLES AT MIXED DINNER PARTIES PEOPLE CAN TALK BEFORE RICHARD AND WILLIAM
WAS IT NOT SINGULAR THAT ALL THE EVIL THINGS WHICH HE IN HIS MIND HAD MEDITATED FOR THE MAN HAD FALLEN UPON HIM CROSBIE HAD LOST HIS LOVE HE HAD SO PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A VILLAIN THAT HIS NAME MIGHT NOT BE SO MUCH AS MENTIONED
IT HAD BEEN CLEAR ENOUGH TO HER THAT EAMES HAD BEEN PIQUED BY HER OVERTURES TO CRADELL AND SHE HAD THEREFORE TO PLAY OUT THAT GAME
THEY HAVE ALL THE GOVERNING IN THEIR HANDS AND GET VERY LITTLE MONEY FOR DOING IT WORSE LUCK FOR THE COUNTRY THE COUNTRY SEEMS TO DO PRETTY WELL BUT YOU'RE A RADICAL BELL MY BELIEF IS YOU WOULDN'T BE A LADY IF YOU COULD HELP IT
OH AS FOR ME I'M AN OLD WOMAN YOU KNOW SAID MISS SPRUCE WHICH WAS CERTAINLY TRUE I DON'T SEE WHAT ANY WOMAN GETS BY MARRYING CONTINUED MISSUS LUPEX BUT A MAN GAINS EVERYTHING
BUT IT'S NOT TOO LATE YET MISTER LUPEX SAID EAMES YES IT IS EAMES YES IT IS AND NOW MISTER LUPEX HAD GRASPED THE GIN BOTTLE IT'S TOO LATE NOW THE GAME'S OVER AND THE MATCH IS LOST THE TALENT IS HERE
BUT JOHNNY I ALWAYS KNEW YOU'D COME TO SOMETHING MORE THAN COMMON I ALWAYS SAID SO THERE'S NOTHING UNCOMMON ABOUT THIS EXCEPT THAT FITZ SAYS THAT OLD HUFFLE SCUFFLE MAKES HIMSELF UNCOMMON NASTY NEVER MIND WHAT FITZ SAYS IT'S ALL JEALOUSY
I THINK SHE'D PITCH INTO HIM AS YOU CALL IT HERSELF IF SHE KNEW HOW YOU COME DOWN TO GUESTWICK FOR THE CHRISTMAS AND THEN GO OVER TO ALLINGTON AND TELL THEM ALL PLAINLY WHAT YOU MEAN I COULDN'T SAY A WORD TO HER NOW SAY IT TO THE SQUIRE THEN
AND AFTER DINNER MISSUS DALE WENT THROUGH THE GARDENS UP TO THE OTHER HOUSE WITH A WRITTEN NOTE IN HER HAND IN THAT NOTE SHE HAD TOLD LADY JULIA WITH MANY PROTESTATIONS OF GRATITUDE
WISH HE LIVED IN THE COUNTRY EIGHT HUNDRED A YEAR MY DEAR SHE HAD SAID TO MISSUS DALE THAT SOUNDS NICE DOWN HERE BECAUSE WE ARE ALL SO POOR BUT I SUPPOSE EIGHT HUNDRED A YEAR ISN'T VERY MUCH UP IN LONDON
AH YES IT HAD BEEN WELL FOR HIM THAT HE HAD NOT COME OUT ON HORSEBACK THAT RIDE HOME ALONG THE HIGH ROAD AND UP TO THE MANOR HOUSE STABLES WOULD UNDER HIS PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE BEEN ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HIM
I WONDER WHETHER YOU WOULD COME AS FAR AS THAT WITH ME AS THE REQUEST WAS MADE MISSUS DALE LOOKED AT HER DAUGHTER ALMOST BESEECHINGLY DO PRAY DO SAID HE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR WALKING
I USED TO THINK SO OFTEN OF THE LETTER THAT I SHOULD GET FROM HIM ON THIS DAY WHEN HE WOULD TELL ME THAT I WAS HIS VALENTINE WELL HE'S GOT ANOTHER VALEN TINE NOW SO MUCH SHE SAID WITH ARTICULATE VOICE
AS SOON AS THEY WERE AGAIN STANDING TOGETHER NO I DARE SAY NOT SAID EAMES BUT NOT THIS YEAR I SUPPOSE INDEED I SHOULD SAY OF COURSE NOT IN THE SPRING PERHAPS SUGGESTED EAMES HE HAD AN UNCONSCIOUS DESIRE
AS IF A WOMAN CANNOT BEAR MORE THAN A MAN SHE SAID TO HERSELF AS SHE WALKED THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM ALONE
I'M SURE IF YOU AIN'T YOU'RE VERY HARD HEARTED FOR IF EVER THERE WAS A TRUE LOVER I BELIEVE YOU'VE GOT ONE OF YOUR OWN MY IF THERE'S NOT LUPEX'S STEP ON THE STAIR WHAT CAN BRING HIM HOME AT THIS HOUR IF HE'S BEEN DRINKING HE'LL COME HOME AS CROSS AS ANYTHING
AND I'VE A SNEAKING KINDNESS FOR YOU TOO MASTER JOHNNY LORD BLESS YOU I KNEW YOUR FATHER AS WELL AS I EVER KNEW ANY MAN AND TO TELL THE TRUTH I BELIEVE I HELPED TO RUIN HIM HE HELD LAND OF ME YOU KNOW
SHALL I WRITE TO OLD BUFFLE AND ASK IT AS A FAVOUR NO SAID JOHNNY I SHOULDN'T LIKE THAT BUT I'LL SEE TO MORROW AND THEN I'LL LET YOU KNOW I CAN GO DOWN BY THE MAIL TRAIN ON SATURDAY AT ANY RATE THAT WON'T BE COMFORTABLE
WHILE HER OLD BONES WERE STIFF AND SORE AND HER OLD EARS PAINED WITH THE NOISE IT COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE SUPPER AFTER THE SUPPER HOWEVER HER MAID TOOK HER ACROSS TO HER COTTAGE
MISSUS DALE GOT UP TO LEAVE HIM BUT SHE COULD NOT GO WITHOUT SAYING SOME WORD OF GRATITUDE FOR ALL THAT HE HAD ATTEMPTED TO DO FOR THEM SHE WELL KNEW WHAT HE MEANT BY THE CURING OF DIFFICULTIES HE HAD INTENDED TO SIGNIFY THAT
BUT FELT IN SOME SORT SORE AT THE IDEA THAT HE SHOULD BE SO NEAR HER AT SUCH A TIME IN SOME UNCONSCIOUS WAY SHE HAD LIKED HIM FOR COMING TO HER AND SAYING ALL THAT HE DID SAY SHE VALUED HIM MORE HIGHLY
MISSUS DALE'S LITTLE PARTY THE NEXT DAY WAS THE DAY OF THE PARTY
HOW DIFFERENT HAD IT BEEN WHEN CROSBIE HAD MADE HIS OFFER LILY FOR THE TIME HAD BEEN RAISED TO A PINNACLE A PINNACLE WHICH MIGHT BE DANGEROUS BUT WHICH WAS AT ANY RATE LOFTY WITH WHAT A PRETTY SPEECH HAD CROSBIE BEEN GREETED
RESTING WHEN HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO REST AND RUNNING WHEN IT MIGHT SUIT HIM TO RUN AND SHE IS NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF SHE WON'T CARE FOR MY BOOTS BEING DIRTY SO AT LAST HE ELECTED TO WALK
AND OF THIS MISSUS DALE SOON FELT HERSELF AWARE THE THING HAD TO BE DONE AND NO LITTLE PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE SUCH AS THIS OF MISSUS DALE'S ENFORCED PRESENCE WOULD PREVENT IT OF THIS MISSUS DALE WAS WELL AWARE
I WAS BORN SO SAID JOHNNY AND THERE'S MISS ROPER ONE NEVER OUGHT TO SPEAK FREE ABOUT A LADY BUT PERHAPS SHE'S IN LOVE TOO SPEAK FOR YOURSELF MISSUS LUPEX SAID AMELIA THERE'S NO HARM IN SAYING THAT IS THERE
SHE'S VERY OLD YOU KNOW SAID BELL I'D GIVE HER THE HOUSE FOR NOTHING IF I WERE YOU UNCLE SAID LILY NO MY DEAR IF YOU WERE ME YOU WOULD NOT I SHOULD BE VERY WRONG TO DO SO
MEDITATING A MARIAGE DE CONVENANCE TO OBLIGE AN UNCLE AND BY NO MEANS REQUIRED BY THE TERMS OF MY AGREEMENT TO UNDERGO A VERY RIGID AMOUNT OF DRILL YOUR POSITION IS JUST THE REVERSE
OFFERS OF HOSPITALITY HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM BY THE DOZEN LADY HARTLETOP'S DOORS IN SHROPSHIRE WERE OPEN TO HIM IF HE CHOSE TO ENTER THEM
NOR YET IF I HAD GOT NO HEAD AT ALL THAT'S WHAT COMES OF GETTING MARRIED IF YOU'LL TAKE MY ADVICE MISS ROPER YOU'LL STAY AS YOU ARE EVEN THOUGH SOMEBODY SHOULD BREAK HIS HEART ABOUT IT WOULDN'T YOU MISS SPRUCE
BUT SHE IS NOT GOING TO REMAIN SHE WILL BE SO GLAD TO SEE YOU JOHN WE ALL EXPECTED YOU TO DAY DID YOU SAID JOHNNY WHOSE HEART HAD BEEN PLUNGED INTO COLD WATER AT THE MENTION OF MISTER CROSBIE'S NAME
OH MAMMA DON'T BE A GOOSE DOCTOR CROFTS IS THERE OF COURSE HE'S BEEN NEARLY AN HOUR I WONDER HOW HE IS MANAGING FOR THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH TO SIT UPON BUT THE OLD LUMP OF A CARPET THE ROOM IS STREWED ABOUT WITH CROCKERY AND BELL IS SUCH A FIGURE
AS HE REPEATED THE WORDS OVER AND OVER AGAIN THERE WAS AN EAGERNESS IN HIS VOICE THAT FILLED MISSUS DALE'S HEART WITH TENDERNESS TOWARDS HIM THE TRUTH IS SAID MISSUS DALE SHE COULD NOT GO THERE TO MEET JOHN EAMES
SHOULD HE GET UP BOLDLY AND ASK LILY TO PUT ON HER BONNET AND COME OUT INTO THE GARDEN AS THE THOUGHT STRUCK HIM HE ROSE AND GRASPED AT HIS HAT I AM GOING TO WALK BACK TO GUESTWICK SAID HE IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME SO FAR TO SEE US
THEN THERE'S BEEN SOME EXCUSE FOR MY HOLDING MY TONGUE SAID THE EARL BY THE BY DALE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT FELLOW CROSBIE EAMES EARS WERE INSTANTLY ON THE ALERT AND THE SPIRIT OF DULLNESS VANISHED FROM HIM THINK OF HIM SAID THE COLONEL
I KNEW YOUR FATHER AT GUESTWICK A GREAT MANY YEARS AGO THEN HE TURNED HIS FACE BACK TOWARDS THE FIRE AND SIGHED IT'S GOT VERY COLD THIS AFTERNOON SAID JOHNNY TRYING TO MAKE CONVERSATION IT'S ALWAYS COLD IN LONDON SAID THE COLONEL
HE THAT WAS WORRIED BY THE BULL
AND ACROSS PICCADILLY TO JERMYN STREET JOHN EAMES ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS ODD THAT HE SHOULD HAVE AN EARL LEANING ON HIS ARM AS HE PASSED ALONG THROUGH THE STREETS AT HOME IN HIS OWN LIFE HIS DAILY COMPANIONS WERE CRADELL
IN THE FIRST MONTH OR TWO THEY WERE TO LIVE IN LODGINGS AND THEIR GOODS WERE TO BE STORED IN SOME FRIENDLY WAREHOUSE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD IT NOT BE WELL
THERE WAS A SMILE UPON LILY'S FACE AS SHE LIFTED UP HER FINGER AS IF IN CAUTION AND NO ONE LOOKING AT HER WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED THAT SHE WAS HERSELF IN TROUBLE MAMMA SHE SAID POINTING TO THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND SPEAKING ALMOST IN A WHISPER
AND WAS TOO ANXIOUS TO DO THE MECHANICAL PART OF THE WORK IN A MANNER THAT SHOULD BE SATISFACTORY TO HER PARTNER OH THANK YOU IT'S VERY NICE I SHALL BE ABLE TO GO ON AGAIN DIRECTLY
NOT HANDSOME FOR HER NOSE WAS THICK AND THE LOWER PART OF HER FACE WAS HEAVY BUT YET NOT WITHOUT SOME FEMININE ATTRACTIONS HER EYES WERE BRIGHT BUT THEN ALSO THEY WERE MISCHIEVOUS SHE COULD TALK FLUENTLY ENOUGH BUT THEN ALSO SHE COULD SCOLD
I DOUBT THE ELIGIBILITY OF THE PROFFERED ENTERTAINMENT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION JOHN EAMES SEEMED TO BE OF THIS OPINION FOR HE DID NOT AT ONCE ACCEPT THE INVITATION WILL YOU NOT OBLIGE ME SO FAR AS THAT
YOU ARE STRONGER THAN I AM HE SAID NOT STRONGER BUT MORE CERTAIN MAKE YOURSELF AS SURE AS I AM AND YOU TOO WILL BE STRONG IS IT NOT SO MAMMA
OH AT ALL MANNER OF HOURS ANY TIME BEFORE TWELVE THEY WILL BE FASHIONABLE AND WILL BE MARRIED LATE YOU DON'T THINK SHE'S MISSUS CROSBIE YET THEN LADY ALEXANDRINA CROSBIE SAID BELL SHUDDERING YES
AND ABOVE ALL THINGS NEVER THINK THAT YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH YOURSELF A MAN SHOULD NEVER THINK THAT MY BELIEF IS THAT IN LIFE PEOPLE WILL TAKE YOU VERY MUCH AT YOUR OWN RECKONING IF YOU ARE MADE OF DIRT LIKE THAT FELLOW CROSBIE
BUT THIS HE DECLINED AND TAKING HIMSELF AWAY HID HIMSELF ABOUT THE PLACE FOR THE NEXT HOUR AND A HALF DURING THIS TIME HE CONSIDERED MUCH WHETHER IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO RIDE OR WALK IF SHE SHOULD GIVE HIM ANY HOPE
HE HAD NOT LEARNED THE ART OF ASSUMING HIMSELF TO BE OF IMPORTANCE IN WHATEVER PLACE HE MIGHT FIND HIMSELF IT WAS THIS ART WHICH
PERHAPS IT'S BEST AS IT IS SAID THE EARL I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY GOOD WOULD BE GOT BY KNOCKING HIM OVER THE HEAD AND IF WE ARE TO BE CHRISTIANS I SUPPOSE WE OUGHT TO BE CHRISTIANS WHAT SORT OF A CHRISTIAN HAS HE BEEN
YOU'LL BEWARE OF MARRYING TOO SOON IN LIFE I THINK A MAN SHOULD MARRY EARLY IF HE MARRIES WELL SAID EAMES DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME CONTINUED LUPEX IT ISN'T ABOUT MISSUS L I'M SPEAKING I'VE ALWAYS REGARDED MY WIFE AS A VERY FASCINATING WOMAN
THEN CRADELL BY DEGREES BECAME HAPPY AND CORDIAL AND DURING THE WHOLE WALK FLATTERED EAMES WITH ALL THE FLATTERY OF WHICH HE WAS MASTER AND JOHNNY THOUGH HE DID PROFESS HIMSELF TO BE AVERSE TO ALL THAT KIND OF THING WAS NEVERTHELESS OPEN TO FLATTERY
AND AS HE REPEATED THE WORDS FOR THE THIRD TIME HIS LIPS WERE ALREADY FIXED TO THE RIM OF HIS TUMBLER AT THIS MOMENT THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM WAS OPENED AND MISSUS LUPEX PUT IN HER HEAD LUPEX SHE SAID WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AND HIS UNCHECKED ARM STOLE ROUND HER WAIST IT IS THE MEANING OF THE MOONLIGHT
BUT HE'S IN THERE CERTAINLY UNLESS HE HAS GONE OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW OR UP THE CHIMNEY WHAT MADE YOU LEAVE THEM HE MET ME HERE IN THE PASSAGE AND SPOKE TO ME EVER SO SERIOUSLY COME IN I SAID AND SEE BELL PACKING THE POKERS AND TONGS
I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WILL BE BETTER THAT I SHOULD NO MAMMA NO WHAT GOOD CAN IT DO IT CAN DO NO GOOD I LIKE HIM AS WELL AS I CAN LIKE ANY ONE I LOVE HIM DEARLY BUT IT CAN DO NO GOOD LET HIM COME IN HERE AND BE VERY KIND TO HIM
I WILL GO IN HE SAID BUT DON'T COME WITH ME HE WAS EVER SO SERIOUS AND I'M SURE HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF IT ALL THE WAY ALONG AND WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE SERIOUS OH NO OF COURSE HE OUGHT TO BE SERIOUS BUT ARE YOU NOT GLAD MAMMA
WITH SUCH EARNEST PROTESTATIONS OF FRIENDSHIP TO REMAIN AND WAS SO WEAKLY FEARFUL OF BEING CHARGED WITH GIVING HIMSELF AIRS THAT HE DID AS HE WAS DESIRED AND HERE MISTER EAMES IS TO YOUR VERY GOOD HEALTH SAID LUPEX
AND SOON PEOPLE CAME FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO LOOK AT THE QUEER HOUSE AND THEY USUALLY WENT AWAY LAUGHING THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT MIND THIS AT ALL SHE WAS TOO BUSY TO BE ANGRY
WHEN THEY HAVE GROWN UP BIG AND STRONG SAID MARY ONE MORNING AS SHE WEEDED THE BED AND WHEN THEY HAVE BUDDED AND BLOSSOMED AND FADED AWAY AGAIN THEN PAPA AND MY BROTHERS WILL COME HOME AND I SHALL CALL THE COCKLE SHELLS PAPA
THE BIG WISE MAN GOT VERY RED IN THE FACE AND SCOWLED AND COUGHED AND STAMMERED BUT HE COULD NOT TELL I DO NOT KNOW HE ACKNOWLEDGED NOR DO YOU KNOW EITHER
WRITTEN ALSO VERGOOSE AND VERTIGOOSE WHO BELONGED TO A WEALTHY FAMILY HER ELDEST DAUGHTER ELIZABETH GOOSE OR VERTIGOOSE
SOME OF THE FAMOUS PEASE PORRIDGE THAT WAS MADE THERE AND FINALLY AFTER A LONG AND TIRESOME JOURNEY HE REACHED THE TOWN AND STOPPED AT ONE OF THE FIRST HOUSES HE CAME TO
AND THE PEOPLE ALL WEPT WITH GRIEF AT THIS AND SOLOMON HOWLED LOUDER THAN ANY OF THEM NOW THE FACT WAS THAT WHEN SOLOMON JUMPED INTO THE BRAMBLE BUSH HE WAS WEARING HIS SPECTACLES
I LL TELL YOU WHAT WE CAN DO REMARKED THE ASTRONOMER
ASKED THE BIG BLUFF SQUIRE FORGETTING HIS POETRY
YOU ARE SIXTEEN VERY NAUGHTY CHILDREN EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN AND FOR PUNISHMENT YOU MUST EAT YOUR BROTH WITHOUT ANY BREAD AND AFTERWARDS EACH ONE SHALL HAVE A SOUND WHIPPING AND BE SENT TO BED THEN ALL THE CHILDREN BEGAN TO CRY AT ONCE
AND HELD FAST BY THE BRAMBLES WHICH SCRATCHED AND PRICKED HIM ON EVERY SIDE SOLOMON ARE YOU HURT THEY CRIED I SHOULD SAY I AM HURT REPLIED SOLOMON WITH A GROAN
A FLOWER GARDEN REPEATED HER MOTHER IN SURPRISE WHY DO YOU WISH A FLOWER GARDEN MARY I WANT TO PLANT IN IT THE COCKLE SHELLS AND THE COWSLIPS AND THE DINGLE BELLS SHE ANSWERED AND HER MOTHER
REPLIED TO HIM LIKEWISE IN RHYME SAYING I THANK YOU SQUIRE THAT YOU ENQUIRE HOW WELL THE FLOWERS ARE GROWING THE DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ARE BLOWING
AND THEN SHE PATTED THE CHILD UPON HER HEAD AND WALKED AWAY DOWN THE VALLEY BO PEEP WAS MUCH GRIEVED OVER THE LOSS THAT HAD BEFALLEN HER DEAR SHEEP AND SO DRIVING THEM BEFORE HER SHE WANDERED AROUND TO SEE IF BY ANY CHANCE SHE COULD FIND THE LOST TAILS
AND THERE WAS SUCH AN UPROAR THAT THEIR GRANDMOTHER HAD TO PUT COTTON IN HER EARS THAT SHE MIGHT NOT LOSE HER HEARING BUT SHE KEPT HER PROMISE AND MADE THEM EAT THEIR BROTH WITHOUT ANY BREAD FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO BREAD TO GIVE THEM THEN SHE STOOD THEM IN A ROW AND UNDRESSED THEM
SO YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR SHEEP DEARIE SHE SAID IN HER CRACKED VOICE YES REPLIED LITTLE BO PEEP WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSING A SOB BUT LOOK MOTHER THEY VE ALL LEFT THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM WHY SO THEY HAVE EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN
FOR I HAVE NEVER YET HAD MY ATTENTION CALLED TO THIS SUBJECT SO HE THOUGHT FOR A LONG TIME AND THEN HE SAID I MUST REALLY GIVE IT UP I CANNOT TELL FOR THE LIFE OF ME WHY A MAN HAS TWO EYES
GOOD MORNING LITTLE BO PEEP AND LOOKING UP THE GIRL SAW A WOMAN STANDING NEAR HER AND LEANING UPON A SHORT STICK SHE WAS BENT NEARLY DOUBLE BY WEIGHT OF MANY YEARS HER HAIR WAS WHITE AS SNOW AND HER EYES AS BLACK AS COALS
WILL YOU HAVE IT HOT OR COLD SIR OH COLD BY ALL MEANS REPLIED THE MAN FOR I DETEST ANYTHING HOT TO EAT SHE SOON BROUGHT HIM A BOWL OF COLD PEASE PORRIDGE
THE OLD WOMAN CHUCKLED SOFTLY AS IF THE ANSWER AMUSED HER AND REPLIED NO ONE KNOWS ALL ABOUT ANYTHING MY DEAR BUT I KNOW ALL ABOUT MY SHEEP PROTESTED LITTLE BO PEEP DO YOU INDEED
PRINTED BY T FLEET AT HIS PRINTING HOUSE IN PUDDING LANE SEVENTEEN NINETEEN PRICE TWO COPPERS MISTER WM A WHEELER THE EDITOR OF HURD AND HOUGHTON'S ELABORATE EDITION OF MOTHER GOOSE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY REITERATED THIS ASSERTION
BUT CONTINUED TO SING HER RHYMES AS BEFORE FOR HOWEVER MUCH GROWN PEOPLE MIGHT LAUGH AT HER THE CHILDREN SEEMED TO ENJOY THEM VERY MUCH AND NOT ONE OF THEM WAS TOO PEEVISH TO BE QUIETED AND SOOTHED BY HER VERSES
THE CHILDREN LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER IN SURPRISE FOR THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THE BREAD AND THEN ONE OF THEM CONFESSED AND TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY OF HOW THEY HAD FRIGHTENED THE BAKER MAN FOR SAYING HE WOULD SEND THEM TO THE POOR HOUSE
AND SO HE WENT SOFTLY UP TO THE PIG STY AND REACHED OVER AND GRABBED THE LITTLE PIG BY THE EARS THE PIG SQUEALED OF COURSE BUT THE FARMER WAS MAKING SO MUCH NOISE HIMSELF THAT HE DID NOT HEAR IT
TO HIS GRAY MARE AND RODE AWAY THE VERY NEXT DAY TO MARY'S GREAT SURPRISE AND GRIEF SHE FOUND THE LEAVES OF THE DINGLE BELLS CURLING AND BEGINNING TO WITHER OH MAMMA SHE CALLED COME QUICK
SO HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND BUCKLED A STRAP AROUND HIS WAIST AND WENT DOWN TO THE VILLAGE TO SEE IF HE COULD FIND OUT WHO HAD STOLEN HIS PIG UP AND DOWN THE STREET HE WENT AND IN AND OUT THE LANES
YOU RE IN NORWICH THAT IS TRUE ANSWERED THE MAN WHO WAS QUITE BEWILDERED BY THIS IDEA AND OF COURSE YOU MUST BE CALLED SOMETHING CONTINUED THE MAGISTRATE WELL THEN SAID THE PRISONER
AND BEING THE ONLY CHILD UPON THE FARM SHE WAS ALLOWED TO ROAM ABOUT THE MEADOWS AND WOODS AS SHE PLEASED ON THE BRIGHT SUMMER MORNINGS DOROTHY'S MOTHER WOULD TIE A SUN BONNET UNDER THE GIRL'S CHIN
BUT AS IT WAS NOW TIME FOR LUNCHEON SHE OPENED HER LITTLE BASKET AND ATE OF THE BREAD AND CHEESE AND COOKIES SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER AFTER SHE HAD FINISHED HER MEAL AND TAKEN A DRINK OF COOL WATER FROM A SPRING NEAR BY
THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS DISCOVERY AND REACHING UP HER CROOK SHE KNOCKED THE ROW OF PRETTY WHITE TAILS OFF THE TREE AND GATHERED THEM UP IN HER FROCK BUT HOW TO FASTEN THEM ONTO HER SHEEP AGAIN WAS THE QUESTION
AND I THINK BECAUSE THE FLOWERS ARE STRONG AND HEARTY THAT YOU MAY KNOW YOUR FATHER AND BROTHERS ARE THE SAME
JUST AS THE GRASSES BEGAN TO GROW GREEN UPON THE CLIFF AND THE TREES WERE DRESSING THEIR STIFF BARREN BRANCHES IN ROBES OF DELICATE FOLIAGE THE FATHER AND BROTHERS BADE GOOD BYE TO MARY AND HER MOTHER FOR THEY WERE STARTING UPON A VOYAGE TO THE BLACK SEA
HIS FATHER THOUGHT HE HAD A WOND'ROUS WISE LOOK WHEN HE WAS BORN AND SO HE NAMED HIM SOLOMON THINKING THAT IF INDEED HE TURNED OUT TO BE WISE THE NAME WOULD FIT HIM NICELY WHEREAS SHOULD HE BE MISTAKEN AND THE BOY GROW UP STUPID
ALTHOUGH PERRAULT'S TALES DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE WE NOW KNOW UNDER THIS TITLE THEY COMPRISED THE SLEEPING BEAUTY THE FAIRY LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD BLUE BEARD PUSS IN BOOTS
AND SANTA CLAUS WHEN HE SEES ME ALWAYS GIVES ME A NOD AND A SMILE AND THEN I LOOK AFTER HIM AND HIS BIG LOAD OF TOYS WHICH HE IS CARRYING TO THE CHILDREN UNTIL HE HAS GALLOPED AWAY OUT OF SIGHT I LIKE TO SEE THE TOYS FOR THEY ARE SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY
BUT IT WAS NOW THE BIG MAN'S TURN TO TRY SOLOMON SO HE SAID FINGERS FIVE ARE ON MY HAND ALL OF THEM UPRIGHT DO STAND
AFTER I GOT HOME REPLIED THE RABBIT THE COLLAR DISAPPEARED FROM AROUND MY NECK AND I KNEW SANTA HAD CALLED IT BACK TO HIMSELF AGAIN HE DID NOT GIVE IT TO ME YOU SEE HE MERELY LET ME TAKE IT ON MY JOURNEY TO PROTECT ME
THE MAGISTRATE LOOKED AT HIM A MOMENT IN SURPRISE AND THEN HE SAID THIS PERSON IS EVIDENTLY CRAZY SO TAKE HIM TO THE LUNATIC ASYLUM AND KEEP HIM THERE
THE PIG WAS EAT AND TOM WAS BEAT AND TOM RAN CRYING DOWN THE STREET
AND EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE APPEALS MORE TO THE CHILDISH MIND THAN DOES MOTHER GOOSE HERSELF MANY OF THESE NURSERY RHYMES ARE COMPLETE TALES IN THEMSELVES TELLING THEIR STORY TERSELY BUT COMPLETELY THERE ARE OTHERS WHICH ARE BUT BARE SUGGESTIONS
BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THE WINTER IN WINTER WE RABBITS SAID BUNNY SO SHY KEEP WATCH TO SEE SANTA GO GALLOPING BY AND DO YOU EVER SEE HIM ASKED THE GIRL EAGERLY OH YES EVERY WINTER
I MUST HUNT UNTIL I FIND THOSE THAT BELONG TO MY SHEEP MY DEAR SAID THE OLD WOMAN I HAVE BEEN DECEIVING YOU YOU SAID YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT YOUR SHEEP AND I WANTED TO TEACH YOU A LESSON FOR HOWEVER WISE WE MAY BE
MARY'S MOTHER KNEW THAT THE HARSH WINDS HAD KILLED THE FLOWERS BEFORE THEIR TIME BUT SHE DID NOT LIKE TO DISAPPOINT HER DARLING SO SHE ONLY SAID WITH A SIGH I HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT MARY
SQUIRE TOOK HER TOWARD THE LITTLE BROOK THAT WANDERED THROUGH THE MEADOWS FLOWING OVER THE PEBBLES WITH A SOFT GURGLING SOUND THAT WAS VERY NEARLY AS SWEET AS MUSIC AND WHEN THEY REACHED IT THE BIG SQUIRE SAID IF YOU WILL LOOK BESIDE THE BROOK
CALLED OUT THE DOCTOR I M IN THE ELDERBERRY BUSH AND I VE SCRATCHED MY EYES IN AGAIN ANSWERED SOLOMON WHEN THE PEOPLE HEARD THIS THEY MARVELLED GREATLY
THE DINGLE BELL I NOW MUST TELL I VE NAMED FOR BROTHER HOBART AND WHEN THE FLOWERS HAVE LIVED THEIR LIVES IN SUNSHINE AND IN RAIN AND THEN DO FADE WHY PAPA SAID
BUT AFTER AWHILE THE TINY MAID REALIZED THAT ALL HER TEARS WOULD NOT BRING BACK THE TAILS TO HER LAMBKINS SO SHE PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND DRIED HER EYES AND AROSE FROM THE GROUND JUST AS THE OLD WOMAN HOBBLED UP TO HER
AND THEN SHE BEGAN TO LAUGH AS IF SOMETHING PLEASED HER WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HAS BECOME OF THEIR TAILS ASKED THE GIRL OH SOME ONE HAS PROBABLY CUT THEM OFF THEY MAKE NICE TIPPETS IN WINTER TIME YOU KNOW
BUT THEN YOU SEE I HAVE BEEN MAKING TOYS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND I MAKE SO MANY IT IS NO WONDER I AM SKILLFUL AND NOW IF YOU ARE READY TO GO HOME I LL HITCH UP THE REINDEER AND TAKE YOU BACK AGAIN
AND A WRITER IN THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT OF JUNE SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR SAYS FLEET'S BOOK WAS PARTLY A REPRINT OF AN ENGLISH COLLECTION OF SONGS BARCLAY'S AND THE NEW TITLE WAS DOUBTLESS A COMPLIMENT BY THE PRINTER TO HIS MOTHER IN LAW GOOSE FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS
ANSWERED HIS FATHER WELL CONTINUED SOLOMON THE DOG HAS TWO OTHER LEGS BESIDES AND TWO AND FOUR ARE SIX THEREFORE THE DOG HAS SIX LEGS
AT ONE TIME MISTRESS GOOCH WAS NURSING A CHILD OF MISTER RONALD BARCLAY A PHYSICIAN RESIDING IN THE TOWN AND HE NOTICED THE RHYMES SHE SANG AND BECAME INTERESTED IN THEM IN TIME HE WROTE THEM ALL DOWN AND MADE A BOOK OF THEM
HOW DINGLE BELLS AND COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ARE GROWING OH SQUIRE SOBBED MARY I AM IN GREAT TROUBLE EACH DINGLE BELL I LOVED SO WELL BEFORE MY EYES IS DYING
DECIDED THAT SHE WAS FULLY ABLE TO MANAGE THE FLOCKS HERSELF SHE WAS A LITTLE MITE OF A CHILD WITH FLOWING NUT BROWN LOCKS AND BIG GRAY EYES THAT CHARMED ALL WHO GAZED INTO THEIR INNOCENT DEPTHS SHE WORE A LIGHT GRAY FROCK
LEAVING THE IMAGINATION TO WEAVE IN THE DETAILS OF THE STORY PERHAPS THEREIN MAY LIE PART OF THEIR CHARM BUT HOWEVER THAT MAY BE I HAVE THOUGHT THE CHILDREN MIGHT LIKE THE STORIES TOLD AT GREATER LENGTH THAT THEY MAY DWELL THE LONGER UPON THEIR FAVORITE HEROES AND HEROINES
SO THE BALLOON WAS BROUGHT AND INFLATED AND THE MAN GOT INTO THE BASKET AND GAVE THE WORD TO LET GO AND THEN THE BALLOON MOUNTED UP INTO THE SKY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MOON THE GOOD PEOPLE OF NORWICH STOOD ON THE EARTH
IS OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS BOSTON'S THERE LIVED IN A TOWN IN SUSSEX ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN O FOUR AN OLD WOMAN NAMED MARTHA GOOCH SHE WAS A CAPITAL NURSE AND IN GREAT DEMAND TO CARE FOR NEWLY BORN BABIES THEREFORE
AND THE FURNITURE TO SHOW A GOOD MANY SCRATCHES AND BRUISES BUT THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED TO LOOK AFTER THEM AS WELL AS SHE WAS ABLE UNTIL SARAH HER THIRD DAUGHTER ALSO DIED AND THREE MORE CHILDREN WERE SENT TO THEIR GRANDMOTHER TO BE BROUGHT UP
AND THEN SHE ROMPED AWAY TO THE FIELDS TO AMUSE HERSELF IN HER OWN WAY SHE CAME TO KNOW EVERY FLOWER THAT GREW AND TO CALL THEM BY NAME AND SHE ALWAYS STEPPED VERY CAREFULLY TO AVOID TREADING ON THEM FOR DOROTHY WAS A KIND HEARTED CHILD
AND BEGAN TO PLAY WITH ALL HIS MIGHT THE FARMER WAS IN HIS WOODSHED SAWING WOOD SO HE DID NOT HEAR THE PIPES AND THE FARMER'S WIFE WAS DEAF AND COULD NOT HEAR THEM
THEN A FLIGHT OF ARROWS CAME FROM THE BUSHES AND ALTHOUGH THEY WERE BLUNT AND COULD DO HIM NO HARM THEY RATTLED ALL OVER HIS BODY AND ONE HIT HIS NOSE AND ANOTHER HIS CHIN WHILE SEVERAL STUCK FAST IN THE LOAVES OF BREAD ALTOGETHER THE BAKER MAN WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
WELL THE MAN IN THE I MEAN THE MAN
AND THE STRANGER SAT DOWN AND WATCHED IN SILENCE THE BUSY FINGERS SEW UP THE SEAMS OF THE NEW FROCK SHE WAS MAKING BY AND BY THE WOMAN ASKED WHY DO YOU COME OUT HERE TO SEW BECAUSE I AM A SHEPHERDESS REPLIED THE GIRL
AND PUT BOTH ARMS TIGHT AROUND THE MOONBEAM AND STARTED TO SLIDE DOWN BUT HE FOUND IT RATHER SLIPPERY AND IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EFFORTS TO HOLD ON HE FOUND HIMSELF GOING
AND LITTLE BOY BLUE IN SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN CHARLES PERRAULT PUBLISHED IN FRANCE
I WANT THEM IN FRONT PERSISTED MARY FOR THE SUN SHINES STRONGER THERE VERY WELL ANSWERED HER MOTHER MAKE YOUR GARDEN AT THE FRONT IF YOU WILL
SAID THE OLD WOMAN I AM GOING OVER THE HILL TOP MYSELF AND I WILL SEND THE SHEEP BACK TO YOU SO SHE GOT UPON HER FEET AND BEGAN CLIMBING THE HILL AND THE GIRL HEARD HER SAYING AS SHE WALKED AWAY LITTLE BO PEEP HAS LOST HER SHEEP
I VERY MUCH SUSPECT THE REAL REASON THEY ARE DYING IS BECAUSE THE COLD SEA WIND CAUGHT THEM LAST NIGHT DINGLE BELLS ARE DELICATE IF YOU HAD SCATTERED THE COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ABOUT THEM THE STRONGER PLANTS WOULD HAVE PROTECTED THE WEAKER BUT YOU SEE MY GIRL
ONE A FLY IS IN A CUP HOW MANY FINGERS DO I HOLD UP FOUR REPLIED SOLOMON PROMPTLY FOR ONE OF THEM IS A THUMB
AND HE PLAYED THIS ONE TUNE AS BADLY AS HIS FATHER HIMSELF PLAYED SO THAT THE PEOPLE WERE ANNOYED WHEN THEY HEARD HIM AND OFTEN BEGGED HIM TO STOP WHEN HE CAME TO FARMER BOWSER'S HOUSE TOM STARTED UP THE PIPES
IF I M NOT THE MAN IN THE MOON I MUST BE THE MAN OUT OF THE MOON SO CALL ME THAT VERY GOOD REPLIED THE JUDGE NOW THEN WHERE DID YOU COME FROM THE MOON OH YOU DID EH
SO FOR SEVERAL DAYS I WATCHED HIM MAKING ALL KINDS OF TOYS AND I WONDERED TO SEE HOW QUICKLY HE MADE THEM AND HOW MANY NEW THINGS HE INVENTED I ALMOST WISH I WAS A CHILD I SAID TO HIM ONE DAY FOR THEN I TOO COULD HAVE PLAYTHINGS
ONLY A GREEN VALLEY AND ANOTHER HILL BEYOND NOW REALLY ALARMED FOR THE SAFETY OF HER CHARGE BO PEEP HURRIED INTO THE VALLEY AND UP THE FARTHER HILL SIDE PANTING AND TIRED SHE REACHED THE SUMMIT AND PAUSING BREATHLESSLY
THE WEATHER NOW BEGAN TO CHANGE AND THE COLD SEA WINDS BLEW EACH NIGHT OVER MARY'S GARDEN SHE DID NOT KNOW THIS FOR SHE WAS ALWAYS LYING SNUGLY TUCKED UP IN HER BED
YOU ARE SURELY MISTAKEN SIR SAID SOLOMON WITH THE GRAVITY THAT COMES FROM GREAT WISDOM THESE ARE OUR DOG'S FORE LEGS ARE THEY NOT POINTING TO THE FRONT LEGS OF THE DOG YES
AND THEN HE CONTINUED T IS APTLY SAID BUT PRITHEE MAID WHY THUS YOUR GARDEN FILL WHEN EV'RY FIELD THE SAME FLOWERS YIELD TO PLUCK THEM AS YOU WILL THAT IS A LONG STORY SQUIRE
AND YOU SHALL PLANT YOUR FLOWERS AND CARE FOR THEM YOURSELF I THINK I D RATHER HAVE THE FLOWERS AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE SAID MARY BUT WHY ENQUIRED HER MOTHER THEY WILL BE BETTER SHELTERED AT THE SIDE
ASKED THE SQUIRE IN HIS KIND BLUFF VOICE AND MARY ANSWERED ALTHOUGH THE FLOWERS I MUCH ADMIRE YOU KNOW PAPA DID SAY HE WON'T BE HOME AGAIN SQUIRE TILL ALL HAVE PASSED AWAY
OF COURSE SOLOMON WORE GLASSES UPON HIS EYES ALL WISE PEOPLE WEAR THEM AND HIS FACE WAS EVER GRAVE AND SOLEMN WHILE HE WALKED SLOWLY AND STIFFLY SO THAT PEOPLE MIGHT KNOW HE WAS THE CELEBRATED WISE MAN
AFTER THIS SAID SANTA CLAUS I CAN MAKE RABBITS WITHOUT HAVING YOU FOR A PATTERN BUT IF YOU LIKE YOU MAY STAY A FEW DAYS LONGER IN MY CASTLE AND AMUSE YOURSELF I THANKED HIM AND DECIDED TO STAY
THE MAN IN THE MOON CALLED TO HIM AND SAID HOW IS EVERYTHING DOWN ON THE EARTH EVERYTHING IS LOVELY REPLIED THE ALDERMAN AND I WOULD N'T LEAVE IT IF I WAS NOT OBLIGED TO
WHEN TOM SHOWED BY HIS ACTIONS HIS INTENTION OF BEING HONEST HE SOON GOT A JOB OF WORK TO DO AND BEFORE LONG HE WAS ABLE TO EARN A LIVING MORE EASILY AND A GREAT DEAL MORE HONESTLY
THE PIPER AND HIS SON HAD A FINE DINNER THAT DAY AND SO GREAT WAS THEIR HUNGER THAT THE LITTLE PIG WAS ALL EATEN UP AT ONE MEAL THEN BARNEY LAY DOWN TO SLEEP AND TOM SAT ON A BENCH OUTSIDE THE DOOR
AND NOW SHE PERMITTED MARY TO MAKE HER OWN GARDEN AND PLANT IT AS SHE WOULD SO MARY MADE A LONG NARROW BED AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND THEN SHE PREPARED TO PLANT HER FLOWERS IF YOU SCATTER THE SEEDS SAID HER MOTHER
AND AS THE BIG MAN DID NOT DARE TO FOLLOW SOLOMON INTO THE BRAMBLE BUSH HE TURNED AWAY AND RAN HOME TO CUMBERLAND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR TOWN WERE HORRIFIED WHEN THEY CAME UP AND FOUND THEIR WISE MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRAMBLE BUSH
YOU SEE WE HAVE ONLY OUR EYES AND OUR EARS AND OUR LEGS TO DEFEND OURSELVES WITH WE CANNOT FIGHT BUT WE CAN ALWAYS RUN AWAY AND THAT IS A MUCH BETTER WAY TO SAVE OUR LIVES THAN BY FIGHTING WHERE IS YOUR HOME BUNNY ENQUIRED THE GIRL
AND LET THOSE STUCK UP TORONTO BOYS GRIN LIKE CHESSY CATS BUT WHEN FELICITY LAUGHED AT HIM THE IRON ENTERED INTO PETER'S SOUL IF THE STORY GIRL LAUGHED AT PETER THE MILLS OF THE GODS GROUND OUT HIS REVENGE FOR HIM IN MID AFTERNOON
BUT TO FELIX EVERYTHING SUDDENLY BECAME FLAT STALE AND UNPROFITABLE BECAUSE PETER CONTINUED TO HOLD THE CHAMPIONSHIP OF BITTER APPLES IT HAUNTED HIS WAKING HOURS AND OBSESSED HIS NIGHTS I HEARD HIM TALKING IN HIS SLEEP ABOUT IT
THE NEXT DAY HE COMPLAINED OF HEADACHE AND SORE THROAT AND SEEMED TO PREFER LYING ON AUNT OLIVIA'S KITCHEN SOFA TO DOING ANY WORK AS IT WAS NOT IN PETER TO BE A MALINGERER HE WAS LEFT IN PEACE WHILE WE PICKED APPLES
SHE SAID I HEARD UNCLE EDWARD TELLING EVER SO MANY STORIES ABOUT HIM HE WAS CALLED TO THIS CONGREGATION AND HE LABOURED HERE LONG AND FAITHFULLY AND WAS MUCH BELOVED THOUGH HE WAS VERY ECCENTRIC WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ASKED PETER HUSH
SARA MIGHT BETTER HAVE STAYED HOME SHE WAS OF NO USE AND COULD ONLY ADD TO THE GENERAL CONFUSION WANDERING AIMLESSLY ABOUT CRYING AND ASKING IF DAN WAS GOING TO DIE
THE POOR MAN MEANT IT AS A COMPLIMENT BUT FELICITY WHO KNEW UNCLE BLAIR WAS AN ARTIST AND HAD A POOR OPINION OF SUCH FRY LOOKED INDIGNANT AND RETORTED INDEED SHE WASN'T
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR A HORRIBLE FEAR WHICH FLASHED INTO HER MIND THAT POSSIBLY SAWDUST PUDDINGS WERE NOT HEALTHY FOR PEOPLE TO EAT
THEN WE FOREGATHERED AROUND A TINY WOOD SPRING COLD AND PELLUCID UNDER ITS YOUNG MAPLES AND ATE THE JELLY COOKIES AND THE STORY GIRL TOLD US A TALE OF A HAUNTED SPRING IN A MOUNTAIN GLEN WHERE A FAIR WHITE LADY DWELT
IF I PUT IT OFF ANY LONGER IT WILL BE TOO LATE I'M GROWING SO FAST AUNT OLIVIA SAYS I'LL HAVE TO WEAR ANKLE SKIRTS NEXT SUMMER IF I BEGIN TO LOOK GROWN UP HE'LL GET FRIGHTENED OF ME AND THEN I'LL NEVER FIND OUT THE GOLDEN MILESTONE MYSTERY
DEMANDED THE STORY GIRL AGGRIEVED I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING RETORTED AUNT JANET
BUT IT WAS OVER TWO HOURS SINCE WE HAD EATEN THE COOKIES AND FELICITY SUGGESTED THAT A SAUCERFUL APIECE
PLEADED CECILY TURNING TO THE STORY GIRL WHO WAS SITTING ON A BIN SWINGING HER SHAPELY BARE FEET TO AND FRO IT DOESN'T DO TO MEDDLE IN AN AFFAIR OF THIS KIND BETWEEN BOYS SAID THE STORY GIRL SAGELY
TALL AND STRAIGHT WAS HE AS A YOUNG PINE AND HIS LONG HAIR WAS THE COLOUR OF RIPE WHEAT IN THE SUN AND HIS BLUE EYES WERE LIKE THE NORTHLAND HEAVENS ON A STARRY NIGHT IN ODIN'S BAND WAS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN NAMED ALIN
SOMEBODY KILLED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING LIKE THAT EVER HAPPENED IN OUR FAMILY THE KINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RESPECTABLE PERHAPS IT IS EMILY
ONE BITTER DAY WHEN THEY SEEK IT
UNCLE ROGER SAYS PETER'S FATHER WASN'T EXACTLY LAZY SAID THE STORY GIRL THE TROUBLE WAS THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER THINGS HE LIKED BETTER THAN WORK
THOU MAYEST RETURN TO EARTH IF THOU FEAREST TO ESSAY THE FLOOD SAID THE WARDER NAY SAID VING WILDLY EARTHLY LIFE WITHOUT ALIN IS MORE DREADFUL THAN THE DEATH WHICH AWAITS ME IN YON DARK RIVER
SAID FELIX OMINOUSLY THEY TELL ME THAT YOU'VE BEEN PRAYING RIGHT ALONG THAT I COULDN'T EAT A BITTER APPLE NOW I TELL YOU
AND SO TOOK UP LESS ROOM DURING THE DISCUSSION WE CAME OUT TO THE FENCE OF THE HILL PASTURE WHERE GREW THE BAD BERRY BUSHES JUST WHAT THESE BAD BERRIES WERE I CANNOT TELL WE NEVER KNEW THEIR REAL NAME
I THINK THERE IS SUCH A PLACE IN SPITE OF UNCLE EDWARD SAID THE STORY GIRL DREAMILY AND I THINK THERE IS A WAY OF GETTING THERE TOO IF WE COULD ONLY FIND IT
HER VERY VOICE TAKING ON A CLEAR REMOTE STARRY SOUND AS SHE TALKED OF THEM WHEN SHE CEASED WE CAME BACK TO EARTH FEELING AS IF WE HAD BEEN MILLIONS OF MILES AWAY IN THE BLUE ETHER
ODIN WAS THE GREAT GOD OF THE NORTHLAND YOU KNOW AND WHEREVER HE WENT AMONG MEN HE TAUGHT THEM LOVE AND BROTHERHOOD AND SKILFUL ARTS
SHE SAYS NONE OF US MUST GO NEAR THE PLACE TILL WE KNOW WHETHER IT IS THE MEASLES OR NOT I'VE THOUGHT OF A GREAT PENANCE SAID CECILY EAGERLY DON'T GO TO THE MISSIONARY MEETING TO NIGHT THE STORY GIRL LOOKED PITEOUS
AS THE STORY GIRL PROUDLY INFORMED US WHEN WE CAME TO THE DINNER TABLE ALL ON HER OWN HOOK SHE WAS VERY PROUD OF IT AND CERTAINLY AS FAR AS APPEARANCE WENT IT JUSTIFIED HER TRIUMPH THE SLICES WERE SMOOTH AND GOLDEN
WERE VERY FAIR TO VIEW NEVERTHELESS ALTHOUGH NONE OF US NOT EVEN UNCLE ROGER OR FELICITY SAID A WORD AT THE TIME FOR FEAR OF HURTING THE STORY GIRL'S FEELINGS THE PUDDING DID NOT TASTE EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD IT WAS TOUGH DECIDEDLY TOUGH
FELICITY AND CECILY STARED BLANKLY AT THE STORY GIRL WE BOYS BEGAN TO LAUGH BUT WERE CHECKED MIDWAY BY UNCLE ROGER HE WAS ROCKING HIMSELF BACK AND FORTH WITH HIS HAND PRESSED AGAINST HIS STOMACH OH HE GROANED
HE STRODE ALONG RIGHT MASTERFULLY AND LIFTED HIS HEAD WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO WAS MONARCH OF ALL HE SURVEYED THE STORY GIRL KISSED HER FINGERTIPS TO HIM WITH THE DELIGHTFUL AUDACITY WHICH WAS A PART OF HER
EVEN CHILDREN CANNOT DEVOUR MINCE PIE AND COLD FRIED PORK HAM AND FRUIT CAKE BEFORE GOING TO BED WITH ENTIRE IMPUNITY AUNT JANET HAD FORGOTTEN TO WARN UNCLE ROGER TO KEEP AN EYE ON OUR BEDTIME SNACKS
WE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM AS WE ROAMED THE WOOD AND DAN AND PETER ALMOST QUARRELLED OVER IT DAN MAINTAINING THAT THE THING WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND PETER BEING OF THE OPINION THAT THE MUSH WAS SOMEHOW MADE THICKER IN THE PROCESS OF BEING EATEN
MISSIONARIES ARE SUCH NOBLE PEOPLE I'D LIKE TO BE A MISSIONARY AND HAVE ADVENTURES LIKE THAT SAID FELIX IT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT IF YOU COULD BE SURE THE CANNIBALS WOULD BE INTERRUPTED IN THE NICK OF TIME AS HIS WERE SAID DAN BUT SPOSEN THEY WEREN'T
WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL UNCLE ROGER STOPPED LAUGHING BEFORE WE HEARD THE EXPLANATION WE THOUGHT HE NEVER WOULD STOP
DIRECTION IT WAS HER DUTY TO UNDO IT IF POSSIBLE AT ANY COST OF RIDICULE TO HERSELF OH FELICITY SHE SAID HER VOICE EXPRESSING A VERY ANGUISH OF HUMILIATION I
PETER HAD GONE HOME TO SEE HIS MOTHER AND UNCLE ROGER HAD GONE TO MARKDALE ON BUSINESS SARA RAY CAME UP BUT WAS SO SNUBBED BY FELICITY THAT SHE WENT HOME CRYING FELICITY GOT THE DINNER BY HERSELF DISDAINING TO ASK OR COMMAND ASSISTANCE
BUT NOBODY HAS TO EAT IT ALL AT ONCE RETORTED UNCLE ROGER WITH ANOTHER GROAN OH SARA STANLEY IT'S A THANKFUL MAN I AM THAT YOUR AUNT OLIVIA IS TO BE HOME TO NIGHT YOU'D HAVE ME KILT ENTIRELY BY ANOTHER DAY
AND TOOK THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHILDREN WHILE THEY WERE AWAY BUT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS LETTING MYSELF IN FOR IF ANYTHING HAD HAPPENED
BUT AT LAST HE WON THROUGH TO THE FURTHEST SIDE BREATHLESS AND REELING HIS VESTURE TORN HIS GREAT WOUNDS BLEEDING HE FOUND HIMSELF ON THE SHORE WHERE THE FOUNTAIN OF IMMORTALITY SPRANG UP
IT'S NOT HALF SO MUCH FUN HAVING THE GROWN UPS AWAY AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE I WISH I WAS BACK IN TORONTO I SAID SULKILY THE MINCE PIE WAS TO BLAME FOR THAT WISH I WISH YOU WERE I'M SURE SAID FELICITY
IS THAT A CONUNDRUM ASKED CECILY CAUTIOUSLY IF IT IS I WON'T TRY TO GUESS THE REASON I NEVER CAN GUESS CONUNDRUMS IT ISN'T A CONUNDRUM SAID FELIX IT'S A FACT THEY DO AND THERE'S A GOOD REASON FOR IT
HER ASCETIC FARE WAS REALLY SWEETER TO HER THAN HONEY OF HYMETTUS SHE WAS THOUGH QUITE UNCONSCIOUSLY ACTING A PART AND TASTING ALL THE SUBTLE JOY OF THE ARTIST WHICH IS SO MUCH MORE EXQUISITE THAN ANY MATERIAL PLEASURE
I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WOULDN'T MIND IF HE'D LAUGH ONCE AND HAVE IT DONE WITH IT
TOLD HER SHE WAS A LITTLE BRICK AND HAD DONE JUST THE RIGHT THING EXAMINED SOME OF THE FATAL BERRIES AND GAVE IT AS HIS OPINION THAT THEY WERE PROBABLY POISONOUS ADMINISTERED SOME POWDERS TO DAN
SAID FELIX THE GIRLS GASPED BUT DAN AND I WERE JUBILANT SNUFFING BATTLE AFAR OFF ALL RIGHT I CAN FIGHT AS WELL AS PRAY OH DON'T FIGHT IMPLORED CECILY I THINK IT WOULD BE DREADFUL
WELL HERE'S THE KEY GO AND SEE FOR YOURSELF SAID PETER FELICITY HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING AND SEEING I THINK YOU BOYS OUGHT TO GO SHE SAID RETREATING BEHIND THE DEFENCE OF SEX YOU OUGHT TO BE BRAVER THAN GIRLS
AND LACKED THE RICHNESS OF FLAVOUR WHICH WAS CUSTOMARY IN AUNT JANET'S CORNMEAL PUDDINGS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE ABUNDANT SUPPLY OF SAUCE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DRY EATING INDEED EATEN IT WAS HOWEVER TO THE LAST CRUMB
ADDED FELICITY HER HEART MELTING AT SIGHT OF THE MISERY IN THE STORY GIRL'S PITEOUS EYES MISSUS RAY ALWAYS LOOKS ON THE DARK SIDE AND IT MAY NOT BE THE MEASLES SARA HAS AFTER ALL BUT FELICITY HAD DONE HER WORK TOO THOROUGHLY
WHERE THE RAINBOW TOUCHED THE EARTH AND THE RAINBOW WAS A GREAT BRIDGE BUILT OF LIVING COLOURS SO DAZZLING AND WONDERFUL THAT BEYOND IT THE EYE COULD SEE NOTHING ONLY FAR AWAY A GREAT BLINDING SPARKLING GLORY
HE GROANED AND TWISTED AND DOUBLED HIMSELF UP BUT HE OVERDID IT HE WAS NOT AS GOOD AN ACTOR AS THE STORY GIRL FELICITY LOOKED SCORNFULLY AT HIM UNCLE ROGER YOU ARE NOT ONE BIT SICK SHE SAID DELIBERATELY YOU ARE JUST PUTTING ON
SHE WAS IN TURN AN ORIENTAL PRINCESS BEHIND A SILKEN VEIL THE BRIDE WHO FOLLOWED HER BRIDEGROOM TO THE WARS OF PALESTINE DISGUISED AS A PAGE THE GALLANT LADY WHO RANSOMED HER DIAMOND NECKLACE BY DANCING A CORANTO
IF IT WERE NOT JUST WHAT A CORNMEAL PUDDING MIGHT BE THE REST OF THE BILL OF FARE HAD BEEN EXTRA GOOD AND OUR APPETITES MATCHED IT I WISH I WAS TWINS SO'S I COULD EAT MORE SAID DAN WHEN HE SIMPLY HAD TO STOP
YOU'D FIND THAT PENANCE ENOUGH THE STORY GIRL WAS CRIMSON WITH INDIGNATION TO HAVE SUCH A REMARK MADE TO YOU WHEN YOU WERE FOURTEEN AND A HALF AND BEFORE THE BOYS TOO REALLY AUNT JANET COULD BE VERY DREADFUL
PAT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN MORE THAN ANY HUMAN BEING EVER KNEW AND I VOW PADDY WOULD LICK HIS CHOPS WITH DELIGHT BUT TO BE CALLED A SWEET CAT OH SARA SARA
I HAVE AN IDEA THAT A RASPBERRY PIE FOR TO MORROW NIGHT WHEN THE FOLKS COME HOME WOULD HIT THE RIGHT SPOT ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA WE ALL SET OFF ARMED WITH JUGS AND CUPS FELICITY THOUGHTFUL CREATURE ALSO TOOK A SMALL BASKETFUL OF JELLY COOKIES ALONG WITH HER
WHEN YOUR FATHER'S RUN AWAY AND YOUR MOTHER GOES OUT WASHING AND YOU'RE ONLY OLD ENOUGH TO GET FIFTY CENTS A WEEK YOU CAN'T GIVE MUCH TO THE HEATHEN BUT I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN MY AUNT JANE WAS FOND OF MISSIONS
WELL WE HAVEN'T ANY ANYHOW SAID FELICITY I SUPPOSE BLUEBERRY WINE WOULDN'T DO IN ITS PLACE
CECILY GAVE A SHRIEK AND RAN OUT OF THE WOOD WE THOUGHT SHE HAD FLED BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE SIGHT OF BLOOD AND WE WERE NOT SORRY FOR HER MANIFEST DISAPPROVAL AND ANXIETY WERE DAMPING THE EXCITEMENT OF THE OCCASION
WITHOUT YOUR DOING ANYTHING SAID CECILY WELL MY CONSCIENCE WILL FEEL BETTER I DON'T BELIEVE PRESBYTERIANS EVER DO PENANCE SAID FELICITY DUBIOUSLY I NEVER HEARD OF ONE DOING IT BUT THE REST OF US RATHER LOOKED WITH FAVOUR ON THE STORY GIRL'S IDEA
GAMBLING WHAT WOULD AUNT JANE SAY IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO FIGHT CECILY DEMANDED OF PETER DON'T YOU DRAG MY AUNT JANE INTO THIS AFFAIR SAID PETER DARKLY YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE A PRESBYTERIAN
BY TEA TIME THINGS HAD BRIGHTENED UP THE RAIN HAD CEASED AND THE OLD LOW RAFTERED ROOM WAS FULL OF SUNSHINE WHICH DANCED ON THE SHINING DISHES OF THE DRESSER MADE MOSAICS ON THE FLOOR
I BELIEVE YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE TO HAVE A STORY TO TELL UNCLE ROGER HOBBLED OFF TO THE BARN STILL HOLDING ON TO HIS STOMACH DO YOU THINK HE REALLY FEELS SICK ASKED THE STORY GIRL ANXIOUSLY NO I DON'T SAID FELICITY
IN WHICH NOBLE AMBITION HE SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY
IF SHE WERE BEING LED TO THE STAKE AND HE RAN AND WAKENED UP A VERY TIRED DOCTOR JUST AS HE HAD GOT TO SLEEP OH DOCTOR MY SON HAS SWALLOWED A MOUSE HE CRIED WHAT SHALL I DO
DO YOU THINK HE'LL EVER TELL YOU WHO ALICE IS I ASKED I HAVE A NOTION WHO ALICE IS ALREADY SAID THE MYSTERIOUS CREATURE BUT SHE WOULD TELL US NOTHING MORE WHEN THE JELLY COOKIES WERE ALL EATEN IT WAS HIGH TIME TO BE MOVING HOMEWARD
I'LL TELL YOU SAID PETER I'LL PICK UP A LOT OF THOSE LITTLE ROUND PEBBLES ON MISTER KING'S FRONT WALK
THE WILD COLD SPRAY BEAT ON HIS EYES AND BLINDED HIM SO THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING AND THE ROAR OF THE RIVER DEAFENED HIM SO THAT HE COULD HEAR NOTHING BUT HE FELT KEENLY THE WOUNDS AND BRUISES OF THE CRUEL ROCKS
AND WE ATE WHAT SEEMED GOOD UNTO US SOME OF US HAD FRIGHTFUL DREAMS AND ALL OF US CARRIED CHIPS ON OUR SHOULDERS AT BREAKFAST FELICITY AND DAN BEGAN A BICKERING WHICH THEY KEPT UP THE ENTIRE DAY FELICITY HAD A NATURAL APTITUDE FOR WHAT WE CALLED BOSSING
YOU'LL DO NOTHING OF THE SORT SAID AUNT JANET SARA MUST NOT DO PENANCE IN THAT WAY SHE WOULD WEAR HOLES IN HER STOCKINGS AND MIGHT SERIOUSLY BRUISE HER FEET WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I TOOK A WHIP AND WHIPPED MY BARE SHOULDERS TILL THE BLOOD CAME
AND I GOT BACK ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO I SET DOWN ON THE FRONT DOOR STEPS FOR A MOMENT AND ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A BELL RING IN THE HOUSE EIGHT TIMES I TELL YOU I WAS SKEERED I MADE A BOLT FOR THE ORCHARD AND YOU WON'T CATCH ME GOING NEAR THAT HOUSE TILL YOUR UNCLE ROGER COMES HOME
WHY TWINS ARE JUST PEOPLE THAT SQUINT AREN'T THEY SAID PETER WE THOUGHT HE WAS TRYING TO BE FUNNY UNTIL WE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS QUITE IN EARNEST THEN WE LAUGHED UNTIL PETER GOT SULKY I DON'T CARE HE SAID HOW'S A FELLOW TO KNOW
CHANCING ACCIDENTALLY I VOW TO OVERHEAR CERTAIN OF THESE SECRETS I LEARNED THAT SARA RAY HAD NAMED AN APPLE FOR JOHNNY PRICE AND CECILY TRUE'S YOU LIVE THERE WAS EIGHT SEEDS IN IT AND YOU KNOW EIGHT MEANS THEY BOTH LOVE
SINCE FELIX SOLEMNLY VOWED CROSS HIS HEART WHITE SHEEP DID EAT MORE THAN BLACK
GIVING UP ALL THEIR WORLDLY POSSESSIONS AND AMBITIONS AND TO THESE HE PROMISED THE GIFT OF ETERNAL LIFE ALL THESE PEOPLE WERE GOOD AND NOBLE AND UNSELFISH AND KIND BUT THE BEST AND NOBLEST OF THEM ALL WAS A YOUTH NAMED VING
SHE MADE HIM SWALLOW EVERY AVAILABLE ANTIDOTE WHICH WAS RECOMMENDED IN THE DOCTOR'S BOOK AND SHE APPLIED HOT CLOTHS TO HIM UNTIL HER FAITHFUL LITTLE HANDS WERE HALF SCALDED OFF THERE WAS NO DOUBT DAN WAS SUFFERING INTENSE PAIN
FELICITY MIGHT CHARM THE PALATE AND THE STORY GIRL BIND CAPTIVE THE SOUL BUT WHEN PAIN AND SICKNESS WRUNG THE BROW IT WAS CECILY WHO WAS THE MINISTERING ANGEL SHE MADE THE WRITHING DAN GO TO BED
TELL HIM TO SWALLOW A CAT ROARED THE POOR DOCTOR AND SLAMMED HIS DOOR NOW IF UNCLE ROGER HAS SWALLOWED ANY NEEDLES MAYBE IT WOULD MAKE IT ALL RIGHT IF HE SWALLOWED A PINCUSHION
AND THAT ALL OUR OLD FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS WERE MOMENTARILY FORGOTTEN AND STRANGE THAT NIGHT WHEN HE POINTED OUT THE STARS TO US FROM THE PULPIT STONE WAS THE LAST TIME FOR SEVERAL WEEKS THAT PETER SHARED OUR TOIL AND PASTIME
TO SIT DOWN TO ONE OF AUNT JANET'S MEALS IN ORDINARY HEALTH AND APPETITE AND EAT NOTHING BUT BREAD AND WATER THAT WOULD BE PENANCE WITH A VENGEANCE WE FELT WE COULD NEVER DO IT BUT THE STORY GIRL DID IT WE ADMIRED AND PITIED HER
FELICITY WAS CUMBERED WITH MANY CARES THE NEXT MORNING FOR ONE THING THE WHOLE HOUSE MUST BE PUT IN APPLE PIE ORDER AND FOR ANOTHER AN ELABORATE SUPPER MUST BE PREPARED FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN OF THE TRAVELLERS THAT NIGHT FELICITY DEVOTED HER WHOLE ATTENTION TO THIS
THE STORY GIRL DOES PENANCE TEN DAYS LATER AUNT OLIVIA AND UNCLE ROGER WENT TO TOWN ONE EVENING TO REMAIN OVER NIGHT AND THE NEXT DAY PETER AND THE STORY GIRL WERE TO STAY AT UNCLE ALEC'S DURING THEIR ABSENCE WE WERE IN THE ORCHARD AT SUNSET
SHUT UP HE SAID I SHUT UP FELICITY AND CECILY WERE SETTING OUT A LUNCH IN THE PANTRY WHEN WE WERE ALL STARTLED BY A LOUD GROAN FROM THE SOFA
THERE'S NO SENSE IN CALLING PETER LAZY YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY I HAD BLACK HAIR OF COURSE PETER BEING A CRAIG HAS HIS FAULTS BUT HE'S A SMART BOY HIS FATHER WAS LAZY BUT HIS MOTHER HASN'T A LAZY BONE IN HER BODY AND PETER TAKES AFTER HER
HAD NOT THE THOUGHT OF SWEET ALIN'S LOVING EYES BROUGHT HIM THE STRENGTH AND DESIRE TO STRUGGLE AS LONG AS IT WAS POSSIBLE LONG LONG LONG TO HIM SEEMED THAT BITTER AND PERILOUS PASSAGE
PETER AND THE STORY GIRL KNEW ALL ABOUT THEM AND IMPARTED THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO US GENEROUSLY I RECALL PETER STANDING ON THE PULPIT STONE ONE NIGHT ERE MOONRISE AND POINTING THEM OUT TO US
CECILY AND SARA RAY FOUND A SWEET NEW KNITTED LACE PATTERN IN AN OLD MAGAZINE
JUST THINK HOW DREADFUL IT WOULD BE IF OUR FATHER HAD LEFT US LIKE THAT OUR FATHER IS A KING SAID FELICITY LOFTILY AND PETER'S FATHER WAS ONLY A CRAIG A MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY COULDN'T BEHAVE LIKE THAT
THEY AND ONLY THEY CAN BRING US TIDINGS FROM THAT DEAR COUNTRY WHERE WE ONCE SOJOURNED AND FROM WHICH WE MUST EVERMORE BE EXILES THE WORLD CALLS THEM ITS SINGERS AND POETS AND ARTISTS AND STORY TELLERS
CECILY KEEP QUIET NOW ONE TWO THREE PETER AND FELIX PITCHED IN WITH MORE ZEAL THAN DISCRETION ON BOTH SIDES AS A RESULT PETER GOT WHAT LATER DEVELOPED INTO A BLACK EYE AND FELIX'S NOSE BEGAN TO BLEED
AND THAT IS THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE ON THAT DAY THE GATES OF EDEN ARE SHUT BEHIND THEM AND THE AGE OF GOLD IS OVER HENCEFORTH THEY MUST DWELL IN THE COMMON LIGHT OF COMMON DAY ONLY A FEW WHO REMAIN CHILDREN AT HEART CAN EVER FIND THAT FAIR LOST PATH AGAIN
WE MIGHT DISPOSE OF THEM AS WE WILLED FELICITY SOLD HERS TO UNCLE ALEC'S HIRED MAN AND WAS BADLY CHEATED TO BOOT FOR HE LEVANTED SHORTLY AFTERWARDS TAKING THE APPLES WITH HIM HAVING PAID HER ONLY HALF HER RIGHTFUL DUE
CECILY HOW OLD MUST WE BE BEFORE WE CAN HAVE A REAL BEAU BUT SARA ALWAYS DENIED IT SO I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE FELIX SIMPLY MADE IT UP HIMSELF PADDY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF BY CATCHING A RAT
WHERE ELSE COULD SHE HAVE CAUGHT THEM SAID FELICITY MERCILESSLY I DIDN'T SEE HER OF COURSE
AUNT JANET OF COURSE NOTICED THE STORY GIRL'S ABSTINENCE AND ASKED IF SHE WAS SICK NO
IN THE MORNING AND AT DINNER TIME AND AT NIGHT AND BESIDES THAT ANY TIME THROUGH THE DAY WHEN HE HAPPENS TO THINK OF IT HE JUST PRAYS STANDING UP DID YOU EVER HEAR OF SUCH GOINGS ON WELL
I WISH MA HAD NEVER GONE AWAY I WISH YOU'D LEAVE FELICITY ALONE DAN I WISH GIRLS HAD SOME SENSE SAID DAN WHICH BROUGHT THE ORGY OF WISHING TO AN END FOR THE TIME
ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT IN SOME PLACES AFTER SPENDING THE WHOLE DAY TO WITHIN HALF AN HOUR OR SO OF SUNDOWN I WAS STILL SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET BELOW THE SUMMIT THEN MY HOPES WERE REDUCED
PURPLISH BROWN IN COLOR AND USUALLY ENLIVENED WITH TUFTS OF A YELLOW LICHEN TOWARD THE HEAD OF THIS MAGNIFICENT COLUMN LONG BRANCHES SWEEP GRACEFULLY OUTWARD AND DOWNWARD SOMETIMES FORMING A PALM LIKE CROWN
AND OFFER NO APPRECIABLE RESISTANCE IN WALKING THROUGH THEM ALONG THE EDGES OF THE MEADOWS BENEATH THE PINES AND THROUGHOUT THE GREATER PART OF THE VALLEY TALL RIBBON LEAVED GRASSES GROW IN ABUNDANCE CHIEFLY BROMUS
ITS FINE COLOR AND PICTURESQUENESS ARE APPRECIATED BY ARTISTS BUT TO ME THE JUNIPER SEEMS A SINGULARLY STRANGE AND TACITURN TREE I HAVE SPENT MANY A DAY AND NIGHT IN ITS COMPANY
AND I WAS SWISHED DOWN TO THE FOOT OF THE CANYON AS IF BY ENCHANTMENT THE WALLOWING ASCENT HAD TAKEN NEARLY ALL DAY THE DESCENT ONLY ABOUT A MINUTE WHEN THE AVALANCHE STARTED
THAT ONE MAY RIDE A MULE TO THE VERY SUMMIT ACROSS MANY A BUSY STREAM FROM MEADOW TO MEADOW LIES YOUR FLOWERY WAY MOUNTAINS ALL ABOUT YOU FEW OF THEM HIDDEN BY IRREGULAR FOREGROUNDS
THE UPPER TUOLUMNE EXCURSION WE COME NOW TO THE GRANDEST OF ALL THE YOSEMITE EXCURSIONS ONE THAT REQUIRES AT LEAST TWO OR THREE WEEKS THE BEST TIME TO MAKE IT IS FROM ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF JULY
COMPELLING HUGE SLEEPING BOULDERS TO WAKE UP AND JOIN IN THEIR DANCE AND SONG TO SWELL THEIR EXULTING CHORUS IN EARLY SUMMER AFTER THE FLOOD SEASON THE YOSEMITE STREAMS ARE IN THEIR PRIME
TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY
AND BURROWING MARMOTS MOUNTAIN BEAVERS WOOD RATS AND OTHER SMALL MOUNTAIN PEOPLE GO INTO WINTER QUARTERS SOME OF THEM NOT AGAIN TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY UNTIL THE GENERAL AWAKENING AND RESURRECTION OF THE SPRING
BOUNDED BY ITS SNOWY PEAKS IN GLORIOUS ARRAY SOUTHWARD YOSEMITE AND WESTWARD THE VAST FOREST ON NO OTHER YOSEMITE PARK MOUNTAIN ARE YOU MORE LIKELY TO LINGER YOU WILL FIND IT A MAGNIFICENT SKY CAMP
THENCE PUSH ON PAST TENAYA LAKE INTO THE TUOLUMNE MEADOWS AND ESTABLISH A CENTRAL CAMP NEAR THE SODA SPRINGS FROM WHICH GLORIOUS EXCURSIONS CAN BE MADE AT YOUR LEISURE
WE COME WITHIN A FEW MILES TO THE VERNAL AND NEVADA FALLS FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX HUNDRED FEET HIGH
AND ON EVERY SUMMIT A MAGNIFICENT SILVERY BANNER FROM TWO THOUSAND TO SIX THOUSAND FEET IN LENGTH SLENDER AT THE POINT OF ATTACHMENT AND WIDENING GRADUALLY UNTIL ABOUT A THOUSAND
IT IS ALSO THE MOST ACCESSIBLE IT IS IN THE HEART OF THE HIGH SIERRA EAST OF YOSEMITE
AND ITS DEEPLY SCULPTURED FOUNTAIN PEAKS CALLED
AT LENGTH ALL THEIR PLANS PERFECTED TUFTED FLAKES AND SINGLE STARRY CRYSTALS COME IN SIGHT SOLEMNLY SWIRLING AND GLINTING TO THEIR BLESSED APPOINTED PLACES
THE CONES ARE FROM FOUR TO EIGHT INCHES LONG SMOOTH SLENDER CYLINDRICAL AND SOMEWHAT CURVED THEY GROW IN CLUSTERS OF FROM THREE TO SIX OR SEVEN AND BECOME PENDULOUS AS THEY INCREASE IN WEIGHT
THE TWO LEAVED PINE THE TWO LEAVED PINE PINUS CONTORTA
THE DOUGLAS SPRUCE LIBOCEDRUS SEQUOIA AND THE SILVER FIR ARE ALSO MORE OR LESS ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT ON MANY DEEP SOILED MOUNTAIN SIDES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
AND BLOWN HORIZONTALLY ALONG THE FACE OF THE CLIFF LEAVING THE ICE HILL DRY AND WHILE MAKING MY WAY TO THE TOP OF FERN LEDGE TO SEIZE SO FAVORABLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK DOWN ITS THROAT
IN JUNE OR JULY THE FERTILE CLOUDS DROOPING AND CONDENSING IN BROODING SILENCE SEEM TO BE THOUGHTFULLY EXAMINING THE FORESTS AND STREAMS WITH REFERENCE TO THE WORK THAT LIES BEFORE THEM
THE GRAY PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL RANGE BOUNDS IT ON THE SOUTH A SIMILAR RANGE OR SPUR THE HIGHEST PEAK OF WHICH IS MOUNT CONNESS ON THE NORTH THE NOBLE MOUNTS DANA GIBBS MAMMOTH LYELL
EVENING CAME ON JUST AS I GOT FAIRLY INTO THE MAIN CANYON IT IS ABOUT A MILE WIDE AND A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO MILES LONG
THAT ARE FROM TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OLD STILL HOLDING BRAVELY TO LIFE MAKING THE MOST OF THEIR SLENDER SUMMERS SHAKING THEIR TASSELED NEEDLES IN THE BREEZE RIGHT CHEERILY
ITS LOWER ABOUT FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED FEET IT IS REMARKABLE FOR ITS LOOSE AIRY WIDE BRANCHING HABIT AND THIN GRAY FOLIAGE FULL GROWN SPECIMENS ARE FROM FORTY TO FIFTY FEET IN HEIGHT
NO MOUNTAIN TOP COULD BE BETTER PLACED FOR THIS MOST GLORIOUS OF MOUNTAIN VIEWS TO WATCH AND SEE THE DEEPENING COLORS OF THE DAWN AND THE SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE SNOWY HIGH SIERRA PASSES
AND WE SHALL BE GLAD TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH THEM WE WILL STAY HERE AND BE FRIENDS MY PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE PLAINS SOME OF THE TRIBES WHO HAVE GONE THERE ARE VERY BAD WE CANNOT LIVE WITH THEM HERE WE CAN DEFEND OURSELVES
IT SEEMS TO BE A SURVIVOR OF SOME ANCIENT RACE WHOLLY UNACQUAINTED WITH ITS NEIGHBORS ITS BROAD STUMPINESS OF COURSE MAKES WIND WAVING OR EVEN SHAKING OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT IT IS NOT THIS ROCKY RIGIDITY THAT CONSTITUTES ITS SILENCE
LINGER HERE IF NIGHT IS STILL DISTANT FOR VIEWS OF THIS FAVORITE FALL AND THE STUPENDOUS ROCK SCENERY ABOUT IT THEN DESCEND A STAIRWAY BY ITS SIDE FOLLOW A DIM TRAIL THROUGH ITS SPRAY
ALL THE WIDE FAN SHAPED UPPER PORTION OF THE BASIN IS COVERED WITH A NETWORK OF SMALL RILLS THAT GO CHEERILY ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR GRAND FALL IN THE VALLEY NOW FLOWING ON SMOOTH PAVEMENTS IN SHEETS THIN AS GLASS
THE GREAT CENTURY AVALANCHES AND THE KIND THAT MOW WIDE SWATHS THROUGH THE UPPER FORESTS OCCUR ON MOUNTAIN SIDES ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE THOUSAND FEET HIGH
AND FOLLOW THE DIVIDE TO CLOUDS REST AFTER A GLORIOUS VIEW FROM THE CREST OF THIS LOFTY GRANITE WAVE YOU WILL FIND A TRAIL ON ITS WESTERN END THAT WILL LEAD YOU DOWN PAST NEVADA AND VERNAL FALLS
BY MISTER HUTCHINGS ALL THESE HOTELS HAVE VANISHED EXCEPT THE FRAME HOUSE BUILT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION A LARGE HOTEL BUILT ON THE BRINK OF THE RIVER IN FRONT OF THE OLD ONE
CATHEDRAL SPIRES UNICORN PEAK AND A SERIES OF ORNAMENTAL NAMELESS COMPANIONS RISING IN STRIKING FORMS AND NEARNESS ABOVE A DENSE FOREST GROWING ON THE LEFT
THE BEAUTIFUL LITTLE YOSEMITE VALLEY AND ITS MANY DOMES THE STARR KING CLUSTER OF DOMES SENTINEL DOME GLACIER POINT AND PERHAPS THE MOST TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSIVE OF ALL
I WAS AWAKENED EARLY IN THE MORNING BY A WILD STORM WIND AND OF COURSE I HAD TO MAKE HASTE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE VALLEY TO ENJOY IT RUGGED TORRENTS AND AVALANCHES
TO THE WESTWARD THE LANDSCAPE IS MADE UP OF EXCEEDINGLY STRONG GRAY GLACIATED DOMES AND RIDGE WAVES MOST OF THEM COMPARATIVELY LOW BUT THE LARGEST HIGH ENOUGH TO BE CALLED MOUNTAINS
THE YOSEMITE OR GRIZZLY BEAR TRIBE FANCYING THEMSELVES SECURE IN THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD WERE THE MOST TROUBLESOME AND DEFIANT OF ALL AND IT WAS WHILE THE MARIPOSA BATTALION UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR SAVAGE
ITS MOST CONSTANT COMPANION IS THE YELLOW PINE
ACROSS THE VALLEY FROM HERE NEXT TO THE BRIDAL VEIL ARE THE PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL ROCKS NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH MAKING A NOBLE DISPLAY OF FINE YET MASSIVE SCULPTURE
SWEEPING IN BEAUTIFUL CURVES FROM THE HOLLOWS AND CANYONS
BESIDES THESE COMMON AFTER STORM AVALANCHES THAT ARE TO BE FOUND NOT ONLY IN THE YOSEMITE BUT IN ALL THE DEEP SHEER WALLED CANYON OF THE RANGE THERE ARE TWO OTHER IMPORTANT KINDS
NOBLE AS THESE ARE THE SUGAR PINE IS EASILY KING AND SPREADS HIS ARMS ABOVE THEM IN BLESSING WHILE THEY ROCK AND WAVE IN SIGN OF RECOGNITION THE MAIN BRANCHES ARE SOMETIMES FORTY FEET LONG YET PERSISTENTLY SIMPLE
THE GROVES ABOUT THE SODA SPRINGS ARE FAVORITE CAMPING GROUNDS ON ACCOUNT OF THE COLD PLEASANT TASTING WATER CHARGED WITH CARBONIC ACID AND BECAUSE OF THE VIEWS OF THE MOUNTAINS ACROSS THE MEADOW THE GLACIER MONUMENT CATHEDRAL PEAK
AND HUNDREDS OF SMOOTH ROCK WAVES THAT APPEAR TO BE COMING ROLLING ON TOWARDS YOU LIKE HIGH HEAVING WAVES READY TO BREAK
SLIM ERECT WITH LEAFY BRANCHES KEPT EXACTLY IN PLACE EACH TAPERING IN OUTLINE AND TERMINATING IN A SPIRY POINT THE SUCCESSIVE FORMS BETWEEN THE CAUTIOUS NEATNESS OF YOUTH AND THE BOLD FREEDOM OF MATURITY
IN ALL MY MOUNTAINEERING I HAVE ENJOYED ONLY ONE AVALANCHE RIDE AND THE START WAS SO SUDDEN AND THE END CAME SO SOON I HAD BUT LITTLE TIME TO THINK OF THE DANGER THAT ATTENDS THIS SORT OF TRAVEL
THE SUGAR FROM WHICH THE COMMON NAME IS DERIVED IS I THINK THE BEST OF SWEETS IT EXUDES FROM THE HEART WOOD WHERE WOUNDS HAVE BEEN MADE BY FOREST FIRES OR THE AX AND FORMS IRREGULAR CRISP
WHEN THE CAPTIVES WERE ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF THE TWO WHITE MEN THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD KILLED THEM TO PREVENT WHITE MEN FROM COMING TO THEIR VALLEY DECLARING THAT IT WAS THEIR HOME AND THAT WHITE MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO COME THERE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
IN SHELTERED LAKE HOLLOWS ON BEDS OF ALLUVIUM THIS PINE VARIES SO FAR FROM THE COMMON FORM THAT FREQUENTLY IT COULD BE TAKEN FOR A DISTINCT SPECIES GROWING IN DAMP SODS LIKE GRASSES FROM FORTY TO EIGHTY FEET HIGH
THEY ARE TWENTY MILES AWAY BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH THEM NEARER FOR EVERY FEATURE IS DISTINCT AND THE WHOLE WONDERFUL SHOW IS SEEN IN ITS RIGHT PROPORTIONS LIKE A PAINTING ON THE SKY
AND AS THE WHOLE MASS BENEATH AND ABOUT ME JOINED IN THE FLIGHT THERE WAS NO FRICTION THOUGH I WAS TOSSED HERE AND THERE AND LURCHED FROM SIDE TO SIDE WHEN THE AVALANCHE SWEDGED AND CAME TO REST
AND SEEMING TO SPRING OUT INTO THE VALLEY SUNSHINE DIRECT FROM THE SKY BUT EVEN THIS FALL PERHAPS THE MOST WONDERFUL OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD CANNOT AT FIRST HOLD OUR ATTENTION FOR NOW THE WIDE UPPER PORTION OF THE VALLEY IS DISPLAYED TO VIEW
I THREW MYSELF ON MY BACK AND SPREAD MY ARMS TO TRY TO KEEP FROM SINKING FORTUNATELY THOUGH THE GRADE OF THE CANYON IS VERY STEEP IT IS NOT INTERRUPTED BY PRECIPICES LARGE ENOUGH TO CAUSE OUTBOUNDING OR FREE PLUNGING
WHICH SWEEP UP TO THE FEET OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS IN A DWARFED FRINGE TO A HEIGHT OF FROM TEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND FEET THAT THIS GENERAL ORDER OF DISTRIBUTION DEPENDS ON CLIMATE AS AFFECTED BY HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA IS SEEN AT ONCE
BUT MORAINES VANISH LIKE THE GLACIERS THAT MAKE THEM EVERY STORM THAT FALLS UPON THEM WASTES THEM CARRYING AWAY THEIR DECAYING DISINTEGRATING MATERIAL INTO NEW FORMATIONS UNTIL THEY ARE NO LONGER RECOGNIZABLE
WITH A SLOPE OF ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT DEGREES CLIMBING TO THE TOP OF IT I DISCOVERED A VERY SMALL BUT WELL CHARACTERIZED GLACIER SWOOPING DOWN FROM THE SHADOWY CLIFFS OF THE MOUNTAIN TO ITS TERMINAL MORAINE
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE MOUNTAIN GO FAR ENOUGH DOWN THE NORTH SIDE FOR A VIEW OF THE DANA GLACIER
TO THE EASTWARD YOU GAZE FAR OUT OVER THE DESERT PLAINS AND MOUNTAINS OF THE GREAT BASIN RANGE BEYOND RANGE EXTENDING WITH SOFT OUTLINES BLUE AND PURPLE IN THE DISTANCE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND FEET BELOW YOU LIES LAKE MONO
BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND WHEN I AM DEAD I WILL CALL MY PEOPLE TO COME AND THEY SHALL HEAR ME IN THEIR SLEEP AND COME TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THEIR CHIEF AND HIS SON YES SIR AMERICA MY SPIRIT WILL MAKE TROUBLE FOR YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
WE FIND THAT THE MAIN CAUSES OF THE WONDROUS BEAUTY AND PERFECTION OF THOSE WE ARE LOOKING AT ARE THE FAVORABLE DIRECTION AND FORCE OF THE WIND THE ABUNDANCE OF SNOW DUST AND THE FORM OF THE NORTH SIDES OF THE PEAKS
ENTERING THE VALLEY GAZING OVERWHELMED WITH THE MULTITUDE OF GRAND OBJECTS ABOUT US PERHAPS THE FIRST TO FIX OUR ATTENTION WILL BE THE BRIDAL VEIL A BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL ON OUR RIGHT ITS BROW
AND TRANSLUCENT TOWARD THE END SO THAT THE PARTS OF THE PEAKS PAST WHICH THEY ARE STREAMING LOOK DIM AS IF SEEN THROUGH A VEIL OF GROUND GLASS AND SEE HOW SOME OF THE LONGEST OF THE BANNERS
AND PILING THEIR UPROOTED TREES HEAD DOWNWARD IN ROWS ALONG THE SIDES OF THE GAPS LIKE LATERAL MORAINES SCARS AND BROKEN BRANCHES OF THE TREES STANDING ON THE SIDES OF THE GAPS RECORD THE DEPTH OF THE OVERWHELMING FLOOD
COMBINED WITH INEFFABLE FINENESS OF BEAUTY DRAGGING YOURSELF AWAY GO TO THE HEAD OF THE RIBBON FALL THENCE ACROSS THE BEAUTIFUL RIBBON CREEK BASIN TO THE BIG OAK FLAT STAGE ROAD
FIND THIS SNOW DUST IN A LOOSE CONDITION ON THE SLOPES ABOVE THE TIMBER LINE
MY YOUNG MEN BELIEVED THAT THE GOLD DIGGERS WERE OUR ENEMIES
WHICH BROAD DEEP AND FAR REACHING EXERTED VAST INFLUENCE ON THE SCENERY OF THIS PORTION OF THE SIERRA BUT THERE ARE FINE CAMPING GROUNDS
ABOVE THE SILVER FIR ZONE FORMS THE BULK OF THE ALPINE FORESTS UP TO A HEIGHT OF FROM EIGHT THOUSAND
AND IN THEIR DRESS GAIT GESTURES AND GENERAL BEHAVIOR THEY ARE MUCH ALIKE AVALANCHES
IS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND FEET WHILE THE DISTANCE IS ONLY ABOUT TEN MILES AN AVERAGE FALL OF SIX HUNDRED FEET PER MILE THE LAST MILE OF ITS COURSE
CANDY LIKE KERNELS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE SOMETHING LIKE CLUSTERS OF RESIN BEADS WHEN FRESH IT IS WHITE BUT BECAUSE MOST OF THE WOUNDS ON WHICH IT IS FOUND HAVE BEEN MADE BY FIRE
ON THE HIGHEST PEAKS ARE STREAMING PERFECTLY FREE FROM PEAK TO PEAK ACROSS INTERVENING NOTCHES OR PASSES WHILE OTHERS OVERLAP AND PARTLY HIDE ONE ANOTHER AS TO THEIR FORMATION
STORM THEN FOLLOWS STORM IN QUICK SUCCESSION BURYING THE MEADOWS TO A DEPTH OF FROM TEN TO TWENTY FEET WHILE MAGNIFICENT AVALANCHES DESCEND THROUGH THE FORESTS FROM THE LADEN HEIGHTS
A DULL RUSHING RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD WHICH RAPIDLY INCREASES AND SEEMS TO DRAW NEARER WITH APPALLING INTENSITY OF TONE PRESENTLY THE WHITE FLOOD COMES BOUNDING INTO SIGHT OVER BOSSES AND SHEER PLACES
ARRIVING AT THE FOOT OF A TREE
VARYING GREATLY IN FORM SIZE BEHAVIOR AND IN THE SONGS THEY SING SOME ON THE SMOOTH SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE SHORT AND BROAD OTHERS LONG AND RIVER LIKE IN THE SIDE CANYONS OF YOSEMITES
ON THE SOUTH THE VAST GRANITE WAVE OF CLOUDS REST A MILE IN HEIGHT AND BETWEEN THEM THE FINE TENAYA CASCADE WITH SILVERY PLUMES OUTSPREAD ON SMOOTH GLACIER POLISHED FOLDS OF GRANITE
HOW WELL THEY SING IN THE WIND AND HOW STRIKINGLY HARMONIOUS AN EFFECT IS MADE BY THE LONG CYLINDRICAL CONES DEPENDING LOOSELY FROM THE ENDS OF THE LONG BRANCHES THE CONES ARE ABOUT FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN INCHES LONG AND THREE IN DIAMETER
AND ARE NOW SINGING THEIR BEST SONGS WITH THE STREAMS IN TRANQUIL MELLOW AUTUMN WHEN THE YEAR'S WORK IS ABOUT DONE AND THE FRUITS ARE RIPE BIRDS AND SEEDS OUT OF THEIR NESTS
TEN MILES IN DIAMETER FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AND FOURTEEN FROM WEST TO EAST LYING BARE IN THE TREELESS DESERT LIKE A DISK OF BURNISHED METAL THOUGH AT TIMES IT IS SWEPT BY MOUNTAIN STORM WINDS AND STREAKED WITH FOAM
THE FOREST TREES IN GENERAL FOR THE USE OF THE EVER INCREASING NUMBER OF YOSEMITE VISITORS WHO MAKE EXTENSIVE EXCURSIONS INTO THE MOUNTAINS BEYOND THE VALLEY A SKETCH OF THE FOREST TREES IN GENERAL WILL PROBABLY BE FOUND USEFUL
ARE CONTINUED IN STRAGGLING MASSES ALONG THE WALLS
GLACIER LAKES AND GLACIER MEADOWS ET CETERA BUT SECTIONS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SILVER FIR
WHILE THE GLACIER MEADOWS WILL BE IN THEIR GLORY AND THE SNOW ON THE MOUNTAINS WILL BE FIRM ENOUGH TO MAKE CLIMBING SAFE LONG AGO I MADE THESE SIERRA TRIPS CARRYING ONLY A SACKFUL OF BREAD WITH A LITTLE TEA AND SUGAR AND WAS THUS INDEPENDENT AND FREE
IN THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF JEFF'S CHARACTER IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD NONE OF THE USUAL WELL KNOWN TRAITS OF THE PIG HE WAS MORE LIKE A PETTED AND PAMPERED DOG
IN CANADA WITH A LYNX BY ROE L HENDRICK THIS ADVENTURE CAME ABOUT THROUGH AN INVITATION WHICH RAY CHURCHILL RECEIVED FROM HIS FRIEND JACQUES POURBIERE OF TWO RIVERS NEW BRUNSWICK
WITH THE DUSK WE STOLE OUT INTO THE FIELD WHERE THE STONE HEAPS WERE AND WHERE WE HAD OFTENEST HEARD FOXES BARK SELECTING A NOOK IN THE EDGE OF A CLUMP OF RASPBERRY BRIARS WHICH GREW ABOUT A GREAT PINE STUMP
THEY SAVORED AS STRONGLY OF MICE AS TOM'S QUESTION OF BAD GRAMMAR AND DON'T FOXES CATCH MICE DEMANDED TOM CONFIDENTLY YES BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S GOING TO CATCH THE FOX I SAID
THAT MADE A NOISE WELL NIGH AS LOUD AS A GUN WHEN WE GAVE JUST THE RIGHT SORT OF BLOW THE TROUT BELOW WOULD TURN ON THEIR BACKS AND FLOAT UP TO THE ICE JOHN AND I SOON SECURED TWO GOOD STRINGS OF TROUT AND BY THIS TIME WILLIS
HE PROMISED RAY AT LEAST ONE DEER WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS AND ANOTHER WITHIN A WEEK THE POURBIERE HOME RESEMBLED THOSE OF THE BETTER CLASS OF HABITANTS BUT WITH A DIFFERENCE DUE TO THE GREATER PROSPERITY OF THE FAMILY IN PRECEDING GENERATIONS
BUT PLAINLY FINDING NO GUNS AND AS PLAINLY GETTING COLDER EVERY MINUTE SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AT ONCE HE CLUTCHED A FLAT IRON IN EACH HAND SCREWED HIS COURAGE TO THE STICKING POINT AND DROPPED TO THE FLOOR
AND TOOK ANOTHER LOOK AT THE WHALE THE CREATURE WAS NOT DEAD YET AND THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ANY BLOOD COMING FROM ITS SPOUT HOLES IN FACT IT SEEMED TO BE SPOUTING ALL RIGHT AND WAS NOT CIRCLING AROUND ANY MORE BUT WAS SWIMMING SLOWLY AHEAD WHAT DID IT MEAN
AND NOT ONE OF MY ACORNS HAS SPROUTED UNDER YOUR SHADE BUT BEFORE I DIE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE NAME YOU GIVE TO SUCH CONDUCT THAT WILL NOT TAKE LONG TO SAY OLD FRIEND ANSWERED THE BEECHES
NO SAID THE HEAD BEE NURSE THAT IS NOT SO
FAST RUNNING OUT OF ITS TUB FASTER AND FASTER IT RAN UNTIL WITH A JERK THE END FLEW FROM THE TUB AND I THOUGHT I WAS FREE BUT ALAS NO FOR WHEN THE CREW WERE BEING CHANGED ONE OF THEM HAD FASTENED THE SMALL TUB WHICH IS USED FOR A DRAG IN THE END OF THE LINE
WHEN THE GULF OF MEXICO ROLLED ITS WARM AND SHALLOW WATERS AS FAR NORTH AS ESCANABA AND EAU CLAIRE IN FACT AN IMMENSELY LONG TIME AGO THERE LIVED SOMEWHERE IN OCONTO COUNTY WISCONSIN A LITTLE JELLY FISH
HE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN IN THE LAP OF ONE OF THE SAILORS HAVING HIS BACK STROKED HIS PLEASURE UPON THOSE OCCASIONS WAS EVINCED BY THE EMISSION OF FREQUENT GOOD NATURED GRUNTS AND LOOKING UP INTO THE FACE OF THE FRIENDLY STROKER
BUT I FIND THAT HE IS FOOLISH AND SAUCY INSTEAD
WHEN THE SPRING CAME AND THE SOUTH WINDS BLEW IT BEGAN TO THAW UP THEN THE ICE CAME SLIDING DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND HILLS TEARING UP ROCKS LITTLE AND BIG
AT LAST WE GET A LITTLE APPRECIATION SAID THE OLD OAK BUT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT WITH OUR LIVES THEN HE SAID TO THE BEECH TREES WHAT WAS I THINKING OF WHEN I HELPED YOU ON IN YOUR YOUNG DAYS
SOON AFTERWARDS HOWEVER HE WENT SINGING UPWARDS INTO THE BRIGHT BLUE SKY BY DEGREES HIS VOICE DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TILL THE GREEN CATERPILLAR COULD NOT HEAR A SOUND
HE WAS SEEN AFTER HE HAD RUN A FEW YARDS TO MAKE A GREAT JUMP AND THEN REMAIN IN HIS TRACKS THE PURSUING PARTY FOUND HIM ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DEMOLISHING A MOCCASIN WHICH HE HAD CRUSHED BY JUMPING AND LANDING WITH HIS FEET UPON ITS HEAD AND BACK
INTERRUPTED THE LARK HOW AM I TO LEARN FAITH ASKED THE CATERPILLAR AT THAT MOMENT SHE FELT SOMETHING AT HER SIDE SHE LOOKED ROUND EIGHT OR TEN LITTLE GREEN CATERPILLARS WERE MOVING ABOUT
NOW BOYS GIVE WAY TO YOUR OARS AND YOU STEWARD
WAS LEFT STANDING ALONE BY THE SIDE OF THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS A PRETTY NURSE SHE HAS CHOSEN INDEED POOR LADY EXCLAIMED SHE AND A PRETTY BUSINESS I HAVE IN HAND WHY HER SENSES MUST HAVE LEFT HER
AND WITH IT COMPLETELY COVERED HIMSELF THE PILE NOW RESEMBLED AN ENORMOUS MOUSE NEST OR RATHER A SMALL HAY COCK
TREES BUT TREES THERE WERE IN PLENTY THEY STOOD EVERYWHERE FROM COAST TO COAST THEY SAW THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN ALL THE RIVERS AND LAKES AND STRETCHED THEIR MIGHTY BOUGHS UP TOWARDS HEAVEN
I SEEMED TO FEEL THE CRUNCHING OF THE BOAT'S TIMBERS IN THOSE AWFUL JAWS AND I MUST HAVE SWOONED IN LOOKING FORWARD TO MY OWN TERRIBLE FATE WHEN I REGAINED MY SENSES ALL WAS QUIET AROUND ME OFF THE SIDE OF THE BOAT AT SOME DISTANCE A WHALE FLOATED ON THE WATER
WHO GAVE THE LITTLE OAK A CLOUT ON THE HEAD WITH ONE OF HIS LOWEST BOUGHS HOLD YOUR TONGUE HE SAID AND DON'T TALK TILL YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT YOU NEED NONE OF YOU BELIEVE A WORD OF THE BEAR'S NONSENSE
THIS IS A WEATHER BREEDER GRANDMOTHER REMARKED AT BREAKFAST
AND THEY PERSPIRED AS WELL AS THEY HAD LEARNED TO AND THE PRETTIEST YELLOW WAX CAME OUT OF THEIR BODIES GOOD SAID THE QUEEN NOW WE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD THE OLD BEES TOOK THE WAX AND BEGAN TO BUILD A NUMBER OF LITTLE SIX SIDED CELLS ALL ALIKE AND CLOSE UP TO ONE ANOTHER
POSSIBLY HOWEVER RATHER MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THE AVERAGE CANINE PET THE FOURTH OF JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO WAS A GALA DAY AT ROANOKE ISLAND
THE BOAT STOPPED WITH A JERK AND UNCOVERING MY FACE I SAW A SIGHT THAT MADE ME SCREAM WITH FRIGHT
AND SHE HEAVED A DEEP SIGH FOR HER WORK WAS THE HARDEST WORK OF ALL SHE SAT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIVE AND BEGAN TO LAY HER EGGS SHE LAID GREAT HEAPS OF THEM
I SOON HAD ONE OF THE CANDLES LIGHTED I SAT DOWN ON THE AFTER THWART AND HELD THE LIGHT ALOFT TILL MY ARM ACHED EVERYTHING ABOUT ME WAS MADE MORE WEIRD BY THE GLEAM OF THE LANTERN
AND EVERY MORNING WHEN THE SUN CAME OUT THEY PEEPED DOWN TO LOOK FOR THE BEECHES THEY WERE REALLY A LITTLE UNEASY BUT THEY WERE TOO PROUD TO TALK ABOUT IT AND ONE DAY THE LITTLE SHOOTS DID AT LAST BURST FORTH FROM THE EARTH
AND AT LAST QUITE OVERTOPPED THE LITTLE OAK KEEP YOUR LEAVES TO YOURSELF CRIED THE OAK YOU OVERSHADOW ME AND THAT IS WHAT I CAN'T ENDURE I MUST HAVE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE
POWDER POST BY C A STEPHENS THERE IS A TINY BORER WHICH EATS SEASONED OAK WOOD BORING THOUSANDS OF MINUTE HOLES THROUGH IT TILL IT BECOMES A MERE SHELL AND TURNING OUT A FINE WHITE POWDER KNOWN AMONG COUNTRY FOLK AS POWDER POST
THE SNOW LAY HIGH OVER THE WHOLE LAND AND EVERY TREE STOOD DEEP IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND DREAMT OF THE SPRING AND WHEN THE SPRING CAME THE GRASS STOOD GREEN AND THE BIRDS BEGAN SINGING WHERE THEY LEFT OFF LAST
IT WAS IN A LAND DOWN TOWARDS THE SOUTH THERE I TOOK A NAP UNDER THE BEECH TREES THEY ARE TALL SLIM TREES NOT CROOKED OLD THINGS LIKE YOU AND THEIR TOPS ARE SO DENSE THAT THE SUNBEAMS CANNOT CREEP THROUGH THEM
THE BEAR THE WOLF AND THE FOX WENT OUT HUNTING WHILE THE STAG GRAZED BY THE EDGE OF THE FEN THE FIELD MOUSE SAT OUTSIDE HIS HOLE AND ATE ACORNS AND THE BEAVER BUILT HIS ARTISTIC HOUSES BY THE RIVER BANKS
THEY MADE A RUDE SLED OF SAPLINGS OF THE KIND KNOWN TO HUNTERS AS A SCOOT AND DREW THE BEAR HOME
BUT I WANT TO BE QUEEN CRIED THE GRUB AND THUMPED ON THE DOOR OF COURSE THE OLD BEE DID NOT ANSWER SUCH NONSENSE BUT WENT ON TO THE OTHERS FROM EVERY SIDE THEY WERE CALLING OUT FOR MORE FOOD AND THE LITTLE GRUB COULD HEAR IT ALL IT IS HARD THOUGH SHE THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO BE SO HUNGRY
BEFORE LONG THEIR TEETH WERE CHATTERING EEF AH CAN GET HEEM AWAY FROM DOOR
OR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE ASKED A POOR CRAWLING CREATURE LIKE ME TO BRING UP HER DAINTY LITTLE ONES MUCH THEY'LL MIND ME TRULY WHEN THEY FEEL THE GAY WINGS ON THEIR BACKS AND CAN FLY AWAY OUT OF MY SIGHT WHENEVER THEY CHOOSE
NOW THEY ARE LYING THERE ASLEEP SHE SAID AT LAST FROM MORNING TILL EVENING THEY DO NOTHING BUT EAT AND SLEEP AND THEY GROW BIGGER AND FATTER EVERY DAY IN A FEW DAYS THEY WILL BE FULL GROWN AND WILL CREEP OUT OF THEIR CELLS THEN MY TURN WILL BE OVER
AND HAD ALREADY MADE A SHOW OF A HOLE IN THE CABBAGE LEAF THEY HAD BROKEN FROM THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS SHAME AND AMAZEMENT FILLED OUR GREEN FRIEND'S HEART BUT JOY SOON FOLLOWED
AND THE CATERPILLAR TALKED ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE TO HER RELATIONS OF THE TIME WHEN SHE SHOULD BE A BUTTERFLY BUT NONE OF THEM BELIEVED HER SHE NEVERTHELESS HAD LEARNT THE LARK'S LESSON OF FAITH
BUT AT THE SAME MOMENT THE BEES SWARMED OUT FROM ALL DIRECTIONS SEIZED HER BY THE LEGS AND WINGS AND DRAGGED HER OUT WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE CRIED ARE YOU RAISING A REBELLION NO YOUR MAJESTY ANSWERED THE BEES WITH GREAT REVERENCE BUT WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE INTENDING TO KILL THE PRINCESSES
THEN I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE CRIED THE LARK FOR THE BEST OF MY NEWS REMAINS BEHIND YOU WILL ONE DAY BE A BUTTERFLY YOURSELF WRETCHED BIRD EXCLAIMED THE CATERPILLAR
THEY STOOD IN DIAGONALLY OPPOSITE CORNERS OF THE ROOM AND UPHELD THE HUGEST OF FEATHER BEDS WITH GAY HOME MADE WORSTED COVERLETS AND VALANCES THAT SHAMED THE HUES OF THE RAINBOW
FOR AS THE FIRST WONDER WAS POSSIBLE THE SECOND MIGHT BE SO TOO TEACH ME YOUR LESSON LARK SHE WOULD SAY AND THE LARK SANG TO HER OF THE WONDERS OF THE EARTH BELOW AND OF THE HEAVEN ABOVE
WE SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO HAVE KEPT THE OLD ONE BUT SHE MIGHT HAVE SPARED HERSELF THE REMARK FOR IN THE SAME MOMENT THE PRINCESSES GAVE EACH OTHER SUCH A STAB WITH THEIR STINGS THAT THEY BOTH FELL DEAD AS A DOOR NAIL
ALL ROUND NEW LITTLE BEECH TREES SHOT UP WHICH GREW JUST AS FAST AS THEIR PARENTS AND LOOKED AS GREEN AND AS HAPPY AS IF THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE WAS
JOHN HAD A SMALL AXE WITH WHICH TO SPLIT THE TIMBERS FOUR OLD NEWSPAPERS IN WHICH TO GATHER UP THE PRECIOUS DUST AND A BOTTLE IN WHICH TO PUT IT IT WAS THANKSGIVING MORNING THE SUN ROSE IN A CLEAR STRAW COLORED SKY
ABANDONING THE PROPERTY THE CLEARING WAS KNOWN TO ALL THE BOYS OF THE LOCALITY AS A FAVORITE HAUNT OF FOXES THE NEXT MORNING SAM'S YOUNGER BROTHER JOHN WILLIS MURCH AND I
IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GO FROM ONE FORE CASTLE MESS TO ANOTHER AND TO INSIST UPON HAVING RATHER MORE THAN HIS SHARE OF THE CHOICE MORSELS FROM EACH IN A SHORT TIME HE CAME TO THE REPAIR SHOP VERY MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR WITH AN IMPAIRED DIGESTION
WHICH APPEARED TO BE FAST DYING THE CAPTAIN AFTER SECURING THE END OF THE SEVERED WHALE LINE ATTACHED IT TO THE LINE IN THE THIRD OFFICER'S BOAT AND THEN TOLD ME TO GET INTO THE STOVEN BOAT
AND THE STORM BROKE THEM OFF AND CAST THEM ON THE GROUND THE OLD OAK HAD NOW ONLY A FEW LEAVES LEFT AT THE VERY TOP THE END IS NEAR HE SAID GRAVELY
MADE HIM ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OFFICERS IN THE WHOLE FLEET HE ENTERED INTO ALL OF THEIR SPORTS AND SYMPATHIZED WITH THE DISCOMFORTS OF FORECASTLE LIFE HE WAS FOND OF ANIMAL PETS AND ALWAYS WELCOMED THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW ONE
THE BRACES OF THAT BARN HAD BEEN MADE OF CLEFT RED OAK
AT LEAST TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT THE SHIPS WHICH HAD NOW CROSSED OUR WAKE HE ADDED BLAST THOSE NANTUCKETERS THEY CAN SMELL A SPERM WHALE FIVE MILES TO THEIR LEEWARD ANY TIME HE HAD COME DOWN FROM THE RIGGING AND ORDERED THE HEAD SAILS THROWN BACK
LET ME GO CRIED THE QUEEN AND TRIED TO GET AWAY I AM QUEEN NOW ANYWAY AND HAVE THE POWER TO DO WHAT I LIKE HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT I SHALL DIE IN THE AUTUMN BUT THE BEES HELD HER FAST AND DRAGGED HER OUTSIDE THE HIVE THERE THEY SET HER FREE
SOME OF THE OLD BEES WHO HAD BEEN GRUBS AT THE SAME TIME AS THE QUEEN DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD FOLLOW HER AND SOON AFTER THEY FLEW AWAY NOW WE HAVE NO QUEEN SAID THE OTHERS WE MUST TAKE GOOD CARE OF THE PRINCESSES
AFTER WAITING A FEW MOMENTS I VENTURED TO CRAWL FORWARD ON THE THWARTS AND FOUND THE WHALE LINE WAS STILL ATTACHED TO THE BOW I WENT BACK TO THE STERN AND SAT ON THE AFTER THWART THINKING OF THE GUN
BECAUSE OF THEIR LONG LEGS SLENDER BODIES AND GREAT CAPACITY FOR RUNNING AND RAZOR BACKS ON ACCOUNT OF THE PROMINENCE OF THE SPINAL COLUMN THE ORIGIN OF THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES OF THE PORCINE TRIBE IS UNKNOWN BUT THERE IS A TRADITION TO THE EFFECT
HE MUST BE VERY CLEVER AND KNOW A GREAT DEAL FOR TO GO UP VERY HIGH WHICH SHE COULD NEVER DO WAS THE CATERPILLAR'S IDEA OF PERFECT GLORY NOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING CORN FIELD THEIR LIVED A LARK
WITH PRICK EARS SPITTING AND SNARLING ON THE COVERLET CAN THAT BEAST CLIMB UP HERE LIKE A CAT HE ASKED WITH NO LITTLE ANXIETY IN HIS TONES OUI WAS THE REPLY HE CAN
YOU ARE WELCOME AMONG US SAID THE OLD OAK AND GRACIOUSLY INCLINED HIS HEAD TO THEM YOU SHALL BE MY FOSTER CHILDREN AND BE TREATED JUST AS WELL AS MY OWN THANKS SAID THE LITTLE BEECHES
THE HEAD BEE NURSE CAME RUNNING UP IN AN INSTANT AND OPENED THE DOORS WHAT ARE YOUR GRACES ORDERS SHE ASKED DROPPING A CURTSY AND SCRAPING THE GROUND WITH HER FEET MORE HONEY THEY SHOUTED ALL IN ONE VOICE BUT ME FIRST ME FIRST I AM THE ONE WHO IS TO BE QUEEN
THE ANIMAL BACKED DRAGGING THE QUARTER OF VENISON TOWARD THE DOOR HE COLLIDED WITH IT KNOCKING THE BILLET OF WOOD OUTSIDE AND THE LATCH FELL INTO PLACE WITH A CLASH FINDING HIMSELF A PRISONER
AND ALMOST WISHED THE WHALE WOULD COME BACK I DID NOT FEEL SO LONG FOR THE NEXT INSTANT THE BOAT BEGAN TO MOVE AGAIN I HEARD THE WHALES SPOUTING AND RIGHT ABREAST WAS A MONSTER SWIMMING STRAIGHT TOWARD THE BOAT
RAY GRINNED BUT MADE NO REPLY
WE ARE ALL OAK TREES THEY SAID WE OWN THE LAND AND RULE OVER IT AND THEY WERE RIGHT THERE WERE ONLY A FEW HUMAN BEINGS THERE IN THOSE DAYS AND THOSE THAT THERE WERE WERE NOTHING BETTER THAN WILD ANIMALS
THE BEECHES ONLY LAUGHED AND WENT ON GROWING AT LAST THEY CLOSED TOGETHER OVER THE LITTLE OAK'S HEAD AND THEN HE DIED THAT WAS A HORRID THING TO DO
PERHAPS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO INQUIRE AND HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT IT NEXT TIME YOU GO UP HIGH OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR TIMIDLY THE LARK SAID PERHAPS HE SHOULD BUT HE DID NOT SATISFY HER CURIOSITY ANY FURTHER
ONLY UNLIKE HOLGER HE DIDN'T GO TO SLEEP BUT PROCEEDED TO MAKE HIMSELF AT HOME SO HE MADE AN OPENING IN HIS UPPER SIDE AND RIGGED FOR HIMSELF A MOUTH AND A STOMACH AND PUT A WHOLE ROW OF FEELERS OUT
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DARED BUILD A FIRE IN THE BARN EVEN IF WE HAD HAD MATCHES WILLIS GROPED ABOUT IN THE OLD HAY BAY AND GATHERED A FEW HANDFULS OF MUSTY HAY
BUT THE PURSUIT DID NOT END THERE SEEING THAT THE BEAST WAS ABOUT TO LEAP UPON THE BED
AS I RAN TWO OR THREE DULL WHACKS CAME TO MY EAR GOT HIM TOM I SHOUTED RUSHING UP TOM WAS HOLDING AND SQUEEZING ONE OF HIS HANDS WITH THE OTHER AND SHAKING IT VIOLENTLY
THE KINGS OF THE WOOD DO NOT COME TILL THE WHOLE COMPANY IS ASSEMBLED BUT AT LAST THEY CAME ALL THE LEAVES BURST FORTH FROM THE SWOLLEN BUDS AND THE TREES LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND COMPLIMENTED ONE ANOTHER ON THEIR BEAUTY
THE BEES HAD THEM READY IN NO TIME AND THEN THE QUEEN LAID TEN PRETTY EGGS ONE IN EACH OF THE BIG ROOMS AND THE DOORS WERE FIXED AS BEFORE EVERY DAY THE BEES FLEW IN AND OUT GATHERING GREAT HEAPS OF HONEY AND FLOWER DUST BUT IN THE EVENING WHEN THEIR WORK WAS DONE
THE REST OF THE BOATS HAD EACH SECURED ANOTHER WHALE THE CREW IN THE THIRD OFFICER'S BOAT APPEARED TO BE MAKING SIGNALS OF DISTRESS AND CAPTAIN COFFIN ORDERED US TO CUT LOOSE FROM OUR WHALE AND GO QUICKLY TO THEIR ASSISTANCE
ONE DAY THE BEAR CAME TRUDGING ALONG AND LAY DOWN AT FULL BREADTH UNDER A GREAT OAK TREE ARE YOU THERE AGAIN YOU ROBBER SAID THE OAK AND SHOOK A LOT OF WITHERED LEAVES DOWN OVER HIM YOU SHOULD NOT SQUANDER YOUR LEAVES MY OLD FRIEND
MANY THANKS ANSWERED THE BEECHES WE CAN GROW VERY NICELY IN THE SHADE AND THE WHOLE SUMMER PASSED BY AND ANOTHER SUMMER AFTER THAT AND STILL MORE SUMMERS THE BEECHES WENT ON GROWING
TILL THE SNOW COVERED ALL THE ANIMALS AND THEN THE TREES AND THEN THE MOUNTAINS THEN IT WOULD THAW A LITTLE AND STREAMS OF WATER WOULD RUN OVER THE SNOW THEN IT WOULD FREEZE AGAIN AND PACK IT INTO SOLID ICE
WITH THE GUILE SO APT TO DEVELOP IN A BOY WHO HAS OLDER BROTHERS WHO TEASE HIM BUT WE DID SAID JOHN IF YOU TELL THEM I'LL LICK YOU EXCLAIMED WILLIS MAKE THEM BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN GUARDING THIS BEAR JOHN AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF SO GLARING A DECEPTION
EVERY ONE HAS HIS OWN MANNER OF GROWTH AND WE HAVE OURS ANSWERED THE YOUNG BEECHES THIS IS THE WAY IT'S DONE WHERE WE COME FROM AND WE ARE PERHAPS AS GOOD AS YOU ARE
THE SUN SHONE ON THEM AND THE RAIN FELL ON THEM SO IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY GREW TALL OH HOW PRETTY THEY ARE SAID THE GREAT OAK AND STOOPED HIS CROOKED BOUGHS STILL MORE SO THAT THEY COULD GET A GOOD VIEW OF THEM
TURNING TO THE THIRD OFFICER HE ADDED
FROM THE FRAMES OF OLD BUILDINGS WHEN OF OAK POWDER POST WILL SOMETIMES RUN IN STREAMS WHEN A BEAM OR BRACE IS STRUCK BUT EVERYTHING HAS ITS VIRTUES IF ONLY THEY CAN BE FOUND OUT AND LONG AGO IN NEW ENGLAND
WILLIS AND I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT HURRY THEN SAID WILLIS OR WE SHALL BE LATE TO THANKSGIVING DINNER I'M HUNGRY NOW WE RAN TO THE BARN THE LEAN TO DOOR WAS OFF ITS HINGES BUT WOODEN PINS HELD THE OAK BRACES OF THE FRAME IN POSITION WE KNOCKED OUT THE PINS
THE SWISH OF THE WATER AS IT RIPPLED BENEATH THE BOAT AND THE SCREECHING OF SEA FOWLS THAT HAD NOW GATHERED AROUND THE FLOATING CARCASS SET ME TO THINKING OF THE SHIP
I AM LORD IN THE LAND AND WHATEVER WAY YOU LOOK YOU FIND MY BROTHERS AND NOTHING ELSE TRUE MUTTERED THE BEAR THAT IS JUST WHAT IS SO SICKENING I HAVE BEEN FOR A LITTLE TOUR ABROAD I MAY TELL YOU AND AM JUST A LITTLE BIT SPOILT
SO I THINK REPLIED WILLIS STOPPING TO LOOK ABOUT I THINK WE'RE HEADING OFF TOO FAR TOWARD STOSS POND SAID I OH NO WE'RE NOT CRIED WILLIS COME ON
WITH THE NIMROD'S NAME STAMPED UPON IT TO THEIR CARCASSES THE REST OF THE SCHOOL HAD GONE DOWN AND THE THIRD AND FOURTH OFFICERS CREWS WERE RESTING ON THEIR OARS WAITING FOR THE ATTACKED WHALES TO BREAK WATER AGAIN THE OTHER SHIPS NOW HAD THEIR BOATS IN THE WATER
WITHOUT PAUSE OR REST BEARING HIS LADY BETWEEN HIS ARMS WHEN THE VARLET HEARD THIS CUNNING COUNSEL OF THE MAIDEN HE REJOICED GREATLY AND THANKING HER SWEETLY FOR HER REDE CRAVED PERMISSION TO DEPART
THE TOWN YET ENDURES WITH ITS TOWERS AND HOUSES TO BEAR WITNESS TO THE TRUTH MOREOVER THE COUNTRY THEREABOUTS IS KNOWN TO US ALL AS THE VALLEY OF PISTRES THIS KING HAD ONE FAIR DAUGHTER
SHE HELD HIM FOR A MONTH WITHIN HER CHAMBER BUT THIS WAS LESS FROM CHOICE THAN FOR THE CRAFT THAT WAS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THE INK AND PARCHMENT REQUISITE FOR HER WRITING AT THE END SHE WROTE A LETTER ACCORDING TO HER HEART AND SEALED IT WITH HER RING
NOW AGAINST THE FOUR LOVERS ARRAYED THEMSELVES FOUR OTHER KNIGHTS ARMED ALTOGETHER IN COATS OF MAIL AND HELMETS AND GAUNTLETS OF STEEL OF THESE STRANGER KNIGHTS TWO WERE OF HAINAULT AND THE TWO OTHERS WERE FLEMINGS
WHAT SHALL I DO FOR NEVER SHALL I KNOW HAPPINESS AGAIN THESE FOUR KNIGHTS HAD SET THEIR HEARTS UPON ME AND DESPITE THEIR GREAT TREASURE ESTEEMED MY LOVE AS RICHER THAN ALL THEIR WEALTH ALAS FOR THE FAIR AND VALIANT KNIGHT ALAS FOR THE LOYAL AND GENEROUS MAN
THEIR SON HANDSELLED THEM TOGETHER AND GAVE THE MOTHER TO HIS SIRE
HE CAUSED IT TO BE PROCLAIMED BOTH FAR AND NEAR BY SCRIPT AND TRUMPET THAT HE ALONE SHOULD WED THE MAID WHO WOULD BEAR HER IN HIS ARMS TO THE PINNACLE OF THE GREAT AND PERILOUS MOUNTAIN AND THAT WITHOUT REST OR STAY
AND RIGHT DESIROUS TO WIN THAT PRIZE WHICH WAS SO COVETED OF ALL HE WAS A WELCOME GUEST AT THE COURT AND THE KING TALKED WITH HIM VERY WILLINGLY THIS SQUIRE HAD SET HIS HEART UPON THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING
IN RETURN HIS SPEAR WAS AIMED WITH SUCH CUNNING THAT HE BORE HIS ANTAGONIST TO THE GROUND MILON LAY UPON THE EARTH BAREHEADED FOR HIS HELMET WAS UNLACED IN THE SHOCK
WHEN THE KNIGHT HEARD THESE WORDS HE MADE ANSWER VERY SWIFTLY LADY NAME IT NOT THE LAY OF THE FOUR SORROWS BUT RATHER THE LAY OF THE DOLOROUS KNIGHT WOULD YOU HEAR THE REASON WHY IT SHOULD BEAR THIS NAME
THE RANKS OF THE TWO COMPANIES WERE CONFUSED TOGETHER SO THAT EVERY MAN FOUGHT AGAINST HIS FELLOW
CHANGE THY RAIMENT SWIFTLY SAID HE AND HASTEN TO THE CASTLE OF MY FRIEND TAKE WITH THEE MY SWAN AND SEE THAT NONE NEITHER SERVANT NOR HANDMAID DELIVERS THE BIRD TO MY LADY SAVE THYSELF ALONE
ONLY THIS IS THERE TO DO TO GIVE THE SLAIN MEN SEEMLY BURIAL AND IF IT MAY BE TO HEAL THEIR COMRADE OF HIS WOUNDS SO BECAUSE OF HER GREAT LOVE AND NOBLENESS
AS FOR THE WOUNDED KNIGHT SHE COMMANDED HIM TO BE CARRIED TO HER OWN CHAMBER SHE SENT FOR SURGEONS AND GAVE HIM INTO THEIR HANDS THESE SEARCHED HIS WOUNDS SO SKILFULLY AND TENDED HIM WITH SO GREAT CARE THAT PRESENTLY HIS HURT COMMENCED TO HEAL
THE DAMSEL STOOD UPON A TOWER TO WATCH THESE FEATS OF ARMS BY THEIR BLAZONED COATS AND SHIELDS SHE KNEW HER KNIGHTS SHE SAW THEIR MARVELLOUS DEEDS YET MIGHT NOT SAY WHO DID BEST NOR GIVE TO ONE THE PRAISE BUT THE TOURNAMENT WAS NO LONGER A SEEMLY AND ORDERED BATTLE
OF YOUR CHARITY I PRAY YOU THAT I MAY HAVE SPEECH WITH MY FRIEND IN SUCH A FASHION THAT NONE SHALL KNOW OF OUR MEETING CARRY HER THIS MY GOLDEN RING TELL HER ON MY PART THAT SO SHE PLEASES SHE SHALL COME TO ME OR IF IT BE HER BETTER PLEASURE
HIS HAIR AND BEARD SHOWED WHITE TO ALL AND THE VARLET WAS HEAVY TO LOOK ON HIM WHOM HE HAD OVERTHROWN HE CAUGHT THE DESTRIER BY THE BRIDLE AND LED HIM BEFORE THE STRICKEN MAN SIR SAID HE I PRAY YOU TO GET UPON YOUR HORSE
MEN CAME TO LEARN THE ISSUE OF THIS THING BUT FOR HER PART THE FAIR MAIDEN DID ALL THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO BRING HER LOVE TO A GOOD END
THE LADY CAUSED THESE THREE DISTRESSFUL KNIGHTS TO BE BURIED WELL AND WORSHIPFULLY IN A RICH ABBEY IN THAT PLACE SHE OFFERED THEIR MASS PENNY AND GAVE RICH OFFERINGS OF SILVER AND OF LIGHTS BESIDES MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON THEM IN THAT DAY
WOULD NOT BE REFRESHED IN HEART AND BLOOD AND BONES SUCH VIRTUE HAD THIS MEDICINE DIRECTLY IT WERE DRUNKEN THIS SIMPLE SHE POURED WITHIN A LITTLE FLACKET
HE DETERMINED THEREFORE THAT HE WOULD LEAVE HIS COUNTRY AND SEEK ADVENTURE AS A KNIGHT ERRANT BEYOND THE SEA THE VARLET DELAYED NO LONGER THAN THE EVENING ON THE MORROW HE BADE FAREWELL TO HIS AUNT
FOR SHE WOULD NOT SLAY THREE LOVERS WITH HER HAND SO THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE CONTENT
SEVEN TIMES A DAY THEY REPOSED THEM IN THEIR JOURNEY SO THAT THE WOMEN MIGHT NOURISH THE BABE AND BATHE AND TEND HIM DULY THEY SERVED THEIR LORD SO FAITHFULLY KEEPING SUCH WATCH UPON THE WAY THAT AT THE LAST THEY WON TO THE LADY TO WHOM THEY WERE BIDDEN
THIS BEING ACCORDED BETWEEN THEM ON THE MORROW THEY MADE THEM READY FOR THE JOURNEY AND BIDDING FAREWELL TO THEIR FRIENDS SET FORTH FOR WALES THEY EMBARKED IN A PROPITIOUS HOUR FOR A FAIR WIND CARRIED THE SHIP RIGHT SWIFTLY TO ITS HAVEN
BRINGING THE FLACKET WITH HIM WHEN THE GREAT COMPANY WERE FULLY MET TOGETHER THE KING LED FORTH HIS DAUGHTER BEFORE THEM AND ALL MIGHT SEE THAT SHE WAS ARRAYED IN NOTHING BUT HER SMOCK THE VARLET TOOK THE MAIDEN IN HIS ARMS
WHERE HE SPENT HIS MONEY AND HIMSELF IN FEASTS AND IN TOURNEYS THE RICH MEN OF THE LAND WERE GLAD OF HIS FRIENDSHIP FOR THERE WAS NONE WHO BORE HIMSELF BETTER IN THE PRESS WITH SPEAR OR WITH SWORD
WHO HAVING WARNED AND ADMONISHED HIM FOR HIS GOOD GAVE HIM LARGELY OF HER WEALTH TO BRING HIM ON HIS WAY HE RODE TO SOUTHAMPTON THAT HE MIGHT FIND A SHIP EQUIPPED FOR SEA AND SO CAME TO BARFLEUR WITHOUT ANY TARRYING THE LAD WENT STRAIGHT TO BRITTANY
A PILLOW OF FEATHERS WAS PUT BENEATH HIS HEAD AND OVER ALL WAS LAID A WARM COVERLET WADDED WITH FUR IN THIS FASHION THE ANCIENT NURSE GAVE THE BABE TO HIS FATHER WHO AWAITED HIM WITHIN THE GARDEN
WAS BRUITED SO ABROAD THAT THE BRETONS MADE A SONG IN THEIR OWN TONGUE AND NAMED THIS SONG THE LAY OF THE TWO LOVERS IN NEUSTRIA THAT MEN CALL NORMANDY
HE INQUIRED DILIGENTLY OF THE YOUNG CHAMPION AND ALL MEN WERE READY TO TELL FROM WHENCE HE CAME AND OF HIS HARNESS AND OF THE BLAZON ON HIS SHIELD AT LENGTH THE KNIGHT APPEARED IN THE LISTS AND MILON LOOKED UPON THE ADVERSARY HE SO GREATLY DESIRED TO SEE
NEVER WAS LADY OF MY PEERAGE HOWEVER FAIR AND GOOD AND GRACIOUS EVER LOVED BY FOUR SUCH VALIANT GENTLEMEN NOR EVER LOST THEM IN ONE SINGLE DAY SAVE YOU WHO WERE SO MAIMED AND IN SUCH PERIL ALL ARE GONE
MILON OBSERVED HIM CURIOUSLY THE LAD STRUCK SO HEAVILY HE THRUST HOME SO SHREWDLY THAT MILON'S HATRED CHANGED TO ENVY AS HE WATCHED VERY COMELY SHOWED THE VARLET AND MUCH TO MILON'S MIND
I KNOW LITTLE OF MY FATHER I UNDERSTAND THAT HIS NAME IS MILON AND THAT HE WAS A KNIGHT OF WALES HE LOVED THE DAUGHTER OF A RICH MAN AND WAS LOVED AGAIN MY MOTHER BORE ME IN SECRET AND CAUSED ME TO BE CARRIED TO NORTHUMBERLAND WHERE I WAS TAUGHT AND TENDED
PERCHANCE I MAY FIND YOU COMFORT FAIR FRIEND REPLIED SHE
AND BE CALLED THE LAY OF THE DOLOROUS KNIGHT HE WHO WOULD NAME IT THE LAY OF THE FOUR SORROWS WOULD NAME IT WRONGLY AND NOT ACCORDING TO THE TRUTH BY MY FAITH REPLIED THE LADY THIS IS A FAIR SAYING
IF YOU COME WITH ME I WILL BRING YOU WHERE I MAY KNOW WHETHER IT PLEASES MY LADY TO HAVE SPEECH WITH YOU AND TO RECEIVE YOUR GIFT THE PORTER ENTERED IN THE HALL WHERE HE FOUND NONE BUT TWO LORDS SEATED AT A GREAT TABLE PLAYING CHESS FOR THEIR DELIGHT
BETTER BY FAR THAT A MAN PRAY AND REQUIRE IN LOVE ALL THE DAMES OF HIS COUNTRY THAN RUN MAD IN WOODS FOR THE BRIGHT EYES OF ONE THEREFORE THIS DAME GAVE COURTESY
YET IN THE END ALTOGETHER DISTRAUGHT BY LOVE THIS PRUDENT VARLET SOUGHT HIS FRIEND AND SHOWED HER HIS CASE SAYING THAT HE URGENTLY REQUIRED OF HER THAT SHE WOULD FLEE WITH HIM FOR NO LONGER COULD HE ENDURE THE WEARINESS OF HIS DAYS
HE SWIFTLY RETURNED ON HIS STEPS AND THE FOWLER WITH HIM SO FURTIVELY WITHAL THAT THE LORDS WERE NOT DISTURBED AT THEIR GAME NOR PERCEIVED AUGHT OF THE MATTER THEY WENT THEREFORE TO THE CHAMBER OF THE LADY
EVEN WHEN SHE MIGHT NOT HEAR A LOVER'S WORDS SO SWEETLY SHE DENIED HIS WISH THAT THE MORE HE HELD HER DEAR AND WAS THE MORE HER SERVANT FOR THAT FOND DENIAL SO BECAUSE OF HER GREAT RICHES OF BODY AND OF HEART THIS LADY OF WHOM I TELL
THE LADY CAUSED THE SWAN TO FAST FOR THREE FULL DAYS THEN HAVING CONCEALED THE MESSAGE ABOUT HIS NECK LET HIM TAKE HIS FLIGHT THE BIRD WAS ALL ANHUNGERED FOR FOOD AND REMEMBERING WELL THE HOME FROM WHICH HE DREW HE RETURNED THITHER AS QUICKLY AS HIS WINGS MIGHT BEAR HIM
SHE REQUIRED HER FRIEND TO COME FOR SPEECH WITHIN THE PRIVATE GARDEN OF HER HOUSE WHERE SHE WAS WONT TO TAKE HER DELIGHT MILON CAME AT HER COMMANDMENT HE CAME SO OFTEN AND SO DEARLY SHE LOVED HIM THAT IN THE END SHE GAVE HIM ALL THAT MAID MAY GIVE
THIS WONDROUS BIRD I WOULD BESTOW FORTHWITH UPON YOUR LADY BUT PERFORCE I MUST OFFER HER THE GIFT WITH MY OWN HAND FRIEND REPLIED THE PORTER FOWLERS ARE NOT ALWAYS WELCOMED OF LADIES
AND SINCE FEW WORDS ARE BEST I WILL SET OUT THE ADVENTURE AS BRIEFLY AS I MAY MILON WAS BORN IN SOUTH WALES
BUT FIRST HE GAVE HER THE FLASK WITH THE PRECIOUS BREWAGE TO CARRY SINCE FOR PRIDE HE MIGHT NOT ENDURE TO DRINK THEREFROM SAVE AT UTMOST PERIL THE SQUIRE SET FORTH AT A GREAT PACE AND CLIMBED BRISKLY TILL HE WAS HALFWAY UP THE MOUNT
AND HER HUSBAND TOOK HER TO DWELL WITH HIM IN HIS FIEF WHEN MILON RETURNED TO HIS OWN COUNTRY HE WAS RIGHT HEAVY AND SORROWFUL TO LEARN OF THIS MARRIAGE HE LAMENTED HIS WRETCHED CASE BUT IN THIS HE FOUND COMFORT
MILON WENT FORTH FROM HIS REALM TO SERVE BEYOND THE SEAS FOR GUERDON HIS FRIEND REMAINED WITHIN HER HOUSE AND WAS GRANTED BY HER FATHER IN MARRIAGE TO A RIGHT RICH BARON OF THAT COUNTRY
BUT FREEING THEIR FEET FROM THE STIRRUPS BENT OVER THE FALLEN FOE AND CALLED ON HIM TO YIELD WHEN THE FRIENDS OF THE VANQUISHED KNIGHTS SAW THEIR CASE THEY HASTENED TO THEIR SUCCOUR SO FOR THEIR RESCUE THERE WAS A GREAT PRESS AND MANY A MIGHTY STROKE WITH THE SWORD
THE LAY OF MILON HE WHO WOULD TELL DIVERS TALES MUST KNOW HOW TO VARY THE TUNE TO WIN THE FAVOUR OF ANY HE MUST SPEAK TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF ALL I PURPOSE IN THIS PLACE TO SHOW YOU THE STORY OF MILON
PASSING NONE BY BIDDING THEM TO SEE THE END OF THIS ADVENTURE YEA WITH PUBLIC CRY AND SOUND OF TRUMPET HE BADE ALL WHO WOULD COME TO BEHOLD THE STRIPLING CARRY HIS FAIR DAUGHTER TO THE PINNACLE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND FROM EVERY REGION ROUND ABOUT
SO LONG AS I CAN HOLD UPON MY WAY IT IS THE NOISE OF ALL THIS FOLK THE TUMULT AND THE SHOUTING THAT MAKES MY STEPS UNCERTAIN THEIR CRIES DISTRESS ME I DO NOT DARE TO STAND BUT WHEN TWO THIRDS OF THE COURSE WAS WON
SO SHALL THE SONG BE KNOWN AS THE LAY OF THE DOLOROUS KNIGHT THUS WAS THE LAY CONCEIVED MADE PERFECT AND BROUGHT TO A FAIR BIRTH FOR THIS REASON IT CAME BY ITS NAME THOUGH TO THIS DAY SOME CALL IT THE LAY OF THE FOUR SORROWS
CONTEMNERS OF LOVE WHO DELIGHT THEMSELVES IN SADNESS BUT ENDURE IT I MUST FOR ALAS I KNOW NOT HOW TO DIE SO ON THE APPOINTED DAY THE LADY WAS WEDDED TO THE BARON
THE SWAN IS FIT TO SERVE AT A ROYAL TABLE FOR THE BIRD IS PLUMP AS HE IS FAIR THE VARLET PUT THE SWAN IN HIS LADY'S HANDS SHE TOOK THE BIRD KINDLY AND SMOOTHING HIS HEAD AND NECK FELT THE LETTER THAT WAS HIDDEN BENEATH ITS FEATHERS
THE LADY RECEIVED THEM COURTEOUSLY AS BECAME HER BREEDING SHE BROKE THE SEAL OF THE LETTER AND WHEN SHE WAS ASSURED OF WHAT WAS THEREIN MARVELLOUSLY SHE CHERISHED THE INFANT THESE HAVING BESTOWED THE BOY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR LORD'S COMMANDMENT RETURNED TO THEIR OWN LAND
FOR HER PART THE LADY WAS SORE PERPLEXED AND CONSIDERED IN HER MIND VERY EARNESTLY WHICH OF THESE FOUR KNIGHTS SHE SHOULD TAKE AS FRIEND
FOR THIS IS NOT TO MY HEART HEARKEN WELL I HAVE KINDRED IN SALERNO OF RICH ESTATE FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS MY AUNT HAS STUDIED THERE THE ART OF MEDICINE AND KNOWS THE SECRET GIFT OF EVERY ROOT AND HERB IF YOU HASTEN TO HER
SHE BROKE THE SEAL AND UNFASTENING THE LETTER CAME UPON THE NAME OF MILON AT THE HEAD SHE KISSED THE NAME A HUNDRED TIMES THROUGH HER TEARS WHEN SHE MIGHT READ THE WRITING SHE LEARNED OF THE GREAT PAIN AND DOLOUR THAT HER LOVER SUFFERED BY DAY AND BY NIGHT
PROMISING FOR HIS PART THAT WERE SHE GIVEN HIM HE WOULD BEAR HER IN HIS ARMS TO THE SUMMIT OF THE MOUNT THE KING WAS NO WISE WRATH AT HIS PRESUMPTION HE SMILED RATHER AT HIS FOLLY
THEY HAD NOT RIDDEN FAR UPON THEIR ROAD WHEN THEY MET A CERTAIN SQUIRE OF THE LADY'S HOUSEHOLD ON HIS WAY TO BRITTANY BEARING LETTERS TO MILON HIS TASK WAS DONE LONG BEFORE SUNDOWN IN CHANCING ON THE KNIGHT
FOR IN THIS FASHION DIED A DAME WHO WAS FAIR AND SWEET AND GRACIOUS BEYOND THE WONT OF THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN NOW THE KING AND HIS COMPANY SINCE THESE TWO LOVERS CAME NOT AGAIN PRESENTLY CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN TO LEARN THEIR END
EVER WAS IT FAST DAY AND FLESHLESS DAY WITH HER SO THAT BY ANY MEANS SHE MIGHT LIGHTEN THE BURTHEN THAT HER FRIEND MUST CARRY IN HIS ARMS NOW ON THE APPOINTED DAY THIS YOUNG DANSELLON CAME VERY EARLY TO THE APPOINTED PLACE
THE FOUR BODIES WERE FALLEN ON THE FIELD AND LAY WITH THOSE WHO HAD PERISHED IN THAT DAY BUT BECAUSE OF THE GREAT MISCHIEF THESE FOUR LOVERS HAD DONE THEIR ADVERSARIES THEIR SHIELDS WERE CAST DESPITEFULLY WITHOUT THE LISTS BUT IN THIS THEIR FOEMEN DID WRONGFULLY
THE SQUIRE DID ACCORDING TO HIS LORD'S COMMANDMENT HE MADE HIM READY QUICKLY AND WENT FORTH BEARING THE SWAN WITH HIM HE WENT BY THE NEAREST ROAD AND PASSING THROUGH THE STREETS OF THE CITY CAME BEFORE THE PORTAL OF THE CASTLE
BUT MUST LOVE ME AS A SON AND EVER HOLD ME DEAR WHEN MILON HEARD THESE WORDS HE COULD ENDURE THEM NO FURTHER HE GOT HIM SWIFTLY FROM HIS HORSE AND TAKING THE LAD BY THE FRINGE OF HIS HAUBERK HE CRIED PRAISE BE TO GOD FOR NOW AM I HEALED
ALAS SAID THE LADY WHAT SHALL I DO I DOUBT THAT I AM LOST FOR MY LORD WILL FIND THAT HIS BRIDE IS NOT A MAID IF THIS BECOMES KNOWN THEY WILL MAKE ME A BONDWOMAN FOR ALL MY DAYS
HE MADE INQUIRY OF THE LAD FRIEND SAID HE HEARKEN TO ME TELL ME NOW THE NAME OF THY SIRE HOW ART THOU CALLED WHO IS THY MOTHER I HAVE SEEN MUCH AND GONE TO AND FRO ABOUT THE WORLD
NOR WAS THE CHIVALRY OF NANTES BACKWARD IN THIS QUARREL BUT TILL THE VESPERS OF THE TOURNAMENT WAS COME THEY STAYED THEMSELVES WITHIN THE LISTS AND STRUCK STOUTLY FOR THEIR LORD AFTER THE FOUR LOVERS HAD LACED THEIR HARNESS UPON THEM
MANY A TIME THE SWAN WENT UPON HIS JOURNEY FOR HOWEVER STRICTLY THE LADY WAS HELD OF HER HUSBAND THERE WAS NONE WHO HAD SUSPICION OF A BIRD THE DAME BEYOND THE HUMBER NOURISHED AND TENDED THE BOY COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE WITH THE GREATEST CARE
THIS MESSAGE HE MADE FAST TO THE NECK AND HID WITHIN THE PLUMAGE OF A SWAN THAT WAS LONG HIS AND WAS GREATLY TO HIS HEART HE BADE HIS SQUIRE TO COME AND MADE HIM HIS MESSENGER
WHO RECEIVED THE GIFT WITH GREAT JOY AND DELIGHT AND RETURNED SWIFTLY TO HIS OWN LAND THE VARLET MADE NO LONG SOJOURN IN HIS HOME HE REPAIRED STRAIGHTWAY TO THE COURT AND SEEKING OUT THE KING REQUIRED OF HIM HIS FAIR DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
SO DEBONAIR WAS HE AND CHIVALROUS THAT HIS FAME AND PRAISE CROSSED THE WATER AND WERE NOISED ABROAD IN HIS OWN LAND FOLK TOLD HOW A CERTAIN KNIGHT FROM BEYOND THE HUMBER WHO HAD PASSED THE SEA IN QUEST OF WEALTH AND HONOUR HAD SO DONE
VERY DOLENT WAS HE AND SORELY TROUBLED THAT SO YOUNG A KNIGHT SHOULD BE ESTEEMED ABOVE HIS FATHERS HE MARVELLED GREATLY THAT THE STOUT SPEARS OF THE PAST HAD NOT PUT ON THEIR HARNESS AND BROKEN A LANCE FOR THEIR ANCIENT HONOUR ONE THING HE DETERMINED
THE LAY OF THE DOLOROUS KNIGHT MY HARPER CALLED HIS SONG BUT OF THOSE WHO HEARKENED SOME NAMED IT RATHER THE LAY OF THE FOUR SORROWS IN NANTES OF BRITTANY
THEN RETURN TO THIS REALM WITH YOUR POTION AND ASK ME AT MY FATHER'S HAND HE WILL DEEM YOU BUT A STRIPLING AND SET FORTH THE TERMS OF HIS BARGAIN THAT TO HIM ALONE SHALL I BE GIVEN WHO KNOWS HOW TO CLIMB THE PERILOUS MOUNTAIN
GIFTS SHE GAVE TO ALL ALIKE TENDER MESSAGES SHE SENT TO EACH EVERY KNIGHT DEEMED HIMSELF ESTEEMED AND FAVOURED ABOVE HIS FELLOWS AND BY SOFT WORDS AND FAIR SERVICE
AND BY THE COUNSEL OF ALL MEN LAID THEM SOFTLY TO REST ON THAT MOUNTAIN WHERE THEY DIED THEN THEY DEPARTED FROM THEM AND LEFT THEM TOGETHER ALONE
NEVERTHELESS BY REASON OF HIS SKILL WITH THE SPEAR HE WAS COUNTED A VERY WORSHIPFUL KNIGHT AND WAS HONOURABLY ENTREATED BY MANY A PRINCE IN DIVERS LANDS IN MILON'S OWN REALM THERE LIVED A LORD WHOSE NAME HAS GONE FROM MIND
AND FOR LOVE OF HER PAINED HIMSELF MIGHTILY AND DID ALL THAT HE WAS ABLE SO THAT BY ANY MEANS HE MIGHT GAIN HER FAVOUR EACH PRAYED HER PRIVILY FOR HER LOVE AND STROVE ALL THAT HE COULD TO MAKE HIM WORTHY OF THE GIFT ABOVE HIS FELLOWS
THAT BY REASON OF HIS PROWESS HIS LIBERALITY AND HIS MODESTY MEN CALLED HIM THE KNIGHT PEERLESS SINCE THEY DID NOT KNOW HIS NAME THIS PRAISE OF THE GOOD KNIGHT AND OF HIS DEEDS CAME TO BE HEARD OF MILON
MEETLY TO MOURN THE DEAD THERE RODE NIGH UPON TWO THOUSAND KNIGHTS WITH HAUBERKS UNLACED AND UNCOVERED HEADS PLUCKING UPON THEIR BEARDS SO THE FOUR LOVERS WERE PLACED EACH UPON HIS SHIELD AND BEING BROUGHT BACK IN HONOUR TO NANTES
FROM THE NET WHEREIN THEY WERE TAKEN BUT I FIND MY LIFE MORE BITTER THAN MY COMRADES FOUND THE GRAVE I SEE YOU ON YOUR GOINGS AND COMINGS ABOUT THE HOUSE I MAY SPEAK WITH YOU BOTH MATINS AND VESPERS
FAIR FRIEND BY MY FAITH THOU ART MY VERY SON FOR WHOM I CAME FORTH FROM MY OWN LAND AND HAVE SOUGHT THROUGH ALL THIS REALM THE VARLET CLIMBED FROM THE SADDLE AND STOOD UPON HIS FEET FATHER AND SON KISSED EACH OTHER TENDERLY WITH MANY COMFORTABLE WORDS
OF COURSE YOU KNOW THIS GAME AND YOU KNOW THE DIFFICULTY OF THINKING OF A PROVERB WHICH HAS NO MOSS OR STABLE DOORS OR GLASSHOUSES IN IT ALL OF THEM WORDS WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO INCLUDE NATURALLY IN AN ANSWER TO AN ORDINARY QUESTION
A BRITTLE ONE WHICH EXPLODED JUST AS HE WAS GETTING INTO IT
AND DOWN CAME BILLY FOLLOWED BY THE BRIGADIER WE JUMPED UP YOU'LL HAVE A DRINK SIR SAID BILLY OH THANKS VERY MUCH WHAT WILL YOU HAVE SIR ASKED BLAKE
I SAID AFTER HE'D TOLD ME SOME OF IT THAT NICE CHILD IN D COMPANY WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM DIDN'T YOU HEAR

BUT I KEEP ON MAKING IT EIGHT AND TUPPENCE JUST HAVE A SHOT AT IT THERE'S A GOOD FELLOW I PROMISED THE GIRL YOU KNOW I SAT DOWN WORKED IT OUT HASTILY ON THE BACK OF AN ENVELOPE AND MADE IT A YARD AND A HALF
BUT I COULDN'T GET MY MIND OFF HERBERT'S WRETCHED PROBLEM HAPPENING TO SEE CAREY AT TEATIME I MENTIONED IT TO HIM AH SAID CAREY PROFOUNDLY
HOWEVER AS IT HAPPENED I HAD SOMETHING WHICH I WANTED TO SAY
BUT I KNOW NOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROSPECTS OF THE SEASON OR AT ANY RATE OF THE FIRST WEEK OF IT ARE
I SUDDENLY BECAME NERVOUS ABOUT ALGERNON I COULD NOT TAKE HIM RED AND UNDRAPED PAST THE HALL PORTER PAST ALL THE OTHER RESIDENTS WHO MIGHT SPRING OUT AT ME ON THE STAIRS ACCORDINGLY I PLACED THE BLOCK OF ICE ON THE SEAT
BIT SHE SAID REMOVING FRAGMENTS OF SHELL FROM HER LAP
AS SOON AS I ARRIVED AND THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BOWL TO ME HOW LONG ARE YOU STAYING TILL TO NIGHT I SAID QUICKLY ROT YOU'RE FIXED UP HERE TILL TUESDAY ANY HOW MY DEAR DICK I'VE COME DOWN FOR A FEW DAYS REST
OUR HOSTESS HAD LAST AND MISSUS PETER HAD THAT ALL THIS BEING SETTLED OUR HOST WAS ADMITTED INTO HIS SMOKING ROOM AGAIN YOU BEGIN WITH ME I SAID AND I WAS PROMPTLY ASKED
OF THE PROSPECTS OF JOAN I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN ABOVE THERE REMAIN ONLY THE PROSPECTS OF MYSELF WHICH ARE FRANKLY ROTTEN THEY CONSIST CHIEFLY OF TWO HOURS BOWLING TO THE BATTING OF DICK
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY IT MYSELF THEN IN THAT CASE I HAVE THE HONOUR TO RESIGN THE MESS PRESIDENCY
AND THE AMOUNT OF LIME JUICE CONSUMED BY CASUAL VISITORS I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
I ARRIVED EXHAUSTED AND WITH ONLY JUST STRENGTH ENOUGH TO KNEEL DOWN AND PRESS MY FOREHEAD AGAINST THE LARGE BLOCK OF ICE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP ROUND WHICH THE LOBSTERS NESTLED HERE YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT SAID THE FISHMONGER WAVING ME AWAY
AND I TELEGRAPHED AN APPEAL TO CELIA FOR HELP SHE NODDED BACK AT ME HAVE YOU FINISHED ASKED OUR HOST GOOD LORD NO I SHALL BE HALF AN HOUR YET THE FACT IS YOU'VE ASKED THE WRONG QUESTION YOU SEE I'VE GOT TO GET IN MOSS
FIFTEEN FIFTEEN NOW WHY SHOULD THE OFFICER COMMANDING THE FIFTEENTH PLATOON RIDE A HORSE WHEN THE OFFICER COMMANDING THE NINETEENTH HE REMINDED ME THAT THERE WERE ONLY SIXTEEN PLATOONS IN A BATTALION
WOULD SHE NOT BE EXPECTING HIM TO TURN UP AT EVERY COURSE THINK OF THE LONG DRAWN OUT DISAPPOINTMENT FOR HER NOT EVEN LOBSTER SAUCE THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE I DECIDED TO ABANDON THE ICE
HE WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS BROW HE ER THAT IS TO SAY ER LLOYD GEORGE YES IS THAT THE ANSWER SAID OUR HOST RATHER SURPRISED HERBERT EXPLAINED HASTILY THAT HE HADN'T REALLY BEGUN YET
I SAID THINKING HARD ALL THE TIME YOU WOULD WELL PUT IT THIS WAY THE RANGE OF A MILLS BOMB IS ABOUT FIFTY YARDS THE RANGE OF A FIELD TELEPHONE IS SEVERAL MILES
FROM THE SHOPMAN HE WOULDN'T MIND BESIDES IF HE SAW US TOGETHER HE'D PROBABLY KNOW YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF A GOLDSMITH ARE YOU
I WONDER IF YOU COULD LET ME HAVE A LITTLE PIECE OF YOUR ICE I VENTURED
OH THANKS VERY MUCH I SAID AND I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE STEP IT WOULD BE RATHER I THINK PERHAPS WELL THANKS VERY MUCH ONCE BEGUN THE BOOK FILLED UP RAPIDLY
IDEAL BOWLING AND IN ADDITION THE WHOLE HEARTED ADMIRATION OF ALL OF US IN SHORT THE OUTLOOK HERE IS DISTINCTLY HOPEFUL PHYLLIS THE PROSPECTS OF THIS PLAYER ARE FROM HER OWN POINT OF VIEW BRIGHT
I HAVE NEVER BEEN QUITE CERTAIN THEY HAD DONE THEIR CALISTHENICS SIDE BY SIDE THEY HAD COMPARED PICTURE POST CARDS OF LEWIS WALLER
I PUT THE BLOCK OF ICE DOWN ON THE PAVEMENT UNWRAPPED THE LOBSTER PUT THE LOBSTER NEXT TO THE ICE SPREAD ITS DAILY MAIL OUT
FLUNG ME THE REINS AND SAID
SAID BOBBY I BET PHYLLIS CAN BOWL BETTER THAN YOU IS THIS TRUE I SAID TO PHYLLIS
I DOUBT IF EVEN IN ENGLAND WHICH SEEMS VERY FAR OFF YOU WILL FIND TWO PEOPLE MORE CONTENTED WITH THE MORNING THAN TOBY AND I
SLOW THAT IS YOU KNOW WHEN I DO BOWL AT ALL I'M NOT QUITE SURE THIS SEASON WHETHER I HADN'T BETTER SLOW SAID DICK THOUGHTFULLY THAT'S REALLY WHAT I WANT
EMERGED FROM HIS APOLOGIES AND SWORE THAT HE WAS
THE POSSIBILITY OF GETTING HIS HEAD DEFINITELY SMACKED FORTUNATELY IT IS MY ONLY CONSOLATION THE SEASON WILL BE A SHORT ONE
IN THE SMALL SPACE ALLOTTED TO HIM THE SCULPTOR HAS HARDLY DONE ME JUSTICE AND THERE I ADDED IS HIS INITIAL R OH WOMAN THE AMOUNT OF THOUGHT I SPENT ON THAT RING
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WITHOUT A TREMOR BUT OF COURSE YOU SHALL PUT JUST WHATEVER YOU LIKE ONLY ONLY LET IT BE ORIGINAL NOT MIZPAHS RIGHT I SAID
I HAD THE HONOUR OF OPENING IT I HAPPENED TO BE MENDING A TELEPHONE LINE IN THIS PARTICULAR TRENCH ONE THIRSTY DAY AND THERE WAS THE DUG OUT AND WELL THERE WAS I
I SAID SHARPLY YOU'RE MIXING UP SHOOTING AND HUNTING MY LAD AND IN ANY CASE THERE ARE REASONS SPECIAL REASONS WHY I RIDE TOBY REASONS OF WHICH YOU KNOW NOTHING HERE ARE THE REASONS
TO AVOID BEING SHOT WELL ANYHOW THEY RESIGN I SHALL SEND MY RESIGNATION IN TO THE ARMY COUNCIL TO NIGHT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE GAZETTE IN DUE COURSE
BUT HE HAD BEEN KNEE DEEP IN MUD INSPECTING HUTS FOR NEARLY HALF AN HOUR AND WAS SICK OF BILLETING I NEED NOT DESCRIBE TWO HUNDRED LORRIES ON A DARK EVENING TO YOU AND SO SEEING THAT YOU KNOW THE CONSTITUENTS
WELL THERE YOU ARE SAID CELIA TRIUMPHANTLY LET'S PLAY PROVERBS I DON'T THINK I KNOW IT SAID HERBERT HE WOULDN'T OH IT'S QUITE EASY FIRST YOU THINK OF A PROVERB LIKE
I'M EVER SO MUCH OLDER NOW TALKING ABOUT WEDDING RINGS SHE WENT ON AS SHE TWISTED HER OWN ROUND AND ROUND SHE'S GOT ALL SORTS OF THINGS WRITTEN INSIDE HERS THE DATE AND THEIR INITIALS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SUMMER EVENINGS WITH THE CHILL ON SO AFTER DINNER WE LIT THE SMOKING ROOM FIRE AND WONDERED WHAT TO DO THERE WERE EIGHT OF US JUST THE RIGHT NUMBER FOR TWO BRIDGE TABLES OR FOUR PICQUET PAIRS
THE PROVERBS WHICH MISSUS HERBERT SUGGESTED WERE FULL OF MOSS WHAT ABOUT IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO MEND SAID MISSUS PETER THE ONLY DIFFICULT WORD IS MEND
I HESITATED I ER WELL LADIES OFTEN LIKE THE DATE PUT IN WHEN IS IT TO BE
AH THAT'S RIGHT THE ANSWER IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MEN NO THAT'S WRONG I NEVER DOUBLED THE HALF CROWN ER OH LOOK HERE HERBERT I'M RATHER BUSY THIS MORNING I'LL SEND IT TO YOU
I GOT UP SLIGHTLY REFRESHED I WANT I SAID SOME AND THEN A THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME AFTER ALL DID FISHMONGERS SELL ICE PROBABLY THE LARGE BLOCK IN FRONT OF ME WAS JUST A TRADE SIGN
I LOVE YOU I REPEATED MECHANICALLY I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I WELL LOOK HERE PERHAPS I'D BETTER GO BACK AND GET THE RING ON THE NEXT DAY I WAS THERE AGAIN BUT THERE WAS A DIFFERENT MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER
PETER AND HIS WIFE WHO KNEW THE GAME AGREED MISSUS HERBERT SEEMED RESIGNED TO THE WORST BUT HERBERT THOUGH FAINT WAS STILL PURSUING BUT DOESN'T HE GUESS WHAT THE PROVERB IS HE ASKED
SOMETIMES I ADMITTED BUT SOMETIMES IF WE ARE VERY VERY CLEVER HE DOESN'T THAT IN FACT IS THE GAME OUR HOST GOT UP AND WENT TO THE DOOR I THINK I SEE HE SAID
NOT THAT THAT OFTEN HAPPENS I ADDED LOOK HERE
AND AN ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY LOBSTER I WAS NOT GOING TO WASTE STILL MORE MONEY IN TAXIS HOT THOUGH IT WAS I WOULD WALK FOR SOME MILES ALL WENT WELL THEN THE ICE BEGAN TO DRIP THROUGH THE PAPER AND IN A LITTLE WHILE
THERE CAN'T BE MUCH ELSE UNLESS PERHAPS SHE HAS A VERY LARGE FINGER WELL I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING IN MINE SAID CELIA MOURNFULLY SHE TOOK OFF THE OFFENDING RING AND GAVE IT TO ME
I THOUGHT IT WAS CAMELS SAID CELIA CARELESSLY NO MOSS NOW IF YOU'D ONLY ASKED ME A QUESTION ABOUT GARDENING YOU SEE THE PROVERB WE WANTED TO HAVE FIRST OF ALL WAS
NOT WHEN YOU GET A GRAND SLAM SAID OUR HOST THINKING OF AN ACCIDENT WHICH HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE EVEN THEN I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYBODY LAUGHED PETER AND I WHO WERE PARTNERS ON THAT OCCASION ADMITTED THAT WE HADN'T LAUGHED
THIS HADN'T OCCURRED TO ME I LET IT SINK IN OF COURSE I SAID AT LAST ONE MUST CONSIDER ONE'S HORSE I QUITE SEE THAT WITH A BICYCLE
ON THE OTHER HAND SOME OF HIS BEST PLANTS WILL BE DISTURBED WHILE THERE IS MORE THAN A CHANCE THAT HE MAY LOSE THE SERVICES OF A LIBRARY WINDOW MISSUS MALLORY THE PROSPECTS HERE ARE MUCH AS LAST YEAR
DO HAVE A SHOT AT IT THE ANSWER OUGHT TO BE EIGHT MILES AN HOUR LUCKILY HOWEVER SHE FORGOT TO ENCLOSE THE PROBLEM FOR BY THIS TIME WHAT WITH HERBERT'S SUBALTERN CAREY'S PAWN
AS SHE WILL BE ALLOWED TO FIELD FOR TWO HOURS A DAY TO THE BELOVED DICK SHE IS ALSO FULLY QUALIFIED NOW TO HELP WITH THE HEAVY ROLLER
A WEDDING RING ENGRAVED AND I FELT IN MY POCKETS NOT INITIALS I SAID AND I FELT IN SOME MORE POCKETS BUT BUT I TRIED THE TROUSERS POCKETS AGAIN WELL LOOK HERE I'LL BE QUITE FRANK WITH YOU
SIXPENNYWORTH I SAID FEELING SUDDENLY THAT CELIA'S THREEPENNYWORTH SOUNDED RATHER PALTRY
THAT IS ALL I SAID FAINTLY AND WITH ALGERNON THE OVERWHISKERED CRUSTACEAN FIRMLY CLUTCHED IN THE RIGHT HAND AND STONEHENGE SUPPORTED ON THE PALM OF THE LEFT HAND I RETIRED THE FLAT SEEMED A VERY LONG WAY AWAY
THAT WOULD BE A LOVELY THING SHE SAID CLASPING HER HANDS EAGERLY WHAT I LOVE YOU CELIA I LOOKED AT HER AGHAST DO YOU WANT ME TO ORDER THAT IN COLD BLOOD
IT IS RATHER A SHAME I AGREED BUT I CAN ALWAYS REFUSE OH BUT YOU MUSTN'T WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY ICE AND THE THOMPSONS ARE COMING TO DINNER
AND A DISTANCE EQUAL TO THE DISTANCE IT WOULD HAVE TRAVELLED IF IT HAD BEEN GOING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION WHAT WAS THE CAPTAIN'S NAME PERHAPS I HAVE NOT GOT IT QUITE RIGHT FOR I HAVE HAD AN EVENTFUL WEEK SINCE THEN
IS THAT IF YOU CAN'T RUN ANY MESS IN THE TRENCHES ON FOUR FRANCS A DAY YOU'RE A ROTTEN MESS PRESIDENT BLAKE TURNED DRAMATICALLY TO HIS COMPANY COMMANDER DID YOU HEAR THAT BILLY
WE MIGHT TRY IT SAID CELIA DOUBTFULLY NOT FEELING QUITE SURE IF IT WERE A REAL PROVERB BUT COMETH WOULD BE DIFFICULT I DON'T SEE WHY SAID HERBERT ONE COULD ALWAYS WORK IT IN SOMEHOW
AND IF THERE IS A SPARE HORSE OVER WHAT ABOUT THE BOMBING OFFICER SAID O C PLATOON FIFTEEN CARELESSLY I HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THE BOMBING OFFICER OF COURSE HE IS A SPECIALIST TOO
AS MAN OF THE WORLD SAID BLAKE STRETCHING HIMSELF TO HIS FULL HEIGHT OF FIVE FOOT THREE AND SPEAKING WITH THE WISDOM OF NINETEEN YEARS I SAY THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE
IN ANY OTHER COMPANY CERTAINLY AT HEADQUARTERS POSSIBLY BUT NOT IN D COMPANY D COMPANY HAS A REPUTATION ALL I SAY SAID ROGERS
I DROPPED IN HALLO SAID BLAKE HAVE A DRINK I HAD A LIME JUICE THEN I HAD ANOTHER AND THEN
AND A CISTERN LEFT ME BY AN UNCLE WHO WAS DINING WITH US THAT NIGHT I HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TO DISTRACT ME AND SO THE BUSINESS HAS GONE ON
I WROTE PLEASANTLY ENTERTAINED AS USUAL BY D COMPANY REFUSED A PRESSING INVITATION TO STAY TO LUNCH ALTHOUGH IT WAS A HOT DAY AND I HAD A LONG WALK BACK TO MY OWN MESS
I SAY NOTHING OF THE RESULT BUT FOR REASONS CONNECTED WITH TOBY I HOPE HE WON'T COME AGAIN FOR IN THE MIDDLE OF A NARROW STREET CROWDED WITH LORRIES HE JUMPED OFF HIS HORSE FLUNG I THINK THAT'S THE EXPRESSION
MISSUS HERBERT REPEATED HER HUSBAND'S TRIUMPH WITH THE AND THEN IT WAS MY TURN AGAIN FOR THESE HORRIBLE CAMELS MY ONLY HOPE WAS THAT OUR HOST WOULD ASK ME IF I HAD BEEN TO THE ZOO LATELY BUT I DIDN'T SEE WHY HE SHOULD
THE GENERAL LOOKED INQUIRING AND STARTED FEELING FOR HIS GLASSES HE WAS JUST FEELING IN HIS FIFTH POCKET WHEN BILLY CAME TO THE RESCUE IT'S ONLY SOME NONSENSE OF BLAKE'S SIR HE SAID
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING I COULD THINK OF THE ENGRAVED RING ARRIVED AS WE WERE AT TEA A FEW DAYS LATER AND I HAD A SUDDEN OVERWHELMING FEAR THAT CELIA WOULD NOT BE PLEASED
R BLAKE D S O BRIG GEN I HAD BEEN OUT OF IT FOR A LONG TIME AND WHEN QUITE ACCIDENTALLY I MET AN OFFICER OF THE BATTALION IN LONDON I WAS NEARLY A YEAR BEHIND THE NEWS AND BLAKE
THE SEASON'S PROSPECTS THE GREAT QUESTION IN THE MALLORY FAMILY JUST NOW IS WHETHER DICK WILL GET INTO THE ELEVEN THIS YEAR CONFIDENT AS HE IS HIMSELF HE IS TAKING NO RISKS WE'RE GOING TO PUT THE NET UP TO MORROW HE SAID TO ME
TILL WEDNESDAY ANYHOW I INTERRUPTED THINKING IT A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO CLINCH THE MATTER WE GENERALLY STAY EXPLAINED CELIA UNTIL OUR HOST BREAKS IT TO US THAT HE CAN'T STICK US ANY LONGER
AND SO THE BRISTLES CAME AND REMAINED UNTIL THE HAPPY DAY WHEN THE WAR OFFICE AT THE RISK OF LOSING THE WAR MADE THEM OPTIONAL IMMEDIATELY THEY WERE UPROOTED
CHESTNUTS ROANS BAY RUMS I KNOW NOTHING OF ALL THESE I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE A HORSE SIMPLY AS A NICE HORSE OR A NASTY HORSE TOBY IS A NICE HORSE
HE SAID A MOUSTACHE SUITS YOU MY WIFE DOESN'T THINK SO I SAID FIRMLY I HAD THE WAR OFFICE ON MY SIDE SO I COULD AFFORD TO BE FIRM THE COLONEL LOOKED AT ME
THE PROSPECTS HERE ARE ON THE WHOLE ENCOURAGING TO DWELL UPON THE BRIGHT SIDE FIRST THERE WILL BE HALF AN HOUR'S CASUAL BOWLING AND AN HOUR AND A HALF'S MISCELLANEOUS COACHING EVERY DAY
AND WOULD DO IT PROPERLY THIS TIME I WANT THREE OF ICE I SAID WITH AN AIR
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN BOWL SAID BOBBY RUDELY BOBBY IS TWELVE FIVE YEARS YOUNGER THAN DICK IT IS NOT MY PLACE TO SMACK BOBBY'S HEAD BUT SOMEBODY MIGHT DO IT FOR HIM
I FUMBLED IN MY TICKET POCKET I WANT I LOVE YOU ON IT AND I WENT THROUGH THE WAISTCOAT POCKETS A THIRD TIME I ER LOVE YOU ME SAID THE SHOPMAN SURPRISED
WHATEVER'S THE MATTER DON'T YOU THINK HE'D DO IT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE CHEEK TO ASK HIM GOOD LORD
WHICH SEEMED TO BREAK THE SPELL SOMEHOW
IF IT REALLY MEANS THAT SHE TOOK THE RING IN HER HANDS AND LOOKED AT IT LOVINGLY AND WHAT'S THAT THERE SORT OF A MAN'S HEAD I GAZED AT HER SADLY YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE IT
WHICH OF US IS MORE LIKELY TO REQUIRE A HORSE AND THE SNIPING OFFICER HE WENT ON DREAMILY THIS ANNOYED ME YOU DON'T SHOOT SNIPE FROM HORSEBACK
WHICH NOW SEEMED SO FAR AWAY HER FATHER HAD AGAIN AND AGAIN POINTED IT OUT TO THE CHILD AND TAUGHT HER TO BE PROUD OF IT AND MORE THAN ONCE HER CHILDISH EYE HAD BEEN CAUGHT
SINCE NO ONE COULD HAVE REASONABLY EXPECTED THAT AN APPARENTLY SOUND MAN OF SIXTY WOULD HAVE SUCCUMBED IN THREE DAYS
FLANKED ON EITHER SIDE BY GROUPS OF OLD TREES
CAN'T YOU AS JIM DON'T WANT TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WESTALL THANK YOU KINDLY ALL THE SAME SHE ADDED BREAKING OFF HER NARRATIVE WITH THE SAME UNCERTAINTY OF MANNER THE SAME TIMID SCRUTINY OF HER VISITOR THAT MARCELLA HAD NOTICED BEFORE
WALKED OFF WITH THEM AND MENDED THEM ALL WHEN LOUIS CAME HOME HE DISCOVERED A NEAT HEAP REPOSING ON HIS TABLE OF COURSE HE WEPT WHATEVER HE MAY SAY BUT NEXT MORNING
SHE SOON DISCOVERED OR IMAGINED THAT HURD HAD MORE EDUCATION THAN HIS NEIGHBOURS AT ANY RATE HE WOULD SIT LISTENING TO HER AND SMOKING AS SHE MADE HIM DO WHILE SHE TALKED POLITICS AND SOCIALISM TO HIM
AND AS HER EYES STEEPED THEMSELVES
SAID MISSUS JELLISON SHARPLY TO HER AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A CHILD OF TEN THAT YOU DON'T SAY GOOD EVENIN TO THE YOUNG LADY MISSUS WESTALL CURTSIED LOW AND HOPED SHE MIGHT BE EXCUSED AS IT HAD GROWN SO DARK
AND AS SHE LOOKED
HE USED TO WALK OUT WITH ME OF A SUNDAY JUST AS CIVIL AS COULD BE
OR DID IT BETRAY PERHAPS A WOMAN'S SECRET CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOME PRESENCE BESIDE HER MORE TROUBLING AND MAGNETIC TO HER THAN OTHERS WELL THEN FRIDAY SAID WHARTON AT LAST WHEN HIS TIME WAS MORE THAN SPENT
MARCELLA TURNED ROUND AND MET THE FLASH OF HER MOTHER'S EYES I COULDN'T HELP IT SHE SAID IN A LOW HURRIED VOICE IT SEEMED SO HORRID TO FEEL EVERYBODY STANDING ALOOF WE WERE WALKING TOGETHER
AN SETTIN HIS FATHER AGAINST ANY OF EM AS DIDN'T GIVE IN TO HIM
THERE WAS A SOUND OUTSIDE MISSUS HURD FLEW TO THE DOOR AND A SHORT DEFORMED MAN WITH A LARGE HEAD AND RED HAIR STUMBLED IN BLINDLY SPLASHED WITH MUD UP TO HIS WAIST AND EVIDENTLY SPENT WITH LONG WALKING
WITH DESIGNS ON THE HEAD KEEPER'S POST WHENEVER IT MIGHT BE VACANT IN THE CASE OF A POACHER HE HAD THE SCENT OF ONE OF HIS OWN HARES IT WAS KNOWN TO HIM IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT TIME THAT THAT LOW CASELTY FELLOW HURD
ONE DAY SHE HEARD HIM IMPLORING THE LITTLE SLAVEY TO PUT SOME BUTTONS ON HIS SHIRTS THE SLAVEY TOSSED HER HEAD AND SAID SHE'D SEE ABOUT IT WHEN HE'D GONE OUT ANNA CAME DOWNSTAIRS CALMLY DEMANDED HIS SHIRTS AND HAVING THE SLAVEY UNDER HER THUMB GOT THEM
MEANWHILE IN THE LANE OUTSIDE MARCELLA AS SHE WALKED HOME PASSED A TALL BROAD SHOULDERED MAN IN A VELVETEEN SUIT AND GAITERS HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND TWO DOGS BEHIND HIM
THE QUARTER OF AN HOUR THAT FOLLOWED WENT AGREEABLY ENOUGH WHARTON SAT AMONG THE LITTLE GROUP FAR TOO CLEVER TO PATRONISE A CAT LET ALONE A VENTURIST BUT NONE THE LESS MASTER AND CONSCIOUS MASTER OF THE OCCASION
IF HE CHOSE TO BE EXPANSIVE IT WAS NOT FOR CRAVEN TO TAKE NO NOTICE CRAVEN HOWEVER EXCEPT IN PRINT WHERE HE COULD BE AS VEHEMENT AS ANYBODY ELSE NEVER SPOKE BUT IN THE DRIEST WAY OF THOSE WORKMAN'S GRIEVANCES WHICH IN REALITY BURNT AT THE MAN'S HEART
ABUNDANCE OF CURLY UNMANAGEABLE HAIR WHEREOF THE BRUSHING AND TENDING SOON BECAME TO A NERVOUS CLUMSY CHILD
MISSUS ELLERTON'S PONY CARRIAGE MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO PASS ALONG THAT ROAD
THROUGH ONE INFLUENCE AND ANOTHER
COVETOUS EAGERNESS IT WAS BUT THREE MONTHS OR SO SINCE MARCELLA'S FATHER MISTER RICHARD BOYCE HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE OWNERSHIP OF MELLOR PARK
OF GAMES LITTLE FRIENDS AND BIRTHDAY PARTIES
THE DEPENDENT OF THAT CHARLATAN I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M TO PUT UP WITH IT YOU KNOW VERY WELL WHAT I THINK OF HIM AND OF YOUR BECOMING DEPENDENT ON HIM MARCELLA GAVE AN ANGRY START LOUIS PROTESTED NONSENSE
SETTING HER PAST SELF AGAINST HER PRESENT MORE CONSCIOUSLY
STANDING BLACK AGAINST THE SKY BEYOND THE LAWN STRETCHED A GREEN DESCENT INDEFINITELY LONG
BUT HIS MOTHER SHE WAS A QUEER MAD BODY WITH RED HAIR JUST LIKE JIM AND THE CHILDREN AND A TEMPER MY WORD THEY DO SAY SHE WAS AN IRISH GIRL OUT OF A GANG AS USED TO WORK NEAR HERE AN SHE LET HIM DROP ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS IN LIQUOR
ARISTOCRATIC RELATIONS THEN WHEN THE PRINCESS HAD HELD OUT A GRACIOUS HAND AND SMILED ALL WAS DELIGHT MARCELLA GREW UP ON THE INSTANT
THE YOUNG LADIES CONCERNED EVIDENTLY FELT THEMSELVES VERY MUCH AT HOME
MISSUS HURD SAID WONDERING
HE BE MISS
THEN HE TOLD HIS FATHER AND NEXT MORNING HE TOLD ME AS HE COULDN'T STAND IT NO LONGER AN HE NEVER WENT BACK NO MORE AND HE TOLD NO ONE ELSE HE NEVER COMPLAINED ASKED MARCELLA INDIGNANTLY
AND LOUIS CRAVEN HAD ACCEPTED IMMEDIATE EMPLOYMENT ON THE LABOUR CLARION AS THE PAPER'S CORRESPONDENT IN THE MIDLANDS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE IMPORTANT STRIKE JUST PENDING
ONE OF THE WORST PLAGUES OF HER EXISTENCE
THE WHOLE OF HER FIRST YEAR WAS ONE CONTINUAL SERIES OF SULKS QUARRELS AND REVOLTS
IT ALSO LEFT DEEP MARK A TALL CONSUMPTIVE GIRL AMONG THE CLIFF HOUSE PUPILS
PUTTING DOWN A CUP AND LOOKING AT HIM IT'S THE THOUGHT OF THAT MAKES ME COLD IN MY BACK
BUT IN SPITE OF HIM IT TRANSFORMED EVERY LINE OF THE PINCHED AND WORN FACE AND YOU AND ANNA WILL WALK TO THE REGISTRY OFFICE NEXT WEEK SAID ANTHONY SOURLY AS HE TOOK HIS TEA
TURNING THEM OVER IN A SMILING EXCITEMENT
BUT FOR HERSELF IT RAISED HER TO ANOTHER PLANE OF EXISTENCE GAVE HER NEW OBJECTS AND NEW STANDARDS
CLIFF RISING IN TERRACES BEHIND IT AND ALONGSIDE IT
YOU'RE GOIN TO PUT THAT BIT OF HARE ON WELL MAK EEASTE DO FOR I'M STARVIN WHAT DID SHE WANT TO STAY ALL THAT TIME FOR YOU GO AND GET IT I'LL BLOW THE FIRE UP DAMN THESE STICKS
RELATIVELY TO THEIR PRESENT POSITION AT LEAST SHE WAS NO LONGER THE SELF CONSCIOUS SCHOOLGIRL
PRODUCING IN APPEARANCE AND MANNER A GENERAL IMPRESSION OF THIN GRACE AND OF A COURTESY WHICH WAS APT TO PASS UNACCOUNTABLY INTO SARCASM WHARTON HAD NEVER FELT HIMSELF PERSONALLY AT EASE WITH HIM
HE CARRIED HIM IN TO THE FIRE AND SAT HIM ON HIS KNEES THE LITTLE EMACIATED CREATURE FLUSHED WITH THE PLEASURE OF HIS FATHER'S COMPANY PLAYED CONTENTEDLY IN THE INTERVALS OF COUGHING WITH THE SHINING CHESTNUTS OR ATE HIS SLICE OF THE FINE PEAR
OH THANK YOU THANK YOU KINDLY MISS SAID MISSUS HURD RAISING HER APRON TO HER EYES TO STAUNCH SOME IRREPRESSIBLE TEARS AS MARCELLA SHOWED HER THE ADVERTISEMENT WHICH IT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE WORTH HURD'S WHILE TO ANSWER
WILL YOU COME IN AT ONCE DAISY NELLIE TWO LITTLE FIGURES CAME PATTERING UP THE STREET IN THE MOIST OCTOBER DUSK A THIRD PANTED BEHIND THE GIRLS RAN IN TO THEIR MOTHER CHATTERING AND LAUGHING
SHE WAS NOT HELD STRICTLY TO LESSON HOURS
HE MUST NEEDS GO ON TO THOSE WOODS OF LORD MAXWELL'S WHICH GIRDLED THE MELLOR ESTATE ON THREE SIDES AND HERE HE CAME ONCE MORE ACROSS HIS ENEMY FOR GEORGE WESTALL WAS NOW IN THE FAR BETTER PAID SERVICE OF THE COURT AND A VERY CLEVER KEEPER
FOR THOUGH SHE HAD HER MOVEMENTS OF FIERCE REVOLT
WHO CAME TO SEEM TO HER BEFORE LONG
SHE HATED GETTING UP IN THE WINTRY DARK AND HER COLD
THE BOYCES AND IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN SIX WEEKS SINCE MARCELLA HAD RECEIVED HER SUMMONS HOME FROM THE STUDENTS BOARDING HOUSE IN KENSINGTON WHERE SHE HAD BEEN LATELY LIVING
ALIVE WITH EXPECTATION
IT IS TO BE FEARED OR ANY WISH TO BE GOOD BUT ONLY AN ACHING INMOST SENSE OF CHILDISH LONELINESS AND HELPLESSNESS
EITHER NOW OR IN THE OLD DAYS OF VENTURIST DEBATES CERTAINLY WE SHALL FIGHT IT THROUGH WHARTON REPLIED WITH EMPHASIS I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE SECRETARY'S STATEMENT WHICH I NOW HAND OVER TO YOU
ANY LETTERS SHE ASKED NO BUT THERE ARE SOME CARDS OH YES THERE IS A NOTE AND SHE POUNCED UPON AN ENVELOPE SHE HAD OVERLOOKED IT IS FOR YOU MOTHER
SO SHE SUBMITTED AND PRESENTLY LEARNT UNDER DIRE STRESS OF BOREDOM TO AMUSE HERSELF A GOOD DEAL BY DEVELOPING A NATURAL CAPACITY FOR DREAMING AWAKE
IN THIS IMPRESSION WITH AVIDITY YET AT THE SAME MOMENT SHE NOTICED INVOLUNTARILY THE GATELESS GAP AT THE END OF THE AVENUE THE CHOKED CONDITION OF THE GARDEN PATHS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE LAWN
INCE'S OUTLINES OF ENGLISH HISTORY
UGLY ROOMS THE DISCIPLINE THE TEACHING THE COMPANIONSHIP OF MISS
OF THAT BEAUTIFUL ALEXANDRA THE TOP AND MODEL OF ENGLISH SOCIETY WHOSE PORTRAIT IN THE WINDOW OF THE LITTLE
MARCELLA'S LIFTED EYEBROWS ASKED FOR EXPLANATIONS SHE HAD NOT YET SEEN LOUIS'S BETROTHED BUT SHE WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE A CHARACTER AND A BETTER AUTHORITY ON MANY LABOUR QUESTIONS THAN HE
AND TAKING UP A BIT OF HALF BURNT WOOD WHICH LAY ON THE HEARTH HE THREW IT VIOLENTLY BACK INTO THE GRATE MARCELLA LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER WITH SURPRISE MISSUS HURD'S EXPRESSION WAS ONE OF MISERABLE DISCOMFORT
WOULD GO THE MUSIC STOOL AND THE CHILD LEAPT TO THE WINDOW REMAINING FIXED THERE
FOR SOME FOURTEEN HOURS THEREFORE ON THESE DAYS OF
TALL FOR HER AGE AND ENDOWED
THE BURDEN OF QUICK COMING CHILDREN THE BAD SANITARY CONDITIONS OF THEIR WRETCHED COTTAGE AND POOR HEALTH HAD MADE THEIR LIVES ONE LONG AND SORDID STRUGGLE BUT FOR YEARS HE HAD BORNE HIS LOAD WITH EXTRAORDINARY PATIENCE HE AND HIS COULD JUST EXIST
THINKING OF ALDOUS RAEBURN'S WORDS AND EXPRESSION AS HE BENT TO HER AT THE GATE I KNOW THEY DO AND IF WE CAN'T HOLD OUR HEADS HIGH BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THINGS IN THE PAST OUGHT WE TO BE SO PROUD
THE NOSTRILS WORKING SHOWED HER THAT HE WOULD BE GLAD WHEN SHE WENT AWAY HER YOUNG EXACTING TEMPER WAS PIQUED SHE HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME TRYING TO ARRANGE THEIR LIVES FOR THEM SO IN SPITE OF HIS DUMB RESISTANCE SHE LINGERED ON
PLEASE REMEMBER IT ANTHONY LOOKED AT HER AN INSTANT IN SILENCE A QUESTION CROSSED HIS MIND CONCERNING HER
THREE DAYS PASSED ON THE FOURTH MARCELLA RETURNED LATE IN THE AFTERNOON FROM A ROUND OF PARISH VISITS WITH MARY HARDEN AS SHE OPENED THE OAK DOORS WHICH SHUT OFF THE CENTRAL HALL OF MELLOR FROM THE OUTER VESTIBULE
THROWING THE SENNA TEA IN MARTHA'S FACE AND RUSHING DOWNSTAIRS IN HER NIGHTGOWN
AND TOLD HERSELF TO BE CHEERFUL BUT IT WAS HARD SHE WAS FAR BETTER BORN AND BETTER EDUCATED THAN HER HUSBAND HER FATHER HAD BEEN A SMALL MASTER CHAIR MAKER IN WYCOMBE AND HER MOTHER
NEVERTHELESS AS SHE SADLY CAME AND WENT PREPARING THE SUPPER SHE SAW THAT HE WAS APPEASED IN A BETTER TEMPER THAN BEFORE WHAT DID YOU TELL ER HE ASKED ABRUPTLY
AND FELL INTO A CHAIR BY THE GRATE HE HAD HARDLY GREETED MARCELLA WHO HAD CERTAINLY LOOKED TO BE GREETED EVER SINCE HER ARRIVAL IN AUGUST AS SHE HAD TOLD ALDOUS RAEBURN SHE HAD TAKEN A WARM INTEREST IN THIS MAN
AND OF PEACE WITH HER WHICH HE STILL FELT FAR AS CERTAIN NEW HABITS WERE BEGINNING TO SWEEP HIM FROM HER IT'S WESTALL OR JENKINS JENKINS WAS THE VILLAGE POLICEMAN HAVIN THE LAW ON YER JIM SHE SAID WITH EMPHASIS
RECTOR WAS A CALAMITY HARDLY TO BE BORNE IF THE EXIT OF THE SCHOOL PARTY WERE DELAYED BY ANY ACCIDENT SO THAT MISTER AND MISSUS ELLERTON OVERTOOK THEM IN THE CHURCHYARD
AND HAD OFFERED TWO HUNDRED A YEAR SO FAR AS THAT WENT CRAVEN WAS ABUNDANTLY SATISFIED AND I UNDERSTAND FROM YOU HE SAID THAT THE PAPER GOES IN FOR THE STRIKE THAT YOU WILL FIGHT IT THROUGH
MARCELLA HAD BETTER GO ON WITH HER STUDIES AS LONG AS POSSIBLE
SAID ANTHONY DOGGEDLY YOU'LL HAVE TO BEAR IT FROM ME I TELL YOU UNLESS YOU MUZZLE ME TOO WITH AN ANNA BUT I DON'T SEE WHY I SHOULD BEAR IT SAID MARCELLA TURNING UPON HIM I THINK YOU KNOW THAT I OWE MISTER WHARTON A DEBT
SHE THREW DOWN HER APRON WITH A GESTURE OF DESPAIR AS SHE STOOD BESIDE HIM IN FRONT OF THE FIRE WATCHING THE PAN WHAT AM I TO DO JIM AN THEM CHILLEN WHEN YOU'RE TOOK TO PRISON SHE ASKED HIM VEHEMENTLY I SHAN'T GET TOOK TO PRISON I TELL YER
DOZEN OTHERS IN THE COMFORTLESS LAVATORY SHE HATED THE MEALS IN THE LONG SCHOOLROOM WHERE BECAUSE TWICE MEAT WAS FORBIDDEN AND TWICE PUDDING ALLOWED
NINE TO FOURTEEN AND WHERE
BUT THE FEAT HAD EXHAUSTED HER SO MUCH THAT HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO INSIST ON TWO OR THREE DAYS RESPITE BEFORE MOVING ON TO SHIRTS
DREAMS MARCELLA HAD NO FAIRY TALES
AND REPLENISHED THE TEA POT THEN WITH A DELICATE HANDKERCHIEF SHE RUBBED AWAY A SPOT FROM THE HANDLE OF A SPOON NEAR HER YOU SHALL GO SHE SAID PRESENTLY YOU WISH IT THEN GO GO BY ALL MEANS
AND THAT THESE DAYS IN BED REPRESENTED CRISES WHICH MUST BE BORNE WITH
THERE WAS A BEDROOM AN INTERMEDIATE DRESSING ROOM AND THEN A LITTLE SITTING ROOM BUILT OUT UPON THE TERRACE WITH A WINDOW DOOR
SUCCEEDED BY ANOTHER PRECISE AS THE FIRST WAS
SHE HAD THE AIR OF PROTECTING AND GUIDING THIS POVERTY THAT COULD NOT HELP ITSELF THE MOTHER AND WIFE FELT HERSELF SHY INTIMIDATED THE TEARS CAME BACK TO HER BROWN EYES WHEN MISS BOYCE HAD GONE
LEANING AGAINST THE BARE SHELVES WHICH HELD THEIR FEW POTS AND PANS SHE THREW HER APRON OVER HER HEAD AND BURST INTO THE FORLORNEST WEEPING I WISH I WAS DEAD I WISH I WAS DEAD AN THE CHILLEN TOO
ENVIOUS TO REMEMBER FOR AT TWENTY ONE PEOPLE WHO TAKE INTEREST IN MANY THINGS AND ARE IN A HURRY TO HAVE OPINIONS
AND HIS FAMILY THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THEM WHICH MARKED THEM OUT A BIT FROM THEIR FELLOWS WHETHER IT WAS THE HUSBAND'S STRANGE BUT NOT REPULSIVE DEFORMITY CONTRASTED WITH THE TOUCH OF PLAINTIVE GRACE IN THE WIFE
TRYING WITH SHORTSIGHTED EYES TO DISTINGUISH HER DAUGHTER AMONG THE SHADOWS OF THE GREAT BARE PLACE A DARK DAY WAS DRAWING TO ITS CLOSE
SHE WAS NOT A FAVOURITE WITH HER COMPANIONS AND SHE WAS A PERPETUAL DIFFICULTY
MISTER RAEBURN MISS RAEBURN LADY WINTERBOURNE
WAS ATTACKING HIS GAME HURD NOTWITHSTANDING WAS CUNNING ITSELF AND WESTALL LAY IN WAIT FOR HIM IN VAIN MEANWHILE ALL THE OLD HATRED BETWEEN THE TWO MEN REVIVED
I WILL WRITE TO MISS RAEBURN AND SEND YOU OVER IN THE CARRIAGE ONE CAN PUT A GREAT DEAL ON HEALTH MINE IS QUITE SERVICEABLE IN THE WAY OF EXCUSES
AND THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN IN YOUTH THE LONELY VICTIM OF HIS NEIGHBOURS SCORN HAD FOUND A WOMAN TO GIVE HIM ALL HERSELF AND CHILDREN TO LOVE HENCE YEARS OF SUBMISSION A HIDDEN FLOWERING TIME FOR BOTH OF THEM TILL THAT LAST AWFUL WINTER
AND PROPPING HER FACE UPON HER HANDS DEVOURED THE SCENE
HE'LL TRY YOU MAY BE SURE BUT I CAN'T THINK AS HOW ANYTHINK ULL COME OV IT AND THEN SUDDENLY AS THOUGH SOMETHING UNEXPLAINED HAD UPSET HER SELF CONTROL THE POOR PATIENT CREATURE UTTERLY BROKE DOWN
ON THE STRANGE CELTIC FACE AND MATTED HAIR OF THE DWARF FAMILY AFFECTION AND THE SATISFACTION OF THE SIMPLER PHYSICAL NEEDS THESE THINGS MAKE THE HAPPINESS OF THE POOR FOR THIS HOUR TO NIGHT
SEEMLY AND PLEASANT THINGS OF A HOUSE IN LONDON OF A LARGE AND BRIGHT NURSERY OF A SMILING MOTHER WHO TOOK
GENERALLY OF WHITE MUSLIN WITH CHERRY COLOURED RIBBONS SHE WENT HERE AND THERE WITH THE PRINCESS LAUGHING AND TALKING QUITE CALMLY WITH THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN THE LAND
BUT MINTA WAS SORE AFRAID AND WENT ON TALKING AND LAMENTING WHILE SHE MADE THE TEA HE TOOK LITTLE HEED OF HER HE SAT BY THE FIRE QUIVERING AND THINKING
WHAT THINGS HE ASKED THOSE YOU WERE READING ABOUT GREEK AREN'T THEY OH THE GREEK ROOM
AND ADVANCED TO THE GIRL WHO SAT IN AN OLD WICKER CHAIR BEFORE THE FIRE
BESOUGHT JOSEPH TO PLUCK THE CHERRIES FOR HER BABE AND JOSEPH REFUSED AND THE VOICES OF THE SINGERS THAT HAD BEGUN HESITATINGLY GREW STRONG AND LOUD AND FREE
HE TOO MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN IN HIS THOUSANDS AT THE CLOSE OF ANY DAY
BUT THERE YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW DO YOU I TELL YOU D'YOU HEAR YOU'RE NOT TO RUN AT ALL WHEN I'M ABOUT
HE WAS BREATHING VERY QUICK AND SHORT WHY WHAT AILS YOU I DEMANDED STOPPING
THE GIPSY SAT SUDDENLY ERECT IT IS NOT SO KEEP STILL IN YOUR CHAIR SHE ORDERED AND I WILL TELL YOU WHEN IT WAS A CURIOUS THING THAT FOLLOWED
MIGHT HAVE DONE I GRUNTED WELL IN THAT CASE WE'LL GO AND GET IT IF ONE TRIED THE RESTAURANT FIRST RANGON SUGGESTED SMILING AGAIN
NO HARM WAS IT WE TUMBLED INTO BED BUT FOR ALL THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR I WASN'T SLEEPY SO FROM MY OWN BAG I TOOK A BOOK SET THE CANDLE ON THE END OF THE MANTEL AND BEGAN TO READ
AT AUNT RACHEL MOTHER THE GIPSY WOMAN WOULDN'T GO WITHOUT HER LITTLE BABY WOULD SHE NO SHE WOULDN'T DO THAT THEN HAS SHE LENT IT TO AUNT RACHEL LIKE I LEND MY NEW TOYS SOMETIMES
SHE MEANS AUNT RACHEL TEACH ME TO LIVE THAT I MAY DREAD THE GRAVE AS LITTLE AS MY BED SABRINA THE ELDEST INTERPRETED AH BUT WON'T YOU PLAY AT CHEERFUL THINGS DEARS
WE HAD KNOCKED OFF FOR THE DAY AND I WAS WALKING IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BRIDGE WHEN HE CAME UP WE WALKED ALONG TOGETHER AND
HOWEVER IN HIS SECRET HEART WHETHER MARSDEN HAD CHANGED VERY MUCH IN THAT RESPECT AFTER ALL MARSDEN GAVE A SHORT HONK OF A LAUGH YOU DIDN'T SUPPOSE I HADN'T CHANGED DID YOU THEN HE LEANED SUDDENLY FORWARD
ITS INSIDE WAS ENTIRELY NEW ITS CHEAP GLITTERING WALL MIRRORS THAT GAVE A FALSE IMPRESSION OF THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE PLACE ITS LOVES AND SHEPHERDESSES PAINTED IN THE STYLE OF THE CARTS OF THE VENDORS OF ICE CREAM
ROMARIN DID NOT RECOGNISE HIM WHEN HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE STREET AND WALKED TOWARDS HIM HE HADN'T MADE UP HIS MIND BEFOREHAND EXACTLY HOW HE HAD EXPECTED MARSDEN TO LOOK
AND THE WINTRY EASTERN LIGHT BEYOND THE CHIMNEY HOODS SEEMED SUDDENLY ALMOST TO DIE OUT BESSIE
DROP IT HE SAID SLOWLY NO LET'S GO ON
IF IT HADN'T BEEN PROVENCE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE ELSE I SUPPOSE NEARLY IF NOT QUITE AS GOOD BUT THIS WAS PROVENCE THAT SMELLS AS YOU MIGHT SAY OF TWENTY FOUR AS IT SMELLS OF ARGELASSE AND WILD LAVENDER AND BROOM
BROWN TITUS N NOW SHE'S GOING TO BE BURIED IN A GRAVE AS LITTLE AS HER BED IN A WHAT DEAR AS LITTLE DREAD AS LITTLE AS MY BED YOU SAY IT SABRINA
WHERE HE LIVED WITH HIS MOTHER HE SPOKE NO ENGLISH
AUNT RACHEL HAD BEEN AWAKENED FOR THE CONCLUSION OF FLORA'S FUNERAL BUT HER EYES WERE CLOSED AGAIN NOW AND ONCE MORE HER CHEEK WAS DROPPED IN THAT TENDER SUGGESTIVE LITTLE GESTURE AND SHE ROCKED
LIKE WHEN YOU NOD OFF TO SLEEP IN A CHAIR AND JERK UP AWAKE AGAIN AND AWAY HE WENT BUT NOW IT'S GETTING GRINDING SLUGGISH AND THE PAIN
A TINKLING NOISE WE PUT OUR CAPS ON A CARVED AND GILT CONSOLE TABLE
IT HAPPENED THAT THEY HAD PITCHED IN AS ONE OF THE FOREMEN SOME FELLOW OR OTHER
COME YOU'RE SHAKING
HE GASPED PRESENTLY TURNING A GHASTLY GRIN ON ME
BUT SUDDENLY I DARTED FORWARD SOMETHING NEW AND BRIGHT ON THE TABLE TWINKLED WITH THE LIGHT OF CARROLL'S MATCH THE MATCH WENT OUT AND BY THE TIME CARROLL HAD LIGHTED ANOTHER I HAD STOPPED I WANTED RANGON TO SEE WHAT WAS ON THE TABLE
TO LOOK OVER THE MUD SPLASHED HOARDING INTO THE GREAT EXCAVATION WE'D MADE IT WAS A SIGHT STAGING ROSE ON STAGING TIER ON TIER WITH INTERMINABLE LADDERS ALL OVER THE STEEL STRUCTURE THREE OR FOUR SQUAT OTIS LIFTS CROUCHED LIKE IRON TURTLES ON TOP
THE UNBROKEN WHITENESS OF THE UPLANDS TOLD THAT AND EVEN AS THEY SPOKE THERE CAME UP THE HILL THE DARK FIGURES OF THE FARM MEN WITH SHOVELS ON THEIR WAY TO DIG OUT THE SHEEP IN THE SUMMER THE BAILIFF WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CALL THE GIPSIES VAGABONDS AND ROOST ROBBERS
ITS NAME WAS BECAUSE I FORGET HOW MANY THOUSANDS WERE KILLED IN A RIVER BED THERE AND THEY STOVE IN THE WATER CASKS SO THAT IF THE MEN WANTED WATER THEY'D HAVE TO GO FORWARD AND FIGHT FOR IT
ENVYING EVERY ENGLISHMAN WHO STEPPED I DON'T DOUBT
I SAW THE GAME OF TIT TAT TOE THAT ROOUM MADE OF IT IN AN HOUR OR TWO CERTIFICATED OR NOT
WE'D HAD THE DICKENS OF A WALK OF IT JUST WITH KNAPSACKS
WHERE THE STAIRS MADE A TURN
I COULDN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM AS BEING CALLED ANYTHING ELSE THE FIRST IMPRESSION THAT YOU GOT OF HIS HEAD WAS THAT IT WAS A PATCHWORK OF BLACK AND WHITE BLACK BUSHY HAIR AND SHORT WHITE BEARD OR ELSE THE OTHER WAY ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT I CLASSED FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON WITH THE DARK AND IGNORANT SORT OF WORDS SUCH AS OBI AND HOODOO
YOU MIGHT ALMOST SAY IN THAT FORMAL RATHER OLD FASHIONED SALON
BUT AT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE THE SAME THING HAPPENED THAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN THE CLOCK HAD STRUCK SEVEN ROMARIN FOUND HIMSELF SUDDENLY EXPECTANT ATTENTIVE AND THEN AGAIN CURIOUSLY SATISFIED IN HIS MEMORY
BROUGHT UP FLUSH WHERE FORMERLY A RECESS HAD BEEN BECAME THE RECESS ONCE MORE THE INTERMITTENT ELECTRIC SIGN AT THE STREET'S END THAT WROTE IN GREEN AND CRIMSON THE NAME OF A WHISKEY ACROSS A LAMP LIT FACADE CEASED TO WORRY HIS EYES
AH HE CRIED DON'T YOU THINK I JUST FANCY IT MY LAD NOTHING SO EASY I THOUGHT YOU GUESSED THAT OTHER TIME ON THE NEW ROAD IT'S AS PLAIN AS A PIKESTAFF NO NO NO
I'VE ONLY THE VAGUEST IDEA MARSDEN GAVE HIM A LONG LOOK THAT ALL
THAT IT HAD BEEN LATER HIS APPOINTMENT WAS NOT UNTIL A QUARTER PAST
THE USUAL THING PLEASURE AND REGRET MINGLED OH YOU HAVE REGRETS HAVE YOU FOR CERTAIN THINGS YES NOT LET ME SAY MY TURN UP WITH YOU MARSDEN HE LAUGHED
A REGULAR GOBLIN'S TATTER OF COBWEBS DRAPED THE LITTLE BRACKET INSIDE THE DOOR AND THE WROUGHT IRON OF THE HAND RAIL WAS CLOSED UP WITH WEBS IN WHICH NOT EVEN A SPIDER MOVED THE WHOLE THING WAS PREPOSTEROUS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FOR EVEN A LESS RENTAL
AND READ THE PALM WHEN SILVER HAS BEEN PUT UPON IT KNOWING NOTHING BUT SOME OF US SEE SOME OF US SEE IT WAS MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE AUNT RACHEL SPOKE
WHETHER THE NAME OF THAT RUNNER WAS NOT CONSCIENCE BUT CONSCIENCE ISN'T A MATTER OF MOLECULES AND OSMOSIS ONE THING HOWEVER WAS CLEAR I'D GOT TO TELL ROOUM WHAT I'D LEARNED
SAYS THAT ENGLISHMEN DON'T TRAVEL TO SEE ENGLISHMEN I DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE'D STAND TO THAT IN THE CASE OF ENGLISHWOMEN CARROLL AND I DIDN'T
DOES IT EVER TAKE PLACE WITH SOLIDS
THIS ALSO WAS CARPETED BUT WITH A CARPET THAT HAD DONE DUTY IN SOME DINING OR BED ROOM BEFORE BEING CUT UP INTO STRIPS OF THE WIDTH OF THE NARROW SPACE BETWEEN THE WALL AND THE HANDRAIL THEN
BUT YOU COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS NOT PROPERLY ASLEEP IT WAS SOMEHOW LESS TO SABRINA STILL PEERING AT THE BABE IN THE SLING THAN TO AUNT RACHEL APPARENTLY ASLEEP THAT THE GIPSY SEEMED TO REPLY
HOW MANY MEN HAD ALSO LOOKED UPON IT AND LOVED IT SOMEHOW YOU NEVER WONDERED HOW MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN LOVED IN RETURN I'M SO SORRY DEAR AUNT RACHEL WHO IN REALITY WAS A GREAT AUNT SAID
BY THE SIDE OF HER CHAIR OH INFINITELY PRETTY IT WAS THEN CARROLL WANDERED OFF INTO THE QUE CANTES AWFULLY PRETTY IS NOT FOR MYSELF I SING BUT FOR MY FRIEND WHO IS NEAR M E AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW LIKE FOUR OLD FRIENDS WE WERE
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO BRING HER DOWN ALL THOSE STAIRS HOW IS SHE
ONLY RULE OF THUMB PHYSICS THINKS EVERYTHING'S EXPLAINED IN THE MANUAL
EITHER HOPKINS OR SOMEBODY WAS DANGEROUSLY EXCEEDING THE SPEED LIMIT THE THING WAS FLYING ALONG ITS THIRTY YARDS OF RAIL AS FAST AS A TRAM AND THE HEAVY FALL BLOCKS SWUNG LIKE A PONDEROUS KITE TAIL THIRTY FEET BELOW AS I WATCHED THE ENGINE BROUGHT UP WITHIN A YARD OF THE END OF THE WAY
THE BLACK HAIRED SOFT VOICED QUEAN WHOM THE BAILIFF HAD HEARD CALLED ANNABEL SET HER BABE IN THE SLING ON HER BACK TUCKED A BUNDLE OF LONG CANE LOOPS UNDER HER OXTER AND TRUDGED DOWN BETWEEN EIGHT FOOT WALLS OF SNOW TO THE ABBEY FARM
IT WAS ALWAYS THE WHITE HAIRED LADY WHO SPOKE FIRST AND ANNABEL MADE ALL SORTS OF SALUTES AND OBEISANCES WITH HER EYES BEFORE REPLYING I HAVE NOT SEEN YOUR HUSBAND AUNT RACHEL SAID TO ANNABEL ONE DAY
THEY SAT DOWN AT A CORNER TABLE NOT FAR FROM THE SLOWLY MOVING FOUR BLADED PROPELLER NOW WE CAN TALK ROMARIN SAID I'M GLAD GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MARSDEN
WITH THE REST FOR RATHER OLD FASHIONED FINENESS IT WAS LARGE LOFTY BEAUTIFULLY KEPT CARROLL WENT ROUND FOR MISS WHATEVER HER NAME WAS LIGHTING CANDLES IN SCONCES AND AS THE FLAMES CREPT UP THEY GLIMMERED ON A BEAUTIFULLY POLISHED FLOOR
THE DOOR DOES NOT ALWAYS SHUT BEHIND US SUDDENLY PERHAPS ONE WHO HAS TODDLED BUT A STEP OR TWO OVER THE THRESHOLD MIGHT BY LOOKING BACK CATCH A GLIMPSE WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE SMALLEST ONE ANGELA
THE NOTING IN DETAIL OF THE LITTLE THINGS OF THE STREET THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN WITH SUCH COMPLETENESS
SOMEBODY RUNNING AFTER HIM ALL THE TIME AND THEN RUNNING ON AHEAD
RUNNING ALONG THAT IRON TIGHTROPE OUT OVER THAT WELL OF LIGHT AND WATCHING MEN
AS MUCH AS TO SAY I SEE YOU'RE WONDERING WHERE THE CIGARETTE CASE COMES IN
AND VERCINGETORIX AND DANTE AND TRYING TO LEARN PROVENCAL
BAKER'S NOT A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY HE SAID WE GOT THE KEY IT WAS THE KEY OF THE INNER WOODEN DOOR THAT GRID OF RUSTY IRON DIDN'T NEED ONE
I WATCHED HIM TURN THE CORNER IN THE RAIN WE CAME HOME TOGETHER AGAIN THE NEXT EVENING BUT BY A DIFFERENT WAY QUITE HALF A MILE LONGER
A CLOUDY WHITISH GREEN WELL YOU'VE SEEN IT
YES DEAR FLORA'S DEAD THE OLD LADY WHEN SHE SMILED DID SO LESS WITH HER LIPS THAN WITH HER FADED CHEEKS SO SWEET WAS HER FACE THAT YOU COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHEN YOU LOOKED ON IT
WATCHING HIM GULP IT DOWN QUEER LOOKING BACK ACROSS ALL THAT TIME AT EM ISN'T IT HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT IN A MIXED
I SEE MYTHOLOGY THAT'S MADE UP OF TALES AND MYTHS YOU KNOW
BUT AGAIN AUNT RACHEL SHOOK HER HEAD IT NEVER LIVED YOU WERE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL STILL THE SHAKE OF THE HEAD HE DIED ON THE EVE OF HIS WEDDING
SO ON THE WAY ACROSS THE BRIDGE I GAVE IT HIM MORE OR LESS FROM THE BOOK MOLECULAR THEORY AND ALL THE REST OF IT
NO HE REPLIED THINK YOU LEFT IT BEHIND AT THAT PLACE LAST NIGHT YES DID YOU RANGON POPPED IN WITH A TWINKLE I WENT THROUGH ALL MY POCKETS AGAIN NO CIGARETTE CASE
BETWEEN THEM MUST BE PLAYING THE MISCHIEF WITH THE
I JOINED THE BLUE RIBBON WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN AND I HAVEN'T BEEN SORRY FOR IT YET NO NOW THERE'S VEDDER HE WENT OFF ON A BEND AS HE CALLS IT LAST NIGHT AND
HIS PLUMP WHITE ARMS AND SHOULDERS ENOUGH WHITE
IT HAD A LARGE DOUBLE DOOR A DOUBLE DOOR IN TWO SENSES FOR IT WAS A BIG
BUT HE ALWAYS SHOOK HIS BLACK AND WHITE PIEBALD HEAD HE'D NEVER BE ABLE TO KEEP THE BARGAIN IF HE WERE TO MAKE IT HE TOLD US QUITE FAIRLY
MORE I'M PROUD OF IT AT LEAST THERE'S BEEN SINGLENESS OF INTENTION ABOUT IT SO I THINK I'M STRICTLY FAIR IN POINTING THAT OUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HELPING ME PERHAPS SO PERHAPS SO
VENTURED DIFFIDENTLY IF I'M VERY CAREFUL MAY I HOLD IT BEFORE REPLYING THE GIPSY ONCE MORE TURNED HER ALMOND EYES TOWARDS AUNT RACHEL'S CHAIR
THAT ROMANTIC SOAP BUBBLE OF YOURS WAS REALLY AT THE BOTTOM OF IT I SUSPECT TELL ME HE SMILED DID YOU REALLY SUPPOSE LIFE COULD BE LIVED ON THOSE MAD LINES YOU USED TO LAY DOWN
WITH ALWAYS THE SUSPICION NOT FAR AWAY THAT YOU DID THINGS MORE FROM THEORETICAL CONVICTION THAN REAL IMPULSE AFTER ALL
THE UNMOUNTED PAPER MAPS INSTEAD OF THE LINEN ONES WHEN RANGON HIMSELF FOUND US COMING OUT TO MEET US IN A VERY BADLY TURNED OUT TRAP
WELL HE CONTINUED WE GOT BACK TO RANGON'S HOUSE I REALLY DON'T BLAME RANGON FOR THE WAY HE TOOK IT WHEN
INTERLACING EVERYWHERE THE OTHER BED WAS MADE UP
BUT I DIDN'T CARE TO INSIST ON THIS TO THE OLD LADY WHO FOR ALL I KNEW MIGHT HAVE HER OWN REASONS FOR KEEPING TO HERSELF AND AFTER ALL IT WAS OUR PLACE TO RETURN RANGON'S HOSPITALITY IN LONDON
HE WALKED TO THE DOOR MYSELF FOLLOWING HIM TO GET HIS HAT AND STICK I HEARD HIM HUMMING SOFTLY THE LINES THEY ARE FROM OFT IN THE STILLY NIGHT
WE BEGGED HIM OF COURSE NOT TO ALLOW US TO INTERFERE WITH HIS BUSINESS IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE HE THANKED US A THOUSAND TIMES BUT THOUGH WE DINE IN THE VILLAGE WE WILL TAKE OUR OWN WINE WITH US HE SAID A WINE SURFIN ONE OF MY WINES YOU SHALL SEE
AT ANOTHER MAN ALMOST AS TERRIFIED I FELT SOMEBODY'S HAND ON MY OWN ARM EVIDENTLY SOMEBODY THOUGHT I'D KNOCKED ROOUM DOWN THE TERROR WENT SLOWLY FROM HIS FACE HE STUMBLED TO HIS FEET
HIS BROW WAS RIBBED LIKE A GRIDIRON
WHEN I ASKED HIM WHAT I SAID HE HESITATED
PUTTING YOUR HAND ON A MAN'S SHOULDER LIKE THAT JUST WHEN
WHAT DID YOU SAY HIS NAME WAS
YES WE WILL PRESENTLY AUNT RACHEL GEE UP HORSE SHALL WE GO AND ASK THE CHAIR WOMAN IF SHE'S WARM ENOUGH DO DEARS AGAIN THE MESSAGE WAS TAKEN AND THIS TIME IT SEEMED AS IF ANNABEL THE GIPSY WAS NOT WARM ENOUGH
THAT HUNG FROM THE CENTRE BEAM IN THE INTERVALS OF KISSING THEY TOLD ONE ANOTHER IN WHISPERS THAT AUNT RACHEL WAS NOT VERY WELL AND ANGELA WOKE FLORA TO TELL HER THAT AUNT RACHEL HAD BROWN TITUS ALSO
HE ASKED US AND MEET HIM AGAIN THERE HE SAID BUT AS HIS AGENT LIVED IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS OWN HOME
AND WITHIN A VERY LITTLE WHILE SUBDUED NOISES WERE HEARD OUTSIDE AND THE LIFTING OF THE LATCH OF THE YARD GATE THE CHILDREN WERE IN THEIR NIGHTGOWNS HARDLY FULLY AWAKE A LOW VOICE OUTSIDE WAS HEARD GIVING ORDERS
ANNABEL STILL CAME DAILY TO THE FARM SAT ON THE BOX THEY USED TO COVER THE SEWING MACHINE AND WOVE MATS AS SHE WOVE THEM AUNT RACHEL KNITTED AND FROM TIME TO TIME FRAGMENTS OF TALK PASSED BETWEEN THE TWO WOMEN
WHO HANG BRICK AND TERRA COTTA ON OUR WORK AND CLAP A PINNACLE OR TWO ON TOP BUT NEVER MIND THAT
BUT THE OLD WALNUT CHAIR DID NOT MOVE UPON ITS ROCKERS THERE WAS MERRY TALK BUT AUNT RACHEL TOOK NO PART IN IT THE BOARD WAS SPREAD WITH ALE AND CHEESE AND SPICED LOAF FOR THE CAROL SINGERS AND THE TIME DREW NEAR FOR THEIR COMING
SHE LEANED SO CLOSE TOWARDS HER THAT SHE HAD TO PUT UP A HAND TO STEADY THE BABE AT HER BACK LADY DEAR SHE MURMURED WITH IRRESISTIBLE SOFTNESS YOUR HUSBAND DIED DIDN'T HE ON AUNT RACHEL'S FINGER WAS A RING
BUT I'D HAD ENOUGH I'D ASKED QUESTIONS THE NIGHT BEFORE BUT NOW WELL I KNEW QUITE AS MUCH AS AND MORE THAN I WANTED STOP PLEASE I SAID YOU'RE EITHER OFF YOUR HEAD OR WORSE LET'S
NO ANNABEL SHE SAID GENTLY YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN WHEN THE SNOW MELTS YOU WILL GO AND COME NO MORE WHY THEN DID YOU SPEAK IT WAS MINE IT WAS NOT MEANT TO BE SEEN BY ANOTHER
AND I'D LIKE ANOTHER DRINK HE PUT THE KNIFE DOWN WITH A LITTLE CLAP AS ROMARIN BECKONED TO THE WAITER THERE WAS DISTRESS ON ROMARIN'S FACE HE WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF HAVING ADOPTED A SUPERIOR ATTITUDE
AND THAT WAS WHEN ROOUM TOOK FROM HIS BLACK HAND BAG A BRUSH AND A TORN NIGHTGOWN THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS CARRY ABOUT IS IT I REMARKED AND ROOUM GRUNTED SOMETHING YES
IT IS A NEW KIND BUT NO MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE OTHER THE OTHER I HAVE SEEN NOW I HAVE SEEN THIS ALSO TELL ME DOES IT COME TO ANY OTHER CHAIR IT WAS HIS CHAIR HE DIED IN IT SAID AUNT RACHEL
HE REMOVED THEM CRUMPLED THEM UP AND THREW THEM ON THE FIRE AND THE MOMENTARY ADDITION TO THE LIGHT OF THE UPPER CHAMBER SHOWED HOW CURD WHITE WAS THAT SUPERB NECK OF HERS AND HOW MOODY AND TIRED HER EYES
ARISTOCRACY LOGICALLY INVOLVES CASTES BUT SUCH CASTES AS EXIST IN INDIA AND THE SOCIAL CLASSES WE FIND IN THE WESTERN WORLD
BUT THESE NATIVE QUALITIES WILL SIMPLY HAVE ADDED AN INEFFECTUAL TINT TO SOME TYPICAL EXISTENCE OR OTHER AND THE VAST MAJORITY WILL REMAIN AS SCHOPENHAUER SAID FABRIKWAAREN DER NATUR
EXISTENCE ALWAYS HAS AN ORDER CALLED CHAOS WHEN INCOMPATIBLE WITH A CHOSEN GOOD WHETHER CHAOS OR ORDER LAY AT THE BEGINNING OF THINGS IS A QUESTION ONCE MUCH DEBATED IN THE SCHOOLS BUT AFTERWARD LONG IN ABEYANCE
SO LONG HOWEVER AS THE NATION'S VITAL FORCE IS UNSPENT AND TAXES AND SOLDIERS ARE AVAILABLE IN PLENTY A GREAT MONARCHY TENDS TO TURN THOSE RESOURCES TO NOTABLE RESULTS THE ARTS AND SCIENCES ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE PATRONAGE OF MEN OF BREEDING AND AFFAIRS
SOME REAL COMPETENCE ACCRUES TO ANYONE IT IS FOR THE GENERAL INTEREST THAT THIS COMPETENCE SHOULD BEAR ITS NATURAL FRUITS DIVERSIFYING THE FACE OF SOCIETY
SHE HAS BEEN LED TO PUNISH HER MINISTERS FOR THE SERVICES THEY RENDER AND HER FAVOURITES FOR THE HONOURS THEY RECEIVE SHE HAS IMPOSED SUFFERING ON HER CREATURES TOGETHER WITH LIFE SHE HAS DEFEATED HER OWN OBJECTS AND VITIATED HER BOUNTY
THE DISCOVERED CONDITIONS OF REASON NOT ITS BEGINNING TO REVERT TO PRIMORDIAL FEELING IS AN EXERCISE IN MENTAL DISINTEGRATION NOT A FEAT OF SCIENCE WE MIGHT INDEED
AND THE WORLD COULD CONTAIN NOTHING BUT PERFECT AND UNIVERSAL HAPPINESS A DIVINE OMNISCIENCE AND JOY SHARED BY FINITE MINDS IN SO FAR AS THEY MIGHT ATTAIN PERFECTION WOULD BE THE ONLY LIFE IN EXISTENCE AND THE NOTION THAT SUCH A THING AS PAIN
BUT AN IDEAL LIFE MUST NOT TEND TO DESTROY ITS IDEAL BY ABOLISHING ITS OWN EXISTENCE IN THE SECOND PLACE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE ON MORAL GROUNDS THAT INJUSTICE SHOULD SUBSIST IN THE IDEAL THE IDEAL MEANS THE PERFECT
BEGAN TO RESPOND TO REPRESENTED OBJECTS AND TO MAINTAIN THAT INERTIA NOT ABSOLUTELY BY RESISTANCE BUT ONLY RELATIVELY AND INDIRECTLY THROUGH LABOUR
HAVE A SUSPICIOUS OPTIMISM ABOUT THEM YET THE FAITHFUL SLAVE SUCH AS THE NURSE WE FIND IN THE TRAGEDIES MAY SOMETIMES HAVE CORRESPONDED TO THAT DESCRIPTION
VARIETY IN THE WORLD IS AN UNMIXED BLESSING SO LONG AS EACH DISTINCT FUNCTION CAN BE EXERCISED WITHOUT HINDRANCE TO ANY OTHER THERE IS NO GREATER STUPIDITY OR MEANNESS THAN TO TAKE UNIFORMITY FOR AN IDEAL AS IF IT WERE NOT A BENEFIT AND A JOY TO A MAN BEING WHAT HE IS
ALLOTS US OUR DIVERS STATIONS SOMETHING WHICH YOU WILL SEE THERE IS NO ROOM FOR IN THESE CIRCLES IF TO DWELL IN CHARITY BE NEEDFUL HERE AND IF YOU CONSIDER
A LIBERAL LIFE IS MADE POSSIBLE THE IMAGINATION IS STIMULATED AND SET FREE BY THAT SAME BRILLIANT CONCENTRATION OF ALL HUMAN ENERGIES WHICH DEFEATS PRACTICAL LIBERTY AT THE SAME TIME LUXURY AND ALL MANNER OF CONCEITS ARE PART AND PARCEL OF SUCH A COURTLY CIVILISATION
SHOULD LEARN THE SECRETS OF AN UNKNOWN LAND ITS ARTS AND RESOURCES HIS FELLOW CITIZENS ON HIS RETURN WOULD NOT HESITATE TO FOLLOW HIS DIRECTION IN RESPECT TO THOSE NOVEL MATTERS IT WOULD BE SENSELESS FOLLY ON THEIR PART TO BEGRUDGE HIM HIS ADVENTITIOUS EMINENCE
A BRUISED CHILD WAILING IN THE STREET HIS SMALL WORLD FOR THE MOMENT UTTERLY BLACK AND CRUEL BEFORE HIM DOES NOT FETCH HIS UNHAPPINESS FROM SOPHISTICATED COMPARISONS OR IRRATIONAL ENVY
LATENT IDEALS ASSUME PICTURESQUE SHAPES AND TAKE ACTUAL PERSONS FOR THEIR SYMBOLS SUCH COMPANIONSHIP PERHAPS WHOLLY IMAGINARY IS A VERY CLEAR AND SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF IDEAL SOCIETY
THIS REPUTED CHAOS CAN BE DECIPHERED AND APPRECIATED BY MAN ONLY IN PROPORTION AS THE ORDER IN HIMSELF IS CONFIRMED AND EXTENDED
LIE NOT WITHIN HIS UNIVERSE OF ASPIRATION EVEN HIS MOST PERVERSELY METAPHYSICAL ENVY CAN BEGRUDGE TO OTHERS
REPRESENTS THE AGENCIES ON WHICH THOSE FORTUNES DEPEND WHEN THIS DRAMATIC VOCATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS HAS NOT BEEN FULFILLED AT ALL CONSCIOUSNESS IS WHOLLY CONFUSED
DECLENSION FROM PURE VITALITY AND TO DIFFUSE BEING MEANT TO DILUTE IT WITH NOTHINGNESS THIS DECLENSION MIGHT TAKE PLACE IN INFINITE DEGREES EACH RETAINING SOME VESTIGE OF PERFECTION MIXED AS IT WERE
IT INFECTS INTELLIGENCE AND GRANDEUR WITH INHUMANITY AND RENDERS CORRUPT AND ODIOUS THAT PRE EMINENCE WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIVINE THE LOWER CLASSES IN SUBMITTING TO THE HARDSHIP AND MEANNESS OF THEIR LIVES
NATURE MAY ARRANGE HER HIERARCHIES AS SHE CHOOSES
AND EXPRESSED IN FANCY MAY THUS BECOME A MECHANICAL FORCE VITIATING THAT IDEAL FOR THIS REASON IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE FIRST OBJECTS TO FIX THE SOUL'S ADMIRATION
OF A NOBLER TYPE BECAUSE WHEN TASTE AND KNOWLEDGE HAVE NOT YET TAKEN SHAPE THE ONLY WAY OFTEN IN WHICH IDEAL INTERESTS CAN HERALD THEMSELVES IS IN THE GUISE OF SOME IMAGINED UNION
AND OF DIVERGENCE IN OCCUPATION MAN AND WIFE ARE BOUND TOGETHER BY A COMMON DWELLING COMMON FRIENDS COMMON AFFECTION FOR CHILDREN AND WHAT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE COMMON FINANCIAL INTERESTS
A FEUDAL GOVERNMENT WHILE IT LASTED WAS ACCORDINGLY HIGHLY RESPONSIVE AND RESPONSIBLE IF FALSE TO ITS CALLING IT COULD BE READILY DISOWNED FOR IT IS EASY TO BREAK AN OATH AND TO MAKE NEW MILITARY ASSOCIATIONS ESPECIALLY WHERE TERRITORIAL UNITS ARE SMALL AND THEIR LINKS ACCIDENTAL
WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND AN ABSTRACT TOKEN BECAUSE OF ITS NATURAL INSIPIDITY
AN INITIAL ADVANTAGE WHICH MAY EASILY ROLL UP AND INCREASE PRODIGIOUSLY BECOMING THE BASIS OF PROLONGED GOOD FORTUNE SOMETIMES THIS INITIAL ADVANTAGE IS A MATTER OF NATURAL STRUCTURE LIKE TALENT STRENGTH OR GOODNESS SOMETIMES AN ACCIDENTAL ACCRETION LIKE BREEDING
MAN IN SUCH A SYSTEM COULD NO MORE PINE TO BE GOD THAN HE COULD PINE TO BE THE LAW OF GRAVITY OR SPINOZA'S SUBSTANCE OR HEGEL'S DIALECTICAL IDEA
BECAUSE JEHOVAH ONCE FOUGHT FOR THE JEWS WE NEED NOT CONTINUE TO SAY THAT THE TRUTH IS SOLICITOUS ABOUT US WHEN IT IS ONLY WE THAT ARE FIGHTING TO ATTAIN IT
HE MAY EVEN REGARD ALL NATURE AS NOTHING BUT HIS HALF VOLUNTARY DREAM AND ENCOURAGE HIMSELF THEREBY TO GIVE EVEN TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD A DRAMATIC
EACH MAN'S MEMORY EMBRACES A CERTAIN FIELD AND IF THE LANDSCAPE OPEN TO HIS VISION IS SAD AND HATEFUL HE NATURALLY WISHES IT TO SHIFT AND BECOME LIKE THAT PARADISE IN WHICH AS HE FANCIES OTHER MEN DWELL
THE WORLD IT ENVISAGES SEEMS CONSEQUENTLY A CHAOS LATER IF EXPERIENCE HAS FALLEN INTO SHAPE
IN ORDER TO BOAST THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PROPAGATED CULTURE IS ON THE HORNS OF THIS DILEMMA IF PROFOUND AND NOBLE IT MUST REMAIN RARE IF COMMON IT MUST BECOME MEAN THESE ALTERNATIVES CAN NEVER BE ELUDED
INITIAL DIFFERENCES IN TEMPER MUST BE ORGANISED INTO CUSTOM AND BECOME CUMULATIVE BY BEING IMITATED AND ENFORCED THE ONLY ARTISTS WHO CAN SHOW GREAT ORIGINALITY ARE THOSE TRAINED IN DISTINCT AND ESTABLISHED SCHOOLS
GROWING DAILY MORE ERRATIC EARLY FRIENDS FIND THEMSELVES VERY SOON PARTED BY UNBRIDGEABLE CHASMS FOR FRIENDSHIP TO FLOURISH PERSONAL LIFE WOULD HAVE TO BECOME MORE PUBLIC AND SOCIAL LIFE MORE SIMPLE AND HUMANE
IS ALSO ADVENTITIOUS AND IDEALLY TRANSFERABLE AND WHETHER JACK AND JILL REMAINING THEMSELVES COULD HAVE EXCHANGED GENDERS WHAT EXTENDS THESE INVIDIOUS COMPARISONS BEYOND ALL TOLERABLE BOUNDS
BUT BY AWAKENING AN INEXPRESSIBLE ANIMAL SYMPATHY BY THE CONTAGION OF EMOTIONS FELT BEFORE THE SAME OBJECTS ESTIMATION HAS BEEN PARTLY ARRESTED AT ITS MEDIUM
AT THE BIRTH OF SOCIETY INSTINCTS EXISTED NEEDFUL TO THE ANIMAL AND HAVING A CERTAIN GLORIOUS IMPETUOSITY ABOUT THEM WHICH PROMPTED COMMON ACTION AND SPEECH AND A PUBLIC MORALITY AND MEN WERE LED TO CONSTRUCT MYTHS THAT MIGHT SEEM TO JUSTIFY THIS CO OPERATION
AMBIGUITIES OF FAME THE HIGHEST FORM OF VANITY IS LOVE OF FAME IT IS A PASSION EASY TO DERIDE BUT HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND IN MEN WHO LIVE AT ALL BY IMAGINATION
EACH OFFICE WOULD REMAIN FILLED AND NO TRACE OF A CHANGE WOULD BE PERCEPTIBLE BUT THE PENNY THAT ONE MAN FINDS AND ANOTHER MISSES WOULD NOT HAD FORTUNE BEEN REVERSED HAVE TRANSMUTED EACH MAN INTO THE OTHER
CAN NEVER INVOLVE THE INFLICTION OF INJURY ON ANYBODY FOR ANY PURPOSE SUCH AN IDEAL WOULD PROPOSE FOR A GOAL SOMETHING OUT OF EQUILIBRIUM A SOCIETY WHICH EVEN IF ESTABLISHED COULD NOT MAINTAIN ITSELF
AND IF REPEATED AND SUSTAINED BECOMES A SPIRITUAL POSSESSION
ABSOLUTE ORDER OR TRUTH IS STATIC IMPOTENT INDIFFERENT OF COURSE THE VARIOUS STATES OF THE WORLD WHEN WE SURVEY THEM RETROSPECTIVELY CONSTITUTE ANOTHER AND NOW STATIC ORDER CALLED HISTORIC TRUTH
A KING HAS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE HIMSELF LOVED THIS SCOPE GIVEN TO PRIVATE INCLINATION IS WHAT TO ORDINARY FANCY MAKES ROYALTY ENVIABLE FEW ENVY ITS IMPERSONAL POWER AND HISTORIC WEIGHT
MUST ALWAYS HAVE OBTAINED ELSE SUCCESSIVE STATES WOULD STAND IN NO RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER NOTABLY NOT IN THE RELATION OF CAUSE AND EFFECT EXPRESSED IN A NATURAL LAW WHICH IS PRESUPPOSED IN THIS INSTANCE
AND HE WOULD LAUGH AT THEM AS HE MIGHT AT THE STOCK FORTUNE TELLING OF SOME ITINERANT GYPSY AS IT IS HOWEVER
SINCE LUXURY AND INJUSTICE WE ARE TOLD FIRST NECESSITATED WAR AND THE GUIDING IDEA OF ALL THE PLATONIC REGIMEN IS MILITARY EFFICIENCY
THE MIND SPREADS AND SOARS IN PROPORTION AS THE BODY FEEDS ON THE SURROUNDING WORLD NOBLE IDEAS ALTHOUGH RARE AND DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN ARE NOT NATURALLY FUGITIVE
AND MAKES THEIR CULTIVATION MORE INTENSE AND SUCCESSFUL WHEN AN IDEAL INTEREST IS GENERAL THE SHARE WHICH FALLS TO THE PRIVATE PERSON IS THE MORE APT TO BE EFFICACIOUS THE SAINTS HAVE USUALLY HAD COMPANIONS
THIS SLIGHT BOND SUFFICED HOWEVER TO GIVE HIM A GREAT PRESTIGE AND TO STIMULATE IN HIM ALL THE HABITS AND VIRTUES OF A RESPONSIBLE MASTER SO THAT IN ENGLAND WHERE VESTIGES OF FEUDALISM ABOUND TO THIS DAY
ON THE OTHER THE FINITE VALUES OF ALL THE CREATED HIERARCHY ACCORDING TO THEISTIC COSMOLOGY THERE WAS A METAPHYSICAL NECESSITY IF CREATURES WERE TO EXIST AT ALL THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN SOME MEASURE INFERIOR TO GODHEAD OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN INDISTINGUISHABLE
REASON HAS THUS SUPERVENED AT THE LAST STAGE OF AN ADAPTATION WHICH HAD LONG BEEN CARRIED ON BY IRRATIONAL AND EVEN UNCONSCIOUS PROCESSES NATURE PRECEDED
FRIENDSHIP MAY INDEED COME TO EXIST WITHOUT SENSUOUS LIKING OR COMRADESHIP TO PAVE THE WAY BUT UNLESS INTELLECTUAL SYMPATHY AND MORAL APPRECIATION ARE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO REACT ON NATURAL INSTINCT
VARIETY IN HUMAN DREAMS LIKE PERSONALITY AMONG SAVAGES MAY INDEED BE INWARDLY VERY GREAT BUT IT IS NOT EFFICACIOUS TO BE SOCIALLY IMPORTANT AND EXPRESSIBLE IN SOME COMMON MEDIUM
THE ONLY PARADISE SUCH PIOUS RESIGNATION HAS IN IT SOMETHING PATHETIC AND CONSTRAINED
THEY ARE PROJECTED INTO HIS OWN FORGOTTEN PAST OR INFINITE FUTURE HE WILL THEN SAY THAT ALL EXPERIENCE IS REALLY HIS OWN AND
IT HAS NO COGENCY FOR THE INATTENTIVE AND NO EXISTENCE FOR THE IGNORANT ALTHOUGH THE UNIVERSE THEN MAY NOT HAVE COME FROM CHAOS HUMAN EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY HAS BEGUN IN A PRIVATE AND DREAMFUL CHAOS OF ITS OWN
POTENTIALITIES ARE DISPOSITIONS AND A DISPOSITION INVOLVES AN ORDER AS DOES ALSO THE PASSAGE FROM ANY SPECIFIC POTENTIALITY INTO ACT THUS THE WORLD WE ARE TOLD MUST ALWAYS HAVE POSSESSED A STRUCTURE
BUT DISTINCTION NEVERTHELESS IS PERFECTLY REAL AND NOT MERELY IMPUTED IN VAIN DOES THE MAN IN THE STREET DECLARE THAT HE TOO COULD HAVE BEEN A KING IF HE HAD BEEN BORN IN THE PURPLE
AS IT DOES WHEN AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY HAS A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT HERE THE PEOPLE NEITHER ACCEPT GUIDANCE NOR REQUIRE PROTECTION BUT THE EXISTENCE OF A RICH AND IRRESPONSIBLE CLASS OFFERS THEM AN IDEAL SUCH AS IT IS
AND A SUPPOSED IDEAL IN WHICH WRONG STILL SUBSISTED WOULD BE THE DENIAL OF PERFECTION THE IDEAL STATE AND THE IDEAL UNIVERSE SHOULD BE A FAMILY WHERE ALL ARE NOT EQUAL BUT WHERE ALL ARE HAPPY
IN ATTAINING ITS OWN END TO MAKE THE ATTAINMENTS OF THE OTHERS ENDS POSSIBLE TO THEM ALSO AN APPROACH TO SUCH AN EQUILIBRIUM HAS ACTUALLY BEEN REACHED IN SOME RESPECTS BY THE ROUGH SIFTING OF MISCELLANEOUS ORGANISMS
FROM THE GODHEAD ITSELF ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE CALLED THE IDENTITY OF INDISCERNIBLES WHICH DECLARES THAT TWO BEINGS EXACTLY ALIKE CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT COLLAPSING INTO AN UNDIVIDED UNIT THE PROPAGATION OF LIFE INVOLVED THEN
BUT SO LONG AS PEOPLE REMAIN ON WHAT SUCH AN INVALUABLE OPTIMIST MIGHT CALL THE LOW LEVEL OF SENSUOUS THOUGHT AND SO LONG AS WE IMAGINE THAT WE EXIST AND SUFFER AN ARISTOCRATIC REGIMEN CAN ONLY BE JUSTIFIED
SOME BY ENERGY AND PERSEVERANCE RISE FROM THE BOTTOM SOME BY ILL FORTUNE OR VICE FALL FROM THE TOP BUT THESE READJUSTMENTS ARE INSIGNIFICANT
HAS BECOME A DIALOGUE OR RATHER A SOLO WITH AN ECHOING CHORUS INTEREST IN ONE'S OWN SOCIAL FIGURE IS TO SOME EXTENT A MATERIAL INTEREST FOR OTHER MEN'S LOVE OR AVERSION
IT CELEBRATES AN ATTAINED BALANCE IN NATURE OR GRIEVES AT ITS COLLAPSE
SO THAT IF WE IMPUTE TO CRONOS ANY INTENT TO BEGET HIS CHILDREN WE MUST ALSO IMPUTE TO HIM AN INTENT TO DEVOUR THEM
HE WOULD UTTERLY DESPISE THE IGNORANT NOTIONS OTHERS MIGHT FORM ON A SUBJECT IN WHICH HE HAD SUCH MATCHLESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR OBSERVATION INDEED THOSE OPINIONS WOULD HARDLY SEEM TO HIM DIRECTED UPON THE REALITY AT ALL
IN OTHER REGIONS IT IS SURELY TRUE THAT TO ADVANCE IN CONVENTIONAL STATION WOULD OFTEN ENTAIL A LOSS IN TRUE DIGNITY AND HAPPINESS IT WOULD SELDOM BENEFIT A MUSICIAN TO BE APPOINTED ADMIRAL OR A HOUSEMAID TO BECOME A PRIMA DONNA
FOR A THEISM WHICH LIKE ARISTOTLE'S AND DANTE'S HAS A PLATONIC ESSENCE GOD IS REALLY NOTHING BUT THE GOAL OF HUMAN ASPIRATION EMBODIED IMAGINATIVELY THIS FACT MAKES THESE PHILOSOPHERS FEEL THAT WHATEVER FALLS SHORT OF DIVINITY HAS SOMETHING IMPERFECT ABOUT IT
A THEORY OF ORIGINS OF SUBSTANCE AND OF NATURAL LAWS MAY THUS BE FRAMED AND ACCEPTED AND MAY RECEIVE CONFIRMATION IN THE FURTHER MARCH OF EVENTS IT WILL BE OBSERVED HOWEVER
FOR NATURE'S PRIMEVAL CRUELTY WHILE THE BENEFITS IT MAY ALSO CONFER ARE ONLY FURTHER EXAMPLES OF HER NICE EQUILIBRIUM AND NECESSARY HARMONY FOR IT LIES IN THE ESSENCE OF A MECHANICAL WORLD WHERE THE INTERESTS OF ITS PRODUCTS
ACCORDINGLY WHENEVER A MONARCHY IS AT ALL REPRESENTATIVE TIME HAS AN IRRESISTIBLE TENDENCY TO INCREASE ITS PRESTIGE THE KING IS FELT TO BE THE GUARDIAN AS WELL AS THE SYMBOL OF ALL PUBLIC GREATNESS MEANTIME A DOUBLE DISLOCATION IS POSSIBLE HERE PATRIOTISM MAY BE WHOLLY IDENTIFIED WITH PERSONAL LOYALTY TO THE SOVEREIGN
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HAS NO PRACTICAL FORCE SAVE THAT WHICH MECHANICAL CAUSES ENDOW IT WITH ITS PRIVILEGES ARE FRUITS OF INEVITABLE ADVANTAGES ITS OPPRESSIONS ARE SIMPLY NEW FORMS AND VEHICLES
WHO IS THEREBY FIRST DISCOVERED AND DEPUTED TO BE A HERO HE IS AN UNMOVED MOVER LIKE ARISTOTLE'S GOD AND LIKE EVERY IDEAL TO WHICH THOUGHT OR ACTION IS DIRECTED
A HIGHLY CONCENTRATED MONARCHY PRESENTS THE EXACTLY OPPOSITE PHENOMENON HERE SUBORDINATION IS INVOLUNTARY AND MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY LARGELY UNCONSCIOUS ON THE OTHER HAND THE SCOPE OF REPRESENTATION IS VERY WIDE AND THE MONARCH MAY WELL EMBODY THE WHOLE LIFE OF THE NATION
FROM WHICH IT IS VAGUELY FELT THEY MIGHT BE DEVELOPED JUST AS IN LOVE SEXUAL AND SOCIAL INSTINCTS
BUT THIS PERSONAL CONSCIOUS AND JEALOUS SUBORDINATION OF MAN TO MAN CONSTITUTED A GOVERNMENT OF INSIGNIFICANT SCOPE
AN EXCHANGE OF PLACES WITH SUCH REMOTE BEINGS WOULD TOO EVIDENTLY LEAVE EACH CREATURE THE VERY SAME THAT IT WAS BEFORE FOR AFTER A NOMINAL EXCHANGE OF PLACES
TO THIS ABSOLUTE AND IMPOTENT ORDER EVERY DETAIL IS ESSENTIAL IF WE WISHED TO ABUSE LANGUAGE SO MUCH AS TO SPEAK OF WILL IN AN ABSOLUTE WHERE CHANGE IS EXCLUDED
NOR CAN ANY COMPENSATIONS AND CELESTIAL HARMONIES SUPERVENING LATER EVER EXPUNGE OR JUSTIFY THAT MOMENT'S BITTERNESS THE PAIN MAY BE WHISTLED AWAY AND FORGOTTEN
HEAVEN CAN CONSIST ONLY IN APOTHEOSIS THIS THE GREEKS KNEW VERY WELL THEY INSTINCTIVELY IGNORED OR FEARED ANY IMMORTALITY WHICH FELL SHORT OF DEIFICATION AND THE CHRISTIAN MYSTICS REACHED THE SAME GOAL BY LESS OVERT COURSES
WHEN THEY SET SO HIGH A VALUE ON FAME THEY OFTEN IDENTIFIED FAME WITH IMMORTALITY
WHERE NO SUITABLE PERSONS ARE FOUND TO EMBODY THE STATE'S UNITY OTHER SYMBOLS HAVE TO BE CHOSEN
YET IT IS USED TO DESIGNATE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS REALLY DEFINABLE NOT BY THE FORMAL SELFHOOD WHICH HE SHARES WITH EVERY OTHER THINKER BUT BY THE SPECIAL EVENTS THAT MAKE UP HIS LIFE
YES YES YES OF COURSE THEN ON ENTERING A CERTAIN VILLAGE HE BADE ME TAKE HIS CLASP KNIFE AND GET TWO HORSES WITH IT AND BRING BACK THE KNIFE TO HIM
VERY SOON HE HOPED TO SEE HIS DEAR LAND AGAIN BUT MANY A LONG AND WEARY DAY WAS TO PASS ERE ODYSSEUS CAME HOME ODYSSEUS WAS A WARRIOR AND ALWAYS HE WOULD CHOOSE TO FIGHT RATHER THAN TO BE AT PEACE
AND GOLDEN RIPE PEARS AND ROSY APPLES AT ALL OF THOSE WONDERS ODYSSEUS STOOD AND GAZED BUT IT WAS NOT FOR LONG FOR HE HASTENED THROUGH THE HALLS TO WHERE THE QUEEN SAT IN THE FIRELIGHT SPINNING HER PURPLE YARN
AND CARRY THEM TO THE SHIPS THEN LET US RETURN AND DRIVE ALL THE KIDS AND LAMBS FROM THEIR FOLDS DOWN TO THE SHORE AND SAIL WITH THEM IN OUR SWIFT SHIPS HOMEWARD OVER THE SEA BUT ODYSSEUS WOULD NOT LISTEN TO WHAT THEY SAID
AND WHOSE FIELDS YET GAVE THEM RICH HARVESTS OF WHEAT AND OF BARLEY AND VINES WITH HEAVY CLUSTERS OF GRAPES IN DEEP CAVES HIGH UP ON THE HILLS THESE PEOPLE DWELT AND EACH MAN RULED HIS OWN WIFE AND CHILDREN
HE TURNED TO GAZE ON HIS BELOVED DIMLY HE SAW HER BUT FOR THE LAST TIME FOR A POWER SHE COULD NOT RESIST DREW HER BACK ORPHEUS STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS AND TRIED TO SEIZE HER BUT HE ONLY CLASPED THE EMPTY AIR
WHICH IS IN MY POSSESSION WHEN HARISARMAN HEARD THAT HE SAID TO HER PROUDLY
LOOK INTO THE FACE OF HER CHILD LOKI THE MISCHIEF MAKER AMONG THE GIANTS OFTEN LOOKED AT SIB AND LONGED TO DO HER SOME EVIL
A HOST OF PEOPLE CAME FROM INLAND IN THE EARLY MORNING THICK AS LEAVES AND FLOWERS IN THE SPRING THEY CAME AND FELL UPON ODYSSEUS AND HIS MEN ALL DAY THEY FOUGHT BUT AS THE SUN WENT DOWN THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND WON THE FIGHT
WHO HAD DURING THEIR LIVES PRETENDED TO BE UPRIGHT AND HONORABLE IN ORDER TO DECEIVE THE JUST BUT THESE WRETCHES WERE NOT THE ONLY DENIZENS OF BLACK TARTARUS THERE WERE TO BE SEEN GREAT SCOUNDRELS WHO HAD STARTLED THE WORLD WITH THEIR FRIGHTFUL CRIMES
NO LESS THAN NINE TIMES ON REACHING THE BANKS OF STYX HERCULES WAS SURPRISED TO SEE FLYING AROUND HIM A CROWD OF DISCONSOLATE SPIRITS WHOM CHARON THE FERRYMAN REFUSED TO ROW ACROSS STYX BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT PAY HIM HIS FEE OF AN OBOL
ALL DAY LONG THEY WOULD SIT AND DREAM AND DREAM IDLE HAPPY DREAMS THAT NEVER ENDED HERE ODYSSEUS AND HIS MEN LANDED AND DREW WATER THREE OF HIS WARRIORS ODYSSEUS SENT INTO THE COUNTRY TO SEE WHAT
SIR LUCAN AND SIR BEDIVERE
IF YOU LOVE ME
WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF ALL THIS TROUBLE INDICATES THAT THERE IS A MAN IN THE PALACE WHO IS PLOTTING AGAINST THE KING'S LIFE JOY JOY EXCLAIMED THE VIZIER'S SON
BECAUSE THE GIANT AMERAUNT WAS KEEPING HIS DAUGHTER AND FIFTEEN SONS IN A STRONG CASTLE I AM EARL JONAS OF DURRAS HE SAID AND I SEEK GUY OF WARWICK TO HELP ME GUY SAID IF THE EARL WOULD GIVE HIM MEAT AND DRINK
SOME DAY THOU WILT MARRY NAUSICAA SHE SAID
AT TIMES SHE EVEN THOUGHT OF KILLING HERSELF SHE WOULD DRAW OUT GUY'S GREAT SWORD WHICH HE HAD LEFT BEHIND AND THINK HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO RUN IT THROUGH HER HEART
THERE ABODE IN THESSALY IN THE DAYS OF HERCULES A STRANGE RACE OF MEN WHO HAD THE HEAD AND ARMS OF A MAN TOGETHER WITH THE BODY OF A HORSE THEY WERE CALLED CENTAURS OR BULL SLAYERS
NOW CAME THE LAST TEST OF SINDRI'S CUNNING
THEN COME QUICKLY AND TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE SIR BEDIVERE TOOK THE SWORD AND WENT DOWN TO THE LAKE BUT AS HE LOOKED AT THE HANDLE WITH ITS SPARKLING GEMS
GREAT ATTENTION WAS SHOWN TO HIM AND HE WAS TREATED IN EVERY WAY AS IF HE WERE THE SON OF A GREAT MAN ALTHOUGH HIS HUMBLE HOST KNEW NOTHING OF HIS ORIGIN AT LENGTH HE TOLD THEM EVERYTHING ABOUT THE LAUGHING OF THE FISH HIS FATHER'S THREATENED EXECUTION AND HIS OWN BANISHMENT
WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN TO HIM WHILE BROK CARRIED THE THREE MARVELS WHICH SINDRI HAD SO CUNNINGLY WROUGHT AND ACCOMPANIED THE MISCHIEF MAKER THAT THE GODS MIGHT JUDGE WHO HAD WON THE WAGER SO RASHLY OFFERED BY LOKI
TO MAKE SOME GOLDEN HAIR FOR SIB AS GOOD AS THAT WHICH HE HAD DESTROYED
STAY HERE ALL THE REST OF YOU MY DEAR COMPANIONS BUT I WILL GO WITH MY OWN SHIP AND MY SHIP'S COMPANY AND SEE WHAT KIND OF MEN ARE THOSE WHO DWELL IN THIS LAND ACROSS THE HARBOR
SO THEY CALLED TO HER AND SHE CAME FORTH AND BADE THEM ENTER HEEDLESSLY THEY FOLLOWED HER ALL BUT EURYLOCHUS
AND STHULADATTA THEN PROPITIATED THE BRAHMAN WITH THESE WORDS
AND MADE THEM FLOW RIGHT THROUGH THE STABLES THEMSELVES AND LO THE NUISANCE THAT HAD BEEN GROWING FOR THIRTY YEARS WAS NO MORE SUCH WAS THE FIFTH LABOR OF HERCULES ON AN ISLAND IN A LAKE NEAR STYMPHALUS IN ARCADIA
THEN THOR PULLED HIM OUT AND SHOOK HIM FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN HIS ENORMOUS HANDS
AND BEFORE IT IS CARRIED OFF TO A DISTANCE AS IT WILL BE AT CLOSE OF DAY GO QUICKLY AND BRING IT WHEN THEY HEARD THAT MANY MEN RAN AND BROUGHT THE HORSE QUICKLY
BUT PASS HIM BY AND CAST THYSELF
IN THE MEANWHILE I SO FAR AS ONE MAN MAY DO WILL STAY THE ENEMY AND AS HE SPAKE HE RAN FORWARD TO THE FARTHER END OF THE BRIDGE AND MADE READY TO KEEP THE WAY AGAINST THE ENEMY NEVERTHELESS THERE STOOD TWO WITH HIM
THEN AT LAST HE KNEW THAT THE GODS BELOW WERE PITILESS AND FULL OF SORROW HE RETURNED TO THE UPPER EARTH FOR THREE YEARS
THAT IN FREEDOM WHICH MEN GREATLY DESIRE AND IF THEY THAT BE KINGS DEFEND NOT THEIR DIGNITY AS STOUTLY AS OTHERS SEEK TO OVERTHROW IT THEN SHALL THE HIGHEST BE MADE EVEN AS THE LOWEST AND THERE SHALL BE AN END OF KINGSHIP THAN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING MORE HONORABLE UNDER HEAVEN
BUT LET ME FIRST INQUIRE IF YOU PLEASE WHETHER THE BEAM OF YOUR HOUSE IS STRONG THE OLD FARMER LEFT HIM IN DESPAIR AND ENTERED HIS HOUSE LAUGHING THERE IS A MAN IN YONDER FIELD HE SAID AFTER RETURNING THEIR GREETINGS
THESE SERPENTS GLIDING INTO HIS CRADLE WERE ON THE POINT OF BITING THE CHILD WHEN HE WITH HIS OWN HANDS SEIZED THEM AND STRANGLED THE LIFE OUT OF THEIR SLIMY BODIES HAVING GROWN UP TO MAN'S ESTATE HERCULES DID MANY MIGHTY DEEDS OF VALOR
WHICH MEANS TONGUE WHO WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HER BROTHER HAD STOLEN THAT TREASURE FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE PALACE SHE BEING ALARMED AT HARISARMAN'S KNOWLEDGE
ALL THE DOORS WERE MADE OF GOLD THE DOORPOSTS WERE OF SILVER THE THRESHOLDS OF BRASS AND THE HOOK OF THE DOOR WAS OF GOLD IN THE HALLS WERE GOLDEN FIGURES OF ANIMALS
AS HE GREW OLDER HE BECAME A GREAT FAVORITE AND WAS OFTEN INVITED TO THE CASTLE LORD ROHAND HEARD OF GUY AND ASKED HIM TO A GREAT DINNER AT WARWICK CASTLE AND AFTERWARDS TO JOIN IN A TOURNAMENT
BUT SIR LUCAN HAD BEEN WOUNDED IN THE BATTLE AND AS HE LIFTED THE KING HE FELL BACK AND DIED
SAW THAT SOMETHING LIVING HAD CERTAINLY TOUCHED THEM THEY THEN ADDED A WEIGHT TO THE NET AND THREW IT WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER AND DRAGGED UP THE STONES IN THE POOL LOKI NOW SAW THE DANGER HE WAS IN OF BEING CAUGHT IN THE NET AND
FOR THESE PLUTO AND THE FURIES HAD INVENTED SPECIAL TORTURES AMONG THE CRIMINALS SO JUSTLY OVERTAKEN BY THE DIVINE VENGEANCE HERCULES NOTICED SALMONEUS WHOM HE HAD FORMERLY MET UPON EARTH
AND THEIR SAILS WERE TORN TO SHREDS BY THE MIGHT OF THE STORM
AND THE WELCOMING LIGHT OF THE UPPER AIR BEGAN TO PENETRATE THE DARKNESS THEN A SUDDEN FEAR STRUCK HIS HEART
WHICH WERE RED AND WHITE AND YELLOW AND GREEN THEY KNEW THE WAY ALL OVER THE WORLD BY RUNNING THROUGH CAVERNS AND PASSAGES UNDER THE MOUNTAINS AND WHEREVER THEY COULD FIND PRECIOUS STONES OR METALS THEY BUILT A FURNACE AND MADE AN ANVIL AND HAMMER AND BELLOWS
WEAPONS AND ARMOR HE WOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD DO A SPLENDID COAT OF MAIL WAS BROUGHT WITH SHIELD AND SWORD GUY CALLED TO THE GIANT TO COME FORTH THAT WILL I REPLIED THE GIANT
THE WORLD IS LARGE AND I AM VERY CLEVER SAID LOKI TO HIMSELF AS HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON ASGARD AND WANDERED OUT INTO MANHEIM
WHEN ONCE THE FATES HAD DECIDED WHAT THE LOT OF ANY BEING WHETHER GOD OR MAN WAS TO BE JUPITER HIMSELF COULD NOT ALTER THEIR DECISION IT WAS TO THESE FATEFUL THREE THEN THAT JUNO MADE HER PRAYER CONCERNING THE INFANT HERCULES
AND THE RUSH AND GUSH OF THE WATER FROM THE BOW OF THE BOAT TOLD HIM THAT THE SHIP WAS SAILING SPEEDILY TO HIS DEAR LAND OF ITHACA HE FELL INTO A SOUND SLEEP ONWARD WENT THE SHIP
AND ALTHOUGH STILL IN AGONY HIS MADNESS LEFT HIM
ALL YOURS TOO I SHALL TAKE SO THAT THOU SHALT GO TO THE COUNCIL IN LINEN THAT IS SNOWY CLEAN AND I KNOW THAT MY FIVE BROTHERS WILL ALSO BE GLAD IF I WASH THEIR FINE CLOTHING FOR THEM
AND IN THE GLOW LOKI SAW A BROAD RED RING WHICH SEEMED TO LIVE AND MOVE AGAIN HE TRIED TO SPOIL THE WORK AS A FLY AND BIT DEEPLY INTO BROK'S NECK BUT BROK WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS RAISE HIS HAND TO RID HIM OF THE PAIN
WAS TO BE BUT SHORT LIVED FOR AS THE NEW MADE BRIDE WANDERED THROUGH THE WOODS WITH THE OTHER NYMPHS A POISONOUS SERPENT STUNG HER HEEL AND NO REMEDY AVAILED TO SAVE HER ORPHEUS WAS THROWN
IF ONE THINKS OF THE CITY AS THE PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING IS TO BE OBTAINED AND OF INHOSPITABLE PEOPLE AS WORSE THAN THE DEAD THE CITY THOUGH CROWDED WITH PEOPLE WAS AS IF DEAD AS FAR AS YOU WERE CONCERNED WHILE IN THE CEMETERY WHICH IS CROWDED WITH THE DEAD
THE BALL FLEW INTO THE RIVER AND AS IT WAS SWEPT AWAY TO THE SEA THE PRINCESS AND ALL HER MAIDENS SCREAMED ALOUD THEIR CRIES AWOKE ODYSSEUS AS HE LAY ASLEEP IN HIS BED OF LEAVES I MUST BE NEAR THE HOUSES OF MEN HE SAID
AND BESIDES ALL THIS SHE BUILT GREAT CHURCHES AND ABBEYS
HALF WAY THE BEARER OF THIS PRESENT AND MESSAGE MET HIS LITTLE SON WHO SEEING WHAT WAS IN THE BASKET BEGGED HIS FATHER TO GIVE HIM SOME OF THE FOOD HIS FATHER FOOLISHLY COMPLIED PRESENTLY HE SAW THE YOUNG MAN AND GAVE HIM THE REST OF THE PRESENT AND THE MESSAGE
WHERE THEY WERE EVER ENGAGED IN THE HOPELESS TASK OF POURING WATER INTO A SIEVE HYPERMNESTRA ON THE CONTRARY WAS HONORED WHILE ALIVE AND ALSO AFTER HER DEATH FOR LOVING GOODNESS EVEN MORE THAN SHE LOVED HER FATHER
THE KING QUICKLY SUMMONED HARISARMAN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS REPUTATION FOR KNOWLEDGE OF MAGIC AND HE WHEN SUMMONED TRIED TO GAIN TIME AND SAID I WILL TELL YOU TO MORROW
IN THE DAYS OF LONG AGO THERE REIGNED OVER ITHACA A RUGGED LITTLE ISLAND IN THE SEA TO THE WEST OF GREECE A KING WHOSE NAME WAS ODYSSEUS ODYSSEUS FEARED NO MAN STRONGER AND BRAVER THAN OTHER MEN WAS HE
AND WAS CHAINED TO A ROCK ON MOUNT CAUCASUS BECAUSE HE STOLE FIRE FROM HEAVEN AND GAVE IT AS A GIFT TO THE SONS OF MAN WHILE IN CHAINS AN EAGLE WAS SENT BY JUPITER DAILY TO FEED ON PROMETHEUS'S LIVER WHICH JUPITER MADE TO GROW AGAIN EACH NIGHT
ONE OF THESE RAN UP TO THE SKY AND IN THIS CLIFF WAS A DARK CAVE IN WHICH LIVED SCYLLA A HORRIBLE MONSTER WHO AS THE SHIP PASSED SEIZED SIX OF THE MEN WITH HER SIX DREADFUL HEADS
AND THREW IT WITH HIS LYRE INTO THE RIVER HEBRUS THERE IT FLOATED DOWN STREAM AND STRANGE TO TELL THE CHORDS GAVE FORTH A LAMENT AND THE LIFELESS TONGUE UTTERED WORDS
HE LIKED TEASING FOLK BUT HE DID NOT LIKE HAVING TO ATONE FOR HIS MISCHIEF AFTERWARDS HE TURNED THE MARVELOUS GIFTS OVER SCORNFULLY IN HIS HANDS AND SAID THAT HE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING VERY WONDERFUL IN THEM THEN LOOKING AT SINDRI HE ADDED HOWEVER
WISER AND MORE FULL OF CLEVER DEVICES FAR AND WIDE HE WAS KNOWN AS ODYSSEUS OF THE MANY COUNSELS
THROUGH WHICH THE SHIP OF ODYSSEUS WOULD SAIL TOWARD HOME LIVED SOME BEAUTIFUL MERMAIDS CALLED SIRENS EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN THE SIRENS FACES WERE THEIR LOVELY VOICES BY WHICH THEY LURED MEN TO GO ON SHORE AND THERE SLEW THEM
PROFESSING TO BE ON A VISIT TO THE SAME PLACE THE OLD FARMER AGREED AND THEY WALKED ALONG TOGETHER THE DAY WAS HOT AND THE WAY WAS LONG AND WEARY DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE PLEASANTER IF YOU AND I SOMETIMES GAVE EACH OTHER A LIFT SAID THE YOUTH
WHO WOULD WED HER HATH SHE PICKED UP A SHIPWRECKED STRANGER OR IS THIS ONE OF THE GODS WHO HAS COME TO MAKE HER HIS WIFE THEREFORE COME NOT WITH US I PRAY THEE FOR THE SAILORS TO JEST AT
AND IT WAS THEIR DUTY IN WHICH THEY WERE HELPED BY A DRAGON TO GUARD THE GOLDEN APPLES HERCULES KILLED THE DRAGON AND CARRIED OFF THE APPLES BUT THEY WERE AFTERWARDS RESTORED TO THEIR PLACE BY MINERVA
HE TOLD HER OF HIS SHIPWRECK AND BEGGED HER TO SHOW HIM THE WAY TO THE TOWN AND GIVE HIM SOME OLD GARMENT OR ANY OLD WRAP IN WHICH SHE HAD BROUGHT THE LINEN SO THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING BESIDES LEAVES WITH WHICH TO COVER HIMSELF
WHILE THEIR ONLY CHILD A BOY NAMED TELEMACHUS WAS STILL A BABY THERE WAS A VERY GREAT WAR IN TROYLAND A COUNTRY FAR ACROSS THE SEA THE BROTHER OF THE OVERLORD OF ALL GREECE BESEIGED TROY
STARTED OFF WHITHERSOEVER FATE MIGHT LEAD HIM HE HAD BEEN GONE SOME DAYS WHEN HE FELL IN WITH AN OLD FARMER WHO ALSO WAS ON A JOURNEY TO A CERTAIN VILLAGE FINDING THE OLD MAN VERY PLEASANT HE ASKED HIM IF HE MIGHT ACCOMPANY HIM
BUT WHEN WE COME NEAR THE TOWN WITH ITS HIGH WALLS AND TOWERS AND HARBORS FULL OF SHIPS THE ROUGH SAILORS WILL STARE AND SAY HATH NAUSICAA GONE TO FIND HERSELF A HUSBAND
WITH MUCH RICH PLUNDER THE BESIEGERS SAILED HOMEWARDS AND ODYSSEUS SET SAIL FOR HIS ROCKY ISLAND WITH ITS GREAT MOUNTAIN AND ITS FORESTS OF TREMBLING LEAVES OF GLADNESS AND OF LONGING HIS HEART WAS FULL
AS HE SAILED ON HIS HOMEWARD WAY WINDS DROVE HIS SHIPS NEAR THE SHORE HE AND HIS COMPANY LANDED SACKED THE NEAREST CITY AND SLEW THE PEOPLE MUCH RICH PLUNDER THEY TOOK BUT ERE THEY COULD RETURN TO THEIR SHIPS
OF HIS ESCAPE OF THE TERRIBLE STORM THAT SHATTERED HIS RAFT AND OF HOW AT LENGTH HE REACHED THE SHORE AND MET WITH NAUSICAA IT WAS WRONG OF MY DAUGHTER NOT TO BRING THEE TO THE PALACE WHEN SHE CAME WITH HER MAIDS SAID THE KING
JASON HAD PERSUADED ORPHEUS TO ACCOMPANY THE ARGONAUTS WHEN THEY WENT TO FETCH BACK THE GOLDEN FLEECE FOR HE KNEW THAT THE PERILS OF THE WAY WOULD BE LIGHTENED BY SONG TO THE SOUND OF HIS LYRE THE ARGO HAD FLOATED DOWN TO THE SEA
TO FREY THE SHIP WAS GIVEN AND THOUGH IT WAS SO SMALL THAT IT COULD BE FOLDED AND CARRIED IN HIS POCKET WHEN IT WAS PLACED UPON THE WAVES IT WOULD GROW LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD AN ARMY OF WARRIORS WITH ALL THEIR WAR GEAR BESIDES AS SOON AS THE SAILS WERE HOISTED
TO KNOW THAT HIS MAJESTY WOULD NOT GO BACK FROM HIS THREAT AMONG OTHER THINGS HE ADVISED HIS SON TO TRAVEL FOR A TIME UNTIL THE KING'S ANGER SHOULD HAVE SOMEWHAT COOLED THE YOUNG FELLOW WHO WAS BOTH CLEVER AND HANDSOME
SPARING NEITHER TOWER NOR TOWN MAN WOMAN NOR CHILD BUT DESTROYING ALL THAT CAME IN HIS PATH FIGHT HOW THEY MIGHT THE ENGLISH COULD NOT DRIVE OUT THE DANES NOW THEY WERE IN DEEP DESPAIR
PUTTING OFF HIS ARMOR HE DRESSED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN HIS PILGRIM'S ROBE AND WITH HIS STAFF IN HIS HAND SET OUT AGAIN UPON HIS JOURNEY
AND OF MEN WHO HELD IN THEIR HANDS LIGHTED TORCHES OUTSIDE THE COURTYARD WAS A GREAT GARDEN FILLED WITH BLOSSOMING PEAR TREES AND POMEGRANATES AND APPLE TREES WITH SHINING FRUIT AND FIGS AND OLIVES
AND WOULD NOT GIVE FORTH A CHEERFUL FLAME
AND LEARNT THAT HE WAS THE MURDERER OF HIS OWN OFFSPRING HE WAS FILLED WITH HORROR AND BETOOK HIMSELF INTO EXILE SO THAT HE MIGHT HIDE HIS FACE FROM HIS FELLOW MEN AFTER A TIME HE WENT TO THE ORACLE AT DELPHI TO ASK WHAT HE SHOULD DO IN ATONEMENT FOR HIS DREADFUL DEED
BY MAKING A FISHING NET HE SPIED IN THE DISTANCE THE WHOLE COMPANY OF THE GODS APPROACHING HIS HOUSE THE SIGHT OF THEM COMING ALL TOGETHER BEAUTIFUL AND NOBLE AND FREE PIERCED LOKI WITH A PANG THAT WAS WORSE THAN DEATH
SECRET CRIMES MANIFEST THEMSELVES BY MEANS OF FEAR THUS THINKING HE PASSED THE NIGHT HAPPILY IN THE CHAMBER AND IN THE MORNING
I WOULD THAT MY HUSBAND IF EVER I HAVE ONE SHOULD BE AS HE THEN SHE AND HER MAIDENS BROUGHT HIM FOOD AND WINE AND HE ATE HUNGRILY FOR IT WAS MANY DAYS SINCE HE HAD EATEN
AND HE KNEW THAT IT CAME FROM THE EYE OF ODIN WHO WAS WATCHING HIM FROM AIR THRONE THEN HE TRIED TO ESCAPE THE WATCHFUL EYE BY DISGUISING HIMSELF UNDER VARIOUS SHAPES SOMETIMES HE WAS AN EAGLE ON A LONELY MOUNTAIN CRAG
BUT SHE REMEMBERED THAT THE GOOD FAIRIES HAD PROMISED TO SEND HER A LITTLE SON AND SO SHE MADE UP HER MIND TO LIVE UNTIL HE CAME WHEN THE GOOD FAIRIES BROUGHT THE BABY SHE CALLED HIM REINBROUN AND HE WAS SO PRETTY AND SO DEAR
WHOM HE LOVED DEARLY AND WHO RETURNED HIS LOVE BUT AT THEIR MARRIAGE THE OMENS WERE NOT FAVORABLE HYMEN THE MARRIAGE GOD CAME TO IT WITH A GLOOMY COUNTENANCE AND THE WEDDING TORCHES SMOKED
PHYLLIS BEGGED HIM TO STAY BUT GUY SAID I MUST GO SO DRESSED IN PILGRIM ROBES WITH STAFF IN HAND HE SET OUT ON HIS LONG JOURNEY ONE DAY AS HE WALKED HE CAME UPON AN OLD MAN WHO WAS SAD
HAD THE COURAGE TO DISOBEY THIS UNLAWFUL COMMAND AND SO SAVED THE LIFE OF LYNCEUS HER HUSBAND WITH WHOM SHE FLED LATER ON LYNCEUS RETURNED AND SLEW THE CRUEL KING IN BATTLE
THE SAGE AT ONCE LIFTED UP THE FISH AND PLACED IT IN A JAR OF WATER IT GRADUALLY INCREASED IN BULK AND HE TRANSFERRED IT NEXT TO A TANK AND THEN TO THE RIVER GANGES
IN HIS DAYS THE LAND WAS QUIET TEN YEARS
SUGGESTS THAT DAGON WAS THE FERTILIZING HARVEST GOD AMONG OTHER THINGS WHOSE USEFULNESS HAD BEEN IMPAIRED AS THEY BELIEVED
MOON AND WATER WORSHIP WERE THEREFORE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED THE BLOOD OF ANIMALS AND THE SAP OF PLANTS WERE VITALIZED BY THE WATER OF LIFE AND UNDER CONTROL OF THE MOON THE BODY MOISTURE OF GODS AND DEMONS HAD VITALIZING PROPERTIES
DERIVE HIS NAME FROM THE SEMITIC DAG A FISH AND SUGGEST THAT AFTER THE IDOL FELL ONLY THE FISHY PART DAGO WAS LEFT ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS ARGUED THAT DAGON WAS A CORN GOD
AND THEREFORE UNABLE EITHER TO ASSERT ITS AUTHORITY IN JUDAH
ANOTHER BABYLONIAN DEITY NAMED DAGAN
IT IS NOT SURPRISING TO FIND THAT THE GROWTH OF RELIGIOUS MYTHS WAS NOT SO SPONTANEOUS IN EARLY CIVILIZATIONS OF THE HIGHEST ORDER AS HAS HITHERTO BEEN ASSUMED IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT IN EACH GREAT LOCAL MYTHOLOGY
THE BESTOWER OF BLESSINGS SKILFUL ENGINEERS HAD SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF WATER DISTRIBUTION BY IRRIGATING SUN PARCHED AREAS AND PREVENTING THE EXCESSIVE FLOODING OF THOSE DISTRICTS WHICH ARE NOW RENDERED IMPASSABLE SWAMPS WHEN THE RIVERS OVERFLOW
EVIL SPIRITS ACCORDING TO A BABYLONIAN CHANT WERE THE BITTER VENOM OF THE GODS THOSE ATTACHED TO A DEITY AS ATTENDANTS APPEAR TO REPRESENT THE ORIGINAL ANIMISTIC GROUP FROM WHICH HE EVOLVED
SHALMANESER SHAMASH ADAD ASHUR DAN
AND SAID TREASON TREASON THEN JEHOIADA THE PRIEST BROUGHT OUT THE CAPTAINS OF HUNDREDS THAT WERE SET OVER THE HOST
HAD ASSERTED THEMSELVES AND EXTENDED THEIR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE THE STATE OF URARTU WAS OF GROWING IMPORTANCE AND THE NAIRI TRIBES HAD SPREAD ROUND THE SOUTH EASTERN SHORES OF LAKE VAN
ORION THE GREEK GIANT SPRANG FROM THE BODY MOISTURE OF DEITIES THE WEEPING CEREMONIES IN CONNECTION WITH AGRICULTURAL RITES WERE NO DOUBT BELIEVED TO BE OF MAGICAL POTENCY THEY ENCOURAGED THE GOD TO WEEP CREATIVE TEARS
REIGNED FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
NOT MERELY AS A PRODUCER OF CROPS HIS WORD BECAME THE CREATIVE FORCE HE NAMED THOSE THINGS HE DESIRED TO BE AND THEY CAME INTO EXISTENCE
IT MUST THEREFORE HAVE HAD A BRISK AND FLOURISHING FOREIGN TRADE AT AN EXCEEDINGLY REMOTE PERIOD NO DOUBT NUMEROUS ALIEN MERCHANTS WERE ATTRACTED TO ITS CITIES
FOR THE DEITIES WERE NOT SHARPLY DEFINED AND EXISTED IN GROUPS ENNEADS WERE FORMED IN EGYPT BY PLACING A LOCAL GOD AT THE HEAD OF A GROUP OF EIGHT ELDER DEITIES THE SUN GOD RA WAS THE CHIEF FIGURE OF THE EARLIEST PANTHEON OF THIS CHARACTER AT HELIOPOLIS
PANTHEONS NOT ONLY VARIED IN DETAIL BUT WERE PRESIDED OVER BY DIFFERENT SUPREME GODS ONE CITY'S CHIEF DEITY MIGHT BE REGARDED AS A SECONDARY DEITY AT ANOTHER CENTRE
IN THE NORTH HE HAD TO DRIVE BACK INVADING BANDS OF THE MUSKI
URARTU ANCIENT ARMENIA MITANNI
IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE COMPLEX CHARACTER OF CERTAIN DEITIES WAS DUE TO THE PROCESS OF ADJUSTMENT TO WHICH THEY WERE SUBJECTED IN NEW ENVIRONMENTS
THE BEATING OF NIMROD RECALLS THE BEATING OF THE CORN SPIRIT OF THE AGRICULTURAL LEGEND UTILIZED BY BURNS IN HIS BALLAD OF JOHN BARLEYCORN
ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE PRESENCE OF A GREAT BEAST IN SEA LOCH OR RIVER IN A CLASS OF LEGENDS SPECIALLY CONNECTED WITH THE WORSHIP OF ATARGATIS WROTE PROFESSOR ROBERTSON SMITH THE DIVINE LIFE OF THE WATERS RESIDES IN THE SACRED FISH THAT INHABIT THEM
HE TURNED NOT ASIDE FROM IT DOING THAT WHICH WAS RIGHT IN THE EYES OF THE LORD NEVERTHELESS THE HIGH PLACES WERE NOT TAKEN AWAY
THE PEOPLE OF KASHSHI BABYLONIA AND KALDU CHALDAEA WERE STRICKEN WITH TERROR AND HAD TO AGREE TO PAY INCREASED TRIBUTE
THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT THE ARABS ACQUIRED PHILOSTRATUS EXPLAINS BY EATING THE HEARTS OF DRAGONS THE ANIMALS WHO UTTER MAGIC WORDS ARE OF COURSE THE FATES SIEGFRIED OF THE NIBELUNGENLIED
JEHUA SHALMANESER DID NOT AGAIN ATTACK DAMASCUS HIS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE WAS THEREFORE CONFINED TO NORTH SYRIA
TWO YEARS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BROKEN THE POWER OF AKHUNI
FROM WHOM THEIR POWERS WERE DERIVED AND THE FAIRY LORE ABOUT SWAN MAIDS AND MEN AND THE SEALS AND OTHER ANIMALS WHO COULD DIVEST THEMSELVES OF THEIR SKIN COVERINGS AND APPEAR IN HUMAN SHAPE
ONCE UPON A TIME WE TWO BROTHERS WITH THE DESIRE OF OUTSTRIPPING EACH OTHER FLEW TOWARDS THE SUN
LORD OF HEAVEN AND EARTH SA KALAMA RULER OF THE LAND AS WELL AS ENGUR GOD OF THE ABYSS NAQBU THE DEEP
AND ABIJAH PURSUED AFTER JEROBOAM AND TOOK CITIES FROM HIM BETHEL WITH THE TOWNS THEREOF AND JESHANAH WITH THE TOWNS THEREOF
HIS REVOLT RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF THE ORTHODOX HEBREWS AND HE BEGAN WELL BY INAUGURATING REFORMS IN THE NORTHERN KINGDOM WITH PURPOSE APPARENTLY TO RE ESTABLISH THE WORSHIP OF DAVID'S GOD HE PERSECUTED THE PROPHETS OF BAAL BUT SOON BECAME A BACKSLIDER
SO THAT HE MIGHT BE THE FIRST TO ANNOUNCE THE REVOLT TO THE KING WHOM HE WAS TO DEPOSE THE WATCHMAN ON THE TOWER OF JEZREEL SAW JEHU AND HIS COMPANY APPROACHING
AND THE THEORY OBTAINED FOR A TIME
SPRINKLE THE LADY ISHTAR WITH THE WATER OF LIFE AND BID HER DEPART
IF ERIDU WAS NOT THE CRADLE OF THE SUMERIAN RACE IT WAS POSSIBLY THE CRADLE OF SUMERIAN CIVILIZATION
I FOUGHT WITH HIM SHALMANESER RECORDED AND ACCOMPLISHED HIS DEFEAT
NOWHERE REMARKS PROFESSOR JASTROW DOES A HIGH FORM OF CULTURE ARISE WITHOUT THE COMMINGLING OF DIVERSE ETHNIC ELEMENTS
AS IN THE NILE VALLEY HOWEVER IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACE IN MESOPOTAMIA THE INITIATORY STAGES OF PREHISTORIC CULTURE BASED ON THE AGRICULTURAL MODE OF LIFE
AND CARRIED WITH THEM A HERITAGE OF IMMEMORIAL BELIEFS AND CUSTOMS
PTAH MOULDED THE FIRST MAN ON HIS POTTER'S WHEEL HE ALSO MOULDED THE SUN AND MOON HE SHAPED THE UNIVERSE AND HAMMERED OUT THE COPPER SKY
EA BANI WAS ATTRACTED TO ERECH BY THE GIFT OF A FAIR WOMAN FOR WIFE THE POET WHO LAUDED HIM NO DOUBT MIRRORED PUBLIC OPINION WE CAN SEE THE SLIM SHAVEN SUMERIANS GAZING WITH WONDER AND ADMIRATION ON THEIR ROUGH HEROIC ALLY
MANY CAPTIVES I BURNED WITH FIRE MANY OF THEIR SOLDIERS I TOOK ALIVE OF SOME I CUT OFF HANDS AND LIMBS OF OTHERS THE NOSES EARS AND ARMS OF MANY SOLDIERS I PUT OUT THE EYES
FLOWED LIKE THE LETTER S TOWARDS LARSA AND THEN REJOINED THE RIVER IT IS BELIEVED TO MARK THE COURSE FOLLOWED IN THE EARLY SUMERIAN PERIOD BY THE EUPHRATES RIVER WHICH HAS MOVED STEADILY WESTWARD MANY MILES BEYOND THE SITES OF ANCIENT CITIES THAT WERE ERECTED ON ITS BANKS
ON THIS WATER TO PUT HIS PURE SPELL
HE TAUGHT THE PEOPLE HOW TO FORM AND USE ALPHABETIC SIGNS AND INSTRUCTED THEM IN MATHEMATICS HE GAVE THEM THEIR CODE OF LAWS LIKE THE EGYPTIAN ARTISAN GOD PTAH
AND THEY MAY EITHER CARRY THE HERO ON THEIR BACKS INSTRUCT HIM FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO HIS AID WHEN CALLED UPON WHEN A GREAT NATIONAL HERO APPEALED BY REASON OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS TO THE IMAGINATION OF A PEOPLE ALL THE FLOATING LEGENDS OF ANTIQUITY WERE ATTACHED TO HIS MEMORY
THE INDIAN CREATIVE GODS BRAHMA AND VISHNU HAD FISH FORMS IN SANSKRIT LITERATURE MANU THE EPONYMOUS FIRST MAN IS INSTRUCTED BY THE FISH
IN SHAPE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING A FISH IT LIES BETWEEN THE TWO GREAT RIVERS THE TIGRIS AND THE EUPHRATES ONE HUNDRED MILES WIDE AT ITS BROADEST PART
ACCUSTOMED FOR GENERATIONS TO DESERT WARFARE THEY WERE FEARLESS WARRIORS THEIR ARMIES HAD GREAT MOBILITY BEING COMPOSED MOSTLY OF MOUNTED INFANTRY AND WERE NOT EASILY OVERPOWERED BY THE ASSYRIAN FORCES OF FOOTMEN
THE GOD OF THE DEEP WAS ALSO LORD OF LIFE ENTI KING OF THE RIVER LUGAL IDA AND GOD OF CREATION NUDIMMUD
ON HIS WAY SOUTHWARD HE SUBDUED MANY VILLAGES
AFTER SLAYING THE REGIN DRAGON MAKES HIMSELF INVULNERABLE BY BATHING IN ITS BLOOD HE OBTAINS WISDOM BY EATING THE HEART AS SOON AS HE TASTES IT
THE CITY OF TELLO WAS VERY STRONG
HIS NAME SIGNIFYING THE HIGH ONE IS DERIVED FROM ANA HEAVEN HE WAS THE CITY GOD OF ERECH
THE FORMER HAD RAIDED NORTH SYRIA AND APPARENTLY PENETRATED AS FAR AS THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST IN CONSEQUENCE HE CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH BABYLONIA BUT HE ULTIMATELY FORMED AN ALLIANCE WITH THAT KINGDOM HIS SON TUKULTI NINIP
THE SACRED WATER MIGHT ALSO BE FOUND AT A CONFLUENCE OF RIVERS
WHICH ESTABLISH A RACIAL KINSHIP BETWEEN THE NEOLITHIC EUROPEANS
NO DOUBT THE CITY DWELLERS WHO WERE IMPRESSED BY THE PROWESS OF THE HAIRY AND POWERFUL WARRIORS WERE ALSO READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GREATNESS OF THEIR WAR GODS AND TO ADMIT THEM INTO THE PANTHEON THE FUSION OF BELIEFS WHICH FOLLOWED MUST HAVE STIMULATED THOUGHT
WHILE THE SUN GOD WHOSE SEMITIC NAME WAS SHAMASH PRESIDED AT LARSA AND SIPPAR OTHER DEITIES WERE SIMILARLY EXALTED IN OTHER STATES AS HAS BEEN INDICATED A MYTHOLOGICAL SYSTEM MUST HAVE BEEN STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY CITY POLITICS
WHICH JUSTIFY THE APPLICATION OF THE TERM INDIGENOUS IN THE BROAD SENSE IT IS FOUND LIKE THAT OF EGYPT TO BE POSSESSED OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS WHICH SUGGEST EXCEEDINGLY REMOTE INFLUENCES AND CONNECTIONS AT PRESENT OBSCURE
IN BABYLONIA THERE ARE TWO SEASONS THE RAINY AND THE DRY RAIN FALLS FROM NOVEMBER TILL MARCH AND THE PLAIN IS CARPETED IN SPRING BY PATCHES OF VIVID GREEN VERDURE AND BRILLIANT WILD FLOWERS
ZIMRI'S REVOLT WAS SHORTLIVED HE REIGNED ONLY SEVEN DAYS IN TIRZAH THE ARMY WAS ENCAMPED AGAINST GIBBETHON WHICH BELONGED TO THE PHILISTINES AND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ENCAMPED HEARD SAY
AND INFORMED JORAM WHO TWICE SENT OUT A MESSENGER TO ENQUIRE IS IT PEACE NEITHER MESSENGER RETURNED AND THE WATCHMAN INFORMED THE WOUNDED MONARCH OF ISRAEL HE CAME EVEN UNTO THEM AND COMETH NOT AGAIN
A NETWORK OF CANALS WAS CONSTRUCTED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHICH RESTRICTED THE DESTRUCTIVE TENDENCIES OF THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES AND DEVELOPED TO A HIGH DEGREE THEIR POTENTIALITIES AS FERTILIZING AGENCIES THE GREATEST OF THESE CANALS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN ANCIENTLY RIVER BEDS
WHEN SUMERIA WAS BEGINNING TO FLOURISH THESE TWO RIVERS HAD SEPARATE OUTLETS AND ERIDU
AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE PERIODIC AND WIDESPREAD MIGRATIONS OF PEOPLES WHO HAD ACQUIRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
THE HEAD CONVERGES TO A POINT ABOVE BASRA WHERE THE RIVERS MEET AND FORM THE SHATT EL ARAB WHICH POURS INTO THE PERSIAN GULF AFTER MEETING THE KARUN AND DRAWING AWAY THE MAIN VOLUME OF THAT DOUBLE MOUTHED RIVER
SPECIAL CHAPTERS WITH COMPARATIVE NOTES ARE DEVOTED TO THE ISHTAR TAMMUZ MYTHS THE SEMIRAMIS LEGENDS ASHUR AND HIS SYMBOLS
FROM ONE WRITES A TRAVELLER FLOWS HOT WATER BLACK WITH BITUMEN WHILE THE OTHER DISCHARGES INTERMITTENTLY BITUMEN OR AFTER A RAINSTORM BITUMEN AND COLD WATER
WOULD DEPEND GREATLY ON THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF HIS WORSHIPPERS AND THE PROGRESS OF THE CITY CIVILIZATION OVER WHICH HE PRESIDED BEL ENLIL'S FAME AS A WAR DEITY
HE WAS THE CHIEF FIGURE IN A TRIAD IN WHICH HE FIGURED AS EARTH GOD WITH ANU AS GOD OF THE SKY
HE WEPT FERTILIZING TEARS AND CORN WAS SOWN AND REAPED AMIDST LAMENTATIONS HE MAY BE IDENTICAL WITH REMI WHO WAS A PHASE OF SEBEK THE CROCODILE GOD A DEVELOPED ATTRIBUTE OF NU
A CREATURE ENDOWED WITH REASON WITH A BODY LIKE THAT OF A FISH WITH FEET BELOW LIKE THOSE OF A MAN WITH A FISH'S TAIL THIS DESCRIPTION RECALLS THE FAMILIAR FIGURES OF EGYPTIAN GODS AND PRIESTS ATTIRED IN THE SKINS OF THE SACRED ANIMALS
HIS WORSHIP WAS CERTAINLY OF GREAT ANTIQUITY HAMMURABI WRITES PROFESSOR PINCHES SEEMS TO SPEAK OF THE EUPHRATES AS BEING THE BOUNDARY OF DAGAN WHOM HE CALLS HIS CREATOR IN LATER INSCRIPTIONS THE FORM DAGUNA
FOR HE CRUSHED HIM BETWEEN TWO STONES
THE SON OF TABRIMON THE SON OF HEZION KING OF SYRIA THAT DWELT AT DAMASCUS SAYING THERE IS A LEAGUE BETWEEN ME AND THEE AND BETWEEN MY FATHER AND THY FATHER BEHOLD
OF THAT KINGDOM AND WAS THUS ABLE TO OPERATE IN THE NORTH WEST WITHOUT FEAR OF COMPLICATIONS WITH THE RIVAL CLAIMANT OF MESOPOTAMIA
WHEN THE CAPTURED ARK OF THE ISRAELITES WAS PLACED IN IT THE IMAGE OF DAGON FELL ON HIS FACE WITH THE RESULT THAT THE HEAD OF DAGON AND BOTH THE PALMS OF HIS HANDS WERE CUT OFF UPON THE THRESHOLD
HE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO RETURN WITH A GREAT ARMY BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN ACHIEVING ANY PERMANENT SUCCESS ALTHOUGH HE PUT HIS ENEMIES TO FLIGHT THE VARIOUS WESTERN KINGDOMS INCLUDING DAMASCUS ISRAEL
TO REVIVE THE SICK MAN
HIS AID WAS INVOKED BY MEANS OF MAGICAL FORMULAE AS THE GREAT MAGICIAN OF THE GODS HE UTTERED CHARMS HIMSELF AND WAS THE PATRON OF ALL MAGICIANS ONE SPELL RUNS AS FOLLOWS
HE THEN OBTAINS FROM THE BOX OF WHICH IT IS THE GUARDIAN THE BOOK OF SPELLS WHEN HE READS A PAGE OF THE SPELLS HE KNOWS WHAT THE BIRDS OF THE SKY THE FISH OF THE DEEP AND THE BEASTS OF THE HILL SAY THE BOOK GIVES HIM POWER TO ENCHANT THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH
EKE OUT PRECARIOUS LIVINGS UNDER THE OPPRESSION OF TURKISH TAX GATHERERS WHO ARE SCARCELY LESS CONSIDERATE THAN THE PLUNDERING NOMADS OF THE DESERT THIS HISTORIC COUNTRY IS BOUNDED ON THE EAST BY PERSIA AND ON THE WEST BY THE ARABIAN DESERT
CARRIED A LIGHTNING TRIDENT AND CAUSED EARTHQUAKES HE WAS A BROTHER OF ZEUS THE SKY AND ATMOSPHERE DEITY AND HAD BULL AND HORSE FORMS AS A HORSE HE PURSUED DEMETER
INDEED THESE CONSTITUTED THE BASIS OF SUMERIAN PROSPERITY CONQUERORS HAVE EVER SOUGHT REWARD NOT MERELY IN SPOIL BUT ALSO THE SERVICES OF THE CONQUERED IN NORTHERN BABYLONIA THE INVADERS APPARENTLY FOUND IT NECESSARY
BESIDES LOCAL GODS COULD NOT BE IGNORED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR POPULARITY AS A RESULT
WE SHALL FIND THESE ELDER DEMONS FIGURING IN THE BABYLONIAN CREATION MYTH WHICH RECEIVES TREATMENT IN A LATER CHAPTER THE ANCIENT SUMERIAN CITY OF ERIDU WHICH MEANS ON THE SEASHORE WAS INVESTED WITH GREAT SANCTITY FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES
AND THE TREASURES OF THE KING'S HOUSE AND DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF HIS SERVANTS
IS A WORD OF UNCERTAIN MEANING
AND THE DRIVING IS LIKE THE DRIVING OF JEHU THE SON OF NIMSHI FOR HE DRIVETH FURIOUSLY KING JORAM WENT OUT HIMSELF TO MEET THE FAMOUS CHARIOTEER
WHO HAS GIVEN A VIVID DESCRIPTION OF THE VERDANT PLAIN ON WHICH THE ANCIENT CITY WAS SITUATED AS IT APPEARED IN SPRING ITS PASTURE LANDS KNOWN AS THE JAIF ARE RENOWNED HE WROTE
THEY REFLECT THE SPIRIT OF ASSYRIA'S GREATNESS WHICH HOWEVER HAD A MATERIALISTIC BASIS ASSYRIAN ART FOUND EXPRESSION IN DELINEATING THE OUTWARD FORM RATHER THAN IN STRIVING TO CREATE A THING OF BEAUTY WHICH IS A JOY FOR EVER
OF DAMASCUS AND AHAB OF ISRAEL AKHABBU
THEY DID NOT COME DOWN OR EMBRACE MY FEET WITH BATTLE AND SLAUGHTER I ASSAULTED AND TOOK THE CITY THREE THOUSAND WARRIORS I SLEW IN BATTLE THEIR BOOTY AND POSSESSIONS CATTLE SHEEP I CARRIED AWAY
WAS GIVEN FIRST PLACE AT ERIDU AND WAS SO PRONOUNCEDLY SUMERIAN IN CHARACTER
FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY AFTER THIS DISASTER BABYLONIA WAS A PROVINCE OF ASSYRIA
WERE RIVALS FOR THE THRONE THE FORMER THE RIGHTFUL HEIR APPEALED FOR HELP TO SHALMANESER AND THAT MONARCH AT ONCE HASTENED TO ASSERT HIS AUTHORITY IN THE SOUTHERN KINGDOM
LAYARD EXCAVATED THE EMPEROR'S PALACE AND DISPATCHED TO LONDON AMONG OTHER TREASURES OF ANTIQUITY
THROUGHOUT THIS VOLUME COMPARATIVE NOTES HAVE BEEN COMPILED IN DEALING WITH MESOPOTAMIAN BELIEFS
AS THOSE HEROES HAD PREVIOUSLY DISPLACED THE HUMANIZED SPIRITS OF FERTILITY AND GROWTH WHO ALTERNATELY BATTLED FIERCELY AGAINST THE DEMONS OF SPRING MADE LOVE GORGED AND DRANK DEEP AND WENT TO SLEEP THE SLEEP OF WINTER
HE REWARDED MANKIND FOR THE SERVICES THEY RENDERED TO HIM HE WAS THEIR LEADER AND INSTRUCTOR HE ACHIEVED FOR THEM THE VICTORIES OVER THE DESTRUCTIVE FORCES OF NATURE IN BRIEF HE WAS THE DRAGON SLAYER A DISTINCTION BY THE WAY WHICH WAS ATTACHED IN LATER TIMES TO HIS SON MERODACH
RATHER THAN DAGON WITH JAH
THIS RESINOUS SUBSTANCE IS FOUND IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH IT BUBBLES UP THROUGH CREVICES OF ROCKS ON RIVER BANKS AND FORMS SMALL PONDS TWO FAMOUS SPRINGS AT MODERN HIT ON THE EUPHRATES HAVE BEEN DRAWN UPON FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL
MODES OF THOUGHT WERE THE PRODUCTS OF MODES OF LIFE AND WERE INFLUENCED IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT BY HUMAN EXPERIENCES THE INFLUENCE OF ENVIRONMENT ON THE GROWTH OF CULTURE
TERRIFIED BY THE VOICE AND THE FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE OF THE HEROES THE SHEPHERD RETREATS HURRIEDLY LOCKING THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
AND WHEN SHE WAS COME TO THE ENTERING OF THE HORSE GATE BY THE KING'S HOUSE THEY SLEW HER THERE AND JEHOIADA MADE A COVENANT BETWEEN HIM AND BETWEEN ALL THE PEOPLE
THE REFERENCE HOWEVER ACCORDING TO JASTROW IS NOT TO THE SALT OCEAN BUT THE SWEET WATERS FLOWING UNDER THE EARTH WHICH FEED THE STREAMS
AND WE DO EXPECT THAT SOME MEMBER WILL ASK A QUESTION ON THE SUBJECT IN THE HOUSE WOULD SUCH CULPABLE QUIESCENCE HAVE BEEN ALLOWED HAD NOT THE UNFORTUNATE LADY WHOSE NAME WE ARE UNWILLING TO MENTION
AND FILLED THE GALLERY WITH STRANGERS WE MAY SAY PERHAPS THAT THE HIGHEST DUTY IMPOSED UPON US AS A NATION IS THE MANAGEMENT OF INDIA
AND WITH THE PERSONAL ASSISTANCE OF OUR OLD FRIEND MAJOR MACKINTOSH WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MAN MEALYUS HAD CAUSED TO BE MADE FOR HIM IN PRAGUE A KEY WHICH WOULD OPEN THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE IN NORTHUMBERLAND STREET A KEY WAS MADE IN LONDON FROM THE MODEL NOW BROUGHT WHICH DID OPEN THE DOOR
AND TO SUBJECT THE JURY TO THE VERY GREAT INCONVENIENCE OF PROLONGED INCARCERATION FOR ANOTHER WEEK EITHER TO DO THAT OR TO CALL UPON THE JURY TO ACQUIT THE PRISONER I VENTURE TO ASSERT ON MY OWN PERIL THAT NO JURY CAN CONVICT THE PRISONER AFTER HEARING ME READ THAT WHICH I HOLD IN MY HAND
BUT YOU'LL BE AT MATCHING I DO GET A FEW DAYS AT HOME SOMETIMES YOU SEE I HAVE ESCAPED FOR THE PRESENT OR OTHERWISE YOU AND I WOULD NOT HAVE COME TO GRIEF TOGETHER IN BROUGHTON SPINNIES
TO GET ONESELF LOST BEFORE TWELVE AND THEN TO COME HOME IS A VERY DEGRADING THING
GREAT EFFORTS WERE MADE BY VARIOUS LADIES OF THE OLD WHIG PARTY TO OBTAIN OFFICIAL EMPLOYMENT FOR HIM BUT THEY WERE MADE IN VAIN MISTER GRESHAM WAS TOO WISE AND OUR ADVICE WE WILL NOT SAY WAS FOLLOWED
CONTRADICTION HE WOULD TAKE FOR SIMPLE ARGUMENT STRONG DIFFERENCE OF OPINION EVEN ON THE PART OF SUBORDINATES RECOMMENDED ITSELF TO HIM HE COULD PUT UP WITH APPARENT RUDENESS WITHOUT SEEING IT AND ALWAYS GAVE MEN CREDIT FOR GOOD INTENTIONS
AND WE ARE QUITE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF THE COUNTRY HAS THEREBY BEEN SUBJECTED TO GRIEVOUS INJURY IT IS HARDLY OUR DUTY TO PRAISE ANY OF THAT VERY AWKWARD TEAM OF HORSES WHICH MISTER GRESHAM DRIVES WITH AN AUDACITY WHICH MAY ATONE FOR HIS
THE PERSON WHOM HE NOW SAW MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MAN IN THE STREET OR MISTER FINN MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MAN OR ANY OTHER MAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MAN LORD FAWN WAS VERY DIGNIFIED VERY RESERVED AND VERY UNHAPPY TO HIS THINKING HE WAS THE GREAT MARTYR OF THIS TRIAL
HE MUST VANISH OUT OF THE WORLD
WHO HAVE BEEN AT WORK UPON THE MATTER CAREFULLY HAVE COME TO THAT CONCLUSION AND NOTHING BUT PRIVATE KNOWLEDGE OR PERSONAL AFFECTION WILL STAND AGAINST SUCH EVIDENCE AT TANKERVILLE THERE WAS NOTHING OF EITHER
HE HAD NO OTHER REMARK TO MAKE AND HE WAS SURE THAT THE HOUSE WOULD APPRECIATE THE COURSE WHICH HAD INDUCED HIM TO SEAT HIMSELF BELOW THE GANGWAY THE HOUSE CHEERED VERY LOUDLY
AND OUR HERO'S GUILT WAS TAKEN AS A CERTAINTY THERE WAS AN INTEREST FELT IN THE WHOLE MATTER WHICH WAS FULL OF EXCITEMENT AND NOT ALTOGETHER WITHOUT DELIGHT TO THE TANKERVILLIANS OF COURSE THE BOROUGH AS A BOROUGH
IT WAS ABOUT A FOOT LONG WITH A LEATHERN THONG TO THE HANDLE WITH SOMETHING OF A SPRING IN THE SHAFT AND WITH THE OVAL LOADED KNOT AT THE END CASED WITH LEATHERN THONGS VERY MINUTELY AND SKILFULLY CUT THEY WHO UNDERSTOOD MODERN WORK IN LEATHER
BUT AFTER ALL THERE'S BEEN BETWIXT YOU AND US IT WOULDN'T BE NATURAL TO PASS IT BY WITHOUT ONE WORD WOULD IT MISTER FINN WELL YES HE'S JUST THE SAME MAN AS EVER
AND KNEW ACCURATELY THE LINE WHICH HE WOULD TAKE HE HAD NOT AS YET PREPARED A WORD OF HIS SPEECH
IT WAS NOT NOW THAT HE FEARED THE TASK IMMEDIATELY BEFORE HIM BUT THAT HE WAS OVERCOME BY THE FEELING OF GENERAL FAILURE WHICH HAD COME UPON HIM OF WHAT USE WAS IT TO HIM OR TO ANY ONE ELSE THAT HE SHOULD BE THERE IN THAT ASSEMBLY
WAS ON THE TONGUE OF EVERY WOMAN IN TANKERVILLE AND A MOST DELIGHTFUL ROMANCE WAS COMPOSED SOME FEW PROTESTANT SPIRITS REGRETTED THE NOW ASSURED ESCAPE OF THEIR ROMAN CATHOLIC ENEMY AND WOULD NOT EVEN YET ALLOW THEMSELVES TO DOUBT
BUT I AM NOT IN A CONDITION AT PRESENT EITHER OF MIND OR BODY TO PUT MYSELF FORWARD ANYWHERE IN PUBLIC I HAVE SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL MOST CRUEL SAID TRODDLES AND AM QUITE WILLING TO CONFESS
AN ACCUSATION AS TO WHICH HAD BEEN MADE AGAINST HIM SO INJURIOUSLY BY MISTER BONTEEN HE HIMSELF HE SAID HAD BEEN CALLED IMPRACTICAL AND PERHAPS HE MIGHT ALLUDE TO A VOTE WHICH HE HAD GIVEN IN THAT HOUSE WHEN LAST HE HAD THE HONOUR OF SITTING THERE
THERE IS NO ONE WHOM I CAN ASK TO TELL ME OF HIM THAT HE DID NOT ATTEND DURING THE LAST SESSION I DO KNOW AND WE PRESUME THAT HE HAS NOW ABANDONED HIS SEAT I FEAR THAT HIS HEALTH IS BAD
I SHAN'T BE VERY LONG SAID PHINEAS NOT ABOVE TWENTY MINUTES I SHOULD THINK HE WAS ABLE TO ASSUME AN AIR OF INDIFFERENCE AND YET AT THE MOMENT HE HEARTILY WISHED HIMSELF BACK IN DUBLIN
RATLER HIMSELF ALMOST FELT THAT HE LOVED THE CHURCH ONLY TWO RESIGNATIONS WHEREAS IT HAD BEEN EXPECTED THAT THE WHOLE HOUSE WOULD FALL TO PIECES WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT THESE EARLS
MISTER RUDDLES WAS AT ONCE DESPATCHED TO LONDON WITH TWO OTHER POLITICAL SPIRITS SO THAT THERE MIGHT BE A REAL DEPUTATION AND WAITED UPON PHINEAS TWO DAYS AFTER HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON
WITH THE VIEW OF DECLARING HOW IMPROPER IT WOULD BE SHOULD A NEWSPAPER EXPRESS ANY OPINION OF THE GUILT OR INNOCENCE OF A SUSPECTED PERSON WHILE UNDER TRIAL AND HE GAVE TWO OR THREE SEVERE BLOWS TO CONTEMPORARIES FOR HAVING SINNED IN THE MATTER
NOW THIS RIGHT HONOURABLE GENTLEMAN HAD NEVER BEEN SPECIALLY SERVICEABLE BUT THE WONDER OF THE WORLD AROSE FROM THE FACT THAT ONLY TWO GENTLEMEN OUT OF THE TWENTY OR THIRTY WHO COMPOSED THE GOVERNMENT
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT I AM GUILTY OF THROWING THE FIRST STONE SAID PHINEAS THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING STONES AT THE TEMPLE SINCE FIRST IT WAS BUILT SAID MISSUS LOW WITH ENERGY BUT THEY HAVE FALLEN OFF ITS POLISHED SHAFTS IN DUST AND FRAGMENTS
THE DUKE'S PROPERTY INDEED SURELY ALL THAT WAS UNDERSTOOD IN ENGLAND BY THIS TIME NOW HE HAD CONSENTED TO COME TO MATCHING BRINGING HIS WIFE WITH HIM IN ORDER THAT THE MATTER MIGHT BE SETTLED THERE HAD BEEN A THREAT THAT HE WOULD GIVE UP THE COUNTRY
BUT ON THIS OCCASION THERE WAS NO FAILURE THAT SENSE OF AWE FROM THE SURROUNDING CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MOMENT WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN HEAVY ON HIM AND WHICH HE STILL WELL REMEMBERED HAD BEEN OVERCOME AND HAD NEVER RETURNED TO HIM
AND THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL BE AFFLICTED WITH A WILD DISMAY ALL WHICH LORD CHILTERN UNDERSTOOD WELL WHEN HE BECAME SO LOUD IN HIS COMPLAINT AGAINST THE DUKE BUT OUR DEAR OLD FRIEND ONLY THE OTHER DAY A DUKE PLANTY PALL AS HE WAS LATELY CALLED
DON'T YOU SEE THAT THOUGH YOU HAVE BEEN KNOCKED ABOUT A LITTLE LATELY BY GEORGE HE HAS MOST CRUEL SAID TRODDLES YOU'LL MISS THE HOUSE IF YOU GIVE IT UP YOU WILL AFTER A BIT MISTER FINN YOU'VE GOT TO COME ROUND AGAIN MISTER FINN
WHEN PHINEAS EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD THROWN UP HIS PLACE AND THEN THEY SETTLED DOWN ON THE QUESTION OF THE DAY AND SO SAID MISSUS LOW YOU'VE BEGUN TO ATTACK THE CHURCH IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT AT THIS MOMENT MISTER DAUBENY
LADY GLENCORA AT SUCH A TIME WOULD HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO AND I MUST BE THERE OR GATHERUM CASTLE SHOULD NOT BE OPENED I SUGGESTED WHETHER I COULD NOT REMAIN IN THE BACKGROUND AND LOOK AFTER THE DUKE AS A KIND OF UPPER NURSE BUT LADY GLENCORA SAID IT WOULD NOT DO
BY SENDING A ROMAN CATHOLIC TO PARLIAMENT AND HAD DONE SO AT THE VERY MOMENT IN WHICH THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND WAS BEING BROUGHT INTO DANGER THIS WAS WHAT HAD COME UPON THE BOROUGH BY NOT STICKING TO HONEST MISTER BROWBOROUGH THERE WAS A MOMENT
AS FOR GOING BACK TO DUBLIN THAT WAS NOW OUT OF THE QUESTION HE HAD ENTERED UPON A FEVERISH STATE OF EXISTENCE IN WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD LIVE IN IRELAND
HOLDING HIS VEXATION WITHIN HIS OWN BOSOM HE WAS DARK AND SULLEN TO HIS CHIEF AND ALMOST INSOLENT TO THE DUKE OF OMNIUM OUR OLD FRIEND PLANTAGENET PALLISER WAS A MAN WHO HARDLY KNEW INSOLENCE WHEN HE MET IT
WHEN THE LITTLE DOG SNARLS THE BIG DOG DOES NOT CONNECT THE SNARL WITH HIMSELF SIMPLY FANCYING THAT THE LITTLE DOG MUST BE UNCOMFORTABLE MISTER BONTEEN SNARLED A GOOD DEAL AND THE NEW LORD PRIVY SEAL THOUGHT THAT THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE
OR AT THE VERY LEAST APPOINT HIM SECRETARY TO SOMETHING I DO WISH PLANTAGENET HADN'T BEEN IN SUCH A HURRY ABOUT THAT NASTY BOARD OF TRADE AND THEN HE MIGHT HAVE GONE THERE HE COULDN'T VERY WELL BE PRIVY SEAL UNLESS THEY DO MAKE HIM A PEER YOU WOULDN'T MIND WOULD YOU MY DEAR
THAT HE SHOULD BE BEHELD BY COMMON EYES THEY NEVER EVEN EXPRESSED AN IDEA THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE COME ALLUDING EVEN TO THEIR PAST CONVICTIONS
SAID MADAME GOESLER SLOWLY YOU SEE MISTER FINN THAT YOU AS A YOUNG MAN CAN HARDLY UNDERSTAND HOW NATURAL IT IS THAT A YOUNG WOMAN IF I MAY CALL MYSELF YOUNG SHOULD MINISTER TO AN OLD MAN
AS IS A CAPACITY FOR SPEAKING FOR THREE HOURS TO THE REPORTERS AND TO THE REPORTERS ONLY A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION FOR AN UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA PHINEAS HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF THE TEMPER OF THE MOMENT IN A HOUSE THOROUGHLY CROWDED
NOT LONG SINCE A GENTLEMAN SHOT A FOX RUNNING ACROSS A WOODLAND RIDE IN A HUNTING COUNTRY HE HAD MISTAKEN IT FOR A HARE AND HAD DONE THE DEED IN THE PRESENCE OF KEEPERS OWNER AND FRIENDS
BUT OF HER INSIDE LIFE OF HER BABY OR OF HER HUSBAND AS A HUSBAND SHE NEVER SAYS A WORD YOU WILL HAVE SEEN IT ALL AND HAVE ENOUGH OF THE FEMININE SIDE OF A MAN'S CHARACTER TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME HOW THEY ARE LIVING
THEY HAVE NOT EXPECTED RELIEF FROM THE HANDS OF GREEKS BUT WILL TAKE IT WHEN IT COMES FROM GREEKS OR TROJANS WHAT WOULD MISTER TURNBULL SAY IN THIS DEBATE AND WHAT MISTER MONK MISTER TURNBULL WAS THE PEOPLE'S TRIBUNE
I SUPPOSE THEY HAVE AT ANY RATE I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD MAKE SOME EXCUSE FOR ME BUT I DO LIKE THE MAN HE IS GRACIOUS AND NOBLE IN HIS BEARING
THIS SECOND BLUDGEON WOULD NO DOUBT HELP TO REMOVE THE DIFFICULTY IN REGARD TO PHINEAS BUT WOULD NOT GIVE ATONEMENT TO THE SHADE OF MISTER BONTEEN MEALYUS WAS CONFRONTED WITH THE WEAPON IN THE PRESENCE OF MAJOR MACKINTOSH
AND WE MAY ALSO SAY THAT IN A GREAT NATIONAL ASSEMBLY PERSONAL SQUABBLING AMONG ITS MEMBERS IS THE LEAST DIGNIFIED WORK IN WHICH IT CAN EMPLOY ITSELF BUT THE PROSPECT OF AN EXPLANATION OR OTHERWISE OF A FIGHT
DISCUSSING MISTER DAUBENY'S WONDERFUL TREACHERY WITH SUCH MEN AS CAME UP TO TOWN AND WAITING FOR THE MEETING OF PARLIAMENT WHEN HE RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM LADY LAURA KENNEDY DRESDEN NOVEMBER EIGHTEENTH
THE TIME FOR IT HAD CLEARLY GONE BY THE CHURCH AS A CHURCH WOULD OWN INCREASED POWER WHEN IT COULD APPOINT ITS OWN BISHOPS AND BE WHOLLY DISSEVERED FROM STATE PATRONAGE
AND THE GENTLEMEN ASSEMBLED MEMBERS AND STRANGERS TOGETHER PASSED A PLEASANT EVENING BEFORE HE SAT DOWN PHINEAS MADE ONE ALLUSION TO THAT FORMER SCUTTLING OF THE SHIP
HE HAD BROUGHT HIS TELEGRAM DIRECT TO THE OLD BAILEY AND THE CHIEF JUSTICE NOW HELD IT IN HIS HAND
HE LOOKED ROUND THE HOUSE AND SAW LORD CANTRIP IN THE PEERS GALLERY ALAS OF WHAT AVAIL WAS THAT HE HAD ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO BIND TO HIM INDIVIDUALS WITH WHOM HE HAD BEEN BROUGHT INTO CLOSE CONTACT
OF COURSE YOU'LL COME YOU OWE IT TO US TO COME AND MAY I SAY THIS IF THERE BE ANYBODY TO COME WITH YOU THAT WILL MAKE IT ONLY SO MUCH THE BETTER IF IT SHOULD BE SO OF COURSE THERE WILL BE LETTERS WRITTEN
DIM IDEAS OF A DEFINITION OF POLITICAL HONESTY CROSSED HIS BRAIN BRINGING WITH HIM HOWEVER A CONVICTION THAT HIS THOUGHT MUST BE MUCH MORE CLEARLY WORKED OUT THAN IT COULD BE ON THAT DAY
I REMEMBER IT WELL I WAS THERE AND FIRST MADE THE DUKE'S ACQUAINTANCE ON THAT OCCASION I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS THAT WE BECAME INTIMATE BUT WE DID AND THEN I FORMED A SORT OF FRIENDSHIP WITH LADY GLENCORA
THAT NO CONSIDERATION SHOULD AT PRESENT TAKE HIM TO TANKERVILLE WE AIN'T GOING TO CHARGE YOU NOT ONE PENNY SAID MISTER GADMIRE WITH ENTHUSIASM I FEEL ALL THAT I OWE TO THE BOROUGH SAID PHINEAS AND TO THE WARM FRIENDS THERE WHO HAVE ESPOUSED MY CAUSE
TO RETURN TO THAT OBSCURITY WHICH HE SEEMS TO HAVE DESIRED THE ELECTORS OF TANKERVILLE HOWEVER ARE RESPONSIBLE ONLY TO THEIR BOROUGH AND MAY DO AS THEY PLEASE WITH THE SEAT IN PARLIAMENT WHICH IS AT THEIR DISPOSAL
THE NEWS CONVEYED BY THE TELEGRAMS WAS AT TANKERVILLE ALMOST AS SOON AS IN THE COURT AT THE OLD BAILEY AND WAS BELIEVED AS READILY THE NAME OF THE LADY WHO HAD TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY TO BOHEMIA ON BEHALF OF THEIR HANDSOME YOUNG MEMBER
BUT SUCH WORSHIP WILL NOT SUPPORT POWER WITHIN THE THREE DAYS FOLLOWING THE DIVISION THE RATLERS HAD ALL PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND HAD RESOLVED THAT THE DUKE OF SAINT BUNGAY WAS NOW THE ONLY MAN WHO COULD KEEP THE PARTY TOGETHER
WE ARE FAR FROM IMPUTING EVIL MOTIVES OR EVEN INDISCRETION TO THAT FUNCTIONARY BUT WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THE MORAL FEELING OF THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED BY THE PUBLICATION
WHY SHOULD YOU SUBJECT YOURSELF TO SUCH INDIGNITY SIMPLY FROM LOVE OF THE MAN BUT YOU SEE I WAS NOT SUBJECTED FOR TWO DAYS I WORE MY JEWELS BENEATH ROYAL EYES EYES THAT WILL SOONER OR LATER BELONG TO ABSOLUTE MAJESTY
AT HOME AS YOU KNOW NOT ONLY DID HE TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS BUT HE WAS ACTIVE ALSO IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS OWN PROPERTY NOW IT SEEMS TO HIM TO BE ALMOST TOO GREAT A TROUBLE TO WRITE A LETTER TO HIS STEWARD
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME MISTER FINN I DON'T SEE THAT THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY USED TO BE THEY TELL ME AT THE PEOPLE'S BANNER OFFICE THAT THE LORDS HAVE HAD AS MUCH TO DO WITH THIS ELECTION AS WITH ANY THAT EVER WENT BEFORE IT
I NEEDN'T SIT FOR THE BOROUGH UNLESS I PLEASE I SUPPOSE PLEADED PHINEAS WELL NO AT LEAST I DON'T KNOW SAID RUDDLES IT WOULD BE THROWING US OVER A GOOD DEAL AND I'M SURE YOU ARE NOT THE GENTLEMAN TO DO THAT AND THEN MISTER FINN
UPON THIS HE WAS HOOTED AT FROM THE OTHER SIDE WITH MANY GESTURES OF INDIGNANT DENIAL AND WAS OF COURSE EQUALLY CHEERED BY THOSE AROUND HIM SUCH INTERRUPTIONS ARE NEW BREATH TO THE NOSTRILS OF ALL ORATORS
WOULD RECEIVE THE BULK OF WHAT WAS LEFT AFTER EXISTING INTERESTS HAD BEEN AMPLY GUARANTEED THERE WOULD BE NO DOUBT SO SAID THESE GENTLEMEN THAT AMPLE FUNDS FOR THE SUPPORT OF AN EPISCOPAL CHURCH
THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO LONGER THAT STURDY ADHERENCE TO THEIR CHIEF WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE SOLIDARITY OF A PARTY PERHAPS NO LEADER OF THE HOUSE WAS EVER MORE DEVOUTLY WORSHIPPED BY A SMALL NUMBER OF ADHERENTS THAN WAS MISTER GRESHAM NOW
BUT ALSO BY THE PREVIOUS CONDUCT OF THAT GENTLEMAN BUT WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE LATE MEMBER SHOULD BE THOUGHT BY THE ELECTORS OF TANKERVILLE TO BE ESPECIALLY WORTHY OF THEIR CONFIDENCE BECAUSE HE DID NOT MURDER MISTER BONTEEN
HE HAD SEEN A MAN IN A GREY COAT AND FOR THE FUTURE WOULD CONFINE HIMSELF TO THAT YOU DID NOT SEE ME MY LORD SAID MISTER EMILIUS WITH TOUCHING SIMPLICITY
JUST BEFORE THE TRIAL WAS BEGUN IN WHICH A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE ELECTORS WAS DESIROUS OF PROCEEDING TO WORK AT ONCE AND OF SENDING MISTER BROWBOROUGH BACK TO HIS OWN PLACE IT WAS THOUGHT THAT PHINEAS FINN SHOULD BE MADE TO RESIGN
IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE MISTER BONTEEN IN HIS TROUBLED SPIRIT CERTAINLY DID MISBEHAVE HIMSELF AMONG HIS CLOSER FRIENDS HE DECLARED VERY LOUDLY THAT HE DIDN'T MEAN TO STAND IT
IN THE PURSUIT OF WHICH HE FINDS NO SPORT HIMSELF AND WHICH ARE HIGHLY DETRIMENTAL TO ANOTHER SPORT IN WHICH HE TAKES PERHAPS THE KEENEST INTEREST TRUMPETON WOOD WAS THE DUKE'S OWN TO DO JUST AS HE PLEASED WITH IT WHY SHOULD FOXES BE DEMANDED FROM HIM THEN
WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN AWFUL I DO NOT SEE HOW YOU ARE TO HELP BECOMING MAN AND WIFE NOW FOR ALL THE WORLD ARE TALKING ABOUT YOU
AND HOW WOULD THIS NEW INFORMATION HAVE BEEN RECEIVED HAD LORD FAWN SWORN UNRESERVEDLY THAT THE MAN HE HAD SEEN RUNNING OUT OF THE MEWS HAD BEEN PHINEAS FINN IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE LATCH KEY COULD NOT BE ACCEPTED AS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AGAINST MEALYUS
AND PHINEAS HAD FELT THAT IN ANY EMERGENCY HE COULD TELL HIS FRIEND ALL HIS HOPES AND FEARS BUT NOW HE DID NOT SAY A WORD OF HIS POSITION NOR DID LORD CANTRIP ALLUDE TO IT THEY WERE TO MEET ON THE MORROW IN ORDER THAT LORD CANTRIP MIGHT READ THE CORRESPONDENCE
FOR A SECOND TIME HE WAS ATTEMPTING TO EARN HIS BREAD AT HALF PAST FOUR HE WAS ON HIS LEGS IN THE MIDST OF A CROWDED HOUSE THE CHANCE PERHAPS THE HOPE OF SOME SUCH ENCOUNTER AS THAT OF THE FORMER DAY BROUGHT MEMBERS INTO THEIR SEATS
THEN A MOST IRREGULAR WORD WAS SPOKEN ONE OF THE JURYMEN DECLARED THAT HE WAS QUITE WILLING TO BELIEVE THE TELEGRAM EVERY ONE BELIEVES IT SAID MISTER CHAFFANBRASS THEN THE CHIEF JUSTICE SCOLDED THE JURYMAN AND SIR GREGORY GROGRAM SCOLDED MISTER CHAFFANBRASS
IT SEEMED THAT EVERYBODY WAS TALKING AND MISTER WICKERBY THE ATTORNEY TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT ALL TO THE PRISONER OVER THE BAR OF THE DOCK
AMONG A FEW OTHER REMARKS WHICH MISTER SLIDE THREW TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING APPEARED IN THE COLUMNS OF THE PEOPLE'S BANNER WE MUST CONFESS THAT WE HARDLY UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH MISTER FINN HAS BEEN RE ELECTED FOR TANKERVILLE
WHO REGARDED MISTER MONK AS THE HONESTEST AND MOST PATRIOTIC POLITICIAN OF THE DAY THE DEBATE WAS LONG AND STORMY BUT WAS PECULIARLY MEMORABLE FOR THE SKILL WITH WHICH MISTER DAUBENY'S HIGHER COLLEAGUES DEFENDED THE STEPS THEY WERE ABOUT TO TAKE
ARE NECESSARY TO THE MAINTENANCE OF A GREAT ARISTOCRACY HE HAS HAD THE POWER OF MAKING THE WORLD BELIEVE IN HIM SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN RICH AND A DUKE HIS NEPHEW WHEN HE COMES TO THE TITLE
BUT WAS FOUND TO AGREE WITH THE DECISION OF THE PRIME MINISTER MISTER FINN WAS LEFT OUT IN THE COLD IN SPITE OF HIS GREAT FRIENDS AND THEN CAME THE MURDER OF MISTER BONTEEN CAN IT BE THAT MISTER FINN'S FITNESS FOR PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES
HOW IT WAS FOUND IN THE NOBLEMAN'S GARDEN BY THE LITTLE BOY AT THE FIRST MOMENT WITH INSTANT READINESS HE TOOK THE THING IN HIS HAND AND LOOKED AT IT WITH FEIGNED CURIOSITY
WHEN THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN WOULD HE BE ABLE TO INSERT THE POINT AGAIN BETWEEN THOSE TWO DIFFICULT SHELLS WOULD THE COUNTESSES ONCE MORE BE KIND TO HIM WOULD DRAWING ROOMS BE OPENED TO HIM AND SOMETIMES OPENED TO HIM AND TO NO OTHER
AND TRUMPETON WOOD SHALL ONCE AGAIN BE THE GLORY OF THE BRAKE HUNT
BUT SPOKE OF HIM AS A PERSONAGE MADE ALMOST SACRED BY THE SUFFERINGS WHICH HE HAD BEEN MADE TO ENDURE AS TO THE ELECTION THAT WOULD BE A MATTER OF COURSE
HE CHOSE SIR WILLIAM DEVENANT AN INGENIOUS POET FOR HIS LIEUTENANT GENERAL THE OTHER PERSONS IN WHOM HE PLACED CONFIDENCE WERE MORE THE INSTRUMENTS OF HIS REFINED PLEASURES THAN QUALIFIED FOR THE BUSINESS WHICH THEY UNDERTOOK
A CESSATION OF ARMS WITH THE COUNCIL OF KILKENNY BY WHOM THE IRISH WERE GOVERNED AND TO LEAVE BOTH SIDES IN POSSESSION OF THEIR PRESENT ADVANTAGES THE PARLIAMENT WHOSE BUSINESS IT WAS TO FIND FAULT WITH EVERY MEASURE ADOPTED BY THE OPPOSITE PARTY
NEAR THE MOIETY TOO OF THE LOWER HOUSE ABSENTED THEMSELVES FROM COUNSELS WHICH THEY DEEMED SO FULL OF DANGER THE COMMONS SENT UP AN IMPEACHMENT AGAINST NINE PEERS FOR DESERTING THEIR DUTY IN PARLIAMENT
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY SUCCEEDED BEYOND THEIR FONDEST WISHES CHARLES WAS ENRAGED TO FIND THAT ALL HIS CONCESSIONS BUT INCREASED THEIR DEMANDS
AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE DETERMINED TO ENGAGE ENGLAND IN A WAR WITH THAT KINGDOM HE FIRST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME QUARRELS EXCITED BY THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND'S ATTENDANTS AND HE PERSUADED CHARLES TO DISMISS AT ONCE ALL HER FRENCH SERVANTS
HAD ARRIVED AT OXFORD AND HAD BROUGHT FROM THE NORTH A REENFORCEMENT OF THREE THOUSAND FOOT AND FIFTEEN HUNDRED HORSE DISLODGING FROM THAME AND AYLESBURY WHERE HE HAD HITHERTO LAIN HE THOUGHT PROPER TO RETREAT NEARER TO LONDON
DIED AT WEXFORD AND CROMWELL HAD SO FAR ADVANCED WITH HIS DECAYED ARMY THAT HE BEGAN TO FIND IT DIFFICULT EITHER TO SUBSIST IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY
OF INVADING THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT OF CHURCH AND STATE IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT THEIR PROCEEDINGS IN SUCH A VIOLENT ATTEMPT WOULD THENCEFORTH BE ALTOGETHER REGULAR AND EQUITABLE BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT
BUT SO RIVETTED THROUGHOUT THE NATION WERE THE PREJUDICES WITH REGARD TO SPANISH DECEIT AND FALSEHOOD THAT VERY FEW OF THE COMMONS SEEM AS YET TO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SEDUCED BY BUCKINGHAM'S NARRATIVE
HE INFORMED PRINCE RUPERT OF THE LOOSE DISPOSITION OF THE ENEMY'S QUARTERS AND EXHORTED HIM TO FORM SOME ATTEMPT UPON THEM THE PRINCE WHO WAS ENTIRELY FITTED FOR THAT KIND OF SERVICE FALLING SUDDENLY UPON THE DISPERSED BODIES OF ESSEX'S ARMY
WITH THE TERRORS OF INVASION WITH THE DREAD OF ENGLISH AND IRISH PAPISTS AND THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE PANICS WERE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE NATION LORD DIGBY HAVING ENTERED KINGSTON IN A COACH AND SIX
AND IT BECAME PRUDENT IN THE KING IF NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO EMBRACE SOME EXPEDIENT WHICH MIGHT SECURE THEM FOR A TIME FROM THE RUIN AND MISERY WITH WHICH THEY WERE THREATENED ACCORDINGLY THE KING GAVE ORDERS TO ORMOND AND THE JUSTICES TO CONCLUDE FOR A YEAR
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SET BOUNDS TO THESE HOLY FERVORS OR CONFINE WITHIN ANY NATURAL LIMITS WHAT WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS AN INFINITE AND A SUPERNATURAL OBJECT EVERY MAN AS PROMPTED BY THE WARMTH OF HIS TEMPER
HE EMPLOYED ALL THE ADVANTAGES WHICH REMAINED TO HIM AND ROUSED UP HIS ADHERENTS TO ARMS THE RESOURCES OF THIS PRINCE'S GENIUS INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
THAT THE KING MIGHT DESPAIR OF ALL COMPOSITION
UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THEY PRETENDED BY A VERBAL CRITICISM ON THE TENSE OF A LATIN VERB TO RAVISH FROM THE KING HIS NEGATIVE VOICE IN THE LEGISLATURE
WAS OBLIGED AGAIN TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A PARLIAMENT THOUGH THE ILL SUCCESS OF HIS ENTERPRISES DIMINISHED HIS AUTHORITY AND SHOWED EVERY DAY MORE PLAINLY THE IMPRUDENCE OF THE SPANISH WAR THOUGH THE INCREASE OF HIS NECESSITIES
PROFESSED TO ADHERE BY THEIR MEANS THE WAR WAS STILL KEPT ALIVE BUT AS THE DANGEROUS DISTRACTIONS IN ENGLAND HINDERED THE PARLIAMENT FROM SENDING ANY CONSIDERABLE ASSISTANCE TO THEIR ALLIES IN IRELAND THE MARQUIS OF ORMOND LORD LIEUTENANT
AS OF TENDERNESS AND PANEGYRIC IN HIS POETRY HE CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF HIS HEARERS AND EXERTED THE UTMOST BOLDNESS IN BLAMING THOSE VIOLENT COUNSELS BY WHICH THE COMMONS WERE GOVERNED FINDING ALL OPPOSITION WITHIN DOORS TO BE FRUITLESS HE ENDEAVORED TO FORM A PARTY WITHOUT
THE RAPID PROGRESS OF THE ROYALISTS THREATENED THE PARLIAMENT WITH IMMEDIATE SUBJECTION THE FACTIONS AND DISCONTENTS AMONG THEMSELVES IN THE CITY AND THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORING COUNTIES PROGNOSTICATED SOME DANGEROUS DIVISION OR INSURRECTION
BUT SURELY WAS NEVER BEFORE ATTEMPTED IN OPPOSITION TO A FACTION DURING THE FULL TIDE OF ITS POWER AND SUCCESS BUT MEN HAD NOT LEISURE TO WONDER AT THE INDISCRETION OF THIS MEASURE
THE KING AS HE HAD NEITHER MONEY ARMS AMMUNITION NOR PROVISIONS TO SPARE FROM HIS OWN URGENT WANTS RESOLVED TO EMBRACE AN EXPEDIENT WHICH MIGHT AT ONCE RELIEVE THE NECESSITIES OF THE IRISH PROTESTANTS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS AFFAIRS IN ENGLAND
AND FOR A LONG TIME RENT THE PARLIAMENT AND CITY INTO FACTIONS BUT AT LAST BY THE PREVALENCE OF ENVY WITH SOME WITH OTHERS OF FALSE MODESTY WITH A GREAT MANY OF THE REPUBLICAN AND INDEPENDENT VIEWS IT PASSED THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND WAS SENT TO THE UPPER HOUSE
HE HAD HEARKENED TO THE DISCOURSE OF CERTAIN PERSONS UNKNOWN TO HIM AND HAD HEARD THEM TALK OF A MOST DANGEROUS CONSPIRACY A HUNDRED AND EIGHT RUFFIANS AS HE LEARNED HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO MURDER A HUNDRED AND EIGHT LORDS AND COMMONERS
AS TO COMMAND THEIR OBEDIENCE BY WHAT WAS GREAT DARING AND ENTERPRISING FAMILIAR EVEN TO BUFFOONERY WITH THE MEANEST SENTINEL HE NEVER LOST HIS AUTHORITY
THE SUPPLY WAS ONLY VOTED BY THE COMMONS THE PASSING OF THAT VOTE INTO A LAW WAS RESERVED TILL THE END OF THE SESSION A CONDITION WAS THEREBY MADE IN A VERY UNDISGUISED MANNER WITH THEIR SOVEREIGN
TERRIFIED WITH THE PROSPECT OF RENEWING HIS PAINS AND FATIGUE HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO MAINTAIN THE FEW RESOURCES WHICH REMAINED TO A DESPERATE CAUSE AND THOUGHT THAT THE SAME REGARD TO HONOR WHICH HAD AT FIRST CALLED HIM TO ARMS
HOW COULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE CONSIDERED AS TREASON AFTER THE ACT OF OBLIVION WHICH HAD PASSED AND AFTER THAT BOTH HOUSES WITH THE KING'S CONCURRENCE HAD VOTED THAT NATION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THEIR BROTHERLY ASSISTANCE
THE LAST PARLIAMENT OF JAMES AMIDST ALL THEIR JOY AND FESTIVITY HAD GIVEN HIM A SUPPLY VERY DISPROPORTIONED TO HIS DEMAND AND TO THE OCCASION AND AS EVERY HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH WAS ELECTED DURING FORTY YEARS
THOSE PARLIAMENTARY LEADERS IT MUST BE OWNED WHO HAD INTRODUCED SUCH MIGHTY INNOVATIONS INTO THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION AND WHO HAD PROJECTED SO MUCH GREATER HAD NOT ENGAGED IN AN ENTERPRISE WHICH EXCEEDED THEIR COURAGE AND CAPACITY
THEIR OWN MEMBERS ALSO WHO SHOULD RETURN TO THEM THEY VOTED NOT TO ADMIT TILL SATISFIED CONCERNING THE REASON OF THEIR ABSENCE CHARLES MADE A DECLARATION TO THE PEERS WHO ATTENDED HIM
HAS THE SAME AUTHORITY AS A PARLIAMENT IN RAISING MONEY AND LEVYING FORCES HAMILTON AND HIS BROTHER THE EARL OF LANERIC WHO HAD BEEN SENT INTO SCOTLAND IN ORDER TO OPPOSE THESE MEASURES WANTED EITHER AUTHORITY OR SINCERITY
AND CHALONER THE INTIMATE FRIEND OF TOMKINS HAD ENTERTAINED LIKE SENTIMENTS AND AS THE CONNECTIONS OF THESE TWO GENTLEMEN LAY CHIEFLY IN THE CITY THEY INFORMED WALLER THAT THE SAME ABHORRENCE OF WAR PREVAILED THERE AMONG ALL MEN OF REASON AND MODERATION
TO FIND SECURITY FOR BOTH PARTIES ESPECIALLY FOR THAT OF THE PARLIAMENT AMIDST SUCH VIOLENT ANIMOSITIES POWER ALONE COULD INSURE SAFETY AND THE POWER OF ONE SIDE WAS NECESSARILY ATTENDED WITH DANGER TO THE OTHER
THEIR DEMANDS CONTAINED IN NINETEEN PROPOSITIONS AMOUNTED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY THEY REQUIRED THAT NO MAN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE COUNCIL WHO WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO PARLIAMENT
AND THE BONE BROKEN SOME DAYS AFTER HE DIED IN EXQUISITE PAIN OF HIS WOUND NOR COULD HIS WHOLE PARTY HAD THEIR ARMY MET WITH A TOTAL OVERTHROW HAVE BEEN THROWN INTO GREATER CONSTERNATION
TRANSPORTED TO A DEGREE OF MADNESS WITH RELIGIOUS ECSTASIES HE NEVER FORGOT THE POLITICAL PURPOSES TO WHICH THEY MIGHT SERVE HATING MONARCHY WHILE A SUBJECT DESPISING LIBERTY WHILE A CITIZEN
EVEN IN A FEAST WHICH THE CITY GAVE TO THE PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL OF STATE IT WAS DEEMED A REQUISITE PRECAUTION IF WE MAY CREDIT WALKER AND DUGDALE
AND THE DEPUTY LIEUTENANTS OF SOME SUSPECTED COUNTIES WERE ORDERED TO PUT THE PEOPLE IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE THE PULPITS LIKEWISE WERE CALLED IN AID
AND ENDOWED WITH THAT DIGNIFIED PRIDE WHICH SO WELL BECAME HIS RANK AND STATION THE EARL OF ESSEX WHO INHERITED ALL HIS FATHER'S POPULARITY AND HAVING FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH SOUGHT RENOWN IN ARMS
COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE PUBLIC ENVY AND HOWEVER MEN'S HATRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE DUKE'S CONDUCT SEEMED TO GRATIFY THEIR PASSIONS AND THEIR PREJUDICES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM LONG TO PRESERVE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE
HAVING JOINED CROMWELL AND YOUNG FAIRFAX OBTAINED A CONSIDERABLE VICTORY OVER THE ROYALISTS AT HORNCASTLE WHERE THE TWO OFFICERS LAST MENTIONED GAINED RENOWN BY THEIR CONDUCT AND GALLANTRY AND THOUGH FORTUNE HAD THUS BALANCED HER FAVORS
AND WHILE HE EXPRESSED HIS OWN PENITENCE HE RECEIVED THEIR DEVOUT EXHORTATIONS WITH HUMILITY AND REVERENCE AS CONVEYING CLEARER CONVICTION AND INFORMATION THAN IN HIS LIFE HE HAD EVER BEFORE ATTAINED PRESENTS TOO OF WHICH AS WELL AS OF FLATTERY
BY WHOSE SAGACITY AND INSINUATION FAIRFAX WAS ENTIRELY GOVERNED IS ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT AND MOST SINGULAR PERSONAGES THAT OCCURS IN HISTORY THE STROKES OF HIS CHARACTER ARE AS OPEN AND STRONGLY MARKED AS THE SCHEMES OF HIS CONDUCT WERE DURING THE TIME
AFTER MANY FRUITLESS EVASIONS THE KING
HE LIGHTLY MENTIONED THE OCCASION WHICH HE HAD FOR SUPPLY HE EMPLOYED NO INTRIGUE TO INFLUENCE THE SUFFRAGES OF THE MEMBERS HE WOULD NOT EVEN ALLOW THE OFFICERS OF THE CROWN WHO HAD SEATS IN THE HOUSE
YOU SPEAK OF JEALOUSIES AND FEARS LAY YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEARTS AND ASK YOURSELVES WHETHER I MAY NOT LIKEWISE BE DISTURBED WITH FEARS AND JEALOUSIES AND IF SO I ASSURE YOU THAT THIS MESSAGE HAS NOTHING LESSENED THEM
A CERTAIN PROOF THAT A DISCOVERY OF THIS NATURE WAS NOT AS IS IMAGINED BY SEVERAL HISTORIANS
THIS WAS THE IMPEACHMENT OF LORD KIMBOLTON AND THE FIVE MEMBERS WHEN THE COMMONS EMPLOYED IN THEIR REMONSTRANCE LANGUAGE SO SEVERE AND INDECENT THEY HAD NOT BEEN ACTUATED ENTIRELY BY INSOLENCE AND PASSION
OF FALLING ON THE REAR OF THE ROYALISTS HE WAS REPULSED ROUTED AND PURSUED WITH CONSIDERABLE LOSS STUNNED AND DISHEARTENED WITH THIS BLOW HIS ARMY DECAYED AND MELTED AWAY BY DESERTION AND THE KING THOUGHT HE MIGHT SAFELY LEAVE IT
BUT THIS UNDERTAKING BY REASON OF THE GREAT NUMBER AND FORCE OF THE LONDON MILITIA WAS THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE ATTENDED WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTIES GLOUCESTER LYING WITHIN TWENTY MILES
HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF MANY AND TO RECOVER THEM FROM THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH AT FIRST THEY HAD BEEN SEIZED
INDEPENDENTS EXALTED TO A HIGHER PITCH ABOLISHED ECCLESIASTICAL GOVERNMENT DISDAINED CREEDS AND SYSTEMS NEGLECTED EVERY CEREMONY AND CONFOUNDED ALL RANKS AND ORDERS THE SOLDIER THE MERCHANT
BEDFORD HOLLAND AND CONWAY HAD DESERTED THE PARLIAMENT AND HAD GONE TO OXFORD CLARE AND LOVELACE HAD FOLLOWED THEM
AND EVERY ERROR RENDERED UNPARDONABLE BY THIS IMPUTATION WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO IMPLY THE HEIGHT OF ALL ENORMITIES THIS MAN MY LORDS SAID SERJEANT WILDE CONCLUDING HIS LONG SPEECH AGAINST HIM
BUCKINGHAM THOUGH LYING UNDER IMPEACHMENT WAS YET BY MEANS OF COURT INTEREST CHOSEN IN HIS PLACE THE COMMONS RESENTED AND LOUDLY COMPLAINED OF THIS AFFRONT AND THE MORE TO ENRAGE THEM THE KING HIMSELF WROTE A LETTER TO THE UNIVERSITY EXTOLLING THE DUKE
LORD FALKLAND HAD ACCEPTED THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY A MAN WHO ADORNED THE PUREST VIRTUE WITH THE RICHEST GIFTS OF NATURE AND THE MOST VALUABLE ACQUISITIONS OF LEARNING BY HIM ASSISTED BY THE KING HIMSELF
AND FOR THE OBSERVANCE AND PRESERVATION OF THE LAWS AND I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS AND ASSIST THOSE LAWS FOR MY PRESERVATION NO SOONER DID THE COMMONS DESPAIR OF OBTAINING THE KING'S CONSENT TO THEIR BILL THAN THEY INSTANTLY VOTED
WE SHALL NOT ENTER INTO A DETAIL OF THIS MATTER WHICH AT PRESENT SEEMS TO ADMIT OF LITTLE CONTROVERSY IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT AFTER A LONG TRIAL AND THE EXAMINATION OF ABOVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY WITNESSES
SIR DUDLEY DIGGES SIR JOHN ELLIOT SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH MISTER SELDEN AND MISTER PYM ANIMATED WITH A WARM REGARD TO LIBERTY
WHICH BRINGETH SUCH HAPPINESS TO THIS NATION AND MAKES US ENVIED OF ALL OTHERS WHILE THERE IS THIS SWEETNESS BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY AND THE COMMONS LEST WE LOSE THE REPUTE OF A FREE PEOPLE BY OUR TURBULENCY IN PARLIAMENT
THEY BOUND THE PERSONS TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF HIS MAJESTY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND INVENTING A DISTINCTION HITHERTO UNHEARD OF BETWEEN THE OFFICE AND THE PERSON OF THE KING
NOW REQUIRED HIM TO ABANDON A PARTY WHERE HE MET WITH SUCH UNWORTHY TREATMENT NEXT MORNING EARLY HE SENT WORD TO THE PRINCE THAT HE WAS INSTANTLY TO LEAVE THE KINGDOM AND WITHOUT DELAY HE WENT TO SCARBOROUGH WHERE HE FOUND A VESSEL WHICH CARRIED HIM BEYOND SEA
THEY MADE A DEMAND THE MOST ABSURD IN THE WORLD THAT THE BISHOPS BEING ALL OF THEM PARTIES SHOULD BE REFUSED A VOTE WITH REGARD TO THAT QUESTION AFTER THE RESOLUTION WAS ONCE FORMED BY THE COMMONS
AND COMMANDED EVERY ONE TO DEFEND THE LIBERTY OF THE MEMBERS THE KING IRRITATED BY ALL THIS OPPOSITION RESOLVED NEXT DAY TO COME IN PERSON TO THE HOUSE WITH AN INTENTION TO DEMAND PERHAPS SEIZE IN THEIR PRESENCE
AND HELD INVESTED IN HIS SINGLE PERSON THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OFFICES OF THE CROWN HOWEVER THE ILL HUMOR OF THE COMMONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS WE ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE THEM THE SOLE MOTIVES
HE TOO EITHER FROM VANITY OR POLITICS HAD VENTURED TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN BUT A PRIEST PAST MIDDLE AGE OF A SEVERE CHARACTER AND OCCUPIED IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE PLANS OF AMBITION OR VENGEANCE
HAD DONE WISELY ON THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR IN ENGAGING SEVERAL OF ITS MEMBERS IN THE MOST DANGEROUS PARTS OF IT AND THEREBY SATISFYING THE NATION THAT THEY INTENDED TO SHARE ALL HAZARDS WITH THE MEANEST OF THE PEOPLE BUT AFFAIRS ARE NOW CHANGED DURING THE PROGRESS OF MILITARY OPERATIONS
MEN OF SUCH ASPIRING GENIUSES AND SUCH INDEPENDENT FORTUNES COULD NOT LONG DELIBERATE THEY BOLDLY EMBRACED THE SIDE OF FREEDOM AND RESOLVED TO GRANT NO SUPPLIES TO THEIR NECESSITOUS PRINCE WITHOUT EXTORTING CONCESSIONS IN FAVOR OF CIVIL LIBERTY
AND THAT THE PEERS WERE NOTHING BUT INDIVIDUALS WHO HELD THEIR SEATS IN A PARTICULAR CAPACITY AND THEREFORE IF THEIR LORDSHIPS WILL NOT CONSENT TO THE PASSING OF ACTS NECESSARY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE PEOPLE THE COMMONS
AND THEY HAD TIME TO WITHDRAW A MOMENT BEFORE THE KING ENTERED HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS ORDINARY RETINUE TO THE NUMBER OF ABOVE TWO HUNDRED ARMED AS USUAL SOME WITH HALBERTS
OR WHAT PRIVATE SECURITY TO THOSE WHO IN OPPOSITION TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW HAVE SO GENEROUSLY VENTURED THEIR LIVES IN ITS DEFENCE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS APPREHENSION
TOGETHER WITH SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ARE MORE SENSIBLE OF THE DANGER MUST JOIN TOGETHER AND REPRESENT THE MATTER TO HIS MAJESTY SO VIOLENT WAS THE DEMOCRATICAL ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT THE NATION
STILL RETAINED AN ATTACHMENT TO THE HIERARCHY AND TO THE ANCIENT MODES OF WORSHIP BUT IN THE PRESENT DANGER WHICH THREATENED THEIR CAUSE ALL SCRUPLES WERE LAID ASIDE AND THE COVENANT
WERE TRAITORS TO THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE KINGDOM THE ARMIES WHICH HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE RAISED ON PRETENCE OF THE SERVICE IN IRELAND WERE HENCEFORTH MORE OPENLY ENLISTED BY THE PARLIAMENT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES
IN THESE RIGID OPINIONS THE WHOLE SECTARIES AMIDST ALL THEIR OTHER DIFFERENCES UNANIMOUSLY CONCURRED THE POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE INDEPENDENTS KEPT PACE WITH THEIR RELIGIOUS NOT CONTENT WITH CONFINING TO VERY NARROW LIMITS THE POWER OF THE CROWN
AND A NATIONAL ENGAGEMENT ATTENDED WITH EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT COULD RENDER A PROMISE SACRED AND OBLIGATORY WAS ENTERED INTO WITH THE SCOTS NEVER TO SUFFER ITS READMISSION ALL THESE MEASURES SHOWED LITTLE SPIRIT OF ACCOMMODATION IN THE PARLIAMENT
AFFABILITY AND EVERY AMIABLE VIRTUE THESE MEN FINDING THAT THEIR CREDIT RAN HIGH WITH THE NATION VENTURED TO ENCOURAGE THOSE POPULAR DISORDERS WHICH THEY VAINLY IMAGINED
AS WELL FOR THE SECURITY OF THE IRISH PROTESTANTS AS FOR PROMOTING HIS INTERESTS IN ENGLAND THE PARLIAMENT IN ORDER TO BLACKEN HIS CONDUCT REPROACHED HIM WITH FAVORING THAT ODIOUS REBELLION
EXCITED BY EMULATION OR SUPPORTED BY HIS HABITS OF HYPOCRISY ENDEAVORED TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF BEYOND HIS FELLOWS AND TO ARRIVE AT A HIGHER PITCH OF SAINTSHIP AND PERFECTION IN PROPORTION TO ITS DEGREE OF FANATICISM
THE ONLY CHARGE WHICH COULD BE REGARDED AS IMPORTANT WAS THAT HE HAD EXTORTED A SUM OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS FROM THE EAST INDIA COMPANY AND THAT HE HAD CONFISCATED SOME GOODS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS ON PRETENCE OF THEIR BEING THE PROPERTY OF SPANISH
CONTRARY TO THE ARTICLES OF THE MARRIAGE TREATY HE ENCOURAGED THE ENGLISH SHIPS OF WAR AND PRIVATEERS TO SEIZE VESSELS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH A COMMON WEALTH OR
AND THE SECTARIES RESOLVED TO GRATIFY THEIR VENGEANCE IN THE PUNISHMENT OF THIS PRELATE WHO HAD SO LONG BY HIS AUTHORITY AND BY THE EXECUTION OF PENAL LAWS KEPT THEIR ZEALOUS SPIRIT UNDER CONFINEMENT
AMIDST THE GREATEST SECURITY THEY AFFECTED CONTINUAL FEARS OF DESTRUCTION TO THEMSELVES AND THE NATION AND SEEMED TO QUAKE AT EVERY BREATH OR RUMOR OF DANGER
AND OF ADMINISTERING PHYSIC TO THE LATE KING WITHOUT ACQUAINTING HIS PHYSICIANS ALL THESE ARTICLES APPEAR FROM COMPARING THE ACCUSATION AND REPLY TO BE EITHER FRIVOLOUS OR FALSE OR BOTH
HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE MODESTY OF CHARLES EXCEEDED EVEN THAT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE WEAKNESS OF JAMES NOR WAS ANY PUBLIC MEASURE CONDUCTED BUT BY HIS COUNSEL AND DIRECTION
HAD BASELY SOLD HIM TOGETHER WITH THEIR OWN HONOR TO HIS BARBAROUS ENEMIES
THE BARE SUGGESTION WAS GIVEN AS NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE A NEWSBOY AND ARE SELLING PAPERS OR NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE HUNTING AND ARE GOING INTO THE WOODS TO SHOOT BIRDS SO THE PARTY WAS STARTED
WE SHALL CONSIDER IN ANOTHER CHAPTER IN THIS CONNECTION WE FIND GREAT INTEREST IN AN ARTICLE IN THE MEDICAL NEWS JULY TWENTY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
THE SENSATIONS PRODUCED DURING A STATE OF HYPNOSIS ARE VERY INTERESTING AS MAY BE SUPPOSED THEY DIFFER GREATLY IN DIFFERENT PERSONS
IN WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE EFFECTS OF MUSIC UPON HYPNOTIC SUBJECTS WHILE IN VIENNA HE TOOK OCCASION TO OBSERVE CLOSELY THE ENTHUSIASTIC MUSICAL DEVOTEES AS THEY SAT IN THE AUDIENCE AT THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF WAGNER'S OPERAS
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE HYPNOTIST COMMANDED ME TO AWAKE AS SOON AS I DROPPED MY ARM AND YET TEN MINUTES OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS HAD PASSED ON A SUBSEQUENT OCCASION DOCTOR COCKE WHO WAS BLIND WAS PUT INTO A DEEP HYPNOTIC SLEEP
HERE AGAIN THE CONSCIOUSNESS MAY BE ONLY PARTIALLY AFFECTED AND THE PERSON IN WHOM SLEEP COMA OR HALLUCINATION IS PRODUCED WHETHER BY PHYSICAL MEANS OR BY THE INFLUENCE OF SUGGESTION MAY REMAIN SUBJECT TO THE WILL OF OTHERS AND INCAPABLE OF EXERCISING HIS OWN VOLITION
ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING ACCOUNTS EVER GIVEN IS THAT OF DOCTOR JAMES R COCKE A HYPNOTIST HIMSELF WHO SUBMITTED TO BEING OPERATED UPON BY A PROFESSIONAL MAGNETIZER
THAT THE WILL OR THE GESTURES OR THE MAGNETIC OR VITAL FLUID OF THE OPERATOR
SHE TOUCHED EACH ONE OF THE CLASS IN SUCCESSION AND EVERY ONE MANIFESTED THE UTMOST PAIN AND FEAR ONE SUBJECT SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND CRIED IN DIRE DISTRESS
EITHER IN MEN OR IN ANIMALS THAT DURING NATURAL SLEEP THE UPPER PART OF THE BRAIN ITS CONVOLUTED SURFACE WHICH IN HEALTH AND IN THE WAKING STATE IS FAINTLY PINK LIKE A BLUSHING CHEEK
WILL FIND DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY OTHER INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS IN THE SAME ARTICLE DOCTOR COCKE DESCRIBES A PECULIAR TRICK HE PLAYED UPON THE SIGHT OF A SUBJECT SAYS HE I ONCE HYPNOTIZED A MAN
THEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN AND TWIRLED THEM FASTER AND FASTER IN SPITE OF THEIR EFFORTS TO STOP ONE OF THE SUBJECTS SAID HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE STRANGE ACTION OF HIS HANDS AND SOMETIMES IT PUZZLED HIM TO KNOW WHY THEY WHIRLED
OR ABEYANCE OF FUNCTION IN THE WILL CENTERS AND UPPER CONVOLUTIONS OF THE BRAIN AS IN ITS OTHER CENTERS OF LOCALIZATION HERE THEN WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE A CLUE TO THE PHENOMENA PHENOMENA WHICH AS I HAVE POINTED OUT
AND TAKING HIM INTO THE CENTER OF THE STAGE SHOWED HIM A SMALL RIDING WHIP HE LOOKED AT IT INDIFFERENTLY ENOUGH HE WAS TOLD IT WAS A HOT BAR OF IRON BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD STILL INCREDULOUS
WAS PLAYED FROM THE PIANO SCORE THE PULSE OF THE SUBJECT BECAME MORE RAPID AND AT FIRST OF HIGHER TENSION INCREASING FROM A NORMAL RATE OF SIXTY BEATS A MINUTE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THEN
IN AN ARTICLE IN THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL GIVES A GENERAL EXPLANATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF HYPNOTISM WHICH WE MAY ACCEPT AS TRUE SO FAR AS IT GOES BUT WHICH IS EVIDENTLY INCOMPLETE HE SEEMS TO MINIMIZE PERSONAL INFLUENCE TOO MUCH
THAT SOME PEOPLE ALWAYS BLUSH ON THE MENTION OF CERTAIN THINGS OR CALLING UP CERTAIN IDEAS CERTAIN OTHER IDEAS WILL MAKE THEM TURN PALE NOW IF CERTAIN PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE MADE TO BLUSH OR TURN PALE
THAT FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS THEY COULD SEE MORE WONDERS THAN EVER BEFORE HAD BEEN CROWDED UNDER ONE CANVAS TENT HE HARANGUED THE CROWD AS THEY SURGED ABOUT THE TENT DOOR
BY FIXING HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND THIS TIME HE EXPERIENCED A STILL GREATER DEGREE OF TERROR AND INCIDENTALLY LEARNED THAT HE COULD HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF THE MATTER OF SELF HYPNOTISM
HE BECOMES AWARE OF A WATERING OF THE MOUTH AND A GNAWING SENSATION AT THE STOMACH WHAT DOES THIS MEAN IT MEANS THAT THE MENTAL IMPRESSION MADE UPON HIM BY THE WELCOME AND APPETIZING SPECTACLE HAS CAUSED A SECRETION OF SALIVA AND OF GASTRIC JUICE
BY PROLONGING THE OPERATION A WHOLE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE OR LESS HYPNOTIZED IN ALL SUCH CASES HOWEVER UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT IS COMMONLY FOLLOWED BY UNUSUAL LETHARGY
WE MAY INTRODUCE A VOLATILE SUBSTANCE SUCH AS CHLOROFORM AND ITS FIRST EFFECT WILL BE TO ABOLISH CONSCIOUSNESS AND INDUCE PROFOUND SLUMBER AND A BLESSED INSENSIBILITY TO PAIN THE LIKE EFFECTS WILL FOLLOW MORE SLOWLY UPON THE ABSORPTION OF A DRUG
SUCH AS OPIUM OR WE MAY INDUCE HALLUCINATIONS BY INTRODUCING INTO THE BLOOD OTHER TOXIC SUBSTANCES SUCH AS INDIAN HEMP OR STRAMONIUM WE ARE NOT CONSCIOUS OF THE MECHANISM PRODUCING THE ARTERIAL CONTRACTION
ALL THE WORLD LOVES A LOVER AS THE SAYING IS AND ALL THE WORLD LOVES TO LAUGH AT HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WAS TOLD THAT THE HEAD OF A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WAS ON FIRE
IN THE MEANTIME THE ACT HAD CAUSED GREAT LAUGHTER AMONG THE REST OF THE CLASS ONE YOUNG FELLOW IN PARTICULAR LAUGHED SO UPROARIOUSLY THAT TEARS COURSED DOWN HIS CHEEKS AND HE TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO WIPE HIS EYES
THIS OBSERVATION SUGGESTED TO HIM AN INTERESTING SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS HIS FIRST SUBJECT WAS EASILY HYPNOTIZED AND OF AN EMOTIONAL NATURE WAGNER'S
AS THE MUSIC PROGRESSED THE TENSION DIMINISHED THE RESPIRATION INCREASED FROM EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY PER MINUTE GREAT EXCITEMENT IN THE SUBJECT WAS EVIDENT HIS WHOLE BODY WAS THROWN INTO MOTION HIS LEGS WERE DRAWN UP HIS ARMS TOSSED INTO THE AIR
THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE GIVEN BY DOCTOR HERBERT L FLINT A VERY SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC OPERATOR IT IS IN THE LANGUAGE OF AN EYE WITNESS A NEW YORK LAWYER
ONE YOUNG FELLOW AGED ABOUT EIGHTEEN SAID THAT HE WAS ADDICTED TO THE CIGARETTE HABIT THE SUGGESTION WAS MADE TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE ENTERTAINMENT HE WAS ASKED TO SMOKE AS WAS HIS USUAL HABIT
FOR IN THE ORIENT HYPNOTISM IS MUCH EASIER AND MORE SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED THAN WITH US OF THE WEST THE PERFORMANCES OF THE DERVISHES AND ALSO OF THE FAKIRS WHO WOUND THEMSELVES AND PERFORM MANY WONDERFUL FEATS
I WAS INTENSELY COLD MY HEART SEEMED TO STAND STILL I HAD RINGING IN MY EARS MY HAIR SEEMED TO RISE UPON MY SCALP I PERSISTED IN THE EFFORT AND THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED NOISE IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER
HE WAS INFORMED THAT HE COULD TELL WHO THE FATHER WAS BY THE SIMILARITY AND THE COLOR OF THE EYES THESE SUGGESTIONS WERE MADE IN A LOUD TONE MISS FLINT BEING NO NEARER ONE SUBJECT THAN ANOTHER
AND WITH THIS SENSATION HE REGAINED SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THIS IS TO BE DOUBTED AS A RULE SUBJECTS IN THIS STAGE OF HYPNOTISM DO NOT FEEL ANY SENSATION THAT THEY CAN REMEMBER
INVISIBLE TO THE HYPNOTIC SUBJECT ON A SHEET OF WHITE PAPER AND YET CAUSE HIM TO LOOK FIXEDLY AT A DOT ON THE PAPER ON OR NEAR THE RED CROSS HE WILLS ON TRANSFERRING HIS EYE TO THE BLANK SHEET SEE A BLUISH GREEN AFTER IMAGE OF THE CROSS
AT THIS POINT DOCTOR FLINT'S DAUGHTER TOOK CHARGE OF THE CLASS SHE POINTED HER FINGER AT ONE OF THEM AND THE SUBJECT BEGAN TO LOOK STEADILY BEFORE HIM AT WHICH THE REST OF THE CLASS WERE HIGHLY AMUSED
DISGUISED BY THE SHEET THE HOUSE RESOUNDED WITH ROARS OF LAUGHTER THE SUBJECT HOWEVER WAS DEAF TO ALL OF THE NOISE HE WAS ABSORBED IN HIS COURTSHIP AND HE CONTINUED TO HUG THE BROOM AND EXHIBIT IN HIS FEATURES
THE MANNER IN WHICH LITTLE BY LITTLE HE VENTURED UPON A FAMILIAR FOOTING WAS EXCEEDINGLY FUNNY BUT WHEN IN A MOMENT OF CONFIDENT RESPONSE TO HIS WOOING HE CLASPED HER ROUND THE WAIST AND IMPRINTED A CHASTE KISS UPON THE BRUSHY PART OF THE BROOM
THE SUGGESTION WAS REPEATED AND AS THE GLAZED LOOK CAME INTO HIS EYES THE INCREDULOUS LOOK DIED OUT EVERY MEMBER OF THE CLASS WAS FOLLOWING THE SUGGESTION MADE TO THE SUBJECT IN HAND ALL OF THEM HAD THE SAME EXPRESSION IN THEIR EYES THE DOCTOR SAID
THAT WHAT THEY WERE REALLY DOING WAS TO FORCE THEIR HANDS CLOSER TOGETHER THUS OBEYING THE COUNTER SUGGESTION THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TRYING TO UNCLASP THEIR HANDS WAS EVIDENT FROM THEIR ENDEAVORS
SUCH A CONDITION I SAY IS ALWAYS SUBJECTIVE IT IS INDEPENDENT OF PASSES OR GESTURES IT HAS NO RELATION TO ANY FLUID EMANATING FROM THE OPERATOR IT HAS NO RELATION TO HIS WILL
CONVEY WITH GREAT RAPIDITY MESSAGES TO ITS VARIOUS PARTS WHICH ARE ANSWERED BY REFLECTED WAVES OF IMPULSE IF THE SOLES OF THE FEET BE TICKLED CONTRACTION OF THE TOES OR INVOLUNTARY LAUGHTER WILL BE EXCITED
HE POINTED TO A SUPPOSITIOUS CANVAS PICTURE HE CHAFFED THE BOYS HE FLATTERED THE VANITY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS WITH THEIR GIRLS TELLING THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT AFFORD FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS TO MISS THIS GREAT SHOW
ARE SIMILAR TO AND HAVE MUCH IN COMMON WITH MESMERIC SLEEP HYPNOTISM OR ELECTRO BIOLOGY WE HAVE ALREADY I HOPE SUCCEEDED IN ELIMINATING FROM OUR MINDS THE FALSE THEORY THE THEORY THAT IS TO SAY EXPERIMENTALLY PROVED TO BE FALSE
IN A LIKE MANNER IT IS POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE COMA AND PROLONGED INSENSIBILITY BY PRESSURE OF THE THUMBS ON THE CAROTID OR HALLUCINATION DREAMS AND VISIONS BY DRUGS OR BY EXTERNAL STIMULATION OF THE NERVES
BECOMES WHITE AND ALMOST BLOODLESS IT IS IN THESE UPPER CONVOLUTIONS OF THE BRAIN AS WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE WILL AND THE DIRECTING POWER ARE RESIDENT SO THAT IN SLEEP THE WILL IS ABOLISHED AND CONSCIOUSNESS FADES GRADUALLY AWAY
YET I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT WHILE ONE PART OF MY MIND WANTED TO OPEN MY EYES ANOTHER PART DID NOT WANT TO SO I WAS IN A PARADOXICAL STATE I BELIEVED THAT I COULD OPEN MY EYES AND YET COULD NOT
COURTING A BROOMSTICK THE SIDE SHOW LET US NOW DESCRIBE SOME OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF HYPNOTISM TO SEE JUST HOW IT OPERATES AND HOW IT EXHIBITS ITSELF
OR IN WHAT ORDER THEY ARE ARRANGED SIMILARLY IF THE ORIGINAL SINGLE LINE TO WHICH HE IS BLIND BE DOUBLED BY A PRISM OF SIXTEEN DEGREES PLACED BEFORE ONE OF HIS EYES BOTH BEING KEPT OPEN
HERE THEN IT IS SEEN THAT WE HAVE A MECHANISM IN THE BODY KNOWN TO PHYSIOLOGISTS AS THE IDEO MOTOR OR SENSORY MOTOR SYSTEM OF NERVES WHICH CAN PRODUCE WITHOUT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND AUTOMATICALLY A SERIES OF MUSCULAR CONTRACTIONS
AND REMEMBER THAT THE COATS OF THE ARTERIES ARE MUSCULAR AND CONTRACTILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXTERNAL STIMULI ACTING WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OR WHEN THE CONSCIOUSNESS IS IN ABEYANCE I WILL GIVE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS WHICH COMPLETES THE CHAIN OF PHENOMENA
MAY SIMULTANEOUSLY BECOME HIGHLY CONGESTED NOW IF THE BRAIN OR ANY PART OF IT BE DEPRIVED OF THE CIRCULATION OF BLOOD THROUGH IT OR BE RENDERED PARTIALLY BLOODLESS OR IF IT BE EXCESSIVELY CONGESTED AND OVERLOADED WITH BLOOD
AND HIS LANGUAGE WAS UTTERLY DEVOID OF SENSE WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND A VERY INTELLIGENT LADY WHO BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN PERSONATED THE PART VERY WELL DOCTOR COOKE SAYS OF HIMSELF
THE FEELING OF NOT WISHING TO OPEN MY EYES WAS NOT BASED UPON ANY DESIRE TO PLEASE THE OPERATOR I HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIM IN ANY WAY BUT BE IT UNDERSTOOD I FIRMLY BELIEVED IN HIS POWER TO CONTROL ME
THIS PROVES THAT IT HAS IMPRESSED HIS SENSIBILITY HE HAS FELT BUT NOT PERCEIVED IT HE HAD ACTUALLY IGNORED IT REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE IT AS IT WERE DOCTOR ERNEST HART AN ENGLISH WRITER
THAT PERSONAL INFLUENCE WHICH WE ALL EXERT AT VARIOUS TIMES AND WHICH HE IGNORES NOT BECAUSE HE WOULD DENY IT BUT BECAUSE HE FEARS LENDING COUNTENANCE TO THE MAGNETIC FLUID AND OTHER SIMILAR THEORIES SAYS HE
SOON BECAME REAL TO HIM AND HE FOUND HIMSELF TAKING PART IN A WILD CHASE NOT AS WITCH DEVIL OR TAM EVEN BUT IN SOME WAY HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WAS SPREAD THROUGH EVERY PART OF THE SCENE BEING OF IT
MOREOVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION CAREFULLY CONCEALED AND CALLED BY ANOTHER NAME OPENS ANOTHER GREAT FIELD OF HUMBUG AND CHARLATANISM OF WHICH THE ADVERTISING COLUMNS OF THE NEWSPAPERS ARE CONSTANTLY FILLED
HE WAS AT THAT TIME A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE THEORY OF PERSONAL MAGNETISM A DELUSION FROM WHICH HE AFTERWARD ESCAPED ON THE OCCASION WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE OPERATOR COMMANDED HIM TO CLOSE HIS EYES
THIS SUBJECT DID NOT PASS INTO SUCH A DEEP STATE OF HYPNOTISM BUT THE RESULT WAS PRACTICALLY THE SAME THE PULSE RATE ROSE FROM SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THE SENSATION REMEMBERED WAS THAT OF RIDING FURIOUSLY THROUGH THE AIR
WE FREE OURSELVES FROM THE INFLUENCE OF NOISES OF STRONG LIGHT OF POWERFUL COLORS OR OF TACTILE IMPRESSIONS WE LIE DOWN AND ENDEAVOR TO SOOTHE BRAIN ACTIVITY BY DRIVING AWAY DISTURBING THOUGHTS OR AS PEOPLE SOMETIMES SAY
THOUGH HE IS LOCKED UP IN A SEPARATE ROOM HE CAN MAKE THE PSYCHIC POWER WORK THROUGH THE WALLS ALL THAT HE DOES IS TO PUT HIS SUBJECTS IN THE WAY OF HYPNOTIZING THEMSELVES
WHICH I DO NOT THINK IT VERY DIFFICULT TO ACQUIRE WE ALSO KNOW THAT MANY PERSONS CAN WAKE AT A FIXED HOUR IN THE MORNING BY SETTING THEIR MINDS UPON IT JUST BEFORE GOING TO SLEEP NOW THERE IS SOMETHING HERE WHICH DESERVES A LITTLE FURTHER EXAMINATION
TO HIM IT ALWAYS EXPRESSED THE PICTURED WILD RIDE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF WOTAN THE SUBJECT TAKING PART IN THE RIDE IT WAS NOTICEABLE IN EACH CASE THAT THE SAME MUSIC PLAYED TO THEM IN THE WAKING STATE PRODUCED NO SPECIAL IMPRESSION
TRIED TO CROSS THE ALPS IN WINTER AND IN THEIR STRUGGLES WERE ALL LOST OR SOLD INTO SLAVERY WITHOUT EVEN REACHING THE HOLY LAND AGAIN HYPNOTISM IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE POET'S DREAMS
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT HYPNOTISM IS A COMPLEX STATE WHICH CANNOT BE EXPLAINED IN AN OFFHAND WAY IN A SENTENCE OR TWO THERE ARE HOWEVER CERTAIN ASPECTS OF HYPNOTISM WHICH WE MAY SUPPOSE SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED
BUT HE DID OPEN THEM AT ONCE AGAIN HE TOLD HIM TO CLOSE THE EYES AND AT THE SAME TIME HE GENTLY STROKED HIS HEAD AND FACE AND EYELIDS WITH HIS HAND DOCTOR COCKE FANCIED HE FELT A TINGLING SENSATION IN HIS FOREHEAD AND EYES
AND THE BLOODLESSNESS OF THOSE CONVOLUTIONS RELATED TO NATURAL SLEEP BUT WE ARE NOT ALTOGETHER WITHOUT CONTROL OVER THEM WE CAN WE KNOW HELP TO COMPOSE OURSELVES TO SLEEP AS WE SAY IN ORDINARY LANGUAGE
BY CERTAIN SCIENTIFIC WRITERS ON THE SUBJECT FIRST WHAT IS THE CHARACTER OF THE DELUSIONS APPARENTLY CREATED IN THE MIND OF A PERSON IN THE HYPNOTIC CONDITION BY A SIMPLE WORD OF MOUTH STATEMENT AS WHEN A PHYSICIAN SAYS
THEIR IMPERSONATIONS ARE RIDICULOUS IN THE EXTREME ONE MAN I REMEMBER BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLES SUMNER BEING UNEDUCATED HE USED THE MOST WRETCHED ENGLISH
THIS IS AN INSTANCE OF WHAT IS CALLED POST HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION DOCTOR COCKE TELLS OF SUGGESTING TO A DRINKER WHOM HE WAS TRYING TO CURE OF THE HABIT THAT FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS ANYTHING HE TOOK WOULD MAKE HIM VOMIT
THEN HE CALMLY RESUMED HIS GARMENT AND WALKED BACK TO THE STAGE THE SIDE SHOW CLOSED THE EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT A YOUNG MAN WAS TOLD TO THINK OF HIMSELF AS MANAGING A SIDE SHOW AT A CIRCUS
THE ROAR BECAME DEAFENING IT CRACKLED LIKE A MIGHTY FIRE I WAS FEARFULLY CONSCIOUS OF MYSELF HAVING READ VIVID ACCOUNTS OF DREAMS VISIONS ET CETERA IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I WOULD EXPERIENCE THEM
AS ARE ADEQUATE TO PRODUCE SLEEP IN THE NATURAL STATE OR ARTIFICIAL SLUMBER EITHER BY TOTAL DEPRIVATION OR BY EXCESSIVE INCREASE OR LOCAL ABERRATION IN THE QUANTITY OR QUALITY OF BLOOD
PRESENTLY THE SUBJECT'S HEAD LEANED FORWARD THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES DILATED AND ASSUMED A PECULIAR GLASSY STARE HE AROSE WITH A STEADY GLIDING GAIT
WHO WERE SEATED ON THE STAGE IN A SEMICIRCLE FACING THE AUDIENCE AND STROKING EACH ONE'S HEAD AND FOREHEAD REPEATING THE PHRASES CLOSE YOUR EYES THINK OF NOTHING BUT SLEEP YOU ARE VERY TIRED YOU ARE DROWSY
IT BECAME SLOW AND IRREGULAR AND VERY SMALL THE RESPIRATION DECREASED ALMOST TO GASPING THE FACE GREW PALE AND A COLD PERSPIRATION BROKE OUT READERS WHO ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT
AND HOW IT EXTENDS TO THE PROFESSIONAL SUBJECTS AS WELL AS TO THE PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS TILL THOSE SUBJECTS EVEN IMPOSE UPON SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO OUGHT TO BE PROOF AGAINST SUCH DECEPTION
THIS IS SO TO SPEAK A PROCESS OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION AND I HAVE OFTEN PRACTICED IT WHEN GOING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE WHEN IN THE MIDST OF A BUSY PRACTICE AND I SOMETIMES HAVE AMUSED MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY BY EXERCISING THIS FACULTY
LET US QUOTE DOCTOR COCKE'S EXPERIMENT IN HYPNOTIZING HIMSELF IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT A PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTIZER OR MAGNETIZER HAD HYPNOTIZED HIM BY TELLING HIM TO FIX HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND
AND POSSIBLY PREY UPON THE POCKETS OF A CREDULOUS AND WONDER LOVING PUBLIC SUCH NAMES AS MESMERIC CONDITION MAGNETIC SLEEP CLAIRVOYANCE ELECTRO BIOLOGY ANIMAL MAGNETISM FAITH TRANCE AND MANY OTHER ALIASES
THAT HE HAS EXPERIMENTED IN THIS DIRECTION WITH PATIENTS OF HIS SAYS HE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESIST THE STATE OR TO BRING IT AT WILL MANY OF THEM DESCRIBE BEAUTIFUL SCENES FROM NATURE OR SOME MIGHTY CATHEDRAL
I DO NOT THINK WE ARE AS WELL SUITED TO EACH OTHER AFTER ALL AS WE HAVE FANCIED
CAN YOU ROW SO FAR ALONE EASILY
JOHN THE GARDENER HAD KILLED IT AND I VERILY THOUGHT THAT IF IT HAD A SOUL IT MUST HAVE GOTTEN INTO THIS MAN ALICIA SAT DOWN AND HE BESIDE HER AND WHEN HE HAD PUT HIS ARMS ABOUT HER HE KISSED HER FACE AND LIPS
SHE BENT HER HEAD FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE LIFTED IT AGAIN AND LOOKED AT ME WITH A SUDDEN CONTRACTION OF HER LEVEL BROWS THAT BETOKENED VEXATION I WISH YOU HADN'T SPOKEN TO ME JUST THEN SHE SAID
MIGHT HE NOT FORGET IN TIME NEED SHE SNAP IN TWAIN THE WEAKENED BOND BETWEEN THEM AFTER ALL PERHAPS SHE MIGHT WIN BACK HER LOST SCEPTRE YET IF WOMANLY PRIDE THROTTLED THE STRUGGLING HOPE
SHE HAD A HABIT OF DROPPING INTO ABSTRACTED REVERIES AT ANY TIME OR PLACE NO MATTER WHERE SHE WAS THIS WHATEVER IT WAS WOULD COME OVER HER SHE WOULD SIT THERE
AND TO SUCH EVEN THE ADMIRATION OF A CHILD IS SWEET THEN SHE LEANED DOWN TO ME UNTIL HER SPLENDID EYES LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO MY DAZZLED ONES
THROUGH WHICH AT FIRST THE BOTTOM OF WHITE SAND GLIMMERED WAVILY BUT AFTERWARDS DEEPENED TO TRANSLUCENT DIM DEPTHS OF GREENNESS HIS HEART THROBBED TUMULTUOUSLY ONCE THE THOUGHT OF MARIAN DRIFTED ACROSS HIS MIND LIKE A CHILL BREATH OF WIND
THANK YOU DEAR SHE SAID GENTLY AS SHE STOOD UP SHE SLIPPED HIS RING FROM HER FINGER AND HELD IT OUT TO HIM HE TOOK IT MECHANICALLY HE STILL FELT DAZED AND UNREAL MARIAN HELD OUT HER HAND
NOR WOULD SHE LET ME KEEP ALICIA'S CHAIN BUT MADE AWAY WITH IT
THEREFORE YOU ARE EITHER FALSE TO HER OR INSULTING TO ME IN EITHER CASE THE COMPANIONSHIP OF MAGDALEN CRAWFORD IS NOT WHAT YOU MUST SEEK GO SHE TURNED AWAY FROM HIM WITH AN IMPERIOUS GESTURE OF DISMISSAL
TO THE SWALLOWS FLUTTERING CRAZILY AGAINST THE TINY PANES
SIDNEY SAID MIRIAM SIMPLY NONSENSE
NOR WAS THE NIGHT BLACKER THAN HIS FACE AND HE TOOK NO HEED OF ME AS I RAN AFTER HIM THINKING SELFISHLY OF THE SWEETMEATS HE HAD PROMISED TO BRING ME BUT I THOUGHT NO MORE OF THEM WHEN I GOT TO THE DOOR OF THE RED ROOM
THERE WAS TO BE MUCH FESTIVITY CHRISTMAS WEEK AND A BALL ON CHRISTMAS EVE AND MY AUNTS HAD PROMISED ME THOUGH NOT TILL I HAD WEARIED THEM OF MY COAXING THAT I SHOULD STAY UP THAT NIGHT AND SEE AS MUCH OF THE GAIETY AS WAS GOOD FOR ME
MISSUS SAUNDERS LISTENED TO HER BUSINESSLIKE DETAILS WITH SURPRISE AND DELIGHT IT IS THE VERY THING SHE SAID HELEN IS SO EAGER FOR THAT PARTY BUT I COULD NOT UNDERTAKE IT MYSELF HER BIRTHDAY IS FRIDAY CAN YOU HAVE EVERYTHING READY BY THEN
AND I ALWAYS HAVE GOOD LUCK NOW TOMORROW MORNING I SHALL GO TO MISSUS SAUNDERS AND OFFER TO FURNISH ALL THE GOOD THINGS FOR HELEN'S BIRTHDAY PARTY AND THEN I'LL ASK MISSUS REEVES AND MISSUS PORTER IF I MAY MAKE THEIR BREAD FOR THEM THAT WILL DO FOR A BEGINNING I LIKE COOKING YOU KNOW
THAT IS ALL I THINK IT WILL BE BEST TO BE BROTHER AND SISTER FOREVER NOTHING MORE ESTERBROOK SPRANG TO HIS FEET MARIAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
AND DRESSED IN MOURNING THESE GIRLS HAD BEEN HER CLOSE FRIENDS ONCE BUT THAT WAS BEFORE THE MITCHELLS HAD LOST THEIR MONEY SINCE THEN LILIAN HAD BEEN CUT BY MANY OF HER OLD CHUMS AND SHE FELT IT KEENLY THE CLERKS IN THE STORE WERE BUSY AND LILIAN SAT DOWN TO WAIT HER TURN
WILL YOU COME BACK TO ME
THE WAY OF THE WINNING OF ANNE JEROME IRVING HAD BEEN COURTING ANNE STOCKARD FOR FIFTEEN YEARS HE HAD BEGUN WHEN SHE WAS TWENTY AND HE WAS TWENTY FIVE AND NOW THAT JEROME WAS FORTY AND ANNE IN A VILLAGE WHERE EVERYBODY KNEW EVERYBODY ELSE'S AGE HAD TO OWN TO BEING THIRTY FIVE
AND SHE LIVED A GAY AND QUITE IRREPROACHABLE LIFE SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD NOT COME TO THE RACES IT WAS SUCH AN IRRITATING ENCOUNTER
ALL COMMINGLED IN A GLARE THAT MADE HER HEAD
INTO THE FACE OF THE MAN WATCHING HER BREATHLESSLY FLASHED A TRIUMPHANT PASSIONATE JOY HE PUT OUT HIS HAND AND GENTLY PUSHED HER DOWN INTO THE SEAT SITTING OPPOSITE HE TOOK UP THE OARS AND PULLED OUT OVER THE SHEET OF SPARKLING BLUE WATER
SHE ANSWERED IN A GRAVELY TROUBLED VOICE
THAT I WAS NO MORE ALLOWED TO GO INTO THE RED ROOM
I MUST SEE WHAT I CAN DO FOR HER BUT HER MANNER SEEMED RATHER REPELLENT DON'T YOU THINK HARDLY RESPONDED ESTERBROOK CURTLY SHE SEEMED SURPRISINGLY DIGNIFIED AND SELF POSSESSED I FANCIED FOR A GIRL IN HER POSITION A PRINCESS COULD NOT HAVE LOOKED AND BOWED MORE ROYALLY
IT WAS ON HER LIPS TO CRY OUT NO PASSIONATELY BUT THE SLENDER SCHOLARLY HAND ON HER SHOULDER WAS TREMBLING WITH THE INTENSITY OF HIS REPRESSED EMOTION HE DID CARE THEN
BUT HAVE YOU THOUGHT IT ALL OUT CAREFULLY THERE WILL BE MANY DIFFICULTIES I KNOW I DON'T EXPECT SMOOTH SAILING RIGHT ALONG AND PERHAPS I'LL FAIL ALTOGETHER BUT SOMEHOW I DON'T BELIEVE I WILL A GREAT MANY OF YOUR OLD FRIENDS WILL THINK
BUT I HAD GOT NO FURTHER THAN THE STEPS WHEN MISSUS MONTRESSOR CAME SWEEPING DOWN THE HALL IN HASTE AND CATCHING ME BY THE ARM PULLED ME BACK AS ROUGHLY AS IF IT HAD BEEN BLUEBEARD'S CHAMBER ITSELF INTO WHICH I WAS VENTURING THEN SEEING MY FACE
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU ARE DOING A WISE THING QUITE SURE SHE ANSWERED WITH A FAINT SMILE I AM NOT ACTING RASHLY I HAVE THOUGHT IT ALL OVER CAREFULLY THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER SO DEAR WE WILL ALWAYS BE FRIENDS
THEY WERE PRETTY YET BUT THE CROW'S FEET ABOUT THEM WERE PLAINLY VISIBLE THERE WERE BRACKETS AROUND HER MOUTH TOO AND HER CHEEKS WERE HOLLOW ANNE SUDDENLY REALIZED AS SHE HAD NEVER REALIZED BEFORE THAT SHE HAD GROWN OLD THAT HER YOUTH WAS LEFT FAR BEHIND
I FOUND MY VOICE AND TOLD HER TRULY THAT I THOUGHT HER BEAUTIFUL BEYOND MY DREAMS OF ANGELS AS INDEED SHE WAS WHEREAT SHE SMILED AS ONE WELL PLEASED THEN MY UNCLE HUGH CAME IN AND THOUGH I THOUGHT
DON'T LOSE IT THEN SAID MISSUS MITCHELL WITH A SMILE WHAT IS IT MY DEAR LILIAN SOBERED HERSELF SAT DOWN BY HER MOTHER'S SIDE AND PROCEEDED TO RECOUNT THE CONVERSATION SHE HAD HEARD IN THE STORE THAT AFTERNOON NOW MOTHER THIS IS WHERE MY BRILLIANT IDEA COMES IN
SHE SAW THE TRACES OF THE STRUGGLE THROUGH WHICH HE HAD PASSED AND KNEW THAT HE HAD COME OFF VICTOR THE KNOWLEDGE MADE HER TASK A LITTLE HARDER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO LET SLIP THE STRAINING CABLE THAN TO CAST IT FROM HER WHEN IT LAY UNRESISTINGLY IN HER HAND FOR AN INSTANT
TOOK ON A WEIRD UNEARTHLY BEAUTY
THERE HAD TO BE AN OLD MAID IN EVERY BIG FAMILY SHE SAID AND SHE WAS NOT GOING TO MARRY JEROME IRVING JUST FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING MISSUS ON HER TOMBSTONE OLD ESEK AND HIS WIFE HAD BEEN PUT AWAY IN THE DEEP MEADOWS BURYING GROUND THE BROAD FERTILE STOCKARD ACRES PASSED INTO ANNE'S POSSESSION
THAT IS BEST SHE ANSWERED AT LAST SLOWLY BEST YES BETTER THAT WE HAD NEVER MET I LOVE YOU YOU KNOW IT WORDS ARE IDLE BETWEEN US
QUITE A FLAVOR OF ROMANCE BY THE WAY DO YOU READ AS MANY NOVELS AS EVER SHE FANCIED THERE WAS MOCKERY IN HIS TONE
I HAVE FOUND IT VERY PLEASANT AND I HAVE BEEN WELL VERY WELL AND YOU HE JOTTED DOWN THE SCORE CAREFULLY BEFORE HE REPLIED I
CLEAR THROUGH THE NOISY CLAMOUR SHRILLED A WOMAN'S CRY AH I HAVE DROPPED MY SCORECARD A MAN IN FRONT OF HER TURNED I HAVE AN EXTRA ONE MADAME WILL YOU ACCEPT IT
BUT MY UNCLE'S WIFE WAS AS LITTLE LIKE TO THEM AS A SUNSET GLOW TO PALE MOONSHINE OR A CRIMSON ROSE TO WHITE DAY LILIES
BUT WHEN I WENT TO THE PLACE MY UNCLE HUGH AND HIS BRIDE WERE GONE FOR A TIME AND I HAD EVEN TO SWALLOW MY DISAPPOINTMENT AND BIDE THEIR RETURN WITH ALL MY SMALL PATIENCE BUT MY AUNTS AND THEIR STEPMOTHER TALKED MUCH OF ALICIA AND THEY SPOKE SLIGHTINGLY OF HER
AND JUST AS REGULARLY ANNE SAID NO A LITTLE MORE BRUSQUELY AND A LITTLE MORE DECIDEDLY EVERY YEAR NOW IN THE MELLOWNESS OF A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD COURTSHIP JEROME DID NOT MIND IT AT ALL HE KNEW THAT EVERYTHING COMES TO THE MAN WHO HAS PATIENCE TO WAIT
AS HE HAD WALKED HOMEWARD THE NIGHT OF THEIR BETROTHAL HE HAD REVIEWED WITH UNCONSCIOUS CRITICISM HIS MENTAL CATALOGUE OF MARIAN'S GRACES AND GOOD QUALITIES ADMITTING WITH SUPREME SATISFACTION THAT THERE WAS NOT ONE THING ABOUT HER THAT HE COULD WISH CHANGED
I AM NOT YOUR EQUAL THERE CAN BE NO FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN US THERE OUGHT NOT TO BE MAGDALEN CRAWFORD THE FISHERMAN'S NIECE IS NO COMPANION FOR YOU YOU WILL BE FOOLISH AS WELL AS DISLOYAL IF YOU EVER TRY TO SEE ME AGAIN
MIRIAM CAME BACK TO LIFE AT LAST WHEN SHE AND I WERE LEFT ALONE SHE TURNED TO ME SIDNEY IS DEAD SHE SAID QUIETLY I SAW HIM JUST BEFORE I FAINTED
SHE SAID HER HEAD ACHED THE DEEP MEADOWS PEOPLE WERE AMUSED AND MADE JOKING REMARKS TO ANNE WHICH SHE HAD TO TAKE AMIABLY BECAUSE SHE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR RESENTING THEM IN REALITY THEY STUNG HER PRIDE UNENDURABLY
HER WHIMS WERE HOW OBSTINATELY SHE CLUNG TO EVEN THE MOST ABSURD SHE LEANED FORWARD BREATHLESSLY THE CROWD HUNG SILENTLY ON THE TRACK
HAD ALL MARRIED WELL SO SAID PEOPLE WHO KNEW AND LIVED NOT FAR AWAY
YOU MUST NOT GO AWAY MAGDALEN YOU MUST STAY HERE WITH ME YOU FORGET YOURSELF SHE SAID PROUDLY HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME SO HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN MISS LESLEY OR ARE YOU A TRAITOR TO US BOTH
THERE'S OLD JEROME GOING HOME FROM SEEING ANNE STOCKARD SAID ONE WONDER WHAT ON EARTH HE'S LAUGHING AT SEEMS TO ME IF I COULDN'T GET A WIFE WITHOUT HOEING A FIFTEEN YEAR ROW I'D GIVE UP TRYING
SINCE COMING HERE I FIND IT OF GREAT SERVICE TO ME SHE STEPPED LIGHTLY INTO THE TINY SHALLOP AND PICKED UP AN OAR THE BRILLIANT SUNSHINE STREAMED ABOUT HER
THE LITTLE POOLS OF WATER ALONG THE LOW SHORES GLOWED LIKE MIRRORS OF POLISHED JACINTH THE SMALL PINE FRINGED HEADLANDS RAN OUT INTO THE WATER CUTTING ITS LUSTROUS BLUE EXPANSE LIKE PURPLE WEDGES
I THINK EVERYONE WHO MET HER FELT THE SAME WAY YET IT WAS A FEELING HARD TO DEFINE FOR MY OWN PART I SIMPLY FELT AS IF SHE BELONGED TO ANOTHER WORLD AND THAT PART OF THE TIME SHE HER SOUL YOU KNOW
THOUGH NOT UNTIL MY SCANTY PATIENCE WAS WELL NIGH WEARIED OUT
WAS BACK THERE AGAIN YOU MUST NOT SUPPOSE THAT MIRIAM WAS A DISAGREEABLE PERSON TO HAVE IN THE HOUSE ON THE CONTRARY IT WAS THE VERY REVERSE EVERYBODY LIKED HER
I DON'T CARE A RAP FOR HARRIET WARREN OR ANYONE BUT YOU NOW THAT'S THE TRUTH RIGHT OUT ANNE NO DOUBT IT WAS AND ANNE WAS CONVINCED OF IT
SUCH A LITTLE BLOW WITH THIS SHE SAID SUCH A LITTLE BLOW AND THE HEART BEATS NO LONGER THE WEARY BRAIN RESTS THE LIPS AND EYES SMILE NEVER AGAIN TWERE A SHORT PATH OUT OF ALL DIFFICULTIES MY BEATRICE
COULD HE NOT HAVE HIS BRIDE IN AUGUST FOR A FLEETING SECOND MARIAN CLOSED HER EYES AND THE SLENDER HANDS LYING AMONG THE LACES IN HER LAP CLASPED EACH OTHER CONVULSIVELY THEN SHE SAID QUIETLY
AND WAVERING OVER THE RICH MASSES OF HER RED GOLD HAIR SHE WAS TALL SO TALL THAT MY AUNTS LOOKED BUT INSIGNIFICANT BESIDE HER AND THEY WERE OF NO MEAN HEIGHT AS BECAME THEIR RACE YET NO QUEEN COULD HAVE CARRIED HERSELF MORE ROYALLY
AND ALL ABOUT HER SNOWY THROAT AND ROUNDED ARMS AND IN THE MASSES OF HER SPLENDID HAIR WERE SPARKLING GLEAMING STONES WITH HEARTS OF PURE LIGHT
I LOOKED UP AND HE WAS STANDING BETWEEN ME AND YOU HE HAD COME TO SAY FAREWELL
SHE WHISPERED BREATHLESSLY AS ONE HALF FASCINATED WE WERE BOTH TO BLAME BUT I THE MOST I WAS TOO HARD ON YOU I OUGHT TO HAVE MADE MORE ALLOWANCE
I'M AFRAID I'VE LIVED A RATHER SELFISH LIFE YOU WILL CHANGE ALL THAT DEAR YOU WILL MAKE A GOOD MAN OF ME YOU ARE THAT NOW ESTERBROOK SHE SAID SOFTLY IF YOU WERE NOT I COULD NOT LOVE YOU
IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL NEVER ASK ANOTHER OF YOU YOUR PEOPLE I KNOW THOSE COLD MONTRESSORS CARE LITTLE FOR ME
SHE WAS ONE OF THE SWEETEST MOST WINSOME GIRLS I EVER KNEW AND I SOON GREW TO LOVE HER DEARLY AS FOR WHAT DICK CALLED HER LITTLE QUEERNESSES'
AND LISTENED TO THE MOAN AND MURMUR OF THE SEA FAR OUT OVER THE BAY WITH SORROWFUL EYES AND STERNLY SET LIPS
AS HAD BEEN MY HABIT TO TALK TO THE SWALLOWS AND MISPLACE NOTHING BUT MISSUS MONTRESSOR SAW TO IT THAT I OBEYED HER AND I WENT NO MORE TO THE RED ROOM BUT BUSIED MYSELF WITH OTHER MATTERS FOR THERE WERE GREAT DOINGS AT THE PLACE AND MUCH COMING AND GOING MY AUNTS WERE NEVER IDLE
WHILE SHE HAD ONE ARM RAISED AS IF TO THRUST HIM BACK AS FOR MY UNCLE HE STOOD BEFORE HER AND I SAW NOT HIS FACE BUT HIS VOICE WAS LOW AND TERRIBLE SPEAKING WORDS I UNDERSTOOD NOT THEN THOUGH LONG AFTERWARDS I CAME TO KNOW THEIR MEANING
NOR DID SHE SHRINK FROM HIS EMBRACE BUT EVEN SMILED AND LEANED NEARER TO HIM WITH A LITTLE SMOOTH MOTION AS THEY TALKED TO EACH OTHER IN SOME STRANGE FOREIGN TONGUE I WAS BUT A CHILD AND INNOCENT NOR KNEW I AUGHT OF HONOUR AND DISHONOUR
JEROME'S HAT WENT ONE WAY AND HIS CANE ANOTHER
AND DARED LOOK NO MORE ONE MAN WITH WHITE FACE AND SET LIPS WATCHED THE TRACK UNSWERVINGLY AGAIN MASCOT CRAWLED UP
MIRIAM WAS A BEAUTY I HAD KNOWN THAT BEFORE THOUGH I THINK I HARDLY EXPECTED TO SEE SUCH WONDERFUL LOVELINESS SHE WAS TALL AND EXTREMELY GRACEFUL
YET I INSTANTLY BETHOUGHT MYSELF OF A LEAN BLACK SNAKE WITH A GLITTERING AND EVIL EYE WHICH I HAD SEEN IN MISSUS MONTRESSOR'S GARDEN TWO SUMMERS AGONE AND WHICH WAS LIKE TO HAVE BITTEN ME
BUT SHE TOOK HER OWN WAY WITH TRUE STOCKARD FIRMNESS AND MATTERS WERE ALLOWED TO DRIFT ON AT THE WILL OF TIME OR CHANCE THREE YEARS LATER JEROME TRIED HIS LUCK AGAIN WITH PRECISELY THE SAME RESULT AND AFTER THAT HE HAD ASKED ANNE REGULARLY ONCE A YEAR TO MARRY HIM
SO GREY AND BLEACHED WERE THEY FROM LONG EXPOSURE TO SEA WINDS AND SPRAY DOZENS OF RAGGED CHILDREN WERE PLAYING ABOUT THEM MINGLED WITH SEVERAL DISREPUTABLE YELLOW CURS THAT YAPPED NOISILY AT THE STRANGERS
YES I THINK SO SAID LILIAN BRISKLY PRODUCING HER NOTEBOOK PLEASE GIVE ME THE LIST OF WHAT YOU WANT AND I WILL DO MY BEST FROM MISSUS SAUNDERS SHE WENT TO MISSUS REEVES AND FOUND A CUSTOMER AS SOON AS SHE HAD TOLD THE REASON OF HER CALL
NOW GO BACK TO YOUR OWN WORLD ESTERBROOK ELLIOTT SLOWLY TURNED FROM HER AND WALKED IN SILENCE BACK TO THE SHORE
THERE WAS NO ONE TO CONSULT BUT THEMSELVES THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED EARLY IN SEPTEMBER AND THEN GO ABROAD ESTERBROOK MAPPED OUT THE DETAILS OF THEIR BRIDAL TOUR WITH CAREFUL THOUGHTFULNESS
ALL THE ROUTED SHADOWS OF THE HOUR HAD FOUND REFUGE IN HER EYES NOT A TRACE OF COLOUR APPEARED IN HER FACE UNDER ESTERBROOK ELLIOTT'S BURNING GAZE BUT WHEN HE SAID MAGDALEN
ALL EYES WERE ON THE TRACK WHICH WAS BEING CLEARED FOR THE FIRST HEAT OF ANOTHER RACE THE FREE FOR ALL HORSES WERE BEING LED AWAY BLANKETED THE CROWD CHEERED LU LU AS SHE WENT PAST A SHAPELESS ODDITY
HIS SUDDEN SPRING HAD SET IT ROCKING VIOLENTLY MAGDALEN ALMOST LOST HER FOOTING AND CAUGHT BLINDLY AT HIS ARM AS HER FINGERS CLOSED ON HIS WRIST A THRILL AS OF FIRE SHOT THROUGH HIS EVERY VEIN
HER HAND WHEN SHE TOOK MINE WAS BURNING HOT AND HER VOICE HAD A STRANGE RING COME LITTLE BEATRICE SHE SAID COME TALK TO ME FOR I KNOW NOT WHAT TO DO WITH MY LONE SELF TODAY TIME HANGS HEAVILY IN THIS GLOOMY HOUSE I DO VERILY THINK THIS RED ROOM HAS AN EVIL INFLUENCE OVER ME
BUT THEN THE SPEAKER WAS A HAMILTON AND THE HAMILTONS NEVER HAD ANY PERSEVERANCE JEROME ALTHOUGH A WELL TO DO MAN OWNING A GOOD FARM HAD SO TO SPEAK NO HOME OF HIS OWN THE OLD IRVING HOMESTEAD BELONGED TO HIS OLDER BROTHER
AGAIN HE ASKED HIMSELF WHAT MADNESS HAD COME OVER HIM AND AGAIN FOR AN ANSWER ROSE UP THE VISION OF MAGDALEN CRAWFORD'S FACE AS HE HAD SEEN IT THAT DAY CRIMSONING BENEATH HIS GAZE IT WAS LATE WHEN HE LEFT
MISSUS BARRETT'S LITTLE BESSIE IS VERY ILL WITH FEVER ANSWERED MARIAN THEN CATCHING HIS ANXIOUS LOOK SHE HASTENED TO ADD IT IS NOTHING INFECTIOUS SOME KIND OF A SLOW SAPPING VARIETY THERE IS NO DANGER ESTERBROOK I WAS NOT AFRAID FOR MYSELF HE REPLIED QUIETLY
MOANED THE LITTLE PLAINTIVE VOICE MAGDALEN CAME OVER AND STOOD BESIDE MARIAN LESLEY SHE WANTS ME SHE SAID IN A LOW THRILLING VOICE FREE FROM ALL HARSH ACCENT OR INTONATION I AM THE ONLY ONE SHE SEEMS TO KNOW ALWAYS
AND FROM THAT HOUR I MISTRUSTED ALICIA THOUGH I UNDERSTOOD NOT THEN WHAT I AFTERWARDS DID AND AS I WATCHED THEM NOT THINKING OF PLAYING THE SPY I SAW HER FACE GROW SUDDENLY COLD AND SHE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF UP AND PUSHED AWAY HER LOVER'S ARMS
AND SHE STARTED VERY PERCEPTIBLY GOOD EVENING ANNE HE SAID EASILY AND UNBLUSHINGLY ANNE CHOKED UP SHE WAS VERY ANGRY OR THOUGHT SHE WAS JEROME APPEARED NOT TO NOTICE HER LACK OF WELCOME HE SAT COOLLY DOWN IN HIS OLD PLACE
HOW THAT GENERATIONS AGONE A MONTRESSOR HAD DISGRACED HIMSELF AND HIS NAME AND THAT WHEN HE CAME HOME TO HIS MOTHER SHE HAD MET HIM IN THAT SAME RED ROOM AND FLUNG AT HIM TAUNTS AND REPROACHES FORGETTING WHOSE BREAST HAD NOURISHED HIM
YOU INTERRUPTED THE MESSAGE I WAS RECEIVING I SHALL NOT GET IT AT ALL NOW MIRIAM I IMPLORED I SO WISH MY DEAR GIRL THAT YOU WOULDN'T TALK SO
AS IF TO SHOW IT WAS NOT DROPPED AS A MERE RANDOM OBSERVATION I HAVE SOME SCRUPLES ABOUT VENTURING TO OFFER ANYTHING BORDERING ON A SUGGESTION TO A GREAT AND WILY DIPLOMATIST LIKE YOURSELF
THERE IS A WONDERFUL SAMENESS OVER THE WORLD JUST NOW PRELUDING I HAVE VERY LITTLE DOUBT SOME GREAT OUTBURST OF NATIONALITY FROM ALL THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE JUST AS PERIODS OF PURITANISM SUCCEED INTERVALS OF GROSS LICENTIOUSNESS
TRUE TO MY PROMISE TO GIVE YOU EARLY TIDINGS OF OUR OLD FRIEND I SIT DOWN TO PEN A FEW LINES WHICH IF A RICKETY TABLE AND SOME INFERNAL LAMPBLACK FOR INK SHOULD MAKE ILLEGIBLE YOU LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE ELUCIDATION TILL MY ARRIVAL
CHEAP PENKNIVES AND SCISSORS PENCIL CASES BODKINS AND THE LIKE AND I WANDERED ABOUT FOR WEEKS THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL THE LAKE COUNTRY A VERY HANDSOME PLACE
BY JOVE DOCTOR I MUST STOP YOU THERE I NEVER HEARD ANY ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THIS INFERIORITY YOU SPEAK OF
HE EVEN SUGGESTED ONE OF THE COLONIES AS THE MEANS OF WITHDRAWING HIM AT ONCE AND FOREVER FROM PUBLIC GAZE YOU HAVE INTERESTED ME MUCH BY WHAT YOU SAY OF THE BOY'S PROGRESS HIS TASTES I INFER LIE IN THE DIRECTION WHICH IN A WORLDLY SENSE ARE LEAST PROFITABLE
FOLLOW ME SAID CRAGGS GIVING A SIGNAL TO STEP LIGHTLY AND HE LED THE WAY UP A NARROW STONE STAIR WITH A WALL ON EITHER HAND
HE WHO WANTS TO BAG HIS BIRD COLONEL NEVER BANGS AWAY AT NOTHING I HAVE NOW COMPLETED A LONGER DESPATCH TO YOU THAN I INTEND TO ADDRESS TO THE NOBLE SECRETARY AT F O AND AM YOURS VERY FAITHFULLY HORACE UPTON
AND IT IS AS WELL MY REST SHOULD REMAIN UNDISTURBED I WISH YOU HAD ANY MEANS OF MAKING IT KNOWN THAT THE ARTICLE IN THE QUARTERLY ON OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS IS NOT MINE THE NEWSPAPERS HAVE COOLLY ASSUMED ME TO BE THE AUTHOR
OF MY COLLEAGUES I SEE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE THOUGH WHEN WE DO MEET I FEEL AN UNBOUNDED AFFECTION FOR THEM SO MUCH FOR MY LIFE DEAR HARCOURT ON THE WHOLE A VERY TOLERABLE KIND OF EXISTENCE
MUTTERED HE AS HE FINISHED AND THEN GENTLY DISPLACING THE BEDCLOTHES LAID HIS HAND UPON THE HEART WITH A LONG DRAWN SIGH LIKE THAT OF UTTER WEARINESS THE SICK MAN MOVED HIS HEAD ROUND AND FIXED HIS EYES UPON HIM
WITH A WEAK FRAME IMAGINATION WILL PLAY THE TYRANT AND NEVER CEASE TILL IT DOMINATES OVER ALL THE OTHER FACULTIES BUT WHERE THERE IS STRENGTH AND ACTIVITY THERE IS NO FEAR OF THIS YOU AMUSE ME WITH YOUR ACCOUNT OF THE DOCTOR
WERE NOW IN DEEP GLOOM FROM EVERY CARRIAGE WINDOW HEADS WERE PROTRUDED WONDERING AT THIS STRANGE SPECTACLE AND EAGER INQUIRIES PASSED ON EVERY SIDE FOR AN EXPLANATION THE EXPLANATION OF SUDDEN ILLNESS WAS RAPIDLY DISSEMINATED
A LETTER WRITTEN BY COLONEL HARCOURT ABOUT A WEEK AFTER HIS ARRIVAL AT GLENCORE WHICH WILL AT LEAST SERVE TO RESCUE HIM AND OURSELVES FROM THE TASK OF REPETITION IT WAS ADDRESSED TO SIR HORACE UPTON
I CAN CONTRIBUTE NOTHING TO HIS RECOVERY AND I FEAR AS LITTLE TO HIS COMFORT I EVEN DOUBT IF HE DESIRES ME TO PROLONG MY VISIT BUT SUCH IS MY FEAR OF OFFENDING HIM THAT I ACTUALLY DREAD TO ALLUDE TO MY DEPARTURE TILL I CAN SOUND MY WAY AS TO HOW HE LL TAKE IT
AND WITH AN APPETITE THAT SHOWED HOW MUCH HE RELISHED IT THIS IS ELEGANT LIVING YE HAVE HERE MISTER CRAGGS SAID BILLY AS HE DRAINED HIS TANKARD OF BEER AND PLACED IT WITH A SIGH ON THE TABLE MANY HAPPY YEARS OF IT TO YE I
IT MAY SEEM SMALL MINDED AND NARROW TO STIGMATIZE SUCH CONDUCT AS THIS SOME MAY SAY THAT FOR THE ORDINARY COURTESIES OF SOCIETY NO PLEDGES OF FRIENDSHIP ARE REQUIRED NO REAL GRATITUDE INCURRED BE IT SO
AND ALL THE WHILE I'M SAYING THE SAME THING TO MYSELF
WELL KNOWING WHAT PRECIOUS CAPRICES OF COSTLY COSTUME WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCE WELL A DISCHARGED CORPORAL IN A CAST OFF MUFTI IS STYLISH COMPARED TO HIM I DON'T THINK HE HAS A HAT
I MUST REALLY HAVE THOSE LARGE SEVRES JARS SAID ONE AND I THE SMALL PARK PHAETON CRIED ANOTHER I HOPE SHE HAS NOT TAKEN HORACE WITH HER HE WAS THE BEST COOK IN ITALY SPLENDID HOCK SHE HAD
AND THERE'S YOUR SUPERIORITY NEITHER MORE OR LESS
MY DUTY ADDED HE SOMEWHAT PRETENTIOUSLY IS TO CARRY THE KING'S MAIL AND IF ANYTHING WAS TO OBSTRUCKT OR IMPADE OR DELAY THE CORRESPONDIENCE IT'S ON ME THE BLAME WOULD LIE
THIS BOY OF GLENCORE'S I RATHER LIKE THE ACCOUNT YOU GIVE OF HIM BETTER THAN YOU DO YOURSELF IMAGINATIVE AND DREAMY HE MAY BE BUT REMEMBER WHAT HE WAS AND WHERE WE HAVE PLACED HIM A MOONSTRUCK ROMANTIC YOUTH AT A GERMAN UNIVERSITY
JUST AS I SUPPOSE THAT YOU'D SAY THAT A SOLDIER IN THE BLUES OR SOME BIG HULKING CORPORAL IN THE GUARDS IS A FINER MODEL OF THE HUMAN FORM THAN EVER PRAXITELES CHISELLED
AND TOP WITH SILVER EVERY MOUNTAIN'S HEAD THEN SHINE THE VALES THE ROCKS IN PROSPECT RISE A FLOOD OF GLORY BURSTS FROM ALL THE SKIES THE CONSCIOUS SWAINS REJOICING IN THE SIGHT
AND MANY A JEALOUS RIVAL WAS NOT SORRY AT THIS HOUR OF HUMILIATION THE DESPOTISM OF BEAUTY IS NOT A VERY MILD SWAY AFTER ALL AND PERHAPS THE COUNTESS HAD EXERCISED HER RULE RIGHT ROYALLY
IT SMACKS OF THE GENTLE BLOOD IN HIS VEINS POOR LAD THERE IS SOMETHING VERY SAD IN HIS CASE YOU NEED NOT HAVE TAKEN SUCH TROUBLE ABOUT ACCOUNTS AND EXPENDITURE OF COURSE WHATEVER YOU HAVE DONE I PERFECTLY APPROVE OF
THE OTHER WAS COLD CAUTIOUS AND RESERVED WHERE ONE BELIEVED THE OTHER DOUBTED WHERE ONE WAS HOPEFUL THE OTHER HAD NOTHING BUT MISGIVINGS
YOU LL NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF SUCH A LENGTHY EPISTLE FROM ME AND YOU LL DOUBTLESS TORTURE THAT FINE DIPLOMATIC INTELLIGENCE OF YOURS TO DETECT THE SECRET MOTIVE OF MY LONG WINDEDNESS BUT THE SIMPLE FACT IS IT HAS RAINED INCESSANTLY FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS
I FOUND GLENCORE TERRIBLY ALTERED
SOME ENDEAVORING TO TURN BACK WHILE OTHERS PRESSED FORWARD THE COURT OF THE PALACE BEING CLOSELY PACKED WITH CARRIAGES WHICH THE THRONGED STREET HELD IN FAST BLOCKADE AS THE APARTMENTS WHICH FACED THE STREET WERE NOT EVER USED FOR THESE RECEPTIONS
JUST AS HE MAY HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE BY OBSERVATION WHAT IS SICKNESS AFTER ALL BUT JUST ONE OF THE PHENOMENONS OF ALL ORGANIC AND INORGANIC MATTER A REGULAR SORT OF SHINDY IN A MAN'S INSIDE LIKE A THUNDERSTORM OR A HURRY CANE OUTSIDE
RUNNING OUT INTO THE LAKE AND THERE WAS TWO ISLANDS ALL WOODED TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND BEHIND ALL IN THE DISTANCE WAS A GREAT MOUNTAIN WITH CLOUDS ON THE TOP AND IT WAS JUST THE SEASON WHEN THE TREES IS BEGINNIN TO CHANGE THEIR COLORS
NOT ONE HOWEVER SINCERELY PROFESSED THAT HE DISBELIEVED IT CAN IT BE AS THE FRENCH MORALIST ASSERTS THAT WE HAVE A LATENT SENSE OF SATISFACTION IN THE MISFORTUNES OF EVEN OUR BEST FRIENDS OR IS IT
AND BILLY OBEYED WITHOUT SPEAKING WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS CRAGGS SAID THE VISCOUNT TREMBLING WITH PASSION WHO HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME WHAT BEGGAR HAVE YOU PICKED OFF THE HIGHWAY OR IS HE THE TRAVELLING FOOL OF THE DISTRICT
GO ON GO ON CRIED SHE IMPATIENTLY I WISH TO HEAR IT ALL ALL IS VERY BRIEFLY RELATED THEN SAID HE
AND IF THEY HAD ANY WIT IN THEIR HEADS
HIS MANNER WAS HEARTIER AND IN HIS WELCOME THERE WAS A TOUCH OF THE OLD JOVIAL GOOD FELLOW WHO NEVER WAS SO HAPPY AS WHEN SHARING HIS QUARTERS WITH A COMRADE SINCE THAT HE HAS GROWN PUNCTILIOUS ANXIOUSLY ASKING ME IF I AM COMFORTABLE
WHEN I HAVEN'T TUPPENCE TO BUY TOBACCO AND WITHOUT A SHOE TO MY FOOT AND MY HAIR THROUGH MY HAT I CAN BE DANCIN WID PRINCESSES AND HANDIN EMPRESSES IN TO TAY MUSHA MUSHA
WITH BRAINS REDUCED A DOABLE DEBT TO PAY TO DREAM BY NIGHT SELL SHEFFIELD WARE BY DAY WELL WITH THAT HE TOOK A FIT OF LAUGHING AND HANDING THE REST OUT OF THE BOAT
I SUPPOSE HE LOOKS ON ME AS RATHER A ROUGH FATHER TO CONFESS TO HE IS N'T QUITE SURE WHAT KIND OF SYMPATHY IF ANY HE LL MEET WITH FROM ME AND HE MORE THAN HALF DREADS A CERTAIN CARELESS OUTSPOKEN WAY IN WHICH I HAVE NOW AND THEN ADDRESSED HIS BOY
MUTTERED THE PRINCESS I'LL TELL YOU THEN
AT ALL EVENTS IT WAS THE YOUNG AND THE GOOD LOOKING WHO VOTED HER EXCLUSION AND ONLY THOSE WHO COULD NOT ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH HER CHARMS WHO TOOK THE CHARITABLE SIDE THEY DISCUSSED AND DEBATED THE QUESTION ALL DAY
WHEN YOU FIND YOURSELF DEAD BATE AND NOT A WORD TO REPLY YOU LL GO HOME TO A GOOD DINNER AND A BOTTLE OF WINE DRY CLOTHES AND A BRIGHT FIRE AND NO MATTER HOW HARD MY ARGUMENT PUSHED YOU YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT I'M IN RAGS
THE ARTIST THAT MADE IT ALL JUST WANTED TO SHOW YOU WHERE EVERYTHING WAS BUT HE NEVER WANTED YOU TO BELIEVE IT WAS ALIVE OR EVER HAD BEEN BUT WITH JANIUS IT'S DIFFERENT
AS BILLY FINISHED HIS GROWING PANEGYRIC UPON HIS COUNTRY AND HIMSELF HE BURST OUT IN A JOYOUS LAUGH AND CRIED DID YE EVER HEAR CONCEIT LIKE THAT DID YE EVER EXPECT TO SEE THE DAY
BRITISH LEGATION NAPLES MY DEAR HARCOURT
THE FELLOW WHO WROTE IT MUST BE AN ASS
SAID HE AS HE SEATED HIMSELF AND A FINE YOUNG CRAYTURE TOO PUER INGENUUS WITH A GRAND FRONTAL DEVELOPMENT AND WITH THIS REFLECTION HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE COARSE BUT ABUNDANT FARE WHICH CRAGGS PLACED BEFORE HIM
AND BENT NEARLY DOUBLE HIS VOICE TOO THE MOST CLEAR AND RINGING IN THE SQUADRON IS BECOME A HOARSE WHISPER YOU REMEMBER WHAT A PASSION HE HAD FOR DRESS AND HOW HEARTILY WE ALL DEPLORED THE CHANCE OF HIS BEING COLONEL
BREATHING HEAVILY CAN YOU DO NOTHING FOR HIM ASKED CRAGGS PEEVISHLY NOTHING BUT ANGER HIM TO BE SURE I CAN IF YOU LET ME
SINCE ALL IS GOING ON SO WELL ABOVE STAIRS I'LL DRAW YOU A GALLON OF ALE BOYS AND WE LL DRINK TO THE MASTER'S SPEEDY RECOVERY IT WAS A RARE OCCASION WHEN THE CORPORAL SUFFERED HIMSELF TO EXPAND IN THIS FASHION AND GREAT WAS THE APPLAUSE AT THE UNEXPECTED MUNIFICENCE
HANG ME BUT GOOD HOUSES AND GOOD COOKS ARE GROWING TOO SCARCE TO MAKE ONE CREDULOUS OF THE ILLS THAT CAN BE SAID OF THEIR OWNERS
BUT WHILE THEY HESITATED OVER THE REPRIEVE THE PRISONER WAS BEYOND THE LAW THE GATE OF THE PALACE LOCKED AND BARRED ALL DAY REFUSED ENTRANCE TO EVERY ONE AT NIGHT IT OPENED TO ADMIT THE EXIT OF A TRAVELLING CARRIAGE
NOR ASK YOU TO LISTEN TO SPECULATIONS WHICH EVEN THOSE IN AUTHORITY TURN A DEAF EAR TO IT IS VERY KIND OF YOU TO THINK OF MY HEALTH I AM STILL A SUFFERER THE OLD PAINS RATHER AGGRAVATED THAN RELIEVED BY THIS CLIMATE
LIKE WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN IRELAND MORE WOOD FOREST TIMBER AND BETTER OFF PEOPLE BUT NOTHING BEYOND THAT WELL ONE EVENING IT WAS IN AUGUST I CAME DOWN BY A NARROW PATH TO THE SIDE OF A LAKE WHERE THERE WAS A STONE SEAT
AND MY FIDDLE TO AMUSE ME AND I WOULD N'T CHANGE WITH THE KING OF SUGAR CANDY I WAS THERE SAID CRAGGS IT'S A FINE ISLAND MY LORD WANTS TO SEE THE DOCTOR SAID A WOMAN ENTERING HASTILY AND THE DOCTOR IS READY FOR HIM
SENTENTIOUSLY AND WHY SO BECAUSE SAID HE DRAWING A LONG BREATH AS IF PREPARING FOR A DISCOURSE BECAUSE THERE'S NO MAN CAPABLE OF GOING INTO THE WHOLE SUBJECT
BUT I DO NOT MEAN TO AVAIL MYSELF OF THE POLITENESS
AND BLENDED IN WITH THE SLIGHT SPLASH OF OARS THAT MOVED THROUGH THE WATER CAREFULLY AS THOUGH NOT TO LOSE A WORD OF HIM THAT WAS SPEAKIN IT'S CLEAN BEYOND ME TO TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID AND MAYBE IF I COULD
AND MANY A WITTY EPIGRAM AND SMART SPEECH WERE LAUNCHED OVER A DISASTER WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN SPARED SUCH LEVITY AT LENGTH THE SPACE SLOWLY BEGAN TO THIN SLOWLY CARRIAGE AFTER CARRIAGE DROVE OFF
I HAVE A FEW WHO COME WHEN I WANT THEM AND GO IN LIKE MANNER THEY TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON FAR BETTER AND MORE TRUTHFULLY THAN PAID EMPLOYEES AND THEY CANNOT TRACE MY INTENTIONS THROUGH MY INQUIRIES AND HASTEN OFF TO RETAIL THEM AT THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS
HE JUST GIVES YOU SOME TRAITS OF A CHARACTER HE POINTS HIM OUT TO YOU PASSING JUST AS I WOULD TO A MAN GOING ALONG THE STREET
HE TURNED TO THE CORPORAL AND SAID LOOK TO HIM CRAGGS AND LET HIM HAVE HIS SUPPER AND WHEN HE HAS EATEN IT SEND HIM TO MY ROOM BILLY BOWED AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND FOLLOWED THE CORPORAL TO THE KITCHEN THAT'S MY LORD'S SON I SUPPOSE
POOR FELLOW HE LOOKS VERY ILL TO DAY HE SAYS THAT HE NEVER SLEPT THE WHOLE NIGHT AND THAT THE LAUDANUM HE TOOK TO INDUCE DROWSINESS ONLY EXCITED AND MADDENED HIM I COUNSELLED A HOT JORUM OF MULLED PORTER BEFORE GETTING INTO BED
THAT AS WE READ EVERY CHARACTER TO ELICIT TRUTH TRUTH IN THE WORKING OF HUMAN MOTIVES TRUTH IN PASSION
SAID BILLY AND AFTER ALL I DON'T SEE HOW IT WOULD RESOLVE THE ORIGINAL DOUBT SAID HARCOURT I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE PEOPLE ARE SO POOR
I'LL BACK HIS CHAMBERTIN AGAINST YOUR EXCELLENCY'S AND I HAVE DISCOVERED A BIN OF RED HERMITAGE THAT WOULD CONVERT A WHOLE VINEYARD OF THE SMALLEST LAFITTE
IN FACT IT POSSESSED THE GREATEST OF ALL CLAIMS TO THEIR ADMIRATION FOR IT WAS PARTLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND BY THE ARTFUL INTRODUCTION OF A WORD HERE AND THERE OF WHICH HIS HEARERS KNEW NOTHING
THE DARK UNLIGHTED WINDOWS SUGGESTED NO REMARK BUT THEY WHO HAD ENTERED THE COURTYARD WERE STRUCK BY THE GLOOMY ASPECT OF THE VAST BUILDING NOT ONLY THAT THE ENTRANCE AND THE STAIRS WERE IN DARKNESS BUT THE WHOLE SUITE OF ROOMS USUALLY BRILLIANT AS THE DAY
WHY MAN THE ONE IS AS UNREAL AS THE OTHER THE FELLOW THAT CREATED HIM FASHIONED HIS THOUGHTS AS WELL AS HIS ACTIONS
WHEN NOT A BREATH DISTURBS THE DEEP SERENE AND NOT A CLOUD O'ERCASTS THE SOLEMN SCENE AROUND HER THRONE THE VIVID PLANETS ROLL AND STARS UNNUMBERED GILD THE GLOWING POLE O'ER THE DARK TREES A YELLOWER VERDURE SHED
IF I THOUGHT MYSELF OF ANY USE BUT I CANNOT PERSUADE MYSELF THAT I AM SUCH GLENCORE IS NOW ABOUT AGAIN FEEBLE OF COURSE AND MUCH PULLED DOWN BUT ABLE TO GO ABOUT THE HOUSE AND THE GARDEN
THAT'S WHAT PITT MEANT WHEN HE SAID LET ME MAKE THE SONGS OF A PEOPLE AND I DON'T CARE WHO MAKES THE LAWS LOOK DOWN NOW IN THAT GLEN BEFORE YOU AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S BELMULLET AND AIN'T YOU GLAD TO BE SO NEAR YOUR JOURNEY'S END
SAID BILLY WITH A DEGREE OF CONFUSION THAT RAISED A HEARTY LAUGH AT HIS EXPENSE WELL BUT WHERE'S THE SONG EXCLAIMED ANOTHER AY SAID CRAGGS WE ARE FORGETTING THE SONG NOW FOR IT BILLY
BUT NOBODY REFLECTS ON THE SINTRY THAT DIES AT HIS POST IF YOU MUST AND WILL GO I'LL GIVE YOU THE YAWL SAID CRAGGS AND I LL GO WITH YOU MYSELF SPOKE LIKE A BRITISH GRENADIER CRIED BILLY WITH ENTHUSIASM
BUT AFTER ALL HARCOURT EVERY ONE HAS BRAINS ENOUGH AND TO SPARE FOR ANY CAREER LET US ONLY DECIDE UPON THAT ONE MOST FITTED FOR HIM AND DEPEND UPON IT HIS FACULTIES WILL DAY BY DAY CONFORM TO HIS DUTIES AND HIS TASTES BE MERELY DISSIPATIONS
TO A LONG AGONY OF TORTURE DO WRITE TO HIM THEN THE ADDRESS IS GLENCORE CASTLE LEENANE IRELAND WHERE I SUPPOSE I SHALL BE STILL A RESIDENT FOR ANOTHER FORTNIGHT TO COME
HAVE THEIR PECULIAR SPHERES OF USEFULNESS AND GOOD AND DOUBTLESS THESE SAME LOUNGERS CONTRIBUTE IN SOME MYSTERIOUS MANNER TO THE WELFARE OF THAT STATE WHICH THEY ONLY SEEM TO BURDEN
IT CHEERS ONE TO COME UP OUT OF THOSE DREARY DELLS AND HEAR THE PLEASANT PLASH OF THE SEA SAID HARCOURT AND HIS BRIGHT FACE SHOWED THAT HE FELT THE ENJOYMENT SO IT DOES SIR SAID BILLY AND YET
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER FIRST WHO AND WHAT ARE THE ABORIGINES A CONQUERED PEOPLE THAT NEVER GAVE IN THEY WERE CONQUERED WHO ARE THE RULERS A SAXON RACE THAT ALWAYS FELT THAT THEY WERE INFARIOR TO THEM THEY RULED OVER
ASKED THE CORPORAL OF A WOMAN WHO WITH BARE FEET AND DRESSED IN THE HUMBLEST FASHION OF THE PEASANTRY APPEARED HE'S GETTING WEAKER AND WEAKER SIR I BELIEVE HE'S SINKING I'M GLAD IT'S BILLY IS COME I'D RATHER SEE HIM THAN ALL THE DOCTORS IN THE COUNTRY
FOR IT'S NOT MERELY AN ECONOMICAL QUESTION OR A SOCIAL ONE BUT IT IS METAPHYSICAL AND RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL AND ETHNOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL AY AND GEOGRAPHICAL TOO
IS IT YOU SAID HE WITH A QUIET LAUGH THAT ACCUSES POPE OF A BULL IT IS SAYS I AND WHAT'S MORE THERE ISN'T A POET FROM HORACE DOWNWARDS THAT I WON'T SHOW BULLS IN THERE'S BULLS IN SHAKSPEARE AND IN MILTON
BUT THE ANGER THAT SUPPLIED STRENGTH HITHERTO NOW FAILED TO IMPART ENERGY AND HE SANK BACK WASTED AND EXHAUSTED THE CORPORAL BENT OVER HIM AND SPOKE SOMETHING IN A LOW WHISPER BUT WHETHER THE WORDS WERE HEARD OR NOT THE SICK MAN NOW LAY STILL
YES YES BUT I REPEAT THAT THIS IS AN INFAMOUS CALUMNY SHE A COUNTESS OF A FAMILY SECOND TO NONE IN ALL ITALY
BUT DEPEND UPON IT HE'S NOT THE MAN WE KNEW HIM HEAVEN KNOWS IF HE EVER WILL BE SO AGAIN THE NIGHT I ARRIVED HERE HE WAS MORE NATURAL MORE LIKE HIMSELF IN FACT THAN HE HAS EVER BEEN SINCE
THAT COULD N'T COMPOSE YOU TEN HEXAMETERS IF YE'D PUT THEM ON A HOT GRIDDLE FOR IT AND THERE'S OTHERS THAT WOULD TALK RHYME RATHER THAN RAYSON AND SO WITH THE ARS MEDICATRIX EVERYBODY HAS N'T AN EYE FOR A HECTIC OR AN EAR FOR A COUGH NON CONTIGIT
MARGARET'S FEELINGS SEEMED FOR THE MOMENT TO BE TOO STRONG FOR SPEECH I PERCEIVED THE THING HAD BEEN A FAILURE STILL I ENDEAVOURED TO PASS IT OFF WHICH WAS DIFFICULT FOR I MYSELF FELT REALLY ILL
THE PROPOSITION THUS REFUSED WILL NOT BE MADE AGAIN IT ONLY REMAINS FOR ME TO CONTINUE EARNESTLY MY ENDEAVOURS TO RETRIEVE MY CHARACTER UNTIL THE THREE MONTHS ARE AT AN END
PYBUS TOLD SOME PLEASANT AND CHARACTERISTIC ANECDOTES ABOUT INJURIOUS EFFECTS OF PATENT MEDICINES HOW HE HAD KNOWN WHOLE FAMILIES KILLED BY TAKING THEM HOW MORE THAN HALF THE INFANT MORTALITY OF GREAT BRITAIN WAS OWING TO THEIR UNRESTRICTED SALE
THERE WAS AGAIN A SUSPICION OF A SMILE IN HIS EYES AND ABOUT THE CORNERS OF HIS LIPS HIS BEARING WAS IN STRIKING CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE OFFICIALS HIS SELF POSSESSION IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR EVIDENT UNEASINESS
NOW HE HAD ON A BRIGHT RED FLANNEL SHIRT HIS TASTES IN COSTUME SEEMED A TRIFLE LURID THE SLEEVES OF WHICH WERE TURNED UP ABOVE THE ELBOWS HIS POSE WAS ALMOST AS PECULIAR AS HIS COSTUME HE STOOD BOLT UPRIGHT
BUT HIS PARTNER TOOK CARE TO MAKE HIM RUN AN INCREDIBLY LARGE ODD NUMBER AS A WIND UP TO EVERY OVER MISTER BENYON DID NOT SEEM TO BE DISTRESSED BY THE EXERTION IN THE LEAST MISTER BARKER EMPHATICALLY DID
THE SOONEST MENDED AND IF YOU DON'T MIND I WILL GO AND GET MYSELF SOMETHING TO EAT BEING HUNGRY AND HAVING I AM THANKFUL TO SAY MONEY OF MY OWN WITH WHICH TO PAY FOR IT
IT WAS HE WHO TEMPORARILY USURPING THE GOVERNOR'S FUNCTIONS ADDRESSED THE PRISONER YOUR NAME IS OLIVER MANKELL THE PRISONER MERELY SMILED
HOW MUCH DID HE GIVE HER FOR IT HALF A CROWN
SAID MISTER HEWETT HE DID SO FOR THE BENEFIT PROBABLY OF SLATER AND MISTER MURRAY SUPPOSING WE WERE TO SIGN THAT DOCUMENT WHAT WOULD YOU PROPOSE TO DO WITH IT INQUIRED THE GOVERNOR
A SUSPICION THAT A MAN MIGHT BE SO REGARDED HAD BEEN DAWNING UPON ME EVER SINCE I ARRIVED IN INDIA BUT UNTIL I CAME TO AHMEDNUGGER
THE CHAPLAIN PULLED UP HIS WORDS AND MANNER THOUGH EVIDENTLY SINCERE WERE NOT PARTICULARLY IMPRESSIVE WHILE THEY EVIDENTLY HAD THE EFFECT OF INCREASING HIS COLLEAGUES UNEASINESS THEY ONLY HAD THE EFFECT OF ENLARGING THE PRISONER'S SMILE
OR HIS GHOST WHAT WAS MORE SOME OF OUR OWN TEAM TOOK COURAGE AND LEG BAIL I CAUGHT ONE OF THEM THE LAD FENNING IN THE ACT OF SCRAMBLING THROUGH THE HEDGE BUT I HAD NOT THE HEART TO STOP HIM I ONLY WISHED THAT I HAD BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO HAVE LED THE VAN
WE WILL THINK THE MATTER OVER THE PRISONER DROPPED HIS HANDS TO HIS SIDES LOOKING THE GOVERNOR STEADILY IN THE FACE SIR I CONCEIVE THAT ANSWER TO CONVEY A NEGATIVE
FOR MY CHARACTER'S SAKE I AM BUT BEGINNING YOU PERCEIVE OH YOU'RE BUT BEGINNING YOU CALL THIS BUT BEGINNING DO YOU MAY I ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY INTENTION OF GOING ON
HOW THE HABIT OF TAKING PATENT MEDICINES WAS WORSE THAN THE HABIT OF DRAM DRINKING
WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN THE MAJOR HE ADDED GOVERNOR OF HIS OWN ACCORD NOW DOCTOR IT IS YOU THE DOCTOR THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS TROUSERS POCKETS I'LL SIGN IF YOU'LL TELL ME HOW IT IS DONE
PATENT MEDICINES GENERALLY DO
I WAS THAT FRIGHTENED AND I GOT INTO A CAB JUST AS I WAS
WHEN IS THE MATCH TO BE I ASKED TO MORROW WAS THE STARTLING REPLY I WAS SPEECHLESS THAT I AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS TOTAL ABSTENTION
CRACK SMACK WHACK WENT THE BALLS OUT OF SIGHT IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND FOR EACH BALL THAT DISAPPEARED MISTER BENYON PRODUCED ANOTHER FROM HIS BREECHES POCKET I FELT THAT THESE THINGS MUST BE HAPPENING TO ME IN A DREAM
UNWISE TO ENABLE HIM TO BAT WITH MORE ADVANTAGE MISTER BENYON HAD REMOVED HIS WAISTCOAT WHICH MATCHED HIS TROUSERS AND HIS COAT WHAT HE HAD DONE WITH IT I CANNOT SAY
AND AS IT SEEMED SILLY FOR ME TO STAND WHILST HE WAS SITTING I SAT DOWN LIKEWISE SO THERE WE SAT NEITHER OF US SAYING NOTHING TILL I BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE DAMP
BUT I CONCEIVED
THEY'VE GOT HOLD OF PRETTY WELL EVERY BLESSED MAG I HAD I DID NOT ENCOURAGE MISTER JOHNS QUITE THE CONTRARY
TELL YOU HOW IT IS DONE HOW WHAT IS DONE HOW YOU DO THAT HANKY PANKY OF COURSE HANKY PANKY THE PRISONER DREW HIMSELF STRAIGHT UP
A SUBSTITUTE THE STORY OF MY LAST CRICKET MATCH CHAPTER ONE
I SUPPOSE A MORE UNPROMISING SET OF FIELDSMEN NEVER YET TOOK THEIR PLACES IN THE FIELD THE LATCHMERE MEN WENT SLOUCHING TOWARDS THE TENT SOME OF THEM I NOTICED INSTEAD OF GOING IN STOLE TOWARDS THE REAR
WHICH HAS BEEN INVENTED AND FOUND ME WANTING IN THEM ALL THEY EXAMINED ME AS A RIDER AS A DRIVER
HE HAS NEVER GIVEN ME NOTHING WHICH HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO PAY FOR NOT EVEN HALF A PINT OF BEER SO I WAS NOT SURPRISED WHEN HE SAID THE FACT IS MATILDA' WHICH IS ME
THE GOVERNOR LEANED BACK IN HIS SEAT YOUR SUGGESTION HAS AT LEAST THE FORCE OF NOVELTY I SHOULD LIKE TO SEARCH THE REGISTERS OF REMARKABLE CASES
THEN HE GAVE HIMSELF ANOTHER KIND OF SHAKE WHICH I TOOK AS A SIGN THAT HIS COURAGE WAS RUNNING DOWN FOR BOTH THE TWO OF US THAT MADE ME FAIRLY WILD IT REALLY DID TO THINK THAT HE HAD PROMISED TO TAKE ME SOMEWHERE
YOUR CHARACTER WHAT DO YOU MEAN IN THE FIRST INTERVIEW WITH WHICH YOU FAVOURED ME I VENTURED TO OBSERVE THAT IT WOULD BE MY ENDEAVOUR DURING MY SOJOURN WITHIN THESE WALLS TO ACT UPON THE ADVICE
REMINDED ME OF MY DUTIES AS A CAPTAIN NOW THEN TURN OUT SEND YOUR MEN INTO THE FIELD WE CAN'T STOP HERE ALL DAY I'M FIRST MAN IN
SPIRITS OF THE AIR IN WHOSE PRESENCE I NOW STAND I ASK YOU IF I AM NOT JUSTIFIED IN WHATEVER I MAY DO HIS VOICE WAS VERY MUSICAL
THREE MONTHS HARD LABOUR THE PRISONER SMILED AGAIN FOR FOR PRETENDING TO TELL FORTUNES THE SMILE BECAME MORE PRONOUNCED THE CHAPLAIN CLEARED HIS THROAT OLIVER MANKELL I AM A CLERGYMAN
BUT IT ISN'T MINE AND AS I DON'T WANT TO HAVE NO MORE TO DO WITH YOU MISTER EVANS PERHAPS YOU WILL BE SO KIND AS TO LET ME GO BUT HE HOLDS ON TO ME ALL THE TIGHTER AND HE SAYS I TELL YOU WHAT MATILDA
WHEN HE CHALLENGED ME TO SEE WHO COULD SMASH MOST GLASS BALLS WITH A RIFLE BULLET HE OR I I RASHLY TOOK HIS CHALLENGE UP I FLATTERED MYSELF THAT AT LAST I HAD A SOFT THING ON
HURRY UP SIR DON'T I TELL YOU THAT SOON I'LL HAVE TO GO I HURRIED UP I GAVE HIM AN OVERHAND FULL PITCH WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE A DECENT CATCH FOR POINT IF POINT HAD BEEN CLOSE IN WHICH HE WASN'T HOWEVER IN ANY CASE MISTER BENYON WOULD HAVE SAVED HIM THE TROUBLE
MISTER BENYON URGED THE FIELDERS ON HURRY UP BILL HEDGES MISTER HEDGES DID NOT HURRY UP HE NEVER COULD HAVE HURRIED UP EVEN IF HIS MANNER OF FIELDING THE BALL HAD NOT WHOLLY DEPRIVED HIM OF HIS WIND BUT THE BALL WAS AT LAST THROWN IN
I DO LIKE YOUR KIND OF BOWLING MISTER HE OBSERVED WHEN AS USUAL HE SENT MY FIRST BALL OUT OF SIGHT NEVER MIND ABOUT THE BALL I'VE GOT ONE IN MY POCKET YOU CAN HAVE HE HAD HE PRODUCED IT ALWAYS FROM THE SAME POCKET IT WAS ABOUT THE SECOND THOUSAND
WELL I SAID THAT'S A NICE THING TO PROMISE TO TAKE ME OUT AND THEN TO HAVE NO MONEY SO HE SAID IF YOU WAS TO PAY THE EXPENSES FOR BOTH THE TWO OF US IT MIGHT MAKE THINGS MORE PLEASANT SO I SAID
ESPECIALLY BY A STRANGER AND ESPECIALLY BY A STRANGER LIKE THIS STRANGER HE WAS A SHORT UNDERSIZED MAN
MARGARET A GLASS OF AUNT JANE'S JALAP BUT GEORGE I ASSURE YOU THAT I NEVER DO TAKE MEDICINE SOME PEOPLE'S WINE IS NO BETTER THAN MEDICINE WE DRINK THAT AND PRETEND WE LIKE IT WHY NOT JALAP
SAID THE GOVERNOR THUS URGED THE MAJOR DID READ IT GOOD LORD HE GASPED AND PASSED IT TO THE DOCTOR THE DOCTOR SILENTLY HAVING READ IT PASSED IT TO THE CHAPLAIN I WILL READ IT ALOUD
THE THING GREW SERIOUS SO FAR AS I COULD SEE MISTER HAWTHORN MISTER HEDGES MISTER SAPSWORTH AND I WERE THE ONLY MEMBERS OF THE STORWELL TEAM LEFT ON THE GROUND AND THE REFLECTION INVOLUNTARILY CROSSED MY MIND WHAT FOOLS WE WERE TO STAY
I ALWAYS PLACED A LITERAL INTERPRETATION ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH CHAPTER OF THE FIRST BOOK OF SAMUEL IT IS SINGULAR HOW MY FAITH IS JUSTIFIED
TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RETRIEVE MY CHARACTER IN SO SHORT A SPACE OF TIME THEY WATCHED HIM A LITTLE SPELLBOUND PERHAPS AND AS THEY WATCHED HIM
BUT I LET IT PASS MILLIONS LITERALLY MILLIONS HAVE BEEN MADE
BUT WITH ICE PUDDING IT'S A FAILURE NEVER DECLARED MISSUS CHALMERS WHO WAS LEANING BACK IN HER CHAIR AND HAD HER HANDKERCHIEF IN HER HAND NEVER DID I TASTE ANYTHING LIKE IT NEVER AND AFTER DINNER TOO
I NEVER SET EYES ON THEM AGAIN MISTER TRENTHAM I I CAN'T BOWL WHISPERED MISTER SAPSWORTH TO ME AS WE MOVED ACROSS THE TURF HE AND I HAD AGREED THAT WE SHOULD START THE BOWLING
THAT I HAD SOME NOTION AT ANY RATE OF ENGLISH BILLIARDS AND OF A HAZARD OFF THE RED
I THOUGHT SO TOO BUT SHE WENT ON MY YOUNG MAN HIS NAME IS WILLYUM EVANS IS A BAKER AND HIM AND ME HAVE BEEN WALKING OUT TOGETHER FOUR YEARS COME NEXT MONTH SO I SAID TO HIM
I SHOULD GO THE GOVERNOR'S JAW DROPPED GO OH WOULD YOU MY CHARACTER REGAINED FOR WHAT HAVE I TO STOP EXACTLY WHAT HAVE YOU
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN QUITE A USUAL THING TO SEE IN A MATCH A MEMBER OF ONE TEAM ORDERING ABOUT THE CAPTAIN OF THE OTHER I DO NOT THINK THAT OUR FIELD WAS ARRANGED ON SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES I MAY CERTAINLY CLAIM THAT I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ITS ARRANGEMENT
HE DREW ONE OUT AND THREW IT UP TO ME MY SECOND BALL WAS A COLOURABLE IMITATION OF MY FIRST ONLY THIS TIME IT WAS WIDE TO LEG TO LONG LEG MISTER BENYON SENT IT FLYING PUT DOWN TOM BENYON ANOTHER SIX HE CRIED I DO LIKE YOUR BOWLING MISTER
IT'S NOT LOUD ENOUGH FOR ME I LIKE A BAND AS I CAN HEAR ONE SUSPECTED THERE MIGHT BE OCCASIONS ON WHICH ONE COULD ALMOST LIKE A BAND WHICH ONE COULD NOT HEAR BUT I DID NOT SAY SO THAT BROKE THE ICE
THE MAGISTRATE TENDERED ME WHAT
HEARING OF A FAMILY BEING POISONED BY AN OVERDOSE OF JALAP IN THEIR CASE THEY TOOK IT BY MISTAKE THOUGH JUDGING FROM THE TASTE OF YOUR JALAP I CAN'T SEE HOW THAT COULD BE
BUT THESE VAIN DELUSIONS WERE SCATTERED AT ONCE AND FOR EVER BY THE MEN OF AHMEDNUGGER MY ALL ROUND PURBLIND INSENSATE IGNORANCE HAD BEEN SO CONVINCINGLY DISPLAYED THAT
IN DISTRUSTING HIS MAGIC POWERS AND SO CASTING A STAIN UPON HIS CHARACTER THIS IS TO TESTIFY THAT HE HAS PROVED TO THE ENTIRE SATISFACTION OF THE UNDERSIGNED INSPECTOR OF PRISONS
THE SAME PHENOMENON WAS OBSERVABLE IN THE CHIEF WARDER WHO FOLLOWED CLOSE UPON THE PRISONER'S HEELS MANKELL SEEMED AS EVER COMPLETELY AT HIS EASE
HE CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH WHAT HE CALLED SNICKING THAT'S WHAT I CALL A PRETTY SNICK HE SAID THE SNICK IN QUESTION WAS A TREMENDOUS DRIVE TO DEEP MID OFF IT WAS STOPPED QUITE INVOLUNTARILY BY MISTER HAWTHORN AND MISTER HEDGES
WITH A TESTIMONIAL OLIVER MANKELL WAS AGAIN IN THE CHARGE OF WARDER SLATER WARDER SLATER LOOKED VERY QUEER INDEED HE ACTUALLY SEEMED TO HAVE LOST IN BULK
HAVE SUCH A THING AS A CRICKET BALL IN ONE OF THE POCKETS
SQUARE IT OFF I SUSPECT SHE MEANT
I HAVE A BOTTLE OF AUNT JANE'S JALAP WHICH IS NOT STUFF MY DEAR MISSUS CHALMERS BUT A MOST INVALUABLE MEDICINE HUGHES BROUGHT IT THIS AFTERNOON AS A SAMPLE
GIVE YOU WHAT YOU MIGHT GIVE ME A TESTIMONIAL THE GOVERNOR LOOKED AT THE PRISONER THEN AT HIS FRIENDS A TESTIMONIAL MIGHT WE INDEED WHAT SORT OF TESTIMONIAL DO YOU ALLUDE TO
WHEN THE GOVERNOR CEASED THE PRISONER SEEMED TO BE CONSIDERING WHAT ANSWER HE SHOULD MAKE THEN INCLINING HIS HEAD WITH THAT ALMOST SATURNINE GRACE IF ONE MAY COIN A PHRASE
MISTER BENYON HAD BUOYED US UP BY HIS STATEMENT THAT HE WOULD SOON HAVE TO GO HIS IDEAS OF SOON WERE DIFFERENT FROM OURS I SUPPOSE AT THE OUTSIDE OUR INNINGS HAD LASTED HALF AN HOUR HOW LONG WE BOWLED TO MISTER BENYON IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY
SALE AT A MODERATE ESTIMATE ONE MILLION BOTTLES A YEAR
THEY'RE SUCH A THIRSTY LOT POSSIBLY I SUGGESTED THAT IS IN A MEASURE OWING TO THE NATURE OF THEIR OCCUPATION THAT MAY BE BUT STILL THERE IS A LIMIT AND WHEN A MAN IS ALWAYS DRINKING I THINK IT'S TIME FOR HIM TO STOP
THE CHAPLAIN WHO WAS CARESSING THE HAND WHICH HAD BEEN SCORCHED BY THE FLAMES BURST OUT WITH WHAT WAS FOR HIM A PASSIONATE APPEAL
THEY WERE THE KEENEST MEN OF BUSINESS TOO AND TALK OF THE RIGOUR OF A COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION THEY FORMED THEMSELVES INTO AN EXAMINING BOARD WHICH VERY SOON TOOK THE STIFFENING OUT OF ME
WELL HE SAID IT'S A PITY IT SHOULD BE WASTED I'LL EAT IT MYSELF WHICH HE DID AND ME STANDING IN THE RAIN THERE LOOKING ON THAT DID PUT MY BACK UP MISTER EVANS I SAID SHORT AND SHARP I WISH YOU A GOOD DAY I AM GOING
THERE IS MY BROTHER NOW MATILDA
THIS WAS HARD COMING FROM MARGARET MY DEAR MARGARET THE NAME IS HALF THE BATTLE HUGHES THINKS IT'S A SPLENDID ONE BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT MAKES ONE THINK OF INDIGESTION THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S MEANT TO DO BEFORE OR AFTERWARDS
I BELIEVE IT IS CALLED BY THE INHABITANTS A TOWN IT IS A PRETTY PLACE AND NOT UNKNOWN IN THE LOCALITY IT HAS A SEASON AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING AND IT WAS DURING THE SEASON I WAS THERE
WASHING A CARRIAGE WITH A BUCKET OF WATER
THE END WILL NOT BE LONG THE PRISONER SEEMED LOST IN REFLECTION THE OFFICIALS SEEMED LOST IN REFLECTION TOO BUT THEIR REFLECTIONS WERE PROBABLY OF A DIFFERENT KIND
I WAS RAPIDLY APPROACHING THE CONDITION IN WHICH ALICE MUST HAVE BEEN IN WONDERLAND PREPARED FOR ANYTHING TIME WENT ON MISTER SAPSWORTH AND I BOWLED OVER AFTER OVER MISTER BENYON WAS MAKING A RECORD IN TALL SCORING
HE PUT HIS HAND INTO HIS TROUSERS POCKET THOSE REMARKABLE GARMENTS FITTED HIM LIKE EEL SKINS
BUT OF COURSE WE SHOULD BOTH OF US SEE THAT SHE MADE A GOOD THING OF IT WHEN THE SALE GOT UP I NEED SCARCELY OBSERVE WHAT FORTUNES HAVE BEEN MADE IN PATENT MEDICINES AND LOST IN THEM MY BOY
ORIGINALLY THERE HAD BEEN QUITE A CROWD ASSEMBLED IN COURSE OF TIME THIS HAD DWINDLED TO HALF A DOZEN STRAGGLERS A LITTLE LATER ON EVEN THESE HAD GONE
THAT THAT FELLOW'S PINNED ME TO MY CHAIR HE GASPED HE APPEARED TO BE MAKING FUTILE EFFORTS TO RISE FROM HIS SEAT YOU CANNOT RETURN TO TOWN DISMISS THE IDEA FROM YOUR MIND
IN FACT IN A RANGE OF SUBJECTS WHICH I WILL NOT EVEN VENTURE TO ENUMERATE THEY REFUSED ME ONE SOLITARY PASS THEY PLUCKED ME IN THEM ALL IT DID NOT ADD TO MY SENSE OF SATISFACTION
THAT WOULD MAKE FOUR WITH ME BUT I DIDN'T CORRECT HER AND THEN YOU AND I COULD LOOK OVER THE HOUSE TOGETHER AFTER DINNER SO I ASKED THEM AND THEY CAME
THE MAJOR ONLY GROANED HE TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HIS BROW THE GOVERNOR LOOKED UP FROM THE PAPER KNIFE WITH WHICH HE WAS AGAIN TRIFLING
THE MAN WHO TAKES MUCH OF THAT STUFF WILL BE KILLED IF HE ISN'T CURED DEATH FOR ME RATHER THAN AUNT JANE'S JALAP' IF IT IS JALAP IT IS RATHER PUNGENT I OWNED
AH IT IS TO THE AFTER EFFECTS WE MUST LOOK FORWARD IT IS THE AFTER EFFECTS I'M THINKING OF SAID PYBUS THAT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN I COULD BEAR IT WAS THE AFTER EFFECTS I WAS THINKING OF AS WELL COME LET'S ADJOURN AND HAVE A LITTLE MUSIC
I FELT THAT IT WAS TIME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF IT'S A FINE EVENING SHE TURNED SHE LOOKED ME UP AND DOWN THEN SHE LOOKED STRAIGHT IN FRONT OF HER AGAIN I DON'T KNOW YOU BUT I WAS NOT TO BE CRUSHED
YOU MUST KNOW THAT WILLYUM IS THAT NEAR ABOUT MONEY THAT I NEVER SAW NOTHING LIKE HIM NOT THAT IT'S A BAD THING IN A MAN THOUGH IT MAY BE CARRIED TOO FAR AND I MUST SAY I DO THINK WILLYUM DO CARRY IT TOO FAR
AND FAVORABLY LOCATED BUILDING SITES ILLUSTRATE THE SAME PRINCIPLE IN SOME CASES IT IS TRUE THE DEMAND MAY BE DUE TO SOME TEMPORARY CAUSE
AFFECT AND LIMIT THE DEMAND AND THUS INCREASE THE SUPPLY MEN CANNOT IT IS TRUE INCREASE THE STORES OF COPPER IN THE EARTH BUT THEY DEVISE NEW PROCESSES TO EXTRACT IT FROM ORES BEFORE WORTHLESS AND INVENT METHODS OF PROCURING ALUMINIUM
A GROUP OF COMPLEMENTARY DEEDS THERE CAN BE NO HARMONY WITHOUT A CENTRAL SIMPLE GUIDING PRINCIPLE THE WISE AND MORAL USE OF GOODS AND THE ECONOMIC USE OF THEM ARE THEREFORE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ESSENTIALLY THE SAME LIFE
AND THUS IS BROUGHT ABOUT AN INCREASE OF THE STOCK OF WEALTH IN SOME CASES HOWEVER IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS THE DREDGING OF HARBORS OR AS THE PROTECTING OF FORESTS ARE MADE BY MEN COLLECTIVELY THROUGH THE AGENCY OF GOVERNMENTS
THIS SUBJECT ALREADY TOUCHED UPON IN THE SECTIONS ON THE EFFICIENCY OF LABOR DESERVES FURTHER NOTICE FROM YOUTH TO AGE THE FOOLISH CHOICE OF GOODS YIELDS ITS HARVEST OF ULTIMATE MISERY WHEN BABIES ARE FED ON CRACKERS DIPPED IN COFFEE
IT IS A SUGGESTIVE FACT THAT CIVILIZED MAN EQUIPPED WITH ALL OF THE INVENTIONS AND THE ADVANTAGES OF SCIENCE SPENDS MORE HOURS OF EFFORT IN GAINING A LIVELIHOOD THAN DOES THE SAVAGE WITH HIS ALMOST UNAIDED HANDS
EXCEPT AT RARE POINTS WHEN THE PAIN OF WORK
SO WEAK AS COMPARED WITH MANY KINDS OF ANIMALS ARE ABLE TO RESIST THE ENEMIES WHICH BESET THEM HE NEEDS CLOTHING TO PROTECT HIM AGAINST THE HARSHER CLIMATES OF THE LANDS TO WHICH HE MOVES
IT IS THE ESSENTIALLY ECONOMIC FORM AS CONTRASTED WITH THE LEGAL AND PERSONAL FORMS JUST DESCRIBED BECAUSE IT IS IMPERSONAL AND REDUCIBLE TO A RULE OF VALUE DISTRIBUTION UNDER COMPETITION IS MADE NOT WITH REFERENCE
SOMEWHERE HOWEVER THE DESIRE FOR THESE CHANGES MUST ARISE IN THE MINDS OF INDIVIDUALS INCREASE OF MOST THINGS INVOLVES COST OR SACRIFICE IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SENSE
THAT IT SEEMS ALMOST SELF EVIDENT THE MOTIVE FORCE IN ECONOMICS IS FOUND IN THE FEELINGS OF MEN
WHICH CAPTURE THE NATURAL FORCES OF THE WORLD PUT THEM INTO THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND MAKE THEM DO THE RIGHT THING OR WHICH GROUP AND RELATE THE MATERIALS OF THE WORLD IN THE RIGHT WAYS
THE FUNCTION OF PASSING UPON THE ECONOMIC MERITS OR DESIRES OF ALL OTHERS YET THAT ALONE IS NOT A CONCLUSIVE ARGUMENT AGAINST ALL USE OF AUTHORITATIVE DISTRIBUTION IN MANY PRACTICAL CASES
ONE ECONOMIC RENT LIKEWISE CALLED NATURAL COMPETITIVE AND SOMETIMES RACK RENT IS TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM CONTRACT RENT ECONOMIC RENT IS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE USUFRUCT
ACTIVITY IS DEPENDENT NOT ON BARE PHYSICAL NECESSITY BUT ON DEVELOPED WANTS IN THE ECONOMIC SENSE OF THE TERM SUCH SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS PROPERTY AND INHERITANCE OWE THEIR ORIGIN AND THEIR JUSTIFICATION
WILLINGLY TO THE SUPERIOR POWER AND TAKES WHAT THAT POWER ACCORDS HIM THERE ARE FEW DESPOTISMS IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT BASED ON THE WISHES AND AVERAGE CAPACITIES OF THE GOVERNED IF THE CITIZENS AS A BODY REALLY DESIRED AND WERE DESERVING OF BETTER GOVERNMENT

WHEREAS IN A SMALL FACTORY MUCH TIME AND ENERGY ARE WASTED IN ADJUSTING ONE MACHINE FOR VARIOUS PROCESSES THE MACHINERY IN A LARGE FACTORY IS THUS MORE FULLY UTILIZED
THIS WAS PUT IN CONTRAST WITH INTEREST FOR MONEY AND CAPITAL AND WITH WAGES OF LABOR THIS MEANING IS NOW BEING ABANDONED BY ECONOMIC STUDENTS A WIDER MEANING RECENTLY GIVEN TO THE WORD BY MANY ECONOMISTS
BUT THE ECONOMIC SUPPLY IS SIGNIFICANT THERE IS DANGER OF CONFUSION BETWEEN THESE TWO IDEAS
WHILE THE MINES OF USEFUL METALS WERE TOUCHED BUT LIGHTLY WITHIN THE LAST CENTURY THE EARTH'S CRUST HAS BEEN EXPLOITED WITH STARTLING RAPIDITY SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND MECHANICAL IMPROVEMENT HAVE COMBINED
A GREAT TECHNICAL ADVANTAGE OF LARGE PRODUCTION IS THE BETTER AND FULLER USE OF MACHINERY A LARGE FACTORY WITH A LARGE OUTPUT CAN KEEP A SPECIAL MACHINE ADJUSTED FOR EACH PATTERN AND PROCESS
BUYING AT A BETTER TIME AND JUDGING BETTER THAN HIS COMPETITORS THE QUALITY OF GOODS IF IN A GIVEN MARKET AT A GIVEN TIME GOODS ARE SOLD TO ONE MORE CHEAPLY THAN TO OTHERS IT IS AN ACT OF GENEROSITY

ARE THE LADIES STILL AS FOND OF RUNNING ABOUT IN MY TIME THEY USED TO GO ON THE SAME DAY TO THE PROMENADE TO THE ASSEMBLY TO THE THEATER TO THE BALL BUT HOW LONG YOUR NOSE IS I CANNOT GROW USED TO IT IN TRUTH MADAM ANSWERED DESIRE
BUT SHE DETERMINED TO BEAR IT GLADLY IF SHE COULD ONLY RELEASE HER DEAR BROTHERS SO SHE BRUISED THE NETTLES WITH HER BARE FEET AND SPUN THE FLAX AT SUNSET HER BROTHERS RETURNED
OF THE KINGDOMS HOWEVER DESIRE THOUGHT NOT AT ALL HE WAS SO MUCH STRUCK WITH HER BEAUTY THE PRINCESS MIGNONETTA ALTHOUGH HE WAS THUS CHARMED WITH HER HAD A LITTLE TURNED UP NOSE WHICH HARMONIZED ADMIRABLY WITH HER OTHER FEATURES
WERE AS TALL AS ANYBODY ABOUT THE COURT BUT IN RATHER POOR CIRCUMSTANCES ON HEARING THIS THE KING CARRIED TOM TO HIS TREASURY THE PLACE WHERE HE KEPT ALL HIS MONEY AND TOLD HIM TO TAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS HE COULD CARRY HOME TO HIS PARENTS
FIRST SHE TRIED THE COUNTRY AND WENT FROM PARISH TO PARISH BUT IT WAS POOR WORK AND SO SHE CAME INTO THE TOWN THERE SHE WENT ABOUT FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE FOR A WHILE
SO SWEET A SONG HE HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET RUBBED HIS EYES
THE FROG ROLLED HER EYES FOR A MINUTE AND THEN TURNING TO ONE OF THE LITTLE ONES AT HER SIDE SAID
WHY HE'S AS ROUND AS A SAUSAGE AND AS LAZY AS A SNAIL OH IF YOU MUST KNOW SAID THE LAD I GAVE HIM THE BONES GOOD BOY SAID THE CAPTAIN TO THINK OF THE DOG SO HE SPREAD OUT THE CLOTH
THE OLD MAN SAID TO THE MAIDEN HERE IS ABUNDANCE AND TO SPARE GO NOW INTO THE KITCHEN AND COOK SOME SUPPER FOR US THE GIRL FOUND PLENTY OF EVERYTHING IN THE KITCHEN AND COOKED A GOOD MEAL
AND THOUGHT OF HER ELEVEN BROTHERS WHO WERE ALL AWAY SORROWFULLY SHE STOLE AWAY FROM THE PALACE AND WALKED THE WHOLE DAY OVER FIELDS AND MOORS TILL SHE CAME TO THE GREAT FOREST
HE DETERMINED TO CONVINCE HIMSELF
HIS FIRST CARE WAS FOR HIS HORSE STABLE THERE WAS NONE BUT THERE WAS A BIT OF A SHED FOR THE OLD PEOPLE'S COW
HE OR SHE WAS ALWAYS SPOKEN OF AS HAVING A LONG NOSE THE ROOM WAS HUNG ROUND WITH PICTURES IN WHICH ALL THE FIGURES HAD LARGE NOSES AND DESIRE GREW SO ACCUSTOMED TO REGARD LENGTH OF NOSE AS AN ORNAMENT THAT HE WOULD NOT FOR AN EMPIRE HAVE PARTED WITH AN ATOM OF HIS
AND THEY FOLLOWED HIM TILL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT AND NOT ONLY DID THEY FOLLOW HIM THUS FAR BUT LONG AFTER HE HAD LEFT BOTH HOUSE AND WOOD FAR BEHIND THOSE BEAUTIFUL EYES STILL HAUNTED HIM
THANK YOU THANK YOU KINDLY BUT NOW EVERYTHING IS READY FOR THE WEDDING AND WE SHALL SET OFF TO CHURCH AT ONCE SOMETHING DREADFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN THOUGHT THE LAD BUT HE SAID NOTHING OUT LOUD
I WAS SAYING THEN THAT I WAS YOUR FATHER'S FRIEND AT THAT TIME HE FREQUENTLY CAME TO SEE ME AND YOU MUST KNOW THAT IN THOSE DAYS I WAS VERY PRETTY YOUR FATHER TOLD ME SO I MUST REPEAT TO YOU A CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD TOGETHER THE LAST TIME HE SAW ME
BUT THE BOOK THAT HE COULD NOT GET TRIED JUST THEN THEN THEY SAILED WELL AND FAR TILL A STORM OVERTOOK THEM WHICH LASTED MANY DAYS SO THEY LAY TO AND DROVE TILL
AND LITTLE IMAGINED THAT THOSE WHO HAD PRAISED HIS NOSE HAD RIDICULED IT IN THEIR HEARTS AS THE WAITING WOMAN WAS RIDICULING THE FAIRY FOR THE PRINCE OBSERVED THAT SHE TURNED HER HEAD ASIDE EVERY NOW AND THEN TO LAUGH WITH REGARD TO HIMSELF
DARK CLOUDS CAME NEARER
BUT THEN THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM THAT THEY WERE BADLY OFF FOR FOOD THOUGH THE KING WISHED TO SEND THEM AWAY FULL BOTH OF MEAT AND DRINK SO THE LAD HAD TO BRING OUT HIS TABLECLOTH AND THEN THERE WAS NOT A MAN THAT LACKED ANYTHING
HIGH UP IN THE CLOUDS AND OVER THE WIDE WORLD THEY FLEW TILL THEY CAME TO A THICK DARK WOOD WHICH STRETCHED FAR AWAY TO THE SEASHORE
THAT WAS WHAT SHE SAID HER HUSBAND DID HIS BEST TO STOP HER TONGUE NO ONE KNEW HE SAID HOW CHILDREN WOULD TURN OUT IN LIFE OR WHAT MIGHT BEFALL HIS OWN THE BOY WAS A CLEVER HANDY LAD
HERE HAVE I STOOD AND CALLED AND BAWLED FOR A HUNDRED YEARS AND NO ONE HAS HEEDED ME BUT YOU COME ON TO MY THIRD SISTER AND YOU SHALL HAVE BETTER PAY STILL SO HE WENT WITH HER
THAT THEY MIGHT WITNESS HER MARRIAGE BUT WHERE ARE MY TWO SISTERS SHE ASKED
AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE HAD GOT READY A GOOD SUPPER AT THE OLD MAN'S REQUEST AND HAD PLACED THE DISHES ON THE TABLE SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF I MUST NOT APPEASE MY HUNGER TILL I HAVE FED THESE GOOD CREATURES
WHERE THEIR SISTER ELIZA LAY ASLEEP IN HER ROOM THEY HOVERED OVER THE ROOF TWISTED THEIR LONG NECKS AND FLAPPED THEIR WINGS BUT NO ONE HEARD THEM OR SAW THEM SO THEY WERE AT LAST OBLIGED TO FLY AWAY
HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS
I PREFER BELIEVING WHAT I HAVE HEARD WITH MY OWN EARS AND YOU MAY AS WELL TELL ME THE PLAIN TRUTH FOR I AM DETERMINED TO LEARN IT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER SO THEN THE OLD MAN MADE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT
POOR LITTLE TOM'S LEGS THIGHS AND BODY WERE SADLY BRUISED HE ROARED LOUD WITH PAIN AND BEGGED TO BE LET OUT PROMISING NEVER TO STEAL AGAIN A SHORT TIME AFTERWARDS HIS MOTHER WAS MAKING A BATTER PUDDING AND TOM
SHE CAN MARRY THAT PERSON ONLY WHO CAN SUCCEED IN TREADING ON HER CAT'S TAIL THE KING SAID TO HIMSELF THAT WILL NOT BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH AND HE QUITTED THE FAIRY DETERMINED RATHER TO CRUSH THE CAT'S TAIL THAN TO FAIL IN TREADING ON IT
VERY FINE THAT WILL BE I DARE SAY THOUGHT THE LAD IF I WERE ONLY WELL ABOVE GROUND I'D RUN AWAY FROM THE WHOLE PACK OF YOU THAT WAS WHAT HE THOUGHT BUT HE SAID NOTHING OUT LOUD SO HE FOLLOWED THEM AS WELL AS HE COULD
HE WENT TO CONSULT A FAIRY TO ASCERTAIN WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO TO MAKE THE PRINCESS LOVE HIM THE FAIRY SAID TO HIM YOU KNOW THAT THE PRINCESS HAS A LARGE CAT OF WHICH SHE IS VERY FOND WELL
THAT YOU NEVER ASKED OUT OF YOUR OWN WITS SAID THE OLD WITCH BUT FOR ALL THAT HE GOT THE SWORD THEN THE OLD HAG SAID AGAIN COME ON WITH ME TO MY THIRD SISTER
VERY SOON THE JOYOUS CHURCH BELLS ANNOUNCED THE MARRIAGE FEAST AND THAT THE BEAUTIFUL DUMB GIRL OUT OF THE WOOD WAS TO BE MADE QUEEN OF THE COUNTRY THEN THE ARCHBISHOP WHISPERED WICKED WORDS IN THE KING'S EAR
I SHALL NOT BE READY TO COME HOME AND THAT SHE MAY NOT LOSE HER WAY I WILL TAKE WITH ME A BAG OF SEEDS AND STREW THEM ON MY PATH SO WHEN THE SUN WAS RISEN TO THE CENTER OF THE HEAVENS THE MAIDEN SET OUT ON HER WAY CARRYING A JUG OF SOUP
WHEN HE BECAME OLD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND IT
A COCK AND A BRINDLED COW AND THE ENCHANTMENT WAS NOT TO END UNTIL A MAIDEN SHOULD COME SO KIND HEARTED THAT SHE SHOULD BEHAVE AS WELL TO MY ANIMALS AS SHE DID TO ME AND SUCH A ONE YOU HAVE BEEN
PEOPLE MUST DWELL THERE SHE THOUGHT WHO WILL KEEP ME DURING THE NIGHT AND SHE WALKED TOWARD THE LIGHT IN A SHORT TIME SHE CAME TO A COTTAGE WHERE THE WINDOWS WERE ALL LIGHTED UP AND WHEN SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR A HOARSE VOICE CALLED FROM WITHIN
SO SHE MADE HIM SMART AND FITTED HIM OUT AS WELL AS SHE COULD AND HE TOOK OUT HIS NEW SHOES AND BRUSHED THEM TILL THEY WERE AS BRIGHT AS GLASS AND WHEN HE HAD DONE THAT OFF HE WENT BUT ALL HAPPENED JUST AS IT DID BEFORE
MOTHER MOTHER WHERE ARE YOU TOMMY MY DEAR TOMMY SAID HIS MOTHER HERE MOTHER REPLIED HE IN THE RED COW'S MOUTH HIS MOTHER BEGAN TO CRY AND WRING HER HANDS BUT THE COW SURPRISED AT THE ODD NOISE IN HER THROAT
NOW WHEN THE BOY WAS AGAIN ALONE WITH THE DOG HE WANTED TO TRY THE SWORD SO HE SMOTE AT THE DOG WITH THE BLACK EDGE AND IT FELL DEAD ON THE DECK
BUT DUMMLING'S FEATHER DID AS IT DID THE FIRST TIME AND FELL TO EARTH JUST BY THE TRAPDOOR SO HE PULLED IT UP ONCE AGAIN AND WENT DOWN THE STEPS WHEN THE DOOR WAS OPENED HE TOLD THE BIG FROG THAT HE WANTED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL RING IN THE WORLD
THE CHARCOAL BURNERS SING THE OLD SONGS TO WHICH WE HAVE DANCED AS CHILDREN THIS IS OUR FATHERLAND TO WHICH WE ARE DRAWN BY LOVING TIES AND HERE WE HAVE FOUND YOU OUR DEAR LITTLE SISTER
SHE NOTICED HOW THE COUNTLESS PEBBLES ON THE SEASHORE HAD BEEN SMOOTHED AND ROUNDED BY THE ACTION OF THE WATER GLASS IRON STONES EVERYTHING THAT LAY THERE MINGLED TOGETHER
THE GIRL THEN LAY DOWN IN THE OTHER BED FIRST SAYING HER PRAYERS BEFORE SHE WENT TO SLEEP SHE SLEPT QUIETLY TILL MIDNIGHT AND AT THAT HOUR THERE BEGAN SUCH A TUMULT IN THE HOUSE THAT IT AWAKENED HER
POOR LITTLE ELIZA WAS ALONE IN HER ROOM PLAYING WITH A GREEN LEAF FOR SHE HAD NO OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND SHE PIERCED A HOLE THROUGH THE LEAF AND LOOKED THROUGH IT AT THE SUN
WHICH WE HAVE TO CROSS FOR A LONG DISTANCE THERE IS NO ISLAND IN OUR PASSAGE UPON WHICH WE COULD PASS THE NIGHT NOTHING BUT A LITTLE ROCK RISING OUT OF THE SEA UPON WHICH WE CAN SCARCELY STAND WITH SAFETY
THE BED WAS OF IVORY AND THE CURTAINS OF RED VELVET
SOON AFTER THAT ALL WAS QUIET BUT THE MAIDEN TOOK NO HARM AND WENT QUIETLY OFF AGAIN TO SLEEP WHEN HOWEVER THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING SUN AWOKE HER WHAT A SIGHT MET HER EYES
YOU SHALL WAIT NO LONGER SAID SHE TO DESIRE CALLING HER DOMESTICS YOU ARE VERY POLITE AND IN SPITE OF THE SIZE OF YOUR NOSE YOU ARE VERY AMIABLE
TIRED BEAST THEN HE WENT INTO THE COTTAGE WHICH CONSISTED OF ONE LITTLE ROOM WHICH WAS BOTH DARK AND LOW HE SAT DOWN ON A WOODEN BENCH AND BEGAN TO TALK TO THE OLD PEOPLE
AND WHO NOW WERE BOWING AND SCRAPING BEFORE HIM HE COULD NOT HELP GIVING A SIDE GLANCE TO WHERE SHE STOOD GAZING AT HIM WITH LOVELY
BUT HE WAS GLAD ENOUGH FOR HERE AT LEAST HE SHOULD FIND SOMEBODY
OLD AND FEEBLE AS THEY WERE SHE EARNED A FEW PENCE BY HER SPINNING AND WEAVING
ON TO A TUFT THAT HE MIGHT NOT DIRTY HIS BRIGHT SHOES PLUMP IT WENT AND IT GAVE WAY WITH HIM AND THERE WAS NO STOPPING TILL HE WAS DOWN IN THE SAME NASTY DEEP DARK HOLE AGAIN AT FIRST HE WAS GLAD
WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY TO THAT THEY ANSWERED AGAIN CLUCK AND EVERYTHING THEREUPON OCCURRED THE SAME AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY THE GIRL COOKED A GOOD MEAL ATE AND DRANK WITH THE OLD MAN
A SMILE PLAYED AROUND HER MOUTH AND THE CRIMSON BLOOD RUSHED TO HER CHEEKS SHE THOUGHT OF HER BROTHERS AND THEIR RELEASE MADE HER SO JOYFUL THAT SHE KISSED THE KING'S HAND THEN HE PRESSED HER TO HIS HEART
FOR HE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT WHEN HE HAD BEEN THERE A WHILE HE HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE UGLY RAT AND LOATH HE WAS TO SEE HER WITH THE BUNCH OF KEYS AT THE END OF HER TAIL GOOD DAY MY BOY SAID THE RAT YOU ARE HEARTILY WELCOME AGAIN
SO SHE PUT THE TOADS INTO CLEAR WATER AND THEY TURNED GREEN IMMEDIATELY SHE NEXT CALLED ELIZA AND HELPED HER TO UNDRESS AND GET INTO THE BATH AS ELIZA DIPPED HER HEAD UNDER THE WATER
PATTED IT ABOUT TILL THE WIRES BROKE AND SET THOMAS AT LIBERTY THE KING RECEIVED TOM AGAIN INTO FAVOR WHICH HE DID NOT LIVE TO ENJOY FOR A LARGE SPIDER ONE DAY ATTACKED HIM AND ALTHOUGH HE DREW HIS SWORD AND FOUGHT WELL
A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS WITH SHINING MASSES OF ICE ON THEIR SUMMITS IN THE CENTER ROSE A CASTLE APPARENTLY A MILE LONG WITH ROWS OF COLUMNS RISING ONE ABOVE ANOTHER
AND NOW HE FELT BOUND TO PERFORM THE VOW THAT HE HAD MADE WHICH WAS JUST WHAT HE MOST WISHED TO DO SO HE RODE FORTH WITH ALL HIS ROYAL TRAIN
THEY WERE NOW SO HIGH THAT A LARGE SHIP BENEATH THEM LOOKED LIKE A WHITE SEA GULL SKIMMING THE WAVES
I AM VERY TIRED WHERE IS MY BED WHERE I SHALL LIE DOWN AND SLEEP THE ANIMALS REPLIED
WHETHER THEY WERE DEWDROPS OR TEARS NO ONE COULD SAY LONELY AS IT WAS ON THE SEASHORE SHE DID NOT OBSERVE IT FOR THE EVER MOVING SEA SHOWED MORE CHANGES IN A FEW HOURS
AND FLAPPED THEIR GREAT WHITE WINGS AS SOON AS THE SUN HAD DISAPPEARED UNDER THE WATER THE FEATHERS OF THE SWANS FELL OFF AND ELEVEN BEAUTIFUL PRINCES
WHILE SHE WAS LOOKING AT HIM AND SAW THAT HE WAS BOTH YOUNG AND HANDSOME HE AWOKE AND STARTING UP SAID TO THE MAIDEN
AS I AM AND THAT OF COURSE SHE CANNOT BE HE MARKED WELL WHERE THE LITTLE COTTAGE STOOD AND SOON HE REACHED A ROAD HE KNEW WELL FOR THE WILD WOOD LAY ON THE VERY BORDER OF HIS OWN LAND
THE BATTER FILLED TOM'S MOUTH AND PREVENTED HIM FROM CRYING BUT ON FEELING THE HOT WATER HE KICKED AND STRUGGLED SO MUCH IN THE POT THAT HIS MOTHER THOUGHT THAT THE PUDDING WAS BEWITCHED AND PULLING IT OUT OF THE POT SHE THREW IT OUTSIDE THE DOOR A
WELL LEARNED IN THE TAILORING TRADE HIS CLOTHING WAS SUPPLIED A NEEDLE DANGLED BY HIS SIDE A DAPPER MOUSE HE USED TO RIDE THUS STRUTTED TOM IN STATELY PRIDE IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY DIVERTING TO SEE TOM IN THIS DRESS
NOW THE ROAD IS GOOD COME MY DEAR AND GET UP INTO THE CARRIAGE THE LAD TURNED ROUND IN A TRICE AND HAD NEAR LOST BOTH NOSE AND EARS THERE STOOD THE GRANDEST CARRIAGE WITH SIX WHITE HORSES TO IT
BUT HE COULD NOT HELP NOTICING THAT THOUGH EVERYTHING WAS NEAT AND COMFORTABLE IN THE COTTAGE THEY BOTH SEEMED TO BE VERY UNHAPPY HE THEREFORE ASKED THEM WHY THEY WERE SO MELANCHOLY AND LEARNED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE BECAUSE THEY HAD NO CHILDREN THE POOR WOMAN SAID
AT LENGTH WHEN IT BECAME QUITE DARK SHE ALSO PERCEIVED THE LIGHTED COTTAGE AND ENTERING IT BEGGED VERY POLITELY TO BE ALLOWED TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE
AND PUT HER ON THE CARROT AND LO AND BEHOLD NO SOONER WAS SHE SEATED THAN SHE CHANGED INTO A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN AND THE CARROT AND THE MICE INTO A GRAND CHARIOT DRAWN BY SIX PRANCING HORSES
AND THERE HE TOOK HIS SEAT BETWEEN THE LADY MAYORESS AND HER DAUGHTER SO AS THEY SAT THERE IN THE GREATEST STATE AND ATE AND DRANK AND WERE MERRY HE THREW THE HALF OF THE RING INTO THE DAUGHTER'S GLASS AND NO ONE SAW IT BUT SHE WAS
ONE OF THE TOADS SAT ON HER HAIR A SECOND ON HER FOREHEAD AND A THIRD ON HER BREAST BUT SHE DID NOT SEEM TO NOTICE THEM AND WHEN SHE ROSE OUT OF THE WATER
COME IN THE GIRL OPENED THE DOOR AND PERCEIVED A HOARY OLD MAN SITTING AT A TABLE WITH HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS AND HIS WHITE BEARD FLOWING DOWN OVER THE TABLE ON TO THE GROUND
IN A VERY FEW MINUTES ALL THE HUNTSMEN STOOD BEFORE THE CAVE AND THE HANDSOMEST OF THEM WAS THE KING OF THE COUNTRY HE ADVANCED TOWARD HER FOR HE HAD NEVER SEEN A MORE BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN
AND THE OLD PEOPLE PERSISTED
SHE BELIEVED THEY WERE FALLING BUT THEY AGAIN SOARED ONWARD PRESENTLY SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE ROCK JUST BELOW THEM AND BY THIS TIME THE SUN WAS HALF HIDDEN BY THE WAVES
AND BLEW THREE FEATHERS UP INTO THE AIR SAYING AS THEY FLY THITHER SHALL YOU FOLLOW ONE FEATHER FLEW EAST ANOTHER WEST AND THE THIRD WENT IN A STRAIGHT LINE BETWEEN THE TWO FOR A LITTLE WAY AND THEN FELL SUDDENLY TO THE GROUND
THEN HE AWOKE AND STIFF ENOUGH HE WAS IN ALL HIS LIMBS FROM LYING ON SO HARD A BED
AND SHE COULD SIT UP IN BED
HE TURNED ROUND AND THERE LAY MANY MANY HUNDRED ELLS OF THE WHITEST LINEN SO FINE THAT THE HANDIEST WEAVING GIRL COULD NOT HAVE WOVEN IT FINER MOTHER MOTHER COME OUT HE CRIED AND ROARED OUT CAME THE GOODY IN A BUSTLE
WERE THE BEAUTIFUL EVER CHANGING CLOUD PALACES OF THE FATA MORGANA INTO WHICH NO MORTAL CAN ENTER ELIZA WAS STILL GAZING AT THE SCENE WHEN MOUNTAINS FORESTS AND CASTLES MELTED AWAY
SO NOW THE PRINCE WAS AT HOME ONCE MORE SURROUNDED BY ALL THE GOOD THINGS IMAGINABLE AND YET HE KNEW NOT ONE MOMENT'S CONTENT
OR WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE REACHED OUR BELOVED FATHERLAND FOR OUR FLIGHT ACROSS THE SEA OCCUPIES TWO OF THE LONGEST DAYS IN THE YEAR WE HAVE PERMISSION TO VISIT OUR HOME ONCE IN EVERY YEAR AND TO REMAIN ELEVEN DAYS
MEANWHILE THE THIRD MORNING ARRIVED AND THE WOODCUTTER TOLD HIS WIFE TO SEND THEIR YOUNGEST CHILD WITH HIS DINNER FOR SAID HE SHE IS ALWAYS OBEDIENT AND GOOD
WHEN SHE SAW ALL THAT LOVELY CLOTH
THAT FROM THE MOMENT YOU COMMENCE YOUR TASK UNTIL IT IS FINISHED EVEN SHOULD IT OCCUPY YEARS OF YOUR LIFE YOU MUST NOT SPEAK THE FIRST WORD YOU UTTER
WE CANNOT SAY I AM NOT WILLING TO LEND YOU THIS WORK BUT IF THE BORROWER IS A SUSPICIOUS PERSON WE CAN SAY WE HAVE OCCASION TO USE IT THAT WE REGRET IT VERY MUCH BUT THAT WE WILL LEND IT TO HIM IN A FEW DAYS
TOO LIGHT CONVERSATION DANCING AND LOVE SONGS WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE IN HIS PRESENCE ECCLESIASTICS HAVE TWO SHOALS TO AVOID THEIR CUSTOM OF PREACHING A SEVERE AND SACRED MORALITY AND OF CATECHISING OR CENSURING WITH AUTHORITY THE PENITENT
IF WE HAVE ANYTHING URGENT TO SAY TO THEM WE MAY ASK PERMISSION TO ACCOMPANY THEM WE WILL ADD THAT AT PARIS A YOUNG MAN OUGHT TO AVOID APPROACHING AND EVEN SALUTING A YOUNG LADY OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE OUT OF REGARD TO THE NATURAL TIMIDITY OF HER SEX
IF YOU SPEND A CONSIDERABLE TIME IN THE SELECTION OF ARTICLES APOLOGIZE TO THE SHOPKEEPER WHO WAITS FOR YOU TO DECIDE IF THE PRICE SEEMS TO YOU TOO HIGH AND THAT THE SHOP HAS NOT FIXED PRICES
LET HIM THEN RESERVE ONLY FOR HIS FRIENDS FOR TRUE FRIENDS OF THE ARTS HIS NOBLE AND STRIKING BURSTS OF INSPIRATION PEOPLE ARE ALSO GENERALLY PRONE TO SUSPECT ARTISTS OF JEALOUSY IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THIS ACCUSATION
DOUBTFUL WHETHER TO FAVOR YOUR ADVERSARY OR YOURSELF POLITENESS IS NOT LESS OPPOSED TO MAKING EXCESSIVE COMPLAINTS TO THE FIRST PERSON YOU MEET THAN TO THE FREQUENT AND EXTRAVAGANT EULOGIUMS WHICH YOU

PART TWO OF PROPRIETY OF DEPORTMENT IN REGARD TO OUR SOCIAL RELATIONS CHAPTER ONE OF DEPORTMENT IN THE STREET SOME READERS WILL PERHAPS BE SURPRISED TO SEE ME COMMENCE A CHAPTER WITH THE DUTY WE OWE TO PERSONS PASSING THE STREET
THEY ALSO AS THEY PASS OUGHT TO BOW POLITELY TO YOU IF STORMY WEATHER HAS MADE IT NECESSARY TO LAY A PLANK ACROSS THE GUTTERS WHICH HAVE BECOME SUDDENLY FULL OF WATER IT IS NOT PROPER TO CROWD BEFORE ANOTHER IN ORDER TO PASS OVER THE FRAIL BRIDGE
IT WILL BE ENOUGH TO MENTION SUCH IMPERTINENCE IN ORDER TO DESPISE IT AS WE OUGHT AS TO THOSE YOUNG MEN WHO ENTERTAIN A FALSE IDEA THAT PARISIAN LADIES ARE COQUETTES OR FORWARD IN THEIR MANNERS AND BESIDES THAT EVERYTHING IS ALLOWABLE IN A LARGE CITY
YOU ARE LIABLE TO MEET THOSE WHO AS WELL AS YOURSELF ARE STRANGERS TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR TO HINDER THOSE WHO ARE BUSY
WHEN ANY ONE WHO IS VISITING YOU HAS NEED OF A SHAWL A HANDKERCHIEF A HAT OFFER IT WITH A COMPLAISANT ZEAL RESIST THE REFUSAL WHICH IS MADE AND WHICH PROPRIETY DOES NOT REQUIRE

THE SPEAKER OF LEAST IMPORTANCE OUGHT TO TAKE THE LOWER PART OF THE SIDE WALK IN ORDER TO KEEP THE PERSON WITH WHOM HE IS CONVERSING FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CARRIAGES IT WOULD BE SUPREMELY RIDICULOUS TO ENTER INTO A LONG CONVERSATION AND THUS DETAIN AGAINST THEIR WILL THE PERSON ACCOSTED
LADIES TO WHOM THE ADVICE CONTAINED IN THIS PARAGRAPH IS PARTICULARLY ADDRESSED KNOW HOW THE SHADOW OF SUSPICION WITHERS AND TORMENTS THEM THIS SHADOW IT IS NECESSARY TO AVOID AT ALL HAZARDS

THEY MUST SELECT STUFFS FOR WINTER OR SUMMER AS MAY BE SUITABLE
NAMELY THOSE WHICH OFFEND MODESTY PROPRIETY ALLOWS YOU AND IT EVEN REQUIRES YOU NOT TO LISTEN TO BUT EVEN TO INTERRUPT AN ILL BRED PERSON
IF THERE IS A STRANGER WITH THE ONE WHOM WE MEET WE MUST BE CONTENTED WITH SALUTING THE LATTER WITHOUT STOPPING OTHERWISE WE PUT HIS COMPANION IN A DISAGREEABLE POSITION THIS CIVILITY BECOMES A RIGOROUS DUTY IF THEY ARE ACCOMPANIED BY A LADY
NOR SPEAK TO THEM UNTIL THEY HAVE SEPARATED PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED A LITTLE IN THE WORLD KNOW HOW ESSENTIAL IT IS NOT TO MINGLE WITH CURIOSITY IN THE BUSINESS OF PERSONS WHOM WE VISIT
OR AN AGED LADY THEY ARE AT LIBERTY HOWEVER TO WALK WITH YOUNG MARRIED LADIES OR UNMARRIED ONES WHILE THE LATTER SHOULD NEVER WALK ALONE WITH THEIR COMPANIONS
WHEN BOTH THESE QUALITIES ARE REGULATED BY REASON USE AND TASTE IT IS VERY WELL BUT HOW SELDOM IS THIS THE CASE THEY ARE NOT SO USED IF IN THE COURSE OF A DISCUSSION
QUESTIONS ARE THEREFORE NECESSARY BUT THEY DEMAND INFINITE DELICACY AND TACT IN ORDER NEITHER TO FATIGUE NOR EVER WOUND THE FEELINGS IF INSTEAD OF EXPRESSING A MILD AND HEARTFELT INTEREST
A PARTICULAR AND LIMITED SENSE IT SIGNIFIES A WANT OF DUE REGARD TO AND A FORGETFULNESS OF THE DELICATE ATTENTIONS WHICH SEEM TO IDENTIFY US WITH THE SITUATION OF OTHERS
SHOULD TAKE A JOURNAL OR A BOOK FROM HIS POCKET IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY IMPOLITE TO READ OVER HIS SHOULDER AND EQUALLY UNCIVIL TO READ WHAT A PERSON IS WRITING IT IS NOT ALLOWABLE TO TAKE DOWN THE BOOKS FROM A LIBRARY
DO NOT SAY YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND ME BUT I HAVE NOT EXPRESSED MYSELF PROPERLY
WHERE PERSONS ASSEMBLE TOGETHER AND AT THEATRICAL EXHIBITIONS THERE ARE SOME GENERAL ATTENTIONS WHICH WE SHOULD MANIFEST TO THOSE PERSONS WHOM WE MEET THERE IT WOULD BE IMPOLITE TO JOSTLE CONTINUALLY AND IN AN IMPORTUNATE MANNER
LAWYERS LITERARY PEOPLE MILITARY MEN TRAVELLERS INVALIDS AND AGED LADIES OUGHT TO HAVE A PRUDENT AND CONTINUAL DISTRUST OF THE ABUSE OF DIGRESSIONS
OR BY A NOT LESS FOOLISH DESIRE OF MAKING A DISPLAY OF TALENT REMEMBER THAT THE MOST MEAGRE RECITALS WHEN THEY ARE APROPOS FREQUENTLY PLEASE MORE THAN THE BEST THINGS IN THE WORLD WHEN THEY ARE SAID OUT OF TIME
GENTLEMEN MAY CALL IN AN OUTSIDE COAT IN BOOTS AND PANTALOONS AS WHEN THEY ARE ON THEIR ORDINARY BUSINESS IN SHORT THIS DRESS IS PROPER FOR GENTLEMEN'S VISITS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES COMPLAINING HAS ALWAYS A BAD GRACE BANISH FROM YOUR COMPLAINTS ILL NATURE AND ANIMOSITY
BUT IT WOULD BE WEARISOME TO THEM TO MAKE A LONG ENUMERATION OF THE MEMBERS WHO COMPOSE THE FAMILY WE CAN PUT A GENERAL QUESTION DESIGNATING THE MOST IMPORTANT MEMBERS IN CASE OF THE ABSENCE OF NEAR RELATIONS WE ASK THE PERSON WE ARE VISITING IF THEY HAVE HEARD FROM THEM LATELY
WILL BE CONSIDERED AS A TORMENT MADAME NECKER INGENIOUSLY OBSERVES THAT THESE FAVORITE AND FREQUENTLY REPEATED TERMS WITH WHICH WE FILL OUR CONVERSATION SERVE ORDINARILY AS A MARK OF PEOPLE'S CHARACTER
BUT IF YOU HAVE TO DO WITH ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO POSSESSED WITH A MANIA OF DISCUSSION COMMENCE BY CONTRADICTING BEFORE THEY HEAR AND WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO SUSTAIN THE CONTRARY OPINION YIELD TO HIM
WE WILL MENTION SOME EXAMPLES OF THESE PARTICULAR VIOLATIONS OF POLITENESS TO ACCOST SAD PEOPLE WITH A SMILING FACE AND SPRIGHTLY MANNERS WHICH PROVE TO THEM THE LITTLE INTEREST WHICH YOU TAKE IN THEIR SITUATION
IF THE PERSON ADDRESSED HAS A TITLE OR THAT WHICH HE HAS FROM HIS PROFESSION WE SHOULD GIVE IT HIM AS COUNT DOCTOR
BUT IF PEOPLE WHO CULTIVATE LITERATURE AND THE ARTS OUGHT TO APPLY THEMSELVES WITHOUT RELUCTANCE OR ILL HUMOR TO ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF SOCIETY IF THEY OUGHT TO STRIP THEMSELVES OF ALL PRETENSION AND FORGET THEMSELVES OTHERS SHOULD NOT FORGET THEM
WHEN IT IS NOT A MERE WORK OF LOQUACITY MAY BE EMPLOYED IN SERIOUS DISCOURSE AS POLITICAL PHILOSOPHICAL OR MORAL DISCUSSIONS BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO TREAT IT WITH INFINITE RESERVE AND CARE AND NEVER TO INTRODUCE A PERSONAL APOLOGY
IF YOU ARE A MAN AND A LADY OR DISTINGUISHED PERSON ASKS THIS FAVOR OF YOU YOU SHOULD TAKE OFF YOUR HAT WHILE ANSWERING THEM THERE ARE SOME ILL MANNERED AND MALICIOUS PERSONS WHO TAKE PLEASURE IN MISLEADING STRANGERS BY WRONG DIRECTIONS
SO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE ANYTHING EXCELLENT TO RELATE CONSULT LESS YOUR OWN DESIRE TO TELL IT THAN THE WISHES OF OTHERS TO HEAR YOU THERE ARE BUT TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF WEARYING WHILE TELLING VERY GOOD THINGS
NOR ARE THEY IGNORANT WHAT CONDUCT IS TO BE OBSERVED IN CASE WE SURPRISE PERSONS BY AN UNEXPECTED CALL BUT YOUNG PERSONS MAY NOT KNOW AND I BEG THEM TO GIVE THEIR ATTENTION TO IT WHEN WE SEE A PERSON OCCUPIED WE RETIRE
THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE INTERRUPTION OR RELAXATION BUT IT SHOULD BE FREE FROM ALL IMPOLITENESS AND INDELICACY
AND COMPARISONS THE TWO SHOALS TO BE AVOIDED IN THIS FORM OF LANGUAGE ARE DIRECTLY OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER THE ONE IS TRIVIALITY THE OTHER BOMBAST THE OBJECT OF SUPPOSITION WHICH IS ALREADY ANTIQUATED AND SOMETIMES TOO SIMPLE
TO THEIR INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCES THEIR SUPERIORS AND TO THOSE PERSONS TO WHOM THEY OWE RESPECT ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE WORK AND TO THE PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY HAVE RELATIONS OF PLEASURE OR OF BUSINESS
IF WE REPEL IT WE ONLY SEEM TO EXCITE IT THE MORE THUS WE SEE IN SUCH A CASE AND EVEN AMONG VERY CLEVER PERSONS TOO THOSE WHO REPLY BY SILLY EXCLAMATIONS AND BY RUDE ASSERTIONS YOU WERE LAUGHING AT ME THEY SAY
EVEN THOUGH IT BE ONLY TO READ THE SUPERSCRIPTION IF THE PERSON VISITED SHOULD BE OPENING A CLOSET OR DRAWERS IT WOULD BE RUDE CURIOSITY TO APPROACH IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT WAS CONTAINED THERE IF AMONG A NUMBER OF VALUABLE THINGS
WE SHOULD MAKE THEM DURING THE WEEK A VISIT OF THANKS AT WHICH WE MAY CONVERSE OF THE PLEASURE OF THE BALL AND OF THE GOOD SELECTION OF THE COMPANY SECTION TWO OF CONCERTS
THIS CANNOT BE TOLERATED IT IS TO BE SUPPOSED THAT THE PERSON WHO PRAISES YOU IS INCAPABLE OF SUCH AN ACT I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SAY I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE SO KIND OR SO GOOD I SHOULD INDEED THINK YOU WERE JOKING ME OR ELSE WE SHOULD SAY
AND DRAW THEM TOWARDS THE RIGHT SIDE TO RAISE THE DRESS ON BOTH SIDES AND WITH BOTH HANDS IS VULGAR THIS UNGRACEFUL PRACTICE CAN BE TOLERATED ONLY FOR A MOMENT WHEN THE MUD IS VERY DEEP
IF PERCEIVING THAT YOU ARE EMBARRASSED AND THAT YOU ENDEAVOR TO SAVE YOURSELF BY AN EVASIVE ANSWER INSTEAD OF KEEPING SILENCE YOU WITNESS THE FOOLISH REGRETS OF YOUR INDISCRETION BE ASSURED THAT BOTH YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOURSELF
THE FORMER SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY ONE OR TWO OTHER MARRIED LADIES AND THE LATTER BY THEIR MOTHER OR BY A LADY TO REPRESENT HER WE SHOULD AVOID TALKING TOO MUCH IT WOULD OCCASION REMARKS AND HAVE A BAD APPEARANCE
OR TO PRETEND TO RECOGNIZE IN THE PORTRAIT OF A YOUNG LADY THE LIKENESS OF AN ELDERLY LADY OR OF ONE LESS FAVORED BY NATURE IT WOULD MOREOVER BE IMPROPER TO MAKE LONG COMPLIMENTS INDIRECT AND INGENIOUS PRAISE IS ALL THAT IS PROPER SECTION TWO
PUT TO HIM QUESTIONS WHICH PROVE YOUR DESIRE TO BE INITIATED INTO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE ARTS
TO ANY LADIES NEXT TO HER FOR THESE NOT BEING ABLE TO REFUSE YOU WOULD FEEL HURT AT BEING INVITED AFTER ANOTHER NEVER WAIT UNTIL THE SIGNAL IS GIVEN TO TAKE A PARTNER FOR NOTHING IS MORE IMPOLITE THAN TO INVITE A LADY HASTILY
LEAVE OTHERS TO POINT OUT THE STRIKING PARTS WHICH HAVE PLEASED THEM THE SUREST MEANS OF NOT HAVING THE APPROBATION OF OTHERS IN ACTIONS AS WELL AS OTHER THINGS IS TO SOLICIT IT WHETHER IT BE BY LOOKS OR BY WORDS
TO WHISPER CONTINUALLY IN THE EAR OF OUR PARTNER
INTEREST CUSTOM AND THE DESIRE OF PARTICULAR ESTEEM THE NECESSITY OF MODERATING THE ENTHUSIASM WHICH ALMOST CONSTANTLY ANIMATES US ARE THE MOTIVES WHICH DETERMINE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF POLITENESS THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONSIDER
AND PROMISE TO MAKE REPARATION FOR YOUR NEGLECT ON HIS PART THE PERSON WHO IS UNDER THE OBLIGATION TO YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL OF USING A SINGLE TERM OF REPROACH AND OF ACCOSTING YOU WITH AN AIR OF DISSATISFACTION
POLITENESS OF ARTISTS AND AUTHORS AND THE DEFERENCE DUE TO THEM DO ARTISTS COME UNDER THE COMMON RULE IT WILL PERHAPS BE SAID AND I SHALL ASK IN MY TURN DO THEY LIVE LIKE OTHERS
WHOM YOU OUGHT ALWAYS TO TREAT KINDLY AS TO YOUR OWN DOMESTICS
FOR A HUSBAND OR A WIFE IS ANOTHER SELF AND WE MUST FORGET THAT SELF MOTHERS IN PARTICULAR SPARE NO CARESSES TOWARDS YOUR CHILDREN OCCUPY YOURSELVES ENTIRELY WITH THEM
MARRIED LADIES ARE ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR HUSBANDS UNMARRIED ONES BY THEIR MOTHER OR BY A CHAPERON THESE LAST LADIES PLACE THEMSELVES BEHIND THE DANCERS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE GOES BEFORE ONE AND ANOTHER
OR EXPOSE THEMSELVES EVERY DAY FOR A SARCASM TO SPORT WITH THEIR OWN LIFE AND THAT OF ANOTHER IN A DUEL SUCH PEOPLE WHAT ARE THEY IN TRUTH I DARE NOT SAY ONE SUCH PICTURE WHICH CERTAINLY IS NOT HIGHLY COLORED
THEY EXPRESS SUCH FEELING REGRET THAT THEY STILL INSPIRE US WITH GRATITUDE IN SHORT THEIR CONDUCT APPEARS SO PERFECTLY NATURAL THAT IT REALLY SEEMS THAT THE OPPORTUNITY WHICH IS OFFERED THEM OF OBLIGING US
THAT THIS OPINION IS ALMOST EXCUSABLE NOW THIS PREJUDICE LAYS IT DOWN AS A RULE THAT EVERY FEMALE AUTHOR OR ARTIST MAY BE KNOWN AT FIRST SIGHT BY HER ODDITIES HER WANT OF MODESTY OR HER PEDANTIC FOLLY
SO GREAT IS THEIR TRIFLING IN THIS RESPECT THAT THEY CAN BE JUSTLY COMPARED TO THOSE FALSE HEROES WHO ARE ALWAYS TALKING OF FIGHTING AND WHO WOULD BE PUT TO FLIGHT AT THE SIGHT OF A DRAWN SWORD THESE INDICATIONS OF ZEAL ARE SUSPICIOUS
THESE MEN ALWAYS ABSORBED IN ONE STRONG AND SINGLE CONCEPTION WITH WHICH THEY LIKE THE CREATOR WISH TO ANIMATE MATTER WHO SEEK EVERYWHERE THE SECRET OF THE BEAUTIFUL WHICH GOADS INFATUATES AND EVADES THEM
POLITENESS AND TASTE CANNOT AT ALL EXIST IN COMPARISONS IF THEY ARE COMMON OR TRIVIAL AS WHEN WE SAY BLACK AS THE CHIMNEY BACK
MY PEOPLE WELL BRED PERSONS SIMPLY SAY THE NURSE THE COOK THE CHAMBER MAID
CERTAIN FASHIONABLES SEEK TO GAIN A KIND OF REPUTATION BY THE ODD CHOICE OF THEIR ATTIRE AND BY THEIR EAGERNESS TO SEIZE UPON THE FIRST CAPRICES OF THE FASHIONS
ALL LADIES CANNOT USE INDISCRIMINATELY THE PRIVILEGE WHICH MARRIAGE CONFERS UPON THEM IN THIS RESPECT AND THE TOILET OF THOSE WHOSE FORTUNE IS MODERATE SHOULD NOT PASS THE BOUNDS OF AN ELEGANT SIMPLICITY
IN THESE ASSEMBLIES WE OUGHT TO CONDUCT OURSELVES WITH RESERVE AND POLITENESS TOWARDS ALL PRESENT ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE UNKNOWN TO US PERSONS WHO HAVE NO EAR FOR MUSIC THAT IS TO SAY A FALSE ONE OUGHT TO REFRAIN FROM DANCING
AND INSTEAD OF THE PLURAL FORM WE RESOLVED WE DID SUCH A THING YOU SHOULD FORGET YOURSELF AND SAY MISTER N RESOLVED OR DID SUCH A THING SO AND SO DELICACY WILL DICTATE THIS DEGREE OF MODESTY TO YOU
AND YOUR SUPERIOR IN HIS TURN WILL PROCLAIM AT HIS OWN EXPENSE YOUR MERIT ON THE OCCASION WE KNOW THAT THE WORD FALSE IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE DICTIONARY OF POLITENESS AND THAT WHEN WE ARE OBLIGED TO DENY THE ASSERTION OF ANY ONE WE EMPLOY
AS EVERY HEARER IS OBLIGED TO LISTEN OR UNDERSTAND WITHOUT OBJECTING THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT WE SHOULD FEEL OUR GROUND BEFORE SPEAKING
AND YET RETURN HOME AFTER A WALK OF SEVERAL HOURS WITHOUT SOILING THEIR CLOTHES IN THE LEAST TO ARRIVE AT THIS ASTONISHING RESULT WHICH CAUSES THE WONDER AND VEXATION OF PROVINCIAL VISITORS ON THEIR FIRST COMING TO PARIS
THE DUTIES OF DISCRETION ARE SO SENSIBLY FELT BY PERSONS OF GOOD BREEDING THAT THEY DO NOT VIOLATE THEM EXCEPT THROUGH FORGETFULNESS IT WILL BE ENOUGH THEN TO MAKE AN ENUMERATION OF THEM
TO SEE THE NEW FASHIONS AND WHO WITH THIS OBJECT MAKE THE SHOPKEEPER OPEN A HUNDRED BUNDLES SHOW HEAPS OF GOODS AND FINISH BY GOING OUT SAYING IN A DISDAINFUL TONE THAT NOTHING SUITS THEM THERE ARE SOME MERCILESS PURCHASERS
THE ARTICLES FOR WHICH HE HAS INQUIRED IF THE PURCHASER BE DIFFICULT TO SUIT CAPRICIOUS RIDICULOUS OR EVEN DISDAINFUL THE SHOPKEEPER OUGHT NOT TO APPEAR TO PERCEIVE IT HE MAY HOWEVER IN SUCH CASES
UNLESS SHE GOES THERE TO STUDY OR WORK AS AN ARTIST A LADY OUGHT TO HAVE A MODEST AND MEASURED GAIT TOO GREAT HURRY INJURES THE GRACE WHICH OUGHT TO CHARACTERIZE HER
AND AVOID LEANING OVER TOO MUCH
HAVE FREQUENTLY GIVEN TO THESE ATTENTIONS THE NAMES OF COQUETRY AMBITION OR FOLLY THIS IS A STILL STRONGER REASON WHY WE SHOULD ENDEAVOR TO CLEAR UP THESE POINTS
THEY SHOULD BE REMOVED AS SOON AS MAY BE IN THIS DRESS WE CAN RECEIVE ONLY INTIMATE FRIENDS OR PERSONS WHO CALL UPON URGENT OR INDISPENSABLE BUSINESS EVEN THEN WE OUGHT TO OFFER SOME APOLOGY FOR IT
AND IF HE HAPPENS TO IMPART TO YOU WHAT HE RELATED THE PRECEDING DAY WHICH HE HAD FROM YOU YOURSELF YOU SHOULD APPEAR TO LISTEN WITH EQUAL INTEREST AS IF FOR THE FIRST TIME FREQUENTLY IN THE MIDST OF A RECITAL
WITH WHICH THEY ARE CONTINUALLY OCCUPIED LET THEM ALWAYS BE IN FEAR OF OBTAINING THE NAME OF A BEL ESPRIT A NAME WHICH CALLS UP SO MANY RECOLLECTIONS OF PEDANTRY AND AFFECTATION A GRACEFUL SIMPLICITY
ASK THE FAVOR OF SEEING HIS PICTURES OR OF HEARING HIS SYMPHONIES CONTEMPLATE THE FORMER A LONG TIME LISTEN TO THE LATTER WITH GREAT ATTENTION ADDRESS TO HIM LIVELY CONGRATULATIONS MINGLED WITH THANKS THEN BY AN ADROIT TRANSITION
IN REMARKABLE AND REMOTE COUNTRIES ON BIRTH DAYS OR DAYS OF BAPTISM OR NEW YEAR'S DAY BUT THIS DAY IS NOT THE ONLY OCCASION OF EXCHANGING PRESENTS IN A FAMILY IT IS ALSO AN OCCASION FOR RECOLLECTING SERVICES AND CIVILITIES
WHEN MISS NIGHTINGALE AND HER NURSES STEPPED ASHORE THEY WERE MET BY A BAND OF WOMEN IN SNOWY CAPS AND RAINBOW STRIPED PETTICOATS ALL WITH OUTSTRETCHED HANDS ALL CRYING WELCOME WELCOME OUR ENGLISH SISTERS THEY KNEW
I SHALL THEREFORE DESCRIBE THE SITUATION AND THE WORK AS SHE FOUND IT THERE IF THERE HAD BEEN MISMANAGEMENT AT HOME IN ENGLAND THERE HAD BEEN EVEN WORSE AT THE SEAT OF WAR
THE LITTLE FINGERS GROWN SO SKILLFUL BY BANDAGING WAXEN AND CHINA ARMS AND LEGS WERE NOW TO SAVE A LIVING LOVING CREATURE FROM DEATH TO EVERY ENGLISH CHILD THIS STORY IS A NURSERY TALE
AND THE LOOK OF AGONY ON THOSE POOR DYING FACES WILL NEVER LEAVE MY HEART THEY MAY WELL BE CALLED THE MARTYRS OF THE CRIMEA WHERE WERE THE DOCTORS THEY WERE THERE DOING THEIR VERY BEST WORKING DAY AND NIGHT
THERE WERE STILL OTHER OBJECTIONS WHICH WERE STRONGLY FELT IN THOSE DAYS HOWEVER STRANGE THEY MAY SOUND IN OUR EARS TO DAY OH DREADFUL SAID SOME PEOPLE MISS NIGHTINGALE IS A UNITARIAN
AND IN OVER THIS DREADFUL RAMPART RODE MOHAMMED ON HIS WAR HORSE AND AS HE RODE HE LIFTED HIS BLOODY RIGHT HAND AND SMOTE ONE OF THE PILLARS AND THERE SO THE STORY SAYS
THE FRAIL BODY ANSWERED THE CALL OF THE POWERFUL WILL THE UNDAUNTED MIND THE GREAT HEART NOW THAT THE TASK WAS FINISHED IT SANK DOWN BROKEN AND EXHAUSTED
THEN HE CRAWLED FROM UNDER THE TABLE WHERE HE LAY DRAGGED HIMSELF TO FLORENCE'S FEET AND LOOKED UP PITIFULLY IN HER FACE SHE KNELT DOWN BY HIM AND SOOTHED AND PETTED AND TALKED TO HIM WHILE THE GOOD CLERGYMAN EXAMINED THE INJURED LEG
INDEED IT IS ALMOST A CHAIN OF SEVEN LAKES CONNECTED BY SEVEN SWIFT RUSHING CURRENTS THE PROMONTORIES ARE CROWNED WITH VILLAGES TOWNS PALACES RUINS EACH WITH ITS OWN BEAUTY
AND IT ECHOED FAR AND WIDE EVERYBODY WHO COULD WRITE VERSES AND MANY WHO COULD NOT BEGAN INSTANTLY TO WRITE ABOUT NIGHTINGALES PUNCH PRINTED A CARTOON SHOWING A HOSPITAL WARD
TO TEND AND NURSE THE SICK AND WOUNDED AND DYING BUT WHO SHOULD LEAD THEM WHAT ONE WOMAN HAD THE STRENGTH THE POWER THE WISDOM THE TENDERNESS TO MEET AND OVERCOME THE TERRIBLE CONDITIONS
CALLED UPON THE OTHER EUROPEAN POWERS TO HELP HER THE RESULT WAS THAT ENGLAND FRANCE SARDINIA NOW A PART OF ITALY BUT THEN A SEPARATE KINGDOM AND TURKEY MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH ONE ANOTHER AND ALL TOGETHER
BUT THERE WERE FEW DEARER TO HIM THAN FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE THEY HAD THE SAME TASTES AND FEELINGS BOTH LOVED TO HELP AND COMFORT ALL WHO WERE IN TROUBLE SORROW NEED SICKNESS OR ANY OTHER ADVERSITY
SEEMS TO BE THAT THEY DID NOT TELL THOUGH MISTER RUSSELL AND OTHERS WROTE TO ENGLAND OF THE HORRORS OF THE HOSPITALS
TO CONCEAL HER FROM THE EYES OF HERA HIS JEALOUS WIFE ZEUS TURNED IO INTO A SNOW WHITE HEIFER BUT HERA SUSPECTING THE TRUTH PERSUADED HIM TO GIVE THE POOR PRETTY CREATURE TO HER
BY THE READINESS OF FEMININE INVENTION SINGING FEVER'S THIRST ALLAYED AND THE BED YOU'VE TUMBLED MADE WITH A CHEERFUL AND CONSIDERATE ATTENTION SINGING SUCCOUR TO THE BRAVE AND A RESCUE FROM THE GRAVE
AND HE WROTE DAY AFTER DAY HOME TO ENGLAND TELLING WHAT HE SAW AND WHAT WAS NEEDED SOON AFTER BALAKLAVA HE WROTE ARE THERE NO DEVOTED WOMEN AMONGST US
THE AIR OF WHICH WAS HEAVY WITH THE POISON OF CHOLERA AND FEVER AN ORDERLY OFFICER TOOK THE ROUNDS OF THE WARDS EVERY NIGHT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS IN ORDER HE WAS OF COURSE EXPECTED BY THE ORDERLIES
I WISH EVERY GIRL AND EVERY BOY WHO READS THIS STORY WOULD TRY TO FIND THAT SLENDER DINGY VOLUME IN SOME LIBRARY AND READ MARK LEARN AND INWARDLY DIGEST ITS CONTENTS THEY WOULD KNOW A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN THEY DO NOW
BOTH OWED THEIR FIRST IMPULSE TO THE PEBBLE DROPPED BY FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE EVEN HER OWN LIFE GIVEN FREELY TO SUFFERING HUMANITY
CAME THROUGH THE JAWS OF DEATH BACK FROM THE MOUTH OF HELL ALL THAT WAS LEFT OF THEM LEFT OF SIX HUNDRED WHEN CAN THEIR GLORY FADE O THE WILD CHARGE THEY MADE ALL THE WORLD WONDERED
WHOSE GLORY WAS SOON TO SHINE OVER ALL THE WORLD LEFT THE SHORES OF ENGLAND BUT THOUGH ENGLAND SLEPT THAT NIGHT FRANCE WAS WIDE AWAKE THE NEXT MORNING THE FISHWIVES OF BOULOGNE HAD HEARD WHAT WAS DOING ACROSS THE CHANNEL AND WERE ON THE LOOKOUT
SHE WAS THE ONE WOMAN IN ENGLAND WHO WAS CAPABLE OF PERFORMING THIS GREAT TASK I MUST NOT CONCEAL FROM YOU THAT UPON YOUR DECISION WILL DEPEND THE ULTIMATE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF THE PLAN IF THIS SUCCEEDS
IT HAD BEEN MEANT FOR THE HARDY TURKISH SOLDIERY TO SLEEP IN AND THERE WERE NO APPLIANCES TO FIT IT FOR A HOSPITAL WE ARE TOLD THAT IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE WAR THERE WERE NO VESSELS FOR WATER OR UTENSILS OF ANY KIND
CANNON TO RIGHT OF THEM CANNON TO LEFT OF THEM CANNON IN FRONT OF THEM VOLLEYED AND THUNDERED STORMED AT WITH SHOT AND SHELL BOLDLY THEY RODE AND WELL INTO THE JAWS OF DEATH
THEY ARE GREAT ROUNDED HILLS COVERED WITH CLOSE THICK TURF LIKE A VELVET CARPET THEY SPREAD IN LONG SMOOTH GREEN BILLOWS MILES AND MILES OF THEM
THEY ENTERED AND THERE LAY CAP ON THE BRICK FLOOR HELPLESS AND WEAK BUT STILL BARKING AS HARD AS HE COULD AT WHAT HE SUPPOSED TO BE INTRUDERS WHEN HE SAW FLORENCE AND THE LITTLE BOY HE STOPPED BARKING AND WAGGED HIS TAIL FEEBLY
THE LETTERS V R SURMOUNTED BY A CROWN IN DIAMONDS ARE IMPRESSED UPON THE CENTRE OF THE CROSS GREEN ENAMEL BRANCHES OF PALM TIPPED WITH GOLD FORM THE FRAMEWORK OF THE SHIELD WHILE AROUND THEIR STEMS IS A RIBAND OF BLUE ENAMEL
FRANCE HAS SENT FORTH HER SISTERS OF MERCY UNSPARINGLY AND THEY ARE EVEN NOW BY THE BEDSIDES OF THE WOUNDED AND THE DYING GIVING WHAT WOMAN'S HAND ALONE CAN GIVE OF COMFORT AND RELIEF
BUT HE IS NOT NEARLY SO POWERFUL AND PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS ON THE LOOKOUT FOR HIM AND CAN GENERALLY DRIVE HIM AWAY THIS WAS THE STATE OF THINGS WHEN MISS NIGHTINGALE AND HER BAND OF NURSES ARRIVED AT SCUTARI
HER SICK ROOM BECAME ONE OF THE BUSIEST PLACES IN ALL ENGLAND
NOT A PROPHET BUT A GREAT SOLDIER SURNAMED THE CONQUEROR WHO FINALLY CONQUERED IT IN FOURTEEN FIFTY THREE AFTER ANOTHER TREMENDOUS SIEGE OF WHICH YOU WILL READ IN HISTORY
THEY WERE TORTURED BY FEVER AND THIRST AND NOW THEY MUST WALK IF THEY COULD DRAG THEMSELVES OR BE DRAGGED OR CARRIED BY OTHERS UP THE HILL TO THE HOSPITAL WE CAN FANCY HOW THEY LOOKED FORWARD TO REST HOW THEY THOUGHT OF COMFORT AID
WHAT IS THE MATTER ROGER HE ASKED KINDLY WHERE IS YOUR DOG THE BOYS HAVE BEEN THROWING STONES AT HIM SIR REPLIED THE OLD MAN THEY HAVE BROKEN HIS LEG POOR BEAST AND HE WILL NEVER BE GOOD FOR ANYTHING AGAIN
THEN FOLLOWED A SAD TIME HERA SET ARGUS A GIANT WITH A HUNDRED EYES TO WATCH THE HEIFER
WHICH STUNG HER CRUELLY AND PURSUED HER OVER LAND AND SEA THE POOR CREATURE FLED WILDLY HITHER AND THITHER SWAM ACROSS THE IONIAN SEA WHICH HAS BORNE HER NAME EVER SINCE
WHO NEEDED HELP HE HEARD WITH DEEP DISTRESS THE DREADFUL TIDINGS OF SUFFERING THAT CAME FROM THE CRIMEA AND HIS HEART RESPONDED INSTANTLY TO THE CALL FOR HELP YES THE WOMEN OF ENGLAND MUST RISE UP AND GO TO THAT FAR DESOLATE LAND
TRULY SHE HAD GIVEN HER LIFE AS MUCH AS ANY SOLDIER WHO FOUGHT AND DIED IN THE TRENCHES OR ON THE BATTLEFIELD AND WHAT DID SHE DO WHEN SHE FINALLY CAME TO REALIZE THIS DID SHE GIVE UP AND SAY MY WORK ON EARTH IS DONE NOT SHE
YOUNG ABOUT THE AGE OF OUR QUEEN GRACEFUL FEMININE RICH POPULAR SHE HOLDS A SINGULARLY GENTLE AND PERSUASIVE INFLUENCE OVER ALL WITH WHOM SHE COMES IN CONTACT
THESE WERE THE SCENES AMONG WHICH SHE WAS TO LIVE FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS BUT ONE THING MORE MUST BE NOTED DO YOU THINK EVERYONE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND HER NURSES NOT BY ANY MEANS
HOW TO MANAGE EVERY SORT OF APPLICATION FROM A POULTICE TO A LEECH WHOM YOU HAVEN'T GOT TO TEACH THE WAY TO MAKE A POPPY FOMENTATION SINGING PILLOW FOR YOU SMOOTHED SMART AND ACHE AND ANGUISH SOOTHED
IF THEY WANTED HELP ABOUT THEIR PENSIONS THEY WERE TOLD TO PUT IT DOWN IN WRITING AND MISS FLORENCE'S MAID CAME WITH AN ANSWER OF COURSE SHE WAS WILLING TO HELP EVERYBODY BUT IT STOOD TO REASON SHE COULD NOT RECEIVE THEM ALL WHY THE PARK WOULDN'T HAVE HELD ALL THE FOLKS THAT CAME AND BESIDES
ALL THESE MUST BE BROUGHT TO MISS NIGHTINGALE ALL THE SOLDIERS IN THE COUNTRY MUST WRITE TO HER WHENEVER THEY WANTED ANYTHING FROM A PENSION DOWN TO A WOODEN LEG TO THEIR HONOR BE IT SAID HOWEVER
WHEN I NEED NOT SHRINK TO MEET THOSE GREAT PLACARDS IN THE STREET THAT FOR WEEKS WILL GHASTLY STARE IN SOME EYES CHILD SAY THAT PRAYER ONCE AGAIN A DIFFERENT ONE SAY O GOD THY WILL BE DONE
NOT FAR FROM THIS GREAT CEMETERY IS ANOTHER PLACE OF BURIAL THAT OF THE ENGLISH AND THIS IS LAID OUT LIKE A LOVELY GARDEN AND WATCHED AND TENDED WITH LOVING CARE
AND WILL FIND OUT JUST WHAT THESE MEANT IN THE FIFTIES BUT THIS IS ALL THAT YOU NEED KNOW NOW IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR TURKEY FEELING THAT RUSSIA WAS PRESSING TOO HARD UPON HER
WHILE NEITHER GAINED ANY SIGNAL ADVANTAGE
AS THE HEAT DREW OUT THE INFLAMMATION AND PAIN CAP LOOKED UP AT THE LITTLE HELPER ALL HIS SIMPLE DOG HEART SHINING IN HIS EYES THE LOOK SANK INTO THE CHILD'S HEART AND DEEPENED THE TENDERNESS ALREADY THERE ANOTHER STEP
LOOK WHERE FATHER'S PICTURE STANDS FATHER THAT HERE KISSED HIS BOY NOT A MONTH SINCE FATHER KIND WHO THIS NIGHT MAY NEVER MIND MOTHER'S SOB MY WILLIE DEAR CRY OUT LOUD THAT HE MAY HEAR
NOT A SOLDIER EVER ASKED HER FOR MONEY THE NIGHTINGALE FUND NOW NEARLY FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS WAS ADMINISTERED UNDER HER ADVICE AND DIRECTION AND THE FIRST TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES ORGANIZED AND OPENED THE OLD INCAPABLE IGNORANT NURSE VANISHED
IN THE TWENTIES AND THIRTIES WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN BADLY OFF WHEN THE TERRIBLE FIFTIES CAME IF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE HAD NOT PLAYED WITH HER DOLLS READ ON AND SEE FOR YOURSELVES FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE LOVED HER DOLLS DEARLY
THIS WAS THE TRUMPET CALL THAT RANG IN THE EARS OF THE WOMEN OF ENGLAND SOUNDING A CLEARER NOTE THAN ALL THE CLARIONS OF VICTORY
MISS NIGHTINGALE SIMPLY DRESSED IN BLACK WAS VERY QUIET VERY SERENE WITH A CHEERFUL WORD FOR EVERYONE NO ONE WHO SAW HER PARTING LOOK AND SMILE EVER FORGOT THEM SO IN NIGHT AND SILENCE THE ANGEL BAND
BUT BETTER THAN ALL IS THE SOUL'S GLORY THAT SHINES THROUGH EVERY FEATURE SO EXULTINGLY NOTHING CAN BE SWEETER THAN HER SMILE IT IS LIKE A SUNNY DAY IN SUMMER THOUGH WELL KNOWN AMONG A LARGE CIRCLE OF EARNEST AND HIGH MINDED PERSONS
AND EVERYTHING ELSE APART THEY WERE DELIGHTED WITH ITS BEAUTY HAD SHE BEEN PLAIN MARY SMITH SHE WOULD HAVE DONE JUST AS GOOD WORK BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR HARDER FOR HER TO START IT FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE WAS A NAME TO CONJURE WITH AS THE SAYING IS
AND MORE PLEASE HORSE LANGUAGE IS A SIMPLE ONE COMPARED TO ENGLISH AND HAS NO GRAMMAR WELL ONE DAY FLORENCE WAS RIDING HER PONY IN COMPANY WITH HER FRIEND THE VICAR THIS GOOD MAN LOVED ALL LIVING CREATURES
OR IF QUESTIONED WOULD ONLY REPLY THAT EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT THERE WAS NO INSPECTION THAT WAS WORTHY OF THE NAME THE SAME OFFICERS WHO WOULD FRONT DEATH ON THE BATTLEFIELD WITH A SONG AND A LAUGH SHRANK FROM MEETING IT IN THE HOSPITAL WARDS
THE ENGLISH TROOPS WERE IN AN ENEMY'S COUNTRY AND A POOR COUNTRY AT THAT WHATEVER SUPPLIES THERE WERE HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THE RUSSIAN ARMIES FOR THEIR OWN NEEDS FOOD AND CLOTHING HAD BEEN SENT OUT FROM ENGLAND IN GREAT QUANTITIES
IT IS TO SCUTARI THAT WE ARE GOING BUT WE MUST NOT PASS THE OTHER PLACES WITHOUT A WORD FOR THEY ARE VERY FAMOUS THIS IS THE LAND OF STORY AND EVERY FOOT OF GROUND EVERY TRICKLE OF WATER
DECLARED WAR UPON RUSSIA ENGLAND HAD BEEN AT PEACE WITH ALL THE WORLD FOR FORTY YEARS EVER SINCE THE WARS OF NAPOLEON WHICH WERE CLOSED BY THE GREAT VICTORY OF WATERLOO THE ENGLISH ARE A BRAVE RACE
AS I DID ABROAD AND NO HOUR HAVE I GIVEN TO FRIENDSHIP OR AMUSEMENT DURING THAT TIME BUT ALL TO WORK DROP A STONE IN THE WATER AND SEE HOW THE CIRCLES SPREAD GROWING WIDER AND WIDER
AND THE MODERN NURSE EDUCATED METHODICAL CLEAR EYED AND CLEAR HEADED TOOK HER PLACE QUIETLY ONE OF THE GREAT CHANGES OF MODERN TIMES WAS EFFECTED AND THE HAND THAT DIRECTED IT WAS THE SAME ONE THAT WE HAVE SEEN HOLDING THE LAMP
THROUGH ALL THE LONG WEARISOME JOURNEY
THESE MEN DIE WITHOUT THE LEAST EFFORT BEING MADE TO SAVE THEM THERE THEY LIE JUST AS THEY WERE LET GENTLY DOWN ON THE GROUND BY THE POOR FELLOWS THEIR COMRADES WHO BROUGHT THEM ON THEIR BACKS FROM THE CAMP WITH THE GREATEST TENDERNESS
GO OUT TO SCUTARI TAKING WITH HER A BAND OF NURSES WHO WOULD BE UNDER HER ORDERS AND TAKE CHARGE OF THE HOSPITAL NURSING HE DID NOT MAKE LIGHT OF THE TASK THE SELECTION OF THE RANK AND FILE OF NURSES WOULD BE DIFFICULT
ACROSS TO SCUTARI SEVERAL DAYS WOULD PASS BEFORE ANY WERE GOT FROM THE BATTLEFIELD TO THE FERRY BELOW THE HOSPITAL AND MOST OF THEM HAD NOT HAD THEIR WOUNDS DRESSED OR THEIR BROKEN LIMBS SET OFTEN THEY HAD HAD NO FOOD
CANNON TO RIGHT OF THEM CANNON TO LEFT OF THEM CANNON BEHIND THEM VOLLEYED AND THUNDERED STORMED AT WITH SHOT AND SHELL WHILE HORSE AND HERO FELL THEY THAT HAD FOUGHT SO WELL
YOU SEE A NARROW STRAIT MARKED BOSPORUS LEADING FROM THE BLACK SEA TO THE SEA OF MARMORA AND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE STRAIT A BLACK DOT ONE MARKED CONSTANTINOPLE THE OTHER SCUTARI
AND TO PERSONS DESERVING EVERYTHING AT OUR HANDS AND WHICH WILL MULTIPLY THE GOOD TO ALL TIME IT WAS A NOBLE LETTER THIS OF MISTER HERBERT'S BUT HE MIGHT HAVE SPARED HIMSELF THE TROUBLE OF WRITING IT
THE PROVINCE OF TAURIDA YET IT IS ONE OF THE FAMOUS PLACES OF HISTORY FOR HERE IN THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE WAS FOUGHT THE CRIMEAN WAR ONE OF THE GREATEST WARS OF MODERN TIMES
TO THE BLUE SEA TOSSING AND TUMBLING BELOW THESE ARE THE WHITE CLIFFS OF ENGLAND THAT YOU HAVE SO OFTEN READ ABOUT AM I NEVER GOING ON WITH THE STORY YES HAVE PATIENCE THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME
AND HERE AGAIN SHE LEFT
WE WHO NEED NOT JUST TO KEEP REASON CLEAR IN THOUGHT AND BRAIN TILL THE MORNING COMES AGAIN TILL THE THIRD DREAD MORNING TELL WHO THEY WERE THAT FOUGHT AND FELL
WE ARE TOLD THAT THESE LONG NARROW ROOMS IF PLACED END TO END WOULD COVER FOUR MILES OF GROUND AT EACH CORNER ROSE A TOWER THE BUILDING WAS WELL SITUATED AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE BOSPORUS TOWARD THE GLITTERING MOSQUES AND MINARETS OF STAMBOUL
IN PLANNING AND MANAGING THEIR MANY CHARITIES HOSPITALS HOMES FOR SICK CHILDREN AND SO FORTH HE KNEW THAT SHE POSSESSED ALL THE QUALITIES NEEDED FOR THIS WORK AND HE WROTE TO HER ASKING IF SHE WOULD UNDERTAKE IT WOULD SHE HE ASKED
LIES CONSTANTINOPLE THE WONDER CITY HERE INDEED WE MUST STOP FOR A MOMENT FOR THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS CITIES OF HISTORY IN ANCIENT DAYS WHEN ROME WAS IN HER GLORY
ROAMED OVER THE WHOLE BREADTH OF WHAT IS NOW TURKEY AND FINALLY CAME TO THE NARROW STRAIT OR FORD BETWEEN THE TWO SEAS
AND TOOK THE GREATEST POSSIBLE CARE OF THEM AND YET THEY WERE ALWAYS DELICATE AND GIVEN TO SUDDEN AND ALARMING ILLNESSES A DOLL NEVER KNEW WHEN SHE MIGHT BE TOLD THAT SHE WAS VERY ILL AND UNDRESSED AND PUT TO BED
LYING ON THE FLOOR WITH THE RATS RUNNING OVER THEM SHE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOWS UNDER THEM WERE LYING DEAD ANIMALS IN EVERY STATE OF DECAY REFUSE AND FILTH OF EVERY DESCRIPTION SHE SOUGHT THE KITCHENS
BEEN A RENDEZVOUS FOR CARAVANS MESSENGERS TRAVELERS OF EVERY DESCRIPTION HERE XENOPHON AND HIS GREEKS RETURNING FROM THE WAR AGAINST CYRUS
THE BARRACK HOSPITAL THE BARRACK HOSPITAL AT SCUTARI WAS JUST WHAT ITS NAME IMPLIES IT WAS BUILT FOR SOLDIERS TO LIVE IN AND WAS BIG ENOUGH TO TAKE IN WHOLE REGIMENTS SURROUNDING THE FOUR SIDES OF A QUADRANGLE
AND THE COLD SO INTENSE THAT MANY SOLDIERS WERE FROZEN IN THEIR TENTS NO ONE MEANT TO BE CRUEL OR NEGLECTFUL BUT THERE WERE NOT HALF ENOUGH DOCTORS AND THINK OF IT CHILDREN THERE WERE NO NURSES HOW DID THIS HAPPEN
SENT HER BY THE SULTAN OF TURKEY I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY MORE JEWELS BUT TWO GIFTS THAT MISS NIGHTINGALE PRIZED HIGHLY
THEY ARE PLUNGED INTO THE INEVITABLE MISERIES OF A WINTER CAMPAIGN AND NOT A SOUL SEEMS TO CARE FOR THEIR COMFORT OR EVEN FOR THEIR LIVES THESE ARE HARD TRUTHS BUT THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND MUST HEAR THEM
