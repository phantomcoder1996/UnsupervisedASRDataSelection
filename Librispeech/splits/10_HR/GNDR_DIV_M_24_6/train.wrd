THE GENERAL WILL SEND A SERVANT WITH ME I DARE SAY HALF THE WAY AND THEN I SHALL SOON BE AT SALISBURY AND THEN I AM ONLY NINE MILES FROM HOME AH CATHERINE WERE IT SETTLED SO IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT LESS INTOLERABLE
OH BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN THERE SO LONG NAY IF YOU CAN USE SUCH A WORD I CAN URGE YOU NO FARTHER IF YOU THINK IT LONG OH NO I DO NOT INDEED
I AM EXCESSIVELY CONCERNED THAT HE SHOULD HAVE ANY REGARD FOR ME BUT INDEED IT HAS BEEN QUITE UNINTENTIONAL ON MY SIDE I NEVER HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF IT PRAY UNDECEIVE HIM AS SOON AS YOU CAN AND TELL HIM I BEG HIS PARDON THAT IS
YET NO ENDEAVOURS SHALL BE WANTING ON OUR SIDE TO MAKE NORTHANGER ABBEY NOT WHOLLY DISAGREEABLE NORTHANGER ABBEY THESE WERE THRILLING WORDS AND WOUND UP CATHERINE'S FEELINGS TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF ECSTASY
HOWEVER IT IS NOT WORTH ARGUING ABOUT FOR WHATEVER MIGHT PASS ON HIS SIDE YOU MUST BE CONVINCED BY MY HAVING NO RECOLLECTION OF IT THAT I NEVER THOUGHT NOR EXPECTED NOR WISHED FOR ANYTHING OF THE KIND FROM HIM
THE VERY CARRIAGE IS ORDERED AND WILL BE HERE AT SEVEN O'CLOCK AND NO SERVANT WILL BE OFFERED YOU CATHERINE SAT DOWN BREATHLESS AND SPEECHLESS I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY SENSES WHEN I HEARD IT
AND THE DISTRESS IN WHICH SHE MUST HAVE BEEN THEREBY INVOLVED FILLING THE MINDS OF BOTH SCARCELY ANOTHER WORD WAS SAID BY EITHER DURING THE TIME OF THEIR REMAINING TOGETHER SHORT HOWEVER WAS THAT TIME THE CARRIAGE WAS SOON ANNOUNCED TO BE READY
MORE ENCOURAGEMENT THAN ONE WISHES TO STAND BY BUT YOU MAY BE ASSURED THAT I AM THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD TO JUDGE YOU SEVERELY ALL THOSE THINGS SHOULD BE ALLOWED FOR IN YOUTH AND HIGH SPIRITS WHAT ONE MEANS ONE DAY YOU KNOW ONE MAY NOT MEAN THE NEXT
HE APPROACHED IMMEDIATELY AND TOOK THE SEAT TO WHICH HER MOVEMENTS INVITED HIM HIS FIRST ADDRESS MADE CATHERINE START THOUGH SPOKEN LOW SHE COULD DISTINGUISH WHAT
HER FEELINGS HER PREFERENCES HAD EACH KNOWN THE HAPPINESS OF A RETURN WHEREVER SHE FELT ATTACHMENT SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO CREATE IT THE AFFECTION OF ISABELLA WAS TO BE SECURED TO HER IN A SISTER THE TILNEYS
EVEN OF DECENT CIVILITY DEAR DEAR CATHERINE IN BEING THE BEARER OF SUCH A MESSAGE I SEEM GUILTY MYSELF OF ALL ITS INSULT YET
MAY I CONGRATULATE YOU ON BEING SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR APPLICATION TO YOUR FAIR FRIEND I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO MAKE THE REQUEST SIR AS YOU CAME IN WELL PROCEED BY ALL MEANS I KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR HEART IS IN IT
WE MAY EXPECT PHILOSOPHY FROM ALL THE WORLD MISS TILNEY WAS EARNEST THOUGH GENTLE IN HER SECONDARY CIVILITIES AND THE AFFAIR BECAME IN A FEW MINUTES AS NEARLY SETTLED AS THIS NECESSARY REFERENCE TO FULLERTON WOULD ALLOW
SHE HAD BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED OF BEING ARCH THOUGHT THE PRESENT A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR BEING REALLY SO AND THEREFORE GAILY SAID DO NOT BE UNEASY ISABELLA JAMES WILL SOON BE HERE PSHA MY DEAR CREATURE SHE REPLIED DO NOT THINK
SHE ROSE UP AND SAYING SHE SHOULD JOIN MISSUS ALLEN PROPOSED THEIR WALKING BUT FOR THIS ISABELLA SHOWED NO INCLINATION SHE WAS SO AMAZINGLY TIRED AND IT WAS SO ODIOUS TO PARADE ABOUT THE PUMP ROOM AND IF SHE MOVED FROM HER SEAT SHE SHOULD MISS HER SISTERS
WERE FELT AND CONSIDERED WITHOUT THE SMALLEST EMOTION AND THOUGH THE WIND WAS HIGH AND OFTEN PRODUCED STRANGE AND SUDDEN NOISES THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE SHE HEARD IT ALL AS SHE LAY AWAKE HOUR AFTER HOUR WITHOUT CURIOSITY OR TERROR
I WOULD NOT FOR ALL THE WORLD BE THE MEANS OF HURRYING YOU INTO AN ENGAGEMENT BEFORE YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT I DO NOT THINK ANYTHING WOULD JUSTIFY ME IN WISHING YOU TO SACRIFICE ALL YOUR HAPPINESS MERELY TO OBLIGE MY BROTHER
AND CATHERINE INSTANTLY RISING A LONG AND AFFECTIONATE EMBRACE SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF LANGUAGE IN BIDDING EACH OTHER ADIEU AND AS THEY ENTERED THE HALL UNABLE TO LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT SOME MENTION OF ONE WHOSE NAME HAD NOT YET BEEN SPOKEN BY EITHER
TURNED FROM THE HOUSE AND IN SUCH A WAY
OR ALLOWING HER EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF CHOICE AS TO THE TIME OR MODE OF HER TRAVELLING OF TWO DAYS THE EARLIEST FIXED ON AND OF THAT ALMOST THE EARLIEST HOUR AS IF RESOLVED TO HAVE HER GONE BEFORE HE WAS STIRRING IN THE MORNING
CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE OPINIONS ALTER BUT MY OPINION OF YOUR BROTHER NEVER DID ALTER IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME YOU ARE DESCRIBING WHAT NEVER HAPPENED MY DEAREST CATHERINE CONTINUED THE OTHER WITHOUT AT ALL LISTENING TO HER
MANY WERE THE INQUIRIES SHE WAS EAGER TO MAKE OF MISS TILNEY BUT SO ACTIVE WERE HER THOUGHTS THAT WHEN THESE INQUIRIES WERE ANSWERED SHE WAS HARDLY MORE ASSURED THAN BEFORE
AND AN APPREHENSION OF NOT BEING EQUALLY BELOVED BY THE OTHER SHE WOULD AT EACH MOMENT OF EACH DAY HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY BUT SHE WAS NOW IN THE FOURTH WEEK OF HER VISIT BEFORE THE GENERAL CAME HOME
THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME MY HEART INDEED WHAT CAN YOU HAVE TO DO WITH HEARTS YOU MEN HAVE NONE OF YOU ANY HEARTS IF WE HAVE NOT HEARTS WE HAVE EYES AND THEY GIVE US TORMENT ENOUGH
SINCE THAT IS THE CASE I AM SURE I SHALL NOT TEASE YOU ANY FURTHER
PROPOSE GOING AWAY AND BE GUIDED IN HER CONDUCT BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HER PROPOSAL MIGHT BE TAKEN AWARE THAT IF SHE GAVE HERSELF MUCH TIME SHE MIGHT FEEL IT DIFFICULT TO BRING FORWARD SO UNPLEASANT A SUBJECT
TO YOUR FAMILY TO THE WORLD WERE YOUR FRIENDS THE ALLENS STILL IN BATH YOU MIGHT GO TO THEM WITH COMPARATIVE EASE A FEW HOURS WOULD TAKE YOU THERE BUT A JOURNEY OF SEVENTY MILES TO BE TAKEN POST BY YOU AT YOUR AGE ALONE UNATTENDED
AND BELIEVING SO FAR HER DOUBTS AND ANXIETIES WERE MERELY SPORTIVE IRRITATIONS HENRY WAS NOT ABLE TO OBEY HIS FATHER'S INJUNCTION OF REMAINING WHOLLY AT NORTHANGER IN ATTENDANCE ON THE LADIES DURING HIS ABSENCE IN LONDON
TO START FORTH HER OBLIGATION OF GOING AWAY VERY SOON ELEANOR LOOKED AND DECLARED HERSELF MUCH CONCERNED SHE HAD HOPED FOR THE PLEASURE OF HER COMPANY FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME HAD BEEN MISLED PERHAPS BY HER WISHES
THERE COULD BE NO DANGER OF IT AND AS LONG AS ALL MENTION OF BATH SCENES WERE AVOIDED SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD BEHAVE TO HIM VERY CIVILLY IN SUCH CONSIDERATIONS TIME PASSED AWAY
ELEANOR BROUGHT NO MESSAGE VERY LITTLE PASSED BETWEEN THEM ON MEETING
WITH ALL THE CHANCES AGAINST HER OF HOUSE HALL PLACE PARK COURT AND COTTAGE NORTHANGER TURNED UP AN ABBEY AND SHE WAS TO BE ITS INHABITANT ITS LONG DAMP PASSAGES ITS NARROW CELLS
THAN YOURSELF MODESTY SUCH AS YOURS BUT NOT FOR THE WORLD WOULD I PAIN IT BY OPEN PRAISE IF YOU CAN BE INDUCED TO HONOUR US WITH A VISIT YOU WILL MAKE US HAPPY BEYOND EXPRESSION TIS TRUE
IT SEEMED AS IF SOMEONE WAS TOUCHING THE VERY DOORWAY AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT A SLIGHT MOTION OF THE LOCK PROVED THAT SOME HAND MUST BE ON IT SHE TREMBLED A LITTLE AT THE IDEA OF ANYONE'S APPROACHING SO CAUTIOUSLY
AND COULD NOT BUT THINK THAT IF MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND WERE AWARE OF THE PLEASURE IT WAS TO HER TO HAVE HER THERE THEY WOULD BE TOO GENEROUS TO HASTEN HER RETURN CATHERINE EXPLAINED OH AS TO THAT
MY POOR HEAD I HAD QUITE FORGOT IT WELL THE THING IS THIS I HAVE JUST HAD A LETTER FROM JOHN YOU CAN GUESS THE CONTENTS NO INDEED I CANNOT MY SWEET LOVE
EVERYTHING HONOURABLE AND SOOTHING EVERY PRESENT ENJOYMENT AND EVERY FUTURE HOPE WAS CONTAINED IN IT
GENERAL TILNEY WAS NOT LESS SANGUINE HAVING ALREADY WAITED ON HER EXCELLENT FRIENDS IN PULTENEY STREET AND OBTAINED THEIR SANCTION OF HIS WISHES SINCE THEY CAN CONSENT TO PART WITH YOU SAID HE
HIS DEPARTURE GAVE CATHERINE THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL CONVICTION THAT A LOSS MAY BE SOMETIMES A GAIN THE HAPPINESS WITH WHICH THEIR TIME NOW PASSED EVERY EMPLOYMENT VOLUNTARY EVERY LAUGH INDULGED
AS TO ANY ATTENTIONS ON HIS SIDE I DO DECLARE UPON MY HONOUR I NEVER WAS SENSIBLE OF THEM FOR A MOMENT EXCEPT JUST HIS ASKING ME TO DANCE THE FIRST DAY OF HIS COMING
THAN MISS TILNEY TOLD HER OF HER FATHER'S HAVING JUST DETERMINED UPON QUITTING BATH BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK HERE WAS A BLOW THE PAST SUSPENSE OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN EASE AND QUIET TO THE PRESENT DISAPPOINTMENT
MY DAUGHTER MISS MORLAND HE CONTINUED WITHOUT LEAVING HIS DAUGHTER TIME TO SPEAK HAS BEEN FORMING A VERY BOLD WISH WE LEAVE BATH AS SHE HAS PERHAPS TOLD YOU ON SATURDAY
YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT I NEVER MEANT TO DECEIVE YOUR BROTHER NEVER SUSPECTED HIM OF LIKING ME TILL THIS MOMENT OH AS TO THAT ANSWERED ISABELLA LAUGHINGLY
THOUGH EVIDENTLY INTENDING TO COME IN
TO THINK THE WORSE OF ME FOR THE PART I AM OBLIGED TO PERFORM I AM INDEED A MOST UNWILLING MESSENGER AFTER WHAT HAS SO LATELY PASSED SO LATELY BEEN SETTLED BETWEEN US HOW JOYFULLY HOW THANKFULLY ON MY SIDE
AND HUNG OVER HER WITH AFFECTIONATE SOLICITUDE MY DEAR CATHERINE YOU MUST NOT YOU MUST NOT INDEED WERE ELEANOR'S FIRST CONNECTED WORDS I AM QUITE WELL THIS KINDNESS DISTRACTS ME
AS LEFT HER ONLY JUST SO MUCH SOLICITUDE AS THE HUMAN MIND CAN NEVER DO COMFORTABLY WITHOUT SHE DID ALMOST ALWAYS
HER ANXIETY HAD FOUNDATION IN FACT HER FEARS IN PROBABILITY AND WITH A MIND SO OCCUPIED IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF ACTUAL AND NATURAL EVIL THE SOLITUDE OF HER SITUATION THE DARKNESS OF HER CHAMBER THE ANTIQUITY OF THE BUILDING
PSHA NONSENSE WAS ISABELLA'S ANSWER IN THE SAME HALF WHISPER WHY DO YOU PUT SUCH THINGS INTO MY HEAD IF I COULD BELIEVE IT MY SPIRIT YOU KNOW IS PRETTY INDEPENDENT
TO APPROVE OF HER THAT AT LEAST THEY SHOULD NOT MEET UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS WOULD MAKE THEIR MEETING MATERIALLY PAINFUL SHE TRUSTED HE WOULD NEVER SPEAK OF MISS THORPE AND INDEED AS HE MUST BY THIS TIME BE ASHAMED OF THE PART HE HAD ACTED
WELL MY DEAR CATHERINE THE CASE SEEMS TO BE THAT YOU ARE DETERMINED AGAINST POOR JOHN IS NOT IT SO
BUT IT IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE I HOPE I EARNESTLY HOPE THAT TO YOUR REAL SAFETY IT WILL BE OF NONE BUT TO EVERYTHING ELSE IT IS OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO COMFORT APPEARANCE PROPRIETY
TILL SHE HAD HER LEAVING THEM WAS NOT EVEN TO BE THOUGHT OF IN HAVING THIS CAUSE OF UNEASINESS SO PLEASANTLY REMOVED THE FORCE OF THE OTHER WAS LIKEWISE WEAKENED THE KINDNESS THE EARNESTNESS OF ELEANOR'S MANNER IN PRESSING HER TO STAY
I TRUST YOU WILL ACQUIT ME FOR YOU MUST HAVE BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN THIS HOUSE TO SEE THAT I AM BUT A NOMINAL MISTRESS OF IT THAT MY REAL POWER IS NOTHING HAVE I OFFENDED THE GENERAL SAID CATHERINE IN A FALTERING VOICE
IN FRIENDS AND FORTUNE CIRCUMSTANCE AND CHANCE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO COOPERATE FOR HER ADVANTAGE BY THE KINDNESS OF HER FIRST FRIENDS THE ALLENS SHE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED INTO SCENES WHERE PLEASURES OF EVERY KIND HAD MET HER
AND A STILL GREATER TO SPEAK WHEN THERE CATHERINE SUPPOSING SOME UNEASINESS ON CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ACCOUNT COULD ONLY EXPRESS HER CONCERN BY SILENT ATTENTION OBLIGED HER TO BE SEATED RUBBED HER TEMPLES WITH LAVENDER WATER
AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PUMP ROOM ONE MORNING BY MISSUS ALLEN'S SIDE WITHOUT ANYTHING TO SAY OR TO HEAR AND SCARCELY HAD SHE FELT A FIVE MINUTES LONGING OF FRIENDSHIP BEFORE THE OBJECT OF IT APPEARED
BUT DID NOT RUIN THEIR COMFORT
THE ENGAGEMENTS OF HIS CURATE AT WOODSTON OBLIGING HIM TO LEAVE THEM ON SATURDAY
AND SHE ONLY WANTED TO KNOW HOW FAR AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED AN APOLOGY MIGHT PROPERLY BE RECEIVED BY HER BUT THE KNOWLEDGE WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS HERE IT WAS NOT CALLED FOR
BUT I MUST NOT TRUST MYSELF WITH WORDS MY DEAR CATHERINE WE ARE TO PART MY FATHER HAS RECOLLECTED AN ENGAGEMENT THAT TAKES OUR WHOLE FAMILY AWAY ON MONDAY WE ARE GOING TO LORD LONGTOWN'S NEAR HEREFORD FOR A FORTNIGHT
AS FAR AS THE THICKNESS OF THE WALLS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO JUDGE THAT A CARRIAGE WAS DRIVING UP TO THE DOOR AND THE NEXT MOMENT CONFIRMED THE IDEA BY THE LOUD NOISE OF THE HOUSE BELL AFTER THE FIRST PERTURBATION OF SURPRISE HAD PASSED AWAY
IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING WHICH SAW THIS BUSINESS ARRANGED SHE VISITED MISS TILNEY AND POURED FORTH HER JOYFUL FEELINGS IT WAS DOOMED TO BE A DAY OF TRIAL NO SOONER HAD SHE EXPRESSED HER DELIGHT IN MISTER ALLEN'S LENGTHENED STAY
PAPA AND MAMMA WERE IN NO HURRY AT ALL AS LONG AS SHE WAS HAPPY THEY WOULD ALWAYS BE SATISFIED THEN WHY MIGHT SHE ASK
WELL IF YOU SAY IT IT WAS SO I DARE SAY BUT FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CANNOT RECOLLECT IT I DO REMEMBER NOW BEING WITH YOU AND SEEING HIM AS WELL AS THE REST BUT THAT WE WERE
I WILL TRUST TO YOUR OWN KINDNESS OF HEART WHEN I AM AT A DISTANCE FROM YOU BUT THIS WITH THE LOOK OF SORROW ACCOMPANYING IT WAS ENOUGH TO MELT CATHERINE'S PRIDE IN A MOMENT AND SHE INSTANTLY SAID OH ELEANOR I WILL WRITE TO YOU INDEED
TILNEY SAYS IT IS ALWAYS THE CASE WITH MINDS OF A CERTAIN STAMP BUT I THOUGHT ISABELLA YOU HAD SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR TO TELL ME OH YES AND SO I HAVE BUT HERE IS A PROOF OF WHAT I WAS SAYING
IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST OLD PLACES IN ENGLAND I UNDERSTAND I SHALL DEPEND UPON A MOST PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF IT YOU SHALL CERTAINLY HAVE THE BEST IN MY POWER TO GIVE BUT WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR ARE YOUR SISTERS COMING
AND STRENGTHENED HER DISTASTE FOR EVERYTHING BEFORE HER
AND CASTLES AND ABBEYS MADE USUALLY THE CHARM OF THOSE REVERIES WHICH HIS IMAGE DID NOT FILL TO SEE AND EXPLORE EITHER THE RAMPARTS AND KEEP OF THE ONE OR THE CLOISTERS OF THE OTHER HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS A DARLING WISH
ISABELLA WAS SILENT MY DEAR FRIEND YOU MUST NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME I CANNOT SUPPOSE YOUR BROTHER CARES SO VERY MUCH ABOUT ME AND YOU KNOW WE SHALL STILL BE SISTERS
FROM WHAT IT COULD ARISE AND WHERE IT WOULD END WERE CONSIDERATIONS OF EQUAL PERPLEXITY AND ALARM THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS DONE SO GROSSLY UNCIVIL HURRYING HER AWAY WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE TO HER OWN CONVENIENCE
MY DEAR ELEANOR CRIED CATHERINE SUPPRESSING HER FEELINGS AS WELL AS SHE COULD DO NOT BE SO DISTRESSED A SECOND ENGAGEMENT MUST GIVE WAY TO A FIRST
YOU KNOW MAKES NO DIFFERENCE I CAN BE READY BY SEVEN LET ME BE CALLED IN TIME
CATHERINE'S SPIRITS HOWEVER WERE TRANQUILLIZED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
AND IT WAS BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE LEFT BATH THAT YOU GAVE HIM THE MOST POSITIVE ENCOURAGEMENT HE SAYS SO IN THIS LETTER SAYS THAT HE AS GOOD AS MADE YOU AN OFFER
AND THEN TILL I CAN ASK FOR YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AS I OUGHT TO DO I WILL NOT EXPECT MORE DIRECT TO ME AT LORD LONGTOWN'S AND I MUST ASK IT UNDER COVER TO ALICE NO ELEANOR
IN A GOOD HEAVEN WHAT CAN BE THE MATTER IT WAS QUICKLY DECIDED BY ELEANOR TO BE HER ELDEST BROTHER WHOSE ARRIVAL WAS OFTEN AS SUDDEN IF NOT QUITE SO UNSEASONABLE AND ACCORDINGLY SHE HURRIED DOWN TO WELCOME HIM
SHE WAS EXPECTING HER SISTERS EVERY MOMENT SO THAT HER DEAREST CATHERINE MUST EXCUSE HER AND MUST SIT QUIETLY DOWN AGAIN BUT CATHERINE COULD BE STUBBORN TOO AND MISSUS ALLEN JUST THEN COMING UP TO PROPOSE THEIR RETURNING HOME
HEAVILY PASSED THE NIGHT SLEEP OR REPOSE THAT DESERVED THE NAME OF SLEEP WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION THAT ROOM IN WHICH HER DISTURBED IMAGINATION HAD TORMENTED HER ON HER FIRST ARRIVAL
AND FEW AND TRIVIAL WERE THE SENTENCES EXCHANGED WHILE THEY REMAINED UPSTAIRS CATHERINE IN BUSY AGITATION COMPLETING HER DRESS AND ELEANOR WITH MORE GOODWILL THAN EXPERIENCE INTENT UPON FILLING THE TRUNK WHEN EVERYTHING WAS DONE THEY LEFT THE ROOM
CATHERINE'S COUNTENANCE FELL AND IN A VOICE OF MOST SINCERE CONCERN SHE ECHOED MISS TILNEY'S CONCLUDING WORDS BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK
AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST THIS ROOF WAS TO BE THE ROOF OF AN ABBEY HER PASSION FOR ANCIENT EDIFICES WAS NEXT IN DEGREE TO HER PASSION FOR HENRY TILNEY
PERHAPS SAID MISS TILNEY IN AN EMBARRASSED MANNER YOU WOULD BE SO GOOD IT WOULD MAKE ME VERY HAPPY IF THE ENTRANCE OF HER FATHER PUT A STOP TO THE CIVILITY
SO SOON AND SO SUDDENLY TOO BUT I AM NOT OFFENDED INDEED I AM NOT I CAN FINISH MY VISIT HERE YOU KNOW AT ANY TIME OR I HOPE YOU WILL COME TO ME CAN YOU WHEN YOU RETURN FROM THIS LORD'S COME TO FULLERTON
WHICH COMMANDED A TOLERABLE VIEW OF EVERYBODY ENTERING AT EITHER IT IS SO OUT OF THE WAY CATHERINE OBSERVING THAT ISABELLA'S EYES WERE CONTINUALLY BENT TOWARDS ONE DOOR OR THE OTHER AS IN EAGER EXPECTATION AND REMEMBERING HOW OFTEN
I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO MAKE THE REQUEST THOUGH
THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME CONCILIATORY MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL OCCURRED TO HER AS HIS DAUGHTER APPEARED
THE FOURTH WEEK WOULD BE TURNED AND PERHAPS IT MIGHT SEEM AN INTRUSION IF SHE STAYED MUCH LONGER THIS WAS A PAINFUL CONSIDERATION WHENEVER IT OCCURRED AND EAGER TO GET RID OF SUCH A WEIGHT ON HER MIND SHE VERY SOON RESOLVED TO SPEAK TO ELEANOR ABOUT IT AT ONCE
SHE PAUSED A MOMENT AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS JUST MADE IT INTELLIGIBLE THAT SHE LEFT HER KIND REMEMBRANCE FOR HER ABSENT FRIEND
BECAUSE HE IS MY BROTHER AND WHO PERHAPS AFTER ALL YOU KNOW MIGHT BE JUST AS HAPPY WITHOUT YOU FOR PEOPLE SELDOM KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD BE AT YOUNG MEN ESPECIALLY THEY ARE SO AMAZINGLY CHANGEABLE AND INCONSTANT
AND MAMMA'S APPROBATION WAS EAGERLY GIVEN
NOW LEFT HER WITH I SHALL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING CATHERINE'S SWELLING HEART NEEDED RELIEF IN ELEANOR'S PRESENCE FRIENDSHIP AND PRIDE HAD EQUALLY RESTRAINED HER TEARS BUT NO SOONER WAS SHE GONE THAN THEY BURST FORTH IN TORRENTS
FOR ONE LETTER AT ALL RISKS ALL HAZARDS I MUST ENTREAT
WHAT CAN HE WRITE ABOUT BUT YOURSELF YOU KNOW HE IS OVER HEAD AND EARS IN LOVE WITH YOU WITH ME DEAR ISABELLA NAY MY SWEETEST CATHERINE THIS IS BEING QUITE ABSURD
BUT I CONFESS AS SOON AS I READ HIS LETTER I THOUGHT IT A VERY FOOLISH IMPRUDENT BUSINESS AND NOT LIKELY TO PROMOTE THE GOOD OF EITHER FOR WHAT WERE YOU TO LIVE UPON SUPPOSING YOU CAME TOGETHER YOU HAVE BOTH OF YOU SOMETHING TO BE SURE
STRIKING AT THAT INSTANT ON HER MIND WITH PECULIAR FORCE
THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF IT SHOULD BE SO MEEKLY BORNE THE POWER OF EARLY HABIT ONLY COULD ACCOUNT FOR IT A DISTINCTION TO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BORN GAVE NO PRIDE THEIR SUPERIORITY OF ABODE WAS NO MORE TO THEM THAN THEIR SUPERIORITY OF PERSON
AND TURNING AS PALE AS HER FRIEND SHE EXCLAIMED TIS A MESSENGER FROM WOODSTON YOU ARE MISTAKEN INDEED RETURNED ELEANOR LOOKING AT HER MOST COMPASSIONATELY IT IS NO ONE FROM WOODSTON IT IS MY FATHER HIMSELF
I COULD NOT HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD A THING OF THAT KIND YOU KNOW
SHE WISHED ISABELLA HAD TALKED MORE LIKE HER USUAL SELF AND NOT SO MUCH ABOUT MONEY AND HAD NOT LOOKED SO WELL PLEASED AT THE SIGHT OF CAPTAIN TILNEY HOW STRANGE THAT SHE SHOULD NOT PERCEIVE HIS ADMIRATION
A LETTER FROM MY STEWARD TELLS ME THAT MY PRESENCE IS WANTED AT HOME AND BEING DISAPPOINTED IN MY HOPE OF SEEING THE MARQUIS OF LONGTOWN AND GENERAL COURTENEY HERE SOME OF MY VERY OLD FRIENDS THERE IS NOTHING TO DETAIN ME LONGER IN BATH
HER VOICE FALTERED AND HER EYES WERE TURNED TO THE GROUND AS SHE MENTIONED HIS NAME HIS UNLOOKED FOR RETURN WAS ENOUGH IN ITSELF TO MAKE CATHERINE'S HEART SINK
ME SUCH A SIMPLETON AS TO BE ALWAYS WANTING TO CONFINE HIM TO MY ELBOW IT WOULD BE HIDEOUS TO BE ALWAYS TOGETHER WE SHOULD BE THE JEST OF THE PLACE AND SO YOU ARE GOING TO NORTHANGER I AM AMAZINGLY GLAD OF IT
WE CAN OFFER YOU NOTHING LIKE THE GAIETIES OF THIS LIVELY PLACE WE CAN TEMPT YOU NEITHER BY AMUSEMENT NOR SPLENDOUR FOR OUR MODE OF LIVING AS YOU SEE IS PLAIN AND UNPRETENDING
FOUND THEMSELVES SO WELL SUFFICIENT FOR THE TIME TO THEMSELVES THAT IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK RATHER A LATE HOUR AT THE ABBEY BEFORE THEY QUITTED THE SUPPER ROOM ON THE DAY OF HENRY'S DEPARTURE THEY HAD JUST REACHED THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS WHEN IT SEEMED
BUT HOW CAN I TELL YOU TOMORROW MORNING IS FIXED FOR YOUR LEAVING US
AND HIS ASSERTION OF THE OFFER AND OF HER ENCOURAGEMENT CONVINCED HER THAT HIS MISTAKES COULD SOMETIMES BE VERY EGREGIOUS IN VANITY THEREFORE
BUT RESOLVING NOT TO BE AGAIN OVERCOME BY TRIVIAL APPEARANCES OF ALARM OR MISLED BY A RAISED IMAGINATION SHE STEPPED QUIETLY FORWARD AND OPENED THE DOOR ELEANOR AND ONLY ELEANOR STOOD THERE
IT PROVED TO BE EXACTLY THE CASE CATHERINE HAD NEVER THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT TILL THAT MOMENT BUT UPON EXAMINING HER PURSE WAS CONVINCED THAT BUT FOR THIS KINDNESS OF HER FRIEND SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TURNED FROM THE HOUSE WITHOUT EVEN THE MEANS OF GETTING HOME
I CANNOT BEAR IT I COME TO YOU ON SUCH AN ERRAND ERRAND TO ME HOW SHALL I TELL YOU OH HOW SHALL I TELL YOU A NEW IDEA NOW DARTED INTO CATHERINE'S MIND
WHAT I SAY IS WHY SHOULD A BROTHER'S HAPPINESS BE DEARER TO ME THAN A FRIEND'S YOU KNOW I CARRY MY NOTIONS OF FRIENDSHIP PRETTY HIGH
WAS AN EVIL WHICH NOTHING COULD COUNTERBALANCE HER WHOLE HAPPINESS SEEMED AT STAKE WHILE THE AFFAIR WAS IN SUSPENSE
TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THAT IF YOU ARE IN TOO GREAT A HURRY YOU WILL CERTAINLY LIVE TO REPENT IT
WHO COULD SAY WHEN THEY MIGHT MEET AGAIN AND ALL THIS BY SUCH A MAN AS GENERAL TILNEY SO POLITE SO WELL BRED AND HERETOFORE SO PARTICULARLY FOND OF HER IT WAS AS INCOMPREHENSIBLE AS IT WAS MORTIFYING AND GRIEVOUS
MADE BUT A SMALL PART OF CATHERINE'S SPECULATION ONCE OR TWICE INDEED SINCE JAMES'S ENGAGEMENT HAD TAUGHT HER WHAT COULD BE DONE SHE HAD GOT SO FAR AS TO INDULGE IN A SECRET PERHAPS
WITH A MIND THUS FULL OF HAPPINESS CATHERINE WAS HARDLY AWARE THAT TWO OR THREE DAYS HAD PASSED AWAY WITHOUT HER SEEING ISABELLA FOR MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES TOGETHER SHE BEGAN FIRST TO BE SENSIBLE OF THIS AND TO SIGH FOR HER CONVERSATION
AND COULD WE CARRY OUR SELFISH POINT WITH YOU WE SHOULD LEAVE IT WITHOUT A SINGLE REGRET CAN YOU IN SHORT BE PREVAILED ON TO QUIT THIS SCENE OF PUBLIC TRIUMPH AND OBLIGE YOUR FRIEND ELEANOR WITH YOUR COMPANY IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE
HIS LOSS WAS NOT NOW WHAT IT HAD BEEN WHILE THE GENERAL WAS AT HOME
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN IN THE PROPEREST WAY I WOULD NOT SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF A BROTHER OF YOURS ISABELLA I AM SURE BUT YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT IF I COULD THINK OF ONE MAN MORE THAN ANOTHER
SOON AFTER SIX ELEANOR ENTERED HER ROOM EAGER TO SHOW ATTENTION OR GIVE ASSISTANCE WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE BUT VERY LITTLE REMAINED TO BE DONE
THEY BY WHOM ABOVE ALL SHE DESIRED TO BE FAVOURABLY THOUGHT OF OUTSTRIPPED EVEN HER WISHES IN THE FLATTERING MEASURES BY WHICH THEIR INTIMACY WAS TO BE CONTINUED SHE WAS TO BE THEIR CHOSEN VISITOR
HER GRATEFUL AND GRATIFIED HEART COULD HARDLY RESTRAIN ITS EXPRESSIONS WITHIN THE LANGUAGE OF TOLERABLE CALMNESS TO RECEIVE SO FLATTERING AN INVITATION TO HAVE HER COMPANY SO WARMLY SOLICITED
THE COMPLIMENT OF JOHN THORPE'S AFFECTION DID NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR THIS THOUGHTLESSNESS IN HIS SISTER SHE WAS ALMOST AS FAR FROM BELIEVING AS FROM WISHING IT TO BE SINCERE FOR SHE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THAT HE COULD MISTAKE
WHO HAD JUST ARRIVED AND WAS LEANING ON THE ARM OF SIGNOR TORLONIA THE DUKE'S BROTHER I THINK ON THE CONTRARY
HE WENT UP TO HIM BUT TO HIS EXTREME ASTONISHMENT THE STRANGER FIRST ADDRESSED HIM WHAT WANTS YOUR EXCELLENCY OF ME INQUIRED THE MAN RETREATING A STEP OR TWO AS IF TO KEEP ON HIS GUARD
WHO WAS ON THE STEPS OF THE CHURCH OF SAN GIACOMO WHAT EXCLAIMED FRANZ THE PEASANT GIRL WHO SNATCHED HIS MOCOLETTO FROM HIM WAS A LAD OF FIFTEEN REPLIED PEPPINO BUT IT WAS NO DISGRACE TO YOUR FRIEND TO HAVE BEEN DECEIVED
THEIR RETURN WAS QUITE AN EVENT BUT AS THEY ENTERED TOGETHER ALL UNEASINESS ON ALBERT'S ACCOUNT CEASED INSTANTLY
BEPPO GOT IN INVITING THE FRENCHMAN TO FOLLOW HIM AND HE DID NOT WAIT TO BE ASKED TWICE HE GALLANTLY OFFERED THE RIGHT HAND SEAT TO BEPPO AND SAT BY HIM BEPPO TOLD HIM HE WAS GOING TO TAKE HIM TO A VILLA A LEAGUE FROM ROME
WHO WERE WAITING FOR HIM IN THE CATACOMBS OF SAINT SEBASTIAN
IT BE TO GO TO A BALL OUR FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF COUNTESS WHOM I LEFT IN PURSUIT OF HIS UNKNOWN ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK THIS EVENING SAID FRANZ AND WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN SINCE AND DON'T YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS NOT AT ALL
HAVE A EUROPEAN CELEBRITY FRANZ AND ALBERT HAD BROUGHT TO ROME LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION TO THEM AND THEIR FIRST QUESTION ON HIS ARRIVAL WAS TO INQUIRE THE WHEREABOUTS OF HIS TRAVELLING COMPANION FRANZ REPLIED THAT HE HAD LEFT HIM AT THE MOMENT
HE SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIM IN A LOW TONE AND THEN HE LIKE THE FIRST SALUTED THE NOCTURNAL VISITORS MAKING A SIGN THAT THEY MIGHT PROCEED BEHIND THE SENTINEL WAS A STAIRCASE WITH TWENTY STEPS FRANZ AND THE COUNT DESCENDED THESE AND FOUND THEMSELVES IN A MORTUARY CHAMBER
YOU ARE RIGHT YOUR EXCELLENCY HE SAID THIS MUST BE ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO IT WHY THAT I SHOULD THINK IT VERY AMUSING REPLIED FRANZ IF IT HAD HAPPENED TO ANY ONE BUT POOR ALBERT AND IN TRUTH IF YOU HAD NOT FOUND ME HERE SAID THE COUNT
THE STREET WAS SAFER FOR HIM ALBERT THEN HAD FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE FAMOUS BANDIT CHIEF IN WHOSE EXISTENCE HE HAD FOR SO LONG A TIME REFUSED TO BELIEVE THERE WAS NO TIME TO LOSE HE HASTENED TO OPEN THE SECRETARY
I WAS NEVER IN THEM BUT I HAVE OFTEN RESOLVED TO VISIT THEM
AND TO WHOM I DESIRED TO PROVE THAT LUIGI VAMPA WAS A MAN OF HIS WORD COME YOUR EXCELLENCY THE COUNT ADDED
I DO NOT SAY MORE RELYING ON YOU AS YOU MAY RELY ON ME YOUR FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF P S I NOW BELIEVE IN ITALIAN BANDITTI BELOW THESE LINES WERE WRITTEN IN A STRANGE HAND THE FOLLOWING IN ITALIAN
TO WARN HIM TO BE SILENT AND ASCENDING THE THREE STEPS WHICH LED TO THE CORRIDOR OF THE COLUMBARIUM ENTERED THE CHAMBER BY THE MIDDLE ARCADE
WERE TO BE SEEN TWENTY BRIGANDS OR MORE EACH HAVING HIS CARBINE WITHIN REACH
ANY MONEY IT IS USELESS WHERE IS THE MAN WHO BROUGHT THE LETTER IN THE STREET HE AWAITS THE ANSWER YES I MUST LEARN WHERE WE ARE GOING I WILL SUMMON HIM HITHER IT IS USELESS HE WOULD NOT COME UP TO YOUR APARTMENTS PERHAPS
EXCLAIMED FRANZ YES AND WHO IS THE MAN I DO NOT KNOW WHY DID HE NOT BRING IT TO ME HERE THE MESSENGER DID NOT SAY AND WHERE IS THE MESSENGER HE WENT AWAY DIRECTLY HE SAW ME ENTER THE BALL ROOM TO FIND YOU OH
THAN THAT OF FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU AND THE WOMEN OF FALLING ILL OF JEALOUSY AT SEEING YOU SO LOVELY I MEANT PERSONS WHO WERE OUT IN THE STREETS OF ROME AH ASKED THE COUNTESS WHO IS OUT IN THE STREETS OF ROME AT THIS HOUR UNLESS
AS IN THIS MOMENT IT SEEMED AS THOUGH ROME UNDER THE MAGIC BREATH OF SOME DEMON OF THE NIGHT HAD SUDDENLY CHANGED INTO A VAST TOMB BY A CHANCE WHICH ADDED YET MORE TO THE INTENSITY OF THE DARKNESS THE MOON WHICH WAS ON THE WANE
ANYTHING FRANZ RESOLVED TO WAIT FOR ALBERT AS LATE AS POSSIBLE
AND REMOVE THE PISTOLS WHICH ARE IN THE HOLSTERS YOU NEED NOT AWAKEN THE COACHMAN ALI WILL DRIVE
PLENTY OF OTHERS AND BEPPO LED HIM OUTSIDE THE WALLS SAID THE COUNT
ALBERT LOOKED AROUND AND PERCEIVED FRANZ WHAT SAID HE IS IT YOU MY DEAR FRANZ WHOSE DEVOTION AND FRIENDSHIP ARE THUS DISPLAYED NO NOT I REPLIED FRANZ BUT OUR NEIGHBOR THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO OH MY DEAR COUNT
FRANZ IMAGINED THAT HE SAW SOMETHING LIKE A SENTINEL
LUIGI VAMPA IF BY SIX IN THE MORNING THE FOUR THOUSAND PIASTRES ARE NOT IN MY HANDS BY SEVEN O'CLOCK THE COUNT ALBERT WILL HAVE CEASED TO LIVE THIS SECOND SIGNATURE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING TO FRANZ
YOU ARE DECIDEDLY RIGHT AND WE MAY REACH THE PALAZZO BY TWO O'CLOCK SIGNOR LUIGI CONTINUED ALBERT
FRANZ FELT A SHUDDER RUN THROUGH HIS VEINS
AT THE MISTAKE HE HAS COMMITTED FRANZ APPROACHED THE CHIEF ADVANCING SEVERAL STEPS TO MEET HIM WELCOME AMONG US YOUR EXCELLENCY HE SAID TO HIM YOU HEARD WHAT THE COUNT JUST SAID AND ALSO MY REPLY LET ME ADD THAT I WOULD NOT FOR THE FOUR THOUSAND PIASTRES
TO THEM BOTH TO MAKE UP THE SUM THAT ALBERT REQUIRED TRUE HE MIGHT IN SUCH A CASE RELY ON THE KINDNESS OF SIGNOR TORLONIA HE WAS THEREFORE ABOUT TO RETURN TO THE PALAZZO BRACCIANO WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME WHEN SUDDENLY A LUMINOUS IDEA CROSSED HIS MIND
HE BOWED AND NOW YOUR EXCELLENCY ADDED HE ALLOW ME TO REPEAT MY APOLOGIES AND I HOPE YOU WILL NOT ENTERTAIN ANY RESENTMENT AT WHAT HAS OCCURRED NO MY DEAR VAMPA REPLIED THE COUNT BESIDES YOU COMPENSATE FOR YOUR MISTAKES IN SO
WE SHALL BE THERE HE THEN TOOK PEPPINO ASIDE GAVE HIM AN ORDER IN A LOW VOICE AND PEPPINO WENT AWAY TAKING WITH HIM A TORCH BROUGHT WITH THEM IN THE CARRIAGE FIVE MINUTES ELAPSED DURING WHICH FRANZ SAW THE SHEPHERD
WELL WELL SAID HE DID YOU SEE THE POSTSCRIPT I DID INDEED SE ALLE SEI DELLA MATTINA LE QUATTRO MILE PIASTRE NON SONO NELLE MIE MANI
NONE SIR REPLIED THE BANDIT YOU ARE AS FREE AS AIR
SAID THE CAPTAIN THAT IS THE LEAST HONOR THAT I CAN RENDER TO YOUR EXCELLENCY AND TAKING THE LIGHTED TORCH FROM THE HANDS OF THE HERDSMAN HE PRECEDED HIS GUESTS NOT AS A SERVANT WHO PERFORMS AN ACT OF CIVILITY BUT LIKE A KING WHO PRECEDES AMBASSADORS ON REACHING THE DOOR
AS HE LIVED AT FLORENCE AND HAD ONLY COME TO ROME TO PASS SEVEN OR EIGHT DAYS HE HAD BROUGHT BUT A HUNDRED LOUIS AND OF THESE HE HAD NOT MORE THAN FIFTY LEFT THUS SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED PIASTRES WERE WANTING
AND YET I REPEAT TO YOU YOU HAVE CARRIED HIM OFF AND CONVEYED HIM HITHER AND ADDED THE COUNT TAKING THE LETTER FROM HIS POCKET YOU HAVE SET A RANSOM ON HIM AS IF HE WERE AN UTTER STRANGER WHY DID YOU NOT TELL ME ALL THIS
BUT HE WILL NOT MAKE ANY DIFFICULTY AT ENTERING MINE
COME IN YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID VAMPA THE COUNT AND FRANZ ASCENDED SEVEN OR EIGHT STEPS AFTER THE CHIEF WHO DREW BACK A BOLT AND OPENED A DOOR THEN BY THE GLEAM OF A LAMP SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH LIGHTED THE COLUMBARIUM ALBERT WAS TO BE SEEN WRAPPED UP IN A CLOAK
WHO PRESENTED HIMSELF TWO OR THREE TIMES TO INQUIRE
IS HARDLY TEN MINUTES WALK FROM THE HOTEL DE LONDRES AS HE CAME NEAR THE HOTEL FRANZ SAW A MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS THE MESSENGER FROM ALBERT THE MAN WAS WRAPPED UP IN A LARGE CLOAK
NO NOT PRECISELY HOWEVER I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING VERY LIKE A RENDEZVOUS DIAVOLO SAID THE DUKE THIS IS A BAD DAY OR RATHER A BAD NIGHT TO BE OUT LATE IS IT NOT COUNTESS THESE WORDS WERE ADDRESSED TO THE COUNTESS G
IT WAS HE WHO DROVE DISGUISED AS THE COACHMAN REPLIED PEPPINO WELL SAID THE COUNT WELL THEN THE FRENCHMAN TOOK OFF HIS MASK
A SERIOUS MATTER SAID THE COUNT LOOKING AT FRANZ WITH THE EARNESTNESS USUAL TO HIM AND WHAT MAY IT BE ARE WE ALONE YES REPLIED THE COUNT GOING TO THE DOOR AND RETURNING FRANZ GAVE HIM ALBERT'S LETTER READ THAT HE SAID THE COUNT READ IT
PEPPINO GLIDED FIRST INTO THIS CREVICE AFTER THEY GOT ALONG A FEW PACES THE PASSAGE WIDENED PEPPINO PASSED LIGHTED HIS TORCH AND TURNED TO SEE IF THEY CAME AFTER HIM THE COUNT FIRST REACHED AN OPEN SPACE AND FRANZ FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY
AND HE LIGHTED HIS CIGAR AT VAMPA'S TORCH NOW MY DEAR COUNT HE SAID LET US ON WITH ALL THE SPEED WE MAY I AM ENORMOUSLY ANXIOUS TO FINISH MY NIGHT AT THE DUKE OF BRACCIANO'S THEY FOUND THE CARRIAGE WHERE THEY HAD LEFT IT
THEN IT IS TO YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT THIS LETTER IS ADDRESSED IS THERE ANY ANSWER INQUIRED FRANZ TAKING THE LETTER FROM HIM YES YOUR FRIEND AT LEAST HOPES SO COME UP STAIRS WITH ME AND I WILL GIVE IT TO YOU
AND THE CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE DOOR THE COUNT TOOK OUT HIS WATCH HALF PAST TWELVE HE SAID
YOUR PARDON YOUR EXCELLENCY BUT I WAS SO FAR FROM EXPECTING THE HONOR OF A VISIT THAT I DID NOT REALLY RECOGNIZE YOU IT SEEMS THAT YOUR MEMORY IS EQUALLY SHORT IN EVERYTHING VAMPA SAID THE COUNT AND THAT NOT ONLY DO YOU FORGET PEOPLE'S FACES
AND WHISTLED IN A PECULIAR MANNER THE MAN IN THE MANTLE QUITTED THE WALL
IS ONE OF MY FRIENDS YOU ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU THIS TITLE CONTINUED THE COUNT IN FRENCH IT IS NECESSARY TO EXCITE THIS MAN'S CONFIDENCE YOU CAN SPEAK BEFORE ME SAID FRANZ I AM A FRIEND OF THE COUNT'S GOOD RETURNED PEPPINO I
HERE WAS ONE WHOSE GAY TEMPERAMENT WAS NOT FOR A MOMENT ALTERED AS FOR FRANZ HE WAS ENCHANTED AT THE WAY IN WHICH ALBERT HAD SUSTAINED THE NATIONAL HONOR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BANDIT MY DEAR ALBERT HE SAID IF YOU WILL MAKE HASTE
IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME THE OPENING OF THE CATACOMBS IS CLOSE AT HAND GO ON THEN REPLIED THE COUNT THEY CAME TO AN OPENING BEHIND A CLUMP OF BUSHES AND IN THE MIDST OF A PILE OF ROCKS BY WHICH A MAN COULD SCARCELY PASS
YES YOUR EXCELLENCY HE HAS THIS MOMENT RETURNED IS HE IN BED I SHOULD SAY NO THEN RING AT HIS DOOR
AND SIGNED BY ALBERT FRANZ READ IT TWICE BEFORE HE COULD COMPREHEND WHAT IT CONTAINED IT WAS THUS WORDED MY DEAR FELLOW THE MOMENT YOU HAVE RECEIVED THIS HAVE THE KINDNESS TO TAKE THE LETTER OF CREDIT FROM MY POCKET BOOK

IN WHICH HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN AN ORDER TO HIS SERVANT THE MESSENGER OBEYED WITHOUT THE LEAST HESITATION BUT RATHER WITH ALACRITY AND MOUNTING THE STEPS AT A BOUND ENTERED THE HOTEL FIVE SECONDS AFTERWARDS HE WAS AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM AH IT IS YOU PEPPINO
FRANZ AND THE COUNT GOT INTO THE CARRIAGE PEPPINO PLACED HIMSELF BESIDE ALI AND THEY SET OFF AT A RAPID PACE ALI HAD RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND WENT DOWN THE CORSO CROSSED THE CAMPO VACCINO
WHO WERE CONCEALED ON THE BANKS OF THE ALMO SURROUNDED THE CARRIAGE THE FRENCHMAN MADE SOME RESISTANCE AND NEARLY STRANGLED BEPPO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST FIVE ARMED MEN AND WAS FORCED TO YIELD THEY MADE HIM GET OUT WALK ALONG THE BANKS OF THE RIVER

CHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN THE CATACOMBS OF SAINT SEBASTIAN IN HIS WHOLE LIFE PERHAPS FRANZ HAD NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED SO SUDDEN AN IMPRESSION SO RAPID A TRANSITION
WHICH THE YOUNG MAN TRAVERSED WERE PLUNGED IN THE DEEPEST OBSCURITY THE DISTANCE WAS SHORT AND AT THE END OF TEN MINUTES HIS CARRIAGE OR RATHER THE COUNT'S STOPPED BEFORE THE HOTEL DE LONDRES
LET US GO ON PEPPINO WILL HAVE WARNED THE SENTRY OF OUR COMING ONE OF THE TWO MEN WAS PEPPINO AND THE OTHER A BANDIT ON THE LOOKOUT FRANZ AND THE COUNT ADVANCED AND THE BANDIT SALUTED THEM YOUR EXCELLENCY SAID PEPPINO ADDRESSING THE COUNT

REPLIED ALBERT WITH PERFECT EASE OF MIND REMEMBER FOR THE FUTURE NAPOLEON'S MAXIM NEVER AWAKEN ME BUT FOR BAD NEWS IF YOU HAD LET ME SLEEP ON I SHOULD HAVE FINISHED MY GALOP AND HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL TO YOU ALL MY LIFE SO THEN
NO MATTER I KNOW IT THE COUNT KNIT HIS BROWS AND REMAINED SILENT AN INSTANT AND IF I WENT TO SEEK VAMPA WOULD YOU ACCOMPANY ME IF MY SOCIETY WOULD NOT BE DISAGREEABLE BE IT SO
THE ROAD WHICH THE CARRIAGE NOW TRAVERSED WAS THE ANCIENT APPIAN WAY AND BORDERED WITH TOMBS FROM TIME TO TIME
FIVE CORRIDORS DIVERGED LIKE THE RAYS OF A STAR AND THE WALLS DUG INTO NICHES WHICH WERE ARRANGED ONE ABOVE THE OTHER IN THE SHAPE OF COFFINS SHOWED THAT THEY WERE AT LAST IN THE CATACOMBS DOWN ONE OF THE CORRIDORS WHOSE EXTENT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE
AS IF HE HAD THE SINGULAR FACULTY OF SEEING IN THE DARK FRANZ HIMSELF HOWEVER SAW HIS WAY MORE PLAINLY IN PROPORTION AS HE WENT ON TOWARDS THE LIGHT
THAT SOMETIMES WHEN I RISE OR AFTER MY DINNER OR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT I RESOLVE ON STARTING FOR SOME PARTICULAR POINT AND AWAY I GO THE COUNT RANG AND A FOOTMAN APPEARED ORDER OUT THE CARRIAGE HE SAID
AND FRANZ AND THE COUNT WERE IN UTTER DARKNESS EXCEPT THAT FIFTY PACES IN ADVANCE OF THEM A REDDISH GLARE MORE EVIDENT SINCE PEPPINO HAD PUT OUT HIS TORCH WAS VISIBLE ALONG THE WALL THEY ADVANCED SILENTLY THE COUNT GUIDING FRANZ
I AM YOUR EXCELLENCY'S NAME
SIGNOR PASTRINI DID AS HE WAS DESIRED AND RETURNING FIVE MINUTES AFTER HE SAID THE COUNT AWAITS YOUR EXCELLENCY FRANZ WENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR AND A SERVANT INTRODUCED HIM TO THE COUNT HE WAS IN A SMALL ROOM WHICH FRANZ HAD NOT YET SEEN
SE ALLE SEI DELLA MATTINA
AND I HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER ME AS UNDER ETERNAL OBLIGATIONS TO YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR THE CARRIAGE
IN A MOMENT ALL THE BANDITS WERE ON THEIR FEET AND TWENTY CARBINES WERE LEVELLED AT THE COUNT WELL SAID HE IN A VOICE PERFECTLY CALM AND NO MUSCLE OF HIS COUNTENANCE DISTURBED WELL MY DEAR VAMPA
THE PASSAGEWAY SLOPED IN A GENTLE DESCENT ENLARGING AS THEY PROCEEDED STILL FRANZ AND THE COUNT WERE COMPELLED TO ADVANCE IN A STOOPING POSTURE AND WERE SCARCELY ABLE TO PROCEED ABREAST OF ONE ANOTHER
WE SHALL YET HAVE TIME TO FINISH THE NIGHT AT TORLONIA'S YOU MAY CONCLUDE YOUR INTERRUPTED GALOP SO THAT YOU WILL OWE NO ILL WILL TO SIGNOR LUIGI WHO HAS INDEED THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE AFFAIR ACTED LIKE A GENTLEMAN
THE COUNT SAID A WORD IN ARABIC TO ALI AND THE HORSES WENT ON AT GREAT SPEED IT WAS JUST TWO O'CLOCK BY ALBERT'S WATCH
RISE AND ANSWER PEPPINO GLANCED ANXIOUSLY AT FRANZ
AND THAT HE HAD LOST SIGHT OF HIM IN THE VIA MACELLO THEN HE HAS NOT RETURNED SAID THE DUKE I WAITED FOR HIM UNTIL THIS HOUR REPLIED FRANZ
SAID ALBERT GAYLY ARRANGING HIS CRAVAT AND WRISTBANDS
YOU HAVE SEEN THE MAN WHO DESIRED TO SPEAK WITH YOU FROM YOUR FRIEND HE ASKED OF FRANZ YES I HAVE SEEN HIM HE REPLIED AND HE HAS HANDED THIS LETTER TO ME LIGHT THE CANDLES IN MY APARTMENT
AT WHICH I HAD FIXED YOUR FRIEND'S RANSOM THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED BUT SAID FRANZ LOOKING ROUND HIM UNEASILY
NO EXCELLENCY AND NEVER SHALL I FORGET IT RETURNED PEPPINO WITH AN ACCENT OF PROFOUND GRATITUDE NEVER THAT IS A LONG TIME
YOUR EXCELLENCY LODGES AT PASTRINI'S HOTEL I DO
REPLIED FRANZ I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT WORK YOU WERE PERUSING WITH SO MUCH ATTENTION AS WE ENTERED CAESAR'S COMMENTARIES SAID THE BANDIT
WHICH HAD REPLACED THE LIGHT AND THE SILENCE WHICH HAD SUCCEEDED THE TURMOIL HAD LEFT IN FRANZ'S MIND A CERTAIN DEPRESSION WHICH WAS NOT FREE FROM UNEASINESS HE THEREFORE DINED VERY SILENTLY IN SPITE OF THE OFFICIOUS ATTENTION OF HIS HOST
TO GO BEFORE FRANZ WITH A LIGHT THE YOUNG MAN HAD FOUND SIGNOR PASTRINI LOOKING VERY MUCH ALARMED AND THIS HAD ONLY MADE HIM THE MORE ANXIOUS TO READ ALBERT'S LETTER AND SO HE WENT INSTANTLY TOWARDS THE WAXLIGHT AND UNFOLDED IT IT WAS WRITTEN
OUT AS ALBERT'S PRISON AND FRANZ AND THE COUNT FOLLOWED HIM WHAT IS THE PRISONER DOING INQUIRED VAMPA OF THE SENTINEL MA FOI CAPTAIN REPLIED THE SENTRY I DO NOT KNOW FOR THE LAST HOUR I HAVE NOT HEARD HIM STIR
REPLIED THE DUKE HERE I THINK IS ONE OF MY SERVANTS WHO IS SEEKING YOU THE DUKE WAS NOT MISTAKEN WHEN HE SAW FRANZ THE SERVANT CAME UP TO HIM YOUR EXCELLENCY HE SAID THE MASTER OF THE HOTEL DE LONDRES
GOING ALONG A NARROW PATH THAT LED OVER THE IRREGULAR AND BROKEN SURFACE OF THE CAMPAGNA AND FINALLY HE DISAPPEARED IN THE MIDST OF THE TALL RED HERBAGE WHICH SEEMED LIKE THE BRISTLING MANE OF AN ENORMOUS LION NOW SAID THE COUNT
CERTAINLY FRANZ ENTERED THE HOTEL ON THE STAIRCASE HE MET SIGNOR PASTRINI WELL SAID THE LANDLORD
BY HEAVENS IF I THOUGHT ONE OF YOU KNEW THAT THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WAS THE FRIEND OF HIS EXCELLENCY I WOULD BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT WITH MY OWN HAND WELL SAID THE COUNT TURNING TOWARDS FRANZ I TOLD YOU THERE WAS SOME MISTAKE IN THIS ARE YOU NOT ALONE
SHOULD BE RESPECTED BY YOU AND HOW HAVE I BROKEN THAT TREATY YOUR EXCELLENCY YOU HAVE THIS EVENING CARRIED OFF AND CONVEYED HITHER THE VICOMTE
HE REMEMBERED THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO FRANZ WAS ABOUT TO RING FOR SIGNOR PASTRINI
THEY WENT ON A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PACES IN THIS WAY AND THEN WERE STOPPED BY WHO COMES THERE AT THE SAME TIME THEY SAW THE REFLECTION OF A TORCH ON A CARBINE BARREL A FRIEND RESPONDED PEPPINO AND ADVANCING ALONE TOWARDS THE SENTRY
ARE NOT YOU THE PERSON WHO BROUGHT ME A LETTER INQUIRED FRANZ
HAVE YOU THE MONEY HE DEMANDS YES ALL BUT EIGHT HUNDRED PIASTRES THE COUNT WENT TO HIS SECRETARY OPENED IT AND PULLING OUT A DRAWER FILLED WITH GOLD SAID TO FRANZ
NON SONO NELLE MIE MANI ALLA SETTE
AND SUDDENLY RETREAT INTO THE DARKNESS ON A SIGNAL FROM PEPPINO A SHORT TIME BEFORE THEY REACHED THE BATHS OF CARACALLA THE CARRIAGE STOPPED PEPPINO OPENED THE DOOR AND THE COUNT AND FRANZ ALIGHTED IN TEN MINUTES SAID THE COUNT TO HIS COMPANION
AND ALBERT FOLLOWED BY FRANZ AND THE COUNT DESCENDED THE STAIRCASE CROSSED THE SQUARE CHAMBER WHERE STOOD ALL THE BANDITS HAT IN HAND PEPPINO SAID THE BRIGAND CHIEF GIVE ME THE TORCH WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO INQUIRED THE COUNT I WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY BACK MYSELF
LUIGI'S HANDS EXCELLENCY THE FRENCHMAN'S CARRIAGE PASSED SEVERAL TIMES THE ONE IN WHICH WAS TERESA THE CHIEF'S MISTRESS YES THE FRENCHMAN THREW HER A BOUQUET TERESA RETURNED IT ALL THIS WITH THE CONSENT OF THE CHIEF WHO WAS IN THE CARRIAGE
DINNER WAS WAITING BUT AS ALBERT HAD TOLD HIM THAT HE SHOULD NOT RETURN SO SOON FRANZ SAT DOWN WITHOUT HIM SIGNOR PASTRINI
AND THE COUNTESS WAS SO MUCH IN UNISON WITH HIS OWN PERSONAL DISQUIETUDE I INFORMED THEM AT THE HOTEL THAT I HAD THE HONOR OF PASSING THE NIGHT HERE DUKE SAID FRANZ AND DESIRED THEM TO COME AND INFORM ME OF HIS RETURN AH
I PREFER WAITING HERE SAID THE MESSENGER WITH A SMILE AND WHY YOUR EXCELLENCY WILL KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE READ THE LETTER
WENT UP THE STRADA SAN GREGORIO AND REACHED THE GATES OF SAINT SEBASTIAN
THAT HE DID NOT HEAR THE NOISE OF HIS FOOTSTEPS WHO COMES THERE CRIED THE SENTINEL WHO WAS LESS ABSTRACTED AND WHO SAW BY THE LAMP LIGHT A SHADOW APPROACHING HIS CHIEF AT THIS CHALLENGE VAMPA ROSE QUICKLY DRAWING AT THE SAME MOMENT A PISTOL FROM HIS GIRDLE
HAS SENT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT A MAN IS WAITING FOR YOU WITH A LETTER
AND FOUND THE POCKET BOOK IN THE DRAWER AND IN IT THE LETTER OF CREDIT THERE WERE IN ALL SIX THOUSAND PIASTRES BUT OF THESE SIX THOUSAND ALBERT HAD ALREADY EXPENDED THREE THOUSAND AS TO FRANZ HE HAD NO LETTER OF CREDIT
THE POSTSCRIPT IS EXPLICIT I THINK THAT IF YOU WOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE OF REFLECTING YOU COULD FIND A WAY OF SIMPLIFYING THE NEGOTIATION SAID FRANZ HOW SO RETURNED THE COUNT WITH SURPRISE IF WE WERE TO GO TOGETHER TO LUIGI VAMPA
IT MIGHT HAVE PROVED A GALLANT ADVENTURE WHICH WOULD HAVE COST YOUR FRIEND DEAR BUT NOW BE ASSURED HIS ALARM WILL BE THE ONLY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCE AND SHALL WE GO AND FIND HIM INQUIRED FRANZ
INQUIRED INTO THE CAUSE OF HIS ABSENCE BUT FRANZ MERELY REPLIED THAT ALBERT HAD RECEIVED ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AN INVITATION WHICH HE HAD ACCEPTED THE SUDDEN EXTINCTION OF THE MOCCOLETTI THE DARKNESS
THREE ARCADES WERE BEFORE THEM AND THE MIDDLE ONE WAS USED AS A DOOR THESE ARCADES OPENED ON ONE SIDE INTO THE CORRIDOR WHERE THE COUNT AND FRANZ WERE
WHO WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN BEFORE A GROTTO WHICH WAS ONLY DISTINGUISHABLE BECAUSE IN THAT SPOT THE DARKNESS SEEMED MORE DENSE THAN ELSEWHERE WHEN THE COUNT THOUGHT FRANZ HAD GAZED SUFFICIENTLY ON THIS PICTURESQUE TABLEAU HE RAISED HIS FINGER TO HIS LIPS
WHO GAINED THE PRIZE IN THE RACE TO DAY REPLIED FRANZ AND THEN MOREOVER WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO HIM WHO CAN TELL
HAD EVIDENTLY PARTAKEN OF SOME REFRESHMENTS AND A GLASS OF SOMETHING AND WAS IN MOST PLEASANT SPIRITS THE OTHER WAS A SHOPMAN OF JEWISH EXTRACTION THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PRICE OF WOOL WHEN NEKHLUDOFF CAME UP AND ASKED THEM IF THIS WAS THE JURYMEN'S ROOM
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT NEKHLUDOFF ASKED A LETTER FROM THE PRINCESS EITHER FROM THE MOTHER OR THE DAUGHTER THE MAID BROUGHT IT SOME TIME AGO AND IS WAITING IN MY ROOM
A MAN AND TWO WOMEN ONE OF THESE WOMEN AS THE CHIEF CRIMINAL TO BE CONDUCTED SEPARATELY
DUE ON THE FIRST THIS MONEY WOULD BE SENT ON BY THE NEXT MAIL
THE OTHER LETTER WAS FROM HIS STEWARD THE STEWARD WROTE TO TELL HIM THAT A VISIT TO HIS ESTATES WAS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENTER INTO POSSESSION AND ALSO TO DECIDE ABOUT THE FURTHER MANAGEMENT OF HIS LANDS
ALSO THE TERRIBLE SCENE HE HAD WITH HER WHEN SHE RAN OUT INTO THE PARK AND IN HER EXCITEMENT TRIED TO DROWN HERSELF IN THE POND
NEKHLUDOFF GAVE HIS NAME AND PASSED INTO THE JURYMEN'S ROOM INSIDE THE ROOM WERE ABOUT TEN PERSONS OF ALL SORTS THEY HAD COME BUT A SHORT WHILE AGO AND SOME WERE SITTING OTHERS WALKING UP AND DOWN
AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE DID NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO PROPOSE TO KORCHAGIN EVEN IF HE HAD WISHED TO DO SO AMONG THE LETTERS ON THE TABLE WAS ONE FROM THIS WOMAN'S HUSBAND SEEING HIS WRITING AND THE POSTMARK
BOUGHT FROM THE MOST EXPENSIVE DEALERS IN THESE GOODS HE QUITE KNEW WOULD NOT SERVE AS A REASON FOR CLAIMING SUPERIORITY AT THE SAME TIME HE DID CLAIM SUPERIORITY AND ACCEPTED THE RESPECT PAID HIM AS HIS DUE
HAVING REFRESHED HIS FULL WHITE MUSCULAR BODY AND DRIED IT WITH A ROUGH BATH SHEET HE PUT ON HIS FINE UNDERGARMENTS AND HIS BOOTS AND SAT DOWN BEFORE THE GLASS TO BRUSH HIS BLACK BEARD AND HIS CURLY HAIR
IT WAS NOT THIS SPRING MORNING MEN THOUGHT SACRED AND WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION NOT THE BEAUTY OF GOD'S WORLD GIVEN FOR A JOY TO ALL CREATURES THIS BEAUTY WHICH INCLINES THE HEART TO PEACE
HE LOOKED AT THE LUXURIOUS FITTINGS OF THE STUDIO WITH A HEAVY HEART AND IT WAS IN NO CHEERFUL MOOD THAT HE ENTERED HIS STUDY A LARGE LOFTY ROOM FITTED UP WITH A VIEW TO COMFORT CONVENIENCE AND ELEGANT APPEARANCE
THOUGH NEKHLUDOFF HAD ARRIVED LATE HE HAD TO WAIT A LONG TIME
IN RUSSIAN AS IN MANY OTHER LANGUAGES THOU IS USED GENERALLY AMONG PEOPLE VERY FAMILIAR WITH EACH OTHER OR BY SUPERIORS TO INFERIORS
THIS LETTER WAS PARTLY DISAGREEABLE AND PARTLY PLEASANT IT WAS PLEASANT TO FEEL THAT HE HAD POWER OVER SO LARGE A PROPERTY AND YET DISAGREEABLE
HE GAVE HER ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES AND OFFERED HER A SEPARATE LODGING NEXT DOOR TO THE LODGING RENTED FOR HER BY THE AUTHOR THERE LIVED A JOLLY YOUNG SHOPMAN WITH WHOM KATUSHA SOON FELL IN LOVE SHE TOLD THE AUTHOR
AND EXPLAINED IT BY HIS TOO FINELY DEVELOPED AESTHETIC TASTE STILL THE FEELING WAS A VERY UNPLEASANT ONE SEVEN YEARS BEFORE THIS HE HAD GIVEN UP MILITARY SERVICE FEELING SURE THAT HE HAD A TALENT FOR ART
CALLED OUT MASLOVA TO THE COURT AND CLOSED THE DOOR AGAIN EVEN INTO THE PRISON YARD THE BREEZE HAD BROUGHT THE FRESH VIVIFYING AIR FROM THE FIELDS
THEY CALLED HER KATUSHA WHICH SOUNDS LESS REFINED THAN KATINKA BUT IS NOT QUITE SO COMMON AS KATKA SHE USED TO SEW TIDY UP THE ROOMS
AFTER NEKHLUDOFF HAD ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY NAME IS BAKLASHEFF MERCHANT OF THE SECOND GUILD HE SAID PUTTING OUT HIS BROAD SOFT FLEXIBLE HAND WITH WHOM HAVE I THE HONOUR
EVEN THE ISVOSTCHIKS KNOW OF MY RELATIONS WITH THE KORCHAGINS THOUGHT NEKHLUDOFF AND AGAIN THE QUESTION WHETHER HE SHOULD NOT MARRY PRINCESS KORCHAGIN PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM AND HE COULD NOT DECIDE IT EITHER WAY
FIVE CHILDREN HAD DIED IN THIS WAY
THIS UNMARRIED WOMAN HAD A BABY EVERY YEAR AND AS OFTEN HAPPENS AMONG THE VILLAGE PEOPLE
AND THAT HE WAS HARDLY HER FIRST LOVE THIS LAST IDEA WAS PAINFUL TO HIM HIS PRIDE WOULD NOT RECONCILE ITSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD LOVED SOME ONE ELSE EVEN IN THE PAST
WHILE IT DAILY BECAME MORE DISTASTEFUL TO HIM HAVING SUCCUMBED TO THE TEMPTATION NEKHLUDOFF FELT GUILTY AND HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO BREAK THE TIE WITHOUT HER CONSENT
A PEASANT WHO HAD SOLD HIS CHARCOAL AND HAD HAD SOME TEA IN THE TOWN CAME UP AND AFTER CROSSING HIMSELF GAVE HER A COPECK THE PRISONER BLUSHED AND MUTTERED SOMETHING
STOPPED AND LOOKED CURIOUSLY AT THE PRISONER SOME SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND THOUGHT
ENTERED THE ROOM AND SAT DOWN AT ONCE NEAR KATUSHA SMILING AND GAZING AT HER WITH GLISTENING EYES HE BEGAN JOKING WITH HER THE HOSTESS CALLED HIM AWAY INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND KATUSHA HEARD HER SAY A FRESH ONE FROM THE COUNTRY
HIS VULGARITY IN SHORT AH HA YOU'RE ALSO TRAPPED THESE WERE THE WORDS ACCOMPANIED WITH BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER WITH WHICH PETER GERASIMOVITCH GREETED NEKHLUDOFF HAVE YOU NOT MANAGED TO GET OUT OF IT
FOR HER OWN GOOD AS HE EXPRESSED IT TO THIS LETTER HE HAD AS YET RECEIVED NO ANSWER THIS MIGHT PROVE A GOOD SIGN
TWENTY FIVE WENT TO GET THE BABY INTO THE FOUNDLINGS HOSPITAL AND FORTY THE MIDWIFE BORROWED TO BUY A COW WITH
ALL WERE GLAD THE PLANTS THE BIRDS THE INSECTS AND THE CHILDREN BUT MEN GROWN UP MEN AND WOMEN DID NOT LEAVE OFF CHEATING AND TORMENTING THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER
AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO A SMALL YOUNG WOMAN WITH A VERY FULL BUST CAME BRISKLY OUT OF THE DOOR AND WENT UP TO THE JAILER SHE HAD ON A GREY CLOAK OVER A WHITE JACKET AND PETTICOAT ON HER FEET
THE MARECHAL'S WIFE AND FINISH COMPLETELY WITH HER I CAN DO NOTHING HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND THE CONVICTION THAT HE MIGHT AND WAS EVEN OBLIGED TO DELAY HIS DECISION WAS COMFORTING WELL
A TABLE WHICH LOOKED VERY IMPOSING WITH ITS FOUR LEGS CARVED IN THE SHAPE OF LIONS PAWS AND A HUGE SIDE BOARD TO MATCH STOOD IN THE OBLONG ROOM THE FLOOR OF WHICH HAD BEEN POLISHED BY THREE MEN THE DAY BEFORE ON THE TABLE
WELL IT COULD NOT BE WORSE THAN IT IS NOW ANYHOW I ONLY WISH IT WAS SETTLED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
THE UNPRINCIPLED WIFE OF THE MARECHAL DE NOBLESSE OF A DISTRICT WHERE NEKHLUDOFF WAS PRESENT AT AN ELECTION THE DESIRE OF VANQUISHING HIM THIS WOMAN DREW HIM INTO AN INTIMACY WHICH ENTANGLED HIM MORE AND MORE
AND SPENT ALL HE COULD LAY HANDS ON AT THE PUBLIC HOUSE
THE LITTLE BLACK EYED MAIDEN GREW TO BE EXTREMELY PRETTY AND SO FULL OF SPIRITS THAT THE LADIES FOUND HER VERY ENTERTAINING THE YOUNGER OF THE LADIES SOPHIA IVANOVNA
HE PRESSED THE BUTTON OF AN ELECTRIC BELL AND HIS SERVANT AN ELDERLY MOROSE LOOKING MAN WITH WHISKERS AND SHAVED CHIN AND LIP WEARING A GREY COTTON APRON ENTERED AT THE DOOR SEND TO FETCH AN ISVOSTCHIK PLEASE YES SIR
MASLOVA'S MOTHER WAS THE UNMARRIED DAUGHTER OF A VILLAGE WOMAN
AND CONSIDERING IT WRONG TO HOLD LANDED PROPERTY
AND SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE
WAS TO NEKHLUDOFF A PROOF OF HER GOOD SENSE AND CORRECT JUDGMENT AGAINST MARRYING MISSY IN PARTICULAR WAS THAT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD A GIRL WITH EVEN HIGHER QUALITIES COULD BE FOUND THAT SHE WAS ALREADY TWENTY SEVEN
AND MANAGED TO SUPPORT HERSELF HER CHILDREN AND HER WRETCHED HUSBAND
NEKHLUDOFF NEVER KNEW HIS SURNAME AND EVEN BRAGGED A BIT ABOUT THIS THIS MAN WAS NOW A MASTER AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL NEKHLUDOFF COULD NOT STAND HIS FAMILIARITY HIS SELF SATISFIED LAUGHTER
AND THERE MET A WOMAN WITH BRACELETS ON HER BARE PLUMP ARMS AND RINGS ON MOST OF HER FINGERS HEARING THAT KATUSHA WAS BADLY IN WANT OF A PLACE THE WOMAN GAVE HER HER ADDRESS AND INVITED HER TO COME TO HER HOUSE KATUSHA WENT
A WEEK AGO HE HAD WRITTEN HER A DECISIVE LETTER IN WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS GUILT AND HIS READINESS TO ATONE FOR IT
INFECTED KATUSHA AND HER BABY BOY HAD TO BE SENT TO THE FOUNDLINGS HOSPITAL
THAT HE HAD A LIAISON WITH A MARRIED WOMAN AND THOUGH HE CONSIDERED IT BROKEN OFF SHE DID NOT NEKHLUDOFF WAS RATHER SHY WITH WOMEN AND HIS VERY SHYNESS AWAKENED IN THIS MARRIED WOMAN
BESIDE THE USUAL HESITATION OF MEN PAST THEIR YOUTH TO MARRY UNLESS THEY ARE VERY MUCH IN LOVE
REEKING OF TOBACCO AND POINTING TO THE PRISONER REMARKED TAKE HER THE SOLDIER
IT FLUTTERED UP AND FLEW CLOSE TO HER EAR FANNING HER WITH ITS WINGS
THEIR FACES ALL HAD A CERTAIN LOOK OF SATISFACTION AT THE PROSPECT OF FULFILLING A PUBLIC DUTY ALTHOUGH MANY OF THEM HAD HAD TO LEAVE THEIR BUSINESSES AND MOST WERE COMPLAINING OF IT THE JURYMEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES ABOUT THE WEATHER
WHO LAUGHED AT HIMSELF AND CALLED HIMSELF THE ASS OF THE FABLE REMAINING LIKE THAT ANIMAL UNDECIDED WHICH HAYCOCK TO TURN TO AT ANY RATE BEFORE I GET AN ANSWER FROM MARY VASILIEVNA
AND WALKED AWAY WITH SUCH A LOOK OF SADNESS ON HIS FACE AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN NATURAL IF HE HAD JUST HEARD OF THE DEATH OF ALL HIS RELATIONS HE CAME UP TO A GROUP THAT HAD FORMED ITSELF ROUND A CLEAN SHAVEN TALL DIGNIFIED MAN
THAT JUSTICE FORBIDS PRIVATE LANDHOLDING AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD RESOLUTENESS OF HIS AGE HAD NOT MERELY SPOKEN TO PROVE THAT LAND COULD NOT BE LOOKED UPON AS PRIVATE PROPERTY AND WRITTEN ESSAYS ON THAT SUBJECT AT THE UNIVERSITY
WERE GONE AS TO THE SECOND COURSE THAT OF DENYING THOSE CLEAR AND UNANSWERABLE PROOFS OF THE INJUSTICE OF LANDHOLDING WHICH HE HAD DRAWN FROM SPENCER'S SOCIAL STATICS
FROM INSIDE THE CELL CAME THE SOUND OF BUSTLE AND WOMEN'S VOICES AND THE PATTER OF BARE FEET ON THE FLOOR
BEFORE PROCEEDING TO JOIN HIS REGIMENT
NEKHLUDOFF HAD HEARD THAT THERE WAS SOME OFFICER WHO WAS PAYING HER MARKED ATTENTION AND THIS TORMENTED HIM BY AWAKENING JEALOUSY AND AT THE SAME TIME ENCOURAGED HIM WITH THE HOPE OF ESCAPE FROM THE DECEPTION THAT WAS OPPRESSING HIM
AND THE SHOPMAN AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD INJURED HER
AGAINST MARRIAGE IN GENERAL WAS THE FEAR COMMON TO BACHELORS PAST THEIR FIRST YOUTH OF LOSING FREEDOM AND AN UNCONSCIOUS AWE BEFORE THIS MYSTERIOUS CREATURE A WOMAN
THE SHOPMAN WHO PROMISED TO MARRY HER
TRADESPEOPLE COOKS
THE OLD MAIDEN LADY SCOLDED THE MAIDS AGAIN
LOOKING STRAIGHT INTO THE EYES OF THE JAILER READY TO COMPLY WITH ANY ORDER THE JAILER WAS ABOUT TO LOCK THE DOOR
AND BESIDE THE PLATE LAY THE LAST NUMBER OF THE REVUE DES DEUX MONDES A NEWSPAPER AND SEVERAL LETTERS NEKHLUDOFF WAS JUST GOING TO OPEN HIS LETTERS WHEN A STOUT MIDDLE AGED WOMAN IN MOURNING
STILL SPRING WAS SPRING EVEN IN THE TOWN THE SUN SHONE WARM THE AIR WAS BALMY
I SHALL CONSIDER ALL THAT LATER ON HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS THE TRAP DROVE SILENTLY ALONG THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT UP TO THE DOORS OF THE COURT NOW I MUST FULFIL MY PUBLIC DUTIES CONSCIENTIOUSLY AS I AM IN THE HABIT OF ALWAYS DOING
TURNING HALF ROUND WHEN I DROVE UP AND THE SWISS AT THE DOOR SAYS JUST GONE THE ISVOSTCHIK KNEW THAT NEKHLUDOFF VISITED AT THE KORCHAGINS AND CALLED THERE ON THE CHANCE OF BEING ENGAGED BY HIM
KATUSHA HAD TO LOOK OUT FOR A PLACE AGAIN
WHICH THERE IS THE CIVIL COURT AND THE CRIMINAL COURT I AM ON THE JURY THE CRIMINAL COURT YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID HERE TO THE RIGHT THEN TO THE LEFT THE SECOND DOOR NEKHLUDOFF FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION
AND HE TAKING IT AS HIS DUE AS HE ALWAYS DID WHEN AMONG STRANGERS HAD HE BEEN ASKED WHY HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF ABOVE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HE COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN AN ANSWER
AND AFTER GIVING HER A ONE HUNDRED ROUBLE NOTE WENT AWAY FIVE MONTHS LATER
THE SIXTH BABY WHOSE FATHER WAS A GIPSY TRAMP WOULD HAVE SHARED THE SAME FATE HAD IT NOT SO HAPPENED THAT ONE OF THE MAIDEN LADIES CAME INTO THE FARMYARD TO SCOLD THE DAIRYMAIDS FOR SENDING UP CREAM THAT SMELT OF THE COW
WHO HAD STOOD GODMOTHER TO THE GIRL HAD THE KINDER HEART OF THE TWO SISTERS
HE COULD NOT PROPOSE AT ONCE IT WAS NOT THAT TEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BETRAYED AND FORSAKEN MASLOVA HE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THAT AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE CONSIDERED IT A REASON FOR NOT MARRYING NO THE REASON WAS
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SHARED THE SAME FATE
PUT THE PAPER INTO THE SLEEVE OF HIS COAT WINKED
WITHOUT BEING PAID HER WAGES
SHE WAS EXACTING SHE PUNISHED AND WHEN IN A BAD TEMPER EVEN STRUCK THE LITTLE GIRL GROWING UP UNDER THESE TWO DIFFERENT INFLUENCES THE GIRL TURNED OUT HALF SERVANT HALF YOUNG LADY
THEREFORE EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD HIM THIS UNDERSTANDING OF HIM
THE TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES SOON WENT SOME SHE PAID TO HER AUNT FOR BOARD AND LODGING THE REST WAS SPENT ON A HAT RIBBONS AND SUCH LIKE A FEW DAYS LATER THE AUTHOR SENT FOR HER AND SHE WENT
THANKING HER FOR THE INVITATION AND PROMISING TO TRY AND COME TO DINNER HAVING WRITTEN ONE NOTE HE TORE IT UP AS IT SEEMED TOO INTIMATE HE WROTE ANOTHER BUT IT WAS TOO COLD HE FEARED IT MIGHT GIVE OFFENCE SO HE TORE IT UP TOO
WROTE ONLY TO LET NEKHLUDOFF KNOW THAT THERE WAS TO BE A SPECIAL MEETING TOWARDS THE END OF MAY AND THAT NEKHLUDOFF WAS TO BE SURE AND COME TO
AND SHE REMAINED WITH THE SON AS HIS HOUSEKEEPER AGRAPHENA PETROVNA HAD SPENT NEARLY TEN YEARS AT DIFFERENT TIMES ABROAD WITH NEKHLUDOFF'S MOTHER AND HAD THE APPEARANCE AND MANNERS OF A LADY
PRINCE DMITRI IVANOVITCH NEKHLUDOFF WHO HAD SEDUCED HER WAS STILL LYING ON HIS HIGH BEDSTEAD WITH A FEATHER BED ON THE TOP OF THE SPRING MATTRESS IN A FINE CLEAN WELL IRONED LINEN NIGHT SHIRT
AND DO OTHER LIGHT WORK AND SOMETIMES SHE SAT AND READ TO THE LADIES THOUGH SHE HAD MORE THAN ONE OFFER SHE WOULD NOT MARRY SHE FELT THAT LIFE AS THE WIFE OF ANY OF THE WORKING MEN WHO WERE COURTING HER
OF COURSE SHE COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE SHOULD MEET HIM BUT THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS CAPABLE OF LOVING ANOTHER OFFENDED HIM SO THAT HE HAD AS MANY REASONS FOR MARRYING AS AGAINST IT AT ANY RATE THEY WEIGHED EQUALLY WITH NEKHLUDOFF
AND DROVE HER TO THE NOTORIOUS HOUSE KEPT BY CAROLINA ALBERTOVNA KITAEVA FROM THAT DAY A LIFE OF CHRONIC SIN AGAINST HUMAN AND DIVINE LAWS COMMENCED FOR KATUSHA MASLOVA
EVERYTHING SEEMED REPUGNANT TO HER
PASSED HITHER AND THITHER PLAINTIFFS AND THOSE OF THE ACCUSED WHO WERE NOT GUARDED WANDERED SADLY ALONG THE WALLS OR SAT WAITING WHERE IS THE LAW COURT NEKHLUDOFF ASKED OF AN ATTENDANT
THE WOMAN RECEIVED HER VERY KINDLY SET CAKE AND SWEET WINE BEFORE HER THEN WROTE A NOTE AND GAVE IT TO A SERVANT TO TAKE TO SOMEBODY IN THE EVENING A TALL MAN WITH LONG GREY HAIR AND A WHITE BEARD
MANNER OF SPEAKING WALKING LAUGHING FROM THE COMMON PEOPLE NOT BY ANYTHING EXCEPTIONAL BUT BY HER GOOD BREEDING HE COULD FIND NO OTHER TERM FOR THIS QUALITY THOUGH HE PRIZED IT VERY HIGHLY
AND MASLOVA STEPPED OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CORRIDOR
AND WAS HURT IF HE DID NOT GET IT IN THE JURYMEN'S ROOM HIS FEELINGS WERE HURT BY DISRESPECTFUL TREATMENT AMONG THE JURY THERE HAPPENED TO BE A MAN WHOM HE KNEW A FORMER TEACHER OF HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN PETER GERASIMOVITCH
SHE HAD LIVED WITH THE NEKHLUDOFFS FROM THE TIME SHE WAS A CHILD AND HAD KNOWN DMITRI IVANOVITCH AT THE TIME WHEN HE WAS STILL LITTLE MITINKA GOOD MORNING DMITRI IVANOVITCH GOOD MORNING AGRAPHENA PETROVNA
I NEVER MEANT TO GET OUT OF IT REPLIED NEKHLUDOFF GLOOMILY AND IN A TONE OF SEVERITY WELL I CALL THIS BEING PUBLIC SPIRITED BUT JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU GET HUNGRY OR SLEEPY YOU'LL SING TO ANOTHER TUNE THEN
PUPILS AT A PUBLIC DAY SCHOOL
WHO STOOD WASHING OR IRONING WITH THEIR THIN ARMS IN THE FEARFULLY HOT FRONT ROOM
AND BEGAN SPEAKING TO MASLOVA BUT THE JAILER CLOSED THE DOOR PUSHING THE OLD WOMAN'S HEAD WITH IT A WOMAN'S LAUGHTER WAS HEARD FROM THE CELL AND MASLOVA SMILED
BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES
THE ELDER A BIG FELLOW WITH MOUSTACHES
NEKHLUDOFF FLUSHED AND FELT HIS ENERGIES AWAKENING AS THEY ALWAYS DID WHEN HE WAS FACING ANY KIND OF DANGER BUT HIS EXCITEMENT PASSED AT ONCE THE MARECHAL DO NOBLESSE OF THE DISTRICT IN WHICH HIS LARGEST ESTATE LAY
WHETHER IT WAS TO CONTINUE IN THE SAME WAY AS WHEN HIS MOTHER WAS ALIVE OR WHETHER AS HE HAD REPRESENTED TO THE LATE LAMENTED PRINCESS AND NOW ADVISED THE YOUNG PRINCE THEY HAD NOT BETTER INCREASE THEIR STOCK
THEY DESCENDED THE STONE STAIRS
THEN FROM A TAP FIXED TO HIS MARBLE WASHSTAND HE LET A SPRAY OF COLD WATER RUN OVER HIS FACE AND STOUT NECK HAVING FINISHED THIS PART OF THE BUSINESS HE WENT INTO A THIRD ROOM WHERE A SHOWER BATH STOOD READY FOR HIM
AND ENTERED THE OFFICE WHERE TWO SOLDIERS WERE WAITING TO ESCORT HER
A WEALTHY AND ARISTOCRATIC FAMILY WHOSE DAUGHTER EVERY ONE EXPECTED HE WOULD MARRY HE SIGHED AND THROWING AWAY THE END OF HIS CIGARETTE WAS GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER OUT OF THE SILVER CASE BUT CHANGING HIS MIND
AND THE BRILLIANT CORROBORATION OF WHICH HE HAD AT A LATER PERIOD FOUND IN THE WORKS OF HENRY GEORGE
IT WAS NOT THE FACT THAT MEN AND ANIMALS HAD RECEIVED THE GRACE AND GLADNESS OF SPRING THAT WAS CONSIDERED SACRED AND IMPORTANT BUT THAT A NOTICE NUMBERED AND WITH A SUPERSCRIPTION HAD COME THE DAY BEFORE
BUT SEEING WHAT A LIFE OF MISERY AND HARDSHIP HER AUNT'S ASSISTANTS LED KATUSHA HESITATED AND APPLIED TO A REGISTRY OFFICE
THE ADVOCATE IS A GENIUS HE SAID THE LISTENERS HEARD IT ALL WITH RESPECTFUL ATTENTION AND SEVERAL OF THEM TRIED TO PUT IN A WORD BUT THE MAN INTERRUPTED THEM AS IF HE ALONE KNEW ALL ABOUT IT
TO THE PEASANTS INHERITING HIS MOTHER'S LARGE ESTATES AND THUS BECOMING A LANDED PROPRIETOR HE HAD TO CHOOSE ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER TO GIVE UP HIS PROPERTY AS HE HAD GIVEN UP HIS FATHER'S LAND TEN YEARS BEFORE
HER SMALL BROAD HANDS AND FULL NECK WHICH SHOWED FROM UNDER THE BROAD COLLAR OF HER CLOAK WERE OF THE SAME HUE HER BLACK SPARKLING EYES ONE WITH A SLIGHT SQUINT
PUTREFACTION AND TAR EVERY NEWCOMER FELT SAD AND DEJECTED IN IT THE WOMAN WARDER FELT THIS THOUGH SHE WAS USED TO BAD AIR SHE HAD JUST COME IN FROM OUTSIDE
WITH INDIA RUBBER TIRES TO HIS TRAP WAS AT THE DOOR WAITING FOR HIM
WHERE A FEW STUDIES HUNG ON THE WALLS AND FACING THE EASEL STOOD AN UNFINISHED PICTURE A FEELING OF INABILITY TO ADVANCE IN ART A SENSE OF HIS INCAPACITY CAME OVER HIM HE HAD OFTEN HAD THIS FEELING OF LATE
AT THE IMPORTANT DEBATES CONCERNING THE SCHOOLS AND THE ROADS AS A STRONG OPPOSITION BY THE REACTIONARY PARTY WAS EXPECTED THE MARECHAL WAS A LIBERAL AND WAS QUITE ENGROSSED IN THIS FIGHT
A LACE CAP COVERING THE WIDENING PARTING OF HER HAIR GLIDED INTO THE ROOM THIS WAS AGRAPHENA PETROVNA FORMERLY LADY'S MAID TO NEKHLUDOFF'S MOTHER HER MISTRESS HAD DIED QUITE RECENTLY IN THIS VERY HOUSE
PUT IT AWAY AND SAILED OUT OF THE ROOM NEKHLUDOFF OPENED THE PERFUMED NOTE AND BEGAN READING IT THE NOTE WAS WRITTEN ON A SHEET OF THICK GREY PAPER WITH ROUGH EDGES THE WRITING LOOKED ENGLISH
WHOM AGRAPHENA PETROVNA EXPECTED HIM TO MARRY THIS SUPPOSITION OF HERS ANNOYED NEKHLUDOFF THEN I'LL TELL HER TO WAIT AND AGRAPHENA PETROVNA TOOK A CRUMB BRUSH WHICH WAS NOT IN ITS PLACE
BEGAN BEATING HER KATUSHA DEFENDED HERSELF AND THEY HAD A FIGHT
WAS NEGLECTED BY ITS MOTHER WHOM IT HINDERED AT HER WORK
TRIMMED WITH BLACK VELVET WITH LOW NECK AND SHORT SLEEVES CONQUERED HER
AND FARM ALL THE LAND NOW RENTED BY THE PEASANTS THEMSELVES THE STEWARD WROTE THAT THIS WOULD BE A FAR MORE PROFITABLE WAY OF MANAGING THE PROPERTY
THE ATTENDANTS HURRIED OUT OF BREATH DRAGGING THEIR FEET ALONG THE GROUND WITHOUT LIFTING THEM BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH ALL SORTS OF MESSAGES AND PAPERS
AND HAD LOOKED DOWN WITH SOME DISDAIN AT ALL OTHER ACTIVITY FROM THE HEIGHT OF HIS ARTISTIC STANDPOINT AND NOW IT TURNED OUT THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO DO SO AND THEREFORE EVERYTHING THAT REMINDED HIM OF ALL THIS WAS UNPLEASANT
THERE HE CAREFULLY CLEANED HIS TEETH MANY OF WHICH WERE FILLED WITH TOOTH POWDER AND RINSED HIS MOUTH WITH SCENTED ELIXIR AFTER THAT HE WASHED HIS HANDS WITH PERFUMED SOAP CLEANED HIS LONG NAILS WITH PARTICULAR CARE
THE EARLY SPRING AND THE BUSINESS BEFORE THEM SOME HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED OTHERS JUST GUESSING WHO WAS WHO THOSE WHO WERE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH NEKHLUDOFF MADE HASTE TO GET INTRODUCED EVIDENTLY LOOKING UPON THIS AS AN HONOUR
MISSY WHEN NEKHLUDOFF HAD FINISHED HIS COFFEE HE WENT TO HIS STUDY TO LOOK AT THE SUMMONS AND FIND OUT WHAT TIME HE WAS TO APPEAR AT THE COURT BEFORE WRITING HIS ANSWER TO THE PRINCESS PASSING THROUGH HIS STUDIO
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IN FAVOUR OF MARRYING MISSY HER NAME WAS MARY BUT AS IS USUAL AMONG A CERTAIN SET A NICKNAME HAD BEEN GIVEN HER WAS THAT SHE CAME OF GOOD FAMILY AND DIFFERED IN EVERYTHING
A LIFE WHICH IS LED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN AND WHICH IS NOT MERELY TOLERATED BUT SANCTIONED BY THE GOVERNMENT ANXIOUS FOR THE WELFARE OF ITS SUBJECTS
MOREOVER HE HAD FORMED LUXURIOUS HABITS WHICH HE COULD NOT EASILY GIVE UP BESIDES HE HAD NO LONGER THE SAME INDUCEMENTS
THE OLD LADIES SPOKE OF HER AS THE SAVED ONE WHEN THE CHILD WAS THREE YEARS OLD HER MOTHER FELL ILL AND DIED
BECAUSE NEKHLUDOFF HAD BEEN AN ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRER OF HENRY GEORGE AND HERBERT SPENCER BEING HIMSELF HEIR TO A LARGE PROPERTY HE WAS ESPECIALLY STRUCK BY THE POSITION TAKEN UP BY SPENCER IN SOCIAL STATICS
HE RESOLUTELY RAISED HIS SOLID FRAME AND PUTTING DOWN HIS SMOOTH WHITE LEGS STEPPED INTO HIS SLIPPERS THREW HIS SILK DRESSING GOWN OVER HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND PASSED INTO HIS DRESSING ROOM WALKING HEAVILY AND QUICKLY
AS THE FACT THAT IT GAVE HER A CHANCE OF FORGETTING THE MISERY SHE SUFFERED
APPEARED IN STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE DULL PALLOR OF HER FACE SHE CARRIED HERSELF VERY STRAIGHT EXPANDING HER FULL BOSOM WITH HER HEAD SLIGHTLY THROWN BACK
NO MATTER WHAT COLOR HE WAS MADE STILL HE HAD A GOOD HEART SAID THE DOCTOR ROMANTIC OF COURSE BUT A GOOD HEART AFTER ALL HANDSOME IS AS HANDSOME DOES
THEY SEEMED TO HAVE DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER INDEED THEY HAD LOST THEIR WAY VERY BADLY THEY HAD STRAYED A LONG WAY OFF THE PATH AND THE JUNGLE
LOST THE MEDICINE BAG IN THE UNDER BRUSH THERE SEEMED NO END TO THEIR TROUBLES AND NOWHERE COULD THEY COME UPON A PATH AT LAST
THOSE WHO STAYED BEHIND CHEE CHEE POLYNESIA AND THE CROCODILE GREW TERRIBLY SAD FOR NEVER IN THEIR LIVES HAD THEY KNOWN ANY ONE THEY LIKED SO WELL AS DOCTOR JOHN DOLITTLE
THE NOISE GREW LOUDER AND BIGGER IT SEEMED TO BE COMING NEARER TO THEM A SOUND LIKE THE AUTUMN WIND BLOWING THROUGH THE LEAVES OF A POPLAR TREE OR A GREAT
SHE WAS SAYING NOTHING AND BLINKING HER EYES THIS WAS ALWAYS A VERY BAD SIGN WITH POLYNESIA WHENEVER SHE SAID NOTHING AND BLINKED HER EYES
AND WHO KNOWS HE MAY STAY WHITE AFTER ALL THE SLEEPING BEAUTY WOULD NEVER HAVE HIM EVEN IF HE DID SAID DAB DAB HE LOOKED BETTER THE WAY HE WAS I THOUGHT BUT HE'D NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT UGLY
BUT IT ISN'T SO EASY TO TURN A BLACK MAN WHITE YOU SPEAK AS THOUGH HE WERE A DRESS TO BE RE DYED IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE SHALL THE LEOPARD CHANGE HIS SPOTS OR THE ETHIOPIAN HIS SKIN
THE LAND WHERE THEY WERE BORN AND WHEN THE DOCTOR STOOD UPON THE BOAT HE LOOKED OVER THE SIDE ACROSS THE WATER AND THEN HE REMEMBERED
NOW ONE SUNSHINY DAY THE DOCTOR AND DAB DAB WERE WALKING UP AND DOWN ON THE SHIP FOR EXERCISE A NICE FRESH WIND WAS BLOWING THE BOAT ALONG AND EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY
SPREAD THICK WELL THAT NIGHT PRINCE BUMPO CAME SECRETLY TO THE DOCTOR IN PRISON AND SAID TO HIM WHITE MAN I AM AN UNHAPPY PRINCE YEARS AGO
TRYING TO SNIFF THE COOKING SMELLS THAT CAME FROM THE PALACE KITCHEN SHE TOLD THE PIG TO BRING THE DOCTOR TO THE WINDOW BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO SPEAK TO HIM SO GUB GUB WENT AND WOKE THE DOCTOR
RAN AS FAST AS THEY COULD DOWN TO THE SEASHORE WHILE BUMPO LEANED AGAINST THE WALL OF THE EMPTY DUNGEON SMILING AFTER THEM HAPPILY HIS BIG FACE SHINING LIKE POLISHED IVORY IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON
SO THE PRINCE PROMISED AND WENT AWAY TO GET A SHIP READY AT THE SEASHORE WHEN HE CAME BACK AND SAID THAT IT WAS DONE THE DOCTOR ASKED DAB DAB
GETTING THEIR CLOTHES TORN AND THEIR FACES COVERED WITH MUD THEY WALKED RIGHT INTO THE KING'S BACK GARDEN BY MISTAKE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUNNING UP AT ONCE AND CAUGHT THEM
SAID THE DOCTOR LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY AT THE BOTTLES IN HIS MEDICINE BAG SUPPOSING I MADE YOUR HAIR A NICE BLONDE COLOR WOULD NOT THAT DO INSTEAD TO MAKE YOU HAPPY NO SAID BUMPO
THE BOAT DID NOT GO NEARLY AS FAST AS THE PIRATES' WHICH KEPT COMING ON BEHIND CLOSER AND CLOSER THIS IS A POOR SHIP THE PRINCE GAVE US SAID GUB GUB THE PIG
BUMPO BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT KEEP THE LOOKING GLASS AS IT WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI AND HE WANTED TO LOOK AT HIMSELF ALL DAY LONG BUT THE DOCTOR SAID
LIKE THIS AT SEA THEY WOULD STEAL EVERYTHING ON IT AND AFTER THEY HAD TAKEN THE PEOPLE OFF THEY WOULD SINK THE SHIP AND SAIL BACK TO BARBARY SINGING SONGS AND FEELING PROUD OF THE MISCHIEF THEY HAD DONE
WHO WAS TAKING A NAP LISTEN WHISPERED THE PARROT WHEN JOHN DOLITTLE'S FACE APPEARED PRINCE BUMPO IS COMING HERE TO NIGHT TO SEE YOU
AND IN A MOMENT THE DOCTOR FOUND HIMSELF TRAVELING SO FAST HE HAD TO HOLD HIS HAT ON WITH BOTH HANDS FOR HE FELT AS THOUGH THE SHIP ITSELF
YOU ASK HIM THEN JIP STILL FAST ASLEEP BEGAN TO GROWL AGAIN AND HIS LIP CURLED UP ANGRILY SHOWING HIS CLEAN WHITE TEETH I SMELL BAD MEN
SO I COME TO YOU FOR HELP IF YOU WILL TURN ME WHITE SO THAT I MAY GO BACK TO THE SLEEPING BEAUTY I WILL GIVE YOU HALF MY KINGDOM AND ANYTHING BESIDES YOU ASK PRINCE BUMPO
WAS SO THICK WITH BUSHES AND CREEPERS AND VINES THAT SOMETIMES THEY COULD HARDLY MOVE AT ALL AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO TAKE OUT HIS POCKET KNIFE AND CUT HIS WAY ALONG
AND FLEW OFF PULLING THE BOAT ALONG AND ALTHOUGH SWALLOWS ARE NOT VERY STRONG WHEN ONLY ONE OR TWO ARE BY THEMSELVES IT IS DIFFERENT WHEN THERE ARE A GREAT LOT OF THEM TOGETHER
AND ALL THE ANIMALS ON THE SHIP BEGAN TO LAUGH AND DANCE ABOUT IN THE RUSHING AIR FOR WHEN THEY LOOKED BACK AT THE PIRATES SHIP THEY COULD SEE THAT IT WAS GROWING SMALLER NOW INSTEAD OF BIGGER
LOOKING AT ALL THE BOTTLES HE HAD USED FOR THE MIXTURE AND READING THE LABELS ON THEM AGAIN AND AGAIN A STRONG SMELL FILLED THE PRISON LIKE THE SMELL OF BROWN PAPER BURNING AT LAST
HIS FATHER WHO HAD US LOCKED UP IT WASN'T BUMPO'S FAULT I WONDER IF I OUGHT TO GO BACK AND APOLOGIZE OH WELL
TO BRING A BASIN THEN HE MIXED A LOT OF MEDICINES IN THE BASIN AND TOLD BUMPO TO DIP HIS FACE IN IT THE PRINCE LEANED DOWN AND PUT HIS FACE IN
DON'T MOVE WHATEVER YOU DO AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS PRINCE BUMPO THE KING'S SON OPENING THE GARDEN GATE HE CARRIED A BOOK OF FAIRY TALES UNDER HIS ARM
HE NEEDED IT TO SHAVE WITH THEN THE PRINCE TAKING A BUNCH OF COPPER KEYS FROM HIS POCKET UNDID THE GREAT DOUBLE LOCKS AND THE DOCTOR WITH ALL HIS ANIMALS
GO TO HIM BRAVE BUMPO SECRETLY WHEN THE SUN HAS SET AND BEHOLD THOU SHALT BE MADE THE WHITEST PRINCE THAT EVER WON FAIR LADY
THE KING'S SON LAID THE BOOK DOWN AND SIGHED A WEARY SIGH IF I WERE ONLY A WHITE PRINCE SAID HE WITH A DREAMY FAR AWAY LOOK IN HIS EYES THEN THE PARROT
IT MEANT THAT SOMEBODY HAD BEEN MAKING TROUBLE AND SHE WAS THINKING OUT SOME WAY TO PUT THINGS RIGHT PEOPLE WHO MADE TROUBLE FOR POLYNESIA OR HER FRIENDS
YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF MEDICINES LEFT IN THE BAG HE'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU IF YOU CHANGE HIS COLOR IT IS YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO GET OUT OF PRISON WELL
IF THE KING SHOULD HEAR US HE WILL SEND HIS SOLDIERS TO CATCH US AGAIN FOR I AM SURE HE IS STILL VERY ANGRY OVER THE TRICK I PLAYED ON HIM WHAT I AM WONDERING
SO YOU ARE CAUGHT AGAIN THIS TIME YOU SHALL NOT ESCAPE TAKE THEM ALL BACK TO PRISON AND PUT DOUBLE LOCKS ON THE DOOR
USED TO WAIT FOR SAILORS TO BE SHIPWRECKED ON THEIR SHORES AND OFTEN IF THEY SAW A BOAT PASSING THEY WOULD COME OUT IN THEIR FAST SAILING SHIPS AND CHASE IT WHEN THEY CAUGHT A BOAT
CAN'T BLAME HER FOR GETTING SCARED I WONDER WHO HE'LL GO AND KISS THIS TIME SILLY BUSINESS THEN THE PUSHMI PULLYU THE WHITE MOUSE GUB GUB DAB DAB
THEY STUMBLED INTO WET BOGGY PLACES THEY GOT ALL TANGLED UP IN THICK CONVOLVULUS RUNNERS THEY SCRATCHED THEMSELVES ON THORNS AND TWICE THEY NEARLY
I WENT IN SEARCH OF THE SLEEPING BEAUTY WHOM I HAD READ OF IN A BOOK AND HAVING TRAVELED THROUGH THE WORLD MANY DAYS I AT LAST FOUND HER
TALKING IN A SMALL HIGH VOICE LIKE A LITTLE GIRL SAID ALOUD BUMPO SOME ONE MIGHT TURN THEE INTO A WHITE PRINCE PERCHANCE THE KING'S SON
WERE NEARLY ALWAYS SORRY FOR IT AFTERWARDS PRESENTLY SHE SPIED CHEE CHEE SWINGING THROUGH THE TREES STILL LOOKING FOR THE DOCTOR WHEN CHEE CHEE SAW HER HE CAME INTO HER TREE
NO SOUND BUT THIS GREAT RUSTLING OF FEATHERS WHICH GREW GREATER NOW THAN EVER WHEN THEY BEGAN TO SETTLE ON THE SANDS ALONG THE ROPES OF THE SHIP
GOT LOST IN THE DEEP WOODS THEY WANDERED AROUND AND AROUND BUT COULD NOT FIND THEIR WAY DOWN TO THE SEASHORE CHEE CHEE WHEN HE COULD NOT SEE THEM ANYWHERE WAS TERRIBLY UPSET
AND WHILE HE WAS AWAY THE DOCTOR AND THE REST OF THE ANIMALS
MOST LIKELY HE WILL BE AS BLACK AS EVER WHEN HE WAKES UP IN THE MORNING THAT'S ONE REASON WHY I DIDN'T LIKE TO LEAVE THE MIRROR WITH HIM BUT THEN AGAIN HE MIGHT STAY WHITE I HAD NEVER USED THAT MIXTURE BEFORE
SAID THE DOCTOR IS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO GET ANOTHER BOAT TO GO HOME IN OH WELL PERHAPS WE'LL FIND ONE LYING ABOUT ON THE BEACH THAT NOBODY IS USING NEVER LIFT YOUR FOOT
BUT WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN SOMEWHERE ELSE SO I CAME BACK FULL OF SADNESS TO MY FATHER'S KINGDOM
TO TELL THE TRUTH I WAS SURPRISED MYSELF THAT IT WORKED SO WELL BUT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING DIDN'T I I COULDN'T POSSIBLY SCRUB THE KING'S KITCHEN FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IT WAS SUCH A DIRTY KITCHEN
AND FETCH ME ALL THE SAILS YOU SEE THE DOG HURRIED DOWNSTAIRS AND DRAGGED UP EVERY SAIL HE COULD FIND BUT EVEN WHEN ALL THESE WERE PUT UP ON THE MASTS TO CATCH THE WIND
THAT POOR SAILOR WILL THINK I'VE STOLEN HIS SHIP IF I DON'T GET HOME SOON I WONDER IF THOSE HINGES ARE LOOSE BUT THE DOOR WAS VERY STRONG AND FIRMLY LOCKED
DO NOT SPEAK A WORD OF THIS TO ANY ONE AND WHEN I HAVE DONE AS YOU ASK YOU MUST LET ME AND ALL MY ANIMALS OUT OF PRISON PROMISE BY THE CROWN OF JOLLIGINKI
BY THE EDGE OF THE RIVER THEY STOPPED AND SAID FAREWELL THIS TOOK A LONG TIME BECAUSE ALL THOSE THOUSANDS OF MONKEYS WANTED TO SHAKE JOHN DOLITTLE BY THE HAND
THEN THEY USED TO MAKE THE PEOPLE THEY HAD CAUGHT WRITE HOME TO THEIR FRIENDS FOR MONEY AND IF THE FRIENDS SENT NO MONEY THE PIRATES OFTEN THREW THE PEOPLE INTO THE SEA
BUT POLYNESIA FLEW INTO A TREE IN THE GARDEN WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING HER AND HID HERSELF
THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF GETTING OUT THEN GUB GUB BEGAN TO CRY AGAIN ALL THIS TIME POLYNESIA WAS STILL SITTING IN THE TREE IN THE PALACE GARDEN
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT SAID POLYNESIA IMPATIENTLY BUT YOU MUST
HE CAME STROLLING DOWN THE GRAVEL WALK HUMMING A SAD SONG TILL HE REACHED A STONE SEAT RIGHT UNDER THE TREE WHERE THE PARROT AND THE MONKEY WERE HIDING THEN HE LAY DOWN ON THE SEAT
SAID THE DOCTOR QUICKLY WELL I WILL DO WHAT I CAN FOR YOU YOU WILL HAVE TO BE VERY PATIENT THOUGH YOU KNOW WITH SOME MEDICINES YOU CAN NEVER BE VERY SURE I MIGHT HAVE TO TRY TWO OR THREE TIMES
JIP AND THE OWL TOO TOO WENT ON TO THE SHIP WITH THE DOCTOR BUT CHEE CHEE POLYNESIA AND THE CROCODILE STAYED BEHIND BECAUSE AFRICA WAS THEIR PROPER HOME
I HAVE A FEELING IT ISN'T A FRIENDLY SHIP I AM AFRAID THERE IS MORE TROUBLE COMING TO US JIP WHO WAS LYING NEAR TAKING A NAP IN THE SUN BEGAN TO GROWL AND TALK IN HIS SLEEP
POLYNESIA THEN SLIPPED OUT AT THE BACK OF THE TREE AND FLEW ACROSS TO THE PRISON SHE FOUND GUB GUB POKING HIS NOSE THROUGH THE BARS OF THE WINDOW
WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT NOW COME OVER HERE BY THE LIGHT OH BUT BEFORE I DO ANYTHING YOU MUST FIRST GO DOWN TO THE BEACH AND GET A SHIP READY WITH FOOD IN IT TO TAKE ME ACROSS THE SEA
RIGHT UP TO THE EARS HE HELD IT THERE A LONG TIME SO LONG THAT THE DOCTOR SEEMED TO GET DREADFULLY ANXIOUS AND FIDGETY STANDING FIRST ON ONE LEG AND THEN ON THE OTHER
THEY ALL LOOKED UP AND THERE STREAMING ACROSS THE FACE OF THE MOON
I DON'T BELIEVE THE POOR BOOBY FOUND THE SLEEPING BEAUTY AT ALL SAID JIP THE DOG MOST LIKELY HE KISSED SOME FARMER'S FAT WIFE WHO WAS TAKING A SNOOZE UNDER AN APPLE TREE
FAREWELL FAREWELL CRIED THE PRINCE A THOUSAND THANKS GOOD TRIPSITINKA AND HE SAT DOWN ON THE SEAT AGAIN WITH A SMILE UPON HIS FACE
THAT FOR A LITTLE THEY COVERED THE WHOLE MOON SO IT COULD NOT SHINE AND THE SEA GREW DARK AND BLACK LIKE WHEN A STORM CLOUD PASSES OVER THE SUN
THE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES THAT SPEAK TO THEE I AM HIDING IN A ROSE BUD OH TELL ME FAIRY QUEEN CRIED BUMPO CLASPING HIS HANDS IN JOY
THE SLOWEST HE COULD FIND I SHOULD THINK MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO WIN A RACE IN A SOUP TUREEN AS HOPE TO GET AWAY FROM THEM
BUT THE DOCTOR ASKED HIM NOT TO MAKE SO MUCH NOISE ABOUT IT AND WHEN HE HAD CLOSED HIS MEDICINE BAG IN A HURRY HE TOLD HIM TO OPEN THE PRISON DOOR
IN A SWIFT SHIP AND WHAT SHOULD HE DO ABOUT IT WHEN THE SWALLOWS HEARD THIS THEY ALL CAME DOWN ON TO THE DOCTOR'S SHIP AND THEY TOLD HIM TO UNRAVEL SOME PIECES OF LONG ROPE
THIS COAST IS THE SEASHORE OF THE GREAT DESERT IT IS A WILD LONELY PLACE ALL SAND AND STONES AND IT WAS HERE THAT THE BARBARY PIRATES LIVED THESE PIRATES A BAD LOT OF MEN
AND BEGAN READING THE FAIRY STORIES TO HIMSELF CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA WATCHED HIM KEEPING VERY QUIET AND STILL
WOOF OO WOOF THEN HE BARKED LOUD AND WOKE HIMSELF UP WITH A SURPRISED LOOK ON HIS FACE SEE CRIED DAB DAB THAT BOAT IS NEARER NOW
SHALL SCRUB MY KITCHEN FLOOR FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE SO THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS WERE LED BACK TO PRISON AND LOCKED UP AND THE DOCTOR WAS TOLD THAT IN THE MORNING
ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE EXCEPT THE TREES THE DOCTOR COULD SEE THAT THEY HAD BLUE WINGS AND WHITE BREASTS AND VERY SHORT FEATHERED LEGS
THERE LIES A FAMOUS WIZARD JOHN DOLITTLE BY NAME MANY THINGS HE KNOWS OF MEDICINE AND MAGIC AND MIGHTY DEEDS HAS HE PERFORMED
HE MUST BEGIN SCRUBBING THE KITCHEN FLOOR THEY WERE ALL VERY UNHAPPY THIS IS A GREAT NUISANCE SAID THE DOCTOR
CATCHING HIM AND BRINGING HIM BACK THAT I TURNED TO THE LEFT INSTEAD OF THE RIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE SWAMP SH LOOK THERE'S PRINCE BUMPO COMING INTO THE GARDEN HE MUST NOT SEE US
YOU CAN COUNT ITS THREE BIG SAILS ALL RED WHOEVER IT IS THEY ARE COMING AFTER US I WONDER WHO THEY ARE THEY ARE BAD SAILORS SAID JIP AND THEIR SHIP IS VERY SWIFT
IT IS VERY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU NOW WE NEED NOT BE AFRAID THAT WE WILL LOSE OUR WAY UPON THE SEA PULL UP THE ANCHOR AND SET THE SAIL WHEN THE SHIP MOVED OUT UPON THE WATER
I MUST BE A WHITE PRINCE YOU KNOW IT IS VERY HARD TO CHANGE THE COLOR OF A PRINCE SAID THE DOCTOR ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS A MAGICIAN CAN DO
RANG FROM YONDER BOWER STRANGE WORTHY PRINCE SAID POLYNESIA KEEPING VERY STILL SO BUMPO COULDN'T SEE HER THOU SAYEST WINGED
I HAVE SAID ENOUGH
THE TWELFTH CHAPTER
I SUPPOSE IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE SAID THE DOCTOR LET ME SEE AND HE WENT OVER TO HIS MEDICINE BAG MURMURING SOMETHING ABOUT LIBERATED CHLORINE ON ANIMAL PIGMENT
AND ASKED HER WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM THE DOCTOR AND ALL THE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BY THE KING'S MEN AND LOCKED UP AGAIN WHISPERED POLYNESIA WE LOST OUR WAY IN THE JUNGLE
AND MAKE THEM INTO A LOT OF THIN STRINGS AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD THEN THE ENDS OF THESE STRINGS WERE TIED ON TO THE FRONT OF THE SHIP AND THE SWALLOWS TOOK HOLD OF THE STRINGS WITH THEIR FEET
SAID DAB DAB THE ROAST BEEF MUST BE ON THAT OTHER SHIP OVER THERE BUT THAT'S TEN MILES AWAY SAID THE DOCTOR HE COULDN'T SMELL THAT FAR SURELY OH YES HE COULD SAID DAB DAB
TO AWAKEN HER AS THE BOOK SAID I SHOULD TIS TRUE INDEED THAT SHE AWOKE BUT WHEN SHE SAW MY FACE SHE CRIED OUT OH HE'S BLACK AND SHE RAN AWAY AND WOULDN'T MARRY ME
THE WIDE WIDE SEA LOOKED TERRIBLY BIG AND LONESOME IN THE MOONLIGHT AND HE BEGAN TO WONDER IF THEY WOULD LOSE THEIR WAY WHEN THEY PASSED OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE BEACH THEY SAW POLYNESIA AND CHEE CHEE WAITING FOR THEM ON THE ROCKS NEAR THE SHIP I FEEL SORRY ABOUT BUMPO SAID THE DOCTOR
AND BLUNDERED INTO THE PALACE GARDEN BY MISTAKE BUT COULDN'T YOU GUIDE THEM ASKED CHEE CHEE AND HE BEGAN TO SCOLD THE PARROT FOR LETTING THEM GET LOST WHILE HE WAS AWAY LOOKING FOR THE COCOANUTS
AS SOON AS THEY HAD ALL FOUND A PLACE TO SIT SUDDENLY THERE WAS NO NOISE LEFT ANYWHERE ALL WAS QUIET ALL WAS STILL AND IN THE SILENT MOONLIGHT
AFTERWARDS WHEN THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS WERE GOING ON ALONE POLYNESIA SAID WE MUST TREAD SOFTLY AND TALK LOW AS WE GO THROUGH THE LAND OF THE JOLLIGINKI
HE GROWLED THE WORST MEN I EVER SMELT I SMELL TROUBLE I SMELL A FIGHT SIX BAD SCOUNDRELS FIGHTING AGAINST ONE BRAVE MAN I WANT TO HELP HIM
IT WAS ALL THAT STUPID PIG'S FAULT SAID POLYNESIA HE WOULD KEEP RUNNING OFF THE PATH HUNTING FOR GINGER ROOTS AND I WAS KEPT SO BUSY
STARTED UP OFF THE SEAT AND LOOKED ALL AROUND WHAT IS THIS I HEAR HE CRIED METHOUGHT THE SWEET MUSIC OF A FAIRY'S SILVER VOICE
BUT EVEN WHILE HE WAS WONDERING THEY HEARD A STRANGE WHISPERING NOISE HIGH IN THE AIR COMING THROUGH THE NIGHT AND THE ANIMALS ALL STOPPED SAYING GOOD BY AND LISTENED
TO TURN HIM WHITE BUT BE SURE TO MAKE HIM PROMISE YOU FIRST THAT HE WILL OPEN THE PRISON DOOR AND FIND A SHIP FOR YOU TO CROSS THE SEA IN THIS IS ALL VERY WELL SAID THE DOCTOR
I HAD NO IDEA THAT WE HAD BEEN IN AFRICA SO LONG IT WILL BE NEARLY SUMMER WHEN WE GET HOME FOR THESE ARE THE SWALLOWS GOING BACK SWALLOWS I THANK YOU FOR WAITING FOR US
HE CLIMBED HIGH TREES AND LOOKED OUT FROM THE TOP BRANCHES TO TRY AND SEE THE DOCTOR'S HIGH HAT HE WAVED AND SHOUTED HE CALLED TO ALL THE ANIMALS BY NAME BUT IT WAS NO USE
AND THERE TIED TO THE DOCTOR'S SHIP WERE A THOUSAND STRINGS AND TWO THOUSAND SWALLOWS WERE PULLING ON EACH STRING ALL TERRIBLY SWIFT FLIERS
I SUPPOSE HE IS SAID DAB DAB ALL DOGS CAN SMELL IN THEIR SLEEP BUT WHAT IS HE SMELLING ASKED THE DOCTOR THERE IS NO ROAST BEEF COOKING ON OUR SHIP NO
THEY STILL STOOD THERE UPON THE ROCKS
THE PRINCE LIFTED HIS FACE UP OUT OF THE BASIN BREATHING VERY HARD AND ALL THE ANIMALS CRIED OUT IN SURPRISE FOR THE PRINCE'S FACE HAD TURNED AS WHITE AS SNOW
AND PRESENTLY ALL THESE BIRDS CAME DOWN CLOSE SKIMMING OVER THE WATER AND THE LAND AND THE NIGHT SKY WAS LEFT CLEAR ABOVE AND THE MOON SHONE AS BEFORE
SERVE TO SUPPORT THE PROCESS OF RESPIRATION THE FORMER MAY BE CALLED THE PLASTIC ELEMENTS OF NUTRITION THE LATTER ELEMENTS OF RESPIRATION AMONG THE FORMER WE RECKON
ALREADY CONTAIN EXACTLY THE AMOUNT OF CARBON WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FIBRINE AND ALBUMEN
NATURAL AND EASILY EXPLAINED ON ACCOUNT OF THIS VERY IDENTITY OF COMPOSITION
AND IF WE CAN TRUST TO THE REPORTS OF PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE RESIDED IN THE EAST
GRASPS EACH WHOLE THAT SENSE PRESENTS OR BREAKS INTO ELEMENTS SO DIVIDES AND RECOMBINES AND IN CHANGEFUL WISE NOW TO LOW DESCENDS AND NOW TO THE HEIGHT DOTH RISE
THERE IS ADDED THEREFORE BY MEANS OF THESE COMPOUNDS TO THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF FOOD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CARBON OR AS IN THE CASE OF BUTTER OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN THAT IS AN EXCESS OF ELEMENTS
THE PRECEDING CONSIDERATIONS LEAVE NO DOUBT AS TO THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH NATURE HAS ADDED TO THE FOOD OF THE YOUNG OF CARNIVOROUS MAMMALIA SUBSTANCES DEVOID OF NITROGEN
THIS IS THE VERY MIST OF OPINION NOT THE TRUTH OF KNOWLEDGE
MUCH LESS CARBON AND HYDROGEN IN THE FORM ADAPTED FOR THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS THAN CORRESPOND TO THE OXYGEN TAKEN UP IN THE LUNGS
IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ELEMENTS OF GELATINE OR OF THOSE TISSUES WHICH CONTAIN IT THE GELATINOUS TISSUES THE GELATINE OF THE BONES THE MEMBRANES THE CELLS AND THE SKIN SUFFER IN THE ANIMAL BODY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF OXYGEN AND MOISTURE
HAVE A COMPOSITION IDENTICAL WITH THAT OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD NO NITROGENISED COMPOUND THE COMPOSITION OF WHICH DIFFERS FROM THAT OF FIBRINE ALBUMEN AND CASEINE
THE ROUNDNESS OF A BODY IS RECOGNISED IN ONE WAY BY SIGHT IN ANOTHER BY TOUCH SIGHT LOOKS UPON IT FROM A DISTANCE AS A WHOLE BY A SIMULTANEOUS REFLECTION OF RAYS TOUCH GRASPS THE ROUNDNESS PIECEMEAL
AND THE FREE AND UNIMPEDED DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANS IN THE YOUNG ANIMAL ARE DEPENDENT ON THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN SUBSTANCES WHICH IN THE NUTRITIVE PROCESS HAVE NO OTHER FUNCTION THAN TO PROTECT THE NEWLY FORMED ORGANS FROM THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN
WHICH THESE ANIMALS CONSUME IN THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF THEIR FOOD WHICH BEARS NO PROPORTION WHATEVER TO THE OXYGEN ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN AND LUNGS A HORSE FOR EXAMPLE
SUCH THINGS HOWEVER MUCH FOREKNOWN ARE IN THEIR OCCURRENCE FREE
GIVEN IN A FORM ADAPTED FOR ASSIMILATION THEY SERVE TO HUSBAND THE VITAL FORCE JUST AS MAY BE DONE IN THE CASE OF THE STOMACH BY DUE PREPARATION OF THE FOOD IN GENERAL
MORE INTENSE THAN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION IN THE EXISTING TISSUES IF BOTH PROCESSES WERE EQUALLY ACTIVE THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY COULD NOT INCREASE AND WERE THE WASTE BY TRANSFORMATION GREATER THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY WOULD DECREASE
NOR CAN IMAGINATION BEHOLD UNIVERSAL IDEAS NOR THOUGHT EMBRACE PURE FORM BUT INTELLIGENCE LOOKING DOWN AS IT WERE FROM ITS HIGHER STANDPOINT IN ITS INTUITION OF FORM DISCRIMINATES ALSO THE SEVERAL ELEMENTS WHICH UNDERLIE IT
THAT THE TISSUES YIELDING GELATINE OR CHONDRINE AS FOR EXAMPLE THE GELATINE OF SKIN OR OF BONES ARE NOT ADAPTED FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE VITAL PROCESS FOR THEIR COMPOSITION IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF FIBRINE OR ALBUMEN
BUT SINCE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF ORGANISED PARTS GOES ON MORE SLOWLY THERE WOULD ENSUE A DEFICIENCY OF THOSE SUBSTANCES
MAN IS A TWO LEGGED ANIMAL ENDOWED WITH REASON THIS IS INDEED A UNIVERSAL NOTION YET NO ONE IS IGNORANT THAT THE THING IS IMAGINABLE AND PRESENTABLE TO SENSE BECAUSE THOUGHT CONSIDERS IT NOT BY IMAGINATION OR SENSE
AND TO SEE WHAT FOLLOWS WE ASSUME THAT THERE IS NO FOREKNOWLEDGE ARE WILLED ACTIONS THEN TIED DOWN TO ANY NECESSITY IN THIS CASE CERTAINLY NOT
HYAENA IN THE CAGES OF A MENAGERIE ARE COMPELLED TO ACCELERATE THE WASTE OF THE ORGANISED TISSUES BY INCESSANT MOTION IN ORDER TO FURNISH THE MATTER NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION SO THE SAVAGE FOR THE VERY SAME OBJECT
AND THEIR CONVERSION INTO OXIDISED PRODUCTS FURNISHES THE CLEAREST PROOF THAT FAR MORE OXYGEN IS ABSORBED THAN IS REQUIRED TO CONVERT THE CARBON AND HYDROGEN OF THE METAMORPHOSED TISSUES INTO CARBONIC ACID AND WATER
NO SHADOW OF UNCERTAINTY WOULD REMAIN WITH A VIEW OF MAKING THIS AT LAST CLEAR AND PLAIN I WILL BEGIN BY CONSIDERING THE ARGUMENTS BY WHICH THOU ART SWAYED FIRST
WHICH THEIR ORGANISM CANNOT EMPLOY FOR NUTRITION STRICTLY SO CALLED THAT IS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BLOOD SUBSTANCES WHICH MAY BE ENTIRELY DISPENSED WITH IN THEIR NOURISHMENT IN THE ADULT STATE
THE MOST RECENT AND EXACT RESEARCHES HAVE ESTABLISHED AS A UNIVERSAL FACT TO WHICH NOTHING YET KNOWN IS OPPOSED THAT THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENTS OF VEGETABLE FOOD
ACCORDING TO WHICH A HORSE EXPIRES SEVENTY NINE OZ DAILY CANNOT BE VERY FAR FROM THE TRUTH
HE WOULD BE COMPELLED IF CONFINED TO FLESH ALONE IN ORDER TO PROCURE THE CARBON NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION DURING THE SAME TIME TO CONSUME FIVE SUCH ANIMALS IT IS EASY TO SEE FROM THESE CONSIDERATIONS
ON A LIMITED SPACE IS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF INCREASING ITS NUMBERS BEYOND A CERTAIN POINT WHICH IS SOON ATTAINED THE CARBON NECESSARY FOR RESPIRATION MUST BE OBTAINED FROM THE ANIMALS
NOW THE CIRCULATION IN THE YOUNG ANIMAL IS NOT WEAKER BUT ON THE CONTRARY MORE RAPID THE RESPIRATIONS ARE MORE FREQUENT AND FOR EQUAL BULKS THE CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN MUST BE GREATER RATHER THAN SMALLER IN THE YOUNG THAN IN THE ADULT ANIMAL
THAT GELATINE WHEN TAKEN IN THE DISSOLVED STATE IS AGAIN CONVERTED IN THE BODY INTO CELLULAR TISSUE MEMBRANE AND CARTILAGE
AND FOR THEIR GROWTH AND WHEN THE POWERS OF NUTRITION IN THE WHOLE BODY ARE AFFECTED BY A CHANGE OF THE HEALTH THEN
BECAUSE IN THAT CASE THE PRODUCTS OF THE WASTE OR METAMORPHOSIS OF THE ORGANISED TISSUES
YET NO ONE HAS HAD DILIGENCE AND PERSEVERANCE ENOUGH TO FIND A SOLUTION AND THE REASON OF THIS OBSCURITY IS THAT THE MOVEMENT OF HUMAN REASONING CANNOT COPE
IS FOUNDED UPON THE SENSES NEVERTHELESS SURVEYS SENSE IMPRESSIONS WITHOUT CALLING IN SENSE NOT IN THE WAY OF SENSE PERCEPTION BUT OF IMAGINATION
I INQUIRE INTO THE REASONS WHY THOU ART DISSATISFIED WITH THE SOLUTION PROPOSED WHICH IS TO THE EFFECT THAT
WHEN WE CONSIDER THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ALBUMEN OF THE BLOOD INTO A PART OF AN ORGAN COMPOSED OF FIBRINE THE IDENTITY IN COMPOSITION OF THE TWO SUBSTANCES RENDERS THE CHANGE EASILY CONCEIVABLE INDEED
THE ELEMENTS OF THESE SUBSTANCES UNITE WITH THE OXYGEN THE ORGANS THEMSELVES COULD NOT DO SO WITHOUT BEING CONSUMED THAT IS GROWTH OR INCREASE OF MASS IN THE BODY THE CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN REMAINING THE SAME WOULD BE UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE
THERE ARE MANY THINGS WHICH WE SEE TAKING PLACE BEFORE OUR EYES THE MOVEMENTS OF CHARIOTEERS FOR INSTANCE IN GUIDING AND TURNING THEIR CARS AND SO ON NOW IS ANY ONE OF THESE MOVEMENTS COMPELLED BY ANY NECESSITY NO CERTAINLY NOT
THE FUNCTION PERFORMED IN THE VITAL PROCESS OF THE GRAMINIVORA BY THESE SUBSTANCES IS INDICATED IN A VERY CLEAR AND CONVINCING MANNER WHEN WE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE VERY SMALL RELATIVE AMOUNT OF THE CARBON
THE EYE OF INTELLIGENCE IS YET MORE EXALTED
THEY AGAIN RECEIVE THIS FOOD UNACCOMPANIED BY THOSE COMPOUNDS DESTITUTE OF NITROGEN WHICH DURING THE LIFE OF THE ANIMALS SERVED TO SUPPORT THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS IN SUCH MEN
BUT IT COMPREHENDS THEM IN THE SAME WAY AS IT COMPREHENDS THAT FORM ITSELF WHICH COULD BE COGNIZED BY NO OTHER THAN ITSELF
BUT ALONG WITH THIS NITROGEN
MUST BE DRAWN NOT FROM SIGNS AND LOOSE GENERAL ARGUMENTS BUT FROM SUITABLE AND NECESSARY CAUSES BUT HOW CAN IT BE THAT THINGS FORESEEN SHOULD EVER FAIL TO COME TO PASS
WHICH ARE ADAPTED FOR ASSIMILATION AND RESPIRATION IN THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE SPACE GRAIN AND OTHER NUTRITIOUS VEGETABLES YIELD US NOT ONLY IN STARCH SUGAR AND GUM THE CARBON WHICH PROTECTS OUR ORGANS FROM THE ACTION OF OXYGEN
SUGAR OF MILK HAS A COMPOSITION CLOSELY ALLIED TO THAT OF THE OTHER KINDS OF SUGAR OF STARCH AND OF GUM ALL OF THEM CONTAIN CARBON AND THE ELEMENTS OF WATER THE LATTER PRECISELY IN THE PROPORTION TO FORM WATER
IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SAVAGE STATE OR OF THE WANT OF KNOWLEDGE IN ACCORDANCE WITH WHAT I HAVE ALREADY STATED YOU WILL PERCEIVE THAT THE SUBSTANCES OF WHICH THE FOOD OF MAN IS COMPOSED MAY BE DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES
THE FUNCTION PERFORMED IN THE ANIMAL SYSTEM BY SUBSTANCES DESTITUTE OF NITROGEN
OUT OF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE ADAPTED TO THE FORMATION OF BLOOD ARE FORMED ALL THE ORGANISED TISSUES THE OTHER CLASS OF SUBSTANCES IN THE NORMAL STATE OF HEALTH
MUST BE DIMINISHED AS WELL IN THE STOMACH AS IN ALL OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY IN THIS CONDITION THE UNIFORM EXPERIENCE OF PRACTICAL PHYSICIANS SHOWS THAT GELATINOUS MATTERS IN A DISSOLVED STATE EXERCISE A MOST DECIDED INFLUENCE ON THE STATE OF THE HEALTH
WHICH IS DISTINGUISHED FROM FIBRINE AND ALBUMEN BY ITS GREAT SOLUBILITY AND BY NOT COAGULATING WHEN HEATED THE CHIEF CONSTITUENT OF THE MOTHER'S BLOOD TO CONVERT CASEINE INTO BLOOD NO FOREIGN SUBSTANCE IS REQUIRED AND IN THE CONVERSION OF THE MOTHER'S BLOOD INTO CASEINE
WHAT THEN IS THE USE OF THE BUTTER AND THE SUGAR OF MILK HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THAT THESE SUBSTANCES ARE INDISPENSABLE TO LIFE BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK CONTAIN NO FIXED BASES NO SODA NOR POTASH
MUST GO ON FAR LESS RAPIDLY THAN IN THE CARNIVORA WERE THIS NOT THE CASE A VEGETATION A THOUSAND TIMES MORE LUXURIANT THAN THE ACTUAL ONE WOULD NOT SUFFICE FOR THEIR NOURISHMENT SUGAR GUM AND STARCH WOULD NO LONGER BE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT LIFE IN THESE ANIMALS
THOU BELIEVEST TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SOUNDNESS OF KNOWLEDGE NOW THE CAUSE OF THE MISTAKE IS THIS THAT MEN THINK THAT ALL KNOWLEDGE IS COGNIZED PURELY BY THE NATURE AND EFFICACY OF THE THING KNOWN
NOW THE ANALYSIS OF CASEINE HAS LED TO THE RESULT WHICH AFTER THE DETAILS I HAVE GIVEN CAN HARDLY EXCITE YOUR SURPRISE THAT THIS SUBSTANCE ALSO IS IDENTICAL IN COMPOSITION WITH THE CHIEF CONSTITUENTS OF BLOOD FIBRINE AND ALBUMEN
FOREKNOWLEDGE IS NOT TO BE DEEMED ANY HINDRANCE TO THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL NOW SURELY THE SOLE GROUND ON WHICH THOU ARGUEST THE NECESSITY OF THE FUTURE IS THAT THINGS WHICH ARE FOREKNOWN CANNOT FAIL TO COME TO PASS BUT IF
AND SINCE THESE LAST ARE EXACTLY REPLACED BY THE FOOD TO THE CARBON NITROGEN AND HYDROGEN OF THE FOOD WERE THIS NOT THE CASE THE WEIGHT OF THE ANIMAL COULD NOT POSSIBLY REMAIN UNCHANGED
MUST HAVE UNDERGONE A CHANGE AND MUST HAVE SERVED SOME PURPOSE IN THE ANIMAL ECONOMY IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GELATINE MUST BE EXPELLED FROM THE BODY IN A FORM DIFFERENT FROM THAT IN WHICH IT WAS INTRODUCED AS FOOD
HOW CLOSE THE CONNECTION IS BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN SPECIES THE CULTIVATION OF OUR CROPS HAS ULTIMATELY NO OTHER OBJECT THAN THE PRODUCTION OF A MAXIMUM OF THOSE SUBSTANCES
LET ME NOW APPLY THE PRINCIPLES ANNOUNCED IN THE PRECEDING LETTERS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR OWN SPECIES MAN WHEN CONFINED TO ANIMAL FOOD
EMBRACES IMAGES AND SENSE IMPRESSIONS WITHOUT RESORTING TO IMAGINATION OR SENSE
INTO NITROGENISED AND NON NITROGENISED THE FORMER ARE CAPABLE OF CONVERSION INTO BLOOD THE LATTER ARE INCAPABLE OF THIS TRANSFORMATION
ON THE SMOOTH UNSULLIED WHITE OF THE PAPER'S FACE SO DO OUTER THINGS IMPRESS IMAGES ON CONSCIOUSNESS BUT IF VERILY THE MIND THUS ALL PASSIVE LIES IF NO LIVING POWER WITHIN ITS OWN FORCE SUPPLIES
MY DEAR SIR THE FACTS DETAILED IN MY LAST LETTER WILL SATISFY YOU AS TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE INCREASE OF MASS IN AN ANIMAL THAT IS ITS GROWTH IS ACCOMPLISHED
WHEN CHEMICALLY EXAMINED CASEINE IS FOUND TO CONTAIN A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION OF THE EARTH OF BONES THAN BLOOD DOES AND THAT IN A VERY SOLUBLE FORM CAPABLE OF REACHING EVERY PART OF THE BODY THUS EVEN IN THE EARLIEST PERIOD OF ITS LIFE
BUT THIS THOU WILT SAY IS THE VERY POINT IN DISPUTE WHETHER ANY FOREKNOWING IS POSSIBLE OF THINGS WHOSE OCCURRENCE IS NOT NECESSARY FOR HERE THERE SEEMS TO THEE A CONTRADICTION AND IF THEY ARE FORESEEN THEIR NECESSITY FOLLOWS
AND WOULD NECESSARILY YIELD TO THE ACTION OF THE OXYGEN WERE NOT THE DEFICIENCY OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN SUPPLIED FROM ANOTHER SOURCE THE CONTINUED INCREASE OF MASS OR GROWTH
WITHOUT GOING FURTHER INTO THE CALCULATION IT WILL READILY BE ADMITTED
WHILE IN THE BODY OF A STARVING OR SICK INDIVIDUAL THE FAT DISAPPEARS AND THE MUSCULAR TISSUE TAKES ONCE MORE THE FORM OF BLOOD WE FIND THAT THE TENDONS AND MEMBRANES RETAIN THEIR NATURAL CONDITION
THIS IMPORTANT INQUIRY EXTENDS ALSO TO THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE FOOD OF CARNIVOROUS ANIMALS IN THE EARLIEST PERIODS OF LIFE FOR THIS FOOD ALSO CONTAINS SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE NOT NECESSARY FOR THEIR SUPPORT IN THE ADULT STATE
WHILE ONLY THE BONE EARTH IS FOUND IN HIS EXCREMENTS THE SAME IS TRUE OF MAN WHEN FED ON FOOD RICH IN GELATINE AS FOR EXAMPLE STRONG SOUP THE GELATINE IS NOT TO BE FOUND EITHER IN THE URINE OR IN THE FAECES AND CONSEQUENTLY
NO PART OF EITHER OF WHICH CAN YIELD BLOOD FIBRINE OR ALBUMEN ARE DESTINED FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS AT AN AGE WHEN A GREATER RESISTANCE IS OPPOSED TO THE METAMORPHOSIS OF EXISTING ORGANISMS OR IN OTHER WORDS TO THE PRODUCTION OF COMPOUNDS WHICH
STIRS THE SOUL'S INTELLIGENCE WHEN LIGHT FLASHES ON THE EYE OR SOUND STRIKES THE EAR MIND AROUSED TO DUE RESPONSE MAKES THE MESSAGE CLEAR
LET US ASSUME FOREKNOWLEDGE AGAIN BUT WITHOUT ITS INVOLVING ANY ACTUAL NECESSITY THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL I IMAGINE WILL REMAIN IN COMPLETE INTEGRITY BUT
BUT BY MEANS OF RATIONAL CONCEPTION
AND WHILE THE SAVAGE WITH ONE ANIMAL
THEN SAID SHE THIS DEBATE ABOUT PROVIDENCE IS AN OLD ONE AND IS VIGOROUSLY DISCUSSED BY CICERO IN HIS DIVINATION THOU ALSO HAST LONG AND EARNESTLY PONDERED THE PROBLEM
BRITTLENESS IN THE BONES OF GRAMINIVOROUS ANIMALS IS CLEARLY OWING TO A WEAKNESS IN THOSE PARTS OF THE ORGANISM WHOSE FUNCTION IT IS TO CONVERT THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD INTO CELLULAR TISSUE AND MEMBRANE
THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG ANIMAL ITS MUSCULAR FIBRE CELLULAR TISSUE NERVOUS MATTER AND BONES MUST HAVE DERIVED THEIR ORIGIN FROM THE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENT OF MILK THE CASEINE FOR BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK CONTAIN NO NITROGEN
WHICH IS FORMED FROM THE BLOOD OF THE MOTHER AND EMPLOYED IN YIELDING THE BLOOD OF THE YOUNG ANIMAL THE YOUNG ANIMAL THEREFORE RECEIVES IN THE FORM OF CASEINE
FOR A SIGN ONLY INDICATES SOMETHING WHICH IS DOES NOT BRING TO PASS THAT OF WHICH IT IS THE SIGN WE REQUIRE TO SHOW BEFOREHAND THAT ALL THINGS WITHOUT EXCEPTION HAPPEN OF NECESSITY
IN ANOTHER BY PURE INTELLIGENCE SENSE JUDGES FIGURE CLOTHED IN MATERIAL SUBSTANCE IMAGINATION FIGURE ALONE WITHOUT MATTER THOUGHT TRANSCENDS THIS AGAIN
A PROGRESSIVE ALTERATION A PART OF THESE TISSUES IS SEPARATED AND MUST BE RESTORED FROM THE BLOOD BUT THIS ALTERATION AND RESTORATION ARE OBVIOUSLY CONFINED WITHIN VERY NARROW LIMITS
COMES A DOCTRINE SAGE THAT DOTH LIKEN LIVING MIND TO A WRITTEN PAGE SINCE ALL KNOWLEDGE COMES THROUGH SENSE GRAVEN BY EXPERIENCE AS SAY THEY THE PEN ITS MARKS CURIOUSLY DOTH TRACE
CONFINED TO AN ANIMAL DIET IT IS THE CARBON OF THE FLESH AND OF THE BLOOD WHICH MUST TAKE THE PLACE OF STARCH AND SUGAR
FAT PECTINE STARCH BASSORINE GUM WINE CANE SUGAR BEER GRAPE SUGAR SPIRITS SUGAR OF MILK
EVEN MORE WIDELY EXTENDED THAN THE LION AND TIGER BECAUSE WHEN HE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY HE KILLS WITHOUT EATING A NATION OF HUNTERS
IS FORCED TO MAKE THE MOST LABORIOUS EXERTIONS AND GO THROUGH A VAST AMOUNT OF MUSCULAR EXERCISE HE IS COMPELLED TO CONSUME FORCE MERELY IN ORDER TO SUPPLY MATTER FOR RESPIRATION CULTIVATION IS THE ECONOMY OF FORCE
IS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE VITAL PROCESS IN ANIMALS THE ANIMAL ORGANISM UNQUESTIONABLY POSSESSES THE POWER OF FORMING FROM THE CONSTITUENTS OF ITS BLOOD
GRANTED BUT IN THIS CASE IT IS PLAIN THAT EVEN IF THERE HAD BEEN NO FOREKNOWLEDGE
THE GRAMINIVORA CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THESE SUBSTANCES THEIR FOOD MUST CONTAIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ONE OR MORE OF THEM AND IF THESE COMPOUNDS ARE NOT SUPPLIED DEATH QUICKLY ENSUES
THE ORGANIC FORCE BY WHICH THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD ARE TRANSFORMED INTO CELLULAR TISSUE AND MEMBRANES MUST NECESSARILY BE ENFEEBLED BY SICKNESS IN THE SICK MAN THE INTENSITY OF THE VITAL FORCE ITS POWER TO PRODUCE METAMORPHOSES
THEIR DEVELOPMENT IS DEPENDENT ON THE SUPPLY OF A FLUID WHICH THE BODY OF THE MOTHER SECRETES IN THE SHAPE OF MILK MILK CONTAINS ONLY ONE NITROGENISED CONSTITUENT KNOWN UNDER THE NAME OF CASEINE BESIDES THIS ITS CHIEF INGREDIENTS ARE BUTTER
AS THOU WERT READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE JUST NOW THE FACT OF FOREKNOWLEDGE IMPOSES NO NECESSITY ON THINGS FUTURE WHAT REASON IS THERE FOR SUPPOSING THE RESULTS OF VOLUNTARY ACTION CONSTRAINED TO A FIXED ISSUE SUPPOSE FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT
BUT SURVEYING ALL THINGS SO TO SPEAK UNDER THE ASPECT OF PURE FORM BY A SINGLE FLASH OF INTUITION THOUGHT ALSO
WHEN CONFINED TO ANIMAL FOOD RESPIRES LIKE THE CARNIVORA AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MATTERS PRODUCED BY THE METAMORPHOSIS OF ORGANISED TISSUES AND
THERE WOULD BE NO EFFICACY IN SKILL IF ALL MOTIONS TOOK PLACE PERFORCE THEN THINGS WHICH IN TAKING PLACE ARE FREE FROM ANY NECESSITY AS TO THEIR BEING IN THE PRESENT MUST ALSO BEFORE THEY TAKE PLACE BE ABOUT TO HAPPEN WITHOUT NECESSITY
THE MATERIALS OF THE METAMORPHOSED PARTS ARE GIVEN OFF IN THE FORM OF URINE OF CARBONIC ACID AND OF WATER BUT THE BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK ALSO DISAPPEAR THEY CANNOT BE DETECTED IN THE FAECES THE BUTTER AND SUGAR OF MILK ARE GIVEN OUT IN THE FORM OF CARBONIC ACID AND WATER
NAY MORE A COMPARISON OF ITS PROPERTIES WITH THOSE OF VEGETABLE CASEINE HAS SHOWN THAT THESE TWO SUBSTANCES ARE IDENTICAL IN ALL THEIR PROPERTIES INSOMUCH THAT CERTAIN PLANTS SUCH AS PEAS BEANS AND LENTILS ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THE SAME SUBSTANCE
OTHERWISE IF THERE IS NO SUCH UNIVERSAL NECESSITY NEITHER CAN ANY PRECONCEPTION BE A SIGN OF A NECESSITY WHICH EXISTS NOT
VEGETABLE FIBRINE VEGETABLE ALBUMEN VEGETABLE CASEINE ANIMAL FLESH ANIMAL BLOOD AMONG THE ELEMENTS OF RESPIRATION IN OUR FOOD ARE
THIS FACT PRESUPPOSES
WHEREAS THE CASE IS THE VERY REVERSE ALL THAT IS KNOWN IS GRASPED NOT CONFORMABLY TO ITS OWN EFFICACY BUT RATHER CONFORMABLY TO THE FACULTY OF THE KNOWER
WHEREFORE THERE ARE THINGS WHICH WILL COME TO PASS THE OCCURRENCE OF WHICH IS PERFECTLY FREE FROM NECESSITY AT ALL EVENTS I IMAGINE THAT NO ONE WILL DENY THAT THINGS NOW TAKING PLACE WERE ABOUT TO COME TO PASS BEFORE THEY WERE ACTUALLY HAPPENING
AND THE LIMBS OF THE DEAD BODY THEIR CONNECTIONS WHICH DEPEND ON THE GELATINOUS TISSUES ON THE OTHER HAND WE SEE THAT THE GELATINE OF BONES DEVOURED BY A DOG ENTIRELY DISAPPEARS
THE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN CONSUMED AND AS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE THE AMOUNT OF CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OUT BY THE ANIMAL ARE MUCH GREATER THAN IN THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS IN MAN BUT AN ADULT MAN CONSUMES DAILY ABUT FOURTEEN OZ OF CARBON
AND PRODUCES IN THE ORGANISM THE HEAT WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO LIFE BUT ALSO IN THE FORM OF VEGETABLE FIBRINE ALBUMEN AND CASEINE OUR BLOOD FROM WHICH THE OTHER PARTS OF OUR BODY ARE DEVELOPED MAN
THEIR EXISTENCE DEPENDS ON A SUPPLY OF SUBSTANCES HAVING A COMPOSITION IDENTICAL WITH THAT OF SUGAR OF MILK OR CLOSELY RESEMBLING IT EVERYTHING THAT THEY CONSUME AS FOOD CONTAINS A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF STARCH GUM OR SUGAR MIXED WITH OTHER MATTERS
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IN THE SYSTEM OF THE GRAMINIVORA WHOSE FOOD CONTAINS SO SMALL A PORTION RELATIVELY OF THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE BLOOD THE PROCESS OF METAMORPHOSIS IN EXISTING TISSUES AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR RESTORATION OR REPRODUCTION
THE NITROGEN OF THE URINE AND THE HYDROGEN GIVEN OFF AS AMMONIA AND WATER THESE ELEMENTS TAKEN TOGETHER MUST BE EXACTLY EQUAL IN WEIGHT TO THE CARBON NITROGEN AND HYDROGEN OF THE METAMORPHOSED TISSUES
WERE NOT ABOUT TO HAPPEN INSTEAD OF OUR SUPPOSING THAT ALTHOUGH THEY SHOULD COME TO PASS YET THERE WAS NO NECESSITY INVOLVED IN THEIR OWN NATURE COMPELLING THEIR OCCURRENCE
IN THE YOUNG OF CARNIVOROUS BIRDS THE WANT OF ALL MOTION IS AN OBVIOUS CAUSE OF DIMINISHED WASTE IN THE ORGANISED PARTS HENCE MILK IS NOT PROVIDED FOR THEM THE NUTRITIVE PROCESS IN THE CARNIVORA THUS PRESENTS ITSELF UNDER TWO DISTINCT FORMS
LAST IN INWARD SWIFT REVIEW STRICTLY SIFTS THE FALSE AND TRUE OF THESE AMPLE POTENCIES FITTER CAUSE I WEEN WERE MIND'S SELF THAN MARKS IMPRESSED BY THE OUTER SCENE YET THE BODY THROUGH THE SENSE
THE HORSE RECEIVES RATHER LESS THAN THE FIFTH PART OF THE CARBON WHICH HIS ORGANISM REQUIRES FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS AND WE SEE THAT THE WISDOM OF THE CREATOR HAS ADDED TO HIS FOOD THE FOUR FIFTHS WHICH ARE WANTING
AND WITH GIVEN MEANS TO PRODUCE A MAXIMUM OF FORCE THE UNPROFITABLE EXERTION OF POWER THE WASTE OF FORCE IN AGRICULTURE IN OTHER BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY IN SCIENCE OR IN SOCIAL ECONOMY
BY CONTACT AND ATTACHMENT TO THE SURFACE AND BY ACTUAL MOVEMENT ROUND THE PERIPHERY ITSELF MAN HIMSELF LIKEWISE IS VIEWED IN ONE WAY BY SENSE IN ANOTHER BY IMAGINATION IN ANOTHER WAY AGAIN BY THOUGHT
IF WE NOW CALCULATE
OF WHICH ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER CAN LIVE ON THE SPACE SUPPOSED THESE ANIMALS COLLECT FROM PLANTS THE CONSTITUENTS OF THEIR ORGANS AND OF THEIR BLOOD AND YIELD THEM IN TURN TO THE SAVAGES WHO LIVE BY THE CHASE ALONE
IF THIS BE NOT DONE A PERIOD IS RAPIDLY PUT TO THE FORMATION OF BLOOD AND CONSEQUENTLY TO LIFE THIS CONSIDERATION ENABLES US EASILY TO EXPLAIN HOW IT HAPPENS
IF IT BUT REFLECT AGAIN LIKE A GLASS THINGS FALSE AND VAIN
IN THE ADULT STATE ARE PRODUCED IN QUANTITY AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESPIRATION THE YOUNG ANIMAL RECEIVES THE CONSTITUENTS OF ITS BLOOD IN THE CASEINE OF THE MILK A METAMORPHOSIS OF EXISTING ORGANS GOES ON FOR BILE AND URINE ARE SECRETED
WHEREAS IF THERE IS NO NECESSITY THEY CAN BY NO MEANS BE FOREKNOWN AND THOU THINKEST THAT NOTHING CAN BE GRASPED AS KNOWN UNLESS IT IS CERTAIN BUT IF THINGS WHOSE OCCURRENCE IS UNCERTAIN ARE FOREKNOWN AS CERTAIN
WHICH CANNOT POSSIBLY BE EMPLOYED IN THE PRODUCTION OF BLOOD
WHICH NEITHER GAINS NOR LOSES WEIGHT PERCEPTIBLY FROM DAY TO DAY ITS NOURISHMENT THE WASTE OF ORGANISED TISSUE AND ITS CONSUMPTION OF OXYGEN STAND TO EACH OTHER IN A WELL DEFINED AND FIXED RELATION THE CARBON OF THE CARBONIC ACID GIVEN OFF WITH THAT OF THE URINE
THAN THE FACULTY OF THE THINGS WHICH THEY COGNIZE NOR IS THIS STRANGE FOR SINCE EVERY JUDGMENT IS THE ACT OF THE JUDGE IT IS NECESSARY THAT EACH SHOULD ACCOMPLISH ITS TASK BY ITS OWN NOT BY ANOTHER'S POWER
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANS IN WHICH VITALITY RESIDES IS IN THE CARNIVOROUS ANIMAL DEPENDENT ON THE SUPPLY OF A SUBSTANCE
NOW THAT FOR THE SAKE OF WHICH ANYTHING IS DESIRED ITSELF SEEMS TO BE MOST WISHED FOR FOR INSTANCE IF ANYONE WISHES TO RIDE FOR THE SAKE OF HEALTH HE DOES NOT SO MUCH WISH FOR THE EXERCISE OF RIDING
I GAZED AT THAT PALE FADED LIGHT AND ALL AT ONCE I REMEMBERED THAT GOD WAS NEAR ME BUT I DID NOT KNOW WHAT GOD IS THEN AS I KNOW NOW AND WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT HIM THEN WHICH WAS NEITHER MUCH NOR OFTEN
CANNOT BE IDENTICAL THEREFORE THAT WHICH OF ITS OWN NATURE IS DISTINCT FROM THE HIGHEST GOOD IS NOT ITSELF THE HIGHEST GOOD AN IMPIOUS THOUGHT OF HIM THAN WHOM TIS PLAIN NOTHING CAN BE MORE EXCELLENT
AS THE BENEFIT OF HIS HEALTH SINCE THEN ALL THINGS ARE SOUGHT FOR THE SAKE OF THE GOOD IT IS NOT THESE SO MUCH AS GOOD ITSELF THAT IS SOUGHT BY ALL
AND SHINE IN THINE OWN SPLENDOUR
I SEEM TO HAVE SOME INKLING BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE AT LARGE FROM THEE WHY TRULY THE REASON IS HARD AT HAND
ON AN AXIS AND THE MOON THEREUPON SHOOK HERSELF IN RESPONSE THEN THEY NODDED TO EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT IS ENTIRELY MY OWN OPINION AT LAST THEY BEGAN TO TALK
HE FOLDED ME CLOSE TO HIM AND SAID HUSH RANALD MY BOY HERE I AM YOU ARE QUITE SAFE I NESTLED AS CLOSE TO HIM AS I COULD GO AND WEPT FOR BLESSEDNESS OH PAPA I SOBBED
I TUMBLED AT ONE OF THE DOORS RATHER THAN RAN TO IT I FOUND IT FAST
EVEN THINGS WHICH BY NATURE ARE NOT GOOD ARE DESIRED AS IF THEY WERE TRULY GOOD IF THEY SEEM TO BE SO
BETWEEN THEIR TOPS I SAW ONLY STARS AND DARKNESS I TURNED AND LOOKED BACK INTO THE BARN IT APPEARED A HORRIBLE CAVE FILLED WITH DARKNESS I REMEMBERED THERE WERE RATS IN IT
NAY BY NO MEANS SAID I THEN HAPPINESS MUST CERTAINLY NOT BE SOUGHT IN THESE THINGS WHICH SEVERALLY ARE BELIEVED TO AFFORD SOME ONE OF THE BLESSINGS MOST TO BE DESIRED THEY MUST NOT I ADMIT
HOW ANY SADNESS CAN FIND ENTRANCE INTO SUCH A STATE WHEREFORE I MUST NEEDS ACKNOWLEDGE IT FULL OF JOY AT LEAST IF OUR FORMER CONCLUSIONS ARE TO HOLD THEN FOR THE SAME REASONS
BUT WHAT WAS MY DISMAY TO FIND THAT EVEN WHEN MY HAND WENT OUT INTO SPACE NO LIGHT CAME THROUGH THE OPENING WHAT COULD IT MEAN SURELY I HAD NOT GROWN BLIND WHILE I LAY ASLEEP
AND CONCLUDE THESE THREE TO BE ONE WE MUST IF WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRUTH THINKEST THOU THEN THIS COMBINATION OF QUALITIES TO BE OBSCURE AND WITHOUT DISTINCTION
GOOD THEN IS THE SUM AND SOURCE OF ALL DESIRABLE THINGS THAT WHICH HAS NOT IN ITSELF ANY GOOD EITHER IN REALITY OR IN SEMBLANCE CAN IN NO WISE BE DESIRED CONTRARIWISE
AND THINKS FAME AND RANK ALIKE WORTHLESS WITHOUT POWER BUT THOU SEEST IN HOW MANY WAYS HIS STATE ALSO IS DEFECTIVE SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS THAT HE LACKS NECESSARIES
FOR UNIVERSALLY NOTHING CAN BE BETTER IN NATURE THAN THE SOURCE FROM WHICH IT HAS COME THEREFORE ON MOST TRUE GROUNDS OF REASON WOULD I CONCLUDE THAT WHICH IS THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS TO BE
WHAT IS THAT SAID I IS THERE AUGHT THINKEST THOU AMID THESE MORTAL AND PERISHABLE THINGS WHICH CAN PRODUCE A STATE SUCH AS THIS NAY SURELY NOT
AND MUST PUNISH THEM TO MAKE THEM GOOD WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM NOW IN THE SILENT STARRY NIGHT A YET GREATER TERROR SEIZED ME AND I RAN STUMBLING OVER THE UNEVEN FIELD DOES MY READER
MY IDEA OF HIM WAS NOT LIKE HIM IT WAS MERELY A CONFUSED MIXTURE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FANCIES ABOUT HIM AND MY OWN I HAD NOT LEARNED HOW BEAUTIFUL GOD IS
CERTAINLY NOT RIGHT FOR IF THERE IS ANY FEEBLENESS OF STRENGTH IN ANYTHING IN THIS THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE NEED OF EXTERNAL PROTECTION THAT IS SO ACCORDINGLY
SO IT COMES TO PASS THAT WHENEVER IMPERFECTION IS FOUND IN ANY PARTICULAR THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE A PERFECTION IN RESPECT OF THAT PARTICULAR ALSO FOR WERE THERE NO SUCH PERFECTION
TO WHICH THEY GIVE THE NAME DEDUCTIONS SO WILL I ADD HERE A SORT OF COROLLARY FOR SINCE MEN BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF HAPPINESS WHILE HAPPINESS IS VERY GODSHIP
SO BY PARITY OF REASONING BY ACQUIRING GODSHIP THEY MUST OF NECESSITY BECOME GODS SO EVERY MAN WHO IS HAPPY IS A GOD AND THOUGH IN NATURE GOD IS ONE ONLY YET THERE IS NOTHING TO HINDER THAT VERY MANY
I WAS DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED AT FIRST AND FELT AS IF I WERE BEING SLOWLY STIFLED
METHINKS I SHOULD NEXT SHOW IN WHAT MANNER THIS PERFECTION OF FELICITY IS BUILT UP AND HERE I CONCEIVE IT PROPER TO INQUIRE FIRST WHETHER ANY EXCELLENCE SUCH AS THOU HAST LATELY DEFINED
AND DOWN THEIR EYELIDS WINKED AND WINKED AND THEIR CHEEKS PUCKERED AND RELAXED INCESSANTLY THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE STORM OF EXPRESSION UPON THEIR FACES THEIR VERY NOSES TWISTED AND CURLED
WONDER WHITHER I FLED WHITHER SHOULD I FLY BUT HOME TRUE MISSUS MITCHELL WAS THERE BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER THERE AS WELL EVEN KIRSTY WOULD NOT DO IN THIS TERROR HOME WAS THE ONLY REFUGE
NOT THE TAGUS PRECIOUS SANDS
SINCE NOW THOU HAST SEEN WHAT IS THE FORM OF THE IMPERFECT GOOD AND WHAT THE FORM OF THE PERFECT ALSO
IT NOW REMAINS THAT THOU SHOULDST LEARN FROM WHAT SOURCE TO SEEK THIS YES TO THIS I HAVE LONG BEEN EAGERLY LOOKING FORWARD WELL SINCE AS PLATO MAINTAINS IN THE TIMAEUS
HE PREFERS A MEAN AND LOW ESTATE AND ALSO DENIES HIMSELF MANY PLEASURES DEAR TO NATURE TO AVOID LOSING THE MONEY WHICH HE HAS GAINED BUT AT THIS RATE HE DOES NOT EVEN ATTAIN TO INDEPENDENCE
IT SEEMED AS IF IN THE AGONY OF THEIR TALK THEIR COUNTENANCES WOULD GO TO PIECES FOR THE STARS THEY DARTED ABOUT HITHER AND THITHER GATHERED INTO GROUPS DISPERSED AND FORMED NEW GROUPS
OR IS THERE SOME ONE OF THEM WHICH FORMS THE FULL ESSENCE OF HAPPINESS WHILE ALL THE REST ARE RELATIVE TO THIS I WOULD THOU WOULDST UNFOLD THE WHOLE MATTER TO ME AT LARGE
TO CONSIDER WHERE THE DWELLING PLACE OF THIS HAPPINESS MAY BE THE COMMON BELIEF OF ALL MANKIND AGREES THAT GOD THE SUPREME OF ALL THINGS IS GOOD FOR SINCE NOTHING CAN BE IMAGINED BETTER THAN GOD
LIKE PHOSPHORESCENT SPARKS IN THE SEA FOAM
NO VOICE CAME IN REPLY AND THE PLACE WAS YET MORE SILENT THAN THE NIGHT OR THE HALL HE MUST BE ASLEEP I WAS AFRAID TO CALL LOUDER
HE WOULD NOT BE SUPREME OF ALL THINGS FOR THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE MORE EXCELLENT POSSESSED OF PERFECT GOOD WHICH WOULD SEEM TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE IN PRIORITY AND DIGNITY
I CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND ME AND ALMOST SICK WITH THE MISERY OF A BEING WHERE NO OTHER BEING WAS TO COMFORT IT I GROPED MY WAY TO MY FATHER'S ROOM WHEN I ONCE HAD MY HAND ON HIS DOOR
SHE STARTS WITH WHAT IS WHOLE AND PERFECT AND FALLS AWAY LATER TO THESE FEEBLE AND INFERIOR PRODUCTIONS SO IF THERE IS AS WE SHOWED BEFORE A HAPPINESS OF A FRAIL AND IMPERFECT KIND
FOUND ME FAST ASLEEP ON HIS SO FAST THAT HE UNDRESSED ME AND LAID ME IN THE BED WITHOUT MY ONCE OPENING MY EYES THE MORE STRANGE AS I HAD ALREADY SLEPT SO LONG BUT SORROW IS VERY SLEEPY
ABOVE IT SHONE THE SPEECHLESS STARS NOTHING WAS ALIVE NOTHING WOULD SPEAK I WENT UP THE FEW ROUGH HEWN GRANITE
CLEARLY CANNOT BE SEVERALLY EACH WHAT THE OTHER IS WHEREFORE NEITHER OF THE TWO CAN BE PERFECT SINCE TO EITHER THE OTHER IS WANTING
BEING THYSELF MOST BEAUTIFUL SO THOU THE WORK DIDST FASHION IN THAT FAIR LIKENESS BIDDING IT PUT ON PERFECTION THROUGH THE EXQUISITE PERFECTNESS OF EVERY PART'S CONTRIVANCE
SHOULD BE GODS BY PARTICIPATION IN THAT NATURE A FAIR CONCLUSION AND A PRECIOUS SAID I DEDUCTION OR COROLLARY BY WHICHEVER NAME THOU WILT CALL IT AND YET SAID SHE
AND SINCE HE CANNOT RID HIMSELF OF THESE INCONVENIENCES EVEN CEASES TO HAVE THAT POWER WHICH WAS HIS WHOLE END AND AIM IN LIKE MANNER MAY WE CAST UP THE RECKONING IN CASE OF RANK
THAT WE MUST ADMIT THAT RENOWN IS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER THREE IT DOES SAID I THAT THEN WHICH NEEDS NOTHING OUTSIDE ITSELF WHICH CAN ACCOMPLISH ALL THINGS IN ITS OWN STRENGTH
BUT WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TRUE HAPPINESS IS THE PERFECT GOOD THEREFORE TRUE HAPPINESS MUST DWELL IN THE SUPREME DEITY I ACCEPT THY REASONINGS SAID I
NEARLY UNDER IT WAS THE LIGHT OF THE SUN CREEPING ROUND BY THE NORTH TOWARDS THE SPOT IN THE EAST WHERE HE WOULD RISE AGAIN
BUT DEEP SET WITHIN THY INMOST BEING THE FORM OF PERFECT GOOD FROM ENVY FREE AND THOU DIDST MOULD THE WHOLE TO THAT SUPERNAL PATTERN BEAUTEOUS THE WORLD IN THEE THUS IMAGED
OR HATH IT AS A NATURAL ENDOWMENT IN SUCH SORT THAT THOU MIGHTEST CONSIDER THE ESSENCE OF THE HAPPINESS POSSESSED
THE HIGHEST POWER REVERENCE RENOWN AND PLEASURE WHAT THEN ARE ALL THESE GOODS INDEPENDENCE POWER AND THE REST TO BE DEEMED MEMBERS OF HAPPINESS AS IT WERE
HE DOES INDEED WISH FOR HAPPINESS AS A WHOLE BUT WILL HE FIND IT IN THESE THINGS WHICH AS WE HAVE PROVED
OR WEIGHT OF WATERS WHELM THE EARTH THOU JOINEST AND DIFFUSEST THROUGH THE WHOLE LINKING ACCORDANTLY ITS SEVERAL PARTS A SOUL OF THREEFOLD NATURE MOVING ALL
HITHER COME ALL YE WHOSE MINDS LUST WITH ROSY FETTERS BINDS LUST TO BONDAGE HARD COMPELLING
BUT THE TRUE AND PERFECT GOOD THEY CANNOT BESTOW EVEN SO SAID I SINCE THEN THOU HAST LEARNT WHAT THAT TRUE HAPPINESS IS AND WHAT MEN FALSELY CALL HAPPINESS
ALL THESE HOWEVER HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE THE SAME THEREFORE THEY CANNOT POSSIBLY BE MEMBERS OTHERWISE HAPPINESS WILL SEEM TO BE BUILT UP OUT OF ONE MEMBER WHICH CANNOT BE
AND I IN MY TURN LEARNED THE DISMAY OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHEN I DID NOT APPEAR KIRSTY TOLD WHAT SHE KNEW THEY SEARCHED EVERYWHERE BUT COULD NOT FIND ME AND GREAT AS MY MISERY HAD BEEN
HOW CAN WE DOUBT HIM TO BE GOOD THAN WHOM THERE IS NOTHING BETTER NOW REASON SHOWS GOD TO BE GOOD IN SUCH WISE AS TO PROVE THAT IN HIM IS PERFECT GOOD FOR WERE IT NOT SO
AND AS I SLEPT I DREAMED MY DREAM THE SUN WAS LOOKING VERY GRAVE AND THE MOON REFLECTED HIS CONCERN THEY WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH ME AT LENGTH THE SUN SHOOK HIS HEAD
EMERALD GREEN AND GLISTERING WHITE
SOMETHING MOVED ME TO CLIMB ON THE FORM AND LOOK OUT OF A LITTLE WINDOW FROM WHICH I COULD SEE THE MANSE AND THE ROAD FROM IT TO MY DISMAY THERE WAS MISSUS MITCHELL COMING TOWARDS THE FARM
IS ONE AND THE SAME I CANNOT SEE HOW ANYONE CAN DISSENT FROM THESE CONCLUSIONS
OF GLORY OR OF PLEASURE FOR SINCE EACH ONE OF THESE SEVERALLY IS IDENTICAL WITH THE REST WHOSOEVER SEEKS ANY ONE OF THEM WITHOUT THE OTHERS
MY HEART SANK TOTALLY WITHIN ME I COULD BEAR NO MORE I FELL DOWN ON THE BED WEEPING BITTERLY AND WEPT MYSELF ASLEEP
OF THE HIGHEST GOOD IN WHAT WAY PRAY SAID I DO NOT RASHLY SUPPOSE THAT HE WHO IS THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS HATH RECEIVED THAT HIGHEST GOOD OF WHICH HE IS SAID TO BE POSSESSED EITHER FROM SOME EXTERNAL SOURCE
BUT THEY RATHER LEAVE THE MIND IN ITS NATIVE DARKNESS BLIND FOR THE FAIREST BEAMS THEY SHED IN EARTH'S LOWEST DEPTHS WERE FED BUT THE SPLENDOUR THAT SUPPLIES STRENGTH AND VIGOUR TO THE SKIES
FOR AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR IT IS NOT DARK THERE ALL NIGHT LONG WHEN THE SKY IS UNCLOUDED AWAY IN THE NORTH WAS THE GREAT BEAR I KNEW THAT CONSTELLATION FOR BY IT ONE OF THE MEN HAD TAUGHT ME TO FIND THE POLE STAR
BY NO MEANS THEN CAN GOODS WHICH ARE SUPREME BE DIFFERENT ONE FROM THE OTHER BUT WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT BOTH HAPPINESS AND GOD ARE THE SUPREME GOOD WHEREFORE THAT WHICH IS HIGHEST DIVINITY
WHICH I COULD DRAW BACK THE OPEN DOOR REVEALED THE DARK NIGHT BEFORE ME WAS THE CORNYARD AS WE CALLED IT FULL OF RICKS HUGE AND VERY POSITIVE ALTHOUGH DIM THEY ROSE BETWIXT ME AND THE SKY
IF I HAD HAD ONE LIVING CREATURE NIGH ME IF ONLY THE STUPID CALF WHOSE DULL SLEEPY LOW STARTLED ME SO DREADFULLY AS I STOOD STARING ABOUT ME
I THOUGHT I HAD LOST YOU AND I THOUGHT I HAD LOST YOU MY BOY TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT BETWEEN MY NARRATIVE AND MY REPLIES TO HIS QUESTIONINGS HE HAD SOON GATHERED THE WHOLE STORY
AND SO COMES TO APPEAR SOMEWHAT POOR IN ESTEEM I CANNOT BUT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEING WHAT IT IS THIS UNION OF QUALITIES IS ALSO RIGHT FAMOUS IT FOLLOWS THEN
THAT WHICH IS SIMPLE AND INDIVISIBLE BY NATURE HUMAN ERROR SEPARATES AND TRANSFORMS FROM THE TRUE AND PERFECT TO THE FALSE AND IMPERFECT DOST THOU IMAGINE THAT WHICH LACKETH NOTHING CAN WANT POWER
IN ITS OWN ESSENCE THE HIGHEST GOOD AND MOST JUSTLY SAID I BUT THE HIGHEST GOOD HAS BEEN ADMITTED TO BE HAPPINESS YES THEN SAID SHE
IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED BUT THERE IS ALSO A HAPPINESS SUBSTANTIAL AND PERFECT MOST TRUE IS THY CONCLUSION AND MOST SURE SAID I NEXT
NOT AS MEN CONVERSE BUT BOTH AT ONCE YET EACH LISTENING WHILE EACH SPOKE I HEARD NO WORD BUT THEIR LIPS MOVED MOST BUSILY THEIR EYEBROWS WENT UP
AND THIS THOU HAST SO AMPLY DEMONSTRATED THAT NO WORD MORE IS NEEDED WELL THEN THESE THINGS SEEM TO GIVE TO MORTALS SHADOWS OF THE TRUE GOOD OR SOME KIND OF IMPERFECT GOOD
DOES NOT EVEN LAY HOLD OF THAT ONE WHICH HE MAKES HIS AIM WELL SAID I WHAT THEN SUPPOSE ANYONE DESIRE TO OBTAIN THEM TOGETHER
REFLECT ALSO SAID SHE WHETHER THE SAME CONCLUSION IS NOT FURTHER CONFIRMED BY CONSIDERING THAT THERE CANNOT BE TWO SUPREME GOODS DISTINCT ONE FROM THE OTHER FOR THE GOODS WHICH ARE DIFFERENT
I STRETCHED OUT MY HANDS TO FEEL FOR HIM
WE OUGHT EVEN IN THE MOST TRIVIAL MATTERS TO IMPLORE THE DIVINE PROTECTION WHAT THINKEST THOU SHOULD WE NOW DO IN ORDER TO DESERVE TO FIND THE SEAT OF THAT HIGHEST GOOD
THE SOURCE OF ALL THINGS GOOD FOR EVERYTHING WHICH IS CALLED IMPERFECT IS SPOKEN OF AS IMPERFECT BY REASON OF THE PRIVATION OF SOME PERFECTION
OR ARE THEY ALL RELATIVE TO GOOD AS TO THEIR SUMMIT AND CROWN I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM BUT I DESIRE TO HEAR HOW THOU WOULDST SOLVE IT WELL THEN LISTEN TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE MATTER
AND THE UNIVERSE CONTROLS
THOU WILT STRAIGHTWAY SEE THE TRUE HAPPINESS I PROMISED
THIS ALSO IS NECESSARY THAT INDEPENDENCE POWER RENOWN REVERENCE AND SWEETNESS OF DELIGHT ARE DIFFERENT ONLY IN NAME BUT IN SUBSTANCE DIFFER NO WISE ONE FROM THE OTHER
WHY SEEING HAPPINESS HAS MANY PARTICULARS INCLUDED UNDER IT SHOULD ALL THESE BE REGARDED AS FORMING ONE BODY OF HAPPINESS AS IT WERE MADE UP OF VARIOUS PARTS
THESE BY A LAW BENIGN THOU BIDDEST TURN AGAIN
IT IS MANIFEST THAT THEY BECOME HAPPY BY THE ACQUISITION OF GODSHIP BUT AS BY THE ACQUISITION OF JUSTICE MEN BECOME JUST AND WISE BY THE ACQUISITION OF WISDOM
OVER WHOSE DEFEAT HOWEVER I REJOICED WITH THE PRIDE OF A DRAGON SLAYER
AND FORTHWITH LIFTED UP HER VOICE AND SANG
HERE SHALL BE YOUR LABOUR'S CLOSE HERE YOUR HAVEN OF REPOSE COME TO YOUR ONE REFUGE PRESS WIDE IT STANDS TO ALL DISTRESS
I CLIMBED UP ON THE BED I FELT ALL ACROSS IT UTTER DESERTION SEIZED MY SOUL MY FATHER WAS NOT THERE WAS IT A HORRIBLE DREAM SHOULD I EVER AWAKE
WERE ALL THESE MEMBERS COMPOSING HAPPINESS THEY WOULD DIFFER SEVERALLY ONE FROM THE OTHER FOR THIS IS THE NATURE OF PARTS
AND HAVING NO FACES YET BUT BEING A SORT OF CELESTIAL TADPOLES INDICATED BY THEIR MOTIONS ALONE THAT THEY TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE QUESTIONS AGITATING THEIR PARENTS SOME OF THEM KEPT DARTING UP AND DOWN THE LADDER OF RAYS
ALONE THERE LAY THE AWFULNESS OF IT I HAD NEVER BEFORE KNOWN WHAT THE NIGHT WAS THE REAL STING OF ITS FEAR LAY IN THIS THAT THERE WAS NOBODY ELSE IN IT
TIS PLAIN TO THE BLIND SAID I THOU DIDST POINT IT OUT EVEN NOW IN SEEKING TO UNFOLD THE CAUSES OF THE FALSE
NO CONCLUSION COULD BE MORE TRUE SO THEN THE FORM AND THE CAUSES OF FALSE HAPPINESS ARE SET BEFORE THINE EYES NOW TURN THY GAZE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE
I WAS IN DARKNESS BUT NOT IN MY OWN BED WHEN I PROCEEDED TO TURN I FOUND MYSELF HEMMED IN ON ALL SIDES I COULD NOT STRETCH MY ARMS AND THERE WAS HARDLY ROOM FOR MY BODY BETWEEN MY FEET AND MY HEAD
THE AWFUL VAULT OF HEAVEN OVER MY HEAD AND THOSE SHADOWY RICKS AROUND ME IT WAS A RELIEF TO LAY MY HAND ON ONE OF THEM AND FEEL THAT IT WAS SOLID I HALF GROPED MY WAY THROUGH THEM
THE NATURE OF INDEPENDENCE AND POWER IS ONE AND THE SAME IT SEEMS SO WELL BUT DOST THINK THAT ANYTHING OF SUCH A NATURE AS THIS CAN BE LOOKED UPON WITH CONTEMPT
THIS CLEFT IN TWAIN AND IN TWO CIRCLES GATHERED SPEEDS IN A PATH THAT ON ITSELF RETURNS ENCOMPASSING MIND'S LIMITS AND CONFORMS THE HEAVENS TO HER TRUE SEMBLANCE
IT IS NECESSARY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GOD IS VERY HAPPINESS YES SAID I I CANNOT GAINSAY MY FORMER ADMISSIONS AND I SEE CLEARLY THAT THIS IS A NECESSARY INFERENCE THEREFROM
IT IS UTTERLY INCONCEIVABLE HOW THAT SO CALLED IM PERFECTION SHOULD COME INTO EXISTENCE NATURE DOES NOT MAKE A BEGINNING WITH THINGS MUTILATED AND IMPERFECT
WHICH ON ANOTHER SIDE BOUNDED THE CORN YARD THERE WAS THE MOON CRESCENT AS I SAW HER IN MY DREAM BUT LOW DOWN TOWARDS THE HORIZON AND LYING ALMOST UPON HER ROUNDED BACK SHE LOOKED VERY DISCONSOLATE AND DIM
CAN EXIST IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LEST WE BE DECEIVED BY AN EMPTY FICTION OF THOUGHT TO WHICH NO TRUE REALITY ANSWERS
INDEED SAID I I SEE CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT NEITHER IS INDEPENDENCE TO BE FOUND IN WEALTH NOR POWER IN SOVEREIGNTY NOR REVERENCE IN DIGNITIES NOR FAME IN GLORY NOR TRUE JOY IN PLEASURES
THEY CANNOT IN ANY WISE BE DISPUTED BUT COME SEE HOW STRICTLY AND INCONTROVERTIBLY THOU MAYST PROVE THIS OUR ASSERTION
I RECALLED THE HORRIBLE SCHOOL
I DREW NEARER THE PLACE OF POSSIBLE REFUGE ROSE BEFORE ME I STOOD ON THE GRASS PLOT IN FRONT OF IT THERE WAS NO LIGHT IN ITS EYES ITS MOUTH WAS CLOSED IT WAS SILENT AS ONE OF THE RICKS
THAT IS TRUE AND PERFECT HAPPINESS WHICH CROWNS ONE WITH THE UNION OF INDEPENDENCE POWER REVERENCE RENOWN AND JOY AND TO PROVE TO THEE WITH HOW DEEP AN INSIGHT I HAVE LISTENED SINCE ALL THESE ARE THE SAME
FOUND THAT THE SUN WAS GOING DOWN I HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED THAT I WAS GETTING HUNGRY I WENT OUT AT THE OTHER DOOR INTO THE CLOSE OR FARMYARD AND RAN ACROSS TO THE HOUSE NO ONE WAS THERE
WE MUST INVOKE THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS SAID I FOR WITHOUT THIS NO ENTERPRISE SETS OUT FROM A RIGHT BEGINNING
I HAD SOON DRAWN THE STOPPER OF STRAW INTO THE MOUTH OF THE HOLE WHERE HEARING NO ONE APPROACH I BEGAN TO EAT MY OATCAKE AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN BEFORE I HAD FINISHED
IT IS SAID I THIS THEN WHICH IS ONE AND SIMPLE BY NATURE HUMAN PERVERSITY SEPARATES AND IN TRYING TO WIN A PART OF THAT WHICH HAS NO PARTS
WAS WE AGREED HAPPINESS WHEREFORE THUS ALSO IT APPEARS THAT IT IS HAPPINESS ALONE WHICH IS SOUGHT FROM ALL WHICH IT IS TRANSPARENTLY CLEAR THAT THE ESSENCE OF ABSOLUTE GOOD AND OF HAPPINESS
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THAT SAID I BUT I AM IMPATIENT TO HEAR WHAT REMAINS WHY IT IS MANIFEST THAT ALL THE OTHERS ARE RELATIVE TO THE GOOD
THAT WHICH CAN TRULY BESTOW ONE OF THEM I KNOW TO BE WITHOUT DOUBT FULL AND COMPLETE HAPPINESS HAPPY ART THOU MY SCHOLAR IN THIS THY CONVICTION ONLY ONE THING SHOULDST THOU ADD

THE LEWIS AND CLARK CLUB OF PITTSBURGH HAS IN ITS CONSTITUTION AS SECTION THREE OF ARTICLE THREE THE FOLLOWING COMPREHENSIVE PRINCIPLE THE TERM LEGITIMATE SPORT
YOU UNSUSPECTING FEEL FOR ME ALMOST A LONELINESS
THIRTEEN THE KILLING OF AN ANIMAL MEANS THE END OF ITS MOST INTERESTING PERIOD WHEN THE COUNTRY IS FINE PURSUIT IS MORE INTERESTING THAN POSSESSION FOURTEEN
AND THERE WERE NO WILDERNESS GAME PRESERVES IN THOSE DAYS GENTLEMEN SHOT FEMALE HOOFED GAME TRAPPED BEARS IF THEY FELT LIKE IT
WE TRUST IN PLUMED PROCESSION FOR SUCH THE ANGELS GO RANK AFTER RANK WITH EVEN FEET AND UNIFORMS OF SNOW
T IS THE MAJORITY IN THIS AS ALL PREVAILS ASSENT AND YOU ARE SANE DEMUR YOU'RE STRAIGHTWAY DANGEROUS AND HANDLED WITH A CHAIN
AND THIS BEQUEST OF WINGS WAS BUT A BOOK WHAT LIBERTY A LOOSENED SPIRIT BRINGS
AND BY NO MEANS IS IT REALLY NECESSARY TO A SUCCESSFUL OUTING TWELVE THE BEST HUNTER IS THE MAN WHO FINDS THE MOST GAME KILLS THE LEAST AND LEAVES BEHIND HIM NO WOUNDED ANIMALS
WHOSE FARTHEST OF DEGREE WAS THAT SHE MIGHT SOME DISTANT HEAVEN DWELL TIMIDLY WITH THEE

A PARTICULARLY FINE PHOTOGRAPH OF A LARGE WILD ANIMAL IN ITS HAUNTS IS ENTITLED TO MORE CREDIT THAN THE DEAD TROPHY OF A SIMILAR ANIMAL AN ANIMAL THAT HAS BEEN PHOTOGRAPHED NEVER SHOULD BE KILLED UNLESS PREVIOUSLY WOUNDED IN THE CHASE
AND SO THE WALLS DON'T TELL NONE WILL A PAIR OF SPECTACLES AJAR JUST STIR AN ALMANAC'S AWARE WAS IT THE MAT WINKED
A MODUS VIVENDI WORTH WHILE PRIOR TO NINETEEN O EIGHT NO EFFORT SO FAR AS WE ARE AWARE EVER HAD BEEN MADE TO PROMOTE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE AND UP TO DATE CODE OF ETHICS FOR SPORTSMEN WHO SHOOT
THE SALE OF GAME IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PERPETUAL PRESERVATION OF A PROPER STOCK OF GAME
OFTEN IN VIOLATION OF LOCAL LAWS AND ALWAYS TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE PROTECTION OF GAME FOR LEGITIMATE SPORT THE LEWIS AND CLARK CLUB CONDEMNS THE PURCHASE OR THE SALE OF THE HEADS OR HORNS OF ANY GAME
TOO LATE FOR STRIVING FINGERS THAT PASSED AN HOUR AGO
BUT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THESE IS VERY FEW
BEYOND THE NARROW LIMITS COMPATIBLE WITH HIGH CLASS SPORTSMANSHIP SEVEN A GAME BUTCHER
I'M CEDED I'VE STOPPED BEING THEIRS THE NAME THEY DROPPED UPON MY FACE WITH WATER IN THE COUNTRY CHURCH IS FINISHED USING NOW AND THEY CAN PUT IT WITH MY DOLLS MY CHILDHOOD AND THE STRING OF SPOOLS I'VE FINISHED THREADING TOO
THE KILLING OF A FEMALE HOOFED ANIMAL SAVE FOR SPECIAL PRESERVATION IS TO BE REGARDED AS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE HIGHEST SPORTSMANSHIP AND IT SHOULD EVERYWHERE BE PROHIBITED BY STRINGENT LAWS FIFTEEN
AND LIFE HATH IMMORTALITY THIS DOST THOU DOUBT SWEET THEN HAVE I NOTHING TO SHOW BUT CALVARY
WHEN THE HILLS DO FALTER WHEN THE SUN QUESTION IF HIS GLORY BE THE PERFECT ONE SURFEIT
THOUGH MY NAME RANG LOUDEST ON THE HEAVENLY FAME AND WERE YOU SAVED AND I CONDEMNED TO BE WHERE YOU WERE NOT THAT SELF WERE HELL TO ME SO WE MUST KEEP APART YOU THERE I HERE
I COUNT IT AS RATHER STRANGE THAT AMERICAN AND ENGLISH SPORTSMEN
CODE OF ETHICS OF THE CAMP FIRE CLUB OF AMERICA PROPOSED BY WM T HORNADAY AND ADOPTED DECEMBER TENTH NINETEEN O EIGHT ONE
CAME TO CONTINENTS OF SUMMER TO FIRMAMENTS OF SUN TO STRANGE BRIGHT CROWDS OF FLOWERS AND BIRDS OF FOREIGN TONGUE I SAY AS IF THIS LITTLE FLOWER TO EDEN WANDERED IN WHAT THEN
THE WILD ANIMAL LIFE OF TO DAY IS NOT OURS TO DO WITH AS WE PLEASE THE ORIGINAL STOCK IS GIVEN TO US IN TRUST FOR THE BENEFIT BOTH OF THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE WE MUST RENDER AN ACCOUNTING OF THIS TRUST TO THOSE WHO COME AFTER US
THEY ALL LAPSED INTO SILENCE AND WERE SOON ASLEEP ONE THING THE EPISODE HAD ACCOMPLISHED WAS TO ASSURE ME OF SOLA'S FRIENDLINESS TOWARD THE POOR GIRL AND ALSO TO CONVINCE ME THAT I HAD BEEN EXTREMELY FORTUNATE IN FALLING INTO HER HANDS RATHER THAN THOSE OF SOME OF THE OTHER FEMALES
AS SOLA AND I ENTERED THE PLAZA A SIGHT MET MY EYES WHICH FILLED MY WHOLE BEING WITH A GREAT SURGE OF MINGLED HOPE FEAR EXULTATION AND DEPRESSION AND YET MOST DOMINANT WAS A SUBTLE SENSE OF RELIEF AND HAPPINESS
WROUGHT BY THE MOONLIGHT INTO A MIRACLE OF SOFT SPLENDOR AND WONDROUS ENCHANTMENT FEW WESTERN WONDERS ARE MORE INSPIRING THAN THE BEAUTIES OF AN ARIZONA MOONLIT LANDSCAPE THE SILVERED MOUNTAINS IN THE DISTANCE
AFTER THEY HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT IT WAS CUSTOMARY FOR THE ADULTS TO CARRY ON A DESULTORY CONVERSATION FOR A SHORT TIME BEFORE LAPSING INTO SLEEP AND NOW THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE I WAS ALWAYS A KEEN LISTENER ALTHOUGH I NEVER PROFFERED ANY REMARKS MYSELF
BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE STILL WAS TOO HIGH FOR THEM TO HOPE TO REACH HER DECKS FROM MY VANTAGE POINT IN THE WINDOW I COULD SEE THE BODIES OF HER CREW STREWN ABOUT ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHAT MANNER OF CREATURES THEY MIGHT BE
SUDDENLY A LOW BUT DISTINCT MOANING SOUND ISSUED FROM THE RECESSES OF THE CAVE BEHIND ME AND AS IT REACHED THE EARS OF THE INDIANS THEY TURNED AND FLED IN TERROR PANIC STRICKEN SO FRANTIC WERE THEIR EFFORTS TO ESCAPE FROM THE UNSEEN THING BEHIND ME
AND SAVAGE EYES LOOKED INTO MINE THAT HE COULD SEE ME IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THE CAVE I WAS SURE FOR THE EARLY MORNING SUN WAS FALLING FULL UPON ME THROUGH THE OPENING THE FELLOW INSTEAD OF APPROACHING MERELY STOOD AND STARED
AND THE PEOPLES WERE AS SOFT AS THE STUFF THEY SAILED UPON IN OUR DAY WE HAVE PROGRESSED TO A POINT WHERE SUCH SENTIMENTS MARK WEAKNESS AND ATAVISM IT WILL NOT BE WELL FOR YOU TO PERMIT TARS TARKAS TO LEARN THAT YOU HOLD SUCH DEGENERATE SENTIMENTS
IT WAS AN EFFORT OF THE MIND OF THE WILL OF THE NERVES NOT MUSCULAR FOR I COULD NOT MOVE EVEN SO MUCH AS MY LITTLE FINGER BUT NONE THE LESS MIGHTY FOR ALL THAT AND THEN SOMETHING GAVE THERE WAS A MOMENTARY FEELING OF NAUSEA
UPON THE UPPER WORKS AND UPON THE STEERING GEAR AND PROPELLERS TWENTY MINUTES AFTER THE FIRST VOLLEY THE GREAT FLEET SWUNG TRAILING OFF IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH IT HAD FIRST APPEARED SEVERAL OF THE CRAFT WERE LIMPING PERCEPTIBLY
AND THEN COMMENCED A SYSTEMATIC RIFLING OF THE VESSEL THIS OPERATION REQUIRED SEVERAL HOURS DURING WHICH TIME A NUMBER OF THE CHARIOTS WERE REQUISITIONED TO TRANSPORT THE LOOT WHICH CONSISTED IN ARMS AMMUNITION SILKS FURS JEWELS STRANGELY CARVED STONE VESSELS
AND YET HERE I STOOD BUT NAKED AS AT THE MINUTE OF MY BIRTH THE TRANSITION HAD BEEN SO SUDDEN AND SO UNEXPECTED THAT IT LEFT ME FOR A MOMENT FORGETFUL OF AUGHT ELSE THAN MY STRANGE METAMORPHOSIS MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS
EACH CARRIED A STRANGE BANNER SWUNG FROM STEM TO STERN ABOVE THE UPPER WORKS AND UPON THE PROW OF EACH WAS PAINTED SOME ODD DEVICE THAT GLEAMED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND SHOWED PLAINLY EVEN AT THE DISTANCE AT WHICH WE WERE FROM THE VESSELS
AS THE EMPTYING OF THE CONTENTS OF VARIOUS CARBOYS UPON THE DEAD BODIES OF THE SAILORS AND OVER THE DECKS AND WORKS OF THE VESSEL THIS OPERATION CONCLUDED THEY HASTILY CLAMBERED OVER HER SIDES SLIDING DOWN THE GUY ROPES TO THE GROUND
WHILE THE BANNERS AND UPPER WORKS DISSOLVED IN SPURTS OF FLAME AS THE IRRESISTIBLE PROJECTILES OF OUR WARRIORS MOWED THROUGH THEM THE FIRE FROM THE VESSELS WAS MOST INEFFECTUAL OWING AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED
NOT A SIGN OF LIFE WAS MANIFEST UPON HER AS SHE DRIFTED SLOWLY WITH THE LIGHT BREEZE IN A SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION SHE WAS DRIFTING SOME FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE GROUND
BUT WHY I SHOULD RETAIN MY MENTAL FACULTIES AND YET BE UNABLE TO MOVE I COULD NOT FATHOM I LAY FACING THE OPENING OF THE CAVE AND WHERE I COULD SEE THE SHORT STRETCH OF TRAIL WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE CAVE AND THE TURN OF THE CLIFF AROUND WHICH THE TRAIL LED
WHICH LAY JUST WITHIN MY RANGE OF VISION UPON THE LEDGE WHERE I HAD PLACED IT IN THE EARLY MORNING FROM THEN UNTIL POSSIBLY MIDNIGHT ALL WAS SILENCE THE SILENCE OF THE DEAD THEN SUDDENLY THE AWFUL MOAN OF THE MORNING BROKE UPON MY STARTLED EARS
MY BREATH WAS COMING IN QUICK SHORT GASPS COLD SWEAT STOOD OUT FROM EVERY PORE OF MY BODY AND THE ANCIENT EXPERIMENT OF PINCHING REVEALED THE FACT THAT I WAS ANYTHING OTHER THAN A WRAITH
AND A BEARING AT ONCE RESPECTFUL AND MENACING LATER SOLA WITH THE AID OF SEVERAL OF THE OTHER WOMEN REMODELED THE TRAPPINGS TO FIT MY LESSER PROPORTIONS AND AFTER THEY COMPLETED THE WORK I WENT ABOUT GARBED IN ALL THE PANOPLY OF WAR
I CLOSED MY EYES STRETCHED OUT MY ARMS TOWARD THE GOD OF MY VOCATION AND FELT MYSELF DRAWN WITH THE SUDDENNESS OF THOUGHT THROUGH THE TRACKLESS IMMENSITY OF SPACE
EACH FACE WAS THE PICTURE OF AWE AND FEAR BUT FOR WHAT REASON I DID NOT KNOW NOR DID I LEARN UNTIL TEN YEARS LATER THAT THERE WERE STILL OTHER BRAVES BEHIND THOSE WHO REGARDED ME WAS APPARENT FROM THE FACT THAT THE LEADERS PASSED BACK WHISPERED WORD TO THOSE BEHIND THEM
THE DARK AND ANCIENT ISS WHICH CARRIES US TO AN UNKNOWN BUT AT LEAST NO MORE FRIGHTFUL AND TERRIBLE EXISTENCE FORTUNATE INDEED IS HE WHO MEETS HIS END IN AN EARLY DEATH SAY WHAT YOU PLEASE TO TARS TARKAS
I ATTEMPTED TO SPRING TO MY FEET BUT WAS HORRIFIED TO DISCOVER THAT MY MUSCLES REFUSED TO RESPOND TO MY WILL I WAS NOW THOROUGHLY AWAKE BUT AS UNABLE TO MOVE A MUSCLE AS THOUGH TURNED TO STONE IT WAS THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME
AS THE CRAFT NEARED THE BUILDING AND JUST BEFORE SHE STRUCK THE MARTIAN WARRIORS SWARMED UPON HER FROM THE WINDOWS AND WITH THEIR GREAT SPEARS EASED THE SHOCK OF THE COLLISION
AFTER THE LAST LOAD HAD BEEN REMOVED THE WARRIORS MADE LINES FAST TO THE CRAFT AND TOWED HER FAR OUT INTO THE VALLEY IN A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION A FEW OF THEM THEN BOARDED HER AND WERE BUSILY ENGAGED IN WHAT APPEARED FROM MY DISTANT POSITION
THE ENTIRE CAVALCADE OF CHARIOTS MASTODONS AND MOUNTED WARRIORS WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN SOLA AND I HAD ENTERED A BUILDING UPON THE FRONT OF THE CITY IN FACT THE SAME ONE IN WHICH I HAD HAD MY ENCOUNTER WITH THE APES AND WISHING TO SEE WHAT HAD CAUSED THE SUDDEN RETREAT
BUT ARE ALSO THE ARTISANS WHO PRODUCE EVERY MANUFACTURED ARTICLE WROUGHT BY THE GREEN MARTIANS THEY MAKE THE POWDER THE CARTRIDGES THE FIREARMS IN FACT EVERYTHING OF VALUE IS PRODUCED BY THE FEMALES IN TIME OF ACTUAL WARFARE THEY FORM A PART OF THE RESERVES
I COULD SEE THEM EXAMINING THE DEAD SAILORS EVIDENTLY FOR SIGNS OF LIFE AND PRESENTLY A PARTY OF THEM APPEARED FROM BELOW DRAGGING A LITTLE FIGURE AMONG THEM THE CREATURE WAS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN HALF AS TALL AS THE GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS
THE STRANGE LIGHTS AND SHADOWS UPON HOG BACK AND ARROYO AND THE GROTESQUE DETAILS OF THE STIFF YET BEAUTIFUL CACTI FORM A PICTURE AT ONCE ENCHANTING AND INSPIRING AS THOUGH ONE WERE CATCHING FOR THE FIRST TIME A GLIMPSE OF SOME DEAD AND FORGOTTEN WORLD
TO THE UNEXPECTED SUDDENNESS OF THE FIRST VOLLEY WHICH CAUGHT THE SHIP'S CREWS ENTIRELY UNPREPARED AND THE SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE GUNS UNPROTECTED FROM THE DEADLY AIM OF OUR WARRIORS
I REALIZED I HAD NOT ANSWERED HER SIGNAL AND IGNORANT AS I WAS OF MARTIAN CUSTOMS I INTUITIVELY FELT THAT SHE HAD MADE AN APPEAL FOR SUCCOR AND PROTECTION WHICH MY UNFORTUNATE IGNORANCE HAD PREVENTED ME FROM ANSWERING
AND TO FULLY UNDERSTAND PRACTICALLY ALL THAT I HEARD AT THIS TIME OUR SLEEPING QUARTERS WERE OCCUPIED BY THREE OR FOUR FEMALES AND A COUPLE OF THE RECENTLY HATCHED YOUNG BESIDE SOLA AND HER YOUTHFUL WARD MYSELF AND WOOLA THE HOUND
CONVINCED ME THAT THE NOISES I HAD HEARD MUST HAVE RESULTED FROM PURELY NATURAL AND HARMLESS CAUSES
AND FOLLOWED THE RETREATING ARMADA WITH A CONTINUOUS FUSILLADE OF DEADLY FIRE ONE BY ONE HOWEVER THE SHIPS MANAGED TO DIP BELOW THE CRESTS OF THE OUTLYING HILLS UNTIL ONLY ONE BARELY MOVING CRAFT WAS IN SIGHT
I HAD NO DESIRE TO FACE THE UNSEEN THING WHICH MENACED ME MY REVOLVERS WERE STRAPPED TO MY LIFELESS BODY WHICH FOR SOME UNFATHOMABLE REASON I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO TOUCH MY CARBINE WAS IN ITS BOOT STRAPPED TO MY SADDLE
AND EXHIBIT HER LAST AGONIES AT THE GREAT GAMES BEFORE TAL HAJUS REPLIED SARKOJA WHAT WILL BE THE MANNER OF HER GOING OUT INQUIRED SOLA SHE IS VERY SMALL AND VERY BEAUTIFUL I HAD HOPED THAT THEY WOULD HOLD HER FOR RANSOM
IN THE DARKNESS OF THE CAVE AND TO MY DISTORTED IMAGINATION TO BE CREEPING STEALTHILY UPON ME UNABLE LONGER TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO ESCAPE THIS HORRIBLE PLACE I LEAPED QUICKLY THROUGH THE OPENING INTO THE STARLIGHT OF A CLEAR ARIZONA NIGHT
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON MY HORSE WHICH HAD BEEN STANDING WITH DRAGGING REIN BEFORE THE CAVE STARTED SLOWLY DOWN THE TRAIL EVIDENTLY IN SEARCH OF FOOD AND WATER AND I WAS LEFT ALONE WITH MY MYSTERIOUS UNKNOWN COMPANION AND THE DEAD BODY OF MY FRIEND
THAT I NOTICED A SLIGHT VAPOR FILLING THE CAVE IT WAS EXTREMELY TENUOUS AND ONLY NOTICEABLE AGAINST THE OPENING WHICH LED TO DAYLIGHT THERE ALSO CAME TO MY NOSTRILS A FAINTLY PUNGENT ODOR AND I COULD ONLY ASSUME THAT I HAD BEEN OVERCOME BY SOME POISONOUS GAS
THAT ONE OF THE BRAVES WAS HURLED HEADLONG FROM THE CLIFF TO THE ROCKS BELOW THEIR WILD CRIES ECHOED IN THE CANYON FOR A SHORT TIME AND THEN ALL WAS STILL ONCE MORE THE SOUND WHICH HAD FRIGHTENED THEM WAS NOT REPEATED
AS I CAME BACK TO MYSELF I GLANCED AT SOLA WHO HAD WITNESSED THIS ENCOUNTER AND I WAS SURPRISED TO NOTE A STRANGE EXPRESSION UPON HER USUALLY EXPRESSIONLESS COUNTENANCE WHAT HER THOUGHTS WERE I DID NOT KNOW FOR AS YET I HAD LEARNED BUT LITTLE OF THE MARTIAN TONGUE
IT IS ONLY THE MEN OF HER KIND WHO WAR UPON US AND I HAVE EVER THOUGHT THAT THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD US IS BUT THE REFLECTION OF OURS TOWARD THEM THEY LIVE AT PEACE WITH ALL THEIR FELLOWS EXCEPT WHEN DUTY CALLS UPON THEM TO MAKE WAR WHILE WE ARE AT PEACE WITH NONE
FROM THEN ON SOLA INSTRUCTED ME IN THE MYSTERIES OF THE VARIOUS WEAPONS AND WITH THE MARTIAN YOUNG I SPENT SEVERAL HOURS EACH DAY PRACTICING UPON THE PLAZA
HIS EYES BULGING AND HIS JAW DROPPED AND THEN ANOTHER SAVAGE FACE APPEARED AND A THIRD AND FOURTH AND FIFTH CRANING THEIR NECKS OVER THE SHOULDERS OF THEIR FELLOWS WHOM THEY COULD NOT PASS UPON THE NARROW LEDGE
THEY HAVE NO LAWYERS I DID NOT SEE THE PRISONER AGAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS SUBSEQUENT TO OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER AND THEN ONLY TO CATCH A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF HER AS SHE WAS BEING CONDUCTED TO THE GREAT AUDIENCE CHAMBER WHERE I HAD HAD MY FIRST MEETING WITH LORQUAS PTOMEL
AND FROM MY BALCONY I COULD SEE THAT IT WALKED ERECT UPON TWO LEGS AND SURMISED THAT IT WAS SOME NEW AND STRANGE MARTIAN MONSTROSITY WITH WHICH I HAD NOT AS YET BECOME ACQUAINTED THEY REMOVED THEIR PRISONER TO THE GROUND
I DID NOT EVEN KNOW THAT THERE WERE ANY BETTER CONDITIONS TO ESCAPE TO BUT I WAS MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE MY CHANCES AMONG PEOPLE FASHIONED AFTER MY OWN MOLD RATHER THAN TO REMAIN LONGER AMONG THE HIDEOUS AND BLOODTHIRSTY GREEN MEN OF MARS
AND IN A FEW MOMENTS THEY HAD THROWN OUT GRAPPLING HOOKS AND THE BIG BOAT WAS BEING HAULED TO GROUND BY THEIR FELLOWS BELOW AFTER MAKING HER FAST THEY SWARMED THE SIDES AND SEARCHED THE VESSEL FROM STEM TO STERN
ENOUGH ONLY TO SUFFICE FOR MY DAILY NEEDS AS I REACHED THE DOORWAY OF OUR BUILDING A STRANGE SURPRISE AWAITED ME A WARRIOR APPROACHED BEARING THE ARMS ORNAMENTS AND FULL ACCOUTERMENTS OF HIS KIND THESE HE PRESENTED TO ME WITH A FEW UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS
AND THE GREAT WARSHIP LIGHTENED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE LOOT SOARED MAJESTICALLY INTO THE AIR HER DECKS AND UPPER WORKS A MASS OF ROARING FLAMES SLOWLY SHE DRIFTED TO THE SOUTHEAST RISING HIGHER AND HIGHER AS THE FLAMES ATE AWAY HER WOODEN PARTS
HER SKIN WAS OF A LIGHT REDDISH COPPER COLOR AGAINST WHICH THE CRIMSON GLOW OF HER CHEEKS AND THE RUBY OF HER BEAUTIFULLY MOLDED LIPS SHONE WITH A STRANGELY ENHANCING EFFECT SHE WAS AS DESTITUTE OF CLOTHES AS THE GREEN MARTIANS WHO ACCOMPANIED HER
AND A MIGHTY HOPE SURGED THROUGH ME THAT THE FLEET WOULD RETURN AND DEMAND A RECKONING FROM THE GREEN WARRIORS WHO HAD SO RUTHLESSLY AND WANTONLY ATTACKED IT CLOSE AT MY HEEL IN HIS NOW ACCUSTOMED PLACE FOLLOWED WOOLA THE HOUND
BUT WHERE TO GO AND HOW WAS AS MUCH OF A PUZZLE TO ME AS THE AGE OLD SEARCH FOR THE SPRING OF ETERNAL LIFE HAS BEEN TO EARTHLY MEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF TIME I DECIDED THAT AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY I WOULD TAKE SOLA INTO MY CONFIDENCE AND OPENLY ASK HER TO AID ME
I KNEW THAT SHE WAS FOND OF ME AND NOW THAT I HAD DISCOVERED THAT SHE HATED CRUELTY AND BARBARITY I WAS CONFIDENT THAT I COULD DEPEND UPON HER TO AID ME AND THE GIRL CAPTIVE TO ESCAPE PROVIDED OF COURSE THAT SUCH A THING WAS WITHIN THE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES
WITH ONE'S BACK TOWARD SOME HORRIBLE AND UNKNOWN DANGER FROM THE VERY SOUND OF WHICH THE FEROCIOUS APACHE WARRIORS TURN IN WILD STAMPEDE AS A FLOCK OF SHEEP WOULD MADLY FLEE FROM A PACK OF WOLVES SEEMS TO ME THE LAST WORD IN FEARSOME PREDICAMENTS
I FELT IT SAFER TO AFFECT INDIFFERENCE IN THE MATTER UNTIL I LEARNED MORE SURELY SOLA'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE OBJECT OF MY SOLICITUDE SARKOJA
I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE UNNECESSARY HARSHNESS AND BRUTALITY WITH WHICH HER GUARDS TREATED HER SO DIFFERENT FROM THE ALMOST MATERNAL KINDLINESS WHICH SOLA MANIFESTED TOWARD ME AND THE RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE OF THE FEW GREEN MARTIANS WHO TOOK THE TROUBLE TO NOTICE ME AT ALL
THE OTHER VESSELS FOLLOWED IN HER WAKE EACH ONE OPENING UPON US AS SHE SWUNG INTO POSITION OUR OWN FIRE NEVER DIMINISHED AND I DOUBT IF TWENTY FIVE PER CENT OF OUR SHOTS WENT WILD
INSTANTLY THE WARRIORS CEASED FIRING
AND THE SIGHT WHICH MET MY EYES WAS THAT OF A SLENDER GIRLISH FIGURE SIMILAR IN EVERY DETAIL TO THE EARTHLY WOMEN OF MY PAST LIFE SHE DID NOT SEE ME AT FIRST BUT JUST AS SHE WAS DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE PORTAL OF THE BUILDING WHICH WAS TO BE HER PRISON SHE TURNED
ON THE NIGHT FOLLOWING THE PRISONER'S VISIT TO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THE CONVERSATION FINALLY FELL UPON THIS SUBJECT AND I WAS ALL EARS ON THE INSTANT I HAD FEARED TO QUESTION SOLA RELATIVE TO THE BEAUTIFUL CAPTIVE
OR OF REINFORCEMENTS IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT SHE WOULD STRIKE THE FACE OF THE BUILDINGS ABOUT A MILE SOUTH OF OUR POSITION AND AS I WATCHED THE PROGRESS OF THE CHASE I SAW A NUMBER OF WARRIORS GALLOP AHEAD DISMOUNT AND ENTER THE BUILDING SHE SEEMED DESTINED TO TOUCH
THEY MAKE THE LAWS AS THEY ARE NEEDED A NEW LAW FOR EACH EMERGENCY THEY ARE UNFETTERED BY PRECEDENT IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE CUSTOMS HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN BY AGES OF REPETITION
BUT I CAN SAY WITHOUT SHAME THAT IF THE SENSATIONS I ENDURED DURING THE NEXT FEW MINUTES WERE FEAR THEN MAY GOD HELP THE COWARD FOR COWARDICE IS OF A SURETY ITS OWN PUNISHMENT TO BE HELD PARALYZED
AND WHEN THE NECESSITY ARISES FIGHT WITH EVEN GREATER INTELLIGENCE AND FEROCITY THAN THE MEN THE MEN ARE TRAINED IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF THE ART OF WAR IN STRATEGY AND THE MANEUVERING OF LARGE BODIES OF TROOPS
AND I WAS LEFT TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF MY POSITION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION I COULD BUT VAGUELY CONJECTURE THE CAUSE OF MY PARALYSIS AND MY ONLY HOPE LAY IN THAT IT MIGHT PASS OFF AS SUDDENLY AS IT HAD FALLEN UPON ME
AND DIMINISHED THE WEIGHT UPON HER ASCENDING TO THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING I WATCHED HER FOR HOURS UNTIL FINALLY SHE WAS LOST IN THE DIM VISTAS OF THE DISTANCE THE SIGHT WAS AWE INSPIRING IN THE EXTREME AS ONE CONTEMPLATED THIS MIGHTY FLOATING FUNERAL PYRE
SO DIFFERENT IS IT FROM THE ASPECT OF ANY OTHER SPOT UPON OUR EARTH AS I STOOD THUS MEDITATING I TURNED MY GAZE FROM THE LANDSCAPE TO THE HEAVENS WHERE THE MYRIAD STARS FORMED A GORGEOUS AND FITTING CANOPY FOR THE WONDERS OF THE EARTHLY SCENE
HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE AUDIENCE AS ONE OF THE CAPTIVE'S GUARDS AND IT WAS TOWARD HER THE QUESTION TURNED WHEN ASKED ONE OF THE WOMEN WILL WE ENJOY THE DEATH THROES OF THE RED ONE OR DOES LORQUAS PTOMEL JED INTEND HOLDING HER FOR RANSOM
WITH THIS ADDED INCENTIVE I NEARLY DROVE SOLA DISTRACTED BY MY IMPORTUNITIES TO HASTEN ON MY EDUCATION AND WITHIN A FEW MORE DAYS I HAD MASTERED THE MARTIAN TONGUE SUFFICIENTLY WELL TO ENABLE ME TO CARRY ON A PASSABLE CONVERSATION
MY ATTENTION WAS QUICKLY RIVETED BY A LARGE RED STAR CLOSE TO THE DISTANT HORIZON AS I GAZED UPON IT I FELT A SPELL OF OVERPOWERING FASCINATION IT WAS MARS THE GOD OF WAR
THIS HAD RECEIVED THE BRUNT OF OUR FIRE AND SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY UNMANNED AS NOT A MOVING FIGURE WAS VISIBLE UPON HER DECKS SLOWLY SHE SWUNG FROM HER COURSE
AND FAR FROM BEING IN A POSITION TO INFLICT HARM UPON US SHE COULD NOT EVEN CONTROL HERSELF SUFFICIENTLY TO ESCAPE AS SHE NEARED THE CITY THE WARRIORS RUSHED OUT UPON THE PLAIN TO MEET HER
INDEED SAVE FOR HER HIGHLY WROUGHT ORNAMENTS SHE WAS ENTIRELY NAKED NOR COULD ANY APPAREL HAVE ENHANCED THE BEAUTY OF HER PERFECT AND SYMMETRICAL FIGURE AS HER GAZE RESTED ON ME HER EYES OPENED WIDE IN ASTONISHMENT AND SHE MADE A LITTLE SIGN WITH HER FREE HAND
FACING MY UNKNOWN FOE AND THEN THE MOONLIGHT FLOODED THE CAVE
FOR EXAMPLE A PROPORTION OF THEM ALWAYS THE BEST MARKSMEN DIRECT THEIR FIRE ENTIRELY UPON THE WIRELESS FINDING AND SIGHTING APPARATUS OF THE BIG GUNS OF AN ATTACKING NAVAL FORCE ANOTHER DETAIL ATTENDS TO THE SMALLER GUNS IN THE SAME WAY
I REASONED WITH MYSELF THAT I HAD LAIN HELPLESS FOR MANY HOURS WITHIN THE CAVE
AND AS I EMERGED UPON THE STREET SOLA RUSHED UP TO ME AS THOUGH I HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF SOME SEARCH ON HER PART THE CAVALCADE WAS RETURNING TO THE PLAZA THE HOMEWARD MARCH HAVING BEEN GIVEN UP FOR THAT DAY NOR IN FACT WAS IT RECOMMENCED FOR MORE THAN A WEEK
BUT IT HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT AS IT WAS TO START ME SPECULATING ON THE POSSIBLE HORROR WHICH LURKED IN THE SHADOWS AT MY BACK FEAR IS A RELATIVE TERM AND SO I CAN ONLY MEASURE MY FEELINGS AT THAT TIME BY WHAT I HAD EXPERIENCED IN PREVIOUS POSITIONS OF DANGER AND BY THOSE THAT I HAVE PASSED THROUGH SINCE
CHAPTER EIGHT A FAIR CAPTIVE FROM THE SKY THE THIRD DAY AFTER THE INCUBATOR CEREMONY WE SET FORTH TOWARD HOME BUT SCARCELY HAD THE HEAD OF THE PROCESSION DEBOUCHED INTO THE OPEN GROUND BEFORE THE CITY
AS I COULD NOT BUT RECALL THE STRANGE EXPRESSION I HAD NOTED UPON HER FACE AFTER MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE PRISONER THAT IT DENOTED JEALOUSY I COULD NOT SAY AND YET JUDGING ALL THINGS BY MUNDANE STANDARDS AS I STILL DID
WITH THE EYES STARING TOWARD THE OPEN LEDGE AND THE HANDS RESTING LIMPLY UPON THE GROUND I LOOKED FIRST AT MY LIFELESS CLAY THERE UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CAVE AND THEN DOWN AT MYSELF IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT FOR THERE I LAY CLOTHED
THE NOISE OF THE APPROACHING HORSES HAD CEASED AND I JUDGED THE INDIANS WERE CREEPING STEALTHILY UPON ME ALONG THE LITTLE LEDGE WHICH LED TO MY LIVING TOMB I REMEMBER THAT I HOPED THEY WOULD MAKE SHORT WORK OF ME
AND AS MY HORSE HAD WANDERED OFF I WAS LEFT WITHOUT MEANS OF DEFENSE MY ONLY ALTERNATIVE SEEMED TO LIE IN FLIGHT
THE FOREMOST VESSEL SWUNG BROADSIDE TOWARD US AND BRINGING HER GUNS INTO PLAY RETURNED OUR FIRE AT THE SAME TIME MOVING PARALLEL TO OUR FRONT FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND THEN TURNING BACK WITH THE EVIDENT INTENTION OF COMPLETING A GREAT CIRCLE WHICH WOULD BRING HER UP TO POSITION ONCE MORE OPPOSITE OUR FIRING LINE
AND A QUANTITY OF SOLID FOODS AND LIQUIDS INCLUDING MANY CASKS OF WATER THE FIRST I HAD SEEN SINCE MY ADVENT UPON MARS
A SIGN WHICH I DID NOT OF COURSE UNDERSTAND JUST A MOMENT WE GAZED UPON EACH OTHER AND THEN THE LOOK OF HOPE AND RENEWED COURAGE WHICH HAD GLORIFIED HER FACE AS SHE DISCOVERED ME FADED INTO ONE OF UTTER DEJECTION MINGLED WITH LOATHING AND CONTEMPT
THE LAST WARRIOR TO LEAVE THE DECK TURNED AND THREW SOMETHING BACK UPON THE VESSEL WAITING AN INSTANT TO NOTE THE OUTCOME OF HIS ACT AS A FAINT SPURT OF FLAME ROSE FROM THE POINT WHERE THE MISSILE STRUCK HE SWUNG OVER THE SIDE AND WAS QUICKLY UPON THE GROUND
RATHER THAN THE ROUTING BY OUR GREEN WARRIORS OF A HORDE OF SIMILAR THOUGH UNFRIENDLY CREATURES I COULD NOT FATHOM THE SEEMING HALLUCINATION NOR COULD I FREE MYSELF FROM IT BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE INNERMOST RECESSES OF MY SOUL I FELT A STRANGE YEARNING TOWARD THESE UNKNOWN FOEMEN
I DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE BUT FIRST I LIFTED MY HEAD TO FILL MY LUNGS WITH THE PURE INVIGORATING NIGHT AIR OF THE MOUNTAINS AS I DID SO I SAW STRETCHING FAR BELOW ME THE BEAUTIFUL VISTA OF ROCKY GORGE AND LEVEL CACTI STUDDED FLAT
MUCH DEPRESSED AND TO ME UNACCOUNTABLY SO I SLOWLY DESCENDED TO THE STREET THE SCENE I HAD WITNESSED SEEMED TO MARK THE DEFEAT AND ANNIHILATION OF THE FORCES OF A KINDRED PEOPLE
FOR A MAN WHO HAD EVER BEEN USED TO FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE WITH ALL THE ENERGY OF A POWERFUL PHYSIQUE SEVERAL TIMES I THOUGHT I HEARD FAINT SOUNDS BEHIND ME AS OF SOMEBODY MOVING CAUTIOUSLY BUT EVENTUALLY EVEN THESE CEASED
HE CAN METE OUT NO WORSE FATE TO ME THAN A CONTINUATION OF THE HORRIBLE EXISTENCE WE ARE FORCED TO LEAD IN THIS LIFE THIS WILD OUTBREAK ON THE PART OF SOLA SO GREATLY SURPRISED AND SHOCKED THE OTHER WOMEN THAT AFTER A FEW WORDS OF GENERAL REPRIMAND
THE GREEN MARTIAN WARRIORS FIRED A TERRIFIC VOLLEY FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE BUILDINGS FACING THE LITTLE VALLEY ACROSS WHICH THE GREAT SHIPS WERE SO PEACEFULLY ADVANCING INSTANTLY THE SCENE CHANGED AS BY MAGIC
FOREVER WARRING AMONG OUR OWN KIND AS WELL AS UPON THE RED MEN AND EVEN IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES THE INDIVIDUALS FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES OH IT IS ONE CONTINUAL AWFUL PERIOD OF BLOODSHED FROM THE TIME WE BREAK THE SHELL UNTIL WE GLADLY EMBRACE THE BOSOM OF THE RIVER OF MYSTERY
THE CRISP FRESH MOUNTAIN AIR OUTSIDE THE CAVE ACTED AS AN IMMEDIATE TONIC AND I FELT NEW LIFE AND NEW COURAGE COURSING THROUGH ME PAUSING UPON THE BRINK OF THE LEDGE I UPBRAIDED MYSELF FOR WHAT NOW SEEMED TO ME WHOLLY UNWARRANTED APPREHENSION
I MOUNTED TO AN UPPER FLOOR AND PEERED FROM THE WINDOW OUT OVER THE VALLEY AND THE HILLS BEYOND AND THERE I SAW THE CAUSE OF THEIR SUDDEN SCURRYING TO COVER A HUGE CRAFT LONG LOW AND GRAY PAINTED SWUNG SLOWLY OVER THE CREST OF THE NEAREST HILL
SARKOJA AND THE OTHER WOMEN GRUNTED ANGRILY AT THIS EVIDENCE OF WEAKNESS ON THE PART OF SOLA IT IS SAD SOLA THAT YOU WERE NOT BORN A MILLION YEARS AGO SNAPPED SARKOJA WHEN ALL THE HOLLOWS OF THE LAND WERE FILLED WITH WATER
I WAS NOT YET PROFICIENT WITH ALL THE WEAPONS BUT MY GREAT FAMILIARITY WITH SIMILAR EARTHLY WEAPONS MADE ME AN UNUSUALLY APT PUPIL AND I PROGRESSED IN A VERY SATISFACTORY MANNER THE TRAINING OF MYSELF AND THE YOUNG MARTIANS WAS CONDUCTED SOLELY BY THE WOMEN
I COULD SEE FIGURES CROWDING THE FORWARD DECKS AND UPPER WORKS OF THE AIR CRAFT WHETHER THEY HAD DISCOVERED US OR SIMPLY WERE LOOKING AT THE DESERTED CITY I COULD NOT SAY BUT IN ANY EVENT THEY RECEIVED A RUDE RECEPTION FOR SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING
THAN ORDERS WERE GIVEN FOR AN IMMEDIATE AND HASTY RETURN AS THOUGH TRAINED FOR YEARS IN THIS PARTICULAR EVOLUTION THE GREEN MARTIANS MELTED LIKE MIST INTO THE SPACIOUS DOORWAYS OF THE NEARBY BUILDINGS UNTIL IN LESS THAN THREE MINUTES
AS I GAZED AT IT ON THAT FAR GONE NIGHT IT SEEMED TO CALL ACROSS THE UNTHINKABLE VOID TO LURE ME TO IT TO DRAW ME AS THE LODESTONE ATTRACTS A PARTICLE OF IRON MY LONGING WAS BEYOND THE POWER OF OPPOSITION
AND SEEMED BUT BARELY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THEIR DEPLETED CREWS THEIR FIRE HAD CEASED ENTIRELY AND ALL THEIR ENERGIES SEEMED FOCUSED UPON ESCAPE OUR WARRIORS THEN RUSHED UP TO THE ROOFS OF THE BUILDINGS WHICH WE OCCUPIED
DRIFTING UNGUIDED AND UNMANNED THROUGH THE LONELY WASTES OF THE MARTIAN HEAVENS A DERELICT OF DEATH AND DESTRUCTION TYPIFYING THE LIFE STORY OF THESE STRANGE AND FEROCIOUS CREATURES INTO WHOSE UNFRIENDLY HANDS FATE HAD CARRIED IT
AND THERE CAME AGAIN FROM THE BLACK SHADOWS THE SOUND OF A MOVING THING AND A FAINT RUSTLING AS OF DEAD LEAVES THE SHOCK TO MY ALREADY OVERSTRAINED NERVOUS SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE IN THE EXTREME AND WITH A SUPERHUMAN EFFORT I STROVE TO BREAK MY AWFUL BONDS
AS I DID NOT PARTICULARLY RELISH THE THOUGHT OF THE INNUMERABLE THINGS THEY MIGHT DO TO ME IF THE SPIRIT PROMPTED THEM I HAD NOT LONG TO WAIT BEFORE A STEALTHY SOUND APPRISED ME OF THEIR NEARNESS AND THEN A WAR BONNETED PAINT STREAKED FACE WAS THRUST CAUTIOUSLY AROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE CLIFF
I HAD OBSERVED ON THE TWO OCCASIONS WHEN I HAD SEEN HER THAT THE PRISONER EXCHANGED WORDS WITH HER GUARDS AND THIS CONVINCED ME THAT THEY SPOKE
A SENSE OF DELICIOUS DREAMINESS OVERCAME ME MY MUSCLES RELAXED AND I WAS ON THE POINT OF GIVING WAY TO MY DESIRE TO SLEEP WHEN THE SOUND OF APPROACHING HORSES REACHED MY EARS
AS I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD CARE TO ENTRUST SUCH AS YOU WITH THE GRAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF MATERNITY I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH MY EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IN THIS RED WOMAN RETORTED SOLA SHE HAS NEVER HARMED US NOR WOULD SHE SHOULD WE HAVE FALLEN INTO HER HANDS
OWING TO THE FEAR OF A RETURN ATTACK BY THE AIR CRAFT LORQUAS PTOMEL WAS TOO ASTUTE AN OLD WARRIOR TO BE CAUGHT UPON THE OPEN PLAINS WITH A CARAVAN OF CHARIOTS AND CHILDREN AND SO WE REMAINED AT THE DESERTED CITY UNTIL THE DANGER SEEMED PASSED
AND HER EYES MET MINE HER FACE WAS OVAL AND BEAUTIFUL IN THE EXTREME HER EVERY FEATURE WAS FINELY CHISELED AND EXQUISITE HER EYES LARGE AND LUSTROUS AND HER HEAD SURMOUNTED BY A MASS OF COAL BLACK WAVING HAIR
IS THIS THEN DEATH HAVE I INDEED PASSED OVER FOREVER INTO THAT OTHER LIFE BUT I COULD NOT WELL BELIEVE THIS AS I COULD FEEL MY HEART POUNDING AGAINST MY RIBS FROM THE EXERTION OF MY EFFORTS TO RELEASE MYSELF FROM THE ANAESTHESIS WHICH HAD HELD ME
AND YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT TOO FOR THEY HAVE EATEN MANY OTHER PEOPLE
THE YELLOW DWARF DEEPLY ENRAGED AT THESE WORDS SET SPURS TO HIS CAT WHICH YELLED HORRIBLY AND LEAPED HITHER AND THITHER TERRIFYING EVERYBODY EXCEPT THE BRAVE KING WHO PURSUED THE DWARF CLOSELY TILL HE
MESSENGERS WERE SENT TO ALL THE GAYEST AND MOST REFINED COURTS
AND THEN UP THE TREE AND THERE SHE SAW A LITTLE TINY MAN WHO WAS EATING ORANGES OH QUEEN SAID HE I KNOW YOU VERY WELL AND I KNOW HOW MUCH AFRAID YOU ARE OF THE LIONS
BUT THEY HAD HARDLY TAKEN THEIR PLACES FACING ONE ANOTHER AND THE WHOLE COURT HAD ONLY JUST HAD TIME TO RUSH OUT UPON THE BALCONIES TO WATCH WHAT WAS GOING ON
YOU CRIED BELLISSIMA STARTING BACK MY MOTHER
HOPING SHE MAY TREAD ON THEM
THE QUEEN WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT SHE HAD HARDLY BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP AT ALL AND SHE GOT UP BEFORE IT WAS LIGHT TO GIVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS AND TO CHOOSE THE JEWELS THAT THE PRINCESS WAS TO WEAR THESE WERE NOTHING LESS THAN DIAMONDS
AND MAKE A GREATER TRIUMPH HIS THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT WAS DELIGHTED TO HEAR THEM SING OF HER TRIUMPHS SHE LED THE KING INTO THE MOST SPLENDID ROOM THAT CAN BE IMAGINED AND LEFT HIM ALONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE
DO LEAVE ME IN PEACE MADAM I DON'T WANT TO CARE FOR ANYONE BUT YOU WOULD BE VERY HAPPY WITH ANY OF THESE PRINCES SAID THE QUEEN
AND THAT NEITHER OF THESE WAS THE REAL REASON OF THE QUEEN'S UNEASINESS SO SHE MADE UP HER MIND THAT SHE WOULD GO AND CONSULT THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT ABOUT IT ESPECIALLY AS SHE HAD OFTEN HEARD HOW WISE SHE WAS
AND AS HE SPOKE THE QUEEN SAW THE LIONS WHICH WERE RUNNING DOWN A HILL TOWARD THEM EACH ONE HAD TWO HEADS EIGHT FEET AND FOUR ROWS OF TEETH
BUT THAT HER DAUGHTER SEEMED SO UNWILLING TO MARRY AND SHE RECOMMENDED THEM TO GO AND TALK TO THE PRINCESS ABOUT IT THEMSELVES SO THIS THEY AT ONCE DID NOW BELLISSIMA WAS MUCH LESS PROUD SINCE HER ADVENTURE WITH THE YELLOW DWARF
AND THE QUEEN MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE A HUNDRED TIMES SHE ASKED BELLISSIMA IF ANYTHING WAS THE MATTER WITH HER
AND BRANDISHING HER CRUTCH THREATENINGLY SHE CRIED
AT LAST THE CHIEF MEN OF THE KINGDOM ANXIOUS TO SEE THEIR PRINCESS MARRIED SENT TO THE QUEEN TO BEG HER TO CHOOSE A HUSBAND FOR HER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SHE REPLIED THAT NOTHING WOULD PLEASE HER BETTER
AS FOR THE PRINCESS THE MORE SHE SAW OF THE KING THE MORE SHE LIKED HIM HE WAS SO GENEROUS SO HANDSOME AND CLEVER THAT AT LAST SHE WAS ALMOST AS MUCH IN LOVE WITH HIM AS HE WAS WITH HER
SHE WAS DRESSED ALMOST ALWAYS IN THE PRETTIEST FROCKS AS A FAIRY OR AS A QUEEN GOING OUT TO HUNT AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FOLLOWED HER DRESSED AS FOREST FAIRIES AND TO MAKE HER MORE VAIN THAN EVER
NEVER HAS THERE BEEN A GAYER COURT TWENTY DELIGHTFUL KINGS DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD THINK OF TO MAKE THEMSELVES AGREEABLE AND AFTER HAVING SPENT EVER SO MUCH MONEY IN GIVING A SINGLE ENTERTAINMENT
BUT THE YELLOW DWARF WAS TOO QUICK FOR HIM LEAPING WITH HIS SPANISH CAT UPON THE BALCONY HE SNATCHED BELLISSIMA FROM THE QUEEN'S ARMS AND BEFORE ANY OF THE LADIES OF THE COURT COULD STOP HIM HE HAD SPRUNG UPON THE ROOF OF THE PALACE AND DISAPPEARED WITH HIS PRIZE
LOOK AT ME WELL PRINCESS BEFORE YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD SAID HE I DON'T WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME IN A HURRY OH CRIED SHE THE LIONS ARE COMING I HAVE LOOKED AT YOU ENOUGH I AM SO FRIGHTENED
DID NOT SPARE PRETTY SPEECHES AND AFTER A TIME HE WAS ALLOWED TO WALK BY HIMSELF UPON THE SEA SHORE THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT HAD BY HER ENCHANTMENTS RAISED SUCH A TERRIBLE STORM THAT THE BOLDEST PILOT WOULD NOT VENTURE OUT IN IT
FIVE OR SIX TIMES A DAY JUST TO PLEASE HER
WHAT SHE CRIED WAS I NOT UNHAPPY ENOUGH IN THIS LONELY CASTLE TO WHICH THAT FRIGHTFUL YELLOW DWARF BROUGHT ME MUST I ALSO BE MADE TO KNOW THAT THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES CEASED TO LOVE ME
WITH THESE THISTLES AND NETTLES SHE CAN FEED A DONKEY WHICH SHE CAN RIDE WHENEVER SHE LIKES UNDER THIS HUMBLE ROOF NO WEATHER CAN HURT HER SHE WILL DRINK THE WATER OF THIS BROOK AND EAT FROGS WHICH GROW VERY FAT ABOUT HERE
PRETENDING THAT SHE WAS GOING TO BED BUT INSTEAD OF THAT SHE WRAPPED HERSELF IN A LONG WHITE VEIL AND WENT DOWN A SECRET STAIRCASE AND SET OFF ALL BY HERSELF TO FIND THE WITCH BUT WHEN SHE GOT AS FAR AS THE SAME FATAL ORANGE TREE
SO YOU MUST NOT GRUDGE THEM MY COMPASSION THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES WAS QUITE OVERCOME BY THE PRINCESS'S GOOD NATURED WAY OF TAKING HIS INTERFERENCE AND THROWING HIMSELF AT HER FEET HE KISSED HER HAND A THOUSAND TIMES
AT THAT MOMENT SHE HEARD THE ROARING OF THE GREAT LIONS WHO HAD FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS NEAR AND WERE COMING TO LOOK FOR HER
SEEING THAT I HAVE LOST THE BASKET OF CAKE
PREPARATIONS WERE BEGUN AT ONCE FOR THE GRANDEST WEDDING THAT HAD EVER BEEN HELD AT THE PALACE THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES SENT SUCH IMMENSE SUMS OF MONEY
AND THEN SHE WILL HAVE ME ALWAYS WITH HER HANDSOME AGREEABLE AND GAY AS YOU SEE ME NOW FOR IF HER SHADOW STAYS BY HER MORE CLOSELY THAN I DO I SHALL BE SURPRISED
EVERYTHING BECAME DARK AND HE FELT HIMSELF CARRIED ALONG THROUGH THE AIR BY A STRONG HAND THIS NEW MISFORTUNE WAS THE WORK OF THE WICKED FAIRY OF THE DESERT WHO HAD COME WITH THE YELLOW DWARF TO HELP HIM CARRY OFF THE PRINCESS
EVEN TO HER SHOES WHICH WERE COVERED WITH THEM AND HER DRESS OF SILVER BROCADE WAS EMBROIDERED WITH A DOZEN OF THE SUN'S RAYS YOU MAY IMAGINE HOW MUCH THESE HAD COST
BELLISSIMA SHALL MARRY YOU
AND WERE BRIGHT RED AT THIS DREADFUL SIGHT THE POOR QUEEN WHO WAS TREMBLING LIKE A DOVE WHEN IT SEES A HAWK CRIED OUT AS LOUD AS SHE COULD
THE QUEEN AND THE PRINCESS WERE JUST READY TO SET OUT WITH THE KING WHEN THEY SAW ADVANCING TOWARD THEM FROM THE END OF THE LONG GALLERY TWO GREAT BASILISKS DRAGGING AFTER THEM A VERY BADLY MADE BOX
SAVE ME THIS MINUTE OR I SHALL DIE OF TERROR INDEED AS SHE SPOKE SHE FELL DOWN INSENSIBLE
I FLATTER MYSELF THAT YOU WILL NOT BE DISPLEASED AT HER CHOICE WHEN I TELL YOU
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH HER PRETTY ONE SAID THE LITTLE MONSTER FOR I AM A FRIEND OF HERS AND FOR THE MATTER OF THAT I AM QUITE AS CLEVER AS SHE IS THE QUEEN MY MOTHER REPLIED THE PRINCESS
ALL THE KING'S UNSUCCESSFUL RIVALS HAD GONE HOME IN DESPAIR THEY SAID GOOD BY TO THE PRINCESS SO SADLY THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING SORRY FOR THEM AH MADAM THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES SAID TO HER
AND SEEING UPON A TABLE A GRANDER COAT THAN HIS OWN HE PUT IT ON CAREFULLY THE FAIRY CAME BACK SO DELIGHTED THAT SHE COULD NOT CONCEAL HER JOY I AM QUITE AWARE OF THE TROUBLE YOU HAVE TAKEN TO PLEASE ME SAID SHE
SHE SOON FELT VERY TIRED AND SAT DOWN AT THE FOOT OF A TREE TO REST AND PRESENTLY FELL FAST ASLEEP WHEN SHE AWOKE SHE WAS DISMAYED TO FIND HER BASKET EMPTY THE CAKE WAS ALL GONE AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE
WAS FEELING TERRIBLY SAD AT BEING SO RAPIDLY TORN AWAY FROM HIS BELOVED PRINCESS BUT HE KNEW TOO WELL HOW POWERFUL THE FAIRY WAS TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING FROM HER EXCEPT BY GREAT PATIENCE AND CUNNING
THIS IS ONE THAT SHE LIKED VERY MUCH
MAY I BURN MY CRUTCH AH PRINCESS SAID THE QUEEN WEEPING WHAT IS THIS THAT I HEAR WHAT HAVE YOU PROMISED AH MY MOTHER REPLIED BELLISSIMA SADLY
OR NOT SO WITH GREAT CARE SHE MADE SOME OF THE PROPER CAKE TO PACIFY THE LIONS
AND NEVER TRIED TO CORRECT ANY OF HER FAULTS THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THIS LITTLE PERSON WHO WAS AS PRETTY AS POSSIBLE AND WAS ONE DAY TO WEAR A CROWN
SHE FOUND TO HER GREAT SURPRISE THAT SHE WAS LYING IN HER OWN BED AT HOME AND WHAT WAS MORE THAT SHE HAD ON THE LOVELIEST LACE NIGHT CAP THAT SHE HAD EVER SEEN IN HER LIFE AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT THAT ALL HER ADVENTURES
UTTERED SUCH PIERCING CRIES AND LAMENTATIONS THAT THE KING HEARING THEM ENTIRELY LOST HIS COURAGE AND PRESENCE OF MIND GIVING UP THE COMBAT HE FLEW TOWARD THE PRINCESS
THAT SHE COULD NEITHER EAT DRINK NOR SLEEP FOR THINKING OF IT THE PRINCESS WHO IN SPITE OF HER WILFULNESS REALLY LOVED HER MOTHER WITH ALL HER HEART WAS MUCH GRIEVED WHEN SHE SAW HER LOOKING SO SAD AND OFTEN ASKED HER WHAT WAS THE MATTER
WHO CAME TO MEET THEM JOYFULLY SINGING THESE WORDS WHEN LOVE WITHIN A HEART WOULD REIGN USELESS TO STRIVE AGAINST HIM TIS THE PROUD BUT FEEL A SHARPER PAIN
RASH YOUTH HE CRIED RUSHING BETWEEN THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT AND THE KING DARE TO LAY A FINGER UPON THIS ILLUSTRIOUS FAIRY YOUR QUARREL IS WITH ME ONLY I AM YOUR ENEMY AND YOUR RIVAL
HER MOTHER WHO SINCE THE DEATH OF THE KING HER FATHER HAD NOTHING IN THE WORLD SHE CARED FOR SO MUCH AS THIS LITTLE PRINCESS WAS SO TERRIBLY AFRAID OF LOSING HER THAT SHE QUITE SPOILED HER
AND SAW IT COVERED WITH FLOWERS AND FRUIT SHE STOPPED AND BEGAN TO GATHER SOME OF THE ORANGES AND THEN PUTTING DOWN HER BASKET SHE SAT DOWN TO EAT THEM BUT WHEN IT WAS TIME TO GO ON AGAIN THE BASKET HAD DISAPPEARED AND THOUGH SHE LOOKED EVERYWHERE
THE UNHAPPY QUEEN SEEING ALL AT ONCE WHAT A MISERABLE LIFE HER DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE WITH THIS DWARF COULD NOT BEAR THE IDEA AND FELL DOWN INSENSIBLE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD WHEN SHE REVIVED
AND I SHALL BE VERY ANGRY IF YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ANYONE WHO IS NOT WORTHY OF YOU BUT THE PRINCESS THOUGHT SO MUCH OF HERSELF THAT SHE DID NOT CONSIDER ANY ONE OF HER LOVERS CLEVER OR HANDSOME ENOUGH FOR HER
THE TERRIBLE LIONS AND HER PROMISE TO THE YELLOW DWARF THAT HE SHOULD MARRY BELLISSIMA MUST HAVE BEEN A DREAM BUT THERE WAS THE NEW CAP WITH ITS BEAUTIFUL RIBBON AND LACE TO REMIND HER THAT IT WAS ALL TRUE WHICH MADE HER SO UNHAPPY
THAT I FEAR THAT SHE WILL DIE AND I AM AFRAID THAT PERHAPS I AM THE CAUSE OF IT FOR SHE VERY MUCH WISHES ME TO BE MARRIED
BUT THE QUEEN WHO DIDN'T WANT HER TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH ONLY SAID THAT SHE WAS ILL OR THAT ONE OF HER NEIGHBORS WAS THREATENING TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HER BELLISSIMA KNEW QUITE WELL THAT SOMETHING WAS BEING HIDDEN FROM HER
WITHOUT THE YELLOW DWARF AND HIS ORANGE TREE
EVERY ONE OF THEM BUT UPON EACH IT HAD A DIFFERENT EFFECT ONE FELL ILL ONE WENT QUITE CRAZY
AND HER MOTHER WHO WAS GETTING REALLY ANGRY AT HER DETERMINATION NOT TO BE MARRIED BEGAN TO WISH THAT SHE HAD NOT ALLOWED HER TO HAVE HER OWN WAY SO MUCH AT LAST NOT KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO DO
BUT JUST AS THEY PASSED SHE LOOKED UP AND SAW THE KING AND THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT NOW THE FAIRY WAS SO CLEVER THAT SHE COULD NOT ONLY SEEM BEAUTIFUL TO THE KING BUT EVEN THE POOR PRINCESS THOUGHT HER THE MOST LOVELY BEING SHE HAD EVER SEEN
AND YOU WILL SOON FIND OUT THAT I AM MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU ARE WRETCHED LITTLE MONSTER SAID THE KING DO YOU DARE TO CALL YOURSELF THE PRINCESS'S LOVER AND TO LAY CLAIM TO SUCH A TREASURE
NOT A TRACE OF IT COULD SHE FIND THE MORE SHE HUNTED FOR IT THE MORE FRIGHTENED SHE GOT AND AT LAST SHE BEGAN TO CRY THEN ALL AT ONCE SHE SAW BEFORE HER THE YELLOW DWARF WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU MY PRETTY ONE SAID HE
AND TAKE AWAY FROM HIM A PROUD PRINCESS
LIGHTEN MY SORROW WITH SOFT TEARS ALAS ALAS I SEE NO MORE MY LOVE WHO YET MY SADNESS CHEERS AND THOU O RAGING STORMY SEA
WHO WAS SO CALLED BECAUSE HE WAS A DWARF AND HAD SUCH A YELLOW FACE AND LIVED IN THE ORANGE TREE I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT FOR I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A WIFE ALL OVER THE WORLD NOW IF YOU WILL PROMISE THAT SHE SHALL MARRY ME
AS SOON AS THE SWANS WHICH DREW THE FAIRY'S CHARIOT HAD ALIGHTED UNDER A PORCH WHICH WAS PAVED WITH DIAMONDS AND HAD ARCHES OF RUBIES THEY WERE GREETED ON ALL SIDES BY THOUSANDS OF BEAUTIFUL BEINGS
LIKE GIANTS MOUNTAINS HIGH AND FIRE FLEW FROM THEIR MOUTHS AND EARS UNTIL THEY LOOKED LIKE FLAMING FURNACES NONE OF THESE THINGS COULD TERRIFY THE NOBLE YOUNG KING AND THE BOLDNESS OF HIS LOOKS AND ACTIONS REASSURED THOSE WHO WERE LOOKING ON
WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED BY HIS CRUEL CAPTOR PRESENTLY AFTER WALKING WILDLY UP AND DOWN HE WROTE THESE VERSES UPON THE SAND WITH HIS STICK AT LAST MAY I UPON THIS SHORE
SO MAKING HIM MOUNT HER CHARIOT TO WHICH SHE HAD HARNESSED SWANS INSTEAD OF THE BATS WHICH GENERALLY DREW IT AWAY SHE FLEW WITH HIM BUT IMAGINE THE DISTRESS OF THE PRINCE WHEN FROM THE GIDDY HEIGHT AT WHICH THEY WERE RUSHING THROUGH THE AIR
WHICH WERE GIVEN AWAY TO EVERYONE WHO LIKED TO HOLD OUT HIS HAND WHICH NUMBERS OF PEOPLE HASTENED TO DO YOU MAY BE SURE INDEED SOME FOUND THIS BY FAR THE MOST AMUSING PART OF THE WEDDING FESTIVITIES
SUGAR CANDY AND CROCODILE'S EGGS THIS CAKE SHE PREPARED WITH HER OWN HANDS AND PUTTING IT IN A LITTLE BASKET SHE SET OUT TO SEEK THE FAIRY BUT AS SHE WAS NOT USED TO WALKING FAR
BELLISSIMA COULD NOT HAVE MARRIED TWENTY KINGS INDEED SHE HAD FOUND IT QUITE DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO CHOOSE ONE FOR HER VANITY MADE HER BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE WORLD WHO WAS WORTHY OF HER
AND SHE COULD NOT THINK OF A BETTER WAY OF GETTING RID OF THE LITTLE MONSTER THAN TO MARRY SOME POWERFUL KING THEREFORE SHE REPLIED TO THEIR REQUEST MUCH MORE FAVORABLY THAN THEY HAD HOPED SAYING THAT THOUGH SHE WAS VERY HAPPY AS SHE WAS
BUT HAD NOT THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD EVER CARE ABOUT HIM AT ALL YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE HOW DELIGHTED HE WAS WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS AND HOW ANGRY IT MADE ALL THE OTHER KINGS TO LOSE FOR EVER THE HOPE OF MARRYING THE PRINCESS BUT AFTER ALL
AND KNEW IN A MOMENT THAT THIS MUST BE THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT FOR HER FEET WERE THE ONE THING SHE COULD NOT CHANGE HOWEVER PRETTY SHE MIGHT MAKE HER FACE WITHOUT SEEMING TO HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING HE SAID IN A CONFIDENTIAL WAY
NOT ONE OF THE LIONS TIGERS OR BEARS SHALL TOUCH YOU THE QUEEN LOOKED AT HIM AND WAS ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF HIS UGLY LITTLE FACE AS SHE HAD BEEN OF THE LIONS BEFORE SO THAT SHE COULD NOT SPEAK A WORD
EXCEPT THE BEAUTY OF THE PRINCESS UPON HER HEAD SHE WORE A SPLENDID CROWN HER LOVELY HAIR WAVED NEARLY TO HER FEET AND HER STATELY FIGURE COULD EASILY BE DISTINGUISHED AMONG ALL THE LADIES WHO ATTENDED HER
AND EVERY ONE OF THE PRINCES WISHED TO MARRY HER
SHE THOUGHT THAT IF SHE CARRIED HIM OFF TO SOME FRIGHTFUL CAVERN AND CHAINED HIM TO A ROCK THEN THE FEAR OF DEATH WOULD MAKE HIM FORGET BELLISSIMA AND BECOME HER SLAVE SO AS SOON AS THEY REACHED THE PLACE
THE QUEEN YOUR MOTHER HAS PROMISED YOU IN MARRIAGE HAS PROMISED ME INTERRUPTED THE PRINCESS OH NO I'M SURE SHE HAS NOT
WHEN THE PRINCESS SAW ALL THESE THINGS AND REMEMBERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED SHE TOO FELL INTO THE DEEPEST SADNESS
IS IT YOU DEAR PRINCE WHAT MISFORTUNE HAS BROUGHT YOU TO THIS DISMAL PLACE THE KING WHO WAS QUITE DECEIVED BY HER ALTERED APPEARANCE REPLIED ALAS BEAUTIFUL FAIRY THE FAIRY WHO BROUGHT ME HERE FIRST TOOK AWAY MY SIGHT
AND AS HE HAD NO HAIR AND VERY LONG EARS HE LOOKED ALTOGETHER A SHOCKING LITTLE OBJECT I AM DELIGHTED
REFUSE TO AID BELLISSIMA DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE ASKING SAID THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT FROWNING AND LOOKING AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY DO YOU WANT ME TO EMPLOY MY ART AGAINST THE YELLOW DWARF WHO IS MY BEST FRIEND
DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE A DWARF THAT YOU ARE SO UGLY THAT ONE CANNOT BEAR TO LOOK AT YOU AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE KILLED YOU MYSELF LONG BEFORE THIS IF YOU HAD BEEN WORTHY OF SUCH A GLORIOUS DEATH
HE SAW HIS BELOVED PRINCESS IN A CASTLE BUILT OF POLISHED STEEL THE WALLS OF WHICH REFLECTED THE SUN'S RAYS SO HOTLY THAT NO ONE COULD APPROACH IT WITHOUT BEING BURNT TO A CINDER
AS SOON AS HE LOST SIGHT OF ME BUT WHO CAN MY RIVAL BE WHOSE FATAL BEAUTY IS GREATER THAN MINE WHILE SHE WAS SAYING THIS THE KING WHO REALLY LOVED HER AS MUCH AS EVER
WAS ABOUT BELLISSIMA FOR THAT WAS THE PRINCESS'S NAME AND ALL THE BONFIRES THAT THEY HAD WERE MADE OF THESE VERSES WHICH CRACKLED AND SPARKLED BETTER THAN ANY OTHER SORT OF WOOD BELLISSIMA WAS ALREADY FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
AS THROUGH THIS ENCHANTED LAND
I SHALL BE EATEN UP AND BEING TOO FRIGHTENED TO RUN A SINGLE STEP SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND LEANED AGAINST THE TREE UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ASLEEP
STIRRED BY WILD WINDS FROM DEPTH TO HEIGHT THOU HOLD'ST MY LOVED ONE FAR FROM ME AND I AM CAPTIVE TO THY MIGHT MY HEART IS STILL MORE WILD THAN THINE
THE QUEEN CAUSED HER PORTRAIT TO BE TAKEN BY THE CLEVEREST PAINTERS AND SENT IT TO SEVERAL NEIGHBORING KINGS WITH WHOM SHE WAS VERY FRIENDLY
THE KING SIGHED BUT MADE NO ANSWER INDEED WHAT WAS THERE TO BE SAID TO SUCH A CLEAR SIGHTED PERSON AT LAST THEY REACHED A VAST MEADOW GAY WITH ALL SORTS OF FLOWERS A DEEP RIVER SURROUNDED IT
AND AS MANY ELEGIES MADRIGALS AND SONGS WHICH WERE SENT HER BY ALL THE POETS IN THE WORLD
AND A LITTLE FURTHER ON WAS A TINY THATCHED COTTAGE OUT OF WHICH CAME THE YELLOW DWARF WITH A VERY JAUNTY AIR
JUST THAT HE MIGHT NOT FEEL THAT HE WAS A PRISONER BUT HE FELT SURE THAT SHE HAD NOT REALLY GONE QUITE AWAY BUT WAS WATCHING HIM FROM SOME HIDING PLACE SO WALKING UP TO A GREAT MIRROR HE SAID TO IT
GREW UP SO PROUD AND SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER OWN BEAUTY THAT SHE DESPISED EVERYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD THE QUEEN HER MOTHER BY HER CARESSES AND FLATTERIES HELPED TO MAKE HER BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO GOOD FOR HER
THIS CHANCE MEETING WITH AN UNHAPPY PRINCESS FOR WHOM I ONCE HAD A PASSING FANCY BEFORE I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO MEET YOU HAS AFFECTED ME A LITTLE I ADMIT BUT YOU ARE SO MUCH MORE TO ME THAN SHE IS THAT I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN LEAVE YOU
YOU HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF DYING UNMARRIED A LOVELY PRINCESS LIKE YOU MUST SURELY PREFER TO DIE RATHER THAN BE THE WIFE OF A POOR LITTLE DWARF LIKE MYSELF OH DON'T BE ANGRY WITH ME CRIED THE PRINCESS CLASPING HER HANDS
THE QUEEN WAS SO CONFUSED THAT AT FIRST SHE DID NOT NOTICE ANOTHER LITTLE DOOR IN THE ORANGE TREE BUT PRESENTLY IT OPENED AND SHE FOUND HERSELF IN A FIELD OF THISTLES AND NETTLES IT WAS ENCIRCLED BY A MUDDY DITCH
TO SEEK OUT EVERYTHING RARE AND PRECIOUS TO ADORN THE PRINCESS ALTHOUGH HER BEAUTY WAS SO PERFECT THAT NOTHING SHE WORE COULD MAKE HER LOOK PRETTIER AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES THOUGHT AND HE WAS NEVER HAPPY UNLESS HE WAS WITH HER
I AM TOO MUCH INTERESTED IN THE MATTER FOR HER TO PROMISE ANYTHING WITHOUT MY CONSENT YOU MUST BE MISTAKEN BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS CRIED THE DWARF SUDDENLY
BUT I REALLY CANNOT ENDURE THE WAY IN WHICH SHE PROTECTS THE YELLOW DWARF AND KEEPS ME CHAINED HERE LIKE A CRIMINAL IT IS TRUE THAT I LOVE A CHARMING PRINCESS BUT IF THE FAIRY SHOULD SET ME FREE MY GRATITUDE WOULD OBLIGE ME TO LOVE HER ONLY
AND PERHAPS EVEN EMBARRASSED THE YELLOW DWARF HIMSELF BUT EVEN HIS COURAGE GAVE WAY WHEN HE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIS BELOVED PRINCESS FOR THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT LOOKING MORE TERRIBLE THAN BEFORE MOUNTED UPON A WINGED GRIFFIN
DO YOU REALLY MEAN WHAT YOU SAY PRINCE SAID THE FAIRY QUITE DECEIVED SURELY REPLIED THE PRINCE HOW COULD I DECEIVE YOU YOU SEE IT IS SO MUCH MORE FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BE LOVED BY A FAIRY THAN BY A SIMPLE PRINCESS
IF YOU HAD NOT NOTICED HOW MUCH I PITIED THESE PRINCES WHO WERE LEAVING ME FOR EVER BUT FOR YOU SIRE IT IS VERY DIFFERENT YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE PLEASED WITH ME
I SHALL PRETEND TO HATE HER UNTIL I AM SET FREE THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT QUITE TAKEN IN BY THESE WORDS RESOLVED AT ONCE TO TRANSPORT THE PRINCE TO A PLEASANTER PLACE
YOU HESITATE MADAM CRIED THE DWARF
AND FOR EVER MISERABLE CREATURE LEST I TAKE YOUR LIFE AND SO RID MYSELF OF YOUR MALICE HE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN THESE WORDS WHEN THE LID OF THE BOX FELL BACK ON THE FLOOR WITH A TERRIBLE NOISE
THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT HAD ALSO SEEN BELLISSIMA AND SHE TRIED TO READ IN THE KING'S EYES THE EFFECT THAT THIS UNEXPECTED SIGHT HAD HAD UPON HIM NO ONE CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU WISH TO KNOW BETTER THAN I CAN SAID HE
BUT BY HER VOICE I RECOGNIZED HER AS THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT THOUGH WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE CARRIED ME OFF FOR I CANNOT TELL YOU AH CRIED THE PRETENDED FAIRY IF YOU HAVE FALLEN INTO HER HANDS YOU WON'T GET AWAY UNTIL YOU HAVE MARRIED HER
DO WISH YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PROUD WHAT MAKES YOU DESPISE ALL THESE NICE KINGS I WISH YOU TO MARRY ONE OF THEM AND YOU DO NOT TRY TO PLEASE ME I AM SO HAPPY BELLISSIMA ANSWERED
WHAT ARE YOU CRYING ABOUT
SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS I WISHED TO TALK TO THE FAIRY DO NOT GIVE YOURSELF ANY FURTHER TROUBLE PRINCESS ANSWERED THE DWARF I CAN TELL YOU ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW BETTER THAN SHE COULD
I MUST MAKE UP MY MIND TO DIE SAID THE POOR QUEEN ALAS I SHOULD NOT CARE SO MUCH IF ONLY MY DEAR DAUGHTER WERE MARRIED OH YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER CRIED THE YELLOW DWARF
TRUSTY COUNSELLOR LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO MAKE MYSELF AGREEABLE TO THE CHARMING FAIRY OF THE DESERT FOR I CAN THINK OF NOTHING BUT HOW TO PLEASE HER AND HE AT ONCE SET TO WORK TO CURL HIS HAIR
THAT FAITHLESS PRINCESS WHO WOULD HAVE MARRIED YOU IS PROMISED TO ME SEE IF SHE HAS NOT UPON HER FINGER A RING MADE OF ONE OF MY HAIRS JUST TRY TO TAKE IT OFF
AND WITH LONG SNAKES COILED ROUND HER NECK HAD GIVEN HER SUCH A BLOW WITH THE LANCE SHE CARRIED THAT BELLISSIMA FELL INTO THE QUEEN'S ARMS BLEEDING AND SENSELESS HER FOND MOTHER FEELING AS MUCH HURT BY THE BLOW AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF
AND I MUST TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY ALREADY YOU SEE IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO DO IF YOU REALLY CARE FOR ME
WHAT DID YOU PROMISE YOURSELF THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES INDIGNANT AT BEING KEPT FROM HIS HAPPINESS BY THIS WICKED OLD WOMAN WENT UP TO HER AND THREATENING HER WITH HIS SWORD SAID GET AWAY OUT OF MY COUNTRY AT ONCE
BRINGING WITH THEM ROBERT OF ARTOIS WHO IS GRIEVOUSLY WOUNDED
MANY KNIGHTS WERE STRUCK THROUGH THE BARS OF THEIR VIZORS OR THE JOINTS OF THEIR MAIL THE HORSES THOUGH DEFENDED BY IRON TRAPPINGS
WHO SHOT SUCH A STORM OF BOLTS THAT GREAT NUMBERS OF THE DEFENDERS WERE KILLED THE ASSAULT WAS MADE AT A SCORE OF DIFFERENT POINTS AND THE GARRISON WAS TOO WEAK TO DEFEND ALL WITH SUCCESS
AS THEY FEARED TO CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY LEST THEY MIGHT FALL INTO THE HANDS OF SOME ROVING BAND OF FRENCH HORSE THEY WERE TOO DOG TIRED AND WERE ASLEEP A FEW MINUTES AFTER THEY LAY DOWN THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THEY AWOKE
THAT SOME FOOD BE PLACED BEFORE US OR WE SHALL HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE FRENCH ONLY TO DIE OF HUNGER HERE WE HAVE TASTED NOUGHT SINCE THE ATTACK ON VANNES BEGAN HAVE ANY BESIDE US ESCAPED
SAVE OUR OWN LITTLE BAND NOT ONE IN THE TOWN WILL LIFT A SWORD AGAIN SUCH RESISTANCE AS WE CAN OFFER WILL BUT INFLAME THEM TO FURY AND ALL THE HORRORS OF A SACK WILL BE INFLICTED UPON THE INHABITANTS THERE SHE IS POOR LADY ON THE TURRET
AND SWIM TO THE SIDE WITHOUT MAKING THE LEAST NOISE THEY MAY GIVE A FEW TURNS OF THE WINDLASS TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS HOLD OF THE ROPE BELOW BE SURE YOU DO NOT MAKE THE SLIGHTEST SPLASHING OR NOISE FOR THE SOUND WOULD BE HEARD ABOVE
AND PROPOSED TO HIS KNIGHTS TO SALLY FORTH AT ONCE AND DESTROY THE LARGEST OF THE ENEMY'S MACHINES WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP CLOSE TO THE WALLS IN A FEW MINUTES THE KNIGHTS WERE ARMED AND MOUNTED THREE HUNDRED KNIGHTS AND ESQUIRES WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE SORTIE
AND HENNEBON OF COURSE REMAINED IN THEIR POSSESSION
WHICH WILL LEAVE THREE OVER BUT WE HAD BETTER PLACE THEM A LITTLE OVER A YARD
CHAPTER TEN A PLACE OF REFUGE THE FRENCH EXCITED TO THE UTMOST BY THE EXHORTATIONS OF THEIR COMMANDERS AND BY THEIR DESIRE TO WIPE OUT THE DISGRACE
AND AT THE PROSPECT OF THE WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER WHICH WOULD ATTEND A STORM WHEN ALL HOPE OF A SUCCESSFUL RESISTANCE WAS AT AN END I FEAR WALTER SIR JOHN SAID ONE MORNING THAT THE END IS AT HAND
BESIDES THE GATES OF THE TOWN WILL STAND OPEN LATE FOR PEOPLE FROM THE VILLAGES ROUND WILL HAVE COME IN TO JOIN IN THE REVELS I AM READY TO TRY IT MASTER WALTER RALPH REPLIED FOR I ACHE FROM HEAD TO FOOT
GATHERED AROUND HIM SOME OF THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN A LEADING PART IN THE INTRIGUE THESE LEAVING THE CITY BY A GATE AT WHICH THEY HAD PLACED SOME OF THEIR OWN FACTION TO OPEN IT TO THE FRENCH ISSUED OUT AND MADE THEIR WAY TO THE ASSAILANTS CAMP
FOR WE MUST DIE HERE IF WE ARE NOT HAULED OUT I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T INTEND TO TRY AND CLIMB THAT ROPE I MIGHT DO TWENTY FEET OR SO ON A PINCH BUT I COULD NO MORE GET UP TO THE TOP THERE THAN I COULD FLY WE
THAT THEY COULD WITH DIFFICULTY DRAG THEIR LEGS ALONG UPON ENTERING THE TOWN WALTER MADE HIS WAY AT ONCE TO THE QUARTERS OF THE LEADER SIR WALTER HAD JUST RISEN AND WAS DELIGHTED AT THE SIGHT OF HIS ESQUIRE
THEN TURNING OFF FROM THE PRINCIPAL STREETS THEY MADE THEIR WAY BY QUIET LANES DOWN TO ONE OF THE GATES TO THEIR DISMAY THEY FOUND THAT THIS WAS CLOSED THE FRENCH COMMANDERS KNEW THAT SIR WALTER MANNY OR SALISBURY
WHO HAD GONE OVER TO THE ENEMY
GAZING AS USUAL SEAWARD SUDDENLY THEY SAW HER THROW UP HER ARMS AND THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE CITY SHE CRIED AS SHE PERCEIVED THE ENGLISH KNIGHT I SEE THEM I SEE THEM THE ENGLISH FLEET ARE COMING RUN UP WALTER
COME WITH ME WALTER HE SAID WE MUST FAIN PERSUADE THE COUNTESS IF SHE SAYS NO WE ENGLISHMEN WILL DIE IN THE BREACH BUT THOUGH READY TO GIVE MY LIFE FOR SO BRAVE A LADY I OWN THAT IT IS USELESS TO FIGHT LONGER
AND I CANNOT KEEP OPENING AND CLOSING THE GATE
THERE WERE SIX STRANDS AND EACH HAS MADE SIX PIECES SO WE HAVE THIRTY SIX I KNOW THE WELL IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET DEEP
THE COUNTESS BEGGED FOR A LITTLE FURTHER DELAY BUT IN VAIN AND WITHDREW TO THE TURRET WHERE SHE HAD FOR SO MANY WEARY WEEKS WATCHED THE HORIZON IN HOPES OF SEEING THE SAILS OF THE APPROACHING FLEET WALTER WAS AT THE TIME WITH SIR JOHN POWIS ON THE WALLS
WHO COMMANDED THE GARRISON OF VANNES SUPPORTED THE SIEGE WITH GREAT COURAGE AND FORTITUDE KNOWING THAT CHARLES OF BLOIS AND THE KING OF FRANCE WERE COLLECTING A GREAT ARMY FOR HIS RELIEF UNITING THEIR FORCES THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS THE TOWN
THEY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THEIR ASSAILANTS AND DASHED IN AT THE CASTLE GATE A CROWD OF THEIR ASSAILANTS WERE CLOSE UPON THEIR HEELS WALTER GLANCED ROUND DASHING ACROSS THE COURTYARD HE RAN THROUGH SOME PASSAGES INTO AN INNER YARD IN WHICH AS HE KNEW WAS THE WELL
SOME TRIED IN VAIN TO GAIN SHELTER IN THE HOUSES SIR JOHN POWIS'S BAND WAS SOON BROKEN AND SCATTERED AND THEIR LEADER SLAIN BY A HEAVY STONE FROM A HOUSETOP WALTER FOUGHT HIS WAY BLINDLY FORWARD TOWARDS THE CASTLE
AND WAS NOW WITH THE BESIEGING ARMY THE BESIEGERS DELIGHTED TO FIND AN ALLY WITHIN THE WALLS WHO MIGHT SAVE THEM FROM THE HEAVY LOSSES WHICH AN ASSAULT WOULD ENTAIL UPON THEM AT ONCE EMBRACED HIS OFFERS AND PROMISED HIM A LARGE RECOMPENSE
IF HE WOULD BRING OVER THE OTHER COMMANDERS AND NOBLES THE WILY BISHOP SET TO WORK AND THE CONSEQUENCES WERE SOON VISIBLE OPEN GRUMBLING BROKE FORTH AT THE HARDSHIPS WHICH WERE ENDURED
WHO WERE NEVER TIRED OF LISTENING TO HIS TALES OF THE WARS
THEY WERE TO BE FOLLOWED BY A STRONG BODY OF MEN AT ARMS AS SOON AS THE GATES WERE OPENED A NUMBER OF ARCHERS ISSUED OUT AND TAKING THEIR PLACE AT THE EDGE OF THE MOAT POURED A RAIN OF ARROWS UPON THE MEN WORKING THE MACHINE AND THOSE GUARDING IT MOST OF THESE
THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO CUT OFF THE SLACK OF THE ROPE THERE ARE SOME TWELVE FEET OF IT THEN WE WILL UNWIND THE STRANDS OF THAT THERE ARE FIVE OR SIX LARGE STRANDS AS FAR AS I CAN FEEL WE WILL CUT THEM UP INTO LENGTHS OF ABOUT A COUPLE OF FEET
UPON THE PART OF THE FRENCH HOWEVER CIRCUMSTANCES WERE OCCURRING WHICH RENDERED THEM ANXIOUS FOR A RELEASE FROM THEIR POSITION
WE SHALL EAT NOTHING TILL WE ARE WITHIN THE WALLS OF HENNEBON AND THAT WILL BE BY DAYLIGHT TOMORROW IF ALL GOES WELL DRAW YOUR BELT AN INCH OR TWO TIGHTER IT WILL HELP TO KEEP OUT THE WOLF
AND THE TWO PUTTING ON THE STEEL CAPS AND CLOAKS WALKED QUIETLY TO THE GATE THERE WERE NONE ON GUARD AND THEY ISSUED UNMOLESTED INTO THE TOWN
TO GET AT THE WINE BUTTS TO TROUBLE THEIR HEADS ABOUT THE MATTER BESIDES IT MUST BE A HEAVY JOB TO WIND UP THIS BUCKET AND IT IS NOT LIKELY THERE WILL BE SUCH URGENT NEED OF WATER THAT ANYONE WILL UNDERTAKE THE TASK
YOU HAD BEST LIE DOWN BY THE FOOT OF THE WALL ANYONE WHO PASSES WILL THINK THAT YOU ARE IN A DRUNKEN SLEEP
IF I GET TIRED I WILL FASTEN ANOTHER LOOP BY THE SIDE OF THAT ON WHICH I AM RESTING SO YOU CAN COME UP AND PASS ME THERE IS NO HURRY IT OUGHT NOT TO TAKE UP ABOVE AN HOUR
WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY YOU KNOW WE WILL TAKE IT BY TURNS TO WATCH THAT LITTLE PATCH OF LIGHT OVERHEAD
BY WHICH IT WOULD NOT SLIP DOWN THE ROPE THEY MADE MANY FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS
IT SLID DOWN THE ROPE WHEN THEIR WEIGHT WAS APPLIED TO IT AT LAST THEY SUCCEEDED IN FINDING OUT A KNOT WHICH WOULD HOLD THIS WAS DONE BY TYING A KNOT CLOSE TO ONE END OF A PIECE OF THE STRAND THEN SUFFICIENT WAS LEFT TO FORM THE LOOP
WHICH CRUISED OFF THE COAST AND CAPTURED ALL VESSELS ARRIVING WITH STORES AT THIS MOMENT TWO LEGATES
AND THE CARDINAL BISHOP OF TUSCULUM ARRIVED FROM THE POPE AND STROVE TO MEDIATE BETWEEN THE TWO SOVEREIGNS AND TO BRING ABOUT A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES POINTING OUT TO THEM
THEY FOUND THE WORK LESS ARDUOUS THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED THE ROPE WAS DRY AND THE STRANDS HELD TIGHTLY TO IT TWO OR THREE TIMES THEY CHANGED PLACES RESTING IN TURN FROM THE WORK BUT IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS FROM THE TIME THEY MADE THE FIRST LOOP WALTER'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS
THE TIME NOW FOR A WHILE PASSED VERY QUIETLY WALTER AND THE OTHER YOUNG SQUIRES PRACTISED DILIGENTLY UNDER THE INSTRUCTIONS OF SIR WALTER AT KNIGHTLY EXERCISES WALTER LEARNED TO BEAR HIMSELF WELL ON HORSEBACK AND TO TILT IN THE RING
I WILL GO FIRST AT ANY RATE FOR A TIME I MUST PUT ONE LEG THROUGH THE LOOP AND SIT AS IT WERE WHILE I FASTEN THE ONE ABOVE AS I SHALL WANT BOTH HANDS FOR THE WORK YOU WILL FIND IT A GOOD DEAL EASIER TO STAND WITH YOUR FOOT IN THE LOOP
AND FORMED A LARGE ENTRENCHED CAMP NEAR THAT OF THE ENGLISH WHO THUS WHILE STILL BESIEGING VANNES WERE THEMSELVES ENCLOSED BY A VASTLY SUPERIOR FORCE THE KING OF FRANCE HIMSELF ARRIVED AT THE FRENCH CAMP THE FRENCH ALTHOUGH SO GREATLY SUPERIOR
AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TIE THESE TO THE ROPE IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT TO SLIP DOWN WITH OUR WEIGHT IF WE TIE THEM FOUR FEET APART
MANNED THE BREACHES AND REPULSED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER ALL ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE FRENCH TO CARRY THEM WHILE THE STRUGGLE WAS STILL GOING ON THE COUNTESS AIDED BY THE WIVES OF THE BURGHERS BUSIED HERSELF IN PREPARING A SUMPTUOUS FEAST IN HONOUR OF HER DELIVERERS
THEY ARE SATISFIED THAT IF WE DID JUMP DOWN HERE WE ARE DROWNED AND NOW WE MUST THINK ABOUT CLIMBING UP AYE THAT WILL REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF THINKING RALPH GRUMBLED FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS SILENCE THEN WALTER SAID
AS THEY SAW THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME GREAT BREACHES WOULD BE MADE IN THE WALLS AND THAT ALL THE HORRORS AND DISASTERS OF A CITY TAKEN BY ASSAULT AWAITED THEM THE BISHOP OF QUIMPER WHO WAS WITHIN THE WALLS ENTERED INTO SECRET NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIS NEPHEW
PRESENTLY THE OFFICER CAME OUT FROM THE GUARD ROOM AGAIN THERE WAS A FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE LITTLE CROWD AND WALTER AND RALPH CLOSED IN TO THEIR MIDST THE GATES WERE OPENED AND WITHOUT ANY QUESTION THE VILLAGERS PASSED OUT
TO THE MAIN BODY OF THEIR FORCES THEY HAD PLACED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEIR BEST TROOPS ON THE WALLS GIVING THEM A HANDSOME LARGESS TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR LOSS OF THE FESTIVITIES
WERE LEFT TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF HER PARTISANS WITH A SMALL BUT CHOICE BODY OF ENGLISH TROOPS THE TOWNS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO THEIR HANDS AND STILL REMAINED WERE BREST QUIMPER CORENTIN QUIMPERLE REDON
NO RALPH SAID MUCH MORE CHEERFULLY
BUT HAD EACH TIME BEEN REPULSED WITH VERY HEAVY LOSS THEY NOW SENT TO RENNES FOR TWELVE OF THE IMMENSE MACHINES USED IN BATTERING WALLS WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND THERE ON A FALSE REPORT OF THE WEAKNESS OF HENNEBON
AND STOOD BY ME AND TO WHOSE SUGGESTIONS I OWE IT THAT I WAS ABLE AT THE FIRST TO SALLY OUT AND DESTROY THE FRENCH CAMP WHILE THEY WERE ATTACKING THE WALLS AND SO GREATLY HINDERED THEIR MEASURES AGAINST THE TOWN AND NOW SIR WILL YOU FOLLOW ME
AND SIR JOHN POWIS THAT IT WAS AT HIS SUGGESTION THAT SHE HAD MADE THE SUDDEN ATTACK UPON THE FRENCH CAMP AND HE HAD GAINED GREAT CREDIT THEREBY THE EFFECT OF THE NEW MACHINES WAS SPEEDILY VISIBLE
AND BY DINT OF UNBUCKLING THE CLOAKS AND ROLLING THEIR WEARERS GENTLY OVER WALTER SUCCEEDED AT LAST IN OBTAINING TWO OF THEM HE ALSO PICKED UP A SWORD FOR RALPH HIS OWN STILL HUNG IN ITS SHEATH AND THEN HE JOINED HIS COMPANION
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS WELL TO HAVE BEEN KILLED AT ONCE THEY ARE SURE TO FIND US HERE AND IF THEY DON'T WE SHALL DIE OF COLD BEFORE TOMORROW MORNING I DON'T THINK THEY WILL FIND US WALTER SAID CHEERFULLY
AND TO BE PROLONGED FROM THAT DAY FOR THE FULL TERM OF THREE YEARS IT WAS AGREED THAT THE TRUCE SHOULD EMBRACE NOT ONLY THE SOVEREIGNS BUT ALL THE ADHERENTS OF EACH OF THEM THE TRUCE WAS TO HOLD GOOD IN BRITTANY BETWEEN ALL PARTIES
AND ALL THAT I CAN SAY TO KEEP UP THEIR SPIRITS IS USELESS UPON OUR OWN LITTLE BAND WE CAN RELY BUT I DOUBT IF OUTSIDE THEM A SINGLE DETERMINED MAN IS TO BE FOUND IN THE TOWN IN VAIN DO I SPEAK OF THE ARRIVAL OF SIR WALTER MANNY
YOU ARE DOING WELL YOUNG SIR THE ENGLISH LEADER WENT ON AND HAVE DISTINGUISHED YOURSELF ON EACH OCCASION ON WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED I SHALL BE PROUD
IN OCTOBER KING EDWARD HIMSELF SET SAIL WITH A GREAT ARMY AND LANDING IN BRITTANY EARLY IN NOVEMBER MARCHED FORWARD THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND SOON REDUCED PLOERMEL MALESTRAIL REDON
IN A FEW DAYS THESE ARRIVED AND WERE SPEEDILY SET TO WORK AND IMMENSE MASSES OF STONE WERE HURLED AT THE WALLS WALTER CONTINUED TO ACT AS THE COUNTESS'S ESPECIAL SQUIRE SHE HAD INFORMED SIR WILLIAM CADDOUDAL
WHO SEEING THAT SUCH POWERFUL AID HAD ARRIVED FOR THE CAUSE OF THE COUNTESS OF MONTFORD WERE EASILY PERSUADED TO CHANGE SIDES AMONG THEM WERE THE LORDS OF CLISSON
KING EDWARD HOWEVER FELT THAT HIS POSITION WAS GROWING DESPERATE FOR STARVATION WAS STARING HIM IN THE FACE AND ONLY BY A VICTORY OVER AN IMMENSELY SUPERIOR FORCE IN A STRONGLY ENTRENCHED POSITION COULD HE EXTRICATE HIMSELF
AND THE GATES WERE SHUT INSTANTLY BEHIND THEM WALTER AND HIS COMRADE AT ONCE STARTED AT A BRISK PACE
AND THEIR ENCAMPMENT WAS FLOODED THEIR FORCES WERE THEREFORE OBLIGATED TO SPREAD THEMSELVES OVER THE NEIGHBOURING FIELDS AND A SUDDEN ATTACK BY THE ENGLISH MIGHT HAVE BEEN FATAL THUS DISTRESS PRESSED UPON BOTH COMMANDERS
THE ENGLISH FLEET IS IN SIGHT MANY OTHERS HEARD THE SHOUT AND THE TIDINGS RAN LIKE LIGHTNING THROUGH THE TOWN IN WILD EXCITEMENT THE PEOPLE RAN TO THE BATTLEMENTS AND ROOFS AND WITH CHEERING
SIR JOHN EXCLAIMED MAYBE THE COUNTESS IS DISTRAUGHT WITH HER SORROWS WALTER DASHED UP TO THE TURRET AND LOOKING SEAWARD BEHELD RISING OVER THE HORIZON A NUMBER OF MASTS HURRAH SIR JOHN HE SHOUTED WE ARE SAVED
THAN DROP DOWN INTO THE DEEP HOLE OF THAT WELL AND YOUR BRAINS SERVED YOU SHREWDLY IN DEVISING A METHOD OF ESCAPE WHAT SAY YOU GENTLEMEN ALL PRESENT JOINED IN EXPRESSIONS OF PRAISE AT THE LAD'S COOLNESS AND PRESENCE OF MIND
SLAYING ALL WHOM THEY ENCOUNTERED ALL IS LOST SIR JOHN EXCLAIMED LET US FALL BACK TO THE CASTLE AND DIE FIGHTING THERE DESCENDING FROM THE WALL THE PARTY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE STREETS THE FRENCH WERE ALREADY IN THE TOWN
THE SCANDAL AND DESOLATION WHICH THEIR RIVALRY CAUSED IN CHRISTENDOM THE WASTE OF NOBLE LIVES THE DEVASTATION OF ONCE HAPPY PROVINCES AND THE EFFUSION OF INNOCENT BLOOD GOING FROM CAMP TO CAMP THEY EXHORTED
IN THE DIRECTION OF HENNEBON THEIR CLOTHES SOON DRIED AND ELATED AT THEIR ESCAPE FROM DANGER THEY STRUGGLED ON BRISKLY WHEN MORNING BROKE THEY ENTERED A WOOD AND LAY THERE TILL EVENING
THE BUCKET HUNG AT THE WINDLASS CATCH HOLD RALPH HE EXCLAIMED
I HAVE PREPARED FOR YOU AND YOUR KNIGHTS SUCH A BANQUET OF WELCOME AS OUR POOR MEANS WILL ALLOW AND MY TOWNSPEOPLE WILL SEE THAT GOOD FARE IS SET BEFORE YOUR SOLDIERS
WHILE THE ENGLISH ARMY LAY ON A HILL THE FRENCH CAMP WAS PITCHED ON LOW GROUND AN UNUSUALLY WET SEASON HAD SET IN WITH BITTERLY COLD WIND THE RAIN WAS INCESSANT A PESTILENCE HAD DESTROYED A VAST NUMBER OF THEIR HORSES
THE WALLS CRUMBLED UNDER THE TREMENDOUS BLOWS AND ALTHOUGH THE ARCHERS HARASSED BY THEIR ARROWS THE MEN WORKING THEM THE FRENCH SPEEDILY ERECTED SCREENS WHICH SHELTERED THEM FROM THEIR FIRE THE SPIRITS OF THE DEFENDERS BEGAN TO SINK RAPIDLY
AND WALKING ALL NIGHT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH IT DOES NOT SUIT ME AT ALL I FEEL RAVENOUS TOO RALPH
AND THE CITY OF VANNES WAS TO BE GIVEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE CARDINALS TO DISPOSE OF AS THEY CHOSE IT WAS SPECIALLY PROVIDED
AND IT WILL NOT DO FOR US TO GET TO THE TOP UNTIL THE PLACE BECOMES A LITTLE QUIET TONIGHT THEY ARE SURE TO BE DRINKING AND FEASTING OVER THEIR VICTORY UNTIL LATE THEY NOW SET TO WORK AND STEP BY STEP MOUNTED THE ROPE
THE ARRIVAL OF THE REINFORCEMENTS AND THE PROOF OF SKILL AND VIGOUR GIVEN BY THE ENGLISH LEADER TOGETHER WITH THE TERROR CAUSED BY THE TERRIBLE EFFECT OF THE ENGLISH ARROWS SHOOK THE RESOLUTION OF DON LOUIS AND HIS TROOPS
THAT EVENING THERE WAS HIGH FEASTING IN THE TOWN ALTHOUGH THE CRASH OF THE HEAVY STONES CAST BY THE FRENCH MACHINES AGAINST THE WALLS NEVER CEASED EARLY THE NEXT MORNING SIR WALTER MANNY MADE A SURVEY OF THE PLACE AND OF THE DISPOSITION OF THE ENEMY
EVERY HOUSE WAS CLOSED AND BARRED AND FROM THE UPPER WINDOWS THE BURGHERS HURLED DOWN STONES AND BRICKS UPON THE FUGITIVES WHILE PARTIES OF THE FRENCH SOLDIERS FELL UPON THEM FIERCELY MANY THREW DOWN THEIR ARMS AND CRIED FOR QUARTER BUT WERE INSTANTLY SLAIN
THE KNIGHTS WHEELED AND PRESENTED A FIRM FACE TO THE ENEMY COVERING THE ENTRANCE OF THEIR FOLLOWERS INTO THE GATE THE FRENCH CHIVALRY THUNDERED DOWN UPON THE LITTLE BODY
ON THE NINETEENTH OF JANUARY THIRTEEN FORTY THREE THE KING OF FRANCE DISMISSED HIS ARMY AND EDWARD SAILED FOR ENGLAND WITH THE GREATER PART OF HIS TROOPS THE COUNTESS OF MONTFORD AND HER SON ACCOMPANIED HIM AND THE POSSESSIONS OF HER HUSBAND IN BRITTANY
TO RECONNOITRE THE COUNTRY AND CLEAR IT OF ANY SMALL BODIES OF THE ENEMY THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER IN THE MEANTIME EDWARD OPENED NEGOTIATIONS WITH MANY OF THE BRETON LORDS
WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIS HUNGER THE YOUNG ESQUIRE RELATED HIS ADVENTURES TO SIR WALTER AND SEVERAL OTHER KNIGHTS AND NOBLES WHO HAD BY THIS TIME GATHERED IN THE ROOM IN FAITH MASTER SOMERS
HAVE MADE THEIR WAY HERE IN A FEW MINUTES A COLD CAPON SEVERAL MANCHETS OF BREAD AND A STOOP OF WINE WERE PLACED BEFORE WALTER WHILE RALPH'S WANTS WERE ATTENDED TO BELOW
THEY ALONE REMAINED STEADFAST WHEN ALL OTHERS FELL AWAY AND IT IS DUE TO THEM THAT I AM STILL ABLE AS MISTRESS OF THIS TOWN TO GREET YOU ON YOUR ARRIVAL NEXT TO SIR JOHN HIMSELF
EVERYONE IS INTENT ON HIS OWN PLEASURE AND WE SHALL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN SLIPPING OUT OF THE CASTLE UNNOTICED
SIR JOHN POWIS AND HIS PARTY REPULSED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE EFFORTS OF THE ASSAILANTS AGAINST THAT PART OF THE WALL ENTRUSTED TO THEM BUT AT OTHER POINTS THE FRENCH GAINED A FOOTING AND SWARMING UP RUSHED ALONG THE WALLS
AND AS SOON AS IT WAS DARK THEY RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL MASTER WALTER BUT I AM WELL NIGH FAMISHED IT IS THIRTY SIX HOURS SINCE I SWALLOWED A BIT OF FOOD
NEARLY NINETY DAYS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE WE SAILED AND ALL HOPE OF HIS COMING IS GONE I POINT OUT TO THEM THAT CONTRARY WINDS HAVE BEEN BLOWING AND THAT AT ANY MOMENT HE MAY ARRIVE BUT THEY WILL NOT HEAR ME
APPEARED ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE COURTYARD HE COULD HEAR SOUNDS OF SHOUTING AND SINGING WITHIN THE CASTLE AND KNEW THAT A GREAT FEAST WAS GOING ON DESCENDING A STEP OR TWO HE HELD PARLEY WITH RALPH
WHEN THE TIME COMES TO BESTOW UPON YOU MYSELF THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD IF OUR KING DOES NOT TAKE THE MATTER OFF MY HANDS A LITTLE LATER ROBERT OF ARTOIS DIED OF HIS WOUNDS AND DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE FAILURE OF HIS HOPES
BEFORE THAT TIME ELAPSED SOME FIFTY OR SIXTY PEOPLE ANXIOUS TO RETURN TO THEIR VILLAGES GATHERED ROUND THE GATE BEST LAY ASIDE YOUR STEEL CAP RALPH BEFORE WE JOIN THEM WALTER SAID IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THAT LAMP
WHO SUMMONED THE TOWN TO SURRENDER MANY STANDING ON THE WALLS SHOUTED THAT THE GATES SHOULD BE THROWN OPEN BUT SIR JOHN RETURNED FOR ANSWER THAT HE MUST CONSULT THE COUNTESS AND THAT UPON HER ANSWER MUST DEPEND WHETHER HE AND HIS MEN WOULD DEFEND THE BREACH UNTIL THE LAST
WHEN THEY HAVE SEARCHED THE CASTLE THOROUGHLY IT MAY OCCUR TO SOME OF THEM THAT WE HAVE JUMPED DOWN THE WELL BUT IT WILL BE NO PARTICULAR BUSINESS OF ANYONE TO LOOK FOR US AND THEY WILL ALL BE TOO ANXIOUS
ADVANCED WITH ARDOUR TO THE ASSAULT AND OFFICERS AND MEN VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN THE VALOUR WHICH THEY DISPLAYED IN VAIN DID THE GARRISON SHOWER ARROWS AND CROSS BOW BOLTS AMONG THEM AND POUR DOWN BURNING OIL AND QUICKLIME UPON THEM
I HAD GIVEN YOU UP FOR LOST WE THOUGHT YOU HAD GONE DOWN IN THE GALE THE NIGHT YOU STARTED WE WERE SEPARATED FROM THE FLEET SIR WALTER BUT THE MASTER HELD ON AND WE ARRIVED HERE FOUR DAYS AFTER WE PUT OUT WE TOOK PART IN THE SIEGE OF RENNES
WITH HOLDING ON TO THIS ROPE THE SOONER THE BETTER SAY I IN ANOTHER MINUTE BOTH STOOD IN THE COURTYARD IT WAS A RETIRED SPOT AND NONE WERE PASSING GOING ALONG THE PASSAGE THEY ISSUED INTO THE MAIN YARD HERE GREAT FIRES WERE BLAZING
BEFORE THE FORCE OF THE FRENCH FORTY THOUSAND STRONG THE EARL OF NORFOLK HAD FALLEN BACK AND REJOINED THE KING BUT EVEN AFTER THIS JUNCTION THE FRENCH FORCES EXCEEDED THOSE OF EDWARD FOURFOLD THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS VANNES
WHO WERE FAST APPROACHING THEIR SHIPS IMPELLED BY A STRONG AND FAVOURABLE BREEZE THE VESSELS OF THE FRENCH HASTILY DREW OFF AND THE ENGLISH FLEET SAILED INTO THE PORT HAILED BY THE CHEERS OF THE INHABITANTS THE COUNTESS HERSELF RECEIVED SIR WALTER MANNY
CUT DOWN ALL WHO OPPOSED THEM AND SETTING FIRE TO THE HUTS RETIRED TOWARDS THE CITY BY THIS TIME THE FRENCH WERE THOROUGHLY ALARMED AND NUMBERS OF KNIGHTS AND MEN AT ARMS DASHED AFTER THE LITTLE BODY OF ENGLISH CAVALRY
THE BISHOP HAS GAINED OVER THE WHOLE OF THEM BY HIS PROMISES THAT NONE SHALL BE MOLESTED IN PROPERTY OR ESTATE SHOULD THEY SURRENDER IT IS SAD TO SEE THE COUNTESS WALTER REPLIED SHE WHO HAS SHOWN SUCH HIGH SPIRIT THROUGHOUT THE SIEGE
NOW DOES NOTHING BUT WEEP FOR SHE KNOWS THAT WITH HER AND HER CHILD IN THE HANDS OF THE FRENCH THE CAUSE OF THE COUNT IS LOST IF SHE COULD CARRY OFF THE CHILD BY SEA SHE WOULD NOT SO MUCH CARE FOR THE FALL OF THE TOWN BUT THE FRENCH SHIPS LIE THICK ROUND THE PORT
AND THE REST OF THE PROVINCE IN THE VICINITY OF VANNES AND THEN LAID SIEGE TO THAT TOWN AS HIS FORCE WAS FAR MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR THE SIEGE THE EARLS OF NORFOLK AND WARWICK WERE DESPATCHED IN THE DIRECTION OF NANTES
JUST AS THE FRENCH WERE MOVING TO THE ATTACK HARD BLOWS I DON'T MIND I HAVE BEEN USED TO IT BUT WHAT WITH FIGHTING AND BEING IN THE WATER FOR FIVE OR SIX HOURS AND CLIMBING UP THAT ENDLESS ROPE
THEN THOUGH IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING THEY HEARD THE BUCKET LIFTED FROM THE WATER A MINUTE LATER IT FELL BACK AGAIN WITH A SPLASH
AND GROUPS OF MEN SAT ROUND THEM DRINKING AND SHOUTING MANY LAY ABOUT IN DRUNKEN SLEEP
THE VIBRATION OF THE ROPE WHEN OUR WEIGHT ONCE GETS ON IT MIGHT BE NOTICED BY ANYONE CROSSING THE COURTYARD DO YOU THINK WE HAVE SUFFICIENT BITS OF ROPE RALPH ASKED JUST ENOUGH I THINK WALTER REPLIED
WITH GREAT EFFORTS THEY MANAGED TO RID THEMSELVES OF THEIR ARMOUR AND THEN HELD ON WITH EASE TO THE ROPE THEY HAULED THE BUCKET TO THE SURFACE AND TIED A KNOT IN THE SLACK OF THE ROPE SO THAT THE BUCKET HUNG FOUR FEET BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE WATER
TO GIVE NEWS OF THE ALTERED SITUATION DON LOUIS AT ONCE ORDERED AN ATTACK TO BE MADE WITH HIS WHOLE FORCE IN HOPES OF CAPTURING THE PLACE BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE ENGLISH SUCCOUR BUT ANIMATED BY THEIR NEW HOPES THOSE SO LATELY DESPONDENT AND READY TO YIELD
IN A SHORT TIME THE FADING BRIGHTNESS OF THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT FAR OVERHEAD TOLD THEM THAT TWILIGHT HAD COMMENCED AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THEY ATTACHED THE FIRST STRAND TO THE ROPE SOME THREE FEET ABOVE THE WATER NOW WALTER SAID
ON HIS LANDING AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN OFFERING HOSPITALITY TO THE MEN AT ARMS AND ARCHERS AH SIR JOHN POWIS SIR WALTER EXCLAIMED WHAT
AND HAVE SINCE DONE OUR BEST TO AID THE COUNTESS HERE AND THEIR BEST HAS BEEN MUCH THE COUNTESS SAID NOT TO SAY HOW BRAVELY THEY HAVE FOUGHT UPON THE WALLS IT IS TO SIR JOHN AND HIS LITTLE BAND THAT I OWE IT THAT THE TOWN WAS NOT SURRENDERED DAYS AGO
AND MANY ON BOTH SIDES WERE OVERTHROWN THEN AS LARGE REINFORCEMENTS WERE CONTINUALLY ARRIVING TO THE FRENCH SIR WALTER CALLED OFF HIS MEN AND RETIRED SLOWLY ON REACHING THE MOAT HE HALTED HIS FORCES
CHAPTER NINE THE SIEGE OF HENNEBON THE BESIEGERS OF HENNEBON WERE GREATLY DISCOURAGED AT THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE OF THE COUNTESS THEY HAD ALREADY ATTEMPTED SEVERAL DESPERATE ASSAULTS
ON WHICH MURDERS BY THE WAY I MUST OBSERVE THAT IN ONE RESPECT THEY HAVE HAD AN ILL EFFECT BY MAKING THE CONNOISSEUR IN MURDER VERY FASTIDIOUS IN HIS TASTE
FIFTY REPLIED THE LATTER ALL RIGHT FIFTY IMPERIALS THAT I WILL DRINK A WHOLE BOTTLE OF RUM WITHOUT TAKING IT FROM MY MOUTH SITTING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW ON THIS SPOT
DOLOKHOV CLIMBED CAREFULLY AND SLOWLY THROUGH THE WINDOW AND LOWERED HIS LEGS PRESSING AGAINST BOTH SIDES OF THE WINDOW HE ADJUSTED HIMSELF ON HIS SEAT
PIERRE STOOD SMILING BUT SILENT ONE MAN OLDER THAN THE OTHERS PRESENT SUDDENLY PUSHED FORWARD WITH A SCARED AND ANGRY LOOK AND WANTED TO SEIZE HOLD OF DOLOKHOV'S SHIRT I SAY THIS IS FOLLY HE'LL BE KILLED SAID THIS MORE SENSIBLE MAN
THE MORE HE FELT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF GOING TO SLEEP ON SUCH A NIGHT
HIS UNDERSTANDING WHICH INCLUDES NO INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAWS OF VISION CAN FURNISH HIM WITH NO REASON WHY A LINE WHICH IS KNOWN AND CAN BE PROVED TO BE A HORIZONTAL LINE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A HORIZONTAL LINE
ALL STRIFE OF THOUGHT ALL FLUX AND REFLUX OF PASSION AND OF PURPOSE ARE CRUSHED BY ONE OVERWHELMING PANIC THE FEAR OF INSTANT DEATH SMITES HIM WITH ITS PETRIFIC MACE
IN WHICH NOT ONLY THE UNDERSTANDING IS ALLOWED TO OVERRULE THE EYES BUT WHERE THE UNDERSTANDING IS POSITIVELY ALLOWED TO OBLITERATE THE EYES AS IT WERE
SOME EIGHT OR NINE YOUNG MEN WERE CROWDING ANXIOUSLY ROUND AN OPEN WINDOW THREE OTHERS WERE ROMPING WITH A YOUNG BEAR ONE PULLING HIM BY THE CHAIN AND TRYING TO SET HIM AT THE OTHERS I BET A HUNDRED ON STEVENS SHOUTED ONE
I'LL DO THE SAME THING HE SUDDENLY CRIED EVEN WITHOUT A BET THERE TELL THEM TO BRING ME A BOTTLE I'LL DO IT BRING A BOTTLE LET HIM DO IT LET HIM DO IT SAID DOLOKHOV SMILING WHAT NEXT HAVE YOU GONE MAD NO ONE WOULD LET YOU WHY
BENEATH THE TALLNESS OF THE STONE PINES WHAT A BEAUTIFUL THING THE STONE PINE IS NO WE NEVER DID GO BACK ANYWHERE NOT TO HEIDELBERG NOT TO HAMELIN NOT TO VERONA NOT TO MONT MAJOUR
HE DESIRED SO PASSIONATELY ONCE MORE TO ENJOY THAT DISSIPATION HE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THAT HE DECIDED TO GO THE THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HIS PROMISE TO PRINCE ANDREW WAS OF NO ACCOUNT
AND THE MOST TO BE DISTRUSTED AND YET THE GREAT MAJORITY OF PEOPLE TRUST TO NOTHING ELSE WHICH MAY DO FOR ORDINARY LIFE BUT NOT FOR PHILOSOPHICAL PURPOSES OF THIS OUT OF TEN THOUSAND INSTANCES THAT I MIGHT PRODUCE
DEEP DAMNATION OF HIS TAKING OFF THIS WAS TO BE EXPRESSED WITH PECULIAR ENERGY
TO REPRESENT THE EFFECT OF TWO WALLS STANDING AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER OR THE APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSES ON EACH SIDE OF A STREET AS SEEN BY A PERSON LOOKING DOWN THE STREET FROM ONE EXTREMITY NOW IN ALL CASES
YOU ARE SO SILENT YOU DON'T TELL ME ANYTHING I AM AT ANY RATE TRYING TO GET YOU TO SEE WHAT SORT OF LIFE IT WAS I LED WITH FLORENCE AND WHAT FLORENCE WAS LIKE WELL SHE WAS BRIGHT AND SHE DANCED
NOT SO MUCH AS TO CARCASSONNE ITSELF WE TALKED OF IT OF COURSE BUT I GUESS FLORENCE GOT ALL SHE WANTED OUT OF ONE LOOK AT A PLACE SHE HAD THE SEEING EYE I HAVEN'T UNFORTUNATELY SO THAT THE WORLD IS FULL OF PLACES TO WHICH I WANT TO RETURN
DOLOKHOV COULD PLAY ALL GAMES AND NEARLY ALWAYS WON HOWEVER MUCH HE DRANK HE NEVER LOST HIS CLEARHEADEDNESS BOTH KURAGIN AND DOLOKHOV WERE AT THAT TIME NOTORIOUS AMONG THE RAKES AND SCAPEGRACES OF PETERSBURG
THAT WHICH HE HAS SEEN EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE BUT TO RETURN FROM THIS DIGRESSION MY UNDERSTANDING
SHE WOULD TALK ABOUT WILLIAM THE SILENT ABOUT GUSTAVE THE LOQUACIOUS ABOUT PARIS FROCKS ABOUT HOW THE POOR DRESSED IN THIRTEEN THIRTY SEVEN ABOUT FANTIN LATOUR
BENEATH THE HIGH THIN LEAVED ELMS THE FIRST QUESTION THEY ASKED ME WAS NOT HOW I DID BUT WHAT DID I DO AND I DID NOTHING
IT SEEMS ALMOST LUDICROUS TO GUARD AND EXPLAIN MY USE OF A WORD IN A SITUATION WHERE IT WOULD NATURALLY EXPLAIN ITSELF BUT IT HAS BECOME NECESSARY TO DO SO IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE UNSCHOLARLIKE USE OF THE WORD SYMPATHY
AT PRESENT SO GENERAL BY WHICH INSTEAD OF TAKING IT IN ITS PROPER SENSE AS THE ACT OF REPRODUCING IN OUR MINDS THE FEELINGS OF ANOTHER WHETHER FOR HATRED INDIGNATION LOVE PITY OR APPROBATION
TOWNS WITH THE BLINDING WHITE SUN UPON THEM STONE PINES AGAINST THE BLUE OF THE SKY CORNERS OF GABLES ALL CARVED AND PAINTED WITH STAGS AND SCARLET FLOWERS AND CROWSTEPPED GABLES WITH THE LITTLE SAINT AT THE TOP
I KNOW I WAS FOR DO YOU UNDERSTAND MY WHOLE ATTENTIONS MY WHOLE ENDEAVOURS WERE TO KEEP POOR DEAR FLORENCE ON TO TOPICS LIKE THE FINDS AT CNOSSOS AND THE MENTAL SPIRITUALITY OF WALTER PATER
HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE HAS SEEN
MIND NO HOLDING ON CRIED ANOTHER I BET ON DOLOKHOV CRIED A THIRD KURAGIN YOU PART OUR HANDS THERE LEAVE BRUIN ALONE HERE'S A BET ON AT ONE DRAUGHT OR HE LOSES SHOUTED A FOURTH JACOB BRING A BOTTLE SHOUTED THE HOST
HE HAD TOLD THE GIRL AND THE GIRL TOLD THE WIFE I ARRIVED HOWEVER TOO LATE TO BE OF ANY GOOD IF I COULD HAVE BEEN OF ANY GOOD AND THEN I HAD MY FIRST TASTE OF ENGLISH LIFE IT WAS AMAZING IT WAS OVERWHELMING
STOOD ON THE TOP DOORSTEP WITH A BUTLER AND FOOTMAN AND A MAID OR SO BEHIND HER AND SHE JUST SAID SO GLAD YOU'VE COME AS IF I'D RUN DOWN TO LUNCH FROM A TOWN TEN MILES AWAY INSTEAD OF HAVING COME HALF THE WORLD OVER AT THE CALL OF TWO URGENT TELEGRAMS
THAT IS WHAT MAKES ME THINK OF THAT FELLOW PEIRE VIDAL BECAUSE OF COURSE HIS STORY IS CULTURE AND I HAD TO HEAD HER TOWARDS CULTURE AND AT THE SAME TIME IT'S SO FUNNY AND SHE HADN'T GOT TO LAUGH AND IT'S SO FULL OF LOVE AND SHE WASN'T TO THINK OF LOVE
THESE FELLOWS MUST BE VERY LONELY LET'S TAKE THEM SOME ORANGES SO HE HAD A BOATLOAD OF HIS FRUIT OUT AND HAD HIMSELF ROWED TO THE LIGHTHOUSE ON THE HORIZON THE FOLDING CHAIRS HE LENT TO ANY LADY THAT HE CAME ACROSS AND LIKED OR WHO SEEMED TIRED AND INVALIDISH ON THE SHIP
THE GIRL WAS OUT WITH THE HOUNDS I THINK AND THAT POOR DEVIL BESIDE ME WAS IN AN AGONY
ANATOLE BROUGHT TWO CANDLES AND PLACED THEM ON THE WINDOW SILL THOUGH IT WAS ALREADY QUITE LIGHT DOLOKHOV'S BACK IN HIS WHITE SHIRT AND HIS CURLY HEAD WERE LIT UP FROM BOTH SIDES EVERYONE CROWDED TO THE WINDOW THE ENGLISHMAN IN FRONT
AT LENGTH IN EIGHTEEN TWELVE MISTER WILLIAMS MADE HIS DEBUT ON THE STAGE OF RATCLIFFE HIGHWAY AND EXECUTED THOSE UNPARALLELED MURDERS WHICH HAVE PROCURED FOR HIM SUCH A BRILLIANT AND UNDYING REPUTATION
IF ALL AT ONCE HE SHOULD HEAR THE DEATH LIKE STILLNESS BROKEN UP BY THE SOUND OF WHEELS RATTLING AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND MAKING KNOWN THAT THE TRANSITORY VISION WAS DISSOLVED HE WILL BE AWARE THAT AT NO MOMENT
HAVE A TALK WITH HIM AND IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS CAME ONE FROM LEONORA SAYING YES PLEASE DO COME YOU COULD BE SO HELPFUL IT WAS AS IF HE HAD SENT THE CABLE WITHOUT CONSULTING HER AND HAD AFTERWARDS TOLD HER INDEED THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH WHAT HAD HAPPENED EXCEPT THAT
THE BOTTLE OF RUM WAS BROUGHT THE WINDOW FRAME WHICH PREVENTED ANYONE FROM SITTING ON THE OUTER SILL WAS BEING FORCED OUT BY TWO FOOTMEN WHO WERE EVIDENTLY FLURRIED AND INTIMIDATED BY THE DIRECTIONS AND SHOUTS OF THE GENTLEMEN AROUND
EXHIBITS HUMAN NATURE IN ITS MOST ABJECT AND HUMILIATING ATTITUDE SUCH AN ATTITUDE WOULD LITTLE SUIT THE PURPOSES OF THE POET WHAT THEN MUST HE DO HE MUST THROW THE INTEREST ON THE MURDERER
ONE OF THE FOOTMEN WHO HAD STOOPED TO PICK UP SOME BROKEN GLASS REMAINED IN THAT POSITION WITHOUT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THE WINDOW AND FROM DOLOKHOV'S BACK ANATOLE STOOD ERECT WITH STARING EYES
NO I WON'T SAID PIERRE PUSHING ANATOLE ASIDE AND HE WENT UP TO THE WINDOW DOLOKHOV WAS HOLDING THE ENGLISHMAN'S HAND AND CLEARLY AND DISTINCTLY REPEATING THE TERMS OF THE BET ADDRESSING HIMSELF PARTICULARLY TO ANATOLE AND PIERRE
WHICH WILL CREATE A HELL WITHIN HIM AND INTO THIS HELL WE ARE TO LOOK FOOTNOTE ONE
FROM MY BOYISH DAYS I HAD ALWAYS FELT A GREAT PERPLEXITY ON ONE POINT IN MACBETH IT WAS THIS THE KNOCKING AT THE GATE WHICH SUCCEEDS TO THE MURDER OF DUNCAN
I MEAN THAT SHE DIDN'T LOOK AS IF SHE WERE SEEING POETIC DREAMS OR LOOKING THROUGH YOU FOR SHE HARDLY EVER DID LOOK AT YOU HOLDING UP ONE HAND AS IF SHE WISHED TO SILENCE ANY OBJECTION OR ANY COMMENT FOR THE MATTER OF THAT SHE WOULD TALK
DIFFERENT IN DEGREE AMONGST ALL LIVING CREATURES THIS INSTINCT THEREFORE BECAUSE IT ANNIHILATES ALL DISTINCTIONS AND DEGRADES THE GREATEST OF MEN TO THE LEVEL OF THE POOR BEETLE THAT WE TREAD ON
THIS TOGETHER WITH THE RESOLUTE INSOLENT INTELLIGENCE OF HIS EYES PRODUCED AN EFFECT WHICH MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO NOTICE HIS FACE DOLOKHOV WAS A MAN OF SMALL MEANS AND NO CONNECTIONS
OR SOMETHING SO EXTRAORDINARY MAY HAPPEN TO ONE THAT HONOR AND DISHONOR WILL BE ALL THE SAME PIERRE OFTEN INDULGED IN REFLECTIONS OF THIS SORT NULLIFYING ALL HIS DECISIONS AND INTENTIONS HE WENT TO KURAGIN'S
FOR NINE MONTHS OR SO IT WOULD MANUFACTURE BUTTONS OUT OF BONE THEN IT WOULD SUDDENLY PRODUCE BRASS BUTTONS FOR COACHMEN'S LIVERIES THEN IT WOULD TAKE A TURN AT EMBOSSED TIN LIDS FOR CANDY BOXES
BEGAN REPEATING THE TERMS OF THE WAGER TO HIM IN ENGLISH WAIT CRIED DOLOKHOV HAMMERING WITH THE BOTTLE ON THE WINDOW SILL TO ATTRACT ATTENTION WAIT A BIT KURAGIN LISTEN
AND GREY AND PINK PALAZZI AND WALLED TOWNS A MILE OR SO BACK FROM THE SEA ON THE MEDITERRANEAN BETWEEN LEGHORN AND NAPLES NOT ONE OF THEM DID WE SEE MORE THAN ONCE
WHICH IS IN THE BLACK MOUNTAINS IN THE MIDDLE OF A TORTUOUS VALLEY THERE RISES UP AN IMMENSE PINNACLE AND ON THE PINNACLE ARE FOUR CASTLES LAS TOURS THE TOWERS
I HAD TO KEEP HER AT IT YOU UNDERSTAND OR SHE MIGHT DIE FOR I WAS SOLEMNLY INFORMED THAT IF SHE BECAME EXCITED OVER ANYTHING OR IF HER
IF THE READER HAS EVER WITNESSED A WIFE DAUGHTER OR SISTER IN A FAINTING FIT
RELATION TO THINGS WITHOUT ABOLISHED AND ALL MUST PASS SELF WITHDRAWN INTO A DEEP SYNCOPE AND SUSPENSION OF EARTHLY PASSION HENCE IT IS THAT WHEN THE DEED IS DONE WHEN THE WORK OF DARKNESS IS PERFECT
A TALL HANDSOME FELLOW WHO STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THE GROUP WITHOUT A COAT AND WITH HIS FINE LINEN SHIRT UNFASTENED IN FRONT WAIT A BIT YOU FELLOWS HERE IS PETYA GOOD MAN CRIED HE ADDRESSING PIERRE
AND SHE WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM SO OUT OF COMPLIMENT TO HER THE THINGS PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY'RE IN LOVE HE DRESSED HIMSELF UP IN WOLFSKINS AND WENT UP INTO THE BLACK MOUNTAINS AND THE
THAT A STORY YOU HAVEN'T AN IDEA OF THE QUEER OLD FASHIONEDNESS OF FLORENCE'S AUNTS THE MISSES HURLBIRD NOR YET OF HER UNCLE AN EXTRAORDINARILY LOVABLE MAN THAT UNCLE JOHN
IT HAD CERTAINLY JUMPED OR SQUEAKED OR SOMETHING JUST SUFFICIENTLY TO TAKE IN THE DOCTORS BUT IT APPEARS THAT THAT WAS BECAUSE OF AN ODD FORMATION OF THE LUNGS I DON'T MUCH UNDERSTAND ABOUT THESE MATTERS
ARRANGED HIMSELF ON HIS SEAT IF ANYONE COMES MEDDLING AGAIN SAID HE EMITTING THE WORDS SEPARATELY THROUGH HIS THIN COMPRESSED LIPS I WILL THROW HIM DOWN THERE NOW THEN SAYING THIS HE AGAIN TURNED ROUND
DOLOKHOV WAS OF MEDIUM HEIGHT WITH CURLY HAIR AND LIGHT BLUE EYES HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE LIKE ALL INFANTRY OFFICERS HE WORE NO MUSTACHE SO THAT HIS MOUTH THE MOST STRIKING FEATURE OF HIS FACE WAS CLEARLY SEEN
HAIL STORM AND THUNDER WHICH ARE TO BE STUDIED WITH ENTIRE SUBMISSION OF OUR OWN FACULTIES AND IN THE PERFECT FAITH THAT IN THEM THERE CAN BE NO TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE NOTHING USELESS OR INERT
HE GAVE AN ORANGE EVERY MORNING AND THEY LASTED HIM RIGHT ROUND THE GIRDLE OF THIS MIGHTY GLOBE OF OURS WHEN THEY WERE AT NORTH CAPE EVEN HE SAW ON THE HORIZON POOR DEAR THIN MAN THAT HE WAS A LIGHTHOUSE
THERE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING DOING SINCE HIS TIME OR NOTHING THAT'S WORTH SPEAKING OF BUT THIS IS WRONG FOR IT IS UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT ALL MEN TO BE GREAT ARTISTS AND BORN WITH THE GENIUS OF MISTER WILLIAMS
FIRST RATE SAID PIERRE LOOKING AT DOLOKHOV WHO WITH A BOTTLE OF RUM IN HIS HAND WAS APPROACHING THE WINDOW FROM WHICH THE LIGHT OF THE SKY THE DAWN MERGING WITH THE AFTERGLOW OF SUNSET WAS VISIBLE DOLOKHOV THE BOTTLE OF RUM STILL IN HIS HAND
THE ENGLISHMAN TOOK OUT HIS PURSE AND BEGAN COUNTING OUT THE MONEY DOLOKHOV STOOD FROWNING AND DID NOT SPEAK PIERRE JUMPED UPON THE WINDOW SILL GENTLEMEN
ANATOLE WITH HIS SWAGGERING AIR STRODE UP TO THE WINDOW HE WANTED TO SMASH SOMETHING PUSHING AWAY THE FOOTMEN HE TUGGED AT THE FRAME BUT COULD NOT MOVE IT HE SMASHED A PANE
AND I AGAIN SET MYSELF TO STUDY THE PROBLEM AT LENGTH I SOLVED IT TO MY OWN SATISFACTION AND MY SOLUTION IS THIS MURDER
OUR SYMPATHY MUST BE WITH HIM OF COURSE I MEAN A SYMPATHY OF COMPREHENSION A SYMPATHY BY WHICH WE ENTER INTO HIS FEELINGS AND ARE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THEM
JUMPED ONTO THE WINDOW SILL LISTEN CRIED HE STANDING THERE AND ADDRESSING THOSE IN THE ROOM ALL WERE SILENT
FIFTY IMPERIALS HE SPOKE FRENCH THAT THE ENGLISHMAN MIGHT UNDERSTAND HIM BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK IT VERY WELL I BET FIFTY IMPERIALS OR DO YOU WISH TO MAKE IT A HUNDRED ADDED HE ADDRESSING THE ENGLISHMAN NO
UNLESS THE PERSON HAS HAPPENED TO OBSERVE IN PICTURES HOW IT IS THAT ARTISTS PRODUCE THESE EFFECTS HE WILL BE UTTERLY UNABLE TO MAKE THE SMALLEST APPROXIMATION TO IT YET WHY
THE FACT IS THAT THE POOR OLD GENTLEMAN WITH HIS WEAK AND FLUTTERING HEART DIDN'T WANT HIS FACTORY TO MANUFACTURE ANYTHING AT ALL HE WANTED TO RETIRE AND HE DID RETIRE WHEN HE WAS SEVENTY BUT HE WAS SO WORRIED AT HAVING ALL THE STREET BOYS IN THE TOWN POINT AFTER HIM AND EXCLAIM
AND I HAD TO APPOINT TRUSTEES I DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF THEIR NOT BEING PROPERLY HANDLED YES IT WAS A GREAT WORRY AND JUST AS I HAD GOT THINGS ROUGHLY SETTLED I RECEIVED THE EXTRAORDINARY CABLE FROM ASHBURNHAM BEGGING ME TO COME BACK AND
AND AS THIS EFFECT IS MARVELLOUSLY ACCOMPLISHED IN THE DIALOGUES AND SOLILOQUIES THEMSELVES SO IT IS FINALLY CONSUMMATED BY THE EXPEDIENT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND IT IS TO THIS THAT I NOW SOLICIT THE READER'S ATTENTION
THE ENGLISHMAN NODDED BUT GAVE NO INDICATION WHETHER HE INTENDED TO ACCEPT THIS CHALLENGE OR NOT ANATOLE DID NOT RELEASE HIM AND THOUGH HE KEPT NODDING TO SHOW THAT HE UNDERSTOOD ANATOLE WENT ON TRANSLATING DOLOKHOV'S WORDS INTO ENGLISH
THAT HE TRIED TAKING A TOUR ROUND THE WORLD AND FLORENCE AND A YOUNG MAN CALLED JIMMY WENT WITH HIM
THIN GENTLE AND WITH A HEART THAT MADE HIS LIFE VERY MUCH WHAT FLORENCE'S AFTERWARDS BECAME HE DIDN'T RESIDE AT STAMFORD HIS HOME WAS IN WATERBURY WHERE THE WATCHES COME FROM
A THIN YOUNG LAD AN HUSSAR OF THE LIFE GUARDS WHO HAD BEEN LOSING THAT EVENING CLIMBED ON THE WINDOW SILL LEANED OVER AND LOOKED DOWN OH OH OH HE MUTTERED
I'LL DRINK IT LET'S HAVE A BOTTLE OF RUM SHOUTED PIERRE BANGING THE TABLE WITH A DETERMINED AND DRUNKEN GESTURE AND PREPARING TO CLIMB OUT OF THE WINDOW
AND IT STRUCK HIM THAT THE THINGS TO TAKE FOR THAT PURPOSE WERE ORANGES BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS THE ORANGE COUNTRY AND COMFORTABLE FOLDING CHAIRS SO HE BOUGHT I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY CASES OF ORANGES THE GREAT COOL CALIFORNIA ORANGES
AND MADE SENSIBLE ANOTHER WORLD HAS STEPPED IN
HE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF INFLUENCE IN FORMING THE CHARACTER OF MY POOR DEAR WIFE JUST BEFORE THEY SET OUT FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR THE SOUTH SEAS
I DIDN'T SEE ANY CALL TO DO IT WHY DOES ONE DO THINGS I JUST DRIFTED IN AND WANTED FLORENCE
AND DISSATISFIED BY ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN SINCE DONE IN THAT LINE ALL OTHER MURDERS LOOK PALE BY THE DEEP CRIMSON OF HIS AND AS AN AMATEUR ONCE SAID TO ME IN A QUERULOUS TONE
THE MAN WHO HAD WISHED TO STOP THE AFFAIR RAN TO A CORNER OF THE ROOM AND THREW HIMSELF ON A SOFA WITH HIS FACE TO THE WALL PIERRE HID HIS FACE FROM WHICH A FAINT SMILE FORGOT TO FADE THOUGH HIS FEATURES NOW EXPRESSED HORROR AND FEAR ALL WERE STILL
LOCKED UP AND SEQUESTERED IN SOME DEEP RECESS WE MUST BE MADE SENSIBLE THAT THE WORLD OF ORDINARY LIFE IS SUDDENLY ARRESTED LAID ASLEEP TRANCED RACKED INTO A DREAD ARMISTICE TIME MUST BE ANNIHILATED
CARDS AND SUPPER WERE OVER BUT THE VISITORS HAD NOT YET DISPERSED PIERRE THREW OFF HIS CLOAK AND ENTERED THE FIRST ROOM IN WHICH WERE THE REMAINS OF SUPPER A FOOTMAN THINKING NO ONE SAW HIM
BUT IGNOBLE INSTINCT BY WHICH WE CLEAVE TO LIFE AN INSTINCT WHICH AS BEING INDISPENSABLE TO THE PRIMAL LAW OF SELF PRESERVATION
AND MADE APPREHENSIBLE BY REACTION NOW APPLY THIS TO THE CASE IN MACBETH HERE AS I HAVE SAID
OVER THE RHONE TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT BEAUCAIRE WE NEVER DID TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT BEAUCAIRE OF COURSE BEAUTIFUL BEAUCAIRE WITH THE HIGH TRIANGULAR WHITE TOWER THAT LOOKED AS THIN AS A NEEDLE AND AS TALL AS THE FLATIRON BETWEEN FIFTH AND BROADWAY
EMPTY HE THREW THE BOTTLE TO THE ENGLISHMAN WHO CAUGHT IT NEATLY DOLOKHOV JUMPED DOWN HE SMELT STRONGLY OF RUM WELL DONE FINE FELLOW THERE'S A BET FOR YOU DEVIL TAKE YOU CAME FROM DIFFERENT SIDES
DID ACTUALLY OCCUR WHICH THE GENIUS OF SHAKSPEARE HAS INVENTED AND ALL GOOD JUDGES AND THE MOST EMINENT DILETTANTI ACKNOWLEDGED THE FELICITY OF SHAKSPEARE'S SUGGESTION
DROPPED HIS HANDS TOOK THE BOTTLE AND LIFTED IT TO HIS LIPS THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND RAISED HIS FREE HAND TO BALANCE HIMSELF
FOR THE SAKE OF GRATIFYING HIS OWN ENORMOUS AND TEEMING FACULTY OF CREATION SHAKSPEARE HAS INTRODUCED TWO MURDERERS AND AS USUAL IN HIS HANDS THEY ARE REMARKABLY DISCRIMINATED
PIERRE TOOK HIS HANDS FROM HIS EYES DOLOKHOV STILL SAT IN THE SAME POSITION
AFTER WHICH THERE WAS GENERALLY A DRINKING BOUT FINISHING WITH VISITS OF A KIND PIERRE WAS VERY FOND OF
AND SO GUARDED AGAINST HIS HEART AND HAVING HIS NIECE WITH HIM HE WENT ROUND THE WORLD HE WASN'T OBTRUSIVE ABOUT HIS HEART YOU WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN HE HAD ONE HE ONLY LEFT IT TO THE PHYSICAL LABORATORY AT WATERBURY FOR THE BENEFIT OF SCIENCE
HE STOOPED AND POINTED TO THE SLOPING LEDGE OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AND WITHOUT HOLDING ON TO ANYTHING IS THAT RIGHT QUITE RIGHT SAID THE ENGLISHMAN ANATOLE TURNED TO THE ENGLISHMAN AND TAKING HIM BY ONE OF THE BUTTONS OF HIS COAT
THE LINES OF THAT MOUTH WERE REMARKABLY FINELY CURVED THE MIDDLE OF THE UPPER LIP FORMED A SHARP WEDGE AND CLOSED FIRMLY ON THE FIRM LOWER ONE
HIS HEAD AND ARM WAVERED STILL MORE WITH THE STRAIN ONE HAND MOVED AS IF TO CLUTCH THE WINDOW SILL BUT REFRAINED FROM TOUCHING IT PIERRE AGAIN COVERED HIS EYES AND THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER OPEN THEM AGAIN SUDDENLY HE WAS AWARE OF A STIR ALL AROUND HE LOOKED UP
THEN THE WORLD OF DARKNESS PASSES AWAY LIKE A PAGEANTRY IN THE CLOUDS THE KNOCKING AT THE GATE IS HEARD AND IT MAKES KNOWN AUDIBLY THAT THE REACTION HAS COMMENCED THE HUMAN HAS MADE ITS REFLUX UPON THE FIENDISH
IN ORDINARY CASES WHERE THE SYMPATHY IS WHOLLY DIRECTED TO THE CASE OF THE MURDERED PERSON IS AN INCIDENT OF COARSE AND VULGAR HORROR AND FOR THIS REASON THAT IT FLINGS THE INTEREST EXCLUSIVELY UPON THE NATURAL
THE ANIMAL'S ACTION ITS HIGH STEPPING ITS SKIN THAT WAS LIKE SATIN AND THE PEACE AND THE RED CHEEKS AND THE BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL OLD HOUSE JUST NEAR BRANSHAW TELERAGH IT WAS
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED SUDDENLY DOLOKHOV MADE A BACKWARD MOVEMENT WITH HIS SPINE AND HIS ARM TREMBLED NERVOUSLY THIS WAS SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE HIS WHOLE BODY TO SLIP AS HE SAT ON THE SLOPING LEDGE AS HE BEGAN SLIPPING DOWN
YET HOWEVER OBSTINATELY I ENDEAVORED WITH MY UNDERSTANDING TO COMPREHEND THIS FOR MANY YEARS I NEVER COULD SEE WHY IT SHOULD PRODUCE SUCH AN EFFECT HERE I PAUSE FOR ONE MOMENT TO EXHORT THE READER
WHY IT IS NEARLY AS BRIGHT AS IN PROVENCE AND THEN WE SHALL COME BACK TO THE FIRESIDE WITH JUST THE TOUCH OF A SIGH BECAUSE WE ARE NOT IN THAT PROVENCE WHERE EVEN THE SADDEST STORIES ARE GAY CONSIDER THE LAMENTABLE HISTORY OF PEIRE VIDAL
EMOTIONS WERE REALLY STIRRED HER LITTLE HEART MIGHT CEASE TO BEAT FOR TWELVE YEARS I HAD TO WATCH EVERY WORD THAT ANY PERSON UTTERED IN ANY CONVERSATION AND I HAD TO HEAD IT OFF WHAT THE ENGLISH CALL THINGS OFF LOVE POVERTY CRIME
FLORENCE'S AUNTS USED TO SAY THAT I MUST BE THE LAZIEST MAN IN PHILADELPHIA THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TO PHILADELPHIA AND THEY HAD THE NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE YOU SEE THE FIRST THING THEY SAID TO ME WHEN I CALLED IN ON FLORENCE IN THE LITTLE ANCIENT COLONIAL WOODEN HOUSE
LAS TOURS OF THE FOUR CASTLES HAD
AND THE HAND HOLDING THE BOTTLE WAS LIFTED HIGHER AND HIGHER AND TREMBLED WITH THE EFFORT THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTYING PERCEPTIBLY AND RISING STILL HIGHER AND HIS HEAD TILTING YET FURTHER BACK WHY IS IT SO LONG THOUGHT PIERRE
WAS DRINKING ON THE SLY WHAT WAS LEFT IN THE GLASSES FROM THE THIRD ROOM CAME SOUNDS OF LAUGHTER THE SHOUTING OF FAMILIAR VOICES THE GROWLING OF A BEAR AND GENERAL COMMOTION
I GUESS FLORENCE WANTED TO RAISE THE CULTURE OF THE STUYVESANT CROWD AND DID IT AS SHE MIGHT HAVE GONE IN SLUMMING INTELLECTUAL SLUMMING THAT WAS WHAT IT WAS SHE ALWAYS WANTED TO LEAVE THE WORLD A LITTLE MORE ELEVATED THAN SHE FOUND IT POOR DEAR THING
SHE WAS YET A GRADUATE OF POUGHKEEPSIE I NEVER COULD IMAGINE HOW SHE DID IT THE QUEER CHATTERY PERSON THAT SHE WAS WITH THE FAR AWAY LOOK IN HER EYES WHICH WASN'T HOWEVER IN THE LEAST ROMANTIC
BUT THOUGH IN MACBETH THE STRIFE OF MIND IS GREATER THAN IN HIS WIFE THE TIGER SPIRIT NOT SO AWAKE AND HIS FEELINGS CAUGHT CHIEFLY BY CONTAGION FROM HER
ANATOLE STOPPED HIM DON'T TOUCH HIM YOU'LL STARTLE HIM AND THEN HE'LL BE KILLED EH WHAT THEN EH
IN FACT MY UNDERSTANDING SAID POSITIVELY THAT IT COULD NOT PRODUCE ANY EFFECT BUT I KNEW BETTER I FELT THAT IT DID AND I WAITED AND CLUNG TO THE PROBLEM UNTIL FURTHER KNOWLEDGE SHOULD ENABLE ME TO SOLVE IT
AND I SHALL GO ON TALKING IN A LOW VOICE WHILE THE SEA SOUNDS IN THE DISTANCE AND OVERHEAD THE GREAT BLACK FLOOD OF WIND POLISHES THE BRIGHT STARS FROM TIME TO TIME WE SHALL GET UP AND GO TO THE DOOR AND LOOK OUT AT THE GREAT MOON AND SAY
AND HALF A DOZEN FOLDING CHAIRS IN A SPECIAL CASE THAT HE ALWAYS KEPT IN HIS CABIN THERE MUST HAVE BEEN HALF A CARGO OF FRUIT FOR TO EVERY PERSON ON BOARD THE SEVERAL STEAMERS THAT THEY EMPLOYED TO EVERY PERSON WITH WHOM HE HAD SO MUCH AS A NODDING ACQUAINTANCE
AND MADE PALPABLE IN ORDER THAT A NEW WORLD MAY STEP IN THIS WORLD MUST FOR A TIME DISAPPEAR THE MURDERERS AND THE MURDER MUST BE INSULATED
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT WAIT A BIT HE IS NOT DRUNK YET A BOTTLE HERE SAID ANATOLE TAKING A GLASS FROM THE TABLE HE WENT UP TO PIERRE FIRST OF ALL YOU MUST DRINK PIERRE DRANK ONE GLASS AFTER ANOTHER
SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS AND SO EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED FOR HER AGE HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE IS EXQUISITE IT IS AMAZING TO ME SAID BINGLEY HOW YOUNG LADIES CAN HAVE PATIENCE TO BE SO VERY ACCOMPLISHED AS THEY ALL ARE
I WOULD RATHER BE PAID THE COMPLIMENT OF BEING BELIEVED SINCERE I THANK YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR THE HONOUR YOU HAVE DONE ME IN YOUR PROPOSALS BUT TO ACCEPT THEM IS ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE MY FEELINGS IN EVERY RESPECT FORBID IT CAN I SPEAK PLAINER
IS THIS A HINT TO ME LIZZY SAID HER FATHER TO SEND FOR THE HORSES NO INDEED I DO NOT WISH TO AVOID THE WALK THE DISTANCE IS NOTHING WHEN ONE HAS A MOTIVE ONLY THREE MILES I SHALL BE BACK BY DINNER
AND JANE WHO HAD ONLY BEEN WITHHELD BY THE FEAR OF GIVING ALARM OR INCONVENIENCE FROM EXPRESSING IN HER NOTE HOW MUCH SHE LONGED FOR SUCH A VISIT WAS DELIGHTED AT HER ENTRANCE SHE WAS NOT EQUAL HOWEVER TO MUCH CONVERSATION
ELIZABETH WOULD NOT OPPOSE SUCH AN INJUNCTION AND A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION MAKING HER ALSO SENSIBLE THAT IT WOULD BE WISEST TO GET IT OVER AS SOON AND AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND TRIED TO CONCEAL
THAT I HAVE YOUR RESPECTED MOTHER'S PERMISSION FOR THIS ADDRESS YOU CAN HARDLY DOUBT THE PURPORT OF MY DISCOURSE HOWEVER YOUR NATURAL DELICACY MAY LEAD YOU TO DISSEMBLE MY ATTENTIONS HAVE BEEN TOO MARKED TO BE MISTAKEN
AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN WHEN I HAVE THE HONOUR OF SEEING HER AGAIN I SHALL SPEAK IN THE VERY HIGHEST TERMS OF YOUR MODESTY ECONOMY AND OTHER AMIABLE QUALIFICATION INDEED MISTER COLLINS ALL PRAISE OF ME WILL BE UNNECESSARY YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO JUDGE FOR MYSELF
SHE SEES THEM NOW VERY OFTEN STANDING IN CLARKE'S LIBRARY MISSUS BENNET WAS PREVENTED REPLYING BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE FOOTMAN WITH A NOTE FOR MISS BENNET IT CAME FROM NETHERFIELD AND THE SERVANT WAITED FOR AN ANSWER MISSUS BENNET'S EYES SPARKLED WITH PLEASURE
AND THEN WALKED TOWARDS THE TABLE WHERE A FEW BOOKS WERE LYING HE IMMEDIATELY OFFERED TO FETCH HER OTHERS ALL THAT HIS LIBRARY AFFORDED AND I WISH MY COLLECTION WERE LARGER FOR YOUR BENEFIT AND MY OWN CREDIT BUT I AM AN IDLE FELLOW AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT MANY I HAVE MORE THAN I EVER LOOKED INTO
AND ELIZABETH BEGAN TO LIKE THEM HERSELF WHEN SHE SAW HOW MUCH AFFECTION AND SOLICITUDE THEY SHOWED FOR JANE THE APOTHECARY CAME AND HAVING EXAMINED HIS PATIENT SAID AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED THAT SHE HAD CAUGHT A VIOLENT COLD
ALL THIS SHE MUST POSSESS ADDED DARCY AND TO ALL THIS SHE MUST YET ADD SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND BY EXTENSIVE READING I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED AT YOUR KNOWING ONLY SIX ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN
MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE I DESERVE NEITHER SUCH PRAISE NOR SUCH CENSURE CRIED ELIZABETH
AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER WHO LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR CHEAPSIDE THAT IS CAPITAL ADDED HER SISTER AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY IF THEY HAD UNCLES ENOUGH TO FILL ALL CHEAPSIDE CRIED BINGLEY IT WOULD NOT MAKE THEM ONE JOT LESS AGREEABLE
YES BUT AS IT HAPPENS THEY ARE ALL OF THEM VERY CLEVER THIS IS THE ONLY POINT I FLATTER MYSELF ON WHICH WE DO NOT AGREE I HAD HOPED THAT OUR SENTIMENTS COINCIDED IN EVERY PARTICULAR BUT I MUST SO FAR DIFFER FROM YOU
WHO WERE USUALLY TEMPTED THITHER THREE OR FOUR TIMES A WEEK TO PAY THEIR DUTY TO THEIR AUNT AND TO A MILLINER'S SHOP JUST OVER THE WAY THE TWO YOUNGEST OF THE FAMILY CATHERINE AND LYDIA WERE PARTICULARLY FREQUENT IN THESE ATTENTIONS THEIR MINDS WERE MORE VACANT THAN THEIR SISTERS
BY INCESSANT EMPLOYMENT THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN DISTRESS AND DIVERSION MISSUS BENNET AND KITTY WALKED OFF AND AS SOON AS THEY WERE GONE MISTER COLLINS BEGAN BELIEVE ME MY DEAR MISS ELIZABETH
SHE WILL BE TAKEN GOOD CARE OF AS LONG AS SHE STAYS THERE IT IS ALL VERY WELL I WOULD GO AND SEE HER IF I COULD HAVE THE CARRIAGE ELIZABETH FEELING REALLY ANXIOUS WAS DETERMINED TO GO TO HER THOUGH THE CARRIAGE WAS NOT TO BE HAD AND AS SHE WAS NO HORSEWOMAN
I ADMIRE THE ACTIVITY OF YOUR BENEVOLENCE OBSERVED MARY BUT EVERY IMPULSE OF FEELING SHOULD BE GUIDED BY REASON AND IN MY OPINION EXERTION SHOULD ALWAYS BE IN PROPORTION TO WHAT IS REQUIRED WE WILL GO AS FAR AS MERYTON WITH YOU
ELIZABETH DID NOT QUIT HER ROOM FOR A MOMENT NOR WERE THE OTHER LADIES OFTEN ABSENT THE GENTLEMEN BEING OUT THEY HAD IN FACT NOTHING TO DO ELSEWHERE WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK THREE ELIZABETH FELT THAT SHE MUST GO AND VERY UNWILLINGLY SAID SO
THIS HAS BEEN MY MOTIVE MY FAIR COUSIN AND I FLATTER MYSELF IT WILL NOT SINK ME IN YOUR ESTEEM AND NOW NOTHING REMAINS FOR ME BUT TO ASSURE YOU IN THE MOST ANIMATED LANGUAGE OF THE VIOLENCE OF MY AFFECTION TO FORTUNE I AM PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT
AND HAVING NO FEELINGS OF DIFFIDENCE TO MAKE IT DISTRESSING TO HIMSELF EVEN AT THE MOMENT HE SET ABOUT IT IN A VERY ORDERLY MANNER WITH ALL THE OBSERVANCES WHICH HE SUPPOSED A REGULAR PART OF THE BUSINESS ON FINDING MISSUS BENNET ELIZABETH
WHEN I DO MYSELF THE HONOUR OF SPEAKING TO YOU NEXT ON THE SUBJECT I SHALL HOPE TO RECEIVE A MORE FAVOURABLE ANSWER THAN YOU HAVE NOW GIVEN ME THOUGH I AM FAR FROM ACCUSING YOU OF CRUELTY AT PRESENT
WALKING WAS HER ONLY ALTERNATIVE SHE DECLARED HER RESOLUTION HOW CAN YOU BE SO SILLY CRIED HER MOTHER AS TO THINK OF SUCH A THING IN ALL THIS DIRT YOU WILL NOT BE FIT TO BE SEEN WHEN YOU GET THERE I SHALL BE VERY FIT TO SEE JANE WHICH IS ALL I WANT
I CANNOT BOAST OF KNOWING MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE THAT ARE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED NOR I I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY THEN OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN
VERY UNWELL THIS MORNING WHICH I SUPPOSE IS TO BE IMPUTED TO MY GETTING WET THROUGH YESTERDAY MY KIND FRIENDS WILL NOT HEAR OF MY RETURNING TILL I AM BETTER THEY INSIST ALSO ON MY SEEING MISTER JONES
ELIZABETH ASSURED HIM THAT SHE COULD SUIT HERSELF PERFECTLY WITH THOSE IN THE ROOM I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY
AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT MISTER JONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR EARLY IN THE MORNING IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
AND WHERE HER APPEARANCE CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF SURPRISE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE WALKED THREE MILES SO EARLY IN THE DAY IN SUCH DIRTY WEATHER AND BY HERSELF WAS ALMOST INCREDIBLE TO MISSUS HURST AND MISS BINGLEY
COME AS SOON AS YOU CAN ON RECEIPT OF THIS MY BROTHER AND THE GENTLEMEN ARE TO DINE WITH THE OFFICERS YOURS EVER CAROLINE BINGLEY WITH THE OFFICERS CRIED LYDIA I WONDER MY AUNT DID NOT TELL US OF THAT
IF WHAT I HAVE HITHERTO SAID CAN APPEAR TO YOU IN THE FORM OF ENCOURAGEMENT I KNOW NOT HOW TO EXPRESS MY REFUSAL IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CONVINCE YOU OF ITS BEING ONE YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO FLATTER MYSELF MY DEAR COUSIN THAT YOUR REFUSAL OF MY ADDRESSES IS MERELY WORDS OF COURSE
THAT I DO NOT RECKON THE NOTICE AND KINDNESS OF LADY CATHERINE DE BOURGH AS AMONG THE LEAST OF THE ADVANTAGES IN MY POWER TO OFFER YOU WILL FIND HER MANNERS BEYOND ANYTHING I CAN DESCRIBE AND YOUR WIT AND VIVACITY I THINK MUST BE ACCEPTABLE TO HER
ELIZABETH BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON HER IS ONE OF THOSE YOUNG LADIES WHO SEEK TO RECOMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE OTHER SEX BY UNDERVALUING THEIR OWN AND WITH MANY MEN I DARE SAY IT SUCCEEDS
AND MAKING HER SISTER THE EXCUSE SAID SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE COULD STAY BELOW WITH A BOOK MISTER HURST LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU PREFER READING TO CARDS SAID HE THAT IS RATHER SINGULAR
BUT ABLE TO MAKE A SMALL INCOME GO A GOOD WAY THIS IS MY ADVICE FIND SUCH A WOMAN AS SOON AS YOU CAN BRING HER TO HUNSFORD AND I WILL VISIT HER ALLOW ME BY THE WAY TO OBSERVE MY FAIR COUSIN
ON THIS SUBJECT AND IT WAS BUT THE VERY SATURDAY NIGHT BEFORE I LEFT HUNSFORD BETWEEN OUR POOLS AT QUADRILLE WHILE MISSUS JENKINSON WAS ARRANGING MISS DE BOURGH'S FOOTSTOOL THAT SHE SAID MISTER COLLINS YOU MUST MARRY
WERE YOUR FRIEND LADY CATHERINE TO KNOW ME I AM PERSUADED SHE WOULD FIND ME IN EVERY RESPECT ILL QUALIFIED FOR THE SITUATION WERE IT CERTAIN THAT LADY CATHERINE WOULD THINK SO SAID MISTER COLLINS VERY GRAVELY
AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE
MISTER BENNET'S PROPERTY CONSISTED ALMOST ENTIRELY IN AN ESTATE OF TWO THOUSAND A YEAR WHICH UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIS DAUGHTERS WAS ENTAILED IN DEFAULT OF HEIRS MALE ON A DISTANT RELATION AND THEIR MOTHER'S FORTUNE
DINING OUT SAID MISSUS BENNET THAT IS VERY UNLUCKY CAN I HAVE THE CARRIAGE SAID JANE NO MY DEAR YOU HAD BETTER GO ON HORSEBACK BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKELY TO RAIN AND THEN YOU MUST STAY ALL NIGHT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD SCHEME SAID ELIZABETH
IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS AND THEN YOU HAVE ADDED SO MUCH TO IT YOURSELF YOU ARE ALWAYS BUYING BOOKS I CANNOT COMPREHEND THE NEGLECT OF A FAMILY LIBRARY IN SUCH DAYS AS THESE
AND SHE WAS EAGERLY CALLING OUT WHILE HER DAUGHTER READ WELL JANE WHO IS IT FROM WHAT IS IT ABOUT WHAT DOES HE SAY WELL JANE MAKE HASTE AND TELL US MAKE HASTE MY LOVE IT IS FROM MISS BINGLEY SAID JANE AND THEN READ IT ALOUD
I SHALL CHOOSE TO ATTRIBUTE IT TO YOUR WISH OF INCREASING MY LOVE BY SUSPENSE ACCORDING TO THE USUAL PRACTICE OF ELEGANT FEMALES I DO ASSURE YOU SIR THAT I HAVE NO PRETENSIONS WHATEVER TO THAT KIND OF ELEGANCE WHICH CONSISTS IN TORMENTING A RESPECTABLE MAN
AND WHEN MISS BINGLEY LEFT THEM TOGETHER COULD ATTEMPT LITTLE BESIDES EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY KINDNESS SHE WAS TREATED WITH ELIZABETH SILENTLY ATTENDED HER WHEN BREAKFAST WAS OVER THEY WERE JOINED BY THE SISTERS
YOU ARE TOO HASTY SIR SHE CRIED YOU FORGET THAT I HAVE MADE NO ANSWER LET ME DO IT WITHOUT FURTHER LOSS OF TIME ACCEPT MY THANKS FOR THE COMPLIMENT YOU ARE PAYING ME I AM VERY SENSIBLE OF THE HONOUR OF YOUR PROPOSALS
WHEN SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF SEEING HER SLEEP AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HER RATHER RIGHT THAN PLEASANT THAT SHE SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS HERSELF ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM SHE FOUND THE WHOLE PARTY AT LOO AND WAS IMMEDIATELY INVITED TO JOIN THEM BUT SUSPECTING THEM TO BE PLAYING HIGH SHE DECLINED IT
WHO ARE SO DARING AS TO RISK THEIR HAPPINESS ON THE CHANCE OF BEING ASKED A SECOND TIME I AM PERFECTLY SERIOUS IN MY REFUSAL YOU COULD NOT MAKE ME HAPPY AND I AM CONVINCED THAT I AM THE LAST WOMAN IN THE WORLD WHO COULD MAKE YOU SO NAY
AND PAY ME THE COMPLIMENT OF BELIEVING WHAT I SAY I WISH YOU VERY HAPPY AND VERY RICH AND BY REFUSING YOUR HAND DO ALL IN MY POWER TO PREVENT YOUR BEING OTHERWISE IN MAKING ME THE OFFER YOU MUST HAVE SATISFIED THE DELICACY OF YOUR FEELINGS WITH REGARD TO MY FAMILY
OF THE MOST INTERESTING INTELLIGENCE EVERY DAY ADDED SOMETHING TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE OFFICERS NAMES AND CONNECTIONS THEIR LODGINGS WERE NOT LONG A SECRET AND AT LENGTH THEY BEGAN TO KNOW THE OFFICERS THEMSELVES MISTER PHILLIPS VISITED THEM ALL
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE FOR ME TO STATE MY REASONS FOR MARRYING AND MOREOVER FOR COMING INTO HERTFORDSHIRE WITH THE DESIGN OF SELECTING A WIFE AS I CERTAINLY DID THE IDEA OF MISTER COLLINS WITH ALL HIS SOLEMN COMPOSURE
LIKE MYSELF TO SET THE EXAMPLE OF MATRIMONY IN HIS PARISH SECONDLY THAT I AM CONVINCED THAT IT WILL ADD VERY GREATLY TO MY HAPPINESS AND THIRDLY WHICH PERHAPS I OUGHT TO HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER
AND IMMEDIATELY AND IN SILENCE WITHDREW DETERMINED IF HE PERSISTED IN CONSIDERING HER REPEATED REFUSALS AS FLATTERING ENCOURAGEMENT TO APPLY TO HER FATHER WHOSE NEGATIVE MIGHT BE UTTERED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO BE DECISIVE
THEY ARE WANTED IN THE FARM MISTER BENNET ARE THEY NOT THEY ARE WANTED IN THE FARM MUCH OFTENER THAN I CAN GET THEM BUT IF YOU HAVE GOT THEM TO DAY SAID ELIZABETH MY MOTHER'S PURPOSE WILL BE ANSWERED
AND MAY TAKE POSSESSION OF LONGBOURN ESTATE WHENEVER IT FALLS WITHOUT ANY SELF REPROACH THIS MATTER MAY BE CONSIDERED THEREFORE AS FINALLY SETTLED AND RISING AS SHE THUS SPOKE SHE WOULD HAVE QUITTED THE ROOM HAD MISTER COLLINS NOT THUS ADDRESSED HER
AND ONE OF THE YOUNGER GIRLS TOGETHER SOON AFTER BREAKFAST HE ADDRESSED THE MOTHER IN THESE WORDS MAY I HOPE MADAM FOR YOUR INTEREST WITH YOUR FAIR DAUGHTER ELIZABETH WHEN I SOLICIT FOR THE HONOUR OF A PRIVATE AUDIENCE WITH HER IN THE COURSE OF THIS MORNING
MY REASONS FOR BELIEVING IT ARE BRIEFLY THESE IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME THAT MY HAND IS UNWORTHY YOUR ACCEPTANCE OR THAT THE ESTABLISHMENT I CAN OFFER WOULD BE ANY OTHER THAN HIGHLY DESIRABLE
ON THAT HEAD THEREFORE I SHALL BE UNIFORMLY SILENT AND YOU MAY ASSURE YOURSELF THAT NO UNGENEROUS REPROACH SHALL EVER PASS MY LIPS WHEN WE ARE MARRIED IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO INTERRUPT HIM NOW
BEFORE ELIZABETH HAD TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT A BLUSH OF SURPRISE MISSUS BENNET ANSWERED INSTANTLY OH DEAR YES CERTAINLY I AM SURE LIZZY WILL BE VERY HAPPY I AM SURE SHE CAN HAVE NO OBJECTION COME KITTY
DO NOT CONSIDER ME NOW AS AN ELEGANT FEMALE INTENDING TO PLAGUE YOU BUT AS A RATIONAL CREATURE SPEAKING THE TRUTH FROM HER HEART YOU ARE UNIFORMLY CHARMING CRIED HE WITH AN AIR OF AWKWARD GALLANTRY
WHOM THEY SECRETLY MEAN TO ACCEPT WHEN HE FIRST APPLIES FOR THEIR FAVOUR AND THAT SOMETIMES THE REFUSAL IS REPEATED A SECOND OR EVEN A THIRD TIME I AM THEREFORE BY NO MEANS DISCOURAGED BY WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID
SHE HAS NOTHING IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND HER BUT BEING AN EXCELLENT WALKER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER APPEARANCE THIS MORNING SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA I COULD HARDLY KEEP MY COUNTENANCE
SAID CATHERINE AND LYDIA ELIZABETH ACCEPTED THEIR COMPANY AND THE THREE YOUNG LADIES SET OFF TOGETHER IF WE MAKE HASTE SAID LYDIA AS THEY WALKED ALONG PERHAPS WE MAY SEE SOMETHING OF CAPTAIN CARTER BEFORE HE GOES IN MERYTON THEY PARTED
THEY COULD TALK OF NOTHING BUT OFFICERS AND MISTER BINGLEY'S LARGE FORTUNE THE MENTION OF WHICH GAVE ANIMATION TO THEIR MOTHER WAS WORTHLESS IN THEIR EYES WHEN OPPOSED TO THE REGIMENTALS OF AN ENSIGN AFTER LISTENING ONE MORNING TO THEIR EFFUSIONS ON THIS SUBJECT
THEIR BROTHER INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHOM SHE COULD REGARD WITH ANY COMPLACENCY HIS ANXIETY FOR JANE WAS EVIDENT
WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU THERE ARE MANY AMIABLE YOUNG WOMEN BUT THE FACT IS THAT BEING AS I AM TO INHERIT THIS ESTATE AFTER THE DEATH OF YOUR HONOURED FATHER WHO HOWEVER MAY LIVE MANY YEARS LONGER
AND SHALL HOPE TO LEAD YOU TO THE ALTAR ERE LONG UPON MY WORD SIR CRIED ELIZABETH YOUR HOPE IS A RATHER EXTRAORDINARY ONE AFTER MY DECLARATION I DO ASSURE YOU THAT I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE YOUNG LADIES IF SUCH YOUNG LADIES THERE ARE
AND GATHERING HER WORK TOGETHER SHE WAS HASTENING AWAY WHEN ELIZABETH CALLED OUT DEAR MADAM DO NOT GO I BEG YOU WILL NOT GO MISTER COLLINS MUST EXCUSE ME HE CAN HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO ME THAT ANYBODY NEED NOT HEAR I AM GOING AWAY MYSELF
WITH A RENEWAL OF TENDERNESS HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO HER ROOM ON LEAVING THE DINING PARLOUR AND SAT WITH HER TILL SUMMONED TO COFFEE SHE WAS STILL VERY POORLY AND ELIZABETH WOULD NOT QUIT HER AT ALL TILL LATE IN THE EVENING
HER INQUIRIES AFTER HER SISTER WERE NOT VERY FAVOURABLY ANSWERED MISS BENNET HAD SLEPT ILL AND THOUGH UP WAS VERY FEVERISH AND NOT WELL ENOUGH TO LEAVE HER ROOM ELIZABETH WAS GLAD TO BE TAKEN TO HER IMMEDIATELY
BUT IT MUST VERY MATERIALLY LESSEN THEIR CHANCE OF MARRYING MEN OF ANY CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD REPLIED DARCY TO THIS SPEECH BINGLEY MADE NO ANSWER BUT HIS SISTERS GAVE IT THEIR HEARTY ASSENT AND INDULGED THEIR MIRTH FOR SOME TIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR DEAR FRIEND'S VULGAR RELATIONS
BUT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO OTHERWISE THAN TO DECLINE THEM I AM NOT NOW TO LEARN REPLIED MISTER COLLINS WITH A FORMAL WAVE OF THE HAND THAT IT IS USUAL WITH YOUNG LADIES TO REJECT THE ADDRESSES OF THE MAN
YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT OH CERTAINLY CRIED HIS FAITHFUL ASSISTANT NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING
WHILE HIS SISTERS CONVINCED THAT NO COUNTRY ADVICE COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE RECOMMENDED AN EXPRESS TO TOWN FOR ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PHYSICIANS THIS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH THEIR BROTHER'S PROPOSAL
I THOUGHT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET LOOKED REMARKABLY WELL WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM THIS MORNING HER DIRTY PETTICOAT QUITE ESCAPED MY NOTICE YOU OBSERVED IT MISTER DARCY I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY AND I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO SEE YOUR SISTER MAKE SUCH AN EXHIBITION
ALMOST AS SOON AS I ENTERED THE HOUSE I SINGLED YOU OUT AS THE COMPANION OF MY FUTURE LIFE
THE NEXT DAY OPENED A NEW SCENE AT LONGBOURN MISTER COLLINS MADE HIS DECLARATION IN FORM HAVING RESOLVED TO DO IT WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME AS HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE EXTENDED ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY
SINCE I AM WELL AWARE THAT IT COULD NOT BE COMPLIED WITH AND THAT ONE THOUSAND POUNDS IN THE FOUR PER CENTS WHICH WILL NOT BE YOURS TILL AFTER YOUR MOTHER'S DECEASE IS ALL THAT YOU MAY EVER BE ENTITLED TO
AND I AM PERSUADED THAT WHEN SANCTIONED BY THE EXPRESS AUTHORITY OF BOTH YOUR EXCELLENT PARENTS MY PROPOSALS WILL NOT FAIL OF BEING ACCEPTABLE TO SUCH PERSEVERANCE IN WILFUL SELF DECEPTION ELIZABETH WOULD MAKE NO REPLY
CERTAINLY NOT TO WALK THREE MILES OR FOUR MILES OR FIVE MILES OR WHATEVER IT IS ABOVE HER ANKLES IN DIRT AND ALONE QUITE ALONE WHAT COULD SHE MEAN BY IT IT SEEMS TO ME TO SHOW AN ABOMINABLE SORT OF CONCEITED INDEPENDENCE
MY CONNECTIONS WITH THE FAMILY OF DE BOURGH AND MY RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR OWN ARE CIRCUMSTANCES HIGHLY IN MY FAVOUR AND YOU SHOULD TAKE IT INTO FURTHER CONSIDERATION THAT IN SPITE OF YOUR MANIFOLD ATTRACTIONS
SHE IS REALLY A VERY SWEET GIRL AND I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART SHE WERE WELL SETTLED BUT WITH SUCH A FATHER AND MOTHER AND SUCH LOW CONNECTIONS I AM AFRAID THERE IS NO CHANCE OF IT I THINK I HAVE HEARD YOU SAY THAT THEIR UNCLE IS AN ATTORNEY IN MERYTON YES
AS IF THE CREDIT OF MAKING IT RAIN WERE ALL HER OWN TILL THE NEXT MORNING HOWEVER SHE WAS NOT AWARE OF ALL THE FELICITY OF HER CONTRIVANCE BREAKFAST WAS SCARCELY OVER WHEN A SERVANT FROM NETHERFIELD BROUGHT THE FOLLOWING NOTE FOR ELIZABETH MY DEAREST LIZZY I FIND MYSELF
I RATHER WONDER NOW AT YOUR KNOWING ANY ARE YOU SO SEVERE UPON YOUR OWN SEX AS TO DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THIS I NEVER SAW SUCH A WOMAN I NEVER SAW SUCH CAPACITY AND TASTE AND APPLICATION AND ELEGANCE AS YOU DESCRIBE UNITED
AND ELIZABETH WAS CONVINCED THAT THEY HELD HER IN CONTEMPT FOR IT SHE WAS RECEIVED HOWEVER VERY POLITELY BY THEM AND IN THEIR BROTHER'S MANNERS THERE WAS SOMETHING BETTER THAN POLITENESS THERE WAS GOOD HUMOUR AND KINDNESS MISTER DARCY SAID VERY LITTLE
AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM HER MANNERS WERE PRONOUNCED TO BE VERY BAD INDEED A MIXTURE OF PRIDE AND IMPERTINENCE SHE HAD NO CONVERSATION NO STYLE NO BEAUTY MISSUS HURST THOUGHT THE SAME AND ADDED
I AM NOT A GREAT READER AND I HAVE PLEASURE IN MANY THINGS IN NURSING YOUR SISTER I AM SURE YOU HAVE PLEASURE SAID BINGLEY AND I HOPE IT WILL BE SOON INCREASED BY SEEING HER QUITE WELL ELIZABETH THANKED HIM FROM HER HEART
IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT ANOTHER OFFER OF MARRIAGE MAY EVER BE MADE YOU YOUR PORTION IS UNHAPPILY SO SMALL THAT IT WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD UNDO THE EFFECTS OF YOUR LOVELINESS AND AMIABLE QUALIFICATIONS
THAT IT IS THE PARTICULAR ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE VERY NOBLE LADY WHOM I HAVE THE HONOUR OF CALLING PATRONESS TWICE HAS SHE CONDESCENDED TO GIVE ME HER OPINION
ESPECIALLY WHEN TEMPERED WITH THE SILENCE AND RESPECT WHICH HER RANK WILL INEVITABLY EXCITE THUS MUCH FOR MY GENERAL INTENTION IN FAVOUR OF MATRIMONY IT REMAINS TO BE TOLD WHY MY VIEWS WERE DIRECTED TOWARDS LONGBOURN INSTEAD OF MY OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
A MOST COUNTRY TOWN INDIFFERENCE TO DECORUM IT SHOWS AN AFFECTION FOR HER SISTER THAT IS VERY PLEASING SAID BINGLEY I AM AFRAID MISTER DARCY OBSERVED MISS BINGLEY IN A HALF WHISPER
AND FINDING HERSELF AT LAST WITHIN VIEW OF THE HOUSE WITH WEARY ANKLES DIRTY STOCKINGS AND A FACE GLOWING WITH THE WARMTH OF EXERCISE SHE WAS SHOWN INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR WHERE ALL BUT JANE WERE ASSEMBLED
ON THE FIRST APPLICATION AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE EVEN NOW SAID AS MUCH TO ENCOURAGE MY SUIT AS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TRUE DELICACY OF THE FEMALE CHARACTER REALLY MISTER COLLINS CRIED ELIZABETH WITH SOME WARMTH YOU PUZZLE ME EXCEEDINGLY
THAT YOU SHOULD BE SO READY TO THINK YOUR OWN CHILDREN SILLY IF I WISHED TO THINK SLIGHTINGLY OF ANYBODY'S CHILDREN IT SHOULD NOT BE OF MY OWN HOWEVER IF MY CHILDREN ARE SILLY I MUST HOPE TO BE ALWAYS SENSIBLE OF IT
BUT LYDIA WITH PERFECT INDIFFERENCE CONTINUED TO EXPRESS HER ADMIRATION OF CAPTAIN CARTER AND HER HOPE OF SEEING HIM IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AS HE WAS GOING THE NEXT MORNING TO LONDON I AM ASTONISHED MY DEAR SAID MISSUS BENNET
THEREFORE DO NOT BE ALARMED IF YOU SHOULD HEAR OF HIS HAVING BEEN TO ME AND EXCEPTING A SORE THROAT AND HEADACHE THERE IS NOT MUCH THE MATTER WITH ME YOURS ET CETERA WELL MY DEAR SAID MISTER BENNET WHEN ELIZABETH HAD READ THE NOTE ALOUD
THEY WERE WELL SUPPLIED BOTH WITH NEWS AND HAPPINESS BY THE RECENT ARRIVAL OF A MILITIA REGIMENT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS TO REMAIN THE WHOLE WINTER AND MERYTON WAS THE HEADQUARTERS THEIR VISITS TO MISSUS PHILLIPS WERE NOW PRODUCTIVE
IF YOUR DAUGHTER SHOULD HAVE A DANGEROUS FIT OF ILLNESS IF SHE SHOULD DIE IT WOULD BE A COMFORT TO KNOW THAT IT WAS ALL IN PURSUIT OF MISTER BINGLEY AND UNDER YOUR ORDERS OH I AM NOT AFRAID OF HER DYING PEOPLE DO NOT DIE OF LITTLE TRIFLING COLDS
AND THAT THEY MUST ENDEAVOUR TO GET THE BETTER OF IT ADVISED HER TO RETURN TO BED AND PROMISED HER SOME DRAUGHTS THE ADVICE WAS FOLLOWED READILY FOR THE FEVERISH SYMPTOMS INCREASED AND HER HEAD ACHED ACUTELY
THOUGH AMPLE FOR HER SITUATION IN LIFE COULD BUT ILL SUPPLY THE DEFICIENCY OF HIS HER FATHER HAD BEEN AN ATTORNEY IN MERYTON AND HAD LEFT HER FOUR THOUSAND POUNDS SHE HAD A SISTER MARRIED TO A MISTER PHILLIPS
BY WHOM ELIZABETH SAT HE WAS AN INDOLENT MAN WHO LIVED ONLY TO EAT DRINK AND PLAY AT CARDS WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER WHEN DINNER WAS OVER SHE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO JANE
I REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN I LIKED A RED COAT MYSELF VERY WELL AND INDEED SO I DO STILL AT MY HEART AND IF A SMART YOUNG COLONEL WITH FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND A YEAR SHOULD WANT ONE OF MY GIRLS I SHALL NOT SAY NAY TO HIM
SHE DID AT LAST EXTORT FROM HER FATHER AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE HORSES WERE ENGAGED JANE WAS THEREFORE OBLIGED TO GO ON HORSEBACK AND HER MOTHER ATTENDED HER TO THE DOOR WITH MANY CHEERFUL PROGNOSTICS OF A BAD DAY HER HOPES WERE ANSWERED
NO NO NONSENSE LIZZY I DESIRE YOU TO STAY WHERE YOU ARE AND UPON ELIZABETH'S SEEMING REALLY WITH VEXED AND EMBARRASSED LOOKS ABOUT TO ESCAPE SHE ADDED LIZZY I INSIST UPON YOUR STAYING AND HEARING MISTER COLLINS
VERY NONSENSICAL TO COME AT ALL WHY MUST SHE BE SCAMPERING ABOUT THE COUNTRY BECAUSE HER SISTER HAD A COLD HER HAIR SO UNTIDY SO BLOWSY YES AND HER PETTICOAT I HOPE YOU SAW HER PETTICOAT SIX INCHES DEEP IN MUD I AM
AND I THOUGHT COLONEL FORSTER LOOKED VERY BECOMING THE OTHER NIGHT AT SIR WILLIAM'S IN HIS REGIMENTALS MAMMA CRIED LYDIA MY AUNT SAYS THAT COLONEL FORSTER AND CAPTAIN CARTER DO NOT GO SO OFTEN TO MISS WATSON'S AS THEY DID WHEN THEY FIRST CAME
NEGLECT I AM SURE YOU NEGLECT NOTHING THAT CAN ADD TO THE BEAUTIES OF THAT NOBLE PLACE CHARLES WHEN YOU BUILD YOUR HOUSE I WISH IT MAY BE HALF AS DELIGHTFUL AS PEMBERLEY I WISH IT MAY
NO MAN WHO HAS FOR FORTY YEARS LIVED THE LIFE I HAVE CAN WITH IMPUNITY GO COOP HIMSELF IN THIS PRIM ENGLISH COUNTRY WITH ITS TRIM HEDGEROWS AND CULTIVATED FIELDS
AS FOR THE NOTE I HAD SENT HIM BY JIM THAT WORTHY LOST IT AND HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT TILL TO DAY BUT ACTING UPON INFORMATION HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE NATIVES HE HEADED NOT FOR SHEBA'S BREASTS
BUT FINALLY THEY REACHED THIS OASIS WHERE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT BEFELL GEORGE CURTIS ON THE DAY OF THEIR ARRIVAL HE WAS SITTING BY THE STREAM AND JIM WAS EXTRACTING THE HONEY FROM THE NEST OF A STINGLESS BEE
WHICH REPRESENT OUR PASSIONS HOPES FEARS JOYS ASPIRATIONS TOWARDS GOOD AND EVIL AND WHAT NOT ARE TURNED IN HIS MIGHTY HAND
JUST AFTER DINGAAN SWEPT INTO NATAL AND SLAUGHTERED SIX HUNDRED MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN SO THAT THE BOERS NAMED THE PLACE WHERE THEY DIED WEENEN OR THE PLACE OF WEEPING
SAW US ALL ONCE MORE SAFE AND SOUND AT MY LITTLE PLACE ON THE BEREA NEAR DURBAN WHERE I AM NOW WRITING
SUCH AS USED TO BE OWNED BY THE DUTCHMEN A ROER THEY CALL IT THAT GUN THE BOER I BOUGHT IT FROM MANY YEARS AGO TOLD ME HAD BEEN USED BY HIS FATHER AT THE BATTLE OF THE BLOOD RIVER
AND BUILDED BARNS GOODS FOR MY BOY AND BARNS FOR HIM TO STORE THEM IN AND NOW HIS SOUL HAS BEEN REQUIRED OF HIM AND I AM LEFT DESOLATE
GEORGE CURTIS TOLD US HIS STORY WHICH IN ITS WAY WAS ALMOST AS EVENTFUL AS OUR OWN AND PUT SHORTLY AMOUNTED TO THIS A LITTLE LESS THAN TWO YEARS BEFORE HE HAD STARTED FROM SITANDA'S KRAAL
HE IS FURIOUS ESPECIALLY AS SOME ILL NATURED PERSON HAS PRINTED IT IN A SOCIETY PAPER TO COME TO BUSINESS GOOD AND I TOOK THE DIAMONDS TO STREETER'S TO BE VALUED AS WE ARRANGED
ALL THESE THINGS SUGGEST TOUCHES OF KINSHIP AND YOU REMEMBER THAT IN THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF YOUR NATURE YOU ARE QUITE IDENTICAL AS FOR YOU SIR WHO ALSO LAUGH
HIS TIME IS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN SHAVING AND OTHER MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE VAIN ADORNING OF THE BODY
UNDEFILED AS YET BY ANY HUMAN SINKS OF SWELTERING HUMANITY I WOULD GO AGAIN WHERE THE WILD GAME WAS BACK TO THE LAND WHEREOF NONE KNOW THE HISTORY BACK TO THE SAVAGES WHOM I LOVE
WHEN SUDDENLY I STOPPED AND RUBBED MY EYES AS WELL I MIGHT THERE NOT TWENTY YARDS IN FRONT OF ME PLACED IN A CHARMING SITUATION UNDER THE SHADE OF A SPECIES OF FIG TREE
SIR HENRY LAUGHED THEY BELONG TO QUATERMAIN AND GOOD IT WAS A PART OF THE BARGAIN THAT THEY SHOULD DIVIDE ANY SPOILS THERE MIGHT BE THIS REMARK SET ME THINKING
AND ONE WHICH SHOWS HOW WONDERFULLY THINGS ARE BROUGHT ABOUT I WAS WALKING ALONG QUIETLY SOME WAY IN FRONT OF THE OTHER TWO DOWN THE BANKS OF THE STREAM WHICH RUNS FROM THE OASIS TILL IT IS SWALLOWED UP IN THE HUNGRY DESERT SANDS
BEAUTIFULLY SHAVED FROCK COAT FITTING LIKE A GLOVE BRAND NEW EYE GLASS ET CETERA ET CETERA I WENT AND WALKED IN THE PARK WITH HIM WHERE I MET SOME PEOPLE I KNOW AND AT ONCE TOLD THEM THE STORY OF HIS BEAUTIFUL WHITE LEGS
DONE MY BEST TO LEARN THE WAYS OF THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT AND WHAT HAVE I FOUND A GREAT GULF FIXED NO ONLY A VERY LITTLE ONE THAT A PLAIN MAN'S THOUGHT MAY SPRING ACROSS
YOU CAN GO ROUND AND ROUND IT YOU CAN POLISH IT HIGHLY
FINALLY WE PREVAILED UPON HIM TO CONSENT TO THIS ARRANGEMENT BUT GEORGE CURTIS DID NOT KNOW OF IT UNTIL SOME TIME AFTERWARDS
AND REALLY I AM AFRAID TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY PUT THEM AT IT SEEMS SO ENORMOUS
INTO THE SOIL LIKE A TREE IT WILL ONCE MORE SOONER OR LATER FALL AGAIN AS THE EGYPTIAN CIVILIZATION FELL AS THE HELLENIC CIVILIZATION FELL AND AS THE ROMAN CIVILIZATION AND MANY OTHERS
AND FACING TO THE STREAM WAS A COSY HUT BUILT MORE OR LESS ON THE KAFIR PRINCIPLE WITH GRASS AND WITHES BUT HAVING A FULL LENGTH DOOR INSTEAD OF A BEE HOLE
IN A PROMISCUOUS WAY AND FIND ME WHERE YOU LEAST EXPECTED IT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD OF AND THE MOST MERCIFUL TOO THEN SIR HENRY SET TO WORK AND TOLD HIM THE MAIN FACTS OF OUR ADVENTURES
YOU WILL REACH HERE BY CHRISTMAS AND I BOOK YOU TO STAY WITH ME FOR THAT GOOD IS COMING AND GEORGE AND SO BY THE WAY IS YOUR BOY HARRY THERE'S A BRIBE FOR YOU
TO THE CERTAINTY OF PERISHING IN THE DESERT AS FOR FOOD HOWEVER THEY GOT ON PRETTY WELL FOR THEY HAD A GOOD SUPPLY OF AMMUNITION AND THE OASIS WAS FREQUENTED ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT BY LARGE QUANTITIES OF GAME
I WOULD THAT IT HAD BEEN MY SOUL AND NOT MY BOY'S WE BURIED HIM THIS AFTERNOON UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREY AND ANCIENT TOWER OF THE CHURCH OF THIS VILLAGE WHERE MY HOUSE IS
I CANNOT HELP FEELING THAT I AM NOT FAR OFF HARRY WHEN I WAS IN ENGLAND I USED TO LIVE IN A VERY FINE HOUSE AT LEAST I CALL IT A FINE HOUSE SPEAKING COMPARATIVELY
WE DO NOT PROSTRATE OURSELVES BEFORE IT LIKE THE POOR INDIANS WE FLY HITHER AND THITHER WE CRY FOR MERCY BUT IT IS OF NO USE THE BLACK FATE THUNDERS ON
AND LIKE HIM HE IS A COOL YOUNG HAND HE SHOT ME IN THE LEG CUT OUT THE PELLETS AND THEN REMARKED UPON THE ADVANTAGES OF HAVING A MEDICAL STUDENT WITH EVERY SHOOTING PARTY GOOD BYE OLD BOY I CAN'T SAY ANY MORE
AS SUCH STONES HAVE NEVER TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE BEEN PUT ON THE MARKET IN ANYTHING LIKE SUCH QUANTITIES IT APPEARS THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE OR TWO OF THE LARGEST THEY ARE OF THE FINEST WATER
AND IN ITS SEASON REDUCES US TO POWDER POOR HARRY TO GO SO SOON JUST WHEN HIS LIFE WAS OPENING TO HIM HE WAS DOING SO WELL AT THE HOSPITAL
I HAVE JUST BURIED MY BOY MY POOR HANDSOME BOY OF WHOM I WAS SO PROUD AND MY HEART IS BROKEN
AND BEGAN HOBBLING TOWARDS US WHEN HE WAS CLOSE HE FELL DOWN IN A SORT OF FAINT WITH A SPRING SIR HENRY WAS BY HIS SIDE GREAT POWERS HE CRIED
LOOK HERE YOU FELLOWS I SAID IS THAT A WHITE MAN OR AM I MAD SIR HENRY LOOKED AND GOOD LOOKED AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE LAME WHITE MAN WITH A BLACK BEARD UTTERED A GREAT CRY
THE ABOVE SIGNED ALLAN QUATERMAIN IS AN EXTRACT FROM MY DIARY WRITTEN TWO YEARS AND MORE AGO I COPY IT DOWN HERE BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME
IT IS MY BROTHER GEORGE AT THE SOUND OF THIS DISTURBANCE ANOTHER FIGURE ALSO CLAD IN SKINS EMERGED FROM THE HUT A GUN IN HIS HAND AND RAN TOWARDS US
HE HAD PASSED HIS LAST EXAMINATION WITH HONOURS AND I WAS PROUD OF THEM MUCH PROUDER THAN HE WAS I THINK AND THEN HE MUST NEEDS GO TO THAT SMALLPOX HOSPITAL HE WROTE TO ME THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF SMALLPOX
AND THE CHILD OF CIVILIZATION ARE IDENTICAL I DARE SAY THAT THE HIGHLY CIVILIZED LADY READING THIS WILL SMILE AT AN OLD FOOL OF A HUNTER'S SIMPLICITY WHEN SHE THINKS OF HER BLACK BEAD BEDECKED SISTER
ALLAN QUATERMAIN BY H RIDER HAGGARD I INSCRIBE THIS BOOK OF ADVENTURE TO MY SON ARTHUR JOHN RIDER HAGGARD IN THE HOPE THAT IN DAYS TO COME HE
CHAPTER TWENTY FOUND AND NOW I COME TO PERHAPS THE STRANGEST ADVENTURE THAT HAPPENED TO US IN ALL THIS STRANGE BUSINESS
AND WATCH THE LINES OF GAME TRAVELLING DOWN THE RIDGES TO THE WATER THE RULING PASSION IS STRONG IN DEATH THEY SAY AND MY HEART WAS DEAD THAT NIGHT BUT INDEPENDENTLY OF MY TROUBLE
SO THAT WE MAY NOT BE CARRIED AWAY BY THE PRIDE OF KNOWLEDGE MAN'S CLEVERNESS IS ALMOST INDEFINITE AND STRETCHES LIKE AN ELASTIC BAND
ITS STIFF FORMAL MANNERS AND ITS WELL DRESSED CROWDS HE BEGINS TO LONG AH HOW HE LONGS FOR THE KEEN BREATH OF THE DESERT AIR
IT IS VERY HARD HAVING ONLY ONE SON TO LOSE HIM THUS BUT GOD'S WILL BE DONE WHO AM I THAT I SHOULD COMPLAIN THE GREAT WHEEL OF FATE
A KAFIR CAME UP MY AVENUE OF ORANGE TREES CARRYING A LETTER IN A CLEFT STICK WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT FROM THE POST IT TURNED OUT TO BE FROM SIR HENRY AND AS IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF I GIVE IT IN FULL
AND NOW YOU OF ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD YOU WHO AS I FANCIED HAD LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT ME AND WERE LIVING COMFORTABLY IN OLD ENGLAND TURN UP
APPLIED FOR THE GOOD OF ALL OF COURSE THEY HAVE GREAT ADVANTAGES HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE BUT THEN REMEMBER WE BREED THE SICKLY PEOPLE WHO FILL THEM IN A SAVAGE LAND THEY DO NOT EXIST
THEY LOOKED VERY WHITE UPON THE BLACK CLOTH THERE WAS A LITTLE HITCH ABOUT GETTING THE COFFIN DOWN INTO THE GRAVE THE NECESSARY ROPES HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN SO WE DREW BACK FROM IT
I WOULD GO AWAY FROM THIS PLACE WHERE I LIVED IDLY AND AT EASE BACK AGAIN TO THE WILD LAND WHERE I HAD SPENT MY LIFE WHERE I MET MY DEAR WIFE AND POOR HARRY WAS BORN
SERVICEABLE SAVAGE PORTIONS THAT WE FALL BACK ON EMERGENCIES NOT ON THE POLISHED BUT UNSUBSTANTIAL TWENTIETH CIVILIZATION SHOULD WIPE AWAY OUR TEARS
AND THE FELLOW FELL AT MY FEET AND ROLLED OVER AND OVER WEEPING FOR JOY YOU CARELESS SCOUNDREL I SAID YOU OUGHT TO BE WELL SJAMBOCKED THAT IS HIDED MEANWHILE
I HAD GIVEN UP ALL HOPE OF EVER SEEING YOU AGAIN AND NOW I COME ACROSS YOU PERCHED IN THE DESERT LIKE AN OLD ASSVOEGEL
WHO GAVE US BIRTH AND WILL IN A DAY TO COME GIVE US OUR BURIAL ALSO AND SO IN MY TROUBLE AS I WALKED UP AND DOWN THE OAK PANELLED VESTIBULE OF MY HOUSE THERE IN YORKSHIRE
AND SO GEORGE CURTIS ENDED WE HAVE LIVED FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS LIKE A SECOND ROBINSON CRUSOE AND HIS MAN FRIDAY HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT SOME NATIVES MIGHT COME HERE TO HELP US AWAY BUT NONE HAVE COME
SITTING TILL LATE INTO THE NIGHT TO DO IT BY JOVE SAID GEORGE CURTIS WHEN I SHOWED HIM SOME OF THE DIAMONDS WELL AT LEAST YOU HAVE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOUR PAINS BESIDES MY WORTHLESS SELF
YOUR FONDNESS FOR PIGMENTS AND POWDERS THE WAY IN WHICH YOU LOVE TO SUBJUGATE YOURSELF TO THE RICH WARRIOR WHO HAS CAPTURED YOU IN MARRIAGE AND THE QUICKNESS WITH WHICH YOUR TASTE IN FEATHERED HEAD DRESSES VARIES
CIVILIZATION FAILS US UTTERLY BACK BACK WE CREEP AND LAY US LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN ON THE GREAT BREAST OF NATURE SHE THAT PERCHANCE MAY SOOTHE US AND MAKE US FORGET
BESIDES THE QUESTION WILL ARISE HOW MANY OF THESE BLESSINGS ARE DUE TO CHRISTIANITY AS DISTINCT FROM CIVILIZATION AND SO THE BALANCE SWAYS AND THE STORY RUNS
WHICH CAME THITHER FOR WATER THESE THEY SHOT OR TRAPPED IN PITFALLS USING THE FLESH FOR FOOD AND AFTER THEIR CLOTHES WORE OUT THE HIDES FOR CLOTHING
I MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIM TOO I HAVE MONEY ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US AND MUCH MORE THAN ENOUGH KING SOLOMON'S MINES PROVIDED ME WITH THAT BUT I SAID NO LET THE BOY EARN HIS LIVING LET HIM LABOUR
AND SO MANY THINGS GOOD BAD AND INDIFFERENT HAD HAPPENED TO ME THE THIRST FOR THE WILDERNESS WAS ON ME I COULD TOLERATE THIS PLACE NO MORE I WOULD GO AND DIE AS I HAD LIVED
FOR FEAR LEST WE SHOULD FLOOD THE MARKET THEY OFFER HOWEVER A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND FOR A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THEM YOU MUST COME HOME QUATERMAIN AND SEE ABOUT THESE THINGS
MACUMAZAHN HE HALLOED DON'T YOU KNOW ME BAAS I'M JIM THE HUNTER I LOST THE NOTE YOU GAVE ME TO GIVE TO THE BAAS
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL COME IF IT IS ONLY TO OBLIGE
AS SURELY AND AS CERTAINLY AS IT TURNS THE STARS AND CONTINUALLY FALL INTO NEW PATTERNS AND COMBINATIONS BUT THE COMPOSING ELEMENTS REMAIN THE SAME
WHAT DOES IT ALL COME TO FOR FORTY YEARS AND MORE I LIVED AMONG SAVAGES AND STUDIED THEM AND THEIR WAYS AND NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS I HAVE LIVED HERE IN ENGLAND AND HAVE IN MY OWN STUPID MANNER
IF IT IS ONLY TO SEE YOU HARRY MY BOY AND TO LOOK AFTER THE PRINTING OF THIS HISTORY WHICH IS A TASK THAT I DO NOT LIKE TO TRUST TO ANYBODY ELSE
WHICH IS TO BE FOUND IN THE DESERT ON THE TOP OF A BANK IMMEDIATELY ABOVE HIM IN SO DOING HE LOOSENED A GREAT BOULDER OF ROCK WHICH FELL UPON GEORGE CURTIS'S RIGHT LEG CRUSHING IT FRIGHTFULLY
AND HAVING SPOKEN TO GOOD I TOLD SIR HENRY THAT IT WAS OUR JOINT WISH THAT HE SHOULD TAKE A THIRD PORTION OF THE DIAMONDS OR IF HE WOULD NOT THAT HIS SHARE SHOULD BE HANDED TO HIS BROTHER WHO HAD SUFFERED EVEN MORE THAN OURSELVES ON THE CHANCE OF GETTING THEM
AMONG THE WILD GAME AND THE SAVAGES YES AS I WALKED I BEGAN TO LONG TO SEE THE MOONLIGHT GLEAMING SILVERY WHITE OVER THE WIDE VELDT AND MYSTERIOUS SEA OF BUSH
HE TOLD ME THAT SINCE HE HAD BEEN HOME HE HADN'T SEEN A WOMAN TO TOUCH HER EITHER AS REGARDS HER FIGURE OR THE SWEETNESS OF HER EXPRESSION I WANT YOU TO COME HOME MY DEAR OLD COMRADE
HE DREAMS OF THE SIGHT OF ZULU IMPIS BREAKING ON THEIR FOES LIKE SURF UPON THE ROCKS AND HIS HEART RISES UP IN REBELLION AGAINST THE STRICT LIMITS OF THE CIVILIZED LIFE AH THIS CIVILIZATION
IS SPREAD ALL OVER THE OTHER NINETEEN MAKING THEM APPEAR QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THEY REALLY ARE AS THE BLACKING DOES A BOOT OR THE VENEER A TABLE IT IS ON THE NINETEEN ROUGH
BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL A ROBIN REDBREAST CAME AS BOLD AS COULD BE AND LIT UPON THE COFFIN AND BEGAN TO SING AND THEN I AM AFRAID THAT I BROKE DOWN
YOU CAN FINISH WRITING THE STORY OF OUR ADVENTURES ON BOARD SHIP WE HAVE REFUSED TO TELL THE TALE TILL IT IS WRITTEN BY YOU FOR FEAR LEST WE SHALL NOT BE BELIEVED IF YOU START ON RECEIPT OF THIS
NINETEEN SAVAGE AND ONE CIVILIZED WE MUST LOOK TO THE NINETEEN SAVAGE PORTIONS OF OUR NATURE IF WE WOULD REALLY UNDERSTAND OURSELVES AND NOT TO THE TWENTIETH
AND LIKE A NORTHERN LIGHT COMES BUT TO FADE AND LEAVE THE SKY MORE DARK OUT OF THE SOIL OF BARBARISM IT HAS GROWN LIKE A TREE AND AS I BELIEVE
EVEN AS I SAID IT THE DOOR OF THE HUT OPENED AND THERE LIMPED OUT OF IT A WHITE MAN CLOTHED IN SKINS AND WITH AN ENORMOUS BLACK BEARD I THOUGHT THAT I MUST HAVE GOT A TOUCH OF THE SUN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE
BUT WE DID ACCOMPLISH IT SOMEHOW AND TO GIVE ITS DETAILS WOULD ONLY BE TO REPRODUCE MUCH OF WHAT HAPPENED TO US ON THE FORMER OCCASION
OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NOW LOST COUNT FELL ALSO DO NOT LET ME HOWEVER BE UNDERSTOOD AS DECRYING OUR MODERN INSTITUTIONS REPRESENTING AS THEY DO THE GATHERED EXPERIENCE OF HUMANITY
LET SOME MAN COME AND STRIKE YOU IN THE FACE WHILST YOU ARE ENJOYING THAT MARVELLOUS LOOKING DISH AND WE SHALL SOON SEE HOW MUCH OF THE SAVAGE THERE IS IN YOU
HERE A GAIN THERE A LOSS AND NATURE'S GREAT AVERAGE STRUCK ACROSS THE TWO WHEREOF THE SUM TOTAL FORMS ONE OF THE FACTORS IN THAT MIGHTY EQUATION
ALL OF WHICH I HAD SHOT MYSELF THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL SPECIMENS AS I NEVER KEEP ANY HORNS WHICH ARE NOT IN EVERY WAY PERFECT UNLESS IT MAY BE NOW AND AGAIN ON ACCOUNT OF THE ASSOCIATIONS CONNECTED WITH THEM
FETCHED UP ALL RIGHT IN ENGLAND WE GOT OFF THE BOAT AT SOUTHAMPTON AND WENT UP TO TOWN YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT A SWELL
UP AND DOWN THE OAK PANELLED VESTIBULE FOR THERE IS A VESTIBULE IN MY HOUSE IN ENGLAND ON ALL THE FOUR WALLS OF THIS VESTIBULE WERE PLACED PAIRS OF HORNS ABOUT A HUNDRED PAIRS ALTOGETHER
FROM THAT DAY HE HAD BEEN SO LAME THAT HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GO EITHER FORWARD OR BACK
AND SO IT IS CALLED TO THIS DAY AND ALWAYS WILL BE CALLED AND MANY AN ELEPHANT HAVE I SHOT WITH THAT OLD GUN
AND SO DID SIR HENRY CURTIS STRONG MAN THOUGH HE IS AND AS FOR CAPTAIN GOOD I SAW HIM TURN AWAY TOO EVEN IN MY OWN DISTRESS I COULD NOT HELP NOTICING IT
THAT IT IS THE FITTEST BEGINNING TO THE HISTORY THAT I AM ABOUT TO WRITE IF IT PLEASE GOD TO SPARE ME TO FINISH IT IF NOT WELL IT DOES NOT MATTER THAT EXTRACT WAS PENNED SEVEN THOUSAND MILES OR SO
AND WAITED IN SILENCE WATCHING THE BIG FLAKES FALL GENTLY ONE BY ONE LIKE HEAVENLY BENEDICTIONS AND MELT IN TEARS ON HARRY'S PALL
SIX MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF OUR RE ARRIVAL AT SITANDA'S WHERE WE FOUND OUR GUNS AND OTHER GOODS QUITE SAFE THOUGH THE OLD RASCAL IN CHARGE WAS MUCH DISGUSTED AT OUR SURVIVING TO CLAIM THEM
A BOULDER FELL ON MY LEG AND CRUSHED IT AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO NEITHER FORWARD NOR BACK THEN I CAME UP HOW DO YOU DO MISTER NEVILLE I SAID DO YOU REMEMBER ME
AND MANY OTHER BOYS WHOM I SHALL NEVER KNOW MAY IN THE ACTS AND THOUGHTS OF ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS
I TRIED TO CROSS SOLOMON'S MOUNTAINS NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO WAS THE ANSWER SPOKEN IN THE HESITATING VOICE OF A MAN WHO HAS HAD LITTLE RECENT OPPORTUNITY OF USING HIS TONGUE BUT WHEN I REACHED HERE
IT WAS A DREARY DECEMBER AFTERNOON AND THE SKY WAS HEAVY WITH SNOW BUT NOT MUCH WAS FALLING THE COFFIN WAS PUT DOWN BY THE GRAVE AND A FEW BIG FLAKES LIT UPON IT
NO HUNTER EVER CAME TO SUCH A PLACE AS THIS CERTAINLY NO HUNTER WOULD EVER SETTLE IN IT I STARED AND STARED AND SO DID THE OTHER MAN AND JUST AT THAT JUNCTURE SIR HENRY AND GOOD WALKED UP
AND WANTED TO GAIN THE EXPERIENCE AND NOW THE DISEASE HAS KILLED HIM AND I OLD AND GREY AND WITHERED AM LEFT TO MOURN OVER HIM WITHOUT A CHICK OR CHILD TO COMFORT ME
THAT HE MAY ENJOY REST BUT THE REST HAS COME TO HIM BEFORE THE LABOUR OH MY BOY MY BOY I AM LIKE THE MAN IN THE BIBLE WHO LAID UP MUCH GOODS
THERE I MIGHT GO ON FOR EVER BUT WHAT IS THE GOOD CIVILIZATION IS ONLY SAVAGERY SILVER GILT A VAINGLORY IS IT
BUT IF YOU WHOSE EYES MAY PERCHANCE ONE DAY FALL UPON MY WRITTEN THOUGHTS HAVE GOT SO FAR AS THIS I ASK YOU TO PERSEVERE SINCE WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU IS NOT WITHOUT ITS INTEREST
NOR WILL THERE BE ONE MORE BIT OF COLOURED GLASS NOR ONE LESS FOR EVER AND EVER THIS BEING SO SUPPOSING FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT WE DIVIDE OURSELVES INTO TWENTY PARTS
BUT FOR THE LADDER LIKE DESCENT OF THE MOUNTAINS DOWN WHICH WE HAD JUST COME WHICH IS CLEARLY A BETTER ROUTE THAN THAT MARKED OUT IN OLD DOM SILVESTRA'S PLAN IN THE DESERT HE AND JIM HAD SUFFERED GREAT HARDSHIPS
AND KICKED LIKE THE VERY DEUCE WELL UP AND DOWN I WALKED STARING AT THE GUNS AND THE HORNS WHICH THE GUNS HAD BROUGHT LOW AND AS I DID SO THERE ROSE UP IN ME A GREAT CRAVING
IT WAS EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN NOW MY DEAR OLD FELLOW BURST OUT SIR HENRY AT LAST I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD I HAVE BEEN OVER SOLOMON'S MOUNTAINS TO FIND YOU
WHEREBY YOU WILL MAKE IT BULGE OUT THE OTHER BUT YOU WILL NEVER WHILE THE WORLD ENDURES AND MAN IS MAN INCREASE ITS TOTAL CIRCUMFERENCE IT IS THE ONE FIXED UNCHANGEABLE THING
BUT I COULD NOT EAT MUCH AND SOON I TOOK TO WALKING OR RATHER LIMPING BEING PERMANENTLY LAME FROM THE BITE OF A LION UP AND DOWN
IS TO A LARGE EXTENT FREE FROM THE GREED OF MONEY WHICH EATS LIKE A CANCER INTO THE HEART OF THE WHITE MAN IT IS A DEPRESSING CONCLUSION BUT IN ALL ESSENTIALS THE SAVAGE
THEY HAVE A STRONG FAMILY RESEMBLANCE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU WEAR THAT VERY LOW DRESS TO THE SAVAGE WOMAN'S BEADS YOUR HABIT OF TURNING ROUND AND ROUND TO THE SOUND OF HORNS AND TOM TOMS
LYING IN THE CHURCHYARD WITHOUT FEELING AS THOUGH MY HEART WOULD BREAK IN TWO AND NOW THERE IS AN END OF THIS EGOTISTICAL TALK AND THERE SHALL BE NO MORE OF IT
I LONGED ONCE MORE TO THROW MYSELF INTO THE ARMS OF NATURE NOT THE NATURE WHICH YOU KNOW THE NATURE THAT WAVES IN WELL KEPT WOODS AND SMILES OUT IN CORN FIELDS BUT NATURE
FIXED AS THE STARS MORE ENDURING THAN THE MOUNTAINS AS UNALTERABLE AS THE WAY OF THE ETERNAL HUMAN NATURE IS GOD'S KALEIDOSCOPE AND THE LITTLE BITS OF COLOURED GLASS
AND RECOMMENDED US TO SELL BY DEGREES
I HAD TAKEN HER CURE IN HAND AND THE POOR GIRL SEEING MY AIM OBEYED ME IN ORDER TO PROVE HER GRATITUDE I HAD SUCCEEDED WITHOUT EFFORT OR TROUBLE IN ALMOST ISOLATING HER FROM HER FORMER HABITS MY DOCTOR
WE SENT FOR PRUDENCE AND ALL THREE SET OFF AFTER MARGUERITE HAD GIVEN NANINE ORDERS TO TELL THE DUKE THAT SHE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE FINE DAY
WHICH IS VERY DISAGREEABLE DEBTS ARE CONTRACTED ACQUAINTANCES BEGUN ABOUT A GREEN TABLE END BY QUARRELS IN WHICH LIFE OR HONOUR COMES TO GRIEF AND THOUGH ONE MAY BE AN HONEST MAN ONE FINDS ONESELF RUINED BY VERY HONEST MEN
AND THAT HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE THAT LET MARGUERITE LEAVE THE YOUNG MAN HE SAID TO ME AND AS IN THE PAST I WILL GIVE HER ALL THAT SHE REQUIRES IF NOT LET HER ASK NOTHING MORE FROM ME
AS PRUDENCE HAD TOLD US IT WAS THE REAL COUNTRY AND I MUST ADD IT WAS A REAL LUNCH IT IS NOT ONLY OUT OF GRATITUDE FOR THE HAPPINESS I OWE IT
ASKING FOR A NOTE FOR A THOUSAND FRANCS PROFESSEDLY ON BEHALF OF MARGUERITE YOU KNOW I HAD WON SOME MONEY AT GAMBLING I THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY HANDED OVER TO PRUDENCE WHAT SHE ASKED FOR MARGUERITE
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL CONTINUED MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE IS THERE I HAVE BEEN SEEING ABOUT A PLACE FOR ARMAND TO STAY IN THE SAME HOUSE ASKED PRUDENCE LAUGHING
I FEARED ABOVE ALL THAT SHE MIGHT THINK ME CAPABLE OF SHIRKING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF EVERY CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HER LOVE FOR ME MIGHT LEAD HER IT THUS CAME ABOUT THAT THE DUKE RECEIVING NO REPLY CEASED TO WRITE
WHERE THERE IS STILL A CERTAIN RIGOUR IN REGARD TO PAYMENTS ONE IS ALMOST CERTAIN THE MOMENT ONE GAINS A CONSIDERABLE SUM NOT TO RECEIVE IT YOU WILL READILY UNDERSTAND WHY GAMBLING IS ONLY LIKELY TO BE CARRIED ON BY YOUNG PEOPLE
HOWEVER MARGUERITE'S PLEASURE IN SEEING HER FRIENDS WAS A LITTLE MODERATED WHEN SHE SAW THE EXPENSE WHICH THAT PLEASURE ENTAILED AND ESPECIALLY THE NECESSITY SHE WAS SOMETIMES IN OF ASKING ME FOR MONEY THE DUKE
AND HAVING FALLEN UPON A PARTY OF FIFTEEN WHO WERE STILL AT LUNCH AT AN HOUR WHEN HE WAS PREPARED TO SIT DOWN TO DINNER HE HAD UNSUSPECTINGLY OPENED THE DINING ROOM DOOR AND HAD BEEN GREETED BY A BURST OF LAUGHTER
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST AN EXISTENCE
THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL HER AND I HAD LISTENED AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM INTO WHICH THEY HAD SHUT THEMSELVES NOT LONG AFTER PRUDENCE RETURNED AGAIN I WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE GARDEN WHEN SHE ARRIVED AND SHE DID NOT SEE ME
WELL IT IS ALL SETTLED SHE SAID AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE IS TAKEN ASKED PRUDENCE YES HE AGREED AT ONCE I DID NOT KNOW THE DUKE BUT I FELT ASHAMED OF DECEIVING HIM
MARGUERITE GOT ACCUSTOMED TO THIS NEW EXISTENCE WHOSE SALUTARY EFFECTS SHE ALREADY REALIZED SHE BEGAN TO SPEND SOME OF HER EVENINGS AT HOME OR IF THE WEATHER WAS FINE SHE WRAPPED HERSELF IN A SHAWL PUT ON A VEIL AND WE WENT ON FOOT
PRUDENCE ON HER SIDE BROUGHT DOWN ALL THE PEOPLE SHE KNEW AND DID THE HONOURS OF THE HOUSE AS IF THE HOUSE BELONGED TO HER THE DUKE'S MONEY PAID FOR ALL THAT AS YOU MAY IMAGINE BUT FROM TIME TO TIME PRUDENCE CAME TO ME
HAD ALMOST COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED AT THE END OF SIX WEEKS THE COUNT WAS ENTIRELY GIVEN UP AND ONLY THE DUKE OBLIGED ME TO CONCEAL MY LIAISON WITH MARGUERITE AND EVEN HE WAS SENT AWAY WHEN I WAS THERE
I FLUNG MYSELF INTO THIS RAPID NOISY AND VOLCANIC LIFE WHICH HAD FORMERLY TERRIFIED ME WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AND WHICH HAD BECOME FOR ME THE NECESSARY COMPLEMENT OF MY LOVE FOR MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE COULD I HAVE DONE
AND FOR WHOM ELSE SHOULD I BURY MYSELF HERE IF NOT FOR YOU WELL THEN MARGUERITE LET ME TAKE IT MYSELF YOU ARE MAD NOT ONLY IS IT UNNECESSARY BUT IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS
MARGUERITE'S NATURE WAS VERY CAPRICIOUS AND LIKE SO MANY WOMEN SHE NEVER REGARDED AS A SERIOUS EXPENSE THOSE THOUSAND AND ONE DISTRACTIONS WHICH MADE UP HER LIFE SO WISHING TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH ME AS POSSIBLE
NO AT POINT DU JOUR WHERE WE HAD DINNER THE DUKE AND I
WELL TELL THE DUKE TO TAKE IT FOR YOU HE WOULD DO SO I AM SURE I'LL SEE ABOUT IT IF YOU LIKE MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCEPT IT SAVE FROM ONE MAN LET ME ALONE BIG BABY AND SAY NOTHING THAT MEANS SAID PRUDENCE THAT WHEN I HAVE TWO DAYS FREE I WILL COME AND SPEND THEM WITH YOU
NOTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE AS THEIR CAPRICES FLOWERS BOXES AT THE THEATRE SUPPERS DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WHICH ONE CAN NEVER REFUSE TO ONE'S MISTRESS AS I HAVE TOLD YOU I HAD LITTLE MONEY
I TOOK IT WAS I RIGHT I FLUNG MY ARMS AROUND HER NECK AND KISSED HER IT WILL BE CHARMING SHE CONTINUED YOU HAVE THE KEY OF THE LITTLE DOOR AND I HAVE PROMISED THE DUKE THE KEY OF THE FRONT DOOR
AND BY THIS I KNEW THE VIOLENCE OF MY LOVE I LEFT THE TABLE WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION WHETHER I WAS WINNING OR LOSING PITYING THOSE WHOM I LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT LIKE ME FIND THEIR REAL HAPPINESS IN LEAVING IT
MOUNTING AS HIGH AS THE FIRST STORY I LOOKED AT THE HOUSE SO LONG THAT I BEGAN BY THINKING OF IT AS MINE SO PERFECTLY DID IT EMBODY THE DREAM THAT I WAS DREAMING I SAW MARGUERITE AND MYSELF THERE
BE AT PRUDENCE'S TO NIGHT AT EIGHT
A WEEK LATER MARGUERITE WAS SETTLED IN HER COUNTRY HOUSE AND I WAS INSTALLED AT POINT DU JOUR THEN BEGAN AN EXISTENCE WHICH I SHALL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN DESCRIBING TO YOU
THE BREEZE THE SHINING SOLITUDE OF FIELDS OR WOODS HOWEVER MUCH ONE LOVES A WOMAN WHATEVER CONFIDENCE ONE MAY HAVE IN HER WHATEVER CERTAINTY HER PAST MAY OFFER US AS TO HER FUTURE ONE IS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS JEALOUS
NO MORE BARRIERS MY MARGUERITE WE LOVE WHAT MATTERS ALL THE REST OH YES I LOVE YOU MY ARMAND SHE MURMURED PUTTING HER TWO ARMS AROUND MY NECK I LOVE YOU AS I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD EVER LOVE
MARGUERITE ROSE FROM TABLE AND JOINED THE DUKE IN THE NEXT ROOM WHERE SHE TRIED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO INDUCE HIM TO FORGET THE INCIDENT BUT THE OLD MAN WOUNDED IN HIS DIGNITY BORE HER A GRUDGE FOR IT
VERY MUCH IN NEED OF MONEY AND NOT POSSESSING THE FORTUNE NECESSARY FOR SUPPORTING THE LIFE THEY LEAD THEY GAMBLE THEN AND WITH THIS RESULT OR ELSE THEY GAIN AND THEN THOSE WHO LOSE SERVE TO PAY FOR THEIR HORSES AND MISTRESSES
AND YOU REPLIED THAT I WOULD REPORT HIS DECISION TO YOU AND I PROMISED HIM THAT I WOULD BRING YOU INTO A MORE REASONABLE FRAME OF MIND ONLY THINK MY DEAR CHILD OF THE POSITION THAT YOU ARE LOSING
STEWED RABBIT AND ALL THE REST OF THE TRADITIONAL LUNCH IN THE COUNTRY WE HAD NOW ONLY TO DECIDE WHERE WE SHOULD GO IT WAS ONCE MORE PRUDENCE WHO SETTLED THE DIFFICULTY DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE REAL COUNTRY SHE ASKED YES
YES AN EXCELLENT IDEA I STAMMERED NOT KNOWING WHAT I WAS SAYING WELL I WILL ARRANGE THAT SAID MARGUERITE FREEING MY HAND AND INTERPRETING MY WORDS ACCORDING TO HER OWN DESIRE
ANY ONE WHO HAD SEEN US LEAVING THE HOUSE TO GO ON THE RIVER IN THE CHARMING LITTLE BOAT WHICH I HAD BOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE WEARING A STRAW HAT
ARMAND ORDER AN OPEN CARRIAGE AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER WE WERE AT WIDOW ARNOULD'S PERHAPS YOU KNOW THE INN WHICH IS A HOTEL ON WEEK DAYS AND A TEA GARDEN ON SUNDAYS
WHERE ASKED PRUDENCE YONDER AND MARGUERITE POINTED TO THE HOUSE IN QUESTION AH DELICIOUS REPLIED PRUDENCE DO YOU LIKE IT VERY MUCH
THE COURTESAN DISAPPEARED LITTLE BY LITTLE I HAD BY ME A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHOM I LOVED AND WHO LOVED ME AND WHO WAS CALLED MARGUERITE THE PAST HAD NO MORE REALITY AND THE FUTURE NO MORE CLOUDS
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I RECEIVED THIS NOTE
FORGIVE ME IF I GIVE YOU ALL THESE DETAILS BUT YOU WILL SEE THAT THEY WERE THE CAUSE OF WHAT WAS TO FOLLOW WHAT I TELL YOU IS A TRUE AND SIMPLE STORY AND I LEAVE TO IT ALL THE NAIVETE OF ITS DETAILS
BEYOND DISTINCT IN THE SUNLIGHT RISE LITTLE WHITE HOUSES WITH RED ROOFS AND MANUFACTORIES WHICH AT THAT DISTANCE PUT AN ADMIRABLE FINISH TO THE LANDSCAPE BEYOND THAT PARIS IN THE MIST
THE DUKE WROTE TO HER TWO OR THREE TIMES SHE RECOGNISED THE WRITING AND GAVE ME THE LETTERS WITHOUT READING THEM SOMETIMES THE TERMS OF THESE LETTERS BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES HE HAD IMAGINED THAT BY CLOSING HIS PURSE TO MARGUERITE
WELL SAID MARGUERITE WELL I HAVE SEEN THE DUKE WHAT DID HE SAY THAT HE WOULD GLADLY FORGIVE YOU IN REGARD TO THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE
AND BEHIND THE HOUSE A LITTLE WOOD FULL OF MYSTERIOUS RETREATS WHERE THE MOSS MUST EFFACE EACH MORNING THE PATHWAY THAT HAD BEEN MADE THE DAY BEFORE CLIMBING FLOWERS CLUNG ABOUT THE DOORWAY OF THIS UNINHABITED HOUSE
CHAPTER SIXTEEN I MIGHT HAVE TOLD YOU OF THE BEGINNING OF THIS LIAISON IN A FEW LINES BUT I WANTED YOU TO SEE EVERY STEP BY WHICH WE CAME I TO AGREE TO WHATEVER MARGUERITE WISHED
AS NOT TO KNOW THAT I WAS LIVING THEM I BEGAN BY BORROWING FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND FRANCS ON MY LITTLE CAPITAL AND WITH THIS I TOOK TO GAMBLING SINCE GAMBLING HOUSES WERE DESTROYED GAMBLING GOES ON EVERYWHERE
AND OF HER UNITY AT THE CONTACT OF MEN AND THINGS AS FOR ME I EXPERIENCED THAT MORE THAN MOST MINE WAS NOT AN ORDINARY LOVE I WAS AS MUCH IN LOVE AS AN ORDINARY CREATURE COULD BE
AFTER A BUTTERFLY OR A DRAGON FLY THIS COURTESAN WHO HAD COST MORE MONEY IN BOUQUETS THAN WOULD HAVE KEPT A WHOLE FAMILY IN COMFORT WOULD SOMETIMES SIT ON THE GRASS FOR AN HOUR EXAMINING THE SIMPLE FLOWER WHOSE NAME SHE BORE
PRUDENCE WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO SEEM MADE ON PURPOSE FOR DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WITH HER UNCHANGING GOOD HUMOUR AND HER ETERNAL APPETITE SHE NEVER LEFT A DULL MOMENT TO THOSE WHOM SHE WAS WITH AND WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY IN ORDERING EGGS CHERRIES MILK
AND I WILL NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT I AM LIVING WITH HIM IT IS FOLLY NO DOUBT BUT I LOVE HIM WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO AND THEN NOW THAT HE HAS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE ALWAYS WITH ME
AND COULD NOT FORGIVE HER HE SAID TO HER SOMEWHAT CRUELLY THAT HE WAS TIRED OF PAYING FOR THE FOLLIES OF A WOMAN WHO COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HIM TREATED WITH RESPECT UNDER HIS OWN ROOF AND HE WENT AWAY IN GREAT INDIGNATION
THE TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO JOIN MY FATHER AND SISTER HAD NOW ARRIVED AND I DID NOT GO BOTH OF THEM WROTE TO ME FREQUENTLY BEGGING ME TO COME TO THESE LETTERS I REPLIED AS BEST I COULD
FORMERLY WHEN ONE WENT TO FRASCATI ONE HAD THE CHANCE OF MAKING A FORTUNE ONE PLAYED AGAINST MONEY AND IF ONE LOST THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CONSOLATION OF SAYING THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE GAINED WHEREAS NOW EXCEPT IN THE CLUBS
AND I WILL SAY GOOD BYE FOREVER TO THE LIFE FOR WHICH I NOW BLUSH YOU WON'T EVER REPROACH ME FOR THE PAST TELL ME TEARS CHOKED MY VOICE I COULD ONLY REPLY BY CLASPING MARGUERITE TO MY HEART WELL
THE SUN SHONE UPON MY MISTRESS AS IT MIGHT HAVE SHONE UPON THE PUREST BRIDE WE WALKED TOGETHER IN THOSE CHARMING SPOTS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON PURPOSE TO RECALL THE VERSES OF LAMARTINE OR TO SING THE MELODIES OF SCUDO
MARGUERITE WAS NO LONGER THE SAME WOMAN THAT I HAD KNOWN SHE AVOIDED EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT RECALL TO ME THE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN LEADING WHEN I FIRST MET HER NEVER DID WIFE OR SISTER SURROUND HUSBAND OR BROTHER WITH SUCH LOVING CARE AS SHE HAD FOR ME
MY DREAM VANISHED AT THE LAST WORDS OF PRUDENCE AND BROUGHT ME BACK TO REALITY SO BRUTALLY THAT I WAS STILL STUNNED WITH THE FALL
IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT SHE READ MANON LESCAUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I FOUND HER SEVERAL TIMES MAKING NOTES IN THE BOOK AND SHE ALWAYS DECLARED THAT WHEN A WOMAN LOVES SHE CAN NOT DO AS MANON DID
BY DAY IN THE LITTLE WOOD THAT COVERED THE HILLSIDE IN THE EVENING SEATED ON THE GRASS AND I ASKED MYSELF IF EARTHLY CREATURES HAD EVER BEEN SO HAPPY AS WE SHOULD BE WHAT A PRETTY HOUSE MARGUERITE SAID TO ME
AS BEFORE NO MATTER ON WHAT CONDITIONS I READ THESE URGENT AND REPEATED LETTERS AND TORE THEM IN PIECES WITHOUT TELLING MARGUERITE WHAT THEY CONTAINED AND WITHOUT ADVISING HER TO SEE THE OLD MAN AGAIN
AND THAT ARMAND CAN NEVER GIVE YOU HE LOVES YOU WITH ALL HIS SOUL BUT HE HAS NO FORTUNE CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING YOUR NEEDS AND HE WILL BE BOUND TO LEAVE YOU ONE DAY WHEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE AND WHEN THE DUKE WILL REFUSE TO DO ANY MORE FOR YOU
I WISHED ABOVE ALL NOT TO LEAVE MYSELF TIME TO THINK OVER THE POSITION I HAD ACCEPTED FOR IN SPITE OF MYSELF IT WAS A GREAT DISTRESS TO ME THUS MY LIFE GENERALLY SO CALM
WHEN AN ADROIT GAMBLER WOULD HAVE LEFT IT SETTLING ONE THING AGAINST ANOTHER I FOUND MYSELF IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS
COVERING HER HANDS WITH TEARS IN MY JOY AT BEING THUS LOVED MY LIFE IS YOURS MARGUERITE YOU NEED THIS MAN NO LONGER AM I NOT HERE SHALL I EVER LEAVE YOU AND CAN I EVER REPAY YOU FOR THE HAPPINESS THAT YOU GIVE ME
AND ALL THE SIMPLICITY OF ITS DEVELOPMENTS I REALIZED THEN THAT AS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD MAKE ME FORGET MY MISTRESS IT WAS NEEDFUL FOR ME TO FIND SOME WAY OF MEETING THE EXPENSES INTO WHICH SHE DREW ME THEN TOO
WHOSE ONLY DEFECT IS THAT THEY HAVE NOT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR I NEED NOT TELL YOU OF THOSE WHO CHEAT AT PLAY
MARGUERITE TO BE UNABLE TO LIVE APART FROM ME IT WAS THE DAY AFTER THE EVENING WHEN SHE CAME TO SEE ME THAT I SENT HER MANON LESCAUT FROM THAT TIME SEEING THAT I COULD NOT CHANGE MY MISTRESS'S LIFE I CHANGED MY OWN
AND I HAD COME TO LIVE ENTIRELY AT HER HOUSE THE SERVANTS ADDRESSED ME OFFICIALLY AS THEIR MASTER PRUDENCE HAD STRICTLY SERMONIZED MARGUERITE IN REGARD TO HER NEW MANNER OF LIFE BUT SHE HAD REPLIED THAT SHE LOVED ME THAT SHE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT ME
AND WE SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING PERFECT THE DUKE IS GOING TO LOOK AFTER EVERY SINGLE THING AH MY DEAR SHE ADDED KISSING ME YOU'RE IN LUCK IT'S A MILLIONAIRE WHO MAKES YOUR BED FOR YOU
AND THAT HAPPEN WHAT MIGHT SHE WOULD NOT SACRIFICE THE PLEASURE OF HAVING ME CONSTANTLY WITH HER ADDING THAT THOSE WHO WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT WERE FREE TO STAY AWAY SO MUCH I HAD HEARD ONE DAY WHEN PRUDENCE HAD SAID TO MARGUERITE
ALWAYS REPEATING THAT I WAS QUITE WELL AND THAT I WAS NOT IN NEED OF MONEY TWO THINGS WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD CONSOLE MY FATHER FOR MY DELAY IN PAYING HIM MY ANNUAL VISIT JUST THEN ONE FINE DAY IN SUMMER
I CAME TO PARIS STUDIED LAW WAS CALLED TO THE BAR AND LIKE MANY OTHER YOUNG MEN PUT MY DIPLOMA IN MY POCKET AND LET MYSELF DRIFT AS ONE SO EASILY DOES IN PARIS
I WILL DO WITHOUT IT BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO I DON'T IN THE LEAST KNOW PRUDENCE WAS NO DOUBT GOING TO MAKE SOME REPLY BUT I ENTERED SUDDENLY AND FLUNG MYSELF AT MARGUERITE'S FEET
MY LOVE FOR HER HAD SO DISTURBING AN INFLUENCE UPON ME THAT EVERY MOMENT I SPENT AWAY FROM MARGUERITE WAS LIKE A YEAR AND THAT I FELT THE NEED OF CONSUMING THESE MOMENTS IN THE FIRE OF SOME SORT OF PASSION
SHE WOULD WRITE TO ME IN THE MORNING THAT SHE WOULD DINE WITH ME NOT AT HOME BUT AT SOME RESTAURANT IN PARIS OR IN THE COUNTRY I WOULD CALL FOR HER AND WE WOULD DINE AND GO ON TO THE THEATRE OFTEN HAVING SUPPER AS WELL
HE WOULD BRING HER BACK TO HIM BUT WHEN HE HAD PERCEIVED THE USELESSNESS OF THESE MEANS HE COULD HOLD OUT NO LONGER
AND FEARING LEST SHE SHOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN I POSSESSED I BORROWED AT PARIS A SUM EQUAL TO THAT WHICH I HAD ALREADY BORROWED AND PAID BACK I WAS THEN ONCE MORE IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WITHOUT RECKONING MY ALLOWANCE
WAS THAT MARGUERITE GAUTIER WHO ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO HAD BEEN THE TALK OF THE TOWN FOR THE LUXURY AND SCANDAL OF HER EXISTENCE ALAS WE MADE HASTE TO BE HAPPY AS IF WE KNEW THAT WE WERE NOT TO BE HAPPY LONG
I LOST ONLY WHAT I WAS ABLE TO PAY AND GAINED ONLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOSE FOR THE REST CHANCE WAS ON MY SIDE I MADE NO DEBTS AND I SPENT THREE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AS WHEN I DID NOT GAMBLE
WE BREATHED TOGETHER THAT TRUE LIFE WHICH NEITHER MARGUERITE NOR I HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE HER DELIGHT IN THE SMALLEST THINGS WAS LIKE THAT OF A CHILD THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE RAN IN THE GARDEN LIKE A CHILD OF TEN
LET US GO AND SEE IF IT IS TO LET THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY AND TO LET FOR TWO THOUSAND FRANCS WOULD YOU BE HAPPY HERE SHE SAID TO ME AM I SURE OF COMING HERE
FOR THE MOST OF THEM GAMBLING WAS A NECESSITY FOR ME IT WAS A REMEDY FREE OF MARGUERITE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE OF GAMBLING THUS IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT I PRESERVED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF SELF POSSESSION
HE HAS ASKED ME HOW I LOVING PARIS AS I DO COULD MAKE UP MY MIND TO BURY MYSELF IN THE COUNTRY I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS ILL AND THAT I WANTED REST HE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING ME
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN NEXT DAY MARGUERITE SENT ME AWAY VERY EARLY SAYING THAT THE DUKE WAS COMING AT AN EARLY HOUR AND PROMISING TO WRITE TO ME THE MOMENT HE WENT AND TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE EVENING
I PASSED WHOLE DAYS AT THE FEET OF MY MISTRESS WE OPENED THE WINDOWS UPON THE GARDEN AND AS WE WATCHED THE SUMMER RIPENING IN ITS FLOWERS
FAR THAT MY MISTRESS NOW BELONGED TO ME MORE COMPLETELY AND MY DREAM WAS AT LENGTH REALIZED MARGUERITE COULD NOT BE WITHOUT ME NOT CARING WHAT THE RESULT MIGHT BE SHE PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED OUR LIAISON
ADD TO THIS THAT FROM THE PLACE WHERE I WAS I COULD SEE ON THE SHORE A CHARMING LITTLE HOUSE OF TWO STORIES WITH A SEMICIRCULAR RAILING THROUGH THE RAILING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE A GREEN LAWN SMOOTH AS VELVET
THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT VIEW FROM THE GARDEN WHICH IS AT THE HEIGHT OF AN ORDINARY FIRST FLOOR ON THE LEFT THE AQUEDUCT OF MARLY CLOSES IN THE HORIZON
ASSUMED ALL AT ONCE AN APPEARANCE OF NOISE AND DISORDER NEVER BELIEVE HOWEVER DISINTERESTED THE LOVE OF A KEPT WOMAN MAY BE THAT IT WILL COST ONE NOTHING
I HAVE TRAVELLED A GOOD DEAL AND SEEN MUCH GRANDER THINGS
THOUGH I WAS HALF INCLINED TO SO MUCH DID I PITY HIM BUT I WAS AFRAID LEST IF I SO ADVISED HER SHE SHOULD THINK THAT I WISHED THE DUKE NOT MERELY TO COME AND SEE HER AGAIN BUT TO TAKE OVER THE EXPENSES OF THE HOUSE
LIKE TWO CHILDREN IN THE DIM ALLEYS OF THE CHAMPS ELYSEES SHE WOULD COME IN TIRED TAKE A LIGHT SUPPER AND GO TO BED AFTER A LITTLE MUSIC OR READING WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN USED TO DO THE COUGH
FOR THE REST NOT A PENNY OF DEBT THIS THEN WAS MY POSITION WHEN I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MARGUERITE YOU CAN WELL UNDERSTAND THAT IN SPITE OF MYSELF MY EXPENSES SOON INCREASED
FOR TWO MONTHS WE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TO PARIS NO ONE CAME TO SEE US EXCEPT PRUDENCE AND JULIE DUPRAT OF WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU
AND WHEN SHALL YOU MOVE INTO THE HOUSE INQUIRED PRUDENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WILL YOU TAKE YOUR HORSES AND CARRIAGE I SHALL TAKE THE WHOLE HOUSE AND YOU CAN LOOK AFTER MY PLACE WHILE I AM AWAY
MY FATHER WAS AND STILL IS RECEVEUR GENERAL AT C HE HAS A GREAT REPUTATION THERE FOR LOYALTY THANKS TO WHICH HE WAS ABLE TO FIND THE SECURITY WHICH HE NEEDED IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THIS POSITION
SAID SHE TURNING TO PRUDENCE AND SPEAKING IN A BROKEN VOICE YOU CAN REPORT THIS SCENE TO THE DUKE AND YOU CAN ADD THAT WE HAVE NO LONGER NEED OF HIM FROM THAT DAY FORTH THE DUKE WAS NEVER REFERRED TO
WHOM I HAD MADE HER MEET HAD TOLD ME THAT ONLY REST AND CALM COULD PRESERVE HER HEALTH SO THAT IN PLACE OF SUPPER AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS I SUCCEEDED IN SUBSTITUTING A HYGIENIC REGIME AND REGULAR SLEEP IN SPITE OF HERSELF
AND WHO HAD NO CONCERN WITH US ALONE WITH NATURE IN THE SPRING TIME OF THE YEAR THAT ANNUAL PARDON AND SHUT OFF FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY I COULD HIDE MY LOVE AND LOVE WITHOUT SHAME OR FEAR
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SPEAK TO ARMAND MARGUERITE SEEMED TO BE THINKING FOR SHE ANSWERED NOTHING MY HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY WHILE I WAITED FOR HER REPLY NO SHE ANSWERED I WILL NOT LEAVE ARMAND
THEN SHE SOMETIMES CAME TO DINE WITH ME ONE MORNING I DID NOT GO TILL EIGHT AND THERE CAME A DAY WHEN I DID NOT GO TILL TWELVE BUT SOONER THAN THE MORAL METAMORPHOSIS A PHYSICAL METAMORPHOSIS CAME ABOUT IN MARGUERITE
WE LEFT THE HOUSE AND STARTED ON OUR RETURN TO PARIS TALKING OVER THE NEW PLAN
AS FOR HER SHE CONTINUED TO LOVE ME AS MUCH OR EVEN MORE THAN EVER AS I TOLD YOU I BEGAN BY BEING ALLOWED TO STAY ONLY FROM MIDNIGHT TO SIX O'CLOCK THEN I WAS ASKED SOMETIMES TO A BOX IN THE THEATRE
WHILE GAMBLING GAVE A NEW TURN TO THE FEVER WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE PREYED UPON MY HEART AND FIXED IT UPON A PASSION WHICH LAID HOLD ON ME IN SPITE OF MYSELF UNTIL THE HOUR STRUCK WHEN I MIGHT GO TO MY MISTRESS THEN
SINCE THAT DAY HE HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF IN VAIN MARGUERITE DISMISSED HER GUESTS CHANGED HER WAY OF LIFE THE DUKE WAS NOT TO BE HEARD OF I WAS THE GAINER IN SO
IF YOU HAVE BEEN IN LOVE YOU MUST HAVE FELT THE NEED OF ISOLATING FROM THIS WORLD THE BEING IN WHOM YOU WOULD LIVE WHOLLY IT SEEMS AS IF HOWEVER INDIFFERENT SHE MAY BE TO HER SURROUNDINGS THE WOMAN WHOM ONE LOVES LOSES SOMETHING OF HER PERFUME
MARGUERITE WAS AWAKENED BY THE SUNLIGHT POURING INTO HER ROOM AND JUMPING OUT OF BED ASKED ME IF I WOULD TAKE HER INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE WHOLE DAY
MY EXPENSES WERE VERY MODERATE ONLY I USED UP MY YEAR'S INCOME IN EIGHT MONTHS AND SPENT THE FOUR SUMMER MONTHS WITH MY FATHER WHICH PRACTICALLY GAVE ME TWELVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR AND IN ADDITION THE REPUTATION OF A GOOD SON
MARGUERITE WAS DRESSED IN WHITE SHE LEANED ON MY ARM SAYING OVER TO ME AGAIN UNDER THE STARRY SKY THE WORDS SHE HAD SAID TO ME THE DAY BEFORE AND FAR OFF THE WORLD WENT ON ITS WAY
UNDER THE PRETEXT THAT SHE WAS ASLEEP AND HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT SHE WAS NOT TO BE AWAKENED THE HABIT OR THE NEED OF SEEING ME WHICH MARGUERITE HAD NOW CONTRACTED HAD THIS GOOD RESULT THAT IT FORCED ME TO LEAVE THE GAMING TABLE JUST AT THE MOMENT

HE HEARD THE SHUFFLING FEET OF THE QUARRY GANG HIS EARS CAUGHT THE CLINK OF THE CHAINS WHICH BOUND THEM TOGETHER THEY WERE DESPERATE MEN PECULIARLY INTERESTING TO HIM AND HE HAD WATCHED THEIR FACES FURTIVELY IN THE EARLY PERIOD
REPLIED BRYCE PROMPTLY OF THE OTHER THE MAN OF LESSER IMPORTANCE FLOOD
IF I HAVE MY PRICE IT'S NOT IN THE SAME COMMODITY THAT GLASSDALE WOULD WANT BUT BEFORE WE DO ANY TALKING ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING I WANT TO ADD TO MY STOCK OF KNOWLEDGE LOOK HERE WE'LL BE CANDID I DON'T CARE A SNAP OF MY FINGERS THAT BRAKE
IT WAS A SQUARE BUILDING OF OLD STONE ITS WALLS UNLINED UNPLASTERED ITS FLOOR PAVED WITH MUCH WORN FLAGS OF LIMESTONE EVIDENTLY SET DOWN IN A LONG DEAD AGE
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT HE SHOULD SEE IT
BEFORE THE SECOND MAN SPOKE WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR HE ASKED IN A LOW VOICE MURDER SAID JOHN LEXMAN LACONICALLY HE HAD ANSWERED THE QUESTION BEFORE
YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN HIS FAMILY AFFAIRS SAID BRYCE WHAT BECAME OF BRAKE'S WIFE AND CHILDREN WHEN HE WENT TO PRISON FOLLIOT SHOOK HIS HEAD
IT WAS ALL SO INCREDIBLE SO IMPOSSIBLE HE EXPECTED TO WAKE UP
NOT MINE MY LAD ANSWERED FOLLIOT CONFIDENTLY THAT'S A FACT BRYCE HESITATED GIVING FOLLIOT A SEARCHING LOOK AND FOLLIOT NODDED SOLEMNLY I TELL YOU NOT MINE HE REPEATED I'D NAUGHT TO DO WITH IT
HAD THAT PUT IN HE CONTINUED AND TURNED THE TOP OF THE BUILDING INTO A LITTLE SNUGGERY COME UP HE LED THE WAY TO A FLIGHT OF STEPS IN ONE CORNER OF THE LOWER ROOM PUSHED OPEN A DOOR AT THEIR HEAD
YOU'D HAVE A JOB TO GET IT RETORTED FOLLIOT SUPPOSING THAT ALL YOU SAY IS TRUE ABOUT ABOUT PAST MATTERS NOTHING CAN PROVE NOTHING
AND LEAVING HIM TO PAY THE PENALTY OF HIS OVER TRUSTFULNESS CLEARED OUT OF ENGLAND AND CARRIED HIS MONEY MAKING TALENTS TO FOREIGN PARTS HE SUCCEEDED IN DOING WELL
HE WAS A MAN OF TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE LITHE AND ALERT BY NO MEANS BAD LOOKING
BRYCE LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION POINTED OUT BEHIND THE PERGOLA OF RAMBLER ROSES THE FIGURES OF MEN WERE COMING TOWARDS THE OLD WELL HOUSE LED BY ONE OF FOLLIOT'S GARDENERS SUDDENLY THEY EMERGED INTO FULL VIEW
I'VE DISCOVERED A GREAT DEAL MORE MUCH MORE THAN'S KNOWN TO ANYBODY FOLLIOT THREW ONE LEG OVER THE OTHER AND BEGAN TO JOG HIS FOOT OH HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE DEAR ME AND WHAT MIGHT YOU KNOW NOW DOCTOR AUGHT YOU CAN TELL ME EH
HE WAS EVIDENTLY THINKING DEEPLY AND BRYCE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DISTURB HIM SOME MINUTES WENT BY BEFORE FOLLIOT TOOK THE CIGAR FROM HIS LIPS AND LEANING AGAINST THE CHIMNEYPIECE LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HIS VISITOR LOOK HERE MY LAD HE SAID EARNESTLY
THE WORLD HE LOVED AND THE WORLD THAT KNEW HIM AND ALL THAT THERE WAS IN LIFE ALL THAT WAS WORTH WHILE HAD BEEN CRUSHED AND OBLITERATED INTO THE GRANITE OF THE PRINCETOWN QUARRIES
NEW INTERESTS MADE UP HIS EXISTENCE THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD WAS ONE THE CHARACTER OF THE BOOK HE WOULD RECEIVE FROM THE PRISON LIBRARY ANOTHER THE FUTURE MEANT SUNDAY CHAPEL THE PRESENT WHATEVER TASK THEY FOUND HIM
AND NOW POLISHED TO MARBLE LIKE SMOOTHNESS IN ITS MIDST SET FLUSH WITH THE FLOOR WAS WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY A TRAP DOOR FURNISHED WITH A HEAVY IRON RING TO THIS FOLLIOT POINTED
AND AS THE AEROPLANE FELL HE HAD TIME TO OBSERVE THAT A BOAT HAD BEEN PUT OFF THEN WITH A JERK THE MONOPLANE FLATTENED OUT AND CAME LIKE A SKIMMING BIRD TO THE SURFACE OF THE WATER HER ENGINES STOPPED
NEVER ONCE DID HE FEEL THE CAR SLACKEN ITS PACE UNTIL WITH A GRIND OF BRAKES IT STOPPED SUDDENLY GET OUT SAID A VOICE JOHN LEXMAN THREW OFF THE COVER AND LEAPT OUT AND AS HE DID SO
AND WHO'S RANSFORD THEN I NEVER HEARD BRAKE SPEAK OF ANY RANSFORD WHAT GAME IS ALL THIS WHAT BEFORE BRYCE COULD REPLY FOLLIOT SUDDENLY STARTED THRUST HIS COMPANION ASIDE AND WENT TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS
FORTUNATE FOR YOU MISTER FOLLIOT THAT THE POLICE DON'T KNOW ALL THAT I KNOW FOR IF THEY DID THOSE MARKS WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU DAYS AGO FOR A MINUTE OR TWO FOLLIOT SAT JOGGLING HIS LEG A BAD SIGN IN HIM OF RISING TEMPER
THE FACT IS I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU SO
I MEAN ABOUT RECENT MATTERS REPLIED BRYCE I'VE INTERESTED MYSELF IN THEM FOR REASONS OF MY OWN EVER SINCE BRADEN WAS FOUND AT THE FOOT OF THOSE STAIRS IN PARADISE AND I WAS FETCHED TO HIM I'VE INTERESTED MYSELF AND
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO
I SHOULDN'T WONDER REMARKED BRYCE REFLECTIVELY AND ALMOST AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF I SHOULDN'T AT ALL WONDER IF GLASSDALE'S THE SORT OF MAN WHO CAN BE BOUGHT HE NO DOUBT HAS HIS PRICE BUT ALL THAT GLASSDALE KNOWS IS NOTHING
BRAKE HAD EVIDENTLY A BELIEF IN THESE MEN AND HE TRUSTED THEM UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIMSELF HE SOMETIMES TRUSTED THE BANK'S MONEY TO THEM I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HE USED TO LET THEM HAVE MONEY FOR SHORT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TO BE REFUNDED
WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY SAID THE OTHER I HAVE NO REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU AS YET KARA BREATHED LEXMAN A WORD FROM YOU COULD HAVE SAVED ME I COULD NOT LIE MY DEAR LEXMAN
BUT IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ALL SIGNS OF THE LAND WERE BLOTTED OUT TALKING WAS IMPOSSIBLE THE ROAR OF THE ENGINES DEFIED PENETRATION KARA WAS EVIDENTLY A SKILFUL PILOT
HE DARE NOT LET HIS MIND DWELL UPON THE LONG ACHING YEARS AHEAD HE DARE NOT THINK OF THE WOMAN HE LEFT OR LET HIS MIND DWELL UPON THE AGONY WHICH SHE WAS ENDURING HE HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE WORLD
FOR THE DAY HE WAS TO PAINT SOME DOORS AND WINDOWS OF AN OUTLYING COTTAGE A COTTAGE OCCUPIED BY A WARDER WHO FOR SOME REASON ON THE DAY PREVIOUS HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
VIEWED FROM THE HEIGHT AT WHICH THEY FLEW IT LOOKED NO MORE THAN A WHITE SPECK IN A GREAT BLUE SAUCER BUT PRESENTLY THE MACHINE BEGAN TO DIP FALLING AT A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED WHICH TOOK AWAY THE BREATH OF THE MAN WHO WAS HANGING ON WITH BOTH HANDS
BEFORE TESTING THE LIFE OF A CONVICT ESTABLISHMENT HE BELIEVED THERE WAS SOME TALK OF SENDING HIM TO PARKHURST AND HERE HE TRACED THE INFLUENCE WHICH T X WOULD EXERCISE FOR PARKHURST WAS A PRISONER'S PARADISE
ONE NATURALLY ADOPTS THEIR POINT OF VIEW AND SEES LIFE THROUGH THEIR DISTORTED VISION I BET I'M NOT GIVEN AWAY WITH THE NEXT LOT THE PRISONER WENT ON I'VE GOT ONE OF THE BIGGEST IDEAS I'VE EVER HAD AND I'VE GOT A REAL GOOD MAN TO HELP ME
WHOM HE WAS ABOUT TO CONDUCT TO THE SCAFFOLD LIFTED HIS GLASS AND DRANK A GOOD DEAL HE ANSWERED
AND HAD CARRIED HIS OWN GLASS TO ANOTHER EASY CHAIR DID FOLLIOT REFER TO ANY REASON FOR BRYCE'S VISIT BUT ONCE SETTLED DOWN HE LOOKED AT HIM SPECULATIVELY WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME ABOUT HE ASKED
HOW ASKED JOHN IN SURPRISE THE MAN JERKED HIS HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISON LARRY GREEN HE SAID BRIEFLY HE'S COMING OUT NEXT MONTH TOO AND WE ARE ALL FIXED UP PROPER WE ARE GOING TO GET THE PILE
A SHARP EXCLAMATION FROM HIM TOOK BRYCE TO HIS SIDE FOLLIOT LIFTED A SHAKING HAND AND POINTED INTO THE GARDEN THERE HE WHISPERED HELL AND WHAT'S THIS MEAN
AND EVENTUALLY HE CAME BACK AND MARRIED A RICH WIDOW AND SETTLED HIMSELF DOWN IN AN OUT OF THE WORLD ENGLISH TOWN TO GROW ROSES YOU'RE FALKINER WRAYE YOU KNOW MISTER FOLLIOT BRYCE LAUGHED AS HE MADE THIS DIRECT ACCUSATION
AS HE DID SO HE FELT THE CAR LEAP FORWARD UNDERNEATH HIM NOW IT WAS GOING FAST NOW FASTER NOW IT ROCKED AND SWAYED AS IT GATHERED SPEED HE FELT IT SWEEPING DOWN HILL AND UP HILL
GOOD PLACE FOR THAT CERTAINLY AGREED BRYCE FOLLIOT POINTED HIS VISITOR TO ONE OF THE BIG CHAIRS AND TURNING TO A CABINET BROUGHT OUT SOME GLASSES A SYPHON OF SODA WATER AND A HEAVY CUT GLASS DECANTER
WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY TAKEN BY THE PRISON STAFF AND IT WAS TO THE DECORATION OF ONE OF THESE THAT A O FORTY THREE HAD BEEN SENT THE HOUSE WAS AS YET WITHOUT A TENANT A PAPER HANGER UNDER THE CHARGE OF ANOTHER WARDER
AT THE SIDE OF THE SEAT HE PASSED IT BACK JOHN LEXMAN READ IF YOU CANNOT SWIM THERE IS A LIFE BELT UNDER YOUR SEAT JOHN NODDED KARA WAS SEARCHING THE SEA FOR SOMETHING AND PRESENTLY HE FOUND IT
TO CHOOSE HIS OWN DINNER TO ANSWER NO CALL SAVE THE CALL OF HIS CONSCIENCE TO SEE HE CHECKED HIMSELF WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR HE ASKED IN SELF DEFENCE CONSPIRACY AND FRAUD SAID THE OTHER CHEERFULLY
WITH A GLANCE OF SIGNIFICANT INTEREST DEEPEST WELL IN ALL WRYCHESTER UNDER THAT HE REMARKED YOU'D NEVER THINK IT IT'S A HUNDRED FEET DEEP AND MORE DRY NOW
THAT HE WAS COMING TO SEE YOU BUT I KNOW WHAT PUT THE NOTION INTO HIS HEAD I GAVE HIM COPIES OF THOSE TWO REWARD BILLS HE NO DOUBT THOUGHT HE MIGHT MAKE A BIT AND SO HE CAME IN TO TOWN AND TO YOU WELL ASKED FOLLIOT
TO THE DANGEROUS SEAT BEHIND HE WAS DEADLY COLD
WHEN THAT CAR COMES ABREAST OF THE GATE ASK NO QUESTIONS AND JUMP INTO IT GET DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM AND PULL A SACK OVER YOU AND DO NOT GET UP UNTIL THE CAR STOPS THE BLOOD RUSHED TO JOHN LEXMAN'S HEAD AND HE STAGGERED
PASSING THROUGH DRIFTING CLOUDS
WAS WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE PAINTER THE TWO WARDERS EXCHANGED GREETINGS
LEFT BARTHORPE END SETTLED IN LONDON BRAKE AND THIS MAN BEGAN TO HAVE SOME SECRET DEALINGS TOGETHER THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN IN WITH THEM TOO
BEYOND THE VILLAGE OF PRINCETOWN AND ON THE TAVISTOCK ROAD
HE WANTED TO FIND THOSE TWO MEN AND BEGAN A LONG SEARCH FOR THEM LIKE TO KNOW THE NAMES OF THE MEN MISTER FOLLIOT YOU MIGHT MENTION EM IF YOU KNOW EM ANSWERED FOLLIOT THE NAME OF THE PARTICULAR ONE WAS WRAYE FALKINER WRAYE
A PRETTY COIL HE SAID WITH A SNEER HERE YOU TALKED ABOUT MY PRICE I'M QUITE CONTENT TO HOLD MY TONGUE IF YOU'D TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO WHAT ASKED FOLLIOT YOU KNEW BRAKE
NOW THEN WHO IS HE FOLLIOT REPLIED WITH A SHREWD GLANCE A MAN WHO BY GIVING AWAY ANOTHER MAN GAVE HIMSELF AWAY WOULD BE A DAMNED FOOL HE ANSWERED IF THERE IS ANOTHER MAN AS IF THERE MUST BE INTERRUPTED BRYCE
FORTY THREE HE CALLED SHARPLY I WANT YOU DOWN HERE JOHN TOOK HIS PAINT POT AND BRUSH AND WENT CLATTERING DOWN THE UNCARPETED STAIRS WHERE'S THE OTHER MAN ASKED THE WARDER IN A LOW VOICE
WHICH MARKS THE CONVICT HIS HEAD WAS CLIPPED SHORT
IN THAT PART OF FOLLIOT'S BIG GARDEN I WANT A BIT OF TALK WITH YOU SAID BRYCE AS FOLLIOT CLOSED THE DOOR AND TURNED DOWN A SIDE PATH TO A STILL MORE RETIRED REGION PRIVATE TALK LET'S GO WHERE IT'S QUIET
WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ASKED FOLLIOT
FOLLIOT NODDED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF EXPRESSION AYE DOCTOR HE SAID AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT GLASSDALE NOW BRYCE WHO WOULD HAVE CHEERFULLY HOBNOBBED WITH A MAN
NOW HE SAW THE POINT FOR WHICH KARA WAS MAKING A WHITE STEAM YACHT LONG AND NARROW OF BEAM WAS STEAMING SLOWLY WESTWARD HE COULD SEE THE FEATHERY WAKE IN HER REAR
BUT BRYCE SAW THAT HIS COOL ALMOST INDIFFERENT MANNER WAS CHANGING HE WAS BEGINNING UNDER THE SURFACE TO GET ANXIOUS WHEN I LEFT GLASSDALE AT NOON CONTINUED BRYCE I'D NO IDEA AND I DON'T THINK HE HAD
AS LEXMAN GATHERED FROM A GLIMPSE OF THE CREW BY GREEKS HE SCRAMBLED ABOARD AND FIVE MINUTES LATER HE WAS STANDING ON THE WHITE DECK OF THE YACHT WATCHING THE DISAPPEARING TAIL OF THE MONOPLANE KARA WAS BY HIS SIDE
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HORSES BUT ONLY A GREAT BAT LIKE MACHINE WITH OUT STRETCHED PINIONS OF TAUT WHITE CANVAS AND BY THAT MACHINE
JOHN STUMBLED DOWN THE SLOPE AS HE NEARED THE MACHINE HE STOPPED AND GASPED KARA HE SAID AND THE BROWN MAN SMILED BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
WHICH SHOWED THAT HE KNEW HE HAD THE WHIP HAND SHALL I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT FALKINER WRAYE HE ASKED I WILL IT'S DEEPLY INTERESTING MISTER FALKINER WRAYE AFTER CHEATING AND DECEIVING BRAKE
HE HEARD HIS WARDER'S VOICE BEHIND HIM RIGHT TURN FORTY THREE QUICK MARCH HE WALKED AHEAD OF THE ARMED GUARD THROUGH THE GREAT AND GLOOMY GATES OF THE PRISON TURNED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT AND WALKED UP THE VILLAGE STREET
HE'S UPSTAIRS IN THE BACK ROOM THE WARDER STEPPED OUT OF THE DOOR AND LOOKED LEFT AND RIGHT COMING UP FROM PRINCETOWN WAS A BIG GREY CAR PUT DOWN YOUR PAINT POT HE SAID HIS VOICE WAS SHAKING WITH EXCITEMENT I AM GOING UPSTAIRS
FROM TIME TO TIME HE CONSULTED THE COMPASS ON THE BOARD BEFORE HIM AND CHANGED HIS COURSE EVER SO SLIGHTLY PRESENTLY HE RELEASED ONE HAND FROM THE DRIVING WHEEL AND SCRIBBLING ON A LITTLE BLOCK OF PAPER WHICH WAS INSERTED IN A POCKET
AND MOTIONED BRYCE TO ENTER QUIET ENOUGH IN HERE DOCTOR HE OBSERVED YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS PLACE BIT OF A FANCY OF MINE BRYCE ABSORBED AS HE WAS IN THE THOUGHTS OF THE MOMENT
AND ONCE HE HEARD A HOLLOW RUMBLE AS IT CROSSED A WOODEN BRIDGE HE COULD NOT DETECT FROM HIS HIDING PLACE IN WHAT DIRECTION THEY WERE GOING BUT HE GATHERED THEY HAD SWITCHED OFF TO THE LEFT
FOR A MOMENT HE THOUGHT HE WAS ALONE AND LOOKED AROUND
A WIDE TERM REMARKED FOLLIOT
JOHN LEXMAN LOOKED DOWN HE SAW THE INDENTATIONS OF THE COAST
COOL IN SUMMER WARM IN WINTER MODERN FIRE GRATE YOU NOTICE
AND BY THAT TIME THEY WILL PICK US UP HIS VOICE WAS HIGH AND HARSH IN THE ALMOST PAINFUL SILENCE WHICH FOLLOWED THE STOPPAGE OF THE ENGINES IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE BOAT HAD COME ALONGSIDE MANNED
IF BRYCE HAD BUT KNOWN IT WHILE HE REMAINED SILENT HE WATCHED BRYCE NARROWLY AND WHEN HE SPOKE HIS VOICE WAS CALM AS EVER
AND THE FACE OF THE DRIVER WAS HALF ENVELOPED IN A BIG RUBBER MASK THROUGH THE TWO GREAT GOGGLES JOHN COULD SEE LITTLE TO HELP HIM IDENTIFY THE MAN AS THE MACHINE CAME UP TO THE GATE HE LEAPT INTO THE TONNEAU AND SANK INSTANTLY TO THE BOTTOM
BRYCE IN HIS EAGERNESS AND SURPRISE GRASPED FOLLIOT'S ARM AND SHOOK IT GOOD HEAVENS MAN HE SAID THOSE TWO WARDS OF RANSFORD'S ARE BRAKE'S GIRL AND BOY DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT DIDN'T YOU NEVER ANSWERED FOLLIOT NEVER
AND THEN SUDDENLY THE JERKY PROGRESS CEASED THE MACHINE SWAYED GENTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND LOOKING OVER THE PASSENGER SAW THE GROUND RECEDE BENEATH HIM UP UP THEY CLIMBED IN ONE LONG SWEEPING ASCENT
WATER GAVE OUT SOME YEARS AGO SOME PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PULLED THIS OLD WELL HOUSE DOWN BUT NOT ME I DID BETTER I TURNED IT TO GOOD ACCOUNT HE RAISED A HAND AND POINTED UPWARD TO AN OBVIOUSLY MODERN CEILING OF STRONG OAK TIMBERS
WHICH CAME INTO THE EYES OF THE QUESTIONER WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FIFTEEN YEARS SAID THE OTHER THAT MEANS ELEVEN YEARS AND NINE MONTHS SAID THE FIRST MAN YOU'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE I SUPPOSE HARDLY SAID LEXMAN DRILY
THE TWO OR THREE CHAIRS WERE DEEP AND BIG ENOUGH TO LIE DOWN IN THE TWO WINDOWS COMMANDED PLEASANT VIEWS OF THE CATHEDRAL TOWERS ON ONE SIDE AND OF THE CLOSE ON THE OTHER NICE LITTLE PLACE TO BE ALONE IN D'YE SEE SAID FOLLIOT
MY WIFE SHE IS WAITING FOR YOU SAID THE OTHER HE TURNED HIS HEAD LISTENING
YOU'RE NO DOUBT AS YOU SAY A GOOD HAND AT FINDING THINGS OUT AND YOU'VE DOUBTLESS DONE A GOOD BIT OF FERRETING AND DONE IT WELL ENOUGH IN YOUR OWN OPINION BUT THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN'T FIND OUT AND THE POLICE CAN'T FIND OUT EITHER
LOTS ANSWERED BRYCE I CAME TO TELL YOU ON SEEING THAT GLASSDALE HAD BEEN WITH YOU BECAUSE I WAS WITH GLASSDALE THIS MORNING FOLLIOT MADE NO ANSWER
I WAS HERE WHEN I WAS A KID CONFESSED THE PAPER HANGER I AM GOING OUT NEXT WEEK JOHN LEXMAN LOOKED AT HIM ENVIOUSLY HAD THE MAN TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD INHERITED A GREAT FORTUNE AND A GREATER TITLE
HIS ENVY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO GENUINE GOING OUT THE DRIVE IN THE BRAKE TO THE STATION THE RIDE TO LONDON IN CREASED BUT COMFORTABLE CLOTHING FREE AS THE AIR AT LIBERTY TO GO TO BED AND RISE WHEN HE LIKED
HE STOOD IT TO THE TUNE OF TEN YEARS PENAL SERVITUDE
WITH A CERTAIN KINDNESS AND A CERTAIN RESPECT WHICH WAS UNUSUAL FACE THE WALL GROWLED A VOICE AND MECHANICALLY HE TURNED HIS HANDS STILL BEHIND HIM AND STOOD STARING AT THE GREY WALL OF THE PRISON STOREHOUSE
HE TURNED AT THE SOUND OF A VOICE HE WAS STANDING ON THE SLOPE OF A SMALL TOR AT THE FOOT THERE WAS A SMOOTH STRETCH OF GREEN SWARD IT WAS ON THIS STRETCH THAT THE PEOPLE OF DARTMOOR HELD THEIR PONY RACES IN THE SUMMER MONTHS
HE CLICKED OVER A LEVER AND WITH A ROAR THE BIG THREE BLADED TRACTOR SCREW SPUN THE AEROPLANE MOVED FORWARD WITH A JERK
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE OLD WELL HOUSE WHEN BRYCE CAME HURRYING UP TO HIM FOLLIOT WAS STANDING AT HIS GARDEN DOOR WITH HIS HANDS THRUST UNDER HIS COAT TAILS THE VERY PICTURE OF A BENEVOLENT LEISURED GENTLEMAN
TO WHAT I KNOW FOLLIOT HAD ALLOWED HIS CIGAR TO GO OUT HE THREW IT AWAY TOOK A FRESH ONE FROM THE BOX AND SLOWLY STRUCK A MATCH AND LIGHTED IT WHAT MIGHT YOU KNOW NOW HE ASKED AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE
YOU'RE WRONG HE ANSWERED I NEVER AT ANY TIME KNEW ANYTHING OF BRAKE'S FAMILY AFFAIRS SO LITTLE INDEED THAT I NEVER EVEN KNEW HE WAS MARRIED BRYCE ROSE TO HIS FEET AND STOOD STARING WHAT HE EXCLAIMED
LEAVING THE OTHER IN CHARGE OF BOTH MEN FOR AN HOUR THEY WORKED IN SILENCE UNDER THE EYES OF THE GUARD PRESENTLY THE WARDER WENT OUTSIDE AND JOHN LEXMAN HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING HIS FELLOW SUFFERER
YOU SAID JUST NOW THAT YOU'D NO DOUBT THAT MAN GLASSDALE COULD BE BOUGHT AND I'M INCLINING TO THINK THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE MEN THAT HAVE THEIR PRICE WHAT IS IT WE'VE NOT COME TO THAT RETORTED BRYCE YOU'RE A BIT MISTAKEN
YOU HAVEN'T TIME FOR ARGUMENT THEY DISCOVERED YOUR ESCAPE HE SAID GET IN JOHN CLAMBERED UP INTO THE FRAIL BODY OF THE MACHINE AND KARA FOLLOWED THIS IS A SELF STARTER HE SAID ONE OF THE NEWEST MODELS OF MONOPLANES
UPON HIS HAGGARD FACE STANDING WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM HE WAITED FOR THE MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD BE ORDERED TO HIS WORK JOHN LEXMAN A O FORTY THREE
AND ABOUT WHO KILLED HIM AND WHY THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY OF DOING ALL THAT SORT OF THING YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK A LONG WAY BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNINGS I WENT BACK TO THE TIME WHEN BRADEN WAS MARRIED NOT AS BRADEN OF COURSE
OF HIS IMPRISONMENT HE HAD BEEN SENT TO DARTMOOR AFTER SPENDING THREE MONTHS IN WORMWOOD SCRUBBS OLD HANDS HAD TOLD HIM VARIOUSLY THAT HE WAS FORTUNATE OR UNLUCKY IT WAS USUAL TO HAVE TWELVE MONTHS AT THE SCRUBBS
BUT NEITHER YOU NOR THE POLICE NOR ANYBODY COULD FASTEN ME TO EITHER MATTER GRANTING ALL YOU SAY TO BE TRUE WHERE'S THE POSITIVE TRUTH WHAT ABOUT CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ASKED BRYCE
HE NODDED AT A BOX OF CIGARS WHICH LAY OPEN ON A TABLE AT BRYCE'S ELBOW AS HE BEGAN TO MIX A COUPLE OF DRINKS HELP YOURSELF HE SAID GOOD STUFF THOSE NOT UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN BRYCE A DRINK
AND THEN TO HIS LEFT HAND FALKINER WRAYE HE SAID HAD AN UNFORTUNATE GUN ACCIDENT IN HIS YOUTH WHICH MARKED HIM FOR LIFE HE LOST THE MIDDLE FINGER OF HIS LEFT HAND AND HE GOT A BAD SCAR ON HIS LEFT JAW THERE THEY ARE THOSE MARKS
THEN WHO HAD DEMANDED BRYCE WAS IT THE OTHER MAN FLOOD AND IF SO WHO IS FLOOD FOLLIOT GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND CIGAR BETWEEN HIS LIPS AND HANDS UNDER THE TAILS OF HIS OLD COAT
WITHIN A VERY BRIEF SPACE BUT HE WENT TO THE FIRE TOO OFTEN AND GOT HIS FINGERS BURNED IN THE END THE TWO MEN DID HIM ONE OF THEM IN PARTICULAR AND CLEARED OUT HE HAD TO STAND THE RACKET
THAT COLLISHAW'S DEAD NOR IF ONE HAD HIS NECK BROKEN AND THE OTHER WAS POISONED BUT WHOSE HAND WAS THAT WHICH THE MASON VARNER SAW THAT MORNING WHEN BRAKE WAS FLUNG OUT OF THAT DOORWAY COME NOW WHOSE
THEN HE'S SAFE CONCLUDED FOLLIOT YOU'LL GET NOTHING FROM ME ABOUT HIM AND NOBODY CAN GET AT YOU EXCEPT THROUGH HIM ASKED BRYCE THAT'S ABOUT IT ASSENTED FOLLIOT LACONICALLY BRYCE LAUGHED CYNICALLY
THERE GOES FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS SAID THE GREEK WITH A SMILE
WITHOUT REPLYING IN WORDS TO THIS SUGGESTION FOLLIOT LED THE WAY THROUGH HIS ROSE TREES TO A FAR CORNER OF HIS GROUNDS WHERE AN OLD BUILDING OF GREY STONE COVERED WITH IVY STOOD AMONGST HIGH TREES
NOT MUCH IN THAT FOR THE REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY HE CONTINUED BUT BRAKE HAD OTHER ASSOCIATIONS WITH BARTHORPE A BIT LATER HE GOT TO KNOW GOT INTO CLOSE TOUCH WITH A BARTHORPE MAN WHO ABOUT THE TIME OF BRAKE'S MARRIAGE
ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN PROVE EASILY THAT I NEVER DID MEET HIM I CAN ACCOUNT FOR EVERY MINUTE OF MY TIME THAT DAY AS TO THE OTHER AFFAIR NOT AN OUNCE OF DIRECT EVIDENCE THEN IT WAS THE OTHER MAN EXCLAIMED BRYCE
WHICH DISTINGUISHED THE MAJORITY OF THE INHABITANTS AT DARTMOOR THEY WAITED UNTIL THEY HEARD THE WARDER'S STEP CLEAR THE PASSAGE AND UNTIL HIS IRON SHOD BOOTS WERE TRAMPING OVER THE COBBLED PATH WHICH LED FROM THE DOOR THROUGH THE TINY GARDEN TO THE ROAD
WHICH TOLD JOHN AS CLEARLY AS THOUGH THE MAN HAD CONFESSED AS MUCH THAT HE HAD NEVER OCCUPIED ANY SOCIAL POSITION IN LIFE THE WARDER'S STEP ON THE STONES OUTSIDE REDUCED THEM TO SILENCE SUDDENLY HIS VOICE CAME UP THE STAIRS
AND CLOSE BEHIND HIM THE DETECTIVE
MY GOD HE WHISPERED DO AS I TELL YOU HISSED THE WARDER LIKE AN AUTOMATON JOHN PUT DOWN HIS BRUSHES AND WALKED SLOWLY TO THE GATE THE GREY CAR WAS CRAWLING UP THE HILL
WAS FOUND A SUBSTANCE UNLIKE ANYTHING BEFORE OBSERVED BY ANYONE WHO SAW IT IT WAS A BOWL SHAPED OBJECT ABOUT EIGHT INCHES IN DIAMETER AND ONE INCH THICK BRIGHT BUFF COLORED AND HAVING UPON IT A
FALLS OF VISCID SUBSTANCE IN THE YEARS SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO SIXTEEN EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN NINETY SIX EIGHTEEN ELEVEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR
HE GIVES EARLIER DATES BUT I PRACTICE EXCLUSIONS MYSELF IN THE REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIXTY THREE
EXCEPT THAT IN THE SEVEN THERE WAS A LAPSE OF SEVERAL YEARS AND WHERE WAS THE VOLCANIC DUST ALL THAT TIME
ALMOST ALWAYS THE EXCLUSIONISTS ARGUE
DISTRIBUTION OF THE DUST OF KRAKATOA VELOCITY OF TRANSLATION
LUMPS OF JELLY WERE FOUND ON THE GROUND AT RAHWAY NEW JERSEY THE SUBSTANCE WAS WHITISH OR RESEMBLED THE COAGULATED WHITE OF AN EGG THAT MISTER H H GARLAND OF NELSON COUNTY VIRGINIA HAD FOUND A JELLY LIKE SUBSTANCE
BUT BEFORE EVENING TWO OTHERS SPRANG UP OR WE'VE ARRIVED AT ONE OF THE OLDEST OF THE EXCLUSIONISTS CONVENTIONS OR NOSTOC WE SHALL HAVE MANY DATA
THAT NOTHING BUT THIS FALLING SUBSTANCE WAS VISIBLE IN THE SKY IT FELL IN FLAKES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME TWO INCHES SQUARE
HAD BEEN FOUND AT NEARLY THE SAME PLACE PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK WAS INVITED BY PROFESSOR GRAVES TO EXAMINE IT EXACTLY LIKE THE FIRST ONE CORRESPONDED IN SIZE AND COLOR AND CONSISTENCY THE CHEMIC REACTIONS WERE THE SAME PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK
HAD SEEN A MASS THE SIZE OF A TEACUP IT LOOKED LIKE BOILED STARCH THAT ACCORDING TO A NEWSPAPER OF NEWARK NEW JERSEY A MASS OF GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE LIKE SOFT SOAP HAD BEEN FOUND
OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE TWO POUNDERS AUTHENTICATED AND SIX POUNDERS REPORTED AT SERINGAPATAM INDIA ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FELL A HAILSTONE
THE WRITER ABANDONS THE FIRST OR ABSOLUTE EXCLUSION AND MODIFIES IT WITH THE EXPLANATION THAT THE DAY BEFORE A REPORTED FALL OF STONES IN TUSCANY JUNE SIXTEENTH SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR THERE HAD BEEN AN ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS
EARLY IN AUGUST EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR THOUSANDS OF JELLYFISH ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHILLING HAD FALLEN AT BATH ENGLAND I THINK IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT THEY WERE JELLYFISH BUT IT DOES LOOK
IT IS SAID THAT WHATEVER THEY WERE THEY COULD NOT BE EATEN THAT IN THE PAN
STORY OF A HIGHLY UNPLEASANT SUBSTANCE THAT HAD FALLEN FROM THE SKY IN WILSON COUNTY TENNESSEE WE READ THAT DOCTOR TROOST VISITED THE PLACE AND INVESTIGATED LATER WE'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE SOME INVESTIGATIONS
OF EXTERNALLY DERIVED SUBSTANCES THAT FALL UPON THIS EARTH AS THAT THEY ARE INIMICAL TO ALL DATA DISCORDANT WITH A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE SUCH PHENOMENA
FOR EITHER SPAWN OR NOSTOC GREG'S COMMENT IN THIS INSTANCE IS CURIOUS IF TRUE BUT HE RECORDS WITHOUT MODIFICATION THE FALL OF A METEORITE AT GOTHA GERMANY SEPTEMBER SIXTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE
THAT FAR INTO OUR OWN TIMES SOME SCIENTISTS NOTABLY PROFESSOR LAWRENCE SMITH AND SIR ROBERT BALL CONTINUED TO HOLD OUT AGAINST ALL EXTERNAL ORIGINS ASSERTING THAT NOTHING COULD FALL TO THIS EARTH
SMALL FROGS FELL AT WIGAN ENGLAND NATURE EIGHTY SEVEN TEN THAT JUNE TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN ELEVEN AT ETON BUCKS ENGLAND THE GROUND WAS FOUND COVERED WITH MASSES OF JELLY THE SIZE OF PEAS
AND THAT HOT STONES MAY BE PICKED UP WHERE A LUMINOUS OBJECT SEEMINGLY HAD LANDED ONLY LIGHTNING STRIKING A STONE HEATING EVEN MELTING IT THE STONE OF LUCE SHOWED SIGNS OF FUSION
THE EXCLUSIONISTS EXPLANATION AT THAT TIME WAS THAT STONES DO NOT FALL FROM THE SKY
UPON REMOVING THIS COVERING A BUFF COLORED PULPY SUBSTANCE OF THE CONSISTENCY OF SOFT SOAP WAS FOUND OF AN OFFENSIVE SUFFOCATING SMELL
GRAYISH OR WHITISH GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE IS NOT NOSTOC AND IS NOT SPAWN IF OCCURRING IN TIMES UNSEASONABLE FOR SPAWN THE KENTUCKY PHENOMENON
THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BELONG HERE LONDON TIMES APRIL NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX FALL OF FISH THAT HAD OCCURRED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
AND IN MOST OF THEM SEGREGATION IS THE GREAT MYSTERY A WHIRLWIND SEEMS ANYTHING BUT A SEGREGATIVE FORCE SEGREGATION OF THINGS THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY HAS BEEN AVOIDED AS MOST DEEP DYED OF THE DAMNED
NEVERTHELESS HE ENDORSES THE LOCAL EXPLANATION AND A BIZARRE THING IT IS A FLOCK OF GORGED HEAVY WEIGHTED BUZZARDS BUT FAR UP AND INVISIBLE IN THE CLEAR SKY
ONE SMILES IN MONTANA IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FELL SNOWFLAKES FIFTEEN INCHES ACROSS AND EIGHT INCHES THICK MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW NINETEEN FIFTEEN SEVENTY THREE
OR DATA OF THEM BOMBARDED THE WALLS RAISED AGAINST THEM MONTHLY REVIEW
THAT THEY HAD SCATTERED THE DECAYING FLESH OF A DEAD HOG OVER THE TOBACCO FIELDS IF WE DON'T ACCEPT THIS DATUM
HAD BLOWN UP TERRIFIC WE'RE TOLD THAT THE SOUND WAS HEARD TWO THOUSAND MILES AND THAT THIRTY SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY PERSONS WERE KILLED SEEMS JUST A LITTLE UNSCIENTIFIC OR IMPOSITIVE TO ME
THE NEXT MORNING IN PROFESSOR DEWEY'S FRONT YARD IN WHAT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN THE ONLY POSITION FROM WHICH THE LIGHT THAT HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE ROOM THE NIGHT BEFORE COULD HAVE BEEN REFLECTED
AND THE NEW YORK TIMES MARCH TENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THEN THE EXCLUSIONISTS SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE BEEF ONE FLAKE OF IT THE SIZE OF A SQUARE ENVELOPE
MAY SIXTEENTH OR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR IS THE DATE GIVEN IN THE JOURNAL
SOMETHING OCCURRED IN BATH COUNTY KENTUCKY THAT BROUGHT MANY NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS TO THE SCENE THE SUBSTANCE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEEF THAT FELL FROM THE SKY
EXPRESSED IN THE SUPPLEMENT IS AMUSING TO SOME OF US WHO I FEAR MAY BE A LITTLE IMPROPER AT TIMES VERY SPIRIT OF THE SALVATION ARMY WHEN SOME THIRD RATE SCIENTIST COMES OUT WITH AN EXPLANATION OF THE VERMIFORM APPENDIX
TO ACCEPT CONNECTION OR THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST VAST GELATINOUS AREAS ALOFT AND THAT METEORITES TEAR THROUGH CARRYING DOWN SOME OF THE SUBSTANCE
SO TO KNOW WAS CONVENIENT WHEN WE COME TO REPORTED FALLS OF GELATINOUS SUBSTANCES I'D LIKE IT TO BE NOTICED HOW OFTEN THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS WHITISH OR GRAYISH IN LOOKING UP THE SUBJECT MYSELF I HAVE READ ONLY
IT SEEMS MORE ACCEPTABLE THAT ONLY CERTAIN AREAS ARE
IT IS SAID THAT THE FISH WERE OF THE CHALWA SPECIES ABOUT A SPAN IN LENGTH AND A SEER IN WEIGHT YOU KNOW THEY WERE DEAD AND DRY OR
BUT POSITIVENESS AND THE FATE OF EVERY POSITIVE STATEMENT IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY TO THINK OF DAMNED STONES RAISING AN OUTCRY AGAINST A SENTENCE OF EXCLUSION BUT SUBJECTIVELY
IT HAD BEEN EXAMINED AND DESCRIBED BY PROFESSOR GRAVES FORMERLY LECTURER AT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE IT WAS AN OBJECT THAT HAD UPON IT A NAP SIMILAR TO THAT OF MILLED CLOTH UPON REMOVING THIS NAP
THAT HAS EVER BEEN ACCEPTABLY TRACED TO TERRESTRIAL ORIGIN FALLING STONES HAD TO BE UNDAMNED
NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS WROTE BROADCAST AND WITNESSES WERE QUOTED AND THIS TIME THERE IS NO MENTION OF A HOAX AND EXCEPT BY ONE SCIENTIST
BUT IN CONFORMITY WITH A GENERAL ATTEMPT TO HOLD OUT FOR ISOLATION OF THIS EARTH THIS IS ATTEMPTED POSITIVENESS WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT SCIENCE CAN NO MORE SUCCEED THAN
RECOGNIZED IT IN A MOMENT IT WAS A GELATINOUS FUNGUS HE DID NOT SATISFY HIMSELF AS TO JUST THE EXACT SPECIES IT BELONGED TO BUT HE PREDICTED THAT SIMILAR FUNGI MIGHT SPRING UP WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
AN ALGA OR IN SOME RESPECTS A FUNGOUS GROWTH THE RIVAL CONVENTION IS SPAWN OF FROGS OR OF FISHES THESE TWO CONVENTIONS HAVE MADE A STRONG COMBINATION
LEAVING A JELLY LIKE MASS ON THE GROUND WE ARE TOLD THAT THIS SUBSTANCE FELL ONLY THREE FEET AWAY FROM AN OBSERVER IN THE REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE NINETY FOUR ACCORDING TO A LETTER FROM GREG TO PROFESSOR BADEN POWELL
AS MUCH AS IT CAN EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THIS EARTH THIS BOOK IS AN ASSEMBLAGE OF DATA OF EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THIS EARTH WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT OUR DATA HAVE BEEN DAMNED UPON NO CONSIDERATION FOR INDIVIDUAL MERITS OR DEMERITS
BEFORE THE ERUPTION OCCURRED
THE ARRIVAL OF DUST FROM SOMEWHERE BEYOND THIS EARTH NOT THAT SCIENTISTS THEMSELVES HAVE EVER ACHIEVED POSITIVENESS IN ITS ASPECT OF UNITEDNESS AMONG THEMSELVES BECAUSE NORDENSKIOLD
WITH WHICH WE SHALL END UP IT WILL MEAN THAT SOMETHING HAD BEEN IN A STATIONARY POSITION FOR SEVERAL DAYS OVER A SMALL PART OF A SMALL TOWN IN ENGLAND THIS IS THE REVOLUTIONARY THING THAT WE HAVE ALLUDED TO BEFORE
OF OUTSIDE FORCES ONE MAY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF A LAVOISIER AND STILL NOT BE ABLE TO ANALYZE NOT BE ABLE EVEN TO SEE
IT IS SAID THAT THESE PHENOMENA WERE CAUSED BY PARTICLES OF VOLCANIC DUST THAT WERE CAST HIGH IN THE AIR BY KRAKATOA THIS IS THE EXPLANATION THAT WAS AGREED UPON IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE BUT FOR SEVEN YEARS THE ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA CONTINUED
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IF ANYONE WAS SO CREDULOUS AS TO THINK THAT STONES HAD EVER FALLEN FROM THE SKY HE WAS REASONED WITH IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE ARE NO STONES IN THE SKY THEREFORE NO STONES CAN FALL FROM THE SKY
MY OWN CHIEF REASON FOR INDIGNATION HERE THAT THIS PREPOSTEROUS EXPLANATION INTERFERES WITH SOME OF MY OWN ENORMITIES IT WOULD COST ME TOO MUCH EXPLAINING IF I SHOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THIS EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE
WAS NOT SO PRUDISH CHLADNI WAS NOT AND GREG WAS NOT I SHALL HAVE TO ACCEPT MYSELF THAT GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE HAS OFTEN FALLEN FROM THE SKY OR THAT
THE FALL OF A THOUSAND TONS OF BUTTER JET BLACK SNOW PINK SNOW BLUE HAILSTONES HAILSTONES FLAVORED LIKE ORANGES PUNK AND SILK AND CHARCOAL
SAYS THAT ALL OUR DATA IN THIS RESPECT MUST BE
THE FLAKE FORMATION IS INTERESTING LATER WE SHALL THINK OF IT AS SIGNIFYING PRESSURE SOMEWHERE IT WAS A THICK SHOWER ON THE GROUND ON TREES ON FENCES BUT IT WAS NARROWLY LOCALIZED
EXCEPT CONFORMABLY WITH THE HYPNOSES OR THE CONVENTIONAL REACTIONS AGAINST HYPNOSES OF ONE'S ERA WE BELIEVE NO MORE WE ACCEPT
FAR UP OR FAR AWAY THE WHOLE SKY IS GELATINOUS THAT METEORS TEAR THROUGH AND DETACH FRAGMENTS THAT FRAGMENTS ARE BROUGHT DOWN BY STORMS
SEEMS TO PARTAKE SO MUCH OF THE MARVELOUS AS ALMOST ENTIRELY TO EXCLUDE THE OPERATION OF KNOWN AND NATURAL AGENTS YET A BODY OF EVIDENCE IS HERE BROUGHT TO PROVE THAT SUCH EVENTS HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE
A MEMBER OF THE SELBORNE SOCIETY STILL ARGUED THAT METEORITES DO NOT FALL FROM THE SKY THAT THEY ARE MASSES OF IRON UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT ATTRACT LIGHTNING
SO HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT SOMETHING IS NOT SOMETHING ELSE WHEN NEITHER IS SOMETHING ELSE SOME OTHER THING THERE'S NOTHING TO PROVE THIS IS ONE OF THE PROFUNDITIES THAT WE ADVERTISED IN ADVANCE
AND FORTY PLATES SOME OF THEM MARVELOUSLY COLORED IT WAS ISSUED AFTER AN INVESTIGATION THAT TOOK FIVE YEARS YOU COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING DONE MORE EFFICIENTLY ARTISTICALLY AUTHORITATIVELY THE MATHEMATICAL PARTS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPRESSIVE
YOU CAN OPPOSE AN ABSURDITY ONLY WITH SOME OTHER ABSURDITY BUT SCIENCE IS ESTABLISHED PREPOSTEROUSNESS WE DIVIDE ALL INTELLECTION THE OBVIOUSLY PREPOSTEROUSNESS AND THE ESTABLISHED BUT KRAKATOA
MISTER JENYNS CONCEIVES OF A LARGE POOL IN WHICH WERE MANY OF THESE SPHERICAL MASSES OF THE POOL DRYING UP AND CONCENTRATING ALL IN A SMALL AREA OF A WHIRLWIND THEN SCOOPING ALL UP TOGETHER
LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHIRLWIND AND VOLCANO EXPLANATIONS HAD TO BE ABANDONED BUT SO POWERFUL WAS THIS EXCLUSION HYPNOSIS SENTENCE OF DAMNATION OR THIS ATTEMPT AT POSITIVENESS
SCIENTISTS HAVE PERPETRATED SUCH AN ENORMITY AS SUSPENSION OF VOLCANIC DUST SEVEN YEARS IN THE AIR DISREGARDING THE LAPSE OF SEVERAL YEARS
ONE OF THE MOST RESOLUTE OF THE EXCLUSIONISTS NEW YORK TIMES MARCH TWELFTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THAT THE SUBSTANCE HAD BEEN EXAMINED AND ANALYZED BY PROFESSOR SMITH ACCORDING TO WHOM IT GAVE EVERY INDICATION OF BEING THE
OCCURS THE INEVITABLE DAMNATION OF THE AMHERST OBJECT PROFESSOR EDWARD HITCHCOCK WENT TO LIVE IN AMHERST
TO SEE THE SUBSTANCE THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NOSTOC BUT HE HAD ALSO CALLED UPON DOCTOR HAMILTON WHO HAD A SPECIMEN AND DOCTOR HAMILTON HAD DECLARED IT TO BE LUNG TISSUE DOCTOR EDWARDS
AT NIGHT OCTOBER EIGHTH EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR NEAR COBLENZ A GERMAN WHO WAS KNOWN TO GREG AND ANOTHER PERSON SAW A LUMINOUS BODY FALL CLOSE TO THEM THEY RETURNED NEXT MORNING AND FOUND A GELATINOUS MASS
VISCOUS AND PUTRID
RAW MEAT SHOULD NOT BE FED TO BABIES WE SHALL HAVE A FEW DATA INITIATORILY I FEAR ME THAT THE HORSE AND THE BARN WERE A LITTLE EXTREME FOR OUR BUDDING LIBERALITIES THE OUTRAGEOUS IS THE REASONABLE
OF BATH HIS DESCRIPTION IS OF MINUTE WORMS IN FILMY ENVELOPES HE TRIES TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR SEGREGATION THE MYSTERY OF IT IS WHAT COULD HAVE BROUGHT SO MANY OF THEM TOGETHER
FOR INSTANCE THE TURTLE OF VICKSBURG
AFTER A HEAVY RAINFALL WE ARE NOT TOLD OF NOSTOC THIS TIME IT IS SAID THAT THE OBJECT CONTAINED NUMEROUS EGGS
IT'S MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS LATER
ANNUAL REGISTER
WHETHER THE SUBSTANCE WERE NOSTOC OR SPAWN OR SOME KIND OF A LARVAL NEXUS DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH IF IT STOOD IN THE SKY FOR SEVERAL DAYS WE RANK WITH MOSES AS A CHRONICLER OF IMPROPRIETIES
AS IF THIS TIME FROG SPAWN DID FALL FROM THE SKY AND MAY HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED BY A WHIRLWIND BECAUSE
NEVERTHELESS THEY WERE AS COMMON AS WERE GREEN SUNS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE SCIENCE HAD TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE UNCONVENTIONALITIES SUCH PUBLICATIONS AS NATURE AND KNOWLEDGE WERE BESIEGED WITH INQUIRIES
AND NOW WE HAVE AN OCCURRENCE THAT ATTRACTED A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION IN ITS OWN TIME USUALLY THESE THINGS OF THE ACCURSED HAVE BEEN HUSHED UP OR DISREGARDED SUPPRESSED LIKE THE SEVEN BLACK RAINS OF SLAINS BUT UPON MARCH THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX
DOCTOR A MEAD EDWARDS PRESIDENT OF THE NEWARK SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION
THE PHENOMENON WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE REMARKS BEFORE US WILL SEEM TO MOST PERSONS AS LITTLE WORTHY OF CREDIT AS ANY THAT COULD BE OFFERED THE FALLING OF LARGE STONES FROM THE SKY WITHOUT ANY ASSIGNABLE CAUSE OF THEIR PREVIOUS ASCENT
AND UNREALNESS IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO A COMMITTEE OF WHOM LAVOISIER WAS A MEMBER WAS APPOINTED BY THE FRENCH ACADEMY TO INVESTIGATE A REPORT THAT A STONE HAD FALLEN FROM THE SKY AT LUCE FRANCE
IN THE TOPOGRAPHY OF INTELLECTION I SHOULD SAY THAT WHAT WE CALL KNOWLEDGE IS IGNORANCE SURROUNDED BY LAUGHTER BLACK RAINS RED RAINS
THAT THE FALL DID TAKE PLACE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE EXCLUSIONISTS ARE STILL MORE EMPHATICALLY CONSERVATORS IT IS NOT SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE INIMICAL TO ALL DATA
A BUFF COLORED PULPY SUBSTANCE WAS FOUND
UPON MARCH THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AT OLYMPIAN SPRINGS BATH COUNTY KENTUCKY FLAKES OF A SUBSTANCE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEEF FELL FROM THE SKY FROM A CLEAR SKY WE'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT WAS SAID
OR NOTHING MORE REASONABLE OR SCIENTIFIC OR LOGICAL THAN THAT COULD BE SAID UPON ANY SUBJECT THE ONLY TROUBLE IS THE UNIVERSAL TROUBLE THAT THE MAJOR PREMISE IS NOT REAL OR IS INTERMEDIATE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN REALNESS
PLACED BEFORE THE ACADEMY SOME FRAGMENTS OF A GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE SAID TO HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY AND ASKED THAT THEY BE ANALYZED THERE IS NO FURTHER ALLUSION TO THIS SUBJECT COMPTES RENDUS
ALSO THERE WERE BLUE MOONS
OF ABOUT THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF A TWENTY FIVE CENT PIECE THAT ACCORDING TO A COMMUNICATION FROM A C TWINING TO PROFESSOR OLMSTEAD A WOMAN AT WEST POINT NEW YORK
THAT THEY WERE SEEN IN NATAL SOUTH AFRICA SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE ERUPTION INERTIA AND ITS INHOSPITALITY OR
GREEN SCIENCE GOSSIP
THAT IN WILNA LITHUANIA APRIL FOURTH EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX IN A RAINSTORM FELL NUT SIZED MASSES OF A SUBSTANCE THAT IS DESCRIBED AS BOTH RESINOUS AND GELATINOUS IT WAS ODORLESS UNTIL BURNED
IT WOULD SEEM ACCEPTABLE THAT IF MANY REPORTS OF WHITE BIRDS SHOULD OCCUR THE BIRDS ARE NOT BLACKBIRDS EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN WHITE BLACKBIRDS OR THAT IF OFTEN REPORTED
TO GIVE COMPLETENESS TO THE PROPER EXPLANATION IT IS SAID THAT MISTER BRANDEIS HAD IDENTIFIED THE SUBSTANCE AS FLESH COLORED NOSTOC PROFESSOR LAWRENCE SMITH OF KENTUCKY
IN A WHIRLWIND NOW I CAN'T SAY THAT NOSTOC IS ALWAYS GREENISH ANY MORE THAN I CAN SAY THAT BLACKBIRDS ARE ALWAYS BLACK HAVING SEEN A WHITE ONE WE SHALL QUOTE A SCIENTIST WHO KNEW OF FLESH COLORED NOSTOC WHEN
THESE DATA ARE SO IMPROPER THEY'RE OBSCENE TO THE SCIENCE OF TODAY BUT WE SHALL SEE THAT SCIENCE
HIS FEELING WAS OF CONVICTION THAT PROPRIETY HAD BEEN RE ESTABLISHED OR THAT THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN SOLVED AS HE EXPRESSES IT KNOWING MISTER BRANDEIS WELL HE HAD CALLED UPON THAT UPHOLDER OF RESPECTABILITY
THEY HAD DISGORGED PROFESSOR FASSIG LISTS THE SUBSTANCE IN HIS BIBLIOGRAPHY AS FISH SPAWN MC ATEE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
SO AUTHORITATIVELY FALLING STONES WERE DAMNED THE STOCK MEANS OF EXCLUSION REMAINED THE EXPLANATION OF LIGHTNING THAT WAS SEEN TO STRIKE SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE
THAT SEEMED TO PASS NEAR THE GROUND
IF INTRODUCED POLITELY HAILSTONES FOR INSTANCE ONE READS IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF HAILSTONES THE SIZE OF HENS EGGS ONE SMILES NEVERTHELESS I WILL ENGAGE TO LIST ONE HUNDRED INSTANCES FROM THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SO DEFINITELY IDENTIFIED AS OF A KNOWN LOCAL SPECIES OR THEY WERE NOT FISH AT ALL I INCLINE MYSELF TO THE ACCEPTANCE THAT THEY WERE NOT FISH
NEVER BOTHER TO FIGHT A THING SET ITS OWN PARTS FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER WE ARE MERGING AWAY FROM CARNAL TO GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE AND HERE THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF INSTANCES OR REPORTS OF INSTANCES
OR THE SPIRIT OR HOPE OR AMBITION OF THE COSMOS WHICH WE CALL ATTEMPTED POSITIVISM NOT TO FIND OUT THE NEW NOT TO ADD TO WHAT IS CALLED KNOWLEDGE BUT TO SYSTEMATIZE
THE NEXT DAY A JELLY LIKE MASS WAS FOUND IN THE SNOW
THEN IT SPREAD A VERY PRONOUNCED SWEETISH ODOR IT IS DESCRIBED AS LIKE GELATINE BUT MUCH FIRMER BUT HAVING BEEN IN WATER TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT SWELLED OUT
HE IS VERY SURE BUT JUST A LITTLE REDUNDANT WE SHALL BE OPPOSED BY THE STANDARD RESISTANCES THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE UP FROM ONE PLACE IN A WHIRLWIND AND DOWN IN ANOTHER
AS LATE AS NOVEMBER NINETEEN O TWO
I SUPPOSE IN ALASKA AND IN THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDS ALL THE MEDICINE MEN WERE SIMILARLY UPON TRIAL SOMETHING HAD TO BE THOUGHT OF UPON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THE VOLCANO OF KRAKATOA OF THE STRAITS OF SUNDA
WRITES OF THE SUBSTANCE THAT HAD SO COMPLETELY OR BEAUTIFULLY IF BEAUTY IS COMPLETENESS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NOSTOC IT TURNED OUT TO BE LUNG TISSUE ALSO
WHEN THE TESTIMONY WAS TOO GOOD THAT IT HAD FALLEN
BEFORE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE WROTE A GREAT DEAL UPON HIS THEORY OF COSMIC DUST AND PROFESSOR CLEVELAND ABBE CONTENDED AGAINST THE KRAKATOAN EXPLANATION BUT THAT THIS IS THE ORTHODOXY OF THE MAIN BODY OF SCIENTISTS
THAT'S THE EXPLANATION THAT THE SCIENTISTS GAVE
A FEW MINUTES OF EXPOSURE TO THE AIR CHANGED THE BUFF COLOR TO A LIVID COLOR RESEMBLING VENOUS BLOOD IT ABSORBED MOISTURE QUICKLY FROM THE AIR AND LIQUEFIED FOR SOME OF THE CHEMIC REACTIONS SEE THE JOURNAL
I FEAR ME I FEAR ME THIS IS ONE OF THE PROFOUNDLY DAMNED I BLURT OUT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD PERHAPS BE WITHHELD FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES BUT THAT DAMNED THING WAS THE SIZE OF AN ELEPHANT
IF THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD SEEM TO COMBINE AGAINST YOU IT IS ONLY UNREAL COMBINATION OR INTERMEDIATENESS TO UNITY AND DISUNITY EVERY RESISTANCE IS ITSELF DIVIDED INTO PARTS RESISTING ONE ANOTHER THE SIMPLEST STRATEGY SEEMS TO BE
IS PROFESSOR GRAVES ACCOUNT COMMUNICATED BY PROFESSOR DEWEY THAT UPON THE EVENING OF AUGUST THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN A LIGHT WAS SEEN IN AMHERST A FALLING OBJECT SOUND
LAVOISIER'S ANALYSIS ABSOLUTELY PROVED
IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE COMMON SENSE TO SAY THAT THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STATIONARY OVER THE TOWN OF BATH SEVERAL DAYS THE SEVEN BLACK RAINS OF SLAINS THE FOUR RED RAINS OF SIENA
WHILE MEN CARRYING WHIPS WENT BY THEIR SIDE AND HASTENED ON THE ROAD THOSE THAT WALKED TOO SLOWLY AS MANY AS SIXTY MEN WERE TAKEN OUT AND KILLED IN THIS WAY WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR FRIENDS IN THE BUILDING WHO FANCIED THEY WERE MERELY BEING MOVED FROM ONE PRISON TO ANOTHER
WHERE EURYLOCHUS AND HIS MEN CONFRONTED THE MESSENIANS AND DEMOSTHENES THE PELOPONNESIANS WERE NOW WELL ENGAGED AND WITH THEIR OUTFLANKING WING WERE UPON THE POINT OF TURNING THEIR ENEMY'S RIGHT
YET DWELT IN UNWALLED VILLAGES SCATTERED FAR APART AND HAD NOTHING BUT LIGHT ARMOUR AND MIGHT ACCORDING TO THE MESSENIANS BE SUBDUED WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY BEFORE SUCCOURS COULD ARRIVE THE PLAN WHICH THEY RECOMMENDED WAS TO ATTACK FIRST THE APODOTIANS NEXT THE OPHIONIANS
RETURNED IN A HUGE WAVE AND INVADED A GREAT PART OF THE TOWN AND RETREATED LEAVING SOME OF IT STILL UNDER WATER SO THAT WHAT WAS ONCE LAND IS NOW SEA SUCH OF THE INHABITANTS PERISHING AS COULD NOT RUN UP TO THE HIGHER GROUND IN TIME A SIMILAR INUNDATION ALSO OCCURRED AT ATALANTA
WHO HAD BEEN PLACED AT THE END OF THE LINE RECEIVED AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY REPULSED THE CORINTHIANS WHO THEREUPON RETREATED TO A WALL UPON THE RISING GROUND BEHIND AND THROWING DOWN THE STONES UPON THEM
ALL OF WHOM JOINED IN THE EXPEDITION THE OLPAEANS CONTENTING THEMSELVES WITH GIVING HOSTAGES WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING THE INVASION
IN FIRST DAYS OF THE NEXT SUMMER THERE WAS AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN AT THE TIME OF NEW MOON AND IN THE EARLY PART OF THE SAME MONTH AN EARTHQUAKE MEANWHILE THE MITYLENIAN AND OTHER LESBIAN EXILES SET OUT FOR THE MOST PART FROM THE CONTINENT WITH MERCENARIES HIRED IN PELOPONNESE
KNOWING NOTHING OF THE DISASTER AND FANCYING THAT THEY WERE THOSE OF THEIR OWN PARTY SOME ONE ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS SO ASTONISHED AT AND HOW MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN KILLED FANCYING IN HIS TURN THAT THIS WAS THE HERALD FROM THE TROOPS AT IDOMENE HE REPLIED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED
HIS PREPARATIONS COMPLETED EURYLOCHUS LODGED THE HOSTAGES IN KYTINIUM IN DORIS AND ADVANCED UPON NAUPACTUS THROUGH THE COUNTRY OF THE LOCRIANS
THINKING THAT THE WAR IN SICILY WOULD THUS BE THE SOONER ENDED AND ALSO WISHING TO EXERCISE THEIR NAVY ONE OF THE GENERALS PYTHODORUS WAS ACCORDINGLY SENT OUT WITH A FEW SHIPS
ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE ATHENIANS ON THE COAST OF SICILY SAILED TO LOCRIS
MEANWHILE THE ATHENIAN DEMOSTHENES WHO SINCE THE AFFAIR IN AETOLIA HAD REMAINED NEAR NAUPACTUS HAVING HAD NOTICE OF THE ARMY AND FEARING FOR THE TOWN WENT AND PERSUADED THE ACARNANIANS ALTHOUGH NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BECAUSE OF HIS DEPARTURE FROM LEUCAS TO GO TO THE RELIEF OF NAUPACTUS
IN THIS WAY HE ROUTED THEIR ARMY AS SOON AS HE ATTACKED IT SLAYING MOST OF THEM WHERE THEY WERE THE REST BREAKING AWAY IN FLIGHT OVER THE HILLS THE ROADS HOWEVER WERE ALREADY OCCUPIED AND WHILE THE AMPHILOCHIANS KNEW THEIR OWN COUNTRY THE AMBRACIOTS WERE IGNORANT OF IT AND COULD NOT TELL WHICH WAY TO TURN AND
AND WITH STRIPS MADE FROM THEIR CLOTHING ADOPTING IN SHORT EVERY POSSIBLE MEANS OF SELF DESTRUCTION
BUT WE FOUGHT WITH NO ONE YESTERDAY BUT THE DAY BEFORE IN THE RETREAT
AFTER FIRST HOWEVER OBTAINING PLEDGES FROM THE ATHENIANS AND SECURITY AS FAR AS THIS WAS POSSIBLE FOR THEIR CONTINUING TO TREAT THEM AS BEFORE THUS THE WINTER ENDED AND WITH IT ENDED THE SEVENTH YEAR OF THIS WAR OF WHICH THUCYDIDES IS THE HISTORIAN
THE ISLAND OFF THE OPUNTIAN LOCRIAN COAST CARRYING AWAY PART OF THE ATHENIAN FORT AND WRECKING ONE OF TWO SHIPS WHICH WERE DRAWN UP ON THE BEACH
TO KYTINIUM IN DORIS KEEPING PARNASSUS ON HIS RIGHT UNTIL HE DESCENDED TO THE PHOCIANS WHOM HE COULD FORCE TO JOIN HIM IF THEIR ANCIENT FRIENDSHIP FOR ATHENS DID NOT AS HE ANTICIPATED AT ONCE DECIDE THEM TO DO SO ARRIVED IN PHOCIS HE WAS ALREADY UPON THE FRONTIER OF BOEOTIA
ALL THE WOMEN TAKEN IN THE STRONGHOLD WERE SOLD AS SLAVES IN THIS WAY THE CORCYRAEANS OF THE MOUNTAIN WERE DESTROYED BY THE COMMONS AND SO AFTER TERRIBLE EXCESSES THE PARTY STRIFE CAME TO AN END
THE ACARNANIANS AND AMPHILOCHIANS AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF DEMOSTHENES AND THE ATHENIANS GRANTED THE AMBRACIOTS AND PELOPONNESIANS WHO HAD TAKEN REFUGE WITH SALYNTHIUS AND THE AGRAEANS
LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND COMMIT THEMSELVES TO THE DISCRETION OF THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE THE GENERALS CARRIED THEM ACROSS UNDER TRUCE TO THE ISLAND OF PTYCHIA
AND AFTERWARDS TAKEN OUT BY TWENTIES AND LED PAST TWO LINES OF HEAVY INFANTRY ONE ON EACH SIDE BEING BOUND TOGETHER AND BEATEN AND STABBED BY THE MEN IN THE LINES WHENEVER ANY SAW PASS A PERSONAL ENEMY
TELL ME NOT I GO OUT FROM YOUR HEARTS AND IF IN AFTER HOURS SOME OTHER WANDERER IN THIS WORLD OF OURS TOUCH AT YOUR SHORES AND ASK YOUR MAIDENS HERE WHO SINGS THE SONGS THE SWEETEST TO YOUR EAR THINK OF ME THEN AND ANSWER WITH A SMILE A BLIND OLD MAN OF SCIO'S ROCKY ISLE
THE SAME SUMMER THE AETOLIANS WHO BEFORE THE ATHENIAN EXPEDITION HAD SENT AN EMBASSY TO CORINTH AND LACEDAEMON COMPOSED OF TOLOPHUS AN OPHIONIAN
THE SAME SUMMER ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT THE ATHENIANS WERE DETAINED AT MELOS THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS IN THE THIRTY SHIPS CRUISING ROUND PELOPONNESE AFTER CUTTING OFF SOME GUARDS IN AN AMBUSH AT ELLOMENUS IN LEUCADIA SUBSEQUENTLY WENT AGAINST LEUCAS ITSELF WITH A LARGE ARMAMENT
FINDING THAT THIS FORCE HAD ENTERED AND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STORM THE TOWN WITHDREW NOT TO PELOPONNESE BUT TO THE COUNTRY ONCE CALLED AEOLIS AND NOW CALYDON AND PLEURON AND TO THE PLACES IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND PROSCHIUM IN AETOLIA
THE FIRST DAY HE TOOK POTIDANIA THE NEXT KROKYLE AND THE THIRD TICHIUM WHERE HE HALTED AND SENT BACK THE BOOTY TO EUPALIUM IN LOCRIS HAVING DETERMINED TO PURSUE HIS CONQUESTS AS FAR AS THE OPHIONIANS AND IN THE EVENT OF THEIR REFUSING TO SUBMIT
MEANWHILE PYTHODORUS HAD TAKEN THE COMMAND OF LACHES SHIPS AND TOWARDS THE END OF WINTER SAILED AGAINST THE LOCRIAN FORT WHICH LACHES HAD FORMERLY TAKEN AND RETURNED AFTER BEING DEFEATED IN BATTLE BY THE LOCRIANS IN THE FIRST DAYS OF THIS SPRING
AND AN EARTHQUAKE THREW DOWN PART OF THE WALL THE TOWN HALL AND A FEW OTHER BUILDINGS THE CAUSE IN MY OPINION OF THIS PHENOMENON MUST BE SOUGHT IN THE EARTHQUAKE AT THE POINT WHERE ITS SHOCK HAS BEEN THE MOST VIOLENT THE SEA IS DRIVEN BACK AND SUDDENLY RECOILING WITH REDOUBLED FORCE
AND BY THE ZACYNTHIANS AND CEPHALLENIANS AND FIFTEEN SHIPS FROM CORCYRA WHILE THE LEUCADIANS WITNESSED THE DEVASTATION OF THEIR LAND WITHOUT AND WITHIN THE ISTHMUS UPON WHICH THE TOWN OF LEUCAS AND THE TEMPLE OF APOLLO STAND WITHOUT MAKING ANY MOVEMENT ON ACCOUNT OF THE OVERWHELMING NUMBERS OF THE ENEMY
AND THE TOWN WOULD ALSO BE USEFUL AS A STATION ON THE ROAD TO THRACE IN SHORT EVERYTHING MADE THE LACEDAEMONIANS EAGER TO FOUND THE PLACE AFTER FIRST CONSULTING THE GOD AT DELPHI AND RECEIVING A FAVOURABLE ANSWER THEY SENT OFF THE COLONISTS SPARTANS AND PERIOECI
AND ON THEIR LEFT THE REST OF ACARNANIA
SUMMER WAS NOW OVER THE WINTER FOLLOWING THE PLAGUE A SECOND TIME ATTACKED THE ATHENIANS FOR ALTHOUGH IT HAD NEVER ENTIRELY LEFT THEM STILL THERE HAD BEEN A NOTABLE ABATEMENT IN ITS RAVAGES
THE BATTLE DID NOT END UNTIL THE EVENING THE NEXT DAY MENEDAIUS WHO ON THE DEATH OF EURYLOCHUS AND MACARIUS HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE SOLE COMMAND BEING AT A LOSS AFTER SO SIGNAL A DEFEAT HOW TO STAY AND SUSTAIN A SIEGE
THE BOMIENSIANS AND CALLIENSIANS WHO EXTEND TOWARDS THE MALIAN GULF BEING AMONG THE NUMBER THE MESSENIANS HOWEVER ADHERED TO THEIR ORIGINAL ADVICE ASSURING DEMOSTHENES THAT THE AETOLIANS WERE AN EASY CONQUEST THEY URGED HIM TO PUSH ON AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE
CAUSES THE INUNDATION WITHOUT AN EARTHQUAKE I DO NOT SEE HOW SUCH AN ACCIDENT COULD HAPPEN DURING THE SAME SUMMER DIFFERENT OPERATIONS WERE CARRIED ON BY THE DIFFERENT BELLIGERENTS IN SICILY BY THE SICELIOTS THEMSELVES AGAINST EACH OTHER AND BY THE ATHENIANS AND THEIR ALLIES
DEMOSTHENES LED THEM NEAR TO OLPAE AND ENCAMPED A GREAT RAVINE SEPARATING THE TWO ARMIES DURING FIVE DAYS THEY REMAINED INACTIVE ON THE SIXTH BOTH SIDES FORMED IN ORDER OF BATTLE THE ARMY OF THE PELOPONNESIANS WAS THE LARGEST AND OUTFLANKED THEIR OPPONENTS
AFTER CELEBRATING THE DELIAN DANCE OF THE WOMEN HE ENDS HIS SONG OF PRAISE WITH THESE VERSES IN WHICH HE ALSO ALLUDES TO HIMSELF WELL MAY APOLLO KEEP YOU ALL AND SO SWEETHEARTS GOOD BYE YET
THESE REPRESENTATIONS SUCCEEDING IT WAS SO ARRANGED THAT THE MEN WERE CAUGHT SAILING OUT IN THE BOAT THAT WAS PROVIDED AND THE TREATY BECAME VOID ACCORDINGLY
WHEN THE ACARNANIANS FROM THE AMBUSCADE SET UPON THEM FROM BEHIND AND BROKE THEM AT THE FIRST ATTACK WITHOUT THEIR STAYING TO RESIST
THE NEWLY FOUNDED CITY IN TRACHIS UNDER THE COMMAND OF EURYLOCHUS A SPARTAN ACCOMPANIED BY MACARIUS AND MENEDAIUS ALSO SPARTANS THE ARMY HAVING ASSEMBLED AT DELPHI EURYLOCHUS SENT A HERALD TO THE OZOLIAN LOCRIANS THE ROAD TO NAUPACTUS LYING THROUGH THEIR TERRITORY
AND BELIEVING THAT THEY WERE BEING BETRAYED EVEN THREW A DART OR TWO AT SOME OF THEIR GENERALS WHO TRIED TO STOP THEM AND TOLD THEM THAT LEAVE HAD BEEN GIVEN EVENTUALLY HOWEVER THEY LET PASS THE MANTINEANS AND PELOPONNESIANS AND SLEW ONLY THE AMBRACIOTS THERE BEING MUCH DISPUTE AND DIFFICULTY IN DISTINGUISHING WHETHER A MAN WAS AN AMBRACIOT OR A PELOPONNESIAN
CELEBRATED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE QUINQUENNIAL FESTIVAL OF THE DELIAN GAMES ONCE UPON A TIME INDEED THERE WAS A GREAT ASSEMBLAGE OF THE IONIANS AND THE NEIGHBOURING ISLANDERS AT DELOS
AFTER BIVOUACKING WITH THE ARMY IN THE PRECINCT OF NEMEAN ZEUS IN WHICH THE POET HESIOD IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE COUNTRY ACCORDING TO AN ORACLE WHICH HAD FORETOLD THAT HE SHOULD DIE IN NEMEA DEMOSTHENES SET OUT AT DAYBREAK TO INVADE AETOLIA
TYRANT OF SAMOS HAVING ADDED RHENEA TO HIS OTHER ISLAND CONQUESTS DURING HIS PERIOD OF NAVAL ASCENDANCY DEDICATED IT TO THE DELIAN APOLLO BY BINDING IT TO DELOS WITH A CHAIN THE ATHENIANS AFTER THE PURIFICATION
MEANWHILE THE ATHENIANS TOOK UP THEIR DEAD UNDER TRUCE FROM THE AETOLIANS AND RETIRED TO NAUPACTUS AND FROM THENCE WENT IN THEIR SHIPS TO ATHENS DEMOSTHENES STAYING BEHIND IN NAUPACTUS AND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BEING AFRAID TO FACE THE ATHENIANS AFTER THE DISASTER
AND THUS THOUGHT SECURE OF PROSPERITY ON THE OTHER HAND THE LACEDAEMONIANS THEMSELVES IN THE PERSONS OF THEIR GOVERNORS DID THEIR FULL SHARE TOWARDS RUINING ITS PROSPERITY AND REDUCING ITS POPULATION AS THEY FRIGHTENED AWAY THE GREATER PART OF THE INHABITANTS BY GOVERNING HARSHLY AND IN SOME CASES NOT FAIRLY
TO ASK LEAVE TO TAKE UP THE DEAD THAT HAD FALLEN AFTER THE FIRST ENGAGEMENT WHEN THEY LEFT THE CAMP WITH THE MANTINEANS AND THEIR COMPANIONS WITHOUT LIKE THEM HAVING HAD PERMISSION TO DO SO AT THE SIGHT OF THE ARMS OF THE AMBRACIOTS FROM THE CITY THE HERALD WAS ASTONISHED AT THEIR NUMBER
THEY ACCORDINGLY SENT WITH HIM ON BOARD HIS SHIPS A THOUSAND HEAVY INFANTRY WHO THREW THEMSELVES INTO THE PLACE AND SAVED IT THE EXTENT OF ITS WALL AND THE SMALL NUMBER OF ITS DEFENDERS OTHERWISE PLACING IT IN THE GREATEST DANGER MEANWHILE EURYLOCHUS AND HIS COMPANIONS
WHO HAD CROSSED OVER AS I HAVE MENTIONED AFTER THE REVOLUTION AND BECOME MASTERS OF THE COUNTRY TO THE GREAT HURT OF THE INHABITANTS THEIR STRONGHOLD HAVING BEEN TAKEN BY AN ATTACK THE GARRISON TOOK REFUGE IN A BODY UPON SOME HIGH GROUND AND THERE CAPITULATED AGREEING TO GIVE UP THEIR MERCENARY AUXILIARIES
LYCOPHRON THEIR GENERAL BEING AMONG THE NUMBER THE REST OF THE ARMY BROKEN AND PUT TO FLIGHT IN THIS WAY WITHOUT BEING SERIOUSLY PURSUED OR HURRIED RETIRED TO THE HIGH GROUND AND THERE TOOK UP ITS POSITION THE ATHENIANS FINDING THAT THE ENEMY NO LONGER OFFERED TO ENGAGE THEM
AND THE OTHER COMMANDERS AND PRINCIPAL MEN OF THE PELOPONNESIANS BY DEMOSTHENES AND HIS ACARNANIAN COLLEAGUES WHO DESIRED TO STRIP THE AMBRACIOTS AND THE MERCENARY HOST OF FOREIGNERS OF THEIR SUPPORTERS AND ABOVE ALL TO DISCREDIT THE LACEDAEMONIANS AND PELOPONNESIANS WITH THE HELLENES IN THOSE PARTS
RETURNING FROM THE PURSUIT THEY FOUND THEIR MAIN BODY DEFEATED AND HARD PRESSED BY THE ACARNANIANS WITH DIFFICULTY MADE GOOD THEIR PASSAGE TO OLPAE SUFFERING HEAVY LOSS ON THE WAY AS THEY DASHED ON WITHOUT DISCIPLINE OR ORDER
IN LATER TIMES ALTHOUGH THE ISLANDERS AND THE ATHENIANS CONTINUED TO SEND THE CHOIRS OF DANCERS WITH SACRIFICES THE CONTESTS AND MOST OF THE CEREMONIES WERE ABOLISHED PROBABLY THROUGH ADVERSITY UNTIL THE ATHENIANS CELEBRATED THE GAMES UPON THIS OCCASION WITH THE NOVELTY OF HORSE RACES
INVOKE THY FAVOUR ON EACH MANLY GAME AND DANCE AND SING IN HONOUR OF THY NAME THAT THERE WAS ALSO A POETICAL CONTEST IN WHICH THE IONIANS WENT TO CONTEND AGAIN IS SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING TAKEN FROM THE SAME HYMN
AGREEABLY TO A CONCERTED SIGNAL UNDER THE COMMAND OF HIPPONICUS SON OF CALLIAS AND EURYMEDON SON OF THUCLES THEY ENCAMPED AND PASSING THAT DAY IN RAVAGING THE TANAGRAEAN TERRITORY REMAINED THERE FOR THE NIGHT AND NEXT DAY AFTER DEFEATING THOSE OF THE TANAGRAEANS WHO SAILED OUT AGAINST THEM
IN THIS EMBASSY JOINED ALSO THE DORIANS FROM THE MOTHER COUNTRY OF THE LACEDAEMONIANS WITH THE SAME REQUEST AS THEY THEMSELVES ALSO SUFFERED FROM THE SAME ENEMY AFTER HEARING THEM THE LACEDAEMONIANS DETERMINED TO SEND OUT THE COLONY WISHING TO ASSIST THE TRACHINIANS AND DORIANS
HIMSELF WITH HALF HIS FORCE MAKING FOR THE PASS AND THE REMAINDER GOING BY THE AMPHILOCHIAN HILLS AT DAWN HE FELL UPON THE AMBRACIOTS WHILE THEY WERE STILL ABED IGNORANT OF WHAT HAD PASSED AND FULLY THINKING THAT IT WAS THEIR OWN COUNTRYMEN
MEANWHILE THE REST OF THE ARMY ON EITHER SIDE FOUGHT ON TENACIOUSLY ESPECIALLY THE RIGHT WING OF THE CORINTHIANS WHERE LYCOPHRON SUSTAINED THE ATTACK OF THE ATHENIAN LEFT WHICH IT WAS FEARED MIGHT ATTEMPT THE VILLAGE OF SOLYGIA AFTER HOLDING ON FOR A LONG WHILE WITHOUT EITHER GIVING WAY
WISHING TO REDUCE THE MELIANS WHO ALTHOUGH ISLANDERS REFUSED TO BE SUBJECTS OF ATHENS OR EVEN TO JOIN HER CONFEDERACY THE DEVASTATION OF THEIR LAND NOT PROCURING THEIR SUBMISSION
THE ALLIES IN SICILY HAD SAILED TO ATHENS AND INDUCED THE ATHENIANS TO SEND OUT MORE VESSELS TO THEIR ASSISTANCE POINTING OUT THAT THE SYRACUSANS WHO ALREADY COMMANDED THEIR LAND WERE MAKING EFFORTS TO GET TOGETHER A NAVY TO AVOID BEING ANY LONGER EXCLUDED FROM THE SEA BY A FEW VESSELS
IN THE RETREAT THE ALLIES RETREATING AFTER THE ATHENIANS WERE ATTACKED BY THE SYRACUSANS FROM THE FORT AND A LARGE PART OF THEIR ARMY ROUTED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER AFTER THIS LACHES AND THE ATHENIANS FROM THE SHIPS MADE SOME DESCENTS IN LOCRIS AND DEFEATING THE LOCRIANS WHO CAME AGAINST THEM WITH PROXENUS
THREW DOWN THE TILES AND LET FLY ARROWS AT THEM FROM WHICH THE PRISONERS SHELTERED THEMSELVES AS WELL AS THEY COULD MOST OF THEIR NUMBER MEANWHILE WERE ENGAGED IN DISPATCHING THEMSELVES BY THRUSTING INTO THEIR THROATS THE ARROWS SHOT BY THE ENEMY AND HANGING THEMSELVES WITH THE CORDS TAKEN FROM SOME BEDS THAT HAPPENED TO BE THERE
NOT INDEED THE WHOLE ISLAND BUT AS MUCH OF IT AS COULD BE SEEN FROM THE TEMPLE ALL OF IT WAS HOWEVER NOW PURIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING WAY
AND PLENTY OF OTHER SUPPLIES AND MIGHT FROM THIS BASE EASILY RAVAGE LESBOS WHICH WAS NOT FAR OFF AND MAKE THEMSELVES MASTERS OF THE AEOLIAN TOWNS ON THE CONTINENT
SET OUT FROM PROSCHIUM WITH ALL HASTE TO JOIN THEM AND CROSSING THE ACHELOUS ADVANCED THROUGH ACARNANIA WHICH THEY FOUND DESERTED BY ITS POPULATION WHO HAD GONE TO THE RELIEF OF ARGOS
WITH THEIR HELLENIC ALLIES AND SUCH OF THE SICEL SUBJECTS OR ALLIES OF SYRACUSE AS HAD REVOLTED FROM HER AND JOINED THEIR ARMY MARCHED AGAINST THE SICEL TOWN INESSA THE ACROPOLIS OF WHICH WAS HELD BY THE SYRACUSANS AND AFTER ATTACKING IT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO TAKE IT RETIRED
A GARRISON OF HEAVY INFANTRY WAS ALSO REGULARLY SENT THERE AND GREAT ATTENTION PAID TO THE ISLAND AS IT WAS THE LANDING PLACE FOR THE MERCHANTMEN FROM EGYPT AND LIBYA AND AT THE SAME TIME SECURED LACONIA FROM THE ATTACKS OF PRIVATEERS FROM THE SEA
AND GOING ON BOARD CROSSED OVER TO THE ISLANDS OPPOSITE AND FROM THENCE SENT A HERALD AND TOOK UP UNDER TRUCE THE BODIES WHICH THEY HAD LEFT BEHIND TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE CORINTHIANS FELL IN THE BATTLE AND RATHER LESS THAN FIFTY ATHENIANS
WERE AGAIN ENGAGED AT CLOSE QUARTERS AT THIS MOMENT A CORINTHIAN COMPANY HAVING COME TO THE RELIEF OF THE LEFT WING ROUTED AND PURSUED THE ATHENIAN RIGHT TO THE SEA
AND THE ACARNANIANS THEMSELVES SENDING SETTLERS FROM ALL PARTS OF ACARNANIA OCCUPIED THE PLACE SUMMER WAS NOW OVER
WHEN BOTH SIDES WERE READY THEY JOINED BATTLE DEMOSTHENES BEING ON THE RIGHT WING WITH THE MESSENIANS AND A FEW ATHENIANS WHILE THE REST OF THE LINE WAS MADE UP OF THE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS OF THE ACARNANIANS
THE AMBRACIOTS HAVING COME AND URGED THEM TO COMBINE WITH THEM IN ATTACKING AMPHILOCHIAN ARGOS AND THE REST OF AMPHILOCHIA AND ACARNANIA AFFIRMING THAT THE CONQUEST OF THESE COUNTRIES WOULD BRING ALL THE CONTINENT INTO ALLIANCE WITH LACEDAEMON
THE ACARNANIANS URGED DEMOSTHENES THE ATHENIAN GENERAL TO BUILD A WALL SO AS TO CUT OFF THE TOWN FROM THE CONTINENT A MEASURE WHICH THEY WERE CONVINCED WOULD SECURE ITS CAPTURE AND RID THEM ONCE AND FOR ALL OF A MOST TROUBLESOME ENEMY
E UNITING HERE AT DAYBREAK THEY SAT DOWN AT THE PLACE CALLED METROPOLIS AND ENCAMPED
SOME EVEN TURNED TO THE SEA WHICH WAS NOT FAR OFF AND SEEING THE ATHENIAN SHIPS COASTING ALONGSHORE JUST WHILE THE ACTION WAS GOING ON SWAM OFF TO THEM THINKING IT BETTER IN THE PANIC THEY WERE IN TO PERISH IF PERISH THEY MUST BY THE HANDS OF THE ATHENIANS
WHICH HAD JUST LANDED IN FRONT OF CHERSONESE AND AFTERWARDS THE REST OF THE ARMY THE BATTLE WAS AN OBSTINATE ONE AND FOUGHT THROUGHOUT HAND TO HAND THE RIGHT WING OF THE ATHENIANS AND CARYSTIANS
PARTICULARLY AT ORCHOMENUS IN THE LAST NAMED COUNTRY
IN HIERA THE PEOPLE IN THOSE PARTS BELIEVE THAT HEPHAESTUS HAS HIS FORGE FROM THE QUANTITY OF FLAME WHICH THEY SEE IT SEND OUT BY NIGHT AND OF SMOKE BY DAY THESE ISLANDS LIE OFF THE COAST OF THE SICELS AND MESSINESE AND WERE ALLIES OF THE SYRACUSANS
INDEED THE ATHENIAN ARMY FELL VICTIMS TO DEATH IN EVERY FORM AND SUFFERED ALL THE VICISSITUDES OF FLIGHT
NIGHT CAME ON WHILE THESE HORRORS WERE ENACTING AND MOST OF IT HAD PASSED BEFORE THEY WERE CONCLUDED
AND AFTER THESE THE EURYTANIANS WHO ARE THE LARGEST TRIBE IN AETOLIA AND SPEAK AS IS SAID A LANGUAGE EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AND EAT THEIR FLESH RAW THESE ONCE SUBDUED THE REST WOULD EASILY COME IN
AND NOTHING DISTRESSED THE ATHENIANS AND REDUCED THEIR POWER MORE THAN THIS NO LESS THAN FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY IN THE RANKS DIED OF IT AND THREE HUNDRED CAVALRY BESIDES A NUMBER OF THE MULTITUDE THAT WAS NEVER ASCERTAINED
THE NUMBER THUS SLAIN WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THE REST ESCAPED INTO THE BORDERING TERRITORY OF AGRAEA AND FOUND REFUGE WITH SALYNTHIUS THE FRIENDLY KING OF THE AGRAEANS MEANWHILE THE AMBRACIOTS FROM THE CITY ARRIVED AT IDOMENE
WHEN THE HERALD HEARD THIS AND KNEW THAT THE REINFORCEMENT FROM THE CITY HAD BEEN DESTROYED HE BROKE INTO WAILING AND STUNNED AT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PRESENT EVILS WENT AWAY AT ONCE WITHOUT HAVING PERFORMED HIS ERRAND OR AGAIN ASKING FOR THE DEAD BODIES
WHILE THEY ALSO SENT FOR DEMOSTHENES THE COMMANDER OF THE AETOLIAN EXPEDITION TO BE THEIR LEADER AND FOR THE TWENTY ATHENIAN SHIPS THAT WERE CRUISING OFF PELOPONNESE UNDER THE COMMAND OF ARISTOTLE SON OF TIMOCRATES AND HIEROPHON SON OF ANTIMNESTUS
AT LAST HOWEVER SOMEONE OPENED THEIR EYES TO THE TRUTH UPON WHICH THEY CALLED UPON THE ATHENIANS TO KILL THEM THEMSELVES IF SUCH WAS THEIR PLEASURE AND REFUSED ANY LONGER TO GO OUT OF THE BUILDING AND SAID THEY WOULD DO ALL THEY COULD TO PREVENT ANY ONE COMING IN
THE NEXT SUMMER THE PELOPONNESIANS AND THEIR ALLIES SET OUT TO INVADE ATTICA UNDER THE COMMAND OF AGIS SON OF ARCHIDAMUS AND WENT AS FAR AS THE ISTHMUS BUT NUMEROUS EARTHQUAKES OCCURRING TURNED BACK AGAIN WITHOUT THE INVASION TAKING PLACE
THE SETTLEMENT EFFECTED THEY FORTIFIED ANEW THE CITY NOW CALLED HERACLEA DISTANT ABOUT FOUR MILES AND A HALF FROM THERMOPYLAE AND TWO MILES AND A QUARTER FROM THE SEA AND COMMENCED BUILDING DOCKS CLOSING THE SIDE TOWARDS THERMOPYLAE JUST BY THE PASS ITSELF IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT BE EASILY DEFENDED
FIRST THEIR NEIGHBOURS THE MYONIANS WHO HELD THE MOST DIFFICULT OF THE PASSES
AND DESCENDED INTO THE ARGIVE TERRITORY AFTER NIGHTFALL AND PASSING BETWEEN THE CITY OF ARGOS AND THE ACARNANIAN POSTS AT CRENAE
THE ACARNANIANS AND A FEW OF THE AMPHILOCHIANS MOST OF WHOM WERE KEPT BACK BY FORCE BY THE AMBRACIOTS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT ARGOS AND WERE PREPARING TO GIVE BATTLE TO THE ENEMY HAVING CHOSEN DEMOSTHENES TO COMMAND THE WHOLE OF THE ALLIED ARMY IN CONCERT WITH THEIR OWN GENERALS
OBTAINED THAT AN ARMY SHOULD BE SENT THEM AGAINST NAUPACTUS WHICH HAD INVITED THE ATHENIAN INVASION THE LACEDAEMONIANS ACCORDINGLY SENT OFF TOWARDS AUTUMN THREE THOUSAND HEAVY INFANTRY OF THE ALLIES FIVE HUNDRED OF WHOM WERE FROM HERACLEA
AT FIRST CAUSED SOME ALARM AT ATHENS WHICH THE EVENT HOWEVER DID NOTHING TO JUSTIFY THE TOWN NEVER GIVING THEM ANY TROUBLE THE REASON OF THIS WAS AS FOLLOWS
AS TRAITORS AND SELF SEEKERS WHILE THE ENEMY WAS TAKING UP HIS DEAD AND HASTILY BURYING THEM AS HE COULD AND THOSE WHO OBTAINED PERMISSION WERE SECRETLY PLANNING THEIR RETREAT WORD WAS BROUGHT TO DEMOSTHENES AND THE ACARNANIANS THAT THE AMBRACIOTS FROM THE CITY
THAN BY THOSE OF THE BARBAROUS AND DETESTED AMPHILOCHIANS OF THE LARGE AMBRACIOT FORCE DESTROYED IN THIS MANNER A FEW ONLY REACHED THE CITY IN SAFETY WHILE THE ACARNANIANS AFTER STRIPPING THE DEAD AND SETTING UP A TROPHY RETURNED TO ARGOS
THE AMBRACIOTS AND SUCH OF THE REST AS HAD ACCOMPANIED THEM IN LARGER PARTIES SEEING THEM GOING ON PUSHED ON IN THEIR TURN AND BEGAN RUNNING IN ORDER TO CATCH THEM UP THE ACARNANIANS AT FIRST THOUGHT THAT ALL ALIKE WERE DEPARTING WITHOUT PERMISSION AND BEGAN TO PURSUE THE PELOPONNESIANS
WHICH THE ACARNANIANS SET APART FOR DEMOSTHENES AND WHICH HE BROUGHT TO ATHENS IN PERSON HIS RETURN TO HIS COUNTRY AFTER THE AETOLIAN DISASTER BEING RENDERED LESS HAZARDOUS BY THIS EXPLOIT THE ATHENIANS IN THE TWENTY SHIPS ALSO WENT OFF TO NAUPACTUS
RUNNING DOWN FROM THE HILLS ON EVERY SIDE AND DARTING THEIR JAVELINS FALLING BACK WHEN THE ATHENIAN ARMY ADVANCED AND COMING ON AS IT RETIRED AND FOR A LONG WHILE THE BATTLE WAS OF THIS CHARACTER ALTERNATE ADVANCE AND RETREAT IN BOTH WHICH OPERATIONS THE ATHENIANS HAD THE WORST
AND ENTERED A FRIENDLY COUNTRY THAT OF THE AGRAEANS
INDEED THIS WAS BY FAR THE GREATEST DISASTER THAT BEFELL ANY ONE HELLENIC CITY IN AN EQUAL NUMBER OF DAYS DURING THIS WAR
THE STREAM OF FIRE ISSUED FROM ETNA AS ON FORMER OCCASIONS AND DESTROYED SOME LAND OF THE CATANIANS WHO LIVE UPON MOUNT ETNA WHICH IS THE LARGEST MOUNTAIN IN SICILY FIFTY YEARS IT IS SAID HAD ELAPSED SINCE THE LAST ERUPTION THERE HAVING BEEN THREE IN ALL SINCE THE HELLENES HAVE INHABITED SICILY
A CNIDIAN COLONY WHO LIVE IN ONE OF THEM OF NO GREAT SIZE CALLED LIPARA AND FROM THIS AS THEIR HEADQUARTERS CULTIVATE THE REST
THEIR PLAN BEING TO FREE ANTANDRUS AND THE REST OF THE ACTAEAN TOWNS FORMERLY OWNED BY MITYLENE BUT NOW HELD BY THE ATHENIANS ONCE FORTIFIED THERE THEY WOULD HAVE EVERY FACILITY FOR SHIP BUILDING FROM THE VICINITY OF IDA AND THE CONSEQUENT ABUNDANCE OF TIMBER
WHO HEARD THERE OF THE DEATH OF KING ARTAXERXES SON OF XERXES WHICH TOOK PLACE ABOUT THAT TIME AND SO RETURNED HOME THE SAME WINTER THE CHIANS PULLED DOWN THEIR NEW WALL AT THE COMMAND OF THE ATHENIANS
SON OF CAPATON UPON THE RIVER CAICINUS TOOK SOME ARMS AND DEPARTED
AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THAT THE PROPOSED TOWN WOULD LIE CONVENIENTLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE WAR AGAINST THE ATHENIANS
THAT IT WAS A FINE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM HAVING SO LARGE AN ARMY ASSEMBLED TO ATTACK THE AETOLIANS WHO WERE NOT ONLY THE ENEMIES OF NAUPACTUS BUT WHOSE REDUCTION WOULD FURTHER MAKE IT EASY TO GAIN THE REST OF THAT PART OF THE CONTINENT FOR THE ATHENIANS THE AETOLIAN NATION ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS AND WARLIKE
AND WITH THE REST OF THEIR FORCES LANDING ON THE SIDE OF THE ISLAND LOOKING TOWARDS MALEA WENT AGAINST THE LOWER TOWN OF CYTHERA WHERE THEY FOUND ALL THE INHABITANTS ENCAMPED
WERE AFRAID THAT IT MIGHT PROVE A VERY POWERFUL NEIGHBOUR AND ACCORDINGLY CONTINUALLY HARASSED AND MADE WAR UPON THE NEW SETTLERS UNTIL THEY AT LAST WORE THEM OUT IN SPITE OF THEIR ORIGINALLY CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS PEOPLE FLOCKING FROM ALL QUARTERS TO A PLACE FOUNDED BY THE LACEDAEMONIANS
IN THE MEANTIME THE MANTINEANS AND OTHERS INCLUDED IN THE AGREEMENT WENT OUT UNDER THE PRETENCE OF GATHERING HERBS AND FIREWOOD AND STOLE OFF BY TWOS AND THREES PICKING ON THE WAY THE THINGS WHICH THEY PROFESSED TO HAVE COME OUT FOR
WHILE THESE WERE THE SCHEMES OF THE EXILES THE ATHENIANS IN THE SAME SUMMER MADE AN EXPEDITION WITH SIXTY SHIPS TWO THOUSAND HEAVY INFANTRY A FEW CAVALRY AND SOME ALLIED TROOPS FROM MILETUS AND OTHER PARTS AGAINST CYTHERA
AS OF THE MANY AMBASSADORS THEY HAD SENT HIM NO TWO EVER TOLD THE SAME STORY IF HOWEVER THEY WERE PREPARED TO SPEAK PLAINLY THEY MIGHT SEND HIM SOME ENVOYS WITH THIS PERSIAN THE ATHENIANS AFTERWARDS SENT BACK ARTAPHERNES IN A GALLEY TO EPHESUS AND AMBASSADORS WITH HIM
AFTER THIS THE ACARNANIANS ALLOTTED A THIRD OF THE SPOILS TO THE ATHENIANS AND DIVIDED THE REST AMONG THEIR OWN DIFFERENT TOWNS THE SHARE OF THE ATHENIANS WAS CAPTURED ON THE VOYAGE HOME THE ARMS NOW DEPOSITED IN THE ATTIC TEMPLES ARE THREE HUNDRED PANOPLIES
AND AUTOCLES SON OF TOLMAEUS CYTHERA IS AN ISLAND LYING OFF LACONIA OPPOSITE MALEA THE INHABITANTS ARE LACEDAEMONIANS OF THE CLASS OF THE PERIOECI AND AN OFFICER CALLED THE JUDGE OF CYTHERA WENT OVER TO THE PLACE ANNUALLY FROM SPARTA
THE LAST OF THESE HAVING SUFFERED SEVERELY IN A WAR WITH THEIR NEIGHBOURS THE OETAEANS AT FIRST INTENDED TO GIVE THEMSELVES UP TO ATHENS BUT AFTERWARDS FEARING NOT TO FIND IN HER THE SECURITY THAT THEY SOUGHT SENT TO LACEDAEMON HAVING CHOSEN TISAMENUS FOR THEIR AMBASSADOR
FOR OF ONE PARTY THERE WAS PRACTICALLY NOTHING LEFT MEANWHILE THE ATHENIANS SAILED OFF TO SICILY THEIR PRIMARY DESTINATION AND CARRIED ON THE WAR WITH THEIR ALLIES THERE
THE AMBRACIOTS COULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO MARCH WITH THE ACARNANIANS AGAINST THE PELOPONNESIANS NOR THE ACARNANIANS WITH THE AMBRACIOTS AGAINST THE ATHENIANS FOR THE REST THE AMBRACIOTS WERE TO GIVE UP THE PLACES AND HOSTAGES THAT THEY HELD OF THE AMPHILOCHIANS
AND GAVE HOSTAGES AND ALL OTHER SECURITIES REQUIRED THE SAME SUMMER THE ATHENIANS SENT THIRTY SHIPS ROUND PELOPONNESE UNDER DEMOSTHENES
THEY ADVANCED THROUGH PHYTIA NEXT SKIRTING MEDEON
AND OTHERS LEVIED ON THE SPOT AND TOOK RHOETEUM BUT RESTORED IT WITHOUT INJURY ON THE RECEIPT OF TWO THOUSAND PHOCAEAN STATERS
HALIAE AND EPIDAURUS AFTER WALLING OFF THIS SPOT THE FLEET SAILED OFF HOME
THE DEAD THEY GAVE BACK TO HIM AND SETTING UP A TROPHY TOOK UP THEIR OWN ALSO TO THE NUMBER OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THE RETREAT DEMANDED THEY REFUSED PUBLICLY TO THE ARMY BUT PERMISSION TO DEPART WITHOUT DELAY WAS SECRETLY GRANTED TO THE MANTINEANS AND TO MENEDAIUS
SON OF EUTHYCLES WHO REACHED THEIR DESTINATION AFTER A DIFFICULT JOURNEY ACROSS THE CONTINENT SUCH WAS THE HISTORY OF THE AFFAIR OF AMBRACIA THE SAME WINTER THE ATHENIANS IN SICILY MADE A DESCENT FROM THEIR SHIPS UPON THE TERRITORY OF HIMERA
INVITING ALSO ANY OF THE REST OF THE HELLENES WHO MIGHT WISH TO ACCOMPANY THEM EXCEPT IONIANS ACHAEANS AND CERTAIN OTHER NATIONALITIES THREE LACEDAEMONIANS LEADING AS FOUNDERS OF THE COLONY LEON ALCIDAS AND DAMAGON
AND THEY WERE THERE IN FULL FORCE WATCHING FOR THE ATHENIANS TO LAND THESE LAST HOWEVER GAVE THEM THE SLIP BY COMING IN THE DARK AND BEING INFORMED BY SIGNALS OF THE FACT THE CORINTHIANS LEFT HALF THEIR NUMBER AT CENCHREAE IN CASE THE ATHENIANS SHOULD GO AGAINST CROMMYON
AND WITH THE REST ENCAMPED IN AMPHILOCHIA AT THE PLACE CALLED CRENAE OR THE WELLS TO WATCH FOR EURYLOCHUS AND HIS PELOPONNESIANS AND TO PREVENT THEIR PASSING THROUGH AND EFFECTING THEIR JUNCTION WITH THE AMBRACIOTS
IN ANY CASE I KNOW THAT IF THE ACARNANIANS AND AMPHILOCHIANS HAD WISHED TO TAKE AMBRACIA AS THE ATHENIANS AND DEMOSTHENES ADVISED THEY WOULD HAVE DONE SO WITHOUT A BLOW AS IT WAS THEY FEARED THAT IF THE ATHENIANS HAD IT THEY WOULD BE WORSE NEIGHBOURS TO THEM THAN THE PRESENT
AND PRODUCES A SOFT DULCET SOUND WHICH IS VARIED BY THE FINGERS RUNNING AT RANDOM OVER THE STOPS THIS IS A FAVOURITE RECREATION WITH THE FEMALES AND ONE IN WHICH FAYAWAY GREATLY EXCELLED AWKWARD AS SUCH AN INSTRUMENT MAY APPEAR
IT WAS IN FAYAWAY'S DELICATE LITTLE HANDS ONE OF THE MOST GRACEFUL I HAVE EVER SEEN A YOUNG LADY IN THE ACT OF TORMENTING A GUITAR STRUNG ABOUT HER NECK BY A COUPLE OF YARDS OF BLUE RIBBON IS NOT HALF SO ENGAGING
BUT I WAS NOW PROMOTED TO THE PLACE OF COURT MINSTREL IN WHICH CAPACITY I WAS AFTERWARDS PERPETUALLY CALLED UPON TO OFFICIATE BESIDES THE STICKS AND THE DRUMS
GLOOMILY PONDERING OVER THE FATE WHICH IT APPEARED NOW IDLE FOR ME TO RESIST WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE LOVED FRIENDS WHO WERE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM THE SAVAGE ISLAND IN WHICH I WAS HELD A CAPTIVE
TO THE GRATIFICATION OF MY PALATE THEY PAID THE MOST UNWEARIED ATTENTION THEY CONTINUALLY INVITED ME TO PARTAKE OF FOOD
AND WHEN OPENED THEY ARE FOUND TO BE ABOUT TWO THIRDS FULL OF AN OINTMENT OF A LIGHT YELLOW COLOUR AND DIFFUSING THE SWEETEST PERFUME THIS ELEGANT LITTLE ODOROUS GLOBE WOULD NOT BE OUT OF PLACE EVEN UPON THE TOILETTE OF A QUEEN
WHEN ANY OF THE INMATES CHOSE TO GO OUTSIDE THE NOISE OCCASIONED BY THE REMOVING OF THIS RUDE DOOR AWAKENED EVERY BODY ELSE AND ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION I HAD REMARKED THAT THE ISLANDERS WERE NEARLY AS IRRITABLE AS MORE CIVILIZED BEINGS UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
HIS NATIVE VALLEY AND THAT HE INTENDED TO RETURN TO IT THE SAME DAY AT ONCE IT STRUCK ME THAT COULD I BUT REACH THAT VALLEY UNDER HIS PROTECTION I MIGHT EASILY FROM THENCE REACH NUKUHEVA BY WATER AND ANIMATED BY THE PROSPECT WHICH THIS PLAN HELD OUT
WITH A FORCE AND RAPIDITY WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING ALTHOUGH THESE SAVAGES ARE REMARKABLY FOND OF CHANTING STILL THEY APPEAR TO HAVE NO IDEA WHATEVER OF SINGING
WHILE ONE PERSON IS PERFORMING THIS OPERATION ANOTHER TAKES A RIPE COCOANUT
THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE GATHERED TOGETHER ON THE MATS
TO SAVAGES GENERALLY IS IMPUTED A GUTTURAL ARTICULATION THIS HOWEVER IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE ESPECIALLY AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF THE POLYNESIAN ARCHIPELAGO
TO RESCUE ME FROM A CONDITION THAT HAD NOW BECOME INSUPPORTABLE AS HE DREW NEAR I REMEMBERED WITH MANY MISGIVINGS THE INAUSPICIOUS TERMINATION OF OUR FORMER INTERVIEW AND WHEN HE ENTERED THE HOUSE I WATCHED WITH INTENSE ANXIETY
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IDLE FOR ME TO HAVE ATTEMPTED RESUMING THE INTERVIEW SO PEREMPTORILY TERMINATED BY MARNOO
AND SHAVEN HEADS DISPOSED IN A CIRCLE
WITH WHICH THEY SET TO IN COLUMN AND PUMMELLED ONE ANOTHER AT THE WORD OF COMMAND ONE DAY IN COMPANY WITH KORY KORY I HAD REPAIRED TO THE STREAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF BATHING
LAYING THEMSELVES DOWN BESIDE ME WOULD LEAVE ME AWHILE TO UNINTERRUPTED REPOSE I TOOK A STRANGE INTEREST IN THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENTS OF THE ECCENTRIC OLD WARRIOR ALL ALONE DURING THE STILLNESS OF THE TROPICAL MID DAY
FREQUENTLY SUSPENDING HIS EMPLOYMENT AND NOTICING MY MELANCHOLY EYE FIXED UPON HIM HE WOULD RAISE HIS HAND WITH A GESTURE EXPRESSIVE OF DEEP COMMISERATION AND THEN MOVING TOWARDS ME SLOWLY WOULD ENTER ON TIP TOES
FEARFUL OF DISTURBING THE SLUMBERING NATIVES AND TAKING THE FAN FROM MY HAND WOULD SIT BEFORE ME SWAYING IT GENTLY TO AND FRO AND GAZING EARNESTLY INTO MY FACE
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TOMMO WAI WATER
ITS MERITS AS A PREPARATION FOR THE HAIR ARE UNDENIABLE
I NATURALLY THOUGHT THAT ANYTHING COLLECTED AT SUCH PAINS MUST POSSESS PECULIAR MERITS BUT ONE MOUTHFUL WAS A COMPLETE DOSE AND GREAT WAS THE CONSTERNATION OF THE OLD WARRIOR AT THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH I EJECTED HIS EPICUREAN TREAT
THIS OIL IS OBTAINED IN GREAT ABUNDANCE BY THE FOLLOWING VERY SIMPLE PROCESS A LARGE VESSEL OF WOOD WITH HOLES PERFORATED IN THE BOTTOM IS FILLED WITH THE POUNDED MEAT AND EXPOSED TO THE RAYS OF THE SUN
I MIGHT YET EFFECT MY ESCAPE SHORTLY AFTER MARNOO'S VISIT I WAS REDUCED TO SUCH A STATE THAT IT WAS WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY I COULD WALK EVEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A SPEAR AND KORY KORY AS FORMERLY
FIRST PLACING A CALABASH BENEATH THE NOSE AS IT WERE OF HIS CURIOUS LOOKING LOG STEED FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING THE GRATED FRAGMENTS AS THEY FALL MOUNTS ASTRIDE OF IT AS IF IT WERE A HOBBY HORSE
HE WOULD PURSUE HIS QUIET WORK SITTING IN THE SHADE AND WEAVING TOGETHER THE LEAFLETS OF HIS COCOANUT BRANCHES OR ROLLING UPON HIS KNEE THE TWISTED FIBRES OF BARK TO FORM THE CORDS WITH WHICH HE TIED TOGETHER THE THATCHING OF HIS TINY HOUSE
AND IN THE END HE GAVE IT UP AND CONSOLED HIMSELF BY LISTENING TO MY REPETITION OF THE SOUNDS FIFTY TIMES OVER PREVIOUS TO MEHEVI'S MAKING THE DISCOVERY I HAD NEVER BEEN AWARE THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING OF THE NIGHTINGALE ABOUT ME
AND EVEN DURING THE HOURS DEVOTED TO SLUMBER THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT WHICH I MADE SEEMED TO ATTRACT THE NOTICE OF THOSE WHO SHARED THE MATS WITH ME IN SPITE OF THESE OBSTACLES HOWEVER I DETERMINED FORTHWITH TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT
CONSISTS IN PLACING ANY NUMBER OF THE FRESHLY PLUCKED FRUIT WHEN IN A PARTICULAR STATE OF GREENNESS AMONG THE EMBERS OF A FIRE IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU WOULD ROAST A POTATO AFTER THE LAPSE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES THE GREEN RIND EMBROWNS AND CRACKS
GIVING A MUSICAL PROLONGATION TO THE FINAL SYLLABLE OF EVERY SENTENCE AND CHIRPING OUT SOME OF THE WORDS WITH A LIQUID BIRD LIKE ACCENT WAS SINGULARLY PLEASING
THUS WOULD THEY EMPLOY THEMSELVES FOR AN HOUR OR TWO SOMETIMES LONGER LYING IN THE GLOOM WHICH WRAPPED THE FURTHER END OF THE HOUSE I COULD NOT AVOID LOOKING AT THEM
ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE VALLEY TREATED ME WITH GREAT KINDNESS BUT AS TO THE HOUSEHOLD OF MARHEYO WITH WHOM I WAS NOW PERMANENTLY DOMICILED NOTHING COULD SURPASS THEIR EFFORTS TO MINISTER TO MY COMFORT
AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHOEVER HE WAS RETURNED TO HIS MAT THIS WAS A SAD BLOW TO ME BUT AS IT MIGHT HAVE AROUSED THE SUSPICIONS OF THE ISLANDERS TO HAVE MADE ANOTHER ATTEMPT THAT NIGHT I WAS RELUCTANTLY OBLIGED TO DEFER IT UNTIL THE NEXT
WHETHER AGAINST THE EXPRESS WILL OF PROVIDENCE IT IS TWISTED UPON THE CROWN OF THE HEAD AND THERE COILED AWAY LIKE A ROPE ON A SHIP'S DECK WHETHER IT BE STUCK BEHIND THE EARS AND HANGS DOWN LIKE THE SWAG OF A SMALL WINDOW CURTAIN
WOULD COMMENCE A LOW DISMAL AND MONOTONOUS CHANT ACCOMPANYING THE VOICE WITH THE INSTRUMENTAL MELODY PRODUCED BY TWO SMALL HALF ROTTEN STICKS TAPPED SLOWLY TOGETHER A PAIR OF WHICH WERE HELD IN THE HANDS OF EACH PERSON PRESENT
SADLY DISCURSIVE AS I HAVE ALREADY BEEN I MUST STILL FURTHER ENTREAT THE READER'S PATIENCE AS I AM ABOUT TO STRING TOGETHER WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT AT ORDER A FEW ODDS AND ENDS OF THINGS NOT HITHERTO MENTIONED
INDUCES ME TO GIVE AT SOME LENGTH A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE TREE AND THE VARIOUS MODES IN WHICH THE FRUIT IS PREPARED THE BREAD FRUIT TREE IN ITS GLORIOUS PRIME IS A GRAND AND TOWERING OBJECT
WHEN I OBSERVED A WOMAN SITTING UPON A ROCK IN THE MIDST OF THE CURRENT AND WATCHING WITH THE LIVELIEST INTEREST THE GAMBOLS OF SOMETHING WHICH AT FIRST I TOOK TO BE AN UNCOMMONLY LARGE SPECIES OF FROG THAT WAS SPORTING IN THE WATER NEAR HER
WHOM I INVARIABLY MADE TO KNOCK UNDER TO MY SUPERIOR PROWESS SOMETIMES WHEN THIS SORELY BATTERED SHADOW RETREATED PRECIPITATELY TOWARDS A GROUP OF THE SAVAGES AND FOLLOWING HIM UP I RUSHED AMONG THEM DEALING MY BLOWS RIGHT AND LEFT
I DISCLOSED IT IN A FEW BRIEF WORDS TO THE STRANGER AND ASKED HIM HOW IT COULD BE BEST ACCOMPLISHED MY HEART SUNK WITHIN ME WHEN IN HIS BROKEN ENGLISH HE ANSWERED ME THAT IT COULD NEVER BE EFFECTED KANAKA NO LET YOU GO NOWHERE
IT HAS A MILD AND PLEASING FLAVOUR SOMETIMES AFTER HAVING BEEN ROASTED IN THE FIRE THE NATIVES SNATCH IT BRISKLY FROM THE EMBERS AND PERMITTING IT TO SLIP OUT OF THE YIELDING RIND INTO A VESSEL OF COLD WATER
WAS SOON OUT OF SIGHT A MODE OF ESCAPE WAS NOW PRESENTED TO ME BUT HOW WAS I TO AVAIL MYSELF OF IT I WAS CONTINUALLY SURROUNDED BY THE SAVAGES I COULD NOT STIR FROM ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER WITHOUT BEING ATTENDED BY SOME OF THEM
IT WAS ALSO BY NIGHT ALONE THAT I COULD HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH MY OBJECT AND THEN ONLY BY ADOPTING THE UTMOST PRECAUTION THE ENTRANCE TO MARHEYO'S HABITATION WAS THROUGH A LOW NARROW OPENING IN ITS WICKER WORK FRONT
AND A QUARTER SECTION OF A BREAD FRUIT IN THE OTHER THE GREATEST CHIEF IN THE VALLEY WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT ALL LUXURIES OF A PARISIAN TABLE THE CELEBRITY OF THE BREAD FRUIT TREE AND THE CONSPICUOUS PLACE IT OCCUPIES IN A TYPEE BILL OF FARE
THAT RENDERS IT A DISH FIT FOR A KING AS SOON AS IT IS TAKEN FROM THE FIRE THE EXTERIOR IS REMOVED THE CORE EXTRACTED AND THE REMAINING PART IS PLACED IN A SORT OF SHALLOW STONE MORTAR AND BRISKLY WORKED WITH A PESTLE OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE
THIS PASSAGE FOR NO CONCEIVABLE REASON THAT I COULD DEVISE WAS ALWAYS CLOSED AFTER THE HOUSEHOLD HAD RETIRED TO REST BY DRAWING A HEAVY SLIDE ACROSS IT COMPOSED OF A DOZEN OR MORE BITS OF WOOD INGENIOUSLY FASTENED TOGETHER BY SEIZINGS OF SINNATE
WITH A VIEW OF CAREFULLY NOTING THE PATH HE WOULD TAKE IN LEAVING THE VALLEY
AT THE TIME WHEN IT IS IN THE GREATEST PERFECTION THE FRUIT PRESENTS A BEAUTIFUL GLOBE OF WHITE PULP THE WHOLE OF WHICH MAY BE EATEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SLENDER CORE WHICH IS EASILY REMOVED
I WOULD PURPOSELY OMIT CLOSING THE PASSAGE AFTER ME AND TRUSTING THAT THE INDOLENCE OF THE SAVAGES WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM REPAIRING MY NEGLECT WOULD RETURN TO MY MAT AND WAITING PATIENTLY UNTIL ALL WERE AGAIN ASLEEP I WOULD THEN STEAL FORTH
BUT WHEN I DID SO MY VALET ALWAYS ROSE WITH ME AS IF DETERMINED I SHOULD NOT REMOVE MYSELF FROM HIS OBSERVATION FOR THE PRESENT THEREFORE I WAS OBLIGED TO ABANDON THE ATTEMPT BUT I ENDEAVOURED TO CONSOLE MYSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT BY THIS MODE
OR WHETHER IT BE PERMITTED TO FLOW OVER THE SHOULDERS IN NATURAL RINGLETS IT IS ALWAYS THE PRIDE OF THE OWNER AND THE GLORY OF THE TOILETTE THE TYPEE GIRLS DEVOTE MUCH OF THEIR TIME TO THE DRESSING OF THEIR FAIR AND REDUNDANT LOCKS
SOMETIMES WHEN AFTER FALLING INTO A KIND OF DOZE AND AWAKING SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF THESE DOLEFUL CHANTINGS MY EYE WOULD FALL UPON THE WILD LOOKING GROUP ENGAGED IN THEIR STRANGE OCCUPATION WITH THEIR NAKED TATTOOED LIMBS
AND THE VEGETABLE FRAGRANCE OF THEIR GREEN RIND SOON IMPARTS TO THE OIL A DELIGHTFUL ODOUR AFTER THE LAPSE OF A FEW WEEKS THE EXTERIOR SHELL OF THE NUTS BECOMES QUITE DRY AND HARD AND ASSUMES A BEAUTIFUL CARNATION TINT
ATTRACTED BY THE NOVELTY OF THE SIGHT I WADED TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE SHE SAT AND COULD HARDLY CREDIT THE EVIDENCE OF MY SENSES WHEN I BEHELD A LITTLE INFANT THE PERIOD OF WHOSE BIRTH COULD NOT HAVE EXTENDED BACK MANY DAYS PADDLING ABOUT
AH THEN SOME NIGHT KANAKA ALL MOEE MOEE SLEEP YOU RUN AWAY YOU COME PUEEARKA I SPEAK PUEEARKA KANAKA HE NO HARM YOU AH THEN I TAKE YOU MY CANOE NUKUHEVA
IN PREPARING THESE FOR USE HE MANIFESTED ALL THE OSTENTATION OF A PROFESSED COOK ALTHOUGH THE CHIEF MYSTERY OF THE AFFAIR APPEARED TO CONSIST IN POURING WATER IN JUDICIOUS QUANTITIES UPON THE SLIMY CONTENTS OF HIS COCOANUT SHELLS
FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING VARIOUS SPECIES OF RARE SEA WEED SOME OF WHICH AMONG THESE PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERED A GREAT LUXURY AFTER A WHOLE DAY SPENT IN THIS EMPLOYMENT HE WOULD RETURN ABOUT NIGHTFALL WITH SEVERAL COCOANUT SHELLS FILLED WITH DIFFERENT DESCRIPTIONS OF KELP
THE FRUIT SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES IN MAGNITUDE AND GENERAL APPEARANCE ONE OF OUR CITRON MELONS OF ORDINARY SIZE BUT UNLIKE THE CITRON IT HAS NO SECTIONAL LINES DRAWN ALONG THE OUTSIDE
APPEARED TO RESUME THEIR SLUMBERS AND REJOICING AT THE STILLNESS WHICH PREVAILED I WAS ABOUT TO RISE AGAIN FROM MY COUCH WHEN I HEARD A SLIGHT RUSTLING A DARK FORM WAS INTERCEPTED BETWEEN ME AND THE DOORWAY THE SLIDE WAS DRAWN ACROSS IT
AND YOU RUN AWAY SHIP NO MORE WITH THESE WORDS ENFORCED BY A VEHEMENCE OF GESTURE I CANNOT DESCRIBE MARNOO STARTED FROM MY SIDE AND IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH SOME OF THE CHIEFS WHO HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE
THE STICK IS SOMETIMES A GROTESQUELY FORMED LIMB OF A TREE WITH THREE OR FOUR BRANCHES TWISTING FROM ITS BODY LIKE SO MANY SHAPELESS LEGS AND SUSTAINING IT TWO OR THREE FEET FROM THE GROUND THE NATIVE
PROCEEDS TO GRATE THE JUICY MEAT INTO FINE PARTICLES THIS IS DONE BY MEANS OF A PIECE OF MOTHER OF PEARL SHELL LASHED FIRMLY TO THE EXTREME END OF A HEAVY STICK WITH ITS STRAIGHT SIDE ACCURATELY NOTCHED LIKE A SAW
AT MY REQUEST MY MATS WERE ALWAYS SPREAD DIRECTLY FACING THE DOOR OPPOSITE WHICH AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WAS THE HUT OF BOUGHS THAT MARHEYO WAS BUILDING WHENEVER MY GENTLE FAYAWAY AND KORY KORY
AND THE NEXT MOMENT BE CLASPED TO ITS MOTHER'S BOSOM THIS WAS REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN THE BABY REMAINING IN THE STREAM ABOUT A MINUTE AT A TIME ONCE OR TWICE IT MADE WRY FACES AT SWALLOWING A MOUTHFUL OF WATER
AND AT ONCE TAKE THE ROUTE TO PUEEARKA THE VERY NIGHT WHICH FOLLOWED MARNOO'S DEPARTURE I PROCEEDED TO PUT THIS PROJECT INTO EXECUTION ABOUT MIDNIGHT AS I IMAGINED I AROSE AND DREW THE SLIDE
THE RECEPTION HE MET WITH FROM ITS INMATES TO MY JOY HIS APPEARANCE WAS HAILED WITH THE LIVELIEST PLEASURE AND ACCOSTING ME KINDLY HE SEATED HIMSELF BY MY SIDE AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE NATIVES AROUND HIM
YOU SEE AH BY BY YOU NO MIND YOU GET WELL HE KILL YOU EAT YOU HANG YOU HEAD UP THERE LIKE HAPPAR KANAKA NOW YOU LISTEN BUT NO TALK ANY MORE BY BY I GO YOU SEE WAY I GO
SUPPOSE YOU NO LIKE THIS BAY WHY YOU COME YOU NO HEAR ABOUT TYPEE ALL WHITE MEN AFRAID TYPEE SO NO WHITE MEN COME THESE WORDS DISTRESSED ME BEYOND BELIEF
AFTER BATHING AS THEY SOMETIMES DO FIVE OR SIX TIMES EVERY DAY THE HAIR IS CAREFULLY DRIED AND IF THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE SEA INVARIABLY WASHED IN FRESH WATER AND ANOINTED WITH A HIGHLY SCENTED OIL EXTRACTED FROM THE MEAT OF THE COCOANUT
I COULD NOT REPRESS A SHUDDER OF ANGUISH HOW VIVIDLY IS IMPRESSED UPON MY MIND EVERY MINUTE FEATURE OF THE SCENE WHICH MET MY VIEW DURING THOSE LONG DAYS OF SUFFERING AND SORROW
WERE THREE MAGNIFICENT BREAD FRUIT TREES AT THIS MOMENT I CAN RECAP TO MY MIND THEIR SLENDER SHAFTS AND THE GRACEFUL INEQUALITIES OF THEIR BARK ON WHICH MY EYE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DWELL DAY AFTER DAY
FORMING THE SAME FEATURE IN A MARQUESAN LANDSCAPE THAT THE PATRIARCHAL ELM DOES IN NEW ENGLAND SCENERY THE LATTER TREE IT NOT A LITTLE RESEMBLES IN HEIGHT IN THE WIDE SPREAD OF ITS STALWART BRANCHES
SEVERAL TIMES AFTER I REPEATED THE SAME MANOEUVRE BUT WITH AS LITTLE SUCCESS AS BEFORE AS MY PRETENCE FOR WITHDRAWING FROM THE HOUSE WAS TO ALLAY MY THIRST KORY KORY EITHER SUSPECTING SOME DESIGN ON MY PART
HOW TRUE IT IS THAT THE RARITY OF ANY PARTICULAR ARTICLE ENHANCES ITS VALUE AMAZINGLY IN SOME PART OF THE VALLEY I KNOW NOT WHERE BUT PROBABLY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE SEA
THE ACTION OF THE OVEN HAVING CONVERTED IT INTO AN AMBER COLOURED CAKY SUBSTANCE A LITTLE TART BUT NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO THE TASTE BY ANOTHER AND FINAL PROCESS THE AMAR IS CHANGED INTO POEE POEE
IS OFTEN CONVERTED BY THE NATIVES INTO A SUPERB AND STRIKING HEAD DRESS THE PRINCIPAL FIBRE TRAVERSING ITS LENGTH BEING SPLIT OPEN A CONVENIENT DISTANCE AND THE ELASTIC SIDES OF THE APERTURE PRESSED APART THE HEAD IS INSERTED BETWEEN THEM
ONCE MORE THE APPROACH OF THE STRANGER WAS HERALDED AND THE INTELLIGENCE OPERATED UPON ME LIKE MAGIC AGAIN I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONVERSE WITH HIM IN MY OWN LANGUAGE AND I RESOLVE AT ALL HAZARDS TO CONCERT WITH HIM SOME SCHEME HOWEVER DESPERATE
WHEN I REFLECTED THAT MY DREADFUL FATE WOULD FOR EVER BE CONCEALED FROM THEM AND THAT WITH HOPE DEFERRED THEY MIGHT CONTINUE TO AWAIT MY RETURN LONG AFTER MY INANIMATE FORM HAD BLENDED WITH THE DUST OF THE VALLEY
OR ELSE PROMPTED BY A DESIRE TO PLEASE ME REGULARLY EVERY EVENING PLACED A CALABASH OF WATER BY MY SIDE EVEN UNDER THESE INAUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES I AGAIN AND AGAIN RENEWED THE ATTEMPT
AS NOT ONE OF THE NATIVES HAD SOUL ENOUGH IN HIM TO STAND UP LIKE A MAN AND ALLOW ME TO HAMMER AWAY AT HIM FOR MY OWN PERSONAL GRATIFICATION AND THAT OF THE KING I WAS NECESSITATED TO FIGHT WITH AN IMAGINARY ENEMY
THE LEAF DROOPING ON ONE SIDE WITH ITS FORWARD HALF TURNED JAUNTILY UP ON THE BROWS AND THE REMAINING PART SPREADING LATERALLY BEHIND THE EARS
THE FLEETING SHADES OF THE EXPIRING DOLPHIN THE AUTUMNAL TINTS OF OUR AMERICAN FORESTS GLORIOUS AS THEY ARE SINK INTO NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH THIS TREE
GRASPING THE CALABASH ON HEARING MY REPLY THEY SANK BACK AGAIN AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO I RETURNED TO MY MAT ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE SAVAGES TURNING RESTLESSLY
THE SOUNDS PRODUCED BY THE NATIVES ON THESE OCCASIONS WERE OF A MOST SINGULAR DESCRIPTION AND HAD I NOT ACTUALLY BEEN PRESENT I NEVER WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT SUCH CURIOUS NOISES COULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY HUMAN BEINGS
THE GIRLS WERE SOMETIMES IN THE HABIT OF PROCURING SMALL QUANTITIES OF SALT A THIMBLE FULL OR SO BEING THE RESULT OF THE UNITED LABOURS OF A PARTY OF FIVE OR SIX EMPLOYED FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY THIS PRECIOUS COMMODITY THEY BROUGHT TO THE HOUSE
FROM WHENCE THEY ARE DRAWN AS OCCASION MAY REQUIRE IN THIS CONDITION THE TUTAO SOMETIMES REMAINS FOR YEARS AND EVEN IS THOUGHT TO IMPROVE BY AGE BEFORE IT IS FIT TO BE EATEN HOWEVER IT HAS TO UNDERGO AN ADDITIONAL PROCESS
THE BREAD FRUIT HOWEVER IS NEVER USED AND IS INDEED ALTOGETHER UNFIT TO BE EATEN UNTIL SUBMITTED IN ONE FORM OR OTHER TO THE ACTION OF FIRE THE MOST SIMPLE MANNER IN WHICH THIS OPERATION IS PERFORMED AND I THINK THE BEST
THE OIL UNDERGOES A PURIFYING PROCESS AND IS THEN POURED INTO THE SMALL SPHERICAL SHELLS OF THE NUTS OF THE MOO TREE WHICH ARE HOLLOWED OUT TO RECEIVE IT THESE NUTS ARE THEN HERMETICALLY SEALED WITH A RESINOUS GUM
AND OVERSPREAD WITH ANOTHER LAYER OF LEAVES THE WHOLE IS THEN QUICKLY HEAPED UP WITH EARTH AND FORMS A SLOPING MOUND THE TUTAO THUS BAKED IS CALLED AMAR
IN THE COOL OF THE MORNING AND EVENING AND TREATING IT TO A BATH NO WONDER THAT THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDERS ARE SO AMPHIBIOUS A RACE WHEN THEY ARE THUS LAUNCHED INTO THE WATER AS SOON AS THEY SEE THE LIGHT
AND LOOKING SIGNIFICANTLY AT ME EXCLAIMED NOW YOU SEE YOU DO WHAT I TELL YOU AH THEN YOU DO GOOD YOU NO DO SO AH THEN YOU DIE
AMIDST ALL THE BUSTLE AND STIR OF THE PROUD AND BUSY CITY IN WHICH I AM DWELLING THE IMAGE OF THOSE THREE TREES SEEMS TO COME AS VIVIDLY BEFORE MY EYES AS IF THEY WERE ACTUALLY PRESENT
THE DIFFICULTY THUS PLACED IN MY WAY I DETERMINED TO OBVIATE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER I WOULD GET UP BOLDLY IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT AND DRAWING THE SLIDE ISSUE FROM THE HOUSE AND PRETEND THAT MY OBJECT WAS MERELY TO PROCURE A DRINK FROM THE CALABASH
THE NATIVES JUST AS I HAD EXPECTED STARTED UP WHILE SOME OF THEM ASKED
ENVELOPED IN MULTITUDINOUS FOLDS OF LEAVES AND AS A SPECIAL MARK OF THE ESTEEM IN WHICH THEY HELD ME WOULD SPREAD AN IMMENSE LEAF ON THE GROUND AND DROPPING ONE BY ONE A FEW MINUTE PARTICLES OF THE SALT UPON IT INVITE ME TO TASTE THEM
BUT THE PLAN HE HAD SUGGESTED STRUCK ME AS ONE WHICH MIGHT POSSIBLY BE ACCOMPLISHED AND I RESOLVED TO ACT UPON IT AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE ACCORDINGLY WHEN HE AROSE TO DEPART I ACCOMPANIED HIM WITH THE NATIVES OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE
THE MEN HOWEVER ARE NOT QUITE SO HARMONIOUS IN THEIR UTTERANCE AND WHEN EXCITED UPON ANY SUBJECT WOULD WORK THEMSELVES UP INTO A SORT OF WORDY PAROXYSM DURING WHICH ALL DESCRIPTIONS OF ROUGH SIDED SOUNDS WERE PROJECTED FROM THEIR MOUTHS
FROM THE EXTRAVAGANT VALUE PLACED UPON THE ARTICLE I VERILY BELIEVE THAT WITH A BUSHEL OF COMMON LIVERPOOL SALT ALL THE REAL ESTATE IN TYPEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED WITH A SMALL PINCH OF IT IN ONE HAND
AND HAS FOUR OR FIVE STOPS WITH A LARGE HOLE NEAR ONE END WHICH LATTER IS HELD JUST BENEATH THE LEFT NOSTRIL THE OTHER NOSTRIL BEING CLOSED BY A PECULIAR MOVEMENT OF THE MUSCLES ABOUT THE NOSE THE BREATH IS FORCED INTO THE TUBE
THIS PREPARATION IS CALLED KOKOO AND A MOST LUSCIOUS PREPARATION IT IS THE HOBBY HORSE AND THE PESTLE AND MORTAR WERE IN GREAT REQUISITION DURING THE TIME I REMAINED IN THE HOUSE OF MARHEYO
IN THE MIDST OF MY SOLITARY MUSINGS IT IS STRANGE HOW INANIMATE OBJECTS WILL TWINE THEMSELVES INTO OUR AFFECTIONS ESPECIALLY IN THE HOUR OF AFFLICTION EVEN NOW
STIR UP THE MIXTURE WHICH THEY CALL BO A SHO I NEVER COULD ENDURE THIS COMPOUND AND INDEED THE PREPARATION IS NOT GREATLY IN VOGUE AMONG THE MORE POLITE TYPEES THERE IS ONE FORM HOWEVER IN WHICH THE FRUIT IS OCCASIONALLY SERVED
I AM CONVINCED THAT IT IS AS NATURAL FOR A HUMAN BEING TO SWIM AS IT IS FOR A DUCK AND YET IN CIVILIZED COMMUNITIES HOW MANY ABLE BODIED INDIVIDUALS DIE LIKE SO MANY DROWNING KITTENS FROM THE OCCURRENCE OF THE MOST TRIVIAL ACCIDENTS
THEY WOULD DISPERSE IN ALL DIRECTIONS MUCH TO THE ENJOYMENT OF MEHEVI THE CHIEFS AND THEMSELVES THE NOBLE ART OF SELF DEFENCE APPEARED TO BE REGARDED BY THEM AS THE PECULIAR GIFT OF THE WHITE MAN
BUT WHICH ARE EITHER CURIOUS IN THEMSELVES OR PECULIAR TO THE TYPEES THERE WAS ONE SINGULAR CUSTOM OBSERVED IN OLD MARHEYO'S DOMESTIC ESTABLISHMENT WHICH OFTEN EXCITED MY SURPRISE EVERY NIGHT BEFORE RETIRING
HE SAID YOU TABOO WHY YOU NO LIKE TO STAY PLENTY MOEE MOEE SLEEP PLENTY KI KI EAT PLENTY WAHENEE YOUNG GIRLS OH VERY GOOD PLACE TYPEE
THE FLICKERING RAYS OF THE ARMOR NUT JUST SERVED TO REVEAL THEIR SAVAGE LINEAMENTS WITHOUT DISPELLING THE DARKNESS THAT HOVERED ABOUT THEM
THIS IS THE FORM IN WHICH THE TUTAO IS GENERALLY CONSUMED THE SINGULAR MODE OF EATING IT I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED WERE IT NOT THAT THE BREAD FRUIT IS THUS CAPABLE OF BEING PRESERVED FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
THE KING WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE VERSE BUT THE CHORUS FAIRLY TRANSPORTED HIM AT HIS SOLICITATION I SANG IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE LUDICROUS THAN HIS VAIN ATTEMPTS TO CATCH THE AIR AND THE WORDS
THIS STATELY TREE WHICH IS RARELY MET WITH UPON THE SANDWICH ISLANDS AND THEN ONLY OF A VERY INFERIOR QUALITY AND AT TAHITI DOES NOT ABOUND TO A DEGREE THAT RENDERS ITS FRUIT THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF FOOD
ITS SURFACE IS DOTTED ALL OVER WITH LITTLE CONICAL PROMINENCES LOOKING NOT UNLIKE THE KNOBS ON AN ANTIQUATED CHURCH DOOR THE RIND IS PERHAPS AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS AND DENUDED OF THIS
THERE ARE NO OTHER MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AMONG THE TYPEES EXCEPT ONE WHICH MIGHT APPROPRIATELY BE DENOMINATED A NASAL FLUTE IT IS SOMEWHAT LONGER THAN AN ORDINARY FIFE IS MADE OF A BEAUTIFUL SCARLET COLOURED REED
AND KORY KORY HAD FREQUENT OCCASION TO SHOW HIS SKILL IN THEIR USE BUT THE GREAT STAPLE ARTICLES OF FOOD INTO WHICH THE BREAD FRUIT IS CONVERTED BY THESE NATIVES ARE KNOWN RESPECTIVELY BY THE NAMES OF AMAR AND POEE POEE
ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE DAY BREAK A COUNCIL OF WAR WAS HELD AMONGST THE OFFICERS
AND CAPTAIN DADLEBERG OF THE REMBANG INDIAMAN WAS MAKING EVERY POSSIBLE DISPATCH WITH HIS SHIP TO CARRY US TO BATAVIA DURING THIS TIME THE INTERMENT OF BALTHAZAR
THEIR PERSON OR QUALITY MAY BE IDENTIFIED
THE ALLIGATORS ARE DARING AND NUMEROUS THERE ARE INSTANCES OF THEIR DEVOURING MEN AND CHILDREN WHEN BATHING IN THE SHALLOW PART OF THE RIVER ABOVE THE TOWN THE GOVERNOR MYNHEER VANION
AND WARLIKE STORES FEUDS AND DISSENTIONS ARE KINDLED AMONGST THEM AND THEY ARE KEPT SO COMPLETELY ENGAGED IN CIVIL WAR THAT THEY HAVE NO TIME TO OBSERVE THE ENCROACHMENTS OF STRANGERS THAT DOMESTIC STRIFE SERVES
TO SEE THAT WEDGEWOOD'S STONEWARE AND BIRMINGHAM GOODS
PART OF THE CREW AND PASSENGERS OF AN ENGLISH BRIG WRECKED IN THESE SEAS HIS HOUSE WHICH HAS EVER BEEN THE ASYLUM
ONE OF THE MEN AND THE WOMAN FLED INTO THE WOODS BUT WERE SOON TAKEN THEY CONFESSED THEY WERE ENGLISH CONVICTS AND THAT THEY HAD MADE THEIR ESCAPE FROM BOTANY BAY THEY HAD BEEN SUPPLIED WITH A QUADRANT A COMPASS A CHART
IS WAX HONEY AND SANDLEWOOD BUT THE WHOLE OF ITS REVENUES DO NOT DEFRAY THE EXPENCE OF THE SETTLEMENT TO THE COMPANY BUT FROM THE LOCALITY OF ITS SITUATION IT IS CONVENIENT FOR THEIR OTHER ISLANDS
AND A NUMBER OF VENOMOUS REPTILES WITH WHICH THIS COUNTRY ABOUNDS THERE IS ONE IN PARTICULAR CALLED THE COWK COWK IT IS THE MOST DISGUSTING LOOKING ANIMAL THAT CREEPS THE GROUND AND ITS BITE IS MORTAL
BUT OUR THIRST WAS TOO EXCESSIVE TO BEAR ANY THING
FOR STAGNANT MUD THAN FROM CLIMATE
BUT BEFORE THE TACKS WERE HAULED ON BOARD AND THE SAILS TRIMMED
THAT IN A YEAR OR TWO THIS BEAUTIFUL TOWN WILL BE COMPLETELY DAMMED IN A FEW DAYS WE ARRIVED AT BATAVIA THE EMPOREUM OF THE DUTCH IN THE EAST AND OUR FIRST CARE WAS EMPLOYED IN SENDING TO THE HOSPITAL
COMPANY'S HEALTH LED US TO REQUEST AN EXPLANATION WHEN WE WERE INFORMED THEY FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE THEM BELIEVE
THIS WAS TAPPED AND SERVED REGULARLY TO ALL HANDS WHICH WAS MUCH PREFERABLE TO SPIRITS AS IT GAVE THEM STRENGTH WITHOUT INTOXICATION DURING THIS TRYING OCCASION THE MEN BEHAVED WITH THE UTMOST INTREPIDITY AND OBEDIENCE
THE COMMANDING OFFICER WHO HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SHOOT HIM ON NOT FINDING THE SHIP NEXT DAY THEY GAVE UP ALL FURTHER HOPES OF HER AND STEERED FOR ANAMOOKA THE RENDEZVOUS CAPTAIN EDWARDS HAD APPOINTED
TO THIS MINUTE THE MEN NEVER SWERVED FROM THEIR DUTY SHE NOW TOOK A VERY HEAVY HEEL
IN OUR PASSAGE FROM THIS TO THE CAPE BEFORE WE LEFT JAVA ONE OF THE CONVICTS HAD JUMPED OVER BOARD IN THE NIGHT AND SWAM TO THE DUTCH ARSENAL AT HONROOST
HAVING REPRESENTED THIS PART OF THE OCEAN AS EXCEEDINGLY DANGEROUS AND IT CERTAINLY IS THE BOLDEST PIECE OF NAVIGATION
WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL KING LEST THEY SHOULD NOT BE INCLINED TO PAY THAT SUBMISSION TO A COMPANY OF MERCHANTS THE INAUGURAL CEREMONY AT THE INSTALLATION OF THE YOUNG KING
ON THE TWENTY FIRST WE GOT THROUGH ALICE
RUN DOWN TO LEEWARD WHICH CRUSHED ONE MAN TO DEATH ABOUT THE SAME TIME A SPARE TOPMAST CAME DOWN FROM THE BOOMS AND KILLED ANOTHER MAN THE PEOPLE NOW BECAME FAINT
AND WHEN THE ALARM IS GIVEN BY THE PIQUET GUARD
WHICH WE NAMED MOUNT TEMPLE
THIS IS THE MONTPELIER OF THE EAST TO THE DUTCH AND PORTUGUESE SETTLEMENTS IN INDIA AND FROM THE SALUBRITY OF ITS AIR IS THE FAVOURITE RESORT OF VALETUDINARIANS AND INVALIDS FROM BATAVIA AND OTHER PLACES
SEEMS TO HAVE STUDIED WITH MUCH INGENUITY TO RENDER IT A CADAVEROUS STINKING PRISON AFTER BEING REFRESHED AT THE CAPE WE PASSED SAINT HELENA THE ISLAND OF ASCENSION AND ARRIVED AT HOLLAND
AT THOSE ISLANDS WHICH WERE INHABITED AFTER MUCH DIVERSITY OF DISTRESS AND SIMILAR ENCOUNTERS THEY AT LAST MADE THE REEF THAT RUNS BETWEEN NEW GUINEA AND NEW HOLLAND WHERE THE PANDORA MET HER UNHAPPY FATE AND AFTER
THEY WERE HOWEVER PERFECTLY IGNORANT OF FIRE ARMS AND SEEMED MUCH STARTLED AT THE REPORT OF A MUSKET WERE TOO SHY TO STAND THE EXPERIMENT OF A GREAT GUN AS THEY CAME OFF WITH HOSTILE INTENTIONS THEY BROUGHT NO WOMEN WITH THEM
AND THEIR VESSEL BEING BUILT OF FOREIGN TIMBER SERVED TO CONFIRM THEM IN THEIR SUSPICIONS AND AS NO OFFICER IN THE BRITISH NAVY BEARS A COMMISSION OR WARRANT UNDER THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHERE BY SEAL OF OFFICE
AND SOME SMALL ARMS AND AMMUNITION FROM A DUTCH SHIP THAT LAY THERE AND THE EXPEDITION WAS CONDUCTED BY THE GOVERNOR'S FISHERMAN WHOSE TIME OF TRANSPORTATION WAS EXPIRED HE WAS A GOOD SEAMAN AND A TOLERABLE NAVIGATOR
WAS PERFORMED BY HIS DRINKING A BUMPER OF BRANDY AND GUNPOWDER STIRRED ROUND WITH THE POINT OF A SWORD AFTER BEING INVESTED WITH THE REGAL DIGNITY HE CAME DOWN IN STATE TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO THE GOVERNOR
WE HAVE NO CAPTAIN FOR THEY HAD REPORTED THAT THE CAPTAIN AND REMAINDER OF THE CREW HAD SEPARATED FROM THEM AT SEA IN ANOTHER BOAT THIS IMMEDIATELY LED TO A SUSPICION OF THEIR BEING IMPOSTORS AND THEY WERE ORDERED TO BE APPREHENDED AND PUT INTO THE CASTLE
WITH HILL AND DALE AND EQUALLY BEAUTIFUL AS DIVERSIFIED WITH ROTTI AND ITS APPENDANT ISLES IT IS AS LARGE AS THE ISLAND OF GREAT BRITAIN ITS PRINCIPAL TRADE
AS THE OCCURRENCES AT THIS TIME BORE SOME SEMBLANCE TO THE TRANSACTIONS IN OUR LAST VISIT TO AVOID WOUNDING THE DELICATE OR SATIATING THE LICENTIOUS WE SHALL CONCLUDE
HE OVERPOWERED THEM ALL AND JUMPED OVERBOARD WITH HIS PRIZE
THAN ANY WE HAD SEEN FOR SOME TIME THEY HAVE FREQUENT INTERCOURSE WITH ANAMOOKA AND THEIR RELIGION
RELATES A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAPPENED TO HIM WHILE HUNTING IN CROSSING A SHALLOW PART OF THE RIVER HIS BLACK BOY WAS SNAPPED UP BY AN ALLIGATOR BUT THE GOVERNOR IMMEDIATELY DISMOUNTED RESCUED THE BOY OUT OF HIS MOUTH
WAS COMPOSED OF VERY LARGE STONES AND CALLED IT STONY REEF ISLAND
IN THE NIGHT WE WERE DISTURBED BY THE IRREGULAR BEHAVIOUR OF ONE CONNELL WHICH LED US TO SUSPECT HE HAD STOLE OUR WINE AND GOT DRUNK BUT ON FURTHER INQUIRY WE FOUND THAT THE EXCRUCIATING TORTURE HE SUFFERED FROM THIRST
IT HAD LATELY BEEN OUR CUSTOM TO LAY TO IN THE NIGHT
THOSE VILE HAWKERS OF SPICE AND NUTMEGS EXACT A SUBMISSION THAT THE MOST ABSOLUTE AND TYRANNICAL MONARCH
AND THE GLOOMY HORRORS OF DEATH
THE LEAK GAINING FAST UPON US AND SHE WAS DRIVING DOWN
THEY MADE AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE VESSEL FROM THEM WHICH THEY ALWAYS WILL TO A SMALL VESSEL WHEN ALONE BUT THEY WERE SOON OVERPOWERED WITH THE FIRE ARMS
OR ONE OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL MEETS A CARRIAGE THE GENTLEMAN WHO MEETS HIM MUST ALIGHT AND MAKE HIM A PERFECT BOW IN SPIRIT NOT ONE OF BUNBURRY'S LONG BOWS BUT THAT BOW
ARRIVED AT THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE HERE WE MET WITH MANY CIVILITIES FROM COLONEL GORDON A GENTLEMAN NO LESS EMINENT FOR HIS PRIVATE VIRTUES THAN HIS EXTRAORDINARY MILITARY AND LITERARY ACCOMPLISHMENTS FROM HIS LABOURS
ON ACCOUNT OF THE BROKEN WATER AND THE VERY HIGH SURF THAT WAS RUNNING NEAR US WE BALED BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FOR HAD SHE GONE DOWN BEFORE DAY LIGHT EVERY SOUL MUST HAVE PERISHED SHE NOW TOOK A HEEL AND SOME OF THE GUNS
HAD BEEN THROWN INTO THE BOAT THE HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE REFLECTION FROM THE SAND WAS NOW EXCRUCIATING AND OUR STOMACHS BEING FILLED WITH SALT WATER FROM THE GREAT LENGTH OF TIME WE WERE SWIMMING BEFORE WE WERE PICKED UP
WE FELT MORE INTERESTED IN THE FATE OF THIS POOR WRETCH ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HAVING BEEN A PRINCE HIMSELF
TO WHICH WE GAVE NO PARTICULAR NAME AND TWO MORE ISLANDS TO THE WESTWARD CALLED BICKERTON'S ISLANDS INCLUDING TWO SMALL ISLANDS NEAR THE ABOVE
WHEN I TELL THEM PROFESSIONALLY THAT ALL THE MORTALITY OF THAT PLACE ORIGINATES FROM MARSH EFFLUVIA ARISING FROM THEIR STAGNANT CANALS AND PLEASURE GROUNDS
GAVE HIM UP AS A SLAVE
WE WOULD GLADLY HAVE CONTINUED THE SAME CUSTOM BUT THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE VOYAGE WOULD NOT PERMIT IT
AND A MOUNTAIN BETWEEN THEM WE NAMED MOUNT CLARENCE AFTER PASSING CAPE HOOD THE LAND APPEARS LOWER AND TO TRENCH AWAY ABOUT NORTH WEST FORMING A DEEP BAY AND IT MAY BE DOUBTED
TO THE SOUTHWARD STOOD TO THE WESTWARD WHERE THERE APPEARED TO BE AN OPENING WE SAW AN ISLAND IN THAT DIRECTION AND A REEF EXTENDING A CONSIDERABLE WAY TO THE NORTH WEST
THE NATIVES BARTER THEIR PRODUCE AND SELL THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR WHO ARE CARRIED TO BATAVIA AS SLAVES AND THE NATIVES OF JAVA SENT FROM BATAVIA TO THIS PLACE IN RETURN AS THEY HOLD THEIR TENURE
AND ALTHOUGH FIVE OF THE STOUTEST MEN IN THE SHIP WERE HANGING UPON HIM
WHICH IS USED IN ALL TEMPLES MOSQUES AND PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE EAST EVERY CHINESE HAVING A SPRIG OF IT BURNING DAY AND NIGHT NEAR THEIR HOUSEHOLD GODS THE EXCLUSIVE TRADE OF SANDLEWOOD
IN PASSING THE ISLAND OF FLORES A MOST TREMENDOUS STORM AROSE IN A FEW MINUTES EVERY SAIL OF THE SHIP WAS SHIVERED TO PIECES
SEEING OUR PASSAGE OBSTRUCTED AND STOOD OFF AND ON UNDER AN EASY SAIL
FOUND NO BOTTOM THIS WAS CALLED PANDORA'S REEF ON THE TWELFTH IN THE MORNING WE DISCOVERED AN ISLAND WELL WOODED BUT NOT INHABITED IT HAD TWO REMARKABLE PROMONTORIES ON IT
THEIR DISTRESS FOR WANT OF WATER IF POSSIBLE SURPASSED THAT OF OUR OWN AND HAD SO STRONG AN EFFECT ON ONE OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN THAT THE DAY FOLLOWING HE BECAME DELIRIOUS AND CONTINUED SO FOR SOME MONTHS AFTER IT
THE SCHEME OF THE TOPSAIL WAS NOW LAID ASIDE AND EVERY SOUL FELL TO BALING AND PUMPING ALL THE BOATS EXCEPTING ONE
WHILST HE WAS FORGING BOLTS AND FETTERS FOR OUR PRISONERS AND CONVICTS HERE THE SUNSHINE OF PROSPERITY AND THE MUTABILITY OF HUMAN GREATNESS WERE EXCELLENTLY POURTRAYED
IN THIS VOYAGE IN MANY PLACES OF THE COAST OF SOUTH WALES THEY FOUND VERY GOOD COAL A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WAS NOT BEFORE KNOWN OUR MEN WERE NOW BEGINNING TO REGAIN THEIR STRENGTH
WHETHER IT JOINS NEW GUINEA OR NOT WE PURSUED OUR COURSE TO THE WESTWARD KEEPING ENDEAVOUR STRAITS OPEN BY WHICH MEANS WE HOPED TO AVOID THE DANGERS CAPTAIN COOK MET WITH IN HIGHER LATITUDES
TO THROW ANY STIGMA ON THE DUTCH WHO I BELIEVE WOULD FIGHT THE DEVIL
AND BIRDS UPON EVERY PART OF THEM SO THAT EVERY MAN WAS A MOVING LANDSCAPE THESE MARKS WERE ALL RAISED AND DONE I SUPPOSE BY PINCHING UP THE SKIN THEY WERE GREAT ADEPTS IN THIEVING AND UNCOMMONLY ATHLETIC AND STRONG
TO THE REST OF MANKIND IN POINT OF SIZE AND CONSTITUTION THAT THEY MAY BE CALLED NONDESCRIPTS THEIR HOSPITAL AS TO SCITE SURPASSES ANY IN THE WORLD IT MAY BE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT THE ARCHITECT
THE FIRST TOAST AFTER DINNER WAS THE DEAD KING'S HEALTH NEXT THEY DRANK MYNHEER COMPANY'S HEALTH WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH A VOLLEY OF SMALL ARMS AND PATERREROS
IT IS ABOUT SEVEN MILES LONG AND BEING A NEW DISCOVERY WE CALLED IT GRENVILLE'S ISLAND IN HONOUR OF LORD GRENVILLE THE NAME THE NATIVES GAVE IT IS ROTUMAH THEY CAME OFF IN A FLEET OF CANOES RESTED ON THEIR PADDLES
WHICH CARRIES HUMILITY AND SUBMISSION IN IT THAT SORT OF BOW
THEY DRAGGED ALONG THE COAST OF NEW SOUTH WALES AND AS OFTEN AS THE HOSTILE NATURE OF THE SAVAGE NATIVES WOULD PERMIT HAULED THEIR BOAT UP AT NIGHT AND SLEPT ON SHORE THEY MET WITH SEVERAL CURIOUS AND INTERESTING ANECDOTES
WOULD BE ASHAMED OF THE COMPASS OF MY WORK WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO BE PARTICULAR BUT I MUST INSTANCE ONE AMONG MANY OTHERS
SOME OF THE PRISONERS WERE LET OUT OF IRONS AND TURNED TO THE PUMPS AT THIS DREADFUL CRISIS IT BLEW VERY VIOLENTLY AND SHE BEAT SO HARD UPON THE ROCKS THAT WE EXPECTED HER EVERY MINUTE TO GO TO PIECES
WHICH BEING COPPER WE CUT UP AND CONVERTED INTO NAILS FOR FITTING OUT THE BOATS SOME OF THE GIGANTIC COCKLE WAS BOILED AND CUT INTO JUNKS
ON THE TWENTY FIFTH SAW BREAKERS HAULED UP AND PASSED TO THE WESTWARD OF THEM THE SEA BROKE VERY GENTLY ON THEM TO THESE WE GAVE THE NAME OF LOOK OUT SHOALS BEFORE NOON WE SAW MORE BREAKERS THE REEF OF WHICH
BY WHICH MEANS HE WENT MAD AND DIED IN THE SEQUEL OF THE VOYAGE NEXT MORNING MISTER GEORGE PASSMORE THE MASTER WAS DISPATCHED IN ONE OF THE BOATS TO VISIT THE WRECK TO SEE IF ANY THING FLOATED ROUND HER
THE GOVERNOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND ALL THE EUROPEANS WERE INVITED SIX MONTHS HAD BEEN SPENT IN PREPARATIONS FOR THIS FETE AT WHICH AN EMPEROR AND TWENTY FIVE KINGS ASSISTED AND ATTENDED IN PERSON WITH ALL THEIR BODY GUARDS
ALTHOUGH THEY KEPT A STRICT GUARD OVER THEM NOTHING WAS WITHHELD TO RENDER THEIR SITUATION AGREEABLE AND THEY WERE SENT
THE DUTCH SEAMEN WERE STRUCK WITH HORROR AND WENT BELOW AND THE SHIP WAS PRESERVED FROM DESTRUCTION BY THE MANLY EXERTION OF OUR ENGLISH TARS
WHICH PROMISES BETTER ANCHORAGE THAN ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE FRIENDLY ISLES THE NATIVES TOLD US THERE WERE EXCELLENT WATERING PLACES IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTS WITHIN THE SOUND
THE TOWN IS REGULAR AND BEAUTIFUL AND THE HOUSES ARE BUILT IN A STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE WHICH HAS GIVEN LOOSE TO THE MOST SPORTIVE FANCY EACH STREET IS TERMINATED WITH SOME PUBLIC BUILDING SUCH AS A GREAT MARINE SCHOOL
IMPERTINENCE IN ME TO MAKE ANY COMMENT ON IT BUT WHEN THE WHOLE GLOBE LENDS ITS AID TO SUPPLY THIS DESTRUCTIVE SETTLEMENT
OR SHELTERING IN THE TRANSLUCENT STREAM FROM THE FERVOUR OF MERIDIAN HEAT YOU ARE SUDDENLY CHILLED WITH FEAR FROM THE TERRIFIC ASPECT OF THE ALLIGATOR
HE HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXTENDING HIS HOSPITALITY TO SHIPWRECKED ENGLISHMEN ABOUT A FORTNIGHT BEFORE WE ARRIVED A BOAT WITH EIGHT MEN A WOMAN AND TWO CHILDREN CAME ON SHORE HERE WHO TOLD HIM
WAS OPEN FOR THEIR RECEPTION THEY DREW BILLS ON THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND WERE SUPPLIED WITH EVERY NECESSARY THEY STOOD IN NEED OF THE CAPTAIN OF A DUTCH
AND THE EVENING WAS SPENT WITH CARDS AND CONCERTS I COULD DWELL WITH PLEASURE FOR AN AGE IN PRAISE OF THIS HONEST DUTCHMAN IT IS THE TRIBUTE OF A GRATEFUL HEART AND HIS DUE THIS IS THE THIRD TIME
THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO US IN OUR PRESENT DISTRESSED STATE HE RETURNED IN TWO HOURS AND BROUGHT WITH HIM A CAT WHICH HE FOUND CLINGING TO THE TOP GALLANT MAST HEAD A PIECE
THROUGH THE INTERPOSITION OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE TO BE AGAIN LANDED ON OUR NATIVE SHORE
LIKEWISE AMPLY TO SUPPLY THE SLAVE TRADE FROM THE PRISONERS OF BOTH PARTIES THEY HOWEVER SOME TIME SINCE MADE HEAD AGAINST THE COMMON ENEMY
HAS THE HAPPINESS TO JOIN
IT MAY BE REMARKED THAT THE STRAITS OF ALICE
PROW VESSELS WHO ARE A VERY DARING SET OF PIRATES THAT INFEST THOSE SEAS ON THE TWENTY SECOND
MAY BE CALLED MOUNTAINS THEY ARE CULTIVATED TO THE TOP THE REASON OF WHICH I PRESUME
THIS EVENING
BUT WISHING TO BE WELL INFORMED IN SO INTRICATE A BUSINESS AND THE DAY BEING FAR SPENT WE WAITED THE BOATS COMING ON BOARD
TO GET READY TO DISCOVER IF THERE WAS A PASSAGE FOR THE SHIP
THERE WAS SOMETHING RESEMBLING A FORTIFICATION WE SAW AT THE SAME TIME THREE TWO MASTED BOATS WE KEPT RUNNING ALONG THE REEF AND IN THE FORENOON THOUGHT WE SAW AN OPENING
THE BOAT WAS NOW SEEN CLOSE UNDER THE STERN WE WERE AT THE SAME TIME LYING TO TO PREVENT THE SHIP FORE REACHING IMMEDIATELY ON SOUNDING THIS LAST TIME
WAS AT FIRST AWFUL IN THE EXTREME BUT AS THEY SUNK AND BECAME FAINT IT DIED AWAY BY DEGREES THE BOATS WHO WERE AT SOME CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE IN THE DRIFT OF THE TIDE
HAS NOT BEEN NEGLECTED AND THOSE OBJECTS OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE ARE PLACED IN A PROPER POINT OF VIEW AS THE JUST PRIDE AND ORNAMENT OF A GREAT COMMERCIAL PEOPLE SUCH IS THE EFFECT OF EARLY PREJUDICES THAT UNDER THE MUZLE OF THE SUN
BY THE NATIVES ALL REMARKABLE FOR THE RICHNESS AND VARIETY OF THEIR PLUMAGE THE GROUP OF ISLANDS WAS CALLED HOWE'S ISLANDS BUT WERE PARTICULARLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE NAMES OF BARRINGTON'S SAWYER'S HOTHAM'S AND JARVIS'S ISLANDS
TO THE WASTWARD OF BOUGAINVILLE'S TRACK THE OCEAN WAS PERFECTLY UNEXPLORED AT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON A SIGNAL WAS MADE FROM THE BOAT THAT A PASSAGE THROUGH THE REEF WAS DISCOVERED FOR THE SHIP
TAKING WITH US THE PRISONERS AND CONVICTS
THEY HAVE A GOVERNOR OF THEIR OWN NATION BUT PAY LARGE TRIBUTE TO THE DUTCH NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR TRADE IS UNDER VERY SEVERE RESTRICTIONS THEY SOON MAKE RICH AND AS SOON AS THEY BECOME INDEPENDENT RETURN TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY
NEXT DAY WE SAW THE ISLAND OF MADURA ON THE TWENTY SIXTH SAW THE ISLAND OF JAVA AND ON THE THIRTIETH ANCHORED AT SAMARANG IMMEDIATELY ON OUR COMING TO ANCHOR
ON THE NORTH WEST SIDE OF GARDNER'S ISLAND ALL THIS PART
AND BIDDING HIM FAREWELL JUMPED OVER THE QUARTER INTO THE WATER THE CAPTAIN THEN FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE AND JUMPED AFTER HIM AT THAT INSTANT SHE TOOK HER LAST HEEL AND WHILE EVERY ONE WERE SCRAMBLING TO WINDWARD SHE SUNK
WE VIEWED THE RELICS OF LORD CATHCART WE MET NOTHING PARTICULAR IN PASSING THE ISLAND OF SUMATRA BUT EXPERIENCED GREAT DEATH AND SICKNESS IN GOING THROUGH THE STRAITS OF SUNDA
IN THE MORNING AT DAY LIGHT WE PUT ABOUT TO EXAMINE THE DANGER WE WERE IN AND FOUND WE HAD GOT EMBAYED IN A DOUBLE REEF WHICH WILL VERY SOON BE AN ISLAND
THEY HAVE EVEN CONTRIVED TO CARRY CANALS TO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN THE BOORS OR COUNTRY FARMERS ARE A SPECIES OF THE HUMAN RACE
EAST INDIAMAN WHO SPOKE ENGLISH HEARING OF THE ARRIVAL OF CAPTAIN EDWARDS AND OUR UNFORTUNATE BOAT RUN TO THEM WITH THE GLAD TIDINGS OF THEIR CAPTAIN HAVING ARRIVED BUT ONE OF THEM STARTING UP IN SURPRISE SAID
THE TOWN IS GAY AND FROM LENGTH OF HABIT THE INHABITANTS PARTAKE
STANDARDS AND STANDARD BEARERS WERE PRESENT WHEN THE CORPSE
WERE EMPLOYED THRUMBING A TOPSAIL TO HAUL UNDER HER BOTTOM TO ENDEAVOUR TO FODDER HER TO ADD TO OUR DISTRESS AT THIS JUNCTURE ONE OF THE CHAIN PUMPS GAVE WAY AND SHE GAINED FAST UPON US
AND AS THIS MERCIFUL ESCAPE WAS FROM THE VIGILANCE OF ONE WELLS WHO WAS LOOKING OUT AHEAD IT WAS CALLED WELLS'S SHOALS THOSE HAIR BREADTH ESCAPES MAY POINT OUT THE PROPRIETY OF A CONSORT
WERE DISTINCTLY SEEN BY US SHE WAS REASONABLY SOON EXPECTED ON BOARD WE NOW SOUNDED BUT HAD NO BOTTOM WITH A HUNDRED AND TEN FATHOM LINE TILL PAST SEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE GOT GROUND IN FIFTY FATHOM
AND AS SOON AS THEY MAKE THEIR FORTUNE THEY GO HOME LET THE AMATEURS OF THE REPUBLICAN SYSTEM READ AND LEARN BE NOT SURPRISED
AS HE WAS PRECEDED BY MUSIC AND COLOURS FLYING EVERY ONE TURNED OUT TO SEE HIM AMONGST THE REST WAS A CAPTIVE KING IN CHAINS WHO WAS EMPLOYED BLOWING THE BELLOWS TO OUR ARMOURER
TO WHICH THE NAME OF MURRAY'S ISLANDS WAS GIVEN
DURING OUR FIVE WEEKS STAY HERE THE GOVERNOR MYNHEER VANION BY EVERY ACT OF POLITENESS AND ATTENTION ENDEAVOURED TO MAKE US SPEND OUR TIME AGREEABLY WE WERE SUMPTUOUSLY REGALED AT HIS TABLE EVERY DAY
IT IS NOT THE CLIMATE I AM INVEIGHING AGAINST IT IS THE GOTHIC DIABOLICAL IDEAS OF THE PEOPLE I INDITE WERE THEY ONLY DUTCHMEN WHO SUPPLIED THE RAVENOUS MAW OF DEATH IT WOULD BE
HAS A MOST BARREN ASPECT THERE WERE EVIDENT MARKS OF VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS HAVING HAPPENED THE VERY SINGULAR APPEARANCE WHICH THIS PART OF THE ISLAND PRESENTED I CANNOT OMIT MENTIONING IT BORE THE FIGURE OF A PIECE OF FLAT TABLE LAND
IS RECKONED NEXT TO BATAVIA AND IS SO LUCRATIVE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS CHANGED EVERY FIVE YEARS THE PRESENT GOVERNOR'S NAME IS OVERSTRAATEN A GENTLEMAN OF SPLENDID TASTE AND UNBOUNDED HOSPITALITY
A REGIMENT OF THE DUKE OF WIRTEMBURG IS DOING DUTY HERE AMONGST WHOM WERE SEVERAL MEN OF RANK AND FASHION WHO SHEWED US
THAT THE ANCHOR ON OUR BOW WAS UNDER WATER
THE SOUND ITSELF WAS CALLED CURTIS'S SOUND UNDER THE GENERAL DENOMINATION OF HOWE'S ISLANDS WERE INCLUDED
BY THE SMALLNESS OF THE WINDOWS
GOT SOME PROVISIONS HERE BUT FOUND THE WATER BRACKISH ON THE TWENTY NINTH WE ANCHORED AGAIN IN THE ROAD OF ANAMOOKA WE WERE SORRY TO HEAR THE TENDER HAD NOT BEEN THERE ON THE FIFTH OF AUGUST WE AGAIN PROCEEDED ON OUR VOYAGE
THE IMPETUOSITY IMAGINABLE ON A SAVAGE SHORE ABOUT SEVEN MILES
BEFORE HE LEFT US IT WAS JUDGED NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD TAKE WITH HIM AN AXE SOME FUEL PROVISIONS A LITTLE WATER AND A COMPASS PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE IT WAS NOW THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF AUGUST
WE WERE NOW CONVINCED THAT WE WERE FURTHER TO THE WESTWARD THAN WE IMAGINED AND THEREFORE SHAPED A COURSE TO FALL IN TO THE EASTWARD OF WALLIS'S ISLAND AND NEXT DAY FELL IN WITH IT
IN THE TORPID PHRASEOLOGY OF THE LOG WITH DITTO REPEATED
TWO SMALL WINE GLASSES OF WATER A DAY TO EACH MAN FOR SIXTEEN DAYS A SAW AND HAMMER HAD FORTUNATELY BEEN IN ONE OF THE BOATS WHICH ENABLED US WITH THE GREATER EXPEDITION TO MAKE
WAS VALUABLE AND CONVENIENT TO THE DUTCH BUT FROM THE VAST EXTENT OF TERRITORY LATELY ACQUIRED IN INDIA WE HAVE PLENTY OF THAT COMMODITY WITHOUT GOING TO THE DUTCH MARKET CLOSE TO THE DUTCH TOWN IS A CHINESE TOWN AND TEMPLE
STRUCK ON A REEF OF ROCKS AND AT THAT INSTANT THE BOAT GOT ON BOARD EVERY POSSIBLE EFFORT WAS ATTEMPTED TO GET HER OFF BY THE SAILS
IN WHICH SAMARANG IS BUILT IT IS GAUDY AND CALCULATED TO PLEASE THE GENERALITY OF OBSERVERS ALLOW ME TO MENTION THE SINGULAR MANNER IN WHICH THE MONKEYS
SHE STOOD UP IN THE HIGH WAGON TO SEE EVERYTHING AND WHEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN SHE TOOK FAST HOLD OF MY HAND HADN'T YOU BETTER URGE THE HORSE A LITTLE ALMIRY SHE ASKED HE'S HAD IT EASY AS WE CAME ALONG
TWILL BRING OUT A GOOD MANY OF THE OLD FOLKS TIS SUCH A LOVELY DAY I'M ALWAYS GLAD NOT TO HAVE THEM DISAPPOINTED
I ACCUSTOMED MYSELF TO PLAIN FACTS ON THE INSTANT AND WE SAID GOOD MORNING LIKE OLD FRIENDS THE BASKET WAS REALLY HEAVY AND I PUT THE HOE THROUGH ITS HANDLE AND OFFERED HIM ONE END
I TOLD HIM ONCE THE COUNTRY'D LOST A GREAT GENERAL AN I MEANT IT TOO I EXPECT YOU'RE NEAR RIGHT SAID MISSUS CAPLIN A LITTLE CRESTFALLEN AND APOLOGETIC I BE RIGHT INSISTED MISSUS TODD WITH MUCH
TWOULDN'T HURT HER TO SIT DOWN AN HEAR HIS GREAT STORIES ONCE IN A WHILE THE STORIES ARE VERY INTERESTING I VENTURED TO SAY YES YOU ALWAYS CATCH YOURSELF A THINKIN WHAT IF THEY ALL WAS TRUE AND HE HAD THE RIGHT OF IT
BEFORE ME MOST BUSINESSLIKE AND INTENT UPON HIS ERRAND WE WENT FROM THE UPPER EDGE OF THE FIELD ABOVE THE HOUSE INTO A SMOOTH BROWN PATH AMONG THE DARK SPRUCES THE HOT SUN BROUGHT OUT THE FRAGRANCE OF THE PITCHY BARK
THE BIRDS FLEW UP OUT OF THE THICK SECOND CROP OF CLOVER AND THE BEES HUMMED
SMALL COMPANIES WERE CONTINUALLY COMING UP THE LONG GREEN SLOPE FROM THE WATER AND NEARLY ALL THE BOATS HAD COME TO SHORE
YET STILL BE HEARD WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A COMPANY OF ANCIENT GREEKS GOING TO CELEBRATE A VICTORY OR TO WORSHIP THE GOD OF HARVESTS IN THE GROVE ABOVE IT WAS STRANGELY MOVING TO SEE THIS AND TO MAKE PART OF IT
THERE WAS A THICK GROWTH OF DARK PINES AND FIRS WITH AN OCCASIONAL MAPLE OR OAK THAT GAVE A GLEAM OF COLOR LIKE A BRIGHT WINDOW IN THE GREAT ROOF ON THREE SIDES WE COULD SEE THE WATER SHINING BEHIND THE TREE TRUNKS
I COUNTED THREE OR FOUR THAT WERE BAFFLED BY THE LIGHT BREEZE BUT BEFORE LONG ALL THE BOWDENS SMALL AND GREAT SEEMED TO HAVE ASSEMBLED AND WE STARTED TO GO UP TO THE GROVE ACROSS THE FIELD
AND SOME WHO DIED IN THE WAR MOST OF THE HOME GRAVES WERE THOSE OF WOMEN WE COULD SEE NOW THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENT FOOTPATHS FROM ALONG SHORE AND ACROSS COUNTRY
THROUGH THIS PIECE OF ROUGH PASTURE RAN A HUGE SHAPE OF STONE LIKE THE GREAT BACKBONE OF AN ENORMOUS CREATURE AT THE END NEAR THE WOODS WE COULD CLIMB UP ON IT AND WALK ALONG TO THE HIGHEST POINT
IN ALL THESE THERE WERE STRAGGLING PROCESSIONS WALKING IN SINGLE FILE LIKE OLD ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS THERE WAS A CROWD ABOUT THE HOUSE AS IF HUGE BEES WERE SWARMING IN THE LILAC BUSHES
I ALWAYS DID THINK MARI HARRIS RESEMBLED A CHINEE MARI HARRIS WAS PRETTY AS A CHILD I REMEMBER SAID THE PLEASANT VOICE OF MISSUS BLACKETT WHO AFTER RECEIVING THE AFFECTIONATE GREETINGS OF NEARLY THE WHOLE COMPANY
AS I LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE TABLES THERE WAS A GOOD CHEER A GRAVE SOBERNESS THAT SHONE WITH PLEASURE A HUMBLE DIGNITY OF BEARING THERE WERE SOME WHO SHOULD HAVE SAT BELOW THE SALT FOR LACK OF THIS GOOD BREEDING
THAT HE WAS LARGE AND STOUT LIKE HIS SISTER ALMIRA TODD AND STRANGE TO SAY MY FANCY HAD LED ME TO PICTURE HIM NOT FAR FROM THIRTY AND A LITTLE LOUTISH IT WAS NECESSARY INSTEAD TO PAY WILLIAM THE RESPECT DUE TO AGE
AND WENT TO BOSTON TO VOLUNTEER BUT HE AIN'T A SOUND MAN AN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE HIM THEY SAY HE KNOWS ALL THEIR TACTICS AN CAN TELL ALL ABOUT THE BATTLE O WATERLOO WELL'S HE CAN BUNKER HILL
I SEE EM BETTER NOW THEY'RE ALL SETTIN DOWN SHE SAID WITH SATISFACTION
BUT WITH A GRAND MILITARY SORT OF COURTESY AND BORE HIMSELF WITH SOLEMN DIGNITY OF IMPORTANCE WE WERE SORTED OUT ACCORDING TO SOME CLEAR DESIGN OF HIS OWN AND STOOD AS SPEECHLESS AS A TROOP TO AWAIT HIS ORDERS
WHICH WAS BUT THE REFLECTED LIGHT FROM HER BEAMING COUNTENANCE IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT I WAS FULL OF WONDER AT THE WASTE OF HUMAN ABILITY IN THIS WORLD AS A BOTANIST WONDERS AT THE WASTEFULNESS OF NATURE THE THOUSAND SEEDS THAT DIE
ON THIS NORTHERN COAST OF NEW ENGLAND WERE OF HUGUENOT BLOOD AND THAT IT IS THE NORMAN ENGLISHMAN NOT THE SAXON WHO GOES ADVENTURING TO A NEW WORLD THEY USED TO SAY IN OLD TIMES SAID MISSUS TODD MODESTLY
RIGHT FOR WILLIAM'S FISH HOUSE FIVE MILES OUT ON GREEN ISLAND OR UP THERE ON BURNT ISLAND WHERE THE SIGNAL IS HE HAD IT ALL OVER TO ME ONE DAY AN I TRIED HARD TO APPEAR INTERESTED HIS LIFE'S ALL IN IT
LAND SAKES ALIVE
GOOD FOR NOTHING ELSE MOST O HIS TIME TROUBLE IS HE I TURNED WITH INTEREST TO HEAR THE WORST MISSUS CAPLIN'S TONE WAS BOTH ZEALOUS AND IMPRESSIVE STIM'LATES SHE EXPLAINED SCORNFULLY
YOUR BABY'S IN A FIT THEY USED TO TELL THAT THE WHOLE CONGREGATION WAS UP ON ITS FEET IN A MINUTE AND RIGHT OUT INTO THE AISLES ALL THE MIS BOWDENS WAS SETTING RIGHT OUT FOR HOME
MISSUS TODD TURNED TO ME WITH A LOVELY LOOK OF TRIUMPH AND SELF FORGETFULNESS AN ELDERLY MAN WHO WORE THE LOOK OF A PROSPEROUS SEA CAPTAIN PUT UP BOTH ARMS
WITH ALMOST VOLCANIC LIGHT AND HEAT IN QUIET NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH INWARD FORCE DOES NOT WASTE ITSELF UPON THOSE PETTY EXCITEMENTS OF EVERY DAY THAT BELONG TO CITIES
TURNED AWAY TO HIDE THE FEELINGS SHE COULD NOT INSTANTLY CONTROL WHO WAS THE MARSHAL I HASTENED TO ASK WAS HE AN OLD SOLDIER DON'T HE DO WELL ANSWERED MISSUS TODD WITH SATISFACTION
HAD MADE HIS HOME THERE AND IT WAS STILL THE BOWDEN FARM FIVE GENERATIONS OF SAILORS AND FARMERS AND SOLDIERS HAD BEEN ITS CHILDREN AND PRESENTLY MISSUS BLACKETT
AND OH LOOK DOWN ON THE BAY YES LOOK DOWN ON THE BAY SEE WHAT A SIGHT O BOATS ALL HEADIN FOR THE BOWDEN PLACE COVE OH AIN'T IT BEAUTIFUL SAID MISSUS BLACKETT WITH ALL THE DELIGHT OF A GIRL
THERE WAS A FLASHING OF WHITE GULLS OVER THE WATER WHERE THE FLEET OF BOATS RODE THE LOW WAVES TOGETHER IN THE COVE SWAYING THEIR SMALL MASTS AS IF THEY KEPT TIME TO OUR STEPS
ONE CORNER WAS ALREADY DUG AND I CHOSE A FAT LOOKING HILL WHERE THE TOPS WERE WELL WITHERED THERE IS ALL THE PLEASURE THAT ONE CAN HAVE IN GOLD DIGGING IN FINDING ONE'S HOPES SATISFIED IN THE RICHES OF A GOOD HILL OF POTATOES
NO SANTIN NEVER WAS IN THE WAR SAID MISSUS TODD WITH LOFTY INDIFFERENCE IT WAS A CAUSE OF REAL DISTRESS TO HIM HE KEP ENLISTIN AND TRAVELED FAR AN WIDE ABOUT HERE AN EVEN TOOK THE BO'T
HE COULDN'T DO NOTHIN WITH EM ALL HE THINKS OF WHEN HE SEES A CROWD IS HOW TO MARCH EM TIS ALL VERY WELL WHEN HE DON'T TEMPT TOO MUCH HE NEVER DID ACT LIKE OTHER FOLKS
I REMEMBER THE DAY I PROMISED TO NATHAN HOW IT COME OVER ME
AND THERE WON'T BE A THING SHE'LL EVER REGRET EXCEPT TO MOURN BECAUSE WILLIAM WA'N'T HERE MISSUS BLACKETT HAVING BEEN PROPERLY ESCORTED TO THE HOUSE MISSUS TODD RECEIVED HER OWN FULL SHARE OF HONOR AND SOME OF THE MEN
HE WAS ABLE TO PURSUE THEM WITH MORE OR LESS PLEASURE HE WAS ABOUT SIXTY AND NOT YOUNG LOOKING FOR HIS YEARS
IN MONGST THE CLIMBIN' BEANS SHE SMILED
HE DON'T OFTEN HAVE SUCH A CHANCE TO SHOW OFF HIS GIFTS SAID MISSUS CAPLIN A FRIEND FROM THE LANDING WHO HAD JOINED US THAT'S SANT BOWDEN HE ALWAYS TAKES THE LEAD SUCH DAYS
EXCLAIMED MISSUS TODD WITH UNAFFECTED DELIGHT AND THESE KINDRED SPIRITS MET AND PARTED WITH THE PROMISE OF A GOOD TALK LATER ON AFTER THIS
THEN WE MOVED EASILY TOWARD THE HOUSE TOGETHER SPEAKING OF THE FINE WEATHER AND OF MACKEREL WHICH WERE REPORTED TO BE STRIKING IN ALL ABOUT THE BAY WILLIAM HAD BEEN OUT SINCE THREE O'CLOCK AND HAD TAKEN AN EXTRA FARE OF FISH
THE OLD BOWDEN HOUSE STOOD LOW STORIED AND BROAD ROOFED IN ITS GREEN FIELDS AS IF IT WERE A MOTHERLY BROWN HEN WAITING FOR THE FLOCK THAT CAME STRAYING TOWARD IT FROM EVERY DIRECTION THE FIRST BOWDEN SETTLER
SHE ADDED WISTFULLY WE ALWAYS HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER WHY IF IT IS A GOOD PLEASANT DAY TOMORROW
THERE WAS NO MORE TIME FOR CONVERSATION UNTIL WE WERE SEATED IN ORDER AT THE LONG TABLES I'M ONE THAT ALWAYS DREADS SEEING SOME O THE FOLKS THAT I DON'T LIKE AT SUCH A TIME AS THIS
I DO TRY TO REMEMBER THAT SHE'S NATHAN'S COUSIN OH DEAR WELL SHE'S GONE BY AFTER ALL AN AIN'T SEEN ME I EXPECTED SHE'D COME PLEASANTIN ROUND JUST TO SHOW OFF AN SAY AFTERWARDS SHE WAS ACQUAINTED
WAS ALL SETTING IN MEETING A DREADFUL HOT SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND A SCATTER WITTED LITTLE BOUND GIRL CAME RUNNING TO THE MEETIN' HOUSE DOOR ALL OUT O BREATH FROM SOMEWHERES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD MIS BOWDEN MIS BOWDEN
NEVER'D LOOK SO DISCONSOLATE IF SHE WAS ANY SORT OF A PROPER PERSON TO DIRECT THINGS SHE MIGHT DIVERT HIM YES SHE MIGHT DIVERT THE OLD GENTLEMAN AN LET HIM THINK HE HAD HIS OWN WAY STEAD O ARGUING EVERYTHING DOWN TO THE BARE BONE
SOMEBODY OBSERVED ONCE THAT YOU COULD PICK OUT THE LIKENESS OF MOST EVERY SORT OF A FOREIGNER WHEN YOU LOOKED ABOUT YOU IN OUR PARISH SAID SISTER CAPLIN HER FACE BRIGHTENING WITH SUDDEN ILLUMINATION I DIDN'T SEE THE BEARIN OF IT THEN QUITE SO PLAIN
WHICH THE BOYS AND GIRLS MADE WE BROUGHT FLOWERS FROM THE FENCE THICKETS OF THE GREAT FIELD AND OUT OF THE DISORDER OF FLOWERS AND PROVISIONS SUDDENLY APPEARED AS ORDERLY A SCHEME FOR THE FEAST AS THE MARSHAL HAD SHAPED FOR THE PROCESSION
WHILE EVERYBODY CROWDED ROUND TO GIVE THEIR WELCOME MOTHER'S ALWAYS THE QUEEN SAID MISSUS TODD YES THEY'LL ALL MAKE EVERYTHING OF MOTHER SHE'LL HAVE A LOVELY TIME TO DAY I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD HER MISS IT
THERE NEVER WAS A MORE GENEROUS OUT OF DOOR FEAST ALONG THE COAST THEN THE BOWDEN FAMILY SET FORTH THAT DAY TO CALL IT A PICNIC WOULD MAKE IT SEEM TRIVIAL
IN BOTH HER APPEARANCE AND HER CHARMING GIFTS
THE UNUSED PROVISION OF EVERY SORT THE RESERVE FORCE OF SOCIETY GROWS MORE AND MORE AMAZING TO ONE'S THOUGHT MORE THAN ONE FACE AMONG THE BOWDENS SHOWED THAT ONLY OPPORTUNITY AND STIMULUS WERE LACKING
HAS SUCH A POWER OF SURVIVAL THAT I FELT ALL THE TIME AS IF ONE MUST TRY TO MAKE THE OCCASION EASY FOR SOME ONE WHO WAS YOUNG AND NEW TO THE AFFAIRS OF SOCIAL LIFE HE ASKED POLITELY IF I WOULD LIKE TO GO UP TO THE GREAT LEDGE
THAT ANY OCCASION OF GENERAL INTEREST PROVES TO BE LESS THAN GREAT SUCH IS THE HIDDEN FIRE OF ENTHUSIASM IN THE NEW ENGLAND NATURE THAT ONCE GIVEN AN OUTLET IT SHINES FORTH
AMIABILITY TWAS MOST TOO BAD TO CRAMP HIM DOWN TO HIS PEACEFUL TRADE BUT HE'S A MOST EXCELLENT SHOEMAKER AT HIS BEST AN HE ALWAYS SAYS IT'S A TRADE THAT GIVES HIM TIME TO THINK AN PLAN HIS MANEUVERS
SERENE AND MINDFUL OF PRIVILEGE AND RESPONSIBILITY THE MISTRESS BY SIMPLE FITNESS OF THIS GREAT DAY MISSUS TODD LOOKED UP AT THE ROOF OF GREEN TREES AND THEN CAREFULLY SURVEYED THE COMPANY
THERE SUDDENLY CAME SILENCE AND ORDER I SAW THE STRAIGHT SOLDIERLY LITTLE FIGURE OF A MAN WHO BORE A FINE RESEMBLANCE TO MISSUS BLACKETT AND WHO APPEARED TO MARSHAL US WITH PERFECT EASE HE WAS IMPERATIVE ENOUGH
I TOLD HIM I NEVER COULD LIKE HER MYSELF SAID HE YOU SHA'N'T BE BOTHERED DEAR HE SAYS AN TWAS ONE O THE THINGS THAT MADE ME SET A GOOD DEAL BY NATHAN
CONFERENCE IN PLATOONS AND GOT EM ALL FLUSTERED UP TRYIN TO SENSE HIS IDEAS OF A HOLLER SQUARE SHE BURST FORTH
I HAD BEEN NOTICING WITH GREAT INTEREST THE CURIOUSLY FRENCH TYPE OF FACE WHICH PREVAILED IN THIS RUSTIC COMPANY I HAD SAID TO MYSELF BEFORE THAT MISSUS BLACKETT WAS PLAINLY OF FRENCH DESCENT
AFTER A SEASON OF REFLECTION WE WERE JUST WAITING FOR THE FEAST TO BEGIN
STARTLED IN THE SILENCE OF THE WIDE FIELD AND SAW AN ELDERLY MAN BENT IN THE SHOULDERS AS FISHERMEN OFTEN ARE GRAY HEADED AND CLEAN SHAVEN AND WITH A TIMID AIR IT WAS WILLIAM HE LOOKED JUST LIKE HIS MOTHER AND I HAD BEEN IMAGINING
I'VE GOT NEW DOUGHNUTS DEAR SAID THE LITTLE OLD LADY
INSISTED MISSUS TODD WITH SOME EXCITEMENT
NOW THERE WAS A PLEASANT LOOK OF SHADE AND SHELTER THERE FOR THE GREAT FAMILY MEETING WE HURRIED ON OUR WAY BEGINNING TO FEEL AS IF WE WERE VERY LATE AND IT WAS A GREAT SATISFACTION
I'VE VISITED IT TIME AN AGAIN JUST TO NOTICE ITS POOR BLOOMS TIS A REAL SANT BOWDEN OUT OF ITS OWN PLACE MISSUS CAPLIN LOOKED BEWILDERED AND BLANK WELL ALL I KNOW IS
AND THEY'D BEEN TREATED TO A SERMON ON FAITH AN WORKS FROM OLD FAYTHER HARLOW THAT NEVER KNOWS WHEN TO CEASE TWA'N'T NO TIME FOR TACTICS THEN THEY WA'N'T A'THINKIN OF THE CHURCH MILITARY SANT
WE NEVER HAD FITS NONE OF US AND TWAS LUCKY WE DIDN'T WAY OUT THERE TO GREEN ISLAND NOW THESE FOLKS RIGHT IN FRONT
THE MINISTER STOOD THERE IN THE PULPIT TRYIN TO KEEP SOBER AN ALL AT ONCE HE BURST RIGHT OUT LAUGHIN HE WAS A VERY NICE MAN THEY SAID AND HE SAID HE'D BETTER GIVE EM THE BENEDICTION AND THEY COULD HEAR THE SERMON NEXT SUNDAY
OVER TO THE PORT THEY ALWAYS INVITE HIM TO MARCH DECORATION DAY SAME AS THE REST AN HE DOES LOOK NOBLE HE COMES OF SOLDIER STOCK
YES SAYS I BUT THINK O THANKSGIVIN TIMES AN FUNERALS SHE'S OUR RELATION AN WE'VE GOT TO OWN HER YOUNG FOLKS DON'T THINK O THOSE THINGS
I BEGAN TO RESPECT THE BOWDENS FOR THEIR INHERITANCE OF GOOD TASTE AND SKILL AND A CERTAIN PLEASING GIFT OF FORMALITY SOMETHING MADE THEM DO ALL THESE THINGS IN A FINER WAY THAN MOST COUNTRY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DONE THEM
AND THE SHADE WAS PLEASANT AS WE CLIMBED THE HILL WILLIAM STOPPED ONCE OR TWICE TO SHOW ME A GREAT WASPS' NEST CLOSE BY OR SOME FISHHAWKS' NESTS BELOW IN A BIT OF SWAMP
AN IT SEEMED AS IF DIE I SHOULD POOR NATHAN SAW SOMETHIN HAD CROSSED ME HE HAD VERY NICE FEELINGS
AND THE OLD HOUSE AND ITS LILACS STANDING PLACIDLY IN THE SUN AND THE GREAT BARN WITH A STOCKADE OF CARRIAGES FROM WHICH TWO OR THREE CARE TAKING MEN WHO HAD LINGERED WERE COMING ACROSS THE FIELD TOGETHER
THE BOWDEN REUNION IT IS VERY RARE IN COUNTRY LIFE
AT LAST TO TURN OUT OF THE STONY HIGHROAD INTO A GREEN LANE SHADED WITH OLD APPLE TREES MISSUS TODD ENCOURAGED THE HORSE UNTIL HE FAIRLY PRANCED WITH GAYETY AS WE DROVE ROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE ON THE SOFT TURF
I'VE HAD TO FAVOR OLD MIS EVINS WITH DRYIN YOU CAN SEE IT RIGHT IN THEIR EXPRESSIONS ALL THEM EVINS FOLKS THERE JUST YOU LOOK UP TO THE CROSSROADS MOTHER SHE SUDDENLY EXCLAIMED SEE ALL THE TEAMS AHEAD OF US
WERE FAMILIAR THINGS THE MINISTERS AND MISSUS BLACKETT WITH A FEW OF THEIR RANK AND AGE WERE PUT IN PLACES OF HONOR AND FOR ONCE THAT I LOOKED ANY OTHER WAY I LOOKED TWICE AT MISSUS BLACKETT'S FACE
CAME TO JOIN US TO SEE AS SHE INSISTED THAT WE WERE OUT OF MISCHIEF YES MARI WAS ONE O THEM PRETTY LITTLE LAMBS THAT MAKE DREADFUL HOMELY OLD SHEEP REPLIED MISSUS TODD WITH ENERGY CAP'N LITTLEPAGE
AS IF FROM THE INEXHAUSTIBLE BURNING HEART OF THE EARTH THE PRIMAL FIRES BREAK THROUGH THE GRANITE DUST IN WHICH OUR SOULS ARE SET EACH HEART IS WARM AND EVERY FACE SHINES WITH THE ANCIENT LIGHT
AND FEEL THE COOL SALT BREEZE
SAID MISSUS TODD WITH AN ALARMING TRANSITION FROM GENERAL OPINIONS TO PARTICULAR ANIMOSITIES I HATE HER JUST THE SAME AS I ALWAYS DID
SHOWED ME THE STONE WALLED BURYING GROUND THAT STOOD LIKE A LITTLE FORT ON A KNOLL OVERLOOKING THE BAY BUT AS SHE SAID THERE WERE PLENTY OF SCATTERED BOWDENS WHO WERE NOT LAID THERE SOME LOST AT SEA AND SOME OUT WEST
SO HE KEPT IT OVER MY MOTHER WAS THERE AND SHE THOUGHT CERTAIN TWAS ME NONE OF OUR FAMILY WAS EVER SUBJECT TO FITS INTERRUPTED MISSUS TODD SEVERELY NO
THE SKY THE SEA HAVE WATCHED POOR HUMANITY AT ITS RITES SO LONG WE WERE NO MORE A NEW ENGLAND FAMILY CELEBRATING ITS OWN EXISTENCE AND SIMPLE PROGRESS
THIS WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM MISSUS TODD'S USUAL LARGENESS OF MIND THAT I HAD A MOMENT'S UNEASINESS BUT THE CLOUD PASSED QUICKLY OVER HER SPIRIT AND WAS GONE WITH THE OFFENDER
AND LENDS SOME BEAUTY TO THE PLAINEST FACE OH I EXPECT I SHALL MEET FRIENDS TODAY THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN IN A LONG WHILE SAID MISSUS BLACKETT WITH DEEP SATISFACTION
WORE A LOOK OF TROUBLE AND I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE TEASING SPIRIT OF ALMIRA IT WAS TOO PLEASANT TO STAY INDOORS ALTOGETHER EVEN IN SUCH REWARDING COMPANIONSHIP BESIDES I MIGHT MEET WILLIAM
AND LIFTED MISSUS BLACKETT DOWN FROM THE HIGH WAGON LIKE A CHILD AND KISSED HER WITH HEARTY AFFECTION I WAS MASTER AFRAID SHE WOULDN'T BE HERE HE SAID LOOKING AT MISSUS TODD WITH A FACE LIKE A HAPPY SUNBURNT SCHOOLBOY
AND HE CAN REST WHEN WE GET THERE THE OTHERS ARE SOME LITTLE WAYS AHEAD AND I DON'T WANT TO LOSE A MINUTE WE WATCHED THE BOATS DROP THEIR SAILS ONE BY ONE IN THE COVE AS WE DROVE ALONG THE HIGH LAND
EVEN THE CHILDREN WERE READY TO MARCH TOGETHER A PRETTY FLOCK AND AT THE LAST MOMENT MISSUS BLACKETT AND A FEW DISTINGUISHED COMPANIONS THE MINISTERS AND THOSE WHO WERE VERY OLD CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE TOGETHER AND TOOK THEIR PLACES
THAT OUR FAMILY CAME OF VERY HIGH FOLKS IN FRANCE AND ONE OF EM WAS A GREAT GENERAL IN SOME O THE OLD WARS I SOMETIMES THINK THAT SANTIN'S ABILITY HAS COME WAY DOWN FROM THEN TAIN'T NOTHIN HE'S EVER ACQUIRED
I EXPECT YOU MIGHT HAVE CHOSE A SOMEWHAT LARGER FISH BUT I'LL TRY AN MAKE IT DO I SHALL HAVE TO HAVE A FEW EXTRA POTATOES BUT THERE'S A FIELD FULL OUT THERE AN THE HOE'S LEANIN AGAINST THE WELL HOUSE
SHE HAD SIMPLY GROWN SLUGGISH FOR LACK OF PROPER SURROUNDINGS SHE WAS NOT SO MUCH REMINISCENT NOW AS EXPECTANT AND AS ALERT AND GAY AS A GIRL WE WHO WERE HER NEIGHBORS WERE FULL OF GAYETY
HE PICKED A FEW SPRIGS OF LATE BLOOMING LINNAEA AS WE CAME OUT UPON AN OPEN BIT OF PASTURE AT THE TOP OF THE ISLAND AND GAVE THEM TO ME WITHOUT SPEAKING BUT HE KNEW AS WELL AS I THAT ONE COULD NOT SAY HALF HE WISHED ABOUT LINNAEA
SUCH WAS THE INNOCENCE AND SIMPLICITY OF THE MOMENT THAT WHEN I HEARD MISSUS TODD LAUGHING BEHIND US IN THE KITCHEN I LAUGHED TOO BUT WILLIAM DID NOT EVEN BLUSH I THINK HE WAS A LITTLE DEAF AND HE STEPPED ALONG
AND STRAYING OUT PRESENTLY I FOUND THE HOE BY THE WELL HOUSE AND AN OLD SPLINT BASKET AT THE WOODSHED DOOR AND ALSO FOUND MY WAY DOWN TO THE FIELD WHERE THERE WAS A GREAT SQUARE PATCH OF ROUGH WEEDY POTATO TOPS AND TALL RAGWEED
THAT WHEN YOU CALL UPON THE BOWDENS YOU MAY EXPECT MOST FAMILIES TO RISE UP BETWEEN THE LANDING AND THE FAR END OF THE BACK COVE THOSE THAT AREN'T KIN BY BLOOD ARE KIN BY MARRIAGE
MISSUS TODD HAD TAKEN OFF HER WARM GLOVES AND LOOKED THE PICTURE OF CONTENT THERE SHE EXCLAIMED I'VE ALWAYS MEANT TO HAVE YOU SEE THIS PLACE BUT I NEVER LOOKED FOR SUCH A BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY
WE CARRIED THE TOKENS AND INHERITANCE OF ALL SUCH HOUSEHOLDS FROM WHICH THIS HAD DESCENDED AND WERE ONLY THE LATEST OF OUR LINE WE POSSESSED THE INSTINCTS OF A FAR FORGOTTEN CHILDHOOD
BUT THEY WERE NOT MANY SO I SAID TO MYSELF THEIR ANCESTORS MAY HAVE SAT IN THE GREAT HALL OF SOME OLD FRENCH HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN BATTLES AND SIEGES AND PROCESSIONS AND FEASTS
THERE THEY'RE CALLIN OUT IT'S TIME TO SET THE TABLES SAID MISSUS CAPLIN WITH GREAT EXCITEMENT HERE'S COUSIN SARAH JANE BLACKETT WELL I AM PLEASED CERTAIN
JUST AS THERE IS PLANTS CONTINUED MISSUS TODD WHO WAS NOTHING IF NOT BOTANICAL I KNOW OF JUST ONE SPRIG OF LAUREL THAT GROWS OVER BACK HERE IN A WILD SPOT
BUT WHEN AT LONG INTERVALS THE ALTARS TO PATRIOTISM TO FRIENDSHIP TO THE TIES OF KINDRED ARE REARED IN OUR FAMILIAR FIELDS THEN THE FIRES GLOW THE FLAMES COME UP
THERE USED TO BE AN OLD STORY GOIN ABOUT WHEN I WAS A GIRL SAID MISSUS BLACKETT WITH MUCH AMUSEMENT THERE WAS A GREAT MANY MORE BOWDENS THEN THAN THERE ARE NOW AND THE FOLKS
OUT OF THE CHATTERING CROWD OF NOISY CHILDREN AND LARGE WAISTED WOMEN WHOSE BEST BLACK DRESSES FELL STRAIGHT TO THE GROUND IN GENEROUS FOLDS AND SUNBURNT MEN WHO LOOKED AS SERIOUS AS IF IT WERE TOWN MEETING DAY
AN I NEVER COULD HEAR OF NO OTHER ON THIS COAST I HAD A LARGE BUNCH BROUGHT ME ONCE FROM MASSACHUSETTS WAY SO I KNOW IT THIS PIECE GROWS IN AN OPEN SPOT WHERE YOU'D THINK TWOULD DO WELL BUT IT'S SORT O POOR LOOKIN
WHILE DINNER WAS GETTING READY SO NOT WITHOUT A DEEP SENSE OF PLEASURE AND A DELIGHTED LOOK OF SURPRISE FROM THE TWO HOSTESSES WE STARTED WILLIAM AND I AS IF BOTH OF US FELT MUCH YOUNGER THAN WE LOOKED
AIN'T I JUST BEEN MAINTAININ THAT HE AIN'T LIKE EM URGED MISSUS TODD DECIDEDLY STRANGE FOLKS HAS GOT TO HAVE STRANGE WAYS FOR WHAT I SEE
I COULD PLAINLY HEAR HER GREET HIM GOT ROUND TO COMIN IN DIDN'T YOU SHE INQUIRED WITH AMUSEMENT WELL NOW THAT'S CLEVER DIDN'T KNOW'S I SHOULD SEE YOU TO DAY WILLIAM AN I WANTED TO SETTLE AN ACCOUNT
THERE WAS AN INSTANT CRY OF REJOICING AND TWO OR THREE PERSONS RAN TOWARD US FROM THE BUSY GROUP WHY DEAR MIS BLACKETT HERE'S MIS BLACKETT I HEARD THEM SAY AS IF IT WERE PLEASURE ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY TO HAVE A SIGHT OF HER
STEALING A GLANCE AT ME THERE'S ONE THING CERTAIN THERE'S NOTHING TAKES IN THIS WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE ANYTHING RELATED TO THE BOWDENS YES I DO FEEL
BEYOND THE FIELDS AND COVE A HIGHER POINT OF LAND RAN OUT INTO THE BAY COVERED WITH WOODS WHICH MUST HAVE KEPT AWAY MUCH OF THE NORTHWEST WIND IN WINTER
I WAS SURE THAT MISSUS BLACKETT MUST BE WAITING IMPATIENTLY TO SLICE THE POTATOES INTO THE CHOWDER LAYER AFTER LAYER WITH THE FISH YOU LET ME TAKE HOLT O THAT BASKET MA'AM SAID THE PLEASANT ANXIOUS VOICE BEHIND ME I TURNED
AND IN HER LARGE EYES WROUGHT A MIXTURE OF SENSATIONS MIGHT BE SCANN'D OF HALF VOLUPTUOUSNESS AND HALF COMMAND HER FORM HAD ALL THE SOFTNESS OF HER SEX
YET SOMEHOW THERE WAS SOMETHING SOMEWHERE WANTING AS IF SHE RATHER ORDER'D THAN WAS GRANTING
LOVE LIKE RELIGION SOMETIMES RUNS TO HERESY THIS MONSTROUS TALE HAD PROBABLY ITS SOURCE FOR SUCH EXAGGERATIONS HERE AND THERE I SEE IN WRITING COURSER BY MISTAKE FOR COURIER
SOME BY FEATURES ARE BOUGHT UP OTHERS BY A WARLIKE LEADER
AND CONSCIENCE ASK A CURIOUS SORT OF QUESTION ABOUT THE RIGHT DIVINE HOW FAR WE SHOULD SELL FLESH AND BLOOD WHEN DINNER HAS OPPREST ONE I THINK IT IS PERHAPS THE GLOOMIEST HOUR WHICH TURNS UP OUT OF THE SAD TWENTY FOUR
IT WOULD STRIKE YOU BLIND COULD I DO JUSTICE TO THE FULL DETAIL SO LUCKILY FOR BOTH MY PHRASES FAIL THUS MUCH HOWEVER I MAY ADD HER YEARS WERE RIPE
POOR FELLOW FOR SOME REASON SURELY BAD THEY HAD SLAIN HIM WITH FIVE SLUGS AND LEFT HIM THERE TO PERISH ON THE PAVEMENT
ALL FEELINGS CHANGED BUT THIS WAS LAST TO VARY A SPELL FROM WHICH EVEN YET I AM NOT QUITE FREE BUT I GROW SAD AND LET A TALE GROW COLD WHICH MUST NOT BE PATHETICALLY TOLD
BECAUSE IF DROWN'D THEY CAN'T IF SPARED THEY WON'T
AS IS A SLAVE BY HIS INTENDED BIDDER T IS PLEASANT PURCHASING OUR FELLOW CREATURES AND ALL ARE TO BE SOLD IF YOU CONSIDER THEIR PASSIONS AND ARE DEXT'ROUS
I THEREFORE DO DENOUNCE ALL AMOROUS WRITING EXCEPT IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT TO ATTRACT PLAIN SIMPLE SHORT AND BY NO MEANS INVITING BUT WITH A MORAL TO EACH ERROR TACK'D
AS EELS ARE TO BE FLAY'D
A NEAT SNUG STUDY ON A WINTER'S NIGHT
DESCRIPTION IS MY FORTE BUT EVERY FOOL DESCRIBES IN THESE BRIGHT DAYS HIS WONDROUS JOURNEY TO SOME FOREIGN COURT AND SPAWNS HIS QUARTO AND DEMANDS YOUR PRAISE DEATH TO HIS PUBLISHER TO HIM T IS SPORT
SHE HAS SERVED ME ALSO MUCH THE SAME AS YOU EXCEPT THAT I HAVE FOUND IT NOTHING NEW
SOME FAINT LAMPS GLEAMING FROM THE LOFTY WALLS GAVE LIGHT ENOUGH TO HINT THEIR FARTHER WAY BUT NOT ENOUGH TO SHOW THE IMPERIAL HALLS IN ALL THE FLASHING OF THEIR FULL ARRAY
THEY WITH THEIR ROUGH FACES THRONG'D ABOUT THE BED TO GAZE ONCE MORE ON THE COMMANDING CLAY WHICH FOR THE LAST THOUGH NOT THE FIRST TIME BLED AND SUCH AN END
FLANK'D BY LARGE GROVES WHICH TOWER'D ON EITHER HAND THEY ALMOST LOST THEIR WAY AND HAD TO PICK IT FOR NIGHT WAS DOSING ERE THEY CAME TO LAND THE EUNUCH MADE A SIGN TO THOSE ON BOARD WHO ROW'D OFF LEAVING THEM WITHOUT A WORD
IT CHANCED AMONGST THE OTHER PEOPLE LOTTED A MAN OF THIRTY RATHER STOUT AND HALE WITH RESOLUTION IN HIS DARK
BABA PROPOSED THAT HE SHOULD KISS THE HAND HERE WAS AN HONOURABLE COMPROMISE A HALF WAY HOUSE OF DIPLOMATIC REST WHERE THEY MIGHT MEET IN MUCH MORE PEACEFUL GUISE
THE TRUMP AND BUGLE TILL HE SPAKE WERE DUMB
HE CHOSE HIMSELF TO POINT OUT WHAT HE THOUGHT MOST PROPER FOR THE CHRISTIANS HE HAD BOUGHT THE SUIT HE THOUGHT MOST SUITABLE TO EACH WAS FOR THE ELDER AND THE STOUTER FIRST A CANDIOTE CLOAK
MUCH FITTED FOR INSPIRING MARVEL AND PRAISE FOR BOTH OR NONE THINGS WIN AND I MUST SAY I NE'ER COULD SEE THE VERY GREAT HAPPINESS OF THE NIL ADMIRARI NOT TO ADMIRE IS ALL THE ART I KNOW
AND SUCH COMFORTABLE QUARTERS TO BE PUT UP FOR AUCTION AMONGST TARTARS WERE THINGS TO SHAKE A STOIC NE'ERTHELESS UPON THE WHOLE HIS CARRIAGE WAS SERENE HIS FIGURE
SOME SPEAKERS WHINE AND OTHERS LAY THE LASH ON BUT MORE OR LESS CONTINUE STILL TO TEASE ON WITH ARGUMENTS ACCORDING TO THEIR FORTE
AS THOUGH THEY WERE IN A MERE CHRISTIAN FAIR CHEAPENING AN OX AN ASS A LAMB OR KID SO THAT THEIR BARGAIN SOUNDED LIKE A BATTLE FOR THIS SUPERIOR YOKE OF HUMAN CATTLE
BUT YESTERDAY AND WHO HAD MIGHTIER BREATH A THOUSAND WARRIORS BY HIS WORD WERE KEPT IN AWE HE SAID AS THE CENTURION SAITH GO AND HE GOETH COME AND FORTH HE STEPP'D
SO LET US BE ACQUAINTED AS WE OUGHT
THERE WAS NO END UNTO THE THINGS SHE BOUGHT NOR TO THE TROUBLE WHICH HER FANCIES CAUSED YET EVEN HER TYRANNY HAD SUCH A GRACE
AND LOOKING ON HIM WITH A SORT OF SMILE TOOK LEAVE WITH SUCH A FACE OF SATISFACTION AS GOOD MEN WEAR WHO HAVE DONE A VIRTUOUS ACTION WHEN HE WAS GONE THERE WAS A SUDDEN CHANGE
KING OF MEN REIGN'D TILL ONE SUMMER'S DAY HE TOOK TO GRAZING AND DANIEL TAMED THE LIONS IN THEIR DEN THE PEOPLE'S AWE AND ADMIRATION RAISING
THOUGH ON MORE THOROUGH BRED OR FAIRER FINGERS NO LIPS E'ER LEFT THEIR TRANSITORY TRACE ON SUCH AS THESE THE LIP TOO FONDLY LINGERS AND FOR ONE KISS WOULD FAIN IMPRINT A BRACE
AND THE CALUMNIATED QUEEN SEMIRAMIS THAT INJURED QUEEN BY CHRONICLERS SO COARSE HAS BEEN ACCUSED I DOUBT NOT BY CONSPIRACY OF AN IMPROPER FRIENDSHIP FOR HER HORSE
HER BEAUTY OF THAT OVERPOWERING KIND WHOSE FORCE DESCRIPTION ONLY WOULD ABATE I D RATHER LEAVE IT MUCH TO YOUR OWN MIND THAN LESSEN IT BY WHAT I COULD RELATE OF FORMS AND FEATURES
I PASS MY EVENINGS IN LONG GALLERIES SOLELY AND THAT S THE REASON I M SO MELANCHOLY ALAS MAN MAKES THAT GREAT WHICH MAKES HIM LITTLE
THE LADY RISING UP WITH SUCH AN AIR AS VENUS ROSE WITH FROM THE WAVE ON THEM BENT LIKE AN ANTELOPE A PAPHIAN PAIR OF EYES WHICH PUT OUT EACH SURROUNDING GEM
AS IF WELL USED TO THE RETREATING TRADE AND
NO ONE TROUBLED HIM WITH CONVERSATION HE LEADS THEM THROUGH THE HALL AND WITHOUT STOPPING ON THROUGH A FARTHER RANGE OF GOODLY ROOMS SPLENDID BUT SILENT
TO STRIVE TOO WITH OUR FATE WERE SUCH A STRIFE AS IF THE CORN SHEAF SHOULD OPPOSE THE SICKLE MEN ARE THE SPORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES SEEM THE SPORT OF MEN
ONE SEEMS NOTHING IN DESERTS FORESTS CROWDS OR BY THE SHORE THERE SOLITUDE WE KNOW HAS HER FULL GROWTH IN THE SPOTS WHICH WERE HER REALMS FOR EVERMORE BUT IN A MIGHTY HALL OR GALLERY
HE SOON BEGAN TO SHOW A KIND OF BLUNT COMPASSION FOR THE SAD LOT OF SO YOUNG A PARTNER IN THE WOE WHICH FOR HIMSELF HE SEEM'D TO DEEM NO WORSE THAN ANY OTHER SCRAPE A THING OF COURSE
T IS TRUE IT GETS ANOTHER BRIGHT AND FRESH OR FRESHER BRIGHTER BUT THE YEAR GONE THROUGH THIS SKIN MUST GO THE WAY TOO OF ALL FLESH OR SOMETIMES ONLY WEAR A WEEK OR TWO
AS TO DISCOVER IF THEY WERE FITTED FOR THE PURPOSED CAGE NO LADY E'ER IS OGLED BY A LOVER HORSE BY A BLACKLEG BROADCLOTH BY A TAILOR
ONLY TWO AT PRESENT ABOVE GROUND
HAVE YOU NO FRIENDS
AMBITION AVARICE VENGEANCE GLORY GLUE THE GLITTERING LIME TWIGS OF OUR LATTER DAYS WHERE STILL WE FLUTTER ON FOR PENCE OR PRAISE
A SAD TALE SADDENS DOUBLY WHEN T IS LONG BUT DROOP NOT FORTUNE AT YOUR TIME OF LIFE ALTHOUGH A FEMALE MODERATELY FICKLE WILL HARDLY LEAVE YOU AS SHE S NOT YOUR WIFE FOR ANY LENGTH OF DAYS IN SUCH A PICKLE
VOLTAIRE SAYS NO
A SINGLE CRY WOULD BRING THEM ALL ABROAD T IS THEREFORE BETTER LOOKING BEFORE LEAPING
I THOUGHT OR SAID CAN THIS BE DEATH THEN WHAT IS LIFE OR DEATH SPEAK BUT HE SPOKE NOT WAKE BUT STILL HE SLEPT
TURNS UP MORE DANGEROUS BREAKERS THAN THE EUXINE
WELL THEN YOUR THIRD
TURNING ROUND YOU SCARCELY CAN BE THIRTY HAVE YOU THREE
HER FEATURES ALL THE SWEETNESS OF THE DEVIL WHEN HE PUT ON THE CHERUB TO PERPLEX EVE AND PAVED GOD KNOWS HOW THE ROAD TO EVIL THE SUN HIMSELF WAS SCARCE MORE FREE FROM SPECKS THAN SHE FROM AUGHT AT WHICH THE EYE COULD CAVIL
HER BLOOD WAS HIGH HER BEAUTY SCARCE OF EARTH JUDGE THEN IF HER CAPRICES E'ER STOOD STILL
QUITE CONSCIOUS OF HER STATION THEY TROD AS UPON NECKS AND TO COMPLETE HER STATE IT IS THE CUSTOM OF HER NATION A PONIARD DECK'D HER GIRDLE AS THE SIGN SHE WAS A SULTAN'S BRIDE
BUT HE COULD NOT STOOP TO ANY SHOE UNLESS IT SHOD THE POPE
WHICH TO THE KNEE MIGHT REACH AND TROUSERS NOT SO TIGHT THAT THEY WOULD BURST BUT SUCH AS FIT AN ASIATIC BREECH A SHAWL WHOSE FOLDS IN CASHMIRE HAD BEEN NURST SLIPPERS OF SAFFRON DAGGER RICH AND HANDY IN SHORT
FOR HIS OWN SHARE HE SAW BUT SMALL OBJECTION TO SO RESPECTABLE AN ANCIENT RITE AND AFTER SWALLOWING DOWN A SLIGHT REFECTION FOR WHICH HE OWN'D A PRESENT APPETITE
SWALLOWING A HEART BURNING SIGH HEAVEN HELP THE SCHOLAR WHOM HIS FORTUNE SENDS HERE PERHAPS WE SHALL BE ONE DAY BY AND BY REJOIN'D THE OTHER WHEN OUR BAD LUCK MENDS HERE MEANTIME YON
OF OTTOMAN PARADE I WON'T DESCRIBE
GAVE IT A SLIGHT KICK WITH HIS CHRISTIAN FOOT AND WHEN THE OLD NEGRO TOLD HIM TO GET READY REPLIED OLD GENTLEMAN I M NOT A LADY
OTHERS IN MONOSYLLABLE TALK CHATTED AND SOME SEEM'D MUCH IN LOVE WITH THEIR OWN DRESS AND DIVERS SMOKED SUPERB PIPES DECORATED WITH AMBER MOUTHS OF GREATER PRICE OR LESS AND SEVERAL STRUTTED
A GRAND SIGHT FROM OFF THE GIANT'S GRAVE TO WATCH THE PROGRESS OF THOSE ROLLING SEAS BETWEEN THE BOSPHORUS AS THEY LASH AND LAVE EUROPE AND ASIA YOU BEING QUITE AT EASE
OTHERS SLEPT AND SOME PREPARED FOR SUPPER WITH A GLASS OF RUM AS THE BLACK EUNUCH ENTER'D WITH HIS BRACE OF PURCHASED INFIDELS SOME RAISED THEIR EYES A MOMENT WITHOUT SLACKENING FROM THEIR PACE
WHO FIRST KISS'D THE HEM OF HER DEEP PURPLE ROBE AND SPEAKING LOW POINTED TO JUAN WHO REMAIN'D BELOW HER PRESENCE WAS AS LOFTY AS HER STATE
FORM'D RATHER FOR INSTRUCTING THAN DELIGHTING AND WITH ALL PASSIONS IN THEIR TURN ATTACK'D NOW IF MY PEGASUS SHOULD NOT BE SHOD ILL THIS POEM WILL BECOME A MORAL MODEL
FIRST BUT FOR ONE AND AFTER FOR THE PAIR THEY HAGGLED WRANGLED SWORE TOO SO THEY DID
BE SO GOOD AS DRESS YOURSELF AND POINTED OUT A SUIT IN WHICH A PRINCESS WITH GREAT PLEASURE WOULD ARRAY HER LIMBS
THEY LOOK'D LIKE PERSONS BEING LED TO SENTENCE WONDERING WHAT NEXT
BUT THAT OF LATE YOUR SCRIBBLERS THINK IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO REAR WHOLE HOTBEDS IN THEIR WORKS BECAUSE ONE POET TRAVELL'D MONGST THE TURKS
THE MOST BY READY CASH BUT ALL HAVE PRICES FROM CROWNS TO KICKS ACCORDING TO THEIR VICES THE EUNUCH
BUT NEVER MIND
ADDING THAT THIS WAS COMMONEST AND BEST FOR THROUGH THE SOUTH THE CUSTOM STILL COMMANDS THE GENTLEMAN TO KISS THE LADY'S HANDS AND HE ADVANCED THOUGH WITH BUT A BAD GRACE
EMBARK'D HIMSELF AND THEM
I WON'T BE BAIL FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THEY BOW'D OBEISANCE AND WITHDREW
I HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO TELL THE REASON
BUT FOR THE PAST I LOVED A MAID HE PAUSED AND HIS DARK EYE GREW FULL OF GLOOM A SINGLE TEAR UPON HIS EYELASH STAID A MOMENT AND THEN DROPP'D BUT TO RESUME
AND SOMETIMES EVEN A FAIR STRANGER'S AN ALMOST TWELVEMONTH'S CONSTANCY ENDANGERS
BUT THOSE WHO SATE NE'ER STIRR'D IN ANYWISE ONE OR TWO STARED THE CAPTIVES IN THE FACE JUST AS ONE VIEWS A HORSE TO GUESS HIS PRICE SOME NODDED TO THE NEGRO FROM THEIR STATION BUT
HERE WE ARE AND THERE WE GO BUT WHERE
THE FOREMOST IN THE CHARGE OR IN THE SALLY SHOULD NOW BE BUTCHER'D IN A CIVIC ALLEY THE SCARS OF HIS OLD WOUNDS WERE NEAR HIS NEW THOSE HONOURABLE SCARS WHICH BROUGHT HIM FAME
YES SAID THE OTHER AND WHEN DONE WHAT THEN HOW GET OUT HOW THE DEVIL GOT WE IN
THE CHARMING MARY MONTAGU I HAVE A PASSION FOR THE NAME OF MARY FOR ONCE IT WAS A MAGIC SOUND TO ME AND STILL IT HALF CALLS UP THE REALMS OF FAIRY WHERE I BEHELD WHAT NEVER WAS TO BE
AND IT MIGHT BE FROM THOUGHT OR TOIL OR STUDY AN OPEN BROW A LITTLE MARK'D WITH CARE ONE ARM HAD ON A BANDAGE RATHER BLOODY
AND WEIGHING OTHERS IN THEIR HAND AND BY MISTAKE SEQUINS WITH PARAS JUMBLING UNTIL THE SUM WAS ACCURATELY SCANN'D AND THEN THE MERCHANT GIVING CHANGE AND SIGNING RECEIPTS IN FULL BEGAN TO THINK OF DINING
IF THEY WOULD CONDESCEND TO CIRCUMCISION FOR HIS OWN PART HE REALLY SHOULD REJOICE TO SEE THEM TRUE BELIEVERS BUT NO LESS WOULD LEAVE HIS PROPOSITION TO THEIR CHOICE
THEY MIGHT MAKE SIX AND TWENTY SPRINGS BUT THERE ARE FORMS WHICH TIME TO TOUCH FORBEARS AND TURNS ASIDE HIS SCYTHE TO VULGAR THINGS SUCH AS WAS MARY'S QUEEN OF SCOTS
WHAT THE DEVIL SHALL I DO WITH ALL THIS GAUZE THUS HE PROFANELY TERM'D THE FINEST LACE WHICH E'ER SET OFF A MARRIAGE MORNING FACE
AT LAST THEY REACH'D A QUARTER MOST RETIRED WHERE ECHO WOKE AS IF FROM A LONG SLUMBER
BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW IT BETTERS PRESENT TIMES WITH ME OR YOU NO QUOTH THE OTHER YET YOU WILL ALLOW BY SETTING THINGS IN THEIR RIGHT POINT OF VIEW KNOWLEDGE AT LEAST IS GAIN'D FOR INSTANCE NOW
WHY REPLIED THE OTHER WHAT CAN A MAN DO THERE STILL ARE MANY RAINBOWS IN YOUR SKY BUT MINE HAVE VANISH'D ALL WHEN LIFE IS NEW COMMENCE WITH FEELINGS WARM AND PROSPECTS HIGH
THUS HORACE WROTE WE ALL KNOW LONG AGO AND THUS POPE QUOTES THE PRECEPT TO RE TEACH FROM HIS TRANSLATION BUT HAD NONE ADMIRED WOULD POPE HAVE SUNG OR HORACE BEEN INSPIRED BABA
TILL SOME MIGHT CHOOSE TO BUY HE HAD AN ENGLISH LOOK THAT IS WAS SQUARE IN MAKE OF A COMPLEXION WHITE AND RUDDY GOOD TEETH WITH CURLING RATHER DARK BROWN HAIR
SOCIETY ITSELF WHICH SHOULD CREATE KINDNESS DESTROYS WHAT LITTLE WE HAD GOT
PLAIN TRUTH DEAR MURRAY NEEDS FEW FLOWERS OF SPEECH TO MAKE MEN HAPPY OR TO KEEP THEM SO SO TAKE IT IN THE VERY WORDS OF CREECH
I NEITHER KNOW NOR CARE SAID BABA BUT PRAY DO AS I DESIRE I HAVE NO MORE TIME NOR MANY WORDS TO SPARE AT LEAST
THANK HEAVEN NOT MINE TO HEAR AND TO OBEY HAD BEEN FROM BIRTH THE LAW OF ALL AROUND HER TO FULFILL ALL PHANTASIES WHICH YIELDED JOY OR MIRTH HAD BEEN HER SLAVES CHIEF PLEASURE AS HER WILL
IF I MAY PRESUME WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE
T IS BAD AND MAY BE BETTER ALL MEN'S LOT MOST MEN ARE SLAVES NONE MORE SO THAN THE GREAT TO THEIR OWN WHIMS AND PASSIONS AND WHAT NOT
NO METHOD S MORE SURE AT MOMENTS TO TAKE HOLD OF THE BEST FEELINGS OF MANKIND
WE KNOW WHERE THINGS AND MEN MUST END AT BEST A MORAL LIKE ALL MORALS MELANCHOLY
OVERPOWERING KNELL THE TOCSIN OF THE SOUL THE DINNER BELL TURKEY CONTAINS NO BELLS AND YET MEN DINE
OR A PRETTY OPERA SCENE AND NEARER AS THEY CAME
WHICH PUZZLED NATURE MUCH TO KNOW WHAT ART MEANT IT SEEM'D HOWEVER BUT TO OPEN ON A RANGE OR SUITE OF FURTHER CHAMBERS WHICH MIGHT LEAD TO HEAVEN KNOWS WHERE BUT IN THIS ONE THE MOVABLES WERE PRODIGALLY RICH
PULL'D FORTH A QUANTITY OF CLOTHES FIT FOR THE BACK OF ANY MUSSULMAN WHATE'ER HIS WORTH AND OF VARIETY THERE WAS NO LACK AND YET THOUGH I HAVE SAID THERE WAS NO DEARTH
SOME TALK OF AN APPEAL UNTO SOME PASSION SOME TO MEN'S FEELINGS OTHERS TO THEIR REASON THE LAST OF THESE WAS NEVER MUCH THE FASHION FOR REASON THINKS ALL REASONING OUT OF SEASON
THE CYPRESS GROVES OLYMPUS HIGH AND HOAR
I OFFER YOU A HANDSOME SUIT OF CLOTHES
PROVIDED ALWAYS YOUR GREAT GOODNESS STILL REMITS THE MATTER TO OUR OWN FREE WILL
SIX TARTARS AND A DRAG CHAIN
BUT I DIGRESS OF ALL APPEALS ALTHOUGH I GRANT THE POWER OF PATHOS AND OF GOLD OF BEAUTY FLATTERY THREATS A SHILLING
A GAUDY TASTE FOR THEY ARE LITTLE SKILL'D IN THE ARTS OF WHICH THESE LANDS WERE ONCE THE FONT
LIKE A BACKGAMMON BOARD THE PLACE WAS DOTTED WITH WHITES AND BLACKS IN GROUPS ON SHOW FOR SALE THOUGH RATHER MORE IRREGULARLY SPOTTED SOME BOUGHT THE JET WHILE OTHERS CHOSE THE PALE
THOUGH THEY BELIEVE NOT YOU YET LET THEM THINK THAT HORACE HAS EXPREST SHORTLY AND SWEETLY THE MASONIC FOLLY OF THOSE FORGETTING THE GREAT PLACE OF REST WHO GIVE THEMSELVES TO ARCHITECTURE WHOLLY
THOUGH PIERCED THROUGH STOMACH HEART AND LIVER HE SEEM'D TO SLEEP FOR YOU COULD SCARCELY TELL AS HE BLED INWARDLY NO HIDEOUS RIVER OF GORE DIVULGED THE CAUSE THAT HE WAS DEAD SO AS I GAZED ON HIM
APPALS BUT SADDENS MORE BY NIGHT AS WELL AS DAY THAN AN ENORMOUS ROOM WITHOUT A SOUL TO BREAK THE LIFELESS SPLENDOUR OF THE WHOLE TWO OR THREE SEEM SO LITTLE
THIS IS A FACT AND NO POETIC FABLE JUST AS MY GREAT COAT WAS ABOUT ME CAST MY HAT AND GLOVES STILL LYING ON THE TABLE I HEARD A SHOT
STRIKE ME DEAD BUT THEY AS SOON SHALL CIRCUMCISE MY HEAD CUT OFF A THOUSAND HEADS BEFORE
BUT HUGE HOUSES FIT ILL AND HUGE TOMBS WORSE MANKIND SINCE ADAM FELL METHINKS THE STORY OF THE TOWER OF BABEL MIGHT TEACH THEM THIS MUCH BETTER THAN I M ABLE BABEL WAS NIMROD'S HUNTING BOX
HE DOUBTED NOT A FEW HOURS OF REFLECTION WOULD RECONCILE HIM TO THE BUSINESS QUITE WILL IT
UNLESS MAN WERE A PIG INDEED REPLETION RATHER ADDS TO WHAT HE FEELS
AND YOU WILL FIND US NOT TOP FOND OF JOKING
AS THEY WERE PLODDING ON THEIR WINDING WAY THROUGH ORANGE BOWERS AND JASMINE AND SO FORTH OF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE A GOOD DEAL TO SAY THERE BEING NO SUCH PROFUSION IN THE NORTH OF ORIENTAL PLANTS ET CETERA
EACH BEVY WITH THE MERCHANT IN HIS STATION POOR CREATURES
METHINKS SAID HE IT WOULD BE NO GREAT SHAME IF WE SHOULD STRIKE A STROKE TO SET US FREE LET S KNOCK THAT OLD BLACK FELLOW ON THE HEAD AND MARCH AWAY
WHAT DID SHE SHE DID NOT RUN AWAY TOO DID SHE SIR
WHOSE USE DEPENDS SO MUCH UPON THE GASTRIC JUICE THE OTHER EVENING
I GAZED UPON HIM FOR I KNEW HIM WELL AND THOUGH I HAVE SEEN MANY CORPSES NEVER SAW ONE WHOM SUCH AN ACCIDENT BEFELL SO CALM
MAKES US FEEL OUR MORTALITY IN FACT REDOUBLED
BUT THIS LAST BLOW AND HERE HE STOPP'D AGAIN AND TURN'D AWAY HIS FACE AY QUOTH HIS FRIEND
NOW I HAVE ANSWER'D ALL YOUR QUESTIONS WITHOUT PRESSING AND YOU AN EQUAL COURTESY SHOULD SHOW
AND GAZED AROUND THEM TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT WITH THE PROPHETIC EYE OF APPETITE
THEY LITTLE THINK WHAT MISCHIEF IS IN HAND THE GREATER THEIR SUCCESS THE WORSE IT PROVES AS OVID'S VERSE MAY GIVE TO UNDERSTAND EVEN PETRARCH'S SELF IF JUDGED WITH DUE SEVERITY IS THE PLATONIC PIMP OF ALL POSTERITY
I WISH THE CASE COULD COME BEFORE A JURY HERE BUT TO RESUME SHOULD THERE BE WHAT MAY NOT BE IN THESE DAYS SOME INFIDELS WHO DON'T BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND OUT THE VERY SPOT OF THAT SAME BABEL
THOUGH MY SOUL LOATHES THE EFFEMINATE GARB
AND THESE ARE THINGS WHICH ASK A TENDER TEAR SUCH AS I TOO WOULD SHED IF IN YOUR PLACE I CRIED UPON MY FIRST WIFE'S DYING DAY AND ALSO WHEN MY SECOND RAN AWAY
BUT TIME STRIPS OUR ILLUSIONS OF THEIR HUE AND ONE BY ONE IN TURN SOME GRAND MISTAKE CASTS OFF ITS BRIGHT SKIN YEARLY LIKE THE SNAKE
OLD BLACK EUNUCH SEEMS TO EYE US
AND HORRID WAS THE CONTRAST TO THE VIEW BUT LET ME QUIT THE THEME AS SUCH THINGS CLAIM PERHAPS EVEN MORE ATTENTION THAN IS DUE FROM ME
I GAZED AS OFT I HAVE GAZED THE SAME TO TRY IF I COULD WRENCH AUGHT OUT OF DEATH WHICH SHOULD CONFIRM OR SHAKE OR MAKE A FAITH BUT IT WAS ALL A MYSTERY
HE REPLIED I THOUGHT IN FACT YOU COULD NOT BE A GREEK THOSE SERVILE DOGS ARE NOT SO PROUDLY EYED FORTUNE HAS PLAY'D YOU HERE A PRETTY FREAK
YET I MUST OWN HE LOOKED A LITTLE DULL AND NOW AND THEN A TEAR STOLE DOWN BY STEALTH PERHAPS HIS RECENT LOSS OF BLOOD MIGHT PULL HIS SPIRIT DOWN AND THEN THE LOSS OF WEALTH A MISTRESS
PRAY WHAT IS YOUR NATION
JUST NOW A BLACK OLD NEUTRAL PERSONAGE OF THE THIRD SEX STEPT UP AND PEERING OVER THE CAPTIVES SEEM'D TO MARK THEIR LOOKS AND AGE AND CAPABILITIES
WE WHOSE MINDS COMPREHEND ALL THINGS NO MORE BUT LET US TO THE STORY AS BEFORE
THUS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THIS SEA CONTAINS NONE BUT SPECIES KNOWN TO US IN THEIR FOSSIL STATE IN WHICH FISHES AS WELL AS REPTILES ARE THE LESS PERFECTLY AND COMPLETELY ORGANISED THE FARTHER BACK THEIR DATE OF CREATION
AND STRIKE WITH THEIR HEADS THE GRANITE VAULT THAT BOUNDS THE SKY ALL THIS FOSSIL WORLD RISES TO LIFE AGAIN IN MY VIVID IMAGINATION I RETURN TO THE SCRIPTURAL PERIODS OR AGES OF THE WORLD
ABOUT THAT SEVENTY FIRST DEGREE WHERE SIR JAMES ROSS HAS DISCOVERED THE MAGNETIC POLE TO BE SITUATED WE SHOULD SEE THE NEEDLE POINT STRAIGHT UP THEREFORE THAT MYSTERIOUS CENTRE OF ATTRACTION IS AT NO GREAT DEPTH
A NEW MARE INTERNUM AT FIRST I COULD HARDLY SEE ANYTHING MY EYES UNACCUSTOMED TO THE LIGHT QUICKLY CLOSED WHEN I WAS ABLE TO REOPEN THEM
AT NOON HANS PREPARED A HOOK AT THE END OF A LINE HE BAITED IT WITH A SMALL PIECE OF MEAT AND FLUNG IT INTO THE SEA FOR TWO HOURS NOTHING WAS CAUGHT ARE THESE WATERS THEN BARE OF INHABITANTS
RETURNED TO THE SURFACE AND OSCILLATED TO AND FRO WITH THE WAVES ARE YOU CONVINCED SAID MY UNCLE I AM QUITE CONVINCED ALTHOUGH IT IS INCREDIBLE BY NEXT EVENING
BY VAST WALLS OF GRANITE WHICH SEEMED TO OVERPOWER ME WITH THEIR WEIGHT AND THAT ALL THIS SPACE GREAT AS IT WAS WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH FOR THE MARCH OF THE HUMBLEST OF SATELLITES
AND LYCOPODS A HUNDRED FEET HIGH AGES SEEM NO MORE THAN DAYS I AM PASSED AGAINST MY WILL IN RETROGRADE ORDER THROUGH THE LONG SERIES OF TERRESTRIAL CHANGES PLANTS DISAPPEAR
A STRANGE CREATURE WHICH SEEMED A COMPOUND OF HORSE RHINOCEROS CAMEL AND HIPPOPOTAMUS THE COLOSSAL MASTODON
AND AS THIS UNPLEASANT NOTION GOT HOLD OF ME I SURVEYED WITH ANXIOUS SCRUTINY THE OPEN SPACES BEFORE ME BUT NO LIVING CREATURE APPEARED UPON THE BARREN STRAND
AND THE GRAMPIANS ARE RAISING THEIR RUGGED SUMMITS ABOVE US YES ANSWERED THE PROFESSOR LAUGHING IT IS RATHER A HEAVY WEIGHT TO BEAR BUT A SOLID ARCH SPANS OVER OUR HEADS THE GREAT ARCHITECT HAS BUILT IT OF THE BEST MATERIALS
WE WILL TRY AXEL FOR WE MUST PENETRATE ALL SECRETS OF THESE NEWLY DISCOVERED REGIONS BUT WHERE ARE WE UNCLE FOR I HAVE NOT YET ASKED YOU THAT QUESTION AND YOUR INSTRUMENTS MUST BE ABLE TO FURNISH THE ANSWER
AND JUDGING BY THESE RIDGES OF FOAM YOU MAY OBSERVE THAT THE SEA WILL RISE ABOUT TWELVE FEET THIS IS WONDERFUL I SAID NO IT IS QUITE NATURAL YOU MAY SAY SO UNCLE BUT TO ME IT IS MOST EXTRAORDINARY
BONES OF EXTINCT ANIMALS I HAD RUSHED UPON THESE REMAINS FORMED OF INDESTRUCTIBLE PHOSPHATES OF LIME AND WITHOUT HESITATION I NAMED THESE MONSTROUS BONES WHICH LAY SCATTERED ABOUT LIKE DECAYED TRUNKS OF TREES
WITHIN ITS EXTREMITY A LITTLE HARBOUR WAS FORMED BETWEEN THE PYRAMIDAL CLIFFS WHERE THE STILL WATERS SLEPT UNTOUCHED BY THE BOISTEROUS WINDS A BRIG AND
THE WIND WAS FROM THE NORTH WEST WE WENT WITH IT AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED THE DENSE ATMOSPHERE ACTED WITH GREAT FORCE AND IMPELLED US SWIFTLY ON IN AN HOUR MY UNCLE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE OUR PROGRESS
MY UNCLE WHO WAS TENACIOUSLY FOND OF NAMING HIS NEW DISCOVERIES WANTED TO GIVE IT A NAME AND PROPOSED MINE AMONGST OTHERS BUT I HAVE A BETTER TO PROPOSE I SAID GRAUBEN LET IT BE CALLED
NOR WAS IT THE PALE AND UNCERTAIN SHIMMER OF THE MOONBEAMS THE DIM REFLECTION OF A NOBLER BODY OF LIGHT NO THE ILLUMINATING POWER OF THIS LIGHT ITS TREMBLING DIFFUSIVENESS ITS BRIGHT CLEAR WHITENESS AND ITS LOW TEMPERATURE
WELL REPLIED MY UNCLE IS THERE ANY SCIENTIFIC REASON AGAINST IT NO I
I WAS TO REGISTER EVERY OBSERVATION MAKE ENTRIES OF INTERESTING PHENOMENA THE DIRECTION OF THE WIND THE RATE OF SAILING THE WAY WE MADE IN A WORD EVERY PARTICULAR OF OUR SINGULAR VOYAGE
THERE WERE BROAD TRACTS OF VAPOUR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR BUT THEN THE WEATHER WAS FINE THE PLAY OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT PRODUCED SINGULAR EFFECTS UPON THE UPPER STRATA OF CLOUD
AND FOR HOURS MY PATIENCE WAS VYING WITH MY SURPRISE WHAT NATURAL FORCE COULD HAVE PRODUCED SUCH PLANTS AND WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN THE APPEARANCE OF THE EARTH IN THE FIRST AGES OF ITS FORMATION WHEN UNDER THE ACTION OF HEAT AND MOISTURE
AS WELL AS OF OTHERS BELONGING TO THE EXTINCT FAMILY OF THE DIPTERIDES BUT OF WHICH MY UNCLE COULD NOT TELL THE SPECIES NONE HAD ORGANS OF SIGHT THIS UNHOPED FOR CATCH RECRUITED OUR STOCK OF PROVISIONS
SO THEN THUS FAR HE ANSWERED THE THEORY OF SIR HUMPHRY DAVY IS CONFIRMED EVIDENTLY IT IS AND NOW THERE IS NO REASON WHY THERE SHOULD NOT BE SEAS AND CONTINENTS IN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH NO DOUBT
AND BUT FOR THE FROTHY TRACK OF THE RAFT I MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT WE WERE STANDING STILL ABOUT TWELVE IMMENSE SHOALS OF SEAWEEDS CAME IN SIGHT
ON THE LEFT HUGE PYRAMIDS OF ROCK PILED ONE UPON ANOTHER PRODUCED A PRODIGIOUS TITANIC EFFECT DOWN THEIR SIDES FLOWED NUMBERLESS WATERFALLS WHICH WENT ON THEIR WAY IN BRAWLING BUT PELLUCID STREAMS
FOR HIGH TIDE AND WE MUST NOT LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THIS PHENOMENON WHAT THE TIDE I CRIED CAN THE INFLUENCE OF THE SUN AND MOON BE FELT DOWN HERE WHY NOT
THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND FEET LONG UNDULATING LIKE VAST SERPENTS BEYOND THE REACH OF SIGHT I FOUND SOME AMUSEMENT IN TRACING THESE ENDLESS WAVES ALWAYS THINKING I SHOULD COME TO THE END OF THEM
DON'T YOU HEAR THE HAMMER AT WORK HANS IS ALREADY BUSY AT IT WHAT HAS HE ALREADY FELLED THE TREES OH THE TREES WERE ALREADY DOWN COME AND YOU WILL SEE FOR YOURSELF
WHICH BY THEIR CONDENSATION MUST AT CERTAIN TIMES FALL IN TORRENTS OF RAIN I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT UNDER SO POWERFUL A PRESSURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE THERE COULD BE NO EVAPORATION AND YET UNDER A LAW UNKNOWN TO ME
WE WILL CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY EVERYTHING HAVING GONE ON WELL SO FAR BUT HOW ARE WE TO GET DOWN BELOW THIS LIQUID SURFACE
SUPREMELY MELANCHOLY INSTEAD OF THE SHINING FIRMAMENT SPANGLED WITH ITS INNUMERABLE STARS SHINING SINGLY OR IN CLUSTERS I FELT THAT
I THEN DESIRED TO PIERCE THE DISTANT HAZE AND TO REND ASUNDER THE MYSTERIOUS CURTAIN THAT HUNG ACROSS THE HORIZON ANXIOUS QUERIES AROSE TO MY LIPS WHERE DID THAT SEA TERMINATE WHERE DID IT LEAD TO
OH I AM NOT AFRAID THAT IT WILL FALL DOWN UPON MY HEAD BUT NOW WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS ARE YOU NOT THINKING OF RETURNING TO THE SURFACE NOW RETURN
SHARPLY DEFINED AGAINST THE HAZY DISTANT HORIZON IT WAS QUITE AN OCEAN WITH THE IRREGULAR SHORES OF EARTH BUT DESERT AND FRIGHTFULLY WILD IN APPEARANCE
I FELT RATHER TIRED AND WENT TO SIT DOWN AT THE END OF A PROMONTORY AT THE FOOT OF WHICH THE WAVES CAME AND BEAT THEMSELVES INTO SPRAY THENCE MY EYE COULD SWEEP EVERY PART OF THE BAY
WHAT IS THE MATTER MY UNCLE BREAKS IN MY STARING EYES ARE FIXED VACANTLY UPON HIM TAKE CARE AXEL OR YOU WILL FALL OVERBOARD AT THAT MOMENT I FELT THE SINEWY HAND OF HANS
A VARIETY OF BROWN COAL OR LIGNITE FOUND CHIEFLY IN ICELAND BUT SURELY THEN LIKE OTHER FOSSIL WOOD IT MUST BE AS HARD AS STONE AND CANNOT FLOAT
BUT IF ALL OCEANS ARE PROPERLY SPEAKING BUT LAKES
HE ASKED YES CERTAINLY AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE DELIGHTFUL WELL TAKE MY ARM AXEL AND LET US FOLLOW THE WINDINGS OF THE SHORE I EAGERLY ACCEPTED AND WE BEGAN TO COAST ALONG THIS NEW SEA
THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM ALONE WAS DEVELOPING ON ITS SURFACE EVENING CAME AND AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY I PERCEIVED NO CHANGE IN THE LUMINOUS CONDITION OF THE AIR IT WAS A CONSTANT CONDITION
A HALF FINISHED RAFT WAS ALREADY LYING ON THE SAND MADE OF A PECULIAR KIND OF WOOD AND A GREAT NUMBER OF PLANKS STRAIGHT AND BENT AND OF FRAMES WERE COVERING THE GROUND ENOUGH ALMOST FOR A LITTLE FLEET
ITS STRANGE AND WONDERFUL DETAILS I HAVE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING THAT SURROUNDS ME THE PROFESSOR THE GUIDE THE RAFT ARE ALL GONE OUT OF MY KEN AN ILLUSION HAS LAID HOLD UPON ME
AND SOMETIMES FORM BARRIERS STRONG ENOUGH TO IMPEDE THE COURSE OF A SHIP BUT NEVER I THINK WERE SUCH SEAWEEDS AS THOSE WHICH WE SAW FLOATING IN IMMENSE WAVING LINES
THE IMMENSE MAMMOTH CAVE IN KENTUCKY IS OF GIGANTIC PROPORTIONS
BUT THIS ONE DISPLAYS A PECULIARITY CONFINED TO ALL FISHES THAT INHABIT SUBTERRANEAN WATERS IT IS BLIND AND NOT ONLY BLIND BUT ACTUALLY HAS NO EYES AT ALL I LOOKED NOTHING COULD BE MORE CERTAIN
WELL AXEL THERE IS A VERY SIMPLE ANSWER TO YOUR OBJECTION THAT THIS SOIL IS ALLUVIAL WHAT
FOUND IN THE CAVERNS OF BRAZIL THE MERYCOTHERIUM
ARE NOT ALL BODIES SUBJECT THROUGHOUT THEIR MASS TO THE POWER OF UNIVERSAL ATTRACTION THIS MASS OF WATER CANNOT ESCAPE THE GENERAL LAW AND IN SPITE OF THE HEAVY ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE ON THE SURFACE YOU WILL SEE IT RISE LIKE THE ATLANTIC ITSELF
A GIGANTIC TAPIR HIDES BEHIND THE ROCKS TO DISPUTE ITS PREY WITH THE ANOPLOTHERIUM
MY SURPRISE TURNED INTO ADMIRATION THERE STOOD BEFORE ME PRODUCTIONS OF EARTH BUT OF GIGANTIC STATURE WHICH MY UNCLE IMMEDIATELY NAMED
SO THAT WE HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE AND WE SHALL SET SAIL TO MORROW I LOOKED ABOUT FOR A SHIP SET SAIL SHALL WE BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MY BOAT FIRST IT WILL NOT BE A BOAT AT ALL
WHICH BY IMPERCEPTIBLE DEGREES DISSOLVES INTO A GASEOUS MASS GLOWING FIERY RED AND WHITE AS LARGE AND AS SHINING AS THE SUN
THOUGH A CHILL FELL UPON ME AS SOON AS I CAME UNDER THOSE CELLULAR VAULTS FOR HALF AN HOUR WE WANDERED FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN THE DAMP SHADES AND IT WAS A COMFORTABLE AND PLEASANT CHANGE TO ARRIVE ONCE MORE UPON THE SEA SHORE
IN COLOMBIA VISITED BY HUMBOLDT HAD NOT GIVEN UP THE WHOLE OF THE SECRET OF ITS DEPTH TO THE PHILOSOPHER WHO INVESTIGATED IT TO THE DEPTH OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET IT PROBABLY DID NOT EXTEND MUCH FARTHER
PORT GRAEUBEN IT WILL LOOK VERY WELL UPON THE MAP PORT GRAEUBEN LET IT BE THEN AND SO THE CHERISHED REMEMBRANCE OF MY VIRLANDAISE BECAME ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ADVENTUROUS EXPEDITION
AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S WALKING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PROMONTORY WHICH FORMED THE LITTLE NATURAL HARBOUR I PERCEIVED HANS AT WORK IN A FEW MORE STEPS I WAS AT HIS SIDE TO MY GREAT SURPRISE
WHAT MATTERS REPLIED THE PHILOSOPHER WHETHER THIS OR ANOTHER SERVES TO GUIDE US I THOUGHT HIM RATHER UNGRATEFUL BUT AT THAT MOMENT MY ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO AN UNEXPECTED SIGHT
THE TRANSITION PERIOD THESE HUMBLE GARDEN PLANTS WITH US WERE TALL TREES IN THE EARLY AGES LOOK AXEL AND ADMIRE IT ALL NEVER HAD BOTANIST SUCH A FEAST AS THIS YOU ARE RIGHT MY UNCLE
AND HIS OPINION DIFFERS FROM MINE THE HEAD OF THIS FISH WAS FLAT BUT ROUNDED IN FRONT AND THE ANTERIOR PART OF ITS BODY WAS PLATED WITH BONY ANGULAR SCALES IT HAD NO TEETH
WHAT DEPTH HAVE WE NOW REACHED WE ARE THIRTY FIVE LEAGUES BELOW THE SURFACE SO I SAID EXAMINING THE MAP THE HIGHLANDS OF SCOTLAND ARE OVER OUR HEADS
AT ANY RATE HE REPLIED WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY YET
SOME OF THESE DIVIDING THE BEACH WITH THEIR SHARP SPURS FORMED CAPES AND PROMONTORIES WORN AWAY BY THE CEASELESS ACTION OF THE SURF FARTHER ON THE EYE DISCERNED THEIR MASSIVE OUTLINE
CLIMATES ARE NO MORE THE HEAT OF THE GLOBE CONTINUALLY INCREASES AND NEUTRALISES THAT OF THE SUN VEGETATION BECOMES ACCELERATED I GLIDE LIKE A SHADE AMONGST ARBORESCENT FERNS
SHUT UP INSIDE AN IMMEASURABLE EXCAVATION ITS WIDTH COULD NOT BE ESTIMATED SINCE THE SHORE RAN WIDENING AS FAR AS EYE COULD REACH NOR COULD ITS LENGTH FOR THE DIM HORIZON BOUNDED THE NEW AS FOR ITS HEIGHT IT
THE PERMANENCY OF WHICH MIGHT BE RELIED UPON AFTER SUPPER I LAID MYSELF DOWN AT THE FOOT OF THE MAST AND FELL ASLEEP IN THE MIDST OF FANTASTIC REVERIES HANS KEEPING FAST BY THE HELM
FLAP THEIR SAIL BROAD VANS IN THIS DENSE AND HEAVY ATMOSPHERE THERE ARE SUFFICIENT FISH FOR THEIR SUPPORT I SURVEY THE WHOLE SPACE THAT STRETCHES OVERHEAD IT IS AS DESERT AS THE SHORE WAS
AND NEVER COULD MAN HAVE GIVEN IT SO WIDE A STRETCH WHAT ARE THE FINEST ARCHES OF BRIDGES AND THE ARCADES OF CATHEDRALS COMPARED WITH THIS FAR REACHING VAULT WITH A RADIUS OF THREE LEAGUES
DO YOU FEEL ILL MY UNCLE ASKED NO BUT I HAVE HAD A STRANGE HALLUCINATION IT IS OVER NOW IS ALL GOING ON RIGHT
SHOWED THAT IT MUST BE OF ELECTRIC ORIGIN IT WAS LIKE AN AURORA BOREALIS A CONTINUOUS COSMICAL PHENOMENON FILLING A CAVERN OF SUFFICIENT EXTENT TO CONTAIN AN OCEAN
A MAST WAS MADE OF TWO POLES SPLICED TOGETHER A YARD WAS MADE OF A THIRD A BLANKET BORROWED FROM OUR COVERINGS MADE A TOLERABLE SAIL THERE WAS NO WANT OF CORDAGE FOR THE RIGGING AND EVERYTHING WAS WELL AND FIRMLY MADE
IT IS ONLY A FOREST OF MUSHROOMS SAID HE AND HE WAS RIGHT IMAGINE THE LARGE DEVELOPMENT ATTAINED BY THESE PLANTS WHICH PREFER A WARM MOIST CLIMATE
LET THE RAFT RUN ON WHICH AFTER ALL NEEDED NO STEERING THE WIND BLOWING DIRECTLY AFT SINCE OUR DEPARTURE FROM PORT GRAEUBEN PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK HAD ENTRUSTED THE LOG TO MY CARE
AT A DISTANCE OF FIVE HUNDRED PACES AT THE TURN OF A HIGH PROMONTORY APPEARED A HIGH TUFTED DENSE FOREST IT WAS COMPOSED OF TREES OF MODERATE HEIGHT FORMED LIKE UMBRELLAS WITH EXACT GEOMETRICAL OUTLINES
ON THIS SLIGHTLY INCLINING SHORE ABOUT A HUNDRED FATHOMS FROM THE LIMIT OF THE WAVES CAME DOWN THE FOOT OF A HUGE WALL OF VAST CLIFFS WHICH ROSE MAJESTICALLY TO AN ENORMOUS HEIGHT
SAID MY UNCLE AND INHABITED TOO TO BE SURE SAID I AND WHY SHOULD NOT THESE WATERS YIELD TO US
THE DEEPLY INDENTED SHORE WAS LINED WITH A BREADTH OF FINE SHINING SAND SOFTLY LAPPED BY THE WAVES AND STREWN WITH THE SMALL SHELLS WHICH HAD BEEN INHABITED BY THE FIRST OF CREATED BEINGS
GRANITE ROCKS SOFTEN INTENSE HEAT CONVERTS SOLID BODIES INTO THICK FLUIDS THE WATERS AGAIN COVER THE FACE OF THE EARTH THEY BOIL THEY RISE IN WHIRLING EDDIES OF STEAM
HANS HAD FITTED UP A RUDDER TO STEER HIS VESSEL HE TOOK THE TILLER AND UNMOORED THE SAIL WAS SET AND WE WERE SOON AFLOAT AT THE MOMENT OF LEAVING THE HARBOUR
I WAS AWARE OF THE GREAT POWERS OF VEGETATION THAT CHARACTERISE THESE PLANTS WHICH GROW AT A DEPTH OF TWELVE THOUSAND FEET REPRODUCE THEMSELVES UNDER A PRESSURE OF FOUR HUNDRED ATMOSPHERES
HORIZONTALLY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY LEAGUES FROM ICELAND SO MUCH AS THAT I AM SURE OF NOT BEING A MILE OUT OF MY RECKONING
PREPARATIONS FOR A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY THE NEXT MORNING I AWOKE FEELING PERFECTLY WELL I THOUGHT A BATHE WOULD DO ME GOOD AND I WENT TO PLUNGE FOR A FEW MINUTES INTO THE WATERS OF THIS MEDITERRANEAN SEA
I ALMOST FANCIED I SHOULD PRESENTLY SEE SOME SHIP ISSUE FROM IT FULL SAIL AND TAKE TO THE OPEN SEA UNDER THE SOUTHERN BREEZE BUT THIS ILLUSION LASTED A VERY SHORT TIME
COAST THIRTY LEAGUES TO LEEWARD NOTHING IN SIGHT BEFORE US INTENSITY OF LIGHT THE SAME WEATHER FINE THAT IS TO SAY THAT THE CLOUDS ARE FLYING HIGH ARE LIGHT
ITS PECTORAL FINS WERE LARGE AND OF TAIL THERE WAS NONE THE ANIMAL BELONGED TO THE SAME ORDER AS THE STURGEON BUT DIFFERED FROM THAT FISH IN MANY ESSENTIAL PARTICULARS
IS CLIMBING UP THE STEEP ASCENTS HIGHER YET THE PTERODACTYLE
MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL LEAGUES WHERE THIS VAULT RESTED UPON ITS GRANITE BASE NO EYE COULD TELL BUT THERE WAS A CLOUD HANGING FAR ABOVE THE HEIGHT OF WHICH WE ESTIMATED AT TWELVE THOUSAND FEET
A GREATER HEIGHT THAN THAT OF ANY TERRESTRIAL VAPOUR AND NO DOUBT DUE TO THE GREAT DENSITY OF THE AIR THE WORD CAVERN DOES NOT CONVEY ANY IDEA OF THIS IMMENSE SPACE
IS A HAPPY EVENT FOR A NATURALIST BUT TO WHAT FAMILY DOES IT BELONG IT IS OF THE ORDER OF GANOIDS OF THE FAMILY OF THE CEPHALASPIDAE AND A SPECIES OF PTERICHTHYS
IF MY EYES WERE ABLE TO RANGE AFAR OVER THIS GREAT SEA IT WAS BECAUSE A PECULIAR LIGHT BROUGHT TO VIEW EVERY DETAIL OF IT IT WAS NOT THE LIGHT OF THE SUN
AND I DON'T SUPPOSE ANY OTHER DISCOVERER WILL EVER DISPUTE MY CLAIM TO NAME IT AFTER MYSELF AS ITS FIRST DISCOVERER A VAST SHEET OF WATER
WOULD YOU THEN CONCLUDE I SAID THAT THE MAGNETIC POLE IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE AND THE POINT WHERE WE ARE EXACTLY SO AND IT IS LIKELY ENOUGH THAT IF WE WERE TO REACH THE SPOT BENEATH THE POLAR REGIONS
THEN THE ZOOPHYTES OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD ALSO RETURN TO NOTHING I AM THE ONLY LIVING THING IN THE WORLD ALL LIFE IS CONCENTRATED IN MY BEATING HEART ALONE THERE ARE NO MORE SEASONS
THE PROVISIONS THE BAGGAGE THE INSTRUMENTS THE GUNS AND A GOOD QUANTITY OF FRESH WATER FROM THE ROCKS AROUND ALL FOUND THEIR PROPER PLACES ON BOARD AND AT SIX THE PROFESSOR GAVE THE SIGNAL TO EMBARK
BUT SUPPOSING IT MIGHT BE A SOLITARY CASE WE BAITED AFRESH AND THREW OUT OUR LINE SURELY THIS OCEAN IS WELL PEOPLED WITH FISH FOR IN ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS
NO THERE'S A PULL AT THE LINE HANS DRAWS IT IN AND BRINGS OUT A STRUGGLING FISH A STURGEON I CRIED A SMALL STURGEON THE PROFESSOR EYES THE CREATURE ATTENTIVELY
THE VAULT THAT SPANNED THE SPACE ABOVE THE SKY IF IT COULD BE CALLED SO SEEMED COMPOSED OF VAST PLAINS OF CLOUD SHIFTING AND VARIABLE VAPOURS
TWO STARS PLUTO AND PROSERPINE ROLLED WITHIN UPON THE CIRCUIT OF THEIR MYSTERIOUS ORBITS
OF AN UNFATHOMABLE LAKE AND TRAVELLERS HAVE EXPLORED ITS RAMIFICATIONS TO THE EXTENT OF FORTY MILES BUT WHAT WERE THESE CAVITIES COMPARED TO THAT IN WHICH I STOOD WITH WONDER AND ADMIRATION WITH ITS SKY OF LUMINOUS VAPOURS ITS BURSTS OF ELECTRIC LIGHT
DEEP SHADOWS REPOSED UPON THEIR LOWER WREATHS AND OFTEN BETWEEN TWO SEPARATED FIELDS OF CLOUD THERE GLIDED DOWN A RAY OF UNSPEAKABLE LUSTRE BUT IT WAS NOT SOLAR LIGHT AND THERE WAS NO HEAT
TREADING WITH UNSTEADY FEET THE COLOURED MARLS AND THE PARTICOLOURED CLAYS I LEAN FOR SUPPORT AGAINST THE TRUNKS OF IMMENSE CONIFERS I LIE IN THE SHADE OF SPHENOPHYLLA
AT THIS RATE HE SAID WE SHALL MAKE THIRTY LEAGUES IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND WE SHALL SOON COME IN SIGHT OF THE OPPOSITE SHORE I MADE NO ANSWER BUT WENT AND SAT FORWARD THE NORTHERN SHORE WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO DIP UNDER THE HORIZON
AND A VAST SEA FILLING ITS BED MY IMAGINATION FELL POWERLESS BEFORE SUCH IMMENSITY I GAZED UPON THESE WONDERS IN SILENCE WORDS FAILED ME TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS
ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF ATTRACTION AND GRAVITATION PROBABLY THERE WERE SUBSIDENCES OF THE OUTER CRUST WHEN A PORTION OF THE SEDIMENTARY DEPOSITS WAS CARRIED DOWN SUDDEN OPENINGS THAT MAY BE I REPLIED
PERHAPS WE MAY YET MEET WITH SOME OF THOSE SAURIANS WHICH SCIENCE HAS RECONSTRUCTED OUT OF A BIT OF BONE OR CARTILAGE I TOOK UP THE TELESCOPE AND SCANNED THE WHOLE HORIZON AND FOUND IT EVERYWHERE A DESERT SEA
BUT THE SUBTERRANEAN VEGETATION WAS NOT CONFINED TO THESE FUNGI FARTHER ON ROSE GROUPS OF TALL TREES OF COLOURLESS FOLIAGE AND EASY TO RECOGNISE THEY WERE LOWLY SHRUBS OF EARTH
AFTER A SHORT EXAMINATION MY UNCLE PRONOUNCED HIS OPINION THIS FISH BELONGS TO AN EXTINCT FAMILY OF WHICH ONLY FOSSIL TRACES ARE FOUND IN THE DEVONIAN FORMATIONS WHAT I CRIED
THEN I REMEMBERED THE THEORY OF AN ENGLISH CAPTAIN WHO LIKENED THE EARTH TO A VAST HOLLOW SPHERE IN THE INTERIOR OF WHICH THE AIR BECAME LUMINOUS BECAUSE OF THE VAST PRESSURE THAT WEIGHED UPON IT WHILE
THE GLISTENING BLUISH RAYS OF ELECTRIC LIGHT HERE AND THERE REFLECTED BY THE DANCING DROPS OF SPRAY SHOT OUT LITTLE SHEAVES OF LIGHT FROM THE TRACK WE LEFT IN OUR REAR SOON WE ENTIRELY LOST SIGHT OF LAND
VAST GLOBULAR VOLUMES OF VAPOROUS MISTS WHICH ROLL UPON THEIR FLAMING ORBITS THROUGH INFINITE SPACE BUT IS IT NOT A DREAM WHITHER IS IT CARRYING ME MY FEVERISH HAND HAS VAINLY ATTEMPTED TO DESCRIBE UPON PAPER
A FEW LIGHT VAPOURS LEAPING FROM ROCK TO ROCK DENOTED THE PLACE OF HOT SPRINGS AND STREAMS FLOWED SOFTLY DOWN TO THE COMMON BASIN GLIDING DOWN THE GENTLE SLOPES WITH A SOFTER MURMUR
DARTS IN IRREGULAR ZIGZAGS TO AND FRO IN THE HEAVY AIR IN THE UPPERMOST REGIONS OF THE AIR IMMENSE BIRDS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE CASSOWARY AND LARGER THAN THE OSTRICH SPREAD THEIR VAST BREADTH OF WINGS
THE EASTERN AND WESTERN STRANDS SPREAD WIDE AS IF TO BID US FAREWELL BEFORE OUR EYES LAY FAR AND WIDE A VAST SEA SHADOWS OF GREAT CLOUDS SWEPT HEAVILY OVER ITS SILVER GREY SURFACE
I COULD NOT GIVE ANY NAME TO THESE SINGULAR CREATIONS WERE THEY SOME OF THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SPECIES OF VEGETABLES KNOWN HITHERTO AND DID THEY CLAIM A PLACE OF THEIR OWN IN THE LACUSTRINE FLORA NO WHEN WE ARRIVED UNDER THEIR SHADE
FOR ASSUREDLY IT BETTER DESERVED THIS NAME THAN ANY OTHER SEA I CAME BACK TO BREAKFAST WITH A GOOD APPETITE HANS WAS A GOOD CATERER FOR OUR LITTLE HOUSEHOLD HE HAD WATER AND FIRE AT HIS DISPOSAL
YOU'RE ALWAYS MAKING A MESS OF IT
THE HINT OF AN INVINCIBLE MULTITUDE BEHIND THAT MAN'S BACK ROUSED A SOMBRE INDIGNATION IN THE BREAST OF THE PROFESSOR HE SMILED NO LONGER HIS ENIGMATIC AND MOCKING SMILE
AND PARTICLES OF SPLINTERED WOOD AS FINE AS NEEDLES HAD TO IN ONE PLACE SAID THE STOLID CONSTABLE I SENT A KEEPER TO FETCH A SPADE
HE WALKED WITH THE NERVELESS GAIT OF A TRAMP GOING ON STILL GOING ON INDIFFERENT TO RAIN OR SUN IN A SINISTER DETACHMENT FROM THE ASPECTS OF SKY AND EARTH CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT ON THE OTHER HAND AFTER WATCHING HIM FOR A WHILE
BUT NOT QUITE FREE OF THAT JEALOUS MISTRUST WHICH SO OFTEN SPRINGS ON THE GROUND OF PERFECT DEVOTION WHETHER TO WOMEN OR TO INSTITUTIONS IT WAS IN THIS MENTAL DISPOSITION PHYSICALLY VERY EMPTY
AN UNHAPPY HOMELESS COUCH ACCOMPANIED BY TWO UNRELATED CHAIRS STOOD IN THE OPEN THE ONLY HUMAN BEING MAKING USE OF THE ALLEY BESIDES THE PROFESSOR COMING STALWART AND ERECT FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
IN A CERTAIN APARTMENT OF THE HOSPITAL ANOTHER WATERPROOF SHEET WAS SPREAD OVER THAT TABLE IN THE MANNER OF A TABLE CLOTH WITH THE CORNERS TURNED UP OVER A SORT OF MOUND A HEAP OF RAGS SCORCHED AND BLOODSTAINED
THIEVING WAS NOT A SHEER ABSURDITY
HE PROCURED FOR HIMSELF THE APPEARANCES OF POWER AND PERSONAL PRESTIGE THAT WAS UNDENIABLE TO HIS VENGEFUL BITTERNESS IT PACIFIED ITS UNREST
EXPOSING HIMSELF THEREBY TO THE UNANSWERABLE RETORT OF A FINGER TIP LAID FORCIBLY ON THE TELEGRAM WHICH THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER AFTER READING IT ALOUD HAD FLUNG ON THE DESK TO BE CRUSHED AS IT WERE UNDER THE TIP OF A FOREFINGER
STOOD HIS GROUND BUT FOR A WHOLE MINUTE HE DID NOT ADVANCE A LOCAL CONSTABLE IN UNIFORM CAST A SIDELONG GLANCE AND SAID
THOSE WERE PERFECTLY PROPER WORDS WITHIN THE TRADITION AND SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER OF A POLICE OFFICER ADDRESSING ONE OF HIS SPECIAL FLOCK BUT THE RECEPTION THEY GOT DEPARTED FROM TRADITION AND PROPRIETY IT WAS OUTRAGEOUS
ASKED CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WITH SCORNFUL HASTE LIKE A MAN IN A HURRY WHO PERCEIVES HE IS WASTING HIS TIME THE PERFECT ANARCHIST ANSWERED BY A SMILE WHICH DID NOT PART HIS THIN COLOURLESS LIPS
THE RESISTING POWER OF NUMBERS THE UNATTACKABLE STOLIDITY OF A GREAT MULTITUDE WAS THE HAUNTING FEAR OF HIS SINISTER LONELINESS HIS LIPS TREMBLED FOR SOME TIME BEFORE HE MANAGED TO SAY IN A STRANGLED VOICE
AS THE DOCTORS ARE TO EXAMINE CLOSELY THE MANGLED REMAINS OF HUMAN BEINGS
IT WAS VAIN TO PRETEND TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED BUT THAT WAS MERE FEELING THE STOICISM OF HIS THOUGHT COULD NOT BE DISTURBED BY THIS OR ANY OTHER FAILURE NEXT TIME
THE PROFESSOR DID NOT STIR AN INCH THE BLENDED NOISES OF THE ENORMOUS TOWN SANK DOWN TO AN INARTICULATE LOW MURMUR CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT OF THE SPECIAL CRIMES DEPARTMENT CHANGED HIS TONE
INSTANTANEOUS HE REMEMBERED ALL HE HAD EVER READ IN POPULAR PUBLICATIONS OF LONG AND TERRIFYING DREAMS DREAMED IN THE INSTANT OF WAKING
THE COLOUR OF RIPE CORN FRAMED WITH THEIR POINTS THE SQUARE BLOCK OF HIS SHAVED CHIN
HIS RIGHT HAND FELL LIGHTLY ON THE BACK OF THE OUTCAST COUCH THE LEFT REMAINED PURPOSEFULLY PLUNGED DEEP IN THE TROUSERS POCKET AND THE ROUNDNESS OF THE HEAVY RIMMED SPECTACLES IMPARTED AN OWLISH CHARACTER TO HIS MOODY UNPERTURBED FACE
THE CONSTABLE PAUSED THE LEAST FLICKER OF AN INNOCENT SELF LAUDATORY SMILE INVESTED HIS ROUND FACE WITH AN INFANTILE EXPRESSION STUMBLED HE ANNOUNCED POSITIVELY I STUMBLED ONCE MYSELF
HAD SET BEFORE HIM A GOAL OF POWER AND PRESTIGE TO BE ATTAINED WITHOUT THE MEDIUM OF ARTS GRACES TACT WEALTH BY SHEER WEIGHT OF MERIT ALONE ON THAT VIEW HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF ENTITLED TO UNDISPUTED SUCCESS HIS FATHER
A FAIR HAIRED FELLOW THE LAST OBSERVED IN A PLACID TONE AND PAUSED THE OLD WOMAN WHO SPOKE TO THE SERGEANT NOTICED A FAIR HAIRED FELLOW COMING OUT OF MAZE HILL STATION HE PAUSED
OR ELSE THE HEROES WOULD HAVE TO BRUSH THEIR OWN CLOTHES LIKEWISE NO DEPARTMENT APPEARS PERFECTLY WISE TO THE INTIMACY OF ITS WORKERS A DEPARTMENT DOES NOT KNOW SO MUCH AS SOME OF ITS SERVANTS BEING A DISPASSIONATE ORGANISM
AT THAT TIME HE WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE KING WILLIAM STREET LODGE TALKING TO THE KEEPER THE CONCUSSION MADE HIM TINGLE ALL OVER HE RAN BETWEEN THE TREES TOWARDS THE OBSERVATORY AS FAST AS MY LEGS WOULD CARRY ME HE REPEATED TWICE
TRUTH TO SAY CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT THOUGHT BUT LITTLE OF ANARCHISM HE DID NOT ATTACH UNDUE IMPORTANCE TO IT AND COULD NEVER BRING HIMSELF TO CONSIDER IT SERIOUSLY IT HAD MORE THE CHARACTER OF DISORDERLY CONDUCT
AND HE WAS A FAIR HAIRED FELLOW SHE NOTICED TWO MEN COMING OUT OF THE STATION AFTER THE UPTRAIN HAD GONE ON HE CONTINUED SLOWLY SHE COULDN'T TELL IF THEY WERE TOGETHER
OR THE TIME AFTER NEXT A TELLING STROKE WOULD BE DELIVERED SOMETHING REALLY STARTLING
OR PERHAPS OF APPEASED CONSCIENCE LOST IN THE CROWD MISERABLE AND UNDERSIZED HE MEDITATED CONFIDENTLY ON HIS POWER KEEPING HIS HAND IN THE LEFT POCKET OF HIS TROUSERS
IT WAS IN REALITY A CHANCE MEETING CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT HAD HAD A DISAGREEABLY BUSY DAY SINCE HIS DEPARTMENT RECEIVED THE FIRST TELEGRAM FROM GREENWICH A LITTLE BEFORE ELEVEN IN THE MORNING FIRST OF ALL
AS IF THE MOCKING SPIRIT WITHIN HAD LOST ITS ASSURANCE CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WENT ON DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME EH WELL YOU'VE ONLY GOT TO LOOK ABOUT YOU WE ARE AND ANYWAY YOU'RE NOT DOING IT WELL
WOULD HAVE SERVED HIS REPUTATION BETTER ON THE OTHER HAND HE ADMITTED TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PRESERVE ONE'S REPUTATION IF RANK OUTSIDERS WERE GOING TO TAKE A HAND IN THE BUSINESS OUTSIDERS ARE THE BANE OF THE POLICE AS OF OTHER PROFESSIONS
FUNNY THE OLD WOMAN SHOULD HAVE NOTICED THE VELVET COLLAR DARK BLUE OVERCOAT WITH A VELVET COLLAR SHE HAS TOLD US HE WAS THE CHAP SHE SAW AND NO MISTAKE AND HERE HE IS ALL COMPLETE VELVET COLLAR AND ALL
ALL THE TIME HIS TRAINED FACULTIES OF AN EXCELLENT INVESTIGATOR WHO SCORNS NO CHANCE OF INFORMATION FOLLOWED THE SELF SATISFIED DISJOINTED LOQUACITY OF THE CONSTABLE
BUT NOT SO KINDLY AS IF HE WERE CONDESCENDING TO GIVE GOOD ADVICE TO A CRACKSMAN OF REPUTE GIVE IT UP YOU'LL FIND WE ARE TOO MANY FOR YOU THE FIXED SMILE ON THE PROFESSOR'S LIPS WAVERED
THE MURMUR OF TOWN LIFE THE SUBDUED RUMBLE OF WHEELS IN THE TWO INVISIBLE STREETS TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT CAME THROUGH THE CURVE OF THE SORDID LANE TO HIS EARS WITH A PRECIOUS FAMILIARITY AND AN APPEALING SWEETNESS
ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU AT ONCE NONE OF OUR LOT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS HE WAS STRONG IN HIS INTEGRITY OF A GOOD DETECTIVE BUT HE SAW NOW THAT AN IMPENETRABLY ATTENTIVE RESERVE TOWARDS THIS INCIDENT
THE CONSTABLE UTTERED WEIGHTILY AND PAUSED WITH ANOTHER OBLIQUE GLANCE AT THE TABLE THEN SUDDENLY
THE TONE OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER'S REMARKS HAD BEEN SOUR ENOUGH TO SET ONE'S TEETH ON EDGE AND SINCE BREAKFAST CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT HAD NOT MANAGED TO GET ANYTHING TO EAT STARTING IMMEDIATELY TO BEGIN HIS INVESTIGATION ON THE SPOT
AFFECTED HIS FEELINGS WITH A SENSE OF RUTHLESS CRUELTY THOUGH HIS REASON TOLD HIM THE EFFECT MUST HAVE BEEN AS SWIFT AS A FLASH OF LIGHTNING THE MAN WHOEVER HE WAS HAD DIED INSTANTANEOUSLY
TILL HE EVOLVED A HORRIBLE NOTION THAT AGES OF ATROCIOUS PAIN AND MENTAL TORTURE COULD BE CONTAINED BETWEEN TWO SUCCESSIVE WINKS OF AN EYE AND MEANTIME THE CHIEF INSPECTOR WENT ON PEERING AT THE TABLE WITH A CALM FACE
HIS FACE AVERTED FROM THE ROOM EXPRESSED A STARTLED INTENSE INTEREST WHILE HE EXAMINED CLOSELY THE TRIANGULAR PIECE OF BROAD CLOTH BY A SUDDEN JERK HE DETACHED IT
I SHOULD THINK YOU CAN IMAGINE EASILY THE SORT OF STUFF THAT WOULD BE PRINTED BUT YOU MAY BE EXPOSED TO THE UNPLEASANTNESS OF BEING BURIED TOGETHER WITH ME
PUSHING ON BLIND AND ORDERLY AND ABSORBED IMPERVIOUS TO SENTIMENT TO LOGIC TO TERROR TOO PERHAPS THAT WAS THE FORM OF DOUBT HE FEARED MOST IMPERVIOUS TO FEAR OFTEN WHILE WALKING ABROAD
ON ONE SIDE THE LOW BRICK HOUSES HAD IN THEIR DUSTY WINDOWS THE SIGHTLESS MORIBUND LOOK OF INCURABLE DECAY EMPTY SHELLS AWAITING DEMOLITION FROM THE OTHER SIDE LIFE HAD NOT DEPARTED WHOLLY AS YET
NOT IN A HURRY TO GET HOME HE ASKED WITH MOCKING SIMPLICITY THE UNWHOLESOME LOOKING LITTLE MORAL AGENT OF DESTRUCTION EXULTED SILENTLY IN THE POSSESSION OF PERSONAL PRESTIGE
AND PITCHED ON MY HEAD TOO WHILE RUNNING UP THEM ROOTS DO STICK OUT ALL ABOUT THE PLACE STUMBLED AGAINST THE ROOT OF A TREE AND FELL AND THAT THING HE WAS CARRYING MUST HAVE GONE OFF RIGHT UNDER HIS CHEST I EXPECT
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW YOURSELVES YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYTHING BY IT MEANTIME IT'S YOU WHO GET SOMETHING FROM IT SO FAR AND YOU GET IT EASILY TOO I WON'T SPEAK OF YOUR SALARY
SHOOK HIM ALL OVER WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST SOUND CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS LED TO ADD AGAINST HIS BETTER JUDGMENT NOT YET WHEN I WANT YOU I WILL KNOW WHERE TO FIND YOU
BUT NEITHER WERE THE THIEVES HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AFTER THEY SUBMITTED TO THE SEVERE SANCTIONS OF A MORALITY FAMILIAR TO CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WITH A CERTAIN RESIGNATION
WHILE STILL LAUGHING HE MOVED ON BUT HE DID NOT LAUGH LONG IT WAS A SAD FACED MISERABLE LITTLE MAN WHO EMERGED FROM THE NARROW PASSAGE INTO THE BUSTLE OF THE BROAD THOROUGHFARE
AND TOO MUCH EXACT INFORMATION AS WELL TO DISMISS THEM AS ROT THE DUSK OF THIS NARROW LANE TOOK ON A SINISTER TINT FROM THE DARK FRAIL LITTLE FIGURE ITS BACK TO THE WALL
THE THOUGHT THAT WHEN CALLED URGENTLY TO HIS ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER'S PRIVATE ROOM HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL HIS ASTONISHMENT WAS DISTINCTLY VEXING HIS INSTINCT OF A SUCCESSFUL MAN HAD TAUGHT HIM LONG AGO THAT AS A GENERAL RULE
HE WAS IN A LONG STRAIGHT STREET PEOPLED BY A MERE FRACTION OF AN IMMENSE MULTITUDE
IT HAD THAT QUALITY OF SERIOUSNESS BELONGING TO EVERY FORM OF OPEN SPORT
IN ORDER TO REACH SOONER THE POINT WHERE HE COULD TAKE HIS OMNIBUS HE TURNED BRUSQUELY OUT OF THE POPULOUS STREET INTO A NARROW AND DUSKY ALLEY PAVED WITH FLAGSTONES
HIS IMAGINATION HAD BEEN FIRED EARLY BY THE TALES OF MEN RISING FROM THE DEPTHS OF POVERTY TO POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY AND AFFLUENCE THE EXTREME ALMOST ASCETIC PURITY OF HIS THOUGHT COMBINED WITH AN ASTOUNDING IGNORANCE OF WORLDLY CONDITIONS
DISGUISED INTO CREEDS THE PROFESSOR'S INDIGNATION FOUND IN ITSELF A FINAL CAUSE THAT ABSOLVED HIM FROM THE SIN OF TURNING TO DESTRUCTION AS THE AGENT OF HIS AMBITION
GRASPING LIGHTLY THE INDIA RUBBER BALL THE SUPREME GUARANTEE OF HIS SINISTER FREEDOM BUT AFTER A WHILE HE BECAME DISAGREEABLY AFFECTED BY THE SIGHT OF THE ROADWAY THRONGED WITH VEHICLES
AND THESE CONDEMNED OLD HOUSES WOULD MAKE A GOOD HEAP OF BRICKS WHERE YOU STAND YOU'LL NEVER GET ME AT SO LITTLE COST TO LIFE AND PROPERTY WHICH YOU ARE PAID TO PROTECT
THE STUNTED WEAKLY FIGURE BEFORE HIM SPOKE AT LAST I'VE NO DOUBT THE PAPERS WOULD GIVE YOU AN OBITUARY NOTICE THEN YOU KNOW BEST WHAT THAT WOULD BE WORTH TO YOU
LIKELY TO REMAIN FOR EVER UNKNOWN
BUT WITH A SERIOUSNESS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THE MIND OF CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS INACCESSIBLE TO IDEAS OF REVOLT BUT HIS THIEVES WERE NOT REBELS HIS BODILY VIGOUR HIS COOL INFLEXIBLE MANNER
STEPPED OUT WITH THE PURPOSEFUL BRISKNESS OF A MAN DISREGARDING INDEED THE INCLEMENCIES OF THE WEATHER BUT CONSCIOUS OF HAVING AN AUTHORISED MISSION ON THIS EARTH AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF HIS KIND ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE IMMENSE TOWN
THEY WERE HIS FELLOW CITIZENS GONE WRONG BECAUSE OF IMPERFECT EDUCATION CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT BELIEVED BUT ALLOWING FOR THAT DIFFERENCE HE COULD UNDERSTAND THE MIND OF A BURGLAR BECAUSE AS A MATTER OF FACT
KEEPING IN CHECK THIS MAN ARMED WITH THE DEFENSIVE MANDATE OF A MENACED SOCIETY MORE FORTUNATE THAN CALIGULA WHO WISHED THAT THE ROMAN SENATE HAD ONLY ONE HEAD FOR THE BETTER SATISFACTION OF HIS CRUEL LUST
HE HAD SWALLOWED A GOOD DEAL OF RAW UNWHOLESOME FOG IN THE PARK THEN HE HAD WALKED OVER TO THE HOSPITAL AND WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IN GREENWICH WAS CONCLUDED AT LAST HE HAD LOST HIS INCLINATION FOR FOOD NOT ACCUSTOMED
THAT IT WAS PERFECTLY DELIGHTFUL THE HIGH OFFICIAL BELIEVED THE DECLARATION WHICH CHIMED IN WITH HIS IDEA OF THE FITNESS OF THINGS HIS WISDOM WAS OF AN OFFICIAL KIND OR ELSE HE MIGHT HAVE REFLECTED UPON A MATTER NOT OF THEORY
HE'S ALL THERE EVERY BIT OF HIM IT WAS A JOB HE HAD BEEN THE FIRST MAN ON THE SPOT AFTER THE EXPLOSION HE MENTIONED THE FACT AGAIN HE HAD SEEN SOMETHING LIKE A HEAVY FLASH OF LIGHTNING IN THE FOG
AND CARRIED AN UMBRELLA HIS HAT TILTED BACK UNCOVERED A GOOD DEAL OF FOREHEAD WHICH APPEARED VERY WHITE IN THE DUSK IN THE DARK PATCHES OF THE ORBITS THE EYEBALLS GLIMMERED PIERCINGLY LONG DROOPING MOUSTACHES
CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT HAD BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE MORE ENERGETIC FORMS OF THIEVING HE HAD GAINED HIS SPURS IN THAT SPHERE AND NATURALLY ENOUGH HAD KEPT FOR IT AFTER HIS PROMOTION TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT A FEELING NOT VERY FAR REMOVED FROM AFFECTION
A CONVENIENT TRAIN WHIRLED HIM UP TO TOWN ALONE AND PONDERING DEEPLY IN A THIRD CLASS COMPARTMENT
LET HIM RUN ON THE HOSPITAL PORTER AND ANOTHER MAN TURNED DOWN THE CORNERS OF THE CLOTH AND STEPPED ASIDE THE CHIEF INSPECTOR'S EYES SEARCHED THE GRUESOME DETAIL OF THAT HEAP OF MIXED THINGS
WE KNOW WHAT EACH OF THEM IS DOING HOUR BY HOUR HE HAD DECLARED AND THE HIGH OFFICIAL HAD DEIGNED TO SMILE THIS WAS SO OBVIOUSLY THE RIGHT THING TO SAY FOR AN OFFICER OF CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT'S REPUTATION
HE WAS HUMAN BUT CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS ALSO A MAN AND HE COULD NOT LET SUCH WORDS PASS ALL THIS IS GOOD TO FRIGHTEN CHILDREN WITH HE SAID I'LL HAVE YOU YET
THE ATROCIOUS ALLUSIVENESS OF THE WORDS HAD ITS EFFECT ON CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT
AUTHORITIES FREE FROM ALL TAINT OF HATE AND DESPAIR AFTER PAYING THIS TRIBUTE TO WHAT IS NORMAL IN THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIETY
AND THE SLIGHTLY ANXIOUS ATTENTION OF AN INDIGENT CUSTOMER BENDING OVER WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE BY PRODUCTS OF A BUTCHER'S SHOP WITH A VIEW TO AN INEXPENSIVE SUNDAY DINNER
AND RECALLING THE PROFESSOR CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WITHOUT CHECKING HIS SWINGING PACE MUTTERED THROUGH HIS TEETH LUNATIC CATCHING THIEVES WAS ANOTHER MATTER ALTOGETHER
MORE OR LESS DEPLORABLE DOES HAPPEN BUT THE HIGH OFFICIAL CARRIED AWAY BY HIS SENSE OF THE FITNESS OF THINGS
IT WAS AS IF FATE HAD THRUST THAT CLUE INTO HIS HANDS AND AFTER THE MANNER OF THE AVERAGE MAN WHOSE AMBITION IS TO COMMAND EVENTS HE BEGAN TO MISTRUST SUCH A GRATUITOUS AND ACCIDENTAL SUCCESS
DISORDERLY WITHOUT THE HUMAN EXCUSE OF DRUNKENNESS WHICH AT ANY RATE IMPLIES GOOD FEELING AND AN AMIABLE LEANING TOWARDS FESTIVITY AS CRIMINALS ANARCHISTS WERE DISTINCTLY NO CLASS NO CLASS AT ALL
I DON'T THINK I MISSED A SINGLE PIECE AS BIG AS A POSTAGE STAMP AT THIS POINT THE TRAINED FACULTIES OF THE CHIEF INSPECTOR CEASED TO HEAR THE VOICE OF THE CONSTABLE HE MOVED TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS FOR BETTER LIGHT
FOR A MAN OF REAL CONVICTIONS THIS IS A FINE OPPORTUNITY OF SELF SACRIFICE YOU MAY NOT FIND ANOTHER SO FAVOURABLE SO HUMANE THERE ISN'T EVEN A CAT NEAR US
SHELTERING THE ATROCIOUS INJUSTICE OF SOCIETY OF HUMBLE ORIGIN AND WITH AN APPEARANCE REALLY SO MEAN AS TO STAND IN THE WAY OF HIS CONSIDERABLE NATURAL ABILITIES
JUST BECAUSE IT SEEMED FORCED UPON HIM THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF SUCCESS DEPENDS NOT A LITTLE ON THE WAY YOU LOOK AT IT BUT FATE LOOKS AT NOTHING IT HAS NO DISCRETION
WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN COLLECTED IN SHAMBLES AND RAG SHOPS YOU USED A SHOVEL HE REMARKED OBSERVING A SPRINKLING OF SMALL GRAVEL TINY BROWN BITS OF BARK
HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY CURIOUS BEFORE THE PUBLIC HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO VINDICATE THE EFFICIENCY OF HIS DEPARTMENT
AND TOOK UP THE LEAST SOILED OF THE RAGS IT WAS A NARROW STRIP OF VELVET WITH A LARGER TRIANGULAR PIECE OF DARK BLUE CLOTH HANGING FROM IT HE HELD IT UP TO HIS EYES AND THE POLICE CONSTABLE SPOKE VELVET COLLAR
AND THE CELEBRATED CHIEF INSPECTOR FELT A SENSE OF SUPERIORITY WHICH INDUCED HIM TO RAISE A WARNING FINGER GIVE IT UP WHATEVER IT IS HE SAID IN AN ADMONISHING TONE
HE HAD NOT BEEN THINKING OF THE PROFESSOR HE HAD NOT BEEN THINKING OF ANY INDIVIDUAL ANARCHIST AT ALL THE COMPLEXION OF THAT CASE HAD SOMEHOW FORCED UPON HIM THE GENERAL IDEA OF THE ABSURDITY OF THINGS HUMAN
THE POPULATION OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND EVEN THE TEEMING MILLIONS STRUGGLING UPON THE PLANET WERE WITH HIM DOWN TO THE VERY THIEVES AND MENDICANTS YES THE THIEVES THEMSELVES WERE SURE TO BE WITH HIM IN HIS PRESENT WORK
THAT HOWEVER APPEARED IMPOSSIBLE THE FIRST TERM OF THE PROBLEM WAS UNREADABLE LACKED ALL SUGGESTION BUT THAT OF ATROCIOUS CRUELTY OVERCOMING HIS PHYSICAL REPUGNANCE
THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF UNIVERSAL SUPPORT IN HIS GENERAL ACTIVITY HEARTENED HIM TO GRAPPLE WITH THE PARTICULAR PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE CHIEF INSPECTOR WAS THAT OF MANAGING THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF HIS DEPARTMENT HIS IMMEDIATE SUPERIOR
SHE TOOK NO PARTICULAR NOTICE OF THE BIG ONE BUT THE OTHER WAS A FAIR SLIGHT CHAP CARRYING A TIN VARNISH CAN IN ONE HAND THE CONSTABLE CEASED KNOW THE WOMAN MUTTERED THE CHIEF INSPECTOR
I AM DOING MY WORK BETTER THAN YOU'RE DOING YOURS THAT'LL DO NOW INTERRUPTED CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT HURRIEDLY
THE FACT OF THE OUTRAGE BEING ATTEMPTED LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER HE HAD ASSURED A HIGH OFFICIAL THAT NO OUTBREAK OF ANARCHIST ACTIVITY WAS TO BE APPREHENDED WAS SUFFICIENTLY ANNOYING IF HE EVER THOUGHT HIMSELF SAFE IN MAKING A STATEMENT IT WAS THEN
AND THE DEVOTED LOYALTY OF TRUSTED SERVANTS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF AFFECTIONATE CONTEMPT WHICH KEEPS IT SWEET AS IT WERE BY A BENEVOLENT PROVISION OF NATURE NO MAN IS A HERO TO HIS VALET
BUT IN WHAT MAY BE BRIEFLY DEFINED IN ITS OWN SPECIAL PHRASEOLOGY AS SEVEN YEARS HARD CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS OF COURSE NOT INSENSIBLE TO THE GRAVITY OF MORAL DIFFERENCES
TO ARTISTS POLITICIANS THINKERS REFORMERS OR SAINTS A DESPICABLE EMOTIONAL STATE THIS AGAINST WHICH SOLITUDE FORTIFIES A SUPERIOR CHARACTER AND WITH
CHECKED HIS SWINGING PACE SUDDENLY HALLO HE SAID AND STOOD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE WATCHFULLY THE PROFESSOR HAD ALREADY STOPPED WITH A READY HALF TURN WHICH BROUGHT HIS SHOULDERS VERY NEAR THE OTHER WALL
A MAN SUPREMELY CONFIDENT IN THE PRIVILEGES OF HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS IN THE SON INDIVIDUALIST BY TEMPERAMENT ONCE THE SCIENCE OF COLLEGES HAD REPLACED THOROUGHLY THE FAITH OF CONVENTICLES
WHOSE MORALITY WAS ARTIFICIAL CORRUPT AND BLASPHEMOUS
IT WAS LABOUR WHOSE PRACTICAL DIFFERENCE FROM THE OTHER FORMS OF LABOUR CONSISTED IN THE NATURE OF ITS RISK WHICH DID NOT LIE IN ANKYLOSIS OR LEAD POISONING OR FIRE DAMP OR GRITTY DUST
BUT HAVEN'T YOU MADE YOUR NAME SIMPLY BY NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE ARE AFTER
HE HAD GONE EVEN SO FAR AS TO UTTER WORDS WHICH TRUE WISDOM WOULD HAVE KEPT BACK BUT CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT WAS NOT VERY WISE AT LEAST NOT TRULY SO TRUE WISDOM
THE CHIEF INSPECTOR STOOPING GUARDEDLY OVER THE TABLE FOUGHT DOWN THE UNPLEASANT SENSATION IN HIS THROAT THE SHATTERING VIOLENCE OF DESTRUCTION WHICH HAD MADE OF THAT BODY A HEAP OF NAMELESS FRAGMENTS
HE HAD MADE THAT STATEMENT WITH INFINITE SATISFACTION TO HIMSELF BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE HIGH OFFICIAL DESIRED GREATLY TO HEAR THAT VERY THING
AND ONLY AFTER STUFFING IT INTO HIS POCKET TURNED ROUND TO THE ROOM AND FLUNG THE VELVET COLLAR BACK ON THE TABLE COVER UP HE DIRECTED THE ATTENDANTS CURTLY WITHOUT ANOTHER LOOK
ARRESTED WITHIN SIX PACES OF THE ANARCHIST NICK NAMED THE PROFESSOR GAVE A THOUGHT OF REGRET TO THE WORLD OF THIEVES SANE WITHOUT MORBID IDEALS WORKING BY ROUTINE RESPECTFUL OF CONSTITUTED
HALF CONCEALING WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN ACCUMULATION OF RAW MATERIAL FOR A CANNIBAL FEAST IT REQUIRED CONSIDERABLE FIRMNESS OF MIND NOT TO RECOIL BEFORE THAT SIGHT CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT AN EFFICIENT OFFICER OF HIS DEPARTMENT
EXCEPT BY SOME FORM OF COLLECTIVE OR INDIVIDUAL VIOLENCE WAS PRECISE AND CORRECT HE WAS A MORAL AGENT THAT WAS SETTLED IN HIS MIND BY EXERCISING HIS AGENCY WITH RUTHLESS DEFIANCE
PRINCIPAL EXPERT IN ANARCHIST PROCEDURE THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCE WHOSE RECOLLECTION DEPRESSED THE USUAL SERENITY OF THE EMINENT SPECIALIST THERE WAS ANOTHER DATING BACK ONLY TO THAT VERY MORNING
THE MIND AND THE INSTINCTS OF A BURGLAR ARE OF THE SAME KIND AS THE MIND AND THE INSTINCTS OF A POLICE OFFICER BOTH RECOGNISE THE SAME CONVENTIONS AND HAVE A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER'S METHODS AND OF THE ROUTINE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE TRADES
HE BEHELD IN THAT ONE MAN ALL THE FORCES HE HAD SET AT DEFIANCE THE FORCE OF LAW PROPERTY OPPRESSION AND INJUSTICE HE BEHELD ALL HIS ENEMIES AND FEARLESSLY CONFRONTED THEM ALL IN A SUPREME SATISFACTION OF HIS VANITY
CHAPTER FIVE THE PROFESSOR HAD TURNED INTO A STREET TO THE LEFT AND WALKED ALONG WITH HIS HEAD CARRIED RIGIDLY ERECT IN A CROWD WHOSE EVERY INDIVIDUAL ALMOST OVERTOPPED HIS STUNTED STATURE
CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT
SEVERE EXULTATION THE PROFESSOR THOUGHT OF THE REFUGE OF HIS ROOM WITH ITS PADLOCKED CUPBOARD LOST IN A WILDERNESS OF POOR HOUSES THE HERMITAGE OF THE PERFECT ANARCHIST
