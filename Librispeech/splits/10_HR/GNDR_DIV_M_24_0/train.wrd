THERE IS NOT A GOOD FILM IN THE WORLD BUT IS THE BETTER FOR BEING SEEN IN IMMEDIATE SUCCESSION TO ITSELF SIX REEL PROGRAMMES ARE A WEARINESS TO THE FLESH THE BEST OF THE OLD ONE REEL BIOGRAPHS OF GRIFFITH

A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR PREVENTING THE CHILDREN OF POOR PEOPLE IN IRELAND
FOR THIS KIND OF COMMODITY WILL NOT BEAR EXPORTATION AND FLESH BEING OF TOO TENDER A CONSISTENCE TO ADMIT A LONG CONTINUANCE IN SALT
AS TO MY SELF HAVING BEEN WEARIED OUT FOR MANY YEARS WITH OFFERING VAIN IDLE VISIONARY THOUGHTS AND AT LENGTH UTTERLY DESPAIRING OF SUCCESS I FORTUNATELY FELL UPON THIS PROPOSAL WHICH AS IT IS WHOLLY NEW
AND THE MOST INEVITABLE PROSPECT OF INTAILING THE LIKE OR GREATER MISERIES UPON THEIR BREED FOR EVER I PROFESS IN THE SINCERITY OF MY HEART
THAT IT WILL PREVENT THOSE VOLUNTARY ABORTIONS AND THAT HORRID PRACTICE OF WOMEN MURDERING THEIR BASTARD CHILDREN ALAS TOO FREQUENT AMONG US
IN THE SEATS NEAREST AND THE FREEZING HORROR OF THE TREASON SWEEPS FROM THE FORD'S THEATRE AUDIENCE TO THE REAL AUDIENCE BEYOND THEM THE REAL CROWD TOUCHED WITH TERROR BEHOLDS ITS NATURAL FACE
BECAUSE IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN THAT THEY ARE EVERY DAY DYING AND ROTTING BY COLD AND FAMINE AND FILTH AND VERMIN
ARE ESSENTIALLY PRIVATE PERSONS INDIVIDUALS IN EXTREMIS IF YOU GO TO A MOTION PICTURE AND FEEL YOURSELF SUDDENLY GRIPPED BY THE HIGHEST DRAMATIC TENSION AS ON THE OLD STAGE AND REFLECT AFTERWARD THAT IT WAS A FIGHT BETWEEN ONLY
STOP TO ANALYZE WHAT THEY STOOD FOR
THE ONSET IS UNEXPECTEDLY NEAR TO THE HOUSE WHERE ONCE WAS THE DANCE THE BOY IS AT FIRST A COWARD HE ENTERS THE OLD FAMILIAR DOOR HE APPEALS TO THE GIRL TO HIDE HIM
THE NUMBER OF SOULS IN THIS KINGDOM BEING USUALLY RECKONED ONE MILLION AND A HALF OF THESE I CALCULATE THERE MAY BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND COUPLE WHOSE WIVES ARE BREEDERS
BUYING THE CHILDREN ALIVE AND DRESSING THEM HOT FROM THE KNIFE AS WE DO ROASTING PIGS A VERY WORTHY PERSON
WHO PROTESTED TO ME THAT HE NEVER KNEW ABOVE ONE OR TWO INSTANCES UNDER THE AGE OF SIX EVEN IN A PART OF THE KINGDOM SO RENOWNED FOR THE QUICKEST PROFICIENCY IN THAT ART
ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS IN REGARD TO THE PHOTOPLAY HERE ARE TWO BITS FROM HIS DISCOURSE STRIKE THE DIALOGUE FROM MOLIERE'S TARTUFFE AND WHAT AUDIENCE WOULD BEAR ITS MERE STAGE BUSINESS
OF TWENTY MINUTES EACH THESE HAVE THE ADVANTAGE THAT IF THEY PLEASE AT ALL ONE CAN SEE THEM AGAIN AT ONCE WITHOUT
THAT I HAVE NOT THE LEAST PERSONAL INTEREST IN ENDEAVOURING TO PROMOTE THIS NECESSARY WORK HAVING NO OTHER MOTIVE THAN THE PUBLICK GOOD OF MY COUNTRY BY ADVANCING OUR TRADE PROVIDING FOR INFANTS RELIEVING THE POOR
ONLY THE GIRL KNOWS HE WAS FIRST A FAILURE THE WOUNDED GENERAL HONORS HIM AS THE HERO ABOVE ALL NOW SHE IS RADIANT SHE CANNOT HELP BUT BE TRIUMPHANT
I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THEM GROSSLY MISTAKEN IN THEIR COMPUTATION IT IS TRUE A CHILD JUST DROPT FROM ITS DAM MAY BE SUPPORTED BY HER MILK FOR A SOLAR YEAR WITH LITTLE OTHER NOURISHMENT
IT IS OF A MUCH GREATER EXTENT
NOR OFFER TO BEAT OR KICK THEM AS IS TOO FREQUENT A PRACTICE FOR FEAR OF A MISCARRIAGE MANY OTHER ADVANTAGES MIGHT BE ENUMERATED FOR INSTANCE
AND THEREBY HAVE AVOIDED SUCH A PERPETUAL SCENE OF MISFORTUNES AS THEY HAVE SINCE GONE THROUGH BY THE OPPRESSION OF LANDLORDS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF PAYING RENT WITHOUT MONEY OR TRADE THE WANT OF COMMON SUSTENANCE
GLIMPSES OF THE BATTLE ARE GIVEN WITH A SPLENDOR THAT ONLY GRIFFITH HAS ATTAINED BLANCHE SWEET
SACRIFICING THE POOR INNOCENT BABES I DOUBT MORE TO AVOID THE EXPENCE THAN THE SHAME WHICH WOULD MOVE TEARS AND PITY IN THE MOST SAVAGE AND INHUMAN BREAST
FORMERLY DISABLED BY INCIDENTAL DEFICIENCIES OF ONE SORT OR ANOTHER THAT DO NOT MATTER IN THE PICTURE THEATRE
THEY CANNOT GET WORK AND CONSEQUENTLY PINE AWAY FROM WANT OF NOURISHMENT
ARCHITECTURE IN MOTION AND THE FIFTEENTH CHAPTER
ALTHOUGH PERHAPS I COULD NAME A COUNTRY WHICH WOULD BE GLAD TO EAT UP OUR WHOLE NATION WITHOUT IT AFTER ALL I AM NOT SO VIOLENTLY BENT UPON MY OWN OPINION AS TO REJECT ANY OFFER PROPOSED BY WISE MEN
TO FIGHT FOR THE PRETENDER IN SPAIN OR SELL THEMSELVES TO THE BARBADOES
CANNOT STIR ABROAD WITHOUT A CHAIR
THAT HAD BEEN PURSUING EACH OTHER EARLIER IN THE FILM OTHERWISE THE CONFLICT HOWEVER VIOLENT APPEALED MAINLY TO THE SENSE OF SPEED SO
I GRANT THIS FOOD WILL BE SOMEWHAT DEAR AND THEREFORE VERY PROPER FOR LANDLORDS WHO AS THEY HAVE ALREADY DEVOURED MOST OF THE PARENTS SEEM TO HAVE THE BEST TITLE TO THE CHILDREN INFANT'S FLESH WILL BE IN SEASON THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
AND FOR NO OTHER THAT EVER WAS IS OR I THINK EVER CAN BE UPON EARTH THEREFORE LET NO MAN TALK TO ME OF OTHER EXPEDIENTS
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A BEVY OF VILLAGE LOVERS IS CONVEYED IN A LIVELY SWEET HEARTING DANCE THEN THE BOY AND HIS COMRADES GO FORTH TO WAR THE LINES PASS BETWEEN HAND WAVING CROWDS OF FRIENDS
BLACK CATTLE OR SWINE AND MY REASON IS THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE SELDOM THE FRUITS OF MARRIAGE A CIRCUMSTANCE NOT MUCH REGARDED BY OUR SAVAGES THEREFORE ONE MALE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SERVE FOUR FEMALES
BUT IT IS GRIFFITH'S GREAT FILM THE BATTLE
IMPERSONATED BY HENRY B WALTHALL ENTERS NOT AS AN INDIVIDUAL BUT AS REPRESENTING THE WHOLE ANGLO SAXON NIAGARA HE HAS THE MASK OF THE KU KLUX KLAN ON HIS FACE
WILL BE PLEASED MATURELY TO CONSIDER TWO POINTS FIRST AS THINGS NOW STAND HOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO FIND FOOD
WHICH THE MOTHER MAY CERTAINLY GET OR THE VALUE IN SCRAPS BY HER LAWFUL OCCUPATION OF BEGGING AND IT IS EXACTLY AT ONE YEAR OLD THAT I PROPOSE TO PROVIDE FOR THEM
TO BRING US THESE PANORAMIC DRAMA ELEMENTS BY THE LAW OF COMPENSATION WHILE THE MOTION PICTURE IS SHALLOW IN SHOWING PRIVATE PASSION IT IS POWERFUL IN CONVEYING THE PASSIONS OF MASSES OF MEN BERNARD SHAW
NOT EXCEEDING FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOR UNDER TWELVE SO GREAT A NUMBER OF BOTH SEXES IN EVERY COUNTRY BEING NOW READY TO STARVE FOR WANT OF WORK AND SERVICE AND THESE TO BE DISPOSED OF BY THEIR PARENTS IF ALIVE
AND FOR THE TIME BREAKS HER HEART HE GOES FORTH A FUGITIVE NOT ONLY FROM BATTLE BUT FROM HER TERRIBLE GIRLISH ANGER BUT LATER HE RALLIES HE
BRINGS A TRAIN OF POWDER WAGONS THROUGH FIRES BUILT IN HIS PATH BY THE ENEMY'S SCOUTS HE LOSES EVERY ONE OF HIS MEN AND ALL BUT THE LAST WAGON WHICH HE DRIVES HIMSELF HIS RETURN WITH THAT AMMUNITION SAVES THE HARD FOUGHT DAY
AND WHEN HE WILL GO TO THE PICTURE SHOW TO VERIFY IT THE SHODDIEST SILENT DRAMA MAY CONTAIN NOBLE VIEWS OF THE SEA THIS PART IS ALMOST SURE TO BE GOOD IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL RESOURCE
LASTLY OF PUTTING A SPIRIT OF HONESTY INDUSTRY AND SKILL INTO OUR SHOP KEEPERS WHO
AND GROW POPULAR AMONG HIS TENANTS THE MOTHER WILL HAVE EIGHT SHILLINGS NEAT PROFIT AND BE FIT FOR WORK TILL SHE PRODUCES ANOTHER CHILD THOSE WHO ARE MORE THRIFTY AS I MUST CONFESS THE TIMES REQUIRE
YET THE SEA OF HUMANITY IS DRAMATICALLY BLOOD BROTHER TO THE PACIFIC ATLANTIC OR MEDITERRANEAN
WHERE ARE WE GOING THE CROWD SCARE THE STRIKE AN INVENTION FOR MAKING CROWDS THINK THE CROWD'S IMAGINATION ABOUT PEOPLE SPEAKING AS ONE OF THE CROWD
WELL BE DIPPED INTO BY THE READER BEFORE HE GOES TO SUCH A PLAY AS THE ITALIAN OR THE BATTLE IS THE WORK WHICH BEARS THE TITLE OF THIS CHAPTER CROWDS
WOULD FALL FLAT IN MOTION PICTURES THE MINOR SITUATIONS OF DRAMATIC INTENSITY MIGHT IN MANY CASES BE BUILT UP THE CRISIS WOULD INEVITABLY FAIL IAGO AND OTHELLO AND LEAR
AGAINST THEIR CONSCIENCE TO AN EPISCOPAL CURATE SECONDLY THE POORER TENANTS WILL HAVE SOMETHING VALUABLE OF THEIR OWN WHICH BY LAW
NOTE IN ESPECIAL WHAT SHAW SAYS ABOUT NARRATIVE EPIC AND PARADISE LOST HE HAS IN MIND NO DOUBT THE POURING HOSTS OF DEMONS AND ANGELS THIS IS
BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF POPISH INFANTS IS AT LEAST THREE TO ONE IN THIS KINGDOM AND THEREFORE IT WILL HAVE ONE OTHER COLLATERAL ADVANTAGE BY LESSENING THE NUMBER OF PAPISTS AMONG US
SOMETHING THE PHOTOPLAYS THAT TRACE STRICTLY PERSONAL HATREDS CANNOT ACHIEVE THE BIRTH OF A NATION IS A CROWD PICTURE IN A TRIPLE SENSE ON THE FILMS AS IN THE AUDIENCE
AND WHEN THE FAMILY DINES ALONE THE FORE OR HIND QUARTER WILL MAKE A REASONABLE DISH AND SEASONED WITH A LITTLE PEPPER OR SALT WILL BE VERY GOOD BOILED ON THE FOURTH DAY ESPECIALLY IN WINTER
THROUGH FIVE OTHER REELS OF A MIXED PROGRAMME THAT USUALLY IS BAD THAT IS THE REASON ONE REEL MASTERPIECES SELDOM APPEAR NOW THE PRODUCER IN A MOOD TO MAKE A SPECIAL EFFORT
WHO ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR OWN CHILDREN ALTHOUGH I APPREHEND THERE CANNOT BE SO MANY UNDER THE PRESENT DISTRESSES OF THE KINGDOM BUT THIS BEING GRANTED THERE WILL REMAIN
IN THE GLASS LATER
THE BIRTH OF A NATION READ THE FOURTEENTH CHAPTER ENTITLED THE ORCHESTRA CONVERSATION AND THE CENSORSHIP
THE ORIGINAL BOOK BY THOMAS DIXON IT IS BAD WHEREVER IT IS UNADULTERATED GRIFFITH WHICH IS HALF THE TIME IT IS GOOD THE REVEREND THOMAS DIXON IS A RATHER STAGY SIMON LEGREE IN HIS AVOWED VIEWS A
I RECOMMEND THEIR WORKS TO HIM AS A BETTER BASIS FOR FUTURE SOUTHERN SCENARIOS THE BIRTH OF A NATION HAS BEEN VERY PROPERLY DENOUNCED FOR ITS SIMON LEGREE QUALITIES BY FRANCIS HACKETT JANE ADDAMS AND OTHERS
FULL IN OUR OWN POWER AND WHEREBY WE CAN INCUR NO DANGER
THIS WOULD BE A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO MARRIAGE WHICH ALL WISE NATIONS HAVE EITHER ENCOURAGED BY REWARDS OR ENFORCED BY LAWS AND PENALTIES IT WOULD ENCREASE THE CARE AND TENDERNESS OF MOTHERS TOWARDS THEIR CHILDREN
AND IN GONDOLAS IT GIVES OUT THE ATMOSPHERE OF TOWN CROWD HAPPINESS
EXCEPT WHERE THEY ARE OF TOWARDLY PARTS ALTHOUGH I CONFESS THEY LEARN THE RUDIMENTS MUCH EARLIER DURING WHICH TIME THEY CAN HOWEVER BE PROPERLY LOOKED UPON ONLY AS PROBATIONERS
AND I HAVE BEEN DESIRED TO EMPLOY MY THOUGHTS WHAT COURSE MAY BE TAKEN TO EASE THE NATION OF SO GRIEVOUS AN INCUMBRANCE BUT I AM NOT IN THE LEAST PAIN UPON THAT MATTER
THE BATTLE IN THE END IS GREATER BECAUSE OF ITS SELF POSSESSION AND CONCENTRATION ALL PACKED INTO TWENTY MINUTES WHEN IN THE BIRTH OF A NATION LINCOLN
THIS I FREELY OWN AND TWAS INDEED ONE PRINCIPAL DESIGN IN OFFERING IT TO THE WORLD I DESIRE THE READER WILL OBSERVE THAT I CALCULATE MY REMEDY FOR THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL KINGDOM OF IRELAND
AN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND BREEDERS I AGAIN SUBTRACT FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THOSE WOMEN WHO MISCARRY OR WHOSE CHILDREN DIE BY ACCIDENT OR DISEASE WITHIN THE YEAR
GOES DOWN BEFORE THE ASSASSIN IT IS A MASTER SCENE HE FALLS AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT AND A THOUSAND HIGH AND NOBLE CROWD ASPIRATIONS THE MIMIC AUDIENCE IN THE RESTORED FORD'S THEATRE RISES IN PANIC
TILL THE CRISIS HAS PASSED THE WRATH OF THE SOUTHERNER AGAINST THE BLACKS AND THEIR NORTHERN ORGANIZERS HAS BEEN PILED UP THROUGH MANY PREVIOUS SCENES
DRAB EAST SIDE THE GONDOLIER BECOMES BOOT BLACK THE GRAPE GATHERING PEASANT GIRL BECOMES THE SUFFERING SLUM MOTHER THEY ARE NOT SPECIALIZED CHARACTERS LIKE PENDENNIS OR BECKY SHARP IN THE NOVELS OF THACKERAY
AN OLD GRIFFITH BIOGRAPH FIRST ISSUED IN NINETEEN ELEVEN BEFORE GRIFFITH'S NAME OR THAT OF ANY ACTOR IN FILMS WAS ADVERTISED BLANCHE SWEET IS THE LEADING LADY AND CHARLES H WEST THE LEADING MAN
IT TURNS THE CROWD INTO A MOB THAT IS EITHER FOR OR AGAINST THE REVEREND THOMAS DIXON'S POISONOUS HATRED OF THE NEGRO GRIFFITH IS A CHAMELEON IN INTERPRETING HIS AUTHORS WHEREVER THE SCENARIO SHOWS TRACES OF THE CLANSMAN
I HAVE ALREADY COMPUTED THE CHARGE OF NURSING A BEGGAR'S CHILD
THESE MOTHERS INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO WORK FOR THEIR HONEST LIVELIHOOD ARE FORCED TO EMPLOY ALL THEIR TIME IN STROLING TO BEG SUSTENANCE FOR THEIR HELPLESS INFANTS WHO
OF BEING A LITTLE CAUTIOUS NOT TO SELL OUR COUNTRY AND CONSCIENCES FOR NOTHING
THE QUESTION THEREFORE IS HOW THIS NUMBER SHALL BE REARED AND PROVIDED FOR WHICH AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID UNDER THE PRESENT SITUATION OF AFFAIRS IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE BY ALL THE METHODS HITHERTO PROPOSED
AT A CERTAIN AGE WHO ARE BORN OF PARENTS IN EFFECT AS LITTLE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM AS THOSE WHO DEMAND OUR CHARITY IN THE STREETS AS TO MY OWN PART HAVING TURNED MY THOUGHTS FOR MANY YEARS UPON THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT
CHAPTER FIVE THE PICTURE OF CROWD SPLENDOR
AND THAT IN HIS TIME THE BODY OF A PLUMP GIRL OF FIFTEEN WHO WAS CRUCIFIED FOR AN ATTEMPT TO POISON THE EMPEROR WAS SOLD TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY'S PRIME MINISTER OF STATE AND OTHER GREAT MANDARINS OF THE COURT
BUT IT IS STILL TRUE THAT IT IS A WONDER IN ITS GRIFFITH SECTIONS IN ITS HANDLING OF MASSES OF MEN IT FURTHER ILLUSTRATES THE PRINCIPLES THAT MADE NOTABLE THE OLD ONE REEL BATTLE FILM DESCRIBED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS CHAPTER
WHO CAME FROM THENCE TO LONDON ABOVE TWENTY YEARS AGO AND IN CONVERSATION TOLD MY FRIEND THAT IN HIS COUNTRY WHEN ANY YOUNG PERSON HAPPENED TO BE PUT TO DEATH THE EXECUTIONER SOLD THE CARCASS TO PERSONS OF QUALITY AS A PRIME DAINTY
THEIR CORN AND CATTLE BEING ALREADY SEIZED AND MONEY A THING UNKNOWN THIRDLY WHEREAS THE MAINTAINANCE OF AN HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM TWO YEARS OLD AND UPWARDS CANNOT BE COMPUTED AT LESS THAN TEN SHILLINGS A PIECE PER ANNUM
BUT IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY MY FRIEND HE CONFESSED THAT THIS EXPEDIENT WAS PUT INTO HIS HEAD BY THE FAMOUS SALMANAAZOR A NATIVE OF THE ISLAND FORMOSA
I DO THEREFORE HUMBLY OFFER IT TO PUBLICK CONSIDERATION THAT OF THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN ALREADY COMPUTED TWENTY THOUSAND MAY BE RESERVED FOR BREED WHEREOF ONLY ONE FOURTH PART TO BE MALES
AND TO FATTEN THEM WOULD NOT ANSWER THE CHARGE
THEY HAVE NOT STRENGTH TO PERFORM IT AND THUS THE COUNTRY AND THEMSELVES ARE HAPPILY DELIVERED FROM THE EVILS TO COME I HAVE TOO LONG DIGRESSED AND THEREFORE SHALL RETURN TO MY SUBJECT
IMPRACTICABLE ON THE STAGE PARADISE LOST WOULD MAKE A FAR BETTER FILM THAN IBSEN'S JOHN GABRIEL BORKMAN THOUGH BORKMAN IS A DRAMATIC MASTERPIECE AND MILTON COULD NOT WRITE AN EFFECTIVE PLAY
ADDING THOSE WHO ARE BEGGARS BY PROFESSION TO THE BULK OF FARMERS COTTAGERS AND LABOURERS WITH THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN WHO ARE BEGGARS IN EFFECT I DESIRE THOSE POLITICIANS WHO DISLIKE MY OVERTURE
AS TO OUR CITY OF DUBLIN SHAMBLES MAY BE APPOINTED FOR THIS PURPOSE IN THE MOST CONVENIENT PARTS OF IT AND BUTCHERS WE MAY BE ASSURED WILL NOT BE WANTING ALTHOUGH I RATHER RECOMMEND
WILL BECOME SACRED IN EACH OTHER'S EYES IN PICTURES AND IN FACT A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS THEME ON OTHER PLANES
FOR AS TO THE MALES MY AMERICAN ACQUAINTANCE ASSURED ME FROM FREQUENT EXPERIENCE THAT THEIR FLESH WAS GENERALLY TOUGH AND LEAN LIKE THAT OF OUR SCHOOL BOYS BY CONTINUAL EXERCISE AND THEIR TASTE DISAGREEABLE
I THINK THE ADVANTAGES BY THE PROPOSAL WHICH I HAVE MADE ARE OBVIOUS AND MANY AS WELL AS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE FOR FIRST AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED
WHICH SHALL BE FOUND EQUALLY INNOCENT CHEAP EASY AND EFFECTUAL BUT BEFORE SOMETHING OF THAT KIND SHALL BE ADVANCED IN CONTRADICTION TO MY SCHEME AND OFFERING A BETTER I DESIRE THE AUTHOR OR AUTHORS
WHO CAN WRITE NOVELS AND EPICS BUT CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF THEM WRITE PLAYS WELL THE FILM LENDS ITSELF ADMIRABLY TO THE SUCCESSION OF EVENTS PROPER TO NARRATIVE AND EPIC BUT PHYSICALLY
VANITY IDLENESS AND GAMING IN OUR WOMEN OF INTRODUCING A VEIN OF PARSIMONY PRUDENCE AND TEMPERANCE OF LEARNING TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY WHEREIN WE DIFFER EVEN FROM LAPLANDERS AND THE INHABITANTS OF
WHAT BECOMES OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHAKESPEARE AND SHERIDAN KNOWLES IN THE FILM OR BETWEEN SHAKESPEARE'S LEAR AND ANY ONE ELSE'S LEAR NO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ALL THE INTEREST LIES IN THE NEW OPENING
THE PROPAGATION OF SWINE'S FLESH AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE ART OF MAKING GOOD BACON SO MUCH WANTED AMONG US BY THE GREAT DESTRUCTION OF PIGS TOO FREQUENT AT OUR TABLES
THE MEASURE AND THE GOODNESS NOR COULD EVER YET BE BROUGHT TO MAKE ONE FAIR PROPOSAL OF JUST DEALING THOUGH OFTEN AND EARNESTLY INVITED TO IT THEREFORE I REPEAT
CONTAINED MORE IN TWENTY MINUTES THAN THESE AMBITIOUS INCONTINENT SIX REEL DISPLAYS GIVE US IN TWO HOURS
AND THE WHOLE BODY SOCIAL OF THE VILLAGE HOW THE COSTUMES FLASH AND THE HANDKERCHIEFS WAVE AROUND HER
THIS FOOD WOULD LIKEWISE BRING GREAT CUSTOM TO TAVERNS WHERE THE VINTNERS WILL CERTAINLY BE SO PRUDENT AS TO PROCURE THE BEST RECEIPTS FOR DRESSING IT TO PERFECTION AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE THEIR HOUSES FREQUENTED BY ALL THE FINE GENTLEMEN
IT WOULD GREATLY LESSEN THE NUMBER OF PAPISTS WITH WHOM WE ARE YEARLY OVER RUN BEING THE PRINCIPAL BREEDERS OF THE NATION AS WELL AS OUR MOST DANGEROUS ENEMIES AND WHO
AND THE ROYAL FAMILY AND THE MONARCHY BEING RESTORED HAD FLOCKED TO LONDON TO SETTLE IN BUSINESS OR TO DEPEND UPON AND ATTEND THE COURT FOR REWARDS OF SERVICES PREFERMENTS AND THE LIKE
COACHES FILLED WITH PEOPLE OF THE BETTER SORT AND HORSEMEN ATTENDING THEM AND ALL HURRYING AWAY THEN EMPTY WAGGONS AND CARTS APPEARED AND SPARE HORSES WITH SERVANTS WHO IT WAS APPARENT
THAT WOULD SURROUND ME AND THAT IF I ATTEMPTED TO SECURE MYSELF BY FLEEING FROM MY HABITATION AND ACTED CONTRARY TO THESE INTIMATIONS WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE DIVINE IT WAS A KIND OF
TWENTY MORE WHO WERE REALLY DEAD OF THE PLAGUE IN THAT PARISH BUT HAD BEEN SET DOWN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER OR OTHER DISTEMPERS BESIDES OTHERS CONCEALED
SO THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN THEM EXTRAORDINARY AND I OUGHT TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT DID NOT EVIDENTLY POINT OUT OR INTIMATE TO ME THAT IT WAS THE WILL OF HEAVEN I SHOULD NOT GO
AND IT WAS MEET HE SHOULD DO WITH ME AS SHOULD SEEM GOOD TO HIM WITH THIS RESOLUTION I WENT TO BED
WAS SUCH THAT THE TOWN WAS COMPUTED TO HAVE IN IT ABOVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MORE THAN EVER IT HELD BEFORE NAY SOME TOOK UPON THEM TO SAY IT HAD TWICE AS MANY BECAUSE
BUT THIS WAS ALL KNAVERY AND COLLUSION
FOR SAYS HE IS IT NOT AS REASONABLE THAT YOU SHOULD TRUST GOD WITH THE CHANCE OR RISK OF LOSING YOUR TRADE AS THAT YOU SHOULD STAY IN SO EMINENT A POINT OF DANGER AND TRUST HIM WITH YOUR LIFE I COULD NOT
TO NOTE WHAT BECAME OF ME I HAD TWO IMPORTANT THINGS BEFORE ME
THAT IF I HAD BEEN A STRANGER AND AT A LOSS FOR MY WAY I MIGHT SOMETIMES HAVE GONE THE LENGTH OF A WHOLE STREET I MEAN OF THE BY STREETS AND SEEN NOBODY TO DIRECT ME
TWO PHYSICIANS AND A SURGEON WERE ORDERED TO GO TO THE HOUSE AND MAKE INSPECTION THIS THEY DID AND FINDING EVIDENT TOKENS OF THE SICKNESS UPON BOTH THE BODIES THAT WERE DEAD
SO THAT NOW ALL OUR EXTENUATIONS ABATED AND IT WAS NO MORE TO BE CONCEALED NAY IT QUICKLY APPEARED THAT THE INFECTION HAD SPREAD ITSELF BEYOND ALL HOPES OF ABATEMENT THAT IN THE PARISH OF SAINT GILES
SO FULLY BECAUSE I KNOW NOT BUT IT MAY BE OF MOMENT TO THOSE WHO COME AFTER ME IF THEY COME TO BE BROUGHT TO THE SAME DISTRESS AND TO THE SAME MANNER OF MAKING THEIR CHOICE AND THEREFORE
I OUGHT TO ACQUIESCE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIM WHO HAVING BEEN MY MAKER HAD AN UNDISPUTED RIGHT OF SOVEREIGNTY IN DISPOSING OF ME AND THAT THEN THERE HAD BEEN
SAINT BRIDE'S EIGHT
AT THE SAME TIME IN LONDON AND NOT MANY YEARS BEFORE COME OVER FROM PORTUGAL AND ADVISING WITH HIM HIS ANSWER WAS IN THREE WORDS
MY BROTHER THOUGH A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN HIMSELF LAUGHED AT ALL I HAD SUGGESTED ABOUT ITS BEING AN INTIMATION FROM HEAVEN AND TOLD ME SEVERAL STORIES OF SUCH FOOLHARDY PEOPLE AS HE CALLED THEM
OF ALL DISTEMPERS WHEREOF IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED ABOVE SIX HUNDRED DIED OF THE PLAGUE YET THERE WAS BUT TWENTY EIGHT IN THE WHOLE CITY WITHIN THE WALLS AND BUT NINETEEN IN SOUTHWARK
SWEATED A LITTLE AND WAS MUCH REFRESHED THE APPREHENSIONS OF ITS BEING THE INFECTION WENT ALSO QUITE AWAY WITH MY ILLNESS AND I WENT ABOUT MY BUSINESS AS USUAL
WHAT WAS MY DUTY TO DO AND I STATED THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH MY BROTHER HAD PRESSED ME TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY AND I SET AGAINST THEM THE STRONG IMPRESSIONS WHICH I HAD ON MY MIND FOR STAYING THE VISIBLE CALL I SEEMED TO HAVE
I READ ON TO THE SEVENTH VERSE EXCLUSIVE AND AFTER THAT INCLUDED THE TENTH AS FOLLOWS I WILL SAY OF THE LORD HE IS MY REFUGE AND MY FORTRESS MY GOD
AND THAT WE HOPED WAS NOT TRUE TILL THE LATTER END OF NOVEMBER OR THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN TWO MEN SAID TO BE FRENCHMEN DIED OF THE PLAGUE IN LONG ACRE
YET BEING VERY ILL BOTH IN MY HEAD AND IN MY STOMACH I WAS NOT WITHOUT APPREHENSION THAT I REALLY WAS INFECTED BUT IN ABOUT THREE DAYS I GREW BETTER THE THIRD NIGHT I RESTED WELL
AND AT THAT JUNCTURE I HAPPENED TO STOP TURNING OVER THE BOOK
AND AS ALL TOGETHER REGARD THE QUESTION BEFORE HIM AND THEN I THINK HE MAY SAFELY TAKE THEM FOR INTIMATIONS FROM HEAVEN OF WHAT IS HIS UNQUESTIONED DUTY TO DO IN SUCH A CASE I MEAN
BUT STILL AS THERE WAS BUT ONE OF THE PLAGUE PEOPLE BEGAN TO BE EASY THE WHOLE BILL ALSO WAS VERY LOW FOR THE WEEK BEFORE THE BILL WAS BUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN
YET THERE DIED NO MORE OF THE PLAGUE ON THE WHOLE SOUTHWARK SIDE OF THE WATER THAN SIXTEEN BUT THIS FACE OF THINGS SOON CHANGED
A LITTLE HARDENED IT IS TRUE A VAST MANY PEOPLE FLED AS I HAVE OBSERVED YET THEY WERE CHIEFLY FROM THE WEST END OF THE TOWN AND FROM THAT WE CALL THE HEART OF THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY
AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THOUGH THEY WERE AT FIRST IN A MOST INEXPRESSIBLE CONSTERNATION YET AS I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE DISTEMPER INTERMITTED OFTEN AT FIRST SO THEY WERE AS IT WERE
THE WOMAN BEING TAKEN ILL WITH WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO ENTRUST MY HOUSE AND ALL MY AFFAIRS
AND SEVERAL COUNCILS WERE HELD ABOUT WAYS TO PREVENT ITS COMING OVER BUT ALL WAS KEPT VERY PRIVATE HENCE IT WAS THAT THIS RUMOUR DIED OFF AGAIN AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO FORGET IT AS A THING WE WERE VERY LITTLE CONCERNED IN
THIS POSSESSED THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE VERY MUCH AND FEW CARED TO GO THROUGH DRURY LANE OR THE OTHER STREETS SUSPECTED UNLESS THEY HAD EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS THAT OBLIGED THEM TO IT
SAINT JAMES'S SEVEN
BUT THEY WALKED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT STREET NEITHER ON ONE SIDE
MAGISTRATES AND SERVANTS LEFT IN THE CITY AS THEY FLED NOW OUT OF THE CITY SO I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT THE COURT REMOVED EARLY
SO I WAS PUT OFF FOR THAT TIME AND ONE WAY OR OTHER I ALWAYS FOUND THAT TO APPOINT TO GO AWAY WAS ALWAYS CROSSED BY SOME ACCIDENT OR OTHER SO AS TO DISAPPOINT AND PUT IT OFF AGAIN
MANUFACTURERS AND THE LIKE
BUT THEN MY SERVANT WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO TAKE DOWN WITH ME DECEIVED ME AND BEING FRIGHTED AT THE INCREASE OF THE DISTEMPER AND NOT KNOWING WHEN I SHOULD GO HE TOOK OTHER MEASURES AND LEFT ME
THE LIKE INCREASE OF THE BILLS WAS OBSERVED IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT BRIDE'S ADJOINING ON ONE SIDE OF HOLBORN PARISH AND IN THE PARISH OF SAINT JAMES CLERKENWELL ADJOINING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HOLBORN
AND I BEGAN TO RESOLVE TO GO AND ACCORDINGLY MADE ALL THINGS READY FOR IN SHORT THE INFECTION INCREASED ROUND ME
IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE ORDINARY BURIALS INCREASED IN NUMBER CONSIDERABLY FOR EXAMPLE FROM DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH TO JANUARY THIRD
FOR THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY WITHIN THE WALLS WAS INDIFFERENTLY HEALTHY STILL NOR WAS IT GOT THEN VERY MUCH OVER THE WATER INTO SOUTHWARK
SPREAD RUMOURS AND REPORTS OF THINGS AND TO IMPROVE THEM BY THE INVENTION OF MEN AS I HAVE LIVED TO SEE PRACTISED SINCE
BUT AFTER THAT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY ANOTHER DIED IN ANOTHER HOUSE BUT IN THE SAME PARISH AND IN THE SAME MANNER THIS TURNED THE PEOPLE'S EYES PRETTY MUCH TOWARDS THAT END OF THE TOWN
THIS HURRY OF THE PEOPLE WAS SUCH FOR SOME WEEKS THAT THERE WAS NO GETTING AT THE LORD MAYOR'S DOOR WITHOUT EXCEEDING DIFFICULTY THERE WERE SUCH PRESSING AND CROWDING THERE
IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER AND THIS WAS MORE PARTICULARLY SEEN IN WHITECHAPPEL THAT IS TO SAY THE BROAD STREET WHERE I LIVED INDEED NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT WAGGONS AND CARTS WITH GOODS
IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WRITTEN BY A CITIZEN WHO CONTINUED ALL THE WHILE IN LONDON NEVER MADE PUBLIC BEFORE
BECAUSE THOU HAST MADE THE LORD WHICH IS MY REFUGE EVEN THE MOST HIGH THY HABITATION THERE SHALL NO EVIL BEFALL THEE NEITHER SHALL ANY PLAGUE COME NIGH THY DWELLING
SAINT JAMES'S SIX BESIDES THIS IT WAS OBSERVED WITH GREAT UNEASINESS BY THE PEOPLE THAT THE WEEKLY BILLS IN GENERAL INCREASED VERY MUCH DURING THESE WEEKS ALTHOUGH IT WAS AT A TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN
TO PLACE TURNPIKES AND BARRIERS ON THE ROAD TO PREVENT PEOPLE TRAVELLING AND THAT THE TOWNS ON THE ROAD WOULD NOT SUFFER PEOPLE FROM LONDON TO PASS FOR FEAR OF BRINGING THE INFECTION ALONG WITH THEM
AND IN OTHER PLACES WHERE HE HAD BEEN FOR MY BROTHER BEING A MERCHANT WAS A FEW YEARS BEFORE AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED RETURNED FROM ABROAD COMING LAST FROM LISBON AND HOW
AND IT WAS PRINTED IN THE WEEKLY BILL OF MORTALITY IN THE USUAL MANNER THUS PLAGUE TWO PARISHES INFECTED ONE
TO GET PASSES AND CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH FOR SUCH AS TRAVELLED ABROAD FOR WITHOUT THESE THERE WAS NO BEING ADMITTED TO PASS THROUGH THE TOWNS UPON THE ROAD OR TO LODGE IN ANY INN
HOWEVER GREAT IT WAS MY FEARS PERHAPS AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE'S REPRESENTED TO BE MUCH GREATER THAN IT COULD BE
BUT WE PERCEIVED THE INFECTION KEPT CHIEFLY IN THE OUT PARISHES WHICH BEING VERY POPULOUS AND FULLER ALSO OF POOR THE DISTEMPER FOUND MORE TO PREY UPON THAN IN THE CITY
AND IN THE SUBURBS IN SOUTHWARK AND IN THE EAST PART SUCH AS WAPPING RATCLIFF STEPNEY ROTHERHITHE AND THE LIKE THE PEOPLE GENERALLY STAYED EXCEPT HERE AND THERE A FEW WEALTHY FAMILIES WHO AS ABOVE
IT WAS BROUGHT SOME SAID FROM ITALY OTHERS FROM THE LEVANT AMONG SOME GOODS WHICH WERE BROUGHT HOME BY THEIR TURKEY FLEET OTHERS SAID IT WAS BROUGHT FROM CANDIA OTHERS FROM CYPRUS
SAINT BRIDE'S SIX SAINT JAMES'S NINE
THERE WAS NONE OF THE PLAGUE AND BUT FOUR OF THE SPOTTED FEVER BUT THE FOLLOWING WEEK IT RETURNED AGAIN AND THE DISTEMPER WAS SPREAD INTO TWO OR THREE OTHER PARISHES
ABOUT THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS BEING FROM HEAVEN I MENTION THIS STORY ALSO AS THE BEST METHOD I CAN ADVISE ANY PERSON TO TAKE IN SUCH A CASE ESPECIALLY IF HE BE ONE THAT MAKES CONSCIENCE OF HIS DUTY
FROM THE BEGINNING OF APRIL ESPECIALLY THEY STOOD AT TWENTY FIVE EACH WEEK TILL THE WEEK FROM THE EIGHTEENTH TO THE TWENTY FIFTH
THEY WOULD GO UNCONCERNED INTO INFECTED PLACES AND CONVERSE WITH INFECTED PERSONS BY WHICH MEANS THEY DIED AT THE RATE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND A WEEK
I OBEYED THIS LAY CLOSE TO ME AND MY MIND SEEMED MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED TO STAY THAN EVER AND SUPPORTED WITH A SECRET SATISFACTION THAT I SHOULD BE KEPT ADD TO THIS THAT
YET THERE WAS FOURTEEN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER AS WELL AS FOURTEEN OF THE PLAGUE
WITHOUT ANY OVERSEER OR PERSON FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH THEM HAD BEEN TO HAZARD THE LOSS NOT ONLY OF MY TRADE BUT OF MY GOODS AND INDEED OF ALL I HAD IN THE WORLD I HAD AN ELDER BROTHER
THAT ANY SHOULD HAVE HEARTS SO HARDENED IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A CALAMITY AS TO ROB AND STEAL YET CERTAIN IT IS THAT ALL SORTS OF VILLAINIES AND EVEN LEVITIES AND DEBAUCHERIES
ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT AS IT HAD GOTTEN SOME VENT IN THE DISCOURSE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THE SECRETARIES OF STATE GOT KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND CONCERNING THEMSELVES TO INQUIRE ABOUT IT IN ORDER TO BE CERTAIN OF THE TRUTH
THE USUAL NUMBER OF BURIALS IN A WEEK IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES IN THE FIELDS AND SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN WERE FROM TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN OR NINETEEN EACH FEW MORE OR LESS
AND FROM THEM WAS HANDED ABOUT BY WORD OF MOUTH ONLY SO THAT THINGS DID NOT SPREAD INSTANTLY OVER THE WHOLE NATION AS THEY DO NOW BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD A TRUE ACCOUNT OF IT
THERE DIED BUT THREE OF WHICH NOT ONE WITHIN THE WHOLE CITY OR LIBERTIES AND SAINT ANDREW'S BURIED BUT FIFTEEN WHICH WAS VERY LOW
CONCERNING MY OWN CASE AND HOW I SHOULD DISPOSE OF MYSELF THAT IS TO SAY WHETHER I SHOULD RESOLVE TO STAY IN LONDON OR SHUT UP MY HOUSE AND FLEE AS MANY OF MY NEIGHBOURS DID I HAVE SET THIS PARTICULAR DOWN
ALL THE RUINED FAMILIES OF THE ROYAL PARTY FLOCKED HITHER ALL THE OLD SOLDIERS SET UP TRADES HERE AND ABUNDANCE OF FAMILIES SETTLED HERE AGAIN
AND HARDLY ANYTHING OF REFORMATION THOUGH THEY DID NOT WANT BEING TOLD THAT THEIR CRYING VICES MIGHT WITHOUT BREACH OF CHARITY BE SAID TO HAVE GONE FAR IN BRINGING THAT TERRIBLE JUDGEMENT UPON THE WHOLE NATION
AS THIS CONFLUX OF THE PEOPLE TO A YOUTHFUL AND GAY COURT MADE A GREAT TRADE IN THE CITY ESPECIALLY IN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO FASHION AND FINERY
I SAY AS MANY DID BECAUSE SEVERAL DID SO AT LAST ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE ARMIES IN THE WAR WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MANY YEARS PAST AND I MUST NEEDS SAY THAT SPEAKING OF SECOND CAUSES
AND OF THE LAST THE BILL ITSELF SAID
IRRESOLUTE AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I HAD SET THE EVENING WHOLLY APART TO CONSIDER SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT AND WAS ALL ALONE FOR ALREADY PEOPLE HAD AS IT WERE BY A GENERAL CONSENT
ONLY BECAUSE I COULD NOT HIRE A HORSE TO GO OR MY FELLOW WAS RUN AWAY THAT WAS TO ATTEND ME WAS RIDICULOUS SINCE AT THE TIME I HAD MY HEALTH AND LIMBS AND OTHER SERVANTS AND MIGHT
I TOLD HIM THAT I INCLINED TO STAY AND TAKE MY LOT IN THAT STATION IN WHICH GOD HAD PLACED ME AND THAT IT SEEMED TO BE MADE MORE ESPECIALLY MY DUTY ON THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT I HAVE SAID
IT WAS NOW MID JULY AND THE PLAGUE WHICH HAD CHIEFLY RAGED AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN AND AS I SAID BEFORE IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN
FOR IF ANY ONE COMPLAINED IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SAID HE HAD THE PLAGUE
BUT I HAD A FAMILY OF SERVANTS WHOM I KEPT AT MY BUSINESS HAD A HOUSE SHOP AND WAREHOUSES FILLED WITH GOODS AND IN SHORT TO LEAVE THEM ALL AS THINGS IN SUCH A CASE MUST BE LEFT THAT IS TO SAY
STILL CONTINUING VERY SEVERE EVEN TILL NEAR THE END OF FEBRUARY ATTENDED WITH SHARP THOUGH MODERATE WINDS THE BILLS DECREASED AGAIN AND THE CITY GREW HEALTHY AND EVERYBODY BEGAN TO LOOK UPON THE DANGER AS GOOD AS OVER
IN ONE WEEK SINCE THE PRECEDING VISITATION OF SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX HOWEVER ALL THIS WENT OFF AGAIN AND THE WEATHER PROVING COLD AND THE FROST WHICH BEGAN IN DECEMBER
HE WAS AS ABLE TO KEEP ME IN A TIME OF THE INFECTION AS IN A TIME OF HEALTH AND IF HE DID NOT THINK FIT TO DELIVER ME STILL I WAS IN HIS HANDS
WERE THEN PRACTISED IN THE TOWN AS OPENLY AS EVER I WILL NOT SAY QUITE AS FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE MANY WAYS LESSENED BUT THE CITY ITSELF BEGAN NOW TO BE VISITED TOO
AS I WAS THAT I OUGHT INDEED TO SUBMIT TO IT AS A WORK OF HEAVEN IF I HAD BEEN ANY WAY DISABLED BY DISTEMPERS OR DISEASES AND THAT THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO GO
AS ANYONE MIGHT PERCEIVE BY THEIR APPEARANCE THIS WAS A VERY TERRIBLE AND MELANCHOLY THING TO SEE AND AS IT WAS A SIGHT WHICH I COULD NOT BUT LOOK ON FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
THAT THE BEST PREPARATION FOR THE PLAGUE WAS TO RUN AWAY FROM IT AS TO MY ARGUMENT OF LOSING MY TRADE MY GOODS OR DEBTS HE QUITE CONFUTED ME HE TOLD ME THE SAME THING WHICH
THIS HURRY I SAY CONTINUED SOME WEEKS THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE MONTH OF MAY AND JUNE AND THE MORE BECAUSE IT WAS RUMOURED THAT AN ORDER OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO BE ISSUED OUT
IN THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WENT TO OXFORD WHERE IT PLEASED GOD TO PRESERVE THEM AND THE DISTEMPER DID NOT AS I HEARD OF SO MUCH AS TOUCH THEM FOR WHICH I CANNOT SAY THAT
AS OTHERS RETIRED REALLY FRIGHTED WITH THE DISTEMPER IT WAS A MERE DESOLATING OF SOME OF THE STREETS BUT THE FRIGHT WAS NOT YET NEAR SO GREAT IN THE CITY ABSTRACTLY SO CALLED
AND AFTERWARDS FETCHED A ROUND FARTHER INTO BUCKINGHAMSHIRE OR BEDFORDSHIRE TO A RETREAT HE HAD FOUND OUT THERE FOR HIS FAMILY IT WAS A VERY ILL TIME TO BE SICK IN
IT WAS ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT I AMONG THE REST OF MY NEIGHBOURS HEARD IN ORDINARY DISCOURSE THAT THE PLAGUE WAS RETURNED AGAIN IN HOLLAND
WHEREAS THE EUROPEANS OR CHRISTIAN MERCHANTS WHO KEPT THEMSELVES RETIRED AND RESERVED GENERALLY ESCAPED THE CONTAGION UPON THESE ARGUMENTS MY BROTHER CHANGED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN
BECAUSE AS I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD NOT MINGLE WITH ANYBODY THAT CAME OUT OF HOUSES OR
MY TRADE WAS A SADDLER AND AS MY DEALINGS WERE CHIEFLY NOT BY A SHOP OR CHANCE TRADE BUT AMONG THE MERCHANTS TRADING TO THE ENGLISH COLONIES IN AMERICA SO MY EFFECTS LAY VERY MUCH IN THE HANDS OF SUCH
UPON THE WHOLE THAT THERE WERE FIFTY DIED THAT WEEK OF THE PLAGUE THE NEXT BILL WAS FROM THE TWENTY THIRD OF MAY TO THE THIRTIETH WHEN THE NUMBER OF THE PLAGUE WAS SEVENTEEN BUT
AND AS I HAD ALREADY PREPARED EVERYTHING AS WELL AS I COULD AS TO MY BUSINESS AND WHOM TO ENTRUST MY AFFAIRS WITH I HAD LITTLE TO DO BUT TO RESOLVE I WENT HOME THAT EVENING GREATLY OPPRESSED IN MY MIND
WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLE AND IN WHICH WAS EMBARKED ALL MY EFFECTS IN THE WORLD AND THE OTHER WAS THE PRESERVATION OF MY LIFE IN SO DISMAL A CALAMITY AS I SAW APPARENTLY WAS COMING UPON THE WHOLE CITY AND WHICH
A FRIGHTFUL NUMBER OF WHOM THEY SET DOWN BUT NINE OF THE PLAGUE BUT ON AN EXAMINATION MORE STRICTLY BY THE JUSTICES OF PEACE AND AT THE LORD MAYOR'S REQUEST
WERE RETURNING OR SENT FROM THE COUNTRIES TO FETCH MORE PEOPLE BESIDES INNUMERABLE NUMBERS OF MEN ON HORSEBACK SOME ALONE OTHERS WITH SERVANTS AND GENERALLY SPEAKING
AND IT BEGAN TO THICKEN IN CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ESPECIALLY AND IN CLARKENWELL SO THAT BY THE SECOND WEEK IN AUGUST CRIPPLEGATE PARISH ALONE BURIED EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX AND CLARKENWELL
IN HIM WILL I TRUST SURELY HE SHALL DELIVER THEE FROM THE SNARE OF THE FOWLER AND FROM THE NOISOME PESTILENCE HE SHALL COVER THEE WITH HIS FEATHERS AND UNDER HIS WINGS SHALT THOU TRUST
FROM THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE OF MY CALLING AND THE CARE DUE FROM ME FOR THE PRESERVATION OF MY EFFECTS WHICH WERE AS I MIGHT SAY MY ESTATE ALSO THE INTIMATIONS WHICH I THOUGHT
OR RATHER AT THE UPPER END OF DRURY LANE
NOW AS THERE HAD NONE DIED IN THE CITY FOR ALL THIS TIME MY LORD MAYOR GAVE CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY TO ALL THOSE WHO LIVED IN THE NINETY SEVEN PARISHES AND TO THOSE WITHIN THE LIBERTIES TOO
TO LONDON I OFTEN THOUGHT THAT AS JERUSALEM WAS BESIEGED BY THE ROMANS WHEN THE JEWS WERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE THE PASSOVER BY WHICH MEANS AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED THERE
AND HAVING THE KEY IN MY POCKET I USED TO GO INTO THE HOUSE AND OVER MOST OF THE ROOMS TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WELL FOR THOUGH IT BE SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO TELL
IT BEGAN TO BE SUSPECTED THAT THE PLAGUE WAS AMONG THE PEOPLE AT THAT END OF THE TOWN AND THAT MANY HAD DIED OF IT THOUGH THEY HAD TAKEN CARE TO KEEP IT AS MUCH FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE
OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTINUED VERY EASY BUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN THEIR CONSTERNATION WAS VERY GREAT AND THE RICHER SORT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY FROM THE WEST PART OF THE CITY
FLYING FROM GOD AND THAT HE COULD CAUSE HIS JUSTICE TO OVERTAKE ME WHEN AND WHERE HE THOUGHT FIT THESE THOUGHTS QUITE TURNED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN AND WHEN I CAME TO DISCOURSE WITH MY BROTHER AGAIN
AND WOULD BE DIRECTED WHAT TO DO IN IT NAMELY THAT HE SHOULD KEEP HIS EYE UPON THE PARTICULAR PROVIDENCES WHICH OCCUR AT THAT TIME AND LOOK UPON THEM COMPLEXLY AS THEY REGARD ONE ANOTHER
AMONG THE WEALTHIEST OF THE PEOPLE AND SUCH PEOPLE AS WERE UNENCUMBERED WITH TRADES AND BUSINESS BUT OF THE REST THE GENERALITY STAYED AND SEEMED TO ABIDE THE WORST SO THAT
HAD MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT TRAVELLED DONE SO THE PLAGUE HAD NOT BEEN CARRIED INTO SO MANY COUNTRY TOWNS AND HOUSES AS IT WAS TO THE GREAT DAMAGE AND INDEED TO THE RUIN OF ABUNDANCE OF PEOPLE
SAINT BRIDE'S ZERO SAINT JAMES'S EIGHT
NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS ALREADY INFECTED THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF MAY YET THE WEATHER WAS TEMPERATE VARIABLE AND COOL ENOUGH AND PEOPLE HAD STILL SOME HOPES THAT WHICH ENCOURAGED THEM WAS THAT THE CITY WAS HEALTHY
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE I AM SURE BUT THE SIGHT OF ANOTHER MAN ASLEEP IN BED WHEN I AM UP MADDENS ME IT SEEMS TO ME SO SHOCKING TO SEE THE PRECIOUS HOURS OF A MAN'S LIFE THE PRICELESS MOMENTS THAT WILL NEVER COME BACK TO HIM AGAIN
IT WAS PROMPTLY CONCLUDED BY OUR STREET THAT BIGGS'S BOY FOR THAT PERIOD WAS AT THE BOTTOM OF IT AND HAD HE NOT BEEN ABLE
NOCTURNAL SCENE NODDING APPROVAL NOISELESS REVERIE NOISY PLATITUDES NOMADIC LIFE
BUT ON CATCHING SIGHT OF HARRIS AND ME AND MONTMORENCY AND THE THINGS HE EASED UP AND STARED HARRIS AND I FROWNED AT HIM THIS MIGHT HAVE WOUNDED A MORE SENSITIVE NATURE
SHORT NOTICE SOON PAST THE FINE WEATHER NEVER CAME THAT SUMMER I EXPECT THAT MACHINE MUST HAVE BEEN REFERRING TO THE FOLLOWING SPRING THEN THERE ARE THOSE NEW STYLE OF BAROMETERS
WE TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT SHAVING THAT MORNING AS WE WEREN'T GOING TO UNPACK THAT BAG AGAIN FOR HIM NOR FOR ANYONE LIKE HIM HE SAID DON'T BE ABSURD HOW CAN I GO INTO THE CITY LIKE THIS
WHEN HE CALLED THERE FOR ORDERS THE MORNING AFTER THE CRIME ASSISTED BY NO TWENTY ONE WHO HAPPENED TO BE ON THE STEP AT THE TIME TO PROVE A COMPLETE ALIBI IT WOULD HAVE GONE HARD WITH HIM I DIDN'T KNOW BIGGS'S BOY AT THAT TIME BUT
AND COULD PAY FOR THE BOAT HE HAD BORROWED TO COME TO AFRICA IN BUT HE ANSWERED NO YOU KNOW HOW SHY I AM I HATE BEING STARED AT AND HE ALMOST BEGAN TO CRY
NOW THE FACT WAS THAT HE HARDLY EVER DID EXERCISE ME AND WHEN THE MASTER WAS BUSY I OFTEN STOOD FOR DAYS TOGETHER WITHOUT STRETCHING MY LEGS AT ALL AND YET BEING FED JUST AS HIGH AS IF I WERE AT HARD WORK
SO SHE WENT ON TILL AFTER HE WAS BURIED AND THEN AS SHE HAD NO HOME OR RELATIONS
I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT NIGHT WALK IT WAS MORE THAN THREE MILES ROBERT LED ME ON VERY SLOWLY
WITH GREAT PAIN I AM SURE HE WAS SORRY FOR ME FOR HE OFTEN PATTED AND ENCOURAGED ME TALKING TO ME IN A PLEASANT VOICE AT LAST I REACHED MY OWN BOX AND HAD SOME CORN
THIS OFTEN DISORDERED MY HEALTH AND MADE ME SOMETIMES HEAVY AND DULL BUT MORE OFTEN RESTLESS AND FEVERISH HE NEVER EVEN GAVE ME A MEAL OF GREEN FOOD OR A BRAN MASH WHICH WOULD HAVE COOLED ME
LOOK HERE HIS HOOF IS CUT ALL TO PIECES HE MIGHT WELL COME DOWN POOR FELLOW I TELL YOU WHAT NED I'M AFRAID IT HASN'T BEEN ALL RIGHT WITH REUBEN JUST THINK OF HIS RIDING A HORSE OVER THESE STONES WITHOUT A SHOE
AND STOOPED DOWN OVER IT IT IS REUBEN HE SAID AND HE DOES NOT STIR THE OTHER MAN FOLLOWED AND BENT OVER HIM HE'S DEAD HE SAID
FOR HE WAS ALTOGETHER AS IGNORANT AS HE WAS CONCEITED AND THEN INSTEAD OF EXERCISE OR CHANGE OF FOOD I HAD TO TAKE HORSE BALLS AND DRAUGHTS WHICH BESIDE THE NUISANCE OF HAVING THEM POURED DOWN MY THROAT
BOOTS SAID IT WAS EVIDENT THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A PROLONGED SPELL OF GRAND WEATHER SOME TIME AND READ OUT A POEM WHICH WAS PRINTED OVER THE TOP OF THE ORACLE ABOUT LONG FORETOLD LONG LAST
OR GROOMING ME THOROUGHLY HE THOUGHT NO MORE OF THAT THAN IF I HAD BEEN A COW HE LEFT MY BIT RUSTY MY SADDLE DAMP AND MY CRUPPER STIFF ALFRED SMIRK
AND SELECTING A STRAW TO CHEW FIXED US WITH HIS EYE HE EVIDENTLY MEANT TO SEE THIS THING OUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE GROCER'S BOY PASSED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET BIGGS'S BOY HAILED HIM
BUT BIGGS'S BOYS ARE NOT AS A RULE TOUCHY HE CAME TO A DEAD STOP A YARD FROM OUR STEP
HE SNEAKED THE CIGARETTE THAT I HAD CAREFULLY ROLLED UP FOR MYSELF AND WENT THEN HARRIS AND I HAVING FINISHED UP THE FEW THINGS LEFT ON THE TABLE
OVERFLOWING SYMPATHY OVERHANGING DARKNESS OVERMASTERING POTENCY OVERPOWERING ARGUMENT
WE WENT UPSTAIRS AND ASKED THE TRAFFIC SUPERINTENDENT AND HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD JUST MET A MAN WHO SAID HE HAD SEEN IT AT NUMBER THREE PLATFORM WE WENT TO NUMBER THREE PLATFORM
AND AFTER THEY HAD GONE A GOOD MANY MILES ONE OF THEM FOUND PECULIAR FOOTPRINTS NEAR THE EDGE OF A RIVER AND THEY KNEW THAT A PUSHMI PULLYU MUST BE VERY NEAR THAT SPOT THEN
BEING WASTED IN MERE BRUTISH SLEEP THERE WAS GEORGE THROWING AWAY IN HIDEOUS SLOTH THE INESTIMABLE GIFT OF TIME HIS VALUABLE LIFE EVERY SECOND OF WHICH HE WOULD HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR HEREAFTER PASSING AWAY FROM HIM
NICE DISCRIMINATION NIGGARDLY ALLOWANCE NIGHTMARE FANTASY NIMBLE FACULTY NOBLE CONDESCENSION
WELL SIR HE SAID TOUCHING HIS CAP I'LL DO SO IF YOU PLEASE SIR BUT IT IS RATHER DANGEROUS SIR THROWING DOWN WATER IN A HORSE'S BOX THEY ARE VERY APT TO TAKE COLD SIR I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO HIM AN INJURY
FOR SURELY HE IS THE GREATEST OF MEN AND THE GRAND GORILLA WHO HAD THE STRENGTH OF SEVEN HORSES IN HIS HAIRY ARMS ROLLED A GREAT ROCK UP TO THE HEAD OF THE TABLE AND SAID THIS STONE
HOW IT ENDED IT MUST HAVE BEEN NEARLY MIDNIGHT WHEN I HEARD AT A GREAT DISTANCE THE SOUND OF A HORSE'S FEET SOMETIMES THE SOUND DIED AWAY THEN IT GREW CLEARER AGAIN
WHAT'S ELY GOT TO DO WITH IT AND IF YOU TAP IT
HE DID HIS BEST FOR THE MAN THAT PROPHESIES US BAD WEATHER ON THE CONTRARY WE ENTERTAIN ONLY BITTER AND REVENGEFUL THOUGHTS GOING TO CLEAR UP D'YE THINK WE SHOUT CHEERILY AS WE PASS
WHEN THE PACKING WAS FINISHED AND EVERYTHING WAS READY TO START THE MONKEYS GAVE A GRAND PARTY FOR THE DOCTOR AND ALL THE ANIMALS OF THE JUNGLE CAME AND THEY HAD PINEAPPLES AND MANGOES AND HONEY
WITHOUT BREAKING ITSELF IT EVIDENTLY WANTED TO GO ON AND PROGNOSTICATE DROUGHT AND WATER FAMINE AND SUNSTROKE AND SIMOOMS AND SUCH THINGS BUT THE PEG PREVENTED IT
BUT A HEAD AT EACH END AND SHARP HORNS ON EACH HEAD THEY WERE VERY SHY AND TERRIBLY HARD TO CATCH THE BLACK MEN GET MOST OF THEIR ANIMALS BY SNEAKING UP BEHIND THEM WHILE THEY ARE NOT LOOKING
SAID THE MAN RIGHT IT IS WE ANSWERED AND WITH HARRIS AT THE SCULLS AND I AT THE TILLER LINES AND MONTMORENCY UNHAPPY AND DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS IN THE PROW
AND WHEN AT LAST IT WAS HEALED THEY PUT A BLISTERING FLUID OVER THE FRONT OF BOTH KNEES TO BRING ALL THE HAIR OFF THEY HAD SOME REASON FOR THIS AND I SUPPOSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AS SMITH'S DEATH HAD BEEN SO SUDDEN
THIS DOCTOR SAID CHEE CHEE IS THE PUSHMI PULLYU THE RAREST ANIMAL OF THE AFRICAN JUNGLES THE ONLY TWO HEADED BEAST IN THE WORLD TAKE HIM HOME WITH YOU
BUT SHE KNEW AS WELL AS I DID WHAT WAS GOING ON AND STOOD AS STILL AS A STONE I NOTICED THAT BECAUSE IF SHE HAD A FAULT IT WAS THAT SHE WAS IMPATIENT IN STANDING
TAKE THE FUNNY LOOKING THING ALONG DO WELL PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY MURMURED THE DOCTOR IT CERTAINLY WOULD MAKE A NICE NEW KIND OF PET BUT DOES THE ER
AS THE BEEF COULD WAIT GEORGE GOT HOLD OF THE PAPER AND READ US OUT THE BOATING FATALITIES
WHAT HE SHRIEKED JUMPING OUT OF BED INTO THE BATH WHO THE THUNDER PUT THIS THING HERE WE TOLD HIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN A FOOL NOT TO SEE THE BATH WE FINISHED DRESSING
REALLY WANT TO GO ABROAD YES I'LL GO SAID THE PUSHMI PULLYU WHO SAW AT ONCE FROM THE DOCTOR'S FACE THAT HE WAS A MAN TO BE TRUSTED YOU HAVE BEEN SO KIND TO THE ANIMALS HERE
AND NOBODY KNEW WHAT HAD BECOME OF IT OUR BOAT WAS WAITING FOR US AT KINGSTON JUST BELOW BRIDGE AND TO IT WE WENDED OUR WAY AND ROUND IT WE STORED OUR LUGGAGE AND INTO IT WE STEPPED ARE YOU ALL RIGHT SIR
TOUCHING HIS HAT AT EVERY WORD
A HUMBUG MY MASTER WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY SUITED BUT IN A FEW DAYS
WELL NO SIR I'M AFRAID IT'S SETTLED DOWN FOR THE DAY HE REPLIES SHAKING HIS HEAD STUPID OLD FOOL WE MUTTER WHAT'S HE KNOW ABOUT IT AND IF HIS PORTENT PROVES CORRECT
AND AFTER ROBERT HAD WRAPPED UP MY KNEES IN WET CLOTHS HE TIED UP MY FOOT IN A BRAN POULTICE TO DRAW OUT THE HEAT AND CLEANSE IT BEFORE THE HORSE DOCTOR SAW IT IN THE MORNING AND I MANAGED TO GET MYSELF DOWN ON THE STRAW
WITH GENERAL DEPRESSION OVER THE MIDLAND COUNTIES LONDON AND CHANNEL BAR FALLING I DO THINK THAT OF ALL THE SILLY IRRITATING TOMFOOLISHNESS BY WHICH WE ARE PLAGUED THIS WEATHER FORECAST FRAUD
THEY ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD GO WITH DOCTOR DOLITTLE AND BE PUT ON SHOW IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN BUT HE SHOOK BOTH HIS HEADS HARD AND SAID CERTAINLY NOT
NOTORIOUSLY PROFLIGATE NOVEL
AND HARRIS AND I BEGAN TO FEEL RATHER ASHAMED OF IT THOUGH WHY WE SHOULD BE I CAN'T SEE NO CAB CAME BY BUT THE STREET BOYS DID AND GOT INTERESTED IN THE SHOW APPARENTLY AND STOPPED
AND TO HIRE WHEN HE WANTED ONE I WAS THEREFORE KEPT TILL MY FEET WERE QUITE SOUND
NERVELESS HAND NERVOUS SOLICITUDE NETTLED OPPONENT NEUTRAL EYE NEW PERPLEXITIES
CONSIDERED HIMSELF VERY HANDSOME HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ABOUT HIS HAIR WHISKERS AND NECKTIE BEFORE A LITTLE LOOKING GLASS IN THE HARNESS ROOM WHEN HIS MASTER WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IT WAS ALWAYS YES SIR
WHEN THE DOCTOR STOPPED SPEAKING AND SAT DOWN ALL THE MONKEYS CLAPPED THEIR HANDS A LONG TIME AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER LET IT BE REMEMBERED ALWAYS AMONG OUR PEOPLE THAT HE SAT AND ATE WITH US HERE UNDER THE TREES
BUT FOR ALL THAT SHE BEGGED ME TO GO AND MEET HIM BUT WHAT MUST WE DO THERE'S THE HORSE TO GET HOME AS WELL AS THE BODY AND THAT WILL BE NO EASY MATTER
HARRIS AND I APPEARED TO BE STRUCK BY IT AT THE SAME INSTANT WE DETERMINED TO SAVE HIM AND IN THIS NOBLE RESOLVE OUR OWN DISPUTE WAS FORGOTTEN WE FLEW ACROSS AND SLUNG THE CLOTHES OFF HIM
OMINOUS RUMORS OMNIPOTENT DECREE OMNISCIENT AFFIRMATION ONCOMING HORDE
NOMINAL ALLEGIANCE NONCHALANT MANNER NON COMMITTAL WAY NONDESCRIPT GARB NONSENSE RHYMES
THERE WAS THE GLADSTONE AND THE SMALL HAND BAG AND THE TWO HAMPERS AND A LARGE ROLL OF RUGS AND SOME FOUR OR FIVE OVERCOATS AND MACINTOSHES AND A FEW UMBRELLAS
NINE O WHAT I CRIED STARTING UP NINE O'CLOCK SHE REPLIED THROUGH THE KEYHOLE I THOUGHT YOU WAS A OVERSLEEPING YOURSELVES I WOKE HARRIS AND TOLD HIM HE SAID
OSTENTATIOUS DISPLAY OUTLANDISH FASHION OUTRAGEOUSLY VEHEMENT OUTSPOKEN ENCOURAGEMENT OUTSTANDING FEATURE
THE LONG STRAIGHT ONES I NEVER CAN MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF THOSE THERE IS ONE SIDE FOR TEN A M YESTERDAY AND ONE SIDE FOR TEN A M TO DAY BUT YOU CAN'T ALWAYS GET THERE AS EARLY AS TEN YOU KNOW
EXCUSE ME SURELY YOU ARE RELATED TO THE DEER FAMILY ARE YOU NOT YES
THE GROCER'S BOY CAME ACROSS AND TOOK UP A POSITION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STEP THEN THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN FROM THE BOOT SHOP STOPPED AND JOINED BIGGS'S BOY WHILE THE EMPTY CAN SUPERINTENDENT FROM THE BLUE POSTS
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO GET UP AT SIX SO I DID I ANSWERED
AND IT JUMPED UP AND POINTED TO VERY DRY THE BOOTS STOPPED AS HE WAS PASSING AND SAID HE EXPECTED IT MEANT TO MORROW I FANCIED THAT MAYBE IT WAS THINKING OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST BUT BOOTS SAID NO HE THOUGHT NOT
IT WAS MISSUS POPPETS THAT WOKE ME UP NEXT MORNING SHE SAID
THE FARRIER ORDERED ALL THE LITTER TO BE TAKEN OUT OF MY BOX DAY BY DAY AND THE FLOOR KEPT VERY CLEAN THEN I WAS TO HAVE BRAN MASHES A LITTLE GREEN FOOD AND NOT SO MUCH CORN
I'M AFRAID IT HAS BEEN THE OLD THING OVER AGAIN POOR SUSAN SHE LOOKED AWFULLY PALE WHEN SHE CAME TO MY HOUSE TO ASK IF HE HAD NOT COME HOME SHE MADE BELIEVE SHE WAS NOT A BIT ANXIOUS
WE COME BACK FEELING STILL MORE ANGRY AGAINST HIM AND WITH A VAGUE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE HAS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT IT WAS TOO BRIGHT AND SUNNY ON THIS ESPECIAL MORNING FOR GEORGE'S BLOOD CURDLING READINGS ABOUT
AND WE CHUCKLED TO THINK HOW WET THEY WERE GOING TO GET AND CAME BACK AND STIRRED THE FIRE AND GOT OUR BOOKS AND ARRANGED OUR SPECIMENS OF SEAWEED AND COCKLE SHELLS BY TWELVE O'CLOCK WITH THE SUN POURING INTO THE ROOM THE HEAT BECAME QUITE OPPRESSIVE
HE ALWAYS BRUSHED MY MANE AND TAIL WITH WATER AND MY HOOFS WITH OIL BEFORE HE BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR TO MAKE ME LOOK SMART
THERE WAS ONE HANGING UP IN A HOTEL AT OXFORD AT WHICH I WAS STAYING LAST SPRING AND WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS POINTING TO SET FAIR IT WAS SIMPLY POURING WITH RAIN OUTSIDE AND HAD BEEN ALL DAY AND I COULDN'T QUITE MAKE MATTERS OUT
HE SAID HE WOULD COME WITH THEM AND SEE WHAT KIND OF A MAN THE DOCTOR WAS FIRST SO THE MONKEYS TRAVELED BACK WITH THE PUSHMI PULLYU AND WHEN THEY CAME TO WHERE THE DOCTOR'S LITTLE HOUSE OF GRASS WAS THEY KNOCKED ON THE DOOR THE DUCK
NOONDAY SPLENDOR NORMAL CHARACTERISTICS NOTABLE CIRCUMSTANCE NOTEWORTHY FRIENDSHIP NOTICEABLY BEGRIMED
IT WILL BREAK ALL RIGHT ENOUGH SIR AH
OH DO BE SENSIBLE CRIED DAB DAB WHERE WOULD YOU GET ALL THE WOOD AND THE NAILS TO MAKE ONE WITH AND BESIDES WHAT ARE WE GOING TO LIVE ON WE SHALL BE POORER THAN EVER WHEN WE GET BACK CHEE CHEE'S PERFECTLY RIGHT
UNUSED HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN UP STUFFING HIMSELF WITH EGGS AND BACON IRRITATING THE DOG OR FLIRTING WITH THE SLAVEY INSTEAD OF SPRAWLING THERE SUNK IN SOUL CLOGGING OBLIVION IT WAS A TERRIBLE THOUGHT
THEY SOON SAW MY CUT KNEES WHY THE HORSE HAS BEEN DOWN AND THROWN HIM
BUT YOU COULD NOT DO THIS WITH THE PUSHMI PULLYU BECAUSE NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU CAME TOWARDS HIM HE WAS ALWAYS FACING YOU AND BESIDES ONLY ONE HALF OF HIM SLEPT AT A TIME THE OTHER HEAD WAS ALWAYS AWAKE
WHILE THE STRONG VAPORS THAT ROSE MADE MY EYES SMART AND INFLAME AND I DID NOT FEEL THE SAME APPETITE FOR MY FOOD ONE DAY HIS MASTER CAME IN AND SAID ALFRED THE STABLE SMELLS RATHER STRONG
FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF THEM SINCE I SHOULD NOT HAVE ATTACHED MUCH IMPORTANCE TO THAT ALIBI MYSELF BIGGS'S BOY AS I HAVE SAID CAME ROUND THE CORNER HE WAS EVIDENTLY IN A GREAT HURRY WHEN HE FIRST DAWNED UPON THE VISION
AND ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT AND DRINK AFTER THEY HAD ALL FINISHED EATING THE DOCTOR GOT UP AND SAID MY FRIENDS I AM NOT CLEVER AT SPEAKING LONG WORDS AFTER DINNER LIKE SOME MEN
BY OUR PAYING ATTENTION TO THE WEATHER REPORT OF THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER HEAVY SHOWERS WITH THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE EXPECTED TO DAY IT WOULD SAY ON MONDAY AND SO WE WOULD GIVE UP OUR PICNIC AND STOP INDOORS ALL DAY WAITING FOR THE RAIN
ORGANIC ASSIMILATION ORIENTAL SPICERY ORIGINALLY PROMULGATED OSCILLATORY MOVEMENT OSTENSIBLE OCCUPATION
AND SAYS OH NO SIR
FEEL HOW COLD HIS HANDS ARE THEY RAISED HIM UP BUT THERE WAS NO LIFE AND HIS HAIR WAS SOAKED WITH BLOOD THEY LAID HIM DOWN AGAIN AND CAME AND LOOKED AT ME
CAN'T THE OTHER HEAD TALK AS WELL OH YES SAID THE PUSHMI PULLYU BUT I KEEP THE OTHER MOUTH FOR EATING MOSTLY IN THAT WAY I CAN TALK WHILE I AM EATING WITHOUT BEING RUDE OUR PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY POLITE
AND HE TOOK A BOOK OUT OF THE TRUNK WHICH DAB DAB WAS PACKING AND BEGAN TURNING THE PAGES LET US SEE IF BUFFON SAYS ANYTHING
N NAIVE MANNER NAKED EYE NAMELESS FEAR NARCOTIC EFFECT NARROWING AXIOMS
TOOK UP AN INDEPENDENT POSITION ON THE CURB THEY AIN'T A GOING TO STARVE ARE THEY SAID THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE BOOT SHOP AH YOU'D WANT TO TAKE A THING OR TWO WITH YOU RETORTED THE BLUE POSTS
BUT I'LL DO IT IF YOU PLEASE SIR WELL SAID HIS MASTER I SHOULD NOT LIKE HIM TO TAKE COLD BUT I DON'T LIKE THE SMELL OF THIS STABLE DO YOU THINK THE DRAINS ARE ALL RIGHT WELL SIR NOW YOU MENTION IT
THE TENTH CHAPTER THE RAREST ANIMAL OF ALL PUSHMI PULLYUS ARE NOW EXTINCT THAT MEANS THERE AREN'T ANY MORE
NOBODY AT WATERLOO EVER DOES KNOW WHERE A TRAIN IS GOING TO START FROM OR WHERE A TRAIN WHEN IT DOES START IS GOING TO OR ANYTHING ABOUT IT THE PORTER WHO TOOK OUR THINGS THOUGHT IT WOULD GO FROM NUMBER TWO PLATFORM
I TAPPED IT AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING AND IT WENT UP STILL HIGHER AND THE RAIN CAME DOWN FASTER THAN EVER ON WEDNESDAY I WENT AND HIT IT AGAIN AND THE POINTER WENT ROUND TOWARDS SET FAIR VERY DRY AND
TILL MY FEET WERE WELL AGAIN WITH THIS TREATMENT I SOON REGAINED MY SPIRITS BUT MISTER BARRY WAS SO MUCH DISGUSTED AT BEING TWICE DECEIVED BY HIS GROOMS THAT HE DETERMINED TO GIVE UP KEEPING A HORSE
TO THE ABYSSINIAN GAZELLES AND THE ASIATIC CHAMOIS ON MY MOTHER'S SIDE MY FATHER'S GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS THE LAST OF THE UNICORNS MOST INTERESTING MURMURED THE DOCTOR
I WILL ATTEND TO THE HOOF AND I WILL DIRECT YOUR MAN HOW TO APPLY THE LINIMENT WHICH I WILL GIVE HIM THE NEXT DAY I HAD MY FEET THOROUGHLY CLEANSED AND STUFFED WITH TOW SOAKED IN SOME STRONG LOTION
THEY EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SHUT UP IN A MENAGERIE BUT WOULD JUST BE LOOKED AT THEY TOLD HIM THAT THE DOCTOR WAS A VERY KIND MAN BUT HADN'T ANY MONEY AND PEOPLE WOULD PAY TO SEE A TWO HEADED ANIMAL AND THE DOCTOR WOULD GET RICH
IT WOULD COMMENCE TO RAIN HARD AND A BITTERLY COLD WIND WOULD SPRING UP AND BOTH WOULD KEEP ON STEADILY FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND WE WOULD COME HOME WITH COLDS AND RHEUMATISM ALL OVER US AND GO TO BED
AND YOUR FORTUNE'S MADE PEOPLE WILL PAY ANY MONEY TO SEE HIM BUT I DON'T WANT ANY MONEY SAID THE DOCTOR YES YOU DO SAID DAB DAB THE DUCK
I THINK THE DRAIN DOES SOMETIMES SEND BACK A SMELL THERE MAY BE SOMETHING WRONG SIR
OR ELSE THE WINDSOR LOOP BUT THEY WERE SURE IT WASN'T THE KINGSTON TRAIN THOUGH WHY THEY WERE SURE IT WASN'T THEY COULDN'T SAY THEN OUR PORTER SAID HE THOUGHT THAT MUST BE IT ON THE HIGH LEVEL PLATFORM SAID HE THOUGHT HE KNEW THE TRAIN
AND PACKING OURSELVES AND OUR BELONGINGS INTO IT AND SHOOTING OUT A COUPLE OF MONTMORENCY'S FRIENDS WHO HAD EVIDENTLY SWORN NEVER TO FORSAKE HIM WE DROVE AWAY AMIDST THE CHEERS OF THE CROWD BIGGS'S BOY SHYING A CARROT AFTER US FOR LUCK
AND I HAVE JUST EATEN MANY FRUITS AND MUCH HONEY BUT I WISH TO TELL YOU THAT I AM VERY SAD AT LEAVING YOUR BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY BECAUSE I HAVE THINGS TO DO IN THE LAND OF THE WHITE MEN I MUST GO
HIS FEET ARE VERY TENDER IT IS FORTUNATE THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN DOWN I WONDER YOUR GROOM HAS NOT SEEN TO IT BEFORE THIS IS THE SORT OF THING WE FIND IN FOUL STABLES WHERE THE LITTER IS NEVER PROPERLY CLEANED OUT IF YOU WILL SEND HIM HERE TO MORROW
AND THAT I WAS PROBABLY THE CORPSE'S BROTHER AT LAST AN EMPTY CAB TURNED UP IT IS A STREET WHERE AS A RULE AND WHEN THEY ARE NOT WANTED EMPTY CABS PASS AT THE RATE OF THREE A MINUTE AND HANG ABOUT AND GET IN YOUR WAY
AND HARRIS LANDED HIM ONE WITH A SLIPPER AND I SHOUTED IN HIS EAR AND HE AWOKE WASERMARRER HE OBSERVED SITTING UP GET UP YOU FAT HEADED CHUNK ROARED HARRIS
IS ABOUT THE MOST AGGRAVATING IT FORECASTS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE AND PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO DAY I REMEMBER A HOLIDAY OF MINE BEING COMPLETELY RUINED ONE LATE AUTUMN
AND PEOPLE WOULD PASS THE HOUSE GOING OFF IN WAGONETTES AND COACHES AS JOLLY AND MERRY AS COULD BE THE SUN SHINING OUT AND NOT A CLOUD TO BE SEEN AH WE SAID AS WE STOOD LOOKING OUT AT THEM THROUGH THE WINDOW WON'T THEY COME HOME SOAKED
LORD SAVE US CRIED THE DUCK HOW DOES IT MAKE UP ITS MIND IT DOESN'T LOOK TO ME AS THOUGH IT HAD ANY SAID JIP THE DOG
THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS STARTED OUT TO GO BACK TO THE SEASHORE
BUT I SHOULD NEVER LOSE THE BLEMISH I BELIEVE THEY DID THE BEST TO MAKE A GOOD CURE BUT IT WAS A LONG AND PAINFUL ONE PROUD FLESH AS THEY CALLED IT CAME UP IN MY KNEES AND WAS BURNED OUT WITH CAUSTIC
OR THE TEN A M EXPRESS FOR THE ISLE OF WIGHT OR SOMEWHERE IN THAT DIRECTION AND WE SHOULD ALL KNOW WHEN WE GOT THERE WE SLIPPED HALF A CROWN INTO HIS HAND
WE KNOW THAT IT IS BIGGS'S LATEST
WITHOUT OUR HAVING THE MISERY OF KNOWING ABOUT IT BEFOREHAND THE PROPHET WE LIKE IS THE OLD MAN WHO ON THE PARTICULARLY GLOOMY LOOKING MORNING OF SOME DAY WHEN WE PARTICULARLY WANT IT TO BE FINE LOOKS ROUND THE HORIZON WITH A PARTICULARLY KNOWING EYE
SAID HIS MASTER YES SIR I WILL THE BRICKLAYER CAME AND PULLED UP A GREAT MANY BRICKS BUT FOUND NOTHING AMISS SO HE PUT DOWN SOME LIME AND CHARGED THE MASTER FIVE SHILLINGS
I BELIEVED IN HER INNOCENCE I KNEW IT COULD THE DEMON WHO HAD
SHE THEN RELATED THAT BY THE PERMISSION OF ELIZABETH SHE HAD PASSED THE EVENING OF THE NIGHT ON WHICH THE MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED AT THE HOUSE OF AN AUNT AT CHENE
HE NOW SLEEPS WITH HIS ANGEL MOTHER WHO THAT HAD SEEN HIM BRIGHT AND JOYOUS IN HIS YOUNG BEAUTY BUT MUST WEEP OVER HIS UNTIMELY LOSS TO DIE SO MISERABLY TO FEEL THE MURDERER'S GRASP HOW MUCH MORE A MURDERED THAT COULD DESTROY RADIANT INNOCENCE POOR LITTLE FELLOW
SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED WHO HAD KNOWN HER FOR MANY YEARS AND THEY SPOKE WELL OF HER BUT FEAR AND HATRED OF THE CRIME OF WHICH THEY SUPPOSED HER GUILTY RENDERED THEM TIMOROUS AND UNWILLING TO COME FORWARD
BUT WORDS CANNOT CONVEY AN IDEA OF THE HEART SICKENING DESPAIR THAT I THEN ENDURED THE PERSON TO WHOM I ADDRESSED MYSELF ADDED THAT JUSTINE HAD ALREADY CONFESSED HER GUILT THAT EVIDENCE HE OBSERVED
YET SHE APPEARED CONFIDENT IN INNOCENCE AND DID NOT TREMBLE ALTHOUGH GAZED ON AND EXECRATED BY THOUSANDS FOR ALL THE KINDNESS WHICH HER BEAUTY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE EXCITED WAS OBLITERATED IN THE MINDS OF THE SPECTATORS
A SENSE OF MORTAL AGONY CREPT OVER MY FRAME BEFORE I HAD ONLY IMAGINED THE WRETCHEDNESS OF MY DESOLATED HOME THE REALITY CAME ON ME AS A NEW AND A NOT LESS TERRIBLE DISASTER I TRIED TO CALM ERNEST
ITS GIGANTIC STATURE AND THE DEFORMITY OF ITS ASPECT MORE HIDEOUS THAN BELONGS TO HUMANITY INSTANTLY INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS THE WRETCH THE FILTHY DAEMON TO WHOM I HAD GIVEN LIFE WHAT DID HE THERE
ALAS SAID SHE HOW SHALL I EVER AGAIN BELIEVE IN HUMAN GOODNESS JUSTINE WHOM I LOVED AND ESTEEMED AS MY SISTER HOW COULD SHE PUT ON THOSE SMILES OF INNOCENCE ONLY TO BETRAY HER MILD EYES SEEMED INCAPABLE OF ANY SEVERITY OR GUILE
THE STORM APPEARED TO APPROACH RAPIDLY AND ON LANDING I ASCENDED A LOW HILL THAT I MIGHT OBSERVE ITS PROGRESS IT ADVANCED THE HEAVENS WERE CLOUDED AND I SOON FELT THE RAIN COMING SLOWLY IN LARGE DROPS BUT ITS VIOLENCE QUICKLY INCREASED
ELIZABETH ALSO SUFFERED EXTREME ANGUISH ABOUT FIVE IN THE MORNING I DISCOVERED MY LOVELY BOY WHOM THE NIGHT BEFORE I HAD SEEN BLOOMING AND ACTIVE IN HEALTH STRETCHED ON THE GRASS LIVID AND MOTIONLESS
I ENQUIRED MORE MINUTELY CONCERNING MY FATHER
BUT HERE ALSO I AM CHECKED I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NO ENEMY ON EARTH AND NONE SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO WICKED AS TO DESTROY ME WANTONLY DID THE MURDERER PLACE IT THERE I KNOW OF NO OPPORTUNITY AFFORDED HIM FOR SO DOING
YES SAID ELIZABETH I WILL GO ALTHOUGH SHE IS GUILTY AND YOU VICTOR SHALL ACCOMPANY ME I CANNOT GO ALONE THE IDEA OF THIS VISIT WAS TORTURE TO ME YET I COULD NOT REFUSE
AND REPRESENTED CAROLINE BEAUFORT IN AN AGONY OF DESPAIR KNEELING BY THE COFFIN OF HER DEAD FATHER HER GARB WAS RUSTIC AND HER CHEEK PALE BUT THERE WAS AN AIR OF DIGNITY AND BEAUTY THAT HARDLY PERMITTED THE SENTIMENT OF PITY
ITS DEPARTURE TWO YEARS HAD NOW NEARLY ELAPSED SINCE THE NIGHT ON WHICH HE FIRST RECEIVED LIFE AND WAS THIS HIS FIRST CRIME ALAS I HAD TURNED LOOSE INTO THE WORLD A DEPRAVED WRETCH WHOSE DELIGHT WAS IN CARNAGE AND MISERY
I ATTEMPTED TO PREVENT HER BUT SHE PERSISTED AND ENTERING THE ROOM WHERE IT LAY HASTILY EXAMINED THE NECK OF THE VICTIM AND CLASPING HER HANDS EXCLAIMED O GOD I HAVE MURDERED MY DARLING CHILD SHE FAINTED AND WAS RESTORED WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY
AND WHICH WOULD GIVE AN AIR OF DELIRIUM TO A TALE OTHERWISE SO UTTERLY IMPROBABLE I WELL KNEW THAT IF ANY OTHER HAD COMMUNICATED SUCH A RELATION TO ME
ELIZABETH SAW EVEN THIS LAST RESOURCE HER EXCELLENT DISPOSITIONS AND IRREPROACHABLE CONDUCT ABOUT TO FAIL THE ACCUSED WHEN ALTHOUGH VIOLENTLY AGITATED SHE DESIRED PERMISSION TO ADDRESS THE COURT
HE WHO WOULD SPEND EACH VITAL DROP OF BLOOD FOR YOUR SAKES WHO HAS NO THOUGHT NOR SENSE OF JOY EXCEPT AS IT IS MIRRORED ALSO IN YOUR DEAR COUNTENANCES WHO WOULD FILL THE AIR WITH BLESSINGS AND SPEND HIS LIFE IN SERVING YOU HE BIDS YOU WEEP
JUDGED INDECENT IN ME TO COME FORWARD ON THIS OCCASION BUT WHEN I SEE A FELLOW CREATURE ABOUT TO PERISH THROUGH THE COWARDICE OF HER PRETENDED FRIENDS I WISH TO BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK THAT I MAY SAY WHAT I KNOW OF HER CHARACTER
I HURRIED INTO A CABRIOLET AND BADE FAREWELL TO MY FRIEND MY JOURNEY WAS VERY MELANCHOLY AT FIRST I WISHED TO HURRY ON FOR I LONGED TO CONSOLE AND SYMPATHISE WITH MY LOVED AND SORROWING FRIENDS BUT WHEN I DREW NEAR MY NATIVE TOWN
I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN REPLIED MY BROTHER IN ACCENTS OF WONDER BUT TO US THE DISCOVERY WE HAVE MADE COMPLETES OUR MISERY NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE IT AT FIRST AND EVEN NOW ELIZABETH WILL NOT BE CONVINCED
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS TO DISCOVER WHAT I KNEW OF THE MURDERER AND CAUSE INSTANT PURSUIT TO BE MADE BUT I PAUSED WHEN I REFLECTED ON THE STORY THAT I HAD TO TELL A BEING WHOM I MYSELF HAD FORMED AND ENDUED WITH LIFE
NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE BODY OF THE MURDERED CHILD HAD BEEN AFTERWARDS FOUND THE WOMAN ASKED HER WHAT SHE DID THERE BUT SHE LOOKED VERY STRANGELY AND ONLY RETURNED A CONFUSED AND UNINTELLIGIBLE ANSWER SHE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK
A HILL THAT BOUNDS PLAINPALAIS ON THE SOUTH HE SOON REACHED THE SUMMIT AND DISAPPEARED I REMAINED MOTIONLESS THE THUNDER CEASED
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VAIN FOR ANOTHER FLASH DISCOVERED HIM TO ME HANGING AMONG THE ROCKS OF THE NEARLY PERPENDICULAR ASCENT
I SOON SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN IN HEAVEN WHERE WE SHALL ALL BE HAPPY AND THAT CONSOLES ME GOING AS I AM TO SUFFER IGNOMINY AND DEATH OH JUSTINE
THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE EVIDENCE PRODUCED AGAINST HER I BELIEVE AND RELY ON HER PERFECT INNOCENCE SHE HAD NO TEMPTATION FOR SUCH AN ACTION AS TO THE BAUBLE ON WHICH THE CHIEF PROOF RESTS
OR IF I HAD WHY SHOULD HE HAVE STOLEN THE JEWEL TO PART WITH IT AGAIN SO SOON I COMMIT MY CAUSE TO THE JUSTICE OF MY JUDGES YET I SEE NO ROOM FOR HOPE
WHEN SHE AGAIN LIVED IT WAS ONLY TO WEEP AND SIGH SHE TOLD ME THAT THAT SAME EVENING WILLIAM HAD TEASED HER TO LET HIM WEAR A VERY VALUABLE MINIATURE THAT SHE POSSESSED OF YOUR MOTHER THIS PICTURE IS GONE
AND THE OFFICER GUESSED THE CAUSE OF MY VISIT THE BALLOTS HAD BEEN THROWN THEY WERE ALL BLACK AND JUSTINE WAS CONDEMNED I CANNOT PRETEND TO DESCRIBE WHAT I THEN FELT I HAD BEFORE EXPERIENCED SENSATIONS OF HORROR
I PASSED A NIGHT OF UNMINGLED WRETCHEDNESS IN THE MORNING I WENT TO THE COURT MY LIPS AND THROAT WERE PARCHED I DARED NOT ASK THE FATAL QUESTION BUT I WAS KNOWN
FAREWELL SWEET LADY DEAREST ELIZABETH MY BELOVED AND ONLY FRIEND MAY HEAVEN IN ITS BOUNTY BLESS AND PRESERVE YOU MAY THIS BE THE LAST MISFORTUNE THAT YOU WILL EVER SUFFER LIVE AND BE HAPPY
WE HAVE NOT ONLY LOST THAT LOVELY DARLING BOY BUT THIS POOR GIRL WHOM I SINCERELY LOVE IS TO BE TORN AWAY BY EVEN A WORSE FATE IF SHE IS CONDEMNED I NEVER SHALL KNOW JOY MORE BUT SHE WILL NOT I AM SURE SHE WILL NOT
DURING THIS CONVERSATION I HAD RETIRED TO A CORNER OF THE PRISON ROOM WHERE I COULD CONCEAL THE HORRID ANGUISH THAT POSSESSED ME DESPAIR WHO DARED TALK OF THAT
TO GO INSTANTLY TO GENEVA COME WITH ME HENRY TO ORDER THE HORSES DURING OUR WALK CLERVAL ENDEAVOURED TO SAY A FEW WORDS OF CONSOLATION HE COULD ONLY EXPRESS HIS HEARTFELT SYMPATHY POOR WILLIAM SAID HE DEAR LOVELY CHILD
AND WHEN ONE INQUIRED WHERE SHE HAD PASSED THE NIGHT SHE REPLIED THAT SHE HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR THE CHILD AND DEMANDED EARNESTLY IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN HEARD CONCERNING HIM WHEN SHOWN THE BODY SHE FELL INTO VIOLENT HYSTERICS AND KEPT HER BED FOR SEVERAL DAYS
WHO BUT A NATIVE CAN TELL THE DELIGHT I TOOK IN AGAIN BEHOLDING THY STREAMS THY MOUNTAINS AND MORE THAN ALL THY LOVELY LAKE YET AS I DREW NEARER HOME GRIEF AND FEAR AGAIN OVERCAME ME
SHE NURSED MADAME FRANKENSTEIN MY AUNT IN HER LAST ILLNESS WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION AND CARE AND AFTERWARDS ATTENDED HER OWN MOTHER DURING A TEDIOUS ILLNESS IN A MANNER THAT EXCITED THE ADMIRATION OF ALL WHO KNEW HER
I BEG PERMISSION TO HAVE A FEW WITNESSES EXAMINED CONCERNING MY CHARACTER AND IF THEIR TESTIMONY SHALL NOT OVERWEIGH MY SUPPOSED GUILT I MUST BE CONDEMNED ALTHOUGH I WOULD PLEDGE MY SALVATION ON MY INNOCENCE
AND WHOM YOU LOVED WAS A CREATURE CAPABLE OF A CRIME WHICH NONE BUT THE DEVIL HIMSELF COULD HAVE PERPETRATED DEAR WILLIAM
I WANDERED ON WITH A HASTY STEP THIS NOBLE WAR IN THE SKY ELEVATED MY SPIRITS I CLASPED MY HANDS AND EXCLAIMED ALOUD WILLIAM DEAR ANGEL
BUT THE RAIN STILL CONTINUED AND THE SCENE WAS ENVELOPED IN AN IMPENETRABLE DARKNESS I REVOLVED IN MY MIND THE EVENTS WHICH I HAD UNTIL NOW SOUGHT TO FORGET THE WHOLE TRAIN OF MY PROGRESS TOWARD THE CREATION THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORKS OF MY OWN HANDS AT MY BEDSIDE
WAS HARDLY REQUIRED IN SO GLARING A CASE BUT I AM GLAD OF IT AND INDEED NONE OF OUR JUDGES LIKE TO CONDEMN A CRIMINAL UPON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE BE IT EVER SO DECISIVE THIS WAS STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED INTELLIGENCE
AND THEN I SHALL BE HAPPY AGAIN EVEN AFTER THE SAD DEATH OF MY LITTLE WILLIAM SHE IS INNOCENT MY ELIZABETH SAID I AND THAT SHALL BE PROVED FEAR NOTHING BUT LET YOUR SPIRITS BE CHEERED BY THE ASSURANCE OF HER ACQUITTAL
I SHOULD HAVE WILLINGLY GIVEN IT TO HER SO MUCH DO I ESTEEM AND VALUE HER A MURMUR OF APPROBATION FOLLOWED ELIZABETH'S SIMPLE AND POWERFUL APPEAL BUT IT WAS EXCITED BY HER GENEROUS INTERFERENCE AND NOT IN FAVOUR OF POOR JUSTINE
I CONFESSED THAT I MIGHT OBTAIN ABSOLUTION BUT NOW THAT FALSEHOOD LIES HEAVIER AT MY HEART THAN ALL MY OTHER SINS THE GOD OF HEAVEN FORGIVE ME EVER SINCE I WAS CONDEMNED MY CONFESSOR HAS BESIEGED ME
THE PICTURE WAS THEN PRODUCED WHICH THE SERVANT HAD FOUND IN HER POCKET AND WHEN ELIZABETH IN A FALTERING VOICE PROVED THAT IT WAS THE SAME WHICH AN HOUR BEFORE THE CHILD HAD BEEN MISSED SHE HAD PLACED ROUND HIS NECK
AND AFTER WE HAD EXCHANGED OUR MOURNFUL GREETING WOULD HAVE INTRODUCED SOME OTHER TOPIC THAN THAT OF OUR DISASTER HAD NOT ERNEST EXCLAIMED GOOD GOD PAPA
I WAS NOT SO MISERABLE AS I AM NOW AND DO YOU ALSO BELIEVE THAT I AM SO VERY VERY WICKED DO YOU ALSO JOIN WITH MY ENEMIES TO CRUSH ME TO CONDEMN ME AS A MURDERER HER VOICE WAS SUFFOCATED WITH SOBS
YOU ALONE CAN CONSOLE ELIZABETH SHE WEEPS CONTINUALLY AND ACCUSES HERSELF UNJUSTLY AS THE CAUSE OF HIS DEATH HER WORDS PIERCE MY HEART WE ARE ALL UNHAPPY BUT WILL NOT THAT BE AN ADDITIONAL MOTIVE FOR YOU MY SON TO RETURN AND BE OUR COMFORTER
WE DO ALSO UNFORTUNATELY REPLIED MY FATHER FOR INDEED I HAD RATHER HAVE BEEN FOR EVER IGNORANT THAN HAVE DISCOVERED SO MUCH DEPRAVITY AND UNGRATITUDE IN ONE I VALUED SO HIGHLY MY DEAR FATHER YOU ARE MISTAKEN JUSTINE IS INNOCENT
CHAPTER EIGHT WE PASSED A FEW SAD HOURS UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN THE TRIAL WAS TO COMMENCE MY FATHER AND THE REST OF THE FAMILY BEING OBLIGED TO ATTEND AS WITNESSES I ACCOMPANIED THEM TO THE COURT
ONE ONLY CONSOLATION HAVE WE HIS FRIENDS MOURN AND WEEP BUT HE IS AT REST THE PANG IS OVER HIS SUFFERINGS ARE AT AN END FOR EVER A SOD COVERS HIS GENTLE FORM AND HE KNOWS NO PAIN HE CAN NO LONGER BE A SUBJECT FOR PITY
IN THESE LAST MOMENTS I FEEL THE SINCEREST GRATITUDE TOWARDS THOSE WHO THINK OF ME WITH KINDNESS HOW SWEET IS THE AFFECTION OF OTHERS TO SUCH A WRETCH AS I AM IT REMOVES MORE THAN HALF MY MISFORTUNE
HORROR AND MISERY WERE STRONGLY EXPRESSED SOMETIMES SHE STRUGGLED WITH HER TEARS BUT WHEN SHE WAS DESIRED TO PLEAD SHE COLLECTED HER POWERS AND SPOKE IN AN AUDIBLE
HAD MET ME AT MIDNIGHT AMONG THE PRECIPICES OF AN INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAIN
ALL WAS THE WORK OF MY THRICE ACCURSED HANDS YE WEEP UNHAPPY ONES BUT THESE ARE NOT YOUR LAST TEARS AGAIN SHALL YOU RAISE THE FUNERAL WAIL AND THE SOUND OF YOUR LAMENTATIONS SHALL AGAIN AND AGAIN BE HEARD FRANKENSTEIN
NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE EVIDENCE INDEED WHO WOULD CREDIT THAT JUSTINE MORITZ WHO WAS SO AMIABLE AND FOND OF ALL THE FAMILY COULD SUDDENLY BECOME SO CAPABLE OF SO FRIGHTFUL SO APPALLING A CRIME JUSTINE MORITZ
AND I FEEL AS IF I COULD DIE IN PEACE NOW THAT MY INNOCENCE IS ACKNOWLEDGED BY YOU DEAR LADY AND YOUR COUSIN THUS THE POOR SUFFERER TRIED TO COMFORT OTHERS AND HERSELF
WHICH STOOD OVER THE MANTEL PIECE IT WAS AN HISTORICAL SUBJECT
WHEN ELIZABETH CONJECTURED THAT HE MIGHT HAVE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE HE WAS NOT THERE WE RETURNED AGAIN WITH TORCHES FOR I COULD NOT REST WHEN I THOUGHT THAT MY SWEET BOY HAD LOST HIMSELF AND WAS EXPOSED TO ALL THE DAMPS AND DEWS OF NIGHT
BELOW THIS PICTURE WAS A MINIATURE OF WILLIAM AND MY TEARS FLOWED WHEN I LOOKED UPON IT WHILE I WAS THUS ENGAGED ERNEST ENTERED
VICTOR HE IS MURDERED I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO CONSOLE YOU BUT WILL SIMPLY RELATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TRANSACTION LAST THURSDAY MAY SEVENTH I MY NIECE AND YOUR TWO BROTHERS WENT TO WALK IN PLAINPALAIS
ALL LOOKED ON ME AS A WRETCH DOOMED TO IGNOMINY AND PERDITION WHAT COULD I DO IN AN EVIL HOUR I SUBSCRIBED TO A LIE AND NOW ONLY AM I TRULY MISERABLE SHE PAUSED WEEPING
UNTIL THE EYE RECOVERED ITSELF FROM THE PRECEDING FLASH THE STORM AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN SWITZERLAND APPEARED AT ONCE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE HEAVENS THE MOST VIOLENT STORM HUNG EXACTLY NORTH OF THE TOWN OVER THE PART OF THE LAKE WHICH LIES BETWEEN THE PROMONTORY OF BELRIVE
I BORE A HELL WITHIN ME WHICH NOTHING COULD EXTINGUISH WE STAYED SEVERAL HOURS WITH JUSTINE AND IT WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT ELIZABETH COULD TEAR HERSELF AWAY I WISH CRIED SHE THAT I WERE TO DIE WITH YOU
NIGHT ALSO CLOSED AROUND AND WHEN I COULD HARDLY SEE THE DARK MOUNTAINS I FELT STILL MORE GLOOMILY THE PICTURE APPEARED A VAST AND DIM SCENE OF EVIL AND I FORESAW OBSCURELY THAT I WAS DESTINED TO BECOME THE MOST WRETCHED OF HUMAN BEINGS
MY COUSIN REPLIED I IT IS DECIDED AS YOU MAY HAVE EXPECTED ALL JUDGES HAD RATHER THAT TEN INNOCENT SHOULD SUFFER THAN THAT ONE GUILTY SHOULD ESCAPE BUT SHE HAS CONFESSED
A VILLAGE AT THE DISTANCE OF HALF A LEAGUE FROM THE CITY THE SKY WAS SERENE AND AS I WAS UNABLE TO REST I RESOLVED TO VISIT THE SPOT WHERE MY POOR WILLIAM HAD BEEN MURDERED AS I COULD NOT PASS THROUGH THE TOWN I WAS OBLIGED TO CROSS THE LAKE IN A BOAT TO ARRIVE AT PLAINPALAIS
THAT REPORT YOU SAY IS FALSE AND BE ASSURED DEAR JUSTINE THAT NOTHING CAN SHAKE MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU FOR A MOMENT BUT YOUR OWN CONFESSION I DID CONFESS BUT I CONFESSED A LIE
I REST MY INNOCENCE ON A PLAIN AND SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF THE FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDUCED AGAINST ME AND I HOPE THE CHARACTER I HAVE ALWAYS BORNE WILL INCLINE MY JUDGES TO A FAVOURABLE INTERPRETATION WHERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE APPEARS DOUBTFUL OR SUSPICIOUS
I AM WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ACCUSED I HAVE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HER AT ONE TIME FOR FIVE AND AT ANOTHER FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS DURING ALL THAT PERIOD SHE APPEARED TO ME THE MOST AMIABLE AND BENEVOLENT OF HUMAN CREATURES
SHE THREW HERSELF AT THE FEET OF ELIZABETH WEEPING BITTERLY MY COUSIN WEPT ALSO OH JUSTINE SAID SHE WHY DID YOU ROB ME OF MY LAST CONSOLATION I RELIED ON YOUR INNOCENCE AND ALTHOUGH I WAS THEN VERY WRETCHED
ON WHOM THE PUBLIC INDIGNATION WAS TURNED WITH RENEWED VIOLENCE CHARGING HER WITH THE BLACKEST INGRATITUDE SHE HERSELF WEPT AS ELIZABETH SPOKE BUT SHE DID NOT ANSWER MY OWN AGITATION AND ANGUISH WAS EXTREME DURING THE WHOLE TRIAL
CLERVAL WHO HAD WATCHED MY COUNTENANCE AS I READ THIS LETTER WAS SURPRISED TO OBSERVE THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEEDED THE JOY I AT FIRST EXPRESSED ON RECEIVING NEW FROM MY FRIENDS
RISE MY POOR GIRL SAID ELIZABETH WHY DO YOU KNEEL IF YOU ARE INNOCENT I AM NOT ONE OF YOUR ENEMIES I BELIEVED YOU GUILTLESS NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY EVIDENCE UNTIL I HEARD THAT YOU HAD YOURSELF DECLARED YOUR GUILT
YOU PERHAPS WILL FIND SOME MEANS TO JUSTIFY MY POOR GUILTLESS JUSTINE ALAS WHO IS SAFE IF SHE BE CONVICTED OF CRIME I RELY ON HER INNOCENCE AS CERTAINLY AS I DO UPON MY OWN OUR MISFORTUNE IS DOUBLY HARD TO US
SIX YEARS HAD ELAPSED PASSED IN A DREAM BUT FOR ONE INDELIBLE TRACE AND I STOOD IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE I HAD LAST EMBRACED MY FATHER BEFORE MY DEPARTURE FOR INGOLSTADT BELOVED AND VENERABLE PARENT
AND A LOOK OF SORROWFUL AFFECTION SEEMED TO ATTEST HER UTTER GUILTLESSNESS THE TRIAL BEGAN AND AFTER THE ADVOCATE AGAINST HER HAD STATED THE CHARGE SEVERAL WITNESSES WERE CALLED SEVERAL STRANGE FACTS COMBINED AGAINST HER
HAD HE NOT MURDERED MY BROTHER NO ONE CAN CONCEIVE THE ANGUISH I SUFFERED DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT WHICH I SPENT COLD AND WET IN THE OPEN AIR BUT I DID NOT FEEL THE INCONVENIENCE OF THE WEATHER
I REMAINED TWO DAYS AT LAUSANNE
I FEAR MY FRIEND THAT I SHALL RENDER MYSELF TEDIOUS BY DWELLING ON THESE PRELIMINARY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY WERE DAYS OF COMPARATIVE HAPPINESS AND I THINK OF THEM WITH PLEASURE MY COUNTRY MY BELOVED COUNTRY
BELONGING TO A COTTAGE BEING UNWILLING TO CALL UP THE INHABITANTS TO WHOM SHE WAS WELL KNOWN MOST OF THE NIGHT SHE SPENT HERE WATCHING TOWARDS MORNING SHE BELIEVED THAT SHE SLEPT FOR A FEW MINUTES SOME STEPS DISTURBED HER AND SHE AWOKE
I QUITTED MY SEAT AND WALKED ON ALTHOUGH THE DARKNESS AND STORM INCREASED EVERY MINUTE AND THE THUNDER BURST WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH OVER MY HEAD IT WAS ECHOED FROM SALEVE THE JURAS AND THE ALPS OF SAVOY
AND THEN CONTINUED I THOUGHT WITH HORROR MY SWEET LADY
THERE WAS THE SAME CANDOUR THE SAME VIVACITY BUT IT WAS ALLIED TO AN EXPRESSION MORE FULL OF SENSIBILITY AND INTELLECT SHE WELCOMED ME WITH THE GREATEST AFFECTION YOUR ARRIVAL MY DEAR COUSIN SAID SHE FILLS ME WITH HOPE
THE MURDERER OF MY BROTHER NO SOONER DID THAT IDEA CROSS MY IMAGINATION THAN I BECAME CONVINCED OF ITS TRUTH MY TEETH CHATTERED AND I WAS FORCED TO LEAN AGAINST A TREE FOR SUPPORT THE FIGURE PASSED ME QUICKLY AND I LOST IT IN THE GLOOM
AND HEARD THE HARSH UNFEELING REASONING OF THESE MEN MY PURPOSED AVOWAL DIED AWAY ON MY LIPS THUS I MIGHT PROCLAIM MYSELF A MADMAN BUT NOT REVOKE THE SENTENCE PASSED UPON MY WRETCHED VICTIM SHE PERISHED ON THE SCAFFOLD
I CONTEMPLATED THE LAKE THE WATERS WERE PLACID ALL AROUND WAS CALM AND THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS THE PALACES OF NATURE WERE NOT CHANGED BY DEGREES THE CALM AND HEAVENLY SCENE RESTORED ME AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY TOWARDS GENEVA
WE MUST RESERVE THAT FOR HIS MISERABLE SURVIVORS CLERVAL SPOKE THUS AS WE HURRIED THROUGH THE STREETS THE WORDS IMPRESSED THEMSELVES ON MY MIND AND I REMEMBERED THEM AFTERWARDS IN SOLITUDE BUT NOW AS SOON AS THE HORSES ARRIVED
NOTHING IN HUMAN SHAPE COULD HAVE DESTROYED THE FAIR CHILD HE WAS THE MURDERER I COULD NOT DOUBT IT THE MERE PRESENCE OF THE IDEA WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF THE FACT I THOUGHT OF PURSUING THE DEVIL
GOD KNOWS SHE SAID HOW ENTIRELY I AM INNOCENT BUT I DO NOT PRETEND THAT MY PROTESTATIONS SHOULD ACQUIT ME
BESIDES THE STRANGE NATURE OF THE ANIMAL WOULD ELUDE ALL PURSUIT EVEN IF I WERE SO FAR CREDITED AS TO PERSUADE MY RELATIVES TO COMMENCE IT AND THEN OF WHAT USE WOULD BE PURSUIT WHO COULD ARREST A CREATURE CAPABLE OF SCALING THE OVERHANGING SIDES OF MONT SALEVE
SHE INDEED GAINED THE RESIGNATION SHE DESIRED BUT I THE TRUE MURDERER FELT THE NEVER DYING WORM ALIVE IN MY BOSOM WHICH ALLOWED OF NO HOPE OR CONSOLATION ELIZABETH ALSO WEPT AND WAS UNHAPPY
MY OWN SPIRIT LET LOOSE FROM THE GRAVE AND FORCED TO DESTROY ALL THAT WAS DEAR TO ME DAY DAWNED AND I DIRECTED MY STEPS TOWARDS THE TOWN THE GATES WERE OPEN AND I HASTENED TO MY FATHER'S HOUSE
TO SHED COUNTLESS TEARS HAPPY BEYOND HIS HOPES IF THUS INEXORABLE FATE BE SATISFIED AND IF THE DESTRUCTION PAUSE BEFORE THE PEACE OF THE GRAVE HAVE SUCCEEDED TO YOUR SAD TORMENTS
HOW HEAVILY AND FATALLY THIS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE WEIGHS AGAINST ME BUT I HAVE NO POWER OF EXPLAINING IT AND WHEN I HAVE EXPRESSED MY UTTER IGNORANCE I AM ONLY LEFT TO CONJECTURE CONCERNING THE PROBABILITIES BY WHICH IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLACED IN MY POCKET
BUT THAT HE DID NOT RETURN THIS ACCOUNT
AND INDEED EVERY HUMAN BEING WAS GUILTLESS OF THIS MURDER I HAD NO FEAR THEREFORE THAT ANY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE COULD BE BROUGHT FORWARD STRONG ENOUGH TO CONVICT HER MY TALE WAS NOT ONE TO ANNOUNCE PUBLICLY ITS ASTOUNDING HORROR WOULD BE LOOKED UPON AS MADNESS BY THE VULGAR
HAD ALREADY CONDEMNED MY UNHAPPY VICTIM I RUSHED OUT OF THE COURT IN AGONY THE TORTURES OF THE ACCUSED DID NOT EQUAL MINE SHE WAS SUSTAINED BY INNOCENCE BUT THE FANGS OF REMORSE TORE MY BOSOM AND WOULD NOT FORGO THEIR HOLD
A MURMUR OF HORROR AND INDIGNATION FILLED THE COURT JUSTINE WAS CALLED ON FOR HER DEFENCE AS THE TRIAL HAD PROCEEDED HER COUNTENANCE HAD ALTERED SURPRISE
THE ROAD RAN BY THE SIDE OF THE LAKE WHICH BECAME NARROWER AS I APPROACHED MY NATIVE TOWN I DISCOVERED MORE DISTINCTLY THE BLACK SIDES OF JURA AND THE
BY MY TEARS AND PRAYERS YOU SHALL NOT DIE YOU MY PLAYFELLOW MY COMPANION
I SLACKENED MY PROGRESS I COULD HARDLY SUSTAIN THE MULTITUDE OF FEELINGS THAT CROWDED INTO MY MIND I PASSED THROUGH SCENES FAMILIAR TO MY YOUTH BUT WHICH I HAD NOT SEEN FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS HOW ALTERED EVERY THING MIGHT BE DURING THAT TIME
YOUR AFFECTIONATE AND AFFLICTED FATHER ALPHONSE FRANKENSTEIN GENEVA MAY TWELFTH
THUS SPOKE MY PROPHETIC SOUL AS TORN BY REMORSE HORROR AND DESPAIR I BEHELD THOSE I LOVED SPEND VAIN SORROW UPON THE GRAVES OF WILLIAM AND JUSTINE
BUT WITH FEELINGS OF PEACE AND GENTLENESS THAT WILL HEAL INSTEAD OF FESTERING THE WOUNDS OF OUR MINDS ENTER THE HOUSE OF MOURNING MY FRIEND BUT WITH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION FOR THOSE WHO LOVE YOU AND NOT WITH HATRED FOR YOUR ENEMIES
ALAS I PROPHESIED TRULY AND FAILED ONLY IN ONE SINGLE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN ALL THE MISERY I IMAGINED AND DREADED I DID NOT CONCEIVE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF THE ANGUISH I WAS DESTINED TO ENDURE
JUSTINE SHOOK HER HEAD MOURNFULLY I DO NOT FEAR TO DIE SHE SAID THAT PANG IS PAST GOD RAISES MY WEAKNESS AND GIVES ME COURAGE TO ENDURE THE WORST
IT WAS DAWN AND SHE QUITTED HER ASYLUM THAT SHE MIGHT AGAIN ENDEAVOUR TO FIND MY BROTHER IF SHE HAD GONE NEAR THE SPOT WHERE HIS BODY LAY IT WAS WITHOUT HER KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE HAD BEEN BEWILDERED WHEN QUESTIONED BY THE MARKET WOMAN WAS NOT SURPRISING
I CANNOT LIVE IN THIS WORLD OF MISERY JUSTINE ASSUMED AN AIR OF CHEERFULNESS WHILE SHE WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSED HER BITTER TEARS SHE EMBRACED ELIZABETH AND SAID IN A VOICE OF HALF SUPPRESSED EMOTION
AS A MURDERESS FROM THE TORTURES OF MY OWN HEART I TURNED TO CONTEMPLATE THE DEEP AND VOICELESS GRIEF OF MY ELIZABETH THIS ALSO WAS MY DOING AND MY FATHER'S WOE AND THE DESOLATION OF THAT LATE SO SMILING HOME
MAKES WITH ITS LIGHT THE HEAVEN FOREVER QUIET WHEREIN THAT TURNS WHICH HAS THE GREATEST HASTE AND THITHER NOW AS TO A SITE DECREED BEARS US AWAY THE VIRTUE OF THAT CORD
MUST BE PERFORCE THE FRUITS OF FORMAL PRINCIPLES AND THESE SAVE ONE OF COURSE WOULD BY THY REASONING BE DESTROYED BESIDES IF RARITY WERE OF THIS DIMNESS THE CAUSE THOU ASKEST
WITH THE PRECIOUS BODY THAT IT QUICKENS IN WHICH AS LIFE IN YOU IT IS COMBINED FROM THE GLAD NATURE WHENCE IT IS DERIVED THE MINGLED VIRTUE THROUGH THE BODY SHINES EVEN AS GLADNESS THROUGH THE LIVING PUPIL
THAT UNTIL DEATH THEY MAY BOTH WATCH AND SLEEP BESIDE THAT SPOUSE WHO EVERY VOW ACCEPTS WHICH CHARITY CONFORMETH TO HIS PLEASURE
THOU'LT SEE HOW I FROM THESE WAS IN DESIRE OF HEARING THEIR CONDITIONS AS THEY UNTO MINE EYES WERE MANIFEST O THOU WELL BORN UNTO WHOM GRACE CONCEDES TO SEE THE THRONES OF THE ETERNAL TRIUMPH
TOWARDS ME TURNING BLITHE AS BEAUTIFUL SAID UNTO ME FIX GRATEFULLY THY MIND ON GOD WHO UNTO THE FIRST STAR HAS BROUGHT US
SO THAT FORTH IT DOES NOT BREATHE THOU ARGUEST IF GOOD WILL BE PERMANENT THE VIOLENCE OF OTHERS FOR WHAT REASON DOTH IT DECREASE THE MEASURE OF MY MERIT AGAIN FOR DOUBTING
FROM THIS PROCEEDS WHATE'ER FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT APPEARETH DIFFERENT NOT FROM DENSE AND RARE THIS IS THE FORMAL PRINCIPLE THAT PRODUCES ACCORDING TO ITS GOODNESS DARK AND BRIGHT
THE HAVING HEARD WITHOUT RETAINING IT IN THE ESSENCE OF THIS SACRIFICE TWO THINGS CONVENE TOGETHER AND THE ONE IS THAT OF WHICH TIS MADE THE OTHER IS THE AGREEMENT THIS LAST FOR EVERMORE IS CANCELLED NOT
AS ONE WHOM TOO GREAT EAGERNESS BEWILDERS O WELL CREATED SPIRIT WHO IN THE RAYS OF LIFE ETERNAL DOST THE SWEETNESS TASTE WHICH BEING UNTASTED NE'ER IS COMPREHENDED
IF THIS WERE CAUSED BY RARE AND DENSE ALONE ONE ONLY VIRTUE WOULD THERE BE IN ALL OR MORE OR LESS DIFFUSED OR EQUALLY VIRTUES DIVERSE
FORASMUCH AS FOLLOWING THE SENSES THOU SEEST THAT THE REASON HAS SHORT WINGS BUT TELL ME WHAT THOU THINK'ST OF IT THYSELF AND I
MY SIGHT THAT FOLLOWED HER
SINCE FROM ABOVE THEY TAKE AND ACT BENEATH OBSERVE ME WELL HOW THROUGH THIS PLACE I COME UNTO THE TRUTH THOU WISHEST THAT HEREAFTER THOU MAYST ALONE KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE FORD
THEREFORE IS GIVEN US BECAUSE OUR VOWS HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED AND IN SOME PART VOID WHENCE I TO HER IN YOUR MIRACULOUS ASPECTS THERE SHINES I KNOW NOT WHAT OF THE DIVINE
THEREFORE WHATEVER THING HAS SO GREAT WEIGHT IN VALUE THAT IT DRAGS DOWN EVERY BALANCE CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH OTHER SPENDING LET MORTALS NEVER TAKE A VOW IN JEST
TO ALL THE REALM TIS PLEASING AS TO THE KING WHO MAKES HIS WILL OUR WILL AND HIS WILL IS OUR PEACE THIS IS THE SEA TO WHICH IS MOVING ONWARD WHATSOEVER IT DOTH CREATE
INTO THE LIGHT OF MY SWEET GUIDE WHO SMILING KINDLED IN HER HOLY EYES MARVEL THOU NOT SHE SAID TO ME BECAUSE I SMILE AT THIS THY PUERILE CONCEIT
TO LEARN FROM HER WHAT WAS THE WEB WHEREIN SHE DID NOT PLY THE SHUTTLE TO THE END A PERFECT LIFE AND MERIT HIGH IN HEAVEN A LADY O'ER US SAID SHE BY WHOSE RULE DOWN IN YOUR WORLD THEY VEST AND VEIL THEMSELVES
AND ALL THAT NATURE MAKES THEN IT WAS CLEAR TO ME HOW EVERYWHERE IN HEAVEN IS PARADISE ALTHOUGH THE GRACE OF GOOD SUPREME THERE RAIN NOT IN ONE MEASURE BUT AS IT COMES TO PASS
AND BY BEATRICE SPEAK SPEAK SECURELY AND BELIEVE THEM EVEN AS GODS WELL I PERCEIVE HOW THOU DOST NEST THYSELF IN THINE OWN LIGHT AND DRAWEST IT FROM THINE EYES
WHEREAT SHE PROMPTLY AND WITH LAUGHING EYES OUR CHARITY DOTH NEVER SHUT THE DOORS AGAINST A JUST DESIRE EXCEPT AS ONE WHO WILLS THAT ALL HER COURT BE LIKE HERSELF
THAT MAKES THE UNIVERSE RESEMBLE GOD HERE DO THE HIGHER CREATURES SEE THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE ETERNAL POWER WHICH IS THE END
WHEN IT HAD LOST HER TURNED ROUND UNTO THE MARK OF MORE DESIRE AND WHOLLY UNTO BEATRICE REVERTED BUT SHE SUCH LIGHTNINGS FLASHED INTO MINE EYES
WHICH IS KNOWN TO THEE AS MATTER MAY WELL INDEED BE SUCH THAT ONE ERRS NOT
I CAN MAKE MANIFEST THOU'LT SEE ME COME UNTO THY DARLING TREE AND CROWN MYSELF THEREAFTER WITH THOSE LEAVES OF WHICH THE THEME AND THOU SHALL MAKE ME WORTHY SO SELDOM FATHER DO WE GATHER THEM
SHE HEAVENWARD TURNED AGAIN HER FACE PARADISO CANTO TWO
WHERE'ER THE KEY OF SENSE DOTH NOT UNLOCK
SINCE ON THE TRUTH IT TRUSTS NOT YET ITS FOOT BUT TURNS THEE AS TIS WONT ON EMPTINESS TRUE SUBSTANCES ARE THESE WHICH THOU BEHOLDEST HERE RELEGATE FOR BREAKING OF SOME VOW THEREFORE SPEAK WITH THEM
ON THIS ACCOUNT
ALL OUR AFFECTIONS THAT ALONE INFLAMED ARE IN THE PLEASURE OF THE HOLY GHOST REJOICE AT BEING OF HIS ORDER FORMED AND THIS ALLOTMENT WHICH APPEARS SO LOW
THEREAFTER ANSWERED ME SO FULL OF GLADNESS SHE SEEMED TO BURN IN THE FIRST FIRE OF LOVE BROTHER OUR WILL IS QUIETED BY VIRTUE OF CHARITY
WITH GAINS ILL GOTTEN THOU WOULDST DO GOOD DEED NOW ART THOU CERTAIN OF THE GREATER POINT BUT BECAUSE HOLY CHURCH IN THIS DISPENSES WHICH SEEMS AGAINST THE TRUTH WHICH I HAVE SHOWN THEE
BECAUSE THEY CORUSCATE WHEN THOU DOST SMILE BUT KNOW NOT WHO THOU ART NOR WHY THOU HAST SPIRIT AUGUST THY STATION IN THE SPHERE THAT VEILS ITSELF TO MEN IN ALIEN RAYS
OR EVER YET THE WARFARE BE ABANDONED WITH LIGHT THAT THROUGH THE WHOLE OF HEAVEN IS SPREAD KINDLED ARE WE AND HENCE IF THOU DESIREST TO KNOW OF US AT THINE OWN PLEASURE SATE THEE
WHAT BECAME I WHO BY MY NATURE AM EXCEEDING MUTABLE IN EVERY GUISE AS IN A FISH POND WHICH IS PURE AND TRANQUIL THE FISHES DRAW TO THAT WHICH FROM WITHOUT COMES IN SUCH FASHION THAT THEIR FOOD THEY DEEM IT
DOTH DEVIATE SOMETIMES THE CREATURE WHO THE POWER POSSESSES THOUGH THUS IMPELLED TO SWERVE SOME OTHER WAY IN THE SAME WISE AS ONE MAY SEE THE FIRE FALL FROM A CLOUD
O DIVINE SAID I FORTHWITH WHOSE SPEECH INUNDATES ME AND WARMS ME SO IT MORE AND MORE REVIVES ME MY OWN AFFECTION IS NOT SO PROFOUND AS TO SUFFICE IN RENDERING GRACE FOR GRACE
IS FOLLOWED BY GREAT FLAME PERCHANCE WITH BETTER VOICES AFTER ME SHALL PRAYER BE MADE THAT CYRRHA MAY RESPOND TO MORTAL MEN BY PASSAGES DIVERSE UPRISES THE WORLD'S LAMP
AND PLEDGED ME TO THE PATHWAY OF HER SECT THEN MEN ACCUSTOMED UNTO EVIL MORE THAN UNTO GOOD FROM THE SWEET CLOISTER TORE ME GOD KNOWS WHAT AFTERWARD MY LIFE BECAME
AND FEET AND HANDS TO GOD ATTRIBUTES AND MEANS SOMETHING ELSE AND HOLY CHURCH UNDER AN ASPECT HUMAN GABRIEL AND MICHAEL REPRESENT TO YOU AND HIM WHO MADE TOBIAS WHOLE AGAIN THAT WHICH TIMAEUS ARGUES OF THE SOUL
BUT SUCH A SOLID WILL IS ALL TOO RARE AND BY THESE WORDS IF THOU HAST GATHERED THEM AS THOU SHOULDST DO THE ARGUMENT IS REFUTED THAT WOULD HAVE STILL ANNOYED THEE MANY TIMES
BEATRICE DID AS DANIEL HAD DONE RELIEVING NEBUCHADNEZZAR FROM THE WRATH WHICH RENDERED HIM UNJUSTLY MERCILESS AND SAID WELL SEE I HOW ATTRACTETH THEE ONE AND THE OTHER WISH
NE'ER RAN AS THOU WHO THITHERWARD RETURNEST IF OF MY FORMER DOUBT I WAS DIVESTED BY THESE BRIEF LITTLE WORDS MORE SMILED THAN SPOKEN I IN A NEW ONE WAS THE MORE ENSNARED AND SAID
E'ER MADE A LAKE SO WIDELY SPREAD ABROAD THE NEWNESS OF THE SOUND AND THE GREAT LIGHT KINDLED IN ME A LONGING FOR THEIR CAUSE NEVER BEFORE WITH SUCH ACUTENESS FELT WHENCE SHE
WELL I PERCEIVE THAT NEVER SATED IS OUR INTELLECT UNLESS THE TRUTH ILLUME IT BEYOND WHICH NOTHING TRUE EXPANDS ITSELF IT RESTS THEREIN AS WILD BEAST IN HIS LAIR WHEN IT ATTAINS IT
FOR IT IS NEAR THE PRIMAL TRUTH AND THEN THOU FROM PICCARDA MIGHT'ST HAVE HEARD COSTANZA KEPT AFFECTION FOR THE VEIL SO THAT SHE SEEMETH HERE TO CONTRADICT ME MANY TIMES BROTHER HAS IT COME TO PASS THAT TO ESCAPE FROM PERIL
IF ONE FOOD SATES AND FOR ANOTHER STILL REMAINS THE LONGING WE ASK FOR THIS AND THAT DECLINE WITH THANKS E'EN THUS DID I WITH GESTURE AND WITH WORD
SO LIKEWISE THIS INTELLIGENCE DIFFUSES ITS VIRTUE MULTIPLIED AMONG THE STARS ITSELF REVOLVING ON ITS UNITY VIRTUE DIVERSE DOTH A DIVERSE ALLOYAGE MAKE
NOW THOU WILT SAY THE SUNBEAM SHOWS ITSELF MORE DIMLY THERE THAN IN THE OTHER PARTS BY BEING THERE REFLECTED FARTHER BACK
SILENCE IMPOSED UPON MY EAGER MIND THAT HAD ALREADY IN ADVANCE NEW QUESTIONS AND AS AN ARROW THAT UPON THE MARK STRIKES ERE THE BOWSTRING QUIET HATH BECOME SO DID WE SPEED INTO THE SECOND REALM
AND UNITES THE EARTH NOR ONLY THE CREATED THINGS THAT ARE WITHOUT INTELLIGENCE THIS BOW SHOOTS FORTH BUT THOSE THAT HAVE BOTH INTELLECT AND LOVE THE PROVIDENCE THAT REGULATES ALL THIS
BUT BY THAT ONE WHICH CIRCLES FOUR UNITETH WITH THREE CROSSES WITH BETTER COURSE AND WITH A BETTER STAR CONJOINED IT ISSUES AND THE MUNDANE WAX TEMPERS AND STAMPS MORE AFTER ITS OWN FASHION
PERHAPS HIS BOW DOTH HIT UPON SOME TRUTH
EITHER THROUGH AND THROUGH THIS PLANET THUS ATTENUATE WERE OF MATTER OR ELSE AS IN A BODY IS APPORTIONED THE FAT AND LEAN SO IN LIKE MANNER THIS WOULD IN ITS VOLUME INTERCHANGE THE LEAVES
EVEN AS THE SUN THAT DOTH CONCEAL HIMSELF BY TOO MUCH LIGHT
CONTINUED THUS HER HOLY ARGUMENT THE GREATEST GIFT THAT IN HIS LARGESS GOD CREATING MADE AND UNTO HIS OWN GOODNESS NEAREST CONFORMED AND THAT WHICH HE DOTH PRIZE MOST HIGHLY IS THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL
BE FAITHFUL AND NOT BLIND IN DOING THAT AS JEPHTHAH WAS IN HIS FIRST OFFERING WHOM MORE BESEEMED TO SAY I HAVE DONE WRONG THAN TO DO WORSE BY KEEPING
SINCE ONLY THROUGH THE SENSE IT APPREHENDETH
MAKE PEOPLE TELL THAT FABULOUS TALE OF CAIN SOMEWHAT SHE SMILED AND THEN IF THE OPINION OF MORTALS BE ERRONEOUS SHE SAID
THERE MUCH IS LAWFUL WHICH IS HERE UNLAWFUL UNTO OUR POWERS BY VIRTUE OF THE PLACE MADE FOR THE HUMAN SPECIES AS ITS OWN NOT LONG I BORE IT NOR SO LITTLE WHILE BUT
IF WITH ANOTHER SERVICE FOR BROKEN VOW CAN SUCH RETURN BE MADE AS TO SECURE THE SOUL FROM FURTHER CLAIM THIS CANTO THUS DID BEATRICE BEGIN AND AS A MAN WHO BREAKS NOT OFF HIS SPEECH
DOUBT AT THE FOOT OF TRUTH AND THIS IS NATURE WHICH TO THE TOP FROM HEIGHT TO HEIGHT IMPELS US THIS DOTH INVITE ME
NOT BECAUSE ALLOTTED THIS SPHERE HAS BEEN TO THEM BUT TO GIVE SIGN OF THE CELESTIAL WHICH IS LEAST EXALTED
TURNED TOWARDS THESE CAUSE THAT BEHIND THY BACK BE PLACED A LIGHT ILLUMING THE THREE MIRRORS AND COMING BACK TO THEE BY ALL REFLECTED THOUGH IN ITS QUANTITY BE NOT SO AMPLE THE IMAGE MOST REMOTE
WHO SAW ME AS I SAW MYSELF TO QUIET IN ME MY PERTURBED MIND OPENED HER MOUTH ERE I DID MINE TO ASK AND SHE BEGAN THOU MAKEST THYSELF SO DULL
HE OF THE SERAPHIM MOST ABSORBED IN GOD MOSES AND SAMUEL AND WHICHEVER JOHN THOU MAYST SELECT I SAY AND EVEN MARY HAVE NOT IN ANY OTHER HEAVEN THEIR SEATS THAN HAVE THOSE SPIRITS THAT JUST APPEARED TO THEE
BUT NOW ANOTHER PASSAGE RUNS ACROSS BEFORE THINE EYES AND SUCH THAT BY THYSELF THOU COULDST NOT THREAD IT ERE THOU WOULDST BE WEARY I HAVE FOR CERTAIN PUT INTO THY MIND THAT SOUL BEATIFIED COULD NEVER LIE
FULL OF BEATITUDE THE SHADE WAS SEEN BY THE EFFULGENCE CLEAR THAT ISSUED FROM IT THINK READER IF WHAT HERE IS JUST BEGINNING NO FARTHER SHOULD PROCEED
INTO ITSELF DID THE ETERNAL PEARL RECEIVE US EVEN AS WATER DOTH RECEIVE A RAY OF LIGHT REMAINING STILL UNBROKEN IF I WAS BODY
MADONNA AS DEVOUTLY AS MOST I CAN DO I GIVE THANKS TO HIM WHO HAS REMOVED ME FROM THE MORTAL WORLD BUT TELL ME WHAT THE DUSKY SPOTS MAY BE UPON THIS BODY WHICH BELOW ON EARTH
WITH FALSE IMAGINING THAT THOU SEEST NOT WHAT THOU WOULDST SEE IF THOU HADST SHAKEN IT OFF THOU ART NOT UPON EARTH AS THOU BELIEVEST BUT LIGHTNING FLEEING ITS APPROPRIATE SITE
TO FALL INTO MORE HARM HENCE WHEN PICCARDA USES THIS EXPRESSION SHE MEANETH THE WILL ABSOLUTE AND I THE OTHER
AND IT CAN ATTAIN IT IF NOT THEN EACH DESIRE WOULD FRUSTRATE BE
A SACRIFICE IS OF THIS TREASURE MADE SUCH AS I SAY AND MADE BY ITS OWN ACT WHAT CAN BE RENDERED THEN AS COMPENSATION THINK'ST THOU TO MAKE GOOD USE OF WHAT THOU'ST OFFERED
WHO IN SOME PRETTY LITTLE BOAT EAGER TO LISTEN HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING BEHIND MY SHIP THAT SINGING SAILS ALONG TURN BACK TO LOOK AGAIN UPON YOUR SHORES DO NOT PUT OUT TO SEA LEST
AS GIVING THE BELOVED LAUREL ASKS ONE SUMMIT OF PARNASSUS HITHERTO HAS BEEN ENOUGH FOR ME BUT NOW WITH BOTH I NEEDS MUST ENTER THE ARENA LEFT ENTER INTO MY BOSOM THOU
AND IN SUCH SPACE PERCHANCE AS STRIKES A BOLT AND FLIES AND FROM THE NOTCH UNLOCKS ITSELF
AND SHINE IN ONE PART MORE AND IN ANOTHER LESS WITHIN THAT HEAVEN WHICH MOST HIS LIGHT RECEIVES WAS I
AND NOT OF SIN HERETICAL BUT STILL THAT YOUR PERCEPTION MAY BE ABLE TO THOROUGHLY PENETRATE THIS VERITY AS THOU DESIREST I WILL SATISFY THEE
TASTING OF THE HERB THAT MADE HIM PEER OF THE OTHER GODS BENEATH THE SEA TO REPRESENT TRANSHUMANISE IN WORDS IMPOSSIBLE WERE THE EXAMPLE THEN
YE WHO IN THIS PLACE ARE HAPPY ARE YOU DESIROUS OF A HIGHER PLACE TO SEE MORE OR TO MAKE YOURSELVES MORE FRIENDS FIRST WITH THOSE OTHER SHADES SHE SMILED A LITTLE
HER EYES DIRECTED TOW'RDS ME WITH THAT LOOK A MOTHER CASTS ON A DELIRIOUS CHILD AND SHE BEGAN ALL THINGS WHATE'ER THEY BE HAVE ORDER AMONG THEMSELVES AND THIS IS FORM
HENCE IF I HELD MY PEACE MYSELF I BLAME NOT
THAT MY CONFESSION I REMEMBERED NOT SUCH AS THROUGH POLISHED AND TRANSPARENT GLASS OR WATERS CRYSTALLINE AND UNDISTURBED BUT NOT SO DEEP AS THAT THEIR BED BE LOST COME BACK AGAIN THE OUTLINES OF OUR FACES SO FEEBLE
THERE SHALT THOU SEE HOW IT PERFORCE IS EQUALLY RESPLENDENT NOW
I BEHELD IT SPARKLE ROUND ABOUT LIKE IRON THAT COMES MOLTEN FROM THE FIRE AND SUDDENLY IT SEEMED THAT DAY TO DAY WAS ADDED AS IF HE WHO HAS THE POWER HAD WITH ANOTHER SUN THE HEAVEN ADORNED
IF IN THE HEAT OF LOVE I FLAME UPON THEE BEYOND THE MEASURE THAT ON EARTH IS SEEN SO THAT THE VALOUR OF THINE EYES I VANQUISH MARVEL THOU NOT THEREAT FOR THIS PROCEEDS FROM PERFECT SIGHT
AND IF IT CHANCE THE OTHER I DEMOLISH THEN FALSIFIED WILL THY OPINION BE BUT IF THIS RARITY GO NOT THROUGH AND THROUGH THERE NEEDS MUST BE A LIMIT
IF THEIR WILL HAD BEEN PERFECT LIKE TO THAT WHICH LAWRENCE FAST UPON HIS GRIDIRON HELD AND MUTIUS MADE SEVERE TO HIS OWN HAND IT WOULD HAVE URGED THEM BACK ALONG THE ROAD WHENCE THEY WERE DRAGGED AS SOON AS THEY WERE FREE
AND AS FOOLISH THOU THE GREAT LEADER OF THE GREEKS WILT FIND WHENCE WEPT IPHIGENIA HER FAIR FACE AND MADE FOR HER BOTH WISE AND SIMPLE WEEP

LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AND MAKING EACH OTHER'S ACQUAINTANCE THERE WAS A RETIRED COLONEL IN UNIFORM SOME WERE IN FROCK COATS OTHERS IN MORNING COATS AND ONLY ONE WORE A PEASANT'S DRESS
NEKHLUDOFF FLUSHED AND FELT HIS ENERGIES AWAKENING AS THEY ALWAYS DID WHEN HE WAS FACING ANY KIND OF DANGER BUT HIS EXCITEMENT PASSED AT ONCE THE MARECHAL DO NOBLESSE OF THE DISTRICT IN WHICH HIS LARGEST ESTATE LAY
NEKHLUDOFF GAVE HIS NAME AND PASSED INTO THE JURYMEN'S ROOM INSIDE THE ROOM WERE ABOUT TEN PERSONS OF ALL SORTS THEY HAD COME BUT A SHORT WHILE AGO AND SOME WERE SITTING OTHERS WALKING UP AND DOWN
AND THERE MET A WOMAN WITH BRACELETS ON HER BARE PLUMP ARMS AND RINGS ON MOST OF HER FINGERS HEARING THAT KATUSHA WAS BADLY IN WANT OF A PLACE THE WOMAN GAVE HER HER ADDRESS AND INVITED HER TO COME TO HER HOUSE KATUSHA WENT
AND THAT HE WAS HARDLY HER FIRST LOVE THIS LAST IDEA WAS PAINFUL TO HIM HIS PRIDE WOULD NOT RECONCILE ITSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD LOVED SOME ONE ELSE EVEN IN THE PAST
AND TOLD HER THAT THE MAN WAS AN AUTHOR AND THAT HE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND THAT IF HE LIKED HER HE WOULD NOT GRUDGE HER ANYTHING HE DID LIKE HER AND GAVE HER TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES PROMISING TO SEE HER OFTEN
WAS TO NEKHLUDOFF A PROOF OF HER GOOD SENSE AND CORRECT JUDGMENT AGAINST MARRYING MISSY IN PARTICULAR WAS THAT IN ALL LIKELIHOOD A GIRL WITH EVEN HIGHER QUALITIES COULD BE FOUND THAT SHE WAS ALREADY TWENTY SEVEN
WHO HAD STOOD GODMOTHER TO THE GIRL HAD THE KINDER HEART OF THE TWO SISTERS
ENTERED THE ROOM AND SAT DOWN AT ONCE NEAR KATUSHA SMILING AND GAZING AT HER WITH GLISTENING EYES HE BEGAN JOKING WITH HER THE HOSTESS CALLED HIM AWAY INTO THE NEXT ROOM AND KATUSHA HEARD HER SAY A FRESH ONE FROM THE COUNTRY
THOUGH NEKHLUDOFF HAD ARRIVED LATE HE HAD TO WAIT A LONG TIME
THE AIR WAS LADEN WITH THE GERMS OF TYPHOID
HAVING REFRESHED HIS FULL WHITE MUSCULAR BODY AND DRIED IT WITH A ROUGH BATH SHEET HE PUT ON HIS FINE UNDERGARMENTS AND HIS BOOTS AND SAT DOWN BEFORE THE GLASS TO BRUSH HIS BLACK BEARD AND HIS CURLY HAIR
HE PRESSED THE BUTTON OF AN ELECTRIC BELL AND HIS SERVANT AN ELDERLY MOROSE LOOKING MAN WITH WHISKERS AND SHAVED CHIN AND LIP WEARING A GREY COTTON APRON ENTERED AT THE DOOR SEND TO FETCH AN ISVOSTCHIK PLEASE YES SIR
KATUSHA HAD TO LOOK OUT FOR A PLACE AGAIN
FOR HER OWN GOOD AS HE EXPRESSED IT TO THIS LETTER HE HAD AS YET RECEIVED NO ANSWER THIS MIGHT PROVE A GOOD SIGN
WAS NEGLECTED BY ITS MOTHER WHOM IT HINDERED AT HER WORK
BEFORE PROCEEDING TO JOIN HIS REGIMENT
THANKING HER FOR THE INVITATION AND PROMISING TO TRY AND COME TO DINNER HAVING WRITTEN ONE NOTE HE TORE IT UP AS IT SEEMED TOO INTIMATE HE WROTE ANOTHER BUT IT WAS TOO COLD HE FEARED IT MIGHT GIVE OFFENCE SO HE TORE IT UP TOO
YES SIR IT IS NOT VERY POLITE BUT I CAN'T WRITE NO MATTER I SHALL SEE HER TODAY THOUGHT NEKHLUDOFF AND WENT TO GET HIS OVERCOAT WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AN ISVOSTCHIK HE KNEW
THAT JUSTICE FORBIDS PRIVATE LANDHOLDING AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD RESOLUTENESS OF HIS AGE HAD NOT MERELY SPOKEN TO PROVE THAT LAND COULD NOT BE LOOKED UPON AS PRIVATE PROPERTY AND WRITTEN ESSAYS ON THAT SUBJECT AT THE UNIVERSITY
FIVE CHILDREN HAD DIED IN THIS WAY
A MAN AND TWO WOMEN ONE OF THESE WOMEN AS THE CHIEF CRIMINAL TO BE CONDUCTED SEPARATELY
A LIFE WHICH IS LED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN AND WHICH IS NOT MERELY TOLERATED BUT SANCTIONED BY THE GOVERNMENT ANXIOUS FOR THE WELFARE OF ITS SUBJECTS
A WEEK AGO HE HAD WRITTEN HER A DECISIVE LETTER IN WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS GUILT AND HIS READINESS TO ATONE FOR IT
TO HARMONY AND TO LOVE BUT ONLY THEIR OWN DEVICES FOR ENSLAVING ONE ANOTHER THUS IN THE PRISON OFFICE OF THE GOVERNMENT TOWN
HIS MOTHER LAID ALL THE BLAME ON KATUSHA AND GAVE HER NOTICE IT SO HAPPENED THAT AFTER MANY FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS TO FIND A SITUATION KATUSHA AGAIN WENT TO THE REGISTRY OFFICE
TO THE PEASANTS INHERITING HIS MOTHER'S LARGE ESTATES AND THUS BECOMING A LANDED PROPRIETOR HE HAD TO CHOOSE ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER TO GIVE UP HIS PROPERTY AS HE HAD GIVEN UP HIS FATHER'S LAND TEN YEARS BEFORE
THERE HE CAREFULLY CLEANED HIS TEETH MANY OF WHICH WERE FILLED WITH TOOTH POWDER AND RINSED HIS MOUTH WITH SCENTED ELIXIR AFTER THAT HE WASHED HIS HANDS WITH PERFUMED SOAP CLEANED HIS LONG NAILS WITH PARTICULAR CARE
AND MASLOVA STEPPED OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CORRIDOR
WITHOUT BEING PAID HER WAGES
THIS NOTE WAS A CONTINUATION OF THAT SKILFUL MANOEUVRING WHICH THE PRINCESS KORCHAGIN HAD ALREADY PRACTISED FOR TWO MONTHS IN ORDER TO BIND HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER WITH INVISIBLE THREADS AND YET
AND WAS HURT IF HE DID NOT GET IT IN THE JURYMEN'S ROOM HIS FEELINGS WERE HURT BY DISRESPECTFUL TREATMENT AMONG THE JURY THERE HAPPENED TO BE A MAN WHOM HE KNEW A FORMER TEACHER OF HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN PETER GERASIMOVITCH
ANY MORE THAN MOST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT AROSE IN HIS MIND AT THIS TIME IT WAS IN FAVOUR OF MARRIAGE IN GENERAL THAT BESIDES THE COMFORTS OF HEARTH AND HOME IT MADE A MORAL LIFE POSSIBLE AND CHIEFLY THAT A FAMILY WOULD
HIS VULGARITY IN SHORT AH HA YOU'RE ALSO TRAPPED THESE WERE THE WORDS ACCOMPANIED WITH BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER WITH WHICH PETER GERASIMOVITCH GREETED NEKHLUDOFF HAVE YOU NOT MANAGED TO GET OUT OF IT
THAT HAD BEGUN TO GET THIN ABOVE THE FOREHEAD EVERYTHING HE USED EVERYTHING BELONGING TO HIS TOILET HIS LINEN HIS CLOTHES BOOTS NECKTIE PIN
HE COULD NOT PROPOSE AT ONCE IT WAS NOT THAT TEN YEARS PREVIOUSLY HE HAD BETRAYED AND FORSAKEN MASLOVA HE HAD QUITE FORGOTTEN THAT AND HE WOULD NOT HAVE CONSIDERED IT A REASON FOR NOT MARRYING NO THE REASON WAS
HE WAS SAYING THAT IT SEEMED WONDERFUL HOW THE CELEBRATED ADVOCATE HAD MANAGED TO GIVE SUCH A CLEVER TURN TO THE AFFAIR THAT AN OLD LADY THOUGH SHE HAD THE RIGHT ON HER SIDE WOULD HAVE TO PAY A LARGE SUM TO HER OPPONENT
THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE SHARED THE SAME FATE
INFECTED KATUSHA AND HER BABY BOY HAD TO BE SENT TO THE FOUNDLINGS HOSPITAL
AND HE TAKING IT AS HIS DUE AS HE ALWAYS DID WHEN AMONG STRANGERS HAD HE BEEN ASKED WHY HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF ABOVE THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HE COULD NOT HAVE GIVEN AN ANSWER
THEY DESCENDED THE STONE STAIRS
EVEN THE ISVOSTCHIKS KNOW OF MY RELATIONS WITH THE KORCHAGINS THOUGHT NEKHLUDOFF AND AGAIN THE QUESTION WHETHER HE SHOULD NOT MARRY PRINCESS KORCHAGIN PRESENTED ITSELF TO HIM AND HE COULD NOT DECIDE IT EITHER WAY
WERE GONE AS TO THE SECOND COURSE THAT OF DENYING THOSE CLEAR AND UNANSWERABLE PROOFS OF THE INJUSTICE OF LANDHOLDING WHICH HE HAD DRAWN FROM SPENCER'S SOCIAL STATICS
THE OLD MAIDEN LADY SCOLDED THE MAIDS AGAIN
BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES
HE LOOKED AT THE LUXURIOUS FITTINGS OF THE STUDIO WITH A HEAVY HEART AND IT WAS IN NO CHEERFUL MOOD THAT HE ENTERED HIS STUDY A LARGE LOFTY ROOM FITTED UP WITH A VIEW TO COMFORT CONVENIENCE AND ELEGANT APPEARANCE
HE RESOLUTELY RAISED HIS SOLID FRAME AND PUTTING DOWN HIS SMOOTH WHITE LEGS STEPPED INTO HIS SLIPPERS THREW HIS SILK DRESSING GOWN OVER HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND PASSED INTO HIS DRESSING ROOM WALKING HEAVILY AND QUICKLY
FROM INSIDE THE CELL CAME THE SOUND OF BUSTLE AND WOMEN'S VOICES AND THE PATTER OF BARE FEET ON THE FLOOR
WHICH THERE IS THE CIVIL COURT AND THE CRIMINAL COURT I AM ON THE JURY THE CRIMINAL COURT YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID HERE TO THE RIGHT THEN TO THE LEFT THE SECOND DOOR NEKHLUDOFF FOLLOWED THE DIRECTION
TRADESPEOPLE COOKS
AND THE BRILLIANT CORROBORATION OF WHICH HE HAD AT A LATER PERIOD FOUND IN THE WORKS OF HENRY GEORGE
ALL WERE GLAD THE PLANTS THE BIRDS THE INSECTS AND THE CHILDREN BUT MEN GROWN UP MEN AND WOMEN DID NOT LEAVE OFF CHEATING AND TORMENTING THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER
SOPHIA IVANOVNA DRESSED THE LITTLE GIRL IN NICE CLOTHES AND TAUGHT HER TO READ AND WRITE MEANING TO EDUCATE HER LIKE A LADY
OR SILENTLY TO CONFESS THAT ALL HIS FORMER IDEAS WERE MISTAKEN AND FALSE HE COULD NOT CHOOSE THE FORMER BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS BUT THE LANDED ESTATES HE DID NOT CARE TO SERVE
A LACE CAP COVERING THE WIDENING PARTING OF HER HAIR GLIDED INTO THE ROOM THIS WAS AGRAPHENA PETROVNA FORMERLY LADY'S MAID TO NEKHLUDOFF'S MOTHER HER MISTRESS HAD DIED QUITE RECENTLY IN THIS VERY HOUSE
WHILE IT DAILY BECAME MORE DISTASTEFUL TO HIM HAVING SUCCUMBED TO THE TEMPTATION NEKHLUDOFF FELT GUILTY AND HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO BREAK THE TIE WITHOUT HER CONSENT
PASSED HITHER AND THITHER PLAINTIFFS AND THOSE OF THE ACCUSED WHO WERE NOT GUARDED WANDERED SADLY ALONG THE WALLS OR SAT WAITING WHERE IS THE LAW COURT NEKHLUDOFF ASKED OF AN ATTENDANT
BECAUSE NEKHLUDOFF HAD BEEN AN ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRER OF HENRY GEORGE AND HERBERT SPENCER BEING HIMSELF HEIR TO A LARGE PROPERTY HE WAS ESPECIALLY STRUCK BY THE POSITION TAKEN UP BY SPENCER IN SOCIAL STATICS
WHO STOOD WASHING OR IRONING WITH THEIR THIN ARMS IN THE FEARFULLY HOT FRONT ROOM
AND THE SHOPMAN AND ALL THOSE WHO HAD INJURED HER
TURNING HALF ROUND WHEN I DROVE UP AND THE SWISS AT THE DOOR SAYS JUST GONE THE ISVOSTCHIK KNEW THAT NEKHLUDOFF VISITED AT THE KORCHAGINS AND CALLED THERE ON THE CHANCE OF BEING ENGAGED BY HIM
NEKHLUDOFF NEVER KNEW HIS SURNAME AND EVEN BRAGGED A BIT ABOUT THIS THIS MAN WAS NOW A MASTER AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL NEKHLUDOFF COULD NOT STAND HIS FAMILIARITY HIS SELF SATISFIED LAUGHTER
WHICH WAS COVERED WITH A FINE STARCHED CLOTH STOOD A SILVER COFFEEPOT FULL OF AROMATIC COFFEE A SUGAR BASIN A JUG OF FRESH CREAM AND A BREAD BASKET FILLED WITH FRESH ROLLS RUSKS AND BISCUITS
THE UNPRINCIPLED WIFE OF THE MARECHAL DE NOBLESSE OF A DISTRICT WHERE NEKHLUDOFF WAS PRESENT AT AN ELECTION THE DESIRE OF VANQUISHING HIM THIS WOMAN DREW HIM INTO AN INTIMACY WHICH ENTANGLED HIM MORE AND MORE
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT NEKHLUDOFF ASKED A LETTER FROM THE PRINCESS EITHER FROM THE MOTHER OR THE DAUGHTER THE MAID BROUGHT IT SOME TIME AGO AND IS WAITING IN MY ROOM
BOUGHT FROM THE MOST EXPENSIVE DEALERS IN THESE GOODS HE QUITE KNEW WOULD NOT SERVE AS A REASON FOR CLAIMING SUPERIORITY AT THE SAME TIME HE DID CLAIM SUPERIORITY AND ACCEPTED THE RESPECT PAID HIM AS HIS DUE
WELL IT COULD NOT BE WORSE THAN IT IS NOW ANYHOW I ONLY WISH IT WAS SETTLED ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
WROTE ONLY TO LET NEKHLUDOFF KNOW THAT THERE WAS TO BE A SPECIAL MEETING TOWARDS THE END OF MAY AND THAT NEKHLUDOFF WAS TO BE SURE AND COME TO
AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO A SMALL YOUNG WOMAN WITH A VERY FULL BUST CAME BRISKLY OUT OF THE DOOR AND WENT UP TO THE JAILER SHE HAD ON A GREY CLOAK OVER A WHITE JACKET AND PETTICOAT ON HER FEET
AND HAD LOOKED DOWN WITH SOME DISDAIN AT ALL OTHER ACTIVITY FROM THE HEIGHT OF HIS ARTISTIC STANDPOINT AND NOW IT TURNED OUT THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO DO SO AND THEREFORE EVERYTHING THAT REMINDED HIM OF ALL THIS WAS UNPLEASANT
PRINCE DMITRI IVANOVITCH NEKHLUDOFF WHO HAD SEDUCED HER WAS STILL LYING ON HIS HIGH BEDSTEAD WITH A FEATHER BED ON THE TOP OF THE SPRING MATTRESS IN A FINE CLEAN WELL IRONED LINEN NIGHT SHIRT
CALLED OUT MASLOVA TO THE COURT AND CLOSED THE DOOR AGAIN EVEN INTO THE PRISON YARD THE BREEZE HAD BROUGHT THE FRESH VIVIFYING AIR FROM THE FIELDS
THE SIXTH BABY WHOSE FATHER WAS A GIPSY TRAMP WOULD HAVE SHARED THE SAME FATE HAD IT NOT SO HAPPENED THAT ONE OF THE MAIDEN LADIES CAME INTO THE FARMYARD TO SCOLD THE DAIRYMAIDS FOR SENDING UP CREAM THAT SMELT OF THE COW
AGAINST MARRIAGE IN GENERAL WAS THE FEAR COMMON TO BACHELORS PAST THEIR FIRST YOUTH OF LOSING FREEDOM AND AN UNCONSCIOUS AWE BEFORE THIS MYSTERIOUS CREATURE A WOMAN
AT THE IMPORTANT DEBATES CONCERNING THE SCHOOLS AND THE ROADS AS A STRONG OPPOSITION BY THE REACTIONARY PARTY WAS EXPECTED THE MARECHAL WAS A LIBERAL AND WAS QUITE ENGROSSED IN THIS FIGHT
MASLOVA'S MOTHER WAS THE UNMARRIED DAUGHTER OF A VILLAGE WOMAN
HAD EVIDENTLY PARTAKEN OF SOME REFRESHMENTS AND A GLASS OF SOMETHING AND WAS IN MOST PLEASANT SPIRITS THE OTHER WAS A SHOPMAN OF JEWISH EXTRACTION THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PRICE OF WOOL WHEN NEKHLUDOFF CAME UP AND ASKED THEM IF THIS WAS THE JURYMEN'S ROOM
FOR THE TIME OF HER CONFINEMENT WAS DRAWING NEAR
SHE HAD LIVED WITH THE NEKHLUDOFFS FROM THE TIME SHE WAS A CHILD AND HAD KNOWN DMITRI IVANOVITCH AT THE TIME WHEN HE WAS STILL LITTLE MITINKA GOOD MORNING DMITRI IVANOVITCH GOOD MORNING AGRAPHENA PETROVNA
NEKHLUDOFF HAD HEARD THAT THERE WAS SOME OFFICER WHO WAS PAYING HER MARKED ATTENTION AND THIS TORMENTED HIM BY AWAKENING JEALOUSY AND AT THE SAME TIME ENCOURAGED HIM WITH THE HOPE OF ESCAPE FROM THE DECEPTION THAT WAS OPPRESSING HIM
WHOM AGRAPHENA PETROVNA EXPECTED HIM TO MARRY THIS SUPPOSITION OF HERS ANNOYED NEKHLUDOFF THEN I'LL TELL HER TO WAIT AND AGRAPHENA PETROVNA TOOK A CRUMB BRUSH WHICH WAS NOT IN ITS PLACE
THE WOMAN RECEIVED HER VERY KINDLY SET CAKE AND SWEET WINE BEFORE HER THEN WROTE A NOTE AND GAVE IT TO A SERVANT TO TAKE TO SOMEBODY IN THE EVENING A TALL MAN WITH LONG GREY HAIR AND A WHITE BEARD
HANDING HIM THE LETTER WITH A SIGNIFICANT SMILE ALL RIGHT DIRECTLY SAID NEKHLUDOFF TAKING THE LETTER AND FROWNING AS HE NOTICED AGRAPHENA PETROVNA'S SMILE THAT SMILE MEANT THAT THE LETTER WAS FROM THE YOUNGER PRINCESS KORCHAGIN
AND WAS ABOUT TO GO AWAY BUT SEEING THE BABY HER HEART WAS TOUCHED
AND SHE REMAINED WITH THE SON AS HIS HOUSEKEEPER AGRAPHENA PETROVNA HAD SPENT NEARLY TEN YEARS AT DIFFERENT TIMES ABROAD WITH NEKHLUDOFF'S MOTHER AND HAD THE APPEARANCE AND MANNERS OF A LADY
SHE WAS EXACTING SHE PUNISHED AND WHEN IN A BAD TEMPER EVEN STRUCK THE LITTLE GIRL GROWING UP UNDER THESE TWO DIFFERENT INFLUENCES THE GIRL TURNED OUT HALF SERVANT HALF YOUNG LADY
HE GAVE HER ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES AND OFFERED HER A SEPARATE LODGING NEXT DOOR TO THE LODGING RENTED FOR HER BY THE AUTHOR THERE LIVED A JOLLY YOUNG SHOPMAN WITH WHOM KATUSHA SOON FELL IN LOVE SHE TOLD THE AUTHOR
APPEARED IN STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE DULL PALLOR OF HER FACE SHE CARRIED HERSELF VERY STRAIGHT EXPANDING HER FULL BOSOM WITH HER HEAD SLIGHTLY THROWN BACK
THEIR FACES ALL HAD A CERTAIN LOOK OF SATISFACTION AT THE PROSPECT OF FULFILLING A PUBLIC DUTY ALTHOUGH MANY OF THEM HAD HAD TO LEAVE THEIR BUSINESSES AND MOST WERE COMPLAINING OF IT THE JURYMEN TALKED AMONG THEMSELVES ABOUT THE WEATHER
AND BEGAN SPEAKING TO MASLOVA BUT THE JAILER CLOSED THE DOOR PUSHING THE OLD WOMAN'S HEAD WITH IT A WOMAN'S LAUGHTER WAS HEARD FROM THE CELL AND MASLOVA SMILED
A WEALTHY AND ARISTOCRATIC FAMILY WHOSE DAUGHTER EVERY ONE EXPECTED HE WOULD MARRY HE SIGHED AND THROWING AWAY THE END OF HIS CIGARETTE WAS GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER OUT OF THE SILVER CASE BUT CHANGING HIS MIND
THE ELDER A BIG FELLOW WITH MOUSTACHES
YES MY DEAR SIR THIS IS IT ONE OF US ON THE JURY ARE YOU ASKED THE MERCHANT WITH A MERRY WINK
AND ENTERED THE OFFICE WHERE TWO SOLDIERS WERE WAITING TO ESCORT HER
MISSY WHEN NEKHLUDOFF HAD FINISHED HIS COFFEE HE WENT TO HIS STUDY TO LOOK AT THE SUMMONS AND FIND OUT WHAT TIME HE WAS TO APPEAR AT THE COURT BEFORE WRITING HIS ANSWER TO THE PRINCESS PASSING THROUGH HIS STUDIO
I SHALL CONSIDER ALL THAT LATER ON HE SAID TO HIMSELF AS THE TRAP DROVE SILENTLY ALONG THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT UP TO THE DOORS OF THE COURT NOW I MUST FULFIL MY PUBLIC DUTIES CONSCIENTIOUSLY AS I AM IN THE HABIT OF ALWAYS DOING
WHETHER IT WAS TO CONTINUE IN THE SAME WAY AS WHEN HIS MOTHER WAS ALIVE OR WHETHER AS HE HAD REPRESENTED TO THE LATE LAMENTED PRINCESS AND NOW ADVISED THE YOUNG PRINCE THEY HAD NOT BETTER INCREASE THEIR STOCK
THE TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES SOON WENT SOME SHE PAID TO HER AUNT FOR BOARD AND LODGING THE REST WAS SPENT ON A HAT RIBBONS AND SUCH LIKE A FEW DAYS LATER THE AUTHOR SENT FOR HER AND SHE WENT
HER SMALL BROAD HANDS AND FULL NECK WHICH SHOWED FROM UNDER THE BROAD COLLAR OF HER CLOAK WERE OF THE SAME HUE HER BLACK SPARKLING EYES ONE WITH A SLIGHT SQUINT
SHE WORE LINEN STOCKINGS AND PRISON SHOES AND ROUND HER HEAD WAS TIED A WHITE KERCHIEF FROM UNDER WHICH A FEW LOCKS OF BLACK HAIR WERE BRUSHED OVER THE FOREHEAD
IN RUSSIAN AS IN MANY OTHER LANGUAGES THOU IS USED GENERALLY AMONG PEOPLE VERY FAMILIAR WITH EACH OTHER OR BY SUPERIORS TO INFERIORS
AND FARM ALL THE LAND NOW RENTED BY THE PEASANTS THEMSELVES THE STEWARD WROTE THAT THIS WOULD BE A FAR MORE PROFITABLE WAY OF MANAGING THE PROPERTY
AFTER NEKHLUDOFF HAD ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY NAME IS BAKLASHEFF MERCHANT OF THE SECOND GUILD HE SAID PUTTING OUT HIS BROAD SOFT FLEXIBLE HAND WITH WHOM HAVE I THE HONOUR
THEN FROM A TAP FIXED TO HIS MARBLE WASHSTAND HE LET A SPRAY OF COLD WATER RUN OVER HIS FACE AND STOUT NECK HAVING FINISHED THIS PART OF THE BUSINESS HE WENT INTO A THIRD ROOM WHERE A SHOWER BATH STOOD READY FOR HIM
BUT SEEING WHAT A LIFE OF MISERY AND HARDSHIP HER AUNT'S ASSISTANTS LED KATUSHA HESITATED AND APPLIED TO A REGISTRY OFFICE
MANNER OF SPEAKING WALKING LAUGHING FROM THE COMMON PEOPLE NOT BY ANYTHING EXCEPTIONAL BUT BY HER GOOD BREEDING HE COULD FIND NO OTHER TERM FOR THIS QUALITY THOUGH HE PRIZED IT VERY HIGHLY
AND DROVE HER TO THE NOTORIOUS HOUSE KEPT BY CAROLINA ALBERTOVNA KITAEVA FROM THAT DAY A LIFE OF CHRONIC SIN AGAINST HUMAN AND DIVINE LAWS COMMENCED FOR KATUSHA MASLOVA
BESIDE THE USUAL HESITATION OF MEN PAST THEIR YOUTH TO MARRY UNLESS THEY ARE VERY MUCH IN LOVE
THEY CALLED HER KATUSHA WHICH SOUNDS LESS REFINED THAN KATINKA BUT IS NOT QUITE SO COMMON AS KATKA SHE USED TO SEW TIDY UP THE ROOMS
IT FLUTTERED UP AND FLEW CLOSE TO HER EAR FANNING HER WITH ITS WINGS
A TABLE WHICH LOOKED VERY IMPOSING WITH ITS FOUR LEGS CARVED IN THE SHAPE OF LIONS PAWS AND A HUGE SIDE BOARD TO MATCH STOOD IN THE OBLONG ROOM THE FLOOR OF WHICH HAD BEEN POLISHED BY THREE MEN THE DAY BEFORE ON THE TABLE
THIS LETTER WAS PARTLY DISAGREEABLE AND PARTLY PLEASANT IT WAS PLEASANT TO FEEL THAT HE HAD POWER OVER SO LARGE A PROPERTY AND YET DISAGREEABLE
WHERE A FEW STUDIES HUNG ON THE WALLS AND FACING THE EASEL STOOD AN UNFINISHED PICTURE A FEELING OF INABILITY TO ADVANCE IN ART A SENSE OF HIS INCAPACITY CAME OVER HIM HE HAD OFTEN HAD THIS FEELING OF LATE
MEANWHILE SOME OF THE CRIMINAL COURT JURYMEN WHO WERE LATE HAD HURRIEDLY PASSED INTO A SEPARATE ROOM AT THE DOOR MENTIONED TWO MEN STOOD WAITING ONE A TALL FAT MERCHANT A KIND HEARTED FELLOW
THIS UNMARRIED WOMAN HAD A BABY EVERY YEAR AND AS OFTEN HAPPENS AMONG THE VILLAGE PEOPLE
ALSO THE TERRIBLE SCENE HE HAD WITH HER WHEN SHE RAN OUT INTO THE PARK AND IN HER EXCITEMENT TRIED TO DROWN HERSELF IN THE POND
STILL SPRING WAS SPRING EVEN IN THE TOWN THE SUN SHONE WARM THE AIR WAS BALMY
AND EXPLAINED IT BY HIS TOO FINELY DEVELOPED AESTHETIC TASTE STILL THE FEELING WAS A VERY UNPLEASANT ONE SEVEN YEARS BEFORE THIS HE HAD GIVEN UP MILITARY SERVICE FEELING SURE THAT HE HAD A TALENT FOR ART
THE MARECHAL'S WIFE AND FINISH COMPLETELY WITH HER I CAN DO NOTHING HE SAID TO HIMSELF AND THE CONVICTION THAT HE MIGHT AND WAS EVEN OBLIGED TO DELAY HIS DECISION WAS COMFORTING WELL
REEKING OF TOBACCO AND POINTING TO THE PRISONER REMARKED TAKE HER THE SOLDIER
AND SPENT ALL HE COULD LAY HANDS ON AT THE PUBLIC HOUSE
AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE DID NOT FEEL AT LIBERTY TO PROPOSE TO KORCHAGIN EVEN IF HE HAD WISHED TO DO SO AMONG THE LETTERS ON THE TABLE WAS ONE FROM THIS WOMAN'S HUSBAND SEEING HIS WRITING AND THE POSTMARK
WAS OF THE BEST QUALITY VERY QUIET SIMPLE DURABLE AND COSTLY NEKHLUDOFF DRESSED LEISURELY AND WENT INTO THE DINING ROOM
TRIMMED WITH BLACK VELVET WITH LOW NECK AND SHORT SLEEVES CONQUERED HER
THAT HE HAD A LIAISON WITH A MARRIED WOMAN AND THOUGH HE CONSIDERED IT BROKEN OFF SHE DID NOT NEKHLUDOFF WAS RATHER SHY WITH WOMEN AND HIS VERY SHYNESS AWAKENED IN THIS MARRIED WOMAN
IT WAS NOT THIS SPRING MORNING MEN THOUGHT SACRED AND WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION NOT THE BEAUTY OF GOD'S WORLD GIVEN FOR A JOY TO ALL CREATURES THIS BEAUTY WHICH INCLINES THE HEART TO PEACE
AND AFTER GIVING HER A ONE HUNDRED ROUBLE NOTE WENT AWAY FIVE MONTHS LATER
A PEASANT WHO HAD SOLD HIS CHARCOAL AND HAD HAD SOME TEA IN THE TOWN CAME UP AND AFTER CROSSING HIMSELF GAVE HER A COPECK THE PRISONER BLUSHED AND MUTTERED SOMETHING
VELVET SILK SATIN LOW NECKED BALL DRESSES ANYTHING SHE LIKED
THE ATTENDANTS HURRIED OUT OF BREATH DRAGGING THEIR FEET ALONG THE GROUND WITHOUT LIFTING THEM BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH ALL SORTS OF MESSAGES AND PAPERS
STOPPED AND LOOKED CURIOUSLY AT THE PRISONER SOME SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND THOUGHT
I NEVER MEANT TO GET OUT OF IT REPLIED NEKHLUDOFF GLOOMILY AND IN A TONE OF SEVERITY WELL I CALL THIS BEING PUBLIC SPIRITED BUT JUST WAIT UNTIL YOU GET HUNGRY OR SLEEPY YOU'LL SING TO ANOTHER TUNE THEN

THOMASIN CAME OUT OF THE TREE SHOOK FROM HER HAIR AND DRESS THE LOOSE BERRIES WHICH HAD FALLEN THEREON AND WENT DOWN THE HILL WITH HER AUNT EACH WOMAN BEARING HALF THE GATHERED BOUGHS
THAN AN INSECT HE APPEARED AS A MERE PARASITE OF THE HEATH
OF A MILE AND A HALF THIS BROUGHT HER TO A SPOT IN WHICH THE GREEN BOTTOM OF THE DALE BEGAN TO WIDEN
YOU HAVE TIS NEWS TO ME WHILE THE FURZE GATHERERS HAD DESULTORILY CONVERSED THUS EUSTACIA'S FACE GRADUALLY BENT TO THE HEARTH
LIT BY A FEW STRAY MOTES OF LIGHT AS SHE STOOD HALFWAY UP THE LADDER LOOKING AT A SPOT INTO WHICH SHE WAS NOT CLIMBER ENOUGH TO VENTURE NOW A FEW RUSSETS TAMSIN
IT IS THE ONLY WAY OUT OF A FALSE POSITION AND A VERY GALLING ONE WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM THAT HE WAS STANDING IN THE WAY OF ANOTHER LOVER OF YOURS AUNT
YOU MAY THINK WHAT YOU CHOOSE I HAVE NEVER IMPLIED TO YOU BY WORD OR DEED THAT I HAVE GROWN TO THINK OTHERWISE OF HIM AND I NEVER WILL AND I SHALL MARRY HIM WELL WAIT TILL HE REPEATS HIS OFFER
ON THE PRESENT HEATED AFTERNOON WHEN NO PERCEPTIBLE WIND WAS BLOWING THE TREES KEPT UP A PERPETUAL MOAN WHICH ONE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE TO BE CAUSED BY THE AIR
BLOWN DOWN IN THE GALES OF PAST YEARS THE PLACE WAS CALLED THE DEVIL'S BELLOWS AND IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY TO COME THERE ON A MARCH OR NOVEMBER NIGHT TO DISCOVER THE FORCIBLE REASONS FOR THAT NAME
AND HELP CARRY ANYTHING FOR'N THOUGH I SUPPOSE HE'S ALTERED FROM THE BOY HE WAS THEY SAY HE CAN TALK FRENCH AS FAST AS A MAID CAN EAT BLACKBERRIES AND IF SO DEPEND UPON IT WE WHO HAVE STAYED AT HOME
SHE STOPPED A MOMENT DEAR CLYM I WONDER HOW YOUR FACE LOOKS NOW SHE SAID GAZING ABSTRACTEDLY AT THE PIGEON HOLE
AND SET THE SURROUNDING RABBITS CURIOUSLY WATCHING FROM HILLOCKS AT A SAFE DISTANCE THE PERFORMANCE WAS THAT OF BRINGING TOGETHER AND BUILDING INTO A STACK THE FURZE FAGGOTS
SOME IN THE AIR SOME ON THE HOT GROUND AND VEGETATION SOME IN THE TEPID AND STRINGY WATER OF A NEARLY DRIED POOL ALL THE SHALLOWER PONDS HAD DECREASED TO A VAPOROUS MUD
WHERE HE PAUSED AWHILE ON COMING IN HER TURN TO EACH OF THESE SPOTS SHE FOUND HALF A DOZEN LONG LIMP BRAMBLES WHICH HE HAD CUT FROM THE BUSH DURING HIS HALT AND LAID OUT STRAIGHT BESIDE THE PATH
WHY DON'T PEOPLE JUDGE ME BY MY ACTS NOW LOOK AT ME AS I KNEEL HERE PICKING UP THESE APPLES DO I LOOK LIKE A LOST WOMAN I WISH ALL GOOD WOMEN WERE AS GOOD AS I SHE
THUS QUIETLY SHE COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IN THE MORNING THAT HER COLOURLESS INNER WORLD WOULD BEFORE NIGHT BECOME AS ANIMATED AS WATER UNDER A MICROSCOPE AND THAT WITHOUT THE ARRIVAL OF A SINGLE VISITOR
WILL YOU WALK WITH ME TO MEET HIM THIS EVENING I SHOULD LIKE TO ELSE IT WOULD SEEM AS IF I HAD FORGOTTEN HIM SAID THOMASIN TOSSING OUT A BOUGH NOT THAT THAT WOULD MATTER MUCH
SAID HER AUNT WHO STOOD AT THE EDGE OF THE PIT
WHEN CRACKS APPEARED IN CLAYEY GARDENS AND WERE CALLED EARTHQUAKES BY APPREHENSIVE CHILDREN WHEN LOOSE SPOKES WERE DISCOVERED IN THE WHEELS OF CARTS AND CARRIAGES AND WHEN STINGING INSECTS HAUNTED THE AIR
SUDDENLY SHE WAS ATTRACTED TO HIS INDIVIDUALITY BY OBSERVING PECULIARITIES IN HIS WALK IT WAS A GAIT SHE HAD SEEN SOMEWHERE BEFORE AND THE GAIT REVEALED THE MAN TO HER AS THE GAIT OF AHIMAAZ IN THE DISTANT PLAIN
REPLIED THE GIRL HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING AND TEARS SO CROWDED THEMSELVES INTO HER EYES THAT SHE COULD HARDLY DISTINGUISH APPLES FROM FERN AS SHE CONTINUED INDUSTRIOUSLY SEARCHING TO HIDE HER WEAKNESS
MORE SINGULAR STILL THE HEATHMEN HAD INSTINCTIVELY COUPLED HER AND THIS MAN TOGETHER IN THEIR MINDS AS A PAIR BORN FOR EACH OTHER
A STRATUM OF ENSAFFRONED LIGHT WAS IMPOSED ON A STRATUM OF DEEP BLUE AND BEHIND THESE LAY STILL REMOTER SCENES WRAPPED IN FRIGID GREY
HERE SHE SAT FOR TWENTY MINUTES OR MORE ERE SHE COULD SUMMON RESOLUTION TO GO DOWN TO THE DOOR HER COURAGE BEING LOWERED TO ZERO BY HER PHYSICAL LASSITUDE
AS A BLACK SPOT IN THE AIR ABOVE THE CROWN OF THE HILL ON REACHING THIS PLACE MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FELT DISTRESSINGLY AGITATED WEARY AND UNWELL SHE ASCENDED
SHE WENT TOWARDS HIM AND INQUIRED THE WAY THE LABOURER POINTED OUT THE DIRECTION AND ADDED
STRANGERS DON'T SEE YOU AS I DO SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT THEY JUDGE FROM FALSE REPORT WELL IT IS A SILLY JOB AND I AM PARTLY TO BLAME HOW QUICKLY A RASH THING CAN BE DONE
THEY REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE HOLLIES GREW WHICH WAS IN A CONICAL PIT SO THAT THE TOPS OF THE TREES WERE NOT MUCH ABOVE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF THE GROUND THOMASIN STEPPED UP INTO A FORK OF ONE OF THE BUSHES
WHEN SHE BECAME CONSCIOUS OF EXTERNALS IT WAS DUSK THE FURZE RICK WAS FINISHED THE MEN HAD GONE HOME EUSTACIA WENT UPSTAIRS THINKING THAT SHE WOULD TAKE A WALK AT THIS HER USUAL TIME
WAS USED ON EGDON IN PACKING AWAY STORES OF ALL KINDS THE PIGEONS WERE FLYING ABOUT HER HEAD WITH THE GREATEST UNCONCERN AND THE FACE OF HER AUNT WAS JUST VISIBLE ABOVE THE FLOOR OF THE LOFT
SAID THOMASIN WITH ROUND EYES WHAT DO YOU MEAN DON'T BE ALARMED IT WAS MY DUTY
WHAT A NUNNYWATCH WE WERE IN TO BE SURE WHEN WE HEARD THEY WEREN'T MARRIED AT ALL
THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN A HAPPY MEETING IS THERE ANY USE IN SAYING WHAT CAN DO NO GOOD AUNT YES SAID HER AUNT WITH SOME WARMTH TO THOROUGHLY FILL THE AIR WITH THE PAST MISFORTUNE
ON ANY INFINITESIMAL MATTER WHICH CAUGHT HER EYES MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN TO HER SON'S HOUSE AND ITS EXACT POSITION WAS UNKNOWN TO HER
SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE WHAT A CLASS TO BELONG TO DO I REALLY BELONG TO THEM TIS ABSURD YET WHY AUNT DOES EVERYBODY KEEP ON MAKING ME THINK THAT I DO BY THE WAY THEY BEHAVE TOWARDS ME
AT THE TIME THAT EUSTACIA WAS LISTENING TO THE RICK MAKERS CONVERSATION ON CLYM'S RETURN THOMASIN WAS CLIMBING INTO A LOFT OVER HER AUNT'S FUELHOUSE WHERE THE STORE APPLES WERE KEPT
SOUNDS OF VOICES IN CONVERSATION CAME TO HER EARS DIRECTLY DOWN THE CHIMNEY SHE ENTERED THE RECESS AND LISTENING LOOKED UP THE OLD IRREGULAR SHAFT WITH ITS CAVERNOUS HOLLOWS WHERE THE SMOKE BLUNDERED ABOUT
HER AUNT SIMPLY SAID VERY WELL HE SHOULD BY RIGHTS HAVE BEEN TOLD AT THE TIME THAT THE WEDDING WAS GOING TO BE HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR YOUR SECRECY YES HE WILL WHEN HE KNOWS IT WAS BECAUSE I WISHED TO SPARE HIM
TO ANY OTHER PERSON THAN A MOTHER IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED A LITTLE HUMILIATING THAT SHE THE ELDER OF THE TWO WOMEN SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO MAKE ADVANCES BUT MISSUS YEOBRIGHT HAD WELL CONSIDERED ALL THAT AND SHE ONLY THOUGHT
BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF IT HE MUST SOON KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED A MERE LOOK AT YOUR FACE WILL SHOW HIM THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG THOMASIN TURNED AND REGARDED HER AUNT FROM THE TREE
AS A MOTH FRETS A GARMENT ENTIRELY ENGROSSED WITH ITS PRODUCTS HAVING NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING IN THE WORLD BUT FERN FURZE HEATH LICHENS AND MOSS
IT WAS A FINE AND QUIET AFTERNOON ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK BUT THE WINTER SOLSTICE HAVING STEALTHILY COME ON THE LOWNESS OF THE SUN CAUSED THE HOUR TO SEEM LATER THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS
SO THAT OTHER GIRLS MAY TAKE WARNING AND KEEP CLEAR OF IT THOMASIN LOWERED HER FACE TO THE APPLES AGAIN I AM A WARNING TO OTHERS JUST AS THIEVES AND DRUNKARDS AND GAMBLERS ARE
MISSUS YEOBRIGHT STRAINED HER EYES AND AT LAST SAID THAT SHE DID PERCEIVE HIM
HIS PROGRESS WHEN ACTUALLY WALKING WAS MORE RAPID THAN MISSUS YEOBRIGHT'S BUT SHE WAS ENABLED TO KEEP AT AN EQUABLE DISTANCE FROM HIM BY HIS HABIT OF STOPPING WHENEVER HE CAME TO A BRAKE OF BRAMBLES
SHE WAS SCARCELY ABLE TO FAMILIARIZE HERSELF WITH THIS STRANGE REALITY SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT CLYM WAS IN THE HABIT OF CUTTING FURZE BUT SHE HAD SUPPOSED THAT HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF WITH THE LABOUR
AND BE NEITHER DRUNKARD NOR GLUTTON THEY SAY TOO THAT CLYM YEOBRIGHT IS BECOME A REAL PERUSING MAN WITH THE STRANGEST NOTIONS ABOUT THINGS THERE THAT'S BECAUSE HE WENT TO SCHOOL EARLY SUCH AS THE SCHOOL WAS
A SMALL APPLE TREE OF THE SORT CALLED RATHERIPE GREW JUST INSIDE THE GATE THE ONLY ONE WHICH THROVE IN THE GARDEN BY REASON OF THE LIGHTNESS OF THE SOIL AND AMONG THE FALLEN APPLES ON THE GROUND BENEATH
ENTER HIS OWN DOOR AT ONE SIDE OF CLYM'S HOUSE WAS A KNOLL AND ON THE TOP OF THE KNOLL A CLUMP OF FIR TREES SO HIGHLY THRUST UP INTO THE SKY THAT THEIR FOLIAGE FROM A DISTANCE APPEARED
AS TO GET HOME AGAIN SO SHE WENT ON THE AIR AROUND HER PULSATING SILENTLY AND OPPRESSING THE EARTH WITH LASSITUDE SHE LOOKED AT THE SKY OVERHEAD
SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT QUIETLY FIXING HER EYE UPON HER NIECE
AT WHICH MYRIADS OF IMPRISONED SHAPES AROSE WHERE HAD PREVIOUSLY APPEARED THE STILLNESS OF A VOID
AND THAT I DID NOT EXPECT HIM HOME SO SOON AND YOU MUST NOT LET ME STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR CHRISTMAS PARTY PUTTING IT OFF WOULD ONLY MAKE MATTERS WORSE OF COURSE I SHALL NOT I DO NOT WISH TO SHOW MYSELF BEATEN BEFORE ALL EGDON
IS THE VERY THING THAT WILL HINDER THE TALE FROM REACHING HIM EARLY IF I AM NOT MADE SAFE FROM SNEERS IN A WEEK OR TWO I WILL TELL HIM MYSELF THE EARNESTNESS WITH WHICH THOMASIN SPOKE PREVENTED FURTHER OBJECTIONS
CERTAIN EPHEMERAL OPERATIONS WERE APT TO DISTURB IN THEIR TRIFLING WAY THE MAJESTIC CALM OF EGDON HEATH THEY WERE ACTIVITIES WHICH BESIDE THOSE OF A TOWN A VILLAGE OR EVEN A FARM
SHE TRIED ONE ASCENDING PATH AND ANOTHER AND FOUND THAT THEY LED HER ASTRAY RETRACING HER STEPS SHE CAME AGAIN TO AN OPEN LEVEL WHERE SHE PERCEIVED AT A DISTANCE A MAN AT WORK
HOW BEST TO MAKE HER VISIT APPEAR TO EUSTACIA NOT ABJECT BUT WISE FROM HER ELEVATED POSITION THE EXHAUSTED WOMAN COULD PERCEIVE THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE BELOW AND THE GARDEN
AS IT OFTEN APPEARS ON A FINE WINTER DAY IN DISTINCT PLANES OF ILLUMINATION INDEPENDENTLY TONED THE RAYS WHICH LIT THE NEARER TRACTS OF LANDSCAPE
THOMASIN WAS PERFORCE CONTENT AND YOU WILL KEEP THE SECRET OF MY WOULD BE MARRIAGE FROM CLYM FOR THE PRESENT SHE NEXT ASKED
LET HIM BUT SINCE HE LOVED ME ONCE WE WILL NOT PAIN HIM BY TELLING HIM MY TROUBLE TOO SOON THE AIR IS FULL OF THE STORY I KNOW BUT GOSSIPS WILL NOT DARE TO SPEAK OF IT TO HIM FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS HIS CLOSENESS TO ME
SHALL SEEM NO MORE THAN SCROFF IN HIS EYES
I THINK HE MAY DO IT NOW THAT HE KNOWS SOMETHING I TOLD HIM I DON'T FOR A MOMENT DISPUTE THAT IT IS THE MOST PROPER THING FOR YOU TO MARRY HIM MUCH AS I HAVE OBJECTED TO HIM IN BYGONE DAYS I AGREE WITH YOU NOW YOU MAY BE SURE
NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME BETTER THAN TO SEE THEM TWO MAN AND WIFE THEY'D LOOK VERY NATTY ARM IN CROOK TOGETHER AND THEIR BEST CLOTHES ON WHETHER OR NO
WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CHAP TERRIBLE MUCH AFTER SO MANY YEARS
ANY MORE THAN I AM AN IMPROPER WOMAN HE HAS AN UNFORTUNATE MANNER AND DOESN'T TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE HIM IF THEY DON'T WISH TO DO IT OF THEIR OWN ACCORD THOMASIN
COME DOWN AND WE'LL GO FOR THE HOLLY THERE IS NOBODY ON THE HEATH THIS AFTERNOON AND YOU NEED NOT FEAR BEING STARED AT WE MUST GET SOME BERRIES OR CLYM WILL NEVER BELIEVE IN OUR PREPARATIONS
WHICH HUMPHREY HAD BEEN CUTTING FOR THE CAPTAIN'S USE DURING THE FOREGOING FINE DAYS THE STACK WAS AT THE END OF THE DWELLING AND THE MEN ENGAGED IN BUILDING IT WERE HUMPHREY AND SAM THE OLD MAN LOOKING ON
THAT WEAK GIRL HOW IS SHE GOING TO GET A MAN TO MARRY HER WHEN SHE CHOOSES BUT LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING AUNT
I BELONG TO ONE MAN NOTHING CAN ALTER THAT
ONE TIDINGS OF THE COMER
THOMASIN CAME DOWN WHEN THE APPLES WERE COLLECTED AND TOGETHER THEY WENT THROUGH THE WHITE PALINGS TO THE HEATH BEYOND THE OPEN HILLS WERE AIRY AND CLEAR AND THE REMOTE ATMOSPHERE APPEARED
AND THINKING THE REGULATION THOUGHTS TO JUDGE BY HIS MOTIONS PLANNING A DOZEN HASTY SCHEMES FOR AT ONCE PRESERVING HIM AND EUSTACIA FROM THIS MODE OF LIFE SHE THROBBINGLY FOLLOWED THE WAY AND SAW HIM
THE LEAVES OF THE HOLLYHOCKS HUNG LIKE HALF CLOSED UMBRELLAS THE SAP ALMOST SIMMERED IN THE STEMS AND FOLIAGE WITH A SMOOTH SURFACE GLARED LIKE METALLIC MIRRORS
AND NOT THAT OF A PERSON COME ON BUSINESS OR BY INVITATION HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE WITH INTEREST AND THEN WALKED ROUND AND SCANNED THE OUTER BOUNDARY OF THE GARDEN AS ONE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD IT BEEN THE BIRTHPLACE OF SHAKESPEARE
WHICH ADMITTED THE SUNLIGHT SO DIRECTLY UPON HER BROWN HAIR AND TRANSPARENT TISSUES THAT IT ALMOST SEEMED TO SHINE THROUGH HER IF HE COULD HAVE BEEN DEAR TO YOU IN ANOTHER WAY SAID MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FROM THE LADDER
WHENEVER IT PREVAILED SOME WERE BLASTED AND SPLIT AS IF BY LIGHTNING BLACK STAINS AS FROM FIRE MARKING THEIR SIDES WHILE THE GROUND AT THEIR FEET WAS STREWN WITH DEAD FIR NEEDLES AND HEAPS OF CONES
YES SIR THAT'S IT TIS A BLAZING GREAT BUSINESS THAT HE BELONGS TO SO I'VE HEARD HIS MOTHER SAY
AND THEY TELL ME TIS WHERE THE KING'S HEAD WAS CUT OFF YEARS AGO MY POOR MOTHER USED TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT BUSINESS HUMMY SHE USED TO SAY I WAS A YOUNG MAID THEN
A YOUNG AND CLEVER MAN WAS COMING INTO THAT LONELY HEATH FROM OF ALL CONTRASTING PLACES IN THE WORLD PARIS
NOW HEARKEN TO ME SHE SAID HER DELICATE VOICE EXPANDING INTO FIRMNESS BY A FORCE WHICH WAS OTHER THAN PHYSICAL TELL HIM NOTHING
AND THAT YOU ACT A PART TO ME HE WISHED TO MARRY ME
EUSTACIA WAS INDOORS IN THE DINING ROOM WHICH WAS REALLY MORE LIKE A KITCHEN HAVING A STONE FLOOR AND A GAPING CHIMNEY CORNER THE AIR WAS STILL AND WHILE SHE LINGERED A MOMENT HERE ALONE
WOULD HAVE APPEARED AS THE FERMENT OF STAGNATION MERELY A CREEPING OF THE FLESH OF SOMNOLENCE BUT HERE AWAY FROM COMPARISONS SHUT IN BY THE STABLE HILLS AMONG WHICH MERE WALKING
BUT THE PRESENT TORRID ATTACK MADE THE JOURNEY A HEAVY UNDERTAKING FOR A WOMAN PAST MIDDLE AGE AND AT THE END OF THE THIRD MILE SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD HIRED FAIRWAY TO DRIVE HER A PORTION AT LEAST OF THE DISTANCE
STRANGE NOTIONS HAS HE SAID THE OLD MAN AH THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THAT SENDING TO SCHOOL IN THESE DAYS IT ONLY DOES HARM
EVEN STRONGER AND MORE ACTIVE THAN HER OWN THE TREES BENEATH WHICH SHE SAT WERE SINGULARLY BATTERED RUDE AND WILD AND FOR A FEW MINUTES MISSUS YEOBRIGHT DISMISSED THOUGHTS OF HER OWN STORM BROKEN
THEIR FATHERS COULDN'T DO IT AND THE COUNTRY WAS ALL THE BETTER FOR IT NOW I SHOULD THINK CAP'N THAT MISS EUSTACIA HAD ABOUT AS MUCH IN HER HEAD THAT COMES FROM BOOKS AS ANYBODY ABOUT HERE
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THESE NEW MOVES IN FAMILIES MY FATHER WAS A SAILOR SO WAS I AND SO SHOULD MY SON HAVE BEEN IF I HAD HAD ONE THE PLACE HE'S BEEN LIVING AT IS PARIS SAID HUMPHREY
THEY'VE CUT THE KING'S HEAD OFF JANE AND WHAT TWILL BE NEXT GOD KNOWS A GOOD MANY OF US KNEW AS WELL AS HE BEFORE LONG SAID THE CAPTAIN CHUCKLING I LIVED SEVEN YEARS UNDER WATER ON ACCOUNT OF IT IN MY BOYHOOD
THE JOURNEY ACROSS THE HEATH THURSDAY THE THIRTY FIRST OF AUGUST WAS ONE OF A SERIES OF DAYS DURING WHICH SNUG HOUSES WERE STIFLING AND WHEN COOL DRAUGHTS WERE TREATS
AND BY AN INSTINCTIVE IMPULSE OF LOYALTY TOWARDS HER COUSIN CLYM TO BESTIR HERSELF ON HIS ACCOUNT WITH AN ALACRITY UNUSUAL IN HER DURING THESE MOST SORROWFUL DAYS OF HER LIFE
AND EXHAUSTED STATE TO CONTEMPLATE THEIRS NOT A BOUGH IN THE NINE TREES WHICH COMPOSED THE GROUP BUT WAS SPLINTERED LOPPED AND DISTORTED BY THE FIERCE WEATHER THAT THERE HELD THEM AT ITS MERCY
THAT'S A BAD TROUBLE ABOUT HIS COUSIN THOMASIN
HAD UNDERGONE A SPECIES OF INCINERATION SINCE THE DROUGHT HAD SET IN
AS SHE HAD DONE UNDER HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ON MANY SIMILAR OCCASIONS AND WITH A SMALL CHOPPER THAT THEY HAD BROUGHT SHE BEGAN TO LOP OFF THE HEAVILY BERRIED BOUGHS DON'T SCRATCH YOUR FACE
CLYM'S FAMILY IS AS GOOD AS HERS
SAID THE CAPTAIN SHORTLY AFTER WHICH HE WALKED AWAY I SAY SAM OBSERVED HUMPHREY WHEN THE OLD MAN WAS GONE
TILL THEY WERE DIMINISHED TO AN ISOLATED ONE HERE AND THERE BY THE INCREASING FERTILITY OF THE SOIL
I CAN WELL MIND WHEN HE LEFT HOME SAID SAM TIS A GOOD THING FOR THE FELLER SAID HUMPHREY
TO SEARCH OUT THE BEST AND LARGEST OF THEM FOR THE COMING HOLIDAY TIME THE LOFT WAS LIGHTED BY A SEMICIRCULAR HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE PIGEONS CREPT TO THEIR LODGINGS IN THE SAME HIGH QUARTERS OF THE PREMISES
IN CONFORMITY WITH HER WORDS TO THE REDDLEMAN SHE HAD HOPED TO BE WELL ADVANCED IN HER WALK BEFORE THE HEAT OF THE DAY WAS AT ITS HIGHEST BUT AFTER SETTING OUT SHE FOUND THAT THIS WAS NOT TO BE DONE
A WOMAN CAN HARDLY PASS FOR SHAME SOMETIMES
AND SHE DETERMINED THAT HER WALK SHOULD BE IN THE DIRECTION OF BLOOMS END THE BIRTHPLACE OF YOUNG YEOBRIGHT AND THE PRESENT HOME OF HIS MOTHER SHE HAD NO REASON FOR WALKING ELSEWHERE AND
IN A PROFOUND REVERIE HER TOE UNCONSCIOUSLY TAPPING THE DRY TURF WHICH LAY BURNING AT HER FEET
ONLY AT ODD TIMES BY WAY OF USEFUL PASTIME YET SHE NOW BEHELD HIM AS A FURZE CUTTER AND NOTHING MORE WEARING THE REGULATION DRESS OF THE CRAFT
WHICH MARKED THE VERGE OF THE HEATH IN THIS LATITUDE THEY SHOWED UPON THE DUSKY SCENE THAT THEY BORDERED AS DISTINCTLY AS WHITE LACE ON VELVET BEHIND THE WHITE PALINGS WAS A LITTLE GARDEN BEHIND THE GARDEN
THE FURZE STACK WAS NOT FAR FROM THE CHIMNEY AND THE VOICES WERE THOSE OF THE WORKERS HER GRANDFATHER JOINED IN THE CONVERSATION
AN OLD IRREGULAR THATCHED HOUSE FACING THE HEATH AND COMMANDING A FULL VIEW OF THE VALLEY THIS WAS THE OBSCURE REMOVED SPOT TO WHICH WAS ABOUT TO RETURN A MAN WHOSE LATTER LIFE
SUNRISE HAD ADVANCED ITS QUARTERS FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHEAST SUNSET HAD RECEDED FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHWEST BUT EGDON HAD HARDLY HEEDED THE CHANGE
EVEN THE PURPLE HEATH FLOWERS HAVING PUT ON A BROWNNESS UNDER THE DRY BLAZES OF THE FEW PRECEDING DAYS EVERY VALLEY WAS FILLED WITH AIR LIKE THAT OF A KILN
AND THE WHOLE ENCLOSURE OF THE LITTLE DOMICILE AND NOW AT THE MOMENT OF RISING SHE SAW A SECOND MAN APPROACHING THE GATE HIS MANNER WAS PECULIAR HESITATING
THE FURZE CUTTER WAS SO ABSORBED IN THE BUSINESS OF HIS JOURNEY THAT HE NEVER TURNED HIS HEAD AND HIS LEATHER LEGGED AND GAUNTLETED FORM AT LENGTH BECAME TO HER AS NOTHING MORE THAN A MOVING HANDPOST TO SHOW HER THE WAY
THERE BEING LITTLE HERE TO REMIND AN INHABITANT THAT HE MUST UNLEARN HIS SUMMER EXPERIENCE OF THE SKY AS A DIAL IN THE COURSE OF MANY DAYS AND WEEKS
IT WAS NOW NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE SUNLIGHT WAS LEAVING THE VALES WHEN THE WEST GREW RED THE TWO RELATIVES CAME AGAIN FROM THE HOUSE AND PLUNGED INTO THE HEATH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM THE FIRST
ALL THAT AFTERNOON THE EXPECTED ARRIVAL OF THE SUBJECT OF EUSTACIA'S RUMINATIONS CREATED A BUSTLE OF PREPARATION AT BLOOMS END THOMASIN HAD BEEN PERSUADED BY HER AUNT
HAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
AND ALSO WITH RESPECT TO ITS MOMENTS OF DESPERATION ON ACCOUNT OF NOTHING SUITING US IT IS IN VAIN TO GET OURSELVES UP AS ROMANTIC OR CLASSICAL OR CHRISTIAN
EX NIHILO FOR IT HAS ITS PROPER CAUSES THE UNFORESEEN AND UNEXPECTED CONCURRENCE OF WHICH HAS BROUGHT THE CHANCE ABOUT FOR HAD NOT THE CULTIVATOR BEEN DIGGING
OR FLORENTINE OR BAROCCO OR NATIONAL IN MORIBUS ET ARTIBUS IT DOES NOT CLOTHE US BUT THE SPIRIT ESPECIALLY THE
IS PRECISELY THE SPIRITUALISING OF JUSTICE
AND ALL SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH DEAL ONLY WITH THESE ARE NAIVETES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX
FOR INSTANCE IF A MAN IS DIGGING THE EARTH FOR TILLAGE AND FINDS A MASS OF BURIED GOLD NOW SUCH A FIND IS REGARDED AS ACCIDENTAL YET IT IS NOT
NOT FROM ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE DISCOVERER SINCE NEITHER HE WHO BURIED THE GOLD NOR HE WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD INTENDED THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE FOUND BUT AS I SAID IT HAPPENED
APPLIES TO THAT WHICH HAS TO BE FASHIONED BRUISED FORGED STRETCHED ROASTED ANNEALED REFINED
THEY WILL SAY THEIR HONESTY' THAT IS THEIR DEVILRY AND NOTHING ELSE WHAT DOES IT MATTER AND EVEN IF THEY WERE RIGHT HAVE NOT ALL GODS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH SANCTIFIED
INEVITABLE ENGLISH UTILITARIANS HOW PONDEROUSLY AND RESPECTABLY THEY STALK ON STALK ALONG A HOMERIC METAPHOR EXPRESSES IT BETTER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BENTHAM
A DISSATISFACTION WITH ITS OWN CONDITION OR AN ADMIRATION OF WHAT IS STRANGE ALL THIS DETERMINES AND DISPOSES THEM UNFAVOURABLY EVEN TOWARDS THE BEST THINGS OF THE WORLD WHICH ARE NOT THEIR PROPERTY
IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S ART AND TASTE LIVES AS PERHAPS ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES WHERE WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE WE GO OUR WAY ENCHANTED AND VOLUNTARILY
WHAT PLACE CAN BE LEFT FOR RANDOM ACTION WHEN GOD CONSTRAINETH ALL THINGS TO ORDER FOR EX NIHILO NIHIL IS SOUND DOCTRINE WHICH NONE OF THE ANCIENTS GAINSAID
WE ARE PREPARED AS NO OTHER AGE HAS EVER BEEN FOR A CARNIVAL IN THE GRAND STYLE FOR THE MOST SPIRITUAL FESTIVAL LAUGHTER AND ARROGANCE FOR THE TRANSCENDENTAL HEIGHT OF SUPREME FOLLY
SHE CEASED AND WAS ABOUT TO PASS ON IN HER DISCOURSE TO THE EXPOSITION OF OTHER MATTERS WHEN I BREAK IN AND SAY EXCELLENT IS THINE EXHORTATION AND SUCH AS WELL BESEEMETH THY HIGH AUTHORITY
THAT I HONOUR AND RESPECT AN UNSELFISH MAN NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS UNSELFISH BUT BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE USEFUL TO ANOTHER MAN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE IN SHORT THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS
DEEP AND WIDE ALL THE FLOTSAM COMES TOGETHER THAT IS BORNE UPON THE TIDE SHIPS AND TRUNKS OF TREES UPROOTED IN THE TORRENT'S WILD CAREER MEET AS MID THE SWIRLING WATERS
AND IS THERE ANYTHING FINER THAN TO SEARCH FOR ONE'S OWN VIRTUES IS IT NOT ALMOST TO BELIEVE IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES BUT THIS BELIEVING IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES
THE DIVINING INSTINCT FOR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THESE VALUATIONS FOR THE RELATION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE VALUATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE OPERATING FORCES THIS HISTORICAL SENSE
CREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED IN MAN THERE IS NOT ONLY MATTER SHRED EXCESS CLAY MIRE FOLLY CHAOS BUT THERE IS ALSO THE CREATOR
OUR ITCHING IS REALLY THE ITCHING FOR THE INFINITE THE IMMEASURABLE LIKE THE RIDER ON HIS FORWARD PANTING HORSE WE LET THE REINS FALL BEFORE THE INFINITE WE MODERN MEN WE SEMI BARBARIANS
SO WE MODERN MEN OWING TO THE COMPLICATED MECHANISM OF OUR FIRMAMENT ARE DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT MORALITIES
NO NEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A FINER TURNING OR BETTER EXPRESSION OF AN OLD THOUGHT NOT EVEN A PROPER HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATURE
GRADATIONS OF RANK IN THE WORLD EVEN AMONG THINGS AND NOT ONLY AMONG MEN
MALICE SPIRITUALISES THEY ARE GLAD IN THEIR INMOST HEART THAT THERE IS A STANDARD ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO ARE OVER ENDOWED WITH INTELLECTUAL GOODS AND PRIVILEGES ARE EQUAL TO THEM
JUST AS THOUGH IN SHORT THEY BETRAY SOMETHING THEREBY FLAUBERT FOR INSTANCE
THE HISTORICAL SENSE OR THE CAPACITY FOR DIVINING QUICKLY THE ORDER OF RANK OF THE VALUATIONS ACCORDING TO WHICH A PEOPLE A COMMUNITY OR AN INDIVIDUAL HAS LIVED
IS OPPOSED TO OUR TASTE NOWADAYS THIS IS ALSO AN ADVANCE AS IT WAS AN ADVANCE IN OUR FATHERS THAT RELIGION AS AN ATTITUDE FINALLY BECAME OPPOSED TO THEIR TASTE INCLUDING THE ENMITY
THE HYBRID EUROPEAN A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN TAKEN ALL IN ALL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A COSTUME HE NEEDS HISTORY AS A STOREROOM OF COSTUMES
OUR STUPIDITY EVERY VIRTUE INCLINES TO STUPIDITY EVERY STUPIDITY TO VIRTUE STUPID TO THE POINT OF SANCTITY THEY SAY IN RUSSIA LET US BE CAREFUL LEST
NOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS
AND ALSO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM US WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE FIRSTLINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY OUR MULTIFARIOUSNESS AND ART OF DISGUISING
I SHALL TAKE CARE NOT TO SAY SO I WOULD RATHER FLATTER THEM WITH MY THEORY THAT LOFTY SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIES
WE ENJOY HOMER ONCE MORE IT IS PERHAPS OUR HAPPIEST ACQUISITION THAT WE KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE HOMER WHOM MEN OF DISTINGUISHED CULTURE
IT WILL BE DIFFERENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN AS IN THE STELLAR FIRMAMENT THERE ARE SOMETIMES TWO SUNS WHICH DETERMINE THE PATH OF ONE PLANET
I WOULD NOW RECOMMEND FOR A CHANGE SOMETHING ELSE FOR A PLEASURE NAMELY THE UNCONSCIOUS ASTUTENESS WITH WHICH GOOD FAT HONEST MEDIOCRITY ALWAYS BEHAVES TOWARDS LOFTIER SPIRITS
HONESTY GRANTING THAT IT IS THE VIRTUE OF WHICH WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES WE FREE SPIRITS WELL WE WILL LABOUR AT IT WITH ALL OUR PERVERSITY AND LOVE
AS THEY SHINE HERE AND THERE THOSE MOMENTS AND MARVELOUS EXPERIENCES WHEN A GREAT POWER HAS VOLUNTARILY COME TO A HALT BEFORE THE BOUNDLESS AND INFINITE WHEN A SUPER ABUNDANCE OF REFINED DELIGHT HAS BEEN ENJOYED
LET US BE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BEING CREDITED WITH MORAL TACT AND SUBTLETY IN MORAL DISCERNMENT THEY NEVER FORGIVE US IF THEY HAVE ONCE MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE US
IN WHICH WE HAVE TO FEAR AND LOVE THIS ALMOST INVISIBLE INAUDIBLE WORLD OF DELICATE COMMAND AND DELICATE OBEDIENCE A WORLD OF ALMOST IN EVERY RESPECT CAPTIOUS INSIDIOUS SHARP
THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF WHICH ARE ALREADY SPECIFIED DOCUMENTARILY IN A THOUGHTFUL LETTER OF GALIANI TO MADAME D'EPINAY IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF THE MAN OF MODERN IDEAS
WHO STRIVE AFTER POWER THEY CALL IT FREEDOM OUR SYMPATHY IS A LOFTIER AND FURTHER SIGHTED SYMPATHY WE SEE HOW MAN DWARFS HIMSELF HOW YOU DWARF HIM
CHAPTER SEVEN OUR VIRTUES
AND MAKES HIS DESTRUCTION DESIRABLE THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING OF GREAT SUFFERING KNOW YE NOT THAT IT IS ONLY THIS DISCIPLINE THAT HAS PRODUCED ALL THE ELEVATIONS OF HUMANITY HITHERTO
OUR VIRTUES IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE TOO HAVE STILL OUR VIRTUES ALTHOUGH NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT THOSE SINCERE AND MASSIVE VIRTUES ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH WE HOLD OUR GRANDFATHERS IN ESTEEM
TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THE PRACTICE OF JUDGING AND CONDEMNING MORALLY IS THE FAVOURITE REVENGE OF THE INTELLECTUALLY SHALLOW ON THOSE WHO ARE LESS SO
HAS BEEN MORE INJURED BY THE TEDIOUSNESS OF ITS ADVOCATES THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER I WOULD NOT WISH TO OVERLOOK THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS
OR THE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER NO THE HAPPINESS OF ENGLAND WILL BE BEST SERVED THEREBY THEY WOULD LIKE BY ALL MEANS TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT THE STRIVING AFTER ENGLISH HAPPINESS
JUST AS HE HAD ALREADY STALKED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE RESPECTABLE HELVETIUS NO HE WAS NOT A DANGEROUS MAN HELVETIUS C E SENATEUR POCOCURANTE TO USE AN EXPRESSION OF GALIANI
WITH OUR MOST ARDENT REQUIREMENTS WELL THEN LET US LOOK FOR THEM IN OUR LABYRINTHS WHERE AS WE KNOW SO MANY THINGS LOSE THEMSELVES SO MANY THINGS GET QUITE LOST
FOR THEY GET THE BETTER EVEN OF THEIR BLUNDERS
AND ARISTOPHANIC RIDICULE OF THE WORLD PERHAPS WE ARE STILL DISCOVERING THE DOMAIN OF OUR INVENTION JUST HERE THE DOMAIN WHERE EVEN WE CAN STILL BE ORIGINAL
INDEED AT TIMES THE HIGHER AND SUBLIMER THING TAKES PLACE WE LEARN TO DESPISE WHEN WE LOVE AND PRECISELY WHEN WE LOVE BEST ALL OF IT HOWEVER UNCONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT NOISE
SO IT IS SYMPATHY AGAINST SYMPATHY BUT TO REPEAT IT ONCE MORE THERE ARE HIGHER PROBLEMS THAN THE PROBLEMS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN AND SYMPATHY
I MEAN AFTER COMFORT AND FASHION
ESPRIT VASTE AND EVEN VOLTAIRE THE LAST ECHO OF THE CENTURY CANNOT AND COULD NOT SO EASILY APPROPRIATE WHOM THEY SCARCELY PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO ENJOY THE VERY DECIDED YEA
THE HISTORICAL SENSE IMPLIES ALMOST THE SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR EVERYTHING THE TASTE AND TONGUE FOR EVERYTHING WHEREBY IT IMMEDIATELY PROVES ITSELF TO BE AN IGNOBLE SENSE FOR INSTANCE
THAT IS ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE PLAUSIBLE MODES OF THOUGHT AND NAIVETES WHICH EVERY ONE CONSCIOUS OF CREATIVE POWERS AND AN ARTIST'S CONSCIENCE
WHO COULD GIVE THIS POPULAR ASTONISHMENT A SEDUCTIVE AND MYSTICAL OTHER WORLDLY EXPRESSION PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW THE HIGHER NATURE BY EXPERIENCE INSTEAD OF STATING
THE TENSION OF SOUL IN MISFORTUNE WHICH COMMUNICATES TO IT ITS ENERGY ITS SHUDDERING IN VIEW OF RACK AND RUIN ITS INVENTIVENESS AND BRAVERY IN UNDERGOING ENDURING
NOW WITH RED LIGHT NOW WITH GREEN
SUBTLER EVEN THAN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS VICTIMS A REPEATED PROOF THAT INSTINCT IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF ALL KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN DISCOVERED
BUT LET US NOT BE AFRAID THINGS STILL REMAIN TODAY AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN I SEE NO ONE IN EUROPE WHO HAS OR DISCLOSES AN IDEA OF THE FACT THAT PHILOSOPHIZING CONCERNING MORALS
AND TO EVERY FORM OF SEMI BARBARITY THAT HAS AT ANY TIME EXISTED ON EARTH AND IN SO FAR AS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION HITHERTO HAS JUST BEEN SEMI BARBARITY
SO IT SEEMS TO ME EVERY SYSTEM OF UNEGOISTIC MORALITY WHICH TAKES ITSELF UNCONDITIONALLY AND APPEALS TO EVERY ONE NOT ONLY SINS AGAINST GOOD TASTE
BY COINCIDENCE THAT ONE DUG WHERE THE OTHER BURIED THE TREASURE WE MAY THEN DEFINE CHANCE AS BEING AN UNEXPECTED RESULT FLOWING FROM A CONCURRENCE OF CAUSES WHERE THE SEVERAL FACTORS HAD SOME DEFINITE END
FOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLING
AND TENDER YES IT IS WELL PROTECTED FROM CLUMSY SPECTATORS AND FAMILIAR CURIOSITY WE ARE WOVEN INTO A STRONG NET AND GARMENT OF DUTIES AND CANNOT DISENGAGE OURSELVES
FELLOW SUFFERING IS PREACHED NOWADAYS AND IF I GATHER RIGHTLY NO OTHER RELIGION IS ANY LONGER PREACHED LET THE PSYCHOLOGIST HAVE HIS EARS OPEN THROUGH ALL THE VANITY THROUGH ALL THE NOISE WHICH IS NATURAL TO THESE PREACHERS
OUR GOOD ARISTOTLE SAYS SHE HAS DEFINED IT CONCISELY IN HIS PHYSICS AND CLOSELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRUTH HOW PRAY SAID I
AS ITS SIXTH SENSE OWING TO THIS MINGLING THE PAST OF EVERY FORM AND MODE OF LIFE AND OF CULTURES WHICH WERE FORMERLY CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS AND SUPERIMPOSED ON ONE ANOTHER FLOWS FORTH INTO US
AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS GENERALLY WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERN ORDINARY MEN INCLUDING THE CULTURED EVEN THE LEARNED AND PERHAPS PHILOSOPHERS ALSO IF APPEARANCES DO NOT DECEIVE
THE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MAN
IT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLE
AND ARE SELDOM UNEQUIVOCAL AND THERE ARE OFTEN CASES ALSO IN WHICH OUR ACTIONS ARE MOTLEY COLOURED
BUT IS ALSO AN INCENTIVE TO SINS OF OMISSION AN ADDITIONAL SEDUCTION UNDER THE MASK OF PHILANTHROPY AND PRECISELY A SEDUCTION AND INJURY TO THE HIGHER RARER AND MORE PRIVILEGED TYPES OF MEN
BUT THE MEETING AND CONCURRENCE OF THESE CAUSES ARISES FROM THAT INEVITABLE CHAIN OF ORDER WHICH FLOWING FROM THE FOUNTAIN HEAD OF PROVIDENCE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IN THEIR DUE TIME AND PLACE
EVEN AN ACTION FOR LOVE'S SAKE SHALL BE UNEGOISTIC BUT YOU FOOLS AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER BUT WHOEVER HAS REALLY OFFERED SACRIFICE KNOWS
THE CASE IS NOT DIFFERENT WITH SHAKESPEARE THAT MARVELOUS SPANISH MOORISH SAXON SYNTHESIS OF TASTE OVER WHOM AN ANCIENT ATHENIAN
WITH A SECRET CONFIDENCE AND CORDIALITY WE ENJOY IT AS A REFINEMENT OF ART RESERVED EXPRESSLY FOR US AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE AS LITTLE DISTURBED BY THE REPULSIVE FUMES AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE ENGLISH POPULACE
SOON TO DRAW APART AND PLAINWARD EACH ITS SEPARATE WAY TO WEND WHEN ONCE MORE THEIR WATERS MINGLE IN A CHANNEL
LET US GO WITH ALL OUR DEVILS TO THE HELP OF OUR GOD IT IS PROBABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL MISUNDERSTAND AND MISTAKE US ON THAT ACCOUNT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
TO BE SURE HE NOTICES THAT NONE OF THE COSTUMES FIT HIM PROPERLY HE CHANGES AND CHANGES LET US LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THESE HASTY PREFERENCES AND CHANGES IN ITS MASQUERADES OF STYLE
PRECISELY HERE WE ARE MEN OF DUTY EVEN WE OCCASIONALLY IT IS TRUE WE DANCE IN OUR CHAINS AND BETWIXT OUR SWORDS
THAT HE WANTED AND OBTAINED SOMETHING FOR IT PERHAPS SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF THAT HE RELINQUISHED HERE IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE THERE PERHAPS IN GENERAL TO BE MORE
AS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURY
PROBABLY AS PARODISTS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY AND AS GOD'S MERRY ANDREWS PERHAPS THOUGH NOTHING ELSE OF THE PRESENT HAVE A FUTURE OUR LAUGHTER ITSELF MAY HAVE A FUTURE
HAD NOT THE MAN WHO HID THE MONEY BURIED IT IN THAT PRECISE SPOT THE GOLD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND THESE THEN ARE THE REASONS WHY THE FIND IS A CHANCE ONE IN THAT IT RESULTS FROM CAUSES WHICH MET TOGETHER AND CONCURRED
DID HE PERHAPS DESERVE TO BE LAUGHED AT WHEN HE THUS EXHORTED SYSTEMS OF MORALS TO PRACTISE MORALITY BUT ONE SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH IN THE RIGHT
AND VOLTAIREAN BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION AND ALL THAT FORMERLY BELONGED TO FREETHINKER PANTOMIME IT IS THE MUSIC IN OUR CONSCIENCE THE DANCE IN OUR SPIRIT TO WHICH PURITAN LITANIES
THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY THAT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS PROPER FOR ANOTHER SO SAID MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMME
BY MEANS OF OUR SEMI BARBARITY IN BODY AND IN DESIRE WE HAVE SECRET ACCESS EVERYWHERE SUCH AS A NOBLE AGE NEVER HAD WE HAVE ACCESS ABOVE ALL TO THE LABYRINTH OF IMPERFECT CIVILIZATIONS
IS MORALIZING NOT IMMORAL IN THE END THEY ALL WANT ENGLISH MORALITY TO BE RECOGNIZED AS AUTHORITATIVE INASMUCH AS MANKIND OR THE GENERAL UTILITY
AT LEAST TO THE VERY BAD TASTE AND WE CAN ONLY EVOKE IN OURSELVES IMPERFECTLY HESITATINGLY AND WITH COMPULSION THE SMALL SHORT AND HAPPY GODSENDS AND GLORIFICATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE
AND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHT
AND WHO THE OTHER IS FOR INSTANCE IN A PERSON CREATED AND DESTINED FOR COMMAND SELF DENIAL AND MODEST RETIREMENT INSTEAD OF BEING VIRTUES WOULD BE THE WASTE OF VIRTUES
OR COULD NOT BECOME THEIR PREY AND NO FACULTY IS MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO SUCH MEN THAN JUST THIS HISTORICAL SENSE WITH ITS TRUCKLING PLEBEIAN CURIOSITY
MORAL SERMONS AND GOODY GOODNESS WON'T CHIME
IT IS DESIRABLE THAT AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD REFLECT UPON MORALS AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS VERY DESIRABLE THAT MORALS SHOULD NOT SOME DAY BECOME INTERESTING
LET US FINALLY CONFESS IT THAT WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR US MEN OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE TO GRASP FEEL TASTE AND LOVE WHAT FINDS US FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILE
HISTORICAL SPIRIT PROFITS EVEN BY THIS DESPERATION ONCE AND AGAIN A NEW SAMPLE OF THE PAST OR OF THE FOREIGN IS TESTED PUT ON TAKEN OFF PACKED UP AND ABOVE ALL STUDIED
IS PRECISELY THE PERFECTION AND ULTIMATE MATURITY IN EVERY CULTURE AND ART THE ESSENTIALLY NOBLE IN WORKS AND MEN THEIR MOMENT OF SMOOTH SEA AND HALCYON SELF SUFFICIENCY
THE FACT THEREBY BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT THE GREATER PART OF WHAT INTERESTS AND CHARMS HIGHER NATURES AND MORE REFINED AND FASTIDIOUS TASTES SEEMS ABSOLUTELY UNINTERESTING TO THE AVERAGE MAN IF
THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
THESE ARE MEN WITHOUT DUTY WE HAVE ALWAYS FOOLS AND APPEARANCES AGAINST US
WHETHER IT BE HEDONISM PESSIMISM UTILITARIANISM OR EUDAEMONISM ALL THOSE MODES OF THINKING WHICH MEASURE THE WORTH OF THINGS ACCORDING TO PLEASURE AND PAIN
IS NOT A MORALIST THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN THAT IS TO SAY AS A THINKER WHO REGARDS MORALITY AS QUESTIONABLE AS WORTHY OF INTERROGATION IN SHORT AS A PROBLEM
HAS COME TO US IN THE TRAIN OF THE ENCHANTING AND MAD SEMI BARBARITY INTO WHICH EUROPE HAS BEEN PLUNGED BY THE DEMOCRATIC MINGLING OF CLASSES AND RACES IT IS ONLY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT HAS RECOGNIZED THIS FACULTY
AT ALL AND IF SO WHAT IT IS THEN SHE MADE ANSWER I AM ANXIOUS TO FULFIL MY PROMISE COMPLETELY AND OPEN TO THEE A WAY OF RETURN TO THY NATIVE LAND
ALTHOUGH THEY USED IT OF MATERIAL SUBSTANCE NOT OF THE EFFICIENT PRINCIPLE THIS THEY LAID DOWN AS A KIND OF BASIS FOR ALL THEIR REASONINGS CONCERNING NATURE NOW
MORAL SYSTEMS MUST BE COMPELLED FIRST OF ALL TO BOW BEFORE THE GRADATIONS OF RANK THEIR PRESUMPTION MUST BE DRIVEN HOME TO THEIR CONSCIENCE UNTIL THEY THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AT LAST
JIM LOOKED EVERY DAY OVER THE THICKETS OF GARDENS BEYOND THE ROOFS OF THE TOWN OVER THE FRONDS OF PALMS GROWING ON THE SHORE AT THAT ROADSTEAD WHICH IS A THOROUGHFARE TO THE EAST AT THE ROADSTEAD DOTTED BY GARLANDED ISLETS
HE LAY THERE BATTENED DOWN IN THE MIDST OF A SMALL DEVASTATION AND FELT SECRETLY GLAD HE HAD NOT TO GO ON DECK BUT NOW AND AGAIN AN UNCONTROLLABLE RUSH OF ANGUISH WOULD GRIP HIM BODILY
LIKE A PRISONER ALONE IN HIS CELL OR LIKE A WAYFARER LOST IN A WILDERNESS AT PRESENT HE WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT DID NOT MATTER THOUGH THEY HAD A PURPOSE BUT HE DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD EVER AGAIN SPEAK OUT AS LONG AS HE LIVED
LIGHTED BY FESTAL SUNSHINE ITS SHIPS LIKE TOYS ITS BRILLIANT ACTIVITY RESEMBLING A HOLIDAY PAGEANT WITH THE ETERNAL SERENITY OF THE EASTERN SKY OVERHEAD AND THE SMILING PEACE OF THE EASTERN SEAS
BUT I KNEW THE TRUTH AND I WOULD LIVE IT DOWN ALONE WITH MYSELF I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE IN TO SUCH A BEASTLY UNFAIR THING WHAT DID IT PROVE AFTER ALL I WAS CONFOUNDEDLY CUT UP SICK OF LIFE
THE MISTS WERE CLOSING AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD I APPEARED TO HIM AND HOW MUCH WISE NOT HALF AS OLD AS I FELT JUST THEN NOT HALF AS USELESSLY WISE AS I KNEW MYSELF TO BE
CLEAN SHAVED AND IMPASSIBLE LOOKED AT HIM DEADLY PALE BETWEEN THE RED FACES OF THE TWO NAUTICAL ASSESSORS THE LIGHT OF A BROAD WINDOW UNDER THE CEILING FELL FROM ABOVE ON THE HEADS AND SHOULDERS OF THE THREE MEN
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR A FELLOW IN MY POSITION TO BE BELIEVED MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TO AN ELDER MAN IT IS SO DIFFICULT SO AWFULLY UNFAIR SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
THERE ARE MANY SHADES IN THE DANGER OF ADVENTURES AND GALES AND IT IS ONLY NOW AND THEN THAT THERE APPEARS ON THE FACE OF FACTS A SINISTER VIOLENCE OF INTENTION THAT INDEFINABLE SOMETHING WHICH FORCES IT UPON THE MIND AND THE HEART OF A MAN
HARBOURED A SILENT LISTENER NOW AND THEN A SMALL RED GLOW WOULD MOVE ABRUPTLY AND EXPANDING LIGHT UP THE FINGERS OF A LANGUID HAND PART OF A FACE IN PROFOUND REPOSE OR FLASH A CRIMSON GLEAM INTO A PAIR OF PENSIVE EYES
LIKE THIS HE SAID IT DOES ME GOOD YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO ME YOU DON'T WORDS SEEMED TO FAIL HIM IT WAS A DISTINCT GLIMPSE HE WAS A YOUNGSTER OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO SEE ABOUT YOU
HELD ON HER STEADFAST WAY BLACK AND SMOULDERING IN A LUMINOUS IMMENSITY AS IF SCORCHED BY A FLAME FLICKED AT HER FROM A HEAVEN WITHOUT PITY
OVERSHADOWED BY A FRAGMENT OF AN UNRUFFLED FOREHEAD AND WITH THE VERY FIRST WORD UTTERED MARLOW'S BODY EXTENDED AT REST IN THE SEAT WOULD BECOME VERY STILL AS THOUGH HIS SPIRIT HAD WINGED ITS WAY BACK INTO THE LAPSE OF TIME
AND FORTUNATELY HE REMEMBERED EVERYTHING HE WANTED TO GO ON TALKING FOR TRUTH'S SAKE PERHAPS FOR HIS OWN SAKE ALSO AND WHILE HIS UTTERANCE WAS DELIBERATE HIS MIND POSITIVELY FLEW ROUND AND ROUND THE SERRIED CIRCLE OF FACTS
OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO IMAGINE YOURSELF TO HAVE BEEN OF THE SORT WHOSE APPEARANCE CLAIMS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THESE ILLUSIONS YOU HAD THOUGHT GONE OUT EXTINCT COLD AND WHICH AS IF REKINDLED AT THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER FLAME
FELT A SHIVER RUN DOWN HIS BACK THE BIG ASSESSOR HAD DROPPED HIS EYELIDS AND DRUMMED ON WITHOUT A SOUND CARELESS AND MOURNFUL THE EYES OF THE OTHER ABOVE THE SUNBURNT CLASPED FINGERS
HE KNEW THE MAGIC MONOTONY OF EXISTENCE BETWEEN SKY AND WATER HE HAD TO BEAR THE CRITICISM OF MEN THE EXACTIONS OF THE SEA AND THE PROSAIC SEVERITY OF THE DAILY TASK THAT GIVES BREAD BUT WHOSE ONLY REWARD IS IN THE PERFECT LOVE OF THE WORK
I INTERJECTED I WOULD HAVE MEANT TO BE HE RETORTED AND THAT'S MORE THAN I MEANT WHEN I HE SHIVERED AS IF ABOUT TO SWALLOW SOME NAUSEOUS DRUG JUMPED
WHICH WAS ON THE PORT SIDE HE MOANED AS HE RAN HE SPOKE SLOWLY HE REMEMBERED SWIFTLY AND WITH EXTREME VIVIDNESS HE COULD HAVE REPRODUCED LIKE AN ECHO THE MOANING OF THE ENGINEER FOR THE BETTER INFORMATION OF THESE MEN
HE SAID SPEAKING OF THE SHIP SHE WENT OVER WHATEVER IT WAS AS EASY AS A SNAKE CRAWLING OVER A STICK THE ILLUSTRATION WAS GOOD THE QUESTIONS WERE AIMING AT FACTS
THE MAGISTRATE HAD SWAYED FORWARD
THE TIMID WOMEN MUFFLED UP AND CLASPING TO THEIR BREASTS WRAPPED IN LOOSE ENDS OF SOILED HEAD CLOTHS THEIR SLEEPING BABIES THE UNCONSCIOUS PILGRIMS OF AN EXACTING BELIEF
HE DID NOT STRIKE HIM AGAIN HE STOOD BENDING OVER HIM AND SPEAKING ANGRILY BUT QUITE LOW
HIS LAMENESS HOWEVER PERSISTED AND WHEN THE SHIP ARRIVED AT AN EASTERN PORT HE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL HIS RECOVERY WAS SLOW AND HE WAS LEFT BEHIND
NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I DIDN'T AFTER ALL DIDN'T GO OUT IN THAT WAY I WASN'T GOING TO BE FRIGHTENED AT WHAT I HAD DONE AND ANYHOW IF I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP I WOULD HAVE DONE MY BEST TO BE SAVED
SUCH WERE THE DAYS STILL HOT HEAVY DISAPPEARING ONE BY ONE INTO THE PAST AS IF FALLING INTO AN ABYSS FOR EVER OPEN IN THE WAKE OF THE SHIP AND THE SHIP LONELY UNDER A WISP OF SMOKE
AND TORMENTED AS IF AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS OF UNREST HE DID NOT CARE WHAT THE END WOULD BE AND IN HIS LUCID MOMENTS OVERVALUED HIS INDIFFERENCE THE DANGER WHEN NOT SEEN HAS THE IMPERFECT VAGUENESS OF HUMAN THOUGHT
RESTED UPON A WHITE MAN WHO SAT APART FROM THE OTHERS WITH HIS FACE WORN AND CLOUDED BUT WITH QUIET EYES THAT GLANCED STRAIGHT INTERESTED AND CLEAR JIM ANSWERED ANOTHER QUESTION AND WAS TEMPTED TO CRY OUT
SAID THE GERMAN SKIPPER TO HIS NEW CHIEF MATE AN ARAB THE LEADER OF THAT PIOUS VOYAGE CAME LAST HE WALKED SLOWLY ABOARD HANDSOME AND GRAVE IN HIS WHITE GOWN AND LARGE TURBAN A STRING OF SERVANTS FOLLOWED LOADED WITH HIS LUGGAGE
HOW THIS ONE HAD AN EASY BILLET IN JAPAN SOMEWHERE AND THAT ONE WAS DOING WELL IN THE SIAMESE NAVY AND IN ALL THEY SAID IN THEIR ACTIONS IN THEIR LOOKS IN THEIR PERSONS COULD BE DETECTED THE SOFT SPOT THE PLACE OF DECAY
SHE WAS OWNED BY A CHINAMAN CHARTERED BY AN ARAB AND COMMANDED BY A SORT OF RENEGADE NEW SOUTH WALES GERMAN VERY ANXIOUS TO CURSE PUBLICLY HIS NATIVE COUNTRY BUT WHO APPARENTLY ON THE STRENGTH OF BISMARCK'S VICTORIOUS POLICY
THE BIG FRAMEWORK OF PUNKAHS MOVED GENTLY TO AND FRO HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND FROM BELOW MANY EYES WERE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF DARK FACES OUT OF WHITE FACES OUT OF RED FACES OUT OF FACES ATTENTIVE SPELLBOUND
AS IF ALL THESE PEOPLE SITTING IN ORDERLY ROWS UPON NARROW BENCHES HAD BEEN ENSLAVED BY THE FASCINATION OF HIS VOICE IT WAS VERY LOUD IT RANG STARTLING IN HIS OWN EARS IT WAS THE ONLY SOUND AUDIBLE IN THE WORLD
THE STRONG MEN AT THE HEAD OF FAMILY PARTIES THE LEAN OLD MEN PRESSING FORWARD WITHOUT HOPE OF RETURN YOUNG BOYS WITH FEARLESS EYES GLANCING CURIOUSLY SHY LITTLE GIRLS WITH TUMBLED LONG HAIR
OUTSIDE THE COURT THE SUN BLAZED WITHIN WAS THE WIND OF GREAT PUNKAHS THAT MADE YOU SHIVER THE SHAME THAT MADE YOU BURN THE ATTENTIVE EYES WHOSE GLANCE STABBED THE FACE OF THE PRESIDING MAGISTRATE
HE PRONOUNCED WITH A CONVULSIVE EFFORT WHOSE STRESS AS IF PROPAGATED BY THE WAVES OF THE AIR MADE MY BODY STIR A LITTLE IN THE CHAIR HE FIXED ME WITH LOWERING EYES DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME HE CRIED I SWEAR
AT HIS BACK WAS THE DARK NIGHT WITH THE CLEAR STARS WHOSE DISTANT GLITTER DISPOSED IN RETREATING PLANES LURED THE EYE INTO THE DEPTHS OF A GREATER DARKNESS
HEAVY PROD GETS HOME THE BOND IS FOUND TO BE CLOSE THAT BESIDES THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CRAFT THERE IS FELT THE STRENGTH OF A WIDER FEELING THE FEELING THAT BINDS A MAN TO A CHILD HE WAS THERE BEFORE ME BELIEVING THAT
THAT THIS COMPLICATION OF ACCIDENTS OR THESE ELEMENTAL FURIES ARE COMING AT HIM WITH A PURPOSE OF MALICE WITH A STRENGTH BEYOND CONTROL WITH AN UNBRIDLED CRUELTY THAT MEANS TO TEAR OUT OF HIM HIS HOPE AND HIS FEAR
AND ON THE SECRET PURPOSES OF THEIR HEARTS THE STEAMER POUNDED IN THE DUSK THE CALM WATER OF THE STRAIT AND FAR ASTERN OF THE PILGRIM SHIP A SCREW PILE LIGHTHOUSE PLANTED BY UNBELIEVERS ON A TREACHEROUS SHOAL SEEMED TO WINK AT HER
LIKE WATER FLOWING INTO CREVICES AND CRANNIES LIKE WATER RISING SILENTLY EVEN WITH THE RIM EIGHT HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN WITH FAITH AND HOPES WITH AFFECTIONS AND MEMORIES THEY HAD COLLECTED THERE
HOW MUCH MORE DID YOU WANT I ASKED BUT I THINK I SPOKE SO LOW THAT HE DID NOT CATCH WHAT I SAID HE HAD ADVANCED HIS ARGUMENT AS THOUGH LIFE HAD BEEN A NETWORK OF
PERDITION THAT DWELT WITHIN LIKE A MALEVOLENT SOUL IN A DETESTABLE BODY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE THIS CLEAR THIS HAD NOT BEEN A COMMON AFFAIR EVERYTHING IN IT HAD BEEN OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
THE SOUND OF HIS OWN TRUTHFUL STATEMENTS CONFIRMED HIS DELIBERATE OPINION THAT SPEECH WAS OF NO USE TO HIM ANY LONGER THAT MAN THERE SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF HIS HOPELESS DIFFICULTY JIM LOOKED AT HIM THEN TURNED AWAY
THE AWNINGS COVERED THE DECK WITH A WHITE ROOF FROM STEM TO STERN AND A FAINT HUM A LOW MURMUR OF SAD VOICES ALONE REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF A CROWD OF PEOPLE UPON THE GREAT BLAZE OF THE OCEAN
AND YET A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT SEEMED TO SHOW ME HIS BOYISH HEAD AS IF IN THAT MOMENT THE YOUTH WITHIN HIM HAD FOR A MOMENT GLOWED AND EXPIRED YOU ARE AN AWFUL GOOD SORT TO LISTEN
AND THE OFFICIAL INQUIRY WAS BEING HELD IN THE POLICE COURT OF AN EASTERN PORT HE STOOD ELEVATED IN THE WITNESS BOX WITH BURNING CHEEKS IN A COOL LOFTY ROOM
HIS FINGERS PLAYED INCESSANTLY TOUCHING THE PAPER WITHOUT NOISE I DID NOT THINK OF DANGER JUST THEN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE STARTLED ALL THIS HAPPENED IN SUCH A QUIET WAY AND SO VERY SUDDENLY
THE EDGE OF HIS TEMPER AND THE FIBRE OF HIS STUFF THAT REVEAL THE QUALITY OF HIS RESISTANCE AND THE SECRET TRUTH OF HIS PRETENCES NOT ONLY TO OTHERS BUT ALSO TO HIMSELF
WHO WANTED FACTS AFTER HIS FIRST FEELING OF REVOLT HE HAD COME ROUND TO THE VIEW THAT ONLY A METICULOUS PRECISION OF STATEMENT WOULD BRING OUT THE TRUE HORROR BEHIND THE APPALLING FACE OF THINGS
AND AUDIBLY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AFTER DINNER ON A VERANDAH DRAPED IN MOTIONLESS FOLIAGE AND CROWNED WITH FLOWERS IN THE DEEP DUSK SPECKLED BY FIERY CIGAR ENDS THE ELONGATED BULK OF EACH CANE CHAIR
AS IF FACTS COULD EXPLAIN ANYTHING AFTER YOU HAD CONCLUDED YOU HAD COLLIDED WITH SOMETHING FLOATING AWASH SAY A WATER LOGGED WRECK YOU WERE ORDERED BY YOUR CAPTAIN TO GO FORWARD AND ASCERTAIN IF THERE WAS ANY DAMAGE DONE
AND WAS PLACATED BY THE SOUND OF A FAINT SIGH THAT PASSED BETWEEN US LIKE THE FLIGHT OF A BIRD IN THE NIGHT WELL I WASN'T HE SAID COURAGEOUSLY IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRETCHED STORY THEY MADE UP IT WAS NOT A LIE
BRUTALISED ALL THOSE HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF AND WORE A BLOOD AND IRON AIR COMBINED WITH A PURPLE NOSE AND A RED MOUSTACHE AFTER SHE HAD BEEN PAINTED OUTSIDE AND WHITEWASHED INSIDE EIGHT HUNDRED PILGRIMS MORE OR LESS
STOP THE ENGINES INSTEAD OF MAKING A ROW ABOUT IT ON DECK I HEARD HIM SAY GET UP RUN FLY HE SWORE ALSO THE ENGINEER SLID DOWN THE STARBOARD LADDER AND BOLTED ROUND THE SKYLIGHT TO THE ENGINE ROOM COMPANION
WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THIS WHAT'S THE GOOD HE TAPPED WITH HIS FOOT SLIGHTLY BIT HIS LIP AND LOOKED AWAY OVER THE HEADS HE MET THE EYES OF THE WHITE MAN THE GLANCE DIRECTED AT HIM WAS NOT THE FASCINATED STARE OF THE OTHERS
I WANTED IT IT IS THE VERY THING I WANTED THERE DO YOU THINK YOU OR ANYBODY COULD HAVE MADE ME IF I I AM I AM NOT AFRAID TO TELL AND I WASN'T AFRAID TO THINK EITHER I LOOKED IT IN THE FACE
COMING FROM NORTH AND SOUTH AND FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE EAST AFTER TREADING THE JUNGLE PATHS DESCENDING THE RIVERS COASTING IN PRAUS ALONG THE SHALLOWS CROSSING IN SMALL CANOES FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND PASSING THROUGH SUFFERING
MEETING STRANGE SIGHTS BESET BY STRANGE FEARS UPHELD BY ONE DESIRE THEY CAME FROM SOLITARY HUTS IN THE WILDERNESS FROM POPULOUS CAMPONGS FROM VILLAGES BY THE SEA AT THE CALL OF AN IDEA
WITHOUT A RIPPLE WITHOUT A WRINKLE VISCOUS STAGNANT DEAD THE PATNA WITH A SLIGHT HISS PASSED OVER THAT PLAIN LUMINOUS AND SMOOTH UNROLLED A BLACK RIBBON OF SMOKE ACROSS THE SKY
THE SUNSHINE THE MEMORIES THE FUTURE WHICH MEANS TO SWEEP THE WHOLE PRECIOUS WORLD UTTERLY AWAY FROM HIS SIGHT BY THE SIMPLE AND APPALLING ACT OF TAKING HIS LIFE JIM
THE FACTS THOSE MEN WERE SO EAGER TO KNOW HAD BEEN VISIBLE TANGIBLE OPEN TO THE SENSES OCCUPYING THEIR PLACE IN SPACE AND TIME REQUIRING FOR THEIR EXISTENCE A FOURTEEN HUNDRED TON STEAMER
HE REPEATED AND I WONDERED AT THE EVIDENT BUT OBSCURE INTENTION WELL YES PERHAPS I COULD NOT SEE THEN BUT I HAD PLENTY OF TIME AND ANY AMOUNT OF LIGHT IN THAT BOAT AND I COULD THINK TOO
THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FORESTS THEIR CLEARINGS THE PROTECTION OF THEIR RULERS THEIR PROSPERITY THEIR POVERTY THE SURROUNDINGS OF THEIR YOUTH AND THE GRAVES OF THEIR FATHERS THEY CAME COVERED WITH DUST WITH SWEAT WITH GRIME WITH RAGS
HE ASSOCIATED NATURALLY WITH THE MEN OF HIS CALLING IN THE PORT THESE WERE OF TWO KINDS SOME VERY FEW AND SEEN THERE BUT SELDOM LED MYSTERIOUS LIVES
LOOKING AT JIM WITH THOUGHTFUL BLUE EYES THE OTHER A HEAVY SCORNFUL MAN THROWN BACK IN HIS SEAT HIS LEFT ARM EXTENDED FULL LENGTH DRUMMED DELICATELY WITH HIS FINGER TIPS ON A BLOTTING PAD IN THE MIDDLE THE MAGISTRATE
HE RESTED HIS TEMPLE IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THE WIND OF THE PUNKAHS EDDIED DOWN ON THE HEADS ON THE DARK FACED NATIVES WOUND ABOUT IN VOLUMINOUS DRAPERIES ON THE EUROPEANS SITTING TOGETHER VERY HOT
AFFLICTED BY SOME MYSTERIOUS TROPICAL DISEASE WHO HELD THE DOCTOR FOR AN ASS AND INDULGED IN SECRET DEBAUCHERIES OF PATENT MEDICINE WHICH HIS TAMIL SERVANT USED TO SMUGGLE IN WITH UNWEARIED DEVOTION THEY TOLD EACH OTHER THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES
HAD REMAINED AS OFFICERS OF COUNTRY SHIPS THEY HAD NOW A HORROR OF THE HOME SERVICE WITH ITS HARDER CONDITIONS SEVERER VIEW OF DUTY AND THE HAZARD OF STORMY OCEANS THEY WERE ATTUNED TO THE ETERNAL PEACE OF EASTERN SKY AND SEA
TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HIS LEFT ARM WAS BROKEN HE HAD SLIPPED ON THE TOP STEP WHEN GETTING DOWN WHILE I WAS FORWARD HE EXCLAIMED MY GOD THAT ROTTEN BULKHEAD'LL GIVE WAY IN A MINUTE
HADN'T WE ALL COMMENCED WITH THE SAME DESIRE ENDED WITH THE SAME KNOWLEDGE CARRIED THE MEMORY OF THE SAME CHERISHED GLAMOUR THROUGH THE SORDID DAYS OF IMPRECATION WHAT WONDER THAT WHEN SOME
CHAPTER TWO AFTER TWO YEARS OF TRAINING HE WENT TO SEA AND ENTERING THE REGIONS SO WELL KNOWN TO HIS IMAGINATION FOUND THEM STRANGELY BARREN OF ADVENTURE HE MADE MANY VOYAGES
GLIDED PAST ON HIS DESCENT AND SANK MYSTERIOUSLY INTO THE SEA EVENING AFTER EVENING PRESERVING THE SAME DISTANCE AHEAD OF HER ADVANCING BOWS THE FIVE WHITES ON BOARD LIVED AMIDSHIPS ISOLATED FROM THE HUMAN CARGO
HE HAD COME ACROSS THAT MAN BEFORE IN THE STREET PERHAPS HE WAS POSITIVE HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM FOR DAYS FOR MANY DAYS HE HAD SPOKEN TO NO ONE BUT HAD HELD SILENT INCOHERENT AND ENDLESS CONVERSE WITH HIMSELF
PLAYED CARDS A LITTLE OR YAWNING AND IN PYJAMAS LOUNGED THROUGH THE DAY IN EASY CHAIRS WITHOUT SAYING A WORD THE HOSPITAL STOOD ON A HILL AND A GENTLE BREEZE ENTERING THROUGH THE WINDOWS ALWAYS FLUNG WIDE OPEN
NO THE PROPER THING WAS TO FACE IT OUT ALONE FOR MYSELF WAIT FOR ANOTHER CHANCE
A HAIR'S BREADTH HE MUTTERED NOT THE BREADTH OF A HAIR BETWEEN THIS AND THAT AND AT THE TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE A HAIR AT MIDNIGHT I PUT IN
AND HE HAD BEEN DELIBERATING UPON DEATH CONFOUND HIM HE HAD FOUND THAT TO MEDITATE ABOUT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE WHILE ALL ITS GLAMOUR HAD GONE WITH THE SHIP IN THE NIGHT WHAT MORE NATURAL
I KNEW THERE WAS NO OTHER BULKHEAD IN THE SHIP BUT THE COLLISION BULKHEAD SEPARATING THE FOREPEAK FROM THE FOREHOLD I WENT BACK TO TELL THE CAPTAIN I CAME UPON THE SECOND ENGINEER GETTING UP AT THE FOOT OF THE BRIDGE LADDER HE SEEMED DAZED AND
HIS VOICE SOUNDED REASONABLE SUPPOSE I HAD NOT I MEAN TO SAY SUPPOSE I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP WELL HOW MUCH LONGER SAY A MINUTE HALF A MINUTE
BROUGHT INTO THE BARE ROOM THE SOFTNESS OF THE SKY THE LANGUOR OF THE EARTH THE BEWITCHING BREATH OF THE EASTERN WATERS THERE WERE PERFUMES IN IT SUGGESTIONS OF INFINITE REPOSE THE GIFT OF ENDLESS DREAMS
NOBODY WOULD KNOW OF COURSE BUT THIS DID NOT MAKE IT ANY EASIER FOR ME YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT TOO I DID NOT WANT ALL THIS TALK NO YES I WON'T LIE
IT WAS AN ACT OF INTELLIGENT VOLITION JIM BETWEEN TWO QUESTIONS FORGOT HIMSELF SO FAR AS TO FIND LEISURE FOR A THOUGHT THIS FELLOW RAN THE THOUGHT LOOKS AT ME AS THOUGH HE COULD SEE SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING PAST MY SHOULDER
I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN I AM I AM A GENTLEMAN TOO YES YES I SAID HASTILY HE WAS LOOKING ME SQUARELY IN THE FACE AND WITHDREW HIS GAZE SLOWLY
KEEP UP THE ILLUSION OF MY BEGINNINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD ROBBED OUR COMMON LIFE OF THE LAST SPARK OF ITS GLAMOUR AND SO YOU CLEARED OUT AT ONCE JUMPED HE CORRECTED ME INCISIVELY JUMPED MIND
IN THEIR APPEARANCE OF DOING SO WELL ON SUCH A SMALL ALLOWANCE OF DANGER AND TOIL IN TIME BESIDE THE ORIGINAL DISDAIN THERE GREW UP SLOWLY ANOTHER SENTIMENT AND SUDDENLY GIVING UP THE IDEA OF GOING HOME
AND WHEN CLEAR OF CONFINING RAILS SPREAD ON ALL SIDES OVER THE DECK FLOWED FORWARD AND AFT OVERFLOWED DOWN THE YAWNING HATCHWAYS FILLED THE INNER RECESSES OF THE SHIP LIKE WATER FILLING A CISTERN
I WASN'T GOING TO RUN AWAY AT FIRST AT NIGHT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THOSE FELLOWS I MIGHT HAVE NO BY HEAVENS I WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM THAT SATISFACTION THEY HAD DONE ENOUGH THEY MADE UP A STORY AND BELIEVED IT FOR ALL I KNOW
DISABLED BY A FALLING SPAR AT THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK OF WHICH HIS SCOTTISH CAPTAIN USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS MAN IT'S A PAIRFECT MEERACLE TO ME HOW SHE LIVED THROUGH IT SPENT MANY DAYS STRETCHED ON HIS BACK DAZED BATTERED HOPELESS
THEY STREAMED ABOARD OVER THREE GANGWAYS THEY STREAMED IN URGED BY FAITH AND THE HOPE OF PARADISE THEY STREAMED IN WITH A CONTINUOUS TRAMP AND SHUFFLE OF BARE FEET WITHOUT A WORD A MURMUR OR A LOOK BACK
ENVELOPED IN A FULGOR OF SUNSHINE THAT KILLED ALL THOUGHT OPPRESSED THE HEART WITHERED ALL IMPULSES OF STRENGTH AND ENERGY AND UNDER THE SINISTER SPLENDOUR OF THAT SKY THE SEA BLUE AND PROFOUND REMAINED STILL WITHOUT A STIR
ITS EYE OF FLAME AS IF IN DERISION OF HER ERRAND OF FAITH SHE CLEARED THE STRAIT CROSSED THE BAY CONTINUED ON HER WAY THROUGH THE ONE DEGREE PASSAGE SHE HELD ON STRAIGHT FOR THE RED SEA UNDER A SERENE SKY
BUT IT WASN'T TRUTH ALL THE SAME IT WAS SOMETHING ONE KNOWS A DOWNRIGHT LIE THERE WAS NOT THE THICKNESS OF A SHEET OF PAPER BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG OF THIS AFFAIR
A LITTLE VICIOUSLY I FEAR DON'T YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN BY THE SOLIDARITY OF THE CRAFT I WAS AGGRIEVED AGAINST HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CHEATED ME
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GREED OF ADVENTURES THAT ARE THEIR OWN AND ONLY REWARD WHAT WE GET WELL WE WON'T TALK OF THAT BUT CAN ONE OF US RESTRAIN A SMILE
AND IN DRILL SUITS THAT SEEMED TO FIT THEM AS CLOSE AS THEIR SKINS AND HOLDING THEIR ROUND PITH HATS ON THEIR KNEES WHILE GLIDING ALONG THE WALLS THE COURT PEONS BUTTONED TIGHT IN LONG WHITE COATS FLITTED RAPIDLY TO AND FRO
GLITTER OF THE VAST SURFACE WHICH IS ONLY A REFLECTION OF HIS OWN GLANCES FULL OF FIRE THERE IS SUCH MAGNIFICENT VAGUENESS IN THE EXPECTATIONS THAT HAD DRIVEN EACH OF US TO SEA SUCH A GLORIOUS INDEFINITENESS
HE SEEMED CALM ENOUGH ONLY HE STUMBLED SEVERAL TIMES AND ONCE AS I STOOD SPEAKING TO HIM HE WALKED RIGHT INTO ME AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STONE BLIND HE MADE NO DEFINITE ANSWER TO WHAT I HAD TO TELL
AND HIS VOICE SPOKE I WAS SO LOST YOU KNOW IT WAS THE SORT OF THING ONE DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAPPEN TO ONE IT WAS NOT LIKE A FIGHT FOR INSTANCE
HE APPEARED CHANGED AS IF HE HAD SUDDENLY MATURED ONE COULDN'T BE SURE HE MUTTERED AH YOU WERE NOT SURE I SAID
SURELY IN NO OTHER CRAFT AS IN THAT OF THE SEA DO THE HEARTS OF THOSE ALREADY LAUNCHED TO SINK OR SWIM GO OUT SO MUCH TO THE YOUTH ON THE BRINK LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES UPON THAT
I WAS TOLD TO CALL NO ONE AND TO MAKE NO NOISE FOR FEAR OF CREATING A PANIC I THOUGHT THE PRECAUTION REASONABLE I TOOK ONE OF THE LAMPS THAT WERE HUNG UNDER THE AWNINGS AND WENT FORWARD AFTER OPENING THE FOREPEAK HATCH I HEARD SPLASHING IN THERE
MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO FLOAT FOR HOURS IN THE OPEN SEA AND BE PICKED UP NOT MUCH THE WORSE FOR IT I MIGHT HAVE LASTED IT OUT BETTER THAN MANY OTHERS THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER WITH MY HEART
IN NO OTHER KIND OF LIFE IS THE ILLUSION MORE WIDE OF REALITY IN NO OTHER IS THE BEGINNING ALL ILLUSION THE DISENCHANTMENT MORE SWIFT THE SUBJUGATION MORE COMPLETE
FOR THE TERRIBLY DISTINCT QUESTIONS THAT EXTORTED HIS ANSWERS SEEMED TO SHAPE THEMSELVES IN ANGUISH AND PAIN WITHIN HIS BREAST CAME TO HIM POIGNANT AND SILENT
THE DETERMINATION TO LOUNGE SAFELY THROUGH EXISTENCE TO JIM THAT GOSSIPING CROWD VIEWED AS SEAMEN SEEMED AT FIRST MORE UNSUBSTANTIAL THAN SO MANY SHADOWS BUT AT LENGTH HE FOUND A FASCINATION IN THE SIGHT OF THOSE MEN
HAD PRESERVED AN UNDEFACED ENERGY WITH THE TEMPER OF BUCCANEERS AND THE EYES OF DREAMERS THEY APPEARED TO LIVE IN A CRAZY MAZE OF PLANS HOPES DANGERS ENTERPRISES AHEAD OF CIVILISATION IN THE DARK PLACES OF THE SEA

INSTRUCTING THEM TO TELL THE INDIANS THAT IF THEY WOULD COME IN AND MAKE TREATY WITH THE COMMISSIONERS THEY WOULD BE FURNISHED WITH FOOD AND CLOTHING AND BE PROTECTED BUT IF THEY DID NOT COME IN HE WOULD MAKE WAR UPON THEM AND KILL THEM ALL

AND WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN BOLING HE SAID IN GREAT EMOTION KILL ME SIR CAPTAIN YES KILL ME AS YOU KILLED MY SON AS YOU WOULD KILL MY PEOPLE IF THEY WERE TO COME TO YOU

THAT IT LOOKS AS IF IT HAD BEEN POLISHED AND RUBBED OVER WITH SNOW FOR THE HOLIDAYS VANKA SIGHS DIPS HIS PEN IN THE INK AND CONTINUES TO WRITE LAST NIGHT I GOT A THRASHING
BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND WHEN I AM DEAD I WILL CALL MY PEOPLE TO COME AND THEY SHALL HEAR ME IN THEIR SLEEP AND COME TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THEIR CHIEF AND HIS SON YES SIR AMERICA MY SPIRIT WILL MAKE TROUBLE FOR YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
TO THE MAJOR SAVAGE FIRMLY SAID YOUR PEOPLE MUST GO TO THE COMMISSIONERS IF THEY DO NOT YOUR YOUNG MEN WILL AGAIN STEAL HORSES AND KILL AND PLUNDER THE WHITES
MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF MY TRIBE HAVE COME FROM OTHER TRIBES AND IF THEY GO TO THE PLAINS AND ARE SEEN THEY WILL BE KILLED BY THE FRIENDS OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY HAVE QUARRELED I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS GROWING OLD AND IT WAS WELL THAT I SHOULD GO
WHICH SOME HAVE CLAIMED FOR HIM
SO SHE TOOK THE HERRING AND STUCK ITS SNOUT INTO MY FACE THE ASSISTANTS TEASE ME SEND ME TO THE TAVERN FOR VODKA MAKE ME STEAL THE MASTER'S CUCUMBERS AND THE MASTER BEATS ME WITH WHATEVER IS HANDY
POHONO THE BRIDAL VEIL BEING THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE EXPEDITION REMAINED ONLY ONE DAY AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE VALLEY HURRYING OUT ON THE APPROACH OF A STORM AND REACHED THE SOUTH FORK HEADQUARTERS
AND I AM FRIGHTFULLY HUNGRY AND SO SAD THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU I CRY ALL THE TIME THE OTHER DAY THE MASTER HIT ME ON THE HEAD WITH A LAST I FELL TO THE GROUND AND ONLY JUST RETURNED TO LIFE
THEY MAKE ME SLEEP IN THE VESTIBULE AND WHEN THEIR BRAT CRIES I DON'T SLEEP AT ALL BUT HAVE TO ROCK THE CRADLE DEAR GRANDPAPA FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE TAKE ME AWAY FROM HERE
WHICH WAS NOT IN THE BOYISH SAKI'S EQUIPMENT HE LEAVES LOOSE ENDS EVERYWHERE NOR IN HIS DIALOGUE DELIGHTFUL AS IT OFTEN IS FUNNY AS IT NEARLY ALWAYS IS IS HE THE SUPREME MASTER
THE VERIEST LOUT OF ALL SHALL BE THEIR JUDGE O HORRIBLE AND DANGEROUS DELUGE DELUGE I CALL IT AND THAT FOR GOOD REASON FOR THIS SHALL BE OMITTED IN NO SEASON
WITHOUT BEING DISTRACTED OR DIVERTED BY HIS CARNAL AFFECTIONS AND DEPRAVED NATURE THE MONK THEN SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK IN YOUR CONSCIENCE IS MEANT AND SIGNIFIED BY THIS RIDDLE WHAT
AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG THEN FLOG ME LIKE THE GREY GOAT AND IF YOU REALLY THINK I SHAN'T FIND WORK
FOOD THERE IS NONE IN THE MORNING IT'S BREAD AT DINNER GRUEL AND IN THE EVENING BREAD AGAIN AS FOR TEA OR SOUR CABBAGE SOUP THE MASTER AND THE MISTRESS THEMSELVES GUZZLE THAT
FROM WHOM HE HAD INQUIRED THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD TOLD HIM THAT LETTERS WERE TO BE PUT INTO POST BOXES AND FROM THERE THEY WERE CONVEYED OVER THE WHOLE EARTH IN MAIL TROIKAS BY DRUNKEN POST BOYS
TENAYA INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF TAKING ALL THE INDIANS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN PLAIN MY PEOPLE
IF SAKI'S CARELESS CRUELTY THAT STRANGE BOYISH INSENSITIVENESS OF HIS DID NOT GIVE HIM AN UNFAIR START IN THE PURSUIT OF LAUGHTER IT MAY HAVE BEEN SO BUT FORTUNATELY
HIS CUDGEL WILL BE HANGING FROM HIS BELT HE WILL BE HUGGING HIMSELF WITH COLD GIVING A LITTLE DRY OLD MAN'S COUGH AND AT TIMES PINCHING A SERVANT GIRL OR A COOK WON'T WE TAKE SOME SNUFF
INARIME DID NOT MORE QUICKLY MOVE WHEN TYPHEUS DID THE VAST HUGE HILLS REMOVE AND FOR DESPITE INTO THE SEA THEM THREW THUS SHALL IT THEN BE LOST BY WAYS NOT FEW
THOUGH IT BE AT HAND YEA AND BEFORE THERE SHALL APPEAR A RACE OF MEN WHO LOTH TO SIT STILL IN ONE PLACE SHALL BOLDLY GO BEFORE ALL PEOPLE'S EYES SUBORNING MEN OF DIVERS QUALITIES TO DRAW THEM
AND VIVIDLY PICTURED TO HIMSELF HIS GRANDFATHER
HE ASKS HOLDING OUT HIS SNUFF BOX TO THE WOMEN THE WOMEN TAKE A PINCH OF SNUFF AND SNEEZE THE OLD MAN GOES INTO INDESCRIBABLE ECSTASIES BREAKS INTO LOUD LAUGHTER AND CRIES
ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY AFTER STARTING OUT
WHEN MISTER J M HUTCHINGS HAVING HEARD OF ITS WONDERFUL SCENERY COLLECTED A PARTY AND MADE THE FIRST REGULAR TOURIST'S VISIT TO THE YOSEMITE
THEN SPREADING A CRUMPLED SHEET OF PAPER IN FRONT OF HIM HE BEGAN TO WRITE BEFORE HOWEVER DECIDING TO MAKE THE FIRST LETTER HE LOOKED FURTIVELY AT THE DOOR AND AT THE WINDOW GLANCED SEVERAL TIMES AT THE SOMBRE IKON
OUR EFFORTS TO BE FUNNY IN THE SAKI MANNER HAVE NOT SURVIVED TO PROVE IT WHAT IS SAKI'S MANNER
MY MASTER DRAGGED ME BY MY HAIR INTO THE YARD AND BELABOURED ME WITH A SHOE MAKER'S STIRRUP BECAUSE
IN DARK AND OBSCURE TERMS THE SUBORNERS OF MEN ARE THE MAKERS OF MATCHES WHICH ARE COMMONLY FRIENDS AFTER THE TWO CHASES ARE MADE HE THAT WAS IN THE UPPER END OF THE TENNIS COURT GOETH OUT
ALL FOR SALE AND FOR EVERY KIND OF FISH AWFULLY CONVENIENT AND THERE WAS ONE HOOK WHICH WOULD CATCH A SHEAT FISH WEIGHING A POUND AND THERE ARE SHOPS WITH GUNS LIKE THE MASTER'S AND I AM SURE THEY MUST COST ONE HUNDRED RUBLES EACH
O HE IS WORTHY PRAISE THAT SHRINKETH NOT NO SOONER WAS THIS ENIGMATICAL MONUMENT READ OVER BUT GARGANTUA FETCHING A VERY DEEP SIGH SAID UNTO THOSE THAT STOOD BY
THE CORNERS OF VANKA'S MOUTH WENT DOWN HE RUBBED HIS EYES WITH HIS DIRTY FIST AND SOBBED I'LL GRATE YOUR TOBACCO FOR YOU HE CONTINUED I'LL PRAY TO GOD FOR YOU
BUT WAS CAUGHT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SWIM ACROSS THE RIVER
LIKE EVERY ARTIST WORTH CONSIDERATION HE HAD NO RECIPE IF HIS EXOTIC CHOICE OF SUBJECT WAS OFTEN HIS STRENGTH IT WAS OFTEN HIS WEAKNESS
AND CHILDREN THEIR OWN PARENTS IN A WORD ALL REVERENCE SHALL THEN BE BANISHED NO TRUE RESPECT TO OTHER SHALL BE HAD THEY'LL SAY THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS TURN BOTH IN HIS GOING FORTH AND HIS RETURN
IF IT BE LAWFUL FIRMLY TO BELIEVE
INSISTING THAT SHE SHALL SHARE OUR DELIGHT IN THEM AND THERE ARE BOOKS EQUALLY DEAR TO US OF WHICH WE SAY NOTHING FEARING LEST THE PRAISE OF OTHERS
MORE THAN ONCE THEY HAD NEARLY BROKEN HIS HIND LEGS TWICE HE HAD BEEN HUNG UP EVERY WEEK HE WAS NEARLY FLOGGED TO DEATH BUT HE ALWAYS RECOVERED AT THIS MOMENT FOR CERTAIN
NOT A BREATH OF WIND CLEAR AND FROSTY
AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT BY ACT OF CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY OF THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK AND THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN O FIVE OF THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE
WHO TRUSTING TOO MUCH IN THEIR HOPEFUL TIME LIVE BUT A WHILE AND PERISH IN THEIR PRIME NEITHER SHALL ANY WHO THIS COURSE SHALL RUN LEAVE OFF THE RACE WHICH HE HATH ONCE BEGUN
MY YOUNG MEN BELIEVED THAT THE GOLD DIGGERS WERE OUR ENEMIES
WHEN THE CAPTIVES WERE ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF THE TWO WHITE MEN THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD KILLED THEM TO PREVENT WHITE MEN FROM COMING TO THEIR VALLEY DECLARING THAT IT WAS THEIR HOME AND THAT WHITE MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO COME THERE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
TAUGHT HIM TO READ WRITE COUNT UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND EVEN TO DANCE THE QUADRILLE WHEN PELAGUEYA DIED THEY PLACED THE ORPHAN VANKA IN THE KITCHEN WITH HIS GRANDFATHER AND FROM THE KITCHEN HE WAS SENT TO MOSCOW
AND YET BEFORE THAT THEY BE CLEAN DISPERST
THE LIEUTENANT BEING FULLY SATISFIED THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE REAL MURDERERS PROMPTLY PRONOUNCED JUDGMENT AND HAD THEM PLACED IN LINE AND SHOT LIEUTENANT MOORE PURSUED THE FUGITIVES TO MONO BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING ANY OF THEM
AND GUIDED BY ONE OF TENAYA'S INDIANS DESCENDED BY THE SAME ROUTE AS THAT FOLLOWED BY THE MARIPOSA TRAIL AND THE WEARY PARTY WENT INTO CAMP ON THE RIVER BANK OPPOSITE EL CAPITAN AFTER SUPPER SEATED AROUND A BIG FIRE
MYSELF BUT LATELY DOWN FROM SAINT JAMES I WAS NOT TOO PROUD TO TAKE SOME SLIGHT BUT PITYING INTEREST IN MEN OF OTHER COLLEGES THE UNUSUAL NAME OF A FRESHMAN UP AT WESTMINSTER ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION
AND SAID HIS PEOPLE WERE ON THE WAY TO OUR CAMP TO GO WITH THE MEN SENT BY THE GREAT FATHER WHO WAS SO GOOD AND RICH ANOTHER DAY PASSED BUT NO INDIANS FROM THE DEEP VALLEY APPEARED
AND MISSUS PACKLETIDE'S TIGER SEEM TO ME TO BE THE MASTERPIECES OF THIS BOOK IN BOTH OF THEM CLOVIS EXERCISES NEEDLESSLY HIS TITULAR RIGHT OF ENTRY BUT HE CAN BE REMOVED WITHOUT DAMAGE
CONSISTING OF SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN PERSONS THE NEXT YEAR THE REGULAR PLEASURE TRAVEL BEGAN AND A TRAIL ON THE MARIPOSA SIDE OF THE VALLEY WAS OPENED BY MANN BROTHERS THIS TRAIL WAS AFTERWARDS PURCHASED BY THE CITIZENS OF THE COUNTY
SUCH WOES SUCH JARRINGS
ALMOST AS SOON AS HE WAS DISCOVERABLE LET US SPARE A MOMENT AND A TEAR FOR THOSE GOLDEN DAYS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS WHEN THERE WERE FIVE LEISURELY PAPERS OF AN EVENING
THE CHILDREN DON'T COME ROUND AT CHRISTMAS WITH A STAR NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO SING IN THE CHOIR
HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS GRANDFATHER ALWAYS WENT TO THE FOREST FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND TOOK HIS GRANDSON WITH HIM WHAT HAPPY TIMES THE FROST CRACKLED HIS GRANDFATHER CRACKLED AND AS THEY BOTH DID
BUT I HAVE NO BOOTS AND I WAS AFRAID OF THE FROST AND WHEN I GROW UP I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU
HAD GONE OUT TO AN EARLY CHURCH SERVICE TO PROCURE FROM HIS EMPLOYER'S CUPBOARD
WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE THIS WARLIKE TRIBE AND CONDUCT THEM TO THE FRESNO RESERVATION THAT THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN HOME THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SPARE THE FLOCKS OF BEASTS THAT INNOCENTEST ARE BUT DID THEIR SINEWS AND THEIR BOWELS TAKE NOT TO THE GODS A SACRIFICE TO MAKE BUT USUALLY TO SERVE THEMSELVES FOR SPORT
BUT I AM NOW WILLING TO GO FOR IT IS BEST FOR MY PEOPLE PUSHING AHEAD TAKING TURNS IN BREAKING A WAY THROUGH THE SNOW THEY ARRIVED IN SIGHT OF THE GREAT VALLEY EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON
THROUGH AN INTERPRETER EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT THE OCCURRENCE BUT NOT A WORD DID TENAYA UTTER IN REPLY LATER
LATER ONE HEARD THAT THIS UNDERGRADUATE FROM OVERSEAS HAD GONE UP AT AN AGE MORE ADVANCED THAN CUSTOMARY
IS THE WORD PRIVILEGE THE DESIGN WHEN FINALLY DEVELOPED WAS A SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT TO MONSIEUR DEPLIS WHO HAD SUSPECTED ICARUS OF BEING A FORTRESS
SO ONE FELT THAT THIS WESTMINSTER FREE LANCE IN THE THIRTIES WAS NO FIT COMPETITOR FOR THE YOUTH OF OTHER COLLEGES INDEED IT COULD NOT COMPETE WELL I DISCOVERED HIM
WHICH MADE ME THUS UNGENEROUS OF HIS NAME OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE FEELING THAT THE OTHERS WERE NOT WORTHY OF HIM BUT HOW REFRESHING IT WAS WHEN SOME INTELLECTUALLY BLOWN UP STRANGER SAID DO YOU EVER READ SAKI
AND WE SHALL BE GLAD TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH THEM WE WILL STAY HERE AND BE FRIENDS MY PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE PLAINS SOME OF THE TRIBES WHO HAVE GONE THERE ARE VERY BAD WE CANNOT LIVE WITH THEM HERE WE CAN DEFEND OURSELVES
SHOWED THAT THEY HAD BEEN HURRIEDLY ABANDONED THAT VERY DAY LATER FIVE YOUNG INDIANS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT TO WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EXPEDITION WERE CAPTURED AT THE FOOT OF THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER A LIVELY CHASE
TAKE A GOLDEN WALNUT AND HIDE IT IN MY GREEN BOX ASK THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA FOR IT SAY IT'S FOR VANKA VANKA SIGHED CONVULSIVELY AND AGAIN STARED AT THE WINDOW
SHORT TAILED DEVIL WHEN THE TREE WAS DOWN HIS GRANDFATHER DRAGGED IT TO THE MASTER'S HOUSE AND THERE THEY SET ABOUT DECORATING IT THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA VANKA'S GREAT FRIEND
TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY
TO SEE YOUR PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT COME THEY WILL COME IF I FIND THEM YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY OF MY PEOPLE THERE SAID TENAYA I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE MY TRIBE IS SMALL
ALWAYS SMILING AND BLEAR EYED ALL DAY HE SLEPT IN THE SERVANTS KITCHEN OR TRIFLED WITH THE COOKS
A SECOND EXPEDITION WAS MADE IN THE SAME YEAR UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR BOLING WHEN THE VALLEY WAS ENTERED NO INDIANS WERE SEEN BUT THE MANY WIGWAMS WITH SMOLDERING FIRES
MOST OF IT HAD BEEN EXPLORED IN A GENERAL WAY AND SOME OF ITS PRINCIPAL FEATURES HAD BEEN NAMED BUT THE INDIANS HAD FLED UP THE TENAYA CANYON TRAIL AND NONE OF THEM WERE SEEN EXCEPT AN OLD WOMAN UNABLE TO FOLLOW THE FUGITIVES
AFTER WAITING STILL ANOTHER DAY THE EXPEDITION STARTED FOR THE VALLEY WHEN TENAYA WAS QUESTIONED AS TO THE ROUTE AND DISTANCE HE SAID THAT THE SNOW WAS SO DEEP THAT THE HORSES COULD NOT GO THROUGH IT
POOR MORTALS WHO WAIT FOR A HAPPY DAY CHEER UP YOUR HEARTS
DESCRIBED IT IN ARTICLES ILLUSTRATED BY A GOOD ARTIST WHO WAS TAKEN INTO THE VALLEY BY HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE
BY MISTER HUTCHINGS ALL THESE HOTELS HAVE VANISHED EXCEPT THE FRAME HOUSE BUILT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION A LARGE HOTEL BUILT ON THE BRINK OF THE RIVER IN FRONT OF THE OLD ONE
THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS ERECTED IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX AND WAS KEPT AS A HOTEL THE NEXT YEAR BY G A HITE AND LATER BY J H NEAL AND S M CUNNINGHAM
BUT HE WAS MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE WORK WHICH WAS ACCLAIMED BY ALL WHO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING IT AS PINCINI'S MASTERPIECE THIS STORY THE BACKGROUND
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE TO LET ME CLEAN THE BOOTS OR I'LL GO INSTEAD OF FEDYA AS UNDERHERDSMAN DEAR GRANDPAPA I CAN'T BEAR THIS ANY MORE IT'LL KILL ME I WANTED TO RUN AWAY TO OUR VILLAGE
ARE PERSECUTED BUT HAPPY IS THAT MAN THAT SHALL NOT BE SCANDALIZED BUT SHALL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO THE END IN AIMING AT THAT MARK WHICH GOD BY HIS DEAR SON HATH SET BEFORE US
SHALL CEASE TO DART UPON IT ANY LIGHT MORE THAN IN AN ECLIPSE OR IN THE NIGHT SO THAT AT ONCE ITS FAVOUR SHALL BE GONE AND LIBERTY WITH IT BE LEFT ALONE AND YET BEFORE IT COME TO RUIN THUS
I UNFORTUNATELY FELL ASLEEP AND DURING THE WEEK MY MISTRESS TOLD ME TO CLEAN A HERRING
MY YOUNG MEN HAVE SOMETIMES TAKEN HORSES AND MULES FROM THE WHITES
TO US MANY OTHERS WHO WERE TRYING TO DO IT TOO FOR WE WERE SO DOMESTIC HE SO TERRIFYINGLY COSMOPOLITAN WHILE WE WERE BEING FUNNY AS PLANNED WITH COLLAR STUDS AND HOT WATER BOTTLES
THE GLOBE TERRESTRIAL IS THE TENNIS BALL AFTER PLAYING WHEN THE GAME IS DONE THEY REFRESH THEMSELVES BEFORE A CLEAR FIRE AND CHANGE THEIR SHIRTS AND VERY WILLINGLY THEY MAKE ALL GOOD CHEER
IS GUARDED JEALOUSLY FROM ALL BUT A FEW INTIMATES THE SECRET TO TAKE A CONTRARY CASE OF OUR INFALLIBLE REMEDY FOR SEASICKNESS IS THRUST UPON EVERY TRAVELLER WE MEET
THE YOUNG FIR TREES WRAPT IN HOAR FROST STOOD MOTIONLESS WAITING FOR WHICH OF THEM WOULD DIE SUDDENLY A HARE SPRINGING FROM SOMEWHERE WOULD DART OVER THE SNOWDRIFT HIS GRANDFATHER COULD NOT HELP SHOUTING CATCH IT CATCH IT
HE HAS A CHOICE OF WORDS A WAY OF PUTTING THINGS WHICH IS AS INEVITABLY HIS OWN VINTAGE AS ONCE TASTED IT BECOMES THE PRIVATE VINTAGE OF THE CONNOISSEUR
MY LIFE IS A MISFORTUNE WORSE THAN ANY DOG'S I SEND GREETINGS TO ALIONA TO ONE EYED TEGOR AND THE COACHMAN AND DON'T LET ANY ONE HAVE MY MOUTH ORGAN I REMAIN YOUR GRANDSON
WHO HAD BEEN APPRENTICE TO THE SHOEMAKER ALIAKHIN FOR THREE MONTHS DID NOT GO TO BED THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS
IT IS USELESS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHO DESTROYED YOUR PROPERTY AND KILLED YOUR PEOPLE I AM OLD AND YOU CAN KILL ME IF YOU WILL BUT IT IS USELESS TO LIE TO YOU WHO KNOW MORE THAN ALL THE INDIANS
THEY STOLE A NUMBER OF STOLEN HORSES FROM THEIR ENTERTAINERS AND MADE THEIR WAY BY A LONG OBSCURE ROUTE BY THE HEAD OF THE NORTH FORK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
BUT THAT YOUNG AND STRONG MEN CAN FIND PLENTY IN THE MOUNTAINS THEREFORE WHY SHOULD THEY GO TO THE HOT PLAINS TO BE PENNED UP LIKE HORSES AND CATTLE MY HEART HAS BEEN SORE SINCE THAT TALK
IF HIS INSENSITIVENESS CARRIED HIM THROUGH AT TIMES TO VICTORY IT BROUGHT HIM AT TIMES TO DEFEAT I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS THAT MASTERY OF THE CONTE IN THIS BOOK AT LEAST
LOCATE IS THE PLEASANT WORD HERE STILL MORE SATISFYING IN THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO WAS TATTOOED FROM COLLAR BONE TO WAIST LINE WITH A GLOWING REPRESENTATION OF THE FALL OF ICARUS
THE YOSEMITE OR GRIZZLY BEAR TRIBE FANCYING THEMSELVES SECURE IN THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD WERE THE MOST TROUBLESOME AND DEFIANT OF ALL AND IT WAS WHILE THE MARIPOSA BATTALION UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR SAVAGE
IN WHICH THE FREE LANCE MIGHT GRADUATE AND HE COULD SPEAK OF HIS ALMA MATER WHETHER THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WITH AS MUCH PRIDE AS HE NEVER DOUBTED THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WOULD SPEAK ONE DAY OF HIM
OF COURSE SHE SAID YES AS MY TIME DREW NEARER
WHEN SHE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT MISTER FRANKLIN THE CONFERENCE BETWEEN US CONDUCTED IN THIS WAY WAS TIRESOME ENOUGH UNTIL MY DAUGHTER SUDDENLY ENDED IT BY BURSTING OUT WITH WHAT I THOUGHT THE MOST MONSTROUS SUPPOSITION I HAD EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE
THE WARDEN HUNG HIS HEAD AND MADE NO REPLY HE COULD NOT CONDESCEND TO SAY THAT HE HAD NOT INTENDED TO GIVE HIS SON IN LAW THE SLIP AND AS HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO AVOW IT HE SAID NOTHING PAPA HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU
AND SAID I AM SURE SUSAN WILL NOT ASK ME TO BREAK MY WORD OR TO DO WHAT I KNOW TO BE WRONG PAPA SAID SHE IT WOULD BE MADNESS IN YOU TO THROW UP YOUR PREFERMENT WHAT ARE YOU TO LIVE ON
IN POINT OF FACT YOU CAN'T RESIGN THE BISHOP WOULDN'T ACCEPT IT THE WHOLE THING IS SETTLED WHAT I NOW WANT TO DO IS TO PREVENT ANY INCONVENIENT TITTLE TATTLE ANY MORE NEWSPAPER ARTICLES THAT'S WHAT I WANT TOO
WITH THE NATURAL CURIOSITY OF WOMEN TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION THIS TIME SHE ONLY WANTED ME TO TELL HER
REMEMBER WHAT ADAM WANTED WHEN HE WAS ALONE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN AND IF YOU DON'T BLAME IT IN ADAM DON'T BLAME IT IN ME THE WOMAN I FIXED MY EYE ON WAS THE WOMAN WHO KEPT HOUSE FOR ME AT MY COTTAGE HER NAME WAS SELINA GOBY
THEN YOUR THREAT OF RESIGNATION AMOUNTS TO NOTHING AND WE ARE JUST WHERE WE WERE BEFORE MISTER HARDING WAS NOW STANDING ON THE RUG MOVING UNEASILY FROM ONE FOOT TO THE OTHER
YOU HEAR MORE THAN ENOUGH OF MARRIED PEOPLE LIVING TOGETHER MISERABLY HERE IS AN EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY LET IT BE A WARNING TO SOME OF YOU AND AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO OTHERS IN THE MEANTIME I WILL GO ON WITH MY STORY WELL
THE ARCHDEACON WAS PACING THE ROOM EXPRESSING BY CERTAIN NODS OF HIS HEAD HIS OPINION OF THE UTTER FATUITY OF HIS FATHER IN LAW WHY AT LAST HE SAID
AND SHE HAD COME TO MY COTTAGE TO WHEEDLE ME IF I MAY USE SUCH AN EXPRESSION INTO GIVING UP MY HARD OUT OF DOOR WORK AS BAILIFF AND TAKING MY EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AS STEWARD IN THE HOUSE I MADE AS GOOD A FIGHT OF IT
BUT SUSAN DIDN'T WANT TO GO TILL HER HUSBAND WENT SHE HAD AN IDEA THAT HER PAPA MIGHT BE BULLIED IF SHE WERE AWAY SHE WASN'T TIRED AT ALL
WHILE IN TO MORROW'S HUMOUR AND THE THING WAS DONE MY MIND BEING RELIEVED IN THIS MANNER I WENT TO SLEEP THAT NIGHT IN THE CHARACTER OF LADY VERINDER'S FARM BAILIFF
EIGHTY POUNDS A YEAR SNEERED THE ARCHDEACON AND THE PRECENTORSHIP SAID THE FATHER IN LAW IT GOES WITH THE WARDENSHIP SAID THE SON IN LAW MISTER HARDING WAS PREPARED TO ARGUE THIS POINT
A DOCTOR DOES WHEN RECOMMENDED BY AN OLD WOMAN TO TAKE SOME FAVOURITE DOSE OR AS A LAWYER WHEN AN UNPROFESSIONAL MAN ATTEMPTS TO PUT HIM DOWN BY A QUIBBLE I SHALL HAVE THE LIVING OF CRABTREE MODESTLY SUGGESTED THE WARDEN
I WAS LEFT WITH MY LITTLE GIRL PENELOPE AND WITH NO OTHER CHILD SHORTLY AFTERWARDS SIR JOHN DIED AND MY LADY WAS LEFT WITH HER LITTLE GIRL MISS RACHEL AND NO OTHER CHILD I HAVE WRITTEN TO VERY POOR PURPOSE OF MY LADY
WHEN I WANTED TO GO UP STAIRS THERE WAS MY WIFE COMING DOWN
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE WARDEN IS VERY OBSTINATE DOCTOR GRANTLY IS HERE SIR GREETED HIS EARS BEFORE THE DOOR WAS WELL OPEN AND MISSUS GRANTLY
EVERY WORD OF IT TRUE BUT SHE POINTS OUT ONE OBJECTION SHE SAYS WHAT I HAVE DONE SO FAR ISN'T IN THE LEAST WHAT I WAS WANTED TO DO
MY FEET BETRAYED ME ON THE GRAVEL BEFORE I COULD STEAL SUDDENLY ROUND THE CORNER AS I HAD PROPOSED I HEARD LIGHTER FEET THAN MINE AND MORE THAN ONE PAIR OF THEM AS I THOUGHT RETREATING IN A HURRY
THEY HAVE A SITTING ROOM ABOVE AND ARE WAITING UP FOR YOU THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE TONE OF THE MAN'S VOICE WHICH SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT EVEN HE LOOKED UPON THE WARDEN AS A RUNAWAY SCHOOLBOY JUST RECAPTURED BY HIS GUARDIAN
THAT HAD EVER TRIED HIS TRAINING IN SERVICE LATER IN THE EVENING WE HEARD THEM SINGING AND PLAYING DUETS MISTER FRANKLIN PIPING HIGH MISS RACHEL PIPING HIGHER AND MY LADY ON THE PIANO FOLLOWING THEM AS IT WERE OVER HEDGE AND DITCH
IT'S TWELVE O'CLOCK YES MY DEAR SAID THE WARDEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL NAMED TEN FOR MY MEETING TO BE SURE TEN IS LATE BUT WHAT COULD I DO YOU KNOW GREAT MEN WILL HAVE THEIR OWN WAY
AFTER ALL OUR EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE DIAMOND EARLIER IN THE DAY HOW THE MEETING BETWEEN MISTER FRANKLIN AND HIS AUNT AND COUSIN WENT OFF IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL YOU I WOULD HAVE GIVEN SOMETHING TO HAVE WAITED AT TABLE THAT DAY
IF THE RAVENS PERSISTED IN REFUSING THE FOOD PREPARED FOR THEM THEY WOULDN'T BE FED A CLERGYMAN GENERALLY DISLIKES TO BE MET IN ARGUMENT BY ANY SCRIPTURAL QUOTATION HE FEELS AS AFFRONTED AS
WHAT TO MORROW WE HATE I SAW MY WAY CLEAR DIRECTLY TO DAY I WAS ALL FOR CONTINUING TO BE FARM BAILIFF TO MORROW ON THE AUTHORITY OF ROBINSON CRUSOE I SHOULD BE ALL THE OTHER WAY TAKE MYSELF TO MORROW
HAD THEY HEARD ANYTHING OF EACH OTHER IMPOSSIBLE AGAIN I COULD SPEAK TO MISTER FRANKLIN'S ASTONISHMENT AS GENUINE WHEN HE SAW HOW THE GIRL STARED AT HIM PENELOPE COULD SPEAK TO THE GIRL'S INQUISITIVENESS AS GENUINE
WHICH WAS ONE REASON FOR MARRYING HER I HAD ANOTHER REASON LIKEWISE ENTIRELY OF MY OWN DISCOVERING SELINA BEING A SINGLE WOMAN MADE ME PAY SO MUCH A WEEK FOR HER BOARD AND SERVICES SELINA BEING MY WIFE
THERE I WAS IN CLOVER YOU WILL SAY
BUT IN MY POSITION IN THE HOUSEHOLD WAITING AT DINNER EXCEPT ON HIGH FAMILY FESTIVALS WAS LETTING DOWN MY DIGNITY IN THE EYES OF THE OTHER SERVANTS A THING WHICH MY LADY CONSIDERED ME QUITE PRONE ENOUGH TO DO ALREADY WITHOUT SEEKING OCCASIONS FOR IT
AND HAD GONE OFF AGAIN ON HORSEBACK NEEDLESS ALSO TO SAY THAT THEY ASKED AWKWARD QUESTIONS DIRECTLY AND THAT THE FOREIGN POLITICS AND THE FALLING ASLEEP IN THE SUN WOULDN'T SERVE A SECOND TIME OVER WITH THEM BEING AT THE END OF MY INVENTION
YOU KNOW YOU NEVER EXPECTED PAPA TO PAY THE COSTS SUCH ABSURDITY IS ENOUGH TO PROVOKE JOB SAID THE ARCHDEACON MARCHING QUICKLY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM YOUR FATHER IS LIKE A CHILD EIGHT HUNDRED POUNDS A YEAR
IN CASES OF DOUBT AND EMERGENCY I SMOKED A PIPE AND TOOK A TURN AT ROBINSON CRUSOE
WHEN ALL THE DOORS WERE MADE FAST EXCEPT THE SIDE DOOR THAT OPENED ON THE TERRACE I SENT SAMUEL TO BED AND STEPPED OUT FOR A BREATH OF FRESH AIR BEFORE I TOO
I ACCORDINGLY REPLIED THAT MISTER FRANKLIN AND I HAD BOTH TALKED OF FOREIGN POLITICS TILL WE COULD TALK NO LONGER AND HAD THEN MUTUALLY FALLEN ASLEEP IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN TRY THAT SORT OF ANSWER WHEN YOUR WIFE OR YOUR DAUGHTER
BUT THE BROAD MOONLIGHT SHOWED FAIR ON THE GRAVEL WALK THAT RAN ALONG THE NEXT SIDE TO THE TERRACE LOOKING THIS WAY AFTER LOOKING UP AT THE SKY I SAW THE SHADOW OF A PERSON IN THE MOONLIGHT THROWN FORWARD FROM BEHIND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE
RESIGN THIS WARDENSHIP THEN MISTER HARDING THERE IS NOTHING BEFORE YOU BUT RUIN SAID THE ARCHDEACON NOW MOVED BEYOND ALL ENDURANCE
BOLD HAS BEEN COMPELLED TO ABANDON HIS ACTION AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO REMAIN QUIET AT THE HOSPITAL MISTER HARDING STILL MADE NO REPLY BUT LOOKED MEEKLY INTO HIS SON IN LAW'S FACE
AND ON THE DINGY SOFA BEHIND HIM RECLINED HIS PATIENT WIFE
AND THAT HE PITIED THE CULPRIT THOUGH HE COULD NOT BUT BE HORRIFIED AT THE CRIME THE WARDEN ENDEAVOURED TO APPEAR UNCONCERNED AS HE SAID OH INDEED I'LL GO UPSTAIRS AT ONCE BUT HE FAILED SIGNALLY
THE EVENING CAME AND THE DRESSING BELL FOR DINNER RANG BEFORE MISTER FRANKLIN RETURNED FROM FRIZINGHALL I TOOK HIS HOT WATER UP TO HIS ROOM MYSELF EXPECTING TO HEAR AFTER THIS EXTRAORDINARY DELAY
TAKING UP A SIDE CANDLE AT ANY RATE YOU'LL PROMISE ME TO TAKE NO FURTHER STEP WITHOUT CONSULTATION SAID THE ARCHDEACON MISTER HARDING MADE NO ANSWER BUT SLOWLY PROCEEDED TO LIGHT HIS CANDLE
AND WERE HIDDEN FROM SIGHT AMONG THE THICK TREES AND BUSHES IN THAT PART OF THE GROUNDS FROM THE SHRUBBERY THEY COULD EASILY MAKE THEIR WAY OVER OUR FENCE INTO THE ROAD IF I HAD BEEN FORTY YEARS YOUNGER
SOME SUCH IDEA AS THIS WAS ON HIS MIND BUT HE GAVE NO UTTERANCE TO IT THEN HE THOUGHT OF THE PELICAN FEEDING ITS YOUNG WITH BLOOD FROM ITS OWN BREAST BUT HE GAVE NO UTTERANCE TO THAT EITHER AND THEN OF ELEANOR
IS A REAL COMFORT AT STARTING IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THE FASHIONABLE WORLD YOU HAVE HEARD TELL OF THE THREE BEAUTIFUL MISS HERNCASTLES MISS ADELAIDE MISS CAROLINE
NOT FOR NOTHING I WAS TOO JUST A MAN TO EXPECT SHE WOULD LET ME OFF FOR NOTHING COMPENSATION TO THE WOMAN WHEN THE MAN GETS OUT OF IT IS ONE OF THE LAWS OF ENGLAND
MY DAUGHTER PENELOPE GOT IN MY WAY JUST AS HER LATE MOTHER USED TO GET IN MY WAY ON THE STAIRS AND INSTANTLY SUMMONED ME TO TELL HER ALL THAT HAD PASSED AT THE CONFERENCE BETWEEN MISTER FRANKLIN AND ME UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES THE ONE THING TO BE DONE
HE MADE NO DISTINCT ANSWER TO THE ARCHDEACON'S LAST PROPOSITION FOR HIS MIND WAS CHIEFLY ENGAGED ON THINKING HOW HE COULD ESCAPE TO BED THAT HIS RESIGNATION WAS A THING FINALLY FIXED ON A FACT ALL BUT COMPLETED
THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO MY GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT AND NO DOUBT TO YOURS ALSO NOTHING HAD HAPPENED HE HAD NOT MET WITH THE INDIANS EITHER GOING OR RETURNING HE HAD DEPOSITED THE MOONSTONE IN THE BANK
BY THE TIME I HAD GOT TO THE CORNER THE TRESPASSERS WHOEVER THEY WERE
THERE I LIVED TILL MISS JULIA MARRIED THE LATE SIR JOHN VERINDER AN EXCELLENT MAN WHO ONLY WANTED SOMEBODY TO MANAGE HIM AND BETWEEN OURSELVES HE FOUND SOMEBODY TO DO IT AND WHAT IS MORE HE THROVE ON IT AND GREW FAT ON IT AND LIVED HAPPY AND DIED EASY ON IT
AND THE GALLERIES HAVE APPLAUDED WITH A COUPLE OF ROUNDS RESIGNED IT GOOD HEAVENS AND THE DIGNITARY OF THE CHURCH SANK BACK HORRIFIED INTO A HORSEHAIR ARM CHAIR AT LEAST
I RECEIVED THIS MAGNIFICENT PRESENT QUITE AT A LOSS TO FIND WORDS TO THANK MY MISTRESS WITH FOR THE HONOUR SHE HAD DONE ME
AND ANGELS MIGHT HAVE BLUSHED AT THE REBUKE EXPRESSED IN HIS TONE AND EMPHASIS WHY DID YOU GO OFF FROM BARCHESTER SO SUDDENLY WHY DID YOU TAKE SUCH A STEP WITHOUT GIVING US NOTICE AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED AT THE PALACE
WHAT IS ELEANOR TO DO IF YOU THROW AWAY YOUR INCOME A HOT TEAR STOOD IN EACH OF THE WARDEN'S EYES AS HE LOOKED ROUND UPON HIS MARRIED DAUGHTER WHY SHOULD ONE SISTER WHO WAS SO RICH PREDICT POVERTY FOR ANOTHER
AND SO THE WARDEN RETIRED BUT AS HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM HE HEARD THE WELL KNOWN EJACULATION
IN THE TIME OF THE OLD LORD I HAD BEEN MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS IN HER SERVICE AND SHE PUT INTO MY HANDS A BEAUTIFUL WAISTCOAT OF WOOL THAT SHE HAD WORKED HERSELF TO KEEP ME WARM IN THE BITTER WINTER WEATHER
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR MY LADY WHO WITH PAIN AND TRAVAIL PRODUCED HER INTO THE WORLD CONSEQUENTLY IF WE BEGIN WITH MY LADY WE ARE PRETTY SURE OF BEGINNING FAR ENOUGH BACK AND THAT LET ME TELL YOU
AND I HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF JUDGING AS YOU SHALL PRESENTLY SEE
YOU HAVE HEARD OF BEAUTIFUL YOUNG LADIES FALLING IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT AND HAVE THOUGHT IT NATURAL ENOUGH BUT A HOUSEMAID OUT OF A REFORMATORY WITH A PLAIN FACE AND A DEFORMED SHOULDER FALLING IN LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT
AND YOU WILL NOT DO THIS RASH THING THE LADY WAS REALLY MOVED BEYOND HER USUAL CALM COMPOSURE IT CAN NEVER BE RASH TO DO RIGHT SAID HE I SHALL CERTAINLY
INSTEAD OF THAT I HAVE BEEN TELLING THE STORY OF MY OWN SELF CURIOUS AND QUITE BEYOND ME TO ACCOUNT FOR
SAID THE LADY THE ARCHDEACON TOOK ANOTHER TURN AND AGAIN EJACULATED GOOD HEAVENS THIS TIME IN A VERY LOW WHISPER BUT STILL AUDIBLE I THINK I'LL GO TO BED SAID THE WARDEN
A LITTLE BRIGHT OBJECT LYING ON THE CLEAN GRAVEL UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE MOON PICKING THE OBJECT UP I DISCOVERED IT WAS A SMALL BOTTLE CONTAINING A THICK SWEET SMELLING LIQUOR AS BLACK AS INK
I OFFERED SELINA GOBY A FEATHER BED AND FIFTY SHILLINGS TO BE OFF THE BARGAIN YOU WILL HARDLY BELIEVE IT BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS TRUE
UNDERSTANDING NOTHING MYSELF BUT THAT I WAS FREE TO PUT IT NEXT TO SELINA I WENT AND PUT IT ACCORDINGLY AND WHAT DID SELINA SAY
HOW DO YOU MEAN TO PAY THE MONSTROUS EXPENSES OF THIS ACTION MISSUS GRANTLY SUGGESTED THAT AS THE ACTION WAS ABANDONED THE COSTS WOULD NOT BE HEAVY INDEED THEY WILL MY DEAR CONTINUED HE
UNEASY IN MYSELF THE MOMENT SHE HAD SPOKEN THEM BUT SO IT WAS WE WILL CHANGE THE SUBJECT IF YOU PLEASE I AM SORRY I DRIFTED INTO WRITING ABOUT IT AND NOT WITHOUT REASON
EXPRESS DISAPPROBATION AND ASTONISHMENT WHAT WILL SIR ABRAHAM THINK OF IT
SAID THE WARDEN AND TO PREVENT THAT CONTINUED THE OTHER WE MUSTN'T LET ANY TALK OF RESIGNATION GET ABROAD BUT I SHALL RESIGN SAID THE WARDEN VERY VERY MEEKLY GOOD HEAVENS
IN THE CHARACTER OF LADY VERINDER'S HOUSE STEWARD ALL QUITE COMFORTABLE AND ALL THROUGH ROBINSON CRUSOE MY DAUGHTER PENELOPE HAS JUST LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER TO SEE WHAT I HAVE DONE SO FAR
EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WITH THE HOUSE WITH NOTHING TO DO THE VERY PLACE FOR HIM
OF COURSE CONTINUED THE OTHER SUCH A DECLARATION AS THAT YOU MADE TO SIR ABRAHAM MEANS NOTHING COME WARDEN PROMISE ME THIS THE WHOLE AFFAIR YOU SEE IS ALREADY SETTLED AND THAT WITH VERY LITTLE TROUBLE OR EXPENSE
HOW IT WAS I DON'T UNDERSTAND BUT WE ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE
TO THE DAY WHEN SHE RELIEVED HIM OF HIS LAST BREATH AND CLOSED HIS EYES FOR EVER I HAVE OMITTED TO STATE THAT I WENT WITH THE BRIDE TO THE BRIDE'S HUSBAND'S HOUSE AND LANDS DOWN HERE SIR JOHN SHE SAYS
AND SAYING I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT THE PERTURBATION IN MY MIND IN REGARD TO THINKING ABOUT IT BEING TRULY DREADFUL AFTER MY LADY HAD GONE AWAY I APPLIED THE REMEDY WHICH I HAVE NEVER YET FOUND TO FAIL ME
AND WENT ALL ROUND THE HOUSE AND THROUGH THE SHRUBBERY HAVING MADE SURE THAT NO PERSONS WERE LURKING ABOUT ANYWHERE IN OUR GROUNDS WE TURNED BACK PASSING OVER THE WALK WHERE I HAD SEEN THE SHADOW I NOW NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME
I SAID AND I THINK MY LADY IT WILL BE CHEAPER TO MARRY HER THAN TO KEEP HER MY LADY BURST OUT LAUGHING AND SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHICH TO BE MOST SHOCKED AT MY LANGUAGE OR MY PRINCIPLES SOME JOKE TICKLED HER I SUPPOSE
WAS ENTIRELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ONE OF MISTER FRANKLIN'S FREAKS BEING ASKED UPON THAT WHETHER HIS GALLOPING OFF AGAIN ON HORSEBACK WAS ANOTHER OF MISTER FRANKLIN'S FREAKS I SAID YES IT WAS AND SLIPPED OUT OF IT I THINK VERY CLEVERLY IN THAT WAY
CONTINUED THE REVEREND CROSS EXAMINER MISTER HARDING COULD NOT DENY THIS I'M SURE SIR ABRAHAM MUST HAVE ADVISED YOU TO CONSULT YOUR FRIENDS TO THIS PROPOSITION ALSO MISTER HARDING WAS OBLIGED TO ASSENT
AS SHE DID WHEN SHE WENT DOWN TO MEET MISTER FRANKLIN IN THE DRAWING ROOM THE FOOTMAN'S REPORT WAS THAT THE PRESERVATION OF A RESPECTFUL COMPOSURE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS BETTERS AND THE WAITING ON MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE AT DINNER WERE TWO OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO RECONCILE WITH EACH OTHER
THE ARCHDEACON THOUGHT HE KNEW HIS FATHER IN LAW BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD ALREADY TALKED OVER A VACILLATING MAN TO RESIGN HIS PROMISE COME SAID HE PROMISE SUSAN TO GIVE UP THIS IDEA OF RESIGNING THE WARDENSHIP
IT WAS SO SILENT OUT OF DOORS THAT I HEARD FROM TIME TO TIME VERY FAINT AND LOW THE FALL OF THE SEA AS THE GROUND SWELL HEAVED IT IN ON THE SAND BANK NEAR THE MOUTH OF OUR LITTLE BAY AS THE HOUSE STOOD THE TERRACE SIDE WAS THE DARK SIDE
AFTER THAT IT WAS ALL OVER WITH ME OF COURSE I GOT THE NEW COAT AS CHEAP AS I COULD AND I WENT THROUGH ALL THE REST OF IT AS CHEAP AS I COULD WE WERE NOT A HAPPY COUPLE AND NOT A MISERABLE COUPLE WE WERE SIX OF ONE AND HALF A DOZEN OF THE OTHER
WELL I HAVE DONE MY DUTY IF HE CHOOSES TO RUIN HIS CHILD I CANNOT HELP IT AND HE STOOD STILL AT THE FIRE PLACE AND LOOKED AT HIMSELF IN A DINGY MIRROR WHICH STOOD ON THE CHIMNEY PIECE
AND SCRIBBLING MISTER FRANKLIN'S NAME INSIDE HER WORKBOX SHE HAD BEEN SURPRISED AGAIN CRYING AND LOOKING AT HER DEFORMED SHOULDER IN THE GLASS HAD SHE AND MISTER FRANKLIN KNOWN ANYTHING OF EACH OTHER BEFORE TO DAY QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
THERE WAS PERHAPS A RAY OF COMFORT IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS MARRIED DAUGHTER THAT IS TO SAY OF COMPARATIVE COMFORT SEEING THAT HIS SON IN LAW WAS THERE
EVER FIND THEIR OWN SELVES GETTING IN THE WAY OF THEIR SUBJECTS LIKE ME IF THEY DO I CAN FEEL FOR THEM IN THE MEANTIME HERE IS ANOTHER FALSE START AND MORE WASTE OF GOOD WRITING PAPER WHAT'S TO BE DONE NOW
HE DID NOT IN THE LEAST DOUBT HIS RESOLUTION BUT HE GREATLY DOUBTED HIS POWER OF DEFENDING IT AGAINST HIS SON IN LAW YOU MUST BE VERY TIRED SUSAN SAID HE WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO GO TO BED
SO LONG AS MY MISTRESS AND I WERE TOGETHER SEEING THAT MY LADY TOOK AN INTEREST IN THE OUT OF DOOR WORK AND THE FARMS AND SUCH LIKE I TOOK AN INTEREST IN THEM TOO WITH ALL THE MORE REASON THAT I WAS A SMALL FARMER'S SEVENTH SON MYSELF
A SORT OF WHISPER
WAS NOT IN HIS MIND A MATTER OF ANY DOUBT HE KNEW HIS OWN WEAKNESS HE KNEW HOW PRONE HE WAS TO BE LED BUT HE WAS NOT WEAK ENOUGH TO GIVE WAY NOW TO GO BACK FROM THE POSITION TO WHICH HIS CONSCIENCE HAD DRIVEN HIM
THAT THE WAISTCOAT WAS NOT AN HONOUR BUT A BRIBE MY LADY HAD DISCOVERED THAT I WAS GETTING OLD
I WENT ON WITH MY BUSINESS AS BAILIFF YEAR AFTER YEAR UP TO CHRISTMAS EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN WHEN THERE CAME A CHANGE IN MY LIFE ON THAT DAY MY LADY INVITED HERSELF TO A CUP OF TEA ALONE WITH ME IN MY COTTAGE SHE REMARKED THAT
ISN'T IT ASKED THE WARDEN INNOCENTLY WELL AT ANY RATE I'VE DONE IT NOW SIR ABRAHAM DIDN'T SEEM TO THINK IT SO VERY STRANGE THE ARCHDEACON GAVE A SIGH THAT WOULD HAVE MOVED A MAN OF WAR
AND SEEING THEM SAFE THROUGH IT IN A MANNER MOST WONDERFUL AND PLEASANT TO HEAR THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOWS ON THE TERRACE AT NIGHT LATER STILL I WENT TO MISTER FRANKLIN IN THE SMOKING ROOM WITH THE SODA WATER AND BRANDY AND FOUND THAT MISS RACHEL HAD PUT THE DIAMOND CLEAN OUT OF HIS HEAD
BEING OLD AND SLY
HOWEVER UPSTAIRS HE WENT THE WAITER SLOWLY PRECEDING HIM AND ON THE DOOR BEING OPENED THE ARCHDEACON WAS DISCOVERED STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM ERECT INDEED AS USUAL BUT OH HOW SORROWFUL
IN THIS BUSINESS OF THE DIAMOND HE HAD THE LONGEST TONGUE AND THE SHORTEST TEMPER OF ANY MAN HIGH OR LOW I EVER MET WITH I SAY I WENT INTO THE SERVICE OF THE OLD LORD AS PAGE BOY IN WAITING ON THE THREE HONOURABLE YOUNG LADIES AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN YEARS
WITH A GENTLEMAN WHO COMES ON A VISIT TO HER MISTRESS'S HOUSE MATCH ME THAT IN THE WAY OF AN ABSURDITY OUT OF ANY STORY BOOK IN CHRISTENDOM IF YOU CAN I LAUGHED TILL THE TEARS ROLLED DOWN MY CHEEKS PENELOPE RESENTED MY MERRIMENT
WHEN I ENDEAVOURED TO LEAD THE CONVERSATION TO MORE SERIOUS THINGS TOWARDS MIDNIGHT I WENT ROUND THE HOUSE TO LOCK UP ACCOMPANIED BY MY SECOND IN COMMAND SAMUEL THE FOOTMAN AS USUAL
ASKED THE ARCHDEACON MISTER HARDING SIGNIFIED THAT HE HAD GOOD HEAVENS HOW UNFORTUNATE
HAVING GOT OVER MY DIFFICULTIES WITH THE LADIES I FOUND MORE DIFFICULTIES WAITING FOR ME WHEN I WENT BACK TO MY OWN ROOM IN CAME PENELOPE WITH THE NATURAL SWEETNESS OF WOMEN TO KISS AND MAKE IT UP AGAIN AND
I AGREE WITH THE LATE WILLIAM COBBETT ABOUT PICKING A WIFE SEE THAT SHE CHEWS HER FOOD WELL AND SETS HER FOOT DOWN FIRMLY ON THE GROUND WHEN SHE WALKS AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT SELINA GOBY WAS ALL RIGHT IN BOTH THESE RESPECTS
AGAINST THE INDIGNITY OF TAKING MY EASE AS I COULD BUT MY MISTRESS KNEW THE WEAK SIDE OF ME SHE PUT IT AS A FAVOUR TO HERSELF THE DISPUTE BETWEEN US ENDED AFTER THAT IN MY WIPING MY EYES LIKE AN OLD FOOL WITH MY NEW WOOLLEN WAISTCOAT
IF YOU REQUIRE TO BE TOLD THAT MY LITTLE PENELOPE WAS TAKEN CARE OF UNDER MY GOOD MISTRESS'S OWN EYE AND WAS SENT TO SCHOOL AND TAUGHT AND MADE A SHARP GIRL AND PROMOTED WHEN OLD ENOUGH TO BE MISS RACHEL'S OWN MAID AS FOR ME
PENSION HIM LIBERALLY AND LET GABRIEL BETTEREDGE HAVE HIS PLACE ON THE TUESDAY AS IT MIGHT BE SIR JOHN SAYS MY LADY THE BAILIFF IS PENSIONED LIBERALLY AND GABRIEL BETTEREDGE HAS GOT HIS PLACE
CHAPTER TWO I SPOKE OF MY LADY A LINE OR TWO BACK NOW THE DIAMOND COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN IN OUR HOUSE WHERE IT WAS LOST IF IT HAD NOT BEEN MADE A PRESENT OF TO MY LADY'S DAUGHTER AND MY LADY'S DAUGHTER
CAN BE IN ANY WAY BINDING ON YOU OF COURSE YOU WERE THERE TO ASK HIS ADVICE I'M SURE SIR ABRAHAM DID NOT ADVISE ANY SUCH STEP MISTER HARDING COULD NOT SAY THAT HE HAD I AM SURE HE DISADVISED YOU FROM IT
WITH A MOST POWERFUL SNEER COME ARCHDEACON SAID THE LADY
AND BEGAN TO DO SO BUT DOCTOR GRANTLY STOPPED HIM MY DEAR WARDEN SAID HE THIS IS ALL NONSENSE EIGHTY POUNDS OR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MAKES VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE YOU CAN'T LIVE ON IT YOU CAN'T RUIN ELEANOR'S PROSPECTS FOR EVER
WAITING FOR HIM AT HOME WAITING TO CONGRATULATE HIM ON THE END OF ALL HIS TROUBLE THINK OF ELEANOR PAPA SAID MISSUS GRANTLY I DO THINK OF HER SAID HER FATHER
WILL TAKE CARE OF ME ALSO SAID MISTER HARDING WITH A SMILE AS THOUGH AFRAID OF GIVING OFFENCE BY MAKING HIS REFERENCE TO SCRIPTURE TOO SOLEMN PISH SAID THE ARCHDEACON TURNING AWAY RAPIDLY
THAT IS MARRIED LIFE ACCORDING TO MY EXPERIENCE OF IT AFTER FIVE YEARS OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS ON THE STAIRS IT PLEASED AN ALL WISE PROVIDENCE TO RELIEVE US OF EACH OTHER BY TAKING MY WIFE
I MIGHT HAVE HAD A CHANCE OF CATCHING THEM BEFORE THEY GOT CLEAR OF OUR PREMISES AS IT WAS I WENT BACK TO SET A GOING A YOUNGER PAIR OF LEGS THAN MINE WITHOUT DISTURBING ANYBODY SAMUEL AND I GOT A COUPLE OF GUNS
AND HE GAVE HIS DAUGHTER A KISS AND SHOOK HANDS WITH THE DOCTOR AND AGAIN TRIED TO LOOK UNCONCERNED
AND OF COURSE I MUST NOW DO SO NOT AT ALL SAID THE ARCHDEACON CATCHING A RAY OF HOPE
THAT A STRANGE GENTLEMAN COULD POSSESS ANY INTEREST FOR HER
DESCRIBING IT MERELY AS A VALUABLE OF GREAT PRICE AND HE HAD GOT THE RECEIPT FOR IT SAFE IN HIS POCKET I WENT DOWN STAIRS
I SAID NOTHING TO SAMUEL BUT REMEMBERING WHAT PENELOPE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THE JUGGLERS AND THE POURING OF THE LITTLE POOL OF INK INTO THE PALM OF THE BOY'S HAND
BUT PAPA SAID MISSUS GRANTLY GETTING UP
SHE HAD BEEN MERRY WITHOUT REASON AND SAD WITHOUT REASON IN ONE BREATH SHE ASKED HUNDREDS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT MISTER FRANKLIN BLAKE AND IN ANOTHER BREATH
COULDN'T CHARGE FOR HER BOARD AND WOULD HAVE TO GIVE ME HER SERVICES FOR NOTHING THAT WAS THE POINT OF VIEW I LOOKED AT IT FROM ECONOMY WITH A DASH OF LOVE I PUT IT TO MY MISTRESS AS IN DUTY BOUND
ADVANCED WITH ARDOUR TO THE ASSAULT AND OFFICERS AND MEN VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN THE VALOUR WHICH THEY DISPLAYED IN VAIN DID THE GARRISON SHOWER ARROWS AND CROSS BOW BOLTS AMONG THEM AND POUR DOWN BURNING OIL AND QUICKLIME UPON THEM
WHO COMMANDED THE GARRISON OF VANNES SUPPORTED THE SIEGE WITH GREAT COURAGE AND FORTITUDE KNOWING THAT CHARLES OF BLOIS AND THE KING OF FRANCE WERE COLLECTING A GREAT ARMY FOR HIS RELIEF UNITING THEIR FORCES THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS THE TOWN
AS THEY FEARED TO CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY LEST THEY MIGHT FALL INTO THE HANDS OF SOME ROVING BAND OF FRENCH HORSE THEY WERE TOO DOG TIRED AND WERE ASLEEP A FEW MINUTES AFTER THEY LAY DOWN THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THEY AWOKE
AND THEIR ENCAMPMENT WAS FLOODED THEIR FORCES WERE THEREFORE OBLIGATED TO SPREAD THEMSELVES OVER THE NEIGHBOURING FIELDS AND A SUDDEN ATTACK BY THE ENGLISH MIGHT HAVE BEEN FATAL THUS DISTRESS PRESSED UPON BOTH COMMANDERS
AND WALKING ALL NIGHT ON AN EMPTY STOMACH IT DOES NOT SUIT ME AT ALL I FEEL RAVENOUS TOO RALPH
THEY WERE TO BE FOLLOWED BY A STRONG BODY OF MEN AT ARMS AS SOON AS THE GATES WERE OPENED A NUMBER OF ARCHERS ISSUED OUT AND TAKING THEIR PLACE AT THE EDGE OF THE MOAT POURED A RAIN OF ARROWS UPON THE MEN WORKING THE MACHINE AND THOSE GUARDING IT MOST OF THESE
WE SHALL EAT NOTHING TILL WE ARE WITHIN THE WALLS OF HENNEBON AND THAT WILL BE BY DAYLIGHT TOMORROW IF ALL GOES WELL DRAW YOUR BELT AN INCH OR TWO TIGHTER IT WILL HELP TO KEEP OUT THE WOLF
WHILE THE ENGLISH ARMY LAY ON A HILL THE FRENCH CAMP WAS PITCHED ON LOW GROUND AN UNUSUALLY WET SEASON HAD SET IN WITH BITTERLY COLD WIND THE RAIN WAS INCESSANT A PESTILENCE HAD DESTROYED A VAST NUMBER OF THEIR HORSES
THAT EVENING THERE WAS HIGH FEASTING IN THE TOWN ALTHOUGH THE CRASH OF THE HEAVY STONES CAST BY THE FRENCH MACHINES AGAINST THE WALLS NEVER CEASED EARLY THE NEXT MORNING SIR WALTER MANNY MADE A SURVEY OF THE PLACE AND OF THE DISPOSITION OF THE ENEMY
TO THE MAIN BODY OF THEIR FORCES THEY HAD PLACED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEIR BEST TROOPS ON THE WALLS GIVING THEM A HANDSOME LARGESS TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR LOSS OF THE FESTIVITIES
THEY FOUND THE WORK LESS ARDUOUS THAN THEY HAD EXPECTED THE ROPE WAS DRY AND THE STRANDS HELD TIGHTLY TO IT TWO OR THREE TIMES THEY CHANGED PLACES RESTING IN TURN FROM THE WORK BUT IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS FROM THE TIME THEY MADE THE FIRST LOOP WALTER'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS
IN A SHORT TIME THE FADING BRIGHTNESS OF THE CIRCLE OF LIGHT FAR OVERHEAD TOLD THEM THAT TWILIGHT HAD COMMENCED AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THEY ATTACHED THE FIRST STRAND TO THE ROPE SOME THREE FEET ABOVE THE WATER NOW WALTER SAID
THE KNIGHTS WHEELED AND PRESENTED A FIRM FACE TO THE ENEMY COVERING THE ENTRANCE OF THEIR FOLLOWERS INTO THE GATE THE FRENCH CHIVALRY THUNDERED DOWN UPON THE LITTLE BODY
MANNED THE BREACHES AND REPULSED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER ALL ATTEMPTS ON THE PART OF THE FRENCH TO CARRY THEM WHILE THE STRUGGLE WAS STILL GOING ON THE COUNTESS AIDED BY THE WIVES OF THE BURGHERS BUSIED HERSELF IN PREPARING A SUMPTUOUS FEAST IN HONOUR OF HER DELIVERERS
IF I GET TIRED I WILL FASTEN ANOTHER LOOP BY THE SIDE OF THAT ON WHICH I AM RESTING SO YOU CAN COME UP AND PASS ME THERE IS NO HURRY IT OUGHT NOT TO TAKE UP ABOVE AN HOUR
AND MANY ON BOTH SIDES WERE OVERTHROWN THEN AS LARGE REINFORCEMENTS WERE CONTINUALLY ARRIVING TO THE FRENCH SIR WALTER CALLED OFF HIS MEN AND RETIRED SLOWLY ON REACHING THE MOAT HE HALTED HIS FORCES
THEY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THEIR ASSAILANTS AND DASHED IN AT THE CASTLE GATE A CROWD OF THEIR ASSAILANTS WERE CLOSE UPON THEIR HEELS WALTER GLANCED ROUND DASHING ACROSS THE COURTYARD HE RAN THROUGH SOME PASSAGES INTO AN INNER YARD IN WHICH AS HE KNEW WAS THE WELL
I HAVE PREPARED FOR YOU AND YOUR KNIGHTS SUCH A BANQUET OF WELCOME AS OUR POOR MEANS WILL ALLOW AND MY TOWNSPEOPLE WILL SEE THAT GOOD FARE IS SET BEFORE YOUR SOLDIERS
THE WALLS CRUMBLED UNDER THE TREMENDOUS BLOWS AND ALTHOUGH THE ARCHERS HARASSED BY THEIR ARROWS THE MEN WORKING THEM THE FRENCH SPEEDILY ERECTED SCREENS WHICH SHELTERED THEM FROM THEIR FIRE THE SPIRITS OF THE DEFENDERS BEGAN TO SINK RAPIDLY
AND THE TWO PUTTING ON THE STEEL CAPS AND CLOAKS WALKED QUIETLY TO THE GATE THERE WERE NONE ON GUARD AND THEY ISSUED UNMOLESTED INTO THE TOWN
WHO WERE FAST APPROACHING THEIR SHIPS IMPELLED BY A STRONG AND FAVOURABLE BREEZE THE VESSELS OF THE FRENCH HASTILY DREW OFF AND THE ENGLISH FLEET SAILED INTO THE PORT HAILED BY THE CHEERS OF THE INHABITANTS THE COUNTESS HERSELF RECEIVED SIR WALTER MANNY
SOME TRIED IN VAIN TO GAIN SHELTER IN THE HOUSES SIR JOHN POWIS'S BAND WAS SOON BROKEN AND SCATTERED AND THEIR LEADER SLAIN BY A HEAVY STONE FROM A HOUSETOP WALTER FOUGHT HIS WAY BLINDLY FORWARD TOWARDS THE CASTLE
WHICH WILL LEAVE THREE OVER BUT WE HAD BETTER PLACE THEM A LITTLE OVER A YARD
EVERYONE IS INTENT ON HIS OWN PLEASURE AND WE SHALL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN SLIPPING OUT OF THE CASTLE UNNOTICED
WHO WERE NEVER TIRED OF LISTENING TO HIS TALES OF THE WARS
AS THEY SAW THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME GREAT BREACHES WOULD BE MADE IN THE WALLS AND THAT ALL THE HORRORS AND DISASTERS OF A CITY TAKEN BY ASSAULT AWAITED THEM THE BISHOP OF QUIMPER WHO WAS WITHIN THE WALLS ENTERED INTO SECRET NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIS NEPHEW
YOU ARE DOING WELL YOUNG SIR THE ENGLISH LEADER WENT ON AND HAVE DISTINGUISHED YOURSELF ON EACH OCCASION ON WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED I SHALL BE PROUD
AND THE CITY OF VANNES WAS TO BE GIVEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE CARDINALS TO DISPOSE OF AS THEY CHOSE IT WAS SPECIALLY PROVIDED
GATHERED AROUND HIM SOME OF THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN A LEADING PART IN THE INTRIGUE THESE LEAVING THE CITY BY A GATE AT WHICH THEY HAD PLACED SOME OF THEIR OWN FACTION TO OPEN IT TO THE FRENCH ISSUED OUT AND MADE THEIR WAY TO THE ASSAILANTS CAMP
WHO SUMMONED THE TOWN TO SURRENDER MANY STANDING ON THE WALLS SHOUTED THAT THE GATES SHOULD BE THROWN OPEN BUT SIR JOHN RETURNED FOR ANSWER THAT HE MUST CONSULT THE COUNTESS AND THAT UPON HER ANSWER MUST DEPEND WHETHER HE AND HIS MEN WOULD DEFEND THE BREACH UNTIL THE LAST
WHEN THE TIME COMES TO BESTOW UPON YOU MYSELF THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD IF OUR KING DOES NOT TAKE THE MATTER OFF MY HANDS A LITTLE LATER ROBERT OF ARTOIS DIED OF HIS WOUNDS AND DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE FAILURE OF HIS HOPES
BY WHICH IT WOULD NOT SLIP DOWN THE ROPE THEY MADE MANY FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS
WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY YOU KNOW WE WILL TAKE IT BY TURNS TO WATCH THAT LITTLE PATCH OF LIGHT OVERHEAD
THE SCANDAL AND DESOLATION WHICH THEIR RIVALRY CAUSED IN CHRISTENDOM THE WASTE OF NOBLE LIVES THE DEVASTATION OF ONCE HAPPY PROVINCES AND THE EFFUSION OF INNOCENT BLOOD GOING FROM CAMP TO CAMP THEY EXHORTED
WHO HAD GONE OVER TO THE ENEMY
THAN DROP DOWN INTO THE DEEP HOLE OF THAT WELL AND YOUR BRAINS SERVED YOU SHREWDLY IN DEVISING A METHOD OF ESCAPE WHAT SAY YOU GENTLEMEN ALL PRESENT JOINED IN EXPRESSIONS OF PRAISE AT THE LAD'S COOLNESS AND PRESENCE OF MIND
CUT DOWN ALL WHO OPPOSED THEM AND SETTING FIRE TO THE HUTS RETIRED TOWARDS THE CITY BY THIS TIME THE FRENCH WERE THOROUGHLY ALARMED AND NUMBERS OF KNIGHTS AND MEN AT ARMS DASHED AFTER THE LITTLE BODY OF ENGLISH CAVALRY
BESIDES THE GATES OF THE TOWN WILL STAND OPEN LATE FOR PEOPLE FROM THE VILLAGES ROUND WILL HAVE COME IN TO JOIN IN THE REVELS I AM READY TO TRY IT MASTER WALTER RALPH REPLIED FOR I ACHE FROM HEAD TO FOOT
BEFORE THAT TIME ELAPSED SOME FIFTY OR SIXTY PEOPLE ANXIOUS TO RETURN TO THEIR VILLAGES GATHERED ROUND THE GATE BEST LAY ASIDE YOUR STEEL CAP RALPH BEFORE WE JOIN THEM WALTER SAID IN THE DIM LIGHT OF THAT LAMP
EVERY HOUSE WAS CLOSED AND BARRED AND FROM THE UPPER WINDOWS THE BURGHERS HURLED DOWN STONES AND BRICKS UPON THE FUGITIVES WHILE PARTIES OF THE FRENCH SOLDIERS FELL UPON THEM FIERCELY MANY THREW DOWN THEIR ARMS AND CRIED FOR QUARTER BUT WERE INSTANTLY SLAIN
WHEN THEY HAVE SEARCHED THE CASTLE THOROUGHLY IT MAY OCCUR TO SOME OF THEM THAT WE HAVE JUMPED DOWN THE WELL BUT IT WILL BE NO PARTICULAR BUSINESS OF ANYONE TO LOOK FOR US AND THEY WILL ALL BE TOO ANXIOUS
IN A FEW DAYS THESE ARRIVED AND WERE SPEEDILY SET TO WORK AND IMMENSE MASSES OF STONE WERE HURLED AT THE WALLS WALTER CONTINUED TO ACT AS THE COUNTESS'S ESPECIAL SQUIRE SHE HAD INFORMED SIR WILLIAM CADDOUDAL
FOR WE MUST DIE HERE IF WE ARE NOT HAULED OUT I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T INTEND TO TRY AND CLIMB THAT ROPE I MIGHT DO TWENTY FEET OR SO ON A PINCH BUT I COULD NO MORE GET UP TO THE TOP THERE THAN I COULD FLY WE
CHAPTER TEN A PLACE OF REFUGE THE FRENCH EXCITED TO THE UTMOST BY THE EXHORTATIONS OF THEIR COMMANDERS AND BY THEIR DESIRE TO WIPE OUT THE DISGRACE
THE COUNTESS BEGGED FOR A LITTLE FURTHER DELAY BUT IN VAIN AND WITHDREW TO THE TURRET WHERE SHE HAD FOR SO MANY WEARY WEEKS WATCHED THE HORIZON IN HOPES OF SEEING THE SAILS OF THE APPROACHING FLEET WALTER WAS AT THE TIME WITH SIR JOHN POWIS ON THE WALLS
AND FORMED A LARGE ENTRENCHED CAMP NEAR THAT OF THE ENGLISH WHO THUS WHILE STILL BESIEGING VANNES WERE THEMSELVES ENCLOSED BY A VASTLY SUPERIOR FORCE THE KING OF FRANCE HIMSELF ARRIVED AT THE FRENCH CAMP THE FRENCH ALTHOUGH SO GREATLY SUPERIOR
THERE WERE SIX STRANDS AND EACH HAS MADE SIX PIECES SO WE HAVE THIRTY SIX I KNOW THE WELL IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET DEEP
IN OCTOBER KING EDWARD HIMSELF SET SAIL WITH A GREAT ARMY AND LANDING IN BRITTANY EARLY IN NOVEMBER MARCHED FORWARD THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND SOON REDUCED PLOERMEL MALESTRAIL REDON
AND THE GATES WERE SHUT INSTANTLY BEHIND THEM WALTER AND HIS COMRADE AT ONCE STARTED AT A BRISK PACE
AND I CANNOT KEEP OPENING AND CLOSING THE GATE
I WILL GO FIRST AT ANY RATE FOR A TIME I MUST PUT ONE LEG THROUGH THE LOOP AND SIT AS IT WERE WHILE I FASTEN THE ONE ABOVE AS I SHALL WANT BOTH HANDS FOR THE WORK YOU WILL FIND IT A GOOD DEAL EASIER TO STAND WITH YOUR FOOT IN THE LOOP
WHICH CRUISED OFF THE COAST AND CAPTURED ALL VESSELS ARRIVING WITH STORES AT THIS MOMENT TWO LEGATES
THE ARRIVAL OF THE REINFORCEMENTS AND THE PROOF OF SKILL AND VIGOUR GIVEN BY THE ENGLISH LEADER TOGETHER WITH THE TERROR CAUSED BY THE TERRIBLE EFFECT OF THE ENGLISH ARROWS SHOOK THE RESOLUTION OF DON LOUIS AND HIS TROOPS
AND HENNEBON OF COURSE REMAINED IN THEIR POSSESSION
AND AT THE PROSPECT OF THE WHOLESALE SLAUGHTER WHICH WOULD ATTEND A STORM WHEN ALL HOPE OF A SUCCESSFUL RESISTANCE WAS AT AN END I FEAR WALTER SIR JOHN SAID ONE MORNING THAT THE END IS AT HAND
AND AS SOON AS IT WAS DARK THEY RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL MASTER WALTER BUT I AM WELL NIGH FAMISHED IT IS THIRTY SIX HOURS SINCE I SWALLOWED A BIT OF FOOD
JUST AS THE FRENCH WERE MOVING TO THE ATTACK HARD BLOWS I DON'T MIND I HAVE BEEN USED TO IT BUT WHAT WITH FIGHTING AND BEING IN THE WATER FOR FIVE OR SIX HOURS AND CLIMBING UP THAT ENDLESS ROPE
WITH GREAT EFFORTS THEY MANAGED TO RID THEMSELVES OF THEIR ARMOUR AND THEN HELD ON WITH EASE TO THE ROPE THEY HAULED THE BUCKET TO THE SURFACE AND TIED A KNOT IN THE SLACK OF THE ROPE SO THAT THE BUCKET HUNG FOUR FEET BELOW THE LEVEL OF THE WATER
THEN THOUGH IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANYTHING THEY HEARD THE BUCKET LIFTED FROM THE WATER A MINUTE LATER IT FELL BACK AGAIN WITH A SPLASH
GAZING AS USUAL SEAWARD SUDDENLY THEY SAW HER THROW UP HER ARMS AND THEN TURNING TOWARDS THE CITY SHE CRIED AS SHE PERCEIVED THE ENGLISH KNIGHT I SEE THEM I SEE THEM THE ENGLISH FLEET ARE COMING RUN UP WALTER
AND WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TIE THESE TO THE ROPE IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT TO SLIP DOWN WITH OUR WEIGHT IF WE TIE THEM FOUR FEET APART
CHAPTER NINE THE SIEGE OF HENNEBON THE BESIEGERS OF HENNEBON WERE GREATLY DISCOURAGED AT THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE OF THE COUNTESS THEY HAD ALREADY ATTEMPTED SEVERAL DESPERATE ASSAULTS
THAT THEY COULD WITH DIFFICULTY DRAG THEIR LEGS ALONG UPON ENTERING THE TOWN WALTER MADE HIS WAY AT ONCE TO THE QUARTERS OF THE LEADER SIR WALTER HAD JUST RISEN AND WAS DELIGHTED AT THE SIGHT OF HIS ESQUIRE
IN THE DIRECTION OF HENNEBON THEIR CLOTHES SOON DRIED AND ELATED AT THEIR ESCAPE FROM DANGER THEY STRUGGLED ON BRISKLY WHEN MORNING BROKE THEY ENTERED A WOOD AND LAY THERE TILL EVENING
BUT HAD EACH TIME BEEN REPULSED WITH VERY HEAVY LOSS THEY NOW SENT TO RENNES FOR TWELVE OF THE IMMENSE MACHINES USED IN BATTERING WALLS WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND THERE ON A FALSE REPORT OF THE WEAKNESS OF HENNEBON
ON THE NINETEENTH OF JANUARY THIRTEEN FORTY THREE THE KING OF FRANCE DISMISSED HIS ARMY AND EDWARD SAILED FOR ENGLAND WITH THE GREATER PART OF HIS TROOPS THE COUNTESS OF MONTFORD AND HER SON ACCOMPANIED HIM AND THE POSSESSIONS OF HER HUSBAND IN BRITTANY
ON HIS LANDING AND THE TOWNSPEOPLE VIED WITH EACH OTHER IN OFFERING HOSPITALITY TO THE MEN AT ARMS AND ARCHERS AH SIR JOHN POWIS SIR WALTER EXCLAIMED WHAT
AND THE CARDINAL BISHOP OF TUSCULUM ARRIVED FROM THE POPE AND STROVE TO MEDIATE BETWEEN THE TWO SOVEREIGNS AND TO BRING ABOUT A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES POINTING OUT TO THEM
BRINGING WITH THEM ROBERT OF ARTOIS WHO IS GRIEVOUSLY WOUNDED
THE BISHOP HAS GAINED OVER THE WHOLE OF THEM BY HIS PROMISES THAT NONE SHALL BE MOLESTED IN PROPERTY OR ESTATE SHOULD THEY SURRENDER IT IS SAD TO SEE THE COUNTESS WALTER REPLIED SHE WHO HAS SHOWN SUCH HIGH SPIRIT THROUGHOUT THE SIEGE
NEARLY NINETY DAYS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE WE SAILED AND ALL HOPE OF HIS COMING IS GONE I POINT OUT TO THEM THAT CONTRARY WINDS HAVE BEEN BLOWING AND THAT AT ANY MOMENT HE MAY ARRIVE BUT THEY WILL NOT HEAR ME
KING EDWARD HOWEVER FELT THAT HIS POSITION WAS GROWING DESPERATE FOR STARVATION WAS STARING HIM IN THE FACE AND ONLY BY A VICTORY OVER AN IMMENSELY SUPERIOR FORCE IN A STRONGLY ENTRENCHED POSITION COULD HE EXTRICATE HIMSELF
PRESENTLY THE OFFICER CAME OUT FROM THE GUARD ROOM AGAIN THERE WAS A FORWARD MOVEMENT OF THE LITTLE CROWD AND WALTER AND RALPH CLOSED IN TO THEIR MIDST THE GATES WERE OPENED AND WITHOUT ANY QUESTION THE VILLAGERS PASSED OUT
HAVE MADE THEIR WAY HERE IN A FEW MINUTES A COLD CAPON SEVERAL MANCHETS OF BREAD AND A STOOP OF WINE WERE PLACED BEFORE WALTER WHILE RALPH'S WANTS WERE ATTENDED TO BELOW
YOU HAD BEST LIE DOWN BY THE FOOT OF THE WALL ANYONE WHO PASSES WILL THINK THAT YOU ARE IN A DRUNKEN SLEEP
WHO SHOT SUCH A STORM OF BOLTS THAT GREAT NUMBERS OF THE DEFENDERS WERE KILLED THE ASSAULT WAS MADE AT A SCORE OF DIFFERENT POINTS AND THE GARRISON WAS TOO WEAK TO DEFEND ALL WITH SUCCESS
NOW DOES NOTHING BUT WEEP FOR SHE KNOWS THAT WITH HER AND HER CHILD IN THE HANDS OF THE FRENCH THE CAUSE OF THE COUNT IS LOST IF SHE COULD CARRY OFF THE CHILD BY SEA SHE WOULD NOT SO MUCH CARE FOR THE FALL OF THE TOWN BUT THE FRENCH SHIPS LIE THICK ROUND THE PORT
MANY KNIGHTS WERE STRUCK THROUGH THE BARS OF THEIR VIZORS OR THE JOINTS OF THEIR MAIL THE HORSES THOUGH DEFENDED BY IRON TRAPPINGS
TO GIVE NEWS OF THE ALTERED SITUATION DON LOUIS AT ONCE ORDERED AN ATTACK TO BE MADE WITH HIS WHOLE FORCE IN HOPES OF CAPTURING THE PLACE BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE ENGLISH SUCCOUR BUT ANIMATED BY THEIR NEW HOPES THOSE SO LATELY DESPONDENT AND READY TO YIELD
THE VIBRATION OF THE ROPE WHEN OUR WEIGHT ONCE GETS ON IT MIGHT BE NOTICED BY ANYONE CROSSING THE COURTYARD DO YOU THINK WE HAVE SUFFICIENT BITS OF ROPE RALPH ASKED JUST ENOUGH I THINK WALTER REPLIED
AND ALL THAT I CAN SAY TO KEEP UP THEIR SPIRITS IS USELESS UPON OUR OWN LITTLE BAND WE CAN RELY BUT I DOUBT IF OUTSIDE THEM A SINGLE DETERMINED MAN IS TO BE FOUND IN THE TOWN IN VAIN DO I SPEAK OF THE ARRIVAL OF SIR WALTER MANNY
AND GROUPS OF MEN SAT ROUND THEM DRINKING AND SHOUTING MANY LAY ABOUT IN DRUNKEN SLEEP
THAT SOME FOOD BE PLACED BEFORE US OR WE SHALL HAVE ESCAPED FROM THE FRENCH ONLY TO DIE OF HUNGER HERE WE HAVE TASTED NOUGHT SINCE THE ATTACK ON VANNES BEGAN HAVE ANY BESIDE US ESCAPED
THE BUCKET HUNG AT THE WINDLASS CATCH HOLD RALPH HE EXCLAIMED
AND BY DINT OF UNBUCKLING THE CLOAKS AND ROLLING THEIR WEARERS GENTLY OVER WALTER SUCCEEDED AT LAST IN OBTAINING TWO OF THEM HE ALSO PICKED UP A SWORD FOR RALPH HIS OWN STILL HUNG IN ITS SHEATH AND THEN HE JOINED HIS COMPANION
WITH HOLDING ON TO THIS ROPE THE SOONER THE BETTER SAY I IN ANOTHER MINUTE BOTH STOOD IN THE COURTYARD IT WAS A RETIRED SPOT AND NONE WERE PASSING GOING ALONG THE PASSAGE THEY ISSUED INTO THE MAIN YARD HERE GREAT FIRES WERE BLAZING
AND THE REST OF THE PROVINCE IN THE VICINITY OF VANNES AND THEN LAID SIEGE TO THAT TOWN AS HIS FORCE WAS FAR MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR THE SIEGE THE EARLS OF NORFOLK AND WARWICK WERE DESPATCHED IN THE DIRECTION OF NANTES
I HAD GIVEN YOU UP FOR LOST WE THOUGHT YOU HAD GONE DOWN IN THE GALE THE NIGHT YOU STARTED WE WERE SEPARATED FROM THE FLEET SIR WALTER BUT THE MASTER HELD ON AND WE ARRIVED HERE FOUR DAYS AFTER WE PUT OUT WE TOOK PART IN THE SIEGE OF RENNES
SAVE OUR OWN LITTLE BAND NOT ONE IN THE TOWN WILL LIFT A SWORD AGAIN SUCH RESISTANCE AS WE CAN OFFER WILL BUT INFLAME THEM TO FURY AND ALL THE HORRORS OF A SACK WILL BE INFLICTED UPON THE INHABITANTS THERE SHE IS POOR LADY ON THE TURRET
THE TIME NOW FOR A WHILE PASSED VERY QUIETLY WALTER AND THE OTHER YOUNG SQUIRES PRACTISED DILIGENTLY UNDER THE INSTRUCTIONS OF SIR WALTER AT KNIGHTLY EXERCISES WALTER LEARNED TO BEAR HIMSELF WELL ON HORSEBACK AND TO TILT IN THE RING
THEN TURNING OFF FROM THE PRINCIPAL STREETS THEY MADE THEIR WAY BY QUIET LANES DOWN TO ONE OF THE GATES TO THEIR DISMAY THEY FOUND THAT THIS WAS CLOSED THE FRENCH COMMANDERS KNEW THAT SIR WALTER MANNY OR SALISBURY
WHO SEEING THAT SUCH POWERFUL AID HAD ARRIVED FOR THE CAUSE OF THE COUNTESS OF MONTFORD WERE EASILY PERSUADED TO CHANGE SIDES AMONG THEM WERE THE LORDS OF CLISSON
THE FIRST THING TO DO IS TO CUT OFF THE SLACK OF THE ROPE THERE ARE SOME TWELVE FEET OF IT THEN WE WILL UNWIND THE STRANDS OF THAT THERE ARE FIVE OR SIX LARGE STRANDS AS FAR AS I CAN FEEL WE WILL CUT THEM UP INTO LENGTHS OF ABOUT A COUPLE OF FEET
BEFORE THE FORCE OF THE FRENCH FORTY THOUSAND STRONG THE EARL OF NORFOLK HAD FALLEN BACK AND REJOINED THE KING BUT EVEN AFTER THIS JUNCTION THE FRENCH FORCES EXCEEDED THOSE OF EDWARD FOURFOLD THEY ADVANCED TOWARDS VANNES
TO RECONNOITRE THE COUNTRY AND CLEAR IT OF ANY SMALL BODIES OF THE ENEMY THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER IN THE MEANTIME EDWARD OPENED NEGOTIATIONS WITH MANY OF THE BRETON LORDS
SIR JOHN POWIS AND HIS PARTY REPULSED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE EFFORTS OF THE ASSAILANTS AGAINST THAT PART OF THE WALL ENTRUSTED TO THEM BUT AT OTHER POINTS THE FRENCH GAINED A FOOTING AND SWARMING UP RUSHED ALONG THE WALLS
UPON THE PART OF THE FRENCH HOWEVER CIRCUMSTANCES WERE OCCURRING WHICH RENDERED THEM ANXIOUS FOR A RELEASE FROM THEIR POSITION
NO RALPH SAID MUCH MORE CHEERFULLY
AND SIR JOHN POWIS THAT IT WAS AT HIS SUGGESTION THAT SHE HAD MADE THE SUDDEN ATTACK UPON THE FRENCH CAMP AND HE HAD GAINED GREAT CREDIT THEREBY THE EFFECT OF THE NEW MACHINES WAS SPEEDILY VISIBLE
THEY ARE SATISFIED THAT IF WE DID JUMP DOWN HERE WE ARE DROWNED AND NOW WE MUST THINK ABOUT CLIMBING UP AYE THAT WILL REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF THINKING RALPH GRUMBLED FOR SOME TIME THERE WAS SILENCE THEN WALTER SAID
AND PROPOSED TO HIS KNIGHTS TO SALLY FORTH AT ONCE AND DESTROY THE LARGEST OF THE ENEMY'S MACHINES WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP CLOSE TO THE WALLS IN A FEW MINUTES THE KNIGHTS WERE ARMED AND MOUNTED THREE HUNDRED KNIGHTS AND ESQUIRES WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE SORTIE
THEY ALONE REMAINED STEADFAST WHEN ALL OTHERS FELL AWAY AND IT IS DUE TO THEM THAT I AM STILL ABLE AS MISTRESS OF THIS TOWN TO GREET YOU ON YOUR ARRIVAL NEXT TO SIR JOHN HIMSELF
APPEARED ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE COURTYARD HE COULD HEAR SOUNDS OF SHOUTING AND SINGING WITHIN THE CASTLE AND KNEW THAT A GREAT FEAST WAS GOING ON DESCENDING A STEP OR TWO HE HELD PARLEY WITH RALPH
WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIS HUNGER THE YOUNG ESQUIRE RELATED HIS ADVENTURES TO SIR WALTER AND SEVERAL OTHER KNIGHTS AND NOBLES WHO HAD BY THIS TIME GATHERED IN THE ROOM IN FAITH MASTER SOMERS
AND SWIM TO THE SIDE WITHOUT MAKING THE LEAST NOISE THEY MAY GIVE A FEW TURNS OF THE WINDLASS TO SEE IF ANYONE HAS HOLD OF THE ROPE BELOW BE SURE YOU DO NOT MAKE THE SLIGHTEST SPLASHING OR NOISE FOR THE SOUND WOULD BE HEARD ABOVE
AND STOOD BY ME AND TO WHOSE SUGGESTIONS I OWE IT THAT I WAS ABLE AT THE FIRST TO SALLY OUT AND DESTROY THE FRENCH CAMP WHILE THEY WERE ATTACKING THE WALLS AND SO GREATLY HINDERED THEIR MEASURES AGAINST THE TOWN AND NOW SIR WILL YOU FOLLOW ME
WERE LEFT TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF HER PARTISANS WITH A SMALL BUT CHOICE BODY OF ENGLISH TROOPS THE TOWNS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO THEIR HANDS AND STILL REMAINED WERE BREST QUIMPER CORENTIN QUIMPERLE REDON
IF HE WOULD BRING OVER THE OTHER COMMANDERS AND NOBLES THE WILY BISHOP SET TO WORK AND THE CONSEQUENCES WERE SOON VISIBLE OPEN GRUMBLING BROKE FORTH AT THE HARDSHIPS WHICH WERE ENDURED
AND TO BE PROLONGED FROM THAT DAY FOR THE FULL TERM OF THREE YEARS IT WAS AGREED THAT THE TRUCE SHOULD EMBRACE NOT ONLY THE SOVEREIGNS BUT ALL THE ADHERENTS OF EACH OF THEM THE TRUCE WAS TO HOLD GOOD IN BRITTANY BETWEEN ALL PARTIES
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS WELL TO HAVE BEEN KILLED AT ONCE THEY ARE SURE TO FIND US HERE AND IF THEY DON'T WE SHALL DIE OF COLD BEFORE TOMORROW MORNING I DON'T THINK THEY WILL FIND US WALTER SAID CHEERFULLY
COME WITH ME WALTER HE SAID WE MUST FAIN PERSUADE THE COUNTESS IF SHE SAYS NO WE ENGLISHMEN WILL DIE IN THE BREACH BUT THOUGH READY TO GIVE MY LIFE FOR SO BRAVE A LADY I OWN THAT IT IS USELESS TO FIGHT LONGER
SLAYING ALL WHOM THEY ENCOUNTERED ALL IS LOST SIR JOHN EXCLAIMED LET US FALL BACK TO THE CASTLE AND DIE FIGHTING THERE DESCENDING FROM THE WALL THE PARTY MADE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE STREETS THE FRENCH WERE ALREADY IN THE TOWN
THE ENGLISH FLEET IS IN SIGHT MANY OTHERS HEARD THE SHOUT AND THE TIDINGS RAN LIKE LIGHTNING THROUGH THE TOWN IN WILD EXCITEMENT THE PEOPLE RAN TO THE BATTLEMENTS AND ROOFS AND WITH CHEERING
AND WAS NOW WITH THE BESIEGING ARMY THE BESIEGERS DELIGHTED TO FIND AN ALLY WITHIN THE WALLS WHO MIGHT SAVE THEM FROM THE HEAVY LOSSES WHICH AN ASSAULT WOULD ENTAIL UPON THEM AT ONCE EMBRACED HIS OFFERS AND PROMISED HIM A LARGE RECOMPENSE
AND HAVE SINCE DONE OUR BEST TO AID THE COUNTESS HERE AND THEIR BEST HAS BEEN MUCH THE COUNTESS SAID NOT TO SAY HOW BRAVELY THEY HAVE FOUGHT UPON THE WALLS IT IS TO SIR JOHN AND HIS LITTLE BAND THAT I OWE IT THAT THE TOWN WAS NOT SURRENDERED DAYS AGO
IT SLID DOWN THE ROPE WHEN THEIR WEIGHT WAS APPLIED TO IT AT LAST THEY SUCCEEDED IN FINDING OUT A KNOT WHICH WOULD HOLD THIS WAS DONE BY TYING A KNOT CLOSE TO ONE END OF A PIECE OF THE STRAND THEN SUFFICIENT WAS LEFT TO FORM THE LOOP
SIR JOHN EXCLAIMED MAYBE THE COUNTESS IS DISTRAUGHT WITH HER SORROWS WALTER DASHED UP TO THE TURRET AND LOOKING SEAWARD BEHELD RISING OVER THE HORIZON A NUMBER OF MASTS HURRAH SIR JOHN HE SHOUTED WE ARE SAVED
TO GET AT THE WINE BUTTS TO TROUBLE THEIR HEADS ABOUT THE MATTER BESIDES IT MUST BE A HEAVY JOB TO WIND UP THIS BUCKET AND IT IS NOT LIKELY THERE WILL BE SUCH URGENT NEED OF WATER THAT ANYONE WILL UNDERTAKE THE TASK
AND IT WILL NOT DO FOR US TO GET TO THE TOP UNTIL THE PLACE BECOMES A LITTLE QUIET TONIGHT THEY ARE SURE TO BE DRINKING AND FEASTING OVER THEIR VICTORY UNTIL LATE THEY NOW SET TO WORK AND STEP BY STEP MOUNTED THE ROPE
MY EXPENSES WERE VERY MODERATE ONLY I USED UP MY YEAR'S INCOME IN EIGHT MONTHS AND SPENT THE FOUR SUMMER MONTHS WITH MY FATHER WHICH PRACTICALLY GAVE ME TWELVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR AND IN ADDITION THE REPUTATION OF A GOOD SON
NO AT POINT DU JOUR WHERE WE HAD DINNER THE DUKE AND I
FOR TWO MONTHS WE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TO PARIS NO ONE CAME TO SEE US EXCEPT PRUDENCE AND JULIE DUPRAT OF WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU
THEN SHE SOMETIMES CAME TO DINE WITH ME ONE MORNING I DID NOT GO TILL EIGHT AND THERE CAME A DAY WHEN I DID NOT GO TILL TWELVE BUT SOONER THAN THE MORAL METAMORPHOSIS A PHYSICAL METAMORPHOSIS CAME ABOUT IN MARGUERITE
AND WHO HAD NO CONCERN WITH US ALONE WITH NATURE IN THE SPRING TIME OF THE YEAR THAT ANNUAL PARDON AND SHUT OFF FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY I COULD HIDE MY LOVE AND LOVE WITHOUT SHAME OR FEAR
WELL SAID MARGUERITE WELL I HAVE SEEN THE DUKE WHAT DID HE SAY THAT HE WOULD GLADLY FORGIVE YOU IN REGARD TO THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE
AFTER A BUTTERFLY OR A DRAGON FLY THIS COURTESAN WHO HAD COST MORE MONEY IN BOUQUETS THAN WOULD HAVE KEPT A WHOLE FAMILY IN COMFORT WOULD SOMETIMES SIT ON THE GRASS FOR AN HOUR EXAMINING THE SIMPLE FLOWER WHOSE NAME SHE BORE
BY DAY IN THE LITTLE WOOD THAT COVERED THE HILLSIDE IN THE EVENING SEATED ON THE GRASS AND I ASKED MYSELF IF EARTHLY CREATURES HAD EVER BEEN SO HAPPY AS WE SHOULD BE WHAT A PRETTY HOUSE MARGUERITE SAID TO ME
ASKING FOR A NOTE FOR A THOUSAND FRANCS PROFESSEDLY ON BEHALF OF MARGUERITE YOU KNOW I HAD WON SOME MONEY AT GAMBLING I THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY HANDED OVER TO PRUDENCE WHAT SHE ASKED FOR MARGUERITE
I HAD TAKEN HER CURE IN HAND AND THE POOR GIRL SEEING MY AIM OBEYED ME IN ORDER TO PROVE HER GRATITUDE I HAD SUCCEEDED WITHOUT EFFORT OR TROUBLE IN ALMOST ISOLATING HER FROM HER FORMER HABITS MY DOCTOR
SINCE THAT DAY HE HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF IN VAIN MARGUERITE DISMISSED HER GUESTS CHANGED HER WAY OF LIFE THE DUKE WAS NOT TO BE HEARD OF I WAS THE GAINER IN SO
THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL HER AND I HAD LISTENED AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM INTO WHICH THEY HAD SHUT THEMSELVES NOT LONG AFTER PRUDENCE RETURNED AGAIN I WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE GARDEN WHEN SHE ARRIVED AND SHE DID NOT SEE ME
I LOST ONLY WHAT I WAS ABLE TO PAY AND GAINED ONLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOSE FOR THE REST CHANCE WAS ON MY SIDE I MADE NO DEBTS AND I SPENT THREE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AS WHEN I DID NOT GAMBLE
A WEEK LATER MARGUERITE WAS SETTLED IN HER COUNTRY HOUSE AND I WAS INSTALLED AT POINT DU JOUR THEN BEGAN AN EXISTENCE WHICH I SHALL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN DESCRIBING TO YOU
AND OF HER UNITY AT THE CONTACT OF MEN AND THINGS AS FOR ME I EXPERIENCED THAT MORE THAN MOST MINE WAS NOT AN ORDINARY LOVE I WAS AS MUCH IN LOVE AS AN ORDINARY CREATURE COULD BE
MARGUERITE ROSE FROM TABLE AND JOINED THE DUKE IN THE NEXT ROOM WHERE SHE TRIED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO INDUCE HIM TO FORGET THE INCIDENT BUT THE OLD MAN WOUNDED IN HIS DIGNITY BORE HER A GRUDGE FOR IT
ASSUMED ALL AT ONCE AN APPEARANCE OF NOISE AND DISORDER NEVER BELIEVE HOWEVER DISINTERESTED THE LOVE OF A KEPT WOMAN MAY BE THAT IT WILL COST ONE NOTHING
I WILL DO WITHOUT IT BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO I DON'T IN THE LEAST KNOW PRUDENCE WAS NO DOUBT GOING TO MAKE SOME REPLY BUT I ENTERED SUDDENLY AND FLUNG MYSELF AT MARGUERITE'S FEET
WHICH IS VERY DISAGREEABLE DEBTS ARE CONTRACTED ACQUAINTANCES BEGUN ABOUT A GREEN TABLE END BY QUARRELS IN WHICH LIFE OR HONOUR COMES TO GRIEF AND THOUGH ONE MAY BE AN HONEST MAN ONE FINDS ONESELF RUINED BY VERY HONEST MEN
LET US GO AND SEE IF IT IS TO LET THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY AND TO LET FOR TWO THOUSAND FRANCS WOULD YOU BE HAPPY HERE SHE SAID TO ME AM I SURE OF COMING HERE
AND YOU REPLIED THAT I WOULD REPORT HIS DECISION TO YOU AND I PROMISED HIM THAT I WOULD BRING YOU INTO A MORE REASONABLE FRAME OF MIND ONLY THINK MY DEAR CHILD OF THE POSITION THAT YOU ARE LOSING
MARGUERITE WAS AWAKENED BY THE SUNLIGHT POURING INTO HER ROOM AND JUMPING OUT OF BED ASKED ME IF I WOULD TAKE HER INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE WHOLE DAY
AND COULD NOT FORGIVE HER HE SAID TO HER SOMEWHAT CRUELLY THAT HE WAS TIRED OF PAYING FOR THE FOLLIES OF A WOMAN WHO COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HIM TREATED WITH RESPECT UNDER HIS OWN ROOF AND HE WENT AWAY IN GREAT INDIGNATION
FOR THE MOST OF THEM GAMBLING WAS A NECESSITY FOR ME IT WAS A REMEDY FREE OF MARGUERITE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE OF GAMBLING THUS IN THE MIDST OF ALL THAT I PRESERVED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF SELF POSSESSION
AS PRUDENCE HAD TOLD US IT WAS THE REAL COUNTRY AND I MUST ADD IT WAS A REAL LUNCH IT IS NOT ONLY OUT OF GRATITUDE FOR THE HAPPINESS I OWE IT
AND THAT HAPPEN WHAT MIGHT SHE WOULD NOT SACRIFICE THE PLEASURE OF HAVING ME CONSTANTLY WITH HER ADDING THAT THOSE WHO WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS ARRANGEMENT WERE FREE TO STAY AWAY SO MUCH I HAD HEARD ONE DAY WHEN PRUDENCE HAD SAID TO MARGUERITE
CHAPTER SIXTEEN I MIGHT HAVE TOLD YOU OF THE BEGINNING OF THIS LIAISON IN A FEW LINES BUT I WANTED YOU TO SEE EVERY STEP BY WHICH WE CAME I TO AGREE TO WHATEVER MARGUERITE WISHED
HE HAS ASKED ME HOW I LOVING PARIS AS I DO COULD MAKE UP MY MIND TO BURY MYSELF IN THE COUNTRY I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS ILL AND THAT I WANTED REST HE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING ME
AND HAVING FALLEN UPON A PARTY OF FIFTEEN WHO WERE STILL AT LUNCH AT AN HOUR WHEN HE WAS PREPARED TO SIT DOWN TO DINNER HE HAD UNSUSPECTINGLY OPENED THE DINING ROOM DOOR AND HAD BEEN GREETED BY A BURST OF LAUGHTER
FAR THAT MY MISTRESS NOW BELONGED TO ME MORE COMPLETELY AND MY DREAM WAS AT LENGTH REALIZED MARGUERITE COULD NOT BE WITHOUT ME NOT CARING WHAT THE RESULT MIGHT BE SHE PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED OUR LIAISON
ARMAND ORDER AN OPEN CARRIAGE AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER WE WERE AT WIDOW ARNOULD'S PERHAPS YOU KNOW THE INN WHICH IS A HOTEL ON WEEK DAYS AND A TEA GARDEN ON SUNDAYS
WE BREATHED TOGETHER THAT TRUE LIFE WHICH NEITHER MARGUERITE NOR I HAD EVER KNOWN BEFORE HER DELIGHT IN THE SMALLEST THINGS WAS LIKE THAT OF A CHILD THERE WERE DAYS WHEN SHE RAN IN THE GARDEN LIKE A CHILD OF TEN
YES AN EXCELLENT IDEA I STAMMERED NOT KNOWING WHAT I WAS SAYING WELL I WILL ARRANGE THAT SAID MARGUERITE FREEING MY HAND AND INTERPRETING MY WORDS ACCORDING TO HER OWN DESIRE
WHILE GAMBLING GAVE A NEW TURN TO THE FEVER WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE PREYED UPON MY HEART AND FIXED IT UPON A PASSION WHICH LAID HOLD ON ME IN SPITE OF MYSELF UNTIL THE HOUR STRUCK WHEN I MIGHT GO TO MY MISTRESS THEN
AND WE SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING PERFECT THE DUKE IS GOING TO LOOK AFTER EVERY SINGLE THING AH MY DEAR SHE ADDED KISSING ME YOU'RE IN LUCK IT'S A MILLIONAIRE WHO MAKES YOUR BED FOR YOU
AND ALL THE SIMPLICITY OF ITS DEVELOPMENTS I REALIZED THEN THAT AS NOTHING IN THE WORLD WOULD MAKE ME FORGET MY MISTRESS IT WAS NEEDFUL FOR ME TO FIND SOME WAY OF MEETING THE EXPENSES INTO WHICH SHE DREW ME THEN TOO
THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT VIEW FROM THE GARDEN WHICH IS AT THE HEIGHT OF AN ORDINARY FIRST FLOOR ON THE LEFT THE AQUEDUCT OF MARLY CLOSES IN THE HORIZON
ALWAYS REPEATING THAT I WAS QUITE WELL AND THAT I WAS NOT IN NEED OF MONEY TWO THINGS WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD CONSOLE MY FATHER FOR MY DELAY IN PAYING HIM MY ANNUAL VISIT JUST THEN ONE FINE DAY IN SUMMER
MY DREAM VANISHED AT THE LAST WORDS OF PRUDENCE AND BROUGHT ME BACK TO REALITY SO BRUTALLY THAT I WAS STILL STUNNED WITH THE FALL
I PASSED WHOLE DAYS AT THE FEET OF MY MISTRESS WE OPENED THE WINDOWS UPON THE GARDEN AND AS WE WATCHED THE SUMMER RIPENING IN ITS FLOWERS
SAID SHE TURNING TO PRUDENCE AND SPEAKING IN A BROKEN VOICE YOU CAN REPORT THIS SCENE TO THE DUKE AND YOU CAN ADD THAT WE HAVE NO LONGER NEED OF HIM FROM THAT DAY FORTH THE DUKE WAS NEVER REFERRED TO
HAD ALMOST COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED AT THE END OF SIX WEEKS THE COUNT WAS ENTIRELY GIVEN UP AND ONLY THE DUKE OBLIGED ME TO CONCEAL MY LIAISON WITH MARGUERITE AND EVEN HE WAS SENT AWAY WHEN I WAS THERE
I WISHED ABOVE ALL NOT TO LEAVE MYSELF TIME TO THINK OVER THE POSITION I HAD ACCEPTED FOR IN SPITE OF MYSELF IT WAS A GREAT DISTRESS TO ME THUS MY LIFE GENERALLY SO CALM
MARGUERITE WAS DRESSED IN WHITE SHE LEANED ON MY ARM SAYING OVER TO ME AGAIN UNDER THE STARRY SKY THE WORDS SHE HAD SAID TO ME THE DAY BEFORE AND FAR OFF THE WORLD WENT ON ITS WAY
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I RECEIVED THIS NOTE
HE WOULD BRING HER BACK TO HIM BUT WHEN HE HAD PERCEIVED THE USELESSNESS OF THESE MEANS HE COULD HOLD OUT NO LONGER
I TOOK IT WAS I RIGHT I FLUNG MY ARMS AROUND HER NECK AND KISSED HER IT WILL BE CHARMING SHE CONTINUED YOU HAVE THE KEY OF THE LITTLE DOOR AND I HAVE PROMISED THE DUKE THE KEY OF THE FRONT DOOR
AND I WILL SAY GOOD BYE FOREVER TO THE LIFE FOR WHICH I NOW BLUSH YOU WON'T EVER REPROACH ME FOR THE PAST TELL ME TEARS CHOKED MY VOICE I COULD ONLY REPLY BY CLASPING MARGUERITE TO MY HEART WELL
AND BEHIND THE HOUSE A LITTLE WOOD FULL OF MYSTERIOUS RETREATS WHERE THE MOSS MUST EFFACE EACH MORNING THE PATHWAY THAT HAD BEEN MADE THE DAY BEFORE CLIMBING FLOWERS CLUNG ABOUT THE DOORWAY OF THIS UNINHABITED HOUSE
VERY MUCH IN NEED OF MONEY AND NOT POSSESSING THE FORTUNE NECESSARY FOR SUPPORTING THE LIFE THEY LEAD THEY GAMBLE THEN AND WITH THIS RESULT OR ELSE THEY GAIN AND THEN THOSE WHO LOSE SERVE TO PAY FOR THEIR HORSES AND MISTRESSES
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCEPT IT SAVE FROM ONE MAN LET ME ALONE BIG BABY AND SAY NOTHING THAT MEANS SAID PRUDENCE THAT WHEN I HAVE TWO DAYS FREE I WILL COME AND SPEND THEM WITH YOU
MARGUERITE GOT ACCUSTOMED TO THIS NEW EXISTENCE WHOSE SALUTARY EFFECTS SHE ALREADY REALIZED SHE BEGAN TO SPEND SOME OF HER EVENINGS AT HOME OR IF THE WEATHER WAS FINE SHE WRAPPED HERSELF IN A SHAWL PUT ON A VEIL AND WE WENT ON FOOT
AND WHEN SHALL YOU MOVE INTO THE HOUSE INQUIRED PRUDENCE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WILL YOU TAKE YOUR HORSES AND CARRIAGE I SHALL TAKE THE WHOLE HOUSE AND YOU CAN LOOK AFTER MY PLACE WHILE I AM AWAY
WE LEFT THE HOUSE AND STARTED ON OUR RETURN TO PARIS TALKING OVER THE NEW PLAN
ADD TO THIS THAT FROM THE PLACE WHERE I WAS I COULD SEE ON THE SHORE A CHARMING LITTLE HOUSE OF TWO STORIES WITH A SEMICIRCULAR RAILING THROUGH THE RAILING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE A GREEN LAWN SMOOTH AS VELVET
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SPEAK TO ARMAND MARGUERITE SEEMED TO BE THINKING FOR SHE ANSWERED NOTHING MY HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY WHILE I WAITED FOR HER REPLY NO SHE ANSWERED I WILL NOT LEAVE ARMAND
WHERE ASKED PRUDENCE YONDER AND MARGUERITE POINTED TO THE HOUSE IN QUESTION AH DELICIOUS REPLIED PRUDENCE DO YOU LIKE IT VERY MUCH
I FEARED ABOVE ALL THAT SHE MIGHT THINK ME CAPABLE OF SHIRKING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF EVERY CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HER LOVE FOR ME MIGHT LEAD HER IT THUS CAME ABOUT THAT THE DUKE RECEIVING NO REPLY CEASED TO WRITE
AND I HAD COME TO LIVE ENTIRELY AT HER HOUSE THE SERVANTS ADDRESSED ME OFFICIALLY AS THEIR MASTER PRUDENCE HAD STRICTLY SERMONIZED MARGUERITE IN REGARD TO HER NEW MANNER OF LIFE BUT SHE HAD REPLIED THAT SHE LOVED ME THAT SHE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT ME
MY FATHER WAS AND STILL IS RECEVEUR GENERAL AT C HE HAS A GREAT REPUTATION THERE FOR LOYALTY THANKS TO WHICH HE WAS ABLE TO FIND THE SECURITY WHICH HE NEEDED IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THIS POSITION
WELL IT IS ALL SETTLED SHE SAID AS SHE ENTERED THE HOUSE IS TAKEN ASKED PRUDENCE YES HE AGREED AT ONCE I DID NOT KNOW THE DUKE BUT I FELT ASHAMED OF DECEIVING HIM
UNDER THE PRETEXT THAT SHE WAS ASLEEP AND HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT SHE WAS NOT TO BE AWAKENED THE HABIT OR THE NEED OF SEEING ME WHICH MARGUERITE HAD NOW CONTRACTED HAD THIS GOOD RESULT THAT IT FORCED ME TO LEAVE THE GAMING TABLE JUST AT THE MOMENT
AND FOR WHOM ELSE SHOULD I BURY MYSELF HERE IF NOT FOR YOU WELL THEN MARGUERITE LET ME TAKE IT MYSELF YOU ARE MAD NOT ONLY IS IT UNNECESSARY BUT IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS
MARGUERITE WAS NO LONGER THE SAME WOMAN THAT I HAD KNOWN SHE AVOIDED EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT RECALL TO ME THE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN LEADING WHEN I FIRST MET HER NEVER DID WIFE OR SISTER SURROUND HUSBAND OR BROTHER WITH SUCH LOVING CARE AS SHE HAD FOR ME
BUT THAT IS NOT ALL CONTINUED MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE IS THERE I HAVE BEEN SEEING ABOUT A PLACE FOR ARMAND TO STAY IN THE SAME HOUSE ASKED PRUDENCE LAUGHING
THE NIGHTS THAT I DID NOT SPEND IN THE RUE D'ANTIN IF I HAD SPENT THEM ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM I COULD NOT HAVE SLEPT JEALOUSY WOULD HAVE KEPT ME AWAKE AND INFLAMED MY BLOOD AND MY THOUGHTS
AND BY THIS I KNEW THE VIOLENCE OF MY LOVE I LEFT THE TABLE WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION WHETHER I WAS WINNING OR LOSING PITYING THOSE WHOM I LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT LIKE ME FIND THEIR REAL HAPPINESS IN LEAVING IT
MOUNTING AS HIGH AS THE FIRST STORY I LOOKED AT THE HOUSE SO LONG THAT I BEGAN BY THINKING OF IT AS MINE SO PERFECTLY DID IT EMBODY THE DREAM THAT I WAS DREAMING I SAW MARGUERITE AND MYSELF THERE
MY LOVE FOR HER HAD SO DISTURBING AN INFLUENCE UPON ME THAT EVERY MOMENT I SPENT AWAY FROM MARGUERITE WAS LIKE A YEAR AND THAT I FELT THE NEED OF CONSUMING THESE MOMENTS IN THE FIRE OF SOME SORT OF PASSION
IF YOU HAVE BEEN IN LOVE YOU MUST HAVE FELT THE NEED OF ISOLATING FROM THIS WORLD THE BEING IN WHOM YOU WOULD LIVE WHOLLY IT SEEMS AS IF HOWEVER INDIFFERENT SHE MAY BE TO HER SURROUNDINGS THE WOMAN WHOM ONE LOVES LOSES SOMETHING OF HER PERFUME
IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT SHE READ MANON LESCAUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I FOUND HER SEVERAL TIMES MAKING NOTES IN THE BOOK AND SHE ALWAYS DECLARED THAT WHEN A WOMAN LOVES SHE CAN NOT DO AS MANON DID
AND FEARING LEST SHE SHOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN I POSSESSED I BORROWED AT PARIS A SUM EQUAL TO THAT WHICH I HAD ALREADY BORROWED AND PAID BACK I WAS THEN ONCE MORE IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WITHOUT RECKONING MY ALLOWANCE
WAS THAT MARGUERITE GAUTIER WHO ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO HAD BEEN THE TALK OF THE TOWN FOR THE LUXURY AND SCANDAL OF HER EXISTENCE ALAS WE MADE HASTE TO BE HAPPY AS IF WE KNEW THAT WE WERE NOT TO BE HAPPY LONG
WHERE THERE IS STILL A CERTAIN RIGOUR IN REGARD TO PAYMENTS ONE IS ALMOST CERTAIN THE MOMENT ONE GAINS A CONSIDERABLE SUM NOT TO RECEIVE IT YOU WILL READILY UNDERSTAND WHY GAMBLING IS ONLY LIKELY TO BE CARRIED ON BY YOUNG PEOPLE
WHOSE ONLY DEFECT IS THAT THEY HAVE NOT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR I NEED NOT TELL YOU OF THOSE WHO CHEAT AT PLAY
NO MORE BARRIERS MY MARGUERITE WE LOVE WHAT MATTERS ALL THE REST OH YES I LOVE YOU MY ARMAND SHE MURMURED PUTTING HER TWO ARMS AROUND MY NECK I LOVE YOU AS I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD EVER LOVE
AS FOR HER SHE CONTINUED TO LOVE ME AS MUCH OR EVEN MORE THAN EVER AS I TOLD YOU I BEGAN BY BEING ALLOWED TO STAY ONLY FROM MIDNIGHT TO SIX O'CLOCK THEN I WAS ASKED SOMETIMES TO A BOX IN THE THEATRE
COVERING HER HANDS WITH TEARS IN MY JOY AT BEING THUS LOVED MY LIFE IS YOURS MARGUERITE YOU NEED THIS MAN NO LONGER AM I NOT HERE SHALL I EVER LEAVE YOU AND CAN I EVER REPAY YOU FOR THE HAPPINESS THAT YOU GIVE ME
AS BEFORE NO MATTER ON WHAT CONDITIONS I READ THESE URGENT AND REPEATED LETTERS AND TORE THEM IN PIECES WITHOUT TELLING MARGUERITE WHAT THEY CONTAINED AND WITHOUT ADVISING HER TO SEE THE OLD MAN AGAIN
THOUGH I WAS HALF INCLINED TO SO MUCH DID I PITY HIM BUT I WAS AFRAID LEST IF I SO ADVISED HER SHE SHOULD THINK THAT I WISHED THE DUKE NOT MERELY TO COME AND SEE HER AGAIN BUT TO TAKE OVER THE EXPENSES OF THE HOUSE
PRUDENCE WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO SEEM MADE ON PURPOSE FOR DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WITH HER UNCHANGING GOOD HUMOUR AND HER ETERNAL APPETITE SHE NEVER LEFT A DULL MOMENT TO THOSE WHOM SHE WAS WITH AND WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY IN ORDERING EGGS CHERRIES MILK
AS NOT TO KNOW THAT I WAS LIVING THEM I BEGAN BY BORROWING FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND FRANCS ON MY LITTLE CAPITAL AND WITH THIS I TOOK TO GAMBLING SINCE GAMBLING HOUSES WERE DESTROYED GAMBLING GOES ON EVERYWHERE
THE SUN SHONE UPON MY MISTRESS AS IT MIGHT HAVE SHONE UPON THE PUREST BRIDE WE WALKED TOGETHER IN THOSE CHARMING SPOTS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON PURPOSE TO RECALL THE VERSES OF LAMARTINE OR TO SING THE MELODIES OF SCUDO
STEWED RABBIT AND ALL THE REST OF THE TRADITIONAL LUNCH IN THE COUNTRY WE HAD NOW ONLY TO DECIDE WHERE WE SHOULD GO IT WAS ONCE MORE PRUDENCE WHO SETTLED THE DIFFICULTY DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE REAL COUNTRY SHE ASKED YES
WE SENT FOR PRUDENCE AND ALL THREE SET OFF AFTER MARGUERITE HAD GIVEN NANINE ORDERS TO TELL THE DUKE THAT SHE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE FINE DAY
I CAME TO PARIS STUDIED LAW WAS CALLED TO THE BAR AND LIKE MANY OTHER YOUNG MEN PUT MY DIPLOMA IN MY POCKET AND LET MYSELF DRIFT AS ONE SO EASILY DOES IN PARIS
MARGUERITE TO BE UNABLE TO LIVE APART FROM ME IT WAS THE DAY AFTER THE EVENING WHEN SHE CAME TO SEE ME THAT I SENT HER MANON LESCAUT FROM THAT TIME SEEING THAT I COULD NOT CHANGE MY MISTRESS'S LIFE I CHANGED MY OWN
THE DUKE WROTE TO HER TWO OR THREE TIMES SHE RECOGNISED THE WRITING AND GAVE ME THE LETTERS WITHOUT READING THEM SOMETIMES THE TERMS OF THESE LETTERS BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES HE HAD IMAGINED THAT BY CLOSING HIS PURSE TO MARGUERITE
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN NEXT DAY MARGUERITE SENT ME AWAY VERY EARLY SAYING THAT THE DUKE WAS COMING AT AN EARLY HOUR AND PROMISING TO WRITE TO ME THE MOMENT HE WENT AND TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE EVENING
THE COURTESAN DISAPPEARED LITTLE BY LITTLE I HAD BY ME A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHOM I LOVED AND WHO LOVED ME AND WHO WAS CALLED MARGUERITE THE PAST HAD NO MORE REALITY AND THE FUTURE NO MORE CLOUDS
THE TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO JOIN MY FATHER AND SISTER HAD NOW ARRIVED AND I DID NOT GO BOTH OF THEM WROTE TO ME FREQUENTLY BEGGING ME TO COME TO THESE LETTERS I REPLIED AS BEST I COULD
HOWEVER MARGUERITE'S PLEASURE IN SEEING HER FRIENDS WAS A LITTLE MODERATED WHEN SHE SAW THE EXPENSE WHICH THAT PLEASURE ENTAILED AND ESPECIALLY THE NECESSITY SHE WAS SOMETIMES IN OF ASKING ME FOR MONEY THE DUKE
BE AT PRUDENCE'S TO NIGHT AT EIGHT
AND THAT ARMAND CAN NEVER GIVE YOU HE LOVES YOU WITH ALL HIS SOUL BUT HE HAS NO FORTUNE CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING YOUR NEEDS AND HE WILL BE BOUND TO LEAVE YOU ONE DAY WHEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE AND WHEN THE DUKE WILL REFUSE TO DO ANY MORE FOR YOU
FORMERLY WHEN ONE WENT TO FRASCATI ONE HAD THE CHANCE OF MAKING A FORTUNE ONE PLAYED AGAINST MONEY AND IF ONE LOST THERE WAS ALWAYS THE CONSOLATION OF SAYING THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE GAINED WHEREAS NOW EXCEPT IN THE CLUBS
WHEN AN ADROIT GAMBLER WOULD HAVE LEFT IT SETTLING ONE THING AGAINST ANOTHER I FOUND MYSELF IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS
NOTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE AS THEIR CAPRICES FLOWERS BOXES AT THE THEATRE SUPPERS DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WHICH ONE CAN NEVER REFUSE TO ONE'S MISTRESS AS I HAVE TOLD YOU I HAD LITTLE MONEY
WELL TELL THE DUKE TO TAKE IT FOR YOU HE WOULD DO SO I AM SURE I'LL SEE ABOUT IT IF YOU LIKE MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME
WHOM I HAD MADE HER MEET HAD TOLD ME THAT ONLY REST AND CALM COULD PRESERVE HER HEALTH SO THAT IN PLACE OF SUPPER AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS I SUCCEEDED IN SUBSTITUTING A HYGIENIC REGIME AND REGULAR SLEEP IN SPITE OF HERSELF
AND I WILL NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT I AM LIVING WITH HIM IT IS FOLLY NO DOUBT BUT I LOVE HIM WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO AND THEN NOW THAT HE HAS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE ALWAYS WITH ME
BEYOND DISTINCT IN THE SUNLIGHT RISE LITTLE WHITE HOUSES WITH RED ROOFS AND MANUFACTORIES WHICH AT THAT DISTANCE PUT AN ADMIRABLE FINISH TO THE LANDSCAPE BEYOND THAT PARIS IN THE MIST
PRUDENCE ON HER SIDE BROUGHT DOWN ALL THE PEOPLE SHE KNEW AND DID THE HONOURS OF THE HOUSE AS IF THE HOUSE BELONGED TO HER THE DUKE'S MONEY PAID FOR ALL THAT AS YOU MAY IMAGINE BUT FROM TIME TO TIME PRUDENCE CAME TO ME
FORGIVE ME IF I GIVE YOU ALL THESE DETAILS BUT YOU WILL SEE THAT THEY WERE THE CAUSE OF WHAT WAS TO FOLLOW WHAT I TELL YOU IS A TRUE AND SIMPLE STORY AND I LEAVE TO IT ALL THE NAIVETE OF ITS DETAILS
LIKE TWO CHILDREN IN THE DIM ALLEYS OF THE CHAMPS ELYSEES SHE WOULD COME IN TIRED TAKE A LIGHT SUPPER AND GO TO BED AFTER A LITTLE MUSIC OR READING WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN USED TO DO THE COUGH
AND THAT HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE THAT LET MARGUERITE LEAVE THE YOUNG MAN HE SAID TO ME AND AS IN THE PAST I WILL GIVE HER ALL THAT SHE REQUIRES IF NOT LET HER ASK NOTHING MORE FROM ME
ANY ONE WHO HAD SEEN US LEAVING THE HOUSE TO GO ON THE RIVER IN THE CHARMING LITTLE BOAT WHICH I HAD BOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE WEARING A STRAW HAT
THE BREEZE THE SHINING SOLITUDE OF FIELDS OR WOODS HOWEVER MUCH ONE LOVES A WOMAN WHATEVER CONFIDENCE ONE MAY HAVE IN HER WHATEVER CERTAINTY HER PAST MAY OFFER US AS TO HER FUTURE ONE IS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS JEALOUS
SHE WOULD WRITE TO ME IN THE MORNING THAT SHE WOULD DINE WITH ME NOT AT HOME BUT AT SOME RESTAURANT IN PARIS OR IN THE COUNTRY I WOULD CALL FOR HER AND WE WOULD DINE AND GO ON TO THE THEATRE OFTEN HAVING SUPPER AS WELL
MARGUERITE'S NATURE WAS VERY CAPRICIOUS AND LIKE SO MANY WOMEN SHE NEVER REGARDED AS A SERIOUS EXPENSE THOSE THOUSAND AND ONE DISTRACTIONS WHICH MADE UP HER LIFE SO WISHING TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH ME AS POSSIBLE
FOR THE REST NOT A PENNY OF DEBT THIS THEN WAS MY POSITION WHEN I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MARGUERITE YOU CAN WELL UNDERSTAND THAT IN SPITE OF MYSELF MY EXPENSES SOON INCREASED
I HAVE TRAVELLED A GOOD DEAL AND SEEN MUCH GRANDER THINGS
I FLUNG MYSELF INTO THIS RAPID NOISY AND VOLCANIC LIFE WHICH HAD FORMERLY TERRIFIED ME WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AND WHICH HAD BECOME FOR ME THE NECESSARY COMPLEMENT OF MY LOVE FOR MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE COULD I HAVE DONE
LET ME HAVE A SOLID ANSWER AND IN A GENTLEMANLIKE STYLE AND IT MAY HAVE THE EFFECT WHICH YOU SO MUCH DESIRE OF BRINGING ME OVER TO YOUR CHURCH
WHICH MAY BE CALLED ANNUAL AND CENTURY AVALANCHES WHICH STILL FURTHER ENRICH THE SCENERY THE ONLY PLACE ABOUT THE VALLEY WHERE ONE MAY BE SURE TO SEE THE ANNUAL KIND IS ON THE NORTH SLOPE OF CLOUDS REST
LEAPING OVER THE BROWS OF THE CLIFFS FROM GREAT HEIGHTS DESCENDING AT FIRST WITH REGULAR AVALANCHE SPEED UNTIL WORN INTO DUST BY FRICTION THEY FLOAT IN FRONT OF THE PRECIPICES LIKE IRISED CLOUDS
HE WAS DRUNK THEY SAID OR OUT OF HIS MIND WHEN HE WAS TURNED OFF
AND BURROWING MARMOTS MOUNTAIN BEAVERS WOOD RATS AND OTHER SMALL MOUNTAIN PEOPLE GO INTO WINTER QUARTERS SOME OF THEM NOT AGAIN TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY UNTIL THE GENERAL AWAKENING AND RESURRECTION OF THE SPRING
TO OBTAIN FROM THE PARLIAMENT A REPEAL OF THE ACTS WHICH IMPOSED CIVIL DISABILITIES ON THOSE WHO PROFESSED HIS RELIGION BUT IF HE ATTEMPTED TO SUBDUE THE PROTESTANT FEELING OF ENGLAND BY RUDE MEANS
IN THAT THEY WERE IMPLACABLE ENEMIES OF THAT GOOD CAUSE WHICH WOULD YET REVIVE AND FLOURISH SHE LEFT THEM TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE KING OF KINGS TO THE LAST SHE PRESERVED A TRANQUIL COURAGE WHICH REMINDED THE SPECTATORS OF THE MOST HEROIC DEATHS
BORDERING ON HIGH TREASON FROM HIS INDICTMENT AND FROM THE SCANTY ACCOUNT WHICH REMAINS OF HIS TRIAL IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT HE WAS NOT EVEN ACCUSED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE DESIGN OF MURDERING THE ROYAL BROTHERS THE MALIGNITY WITH WHICH SO OBSCURE A MAN
ON NO PART OF THE RUSH WAS I BURIED I WAS ONLY MODERATELY IMBEDDED ON THE SURFACE OR AT TIMES A LITTLE BELOW IT AND COVERED WITH A VEIL OF BACK STREAMING DUST PARTICLES
FOR THE MEMORY OF HIS DECEASED MASTER THIS PLEA THE KING CONSIDERED AS THE SUBTERFUGE
BOTH WERE IMPELLED BY THE STRONGEST PRESSURE OF HOPE END FEAR TO CRIMINATE HIM EVIDENCE WAS PRODUCED
THE PAPISTS CLAIMED THE DECEASED PRINCE AS THEIR PROSELYTE THE WHIGS EXECRATED HIM AS A HYPOCRITE AND A RENEGADE THE TORIES REGARDED THE REPORT OF HIS APOSTASY
THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY A CRUEL EXPERIENCE THAT THE ANTIPATHY OF THE NATION TO THEIR RELIGION WAS NOT A FANCY WHICH WOULD YIELD TO THE MANDATE OF A PRINCE BUT A PROFOUND SENTIMENT
BESIDES THESE COMMON AFTER STORM AVALANCHES THAT ARE TO BE FOUND NOT ONLY IN THE YOSEMITE BUT IN ALL THE DEEP SHEER WALLED CANYON OF THE RANGE THERE ARE TWO OTHER IMPORTANT KINDS
THE AVERAGE DEPTH ACTUALLY FOUND AT ANY TIME SELDOM EXCEEDS TEN FEET IN THE FOREST REGIONS OR FIFTEEN FEET ALONG THE SLOPES OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS AFTER SNOW STORMS COME AVALANCHES
BEGINNING TO RISE TOWARDS SUNDOWN JUST WHEN THE STREAMS ON THE FOUNTAINS ARE BEGINNING TO DIMINISH THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME OF THE DAILY RISE AND FALL BEING CAUSED BY THE DISTANCE THE UPPER FLOOD STREAMS HAVE TO TRAVEL BEFORE REACHING THE VALLEY
I KNEW THE CLIMB WOULD REQUIRE A LONG TIME SOME THREE OR FOUR HOURS AS I ESTIMATED BUT IT PROVED FAR MORE DIFFICULT THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED MOST OF THE WAY I SANK WAIST DEEP
THE GOVERNMENT WAS BENT ON DESTROYING A VICTIM OF NO HIGH RANK A SURGEON IN THE CITY NAMED BATEMAN HE HAD ATTENDED SHAFTESBURY PROFESSIONALLY AND HAD BEEN A ZEALOUS EXCLUSIONIST
AND IT WAS A POPULAR SAYING THAT THEY FISHED FOR PREY LIKE TAME CORMORANTS WITH ROPES ROUND THEIR NECKS THE PRISONER STUPEFIED BY ILLNESS WAS UNABLE TO ARTICULATE OR TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PASSED HIS SON AND DAUGHTER
WAS A MAN NAMED JAMES BURTON BY HIS OWN CONFESSION HE HAD BEEN PRESENT WHEN THE DESIGN OF ASSASSINATION WAS DISCUSSED BY HIS ACCOMPLICES WHEN THE CONSPIRACY WAS DETECTED A REWARD WAS OFFERED FOR HIS APPREHENSION
AND HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF RECEIVING THE EUCHARIST FROM THE BISHOPS OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH THOSE PROTESTANTS WHO HAD STOOD BY HIM IN HIS DIFFICULTIES AND WHO STILL CHERISHED AN AFFECTIONATE REMEMBRANCE OF HIM
COMPELLING HUGE SLEEPING BOULDERS TO WAKE UP AND JOIN IN THEIR DANCE AND SONG TO SWELL THEIR EXULTING CHORUS IN EARLY SUMMER AFTER THE FLOOD SEASON THE YOSEMITE STREAMS ARE IN THEIR PRIME
CHAPTER THREE SNOW STORMS AS HAS BEEN ALREADY STATED THE FIRST OF THE GREAT SNOW STORMS THAT REPLENISH THE YOSEMITE FOUNTAINS
AT LENGTH ALL THEIR PLANS PERFECTED TUFTED FLAKES AND SINGLE STARRY CRYSTALS COME IN SIGHT SOLEMNLY SWIRLING AND GLINTING TO THEIR BLESSED APPOINTED PLACES
NONE WHO FELT THUS COULD HAVE WATCHED WITHOUT DEEP CONCERN AND GLOOMY FOREBODINGS THE DISPUTE BETWEEN THE KING AND THE PARLIAMENT ON THE SUBJECT OF THE TEST
OF OBTAINING AT ONCE GREATNESS AND REVENGE BUT NEITHER FANATICISM NOR AMBITION NEITHER RESENTMENT FOR PAST WRONGS NOR THE INTOXICATION PRODUCED BY SUDDEN GOOD FORTUNE
THE GROWTH OF FIVE GENERATIONS DIFFUSED THROUGH ALL RANKS AND PARTIES AND INTERTWINED NOT LESS CLOSELY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE TORY THAN WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WHIG
AND WAS BROUGHT ALTOGETHER UNPREPARED TO THE BAR OF THE OLD BAILEY THE CASE AGAINST HIM RESTED WHOLLY ON THE EVIDENCE OF RUMSEY AND GOODENOUGH BOTH WERE BY THEIR OWN CONFESSION ACCOMPLICES IN THE PLOT WITH WHICH THEY CHARGED THE PRISONER
BUT JAMES SUPPOSED THAT THE PRIMATE WAS STRUCK DUMB BY THE IRRESISTIBLE FORCE OF REASON AND EAGERLY CHALLENGED HIS GRACE TO PRODUCE WITH THE HELP OF THE WHOLE EPISCOPAL BENCH A SATISFACTORY REPLY
RUMSEY'S STORY WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THE STORY WHICH HE HAD TOLD WHEN HE APPEARED AS A WITNESS AGAINST LORD RUSSELL BUT THESE THINGS WERE URGED IN VAIN ON THE BENCH SATE THREE JUDGES WHO HAD BEEN WITH JEFFREYS IN THE WEST
OF WHICH THEY HAD READ IN FOX WILLIAM PENN FOR WHOM EXHIBITIONS WHICH HUMANE MEN GENERALLY AVOID SEEM TO HAVE HAD A STRONG ATTRACTION HASTENED FROM CHEAPSIDE
AND ALL THE LANDSCAPE IS GLOWING LIKE A BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE THEN THE STREAMS ARE AT THEIR LOWEST EBB WITH SCARCE A MEMORY LEFT OF THEIR WILD SPRING FLOODS
PROTECTED BY ENTAIL AGAINST FORFEITURE IN THE CASE OF GREY AND OF MEN SITUATED LIKE HIM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GRATIFY CRUELTY AND RAPACITY AT ONCE BUT A RICH TRADER MIGHT BE BOTH HANGED AND PLUNDERED
AND IT WAS REMARKED BY THOSE WHO WATCHED THEIR DEPORTMENT THAT THEY HAD COME BACK FROM THE CARNAGE OF TAUNTON IN A FIERCE AND EXCITED STATE IT IS INDEED BUT TOO TRUE THAT THE TASTE FOR BLOOD
THE GIBBET WAS SET UP WHERE KING STREET MEETS CHEAPSIDE IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE WHERE HE HAD LONG LIVED IN GENERAL RESPECT OF THE EXCHANGE WHERE HIS CREDIT HAD ALWAYS STOOD HIGH AND OF THE GUILDHALL WHERE HE HAD DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF AS A POPULAR LEADER
THE COMMERCIAL GRANDEES HOWEVER THOUGH IN GENERAL HOSTILE TO POPERY AND TO ARBITRARY POWER HAD YET BEEN TOO SCRUPULOUS OR TOO TIMID TO INCUR THE GUILT OF HIGH TREASON ONE OF THE MOST CONSIDERABLE AMONG THEM
WHATEVER CONFLICTS THEREFORE THE HONEST CAVALIER MIGHT HAVE HAD TO MAINTAIN AGAINST WHIGS AND ROUNDHEADS HE HAD AT LEAST BEEN HITHERTO UNDISTURBED BY CONFLICT IN HIS OWN MIND
HE HAD SEEN THE PATH OF DUTY PLAIN BEFORE HIM THROUGH GOOD AND EVIL HE WAS TO BE TRUE TO CHURCH AND KING BUT IF THOSE TWO AUGUST AND VENERABLE POWERS
AND APPEARED TO BE IN HIS HANDWRITING THESE PAPERS JAMES SHOWED TRIUMPHANTLY TO SEVERAL PROTESTANTS AND DECLARED THAT TO HIS KNOWLEDGE HIS BROTHER HAD LIVED AND DIED
WITH THESE DISTINGUISHED LEADERS ALL THE NOBLEST AND MOST OPULENT MEMBERS OF THEIR CHURCH CONCURRED EXCEPT LORD ARUNDELL OF WARDOUR AN OLD MAN
HAD BEEN THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAD FORMED A CORRECT JUDGMENT OF HIS CHARACTER EVEN LEWIS UNDERSTOOD ENOUGH OF THE STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING IN ENGLAND TO BE AWARE THAT THE DIVULGING OF THE TRUTH MIGHT DO HARM
AND HAD OF HIS OWN ACCORD
THE OPPRESSED PURITANS RECKONED UP NOT WITHOUT A GLOOMY SATISFACTION THE HOUSES WHICH HAD BEEN BLOWN DOWN AND THE SHIPS WHICH HAD BEEN CAST AWAY AND DERIVED SOME CONSOLATION FROM THINKING THAT HEAVEN WAS BEARING AWFUL TESTIMONY
AND CONTAINED NOTHING WHICH HAD NOT IN THE OPINION OF ALL PROTESTANT DIVINES BEEN TEN THOUSAND TIMES REFUTED IN HIS IGNORANT EXULTATION
STORM SUCCEEDS STORM HEAPING SNOW ON SNOW UNTIL THIRTY TO FIFTY FEET HAS FALLEN BUT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS SETTLING AND COMPACTING AND WASTE FROM MELTING AND EVAPORATION
STOOD BY HIM AT THE BAR THEY READ AS WELL AS THEY COULD SOME NOTES WHICH HE HAD SET DOWN AND EXAMINED HIS WITNESSES IT WAS TO LITTLE PURPOSE
WHERE UNDER ORDINARY WEATHER CONDITIONS THE SNOW ACCUMULATED FROM WINTER TO WINTER LIES AT REST FOR MANY YEARS ALLOWING TREES FIFTY TO A HUNDRED FEET HIGH TO GROW UNDISTURBED ON THE SLOPES BENEATH THEM
IT WAS INDEED IN THE POWER OF THE KING BY THE EXERCISE OF HIS PREROGATIVE OF MERCY TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF THE PENAL LAWS IT MIGHT HEREAFTER BE IN HIS POWER BY DISCREET MANAGEMENT
AVALANCHES ARE SHORT LIVED FEW OF THEM LASTING MORE THAN A MINUTE OR TWO AND THE SHARP CLASHING SOUNDS SO COMMON IN FALLING WATER ARE MOSTLY WANTING
RUNNING AND SINGING SOON AFTER SUNRISE LOUDER AND LOUDER WITH INCREASING VOLUME UNTIL SUNDOWN THEN THEY GRADUALLY FAIL THROUGH THE FROSTY HOURS OF THE NIGHT
AT THE PORCHES OF ITALIAN CONVENTS SUCH WAS THE FEELING OF WILLIAM HERBERT EARL OF POWIS WHO WAS GENERALLY REGARDED AS THE CHIEF OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC ARISTOCRACY
HE WAS SAVED FROM DEATH BY AN ANCIENT MATRON OF THE BAPTIST PERSUASION NAMED ELIZABETH GAUNT THIS WOMAN
AND SOON THE BUSY THRONG FILLS THE SKY AND MAKES DARKNESS LIKE NIGHT THE FIRST HEAVY FALL IS USUALLY FROM ABOUT TWO TO FOUR FEET IN DEPTH THEN WITH INTERVALS OF DAYS OR WEEKS OF BRIGHT WEATHER
THEN THE DENSE MASSES ON THE ENDS OF THE LEAFY BRANCHES BEGIN TO SHIFT AND FALL THOSE FROM THE UPPER BRANCHES STRIKING THE LOWER ONES IN SUCCESSION ENVELOPING EACH TREE IN A HOLLOW CONICAL AVALANCHE OF FAIRY FINENESS
HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE DOCUMENTS TO WHICH HE ATTACHED SO MUCH VALUE MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMPOSED BY ANY LAD OF FIFTEEN
THE GREAT CENTURY AVALANCHES AND THE KIND THAT MOW WIDE SWATHS THROUGH THE UPPER FORESTS OCCUR ON MOUNTAIN SIDES ABOUT TEN OR TWELVE THOUSAND FEET HIGH
AFTER ALL THE AVALANCHES ARE DOWN AND THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST THEN ALL THE YOSEMITE STREAMS FROM THEIR FOUNTAINS TO THEIR FALLS SING THEIR GRANDEST SONGS COUNTLESS RILLS MAKE HASTE TO THE RIVERS
LEAPING FROM BENCH TO BENCH SPREADING AND NARROWING AND THROWING OFF CLOUDS OF WHIRLING DUST LIKE THE SPRAY OF FOAMING CATARACTS COMPARED WITH WATERFALLS AND CASCADES
WAS HENRY CORNISH HE HAD BEEN AN ALDERMAN UNDER THE OLD CHARTER OF THE CITY AND HAD FILLED THE OFFICE OF SHERIFF WHEN THE QUESTION OF THE EXCLUSION BILL OCCUPIED THE PUBLIC MIND IN POLITICS HE WAS A WHIG
HAD THE HEART AND THE FOREHEAD TO APPEAR AS THE PRINCIPAL WITNESS AGAINST THEM THEY WERE CONVICTED FERNLEY WAS SENTENCED TO THE GALLOWS ELIZABETH GAUNT TO THE STAKE EVEN AFTER ALL THE HORRORS OF THAT YEAR
SUSPECTED AND WHISPERED BUT NOT FORMALLY ANNOUNCED THE DISCLOSURE INDEED COULD NOT BE MADE WITHOUT GREAT SCANDAL CHARLES HAD TIMES WITHOUT NUMBER DECLARED HIMSELF A PROTESTANT
THEN AWAY IN GRAND STYLE GO THE PONDEROUS ICY MASSES WITHOUT ANY FINE SNOW DUST THOSE OF CLOUDS REST DESCEND LIKE THUNDERBOLTS FOR MORE THAN A MILE
WHERE THE SLOPES ARE INCLINED AT AN ANGLE TOO LOW TO SHED OFF THE DRY WINTER SNOW AND WHICH ACCUMULATES UNTIL THE SPRING THAWS SAP THEIR FOUNDATIONS AND MAKE THEM SLIPPERY
AND HIS ZEAL FOR THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION HAD GROWN UP TOGETHER AND HAD STRENGTHENED EACH OTHER IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIM THAT THE TWO SENTIMENTS WHICH SEEMED INSEPARABLE AND EVEN IDENTICAL
I THREW MYSELF ON MY BACK AND SPREAD MY ARMS TO TRY TO KEEP FROM SINKING FORTUNATELY THOUGH THE GRADE OF THE CANYON IS VERY STEEP IT IS NOT INTERRUPTED BY PRECIPICES LARGE ENOUGH TO CAUSE OUTBOUNDING OR FREE PLUNGING
MANY THOUGHT IT IMPOSSIBLE THAT THESE JUDGMENTS SHOULD BE CARRIED INTO EXECUTION BUT THE KING WAS WITHOUT PITY FERNLEY WAS HANGED ELIZABETH GAUNT WAS BURNED ALIVE AT TYBURN ON THE SAME DAY ON WHICH CORNISH
BEEN ONE CHARLES THE FIRST WAS REGARDED BY THE CHURCH AS HER MARTYR IF CHARLES THE SECOND HAD PLOTTED AGAINST HER HE HAD PLOTTED IN SECRET IN PUBLIC HE HAD EVER PROFESSED HIMSELF
AND IN THE MAIN CANYONS FLOWING IN REGULAR CHANNELS AND BOOMING LIKE WATERFALLS WHILE COUNTLESS SMALLER ONES FALL EVERYWHERE FROM LADEN TREES AND ROCKS AND LOFTY CANYON WALLS
SUCH WERE THE SENTIMENTS OF THE KING'S TWO KINSMEN THE EARLS OF CLARENDON AND ROCHESTER THE POWER AND FAVOUR OF THESE NOBLEMEN SEEMED TO BE GREAT INDEED
GUILTY OF SO SLIGHT AN OFFENCE WAS HUNTED DOWN WHILE TRAITORS FAR MORE CRIMINAL AND FAR MORE EMINENT WERE ALLOWED TO RANSOM THEMSELVES BY GIVING EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM SEEMED TO REQUIRE EXPLANATION AND A DISGRACEFUL EXPLANATION WAS FOUND
HE MAY POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN PRIVY TO THE WHIG PLOT BUT IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN ONE OF THE LEADING CONSPIRATORS FOR IN THE GREAT MASS OF DEPOSITIONS PUBLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT HIS NAME OCCURS ONLY ONCE AND THEN NOT IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CRIME
AND OF THE TYRANNY OF HIM THE GREAT ONE OF ALL TO WHOSE PLEASURE SHE AND SO MANY OTHER VICTIMS HAD BEEN SACRIFICED IN SO FAR AS THEY HAD INJURED HERSELF SHE FORGAVE THEM BUT
VARYING GREATLY IN FORM SIZE BEHAVIOR AND IN THE SONGS THEY SING SOME ON THE SMOOTH SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE SHORT AND BROAD OTHERS LONG AND RIVER LIKE IN THE SIDE CANYONS OF YOSEMITES
COULD PREVENT THE MOST EMINENT ROMAN CATHOLICS FROM PERCEIVING THAT THE PROSPERITY WHICH THEY AT LENGTH ENJOYED WAS ONLY TEMPORARY AND UNLESS WISELY USED MIGHT BE FATAL TO THEM
SUFFERED DEATH IN CHEAPSIDE SHE LEFT A PAPER WRITTEN INDEED IN NO GRACEFUL STYLE YET SUCH AS WAS READ BY MANY THOUSANDS WITH COMPASSION AND HORROR MY FAULT SHE SAID
A RIDE ON AN AVALANCHE FEW YOSEMITE VISITORS EVER SEE SNOW AVALANCHES AND FEWER STILL KNOW THE EXHILARATION OF RIDING ON THEM
DISTRACTED BETWEEN TWO DUTIES EQUALLY SACRED BETWEEN TWO AFFECTIONS EQUALLY ARDENT HOW WAS HE TO GIVE TO CAESAR ALL THAT WAS CAESAR'S AND YET TO WITHHOLD FROM GOD NO PART OF WHAT WAS GOD'S
IN ALL MY MOUNTAINEERING I HAVE ENJOYED ONLY ONE AVALANCHE RIDE AND THE START WAS SO SUDDEN AND THE END CAME SO SOON I HAD BUT LITTLE TIME TO THINK OF THE DANGER THAT ATTENDS THIS SORT OF TRAVEL
WHILE THE RELIEVED BRANCHES SPRING UP AND WAVE WITH STARTLING EFFECT IN THE GENERAL STILLNESS AS IF EACH TREE WAS MOVING OF ITS OWN VOLITION HUNDREDS OF BROAD CLOUD SHAPED MASSES MAY ALSO BE SEEN
FOR THE APPREHENSION OF BURTON BUT THE HONEST MAN WAS INCAPABLE OF BETRAYING ONE WHO IN EXTREME PERIL HAD COME UNDER THE SHADOW OF HIS ROOF
IS A TASTE WHICH EVEN MEN NOT NATURALLY CRUEL MAY BY HABIT SPEEDILY ACQUIRE THE BAR AND THE BENCH UNITED TO BROWBEAT THE UNFORTUNATE WHIG THE JURY NAMED BY A COURTLY SHERIFF
AND PILING THEIR UPROOTED TREES HEAD DOWNWARD IN ROWS ALONG THE SIDES OF THE GAPS LIKE LATERAL MORAINES SCARS AND BROKEN BRANCHES OF THE TREES STANDING ON THE SIDES OF THE GAPS RECORD THE DEPTH OF THE OVERWHELMING FLOOD
WAS THE MOST UNPARDONABLE BURTON KNEW THIS HE DELIVERED HIMSELF UP TO THE GOVERNMENT AND HE GAVE INFORMATION AGAINST FERNLEY AND ELIZABETH GAUNT THEY WERE BROUGHT TO TRIAL THE VILLAIN WHOSE LIFE THEY HAD PRESERVED
AS A CALUMNY WHICH PAPISTS AND WHIGS HAD FOR VERY DIFFERENT REASONS A COMMON INTEREST IN CIRCULATING JAMES NOW TOOK A STEP WHICH GREATLY DISCONCERTED THE WHOLE ANGLICAN PARTY
RUNNING CRYSTAL CLEAR DEEP AND FULL BUT NOT OVERFLOWING THEIR BANKS ABOUT AS DEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT AS THE DAY THE DIFFERENCE IN VOLUME SO MARKED IN SPRING BEING NOW TOO SLIGHT TO BE NOTICED
IN THIS WAY THE VOLUME OF THE UPPER BRANCHES OF THE RIVER IS NEARLY DOUBLED DURING THE DAY RISING AND FALLING AS REGULARLY AS THE TIDES OF THE SEA
HE DIED WITH COURAGE AND WITH MANY PIOUS EXPRESSIONS BUT SHOWED BY LOOK AND GESTURE SUCH STRONG RESENTMENT AT THE BARBARITY AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED THAT HIS ENEMIES SPREAD A CALUMNIOUS REPORT CONCERNING HIM
IT WAS MUCH NOTICED THAT WHILE THE FOULEST JUDICIAL MURDER WHICH HAD DISGRACED EVEN THOSE TIMES WAS PERPETRATING A TEMPEST BURST FORTH SUCH AS HAD NOT BEEN KNOWN SINCE THAT GREAT HURRICANE WHICH HAD RAGED ROUND THE DEATHBED OF OLIVER
A DULL RUSHING RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD WHICH RAPIDLY INCREASES AND SEEMS TO DRAW NEARER WITH APPALLING INTENSITY OF TONE PRESENTLY THE WHITE FLOOD COMES BOUNDING INTO SIGHT OVER BOSSES AND SHEER PLACES
BUT HE HAD STILL TO LISTEN TO REMONSTRANCES SIMILAR IN EFFECT THOUGH UTTERED IN A TONE EVEN MORE CAUTIOUS AND SUBDUED SOME MEN WHO HAD HITHERTO SERVED HIM BUT TOO STRENUOUSLY FOR THEIR OWN FAME AND FOR THE PUBLIC WELFARE
AND IN THEIR DRESS GAIT GESTURES AND GENERAL BEHAVIOR THEY ARE MUCH ALIKE AVALANCHES
BEFORE THE SUNSHINE HAD TIME TO CHANGE THEM I SET OUT EARLY TO CLIMB BY A SIDE CANYON TO THE TOP OF A COMMANDING RIDGE A LITTLE OVER THREE THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE VALLEY ON ACCOUNT OF THE LOOSENESS OF THE SNOW THAT BLOCKED THE CANYON
TO TYBURN IN ORDER TO SEE ELIZABETH GAUNT BURNED HE AFTERWARDS RELATED THAT WHEN SHE CALMLY DISPOSED THE STRAW ABOUT HER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO SHORTEN HER SUFFERINGS ALL THE BYSTANDERS BURST INTO TEARS
THE SMALL TRIBUTARIES THAT DO NOT REACH BACK TO THE LASTING SNOW FOUNTAINS OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS SHRINK TO WHISPERING TINKLING CURRENTS AFTER THE SNOW IS GONE FROM THE BASINS EXCEPTING OCCASIONAL THUNDERSHOWERS
READILY FOUND A VERDICT OF GUILTY AND IN SPITE OF THE INDIGNANT MURMURS OF THE PUBLIC CORNISH SUFFERED DEATH WITHIN TEN DAYS AFTER HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED THAT NO CIRCUMSTANCE OF DEGRADATION MIGHT BE WANTING
SMOKE ET CETERA STILL ATTEND STEAM TRAVEL THIS FLIGHT IN WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A MILKY WAY OF SNOW STARS WAS THE MOST SPIRITUAL AND EXHILARATING OF ALL THE MODES OF MOTION I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED
MUST BE FILLED WITH SHAME AND INDIGNATION BY LEARNING THAT HIS WHOLE LIFE HAD BEEN A LIE THAT WHILE HE PROFESSED TO BELONG TO THEIR COMMUNION HE HAD REALLY REGARDED THEM AS HERETICS
NOT TO BE FORGIVEN BATEMAN WAS ARRESTED AND INDICTED THE WITNESSES AGAINST HIM WERE MEN OF INFAMOUS CHARACTER MEN TOO WHO WERE SWEARING FOR THEIR OWN LIVES NONE OF THEM HAD YET GOT HIS PARDON
HAD THOUGHT THAT ON THIS POINT IT WAS ADVISABLE TO BE CAUTIOUS AND HAD NOT VENTURED TO INTER HIS BROTHER WITH THE RITES OF THE CHURCH OF ROME FOR A TIME THEREFORE EVERY MAN WAS AT LIBERTY TO BELIEVE WHAT HE WISHED
AND AS THE WHOLE MASS BENEATH AND ABOUT ME JOINED IN THE FLIGHT THERE WAS NO FRICTION THOUGH I WAS TOSSED HERE AND THERE AND LURCHED FROM SIDE TO SIDE WHEN THE AVALANCHE SWEDGED AND CAME TO REST
THOUGH AT SUCH TIMES ONE THINKS FAST ONE FINE YOSEMITE MORNING AFTER A HEAVY SNOWFALL BEING EAGER TO SEE AS MANY AVALANCHES AS POSSIBLE AND WIDE VIEWS OF THE FOREST AND SUMMIT PEAKS IN THEIR NEW WHITE ROBES
WHEN OATES AFTER HIS SCOURGING WAS CARRIED INTO NEWGATE INSENSIBLE AND AS ALL THOUGHT IN THE LAST AGONY HE HAD BEEN BLED AND HIS WOUNDS HAD BEEN DRESSED BY BATEMAN THIS WAS AN OFFENCE
MORE THAN TWO YEARS HAD SINCE ELAPSED CORNISH THOUGHT HIMSELF SAFE BUT THE EYE OF THE TYRANT WAS UPON HIM GOODENOUGH TERRIFIED BY THE NEAR PROSPECT OF DEATH
TWO PAPERS IN WHICH WERE SET FORTH VERY CONCISELY THE ARGUMENTS ORDINARILY USED BY ROMAN CATHOLICS IN CONTROVERSY WITH PROTESTANTS HAD BEEN FOUND IN CHARLES'S STRONG BOX
MIGHT ONE DAY BE FOUND TO BE NOT ONLY DISTINCT BUT INCOMPATIBLE FROM THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE STUARTS AND THE COMMONS THE CAUSE OF THE CROWN AND THE CAUSE OF THE HIERARCHY HAD TO ALL APPEARANCE
I FOUND MYSELF ON TOP OF THE CRUMPLED PILE WITHOUT BRUISE OR SCAR THIS WAS A FINE EXPERIENCE HAWTHORNE SAYS SOMEWHERE THAT STEAM HAS SPIRITUALIZED TRAVEL THOUGH UNSPIRITUAL SMELLS
HE HAD INDEED WHEN SHERIFF BEEN VERY UNWILLING TO EMPLOY AS HIS DEPUTY A MAN SO VIOLENT AND UNPRINCIPLED AS GOODENOUGH WHEN THE RYE HOUSE PLOT WAS DISCOVERED GREAT HOPES WERE ENTERTAINED AT WHITEHALL THAT CORNISH WOULD APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CONCERNED
AGAINST THE INIQUITY WHICH AFFLICTED THE EARTH SINCE THAT TERRIBLE DAY NO WOMAN HAS SUFFERED DEATH IN ENGLAND
THESE STATESMEN AND THE GREAT PARTY WHICH THEY REPRESENTED HAD TO SUFFER A CRUEL MORTIFICATION THAT THE LATE KING HAD BEEN AT HEART A ROMAN CATHOLIC HAD BEEN DURING SOME MONTHS
WATER GAVE OUT SOME YEARS AGO SOME PEOPLE WOULD HAVE PULLED THIS OLD WELL HOUSE DOWN BUT NOT ME I DID BETTER I TURNED IT TO GOOD ACCOUNT HE RAISED A HAND AND POINTED UPWARD TO AN OBVIOUSLY MODERN CEILING OF STRONG OAK TIMBERS
GOOD PLACE FOR THAT CERTAINLY AGREED BRYCE FOLLIOT POINTED HIS VISITOR TO ONE OF THE BIG CHAIRS AND TURNING TO A CABINET BROUGHT OUT SOME GLASSES A SYPHON OF SODA WATER AND A HEAVY CUT GLASS DECANTER
WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ASKED FOLLIOT
FOR A MOMENT HE THOUGHT HE WAS ALONE AND LOOKED AROUND
AND WHO'S RANSFORD THEN I NEVER HEARD BRAKE SPEAK OF ANY RANSFORD WHAT GAME IS ALL THIS WHAT BEFORE BRYCE COULD REPLY FOLLIOT SUDDENLY STARTED THRUST HIS COMPANION ASIDE AND WENT TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE OLD WELL HOUSE WHEN BRYCE CAME HURRYING UP TO HIM FOLLIOT WAS STANDING AT HIS GARDEN DOOR WITH HIS HANDS THRUST UNDER HIS COAT TAILS THE VERY PICTURE OF A BENEVOLENT LEISURED GENTLEMAN
NOW THEN WHO IS HE FOLLIOT REPLIED WITH A SHREWD GLANCE A MAN WHO BY GIVING AWAY ANOTHER MAN GAVE HIMSELF AWAY WOULD BE A DAMNED FOOL HE ANSWERED IF THERE IS ANOTHER MAN AS IF THERE MUST BE INTERRUPTED BRYCE
A SHARP EXCLAMATION FROM HIM TOOK BRYCE TO HIS SIDE FOLLIOT LIFTED A SHAKING HAND AND POINTED INTO THE GARDEN THERE HE WHISPERED HELL AND WHAT'S THIS MEAN
BUT AS WHO HE REALLY WAS JOHN BRAKE THAT WAS AT A PLACE CALLED BRADEN MEDWORTH NEAR BARTHORPE IN LEICESTERSHIRE HE PAUSED THERE WATCHING FOLLIOT BUT FOLLIOT SHOWED NO MORE THAN CLOSE ATTENTION AND BRYCE WENT ON
MY GOD HE WHISPERED DO AS I TELL YOU HISSED THE WARDER LIKE AN AUTOMATON JOHN PUT DOWN HIS BRUSHES AND WALKED SLOWLY TO THE GATE THE GREY CAR WAS CRAWLING UP THE HILL
HE WAS A MAN OF TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE LITHE AND ALERT BY NO MEANS BAD LOOKING
IF I HAVE MY PRICE IT'S NOT IN THE SAME COMMODITY THAT GLASSDALE WOULD WANT BUT BEFORE WE DO ANY TALKING ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING I WANT TO ADD TO MY STOCK OF KNOWLEDGE LOOK HERE WE'LL BE CANDID I DON'T CARE A SNAP OF MY FINGERS THAT BRAKE
WHEN THAT CAR COMES ABREAST OF THE GATE ASK NO QUESTIONS AND JUMP INTO IT GET DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM AND PULL A SACK OVER YOU AND DO NOT GET UP UNTIL THE CAR STOPS THE BLOOD RUSHED TO JOHN LEXMAN'S HEAD AND HE STAGGERED
ONE NATURALLY ADOPTS THEIR POINT OF VIEW AND SEES LIFE THROUGH THEIR DISTORTED VISION I BET I'M NOT GIVEN AWAY WITH THE NEXT LOT THE PRISONER WENT ON I'VE GOT ONE OF THE BIGGEST IDEAS I'VE EVER HAD AND I'VE GOT A REAL GOOD MAN TO HELP ME
WITHOUT REPLYING IN WORDS TO THIS SUGGESTION FOLLIOT LED THE WAY THROUGH HIS ROSE TREES TO A FAR CORNER OF HIS GROUNDS WHERE AN OLD BUILDING OF GREY STONE COVERED WITH IVY STOOD AMONGST HIGH TREES
AND ONCE HE HEARD A HOLLOW RUMBLE AS IT CROSSED A WOODEN BRIDGE HE COULD NOT DETECT FROM HIS HIDING PLACE IN WHAT DIRECTION THEY WERE GOING BUT HE GATHERED THEY HAD SWITCHED OFF TO THE LEFT
WHICH TOLD JOHN AS CLEARLY AS THOUGH THE MAN HAD CONFESSED AS MUCH THAT HE HAD NEVER OCCUPIED ANY SOCIAL POSITION IN LIFE THE WARDER'S STEP ON THE STONES OUTSIDE REDUCED THEM TO SILENCE SUDDENLY HIS VOICE CAME UP THE STAIRS
WITHIN A VERY BRIEF SPACE BUT HE WENT TO THE FIRE TOO OFTEN AND GOT HIS FINGERS BURNED IN THE END THE TWO MEN DID HIM ONE OF THEM IN PARTICULAR AND CLEARED OUT HE HAD TO STAND THE RACKET
THERE GOES FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS SAID THE GREEK WITH A SMILE
AND THEN TO HIS LEFT HAND FALKINER WRAYE HE SAID HAD AN UNFORTUNATE GUN ACCIDENT IN HIS YOUTH WHICH MARKED HIM FOR LIFE HE LOST THE MIDDLE FINGER OF HIS LEFT HAND AND HE GOT A BAD SCAR ON HIS LEFT JAW THERE THEY ARE THOSE MARKS
AND BY THAT TIME THEY WILL PICK US UP HIS VOICE WAS HIGH AND HARSH IN THE ALMOST PAINFUL SILENCE WHICH FOLLOWED THE STOPPAGE OF THE ENGINES IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE BOAT HAD COME ALONGSIDE MANNED
AT THE SIDE OF THE SEAT HE PASSED IT BACK JOHN LEXMAN READ IF YOU CANNOT SWIM THERE IS A LIFE BELT UNDER YOUR SEAT JOHN NODDED KARA WAS SEARCHING THE SEA FOR SOMETHING AND PRESENTLY HE FOUND IT
HE WAS EVIDENTLY THINKING DEEPLY AND BRYCE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DISTURB HIM SOME MINUTES WENT BY BEFORE FOLLIOT TOOK THE CIGAR FROM HIS LIPS AND LEANING AGAINST THE CHIMNEYPIECE LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HIS VISITOR LOOK HERE MY LAD HE SAID EARNESTLY
BUT NEITHER YOU NOR THE POLICE NOR ANYBODY COULD FASTEN ME TO EITHER MATTER GRANTING ALL YOU SAY TO BE TRUE WHERE'S THE POSITIVE TRUTH WHAT ABOUT CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE ASKED BRYCE
I WAS PUT AWAY BY A WOMAN AFTER THREE OF US HAD GOT CLEAR WITH TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS DAMN ROUGH LUCK WASN'T IT JOHN NODDED IT WAS CURIOUS HE THOUGHT HOW SYMPATHETIC ONE GROWS WITH THESE EXPONENTS OF CRIMES
REPLIED BRYCE PROMPTLY OF THE OTHER THE MAN OF LESSER IMPORTANCE FLOOD
LEFT BARTHORPE END SETTLED IN LONDON BRAKE AND THIS MAN BEGAN TO HAVE SOME SECRET DEALINGS TOGETHER THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN IN WITH THEM TOO
HE'S UPSTAIRS IN THE BACK ROOM THE WARDER STEPPED OUT OF THE DOOR AND LOOKED LEFT AND RIGHT COMING UP FROM PRINCETOWN WAS A BIG GREY CAR PUT DOWN YOUR PAINT POT HE SAID HIS VOICE WAS SHAKING WITH EXCITEMENT I AM GOING UPSTAIRS
AND MOTIONED BRYCE TO ENTER QUIET ENOUGH IN HERE DOCTOR HE OBSERVED YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS PLACE BIT OF A FANCY OF MINE BRYCE ABSORBED AS HE WAS IN THE THOUGHTS OF THE MOMENT
AS LEXMAN GATHERED FROM A GLIMPSE OF THE CREW BY GREEKS HE SCRAMBLED ABOARD AND FIVE MINUTES LATER HE WAS STANDING ON THE WHITE DECK OF THE YACHT WATCHING THE DISAPPEARING TAIL OF THE MONOPLANE KARA WAS BY HIS SIDE
BRAKE HAD EVIDENTLY A BELIEF IN THESE MEN AND HE TRUSTED THEM UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIMSELF HE SOMETIMES TRUSTED THE BANK'S MONEY TO THEM I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HE USED TO LET THEM HAVE MONEY FOR SHORT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TO BE REFUNDED
IF BRYCE HAD BUT KNOWN IT WHILE HE REMAINED SILENT HE WATCHED BRYCE NARROWLY AND WHEN HE SPOKE HIS VOICE WAS CALM AS EVER
FOLLIOT NODDED WITHOUT ANY CHANGE OF EXPRESSION AYE DOCTOR HE SAID AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT GLASSDALE NOW BRYCE WHO WOULD HAVE CHEERFULLY HOBNOBBED WITH A MAN
FOR THE DAY HE WAS TO PAINT SOME DOORS AND WINDOWS OF AN OUTLYING COTTAGE A COTTAGE OCCUPIED BY A WARDER WHO FOR SOME REASON ON THE DAY PREVIOUS HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN HIS FAMILY AFFAIRS SAID BRYCE WHAT BECAME OF BRAKE'S WIFE AND CHILDREN WHEN HE WENT TO PRISON FOLLIOT SHOOK HIS HEAD
NOT MINE MY LAD ANSWERED FOLLIOT CONFIDENTLY THAT'S A FACT BRYCE HESITATED GIVING FOLLIOT A SEARCHING LOOK AND FOLLIOT NODDED SOLEMNLY I TELL YOU NOT MINE HE REPEATED I'D NAUGHT TO DO WITH IT
THE TWO OR THREE CHAIRS WERE DEEP AND BIG ENOUGH TO LIE DOWN IN THE TWO WINDOWS COMMANDED PLEASANT VIEWS OF THE CATHEDRAL TOWERS ON ONE SIDE AND OF THE CLOSE ON THE OTHER NICE LITTLE PLACE TO BE ALONE IN D'YE SEE SAID FOLLIOT
COOL IN SUMMER WARM IN WINTER MODERN FIRE GRATE YOU NOTICE
HAD THAT PUT IN HE CONTINUED AND TURNED THE TOP OF THE BUILDING INTO A LITTLE SNUGGERY COME UP HE LED THE WAY TO A FLIGHT OF STEPS IN ONE CORNER OF THE LOWER ROOM PUSHED OPEN A DOOR AT THEIR HEAD
YOU'D HAVE A JOB TO GET IT RETORTED FOLLIOT SUPPOSING THAT ALL YOU SAY IS TRUE ABOUT ABOUT PAST MATTERS NOTHING CAN PROVE NOTHING
THAT COLLISHAW'S DEAD NOR IF ONE HAD HIS NECK BROKEN AND THE OTHER WAS POISONED BUT WHOSE HAND WAS THAT WHICH THE MASON VARNER SAW THAT MORNING WHEN BRAKE WAS FLUNG OUT OF THAT DOORWAY COME NOW WHOSE
THE FACT IS I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU SO
VIEWED FROM THE HEIGHT AT WHICH THEY FLEW IT LOOKED NO MORE THAN A WHITE SPECK IN A GREAT BLUE SAUCER BUT PRESENTLY THE MACHINE BEGAN TO DIP FALLING AT A TERRIFIC RATE OF SPEED WHICH TOOK AWAY THE BREATH OF THE MAN WHO WAS HANGING ON WITH BOTH HANDS
WHICH MARKS THE CONVICT HIS HEAD WAS CLIPPED SHORT
HE DARE NOT LET HIS MIND DWELL UPON THE LONG ACHING YEARS AHEAD HE DARE NOT THINK OF THE WOMAN HE LEFT OR LET HIS MIND DWELL UPON THE AGONY WHICH SHE WAS ENDURING HE HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE WORLD
A WIDE TERM REMARKED FOLLIOT
JOHN STUMBLED DOWN THE SLOPE AS HE NEARED THE MACHINE HE STOPPED AND GASPED KARA HE SAID AND THE BROWN MAN SMILED BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
YOU SAID JUST NOW THAT YOU'D NO DOUBT THAT MAN GLASSDALE COULD BE BOUGHT AND I'M INCLINING TO THINK THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE MEN THAT HAVE THEIR PRICE WHAT IS IT WE'VE NOT COME TO THAT RETORTED BRYCE YOU'RE A BIT MISTAKEN
FORTY THREE HE CALLED SHARPLY I WANT YOU DOWN HERE JOHN TOOK HIS PAINT POT AND BRUSH AND WENT CLATTERING DOWN THE UNCARPETED STAIRS WHERE'S THE OTHER MAN ASKED THE WARDER IN A LOW VOICE
I'VE DISCOVERED A GREAT DEAL MORE MUCH MORE THAN'S KNOWN TO ANYBODY FOLLIOT THREW ONE LEG OVER THE OTHER AND BEGAN TO JOG HIS FOOT OH HE SAID AFTER A PAUSE DEAR ME AND WHAT MIGHT YOU KNOW NOW DOCTOR AUGHT YOU CAN TELL ME EH
NEVER ONCE DID HE FEEL THE CAR SLACKEN ITS PACE UNTIL WITH A GRIND OF BRAKES IT STOPPED SUDDENLY GET OUT SAID A VOICE JOHN LEXMAN THREW OFF THE COVER AND LEAPT OUT AND AS HE DID SO
OF HIS IMPRISONMENT HE HAD BEEN SENT TO DARTMOOR AFTER SPENDING THREE MONTHS IN WORMWOOD SCRUBBS OLD HANDS HAD TOLD HIM VARIOUSLY THAT HE WAS FORTUNATE OR UNLUCKY IT WAS USUAL TO HAVE TWELVE MONTHS AT THE SCRUBBS
WAS WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE PAINTER THE TWO WARDERS EXCHANGED GREETINGS
THE WORLD HE LOVED AND THE WORLD THAT KNEW HIM AND ALL THAT THERE WAS IN LIFE ALL THAT WAS WORTH WHILE HAD BEEN CRUSHED AND OBLITERATED INTO THE GRANITE OF THE PRINCETOWN QUARRIES
YOU'RE WRONG HE ANSWERED I NEVER AT ANY TIME KNEW ANYTHING OF BRAKE'S FAMILY AFFAIRS SO LITTLE INDEED THAT I NEVER EVEN KNEW HE WAS MARRIED BRYCE ROSE TO HIS FEET AND STOOD STARING WHAT HE EXCLAIMED
AND LEAVING HIM TO PAY THE PENALTY OF HIS OVER TRUSTFULNESS CLEARED OUT OF ENGLAND AND CARRIED HIS MONEY MAKING TALENTS TO FOREIGN PARTS HE SUCCEEDED IN DOING WELL
AS HE DID SO HE FELT THE CAR LEAP FORWARD UNDERNEATH HIM NOW IT WAS GOING FAST NOW FASTER NOW IT ROCKED AND SWAYED AS IT GATHERED SPEED HE FELT IT SWEEPING DOWN HILL AND UP HILL
IN THAT PART OF FOLLIOT'S BIG GARDEN I WANT A BIT OF TALK WITH YOU SAID BRYCE AS FOLLIOT CLOSED THE DOOR AND TURNED DOWN A SIDE PATH TO A STILL MORE RETIRED REGION PRIVATE TALK LET'S GO WHERE IT'S QUIET
AND HAD CARRIED HIS OWN GLASS TO ANOTHER EASY CHAIR DID FOLLIOT REFER TO ANY REASON FOR BRYCE'S VISIT BUT ONCE SETTLED DOWN HE LOOKED AT HIM SPECULATIVELY WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME ABOUT HE ASKED
I WAS HERE WHEN I WAS A KID CONFESSED THE PAPER HANGER I AM GOING OUT NEXT WEEK JOHN LEXMAN LOOKED AT HIM ENVIOUSLY HAD THE MAN TOLD HIM THAT HE HAD INHERITED A GREAT FORTUNE AND A GREATER TITLE
IT WAS ALL SO INCREDIBLE SO IMPOSSIBLE HE EXPECTED TO WAKE UP
WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY TAKEN BY THE PRISON STAFF AND IT WAS TO THE DECORATION OF ONE OF THESE THAT A O FORTY THREE HAD BEEN SENT THE HOUSE WAS AS YET WITHOUT A TENANT A PAPER HANGER UNDER THE CHARGE OF ANOTHER WARDER
WITH A GLANCE OF SIGNIFICANT INTEREST DEEPEST WELL IN ALL WRYCHESTER UNDER THAT HE REMARKED YOU'D NEVER THINK IT IT'S A HUNDRED FEET DEEP AND MORE DRY NOW
THEN HE'S SAFE CONCLUDED FOLLIOT YOU'LL GET NOTHING FROM ME ABOUT HIM AND NOBODY CAN GET AT YOU EXCEPT THROUGH HIM ASKED BRYCE THAT'S ABOUT IT ASSENTED FOLLIOT LACONICALLY BRYCE LAUGHED CYNICALLY
TO CHOOSE HIS OWN DINNER TO ANSWER NO CALL SAVE THE CALL OF HIS CONSCIENCE TO SEE HE CHECKED HIMSELF WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR HE ASKED IN SELF DEFENCE CONSPIRACY AND FRAUD SAID THE OTHER CHEERFULLY
TO WHAT I KNOW FOLLIOT HAD ALLOWED HIS CIGAR TO GO OUT HE THREW IT AWAY TOOK A FRESH ONE FROM THE BOX AND SLOWLY STRUCK A MATCH AND LIGHTED IT WHAT MIGHT YOU KNOW NOW HE ASKED AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF HORSES BUT ONLY A GREAT BAT LIKE MACHINE WITH OUT STRETCHED PINIONS OF TAUT WHITE CANVAS AND BY THAT MACHINE
BUT IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ALL SIGNS OF THE LAND WERE BLOTTED OUT TALKING WAS IMPOSSIBLE THE ROAR OF THE ENGINES DEFIED PENETRATION KARA WAS EVIDENTLY A SKILFUL PILOT
WHEN HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY SAID THE OTHER I HAVE NO REASON TO BE GRATEFUL TO YOU AS YET KARA BREATHED LEXMAN A WORD FROM YOU COULD HAVE SAVED ME I COULD NOT LIE MY DEAR LEXMAN
HOW ASKED JOHN IN SURPRISE THE MAN JERKED HIS HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISON LARRY GREEN HE SAID BRIEFLY HE'S COMING OUT NEXT MONTH TOO AND WE ARE ALL FIXED UP PROPER WE ARE GOING TO GET THE PILE
NOW HE SAW THE POINT FOR WHICH KARA WAS MAKING A WHITE STEAM YACHT LONG AND NARROW OF BEAM WAS STEAMING SLOWLY WESTWARD HE COULD SEE THE FEATHERY WAKE IN HER REAR
THAT HE WAS COMING TO SEE YOU BUT I KNOW WHAT PUT THE NOTION INTO HIS HEAD I GAVE HIM COPIES OF THOSE TWO REWARD BILLS HE NO DOUBT THOUGHT HE MIGHT MAKE A BIT AND SO HE CAME IN TO TOWN AND TO YOU WELL ASKED FOLLIOT
I MEAN ABOUT RECENT MATTERS REPLIED BRYCE I'VE INTERESTED MYSELF IN THEM FOR REASONS OF MY OWN EVER SINCE BRADEN WAS FOUND AT THE FOOT OF THOSE STAIRS IN PARADISE AND I WAS FETCHED TO HIM I'VE INTERESTED MYSELF AND
BRYCE LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION POINTED OUT BEHIND THE PERGOLA OF RAMBLER ROSES THE FIGURES OF MEN WERE COMING TOWARDS THE OLD WELL HOUSE LED BY ONE OF FOLLIOT'S GARDENERS SUDDENLY THEY EMERGED INTO FULL VIEW
NEW INTERESTS MADE UP HIS EXISTENCE THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD WAS ONE THE CHARACTER OF THE BOOK HE WOULD RECEIVE FROM THE PRISON LIBRARY ANOTHER THE FUTURE MEANT SUNDAY CHAPEL THE PRESENT WHATEVER TASK THEY FOUND HIM
BRYCE IN HIS EAGERNESS AND SURPRISE GRASPED FOLLIOT'S ARM AND SHOOK IT GOOD HEAVENS MAN HE SAID THOSE TWO WARDS OF RANSFORD'S ARE BRAKE'S GIRL AND BOY DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT DIDN'T YOU NEVER ANSWERED FOLLIOT NEVER
HIS ENVY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO GENUINE GOING OUT THE DRIVE IN THE BRAKE TO THE STATION THE RIDE TO LONDON IN CREASED BUT COMFORTABLE CLOTHING FREE AS THE AIR AT LIBERTY TO GO TO BED AND RISE WHEN HE LIKED
YOU HAVEN'T TIME FOR ARGUMENT THEY DISCOVERED YOUR ESCAPE HE SAID GET IN JOHN CLAMBERED UP INTO THE FRAIL BODY OF THE MACHINE AND KARA FOLLOWED THIS IS A SELF STARTER HE SAID ONE OF THE NEWEST MODELS OF MONOPLANES
BUT BRYCE SAW THAT HIS COOL ALMOST INDIFFERENT MANNER WAS CHANGING HE WAS BEGINNING UNDER THE SURFACE TO GET ANXIOUS WHEN I LEFT GLASSDALE AT NOON CONTINUED BRYCE I'D NO IDEA AND I DON'T THINK HE HAD
WHOM HE WAS ABOUT TO CONDUCT TO THE SCAFFOLD LIFTED HIS GLASS AND DRANK A GOOD DEAL HE ANSWERED
HE TURNED AT THE SOUND OF A VOICE HE WAS STANDING ON THE SLOPE OF A SMALL TOR AT THE FOOT THERE WAS A SMOOTH STRETCH OF GREEN SWARD IT WAS ON THIS STRETCH THAT THE PEOPLE OF DARTMOOR HELD THEIR PONY RACES IN THE SUMMER MONTHS
HE HEARD THE SHUFFLING FEET OF THE QUARRY GANG HIS EARS CAUGHT THE CLINK OF THE CHAINS WHICH BOUND THEM TOGETHER THEY WERE DESPERATE MEN PECULIARLY INTERESTING TO HIM AND HE HAD WATCHED THEIR FACES FURTIVELY IN THE EARLY PERIOD
WITH A CERTAIN KINDNESS AND A CERTAIN RESPECT WHICH WAS UNUSUAL FACE THE WALL GROWLED A VOICE AND MECHANICALLY HE TURNED HIS HANDS STILL BEHIND HIM AND STOOD STARING AT THE GREY WALL OF THE PRISON STOREHOUSE
WHICH CAME INTO THE EYES OF THE QUESTIONER WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FIFTEEN YEARS SAID THE OTHER THAT MEANS ELEVEN YEARS AND NINE MONTHS SAID THE FIRST MAN YOU'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE I SUPPOSE HARDLY SAID LEXMAN DRILY
WHICH DISTINGUISHED THE MAJORITY OF THE INHABITANTS AT DARTMOOR THEY WAITED UNTIL THEY HEARD THE WARDER'S STEP CLEAR THE PASSAGE AND UNTIL HIS IRON SHOD BOOTS WERE TRAMPING OVER THE COBBLED PATH WHICH LED FROM THE DOOR THROUGH THE TINY GARDEN TO THE ROAD
LEAVING THE OTHER IN CHARGE OF BOTH MEN FOR AN HOUR THEY WORKED IN SILENCE UNDER THE EYES OF THE GUARD PRESENTLY THE WARDER WENT OUTSIDE AND JOHN LEXMAN HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING HIS FELLOW SUFFERER
TO THE DANGEROUS SEAT BEHIND HE WAS DEADLY COLD
ON THE OTHER HAND I CAN PROVE EASILY THAT I NEVER DID MEET HIM I CAN ACCOUNT FOR EVERY MINUTE OF MY TIME THAT DAY AS TO THE OTHER AFFAIR NOT AN OUNCE OF DIRECT EVIDENCE THEN IT WAS THE OTHER MAN EXCLAIMED BRYCE
BEFORE THE SECOND MAN SPOKE WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR HE ASKED IN A LOW VOICE MURDER SAID JOHN LEXMAN LACONICALLY HE HAD ANSWERED THE QUESTION BEFORE
HE WANTED TO FIND THOSE TWO MEN AND BEGAN A LONG SEARCH FOR THEM LIKE TO KNOW THE NAMES OF THE MEN MISTER FOLLIOT YOU MIGHT MENTION EM IF YOU KNOW EM ANSWERED FOLLIOT THE NAME OF THE PARTICULAR ONE WAS WRAYE FALKINER WRAYE
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT HE SHOULD SEE IT
AND AS THE AEROPLANE FELL HE HAD TIME TO OBSERVE THAT A BOAT HAD BEEN PUT OFF THEN WITH A JERK THE MONOPLANE FLATTENED OUT AND CAME LIKE A SKIMMING BIRD TO THE SURFACE OF THE WATER HER ENGINES STOPPED
AND NOW POLISHED TO MARBLE LIKE SMOOTHNESS IN ITS MIDST SET FLUSH WITH THE FLOOR WAS WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY A TRAP DOOR FURNISHED WITH A HEAVY IRON RING TO THIS FOLLIOT POINTED
AND THEN SUDDENLY THE JERKY PROGRESS CEASED THE MACHINE SWAYED GENTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND LOOKING OVER THE PASSENGER SAW THE GROUND RECEDE BENEATH HIM UP UP THEY CLIMBED IN ONE LONG SWEEPING ASCENT
HE NODDED AT A BOX OF CIGARS WHICH LAY OPEN ON A TABLE AT BRYCE'S ELBOW AS HE BEGAN TO MIX A COUPLE OF DRINKS HELP YOURSELF HE SAID GOOD STUFF THOSE NOT UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN BRYCE A DRINK
AND CLOSE BEHIND HIM THE DETECTIVE
BEFORE TESTING THE LIFE OF A CONVICT ESTABLISHMENT HE BELIEVED THERE WAS SOME TALK OF SENDING HIM TO PARKHURST AND HERE HE TRACED THE INFLUENCE WHICH T X WOULD EXERCISE FOR PARKHURST WAS A PRISONER'S PARADISE
AND EVENTUALLY HE CAME BACK AND MARRIED A RICH WIDOW AND SETTLED HIMSELF DOWN IN AN OUT OF THE WORLD ENGLISH TOWN TO GROW ROSES YOU'RE FALKINER WRAYE YOU KNOW MISTER FOLLIOT BRYCE LAUGHED AS HE MADE THIS DIRECT ACCUSATION
PASSING THROUGH DRIFTING CLOUDS
BEYOND THE VILLAGE OF PRINCETOWN AND ON THE TAVISTOCK ROAD
THEN WHO HAD DEMANDED BRYCE WAS IT THE OTHER MAN FLOOD AND IF SO WHO IS FLOOD FOLLIOT GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND CIGAR BETWEEN HIS LIPS AND HANDS UNDER THE TAILS OF HIS OLD COAT
FORTUNATE FOR YOU MISTER FOLLIOT THAT THE POLICE DON'T KNOW ALL THAT I KNOW FOR IF THEY DID THOSE MARKS WOULD HAVE DONE FOR YOU DAYS AGO FOR A MINUTE OR TWO FOLLIOT SAT JOGGLING HIS LEG A BAD SIGN IN HIM OF RISING TEMPER
IT WAS A SQUARE BUILDING OF OLD STONE ITS WALLS UNLINED UNPLASTERED ITS FLOOR PAVED WITH MUCH WORN FLAGS OF LIMESTONE EVIDENTLY SET DOWN IN A LONG DEAD AGE
HE CLICKED OVER A LEVER AND WITH A ROAR THE BIG THREE BLADED TRACTOR SCREW SPUN THE AEROPLANE MOVED FORWARD WITH A JERK
WHICH SHOWED THAT HE KNEW HE HAD THE WHIP HAND SHALL I TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT FALKINER WRAYE HE ASKED I WILL IT'S DEEPLY INTERESTING MISTER FALKINER WRAYE AFTER CHEATING AND DECEIVING BRAKE
NOT MUCH IN THAT FOR THE REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY HE CONTINUED BUT BRAKE HAD OTHER ASSOCIATIONS WITH BARTHORPE A BIT LATER HE GOT TO KNOW GOT INTO CLOSE TOUCH WITH A BARTHORPE MAN WHO ABOUT THE TIME OF BRAKE'S MARRIAGE
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO
FROM TIME TO TIME HE CONSULTED THE COMPASS ON THE BOARD BEFORE HIM AND CHANGED HIS COURSE EVER SO SLIGHTLY PRESENTLY HE RELEASED ONE HAND FROM THE DRIVING WHEEL AND SCRIBBLING ON A LITTLE BLOCK OF PAPER WHICH WAS INSERTED IN A POCKET
AND THE FACE OF THE DRIVER WAS HALF ENVELOPED IN A BIG RUBBER MASK THROUGH THE TWO GREAT GOGGLES JOHN COULD SEE LITTLE TO HELP HIM IDENTIFY THE MAN AS THE MACHINE CAME UP TO THE GATE HE LEAPT INTO THE TONNEAU AND SANK INSTANTLY TO THE BOTTOM
JOHN LEXMAN LOOKED DOWN HE SAW THE INDENTATIONS OF THE COAST
BRYCE WHO HAD LIGHTED A CIGAR LOOKED ACROSS ITS SMOKE AT THE IMPERTURBABLE FACE OPPOSITE YOU'VE JUST HAD GLASSDALE HERE HE OBSERVED QUIETLY I SAW HIM LEAVE YOU
I SHOULDN'T WONDER REMARKED BRYCE REFLECTIVELY AND ALMOST AS IF SPEAKING TO HIMSELF I SHOULDN'T AT ALL WONDER IF GLASSDALE'S THE SORT OF MAN WHO CAN BE BOUGHT HE NO DOUBT HAS HIS PRICE BUT ALL THAT GLASSDALE KNOWS IS NOTHING
HE HEARD HIS WARDER'S VOICE BEHIND HIM RIGHT TURN FORTY THREE QUICK MARCH HE WALKED AHEAD OF THE ARMED GUARD THROUGH THE GREAT AND GLOOMY GATES OF THE PRISON TURNED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT AND WALKED UP THE VILLAGE STREET
YOU'RE NO DOUBT AS YOU SAY A GOOD HAND AT FINDING THINGS OUT AND YOU'VE DOUBTLESS DONE A GOOD BIT OF FERRETING AND DONE IT WELL ENOUGH IN YOUR OWN OPINION BUT THERE'S ONE THING YOU CAN'T FIND OUT AND THE POLICE CAN'T FIND OUT EITHER
A PRETTY COIL HE SAID WITH A SNEER HERE YOU TALKED ABOUT MY PRICE I'M QUITE CONTENT TO HOLD MY TONGUE IF YOU'D TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO WHAT ASKED FOLLIOT YOU KNEW BRAKE
LOTS ANSWERED BRYCE I CAME TO TELL YOU ON SEEING THAT GLASSDALE HAD BEEN WITH YOU BECAUSE I WAS WITH GLASSDALE THIS MORNING FOLLIOT MADE NO ANSWER
HE STOOD IT TO THE TUNE OF TEN YEARS PENAL SERVITUDE
UPON HIS HAGGARD FACE STANDING WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM HE WAITED FOR THE MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD BE ORDERED TO HIS WORK JOHN LEXMAN A O FORTY THREE
AND ABOUT WHO KILLED HIM AND WHY THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY OF DOING ALL THAT SORT OF THING YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK A LONG WAY BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNINGS I WENT BACK TO THE TIME WHEN BRADEN WAS MARRIED NOT AS BRADEN OF COURSE
MY WIFE SHE IS WAITING FOR YOU SAID THE OTHER HE TURNED HIS HEAD LISTENING
AND DON'T YER SPEAK
BUT HAD IN THE BEGINNING DIFFIDENTLY TAKEN THE CORNER UPON WHICH THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE GAVE A HOWLING CORNER IN THE WINTER TIME A DUSTY CORNER IN THE SUMMER TIME AN UNDESIRABLE CORNER AT THE BEST OF TIMES
YER'D HAVE BEEN LOCKED UP HARD AND FAST A WEEK AGO MY LADY AND SERVE YER RIGHT FOR BEING A FOOL I KNOW I AIN'T AS CUNNING AS YOU ARE REPLIED CHARLOTTE BUT DON'T PUT ALL THE BLAME ON ME AND SAY I SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOCKED UP YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN

STRANGERS REPEATED THE OLD MAN
AS IF REPROACHING HER TARDINESS AND URGING HER TO GREATER EXERTION THUS THEY HAD TOILED ALONG THE DUSTY ROAD TAKING LITTLE HEED OF ANY OBJECT WITHIN SIGHT
MISTER WEGG REPLIED TARTLY TO THIS PERSONAL INQUIRY IN AN ACCIDENT DO YOU LIKE IT WELL I HAVEN'T GOT TO KEEP IT WARM
MISTER MORRIS BOLTER THIS IS MISSUS BOLTER MISSUS BOLTER'S HUMBLE SERVANT SAID FAGIN BOWING WITH GROTESQUE POLITENESS I HOPE I SHALL KNOW HER BETTER VERY SHORTLY DO YOU HEAR THE GENTLEMAN CHARLOTTE
AND AS HE CROSSED THE ROAD WHILE SPEAKING AS IF FULLY PREPARED TO PUT HIS THREAT INTO EXECUTION THE WOMAN ROSE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER REMARK AND TRUDGED ONWARD BY HIS SIDE
AS IT WAS NOT MISTER CLAYPOLE'S HABIT TO REPOSE A BLIND AND FOOLISH CONFIDENCE IN ANYBODY IT SHOULD BE OBSERVED IN JUSTICE TO THAT GENTLEMAN THAT HE HAD TRUSTED CHARLOTTE TO THIS EXTENT IN ORDER THAT IF THEY WERE PURSUED
THE ONLY ARTICLE IN WHICH SILAS DEALT THAT WAS NOT HARD WAS GINGERBREAD ON A CERTAIN DAY SOME WRETCHED INFANT HAVING PURCHASED THE DAMP GINGERBREAD HORSE FEARFULLY OUT OF CONDITION AND THE ADHESIVE BIRD CAGE
BUT THIS ONCE DONE WAS QUITE SATISFACTORY AND HE RESTED PERSUADED THAT HE KNEW HIS WAY ABOUT THE HOUSE BLINDFOLD FROM THE BARRED GARRETS IN THE HIGH ROOF TO THE TWO IRON EXTINGUISHERS BEFORE THE MAIN DOOR
FROM A STICK WHICH HE CARRIED OVER HIS SHOULDER A SMALL PARCEL WRAPPED IN A COMMON HANDKERCHIEF AND APPARENTLY LIGHT ENOUGH THIS CIRCUMSTANCE ADDED TO THE LENGTH OF HIS LEGS WHICH WERE OF UNUSUAL EXTENT
WHAT A LAZYBONES YER ARE CHARLOTTE IT'S A HEAVY LOAD I CAN TELL YOU SAID THE FEMALE COMING UP ALMOST BREATHLESS WITH FATIGUE HEAVY WHAT ARE YER TALKING ABOUT WHAT ARE YER MADE FOR
THOUGHT SILAS QUALIFYING HIS FORMER GOOD OPINION AS THE OTHER AMBLED OFF BUT IN A MOMENT HE WAS BACK AGAIN WITH THE QUESTION HOW DID YOU GET YOUR WOODEN LEG
TO BE ANYTHING ELSE INQUIRED FAGIN SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS HERE LET ME HAVE A WORD WITH YOU OUTSIDE
HERE YOU ARE AGAIN REPEATED MISTER WEGG MUSING AND WHAT ARE YOU NOW ARE YOU IN THE FUNNS OR WHERE ARE YOU HAVE YOU LATELY COME TO SETTLE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD
R THREE WHAT CRIPPLES SAID CHARLOTTE THREE CRIPPLES REPEATED NOAH AND A VERY GOOD SIGN TOO NOW THEN KEEP CLOSE AT MY HEELS AND COME ALONG
HE CROSSED INTO SAINT JOHN'S ROAD AND WAS SOON DEEP IN THE OBSCURITY OF THE INTRICATE AND DIRTY WAYS WHICH LYING BETWEEN GRAY'S INN LANE AND SMITHFIELD RENDER THAT PART OF THE TOWN ONE OF THE LOWEST AND WORST THAT IMPROVEMENT HAS LEFT IN THE MIDST OF LONDON
SAID NOAH DISENGAGING HIMSELF WITH GREAT GRAVITY I SHOULD LIKE TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF SOME BAND AND HAVE THE WHOPPING OF EM AND FOLLERING EM ABOUT UNBEKNOWN TO THEMSELVES THAT WOULD SUIT ME IF THERE WAS GOOD PROFIT
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH FAGIN FOLLOWED UP THIS REMARK BY STRIKING THE SIDE OF HIS NOSE WITH HIS RIGHT FOREFINGER A GESTURE WHICH NOAH ATTEMPTED TO IMITATE
MISTER CLAYPOLE LOOKED INTO THE PORTER POT WITH AN ASPECT OF DEEP WISDOM AND HAVING WELL SHAKEN ITS CONTENTS NODDED CONDESCENDINGLY TO CHARLOTTE AND TOOK A DRAUGHT WHEREWITH HE APPEARED GREATLY REFRESHED
ON SIMILAR GROUNDS HE NEVER BEHELD AN INMATE AT ANY ONE OF ITS WINDOWS BUT HE TOUCHED HIS HAT YET HE KNEW SO LITTLE ABOUT THE INMATES THAT HE GAVE THEM NAMES OF HIS OWN INVENTION AS MISS ELIZABETH MASTER GEORGE
WITH HIS REMAINING FOOT IN A BASKET IN COLD WEATHER PICKING UP A LIVING ON THIS WISE EVERY MORNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK HE STUMPED TO THE CORNER CARRYING A CHAIR A CLOTHES HORSE A PAIR OF TRESTLES A BOARD A BASKET AND AN UMBRELLA
MUCH FARTHER YER AS GOOD AS THERE SAID THE LONG LEGGED TRAMPER POINTING OUT BEFORE HIM LOOK THERE THOSE ARE THE LIGHTS OF LONDON THEY'RE A GOOD TWO MILE OFF AT LEAST
THE MONEY MIGHT BE FOUND ON HER WHICH WOULD LEAVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY OF ASSERTING HIS INNOCENCE OF ANY THEFT AND WOULD GREATLY FACILITATE HIS CHANCES OF ESCAPE OF COURSE HE ENTERED AT THIS JUNCTURE
BLACK WATER PIPE WHICH TRAILED ITSELF OVER THE AREA DOOR INTO A DAMP STONE PASSAGE AND HAD RATHER THE AIR OF A LEECH ON THE HOUSE THAT HAD TAKEN WONDERFULLY BUT THIS WAS NO IMPEDIMENT TO HIS ARRANGING IT ACCORDING TO A PLAN OF HIS OWN
NOT NEAR REPLIED MISTER CLAYPOLE THERE NOT NEAR SO DON'T THINK IT WHY NOT
INTO NO EXPLANATION OF HIS MOTIVES AND THEY WALKED ON VERY LOVINGLY TOGETHER IN PURSUANCE OF THIS CAUTIOUS PLAN MISTER CLAYPOLE WENT ON WITHOUT HALTING UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE ANGEL
SAVE WHEN THEY STEPPED ASIDE TO ALLOW A WIDER PASSAGE FOR THE MAIL COACHES WHICH WERE WHIRLING OUT OF TOWN UNTIL THEY PASSED THROUGH HIGHGATE ARCHWAY WHEN THE FOREMOST TRAVELLER STOPPED AND CALLED IMPATIENTLY TO HIS COMPANION COME ON CAN'T YER
COULD YOU DO BETTER THAN JOIN HIM IS HE IN A GOOD WAY OF BUSINESS THAT'S WHERE IT IS RESPONDED NOAH WINKING ONE OF HIS LITTLE EYES THE TOP OF THE TREE EMPLOYS A POWER OF HANDS
SHE ASKED AFTER THEY HAD WALKED A FEW HUNDRED YARDS HOW SHOULD I KNOW REPLIED NOAH WHOSE TEMPER HAD BEEN CONSIDERABLY IMPAIRED BY WALKING NEAR I HOPE
WITH A COUNTENANCE OF ASHY PALENESS AND EXCESSIVE TERROR DON'T MIND ME MY DEAR SAID FAGIN DRAWING HIS CHAIR CLOSER HA HA
RETURNED SILAS DRILY AND WITH RETICENCE IT'S NOT YET BROUGHT TO AN EXACT ALLOWANCE OH IT'S NOT YET BROUGHT TO AN EXACT ALLOWANCE NO IT'S NOT YET BROUGHT TO AN EXACT ALLOWANCE OH MORNING MORNING MORNING
SAID NOAH BARNEY COMPLIED BY USHERING THEM INTO A SMALL BACK ROOM AND SETTING THE REQUIRED VIANDS BEFORE THEM HAVING DONE WHICH HE INFORMED THE TRAVELLERS THAT THEY COULD BE LODGED THAT NIGHT
ASKED FAGIN THERE'S A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY MADE IN SNATCHING THEIR BAGS AND PARCELS AND RUNNING ROUND THE CORNER DON'T THEY HOLLER OUT A GOOD DEAL AND SCRATCH SOMETIMES ASKED NOAH SHAKING HIS HEAD
YER'VE GOT IT NOW CHARLOTTE YER KNOW YER HAVE NO MATTER WHO'S GOT IT OR WHO DID IT MY DEAR REPLIED FAGIN GLANCING NEVERTHELESS WITH A HAWK'S EYE AT THE GIRL AND THE TWO BUNDLES
CHAPTER FIVE BOFFIN'S BOWER OVER AGAINST A LONDON HOUSE A CORNER HOUSE NOT FAR FROM CAVENDISH SQUARE A MAN WITH A WOODEN LEG HAD SAT FOR SOME YEARS
I SHALL LOOK OUT TO GET INTO COMPANY WITH THEM AS CAN REPLIED NOAH THEY'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE US USEFUL SOME WAY OR ANOTHER WHY YOU YOURSELF ARE WORTH FIFTY WOMEN
I'M IN THAT WAY MYSELF AND I LIKE YOU FOR IT IN WHAT WAY ASKED MISTER CLAYPOLE A LITTLE RECOVERING IN THAT WAY OF BUSINESS REJOINED FAGIN AND SO ARE THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE
LIKE OVERGROWN BOYS THE WOMAN WAS YOUNG BUT OF A ROBUST AND HARDY MAKE AS SHE NEED HAVE BEEN TO BEAR THE WEIGHT OF THE HEAVY BUNDLE WHICH WAS STRAPPED TO HER BACK HER COMPANION WAS NOT ENCUMBERED WITH MUCH LUGGAGE AS THERE MERELY DANGLED
AND IF WE COULD ONLY GET IN WITH SOME GENTLEMAN OF THIS SORT I SAY IT WOULD BE CHEAP AT THAT TWENTY POUND NOTE YOU'VE GOT ESPECIALLY AS WE DON'T VERY WELL KNOW HOW TO GET RID OF IT OURSELVES AFTER EXPRESSING THIS OPINION
IF I HAD BEEN ANY WAY YER TOOK THE MONEY FROM THE TILL YER KNOW YER DID SAID MISTER CLAYPOLE I TOOK IT FOR YOU NOAH DEAR REJOINED CHARLOTTE DID I KEEP IT
AND THE RATTLE SPRUNG SOOTH TO SAY HE WAS SO WOODEN A MAN THAT HE SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN HIS WOODEN LEG NATURALLY AND RATHER SUGGESTED TO THE FANCIFUL OBSERVER THAT HE MIGHT BE EXPECTED IF HIS DEVELOPMENT RECEIVED NO UNTIMELY CHECK
THE LANDLORD OF THE HOUSE HAD NOT WITHDRAWN HIS EYE
AND HALF OF ALL THE YOUNG WOMAN EARNS REPLIED MISTER FAGIN WHETHER NOAH CLAYPOLE WHOSE RAPACITY WAS NONE OF THE LEAST COMPREHENSIVE WOULD HAVE ACCEDED EVEN TO THESE GLOWING TERMS
ANXIOUSLY REGARDING HIM SOMETHING IN THE SNEAKING WAY
THROUGH THESE STREETS NOAH CLAYPOLE WALKED DRAGGING CHARLOTTE AFTER HIM NOW STEPPING INTO THE KENNEL TO EMBRACE AT A GLANCE THE WHOLE EXTERNAL CHARACTER OF SOME SMALL PUBLIC HOUSE NOW JOGGING ON AGAIN
TO THE DOCTOR A CONFIDENTIAL BOW AS TO A GENTLEMAN WHOSE ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIS INSIDE HE BEGGED RESPECTFULLY TO ACKNOWLEDGE BEFORE THE QUALITY HE DELIGHTED TO ABASE HIMSELF AND FOR UNCLE PARKER WHO WAS IN THE ARMY
SO THAT SOWERBERRY IF HE COME UP AFTER US MIGHT POKE IN HIS OLD NOSE AND HAVE US TAKEN BACK IN A CART WITH HANDCUFFS ON SAID MISTER CLAYPOLE IN A JEERING TONE NO I SHALL GO AND LOSE MYSELF AMONG THE NARROWEST STREETS I CAN FIND AND NOT STOP
AT LEAST SO HE HAD SETTLED IT HE PUT HIS OPEN HAND TO THE SIDE OF HIS HAT IN A MILITARY MANNER WHICH THAT ANGRY EYED BUTTONED UP INFLAMMATORY FACED OLD GENTLEMAN APPEARED BUT IMPERFECTLY TO APPRECIATE
BUT IT WOULDN'T PAY BY ITSELF YOU KNOW THAT'S TRUE OBSERVED THE JEW RUMINATING OR PRETENDING TO RUMINATE NO IT MIGHT NOT WHAT DO YOU THINK THEN ASKED NOAH
IT WAS VERY LUCKY IT WAS ONLY ME I DIDN'T TAKE IT STAMMERED NOAH NO LONGER STRETCHING OUT HIS LEGS LIKE AN INDEPENDENT GENTLEMAN BUT COILING THEM UP AS WELL AS HE COULD UNDER HIS CHAIR IT WAS ALL HER DOING
DO YOU REMEMBER ME THEN ASKED HIS NEW ACQUAINTANCE STOPPING IN HIS AMBLE ONE SIDED BEFORE THE STALL AND SPEAKING IN A POUNDING WAY THOUGH WITH GREAT GOOD HUMOUR
WERE ALL AS DRY AS THE DESERT WEGG WAS A KNOTTY MAN AND A CLOSE GRAINED WITH A FACE CARVED OUT OF VERY HARD MATERIAL THAT HAD JUST AS MUCH PLAY OF EXPRESSION AS A WATCHMAN'S RATTLE WHEN HE LAUGHED CERTAIN JERKS OCCURRED IN IT
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I REMAIN YOUR HUMBLE SERVT SILAS WEGG HE HAD NOT ONLY SETTLED IT WITH HIMSELF IN COURSE OF TIME THAT HE WAS ERRAND GOER BY APPOINTMENT TO THE HOUSE AT THE CORNER THOUGH HE RECEIVED SUCH COMMISSIONS NOT

DEMANDED MISTER CLAYPOLE THE KINCHINS MY DEAR SAID FAGIN IS THE YOUNG CHILDREN THAT'S SENT ON ERRANDS BY THEIR MOTHERS WITH SIXPENCES AND SHILLINGS AND THE LAY IS JUST TO TAKE THEIR MONEY AWAY
FOR THE FORMER WAS ONE OF THOSE LONG LIMBED KNOCK KNEED SHAMBLING BONY PEOPLE TO WHOM IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASSIGN ANY PRECISE AGE LOOKING AS THEY DO WHEN THEY ARE YET BOYS LIKE UNDERGROWN MEN AND WHEN THEY ARE ALMOST MEN
SAID NOAH GETTING HIS LEGS BY GRADUAL DEGREES ABROAD AGAIN
HALF A DOZEN TIMES IN A YEAR AND THEN ONLY AS SOME SERVANT'S DEPUTY BUT ALSO THAT HE WAS ONE OF THE HOUSE'S RETAINERS AND OWED VASSALAGE TO IT AND WAS BOUND TO LEAL AND LOYAL INTEREST IN IT FOR THIS REASON
HE SALUTED ALL HIS REGULAR PASSERS BY EVERY DAY AS HE SAT ON HIS STOOL BACKED UP BY THE LAMP POST AND ON THE ADAPTABLE CHARACTER OF THESE SALUTES HE GREATLY PLUMED HIMSELF THUS TO THE RECTOR HE ADDRESSED A BOW COMPOUNDED OF LAY DEFERENCE
WITH A SUBTLE AND EAGER LOOK UPON HIS FACE THAT MIGHT HAVE APPERTAINED TO SOME OLD GOBLIN SO I MEAN TO BE A GENTLEMAN SAID MISTER CLAYPOLE KICKING OUT HIS LEGS AND CONTINUING A CONVERSATION THE COMMENCEMENT OF WHICH
EYEING HIS NEW FRIEND MEANWHILE WITH MINGLED FEAR AND SUSPICION I'LL TELL YOU MORE SAID FAGIN AFTER HE HAD REASSURED THE GIRL BY DINT OF FRIENDLY NODS AND MUTTERED ENCOURAGEMENTS I HAVE GOT A FRIEND

WITH ALL THAT HAUGHTINESS AND AIR OF SUPERIORITY BECOMING NOT ONLY A MEMBER OF THE STERNER SEX BUT A GENTLEMAN WHO APPRECIATED THE DIGNITY OF A SPECIAL APPOINTMENT ON THE KINCHIN LAY
OR A HOUSE OR A MAIL COACH OR A BANK IF HE DRINKS IT REGULARLY MISTER CLAYPOLE NO SOONER HEARD THIS EXTRACT FROM HIS OWN REMARKS THAN HE FELL BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKED FROM THE JEW TO CHARLOTTE
IS IT MUCH FARTHER ASKED THE WOMAN
THAT I THINK CAN GRATIFY YOUR DARLING WISH AND PUT YOU IN THE RIGHT WAY WHERE YOU CAN TAKE WHATEVER DEPARTMENT OF THE BUSINESS YOU THINK WILL SUIT YOU BEST AT FIRST AND BE TAUGHT ALL THE OTHERS
THAT'S ENOUGH WITHOUT ANY WHY OR BECAUSE EITHER REPLIED MISTER CLAYPOLE WITH DIGNITY WELL YOU NEEDN'T BE SO CROSS SAID HIS COMPANION A PRETTY THING IT WOULD BE
HAVING REPLACED HIS TIN BOX ACCORDINGLY DID AS HE ROSE TO BAIT HIS GINGERBREAD TRAP FOR SOME OTHER DEVOTED INFANT THE SALUTE WAS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH MORNING SIR MORNING MORNING CALLS ME SIR SAID MISTER WEGG TO HIMSELF
RETORTED MISTER WEGG AGAIN APPROACHING DESPERATION I CAN'T SAY I DO WHY DON'T YOU LIKE IT I DON'T KNOW WHY I DON'T RETORTED MISTER WEGG APPROACHING FRENZY BUT I DON'T AT ALL
AND SETTING HIMSELF DOWN AT THE NEAREST TABLE ORDERED SOMETHING TO DRINK OF THE GRINNING BARNEY A PLEASANT NIGHT SIR
IT IS EXPEDIENT THAT THIS HISTORY SHOULD BESTOW SOME ATTENTION THEY WERE A MAN AND WOMAN OR PERHAPS THEY WOULD BE BETTER DESCRIBED AS A MALE AND FEMALE
LOR HOW NICE IT IS TO HEAR YER SAY SO EXCLAIMED CHARLOTTE IMPRINTING A KISS UPON HIS UGLY FACE THERE THAT'LL DO DON'T YER BE TOO AFFECTIONATE IN CASE I'M CROSS WITH YER
REPLIED FAGIN SHOULD I HAVE TO HAND OVER SAID NOAH SLAPPING HIS BREECHES POCKET IT COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE DONE WITHOUT REPLIED FAGIN IN A MOST DECIDED MANNER
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD ANSWER MY PURPOSE AIN'T THERE ANY OTHER LINE OPEN STOP SAID FAGIN LAYING HIS HAND ON NOAH'S KNEE THE KINCHIN LAY WHAT'S THAT
MISTER WEGG MADE ANSWER IN A SORT OF DESPERATION OCCASIONED BY THE SINGULARITY OF THE QUESTION HE HASN'T REPEATED THE OTHER TO HIS KNOTTED STICK AS HE GAVE IT A HUG HE HASN'T GOT HA HA TO KEEP IT WARM
AS SOME FANCIED APPEARANCE INDUCED HIM TO BELIEVE IT TOO PUBLIC FOR HIS PURPOSE AT LENGTH HE STOPPED IN FRONT OF ONE MORE HUMBLE IN APPEARANCE AND MORE DIRTY THAN ANY HE HAD YET SEEN AND HAVING CROSSED OVER AND SURVEYED IT
THE UNFOLDED CLOTHES HORSE DISPLAYED A CHOICE COLLECTION OF HALFPENNY BALLADS AND BECAME A SCREEN AND THE STOOL PLANTED WITHIN IT BECAME HIS POST FOR THE REST OF THE DAY ALL WEATHERS SAW THE MAN AT THE POST
SUGGESTED FAGIN AH SOMETHING OF THAT SORT REPLIED NOAH WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD SUIT ME NOW SOMETHING NOT TOO TRYING FOR THE STRENGTH AND NOT VERY DANGEROUS YOU KNOW THAT'S THE SORT OF THING
SHELTERLESS FRAGMENTS OF STRAW AND PAPER GOT UP REVOLVING STORMS THERE WHEN THE MAIN STREET WAS AT PEACE AND THE WATER CART AS IF IT WERE DRUNK OR SHORT SIGHTED CAME BLUNDERING AND JOLTING ROUND IT
FIXED IN THE WALL OF THE LAST NAMED APARTMENT ABOUT FIVE FEET FROM ITS FLOORING COULD NOT ONLY LOOK DOWN UPON ANY GUESTS IN THE BACK ROOM WITHOUT ANY GREAT HAZARD OF BEING OBSERVED THE GLASS BEING IN A DARK ANGLE OF THE WALL BETWEEN WHICH
OH NOW WHAT PURSUED THE OLD FELLOW IN AN INQUISITIVE MANNER CARRYING HIS KNOTTED STICK IN HIS LEFT ARM AS IF IT WERE A BABY WHAT DO THEY ALLOW YOU NOW IT'S JOB WORK THAT I DO FOR OUR HOUSE
OVER THE HOUSE ITSELF HE EXERCISED THE SAME IMAGINARY POWER AS OVER ITS INHABITANTS AND THEIR AFFAIRS HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN IT THE LENGTH OF A PIECE OF FAT
AND A LARGE UPRIGHT BEAM THE OBSERVER HAD TO THRUST HIMSELF BUT COULD BY APPLYING HIS EAR TO THE PARTITION
FAGIN APPEARED TO RECEIVE THIS COMMUNICATION WITH GREAT INTEREST MOUNTING A STOOL HE CAUTIOUSLY APPLIED HIS EYE TO THE PANE OF GLASS FROM WHICH SECRET POST HE COULD SEE MISTER CLAYPOLE
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY NOT WHEN IT'S IN A NOTE YOU CAN'T GET RID OF RETORTED FAGIN NUMBER AND DATE TAKEN I SUPPOSE PAYMENT STOPPED AT THE BANK AH IT'S NOT WORTH MUCH TO HIM IT'LL HAVE TO GO ABROAD
ALL STRAPPED TOGETHER SEPARATING THESE THE BOARD AND TRESTLES BECAME A COUNTER THE BASKET SUPPLIED THE FEW SMALL LOTS OF FRUIT AND SWEETS THAT HE OFFERED FOR SALE UPON IT AND BECAME A FOOT WARMER
SAID THE WOMAN DESPONDINGLY NEVER MIND WHETHER THEY'RE TWO MILE OFF OR TWENTY SAID NOAH CLAYPOLE FOR HE IT WAS BUT GET UP AND COME ON OR I'LL KICK YER AND SO I GIVE YER NOTICE
WHICH HAD BEEN EXPOSED FOR THE DAY'S SALE HE HAD TAKEN A TIN BOX FROM UNDER HIS STOOL TO PRODUCE A RELAY OF THOSE DREADFUL SPECIMENS AND WAS GOING TO LOOK IN AT THE LID WHEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF PAUSING OH HERE YOU ARE AGAIN
CHARLOTTE SEE TO THEM BUNDLES THIS MANDATE WHICH HAD BEEN DELIVERED WITH GREAT MAJESTY WAS OBEYED WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST DEMUR
WITH THE PACKAGES WHILE NOAH HELD THE DOOR OPEN AND WATCHED HER OUT SHE'S KEPT TOLERABLY WELL UNDER AIN'T SHE HE ASKED AS HE RESUMED HIS SEAT IN THE TONE OF A KEEPER WHO HAD TAMED SOME WILD ANIMAL
WITH THESE INJUNCTIONS HE PUSHED THE RATTLING DOOR WITH HIS SHOULDER AND ENTERED THE HOUSE FOLLOWED BY HIS COMPANION THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE BAR BUT A YOUNG JEW WHO WITH HIS TWO ELBOWS ON THE COUNTER
YOU'VE HIT THE RIGHT NAIL UPON THE HEAD AND ARE AS SAFE HERE AS YOU COULD BE THERE IS NOT A SAFER PLACE IN ALL THIS TOWN THAN IS THE CRIPPLES THAT IS WHEN I LIKE TO MAKE IT SO AND I HAVE TAKEN A FANCY TO YOU AND THE YOUNG WOMAN
IT GAVE YOU THE FACE ACHE TO LOOK AT HIS APPLES THE STOMACH ACHE TO LOOK AT HIS ORANGES THE TOOTH ACHE TO LOOK AT HIS NUTS
THIS IS TO BE ACCEPTED IN A DOUBLE SENSE FOR HE CONTRIVED A BACK TO HIS WOODEN STOOL BY PLACING IT AGAINST THE LAMP POST WHEN THE WEATHER WAS WET HE PUT UP HIS UMBRELLA OVER HIS STOCK IN TRADE NOT OVER HIMSELF
YOU UNDERSTAND OH YES I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY REPLIED FAGIN TELLING THE TRUTH FOR ONCE GOOD NIGHT GOOD NIGHT

TAKING COLD BEEF FROM THE DISH AND PORTER FROM THE POT AND ADMINISTERING HOMEOPATHIC DOSES OF BOTH TO CHARLOTTE WHO SAT PATIENTLY BY EATING AND DRINKING AT HIS PLEASURE AHA HE WHISPERED
HAS THE VERY BEST SOCIETY IN THE PROFESSION REGULAR TOWN MADERS ASKED MISTER CLAYPOLE NOT A COUNTRYMAN AMONG EM AND I DON'T THINK HE'D TAKE YOU EVEN ON MY RECOMMENDATION IF HE DIDN'T RUN RATHER SHORT OF ASSISTANTS JUST NOW
UNSTRAPPING IT FROM THE WOMAN'S SHOULDERS
WHERE THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING ERRANDS AND YOU CAN UPSET AS MANY KINCHINS AS YOU WANT ANY HOUR IN THE DAY HA HA HA WITH THIS FAGIN POKED MISTER CLAYPOLE IN THE SIDE AND THEY JOINED IN A BURST OF LAUGHTER
AND BARNEY HAD ONLY JUST RETURNED FROM MAKING THE COMMUNICATION ABOVE RELATED WHEN FAGIN IN THE COURSE OF HIS EVENING'S BUSINESS CAME INTO THE BAR TO INQUIRE AFTER SOME OF HIS YOUNG PUPILS HUSH SAID BARNEY

THEN SHE ASKS HIM WHY IN THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF HIS BASE SPECULATION HE DOES NOT TAKE HER LIFE WITH HIS OWN HAND UNDER THE PRESENT FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES THEN SHE CRIES AGAIN THEN SHE IS ENRAGED AGAIN AND MAKES SOME MENTION OF SWINDLERS FINALLY SHE SITS DOWN
AND AN UNACKNOWLEDGED MEMBER OF THAT GENTLEMAN'S FAMILY WHOM LADY TIPPINS SURVEYING THROUGH HER EYE GLASS CONSIDERS A FINE MAN AND QUITE A CATCH

THAT THE LATTER IN THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR APPEARS TO BE CONTEMPLATING ALL THE WRONG HE WOULD LIKE TO DO PARTICULARLY TO THE PRESENT COMPANY IN WHICH STATE OF AFFAIRS THE USUAL CEREMONIES RATHER DROOP AND FLAG AND THE SPLENDID CAKE WHEN CUT BY THE FAIR HAND OF THE BRIDE
DO I MEAN TO TELL YOU DO I MEAN TO TELL YOU WHAT THAT YOU ARE A MAN OF PROPERTY NO THEN YOU MARRIED ME ON FALSE PRETENCES SO BE IT NEXT COMES WHAT YOU MEAN TO SAY
OF BABY'S GODFATHER AND INDEED VENEERING IS MUCH RELIEVED IN MIND TO FIND THAT PODSNAP BETRAYS NO JEALOUSY OF TWEMLOW'S ELEVATION SO IT HAS COME TO PASS THAT THE SPRING VAN IS STREWING FLOWERS ON THE ROSY HOURS AND ON THE STAIRCASE
DON'T BE BETRAYED INTO DOING SO AGAIN BECAUSE I HAVE A DEVIL OF A TEMPER MYSELF SO THE HAPPY PAIR WITH THIS HOPEFUL MARRIAGE CONTRACT THUS SIGNED SEALED AND DELIVERED REPAIR HOMEWARD

THE MALIGNANT STAR OF THE ANALYTICAL HAS PRE ORDAINED THAT PAIN AND RIDICULE SHALL BEFALL HIM FOR HE STANDING ON THE DOORSTEPS TO GRACE THE DEPARTURE IS SUDDENLY CAUGHT
MISERABLE IS THAT THE WAY YOU DO YOUR DUTY BEYOND AN IMPRESSION THAT HE IS TO SIT UPON MY KNEE AND BE SECONDED AT SOME POINT OF THE SOLEMNITIES

THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM TALK AND LAUGH APART AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THEIR MANNER AND THE BUFFERS WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH THE DISHES WITH SYSTEMATIC PERSEVERANCE
FOR THE POOR LITTLE HARMLESS GENTLEMAN ONCE HAD HIS FANCY LIKE THE REST OF US AND SHE DIDN'T ANSWER AS SHE OFTEN DOES NOT AND HE THINKS THE ADORABLE BRIDESMAID IS LIKE THE FANCY AS SHE WAS THEN WHICH SHE IS NOT AT ALL
WHO WHILE PERFORMING THE CEREMONY WAS GRACIOUSLY PLEASED TO OBSERVE WHAT WHAT WHAT WHO WHO WHO WHY WHY WHY BEGINS TO BE DYED AND VARNISHED FOR THE INTERESTING OCCASION
VENEERING'S HOUSE REACHED DRAWING ROOMS MOST MAGNIFICENT HERE THE PODSNAPS AWAIT THE HAPPY PARTY MISTER PODSNAP WITH HIS HAIR BRUSHES MADE THE MOST OF THAT IMPERIAL ROCKING HORSE MISSUS PODSNAP MAJESTICALLY SKITTISH HERE TOO ARE BOOTS AND BREWER

AND WHEN I LOOK BACK THE BRIDE CRIES INTERRUPTING AND WHEN YOU LOOK BACK YOU WONDER HOW YOU CAN HAVE BEEN YOU'LL EXCUSE THE WORD MOST CERTAINLY WITH SO MUCH REASON SUCH A FOOL AS TO TAKE ME
WHILE THE LOVES AND GRACES HAVE BEEN PREPARING THIS TORCH FOR HYMEN WHICH IS TO BE KINDLED TO MORROW MISTER TWEMLOW HAS SUFFERED MUCH IN HIS MIND
POKEY UNKNOWNS AMAZED TO FIND HOW INTIMATELY THEY KNOW VENEERING PLUCK UP SPIRIT FOLD THEIR ARMS AND BEGIN TO CONTRADICT HIM BEFORE BREAKFAST WHAT TIME MISSUS VENEERING CARRYING BABY DRESSED AS A BRIDESMAID FLITS ABOUT AMONG THE COMPANY
CRYING ON A BLOCK OF STONE AND IS IN ALL THE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN HUMOURS OF HER SEX AT ONCE PENDING HER CHANGES THOSE AFORESAID MARKS IN HIS FACE HAVE COME AND GONE NOW HERE NOW THERE LIKE WHITE STEPS OF A PIPE ON WHICH THE DIABOLICAL PERFORMER HAS PLAYED A TUNE

MORTIMER YOU WRETCH SAYS LADY TIPPINS TURNING THE EYEGLASS ABOUT AND ABOUT WHERE IS YOUR CHARGE THE BRIDEGROOM
IF WHEN THOSE INFERNAL FINGER MARKS WERE ON THE WHITE AND BREATHLESS COUNTENANCE OF ALFRED LAMMLE ESQUIRE THEY DENOTED THAT HE CONCEIVED THE PURPOSE OF SUBDUING HIS DEAR WIFE MISSUS ALFRED LAMMLE BY AT ONCE DIVESTING HER OF ANY LINGERING REALITY OR PRETENCE OF SELF RESPECT
BECAUSE I COULDN'T TAKE SO MUCH UPON MYSELF WHEN I HAVE RESPECTED FAMILY FRIENDS TO REMEMBER SECONDLY
OH THINKS TWEMLOW WITH HIS EYES WANDERING THEN THERE ARE THREE OF US AND SHE'S THE OTHER MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD RESUMES VENEERING WHOM YOU BOTH KNOW IS OUT OF TOWN BUT HE WRITES IN HIS WHIMSICAL MANNER
WITH A SMACK AND A RELISH
SPLENDID BRACELET PRODUCED BY VENEERING BEFORE GOING DOWN AND CLASPED UPON THE ARM OF BRIDE YET NOBODY SEEMS TO THINK MUCH MORE OF THE VENEERINGS THAN IF THEY WERE A TOLERABLE LANDLORD AND LANDLADY DOING THE THING IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS AT SO MUCH A HEAD
AS THIS HAPPENS TO BE TRUE MISSUS LAMMLE IS THROWN ON THE FEMININE RESOURCE OF SAYING I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU UTTERED OR DID NOT UTTER

AND THAT IF THE FANCY HAD NOT MARRIED SOME ONE ELSE FOR MONEY BUT HAD MARRIED HIM FOR LOVE HE AND SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY WHICH THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AND THAT SHE HAS A TENDERNESS FOR HIM STILL WHEREAS HER TOUGHNESS IS A PROVERB
BROODING OVER THE FIRE WITH HIS DRIED LITTLE HEAD IN HIS DRIED LITTLE HANDS AND HIS DRIED LITTLE ELBOWS ON HIS DRIED LITTLE KNEES TWEMLOW IS MELANCHOLY NO ADORABLE TO BEAR ME COMPANY HERE THINKS HE NO ADORABLE AT THE CLUB
IN A NUT SHELL THERE'S THE STATE OF THE CASE YOU SOUGHT ME OUT TUT
AGAIN THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE QUESTION MISSUS LAMMLE WHAT DO YOU PRETEND TO BELIEVE SO YOU FIRST DECEIVE ME AND THEN INSULT ME CRIES THE LADY WITH A HEAVING BOSOM
TO SET THOSE BLARING IMAGES SO HIGH AND TO CAUSE US SMALLER VERMIN AS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HENBANE OR OPIUM TO CRY OUT NIGHT AND DAY RELIEVE US OF OUR MONEY SCATTER IT FOR US BUY US AND SELL US RUIN US ONLY WE BESEECH YE TAKE RANK AMONG THE POWERS OF THE EARTH AND FATTEN ON US
PUTTING IT ON ME THE UNMANLY DISINGENUOUSNESS MISTER LAMMLE STOPS RELEASES HIS WHISKERS AND LOOKS AT HER THE WHAT MISSUS LAMMLE HAUGHTILY REPLIES WITHOUT STOPPING AND WITHOUT LOOKING BACK THE MEANNESS
THIRTY SHILLINGS A YARD VEIL FIFTEEN POUND POCKET HANDKERCHIEF A PRESENT BRIDESMAIDS
MISTER LAMMLE TAKES HIS GINGEROUS WHISKERS IN HIS LEFT HAND AND BRINGING THEM TOGETHER FROWNS FURTIVELY AT HIS BELOVED OUT OF A THICK GINGEROUS BUSH DO I MEAN TO SAY
WE AGREE TO KEEP OUR OWN SECRET AND TO WORK TOGETHER IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR OWN SCHEMES WHAT SCHEMES ANY SCHEME THAT WILL BRING US MONEY BY OUR OWN SCHEMES I MEAN OUR JOINT INTEREST AGREED
IS NOW AMONG US THAT FRIEND IS TWEMLOW CERTAINLY FROM PODSNAP THAT FRIEND VENEERING REPEATS WITH GREATER FIRMNESS IS OUR DEAR GOOD TWEMLOW
FOR THE DISCUSSION OF AN INTERESTING FAMILY TOPIC THE LAST THREE WORDS DOUBLY UNDERLINED AND POINTED WITH A NOTE OF ADMIRATION AND TWEMLOW REPLYING NOT ENGAGED AND MORE THAN DELIGHTED
WORN OUT BY WORRY AND EXCITEMENT AS SHE TELLS HER DEAR MISTER TWEMLOW
THE MATURE YOUNG LADY IN THE LIGHT OF A SISTER AND ALFRED LAMMLE THE MATURE YOUNG GENTLEMAN IN THE LIGHT OF A BROTHER TWEMLOW HAS ASKED HIM WHETHER HE WENT TO SCHOOL AS A JUNIOR WITH ALFRED HE HAS ANSWERED NOT EXACTLY WHETHER SOPHRONIA WAS ADOPTED BY HIS MOTHER
AND TO COME LIKE ADORABLE RECRUITS ENLISTED BY A SERGEANT NOT PRESENT FOR ON ARRIVING AT THE VENEERING DEPOT THEY ARE IN A BARRACK OF STRANGERS SO TWEMLOW GOES HOME TO DUKE STREET SAINT JAMES'S TO TAKE A PLATE OF MUTTON BROTH WITH A CHOP IN IT
BETIMES NEXT MORNING THAT HORRIBLE OLD LADY TIPPINS
SAYING ALOUD WHEN THEY ARE PROFFERED TO HER NO NO NO NOT FOR ME TAKE IT AWAY AS WITH A SET PURPOSE OF IMPLYING A MISGIVING THAT IF NOURISHED UPON SIMILAR MEATS SHE MIGHT COME TO BE LIKE THAT CHARMER WHICH WOULD BE A FATAL CONSUMMATION
TO SO GREAT AN EXTENT UPON TRUST BUT THE FOLLY IS COMMITTED ON BOTH SIDES I CANNOT GET RID OF YOU YOU CANNOT GET RID OF ME WHAT FOLLOWS SHAME AND MISERY THE BRIDE BITTERLY REPLIES I DON'T KNOW A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING FOLLOWS
IN THE FRIENDLIEST MANNER HE IS MAKING HIMSELF QUITE AT HOME WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE EXECUTING A STATUETTE OF THE COLOSSUS AT RHODES TWEMLOW HAS BEFORE NOTICED IN HIS FEEBLE WAY HOW SOON THE VENEERING GUESTS BECOME INFECTED WITH THE VENEERING FICTION
WE COME SMOOTHLY TO THIRDLY YOU HAVE CALLED ME AN ADVENTURER SOPHRONIA SO I AM IN PLAIN UNCOMPLIMENTARY ENGLISH SO I AM SO ARE YOU MY DEAR SO ARE MANY PEOPLE
OR I OUGHT RATHER TO SAY
DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THEN SOPHRONIA
AND TAKE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE OUT OF THE SPLENDID FURNITURE AND SO LADY TIPPINS
A WASTE A WASTE A WASTE MY TWEMLOW
THAT THE POKEY UNKNOWNS SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN BEING UNIMPRESSIBLE THEY PERSIST IN NOT BEING FRIGHTENED BY THE GOLD AND SILVER CAMELS AND THEY ARE BANDED TOGETHER TO DEFY THE ELABORATELY CHASED ICE PAILS THEY EVEN SEEM TO UNITE IN SOME VAGUE UTTERANCE OF THE SENTIMENT
AND OMINOUS MARKS HAVE COME TO LIGHT ABOUT HIS NOSE AS IF THE FINGER OF THE VERY DEVIL HIMSELF HAD WITHIN THE LAST FEW MOMENTS TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE BUT HE HAS REPRESSIVE POWER AND SHE HAS NONE THROW IT AWAY HE COOLLY RECOMMENDS AS TO THE PARASOL
INCLUDING LADY TIPPINS'S YAWNING FALLING ASLEEP AND WAKING INSENSIBLE AND THERE IS HURRIED PREPARATION FOR THE NUPTIAL JOURNEY TO THE ISLE OF WIGHT AND THE OUTER AIR TEEMS WITH BRASS BANDS AND SPECTATORS
BECAUSE IT IS IDENTICAL WITH THE PAST KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE OF YOU AND IN TWITTING ME YOU TWIT YOURSELF AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOU DO IT WITH THIS GOOD UNDERSTANDING ESTABLISHED BETWEEN US IT IS BETTER NEVER DONE TO WIND UP ALL YOU HAVE SHOWN TEMPER TODAY SOPHRONIA
THAT IF THE REVEREND BLANK BLANK AND THE REVEREND DASH DASH FAIL AFTER THIS INTRODUCTION TO BECOME ENROLLED IN THE LIST OF VENEERING'S DEAREST AND OLDEST FRIENDS THEY WILL HAVE NONE BUT THEMSELVES TO THANK FOR IT AFTER WHICH APPEARS SOPHRONIA
AT LENGTH COMES TO BE EXPECTED BY THE COMPANY WHO MAKE EMBARRASSING PAUSES WHEN IT IS FALLING DUE AND BY WAITING FOR IT RENDER IT MORE EMPHATIC WHEN IT COMES THE STONEY AUNT HAS LIKEWISE AN INJURIOUS WAY OF REJECTING ALL DISHES WHEREOF LADY TIPPINS PARTAKES
AWARE OF HER ENEMY LADY TIPPINS TRIES A YOUTHFUL SALLY OR TWO AND TRIES THE EYE GLASS BUT FROM THE IMPENETRABLE CAP AND SNORTING ARMOUR OF THE STONEY AUNT ALL WEAPONS REBOUND POWERLESS ANOTHER OBJECTIONABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IS
NOT HOWEVER THAT HE HAS THE LEAST NOTION OF ITS BEING HIS OWN CASE OUR FRIENDS ALFRED AND SOPHRONIA PURSUES VENEERING THE VEILED PROPHET OUR FRIENDS ALFRED AND SOPHRONIA
BUT MY DEAR PODSNAP QUOTH VENEERING THERE IS A TRIED FRIEND OF OUR FAMILY WHO I THINK AND HOPE YOU WILL AGREE WITH ME PODSNAP IS THE FRIEND ON WHOM THIS AGREEABLE DUTY ALMOST NATURALLY DEVOLVES THAT FRIEND
AND THE TWO OTHER BUFFERS EACH BUFFER WITH A FLOWER IN HIS BUTTON HOLE HIS HAIR CURLED AND HIS GLOVES BUTTONED ON TIGHT APPARENTLY COME PREPARED
SO WE AGREE TO KEEP THE FACT TO OURSELVES YOU AGREE IF IT IS POSSIBLE I DO POSSIBLE
BE VENEERING'S OLDEST FRIENDS WARDS OF HIS PERHAPS YET THAT CAN SCARCELY BE FOR THEY ARE OLDER THAN HIMSELF
YOU TELL ME TELL ME FORSOOTH SHE AFFECTS NOT TO KNOW THAT HIS EYES ARE FASTENED ON HER AS SHE DROOPS HER HEAD AGAIN BUT HER WHOLE FIGURE REVEALS THAT SHE KNOWS IT UNEASILY ENOUGH OF THIS COME DO YOU HEAR GET UP
SHE HAS A REPUTATION FOR GIVING SMART ACCOUNTS OF THINGS AND SHE MUST BE AT THESE PEOPLE'S EARLY MY DEAR TO LOSE NOTHING OF THE FUN WHEREABOUT IN THE BONNET AND DRAPERY ANNOUNCED BY HER NAME ANY FRAGMENT OF THE REAL WOMAN MAY BE CONCEALED
AND HE MUTTERS SOMETHING BUT CHECKS HIMSELF QUESTION FOR QUESTION IT IS MY TURN AGAIN MISSUS LAMMLE WHAT MADE YOU SUPPOSE ME A MAN OF PROPERTY YOU MADE ME SUPPOSE YOU SO
THOSE LOVELY BEINGS BECOME EACH ONE OF HER OWN ACCOUNT DEPRECIATINGLY CONTEMPLATIVE OF THE MILLINERY PRESENT WHILE THE BRIDEGROOM'S MAN EXHAUSTED IN THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR APPEARS TO BE IMPROVING THE OCCASION BY PENITENTIALLY CONTEMPLATING ALL THE WRONG HE HAS EVER DONE
FOLLOWS EVERY LIVELY REMARK MADE BY THAT DEAR CREATURE WITH AN AUDIBLE SNORT WHICH MAY BE REFERABLE TO A CHRONIC COLD IN THE HEAD BUT MAY ALSO BE REFERABLE TO INDIGNATION AND CONTEMPT
ANOTHER DISMAL CIRCUMSTANCE IS THAT VENEERING HAVING THE CAPTIVATING TIPPINS ON ONE SIDE OF HIM AND THE BRIDE'S AUNT ON THE OTHER FINDS IT IMMENSELY DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE PEACE FOR MEDUSA
AND TURNS UPON HIM DON'T PUT IT UPON ME SIR I ASK YOU DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME MISTER LAMMLE FALLS SILENT AGAIN AND THEY WALK AS BEFORE MISSUS LAMMLE OPENS HER NOSTRILS AND BITES HER UNDER LIP
YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS WITH IT WHEREUPON SHE CALLS HIM IN HER RAGE A DELIBERATE VILLAIN AND SO CASTS THE BROKEN THING FROM HER AS THAT IT STRIKES HIM IN FALLING THE FINGER MARKS ARE SOMETHING WHITER FOR THE INSTANT BUT HE WALKS ON AT HER SIDE
YIELDING TO HIS HAND SHE RISES AND THEY WALK AGAIN BUT THIS TIME WITH THEIR FACES TURNED TOWARDS THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE MISSUS LAMMLE WE HAVE BOTH BEEN DECEIVING AND WE HAVE BOTH BEEN DECEIVED
AND WHOSE LEFT HAND APPEARS TO BE IN A STATE OF ACUTE RHEUMATISM BUT IS IN FACT VOLUNTARILY DOUBLED UP TO ACT AS A MONEY BOX AND NOW VENEERING SHOOTS OUT OF THE STUDY WHEREIN HE IS ACCUSTOMED WHEN CONTEMPLATIVE
UNITED IN THE BONDS OF MATRIMONY ALFRED LAMMLE ESQUIRE OF SACKVILLE STREET PICCADILLY TO SOPHRONIA ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE LATE HORATIO AKERSHEM ESQUIRE OF YORKSHIRE ALSO HOW THE FAIR BRIDE WAS MARRIED FROM THE HOUSE OF HAMILTON VENEERING
AND THAT THEY HAVE WALKED IN A MOODY HUMOUR FOR THE LADY HAS PRODDED LITTLE SPIRTING HOLES IN THE DAMP SAND BEFORE HER WITH HER PARASOL AND THE GENTLEMAN HAS TRAILED HIS STICK AFTER HIM
WHICH MAKES SEVEN TWEMLOW THOUGHT AND CONFIDENTIALLY RETIRING WITH HIM INTO THE CONSERVATORY IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT VENEERING IS HIS CO TRUSTEE AND THAT THEY ARE ARRANGING ABOUT THE FORTUNE BUFFERS ARE EVEN OVERHEARD TO WHISPER
ESQUIRE OF STUCCONIA AND WAS GIVEN AWAY BY MELVIN TWEMLOW ESQUIRE OF DUKE STREET SAINT JAMES'S SECOND COUSIN TO LORD SNIGSWORTH OF SNIGSWORTHY PARK WHILE PERUSING WHICH COMPOSITION TWEMLOW MAKES SOME OPAQUE APPROACH TO PERCEIVING
IF YOU HAD WAITED A MOMENT YOU TOO ARE DISAPPOINTED AND CUT A POOR FIGURE AN INJURED FIGURE YOU ARE NOW COOL ENOUGH SOPHRONIA TO SEE THAT YOU CAN'T BE INJURED WITHOUT MY BEING EQUALLY INJURED AND THAT THEREFORE THE MERE WORD IS NOT TO THE PURPOSE
DO YOU PRETEND TO BELIEVE MISSUS LAMMLE RESUMES STERNLY WHEN YOU TALK OF MY MARRYING YOU FOR WORLDLY ADVANTAGES THAT IT WAS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF REASONABLE PROBABILITY
HE HAS ANSWERED NOT PRECISELY SO TWEMLOW'S HAND HAS GONE TO HIS FOREHEAD WITH A LOST AIR BUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS AGO TWEMLOW SITTING OVER HIS NEWSPAPER AND OVER HIS DRY TOAST AND WEAK TEA
AND HIS TRUST IS NOT A VERY DIFFICULT ONE FOR IT IS ONLY AN ANNUITY OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN POUNDS I THINK THERE ARE SOME ODD SHILLINGS OR PENCE IF YOU ARE VERY PARTICULAR MISTER LAMMLE BESTOWS A BY NO MEANS LOVING LOOK UPON THE PARTNER OF HIS JOYS AND SORROWS
AND FEELS AVERSE TO MY GIVING AWAY ANYBODY UNTIL BABY IS OLD ENOUGH TO BE MARRIED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE DID PODSNAP INQUIRES OF MISSUS VENEERING MY DEAR MISTER PODSNAP IT'S VERY FOOLISH I KNOW BUT I HAVE AN INSTINCTIVE PRESENTIMENT THAT IF HAMILTON
OSCILLATE ON MYSTERIOUS BUSINESS BETWEEN LONDON AND PARIS AND BE GREAT WHERE DOES HE COME FROM SHARES WHERE IS HE GOING TO SHARES WHAT ARE HIS TASTES SHARES HAS HE ANY PRINCIPLES SHARES
AN OILCAKE FED STYLE OF BUSINESS GENTLEMAN WITH MOONEY SPECTACLES AND AN OBJECT OF MUCH INTEREST
SHE BURSTS INTO TEARS DECLARING HERSELF THE WRETCHEDEST THE MOST DECEIVED THE WORST USED OF WOMEN THEN SHE SAYS THAT IF SHE HAD THE COURAGE TO KILL HERSELF SHE WOULD DO IT THEN SHE CALLS HIM VILE IMPOSTOR
EMITTING FLASHES OF MANY COLOURED LIGHTNING FROM DIAMONDS EMERALDS AND RUBIES THE ANALYTICAL IN COURSE OF TIME ACHIEVING WHAT HE FEELS TO BE DUE TO HIMSELF IN BRINGING TO A DIGNIFIED CONCLUSION SEVERAL QUARRELS HE HAS ON HAND WITH THE PASTRYCOOK'S MEN
WITH A HEAVY SHOE WHICH A BUFFER IN THE HALL CHAMPAGNE FLUSHED AND WILD OF AIM HAS BORROWED ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT FROM THE PASTRYCOOK'S PORTER TO CAST AFTER THE DEPARTING PAIR AS AN AUSPICIOUS OMEN SO THEY ALL GO UP AGAIN INTO THE GORGEOUS DRAWING ROOMS
I HAVE ORIGINATED NOTHING THE DOUBLE EDGED QUESTION WAS YOURS WAS MINE THE BRIDE REPEATS AND HER PARASOL BREAKS IN HER ANGRY HAND
WHAT SQUEEZES HIM INTO PARLIAMENT SHARES PERHAPS HE NEVER OF HIMSELF ACHIEVED SUCCESS IN ANYTHING NEVER ORIGINATED ANYTHING NEVER PRODUCED ANYTHING SUFFICIENT ANSWER TO ALL SHARES O MIGHTY SHARES
MAY BE CROWNED WITH FLOWERS THE MATURE YOUNG LADY IS A LADY OF PROPERTY THE MATURE YOUNG GENTLEMAN IS A GENTLEMAN OF PROPERTY HE INVESTS HIS PROPERTY HE GOES IN A CONDESCENDING AMATEURISH WAY INTO THE CITY
NO THEN YOU MARRIED ME ON FALSE PRETENCES IF YOU WERE SO DULL A FORTUNE HUNTER THAT YOU DECEIVED YOURSELF OR IF YOU WERE SO GREEDY AND GRASPING THAT YOU WERE OVER WILLING TO BE DECEIVED BY APPEARANCES IS IT MY FAULT YOU ADVENTURER THE LADY DEMANDS WITH GREAT ASPERITY
IS PERHAPS KNOWN TO HER MAID BUT YOU COULD EASILY BUY ALL YOU SEE OF HER IN BOND STREET OR YOU MIGHT SCALP HER AND PEEL HER AND SCRAPE HER AND MAKE TWO LADY TIPPINSES OUT OF HER AND YET NOT PENETRATE TO THE GENUINE ARTICLE
RETURNS MORTIMER EUGENE IS ALSO IN ATTENDANCE WITH A PERVADING AIR UPON HIM OF HAVING PRESUPPOSED THE CEREMONY TO BE A FUNERAL AND OF BEING DISAPPOINTED
THE ANALYTICAL WHO OBJECTS AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE TO EVERYTHING THAT OCCURS ON THE PREMISES NECESSARILY OBJECTS TO THE MATCH BUT HIS CONSENT HAS BEEN DISPENSED WITH AND A SPRING VAN IS DELIVERING ITS LOAD OF GREENHOUSE PLANTS AT THE DOOR
BUT POSITIVENESS AND THE FATE OF EVERY POSITIVE STATEMENT IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY TO THINK OF DAMNED STONES RAISING AN OUTCRY AGAINST A SENTENCE OF EXCLUSION BUT SUBJECTIVELY
HE GIVES EARLIER DATES BUT I PRACTICE EXCLUSIONS MYSELF IN THE REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIXTY THREE
ONE OF THE MOST RESOLUTE OF THE EXCLUSIONISTS NEW YORK TIMES MARCH TWELFTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THAT THE SUBSTANCE HAD BEEN EXAMINED AND ANALYZED BY PROFESSOR SMITH ACCORDING TO WHOM IT GAVE EVERY INDICATION OF BEING THE
BEFORE THE ERUPTION OCCURRED
IF THE WHOLE WORLD SHOULD SEEM TO COMBINE AGAINST YOU IT IS ONLY UNREAL COMBINATION OR INTERMEDIATENESS TO UNITY AND DISUNITY EVERY RESISTANCE IS ITSELF DIVIDED INTO PARTS RESISTING ONE ANOTHER THE SIMPLEST STRATEGY SEEMS TO BE
ONE SMILES IN MONTANA IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FELL SNOWFLAKES FIFTEEN INCHES ACROSS AND EIGHT INCHES THICK MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW NINETEEN FIFTEEN SEVENTY THREE
IT IS SAID THAT THESE PHENOMENA WERE CAUSED BY PARTICLES OF VOLCANIC DUST THAT WERE CAST HIGH IN THE AIR BY KRAKATOA THIS IS THE EXPLANATION THAT WAS AGREED UPON IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE BUT FOR SEVEN YEARS THE ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA CONTINUED
IT HAD BEEN EXAMINED AND DESCRIBED BY PROFESSOR GRAVES FORMERLY LECTURER AT DARTMOUTH COLLEGE IT WAS AN OBJECT THAT HAD UPON IT A NAP SIMILAR TO THAT OF MILLED CLOTH UPON REMOVING THIS NAP
BUT IN CONFORMITY WITH A GENERAL ATTEMPT TO HOLD OUT FOR ISOLATION OF THIS EARTH THIS IS ATTEMPTED POSITIVENESS WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT SCIENCE CAN NO MORE SUCCEED THAN
HIS FEELING WAS OF CONVICTION THAT PROPRIETY HAD BEEN RE ESTABLISHED OR THAT THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN SOLVED AS HE EXPRESSES IT KNOWING MISTER BRANDEIS WELL HE HAD CALLED UPON THAT UPHOLDER OF RESPECTABILITY
SO AUTHORITATIVELY FALLING STONES WERE DAMNED THE STOCK MEANS OF EXCLUSION REMAINED THE EXPLANATION OF LIGHTNING THAT WAS SEEN TO STRIKE SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE
THAT THEY WERE SEEN IN NATAL SOUTH AFRICA SIX MONTHS BEFORE THE ERUPTION INERTIA AND ITS INHOSPITALITY OR
BEFORE EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE WROTE A GREAT DEAL UPON HIS THEORY OF COSMIC DUST AND PROFESSOR CLEVELAND ABBE CONTENDED AGAINST THE KRAKATOAN EXPLANATION BUT THAT THIS IS THE ORTHODOXY OF THE MAIN BODY OF SCIENTISTS
OF EXTERNALLY DERIVED SUBSTANCES THAT FALL UPON THIS EARTH AS THAT THEY ARE INIMICAL TO ALL DATA DISCORDANT WITH A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE SUCH PHENOMENA
GRAYISH OR WHITISH GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE IS NOT NOSTOC AND IS NOT SPAWN IF OCCURRING IN TIMES UNSEASONABLE FOR SPAWN THE KENTUCKY PHENOMENON
THAT HAS EVER BEEN ACCEPTABLY TRACED TO TERRESTRIAL ORIGIN FALLING STONES HAD TO BE UNDAMNED
WHEN THE TESTIMONY WAS TOO GOOD THAT IT HAD FALLEN
ALSO THERE WERE BLUE MOONS
OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE TWO POUNDERS AUTHENTICATED AND SIX POUNDERS REPORTED AT SERINGAPATAM INDIA ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FELL A HAILSTONE
YOU CAN OPPOSE AN ABSURDITY ONLY WITH SOME OTHER ABSURDITY BUT SCIENCE IS ESTABLISHED PREPOSTEROUSNESS WE DIVIDE ALL INTELLECTION THE OBVIOUSLY PREPOSTEROUSNESS AND THE ESTABLISHED BUT KRAKATOA
OR THE SPIRIT OR HOPE OR AMBITION OF THE COSMOS WHICH WE CALL ATTEMPTED POSITIVISM NOT TO FIND OUT THE NEW NOT TO ADD TO WHAT IS CALLED KNOWLEDGE BUT TO SYSTEMATIZE
LUMPS OF JELLY WERE FOUND ON THE GROUND AT RAHWAY NEW JERSEY THE SUBSTANCE WAS WHITISH OR RESEMBLED THE COAGULATED WHITE OF AN EGG THAT MISTER H H GARLAND OF NELSON COUNTY VIRGINIA HAD FOUND A JELLY LIKE SUBSTANCE
NEVERTHELESS THEY WERE AS COMMON AS WERE GREEN SUNS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE SCIENCE HAD TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE UNCONVENTIONALITIES SUCH PUBLICATIONS AS NATURE AND KNOWLEDGE WERE BESIEGED WITH INQUIRIES
THE ARRIVAL OF DUST FROM SOMEWHERE BEYOND THIS EARTH NOT THAT SCIENTISTS THEMSELVES HAVE EVER ACHIEVED POSITIVENESS IN ITS ASPECT OF UNITEDNESS AMONG THEMSELVES BECAUSE NORDENSKIOLD
A BUFF COLORED PULPY SUBSTANCE WAS FOUND
SOMETHING OCCURRED IN BATH COUNTY KENTUCKY THAT BROUGHT MANY NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS TO THE SCENE THE SUBSTANCE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEEF THAT FELL FROM THE SKY
IS PROFESSOR GRAVES ACCOUNT COMMUNICATED BY PROFESSOR DEWEY THAT UPON THE EVENING OF AUGUST THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN A LIGHT WAS SEEN IN AMHERST A FALLING OBJECT SOUND
IT SEEMS MORE ACCEPTABLE THAT ONLY CERTAIN AREAS ARE
THE NEXT DAY A JELLY LIKE MASS WAS FOUND IN THE SNOW
THE EXCLUSIONISTS EXPLANATION AT THAT TIME WAS THAT STONES DO NOT FALL FROM THE SKY
FALLS OF VISCID SUBSTANCE IN THE YEARS SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO SIXTEEN EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN SEVENTEEN NINETY SIX EIGHTEEN ELEVEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR
BUT THE COMMON IMPRESSION OF THEM IS ONLY A RETREAT OF ATTEMPTED EXCLUSION THAT ONLY TWO KINDS OF SUBSTANCE FALL FROM THE SKY METALLIC AND STONY
PLACED BEFORE THE ACADEMY SOME FRAGMENTS OF A GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE SAID TO HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY AND ASKED THAT THEY BE ANALYZED THERE IS NO FURTHER ALLUSION TO THIS SUBJECT COMPTES RENDUS
TO GIVE COMPLETENESS TO THE PROPER EXPLANATION IT IS SAID THAT MISTER BRANDEIS HAD IDENTIFIED THE SUBSTANCE AS FLESH COLORED NOSTOC PROFESSOR LAWRENCE SMITH OF KENTUCKY
THE NEXT MORNING IN PROFESSOR DEWEY'S FRONT YARD IN WHAT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN THE ONLY POSITION FROM WHICH THE LIGHT THAT HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE ROOM THE NIGHT BEFORE COULD HAVE BEEN REFLECTED
SO HOW CAN YOU PROVE THAT SOMETHING IS NOT SOMETHING ELSE WHEN NEITHER IS SOMETHING ELSE SOME OTHER THING THERE'S NOTHING TO PROVE THIS IS ONE OF THE PROFUNDITIES THAT WE ADVERTISED IN ADVANCE
AS MUCH AS IT CAN EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THIS EARTH THIS BOOK IS AN ASSEMBLAGE OF DATA OF EXTERNAL RELATIONS OF THIS EARTH WE TAKE THE POSITION THAT OUR DATA HAVE BEEN DAMNED UPON NO CONSIDERATION FOR INDIVIDUAL MERITS OR DEMERITS
IT WOULD SEEM ACCEPTABLE THAT IF MANY REPORTS OF WHITE BIRDS SHOULD OCCUR THE BIRDS ARE NOT BLACKBIRDS EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN WHITE BLACKBIRDS OR THAT IF OFTEN REPORTED
THAT THE FALL DID TAKE PLACE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE EXCLUSIONISTS ARE STILL MORE EMPHATICALLY CONSERVATORS IT IS NOT SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE INIMICAL TO ALL DATA
UPON MARCH THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX AT OLYMPIAN SPRINGS BATH COUNTY KENTUCKY FLAKES OF A SUBSTANCE THAT LOOKED LIKE BEEF FELL FROM THE SKY FROM A CLEAR SKY WE'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT WAS SAID
ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO IF ANYONE WAS SO CREDULOUS AS TO THINK THAT STONES HAD EVER FALLEN FROM THE SKY HE WAS REASONED WITH IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE ARE NO STONES IN THE SKY THEREFORE NO STONES CAN FALL FROM THE SKY
RAW MEAT SHOULD NOT BE FED TO BABIES WE SHALL HAVE A FEW DATA INITIATORILY I FEAR ME THAT THE HORSE AND THE BARN WERE A LITTLE EXTREME FOR OUR BUDDING LIBERALITIES THE OUTRAGEOUS IS THE REASONABLE
OF ABOUT THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF A TWENTY FIVE CENT PIECE THAT ACCORDING TO A COMMUNICATION FROM A C TWINING TO PROFESSOR OLMSTEAD A WOMAN AT WEST POINT NEW YORK
SMALL FROGS FELL AT WIGAN ENGLAND NATURE EIGHTY SEVEN TEN THAT JUNE TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN ELEVEN AT ETON BUCKS ENGLAND THE GROUND WAS FOUND COVERED WITH MASSES OF JELLY THE SIZE OF PEAS
ALMOST ALWAYS THE EXCLUSIONISTS ARGUE
OR NOTHING MORE REASONABLE OR SCIENTIFIC OR LOGICAL THAN THAT COULD BE SAID UPON ANY SUBJECT THE ONLY TROUBLE IS THE UNIVERSAL TROUBLE THAT THE MAJOR PREMISE IS NOT REAL OR IS INTERMEDIATE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN REALNESS
MY OWN CHIEF REASON FOR INDIGNATION HERE THAT THIS PREPOSTEROUS EXPLANATION INTERFERES WITH SOME OF MY OWN ENORMITIES IT WOULD COST ME TOO MUCH EXPLAINING IF I SHOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THIS EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE
AT NIGHT OCTOBER EIGHTH EIGHTEEN FORTY FOUR NEAR COBLENZ A GERMAN WHO WAS KNOWN TO GREG AND ANOTHER PERSON SAW A LUMINOUS BODY FALL CLOSE TO THEM THEY RETURNED NEXT MORNING AND FOUND A GELATINOUS MASS
THAT FAR INTO OUR OWN TIMES SOME SCIENTISTS NOTABLY PROFESSOR LAWRENCE SMITH AND SIR ROBERT BALL CONTINUED TO HOLD OUT AGAINST ALL EXTERNAL ORIGINS ASSERTING THAT NOTHING COULD FALL TO THIS EARTH
THAT THEY HAD SCATTERED THE DECAYING FLESH OF A DEAD HOG OVER THE TOBACCO FIELDS IF WE DON'T ACCEPT THIS DATUM
WRITES OF THE SUBSTANCE THAT HAD SO COMPLETELY OR BEAUTIFULLY IF BEAUTY IS COMPLETENESS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NOSTOC IT TURNED OUT TO BE LUNG TISSUE ALSO
STORY OF A HIGHLY UNPLEASANT SUBSTANCE THAT HAD FALLEN FROM THE SKY IN WILSON COUNTY TENNESSEE WE READ THAT DOCTOR TROOST VISITED THE PLACE AND INVESTIGATED LATER WE'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE SOME INVESTIGATIONS
SO TO KNOW WAS CONVENIENT WHEN WE COME TO REPORTED FALLS OF GELATINOUS SUBSTANCES I'D LIKE IT TO BE NOTICED HOW OFTEN THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS WHITISH OR GRAYISH IN LOOKING UP THE SUBJECT MYSELF I HAVE READ ONLY
HE IS VERY SURE BUT JUST A LITTLE REDUNDANT WE SHALL BE OPPOSED BY THE STANDARD RESISTANCES THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE UP FROM ONE PLACE IN A WHIRLWIND AND DOWN IN ANOTHER
SEEMS TO PARTAKE SO MUCH OF THE MARVELOUS AS ALMOST ENTIRELY TO EXCLUDE THE OPERATION OF KNOWN AND NATURAL AGENTS YET A BODY OF EVIDENCE IS HERE BROUGHT TO PROVE THAT SUCH EVENTS HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE
I FEAR ME I FEAR ME THIS IS ONE OF THE PROFOUNDLY DAMNED I BLURT OUT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD PERHAPS BE WITHHELD FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES BUT THAT DAMNED THING WAS THE SIZE OF AN ELEPHANT
FOR EITHER SPAWN OR NOSTOC GREG'S COMMENT IN THIS INSTANCE IS CURIOUS IF TRUE BUT HE RECORDS WITHOUT MODIFICATION THE FALL OF A METEORITE AT GOTHA GERMANY SEPTEMBER SIXTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE
DOCTOR A MEAD EDWARDS PRESIDENT OF THE NEWARK SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION
WHETHER THE SUBSTANCE WERE NOSTOC OR SPAWN OR SOME KIND OF A LARVAL NEXUS DOESN'T MATTER SO MUCH IF IT STOOD IN THE SKY FOR SEVERAL DAYS WE RANK WITH MOSES AS A CHRONICLER OF IMPROPRIETIES
WAS FOUND A SUBSTANCE UNLIKE ANYTHING BEFORE OBSERVED BY ANYONE WHO SAW IT IT WAS A BOWL SHAPED OBJECT ABOUT EIGHT INCHES IN DIAMETER AND ONE INCH THICK BRIGHT BUFF COLORED AND HAVING UPON IT A
FOR INSTANCE THE TURTLE OF VICKSBURG
DISTRIBUTION OF THE DUST OF KRAKATOA VELOCITY OF TRANSLATION
NEVER BOTHER TO FIGHT A THING SET ITS OWN PARTS FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER WE ARE MERGING AWAY FROM CARNAL TO GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE AND HERE THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF INSTANCES OR REPORTS OF INSTANCES
AN ALGA OR IN SOME RESPECTS A FUNGOUS GROWTH THE RIVAL CONVENTION IS SPAWN OF FROGS OR OF FISHES THESE TWO CONVENTIONS HAVE MADE A STRONG COMBINATION
UPON REMOVING THIS COVERING A BUFF COLORED PULPY SUBSTANCE OF THE CONSISTENCY OF SOFT SOAP WAS FOUND OF AN OFFENSIVE SUFFOCATING SMELL
AND UNREALNESS IN SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO A COMMITTEE OF WHOM LAVOISIER WAS A MEMBER WAS APPOINTED BY THE FRENCH ACADEMY TO INVESTIGATE A REPORT THAT A STONE HAD FALLEN FROM THE SKY AT LUCE FRANCE
AS IF THIS TIME FROG SPAWN DID FALL FROM THE SKY AND MAY HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED BY A WHIRLWIND BECAUSE
LAVOISIER'S ANALYSIS ABSOLUTELY PROVED
THE PHENOMENON WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE REMARKS BEFORE US WILL SEEM TO MOST PERSONS AS LITTLE WORTHY OF CREDIT AS ANY THAT COULD BE OFFERED THE FALLING OF LARGE STONES FROM THE SKY WITHOUT ANY ASSIGNABLE CAUSE OF THEIR PREVIOUS ASCENT
A FEW MINUTES OF EXPOSURE TO THE AIR CHANGED THE BUFF COLOR TO A LIVID COLOR RESEMBLING VENOUS BLOOD IT ABSORBED MOISTURE QUICKLY FROM THE AIR AND LIQUEFIED FOR SOME OF THE CHEMIC REACTIONS SEE THE JOURNAL
THE FALL OF A THOUSAND TONS OF BUTTER JET BLACK SNOW PINK SNOW BLUE HAILSTONES HAILSTONES FLAVORED LIKE ORANGES PUNK AND SILK AND CHARCOAL
AND THAT HOT STONES MAY BE PICKED UP WHERE A LUMINOUS OBJECT SEEMINGLY HAD LANDED ONLY LIGHTNING STRIKING A STONE HEATING EVEN MELTING IT THE STONE OF LUCE SHOWED SIGNS OF FUSION
RECOGNIZED IT IN A MOMENT IT WAS A GELATINOUS FUNGUS HE DID NOT SATISFY HIMSELF AS TO JUST THE EXACT SPECIES IT BELONGED TO BUT HE PREDICTED THAT SIMILAR FUNGI MIGHT SPRING UP WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS
HAD BEEN FOUND AT NEARLY THE SAME PLACE PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK WAS INVITED BY PROFESSOR GRAVES TO EXAMINE IT EXACTLY LIKE THE FIRST ONE CORRESPONDED IN SIZE AND COLOR AND CONSISTENCY THE CHEMIC REACTIONS WERE THE SAME PROFESSOR HITCHCOCK
THAT SEEMED TO PASS NEAR THE GROUND
THAT SEEMS TO ME TO BELONG HERE LONDON TIMES APRIL NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX FALL OF FISH THAT HAD OCCURRED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THE WRITER ABANDONS THE FIRST OR ABSOLUTE EXCLUSION AND MODIFIES IT WITH THE EXPLANATION THAT THE DAY BEFORE A REPORTED FALL OF STONES IN TUSCANY JUNE SIXTEENTH SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR THERE HAD BEEN AN ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS
AND THE NEW YORK TIMES MARCH TENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX THEN THE EXCLUSIONISTS SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE BEEF ONE FLAKE OF IT THE SIZE OF A SQUARE ENVELOPE
ANNUAL REGISTER
NEVERTHELESS HE ENDORSES THE LOCAL EXPLANATION AND A BIZARRE THING IT IS A FLOCK OF GORGED HEAVY WEIGHTED BUZZARDS BUT FAR UP AND INVISIBLE IN THE CLEAR SKY
AND NOW WE HAVE AN OCCURRENCE THAT ATTRACTED A GREAT DEAL OF ATTENTION IN ITS OWN TIME USUALLY THESE THINGS OF THE ACCURSED HAVE BEEN HUSHED UP OR DISREGARDED SUPPRESSED LIKE THE SEVEN BLACK RAINS OF SLAINS BUT UPON MARCH THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SIX
WAS NOT SO PRUDISH CHLADNI WAS NOT AND GREG WAS NOT I SHALL HAVE TO ACCEPT MYSELF THAT GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE HAS OFTEN FALLEN FROM THE SKY OR THAT
EXPRESSED IN THE SUPPLEMENT IS AMUSING TO SOME OF US WHO I FEAR MAY BE A LITTLE IMPROPER AT TIMES VERY SPIRIT OF THE SALVATION ARMY WHEN SOME THIRD RATE SCIENTIST COMES OUT WITH AN EXPLANATION OF THE VERMIFORM APPENDIX
AND FORTY PLATES SOME OF THEM MARVELOUSLY COLORED IT WAS ISSUED AFTER AN INVESTIGATION THAT TOOK FIVE YEARS YOU COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING DONE MORE EFFICIENTLY ARTISTICALLY AUTHORITATIVELY THE MATHEMATICAL PARTS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPRESSIVE
SCIENTISTS HAVE PERPETRATED SUCH AN ENORMITY AS SUSPENSION OF VOLCANIC DUST SEVEN YEARS IN THE AIR DISREGARDING THE LAPSE OF SEVERAL YEARS
THEY HAD DISGORGED PROFESSOR FASSIG LISTS THE SUBSTANCE IN HIS BIBLIOGRAPHY AS FISH SPAWN MC ATEE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
OF OUTSIDE FORCES ONE MAY HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF A LAVOISIER AND STILL NOT BE ABLE TO ANALYZE NOT BE ABLE EVEN TO SEE
EARLY IN AUGUST EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR THOUSANDS OF JELLYFISH ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHILLING HAD FALLEN AT BATH ENGLAND I THINK IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT THEY WERE JELLYFISH BUT IT DOES LOOK
EXCEPT CONFORMABLY WITH THE HYPNOSES OR THE CONVENTIONAL REACTIONS AGAINST HYPNOSES OF ONE'S ERA WE BELIEVE NO MORE WE ACCEPT
THE FLAKE FORMATION IS INTERESTING LATER WE SHALL THINK OF IT AS SIGNIFYING PRESSURE SOMEWHERE IT WAS A THICK SHOWER ON THE GROUND ON TREES ON FENCES BUT IT WAS NARROWLY LOCALIZED
AFTER A HEAVY RAINFALL WE ARE NOT TOLD OF NOSTOC THIS TIME IT IS SAID THAT THE OBJECT CONTAINED NUMEROUS EGGS
MISTER JENYNS CONCEIVES OF A LARGE POOL IN WHICH WERE MANY OF THESE SPHERICAL MASSES OF THE POOL DRYING UP AND CONCENTRATING ALL IN A SMALL AREA OF A WHIRLWIND THEN SCOOPING ALL UP TOGETHER
THEN IT SPREAD A VERY PRONOUNCED SWEETISH ODOR IT IS DESCRIBED AS LIKE GELATINE BUT MUCH FIRMER BUT HAVING BEEN IN WATER TWENTY FOUR HOURS IT SWELLED OUT
HAD SEEN A MASS THE SIZE OF A TEACUP IT LOOKED LIKE BOILED STARCH THAT ACCORDING TO A NEWSPAPER OF NEWARK NEW JERSEY A MASS OF GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE LIKE SOFT SOAP HAD BEEN FOUND
TO SEE THE SUBSTANCE THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NOSTOC BUT HE HAD ALSO CALLED UPON DOCTOR HAMILTON WHO HAD A SPECIMEN AND DOCTOR HAMILTON HAD DECLARED IT TO BE LUNG TISSUE DOCTOR EDWARDS
I SUPPOSE IN ALASKA AND IN THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDS ALL THE MEDICINE MEN WERE SIMILARLY UPON TRIAL SOMETHING HAD TO BE THOUGHT OF UPON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THE VOLCANO OF KRAKATOA OF THE STRAITS OF SUNDA
IT'S MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY YEARS LATER
VISCOUS AND PUTRID
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SO DEFINITELY IDENTIFIED AS OF A KNOWN LOCAL SPECIES OR THEY WERE NOT FISH AT ALL I INCLINE MYSELF TO THE ACCEPTANCE THAT THEY WERE NOT FISH
LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHIRLWIND AND VOLCANO EXPLANATIONS HAD TO BE ABANDONED BUT SO POWERFUL WAS THIS EXCLUSION HYPNOSIS SENTENCE OF DAMNATION OR THIS ATTEMPT AT POSITIVENESS
TO ACCEPT CONNECTION OR THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST VAST GELATINOUS AREAS ALOFT AND THAT METEORITES TEAR THROUGH CARRYING DOWN SOME OF THE SUBSTANCE
IN THE TOPOGRAPHY OF INTELLECTION I SHOULD SAY THAT WHAT WE CALL KNOWLEDGE IS IGNORANCE SURROUNDED BY LAUGHTER BLACK RAINS RED RAINS
THAT'S THE EXPLANATION THAT THE SCIENTISTS GAVE
LEAVING A JELLY LIKE MASS ON THE GROUND WE ARE TOLD THAT THIS SUBSTANCE FELL ONLY THREE FEET AWAY FROM AN OBSERVER IN THE REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE NINETY FOUR ACCORDING TO A LETTER FROM GREG TO PROFESSOR BADEN POWELL
AS LATE AS NOVEMBER NINETEEN O TWO
GREEN SCIENCE GOSSIP
IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE COMMON SENSE TO SAY THAT THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STATIONARY OVER THE TOWN OF BATH SEVERAL DAYS THE SEVEN BLACK RAINS OF SLAINS THE FOUR RED RAINS OF SIENA
WITH WHICH WE SHALL END UP IT WILL MEAN THAT SOMETHING HAD BEEN IN A STATIONARY POSITION FOR SEVERAL DAYS OVER A SMALL PART OF A SMALL TOWN IN ENGLAND THIS IS THE REVOLUTIONARY THING THAT WE HAVE ALLUDED TO BEFORE
FAR UP OR FAR AWAY THE WHOLE SKY IS GELATINOUS THAT METEORS TEAR THROUGH AND DETACH FRAGMENTS THAT FRAGMENTS ARE BROUGHT DOWN BY STORMS
OF BATH HIS DESCRIPTION IS OF MINUTE WORMS IN FILMY ENVELOPES HE TRIES TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR SEGREGATION THE MYSTERY OF IT IS WHAT COULD HAVE BROUGHT SO MANY OF THEM TOGETHER
EXCEPT THAT IN THE SEVEN THERE WAS A LAPSE OF SEVERAL YEARS AND WHERE WAS THE VOLCANIC DUST ALL THAT TIME
THAT NOTHING BUT THIS FALLING SUBSTANCE WAS VISIBLE IN THE SKY IT FELL IN FLAKES OF VARIOUS SIZES SOME TWO INCHES SQUARE
NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS WROTE BROADCAST AND WITNESSES WERE QUOTED AND THIS TIME THERE IS NO MENTION OF A HOAX AND EXCEPT BY ONE SCIENTIST
SAYS THAT ALL OUR DATA IN THIS RESPECT MUST BE
AND IN MOST OF THEM SEGREGATION IS THE GREAT MYSTERY A WHIRLWIND SEEMS ANYTHING BUT A SEGREGATIVE FORCE SEGREGATION OF THINGS THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY HAS BEEN AVOIDED AS MOST DEEP DYED OF THE DAMNED
IT IS SAID THAT THE FISH WERE OF THE CHALWA SPECIES ABOUT A SPAN IN LENGTH AND A SEER IN WEIGHT YOU KNOW THEY WERE DEAD AND DRY OR
IN A WHIRLWIND NOW I CAN'T SAY THAT NOSTOC IS ALWAYS GREENISH ANY MORE THAN I CAN SAY THAT BLACKBIRDS ARE ALWAYS BLACK HAVING SEEN A WHITE ONE WE SHALL QUOTE A SCIENTIST WHO KNEW OF FLESH COLORED NOSTOC WHEN
A MEMBER OF THE SELBORNE SOCIETY STILL ARGUED THAT METEORITES DO NOT FALL FROM THE SKY THAT THEY ARE MASSES OF IRON UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT ATTRACT LIGHTNING
IF INTRODUCED POLITELY HAILSTONES FOR INSTANCE ONE READS IN THE NEWSPAPERS OF HAILSTONES THE SIZE OF HENS EGGS ONE SMILES NEVERTHELESS I WILL ENGAGE TO LIST ONE HUNDRED INSTANCES FROM THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
OR DATA OF THEM BOMBARDED THE WALLS RAISED AGAINST THEM MONTHLY REVIEW
THAT IN WILNA LITHUANIA APRIL FOURTH EIGHTEEN FORTY SIX IN A RAINSTORM FELL NUT SIZED MASSES OF A SUBSTANCE THAT IS DESCRIBED AS BOTH RESINOUS AND GELATINOUS IT WAS ODORLESS UNTIL BURNED
IT IS SAID THAT WHATEVER THEY WERE THEY COULD NOT BE EATEN THAT IN THE PAN
HAD BLOWN UP TERRIFIC WE'RE TOLD THAT THE SOUND WAS HEARD TWO THOUSAND MILES AND THAT THIRTY SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY PERSONS WERE KILLED SEEMS JUST A LITTLE UNSCIENTIFIC OR IMPOSITIVE TO ME
OCCURS THE INEVITABLE DAMNATION OF THE AMHERST OBJECT PROFESSOR EDWARD HITCHCOCK WENT TO LIVE IN AMHERST
THESE DATA ARE SO IMPROPER THEY'RE OBSCENE TO THE SCIENCE OF TODAY BUT WE SHALL SEE THAT SCIENCE
MAY SIXTEENTH OR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR IS THE DATE GIVEN IN THE JOURNAL
THEN BEGAN THORHALL AND SAID HAS IT NOT BEEN THAT THE REDBEARD HAS PROVED A BETTER FRIEND THAN YOUR CHRIST THIS WAS MY GIFT FOR THE POETRY WHICH I COMPOSED ABOUT THOR MY PATRON SELDOM HAS HE FAILED ME
SOME OF THE FAMOUS PEASE PORRIDGE THAT WAS MADE THERE AND FINALLY AFTER A LONG AND TIRESOME JOURNEY HE REACHED THE TOWN AND STOPPED AT ONE OF THE FIRST HOUSES HE CAME TO
WELL THE MAN IN THE I MEAN THE MAN
SO THE BALLOON WAS BROUGHT AND INFLATED AND THE MAN GOT INTO THE BASKET AND GAVE THE WORD TO LET GO AND THEN THE BALLOON MOUNTED UP INTO THE SKY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MOON THE GOOD PEOPLE OF NORWICH STOOD ON THE EARTH
THERE WERE SO MANY BIRDS ON IT THAT SCARCELY WAS IT POSSIBLE TO PUT ONE'S FEET DOWN FOR THE EGGS THEY CONTINUED THEIR COURSE UP THE FIRTH WHICH THEY CALLED STRAUMSFJORDR AND CARRIED THEIR CARGO ASHORE FROM THE SHIPS AND THERE THEY PREPARED TO STAY
SOUTHERN SLOPES FROM PEAK TO PEAK LIKE WHITE PEARLY FOG IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT SHADOWS IN GREAT PART DETERMINE NOT ONLY THE FORMS OF LOFTY ICE MOUNTAINS
CAME FULL IN SIGHT UNNUMBERED MOUNTAINS RISING SHARPLY INTO THE CLOUDLESS SKY THEIR BASES SOLID WHITE THEIR SIDES PLASHED WITH SNOW LIKE OCEAN ROCKS WITH FOAM
WE HAVE IN OUR SHIPS MALT MEAL AND CORN AND YOU HAVE RIGHT AND TITLE TO TAKE THEREFROM WHATEVER YOU WISH AND TO MAKE YOUR ENTERTAINMENT SUCH AS CONSORTS WITH YOUR MUNIFICENCE AND EIRIK ACCEPTED THE OFFER
I SAW ONLY ONE BANNER STORM THAT SEEMED IN EVERY WAY PERFECT THIS WAS IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE WHEN THE SNOW LADEN PEAKS WERE SWEPT BY A POWERFUL NORTHER
ON THE HIGHEST PEAKS ARE STREAMING PERFECTLY FREE FROM PEAK TO PEAK ACROSS INTERVENING NOTCHES OR PASSES WHILE OTHERS OVERLAP AND PARTLY HIDE ONE ANOTHER AS TO THEIR FORMATION
AS IF IT WERE MADE OF SILK SO RARE AND SPLENDID A PICTURE OF COURSE SMOTHERED EVERYTHING ELSE AND I AT ONCE BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE AND WALLOW UP THE SNOW CHOKED INDIAN CANYON
FIND THIS SNOW DUST IN A LOOSE CONDITION ON THE SLOPES ABOVE THE TIMBER LINE
SO AS IT WAS NOW NIGHT HE FETCHED HIS TELESCOPE AND LOOKED AT THE MOON AND FOUND THERE WAS NO MAN IN IT AT ALL IT SEEMS TO BE TRUE SAID THE ASTRONOMER THAT THE MAN HAS GOT OUT OF THE MOON SOMEHOW OR OTHER
THEY REMAINED THERE DURING THE WINTER WHICH HAPPENED TO BE A HARD ONE WITH NO WORK DOING AND THEY WERE BADLY OFF FOR FOOD AND THE FISHING FAILED THEN THEY WENT OUT TO THE ISLAND HOPING THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE GOT THERE FROM FISHING OR FROM WHAT WAS DRIFTED ASHORE
DURING THIS TIME MUCH TALK TOOK PLACE IN BRATTAHLID ABOUT MAKING READY TO GO TO VINLAND THE GOOD AND IT WAS ASSERTED
TO THE SEA BUT THOUGH SNOW DUST AND STORM WINDS ABOUND ON THE MOUNTAINS REGULAR SHAPELY BANNERS ARE FOR CAUSES WE SHALL PRESENTLY SEE SELDOM PRODUCED
NOR WAS I IN THE LEAST DISAPPOINTED I REACHED THE TOP OF THE RIDGE IN FOUR OR FIVE HOURS AND THROUGH AN OPENING IN THE WOODS THE MOST IMPOSING WIND STORM EFFECT I EVER BEHELD
THEN WAS PREPARATION MADE FOR THE YULE FEAST AND SO MAGNIFICENT WAS IT THAT THE MEN THOUGHT THEY HAD SCARCELY EVER SEEN SO GRAND A FEAST AND AFTER YULE KARLSEFNI BROACHED TO EIRIK THE SUBJECT OF A MARRIAGE WITH GUDRID
AND SWEEP IT ONWARD FROM PEAK TO PEAK IN THE FORM OF SMOOTH REGULAR BANNERS OR IN CLOUDY DRIFTS ACCORDING TO THE VELOCITY AND DIRECTION OF THE WIND AND THE CONFORMATION OF THE SLOPES OVER WHICH IT IS DRIVEN
THEY HAD WITH THEM CATTLE OF ALL KINDS AND FOR THEMSELVES THEY SOUGHT OUT THE PRODUCE OF THE LAND THEREABOUT THERE WERE MOUNTAINS AND THE PLACE WAS FAIR TO LOOK UPON THEY GAVE NO HEED TO ANYTHING EXCEPT TO EXPLORE THE LAND AND THEY FOUND LARGE PASTURES
THE MAN IN THE MOON
FOR BY THIS TIME HE WAS VERY HUNGRY INDEED A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN ANSWERED HIS KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND HE ASKED POLITELY IS THIS THE TOWN OF NORWICH MADAM
NOW WHEN THE MEN KNEW THAT NONE OF THEM WOULD EAT OF IT AND THEY THREW IT DOWN FROM THE ROCKS AND TURNED WITH THEIR SUPPLICATIONS TO GOD'S MERCY THEN WAS GRANTED TO THEM OPPORTUNITY OF FISHING AND AFTER THAT THERE WAS NO LACK OF FOOD THAT SPRING
HOW DID YOU GET HERE I SLID DOWN A MOONBEAM INDEED WELL WHAT WERE YOU RUNNING FOR A WOMAN GAVE ME SOME COLD PEASE PORRIDGE AND IT BURNED MY MOUTH
WITH BOTH EYES AND MOUTH AND NOSTRILS WIDE OPEN CLAWING AND PINCHING HIMSELF AND RECITING SOMETHING THEY ASKED WHY HE HAD COME THERE HE REPLIED THAT IT WAS OF NO IMPORTANCE BEGGED THEM NOT TO WONDER THEREAT
THERE WAS A MAN NAMED THORFINN KARLSEFNI SON OF THORD HORSEHEAD WHO DWELT IN THE NORTH OF ICELAND AT REYNINES IN SKAGAFJORDR AS IT IS NOW CALLED
WHICH BELONGS TO THE CIRCUS THAT CAME HERE LAST SUMMER AND WAS PAWNED FOR A BOARD BILL WE CAN INFLATE THIS BALLOON AND SEND THE MAN OUT OF THE MOON HOME IN IT
THE TWO SHIPS LAUNCHED OUT INTO THE OPEN SEA AS SOON AS THEY WERE READY IT IS NOT RECORDED
OR IN STRATIFIED SHEETS IN THE GLACIER CIRQUES SOME OF IT TO REPLENISH THE SMALL RESIDUAL GLACIERS AND REMAIN SILENT AND RIGID FOR CENTURIES BEFORE IT IS FINALLY MELTED AND SENT SINGING DOWN HOME
AND THERE WERE THIRTY MEN IN THE COMPANY THERE WAS A MAN NAMED BJARNI GRIMOLF'S SON
FASTER AND FASTER SO THAT JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE EARTH HE LOST HIS HOLD AND CAME TUMBLING DOWN HEAD OVER HEELS AND FELL PLUMP INTO A RIVER THE COOL WATER
OR FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET IN BREADTH AND AS SHAPELY AND AS SUBSTANTIAL LOOKING IN TEXTURE AS THE BANNERS OF THE FINEST SILK ALL STREAMING AND WAVING FREE AND CLEAR IN THE SUN GLOW
YOU RE IN NORWICH THAT IS TRUE ANSWERED THE MAN WHO WAS QUITE BEWILDERED BY THIS IDEA AND OF COURSE YOU MUST BE CALLED SOMETHING CONTINUED THE MAGISTRATE WELL THEN SAID THE PRISONER
AND CUT IT UP AND STILL THEY KNEW NOT WHAT KIND OF WHALE IT WAS EVEN KARLSEFNI RECOGNISED IT NOT THOUGH HE HAD GREAT KNOWLEDGE OF WHALES IT WAS COOKED BY THE COOK BOYS AND THEY ATE THEREOF THOUGH BAD EFFECTS CAME UPON ALL FROM IT AFTERWARDS
THE NIGHTS ARE TOO HOT WHY
IF I M NOT THE MAN IN THE MOON I MUST BE THE MAN OUT OF THE MOON SO CALL ME THAT VERY GOOD REPLIED THE JUDGE NOW THEN WHERE DID YOU COME FROM THE MOON OH YOU DID EH
THEY ARE TWENTY MILES AWAY BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH THEM NEARER FOR EVERY FEATURE IS DISTINCT AND THE WHOLE WONDERFUL SHOW IS SEEN IN ITS RIGHT PROPORTIONS LIKE A PAINTING ON THE SKY
WHAT HAVE YOU NEVER HEARD THE STORY OF THE MAN IN THE MOON THEN I MUST SURELY TELL IT FOR IT IS VERY AMUSING AND THERE IS NOT A WORD OF TRUTH IN IT
AS IF CELEBRATING SOME SURPASSINGLY GLORIOUS EVENT THE SNOW OF WHICH THESE BANNERS ARE MADE FALLS ON THE HIGH SIERRA IN MOST EXTRAVAGANT ABUNDANCE SOMETIMES TO A DEPTH OF FIFTEEN OR TWENTY FEET
SCREAMED THE MAN WHY YOUR PORRIDGE IS SO HOT IT HAS BURNED ME FIDDLESTICKS SHE REPLIED THE PORRIDGE IS QUITE COLD TRY IT YOURSELF HE CRIED SO SHE TRIED IT
WHAT S A GOOD PLACE TO VISIT DOWN THERE ENQUIRED THE MAN IN THE MOON OH NORWICH IS A MIGHTY FINE PLACE RETURNED THE ALDERMAN
IT MUST BE VASTLY MORE PLEASANT TO HAVE COMPANIONS TO TALK TO THAN TO BE SHUT UP IN A BIG PLANET ALL BY HIMSELF WHERE HE HAD TO WHISTLE TO KEEP HIMSELF COMPANY ONE DAY
THERE WAS A CAPE TO WHICH THEY CAME THEY CRUISED ALONG THE LAND LEAVING IT ON THE STARBOARD SIDE THERE WAS A HARBOURLESS COAST LAND AND LONG SANDY STRANDS THEY WENT TO THE LAND IN BOATS AND FOUND THE KEEL OF A SHIP
HE WAS BUT LITTLE ENCOMPASSED WITH THE LOVE OF FRIENDS BUT YET EIRIK HAD LONG HELD CONVERSATION WITH HIM HE WENT IN THE SHIP WITH THORVALD AND HIS MAN BECAUSE HE WAS WIDELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE UNPEOPLED DISTRICTS THEY HAD THE SHIP WHICH THORBJORN HAD BROUGHT TO GREENLAND
COME COME NO NONSENSE SAID THE MAGISTRATE YOU MUST HAVE SOME NAME WHO ARE YOU WHY I M THE MAN IN THE MOON THAT S RUBBISH SAID THE MAGISTRATE EYEING THE PRISONER SEVERELY YOU MAY BE A MAN
THEY WERE DRESSED IN SUCH WISE THAT THEY HAD ON THE GARMENT WHICH THEY CALLED BIAFAL IT WAS MADE WITH A HOOD AT THE TOP OPEN AT THE SIDES WITHOUT SLEEVES AND WAS FASTENED BETWEEN THE LEGS A BUTTON AND A LOOP HELD IT TOGETHER THERE
KARLSEFNI PREPARED HIS SHIP INTENDING TO GO TO GREENLAND SNORRI THORBRAND'S SON FROM ALPTAFJORDR
OVERBEARING IN TEMPER OF MELANCHOLY MOOD SILENT AT ALL TIMES UNDERHAND IN HIS DEALINGS AND WITHAL GIVEN TO ABUSE AND ALWAYS INCLINED TOWARDS THE WORST HE HAD KEPT HIMSELF ALOOF FROM THE TRUE FAITH WHEN IT CAME TO GREENLAND
EIRIK AND LEIF HAD GOT THESE PEOPLE TO GO WITH KARLSEFNI NOW WHEN THEY HAD SAILED BY FURDUSTRANDIR THEY PUT THE SCOTCH PEOPLE ON LAND AND REQUESTED THEM TO RUN INTO THE SOUTHERN REGIONS SEEK FOR CHOICE LAND
WHILE THUS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR A SMALL PORTION ESCAPES FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SKY AS VAPOR BUT FAR THE GREATER PART IS AT LENGTH LOCKED FAST IN BOSSY OVERCURLING CORNICES ALONG THE RIDGES
AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO DO NEXT I D LIKE TO GET BACK TO THE MOON SAID THE MAN
THE MAN IN THE MOON WAS RATHER LONESOME AND OFTEN HE PEEKED OVER THE EDGE OF THE MOON AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE EARTH AND ENVIED ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED TOGETHER FOR HE THOUGHT
IS PREPARED FOR THE GRAND BANNER WAVING CELEBRATIONS BY THE ACTION OF THE WIND INSTEAD OF AT ONCE FINDING REST LIKE THAT WHICH FALLS INTO THE TRANQUIL DEPTHS OF THE FOREST IT IS SHOVED
WITH NOTHING TO BLUR THE SUBLIME PICTURE THEY MADE FANCY YOURSELF STANDING BESIDE ME ON THIS YOSEMITE RIDGE THERE IS A STRANGE GARISH GLITTER IN THE AIR AND THE GALE DRIVES WILDLY OVERHEAD
THE PEAKS ALONG THE AXIS OF THE RANGE ARE THEN DECORATED WITH RESPLENDENT BANNERS SOME OF THEM MORE THAN A MILE LONG SHINING STREAMING WAVING WITH SOLEMN EXUBERANT ENTHUSIASM
THORHALL DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT AND THEY WENT TO SEEK HIM AND SOUGHT FOR THREE HALF DAYS CONTINUOUSLY ON THE FOURTH HALF DAY KARLSEFNI AND BJARNI FOUND HIM ON THE PEAK OF A CRAG HE LAY WITH HIS FACE TO THE SKY
HE HAD FOR A LONG TIME BEEN EIRIK'S COMPANION IN HUNTING AND FISHING EXPEDITIONS DURING THE SUMMERS AND MANY THINGS HAD BEEN COMMITTED TO HIS KEEPING THORHALL WAS A BIG MAN DARK AND OF GAUNT APPEARANCE RATHER ADVANCED IN YEARS
THE POLICEMAN ON THE FIRST CORNER SAW HIM RUNNING AND PROMPTLY ARRESTED HIM AND HE WAS MARCHED OFF TO THE MAGISTRATE FOR TRIAL WHAT IS YOUR NAME ASKED THE MAGISTRATE I HAVE N'T ANY REPLIED THE MAN
TO A RIDGE ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND FEET HIGH COMMANDING A GENERAL VIEW OF THE MAIN SUMMITS ALONG THE AXIS OF THE RANGE FEELING ASSURED I SHOULD FIND THEM BANNERED STILL MORE GLORIOUSLY
AND FOUND IT VERY COLD AND PLEASANT BUT THE MAN WAS SO ASTONISHED TO SEE HER EAT THE PORRIDGE THAT HAD BLISTERED HIS OWN MOUTH THAT HE BECAME FRIGHTENED AND RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND DOWN THE STREET AS FAST AS HE COULD GO
AND TIPPED BACK THEIR HEADS AND WATCHED THE BALLOON GO HIGHER AND HIGHER UNTIL FINALLY THE MAN REACHED OUT AND CAUGHT HOLD OF THE EDGE OF THE MOON AND BEHOLD THE NEXT MINUTE HE WAS THE MAN IN THE MOON AGAIN
AND PUT BOTH ARMS TIGHT AROUND THE MOONBEAM AND STARTED TO SLIDE DOWN BUT HE FOUND IT RATHER SLIPPERY AND IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EFFORTS TO HOLD ON HE FOUND HIMSELF GOING
AND TRANSLUCENT TOWARD THE END SO THAT THE PARTS OF THE PEAKS PAST WHICH THEY ARE STREAMING LOOK DIM AS IF SEEN THROUGH A VEIL OF GROUND GLASS AND SEE HOW SOME OF THE LONGEST OF THE BANNERS
BUT YOU FEEL NOTHING OF ITS VIOLENCE FOR YOU ARE LOOKING OUT THROUGH A SHELTERED OPENING IN THE WOODS AS THROUGH A WINDOW IN THE IMMEDIATE FOREGROUND THERE IS A FOREST OF SILVER FIR
AND PUT A FEW LUMPS OF ICE IN THE STOVE TO KEEP HIM WARM AND SAT DOWN TO THINK HOW HE SHOULD MANAGE THE TRIP YOU SEE EVERYTHING WENT BY CONTRARIES IN THE MOON AND WHEN THE MAN WISHED TO KEEP WARM
HE KNOCKED OFF A FEW CHUNKS OF ICE AND PUT THEM IN HIS STOVE AND HE COOLED HIS DRINKING WATER BY THROWING RED HOT COALS OF FIRE INTO THE PITCHER LIKEWISE WHEN HE BECAME CHILLY
THE MERCHANTS ACCEPTED THE INVITATION AND WENT HOME WITH EIRIK AFTERWARDS THEIR MERCHANDISE WAS REMOVED TO BRATTAHLID WHERE A GOOD AND LARGE OUTHOUSE WAS NOT LACKING IN WHICH TO STORE THE GOODS THE MERCHANTS WERE WELL PLEASED
THEN THEY SAILED WITH NORTHERLY WINDS TWO HALF DAYS AND THERE WAS THEN LAND BEFORE THEM AND ON IT A GREAT FOREST AND MANY WILD BEASTS AN ISLAND LAY IN THE SOUTH EAST OFF THE LAND AND THEY FOUND BEARS THEREON
INTERFERING CLOUDY DRIFTS WOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED FOR THE SNOW INSTEAD OF BEING SPOUTED STRAIGHT UP AND OVER THE TOPS OF THE PEAKS IN CONDENSED CURRENTS TO BE DRAWN OUT AS STREAMERS WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVEN OVER THE CONVEX
LET ME LOOK AT YOUR MOUTH SIR AND SEE IF IT IS REALLY BURNED THEN THE MAN OPENED HIS MOUTH AND EVERYONE SAW PLAINLY IT WAS BURNED TO A BLISTER THEREUPON THE MAGISTRATE BEGGED HIS PARDON FOR DOUBTING HIS WORD
HOW BRIGHT AND GLOWING WHITE THEY ARE AND HOW FINELY THEIR FADING FRINGES ARE PENCILED ON THE SKY SEE HOW SOLID WHITE AND OPAQUE THEY ARE AT THE POINT OF ATTACHMENT AND HOW FILMY
FROM THE MAIN WIND FLOOD OVERHEAD WERE ROARING DOWN THE SIDE CANYONS AND OVER THE CLIFFS AROUSING THE ROCKS AND THE TREES AND THE STREAMS ALIKE INTO GLORIOUS HURRAHING ENTHUSIASM
I LL TELL YOU WHAT WE CAN DO REMARKED THE ASTRONOMER
AND CALLED THE ISLAND BJARNEY BEAR ISLAND BUT THE MAINLAND WHERE THE FOREST WAS THEY CALLED MARKLAND FOREST LAND THEN WHEN TWO HALF DAYS WERE PASSED THEY SAW LAND AND SAILED UNDER IT
SURELY THIS IS THE TOWN OF NORWICH RETURNED THE WOMAN I CAME HERE TO SEE IF I COULD GET SOME PEASE PORRIDGE CONTINUED THE MAN
WITH A TEAM OF HORSES DRAWING A LOAD OF HAY AND THE HORSES LOOKED SO ODD TO THE MAN IN THE MOON THAT AT FIRST HE WAS GREATLY FRIGHTENED NEVER BEFORE HAVING SEEN HORSES EXCEPT FROM HIS HOME IN THE MOON
THE PORRIDGE THAT WAS COLD TO EARTH FOLK WAS HOT TO HIM AND THE BIG SPOONFUL OF COLD PEASE PORRIDGE HAD BURNED HIS MOUTH TO A BLISTER WHAT S THE MATTER ASKED THE WOMAN MATTER
KARLSEFNI WAS A MAN OF GOOD FAMILY AND VERY RICH HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS THORUN HE ENGAGED IN TRADING JOURNEYS AND SEEMED A GOODLY BOLD AND GALLANT TRAVELLER ONE SUMMER
THAT IT WILL SEEM TO ME AN ILL THING IF IT IS HEARD THAT YOU NEVER SPENT A WORSE YULE THAN THIS JUST NOW BEGINNING WHEN EIRIK THE RED ENTERTAINED YOU AT BRATTAHLID IN GREENLAND KARLSEFNI ANSWERED IT MUST NOT COME TO SUCH A PASS
NEARLY SCALDED HIM BEFORE HE COULD SWIM OUT BUT FORTUNATELY HE WAS NEAR THE BANK AND HE QUICKLY SCRAMBLED UPON THE LAND AND SAT DOWN TO CATCH HIS BREATH BY THAT TIME IT WAS MORNING AND AS THE SUN ROSE
BUT AFTER THIS I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT BOTH THESE SHIPS CAME TO EIRIKSFJORDR ABOUT AUTUMN EIRIK RODE DOWN TO THE SHIPS WITH OTHER MEN OF THE LAND AND A MARKET FAIR WAS PROMPTLY INSTITUTED
IN GENERAL THE NORTH SIDES ARE CONCAVE IN BOTH THEIR HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL SECTIONS HAVING BEEN SCULPTURED INTO THIS SHAPE BY THE RESIDUAL GLACIERS
BUT IT WAS N'T AT ALL QUEER TO THE MAN IN THE MOON FOR HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO IT WELL HE SAT BY HIS ICE COOL FIRE AND THOUGHT ABOUT HIS JOURNEY TO THE EARTH AND FINALLY HE DECIDED THE ONLY WAY HE COULD GET THERE
FOR A GOOD STRONG MOONBEAM AT LAST HE FOUND ONE THAT SEEMED RATHER SUBSTANTIAL AND REACHED RIGHT DOWN TO A PLEASANT LOOKING SPOT ON THE EARTH AND SO HE SWUNG HIMSELF OVER THE EDGE OF THE MOON
THE MAGISTRATE LOOKED AT HIM A MOMENT IN SURPRISE AND THEN HE SAID THIS PERSON IS EVIDENTLY CRAZY SO TAKE HIM TO THE LUNATIC ASYLUM AND KEEP HIM THERE
THANK YOU SAID THE MAN IN THE MOON BUT STOP I MUST NOT CALL HIM THE MAN IN THE MOON ANY LONGER FOR OF COURSE HE WAS NOW OUT OF THE MOON SO I LL SIMPLY CALL HIM THE MAN AND YOU LL KNOW BY THAT WHICH MAN I MEAN
WE FIND THAT THE MAIN CAUSES OF THE WONDROUS BEAUTY AND PERFECTION OF THOSE WE ARE LOOKING AT ARE THE FAVORABLE DIRECTION AND FORCE OF THE WIND THE ABUNDANCE OF SNOW DUST AND THE FORM OF THE NORTH SIDES OF THE PEAKS
IN STILL GRANDER CHARACTERS A WONDERFUL WINTER SCENE I HAD LONG BEEN ANXIOUS TO STUDY SOME POINTS IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE ICE HILL AT THE FOOT OF THE UPPER YOSEMITE FALL
HE LOOKED DOWN AND SAW AN ALDERMAN SAILING UP THROUGH THE AIR TOWARDS HIM THIS ALDERMAN WAS BEING TRANSLATED INSTEAD OF BEING TRANSPORTED OWING TO A MISPRINT IN THE LAW AND AS HE CAME NEAR
BECAUSE IT WAS TEDIOUS TO SAIL BY THEM THEN THE COAST BECAME INDENTED WITH CREEKS AND THEY DIRECTED THEIR SHIPS ALONG THE CREEKS NOW BEFORE THIS WHEN LEIF WAS WITH KING OLAF TRYGGVASON AND THE KING HAD REQUESTED HIM TO PREACH CHRISTIANITY IN GREENLAND
MANY AND SO GREAT THAT TWO MEN MIGHT WELL LIE ON THEM STRETCHED ON THEIR BACKS WITH HEEL TO HEEL POLAR FOXES WERE THERE IN ABUNDANCE THIS LAND THEY GAVE NAME TO AND CALLED IT HELLULAND
IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THOU ART SOMEWHAT MORE TACITURN THAN THOU HAST BEEN STILL THOU HELPEST US WITH MUCH LIBERALITY
ITS HOT RAYS COOLED HIM OFF SOMEWHAT SO THAT HE BEGAN LOOKING ABOUT CURIOUSLY AT ALL THE STRANGE SIGHTS AND WONDERING WHERE ON EARTH HE WAS BY AND BY A FARMER CAME ALONG THE ROAD BY THE RIVER
AND BLOWN HORIZONTALLY ALONG THE FACE OF THE CLIFF LEAVING THE ICE HILL DRY AND WHILE MAKING MY WAY TO THE TOP OF FERN LEDGE TO SEIZE SO FAVORABLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK DOWN ITS THROAT
AND THEN HE SAILED OUT OF SIGHT AND LEFT THE MAN IN THE MOON TO REFLECT UPON WHAT HE HAD SAID THE WORDS OF THE ALDERMAN MADE HIM MORE ANXIOUS THAN EVER TO VISIT THE EARTH AND SO HE WALKED THOUGHTFULLY HOME
AND THE MAN WAS SO HUNGRY THAT HE TOOK A BIG SPOONFUL AT ONCE BUT NO SOONER HAD HE PUT IT INTO HIS MOUTH THAN HE UTTERED A GREAT YELL AND BEGAN DANCING FRANTICALLY ABOUT THE ROOM FOR OF COURSE
IN THAT SPOT THERE WAS LITTLE HOWEVER TO BE GOT FOR FOOD BUT THEIR CATTLE FOUND GOOD SUSTENANCE AFTER THAT THEY CALLED UPON GOD PRAYING THAT HE WOULD SEND THEM SOME LITTLE STORE OF MEAT BUT THEIR PRAYER WAS NOT SO SOON GRANTED AS THEY WERE EAGER THAT IT SHOULD BE
I WAS AWAKENED EARLY IN THE MORNING BY A WILD STORM WIND AND OF COURSE I HAD TO MAKE HASTE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE VALLEY TO ENJOY IT RUGGED TORRENTS AND AVALANCHES
SHAKING THE WHOLE VALLEY INTO ONE HUGE SONG YET INCONCEIVABLE AS IT MUST SEEM EVEN TO THOSE WHO LOVE ALL NATURE'S WILDNESS THE STORM WAS TELLING ITS STORY ON THE MOUNTAINS
AND WHAT WAS COLD HERE WAS HOT THERE SO HE BEGAN TO THINK THE MAN HAD TOLD THE TRUTH THEREFORE HE BEGGED THE MAGISTRATE TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES WHILE HE LOOKED THROUGH HIS TELESCOPE TO SEE IF THE MAN IN THE MOON WAS THERE
TO STAY WITH EIRIK DURING THE WINTER WHEN NOW YULE WAS DRAWING NIGH EIRIK BEGAN TO LOOK MORE GLOOMY THAN HE WAS WONT TO BE PRESENTLY KARLSEFNI ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM AND SAID ART THOU IN TROUBLE EIRIK
THE MAN IN THE MOON CALLED TO HIM AND SAID HOW IS EVERYTHING DOWN ON THE EARTH EVERYTHING IS LOVELY REPLIED THE ALDERMAN AND I WOULD N'T LEAVE IT IF I WAS NOT OBLIGED TO
FOR OF COURSE AS HE WAS THE ONLY MAN IN THE MOON
DURING THE FIVE WINTERS THAT I SPENT IN YOSEMITE I MADE MANY EXCURSIONS TO HIGH POINTS ABOVE THE WALLS IN ALL KINDS OF WEATHER TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE FROM ALL MY LOFTY OUTLOOKS
WILL YOU HAVE IT HOT OR COLD SIR OH COLD BY ALL MEANS REPLIED THE MAN FOR I DETEST ANYTHING HOT TO EAT SHE SOON BROUGHT HIM A BOWL OF COLD PEASE PORRIDGE
CAME IN SIGHT OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE SOUTH DOME EACH WAVING A WHITE GLOWING BANNER AGAINST THE DARK BLUE SKY AS REGULAR IN FORM AND FIRM AND FINE IN TEXTURE
FROM WHENCE THEY LOOKED A GOOD DEAL SMALLER BUT HE PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND SAID TO THE FARMER CAN YOU TELL ME THE WAY TO NORWICH SIR NORWICH REPEATED THE FARMER MUSINGLY
AND ON EVERY SUMMIT A MAGNIFICENT SILVERY BANNER FROM TWO THOUSAND TO SIX THOUSAND FEET IN LENGTH SLENDER AT THE POINT OF ATTACHMENT AND WIDENING GRADUALLY UNTIL ABOUT A THOUSAND
AND NOW AFTER THIS GENERAL VIEW MARK HOW SHARPLY THE RIBS AND BUTTRESSES AND SUMMITS OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE DEFINED EXCEPTING THE PORTIONS VEILED BY THE BANNERS
AMIDST ALL THE BUSTLE AND STIR OF THE PROUD AND BUSY CITY IN WHICH I AM DWELLING THE IMAGE OF THOSE THREE TREES SEEMS TO COME AS VIVIDLY BEFORE MY EYES AS IF THEY WERE ACTUALLY PRESENT
SEVERAL TIMES AFTER I REPEATED THE SAME MANOEUVRE BUT WITH AS LITTLE SUCCESS AS BEFORE AS MY PRETENCE FOR WITHDRAWING FROM THE HOUSE WAS TO ALLAY MY THIRST KORY KORY EITHER SUSPECTING SOME DESIGN ON MY PART
GRASPING THE CALABASH ON HEARING MY REPLY THEY SANK BACK AGAIN AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO I RETURNED TO MY MAT ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE SAVAGES TURNING RESTLESSLY
FROM WHENCE THEY ARE DRAWN AS OCCASION MAY REQUIRE IN THIS CONDITION THE TUTAO SOMETIMES REMAINS FOR YEARS AND EVEN IS THOUGHT TO IMPROVE BY AGE BEFORE IT IS FIT TO BE EATEN HOWEVER IT HAS TO UNDERGO AN ADDITIONAL PROCESS
IT HAS A MILD AND PLEASING FLAVOUR SOMETIMES AFTER HAVING BEEN ROASTED IN THE FIRE THE NATIVES SNATCH IT BRISKLY FROM THE EMBERS AND PERMITTING IT TO SLIP OUT OF THE YIELDING RIND INTO A VESSEL OF COLD WATER
INDUCES ME TO GIVE AT SOME LENGTH A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE TREE AND THE VARIOUS MODES IN WHICH THE FRUIT IS PREPARED THE BREAD FRUIT TREE IN ITS GLORIOUS PRIME IS A GRAND AND TOWERING OBJECT
WHEN ANY OF THE INMATES CHOSE TO GO OUTSIDE THE NOISE OCCASIONED BY THE REMOVING OF THIS RUDE DOOR AWAKENED EVERY BODY ELSE AND ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION I HAD REMARKED THAT THE ISLANDERS WERE NEARLY AS IRRITABLE AS MORE CIVILIZED BEINGS UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES
ITS SURFACE IS DOTTED ALL OVER WITH LITTLE CONICAL PROMINENCES LOOKING NOT UNLIKE THE KNOBS ON AN ANTIQUATED CHURCH DOOR THE RIND IS PERHAPS AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS AND DENUDED OF THIS
AND AT ONCE TAKE THE ROUTE TO PUEEARKA THE VERY NIGHT WHICH FOLLOWED MARNOO'S DEPARTURE I PROCEEDED TO PUT THIS PROJECT INTO EXECUTION ABOUT MIDNIGHT AS I IMAGINED I AROSE AND DREW THE SLIDE
OR ELSE PROMPTED BY A DESIRE TO PLEASE ME REGULARLY EVERY EVENING PLACED A CALABASH OF WATER BY MY SIDE EVEN UNDER THESE INAUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES I AGAIN AND AGAIN RENEWED THE ATTEMPT
THE BREAD FRUIT HOWEVER IS NEVER USED AND IS INDEED ALTOGETHER UNFIT TO BE EATEN UNTIL SUBMITTED IN ONE FORM OR OTHER TO THE ACTION OF FIRE THE MOST SIMPLE MANNER IN WHICH THIS OPERATION IS PERFORMED AND I THINK THE BEST
THE RECEPTION HE MET WITH FROM ITS INMATES TO MY JOY HIS APPEARANCE WAS HAILED WITH THE LIVELIEST PLEASURE AND ACCOSTING ME KINDLY HE SEATED HIMSELF BY MY SIDE AND ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH THE NATIVES AROUND HIM
AH THEN SOME NIGHT KANAKA ALL MOEE MOEE SLEEP YOU RUN AWAY YOU COME PUEEARKA I SPEAK PUEEARKA KANAKA HE NO HARM YOU AH THEN I TAKE YOU MY CANOE NUKUHEVA
WITH A FORCE AND RAPIDITY WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING ALTHOUGH THESE SAVAGES ARE REMARKABLY FOND OF CHANTING STILL THEY APPEAR TO HAVE NO IDEA WHATEVER OF SINGING
WITH A VIEW OF CAREFULLY NOTING THE PATH HE WOULD TAKE IN LEAVING THE VALLEY
THEY WOULD DISPERSE IN ALL DIRECTIONS MUCH TO THE ENJOYMENT OF MEHEVI THE CHIEFS AND THEMSELVES THE NOBLE ART OF SELF DEFENCE APPEARED TO BE REGARDED BY THEM AS THE PECULIAR GIFT OF THE WHITE MAN
WHEN I REFLECTED THAT MY DREADFUL FATE WOULD FOR EVER BE CONCEALED FROM THEM AND THAT WITH HOPE DEFERRED THEY MIGHT CONTINUE TO AWAIT MY RETURN LONG AFTER MY INANIMATE FORM HAD BLENDED WITH THE DUST OF THE VALLEY
AFTER BATHING AS THEY SOMETIMES DO FIVE OR SIX TIMES EVERY DAY THE HAIR IS CAREFULLY DRIED AND IF THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE SEA INVARIABLY WASHED IN FRESH WATER AND ANOINTED WITH A HIGHLY SCENTED OIL EXTRACTED FROM THE MEAT OF THE COCOANUT
AND HAS FOUR OR FIVE STOPS WITH A LARGE HOLE NEAR ONE END WHICH LATTER IS HELD JUST BENEATH THE LEFT NOSTRIL THE OTHER NOSTRIL BEING CLOSED BY A PECULIAR MOVEMENT OF THE MUSCLES ABOUT THE NOSE THE BREATH IS FORCED INTO THE TUBE
THE NATIVES JUST AS I HAD EXPECTED STARTED UP WHILE SOME OF THEM ASKED
THE MEN HOWEVER ARE NOT QUITE SO HARMONIOUS IN THEIR UTTERANCE AND WHEN EXCITED UPON ANY SUBJECT WOULD WORK THEMSELVES UP INTO A SORT OF WORDY PAROXYSM DURING WHICH ALL DESCRIPTIONS OF ROUGH SIDED SOUNDS WERE PROJECTED FROM THEIR MOUTHS
TO SAVAGES GENERALLY IS IMPUTED A GUTTURAL ARTICULATION THIS HOWEVER IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE ESPECIALLY AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF THE POLYNESIAN ARCHIPELAGO
I MIGHT YET EFFECT MY ESCAPE SHORTLY AFTER MARNOO'S VISIT I WAS REDUCED TO SUCH A STATE THAT IT WAS WITH EXTREME DIFFICULTY I COULD WALK EVEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A SPEAR AND KORY KORY AS FORMERLY
AND LOOKING SIGNIFICANTLY AT ME EXCLAIMED NOW YOU SEE YOU DO WHAT I TELL YOU AH THEN YOU DO GOOD YOU NO DO SO AH THEN YOU DIE
AND EVEN DURING THE HOURS DEVOTED TO SLUMBER THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT WHICH I MADE SEEMED TO ATTRACT THE NOTICE OF THOSE WHO SHARED THE MATS WITH ME IN SPITE OF THESE OBSTACLES HOWEVER I DETERMINED FORTHWITH TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT
THERE ARE NO OTHER MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AMONG THE TYPEES EXCEPT ONE WHICH MIGHT APPROPRIATELY BE DENOMINATED A NASAL FLUTE IT IS SOMEWHAT LONGER THAN AN ORDINARY FIFE IS MADE OF A BEAUTIFUL SCARLET COLOURED REED
IN THE COOL OF THE MORNING AND EVENING AND TREATING IT TO A BATH NO WONDER THAT THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDERS ARE SO AMPHIBIOUS A RACE WHEN THEY ARE THUS LAUNCHED INTO THE WATER AS SOON AS THEY SEE THE LIGHT
THE STICK IS SOMETIMES A GROTESQUELY FORMED LIMB OF A TREE WITH THREE OR FOUR BRANCHES TWISTING FROM ITS BODY LIKE SO MANY SHAPELESS LEGS AND SUSTAINING IT TWO OR THREE FEET FROM THE GROUND THE NATIVE
WOULD COMMENCE A LOW DISMAL AND MONOTONOUS CHANT ACCOMPANYING THE VOICE WITH THE INSTRUMENTAL MELODY PRODUCED BY TWO SMALL HALF ROTTEN STICKS TAPPED SLOWLY TOGETHER A PAIR OF WHICH WERE HELD IN THE HANDS OF EACH PERSON PRESENT
SOMETIMES WHEN AFTER FALLING INTO A KIND OF DOZE AND AWAKING SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF THESE DOLEFUL CHANTINGS MY EYE WOULD FALL UPON THE WILD LOOKING GROUP ENGAGED IN THEIR STRANGE OCCUPATION WITH THEIR NAKED TATTOOED LIMBS
AT MY REQUEST MY MATS WERE ALWAYS SPREAD DIRECTLY FACING THE DOOR OPPOSITE WHICH AND AT A LITTLE DISTANCE WAS THE HUT OF BOUGHS THAT MARHEYO WAS BUILDING WHENEVER MY GENTLE FAYAWAY AND KORY KORY
THE KING WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE VERSE BUT THE CHORUS FAIRLY TRANSPORTED HIM AT HIS SOLICITATION I SANG IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE LUDICROUS THAN HIS VAIN ATTEMPTS TO CATCH THE AIR AND THE WORDS
AND IN THE END HE GAVE IT UP AND CONSOLED HIMSELF BY LISTENING TO MY REPETITION OF THE SOUNDS FIFTY TIMES OVER PREVIOUS TO MEHEVI'S MAKING THE DISCOVERY I HAD NEVER BEEN AWARE THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING OF THE NIGHTINGALE ABOUT ME
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IDLE FOR ME TO HAVE ATTEMPTED RESUMING THE INTERVIEW SO PEREMPTORILY TERMINATED BY MARNOO
WHOM I INVARIABLY MADE TO KNOCK UNDER TO MY SUPERIOR PROWESS SOMETIMES WHEN THIS SORELY BATTERED SHADOW RETREATED PRECIPITATELY TOWARDS A GROUP OF THE SAVAGES AND FOLLOWING HIM UP I RUSHED AMONG THEM DEALING MY BLOWS RIGHT AND LEFT
GLOOMILY PONDERING OVER THE FATE WHICH IT APPEARED NOW IDLE FOR ME TO RESIST WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE LOVED FRIENDS WHO WERE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM THE SAVAGE ISLAND IN WHICH I WAS HELD A CAPTIVE
FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING VARIOUS SPECIES OF RARE SEA WEED SOME OF WHICH AMONG THESE PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERED A GREAT LUXURY AFTER A WHOLE DAY SPENT IN THIS EMPLOYMENT HE WOULD RETURN ABOUT NIGHTFALL WITH SEVERAL COCOANUT SHELLS FILLED WITH DIFFERENT DESCRIPTIONS OF KELP
THIS PASSAGE FOR NO CONCEIVABLE REASON THAT I COULD DEVISE WAS ALWAYS CLOSED AFTER THE HOUSEHOLD HAD RETIRED TO REST BY DRAWING A HEAVY SLIDE ACROSS IT COMPOSED OF A DOZEN OR MORE BITS OF WOOD INGENIOUSLY FASTENED TOGETHER BY SEIZINGS OF SINNATE
FORMING THE SAME FEATURE IN A MARQUESAN LANDSCAPE THAT THE PATRIARCHAL ELM DOES IN NEW ENGLAND SCENERY THE LATTER TREE IT NOT A LITTLE RESEMBLES IN HEIGHT IN THE WIDE SPREAD OF ITS STALWART BRANCHES
IT WAS IN FAYAWAY'S DELICATE LITTLE HANDS ONE OF THE MOST GRACEFUL I HAVE EVER SEEN A YOUNG LADY IN THE ACT OF TORMENTING A GUITAR STRUNG ABOUT HER NECK BY A COUPLE OF YARDS OF BLUE RIBBON IS NOT HALF SO ENGAGING
HE SAID YOU TABOO WHY YOU NO LIKE TO STAY PLENTY MOEE MOEE SLEEP PLENTY KI KI EAT PLENTY WAHENEE YOUNG GIRLS OH VERY GOOD PLACE TYPEE
THE DIFFICULTY THUS PLACED IN MY WAY I DETERMINED TO OBVIATE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER I WOULD GET UP BOLDLY IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT AND DRAWING THE SLIDE ISSUE FROM THE HOUSE AND PRETEND THAT MY OBJECT WAS MERELY TO PROCURE A DRINK FROM THE CALABASH
AND SHAVEN HEADS DISPOSED IN A CIRCLE
WHEN I OBSERVED A WOMAN SITTING UPON A ROCK IN THE MIDST OF THE CURRENT AND WATCHING WITH THE LIVELIEST INTEREST THE GAMBOLS OF SOMETHING WHICH AT FIRST I TOOK TO BE AN UNCOMMONLY LARGE SPECIES OF FROG THAT WAS SPORTING IN THE WATER NEAR HER
I NATURALLY THOUGHT THAT ANYTHING COLLECTED AT SUCH PAINS MUST POSSESS PECULIAR MERITS BUT ONE MOUTHFUL WAS A COMPLETE DOSE AND GREAT WAS THE CONSTERNATION OF THE OLD WARRIOR AT THE RAPIDITY WITH WHICH I EJECTED HIS EPICUREAN TREAT
YOU SEE AH BY BY YOU NO MIND YOU GET WELL HE KILL YOU EAT YOU HANG YOU HEAD UP THERE LIKE HAPPAR KANAKA NOW YOU LISTEN BUT NO TALK ANY MORE BY BY I GO YOU SEE WAY I GO
GIVING A MUSICAL PROLONGATION TO THE FINAL SYLLABLE OF EVERY SENTENCE AND CHIRPING OUT SOME OF THE WORDS WITH A LIQUID BIRD LIKE ACCENT WAS SINGULARLY PLEASING
THE OIL UNDERGOES A PURIFYING PROCESS AND IS THEN POURED INTO THE SMALL SPHERICAL SHELLS OF THE NUTS OF THE MOO TREE WHICH ARE HOLLOWED OUT TO RECEIVE IT THESE NUTS ARE THEN HERMETICALLY SEALED WITH A RESINOUS GUM
AND THE VEGETABLE FRAGRANCE OF THEIR GREEN RIND SOON IMPARTS TO THE OIL A DELIGHTFUL ODOUR AFTER THE LAPSE OF A FEW WEEKS THE EXTERIOR SHELL OF THE NUTS BECOMES QUITE DRY AND HARD AND ASSUMES A BEAUTIFUL CARNATION TINT
WITH WHICH THEY SET TO IN COLUMN AND PUMMELLED ONE ANOTHER AT THE WORD OF COMMAND ONE DAY IN COMPANY WITH KORY KORY I HAD REPAIRED TO THE STREAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF BATHING
FROM THE EXTRAVAGANT VALUE PLACED UPON THE ARTICLE I VERILY BELIEVE THAT WITH A BUSHEL OF COMMON LIVERPOOL SALT ALL THE REAL ESTATE IN TYPEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED WITH A SMALL PINCH OF IT IN ONE HAND
ENVELOPED IN MULTITUDINOUS FOLDS OF LEAVES AND AS A SPECIAL MARK OF THE ESTEEM IN WHICH THEY HELD ME WOULD SPREAD AN IMMENSE LEAF ON THE GROUND AND DROPPING ONE BY ONE A FEW MINUTE PARTICLES OF THE SALT UPON IT INVITE ME TO TASTE THEM
I COULD NOT REPRESS A SHUDDER OF ANGUISH HOW VIVIDLY IS IMPRESSED UPON MY MIND EVERY MINUTE FEATURE OF THE SCENE WHICH MET MY VIEW DURING THOSE LONG DAYS OF SUFFERING AND SORROW
AND KORY KORY HAD FREQUENT OCCASION TO SHOW HIS SKILL IN THEIR USE BUT THE GREAT STAPLE ARTICLES OF FOOD INTO WHICH THE BREAD FRUIT IS CONVERTED BY THESE NATIVES ARE KNOWN RESPECTIVELY BY THE NAMES OF AMAR AND POEE POEE
OR WHETHER IT BE PERMITTED TO FLOW OVER THE SHOULDERS IN NATURAL RINGLETS IT IS ALWAYS THE PRIDE OF THE OWNER AND THE GLORY OF THE TOILETTE THE TYPEE GIRLS DEVOTE MUCH OF THEIR TIME TO THE DRESSING OF THEIR FAIR AND REDUNDANT LOCKS
I DISCLOSED IT IN A FEW BRIEF WORDS TO THE STRANGER AND ASKED HIM HOW IT COULD BE BEST ACCOMPLISHED MY HEART SUNK WITHIN ME WHEN IN HIS BROKEN ENGLISH HE ANSWERED ME THAT IT COULD NEVER BE EFFECTED KANAKA NO LET YOU GO NOWHERE
SADLY DISCURSIVE AS I HAVE ALREADY BEEN I MUST STILL FURTHER ENTREAT THE READER'S PATIENCE AS I AM ABOUT TO STRING TOGETHER WITHOUT ANY ATTEMPT AT ORDER A FEW ODDS AND ENDS OF THINGS NOT HITHERTO MENTIONED
WHETHER AGAINST THE EXPRESS WILL OF PROVIDENCE IT IS TWISTED UPON THE CROWN OF THE HEAD AND THERE COILED AWAY LIKE A ROPE ON A SHIP'S DECK WHETHER IT BE STUCK BEHIND THE EARS AND HANGS DOWN LIKE THE SWAG OF A SMALL WINDOW CURTAIN
HE WOULD PURSUE HIS QUIET WORK SITTING IN THE SHADE AND WEAVING TOGETHER THE LEAFLETS OF HIS COCOANUT BRANCHES OR ROLLING UPON HIS KNEE THE TWISTED FIBRES OF BARK TO FORM THE CORDS WITH WHICH HE TIED TOGETHER THE THATCHING OF HIS TINY HOUSE
TO THE GRATIFICATION OF MY PALATE THEY PAID THE MOST UNWEARIED ATTENTION THEY CONTINUALLY INVITED ME TO PARTAKE OF FOOD
THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE GATHERED TOGETHER ON THE MATS
LAYING THEMSELVES DOWN BESIDE ME WOULD LEAVE ME AWHILE TO UNINTERRUPTED REPOSE I TOOK A STRANGE INTEREST IN THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENTS OF THE ECCENTRIC OLD WARRIOR ALL ALONE DURING THE STILLNESS OF THE TROPICAL MID DAY
THIS PREPARATION IS CALLED KOKOO AND A MOST LUSCIOUS PREPARATION IT IS THE HOBBY HORSE AND THE PESTLE AND MORTAR WERE IN GREAT REQUISITION DURING THE TIME I REMAINED IN THE HOUSE OF MARHEYO
BUT WHEN I DID SO MY VALET ALWAYS ROSE WITH ME AS IF DETERMINED I SHOULD NOT REMOVE MYSELF FROM HIS OBSERVATION FOR THE PRESENT THEREFORE I WAS OBLIGED TO ABANDON THE ATTEMPT BUT I ENDEAVOURED TO CONSOLE MYSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT BY THIS MODE
ATTRACTED BY THE NOVELTY OF THE SIGHT I WADED TOWARDS THE SPOT WHERE SHE SAT AND COULD HARDLY CREDIT THE EVIDENCE OF MY SENSES WHEN I BEHELD A LITTLE INFANT THE PERIOD OF WHOSE BIRTH COULD NOT HAVE EXTENDED BACK MANY DAYS PADDLING ABOUT
HOW TRUE IT IS THAT THE RARITY OF ANY PARTICULAR ARTICLE ENHANCES ITS VALUE AMAZINGLY IN SOME PART OF THE VALLEY I KNOW NOT WHERE BUT PROBABLY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE SEA
THE FLEETING SHADES OF THE EXPIRING DOLPHIN THE AUTUMNAL TINTS OF OUR AMERICAN FORESTS GLORIOUS AS THEY ARE SINK INTO NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH THIS TREE
ALL THE INHABITANTS OF THE VALLEY TREATED ME WITH GREAT KINDNESS BUT AS TO THE HOUSEHOLD OF MARHEYO WITH WHOM I WAS NOW PERMANENTLY DOMICILED NOTHING COULD SURPASS THEIR EFFORTS TO MINISTER TO MY COMFORT
FREQUENTLY SUSPENDING HIS EMPLOYMENT AND NOTICING MY MELANCHOLY EYE FIXED UPON HIM HE WOULD RAISE HIS HAND WITH A GESTURE EXPRESSIVE OF DEEP COMMISERATION AND THEN MOVING TOWARDS ME SLOWLY WOULD ENTER ON TIP TOES
STIR UP THE MIXTURE WHICH THEY CALL BO A SHO I NEVER COULD ENDURE THIS COMPOUND AND INDEED THE PREPARATION IS NOT GREATLY IN VOGUE AMONG THE MORE POLITE TYPEES THERE IS ONE FORM HOWEVER IN WHICH THE FRUIT IS OCCASIONALLY SERVED
WAS SOON OUT OF SIGHT A MODE OF ESCAPE WAS NOW PRESENTED TO ME BUT HOW WAS I TO AVAIL MYSELF OF IT I WAS CONTINUALLY SURROUNDED BY THE SAVAGES I COULD NOT STIR FROM ONE HOUSE TO ANOTHER WITHOUT BEING ATTENDED BY SOME OF THEM
HIS NATIVE VALLEY AND THAT HE INTENDED TO RETURN TO IT THE SAME DAY AT ONCE IT STRUCK ME THAT COULD I BUT REACH THAT VALLEY UNDER HIS PROTECTION I MIGHT EASILY FROM THENCE REACH NUKUHEVA BY WATER AND ANIMATED BY THE PROSPECT WHICH THIS PLAN HELD OUT
SUPPOSE YOU NO LIKE THIS BAY WHY YOU COME YOU NO HEAR ABOUT TYPEE ALL WHITE MEN AFRAID TYPEE SO NO WHITE MEN COME THESE WORDS DISTRESSED ME BEYOND BELIEF
CONSISTS IN PLACING ANY NUMBER OF THE FRESHLY PLUCKED FRUIT WHEN IN A PARTICULAR STATE OF GREENNESS AMONG THE EMBERS OF A FIRE IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU WOULD ROAST A POTATO AFTER THE LAPSE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN MINUTES THE GREEN RIND EMBROWNS AND CRACKS
ITS MERITS AS A PREPARATION FOR THE HAIR ARE UNDENIABLE
THIS OIL IS OBTAINED IN GREAT ABUNDANCE BY THE FOLLOWING VERY SIMPLE PROCESS A LARGE VESSEL OF WOOD WITH HOLES PERFORATED IN THE BOTTOM IS FILLED WITH THE POUNDED MEAT AND EXPOSED TO THE RAYS OF THE SUN
WHILE ONE PERSON IS PERFORMING THIS OPERATION ANOTHER TAKES A RIPE COCOANUT
ONCE MORE THE APPROACH OF THE STRANGER WAS HERALDED AND THE INTELLIGENCE OPERATED UPON ME LIKE MAGIC AGAIN I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONVERSE WITH HIM IN MY OWN LANGUAGE AND I RESOLVE AT ALL HAZARDS TO CONCERT WITH HIM SOME SCHEME HOWEVER DESPERATE
BUT THE PLAN HE HAD SUGGESTED STRUCK ME AS ONE WHICH MIGHT POSSIBLY BE ACCOMPLISHED AND I RESOLVED TO ACT UPON IT AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE ACCORDINGLY WHEN HE AROSE TO DEPART I ACCOMPANIED HIM WITH THE NATIVES OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE
AND PRODUCES A SOFT DULCET SOUND WHICH IS VARIED BY THE FINGERS RUNNING AT RANDOM OVER THE STOPS THIS IS A FAVOURITE RECREATION WITH THE FEMALES AND ONE IN WHICH FAYAWAY GREATLY EXCELLED AWKWARD AS SUCH AN INSTRUMENT MAY APPEAR
IT WAS ALSO BY NIGHT ALONE THAT I COULD HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH MY OBJECT AND THEN ONLY BY ADOPTING THE UTMOST PRECAUTION THE ENTRANCE TO MARHEYO'S HABITATION WAS THROUGH A LOW NARROW OPENING IN ITS WICKER WORK FRONT
AND THE NEXT MOMENT BE CLASPED TO ITS MOTHER'S BOSOM THIS WAS REPEATED AGAIN AND AGAIN THE BABY REMAINING IN THE STREAM ABOUT A MINUTE AT A TIME ONCE OR TWICE IT MADE WRY FACES AT SWALLOWING A MOUTHFUL OF WATER
AND YOU RUN AWAY SHIP NO MORE WITH THESE WORDS ENFORCED BY A VEHEMENCE OF GESTURE I CANNOT DESCRIBE MARNOO STARTED FROM MY SIDE AND IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH SOME OF THE CHIEFS WHO HAD ENTERED THE HOUSE
THE FRUIT SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES IN MAGNITUDE AND GENERAL APPEARANCE ONE OF OUR CITRON MELONS OF ORDINARY SIZE BUT UNLIKE THE CITRON IT HAS NO SECTIONAL LINES DRAWN ALONG THE OUTSIDE
BUT I WAS NOW PROMOTED TO THE PLACE OF COURT MINSTREL IN WHICH CAPACITY I WAS AFTERWARDS PERPETUALLY CALLED UPON TO OFFICIATE BESIDES THE STICKS AND THE DRUMS
IN THE MIDST OF MY SOLITARY MUSINGS IT IS STRANGE HOW INANIMATE OBJECTS WILL TWINE THEMSELVES INTO OUR AFFECTIONS ESPECIALLY IN THE HOUR OF AFFLICTION EVEN NOW
IS OFTEN CONVERTED BY THE NATIVES INTO A SUPERB AND STRIKING HEAD DRESS THE PRINCIPAL FIBRE TRAVERSING ITS LENGTH BEING SPLIT OPEN A CONVENIENT DISTANCE AND THE ELASTIC SIDES OF THE APERTURE PRESSED APART THE HEAD IS INSERTED BETWEEN THEM
AND A QUARTER SECTION OF A BREAD FRUIT IN THE OTHER THE GREATEST CHIEF IN THE VALLEY WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT ALL LUXURIES OF A PARISIAN TABLE THE CELEBRITY OF THE BREAD FRUIT TREE AND THE CONSPICUOUS PLACE IT OCCUPIES IN A TYPEE BILL OF FARE
AS NOT ONE OF THE NATIVES HAD SOUL ENOUGH IN HIM TO STAND UP LIKE A MAN AND ALLOW ME TO HAMMER AWAY AT HIM FOR MY OWN PERSONAL GRATIFICATION AND THAT OF THE KING I WAS NECESSITATED TO FIGHT WITH AN IMAGINARY ENEMY
BUT WHICH ARE EITHER CURIOUS IN THEMSELVES OR PECULIAR TO THE TYPEES THERE WAS ONE SINGULAR CUSTOM OBSERVED IN OLD MARHEYO'S DOMESTIC ESTABLISHMENT WHICH OFTEN EXCITED MY SURPRISE EVERY NIGHT BEFORE RETIRING
FIRST PLACING A CALABASH BENEATH THE NOSE AS IT WERE OF HIS CURIOUS LOOKING LOG STEED FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING THE GRATED FRAGMENTS AS THEY FALL MOUNTS ASTRIDE OF IT AS IF IT WERE A HOBBY HORSE
THIS IS THE FORM IN WHICH THE TUTAO IS GENERALLY CONSUMED THE SINGULAR MODE OF EATING IT I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED WERE IT NOT THAT THE BREAD FRUIT IS THUS CAPABLE OF BEING PRESERVED FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
I WOULD PURPOSELY OMIT CLOSING THE PASSAGE AFTER ME AND TRUSTING THAT THE INDOLENCE OF THE SAVAGES WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM REPAIRING MY NEGLECT WOULD RETURN TO MY MAT AND WAITING PATIENTLY UNTIL ALL WERE AGAIN ASLEEP I WOULD THEN STEAL FORTH
AND WHEN OPENED THEY ARE FOUND TO BE ABOUT TWO THIRDS FULL OF AN OINTMENT OF A LIGHT YELLOW COLOUR AND DIFFUSING THE SWEETEST PERFUME THIS ELEGANT LITTLE ODOROUS GLOBE WOULD NOT BE OUT OF PLACE EVEN UPON THE TOILETTE OF A QUEEN
THAT RENDERS IT A DISH FIT FOR A KING AS SOON AS IT IS TAKEN FROM THE FIRE THE EXTERIOR IS REMOVED THE CORE EXTRACTED AND THE REMAINING PART IS PLACED IN A SORT OF SHALLOW STONE MORTAR AND BRISKLY WORKED WITH A PESTLE OF THE SAME SUBSTANCE
AND OVERSPREAD WITH ANOTHER LAYER OF LEAVES THE WHOLE IS THEN QUICKLY HEAPED UP WITH EARTH AND FORMS A SLOPING MOUND THE TUTAO THUS BAKED IS CALLED AMAR
FEARFUL OF DISTURBING THE SLUMBERING NATIVES AND TAKING THE FAN FROM MY HAND WOULD SIT BEFORE ME SWAYING IT GENTLY TO AND FRO AND GAZING EARNESTLY INTO MY FACE
THIS STATELY TREE WHICH IS RARELY MET WITH UPON THE SANDWICH ISLANDS AND THEN ONLY OF A VERY INFERIOR QUALITY AND AT TAHITI DOES NOT ABOUND TO A DEGREE THAT RENDERS ITS FRUIT THE PRINCIPAL ARTICLE OF FOOD
IN PREPARING THESE FOR USE HE MANIFESTED ALL THE OSTENTATION OF A PROFESSED COOK ALTHOUGH THE CHIEF MYSTERY OF THE AFFAIR APPEARED TO CONSIST IN POURING WATER IN JUDICIOUS QUANTITIES UPON THE SLIMY CONTENTS OF HIS COCOANUT SHELLS
THE GIRLS WERE SOMETIMES IN THE HABIT OF PROCURING SMALL QUANTITIES OF SALT A THIMBLE FULL OR SO BEING THE RESULT OF THE UNITED LABOURS OF A PARTY OF FIVE OR SIX EMPLOYED FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY THIS PRECIOUS COMMODITY THEY BROUGHT TO THE HOUSE
APPEARED TO RESUME THEIR SLUMBERS AND REJOICING AT THE STILLNESS WHICH PREVAILED I WAS ABOUT TO RISE AGAIN FROM MY COUCH WHEN I HEARD A SLIGHT RUSTLING A DARK FORM WAS INTERCEPTED BETWEEN ME AND THE DOORWAY THE SLIDE WAS DRAWN ACROSS IT
PROCEEDS TO GRATE THE JUICY MEAT INTO FINE PARTICLES THIS IS DONE BY MEANS OF A PIECE OF MOTHER OF PEARL SHELL LASHED FIRMLY TO THE EXTREME END OF A HEAVY STICK WITH ITS STRAIGHT SIDE ACCURATELY NOTCHED LIKE A SAW
WERE THREE MAGNIFICENT BREAD FRUIT TREES AT THIS MOMENT I CAN RECAP TO MY MIND THEIR SLENDER SHAFTS AND THE GRACEFUL INEQUALITIES OF THEIR BARK ON WHICH MY EYE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DWELL DAY AFTER DAY
AT THE TIME WHEN IT IS IN THE GREATEST PERFECTION THE FRUIT PRESENTS A BEAUTIFUL GLOBE OF WHITE PULP THE WHOLE OF WHICH MAY BE EATEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SLENDER CORE WHICH IS EASILY REMOVED
THE SOUNDS PRODUCED BY THE NATIVES ON THESE OCCASIONS WERE OF A MOST SINGULAR DESCRIPTION AND HAD I NOT ACTUALLY BEEN PRESENT I NEVER WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT SUCH CURIOUS NOISES COULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED BY HUMAN BEINGS
AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHOEVER HE WAS RETURNED TO HIS MAT THIS WAS A SAD BLOW TO ME BUT AS IT MIGHT HAVE AROUSED THE SUSPICIONS OF THE ISLANDERS TO HAVE MADE ANOTHER ATTEMPT THAT NIGHT I WAS RELUCTANTLY OBLIGED TO DEFER IT UNTIL THE NEXT
TO RESCUE ME FROM A CONDITION THAT HAD NOW BECOME INSUPPORTABLE AS HE DREW NEAR I REMEMBERED WITH MANY MISGIVINGS THE INAUSPICIOUS TERMINATION OF OUR FORMER INTERVIEW AND WHEN HE ENTERED THE HOUSE I WATCHED WITH INTENSE ANXIETY
THE ACTION OF THE OVEN HAVING CONVERTED IT INTO AN AMBER COLOURED CAKY SUBSTANCE A LITTLE TART BUT NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO THE TASTE BY ANOTHER AND FINAL PROCESS THE AMAR IS CHANGED INTO POEE POEE
THE LEAF DROOPING ON ONE SIDE WITH ITS FORWARD HALF TURNED JAUNTILY UP ON THE BROWS AND THE REMAINING PART SPREADING LATERALLY BEHIND THE EARS
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TOMMO WAI WATER
THE FLICKERING RAYS OF THE ARMOR NUT JUST SERVED TO REVEAL THEIR SAVAGE LINEAMENTS WITHOUT DISPELLING THE DARKNESS THAT HOVERED ABOUT THEM
I AM CONVINCED THAT IT IS AS NATURAL FOR A HUMAN BEING TO SWIM AS IT IS FOR A DUCK AND YET IN CIVILIZED COMMUNITIES HOW MANY ABLE BODIED INDIVIDUALS DIE LIKE SO MANY DROWNING KITTENS FROM THE OCCURRENCE OF THE MOST TRIVIAL ACCIDENTS
THUS WOULD THEY EMPLOY THEMSELVES FOR AN HOUR OR TWO SOMETIMES LONGER LYING IN THE GLOOM WHICH WRAPPED THE FURTHER END OF THE HOUSE I COULD NOT AVOID LOOKING AT THEM
THE GOVERNOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND ALL THE EUROPEANS WERE INVITED SIX MONTHS HAD BEEN SPENT IN PREPARATIONS FOR THIS FETE AT WHICH AN EMPEROR AND TWENTY FIVE KINGS ASSISTED AND ATTENDED IN PERSON WITH ALL THEIR BODY GUARDS
LIKEWISE AMPLY TO SUPPLY THE SLAVE TRADE FROM THE PRISONERS OF BOTH PARTIES THEY HOWEVER SOME TIME SINCE MADE HEAD AGAINST THE COMMON ENEMY
THEY MADE AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE VESSEL FROM THEM WHICH THEY ALWAYS WILL TO A SMALL VESSEL WHEN ALONE BUT THEY WERE SOON OVERPOWERED WITH THE FIRE ARMS
AT THOSE ISLANDS WHICH WERE INHABITED AFTER MUCH DIVERSITY OF DISTRESS AND SIMILAR ENCOUNTERS THEY AT LAST MADE THE REEF THAT RUNS BETWEEN NEW GUINEA AND NEW HOLLAND WHERE THE PANDORA MET HER UNHAPPY FATE AND AFTER
AND AS THIS MERCIFUL ESCAPE WAS FROM THE VIGILANCE OF ONE WELLS WHO WAS LOOKING OUT AHEAD IT WAS CALLED WELLS'S SHOALS THOSE HAIR BREADTH ESCAPES MAY POINT OUT THE PROPRIETY OF A CONSORT
IN OUR PASSAGE FROM THIS TO THE CAPE BEFORE WE LEFT JAVA ONE OF THE CONVICTS HAD JUMPED OVER BOARD IN THE NIGHT AND SWAM TO THE DUTCH ARSENAL AT HONROOST
WE HAVE NO CAPTAIN FOR THEY HAD REPORTED THAT THE CAPTAIN AND REMAINDER OF THE CREW HAD SEPARATED FROM THEM AT SEA IN ANOTHER BOAT THIS IMMEDIATELY LED TO A SUSPICION OF THEIR BEING IMPOSTORS AND THEY WERE ORDERED TO BE APPREHENDED AND PUT INTO THE CASTLE
WHICH WE NAMED MOUNT TEMPLE
SOME OF THE PRISONERS WERE LET OUT OF IRONS AND TURNED TO THE PUMPS AT THIS DREADFUL CRISIS IT BLEW VERY VIOLENTLY AND SHE BEAT SO HARD UPON THE ROCKS THAT WE EXPECTED HER EVERY MINUTE TO GO TO PIECES
IMPERTINENCE IN ME TO MAKE ANY COMMENT ON IT BUT WHEN THE WHOLE GLOBE LENDS ITS AID TO SUPPLY THIS DESTRUCTIVE SETTLEMENT
COMPANY'S HEALTH LED US TO REQUEST AN EXPLANATION WHEN WE WERE INFORMED THEY FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE THEM BELIEVE
ON ACCOUNT OF THE BROKEN WATER AND THE VERY HIGH SURF THAT WAS RUNNING NEAR US WE BALED BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH FOR HAD SHE GONE DOWN BEFORE DAY LIGHT EVERY SOUL MUST HAVE PERISHED SHE NOW TOOK A HEEL AND SOME OF THE GUNS
WHICH CARRIES HUMILITY AND SUBMISSION IN IT THAT SORT OF BOW
TO THE WASTWARD OF BOUGAINVILLE'S TRACK THE OCEAN WAS PERFECTLY UNEXPLORED AT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON A SIGNAL WAS MADE FROM THE BOAT THAT A PASSAGE THROUGH THE REEF WAS DISCOVERED FOR THE SHIP
THAN ANY WE HAD SEEN FOR SOME TIME THEY HAVE FREQUENT INTERCOURSE WITH ANAMOOKA AND THEIR RELIGION
THEIR PERSON OR QUALITY MAY BE IDENTIFIED
SEEING OUR PASSAGE OBSTRUCTED AND STOOD OFF AND ON UNDER AN EASY SAIL
HE OVERPOWERED THEM ALL AND JUMPED OVERBOARD WITH HIS PRIZE
FOUND NO BOTTOM THIS WAS CALLED PANDORA'S REEF ON THE TWELFTH IN THE MORNING WE DISCOVERED AN ISLAND WELL WOODED BUT NOT INHABITED IT HAD TWO REMARKABLE PROMONTORIES ON IT
THIS EVENING
IN WHICH SAMARANG IS BUILT IT IS GAUDY AND CALCULATED TO PLEASE THE GENERALITY OF OBSERVERS ALLOW ME TO MENTION THE SINGULAR MANNER IN WHICH THE MONKEYS
WITH HILL AND DALE AND EQUALLY BEAUTIFUL AS DIVERSIFIED WITH ROTTI AND ITS APPENDANT ISLES IT IS AS LARGE AS THE ISLAND OF GREAT BRITAIN ITS PRINCIPAL TRADE
TO THROW ANY STIGMA ON THE DUTCH WHO I BELIEVE WOULD FIGHT THE DEVIL
WAS AT FIRST AWFUL IN THE EXTREME BUT AS THEY SUNK AND BECAME FAINT IT DIED AWAY BY DEGREES THE BOATS WHO WERE AT SOME CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE IN THE DRIFT OF THE TIDE
OR SHELTERING IN THE TRANSLUCENT STREAM FROM THE FERVOUR OF MERIDIAN HEAT YOU ARE SUDDENLY CHILLED WITH FEAR FROM THE TERRIFIC ASPECT OF THE ALLIGATOR
WERE EMPLOYED THRUMBING A TOPSAIL TO HAUL UNDER HER BOTTOM TO ENDEAVOUR TO FODDER HER TO ADD TO OUR DISTRESS AT THIS JUNCTURE ONE OF THE CHAIN PUMPS GAVE WAY AND SHE GAINED FAST UPON US
IS RECKONED NEXT TO BATAVIA AND IS SO LUCRATIVE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS CHANGED EVERY FIVE YEARS THE PRESENT GOVERNOR'S NAME IS OVERSTRAATEN A GENTLEMAN OF SPLENDID TASTE AND UNBOUNDED HOSPITALITY
AND WARLIKE STORES FEUDS AND DISSENTIONS ARE KINDLED AMONGST THEM AND THEY ARE KEPT SO COMPLETELY ENGAGED IN CIVIL WAR THAT THEY HAVE NO TIME TO OBSERVE THE ENCROACHMENTS OF STRANGERS THAT DOMESTIC STRIFE SERVES
THEY DRAGGED ALONG THE COAST OF NEW SOUTH WALES AND AS OFTEN AS THE HOSTILE NATURE OF THE SAVAGE NATIVES WOULD PERMIT HAULED THEIR BOAT UP AT NIGHT AND SLEPT ON SHORE THEY MET WITH SEVERAL CURIOUS AND INTERESTING ANECDOTES
SEEMS TO HAVE STUDIED WITH MUCH INGENUITY TO RENDER IT A CADAVEROUS STINKING PRISON AFTER BEING REFRESHED AT THE CAPE WE PASSED SAINT HELENA THE ISLAND OF ASCENSION AND ARRIVED AT HOLLAND
THE NATIVES BARTER THEIR PRODUCE AND SELL THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR WHO ARE CARRIED TO BATAVIA AS SLAVES AND THE NATIVES OF JAVA SENT FROM BATAVIA TO THIS PLACE IN RETURN AS THEY HOLD THEIR TENURE
THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO US IN OUR PRESENT DISTRESSED STATE HE RETURNED IN TWO HOURS AND BROUGHT WITH HIM A CAT WHICH HE FOUND CLINGING TO THE TOP GALLANT MAST HEAD A PIECE
THROUGH THE INTERPOSITION OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE TO BE AGAIN LANDED ON OUR NATIVE SHORE
WE WOULD GLADLY HAVE CONTINUED THE SAME CUSTOM BUT THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE VOYAGE WOULD NOT PERMIT IT
TO THE REST OF MANKIND IN POINT OF SIZE AND CONSTITUTION THAT THEY MAY BE CALLED NONDESCRIPTS THEIR HOSPITAL AS TO SCITE SURPASSES ANY IN THE WORLD IT MAY BE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT THE ARCHITECT
STRUCK ON A REEF OF ROCKS AND AT THAT INSTANT THE BOAT GOT ON BOARD EVERY POSSIBLE EFFORT WAS ATTEMPTED TO GET HER OFF BY THE SAILS
THEIR DISTRESS FOR WANT OF WATER IF POSSIBLE SURPASSED THAT OF OUR OWN AND HAD SO STRONG AN EFFECT ON ONE OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMEN THAT THE DAY FOLLOWING HE BECAME DELIRIOUS AND CONTINUED SO FOR SOME MONTHS AFTER IT
AND BIRDS UPON EVERY PART OF THEM SO THAT EVERY MAN WAS A MOVING LANDSCAPE THESE MARKS WERE ALL RAISED AND DONE I SUPPOSE BY PINCHING UP THE SKIN THEY WERE GREAT ADEPTS IN THIEVING AND UNCOMMONLY ATHLETIC AND STRONG
AND THEIR VESSEL BEING BUILT OF FOREIGN TIMBER SERVED TO CONFIRM THEM IN THEIR SUSPICIONS AND AS NO OFFICER IN THE BRITISH NAVY BEARS A COMMISSION OR WARRANT UNDER THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WHERE BY SEAL OF OFFICE
TO SEE THAT WEDGEWOOD'S STONEWARE AND BIRMINGHAM GOODS
THE SOUND ITSELF WAS CALLED CURTIS'S SOUND UNDER THE GENERAL DENOMINATION OF HOWE'S ISLANDS WERE INCLUDED
AS HE WAS PRECEDED BY MUSIC AND COLOURS FLYING EVERY ONE TURNED OUT TO SEE HIM AMONGST THE REST WAS A CAPTIVE KING IN CHAINS WHO WAS EMPLOYED BLOWING THE BELLOWS TO OUR ARMOURER
BUT OUR THIRST WAS TOO EXCESSIVE TO BEAR ANY THING
AND BIDDING HIM FAREWELL JUMPED OVER THE QUARTER INTO THE WATER THE CAPTAIN THEN FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE AND JUMPED AFTER HIM AT THAT INSTANT SHE TOOK HER LAST HEEL AND WHILE EVERY ONE WERE SCRAMBLING TO WINDWARD SHE SUNK
WOULD BE ASHAMED OF THE COMPASS OF MY WORK WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO BE PARTICULAR BUT I MUST INSTANCE ONE AMONG MANY OTHERS
WAS VALUABLE AND CONVENIENT TO THE DUTCH BUT FROM THE VAST EXTENT OF TERRITORY LATELY ACQUIRED IN INDIA WE HAVE PLENTY OF THAT COMMODITY WITHOUT GOING TO THE DUTCH MARKET CLOSE TO THE DUTCH TOWN IS A CHINESE TOWN AND TEMPLE
IT MAY BE REMARKED THAT THE STRAITS OF ALICE
THE BOAT WAS NOW SEEN CLOSE UNDER THE STERN WE WERE AT THE SAME TIME LYING TO TO PREVENT THE SHIP FORE REACHING IMMEDIATELY ON SOUNDING THIS LAST TIME
IN THE MORNING AT DAY LIGHT WE PUT ABOUT TO EXAMINE THE DANGER WE WERE IN AND FOUND WE HAD GOT EMBAYED IN A DOUBLE REEF WHICH WILL VERY SOON BE AN ISLAND
THERE WAS SOMETHING RESEMBLING A FORTIFICATION WE SAW AT THE SAME TIME THREE TWO MASTED BOATS WE KEPT RUNNING ALONG THE REEF AND IN THE FORENOON THOUGHT WE SAW AN OPENING
THAT THE ANCHOR ON OUR BOW WAS UNDER WATER
ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE DAY BREAK A COUNCIL OF WAR WAS HELD AMONGST THE OFFICERS
AND SOME SMALL ARMS AND AMMUNITION FROM A DUTCH SHIP THAT LAY THERE AND THE EXPEDITION WAS CONDUCTED BY THE GOVERNOR'S FISHERMAN WHOSE TIME OF TRANSPORTATION WAS EXPIRED HE WAS A GOOD SEAMAN AND A TOLERABLE NAVIGATOR
THIS WAS TAPPED AND SERVED REGULARLY TO ALL HANDS WHICH WAS MUCH PREFERABLE TO SPIRITS AS IT GAVE THEM STRENGTH WITHOUT INTOXICATION DURING THIS TRYING OCCASION THE MEN BEHAVED WITH THE UTMOST INTREPIDITY AND OBEDIENCE
ONE OF THE MEN AND THE WOMAN FLED INTO THE WOODS BUT WERE SOON TAKEN THEY CONFESSED THEY WERE ENGLISH CONVICTS AND THAT THEY HAD MADE THEIR ESCAPE FROM BOTANY BAY THEY HAD BEEN SUPPLIED WITH A QUADRANT A COMPASS A CHART
WAS PERFORMED BY HIS DRINKING A BUMPER OF BRANDY AND GUNPOWDER STIRRED ROUND WITH THE POINT OF A SWORD AFTER BEING INVESTED WITH THE REGAL DIGNITY HE CAME DOWN IN STATE TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO THE GOVERNOR
THE TOWN IS REGULAR AND BEAUTIFUL AND THE HOUSES ARE BUILT IN A STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE WHICH HAS GIVEN LOOSE TO THE MOST SPORTIVE FANCY EACH STREET IS TERMINATED WITH SOME PUBLIC BUILDING SUCH AS A GREAT MARINE SCHOOL
HAD BEEN THROWN INTO THE BOAT THE HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE REFLECTION FROM THE SAND WAS NOW EXCRUCIATING AND OUR STOMACHS BEING FILLED WITH SALT WATER FROM THE GREAT LENGTH OF TIME WE WERE SWIMMING BEFORE WE WERE PICKED UP
ON THE TWENTY FIRST WE GOT THROUGH ALICE
WHEN I TELL THEM PROFESSIONALLY THAT ALL THE MORTALITY OF THAT PLACE ORIGINATES FROM MARSH EFFLUVIA ARISING FROM THEIR STAGNANT CANALS AND PLEASURE GROUNDS
TO WHICH WE GAVE NO PARTICULAR NAME AND TWO MORE ISLANDS TO THE WESTWARD CALLED BICKERTON'S ISLANDS INCLUDING TWO SMALL ISLANDS NEAR THE ABOVE
WAS COMPOSED OF VERY LARGE STONES AND CALLED IT STONY REEF ISLAND
IN PASSING THE ISLAND OF FLORES A MOST TREMENDOUS STORM AROSE IN A FEW MINUTES EVERY SAIL OF THE SHIP WAS SHIVERED TO PIECES
MAY BE CALLED MOUNTAINS THEY ARE CULTIVATED TO THE TOP THE REASON OF WHICH I PRESUME
AND A MOUNTAIN BETWEEN THEM WE NAMED MOUNT CLARENCE AFTER PASSING CAPE HOOD THE LAND APPEARS LOWER AND TO TRENCH AWAY ABOUT NORTH WEST FORMING A DEEP BAY AND IT MAY BE DOUBTED
THE SCHEME OF THE TOPSAIL WAS NOW LAID ASIDE AND EVERY SOUL FELL TO BALING AND PUMPING ALL THE BOATS EXCEPTING ONE
AS THE OCCURRENCES AT THIS TIME BORE SOME SEMBLANCE TO THE TRANSACTIONS IN OUR LAST VISIT TO AVOID WOUNDING THE DELICATE OR SATIATING THE LICENTIOUS WE SHALL CONCLUDE
GOT SOME PROVISIONS HERE BUT FOUND THE WATER BRACKISH ON THE TWENTY NINTH WE ANCHORED AGAIN IN THE ROAD OF ANAMOOKA WE WERE SORRY TO HEAR THE TENDER HAD NOT BEEN THERE ON THE FIFTH OF AUGUST WE AGAIN PROCEEDED ON OUR VOYAGE
FOR STAGNANT MUD THAN FROM CLIMATE
THE DUTCH SEAMEN WERE STRUCK WITH HORROR AND WENT BELOW AND THE SHIP WAS PRESERVED FROM DESTRUCTION BY THE MANLY EXERTION OF OUR ENGLISH TARS
THE LEAK GAINING FAST UPON US AND SHE WAS DRIVING DOWN
DURING OUR FIVE WEEKS STAY HERE THE GOVERNOR MYNHEER VANION BY EVERY ACT OF POLITENESS AND ATTENTION ENDEAVOURED TO MAKE US SPEND OUR TIME AGREEABLY WE WERE SUMPTUOUSLY REGALED AT HIS TABLE EVERY DAY
AND A NUMBER OF VENOMOUS REPTILES WITH WHICH THIS COUNTRY ABOUNDS THERE IS ONE IN PARTICULAR CALLED THE COWK COWK IT IS THE MOST DISGUSTING LOOKING ANIMAL THAT CREEPS THE GROUND AND ITS BITE IS MORTAL
IN THE NIGHT WE WERE DISTURBED BY THE IRREGULAR BEHAVIOUR OF ONE CONNELL WHICH LED US TO SUSPECT HE HAD STOLE OUR WINE AND GOT DRUNK BUT ON FURTHER INQUIRY WE FOUND THAT THE EXCRUCIATING TORTURE HE SUFFERED FROM THIRST
STANDARDS AND STANDARD BEARERS WERE PRESENT WHEN THE CORPSE
PART OF THE CREW AND PASSENGERS OF AN ENGLISH BRIG WRECKED IN THESE SEAS HIS HOUSE WHICH HAS EVER BEEN THE ASYLUM
AND THE EVENING WAS SPENT WITH CARDS AND CONCERTS I COULD DWELL WITH PLEASURE FOR AN AGE IN PRAISE OF THIS HONEST DUTCHMAN IT IS THE TRIBUTE OF A GRATEFUL HEART AND HIS DUE THIS IS THE THIRD TIME
IS WAX HONEY AND SANDLEWOOD BUT THE WHOLE OF ITS REVENUES DO NOT DEFRAY THE EXPENCE OF THE SETTLEMENT TO THE COMPANY BUT FROM THE LOCALITY OF ITS SITUATION IT IS CONVENIENT FOR THEIR OTHER ISLANDS
BY WHICH MEANS HE WENT MAD AND DIED IN THE SEQUEL OF THE VOYAGE NEXT MORNING MISTER GEORGE PASSMORE THE MASTER WAS DISPATCHED IN ONE OF THE BOATS TO VISIT THE WRECK TO SEE IF ANY THING FLOATED ROUND HER
WHICH PROMISES BETTER ANCHORAGE THAN ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE FRIENDLY ISLES THE NATIVES TOLD US THERE WERE EXCELLENT WATERING PLACES IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTS WITHIN THE SOUND
WE VIEWED THE RELICS OF LORD CATHCART WE MET NOTHING PARTICULAR IN PASSING THE ISLAND OF SUMATRA BUT EXPERIENCED GREAT DEATH AND SICKNESS IN GOING THROUGH THE STRAITS OF SUNDA
ARRIVED AT THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE HERE WE MET WITH MANY CIVILITIES FROM COLONEL GORDON A GENTLEMAN NO LESS EMINENT FOR HIS PRIVATE VIRTUES THAN HIS EXTRAORDINARY MILITARY AND LITERARY ACCOMPLISHMENTS FROM HIS LABOURS
EAST INDIAMAN WHO SPOKE ENGLISH HEARING OF THE ARRIVAL OF CAPTAIN EDWARDS AND OUR UNFORTUNATE BOAT RUN TO THEM WITH THE GLAD TIDINGS OF THEIR CAPTAIN HAVING ARRIVED BUT ONE OF THEM STARTING UP IN SURPRISE SAID
WAS OPEN FOR THEIR RECEPTION THEY DREW BILLS ON THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT AND WERE SUPPLIED WITH EVERY NECESSARY THEY STOOD IN NEED OF THE CAPTAIN OF A DUTCH
THIS IS THE MONTPELIER OF THE EAST TO THE DUTCH AND PORTUGUESE SETTLEMENTS IN INDIA AND FROM THE SALUBRITY OF ITS AIR IS THE FAVOURITE RESORT OF VALETUDINARIANS AND INVALIDS FROM BATAVIA AND OTHER PLACES
THE COMMANDING OFFICER WHO HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO SHOOT HIM ON NOT FINDING THE SHIP NEXT DAY THEY GAVE UP ALL FURTHER HOPES OF HER AND STEERED FOR ANAMOOKA THE RENDEZVOUS CAPTAIN EDWARDS HAD APPOINTED
OR ONE OF THE SUPREME COUNCIL MEETS A CARRIAGE THE GENTLEMAN WHO MEETS HIM MUST ALIGHT AND MAKE HIM A PERFECT BOW IN SPIRIT NOT ONE OF BUNBURRY'S LONG BOWS BUT THAT BOW
THE IMPETUOSITY IMAGINABLE ON A SAVAGE SHORE ABOUT SEVEN MILES
IT IS NOT THE CLIMATE I AM INVEIGHING AGAINST IT IS THE GOTHIC DIABOLICAL IDEAS OF THE PEOPLE I INDITE WERE THEY ONLY DUTCHMEN WHO SUPPLIED THE RAVENOUS MAW OF DEATH IT WOULD BE
IN THIS VOYAGE IN MANY PLACES OF THE COAST OF SOUTH WALES THEY FOUND VERY GOOD COAL A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WAS NOT BEFORE KNOWN OUR MEN WERE NOW BEGINNING TO REGAIN THEIR STRENGTH
NEXT DAY WE SAW THE ISLAND OF MADURA ON THE TWENTY SIXTH SAW THE ISLAND OF JAVA AND ON THE THIRTIETH ANCHORED AT SAMARANG IMMEDIATELY ON OUR COMING TO ANCHOR
WE WERE NOW CONVINCED THAT WE WERE FURTHER TO THE WESTWARD THAN WE IMAGINED AND THEREFORE SHAPED A COURSE TO FALL IN TO THE EASTWARD OF WALLIS'S ISLAND AND NEXT DAY FELL IN WITH IT
THE FIRST TOAST AFTER DINNER WAS THE DEAD KING'S HEALTH NEXT THEY DRANK MYNHEER COMPANY'S HEALTH WHICH WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH A VOLLEY OF SMALL ARMS AND PATERREROS
HAVING REPRESENTED THIS PART OF THE OCEAN AS EXCEEDINGLY DANGEROUS AND IT CERTAINLY IS THE BOLDEST PIECE OF NAVIGATION
GAVE HIM UP AS A SLAVE
THEY WERE HOWEVER PERFECTLY IGNORANT OF FIRE ARMS AND SEEMED MUCH STARTLED AT THE REPORT OF A MUSKET WERE TOO SHY TO STAND THE EXPERIMENT OF A GREAT GUN AS THEY CAME OFF WITH HOSTILE INTENTIONS THEY BROUGHT NO WOMEN WITH THEM
WHICH BEING COPPER WE CUT UP AND CONVERTED INTO NAILS FOR FITTING OUT THE BOATS SOME OF THE GIGANTIC COCKLE WAS BOILED AND CUT INTO JUNKS
AND THE GLOOMY HORRORS OF DEATH
RELATES A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAPPENED TO HIM WHILE HUNTING IN CROSSING A SHALLOW PART OF THE RIVER HIS BLACK BOY WAS SNAPPED UP BY AN ALLIGATOR BUT THE GOVERNOR IMMEDIATELY DISMOUNTED RESCUED THE BOY OUT OF HIS MOUTH
TWO SMALL WINE GLASSES OF WATER A DAY TO EACH MAN FOR SIXTEEN DAYS A SAW AND HAMMER HAD FORTUNATELY BEEN IN ONE OF THE BOATS WHICH ENABLED US WITH THE GREATER EXPEDITION TO MAKE
TO THE SOUTHWARD STOOD TO THE WESTWARD WHERE THERE APPEARED TO BE AN OPENING WE SAW AN ISLAND IN THAT DIRECTION AND A REEF EXTENDING A CONSIDERABLE WAY TO THE NORTH WEST
WHETHER IT JOINS NEW GUINEA OR NOT WE PURSUED OUR COURSE TO THE WESTWARD KEEPING ENDEAVOUR STRAITS OPEN BY WHICH MEANS WE HOPED TO AVOID THE DANGERS CAPTAIN COOK MET WITH IN HIGHER LATITUDES
HE HAS HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXTENDING HIS HOSPITALITY TO SHIPWRECKED ENGLISHMEN ABOUT A FORTNIGHT BEFORE WE ARRIVED A BOAT WITH EIGHT MEN A WOMAN AND TWO CHILDREN CAME ON SHORE HERE WHO TOLD HIM
HAS A MOST BARREN ASPECT THERE WERE EVIDENT MARKS OF VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS HAVING HAPPENED THE VERY SINGULAR APPEARANCE WHICH THIS PART OF THE ISLAND PRESENTED I CANNOT OMIT MENTIONING IT BORE THE FIGURE OF A PIECE OF FLAT TABLE LAND
THE ALLIGATORS ARE DARING AND NUMEROUS THERE ARE INSTANCES OF THEIR DEVOURING MEN AND CHILDREN WHEN BATHING IN THE SHALLOW PART OF THE RIVER ABOVE THE TOWN THE GOVERNOR MYNHEER VANION
HAS NOT BEEN NEGLECTED AND THOSE OBJECTS OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE ARE PLACED IN A PROPER POINT OF VIEW AS THE JUST PRIDE AND ORNAMENT OF A GREAT COMMERCIAL PEOPLE SUCH IS THE EFFECT OF EARLY PREJUDICES THAT UNDER THE MUZLE OF THE SUN
BUT BEFORE THE TACKS WERE HAULED ON BOARD AND THE SAILS TRIMMED
AND AS SOON AS THEY MAKE THEIR FORTUNE THEY GO HOME LET THE AMATEURS OF THE REPUBLICAN SYSTEM READ AND LEARN BE NOT SURPRISED
THAT THE TRANSCENDENT WORTH OF A BRITISH SEAMAN IS MOST CONSPICUOUS NOR WOULD I WISH
BY THE NATIVES ALL REMARKABLE FOR THE RICHNESS AND VARIETY OF THEIR PLUMAGE THE GROUP OF ISLANDS WAS CALLED HOWE'S ISLANDS BUT WERE PARTICULARLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE NAMES OF BARRINGTON'S SAWYER'S HOTHAM'S AND JARVIS'S ISLANDS
TO WHICH THE NAME OF MURRAY'S ISLANDS WAS GIVEN
TAKING WITH US THE PRISONERS AND CONVICTS
IT HAD LATELY BEEN OUR CUSTOM TO LAY TO IN THE NIGHT
PROW VESSELS WHO ARE A VERY DARING SET OF PIRATES THAT INFEST THOSE SEAS ON THE TWENTY SECOND
TO GET READY TO DISCOVER IF THERE WAS A PASSAGE FOR THE SHIP
THEY HAVE A GOVERNOR OF THEIR OWN NATION BUT PAY LARGE TRIBUTE TO THE DUTCH NOTWITHSTANDING THEIR TRADE IS UNDER VERY SEVERE RESTRICTIONS THEY SOON MAKE RICH AND AS SOON AS THEY BECOME INDEPENDENT RETURN TO THEIR OWN COUNTRY
THOSE VILE HAWKERS OF SPICE AND NUTMEGS EXACT A SUBMISSION THAT THE MOST ABSOLUTE AND TYRANNICAL MONARCH
THAT IN A YEAR OR TWO THIS BEAUTIFUL TOWN WILL BE COMPLETELY DAMMED IN A FEW DAYS WE ARRIVED AT BATAVIA THE EMPOREUM OF THE DUTCH IN THE EAST AND OUR FIRST CARE WAS EMPLOYED IN SENDING TO THE HOSPITAL
WERE DISTINCTLY SEEN BY US SHE WAS REASONABLY SOON EXPECTED ON BOARD WE NOW SOUNDED BUT HAD NO BOTTOM WITH A HUNDRED AND TEN FATHOM LINE TILL PAST SEVEN O'CLOCK WHEN WE GOT GROUND IN FIFTY FATHOM
AND ALTHOUGH FIVE OF THE STOUTEST MEN IN THE SHIP WERE HANGING UPON HIM
WE FELT MORE INTERESTED IN THE FATE OF THIS POOR WRETCH ON ACCOUNT OF HIS HAVING BEEN A PRINCE HIMSELF
ALTHOUGH THEY KEPT A STRICT GUARD OVER THEM NOTHING WAS WITHHELD TO RENDER THEIR SITUATION AGREEABLE AND THEY WERE SENT
WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL KING LEST THEY SHOULD NOT BE INCLINED TO PAY THAT SUBMISSION TO A COMPANY OF MERCHANTS THE INAUGURAL CEREMONY AT THE INSTALLATION OF THE YOUNG KING
AND WHEN THE ALARM IS GIVEN BY THE PIQUET GUARD
A REGIMENT OF THE DUKE OF WIRTEMBURG IS DOING DUTY HERE AMONGST WHOM WERE SEVERAL MEN OF RANK AND FASHION WHO SHEWED US
IT IS ABOUT SEVEN MILES LONG AND BEING A NEW DISCOVERY WE CALLED IT GRENVILLE'S ISLAND IN HONOUR OF LORD GRENVILLE THE NAME THE NATIVES GAVE IT IS ROTUMAH THEY CAME OFF IN A FLEET OF CANOES RESTED ON THEIR PADDLES
AND CAPTAIN DADLEBERG OF THE REMBANG INDIAMAN WAS MAKING EVERY POSSIBLE DISPATCH WITH HIS SHIP TO CARRY US TO BATAVIA DURING THIS TIME THE INTERMENT OF BALTHAZAR
TO THIS MINUTE THE MEN NEVER SWERVED FROM THEIR DUTY SHE NOW TOOK A VERY HEAVY HEEL
BUT WISHING TO BE WELL INFORMED IN SO INTRICATE A BUSINESS AND THE DAY BEING FAR SPENT WE WAITED THE BOATS COMING ON BOARD
THEY HAVE EVEN CONTRIVED TO CARRY CANALS TO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN THE BOORS OR COUNTRY FARMERS ARE A SPECIES OF THE HUMAN RACE
IN THE TORPID PHRASEOLOGY OF THE LOG WITH DITTO REPEATED
WHILST HE WAS FORGING BOLTS AND FETTERS FOR OUR PRISONERS AND CONVICTS HERE THE SUNSHINE OF PROSPERITY AND THE MUTABILITY OF HUMAN GREATNESS WERE EXCELLENTLY POURTRAYED
HAS THE HAPPINESS TO JOIN
THE TOWN IS GAY AND FROM LENGTH OF HABIT THE INHABITANTS PARTAKE
WHICH IS USED IN ALL TEMPLES MOSQUES AND PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE EAST EVERY CHINESE HAVING A SPRIG OF IT BURNING DAY AND NIGHT NEAR THEIR HOUSEHOLD GODS THE EXCLUSIVE TRADE OF SANDLEWOOD
RUN DOWN TO LEEWARD WHICH CRUSHED ONE MAN TO DEATH ABOUT THE SAME TIME A SPARE TOPMAST CAME DOWN FROM THE BOOMS AND KILLED ANOTHER MAN THE PEOPLE NOW BECAME FAINT
BY THE SMALLNESS OF THE WINDOWS
BEFORE HE LEFT US IT WAS JUDGED NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD TAKE WITH HIM AN AXE SOME FUEL PROVISIONS A LITTLE WATER AND A COMPASS PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE IT WAS NOW THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF AUGUST
ON THE NORTH WEST SIDE OF GARDNER'S ISLAND ALL THIS PART
AND CONSCIENCE ASK A CURIOUS SORT OF QUESTION ABOUT THE RIGHT DIVINE HOW FAR WE SHOULD SELL FLESH AND BLOOD WHEN DINNER HAS OPPREST ONE I THINK IT IS PERHAPS THE GLOOMIEST HOUR WHICH TURNS UP OUT OF THE SAD TWENTY FOUR
AND IN HER LARGE EYES WROUGHT A MIXTURE OF SENSATIONS MIGHT BE SCANN'D OF HALF VOLUPTUOUSNESS AND HALF COMMAND HER FORM HAD ALL THE SOFTNESS OF HER SEX
I GAZED AS OFT I HAVE GAZED THE SAME TO TRY IF I COULD WRENCH AUGHT OUT OF DEATH WHICH SHOULD CONFIRM OR SHAKE OR MAKE A FAITH BUT IT WAS ALL A MYSTERY
METHINKS SAID HE IT WOULD BE NO GREAT SHAME IF WE SHOULD STRIKE A STROKE TO SET US FREE LET S KNOCK THAT OLD BLACK FELLOW ON THE HEAD AND MARCH AWAY
THANK HEAVEN NOT MINE TO HEAR AND TO OBEY HAD BEEN FROM BIRTH THE LAW OF ALL AROUND HER TO FULFILL ALL PHANTASIES WHICH YIELDED JOY OR MIRTH HAD BEEN HER SLAVES CHIEF PLEASURE AS HER WILL
SOME FAINT LAMPS GLEAMING FROM THE LOFTY WALLS GAVE LIGHT ENOUGH TO HINT THEIR FARTHER WAY BUT NOT ENOUGH TO SHOW THE IMPERIAL HALLS IN ALL THE FLASHING OF THEIR FULL ARRAY
THEY MIGHT MAKE SIX AND TWENTY SPRINGS BUT THERE ARE FORMS WHICH TIME TO TOUCH FORBEARS AND TURNS ASIDE HIS SCYTHE TO VULGAR THINGS SUCH AS WAS MARY'S QUEEN OF SCOTS
HE STOOD LIKE ATLAS WITH A WORLD OF WORDS ABOUT HIS EARS AND NATHLESS WOULD NOT BEND THE BLOOD OF ALL HIS LINE S CASTILIAN LORDS BOIL'D IN HIS VEINS AND RATHER THAN DESCEND TO STAIN HIS PEDIGREE
ALL RAGAMUFFINS DIFFERING BUT IN HUE WITH WHOM IT IS OUR LUCK TO CAST OUR LOT
BECAUSE IF DROWN'D THEY CAN'T IF SPARED THEY WON'T
BUT HUGE HOUSES FIT ILL AND HUGE TOMBS WORSE MANKIND SINCE ADAM FELL METHINKS THE STORY OF THE TOWER OF BABEL MIGHT TEACH THEM THIS MUCH BETTER THAN I M ABLE BABEL WAS NIMROD'S HUNTING BOX
BABA PROPOSED THAT HE SHOULD KISS THE HAND HERE WAS AN HONOURABLE COMPROMISE A HALF WAY HOUSE OF DIPLOMATIC REST WHERE THEY MIGHT MEET IN MUCH MORE PEACEFUL GUISE
THE BLACK HOWEVER WITHOUT HARDLY DEIGNING A GLANCE AT THAT WHICH WRAPT THE SLAVES IN WONDER TRAMPLED WHAT THEY SCARCE TROD FOR FEAR OF STAINING AS IF THE MILKY WAY THEIR FEET WAS UNDER WITH ALL ITS STARS
AND HORRID WAS THE CONTRAST TO THE VIEW BUT LET ME QUIT THE THEME AS SUCH THINGS CLAIM PERHAPS EVEN MORE ATTENTION THAN IS DUE FROM ME
A THOUSAND SWORDS A THOUSAND TIMES OF HIM HAD MADE AN END
NOW I HAVE ANSWER'D ALL YOUR QUESTIONS WITHOUT PRESSING AND YOU AN EQUAL COURTESY SHOULD SHOW
MAKES US FEEL OUR MORTALITY IN FACT REDOUBLED
OLD BLACK EUNUCH SEEMS TO EYE US
THE MOST BY READY CASH BUT ALL HAVE PRICES FROM CROWNS TO KICKS ACCORDING TO THEIR VICES THE EUNUCH
BE SO GOOD AS DRESS YOURSELF AND POINTED OUT A SUIT IN WHICH A PRINCESS WITH GREAT PLEASURE WOULD ARRAY HER LIMBS
AMBITION AVARICE VENGEANCE GLORY GLUE THE GLITTERING LIME TWIGS OF OUR LATTER DAYS WHERE STILL WE FLUTTER ON FOR PENCE OR PRAISE
GAVE IT A SLIGHT KICK WITH HIS CHRISTIAN FOOT AND WHEN THE OLD NEGRO TOLD HIM TO GET READY REPLIED OLD GENTLEMAN I M NOT A LADY
THIS IS A FACT AND NO POETIC FABLE JUST AS MY GREAT COAT WAS ABOUT ME CAST MY HAT AND GLOVES STILL LYING ON THE TABLE I HEARD A SHOT
AND RAPTURE'S SELF WILL SEEM ALMOST A PAIN WITH AUGHT WHICH LOOKS LIKE DESPOTISM IN VIEW OUR SOULS AT LEAST ARE FREE AND T IS IN VAIN WE WOULD AGAINST THEM MAKE THE FLESH OBEY
AND IT MIGHT BE FROM THOUGHT OR TOIL OR STUDY AN OPEN BROW A LITTLE MARK'D WITH CARE ONE ARM HAD ON A BANDAGE RATHER BLOODY
FIRST BUT FOR ONE AND AFTER FOR THE PAIR THEY HAGGLED WRANGLED SWORE TOO SO THEY DID
A NEAT SNUG STUDY ON A WINTER'S NIGHT
FORM'D RATHER FOR INSTRUCTING THAN DELIGHTING AND WITH ALL PASSIONS IN THEIR TURN ATTACK'D NOW IF MY PEGASUS SHOULD NOT BE SHOD ILL THIS POEM WILL BECOME A MORAL MODEL
HE SOON BEGAN TO SHOW A KIND OF BLUNT COMPASSION FOR THE SAD LOT OF SO YOUNG A PARTNER IN THE WOE WHICH FOR HIMSELF HE SEEM'D TO DEEM NO WORSE THAN ANY OTHER SCRAPE A THING OF COURSE
WHAT THE DEVIL SHALL I DO WITH ALL THIS GAUZE THUS HE PROFANELY TERM'D THE FINEST LACE WHICH E'ER SET OFF A MARRIAGE MORNING FACE
SHE HAS SERVED ME ALSO MUCH THE SAME AS YOU EXCEPT THAT I HAVE FOUND IT NOTHING NEW
HER BLOOD WAS HIGH HER BEAUTY SCARCE OF EARTH JUDGE THEN IF HER CAPRICES E'ER STOOD STILL
IT CHANCED AMONGST THE OTHER PEOPLE LOTTED A MAN OF THIRTY RATHER STOUT AND HALE WITH RESOLUTION IN HIS DARK
I PASS MY EVENINGS IN LONG GALLERIES SOLELY AND THAT S THE REASON I M SO MELANCHOLY ALAS MAN MAKES THAT GREAT WHICH MAKES HIM LITTLE
FOR HIS OWN SHARE HE SAW BUT SMALL OBJECTION TO SO RESPECTABLE AN ANCIENT RITE AND AFTER SWALLOWING DOWN A SLIGHT REFECTION FOR WHICH HE OWN'D A PRESENT APPETITE
I THEREFORE DO DENOUNCE ALL AMOROUS WRITING EXCEPT IN SUCH A WAY AS NOT TO ATTRACT PLAIN SIMPLE SHORT AND BY NO MEANS INVITING BUT WITH A MORAL TO EACH ERROR TACK'D
PLAIN TRUTH DEAR MURRAY NEEDS FEW FLOWERS OF SPEECH TO MAKE MEN HAPPY OR TO KEEP THEM SO SO TAKE IT IN THE VERY WORDS OF CREECH
WELL THEN YOUR THIRD
ALL FEELINGS CHANGED BUT THIS WAS LAST TO VARY A SPELL FROM WHICH EVEN YET I AM NOT QUITE FREE BUT I GROW SAD AND LET A TALE GROW COLD WHICH MUST NOT BE PATHETICALLY TOLD
AND IS THIS BLOOD THEN FORM'D BUT TO BE SHED CAN EVERY ELEMENT OUR ELEMENTS MARCH AND AIR EARTH WATER FIRE LIVE AND WE DEAD
IT WOULD STRIKE YOU BLIND COULD I DO JUSTICE TO THE FULL DETAIL SO LUCKILY FOR BOTH MY PHRASES FAIL THUS MUCH HOWEVER I MAY ADD HER YEARS WERE RIPE
AND THERE HE STOOD WITH SUCH SANG FROID THAT GREATER COULD SCARCE BE SHOWN EVEN BY A MERE SPECTATOR
MUCH FITTED FOR INSPIRING MARVEL AND PRAISE FOR BOTH OR NONE THINGS WIN AND I MUST SAY I NE'ER COULD SEE THE VERY GREAT HAPPINESS OF THE NIL ADMIRARI NOT TO ADMIRE IS ALL THE ART I KNOW
LIKE A BACKGAMMON BOARD THE PLACE WAS DOTTED WITH WHITES AND BLACKS IN GROUPS ON SHOW FOR SALE THOUGH RATHER MORE IRREGULARLY SPOTTED SOME BOUGHT THE JET WHILE OTHERS CHOSE THE PALE
THOUGH ON MORE THOROUGH BRED OR FAIRER FINGERS NO LIPS E'ER LEFT THEIR TRANSITORY TRACE ON SUCH AS THESE THE LIP TOO FONDLY LINGERS AND FOR ONE KISS WOULD FAIN IMPRINT A BRACE
A SINGLE CRY WOULD BRING THEM ALL ABROAD T IS THEREFORE BETTER LOOKING BEFORE LEAPING
BUT YESTERDAY AND WHO HAD MIGHTIER BREATH A THOUSAND WARRIORS BY HIS WORD WERE KEPT IN AWE HE SAID AS THE CENTURION SAITH GO AND HE GOETH COME AND FORTH HE STEPP'D
NO METHOD S MORE SURE AT MOMENTS TO TAKE HOLD OF THE BEST FEELINGS OF MANKIND
THEY LITTLE THINK WHAT MISCHIEF IS IN HAND THE GREATER THEIR SUCCESS THE WORSE IT PROVES AS OVID'S VERSE MAY GIVE TO UNDERSTAND EVEN PETRARCH'S SELF IF JUDGED WITH DUE SEVERITY IS THE PLATONIC PIMP OF ALL POSTERITY
AND RUNNING OUT AS FAST AS I WAS ABLE I FOUND THE MILITARY COMMANDANT STRETCH'D IN THE STREET
WHOSE USE DEPENDS SO MUCH UPON THE GASTRIC JUICE THE OTHER EVENING
AT LAST THEY REACH'D A QUARTER MOST RETIRED WHERE ECHO WOKE AS IF FROM A LONG SLUMBER
KING OF MEN REIGN'D TILL ONE SUMMER'S DAY HE TOOK TO GRAZING AND DANIEL TAMED THE LIONS IN THEIR DEN THE PEOPLE'S AWE AND ADMIRATION RAISING
ALL SAVE THE BLACKS SEEM'D JADED WITH VEXATION FROM FRIENDS AND HOME AND FREEDOM FAR ESTRANGED THE NEGROES MORE PHILOSOPHY DISPLAY'D USED TO IT NO DOUBT
WE KNOW WHERE THINGS AND MEN MUST END AT BEST A MORAL LIKE ALL MORALS MELANCHOLY
THE FOREMOST IN THE CHARGE OR IN THE SALLY SHOULD NOW BE BUTCHER'D IN A CIVIC ALLEY THE SCARS OF HIS OLD WOUNDS WERE NEAR HIS NEW THOSE HONOURABLE SCARS WHICH BROUGHT HIM FAME
HE REPLIED I THOUGHT IN FACT YOU COULD NOT BE A GREEK THOSE SERVILE DOGS ARE NOT SO PROUDLY EYED FORTUNE HAS PLAY'D YOU HERE A PRETTY FREAK
AND THESE ARE THINGS WHICH ASK A TENDER TEAR SUCH AS I TOO WOULD SHED IF IN YOUR PLACE I CRIED UPON MY FIRST WIFE'S DYING DAY AND ALSO WHEN MY SECOND RAN AWAY
AND WEIGHING OTHERS IN THEIR HAND AND BY MISTAKE SEQUINS WITH PARAS JUMBLING UNTIL THE SUM WAS ACCURATELY SCANN'D AND THEN THE MERCHANT GIVING CHANGE AND SIGNING RECEIPTS IN FULL BEGAN TO THINK OF DINING
THUS HORACE WROTE WE ALL KNOW LONG AGO AND THUS POPE QUOTES THE PRECEPT TO RE TEACH FROM HIS TRANSLATION BUT HAD NONE ADMIRED WOULD POPE HAVE SUNG OR HORACE BEEN INSPIRED BABA
OVERPOWERING KNELL THE TOCSIN OF THE SOUL THE DINNER BELL TURKEY CONTAINS NO BELLS AND YET MEN DINE
TO STRIVE TOO WITH OUR FATE WERE SUCH A STRIFE AS IF THE CORN SHEAF SHOULD OPPOSE THE SICKLE MEN ARE THE SPORT OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES SEEM THE SPORT OF MEN
BUT NEVER MIND
IF I MAY PRESUME WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE
SWALLOWING A HEART BURNING SIGH HEAVEN HELP THE SCHOLAR WHOM HIS FORTUNE SENDS HERE PERHAPS WE SHALL BE ONE DAY BY AND BY REJOIN'D THE OTHER WHEN OUR BAD LUCK MENDS HERE MEANTIME YON
TILL SOME MIGHT CHOOSE TO BUY HE HAD AN ENGLISH LOOK THAT IS WAS SQUARE IN MAKE OF A COMPLEXION WHITE AND RUDDY GOOD TEETH WITH CURLING RATHER DARK BROWN HAIR
THEY LOOK'D LIKE PERSONS BEING LED TO SENTENCE WONDERING WHAT NEXT
I NEITHER KNOW NOR CARE SAID BABA BUT PRAY DO AS I DESIRE I HAVE NO MORE TIME NOR MANY WORDS TO SPARE AT LEAST
AND LOOKING ON HIM WITH A SORT OF SMILE TOOK LEAVE WITH SUCH A FACE OF SATISFACTION AS GOOD MEN WEAR WHO HAVE DONE A VIRTUOUS ACTION WHEN HE WAS GONE THERE WAS A SUDDEN CHANGE
OTHERS SLEPT AND SOME PREPARED FOR SUPPER WITH A GLASS OF RUM AS THE BLACK EUNUCH ENTER'D WITH HIS BRACE OF PURCHASED INFIDELS SOME RAISED THEIR EYES A MOMENT WITHOUT SLACKENING FROM THEIR PACE
HERE WE ARE AND THERE WE GO BUT WHERE
THE CHARMING MARY MONTAGU I HAVE A PASSION FOR THE NAME OF MARY FOR ONCE IT WAS A MAGIC SOUND TO ME AND STILL IT HALF CALLS UP THE REALMS OF FAIRY WHERE I BEHELD WHAT NEVER WAS TO BE
THOUGH MY SOUL LOATHES THE EFFEMINATE GARB
APPALS BUT SADDENS MORE BY NIGHT AS WELL AS DAY THAN AN ENORMOUS ROOM WITHOUT A SOUL TO BREAK THE LIFELESS SPLENDOUR OF THE WHOLE TWO OR THREE SEEM SO LITTLE
AND THE CALUMNIATED QUEEN SEMIRAMIS THAT INJURED QUEEN BY CHRONICLERS SO COARSE HAS BEEN ACCUSED I DOUBT NOT BY CONSPIRACY OF AN IMPROPER FRIENDSHIP FOR HER HORSE
SOME BY FEATURES ARE BOUGHT UP OTHERS BY A WARLIKE LEADER
I GAZED UPON HIM FOR I KNEW HIM WELL AND THOUGH I HAVE SEEN MANY CORPSES NEVER SAW ONE WHOM SUCH AN ACCIDENT BEFELL SO CALM
T IS BAD AND MAY BE BETTER ALL MEN'S LOT MOST MEN ARE SLAVES NONE MORE SO THAN THE GREAT TO THEIR OWN WHIMS AND PASSIONS AND WHAT NOT
OF FOOD I THINK WITH PHILIP'S SON OR RATHER AMMON'S ILL PLEASED WITH ONE WORLD AND ONE FATHER I THINK WITH ALEXANDER THAT THE ACT OF EATING WITH ANOTHER ACT OR TWO
YET I MUST OWN HE LOOKED A LITTLE DULL AND NOW AND THEN A TEAR STOLE DOWN BY STEALTH PERHAPS HIS RECENT LOSS OF BLOOD MIGHT PULL HIS SPIRIT DOWN AND THEN THE LOSS OF WEALTH A MISTRESS
THE TRUMP AND BUGLE TILL HE SPAKE WERE DUMB
WHICH TO THE KNEE MIGHT REACH AND TROUSERS NOT SO TIGHT THAT THEY WOULD BURST BUT SUCH AS FIT AN ASIATIC BREECH A SHAWL WHOSE FOLDS IN CASHMIRE HAD BEEN NURST SLIPPERS OF SAFFRON DAGGER RICH AND HANDY IN SHORT
BUT THOSE WHO SATE NE'ER STIRR'D IN ANYWISE ONE OR TWO STARED THE CAPTIVES IN THE FACE JUST AS ONE VIEWS A HORSE TO GUESS HIS PRICE SOME NODDED TO THE NEGRO FROM THEIR STATION BUT
SOME TALK OF AN APPEAL UNTO SOME PASSION SOME TO MEN'S FEELINGS OTHERS TO THEIR REASON THE LAST OF THESE WAS NEVER MUCH THE FASHION FOR REASON THINKS ALL REASONING OUT OF SEASON
HIS FRIEND TOO ADDING A NEW SAVING CLAUSE SAID IN HEAVEN'S NAME LET'S GET SOME SUPPER NOW
AND YOU WILL FIND US NOT TOP FOND OF JOKING
I THOUGHT OR SAID CAN THIS BE DEATH THEN WHAT IS LIFE OR DEATH SPEAK BUT HE SPOKE NOT WAKE BUT STILL HE SLEPT
PRAY WHAT IS YOUR NATION
YET SOMEHOW THERE WAS SOMETHING SOMEWHERE WANTING AS IF SHE RATHER ORDER'D THAN WAS GRANTING
DESCRIPTION IS MY FORTE BUT EVERY FOOL DESCRIBES IN THESE BRIGHT DAYS HIS WONDROUS JOURNEY TO SOME FOREIGN COURT AND SPAWNS HIS QUARTO AND DEMANDS YOUR PRAISE DEATH TO HIS PUBLISHER TO HIM T IS SPORT
SOCIETY ITSELF WHICH SHOULD CREATE KINDNESS DESTROYS WHAT LITTLE WE HAD GOT
SAVE IN ONE WHERE DROPPING A MARBLE FOUNTAIN ECHOES THROUGH THE GLOOMS OF NIGHT WHICH ROBE THE CHAMBER OR WHERE POPPING SOME FEMALE HEAD MOST CURIOUSLY PRESUMES TO THRUST ITS BLACK EYES THROUGH THE DOOR OR LATTICE
POOR FELLOW FOR SOME REASON SURELY BAD THEY HAD SLAIN HIM WITH FIVE SLUGS AND LEFT HIM THERE TO PERISH ON THE PAVEMENT
JUST NOW A BLACK OLD NEUTRAL PERSONAGE OF THE THIRD SEX STEPT UP AND PEERING OVER THE CAPTIVES SEEM'D TO MARK THEIR LOOKS AND AGE AND CAPABILITIES
BUT BABA STROKING THE THINGS DOWN SAID
TURNS UP MORE DANGEROUS BREAKERS THAN THE EUXINE
BUT HE COULD NOT STOOP TO ANY SHOE UNLESS IT SHOD THE POPE
OTHERS IN MONOSYLLABLE TALK CHATTED AND SOME SEEM'D MUCH IN LOVE WITH THEIR OWN DRESS AND DIVERS SMOKED SUPERB PIPES DECORATED WITH AMBER MOUTHS OF GREATER PRICE OR LESS AND SEVERAL STRUTTED
AND SOMETIMES EVEN A FAIR STRANGER'S AN ALMOST TWELVEMONTH'S CONSTANCY ENDANGERS
A SAD TALE SADDENS DOUBLY WHEN T IS LONG BUT DROOP NOT FORTUNE AT YOUR TIME OF LIFE ALTHOUGH A FEMALE MODERATELY FICKLE WILL HARDLY LEAVE YOU AS SHE S NOT YOUR WIFE FOR ANY LENGTH OF DAYS IN SUCH A PICKLE
ALL THINGS WHICH FORM A TURKISH DANDY WHILE HE WAS DRESSING BABA THEIR BLACK FRIEND HINTED THE VAST ADVANTAGES WHICH THEY MIGHT PROBABLY ATTAIN BOTH IN THE END IF THEY WOULD BUT PURSUE THE PROPER WAY WHICH FORTUNE PLAINLY SEEM'D TO RECOMMEND
REJOIN'D THE NEGRO PRAY BE NOT PROVOKING
SOME SPEAKERS WHINE AND OTHERS LAY THE LASH ON BUT MORE OR LESS CONTINUE STILL TO TEASE ON WITH ARGUMENTS ACCORDING TO THEIR FORTE
TURNING ROUND YOU SCARCELY CAN BE THIRTY HAVE YOU THREE
AS EELS ARE TO BE FLAY'D
BUT THAT OF LATE YOUR SCRIBBLERS THINK IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO REAR WHOLE HOTBEDS IN THEIR WORKS BECAUSE ONE POET TRAVELL'D MONGST THE TURKS
VOLTAIRE SAYS NO
IF THEY WOULD CONDESCEND TO CIRCUMCISION FOR HIS OWN PART HE REALLY SHOULD REJOICE TO SEE THEM TRUE BELIEVERS BUT NO LESS WOULD LEAVE HIS PROPOSITION TO THEIR CHOICE
PULL'D FORTH A QUANTITY OF CLOTHES FIT FOR THE BACK OF ANY MUSSULMAN WHATE'ER HIS WORTH AND OF VARIETY THERE WAS NO LACK AND YET THOUGH I HAVE SAID THERE WAS NO DEARTH
OR BECAUSE THEY WON'T THOUGH CLAUDIUS RICH ESQUIRE SOME BRICKS HAS GOT AND WRITTEN LATELY TWO MEMOIRS UPON'T BELIEVE THE JEWS
AS THEY WERE PLODDING ON THEIR WINDING WAY THROUGH ORANGE BOWERS AND JASMINE AND SO FORTH OF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE A GOOD DEAL TO SAY THERE BEING NO SUCH PROFUSION IN THE NORTH OF ORIENTAL PLANTS ET CETERA
QUITE CONSCIOUS OF HER STATION THEY TROD AS UPON NECKS AND TO COMPLETE HER STATE IT IS THE CUSTOM OF HER NATION A PONIARD DECK'D HER GIRDLE AS THE SIGN SHE WAS A SULTAN'S BRIDE
AS TO DISCOVER IF THEY WERE FITTED FOR THE PURPOSED CAGE NO LADY E'ER IS OGLED BY A LOVER HORSE BY A BLACKLEG BROADCLOTH BY A TAILOR
THOUGH THEY BELIEVE NOT YOU YET LET THEM THINK THAT HORACE HAS EXPREST SHORTLY AND SWEETLY THE MASONIC FOLLY OF THOSE FORGETTING THE GREAT PLACE OF REST WHO GIVE THEMSELVES TO ARCHITECTURE WHOLLY
HAVE YOU NO FRIENDS
ADDING THAT THIS WAS COMMONEST AND BEST FOR THROUGH THE SOUTH THE CUSTOM STILL COMMANDS THE GENTLEMAN TO KISS THE LADY'S HANDS AND HE ADVANCED THOUGH WITH BUT A BAD GRACE
YES SAID THE OTHER AND WHEN DONE WHAT THEN HOW GET OUT HOW THE DEVIL GOT WE IN
THERE WAS NO END UNTO THE THINGS SHE BOUGHT NOR TO THE TROUBLE WHICH HER FANCIES CAUSED YET EVEN HER TYRANNY HAD SUCH A GRACE
OR A PRETTY OPERA SCENE AND NEARER AS THEY CAME
AS IS A SLAVE BY HIS INTENDED BIDDER T IS PLEASANT PURCHASING OUR FELLOW CREATURES AND ALL ARE TO BE SOLD IF YOU CONSIDER THEIR PASSIONS AND ARE DEXT'ROUS
FLANK'D BY LARGE GROVES WHICH TOWER'D ON EITHER HAND THEY ALMOST LOST THEIR WAY AND HAD TO PICK IT FOR NIGHT WAS DOSING ERE THEY CAME TO LAND THE EUNUCH MADE A SIGN TO THOSE ON BOARD WHO ROW'D OFF LEAVING THEM WITHOUT A WORD
EACH BEVY WITH THE MERCHANT IN HIS STATION POOR CREATURES
I HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO TELL THE REASON
HE CHOSE HIMSELF TO POINT OUT WHAT HE THOUGHT MOST PROPER FOR THE CHRISTIANS HE HAD BOUGHT THE SUIT HE THOUGHT MOST SUITABLE TO EACH WAS FOR THE ELDER AND THE STOUTER FIRST A CANDIOTE CLOAK
THE OTHER THANKING HIM FOR THIS EXCESS OF GOODNESS IN THUS LEAVING THEM A VOICE IN SUCH A TRIFLE SCARCELY COULD EXPRESS SUFFICIENTLY HE SAID HIS APPROBATION OF ALL THE CUSTOMS OF THIS POLISH'D NATION
AND SUCH COMFORTABLE QUARTERS TO BE PUT UP FOR AUCTION AMONGST TARTARS WERE THINGS TO SHAKE A STOIC NE'ERTHELESS UPON THE WHOLE HIS CARRIAGE WAS SERENE HIS FIGURE
A GAUDY TASTE FOR THEY ARE LITTLE SKILL'D IN THE ARTS OF WHICH THESE LANDS WERE ONCE THE FONT
OF OTTOMAN PARADE I WON'T DESCRIBE
BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW IT BETTERS PRESENT TIMES WITH ME OR YOU NO QUOTH THE OTHER YET YOU WILL ALLOW BY SETTING THINGS IN THEIR RIGHT POINT OF VIEW KNOWLEDGE AT LEAST IS GAIN'D FOR INSTANCE NOW
LOVE LIKE RELIGION SOMETIMES RUNS TO HERESY THIS MONSTROUS TALE HAD PROBABLY ITS SOURCE FOR SUCH EXAGGERATIONS HERE AND THERE I SEE IN WRITING COURSER BY MISTAKE FOR COURIER
I WON'T BE BAIL FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THEY BOW'D OBEISANCE AND WITHDREW
WE WHOSE MINDS COMPREHEND ALL THINGS NO MORE BUT LET US TO THE STORY AS BEFORE
HER BEAUTY OF THAT OVERPOWERING KIND WHOSE FORCE DESCRIPTION ONLY WOULD ABATE I D RATHER LEAVE IT MUCH TO YOUR OWN MIND THAN LESSEN IT BY WHAT I COULD RELATE OF FORMS AND FEATURES
UNLESS MAN WERE A PIG INDEED REPLETION RATHER ADDS TO WHAT HE FEELS
THE EUROPEAN WITH THE ASIAN SHORE SPRINKLED WITH PALACES THE OCEAN STREAM HERE AND THERE STUDDED WITH A SEVENTY FOUR SOPHIA'S CUPOLA WITH GOLDEN GLEAM
BUT TIME STRIPS OUR ILLUSIONS OF THEIR HUE AND ONE BY ONE IN TURN SOME GRAND MISTAKE CASTS OFF ITS BRIGHT SKIN YEARLY LIKE THE SNAKE
WHAT DID SHE SHE DID NOT RUN AWAY TOO DID SHE SIR
THE SPIRIT IN THE END WILL HAVE ITS WAY HER VERY SMILE WAS HAUGHTY THOUGH SO SWEET HER VERY NOD WAS NOT AN INCLINATION THERE WAS A SELF WILL EVEN IN HER SMALL FEET AS THOUGH THEY WERE
ONE SEEMS NOTHING IN DESERTS FORESTS CROWDS OR BY THE SHORE THERE SOLITUDE WE KNOW HAS HER FULL GROWTH IN THE SPOTS WHICH WERE HER REALMS FOR EVERMORE BUT IN A MIGHTY HALL OR GALLERY
BUT THIS LAST BLOW AND HERE HE STOPP'D AGAIN AND TURN'D AWAY HIS FACE AY QUOTH HIS FRIEND
ONLY TWO AT PRESENT ABOVE GROUND
AND STRIPP'D AND LOOK'D TO BUT WHY SHOULD I AD MORE CIRCUMSTANCES VAIN WAS EVERY CARE THE MAN WAS GONE IN SOME ITALIAN QUARREL KILL'D BY FIVE BULLETS FROM AN OLD GUN BARREL
HE DOUBTED NOT A FEW HOURS OF REFLECTION WOULD RECONCILE HIM TO THE BUSINESS QUITE WILL IT
PROVIDED ALWAYS YOUR GREAT GOODNESS STILL REMITS THE MATTER TO OUR OWN FREE WILL
