EACH WAS UNDENIABLY GOOD LOOKING AND EMINENTLY HEALTHY NO ONE WOULD HAVE DOUBTED THAT BOTH HAD LIVED A GOOD DEAL OF AN OPEN AIR EXISTENCE THE BOY WAS ALREADY MUSCULAR AND SINEWY
HE FOLLOWED HIS QUARRY AWAY FROM THE LITTLE TOWN
FELT THAT SHE WAS NOT GOING TO BE PUT OFF WITH ORDINARY EXCUSES HE HESITATED AND SHE WENT ON SPEAKING YOU KNOW SHE CONTINUED ALMOST PLEADINGLY WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING AT ALL I NEVER HAVE KNOWN
THERE'S SOMETHING I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO KNOW PERSONALLY SHE ANSWERED AFTER A PAUSE WHICH LASTED SO LONG THAT RANSFORD BEGAN TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE UNDER IT DON'T BE ANGRY OR HURT IF I TELL YOU PLAINLY WHAT IT IS
OF WRITING A BOOK ON ENGLISH SURNAMES
HE SAID THAT HE SHOULD SETTLE DOWN FOR A TIME AT SOME RESIDENTIAL HOTEL IN LONDON AND IN THE MEANTIME HE HAD ONE OR TWO CALLS OR VISITS TO MAKE IN THE COUNTRY WHEN HE RETURNED FROM THEM HE SAID HE WOULD CALL ON ME AGAIN HE GAVE ME VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT HIMSELF
RICHARD JENKINS DIED MARCH EIGHTH SEVENTEEN FIFTEEN BURIED IN PARADISE MARCH TENTH HE NEARLY LAUGHED ALOUD AT THE EASE WITH WHICH HE WAS TRACING OUT WHAT AT FIRST HAD SEEMED A DIFFICULT MATTER TO INVESTIGATE
BUT BRYCE SAW THAT HIS COOL ALMOST INDIFFERENT MANNER WAS CHANGING HE WAS BEGINNING UNDER THE SURFACE TO GET ANXIOUS WHEN I LEFT GLASSDALE AT NOON CONTINUED BRYCE I'D NO IDEA AND I DON'T THINK HE HAD
HE STOOD IT TO THE TUNE OF TEN YEARS PENAL SERVITUDE
ANSWERED THE OLD MAN WITH A SMILE MISS BEWERY'S MARRIAGE WHY OF COURSE WHO WAS SHE DEMANDED BRYCE GOVERNESS AT THE VICARAGE REPLIED CLAYBOURNE NICE SWEET YOUNG LADY
JOURNEYING FROM LONDON TO WRYCHESTER MISSUS PARTINGLEY TOLD HOW HE HAD ARRIVED AT THE MITRE REGISTERED IN HER BOOK AS MISTER JOHN BRADEN AND HAD NEXT MORNING ASKED IF HE COULD GET A CONVEYANCE FOR SAXONSTEADE IN THE AFTERNOON AS HE WISHED TO SEE THE DUKE
HE WAS A BANKER THAT ONE REPLIED CLAYBOURNE A BANKER THAT WAS HIS TRADE SIR T'OTHER GENTLEMAN MISTER RANSFORD HE WAS A DOCTOR I MIND THAT WELL ENOUGH BECAUSE ONCE WHEN HIM AND MISTER BRAKE WERE FISHING HERE
BUT HERE BRYCE MET HIS FIRST CHECK DOWN EACH SIDE OF THE OLD CHART DATED EIGHTEEN FIFTY THERE WAS A TABULATED LIST OF THE TOMBS IN PARADISE THE NAMES OF FAMILIES AND PERSONS WERE GIVEN IN THIS LIST
IN ALL HIS SEARCHING HE HAD NOT ONCE COME ACROSS THE NAME THE MAN WHO HAD SPENT A VERY LAZY DAY IN KEEPING AN EYE ON BRYCE AS HE VISITED THE VARIOUS PUBLIC PLACES WHEREAT HE MADE HIS RESEARCHES WAS ALSO KEEPING AN EYE UPON HIM NEXT MORNING WHEN BRYCE BREAKFASTING EARLIER THAN USUAL
DO YOU HAPPEN TO POSSESS A CLERICAL DIRECTORY THE VICAR PRODUCED A CROCKFORD AND BRYCE TURNED OVER ITS PAGES MISTER GILWATERS WHO FROM THE ACCOUNT THERE GIVEN APPEARED TO BE AN ELDERLY MAN WHO HAD NOW RETIRED LIVED IN LONDON IN BAYSWATER
THE FACT IS I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU SO
AND WHAT BEARING HAD IT ON BRADEN OR BRAKE'S DEATH BEFORE HE ATE HIS COLD BEEF BRYCE HAD COPIED THE ENTRY FROM THE REPRINTED REGISTER AND HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF THAT RANSFORD WAS NOT A NAME KNOWN TO THAT VILLAGE
I MEAN ABOUT RECENT MATTERS REPLIED BRYCE I'VE INTERESTED MYSELF IN THEM FOR REASONS OF MY OWN EVER SINCE BRADEN WAS FOUND AT THE FOOT OF THOSE STAIRS IN PARADISE AND I WAS FETCHED TO HIM I'VE INTERESTED MYSELF AND
SET HERE AND THERE IN OLD CHINA BOWLS THROUGH ITS WIDE WINDOWS THE CASEMENTS OF WHICH WERE THROWN WIDE OPEN THERE WAS AN INVITING PROSPECT OF A HIGH EDGED FLOWER GARDEN AND SEEN IN VISTAS THROUGH THE TREES AND SHRUBBERIES
AND LEAVING HIM TO PAY THE PENALTY OF HIS OVER TRUSTFULNESS CLEARED OUT OF ENGLAND AND CARRIED HIS MONEY MAKING TALENTS TO FOREIGN PARTS HE SUCCEEDED IN DOING WELL
HE SAID AS HE PAID THE SEARCH FEES CELEBRATED BY YOUR PREDECESSOR MISTER GILWATERS
GOOD PLACE FOR THAT CERTAINLY AGREED BRYCE FOLLIOT POINTED HIS VISITOR TO ONE OF THE BIG CHAIRS AND TURNING TO A CABINET BROUGHT OUT SOME GLASSES A SYPHON OF SODA WATER AND A HEAVY CUT GLASS DECANTER
A WIDE TERM REMARKED FOLLIOT
AND WITH THAT THE MIDDLE STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS ENDED AND THE LAST ONE CAME WATCHED BY BRYCE WITH INCREASING ANXIETY FOR IT WAS SOON EVIDENT FROM CERTAIN REMARKS MADE BY THE CORONER
THE OTHER'S THE REGISTER OF THOSE IN PARADISE AND THE CLOISTERS WHAT NAMES ARE YOU WANTING TO TRACE BUT BRYCE AFFECTED NOT TO HEAR THE LAST QUESTION HE WALKED OVER TO THE PLACE WHICH CAMPANY HAD INDICATED
YOU'RE WRONG HE ANSWERED I NEVER AT ANY TIME KNEW ANYTHING OF BRAKE'S FAMILY AFFAIRS SO LITTLE INDEED THAT I NEVER EVEN KNEW HE WAS MARRIED BRYCE ROSE TO HIS FEET AND STOOD STARING WHAT HE EXCLAIMED
OR IN EVENING HERE IS A PERPETUAL ATMOSPHERE OF REST AND NOT AROUND THE GREAT CHURCH ALONE BUT IN THE QUAINT AND ANCIENT HOUSES WHICH FENCE IN THE CLOSE LITTLE LESS OLD THAN THE MIGHTY MASS OF STONE ON WHICH THEIR IVY FRAMED WINDOWS LOOK
AND THAT THEY SO FAR AS HE KNEW THEN WERE NOT LIKELY TO AFFECT HIM GREATLY SEEING HIM IN THESE PLEASANT DOMESTIC CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE HEAD OF HIS TABLE WITH ABUNDANT EVIDENCES OF COMFORT AND REFINEMENT AND MODEST LUXURY ABOUT HIM
IT'S THE BEGINNING OF BAD HABITS OH WELL SAID RANSFORD INDULGENTLY HE'S PRETTY FREE FROM ANYTHING OF THAT SORT YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T EVEN SUSPECTED HIM OF SMOKING YET
BUT SUDDENLY REMEMBERING THAT THERE WAS A QUESTION WHICH HE COULD ASK WITHOUT EXCITING ANY SUSPICION OR SURMISE HE FACED ROUND AGAIN ON THE LIBRARIAN ISN'T THERE A REGISTER OF BURIALS WITHIN THE CATHEDRAL HE INQUIRED SOME BOOK IN WHICH THEY'RE PUT DOWN
IN THAT OPEN WINDOW SAT AN OLD CHEERY FACED MAN MENDING SHOES WHO BLINKED AT THE STRANGER THROUGH HIS BIG SPECTACLES BRYCE SAW HIS CHANCE AND TURNED IN TO OPEN THE BOOK AND POINT OUT THE MARRIAGE ENTRY
GOSSIPY OLD GENTLEMAN OF WRYCHESTER BUT AN EMINENTLY PRACTICAL AND BUSINESS LIKE MAN OF AFFAIRS AND NOW AS REGARDS THIS YOUNG FELLOW WHO'S STAYING ACROSS THERE AT THE PEACOCK HE WAS SAYING IN CONCLUSION
AND TAKING DOWN THE SECOND BOOK CARRIED IT TO AN ADJACENT TABLE CAMPANY CALLED ACROSS THE ROOM TO HIM YOU'LL FIND USEFUL INDEXES AT THE END HE SAID THEY'RE ALL BROUGHT UP TO THE PRESENT TIME FROM FOUR HUNDRED YEARS AGO NEARLY
THAT JOHN BRADEN OR BRAKE WAS THE STICKER OF THE SAME ADVERTISEMENT CLEAR CLEAR AS NOONDAY AND WHAT DID IT ALL MEAN AND IMPLY
I'M QUITE SURE IT'S NEVER EVEN OCCURRED TO DICK BUT I'M THREE YEARS AHEAD OF HIM IT'S THIS HAVE WE BEEN DEPENDENT ON YOU RANSFORD'S FACE FLUSHED AND HE TURNED DELIBERATELY TO THE WINDOW
THAT'S BECAUSE HE THINKS SMOKING WOULD STOP HIS GROWTH AND INTERFERE WITH HIS CRICKET ANSWERED MARY HE WOULD SMOKE IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT THAT'S GIVING HIM HIGH PRAISE THEN SAID RANSFORD YOU COULDN'T GIVE HIM HIGHER
YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN HIS FAMILY AFFAIRS SAID BRYCE WHAT BECAME OF BRAKE'S WIFE AND CHILDREN WHEN HE WENT TO PRISON FOLLIOT SHOOK HIS HEAD
THIS IS A LONG WAY FROM WRYCHESTER SIR FOR WRYCHESTER FOLK TO MEET IN I'D NO IDEA OF MEETING YOU MISTER HARKER RESPONDED BRYCE BUT IT'S A SMALL WORLD YOU KNOW AND THERE ARE A GOOD MANY COINCIDENCES IN IT
THEN I CAN CONSIDERABLY SIMPLIFY YOUR LABOURS SAID THE VICAR TAKING DOWN A BOOK FROM ONE OF HIS SHELVES OUR PARISH REGISTERS HAVE BEEN COPIED AND PRINTED AND HERE IS THE VOLUME EVERYTHING IS IN THERE FROM FIFTEEN SEVENTY TO TEN YEARS AGO AND THERE IS A VERY FULL INDEX
AND THE ELM SHADOWED LAWN NOTHING ONE WOULD THINK COULD POSSIBLY EXIST BUT LEISURED AND PLEASANT EXISTENCE EVEN THE BUSY STREETS OF THE OLD CITY OUTSIDE THE CRUMBLING GATEWAY SEEM FOR THE MOMENT FAR OFF
OH WELL I'LL HAVE TO SETTLE WITH HIM MYSELF IT'S USELESS TRIFLING WITH ANYTHING LIKE THAT I GAVE HIM A QUIET HINT BEFORE AND SINCE HE WON'T TAKE IT ALL RIGHT BUT WHAT SHALL YOU DO SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY NOT SEND HIM AWAY
THEN WHO HAD DEMANDED BRYCE WAS IT THE OTHER MAN FLOOD AND IF SO WHO IS FLOOD FOLLIOT GOT UP FROM HIS CHAIR AND CIGAR BETWEEN HIS LIPS AND HANDS UNDER THE TAILS OF HIS OLD COAT
HE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE MIGHT TELL IF HE TOLD ALL THE TRUTH HE THOUGHT OF WHAT HE MIGHT GET OUT OF RANSFORD IF HE BRYCE WERE CORONER OR SOLICITOR AND HAD RANSFORD IN THAT WITNESS BOX HE WOULD ASK HIM ON HIS OATH IF HE KNEW THAT DEAD MAN
THE ADVERTISEMENT IS AS FOLLOWS HE ANNOUNCED IF THIS MEETS THE EYE OF OLD FRIEND MARCO HE WILL LEARN THAT STICKER WISHES TO SEE HIM AGAIN WRITE J BRADEN
AND THEN SHE ROMPED AWAY TO THE FIELDS TO AMUSE HERSELF IN HER OWN WAY SHE CAME TO KNOW EVERY FLOWER THAT GREW AND TO CALL THEM BY NAME AND SHE ALWAYS STEPPED VERY CAREFULLY TO AVOID TREADING ON THEM FOR DOROTHY WAS A KIND HEARTED CHILD
OF COURSE I CONSENTED FOR WE ALL LIKE TO PLEASE OLD SANTA AND A MINUTE LATER I HAD JUMPED INTO THE SLEIGH BESIDE HIM AND WE WERE DASHING AWAY AT FULL SPEED TOWARD HIS CASTLE I ENJOYED THE RIDE VERY MUCH BUT I ENJOYED THE CASTLE FAR MORE
I KNEW YOU WERE COMING SOON PAPA AND HOW DID YOU KNOW SWEETHEART HE ASKED GIVING HER AN EXTRA KISS BECAUSE I WATCHED THE FLOWERS
YOU WILL REALIZE WHAT A LARGE FAMILY THE OLD WOMAN HAD AND HOW FULLY HER TIME WAS OCCUPIED IN CARING FOR THEM ALL AND NOW TO MAKE THE MATTER WORSE HER FOURTH DAUGHTER WHO HAD BEEN NAMED ABIGAIL SUDDENLY TOOK SICK AND DIED AND SHE
SO TOM TOOK HIS FATHER'S PIPES AND WALKED OVER THE HILL TO FARMER BOWSER'S HOUSE FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT TOM TOM THE PIPER'S SON LEARNED TO PLAY WHEN HE WAS YOUNG
BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE STY THERE WAS NO PIG TO BE SEEN AND HE SEARCHED ALL ROUND THE PLACE FOR A GOOD HOUR WITHOUT FINDING IT
A GOOD BEATING AND TOM WAS SO SCARED THAT HE NEVER STOPPED RUNNING UNTIL HE CAME TO THE END OF THE VILLAGE AND HE BAWLED LUSTILY THE WHOLE WAY AND CRIED OUT AT EVERY STEP
I WILL SLEEP UPON THE QUESTION AND TRY TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER TO MORROW BUT THE SCHOOLMASTER COULD NOT SLEEP HE REMAINED AWAKE ALL THE NIGHT TRYING TO THINK WHY A COW DRINKS WATER FROM A BROOK
GARDENS ARE ALL WELL ENOUGH FOR FANCY FLOWERS TO GROW IN BUT THE POSIES THAT GOD GAVE TO ALL THE WORLD AND MADE TO GROW WILD IN THE GREAT GARDEN OF NATURE
AND DOES N'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND EM BUT LEAVE EM ALONE AND THEY LL COME HOME ALL WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND EM LITTLE BO PEEP SAT STILL AND WATCHED THE OLD WOMAN TOIL SLOWLY UP THE HILL SIDE AND DISAPPEAR OVER THE TOP BY AND BY SHE THOUGHT
AND THOSE WHO MET HER WONDERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MAKE THE SWEET LITTLE MAID SO ANXIOUS BUT THERE IS AN END TO ALL TROUBLES NO MATTER HOW SEVERE THEY MAY SEEM TO BE AND IT HAPPENED ONE DAY AS BO PEEP DID STRAY UNTO A MEADOW HARD BY
THE ROOMS ARE BIG AND HIGH AND THERE IS A SOFT CARPET UPON EVERY FLOOR AND MANY STRANGE THINGS SCATTERED AROUND TO AMUSE ONE SANTA CLAUS LIVES THERE ALL ALONE EXCEPT FOR OLD MOTHER HUBBARD WHO COOKS THE MEALS FOR HIM
PRINTED BY T FLEET AT HIS PRINTING HOUSE IN PUDDING LANE SEVENTEEN NINETEEN PRICE TWO COPPERS MISTER WM A WHEELER THE EDITOR OF HURD AND HOUGHTON'S ELABORATE EDITION OF MOTHER GOOSE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY REITERATED THIS ASSERTION
AND SO HE WENT SOFTLY UP TO THE PIG STY AND REACHED OVER AND GRABBED THE LITTLE PIG BY THE EARS THE PIG SQUEALED OF COURSE BUT THE FARMER WAS MAKING SO MUCH NOISE HIMSELF THAT HE DID NOT HEAR IT
A FLOWER GARDEN REPEATED HER MOTHER IN SURPRISE WHY DO YOU WISH A FLOWER GARDEN MARY I WANT TO PLANT IN IT THE COCKLE SHELLS AND THE COWSLIPS AND THE DINGLE BELLS SHE ANSWERED AND HER MOTHER
AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO DO NEXT I D LIKE TO GET BACK TO THE MOON SAID THE MAN
PRAY TELL ME DEAR THOUGH MUCH I FEAR THE ANSWER SAD I KNOW HOW GROW THE STURDY COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL IN A ROW AND MARY LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH HER BRIGHT SMILE AND ANSWERED
BUT THEN YOU SEE I HAVE BEEN MAKING TOYS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND I MAKE SO MANY IT IS NO WONDER I AM SKILLFUL AND NOW IF YOU ARE READY TO GO HOME I LL HITCH UP THE REINDEER AND TAKE YOU BACK AGAIN
UNTIL THE RABBIT BECAME REASSURED AND BLINKED HIS BIG EYES AT HER THOUGHTFULLY FOR HE WAS AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE LITTLE GIRL AS SHE IN HIM SINCE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DARED TO MEET A PERSON FACE TO FACE
WILL YOU HAVE IT HOT OR COLD SIR OH COLD BY ALL MEANS REPLIED THE MAN FOR I DETEST ANYTHING HOT TO EAT SHE SOON BROUGHT HIM A BOWL OF COLD PEASE PORRIDGE
THE WOND'ROUS WISE MAN
AND ONE OF THESE FLOCKS USED TO BE CARED FOR BY A POOR WOMAN WHO SUPPORTED HERSELF AND HER LITTLE GIRL BY THIS MEANS THEY LIVED IN A SMALL COTTAGE NESTLED AT THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE HILLS AND EACH MORNING THE MOTHER TOOK HER CROOK
BUT HE WAS SO SLY AND CAUTIOUS THAT NO ONE HAD EVER CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT OF STEALING ALTHOUGH A GOOD MANY THINGS HAD BEEN MISSED AFTER THEY HAD FALLEN INTO THE OLD MAN'S WAY BARNEY HAD ONE SON NAMED TOM
NO ANSWERED TOM SHAKING HIS HEAD NO ONE WILL GIVE ME A PENNY FOR PLAYING
AND A WRITER IN THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT OF JUNE SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR SAYS FLEET'S BOOK WAS PARTLY A REPRINT OF AN ENGLISH COLLECTION OF SONGS BARCLAY'S AND THE NEW TITLE WAS DOUBTLESS A COMPLIMENT BY THE PRINTER TO HIS MOTHER IN LAW GOOSE FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS
GAZED BELOW HER QUIETLY FEEDING UPON THE RICH GRASS WAS HER TRUANT FLOCK LOOKING AS PEACEFUL AND INNOCENT AS IF IT HAD NEVER STRAYED AWAY FROM ITS GENTLE SHEPHERDESS BO PEEP UTTERED A CRY OF JOY AND HURRIED TOWARD THEM
THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS DISCOVERY AND REACHING UP HER CROOK SHE KNOCKED THE ROW OF PRETTY WHITE TAILS OFF THE TREE AND GATHERED THEM UP IN HER FROCK BUT HOW TO FASTEN THEM ONTO HER SHEEP AGAIN WAS THE QUESTION
SOME OF THE CHILDREN HEARD HIM SAY THIS AND THEY RESOLVED TO PLAY HIM A TRICK IN RETURN FOR HIS ILL NATURED SPEECH THE BAKER MAN CAME EVERY DAY TO THE SHOE HOUSE AND BROUGHT TWO GREAT BASKETS OF BREAD
STROKING HER CURLS TENDERLY AS HE SPOKE WELL WELL MY DARLING IT WILL BE A LONG TIME INDEED DO YOU KNOW THE COWSLIPS THAT GROW IN THE PASTURES MARY OH YES I WATCH FOR THEM EVERY SPRING SHE ANSWERED
WHAT SHALL WE DO HE ASKED HIS FATHER GO HUNGRY REPLIED BARNEY UNLESS YOU WANT TO TAKE MY PIPES AND PLAY IN THE VILLAGE
SO FOR SEVERAL DAYS I WATCHED HIM MAKING ALL KINDS OF TOYS AND I WONDERED TO SEE HOW QUICKLY HE MADE THEM AND HOW MANY NEW THINGS HE INVENTED I ALMOST WISH I WAS A CHILD I SAID TO HIM ONE DAY FOR THEN I TOO COULD HAVE PLAYTHINGS
IT WAS ONE MORNING AFTER CHRISTMAS SAID THE RABBIT WHO SEEMED TO ENJOY TALKING NOW THAT HE HAD OVERCOME HIS FEAR OF DOROTHY AND I WAS SITTING BY THE ROAD SIDE WHEN SANTA CLAUS CAME RIDING BACK IN HIS EMPTY SLEIGH HE DOES NOT COME HOME QUITE SO FAST AS HE GOES
THE SHOCK OF THIS ANSWER WAS SO GREAT THAT THE SCHOOLMASTER FAINTED AWAY AND WHEN THEY HAD BROUGHT HIM TO HE MADE A PROPHECY THAT SOLOMON WOULD GROW UP TO BE A WOND'ROUS WISE MAN
THEY TOOK CARE NOT TO PLAY ANY MORE TRICKS ON THE BAKER MAN AND AS THEY GREW OLDER THEY WERE NATURALLY MUCH BETTER BEHAVED BEFORE MANY YEARS THE BOYS WERE OLD ENOUGH TO WORK FOR THE NEIGHBORING FARMERS AND THAT MADE THE WOMAN'S FAMILY A GOOD DEAL SMALLER
I VERY MUCH SUSPECT THE REAL REASON THEY ARE DYING IS BECAUSE THE COLD SEA WIND CAUGHT THEM LAST NIGHT DINGLE BELLS ARE DELICATE IF YOU HAD SCATTERED THE COCKLE SHELLS AND COWSLIPS ALL ABOUT THEM THE STRONGER PLANTS WOULD HAVE PROTECTED THE WEAKER BUT YOU SEE MY GIRL
THE FARMER GAVE ME NOTHING BUT A SCOLDING BUT THERE WAS A VERY NICE PIG RUNNING AROUND THE YARD HOW BIG WAS IT ASKED BARNEY OH JUST ABOUT BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE A NICE DINNER FOR YOU AND ME
OH SAID LITTLE BO PEEP IN SURPRISE DO THEY WAG THEIR TAILS I NEVER NOTICED THAT INDEED EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN THEN YOU ARE NOT VERY OBSERVING FOR ONE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT SHEEP
BUT WHEN SHE CAME NEAR SHE STOPPED IN AMAZEMENT AND HELD UP HER LITTLE HANDS WITH A PRETTY EXPRESSION OF DISMAY SHE HAD FOUND THEM INDEED BUT IT MADE HER HEART BLEED
SEEMED SO SENSELESS AND SILLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO OVERHEARD THEM THAT THEY BEGAN TO CALL HER MOTHER GOOSE IN DERISION THE TERM BEING DERIVED FROM QUEEN GOOSEFOOT THE MOTHER OF CHARLEMAGNE THE OLD NURSE PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER CRITICS
AND BO PEEP HAD FULLY DECIDED TO SEEK FOR THE TAILS AND FIND THEM BEFORE SHE RELATED THE STORY OF THEIR LOSS TO ANYONE EACH DAY FOR MANY DAYS AFTER THAT LITTLE BO PEEP WANDERED ABOUT THE HILLS SEEKING THE TAILS OF HER SHEEP
THE OLD WOMAN CHUCKLED SOFTLY AS IF THE ANSWER AMUSED HER AND REPLIED NO ONE KNOWS ALL ABOUT ANYTHING MY DEAR BUT I KNOW ALL ABOUT MY SHEEP PROTESTED LITTLE BO PEEP DO YOU INDEED
AND I SEE THE DOGS AND THE MEN LONG BEFORE THEY CAN SEE ME OR KNOW THAT I AM NEAR AND THEREFORE I AM ABLE TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY IS THAT THE REASON YOUR EYES ARE SO BIG ASKED DOROTHY I SUPPOSE SO RETURNED THE RABBIT
HE STRUGGLED OUT OF MY CLASP AND DISAPPEARED OVER THE LONG GRASSES WITH SOUNDLESS LEAPS
SARA MIGHT BETTER HAVE STAYED HOME SHE WAS OF NO USE AND COULD ONLY ADD TO THE GENERAL CONFUSION WANDERING AIMLESSLY ABOUT CRYING AND ASKING IF DAN WAS GOING TO DIE
A WISHING FAIRY MIGHT HAVE HAD THE TIME OF HER LIFE IN THE KING KITCHEN THAT MORNING PARTICULARLY IF SHE WERE A CYNICALLY INCLINED FAIRY
ALL DAY SHE SAT IN THE KITCHEN AND WORKED BUTTONHOLES SUBSISTING ON BREAD AND WATER AND MEXICAN TEA FELICITY DID A MEAN THING SHE WENT TO WORK AND MADE LITTLE RAISIN PIES RIGHT THERE IN THE KITCHEN BEFORE THE STORY GIRL
JUST THINK HOW MANY NEW STORIES I'D HAVE TO TELL AFTER I'D HEARD HIM NO I MUST GO BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL DO I'LL WEAR MY SCHOOL DRESS AND HAT THAT WILL BE PENANCE FELICITY WHEN YOU SET THE TABLE FOR DINNER PUT THE BROKEN HANDLED KNIFE FOR ME I HATE IT SO
SHE BANGED THINGS ABOUT AND RATTLED THE STOVE COVERS UNTIL EVEN CECILY PROTESTED FROM HER SOFA DAN SAT ON THE FLOOR AND WHITTLED
WHY TWINS ARE JUST PEOPLE THAT SQUINT AREN'T THEY SAID PETER WE THOUGHT HE WAS TRYING TO BE FUNNY UNTIL WE FOUND OUT THAT HE WAS QUITE IN EARNEST THEN WE LAUGHED UNTIL PETER GOT SULKY I DON'T CARE HE SAID HOW'S A FELLOW TO KNOW
HOW ON EARTH DID YOU MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE IT LOOKED JUST LIKE CORNMEAL SAID THE STORY GIRL GOING FROM WHITE TO RED IN HER SHAME WELL I'M GOING TO GIVE UP TRYING TO COOK AND STICK TO THINGS I CAN DO
FELICITY IF I DIE FROM THE EFFECTS OF EATING SAWDUST PUDDING FLAVOURED WITH NEEDLES YOU'LL BE SORRY YOU EVER SAID SUCH A THING TO YOUR POOR OLD UNCLE SAID UNCLE ROGER REPROACHFULLY EVEN IF THERE WERE NO NEEDLES IN IT
I DON'T CARE WHAT SHE WOULD SAY HE RETORTED FELICITY TRIED ANOTHER TACK YOU'LL BE SURE TO GET WHIPPED IF YOU FIGHT WITH PETER SHE SAID YOU'RE TOO FAT TO FIGHT
CECILY GAVE A SHRIEK AND RAN OUT OF THE WOOD WE THOUGHT SHE HAD FLED BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE SIGHT OF BLOOD AND WE WERE NOT SORRY FOR HER MANIFEST DISAPPROVAL AND ANXIETY WERE DAMPING THE EXCITEMENT OF THE OCCASION
OCTOBER WAS A BUSY MONTH ON THE HILL FARMS THE APPLES HAD TO BE PICKED AND THIS WORK FELL MAINLY TO US CHILDREN WE STAYED HOME FROM SCHOOL TO DO IT IT WAS PLEASANT WORK AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF FUN IN IT
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR A HORRIBLE FEAR WHICH FLASHED INTO HER MIND THAT POSSIBLY SAWDUST PUDDINGS WERE NOT HEALTHY FOR PEOPLE TO EAT
WITH A HIGHWAYMAN ON A MOONLIT HEATH AND BUSKIRK'S GIRL WHO JOINED THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF TEMPERANCE JUST TO SEE WHAT WAS INTO IT AND IN EACH IMPERSONATION SHE WAS SO THOROUGHLY THE THING IMPERSONATED
I DO SAID THE STORY GIRL SAGELY WHEN NEXT WE ASSEMBLED OURSELVES TOGETHER IT WAS AFTER MILKING AND THE CARES OF THE DAY WERE DONE WITH WE FOREGATHERED IN THE BALSAM FRAGRANT AISLES OF THE FIR WOOD
AND AS HE DID THERE CAME RUSHING OVER THE RAINBOW BRIDGE A GREAT COMPANY THE BAND OF FELLOW TRAVELLERS BUT ALL WERE TOO LATE TO WIN THE DOUBLE BOON VING HAD WON TO IT THROUGH THE DANGER AND SUFFERING OF THE DARK RIVER
PEOPLING THE RUSSET ARCADES WITH FOLK OF AN ELDER WORLD MANY A PRINCESS RODE BY US ON HER PALFREY MANY A SWAGGERING GALLANT RUFFLED IT BRAVELY IN VELVET AND PLUME ADOWN UNCLE STEPHEN'S WALK MANY A STATELY LADY SILKEN CLAD
BUT ONLY TO THAT ONE WHO SHALL DRINK OF IT FIRST SHALL BE PERMITTED TO WALK AT ODIN'S RIGHT HAND FOREVER THEN THE COMPANY PASSED THROUGH IN GREAT HASTE ALL FIRED WITH A DESIRE
TALL AND STRAIGHT WAS HE AS A YOUNG PINE AND HIS LONG HAIR WAS THE COLOUR OF RIPE WHEAT IN THE SUN AND HIS BLUE EYES WERE LIKE THE NORTHLAND HEAVENS ON A STARRY NIGHT IN ODIN'S BAND WAS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN NAMED ALIN
GAMBLING WHAT WOULD AUNT JANE SAY IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO FIGHT CECILY DEMANDED OF PETER DON'T YOU DRAG MY AUNT JANE INTO THIS AFFAIR SAID PETER DARKLY YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE A PRESBYTERIAN
SHE SAYS NONE OF US MUST GO NEAR THE PLACE TILL WE KNOW WHETHER IT IS THE MEASLES OR NOT I'VE THOUGHT OF A GREAT PENANCE SAID CECILY EAGERLY DON'T GO TO THE MISSIONARY MEETING TO NIGHT THE STORY GIRL LOOKED PITEOUS
AND SHE IS AFRAID IT'S THE MEASLES FELICITY FLUNG THE LAST SENTENCE AT THE STORY GIRL WHO TURNED VERY PALE OH DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE CAUGHT THEM AT THE MAGIC LANTERN SHOW SHE SAID MISERABLY
HE TORMENTED HER FOR THE REST OF THE SUMMER NEVER A BREAKFAST DID HE SIT DOWN TO WITHOUT GRAVELY INQUIRING IF THEY WERE SURE THERE WAS NO SAWDUST IN THE PORRIDGE
HE STRODE ALONG RIGHT MASTERFULLY AND LIFTED HIS HEAD WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO WAS MONARCH OF ALL HE SURVEYED THE STORY GIRL KISSED HER FINGERTIPS TO HIM WITH THE DELIGHTFUL AUDACITY WHICH WAS A PART OF HER
BUT IT WAS OVER TWO HOURS SINCE WE HAD EATEN THE COOKIES AND FELICITY SUGGESTED THAT A SAUCERFUL APIECE
IT'S BEEN A HORRID DAY ALL THROUGH SAID FELICITY DREARILY AS WE CLIMBED THE STAIRS I SUPPOSE WE MADE IT HORRID OURSELVES SAID THE STORY GIRL CANDIDLY BUT IT'LL BE A GOOD STORY TO TELL SOMETIME SHE ADDED
RIDDLING THE FIRE NOISILY ANY ONE WHO LIVES WITH YOU FELICITY KING WILL ALWAYS BE WISHING HE WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE SAID DAN I WASN'T TALKING TO YOU DAN KING RETORTED FELICITY SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO COME WHEN YOU'RE CALLED
WERE VERY FAIR TO VIEW NEVERTHELESS ALTHOUGH NONE OF US NOT EVEN UNCLE ROGER OR FELICITY SAID A WORD AT THE TIME FOR FEAR OF HURTING THE STORY GIRL'S FEELINGS THE PUDDING DID NOT TASTE EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD IT WAS TOUGH DECIDEDLY TOUGH
BY TEA TIME THINGS HAD BRIGHTENED UP THE RAIN HAD CEASED AND THE OLD LOW RAFTERED ROOM WAS FULL OF SUNSHINE WHICH DANCED ON THE SHINING DISHES OF THE DRESSER MADE MOSAICS ON THE FLOOR
IT'S ALL PETER'S FAULT SAID FELICITY I DO THINK HE MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE SENSE THAN TO TAKE A CLOCK STRIKING FOR A BELL RINGING
AND YOU'VE GOT TO STOP IT PETER CRAIG
THAT WE DID NOT WONDER IN THE LEAST AT THE KING'S LOVE FOR HER I HAD READ THE STORY BEFORE AND IT HAD BEEN MY OPINION THAT IT WAS ROT NO KING I FELT CERTAIN WOULD EVER MARRY A BEGGAR MAID WHEN HE HAD PRINCESSES GALORE FROM WHOM TO CHOOSE
IF THEY DON'T DIE COMPLETELY OF THEM IT LEAVES THEM DEAF
UNCLE ROGER SAYS PETER'S FATHER WASN'T EXACTLY LAZY SAID THE STORY GIRL THE TROUBLE WAS THERE WERE SO MANY OTHER THINGS HE LIKED BETTER THAN WORK
IT WAS ULTIMATELY ARRANGED THAT THE COMBAT SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE FIR WOOD BEHIND UNCLE ROGER'S GRANARY IT WAS A NICE REMOTE BOSKY PLACE WHERE NO PROWLING GROWN UP WOULD BE LIKELY TO INTRUDE
AND THE PRECINCTS OF A POSSIBLY ENCHANTED SPRING WHEN WE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE ORCHARD AND ENTERED IT THROUGH A GAP IN THE HEDGE IT WAS THE MAGICAL MYSTICAL TIME OF BETWEEN LIGHTS OFF TO THE WEST WAS A DAFFODIL GLOW HANGING OVER THE VALLEY OF LOST SUNSETS
THE STORY GIRL WAS NOT TO BE COMFORTED I'D GIVE ANYTHING IF I'D NEVER PUT SARA UP TO GOING TO THAT SHOW SHE SAID IT'S ALL MY FAULT BUT THE PUNISHMENT FALLS ON SARA AND THAT ISN'T FAIR I'D GO THIS MINUTE AND CONFESS THE WHOLE THING TO MISSUS RAY
SHUT UP HE SAID I SHUT UP FELICITY AND CECILY WERE SETTING OUT A LUNCH IN THE PANTRY WHEN WE WERE ALL STARTLED BY A LOUD GROAN FROM THE SOFA
TO BE THE FIRST TO DRINK OF THE FOUNTAIN AND WIN SO MARVELLOUS A BOON LAST OF ALL CAME VING HE HAD LINGERED BEHIND TO PLUCK A THORN FROM THE FOOT OF A BEGGAR CHILD HE HAD MET ON THE HIGHWAY AND HE HAD NOT HEARD THE WARDER'S WORDS
TELL HIM TO SWALLOW A CAT ROARED THE POOR DOCTOR AND SLAMMED HIS DOOR NOW IF UNCLE ROGER HAS SWALLOWED ANY NEEDLES MAYBE IT WOULD MAKE IT ALL RIGHT IF HE SWALLOWED A PINCUSHION
AND IN HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE SHE DEEMED THAT SHE HAD A RIGHT TO RULE SUPREME SHE KNEW BETTER THAN TO MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO ASSERT AUTHORITY OVER THE STORY GIRL AND FELIX AND I WERE ALLOWED SOME LENGTH OF TETHER BUT CECILY DAN AND PETER WERE EXPECTED TO SUBMIT
IF I PUT IT OFF ANY LONGER IT WILL BE TOO LATE I'M GROWING SO FAST AUNT OLIVIA SAYS I'LL HAVE TO WEAR ANKLE SKIRTS NEXT SUMMER IF I BEGIN TO LOOK GROWN UP HE'LL GET FRIGHTENED OF ME AND THEN I'LL NEVER FIND OUT THE GOLDEN MILESTONE MYSTERY
BUT NOW I UNDERSTOOD IT ALL WHEN FELICITY RETURNED WE CONCLUDED FROM HER EXPRESSION THAT SHE HAD NEWS AND SHE HAD SARA IS REAL SICK SHE SAID WITH REGRET AND SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT REGRET MINGLED IN HER VOICE
NOBODY EVER KNEW THEY SUPPOSED HE HAD SEEN HIM THROUGH THE WINDOW BEFORE HE CAME INTO THE HOUSE
THAT'S ONLY MY OLD APRON SAID FELICITY I HUNG IT THERE TO DAY WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR THE WHITE HEN'S NEST OH WHAT SHALL WE DO UNCLE ROGER MAY NOT BE BACK FOR HOURS I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE MAYBE IT'S ONLY PEG BOWEN SUGGESTED DAN
PAT CAME OVER BUT HIS MOST SEDUCTIVE PURRS WON NO NOTICE FROM HIS MISTRESS WHO REFUSED HERSELF THE PLEASURE OF EVEN PATTING HIM AUNT JANET COULD NOT GO DOWN THE HILL IN THE AFTERNOON TO FIND OUT HOW SARA WAS BECAUSE COMPANY CAME TO TEA
I NEVER READ THEM SAID MISS ELIOT I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT POLITICS SHE ADDED THE PIANO IS IN TUNE SAID CLARA PASSING THEM BUT WE MAY HAVE TO ASK SOME ONE TO MOVE IT FOR US ARE THEY GOING TO DANCE ASKED MISTER SALVIN
LIFE IS WICKED LIFE IS DETESTABLE CRIED ROSE SHAW THERE'S NOT MUCH TO BE SAID FOR THIS SORT OF THING IS THERE SAID TIMOTHY DURRANT TO JACOB WOMEN LIKE IT LIKE WHAT SAID CHARLOTTE WILDING COMING UP TO THEM
IT WAS ONLY THAT HE COULD MAKE NO SENSE HIMSELF OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY EXCITEMENT AND AS FOR WRITING IT DOWN JACOB'S LETTERS ARE SO LIKE HIM SAID MISSUS JARVIS FOLDING THE SHEET
MORE HORSES LEGS HAVE BEEN WORN OUT MORE COACHMEN'S LIVES CONSUMED MORE HOURS OF SOUND AFTERNOON TIME VAINLY LAVISHED THAN SERVED TO WIN US THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AND PAY FOR IT INTO THE BARGAIN
AS THOUGH IT COULD IMPOSE ITSELF UPON TIME AND THE OPEN AIR NOW A FOX STEALS OUT FROM BEHIND THE GORSE BUSHES OFTEN EVEN AT NIGHT THE CHURCH SEEMS FULL OF PEOPLE THE PEWS ARE WORN AND GREASY
TOO PALE AS USUAL THE CRITICS WOULD SAY IT WAS TOO PALE FOR HE WAS AN UNKNOWN MAN EXHIBITING OBSCURELY
I DON'T WANT YOU RIGHT ON THE TABLE SHE WAVED HER HANDS SWOLLEN IRIDESCENT PIGEONS WERE WADDLING ROUND THEIR FEET LOOK AT THAT WOMAN'S HAT SAID CRUTTENDON
I AM AFRAID I DID NOT CATCH YOUR NAME SAID MISS EDWARDS CALTHORP SAID MISTER CALTHORP BUT WHAT PROOF WAS THERE THAT THE MARRIAGE SERVICE WAS ACTUALLY PERFORMED SAID MISTER CROSBY

WILL HE SAID JINNY LOOKING AT JACOB YOU YES HE'LL COME WITH US SAID CRUTTENDON AND THEN HERE IS VERSAILLES JINNY STOOD ON THE STONE RIM AND LEANT OVER THE POND
THAT'S IT THAT'S MORE LIKE IT THAT'S HE SQUIRMED HIS THUMB IN A CIRCLE ROUND A LAMP GLOBE PAINTED WHITE A PRETTY SOLID PIECE OF WORK SAID JACOB STRADDLING HIS LEGS IN FRONT OF IT BUT WHAT I WISH YOU'D EXPLAIN
NO FLANDERS I DON'T THINK I COULD LIVE LIKE YOU WHEN ONE WALKS DOWN THAT STREET OPPOSITE THE BRITISH MUSEUM WHAT'S IT CALLED THAT'S WHAT I MEAN IT'S ALL LIKE THAT THOSE FAT WOMEN
THE VOICE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY SADNESS PURE FROM ALL BODY PURE FROM ALL PASSION GOING OUT INTO THE WORLD SOLITARY UNANSWERED BREAKING AGAINST ROCKS SO IT SOUNDED STEELE FROWNED BUT WAS PLEASED BY THE EFFECT OF THE BLACK IT WAS JUST THAT NOTE WHICH BROUGHT THE REST TOGETHER
THE LITTLE DEMONS ARE THE SOURCE OF AS MANY REPRIEVES CALAMITIES AND ANXIETIES AS THE BATTLE ITSELF SOMETIMES MISSUS BONHAM HAS JUST GONE OUT AT OTHERS SHE IS AT HOME
IF YOU GO TO HIS STUDIO HE'LL GIVE YOU ONE OF HIS PICTURES I SAY TEDDY HALF A JIFF SAID CRUTTENDON WHAT'S THE SEASON OF THE YEAR HE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW WE TAKE A DAY OFF ON SUNDAYS FLANDERS
IT'S THAT THAT'S NOT RIGHT SAID JINNY CARSLAKE NO SAID CRUTTENDON DECIDEDLY CAN'T BE DONE HE TOOK THE CANVAS OFF THE CHAIR AND STOOD IT ON THE FLOOR WITH ITS BACK TO THEM
ARCHER SAID MISSUS FLANDERS WITH THAT TENDERNESS WHICH MOTHERS SO OFTEN DISPLAY TOWARDS THEIR ELDEST SONS WILL BE AT GIBRALTAR TO MORROW THE POST FOR WHICH SHE WAS WAITING STROLLING UP DODS HILL WHILE THE RANDOM CHURCH BELLS SWUNG A HYMN TUNE ABOUT HER HEAD
THE WIND BLEW STRAIGHT DASHES OF RAIN ACROSS THE WINDOW WHICH FLASHED SILVER AS THEY PASSED THROUGH THE LIGHT A SINGLE LEAF TAPPED HURRIEDLY PERSISTENTLY UPON THE GLASS THERE WAS A HURRICANE OUT AT SEA ARCHER COULD NOT SLEEP MISSUS FLANDERS STOOPED OVER HIM
AND CRUTTENDON WAVING HIS HAND DISAPPEARED LIKE THE VERY GREAT GENIUS THAT HE WAS NO MISSUS FLANDERS WAS TOLD NONE OF THIS
THEY HAD CLIMBED THE DARK HILL AND REACHED THE ROMAN CAMP THE RAMPART ROSE AT THEIR FEET THE SMOOTH CIRCLE SURROUNDING THE CAMP OR THE GRAVE HOW MANY NEEDLES BETTY FLANDERS HAD LOST THERE AND HER GARNET BROOCH IT
SAID MISSUS FLANDERS STRAIGHTENING HER BACK I NEVER CARED FOR MISTER PARKER NEITHER DID I SAID MISSUS JARVIS THEY BEGAN TO WALK HOME BUT THEIR VOICES FLOATED FOR A LITTLE ABOVE THE CAMP
SAID BETTY FLANDERS YES JACOB WILL LEAVE PARIS ON WEDNESDAY JACOB WAS ALWAYS MY FRIEND OF THE THREE SAID MISSUS JARVIS NOW MY DEAR I AM GOING NO FURTHER SAID MISSUS FLANDERS
YOU NEEDN'T REPEAT THE WHOLE DAMNED THING OVER AGAIN CRUTTENDON SAID MALLINSON THE LITTLE BALD PAINTER WHO WAS SITTING AT A MARBLE TABLE SPLASHED WITH COFFEE AND RINGED WITH WINE TALKING VERY FAST
SCARBOROUGH MISSUS FLANDERS WROTE ON THE ENVELOPE AND DASHED A BOLD LINE BENEATH IT WAS HER NATIVE TOWN THE HUB OF THE UNIVERSE BUT A STAMP
DON'T GIVE MISTER MALLINSON ANY MORE WINE SAID CRUTTENDON FAIR PLAY FAIR PLAY SAID JACOB JUDICIALLY LET A MAN GET DRUNK IF HE LIKES THAT'S SHAKESPEARE CRUTTENDON I'M WITH YOU THERE
AS IF A WOMAN WEARING A DIAMOND NECKLACE TURNED HER HEAD THIS WAY AND THAT HOW QUIET IT IS SAID MISSUS JARVIS MISSUS FLANDERS RUBBED THE TURF WITH HER TOE THINKING OF HER GARNET BROOCH
NOW ELSBETH IS GOING TO SING AGAIN CLARA IS PLAYING HER ACCOMPANIMENT OR TURNING OVER FOR MISTER CARTER I THINK NO MISTER CARTER IS PLAYING BY HIMSELF THIS IS BACH SHE WHISPERED AS MISTER CARTER PLAYED THE FIRST BARS
YET IT WAS YEARS SINCE SHE HAD OPENED THE ORCHARD GATE AND GONE OUT ON DODS HILL AFTER DINNER IT IS PERFECTLY DRY SAID MISSUS JARVIS AS THEY SHUT THE ORCHARD DOOR AND STEPPED ON TO THE TURF I SHAN'T GO FAR
SQUEEZING OUT RAW SIENNA AND KEEPING HIS EYES FIXED ON BETTY FLANDERS'S BACK
A LIVE ENGLISH MATRON GROWING STOUT THE CLOCK STRUCK THE QUARTER THE FRAIL WAVES OF SOUND BROKE AMONG THE STIFF GORSE AND THE HAWTHORN TWIGS AS THE CHURCH CLOCK DIVIDED TIME INTO QUARTERS
I HAD ALL SHAKESPEARE BY HEART BEFORE I WAS IN MY TEENS MISTER SALVIN YOU DON'T SAY SO SAID MISTER SALVIN BUT I DO SAID LADY HIBBERT OH MISTER SALVIN I'M SO SORRY
THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE WELLINGTON NOSE BUT I COULD NEVER MARRY A MAN WITH A NOSE LIKE THAT SAID CLARA NONSENSE SAID MISSUS DURRANT BUT I AM TOO SEVERE SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF FOR CLARA LOSING ALL VIVACITY TORE UP HER DANCE PROGRAMME AND THREW IT IN THE FENDER
THEN HERE IS ANOTHER SCRAP OF CONVERSATION THE TIME ABOUT ELEVEN IN THE MORNING THE SCENE A STUDIO AND THE DAY SUNDAY I TELL YOU FLANDERS SAID CRUTTENDON
AND HE HAD TO SWERVE TO AVOID THEM AND THE GULLS ROSE IN FRONT OF HIM AND FLOATED OUT AND SETTLED AGAIN A LITTLE FARTHER ON A LARGE BLACK WOMAN WAS SITTING ON THE SAND HE RAN TOWARDS HER NANNY NANNY HE CRIED
WHO SHALL DENY THAT IN THESE RESPECTS EVERY WOMAN IS NICER THAN ANY MAN WELL BETTY FLANDERS TO BEGIN WITH SHE HAD HER HAND UPON THE GARDEN GATE THE MEAT SHE EXCLAIMED STRIKING THE LATCH DOWN
IT IS SURELY A GREAT DISCOVERY THAT LEADS TO THE UNION OF HEARTS AND FOUNDATION OF HOMES THE PAPER FLOWERS DID NO LESS IT MUST NOT BE THOUGHT THOUGH THAT THEY OUSTED THE FLOWERS OF NATURE
MISS JINNY CARSLAKE PALE FRECKLED MORBID CAME INTO THE ROOM OH JINNY HERE'S A FRIEND FLANDERS AN ENGLISHMAN WEALTHY HIGHLY CONNECTED GO ON FLANDERS JACOB SAID NOTHING
AND THE MAN STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AS IF HE WERE GOING TO HAVE A FIT EVERYBODY FEEDS THEM SAID JINNY WAVING THE PIGEONS AWAY THEY'RE STUPID OLD THINGS WELL I DON'T KNOW SAID JACOB SMOKING HIS CIGARETTE
WERE YOU THERE WHEN THEY ACTED MISTER WORTLEY'S PLAY OH NO OF COURSE NOT AT THE LAST MOMENT DID YOU HEAR YOU HAD TO GO TO JOIN YOUR MOTHER I REMEMBER AT HARROGATE AT THE LAST MOMENT AS I WAS SAYING JUST AS EVERYTHING WAS READY THE CLOTHES FINISHED AND EVERYTHING
THE CAT AND THE FIDDLE MALLINSON INTERRUPTED STRUMMING HIS FINGERS ON THE TABLE THE MOST EX QUI SITELY BEAUTIFUL THING IN THE WHOLE OF LITERATURE CRUTTENDON IS A VERY GOOD FELLOW HE REMARKED CONFIDENTIALLY BUT HE'S A BIT OF A FOOL
THE AMUSING THING SHE WENT ON ADDRESSING MISTER SALVIN WHO OWING TO HIS LAMENESS WAS ACCOMMODATED WITH A CHAIR THE AMUSING THING ABOUT A PARTY IS TO WATCH THE PEOPLE COMING AND GOING COMING AND GOING
IF I WERE BUT IN THIS GOOD KIND LOVING GENEROUS KING'S PALACE I SHOULD SOON BE SUCH A GREAT LADY AS THEY NEVER SAW THEN THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT A GOOD LITTLE GIRL I HAD ALWAYS BEEN
SHE WOULD SEE WHETHER SHE COULD NOT WALK OUT OF THE STRANGE LUMINOUS DUSK THAT SURROUNDED HER WALK SHE FOUND SHE COULD WELL ENOUGH BUT WALK OUT SHE COULD NOT ON AND ON SHE WENT
HER COMMONPLACE SPEECHES WERE SAID OVER AGAIN AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THE FINEST POETRY AND THE PRETTY WAYS WHICH EVERY MODERATELY GOOD CHILD HAS WERE EXTOLLED AS IF THE RESULT OF HER EXCELLENT TASTE AND THE CHOICE OF HER JUDGMENT AND WILL
CAME GENTLY TROTTING THE LOVELIEST LITTLE SNOW WHITE PONY WITH GREAT SHINING BLUE WINGS HALF LIFTED FROM HIS SHOULDERS STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE LITTLE GIRL NEITHER HURRYING NOR LINGERING
AS SHE SPOKE SHE STROKED THE LITTLE GIRL'S BARE FEET WHICH WERE BY HER HALF BURIED IN THE SOFT MOSS AND AS SHE ENDED SHE LAID HER CHEEK ON THEM AND KISSED THEM
THEN IN HER TERROR THE PRINCESS GREW ANGRY AND SAYING TO HERSELF SHE MUST BE SOMEWHERE IN THE PLACE ELSE WHO WAS THERE TO OPEN THE DOOR TO ME
SHE WAS IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN FULL OF BLOSSOMING TREES AND THE LOVELIEST ROSES AND LILIES A LAKE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WITH A TINY BOAT SO DELIGHTFUL WAS IT THAT ROSAMOND FORGOT ALL
SHUT THE DOOR AND LEFT HER ALONE ROSAMOND WAS SOBBING SO THAT SHE DID NOT HEAR HER GO WHEN AT LENGTH SHE LOOKED UP AND SAW THAT THE WISE WOMAN WAS GONE HER MISERY RETURNED AFRESH AND TENFOLD AND SHE WEPT AND WAILED
I SHALL GO AND LOOK AT THE PICTURE AGAIN IF IT BE A PICTURE AS SOON AS I'VE GOT MY CLOTHES ON THE WORK CAN WAIT IT'S NOT MY WORK IT'S THE OLD WITCH'S AND SHE OUGHT TO DO IT HERSELF
THE FIRE BURNED BRIGHTLY AND ON THE TABLE WERE MANY OF HER WONDERFUL TOYS ON WHICH HOWEVER SHE NOW LOOKED WITH SOME CONTEMPT
BUT TO HER SURPRISE SHE CAME ONLY TO ANOTHER BACK FOR NO DOOR WAS TO BE SEEN SHE TRIED THE FARTHER END BUT STILL NO DOOR SHE MUST HAVE PASSED IT AS SHE RAN BUT NO NEITHER IN GABLE NOR IN SIDE WAS ANY TO BE FOUND
THEN AGNES THOUGHT SHE WAS MOCKING HER AND SAID YOU ARE UGLY AND THE LITTLE GIRL SAID YOU ARE UGLY THEN AGNES LOST HER TEMPER AND PUT OUT HER HANDS TO SEIZE THE LITTLE GIRL BUT LO
AND NOW A STRANGE THING TOOK PLACE IN PROPORTION AS THE OTHER TO THE EYES OF HER MIND RECEDED INTO THE BACKGROUND THIS TO HER PRESENT BODILY EYES APPEARED TO COME FORWARD AND ASSUME REALITY
IT WAS LIKE A PRIMROSE TRYING TO EXPRESS DOUBT INSTEAD OF CONFIDENCE IT SEEMED TO PUT HER HALF IN MIND OF SOMETHING AND SHE FELT AS IF SHAME WERE COMING
SEEMED EVER BROODING OVER HER ALL AT ONCE ON THE THIRD DAY SHE WAS AWARE THAT A NAKED CHILD WAS SEATED BESIDE HER BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THE CHILD THAT MADE HER SHUDDER SHE NEVER LOOKED AT AGNES
WHEN SHE CAME NEAR IT SHE SAW THAT THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND RAN STRAIGHT INTO THE OUTSTRETCHED ARMS OF THE WISE WOMAN THE WISE WOMAN KISSED HER AND STROKED HER HAIR SET HER DOWN BY THE FIRE
WHICH THREW HER FLAT ON THE GRASS AND TROTTING BACK TO HIS MISTRESS BENT DOWN HIS HEAD BEFORE HER AS IF ASKING EXCUSE FOR RIDDING HIMSELF OF THE UNBEARABLE THE PRINCESS
THAT IS UP INTO HER FACE WHICH IS THE SURFACE OF THE MIND ERE IT HAD TIME TO SINK DOWN AGAIN THE WISE WOMAN CAUGHT UP THE LITTLE MIRROR AND HELD IT BEFORE HER AGNES SAW HER SOMEBODY
GAZING AT THE CHILD DID YOU NEVER SEE ME BEFORE ROSAMOND SHE ASKED NO NEVER ANSWERED THE PRINCESS I NEVER SAW ANY THING HALF SO LOVELY LOOK AT ME
BUT THE RABBIT LOOKED VERY LIMP AND ODD
BUT IT WAS FAR DEEPER THAN IT LOOKED AND SHE COULD NOT NEITHER COULD SHE GET HER EYES TO LEAVE THE WHITE FACE ITS EYES FASCINATED AND FIXED HERS AND THERE SHE LAY LEANING OVER THE BOAT
SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE BED AND TAKING ROSAMOND IN HER ARMS SAT DOWN WITH HER BY THE FIRE MY POOR CHILD SHE SAID TWO TERRIBLE FAILURES AND THE MORE THE HARDER
ON AND ON SHE CARRIED HER WITHOUT A WORD SHE KNEW THAT IF SHE SET HER DOWN SHE WOULD NEVER RUN AFTER HER LIKE THE PRINCESS AT LEAST NOT BEFORE THE EVIL THING WAS ALREADY UPON HER ON AND ON SHE WENT NEVER HALTING
IF THE WOMAN WAS ANY THING SHORT OF AN OGRESS HER COTTAGE MUST BE BETTER THAN THAT HORRIBLE LONELINESS WITH NOTHING IN ALL THE WORLD BUT A STARE AND EVEN AN OGRESS HAD AT LEAST THE SHAPE AND LOOK OF A HUMAN BEING
THAT SHE JUMPED UP AND HURRIED ABOUT THE COTTAGE WITH OUTSTRETCHED ARMS TRYING TO FIND THE WISE WOMAN BUT BEING IN A BAD TEMPER ALWAYS MAKES PEOPLE STUPID AND PRESENTLY SHE STRUCK HER FOREHEAD SUCH A BLOW AGAINST SOMETHING
YET AGAIN SHE LED HER TO THE SAME DOOR AND SEEMED TO THE PRINCESS TO SEND HER YET AGAIN ALONE INTO THE ROOM SHE WAS IN A FOREST A PLACE HALF WILD HALF TENDED
ASKED ROSAMOND LOOKING ALL ABOUT HERE SAID THE LADY AND ROSAMOND LOOKING AGAIN SAW THE WISE WOMAN FOLDED AS USUAL IN HER LONG DARK CLOAK AND IT WAS YOU ALL THE TIME
WITH HER LAP FULL OF FLOWERS OF ALL COLORS BUT OF SUCH KINDS AS ROSAMOND HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SHE WAS PLAYING WITH THEM BURYING HER HANDS IN THEM TUMBLING THEM ABOUT AND EVERY NOW AND THEN PICKING ONE FROM THE REST AND THROWING IT AWAY
THE NEXT MOMENT SHE REMOVED IT FROM HER FACE AND ROSAMOND BEHELD NOT HER NURSE BUT THE WISE WOMAN STANDING ON HER OWN HEARTH WHILE SHE HERSELF STOOD BY THE DOOR
WHICH NO BAD THING COULD STEP UPON AND LIVE WITH THE FIRST PEEP OF THE SUN ABOVE THE HORIZON SHE SAW THE LITTLE COTTAGE BEFORE HER
SHE WENT TOWARDS THE DOOR YOUR QUEEN MAMMA PRINCESS CANNOT SEE YOU NOW SAID HER NURSE I HAVE YET TO LEARN THAT IT IS MY PART TO TAKE ORDERS FROM A SERVANT SAID THE PRINCESS WITH TEMPER AND DIGNITY
MORNING CAME AND THEY HAD NOT FOUND HER THEN THE WHOLE COUNTRY SIDE AROSE TO SEARCH FOR THE MISSING AGNES BUT DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT PASSED AND NOTHING WAS DISCOVERED OF OR CONCERNING HER
AND BEING STILL THE SAME MISERABLE CREATURE AS BEFORE
AND YOU WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT SHE ROSE AND TOOK HER BY THE HAND THE PRINCESS TREMBLED A LITTLE BUT NEVER THOUGHT OF RESISTING THE WISE WOMAN LED HER INTO THE GREAT HALL WITH THE PICTURES
SO THAT ON THE WHOLE OF TWO VERY UNPLEASANT CREATURES I WOULD SAY THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WORSE HAD NOT THE SHEPHERD'S BEEN QUITE AS BAD BUT AS I HAVE SAID
WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE OR RATHER TRIED TO DO HAD NOT PEGGY'S TAIL STRUCK HER DOWN WITH SUCH FORCE THAT FOR A MOMENT SHE COULD NOT RISE I CANNOT TELL BUT
THAT THEREFORE YOU ARE CAPABLE OF SEEING ME AT ALL TIMES NO THERE ARE MANY THINGS IN YOU YET THAT MUST BE CHANGED BEFORE THAT CAN BE NOW HOWEVER YOU WILL SEEK ME
DEAR PRINCESS SAID THE LITTLE GIRL THE FLOWERS WILL NOT ALWAYS WITHER AT YOUR TOUCH TRY NOW ONLY DO NOT PLUCK IT FLOWERS OUGHT NEVER TO BE PLUCKED EXCEPT TO GIVE AWAY
MEANTIME THE WISE WOMAN WAS BUSY AS SHE ALWAYS WAS AND HER BUSINESS NOW WAS WITH THE CHILD OF THE SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERDESS AWAY IN THE NORTH HER NAME WAS AGNES HER FATHER AND MOTHER WERE POOR AND COULD NOT GIVE HER MANY THINGS
AND SAY TO YOURSELF OH THIS IS REALLY NOTHING TO ME IT MAY BE A TRIAL TO SOME BUT FOR ME I AM SURE IT IS NOT WORTH MENTIONING AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT WILL BE UPON YOU
IF I SAY IT JUST COMES TO THIS THAT YOU MUST NOT DO WHAT IS WRONG HOWEVER MUCH YOU ARE INCLINED TO DO IT AND YOU MUST DO WHAT IS RIGHT
AND HAVE HER PUNISHED FOR NOT TAKING ME TO THE PALACE ONE OF HIS POOR LOST CHILDREN HE IS SO FOND OF I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HER UGLY OLD HEAD CUT OFF ANYHOW I WILL TRY MY LUCK WITHOUT ASKING HER LEAVE
SHE IS ALONE WITH HER MOST INTIMATE FRIEND THE PRINCESS OF THE FROZEN REGIONS
TO WHICH THE PRIVATE ENDS OF MAN MUST FOR THE MOST PART BE POSTPONED FOR AS REASON IS NOT COMPETENT TO GUIDE THE WILL WITH CERTAINTY IN REGARD TO ITS OBJECTS AND THE SATISFACTION OF ALL OUR WANTS
THE UNCONDITIONAL PRACTICAL NECESSITY WHICH IS THEREBY IMPOSED ON THEM IS LOST WHEN THEIR FOUNDATION IS TAKEN FROM THE PARTICULAR CONSTITUTION OF HUMAN NATURE
WHETHER BY IMMEDIATE INCLINATION OR BY ANY SATISFACTION INDIRECTLY GAINED THROUGH REASON BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE A MAXIM WHICH EXCLUDES IT CANNOT BE COMPREHENDED AS A UNIVERSAL LAW IN ONE AND THE SAME VOLITION
OF INDEPENDENCE ON DETERMINING CAUSES OF THE WORLD OF SENSE AND FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW HE IS CONSCIOUS OF A GOOD WILL WHICH BY HIS OWN CONFESSION CONSTITUTES THE LAW
NAY ARE EVEN REPELLED BY A NATURAL AND UNCONQUERABLE AVERSION THIS IS PRACTICAL LOVE AND NOT PATHOLOGICAL A LOVE WHICH IS SEATED IN THE WILL AND NOT IN THE PROPENSIONS OF SENSE IN PRINCIPLES OF ACTION
THE AUTONOMY OF THE WILL AS THE SUPREME PRINCIPLE OF MORALITY AUTONOMY OF THE WILL IS THAT PROPERTY OF IT BY WHICH IT IS A LAW TO ITSELF INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY PROPERTY OF THE OBJECTS OF VOLITION
WHEREAS ON THE CONTRARY ALL LAWS THAT REFER TO A DEFINITE OBJECT GIVE HETERONOMY WHICH ONLY BELONGS TO LAWS OF NATURE AND CAN ONLY APPLY TO THE SENSIBLE WORLD BUT REASON WOULD OVERSTEP ALL ITS BOUNDS IF IT UNDERTOOK TO EXPLAIN HOW PURE REASON CAN BE PRACTICAL WHICH WOULD BE EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM
AS IN THE PRINCIPLE OF PERFECTION IN EITHER CASE THE WILL NEVER DETERMINES ITSELF IMMEDIATELY BY THE CONCEPTION OF THE ACTION BUT ONLY BY THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE FORESEEN EFFECT OF THE ACTION HAS ON THE WILL I OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING
AND OBEYING THOSE ONLY WHICH HE HIMSELF GIVES AND BY WHICH HIS MAXIMS CAN BELONG TO A SYSTEM OF UNIVERSAL LAW TO WHICH AT THE SAME TIME HE SUBMITS HIMSELF FOR NOTHING HAS ANY WORTH EXCEPT WHAT THE LAW ASSIGNS IT
IN CONTRAST WITH EVERY OTHER WHICH I ACCORDINGLY RECKON AS HETERONOMY THE CONCEPTION OF THE WILL OF EVERY RATIONAL BEING AS ONE WHICH MUST CONSIDER ITSELF AS GIVING IN ALL THE MAXIMS OF ITS WILL
AND ALWAYS HAS IN VIEW THE PRINCIPLE HERE SUGGESTED LET THE QUESTION BE FOR EXAMPLE MAY I WHEN IN DISTRESS MAKE A PROMISE WITH THE INTENTION NOT TO KEEP IT I READILY DISTINGUISH HERE BETWEEN THE TWO SIGNIFICATIONS
RATIONAL NATURE IS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE REST OF NATURE BY THIS THAT IT SETS BEFORE ITSELF AN END THIS END WOULD BE THE MATTER OF EVERY GOOD WILL BUT SINCE IN THE IDEA OF A WILL
AS BEING PART AND PARCEL OF NATURE IT MUST THEREFORE SHOW THAT NOT ONLY CAN BOTH THESE VERY WELL CO EXIST BUT THAT BOTH MUST BE THOUGHT AS NECESSARILY UNITED IN THE SAME SUBJECT SINCE OTHERWISE NO REASON COULD BE GIVEN WHY WE SHOULD BURDEN REASON WITH AN IDEA WHICH
TO THESE QUESTIONS WE COULD GIVE NO SATISFACTORY ANSWER WE FIND INDEED SOMETIMES THAT WE CAN TAKE AN INTEREST IN A PERSONAL QUALITY WHICH DOES NOT INVOLVE ANY INTEREST OF EXTERNAL CONDITION PROVIDED THIS QUALITY MAKES US CAPABLE OF PARTICIPATING IN THE CONDITION IN CASE
FOR IN THIS CASE WE CAN READILY DISTINGUISH WHETHER THE ACTION WHICH AGREES WITH DUTY IS DONE FROM DUTY OR FROM A SELFISH VIEW
BUT IT DOES NOT IN THE LEAST AUTHORIZE US TO THINK OF IT FURTHER THAN AS TO ITS FORMAL CONDITION ONLY THAT IS THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE MAXIMS OF THE WILL AS LAWS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE AUTONOMY OF THE LATTER WHICH ALONE IS CONSISTENT WITH ITS FREEDOM
THERE ARISES FROM THIS A DIALECTIC OF REASON
HE SEES THEN THAT A SYSTEM OF NATURE COULD INDEED SUBSIST WITH SUCH A UNIVERSAL LAW ALTHOUGH MEN
AND IS GOOD WITHOUT A VIEW TO ANYTHING FURTHER A NOTION WHICH EXISTS ALREADY IN THE SOUND NATURAL UNDERSTANDING REQUIRING RATHER TO BE CLEARED UP THAN TO BE TAUGHT AND WHICH IN ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF OUR ACTIONS
REASON WERE TO EFFECT THE ALLOTMENT THAT IS TO SAY THE MERE BEING WORTHY OF HAPPINESS CAN INTEREST OF ITSELF
IT IS NOT ENOUGH THEN TO PROVE IT FROM CERTAIN SUPPOSED EXPERIENCES OF HUMAN NATURE
WE CAN COME NO NEARER TO THEM NOR CAN WE EVER KNOW WHAT THEY ARE IN THEMSELVES THIS MUST FURNISH A DISTINCTION HOWEVER CRUDE BETWEEN A WORLD OF SENSE AND THE WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING
WHICH COULD NOT WITHOUT CONTRADICTION BE ALSO A UNIVERSAL LAW AND ACCORDINGLY ALWAYS SO TO ACT THAT THE WILL COULD AT THE SAME TIME REGARD ITSELF AS GIVING IN ITS MAXIMS UNIVERSAL LAWS IF NOW
THIS SUPPOSES THE POSSIBILITY OF A SYNTHETIC USE
INCLINATION AND TASTE OR THE UNDERSTANDING AND REASON THE EMPLOYMENT OF WHICH IS BY THE PECULIAR CONSTITUTION OF THEIR NATURE ATTENDED WITH SATISFACTION IT FOLLOWS THAT THE LAW WOULD BE PROPERLY SPEAKING
ONLY BY THE LAWS OF EFFICIENT CAUSES ACTING UNDER NECESSITATION FROM WITHOUT NEVERTHELESS ALTHOUGH THE SYSTEM OF NATURE IS LOOKED UPON AS A MACHINE YET SO FAR AS IT HAS REFERENCE TO RATIONAL BEINGS AS ITS ENDS
THE SPECIFIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VIRTUE AND VICE BEING ENTIRELY EXTINGUISHED ON THE OTHER HAND AS TO MORAL FEELING THIS SUPPOSED SPECIAL SENSE THE APPEAL TO IT IS INDEED SUPERFICIAL WHEN THOSE WHO CANNOT THINK
IF HE SUPPOSED TO BE AN UPRIGHT MAN IS BY TEMPERAMENT COLD AND INDIFFERENT TO THE SUFFERINGS OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE IN RESPECT OF HIS OWN
AND NOT RUN THE RISK OF LOSING ALL GENUINE MORAL PRINCIPLES THROUGH THE EQUIVOCATION INTO WHICH IT EASILY FALLS THUS WHEN PRACTICAL REASON CULTIVATES ITSELF THERE INSENSIBLY ARISES IN IT
IT ONLY DEMANDS FROM SPECULATIVE REASON THAT IT SHOULD PUT AN END TO THE DISCORD IN WHICH IT ENTANGLES ITSELF IN THEORETICAL QUESTIONS SO THAT PRACTICAL REASON MAY HAVE REST AND SECURITY FROM EXTERNAL ATTACKS WHICH MIGHT MAKE THE GROUND DEBATABLE ON WHICH IT DESIRES TO BUILD
BY A KINGDOM I UNDERSTAND THE UNION OF DIFFERENT RATIONAL BEINGS IN A SYSTEM BY COMMON LAWS NOW SINCE IT IS BY LAWS THAT ENDS ARE DETERMINED AS REGARDS THEIR UNIVERSAL VALIDITY HENCE
FOR ONE OF THESE THEORIES BECAUSE THEIR HEARERS WOULD NOT TOLERATE SUSPENSION OF JUDGEMENT BUT WHAT INTERESTS US MORE HERE
OF WHAT ON SUPPOSITION OF FREEDOM ARE CONCEIVED AS ITS NECESSARY CONSEQUENCES ON THE OTHER SIDE IT IS EQUALLY NECESSARY THAT EVERYTHING THAT TAKES PLACE SHOULD BE FIXEDLY DETERMINED ACCORDING TO LAWS OF NATURE THIS NECESSITY OF NATURE IS LIKEWISE NOT AN EMPIRICAL CONCEPTION
THAT SERVES THE WILL AS ITS PRINCIPLE AND MUST SO SERVE IT IF DUTY IS NOT TO BE A VAIN DELUSION AND A CHIMERICAL NOTION THE COMMON REASON OF MEN IN ITS PRACTICAL JUDGEMENTS PERFECTLY COINCIDES WITH THIS
IT IS CLEAR FROM WHAT PRECEDES THAT THE PURPOSES WHICH WE MAY HAVE IN VIEW IN OUR ACTIONS OR THEIR EFFECTS REGARDED AS ENDS AND SPRINGS OF THE WILL CANNOT GIVE TO ACTIONS ANY UNCONDITIONAL OR MORAL WORTH
IT FOLLOWS THAT FOR US MEN IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN HOW AND WHY THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE MAXIM AS A LAW THAT IS MORALITY INTERESTS THIS ONLY IS CERTAIN THAT IT IS NOT BECAUSE IT INTERESTS US THAT IT HAS VALIDITY FOR US FOR
THAT IS TO SAY ALL LAWS WHICH ARE INSEPARABLY CONNECTED WITH FREEDOM HAVE THE SAME FORCE FOR HIM AS IF HIS WILL HAD BEEN SHOWN TO BE FREE IN ITSELF BY A PROOF THEORETICALLY CONCLUSIVE NOW I AFFIRM
WHICH CONTAINS THIS LAW IN THE IDEA OF FREEDOM AND THEREFORE AS SUBJECT TO THE AUTONOMY OF THE WILL CONSEQUENTLY I MUST REGARD THE LAWS OF THE WORLD OF UNDERSTANDING AS IMPERATIVES FOR ME AND THE ACTIONS WHICH CONFORM TO THEM AS DUTIES AND THUS WHAT MAKES CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVES POSSIBLE IS THIS
FORMAL PRINCIPLE OF VOLITION WHEN AN ACTION IS DONE FROM DUTY IN WHICH CASE EVERY MATERIAL PRINCIPLE HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM IT THE THIRD PROPOSITION WHICH IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE TWO PRECEDING I WOULD EXPRESS THUS
IN WHICH WE SHOW OUR OWN ACTIVITY THEN IT FOLLOWS OF ITSELF THAT WE MUST ADMIT AND ASSUME BEHIND THE APPEARANCE SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS NOT AN APPEARANCE NAMELY THE THINGS IN THEMSELVES ALTHOUGH WE MUST ADMIT THAT AS THEY CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO US EXCEPT AS THEY AFFECT US
IS ITSELF THE ONLY LAW WHICH THE WILL OF EVERY RATIONAL BEING IMPOSES ON ITSELF WITHOUT NEEDING TO ASSUME ANY SPRING OR INTEREST AS A FOUNDATION
BY THE CONSTANT INQUIRY FOR THE CONDITION THE SATISFACTION OF REASON IS ONLY FURTHER AND FURTHER POSTPONED
WHICH IS TO DETERMINE THE WILL THERE THE RULE IS SIMPLY HETERONOMY THE IMPERATIVE IS CONDITIONAL NAMELY IF OR BECAUSE ONE WISHES FOR THIS OBJECT ONE SHOULD ACT SO AND SO HENCE IT CAN NEVER COMMAND MORALLY
CORRESPONDS TO A CERTAIN TASTE THAT IS TO A SATISFACTION IN THE MERE PURPOSELESS PLAY OF OUR FACULTIES HAS A FANCY VALUE BUT THAT WHICH CONSTITUTES THE CONDITION UNDER WHICH ALONE ANYTHING CAN BE AN END IN ITSELF
AND YET PRESERVES HIS LIFE WITHOUT LOVING IT NOT FROM INCLINATION OR FEAR BUT FROM DUTY THEN HIS MAXIM HAS A MORAL WORTH TO BE BENEFICENT WHEN WE CAN IS A DUTY AND BESIDES THIS
ESTRALLA HAD HIDDEN HERSELF BEHIND SOME SHRUBBERY AND JOINED SYLVIA AT THE GATE WOULD HE HIRE ME OUT MISSY SHE ASKED EAGERLY MY NO ANSWERED SYLVIA AND BEFORE SHE COULD EXPLAIN THE GENEROSITY OF ESTRALLA'S OWNER
IT WAS DECIDED THAT RALPH AND PHILIP SHOULD RIDE BACK TO CHARLESTON THAT AFTERNOON WHEN UNCLE CHRIS DROVE THE LITTLE VISITORS HOME AND THAT FLORA SHOULD STAY AT THE PLANTATION WITH HER MOTHER FOR A DAY OR TWO SYLVIA HAD ENJOYED HER VISIT
BUT ON THIS MORNING IN EARLY OCTOBER THEY WERE ALLOWED TO GO BY THEMSELVES AS THEY WALKED ALONG THEY COULD LOOK OUT ACROSS THE BLUE HARBOR AND SEE SAILING VESSELS AND ROWBOATS COMING AND GOING IN THE DISTANCE WERE THE THREE FORTS WHOSE HISTORIC NAMES WERE KNOWN TO EVERY CHILD IN CHARLESTON
GRACE WAS READY TO START FOR SCHOOL WHEN SYLVIA AND ESTRALLA ARRIVED AND HER MOTHER GAVE HER CONSENT AT ONCE FOR HER TO GO SAILING IN THE AFTERNOON THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS WILL SOON BE HERE SO A HALF DAY OUT OF SCHOOL WILL NOT MATTER MISSUS WAITE SAID SMILINGLY
SPEAKING VERY SLOWLY I THINK MISTER ROBERT WAITE IS JUST LIKE THE KNIGHTS IN THAT BOOK THE AGE OF CHIVALRY THEY ALWAYS DID EXACTLY WHAT WAS RIGHT
SYLVIA WAS THE FIRST ONE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE THE NEXT MORNING AND WAS DELIGHTED WHEN HER MOTHER SAID THAT SHE AND MISSUS CARLETON WERE INVITED TO LUNCHEON AT THE HOUSE OF A FRIEND AUNT CONNIE AND ESTRALLA WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOU MISSUS FULTON ADDED AND SYLVIA FELT HER FACE FLUSH
NOT UNTIL THEY WERE READY TO LAND AT THE FORT DID HE REMEMBER HIS LITTLE FRIEND HE WENT DOWN TO THE CABIN AND FOUND SYLVIA FAST ASLEEP POOR LITTLE YANKEE
THERE HAD BEEN MANY CHANGES AT FORT MOULTRIE SINCE SYLVIA'S LAST VISIT A DEEP DITCH HAD BEEN DUG BETWEEN THE FORT AND THE SAND BARS AND MANY WORKMEN WERE BUSY IN STRENGTHENING THE DEFENCES AND SYLVIA AND GRACE WONDERED WHY SO MANY SOLDIERS WERE STATIONED ALONG THE PARAPET
SHE CLIMBED A SMALL SAND HILL COVERED WITH STUNTED LITTLE TREES AND LOOKED ABOUT BUT COULD SEE NO TRACE OF THE LITTLE DARKY IT HAD NOT OCCURRED TO SYLVIA THAT ESTRALLA WOULD GO BACK TO THE FORT
PEOPLE WOULD RUN AFTER HER COACH JUST TO LOOK AT HER AND FLORA LOOKED AT HER COMPANIONS EXPECTANTLY QUITE FORGETTING THAT SHE HAD TOLD THEM THE STORY BEFORE OH FLORA EVERY TIME I COME OUT HERE YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR WONDERFUL GREAT GRAND MOTHER SAID GRACE
THEN SHE PULLED AT THE HEAVY DOOR AND IT SWUNG BACK EASILY
WHOSE RED FACE AND WHITE WHISKERS MADE HER THINK OF THE PICTURES OF SANTA CLAUS WON'T YOU BE SEATED YOUNG LADY HE SAID VERY POLITELY WAVING HIS HAND TOWARD A LOW CUSHIONED CHAIR AND BOWING AS IF I WERE REALLY GROWN UP THOUGHT SYLVIA
AND I'LL KEEP ON TO MISTER ROBERT WAITE'S AND HAVE IT ALL SETTLED THIS MORNING SYLVIA REPLIED PUTTING ON HER PRETTY NEW HAT YOU MAY COME TOO SHE ADDED
SCHOOL HAD OPENED THE PREVIOUS WEEK AND SYLVIA HAD BEGUN TO FEEL QUITE AT HOME WITH HER NEW SCHOOLMATES THE WINTER BEFORE MISSUS FULTON HAD TAUGHT HER LITTLE DAUGHTER AT HOME
SO THAT SYLVIA WAS NOT QUESTIONED THAT NIGHT IN REGARD TO HER DISAPPEARANCE FROM MISS PATTEN'S GRACE KNEW NOTHING OF SYLVIA'S ENCOUNTER WITH ELINOR MAYHEW SO NO ONE COULD IMAGINE WHY SHE HAD STARTED FOR HOME WITHOUT A WORD TO MISS PATTEN
MY MOTHER IS GOING TO WRITE AND ASK YOUR MOTHERS IF THEY WILL GIVE ME THE PLEASURE OF YOUR COMPANY I AM SURE I CAN COME DECLARED GRACE AND I THINK IT'S LOVELY OF YOU TO ASK ME
SHE WAS ALWAYS QUITE READY TO SMILE BUT SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY SYLVIA HAD WANTED HER TO COME SO MYSTERIOUSLY TO HER ROOM AND I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU TO READ AND WRITE SYLVIA ADDED IS YOU MISSY
I KNOWS JES HOW SLAVES ARE KETCHED YAS'M I DOES MY MAMMY TOLE ME
IT SEEMED TO SYLVIA THAT HER FATHER HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT HER HE WAS LOOKING STRAIGHT OUT OF THE WINDOW WHILE HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN HIS LITTLE GIRL
BUT SHE SAID THAT FLORA WAS NOT WELL AND THAT MAMMY WOULD TAKE HER BREAKFAST TO HER UP STAIRS AFTER BREAKFAST YOU MUST GO UP AND STAY WITH HER A LITTLE WHILE SAID MISSUS HAYES WHY FLORA WAS NEVER ILL IN HER LIFE DECLARED RALPH WHAT'S THE MATTER
SHE THOUGHT IT PROBABLE THAT THE LITTLE NORTHERN GIRL DID NOT REALIZE THE RULES OF THE SCHOOL HAD BECOME TIRED AND SO STARTED FOR HOME DID MISS SYLVIA SAY ANYTHING TO ANY OF YOU YOUNG LADIES ABOUT LEAVING THE GROUNDS
BUT IT HAPPENED THAT UNCLE PETER HAD BEEN SENT ON AN ERRAND TO A DISTANT PART OF THE TOWN AND BEFORE HE RETURNED THE BUTTERFLY WAS WELL DOWN THE HARBOR ONCE OR TWICE A GUARD BOAT PASSED THEM CLOSELY ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE ONLY TWO COLORED CHILDREN IN THE BOAT
YES INDEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ASKING ME REPLIED SYLVIA SHE HAD VISITED THE HAYES PLANTATION EARLY IN THE SUMMER AND THOUGHT IT A MORE WONDERFUL PLACE EVEN THAN THE BIG MANSION ON TRADD STREET
SHE WAS NOT AT ALL AFRAID NOR DID SHE RESIST WE OUGHT TO MAKE HER TAKE IT BACK SAID MAY BAILEY AS ELINOR STOPPED AND THEY ALL STOOD IN A CLOSE GROUP ABOUT SYLVIA
TWENTY DOLLARS WAS A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY SHE REFLECTED IF THE NORTHERN SOLDIERS WOULD ONLY COME QUICKLY AND SET THE SLAVES FREE BUT EVEN IF THEY DID NOT COME FOR A LONG TIME THE MONEY WOULD SURELY PAY MISTER WAITE WAGES FOR ESTRALLA SO THAT HE WOULD NOT INSIST ON SELLING HER
THE LITTLE DARKY WAS WAILING AND SOBBING I KNOWED I'D BE SOLD I KNOWED IT KEEP STILL ESTRALLA MISTER WAITE SAYS I MAY HAVE YOU WITHOUT PAYING HIM JUST AS LONG AS I LIVE IN HIS HOUSE HE SAID YOU WERE TO BE MY MAID OH ESTRALLA
FOR ELINOR HAD LET GO OF HER SO SUDDENLY THAT SHE HAD FALLEN FORWARD HER KNEES WERE HURT AND ONE OF HER HANDS WAS BRUISED BY THE FALL FOR A MOMENT SHE LAY SOBBING QUIETLY SHE WAS ANGRY AND MISERABLE
COME UP TO MY ROOM GIRLS AND REST UNTIL IT'S TIME TO DRESS FOR SUPPER SAID FLORA FLORA'S ROOM WAS JUST ACROSS THE HALL FROM THE ONE WHERE GRACE AND SYLVIA WERE TO SLEEP INSTEAD OF A SMALL WHITE BED LIKE THEIRS THERE WAS A BIG BED OF DARK MAHOGANY
A FEW MOMENTS AFTER SYLVIA STARTED TO FIND ESTRALLA MISSUS CARLETON HAD BEEN CALLED TO A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE TELL SYLVIA I WON'T BE GONE LONG SHE HAD SAID TO GRACE GRACE DID NOT MIND BEING ALONE UNTIL SYLVIA RETURNED
WHERE THE HAYES FAMILY LIVED IN THE WINTER MONTHS MISTER HAYES OWNED HUNDREDS OF NEGROES AND RAISED A GREAT QUANTITY OF COTTON THE HOUSE AT THE PLANTATION WAS LARGE WITH MANY BALCONIES AND COOL PLEASANT ROOMS
SHE KNEW OF NO REASON WHY THESE GIRLS SHOULD TREAT HER IN SO UNKIND A FASHION SHE FELT VERY DESOLATE AND UNHAPPY BUT SHE FACED THEM BRAVELY YANKEES YANKEES IT'S WHAT ALL AMERICANS ARE SHE DECLARED DEFIANTLY
GRACE LOOKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND THEN CLOSED THE DOOR NOT SEEING A LITTLE FIGURE CROUCHING IN A SHADOWY CORNER I WOULDN'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE TO HEAR IT'S ABOUT THE GHOST SHE WHISPERED I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
YOU ARE AT FORT SUMTER AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT HE ANSWERED I FORGOT ALL ABOUT YOU UNTIL WE WERE NEARLY HERE BUT ONE OF MY MEN IS GOING TO SAIL YOU SAFELY HOME WHAT'S THIS HE ADDED AS ESTRALLA APPEARED BY SYLVIA'S SIDE
GREATLY TO THE ADMIRATION OF THE SENTRY ON GUARD MISTER FULTON AND SYLVIA WENT DIRECTLY TO THE OFFICER'S QUARTERS WHICH WERE IN THE REAR OF THE FORT AND WHERE MISSUS CARLETON GAVE SYLVIA A WARM WELCOME SHE ASKED THE LITTLE GIRL ABOUT HER SCHOOL
THANK YOU GRACE I WILL START BACK TO THE FORT AS SOON AS I HAVE TALKED WITH SYLVIA'S MOTHER BUT ON MISTER FULTON'S RETURN TO THE WHARF HE FOUND A SENTRY ON GUARD WHO REFUSED HIM PERMISSION TO GO TO THE FORT
IT WAS RATHER DIFFICULT WALKING HER FEET SLIPPED IN THE SAND AND AFTER A LITTLE SYLVIA DECIDED NOT TO FOLLOW THE SHORE BUT TO CLIMB BACK OVER THE SAND HILLS A COLD WIND WAS NOW BLOWING FROM THE WATER
SHE DARED NOT LOOK AT THE OTHER GIRLS SHE HELD A BOOK BEFORE HER FACE AND ONLY HOPED THAT SHE COULD KEEP BACK THE TEARS UNTIL RECESS TIME
HE TORE IT INTO A GREAT MANY SMALL PIECES THEN HE PUT THE ENCLOSED ENVELOPE CAREFULLY IN AN INNER POCKET SO YOU BROUGHT ME THIS LETTER FROM THE FORT WELL YOU HAVE DONE WHAT I HOPE MAY PROVE A GREAT SERVICE TO THE STARS AND STRIPES
MAMMY SHE SCREAMED LYING FACE DOWNWARD ON THE FLOOR WITH THE OVERTURNED FOOTSTOOL AND BROKEN PITCHER WHILE THE STEAMING WATER SOAKED THROUGH THE COTTON DRESS IN A MOMENT SYLVIA WAS OUT OF BED GET UP ESTRALLA SHE COMMANDED
SHE WAS AS SURE THAT ALL WOULD BE WELL NOW AS SHE HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED AND DESPONDENT WHEN SHE ENTERED THE ROOM SHALL I TELL MY MAMMY SHE ASKED EAGERLY YES SYLVIA RESPONDED I KNOW MY MOTHER WILL LET ME
BUT I COULD GO SLEIGHING RESPONDED SYLVIA AS THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF FLORA'S HOME THEY BOTH EXCLAIMED IN SURPRISE WHY THEY ARE ALL GOING AWAY
CONCLUDED THE LITTLE GIRL WITH A LONG SIGH OF RELIEF I MUST GET HER THERE JUST AS SOON AS I GET HOME SHE DECIDED THEN SUDDENLY SYLVIA SAT STRAIGHT UP IN BED THE CLOSET DOOR HAD SWUNG SOFTLY OPEN AND A FIGURE WITH A BIG HAT AND TRAILING DRESS STEPPED OUT
MISTER FULTON CAME TO MEET THEM AND HELPED THEM ON BOARD THE BOAT AS THE BUTTERFLY MADE ITS WAY OUT INTO THE CHANNEL THE LITTLE GIRLS LOOKED BACK AT THE LONG WATER FRONT WHERE LAY MANY VESSELS FROM FAR OFF PORTS IN THE DISTANCE THEY COULD SEE THE SPIRE OF SAINT PHILIP'S
MISSUS FULTON WAS NOT IN HER ROOM SO SYLVIA WENT DOWN THE STAIRS TO LOOK FOR HER SHE HEARD VOICES IN THE SITTING ROOM AND TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION OH SHE WHISPERED AS SHE STOOD IN THE OPEN DOOR
EXCEPT FOR A LOW VOICED BUZZING THERE WAS NO DISTURBANCE BILLIE CAME UP SHE SEEMED TO DIVINE THE TEMPER OF THE MOB SHE CAUGHT HER BREATH SHARPLY AND THEN SAID VERY SIMPLY IT REMINDS ME OF BETHLEHEM
THEN WE ALL FEASTED ON THE EMPEROR'S STORE AND SOON WERE FEELING LIKE OURSELVES MEN I SAID IMPRESSIVELY I AM PROUD OF YE
SO FAR AS I'M CONCERNED ESTRA AND HIS SISTER CAN FACE THAT CROWD ALONE I DON'T APPROVE OF THE SCHEME THE DOCTOR EYED HIM THOUGHTFULLY I'M NOT SO SURE VAN THIS IS A TREMENDOUS THING WE OUGHT TO VAN IS RIGHT EXPLODED BILLIE
DOST RECALL EDAM'S VISION OF THE CREATURES IN THE AIR OF JEOS HE WENT ON KNOWING THAT I WOULD NOT HINDER HIM NOW AS I REMEMBER IT HE SAID THEY FLEW WITH GREAT SPEED
GO HE SHOUTED GO QUICKLY WHILE YOU CAN BILLIE STOOD STOCK STILL GAZING AT HIM I'M GOING TO STAY SHE SCREAMED I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES WITH HE THRUST HER THROUGH THE WINDOW
LAID OUT IN ORDERLY FASHION HERE HOWEVER AS OUTSIDE EVERYTHING WAS COATED WITH THAT FINE CREAM COLORED DUST IT FILLED EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY
SO THAT IT HAD TO RETURN AT ONCE BUT THE OTHER SEVEN CAME OUT TO THE BATTLE LINE AND BEGAN TO CIRCLE THE CITY AS THEY DID SO THEY DROPPED ODD MISSHAPEN PARCELS TOTALLY UNLIKE MATERIALS OF WAR
THOU DIDST ATTACK WITHOUT PROVOCATION THY LIFE IS FORFEIT AND AS MANY MORE AS MAY BE FOUND NEEDFUL TO GUARANTEE PEACE THEN I QUOTH MY MANNER CHANGING
WERE IT NOT POSSIBLE STROKOR FOR SUITABLE ENGINES TO PROPEL VERY LIGHT STRUCTURES AT SUCH HIGH SPEED AS TO REMAIN SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AFTER THE MANNER OF LEAVES IN A STORM
THEN YE HAVE SAVED ME THE TROUBLE OF DECIDING WHAT SHALL BE THY FATE EXECUTION SAY YOU SO BE IT AND I STRODE DOWN TO THE GREAT LOG OF IRON WHICH LAY READY TO FILL THE GAP
HE TURNED AND THE SMILE CAME BACK TO HIS FACE HE TOOK BILLIE'S HAND AND LAID IT BETWEEN BOTH HIS OWN HIS VOICE WAS EVEN GENTLER THAN BEFORE MOST CERTAINLY I DO FAVOR MY SISTER'S METHOD BILLIE IT WILL BE THE GREATEST BOON THE RACE HAS EVER KNOWN
AND WHIRLED UPON MAKA IN WRATH THINK YE THAT THERE BE A SPY AMONG US I DEMANDED HOW ELSE CAN YE EXPLAIN THIS THING MY MEN HAVE COMBED THE LAND ABOUT US
NEVER WAS THERE A FINER GUARD ABOUT THE PALACE MY FIRST CARE WAS TO PICK A QUARREL WITH THE OUTGOING COMMANDER TWERE EASY ENOUGH HE WAS GREEN WITH ENVY ANYHOW
THERE WAS A THUD A METALLIC CRASH AND A GREAT ROAR OF VOICES THE MOB HAD BROKEN IN AND UP THROUGH THE BACK OF THE HOUSE THE FIRST OF THE ATTACKERS THRUST HIS HEAD AND SHOULDERS INTO SIGHT NOT TEN FEET AWAY
IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD MENTALLY AND STILL ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD AS TO BODY IN SHORT I OFFER YOU THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH ITSELF THE SPEAKER PAUSED
NONE BUT A BLIND MAN COULD HAVE MISSED THE RESPECT THEY SHOWED ME WHEN ALL BANDAGED AND SORE I LINED THEM UP NEXT MORNING AFTERWARD I LEARNED THAT THEY HAD ALL TAKEN A PLEDGE TO FOLLOW STROKOR THROUGH THE GATES OF HOFE ITSELF
HE KNOWS IT ALREADY REMINDED BILLIE SWIFTLY A GREAT SHOUT CAME FROM BELOW THE ATTACKERS HAD FORCED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CROWD OF ESTRA'S FRIENDS WELL VAN EMMON STOOD SQUARELY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WOMEN TIS A MAN'S JOB AHEAD OF THEE AND THE FUTURE OF THE EMPIRE IS IN THY HANDS AND AS HE CLATTERED OFF FILL NOT THY HEAD WITH WONDERINGS ABOUT THE LIGHTNING
AND AT A PREARRANGED TIME MY QUARTER MILLION MEN SET OUT A COMPANY IN EACH TINY FLEET SOME WERE SLIGHTLY IN ADVANCE OF THE REST WHO HAD THE SHORTER DISTANCE TO TRAVEL
THE MEN OBEYED WITH ALACRITY MAKING OFF AT TOP SPEED WITH THE MEN OF KLOW IN HOT PURSUIT ALTHOUGH ABLE TO DO LITTLE DAMAGE AYE IT WERE A SORROWFUL THING THAT RETREAT THE BEST I COULD DO
INSTANTLY THEY IDENTIFIED IT IT WAS A CANNON SHELL AGAIN VAN EMMON LED THE WAY THEY TOOK A REASSURING GLANCE OUT THE WINDOW AT THE FAMILIAR CUBE THEN PASSED ALONG THE AISLE TOWARD THE FARTHER CORNER
OURS AND ALL OUR TOOLS OF WAR ARE FORMED OF AN ALLOY WHICH IS IMMUNE FROM THE MAGIC HE TOOK THE AX IN WONDERMENT WHAT MEANS IT STROKOR
BUT FOR THE DUST IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLACED THERE TEN MINUTES BEFORE ON THE BENCH LAY SEVERAL TOOLS SOME FAMILIAR TO THE ENGINEER AND SOME ENTIRELY STRANGE A SET OF SCREW DRIVERS OF VARIOUS SIZES CAUGHT HIS EYE
AND SO IT CAME ABOUT THAT WE MET ABOUT MID AFTERNOON WITH SECONDS IN A WELL FREQUENTED FIELD IN THE OUTSKIRTS
THERE ARE NONE OF THE LOUTS SECRETED HERE AND EVEN SO THEY COULD NOT HAVE NOTIFIED KLOW SO SOON BESIDES TIS PITCH DARK I WERE SORELY MYSTIFIED
KLOW LOOKED AT ME WITH A PECULIAR EXPRESSION AS THOUGH HE THOUGHT ME MAD TRUE IT LOOKED IT HOW COULD I DO HIM HARM WITHOUT MYSELF SUFFERING BUT I KICKED THE PROPS WHICH HELD THE IRON
WE COVERED HIM WITH QUICKLIME AND SOME EARTH AS SOON AS WE HAD TAKEN CARE OF THOSE WHO WERE NOT TOO FAR GONE I CALLED THE MEN TOGETHER AND CAUSED A ROUND OF SPIRITS TO BE SERVED
COME ON DON'T SACRIFICE YOURSELF THE DOOR BULGED UNDER THE ATTACK THE NOISE WAS EAR SPLITTING NEVERTHELESS ESTRA HEARD AND SHOOK HIS HEAD WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE WOMAN FROM THE EARTH SHE DASHED TO THE WINDOW THEN CAME BACK
IN TRUTH WE WOULD HAVE ALL BEEN LOST HAD WE COME IN THE MANNER OF FORMER CAMPAIGNS ALL TOGETHER IN BIG TRANSPORTS BUT BECAUSE WE COULD SCATTER EVERY WHICH WAY
CONSTANTLY HOLDING THEM BACK FROM THE LOFTY HEIGHTS OF SPIRITUAL POWER TO WHICH THEY ASPIRE HE PAUSED AND SAVARONA'S VOICE BROKE IN TRIUMPHANTLY YOU ARE RIGHT ESTRA YOU ARE RIGHT EXCEPT YOU DID NOT MENTION THAT THIS JEALOUSY
THE PATIENT SHOWED A TINY VARIATION FROM THE ALLOWABLE SUBCONSCIOUS MAXIMUM TOGETHER WITH ONLY NINE TENTHS THE REQUIRED MOTOR REACTION BUT I HAVE CORRECTED THIS BRIEFLY I HAVE INCORPORATED IN PARIO CAMENOL'S STANDARD DIET
STAND THEN AND DEFEND THYSELF AND IT DID ME GOOD TO SEE THE SPIRIT FLY INTO HIS EYES HE SAW THAT HIS EMPIRE LIVED OR DIED AS HE LIVED OR DIED
SMITH'S PRIDE WAS INSTANTLY AROUSED HE TUCKED IT UNDER HIS ARM AND WAS IMPATIENT TO GET BACK TO THE CUBE
AS MUCH SO AS OUR FINGER PRINTS THE MEASUREMENTS CORRESPOND IDENTICALLY WITH THOSE OF PARIO CAMENOL BEYOND A DOUBT THIS BOY CAN BE NONE OTHER THAN PARIO THEN THE HIGH PITCHED VOICE WENT ON
TILL THE DAWN CAME THINKING OUT A PLAN OF ACTION BY THAT TIME I WAS FAIR CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS NAUGHT TO BE GAINED BY WAITING WAITING MAKES ME IMPATIENT AS WELL
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES GUARDING AGAINST A CERTAIN EXUBERANCE PERHAPS IT WAS THE EXTRA OXYGEN TOO THEY STRODE TOWARD THE LARGE STRUCTURE DIRECTLY AHEAD AT ITS ENTRANCE A WIDE SQUARE PORTAL
INSTANTLY THE WHISTLES SOUNDED AND MY HEARTIES CAME BOUNDING INTO THE FIELD TREACHERY SHOUTED KLOW AND HIS OFFICERS RAN HERE AND THERE SHOUTING TO ARMS CHARGE AND DESTROY
AT THE END OF THE AISLE THEY REACHED A SMALL RAILED IN SPACE
IN A WAY IT WAS SPANISH OR RATHER THE PURE CASTILIAN TONGUE BUT IT SEEMED TO BE DEVOID OF DENTAL CONSONANTS
EVEN THE UPPERMOST CORNERS TEN FEET ABOVE THEIR HEADS
AND HE FOUGHT AS HE HAD NEVER FOUGHT BEFORE SMALL MAN THAT HE WAS BESIDE MYSELF HE WERE WONDROUS QUICK AND SURE IN HIS MOTIONS BEFORE I KNEW IT HE HAD BIT HIS AX DEEP INTO MY SIDE
KNOCKING AGAINST THE RAILING NEXT INSTANT IT LAY ON THE FLOOR
I SEE NOW SHE MURMURED THAT'S WHY THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO GREET US THE VENUSIAN SMILED GRATEFULLY WE THOUGHT IT BEST YOU'D HAVE BEEN SHOCKED OUTRIGHT I AM SURE
AT THAT THEY ALL GRINNED HAPPILY AND I ADDED AND TIS A FINE STAFF OF GENERALS THAT YE'LL MAKE NEED I SAY MORE
IF YOUNG HEARTS WERE NOT SO CLEVER OH THEY WOULD BE YOUNG FOR EVER THINK NO MORE TIS ONLY THINKING LAYS LADS UNDERGROUND
WHERE THE LAD LIES DOWN TO REST STANDS THE TROUBLED DREAM BESIDE THERE ON THOUGHTS THAT ONCE WERE MINE DAY LOOKS DOWN THE EASTERN STEEP AND THE YOUTH AT MORNING SHINE MAKES THE VOW HE WILL NOT KEEP
THEN I MIGHT HAVE BUILT PERHAPS GALLOWS TREES FOR OTHER CHAPS NEVER DANGLED ON MY OWN HAD I BUT LEFT ILL ALONE NOW YOU SEE THEY HANG ME HIGH
AND SAW YOUR ROAD AND WHERE IT LED AND EARLY WISE AND BRAVE IN SEASON PUT THE PISTOL TO YOUR HEAD OH SOON AND BETTER SO THAN LATER AFTER LONG DISGRACE AND SCORN
THERE IN THE WINDLESS NIGHT TIME THE WANDERER MARVELLING WHY HALTS ON THE BRIDGE TO HEARKEN HOW SOFT THE POPLARS SIGH HE HEARS LONG SINCE FORGOTTEN IN FIELDS WHERE I WAS KNOWN HERE I LIE DOWN IN LONDON AND TURN TO REST ALONE
WITH THE GREAT GALE WE JOURNEY THAT BREATHES FROM GARDENS THINNED BORNE IN THE DRIFT OF BLOSSOMS WHOSE PETALS THRONG THE WIND BUOYED ON THE HEAVEN HEARD WHISPER OF DANCING LEAFLETS WHIRLED
I TELL THE TALE THAT I HEARD TOLD
KNOW YOU WHY YOU CANNOT REST TIS THAT EVERY MOTHER'S SON TRAVAILS WITH A SKELETON LIE DOWN IN THE BED OF DUST BEAR THE FRUIT THAT BEAR YOU MUST
SEE MY NECK AND SAVE YOUR OWN COMRADES ALL LEAVE ILL ALONE MAKE SOME DAY A DECENT END SHREWDER FELLOWS THAN YOUR FRIEND
I SHALL STAND AND BEAR IT STILL COURAGE LAD TIS NOT FOR LONG STAND QUIT YOU LIKE STONE BE STRONG
WESTWARD ON THE HIGH HILLED PLAINS WHERE FOR ME THE WORLD BEGAN STILL I THINK IN NEWER VEINS FRETS THE CHANGELESS BLOOD OF MAN NOW THAT OTHER LADS THAN I STRIP TO BATHE ON SEVERN SHORE THEY NO HELP FOR ALL THEY TRY TREAD THE MILL I TROD BEFORE
AND EARLY WISE AND BRAVE IN SEASON PUT THE PISTOL TO YOUR HEAD OH SOON AND BETTER SO THAN LATER AFTER LONG DISGRACE AND SCORN YOU SHOT DEAD THE HOUSEHOLD TRAITOR THE SOUL THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN BORN
DYING AS THEY FLY THICK ON THE WIND ARE SOWN THE NAMES OF MEN BLOW SOUNDLESS BY MY FELLOWS AND MY OWN
THEY HAVE ENOUGH AS TIS I SEE IN MANY AN EYE THAT MEASURES ME THE MORTAL SICKNESS OF A MIND TOO UNHAPPY TO BE KIND UNDONE WITH MISERY
THERE BY THE STARLIT FENCES THE WANDERER HALTS AND HEARS MY SOUL THAT LINGERS SIGHING ABOUT THE GLIMMERING WEIRS
STILL HE STOOD AND EYED ME HARD AN EARNEST AND A GRAVE REGARD WHAT LAD DROOPING WITH YOUR LOT I TOO WOULD BE WHERE I AM NOT
AND I WILL DIE OH AT HOME HAD I BUT STAYED PRENTICED TO MY FATHER'S TRADE HAD I STUCK TO PLANE AND ADZE I HAD NOT BEEN LOST MY LADS
ALE MAN ALE'S THE STUFF TO DRINK FOR FELLOWS WHOM IT HURTS TO THINK LOOK INTO THE PEWTER POT TO SEE THE WORLD AS THE WORLD'S NOT AND FAITH TIS PLEASANT TILL TIS PAST
AND LIGHT ON ME MY TROUBLE LAY AND I SLEPT OUT IN FLESH AND BONE MANFUL LIKE THE MAN OF STONE
AND IF AS A LAD GROWS OLDER THE TROUBLES HE BEARS ARE MORE HE CARRIES HIS GRIEFS ON A SHOULDER THAT HANDSELLED THEM LONG BEFORE
BUT TAKE IT IF THE SMACK IS SOUR THE BETTER FOR THE EMBITTERED HOUR IT SHOULD DO GOOD TO HEART AND HEAD WHEN YOUR SOUL IS IN MY SOUL'S STEAD AND I WILL FRIEND YOU IF I MAY
SO TAKE ME IN YOUR ARMS A SPACE BEFORE THE EAST IS GREY WHEN I FROM HENCE AWAY AM PAST I SHALL NOT FIND A BRIDE AND YOU SHALL BE THE FIRST AND LAST I EVER LAY BESIDE
THE CARPENTER'S SON HERE THE HANGMAN STOPS HIS CART NOW THE BEST OF FRIENDS MUST PART FARE YOU WELL FOR ILL FARE I LIVE LADS
SLOW THE ENDLESS NIGHT COMES ON AND LATE TO FULNESS GROWS THE BIRTH THAT SHALL LAST AS LONG AS EARTH WANDERERS EASTWARD WANDERERS WEST
EMPTY HEADS AND TONGUES A TALKING MAKE THE ROUGH ROAD EASY WALKING AND THE FEATHER PATE OF FOLLY BEARS THE FALLING SKY OH TIS JESTING DANCING DRINKING SPINS THE HEAVY WORLD AROUND
AND STEDFASTLY HE LOOKED AT ME WELL MET I THOUGHT THE LOOK WOULD SAY WE BOTH WERE FASHIONED FAR AWAY WE NEITHER KNEW WHEN WE WERE YOUNG THESE LONDONERS WE LIVE AMONG
OH LOUD MY GIRL IT ONCE WOULD KNOCK YOU SHOULD HAVE FELT IT THEN BUT SINCE FOR YOU I STOPPED THE CLOCK IT NEVER GOES AGAIN OH LAD WHAT IS IT LAD THAT DRIPS WET FROM YOUR NECK ON MINE WHAT IS IT FALLING ON MY LIPS MY LAD THAT TASTES OF BRINE
LIGHT WAS THE AIR BENEATH THE SKY BUT DARK UNDER THE SHADE OH DO YOU BREATHE LAD THAT YOUR BREAST SEEMS NOT TO RISE AND FALL AND HERE UPON MY BOSOM PREST THERE BEATS NO HEART AT ALL
BY VALLEY GUARDED GRANGES AND SILVER WATERS WIDE CONTENT AT HEART I FOLLOWED WITH MY DELIGHTFUL GUIDE AND LIKE THE CLOUDY SHADOWS ACROSS THE COUNTRY BLOWN
BE STILL MY SOUL BE STILL THE ARMS YOU BEAR ARE BRITTLE EARTH AND HIGH HEAVEN ARE FIXT OF OLD AND FOUNDED STRONG THINK RATHER CALL TO THOUGHT IF NOW YOU GRIEVE A LITTLE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD REST O SOUL FOR THEY WERE LONG
ALL THEY CAN IS TO HATE THEIR FELLOW MAN AND TILL THEY DROP THEY NEEDS MUST STILL LOOK AT YOU AND WISH YOU ILL
HUGHLEY STEEPLE THE VANE ON HUGHLEY STEEPLE VEERS BRIGHT A FAR KNOWN SIGN AND THERE LIE HUGHLEY PEOPLE AND THERE LIE FRIENDS OF MINE
HEIGHO THE TALE WAS ALL A LIE THE WORLD IT WAS THE OLD WORLD YET I WAS I MY THINGS WERE WET AND NOTHING NOW REMAINED TO DO BUT BEGIN THE GAME ANEW THEREFORE
TWO FRIENDS KEPT STEP BESIDE ME TWO HONEST LADS AND HALE NOW DICK LIES LONG IN THE CHURCHYARD AND NED LIES LONG IN JAIL
AND WITH KIND LOOKS AND LAUGHTER AND NOUGHT TO SAY BESIDE WE TWO WENT ON TOGETHER I AND MY HAPPY GUIDE ACROSS THE GLITTERING PASTURES AND EMPTY UPLAND STILL AND SOLITUDE OF SHEPHERDS HIGH IN THE FOLDED HILL
SO QUICK SO CLEAN AN ENDING OH THAT WAS RIGHT LAD THAT WAS BRAVE YOURS WAS NOT AN ILL FOR MENDING TWAS BEST TO TAKE IT TO THE GRAVE OH YOU HAD FORETHOUGHT YOU COULD REASON AND SAW YOUR ROAD AND WHERE IT LED
IN MY OWN SHIRE IF I WAS SAD HOMELY COMFORTERS I HAD THE EARTH BECAUSE MY HEART WAS SORE SORROWED FOR THE SON SHE BORE AND STANDING HILLS LONG TO REMAIN SHARED THEIR SHORT LIVED COMRADE'S PAIN
BREAK NO ROSEMARY BRIGHT WITH RIME AND SPARKLING TO THE CRUEL CLIME NOR PLOD THE WINTER LAND TO LOOK FOR WILLOWS IN THE ICY BROOK TO CAST THEM LEAFLESS ROUND HIM
THE ROSE LIPT GIRLS ARE SLEEPING IN FIELDS WHERE ROSES FADE
LIVE LADS AND I WILL DIE
TERENCE THIS IS STUPID STUFF YOU EAT YOUR VICTUALS FAST ENOUGH THERE CAN'T BE MUCH AMISS TIS CLEAR TO SEE THE RATE YOU DRINK YOUR BEER BUT OH GOOD LORD THE VERSE YOU MAKE IT GIVES A CHAP THE BELLY ACHE
AND FAITH TIS PLEASANT TILL TIS PAST THE MISCHIEF IS THAT TWILL NOT LAST OH I HAVE BEEN TO LUDLOW FAIR AND LEFT MY NECKTIE GOD KNOWS WHERE AND CARRIED HALF WAY HOME OR NEAR PINTS AND QUARTS OF LUDLOW BEER
HAND SAID I SINCE NOW WE PART FROM FIELDS AND MEN WE KNOW BY HEART FROM STRANGERS FACES STRANGERS LANDS HAND YOU HAVE HELD TRUE FELLOWS HANDS
THIS TONGUE THAT TALKS THESE LUNGS THAT SHOUT THESE THEWS THAT HUSTLE US ABOUT THIS BRAIN THAT FILLS THE SKULL WITH SCHEMES AND ITS HUMMING HIVE OF DREAMS
AND STEEPLE SHADOWED SLUMBER THE SLAYERS OF THEMSELVES TO NORTH TO SOUTH LIE PARTED WITH HUGHLEY TOWER ABOVE THE KIND THE SINGLE HEARTED
FAR IN A WESTERN BROOKLAND THAT BRED ME LONG AGO THE POPLARS STAND AND TREMBLE BY POOLS I USED TO KNOW THERE IN THE WINDLESS NIGHT TIME
ON THE IDLE HILL OF SUMMER SLEEPY WITH THE FLOW OF STREAMS FAR I HEAR THE STEADY DRUMMER DRUMMING LIKE A NOISE IN DREAMS FAR AND NEAR AND LOW AND LOUDER ON THE ROADS OF EARTH GO BY DEAR TO FRIENDS AND FOOD FOR POWDER
YET IF OUR HOSTESS WERE TO SEE US MARCHING OUT WITH AN UMBRELLA HOW ODD SHE WOULD THINK US WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO SHE WOULD ASK AND WE COULD ONLY ANSWER LAMELY
THE FRIEND OF MAN WHEN SWORDS WENT OUT OF FASHION WALKING STICKS I SUPPOSE CAME INTO FASHION THE PRESENT CUSTOM HAS ITS ADVANTAGES EVEN IN HIS BUSIEST DAY THE HERO'S SWORD MUST HAVE RETURNED AT TIMES TO ITS SCABBARD
YOU HAVE BOUGHT A NEW BAT PERFECT IN BALANCE
STILL LESS ON THE GENIUS OF KENNETH GRAHAME YOU ARE MERELY SITTING IN JUDGMENT ON YOURSELF YOU MAY BE WORTHY I DO NOT KNOW
HAS DONE THE DAMAGE THE SOUL YEARNS FOR SOMETHING MORE STARTLING THAN THAT THE RECORD OF THE POND
HE HAS MADE SUPERB APPROACHES HE HAS RUN DOWN THE LONG PUTT ANY OF THESE THINGS MAY SUDDENLY HAPPEN TO HIM AGAIN
THE FOURTH AND FINAL STAGE BEYOND THE REACH OF ALL BUT THE FAVOURED FEW
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE D W T THE DECLINED WITH THANKS CLUB THERE ARE NO CLUB ROOMS AND NOT MANY MEMBERS BUT THE BALANCE SHEET FOR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS IS WONDERFUL SHOWING THAT MORE THAN
IS GIVING A MESSAGE TO THE WORLD EXPRESSING THE TRUTH AS HE SEES IT FOR HIS OWN PROFIT PERHAPS BUT NOT FOR THAT ALONE
I TAPPED THE TABLE TWO OR THREE TIMES AND NOW I SUPPOSE I AM IMMUNE AT THE SAME TIME I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHOM I HAVE APPEASED FOR THIS MUST BE THE IDEA OF THE WOOD TOUCHING SUPERSTITION THAT A MALIGNANT SPIRIT DOGS ONE'S CONVERSATIONAL FOOTSTEPS
SHE HADN'T ACTUALLY READ HIS FAMOUS LETTERS BUT SHE HAD OFTEN WANTED TO
THAT WOULD BE A MORAL TONIC MORE NEEDED THAN ALL THE DRAUGHTS OF YOUR NEWLY ENDOWED HOSPITALS WILL IT EVER BE ADMINISTERED WELL PERHAPS WHEN THE D W T CLUB HAS GROWN A LITTLE STRONGER
IS THE TRUE HOME AFTER ALL WHEN I PASS LABURNUM LODGE I THINK OF HIM SAYING GOOD BYE TO HER AT THE GATE AS HE TAKES THE AIR EACH MORNING ON HIS WAY TO THE STATION WHAT IF THE TRAIN IS CROWDED
AS SOON AS THIS GENTLEMAN APPROACHES HE WHIPS OUT THE BOOK DUSTS IT AND PLACES IT BEFORE THE RACONTEUR HE RECOGNIZES ALSO AT A GLANCE THE SORT OF SILLY ASS
IN THE QUIET HOURS WHEN WE ARE ALONE WITH OURSELVES AND THERE IS NOBODY TO TELL US WHAT FINE FELLOWS WE ARE WE COME SOMETIMES UPON A WEAK MOMENT IN WHICH WE WONDER
THE BELIEVER IN ASTROLOGY LOOKS UP AND REALIZES AFRESH HIS OVERWHELMING IMPORTANCE PERHAPS AFTER ALL I AM GLAD I DO NOT BELIEVE LIFE MUST BE A VERY TRICKY THING FOR THE SUPERSTITIOUS
ANOTHER HALL MARK BY WHICH WE CAN TELL WHETHER A MAN HAS ARRIVED OR NOT IS PROVIDED BY THE INTERVIEW IF SAY A LEPIDOPTERIST IS JUST BEGINNING HIS CAREER
DRAINS SECRETLY INTO THE POND TOO THIS SEEMS TO ME TO GIVE A MUCH FAIRER INDICATION OF THE RAIN THAT HAS FALLEN THAN DO THE OFFICIAL FIGURES IN THE NEWSPAPERS
FOR THE POND IS JUST A SMALL ARTIFICIAL AFFAIR OF CEMENT ENTIRELY UNPRETENTIOUS THERE ARE SEVEN STEPS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POND AND EACH STEP
COULD I STEP ON TO THE BOAT IN A SILK HAT AND THEN RETIRE BELOW BUT I AM ALWAYS UNWELL BELOW AND THAT WOULD NOT SUIT ITS DIGNITY IT STANDS NOW IN A CORNER OF MY ROOM CRYING ALOUD TO BE TAKEN TO THE OPERA I USED TO DISLIKE MEN WHO TOOK CANES TO COVENT GARDEN
SEDLEY OF COURSE WILL BE ELECTED AS AN ORDINARY MEMBER BUT AS THERE IS A STRONG FEELING ON THE COMMITTEE THAT NO DECENT MAN COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING ELSE
AND IF THE NEXT STROKE IS GOOD WHAT HAPPINESS FILLS OUR SOUL HOW EAGERLY WE TELL OURSELVES THAT IN A LITTLE WHILE ALL OUR STROKES WILL BE AS GOOD WHAT DOES VARDON KNOW OF THIS IF HE DOES A FIVE HOLE IN FOUR HE BLAMES HIMSELF THAT HE DID NOT DO IT IN THREE
REFUSE THE MILLION POUNDS THAT WOULD BE A SHOCK TO THE SYSTEMS OF THE COMFORTABLE A BLOW STRUCK AT THE GREAT MONEY GOD WHICH WOULD MAKE IT TOTTER A THRUST IN DEFENCE OF PRIDE
IN AS FAR AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO A MAN WHO SELLS BOTH SCENTED SOAP AND PILCHARDS WOULD BECOME NARROW WE DO NOT COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD MUCH SAVE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF POTTED LOBSTER
FOR IT WAS GIVEN TO ME THIS VERY MORNING AT MY FIRST SIGHT OF IT I THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT REPLACE THE COMMON ONE WHICH I LOST IN AN EASTER TRAIN THAT WAS SILLY OF ME I MUST HAVE A STICK OF LESS GENTLE BIRTH WHICH IS NOT AFRAID TO BE SEEN WITH A SOFT HAT
THE IDEAL COUNTRY STICK WILL NEVER BE FOUND IT MUST BE THICK ENOUGH TO STAND MUCH ROUGH USAGE OF A SORT WHICH I WILL EXPLAIN PRESENTLY AND YET IT MUST BE THIN SO THAT IT MAKES A PLEASANT WHISTLING SOUND THROUGH THE AIR
AND HAD A WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN BUT HE WILL NOT ADMIT THAT HE DID ANYTHING AT ALL OUT OF THE COMMON THE CASE OF SEDLEY COMES UP FOR CONSIDERATION AT THE NEXT COMMITTEE MEETING SEDLEY'S RICH UNCLE
WILL BE DECLINED SAY COME AND LOOK AT THE POND AND THE WORST SLUGGARD WILL NOT REFUSE SUCH GENTLE EXERCISE AND ONCE HE IS OUT HE IS OUT
IN THE MORNING TOO ANNE WILL WALK WITH HIM TO THE END OF THE ROAD
WHO HAS DISCOVERED A NEW WAY OF DARKENING THE HAIR AND MISS GIRLIE DE TRACY WHO HAS BEEN ARRESTED FOR SHOP LIFTING IN THE SAME WAY THE MORE THE PRESS INSISTS THAT A WRITER IS
OR PULL UP THE LUNCHEON BASKET WHICH YOU WANT EVEN MORE BADLY
THAT ONE HARDLY DARES TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST THE PROFESSION BESIDES ONE NEVER KNOWS WHEN ONE MAY NOT WANT TO BE DEFENDED HOWEVER I SHALL TAKE THE RISK AND PUT THE BARRISTER IN THE DOCK
BUT CAN THERE BE AN IDEAL BARRISTER OTHER THAN A SUCCESSFUL BARRISTER THE EAGER YOUNG WRITER JUST BEGINNING A LITERARY CAREER MIGHT
AND ARE ONLY CONCERNED TO DISPLAY THAT READINESS IN THE FACE OF ANY SOCIAL EMERGENCY WHICH IS SAID TO BE THE MARK OF GOOD MANNERS
THE JOY OF DRIVING A BALL STRAIGHT AFTER A WEEK OF SLICING THE JOY OF PUTTING A MASHIE SHOT DEAD THE JOY OF EVEN A MODERATE STROKE WITH A BRASSIE BEST OF ALL THE JOY OF THE PERFECT CLEEK SHOT THESE THINGS THE GOOD PLAYER WILL NEVER KNOW
AND REMAINS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMMITTEE BAINES IS A LIFE MEMBER HE SAVED AN OLD LADY FROM BEING RUN OVER BY A MOTOR BUS SOME YEARS AGO AND WHEN SHE DIED SHE LEFT HIM A LEGACY
AFTERWARDS WORKED TILL FIVE AND HAD MY HAIR CUT ON THE WAY HOME AFTER DINNER READ A MAN'S PASSION BY THEODORA POPGOOD ROTTEN WENT TO BED AT ELEVEN TUESDAY HAD A LETTER FROM JANE
HE HAS DECLINED WITH THANKS MOREOVER INVITATIONS TO HALF A DOZEN HOUSES SENT TO HIM BY HOSTESSES WHO ONLY KNEW HIM BY REPUTATION MYSELF
WHAT THE WORLD IS EAGER FOR NOW IS TO BE TOLD HIS VIEWS ON SUNDAY GAMES THE DECADENCE OF THE THEATRE OR BANDS IN THE PARKS
IT WAS NOT EXACTLY MILTON AND NOT EXACTLY CARLYLE
BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SORT OF DIARY WHICH CAN NEVER BE OF ANY IMPORTANCE AT ALL I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR GIVING A THIRD SELECTION OF EXTRACTS MONDAY ROSE AT NINE AND CAME DOWN TO FIND A LETTER FROM MARY HOW LITTLE WE KNOW OUR TRUE FRIENDS
FELL INTO THE THAMES ON MY WAY HOME BUT SWAM ASHORE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY ALAS WE CANNOT DO THIS OUR DIARIES ARE VERY PROSAIC VERY DULL INDEED THEY READ LIKE THIS
TO BEND BEFORE THE FORCES WHICH WORK FOR HARM AND THEY PAY TRIBUTE TO FATE BY MEANS OF THESE LITTLE CUSTOMS IN THE HOPE THAT THEY WILL SECURE IN RETURN AN IMMUNITY FROM EVIL THE TRIBUTE IS NOMINAL BUT IT IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT ALL THE SAME
SINCE OTHELLO ALSO IS ONE OF THE TERMS OF THE RELATION WHEN WE SAY THAT IT IS A RELATION OF FOUR TERMS WE DO NOT MEAN THAT OTHELLO HAS A CERTAIN RELATION TO DESDEMONA AND HAS THE SAME RELATION TO LOVING AND ALSO TO CASSIO THIS MAY BE TRUE OF SOME OTHER RELATION THAN BELIEVING
KANT WHO FIRST EMPHASIZED THIS CONTRADICTION DEDUCED THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SPACE AND TIME WHICH HE DECLARED TO BE MERELY SUBJECTIVE AND SINCE HIS TIME VERY MANY PHILOSOPHERS HAVE BELIEVED THAT SPACE AND TIME
THEN FORGETTING THAT THIS WAS ONLY TRUE WHEN IDEAS WERE TAKEN AS ACTS OF APPREHENSION WE TRANSFER THE PROPOSITION THAT IDEAS ARE IN THE MIND TO IDEAS IN THE OTHER SENSE
IS THAT THEY HAVE OPERATED HITHERTO SO FAR AS OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST ENABLES US TO JUDGE IT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE A GREATER BODY OF EVIDENCE FROM THE PAST IN FAVOUR OF THE LAWS OF MOTION THAN WE HAVE IN FAVOUR OF THE SUNRISE
AND KENNEN IN GERMAN THUS THE STATEMENT WHICH SEEMED LIKE A TRUISM BECOMES WHEN RE STATED THE FOLLOWING WE CAN NEVER TRULY JUDGE THAT SOMETHING WITH WHICH WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED EXISTS
THE RELATION LOVING AS IT OCCURS IN THE ACT OF BELIEVING IS ONE OF THE OBJECTS IT IS A BRICK IN THE STRUCTURE NOT THE CEMENT THE CEMENT IS THE RELATION BELIEVING WHEN THE BELIEF IS TRUE THERE IS ANOTHER COMPLEX UNITY
HE FULLY ADMITS THAT THE TREE MUST CONTINUE TO EXIST EVEN WHEN WE SHUT OUR EYES OR WHEN NO HUMAN BEING IS NEAR IT BUT THIS CONTINUED EXISTENCE HE SAYS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT GOD CONTINUES TO PERCEIVE IT
WHEN A THING OF A CERTAIN SORT A HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A THING OF A CERTAIN OTHER SORT B AND HAS NEVER BEEN FOUND DISSOCIATED FROM A THING OF THE SORT B THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF CASES IN WHICH A AND B HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED
IT MAY BE SAID OF COURSE THAT I JUDGE THIS BECAUSE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM THIS HOWEVER WOULD BE AN IRRELEVANT RETORT SINCE IF THE PRINCIPLE WERE TRUE I COULD NOT KNOW THAT ANY ONE ELSE IS ACQUAINTED WITH HIM BUT FURTHER
THEY ARE NOT IN FACT SELF CONTRADICTORY BUT ONLY CONTRADICTORY OF CERTAIN RATHER OBSTINATE MENTAL PREJUDICES HENCE THE REASONS FOR REGARDING SPACE AND TIME AS UNREAL HAVE BECOME INOPERATIVE
AND REDUCE US TO UTTER DOUBT THE FACT IS THAT IN SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL JUDGEMENTS SUCH AS TWO AND TWO ARE FOUR AND ALSO IN MANY JUDGEMENTS OF LOGIC WE CAN KNOW THE GENERAL PROPOSITION WITHOUT INFERRING IT FROM INSTANCES
WHEN HOWEVER WE SPEAK OF PHILOSOPHY AS A CRITICISM OF KNOWLEDGE IT IS NECESSARY TO IMPOSE A CERTAIN LIMITATION IF WE ADOPT THE ATTITUDE OF THE COMPLETE SCEPTIC PLACING OURSELVES WHOLLY OUTSIDE ALL KNOWLEDGE
NOT IN ANY DEGREE EVIL WHOLLY RATIONAL AND WHOLLY SPIRITUAL ANY APPEARANCE TO THE CONTRARY IN THE WORLD WE KNOW CAN BE PROVED LOGICALLY SO HE BELIEVES
THE NECESSITY OF ALLOWING FOR FALSEHOOD MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REGARD BELIEF AS A RELATION OF THE MIND TO A SINGLE OBJECT WHICH COULD BE SAID TO BE WHAT IS BELIEVED IF BELIEF WERE SO REGARDED WE SHOULD FIND THAT LIKE ACQUAINTANCE
WHEN SWIFT INVITES US TO CONSIDER THE RACE OF STRULDBUGS WHO NEVER DIE WE ARE ABLE TO ACQUIESCE IN IMAGINATION BUT A WORLD WHERE TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE SEEMS QUITE ON A DIFFERENT LEVEL WE FEEL THAT SUCH A WORLD IF THERE WERE ONE WOULD UPSET THE WHOLE FABRIC OF OUR KNOWLEDGE
SO FAR AS THINGS ARE CONCERNED WE MAY KNOW THEM OR NOT KNOW THEM BUT THERE IS NO POSITIVE STATE OF MIND WHICH CAN BE DESCRIBED AS ERRONEOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS SO LONG AT ANY RATE AS WE CONFINE OURSELVES TO KNOWLEDGE BY ACQUAINTANCE WHATEVER WE ARE ACQUAINTED WITH MUST BE SOMETHING
BECAUSE THE GENERAL PROPOSITION TWO AND TWO ARE FOUR NEVER TOLD US THERE WERE SUCH PEOPLE AS BROWN AND JONES AND ROBINSON AND SMITH AND THE PARTICULAR PREMISSES DO NOT TELL US THAT THERE WERE FOUR OF THEM WHEREAS THE PARTICULAR PROPOSITION DEDUCED DOES TELL US BOTH THESE THINGS
BUT BELIEVING PLAINLY IS NOT A RELATION WHICH OTHELLO HAS TO EACH OF THE THREE TERMS CONCERNED BUT TO ALL OF THEM TOGETHER THERE IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF THE RELATION OF BELIEVING INVOLVED BUT THIS ONE EXAMPLE KNITS TOGETHER FOUR TERMS
AS OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GEOGRAPHY THEY MAINTAINED THAT BY THE REPEATED EXPERIENCE OF SEEING TWO THINGS AND TWO OTHER THINGS AND FINDING THAT ALTOGETHER THEY MADE FOUR THINGS WE WERE LED BY INDUCTION TO THE CONCLUSION THAT TWO THINGS AND TWO OTHER THINGS WOULD ALWAYS MAKE FOUR THINGS ALTOGETHER
THE REFERENCE TO THE FUTURE IN THIS QUESTION IS NOT ESSENTIAL THE SAME QUESTION ARISES WHEN WE APPLY THE LAWS THAT WORK IN OUR EXPERIENCE TO PAST THINGS OF WHICH WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE AS FOR EXAMPLE IN GEOLOGY OR IN THEORIES AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
TO WHICH THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS THE CRUDE EXPECTATIONS WHICH WE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING ARE ALL SUBJECT TO EXCEPTIONS AND THEREFORE LIABLE TO DISAPPOINT THOSE WHO ENTERTAIN THEM BUT SCIENCE HABITUALLY ASSUMES
THUS BY AN UNCONSCIOUS EQUIVOCATION WE ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT WHATEVER WE CAN APPREHEND MUST BE IN OUR MINDS THIS SEEMS TO BE THE TRUE ANALYSIS OF BERKELEY'S ARGUMENT AND THE ULTIMATE FALLACY UPON WHICH IT RESTS
WHICH SHALL NOT CONSIST IN RELATION TO SOMETHING WHOLLY OUTSIDE BELIEF THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTEMPT AT A DEFINITION OF THIS SORT IS THE THEORY THAT TRUTH CONSISTS IN COHERENCE IT IS SAID THAT THE MARK OF FALSEHOOD IS FAILURE TO COHERE IN THE BODY OF OUR BELIEFS
BOTH EXPERIENCE AND A PRIORI PRINCIPLES MUST BE REQUIRED IN THE PROOF KNOWLEDGE IS CALLED EMPIRICAL WHEN IT RESTS WHOLLY OR PARTLY UPON EXPERIENCE THUS ALL KNOWLEDGE WHICH ASSERTS EXISTENCE IS EMPIRICAL AND THE ONLY A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING EXISTENCE IS HYPOTHETICAL
IN THIS BELIEF THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN ALL THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WE CAN ACQUIRE A PRIORI CONCERNING EXISTENCE SEEMS TO BE HYPOTHETICAL IT TELLS US THAT IF ONE THING EXISTS ANOTHER MUST EXIST OR MORE GENERALLY THAT IF ONE PROPOSITION IS TRUE ANOTHER MUST BE TRUE
FROM THE FRAGMENTARY AND RELATIONAL CHARACTER OF THESE THINGS THUS WE ARE LEFT TO THE PIECEMEAL INVESTIGATION OF THE WORLD AND ARE UNABLE TO KNOW THE CHARACTERS OF THOSE PARTS OF THE UNIVERSE THAT ARE REMOTE FROM OUR EXPERIENCE
AND THIS KIND OF ASSOCIATION IS NOT CONFINED TO MEN IN ANIMALS ALSO IT IS VERY STRONG A HORSE WHICH HAS BEEN OFTEN DRIVEN ALONG A CERTAIN ROAD RESISTS THE ATTEMPT TO DRIVE HIM IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION
IF WE ARE TO KNOW OF THE EXISTENCE OF MATTER OF OTHER PEOPLE OF THE PAST BEFORE OUR INDIVIDUAL MEMORY BEGINS OR OF THE FUTURE WE MUST KNOW GENERAL PRINCIPLES
HE SHOWS THAT ALL WE KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHEN WE PERCEIVE THE TREE CONSISTS OF IDEAS IN HIS SENSE OF THE WORD AND HE ARGUES THAT THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST GROUND FOR SUPPOSING THAT THERE IS ANYTHING REAL ABOUT THE TREE EXCEPT WHAT IS PERCEIVED
FOR IF THERE WERE SUCH AN OBJECT THE BELIEF WOULD BE TRUE THERE IS IN FACT NO SUCH OBJECT AND THEREFORE OTHELLO CANNOT HAVE ANY RELATION TO SUCH AN OBJECT HENCE HIS BELIEF CANNOT POSSIBLY CONSIST IN A RELATION TO THIS OBJECT IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT HIS BELIEF
FOR WITH SUCH THINGS ALSO WE HAVE IMMEDIATE ACQUAINTANCE AT THE MOMENT OF REMEMBERING OR IMAGINING ALL SUCH IMMEDIATE DATA HE CALLS IDEAS HE THEN PROCEEDS TO CONSIDER COMMON OBJECTS SUCH AS A TREE FOR INSTANCE
SHOWING THAT MORE REFINED VIEWS AS TO THE UNIFORMITY OF NATURE WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL TO THE CHICKEN BUT IN SPITE OF THE MISLEADINGNESS OF SUCH EXPECTATIONS THEY NEVERTHELESS EXIST THE MERE FACT THAT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TIMES CAUSES ANIMALS AND MEN
IS ITSELF A CONNEXION OF UNIVERSALS AND IT IS ONLY IN VIRTUE OF THIS PRINCIPLE THAT EXPERIENCE ENABLES US TO ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING PHYSICAL OBJECTS THE SAME APPLIES TO THE LAW OF CAUSALITY
THIS HOPE I BELIEVE IS VAIN IT WOULD SEEM THAT KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE UNIVERSE AS A WHOLE IS NOT TO BE OBTAINED BY METAPHYSICS AND THAT THE PROPOSED PROOFS THAT IN VIRTUE OF THE LAWS OF LOGIC SUCH AND SUCH THINGS MUST EXIST
THAT DIFFERENT PEOPLE SEE MORE OR LESS THE SAME TREE THUS APART FROM MINDS AND THEIR IDEAS THERE IS NOTHING IN THE WORLD NOR IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ANYTHING ELSE SHOULD EVER BE KNOWN
A MIND WHICH BELIEVES BELIEVES TRULY WHEN THERE IS A CORRESPONDING COMPLEX NOT INVOLVING THE MIND BUT ONLY ITS OBJECTS THIS CORRESPONDENCE ENSURES TRUTH AND ITS ABSENCE ENTAILS FALSEHOOD
IT IS PLAIN THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITH ONE QUITE CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD INSTANCE OF A MAN DYING WHEREAS IN THE CASE OF TWO AND TWO ARE FOUR ONE INSTANCE DOES SUFFICE WHEN CAREFULLY CONSIDERED TO PERSUADE US THAT THE SAME MUST HAPPEN IN ANY OTHER INSTANCE
THIS RESULT DISAPPOINTING AS IT IS TO THOSE WHOSE HOPES HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHERS IS IN HARMONY WITH THE INDUCTIVE AND SCIENTIFIC TEMPER OF OUR AGE
IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT MATTER HAS NO IMPORTANCE FOR US PROVIDED IT EXISTS EVEN IF WE CANNOT KNOW THAT IT EXISTS WE CAN OBVIOUSLY SUSPECT THAT IT MAY EXIST AND WONDER WHETHER IT DOES HENCE IT IS CONNECTED WITH OUR DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE
OUR KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT MAY BE IS ENORMOUSLY INCREASED INSTEAD OF BEING SHUT IN WITHIN NARROW WALLS OF WHICH EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY COULD BE EXPLORED WE FIND OURSELVES IN AN OPEN WORLD OF FREE POSSIBILITIES
HOW CAN THERE BE KNOWLEDGE OF GENERAL PROPOSITIONS IN CASES WHERE WE HAVE NOT EXAMINED ALL THE INSTANCES AND INDEED NEVER CAN EXAMINE THEM ALL BECAUSE THEIR NUMBER IS INFINITE
INDUCTION WHICH GOES FROM THE PARTICULAR TO THE PARTICULAR OR FROM THE PARTICULAR TO THE GENERAL IT IS AN OLD DEBATE AMONG PHILOSOPHERS WHETHER DEDUCTION EVER GIVES NEW KNOWLEDGE WE CAN NOW SEE THAT IN CERTAIN CASES AT LEAST IT DOES DO SO
AN SO BRAVE I THINK HE'S THE BRAVEST THING I EVER SAW SUSAN BETTS YES HE IS BRAVE SAID SUSAN A LITTLE SHORTLY
CHAPTER ELEVEN NOT PATS BUT SCRATCHES MISSUS COLEBROOK WENT HOME THE NEXT DAY SHE WORE THE AIR OF AN INJURED MARTYR AT BREAKFAST SHE TOLD HER BROTHER THAT OF COURSE
BUT THE NEXT MORNING AFTER SHE HAD GIVEN KEITH HIS BREAKFAST NOT OF TOAST AND OATMEAL SHE SUGGESTED BLITHELY THAT HE GET UP AND BE DRESSED WHEN HE REFUSED SHE TRIED COAXING MILDLY THEN MORE STRENUOUSLY
SUSAN WAS MOVING SWIFTLY AROUND THE ROOM NOW OPENING CLOSET DOORS AND BUREAU DRAWERS NO NO SUSAN I CAN'T GET UP MOANED THE BOY TURNING HIS FACE BACK TO THE WALL I CAN'T I CAN'T YES YOU CAN NOW LISTEN THEY'RE ALL HERE EVERYTHING YOU NEED
BUT WHICH FILLED HER HEART WITH DISTRUST AND SO STILL SHE KEPT HER EYES ON KEITH IN JUNE DOROTHY PARKMAN CAME TO HINSDALE SHE CAME AT ONCE TO SEE SUSAN BUT SHE WOULD ONLY STEP INSIDE THE HALL AND SHE SPOKE LOW AND HURRIEDLY
WOULD HE SEE ME DO YOU THINK HE OUGHT TO HE SEES EVERYBODY ELSE I KNOW MAZIE SAYS DOES MAZIE KNOW ABOUT YOU INTERRUPTED SUSAN I MEAN ABOUT YOUR BEING MISS STEWART
DANIEL BURTON YOU AIN'T GOIN TO DEMEAN YOURSELF LIKE THAT SHE GASPED AN ARTISTICAL GENTLEMAN LIKE YOU WHY I'D RATHER WORK MY HANDS TO THE BONES THAT WILL DO SUSAN YOU MAY GO AND SUSAN WENT
YES THAT'S SO HE REPEATED AS HE PLUNGED DOWN THE STAIRS TO DANIEL BURTON HIMSELF SUSAN MADE NO FURTHER PROTESTS OR EVEN COMMENTS EXCEPT THE SILENT COMMENT OF EAGER SERVICE WITH SOME FAVORITE DISH FOR EVERY MEAL
HE TOLD ME HOW THEY HELD IT THE LITTLE CLUMP OF TREES THAT MEANT SO MUCH TO US AND HOW ONE BY ONE THEY FELL THOSE BRAVE FELLOWS WITH HIM I COULD SEE IT I COULD HEAR IT
DID KEITH DO THAT HE DID JEST NOW SIR ALL RIGHT SUSAN I I DON'T THINK YOU'LL HAVE TO SAY ANY MORE AND SUSAN AFTER A SHARP GLANCE INTO THE MAN'S HALF AVERTED FACE
OH KEITH WHY HE'D EVEN FORGET HIS EYES THEN IT WOULD HELP SOME KEITH DREW IN HIS BREATH AND HELD IT A MOMENT SUSPENDED AND HE'D EVEN BE HELPING US TO WIN OUT OVER THERE
IT WAS JUST THE WAY HE TOLD IT THAT'S WHY I KNOW HE COULD HAVE BEEN A WRITER HE COULD MAKE OTHERS SEE EVERYTHING BUT NOW THAT'S ALL OVER NOW HE'LL NEVER BE ANYTHING I CAN SEE HIM
OH YES HE SAID A GREAT DEAL BUT IT WAS ONLY A REPETITION OF WHAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE IN THE LETTER DANIEL BURTON SPOKE WEARILY CONSTRAINEDLY HIS FACE HAD GROWN A LITTLE WHITE THE DOCTOR BOUGHT
THERE WAS INCREDULOUS HURT AMAZEMENT IN THE BOY'S VOICE BUT SUSAN WAS VISIBLY STEELING HERSELF AGAINST IT WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT I'M LOAFIN ALL DAY AN YOUR AUNT GONE NOW AN ME WITH IT ALL ON MY HANDS SHE DEMANDED
BEAUTIFULLY ABOUT THAT TO DAY BUT WHETHER AFTER HE FINDS OUT HER VOICE CHOKED INTO SILENCE AND SHE TURNED HER HEAD QUITE AWAY THERE THERE DEAR DON'T YOU FRET SUSAN COMFORTED HER
AND LET IT PLAINLY BE SEEN THAT SHE HAD HIGH HOPES OF THE MONEY THESE POEMS WERE GOING TO BRING SHE DID NOT SET A PRICE SHE WOULD LEAVE THAT TO THEIR OWN INDISCRETION SHE SAID IN CLOSING IT WAS MIDNIGHT BEFORE SUSAN HAD COPIED THIS LETTER AND PREPARED THE TWO MANUSCRIPTS FOR MAILING
EVERYBODY HERE THAT COMES TO SEE ME TELLS ME THE LINES ARE THERE YES I KNOW THE GIRL'S VOICE WAS LOW A LITTLE BREATHLESS AND THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU SO MUCH
AN IF YOU WANT TO SEE A REAL SLAUGHTER HOUSE YOU JEST COME IN HERE SHE BECKONED HIM LEADING THE WAY TO THE STUDIO BUT BUT
THE BIG SOFA IN THE HALL DOWNSTAIRS AND THE DROPLEAF TABLE IN THE DINING ROOM HUMPH BUT WILL HE PAY ANYTHING FOR THEM THINGS
TURNED AWAY AND STUMBLED OUT OF THE KITCHEN SUSAN LOOKING AFTER HER DREW A LONG SIGH WORRY NEVER CLIMBED A HILL WORRY NEVER
YOU JEST WAIT THE FIRST ELEMENTAL THING IS TO LEARN HIM SELF DEFIANCE SO HE CAN DO THINGS FOR HIMSELF
DREAMILY FIXED OUT THE WINDOW NODDED HER HEAD SLOWLY YES I S'POSE SO BUT THERE'S A LOT LEFT THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT LEFT AND EVERYTHING HE WRITES I CAN JUST SEE IT WAS ALWAYS LIKE THAT WITH MY JOHN
SHE PAUSED DREW A LONG SIGH AND TURNED HER EYES OUT THE WINDOW UP THE WALK WAS COMING DANIEL BURTON HIS STEP WAS SLOW HIS HEAD WAS BOWED HE LOOKED LIKE ANYTHING BUT THE HAPPY POSSESSOR OF NEW WEALTH SUSAN FROWNED AS SHE WATCHED HIM
WEARILY INDIFFERENT AS TO EVERYTHING THAT WAS TAKING PLACE ABOUT HIM LAY MOTIONLESS AS USUAL HIS FACE TURNED TOWARD THE WALL AND AT TEN O'CLOCK MISSUS COLEBROOK WENT FIVE MINUTES LATER DANIEL BURTON ENTERED THE KITCHEN
AN DO YOU NOW RUN BACK TO THE SETTIN' ROOM I'VE GOT MY DINNER TO GET KEITH HAD NOT DISAPPEARED DOWN THE HALL HOWEVER BEFORE SUSAN WAS HALFWAY UP THE BACK STAIRS A MOMENT LATER SHE WAS IN THE STUDIO DANIEL BURTON
AT THE BURTON HOMESTEAD THE CHANGES DID NOT SEEM SO STUPENDOUS AFTER ALL TRUE DANIEL BURTON HAD ABANDONED THE PEDDLING OF PEAS AND BEANS ACROSS THE COUNTER AND HAD AT THE EARNEST SOLICITATION OF HIS SON GOT OUT HIS EASEL AND PLACED A FRESH CANVAS UPON IT
DON'T CALL HIM HE WON'T WANT TO SEE ME NOBODY WILL WANT TO SEE ME NOW I'M BLIND SUSAN BLIND SHUCKS EVERYBODY WILL WANT TO SEE YOU SO'S TO SEE HOW SPLENDID YOU ARE EVEN IF YOU ARE BLIND NOW DON'T TALK ANY MORE PLEASE DON'T THERE'S A GOOD BOY
SHE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN KEITH'S FRENZIED AVOIDANCE OF SUCH CALLERS IN THE OLD DAYS BUT TO HER SURPRISE NOW KEITH WELCOMED MAZIE JOYOUSLY SO JOYOUSLY THAT SUSAN BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT BEHIND THE JOYOUSNESS
WASN'T SHE HERSELF ALWAYS BRAGGIN ABOUT HIS BEIN SO BRAVE HUMPH THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS PLEASIN SOME FOLKS IT SEEMS FINISHED MISSUS MC GUIRE AS SHE ENTERED HER OWN DOOR BUT MISSUS MC GUIRE WAS NOT THE ONLY FREQUENT CALLER
WHY MISTER BURTON WHAT DO YOU MEAN IS KEITH WORSE CHATTERED SUSAN WITH DRY LIPS IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE HASH I TOOK UP HE SIMPLY WON'T EAT THAT OATMEAL STUFF AN' NO NO I DON'T MEAN THE HASH
AND PLAYING GAMES WITH ME WAS A GIRL I HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE A GIRL WHO WAS WHAT SHE PRETENDED TO BE A NEW FRIEND DOING IT ALL BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO BECAUSE SHE LIKED TO BUT KEITH I'M SURE THAT DOROTHY LIKED
I DON'T SAY THIS SORT OF THING VERY OFTEN I NEVER SAID IT BEFORE TO ANYBODY BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED JUST WHAT YOU WERE DOING ALL THOSE WEEKS FOR ME OUT THERE AT THE SANATORIUM
YOU CAN YOU CAN HOW MAKE HIM WRITE IT DOWN JEST AS HE TALKS HE CAN HE WANTS TO HE'S ALWAYS WANTED TO THEN PUBLISH IT IN A BOOK SO
THEN TIRED BUT HAPPY SHE WENT TO BED IT WAS THE NEXT DAY THAT THE NURSE WENT AND THAT MISSUS COLEBROOK CAME THE DOCTOR SAID THAT KEITH MIGHT BE DRESSED NOW ANY DAY THAT HE SHOULD BE DRESSED IN FACT AND BEGIN TO TAKE SOME EXERCISE
THEY LIKE THE DARK THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE FOR THEN THEY CAN BE GREAT THEY LOOM LIKE DOOM FROM OUT THE GLOOM AN SHRIEK I AM YOUR FATE BUT AFTER ALL THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE ARE COWARDS SAY NOT YOU
WHAT COULD YOU EXPECT SHE MUTTERED TO HERSELF AFTER A SORROWFUL MEDITATION BEFORE THE KITCHEN FIRE YOU CAN'T PUT A BACKBONE INTO A JELLYFISH BY JEST SHOWIN HIM THE BONE AN THAT'S WHAT HIS AUNT HAS MADE HIM
THOSE BILLS ARE DUE AND PAST DUE HE CRIED NERVOUSLY BEFORE SUSAN COULD SPEAK AND I HOPED TO HAVE THE MONEY BOTH FOR THEM AND FOR YOUR WAGES LONG BEFORE THIS BUT
UNTIL I COULD JUST SEE EM MYSELF I'LL NEVER FORGET ONE DAY HE WENT TO A FIRE THE OLD BABCOCK HOUSE BURNED AN HE SAW IT HE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD I WAS SICK IN BED AN HE TOLD ME ABOUT IT
LEADING THE WAY THROUGH THE DININGROOM IN THE KITCHEN SHE STOPPED AND TURNED EAGERLY
WHEN DANIEL BURTON THIS MORNING THEREFORE HEARD SUSAN SINGING THIS SONG HE WAS IN NO DOUBT AS TO SUSAN'S STATE OF MIND A FACT WHICH CERTAINLY DID NOT ADD TO HIS OWN SERENITY UPSTAIRS KEITH
AND SHE BEGAN TO READ THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE THEY COME AT NIGHT THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE AN GATHER ROUND MY BED THEY CLUSTER THICK ABOUT THE FOOT AN LEAN ON TOP THE HEAD
THAT EVENING SUSAN SOUGHT HER EMPLOYER IN THE STUDIO DANIEL BURTON SPENT ALL HIS WAKING HOURS IN THE STUDIO NOW THE WOODS AND FIELDS WERE NOTHING BUT A BARREN DESERT OF LONELINESS TO DANIEL BURTON WITHOUT KEITH THE VERY POISE OF SUSAN'S HEAD
DOCTOR STEWART CAME ON AGAIN TO TAKE HIS DAUGHTER BACK FOR THE HOLIDAYS HE CALLED AT ONCE TO SEE MISTER BURTON AND THE TWO HAD A LONG CONFERENCE IN THE STUDIO WHILE SUSAN FEVERISHLY MOVED FROM ROOM TO ROOM DOWNSTAIRS
HE SHOWED IT MISS DOROTHY I KNOW A SOFT PINK SUFFUSED THE YOUNG GIRL'S FACE BUT IT WAS MISS STEWART HE WAS GLAD TO SEE NOT DOROTHY PARKMAN AND AFTER THE THINGS HE SAID
HE WOULDN'T YOU DON'T KNOW JUST TO DAY HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT ABOUT SOME ONE WHO HAD TRIED TO DECEIVE HIM IN A LITTLE THING BECAUSE HE WAS BLIND AND I COULD SEE HOW BITTER HE WAS
I SUPPOSE THAT'S SO BUT I MIGHT GO DOWN AND SEE YES I'D DO THAT LATER ON YOU CAN COME OVER TO RUSH AND WILDER'S OFFICES THIS WAS AGREED TO AND AS SOON AS BREAKFAST WAS OVER
I CAN AND HOPE YOU WON'T PROSECUTE ME I WILL SEE THAT DORA S GETS SOMETHING TO EAT EVEN IF I GIVE HER MY SHARE THEY INTEND TO GO TO SAND HAVEN IF THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE SLIP
PUT IN SAM THEY COULDN'T HAVE SPIRITED HIM AWAY HE CAN'T BE FAR OFF SAID FRANK AGAIN WAS THE SEARCH RENEWED THE MEN HAD HAD ONE LARGE ROOM AND ONE SMALL APARTMENT
AND THIS THEY CLOSED AND SHOVED THE RUSTY BOLT INTO THE SOCKET IN A SECOND MORE THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY UPSTAIRS AGAIN
ARNOLD BAXTER SHOOK HIS HEAD I DON'T LIKE THIS IF THEY HAVE GOT WIND OF ANYTHING BUT HOW COULD THEY GET WIND PERSISTED BUDDY GIRK THAT WOULD REMAIN TO BE FOUND OUT
A BOAT IS DEAD AHEAD CAME SUDDENLY FROM DICK AND SERGEANT BROWN ALSO GAVE A CRY OF WARNING THEN CAME A SHOCK AND A CRASH AND A SPLINTERING OF WOOD FOLLOWED BY THE CRIES OF MEN AND BOYS AND THE SCREAMS OF A WOMAN AND A GIRL
IT WILL SERVE HIM RIGHT ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME GO DEMANDED DICK UNEASILY FOR HE SAW THAT THE TWO WERE PLOTTING TO DO HIM INJURY NO CAME FROM BOTH WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
AND RAN TO WHERE HE COULD NOT BE SEEN FROM THE OTHER YACHT HE PULLED FROM THE SEASHELL A SMALL SQUARE OF PAPER UPON WHICH HAD BEEN HASTILY SCRAWLED THE FOLLOWING IN LEAD PENCIL I WILL HELP YOU ALL
HIS FATHER'S WORST ENEMY WHO HAD BEEN LEFT AT THE HOSPITAL IN ITHACA WITH A BROKEN LIMB AND SEVERAL SMASHED RIBS BAXTER HAD TACKLED DICK WHILE THE TWO WERE ON A MOVING TRAIN AND WHILE TRYING TO THROW THE BOY OFF
WOULD YOU LEAVE HIM IN THIS ROOM I DON'T KNOW GIRK SCRATCHED HIS TANGLED HEAD OF HAIR NO I WOULDN'T I'LL TELL YOU WHERE TO TAKE HIM
LET ME GO CAME FROM DICK I HAVE DONE NO HARM I DINK YOU VOS VON SNEAK THIEF ALRETTY STAND STILL BIS I FIND OWIT IT'S DUTCH JAKE CRIED BUDDY GIRK
ALL OF THE BOYS WERE CONSIDERABLY EXCITED AND WONDERED IF IT WOULD BE BEST TO FOLLOW UP THE VANISHING PAIR
I HEARD EM CARRYIN ON IN THEIR ROOM A WHILE AGO WHICH ROOM IS IT PLEASE THERE YE ARE
WHEN A WOMAN SUDDENLY CONFRONTED HIM SHE WAS TALL AND HEAVY AND HAD A RED DISAGREEABLE FACE WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOMS YOUNG FELLOW SHE DEMANDED I'M TRYING TO GET OUT OF THIS HOUSE
AND WITH THEIR ARMS LOADED DOWN THEY HURRIED TO THE SEARCHLIGHT MARTIN HARRIS WAS ON HAND AND READY TO CAST OFF HULLO YOU DID LAY IN SOME THINGS HE GRINNED I RECKON YOU CALCULATE THIS CHASE TO LAST SOME TIME
TOM AND SAM PULLED THEMSELVES TOGETHER WITH LONG YAWNS SLEEPING IN A SEAT DOESN'T COME UP TO A BED BY ANY MEANS REMARKED TOM WHICH WAY NOW WE'LL GO DOWN TO THE RIVER AND LOOK FOR THE FLYAWAY
HERE'S SOMETHING OF A TRAP DOOR HE EXCLAIMED AS HE GAZED AT THE FLOORING ABOVE HEAD I WONDER IF I CAN GET OUT THAT WAY HE DROPPED THE LIGHTED SHAVING IN A SAFE SPOT AND PUT UP HIS HANDS
THEY HAVE SKIPPED FOR GOOD TAKE MY WORD ON IT MUTTERED TOM AND THE OTHERS AGREED WITH HIM
PERHAPS HE HAS FOUND SOMETHING OF INTEREST SUGGESTED FRANK AND PERHAPS HE HAS FALLEN INTO A TRAP PUT IN TOM I'VE A GOOD MIND TO HUNT HIM UP IF YOU GO I'LL GO WITH YOU SAID SAM
AND HERE PURCHASED SOME COFFEE SUGAR CANNED MEAT AND FISH A SMALL QUANTITY OF VEGETABLES AND ALSO SEVERAL LOAVES OF BREAD AND SOME SALT TO THIS TOM ADDED A BOX OF CRACKERS AND SAM SOME CAKE AND FRUIT
OPEN DER DOOR UND TOOK HIM INSIDE TOOK HIM INSIDE BURST OUT SAM AND TOM SIMULTANEOUSLY YAH REPLIED DUTCH JAKE BUT FAILED TO ADD THAT HE HAD HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CAPTURE
BUT HOW WHAT DO YOU WANT TO FOLLOW THE FLYAWAY FOR ASKED MARTIN HARRIS CURIOUSLY THOSE TWO BOYS ARE RUNNING AWAY WITH THAT GIRL IMPOSSIBLE NO IT ISN'T ONE OF THE FELLOWS
THE JAW OF THE LANDLORD DROPPED PERCEPTIBLY WHY ER I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SENATOR HARRINGTON'S SON HE STAMMERED I THINK IF YOU WISH TO KEEP OUT OF TROUBLE YOU HAD BEST AID US ALL YOU CAN
I'LL GET THE HORN AND RUNNING BELOW HE BROUGHT IT UP AND HE AND SAM TOOK TURNS AT BLOWING IT WITH ALL THE STRENGTH OF THEIR LUNGS ONE THING IS COMFORTING THOSE RASCALS ARE NO BETTER OFF THAN WE ARE
FROM A DARK LOOKING MAN ON THE FORWARD DECK CAN'T YOU TALK ENGLISH CRIED DICK A LEETLE WE ARE AFTER THAT OTHER SAIL BOAT
REMARKED SAM AS THE SEASHELL DROPPED AT HIS FEET THERE IS SOMETHING INSIDE OF THE SHELL SAID TOM A BIT OF PAPER PERHAPS IT'S A MESSAGE I'LL SOON SEE RETURNED HIS YOUNGER BROTHER
I THINK THEY WOULD BE EQUAL TO IT THEY WERE UP TO SOME GAME IT MIGHT BE RETURNED SENATOR HARRINGTON WITH INTEREST BUT HOW WOULD THOSE MEN OBTAIN THE COMBINATION OF RUSH AND WILDER'S SAFE
YOU KEEP QUIET OR I'LL RUN YOU IN REPLIED ONE OF THE POLICEMEN AND THE OLD MAN LOST NO TIME IN SLINKING OUT OF SIGHT
NO ANSWER CAME BACK AND HE CONTINUED HIS SEARCH THEN LIGHTING A MATCH HE MOUNTED THE RICKETY STAIRS AND CALLED OUT AGAIN PHAT ARE YE A RAISIN SUCH A ROW ABOUT
AND ALL BY HIMSELF OCCUPIED A GARRET ROOM OF THE TENEMENT AS SOON AS THE DOOR WAS LOCKED ARNOLD BAXTER FACED DICK NOW WILL YOU KEEP QUIET
I HOPE THOUGH WE RUN THE FLYAWAY DOWN BEFORE NOON CONCLUDED THE ELDER ROVER AS HE HOPPED ON BOARD LEAVING SAM TO STOW AWAY THE STORES AS HE SAW FIT DICK AND TOM SPRANG IN TO ASSIST MARTIN HARRIS
TO GIVE HER UP TO US WOULD HAVE BEEN NO HARDSHIP THAT'S IT PUT IN MARTIN HARRIS WELL
EJACULATED TOM WHEN THE PAIR HAD PASSED UP THE ALLEYWAY AND DON'T YOU KNOW WHO THE OTHER WAS DEMANDED SAM IT WAS DAN BAXTER'S FATHER IMPOSSIBLE SAM ARNOLD BAXTER IS IN THE HOSPITAL AND
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WHEN WE LEFT CEDARVILLE IN SUCH A HURRY I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW THINGS ARE GOING UP THERE MUSED DICK IT WILL BE TOO BAD IF JOSIAH CRABTREE SUCCEEDS IN MARRYING MISSUS STANHOPE WHILE WE ARE AWAY
THEN HIS FEET WERE FASTENED TOGETHER AND HE WAS ROLLED UP IN AN OLD BLANKET MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR AND THE WANT OF WASHING NOW COME ON BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE SPOTS US EXCLAIMED BAXTER
THERE IS A HORN IN THE CABIN PANTRY REPLIED MARTIN HARRIS WE MIGHT AS WELL BRING IT OUT IF WE ARE SUNK ONE OR MORE OF US WILL MOST LIKELY BE DROWNED
I DON'T THINK YOU ARE GOING TO FIND ANYTHING REMARKED CALEB YATES TO MY WAY OF THINKING THAT BOY MUST HAVE FOLLOWED THE TWO MEN WHEN THEY LEFT HE COULDN'T DO THAT WITHOUT OUR SEEING HIM SAID SAM
DID YOU MENTION A MAN NAMED MOONEY CRIED FREDERICKS I DID DO YOU KNOW THIS MOONEY PUT IN MISTER WILDER TO THE BOOKKEEPER
ANYTHING THAT WAS HANDY BUT OTHERWISE THEY WERE TO ATTEND TO THE SAILING OF THE SEARCHLIGHT PROVISIONS TO USE TOM'S WAY OF EXPRESSING IT WERE NOW
THE SEARCH BEGAN IMMEDIATELY SEVERAL OF THE INMATES OF THE TENEMENTS TAKING PART EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM GIRK AND BAXTER HAD OCCUPIED WAS TURNED TOPSY TURVY BUT NO TRACE OF DICK WAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT
BUT SOON GAVE UP THE CHASE DICK DID NOT STOP RUNNING UNTIL HE WAS SEVERAL BLOCKS AWAY THEN HE DROPPED INTO A WALK
I SAW EM BY ACCIDENT THEY HAD BEEN TO THE CONCERT BUT THEY DON'T BELONG HERE THEY LIVE ON A FARM CALLED VALLEY BROOK NEAR THE VILLAGE OF DEXTER'S CORNERS THEY WERE WITH ANOTHER BOY A WELL DRESSED CHAP MAYBE THEY ARE PAYING HIM A VISIT
HERE COMES ANOTHER STEAMER CRIED TOM PRESENTLY LOOK HERE WHY CAN'T WE GET SOME HELP FROM HER PERHAPS WE CAN BURST OUT DICK I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT LET US SIGNAL HER ANYWAY SUGGESTED SERGEANT BROWN
THE SAFE DOOR WAS FOUND CLOSED BUT UNLOCKED THEN THE THIEVES HAD THE COMBINATION PUT IN SAM MORE THAN LIKELY I WONDER IF BAXTER AND GIRK COMMITTED THAT CRIME CAME FROM DICK
OVER THE QUEEN'S GRAVE THERE APPEARED MOUNTED UPON A WOODEN HORSE THE GIANT MALAMBRUNO
AND WHEN WE QUIT THIS WORLD AND ARE PUT UNDERGROUND THE PRINCE TRAVELS BY AS NARROW A PATH AS THE JOURNEYMAN AND THE POPE'S BODY DOES NOT TAKE UP MORE FEET OF EARTH THAN THE SACRISTAN'S
WHO IS CALLED PAR EXCELLENCE
CONSIDER TOO THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
AND TOOK UP TRIFALDI THE TWELVE DUENNAS AND THE LADY CAME ON AT PROCESSION PACE THEIR FACES BEING COVERED WITH BLACK VEILS NOT TRANSPARENT ONES LIKE TRIFALDIN'S BUT SO CLOSE THAT THEY ALLOWED NOTHING TO BE SEEN THROUGH THEM AS SOON AS THE BAND OF DUENNAS WAS FULLY IN SIGHT
FROM WHOM ONE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED GOOD ADVICE INSTEAD OF FOUL ABUSE PIOUS WELL MEANT REPROOF REQUIRES A DIFFERENT DEMEANOUR AND ARGUMENTS OF ANOTHER SORT AT ANY RATE TO HAVE REPROVED ME IN PUBLIC AND SO ROUGHLY EXCEEDS THE BOUNDS OF PROPER REPROOF
AND YOU MUST KNOW BESIDES THAT THE TRUE KNIGHT ERRANT THOUGH HE MAY SEE TEN GIANTS THAT NOT ONLY TOUCH THE CLOUDS WITH THEIR HEADS BUT PIERCE THEM AND THAT GO EACH OF THEM ON TWO TALL TOWERS BY WAY OF LEGS AND WHOSE ARMS ARE LIKE THE MASTS OF MIGHTY SHIPS AND EACH EYE LIKE A GREAT MILL WHEEL
WHO HAD NOT SO LARGE A SHARE OF THE GIFTS OF FORTUNE AS OF NATURE FOR IF THE TRUTH BE TOLD UNGRUDGINGLY HE IS THE MOST AGILE YOUTH WE KNOW A MIGHTY THROWER OF THE BAR A FIRST RATE WRESTLER AND A GREAT BALL PLAYER HE RUNS LIKE A DEER AND LEAPS BETTER THAN A GOAT
WHICH I LOOK UPON AS BROKEN AND SPLIT ALREADY THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO FIGHT THAT I HAVE NO SWORD FOR I NEVER CARRIED ONE IN MY LIFE
THERE ARE TWO ROADS MY DAUGHTERS BY WHICH MEN MAY REACH WEALTH AND HONOURS ONE IS THAT OF LETTERS THE OTHER THAT OF ARMS
A COMPANY OF SOLDIERS PASSED THROUGH HERE WHEN THEY LEFT THEY TOOK AWAY WITH THEM THREE OF THE GIRLS OF THE VILLAGE I WILL NOT TELL THEE WHO THEY ARE
AND TO BRING HER TO LIFE AGAIN THEY MUST GIVE ME FOUR AND TWENTY SMACKS AND PRICK HOLES IN MY BODY WITH PINS AND RAISE WEALS ON MY ARMS WITH PINCHES TRY THOSE JOKES ON A BROTHER IN LAW I'M AN OLD DOG AND TUS TUS
AND HE TO REVENGE THE DEATH OF HIS COUSIN PUNISH THE AUDACITY OF DON CLAVIJO
WHEN IT WAS HE HIMSELF WHO HAD BEEN THE ENCHANTER AND TRICKSTER IN THE BUSINESS HAVING THEREFORE INSTRUCTED THEIR SERVANTS IN EVERYTHING THEY WERE TO DO SIX DAYS AFTERWARDS THEY TOOK HIM OUT TO HUNT
SO SAD SO DEEP AND SO DOLEFUL THAT SHE PUT ALL WHO HEARD AND SAW HER INTO A STATE OF PERPLEXITY
WHO ARE YOU WHERE ARE YOU GOING WHAT TROOPS ARE THESE THAT SEEM TO BE PASSING THROUGH THE WOOD TO WHICH THE COURIER REPLIED IN A HARSH DISCORDANT VOICE I AM THE DEVIL I AM IN SEARCH OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA
BUT BRINGING WITH IT A KIND OF HAZE THAT GREATLY AIDED THE PROJECT OF THE DUKE AND DUCHESS AND THUS AS NIGHT BEGAN TO FALL AND A LITTLE AFTER TWILIGHT SET IN SUDDENLY THE WHOLE WOOD ON ALL FOUR SIDES SEEMED TO BE ON FIRE
THY ADVICE IS NOT BAD SAID DON QUIXOTE FOR OF ENEMIES THE FEWER THE BETTER
BUT WITH DELIVERING JUDGMENTS AND GIVING OPINIONS AND MAKING LAWS AND PROCLAMATIONS JUST AS SLEEP IN SPITE OF HUNGER WAS BEGINNING TO CLOSE HIS EYELIDS HE HEARD SUCH A NOISE OF BELL RINGING AND SHOUTING
THAT DON QUIXOTE SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO AS IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO RESTRAIN HIM AND THAT SAMSON SHOULD SALLY FORTH TO MEET HIM AS A KNIGHT ERRANT AND DO BATTLE WITH HIM FOR THERE WOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY ABOUT A CAUSE AND VANQUISH HIM
AND IT'S NOT FROM ANY CRAVING TO QUIT MY OWN HUMBLE CONDITION OR BETTER MYSELF BUT FROM THE DESIRE I HAVE TO TRY WHAT IT TASTES LIKE TO BE A GOVERNOR
I SHOULD BE GLAD IF THE SENOR GOVERNOR WOULD RELIEVE ME OF CERTAIN DOUBTS I HAVE RISING OUT OF THE HISTORY OF THE GREAT DON QUIXOTE THAT IS NOW IN PRINT ONE IS INASMUCH AS WORTHY SANCHO NEVER SAW DULCINEA
NOT TO SAY TWO BUT TWO THOUSAND PROVERBS
BUT IT WAS ALL PREACHING IN THE DESERT AND HAMMERING COLD IRON NEVERTHELESS AMONG MANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO HIM THE HOUSEKEEPER SAID TO HIM IN TRUTH MASTER IF YOU DO NOT KEEP STILL AND STAY QUIET AT HOME
DEMONS OF MY SORT BE WITH THEE AND GOOD ANGELS WITH THESE GENTLES AND SO SAYING HE BLEW HIS HUGE HORN TURNED ABOUT AND WENT OFF WITHOUT WAITING FOR A REPLY FROM ANYONE
HE CARRIED A MOORISH CUTLASS HANGING FROM A BROAD GREEN AND GOLD BALDRIC THE BUSKINS WERE OF THE SAME MAKE AS THE BALDRIC THE SPURS WERE NOT GILT BUT LACQUERED GREEN AND SO BRIGHTLY POLISHED THAT MATCHING AS THEY DID THE REST OF HIS APPAREL
EVEN THOUGH HE KNOW HIM NOT WILL FAIL TO RECOGNISE AND SET HIM DOWN AS ONE OF GOOD BLOOD AND IT WOULD BE STRANGE WERE IT NOT SO PRAISE HAS EVER BEEN THE REWARD OF VIRTUE AND THOSE WHO ARE VIRTUOUS CANNOT FAIL TO RECEIVE COMMENDATION
THE FOOL KNOWS MORE IN HIS OWN HOUSE THAN THE WISE MAN IN ANOTHER'S NAY SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE THE FOOL KNOWS NOTHING EITHER IN HIS OWN HOUSE OR IN ANYBODY ELSE'S FOR NO WISE STRUCTURE OF ANY SORT CAN STAND ON A FOUNDATION OF FOLLY
IF YOUR LORDSHIP WOULD BE SO GOOD AS TO GIVE ME EVER SO SMALL A BIT OF HEAVEN WERE IT NO MORE THAN HALF A LEAGUE I'D RATHER HAVE IT THAN THE BEST ISLAND IN THE WORLD RECOLLECT SANCHO SAID THE DUKE I CANNOT GIVE A BIT OF HEAVEN
IF SO BE YOUR WORSHIP IS GOING OUR ROAD AND HAS NO OCCASION FOR SPEED IT WOULD BE A PLEASURE TO ME IF WE WERE TO JOIN COMPANY IN TRUTH REPLIED HE ON THE MARE
TURN THINE EYES AND LOOK AND THOU WILT SEE STRETCHED THERE A KNIGHT ERRANT WHO IT STRIKES ME IS NOT OVER AND ABOVE HAPPY FOR I SAW HIM FLING HIMSELF OFF HIS HORSE
I GAVE YOU AN ACCOUNT OF THE INJUSTICE AND TREACHERY OF A WICKED FARMER TO MY DEARLY BELOVED DAUGHTER THE UNHAPPY DAMSEL HERE BEFORE YOU AND YOU PROMISED ME TO TAKE HER PART AND RIGHT THE WRONG THAT HAS BEEN DONE HER
AND DRESSED IN A GABAN OF FINE GREEN CLOTH WITH TAWNY VELVET FACINGS AND A MONTERA OF THE SAME VELVET THE TRAPPINGS OF THE MARE WERE OF THE FIELD AND JINETA FASHION AND OF MULBERRY COLOUR AND GREEN
THAN TOUCHED THE THRACIAN STRING BUT NOT IN LIFE ALONE METHINKS TO ME BELONGS THE OFFICE LADY WHEN MY TONGUE IS COLD IN DEATH BELIEVE ME UNTO THEE MY VOICE SHALL RAISE ITS TRIBUTARY SONG
SO HE RAN AFTER HIS MASTER HOLDING ON TO ROCINANTE'S STIRRUP LEATHER AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HIM TIME TO TURN ABOUT HE SAID I IMPLORE OF YOUR WORSHIP SENOR BEFORE YOU TURN TO CHARGE TO HELP ME UP INTO THIS CORK TREE
WERE WATCHING HIM AND AS THEY SAW HIM THERE WITH HALF A YARD OF NECK AND THAT UNCOMMONLY BROWN HIS EYES SHUT AND HIS BEARD FULL OF SOAP IT WAS A GREAT WONDER AND ONLY BY GREAT DISCRETION THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO RESTRAIN THEIR LAUGHTER THE DAMSELS THE CONCOCTERS OF THE JOKE
I HOPE TO YIELD FRUIT IN ABUNDANCE THAT WILL NOT FALL AWAY OR SLIDE FROM THOSE PATHS OF GOOD BREEDING THAT YOUR WORSHIP HAS MADE IN MY PARCHED UNDERSTANDING DON QUIXOTE LAUGHED AT SANCHO'S AFFECTED PHRASEOLOGY
I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT MY DESTINY OR MORE PROPERLY SPEAKING MY CHOICE
SANCHO AT LAST FELL ASLEEP AT THE FOOT OF A CORK TREE WHILE DON QUIXOTE DOZED AT THAT OF A STURDY OAK BUT A SHORT TIME ONLY HAD ELAPSED WHEN A NOISE HE HEARD BEHIND HIM AWOKE HIM AND RISING UP
IS THE ONE THAT IS DECEIVED AND THAT THERE IS NO MORE REASON TO DOUBT THE TRUTH OF THIS THAN OF ANYTHING ELSE WE NEVER SAW SENOR SANCHO PANZA MUST KNOW THAT WE TOO HAVE ENCHANTERS HERE
BUT HE DID NOT LIKE TO REPLY LEST HE SHOULD SAY SOMETHING THAT MIGHT DISCLOSE HIS TRICKERY AS THEY WERE ENGAGED IN THIS CONVERSATION THEY WERE OVERTAKEN BY A MAN WHO WAS FOLLOWING THE SAME ROAD BEHIND THEM MOUNTED ON A VERY HANDSOME FLEA BITTEN MARE
BUT ONE'S DRESS MUST BE SUITED TO THE OFFICE OR RANK ONE HOLDS FOR IT WOULD NOT DO FOR A JURIST TO DRESS LIKE A SOLDIER OR A SOLDIER LIKE A PRIEST YOU SANCHO SHALL GO PARTLY AS A LAWYER PARTLY AS A CAPTAIN FOR IN THE ISLAND I AM GIVING YOU
ANOTHER COMES UP AND STRIKES HIM AND AFTER STRIKING HIM TAKES TO FLIGHT WITHOUT WAITING AN INSTANT AND THE OTHER PURSUES HIM BUT DOES NOT OVERTAKE HIM HE WHO RECEIVED THE BLOW RECEIVED AN OFFENCE BUT NOT AN INSULT BECAUSE AN INSULT MUST BE MAINTAINED IF HE WHO STRUCK HIM
FROM SAYING TO DOING BE THAT AS IT MAY SAID SANCHO PLEDGES DON'T DISTRESS A GOOD PAYER AND HE WHOM GOD HELPS DOES BETTER THAN HE WHO GETS UP EARLY AND
BUT AS YOU SAY ENCHANTERS PERSECUTE YOU I WILL NOT VENTURE TO SAY POSITIVELY WHETHER YOU ARE THE SAID PERSON OR NOT THAT SAID DON QUIXOTE IS ENOUGH TO CONVINCE ME THAT YOU ARE UNDER A DECEPTION HOWEVER ENTIRELY TO RELIEVE YOU OF IT
HE ARRANGED A MATCH FOR HIS DAUGHTER WITH THE RICH CAMACHO
AND THEN WHEN THEY CONDESCEND TO COMPOSE A SORT OF VERSE THAT WAS AT THAT TIME IN VOGUE IN KANDY WHICH THEY CALL SEGUIDILLAS
MOWNOTH HE EXCLAIMED HIS EYES RAISED FERVENTLY IF IT BE THY WILL TO DELIVER US GIVE US THE SECRET THIS NIGHT MEANWHILE IN ROLLA'S HUT A SIMILAR SCENE WAS GOING ON UNDER THE DOCTOR'S PROJECTED EYE
IN FACT IRON PYRITES IS OFTEN CALLED FOOL GOLD SO DECEPTIVE IS ITS GLITTER YET IT WAS JUST THE THING FOR THE PURPOSE FLINT THEY ALREADY HAD LARGE QUANTITIES OF IT PRACTICALLY ALL THEIR TOOLS SUCH AS AXES AND KNIVES WERE MADE OF IT
IS ALSO PROBABLY A MEMBER OF THE LEISURE CLASS ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAVE SMITH'S AGENT WHOSE NAME WE DO NOT KNOW HE SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE WORKING CLASS WHICH POWART DESPISES
THAT I HAD SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN GOOD NIGHT YOU AREN'T HIS VOICE WAS STRAINED AND EXCITED MONA YOU JUST NOW SAID SOMETHING OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY SURELY INCREDULOUSLY YOU RECALL SAYING SOMETHING DON'T YOU
A FEW MINUTES LATER BILLIE THROUGH MONA KNEW THAT FORT WAS REPORTING PROGRESS HE DID IT BY TELEPHONE THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW HE FINISHED HOPE I DIDN'T ROUSE YOU OUT OF BED
AND SEEMINGLY COVERED WITH FROST FOR IT SPARKLED SO BRIGHTLY IN THE SUN AS TO ACTUALLY HURT THE EYES IN FACT THE GEOLOGIST'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS A GLACIER
WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS POWART NEARLY NORMAL THE PERCENTAGE OF OVERHEAD IS ONLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN AVERAGE UNTIL ERNOL MOVED INTO THE LOCALITY EVERY ONE SEEMED CONTENTED WITH THE REGULAR ARRANGEMENTS
THE OLDER WOMAN'S LIPS TREMBLED DESPITE THEMSELVES AND SHE SAID NOTHING FURTHER BEYOND A BRIEF SLEEP WELL AFTER WHICH THE TWO WOMEN TURNED IN AND SHORTLY REACHED THE DROWSY POINT THUS IT HAPPENED THAT ROLLA AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO
EVEN THOUGH VAN EMMON COULD NOT SAY WHETHER THE VEGETATION WERE TREE SHRUB OR PLANT IT WAS CERTAINLY THE WORK OF MAN OR SOME THING MIGHTILY LIKE MAN SHORTLY
IT IS QUITE WITHIN MY POWER TO DISPOSE OF YOUR OPPOSITION SIGNIFICANTLY QUITE SO I SHALL APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION ALSO THEN THE ATHLETE PERMITTED HIMSELF A SLIGHT SMILE ON SECOND THOUGHTS HOWEVER
DURING THE EATING OF WHICH THE TWO MEN BECAME PRETTY FRIENDLY YOU'RE DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF THE FOLKS OF YOUR STATION REBLONG FINALLY MADE BOLD TO REMARK ANY HARM IN MY SAYING SO ON THE CONTRARY LAUGHED THE ATHLETE
THE REBEL MEANWHILE BILLIE WAS STILL HAUNTING MONA AND SHORTLY WAS ABLE TO TELL THE OTHER THREE THAT FORT HAD CALLED TAKING THE SURGEON OUT IN A MACHINE LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD THEM BOTH
FEAR NOT I HAVE NO FEELING FOR THY CUNORA I MAY MARRY HER BUT AS FOR FATHERING HER CHILDREN NO SUPPOSE THROUGH SET TEETH SUPPOSE THEY SHOULD THREATEN TO KILL THEE I SHOULD RATHER DIE DULNOP THAN BE UNTRUE TO ROLLA
TWENTY FIVE HOUR DIAL AND A PENDULUM OF THE USUAL LENGTH SAME AS YOURS
A VERITABLE ROAR AS THOUGH THE THING WAS BEING WRENCHED FROM THE HEART OF THE EARTH FROM SOMEWHERE ON TOP CAME A SPURT OF WATER THAT SPLASHED JUST BESIDE THE CRAFT THEN
IS NOT UNKNOWN TO CERTAIN FORMS OF EARTH'S INSECT LIFE I MEAN A SOLDIER TYPE A KIND OF BEE WHICH SPECIALIZES ON FIGHTING VAN EMMON WAS LISTENING CLOSELY
FOR HE TOOK FLIGHT AS SOON AS HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE PIT AND HE LEFT HALF A MILLION IN GOLD BEHIND HIM THIS NEW FLIGHT HAD NOT LASTED TWO MINUTES BEFORE THE GEOLOGIST BEGAN TO NOTE OTHER OBJECTS IN THE AIR
SHE CONCEDED IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE SMITH HAD BEEN THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE I ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THAT A BEE'S STINGING APPARATUS IS GOOD FOR ONLY ONE ATTACK
ALWAYS IN SYMPATHY WITH THE UPPER DOG MISTER VAN EMMON I AM HOTLY THEN WITH THE MEMORY OF WHAT HE HAD JUST SEEN RUSHING BACK UPON HIM I MEAN I WAS
IT WAS AN EXTRAORDINARILY INGENIOUS THING WITH LITTLE OR NO PLOT AFTERWARD SMITH COULD NOT DESCRIBE IT WITH ANY ACCURACY HOWEVER MISSUS KINNEY DOWN STAIRS PLAINLY HEARD HIM LAUGHING AS THOUGH HIS SIDES WOULD GIVE WAY
THEY WERE MERE CHILDREN ALL TOLD IT WAS OVER TWO HOURS BEFORE THE PUNK BEGAN TO SMOLDER BY MOWNOTH SWORE THE HERDSMAN STARING REVERENTLY AT THE SMOKE WE HAVE DONE A MIRACLE DULNOP YE AND I
JUST SUCH STARS AS SHALL AWAKEN THE SEED OF THE FLOWER YE SHALL SEE BOTH KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO LOOK FOR THE BRASSY REGULARLY CUT CRYSTALS WITH THE BLACK STRIPINGS SUCH AS HAS LED COUNTLESS MEN TO GO THROUGH UNTOLD HARDSHIPS IN THE BELIEF THAT THEY HAD FOUND GOLD
WHEN MAN RANKED NO HIGHER THAN OTHERS I FEEL SURE OF THIS HE INSISTED SEEING THAT SMITH WAS OPPOSED TO THE IDEA AND I THINK I KNOW JUST WHAT OCCURRED TO MAKE MAN SUPREME WHAT
PERSONALLY I THINK WE ARE MIGHTY LUCKY INSTEAD OF FOOLISH LUCKY THE OTHER MAN SNORTED
THEY ALL ADMIT THAT THINGS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SHOULD BE BUT NOBODY CARES HE WENT TO THE DOOR AND REBLONG HEARD HIM SAY UNDER HIS BREATH AS HE TURNED THE KNOB GREAT HEAVENS
I DON'T LIKE TO QUESTION YOUR WORD MISTER FORT REBLONG WAS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BUT I HAVE SUCH CONFIDENCE IN THE COMMISSION THAT WELL YOU UNDERSTAND AND FORT SAID JUST AS THE OTHER FELLOW HAD SAID AFTER TALKING WITH REBLONG
THE NATURAL COLORING AND STEREOSCOPIC EFFECT THAT THE DOCTOR HAD ALREADY NOTED THROUGH YOUNG ERNOL SMITH NEARLY OVERLOOKED THE REALLY FINE MUSIC ALL COMING FROM A TALKING MACHINE OF SOME KIND AND THEN THE PICTURE CAME TO AN END AND A FARCE COMEDY BEGAN
THE OLDER MAN DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO HIDE HIS DELIGHT HE GRABBED HIS COMPANION AND HUGGED HIM UNTIL HIS RIBS BEGAN TO CRACK THEN WITH A SINGLE BLOW FROM HIS HUGE CLUB THE HERDSMAN KNOCKED THE SPECIMEN CLEAR OF THE SLATE IN WHICH IT WAS SET
AS HE BUTTONED THEM UP AROUND THE NECK HE STEPPED IN FRONT OF A GLASS SMITH WAS NEARLY FLOORED THE MAN WAS ALMOST HIS EXACT DOUBLE AN ORDINARY EVERYDAY SORT OF A CHAP WITH A VERY COMMONPLACE FACE
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO BE OTHER THAN CONSIDERATE IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME NOW MISS MONA WILL NATURALLY THINK OF YOU FOR SHE KNOWS I HAVE COME HERE A SINGLE EXCLAMATION ESCAPED POWART
THIS MAKES EVERYTHING VERY DIFFERENT HE DECLARED AND EVEN HIS VOICE WAS ALTERED THERE WAS A DETERMINED PURPOSEFUL RING ABOUT IT WHICH WAS ALTOGETHER UNLIKE HIS USUAL RECKLESS TONES THANKS FOR NOT TELLING MISTER POWART
IT WAS STRIKING TO HEAR THIS BIT OF MODERN PSYCHOLOGY UTTERED BY THIS PRIMITIVE WOMAN LET ME HEAR NO MORE OF THY WEEPING YE SHALL NOT BE MADE TO WED CORRUS NEVERTHELESS AT THE SPEAKING OF HER LOVER'S NAME
WHAT GETS ME IS WHY THE HUMANS HAVE ALLOWED SUCH AN INFERNAL THING TO HAPPEN BILLIE SMILED SOMEWHAT SARDONICALLY I THOUGHT SHE REMARKED CUTTINGLY THAT YOU WERE
WITH THE BIRDS TO IMITATE AND EXTRA DENSE AIR ALL ABOUT THEM I THINK WE HAVE FOUND THE KEY THE DOCTOR COGITATED FOR A SECOND OR TWO HOWEVER LET'S CONSIDER THAT SCHOOLROOM A BIT
I ADMIT THEM ALL AND AT THE SAME TIME I WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ACCOMPLISHED ALL THIS NOT PRIMARILY FOR OUR BENEFIT BUT IN THE INTERESTS OF THE OWNERS THEY GAVE US PROHIBITION BECAUSE DRINKING WAS BAD FOR BUSINESS
AS HAPPY AS I AM AND THUS FORT DISCOVERED JUST AS ANOTHER MAN HAD ALREADY DISCOVERED THAT THE AVERAGE CAPELLAN WORKMAN WAS ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH WHAT HE KNEW TO BE UNJUST TREATMENT
OF COMMUNITY LIFE AND SPECIALIZATION OF COURSE WHEN YOU COME TO ANALYZE THESE TWO POINTS YOU SEE THAT THEY REALLY BELONG TO ONE ANOTHER
SHOW GREATER INDUSTRY YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY DEMANDED SMITH
SENT OUT A MESSAGE WHICH WAS READ AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS RECEIVED BY VAN EMMON'S AGENT AND AS UNCONSCIOUSLY TRANSLATED NUMBER EIGHT HUNDRED FOUR YOU ARE WANTED ON PLOT SEVENTEEN WHEREUPON
OF HUMAN OCCUPANCY ALL ARGUED THAT THE TWO MEN HAD HIT UPON THE SAME TYPE OF AGENT IN VAN EMMON'S CASE HOWEVER HE COULD OCCASIONALLY GLIMPSE TWO LOOSE PARTS OF THE MACHINE
THE BIRDS THAT SMITH AND HE HAD SEEN HAD NOT BEEN BIRDS AT ALL BUT AIRCRAFT BUILT IN IMITATION OF THEM
FORT CALLED UPON THE SELF MADE COMMANDER IN CHIEF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD I HAVE THE HONOR TO INFORM YOU SAID FORT COMING STRAIGHT TO THE POINT THAT MISS MONA HAS SEEN FIT TO ENCOURAGE MY SUIT
THERE WAS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT THEY WERE WIRELESS ANTENNAE FOR PRESENTLY THE NEWCOMER
WITHIN A WEEK I SHALL KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE CREW BY WIRELESS AND ADVISE YOU OF THEIR PROGRESS FROM TIME TO TIME
THAT HE WAS DEAD SURE OF WHAT HE SAW HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN WANTING TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE RESTING ON THE SOLID EARTH WAS A HUMAN HEAD ABOUT FIFTY YARDS WIDE AND
BUT WHETHER IN SOME SENSE YOU BELIEVE OR NOT THE FACT REMAINS THAT WHILE YOU ARE NOT OF THOSE CHRISTIANS WHO OBEY THE WORD OF THE MASTER DOING THE THINGS HE SAYS TO THEM YOU ARE OF THOSE CHRISTIANS
HAD SHE NOT DONE ENOUGH WOULD EVEN HER FATHER REQUIRE MORE OF HER THAN SHE HAD ALREADY DONE AND ENDURED
TO STAND UP IN THAT PULPIT AND SPEAK ABOUT MYSELF I WHO EVEN IF I HAD ANY OPINIONS COULD NEVER SEE REASON FOR PRESENTING THEM TO OTHER PEOPLE IT'S MY OFFICE IS IT NOT ME
AND WAS ONLY ABOUT HIS DINNER HIS EYES OVER FLOWED BUT HE SHUT HIS LIPS SO TIGHT THAT HIS MOUTH GREW GRIM WITH DETERMINATION AND NO MORE TEARS CAME TO THE FRIEND WHO JOINED HER AT THE CHURCH DOOR AND IN GEORGE
FOOLISH ANCESTORS AND WHICH HAVE BEEN INSTILLED INTO HIM AS WELL WITH HIS EARLIEST NOURISHMENT BOTH BODILY AND MENTAL BUT COME NOW I DO LOVE OPEN DEALING I AM MYSELF OPEN AS THE DAY
OR MISSING HIM GLOOMED BACK INTO THE LAND OF VISIONS THE TENDERNESS OF THE CURATE'S SERVICE THE HEART THAT SHOWED ITSELF IN EVERYTHING HE DID EVEN IN THE TURN AND EXPRESSION OF THE MINISTERING HAND
INTO THE LIFE I HOPE YOUR BROTHER WILL ENTER I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T HATE HIM HATE HIM WHO BUT A DEMON COULD HATE HIM HELEN LIFTED A GRATEFUL LOOK FROM EYES THAT SWAM IN TEARS
FOR THE MORE LOVELY ANYTHING I SAW
AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT I DID DIE AND AWAKE TO THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A BLESSED FREEDOM FROM THE COARSER AND MORE PONDEROUS OUTER DRESS
NEITHER OF THEM CARED TO DRINK MORE THAN A COUPLE OF GLASSES THEY SOON REJOINED THE LADIES IN THE DRAWING ROOM MISSUS RAMSHORN WAS TAKING HER USUAL FORTY WINKS IN HER ARM CHAIR AND THEIR ENTRANCE DID NOT DISTURB HER
AND THEREFORE COULD NOT KNOW THE FRIGHTFUL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A CONFESSION AS HE HAD COUNSELLED HAD SHE NOT BETTER THEN TELL HIM ALL AND SO GATHER FROM HIM SOME RIGHT AND REASONABLE ADVICE FOR THE SOOTHING OF THE AGONIES OF HER POOR BROKEN WINGED ANGEL
AFRICAN EXPLORERS PYRAMID INSPECTORS AND SUCH LIKE BUT FOR EVERY MAN AND WOMAN BORN INTO THE BLINDNESS OF THE PLANET IS TO DISCOVER AFTER WHICH DISCOVERY THERE IS
AND THEMSELVES WHO WRITE THEM MORE HARM THAN ANYBODY CONFIRMING THEM IN TEARFUL HABITS AND TEACHING EYES UNUSED TO WEEP
UGH I SAW IT IN THE MIRROR HIS VOICE HAD RISEN TO A STRANGLED SHRIEK HIS FACE WAS DISTORTED
AND INSIST ON THEIR BECOMING SOMETHING WORTH BEING BUT THAT THEY WERE IMMORTAL NOTWITHSTANDING THAT DEATH WAS ONLY THE PASSAGE OF ANOTHER BIRTH INTO A CONDITION OF ENLARGED CAPACITY
AND HE SAID NO I AM NOT EXACTLY PRAYING FOR HIM BUT I AM THINKING OF GOD AND HIM TOGETHER THE TEARS ROSE IN LEOPOLD'S EYES RACHEL LIFTED HER BABY HAND
ENOUGH TO SHOW US HOW HE SHOWED THE CONGREGATION THE STATE OF HIS MIND IN REFERENCE TO THE GRAND QUESTION AND THE POSITION HE TOOK IN RELATION TO HIS HEARERS
HAD THE CURATE BEEN A MAN SHE LIKED SHE WOULD NOT PERHAPS HAVE MINDED IT SO MUCH YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT ME NOW SHE SAID SADLY I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND TAKING TO PEOPLE AT FIRST SIGHT SOME PEOPLE ARE MADE SO I SUPPOSE HELEN
BUT SHE MUST TAKE CARE THAT FOOLISH EXTRAVAGANT CURATE SHOULD NOT COME NEAR HIM THERE WAS NO KNOWING TO WHAT HE MIGHT PERSUADE HIM POOR POLDIE WAS SO EASILY LED BY ANY SHOW OF NOBILITY ANYTHING THAT LOOKED GRAND OR SELF SACRIFICING
EVERY ONE OF WHICH NATURE FITS FOR A QUEEN BUT ITS NURSES PREVENT FROM GROWING ONE BY PROVIDING FOR IT A CELL TOO NARROW FOR THE UNROLLING OF ROYALTY
HERE THE ANSWER WAS NOT SO PLAIN AND THE CURATE HAD TO THINK AT LEAST HE SAID AT LENGTH YOU COULD CONFESS THE WRONG AND ASK FORGIVENESS
AND NO SHEPHERD AT THIS MOMENT RACHEL ENTERED WITH A SMALL TEA TRAY SHE COULD CARRY ONLY LITTLE THINGS AND A FEW AT A TIME SHE CAST A GLANCE OF ALMOST LOVING SOLICITUDE AT THE YOUNG MAN
AND WALKED WITH HIM THROUGH THE GARDEN WINGFOLD DID NOT SPEAK YOU DON'T THINK VERY BADLY OF MY POOR BROTHER DO YOU MISTER WINGFOLD SAID HELEN MEEKLY IT IS A TERRIBLE FATE HE RETURNED
BECAUSE I WANT TO BE NEAR YOU FATHER IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY COME NEARER STILL COME TO MY BOSOM MY CHILD AND BE YET HAPPIER TALK NOT OF PUBLIC WORSHIP AS DIVINE SERVICE IT IS A MOCKERY
BUT GOD KNOWS ABOUT US ALL THE SAME AND HE DON'T LIMIT HIS GOODNESS TO US BY OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HIM IT'S SO WONDERFUL
AND AGAIN I SPREAD WINGS NO LONGER AS IT SEEMED OF HOPE BUT WINGS OF DESPAIR YET MIGHTY AND FLEW AND I LEARNED THEREAFTER
I WOULD NOW IN MY TURN RIGHT GLADLY DIE FOR HER YET WOULD I NOT LOOK UPON THAT WOMAN AGAIN IF THE LOVE OF HER WOULD MAKE ME LOVE THEE ONE HAIR THE LESS THOU KNOWEST AND THE LORD SMILED UPON ME AND SAID
I AM GLAD THE MASON WORK IS TO YOUR MIND RETURNED BASCOMBE ALMOST COMPASSIONATELY IT MUST BE SOME SATISFACTION PERHAPS CONSOLATION TO YOU
BUT AS I HAVE SAID ESCAPED THE SNARE IN A VERY DIRECT AND SIMPLE FASHION SHE WENT FAST ASLEEP AND NEVER WOKE TILL HER MAID BROUGHT HER THE CUP OF KITCHEN TEA FROM WHICH THE INMATES OF SOME HOUSES DERIVE THE STRENGTH
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PROPHECY I MEAN
THAT YOU HOLD AND PRESENT SUCH A WITHERED STARVED MISERABLE DEATH'S HEAD IDEA OF CHRISTIANITY THAT YOU ARE YOURSELVES SUCH POVERTY STRICKEN BELIEVERS IF BELIEVERS YOU ARE AT ALL
THE LOOK OF A SAGE BUT ONE WHO HAS MADE NO DISCOVERY SHE HAD JUST FINISHED THE NOVEL OF THE DAY AND WAS SUFFERING A MILD REACTION THE MILDER PERHAPS
WHILE SHE FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF SHAME AND PITY FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY AS SHE HAD SAID TO HERSELF HAD PURSUED A COURSE WHICH IF SUCCESSFUL WOULD AT BEST HAVE RESULTED IN SHUTTING HIM UP AS IN A MADHOUSE
A SHOWER AS FROM A WATERING POT FALLING UPON THE LILY AND I LOOKED YET AGAIN AND I SAW THE WATERING POT AND THE HAND THAT HELD IT AND HE WHOSE HAND HELD THE POT STOOD BY ME
IDLE PEOPLE HAVE STILL LESS THAT THEIR MEANS OF GRACE AS THE THEOLOGIANS SAY ARE CONFINED TO DISCIPLINE WITHOUT NOURISHMENT WHENCE THEIR RELIGION IF THEY HAVE ANY
YEA ALL GRAND DISCOVERY FOR THINGS MUST BE FORESEEN ERE THEY CAN BE REALIZED APPREHENDED ERE THEY BE COMPREHENDED THIS MUCH HE COULD SAY FOR HIMSELF AND NO MORE THAT HE WAS READY TO LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR THE MERE CHANCE
THE BISHOP HAD HEARD NOTHING OF THE MATTER AND IF ANYTHING HAD REACHED THE RECTOR HE HAD NOT SPOKEN NOT ONE OF THE CONGREGATION NOT EVEN MISSUS RAMSHORN HAD HINTED TO HIM THAT HE OUGHT TO RESIGN
IMAGINED IT CAME FROM HIS OWN SPIRIT AND MUST THEREFORE BE OBEYED AS THE WILL OF GOD SO SAID THE SNAKE AND BY THE TIME HELEN HAD WALKED HOME WITH HER AUNT THE GLOW HAD SUNK FROM HER SOUL AND
WAS THIS WHAT CAME OF PRAYING SHE THOUGHT BITTERLY SOMETHING OR OTHER I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY RETURNED LEOPOLD OH HELEN HE BROKE OUT WITH A CRY STIFLED BY THE CAUTION THAT HAD GROWN HABITUAL TO BOTH OF THEM
CHAPTER FOUR THEIR TALK DURING DINNER BASCOMBE HAD THE TALK MOSTLY TO HIMSELF AND RATTLED WELL OCCASIONALLY REBUKED BY HIS AUNT FOR SOME REMARK WHICH MIGHT
THAT SHE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SATISFIED WITH THE CONSUMMATION FOR THE HEROINE HAD AFTER MUCH SORROW AND PATIENT ENDURANCE AT LENGTH MARRIED A MAN WHOM SHE COULD NOT HELP KNOWING
LIGHTED HIS CIGAR ALL ROUND ITS EXTREME PERIPHERY TOOK IT FROM HIS MOUTH REGARDED ITS GLOWING END WITH A SMILE OF SATISFACTION AND BURST INTO A LAUGH IT WAS NOT A SCORNFUL LAUGH
AND HAS NO BUSINESS IN ANY PULPIT BUT OUGHT TO BETAKE HIMSELF TO SOME OTHER EMPLOYMENT WHATEVER HE MAY HAVE BEEN PREDESTINED TO I MEAN MADE FIT FOR
BUT TO QUIET CONTENTMENT WHICH WHATEVER ITS IMMEDIATE SHAPE TO BE CONTENTMENT AT ALL MUST BE THE WILL OF GOD LAY BEYOND ALAS THAT MEN CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS SUCH A THING AS
YOUR COUNTER IS OR OUGHT TO BE HIS ALTAR AND EVERYTHING THEREON LAID WITH INTENT OF DOING AS WELL AS YOU CAN FOR YOUR NEIGHBOUR IN THE NAME OF THE MAN CHRIST JESUS IS A TRUE SACRIFICE OFFERED TO HIM
RUTHLESS TYRANT IF THE BLOOD OF ABEL CALLED FOR VENGEANCE ON HIS MURDERER WHAT MUST BE THE VIALS OF WRATH WHICH ARE RESERVED FOR THEE A FLUSH OVERSPREAD THE FACE OF DE WARENNE AT THIS APOSTROPHE AND FORCING A SMILE
A COUNCIL BEING HELD RESPECTING THE DISPOSAL OF THE NEW TROOPS IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE LENNOX MEN MUST REMAIN WITH THEIR EARL IN GARRISON WHILE THOSE BROUGHT BY MAXWELL AND UNDER HIS COMMAND SHOULD FOLLOW WALLACE IN THE PROSECUTION OF HIS CONQUESTS ALONG WITH HIS OWN ESPECIAL PEOPLE
PROCLAIMED ITSELF THE RECEPTACLE OF THOSE CATARACTS WHICH RUSH TREMENDOUS FROM THE EVER STREAMING PENTLAND HILLS SOULIS DISMOUNTED THE MEN SET DOWN THE LITTER AND REMOVED TO A DISTANCE AS HE APPROACHED
HELEN LOVED THE RESOLUTION OF HER COUSIN AND BELIEVING THAT THE NOW RAVAGED ELLERSLIE HAD NO ATTRACTIONS TO HOLD MARAUDERS AMONGST ITS RUINS SHE DISMISSED LORD ANDREW TO MAKE HIS PREPARATIONS AND TURNED HERSELF TO PREFER HER SUIT ACCORDINGLY TO HER FATHER
BUT HE WILL BE OUR REGENT THAT HE MAY BE OUR DICTATOR AND EVERY DAY DEMAND GRATITUDE FOR VOLUNTARY SERVICES WHICH PERFORMED AS A KING COULD ONLY BE CONSIDERED AS HIS DUTY WHEN THE COUNCIL BROKE UP
BUT FROM WHAT POINT I CANNOT GUESS MY DAUGHTER HAS BRAVED A DARK AND LONELY WALK FROM SNAWDOUN TO BRING THE PROOFS WHILE SPEAKING
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEM TILL NOW YOU NEVER DISAPPROVED THEM I ALLOWED THEM IN YOUR INFANCY REPLIED THE COUNTESS BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WENT NO FURTHER THAN A MINSTREL'S SONG
BUT TO OPEN HIS CASTLE GATES TO THE ENEMY AND TO REPEL HIM BEFORE HE REACHES OURS MY BRAVE CHIEFS REPLIED WALLACE I HAVE SUMMONED YOU EDWARD
TO OBSERVE THE OVERWHELMING GUSTS OF THE TEMPEST AND THEN JUDGE WHETHER THEY DARE VENTURE WITH THE LITTER ON SO DANGEROUS A PATHWAY MADE SLIPPERY BY DESCENDING RAIN TO HALT IN SUCH A SPOT SEEMED TO SOULIS AS UNSAFE AS TO PROCEED
AND HAD MADE HIM FEEL ITS FALSENESS HE FOUND HIMSELF FORCED AT TIMES OUT OF THE CIVILITY DUE TO HER SEX TO COMPLY WITH HER INVITATIONS INDEED
AND AS HE COMMUNICATED HIS EXULTATION AND HAPPINESS SHE REJOICED IN THE BENEDICTIONS WHICH HIS GRATEFUL SPIRIT INVOKED ON THE HEAD OF HER ALMOST WORSHIPED SOVEREIGN HER HEART GAVE HIM HIS TITLE
SCOTLAND WILL DISCHARGE ITSELF UPON THE VALLEYS OF ENGLAND AND THERE COMPEL THEM TO SHARE THE FATE IN WHICH WE MAY BE DOOMED TO PERISH I WILL THINK OF THIS DISCOURSE RETURNED MONTGOMERY WHEN I AM FAR DISTANT AND RELY ON IT NOBLE WALLACE THAT I WILL ASSERT THE PRIVILEGE OF MY BIRTH
BY THE SWORD MY ANCESTORS GAINED THEIR ESTATES AND WITH THE SWORD I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO EXTEND MY TERRITORIES
KEPT THEM STILL INFLAMED AND THEIR SMART MADE HIS VENGEANCE BURN THE FIERCER AGAINST WALLACE WHO HE NOW LEARNED WAS THE MYSTERIOUS AGENT OF HER RESCUE
HE WAS TRYING HIS ELOQUENCE AMONG THE CLAN AT LENNOX WHEN KER ARRIVING STAMPED HIS PERSUASIONS WITH TRUTH AND ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED MEN ARRANGED THEMSELVES UNDER THEIR LORD'S STANDARD MAXWELL GLADLY EXPLAINED HIMSELF TO WALLACE'S LIEUTENANT
AFTER IT ARRIVES THE ARMY OF OUR LIEGE LORD IS NOW IN THE LOTHIANS PASSING THROUGH THEM UNDER THE APPELLATION OF SUCCORS FOR THE REGENT FROM THE HEBRIDES KEEP ALL SAFE
LET US BE FAITHFUL TO OURSELVES MY VETERAN FRIEND AND ALL WILL GO WELL IT MATTERS NOT WHO THE OTHER TRAITORS ARE THEY MUST SOON DISCOVER THEMSELVES AND SHALL FIND US PREPARED TO COUNTERACT THEIR MACHINATIONS
EVEN TO NIGHT THIS INSTANT AND GO OUT AND BRING IN YOUR FOLLOWERS I WILL CALL UP MINE FROM THE BANKS OF THE CLYDE AND BE READY TO MEET HIM ERE HE CROSSES THE CARROU
AND THE TEARS WHICH NOW FLOWED FROM THE EYES OF HELEN AS THEY MINGLED WITH HER PIOUS ASPIRATIONS SEEMED THE BALM OF PARADISE DESCENDING UPON HER SOUL WHEN ALL WAS OVER THE VENERABLE HALBERT WHO HAD CONCEALED HIS OVERWHELMING SORROW BEHIND A PILLAR
AND HALBERT WITH A FULL HEART TOOK THE PENNON IN HIS HAND AH LITTLE DID MY DEAR LADY THINK EXCLAIMED HE THAT ONE OF THESE LOVED LOCKS WOULD EVER BE SUSPENDED ON A STAFF TO LEAD MEN TO BATTLE WHAT CHANGES HAVE A FEW DAYS MADE
AND FOR FEAR OF PRECIPITATING HIM INTO THE NEW DANGERS WHICH MIGHT HAVE MENACED HIM HAD HE SOUGHT TO BRING AWAY HER BODY I DID NOT DISPROVE HIS MISTAKE BUT HER BODY SHALL BE BROUGHT AWAY REJOINED LADY HELEN IT SHALL HAVE HOLY BURIAL
BY THE DOLEFUL LAMENT OF THE TROOP RETURNING FROM ELLERSLIE SHE DROPPED THE HALF FORMED SCARF FROM HER HAND AND LISTENED WITHOUT DARING TO DRAW HER BREATH TO THE DEEP TONED LAMENTATIONS
WELL AWARE THAT IF THEY COULD REGAIN HER THEIR MASTER WOULD BE SATISFIED BUT ON THE REVERSE SHOULD SHE BE LOST THE WHOLE TROOP KNEW THEIR FATE WOULD BE SOME MERCILESS PUNISHMENT MACGREGOR AND THE DESERTER OF CRESSINGHAM
WHICH WOULD MAKE ME REVERE ITS POSSESSOR WERE HE THE LOWLIEST MAN IN YOUR LEGIONS ALLOW ME NOBLEST OF SCOTS TO PLEAD ONE WORD IN VINDICATION OF HIM TO WHOM MY ALLEGIANCE IS PLEDGED HAD HE COME HITHER CONDUCTED BY WAR ALONE WHAT WOULD EDWARD HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN ANY OTHER CONQUEROR
AND WHAT O FOOLISH HELEN
WHAT GREAT SERVICE WILL HE HAVE DONE TO ME OR TO YOUR FATHER IF HE DELIVER HIM FROM ONE DANGER ONLY TO PLUNGE HIM INTO ANOTHER EDWARD'S POWER IN THIS COUNTRY IS TOO GREAT TO BE RESISTED NOW HAVE NOT MOST OF OUR BARONS SWORN FEALTY TO HIM
HE NOW TOLD HER THAT THE BODY OF THE DECEASED LADY WAS DEPOSITED IN THE CHAPEL OF THE CASTLE AND THAT THE PRIESTS FROM THE ADJACENT PRIORY ONLY AWAITED HER PRESENCE TO CONSIGN IT WITH THE CHURCH'S RITES TO ITS TOMB
AND TO THE SWEET CONTAGION OF HER TASTE DO I OWE THAT LOVE OF TRUE GLORY WHICH CARRIES ME TO THE SIDE OF SIR WILLIAM WALLACE THE VIRTUOUS ONLY CAN AWAKEN ANY INTEREST IN HER HEART
WHO IS IT THAT DARES THUS INVADE THY DUTIES BUT MY GRATITUDE GRATITUDE TO THE ONCE LOVED LORD WILL NOT OFFEND THY PURE SPIRIT
HE TRAVERSED THE ADJOINING COUNTRY STRIVING TO ENLIGHTEN THE UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE STUPIDLY SATISFIED AND TO EXCITE THE DISCONTENTED TO REVOLT WITH MOST HE FAILED
HAS NO CHANCE OF GIVING YOU THE OFFENSE THAT I DO AND I AM FORCED TO OFFEND YOU BECAUSE I CANNOT DISOBEY MY CONSCIENCE A TEAR STOOD IN THE EYE OF LADY HELEN CANNOT YOU DEAR LADY MAR CONTINUED SHE FORCING A SMILE
THOUGHT OF NO ENEMY TO THE TRANQUIL FULFILLMENT OF HIS DUTIES BUT THE MINOR PERSECUTIONS OF LADY MAR
MAY I HAVE WHAT I PLEASE FROM THE BOTHWELL ARMORY COMMAND EVEN THERE SAID THE EARL YOUR UNCLE BOTHWELL IS TOO TRUE A SCOT TO GRUDGE A SWORD IN SO PIOUS A CAUSE HELEN THREW HER ARMS ABOUT HER FATHER'S NECK THANKING HIM TENDERLY
AND REMEMBERING THE THREATS WHICH HAD ESCAPED THAT LADY IN THEIR LAST CONVERSATION SHE SAW NO REASON TO DOUBT WHAT SO CLEARLY EXPLAINED THE BEFORE INEXPLICABLE SEIZURE OF HER FATHER THE BETRAYING OF WALLACE AND HER OWN PRESENT CALAMITY
OUR MOUNTAINS ARE HIS SEAL PLAINS ARE THE PROPER TERRITORIES OF TYRANNY THERE THE ARMIES OF A USURPER MAY EXTEND THEMSELVES WITH EASE LEAVING NO CORNER UNOCCUPIED IN WHICH PATRIOTISM MIGHT SHELTER OR TREASON HIDE
TREASON
AND REMEMBER THAT GOD NOT ONLY ARMETH THE PATRIOT'S HAND BUT SHIELDETH HIS HEART IN THIS FAITH BE YE THE BUCKLERS WHICH HEAVEN SENDS TO GUARD THE LIFE OF WALLACE AND SO HONORED EXULT IN YOUR STATION AND EXPECT THE FUTURE GRATITUDE OF SCOTLAND
LANDS IN MAR SHALL BE YOURS ADDED SHE OR A POST OF HONOR IN THE LITTLE ARMY THE EARL IS NOW GOING TO RAISE SPEAK BUT THE WORD AND YOU SHALL FIND WORTHY ENGLISHMAN THAT NEITHER A SCOTSMAN NOR HIS DAUGHTER KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE UNGRATEFUL
THE FIRMNESS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE AND THE DETERMINED EXPRESSION OF HIS NOBLE COUNTENANCE CONVINCED LOCH AWE THAT HE WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN AND RISING FROM HIS KNEE HE BOWED IN SILENCE MARCH
CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE PENTLAND HILLS HELEN LISTENED WITH ASTONISHMENT AND GRIEF TO THIS TOO PROBABLE STORY OF HER STEP MOTHER'S ILL JUDGED TENDERNESS OR CRUEL TREACHERY
SHE RAISED HER HEAD SHE FELT
AND A FEW BRAVE SPIRITS WHO WOULD PUT ALL TO THE HAZARD FOR SO GOOD A CAUSE COULD BE PREVAILED ON TO HOLD THEMSELVES IN READINESS TO OBEY SIR EUSTACE WHEN HE SHOULD SEE THE MOMENT TO CONDUCT THEM TO SIR WILLIAM WALLACE
SO THAT THE COMPARISON IS LUMINOUS IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE I DO NOT THINK THAT IN THE SPECIAL SCHEME WHICH THE NOVELIST SET HIMSELF HERE HE CAN BE ACCUSED OF ANY FAILURE THE LIFE IS AS VIVID AS EVER
BUT COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY AS NONE OF HIS OFFICERS WERE THEN IN ENGLAND IN THE MEAN TIME HE WAS ONE DAY APPREHENDED AND COMMITTED HITHER ON SUSPICION OF STEALING THREE HERRINGS FROM A FISHMONGER HE WAS TRIED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO FOR THIS OFFENCE AND ACQUITTED INDEED
HE REMINDS US THAT HIS AUTHOR HAD HAD A LONG THEATRICAL APPRENTICESHIP HE IS SOMETHING TOO MUCH D'UNE PIECE BUT AS A STUDY OF THE BRAVE MAN WHO IS ALMOST MORE BRAGGART THAN BRAVE
TO PUT WHAT I MEAN OUT OF REACH OF CAVIL COMPARE IMOGEN AND AMELIA AND THE DIFFERENCE WILL BE FELT BUT FIELDING WAS A PROSE WRITER WRITING IN LONDON IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WHILE SHAKESPEARE WAS A POET WRITING IN ALL TIME AND ALL SPACE
AND HAVING DREST HERSELF IN THE UTMOST HURRY LEFT HER CHILDREN TO THE CARE OF HER HUSBAND AND RAN AWAY TO PAY HER RESPECTS TO HER FRIEND WHOM SHE LOVED WITH A MOST SINCERE AFFECTION BUT HOW WAS SHE DISAPPOINTED
THE FIRST PERSONS WHOM THEY PASSED BY WERE THREE MEN IN FETTERS WHO WERE ENJOYING THEMSELVES VERY MERRILY OVER A BOTTLE OF WINE AND A PIPE OF TOBACCO THESE MISTER ROBINSON INFORMED HIS FRIEND WERE THREE STREET ROBBERS AND WERE ALL CERTAIN OF BEING HANGED THE ENSUING SESSIONS
AFTER THIS SECOND VENT OF SORROW OR SHAME OR IF THE READER PLEASES OF RAGE SHE ONCE MORE RECOVERED FROM HER AGONIES TO SAY THE TRUTH THESE ARE I BELIEVE AS CRITICAL DISCHARGES OF NATURE
CHAPTER FIVE CONTAINING CERTAIN ADVENTURES WHICH BEFEL MISTER BOOTH IN THE PRISON THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY MISTER BOOTH SPENT IN MELANCHOLY CONTEMPLATION ON HIS PRESENT CONDITION
IT IS POSSIBLE SOME READERS MAY BE NO LESS SURPRIZED AT THE BEHAVIOUR OF MISSUS JAMES THAN WAS AMELIA HERSELF SINCE THEY MAY HAVE PERHAPS RECEIVED SO FAVOURABLE AN IMPRESSION OF THAT LADY FROM THE ACCOUNT GIVEN OF HER BY MISTER BOOTH
WHEN THAT HAPPY DAY CAME IN WHICH UNHALLOWED HANDS ARE FORBIDDEN TO CONTAMINATE THE SHOULDERS OF THE UNFORTUNATE BOOTH WENT EARLY TO THE COLONEL'S HOUSE AND BEING ADMITTED TO HIS PRESENCE BEGAN WITH GREAT FREEDOM
THAT HER PRESENT DEMEANOUR MAY SEEM UNNATURAL AND INCONSISTENT WITH HER FORMER CHARACTER BUT THEY WILL BE PLEASED TO CONSIDER THE GREAT ALTERATION IN HER CIRCUMSTANCES
FOR WHICH SHE EXPRESSED GREAT CONCERN SHE HAD SENT HIM THAT GUINEA WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED THE DAY BEFORE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO EXCUSE HERSELF FOR NOT HAVING DESIRED TO SEE HIM AT THAT TIME
CHAPTER TEN TABLE TALK CONSISTING OF A FACETIOUS DISCOURSE THAT PASSED IN THE PRISON THERE WERE ASSEMBLED AT THE TABLE THE GOVERNOR OF THESE NOT IMPROPERLY CALLED INFERNAL REGIONS THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR VULGARLY NAMED THE FIRST TURNKEY
WHO HATH HAPPENED FORTUNATELY I MIGHT ALMOST SAY UNFORTUNATELY TO HAVE FOUR BY HONOURS IN HIS HAND ALMOST EVERY TIME HE DEALT FOR A WHOLE EVENING SHUNNED UNIVERSALLY BY THE WHOLE COMPANY THE NEXT DAY
QUITE ESTIMABLE AND HARMLESS BUT EVEN AS IT IS THEY ARE NOT TO BE WHOLLY ILL SPOKEN OF BEING WHAT THEY ARE FIELDING HAS TAKEN THEM AND WITH A RELENTLESSNESS WHICH SWIFT COULD HARDLY HAVE EXCEEDED AND A GOOD NATURE WHICH SWIFT RARELY OR NEVER ATTAINED
ONE OF THESE SAID SHE HOPED MISS WOULD NOT HOLD HER HEAD SO HIGH FOR THE FUTURE ANOTHER ANSWERED I DO NOT KNOW MADAM WHAT SHE MAY DO WITH HER HEAD BUT I AM CONVINCED SHE WILL NEVER MORE TURN UP HER NOSE AT HER BETTERS ANOTHER CRIED
HAS HELD THEM UP TO US AS DISSECTED PREPARATIONS OF HALF INNOCENT MEANNESS SCOUNDRELISM AND VANITY SUCH AS ARE HARDLY ANYWHERE ELSE TO BE FOUND I HAVE USED THE WORD PREPARATIONS AND IT IN PART INDICATES FIELDING'S VIRTUE
OR AT LEAST FAILURE IN SYMPATHY PRONOUNCES IT ON THE WHOLE UNPLEASING AND REGARDS IT CHIEFLY AS A SEQUEL TO TOM JONES SHOWING WHAT IS TO BE EXPECTED OF A LIBERTINE AND THOUGHTLESS HUSBAND BUT HE TOO IS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THE HEROINE THACKERAY
I HAVE NOT THEIR USUAL DESIGN IN THIS EPISTLE NOR WILL I BORROW THEIR LANGUAGE LONG VERY LONG MAY IT BE BEFORE A MOST DREADFUL CIRCUMSTANCE SHALL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR ANY PEN TO DRAW A JUST AND TRUE CHARACTER OF YOURSELF WITHOUT INCURRING A SUSPICION OF FLATTERY IN THE BOSOMS OF THE MALIGNANT
AND IN THAT ONE THERE IS THE EIGHTEEN PENCE I TOLD YOU OF HE THEN TURNED UP HIS CLOATHS AND HIS POCKETS ENTIRELY RESEMBLED THE PITCHERS OF THE BELIDES BOOTH WAS A LITTLE STAGGERED AT THIS DEFENCE
IT IS PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE EASY TO FIND FAULT WITH ITS CHARACTERS THAN WITH THEIRS
A PENNY LOAF WHICH IS IT SEEMS THE ORDINARY ALLOWANCE TO THE PRISONERS IN BRIDEWELL WAS NOW DELIVERED HIM AND WHILE HE WAS EATING THIS A MAN BROUGHT HIM A LITTLE PACKET SEALED UP
IT WOULD BE INVIDIOUS AND IS NOWAYS NEEDFUL
AND PUT AN END TO ANY FURTHER DISPUTE SOON AFTER WHICH THE COMPANY BROKE UP AND NONE BUT HIMSELF MISTER MURPHY CAPTAIN BOOTH AND MISS MATTHEWS REMAINED TOGETHER
I SCORN TO RAP FOOTNOTE A CANT WORD MEANING TO SWEAR OR RATHER TO PERJURE YOURSELF AGAINST ANY LADY D N ME MADAM CRIED ANOTHER FEMALE I HONOUR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE I ONCE PUT A KNIFE INTO A CULL MYSELF
THOUGH THE TOUCH OF SENSIBILITY IS ON HIM IS EXCELLENT AND DOCTOR HARRISON'S COUNTRY FRIEND AND HIS PRIG OF A SON ARE CAPITAL AND BONDUM AND THE AUTHOR AND ROBINSON AND ALL THE MINOR CHARACTERS ARE AS GOOD AS THEY CAN BE
THE KEEPER NO SOONER VIEWED THE PURSE THAN HIS FEATURES BECAME ALL SOFTENED IN AN INSTANT AND WITH ALL THE COURTESY OF WHICH HE WAS MASTER HE DESIRED THE LADY TO WALK WITH HIM ASSURING HER THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE THE BEST APARTMENT IN HIS HOUSE MISTER BOOTH WAS NOW LEFT ALONE
AND SO FOOLISHLY DID I IMAGINE I COULD BE MASTER OF A FLAME TO WHICH I WAS EVERY DAY ADDING FUEL O MISS MATTHEWS WE HAVE HEARD OF MEN ENTIRELY MASTERS OF THEIR PASSIONS AND OF HEARTS WHICH CAN CARRY THIS FIRE IN THEM AND CONCEAL IT AT THEIR PLEASURE
NO INDEED SIR ANSWERED BOOTH I KNOW NOTHING OF THE LAW THEN SIR I WILL TELL YOU
THAT I SHOULD EVER HAVE BEEN FOUND IN NOR CAN YOU KNOW THE CAUSE OF ALL THAT I HAVE UTTERED AND WHICH I AM CONVINCED YOU NEVER EXPECTED TO HAVE HEARD FROM MY MOUTH IF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES RAISE YOUR CURIOSITY
I HOPE THE LADY SAID ROBINSON HATH NO SUSPICION OF ANY PERSON HERE I HOPE WE ARE ALL PERSONS OF HONOUR AT THIS TABLE D N MY EYES ANSWERED A WELL DRESSED WOMAN I CAN ANSWER FOR MYSELF AND THE OTHER LADIES
AS SHE PAST BY MISTER BOOTH SHE DAMNED HIS EYES AND DISCHARGED A VOLLEY OF WORDS EVERY ONE OF WHICH WAS TOO INDECENT TO BE REPEATED THEY NOW BEHELD A LITTLE CREATURE SITTING BY HERSELF IN A CORNER AND CRYING BITTERLY THIS GIRL MISTER ROBINSON SAID
PREVENTED MY ASPIRING AT THE POSSESSION OF THOSE CHARMS WHICH SEEMED SO ABSOLUTELY OUT OF MY REACH HOWEVER IT WAS I ASSURE YOU THE ACCIDENT WHICH DEPRIVED HER OF THE ADMIRATION OF OTHERS MADE THE FIRST GREAT IMPRESSION ON MY HEART IN HER FAVOUR
I WILL SATISFY IT HE ANSWERED THAT CURIOSITY WAS TOO MEAN A WORD TO EXPRESS HIS ARDENT DESIRE OF KNOWING HER STORY UPON WHICH WITH VERY LITTLE PREVIOUS CEREMONY
SHE SAID I HAD MADE A VERY ILL CHOICE OF A COUNSELLOR IN A MATTER IN WHICH SHE WAS SO IGNORANT ADDING AT LAST I BELIEVE MISTER BOOTH YOU GENTLEMEN WANT VERY LITTLE ADVICE IN THESE AFFAIRS WHICH YOU ALL UNDERSTAND BETTER THAN WE DO
I WAS HURT WITH PERCEIVING SO MUCH MALICE IN HUMAN SHAPE AND CRIED OUT VERY BLUNTLY INDEED LADIES YOU NEED NOT EXPRESS SUCH SATISFACTION AT POOR MISS EMILY'S ACCIDENT FOR SHE WILL STILL BE THE HANDSOMEST WOMAN IN ENGLAND
BEGAN TO OPEN HER CASE TO MISTER MURPHY WHOM SHE ADMITTED TO BE HER SOLICITOR THOUGH SHE STILL DECLARED SHE WAS INDIFFERENT AS TO THE EVENT OF THE TRIAL MISTER MURPHY HAVING HEARD ALL THE PARTICULARS WITH WHICH THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED AS FAR AS RELATED TO THE MURDER SHOOK HIS HEAD AND SAID
WHICH YOU DID NOT PERHAPS KNOW TOLD YOU TO MY DISADVANTAGE AND IF YOU THOUGHT ME TO BE A GAMBLER YOU HAD JUST REASON TO SUSPECT ANY ILL OF ME FOR I MYSELF AM CONFINED HERE BY THE PERJURY OF ONE OF THOSE VILLAINS
THE FIRST THING AFTER REDEMPTION OF THE COAT WHICH MISTER BOOTH HUNGRY AS HE WAS THOUGHT OF WAS TO SUPPLY HIMSELF WITH SNUFF WHICH HE HAD LONG TO HIS GREAT SORROW BEEN WITHOUT ON THIS OCCASION HE PRESENTLY MISSED THAT IRON BOX
IF WE DISCARD THIS FALLACY BOLDLY AND ASK OURSELVES WHETHER AMELIA IS OR IS NOT AS GOOD AS JOSEPH ANDREWS OR TOM JONES WE SHALL I THINK BE INCLINED TO ANSWER RATHER IN THE AFFIRMATIVE THAN IN THE NEGATIVE
COME COME MADAM CRIES MURPHY LIFE IS SWEET LET ME TELL YOU AND NEVER SWEETER THAN WHEN WE ARE NEAR LOSING IT
WHAT DO YOU HEAR REITERATED SHE YOU HEAR THE RESENTMENT OF THE MOST INJURED OF WOMEN YOU HAVE HEARD YOU SAY OF THE MURDER BUT DO YOU KNOW THE CAUSE MISTER BOOTH HAVE YOU SINCE YOUR RETURN TO ENGLAND VISITED THAT COUNTRY
SO THAT A BY STANDER WOULD HAVE DOUBTED IN EVERY OTHER ARTICLE THAN DRESS WHICH OF THE TWO WAS THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED FINE LADY AFTER A VISIT OF TWENTY MINUTES DURING WHICH NOT A WORD OF ANY FORMER OCCURRENCES WAS MENTIONED
AND I MAY BE THE MEANS OF MAKING MANY HAPPY AS WELL AS MYSELF BY PLACING A GENEROUS CONFIDENCE IN HIM AND THEN I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE SENT TO COLBRAND OR TO ROBIN TO CARRY ME BACK WHETHER I WOULD OR NOT AND HOW DIFFERENT IS HIS BEHAVIOUR TO THAT
HE SAYS IN HIS LETTER HE WAS A FRIGHTFUL SPECTACLE HE MIGHT BE SO INDEED WHEN HE FIRST CAME IN A DOORS BUT HE LOOKS WELL ENOUGH NOW AND ONLY FOR A FEW GROANS NOW AND THEN WHEN HE THINKS OF HIS DANGER
I COULD NOT STAND THIS BARBAROUS INSULT AS I TOOK IT TO BE CONSIDERING HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ME AND I THEN SPOKE AND SAID O THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MINDS OF THY CREATURES GOOD GOD HOW SHALL SOME BE CAST DOWN IN THEIR INNOCENCE WHILE OTHERS CAN TRIUMPH IN THEIR GUILT
I THOUGHT HE WAS MAD FOR MY SHARE FOR HE KNEW NOT WHAT HE WOULD HAVE I WAS GOING HOWEVER BUT HE STEPT AFTER ME AND TOOK HOLD OF MY ARM AND BROUGHT ME IN AGAIN
SHOULD I BE NOW DECEIVED I SHOULD BE WORSE OFF THAN EVER BUT I SHALL SEE WHAT LIGHT THIS NEW HONOUR WILL PROCURE ME SO I'LL GET READY BUT I WON'T I THINK CHANGE MY GARB SHOULD I DO IT IT WOULD LOOK AS IF I WOULD BE NEARER ON A LEVEL WITH HIM AND YET SHOULD I NOT IT MIGHT BE THOUGHT A DISGRACE TO HIM
O THIS WICKED WOMAN TO TRICK ME SO EVERY THING MAN WOMAN AND BEAST IS IN A PLOT AGAINST YOUR POOR PAMELA I THINK THEN I KNOW NOT ONE STEP OF THE WAY NOR HOW FAR TO ANY HOUSE OR COTTAGE
AND I SHOULD HAVE DESERVED EVERY BODY'S CENSURE AS THE BASEST OF CREATURES HAD I BEEN CAPABLE OF CONTRIBUTING TO YOUR LAWLESS ATTEMPTS
FOR I LOVE YOU AND ALL THE HOUSE AND VALUE HIM IF HE WOULD ACT AS MY MASTER WELL THEN AS I KNOW HIS DESIGNS AND THAT HE OWNS HE CANNOT HELP IT MUST I HAVE ASKED TO STAY KNOWING HE WOULD ATTEMPT ME AGAIN
THAT I SHOULD RETURN TO MY POOR PARENTS I AM NOT SUFFERED TO GO QUIETLY GOOD YOUR HONOUR WHAT HAVE I DONE THAT I MUST BE USED WORSE
THE LATTER HERE IN GREAT FORM GAVE ME BEFORE ROBIN THE LETTER WHICH I HAD GIVEN HIM BACK FOR THAT PURPOSE AND I RETIRED AS IF TO READ IT AND SO I DID FOR I THINK I CAN'T READ IT TOO OFTEN THOUGH FOR MY PEACE OF MIND'S SAKE I MIGHT BETTER TRY TO FORGET IT
AND YOUR MASTER'S HEART TURNED TO SEE THE FOLLY OF HIS WAYS AND THE INJURY HE HAD INTENDED TO OUR DEAR CHILD FOR TO BE SURE MY DEAR HE WOULD HAVE RUINED YOU IF HE COULD BUT SEEING YOUR VIRTUE HIS HEART IS TOUCHED
AND BRING ME TO A TRIAL FOR MY LIFE
YOU SEE WHAT I HAVE SUFFERED BY YOUR FORCING ME IN TO MY MASTER AND A GENTLEWOMAN OF YOUR YEARS AND EXPERIENCE MUST NEEDS KNOW THAT IT WAS NOT FIT FOR ME TO PRETEND TO BE ANY BODY ELSE FOR MY OWN SAKE NOR WITH REGARD TO MY MASTER
AND SO IT WAS BETTER TO BEGIN HERE AS I WAS SOON TO GO AWAY THAT ALL MY FELLOW SERVANTS MIGHT SEE I KNEW HOW TO SUIT MYSELF TO THE STATE I WAS RETURNING TO WELL SAID SHE I NEVER KNEW THE LIKE OF THEE
THERE'S MY GOOD MISSUS JERVIS SAID I
WHAT DOES THE LITTLE FOOL COVER HER FACE FOR SAID HE PULL YOUR APRON AWAY AND LET ME SEE HOW YOU LOOK AFTER YOUR FREEDOM OF SPEECH OF ME LAST NIGHT NO WONDER YOU ARE ASHAMED TO SEE ME YOU KNOW YOU WERE VERY FREE WITH MY CHARACTER
AND KNOW NOT HOW I GOT HOME I WILL WRITE A LETTER OF THANKS THIS NIGHT IF I AM ABLE TO MY KIND PATRON FOR HIS INESTIMABLE GOODNESS TO ME I WISH I WAS ENABLED TO SAY ALL I HOPE
SAID SHE AND KINDLY THREW HERSELF UPON MY COAT CLASPING ME ROUND THE WAIST
IT LOOKED PROMISING SHE SAID I HEEDED NOT HER REFLECTIONS
IF IT BE I WILL LOSE NO TIME TO PROVIDE A HORSE FOR YOU AND ANOTHER FOR MYSELF FOR I CAN NEVER DO EITHER GOD OR MYSELF BETTER SERVICE THOUGH I WERE TO FOREGO ALL MY EXPECTATIONS FOR IT HERE I AM
AND LESSEN THE REGARD HE USED TO HAVE IN THE EYES OF ALL HIS SERVANTS ON MY ACCOUNT BUT I AM TO TELL YOU OF MY NEW DRESS TO DAY AND SO WHEN I HAD DINED UP STAIRS I WENT AND LOCKED MYSELF INTO MY LITTLE ROOM
WHICH HAS ENABLED THEE TO WITHSTAND SO MANY TEMPTATIONS WE HAVE NOT YET HAD LEISURE TO READ THROUGH YOUR LONG ACCOUNTS OF ALL YOUR HARDSHIPS I SAY LONG BECAUSE I WONDER HOW YOU COULD FIND TIME AND OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM
BUT THE DIVINE GRACE IS NOT CONFINED TO SPACE AND REMORSE MAY AND I HOPE HAS SMITTEN HIM TO THE HEART AT ONCE FOR HIS INJURIES TO POOR ME YET I WON'T BE TOO SECURE NEITHER
AND I AM PERSUADED THAT FEAR BRINGS ONE INTO MORE DANGERS THAN THE CAUTION THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT DELIVERS ONE FROM I THEN LOCKED THE DOOR AND PUT THE KEY IN MY POCKET AND WAS IN A SAD QUANDARY
NO FORTUNE TO OUR DEAR CHILD BUT RATHER MUST BE A DISGRACE TO HER AS THE WORLD WILL THINK YET I HOPE I DO NOT SIN IN MY PRIDE TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO GOOD MAN OF A COMMON DEGREE
MEAN TIME SHE HUMBLE HERSELF AND ASK THIS AS A FAVOUR AND IS SORRY FOR HER PERTNESS AND THE LIBERTY SHE HAS TAKEN WITH MY CHARACTER OUT OF THE HOUSE AND IN THE HOUSE YOUR HONOUR INDEED TOLD ME SO SAID MISSUS JERVIS
NO NEED OF IT SAID I FOR I DON'T INTEND TO HAVE MISTER WILLIAMS WHAT THEN IS THAT LETTER TO ME WELL SAID SHE I SEE THOU ART QUITE UNFATHOMABLE I DON'T LIKE ALL THIS
BEING A CUNNING ARTFUL WOMAN I KNOW NOT WHAT TO MAKE OF IT I HAVE REFUSED HER ABSOLUTELY URGING THAT EXCEPT I INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE HIS SUIT I OUGHT NOT TO DO IT AND SHE IS GONE WITHOUT ME I HAVE
I AM ALMOST DISTRACTED AT FIRST I WAS AFRAID OF MISSUS JERVIS BUT I AM FULLY SATISFIED SHE IS VERY GOOD AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOST BUT FOR HER AND SHE TAKES ON GRIEVOUSLY ABOUT IT
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE MISSUS JEWKES SAID HE HAD A FEVERISH COMPLAINT AND HAD BEEN BLOODED AND VERY PRUDENTLY ORDERED ABRAHAM WHEN HE AWAKED NOT TO TELL HIM I WAS COME FOR FEAR OF SURPRISING HIM AND AUGMENTING HIS FEVER
BUT SIR SAID I I SHALL DISGRACE YOU TO GO THUS
AND RETIRED TO MY CLOSET TO WRITE A LETTER FOR THE TILES
THOUGH MISSUS JEWKES IS SOMETIMES A LITTLE HARD UPON ME YET I KNOW NOT WHERE I AM WITHOUT HER I GO UP AND I COME DOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN THE GARDEN AND NOT HAVING HER KNOW SCARCELY WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF AY SAID THE IDEOT
HOWEVER SAID SHE ALL IS WELL NOW BECAUSE MY WATCHMENTS ARE NOW OVER BY MY MASTER'S DIRECTION HOW HAVE YOU EMPLOYED YOURSELF IN MY ABSENCE I WAS SO TROUBLED AT WHAT MIGHT HAVE PASSED BETWEEN MISTER WILLIAMS AND HER
I LITTLE SUSPECTED IT THOUGH I USED TILL THIS SAD NIGHT ALWAYS TO LOOK INTO THAT CLOSET AND ANOTHER IN THE ROOM AND UNDER THE BED EVER SINCE THE SUMMER HOUSE TRICK BUT NEVER FOUND ANY THING AND SO I DID NOT DO IT THEN BEING FULLY RESOLVED TO BE ANGRY WITH MISSUS JERVIS
TO MAKE HER HAPPY IN SOME HONEST FELLOW OF HER OWN DEGREE AND THAT WILL BE DOING SOMETHING AND WILL ALSO OBLIGE AND PACIFY YOUR MUCH GRIEVED SISTER IF I HAVE WRITTEN TOO SHARPLY CONSIDER IT IS MY LOVE TO YOU AND THE SHAME YOU ARE BRINGING UPON YOURSELF
NOW I WAS QUITE IGNORANT OF HIS MEANING THOUGH I DID NOT LIKE IT WHEN IT WAS AFTERWARDS EXPLAINED NEITHER AND WELL THOUGHT I WHAT WILL THIS COME TO AT LAST IF POOR PAMELA IS ESTEEMED A THIEF
AND YOU CAN PRAY FOR HER WITH HEARTS SO SINCERE AND PURE THAT ARE NOT TO BE MET WITH IN PALACES OH
NOR INDEED TO SAY ANY THING OF ME TILL SHE HERSELF BROKE IT TO HIM IN THE MORNING AS SHE SHOULD SEE HOW HE WAS
SHE GAVE NO HINTS OF THE KEY AND THE DOOR ET CETERA
YOU SHALL BE UNDER NO RESTRAINT AS YOU WILL SEE BY MY LETTER ENCLOSED TO COLBRAND WHICH I HAVE NOT SEALED THAT YOU MAY READ IT BUT SPARE ME MY DEAREST GIRL THE CONFUSION OF FOLLOWING YOU TO YOUR FATHER'S WHICH I MUST DO IF YOU PERSIST TO GO ON FOR I FIND I CANNOT LIVE A DAY WITHOUT YOU
SO MISSUS JEWKES IS RETURNED FROM HER VISIT WELL SAID SHE I WOULD HAVE YOU SET YOUR HEART AT REST FOR MISTER WILLIAMS WILL DO VERY WELL AGAIN HE IS NOT HALF SO BAD AS HE FANCIED O THESE SCHOLARS SAID SHE
O SIR SAID I I AM PAMELA INDEED I AM INDEED I AM PAMELA HER OWN SELF HE KISSED ME FOR ALL I COULD DO AND SAID IMPOSSIBLE YOU ARE A LOVELIER GIRL BY HALF THAN PAMELA
DEAREST MADAM I AM UTTERLY CONFOUNDED AND MUST PLEAD GUILTY TO ALL YOUR JUST REPROACHES I WISH I WERE MASTER OF ALL BUT HALF YOUR CAUTION AND DISCRETION I HOPE AFTER ALL
SURELY THESE PROUD PEOPLE NEVER THINK WHAT A SHORT STAGE LIFE IS AND THAT WITH ALL THEIR VANITY A TIME IS COMING WHEN THEY SHALL BE OBLIGED TO SUBMIT TO BE ON A LEVEL WITH US AND TRUE SAID THE PHILOSOPHER WHEN HE LOOKED UPON THE SKULL OF A KING AND THAT OF A POOR MAN
ACCORDINGLY BOTH MOTHER AND SON SAT DOWN AND ATE WITH THE BETTER RELISH AS THE TABLE WAS SO WELL FURNISHED
BEING VERY FAITHFULLY SECONDED BY THEIR MEN THEY SECURED ALL THE REST THAT WERE UPON THE MAIN AND QUARTER DECKS AND BEGAN TO FASTEN THE HATCHES TO KEEP THEM DOWN THAT WERE BELOW WHEN THE OTHER BOAT AND THEIR MEN ENTERING AT THE FORECHAINS
BUT WITH MUCH SEARCH I FOUND THEM TWO OF THEM DRY AND GOOD THE THIRD HAD TAKEN WATER THOSE TWO I GOT TO MY RAFT WITH THE ARMS
AND HERE I FOUND A FRESH RENEWING OF MY GRIEF
I RESOLVED TO SET ALL OTHER THINGS APART
CARRIED SIX GUNS AND FOURTEEN MEN BESIDES THE MASTER HIS BOY AND MYSELF WE HAD ON BOARD NO LARGE CARGO OF GOODS EXCEPT OF SUCH TOYS AS WERE FIT FOR OUR TRADE WITH THE NEGROES SUCH AS BEADS BITS OF GLASS SHELLS AND OTHER TRIFLES
AND SAW SOME HOUSES WHICH WE APPROACHED
THEY PRESENTED ME TO THEIR KING WHO WAS A GOOD PRINCE
ALADDIN WAS JUST READY TO GO WHEN THE MAGICIAN KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND CAME IN LOADED WITH WINE AND ALL SORTS OF FRUITS WHICH HE BROUGHT FOR A DESSERT AFTER HE HAD GIVEN WHAT HE BROUGHT INTO ALADDIN'S HANDS
BUT WHEN THE ROBBER AND HIS CAPTAIN CAME TO THE STREET THEY FOUND THE SAME DIFFICULTY AT WHICH THE CAPTAIN WAS ENRAGED AND THE ROBBER IN AS GREAT CONFUSION AS HIS PREDECESSOR
HE WANTED SOMETHING TO EAT AND WISHED SHE WOULD GIVE HIM HIS BREAKFAST ALAS CHILD SAID SHE I HAVE NOT A BIT OF BREAD TO GIVE YOU YOU ATE UP ALL THE PROVISIONS I HAD IN THE HOUSE YESTERDAY
LAYING MY TWO PISTOLS JUST AT MY HEAD AND MY GUN AT LENGTH BY ME I WENT TO BED FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SLEPT VERY QUIETLY ALL NIGHT
WE CONCLUDED THERE WAS NO INHABITED COUNTRY FOR US TO HAVE RECOURSE TO TILL WE CAME WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF THE CARIBBEE ISLANDS
KNEW HIM AT FIRST SIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS DISGUISE TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF THE ROBBERS AND EXAMINING HIM VERY CAREFULLY PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD A DAGGER UNDER HIS GARMENT
YET THE SEA WENT DREADFULLY HIGH UPON THE SHORE AND MIGHT BE WELL CALLED
BEING MORE INTENT UPON GETTING AT THE SHIP WHERE I HOPED TO FIND SOMETHING FOR MY PRESENT SUBSISTENCE
AND EMPTIED IT OFTEN UPON THE SOFA TILL SHE HAD DONE WHEN SHE WAS VERY WELL SATISFIED TO FIND THE NUMBER OF MEASURES AMOUNTED TO SO MANY AS THEY DID
SEEING ME TO BE WITHERED LEAN AND SICK DEFERRED MY DEATH MEANWHILE I HAD MUCH LIBERTY SO THAT SCARCELY ANY NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF WHAT I DID
IN WHICH TIME I HAD BROUGHT AWAY ALL THAT ONE PAIR OF HANDS COULD WELL BE SUPPOSED CAPABLE TO BRING THOUGH I BELIEVE VERILY HAD THE CALM WEATHER HELD I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT AWAY THE WHOLE SHIP PIECE BY PIECE BUT PREPARING THE TWELFTH TIME TO GO ON BOARD
TO THESE IN THE MORNING I SENT THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS TO ENTER INTO A PARLEY WITH THEM IN A WORD TO TRY THEM AND TELL ME WHETHER HE THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE TRUSTED OR NOT TO GO ON BOARD AND SURPRISE THE SHIP HE TALKED TO THEM OF THE INJURY DONE HIM
IF THAT IS THE ONLY REASON SAID ALI BABA IT OUGHT NOT TO DEPRIVE ME OF THE HONOR OF YOUR COMPANY FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS NO SALT EVER PUT INTO MY BREAD AND AS TO THE MEAT WE SHALL HAVE TO NIGHT I PROMISE YOU THERE SHALL BE NONE IN THAT
AND TWO SILVER CUPS ALL THESE HE PLACED UPON A CARPET AND DISAPPEARED
BUT I WAS HURRIED ON AND OBEYED BLINDLY THE DICTATES OF MY FANCY RATHER THAN MY REASON AND ACCORDINGLY
WEST FROM CAPE SAINT AUGUSTINO SO THAT HE FOUND HE WAS GOTTEN UPON THE COAST OF GUIANA OR THE NORTH PART OF BRAZIL BEYOND THE RIVER AMAZON TOWARD THAT OF THE RIVER ORINOCO COMMONLY CALLED THE GREAT RIVER AND NOW HE BEGAN TO CONSULT WITH ME
THE NEW CAPTAIN AND HIS MEN FIRED BOLDLY AMONG THEM AND WOUNDED THE MATE WITH A MUSKET BALL WHICH BROKE HIS ARM AND WOUNDED TWO MORE OF THE MEN BUT KILLED NOBODY THE MATE CALLING FOR HELP RUSHED HOWEVER INTO THE ROUND HOUSE
BY KEEPING UP A FRIENDLY CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE FATHER AND SON THEREFORE THOUGH HE COULD HAVE WISHED ALI BABA WOULD HAVE DECLINED THE DANCE HE PRETENDED TO BE OBLIGED TO HIM FOR IT AND HAD THE COMPLAISANCE TO EXPRESS HIS SATISFACTION AT WHAT HE SAW WHICH PLEASED HIS HOST
WHICH RAISED SUCH A GREAT HEAP OF GOLD AS DAZZLED HIS WIFE'S EYES AND THEN HE TOLD HER THE WHOLE ADVENTURE FROM BEGINNING TO END AND ABOVE ALL RECOMMENDED HER TO KEEP IT SECRET THE WIFE REJOICED GREATLY AT THEIR GOOD FORTUNE AND WOULD COUNT ALL THE GOLD PIECE BY PIECE
TO WHICH THERE HUNG A PONIARD WITH A HILT AND GUARD OF THE SAME METAL AND PUT A HANDSOME MASK ON HER FACE WHEN SHE HAD THUS DISGUISED HERSELF SHE SAID TO ABDALLA
AND THEREFORE RESOLVED TO TAKE UPON HIMSELF THE IMPORTANT COMMISSION ACCORDINGLY HE WENT AND ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO BABA MUSTAPHA
IN A CASE WHEREIN THERE WAS SOME MINUTES BEFORE SCARCE ANY ROOM TO HOPE I BELIEVE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPRESS TO THE LIFE WHAT THE ECSTASIES AND TRANSPORTS OF THE SOUL ARE WHEN IT IS SO SAVED
AND AS THE MOUTHS OF THE JARS WERE RATHER TOO NARROW FOR HIS PURPOSE THE CAPTAIN CAUSED THEM TO BE WIDENED
PULLING AS WELL AS WE COULD TOWARD LAND WHAT THE SHORE WAS WHETHER ROCK OR SAND WHETHER STEEP OR SHOAL WE KNEW NOT THE ONLY HOPE THAT COULD RATIONALLY GIVE US THE LEAST SHADOW OF EXPECTATION WAS IF WE MIGHT HAPPEN INTO SOME BAY OR GULF
I HAD NO SOONER FIRED THAN FROM ALL PARTS OF THE WOOD THERE AROSE AN INNUMERABLE NUMBER OF FOWLS OF MANY SORTS MAKING A CONFUSED SCREAMING AND CRYING AND EVERY ONE ACCORDING TO HIS USUAL NOTE
THESE FIVE RELEASED AT LAST SO THAT THERE WERE TWELVE IN ALL BESIDES FIVE WE KEPT PRISONERS IN THE CAVE FOR HOSTAGES I ASKED THE CAPTAIN IF HE WERE WILLING TO VENTURE WITH THESE HANDS ON BOARD THE SHIP
SOUGHT TO SOFTEN MY SORROW BY HONORING THE FUNERAL CEREMONY WITH THEIR PRESENCE AND AT THE TERMINATION OF THE CEREMONY I WAS LOWERED INTO THE PIT
HE WRAPPED SOME UP IN THE SKIRTS OF HIS VEST AND CRAMMED HIS BOSOM AS FULL AS IT COULD HOLD ALADDIN HAVING THUS LOADED HIMSELF WITH RICHES OF WHICH HE KNEW NOT THE VALUE
AS THE RAGE OF THE WIND WAS STILL GREAT THOUGH RATHER LESS THAN AT FIRST WE COULD NOT SO MUCH AS HOPE TO HAVE THE SHIP HOLD MANY MINUTES WITHOUT BREAKING IN PIECES UNLESS THE WINDS BY A KIND OF MIRACLE SHOULD TURN IMMEDIATELY ABOUT IN A WORD WE SAT LOOKING ONE UPON ANOTHER
HOW CAME THAT VILE GENIE TO ADDRESS HIMSELF TO ME AND NOT TO YOU TO WHOM HE HAD APPEARED BEFORE IN THE CAVE MOTHER ANSWERED ALADDIN THE GENIE YOU SAW IS NOT THE ONE WHO APPEARED TO ME IF YOU REMEMBER
WITH LAND ON BOTH SIDES AND A STRONG CURRENT OF TIDE RUNNING UP I LOOKED ON BOTH SIDES FOR A PROPER PLACE TO GET TO SHORE FOR I WAS NOT WILLING TO BE DRIVEN TOO HIGH UP THE RIVER HOPING IN TIME TO SEE SOME SHIPS AT SEA
AND WENT TO HIM IN THE MORNING BEFORE SUNRISE ALI BABA SAID HE I AM SURPRISED AT YOU YOU PRETEND TO BE MISERABLY POOR AND YET YOU MEASURE GOLD MY WIFE FOUND THIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MEASURE YOU BORROWED YESTERDAY BY THIS DISCOURSE
A WORK WHICH FATIGUED ME VERY MUCH AFTER THIS I WENT EVERY DAY ON BOARD AND BROUGHT AWAY WHAT I COULD GET I HAD BEEN NOW THIRTEEN DAYS ON SHORE AND HAD BEEN ELEVEN TIMES ON BOARD THE SHIP
WHAT LITTLE WIND THERE WAS BLEW ME TOWARDS THE LAND AND THUS HAVING FOUND TWO OR THREE BROKEN OARS BELONGING TO THE BOAT AND BESIDES THE TOOLS WHICH WERE IN THE CHEST I FOUND TWO SAWS AN AXE AND A HAMMER WITH THIS CARGO I PUT TO SEA
YOU SHALL ALWAYS FIND ME READY TO KEEP MY WORD THIS PLAN JUST SUITED ALADDIN WHO HATED WORK HE TOLD THE MAGICIAN HE HAD A GREATER INCLINATION TO THAT BUSINESS THAN TO ANY OTHER AND THAT HE SHOULD BE MUCH OBLIGED TO HIM FOR HIS KINDNESS WELL THEN
I WENT TO THE BREAD ROOM AND FILLED MY POCKETS WITH BISCUIT AND ATE IT AS I WENT ABOUT OTHER THINGS
IN SHORT THERE WAS FRUIT OF ALL COLORS THE WHITE WERE PEARLS THE CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT DIAMONDS THE DEEP RED RUBIES THE PALER
CARESSED HIM IN THE MOST ENGAGING MANNER MADE HIM SOME SMALL PRESENTS AND OFTEN ASKED HIM TO DINE AND SUP WITH HIM WHEN HE TREATED HIM VERY HANDSOMELY
IT IS A TALISMAN AGAINST ALL EVIL SO LONG AS YOU OBEY ME GO THEREFORE BOLDLY AND WE SHALL BOTH BE RICH ALL OUR LIVES ALADDIN DESCENDED THE STEPS AND OPENING THE DOOR FOUND THE THREE HALLS JUST AS THE AFRICAN MAGICIAN HAD DESCRIBED
OR THE MOUTH OF SOME RIVER WHERE BY GREAT CHANCE WE MIGHT HAVE RUN OUR BOAT IN OR GOT UNDER THE LEE OF THE LAND AND PERHAPS MADE SMOOTH WATER BUT THERE WAS NOTHING OF THIS APPEARED BUT AS WE MADE NEARER AND NEARER THE SHORE THE LAND LOOKED MORE FRIGHTFUL THAN THE SEA
THERE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO ME IN MY ADOLESCENCE THAT NO DISCIPLINE OF REASON WILL EVER BRING TO A JUST PROPORTION FOR ME THE FIRST HUMILIATIONS I WAS MADE TO SUFFER
AND THE STATE PLATO AND CAMPANELLA FOR ALL THAT THE LATTER WAS A CHRISTIAN PRIEST CARRIED COMMUNISM TO ITS FINAL POINT
IT MAY BE THESE GREAT GENTLEMEN
SECTION TWO NOW IF THIS UTOPIAN WORLD IS TO BE IN SOME DEGREE PARALLEL TO CONTEMPORARY THOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN CONCERNED
FOR THAT IS THE QUALITY OF HIS TYPE HE GETS NO PERSONAL EXPRESSION IN THIS BOOK THE VOICE IS ALWAYS THAT OTHER'S
ON WHICH MOVING PICTURES INTERMITTENTLY APPEAR
AT ONCE POSSIBLE AND MORE DESIRABLE THAN THE WORLD IN WHICH I LIVE BUT THIS BOOK HAS BROUGHT ME BACK TO IMAGINATIVE WRITING AGAIN IN ITS TWO PREDECESSORS THE TREATMENT OF SOCIAL ORGANISATION HAD BEEN PURELY OBJECTIVE
WITH A COMPLICATED DIFFICULTY AND NOT A LITTLE UNJUST TO A HIGHLY RESPECTABLE ELEMENT GOLD IS ABUSED AND MADE INTO VESSELS OF DISHONOUR AND ABOLISHED FROM IDEAL SOCIETY
ALL SORTS OF PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL SLUGGISHNESS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNSOCIAL PREOCCUPATIONS OF MANY SORTS WOMEN SAMURAI WHO ARE MARRIED MY DOUBLE TOLD ME
NOW NEWTON DARWIN DALTON DAVY JOULE AND ADAM SMITH DID NOT AFFECT THIS EXPERT HANKEY PANKEY BECOMING ENOUGH IN A HAIRDRESSER OR A FASHIONABLE PHYSICIAN
IF YOUR MIND IS MADE UP UPON SUCH ISSUES YOUR TIME WILL BE WASTED ON THESE PAGES AND EVEN IF YOU ARE A WILLING READER YOU MAY REQUIRE A LITTLE PATIENCE FOR THE PECULIAR METHOD I HAVE THIS TIME ADOPTED
WE OF THE SUCCEEDING GENERATION CAN SEE QUITE CLEARLY THAT FOR THE MOST PART THE HEAT AND ZEAL OF THESE DISCUSSIONS AROSE IN THE CONFUSION OF A QUANTITATIVE FOR A QUALITATIVE QUESTION
IT IS NO LONGER TO BE STATIC AND THIS ALTERS THE GENERAL CONDITION OF THE UTOPIAN PROBLEM PROFOUNDLY WE HAVE TO PROVIDE
OF SERVICES AND COMMODITIES ALMOST CERTAINLY THEY WILL NEED TO HAVE MONEY THEY WILL HAVE MONEY AND IT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT FOR ALL HIS SORROWFUL THOUGHTS OUR BOTANIST
YOU MIGHT HAVE MET ANYONE ALMOST AT THAT SEASON AND FORMED THE SAME ATTACHMENT FOR A TIME HE IS PERPLEXED AND TROUBLED BY THIS SUGGESTION NO HE SAYS A LITTLE DOUBTFULLY NO IT WAS HERSELF THEN EMPHATICALLY
DENIED PRIVACY AND RULED AN ABSOLUTE COMMUNITY OF GOODS AT ANY RATE AND SO COMING TO THE VICTORIAN UTOPIAS DID CABET BUT CABET'S COMMUNISM WAS ONE OF THE FREE STORE TYPE AND THE GOODS WERE YOURS
MAKES HIS EXPERIMENT AND EITHER FAILS DIES AND COMES TO AN END OR SUCCEEDS AND IMPRESSES HIMSELF IN OFFSPRING IN CONSEQUENCES AND RESULTS INTELLECTUAL MATERIAL AND MORAL UPON THE WORLD
THEY HAVE THE PRECISEST DIRECTIONS IN SUCH MATTERS THE BODY MUST BE IN HEALTH
COMMODITIES FROM A CENTRAL STORE FOOTNOTE MORE'S
SHE WORE A WOMANLY DRESS OF GREYISH GREEN PROBABLY UNDER THE LESSER RULE
THERE WILL BE NO SHOCK IN THE IDEA THAT A GENERAL CONSOLIDATION OF A GREAT NUMBER OF COMMON PUBLIC SERVICES OVER AREAS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE IS NOW NOT ONLY PRACTICABLE BUT VERY DESIRABLE
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW I GOT HERE I'VE CEASED EVEN TO WONDER HOW I GOT HERE
REMINDS ONE MORE STRONGLY THAN THE LAST OF THE GAME OF CROQUET ALICE PLAYED IN WONDERLAND WHEN THE MALLETS WERE FLAMINGOES AND THE BALLS WERE HEDGEHOGS AND CRAWLED AWAY
HE LEANS BACK IN HIS CHAIR AND I IN MINE AND THE ABSURD PARODY OF OUR ATTITUDE STRIKES US BOTH WELL WE SAY SIMULTANEOUSLY AND LAUGH TOGETHER I WILL CONFESS THIS MEETING IS MORE DIFFICULT EVEN THAN I ANTICIPATED
AGILE IN HIS MOVEMENTS AND WITH A SLIGHT TONSORIAL BALDNESS A PENNY MIGHT COVER IT OF THE CROWN HIS FRONT IS CONVEX HE DROOPS AT TIMES LIKE MOST OF US
PERIODICALLY AVAILABLE IN EACH LOCALITY AND BOOKED AND SPOKEN OF IN THESE PHYSICAL UNITS ACCOUNTS BETWEEN CENTRAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULD BE KEPT IN THESE TERMS
IT WAS PROPOSED TO SELECT SOME PARTICULAR DAY WHEN THE ECONOMIC ATMOSPHERE WAS DISTINCTLY EQUABLE AND TO DECLARE
CONTROL LET OR ADMINISTER ALL NATURAL PRODUCTIONS PAY FOR AND SECURE HEALTHY BIRTHS AND A HEALTHY AND VIGOROUS NEW GENERATION MAINTAIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH COIN MONEY
AND DREAM LIKE PHRASEOLOGY YET I BROUGHT AWAY AN IMPRESSION THAT HERE WAS A RIGHTNESS THAT EARTHLY ECONOMISTS HAVE FAILED TO GRASP
AND AN AUTOMATIC IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE CITIZENS IN GENERAL AS AGAINST THE CREDITOR CLASS
INDEED FOR ITS PURPOSES BUT AS NATURAL A GROWTH AS THE BONES IN A MAN'S WRIST AND I DO NOT SEE HOW ONE CAN IMAGINE ANYTHING AT ALL WORTHY OF BEING CALLED A CIVILISATION WITHOUT IT
AND FLUCTUATING CONVENTION THAT VALUE IS CAPABLE OF IMPERSONAL TREATMENT ONLY IN THE CASE OF THE MOST GENERALISED REQUIREMENTS WEALTH WAS MEASURED BY THE STANDARDS OF EXCHANGE
IT IS MOREOVER OF A FAIR ROUND SIZE AND THE INSCRIPTION DECLARES IT ONE LION EQUAL TO TWAINDY BRONZE CROSSES UNLESS THE RATIO OF METALS IS VERY DIFFERENT HERE
HIM YOU MUST IMAGINE AS SITTING AT A TABLE READING A MANUSCRIPT ABOUT UTOPIAS A MANUSCRIPT HE HOLDS IN TWO HANDS THAT ARE JUST A LITTLE FAT AT THE WRIST THE CURTAIN RISES UPON HIM SO
SOMEBODY WHO HAD FOUND THE GOTHIC SPIRIT ENCHANTED PETRIFIED IN A CATHEDRAL AND HAD SET IT FREE BUT WHAT HAS THIS HE ASKS TO DO WITH HER VERY MUCH I SAY
AND MYSELF AS THE INTRUSIVE CHAIRMAN INSISTING WITH A BLAND RUTHLESSNESS UPON HIS FEW WORDS OF INTRODUCTION BEFORE HE RECEDES INTO THE WINGS AND IF FURTHERMORE YOU FIGURE
HAPPILY THE DEAD PAST BURIES ITS DEAD AND IT IS NOT OUR FUNCTION NOW TO ADJUDICATE THE PREPONDERANCE OF VICTORY IN THE VERY DAYS WHEN OUR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ORDER
WE CONCLUDE THAT WHATEVER OTHER TYPES OF PROPERTY MAY EXIST ALL NATURAL SOURCES OF FORCE AND INDEED ALL STRICTLY NATURAL PRODUCTS COAL WATER POWER AND THE LIKE
AND I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE UNTEMPERED HERE IS A WORLD AND A GLORIOUS WORLD AND IT IS FOR ME TO TAKE HOLD OF IT TO HAVE TO DO WITH IT HERE AND NOW AND BEHOLD I CAN ONLY THINK THAT I AM BURNT AND SCARRED AND THERE RANKLES THAT WRETCHED PIECE OF BUSINESS
UNEXPECTED SPATE OF GOLD PRODUCTION
MUST BEAR CHILDREN IF THEY ARE TO REMAIN MARRIED AS WELL AS IN THE ORDER BEFORE THE SECOND PERIOD FOR TERMINATING A CHILDLESS MARRIAGE IS EXHAUSTED
A RESTRICTION UPON WHAT ONE MAY TAKE A NEED FOR EVIDENCES OF EQUIVALENT VALUE A LIMITATION TO HUMAN CREDIT IT DATES
THERE IS ONE LIBERTY ACCORDED TO WOMEN SAMURAI WHICH IS REFUSED TO MEN AND THAT IS TO MARRY OUTSIDE THE RULE AND WOMEN MARRIED TO MEN NOT UNDER THE RULE ARE ALSO FREE TO BECOME SAMURAI
FOR NOVELS AND THE DRAMA OF LIFE IN PRACTICE IT SEEMS THAT IT IS ONLY MEN OF GREAT POIETIC DISTINCTION OUTSIDE THE RULE OR GREAT COMMERCIAL LEADERS WHO HAVE WIVES UNDER IT THE TENDENCY OF SUCH UNIONS IS EITHER TO BRING THE HUSBAND UNDER THE RULE
HIS TRAINING HAS BEEN SUBTLY FINER THAN MINE HE HAS MADE HIMSELF A BETTER FACE THAN MINE THESE THINGS I MIGHT HAVE COUNTED UPON
SHE RAISED HERS TO HIS FACE WITH AN EXPRESSION OF CONFIDING AFFECTION AND AS THOUGH SHE HAD READ HIS THOUGHTS YES PAPA SHE SAID I LOVE YOU DEARLY DEARLY TOO
HOW PRETTY SHE LOOKS AND THERE'S THAT MISS STEVENS COMING OUT NOW HATEFUL THING I CAN'T BEAR HER COME ELSIE AND CARRY AND SHE RAN OUT CAROLINE AND ELSIE FOLLOWING
NO LUCY I MUST OBEY MY FATHER ELSIE ANSWERED IN A VERY PLEASANT BUT NO LESS DECIDED TONE SOME ONE CAUGHT HER ROUND THE WAIST AND LIFTED HER UP OH PAPA SHE EXCLAIMED I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE THERE
PROCEEDED DELIBERATELY TO BLOT NEARLY EVERY PAGE IN IT ON SOME HE MADE A LARGE BLOT ON OTHERS A SMALL ONE AND ON SOME TWO OR THREE AND ALSO SCRIBBLED BETWEEN THE LINES AND ON THE MARGIN SO AS COMPLETELY TO DEFACE POOR ELSIE'S WORK
CARRY HOWARD AND A GOOD MANY OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS ARE COMING YOU KNOW
AND THEN GRADUALLY RETURNED TO HIS ORDINARY STERN COLD MANNER INDEED BEFORE THE WEEK WAS OUT SHE WAS AGAIN IN SAD DISGRACE SHE WAS WALKING ALONE IN THE GARDEN ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HER ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED BY A SLIGHT FLUTTERING NOISE
AND DRAWING THE MINIATURE FROM HER BOSOM BUT AS HE TOUCHED THE SPRING THE CASE FLEW OPEN REVEALING THE SWEET GIRLISH FACE IT NEEDED NOT ELSIE'S LOW MURMURED MAMMA TO TELL HIM WHO THAT LOVELY LADY WAS
THEN PUTTING IT CAREFULLY IN ITS PLACE SHE CLOSED AND LOCKED THE DESK
THANK YOU DEAR PAPA THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOES IT PLEASE YOU MY DARLING HE ASKED STOOPING TO PRESS A KISS ON THE LITTLE UPTURNED FACE SO BRIGHT AND HAPPY YES PAPA
BUT THEN ADELAIDE HAD JUST LEFT HOME TO PAY A VISIT TO A FRIEND LIVING AT SOME DISTANCE
REALLY ELSIE I AM SORELY TEMPTED TO ADMINISTER A VERY SEVERE PUNISHMENT ELSIE CAUGHT AT THE ARM OF THE SETTEE FOR SUPPORT TELL ME WHAT YOU DID IT FOR WAS IT PURE LOVE OF MISCHIEF ASKED HER FATHER STERNLY TAKING HOLD OF HER ARM AND HOLDING HER UP BY IT
CREATE IN ME A CLEAN HEART O GOD AND RENEW A RIGHT SPIRIT WITHIN ME WHERE DID YOU LEARN ALL THIS HE ASKED LOOKING AT HER WITH MINGLED SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION IN THE BIBLE SIR SHE MODESTLY REPLIED YOU SEEM TO HAVE READ IT TO SOME PURPOSE SAID HE
WHO HAD PUT HER TRUST IN JESUS BUT THEY WERE NOT TO PERISH THUS FOR AT THAT MOMENT A POWERFUL NEGRO
OH YES MAMMY AND THAT REMINDS ME THAT PAPA SAID I MUST EAT A CRACKER OR SOMETHING BEFORE I TAKE MY WALK BECAUSE HE THINKS IT ISN'T GOOD FOR PEOPLE TO EXERCISE MUCH ON AN ENTIRELY EMPTY STOMACH SAID ELSIE
NO DAUGHTER I AM SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU BUT I AM AFRAID YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TO BE TRUSTED ON SUCH AN EXPEDITION WITH ONLY A SERVANT YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW WHEN I CAN TAKE YOU MYSELF BUT PAPA WE WANT TO GO TO DAY
SAYING TO THE ELDER MISTER DINSMORE THAT HE WAS GOING TO RIDE OVER TO ION AND WOULD PROBABLY NOT RETURN BEFORE NIGHT THEN WITH A SIGH THE LITTLE GIRL WENT BACK TO HER OWN ROOM TO PREPARE HER MORNING LESSONS
AND ATTENDED TO THE OUTWARD OBSERVANCES OF RELIGION WERE QUITE SAFE HE COULD SEE NO NECESSITY FOR A CHANGE OF HEART HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE DOCTRINE OF TOTAL DEPRAVITY NOT HE NO INDEED HE THOUGHT THE WORLD MUCH BETTER THAN MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE
GO NOW AND LET MAMMY GET YOU READY FOR DINNER AS ELSIE WAS SITTING ALONE IN HER ROOM THAT AFTERNOON
WHICH SEEMED TO PROCEED FROM AN ARBOR NEAR BY AND ON HASTILY TURNING IN TO ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE SHE FOUND A TINY AND BEAUTIFUL HUMMING BIRD CONFINED UNDER A GLASS VASE IN ITS STRUGGLES TO ESCAPE IT WAS FLUTTERING AND BEATING AGAINST THE WALLS OF ITS PRISON
SUCH AS RIDING OUT FOR PLEASURE ON THE SABBATH READING SECULAR NEWSPAPERS AND ENGAGING IN WORLDLY CONVERSATION AND SHE GREATLY FEARED HE DID NOT BUT INSTEAD OF ANSWERING HER QUESTION HE ASKED DO YOU ELSIE OH YES SIR
SEEING IT WAS USELESS TO TRY TO MOVE HIM LORA TURNED AWAY AND HURRIED TO HORACE'S ROOM WHICH IN HER HASTE SHE ENTERED WITHOUT KNOCKING HE HAVING FORTUNATELY NEGLECTED TO FASTEN THE DOOR SHE WAS JUST IN TIME HE HAD A SMALL RIDING WHIP IN HIS HAND
NOT TO NIGHT TO MORROW AFTER BREAKFAST YOU MAY EAT THE CREAM CANDY AND THE ROCK BUT NONE OF THE OTHERS THEY ARE COLORED AND VERY UNWHOLESOME WON'T YOU EAT SOME PAPA SHE ASKED WITH WINNING SWEETNESS NO DEAREST HE SAID
INDEED IT DOES AND I FEEL RICHER IN THAT POSSESSION THAN ALL THE GOLD OF CALIFORNIA COULD MAKE ME HE SAID PRESSING HER TO HIS HEART SHE LOOKED SURPASSINGLY LOVELY AT THAT MOMENT HER CHEEKS BURNING AND HER EYES SPARKLING WITH EXCITEMENT
BUT DREW IT BACK AGAIN AND STOOD FOR A MOMENT BALANCING IN HIS MIND THE CHANCES OF DETECTION HE COULD DEFACE ELSIE'S COPY BOOK BUT ADELAIDE COULD TESTIFY TO THE LITTLE GIRL'S CAREFULNESS AND THE NEATNESS OF HER WORK UP TO THAT VERY DAY FOR SHE HAD BEEN IN THE SCHOOL ROOM THAT MORNING DURING THE WRITING HOUR
AND THE TEARS FELL FASTER AND FASTER INDEED SAID HE YOU HAD NO BUSINESS TO MEDDLE WITH IT LET WHO WOULD HAVE PUT IT THERE WHICH HAND DID IT THIS ONE PAPA SOBBED THE CHILD INDICATING HER RIGHT HAND HE TOOK IT IN HIS AND HELD IT A MOMENT
SHE HELD UP HER FACE FOR A KISS WHICH HE GAVE I WISH I COULD ALWAYS BE GOOD PAPA SHE SAID BUT I AM NAUGHTY SO OFTEN NO SAID HE I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL FOR QUITE A LONG TIME
BUT NOW SHE FELT SO SURE IT WOULD BE SAFER WITH HER THAN WITH HIM
THEY CHATTED A FEW MOMENTS IN THE DRAWING ROOM AND THEN ELSIE CARRIED HER FRIEND OFF WITH HER TO HER OWN ROOM THAT THEY MIGHT GO ON WITH THEIR TALK WHILE SHE WAS GETTING DRESSED FOR DINNER
AND I BELIEVE HIM I DID GO TO HIM AND HE DID NOT CAST ME OUT BUT FORGAVE MY SINS AND TAUGHT ME TO LOVE HIM AND DESIRE TO SERVE HIM ALL MY LIFE THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE GENTLEMAN AND THE LITTLE GIRL HAD DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF ALL PRESENT
AH I FORGOT I MUSTN'T TELL PAPA PAPA CRIED ELSIE CATCHING HOLD OF HIS HAND
MY OWN PAPA I'M SO GLAD I DO BELONG TO YOU SHE SAID THROWING HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK AND LAYING HER CHEEK TO HIS FOR AN INSTANT
UNLESS SHE HAD HIS EXPRESS PERMISSION TO REMAIN UP LONGER SHE LAY AWAKE FOR SOME TIME THINKING OF HIS UNWONTED KINDNESS AND INDULGING FOND HOPES FOR THE FUTURE THEN FELL ASLEEP TO DREAM
AND THEN KNEELING DOWN SHE ASKED FORGIVENESS OF GOD A FULL HOUR SHE HAD BEEN THERE ALONE AND THE TIME HAD SEEMED VERY LONG WHEN AT LAST THE DOOR OPENED AND HER FATHER CAME IN ELSIE ROSE AND CAME FORWARD TO MEET HIM
ELSIE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS WITH A LIGHT HEART A HEART THAT THRILLED WITH A NEW AND STRANGE SENSE OF HAPPINESS AS SHE REMEMBERED HER FATHER'S EVIDENT ANXIETY FOR HER SAFETY DURING THEIR PERILOUS RIDE RECALLING EACH WORD AND LOOK
THAT LAST ASSURANCE I CONSIDER QUITE SUFFICIENT OF ITSELF TO ESTABLISH HER INNOCENCE LORA TURNED AND WENT OUT FEELING VERY HAPPY AND AS SHE CLOSED THE DOOR ELSIE'S PAPA TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS SAYING IN LOVING TENDER TONES MY POOR LITTLE DAUGHTER MY OWN DARLING CHILD
I WILL PAPA SHE REPLIED MEEKLY BUT INDEED I CANNOT HELP FEELING FRIGHTENED WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY WITH ME
FOR THOUGH I TOO AM FOND OF SWEET THINGS I WILL NOT EAT THEM WHILE I REFUSE THEM TO YOU DO PAPA SHE URGED IT WOULD GIVE ME PLEASURE TO SEE YOU ENJOYING IT NO DARLING I WILL WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW TOO
ADELAIDE SCARCELY LESS ALARMED WHILE ENNA CLUNG TO HER SOBBING MOST BITTERLY ELSIE ALONE PRESERVED A CHEERFUL SERENITY SHE HAD BUILT HER HOUSE UPON THE ROCK AND KNEW THAT IT WOULD STAND HER DESTINY WAS IN HER HEAVENLY FATHER'S HANDS
I KNOW THAT ALL THIS IS IN REVENGE FOR ELSIE'S FORCED TESTIMONY IN THE AFFAIR OF THE WATCH AND I GAVE YOU FAIR WARNING THEN THAT I WOULD SEE TO IT THAT ANY ATTEMPT TO ABUSE MY CHILD SHOULD RECEIVE ITS JUST REWARD HE TOOK THE BOY BY THE ARM AS HE SPOKE TO LEAD HIM FROM THE ROOM
AND HALF HOPING THAT HE WOULD SEND FOR HER WHEN THEY HAD GONE SHE WATCHED THE CLOCK AND LISTENED INTENTLY FOR EVERY SOUND BUT HER BEDTIME CAME AND SHE DARED NOT STAY UP ANY LONGER FOR HIS ORDERS HAD BEEN PEREMPTORY THAT SHE SHOULD ALWAYS RETIRE PRECISELY AT THAT HOUR
BUT JIM HAS DONE VERY WRONG AND DESERVES HIS PUNISHMENT AND I CANNOT INTERFERE
ELSIE STOOD A MOMENT LOOKING MUCH PERPLEXED THEN WITH A BRIGHTENING FACE EXCLAIMED IN HER CHEERFUL PLEASANT WAY WELL NEVER MIND FLORA DEAR I WILL GET YOU MY DOLL
HE GAZED UPON IT WITH EMOTION CARRIED BACK IN MEMORY TO THE TIME WHEN FOR A FEW SHORT MONTHS SHE HAD BEEN HIS OWN MOST CHERISHED TREASURE THEN LOOKING FROM IT TO HIS CHILD HE MURMURED YES SHE IS VERY LIKE THE SAME FEATURES
SHE HASTILY CROSSED THE ROOM AND SPEAKING IN A LOW TONE SAID ARTHUR YOU HAVE HAD A HAND IN THIS BUSINESS I VERY WELL KNOW NOW CONFESS IT QUICKLY OR HORACE WILL HALF KILL ELSIE YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SAID HE DOGGEDLY
MY POOR BOY SEEMS TO GET THE BLAME OF EVERYTHING THAT GOES WRONG HE GETS NO MORE THAN HE DESERVES REPLIED HER HUSBAND ANGRILY ARTHUR ARTHUR I SAY WHERE ARE YOU
AND FROM BEGINNING TO END IT GAVE EVIDENCE OF PAINSTAKING CAREFULNESS AND DECIDED IMPROVEMENT AH SURELY THIS WILL PLEASE DEAR PAPA SHE EXCLAIMED HALF ALOUD HOW GOOD AUNT ADELAIDE WAS TO SIT HERE WITH ME
FOR IT MUST HAVE BEEN THEN THE MISCHIEF WAS DONE HAD YOU IT WITH YOU WHEN YOU RODE OUT SUDDENLY ELSIE'S FACE FLUSHED AND SHE EXCLAIMED EAGERLY
SUCKLING'S AGLAURA IT WAS FRIDAY AND THE NEXT MORNING WAS THE WHEN THE REPORTS WERE TO BE PRESENTED SCHOOL HAD CLOSED AND ALL BUT ELSIE HAD ALREADY LEFT THE ROOM
WHAT IF WE HAD BEEN KILLED WHERE WOULD WE ALL BE NOW WHERE WOULD I HAVE BEEN I BELIEVE YOU WOULD HAVE GONE STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN ELSIE BUT
WHAT IS YOUR PERPLEXITY WELL REPLIED EDWARD SINCE IT IS TO BE SO LET US SIT DOWN AND TALK OVER THE MATTER I ACKNOWLEDGE THE KINDNESS OF MISTER HEATHERSTONE
IT IS SO I BELIEVE REPLIED EDWARD YES NOW THAT EDITH SMILES I'M SURE IT IS THEM YES REPLIED GRENVILLE
AND TURENNE I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WILL BE OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER SOON THAT WILL BE THE BETTER FOR YOU AS YOU WILL LEARN TACTICS FROM SUCH GREAT PLAYERS WHICH WOULD YOUR MAJESTY RECOMMEND ME TO FOLLOW INQUIRED EDWARD
AS THE SAYING IS HER FATHER WILL RESIGN THE PROPERTY TO YOU AS YOURS BY RIGHT BUT YOU HAVE NO PROPERTY IN HIS DAUGHTER AND I SUSPECT THAT SHE WILL NOT BE QUITE SO EASILY HANDED OVER TO YOU
WHY HAS HE REBUILT ARNWOOD HE IS NOT GOING TO SURRENDER MY PROPERTY AND MAKE ME A PRESENT OF THE HOUSE
CONDE IS JUST NOW RELEASED FROM VINCENNES BUT DEPEND UPON IT HE WILL BE IN ARMS VERY SOON AS SOON AS HE WAS FURNISHED WITH THE NECESSARY CREDENTIALS FROM THE KING EDWARD PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE LEVEE OF THE PRINCE OF CONDE
SAID THE PRINCE IN SECURING THE SERVICES OF SUCH FINE YOUNG MEN YOU WILL OBLIGE ME BY ENLISTING AS MANY OF YOUR COUNTRYMEN AS YOU MAY CONSIDER LIKELY TO DO GOOD SERVICE AND THEN FOLLOW ME TO GUIENNE TO WHICH PROVINCE I AM NOW ABOUT TO DEPART
I TRUST THAT THE DAUGHTER WILL OFTEN GRACE OUR COURT PATIENCE MADE NO REPLY BUT PASSED ON AND SOON AFTERWARD EDWARD LOST SIGHT OF HER IN THE CROWD
AND THE CONTENTS REMOVED A HEAVY LOAD FROM EDWARD'S MIND BUT HE NOW THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT WAR AND ALTHOUGH HE CHERISHED THE IDEA OF PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE HE WAS RESOLVED TO FOLLOW THE FORTUNES OF THE PRINCE AS LONG AS HE COULD
AT ALL EVENTS I WILL NOT GO TO THE HEIGHT OF THE FASHION REPLIED EDWARD LAUGHING SOME OF THE HATS ARE NOT QUITE SO TALL AS THE OTHERS HERE IS THE SHOP FOR THE HAT AND FOR THE SWORD BELT EDWARD CHOSE A HAT AND A PLAIN SWORD BELT
THAT EVERY THING MAY BE READY I SUPPOSE SIR I MUST CHANGE MY ATTIRE REPLIED EDWARD LOOKING AT HIS FORESTER'S DRESS THAT WILL HARDLY ACCORD WITH THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY
EDWARD WENT TO CHALONER AND GRENVILLE WHO WERE DELIGHTED WITH THE INTELLIGENCE WHICH HE BROUGHT THEM THE NEXT DAY THEY WERE AT THE PRINCE'S LEVEE AND INTRODUCED BY EDWARD I AM FORTUNATE GENTLEMEN
AND EXPELLED KING CHARLES FROM THE FRENCH FRONTIERS THE WAR WAS STILL CARRIED ON IN THE NETHERLANDS TURENNE BORE DOWN CONDE WHO HAD GAINED EVERY CAMPAIGN AND THE COURT OF SPAIN WEARIED WITH REVERSES
I SEE NO REASON TO THE CONTRARY WELL THEN THAT IS SETTLED AND I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR ACCOMMODATION PATIENCE AND CLARA ARE IN THE NEXT ROOM YOU CAN JOIN THEM AND YOU WILL MAKE MY DAUGHTER VERY HAPPY
NOT EXACTLY REPLIED OSWALD BUT I THINK
OSWALD HAD RIDDEN OVER ON A PONY EDWARD ARRANGED TO TAKE BILLY AND RETURN WITH HIM THEY STARTED EARLY THE NEXT MORNING AND EDWARD ASKED OSWALD
WHICH HAS BEEN SO LONG HELD BY OTHERS
AND WILL FIND THEMSELVES IN THE FOREST ALL THE YEAR ROUND I WON'T KILL ANY OF THE FEMALES FOR THE FIRST YEAR OR TWO AND AFTER THAT I EXPECT WE SHALL HAVE A FLOCK SUFFICIENT TO MEET ANY DEMAND UPON IT IT IS NOT A BAD IDEA HUMPHREY THEY WILL ALWAYS COME HOME
BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF THEY WERE TO MEET THE PARTIES AND CLOSE WITH THEM AT ONCE BEFORE THE KING'S INTENTIONS ARE KNOWN THEY WOULD RECOVER THEIR PROPERTY AT A THIRD OR A QUARTER OF THE VALUE NOW IS THEIR TIME
WHICH I CAN NOT DO WHILE I AM SECLUDED IN THE FOREST AND DEPEND UPON IT WE SHALL HAVE STIRRING NEWS I SUPPOSE YOU THINK THAT THE KING WILL COME OVER REPLIED OSWALD I FEEL CERTAIN OF IT OSWALD
AND A SEVERE ACTION WAS FOUGHT IN THE STREETS OF THE SUBURB OF SAINT ANTOINE IN WHICH NEITHER PARTY HAD THE ADVANTAGE
LET HER FATHER BUT GIVE ME HER AND ARNWOOD WILL BE BUT A TRIFLE IN ADDITION WITH RESPECT TO THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH YOU ARE TO POSSESS ARNWOOD SAID HUMPHREY I CAN INFORM YOU WHAT THEY ARE
AND THEN HIS DAUGHTER WAS LED FORWARD AND INTRODUCED BY A LADY UNKNOWN TO EDWARD AFTER HE HAD SALUTED HER THE KING SAID LOUD ENOUGH FOR EDWARD TO HEAR
THUS DID THEY CONTINUE TALKING OVER MATTERS TILL THEY ARRIVED AT THE COTTAGE ALICE CAME OUT TO THEM SAYING TO HUMPHREY
NAY EDWARD RECOLLECT THAT I HAVE AS EDITH OBSERVED PASSED MY LIFE IN THE WOODS EDWARD WAS MOST KINDLY RECEIVED BY MISTER HEATHERSTONE EDWARD
HUMPHREY LEFT EDWARD TO PUT AWAY THESE IN THE CART WHILE HE WENT OUT A SECOND TIME TO SEE THE GOATS HE MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE MAN WHO HAD THEM FOR SALE FOR A MALE AND THREE FEMALES WITH TWO KIDS EACH AT THEIR SIDES
I DARE SAY I SHALL EAT MORE THAN YOU DO CLARA SO YOU OUGHT A GREAT BIG MAN LIKE YOU HOW OLD ARE YOU EDWARD SAID CLARA I AM THIRTEEN PATIENCE IS PAST SIXTEEN NOW HOW OLD ARE YOU
WERE AMONG THE MOST FAVORED OF THOSE IN HIS TRAIN AS THE PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY ALONG THE STRAND THROUGH A COUNTLESS MULTITUDE THE WINDOWS OF ALL THE HOUSES WERE FILLED WITH WELL DRESSED LADIES WHO WAVED THEIR WHITE KERCHIEFS TO THE KING
I CAN BUT GIVE IT A TRIAL AND LEAVE IF I FIND IT TOO ARDUOUS OR TOO IRKSOME TOO ARDUOUS IT SHALL NOT BE THAT SHALL BE MY CONCERN AND TOO IRKSOME I HOPE YOU WILL NOT FIND IT
INDEED I OUGHT TO FEEL GRATEFUL TO HER FOR IF SHE HAD NOT GIVEN ME SO BAD A BED THAT NIGHT I NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN SO COMFORTABLY LODGED AS IT IS PROPOSED THAT I SHALL BE NOW I HOPE YOU ARE HUNGRY EDWARD SAID CLARA DINNER IS ALMOST READY
THEY ARE WHOLLY UNSHACKLED FURTHER THAN THAT YOU ARE TO REPAY BY INSTALLMENTS THE MONEY EXPENDED IN THE BUILDING OF THE HOUSE THIS I AM EMPOWERED TO STATE TO YOU AND I THINK YOU WILL ALLOW THAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE
PATIENCE OBSERVED IT AND AFTER A TIME SAID YOU WILL BE ABLE TO WATCH OVER YOUR SISTERS MISTER ARMITAGE
HAS FULLY ACTED UP TO WHAT HE STATED WERE HIS VIEWS WHEN HE FIRST OBTAINED A GRANT OF THE PROPERTY HE HAS INDEED REPLIED EDWARD AS FOR HIS DAUGHTER EDWARD YOU HAVE YET TO WIN HER AND WEAR HER
I NOT LIKE TO STEAL BUT BECAUSE HUNGRY I STEAL NOW I NEVER HUNGRY ALWAYS HAVE PLENTY TO EAT NO ONE BEAT ME NOW SLEEP WARM ALL NIGHT WHY I STEAL THEN NO MASTER HUMPHREY I NEVER STEAL MORE
WHAT MUST HE THINK OF MY NOT HAVING CALLED UPON HIM NOTHING YOU HOLD A PLACE AT COURT YOU MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT HE WAS IN LONDON AS YOU HAVE NEVER MET HIM YOUR COMING WITH ME WILL MAKE IT APPEAR SO
CLAIMED BY AN ELDERLY RELATION WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTRY AND WHOSE INFIRM STATE OF HEALTH DID NOT PERMIT HIM TO QUIT THE HOUSE HE LEFT HIS PROPERTY TO CLARA ABOUT A YEAR AFTER HER MARRIAGE TO HUMPHREY
ALICE AND EDITH DID NOT QUITE SO MUCH APPROVE OF IT AND A FEW TEARS WERE SHED AT THE IDEA OF EDWARD LEAVING THE COTTAGE THE NEXT DAY EDWARD AND HUMPHREY SET OFF FOR LYMINGTON WITH BILLY IN THE CART DO YOU KNOW EDWARD SAID HUMPHREY
EXCEPT IN INQUIRING AFTER HER HEALTH AND SENDING HIS RESPECTS IT MAY BE YEARS BEFORE I SEE HER AGAIN THOUGHT EDWARD AND WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN
AND TIME AND ABSENCE HAVE THEIR EFFECT UPON THE MOST ARDENT OF LOVERS THE SIGHT OF HER SO RESPLENDENT IN BEAUTY ACTED UPON HIM LIKE MAGIC AND HE WAS UNEASY TILL THE CEREMONY WAS OVER AND HE WAS ENABLED TO GO TO HIS SISTERS
REPLIED EDWARD WE WILL DRIVE THERE FIRST AS I MUST ASK HIM TO RECOMMEND ME TO A TAILOR ON THEIR ARRIVAL AT LYMINGTON THEY WENT STRAIGHT TO THE HOSTELRY AND FOUND THE LANDLORD AT HOME HE RECOMMENDED A TAILOR TO EDWARD
BY THIS CONVERSATION IT WILL APPEAR TO THE READER THAT THEY HAD BEEN TRYING TO IMPRESS PABLO WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION AND SUCH WAS THE CASE EDITH HAVING BEEN ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE IN THE ENDEAVOR
WEALTHY INDEED REPLIED THE INTENDANT I HAD NO IDEA THAT POOR RATCLIFFE POSSESSED SO MUCH READY MONEY AND JEWELS WELL THEN THIS IS WEDNESDAY CAN YOU COME OVER NEXT MONDAY YES SIR REPLIED EDWARD
OH MY BUTTONS I WISH I COULD DRAW LIKE THAT I'M TO LEARN DRAWING THIS HALF I WONDER IF I SHALL LEARN TO MAKE DOGS AND DONKEYS OH YOU CAN DO THEM WITHOUT LEARNING SAID PHILIP I NEVER LEARNED DRAWING
STEPHEN WAS TOO WELL BRED NOT TO SEEM UNAWARE THAT THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION COULD HAVE BEEN FELT EMBARRASSING AND AT ONCE BEGAN TO TALK OF IMPERSONAL MATTERS ASKING LUCY IF SHE KNEW WHEN THE BAZAAR WAS AT LENGTH TO TAKE PLACE
AND AS HE DREW WAS THINKING WHAT HE COULD SAY TO TOM AND TRYING TO OVERCOME HIS OWN REPUGNANCE TO MAKING THE FIRST ADVANCES TOM BEGAN TO LOOK OFTENER AND LONGER AT PHILIP'S FACE
WHO SAW A VISTA IN THIS DIRECTION IS THERE ANYTHING LIKE DAVID AND GOLIATH AND SAMSON IN THE GREEK HISTORY THOSE ARE THE ONLY BITS I LIKE IN THE HISTORY OF THE JEWS OH THERE ARE VERY FINE STORIES OF THAT SORT ABOUT THE GREEKS
I CANNOT MARRY YOU I CANNOT TAKE A GOOD FOR MYSELF THAT HAS BEEN WRUNG OUT OF THEIR MISERY IT IS NOT THE FORCE THAT OUGHT TO RULE US THIS THAT WE FEEL FOR EACH OTHER IT WOULD REND ME AWAY FROM ALL THAT MY PAST LIFE HAS MADE DEAR AND HOLY TO ME
NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE A WELL KNOWN FIGURE COMING OUT OF THEM ON A FINE BLACK HORSE THEY MET ABOUT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE GATES
OBSERVING THAT GYPSIES WERE THIEVES AND HARDLY GOT ANYTHING TO EAT AND HAD NOTHING TO DRIVE BUT A DONKEY TO DAY HOWEVER MAGGIE THOUGHT HER MISERY HAD REACHED A PITCH AT WHICH GYPSYDOM WAS HER REFUGE
A TALLISH MAN WITH AN AQUILINE NOSE AND ABUNDANT IRON GRAY HAIR YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN MISTER WAKEM BEFORE AND ARE POSSIBLY WONDERING WHETHER HE WAS REALLY AS EMINENT A RASCAL AND AS CRAFTY BITTER AN ENEMY OF HONEST HUMANITY IN GENERAL AND OF MISTER TULLIVER IN PARTICULAR
THIS NEW EXPERIENCE WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO HER SO AGREEABLE THAT IT ALMOST EFFACED HER PREVIOUS EMOTION ABOUT PHILIP THERE WAS A NEW BRIGHTNESS IN HER EYES AND A VERY BECOMING FLUSH ON HER CHEEK AS SHE SEATED HERSELF
I SHOULD HAVE PRAYED FOR HELP SO EARNESTLY I SHOULD HAVE RUSHED AWAY AS WE RUSH FROM HIDEOUS DANGER I FEEL NO EXCUSE FOR MYSELF NONE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE FAILED TOWARD LUCY AND PHILIP AS I HAVE DONE IF I HAD NOT BEEN WEAK SELFISH AND HARD
AND ABOUT WILLIAM WALLACE AND ROBERT BRUCE AND JAMES DOUGLAS I KNOW NO END YOU'RE OLDER THAN I AM AREN'T YOU SAID TOM WHY HOW OLD ARE YOU I'M FIFTEEN
FOR IT WAS NOT THIS WAY THAT THEY CAME FROM DORLCOTE MILL TO GARUM FIRS AND SHE FELT ALL THE SAFER FOR THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HER BEING OVERTAKEN BUT SHE WAS SOON AWARE NOT WITHOUT TREMBLING
AND HE WAS NOT PREPARED TO SAY HOW DO YOU DO ON SO SHORT A NOTICE MISTER STELLING WISELY TURNED AWAY AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM BOYS SHYNESS ONLY WEARS OFF IN THE ABSENCE OF THEIR ELDERS
FORGIVE ME FOR WHAT I DID YESTERDAY I WILL OBEY YOU NOW I WILL DO NOTHING WITHOUT YOUR FULL CONSENT BUT DON'T BLIGHT OUR LIVES FOREVER BY A RASH PERVERSITY THAT CAN ANSWER NO GOOD PURPOSE TO ANY ONE THAT CAN ONLY CREATE NEW EVILS SIT DOWN DEAREST WAIT
AND YOU CAN BALANCE AND CHOOSE IN THAT WAY BUT YOU DON'T LOVE ME IF YOU HAD A TITHE OF THE FEELING FOR ME THAT I HAVE FOR YOU IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO YOU TO THINK FOR A MOMENT OF SACRIFICING ME BUT IT WEIGHS NOTHING WITH YOU THAT YOU ARE ROBBING ME OF MY LIFE'S HAPPINESS
BUT YOU'VE DONE WHAT YOU COULD TO MAKE THINGS A BIT EVEN SHAKE HANDS WI ME AGAIN MY LAD BEFORE I GO AWAY FROM YOU THE FATHER AND SON CLASPED HANDS
THAN THAT SHE BOTH IMPLICITLY BELIEVED WHAT STEPHEN SAID AND WAS DETERMINED THAT MAGGIE SHOULD NOT KNOW IT BUT YOU WHO HAVE A HIGHER LOGIC THAN THE VERBAL TO GUIDE YOU HAVE ALREADY FORESEEN AS THE DIRECT SEQUENCE TO THAT UNFAVORABLE OPINION OF STEPHEN'S
THAT THERE WERE TWO MEN COMING ALONG THE LANE IN FRONT OF HER SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF MEETING STRANGERS SHE HAD BEEN TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THE IDEA OF HER FRIENDS COMING AFTER HER THE FORMIDABLE STRANGERS WERE TWO SHABBY LOOKING MEN WITH FLUSHED FACES
TOM SHE SAID WHEN THEY WERE OUT OF THEIR FATHER'S ROOM TOGETHER WE MUST TRY TO MAKE FATHER UNDERSTAND A LITTLE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE HE GOES DOWNSTAIRS BUT WE MUST GET MY MOTHER AWAY SHE WILL SAY SOMETHING THAT WILL DO HARM
FROM THE KITCHEN AT THE BREAKFAST HOUR THE FAVORITE ANTHEM THE GREEN BOUGHS AND THE SHORT SERMON GAVE THE APPROPRIATE FESTAL CHARACTER TO THE CHURCH GOING AND AUNT AND UNCLE MOSS WITH ALL THEIR SEVEN CHILDREN
HIS HANDS MOVED UNEASILY AS IF HE WANTED THEM TO REMOVE SOME OBSTRUCTION THAT WEIGHED UPON HIM TWO OR THREE TIMES THERE FELL FROM HIM SOME BROKEN WORDS THIS WORLD'S TOO MANY HONEST MAN PUZZLING
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE PAST THAT CAN ANNUL OUR RIGHT TO EACH OTHER IT IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE EITHER OF US LOVED WITH OUR WHOLE HEART AND SOUL MAGGIE WAS STILL SILENT FOR A LITTLE WHILE LOOKING DOWN STEPHEN WAS IN A FLUTTER OF NEW HOPE
IT WOULD NOT HE ACKNOWLEDGED BE A BAD SPECULATION FOR GUEST AND CO TO BUY DORLCOTE MILL AND CARRY ON THE BUSINESS WHICH WAS A GOOD ONE AND MIGHT BE INCREASED BY THE ADDITION OF STEAM POWER IN WHICH CASE TULLIVER MIGHT BE RETAINED AS MANAGER
PHILIP WAS AT ONCE TOO PROUD AND TOO TIMID TO WALK TOWARD TOM HE THOUGHT OR RATHER FELT THAT TOM HAD AN AVERSION TO LOOKING AT HIM EVERY ONE ALMOST DISLIKED LOOKING AT HIM
IT WAS A COLD WET JANUARY DAY ON WHICH TOM WENT BACK TO SCHOOL A DAY QUITE IN KEEPING WITH THIS SEVERE PHASE OF HIS DESTINY IF HE HAD NOT CARRIED IN HIS POCKET A PARCEL OF SUGAR CANDY AND A SMALL DUTCH DOLL FOR LITTLE LAURA
AND HIS FATHER'S IRRITABLE TALK MADE HIM UNCOMFORTABLE THOUGH HE NEVER ACCOUNTED TO HIMSELF FOR THE FEELING OR CONCEIVED THE NOTION THAT HIS FATHER WAS FAULTY IN THIS RESPECT
BUT SOME SUBTLE INFLUENCE PREVENTED HIM FROM FORESEEING THE GOOD FORTUNE AS HAPPENING TO HIMSELF SHAKE HANDS WI ME MY LAD HE SAID SUDDENLY PUTTING OUT HIS HAND IT'S A GREAT THING WHEN A MAN CAN BE PROUD AS HE'S GOT A GOOD SON I'VE HAD THAT LUCK
AND THESE WORDS WHICH HE HAD USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO TOM WHEN HE WANTED TO DECLINE THE FULL PAYMENT OF HIS FIFTY POUNDS OUT OF THE CHILDREN'S MONEY WERE THE MOST READY TO HIS TONGUE THEY WERE JUST THE WORDS TO LAY THE MOST PAINFUL HOLD ON HIS MASTER'S BEWILDERED MIND
AND WAKEM'S ADVICE HAD NOT CARRIED HIM FAR NO DIX MISTER TULLIVER CONSIDERED HAD BEEN AS GOOD AS NOWHERE IN POINT OF LAW AND IN THE INTENSITY OF HIS INDIGNATION AGAINST PIVART HIS CONTEMPT FOR A BAFFLED ADVERSARY LIKE DIX
AS WELL AS IN HIS TABLE TALK FOR WAKEM WAS NOT A MERE MAN OF BUSINESS HE WAS CONSIDERED A PLEASANT FELLOW IN THE UPPER CIRCLES OF SAINT OGG'S CHATTED AMUSINGLY OVER HIS PORT WINE
I COULDN'T LIVE IN PEACE IF I PUT THE SHADOW OF A WILFUL SIN BETWEEN MYSELF AND GOD I HAVE CAUSED SORROW ALREADY I KNOW I FEEL IT BUT I HAVE NEVER DELIBERATELY CONSENTED TO IT I HAVE NEVER SAID THEY SHALL SUFFER THAT I MAY HAVE JOY
SHE SAID IN A VOICE ALMOST OF AGONY STEPHEN DON'T ASK ME DON'T URGE ME I CAN'T ARGUE ANY LONGER I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WISE BUT MY HEART WILL NOT LET ME DO IT I SEE I FEEL THEIR TROUBLE NOW IT IS AS IF IT WERE BRANDED ON MY MIND
LOOKING AT HIM WITH HER DIRECT GLANCE IF WE USE COMMON WORDS ON A GREAT OCCASION THEY ARE THE MORE STRIKING BECAUSE THEY ARE FELT AT ONCE TO HAVE A PARTICULAR MEANING LIKE OLD BANNERS OR EVERY DAY CLOTHES HUNG UP IN A SACRED PLACE
AND HE LEFT HIS DAUGHTERS BADLY OFF ONE OF THEM IS UNDER TEACHER AT MISS FIRNISS'S WHERE I'VE BEEN TO SCHOOL YOU KNOW AH SAID HER FATHER DOUBTFULLY STILL LOOKING IN HER FACE BUT AS SOON AS TOM BEGAN TO SPEAK HE TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM WITH THE SAME INQUIRING GLANCES
BY TALKING TO THEM AT EASE ON SUBJECTS OF WHICH THEY KNOW NOTHING STEPHEN BECAME QUITE BRILLIANT IN AN ACCOUNT OF BUCKLAND'S TREATISE WHICH HE HAD JUST BEEN READING
AND PERHAPS LUCY'S ANXIOUS PITYING QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POOR COUSINS HELPED TO MAKE UNCLE DEANE MORE PROMPT IN FINDING TOM A TEMPORARY PLACE IN THE WAREHOUSE AND IN PUTTING HIM IN THE WAY OF GETTING EVENING LESSONS IN BOOK KEEPING AND CALCULATION
THIS WORLD'S BEEN TOO MANY FOR ME IT'S TOOK FOUR YEAR TO LAY THIS BY IT'S MUCH IF I'M ABOVE GROUND FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEAR I MUST TRUSTEN TO YOU TO PAY EM HE WENT ON WITH A TREMBLING VOICE
FOR AT THE NEXT BEND IN THE LANE MAGGIE ACTUALLY SAW THE LITTLE SEMICIRCULAR BLACK TENT WITH THE BLUE SMOKE RISING BEFORE IT WHICH WAS TO BE HER REFUGE FROM ALL THE BLIGHTING OBLOQUY THAT HAD PURSUED HER IN CIVILIZED LIFE
THE WIFE AND CHILDREN WERE NOT WITHOUT HOPE OF AN ISSUE THAT WOULD AT LEAST SAVE MISTER TULLIVER FROM LEAVING THE OLD SPOT AND SEEKING AN ENTIRELY STRANGE LIFE FOR UNCLE DEANE HAD BEEN INDUCED TO INTEREST HIMSELF IN THIS STAGE OF THE BUSINESS
ALWAYS LOOKING SO SURE OF HIS GAME AND IT WAS VEXATIOUS THAT LAWYER GORE WAS NOT MORE LIKE HIM BUT WAS A BALD ROUND FEATURED MAN WITH BLAND MANNERS AND FAT HANDS A GAME COCK
BLUSHING WITH RETURNING SELF CONSCIOUSNESS AT THIS DIRECT ADDRESS AND TAKING UP HER WORK AGAIN NO NO LUCY INTERPOSED I MUST FORBID YOUR PLUNGING MAGGIE IN BOOKS I SHALL NEVER GET HER AWAY FROM THEM AND I WANT HER TO HAVE DELICIOUS DO NOTHING DAYS
HE HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE SUSPICION THAT WAKEM HAD MORE LAW TO SHOW AGAINST THIS RATIONALLY IRREFRAGABLE INFERENCE THAN GORE COULD SHOW FOR IT BUT THEN
FOR AT THOSE BIG DANCES SHE HAD OFTEN AND OFTEN DANCED WITH YOUNG MEN WHOSE NAMES SHE HAD FORGOTTEN MISSUS TULLIVER HID THESE REASONINGS IN HER OWN BOSOM FOR WHEN SHE HAD THROWN OUT A HINT TO MISTER DEANE AND MISTER GLEGG THAT SHE WOULDN'T MIND GOING TO SPEAK TO WAKEM HERSELF THEY HAD SAID
THAT DEMANDED A STRONG AND PROMPT REMEDY AND THE CONSULTATION AS TO WHAT WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO THIS END FROM AMONG THE SUPERFLUITIES OF MISSUS PULLET'S WARDROBE WAS ONE THAT LUCY AS WELL AS MISSUS TULLIVER ENTERED INTO WITH SOME ZEAL
NOW THE ONLY THING THAT THE KING MUCH CARED FOR IN HIS PALACE WAS THE QUEEN HERSELF AND AS SHE WAS WEEPING BITTERLY ON A PILE OF CUSHIONS IN THE GREAT HALL WHEN HE HAD RIDDEN AWAY
SO THE DRAKEN RETURNED TO THE SPRING AWOKE LAZARUS AND SAID THAT IF IT WAS AGREEABLE TO HIM THEY SHOULD MAKE FELLOWSHIP TOGETHER LAZARUS ANSWERED THAT HE WAS WILLING
WHILE HIS MOTHER HUNG ROUND HIS NECK A CROSS OF GOLD SO KISSING HIM TENDERLY WITH MANY TEARS THEY LET HIM GO HE RODE STEADILY ON FOR THREE DAYS AND AT SUNSET ON THE FOURTH DAY
RABBIT YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN AN IDIOT TO HAVE LET THE JACKAL DRINK OUR WATER WHEN HE WOULD NOT HELP TO FIND IT WHO SHALL BE OUR NEXT WATCHMAN WE MUST HAVE SOMEBODY A LITTLE SHARPER THAN YOU AND THE LITTLE HARE CALLED OUT
AND THE SISTER ATE THE CHERRIES AND DECLARED HERSELF WELL AGAIN THE NEXT DAY WHEN JANNI WAS GONE TO HUNT THE DRAKOS CAME OUT AND ADVISED THE SISTER THAT SHE SHOULD PRETEND TO BE ILL AGAIN
THREE HEADS WHEN HE COMPLAINED OF COLD THE BLACKSMITH TOLD HIM TO SIT NEAR THE FIRE AND WHEN HE SAID HE WAS HUNGRY THE BLACKSMITH PUT SOME FOOD ON A PLATE AND GAVE IT TO HIM THE DWARF MADE SHORT WORK OF WHAT WAS PROVIDED FOR HIM
AND WHEN THESE THREE HAD BEEN WORRIED BY THE DOGS THERE CAME THREE OTHERS WHO WERE WORRIED IN LIKE MANNER THEN THE DOGS AGAIN DUG A GRAVE AND BURIED THE DEAD DRAKEN THAT THEIR MASTER MIGHT NOT SEE THEM
SO HE CHEERFULLY GAVE THE PROMISE ASKED FOR BY THE UGLY LITTLE MAN AND IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE MAN SPRING AND CUP HAD DISAPPEARED AND THE KING WAS LEFT KNEELING ON THE DRY SAND
ALL THAT DAY THINGS WENT ON EXACTLY AS THEY HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE AFTER SUPPER THE WIZARD BROUGHT BACK THE PRINCESS AND LOOKING HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYES HE SAID WE SHALL SEE WHICH OF US TWO WILL GAIN THE PRIZE AFTER ALL
THE OLD MAN LISTENED TO HIM FULL OF SORROW AND THEN HE SPOKE YOU HAVE DONE ILL MY SON TO SEARCH OUT THAT WHICH WAS HIDDEN AND YOU ARE RUNNING TO MEET A GREAT DANGER THIS YOUNG GIRL HAS FALLEN INTO THE POWER OF A WICKED SORCERER WHO LIVES IN AN IRON CASTLE
A HORSE A HORSE CRIED THE KING I WILL GO AFTER THEM MYSELF THIS TIME THEY SHALL NOT ESCAPE AND HE GALLOPED OFF FOAMING WITH ANGER I THINK I HEAR SOMEONE PURSUING US SAID THE PRINCESS YES SO DO I
THE LOT OF REMAINING AT HOME FELL FIRST TO THE NUN AND WHEN THE COUNTRYMAN AND THE BLACKSMITH HAD GONE OUT INTO THE WOOD SHE SET TO WORK TIDIED UP THE HOUSE AND PREPARED ALL THE FOOD FOR THE DAY
UNKNOWN TO JANNI THEY GOT MARRIED THEN WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE THE SISTER REPENTED AND WAS AFRAID OF JANNI'S WRATH WHEN HE FOUND IT OUT ONE DAY THE DRAKOS CAME TO HER AND SAID
HE SEATED HIMSELF BY HER AND DETERMINED NOT TO CLOSE HIS EYES THAT NIGHT FOR FEAR SHE SHOULD ESCAPE HIM AND IN ORDER THAT SHE SHOULD BE DOUBLY GUARDED LONG STRETCHED HIMSELF LIKE A STRAP ALL ROUND THE ROOM
AND THEN RETURNING TO HIS ROOM SET HIMSELF TO THINK ABOUT THE CERTAIN DEATH THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS QUITE ABSORBED IN THESE THOUGHTS WHEN SUDDENLY A BEE FLEW AGAINST THE WINDOW AND TAPPED SAYING LET ME COME IN
AND LEFT THE POOR FELLOW MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE NOW WHEN THE BLACKSMITH CAME HOME WITH THE NUN IN THE EVENING AND FOUND NOTHING FOR SUPPER
AND SAID THAT IF HE WOULD LIKE TO GO AND VISIT THEM THEY WOULD GIVE HIM A BAG OF GOLD TO TAKE AWAY WITH HIM HE AGREED WILLINGLY TO THIS BUT ASKED FURTHER THAT ONE OF THE DRAKEN SHOULD GO WITH HIM TO CARRY THE BAG OF GOLD THEY CONSENTED AND ONE WAS SENT WITH HIM
GOOD MORNING TORTOISE GOOD MORNING BUT THE TORTOISE TOOK NO NOTICE GOOD MORNING TORTOISE GOOD MORNING BUT STILL THE TORTOISE PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR THEN THE JACKAL SAID TO HIMSELF
WHEN THEY HAD BROUGHT HIM THERE HE SENT TO BEG THE PRINCESS TO COME TO HIM BUT SHE DID NOT RECOGNISE HIM TILL HE HAD SHOWN HER THE RING SHE HAD GIVEN HIM THEN SHE REMEMBERED HIM AND TOOK HIM WITH HER INTO THE CASTLE
AND SURE ENOUGH IN LESS TIME THAN IT TAKES TO WALK ROUND A COTTAGE THEY HAD RETURNED FROM THE FOREST AND LONG PRESENTED THE ACORN TO THE PRINCE NOW YOUR EXCELLENCY THROW IT ON THE GROUND THE PRINCE OBEYED AND WAS ENCHANTED TO SEE THE PRINCESS APPEAR AT HIS SIDE
WHEN SHE LEARNT WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM SHE CALLED TOGETHER ALL THE SORCERESSES IN THE COUNTRY IN ORDER THAT THEY SHOULD TELL HER WHERE THE EYES WERE AT LAST SHE FOUND ONE WHO DECLARED THAT SHE KNEW WHERE THEY WERE AND THAT SHE COULD RESTORE THEM
PULLING OUT OF IT A PIECE OF HONEYCOMB HE LICKED HIS LIPS AND EXCLAIMED OH LITTLE HARE
AND PUT ON THE DRESSES STRUCK THE SAND WITH THEIR FEET AND WERE TRANSFORMED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE INTO ELEVEN BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRLS WHO FLEW AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD THE TWELFTH AND YOUNGEST REMAINED IN THE WATER
A LONG TIME AGO THERE LIVED A KING AND QUEEN WHO HAD NO CHILDREN ALTHOUGH THEY BOTH WISHED VERY MUCH FOR A LITTLE SON THEY TRIED NOT TO LET EACH OTHER SEE HOW UNHAPPY THEY WERE
AFTER SOME TALK IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE RABBIT SHOULD BE LEFT IN CHARGE THEN ALL THE OTHER BEASTS WENT BACK TO THEIR HOMES
AGAIN THE DRAKEN SENT ONE OF THEM AFTER HIM TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIM AND WHEN THIS ONE ASKED WHAT HE WAS ABOUT LAZARUS ANSWERED I WILL BRING THE ENTIRE FOREST HOME AT ONCE SO THAT AFTER THAT WE MAY HAVE REST
AND THAT NO ONE SHOULD GO SUPPERLESS TO BED WHEN DAY DAWNED THE COUNTRYMAN AND THE NUN SET OUT INTO THE WOOD AND THE BLACKSMITH PREPARED ALL THE FOOD FOR THE DAY AS THE OTHERS HAD DONE AGAIN THE GRAY DWARF ENTERED THE HOUSE WITHOUT KNOCKING AND THIS TIME HE HAD
AND PRETENDED TO TAKE PLEASURE IN HUNTING AND HAWKING AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER SPORTS BUT AT LENGTH THE KING COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER AND DECLARED THAT HE MUST GO AND VISIT THE FURTHEST CORNERS OF HIS KINGDOM
THEN THE SISTER DID AS THE DRAKOS ADVISED AND NEXT DAY JANNI SET OUT TO FETCH THE CHERRIES TAKING HIS THREE DOGS WITH HIM WHEN HE CAME TO THE GARDEN WHERE THE CHERRIES GREW HE JUMPED OFF HIS HORSE
THE PRINCE PUT UP HIS HORSE IN THE STABLE WHERE EVERYTHING LOOKED AS IF A GUEST WAS EXPECTED AND THEN THE WHOLE PARTY MARCHED STRAIGHT UP TO THE CASTLE
AND LET YOU BE FREE AND THEN THE DRAKEN TORE UP ONE TREE THREW IT OVER HIS SHOULDER AND SO CARRIED IT HOME WHEN THEY HAD LIVED TOGETHER SOME TIME THE DRAKEN BECAME WEARY OF LAZARUS AND AGREED AMONG THEMSELVES TO KILL HIM
ALL FOUR DETERMINED THAT THIS TIME THEY WOULD KEEP AWAKE AT ANY COST BUT IT WAS NO USE OFF THEY WENT AS THEY HAD DONE BEFORE AND WHEN THE PRINCE AWOKE THE NEXT MORNING THE ROOM WAS AGAIN EMPTY WITH A PANG OF SHAME HE RUSHED TO FIND QUICKEYE
SOON AFTER THE DWARF LOOKED GREEDILY ROUND AND SAID OH
AND SCRATCHED A GRAVE IN THE GROUND WITH THEIR PAWS AND BURIED THE DRAKEN SO THAT JANNI MIGHT NOT SEE THEIR DEAD BODIES WHEN JANNI AWOKE AND SAW HIS DOGS ALL COVERED WITH BLOOD HE BELIEVED THAT THEY HAD CAUGHT SOMEWHERE A WILD BEAST
SHE BEGGED HIM TO TELL HER WHEREIN LAY HIS STRENGTH AND HE ANSWERED IT LIES IN MY TWO FINGERS IF THESE ARE BOUND TOGETHER THEN ALL MY STRENGTH DISAPPEARS THAT I WILL NOT BELIEVE SAID THE SISTER
I AM SO SORRY BUT I HAVE NONE ANSWERED THE LITTLE HARE
AND EVERY DAY WENT OUT TO HUNT WITH THE WEAPONS THE DRAKEN HAD LEFT IN THE CASTLE ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS AWAY HUNTING ONE OF THE DRAKEN CAME UP TO GET PROVISIONS NOT KNOWING THAT THERE WAS ANYONE IN THE CASTLE
AND THIS SHE GAVE TO HER BROTHER THEN THEY WENT ON THEIR WAY TAKING WITH THEM THE THREE SHEEP WHICH WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THEIR FLOCKS AFTER WANDERING FOR THREE DAYS THEY MET A MAN WITH THREE DOGS
WHEN THE WIZARD CAME HIS EYES SHOT FORTH FLAMES OF FURY CRIC CRAC WAS HEARD AND ANOTHER OF HIS IRON BANDS BROKE AND FELL HE SEIZED THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND AND LED HER OFF GROWLING LOUDER THAN EVER
AND YOU BRING ME ONLY ONE WHEN THE DRAKEN HEARD THAT HE MADE OFF TO THE RIGHTABOUT AT ONCE AND RAN SO FAST THAT THE FOX WAS DASHED IN PIECES AGAINST THE STONES
AS THE PRINCE LOOKED AT THEM HE WAS AMAZED AT THEIR LIKENESS TWICE HE WALKED ALONG THE LINE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DETECT THE SIGN AGREED UPON
AND WERE FEELING QUITE HAPPY WHEN SUDDENLY THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF A GALLOP FAR BEHIND THEM THE PRINCE SPRANG FROM THE SADDLE AND LAID HIS EAR TO THE GROUND THEY ARE PURSUING US HE SAID THEN THERE IS NO TIME TO BE LOST ANSWERED THE PRINCESS
THIS IS OUR THIRD COMRADE YOU WILL DO WELL TO TAKE HIM INTO YOUR SERVICE AND I ASSURE YOU YOU WILL FIND HIM WORTH HIS SALT WHO ARE YOU ASKED THE PRINCE AND WHY ARE YOUR EYES BANDAGED YOU CAN NEVER SEE YOUR WAY
AND WHAT MIGHT YOU HAVE BEEN UP TO HE INQUIRED COLDLY THIS MAN SAYS YOU HIT HIM PSMITH WAVED THE MATTER ASIDE PURELY IN SELF DEFENCE HE SAID PURELY IN SELF DEFENCE WHAT ELSE COULD THE MAN OF SPIRIT DO
SAID PSMITH PERHAPS YOU ARE WISE IN A WORD THEN HE PICKED UP THE BRANDY AND HELD IT OUT TO HIM
HOW PLEASANT HE SAID AFTER STRIFE IS REST WE SHOULDN'T HAVE APPRECIATED THIS SIMPLE CUP OF TEA HAD OUR SENSIBILITIES REMAINED UNSTIRRED THIS AFTERNOON
I SHOULD LIKE TO EXCESSIVELY SAID PSMITH EXCELLENT BRING JACKSON WITH YOU AND BOTH OF YOU COME TO SUPPER AFTERWARDS IF YOU WILL THANKS VERY MUCH PERHAPS YOU WOULD SPEAK YOURSELF
THE THING MUST STOP YOUR SECRETARIAL DUTIES MUST BE PARAMOUNT NOTHING MUST BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH THEM YES THE THING MUST STOP BEFORE IT GOES TOO FAR IT SEEMS TO ME SAID MIKE THAT IT HAS GONE TOO FAR I'VE GOT THE SACK
MIKE LOOKED UP WHAT YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU'RE GOING TO SWEAT OUT TO CLAPHAM AGAIN UNDOUBTEDLY COMRADE WALLER IS EXPECTING US TO SUPPER WHAT ABSOLUTE ROT WE CAN'T FAG BACK THERE NOBLESSE OBLIGE
HE REMOVED HIS HAT
COULD BE SPUN OUT FROM HALF PAST TWELVE TO TWO MORE WORK FROM TWO TILL HALF PAST THREE FROM HALF PAST THREE TILL HALF PAST FOUR TEA IN THE TEAROOM WITH A NOVEL
NOBODY WILL TAKE AN OLD MAN LIKE ME HIS VOICE DIED AWAY THERE WAS A SILENCE MIKE SAT STARING MISERABLY IN FRONT OF HIM THEN QUITE SUDDENLY AN IDEA CAME TO HIM
I WENT TALKING ON LAUGHING AND JOKING WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE FLEW OUT AT ME
NO I PREFER TO THINK THAT COMRADE BICKERSDYKE REGARDS ME AS HIS FRIEND AND WELL WISHER AND WILL LEND A COURTEOUS EAR TO ANY PROPOSAL I SEE FIT TO MAKE I HOPE SHORTLY TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THIS TO YOU
THE CRY HAS GONE ROUND THE WALLER HOUSEHOLD JACKSON AND PSMITH ARE COMING TO SUPPER AND WE CANNOT DISAPPOINT THEM NOW ALREADY THE FATTED BLANC MANGE HAS BEEN KILLED AND THE TABLE CREAKS BENEATH WHAT'S LEFT OF THE MIDDAY BEEF
THE WORK WAS EASY AND WHEN HE DID HAPPEN TO MAKE MISTAKES THEY WERE CORRECTED PATIENTLY BY THE GREY BEARDED ONE AND NOT USED AS LEVERS FOR BOOSTING HIM INTO THE PRESENCE OF MISTER BICKERSDYKE AS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN SOME DEPARTMENTS THE CASHIER SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN A FANCY TO MIKE
ONE CANNOT EXPLAIN THESE THINGS IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME INCOMPATIBILITY OF TEMPERAMENT PERHAPS HE WILL MANAGE TO BEAR UP AT MY DEPARTURE BUT HERE WE ARE HE ADDED AS THE CAB DREW UP
SUNDAY SUPPER THE CAB TOOK THEM BACK TO THE FLAT AT CONSIDERABLE EXPENSE AND PSMITH REQUESTED MIKE TO MAKE TEA A PERFORMANCE IN WHICH HE HIMSELF WAS INTERESTED PURELY AS A SPECTATOR
THEY PASSED THROUGH THE TURNSTILE AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE TELEGRAPH BOARD
THERE WERE FOUR PEOPLE PRESENT COMRADE PREBBLE THE ORATOR A YOUNG MAN OF THE NAME OF RICHARDS MISTER WALLER'S NIECE
CERTAINLY MY BOY SAID MISTER SMITH SENIOR
THE TWO FELL IN A HEAP BILL UNDERNEATH AT THE SAME TIME BILL'S FRIENDS JOINED IN THE FIRST INTIMATION MIKE HAD OF THIS WAS A VIOLENT BLOW ACROSS THE SHOULDERS WITH A WALKING STICK EVEN IF HE HAD BEEN WEARING HIS OVERCOAT THE BLOW WOULD HAVE HURT
EITHER A LITTLE MORE WORK OR MORE POTTERING ACCORDING TO WHETHER THERE WAS ANY WORK TO DO OR NOT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN UNPLEASANT MODE OF SPENDING A LATE JANUARY DAY THEN THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS AN INTERESTING LITTLE COMMUNITY THAT OF THE NEW ASIATIC BANK
I TRY WORK BUT THAT IS NO GOOD EITHER FROM LEDGER TO LEDGER THEY HURRY ME TO STIFLE MY REGRET AND WHEN THEY WIN A SMILE FROM ME THEY THINK THAT I FORGET BUT I DON'T I AM A BROKEN MAN
PITYINGLY THROUGH HIS EYEGLASS MIKE WHO FELT EMBARRASSED TOOK A SEAT SOME LITTLE WAY BEHIND HIS COMPANION THIS WAS PSMITH'S AFFAIR AND HE PROPOSED TO ALLOW HIM TO DO THE TALKING
BUT EARNEST YOUR VERY LUCID COMRADE PREBBLE BEAMED AND TOOK THE FLOOR MIKE BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT TILL NOW HE HAD NEVER KNOWN WHAT BOREDOM MEANT THERE HAD BEEN MOMENTS IN HIS LIFE WHICH HAD BEEN LESS INTERESTING THAN OTHER MOMENTS
THE OLD ETONIAN GREETED HIM WITH THE FAINT SMILE OF A PERSECUTED SAINT WHO IS DETERMINED TO BE CHEERFUL EVEN AT THE STAKE COMRADE BRISTOW HE SAID
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING TIRED OF IT NOT PRECISELY TIRED BUT
FALL OUT OVER SOME POINT PROBABLY OF THE MOST TRIVIAL NATURE AND WHAT HAPPENS THEY BRAWL THEY HE IT ME SAID THE LONG YOUTH DABBING AT HIS FACE WITH A HANDKERCHIEF
PSMITH AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TABLE BEAMED IN A FATHERLY MANNER UPON THE PAIR THROUGH HIS EYEGLASS MIKE GOT ON WITH SMALL GIRLS REASONABLY WELL HE PREFERRED THEM AT A DISTANCE BUT IF CORNERED BY THEM COULD PUT UP A FAIRLY GOOD SHOW SMALL BOYS HOWEVER FILLED HIM WITH A SORT OF FROZEN HORROR
A BRAINY AND ADMIRABLE STEP SAID PSMITH APPROVINGLY THIS RUGGED HONEST MAN ALL UNUSED TO VERBAL SUBTLETIES SHALL GIVE US HIS PLAIN ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAPPENED AFTER WHICH AS I PRESUME THIS TRAM LITTLE AS I KNOW OF THE HABITS OF TRAMS
COMRADE B HAD TO LAY IT ON REGARDLESS OF EXPENSE IN AMERICA AS POSSIBLY YOU ARE AWARE THERE IS A REGULAR POST OF MISTAKE CLERK WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO RECEIVE IN THE NECK ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO BE COMING ALONG WHEN CUSTOMERS MAKE COMPLAINTS HE IS HAULED INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE FOAMING CUSTOMER
AND PARTLY ON A WINDMILL HIS HEAD HE APPEARED TO BE TRYING TO CONCEAL BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS AND HE WHIRLED HIS ARMS ALTERNATELY IN CIRCULAR SWEEPS MIKE ON THE OTHER HAND STOOD UPRIGHT AND HIT STRAIGHT
THE SITUATION WAS TICKLING HIM MISTER WALLER HAS TOLD ME HE BEGAN I HAVE ALREADY SEEN MISTER WALLER I KNOW HE TOLD ME ABOUT THE CHEQUE I CAME TO EXPLAIN EXPLAIN YES
IN THAT THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF CROSS COUNTER WORK PEOPLE CAME IN FAIRLY FREQUENTLY TO CASH CHEQUES OF TWO OR THREE POUNDS BUT IT WAS RARE THAT ANY VERY LARGE DEALINGS TOOK PLACE HAVING COMPLETED HIS BUSINESS WITH THE INWARD BILLS
HULLO SMITHY SAID THE OTHER TURNING PSMITH SADLY DIRECTED MISTER WALLER'S ATTENTION TO THE WAISTCOAT WHICH WAS CERTAINLY DEFINITE IN ITS COLOURING NOTHING SAID PSMITH I ONLY WANTED TO LOOK AT YOU
WALLER WAS UP ALL NIGHT HE OUGHTN'T TO BE HERE AT ALL TODAY HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING HALF THE TIME HE'S ABSOLUTELY FAGGED OUT LOOK HERE YOU'D BETTER NIP BACK AND DO AS MUCH OF THE WORK AS YOU CAN I SHOULDN'T TALK TO HIM MUCH IF I WERE YOU BUCK ALONG MIKE WENT
IT IS TOO TRUE SAID PSMITH I MUST CORRECT MYSELF OF THE HABIT HE WILL BE GETTING ABOVE HIMSELF AND WHEN YOU WERE SPEAKING TO JACKSON YOU SPOKE OF YOURSELF AS A SOCIALIST SOCIALISM IS THE PASSION OF MY LIFE SAID PSMITH
BILL HAVING RECEIVED A SECOND BLOW IN THE EYE DURING THE COURSE OF HIS INTERVIEW ON THE ROAD WITH MIKE WAS NOT FEELING HIMSELF MISTAKING THE OTHER FOR AN ENEMY HE PROCEEDED TO SMITE HIM IN THE PARTS ABOUT THE JAW HE HAD JUST UPSET HIM WHEN A STERN OFFICIAL VOICE OBSERVED ERE NOW
PSMITH MAKES A DISCOVERY WOMEN SAID PSMITH HELPING HIMSELF TO TRIFLE AND SPEAKING WITH THE AIR OF ONE LAUNCHED UPON HIS SPECIAL SUBJECT ARE ONE MUST RECOLLECT LIKE
MISTER WALLER STILL CHIRPY HAD NOTHING BUT GOOD NEWS OF EDWARD MIKE WENT FOR HIS MORNING STROLL ROUND THE OFFICE FEELING THAT THINGS HAD SETTLED DOWN AND HAD MADE UP THEIR MIND TO RUN SMOOTHLY WHEN HE GOT BACK BARELY HALF AN HOUR LATER THE STORM HAD BURST
MISTER WALLER'S FACE HAD THE UNREASONABLE EFFECT ON HIM OF MAKING HIM FEEL SHY AND AWKWARD
MISTER WALLER'S FACE GREW ANIMATED HE STAMMERED IN HIS EAGERNESS I AM DELIGHTED HE SAID REALLY I AM DELIGHTED I ALSO A FELLOW WORKER IN THE CAUSE SAID PSMITH ER EXACTLY PSMITH EXTENDED HIS HAND GRAVELY
MISTER WALLER SHOOK IT WITH ENTHUSIASM I HAVE NEVER LIKED TO SPEAK OF IT TO ANYBODY IN THE OFFICE SAID MISTER WALLER BUT I TOO AM HEART AND SOUL IN THE MOVEMENT YOURS FOR THE REVOLUTION SAID PSMITH JUST SO JUST SO EXACTLY
URGED PSMITH SYMPATHETICALLY HOLDING OUT THE GLASS BE BRAVE HE WENT ON RAPIDLY TIME SOFTENS THE HARSHEST BLOWS
IT GENERALLY HAPPENED THAT HE HAD TO DO SO ONCE OR TWICE A DAY STRICTLY SPEAKING PERHAPS MISTER WALLER WAS WRONG TO LEAVE SUCH AN IMPORTANT TASK AS THE ACTUAL CASHING OF CHEQUES TO AN INEXPERIENCED PERSON OF MIKE'S STANDING BUT THE NEW ASIATIC BANK DIFFERED FROM MOST BANKS
OH IT'S HARD I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT ON ANY OTHER DAY BUT THAT I COULD NOT HAVE MISSED IT THEY SHOWED ME THE CHEQUE IN THERE JUST NOW I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I HAD PASSED IT I DON'T REMEMBER DOING IT MY MIND WAS FAR AWAY I DON'T REMEMBER THE CHEQUE OR ANYTHING ABOUT IT
WHO REGARDED HIM THROUGH HIS EYEGLASS WITH A LOOK IN WHICH PITY AND CENSURE WERE NICELY BLENDED BILL MEANWHILE CIRCLING ROUND RESTLESSLY IN THE APPARENT HOPE OF GETTING PAST THE LAW AND HAVING ANOTHER ENCOUNTER WITH MIKE
MY TIME FROM NOW ONWARD IS HIS HE SHALL HAVE THE FULL EDUCATIVE VALUE OF MY EXCLUSIVE ATTENTION I GIVE COMRADE BRISTOW UP MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE CORNER FLAG YOU UNDERSTAND HE ADDED AS MISTER ROSSITER EMERGED FROM HIS LAIR
MISTER RICHARDS PINK BUT DOGGED LOOSENED HIS COLLAR BUT SAID NOTHING PSMITH LEANING FORWARD ASKED MASTER EDWARD WALLER HIS OPINION ON THE LICENSING BILL WE HAPPENED TO HAVE A WORD OR TWO SAID MISTER RICHARDS AT LENGTH
THE DEPARTMENT INTO WHICH MIKE WAS SENT WAS THE CASH OR TO BE MORE EXACT THAT SECTION OF IT WHICH WAS KNOWN AS PAYING CASHIER
HE SIMPLY HAD NOT THE ABILITY TO BE AT HIS EASE WITH PEOPLE IN ANOTHER CLASS FROM HIS OWN HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT UNLESS THEY WERE CRICKET PROFESSIONALS
HAS NO INK BLACK ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE THE FURY OF THE IROQUOIS
IN SOME OF THE VILLAGES THERE WERE DWELLINGS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET LONG THOUGH IN BREADTH AND HEIGHT THEY DID NOT MUCH EXCEED THE OTHERS BREBEUF
THE GUNS AND TOMAHAWKS OF THE IROQUOIS WERE THE RUIN OF THEIR HOPES COULD THEY HAVE CURBED OR CONVERTED THOSE FEROCIOUS BANDS IT IS LITTLE LESS THAN CERTAIN
AND THAT THEY SHOULD EXCHANGE THEIR MISERIES FOR A LIFE OF PEACE AND PLENTY IN A FERTILE AND PROSPEROUS LAND THE WHOLE HURON POPULATION FULL OF JOYFUL EXCITEMENT CROWDED ABOUT HIM AND THE THREE ENVOYS WHO WERE CONDUCTED TO THE PRINCIPAL LODGE AND FEASTED
AND MADE THEM A PREY TO MISERY TORTURE AND A CRUEL DEATH IN A WORD THEY ARE A PEOPLE SWEPT FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH OUR ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT AS THEY DIED CHRISTIANS
THE YOUNG GIRLS ON FESTAL OCCASIONS MUST BE EXCEPTED FROM THIS COMMENDATION AS THEY WORE MERELY A KILT FROM THE WAIST TO THE KNEE BESIDES THE WAMPUM DECORATIONS OF THE BREAST AND ARMS THEIR LONG BLACK HAIR
NOTHING REMAINING OF THE ALGONQUINS WHO DWELT ON ITS SHORE EXCEPT THE ASHES OF THEIR BURNT WIGWAMS A LITTLE FARTHER ON THERE WAS A FORT BUILT OF TREES WHERE THE IROQUOIS WHO MADE THIS DESOLATION HAD SPENT THE WINTER
THAT THEY MADE US THEIR HEIRS KNOWING WELL THAT THEY WERE NEAR THEIR END AND IN FACT ONLY A FEW DAYS PASSED BEFORE WE HEARD OF THE DISASTER WHICH WE HAD FORESEEN THESE POOR PEOPLE FELL INTO AMBUSCADES OF OUR IROQUOIS ENEMIES
NOT LONG AFTER HE CAME TO CANADA AND WITH A VIEW AS IT WAS THOUGHT TO SOME FURTHER TREACHERY REJOINED THE FRENCH A SHARP CROSS QUESTIONING PUT HIM TO CONFUSION
WERE ALWAYS PRECEDED BY FEASTING
BY THE PRIMITIVE PROCESS OF ROLLING IT ON THEIR THIGHS AND OF THIS TWINE THEY MADE NETS THEY EXTRACTED OIL FROM FISH AND FROM THE SEEDS OF THE SUNFLOWER THE LATTER APPARENTLY ONLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE TOILET
AND OVER ROCKS AND PRECIPICES ON THE TENTH OF MAY THEY MADE TWO SUCH PORTAGES AND SOON AFTER REACHING A THIRD FALL AGAIN LIFTED THEIR CANOE FROM THE WATER THEY TOILED THROUGH THE NAKED FOREST AMONG THE WET BLACK TREES OVER TANGLED ROOTS
DO NOT WAIT TILL WAR AND FAMINE HAVE DESTROYED US TO THE LAST MAN WE ARE IN YOUR HANDS DEATH HAS TAKEN FROM YOU MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND OF US IF YOU WAIT LONGER NOT ONE WILL REMAIN ALIVE AND THEN YOU WILL BE SORRY THAT YOU DID NOT SAVE THOSE
THE HURONS HAD HOWEVER IN COMMON WITH OTHER TRIBES A SYSTEM OF RUDE PICTURES AND ARBITRARY SIGNS BY WHICH THEY COULD CONVEY TO EACH OTHER WITH TOLERABLE PRECISION INFORMATION TOUCHING THE ORDINARY SUBJECTS OF INDIAN INTEREST
AND PROMISED TO CHANGE THEIR NATIONALITY AND TURN SENECAS AS THE PRICE OF THEIR LIVES THE VICTORS ACCEPTED THE PROPOSAL AND THE INHABITANTS OF THESE TWO TOWNS JOINED BY A FEW OTHER HURONS
THE RIVER SEVERN AND LAKE SIMCOE ITS AREA WAS SMALL
ON THE BEST THAT THE VILLAGE COULD SUPPLY ETIENNE SEIZED THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ASIDE FOUR OR FIVE OF THE PRINCIPAL CHIEFS AND SECRETLY TELL THEM HIS SUSPICIONS THAT THE IROQUOIS WERE PLOTTING
NORTH AND SOUTH TRIBE WAS GIVING PLACE TO TRIBE LANGUAGE TO LANGUAGE FOR THE INDIAN HOPELESSLY UNCHANGING IN RESPECT TO INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT WAS AS REGARDED TRIBAL RELATIONS AND LOCAL HAUNTS
WHOSE LIFE IS DESCRIBED AS A SUCCESSION OF CONFLICTS AND ADVENTURES AND WHO IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN ALWAYS IN LUCK LANDED WITH A FEW COMPANIONS AND FELL INTO AN AMBUSCADE OF THE IROQUOIS
THE HURONS WERE EQUALLED OR SURPASSED BY SOME OF THE ALGONQUIN TRIBES THEY WORE THEIR HAIR AFTER A VARIETY OF GROTESQUE AND STARTLING FASHIONS WITH SOME IT WAS LOOSE ON ONE SIDE AND TIGHT BRAIDED ON THE OTHER WITH OTHERS
ABUNDANCE OF FISH AND GAME AND A PROSPEROUS TRADE WITH ALLIED NATIONS BESIDES THEY WERE THE TERROR OF THEIR ENEMIES BUT SINCE THEY HAVE EMBRACED THE FAITH AND ADORED THE CROSS OF CHRIST HE HAS GIVEN THEM A HEAVY SHARE IN THIS CROSS
MUTABLE AS THE WIND IN CANADA AND THE NORTHERN SECTION OF THE UNITED STATES THE ELEMENTS OF CHANGE WERE ESPECIALLY ACTIVE THE INDIAN POPULATION WHICH IN FIFTEEN THIRTY FIVE CARTIER FOUND AT MONTREAL AND QUEBEC
BUT HE REPLIED THAT THERE WERE OLDER AND WISER MEN AMONG THE HURONS WHOSE COUNSELS ALL THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED AND THAT THEY OUGHT TO LAY THE PROPOSAL BEFORE THEM HE PROCEEDED TO ADVISE THEM TO KEEP HIM AS A HOSTAGE AND SEND OVER HIS COMPANIONS WITH SOME OF THEIR CHIEFS
GREEN SPONGY MOSSES MOULDERING LEAVES AND ROTTEN PROSTRATE TRUNKS WHILE THE CATARACT FOAMED AMIDST THE ROCKS HARD BY THE INDIAN LED THE WAY WITH THE CANOE ON HIS HEAD WHILE BUTEUX AND THE OTHER FRENCHMAN FOLLOWED WITH THE BAGGAGE
ADDS THE FATHER SUPERIOR THAT HUNGER WILL DRIVE WOLVES FROM THE FOREST SO TOO OUR STARVING HURONS WERE DRIVEN OUT OF A TOWN WHICH HAD BECOME AN ABODE OF HORROR IT WAS THE END OF LENT
THIRTY ONE CHAMPLAIN SAYS THAT HE SAW THEM IN SIXTEEN FIFTEEN MORE THAN THIRTY FATHOMS LONG WHILE VANDERDONCK REPORTS THE LENGTH FROM ACTUAL MEASUREMENT OF AN IROQUOIS HOUSE AT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY YARDS
TO ONE OR MORE OLD MEN OF THE NATION WAS ASSIGNED THE HONORABLE BUT VERY ONEROUS CHARGE OF KEEPERS OF THE WAMPUM IN OTHER WORDS OF THE NATIONAL RECORDS AND IT WAS FOR THEM TO REMEMBER AND INTERPRET THE MEANING OF THE BELTS
A DITCH SEVERAL FEET DEEP WAS DUG AROUND THE VILLAGE AND THE EARTH THROWN UP ON THE INSIDE TREES WERE THEN FELLED BY AN ALTERNATE PROCESS OF BURNING AND HACKING THE BURNT PART WITH STONE HATCHETS
OR FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET IN SHAPE THEY WERE MUCH LIKE AN ARBOR OVERARCHING A GARDEN WALK THEIR FRAME WAS OF TALL AND STRONG SAPLINGS PLANTED IN A DOUBLE ROW TO FORM THE TWO SIDES OF THE HOUSE
THE IROQUOIS IN THE ABSENCE OF THE BIRCH WERE FORCED TO USE THE BARK OF THE ELM WHICH WAS GREATLY INFERIOR BOTH IN LIGHTNESS AND STRENGTH OF PIPES THAN WHICH NOTHING WAS MORE IMPORTANT IN THEIR EYES
SOON AFTER A MUCH LARGER BAND OF ONONDAGA IROQUOIS APPROACHING UNDISCOVERED BUILT A FORT ON THE MAIN LAND OPPOSITE THE ISLAND BUT CONCEALED FROM SIGHT IN THE FOREST HERE THEY WAITED TO WAYLAY ANY PARTY OF HURONS WHO MIGHT VENTURE ASHORE
SAVAGES TAMED NOT CIVILIZED FOR THAT WAS SCARCELY POSSIBLE WOULD HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED IN COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE VALLEYS OF THE GREAT LAKES AND THE MISSISSIPPI RULED BY PRIESTS IN THE INTEREST OF CATHOLICITY AND OF FRANCE
AND THEIR OWN PAST AND PROSPECTIVE EXPLOITS A HIDEOUS SCENE OF FEASTING FOLLOWED THE TORTURE OF A PRISONER LIKE THE TORTURE ITSELF IT WAS AMONG THE HURONS PARTLY AN ACT OF VENGEANCE AND PARTLY A RELIGIOUS RITE
AND TOOK POST WAIST DEEP IN MUD AND WATER AMONG THE TALL RUSHES AT THE MARGIN OF THE RIVER HERE THEY FOUGHT STUBBORNLY AND KEPT ALL THE FRENCHMEN AT BAY AT LENGTH FINDING THEMSELVES HARD PRESSED THEY ENTERED THEIR CANOES AGAIN AND PADDLED OFF
HE REACHED FOR THE FIRST TIME A PEOPLE SPEAKING A DIALECT OF THE IROQUOIS TONGUE HERE ALL WAS CHANGED POPULOUS TOWNS RUDE FORTIFICATIONS AND AN EXTENSIVE THOUGH BARBAROUS TILLAGE
HAD DISAPPEARED AT THE OPENING OF THE NEXT CENTURY AND ANOTHER RACE HAD SUCCEEDED IN LANGUAGE AND CUSTOMS WIDELY DIFFERENT WHILE IN THE REGION NOW FORMING THE STATE OF NEW YORK A POWER WAS RISING TO A FEROCIOUS VITALITY WHICH
WERE A GREAT NUMBER OF POLES LIKE THE PERCHES OF A HEN ROOST AND HERE WERE SUSPENDED WEAPONS CLOTHING SKINS AND ORNAMENTS HERE TOO IN HARVEST TIME THE SQUAWS HUNG THE EARS OF UNSHELLED CORN
THIS CALAMITY WAS FOUR YEARS AFTER FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER WHEN THE BEST OF THE HURON WARRIORS INCLUDING THEIR LEADER THE CRAFTY AND VALIANT ETIENNE ANNAOTAHA WERE SLAIN
IT WAS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED MILES BY THE WINDINGS OF THE STREAM BEFORE ONE REACHED THAT ALGONQUIN TRIBE
HIS SCOUTS HAD ALSO BEEN ALARMED BY DISCOVERING THE FOOTPRINTS OF RAGUENEAU'S INDIANS AND FOR SOME TIME THE TWO PARTIES STOOD ON THEIR GUARD EACH TAKING THE OTHER FOR AN ENEMY WHEN AT LENGTH THEY DISCOVERED THEIR MISTAKE
RUSHED UPON THEIR VISITORS AND CUT THEM TO PIECES ONE OF THEM WHO LINGERED FOR A TIME OWNED BEFORE HE DIED THAT ETIENNE'S SUSPICIONS WERE JUST AND THAT THEY HAD DESIGNED NOTHING LESS THAN THE MASSACRE OR CAPTURE OF ALL THE HURONS
BUT NOW NEW SCENES SUCCEED AND OTHER ACTORS ENTER ON THE STAGE A HARDY AND VALIANT BAND MOULDED TO ENDURE AND DARE
THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN WERE THEIR SEASONS OF SERIOUS EMPLOYMENT OF WAR HUNTING FISHING AND TRADE THERE WAS AN ESTABLISHED SYSTEM OF TRAFFIC
WHERE THE OCCUPANTS STORED THEIR FAMILY PROVISIONS AND OTHER ARTICLES FIVE OR SIX FEET ABOVE WAS ANOTHER PLATFORM OFTEN OCCUPIED BY CHILDREN ONE PAIR OF PLATFORMS SUFFICED FOR A FAMILY
AND SAID THAT IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH HIS PURPOSE HE HAD JOINED AN ALGONQUIN WAR PARTY WHO WERE IN THE WOODS NOT FAR OFF THE IROQUOIS IN GREAT DELIGHT DEMANDED TO BE SHOWN WHERE THEY WERE THIS JUDAS AS THE JESUITS CALL HIM
I TOLD HIM THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALL I HAD BUT HE SAID
YET THE WISH TO GO BACK TO MY WILD HAUNTS CLUNG ROUND ME LIKE A CLOUD AND I COULD IN NO WAY DRIVE IT FROM ME SO TRUE IS IT THAT WHAT IS BRED IN THE BONE WILL NOT COME OUT OF THE FLESH
NO DO NOT FEAR NOR RAISE YOUR HOPES TOO HIGH FOR YOU SEE BUT A MAN YET ONE WHO WILL DO ALL HE CAN TO HELP YOU YOUR SPEECH SHOWS ME THAT YOU COME FROM THE SAME LAND AS I DO
THAT I MUST MEET WITH SOME SHIP OR DIE
I SAW THAT THERE WERE BIRDS ON THE ISLE AND I SHOT ONE OF THEM MINE MUST HAVE BEEN THE FIRST GUN THAT HAD BEEN HEARD THERE SINCE THE WORLD WAS MADE FOR AT THE SOUND OF IT
AND LAY BUT A MILE FROM ME WHILE THE BOAT WAS ON THE BEACH TWO MILES ON MY RIGHT I WENT SOME WAY DOWN BY THE SHORE TO GET TO THE BOAT
THE MEN SAID THAT THEY HAD FOUND THE LAND IN TWO DAYS AND THAT THE WILD MEN GAVE THEM ROOTS AND FISH TO EAT AND WERE SO KIND AS TO BRING DOWN EIGHT SLAVES TO TAKE BACK WITH THEM THREE OF WHOM WERE MEN AND FIVE WERE GIRLS
AND THE SHIP STRUCK ON A BANK OF SAND IN WHICH SHE SANK SO DEEP THAT WE COULD NOT GET HER OFF
AS I HAVE SINCE FOUND THAT THERE WAS ONE NOTCH TOO FEW I NOW TOOK FROM MY STORE
ONE OF THESE BEASTS CAME NEAR OUR BOAT SO I LAY IN WAIT FOR HIM WITH MY GUN AND AS SOON AS THE BRUTE WAS IN RANGE I SHOT HIM THROUGH THE HEAD TWICE HE SANK DOWN IN THE SEA AND TWICE HE CAME UP
NOW IF I SAVE YOUR LIFE THERE ARE TWO THINGS WHICH YOU MUST DO BUT HE READ MY THOUGHTS AND SAID IF YOU SAVE MY LIFE YOU SHALL DO AS YOU LIKE WITH ME AND MY SHIP AND TAKE HER WHERE YOU PLEASE I SAW THAT THE TWO MEN IN WHOSE CHARGE THE BOAT HAD BEEN LEFT
AND WITH SUCH FORCE AS TO LEAVE ME IN A KIND OF SWOON WHICH THANK GOD DID NOT LAST LONG
AND HEARD THE SOUNDS OF MEN NOT OF ONE OR TWO BUT OF A GREAT CROWD WE NEED NOT DOUBT THAT THE CHIEF AND THE MAN WITH HIM NOW RAN BACK AT ONCE TO TELL ALL THE REST WHAT THEY HAD SEEN AND WHEN THEY HEARD THE NEWS
THEY WERE FULL OF SPITE AND CAME ONE DAY TO TEASE AND VEX THEM THEY TOLD THEM THAT THE ISLE WAS THEIR OWN AND THAT NO ONE ELSE HAD A RIGHT TO BUILD ON IT IF THEY DID NOT PAY RENT THE TWO GOOD MEN THOUGHT AT FIRST THAT THEY WERE IN JEST
AND SOON WE SAW SMOKE RISE FROM THE SIDE OF THE CREEK I THEN WENT ON SHORE IN A BOAT WITH THE PRIEST AND FRIDAY AND HUNG OUT A WHITE FLAG OF PEACE THE FIRST MAN I CAST MY EYES ON AT THE CREEK WAS MY OLD FRIEND CARL
NOW LIFT UP MY HANDS NOW FOLD THEM ON MY BREAST AND THANK GOD FOR ALL THAT HE HAD DONE FOR ME WHEN THE REST OF THE MEN WERE LOST
AND THESE I PUT ON THE RAFT WHEN THE HIGH TIDE CAME UP IT TOOK OFF MY COAT AND SHIRT WHICH I HAD LEFT ON THE SHORE BUT THERE WERE SOME FRESH CLOTHES IN THE SHIP
SO MUCH FOR THE SAD VIEW OF MY CASE BUT LIKE MOST THINGS IT HAD A BRIGHT SIDE AS WELL AS A DARK ONE FOR HERE WAS I SAFE ON LAND
ROUND ME AND TO ADD TO MY GRIEF THE KIND FRIEND WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HERE IN HIS SHIP NOW MEANT TO LEAVE THESE SHORES ON MY FIRST START TO SEA WHEN A BOY
AS SOON AS I FOUND THIS OUT I SENT THE LONG BOAT ON SHORE WITH TWELVE MEN AND THE MATE AND OFF THEY WENT TO SEEK THE TWO WHO HAD LEFT THE SHIP BUT THEIR SEARCH WAS IN VAIN NOR COULD THEY FIND ONE OF THE REST
THEY TOOK HEART AND CAME THEY AT ONCE MADE FOR THEIR PRIZE AND BY THE HELP OF A ROPE WHICH THEY SLUNG ROUND HIM THEY BROUGHT HIM SAFE ON THE BEACH
WHEN THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN GONE AN HOUR OR TWO HE BROUGHT WORD BACK THAT HE HAD BEEN IN THE MIDST OF THE FOES THOUGH THEY HAD NOT SEEN HIM AND THAT THEY WERE IN TWO SETS OR TRIBES WHO WERE AT WAR AND HAD COME THERE TO FIGHT
NOW THAT I HAD TWO FREIGHTS OF GOODS AT HAND I MADE A TENT WITH THE SHIP'S SAILS TO STOW THEM IN AND CUT THE POLES FOR IT FROM THE WOOD
THUS MY FRIENDS WERE SET FREE FROM ALL THEIR FEARS AND SAW NO MORE OF THEIR WILD FOES FOR SOME TIME ONE DAY A WHIM TOOK THE THREE BAD MEN THAT THEY WOULD GO TO THE MAIN LAND FROM WHENCE THE WILD MEN CAME
I COULD BUT CRY OUT IN THE WORDS OF THE PSALM THEY THAT GO DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS THESE MEN SEE THE WORKS OF THE LORD IN THE DEEP FOR AT HIS WORD THE STORMS RISE
THAT ALL MY GOODS WOULD FALL OFF TO WAIT TILL THE TIDE CAME UP WAS ALL THAT COULD BE DONE SO WHEN THE SEA WAS A FOOT DEEP I THRUST THE RAFT
ONE DAY FRIDAY RAN UP TO ME IN GREAT GLEE AND SAID THEY ARE BACK THEY ARE BACK A MILE FROM SHORE THERE WAS A BOAT WITH A SAIL WHICH STOOD IN FOR THE LAND
AND HAD SEEN NO WILD MEN I MADE A GUESS
I DID MY BEST TO FLOAT ON THE TOP AND HELD MY BREATH TO DO SO THE NEXT WAVE WAS QUITE AS HIGH AND SHUT ME UP IN ITS BULK I HELD MY HANDS DOWN TIGHT TO MY SIDE
THAT THE HOUSE COULD NOT BE GOT AT SAVE BY SUCH BLIND WAYS AS NONE BUT THOSE WHO MADE THEM COULD FIND OUT WHY HAVE YOU BUILT ALL THESE FORTS SAID I
AND THEN I SET OFF WITH ALL MY MIGHT TO THE SHORE
I HAD PUT A SMALL SUM IN THE HANDS OF AN AUNT AND THIS MY FRIEND SAID I SHOULD DO WELL TO SPEND ON MY FARM SO WHEN HE GOT HOME HE SENT SOME OF IT IN CASH
BUT RAIN FELL ALL THAT NIGHT AND A GREAT PART OF THE NEXT DAY NOW THOUGH QUITE WORN OUT I HAD TO MOVE MY GOODS WHICH WERE IN THE CAVE TO SOME SAFE PLACE
THE LAND IN FRONT OF US RAN OUT FOUR OR FIVE MILES LIKE A BILL AND WE HAD TO KEEP SOME WAY FROM THE COAST TO MAKE THIS POINT SO THAT WE LOST SIGHT OF THE SHORE
I TOOK WITH ME AS LARGE A STORE OF TOOLS CLOTHES AND SUCH LIKE GOODS AS I HAD ROOM FOR AND MEN OF SKILL IN ALL KINDS OF TRADES TO LIVE IN THE ISLE WHEN WE SET SAIL WE HAD A FAIR WIND FOR SOME TIME BUT ONE NIGHT THE MATE
WHICH YOU SEE OUT THERE AND HAVE LEFT ME HERE TO DIE IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO TO MAKE THEM SHEATH THEIR SWORDS WHICH YOU SAW WERE DRAWN TO SLAY ME THEY HAVE SET ME DOWN IN THIS ISLE WITH THESE TWO MEN MY FRIEND HERE AND THE SHIP'S MATE
WHICH SAT ON ONE OF THE CHESTS WHEN I CAME UP I HELD MY GUN AT HER BUT AS SHE DID NOT KNOW
NOR WOULD THEY FOR A LONG WHILE GIVE THEM FOOD TO EAT SO THE TWO POOR MEN HAD TO LIVE AS WELL AS THEY COULD BY HARD WORK AND THEY SET UP THEIR TENTS ON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE ISLE TO BE OUT OF THE WAY OF THE WILD MEN
ONE DAY WHEN THE TWO MEN WERE OUT THEY CAME TO THEIR HOME AND SAID HA THERE'S THE NEST BUT THE BIRDS ARE FLOWN THEY THEN SET TO WORK TO PULL DOWN BOTH THE HUTS AND LEFT NOT A STICK NOR SCARCE A SIGN ON THE GROUND TO SHOW WHERE THE TENTS HAD STOOD
BUT I KNEW IT COULD NOT BE THE ONE WHICH OUR TWO FRIENDS HAD GONE OUT IN FOR IT WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ISLE FOR THAT I SAW TOO THROUGH MY GLASS A SHIP OUT AT SEA THERE WERE TWELVE MEN IN THE BOAT THREE OF WHOM WERE BOUND IN CHAINS
THE HEART OF EACH NOW GREW FAINT OUR CHEEKS WERE PALE AND OUR EYES WERE DIM FOR THERE WAS BUT ONE HOPE AND THAT WAS TO FIND SOME BAY AND SO GET IN THE LEE OF THE LAND
WHICH GAVE SO GREAT A CHARM TO THE SPOT AS TO MAKE ME WISH TO LIVE THERE BUT
NO ONE TO MAKE ME THINK IT WAS DULL TO ROAM DAY BY DAY FROM THE WOOD TO THE SHORE
HERE I HAD WELL NIGH LOST MY FREIGHT FOR THE SHORE LAY ON A SLOPE SO THAT THERE WAS NO PLACE TO LAND ON SAVE WHERE ONE END OF THE RAFT WOULD LIE SO HIGH AND ONE END SO LOW
AND I BROUGHT BACK AS MUCH AS THE RAFT WOULD HOLD ONE DAY I HAD PUT TOO GREAT A LOAD ON THE RAFT WHICH MADE IT SINK DOWN ON ONE SIDE SO THAT THE GOODS WERE LOST IN THE SEA
WHICH WAS ON BOARD AND CUT A MAST IN THREE LENGTHS AND THESE GAVE GREAT STRENGTH TO THE RAFT I FOUND SOME BREAD AND RICE A DUTCH CHEESE AND SOME DRY GOAT'S FLESH THERE HAD BEEN SOME WHEAT
I WILL NOT LEAVE THEE AND THEY HAVE DWELT IN MY HEART TO THIS DAY I LAID DOWN THE BOOK TO PRAY MY CRY WAS O LORD
THAT I SHOULD TAKE FOUR OF THEM TO WORK THE SHIP AND THAT THE REST WOULD BE BOUND HAND AND FOOT FOR THE GOOD FAITH OF THE FOUR THIS WAS TO SHOW THEM WHAT A STERN KING I WAS OF COURSE I SOON SET THEM FREE AND I PUT THEM IN A WAY TO TAKE MY PLACE ON THE ISLE
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING FOR ME IF I HAD NOT HAD FARMS AND LAND
MY EYES FELL ON FIVE WORDS THAT WOULD SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PUT THERE FOR MY GOOD AT THIS TIME SO WELL DID THEY CHEER MY FAINT HOPES AND TOUCH THE TRUE SOURCE OF MY FEARS
I DID NOT DESERVE IN MY OWN OPINION AT LEAST TO BE SO TOTALLY FORGOTTEN BY MY FATHER AND I THOUGHT MY PRESENT EXCURSION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF BRINGING A LETTER FROM HIM TO HAND MORE EARLY THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE REACHED ME
STAY I KEN JUST THE BEAST THAT WILL ANSWER ME AT FIVE IN THE MORNING THEN ANDREW YOU WILL MEET ME AT THE HEAD OF THE AVENUE DEIL A FEAR O ME
BUT BEFORE CONCLUDING MY LETTER CONCERNING THE AFFAIR OF MORRIS I FAILED NOT TO EXPRESS MY EARNEST HOPE AND WISH THAT MY FATHER WOULD HONOUR ME WITH A FEW LINES
FOLLOWING HIM WITH EYES IN WHICH DISDAIN WAS ADMIRABLY PAINTED THE PRINCE OF GROOMS AND COCK FIGHTERS AND BLACKGUARD HORSE COURSERS BUT THERE IS NOT ONE OF THEM TO MEND ANOTHER HAVE YOU READ MARKHAM SAID MISS VERNON READ WHOM MA'AM
MINE HOST AND HIS SUNDAY GUESTS AFTER AN EFFORT OR TWO TO SUPPORT THEIR CONSEQUENCE BY NOISE AND BOLD AVERMENT SUNK GRADUALLY UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF MISTER CAMPBELL WHO THUS FAIRLY POSSESSED HIMSELF OF THE LEAD IN THE CONVERSATION
I PAUSED THEREFORE ON A RISING GROUND AND NOT UNMOVED BY THE SENSE OF INTEREST WHICH THAT SPECIES OF SILVAN SPORT IS SO MUCH CALCULATED TO INSPIRE
AND CONFER ON OUR FRIEND MISTER QUITAM THE PREFERMENT OF SOLICITOR GENERAL AND HE MAY ALSO GRANT SOME GOOD DEED OR REWARD TO THIS HONEST GENTLEMAN WHO IS SITTING UPON HIS PORTMANTEAU WHICH HE PREFERS TO A CHAIR AND QUESTIONLESS
BUT COMMEND ME TO STERLING HONESTY THOUGH CLAD IN RAGS AS THE POET SAITH I HAVE BEEN CREDIBLY ASSURED SIR BY MEN ON WHOM I CAN DEPEND THAT THERE WAS NEVER KNOWN SUCH A THING IN SCOTLAND AS A HIGHWAY ROBBERY
THAT MISTER VAUGHAN MIGHT OCCUPY RASHLEIGH'S APARTMENT DURING HIS OCCASIONAL RESIDENCE AT THE HALL AND HIS PROFESSION RENDERED IT LIKELY THAT HE SHOULD OCCASIONALLY BE A TENANT OF THE LIBRARY
AND THROWING DOWN THE PRICE OF THE ADDITIONAL BOTTLE WHICH HE HAD HIMSELF INTRODUCED ROSE AS IF TO TAKE LEAVE OF US
A COUNTERPART TO THIS DECENT PRACTICE AND A REMNANT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY WAS THAT THE LANDLORD OF A PRINCIPAL INN LAID ASIDE HIS CHARACTER OF A PUBLICAN ON THE SEVENTH DAY AND INVITED THE GUESTS WHO CHANCED TO BE WITHIN HIS WALLS
THAT HE SCARCELY EVER MENTIONED THE RACE FROM WHICH HE SPRUNG AND HELD AS THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE SPECIES OF VANITY THE WEAKNESS WHICH IS COMMONLY TERMED FAMILY PRIDE HIS AMBITION WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED AS WILLIAM OSBALDISTONE THE FIRST
HE HAD THE HARD FEATURES AND ATHLETIC FORM SAID TO BE PECULIAR TO HIS COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH THE NATIONAL INTONATION AND SLOW PEDANTIC MODE OF EXPRESSION ARISING FROM A DESIRE TO AVOID PECULIARITIES OF IDIOM OR DIALECT
I WAS TEMPTED FROM CURIOSITY TO DISPUTE THE GROUND WITH HIM MYSELF CONFIDING IN MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD
AND MUCH RESPECTED AMONG THE CATHOLICS OF NORTHUMBERLAND AS A WORTHY AND UPRIGHT MAN YET FATHER VAUGHAN DID NOT ALTOGETHER LACK THOSE PECULIARITIES WHICH DISTINGUISH HIS ORDER THERE HUNG ABOUT HIM AN AIR OF MYSTERY WHICH IN PROTESTANT EYES
I RODE OVER TO THE POST TOWN
I HAD ALREADY FELT MYSELF BECOMING JEALOUS OF THE CONTEMPTIBLE LOUT THORNCLIFF AND TAKING MORE NOTICE THAN IN PRUDENCE OR DIGNITY OF FEELING I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE OF HIS SILLY ATTEMPTS TO PROVOKE ME
SO THAT I RETURNED TO OSBALDISTONE HALL A GOOD DEAL RICHER THAN I HAD SET FORTH THIS RECRUIT TO MY FINANCES WAS NOT A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO ME AS I WAS NECESSARILY INVOLVED IN SOME EXPENSES AT OSBALDISTONE HALL
I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NONE SUCH IN SCOTLAND NA NA ANSWERED ANDREW BOLDLY THEN SHADED AWAY HIS NEGATIVE WITH UNLESS IT BE ON FASTERN'S E'EN OR THE LIKE O THAT
I HIGHLY APPROVED OF ANDREW'S AMENDMENT ON MY ORIGINAL PROPOSAL AND WE AGREED TO MEET AT THE PLACE APPOINTED AT THREE IN THE MORNING AT ONCE HOWEVER A REFLECTION CAME ACROSS THE MIND OF MY INTENDED TRAVELLING COMPANION
AND I FELT ENCOURAGED TO PUT MY HORSE TO THE SAME PACE AND TO KEEP IN HER IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD THE CLAMOUR OF WHOOP DEAD DEAD AND THE CORRESPONDING FLOURISH OF THE FRENCH HORN SOON ANNOUNCED TO US THAT THERE WAS NO MORE OCCASION FOR HASTE SINCE THE CHASE
REPLIED ANDREW IS NAETHING
AND THEN INTIMATED HIS INTENTION OF LEAVING ME THAT HE MIGHT HELP THE HUNTSMAN AND HIS BROTHERS TO COUPLE UP THE HOUNDS A PURPOSE WHICH HE RATHER COMMUNICATED BY WAY OF INFORMATION TO MISS VERNON THAN AS APOLOGY TO ME THERE HE GOES SAID THE YOUNG LADY
I DETERMINED TO CONSULT ANDREW FAIRSERVICE ON THE SUBJECT AS THE NEAREST AND MOST AUTHENTIC AUTHORITY WITHIN MY REACH LATE AS IT WAS I SET OFF WITH THE INTENTION OF ASCERTAINING THIS IMPORTANT POINT AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES WALK REACHED THE DWELLING OF THE GARDENER
BY DOING SO I OBTAINED POSSESSION SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN I SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE OF THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM MY FRIEND MISTER OWEN DEAR MISTER FRANCIS YOURS RECEIVED PER FAVOUR OF MISTER R OSBALDISTONE
FLAY'D BY A GHOST ANDREW
AND TRICKY IN THE BUSINESS OF PEACEFUL LIFE AND HAVING FEW GOOD QUALITIES UNLESS THERE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED SUCH A FEROCITY WHICH RESEMBLED COURAGE IN MARTIAL AFFAIRS AND A SORT OF WILY CRAFT WHICH SUPPLIED THE PLACE OF WISDOM IN THE ORDINARY COMMERCE OF MANKIND
AND FROM HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WHIGS THEN IN POWER HAD INFLUENCE ENOUGH TO OBTAIN A HEARING FOR MY CAUSE SO UPON THE WHOLE I JUDGED IT MOST SAFE TO STATE MY WHOLE STORY IN THE SHAPE OF A NARRATIVE
AWARE THAT A HUNTING FIELD WAS NOT THE PROPER SCENE TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO A KEEN SPORTSMAN AND DETERMINED WHEN THEY HAD PASSED ON TO PROCEED TO THE MANSION HOUSE AT MY OWN PACE AND THERE TO AWAIT THE RETURN OF THE PROPRIETOR FROM HIS SPORT
UNLESS INDEED I COULD SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS THE AGENT EMPLOYED TO PROCURE HER SETTLEMENT IN THE CLOISTER IN THE EVENT OF HER REJECTING A UNION WITH EITHER OF MY COUSINS
THEN I SUPPOSE YOU CAN NEITHER GIVE A BALL NOR A MASH NOR A HORN
THAT MY FATHER SHOULD LEAVE THE CARE OF SUPPLYING MY NECESSITIES TO HIS CLERK BUT I CONCLUDED IT WAS A MATTER ARRANGED BETWEEN THEM AT ANY RATE OWEN WAS A BACHELOR RICH IN HIS WAY AND PASSIONATELY ATTACHED TO ME
I HAD THEREFORE A FULL VIEW OF HER UNCOMMONLY FINE FACE AND PERSON TO WHICH AN INEXPRESSIBLE CHARM WAS ADDED BY THE WILD GAIETY OF THE SCENE AND THE ROMANCE OF HER SINGULAR DRESS AND UNEXPECTED APPEARANCE
AND THE PRIEST WAS MARKED WITH SOMETHING LIKE THE SAME MYSTERY WHICH CHARACTERISED HER COMMUNICATIONS WITH RASHLEIGH I HAD NEVER HEARD HER MENTION VAUGHAN'S NAME OR EVEN ALLUDE TO HIM EXCEPTING ON THE OCCASION OF OUR FIRST MEETING
TO TAKE A PART OF HIS FAMILY BEEF AND PUDDING THIS INVITATION
BUT WHAT ON EARTH BRINGS YOU TO CUB CASTLE FOR SO THE NEIGHBOURS HAVE CHRISTENED THIS HUNTING HALL OF OURS YOU MIGHT HAVE STAYED AWAY I SUPPOSE IF YOU WOULD
YOU SIR DOUBTLESS ARE WELL MOUNTED AND I FOR THE PRESENT TRAVEL ON FOOT OR ON A HIGHLAND SHELTY THAT DOES NOT HELP ME MUCH FASTER FORWARD SO SAYING HE CALLED FOR A RECKONING FOR THE WINE
AND COMING UP TO ME AS THE COMPANY WERE DISPERSING OBSERVED YOUR FRIEND SIR IS TOO COMMUNICATIVE CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF HIS TRUST THAT GENTLEMAN I REPLIED LOOKING TOWARDS THE TRAVELLER IS NO FRIEND OF MINE
DOST FEAR TO RIDE WITH ME BURGER THERE IS ONE ADVANTAGE IN AN ACCUMULATION OF EVILS DIFFERING IN CAUSE AND CHARACTER THAT THE DISTRACTION WHICH THEY AFFORD BY THEIR CONTRADICTORY OPERATION PREVENTS THE PATIENT
LED ME TO THINK THAT ANDREW ACCORDING TO THE DECENT AND MERITORIOUS CUSTOM OF HIS COUNTRYMEN HAD ASSEMBLED SOME OF HIS NEIGHBOURS TO JOIN IN FAMILY EXERCISE AS HE CALLED EVENING DEVOTION
HAVING IN THE HURRY OF THE CHASE ESCAPED FROM THE RIBBON WHICH BOUND IT SOME VERY BROKEN GROUND THROUGH WHICH SHE GUIDED HER HORSE WITH THE MOST ADMIRABLE ADDRESS AND PRESENCE OF MIND RETARDED HER COURSE AND BROUGHT HER CLOSER TO ME THAN ANY OF THE OTHER RIDERS HAD PASSED
IF NOT POVERTY HIS CONVERSATION INTIMATED THAT HE WAS ENGAGED IN THE CATTLE TRADE NO VERY DIGNIFIED PROFESSIONAL PURSUIT AND YET
I CAN RIDE OUT OF THE WAY AND NEVER MISS A DAY OR SO FOR GOOD COMPANY UPON MY FAITH SIR SAID CAMPBELL I CANNOT RENDER YOU THE SERVICE YOU SEEM TO DESIDERATE I AM HE ADDED DRAWING HIMSELF UP HAUGHTILY TRAVELLING ON MY OWN PRIVATE AFFAIRS
THIS GAVE ME NO DESIRE TO CULTIVATE HIS INTIMACY NOR DID HE SEEM TO MAKE ANY ADVANCES TOWARDS MINE SO OUR OCCASIONAL INTERCOURSE WAS CONFINED TO THE EXCHANGE OF MERE CIVILITY I CONSIDERED IT AS EXTREMELY PROBABLE
ANSWERED MY COMPANION AND THEN TURNING TO ME HE GAVE VENT TO THE TENOR OF HIS OWN REFLECTIONS I RESPECT THE SCOTCH SIR I LOVE AND HONOUR THE NATION FOR THEIR SENSE OF MORALITY MEN TALK OF THEIR FILTH AND THEIR POVERTY
FORBIDDING IN THE EXTREME BUT THE FERTILE FIELDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE SPREAD THEMSELVES LIKE A VAST AND BEAUTIFUL GREEN CARPET DOTTED HERE AND THERE WITH LITTLE VILLAGES CROWNED WITH CHURCH SPIRES AND THEIR CORRESPONDING BELFRIES
TO RECOVER A BALL AT WHATEVER DISTANCE WHEN A DISPUTE AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD GET IT OR TO LOOK FOR A LOST KITE NO MATTER HOW THICK THE BRAMBLES MIGHT BE NO WONDER LOUIS WAS QUITE CONTENT TO HAVE SUCH AN ACCOMMODATING COMPANION
OUR JOYS WERE HERS OUR SORROWS WERE HER SORROWS SHE HAD GROWN IN BODY AND MIND AND YET HAD KEPT THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS ALWAYS BRIGHT AND HAPPY AND FULL OF FUN SHE HAD THE SAME SIMPLE HUMBLE WAYS AS WHEN AT TEN YEARS OF AGE SHE HAD COME AMONG US
YOU HARDLY HAVE ANY SIMILIARITY IN YOUR FACE BUT YOUR VOICE IS LIKE HERS NOW LET ME HUG YOU ONCE MORE MY TREASURE AND TERESA PRESSED TO HER HEART THE MOTHERLESS CHILD IN MY COUNTRY THEY SAY I AM LIKE PAPA
I DESERVED TO BE REFUSED
WE DID NOT KNOW AT WHAT HOUR MY FATHER WOULD COME FROM PARIS WITH PAULA AND SO EVERY MOMENT I SAID TO MYSELF PERHAPS THEY HAVE ARRIVED RESULT
YOU MADEMOISELLE YOU MADE ME FEEL THAT YOU REALLY LOVED ME
AND WE ARE HER NEAREST RELATIVES YOUR UNCLE'S FRIENDS HAVE WRITTEN ME
AND I WILL SHOW IT TO YOU SHOW IT TO US NOW I SHOUTED BUT TERESA INTERRUPTED ME WHAT A CHILD YOU ARE WHEN POOR PAULA IS SO TIRED TOMORROW WILL BE TIME ENOUGH
THE REST OF THE LAND AROUND THE CONVENT HAD
I CLOSED THE DOOR GENTLY BEHIND ME AND STOLE AWAY LATER PAULA SAID TO ME OH LISITA I'M SURELY BAD INDEED ONE THING I'VE CERTAINLY HATED TO DO AND THAT IS TO SIT DOWN AND LEARN TO SEW ESPECIALLY IN FINE WEATHER LIKE THIS
DROP THAT WORK AND GO WHERE YOU PLEASE BUT REMEMBER THIS NEVER WILL YOU BE CALLED A DORCAS NEVER WILL YOU BE ABLE TO SEW AND PROVIDE GARMENTS FOR THE POOR IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO TELL THEM YOU LOVE THEM YOU MUST SHOW IT BY YOUR WORKS AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO LEARN TO BE USEFUL TO THEM
NOTWITHSTANDING THIS
CLEARLY ENGRAVED ON THE WALLS OF MY MEMORY THERE STILL REMAINS A PICTURE OF THE GREAT GRAY HOUSE WHERE I SPENT MY CHILDHOOD IT WAS ORIGINALLY USED FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AS THE CONVENT OF THE WHITE LADIES WITH ITS FOUR LONG GALLERIES
PATIENCE PATIENCE CRIED MY FATHER YOUR TURN WILL COME TERESA YOU ARE GETTING OLD AND ANOTHER GIRL IN THE HOUSE SIMPLY MEANS MORE WORK FOR YOU AND A LOT MORE PROBLEMS FOR ME IF SHE
ONE ABOVE THE OTHER LOOKING PROUDLY DOWN UPON THE HUMBLER DWELLINGS OF THE VILLAGE
THAT YOU HAD BEEN WITH US FOR MANY MONTHS INSTEAD OF A FEW DAYS
THEN TURNING TO US HE ADDED YOU NO DOUBT KNOW BY THIS TIME OF WHOM WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING YOUR COUSIN PAULA HAS JUST LOST HER FATHER
WERE TOO MUCH FOR ME AND HERE I BROKE DOWN COMPLETELY
IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANSY BED
THEN SUDDENLY PAULA SHE CALLED PAULA HERE I AM MARGUERITE AND PAULA CAME CLOSER TAKING HER HAND AH YOU ARE HERE THANKS DEAR PAULA SHE GASPED
OUT WE WENT INTO THE GARDEN TO PLAY NOT WITHOUT AN ANXIOUS LOOK FROM TERESA FOR SHE KNEW THAT WHEN LOUIS CAME INTO ANY SITUATION HE GENERALLY CAUSED TROUBLE WHEN HOWEVER
AND AS I LOOKED AT THAT PURE BEAUTIFUL FACE WITH THE EYES CLOSED IN PRAYER WITH ITS FRAME OF GLORIOUS HAIR I KNEW THAT NEVER HAD I SEEN ANYTHING SO LOVELY AS THIS CHILD COMPANION OF MINE JUST BUDDING INTO WOMANHOOD
MY HEAD WASN'T IN VERY GOOD CONDITION AS I'D LEFT MY WITS BEHIND AT THE LIQUOR SHOP
ONLY TOO GLAD TO ABANDON MY TOWEL I RAN TO OPEN THE DOOR BUT HARDLY HAD I DONE SO WHEN I REMAINED PETRIFIED AND DUMB WITH SURPRISE HARDLY ABLE TO BELIEVE MY OWN EYES THERE STOOD THE BRETON TWISTING HIS BATTERED CAP NERVOUSLY BETWEEN HIS BONY FINGERS
SHE LAUGHED WHAT PUT SUCH A NOTION IN YOUR HEAD DO I LOOK AS IF I WAS SICK I WAS SO RELIEVED TERESA WAS QUITE MISTAKEN NO CONTINUED PAULA
SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN CONTINUED IN HER QUIET SIMPLE WAY
IN SCHOOL I TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE IN FACT I TALKED ABOUT HER ALL DAY AND EVERY DAY I LEARNED NOTHING NOR COULD I SEEM TO DO ANYTHING AROUND THE HOUSE
AS SHE SLIGHTLY RAISED THE SICK GIRL'S HEAD DEAREST MARGUERITE SAID OUR TEACHER HERE ARE PAULA AND LISITA
AND THE BRETON SHOOK HIS HEAD SADLY IT'S TOO LATE NOW TO GET ANYTHING OF THAT SORT IN THIS DULL HEAD
FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE VILLAGERS THEMSELVES EACH ONE HAD A SMALL SPACE FOR FLOWERS IN FRONT AND A VEGETABLE GARDEN BEHIND OF COURSE
JUST AT THIS MOMENT WE HEARD A VOICE CALLING
WHAT'S THAT IT'S A BOOK A PART OF THE BIBLE THAT TELLS US ABOUT THE LORD JESUS AND HOW HE SAVES US FROM THE GUILT AND POWER OF SIN AND HOW WE CAN SERVE HIM WELL MADEMOISELLE REPLIED THE BRETON IF IT'S A BOOK IT'S OF NO USE TO ME I DON'T KNOW HOW TO READ
THEN AWAY PAULA WOULD GO INTO THE GARDEN OR UNDER THE TREES THAT LINED THE VILLAGE STREET SOON SHE WAS BACK WITH SUCH A HAPPY SMILE THAT TERESA FORGAVE HER COMPLETELY ONCE HOWEVER TERESA LOST ALL PATIENCE WITH HER EXCLAIMING
ONE DOESN'T HAVE TO REFLECT LONG ABOUT DOING GOOD WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHY I HESITATE I'M SURE THAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD MUCH BETTER REPLACE THE PARENTS OF THIS ORPHANED GIRL I MUST CONFESS THAT FOR MY PART I DON'T FEEL EQUAL TO THE TASK
VIBRANT WITH EMOTION HAD MOVED US ALL TO THE DEPTHS OF OUR SOULS YOU ARE A VALIANT WOMAN WITH A GREAT HEART MY FATHER SAID AS HE TOOK HER HAND I WILL WRITE THIS VERY NIGHT AND ASK THEM TO SEND THE GIRL TO US AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AND WITH HER HEAD IN HER HAND COMMENCED TO READ TERESA WAS NOT VERY WELL EDUCATED
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IN THE FUTURE IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THESE THINGS I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW PAULA WOULD SAY SADLY AND WOULD TAKE UP THE WORK ONCE MORE WITH SUCH SWEET RESIGNATION THAT TERESA MOVED WITH COMPASSION
AT LAST THE GREAT DAY ARRIVED IT WAS A WEDNESDAY
NOT I SAID PAULA WITH A HEIGHTENED COLOR LOUIS WAS FURIOUS NO YOU SAY OH HE LAUGHED THE WALL'S TOO HIGH PAULA LOOKED AT THE WALL IT WAS CERTAINLY HIGH
MANY THANKS FOR TELLING ME ABOUT JESUS AND HIS LOVE FOR ME SING THE SENTENCE WAS NEVER FINISHED BUT PAULA'S SWEET VOICE ROSE AS ONCE AGAIN SHE SANG THE SUBLIME WORDS
COME NOW WON'T YOU MY BROTHER SEEMED TO HESITATE YOU KNOW I HATED TO DISOBEY ADDED PAULA WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AND AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T LIKE TO BE A TATTLE TALE WON'T YOU PLEASE COME HOME NOW WITH ME
CALLED MY FATHER ALL RIGHT I'M COMING SAID THAT GOOD LADY READ THIS AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF IT AND MY FATHER HANDED THE LETTER TO THE OLD SERVANT TERESA SEATED HERSELF AT THE END OF THE TABLE BETWEEN LOUIS AND ME
NONSENSE YOU FOOLISH YOUNGSTER THAT'S NOT A LIE WE'LL GO FROM HERE AT THE DOT OF NINE ACCORDING TO MY WATCH AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL TELL TERESA IN CASE SHE ASKS US OF COURSE IF SHE DOESN'T ASK US
AND ITS NOISY BEE HIVES IN FACT IT WAS IN OUR EYES THE MOST ENCHANTING CORNER OF THE EARTH I DON'T REMEMBER ALL THE DETAILS ABOUT THE SPECIAL THING THAT HAPPENED ONE DAY BUT I KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT TO THE END OF MY LIFE
IN ANTICIPATION I HAD FANCIED PAULA AS A PALE SAD LITTLE GIRL WITH BLUE EYES FULL OF TEARS SHE WOULD HAVE GOLDEN HAIR VERY SMOOTH CUT OFF AT THE BASE OF HER EARS
FOR WE HAD LOST OUR OWN DEAR MOTHER WHEN I WAS STILL IN THE CRADLE MY BROTHER AND I HAD QUARRELLED OVER A MERE NOTHING WHEN WE WERE CALLED IN TO TEA BY OUR FATHER OF COURSE WE DID NOT DARE CONTINUE OUR DISPUTE OPENLY IN FRONT OF HIM
A BLACK SHAWL WHOSE POINTS PASSED UNDER HER ARMS AND WERE KNOTTED BEHIND PROTECTED HER SHOULDERS WHILE A PAIR OF GREAT THICK SHOES COMPLETED HER ATTIRE IN SPITE OF WHAT TO OUR MIND WAS A CERTAIN QUAINT ODDNESS IN HER DRESS
FELT THAT IT SHOULD BE GIVEN ALSO TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE ENGLISH SPEAKING WORLD NOT ONLY THAT THEY MIGHT KNOW PAULA HERSELF BUT THAT THROUGH HER THEY MIGHT BECOME MORE INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH PAULA'S SAVIOUR
HER SPECIAL SUMMER DELIGHT WAS TO RUN THROUGH THE FIELDS ALWAYS RETURNING TO THE HOUSE WITH A BIG BUNCH OF WILD FLOWERS FOR CATALINA IN ONE THING ONLY SHE ALWAYS SEEMED TO FAIL TERESA HAD A FEARFUL TASK IN TEACHING HER TO SEW AND TO KNIT
BUT SHE DID LOVE GOD WITH ALL HER HEART AND HER NEIGHBOR AS HERSELF THIS SIMPLE COUNTRY GIRL YOUNG AND STRONG YET SO TENDER HEARTED AND FORGETFUL OF SELF APPEARS TO ME SOMETIMES LIKE ONE OF THE CLEAR BROOKS OF MY BELOVED LAND PURE AND FRESH
DON'T CRY MOTHER SHE SAID AS SHE CAUGHT A LOW SOB FROM THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM
THE THIN BARK IS STREAKED AND SPRINKLED WITH RESIN AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SHOWERED UPON THE FOREST LIKE RAIN THEREFORE THIS TREE MORE THAN ANY OTHER IS SUBJECT TO DESTRUCTION BY FIRE DURING STRONG WINDS EXTENSIVE FORESTS ARE DESTROYED
AFTER WAITING STILL ANOTHER DAY THE EXPEDITION STARTED FOR THE VALLEY WHEN TENAYA WAS QUESTIONED AS TO THE ROUTE AND DISTANCE HE SAID THAT THE SNOW WAS SO DEEP THAT THE HORSES COULD NOT GO THROUGH IT
POHONO THE BRIDAL VEIL BEING THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE EXPEDITION REMAINED ONLY ONE DAY AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE VALLEY HURRYING OUT ON THE APPROACH OF A STORM AND REACHED THE SOUTH FORK HEADQUARTERS
WHICH BROAD DEEP AND FAR REACHING EXERTED VAST INFLUENCE ON THE SCENERY OF THIS PORTION OF THE SIERRA BUT THERE ARE FINE CAMPING GROUNDS
ON TREES THAT OCCUPY EXPOSED SITUATIONS NEAR ITS UPPER LIMIT THE BARK IS DEEP REDDISH BROWN AND RATHER DEEPLY FURROWED THE MAIN FURROWS RUNNING NEARLY PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER AND CONNECTED ON THE OLD TREES BY CONSPICUOUS CROSS FURROWS
SOME SPECIMENS THAT I MEASURED WERE OVER A HUNDRED FEET HIGH AND TWENTY FOUR FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE SHOWING HARDLY A TRACE OF SEVERE STORMS LOOKING AS FRESH AND VIGOROUS AS THE GIANTS OF THE LOWER ZONES
MOST OF IT HAD BEEN EXPLORED IN A GENERAL WAY AND SOME OF ITS PRINCIPAL FEATURES HAD BEEN NAMED BUT THE INDIANS HAD FLED UP THE TENAYA CANYON TRAIL AND NONE OF THEM WERE SEEN EXCEPT AN OLD WOMAN UNABLE TO FOLLOW THE FUGITIVES
THE LOWER LIMBS LIKE THOSE OF MOST OTHER CONIFERS THAT GROW IN SNOWY REGIONS CURVE DOWNWARD GRADUALLY TAKE A HORIZONTAL POSITION ABOUT HALF WAY UP THE TRUNK THEN ASPIRE MORE AND MORE TOWARD THE SUMMIT
AND SWEEP IT ONWARD FROM PEAK TO PEAK IN THE FORM OF SMOOTH REGULAR BANNERS OR IN CLOUDY DRIFTS ACCORDING TO THE VELOCITY AND DIRECTION OF THE WIND AND THE CONFORMATION OF THE SLOPES OVER WHICH IT IS DRIVEN
COMPELLING HUGE SLEEPING BOULDERS TO WAKE UP AND JOIN IN THEIR DANCE AND SONG TO SWELL THEIR EXULTING CHORUS IN EARLY SUMMER AFTER THE FLOOD SEASON THE YOSEMITE STREAMS ARE IN THEIR PRIME
AND TO THE BIG TUOLUMNE CANYON WITH ITS GLORIOUS ABUNDANCE OF ROCK AND FALLING GLIDING TOSSING WATER FOR ALL THESE THE BEAUTIFUL MEADOWS NEAR THE SODA SPRINGS FORM A DELIGHTFUL CENTER
TO SEE YOUR PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT COME THEY WILL COME IF I FIND THEM YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY OF MY PEOPLE THERE SAID TENAYA I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE MY TRIBE IS SMALL
ALIVE OR DEAD AS IS DOES OVER A GLACIER BOULDER I HAVE SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME TRYING TO DETERMINE THE AGE OF THESE WONDERFUL TREES BUT AS ALL OF THE VERY OLD ONES ARE HONEY COMBED WITH DRY ROT I NEVER WAS ABLE TO GET A COMPLETE COUNT OF THE LARGEST
I KNEW THE CLIMB WOULD REQUIRE A LONG TIME SOME THREE OR FOUR HOURS AS I ESTIMATED BUT IT PROVED FAR MORE DIFFICULT THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED MOST OF THE WAY I SANK WAIST DEEP
THE AVERAGE SIZE OF THE TREE IS ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY FEET IN HEIGHT AND TWELVE TO FOURTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER THE CONES ARE ABOUT FOUR INCHES LONG AND COVERED WITH A SORT OF VARNISH AND GUM RENDERING THEM IMPERVIOUS TO MOISTURE
SINGLY IN WHAT APPEARS AS CHANCE SITUATIONS WITHOUT MAKING MUCH IMPRESSION ON THE GENERAL FOREST CONTINUING UP THROUGH THE FORESTS OF THE TWO LEAVED PINE IT BEGINS TO SHOW ITS DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC IN THE MOST MARKED WAY
TO ANY ONE NOT DESPERATELY TIME POOR THIS TRIP SHOULD HAVE FOUR DAYS INSTEAD OF THREE CAMPING THE SECOND NIGHT AT THE SODA SPRINGS
THEY ARE THE PRIESTS OF PINES AND SEEM EVER TO BE ADDRESSING THE SURROUNDING FOREST THE YELLOW PINE IS FOUND GROWING WITH THEM ON WARM HILLSIDES AND THE SILVER FIR ON COOL NORTHERN SLOPES BUT
CLINGING BY SLIGHT JOINTS TO THE ROCKS LIVING CHIEFLY ON SNOW AND THIN AIR AND MAINTAINING SOUND HEALTH ON THIS DIET FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE EVERY FEATURE OR EVERY GESTURE IT MAKES EXPRESSES STEADFAST DOGGED ENDURANCE
AND AS THE WHOLE MASS BENEATH AND ABOUT ME JOINED IN THE FLIGHT THERE WAS NO FRICTION THOUGH I WAS TOSSED HERE AND THERE AND LURCHED FROM SIDE TO SIDE WHEN THE AVALANCHE SWEDGED AND CAME TO REST
AS IF IT WERE MADE OF SILK SO RARE AND SPLENDID A PICTURE OF COURSE SMOTHERED EVERYTHING ELSE AND I AT ONCE BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE AND WALLOW UP THE SNOW CHOKED INDIAN CANYON
STUDYING THE TREMENDOUS TOPOGRAPHY ET CETERA TRACE THE RIM OF THE VALLEY TO THE GRAND EL CAPITAN RIDGE AND GO DOWN TO ITS BROW WHERE YOU WILL GAIN EVERLASTING IMPRESSIONS OF NATURE'S STEADFASTNESS AND POWER
IN ALL MY MOUNTAINEERING I HAVE ENJOYED ONLY ONE AVALANCHE RIDE AND THE START WAS SO SUDDEN AND THE END CAME SO SOON I HAD BUT LITTLE TIME TO THINK OF THE DANGER THAT ATTENDS THIS SORT OF TRAVEL
AND HUNDREDS OF SMOOTH ROCK WAVES THAT APPEAR TO BE COMING ROLLING ON TOWARDS YOU LIKE HIGH HEAVING WAVES READY TO BREAK
TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY
STILL SWEET AND FRESH IN EVERY FIBER THE TRUNK IS A REMARKABLY SMOOTH ROUND DELICATELY TAPERED SHAFT STRAIGHT AND REGULAR AS IF TURNED IN A LATHE MOSTLY WITHOUT LIMBS
IN CALM SUN DAYS THE SUGAR PINE PREACHES LIKE AN ENTHUSIASTIC APOSTLE WITHOUT MOVING A LEAF ON LEVEL ROCKS THE JUNIPER DIES STANDING AND WASTES INSENSIBLY OUT OF EXISTENCE LIKE GRANITE THE WIND EXERTING ABOUT AS LITTLE CONTROL OVER IT
SOUTHERN SLOPES FROM PEAK TO PEAK LIKE WHITE PEARLY FOG IT APPEARS THEREFORE THAT SHADOWS IN GREAT PART DETERMINE NOT ONLY THE FORMS OF LOFTY ICE MOUNTAINS
THE GRAY PICTURESQUE CATHEDRAL RANGE BOUNDS IT ON THE SOUTH A SIMILAR RANGE OR SPUR THE HIGHEST PEAK OF WHICH IS MOUNT CONNESS ON THE NORTH THE NOBLE MOUNTS DANA GIBBS MAMMOTH LYELL
SMOKE ET CETERA STILL ATTEND STEAM TRAVEL THIS FLIGHT IN WHAT MIGHT BE CALLED A MILKY WAY OF SNOW STARS WAS THE MOST SPIRITUAL AND EXHILARATING OF ALL THE MODES OF MOTION I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED
NORTHWARD LIES YOSEMITE'S WIDE BASIN WITH ITS DOMES AND SMALL LAKES SHINING LIKE LARGER CRYSTALS EASTWARD THE ROCKY
AWAY FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE PREVAILING WINDS ALTHOUGH SO UNCONVENTIONAL WHEN FULL GROWN THE SUGAR PINE IS A REMARKABLY PROPER TREE IN YOUTH A STRICT FOLLOWER OF CONIFEROUS FASHIONS
AND FROM SIX TO EIGHT FEET IN DIAMETER FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND THOUGH SOME GRAND OLD PATRIARCH MAY BE MET HERE AND THERE THAT HAS ENJOYED SIX OR EIGHT CENTURIES OF STORMS AND ATTAINED A THICKNESS OF TEN OR EVEN TWELVE FEET
SAUNTERING UP THE VALLEY THROUGH MEADOW AND GROVE IN THE COMPANY OF THESE MAJESTIC ROCKS WHICH SEEM TO FOLLOW US AS WE ADVANCE GAZING ADMIRING LOOKING FOR NEW WONDERS AHEAD WHERE ALL ABOUT US IS SO WONDERFUL
MAKING A VERTICAL DESCENT IN ALL OF ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FEET JUST BEYOND THE DOME CASCADES ON THE SHOULDER OF MOUNT WATKINS THERE IS AN OLD TRAIL ONCE USED BY INDIANS ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RANGE TO MONO BUT IN THE CANYON ABOVE THIS POINT
ENTERING THE VALLEY GAZING OVERWHELMED WITH THE MULTITUDE OF GRAND OBJECTS ABOUT US PERHAPS THE FIRST TO FIX OUR ATTENTION WILL BE THE BRIDAL VEIL A BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL ON OUR RIGHT ITS BROW
SEVERELY SIMPLE GLACIER SCULPTURED FACE OF GRANITE THE END OF ONE OF THE MOST COMPACT AND ENDURING OF THE MOUNTAIN RIDGES UNRIVALED IN HEIGHT AND BREADTH AND FLAWLESS STRENGTH
THE MOUNTAIN PINE PINUS MONTICOLA IS THE NOBLEST TREE OF THE ALPINE ZONE HARDY AND LONG LIVED TOWERING GRANDLY ABOVE ITS COMPANIONS AND BECOMING STRONGER AND MORE IMPOSING
NOW DIVING UNDER WILLOWS AND LAVING THEIR RED ROOTS OOZING THROUGH GREEN PLUSHY BOGS PLASHING OVER SMALL FALLS AND DANCING DOWN SLANTING CASCADES CALMING AGAIN GLIDING THROUGH PATCHES OF SMOOTH GLACIER MEADOWS
THAT ARE FROM TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OLD STILL HOLDING BRAVELY TO LIFE MAKING THE MOST OF THEIR SLENDER SUMMERS SHAKING THEIR TASSELED NEEDLES IN THE BREEZE RIGHT CHEERILY
MY YOUNG MEN BELIEVED THAT THE GOLD DIGGERS WERE OUR ENEMIES
TO THE MAJOR SAVAGE FIRMLY SAID YOUR PEOPLE MUST GO TO THE COMMISSIONERS IF THEY DO NOT YOUR YOUNG MEN WILL AGAIN STEAL HORSES AND KILL AND PLUNDER THE WHITES
STRANGE TO SAY AMID ALL THIS ARCTIC REPRESSION THE MOUNTAIN PINE ON LEDGES AND BUTTRESSES OF RED MOUNTAIN SEEMS TO FIND THE CLIMATE BEST SUITED TO IT
WHICH NO ONE WOULD HAVE BELIEVED POSSIBLE IF HE HAD HEARD OF IT BEFORE IT HAD COME TO PASS FOR COULD ANY ONE HAVE IMAGINED THAT EVEN WHEN BESIEGED BY THE PELOPONNESIANS ENTRENCHED IN ATTICA THEY WOULD STILL INSTEAD OF WITHDRAWING FROM SICILY
AND THUS DID HIS BEST TO PUT DOWN PIRACY IN THOSE WATERS A NECESSARY STEP TO SECURE THE REVENUES FOR HIS OWN USE
AND THE TOWN WOULD ALSO BE USEFUL AS A STATION ON THE ROAD TO THRACE IN SHORT EVERYTHING MADE THE LACEDAEMONIANS EAGER TO FOUND THE PLACE AFTER FIRST CONSULTING THE GOD AT DELPHI AND RECEIVING A FAVOURABLE ANSWER THEY SENT OFF THE COLONISTS SPARTANS AND PERIOECI
WHEN BOTH SIDES WERE READY THEY JOINED BATTLE DEMOSTHENES BEING ON THE RIGHT WING WITH THE MESSENIANS AND A FEW ATHENIANS WHILE THE REST OF THE LINE WAS MADE UP OF THE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS OF THE ACARNANIANS
HOW ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT FROM YOURSELVES THE ATHENIANS ARE ADDICTED TO INNOVATION AND THEIR DESIGNS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY SWIFTNESS ALIKE IN CONCEPTION AND EXECUTION YOU HAVE A GENIUS FOR KEEPING WHAT YOU HAVE GOT ACCOMPANIED BY A TOTAL WANT OF INVENTION
PARTICULARLY AT ORCHOMENUS IN THE LAST NAMED COUNTRY
PISISTRATUS WAS REALLY SUPREME
WHO HAD FURNISHED THEM WITH THE DARTERS ARRIVED AT METAPONTIUM IN ITALY HERE THEY PERSUADED THEIR ALLIES THE METAPONTINES TO SEND WITH THEM THREE HUNDRED DARTERS AND TWO GALLEYS AND WITH THIS REINFORCEMENT COASTED ON TO THURII
THE ATHENIAN RIGHT MADE A BETTER STAND
THE NEXT SUMMER THE TRUCE FOR A YEAR ENDED AFTER LASTING UNTIL THE PYTHIAN GAMES DURING THE ARMISTICE THE ATHENIANS EXPELLED THE DELIANS FROM DELOS
MOST OF THE PELOPONNESE ARCADIA EXCEPTED AND THE MOST FERTILE PARTS OF THE REST OF HELLAS THE GOODNESS OF THE LAND FAVOURED THE AGGRANDIZEMENT OF PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS AND THUS CREATED FACTION WHICH PROVED A FERTILE SOURCE OF RUIN
WHO NOT ONLY ROUTED THE SQUADRON IN QUESTION BUT ALSO THAT BY WHICH THEY WERE AT FIRST BEING DEFEATED IN THE HARBOUR SINKING ELEVEN OF THE SYRACUSAN VESSELS AND KILLING MOST OF THE MEN EXCEPT THE CREWS OF THREE SHIPS WHOM THEY MADE PRISONERS
AND HELLAS BEGAN TO FIT OUT FLEETS AND APPLY HERSELF MORE CLOSELY TO THE SEA IT IS SAID THAT THE CORINTHIANS WERE THE FIRST TO APPROACH THE MODERN STYLE OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE AND THAT CORINTH WAS THE FIRST PLACE IN HELLAS WHERE GALLEYS WERE BUILT
DATING FROM THE SAME TIME PLANTED ON AN ISTHMUS CORINTH HAD FROM TIME OUT OF MIND BEEN A COMMERCIAL EMPORIUM AS FORMERLY ALMOST ALL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE HELLENES WITHIN AND WITHOUT PELOPONNESE WAS CARRIED ON OVERLAND
WHEN THE ATHENIANS HAD HEARD IT THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT HIS RESIGNATION BUT CHOSE HIM TWO COLLEAGUES
HIMSELF ALSO SENT TO ATHENS HE HAD BEFORE SENT FREQUENT REPORTS OF EVENTS AS THEY OCCURRED AND FELT IT ESPECIALLY INCUMBENT UPON HIM TO DO SO NOW AS HE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE IN A CRITICAL POSITION AND THAT UNLESS SPEEDILY RECALLED
THE ATHENIANS QUICKLY MANNED SIXTY SHIPS AND WITH TWENTY FIVE OF THESE ENGAGED THE THIRTY FIVE OF THE SYRACUSANS IN THE GREAT HARBOUR SENDING THE REST TO MEET THOSE SAILING ROUND FROM THE ARSENAL
THIS WAS THE FIRST AND CHIEF OCCASION OF THE LOSSES WHICH THE CREWS EXPERIENCED THE WATER WHICH THEY USED WAS SCARCE AND HAD TO BE FETCHED FROM FAR
INDEED THIS WAS BY FAR THE GREATEST DISASTER THAT BEFELL ANY ONE HELLENIC CITY IN AN EQUAL NUMBER OF DAYS DURING THIS WAR
AND FIRST TELL US IF THIS PROPOSITION OF OURS SUITS YOU THE MELIAN COMMISSIONERS ANSWERED MELIANS TO THE FAIRNESS OF QUIETLY INSTRUCTING EACH OTHER AS YOU PROPOSE
THE AMBRACIOTS HAVING COME AND URGED THEM TO COMBINE WITH THEM IN ATTACKING AMPHILOCHIAN ARGOS AND THE REST OF AMPHILOCHIA AND ACARNANIA AFFIRMING THAT THE CONQUEST OF THESE COUNTRIES WOULD BRING ALL THE CONTINENT INTO ALLIANCE WITH LACEDAEMON
VARIOUS TOO WERE THE OBSTACLES WHICH THE NATIONAL GROWTH ENCOUNTERED IN VARIOUS LOCALITIES THE POWER OF THE IONIANS WAS ADVANCING WITH RAPID STRIDES WHEN IT CAME INTO COLLISION WITH PERSIA UNDER KING CYRUS WHO AFTER HAVING DETHRONED CROESUS
FOR THEY HOPE BY THEIR ABSENCE TO EXTEND THEIR ACQUISITIONS YOU FEAR BY YOUR ADVANCE TO ENDANGER WHAT YOU HAVE LEFT BEHIND THEY ARE SWIFT TO FOLLOW UP A SUCCESS AND SLOW TO RECOIL FROM A REVERSE THEIR BODIES THEY SPEND UNGRUDGINGLY IN THEIR COUNTRY'S CAUSE
AND ALSO FELL IN WITH SOME LOCRIAN SETTLERS EXILED FROM MESSINA WHO HAD BEEN SENT THITHER WHEN THE LOCRIANS WERE CALLED IN BY ONE OF THE FACTIONS THAT DIVIDED MESSINA AFTER THE PACIFICATION OF SICILY
WITHOUT ANY FORCE OF YOURS WORTHY OF THE NAME ADVANCING TO MEET HIM BUT THIS WAS A DISTANT ENEMY WELL ATHENS AT ALL EVENTS IS A NEAR NEIGHBOUR AND YET ATHENS YOU UTTERLY DISREGARD
WHOM THE ATHENIANS FORTHWITH LODGED IN THE NEIGHBOURING ISLANDS OF THEIR EMPIRE THE ATHENIANS ALSO MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE ISLE OF MELOS WITH THIRTY SHIPS OF THEIR OWN
FROM THE REST OF HELLAS TOOK REFUGE WITH THE ATHENIANS AS A SAFE RETREAT AND AT AN EARLY PERIOD BECOMING NATURALIZED SWELLED THE ALREADY LARGE POPULATION OF THE CITY TO SUCH A HEIGHT THAT ATTICA BECAME AT LAST TOO SMALL TO HOLD THEM
MEANWHILE THE SYRACUSANS SENT EMBASSIES TO THE CITIES COMPOSED OF CORINTHIANS AMBRACIOTS AND LACEDAEMONIANS
IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONG AND THAT IF WE DO NOT MOLEST THEM IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID SO THAT BESIDES EXTENDING OUR EMPIRE WE SHOULD GAIN IN SECURITY BY YOUR SUBJECTION
IN DEALING WITH FOREIGN POLITICS TIME AFTER TIME WAS OUR VOICE RAISED TO WARN YOU OF THE BLOWS ABOUT TO BE DEALT US BY ATHENS AND TIME AFTER TIME INSTEAD OF TAKING THE TROUBLE TO ASCERTAIN THE WORTH OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS
LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS AND COMMIT THEMSELVES TO THE DISCRETION OF THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE THE GENERALS CARRIED THEM ACROSS UNDER TRUCE TO THE ISLAND OF PTYCHIA
NIGHT CAME ON WHILE THESE HORRORS WERE ENACTING AND MOST OF IT HAD PASSED BEFORE THEY WERE CONCLUDED
WHERE EURYLOCHUS AND HIS MEN CONFRONTED THE MESSENIANS AND DEMOSTHENES THE PELOPONNESIANS WERE NOW WELL ENGAGED AND WITH THEIR OUTFLANKING WING WERE UPON THE POINT OF TURNING THEIR ENEMY'S RIGHT
AND GOING ON BOARD CROSSED OVER TO THE ISLANDS OPPOSITE AND FROM THENCE SENT A HERALD AND TOOK UP UNDER TRUCE THE BODIES WHICH THEY HAD LEFT BEHIND TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE CORINTHIANS FELL IN THE BATTLE AND RATHER LESS THAN FIFTY ATHENIANS
IN FRONT OF WHAT IS NOW THE MARKETPLACE AND THE AMPHIPOLITANS HAVING ENCLOSED HIS TOMB EVER AFTERWARDS SACRIFICE TO HIM AS A HERO AND HAVE GIVEN TO HIM THE HONOUR OF GAMES AND ANNUAL OFFERINGS
ON OTHER BUSINESS ON HEARING THE SPEECHES THEY THOUGHT THEMSELVES CALLED UPON TO COME BEFORE THE LACEDAEMONIANS
AND THE CORINTHIAN TERRITORY WAS THE HIGHWAY THROUGH WHICH IT TRAVELLED SHE HAD CONSEQUENTLY GREAT MONEY RESOURCES AS IS SHOWN BY THE EPITHET WEALTHY BESTOWED BY THE OLD POETS ON THE PLACE AND THIS ENABLED HER WHEN TRAFFIC BY SEA BECAME MORE COMMON
WITHOUT ITS BEING LOST IN TRANSMISSION AND BE ABLE TO DECIDE UPON THE REAL FACTS OF THE CASE HIS EMISSARIES ACCORDINGLY DEPARTED WITH THE LETTER AND THE REQUISITE VERBAL INSTRUCTIONS AND HE ATTENDED TO THE AFFAIRS OF THE ARMY
BUT ARE COMPELLED TO DEPEND BOTH FOR SUPPLYING THE CREWS IN SERVICE
WITH HONOUR AS THE PRIZE AND SHAME AS THE PENALTY BUT A QUESTION OF SELF PRESERVATION AND OF NOT RESISTING THOSE WHO ARE FAR STRONGER THAN YOU ARE MELIANS
AND SENT FOR TROOPS TO THE ALLIES AND MEANWHILE GOT TOGETHER MONEY SHIPS AND HEAVY INFANTRY AT HOME THE ATHENIANS ALSO SENT TWENTY VESSELS ROUND PELOPONNESE TO PREVENT ANY ONE CROSSING OVER TO SICILY FROM CORINTH OR PELOPONNESE
SET SAIL WITH TWO COLLEAGUES AS AMBASSADOR FROM ATHENS TO ITALY AND SICILY
TO BE TOLD THE BEST SIDE OF THINGS AND THEN TO BLAME THE TELLER IF THE EXPECTATIONS WHICH HE HAS RAISED IN YOUR MINDS ARE NOT ANSWERED BY THE RESULT AND I THEREFORE THOUGHT IT SAFEST TO DECLARE TO YOU THE TRUTH
WHICH WAS INDEED THE ONLY WAY PRACTICABLE THIS HOWEVER NOT BEING QUICK ENOUGH FOR HIM HE JOINED THE RETREAT IN PERSON AND MADE THE RIGHT WING WHEEL ROUND THUS TURNING ITS UNARMED SIDE TO THE ENEMY
AND ISLANDERS WITH THE MOTLEY RABBLE THAT ACCOMPANIED THEM AND OF DRIVING THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY AFTER THIS HE EMBRACED THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT OFFERED OF AGAIN LEADING THEM AGAINST THE ENEMY
LED THEM AGAINST MYCALESSUS THE NIGHT HE PASSED UNOBSERVED NEAR THE TEMPLE OF HERMES NOT QUITE TWO MILES FROM MYCALESSUS AND AT DAYBREAK ASSAULTED AND TOOK THE TOWN WHICH IS NOT A LARGE ONE THE INHABITANTS BEING OFF THEIR GUARD AND NOT EXPECTING THAT ANY ONE WOULD EVER COME UP
WHICH HAD JUST LANDED IN FRONT OF CHERSONESE AND AFTERWARDS THE REST OF THE ARMY THE BATTLE WAS AN OBSTINATE ONE AND FOUGHT THROUGHOUT HAND TO HAND THE RIGHT WING OF THE ATHENIANS AND CARYSTIANS
AND SO TO PROCEED WITHOUT DELAY TO SICILY WHILE CHARICLES WAITED UNTIL HE HAD COMPLETED THE FORTIFICATION OF THE PLACE AND LEAVING A GARRISON THERE RETURNED HOME SUBSEQUENTLY WITH HIS THIRTY SHIPS AND THE ARGIVES ALSO
INVOKE THY FAVOUR ON EACH MANLY GAME AND DANCE AND SING IN HONOUR OF THY NAME THAT THERE WAS ALSO A POETICAL CONTEST IN WHICH THE IONIANS WENT TO CONTEND AGAIN IS SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING TAKEN FROM THE SAME HYMN
THANKS FOR YOUR COURTESY REPLIED SIMON WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ASKED THE THIEF TO THE MARKET WAS THE REPLY AND WHAT DID YOU BUY THERE CONTINUED THE ROGUE THIS MULE WHICH MULE
BUT SHE WAS NOT ANY MORE SUCCESSFUL LOOK ROUND AS SHE MIGHT THE GOLDEN APPLES BENT THEMSELVES BACK AT LAST THE MOTHER GOT IMPATIENT AND CLIMBED UP HERSELF
WHERE HE AND THE PRINCESS WERE MARRIED AND HE LIVED WITH HER MANY YEARS AS HAPPY AND MERRY AS A LARK
SHE FOUND A LITTLE EARTHENWARE DISH WITH THE FOOD THAT HER SISTERS HAD THROWN TO HER BUT SHE DID NOT TOUCH IT THE NEXT DAY SHE WENT OUT AGAIN WITH HER GOAT
SURCANTINE CAME IN ALL HASTE TO SEE WHAT SHE COULD DO FOR HER DARLING BUT HE REJECTED WITH SCORN ALL THE PORTRAITS OF LOVELY PRINCESSES WHICH SHE OFFERED HIM FOR HIS COLLECTION IN SHORT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS IN A BAD WAY
SWAM ABOUT IN THE WATER NOT FAR FROM THE SHORE PRINCE MILAN NOTICED THIRTY LITTLE WHITE GARMENTS LYING ON THE GRASS AND DISMOUNTING FROM HIS HORSE HE CREPT DOWN UNDER THE HIGH BULRUSHES TOOK ONE OF THE GARMENTS
AND THE TWO ELDER THOUGHT THAT AFTER HAVING SUCCESSFULLY PUT IN SO MANY FINE AND STRONG STITCHES WITH NEVER A WRONG ONE AMONGST THEM THEY WERE CERTAIN TO DO THE RIGHT THING HERE TOO THE THIRD TAILOR WAS A LAZY YOUNG SCAMP WHO DID NOT EVEN KNOW HIS OWN TRADE PROPERLY
RODE ON A COCK AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN A HORSE AND IT MADE LOVELY MUSIC BUT AS IT CERTAINLY COULD NOT READ HE HAD JUST WRITTEN THAT HE WOULD NOT GIVE IT ANYTHING AT ALL AT THIS THE PRINCESS WAS QUITE PLEASED AND SAID HOW CLEVERLY HER FATHER HAD MANAGED FOR THAT OF COURSE
I WILL ONLY LET YOU GO ON CONDITION THAT YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT AND WHICH YOU WILL FIND ON YOUR RETURN HOME THE KING DIDN'T PAUSE TO PONDER LONG FOR WHAT THOUGHT HE
COME WE WILL GO HOME SO THEY WENT HOME AND LITTLE TWO EYES AGAIN LEFT HER LITTLE DISH UNTOUCHED AND LITTLE ONE EYE COULD NOT TELL HER MOTHER WHY SHE WOULD NOT EAT AND SAID AS AN EXCUSE I WAS SO SLEEPY OUT OF DOORS THE NEXT DAY
AND WHEN HE HAD DONE JACK MY HEDGEHOG POINTED OUT THE WAY AND THE KING GOT SAFELY HOME NOW WHEN THE KING'S DAUGHTER SAW HER FATHER RETURNING IN THE DISTANCE SHE WAS SO DELIGHTED THAT SHE RAN TO MEET HIM AND THREW HERSELF INTO HIS ARMS
WOULD GIVE HIM HIS WRITTEN PROMISE TO LET HIM HAVE WHATEVER FIRST MET HIM ON HIS RETURN THE KING THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT'S EASY ENOUGH TO PROMISE THE CREATURE WON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD ABOUT IT SO I CAN JUST WRITE WHAT I CHOOSE
THERE HE STOOD THINKING AND WONDERING WHAT HE COULD DO WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE SAW THREE FISHES SWIMMING ALONG AND RECOGNISED THEM AS THE VERY SAME WHOSE LIVES HE HAD SAVED
WITHIN REACH OF HIS CLAWS THE TAILOR HOWEVER HAD NO NOTION OF BEING SCARED BUT SAID CHEERILY BRAVELY DARED IS HALF WON WHEN EVENING CAME ON HE WAS TAKEN TO THE STABLE
BECAUSE SHE HAD A LITTLE PINK ROSE PRINTED UPON HER WHITE THROAT FROM HER EARLIEST INFANCY SHE HAD SHOWN THE MOST ASTONISHING INTELLIGENCE AND THE COURTIERS KNEW HER SMART SAYINGS BY HEART AND REPEATED THEM ON ALL OCCASIONS
THE HAUGHTY PRINCESS HOWEVER ON HEARING THAT HE WAS NOT HER EQUAL BY BIRTH DESPISED HIM AND EXACTED THE FULFILMENT OF A SECOND TASK SHE WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND WITH HER OWN HANDS
THE YOUNGEST WENT BY HIMSELF ALONG HIS LONELY WAY BUT THIS TIME HE FELT MUCH MORE CHEERFUL HARDLY HAD HE SAT DOWN UNDER THE BRIDGE AND HEAVED A SIGH THAN PUDDOCKY CAME OUT AND SITTING DOWN OPPOSITE HIM ASKED WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU NOW DEAR PRINCE
THE ARTFUL WOMAN WHO AT ONCE UNDERSTOOD HER MASTER ANSWERED CERTAINLY I HAVE THE VEAL IS ROASTED AND THE CHICKENS BOILED THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID SIMON WHEN THE THREE ROGUES SAW THE COOKED MEATS AND THE TART IN THE OVEN AND HEARD NINA'S WORDS
AND WITHOUT OPENING IT ONE OF THEM SEIZED IT AND THREW IT INTO THE RIVER AND SO THE POOR SHEPHERD WAS DROWNED INSTEAD OF MISTER SIMON THE THREE ROGUES HAVING WREAKED THEIR VENGEANCE SET OUT FOR HOME ON THEIR WAY THEY NOTICED A FLOCK OF SHEEP GRAZING NOT FAR FROM THE ROAD
SOME MEAT AND A COUPLE OF BIG LOAVES FOR THE HOUSE SAID SHE THEN HE ASKED THE MAID WHAT SHE WANTED AND SHE SAID A PAIR OF SLIPPERS AND SOME STOCKINGS LASTLY HE SAID
MERE CHILD'S PLAY REPLIED THE TAILOR LOOK HERE YOU PRESS THE STRINGS WITH THE FINGERS OF THE LEFT HAND AND WITH THE RIGHT YOU DRAW THE BOW ACROSS THEM SO THEN IT GOES AS EASILY AS POSSIBLE UP AND DOWN
WHEN OF COURSE THEY ARE LIABLE TO ACCIDENT
AND ONCE MORE ADDRESSED HIS SONS THE TWO MOST DIFFICULT TASKS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED NOW LISTEN TO THE THIRD AND LAST WHOEVER BRINGS THE FAIREST WIFE HOME WITH HIM SHALL BE MY HEIR
SHE HAD TO GIVE A FULL ACCOUNT OF HOW SHE HAD STOLEN ROSANELLA FROM HER CRADLE AND DIVIDED HER CHARACTER INTO TWELVE PARTS THAT EACH MIGHT CHARM PRINCE MIRLIFLOR
BUT BECAUSE LITTLE TWO EYES DID NOT LOOK ANY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CHILDREN
ROUND THE SAME CORNER BUT COMING TOWARDS HIM THERE APPEARED A BEAUTIFUL COACH DRAWN BY SIX SPLENDID HORSES WITH OUTRIDERS COACHMEN FOOTMEN AND OTHER SERVANTS ALL IN THE MOST GORGEOUS LIVERIES
IMAGINE HIS FEELINGS WHEN HE ARRIVED AND WAS PRESENTED AT ONCE TO TWELVE OF THE LOVELIEST CREATURES IN THE WORLD AND HIS EMBARRASSMENT WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT THEY ALL LIKED HIM AS MUCH AS HE LIKED EACH ONE OF THEM
BUT HE SET OFF DETERMINED TO WALK AS FAR AS HIS LEGS WOULD CARRY HIM THOUGH HE HAD NO HOPE OF EVER FINDING IT AFTER JOURNEYING THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT KINGDOMS HE REACHED A WOOD ONE NIGHT
WHY THAT IS THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD NOT SO EASY AS YOU THINK CRIED THE LITTLE BEE WHO WAS FLYING PAST IF I WEREN'T TO HELP YOU YOU'D NEVER GUESS WE ARE THIRTY SISTERS SO EXACTLY ALIKE
HOWEVER IT BECAME ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD PAY HIS RESPECTS AND HE HAD SCARCELY BEEN FIVE MINUTES IN HER PRESENCE BEFORE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE COMBINED IN HER OWN CHARMING PERSON ALL THE GIFTS AND GRACES
IT HAPPENED ONE DAY THAT WHEN THEY WERE ALL STANDING TOGETHER BY THE TREE THAT A YOUNG KNIGHT CAME RIDING ALONG BE QUICK LITTLE TWO EYES CRIED THE TWO SISTERS CREEP UNDER THIS SO THAT YOU SHALL NOT DISGRACE US
IF YOU RETURN WITHOUT IT YOU WILL BE THROWN BACK INTO THE LAKE TIME AFTER TIME TILL YOU ARE DROWNED IN ITS DEPTHS EVERYONE FELT SORRY FOR THE HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW AND LEFT HIM ALONE ON THE SHORE
YOU'RE A NICE SORT OF FELLOW SAID THE TAILOR THE IDEA OF HAVING THOSE GREAT JAWS AND NOT BEING ABLE EVEN TO CRACK A WALNUT SO HE TOOK THE STONE QUICKLY CHANGED IT FOR A NUT AND CRACK IT SPLIT OPEN IN A MOMENT
HYACINTHIA PRINCE MILAN WENT PAST THEM AND LOOKED AT THEM CLOSELY BUT THEY WERE ALL SO PRECISELY ALIKE THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE ONE FACE REFLECTED IN THIRTY MIRRORS
THERE WAS NO LACK OF SOCIETY AT OUR HOME FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS PAID US FREQUENT VISITS AND WE KEPT OPEN HOUSE FOR ALL THUS IT HAPPENED THAT ONE EVENING A STRANGER RODE UP TO THE CASTLE AND ASKED FOR HOSPITALITY AS HE COULD NOT REACH THE NEAREST TOWN THAT NIGHT
WHERE THE WHITE APRONED COOKS WERE RUNNING ABOUT IN GREAT CONFUSION THE PRINCESS WENT UP TO THE HEAD COOK AND SAID DEAR COOK PLEASE LISTEN TO MY REQUEST AND LET ME MAKE A WEDDING CAKE FOR PRINCE MILAN
AND ASKED WHERE THEY CAME FROM LITTLE ONE EYE AND LITTLE THREE EYES ANSWERED THAT THEY HAD ANOTHER SISTER BUT SHE COULD NOT BE SEEN BECAUSE SHE HAD ONLY TWO EYES LIKE ORDINARY PEOPLE BUT THE KNIGHT DEMANDED TO SEE HER AND CALLED OUT LITTLE TWO EYES COME FORTH
AND TO GIVE HIM A WARM WELCOME WITH HIS GREAT PAWS GENTLY GENTLY SAID THE TAILOR I'LL SOON TEACH YOU TO BE QUIET AND HE COOLLY DREW A HANDFUL OF WALNUTS FROM HIS POCKET AND BEGAN CRACKING AND EATING THEM
TRA LA LA LA LA OH CRIED THE BEAR I DO WISH I COULD PLAY LIKE THAT THEN I COULD DANCE WHENEVER THE FANCY TOOK ME WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD YOU GIVE ME SOME LESSONS WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE TAILOR
AND IN HIS RAGE HE THRUST HIS KNIFE INTO HER BREAST SO THAT SHE FELL DEAD ON THE GROUND THEN HE TOOK SIMON'S PIPE AND BLEW INTO IT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN THE HOPES OF CALLING HIS WIFE BACK TO LIFE BUT HE BLEW IN VAIN FOR THE POOR SOUL WAS AS DEAD AS A DOOR NAIL
AND IF YOU DRIVE HIM PROPERLY TO GET GRASS BUT LITTLE TWO EYES KNEW WHAT LITTLE THREE EYES HAD IN HER MIND
HE WAS HUNTED OUT OF THE TOWN WITH SCORN AND DERISION SHE GAVE OUT PUBLICLY THAT ALL COMERS WERE WELCOME TO TRY THEIR SKILL AND THAT WHOEVER COULD SOLVE HER RIDDLE SHOULD BE HER HUSBAND NOW IT HAPPENED THAT THREE TAILORS HAD MET TOGETHER
AND SNOW IN EVERY FORM ABOVE THEM AND THE GREAT DOWN PLUNGING GRANITE BUTTRESSES AND HEADLANDS OF THE WALLS MARVELOUS IN BOLD MASSIVE SCULPTURE FORESTS IN SIDE CANYONS TO WITHIN FIFTY FEET OF THE GLACIER AVALANCHE PATHWAYS OVERGROWN WITH ALDER AND WILLOW
JUST BELOW A NARROW GORGE CALLED THE CANYON TERRACES FIRST MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE WHERE GREAT QUANTITIES OF MORAINE MATERIAL HAVE BEEN SWEPT THROUGH THE FLOOD CHOKED GORGE AND OF COURSE OUTSPREAD
THE CAPTAIN KINDLY LOANED ME HIS CANOE AND TWO OF HIS INDIAN DECK HANDS WHO SEEMED MUCH PUZZLED TO KNOW WHAT THE RARE SERVICE REQUIRED OF THEM MIGHT MEAN AND ON LEAVING BADE A MERRY ADIEU TO THEIR COMPANIONS WE CAMPED ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE RIVER OPPOSITE
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT INTERRUPTED BY SHEER PRECIPICES I CONCLUDED THAT WITH GREAT CARE AND THE DIGGING OF SLIGHT FOOTHOLDS HE COULD BE SLID DOWN TO THE GLACIER WHERE I COULD LAY HIM ON HIS BACK AND PERHAPS BE ABLE TO SET HIS ARMS
INNUMERABLE CASCADES KEEPING UP A SOLEMN HARMONY OF WATER SOUNDS BLENDING WITH THOSE OF THE GLACIER MOULINS AND RILLS AND AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN REACH TRIBUTARY GLACIERS AT SHORT INTERVALS SILENTLY DESCENDING FROM THEIR HIGH
WHICH ENTERED THE MAIN CANYON FROM EITHER SIDE AND THAT ON ONE OCCASION AN INDIAN ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF HIS WIFE HAD HER SENT ADRIFT IN A CANOE DOWN THROUGH THE ICE TUNNEL EXPECTING THAT SHE WOULD TROUBLE HIM NO MORE
BUT EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUSLY FRESH AND I FOUND NEW AND OLD PLANT FRIENDS AND LESSONS ON NATURE'S ALASKA MORAINE LANDSCAPE GARDENING THAT MADE EVERYTHING BRIGHT AND LIGHT IT WAS NOW NEAR DARK
AND SO SHOULDERING MY BUNDLE I TRUDGED OFF THROUGH THE MORAINE BOULDERS AND THICKETS MY GENERAL PLAN WAS TO TRACE THE TERMINAL MORAINE TO ITS EXTREME NORTH END PITCH MY LITTLE TENT
BUT TO HIS SURPRISE SHE FLOATED THROUGH UNDER THE ICE IN SAFETY ALL THE EVIDENCE CONNECTED WITH THE PRESENT APPEARANCE OF THESE TWO GLACIERS INDICATES THAT THEY WERE UNITED AND FORMED A DAM ACROSS THE RIVER
GLIDING ALONG THE SWIFT FLOWING RIVER THE VIEWS CHANGE WITH BEWILDERING RAPIDITY WONDERFUL TOO ARE THE CHANGES DEPENDENT ON THE SEASONS AND THE WEATHER IN SPRING WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST
BEYOND THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE TERRITORY GASHED BY STUPENDOUS CANYONS
DEPEND IN MASSIVE BULGING CURVES AND SWELLS AND GRADUATE INTO THE RIVER LIKE FORMS THAT MAZE THROUGH THE LOWER FORESTED REGIONS AND ARE SO STRIKING AND BEAUTIFUL THAT THEY ARE ADMIRED EVEN BY THE PASSING MINERS
YOU ENJOY THE COUNTLESS REJOICING WATERFALLS THE GENTLE BREATHING OF WARM WINDS THE COLORS OF THE YOUNG LEAVES AND FLOWERS WHEN THE BEES ARE BUSY AND WAFTS OF FRAGRANCE ARE DRIFTING HITHER AND THITHER
OF THOSE DEEP ACCUMULATIONS OF MOSSES LEAVES AND DECAYING TRUNKS WHICH MAKE SO DAMP AND UNCLEARABLE MASS IN THE COAST FORESTS
INTO WHICH I CRAWLED AND ENJOYED THE NOVEL AND INSTRUCTIVE VIEW OF A GLACIER POURING OVER MY HEAD SHOWING NOT ONLY ITS GRINDING POLISHING ACTION BUT HOW IT BREAKS OFF LARGE ANGULAR BOULDER MASSES A MOST TELLING LESSON IN EARTH SCULPTURE
WITH GOLD DUST IN THEIR EYES THIRTY FIVE MILES ABOVE THE BIG STICKEEN GLACIER IS THE DIRT GLACIER THE SECOND IN SIZE ITS OUTLET IS A FINE STREAM ABOUNDING IN TROUT
PICEA SITCHENSIS TSUGA HETEROPHYLLA AND T MERTENSIANA WITH A FEW SPECIMENS OF YELLOW CYPRESS THE FERNS WERE DEVELOPED IN REMARKABLE BEAUTY AND SIZE ASPIDIUMS
GRADUATING INTO OPEN SILVERY FIELDS OF LIGHT AND LOFTY HEADLANDS WITH FINE ARCHING INSTEPS DIPPING THEIR FEET IN THE SHINING WATER
AND THE GLACIER WAS REACHED PERHAPS ABOUT MIDNIGHT HERE I TOOK OFF ONE OF MY BOOTS TIED A HANDKERCHIEF AROUND HIS WRIST FOR A GOOD HOLD
ON THE OLDER PORTIONS OF THIS MORAINE I DISCOVERED SEVERAL KETTLES IN PROCESS OF FORMATION AND WAS PLEASED TO FIND THAT THEY CONFORMED IN THE MOST STRIKING WAY WITH THE THEORY
WHOSE OUTLET IS THROUGH A CHANNEL OR CHANNELS BENEATH THE DAMMING GLACIER NOW THESE SUB CHANNELS ARE OCCASIONALLY BLOCKED AND THE WATER RISES UNTIL IT FLOWS ALONGSIDE OF THE GLACIER BUT AS THE DAM IS A MOVING ONE
THE INDIANS HAD GONE OFF PICKING BERRIES BUT WERE ON THE WATCH FOR ME AND HAILED ME AS I APPROACHED THE CAPTAIN HAD CALLED FOR ME AND AFTER WAITING THREE HOURS DEPARTED FOR WRANGELL WITHOUT LEAVING ANY FOOD
IN THIS PARTICULAR WE FAILED HOWEVER
I REACHED UP TOOK HOLD OF HIM BY ONE OF HIS FEET AND GENTLY SLID HIM DOWN ON HIS BACK
I HAD MY SUPPER BEFORE LEAVING THE STEAMER SO I HAD ONLY TO MAKE A CAMPFIRE SPREAD MY BLANKET AND LIE DOWN THE INDIANS HAD THEIR OWN BEDDING AND LAY BESIDE THEIR OWN FIRE
THE LOG BRIDGE I CROSSED WAS I THINK THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THE KIND I EVER SAW THE MASSIVE LOG IS PLUSHED TO A DEPTH OF SIX INCHES OR MORE WITH MOSSES OF THREE OR FOUR SPECIES
OF FORM AND SCULPTURE AND ARE WONDERFULLY ADORNED AND ENLIVENED WITH GLACIERS AND WATERFALLS WHILE THROUGHOUT ALMOST ITS WHOLE EXTENT THE FLOOR IS A FLOWERY LANDSCAPE GARDEN LIKE YOSEMITE
THE ROCKS ALSO AND THE GLACIERS SEEM TO BLOOM LIKE THE PLANTS IN THE MELLOW GOLDEN LIGHT AND SO GOES THE SONG CHANGE SUCCEEDING CHANGE IN SUBLIME HARMONY THROUGH ALL THE WONDERFUL SEASONS AND WEATHER
FORGOTTEN NOW WERE THE CHILCATS AND MISSIONS WHILE THE WORD OF GOD WAS BEING READ IN THESE MAJESTIC HIEROGLYPHICS BLAZONED ALONG THE SKY THE EARNEST CHILDISH WONDERMENT WITH WHICH THIS GLORIOUS PAGE OF NATURE'S BIBLE WAS CONTEMPLATED
A GRAND OUTBURST IS SOMETIMES MADE WHICH DRAINING THE LARGE LAKE PRODUCES A FLOOD OF AMAZING POWER SWEEPING DOWN IMMENSE QUANTITIES OF MORAINE MATERIAL AND RAISING THE RIVER ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ITS MOUTH
YES ARE THOSE BLUISH DRAGGLED MASSES HANGING DOWN FROM BENEATH THE SNOW FIELDS WHAT YOU CALL THE SNOUTS OF THE GLACIERS YES WHAT MADE THE HOLLOWS THEY ARE IN THE GLACIERS THEMSELVES
IN THE CABIN TO CONSIDER WHAT HAD BETTER BE DONE IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT FOLLOWED MUCH INDIGNATION AND ECONOMY WERE BROUGHT TO LIGHT WE HAD CHARTERED THE BOAT FOR SIXTY DOLLARS PER DAY AND THE ROUND TRIP WAS TO HAVE BEEN MADE IN FOUR OR FIVE DAYS
ATE BISCUITS AND A PIECE OF DRIED SALMON WITHOUT ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A TEA FIRE FILLED A BAG WITH HARDTACK SLUNG IT OVER MY SHOULDER AND WITH MY INDISPENSABLE ICE AXE PLUNGED ONCE MORE INTO THE DRIPPING JUNGLE
AND UP THE MOUNTAIN SLOPES OPEN IN SOME PLACES AND IN OTHERS THATCHED WITH DWARF FIRS RESTING A MINUTE HERE AND THERE TO REFRESH OURSELVES WITH HUCKLEBERRIES WHICH GREW IN ABUNDANCE IN OPEN SPOTS ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE SUNSET
AS IT PROVED NEXT DAY THE NEAREST WAS THREE MILES AWAY AFTER WRAPPING MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS I STILL GAZED INTO THE MARVELOUS SKY AND MADE OUT TO SLEEP ONLY ABOUT TWO HOURS THEN WITHOUT WAKING THE NOISY SLEEPERS I AROSE
AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO RISK YOUR LIFE ON TREACHEROUS PEAKS AND PRECIPICES
THE CAPTAIN REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR MORE STEAM WHICH THE ENGINEER REFUSED TO FURNISH CAUTIOUSLY KEEPING THE PRESSURE LOW BECAUSE THE SALT WATER FOAMED IN THE BOILERS AND SOME OF IT PASSED OVER INTO THE CYLINDERS CAUSING
CIRQUES AND BRANCH CANYONS ALONG THE TOPS AND SIDES OF THE WALLS THE INDIANS HAVE A TRADITION THAT THE RIVER USED TO RUN THROUGH A TUNNEL UNDER THE UNITED FRONTS OF THE TWO LARGE TRIBUTARY GLACIERS MENTIONED ABOVE
AND BODY CARE AND WEATHER CARE VANISHED MISTER CHOQUETTE THE KEEPER OF THE STATION FERRIED ME ACROSS THE RIVER AND I SPENT THE DAY IN GETTING GENERAL VIEWS AND PLANNING THE WORK THAT
UNTIL THE REQUIRED THICKNESS IS ATTAINED THE PEDICELS AND SPORE CASES GIVE A PURPLISH TINGE AND THE WHOLE BRIDGE IS ENRICHED WITH FERNS AND A ROW OF SMALL SEEDLING TREES AND CURRANT BUSHES WITH COLORED LEAVES
AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN TURNING FROM SIDE TO SIDE STEAMING AND DRYING AFTER BEING WET TWO DAYS AND A NIGHT FORTUNATELY THIS NIGHT IT DID NOT RAIN BUT IT WAS VERY COLD
AND MADE HIM LEAN ON MY SHOULDER WHILE I STEADIED HIM TO PREVENT HIS FALLING THIS SLOW STAGGERING STRUGGLE FROM FIRE TO FIRE LASTED UNTIL LONG AFTER SUNRISE WHEN AT LAST WE REACHED THE SHIP AND STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE NARROW SINGLE PLANK
ANY TIME I REPLIED I SHALL SEE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE OF THE GLACIER AND I KNOW NOT HOW LONG IT WILL HOLD ME WELL BUT WHEN WILL I COME TO LOOK FOR YOU IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
WHITE FOUNTAINS TO SWELL THE GRAND CENTRAL ICE RIVER IN THE ANGLE FORMED BY THE MAIN GLACIER AND THE LAKE THAT GIVES RISE TO THE RIVER FLOODS THERE IS A MASSIVE GRANITE DOME SPARSELY FEATHERED WITH TREES
RED AND YELLOW SALMON BERRIES WITH CLUSTERS OF SMALLER DROPS
MIGHT HAVE OFFERED TO HER AND HAVE HAD HER IF HE WOULD MY DEAR COUSIN AS I WOULD RATHER THAT YOU SHOULD HEAR MY NEWS FROM MYSELF THAN FROM ANY ONE ELSE I WRITE TO TELL YOU THAT
A GREAT NOBLEMAN WHOM ALL LIBERALS LOVED AND A MEMBER OF THE CABINET HE HAD COME IN SINCE DINNER AND HAD BEEN ASKING A QUESTION OR TWO AS TO WHAT HAD BEEN DECIDED WELL YES IF PROPERLY INVESTED I THINK IT WILL
THOUGH SHE BELIEVED THAT SHE HATED HIM SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET UP SOME SHOW OF AN AFFECTIONATE FAREWELL SOME SCENE IN WHICH THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEARS AND TENDERNESS AND POETRY AND PERHAPS A PARTING CARESS BUT WITH HIS JEERING WORDS AND SNEERING FACE HE WAS AS HARD TO HER AS A ROCK
AND LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH HIS HEAD A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE LIZZIE'S ANGER AGAINST THE MAN CHIEFLY AROSE FROM A FEELING THAT HE TREATED HER WITH ALL A CORSAIR'S FREEDOM WITHOUT ANY OF A CORSAIR'S TENDERNESS
SOMEBODY IN SPEAKING ON LADY EUSTACE'S BEHALF AND MAKING THE BEST OF HER VIRTUES HAD DECLARED THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE LOVERS HITHERTO THAT HAD BEEN TRUE OF HER
IN A LARGE OLD FASHIONED HOUSE WITH A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GARDEN CALLED FAWN COURT AFTER THAT SPEECH OF HERS TO LUCY FRANK GREYSTOCK DID NOT CALL AGAIN AT FAWN COURT FOR MANY MONTHS
I THINK YOU OWE IT TO HER WELL DUKE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF PLANTAGENET'S PENNY NOW WILL IT EVER BE WORTH TWO HALFPENCE THIS QUESTION WAS ASKED OF THE DUKE OF SAINT BUNGAY
AN ASPIRANT MUST LEARN EVERYTHING BUT A MAN MAY MAKE HIS FORTUNE AT IT AND KNOW ALMOST NOTHING HE MAY EXAMINE A WITNESS WITH JUDGMENT SEE THROUGH A CASE WITH PRECISION
IS IS OH LORD GEORGE DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT SHE IS I KNOW THAT MISSUS CARBUNCLE IS IN A VERY BAD WAY AND THAT THAT GIRL HAS GONE CRAZY AND THAT POOR GRIFF HAS TAKEN HIMSELF OFF TO JAPAN AND THAT I AM SO KNOCKED ABOUT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO
IT'S ALL VERY WELL FOR YOUR NOBLE MASTER TO TALK OF BEING CIVIL AND HOPING THAT THE HORSE HAD CARRIED HIM WELL AND ALL THAT THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A MAN CAN'T BE CIVIL AND THEN EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM
THOUSAND POUNDS SHE REPLIED TEN THOUSAND POUNDS LORD FAWN RIVETED HIS EYES UPON THEM THAT'S WHAT I AM TOLD BY A JEWELLER
AGAIN PERHAPS THE ACTING WAS A LITTLE OVERDONE
AND OF COURSE LUCY MUST GO TO THE HITTAWAYS SHE WAS BUT A LITTLE THING AND IT CANNOT BE SAID OF HER AS OF LADY EUSTACE THAT SHE WAS A BEAUTY THE CHARM OF HER FACE CONSISTED IN THE PECULIAR WATERY BRIGHTNESS OF HER EYES
AT SOME CORNER OF THE CASTLE WHICH SEEMED A LONG WAY FROM THE GREAT DOOR IT WAS A CHEERFUL LITTLE ROOM WITH CHINTZ CURTAINS
SHE IS NOT AN OLD CAT LIZZIE AND I WON'T HEAR HER CALLED SO
IS AFRAID OF WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY OF HIM AND TO GIVE HIM HIS DUE IS AFRAID ALSO OF DOING WHAT IS WRONG HE IS TIMID WEAK CONSCIENTIOUS AND WRETCHED IF YOU HAVE SET YOUR HEART UPON MARRYING HIM MY HEART SAID LIZZIE SCORNFULLY OR YOUR MIND
AND THEN LET THE MATTER BE SETTLED BY ARBITRATION
OR AT LEAST ON BEHALF OF THIS SPECIAL CHILD AND SHE DID THINK IT WOULD BE VERY NICE IF FRANK WOULD MARRY AN HEIRESS THIS HOWEVER WAS A LONG TIME AGO NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO
I WAS SO GLAD YOU GOT THAT POOR MAN'S HORSE YOU WERE NOT ANGRY THEN THEY HAD NOW PASSED ACROSS THE HALL AND WERE ON THE BOTTOM STAIR CERTAINLY NOT AND YOU ARE NOT ANGRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE
I AM GOING TO PORTRAY ON MONDAY AND NEVER COMING BACK ANY MORE YOU'LL BE UP HERE BEFORE THE SEASON IS OVER WITH FIFTY MORE WONDERFUL SCHEMES IN YOUR LITTLE HEAD SO LORD FAWN IS DONE WITH IS HE
I FORGIVE YOU ALL AND HOPE YOU MAY DO WELL YET IF I MAY GIVE YOU ONE BIT OF ADVICE AT PARTING IT IS TO CAUTION YOU AGAINST BEING CLEVER WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO GET BY IT I AIN'T CLEVER AT ALL SAID LIZZIE BEGINNING TO WHIMPER
MISTER GOWRAN THOUGHT THAT HE KNEW A GENTLEMAN WHEN HE SAW ONE HE THOUGHT ALSO THAT HE KNEW A LADY AND THAT HE DIDN'T SEE ONE WHEN HE WAS ENGAGED WITH HIS MISTRESS COUSIN INDEED
THE NAME OF ADMIRAL GREYSTOCK AS HAVING BEEN THE FATHER OF HIS MISTRESS HAD INDEED REACHED HIS EARS BUT ANDY GOWRAN WAS A SUSPICIOUS MAN
NOR CAN I SAID LIZZIE
THERE HAD BEEN BUT A MOMENT AND IN THAT MOMENT THIS WAS ALL THAT LUCINDA WOULD SAY NOW I DON'T MEAN TO STIR AGAIN SAID LIZZIE THROWING HERSELF INTO A CORNER OF A SOFA
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TO BE SO HAPPY HERE
BEFORE FRANK HAD JOINED THEM SO WOULD YOU BE OUT OF SORTS IF YOU'D LOST YOUR RUN AND HAD TO PICK A YOUNG WOMAN OUT OF THE WATER I DON'T LIKE YOUNG WOMEN WHEN THEY'RE DAMP AND SMELL OF MUD YOU MEAN TO MARRY HER I SUPPOSE
BUT HE SAYS THEY BELONG TO THE FAMILY HE'LL SAY ANYTHING SAID LIZZIE MY DEAREST GIRL THERE CAN'T BE A MORE RESPECTABLE MAN THAN MISTER CAMPERDOWN YOU MUST DO SOMETHING OF THE KIND YOU KNOW
THE WIDE EXPANSE OF GLITTERING WAVES
FREDERIC SAT HIMSELF BESIDE HER AND THE INTERCOURSE FOR AWHILE WAS SUCH AS MIGHT BE LOOKED FOR BETWEEN TWO LOVERS OF WHOM ONE WAS A WIDOW
DON'T KNOW HOW THAT MAY BE SAID LIZZIE TRYING TO BRING HER MIND TO WORK UPON THE SUBJECT STEADILY MISTER CAMPERDOWN HAS BEEN VERY UNCOURTEOUS TO ME I MUST SAY THAT AND AS I THINK UNFAIR
MISTER CAMPERDOWN THOUGHT THAT THE PROPERTY SHOULD BE GIVEN UP OH YES THAT'S THE MAN'S NAME A HORRID MAN I AM TOLD THAT HE WAS REALLY MOST CRUEL TO HER
BUT HE DID INQUIRE WHO WAS LIZZIE'S SOLICITOR OF COURSE THERE WILL BE THINGS TO BE SETTLED HE SAID AND MY LAWYER HAD BETTER SEE YOURS MISTER CAMPERDOWN IS A MISTER CAMPERDOWN
AND THOSE SPECIAL MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT WHO WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR GIVING SPECIAL HELP TO THE FINANCIAL HERCULES OF THE DAY A QUESTION PERHAPS OF NO GREAT PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE HAD OCCURRED TO MISTER PALLISER
THOUGH IT WERE BUT FOR A MOMENT LORD FAWN WAS POMPOUS SLOW DULL AND CAREFUL BUT EVEN HE HAD GIVEN WAY TO IT AT ONCE
OF COURSE I WOULD NOT GIVE THEM UP BECAUSE THEY WERE MY OWN
AND ON MONDAY YOU KILLED FOUR WHY SHOULD YOU BE TIRED I SUPPOSE IT WAS NEARLY TWENTY MILES SAID FRANK WHO WAS ALSO IGNORANT ABOUT TEN PERHAPS SAID LORD GEORGE
I THINK I COULD ALMOST DO IT MYSELF
AS SHE COULD NOT RUSH INTO HIS ARMS
AND HERRIOT HAD COME GREYSTOCK BROUGHT WITH HIM TWO GUNS TWO FISHING RODS A MAN SERVANT
AND THEN TO SEE LUCINDA FALL INTO IT AND SHE COULD REMEMBER EVERY JUMP AND HER FEELING OF ECSTASY AS SHE LANDED ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND SHE HAD BY HEART EVERY KIND WORD THAT LORD GEORGE HAD SAID TO HER
WHO HAD A WELL FORMED IDEA OF HER OWN IDENTITY SHE WAS QUITE RESOLVED TO BE SOMEBODY AMONG HER FELLOW CREATURES NOT SOMEBODY IN THE WAY OF MARRYING A LORD OR A RICH MAN OR SOMEBODY IN THE WAY OF BEING A BEAUTY OR SOMEBODY AS A WIT BUT
YOU SEE WE HAVE ALL OF US BEEN MADE REMARKABLE HAVEN'T WE YOU ARE ALWAYS REMARKABLE LORD GEORGE
MUST GIVE UP SAYING THAT HE DOESN'T DO HIS WORK PROPERLY
HE WAS ESPECIALLY TIMID AND LIVED IN A PERPETUAL FEAR LEST THE NEWSPAPERS SHOULD SAY SOMETHING HARD OF HIM
SO THERE IS NO FEAR THAT HE WILL HAVE TO LIVE UPON MY JOINTURE WHICH OF COURSE WOULD NOT BE RIGHT PRAY TELL THE DEAR BISHOP AND DEAR MARGARETTA ALL THIS WITH MY LOVE
WHEN LIZZIE RETURNED WITH THE MOROCCO CASE IN HER HAND IT WAS THE MANNER IN WHICH HE GAVE IT TO ME SAID LIZZIE AS SHE OPENED THE CLASP WHICH MAKES ITS VALUE TO ME LORD FAWN
SAID MISTER PALLISER BUT I DO SAID LADY GLENCORA AND SO THE MATTER WAS ARRANGED IT WAS A VERY NICE LITTLE DINNER MISSUS GRESHAM AND MISSUS BONTEEN WERE THERE
THIS OF COURSE WAS UNPLEASANT BUT MISSUS CARBUNCLE DID NOT HAVE THE HONOURS OF THE BATTLE ALL TO HERSELF LIZZIE ALSO SAID SOME UNPLEASANT THINGS WHICH PERHAPS WERE THE MORE UNPLEASANT BECAUSE THEY WERE TRUE
WELL I GUESS YOU NO NEED TO ASK ME A QUESTION LIKE THAT MISS KILBURN I HAIN'T OBLIGED TO MAKE UP TO MISTER PECK THOUGH FOR WHAT I DONE IN THE BEGINNIN BY CONDEMNIN EVERYBUDDY ELSE WITHOUT MERCY NOW MISSUS BOLTON'S EYES DID NOT FLASH FIRE
I GUESS YOU WON'T GET MARIA AWAY FROM HER VERY EASY SAID MISTER SAVOR LAUGHING HIS WIFE STOOD WITH THE CHILD'S CHEEK PRESSED TIGHT AGAINST HERS OH I'LL MANAGE THAT SAID MISSUS MUNGER I'M COUNTING ON MISSUS SAVOR SHE ADDED IN A HURRIED UNDERTONE TO ANNIE
COWED AND TROUBLED BY THE AFFAIR THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE SAID MISSUS MUNGER IMPARTIALLY ALL YOU WILL HAVE TO DO IS TO KEEP STILL I WILL PUT THE CASE TO HER SHE CHECKED THE PONY BEFORE THE BAR WHICH THE FLAGMAN AT THE RAILROAD CROSSING HAD LET DOWN
IT WAS AN OUTRAGE FOR MISTER PUTNEY TO GET INTOXICATED IN MY HOUSE AND FOR MISTER PECK TO ATTACK ME AS HE DID BEFORE EVERYBODY BECAUSE MISTER PUTNEY HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF HIS PRIVILEGES WAS ABOMINABLE
AND THEN I THOUGHT SHE HAD MERELY GONE OFF WITH SOME OF THE OTHER CHILDREN WHO WERE PLAYING ABOUT YOU SHALL TALK ALL THAT OVER LATER SAID MISSUS MUNGER NOW MISS KILBURN
AND FINDING ITS FIRST APARTMENT EMPTY
WE'LL GO DOWN TO THE WORKS YOU'VE NEVER MET MY HUSBAND YET HAVE YOU ANNIE NO I HAVEN'T LYRA I'VE ALWAYS JUST MISSED HIM SOMEHOW HE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PERPETUALLY JUST GONE TO TOWN OR NOT GOT BACK WELL
THE DOCTOR LAUGHED I CAN'T PRESCRIBE IN MATTERS OF SOCIAL DUTY
WAS HE INTOXICATED DID YOU THINK SO
I WOULD RATHER NOT SEE MISSUS WILMINGTON WITH YOU ON THIS SUBJECT I SHOULD BE OF NO USE
SHE MET THE YOUNGER SISTER WHOM SHE FOUND A GREAT BEAUTY SHE SEEMED VERY COLD AND OF A HAUTEUR WHICH SHE SUBDUED WITH DIFFICULTY BUT SHE WAS MORE CONSECUTIVELY POLITE THAN HER SISTER AND ANNIE WATCHED WITH FASCINATION HER TURNS OF THE HEAD
OUGHT TO BE TACIT OR EXPLICIT IN THE KISSING AND EMBRACING BETWEEN ROMEO AND JULIET
MISSUS WILMINGTON WAS DRESSED IN A LIGHT MORNING DRESS WITH A WATTEAU FALL WHOSE DELICATE RUSSETS AND FADED REDS AND YELLOWS HEIGHTENED THE RICHNESS OF HER COMPLEXION AND HAIR WHY ANNIE SHE SAID HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU
EXCEPT WHEN JACK WILMINGTON CURTLY ORDERED THEM TO DO THIS OR THAT IN ILLUSTRATION OF SOME POINT HE WAS EXPLAINING SHE WEARIED HERSELF AS PEOPLE DO IN SUCH PLACES IN EXPRESSING HER WONDER AT THE INGENUITY OF THE MACHINERY
SOME OF THE MINISTERS MINGLED WITH THEM AND TRIED TO FORM A BOND BETWEEN THEM AND THE OTHER VILLAGERS MISTER PECK TOOK NO PART IN THIS WORK HE STOOD HOLDING HIS ELBOWS WITH HIS HANDS AND TALKING WITH A PERFUNCTORY AIR TO AN OLD LADY OF HIS CONGREGATION
AND EVERYBODY ELSE WILL FEEL A LITTLE MORE AT HOME WITHOUT THEM POOR MISTER BRANDRETH I'M SURE YOU WILL I DID PITY YOU SO WITH SUCH A JULIET ON YOUR HANDS IN DOORS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LOWER CLASSES WERE LESS AT EASE THAN THEY WERE WITHOUT
THE PEOPLE BEYOND THE ROPE HAD NEARLY ALL GONE AWAY AND MISTER SAVOR WAS COMING BACK ACROSS THE COURT WITH MISTER PECK THE PLAYERS APPEARED FROM THE GROVE AT THE OTHER END OF THE COURT IN THEIR VIVID COSTUMES CHATTING AND LAUGHING WITH THEIR FRIENDS
WE COULDN'T SAID MISSUS BOLTON FROM THE PANTRY
THE VERY FACT THAT HE DID SO CARRIES CONVICTION TO SOME MINDS AND THOSE ARE THE MINDS WE HAVE GOT TO DEAL WITH WHEN HE GETS UP IN THE NEXT SOCIETY MEETING THERE'S A MIGHTY GREAT DANGER THAT HE'LL HAVE A STRONG PARTY TO BACK HIM
IDELLA RUBBED HER FACE HARD ON THE PILLOW YOU DRESS UP CATS SHE LIFTED HER FACE AND LOOKED WITH EYES OF LAUGHING MALICE INTO ANNIE'S AND ANNIE PUSHED HER FACE AGAINST IDELLA'S NECK AND CRIED YOU'RE A ROGUE
WE'RE ALL VERY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HOME AGAIN MISS KILBURN I'VE OFTEN HEARD MY WIFE SPEAK OF YOUR OLD DAYS TOGETHER AT HATBORO THEY FENCED WITH SOME POLITE FEINTS OF INTEREST IN EACH OTHER THE OLD MAN STANDING BESIDE HIS WRITING TABLE
I HAVEN'T EXPRESSED ANY OPINION OF YOUR CHARACTER MISSUS MUNGER IF YOU'LL REMEMBER PLEASE AND AS FOR THE SOCIAL UNION I SHALL HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO DO WITH IT MYSELF ANNIE DREW HERSELF UP A LITTLE HIGHER AND SILENTLY WAITED FOR HER VISITOR TO GO
SHE HAD NOT THE PATIENCE TO WAIT FOR HER TO BRING IN THE DINNER BEFORE SPEAKING ABOUT THE EXCITING EVENT AT CHURCH BUT MISSUS BOLTON WOULD NOT BE LED UP TO THE SUBJECT BY A TACIT INVITATION
THE TIRELESS MACHINES MARCHED BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE MEN WHO WATCHED THEM WITH SUICIDAL INTENSITY RAN AFTER THEM BAREFOOTED WHEN THEY MADE OFF WITH A BROKEN THREAD SPLICED IT AND THEN ESCAPED FROM THEM TO THEIR STATIONS AGAIN
I'M GLAD TO FIND YOU I'VE JUST RUN HOME WITH MOTHER SHE FEELS THE NIGHT AIR AND I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD SLIP THROUGH OUR FINGERS BEFORE I GOT BACK THIS LITTLE BUSINESS OF THE REFRESHMENTS WAS AN AFTERTHOUGHT OF MISSUS MUNGER'S AND WE MEANT IT FOR A SURPRISE
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT ANNIE BROKE OUT BUT SHE WAS GREATLY TROUBLED WHAT DO YOU THINK ELLEN
WELL ANNIE SAID PUTNEY HE SHOOK HANDS WITH HER AND MISSUS PUTNEY WHO WAS THERE WITH DOCTOR MORRELL ASKED HER WHERE SHE HAD SAT WE KEPT LOOKING ALL ROUND FOR YOU YES SAID PUTNEY WITH HIS HAND ON HIS BOY'S SHOULDER WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW YOU LIKED THE MERCUTIO
VERY SAID THE DOCTOR HADN'T WE BETTER FOLLOW MISSUS WILMINGTON'S EXAMPLE AND GET UP UNDER THE PIAZZA ROOF I'M AFRAID YOU'LL BE THE WORSE FOR THE NIGHT AIR MISS KILBURN
MISSUS MUNGER HAD NOT PRESSED ANNIE FOR AN OPINION ON THIS POINT AT ALL BUT IN THEIR INTEREST IN IT THEY BOTH IGNORED THE FACT MISSUS MUNGER TACITLY ADMITTED HER POSITION IN RETORTING HE NEEDN'T HAVE STAYED
AND YOU TOO MISSUS MUNGER HOW VURRY NICE HER WORDS TOOK VALUE FROM THE THICK MELLOW TONES OF HER VOICE AND PASSED FOR MUCH MORE THAN THEY WERE WORTH INTRINSICALLY
BETWEEN THE HIGH WINDOWY BULKS OF THE SHOE SHOPS AND HAT SHOPS THE DUST GRADUALLY FREED ITSELF FROM THE CINDERS ABOUT THE TRACKS AND IT HARDENED INTO A HANDSOME NEWLY MADE ROAD BEYOND THE HOUSES OF THE SHOP HANDS
OH MISS NORTHWICK HOW CAN I THANK YOU ENOUGH THE WHOLE PLAY TURNED UPON YOU IT'S JUST AS WELL SHE SAID TO ANNIE AS THE NORTHWICKS AND THEIR FRIENDS WALKED ACROSS THE LAWN TO THE GATE WHERE THEY HAD CARRIAGES WAITING THEY'D HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO MANAGE
THE LITTLE ONE SCREAMED WITH LAUGHTER AND GURGLED OH YOU TICKLE YOU TICKLE THEY HAD A CHILDISH ROMP PROLONGED THROUGH THE DETAILS OF IDELLA'S WASHING AND DRESSING AND ANNIE TRIED TO LOSE IN HER FROLIC WITH THE CHILD THE ANXIETIES THAT HAD BESET HER WAKING
YOU WON'T SLEEP YOURSELF TO NIGHT I'M AFRAID SAID HIS WIFE OH MISSUS MUNGER HAS PROMISED ME A PARTICULARLY WEAK CUP OF COFFEE SHE HAS GOT US ALL IN IT SEEMS FOR A SORT OF SUPPER IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING
ANNIE WENT ON IT WAS SHAMEFUL
LYRA TURNED TO WALK TOWARD THE HOUSE DEFLECTING A LITTLE IN THE DIRECTION OF HER NEPHEW AND MISS NORTHWICK
AND THERE'S NO USE TRYING TO DENY IT AS MISTER PUTNEY SAYS HE AND I HAVE OUR RECORD AND WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE ANY PRETENCES AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER I OUGHT TO GO BACK ON MY FELLOW HANDS OH
AND SHE WATCHED HIM ANXIOUSLY WHEN THE CLARET CUP CAME HE WAVED HIS HAND OVER IT AND SAID NO I'LL TAKE SOME OF THE LEMONADE AS HE LIFTED A GLASS OF IT TOWARD HIS LIPS HE STOPPED AND MADE AS IF TO PUT IT DOWN AGAIN AND HIS HAND SHOOK SO THAT HE SPILLED SOME OF IT
YOU'D BETTER ASK HIM GROWLED THE YOUNG FELLOW WELL SAID MISSUS WILMINGTON WITH ANOTHER LAUGH I'LL THINK IT OVER MISSUS MUNGER THANK YOU SAID MISSUS MUNGER AND NOW WE MUST REALLY BE GOING
WHICH HER PHYSICAL DELICACY AWAKENED SHE ASKED HER HOW SHE EVER CAME TO TAKE UP THE SOCIAL UNION AND ANSWERED FOR HER THAT OF COURSE IT HAD THE ATTRACTION OF THE THEATRICALS AND WENT ON TO TALK OF HER SISTER'S PART IN THEM
THE STATUTE PROVISIONS AND RULES OF THE SOCIETY WA'N'T ORDERED BY PROVIDENCE
OH POOR ANNIE LYRA BEGAN TO LAUGH WITH AGREEABLE INTELLIGENCE DO COME IN AND TELL ME ABOUT IT WHY IS THAT GIRL GOING TO TAKE PART IN THE THEATRICALS SHE DOESN'T CARE TO PLEASE ANY ONE DOES SHE
I'VE BEEN ASKING MISS KILBURN TO GO WITH ME TO MISSUS PUTNEY'S I THINK IT WOULD BE A GRACEFUL AND PROPER THING FOR ME TO DO TO EXPRESS MY SYMPATHY AND INTEREST AND TO HEAR WHAT MISSUS PUTNEY REALLY HAS TO SAY
I SOON HAD ONE OF THE CANDLES LIGHTED I SAT DOWN ON THE AFTER THWART AND HELD THE LIGHT ALOFT TILL MY ARM ACHED EVERYTHING ABOUT ME WAS MADE MORE WEIRD BY THE GLEAM OF THE LANTERN
YOU BEGIN TO BE RATHER PUSHING THE OLD TREE SAID YOU SHOULD TRY TO GROW A LITTLE BROADER AND STOP THIS SHOOTING UP INTO THE AIR JUST SEE WHERE YOUR BRANCHES ARE SOARING
AND WHEN SHE WAS A BUTTERFLY AND WAS GOING TO DIE AGAIN SHE SAID
WITH THE GUILE SO APT TO DEVELOP IN A BOY WHO HAS OLDER BROTHERS WHO TEASE HIM BUT WE DID SAID JOHN IF YOU TELL THEM I'LL LICK YOU EXCLAIMED WILLIS MAKE THEM BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN GUARDING THIS BEAR JOHN AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF SO GLARING A DECEPTION
WELL THE ICE SLID ALONG MELTING ALL THE WHILE AND MAKING GREAT TORRENTS OF WATER WHICH AS THEY SWEPT ONWARD COVERED LAND WITH CLAY AND PEBBLES
JOHN HAD A SMALL AXE WITH WHICH TO SPLIT THE TIMBERS FOUR OLD NEWSPAPERS IN WHICH TO GATHER UP THE PRECIOUS DUST AND A BOTTLE IN WHICH TO PUT IT IT WAS THANKSGIVING MORNING THE SUN ROSE IN A CLEAR STRAW COLORED SKY
THE WHALE SEEMED TO HAVE GOT FREE FOR THE BOAT WAS IDLY ROCKING ON THE WATER IN CHANGING MY CRAMPED FORM TO AN UPRIGHT POSITION MY HAND CAME AGAINST A HARD ROUND PIECE OF IRON A FEELING OF SECURITY OF ADVANTAGE OF LONGING FOR BATTLE RAN THROUGH ME AS MY HAND RESTED ON THE COLD STEEL
CRUSHING FORESTS AS YOU WOULD CRUSH AN EGG SHELL AND WIPING OUT RIVERS AS YOU WOULD WIPE OUT A CHALK MARK SO IT CAME PUSHING THUNDERING GRINDING ALONG SLOWLY ENOUGH
WE SOON CAME TO ONE MUCH DEEPER AND BETTER STOCKED WITH TROUT AND WILLIS FIRED UNDER THE ICE AGAIN EIGHT FISH WERE SECURED HERE
WERE IN THE REAR EACH BEING A RECTANGULAR BUILDING OF HEAVY LOGS WITH LOW LOFTS ABOVE THE HOMESTEAD WAS IN FACT A CLUSTER OF HOUSES RATHER THAN A SINGLE DWELLING
AND MYSELF WERE IN THE TURKEY BUSINESS EQUAL PARTNERS WE OWNED A FLOCK OF THIRTY ONE TURKEYS THESE ROOSTED BY NIGHT IN A LARGE BUTTERNUT TREE IN FRONT OF TOM'S HOUSE IN THE VERY TOP OF IT
IN IT ARE FLINT TINDER A LANTERN CANDLES AND PACKED ALL AROUND THEM ARE SHIP'S BISCUITS INSTANTLY THE MEMORY OF OUR OFFICERS INSTRUCTIONS IN REFERENCE TO THEIR USE CAME TO ME QUICKLY TAKING THE KEG TO THE STERN OF THE BOAT I STRUCK ITS END AGAINST THE LOGGERHEAD
AND GRINNED INTO THE BARGAIN AT THE OLD OAK WHILE HE LAY AND RESTED IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES THE FIELD MOUSE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY OVER HIS NEW FOOD AND THOUGHT THAT BEECH NUTS TASTED MUCH NICER THAN ACORNS
A LITTLE TIME AFTER THE GRUB WAS FULL GROWN AND STEPPED OUT OF HER CELL AS BIG AND AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE BEES COULD WISH AND BESIDES SHE KNEW HOW TO COMMANDO AWAY WITH YOU SHE SAID
AND IMMEDIATELY THEY ALL BEGAN CALLING OUT AT ONCE AND SOON AFTER BEGAN TO FIGHT WITH ONE ANOTHER AS HARD AS EVER THEY COULD
BUT THE TIME OF THE OLD FISHES CAME AND WENT AND MANY MORE TIMES CAME AND WENT BUT STILL FAVOSITES LAY IN THE GROUND THEN CAME THE LONG HOT WET SUMMER
IT TOOK ME A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I WAS AND WHY I WAS THERE A SOUND OF SCUFFLING AND TUMBLING ON THE GROUND AT SOME DISTANCE ASSISTED MY WANDERING WITS AND I RUSHED OUT OF THE BARN AND RAN TOWARD THE FIELD
WHAT MODERN MEDICAL SCIENCE WOULD PREDICATE CONCERNING THIS PANACEA I KNOW NOT BUT THOUSANDS OF CUTS IN RURAL DISTRICTS TREATED WITH POWDER POST DID VERY WELL AND FAITH IN IT WAXED STRONG SO WHEN SAM EASTMAN CUT HIS FOOT OVER IN THE EAST WOODS
FROM THE SPLASH OF THE LITTLE ONE'S FLUKES
REPRESENTING THE TOIL OF SOME OLD FRENCH ARTISAN OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THEY PROBABLY HAD BEEN BROUGHT ACROSS THE ATLANTIC BY THE ORIGINAL EMIGRANT AND CAREFULLY PRESERVED EVER SINCE
OUI BUT WHERE AH'M FREEZING I I DON'T REMEMBER JACQUES SAYING MANY THINGS IN A PATOIS HE HAD NEVER LEARNED IN THE PROVINCIAL SCHOOL WENT BACK TO THE MILK ROOM THE LYNX VENTURED TO SHOW HIS HEAD
EACH A WAD OF FINE DRY GRASS AS LARGE AS A QUART BOX THESE WERE GATHERED UP AND FILLED THE GREAT BASKET THERE SAID HE TRIUMPHANTLY DON'T THEM SMELL MOUSEY THEY DID CERTAINLY
SUCH AS I HAD NEVER SEEN IN NEIGHBOR WILBUR'S PASTURE SOON WE CAME TO ANOTHER LARGE BROOK
IT SEEMED SAFER DOWN THERE AND WE FELT THE WIND LESS BUT LAY LISTENING TO THE GUSTS
AND AT LAST HE GATHERED SUPREME COURAGE AND LEAPED UPON THE MEAT IT FELL WITH A CRASH AGAINST THE STOVE AND THE TWO WERE AWAKENED SIMULTANEOUSLY AS JACQUES SPRANG FROM THE BED
ORDERED THE BOATS LOWERED AS THE MEN TUMBLED OVER ONE ANOTHER TO BE FIRST TO REACH THE MONSTERS MY YOUNG HEART DANCED WITHIN ME AND OUR OLD BLACK STEWARD HAD TO HOLD ME BACK I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO GO THERE WAS A GENTLE WIND BLOWING
ONE DAY THE BEAR CAME TRUDGING ALONG AND LAY DOWN AT FULL BREADTH UNDER A GREAT OAK TREE ARE YOU THERE AGAIN YOU ROBBER SAID THE OAK AND SHOOK A LOT OF WITHERED LEAVES DOWN OVER HIM YOU SHOULD NOT SQUANDER YOUR LEAVES MY OLD FRIEND
AND YOU WAS PROWLING AROUND THE FIELDS GO OFF NOW OUT THERE BY THAT STUMP FULL OF WONDER AND CURIOSITY I RETIRED TO THE STUMP TOM MEANTIME TURNED OUT THE MASS OF NESTS
YOU MAY LAY TO IT THAT I FLEW DOWN THOSE CABIN STAIRS FOR IF THERE WAS ANYTHING IN THE WORLD I LONGED FOR IT WAS TO GET A CHANCE TO SEE A SPERM WHALE KILLED AS CAPTAIN COFFIN STEPPED TO THE BOW OF THE BOAT HE ORDERED THE BLACK STEWARD TO HIS PLACE AT THE STEERING OAR
AT ANY RATE I WILL COME AND HELP YOU CONSIDER NOW IT MUST BE ONE OF THE YOUNGEST GRUBS FOR SHE MUST HAVE TIME TO THINK OVER HER NEW POSITION WHEN ONE HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP TO BE A MERE DRUDGE IT IS NOT EASY TO ACCUSTOM ONESELF TO WEAR A CROWN
HE WAS SEEN AFTER HE HAD RUN A FEW YARDS TO MAKE A GREAT JUMP AND THEN REMAIN IN HIS TRACKS THE PURSUING PARTY FOUND HIM ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DEMOLISHING A MOCCASIN WHICH HE HAD CRUSHED BY JUMPING AND LANDING WITH HIS FEET UPON ITS HEAD AND BACK
I WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME SANG THE LARK DESCENDING ONCE MORE I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD REITERATED THE CATERPILLAR WITH AS GRAVE A FACE AS IF IT WERE A FACT
SHE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THEM ALL AND ONLY JUST COME OUT OF THE EGG SHE COULD NOT SEE BUT SHE COULD PLAINLY HEAR THE GROWN UP BEES TALKING OUTSIDE AND FOR A WHILE SHE LAY QUITE STILL AND KEPT HER THOUGHTS TO HERSELF ALL AT ONCE SHE SAID OUT LOUD
AND THEY PERSPIRED AS WELL AS THEY HAD LEARNED TO AND THE PRETTIEST YELLOW WAX CAME OUT OF THEIR BODIES GOOD SAID THE QUEEN NOW WE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD THE OLD BEES TOOK THE WAX AND BEGAN TO BUILD A NUMBER OF LITTLE SIX SIDED CELLS ALL ALIKE AND CLOSE UP TO ONE ANOTHER
THEY HUMMED AND BUZZED THEY STRETCHED THEIR LEGS THEY TRIED THEIR WINGS THEY SWARMED OUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS THEY CRAWLED UP AND DOWN THE HIVE THEY FLEW OFF TO THE FLOWERS AND BUSHES OR WANDERED ALL AROUND ON THE GROUND THERE WERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF THEM
BUT JACQUES CARRIED A HIND QUARTER IN AND SUSPENDED IT BESIDE THE CLOSED FIREPLACE LATER CUTTING OFF STEAKS FOR SUPPER AND BREAKFAST THEY PASSED A MERRY EVENING EACH TELLING STORIES OF HIS EXPERIENCES
THERE WAS NO NEED FOR HASTE ON SAM'S ACCOUNT FOR JOHN TOLD US THAT THE CUT FOOT WAS NO LONGER VERY PAINFUL AND SAM HAD SLEPT WELL THE DISTANCE WAS ABOUT FOUR MILES
HOGS OF THIS PARTICULAR KIND ARE FAMOUS SNAKE KILLERS A BIG RATTLER OR A GARTER SNAKE IS ALL THE SAME TO THEM THEY ADVANCE TO THE ATTACK WITH THE GREATEST IMPETUOSITY AND A FEAST UPON SNAKE IS THE USUAL REWARD OF EXCEPTIONAL BRAVERY
AND NO LONGER RUSTLED UNDERFOOT RED AND GRAY SQUIRRELS SCAMPERED ACROSS OUR PATH BUT WILLIS DISDAINED TO FIRE AT THEM HE WAS LOADED FOR DEER BESIDES HE HAD BUT THREE EXTRA CHARGES POWDER AND SHOT WERE USUALLY SCARCE WITH US
TOM LAY DOWN AND I COVERED HIM UP COMPLETELY WITH THE CONTENTS OF THE BIG BASKET HE THEN PRACTICED SQUEAKING AND RUSTLING SEVERAL TIMES TO BE SURE THAT ALL WAS IN GOOD TRIM HIS SQUEAKS WERE PERFECT SUCCESSES
YOU JEST WITH MY INFERIORITY NOW YOU ARE CRUEL AS WELL AS FOOLISH
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DARED BUILD A FIRE IN THE BARN EVEN IF WE HAD HAD MATCHES WILLIS GROPED ABOUT IN THE OLD HAY BAY AND GATHERED A FEW HANDFULS OF MUSTY HAY
AND WHEN SHE WAS GOING INTO HER CHRYSALIS GRAVE SHE SAID I SHALL BE A BUTTERFLY SOME DAY BUT HER RELATIONS THOUGHT HER HEAD WAS WANDERING AND THEY SAID POOR THING
WITH THE DUSK WE STOLE OUT INTO THE FIELD WHERE THE STONE HEAPS WERE AND WHERE WE HAD OFTENEST HEARD FOXES BARK SELECTING A NOOK IN THE EDGE OF A CLUMP OF RASPBERRY BRIARS WHICH GREW ABOUT A GREAT PINE STUMP
AND ALL TEN OF THEM STEPPED OUT BEAUTIFUL FULL GROWN QUEEN BEES THE OTHER BEES RAN UP AND GAZED AT THEM IN ADMIRATION
AS THE BOATS SEPARATED I TURNED AND WATCHED THE DYING WHALE IT WAS SLOWLY SWIMMING AROUND IN A LARGE CIRCLE AND THE BLOOD WAS JUST OOZING FROM ITS SPOUT HOLES AS IT CAME TO THE SURFACE TO BREATHE THE SUN WAS ABOUT A HANDSPIKE HIGH FROM THE HORIZON
MUST BE PRODUCTIVE OF THE HIGHEST ADVANTAGES MONEY TO BE SURE OF ITSELF IS OF NO USE FOR ITS ONLY USE IS TO PART WITH IT ROUSSEAU AND ALL THOSE WHO DEAL IN PARADOXES
AS TO THE IRKSOMENESS OF BOOKS TO MEN OF AN ADVANCED AGE WHICH IS TOO OFTEN FULFILLED WAS SO FAR FROM BEING VERIFIED IN JOHNSON
BUT BEING ORIGINALLY POOR HE HAS GOT A LOVE OF MEAN COMPANY AND LOW JOCULARITY A VERY BAD THING SIR TO LAUGH IS GOOD AS TO TALK IS GOOD
TO PUBLISH AN ADVERTISEMENT IN THE NEWSPAPERS CONTRADICTING THE REPORT
SO THEY HAVE BETAKEN THEMSELVES TO ERROUR TRUTH SIR IS A COW WHICH WILL YIELD SUCH PEOPLE NO MORE MILK
VIRGIL HORACE PHAEDRUS THE GREATEST AND MOST NECESSARY TASK STILL REMAINS TO ATTAIN A HABIT OF EXPRESSION WITHOUT WHICH KNOWLEDGE IS OF LITTLE USE
IT HAS NOW BEEN FASHIONABLE FOR NEAR HALF A CENTURY TO DEFAME AND VILIFY THE HOUSE OF STUART AND TO EXALT AND MAGNIFY THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH THE STUARTS HAVE FOUND FEW APOLOGISTS
WE WERE SO WEARY OF OUR OLD KING
MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO EXCITE INDUSTRY BUT CAN HARDLY GENERATE CONFIDENCE I KNOW NOT WHETHER I CAN HEARTILY REJOICE AT THE KIND RECEPTION WHICH YOU HAVE FOUND OR AT THE POPULARITY TO WHICH YOU ARE EXALTED
APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN VERY SMALL IN THE LAST REIGN COMPARED WITH WHAT A PUBLICATION OF THE SAME SIZE HAS SINCE BEEN KNOWN TO YIELD I HAVE MENTIONED UPON JOHNSON'S OWN AUTHORITY
THE SILENT CHANGES MADE BY TIME ARE NOT ALWAYS PERCEIVED AND IF THEY ARE NOT PERCEIVED CANNOT BE RECOUNTED I HAVE RISEN AND LAIN DOWN TALKED AND MUSED
YOUR NOTES UPON MY POET WERE VERY ACCEPTABLE I BEG THAT YOU WILL BE SO KIND AS TO CONTINUE YOUR SEARCHES IT WILL BE REPUTABLE TO MY WORK AND SUITABLE TO YOUR PROFESSORSHIP TO HAVE SOMETHING OF YOURS IN THE NOTES AS YOU HAVE GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT YOUR NAME
WHO HAVE LITTLE OF EITHER IN COMMON LIFE CAN EXHIBIT ON THE STAGE HIS VOICE WHEN STRAINED IS UNPLEASING AND WHEN LOW IS NOT ALWAYS HEARD
THE TRUTH HOWEVER IS THAT WE JUDGE OF THE HAPPINESS AND MISERY OF LIFE DIFFERENTLY AT DIFFERENT TIMES ACCORDING TO THE STATE OF OUR CHANGEABLE FRAME
THEY HAVE MORE WIT AND HUMOUR AND KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE THAN WE HAD BUT THEN THE DOGS ARE NOT SO GOOD SCHOLARS SIR IN MY EARLY YEARS I READ VERY HARD IT IS A SAD REFLECTION BUT A TRUE ONE
WITH A SHORT AND PERSPICUOUS RECOMMENDATION OF EACH ARTICLE AS ALSO THE VISION OF THEODORE THE HERMIT FOUND IN HIS CELL
I RECEIVED YOUR KIND LETTER FROM FALMOUTH IN WHICH YOU GAVE ME NOTICE OF YOUR DEPARTURE FOR LISBON AND ANOTHER FROM LISBON IN WHICH YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE TO LEAVE PORTUGAL IN A FEW DAYS TO EITHER OF THESE
YOU MUST THEREFORE BE ENABLED TO DISCHARGE PETTY DEBTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE LEISURE WITH SECURITY TO STRUGGLE WITH THE REST NEITHER THE GREAT NOR LITTLE DEBTS DISGRACE YOU
OF DEAR MISSUS LANGTON YOU GIVE ME NO ACCOUNT
AS MIGHT LEAD THE READER TO THINK THAT ITS AUTHOUR HAD DEVOTED ALL HIS LIFE TO IT I ASKED HIM WHETHER HE KNEW MUCH OF ROLT AND OF HIS WORK
FOR WHICH PLACE THE BRIDE AND BRIDEGROOM SET OUT ON HORSEBACK I SUPPOSE IN VERY GOOD HUMOUR
IS MUCH TO BE VALUED AND I HAVE EVER THOUGHT THAT THOSE WHO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO THIS EMPLOYMENT AND DO THEIR DUTY WITH DILIGENCE AND SUCCESS
A POETICAL EPISTLE TO SAMUEL JOHNSON A M IN WHICH HE COMPLIMENTS JOHNSON IN A JUST AND ELEGANT MANNER
MUST HELPLESS MAN IN IGNORANCE SEDATE ROLL DARKLING DOWN THE TORRENT OF HIS FATE SHALL NO DISLIKE ALARM NO WISHES RISE
AS MAY COME WITHIN YOUR POWER HIS RELATIONS WILL THANK YOU FOR ANY SUCH GRATUITOUS ATTENTION AT LEAST THEY WILL NOT BLAME YOU FOR ANY EVIL THAT MAY HAPPEN WHETHER THEY THANK YOU OR NOT FOR ANY GOOD
AND WILL NOT INCOMMODE MY DEAR LUCY BY COMING TO LICHFIELD WHILE HER PRESENT LODGING IS OF ANY USE TO HER I HOPE IN A FEW DAYS TO BE AT LEISURE AND TO MAKE VISITS WHITHER I SHALL FLY IS MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE
WILL CARESS YOU AT YOUR RETURN THEREFORE DO NOT LET ITALIAN ACADEMICIANS NOR ITALIAN LADIES DRIVE US FROM YOUR THOUGHTS YOU MAY FIND AMONG US WHAT YOU WILL LEAVE BEHIND SOFT SMILES AND EASY SONNETS
DO NOT BUY THEM FOR I WILL GATHER ALL THOSE THAT HAVE ANYTHING OF MINE IN THEM AND SEND THEM TO MISSUS BURNEY AS A SMALL TOKEN OF GRATITUDE FOR THE REGARD WHICH SHE IS PLEASED TO BESTOW UPON ME
JOHNSON SUPPOSE A SHOEMAKER SHOULD CLAIM AN EQUALITY WITH HIM AS HE DOES WITH A LORD HOW HE WOULD STARE WHY SIR DO YOU STARE SAYS THE SHOEMAKER
BUT I HAVE GONE THITHER ONLY TO ESCAPE FROM MYSELF WE HAVE HAD MANY NEW FARCES AND THE COMEDY CALLED
WERE APT TO FLY TO INTEMPERANCE FOR RELIEF
TO CHURCH UPON THE NUPTIAL MORN NINTH
AND OF COURSE MORE HAPPINESS THAN SIX POUNDS A YEAR
A YOUNG GENTLEMAN OF GOOD FORTUNE WHO DIED EARLY AS YET HIS NAME HAD NOTHING OF THAT CELEBRITY WHICH AFTERWARDS COMMANDED THE HIGHEST ATTENTION AND RESPECT OF MANKIND
THIS YEAR MISTER MURPHY HAVING THOUGHT HIMSELF ILL TREATED BY THE REVEREND DOCTOR FRANCKLIN WHO WAS ONE OF THE WRITERS OF THE CRITICAL REVIEW PUBLISHED AN INDIGNANT VINDICATION IN
AND SO ON AS FAR AS OPULENCE CAN BE CARRIED PERHAPS HE WHO HAS A LARGE FORTUNE MAY NOT BE SO HAPPY AS HE WHO HAS A SMALL ONE BUT THAT MUST PROCEED FROM OTHER CAUSES
OR LOST BY NEGLIGENCE THAN DESTROYED BY INJURY OR VIOLENCE WE TELL THE LADIES THAT GOOD WIVES MAKE GOOD HUSBANDS I BELIEVE IT IS A MORE CERTAIN POSITION
AND AS IT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE MONTH OF MAY IN THAT YEAR IT IS EVIDENT THAT MUCH TIME WAS NOT EMPLOYED IN PREPARING IT FOR THE PRESS
WHICH HE COULD WHEN HE PLEASED EMBODY AND RENDER PERMANENT WITHOUT MUCH LABOUR SOME OF THEM HOWEVER HE OBSERVED WERE TOO GROSS FOR IMITATION THE PROFITS OF A SINGLE POEM HOWEVER EXCELLENT
THIS YEAR WAS THE SECOND EXHIBITION THEY PLEASE THEMSELVES MUCH WITH THE MULTITUDE OF SPECTATORS AND IMAGINE THAT THE ENGLISH SCHOOL WILL RISE IN REPUTATION REYNOLDS IS WITHOUT A RIVAL
IF IT BE NOT THEREFORE GONE TO DODSLEY'S I BEG IT MAY BE SENT ME BY THE PENNY POST
A ZEAL FOR TRUTH A DESIRE OF ESTABLISHING RIGHT IN OPPOSITION TO FASHION
AND THE WEALTHY HAVE EMBRACED AN OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING THEIR SONS UNDER THE LEARNED TUITION OF SAMUEL JOHNSON THE TRUTH HOWEVER IS THAT HE WAS NOT SO WELL QUALIFIED FOR BEING A TEACHER OF ELEMENTS
KNOWLEDGE IS ALWAYS TO BE WISHED TO THOSE WHO CAN COMMUNICATE IT WELL WHILE YOU HAVE BEEN RIDING AND RUNNING AND SEEING THE TOMBS OF THE LEARNED AND THE CAMPS OF THE VALIANT I HAVE ONLY STAID AT HOME AND INTENDED TO DO GREAT THINGS WHICH I HAVE NOT DONE
LIKE THAT EMPLOYED IN LEVELLING GROUND CAN BE PERCEIVED ONLY BY THOSE WHO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF COMPARING THE ORIGINAL WITH THE ALTERED COPY WHAT WE CERTAINLY KNOW TO HAVE BEEN DONE BY HIM IN THIS WAY
JOHNSON IS A VERY GOOD SCHOLAR AND POET AND I HAVE GREAT HOPES WILL TURN OUT A FINE TRAGEDY WRITER IF IT SHOULD ANY WAY LIE IN YOUR WAY
WITH SWELLED CHEEKS OF A FLORID RED PRODUCED BY THICK PAINTING AND INCREASED BY THE LIBERAL USE OF CORDIALS FLARING AND FANTASTICK IN HER DRESS AND AFFECTED BOTH IN HER SPEECH
SAID HE I NEVER SAW THE MAN AND NEVER READ THE BOOK THE BOOKSELLERS WANTED A PREFACE TO A DICTIONARY OF TRADE AND COMMERCE I KNEW VERY WELL WHAT SUCH A DICTIONARY SHOULD BE AND I WROTE A PREFACE ACCORDINGLY
AND AN ACCOUNT WHICH HE GAVE IN THE GENTLEMEN'S MAGAZINE OF MISTER TYTLER'S ACUTE AND ABLE VINDICATION OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS THE GENEROSITY OF JOHNSON'S FEELINGS SHINES FORTH IN THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE
SHE MUST HAVE HAD A SUPERIORITY OF UNDERSTANDING AND TALENTS AS SHE CERTAINLY INSPIRED HIM WITH A MORE THAN ORDINARY PASSION AND SHE HAVING SIGNIFIED HER WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT OF HIS HAND
YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE A NEW KING AND A NEW PARLIAMENT
HE WENT TO A GOLDSMITH AND BOUGHT A GOLDEN SPINNING WHEEL AND SAT DOWN WITH IT UNDER THE PRINCESS WINDOW AND BEGAN TO FILE AWAY AT HIS SPINNING WHEEL
AND AWAY WENT THE DEVIL AS FAST AS HE COULD LAY LEGS TO THE GROUND
THAT IS GOOD OF YOU THANKS WITH ALL MY HEART WE ARE SO WELL TO DO THAT WE MAY DRIVE TO CHURCH JUST AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE AND IF WE CHOOSE TO KEEP A HORSE
THAT HE'S A MASTER THIEF AND SO HE FELL TO CRYING AND SOBBING AGAIN
DEIL TAKE THAT LAD'S SHARP NOSE THIS WAS ALL HIS FAULT BUT NOW YOU MUST BE OFF AS FAST AS YOU CAN
AND WITH THAT SHE TOLD HIM HOW IT HAD GONE WITH HER AND WHAT THE PRINCE HAD SAID A FEW DAYS AFTER HACON GRIZZLEBEARD CAME HOME AT EVEN AND SAID TO MORROW I MUST STAY AT HOME AND MIND THE BABE FOR THEY ARE GOING TO KILL A PIG AT THE PALACE
RUN OUT CHILD AND PUT UP THE SHEEP BUT I HAVEN'T GOT THE SHEEP ANY MORE THAN THE REST SAID GUDBRAND FOR WHEN I HAD GONE A BIT FARTHER I SWOPPED IT AWAY FOR A GOOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU WITH ALL MY HEART CRIED HIS WIFE
AH AH DON'T STONE ME TO DEATH DON'T STONE ME TO DEATH AND I'LL GIVE YOU MY WORD NEVER TO LET TOM TOTHERHOUSE COME NEAR ME AGAIN NOW THE TEN DOLLARS ARE MINE
BUT WHEN HE CAME OUT AGAIN ON THE STEPS IF THE NORTH WIND DIDN'T COME AGAIN AND CARRY OFF THE MEAL WITH A PUFF AND MORE THAN THAT HE DID SO THE THIRD TIME AT THIS THE LAD GOT VERY ANGRY AND AS HE THOUGHT IT HARD THAT THE NORTH WIND SHOULD BEHAVE SO
NO NO THAT I HAVEN'T SAID THE LAD I'LL SOON SEE THAT SAID THE MAN AND WENT AT ONCE INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE LAD HAD BEEN NAY BUT YOU HAVE BEEN IN HERE SAID HE AND NOW YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR LIFE
THE SAME THING HAPPENED OVER AGAIN ONLY THIS TIME HER FOSTER MOTHER SAID NOW YOU SHALL BE AS GRIEVED AS I WAS WHEN YOU LET THE MOON OUT
WE ARE OUR OWN MASTERS I SHOULD THINK AND CAN LIE A BED IN THE MORNING AS LONG AS WE LIKE
WHEN THE DAYS ARE SHORT
THE NORTH WIND IS A JOLLY FELLOW FOR NOW HE HAS GIVEN ME A RAM WHICH CAN COIN GOLDEN DUCATS IF I ONLY SAY RAM RAM MAKE MONEY ALL VERY TRUE I DARESAY SAID HIS MOTHER
THE PRINCE SAID YOU WERE TO COME AND TRY YOUR HAND AT BAKING I BAKE SAID THE PRINCESS I CAN'T BAKE FOR I NEVER DID SUCH A THING IN MY LIFE WELL YOU MUST GO SAID HACON SINCE THE PRINCE HAS SAID IT
THEY LAY DOWN TO DRINK IT DRY AND SO THEY SWILLED AND SWILLED TILL THEY BURST NOW WE'RE RID OF THEM SAID THE HORSE SO
AND ASKED HIS WIFE WHO THAT WAS THAT HAD JUST STARTED WITH THE BLACK HORSE OH DO YOU MEAN HIM SAID THE GOODY WHY THAT WAS A MAN FROM PARADISE WHO SAID THAT PETER MY DEAR SECOND HUSBAND WHO IS DEAD AND GONE IS IN A SAD PLIGHT
SOME TIME AFTER HACON CAME AGAIN WITH THE STAND TO THE SPINNING WHEEL AND SAT DOWN UNDER THE PRINCESS WINDOW AND BEGAN TO FILE AT IT FOR IT WAS NOT QUITE FIT FOR USE WHEN SHE HEARD HIM FILING SHE THREW UP THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO TALK TO HIM
AND BEGAN TO LAUGH AND MAKE GAME OF THE BEAR AND THE BEAR FLEW AT HER AND TORE HER SO THAT THERE WAS SCARCE A RAG OF HER LEFT THEN ALL THE COURT BEGAN TO BEWAIL AND THE CAPTAIN MOST OF ALL
OF THE SUMMERHOUSE IT STOOD UPON BEAMS AND HAD A HIGH STAIRCASE UNDER THAT HE GOT SOME TURF FOR HIS BED AND THERE HE LAY AS WELL AS HE COULD
NEXT DAY THE MAN WENT OUT AGAIN BUT NO ONE WOULD STAND IF THEY HAD TO PAY THE FEES AND THOUGH HE BEGGED AND PRAYED HE COULD GET NO HELP AND AGAIN AS HE WENT HOME TOWARDS EVENING
SO HE RAN DOWN AND TOLD HIS MOTHER WE MUST GET ON MOTHER WE ARE NEAR A HOUSE FOR I SEE A BRIGHT LIGHT SHINING QUITE CLOSE TO US IN THE NORTH THEN SHE ROSE AND SHOULDERED HER BAG AND SET OFF TO SEE
AND THEN HE SAW A TROOP LIKE A WHOLE ARMY BEHIND HIM AND THEY GLISTENED IN THE SUNBEAMS AYE AYE SAID THE HORSE THAT'S THE TROLL AND NOW HE'S GOT HIS WHOLE BAND WITH HIM
THERE HE WAS AND THERE HE MUST STAY AT LAST
NOW WHEN OUR LORD PASSED BY AND SAW THAT HE WENT IN WHO ARE YOU HE SAID TO THE SMITH READ WHAT'S WRITTEN OVER THE DOOR SAID THE SMITH
WELL SAID THE SMITH FIRST AND FOREMOST I WISH THAT ANY ONE WHOM I ASK TO CLIMB UP INTO THE PEAR TREE
I WOULD ASK YOU TO TELL ME IS IT TRUE WHAT PEOPLE SAY THAT THE DEVIL CAN MAKE HIMSELF AS SMALL AS HE PLEASES
HE TOOK WITH HIM A ROPE AND HUNG HIMSELF UP UNDER THE ARM PITS TO A TREE RIGHT IN THE MAN'S WAY SO THE MAN CAME ALONG WITH HIS OX AND WHEN HE SAW SUCH A SIGHT HANGING THERE HE BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE QUEER WELL SAID HE
NAY BUT I CAN'T STEAL SHE SAID BESIDES YOU KNOW HOW IT WENT LAST TIME YOU CAN LEARN THEN SAID HACON AND YOU MAY HAVE BETTER LUCK PERHAPS SHE THOUGHT IT BAD
NOW IN THE CASTLE THERE WAS A BAND THAT PLAYED SWEET TUNES AND THERE WERE FAIR MAIDS TO DANCE WITH AND SO THE LAD DANCED AWAY WHEN TWELVE HOURS WERE GONE THE KING SAID I PITY YOU WITH ALL MY HEART
AND BEGGED THE KING TO LET HIM HAVE AN OLD WORN OUT SUIT THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE FUN OF SEEING SUCH A WRETCH IN BATTLE SO HE GOT THAT AND AN OLD BROKEN DOWN HACK BESIDES WHICH WENT UPON THREE LEGS
THEN THE YOUTH TOOK UP THE SHOE AND MADE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD TO GET BEFORE THE MAN BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE WOOD AND LAID IT DOWN BEFORE HIM IN THE ROAD AGAIN WHEN THE MAN CAME ALONG WITH HIS OX HE GOT QUITE ANGRY WITH HIMSELF FOR BEING SO DULL AS TO LEAVE THE FELLOW TO THE SHOE LYING IN THE ROAD INSTEAD OF TAKING IT WITH HIM
WHAT IT COULD BE HER HUSBAND WAS GATHERING UP OH I KNOW SAID THE LAD MASTER'S PICKING UP STONES I'LL BE BOUND FOR HE HAS MARKED HOW OFTEN THIS TOM TOTHERHOUSE RUNS OVER HERE
YOU'RE SO OLD YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR YOU SAID THE SMITH NOW YOU SHALL BE A LOVELY YOUNG MAIDEN IN HALF NO TIME AND FOR ALL THAT
TWO MEN TO STAND GODFATHERS TOOK THE BABE AND CARRIED IT TO CHURCH
ONE DAY WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM THE PALACE HE SAID TO MORROW I WILL STAY AT HOME AND LOOK AFTER THE BABY
SO HE SOLD THE COCK FOR A SHILLING AND BOUGHT FOOD WITH THE MONEY FOR THOUGHT GUDBRAND ON THE HILL SIDE TIS ALWAYS BETTER TO SAVE ONE'S LIFE THAN TO HAVE A COCK AFTER THAT HE WENT ON HOME TILL HE REACHED HIS NEAREST NEIGHBOUR'S HOUSE WHERE HE TURNED IN
THEY ARE CALLED ANANZI STORIES BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM TURN ON THE FEATS OF ANANZI WHOSE CHARACTER IS A MIXTURE OF THE MASTER THIEF AND OF BOOTS
HE PICKED UP THE BITS OF BROKEN BANNOCK WHICH THE LAD HAD LET FALL HIS OLD DAME STOOD IN THE MEADOW AND LOOKED AT HIM AS HE DID THIS FOR A WHILE AND WONDERED AND WONDERED
BUT SHE HADN'T A SHILLING TO SHEW FOR THE CROWN SHE HAD GOT FROM THE BUTCHER SHE HAD THROWN AWAY IN HER DRUNKENNESS WHEN HER HUSBAND HEARD HER STORY HE SAID YOU'RE ONLY TWICE AS SILLY AS YOU WERE BEFORE AND HE GOT SO ANGRY THAT HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO GO AWAY FROM HER ALTOGETHER
AND BEFORE SHE WENT SHE FORBADE THE LASSIE TO GO INTO THOSE TWO ROOMS INTO WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN SHE PROMISED TO BEWARE BUT WHEN SHE WAS LEFT ALONE
HE FOUND HE COULDN'T GET THE POINT SHARP TILL FOUR YEARS WERE OUT FIRST OF ALL THE DEVIL BEGGED SO PRETTILY TO BE LET OUT OF THE CHAIR AND AFTERWARDS
AND THEN THEY'LL NOT REFUSE TO SLEEP WITH HIM ANY MORE SAID THE PRINCESS SO THE GARDENER TOLD THAT TO THE LAD DO YOU THINK I'LL DO ANY SUCH THING SAID THE LAD WHY THEY'D SAY NEXT THERE WAS SOMETHING BETWEEN ME AND THE PRINCESS
AND HE TOLD HIS FATHER TO GO TO THE SQUIRE AND ASK FOR HIS DAUGHTER FOR HIM IF HE ASKS BY WHAT TRADE I GET MY LIVING YOU CAN SAY I'M A MASTER THIEF I THINK YOU'VE LOST YOUR WITS SAID THE MAN FOR YOU CAN'T BE IN YOUR RIGHT MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF SUCH STUFF
CAN I GET LEAVE TO HAVE A BED AND SHELTER HERE TO NIGHT ASKED THE YOUTH YOU'LL GET NO GOOD BY SLEEPING HERE SAID THE OLD DAME
AND FOLLOW ME WHITHER I WISH TO GO THERE IS STILL A WHOLE HOUR LEFT SO THE LAD WENT THE SAME WAY WHICH THE KING HAD LED HIM THE NIGHT BEFORE AND HE BADE THE KING UNLOCK DOOR AFTER DOOR TILL THEY CAME DOWN TO THE PIER WHICH RAN OUT INTO THE SEA
THE CLARK FAMILY WERE ALL GOING BACK TO JACKSONVILLE TO LIVE DID YOU EVER SEE THE BRIGAND AGAIN ASKED CLOVER WHO HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT EVENTFUL TALE TOLD IN THE PARLOR YES REPLIED IMOGEN
I LIKE THIS SORT OF DAY WHEN NOBODY COMES IN TO INTERRUPT US SOMEBODY TAPPED AT THE DOOR AS SHE SPOKE KATY CALLED OUT COME
WE WANT TO GO BY SASSAFRAS PATH CRIED JOHN AND DORRY HOWEVER KATY AS USUAL HAD HER WAY IT WAS AGREED THAT THEY SHOULD FIRST TRY PILGRIM'S PATH AND AFTERWARD MAKE A THOROUGH EXPLORATION OF THE WHOLE OF THEIR LITTLE KINGDOM
IT WAS A HOT DAY THE SKY WAS VERY BLUE
WHY HOW QUEER SAID KATY TRYING TO GET BY WHAT CAN BE GOING TO HAPPEN OH THERE'S AUNT IZZIE AUNT IZZIE WHO'S COMING WHAT ARE YOU MOVING THE THINGS OUT OF THE BLUE ROOM FOR OH GRACIOUS IS THAT YOU
BUT PAPA SAID WAIT IT WILL TIRE YOU MUCH MORE THAN WALKING ABOUT ON A LEVEL HE EXPLAINED YOU HAD BETTER PUT IT OFF A LITTLE WHILE TILL YOU ARE QUITE SURE OF YOUR FEET I THINK SO TOO SAID CLOVER AND BESIDE
I HAD BUSINESS AT THE BANK CONTINUED THE VISITOR AND I THOUGHT WHILE I WAS ABOUT IT I'D STEP UP TO MISS PETINGILL'S AND SEE IF I COULDN'T GET HER TO COME AND LET OUT MY BLACK SILK IT WAS MADE QUITE A PIECE BACK
ALEX TRIES TO THINK THAT SHE LOOKS A LITTLE AS I USED TO BUT THAT IS A COMPLIMENT SO GREAT THAT I DARE NOT APPROPRIATE IT DOCTOR CARR STOOPED AND KISSED COUSIN HELEN AS IF HE COULD NOT HELP IT MY DEAR CHILD
DO SIT DOWN IMOGEN I'M SORRY NOBODY ANSWERED YOUR RING BUT THE SERVANTS ARE CLEANING HOUSE TO DAY AND I SUPPOSE THEY DIDN'T HEAR SO IMOGEN SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO RATTLE ON IN HER USUAL MANNER
LITTLE PHIL THE YOUNGEST WAS FOUR AND THE REST FITTED IN BETWEEN DOCTOR CARR THEIR PAPA WAS A DEAR KIND BUSY MAN WHO WAS AWAY FROM HOME ALL DAY AND SOMETIMES ALL NIGHT TOO
KISSING HER AND THIS DEAR LITTLE ELSIE YOU ALL LOOK AS NATURAL AS POSSIBLE JUST AS IF I HAD SEEN YOU BEFORE AND SHE HUGGED THEM ALL ROUND
FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER THE LONG WINTER WHO KNEW WHAT THE FAIRIES MIGHT NOT HAVE DONE SINCE ANY OF THEM HAD BEEN THERE TO SEE WHICH PATH SHALL WE GO IN BY ASKED CLOVER AT LAST SUPPOSE WE VOTE SAID KATY
WHEN HE CAME BACK THE CLOCK WAS JUST BEGINNING TO STRIKE THERE HE EXCLAIMED THAT'S SPLENDID ISN'T IT BUT ALAS THE CLOCK DID NOT STOP AT ELEVEN IT WENT ON TWELVE THIRTEEN
WHILE ELSIE DANCED ABOUT CRYING OUT ANXIOUSLY BE CAREFUL DO BE CAREFUL KATY TRIED BUT THE SPRING WAS GONE SHE COULD NOT MOVE OUT OF THE CHAIR AT ALL SHE BEGAN TO WONDER IF SHE HAD DREAMED THE WHOLE THING BUT NEXT DAY
BUT EMMA PERSUADED HIM TO TAKE A FORTNIGHT'S VACATION AND HE CAME BACK ALL RIGHT DO YOU SEE THEM OFTEN ALMOST EVERY DAY
BECAUSE THE TREES AND BUSHES GREW SO CLOSELY THAT YOU COULD NOT SEE JUST WHERE IT ENDED IN WINTER THE GROUND WAS DAMP AND BOGGY SO THAT NOBODY WENT THERE
THE WINDOW ABOVE OPENED A GLAD SHRIEK WAS HEARD AND KATY'S HEAD APPEARED
WHY ELSIE DARLING WHAT'S THE MATTER DON'T CRY SO OH YOU'RE S O BEAUTIFUL AND
REPLIED KATY LAUGHING PRETTY SOON PHILLY CAME UP ESCORTED BY CLOVER HE LOOKED A LITTLE DEFIANT BUT KATY UNDERSTOOD HOW TO MANAGE HIM SHE LIFTED HIM INTO HER LAP WHICH BIG BOY AS HE WAS HE LIKED EXTREMELY
THAT HE FINALLY SAID HE WOULD STAY ESPECIALLY AS THE OTHERS WERE QUITE GRAVE NOW AND PROMISED THAT THEY WOULDN'T LAUGH ANY MORE
SHE SAID AFTER DINNER WHO IS ALEX THAT YOU AND COUSIN HELEN WERE TALKING ABOUT WHY KATY WHAT MAKES YOU WANT TO KNOW I CAN'T EXACTLY TELL ONLY COUSIN HELEN LOOKED SO AND YOU KISSED HER
KATY AND CLOVER HAD PLAYED COUSIN HELEN SO LONG THAT NOW THEY WERE FRIGHTENED AS WELL AS GLAD AT THE IDEA OF SEEING THE REAL ONE
I DON'T BELIEVE THE NEWSPAPERS WOULD BE SO SILLY AS TO PRINT THINGS ABOUT YOU KATY CARR PUT IN ELSIE VINDICTIVELY YES THEY WILL SAID CLOVER AND GAVE ELSIE A PUSH
THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING SO LONG AS I WAS THERE BUT THE MOMENT MY BACK WAS TURNED THEY BEGAN TO QUARREL AGAIN AND IN THE SAME OLD WORDS KATY DID KATY DIDN'T SHE DID SHE DIDN'T
WHICH THE CHILDREN CALLED POLLYPODS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW THE REAL NAME THEY STAID A LONG WHILE PICKING BUNCHES OF THESE FLOWERS AND THEN JOHN AND DORRY HAD TO GRUB UP AN ARMFUL OF SASSAFRAS ROOTS SO THAT BEFORE THEY HAD FAIRLY GONE THROUGH TOADSTOOL AVENUE
AND ELSIE HAD TO MOVE FROM HER SEAT AT THE TABLE OH DEAR SHE SAID
AND YOU WOULDN'T MIND IF THINGS WERE A LITTLE CROOKED JUST AT FIRST WOULD YOU BECAUSE YOU KNOW I SHOULD BE LEARNING ALL THE TIME DO LET ME TRY IT WILL BE REAL NICE TO HAVE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AS I SIT UP HERE ALONE SO MUCH BETTER THAN HAVING A STRANGER IN THE HOUSE WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE CHILDREN OR ANYTHING
CHAPTER TWELVE TWO YEARS AFTERWARD IT WAS A PLEASANT MORNING IN EARLY JUNE A WARM WIND WAS RUSTLING THE TREES WHICH WERE COVERED THICKLY WITH HALF OPENED LEAVES AND LOOKED LIKE FOUNTAINS OF GREEN SPRAY THROWN HIGH INTO THE AIR
YOU WERE REAL GOOD TO DO IT RESPONDED CLOVER BUT IF IT HAD BEEN MINE I DON'T THINK I COULD JUST THEN THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND JOHNNIE RUSHED IN
THIS LITTLE STORY GREW IN MY HEAD AND I RESOLVED TO WRITE IT DOWN FOR YOU I HAVE DONE IT AND IN MEMORY OF MY TWO LITTLE FRIENDS ON THE BULRUSH I GIVE IT THEIR NAME HERE IT IS THE STORY OF WHAT KATY DID
AND TAKE CARE OF HER ALWAYS BUT SHE WOULD NOT CONSENT SHE BROKE THE ENGAGEMENT AND TOLD HIM THAT SOME DAY SHE HOPED HE WOULD LOVE SOMEBODY ELSE WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY HER SO AFTER A GOOD MANY YEARS HE DID
SO THEY MADE HASTE TO BUILD THE BOWER IT DID NOT TAKE LONG
I SHALL HAVE TO TAKE A GOOD REST BEFORE I GO BACK KATY DID TAKE A GOOD REST BUT SHE WAS VERY TIRED NEXT DAY THE EXPERIMENT HOWEVER DID NO HARM IN THE COURSE OF TWO OR THREE WEEKS SHE WAS ABLE TO WALK ALL OVER THE SECOND STORY
I WISH YOU'D SPEAK TO ALEXANDER ABOUT PUTTING THE WOODSHED IN ORDER I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW HOW BAD IT LOOKS I DON'T SUPPOSE I DO SAID KATY SMILING AND THEN SIGHING
KATY RUSHED OFF TO WEEP A LITTLE WEEP ALL BY HERSELF PAPA SAID HE WISHED WE WERE ALL LIKE COUSIN HELEN SHE THOUGHT AS SHE WIPED HER EYES AND I MEAN TO TRY
CONTINUED IMOGEN HM HM HM HIM I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D CARE ABOUT OH YES JUST HERE AT THE END IS SOME POETRY COME LITTLE DOVE WITH AZURE WING
TOOK THE TRAY AND CARRIED IT CAREFULLY ACROSS THE HALL THERE WAS A BOWL OF FLOWERS ON THE TABLE AS SHE PASSED SHE WAS STRUCK WITH A BRIGHT IDEA SHE SET DOWN THE TRAY AND PICKING OUT A ROSE
WHICH HUNG ALMOST OVER THE CHILDREN'S HEADS LET'S PLAY WE'RE GROWN UP SAID CECY AND TELL WHAT WE MEAN TO DO WELL SAID CLOVER YOU BEGIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN TO DO
QUESTIONED CECY I DON'T BELIEVE COUSIN HELEN COULD DO ANYTHING WICKED SAID KATY I TOLD MA THAT SHE HAD ON BRACELETS AND MA SAID SHE FEARED YOUR COUSIN WAS A WORLDLY PERSON RETORTED CECY PRIMMING UP HER LIPS
FOR TO THE IMAGINATIONS OF THE CHILDREN COUSIN HELEN WAS AS INTERESTING AND UNREAL AS ANYBODY IN THE FAIRY TALES CINDERELLA OR BLUE BEARD OR DEAR RED RIDING HOOD HERSELF ONLY
HAD IT TWO YEARS DIDN'T I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT IT PERHAPS YOU DID KATY WOULD REPLY BUT YOU SEE I NEVER SAW IT BEFORE SO IT MADE NO IMPRESSION BY THE END OF AUGUST SHE WAS GROWN SO STRONG THAT SHE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT GOING DOWN STAIRS
AND RELATIONS GENERALLY AS THEY DID THEIR OTHER GOOD THINGS NEXT DAY CAME THE SAD PARTING ALL THE LITTLE ONES STOOD AT THE GATE TO WAVE THEIR POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS AS THE CARRIAGE DROVE AWAY WHEN IT WAS QUITE OUT OF SIGHT
WHILE JOHN AND DORRY EXECUTED A SORT OF WAR DANCE ROUND THE SOFA PHIL'S VOICE SEEMED TO BREAK THE SPELL OF SILENCE AND A PERFECT HUBBUB OF QUESTIONS AND EXCLAMATIONS BEGAN IT APPEARED THAT THIS HAPPY THOUGHT OF GETTING COUSIN HELEN TO THE CELEBRATION WAS CLOVER'S
SKIPPING ABOUT AND CLAPPING HER HANDS I NEVER NEVER NEVER DID HEAR OF ANYTHING SO PERFECTLY LOVELY PAPA WHEN ARE YOU COMING DOWN STAIRS
AND DEAR OLD MARY WITH HER APRON AT HER EYES CRYING FOR JOY OH THE FRONT DOOR IS OPEN SAID KATY IN A DELIGHTED TONE HOW NICE AND WHAT A PRETTY OIL CLOTH THAT'S NEW SINCE I WAS HERE
AND KATY WITH THEM SHE BEGAN TO CROCHET AND TO READ AFTER A WHILE SHE COLLECTED HER BOOKS AGAIN AND TRIED TO STUDY AS COUSIN HELEN HAD ADVISED BUT SO MANY IDLE WEEKS MADE IT SEEM HARDER WORK THAN EVER ONE DAY SHE ASKED PAPA TO LET HER TAKE FRENCH LESSONS
WITHOUT LASTING MISCHIEF WHATEVER WERE HIS INSTRUMENTS NO LASTING MISCHIEF HAS ENSUED AND THEREFORE HOWEVER UNUSUAL IN HANDS SO CAUTIOUS THEY WERE PROPER
IRREGULARLY WITH THE MOVEABLES OF A PERSON DECEASED WAS SUBJECTED TO ALL THE DEBTS OF THE DECEASED WITHOUT LIMITATION THIS MAKES A BRANCH OF THE LAW OF SCOTLAND KNOWN BY THE NAME OF VICIOUS INTROMISSION
ARE INTRODUCED INTO THE HUMAN FRAME BY THE MEDIUM OF THE PORES AND THEREFORE WHEN WARM WATER IS IMPREGNATED WITH SALUTIFEROUS SUBSTANCES IT MAY PRODUCE GREAT EFFECTS AS A BATH THIS APPEARED TO ME VERY SATISFACTORY JOHNSON
I REGRETTED THE REFLECTION IN HIS PREFACE TO SHAKSPEARE AGAINST GARRICK TO WHOM
THAT DOCTOR JOHNSON'S FAVOURABLE OPINION OF ANY BOOK MUST GIVE ME GREAT DELIGHT INDEED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO SAY HOW MUCH I AM GRATIFIED BY IT
HE GOES ON WITHOUT KNOWING HOW HE IS TO GET OFF HIS GENIUS IS GREAT BUT HIS KNOWLEDGE IS SMALL AS THEY SAY OF A GENEROUS MAN IT IS A PITY HE IS NOT RICH WE MAY SAY OF GOLDSMITH
ONE OF THAT HONOURABLE BODY HAD CRITICAL SAGACITY ENOUGH TO DISCOVER A MORE THAN ORDINARY HAND IN THE PETITION I TOLD HIM DOCTOR JOHNSON
AND THEREFORE TELL YOU NOW THAT WITH GREAT SINCERITY I WISH YOU HAPPINESS I AM DEAR SIR YOUR MOST AFFECTIONATE HUMBLE SERVANT SAM JOHNSON NOVEMBER NINE SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE I WAS DETAINED IN TOWN TILL IT WAS TOO LATE ON THE NINTH
AND FACILITY I THEREFORE RETURN TO MY ORIGINAL POSITION THAT A LAW TO HAVE ITS EFFECT MUST BE PERMANENT AND STABLE IT MAY BE SAID IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE SCHOOLS
I THUS VENTURED TO MENTION ALL THE COMMON OBJECTIONS AGAINST THE ROMAN CATHOLICK CHURCH THAT I MIGHT HEAR SO GREAT A MAN UPON THEM
AND WASH IT MUCH AND WITH WARM WATER TO PLEASE IT NOT WITH COLD WATER TO GIVE IT PAIN BOSWELL BUT SIR DOES NOT HEAT RELAX JOHNSON SIR YOU ARE NOT TO IMAGINE THE WATER IS TO BE VERY HOT I WOULD NOT CODDLE THE CHILD
WOULD NOT YOU HAVE A PLEASURE IN TEACHING IT JOHNSON NO SIR I SHOULD NOT HAVE A PLEASURE IN TEACHING IT BOSWELL HAVE YOU NOT A PLEASURE IN TEACHING MEN THERE I HAVE YOU YOU HAVE THE SAME PLEASURE IN TEACHING MEN THAT I SHOULD HAVE IN TEACHING CHILDREN
FOR ALTHOUGH WHEN IN A CELESTIAL FRAME IN HIS VANITY OF HUMAN WISHES HE HAS SUPPOSED DEATH TO BE KIND NATURE'S SIGNAL FOR RETREAT
OF OUR FRIEND GOLDSMITH HE SAID SIR HE IS SO MUCH AFRAID OF BEING UNNOTICED THAT HE OFTEN TALKS MERELY LEST YOU SHOULD FORGET
WELL SIR YOU ARE NOW IN GOOD HUMOUR JOHNSON YES SIR I WAS GOING TO LEAVE HIM AND HAD GOT AS FAR AS THE STAIRCASE HE STOPPED ME AND SMILING SAID GET YOU GONE IN
IF IT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE ENMITY OF THEIR FATHERS PROVES THE JUSTICE OF THE CHARGE IT MUST BE CONSIDERED HOW OFTEN EXPERIENCE SHEWS US THAT MEN WHO ARE ANGRY ON ONE GROUND
MY DEAR SIR EDINBURGH DECEMBER TWENTY FIFTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO I WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU DID NOT COME TO SCOTLAND LAST AUTUMN HOWEVER I MUST OWN THAT YOUR LETTER PREVENTS ME FROM COMPLAINING
FULL OF DISMAL APPREHENSIONS HIS MIND RESEMBLED THE VAST AMPHITHEATRE THE COLISAEUM AT ROME IN THE CENTRE STOOD HIS JUDGEMENT WHICH LIKE A MIGHTY GLADIATOR COMBATED THOSE APPREHENSIONS THAT LIKE THE WILD BEASTS OF THE ARENA
YOU WILL FIND THESE VERY FEELING PEOPLE ARE NOT VERY READY TO DO YOU GOOD THEY PAY YOU BY FEELING BOSWELL FOOTE HAS A GREAT DEAL OF HUMOUR JOHNSON YES SIR BOSWELL
A THING WHICH MEN DISLIKE BEFORE THEY HAVE TRIED IT AND WHEN THEY HAVE TRIED IT BOSWELL BUT SIR THE MIND MUST BE EMPLOYED AND WE GROW WEARY WHEN IDLE JOHNSON THAT IS SIR BECAUSE OTHERS BEING BUSY WE WANT COMPANY
BUT SIR IS IT NOT BETTER THAT TENANTS SHOULD BE DEPENDANT ON LANDLORDS JOHNSON WHY SIR AS THERE ARE MANY MORE TENANTS THAN LANDLORDS PERHAPS STRICTLY SPEAKING WE SHOULD WISH NOT
WHICH PROVED IN MANY INSTANCES A MOST RIGOROUS PUNISHMENT
AND FOLLOWED IN A PLACE LIKE CAMPBELLTOWN IT IS EASY FOR ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL INHABITANTS TO MAKE A PARTY IT IS EASY FOR THAT PARTY TO HEAT THEMSELVES WITH IMAGINARY GRIEVANCES IT IS EASY FOR THEM
AND YET YOU MAY HAVE REASON TO CONSIDER YOURSELF AS UPON THE WHOLE VERY HAPPILY MARRIED TALKING OF MARRIAGE IN GENERAL HE OBSERVED OUR MARRIAGE SERVICE IS TOO REFINED IT IS CALCULATED ONLY FOR THE BEST KIND OF MARRIAGES
BY ALLEDGING THAT HE HAS LOST THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF JURIDICAL CONSIDERATION
ON SATURDAY APRIL ELEVENTH HE APPOINTED ME TO COME TO HIM IN THE EVENING WHEN HE SHOULD BE AT LEISURE TO GIVE ME SOME ASSISTANCE FOR THE DEFENCE OF HASTIE THE SCHOOLMASTER OF CAMPBELLTOWN FOR WHOM I WAS TO APPEAR IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS
WHY SIR MOST SCHEMES OF POLITICAL IMPROVEMENT ARE VERY LAUGHABLE THINGS HE OBSERVED PROVIDENCE HAS WISELY ORDERED THAT THE MORE NUMEROUS MEN ARE THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THEM TO AGREE IN ANY THING AND SO THEY ARE GOVERNED
TO GIVE TO ONE MAN WHAT IN THE SAME CASE IS GIVEN TO ANOTHER THE ADVANTAGE WHICH HUMANITY DERIVES FROM LAW IS THIS THAT THE LAW GIVES EVERY MAN A RULE OF ACTION AND
BUT IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT IF ONE HAD TAKEN THE OTHER SIDE HE MIGHT HAVE REASONED DIFFERENTLY I MUST HOWEVER MENTION THAT HE HAD A RESPECT FOR THE OLD RELIGION
IS THE PROPER ACT OF VINDICTIVE JUSTICE BUT TO PREVENT FRAUDS AND MAKE PUNISHMENT UNNECESSARY IS THE GREAT EMPLOYMENT OF LEGISLATIVE WISDOM TO PERMIT INTROMISSION
OR CONTINUE TO INHABIT THE PLACE IN WHICH THEY WERE BRED THOSE WHO ARE DISPERSED CANNOT BE FOUND THOSE WHO REMAIN ARE THE SONS OF HIS PERSECUTORS AND ARE NOT LIKELY TO SUPPORT A MAN TO WHOM THEIR FATHERS ARE ENEMIES
AND THREATEN TO KILL THEM AND YOU'LL SEE HOW THEY BEHAVE BOSWELL
JOHNSON WHY SIR THE PRESBYTERIANS HAVE NO CHURCH NO APOSTOLICAL ORDINATION BOSWELL AND DO YOU THINK THAT ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL SIR JOHNSON WHY SIR AS IT WAS AN APOSTOLICAL INSTITUTION I THINK IT IS DANGEROUS TO BE WITHOUT IT
EVEN WHILE HE WAS EXERTING HIMSELF FOR ITS REFORMATION IN SOME PARTICULARS SIR WILLIAM SCOTT INFORMS ME THAT HE HEARD JOHNSON SAY A MAN WHO IS CONVERTED FROM PROTESTANTISM TO POPERY MAY BE SINCERE HE PARTS WITH NOTHING
BY WHICH THE DEFICIENCIES OF PRIVATE UNDERSTANDING ARE TO BE SUPPLIED IT IS TO SUFFER THE RASH AND IGNORANT TO ACT AT DISCRETION AND THEN TO DEPEND FOR THE LEGALITY OF THAT ACTION ON THE SENTENCE OF THE JUDGE
HE THAT IS THUS GOVERNED LIVES NOT BY LAW BUT BY OPINION NOT BY A CERTAIN RULE TO WHICH HE CAN APPLY HIS INTENTION BEFORE HE ACTS
TWO CONDITIONS ARE NECESSARY AND TWO PROPER IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE LAW SHOULD BE ADEQUATE TO ITS END THAT IF IT BE OBSERVED IT SHALL PREVENT THE EVIL AGAINST WHICH IT IS DIRECTED
WHEREAS WE SHOULD HAVE A FORM FOR MATCHES OF CONVENIENCE OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY HE AGREED WITH ME THAT THERE WAS NO ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR HAVING THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY PERFORMED BY A REGULAR CLERGYMAN FOR THIS WAS NOT COMMANDED IN SCRIPTURE
Q DEAR SIR THE REGRET HAS NOT BEEN LITTLE WITH WHICH I HAVE MISSED A JOURNEY SO PREGNANT WITH PLEASING EXPECTATIONS AS THAT IN WHICH I COULD PROMISE MYSELF NOT ONLY THE GRATIFICATION OF CURIOSITY BOTH RATIONAL AND FANCIFUL
WILL ACCUSE ON ANOTHER WITH HOW LITTLE KINDNESS IN A TOWN OF LOW TRADE A MAN WHO LIVES BY LEARNING IS REGARDED AND HOW IMPLICITLY WHERE THE INHABITANTS ARE NOT VERY RICH A RICH MAN IS HEARKENED TO
IT IS SECONDLY NECESSARY THAT THE END OF THE LAW BE OF SUCH IMPORTANCE AS TO DESERVE THE SECURITY OF A PENAL SANCTION THE OTHER CONDITIONS OF A PENAL LAW WHICH THOUGH NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
BEFORE THE FEROCITY OF THE INHABITANTS OF THIS PART OF THE ISLAND WAS SUBDUED THE UTMOST SEVERITY OF THE CIVIL LAW WAS NECESSARY TO RESTRAIN INDIVIDUALS FROM PLUNDERING EACH OTHER THUS THE MAN WHO INTERMEDDLED
WHETHER I SHOULD WISH TO HAVE A FRIEND BY ME OR HAVE IT ALL BETWEEN GOD AND MYSELF TALKING OF OUR FEELING FOR THE DISTRESSES OF OTHERS JOHNSON
NO SIR THE HARDY METHOD OF TREATING CHILDREN DOES NO GOOD I'LL TAKE YOU FIVE CHILDREN FROM LONDON WHO SHALL CUFF FIVE HIGHLAND CHILDREN SIR A MAN BRED IN LONDON WILL CARRY A BURTHEN OR RUN OR WRESTLE
NO SIR THEIR AFFECTION FOR THEIR OLD DWELLINGS AND THE TERROUR OF A GENERAL CHANGE KEEP THEM AT HOME THUS WE SEE MANY OF THE FINEST SPOTS IN THE WORLD THINLY INHABITED AND MANY RUGGED SPOTS WELL INHABITED
NOW TENANTS WILL NOT GIVE MORE FOR LAND THAN LAND IS WORTH IF THEY CAN MAKE MORE OF THEIR MONEY BY KEEPING A SHOP OR ANY OTHER WAY THEY'LL DO IT
AS THE LAW HAS BEEN SOMETIMES ADMINISTERED IT LAYS US OPEN TO WOUNDS BECAUSE IT IS IMAGINED TO HAVE THE POWER OF HEALING TO PUNISH FRAUD WHEN IT IS DETECTED
YOU WANT TO SEE MISTER DUNBAR HE SAID
TO THROW THE BANKER COMPLETELY OFF HIS GUARD AND TO BRING ABOUT THE LONG DELAYED INTERVIEW BETWEEN HIM AND MARGARET WILMOT CLEMENT RETURNED TO THE REINDEER HAD A BRIEF CONVERSATION WITH MARGARET AND MADE ALL ARRANGEMENTS
YOU'RE RATHER MORE LIKELY TO HINDER THAN HELP SIR MISTER CARTER ANSWERED WITH A SMILE BUT YOU'RE WELCOME TO HAVE A FINGER IN THE PIE IF YOU LIKE AS LONG AS YOU'LL ENGAGE TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE WHEN I TELL YOU CLEMENT PROMISED TO BE THE VERY SPIRIT OF DISCRETION
YOU'RE A CLEVER FELLOW DEAR FRIEND HE MUTTERED AS HE LIGHTED HIS CIGAR YOU'RE A STUPENDOUS FELLOW DEAR BOY BUT YOUR FRIEND CAN SEE THROUGH LESS TRANSPARENT BLINDS THAN THIS DIAMOND BUSINESS
AH MARGARET YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN MY LOVE ALL ALONG YOU WOULD HAVE BANISHED ME HAD YOU FELT THAT MY LOVE WAS HOPELESS
THEN HE PUT THE CHAMOIS LEATHER BELT UNDER HIS PILLOW AND WENT TO BED
EVERY ONE OF THESE CANVAS BAGS WAS FULL OF LOOSE DIAMONDS A THRILL OF RAPTURE RAN THROUGH THE BANKER'S VEINS AS HE PLUNGED HIS FINGERS IN AMONGST THE GLITTERING STONES HE FILLED HIS HANDS WITH THE BRIGHT GEMS AND LET THEM RUN FROM ONE HAND TO THE OTHER LIKE STREAMS OF LIQUID LIGHT THEN
IN A MANNER DISORGANIZED BY THE ADVENT OF A LADY SHE IS A VERY YOUNG LADY BEING IN POINT OF FACT STILL AT A REMOTE DISTANCE FROM AN EPOCH TO WHICH SHE APPEARS TO LOOK FORWARD AS A GRAND AND ENVIABLE PERIOD OF EXISTENCE
IT MAY HAVE BEEN WRITTEN AT HENRY DUNBAR'S DICTATION AND UNDER COERCION BE IT AS IT MAY THE MYSTERY OF THE WINCHESTER MURDER SHALL BE SET AT REST IF PATIENCE OR INTELLIGENCE CAN SOLVE THE ENIGMA NO MYSTERY SHALL SEPARATE ME FROM THE WOMAN I LOVE
MARGARET WILMOT WATCHED HIM WITH EAGER SCRUTINIZING EYES SHE SAW DOUBT PERPLEXITY HORROR INDECISION ALL STRUGGLING IN HIS HANDSOME FACE BUT THE LAWYER FELT THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO ACT
HE SAID RESPECTFULLY A YOUNG PERSON EXCLAIMED MISTER DUNBAR IMPATIENTLY I CAN'T SEE ANY ONE WHAT SHOULD ANY YOUNG PERSON WANT WITH ME SHE WANTS TO SEE YOU PARTICULARLY SIR SHE SAYS HER NAME IS WILMOT
CHAPTER EIGHT THE FIRST STAGE ON THE JOURNEY HOME JOSEPH WILMOT OBEYED HIS OLD MASTER AND ORDERED A VERY EXCELLENT LUNCHEON WHICH WAS SERVED IN THE BEST STYLE OF THE DOLPHIN
BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THIS CLEMENT WAS DETERMINED TO WAIT NO LONGER HE WOULD GO TO THE ABBEY AT ONCE AND ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE OF MARGARET'S DELAY HE RANG THE BELL WENT INTO THE PARK
EVERYTHING WAS OBSCURED BY THAT CRUEL RAIN THE WATER GUSHED OUT OF THE QUAINT DRAGONS MOUTHS RANGED ALONG THE PARAPET OF THE ABBEY ROOF IT DRIPPED FROM EVERY STONE COPING AND ABUTMENT FROM WINDOW LEDGE AND PORCH FROM GABLE END AND SHELTERING IVY
THIS WAS THE BOOK THE BANKER HAD BEEN STUDYING ALL THAT WINTER'S DAY AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE NEXT DAY HE ORDERED A BROUGHAM AND WAS DRIVEN TO THE BANKING HOUSE IN SAINT GUNDOLPH LANE THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT HENRY DUNBAR HAD VISITED THE HOUSE IN SAINT GUNDOLPH LANE SINCE HIS RETURN FROM INDIA
I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY OF CALLING BUT I FEAR I HAVE CHOSEN AN INCONVENIENT TIME FOR MY VISIT I SCARCELY KNOW WHY I MADE THIS APOLOGY SINCE I HAD OMITTED TO APOLOGIZE TO THE OTHER LADIES ON WHOM I HAD VENTURED TO INTRUDE AT ABNORMAL HOURS
SHE HAS NOT YET ENTERED WHAT SHE CALLS HER TEENS AND TWO YEARS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE SHE CAN ENTER THEM AS SHE IS ONLY ELEVEN YEARS OLD SHE IS THE ONLY DAUGHTER OF MY ONLY SISTER MARIAN LESTER AND HAS BEEN NEWLY IMPORTED FROM SYDNEY
AND DON'T YOU FRET YOUR PRECIOUS HEART MY BLESSED MISS LAURA IF THE RAIN IS CONTRAIRY
TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTERWARDS MISTER DUNBAR COULD FIND NO DESIGN THAT SUITED HIM AND THE MAN RETURNED TO LONDON WITHOUT HAVING RECEIVED AN ORDER AND WITHOUT HAVING EVEN SEEN THE BRILLIANTS WHICH THE BANKER HAD BOUGHT TELL YOUR EMPLOYER THAT I WILL RETAIN TWO OR THREE OF THESE DESIGNS
AND CRIED TO US FOR VENGEANCE CLEMENT THOUGHT THERE WILL BE NO PEACE FOR US UNTIL THE SECRET OF THE DEED DONE IN THE GROVE NEAR WINCHESTER HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT THIS THOUGHT WORKING NIGHT AND DAY IN CLEMENT AUSTIN'S BRAIN GAVE RISE TO A FIXED RESOLVE
AND I FANCY THAT A DEEPENING SHADOW STEALS OVER HER FACE WHEN SHE MENTIONS THAT NAME FRIENDLY AS WE ARE I CAN NEVER INDUCE HER TO LET ME SEE HER HOME THOUGH MY MOTHER HAS SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD DO SO
IN SPITE OF THE GRAND CAPABILITIES FOR FALSEHOOD AND HYPOCRISY WHICH HAD BEEN DEVELOPED IN MY NATURE SINCE THE PREVIOUS EVENING IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO TO ANSWER MY MOTHER'S QUESTION DELIBERATELY TO THE EFFECT THAT I DIDN'T THINK I SHOULD MIND THE MUSIC LESSONS
READ IT SHE SAID YOU WILL SEE THEN HOW MY FATHER HAD BEEN WRONGED BY HENRY DUNBAR ARTHUR LOVELL UNFOLDED THE WORN AND FADED LETTER IT HAD BEEN WRITTEN FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS BEFORE BY SAMPSON WILMOT
IN SOME AWKWARD VAGUE MANNER WHO I WAS AND HOW IT WAS I WANTED TO ENGAGE HER SERVICES THROUGHOUT THAT INTERVIEW I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN INTOXICATED BY HER PRESENCE AS BY SOME SUBTLE AND MYSTERIOUS INFLUENCE STRONGER THAN THE FUMES OF OPIUM OR THE JUICE OF LOTUS FLOWERS
I HAVE NOT YET RECOVERED FROM THE SHOCK OF THAT HORRIBLE BUSINESS AT WINCHESTER GO AND TELL MARGARET WILMOT THIS TELL HER THAT I WILL BE HER TRUE FRIEND IF SHE WILL ACCEPT THAT FRIENDSHIP BUT THAT I WILL NOT SEE HER UNTIL SHE HAS LEARNED TO THINK BETTER OF ME
AND WENT ON STARING AT THE ROOKS WITHOUT TROUBLING HIMSELF ANY FURTHER ABOUT THE IMPERTINENT YOUNG PERSON WHO HAD DARED TO PRESENT HERSELF AT THE GRAND ENTRANCE MARGARET OPENED THE DOOR
HE STOPPED AT THE GATE OF THE PRINCIPAL LODGE THE WOMAN WHO KEPT IT WAS AN OLD SERVANT OF THE DUNBAR FAMILY AND HAD KNOWN CLEMENT AUSTIN IN PERCIVAL DUNBAR'S LIFETIME SHE GAVE HIM A HEARTY WELCOME
I TOLD MY DEAR MOTHER THAT MISS WENTWORTH'S HEAD WAS FROM A PHRENOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW MAGNIFICENT AND THAT THE ORGANS OF TIME AND TUNE WERE DEVELOPED TO AN UNUSUAL DEGREE
MISTER DUNBAR MURDERED MY FATHER SHE SAID AFTER THIS HAD BEEN DONE AND HE'S AFRAID TO SEE ME
IT MAY BE THAT THE SEAL OF OLD BACHELORHOOD IS ALREADY SET UPON ME AND THAT I AM THAT ODIOUS AND HYPER SENSITIVE CREATURE COMMONLY CALLED A FIDGET
AND THIS LANGUID FOOTMAN LOLLING IN THE PORCH SUDDENLY INSPIRED MARGARET WILMOT WITH A NEW IDEA WOULD IT NOT BE POSSIBLE TO SLIP QUIETLY PAST THIS MAN AND WALK STRAIGHT TO THE APARTMENTS OF MISTER DUNBAR
BUT BY SOME STRANGE DEVILRY OR OTHER PECULIAR TO THE INCIDENTS OF A DREAM IT HAD BEEN ALWAYS HIDDEN FROM HER THE SAME WAITER WAS LOUNGING IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AT THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL HE LOOKED UP WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SURPRISE AS MARGARET APPROACHED HIM
I HAD TAKEN SOME SLIGHT REFRESHMENT TO THIS HOUR I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS I ATE UPON THAT BALMY SUMMER EVENING SO ENTIRELY WAS MY MIND ABSORBED BY THAT BRIGHT HOPE WHICH WAS GROWING BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER EVERY MOMENT
SET MY FACE TOWARDS THE YELLOW LIGHT IN THE WEST AND WALKED ACROSS WANDSWORTH COMMON
GOOD MORNING MAJOR VERNON HAD RETURNED TO THE ROSE AND CROWN AT LISFORD THE DEED WHICH TRANSFERRED TO HIM THE POSSESSION OF WOODBINE COTTAGE WAS SPEEDILY EXECUTED AND HE TOOK UP HIS ABODE THERE HIS ESTABLISHMENT WAS COMPOSED OF THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER WHO HAD WAITED ON THE DECEASED ADMIRAL
AND ALL THAT DAY THE BANKER OCCUPIED HIMSELF IN READING A MOROCCO BOUND MANUSCRIPT VOLUME WHICH HE TOOK FROM THE DESPATCH BOX THERE WAS A BLACK FOG UPON THIS NOVEMBER DAY AND THE ATMOSPHERE OUT OF DOORS WAS COLD AND BLEAK BUT THE ROOM IN WHICH HENRY DUNBAR SAT LOOKED THE VERY PICTURE OF COMFORT AND ELEGANCE
THERE WERE LAMPS HERE AND THERE BUT THEY ONLY MADE SEPARATE SPLOTCHES OF LIGHT IN THE DUSKY ATMOSPHERE HENRY DUNBAR WALKED SLOWLY UP AND DOWN THE PLATFORM
THE SKY THAT SHUTS IN THE LAWN YONDER SEEMS TO SHUT IN MY LIFE WITH IT I CAN'T LOOK FORWARD IF I WAS GOING TO BE PARTED FROM PHILIP TO DAY INSTEAD OF MARRIED TO HIM I DON'T THINK I COULD FEEL MORE MISERABLE THAN I FEEL NOW WHY IS IT ELIZABETH DEAR
AND THE SPECIAL FRIENDS OF MISS DUNBAR THEY HAD COME TO MAUDESLEY TO ACT AS HER BRIDESMAIDS ACCORDING TO THAT FAVOURITE PROMISE WHICH YOUNG LADIES SO OFTEN MAKE TO EACH OTHER AND SO VERY OFTEN BREAK LAURA DID NOT APPEAR TO TAKE MUCH INTEREST IN THE MISS MELVILLES HAIR
THE INCESSANT RAIN DROPS DRIPPED FROM THE LOW BRANCHES OF THE BLACK SPREADING CEDARS OF LEBANON THE SMOOTH BEADS OF WATER RAN OFF THE SHINING LAUREL LEAVES THE RHODODENDRONS THE FEATHERY FURZE
AND THEN MY MOTHER ASKED ME WHY IN THAT CASE DID I CONSIDER THE LADY SUITABLE WHICH QUESTION INCREASED MY EMBARRASSMENT BY TENFOLD
MUCH YOU'LL BE OUT GENERALLY YOU KNOW CLEM MY MOTHER SAID YES I REPLIED OF COURSE IF I FOUND THE MUSIC IN ANY WAY A NUISANCE
I SHALL BE HAPPY TO SEE YOU AT THE CLARENDON IF YOU WILL DINE WITH ME ANY EVENING THAT YOU ARE DISENGAGED THERE WAS VERY LITTLE HEARTINESS IN THE TONE OF THIS INVITATION AND MISTER BALDERBY PERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS ONLY A FORMULA WHICH MISTER DUNBAR FELT HIMSELF CALLED UPON TO GO THROUGH
SUGGESTED A MOTIVE THE YOUNG LAWYER DROPPED INTO A CHAIR AND SAT FOR SOME MINUTES SILENTLY PORING OVER THE CLERK'S LETTER HE DID NOT LIKE HENRY DUNBAR HIS GENEROUS YOUNG HEART
AND HE FELT LIKE AN OLD MAN WHO HAS LOST ALL THE BRIGHT CHANCES OF EXISTENCE THE HOPE OF DOMESTIC HAPPINESS AND A PLEASANT HOME THE OPPORTUNITY OF A USEFUL CAREER AND AN HONOURED NAME
THE INFORMATION THAT THE SEAL OF THE LETTER WAS UNBROKEN WAS NOW A FURTHER CONFIRMATION HAD HE NEEDED IT AT LEAST IT CONFIRMED THAT THE LETTER HAD NOT BEEN OPENED AFTER IT LEFT THE OFFICE MISTER GALLOWAY PERFECTLY REMEMBERED FASTENING DOWN THE LETTER
BUT IT IS A DREADFUL PLAGUE SHE GRUMBLED TO BE OBLIGED TO GET UP FROM ONE'S NICE WARM BED FOR THE SAKE OF SOME HORRID OLD LESSONS YOU SPOKE OF THE POOR' THOSE WHO HAVE THEIR LIVING TO EARN' AS THE ONLY CLASS WHO NEED RISE EARLY RESUMED CONSTANCE
MISTER GALLOWAY SAT DRUMMING ON HIS DESK APPARENTLY GAZING AT ROLAND IN REALITY THINKING TO HEAR THAT MISTER ROLAND YORKE HAD TAKEN FRENCH LEAVE FOR NEARLY A WHOLE AFTERNOON
HE SAT ON PRETTY PATIENTLY FOR HIM ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND THEN TOOK THE LIBERTY OF REPLENISHING THE FIRE FROM A COAL BOX THAT STOOD THERE ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR WAS PASSED MUCH MORE IMPATIENTLY WHEN KETCH BEGAN TO GROW UNEASY AND LOSE HIMSELF IN ALL SORTS OF GRAVE CONJECTURES
NOTHING HOWEVER APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN TOUCHED OR DISTURBED AND THERE WAS NO SOOT ON THE FLOOR CUTTING HIMSELF A PIECE OF BREAD AND CHEESE LAMENTING AT ITS DRYNESS AND EATING IT AS HE WENT ALONG HE PROCEEDED OUT AGAIN LOCKING UP HIS LODGE AS BEFORE
IF I DO GO I KNEW HOW LONG IT WOULD LAST LADY AUGUSTA'S INSTRUCTING THEM HERSELF RESUMED MISTER YORKE IT IS NOT A MONTH SINCE THE GOVERNESS LEFT
THERE'S NOTHING I HAVE SUCH A HATRED TO AS TRIPE AND HE KNOWS IT IS THIS THE WAY TO TREAT A MAN FOAMED KETCH DISAPPOINTMENT AND HUNGER DRIVING HIM ALMOST INTO THE STATE HINTED AT BY MISSUS JENKINS
I DO NOT WISH TO FORCE YOU TO OBEY ME I WOULD PREFER THAT YOU SHOULD DO IT CHEERFULLY IT IS TIRESOME TO GET UP EARLY RESPONDED CAROLINE I CAN'T WAKE WHEN MARTHA COMES
I WONDER WHAT HE'LL PRETEND HE HAS NEXT FROM YOU A NOTE OF INVITATION INDEED MY DEAR SAID JENKINS REVOLVING THE NEWS AND SPEAKING AS WELL AS HIS CHEST WOULD ALLOW HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN A TRICK PLAYED HIM BY THE YOUNG COLLEGE GENTLEMEN WE SHOULD NOT BE TOO HARD UPON THE POOR OLD MAN
HOW MANY PEOPLE CALLED IN WHILE CHANNING WAS AT COLLEGE AND YOU WERE KEEPING OFFICE DEMANDED MISTER GALLOWAY ROLAND FIDGETED FIRST ON ONE LEG THEN ON THE OTHER HE FELT THAT IT MUST ALL COME OUT WHAT A PASSION HE'LL GO INTO WITH ME THOUGHT ROLAND
BUT THEN GOOD RESOLUTIONS WERE FORGOTTEN AND IDLENESS FOLLOWED NOT ONLY IDLENESS TEMPER ALSO
BUT TO SAY HE TURNED HIS EYES UPON THE CLOISTER KEYS IS A MERE FIGURE OF SPEECH NO KEYS WERE THERE KETCH STOOD A STATUE TRANSFIXED AND STARED AS HARD AS THE FLICKERING BLAZE FROM HIS DYING FIRE WOULD ALLOW HIM
HE'S NOT VERY AGREEABLE OR GOOD TEMPERED I'M AFRAID IT MUST BE ALLOWED BUT I'D NOT HAVE SENT HIM AWAY WITHOUT A BIT OF SUPPER MY DEAR I DARE SAY YOU'D NOT RETORTED MISSUS JENKINS ALL THE WORLD KNOWS YOU ARE SOFT ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING I HAVE SENT HIM AWAY WITH A FLEA IN HIS EAR
CONSTANCE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE COMMENCED THE DAILY ROUTINE AT AN EARLIER HOUR LADY AUGUSTA FREELY CONFESSED THAT TO COME EARLIER WOULD BE USELESS FOR SHE COULD NOT GET HER DAUGHTERS UP STRICTLY SPEAKING LADY AUGUSTA DID NOT PERSONALLY TRY TO GET THEM UP
LADY AUGUSTA SCOLDED THEM FOR THEIR LATE APPEARANCE FORGETTING POSSIBLY THAT SHE HERSELF SET THE EXAMPLE IT IS NOT MUCH PAST TEN SAID CAROLINE WE SHALL BE IN TIME FOR COLLEGE IT IS NEARLY UPON HALF PAST REPLIED LADY AUGUSTA
IT HAD BEEN HIS INVARIABLE CUSTOM TO TAKE THE READING HIMSELF ON SUNDAY THE LITTLE TIME HE DEVOTED TO RELIGION AND HE WAS UNWILLING TO BREAK THROUGH IT BREAKFAST OVER IT WAS IMMEDIATELY ENTERED UPON AND WOULD BE FINISHED BY TEN O'CLOCK
A PRETTY THING TO INVITE A GENTLEMAN OUT TO AN IMPROMPTU SUPPER AND SERVE HIM IN THIS WAY WHAT COULD THEY MEAN BY IT HE GROPED HIS WAY ROUND THE CORNER OF THE SHOP TO WHERE LAY THE KITCHEN STAIRS WHOSE POSITION HE PRETTY WELL KNEW AND CALLED HERE SALLY BETTY
LADY AUGUSTA CAME IN AND PROFFERED THE INVITATION TO CONSTANCE TO ACCOMPANY THEM CONSTANCE THEN SPOKE OF GIVING THE CHILDREN THE EXTRA TWO HOURS FROM SEVEN TO NINE IT WAS REALLY NECESSARY SHE SAID IF SHE WAS TO DO HER DUTY BY THEM
COLLEGE BOYS CRIED HIS LORDSHIP WINKING AND BLINKING AS OTHER LESS MAJESTIC MORTALS DO WHEN AWAKENED SUDDENLY OUT OF THEIR MORNING SLEEP YES MY LORD REPLIED THE SERVANT ALL THE SCHOOL'S COME UP SUCH A LOT OF EM
CONSTANCE THAT IS NO ANSWER OH DO NOT DO NOT WILLIAM DO NOT YOU THROW THIS TEMPTATION IN MY WAY THAT OF CHOOSING BETWEEN YOURSELF AND A PLAIN DUTY THAT LIES BEFORE ME THE TEMPTATION AS YOU CALL IT
DID YOU THINK I WAS LOST I WAS SEDUCED INTO JOINING YOUR MISSIONARY MEETING PEOPLE AND HAVE HAD TO STOP LATE AT THE OFFICE TO MAKE UP FOR IT
AND THERE WAS AN END OF THE CASE AT ANY RATE FOR THE PRESENT FOR NOTHING MORE SATISFACTORY COULD BE GOT OUT OF MISTER GALLOWAY I HAVE BEEN CHECKMATED EJACULATED THE ANGRY BUTTERBY
HE SAYS HE LEARNS BY THE DESPATCH THAT THE LETTER WAS NOT OPENED AFTER IT LEFT THIS OFFICE NOW IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY DESPATCH COULD TELL HIM THAT
IS BEYOND MY TELLING THE DARLING BOY IF I COULD BUT GET TO THAT LORD CHANCELLOR
NOT AT ALL ANSWERED LADY AUGUSTA I NEVER CHAPERON TWO CHILDREN TO A CROWDED MEETING PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THEY TOOK UP THE ROOM OF GROWN UP PERSONS YOU WILL LET ME GO NOT CAROLINE MISS CHANNING PLEADED FANNY WHEN HER MOTHER
SAID HAMISH WITH HIS SUNNY SMILE YOU CANNOT HELP IN IT YOU KNOW HAMISH
THE GIRL SHOOK HER HEAD I DUN KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT MISSIS IS UPSTAIRS FIXING THE MUSTARD OH COME THIS GAVE A PROMISE OF SOMETHING OLD KETCH THOUGHT MUSTARD THE GREATEST CONDIMENT THAT TRIPE COULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY IN CONJUNCTION WITH ONIONS
THINK OF ALL THAT IS AT STAKE RENEWED HEALTH EXERTION HAPPINESS ARTHUR
SOME OF THE FELLOWS HAVE BEEN SENDING KETCH AN INVITATION TO SUP AT JENKINS'S OFF TRIPE AND ONIONS AND WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE HE FOUND IT WAS A HOAX AND MISSUS JENKINS TURNED HIM OUT AGAIN THAT'S WHAT MASTER CHARLEY MUST HAVE GONE AFTER HAMISH TURNED ROUND WHERE IS CHARLEY BY THE WAY
SAY THE PRINCESS HELENA OR THE PRINCESS LOUISE TO DECLINE TO RISE EARLY FOR THEIR MORNING STUDIES WITH THEIR GOVERNESS MISS HILDYARD ON THE PLEA THAT IT WAS NOT LADY LIKE CAROLINE'S OBJECTION APPEARED TO BE MELTING AWAY UNDER HER
ROLAND LOUNGED IN NOT MORE PRESENTABLE THAN THE REST WHY HAD LADY AUGUSTA NOT BROUGHT THEM UP TO BETTER HABITS WHY SHOULD THEY COME DOWN ON A SUNDAY MORNING MORE UNTIDY THAN ON OTHER MORNINGS
HAD EXCITED INTEREST FAR AND WIDE THE BENCH WAS CROWDED AND THE COURT WAS ONE DENSE SEA OF HEADS ARTHUR APPEARED ESCORTED BY HIS BROTHER HAMISH AND BY ROLAND YORKE ROLAND WAS IN HIGH FEATHER THROWING HIS HAUGHTY GLANCES EVERYWHERE
THERE WAS NO NECESSITY TO HURRY OVER IT IN ORDER TO HASTEN TO THE VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS OF EVERY DAY LIFE IT WAS TAKEN LEISURELY AMIDST MUCH PLEASANT SOCIAL CONVERSE AS THEY WERE ASSEMBLING FOR BREAKFAST ON THIS MORNING ARTHUR CAME IN
LEAVING THE LETTER ON JENKINS'S DESK IN YOUR CHARGE AND YORKE'S YES SIR I PLACED THE LETTER IN THE RACK IN YOUR ROOM IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS AND PRAY WHAT LOOSE ACQUAINTANCES DID YOU AND YORKE RECEIVE HERE THAT AFTERNOON
NO SAID CAROLINE SHARPLY MISS CHANNING WILL FIX UPON ME I SHALL OBEY LADY AUGUSTA
GERALD AND TOD WERE IN BED I SHALL ASK HIM WHY HE DID NOT BUT MISS CHANNING THIS MUST BE A DREADFUL BLOW FOR YOU ALL IT WOULD BE FAR WORSE LADY AUGUSTA IF WE BELIEVED HIM GUILTY SHE REPLIED FROM HER ACHING HEART
FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT THEY HAD NOT THE MOST DISTANT IDEA WHAT THEIR OFFENCE COULD HAVE BEEN GAUNT ENTERED AND THE REST TROOPED IN AFTER HIM THE HEAD MASTER SAT AT HIS DESK IN STERN STATE THE OTHER MASTERS WERE IN THEIR PLACES
SINCE HE WAS SURE TO DO IT AGAIN THE VERY NEXT TIME THE TEMPTATION OFFERED ITSELF FAILING TEMPTATION HE WOULD REMAIN AT HIS POST STEADILY ENOUGH NO IT WAS NOT ROLAND'S ESCAPADE THAT MISTER GALLOWAY WAS CONSIDERING
IT WERE SURELY A BREACH OF POLITENESS ON OUR PART NOT TO ATTEND MISTER KETCH IN HIS IMPROMPTU EVENING VISIT HE SHUFFLED ALONG AT THE VERY TOP OF HIS SPEED HIS MOUTH WATERING WHILE THE DELICIOUS ODOUR OF TRIPE AND ONIONS APPEARED TO BE BORNE ON THE AIR TO HIS OLFACTORY NERVES
THERE'S SOME ROW UP AND YOU ARE NOT TO HAVE HOLIDAY CONTINUED THE SERVANT THE MASTER SAID LAST NIGHT I WAS TO CALL HIM THIS MORNING AS USUAL AT THIS UNEXPECTED REPLY THE BOYS SLUNK AWAY TO THE COLLEGE SCHOOLROOM
SHE EVEN FORGOT HERSELF SO FAR AS TO BE INSOLENT FANNY WAS TAKEN TO THE MEETING YOU SAW HER IN THE CARRIAGE WHEN LADY AUGUSTA DROVE TO MISTER GALLOWAY'S OFFICE AND PERSUADED HAMISH TO JOIN THEM CAROLINE WAS LEFT AT HOME IN A STATE OF OPEN REBELLION WITH THE LESSONS TO LEARN
AND I AM SORRY TO SAY I WAS SEDUCED INTO STOPPING OUT WITH HIM LONGER THAN I OUGHT TO HAVE DONE MISTER GALLOWAY STARED AT ROLAND AT WHAT TIME DID YOU GO OUT HE ASKED JUST AFTER YOU DID SIR THE BELL WAS GOING FOR COLLEGE
EXCLAIMED ROLAND REMEMBERING THE TIME WHEN TANNINGS HAD BEEN HIS PORTION FOR THE SAME FAULT GO AND SEE WHAT THEY ARE AFTER MARTHA THEY WERE AFTER JUMPING UP IN ALARM AROUSED BY THE COLLEGE BELL AMIDST WILD CONFUSION FOR NOTHING SEEMED TO BE AT HAND
YOU KNOW THAT I NEVER ABSENTED MYSELF
BUT AVOIDING SUCH HARD NAMES LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING MY DEAR WHICH NEVERTHELESS I HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE AND THAT IS THIS THAT I SHALL THINK I HAVE REASON TO BE HIGHLY DISPLEASED WITH YOU
SUCH STROKES OF GAYETY FANCY AND HUMOUR AS WILL ENTERTAIN AND DIVERT AND AT THE SAME TIME BOTH WARN AND INSTRUCT ALL THE LETTERS ARE WRITTEN WHILE THE HEARTS OF THE WRITERS MUST BE SUPPOSED TO BE WHOLLY ENGAGED IN THEIR SUBJECTS
THAT YOU WON'T DO YOU CANNOT BEAR THE THOUGHTS OF HAVING THEIR SOLMES AND LOVELACE IS RESOLVED YOU SHALL BE HIS
MY MOTHER BEEN SO GOOD AS TO TELL ME THIS SINCE I SENT AWAY MY LAST NEVERTHELESS I BELIEVE THEY ALL THINK THAT I RECEIVE LETTERS FROM MISTER LOVELACE
THOROUGHLY DESPISES HER BUT YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME THAT STILL SHE LOVES HIM OF ALL MEN BELL HAS A MEANNESS IN HER VERY PRIDE THAT MEANNESS RISES WITH HER PRIDE AND GOES HAND IN HAND WITH IT
CONNIVING ON THE CONTRARY
AND THE MORE SO AS NEITHER HIS LIFE NOR MORALS PERHAPS WOULD STAND A FAIR INQUIRY HE SMILED AND CALLED HIMSELF MY SERVANT THE OCCASION WAS TOO FAIR HE SAID FOR MISS HOWE WHO NEVER SPARED HIM TO LET IT PASS
THAT ALL HIS RELATIONS ARE AFRAID OF HIM
THAT THESE PRESUMERS APPEAR NOT IN THIS VERY UNWORTHY LIGHT TO SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS IS BECAUSE THEIR DEFECTS ARE NOT SO STRIKING TO THEM AS TO OTHERS AND WHY SHALL I VENTURE TO TELL YOU
NAMES OF THE PRINCIPAL PERSONS MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE A YOUNG LADY OF GREAT BEAUTY AND MERIT
MISS HOWE TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SUNDAY
TO LAY HERSELF IN THE POWER OF A SERVANT'S TONGUE POOR CREATURE BUT LIKE LITTLE SOULS WILL FIND ONE ANOTHER OUT AND MINGLE AS WELL AS LIKE GREAT ONES THIS HOWEVER
AND WE CAN SCRIBBLE UPON TWENTY INNOCENT SUBJECTS AND TAKE DELIGHT IN THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE INNOCENT THOUGH WERE THEY TO BE SEEN
AND CARRY TO HER OWN HEART DIVESTED OF SELF PARTIALITY THE CENSURE WHICH AROSE FROM HER OWN CONVICTIONS AND THAT EVEN TO THE ACQUITTAL OF THOSE BECAUSE REVERED CHARACTERS WHOM NO ONE ELSE WOULD ACQUIT
AS HE IS IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH US HIS WRITINGS ARE NOT PROBABLY SUCH AS WOULD REDOUND EITHER TO HIS OWN HONOUR OR TO THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS WERE THEY TO BE READ HE MUST BE CONSCIOUS OF THIS
HE IS ONE OF THE READIEST AND QUICKEST OF WRITERS HE MUST INDEED HAVE HAD EARLY A VERY DOCILE GENIUS SINCE A PERSON OF HIS PLEASURABLE TURN AND ACTIVE SPIRIT
YET IF I DO PUT AN END TO IT WITHOUT MAKING IT A CONDITION OF BEING FREED FROM MISTER SOLMES'S ADDRESS MAY I MY DEAR IS IT BEST TO CONTINUE IT A LITTLE LONGER IN ORDER TO EXTRICATE MYSELF OUT OF THE OTHER DIFFICULTY
WHO HAPPENED TO BE BORN THIRTY YEARS BEFORE ONE OF YOUR UNCLES I SPEAK
SO THAT THEY ARE ADVISED WITH UPON EVERY ARTICLE RELATING TO US OR THAT MAY AFFECT US IT IS THEREFORE THE LESS WONDER AT A TIME WHEN THEY UNDERSTAND THAT MISTER LOVELACE IS DETERMINED TO PAY
WHICH IS DUE TO VANITY AND SELF OPINION AND AT THE SAME TIME HALF PERSUADES THOSE WHO HEAR HIM THAT HE REALLY DESERVES THE EXULTATION HE GIVES HIMSELF BUT SUPPOSING IT TO BE TRUE THAT ALL HIS VACANT NIGHTLY HOURS ARE EMPLOYED IN WRITING
I WILL NOW RESUME MY NARRATIVE OF PROCEEDINGS HERE MY BROTHER BEING IN A GOOD WAY ALTHOUGH YOU MAY BE SURE THAT HIS RESENTMENTS ARE RATHER HEIGHTENED
I WOULD NOT HAVE MISTER SOLMES I TELL HIM THAT TO RETURN AS I UNDERSTAND HE DOES DEFIANCES FOR DEFIANCES TO MY RELATIONS IS FAR FROM BEING A PROOF WITH ME EITHER OF HIS POLITENESS
THE INTENTION IS I TELL YOU PLAINLY TO MORTIFY YOU INTO A SENSE OF YOUR DUTY THE NEIGHBOURS YOU ARE SO SOLICITOUS TO APPEAR WELL WITH ALREADY KNOW THAT YOU DEFY THAT SO MISS
SO MY DEAR BEFORE THE MALADY YOU WOT OF YET
I THOUGHT IT BEST TO RENEW MY REQUEST I DID THE FOLLOWING IS A COPY OF WHAT I WROTE AND WHAT FOLLOWS THAT OF THE ANSWER SENT ME SIR
TO APOLOGIZE TO ME FOR THAT CHANGE OF STYLE TO THEM AND TILL YOU WILL SPEAK OUT LIKE A FRIEND TO HER UNQUESTIONABLE FRIEND I MUST TEASE YOU A LITTLE LET IT RUN THEREFORE FOR IT WILL RUN IF THEN
CAN SATISFY MY LOVE AND MY FRIENDSHIP SURELY YOU ARE NOT AFRAID TO TRUST YOURSELF WITH A SECRET OF THIS NATURE IF YOU ARE THEN YOU MAY THE MORE ALLOWABLY DOUBT ME BUT I DARE SAY
AND FOR HER DRIVING ON FOR A FIXED DAY FOR SACRIFICING YOU TO SOLMES IN SHORT FOR HER RUDENESS AND VIOLENCE OF EVERY KIND WHAT A SWEET REVENGE WILL SHE TAKE AS WELL UPON LOVELACE AS UPON YOU
WRITERS WHOSE SUBJECTS AND CHARACTERS HAVE LESS WARRANTED THE LIBERTIES THEY HAVE TAKEN IN THE LETTERS OF THE TWO YOUNG LADIES IT IS PRESUMED
IN SHORT INTO A MERE LOVERLIKE CORRESPONDENCE WHICH MY HEART CONDEMNS IT IS EASY TO SEE IF I DO NOT BREAK IT OFF THAT MISTER LOVELACE'S ADVANTAGES BY REASON OF MY UNHAPPY SITUATION
TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE MY BROTHER
THAT IN THE GREAT CORRESPONDENCE BY LETTERS WHICH HE HOLDS HE IS AS SECRET AND AS CAREFUL AS IF IT WERE OF A TREASONABLE NATURE YET TROUBLES NOT HIS HEAD WITH POLITICS THOUGH NOBODY KNOWS THE INTERESTS OF PRINCES AND COURTS BETTER THAN HE IS SAID TO DO
THE MAN TOO SO LITTLE TO BE APPROVED OF FOR HIS MORALS IF
THERE IS NO HURT I PRESUME IN LETTING MY SISTER KNOW THE CONDITION SHE GOES TO MISS HOWE UPON SINCE IF HE GETS A NACK OF VISITING HER THERE YOU MAY BE SURE INTERRUPTED MY UNCLE HARLOWE
THAT YOU WILL NEVER BE BROUGHT TO THINK OF SUCH A MAN AS SOLMES
I BEG YOUR PARDON MY DEAREST FRIEND FOR HAVING GIVEN YOU OCCASION TO REMIND ME OF THE DATE OF MY LAST I WAS WILLING TO HAVE BEFORE ME AS MUCH OF THE WORKINGS OF YOUR WISE RELATIONS AS POSSIBLE
BUT BE IT YOUR PART IF I DO TO SOOTH MY ANGRY PASSIONS AND TO SOFTEN MY RESENTMENTS AND THIS THE RATHER AS YOU KNOW WHAT AN INFLUENCE YOUR ADVICE HAS UPON ME AND AS YOU MUST ALSO KNOW
HOW CRUEL MY DEAR IN YOU TO ROB THE POOR BELLA OF THE ONLY LOVER SHE ONLY HAD
AND TAKE IT AMISS AS THEY HAVE REASON TO BE INCLUDED BY OURS IN THE CONTEMPT THROWN UPON THEIR KINSMAN CURIOSITY AT PRESENT IS ALL MY MOTIVE
OF IT IN PRAISE OF THE POOR FELLOW'S HONESTY WERE THIS SO AND WERE NOT THAT LANDLORD RELATED TO MY DEAREST FRIEND HOW SHOULD I DESPISE SUCH A WRETCH BUT PERHAPS THE STORY IS AGGRAVATED
AND WOULD NOT LOVE AND PITY EXCUSABLY NAY LAUDABLY MAKE A GOOD WIFE
HAVE EVERY ONE'S ILL WORD AND SO INDEED THEY OUGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE ONLY SOLICITOUS TO KEEP THAT WHICH THEY PREFER TO EVERY ONE'S GOOD ONE COVETOUS INDEED WOULD THEY BE WHO DESERVED NEITHER YET EXPECTED BOTH
TO REFLECT UPON YOUR SISTER SHE IS A WORTHY CHILD SIR I HAVE DONE REPLIED HE AND YET I HAVE HER HONOUR AT HEART AS MUCH AS THE HONOUR OF THE REST OF THE FAMILY
AND NO ONE IS SO PROUD AS BELL SHE HAS OWNED HER LOVE HER UNEASY DAYS AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AND HER REVENGE GRAFTED UPON HER LOVE TO HER FAVOURITE BETTY BARNES
HE IS FULL OF THE FAVOURS OF THE LADIES OF HIS FAMILY TO ME TO WHOM NEVERTHELESS I AM PERSONALLY A STRANGER EXCEPT THAT I ONCE SAW MISS PATTY MONTAGUE AT MISSUS KNOLLY'S
SO MY DEAR I AM TO BE DELIVERED UP TO MY BROTHER I WAS RESOLVED HOWEVER TO ASK OF HIM THIS FAVOUR ACCORDINGLY
BUT WHAT SHALL WE SAY OF THAT LANDLORD WHO THOUGH HE KNEW THE POOR MAN TO BE QUITE DESTITUTE COULD TAKE IT AND SAYING NOTHING WHILE MISTER LOVELACE STAID AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE TELL
THAT THEY DO NOT PUT IT TO ME
SAID JAMIE THAT'S ONLY BUT ERE HE GOT FARTHER THE MOONLIGHT IN THE LOFT WAS DARKENED I LOOKED HURRIEDLY TOWARDS THE DOOR THERE STOOD THE STRANGEST FIGURE
I WAS IN DARKNESS BUT NOT IN MY OWN BED WHEN I PROCEEDED TO TURN I FOUND MYSELF HEMMED IN ON ALL SIDES I COULD NOT STRETCH MY ARMS AND THERE WAS HARDLY ROOM FOR MY BODY BETWEEN MY FEET AND MY HEAD
HE WAS FAR TOO SOUND ASLEEP TO BE TROUBLED BY THE RATS FOR SLEEP IS AN ARMOUR YES A CASTLE AGAINST MANY ENEMIES I GOT HOLD OF ONE OF HIS HANDS
WHICH I COULD DRAW BACK THE OPEN DOOR REVEALED THE DARK NIGHT BEFORE ME WAS THE CORNYARD AS WE CALLED IT FULL OF RICKS HUGE AND VERY POSITIVE ALTHOUGH DIM THEY ROSE BETWIXT ME AND THE SKY
WHO SEEMED TO BE HER HUSBAND HE LOOKED MERRILY AT HER AND SHE LOOKED TRUSTFULLY AT HIM AND I KNEW THAT THEY GOT ON VERY WELL TOGETHER THE STARS WERE THEIR CHILDREN OF COURSE AND THEY SEEMED TO RUN ABOUT THE CEILING JUST AS THEY PLEASED
WOULD TURN AGAIN TO HIS BOOK OR HIS SERMON SAYING VERY WELL MISSUS MITCHELL
SUDDENLY DROPPING INTO A CANTER AND THEN STANDING STOCK STILL IT WAS A COTTAGE HALF IN RUINS OCCUPIED BY AN OLD WOMAN WHOM I DIMLY RECOLLECTED HAVING ONCE GONE WITH MY FATHER TO SEE A GOOD MANY YEARS AGO
AND HE THOUGHT TO HOLD HER FAST SHE DROPPED AT HIS FEET WITHOUT MOTION OR HEED HE TOOK HER AND HOME HE SPED ALL DAY SHE LAY LIKE A WITHERED SEAWEED ON A PURPLE AND GOWDEN BED
AND MUST PUNISH THEM TO MAKE THEM GOOD WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM NOW IN THE SILENT STARRY NIGHT A YET GREATER TERROR SEIZED ME AND I RAN STUMBLING OVER THE UNEVEN FIELD DOES MY READER
TO RUIN HER A POOR LONE WOMAN WITH NO FRIENDS TO TAKE HER PART I DO NOT THINK IT LIKELY THEY COULD BE SO WICKED SAID MY FATHER SO I'M TO BE THE ONLY WICKED PERSON IN THE WORLD VERY WELL SIR
BUT YOU MUST BEG MISSUS MITCHELL'S PARDON FIRST AND AFTER THAT THERE WILL BE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY I FEAR BUT FATHER YOU HAVE NOT HEARD MY STORY YET WELL GO ON IT IS FAIR I SUPPOSE TO HEAR BOTH SIDES
WHEN I HAD MADE A HOLE LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD ME I GOT IN BUT KEPT DRAWING OUT THE STRAW BEHIND ME AND FILLING THE HOLE IN FRONT THIS I CONTINUED UNTIL I HAD NOT ONLY STOPPED UP THE ENTRANCE BUT PLACED A GOOD THICKNESS OF STRAW BETWEEN ME AND THE OUTSIDE
WAS COMPLIMENTARY TO NONE BUT THE TWO WOMEN THEMSELVES MEANTIME I WAS MAKING WHAT OBSERVATIONS MY TERROR WOULD ALLOW ABOUT A DOZEN CHILDREN WERE SEATED ON FORMS ALONG THE WALLS LOOKING OVER THE TOPS OF THEIR SPELLING BOOKS AT THE NEWCOMER
THE AWFUL VAULT OF HEAVEN OVER MY HEAD AND THOSE SHADOWY RICKS AROUND ME IT WAS A RELIEF TO LAY MY HAND ON ONE OF THEM AND FEEL THAT IT WAS SOLID I HALF GROPED MY WAY THROUGH THEM
BUT DID NOT SEE HER HOW BLANK AND DULL THE SCHOOLROOM SEEMED STILL SHE MIGHT ARRIVE ANY MOMENT BUT SHE DID NOT COME I WENT THROUGH MY DUTIES WEARILY HOPING EVER FOR THE HOUR OF RELEASE
AND THEREFORE ANY MODE OF LITERATURE WAS PRECIOUS THE SCHOOLMASTER WAS THE CHIEF SOURCE FROM WHICH I DERIVED MY PROVISION OF THIS SORT
IN THE LOW ENDEAVOUR TO BOLSTER UP THE WRONG WITH MY SILLY LOGIC NO THEREFORE IF I WERE TO DO WHAT WAS RUDE AND DISHONEST PEOPLE WOULD SAY WHAT COULD YOU EXPECT OF A PLOUGHBOY A PRINCE OUGHT TO BE JUST SO MUCH BETTER BRED THAN A PLOUGHBOY
SHE WOULD RISE AND WANDER TILL BREAKIN MORN HARK HARKIN THE SOUND O THE DEEP ONE NIGHT WHEN THE WIND WAS WAILING ABOUT AND THE SEA WAS SPECKLED WI FOAM FROM ROOM TO ROOM SHE WENT IN AND OUT
AND OTHERS WHO TAKE THINGS BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE TELL THEM SO ARE ALWAYS WALKING IN THE STRANGE MOONLIGHT
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
O JEANNIE ARE YE TELL ME WIFE OR WIDOW OR BAITH
AND WHY ASKED MY FATHER SHE MADE NO ANSWER I MUST GET AT THE TRUTH OF IT SAID MY FATHER YOU CAN GO NOW SHE LEFT THE ROOM WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND MY FATHER TURNED TO TURKEY
EVERYTHING MY FATHER HEARD CONFIRMED THE TALE WE HAD TOLD HIM BUT THE KELPIE FRUSTRATED WHATEVER HE MAY HAVE RESOLVED UPON WITH REGARD TO HER BEFORE HE RETURNED SHE HAD DISAPPEARED
AND PEEPING ROUND SAW THAT MY FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CORRECT IT WAS THE KELPIE SHE ENTERED AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER VERY SOFTLY AFRAID OF BEING LOCKED OUT A DANGER WHICH HAD SCARCELY OCCURRED TO ME BEFORE
AND DOWN THEIR EYELIDS WINKED AND WINKED AND THEIR CHEEKS PUCKERED AND RELAXED INCESSANTLY THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE STORM OF EXPRESSION UPON THEIR FACES THEIR VERY NOSES TWISTED AND CURLED
WHEN I HAD FINISHED AND KIRSTY HAD LEFT THE KITCHEN FOR A MOMENT I SPED NOISELESSLY TO THE DOOR AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE FARMYARD THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN DARK AND BROWN AND COOL THE DOOR OF THE BARN STOOD OPEN AS IF INVITING ME TO SHELTER AND SAFETY
AND THAT I WAS GOING TO LEAVE BEHIND IT WAS VERY BITTER ESPECIALLY AS I HAD EXPECTED TO GO WITH MY ELDER BROTHER TO SPEND THE DAY AT A NEIGHBOURING FARM MISSUS MITCHELL OPENED THE DOOR AND LED ME IN IT WAS AN AWFUL EXPERIENCE DAME SHAND STOOD AT HER TABLE IRONING
WHO WAS HOBBLING AFTER ME BUT WITH THE RENEWED STRENGTH OF TRIUMPH I TURNED AGAIN FOR HOME AND RAN AS I HAD NEVER RUN BEFORE WHEN OR WHERE THE DAME GAVE IN I DO NOT KNOW
AS WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS HOUSE I FELT A LITTLE CONFUSED FOR I NOW SAW CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT MY FATHER COULD NOT APPROVE OF OUR PROCEEDINGS I WHISPERED TO ALLISTER RUN AND FETCH TURKEY TELL HIM TO COME DIRECTLY
SEVERAL TIMES SHE BROKE OUT ACCUSING ME OF TELLING A PACK OF WICKED LIES BUT MY FATHER TOLD HER SHE SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF DEFENDING HERSELF AND SHE MUST NOT INTERRUPT ME WHEN I HAD DONE HE CALLED TURKEY
THAT'S ALL VERY FINE BUT I KNOW SOMETHING A GOOD DEAL FINER NOW WASH YOUR FACE I WON'T SO LONG AS YOU STAND THERE I SAID AND SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS ME IF YOU TOUCH ME I'LL SCREAM
SO STEEP THAT I HAD TROUBLE IN RETAINING MY SEAT I BEGAN NOT AT ALL TO MY COMFORT TO SURMISE IN WHAT DIRECTION THE MARE WAS CARRYING ME WE WERE APPROACHING THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD SAT THAT SAME AFTERNOON
CAME RUNNING IN GREAT DISTRESS TO KIRSTY CRYING FEE FEE BY WHICH HE MEANT TO INDICATE THAT A FLEA WAS RENDERING HIS LIFE MISERABLE
OF COURSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND A BETTER SERMON THAN ANY OTHER CLERGYMAN WHATEVER COULD HAVE PREACHED BUT WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ME I MAY AS WELL CONFESS AT ONCE THAT I NEVER HAD THE LEAST DOUBT THAT MY FATHER WAS THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD
WHEN I SEE MY MOTHER AGAIN SHE WILL NOT REPROACH ME THAT MY TEARS WERE SO SOON DRIED LITTLE ONE I THINK I HEAR HER SAYING
WE CANNOT DENY THAT HE MADE MISSUS MITCHELL TOO IT IS VERY PUZZLING I CONFESS I REMEMBER ONCE THAT MY YOUNGEST BROTHER DAVIE A VERY LITTLE FELLOW THEN FOR HE COULD NOT SPEAK PLAINLY
AN A GLIMMER O CAULD WEET LICHT CAM OWER THE WATER STRAUCHT FRAE THE MUNE
WHICH ON ANOTHER SIDE BOUNDED THE CORN YARD THERE WAS THE MOON CRESCENT AS I SAW HER IN MY DREAM BUT LOW DOWN TOWARDS THE HORIZON AND LYING ALMOST UPON HER ROUNDED BACK SHE LOOKED VERY DISCONSOLATE AND DIM
I DID NOT CRY I WAS TOO YOUNG AND IGNORANT TO CRY ABOUT IT I WENT TO SLEEP AGAIN AND SEEMED TO WAKE ONCE MORE BUT IT WAS INTO MY DREAM THIS TIME THERE WERE THE SUN AND THE MOON AND THE STARS BUT THE SUN AND THE MOON HAD GOT CLOSE TOGETHER
AND COLOURED A LITTLE WITH THE MOON'S YELLOWNESS IF I WERE WRITING FOR GROWN PEOPLE I SHOULD TELL THEM THAT THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND THINGS BECAUSE THEY THINK ABOUT THEM AND ASK GOD TO TEACH THEM WALK IN THE SUNLIGHT
IT HAD BEEN BUILT BY DUFF HIMSELF TO RECEIVE HIS BRIDE AND ALTHOUGH SINCE ENLARGED WAS STILL A VERY LITTLE HOUSE
SHE LITTLE KNEW WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN MY FATHER AND ME ALREADY
AH YOU MAY LOOK SAID THE DAME IF YOU'RE NOT A GOOD BOY THAT IS HOW YOU SHALL BE SERVED THE DOG SHALL HAVE YOU TO LOOK AFTER I TREMBLED AND WAS SPEECHLESS AFTER SOME FURTHER CONFABULATION MISSUS MITCHELL TOOK HER LEAVE SAYING
WITH WHOM WE WERE SURE OF A KIND RECEPTION SHE WAS A PATIENT DILIGENT WOMAN
AND THE PLOT HAD SUCCEEDED DESPITE ITS PARTIAL FAILURE DESPITE THE SWIFT REVERSE CHANCE AND LANYARD'S CUNNING HAD METED OUT TO THE PACK'S AGENT IT WAS HIS DRESSING GOWN THAT WAS SATURATE WITH RODDY'S BLOOD JUST AS THEY WERE HIS GLOVES PILFERED FROM HIS LUGGAGE
HE OPENED IT AND HESITATED A MOMENT LOOKING OUT AS THOUGH QUESTIONING THE WEATHER SIMULTANEOUSLY HIS DEFT FINGERS WEDGED THE LATCH BACK WITH A THIN SLIP OF STEEL NO RAIN IN FACT HAD FALLEN WITHIN THE HOUR
A BLOW OF THE PAW IS WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE A BLOW OF THE PAW SOMETHING TO NUMB THE WITS OF THE WILIEST MOUSE CONSIDERING RODDY HE BELIEVED IT TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GAUGE THE LIMITATIONS OF THAT ESSENTIALLY BRITISH INTELLIGENCE
SELDOM INTERRUPTING WHAT WAS PRACTICALLY A DUOLOGUE BETWEEN HER PUTATIVE FATHER AND THE THIRD OF THEIR PARTY THIS LAST WAS ONE WHOM LANYARD WAS SURE HE KNEW THOUGH HE COULD SEE NO MORE THAN THE BACK OF MONSIEUR LE COMTE REMY DE MORBIHAN
THAT IS CLEAR I TRUST TOO DEEP FOR ME MY FRIEND THE ELDERLY MAN CONFESSED IMPENETRABLE RETICENCE THE COUNT EXPOUNDED SENTENTIOUS AND ENJOYING HIMSELF HUGELY ISN'T POSSIBLE IN THE HUMAN RELATIONS
HE WORKED RAPIDLY AT A HIGH PITCH OF EXCITEMENT AS MUCH THROUGH SHEER DESPERATION AS THROUGH ANY APPEAL INHERENT IN THE SCHEME EITHER TO HIS COMMON SENSE OR TO HIS ROMANTIC BENT IN TWO MINUTES HE HAD STRIPPED THE MOUSTACHE CLEAN AWAY FROM THAT STUPID FLACCID MASK
HE WAS A SQUARE SET MAN WITH A SQUARE JAW COLD BLUE EYES A FAT NOSE A THIN LIPPED TRAP OF A MOUTH
SO IT APPEARED THAT THIS AGENT OF THE PACK HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED TO PUT THE LONE WOLF TO SLEEP FOR AN HOUR OR TWO OR MORE PERHAPS NOT PERMANENTLY THAT HE MIGHT BE OUT OF THE WAY LONG ENOUGH FOR THEIR OCCULT PURPOSES
IN CO OPERATION WITH RODDY'S MURDERER
COULD DISTINCTLY HEAR A TUNELESS VOICE CONTENTEDLY HUMMING SALLY IN OUR ALLEY A RENDITION PUNCTUATED BY ONE HEAVY THUMP AND THEN ANOTHER AND THEN BY A HEARTFELT SIGH OF RELIEF AS RODDY KICKED OFF HIS BOOTS AND FOLLOWED BY THE TAPPING OF A PIPE AGAINST GRATE BARS
SUDDENLY CONSCIOUS OF A DRY AND BURNING THROAT HE ROSE AND GOING TO THE WASHSTAND DRANK DEEP AND THIRSTILY FROM A WATER BOTTLE
THE GIRL BENT FORWARD WITH A LOOK OF EAGER INTEREST THE LONE WOLF WHO IS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HIM IN AMERICA MADEMOISELLE NO
ALL ARE GONE THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES LANYARD QUOTED IN VINDICTIVE MELANCHOLY DAMN EM HAPPILY
SOMETHING AS SELF CONTAINED AS A LONDON FLAT ONE THING ONLY WAS CERTAIN RODDY DIDN'T ALWAYS THINK IN TERMS OF BEEF AND BASS HE WAS NOBODY'S FACILE FOOL HE COULD MAKE A SHREWD INFERENCE AS WELL AS STRIKE A SHREWD BLOW REVIEWING THE SCENE IN THE RESTAURANT
KNELT AND LIFTING THE BODY TURNED IT UPON ITS BACK
LANYARD GENTLY PINCHED THE SMALL END OF A CIGAR DIPPED IT INTO HIS COFFEE AND LIGHTED IT WITH NOT SO MUCH AS A SUSPICION OF TREMOR HIS BRAIN HOWEVER
I'M SORRY LANYARD EXCUSED HIMSELF BUT AS YOU SEE I AM ONLY JUST IN FROM THE RAILROAD A LONG AND TIRESOME JOURNEY YOU ARE VERY GOOD BUT I GOOD DE MORBIHAN EXCLAIMED WITH VIOLENCE I ON THE CONTRARY I AM A VERY SELFISH MAN
AND HE WONDERED WITH A THRILL OF AMUSEMENT IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THAT RODDY WAS ON THE TRAIL OF THAT TREMENDOUS BUCK IF SO IT WOULD BE A CHASE WORTH FOLLOWING A DIVERSION RENDERED THE MORE EXQUISITE TO LANYARD BY THE SPICE OF NOVELTY SINCE FOR ONCE HE WOULD FIGURE AS A DISPASSIONATE BYSTANDER
SEVERAL SECONDS PASSED WITHOUT THE LEAST SOUND DISTURBING THE STILLNESS LANYARD HIMSELF GREW A LITTLE IMPATIENT FINDING THAT HIS SIGHT FAILED TO GROW ACCUSTOMED TO THE DARKNESS BECAUSE THAT LAST WAS TOO ABSOLUTE
STEPPING OUT HE SLAMMED THE DOOR AND STRODE BRISKLY ROUND THE CORNER AS IF MAKING FOR THE CAB RANK THAT LINES UP ALONG THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS SIDE OF THE RUE DE MEDICIS HIS BOOT HEELS MADE A CHEERFUL RACKET IN THAT QUIET HOUR HE WAS QUITE AUDIBLY GOING AWAY FROM TROYON'S
WHILE NOT A FEW MEN PERHAPS FOR THAT REASON DID THEIR POSSESSOR THE HONOUR TO IMITATE THEM
IT WAS THE NEEDLE OF THIS INSTRUMENT THAT HAD PRICKED THE SKIN OF LANYARD'S NECK BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT IT CONTAINED A SOPORIFIC IF NOT EXACTLY A KILLING DOSE OF SOME NARCOTIC DRUG COCAINE AT A VENTURE
AND LANYARD SMILED OVER THE THOUGHT THAT THE MAN FROM SCOTLAND YARD MIGHT PROFITABLY HAVE COPIED THAT TRICK OF POOR BOURKE'S OF SNORING LIKE THE SEVEN SLEEPERS WHEN MOST COMPLETELY AWAKE
RODDY PROVING A MENACE TO THE PACK AND REQUIRING ELIMINATION HIS MURDER HAD BEEN DECREED AS WELL AS THAT THE BLAME FOR IT SHOULD BE LAID AT LANYARD'S DOOR
BUT HIS DECISION WAS FRIGHTFULLY HAMPERED BY LACK OF READY MONEY THE FEW ODD FRANCS IN HIS POCKET WERE NO STORE FOR THE WAR CHEST DEMANDED BY THIS EMERGENCY TRUE HE HAD THE OMBER JEWELS BUT THEY WERE NOT NEGOTIABLE NOT AT LEAST IN PARIS AND THE HUYSMAN PLANS
BLACK MUST TURN UP EVERY SO OFTEN IN A RUN OF RED EVERY GAMBLER KNOWS AS MUCH AND WHAT WAS MICHAEL LANYARD BUT A COMMON GAMBLER
JUST AT PRESENT REASONING FROM NOISES AUDIBLE THROUGH THE BOLTED DOOR THAT COMMUNICATED WITH THE ADJOINING BED CHAMBER THE BUSINESS OF A SLEUTH SEEMED TO COMPRISE GOING TO BED LANYARD SHAVING AND DRESSING
BAGGY CORDUROY TROUSERS FLAPPING ROUND ITS BONY SHANKS THIS WAS POPINOT'S AND BUT ONE OF A THOUSAND DIFFERING IN NO ESSENTIAL SAVE DEGREE OF VICIOUSNESS
BUT ONLY TO HAVE HIS CLEARING SENSES MET AND DASHED BY THE MUZZLE OF A PISTOL STAMPING A COLD RING UPON HIS TEMPLE LIE PERFECTLY QUIET MY DEAR MISTER SMITH LANYARD ADVISED DON'T SPEAK ABOVE A WHISPER GIVE THE GOOD DOPE A CHANCE
WHO NEVER IN ALL HIS CRIMINAL RECORD HAD SO MUCH AS PULLED TRIGGER IN SELF DEFENCE
AND WHEN IN A SWIFT FLASH OF INTUITION HE EXAMINED HIS FINGERS HE DISCOVERED THEM DISCOLOURED WITH A FAINT REDDISH STAIN HAD THE DYE RUN AND HOW HAD THE AMERICAN COME TO DABBLE THE GARMENT IN WATER TO WHAT END THEN
THE GATHERING BEGAN TO THIN OUT UNTIL AT LENGTH THERE REMAINED ONLY THIS PARTY OF THREE LANYARD ENJOYING A MOST DELECTABLE SALAD AND RODDY PUFFING A CIGAR
LANYARD TOLD HIMSELF HE WOULD SOONER PAY THE GUILLOTINE THE PENALTY CONSULTING HIS WATCH HE FOUND THE HOUR TO BE NO LATER THAN HALF PAST FOUR SO SWIFTLY
THE MOUSE HAS EVERY RIGHT IF HE LIKES TO DESPISE THE CAT FOR A HEAVY HANDED AND BLOODTHIRSTY BEAST LACKING WIT AND IMAGINATION A CREATURE OF SIMPLE FORCE MAJEURE BUT THAT MOUSE WILL NOT ADVISEDLY SWAGGER IN CAT HAUNTED TERRITORY
THANKS TO THE ARRANGEMENT OF MIRRORS LINING THE WALLS HE COMMANDED AN INDIRECT VIEW OF LANYARD A FACT OF WHICH THE LATTER WAS NOT UNAWARE THOUGH HIS EXPRESSION REMAINED UNCHANGED AS HE SAT WITH A CORNER OF HIS EYE RESERVED FOR RODDY
BUT ALSO TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NO RODDY WERE DISPOSED TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM
TURN ABOUT HE REFLECTED IS SAID TO BE FAIR PLAY WELL WHY NOT HE BENT FORWARD
HIS EXTRAORDINARY POPULARITY WAS DUE TO THE EQUALLY EXTRAORDINARY EXTRAVAGANCE WITH WHICH HE SUPPORTED THAT LATEST GALLIC FAD LE SPORT THE PARISIAN RUGBY TEAM WAS HIS PAMPERED PROTEGE HE WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE TENNIS CLUB MAINTAINED NOT ONLY A FLOCK OF AUTOMOBILES BUT A FAMOUS RACING STABLE
AND A SECRET BETWEEN TWO IS A PROLIFIC BREEDER OF PLATITUDES GRANTED THIS LINE OF REASONING THE LONE WOLF IS OF NECESSITY NOT ONLY UNMARRIED BUT PRACTICALLY FRIENDLESS OTHER ATTRIBUTES OF HIS WILL OBVIOUSLY COMPRISE YOUTH COURAGE IMAGINATION
THEY SAY HE'S ON THE PROWL ONCE MORE THE AMERICAN LAUGHED A TRACE CONTEMPTUOUSLY LANYARD'S FINGERS TIGHTENED ON HIS KNIFE AND FORK OTHERWISE HE MADE NO SIGN A SIDELONG GLANCE INTO A MIRROR AT HIS ELBOW SHOWED RODDY STILL ABSORBED IN THE DAILY MAIL
IN LESS THAN TWENTY MINUTES HE HAD EXCHANGED CLOTHING WITH THE AMERICAN IN DETAIL EVEN DOWN TO SHIRTS COLLARS AND NECKTIES HAD PACKED IN HIS OWN POCKETS THE SEVERAL ARTICLES TAKEN FROM THE OTHER TOGETHER WITH THE JOINTED JIMMY AND A FEW OF HIS PERSONAL EFFECTS
AT LEAST HE FOUND THIS NEWS ABOUT HER MOST SURPRISING
THE SILENCE WAS ABRUPTLY BROKEN BY A STRANGE AND MOVING SOUND A HUSHED CRY OF ALARM THAT WAS HALF A MOAN AND HALF A SOB LANYARD HIMSELF WAS STARTLED FOR THAT WAS NEVER RODDY'S VOICE
IT WAS JUST POSSIBLE THAT DE MORBIHAN'S IDENTIFICATION OF LANYARD WITH THAT MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGE AT LEAST BY INNUENDO HAD BEEN UNINTENTIONAL BUT SOMEHOW LANYARD DIDN'T BELIEVE IT HAD THE TWO QUESTIONS TROUBLED HIM SORELY
MADAME NO LONGER OCCUPIED THE DESK OF THE CAISSE ENQUIRIES SO DISCREETLY WORDED AS TO BE UNCOMPROMISING ELICITED FROM THE MAITRE D'HOTEL THE INFORMATION THAT THE HOUSE HAD BEEN UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT THESE EIGHTEEN MONTHS THE OLD PROPRIETOR WAS DEAD
HELLO REGGIE SHE ANSWERED SWEETLY WHAT A TIME YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING US UP HE WAS TAKEN ABACK WELL I LIKE THAT HE GASPED AND HOW ARE YOU MISTER BUNDERCOMBE
WENT OFF THIS MORNING HE CONTINUED TWO TAXI CABS FULL OF LUGGAGE AREN'T THEY COMING BACK NO SIGNS OF IT DID THEY LEAVE ANY ADDRESS NONE ARE YOU SURE I PERSISTED
AND CONTINUED ON MY MENDACIOUS CAREER I HAVE BEEN CLOSETED WITH THE MANAGER I EXPLAINED IT WAS ONE OF THE UNDERWAITERS THE LITTLE DARK ONE WHO BROUGHT IN THE COFFEE
I HAVE HEARD THAT AMERICANS ARE RATHER SHY ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING ENGLISHMEN OH BOTHER ENGLISHMEN SHE EXCLAIMED STAMPING HER FOOT I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD I'VE EVER HEARD ABOUT THEM I SUPPOSE NOW I SHALL HAVE TO MARRY YOU I DON'T SEE ANY WAY OUT OF IT I AGREED READILY
IT IS YOUR CLEAR SIGHTED WAY OF PUTTING THINGS SHE EXPLAINED SOFTLY YOU SEEM TO UNDERSTAND PEOPLE SO THOROUGHLY I DON'T GENERALLY MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THE NUMBER OF BEANS IN THE GAME MISTER MOSS OBSERVED IN A SELF CONGRATULATORY TONE
FOR SHE SAT VERY DEMURE HER EYES FIXED ON THE ROAD AHEAD EVE I ASKED HOW ABOUT MISSUS SAMUELSON'S JEWELS THEY WERE RETURNED TO HER FROM A REPENTANT CRIMINAL EVE MURMURED
BY THE BY I ADDED PUTTING MY HEAD OUT OF THE WINDOW I THINK IT'S GETTING A LITTLE CHILLY I ORDERED THE TAXI CLOSED AND WE RETURNED TO THE HOTEL THE HALL PORTER DREW ME ON ONE SIDE CONFIDENTIALLY
EVEN EVE GAVE A LITTLE SHRIEK UPON THE THRESHOLD STOOD MISTER CULLEN AND BY HIS SIDE A LADY WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE BETWEEN FIFTY AND SIXTY YEARS OLD
I THINK YOU WILL DO WELL TO LISTEN TO YOUR WIFE AND TO TAKE HER ADVICE THERE ARE ONE OR TWO OF THESE LITTLE AFFAIRS YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT ARE NOT ENTIRELY CLOSED YET MISTER BUNDERCOMBE SIGHED HE ADOPTED AN ATTITUDE OF RESIGNATION
I BEGGED EARNESTLY I'LL GO OUT AND MAKE INQUIRIES SIR BLAYDON TAKE MY PLACE IN THAT RUBBER OF BRIDGE THERE'S A GOOD FELLOW I'LL HAVE THE RESTAURANT SEARCHED TOO DON'T MIND IF I AM AWAY A FEW MINUTES I HURRIED OUT
THEN SHE COUGHED THE SHORT DRY COUGH OF THE PROFESSIONAL SPEAKER AND CONTINUED WOULDN'T YOU BELIEVE THAT WAS SUCCESS ENOUGH FOR ANY REASONABLE MORTAL WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT WITH A WIFE HOLDING AN HONORED AND GREAT POSITION IN THE STATE
MISTER PARKER WHOSE FIRST EXPRESSION HAD BEEN ONE OF UNFEIGNED DELIGHT SUDDENLY PAUSED MY BOY HE EXPOSTULATED I DON'T WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU
BUT DO YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THE PROPOSITION I CAN'T QUITE COTTON TO SEEMS TO ME YOU'VE SOME LITTLE SCHEME OF YOUR OWN AT THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD YOU HAVEN'T GOT IT IN YOUR MIND HAVE YOU THAT YOU'RE SORT OF PUTTING US ON OUR HONOR
WHERE ARE YOU HIDING THAT'S ALL RIGHT I REPLIED I SHAN'T GIVE IT AWAY WHERE SHALL I FIND YOU WELL SHE SAID WE TALKED IT OVER AND DECIDED THAT THE BEST HIDING PLACE WAS ONE OF THE LARGER HOTELS
DID I REGGIE ENCOURAGED ME HE PROTESTED I THINK ON THE WHOLE YOU SAID THE RUDEST THINGS TO ME I EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE FROM A GIRL ANYWAY
HAD I ACTED PROPERLY IN NOT CHARGING THE WAITER
WHICH HAD ENGAGED THE ATTENTION OF THE WHOLE OF THE STAFF OF FOUR SERVANTS AND THAT FOR AN HOUR OR SO
MISTER BUNDERCOMBE AND HIS DAUGHTER WHO WERE SO AMAZINGLY KIND TO REGGIE WHEN HE WAS OUT IN THE STATES ON HIS WAY TO DICKY'S RANCH I WAS FOR A MOMENT ABSOLUTELY THUNDERSTRUCK
DO YOU KNOW THAT THREE THOUSAND WOMEN HAD TO LISTEN TO A SUBSTITUTE LAST THURSDAY AND AFTER I'D SPENT TWO MONTHS GETTING MY FACTS FOR THEM DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF OKATA
ONE OF THE NEATEST PIECES OF BUSINESS I EVER DID IN MY LIFE I BROUGHT OFF THERE IN THE OLD BAR TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH I'M GETTING A BIT PECKISH THERE IS NO REASON MISTER PARKER AGREED WHY WE SHOULD NOT DINE AT ONCE
HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME AND PERMITTED ME TO SHOW HIM OUT
NOW IF I COULD INSTITUTE A REAL BIG AFFAIR IN THE SHAPE OF A BUCKETSHOP SWINDLE IN WHICH YOUR FATHER AND I COULD PLAY THE PRINCIPAL PARTS AND YOU BECOME MERELY A SUBORDINATE
HE IS ONE FOR THE GAB AIN'T HE HE REMARKED CONFIDENTIALLY TO ME FOR THE LIFE OF ME AT THAT MOMENT I COULD NOT TELL WHETHER TO LEAVE THE ROOM IN A FIT OF ANGRY DISGUST OR TO ACCEPT THE LUDICROUS SIDE OF THE SITUATION AND LAUGH
I READ IT OUT AND PASSED IT TO REGGIE HIS FACE FELL
AND CERTAIN TO BE LORD MAYOR BEFORE LONG HIS WIFE WAS WEARING JEWELRY HERSELF LAST NIGHT WORTH I SHOULD SAY FROM TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS SO MY WIFE'S LITTLE BIT WOULDN'T DO THEM MUCH GOOD EH IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT I ADMITTED
WELL CULLEN HE REPLIED IF MY CAREER OF CRIME IS REALLY TO COME TO AN END I DON'T WANT TO BEAR YOU ANY ILL WILL WE'LL JUST TAKE A STROLL DOWNSTAIRS AND TALK ABOUT IT MISSUS BUNDERCOMBE WITH A QUICK MOVEMENT TO THE LEFT BLOCKED THE WAY
THAT IT WAITED FOR THEM AND THAT THIS DETECTIVE FROM SCOTLAND YARD MISTER CULLEN I THINK HIS NAME IS HAS FAIRLY GOT HIS KNIFE INTO THEM AND NOW I REMARKED SMILING YOU ARE PERHAPS COMING TO THE OBJECT OF YOUR VISIT TO ME
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE CODE OF MORALS YOU KNOW I FLATTER MYSELF THAT AT THIS POINT I WAS TACTFUL MY DEAR EVE I REMINDED HER YOU FORGET THAT I HAVE JOINED THE GANG I MEAN
AND I REALLY MUST TELL YOU THIS I HAD MEANT TO KEEP IT A SECRET BUT FROM YOU I CANNOT I KNEW ALL THE TIME THAT THE NAME OF BUNDERCOMBE WAS FAMILIAR TO ME AND SUDDENLY IT CAME OVER ME LIKE A FLASH
AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT UNTIL I COULD RING UP THIRTY SEVEN SEVENTY ONE A GERRARD ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK HOWEVER MY OWN TELEPHONE BELL RANG AND I WAS INFORMED THAT A GENTLEMAN WHO DESIRED TO SEE ME WAS WAITING BELOW
CONCILIATORY SO I'VE GOT YOU AT LAST HAVE I SAY THIS IS A PRETTY CHASE YOU'VE LED ME DO YOU KNOW I'VE HAD TO DESERT MY POST AS PRESIDENT OF THE GREAT AMALGAMATED MEETING OF THE FREE WOMEN OF THE WEST TO COME AND LOOK AFTER YOU TWO
I GLANCED ROUND THE ROOM JUST AT THAT MOMENT A WAITER FROM THE RESTAURANT PRESENTED HIMSELF HE BROUGHT ME A CARD UPON A SALVER THE GENTLEMAN ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU THIS SIR HE ANNOUNCED I PICKED IT UP
AT ANY RATE HE CLAIMS IT NOW IF HIS CLAIM IS A JUST ONE AND IF YOU CAN TELL ME MISTER PARKER IS A FRIEND OF YOURS WHY THAT ENDS THE MATTER SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED
AND OTHERS OF WHOM I HAD SEEN LITTLE AT DINNER TIME I KEPT LOOKING ANXIOUSLY ROUND AND AT LAST THE BLOW FELL THE DOOR OPENED AND LORD REGINALD SIDLEY WAS ANNOUNCED
CHAPTER SIX THE PARTY AT THE MILAN THE DINNER PARTY WHICH I ARRANGED FOR IN THE MILAN RESTAURANT WAS ON THE WHOLE A GREAT SUCCESS MY SISTER PLAYED HOSTESS FOR ME
YOU CANNOT SIR MISTER PARKER TOLD ME EVE HAS A LITTLE BUSINESS OF HER OWN OR RATHER MINE TO ATTEND TO THIS MORNING YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LET HER RUN ANY MORE RISKS ARE YOU MISTER PARKER FROWNED AT ME
HIS FATHER IS AN EARL ANYWAY HIS UNCLE'S ONE REGGIE PUT IN GLOOMILY JERKING HIS HEAD TOWARD ME OLD WALMSLEY'S ALL RIGHT EVE PATTED HIS HAND GOOD BOY SHE SAID YOU KNOW I NEVER ENCOURAGED YOU
AND BROACHED THE SUBJECT OF REGGIE'S VISIT AS DELICATELY AS I COULD YOU REMEMBER LORD REGGIE SIDLEY I ASKED LORD REGGIE WHAT EVE EXCLAIMED SIDLEY I REPEATED FIRMLY
I PASSED MY ARM THROUGH HIS AND LED HIM OUT TOWARD THE FOYER YOU SEEM I DECLARED BITTERLY TO HAVE CHOSEN THE MOST UNFORTUNATE PERSONALITY I WISH TO GOODNESS YOU HAD REMAINED MISTER PARKER
THE HALL PORTER FOLLOWED ME HE WAS DRAWING SOMETHING FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET I WOULDN'T DO A THING HE DECLARED TO GET MISTER PARKER INTO ANY TROUBLE FOR A NICER FREER HANDED GENTLEMAN NEVER CAME INSIDE THE HOTEL
SMALL WORLD IT IS
I CORRECTED MYSELF HASTILY THAT I HAVE OFFERED TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH YOU AND YOUR FATHER IN ANY OF YOUR ENTERPRISES I AM PERFECTLY WILLING TO GIVE UP ANYTHING IN LIFE YOU MAY CONSIDER TOO RESPECTABLE AT THE SAME TIME I MUST SAY
MISTER AND MISSUS SAMUELSON WERE BEING ENTERTAINED BY SOME FRIENDS CLOSE AT HAND AND THEY APPEARED VERY MUCH GRATIFIED AT THE CORDIALITY OF OUR GREETING I TALKED WITH MISTER SAMUELSON DURING THE EVENING AND I FELT THAT SO FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED AT ANY RATE
BUT SHE SWUNG ROUND AT MY ENTRANCE AND HELD OUT BOTH HER HANDS THE FLOWERS ARE LOVELY SHE MURMURED
AND SAW AT ONCE THE MAN FROM WHOSE SCRUTINY HARVEY BIRCH HAD WARNED THEM THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE APPREHENDED YOU HAVE NO CAUSE FOR ALARM LADIES SAID THE OFFICER PAUSING A MOMENT AND CONTEMPLATING THE PALE FACES AROUND HIM
HAD WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEW GOOD FIRES UPON THEM IN FLANK WE SHOULD HAVE SENT THESE BRAVE VIRGINIANS TO THE RIGHT ABOUT AYE AND THAT IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME CRIED THE COLONEL MAKING THE OTHER LEG FOLLOW ITS COMPANION THEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO ROUT THE GUIDES YOU KNOW AND THE MOVEMENT GAVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE
NAY MY DEAR SITGREAVES SAID THE YOUTH TAKING HIS HAND YOU SEE THERE IS NO FEVER ABOUT ME LOOK IS THERE ANY OF JACK LAWTON'S HOARFROST ON MY TONGUE NO INDEED SAID THE SURGEON CLAPPING A SPOON IN THE MOUTH OF THE OTHER FORCING IT OPEN AND LOOKING DOWN HIS THROAT AS IF DISPOSED TO VISIT THE INTERIOR IN PERSON
BUT FREQUENTLY THROUGH A DREAD OF FUTURE DEPREDATIONS FROM THE COMMISERATION OF THEIR NEIGHBORS ALSO ADDITIONAL DUTIES HAD DRAWN THE LADIES FROM THEIR PILLOWS AT AN HOUR SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN USUAL AND CAPTAIN LAWTON
THOUGH THE LANGUAGE OF THE SONG EXPRESSED A MEANING WHICH UNITED WITH CERTAIN EVENTS OF THAT AND THE PRECEDING DAY LEFT A SENSATION OF UNEASINESS IN THE BOSOM OF THE WARM HEARTED GIRL TO WHICH SHE HAD HITHERTO BEEN A STRANGER
A WARM HEARTED FEMALE CAN MAKE IN LOVE IN THE SHORT SPACE OF HALF AN HOUR PARTICULARLY WHERE THERE IS A PREDISPOSITION TO THE DISTEMPER SARAH FOUND THE CONVERSATION WHEN IT BEGAN TO TOUCH ON FRIENDSHIP AND SYMPATHY TOO INTERESTING TO VENTURE HER VOICE WITH A REPLY
AND IN RAISING HER EYES SHE SAW ISABELLA STUDYING HER COUNTENANCE WITH AN EARNESTNESS THAT AGAIN DROVE THE BLOOD TUMULTUOUSLY TO HER TEMPLES YOU WERE SPEAKING OF MAJOR DUNWOODIE SAID ISABELLA FAINTLY HE WAS WITH CAPTAIN SINGLETON
TOUCHED LIGHTLY ON THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE PRECEDING DAY WE LITTLE THOUGHT MISS WHARTON WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS MISTER DUNWOODIE IN YOUR HOUSE IN QUEEN STREET THAT HE WAS TO BE THE RENOWNED WARRIOR HE HAS PROVED HIMSELF SAID WELLMERE ENDEAVORING TO SMILE AWAY HIS CHAGRIN
A SECOND SOLDIER WHO WAS STATIONED NEAR THE HOUSE TO PROTECT THE HORSES OF THE OFFICERS COULD COMMAND A VIEW OF THE OUTSIDE OF THE APARTMENT AND AS IT WAS WITHOUT WINDOW OR OUTLET OF ANY KIND EXCEPTING ITS DOOR
WELL LET HER THEN BUT BE CAREFUL THAT THIS WILY PEDDLER DOES NOT GET OUT IN THE FOLDS OF HER PETTICOATS
FRANCES WITNESSED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE WOODEN TENEMENT OF THE DECEASED
DOCTOR SITGREAVES SUPPORTED HER FROM THE CHAISE AND WHEN SHE GAINED THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA SHE TURNED AN EXPRESSIVE LOOK ON THE FACE OF THE PRACTITIONER YOUR BROTHER IS OUT OF DANGER AND WISHES TO SEE YOU MISS SINGLETON SAID THE SURGEON THE LADY BURST INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS
YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WOULD MEET DEATH LIKE A MAN AND I HAVE BROUGHT YOU TO A SPOT WHERE YOU CAN TRANQUILLY ARRANGE YOUR THOUGHTS AND BE QUIET AND UNDISTURBED TIS A FEARFUL PLACE TO PREPARE FOR THE LAST CHANGE IN SAID HARVEY GAZING AROUND HIS LITTLE PRISON WITH A VACANT EYE
THAT INDUCED HIS COMPANION TO THINK THAT ALARM WAS GETTING THE MASTERY OF THE PEDDLER'S FEELINGS ACCORDINGLY
I'M SURE HARVEY HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH ALREADY FROM HAVING SO MUCH CONCERNS WITH THE RIG'LARS REPLIED THE HOUSEKEEPER HE HAS LOST HIS ALL AND MADE HIMSELF A VAGABOND THROUGH THE LAND AND I HAVE REASON TO RUE THE DAY I EVER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
UNTIL THE DRAGOON AT HIS DOOR HEARD HIS LOUD BREATHINGS
I TELL HARVEY HIS CONDUCT IS OFTEN CONDEMNABLE AND LAST NIGHT HE MADE MY WORDS GOOD BUT THE OPINIONS OF SUCH UNBELIEVERS IS NOT VERY CONSEQUENTIAL YET IT IS DREADFUL TO THINK HOW HE BEHAVES AT TIMES NOW WHEN HE THREW AWAY THE NEEDLE
AND DOCTOR SITGREAVES REMOVED ALL FURTHER APPREHENSIONS BY CONFIDENTLY PRONOUNCING THAT HE WOULD BE A WELL MAN WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
WHEN THE PALE CHEEK AND QUIVERING LIP OF ISABELLA REMOVED HER RESENTMENT IN A MOMENT IT IS TRUE MY CONJECTURE IS TRUE SPEAK TO ME MISS WHARTON I CONJURE YOU IN MERCY TO MY FEELINGS TO TELL ME DO YOU LOVE DUNWOODIE
AND FRANCES MOVED TOWARDS IT WITH THE BENEVOLENT INTENTION OF ASCERTAINING THE SITUATION OF HER GUEST WHEN THE SURPRISED GIRL SAW HER WHOM SHE HAD THOUGHT TO BE SLEEPING NOT ONLY AWAKE BUT EMPLOYED IN A MANNER
I HAVE NO COLD IN MY HEAD I FANCIED IT THEN FROM SEEING YOU HAD COVERED SUCH HANDSOME BLACK LOCKS WITH THAT UGLY OLD WIG IT WAS MY MISTAKE YOU WILL PLEASE TO PARDON IT
BUT HE LEAVES HIS ROOM AND THINKS HIS WOUND LIGHTLY PURCHASED BY THE PLEASURE OF BEING WITH HIS FRIENDS IF SHE ADDED WITH A TREMULOUS LIP THIS DREADFUL SUSPICION THAT IS AFFIXED TO HIS VISIT WERE REMOVED I COULD CONSIDER HIS WOUND OF LITTLE MOMENT YOU NOW HAVE THE FRUITS OF REBELLION BROUGHT HOME TO YOU
WHY YES ALL THAT IS WELL ENOUGH RETURNED THE OTHER BUT JUSTICE SHOULD BE DONE WHILE THERE IS OPPORTUNITY THERE HAVE BEEN STIRRING TIMES IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE THE WAR BEGAN AND MANY HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR RIGHTFUL GOODS
GO GO POOR WRETCH AND MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH GOD FOR IT IS HE ONLY THAT CAN BE OF SERVICE TO YOU NOW THE SERGEANT TOOK UP THE LANTERN AND WITH SOME INDIGNATION IN HIS MANNER HE LEFT THE PEDDLER TO SORROWFUL MEDITATIONS ON HIS APPROACHING FATE
BEFORE IT WAS SUCCEEDED BY ANOTHER EQUALLY POWERFUL AND EQUALLY ATTRACTIVE ADMIRATION AND SORROW WERE HOWEVER THE PREPONDERATING PASSIONS THE LATTER WAS INDICATED BY LARGE DROPS THAT FELL FROM HER EYES ON THE PICTURE
HER BEAUTIFUL EYES SPARKLED WITH RENOVATED BRILLIANCY AND HER FACE WAS LIGHTED WITH SMILES SO FASCINATING THAT FRANCES WHO IN COMPLIANCE WITH HER EARNEST ENTREATIES HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE SICK CHAMBER SAT GAZING ON A COUNTENANCE THAT POSSESSED SO WONDERFUL VARIABILITY
HER LAST NIGHT'S JOURNEYING HAD ROBBED HER THE APARTMENT OF MISS SINGLETON COMMUNICATED WITH THE ROOM OCCUPIED BY THE SISTERS THROUGH A PRIVATE DOOR AS WELL AS THROUGH THE ORDINARY PASSAGE OF THE HOUSE THIS DOOR WAS PARTLY OPEN
AND A SANCTUARY FOR HER PERSON THE SPARE ARMS AND BAGGAGE OF THE CORPS HAD ALSO BEEN DEPOSITED HERE AND THE UNITED TREASURES WERE PLACED UNDER THE EYE OF THE SENTINEL WHO PARADED THE SHED AS A GUARDIAN OF THE REAR OF THE HEADQUARTERS
YOU MAY KEEP YOURSELF WARM BY DANCING JOHN THE PEDDLER SPY HAS TUNED HIS FIDDLE YOU HEAR AND IT WILL NOT BE LONG BEFORE BETTY WILL STRIKE UP IN HER TURN THE JOKE WAS FOLLOWED BY A GENERAL LAUGH FROM THE PARTY WHO MARCHED ON IN PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTY
IT IS PRESUMPTUOUS IN YOU TO PRETEND TO TELL YOUR MEDICAL ATTENDANT WHEN YOU ARE FREE FROM PAIN IF IT BE NOT TO ENABLE US TO DECIDE IN SUCH MATTERS OF WHAT AVAIL THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE FOR SHAME GEORGE FOR SHAME EVEN THAT PERVERSE FELLOW JOHN LAWTON COULD NOT BEHAVE WITH MORE OBSTINACY
IT IS TRUE HE WANTED THE PERSONAL EXCELLENCE OF PEYTON DUNWOODIE BUT HIS PRETENSIONS WERE FAR FROM CONTEMPTIBLE SARAH HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE MORNING CASTING FREQUENT AND LONGING GLANCES AT THE DOOR OF WELLMERE'S APARTMENT ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE CONDITION OF HIS WOUNDS AND YET ASHAMED TO INQUIRE
THE DOCTOR HAD WATCHED DURING THE NIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE BED OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON WITHOUT ONCE CLOSING HIS EYES OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD PAY A VISIT TO THE WOUNDED ENGLISHMAN WHO BEING MORE HURT IN THE SPIRIT THAN IN THE FLESH
OF THE WASHERWOMAN WHO LAY BEFORE THE KITCHEN FIRE DREAMING THAT THE CORPS WAS ATTACKING A PARTY OF THE ENEMY
WHY RETURNED THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATING A LITTLE I THOUGHT WE WERE AS GOOD AS SO I WONDER IF I HAVE NO CLAIM ON THE HOUSE AND GARDEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOW IT IS HARVEY'S IT WILL SURELY BE CONFISCATED TURNING TO LAWTON WHO HAD BEEN SITTING IN ONE POSTURE WITH HIS
HER OWN ROOM HOWEVER AFFORDED HER BUT LITTLE RELIEF AND IN PASSING THROUGH THE LONG GALLERY THAT COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OF THE CHAMBERS OF THE BUILDING SHE NOTICED THE DOOR OF SINGLETON'S ROOM TO BE OPEN THE WOUNDED YOUTH SEEMED SLEEPING AND WAS ALONE
HAD COMMITTED THE PEDDLER TRANSFERRED HIS CHARGE TO THE CUSTODY OF THE REGULAR SERGEANT OF THE GUARD THE GIFT OF CAPTAIN WHARTON HAD NOT BEEN LOST ON THE YOUTHFUL LIEUTENANT
WHO TO THE ASTONISHMENT OF THE DIFFERENT SENTINELS
THEY ARE STEALING MURDERING AND DESERTION
PIERCING EYES LOWERING AT HER THROUGH HIS THICK BROWS IN SILENCE PERHAPS THIS GENTLEMAN KNOWS HE SEEMS TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN MY STORY MADAM SAID THE TROOPER BOWING VERY LOW BOTH YOU AND THE TALE ARE EXTREMELY INTERESTING KATY SMILED INVOLUNTARILY
THE SURGEON DREW UP AND EMPLOYED HIMSELF IN WHISTLING A LOW AIR AS HE LOOKED OVER SOME PHIALS ON A TABLE BUT THE HOUSEKEEPER TURNING TO HIM WITH AN INCLINATION OF THE HEAD CONTINUED I SUPPOSE SIR A WOMAN HAS NO DOWER IN HER HUSBAND'S PROPERTY UNLESS THEY BE ACTUALLY MARRIED
ON THE MARCH ISABELLA EAGERLY INQUIRED HER BROTHER NO DISMOUNTED AND SEEMINGLY AT REST WAS THE REPLY THE WONDERING DRAGOON TURNED HIS GAZE ON THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS SISTER WHO SAT WITH HER EYE BENT ON THE CARPET IN UNCONSCIOUS ABSENCE BUT FOUND NO EXPLANATION
TIS THOUGHT YOU HAVE LITTLE TO APPREHEND FOR YOUR BROTHER SAID FRANCES IN THE SAME EMBARRASSED MANNER HAD YOU SEEN HIM WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT IN BY MAJOR DUNWOODIE FRANCES PAUSED WITH A FEELING OF CONSCIOUS SHAME
THE SOBS OF MISS SINGLETON FOR A TIME WERE VIOLENT AND UNCONTROLLABLE UNTIL WITH AN EVIDENT EXERTION SHE YIELDED TO A KIND OBSERVATION OF HER COMPANION AND SUCCEEDED IN SUPPRESSING HER TEARS RAISING HER FACE TO THE EYES OF FRANCES SHE ROSE
THE MAJOR CONSIDERATE DUNWOODIE MURMURED THE EXHAUSTED YOUTH SINKING AGAIN ON HIS PILLOW WHERE THE COMMANDS OF HIS ATTENDANT COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN SILENT EVEN CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN RECEIVED WITH MANY AND COURTEOUS INQUIRIES AFTER THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH
IT WAS ALWAYS SAID OF ME THAT I WANTED NOTHING BUT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE QUITE A PHYSICIAN MYSELF SO LONG AS BEFORE I CAME TO LIVE WITH HARVEY'S FATHER THEY CALLED ME THE PETTICOAT DOCTOR MORE TRUE THAN CIVIL I DARE SAY RETURNED THE SURGEON LOSING SIGHT OF THE WOMAN'S CHARACTER IN HIS ADMIRATION OF HER RESPECT FOR THE HEALING ART
HAD HE RECOGNIZED ME AT THE OPERA OR HAD HE NOT HAD HE SHED TEARS FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON WHAT WOULD IT MATTER SO LONG AS I WAS HAPPY BUT WHILE UNABLE TO DIVINE THE CAUSE OF BRIGITTE'S SORROW
NO DISORDER EVERYTHING IS REGULATED MARKED OUT WRITTEN DOWN IN LINES OF GOLD AND PARABLES OF FIRE EVERYTHING KEEPS STEP WITH THE CELESTIAL MUSIC ALONG THE PITILESS PATHS OF LIFE AND ALL FOR NOTHING
NEVERTHELESS OUR PREPARATIONS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY AND I BECAME IMPATIENT TO GET AWAY AT THE SAME TIME I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I COULD HARDLY REST
WHO KNOWS WHEN THE PRESENT WHICH MAKES YOU SHUDDER SHALL HAVE BECOME THE PAST AN OLD STORY A CONFUSED MEMORY MAY IT NOT HAPPEN SOME NIGHT OF DEBAUCHERY THAT YOU WILL OVERTURN YOUR CHAIR AND RECOUNT WITH A SMILE ON YOUR LIPS WHAT YOU WITNESSED WITH TEARS IN YOUR EYES
SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF GREATEST DESPAIR
I STOPPED BEFORE THE SLEEPER WHAT SLEEP I SAID SURELY THIS MAN DOES NOT DREAM HIS CLOTHES ARE IN TATTERS HIS CHEEKS ARE WRINKLED HIS HANDS HARDENED WITH TOIL
AND IT WAS SHE WHO WITH HER PALE HALF MOCKING FEATURES
I REMAINED FOR A LONG TIME IN THIS STRANGE CALM JUST AS THE MAN WHO RECEIVES A THRUST FROM A POIGNARD FEELS AT FIRST ONLY THE COLD STEEL WHEN HE HAS GONE SOME DISTANCE ON HIS WAY HE BECOMES WEAK HIS EYES START FROM THEIR SOCKETS AND HE ASKS WHAT HAS HAPPENED
AND YOU DO NOT BELIEVE YOURSELF GUILTY I DEMANDED WITH HORROR O NOVICE OF YESTERDAY HOW CORRUPT TO DAY BECAUSE YOU WEEP YOU FONDLY IMAGINE YOURSELF INNOCENT WHAT YOU CONSIDER THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR CONSCIENCE IS ONLY REMORSE AND WHAT MURDERER DOES NOT EXPERIENCE IT
WHEN I AROSE IN THE MORNING AND THE SUN WAS SHINING THROUGH OUR WINDOWS I EXPERIENCED SUCH TRANSPORTS OF JOY THAT I WAS ALMOST INTOXICATED WITH HAPPINESS
WHILE NOT BELIEVING IN HIM MYSELF I RECOILED KNOWING THAT SHE BELIEVED IN HIM IT WAS NOT VAIN TERROR THAT ARRESTED MY HAND WHO SAW ME I WAS ALONE AND IT WAS NIGHT WAS IT PREJUDICE WHAT PREVENTED ME FROM HURLING OUT OF MY SIGHT THAT LITTLE PIECE OF BLACK WOOD
NEVER ALLOW THEM TO WHITEN IF THEY ARE NOT WHITE TO NIGHT AND THEN WHAT WOULD YOU DO IN THE WORLD IF YOU GO AWAY WHERE WILL YOU GO WHAT CAN YOU HOPE FOR IF YOU REMAIN AH IN LOOKING AT THAT WOMAN YOU SEEM TO HAVE A TREASURE BURIED IN YOUR HEART IT IS NOT MERELY THAT YOU LOSE HER
SHE CUT FROM HER HEAD A LONG TRESS OF HAIR THEN SHE LOOKED AT HERSELF THUS DISFIGURED AND DEPRIVED OF A PART OF HER BEAUTIFUL CROWN AND GAVE IT TO HER LOVER THE CLOCK STRUCK AGAIN IT WAS TIME TO GO WHEN THEY PASSED OUT THEY SEEMED AS JOYFUL AS WHEN THEY ENTERED
I THREW BACK THE BEDCLOTHING TO UNCOVER THE HEART WHEN I DISCOVERED ON HER WHITE BOSOM A LITTLE EBONY CRUCIFIX I RECOILED SEIZED WITH SUDDEN FEAR MY HAND RELAXED MY WEAPON FELL TO THE FLOOR IT WAS BRIGITTE'S AUNT WHO HAD GIVEN HER THAT LITTLE CRUCIFIX ON HER DEATH BED
I DID NOT REMEMBER EVER HAVING SEEN IT BEFORE DOUBTLESS AT THE MOMENT OF SETTING OUT SHE HAD SUSPENDED IT ABOUT HER NECK AS A PRESERVING CHARM AGAINST THE DANGERS OF THE JOURNEY SUDDENLY I JOINED MY HANDS AND KNELT ON THE FLOOR
I AM UNWILLING TO KILL THIS WOMAN SO I HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO LEAVE HER IT IS ALL OVER I SHALL GO AWAY TO MORROW AND ALL THE WHILE I WAS THINKING NEITHER OF MY RESPONSIBILITY NOR OF THE PAST NOR FUTURE
MY RIVAL IS DOUBTLESS PASSING THE NIGHT WITH MY MISTRESS HE WILL LEAVE HER AT DAYBREAK SHE WILL ACCOMPANY HIM TO THE DOOR AND THEY WILL SEE ME ASLEEP ON MY BENCH
WHO HAD OFFENDED HER THEN INSULTED HER THEN ABANDONED HER ONLY TO TAKE HER BACK AGAIN TREMBLING WITH FEAR BESET WITH SUSPICION FINALLY THROWN ON THAT BED OF SORROW WHERE SHE NOW LAY EXTENDED WAS I
NO MY FRIEND FOR YOU MUST KNOW THAT I COULD NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN WITHOUT LOVING YOU MAY HE TO WHOM I BEQUEATH YOU BE WORTHY OF YOU SMITH IS BRAVE GOOD AND HONEST BUT HOWEVER MUCH YOU MAY LOVE HIM
I ALTERNATED BETWEEN TEARS AND LAUGHTER AND I NEVER SPOKE OF THE PAST EXCEPT WITH HORROR AND DISGUST OUR ROOM WAS FULL OF OUR GOODS SCATTERED ABOUT IN DISORDER
HOW CAN ANY ONE ENDURE THOSE GRILLED WINDOWS AND THAT HORRIBLE BROWN COLOR WITH WHICH ALL THE HOUSES ARE SOILED WHAT COULD WE DO AT ROME WE ARE NOT TRAVELING IN ORDER TO FORGET OURSELVES
AND ADMIRATION AND LOVE RESUMED THEIR SWAY IN MY HEART BRIGITTE AND I EXAMINED A MAP TO DETERMINE WHERE WE SHOULD GO TO BURY OURSELVES FROM THE WORLD WE HAD NOT YET DECIDED
WE HAVE WRITTEN AND REVISED THE LAWS BOTH HUMAN AND DIVINE AND WE ARE AFRAID OF OUR CATECHISMS WE SUFFER THIRTY YEARS WITHOUT MURMURING AND IMAGINE THAT WE ARE STRUGGLING FINALLY SUFFERING BECOMES THE STRONGER WE SEND A PINCH OF POWDER INTO THE SANCTUARY OF INTELLIGENCE
WHATEVER COURAGE BRIGITTE HAD SHOWN SHE HAD DRUNK TO THE DREGS THE BITTER CUP OF HER SAD LOVE UNLESS I WISHED TO SEE HER DIE I MUST GIVE HER REPOSE
I AM A FOOL A MADMAN A CHILD WHO THINKS HIMSELF A MAN GOD BE PRAISED YOU ARE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL YOU LIVE AND YOU WILL FORGET ME
IT IS LESS WHAT HAS BEEN THAN WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WHEN THE HANDS OF THE CLOCK INDICATED SUCH AND SUCH AN HOUR YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAPPY IF YOU SUFFER WHY DO YOU NOT OPEN YOUR HEART IF YOU LOVE WHY DO YOU NOT SAY SO WHY DO YOU DIE OF HUNGER CLASPING A PRICELESS TREASURE IN YOUR HANDS
BUT AN INSTINCT PERSISTENT AND FATAL WHAT STRANGE CREATURES WE IT PLEASED ME TO LEAVE THEM ALONE BEFORE THE FIRE AND TO GO OUT
UNWILLING TO CALL ANY ONE I LIGHTED BRIGITTE'S LAMP I WATCHED ITS FEEBLE FLAME AND MY THOUGHTS SEEMED TO FLICKER IN THE DARKNESS LIKE ITS UNCERTAIN RAYS WHATEVER I HAD SAID OR DONE THE IDEA OF LOSING BRIGITTE HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO ME UP TO THIS TIME
THEN RETURNED AND RESUMED MY SEAT I COULD NOT LEAVE THAT DOOR AT WHICH I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOCKED FOR AN EMPIRE
AND WE TOOK A FURNISHED APARTMENT FOR ONE MONTH THE DECISION TO LEAVE FRANCE HAD CHANGED EVERYTHING
WHILE THERE IS STILL SOME VIRTUE LEFT PROFIT BY IT IN ORDER THAT YOU MAY NOT BECOME ALTOGETHER BAD WHILE A WOMAN YOU LOVE LIES THERE DYING ON THAT BED AND WHILE YOU HAVE A HORROR OF YOURSELF STRIKE THE DECISIVE BLOW SHE STILL LIVES THAT IS ENOUGH
GIVE ME YOUR HAND AND LET THE WORLD LAUGH AT A WORD THAT IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND LET US BE FRIENDS AND ADIEU FOREVER BEFORE WE BECAME SUCH INTIMATE FRIENDS THERE WAS SOMETHING WITHIN THAT TOLD US THAT WE WERE DESTINED TO MINGLE OUR LIVES
WHENEVER I ATTEMPTED TO PERSUADE HER TO SPEAK FRANKLY SHE ASSURED ME THAT THE LETTER WAS THE ONLY CAUSE OF HER MELANCHOLY AND BEGGED ME TO SAY NOTHING MORE ABOUT IT THEN I TRIED IN VAIN TO GUESS
ANOTHER ANOTHER I REPEATED BENDING OVER HER UNTIL MY HEAD TOUCHED HER SHOULDER IS SHE NOT A WIDOW HAS SHE NOT ALREADY SEEN DEATH HAVE NOT THESE LITTLE HANDS PREPARED THE DEAD FOR BURIAL
A PART OF THE MONEY LEFT BY THEIR FATHER
YOU HAVE CLOSED THE DOOR YOU MISER YOU DEBATE WITH YOURSELF BEHIND LOCKS AND BOLTS SHAKE THEM FOR IT WAS YOUR HAND THAT FORGED THEM O FOOL WHO HAVE DESIRED AND HAVE POSSESSED YOUR DESIRE YOU HAVE NOT THOUGHT OF GOD
WHEN SMITH LEFT US IN THE EVENING WE EITHER KEPT SILENCE OR TALKED OF HIM I DO NOT KNOW WHAT FATAL ATTRACTION LED ME TO ASK ABOUT HIM CONTINUALLY
IF THAT YOUNG MAN HAD ARRIVED AT THE TIME OF OUR GREATEST HAPPINESS HAD HE BROUGHT AN INSIGNIFICANT LETTER TO BRIGITTE HAD HE PRESSED HER HAND WHILE ASSISTING HER INTO THE CARRIAGE WOULD I HAVE PAID THE LEAST ATTENTION TO IT
AND COVERED WITH A LINEN CLOTH SATISFIED WITH HIS WORK
THAT MINGLING OF STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS OF JOY AND SORROW OF ANXIETY AND SERENITY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDERSTOOD BY AN INDIFFERENT SPECTATOR AT TIMES THEY APPEARED THE MOST HAPPY OF LIVING CREATURES AND THE NEXT MOMENT THE MOST UNHAPPY
THE HAPPY OF THIS WORLD THINK THEY HAVE NO NEED OF THEE PARDON THEM ALTHOUGH THEIR PRIDE MAY OUTRAGE THEE THEY WILL BE SOONER OR LATER BAPTIZED IN TEARS GRANT THAT THEY MAY CEASE TO BELIEVE IN ANY OTHER SHELTER FROM THE TEMPEST THAN THY LOVE
MY MISSION WILL HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND I SHALL ALWAYS BE THANKFUL FOR IT FINALLY WE DECIDED TO GO TO GENEVA AND THEN CHOOSE SOME RESTING PLACE IN THE ALPS
SO ANXIOUS WAS I TO PROVE THE SINCERITY OF MY LOVE FOR BRIGITTE THAT I HARDLY DARED KISS THE HEM OF HER DRESS HER LIGHTEST WORDS MADE ME TREMBLE AS THOUGH HER VOICE WAS STRANGE TO ME
SHE HAD OFTEN ADDRESSED CRUEL REPROACHES TO ME AND HAD PERHAPS ON CERTAIN OTHER OCCASIONS SHOWN MORE ANGER THAN IN THIS SCENE BUT WHAT SHE HAD SAID THIS TIME WAS NOT DICTATED BY OFFENDED PRIDE IT WAS THE TRUTH WHICH HIDDEN CLOSELY IN HER HEART
YOU SEE VERY WELL THAT YOU STILL LOVE ME FOR IF I SHOULD DECIDE TO REMAIN OR TO TAKE YOU AWAY WITH ME YOU WOULD CONSENT IT IS TRUE REPLIED THE WOMAN TRUE TRUE REPEATED THE YOUNG MAN LOOKING INTO HER EYES WITH ALL HIS SOUL
WOULD YOU LIKE IT DEAREST HE ASKED OR WOULD YOU PREFER TO GO ON LIVING JUST AS WE HAVE BEEN YOU AND I TOGETHER I WOULD CONSULT YOUR HAPPINESS BEFORE MY OWN FOR IT LIES VERY NEAR MY HEART MY PRECIOUS ONE
I KNOW YOU LOVE YOUR FOOLISH LITTLE DAUGHTER VERY DEARLY ALMOST AS DEARLY AS SHE LOVES YOU ALMOST DARLING IF THERE WERE ANY GAUGE BY WHICH TO MEASURE LOVE I KNOW NOT WHOSE WOULD BE FOUND THE GREATEST
YOU HAVE BROKEN HIS LAW AND HIS JUSTICE DEMANDS YOUR PUNISHMENT
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW SADLY WE HAVE MISSED YOU THIS SUMMER MAMMA I DO FEEL IT TO BE VERY VERY SWEET TO BE SO LOVED AND CARED FOR I COULD NOT TELL YOU HOW DEAR YOU AND MY LITTLE BROTHER ARE TO ME AND AS FOR PAPA
COME ELSIE WE MUST GO THE CARRIAGE IS WAITING AND THE TRAIN NEARLY DUE SAID MISTER DINSMORE GOOD BYE AUNT WEALTHY DAUGHTER PUT DOWN YOUR VEIL EGERTON WAS AT THE DEPOT
MISTER AND MISSUS DINSMORE WERE STILL YOUTHFUL IN THEIR FEELINGS AND JOINED WITH GREAT ZEST IN THE SPORTS OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE GOING WITH THEM IN ALL THEIR EXCURSIONS TAKING AN ACTIVE PART IN ALL THEIR PASTIMES
IF HE HAD HIS DESERTS HE WOULD BE IN THE STATE'S PRISON AND TO THINK OF HIS DARING TO APPROACH MY CHILD AND EVEN ASPIRE TO HER HAND ELSIE LAY ALL NIGHT IN A PROFOUND SLUMBER
SHE ROSE TO BEGIN THE NEW DAY MORE CHEERFUL AND HOPEFUL THAN SHE HAD BEEN SINCE LEARNING HER FATHER'S DECISION IN REGARD TO EGERTON THROWING ON A DRESSING GOWN OVER HER NIGHT DRESS
LET US START TO MORROW PAPA CAN'T WE BUT YOU KNOW YOU WILL HAVE TO LEAVE MISS ROSE AH I FORGOT THAT SHE SAID A LITTLE SADLY BUT BRIGHTENING AGAIN SHE ASKED COULDN'T YOU INVITE HER TO GO HOME WITH US AND SPEND THE WINTER AH PAPA DO
BEFORE DOING THAT WE SHOULD BE VERY SURE OF GOING TO A BETTER PLACE BUT HOW CAN WE BE SURE OF THAT OR INDEED OF ANYTHING WHAT IS THERE THAT WE KNOW ABSOLUTELY AND BEYOND QUESTION HOW CAN I BE SURE OF EVEN MY OWN EXISTENCE
HAD BEEN SECURED IN ADVANCE AND LATE THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY HAD ARRIVED AND TAKEN POSSESSION IT WAS NOW EARLY IN THE MORNING
BUT HERS WAS A MOST INNOCENT AND UNSUSPICIOUS NATURE APT TO BELIEVE OTHERS AS TRUE AND HONEST AS HERSELF SHE WENT ON PRESENTLY IT IS SO BEAUTIFULLY SIMPLE AND EASY GOD'S WAY OF SAVING US POOR SINNERS
SAID ROSE SMILING YOU DON'T WISH ANY SUCH THING ON THE CONTRARY YOU WOULD BE THE VERY FIRST TO FLY TO THE RESCUE IF YOU SAW HER IN DANGER OF DROWNING BUT BEFORE THERE WAS TIME FOR ANYTHING MORE TO BE SAID MISS STEVENS HAD RETURNED
WHICH WAS IN THE SECOND STORY AND OPENED UPON A VERANDA SHADED BY TALL TREES AND OVERLOOKING A LARGE GRASSY YARD AT THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING BEYOND WERE GREEN FIELDS WOODS AND HILLS
AND THE DINSMORES TRAVELLING THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW YORK FROM ONE ROMANTIC AND PICTURESQUE SPOT TO ANOTHER FINISHING UP WITH TWO OR THREE WEEKS IN PHILADELPHIA DURING WHICH ROSE AND ELSIE WERE MUCH OCCUPIED WITH THEIR FALL AND WINTER SHOPPING
AND WITH A HEART FULL OF DEEP PASSIONATE LOVE FOR HER HER FATHER UNDERSTOOD AND SYMPATHIZED WITH IT ALL HE PASSED HIS ARM ABOUT HER WAIST DREW HER CLOSER TO HIM
BUT WHAT AM I TO DO
EXCLAIMED THE LITTLE GIRL WARMLY AH WELL DEAR HE SAID IN A SOOTHING TONE WE WON'T TALK ANY MORE ABOUT IT I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I DO NOT FIND MISS STEVENS THE MOST AGREEABLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD BUT I MUST TREAT HER
SHE WAS ABSENT BUT A FEW MOMENTS FROM THE PARLOR WHERE SHE HAD LEFT HER FATHER BUT WHEN SHE RETURNED TO IT HE WAS NOT THERE MISS ROSE TOO WAS GONE SHE FOUND UPON FURTHER SEARCH
AS SHE FOLLOWED HIM INTO HIS ROOM ON THEIR RETURN FROM THEIR WALK WHAT MY DEAR WHY PAPA I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE SUCH A NICE TIME AND SHE JUST SPOILED IT ALL SHE WHO DAUGHTER
HE SAID WITH A VERY GRAVE LOOK AS HE DREW HER TO HIS SIDE YOU FORGET THAT WE OUGHT NOT TO SPEAK OF OTHER PEOPLE'S FAULTS I WILL TRY NOT TO DO IT ANY MORE PAPA SHE REPLIED THE TEARS SPRINGING TO HER EYES
HE WROTE TO ARTHUR THAT THE PRIZE WAS NEARLY WON SO NEARLY THAT HE HAD NO DOUBT OF HIS ULTIMATE SUCCESS AND I'LL NOT BE LONG NOW ABOUT FINISHING UP THE JOB HE CONTINUED IT'S SUCH PRECIOUS HARD WORK TO BE SO GOOD AND PIOUS ALL THE TIME THAT I CAN HARDLY WAIT TILL MATTERS ARE FULLY RIPE FOR ACTION
FROM THIS TIME EGERTON PLAYED HIS PART WITH CONSUMMATE SKILL DECEIVING ELSIE SO COMPLETELY THAT SHE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT OF HIS BEING AN HUMBLE PENITENT REJOICING BELIEVER AND GREAT WERE HER JOY AND THANKFULNESS WHEN HE TOLD HER THAT SHE HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF LEADING HIM TO CHRIST THAT HER WORDS HAD MADE THE WAY PLAIN TO HIM AS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT BEFORE
AND CONTENT TO BEAR THE CROSS HE HAD SENT HER
AH THERE IS MISS ROSE LOOKING FOR ME I MUST GO
SAID THE CHILD BENDING A GAZE OF KEEN LOVING SCRUTINY UPON THE SWEET FACE PALER SADDER AND MORE HEAVY EYED THAN HE HAD EVER SEEN IT BEFORE SISTER IS TIRED WITH HER JOURNEY SAID MAMMA TENDERLY WE WON'T TEASE HER TO NIGHT
FROM THE FIRST HE SEEMED TO BE A PERFECT GENTLEMAN EDUCATED POLISHED AND REFINED AND AFTERWARD HE BECAME AT LEAST SO I THOUGHT FROM THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD TOGETHER TRULY CONVERTED AND A VERY EARNEST DEVOTED CHRISTIAN
AND LOOKING OUT UPON THE SEA WHOSE DARK WAVES HERE AND THERE TIPPED WITH FOAM COULD BE DIMLY SEEN ROLLING AND TOSSING BENEATH THE LIGHT OF THE STARS AND OF A YOUNG MOON THAT HUNG LIKE A GOLDEN CRESCENT JUST ABOVE THE HORIZON
YOU'LL GO IN WITH US TO MORROW WON'T YOU ELSIE NO SAID MISTER DINSMORE SPEAKING FOR HIS DAUGHTER SHE MUST BE HERE TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE SHE GOES INTO THE WATER IT WILL BE ALTOGETHER BETTER FOR HER HEALTH
IT WILL BE MOONLIGHT NEXT WEEK SAID SOPHY AND WE'LL HAVE SOME DELIGHTFUL DRIVES AND WALKS ALONG THE BEACH THE SEA DOES LOOK SO LOVELY BY MOONLIGHT
YES PAPA AND THEN SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT TO MORROW WON'T SHE BUT MAMMA I WASN'T TEASING HER NOT A BIT WAS I ELSIE AND IF ANYBODY'S BEEN MAKING HER SORRY I'LL KILL HIM CAUSE SHE'S MY SISTER
I'D BE HAPPY SIR AT ANY TIME WHEN YOU CAN MAKE IT CONVENIENT FOR ME TO SEE YOU HERE WITH HORACE AND THE CHILD OR WITHOUT THEM THANK YOU MISS STANHOPE AND MOTHER AND I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU AT ION
AND WALKING STRAIGHT UP TO MISTER DINSMORE SHE PUT HER ARM THROUGH HIS SAYING WITH A LITTLE LAUGH AND WHAT WAS MEANT FOR A VERY ARCH EXPRESSION YOU SEE I DON'T STAND UPON CEREMONY WITH OLD FRIENDS MISTER DINSMORE IT ISN'T MY WAY
MUTTERED ARTHUR ANGRILY
SO CROSSLY ELSIE WHAT PAPA SHE ASKED BLUSHING AGAIN FOR HIS TONE WAS REPROVING COME HERE AND SIT ON MY KNEE I WANT TO TALK TO YOU I AM AFRAID MY LITTLE DAUGHTER IS GROWING CENSORIOUS
THEN THE TRAIN CAME THUNDERING UP AND THE FAIR GIRL WAS HURRIED INTO IT MISTER TRAVILLA ON ONE SIDE AND HER FATHER ON THE OTHER EFFECTUALLY PREVENTING ANY NEAR APPROACH TO HER PERSON ON THE PART OF THE BAFFLED AND DISAPPOINTED FORTUNE HUNTER
I THINK YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER THE COMMAND TO BE COURTEOUS PAPA SHE SAID LOOKING AFFECTIONATELY INTO HIS FACE I WAS WONDERING ALL THE TIME HOW YOU COULD BE SO VERY POLITE TO MISS STEVENS
COGITO ERGO SUM SHE ANSWERED GAYLY ALSO I AM SURE WE HAVE HAD A VERY PLEASANT WALK BUT ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE MOVING TOWARD HOME YES ELSIE ANSWERED CONSULTING HER WATCH THAT'S A PRETTY LITTLE THING OBSERVED EGERTON MAY I LOOK AT IT
AND BESIDES YOU FORGET ABOUT THE TROUBLESOME LITTLE GIRL I HAVE HEARD LADIES SAY THEY WOULD NOT MARRY A MAN WHO HAD A CHILD BUT MISS ROSE LOVES ME PAPA
OF HIS NEVER FAILING LOVE TO HER AND OF THE MANY GREAT AND PRECIOUS PROMISES OF HIS WORD SHE REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD SAID YOUR FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF ALL THESE THINGS
AND AS HE SPOKE HE DREW HER CLOSER AND CLOSER TO HIM AND KISSED HER TENDERLY AGAIN AND AGAIN SPEAK DAUGHTER AND TELL ME WHAT YOU WISH HE SAID AS SHE STILL REMAINED SILENT
NO SIR I WON'T ELSIE ANSWERED WITH A BLUSH BUT PAPA SHE ADDED THE NEXT MOMENT MISS STEVENS DOES THAT CONSTANTLY THAT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE MY DAUGHTER HE SAID GRAVELY MISS STEVENS IS THE VERY LAST PERSON
NOT ONLY OF TOLERANCE BUT OF POSITIVE LIKING IN HER HAUGHTY COUSIN'S DEMEANOUR AND WONDERED AFTER ALL WHETHER DORCAS WAS BEGINNING TO LIKE SIR HARRY BRACTON DORCAS HAD ALWAYS PUZZLED HER
RACHEL BEHELD THE THINGS WHICH WERE COMING TO PASS LIKE AN AWFUL DREAM SHE HAD BEGUN TO THINK AND NOT WITHOUT EVIDENCE THAT DORCAS FOR SOME CAUSE OR CAPRICE HAD CEASED TO THINK OF STANLEY AS SHE ONCE DID
IT PERHAPS INDICATED AN ANXIETY AND A MENTAL LOOK OUT IN THAT DIRECTION FOR HE REALLY EXPECTED NO SUCH THING
THE WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC WITH A WIDE PANEL OVER ITS DOOR PRESENTING IN TINTS SUBDUED BY TIME A STAGE COACH AND FOUR HORSES IN MID CAREER LAY A FEW HUNDRED YARDS NEARER TO GYLINGDEN
UNTIL THE OLD BRANDON TYPE REAPPEARED
WITH A DREADFUL YEARNING HE HATED THE FRESH GLITTER OF THAT MORNING SCENE WHY SHOULD THE WORLD BE CHEERFUL IT WAS A REPAST SPREAD OF WHICH HE COULD NOT PARTAKE AND IT SPITED HIM
STANLEY LAKE LOOKED AT HER WITH A GAZE AT ONCE PEEVISH AND INQUISITIVE YOU TAKE A WONDERFULLY SERIOUS VIEW OF RACHEL'S NONSENSE I DO
WITH HIS WALKING CANE IF HE COULD AND DRAPED THE WORLD IN BLACK HE SAW FROM HIS WINDOW THE
AND LAKE PULLED ON HIS WHITE GLOVE GLANCING DOWN THE FILE OF SILENT WAITERS SOME LOOKING FRIGHTENED AND SOME RESERVED IN WHITE TIES AND WAISTCOATS AND HE GLIDED OUT OF THE ROOM HIS MIND SOMEWHERE ELSE
OF ACTING SENTRY AND WAS VERY PEEVISH BY THE TIME THE RING OF WHEELS AND HORSE HOOFS APPROACHING FROM THE LONDON DIRECTION BECAME AUDIBLE EVEN SO HE HAD A LONGER WAIT THAN HE EXPECTED
I WAS ROMANTIC LIKE EVERY OTHER YOUNGISH FELLOW WHO IS NOT A PREMATURE CURMUDGEON
AND COULD GIVE ME SATISFACTORY ANSWERS UPON POINTS ON WHICH MY MIND HAS BEEN EMPLOYED FOR SOME DAYS AND INDEED I THINK I'VE A RIGHT TO ASK THAT ASSISTANCE OF YOU YOU SEEM TO FORGET YOUNG LADY THAT THERE ARE TIMES AND PLACES FOR SUCH DISCUSSIONS
AND DREW IT UNCOMMON MILD AND HE HAS BEEN USEFUL TO ME AND I THINK MATTERS ARE PRETTY WELL ARRANGED TO DISAPPOINT THE KIND INTENTION OF GOOD UNCLE WYLDER THE BRUTE HE HATED MY FATHER BUT THAT WAS NO REASON TO PERSECUTE ME AND I BUT AN INFANT ALMOST WHEN HE DIED
THERE WAS A LITTLE FAIR HAIRED CHILD PLAYING ON THE GROUND BEFORE THE STEPS AS I WHIRLED BY THE OLD RECTOR HAD LONG PASSED AWAY THE SHORTS GAITERS AND SMILE A PHANTOM AND NATURE WHO HAD GATHERED IN THE PAST WAS PROVIDING FOR THE FUTURE
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE IN WHICH CAPTAIN LAKE VISITS HIS SISTER'S SICK BED I SUSPECT THERE ARE VERY FEW MERE HYPOCRITES ON EARTH OF COURSE I DO NOT RECKON THOSE
SHE IS VERY CHARMING AND CLEVER OF COURSE SO LONG AS SHE SPEAKS OF THE KIND OF THING SHE UNDERSTANDS BUT WHEN SHE TRIES TO TALK OF SERIOUS BUSINESS
I'M VERY GLAD YOU CAME RADIE SAID A SWEET VOICE WHICH SOMEHOW MADE HER SHIVER CLOSE TO HER EAR THIS KIND OF THING WILL DO YOU GOOD AND YOU REALLY WANTED A LITTLE FILLIP
ARE CHURLISH AND FEROCIOUS OVER THEIR LOVES AS CERTAIN BRUTES ARE OVER THEIR VICTUALS IN ONE OF THESE TENDER PAROXYSMS WHEN IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS DULCINEA
AND READ TO US NOW AND THEN A SNATCH OF POETRY I FORGET WHAT MY BOOK EXCEPT WHEN I WAS THINKING OF THE TARN AND THAT OLD MAN I SO HATED WAS MISS BRANDON'S EXQUISITE AND MYSTERIOUS FACE THAT YOUNG LADY WAS LEANING BACK IN HER GREAT OAK CHAIR
HE HURT HIS BROTHER CHELFORD TURNED AWAY AND BOWED AND SMILED TO ONE OR TWO FRIENDS AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM YES THE MUSIC WAS VERY PRETTY AND SOME OF THE SONGS WERE QUITE CHARMINGLY SUNG I AGREE WITH YOU
WHEN SHE PLEASES TO EXERT HER GOOD SENSE BUT SHE CAN WHEN SHE PLEASES BOTH TALK AND ACT LIKE A FOOL AND PRAY WHAT DOES SHE WANT YOU TO DO STANLEY THE MEREST NONSENSE BUT WHAT IS IT
I'M GOING DOWN TO REDMAN'S FARM AND ANY LETTERS FOR MY SISTER MISS LAKE I MAY AS WELL TAKE WITH ME EVERYBODY IN BUSINESS IN THE TOWN OF GYLINGDEN
BUT DORCAS'S MIND RETAINED ITS FIRST IMPRESSION SOMETIMES HIS PLAUSIBILITIES HIS VEHEMENCE AND HIS VOWS DISTURBED IT FOR A TIME BUT THERE IT REMAINED LIKE THE PICTURE OF A CAMERA OBSCURA
I DID NOT MEAN ANYTHING UPON MY HONOUR TAMAR THAT COULD ANNOY YOU I ONLY MEANT YOU USED NOT TO BE A FOOL AND PRAY DON'T BEGIN NOW FOR I ASSURE YOU RADIE AND I WOULD NOT ASK IT IF IT COULD BE AVOIDED
LANGUID AND DEJECTED OTHERS SET HIM DOWN AS A GENTLEMAN IN DIFFICULTIES OF SOME SORT WHO WAS USING GYLINGDEN FOR A TEMPORARY REFUGE OTHERS AGAIN SUPPOSED HE MIGHT BE THAT MAJOR CRADDOCK
I WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL SO SOLITARY HE PLACED HIMSELF BESIDE MISS LAKE I'VE HAD SUCH A LONG WALK ACROSS THE PARK HOW DO YOU DO LAKE WHEN DID YOU COME AND SO ON LAKE ANSWERING AND LOOKING WONDERFULLY AS USUAL
ABOUT FOUR DAYS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THE DESPATCHES TO WHICH THE CONFERENCE OF CAPTAIN LAKE AND THE ATTORNEY REFERRED THERE CAME A LETTER FROM THE SAME PROLIFIC CORRESPONDENT DATED TWENTIETH MARCH FROM GENOA WHICH ALTOGETHER PUZZLED MISTER LARKIN
AND COMMITTED WASTE BESIDE IN TIMBER HE HAD NO RIGHT TO IN LIFE AS I AM TOLD BUT THAT DON'T SIGNIFY MUCH ONLY THE HOUSE WILL COST ME A PRETTY PENNY TO GET IT INTO ORDER AND FURNISH THE RENTAL IS FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR AND SOME HUNDREDS AND THE RENTS CAN BE GOT UP A BIT SO LARKIN TELLS ME
AN ADMIRER PERHAPS CERTAINLY NO WORSHIPPER YET I CAN'T SAY PERHAPS I DO WORSHIP BUT IF SO IT IS A WORSHIP STRANGELY MIXED WITH CONTEMPT AND SHE LAUGHED A LITTLE
THE VIBRATIONS OF ANOTHER SORT OF FLURRY CERTAINLY WITHIN A WEEK HE WRITES DOES HE MEAN HE'LL BE HERE IN A WEEK OR ONLY TO HAVE THE PAPERS READY IN A WEEK ASKED LAKE THE QUESTION CERTAINLY DOES ARISE IT STRUCK ME ON THE FIRST
A TRUE ALLEGORY I MEAN TAMAR DEATH WILL CLOSE THE EYES AND EARS AGAINST THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF EARTH BUT EVEN THE TOMB SECURES NO SECRECY THE DEAD THEMSELVES DECLARE THEIR DREADFUL SECRETS OPEN MOUTHED TO THE WINDS
THE YOUNG LADY HAD PEREMPTORILY MADE UP HER MIND TO DANCE NO MORE THAT NIGHT HOW CAN DORCAS ENDURE THAT MAN THOUGHT RACHEL
AND THAT BEYOND THIS HE WAS AS ABSOLUTELY IN THE DARK AS SHE OR CHELFORD WHAT THEN DID RACHEL MEAN BY ALL THAT ESCAPED HER WHEN HE WAS IN DANGER HOW THE COULD HE TELL
I REALLY AM BUSY AND IT IS TOO BAD TO HAVE ONE'S TIME WASTED IN SOLEMN LECTURES ABOUT STUFF AND NONSENSE DO MAKE RACHEL EXPLAIN HERSELF IF SHE CAN I HAVE NO OBJECTION I ASSURE YOU
AND BESOUGHT THE PRIEST WHEN SHE WAS DYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE HER LAID IN THE ABBEY VAULT WITH HER MOUTH OPEN AND HER EYES AND EARS SEALED IN TOKEN THAT HER TERM OF SLAVERY WAS OVER THAT HER LIPS MIGHT NOW BE OPEN
WHO BROUGHT IN HER TINY TEA EQUIPAGE IT SEEMED AS IF THE SHADOW OF THE DELL INTO WHICH SHE HAD BEEN VACANTLY GAZING STILL RESTED ON HER FACE NOT HERE TAMAR I'LL DRINK TEA IN MY ROOM AND YOU MUST BRING YOUR TEA CUP TOO AND WE'LL TAKE IT TOGETHER
THEN THERE WAS THAT BEAUTIFUL APATHETIC DORCAS BRANDON WHERE IS THE LAGGARD SO DULL AS TO EXPERIENCE NO PLEASING FLUTTER AT HIS HEART IN ANTICIPATION OF MEETING A PERFECT BEAUTY IN A COUNTRY HOUSE
IT MAY BE SAFELY CONTRACTED SOLELY TO JOIN TWO ESTATES PURSUED THE YOUNG LADY DO I THINK IT MAY SAFELY BE CONTRACTED SOLELY TO JOIN TWO ESTATES REPEATED THE OLD LADY WITH A LOOK AND CARRIAGE THAT PLAINLY SHOWED
AT DISADVANTAGE AND REMARKED THAT SOME OF MISTER LARKIN'S CLIENTS LOOKED ALWAYS UNHAPPY THOUGH THEY HAD SO GODLY AN ATTORNEY TO DEAL WITH WHEN LAKE WITH A LITTLE SHUDDER FOR IT WAS GROWING CHILL
SHE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT HOLDING HER BOUQUET DROOPING TOWARDS THE FLOOR AND LOOKING WITH HER CLOUDED EYES DOWN DOWN THROUGH IT AND THEN SHE LOOKED UP SUDDENLY WITH AN ODD FIERCE SMILE AND SHE SAID BITTERLY ENOUGH
BOOT BEATING TIME TO THE MUSIC OF HIS THOUGHTS SEVERAL GROUPS PASSED CLOSE BY HIM IN THEIR PLEASANT CIRCUIT SOME WONDERED WHAT MIGHT BE THE DISEASE OF THAT PALE PEEVISH LOOKING GENTLEMAN WHO SAT THERE SO STILL
THAT IS IF I SLIP MY CABLE FIRST LARKIN TOLD ME THIS AND I TOOK AN OPINION AND FOUND IT IS SO
MISS LAKE DON'T YOU POOR MISTER BUTTLE DID NOT KNOW LORD CHELFORD
MY EYES WANDERED OVER THEM ALL WITH THAT STRANGE SENSE OF UNREALITY AND THAT MINGLING OF SWEET AND BITTER FANCY WITH WHICH WE REVISIT A SCENE FAMILIAR IN VERY REMOTE AND EARLY CHILDHOOD AND WHICH HAS HAUNTED A LONG INTERVAL OF MATURITY AND ABSENCE
PATSY LAUGHED SHE FELT WONDERFULLY RELIEVED WASN'T I THE GRAND LADY THOUGH WITH ALL THE FORTUNE I NEVER HAD SHE CRIED MERRILY BUT TWAS REALLY FINE TO BE RICH FOR A DAY AND TOSS THE MONEY AROUND AS IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO DRESS TEN HEADS OF HAIR IN TEN HOURS TO EARN MY BREAD AND BUTTER
MOREOVER MISTER MARVIN INTRODUCED HIM TO SEVERAL SUBSTANTIAL GENTLEMEN AS MISTER JOHN MERRICK OF PORTLAND AND EACH ONE BOWED PROFOUNDLY AND DECLARED HE WAS HIGHLY HONORED YET UNCLE JOHN SEEMED IN NO WAY ELATED BY THIS RECEPTION
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE PATSY ADOPTS AN UNCLE UNCLE JOHN AND MISTER WATSON DID NOT APPEAR AT DINNER BEING CLOSETED IN THE FORMER'S ROOM
THE GIRL YAWNED AND TOOK UP HER NEGLECTED NOVEL NEVERTHELESS MATER DEAR SHE SAID BRIEFLY
AND WAS SO GENTLE AND UNOBSTRUSIVE THAT AUNT JANE LOOKED AT HIM WITH SURPRISE
AND PROPPED AND SUPPORTED BY A DOZEN EMBROIDERED CUSHIONS
TO PASS THE TIME HE TURNED INTO A SMALL RESTAURANT AND HAD COFFEE AND A PLATE OF CAKES IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT PATSY HAD SO RECENTLY PREPARED COFFEE OVER THE SHEET IRON STOVE AND BROUGHT SOME HOT BUNS FROM A NEAR BY BAKERY HE WAS NOT ESPECIALLY HUNGRY BUT IN SIPPING THE COFFEE AND NIBBLING THE CAKES
AND SELECTED THE NIECE I PREFER TO BECOME MY HEIRESS YOU CANNOT ACCUSE OF INJUSTICE BECAUSE NONE OF YOU HAD A RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING OF ME BUT I WILL SAY THIS THAT I AM WELL PLEASED WITH ALL THREE OF YOU
THE INVALID'S FACE SEEMED DRAWN AND GRAY AND SHE LAY UPON HER CUSHIONS BREATHING HEAVILY AND WITHOUT ANY APPEARANCE OF VITALITY OR STRENGTH EVEN THE SHARPNESS AND PIERCING QUALITY OF HER HARD GRAY EYES WAS LACKING
WAS MADE SUBSEQUENT TO THE ONE UNDER WHICH JANE MERRICK INHERITED AND THEREFORE SUPERCEDES IT
AND THE SUBSEQUENT FINDING OF THE WILL
A COARSE AND DISAGREEABLE CREATURE WHO MARRIED A MUSIC TEACHER AND SETTLED IN SOME OUT OF THE WAY COUNTRY TOWN ONCE WHILE YOUR FATHER WAS ALIVE SHE VISITED US FOR A FEW DAYS WITH HER BABY DAUGHTER AND NEARLY DROVE US ALL CRAZY
SHE COULD NOT HELP IT THE SIGHT WAS TOO RIDICULOUS A MOMENT LATER PATSY WAS LAUGHING TOO AND THEN AUNT JANE ALLOWED A GRIM SMILE TO CROSS HER FEATURES NEVER MIND LOUISE SHE SAID WITH REMARKABLE CHEERFULNESS WE'LL COMPROMISE MATTERS HOW ASKED PATSY
THE WOMAN FLEW ANGRY IN AN INSTANT WHO GAVE YOU SUCH AUTHORITY SHE DEMANDED NO ONE I JUST TOOK IT SAID PATSY SAUCILY HE SHALL NOT COME DECLARED AUNT JANE STERNLY I'LL HAVE NO INTERFERENCE FROM YOU MISS
THE BALANCE OF POWER SEEMED TO BE IN PATRICIA'S HANDS HOWEVER
SHAKING HIS LITTLE ROUND BODY AS IF HE HAD MET WITH THE MOST AMUSING THING THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED IN HIS LIFE AUNT JANE STARED AT HIM WHILE LOUISE AND BETH LOOKED THEIR ASTONISHMENT BUT PATSY'S CLEAR LAUGHTER RANG ABOVE UNCLE JOHN'S GASPING CHUCKLES
AND THEN SHE WENT TO BED AND SLEPT PEACEFULLY
IT'S ALL I'LL EVER GET IT SEEMS AND THEN THE THOUGHT OF THE PROFESSOR AND HIS DEBTS OVERCAME HER AND SHE BURST INTO TEARS THE BOY SAT DOUBLED WITHIN HIS CHAIR SO OVERCOME BY THE EXTRAORDINARY FORTUNE THAT HAD OVERTAKEN HIM THAT HE COULD NOT SPEAK
THE LATTER OF WHOM WAS OFTEN PRESENT AT THE STATE DINNER AND BOTH MEN CONGRATULATED PATSY UPON THE DISTINCT VICTORY SHE HAD WON NO MORE WAS SAID ABOUT HER LEAVING ELMHURST THE MAJOR WROTE THAT HE WAS HAVING A SPLENDID TIME WITH THE COLONEL AND BEGGED FOR AN EXTENSION OF HIS VACATION
IT'S NO PALACE SAID PATSY ENTERING TO THROW DOWN THE BUNDLES AS SOON AS THE MAJOR UNLOCKED THE DOOR BUT THERE'S A CRICKET IN THE HEARTH AND IT'S YOUR HOME UNCLE JOHN AS WELL AS OURS UNCLE JOHN LOOKED AROUND CURIOUSLY
THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY JANE DECLARED THE LAWYER IMPRESSIVELY WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE IN OUR INVESTMENTS AND YOU HAVE USED BUT LITTLE OF YOUR AMPLE INCOME TO SPARE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO KENNETH WHO IS TOM'S SOLE REMAINING RELATIVE WOULD BE NO HARDSHIP TO PATRICIA
THERE'LL BE NO GRUDGE OF MINE TO FOLLOW YOU TO THE GRAVE AUNT JANE BUT HER VOICE HARDENING I'LL NEVER TOUCH A PENNY OF THE MONEY THAT WAS DENIED MY POOR DEAD MOTHER THANK GOD THE OLD DAD AND I ARE INDEPENDENT AND CAN EARN OUR OWN LIVING
AND WE SLEEP TILL EIGHT O'CLOCK DON'T WE PATSY ASKED THE MAJOR OF COURSE AND THE EGGS FOR BREAKFAST I'VE BOUGHT THEM ALREADY THREE FOR A NICKLE YOU DON'T CARE FOR MORE THAN ONE DO YOU UNCLE JOHN NO MY DEAR
ALWAYS I WOULD THINK THAT IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN HARD AND MISERLY THIS SAME MONEY WOULD HAVE SAVED MY MOTHER'S LIFE NO I LOATHE YOUR MONEY KEEP IT OR THROW IT TO THE DOGS IF YOU WON'T GIVE IT TO THE BOY IT BELONGS TO
AUNT JANE TURNED TO HER BROTHER I HAVE ALSO PROVIDED FOR YOU JOHN IN THE SUM OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS
AND PASSED THE MORNING MOST ENJOYABLY IN HER SUNSHINEY GARDEN HERE PATRICIA WAS ALSO BROUGHT IN HER WHEEL CHAIR BY BETH WHO THEN LEFT THE TWO INVALIDS TOGETHER THEY CONVERSED GENIALLY ENOUGH FOR A TIME UNTIL AN UNFORTUNATE REMARK OF AUNT JANE'S
HER NATURAL CUNNING AND DETERMINATION TO HAVE HER OWN WAY ENHANCED BY HER ILLNESS THE WOMAN DECIDED TO DECEIVE PATRICIA AND ENJOY HER FEW REMAINING DAYS IN PEACE SUPPOSE SHE SAID TO MISTER WATSON
JANE WAS RICH HAVING INHERITED A FORTUNE AND A HANDSOME COUNTRY PLACE FROM A YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE WAS ENGAGED TO MARRY BUT WHO DIED ON THE EVE OF HIS WEDDING DAY HOW ROMANTIC EXCLAIMED LOUISE
BRILLIANT OF COURSE THE IDEA WAS BRILLIANT MAMMA THE INCOME OF THAT INSURANCE MONEY WAS INSIGNIFICANT BUT THE CAPITAL IS A VERY RESPECTABLE SUM I AM JUST SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE
PRONOUNCED WONDERFULLY FINE OF COURSE THE BOY BLUSHED WITH PLEASURE AND WAS ENCOURAGED TO STILL GREATER EFFORT THE GIRL WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR KENNETH'S SUDDEN ADVANCEMENT IN THE HOUSEHOLD AT ELMHURST ONE DAY SHE SAID CALMLY TO AUNT JANE I'VE INVITED KENNETH TO DINNER THIS EVENING
THERE'S DANNY REEVES'S RESTAURANT LET'S GET OFF AND HAVE OUR DINNER NOW I'M AS HUNGRY AS A BEAR SO THEY STOPPED THE CAR AND DESCENDED LUGGING ALL THE PARCELS INTO THE LITTLE RESTAURANT WHERE THEY WERE PILED INTO A CHAIR WHILE THE PROPRIETOR AND THE WAITERS ALL GATHERED AROUND PATSY TO WELCOME HER HOME
NOT AT ALL DADDY THEN DON'T MIND IT CHILD LIKE AS NOT THE MONEY WOULD BE THE RUINATION OF US ALL EH SIR APPEALING TO UNCLE JOHN
AFTER THAT IT BECAME THE DAILY PROGRAM FOR PATSY TO SPEND HER MORNINGS IN AUNT JANE'S LITTLE GARDEN AND ALTHOUGH THEY SOMETIMES CLASHED AND AS PHIBBS TOLD BETH HAD DREADFUL FIGHTS THEY BOTH ENJOYED THESE HOURS VERY MUCH
IT DOES SEEM ROMANTIC RELATED IN THIS WAY REPLIED HER MOTHER
SAID THE OLD WOMAN WITH A SIGH OF INTENSE RELIEF I CAN DIE IN PEACE
THEY'D MISSED ME AT THE OFFICE AND WERE GLAD TO HAVE ME BACK
SAID LOUISE MUSINGLY THEN THIS RICH AUNT JANE HAS ANOTHER NIECE BESIDES MYSELF PERHAPS TWO RETURNED MISSUS MERRICK FOR HER YOUNGEST SISTER WHO WAS NAMED VIOLET
BUT HE HAD BY NO MEANS UNDERSTOOD HER PRESENT OBJECT NOR DID SHE MEAN THAT HE SHOULD SO SHE ANSWERED HIS QUESTIONING LOOK BY SAYING I HAVE PROMISED PATRICIA THAT YOU SHALL DRAW A NEW WILL LEAVING ALL MY ESTATE TO KENNETH FORBES
BUT ARE WE NOT DIPLOMATS MOTHER DEAR
THE ROOM WAS TASTEFULLY THOUGH SOMEWHAT ELABORATELY FURNISHED YET EVERYTHING IN IT SEEMED AS FRESH AND NEW AS IF IT HAD JUST COME FROM THE SHOP WHICH WAS NOT FAR FROM THE TRUTH THE APARTMENT ITSELF WAS NEW
BUT MAY I ENQUIRE WHERE ON EARTH YOU EXPECT TO STOW ME IN THIS RATHER LIMITED ESTABLISHMENT WHERE HAVE YOU NO EYES THEN SHE ASKED IN ASTONISHMENT IT'S THE FINEST SOFA IN THE WORLD UNCLE JOHN AND YOU'LL SLEEP THERE LIKE A TOP
AS A MATTER OF JUSTICE THE PLACE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN YOURS AND I WON'T ACCEPT A DOLLAR OF THE MONEY IF I STARVE TO DEATH THINK OF YOUR FATHER SUGGESTED AUNT JANE CUNNINGLY AH I'VE DONE THAT SAID THE GIRL
HE SMOKES OBSERVED THE MAJOR SIGNIFICANTLY BAH A PIPE SAID PATSY AND BULL DURHAM IS ONLY FIVE CENTS A BAG AND A BAG OUGHT TO LAST A WEEK AND EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT SIR
BUT NOW SHE SEEMED DELIGHTED TO HAVE PATSY FLY AT HER AND EXCUSED THE GIRL'S TEMPER INSTEAD OF RESENTING IT BUT PATSY WAS A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HERSELF THIS MORNING REALIZING PERHAPS THAT AUNT JANE HAD BEEN TRYING TO VEX HER JUST TO ENJOY HER INDIGNANT SPEECHES
GOOD GRACIOUS SHE CRIED DELIGHTEDLY ALL THIS WEALTH AND YOU PLEADING POVERTY I NEVER SAID I WAS A PAUPER RETURNED UNCLE JOHN COMPLACENTLY YOU COULDN'T AND BE TRUTHFUL SIR DECLARED THE GIRL WHY THIS WILL LAST FOR AGES
THE GIRL CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM OUTSIDE THE GATES HIS FACE RED AND BEAMING AS A POPPY IN BLOOM AND HIS SNOWY MOUSTACHE BRISTLING WITH EAGERNESS AT ONCE SHE DROPPED HER BUNDLES AND FLEW TO THE MAJOR'S ARMS

YOU OUGHT TO BE ONE OF THE HAPPIEST MEN IN THE WORLD AND YOU LOOK LIKE A DEATH'S HEAD THE HAPPIEST MAN IN THE WORLD HE REPEATED
SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND A WOMAN'S SOFT AND DELICATE FINGERS YET CLASPING HIS WITH AN ALMOST VIRILE STRENGTH AND FRIENDLINESS SHE LEFT HIM WITH JUST THAT FEELING ABOUT HER THAT SHE WAS EXPANSIVE IN HER HEART HER SYMPATHIES
THE ENVELOPE OF THE LETTER HE OPENED WITH A LITTLE MORE COMPUNCTION IT WAS WRITTEN ON THE PRINTED NOTEPAPER OF THE DOUGLAS ROMILLY SHOE COMPANY AND WAS OF NO GREAT LENGTH DEAR MISTER ROMILLY
HER LIPS SOUGHT HIS IN VAIN HE PUSHED HER AWAY
I SUPPOSE BECAUSE IN MY SOLITUDE THOUGHTS OF MY OWN WEAKNESS TAUNTED ME WEAKNESS BECAUSE I COULDN'T BREAK OUT I MEAN PERHAPS FOR THAT REASON THE THOUGHT OF A STRONG WOMAN FASCINATED ME A WOMAN LARGE IN THOUGHTS AND WAYS A WOMAN TO WHOM PURPOSES AND TENDENCIES COUNTED MOST
I THINK SHE SAID THAT YOU MUST HAVE BEEN VERY MISERABLE ABOVE ALL THINGS NOW WHATEVER YOU MAY HAVE DONE FOR YOUR LIBERTY DON'T BE FAINTHEARTED IF YOU ARE IN TROUBLE OR DANGER YOU MUST COME TO ME YOU PROMISE IF I MAY
AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE WENT ON PENSIVELY I AM RATHER PROUD OF MY FIGURE A LITTLE JOURNALIST WHO HAD ANNOYED ME AND TO WHOM I WAS RUDE ONCE CALLED IT AMPLE
YOU COULDN'T LOATHE ME COULD YOU SHE BEGGED THE THOUGHT OF THOSE LONG DAYS WE SPENT TOGETHER IN OUR PRISON HOUSE WOULD RISE UP AND FORBID IT KISS ME
IF WE MEET ON THE OTHER SIDE MISTER LAWTON WE'LL COMPARE NOTES AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE THAT'S ALL RIGHT SIR THE OTHER AGREED I DON'T KNOW AS YOU'RE NOT RIGHT WE AMERICANS DO HANG ROUND OUR BUSINESSES AND THAT'S A FACT
I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN BUSINESS HE ANSWERED QUICKLY MY NAME IS ROMILLY BUT I AM NOT ROMILLY THE MANUFACTURER FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS I HAVE LIVED IN A GARRET IN LONDON TEACHING FALSE ART IN A THIRD RATE SCHOOL SOME OF THE TIME
AT THE FAR END OF THE SHIP SHE CLUNG TO HIM ONCE OR TWICE AS THE WIND CAME BOOMING OVER THE FRESHENING WAVES SHE WEIGHED AND MEASURED HIS CRITICISMS OF THE PLAYS THEY SPOKE OF AND IN THE MAIN APPROVED OF THEM
SHE WENT ON RUMINATINGLY THE HOTEL WHERE MISTER DANE SENT ME IT'S NICE ENOUGH IN ITS WAY BUT VERY STUFFY AS REGARDS THE PEOPLE IS TWICE AS EXPENSIVE AS IT WOULD BE IN LONDON HOWEVER WE SHALL SEE
OR TO LIE ABOUT IN HIS STEAMER CHAIR AND LISTEN WITH HALF CLOSED EYES
AS YOU DID ONCE YOU KNOW HE DID HIS BEST TO BE RESPONSIVE
THE TOUCH OF HER FINGERS WAS WONDERFUL COOL AND SOFT AND SOMEHOW REASSURING HE FELT A SENSE OF RELAXATION FELT THE STRAIN OF LIVING SUDDENLY GROW LESS YOU KNOW SHE SAID
I AM AFRAID HE OBSERVED THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A TERRIBLY HARD COUNTRY TO DISAPPEAR IN DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT SHE REPLIED CHEERFULLY YOU ARRIVE HERE TO DAY AND YOU ARE IN REQUEST EVERYWHERE TO MORROW YOU ARE FORGOTTEN SOME ONE ELSE ARRIVES
YOU DEAR DEAR MAN SHE EXCLAIMED TO THINK WHAT YOU HAVE MISSED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE EVENING OF YOUR LIFE IT'S A SUCCESS DO YOU HEAR A GREAT SUCCESS IT WAS WONDERFUL
DROVE EVERY THOUGHT OF FUTURE DANGER OUT OF HIS MIND HE HAD AT LEAST THE PRESENT HE ANSWERED WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE
HE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO THEY ARE WHERE I SHALL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN SHE REPEATED PUZZLED I MEAN THAT I HAVE LEFT THEM AT HOME I HAVE LEFT THEM THERE PERHAPS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT DELIBERATELY HE WENT ON
AND THEN AS THE TIME PASSED ON WELL YOU CAME TO BE MY ONLY SOLACE AGAINST THE WRETCHEDNESS OF THAT LIFE SHE NODDED APPRECIATIVELY
THEN WE WILL TALK I WANT MORE THAN JUST THAT MONEY I AM LONELY AND DO YOU KNOW PHILIP I BELIEVE THAT I MUST HAVE CARED FOR YOU ALL THE TIME
SHE GAVE THE CHAUFFEUR A WHISPERED ORDER AS SHE STEPPED INTO THE CAR I HAVE TOLD HIM TO GO HOME BY RIVERSIDE DRIVE SHE SAID AS THEY GLIDED OFF IT IS A LITTLE FARTHER
HE DID NOT EVEN ASK THE ONE NATURAL QUESTION
I DON'T WANT THEM TO NOTICE ME PHILIP SHE MURMURED I WANT YOU TO LOOK JUST FOR A MOMENT AS THOUGH YOU THOUGHT ME THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD
I HAVE DISCOVERED A NEW DRAMATIST AND I AM GOING TO PRODUCE A PLAY OF HIS WITHIN THREE MONTHS I HOPE I SHAN'T TELL YOU HIS NAME AND I SHAN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ABOUT THE PLAY EXCEPT THAT I FIND MORE PROMISE IN IT THAN ANYTHING I HAVE SEEN OR READ FOR MONTHS
I HAVE LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THE LAST FEW DAYS BUT THEN WE KNEW ALL THE TIME DIDN'T WE THAT IT WAS JUST AN INTERLUDE THE THINGS WHICH LIE BEFORE US ARE SO FULL OF INTEREST IT IS THE NEXT FEW HOURS WHICH I FEAR HE MUTTERED GLOOMILY SHE LAUGHED AT HIM FOOLISH
SHE ASKED HER VOICE STILL VERY LOW WHY I LEFT THE SALOON A LITTLE ABRUPTLY THIS EVENING WHY HE DEMANDED BECAUSE SHE WENT ON I COULD SEE THE EFFECT WHICH MISTER RAYMOND GREENE'S STORY HAD UPON YOU BECAUSE I ALSO WAS IN THAT TRAIN
THEY CAME BACK TO HIM WITH A CURIOUS SENSE OF UNREALITY THEY BELONGED SURETY TO SOME OTHER MAN LIVING IN SOME OTHER WORLD YOU ARE HAPPY ELIZABETH MURMURED
BUT IT WAS ALL SO HOPELESS WASN'T IT YOU COULD BARELY KEEP YOURSELF FROM STARVING AND I OH THE MISERY OF THAT AWFUL DETTON MAGNA AND TEACHING THOSE WRETCHED CHILDREN
AND I HOPE IT'S ONLY THE FIRST OF MANY YOU ARE VERY KIND PHILIP MURMURED CORDIALLY ELIZABETH GLANCED AROUND THE LITTLE GROUP DEAR ME I AM FORGETTING MY MANNERS SHE DECLARED
SHE LAUGHED AT HIS EMBARRASSMENT AFFECTING TO IGNORE THE FACT THAT IT WAS LESS THE AUTHOR'S MODESTY THAN SOME QUEER IMPULSE OF HORROR
ACCEPTING BATTLE WILLING TO FIGHT WHATEVER MIGHT COME FOR THE SAKE OF THE JOY OF THESE MOMENTS
YOU CAN CALL UPON HIM AT HIS HOTEL IF YOU LIKE THE WALDORF HE IS GOING TO I BELIEVE AND I AM SURE HE WILL TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT'S ALL RIGHT MISS DALSTAN THE YOUNG MAN DECLARED SOOTHINGLY
SURE YOU WON'T JOIN US LAWTON DAREN'T WAS THE LACONIC ANSWER FROM THE MAN WHOM HE HAD ADDRESSED BY THE BYE MISTER RAYMOND GREENE WENT ON LET ME MAKE YOU TWO ACQUAINTED THIS IS MISTER DOUGLAS ROMILLY AN ENGLISH BOOT MANUFACTURER
THERE WAS A NEW BUT PLEASANT CHILL IN THE FROSTY SUNLIT AIR THE GREAT BUILDINGS OF NEW YORK AT WHICH HE HAD BEEN GAZING FOR HOURS WERE STANDING HETEROGENEOUS BUT MAGNIFICENT CLEAR CUT AGAINST AN AZURE SKY THE FERRY BOATS
A DIFFICULT BUSINESS HE ASSURED HER
AFTER SEVERAL WOULD BE INGRATIATING GIGGLES THEY FINALLY PULLED UP IN FRONT OF HIM WHILST HE WAS PROMENADING THE DECK YOU ARE MISTER ROMILLY AREN'T YOU ONE OF THEM ASKED BOB MILLET TOLD US YOU WERE GOING TO BE ON THIS STEAMER YOU KNOW BOB DON'T YOU
YOU WANT ME TO MARRY YOU HE DEMANDED SIMPLY MARRY YOU
THEN HE REPLACED IT A LITTLE DAZED DOUGLAS HAD PLANNED TO LEAVE ENGLAND THEN WITH THIS CRISIS LOOMING OVER HIM WHY PHILIP FOR A MOMENT SAT DOWN ON THE ARM OF AN EASY CHAIR A GRIM SENSE OF HUMOUR SUDDENLY PARTED HIS LIPS HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD AND LAUGHED
THE WRETCHED SURROUNDINGS THE ODORIFEROUS FOOD THE THICK CROCKERY THE SMOKE PALLED VISTA OF ROOFS AND CHIMNEYS THE GENIUS OF A STEVENSON WOULD HAVE BECOME DWARFED IN SUCH SURROUNDINGS A PHRASE A HAPPY IDEA SUDDENLY CAUGHT HIS FANCY
SHE SHOOK HER HEAD I'D RATHER NOT SHE ADMITTED MY BRAIN IS TOO FULL I HAVE A HUNDRED FANCIES DANCING ABOUT I EVEN FIND MYSELF AS WE SIT HERE REHEARSING MY GESTURES TUNING MYSELF TO A NEW OUTLOOK
GEE HE'D GIVE SOMETHING TO BE WITH US TO NIGHT YOU'LL AGREE WITH ME MISS DALSTAN I KNOW LET'S EMPTY A FULL GLASS TO SYLVANUS POWER THERE WAS A CURIOUS SILENCE FOR A SECOND OR TWO
A MORE EXTENSIVE CANVAS A MORE SPLENDID A RIPER AND RICHER VOCABULARY NOTHING THAT I HAVE EVER DONE HE SIGHED IS WORTH TALKING TO YOU ABOUT BUT IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE MY FRIEND WELL
IS IT YOUR VOICE I WONDER THAT IS SO SOOTHING OR JUST WHAT YOU SAY SHE SMILED REASSURINGLY YOU ARE GLAD BECAUSE YOU HAVE FOUND A FRIEND SHE TOLD HIM AND A FRIEND WHO EVEN IF SHE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND DOES NOT WISH TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT WOULD HE DO WHAT WOULD HE SAY WHAT BRETON SAT DOWN QUIETLY AT HIS DESK AND LOOKED SPARGO HARD BETWEEN THE EYES PROVE THAT TO ME SPARGO HE SAID IN HARD MATTER OF FACT TONES
REPLIED MYERST AND I WAS GLAD TO TAKE IT AND NATURALLY I GAINED A CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF HIM HE HAD ONLY ONE FRIEND MISTER ELPHICK IN THERE NOW
SOON AFTER SEVEN MISTER ELPHICK SAID THEY WERE GOING TO PARIS AND THEY'D BREAKFAST AT CHARING CROSS BEFORE THE TRAIN LEFT SAY WHEN THEY'D BE BACK ASKED BRETON WITH AN ASSUMPTION OF ENTIRE CARELESSNESS NO SIR MISTER ELPHICK DIDN'T ANSWERED THE PORTER
WHICH SPARGO PRESENTLY SET BEFORE HIM HE LAUGHED AS HE INHALED THE FIRST FUMES OF HIS CIGAR AS IT HAPPENS YOU'LL HEAR NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH HE OBSERVED NOW THAT THINGS ARE AS THEY ARE
THERE'S NO REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T TELL THE TRUTH THE FACT IS I'VE NOTHING TO FEAR YOU CAN'T GIVE ME IN CHARGE FOR IT SO HAPPENS THAT I'VE GOT A POWER OF ATTORNEY
ALL STORIES ARE QUITE PLAIN WHEN THEY COME OUT
MISTER ELPHICK LAUGHED SLIGHTLY AND WAVED HIS HAND MY GOOD YOUNG GENTLEMAN HE SAID YOU EXAGGERATE YOUR OWN IMPORTANCE
A DOCTOR OF NO REPUTATION AND MYSELF WE CARRIED IT OUT VERY CLEVERLY AND CHAMBERLAYNE GAVE US FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS APIECE FOR OUR TROUBLE IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAD HELPED HIM
WE HAVE TO BE UP AT DAYBREAK AND POSSIBLY YOU TOO WOULD LIKE TO BE UP JUST AS EARLY MISTER QUARTERPAGE LOOKED AN ENQUIRY OVER THE TOP OF A DECANTER WHICH HE WAS HANDLING AT DAYBREAK HE EXCLAIMED THE FACT IS SAID SPARGO THAT GRAVE OF CHAMBERLAYNE'S IS GOING TO BE OPENED AT DAYBREAK
WHOSE NERVOUSNESS WAS PAINFULLY APPARENT TO EVERYBODY AND DEEPLY FELT BY HIMSELF HE HALTED ON THE THRESHOLD LOOKING ROUND THE COMFORTABLY FURNISHED ROOM AND AT THE TWO WELL DRESSED YOUNG MEN
THEY COULD ALL READ THE LETTERING ON IT JAMES CARTWRIGHT CHAMBERLAYNE BORN EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO DIED EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE SPARGO TURNED AWAY AS THE MEN BEGAN TO LIFT THE COFFIN OUT OF THE GRAVE WE SHALL KNOW NOW HE WHISPERED TO BRETON AND YET
ELPHICK BEGAN TO MOVE IN HIS CORNER MUST THE POLICE COME HE SAID MUST THE POLICE MUST COME ANSWERED BRETON FIRMLY GO AHEAD WITH YOUR WIRE SPARGO WHILE I WRITE THIS NOTE
NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM BUT THAT THE TWO SHOULD GO IN HIS FAMILY HE SAID HAD JUST RETIRED BUT HE HIMSELF WAS GOING TO TAKE A FINAL NIGHTCAP AND A CIGAR AND THEY MUST SHARE IT FOR A FEW MINUTES ONLY THEN MISTER QUARTERPAGE SAID SPARGO AS THEY FOLLOWED THE OLD MAN INTO HIS DINING ROOM
AND IF YOU LOOK AT IT BRETON YOU'LL SEE IT'S IN ORDER
WELL AS I SAY I THOUGHT A CONSIDERABLE LOT
WE ARE GLAD TO MEET YOU SO UNEXPECTEDLY AND I MUST TROUBLE YOU TO PUT UP YOUR HANDS QUICK MYERST MADE ONE HURRIED MOVEMENT OF HIS RIGHT HAND TOWARDS HIS HIP BUT A SUDDEN GROWL FROM BRETON MADE HIM SHIFT IT JUST AS QUICKLY ABOVE HIS HEAD
IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT IT WAS STILL VERY LITTLE PAST MIDSUMMER THERE WAS A CHEERY FIRE IN THE GRATE AND ON A TABLE SET NEAR A ROOMY ARM CHAIR WAS SET SUCH CREATURE COMFORTS AS A SPIRIT CASE A SYPHON A TUMBLER AND A NOVEL
YES HE MUTTERED BLACKMAIL THAT WAS IT BLACKMAIL HE HE GOT MONEY PAPERS FROM US THEY'RE ON HIM BRETON TURNED ON THE CAPTIVE WITH A LOOK OF CONTEMPT I THOUGHT AS MUCH MISTER MYERST HE SAID
LOOK HERE BRETON HE SAID WHISPERING
WE'VE BEEN CLEVER ENOUGH TO CATCH YOU ANYWAY RETORTED BRETON AND NOW WE'VE GOT YOU WE'LL KEEP YOU TILL THE POLICE CAN RELIEVE US OF YOU OH
HE LOOKED OVER THE BANISTERS DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW BENEATH AND THERE MARCHING UP RESOLUTELY
HE ASKED CAUSE IF THERE IS I AIN'T A GOING TO SAY A WORD NO NOT FOR NO THOUSAND POUNDS ME NEVER HAVING BEEN IN NO TROUBLE OF ANY SORT GUV'NOR
I WISH YOU'D TAKE THESE TWO OR THREE HEARTHRUGS SHE SAYS AND GIVE EM A GOOD BEATING SHE SAYS AND ME BEING ALWAYS A READY ONE TO OBLIGE
MISTER SPARGO MEANS WELL I AM SURE I AM CONVINCED
THEY HAVEN'T GONE TO PARIS THAT WAS ALL A BLIND FOR THE PRESENT LET'S GO BACK TO YOUR CHAMBERS THEN I'LL TALK TO YOU ONCE WITHIN BRETON'S INNER ROOM WITH THE DOOR CLOSED UPON THEM
HE IMPLORED I BEG YOU TO PROMISE ME THIS SPARGO HESITATED CONSIDERING MATTERS VERY WELL I PROMISE HE SAID AND YOU WON'T PRINT IT CONTINUED ELPHICK STILL CLINGING TO HIM SAY YOU WON'T PRINT IT TONIGHT
BUT BEFORE SPARGO COULD REPLY A LOUD INSISTENT KNOCKING CAME AT THE OUTER DOOR ELPHICK STARTED NERVOUSLY BUT PRESENTLY HE MOVED ACROSS THE ROOM WALKING AS IF HE HAD RECEIVED A BLOW AND OPENED THE DOOR A BOY'S VOICE PENETRATED INTO THE SITTING ROOM
WELL HE GROWLED MY DEAR YOUNG GENTLEMAN IMPLORED MISTER ELPHICK DON'T GO I'LL I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU IF
WHOM YOU KNOW AS NICHOLAS CARDLESTONE IS IN REALITY CHAMBERLAYNE THE STOCKBROKER OF MARKET MILCASTER WHOSE NAME WAS SO FREELY MENTIONED WHEN YOUR FATHER WAS TRIED THERE
HE GROANED AS HE SANK INTO HIS CHAIR AND THE HAND WITH WHICH HE POURED OUT A GLASS OF SPIRITS SHOOK THE GLASS RATTLED AGAINST HIS TEETH WHEN HE RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS
I HAVE BEEN EXPECTING YOU AT ANY TIME EVER SINCE YOU TOOK UP YOUR INVESTIGATION OF THE MARBURY AFFAIR IN SOME OF THE EARLIER STAGES OF WHICH YOU SAW ME YOU WILL REMEMBER AT THE MORTUARY
SPARGO ROSE FROM HIS SEAT WITHOUT AS MUCH AS A LOOK AT BRETON
THEN BRETON NODDED LET HIM TALK IF HE LIKES HE SAID WE'RE NOT BOUND TO BELIEVE HIM AND WE MAY HEAR SOMETHING THAT'S TRUE
SPARGO RAN QUICKLY TO THE OFFICE AND HURRIED UP TO HIS OWN ROOM AND THERE CALMLY SEATED IN AN EASY CHAIR
DEEPLY CONSCIOUS THAT HE WAS USHERING INTO SPARGO'S ROOM AN INDIVIDUAL WHO MIGHT SHORTLY CARRY AWAY A THOUSAND POUNDS OF GOOD WATCHMAN MONEY IN HIS POCKET OPENED THE DOOR AND INTRODUCED A SHY AND SELF CONSCIOUS YOUNG MAN
I FELT SURE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE MORE THAN A FEW HOURS BEFORE YOU WOULD COME TO ME WHY MISTER ELPHICK SHOULD YOU SUPPOSE THAT I SHOULD COME TO YOU AT ALL ASKED SPARGO NOW IN FULL POSSESSION OF HIS WITS
SPARGO LET'S SEE WHAT HE HAS ON HIM SPARGO BEGAN TO SEARCH THE PRISONER'S POCKETS HE LAID OUT EVERYTHING ON THE TABLE AS HE FOUND IT IT WAS PLAIN THAT MYERST HAD CONTEMPLATED SOME SORT OF FLIGHT OR A LONG LONG JOURNEY
THAN I KNOW OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN
ANSWERED MYERST WHEN I DID KNOW THEN I BEGAN TO PUT THINGS TOGETHER AND TO PURSUE MY OWN LINE INDEPENDENT OF EVERYBODY I TELL YOU I HAD ALL MAITLAND'S PAPERS AND POSSESSIONS
I SHALL NOT PRINT IT TONIGHT ANSWERED SPARGO THAT'S CERTAIN ELPHICK RELEASED HIS GRIP ON THE YOUNG MAN'S ARM COME AT ELEVEN TOMORROW MORNING HE SAID AND DREW BACK AND CLOSED THE DOOR
I KNOW THAT THE MAN MURDERED UNDER THE NAME OF JOHN MARBURY WAS WITHOUT DOUBT JOHN MAITLAND OF MARKET MILCASTER AND THAT RONALD BRETON IS HIS SON WHOM YOU TOOK FROM THAT WOMAN
AND FRIGHT CARDLESTONE STILL SAT IN HIS CORNER SHIVERING AND TREMBLING HE LOOKED INCAPABLE OF EXPLAINING ANYTHING ELPHICK WAS SCARCELY MORE FITTED TO SPEAK
AND HE'S NEVER GIVEN YOU ANY DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE OF ANY SORT TO PROVE THE TRUTH OF THAT STORY NEVER I NEVER QUESTIONED HIS STATEMENT WHY SHOULD I YOU NEVER REMEMBER ANYTHING OF YOUR CHILDHOOD
BUT MYERST LAUGHED AGAIN ALL VERY HIGH AND MIGHTY MISTER SPARGO OF THE WATCHMAN HE SNEERED YOU'RE ANOTHER OF THE COCK SURE LOT AND YOU'RE VERY CLEVER
WHICH THEY'VE PAINTED ON HIS ENTRY THE FIFTH OR SIXTH AS YOU GO DOWN MIDDLE TEMPLE LANE ANSWERED MOLLISON MISTER NICHOLAS CARDLESTONE FIRST FLOOR UP THE STAIRCASE
RONALD BRETON IS THE SON OF THE MURDERED MAN AND RONALD BRETON IS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO THE DAUGHTER OF THE MAN CHARGED WITH THE MURDER DO YOU HEAR THAT
PREMATURE ATTEMPTS TO DISPENSE WITH THE INDUCEMENTS OF PRIVATE INTEREST IN SOCIAL AFFAIRS WHILE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THEM HAS BEEN OR CAN BE PROVIDED
AND THE SUBSTANCE OF ALL THAT I FIND TO SAY HAS IN SOME MANNER HOWEVER IMPERFECT BEEN GOT UPON PAPER
INSTEAD OF DEPENDING AS IN SO GREAT A DEGREE IT NOW DOES ON THE ACCIDENT OF BIRTH WILL BE MADE BY CONCERT ON AN ACKNOWLEDGED PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE
WHAT I HAD ALWAYS BEFORE RECEIVED WITH INCREDULITY THAT THE HABIT OF ANALYSIS HAS A TENDENCY TO WEAR AWAY THE FEELINGS AS INDEED IT HAS WHEN NO OTHER MENTAL HABIT IS CULTIVATED
TO SPEAK FAMILIARLY A MERE MATTER OF FEELING THEY ARE THEREFORE I THOUGHT FAVOURABLE TO PRUDENCE AND CLEAR SIGHTEDNESS BUT A PERPETUAL WORM AT THE ROOT BOTH OF THE PASSIONS AND OF THE VIRTUES
AND THERE SEEMED NO POWER IN NATURE SUFFICIENT TO BEGIN THE FORMATION OF MY CHARACTER ANEW AND CREATE IN A MIND NOW IRRETRIEVABLY ANALYTIC
WHEN PERPETRATED BY THE INSTRUMENTS OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS ENGLISHMEN CAN HARDLY FIND TERMS SUFFICIENT TO EXPRESS THEIR ABHORRENCE AFTER A SHORT TIME HOWEVER AN INDIGNANT FEELING WAS ROUSED
A PROPOSAL FOR SETTLING THE LAND QUESTION BY GIVING TO THE EXISTING TENANTS A PERMANENT TENURE AT A FIXED RENT TO BE ASSESSED AFTER DUE INQUIRY BY THE STATE THE PAMPHLET WAS NOT POPULAR
IS THE ARRANGEMENT IF THAT IS BAD THE WHOLE THREAD ON WHICH THE IDEAS STRING THEMSELVES BECOMES TWISTED THOUGHTS PLACED IN A WRONG CONNECTION ARE NOT EXPOUNDED IN A MANNER THAT SUITS THE RIGHT
ON GROUND ON WHICH THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DEEMED UNASSAILABLE AND GAVE ITS OWN EXPLANATION FROM EXPERIENCE AND ASSOCIATION
BUT TO BE SHARED WITH THE SOCIETY THEY BELONG TO THE SOCIAL PROBLEM OF THE FUTURE WE CONSIDERED TO BE HOW TO UNITE THE GREATEST INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY OF ACTION WITH A COMMON OWNERSHIP IN THE RAW MATERIAL OF THE GLOBE
OR AT ALL EVENTS FOR PUBLIC AND SOCIAL PURPOSES AND NOT AS HITHERTO SOLELY FOR NARROWLY INTERESTED ONES BUT THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS HAS ALWAYS EXISTED IN MANKIND AND IS NOT NOR
WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN AND PUBLISHED SHORTLY BEFORE THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SESSION OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT THE LEADING FEATURES OF THE PAMPHLET WERE
BEING CONSIDERED ILL BRED AND THE NATIONAL DEFICIENCY IN LIVELINESS AND SOCIABILITY HAVING PREVENTED THE CULTIVATION OF THE ART OF TALKING AGREEABLY ON TRIFLES
THEY SHOWED A DETERMINATION TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT A MEETING IN THE PARK TO WHICH MANY OF THEM WOULD PROBABLY HAVE COME ARMED THE GOVERNMENT MADE MILITARY PREPARATIONS TO RESIST THE ATTEMPT
WHICH DOES NOT ADMIT OF A CONSECUTIVE HISTORY AND THE RESULTS OF WHICH IF REAL WILL BE BEST FOUND IN MY WRITINGS I SHALL THEREFORE GREATLY ABRIDGE THE CHRONICLE OF MY SUBSEQUENT YEARS
WE DREADED THE IGNORANCE AND ESPECIALLY THE SELFISHNESS AND BRUTALITY OF THE MASS BUT OUR IDEAL OF ULTIMATE IMPROVEMENT WENT FAR BEYOND DEMOCRACY
OR ANY POSSIBLE CANONS OF EVIDENCE CAN DO BY THEMSELVES TOWARDS
WERE IT NOT THAT WE OWE TO ANALYSIS OUR CLEAREST KNOWLEDGE OF THE PERMANENT SEQUENCES IN NATURE THE REAL CONNEXIONS BETWEEN THINGS NOT DEPENDENT ON OUR WILL AND FEELINGS NATURAL LAWS BY VIRTUE OF WHICH IN MANY CASES
THE STUPIDEST PARTY THEY GAINED NOTHING BY DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE PASSAGE WHICH UP TO THAT TIME HAD NOT EXCITED ANY NOTICE
MY PART WAS TO BRING IN BILLS ALREADY PREPARED AND TO SUSTAIN THE DISCUSSION OF THEM
PROVOKED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BY INJUSTICE AND EXAGGERATED BY RAGE AND PANIC
FULLY JUSTIFIED THE TIMELINESS OF THOSE MOVEMENTS AND HAVE MADE WHAT WAS UNDERTAKEN AS A MORAL AND SOCIAL DUTY A PERSONAL SUCCESS ANOTHER DUTY WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY INCUMBENT ON ME
WHICH APPEARED AS SUITABLE TO MY PURPOSE AS ANYTHING WHICH I COULD WRITE IN LIEU OF THEM I HAVE FOUND GREAT ADVANTAGES IN THIS SYSTEM OF DOUBLE REDACTION IT COMBINES BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MODE OF COMPOSITION
PARLIAMENT PASSED A POOR LAW FOR MAINTAINING THEM AS PAUPERS AND IF THE NATION HAS NOT SINCE FOUND ITSELF IN INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES FROM THE JOINT OPERATION OF THE OLD EVILS AND THE QUACK REMEDY
WE DID FEEL BOUND THAT OUR CONDUCT SHOULD BE SUCH AS IN NO DEGREE TO BRING DISCREDIT ON HER HUSBAND NOR THEREFORE ON HERSELF
WHETHER ADMITTING OF A COMPLETE REMEDY OR NOT INVOLVED IN THE FACT THAT SOME ARE BORN TO RICHES AND THE VAST MAJORITY TO POVERTY I THEN RECKONED CHIMERICAL
EIGHTEEN FIFTY JUST IN TIME FOR ME TO ANSWER HIM IN THE THIRD EDITION HOW THE BOOK CAME TO HAVE FOR A WORK OF THE KIND
MAY JUSTLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE PREPARATION WHICH WENT ON DURING THOSE YEARS AND WHICH PRODUCED BUT LITTLE VISIBLE EFFECT AT THE TIME BUT ALL QUESTIONS ON WHICH THERE ARE STRONG PRIVATE INTERESTS
ONE THING IS INSEPARABLE FROM ANOTHER IN FACT WHICH LAWS IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE CLEARLY PERCEIVED AND IMAGINATIVELY REALIZED CAUSE OUR IDEAS OF THINGS WHICH ARE ALWAYS JOINED TOGETHER IN NATURE
OF ANY REALLY HIGH CLASS OF INTELLECT MAKE THEIR CONTACT WITH IT SO SLIGHT AND AT SUCH LONG INTERVALS AS TO BE ALMOST CONSIDERED AS RETIRING FROM IT ALTOGETHER
AND A RUDDER BUT NO SAIL WITHOUT ANY REAL DESIRE FOR THE ENDS WHICH I HAD BEEN SO CAREFULLY FITTED OUT TO WORK FOR NO DELIGHT IN VIRTUE OR THE GENERAL GOOD
WHETHER THIS HAS BEEN DONE EFFECTUALLY IS STILL SUB JUDICE AND EVEN THEN TO DEPRIVE A MODE OF THOUGHT SO STRONGLY ROOTED IN HUMAN PREJUDICES AND PARTIALITIES OF ITS MERE SPECULATIVE SUPPORT
TO A PERSON OF ANY BUT A VERY COMMON ORDER IN THOUGHT OR FEELING SUCH SOCIETY UNLESS HE HAS PERSONAL OBJECTS TO SERVE BY IT MUST BE SUPREMELY UNATTRACTIVE AND MOST PEOPLE IN THE PRESENT DAY
THE FOUNTAINS OF VANITY AND AMBITION SEEMED TO HAVE DRIED UP WITHIN ME AS COMPLETELY AS THOSE OF BENEVOLENCE I HAD HAD AS I REFLECTED SOME GRATIFICATION OF VANITY AT TOO EARLY AN AGE
AND LOOKED FOR LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT FROM IT SAVE THAT OF KEEPING THE TRADITION UNBROKEN OF WHAT I THOUGHT A BETTER PHILOSOPHY WHAT HOPES I HAD OF EXCITING ANY IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
THROUGH PLACING MY HAPPINESS IN SOMETHING DURABLE AND DISTANT IN WHICH SOME PROGRESS MIGHT BE ALWAYS MAKING WHILE IT COULD NEVER BE EXHAUSTED BY COMPLETE ATTAINMENT THIS DID VERY WELL FOR SEVERAL YEARS DURING WHICH THE GENERAL
IN THE OTHER PART OF MY SUBJECT THE THEORY OF INDUCTION A TREATISE HOWEVER ON A MATTER SO ABSTRACT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO BE POPULAR
CRISIS IN MY MENTAL HISTORY ONE STAGE ONWARD FOR SOME YEARS AFTER THIS TIME I WROTE VERY LITTLE AND NOTHING REGULARLY FOR PUBLICATION AND GREAT WERE THE ADVANTAGES WHICH I DERIVED FROM THE INTERMISSION
I HAD FOUND AN INTERVAL IN WHICH TO EXECUTE WHAT WAS STILL UNDONE OF THE ORIGINAL DRAFT OF THE THIRD BOOK IN WORKING OUT THE LOGICAL THEORY OF THOSE LAWS OF NATURE
IT IS INDEBTED FOR ITS DELIVERANCE TO THAT MOST UNEXPECTED AND SURPRISING FACT THE DEPOPULATION OF IRELAND COMMENCED BY FAMINE
ALL THINGS HURTFUL TO IT THIS DOCTRINE APPEARED INEXPUGNABLE BUT IT NOW SEEMED TO ME ON RETROSPECT THAT MY TEACHERS HAD OCCUPIED THEMSELVES
ARE FAR LESS FREQUENT IN MODERN LIFE THAN THE SMALLER COMMONWEALTHS OF ANTIQUITY THESE CONSIDERATIONS DID NOT MAKE US OVERLOOK THE FOLLY OF
ALL HE WANTED TO COMPLETE HIS EDUCATION WAS LYING THERE READY TO HIS HAND IF ONLY THAT HAND WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO PICK IT UP HE HAD THOUGHT BITTERLY THAT MORNING THAT THERE WAS NO MARKET FOR HIS STRENGTH
MY MAN AND NOW THE BEAST HAS YOU DOWN WITH HIS FANGS IN YOUR THROAT A FAMILY MAN TOO I SHOULD JUDGE BY THAT WELL FILLED TUNIC WELL A WIDOW THE MORE WILL MAKE LITTLE MATTER
THAT REMINDS ME CAPTAIN THAT YOU ARE NOT QUITE SITUATED UPON A BED OF ROSES YOURSELF ARE YOU NOW YOU CAME TO TRAP A WOLF
HEAVY WITH HIS REPAST LAY BACK IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING UP AT THEM THROUGH THE CLOUDS OF HIS TOBACCO SMOKE AND PONDERING OVER THE STRANGE CHANCE
HAVE YOU BEEN WEIGHED LATELY MISTER MONTGOMERY IT WAS THE FIRST DIRECT QUESTION WHICH HAD BEEN ASKED HIM HE HAD STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THEM LIKE A HORSE AT A FAIR AND HE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO WONDER WHETHER HE WAS MORE ANGRY OR AMUSED I AM JUST ELEVEN STONE SAID HE
BUT AFTER A TIME HE HAD GROWN CALLOUS TO IT AND ACCEPTED IT AS IT WAS MEANT BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT WAS INSOLENCE BRUTAL OVERBEARING INSOLENCE WITH PHYSICAL MENACE BEHIND IT WHAT NAME HE ASKED COLDLY
I AM INFORMED THAT A TWO OZ GLOVE IS AN EVASION BY WHICH THEY DODGE THE LAW AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE POLICE TO INTERFERE
WHO FOUGHT AT TEN STONE TWO AT THE TIME HAD THE BETTER OF FIFTEEN RATTLING ROUNDS AND GAINED AN AWARD ON POINTS AGAINST THE MIDLANDER HAVING DISPOSED OF JAMES DUNN OF ROTHERHITHE CAMERON OF GLASGOW AND A YOUTH NAMED FERNIE
HE SHOULD BE BACK AGAIN AT THE UNIVERSITY COMPLETING THE LAST YEAR WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM HIS MEDICAL DEGREE BUT ALAS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY WITH WHICH TO PAY HIS CLASS FEES NOR COULD HE IMAGINE HOW HE COULD PROCURE IT
AND HIS HOST FILLED IT ONCE MORE PRESSING HIM TO GIVE AN ORDER FOR THIS OR THAT DAINTY THERE IS NOTHING IN MY HOUSE WHICH IS NOT AT YOUR DISPOSAL YOU HAVE BUT TO SAY THE WORD
HIS CHEEKS WERE WRINKLED LIKE A LAST YEAR'S APPLE BUT HIS SWEEP OF SHOULDER AND BONY CORDED HANDS TOLD OF A STRENGTH WHICH WAS UNSAPPED BY AGE
A SUNDAY THE IMMACULATE DOCTOR OLDACRE WITH HIS PIOUS CONNECTION A SAVAGE BRAWL WITH A PATIENT HE WOULD IRRETRIEVABLY LOSE HIS SITUATION IF THE FACTS CAME OUT IT WAS NOT MUCH OF A SITUATION BUT HE COULD NOT GET ANOTHER WITHOUT A REFERENCE
AND IT WAS THOSE THOUSAND FRANCS COLONEL NOT A SOU UNTIL YOUR STORY HAS BEEN TESTED COME WHO IS IT WHO HAS MURDERED MY MEN IT IS COUNT EUSTACE OF CHATEAU NOIR
I HAVE A GREAT FAVOUR TO ASK OF YOU THE DOCTOR'S APPEARANCE WAS NOT ENCOURAGING HIS MOUTH SUDDENLY TIGHTENED AND HIS EYES FELL YES MISTER MONTGOMERY YOU ARE AWARE SIR THAT I NEED ONLY ONE MORE SESSION TO COMPLETE MY COURSE
FOR A MOMENT THE ABSURDITY OF THE THING DROVE EVERY OTHER THOUGHT OUT OF MONTGOMERY'S HEAD
BUT WHY BECAUSE TED BARTON WAS TO HAVE FOUGHT HIM NEXT SATURDAY HE WAS THE CHAMPION OF THE WILSON COAL PITS AND THE OTHER WAS THE MASTER OF THE IRON FOLK DOWN AT THE CROXLEY SMELTERS WE'D MATCHED OUR MAN FOR A PURSE OF A HUNDRED AGAINST THE MASTER
I'M SORRY I HIT YOU SO HARD SAID MONTGOMERY APOLOGETICALLY THOU HIT ME HARD I COULD STAN SUCH FLY FLAPPIN ALL DAY TWAS THIS HERE PRESS THAT CRACKED MY PATE FOR ME AND THOU ART A LOOKY MAN TO BE ABLE TO BOAST AS THOU HAST OUTED ME
THE MASTER ADAPTED THE STYLE OF HIS FIGHTING TO HIS PHYSICAL DISABILITIES AND RESUMED HIS CAREER OF VICTORY DEFEATING NORTON THE BLACK HOBBY WILSON AND LEVI COHEN THE LATTER A HEAVY WEIGHT CONCEDING TWO STONE HE FOUGHT A DRAW WITH THE FAMOUS BILLY MC QUIRE
OR ANY OTHER SHAPE WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST ITSELF TO YOU YOU SEE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR HAVING LOST OUR CHAMPION SO WE REALLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE A CLAIM UPON YOU GIVE ME A MOMENT GENTLEMEN IT IS VERY UNEXPECTED
HE HAD LEARNED THE ART OF QUARTERING HIMSELF UPON THE ENEMY WHILE THE BUTLER BROUGHT HIS SUPPER HE OCCUPIED HIMSELF IN MAKING HIS PREPARATIONS FOR A COMFORTABLE NIGHT
FOR THE VOICE WAS A LOUD AND RASPING ONE A YOUNG MAN STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE A STOCKY BULL NECKED YOUNG MINER IN TWEED SUNDAY CLOTHES AND AN AGGRESSIVE NECK TIE HE WAS A SINISTER LOOKING FIGURE WITH DARK INSOLENT EYES
HE LEANED FORWARD BUT THE GERMAN DASHED HIS HAND ASIDE I AM IN YOUR POWER YOU MONSTER HE CRIED I CAN ENDURE YOUR BRUTALITIES BUT NOT YOUR HYPOCRISY THE COUNT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
GAINING AS MUCH PROFIT AS COULD BE GOT FROM A RUSHING TWO HANDED SLOGGER BARTON WAS FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR HIS CLEVERNESS AND QUICKNESS BUT DOUBTFUL ABOUT HIS STRENGTH HARD HITTING WAS THE FEATURE OF HIS OWN STYLE AND HE EXACTED IT FROM OTHERS
THE MURDERED SENTRIES HAD EACH HAD A SALTIRE CROSS SLASHED ACROSS THEIR BROWS AS BY A HUNTING KNIFE THE COLONEL BENT HIS STIFF BACK AND RAN HIS FOREFINGER OVER THE MAP WHICH LAY UPON THE TABLE
HIS CHIN SANK SLOWLY UPON HIS CHEST AND THE TEN CANDLES GLEAMED UPON THE BROAD WHITE SCALP SUDDENLY A SLIGHT NOISE BROUGHT HIM TO HIS FEET FOR AN INSTANT IT SEEMED TO HIS DAZED SENSES
THE BLOWS WERE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS A SAVAGE SWING WHICH WHISTLED PAST MONTGOMERY'S EAR AND A STRAIGHT DRIVE WHICH TOOK THE WORKMAN ON THE CHIN LUCK WAS WITH THE ASSISTANT THAT SINGLE WHIZZING UPPERCUT AND THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS DELIVERED
OFFERED HIM THE BEST HE HAD OPENED A BOTTLE OF GOOD WINE AS I HAVE TRIED TO DO FOR YOU AND GAVE HIM A CIGAR FROM HIS OWN CASE
YOU WILL ARREST THE COUNT AND BRING HIM BACK IF THERE IS AN ATTEMPT AT RESCUE SHOOT HIM AT ONCE HOW MANY MEN SHALL I TAKE COLONEL WELL WE ARE SURROUNDED BY SPIES AND OUR ONLY CHANCE IS TO POUNCE UPON HIM
LOOK HERE SAID HE TURNING ROUND TO THE MINER YOUR MEDICINE WILL BE MADE UP IN ITS TURN AND SENT DOWN TO YOU I DON'T ALLOW FOLK IN THE SURGERY WAIT OUTSIDE IN THE WAITING ROOM IF YOU WISH TO WAIT AT ALL YOONG MAN SAID THE MINER
I AM AFRAID THE DOCTOR WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO MY GOING IN FACT I AM SURE THAT HE WOULD NOT BUT HE NEED NEVER KNOW NOT BEFORE THE FIGHT AT ANY RATE WE ARE NOT BOUND TO GIVE THE NAME OF OUR MAN SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE WEIGHT LIMITS ON THE DAY OF THE FIGHT THAT IS ALL THAT CONCERNS ANYONE
CAPTAIN BAUMGARTEN STAMPED WITH HIS FEET TORE DOWN CURTAINS AND STRUCK WITH THE POMMEL OF HIS SWORD IF THERE WERE SECRET HIDING PLACES HE WAS NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO FIND THEM
AND THEY DO NOT USUALLY REMAIN WIDOWS LONG GET BACK INTO THE CHAIR YOU DOG WELL TO CONTINUE MY STORY
YET ALL DAY HE WAS AWARE OF A SENSE OF VAGUE UNEASINESS WHICH SHARPENED INTO DISMAY WHEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HE WAS INFORMED THAT THREE GENTLEMEN HAD CALLED AND WERE WAITING FOR HIM IN THE SURGERY A CORONER'S INQUEST
I HAVE AN IDEA SAID HE AT LAST SPEAKING IN GERMAN TO THE SERGEANT YOU WILL PLACE A GUARD OVER THIS FELLOW AND MAKE SURE THAT HE COMMUNICATES WITH NO ONE YES CAPTAIN AND YOU WILL PLACE FOUR MEN IN AMBUSH AT THE FRONT AND AT THE BACK
IT IS ABOUT MY SON MY ONLY CHILD EUSTACE WHO WAS TAKEN AND DIED IN ESCAPING IT IS A CURIOUS LITTLE STORY AND I THINK THAT I CAN PROMISE YOU THAT YOU WILL NEVER FORGET IT YOU MUST KNOW THEN THAT MY BOY WAS IN THE ARTILLERY
WHOM THEY WAYLAID IN A WOOD HIDING BY DAY AND TRAVELLING BY NIGHT THEY HAD GOT AS FAR INTO FRANCE AS REMILLY AND WERE WITHIN A MILE A SINGLE MILE CAPTAIN
WHO MAY WISH TO LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BAR ROOM SCRAMBLE AND A SCIENTIFIC CONTEST THE LATEST OF THESE AMBITIOUS SOULS COMES FROM THE WILSON COAL PITS WHICH HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO PUT UP A STAKE OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS AND BACK THEIR LOCAL CHAMPION
THE DOOR OF THE GYMNASIUM HAD OPENED AND A LAD ABOUT SIXTEEN GRIMY AND BLACK WITH SOOT AND IRON STEPPED INTO THE YELLOW GLARE OF THE OIL LAMP TED BARTON SEIZED HIM BY THE COLLAR
AND HE ALSO LEANED FORWARD IN SILENCE FROM HIS CHAIR A FAT RED HAND UPON EITHER KNEE AND STARED CRITICALLY AT THE YOUNG ASSISTANT SO DID THE THIRD VISITOR FAWCETT THE HORSE BREAKER WHO LEANED BACK HIS LONG THIN LEGS WITH THEIR BOXCLOTH RIDING GAITERS
THE UNFORTUNATE SOLDIER WAS DRAGGED FROM HIS CHAIR TO WHERE A NOOSED ROPE HAD BEEN FLUNG OVER ONE OF THE HUGE OAKEN RAFTERS WHICH SPANNED THE ROOM
THE PEASANTS WERE INCORRUPTIBLE THEN GOADED ON BY A MURDERED CORPORAL HE ROSE TO A THOUSAND
THE ASSISTANT STROLLED DOWN THERE AFTER TEA AND ASKED IN A CASUAL WAY WHETHER THE TOBACCONIST HAD EVER HEARD OF THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
THAT'S FARTHEST AWAY BUT IT'S NO USE HE'S JUST LIKE THAT BLOODSTAIN ON LADY MACBETH'S HAND HE WILL NOT OUT KATHLEEN OPEN THE LINEN TRUNK WHILE WE'RE GONE WE CAN'T SET THE TABLE TILL THESE CURSES ARE REMOVED
THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE THE KIND OF GOLDEN SILENCE THAT IS FULL TO THE BRIM OF THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS AND MEMORIES AND HOPES AND DESIRES SO FULL OF ALL THESE AND OTHER BEAUTIFUL QUIET THINGS THAT IT MAKES SPEECH SEEM POOR AND SHABBY
SAID THEIR MOTHER BUT WHEN DID THEY EVER FAIL US
JULIA AND KITTY WOULD LOOK SO ATTRACTIVE GOING ABOUT WITH TAMBOURINES I WANT TO DO WHAT I CAN QUICKLY BECAUSE I SEE PLAINLY I SHALL HAVE TO MARRY YOUNG IN ORDER TO HELP THE FAMILY THE HEROINE ALWAYS DOES THAT IN BOOKS SHE MAKES A WORLDLY MARRIAGE WITH A RICH NOBLEMAN
BATHE AND DRESS DEVOTIONAL EXERCISES
MOTHER CAREY'S CHICKENS
WAS COVERED WITH A CHEAP GAY CHINTZ AND CRIMSON JACQUEMINOT ROSES CLAMBERED ALL OVER THE WALL PAPER
COULD SIT DOWN IN IT AND ENTERTAIN THE WHOLE FAMILY WITHOUT CHARGING THEM A PENNY THE HOUSEWARMING COULD NOT BE UNTIL THE LATER AUTUMN MISSUS CAREY HAD DECIDED FOR ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE LIVING ROOMS COULD BE FINISHED
THE WINDOW OVER THE FRONT DOOR WAS AS BEAUTIFUL A WINDOW AS ANY IN THE COUNTY AND THE DOORWAY ITSELF WAS CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE IT HAD A WONDERFUL FAN LIGHT AND SIDE LIGHTS GREEN BLIND DOORS OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE PAINTED ONE WITH ITS MASSIVE BRASS KNOCKER
NANCY HAD ONCE LIGHTED HER CANDLE AND SLIPPED DOWNSTAIRS AT MIDNIGHT TO SIT ON THE PARLOR SOFA AND FEAST HER EYES ON THE ROOM'S LOVELINESS GILBERT HAD PAINTED THE WHITE MATTING THE COLOR OF A RIPE CHERRY
THE VERY IDEA IS HORRIBLE I'M COMING OUT IN THE BARN NEXT SUMMER MUDDY NANCY CALLED TO HER MOTHER WHO JUST THEN ENTERED THE DOOR IF WE ARE POORER THAN EVER WE CAN TAKE UP A COLLECTION TO DEFRAY THE EXPENSES
AND MOTHER SAID IT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL SPOT TO BRING UP A FAMILY WE CHILDREN HAD WRIGGLED UNDER THE FENCE AND WERE CLIMBING THE APPLE TREES BY THAT TIME AND WE WANTED TO BE BROUGHT UP THERE THAT VERY MINUTE
COUSIN ANN'S EXPENSIVE IMPROVEMENTS WERE NOT TO BE SET IN MOTION UNTIL BILL HARMON HEARD FROM MISTER HAMILTON THAT HIS TENANTS WERE NOT TO BE DISTURBED FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS THE HOUSE WHICH WAS DAILY GROWING INTO A HOME
SHE TOOK THE LAST STEP UPWARD AND STANDING IN THE DOORWAY TREMBLING SAID SOFTLY AS SHE TURNED THE KEY COME HOME CHILDREN NANCY GILBERT KATHLEEN PETER BIRD
IT DOESN'T SEEM PROPER TO THINK OF GIVING ENTERTAINMENTS WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS OUR CIRCUMSTANCES HOW POOR WE ARE JULIA SAID REBUKINGLY WE ARE TALKING OF NEXT SUMMER MY CHILD WHO CAN SAY HOW RICH WE SHALL BE NEXT SUMMER
OH HOW JULIA DISLIKED NANCY AT THIS EPOCH IN THEIR COMMON HISTORY AND HOW CORDIALLY AND VIGOROUSLY THE DISLIKE WAS RETURNED MANY AN UNHAPPY MOMENT DID MOTHER CAREY HAVE OVER THE FEUD MOSTLY DEEP AND SILENT
BY TAKING A TURN WITH THE LUNCHEON KNIVES AND SPOONS THEN I PLANTED THE ROSE AND FATHER TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND SAID THREE CHEERS FOR THE YELLOW HOUSE AND MOTHER ADDED GOD BLESS IT AND THE CHILDREN WHO COME TO LIVE IN IT
BECAUSE A CHILD THAT HAS NO CAPABILITY OF DOING THE WRONG THING WILL HARDLY BE ABLE TO MANAGE A RIGHT ONE NOT ONE OF THE BIG SORT ANYWAY AT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OLD JULIA WAS ALWAYS SPOKEN OF AS SUCH A GOOD LITTLE GIRL
JULIA SAID BUT HE NEVER LOOKS AT ANYBODY OR TALKS TO ANYBODY BUT YOU SO IT'S WELL YOU LIKE HIM THOUGH YOU LIKE ALL BOYS FOR THAT MATTER THE BOYS RETURN THE COMPLIMENT ASSERTED KITTY MISCHIEVOUSLY WHILE POOR YOU AND I SIT IN CORNERS
WHAT WE NEED MOST IS BUTTER EGGS MILK AND FLOUR GILBERT OPEN THE BOX OF EATABLES PLEASE AND NANCY UNLOCK THE TRUNK THAT HAS THE BED LINEN IN IT WE LITTLE THOUGHT WE SHOULD FIND SUCH FRIENDS HERE DID WE
MY BLOOD SEEMS TO BE TOO RED AND IT COURSES WILDLY THROUGH MY VEINS AS THE BOOKS SAY I AM GOING TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF NOW THAT COUSIN ANN'S GONE AND OUR ONLY CROSS IS JULIA OH BUT IT IS RATHER DREADFUL TO THINK HOW ONE PERSON CAN SPOIL THE WORLD
FIXIN IT UP SO'T NOBODY COULD KEEP CRITTERS IN IT SO NO MORE FROM YOUR OLD SCHOOL FREND BILL HARMON P S WE'VE BEEN HAVING A SPELL OF TURRIBLE HOT WETHER IN BEULAH HOW IS IT WITH YOU
IF ONLY YOU COULD HAVE SEEN THE YELLOW HOUSE AFTER COUSIN ANA WENT IF ONLY YOU COULD HAVE HEARD THE HOTEL LANDLADY EXCLAIM AS SHE DROVE PAST WELL GOOD RIDDANCE TO BAD RUBBISH THE WEATHER GREW WARMER OUTSIDE ALMOST AT ONCE
AS I SUPPOSE BILL HARMON TOLD YOU WHEN HE SENT YOU MOTHER'S CHECK FOR FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER WE THINK IT IS VERY REASONABLE AND DO NOT WONDER YOU DON'T LIKE TO SPEND ANYTHING ON REPAIRS OR IMPROVEMENTS FOR US AS YOU HAVE TO PAY TAXES AND INSURANCE
IT WAS JUST A QUIET LITTLE SUNNY VERDANT LEAFY PIECE OF HEART'S CONTENT THAT'S WHAT BEULAH WAS AND JULIA COULDN'T SPOIL IT INDEED THE ODDS WERE THAT IT WOULD SWEETEN JULIA
CRAZY HAMILTON BOYS LIGHT HEARTED IRRESPONSIBLE AND FRIVOLOUS CHANGES THAT COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN COMPASSED BY THE CAREYS SLENDER INCOME THEY HAD NO MONEY TO PURCHASE HORSE OR COW OR PIG AND NO MAN IN THE FAMILY TO TAKE CARE OF THEM IF PURCHASED
OBJECTED JULIA CONVENTIONALLY NOT IN A DRAWING ROOM PERHAPS BUT PERFECTLY WELL IN A BARN EVEN YOU AND KITTY YOUTHFUL AS YOU WILL STILL BE CAN ATTEND MY COMING OUT PARTY IN A BARN
PREPARATION FOR SUPPER FIVE TO SIX WHOLESOME READING WALKING OR CONVERSATION SEVEN TO EIGHT DEVOTIONAL EXERCISES NINE BED
THE OLD FASHIONED SQUARE PIANO LOOKED IN ITS ELEMENT PLACED ACROSS ONE CORNER WITH THE FOUR TALL SILVER CANDLESTICKS AND SNUFFER TRAY ON THE SHINING MAHOGANY ALL THE SHABBIEST FURNITURE AND THE CAREY FURNITURE WAS MOSTLY SHABBY
FOR IT IS OUR MOTHER IT IS ONLY A SNAP SHOT
ARE SO DISGUSTING THEY DO SMELL NANCY THEY DO SAID NANCY STERNLY
WE ALL OF US LOOK BACK TO THAT DAY AS THE HAPPIEST ONE THAT WE CAN REMEMBER MOTHER LAUGHS WHEN I TALK OF LOOKING BACK
THIS INDEED HAD BEEN THE DIVERSION OF THEIR SIMPLE LIFE FOR MANY YEARS AND WAS JUST AS DELIGHTFUL IN THEIR OPINION AS BUYING NEW THINGS ANY CAREY FROM MOTHER DOWN TO PETER
I GOT YOUR EXTENSION TABLE INTO THE DINING ROOM SAID BILL AND TRIED MY BEST TO FIND YOUR DISHES BUT I DIDN'T MAKE OUT UP TO THE TIME YOU GOT HERE MEBBE YOU MARKED EM SOMEWAY SO'T YOU KNOW WHICH TO UNPACK FIRST
MOTHER SAYS SHE FEELS AS IF HE HAD PASTED LAUGHTER AND GOOD NATURE ON ALL THE WALLS AS HE PAPERED THEM WHEN YOU OPEN THE FRONT DOOR AND WE HOPE YOU WILL SOMETIME AND WALK RIGHT IN HOW LOVELY IT WILL BE TO LOOK INTO YELLOW HAYFIELDS
AND DIDN'T BELIEVE THE KITCHEN STOVE WOULD EVER DRAW SHE WAS SURE THAT THERE WERE DEAD TOADS AND FROGS IN THE WELL THE HOUSE WAS INCONVENIENT AND ALWAYS WOULD BE TILL WATER WAS BROUGHT INTO THE KITCHEN SINK
THEY STOOD ROOTED TO THE FLOOR GAZING AT THE CURSE OF THE HOUSE OF CAREY AS IF THEIR EYES MUST DECEIVE THEM
LITTLE DID HE KNOW AS HE CARELESSLY STOOD THERE AT THE WAGON WHEEL THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BESTOW UPON THAT SMALL BOY OFFERINGS FROM HIS STOCK FOR YEARS TO COME HE AND COLONEL WHEELER WERE SPEEDILY LIFTING THINGS FROM THE CARRYALL
BILL HARMON STOOD IN THE FRONT DOORWAY SMILING
ON WHICH THE CHILDREN THRIVED SO SHE WENT TO THE SO CALLED HOTEL FOR HER MEALS HER REMARKS TO THE LANDLADY AFTER TWO DINNERS AND ONE SUPPER WERE OF A CHARACTER NOT TO BE ENDURED BY ANY OUTSPOKEN
OLD AND NEW THE YELLOW HOUSE HAD NOT ALWAYS BELONGED TO THE HAMILTONS BUT HAD BEEN BUILT BY A GOVERNOR OF THE STATE WHEN HE RETIRED FROM PUBLIC OFFICE HE LIVED ONLY A FEW YEARS
AND YOU WILL GET JULIA NANCY WAS TRIUMPHANT OVER THIS RECIPE FOR MAKING JULIAS ONLY REGRETTING THAT SHE COULD NEVER SHOW IT TO HER MOTHER WHO IF CRITICAL WAS ALWAYS MOST APPRECIATIVE
PANTED KATHLEEN AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS AND HAD TO BE DRIVEN FIVE MILES
JULIA WAILED THEY WERE ALWAYS TRYING
PEOPLE FANCY THAT I MAKE THINGS MY LITTLE DEAR SAYS MOTHER CAREY TO TOM THE WATER BABY BUT I SIT HERE AND MAKE THEM MAKE THEMSELVES THERE WAS ONCE A FAIRY SO THE TALE GOES WHO WAS SO CLEVER THAT SHE FOUND OUT HOW TO MAKE BUTTERFLIES
NO AMETHYST FOOTHILLS TO ENCHAIN THE EYE NO WONDERFUL CANYONS AND SPLENDID ROCKY PASSES TO MAKE THE TOURIST MARVEL NO LENGTH OF YELLOW SEA SANDS NOR PLASH OF OCEAN SURF NO TRADE NO AMUSEMENTS NO SUMMER VISITORS
OR BY REFLECTION ON ITS OWN OPERATIONS TAKES NOTICE ALSO THAT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THESE SIMPLE IDEAS GO CONSTANTLY TOGETHER WHICH BEING PRESUMED TO BELONG TO ONE THING AND WORDS BEING SUITED TO COMMON APPREHENSIONS
OR ANY OTHER IDEA RETURNING CONSTANTLY AT EQUIDISTANT PERIODS AND MAKING ITSELF UNIVERSALLY BE TAKEN NOTICE OF WOULD NOT FAIL TO MEASURE OUT THE COURSE OF SUCCESSION AND DISTINGUISH THE DISTANCES OF TIME
WE HAVE AS CLEAR A NOTION OF THE SUBSTANCE OF SPIRIT AS WE HAVE OF BODY THE ONE BEING SUPPOSED TO BE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IT IS THE SUBSTRATUM TO THOSE SIMPLE IDEAS WE HAVE FROM WITHOUT AND THE OTHER SUPPOSED WITH A LIKE IGNORANCE OF WHAT IT IS
HOW DERIVED FROM THE TWO FOUNTAINS OF ALL OUR KNOWLEDGE SENSATION AND REFLECTION I SHALL IN THE NEXT PLACE CONSIDER CHAPTER TWENTY SIX OF CAUSE AND EFFECT AND OTHER RELATIONS ONE
BUT YET A HORSE WE CALL OLD AT TWENTY AND A DOG AT SEVEN YEARS BECAUSE IN EACH OF THESE WE COMPARE THEIR AGE TO DIFFERENT IDEAS OF DURATION WHICH ARE SETTLED IN OUR MINDS AS BELONGING TO THESE SEVERAL SORTS OF ANIMALS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF NATURE
BUT THE OTHER WHILST IT HAS NOT A COMMON RECEIVED NAME OF ANY KNOWN LANGUAGE ASSIGNED TO IT IS NOT CAPABLE OF ANY DEFORMITY BEING MADE WITH NO REFERENCE TO ANYTHING BUT ITSELF
WHICH IS BUT A LITTLE ONE TO A FLEMING THEY TWO HAVING FROM THE DIFFERENT BREED OF THEIR COUNTRIES TAKEN SEVERAL SIZED IDEAS TO WHICH THEY COMPARE AND IN RELATION TO WHICH THEY DENOMINATE THEIR GREAT AND THEIR LITTLE SIX
ONE AFTER ANOTHER HE HATH THEN DURING SUCH DREAMING A SENSE OF DURATION AND OF THE LENGTH OF IT BY WHICH IT IS TO ME VERY CLEAR THAT MEN DERIVE THEIR IDEAS OF DURATION FROM THEIR REFLECTIONS ON THE TRAIN OF THE IDEAS THEY OBSERVE TO SUCCEED ONE ANOTHER IN THEIR OWN UNDERSTANDINGS
THIRTY ONE CONTINUANCE OF THAT WHICH WE HAVE MADE TO BE OUR COMPLEX IDEA OF MAN MAKES THE SAME MAN FOR SUPPOSING A RATIONAL SPIRIT BE THE IDEA OF A MAN IT IS EASY TO KNOW WHAT IS THE SAME MAN VIZ THE SAME SPIRIT
WHICH WE SEE IS THE SENSE OF MANKIND IN THE SOLEMNEST DECLARATION OF THEIR OPINIONS HUMAN LAWS NOT PUNISHING THE MAD MAN FOR THE SOBER MAN'S ACTIONS NOR THE SOBER MAN FOR WHAT THE MAD MAN DID THEREBY MAKING THEM TWO PERSONS
AN ACCURATE COLLECTION OF SUNDRY IDEAS IS NECESSARY A MAN IF HE COMPARES TWO THINGS TOGETHER CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED NOT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS WHEREIN HE COMPARES THEM SO THAT WHEN HE COMPARES ANY THINGS TOGETHER HE CANNOT BUT HAVE A VERY CLEAR IDEA OF THAT RELATION
THOSE ARE FANTASTICAL WHICH ARE MADE UP OF SUCH COLLECTIONS OF SIMPLE IDEAS AS WERE REALLY NEVER UNITED NEVER WERE FOUND TOGETHER IN ANY SUBSTANCE
AS I ONCE MET WITH ONE WHO WAS PERSUADED HIS HAD BEEN THE SOUL OF SOCRATES HOW REASONABLY I WILL NOT DISPUTE THIS I KNOW THAT IN THE POST HE FILLED WHICH WAS NO INCONSIDERABLE ONE HE PASSED FOR A VERY RATIONAL MAN
SINCE IT IS EVIDENT THE PERSONAL IDENTITY WOULD EQUALLY BE DETERMINED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS WHETHER THAT CONSCIOUSNESS WERE ANNEXED TO SOME INDIVIDUAL IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCE OR NO FOR GRANTING THAT THE THINKING SUBSTANCE IN MAN MUST BE NECESSARILY SUPPOSED IMMATERIAL
WHICH ACCORDING TO THE TRUE IMPORT OF THE WORD IS IN PLAIN ENGLISH STANDING UNDER OR UPHOLDING THREE OF THE SORTS OF SUBSTANCES AN OBSCURE AND RELATIVE IDEA OF SUBSTANCE IN GENERAL
BUT BECAUSE HE HAS PUT IN OR LEFT OUT OF HIS SOME SIMPLE IDEA WHICH THE OTHER HAS NOT THE QUESTION THEN IS WHICH OF THESE ARE REAL AND WHICH BARELY IMAGINARY COMBINATIONS WHAT COLLECTIONS AGREE TO THE REALITY OF THINGS AND WHAT NOT AND TO THIS I SAY THAT
BESIDES ALL THOSE SIMPLE IDEAS THEY ARE MADE UP OF HAVE ALWAYS THE CONFUSED IDEA OF SOMETHING TO WHICH THEY BELONG AND IN WHICH THEY SUBSIST AND THEREFORE WHEN WE SPEAK OF ANY SORT OF SUBSTANCE WE SAY IT IS A THING HAVING SUCH OR SUCH QUALITIES
WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR INVADED ENGLAND ABOUT THE YEAR TEN SIXTY SIX WHICH MEANS THIS THAT TAKING THE DURATION FROM OUR SAVIOUR'S TIME TILL NOW FOR ONE ENTIRE GREAT LENGTH OF TIME IT SHOWS AT WHAT DISTANCE THIS INVASION WAS FROM THE TWO EXTREMES
BUT FATHER BROTHER KING HUSBAND
MAN WOULD NOT BE TWO AS DISTINCT PERSONS AS SOCRATES AND PLATO AND WHETHER IN THE SECOND CASE THERE WOULD NOT BE ONE PERSON IN TWO DISTINCT BODIES AS MUCH AS ONE MAN IS THE SAME IN TWO DISTINCT CLOTHINGS
SIMPLE IDEAS ARE ALL REAL APPEARANCES OF THINGS FIRST OUR SIMPLE IDEAS ARE ALL REAL ALL AGREE TO THE REALITY OF THINGS NOT THAT THEY ARE ALL OF THEM THE IMAGES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF WHAT DOES EXIST THE CONTRARY WHEREOF
BUT BE THAT AS IT WILL THIS IS CERTAIN THAT WHOEVER PURSUES HIS OWN THOUGHTS WILL FIND THEM SOMETIMES LAUNCH OUT BEYOND THE EXTENT OF BODY INTO THE INFINITY OF SPACE OR EXPANSION
WHATEVER SUBSTANCE BEGINS TO EXIST IT MUST DURING ITS EXISTENCE NECESSARILY BE THE SAME WHATEVER COMPOSITIONS OF SUBSTANCES BEGIN TO EXIST DURING THE UNION OF THOSE SUBSTANCES THE CONCRETE MUST BE THE SAME
THE LIKE WHEN WE SAY THE CREATURES ARE ALL WEAK THINGS WEAK THERE IS BUT A RELATIVE TERM SIGNIFYING THE DISPROPORTION THERE IS IN THE POWER OF GOD AND THE CREATURES
IS AS MUCH ONE IDEA AS THE IDEA OF ANY THE LEAST PARTICLE OF MATTER IN IT IT SUFFICING TO THE UNITY OF ANY IDEA THAT IT BE CONSIDERED AS ONE REPRESENTATION OR PICTURE THOUGH MADE UP OF EVER SO MANY PARTICULARS TWO
WHICH I SO CALL BECAUSE SUCH IDEAS ARE MADE UP OF MANY PARTICULAR SUBSTANCES CONSIDERED TOGETHER AS UNITED INTO ONE IDEA AND WHICH SO JOINED ARE LOOKED ON AS ONE
IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO SATISFY HIM THAT THEY ARE INFALLIBLY SO SINCE WE CANNOT BE SURE THAT THE CAUSE OF THAT MOTION WHICH IS UNKNOWN TO US SHALL ALWAYS OPERATE EQUALLY AND WE ARE SURE THAT THE MEDIUM IN WHICH THE PENDULUM MOVES IS NOT CONSTANTLY THE SAME
IS NOW NO MORE SO THAN A PART OF ANOTHER MAN'S SELF IS A PART OF ME AND IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IN A LITTLE TIME MAY BECOME A REAL PART OF ANOTHER PERSON AND SO WE HAVE THE SAME NUMERICAL SUBSTANCE BECOME A PART OF TWO DIFFERENT PERSONS
WHICH QUESTION SEEMS TO ME TO BE BUILT ON THIS WHETHER THE SAME IMMATERIAL BEING BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE ACTION OF ITS PAST DURATION MAY BE WHOLLY STRIPPED OF ALL THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF ITS PAST EXISTENCE
TO THE IDEA OF THAT DURATION WHICH WE HAVE IN OUR MINDS AS ORDINARILY BELONGING TO THAT SORT OF ANIMALS WHICH IS PLAIN IN THE APPLICATION OF THESE NAMES TO OTHER THINGS FOR A MAN IS CALLED YOUNG AT TWENTY YEARS AND VERY YOUNG AT SEVEN YEARS OLD
TO HELP US A LITTLE IN THIS WE MUST CONSIDER WHAT IS MEANT BY SOCRATES OR THE SAME INDIVIDUAL MAN FIRST IT MUST BE EITHER THE SAME INDIVIDUAL IMMATERIAL THINKING SUBSTANCE IN SHORT THE SAME NUMERICAL SOUL AND NOTHING ELSE
NOTHING BUT POWERS IN IT TO PRODUCE THOSE IDEAS IN US
HATH THEREBY IN OUR MINDS THE RELATION OF A CAUSE AND SO IS DENOMINATED BY US TWO CREATION GENERATION MAKING ALTERATION
WILL BE ABLE TO FURNISH US WITH THESE IDEAS AS CLEAR AND DISTINCT AS MANY OTHERS WHICH ARE THOUGHT MUCH LESS OBSCURE AND WE SHALL FIND THAT THE IDEA OF ETERNITY ITSELF IS DERIVED FROM THE SAME COMMON ORIGINAL WITH THE REST OF OUR IDEAS THREE NATURE AND ORIGIN
WHICH IS SOMEWHAT EXPLAINED BY OUR WAY OF SPEAKING IN ENGLISH WHEN WE SAY SUCH AN ONE IS NOT HIMSELF OR IS BESIDE HIMSELF IN WHICH PHRASES IT IS INSINUATED AS IF THOSE WHO NOW OR AT LEAST FIRST USED THEM THOUGHT THAT SELF WAS CHANGED
NOR IS IT AT ALL MATERIAL TO SAY THAT THIS SAME AND THIS DISTINCT CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE CASES ABOVE MENTIONED IS OWING TO THE SAME AND DISTINCT IMMATERIAL SUBSTANCES BRINGING IT WITH THEM TO THOSE BODIES WHICH WHETHER TRUE OR NO ALTERS NOT THE CASE
AS WANTING THAT EVIDENT MARK OF RELATION WHICH IS BETWEEN CORRELATIVES WHICH SEEM TO EXPLAIN ONE ANOTHER AND NOT TO BE ABLE TO EXIST BUT TOGETHER HENCE IT IS THAT MANY OF THOSE NAMES WHICH DULY CONSIDERED DO INCLUDE EVIDENT RELATIONS
TWENTY SIX THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE WORLD IS NEITHER BOUNDLESS NOR ETERNAL
INDEED A MAN HAVING FROM REFLECTING ON THE SUCCESSION AND NUMBER OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS GOT THE NOTION OR IDEA OF DURATION HE CAN APPLY THAT NOTION TO THINGS WHICH EXIST WHILE HE DOES NOT THINK
MIXED MODES AND RELATIONS MADE OF CONSISTENT IDEAS ARE REAL SECONDLY MIXED MODES AND RELATIONS HAVING NO OTHER REALITY BUT WHAT THEY HAVE IN THE MINDS OF MEN THERE IS NOTHING MORE REQUIRED TO THIS KIND OF IDEAS TO MAKE THEM REAL
TWENTY PERSONS NOT SUBSTANCES THE OBJECTS OF REWARD AND PUNISHMENT IN THIS PERSONAL IDENTITY IS FOUNDED ALL THE RIGHT AND JUSTICE OF REWARD AND PUNISHMENT
EIGHT VERY SWIFT MOTIONS UNPERCEIVED ON THE CONTRARY THINGS THAT MOVE SO SWIFT AS NOT TO AFFECT THE SENSES DISTINCTLY WITH SEVERAL DISTINGUISHABLE DISTANCES OF THEIR MOTION AND SO CAUSE NOT ANY TRAIN OF IDEAS IN THE MIND ARE NOT ALSO PERCEIVED
RESOLUTION AND NERVE THE BREED WAS EXACTLY ADAPTED TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT DAY WHICH WAS NOT QUITE AS FAST AS THE PRESENT MEN SHOT WITH GOOD JOE MANTONS DID THEIR OWN LOADING
IT APPEARS LIKE DESCENDING FROM THE SUBLIME TO THE RIDICULOUS TO MENTION THE GREYHOUND AS A SHOW DOG
THEY DO NOT PERHAPS POSSESS THE OUTWARD BEAUTY AND DISTINCTION OF TYPE WHICH WOULD JUSTIFY THEIR BEING BROUGHT INTO GENERAL NOTICE BUT AS WORKERS THEY RETAIN ALL THE FIRE AND VERVE THAT ARE REQUIRED IN DOGS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO ENCOUNTER SUCH VICIOUS VERMIN AS THE BADGER AND THE FOX
HIS EXCELLENCE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ROAST MUTTON THOUGH IN HIS OWN COUNTRY HE IS REGARDED AS PLEBEIAN JUST A COMMON CUR HE IS BY NO MEANS A MONGREL THAT HE IS OF ANCIENT LINEAGE
THE DISCHARGE FROM THE EYES IS SIMPLY MUCUS AND PUS BUT IF NOT CONSTANTLY DRIED AWAY WILL GUM THE INFLAMED LIDS TOGETHER THAT FROM THE NOSTRILS IS NOT ONLY PURULENT BUT OFTEN MIXED WITH DARK BLOOD THE APPETITE IS NOW CLEAN GONE
ASCENDING TO A MODERATE PEAK EARS THE EARS ARE LONG AND SWEEPING BUT NOT FEATHERED DOWN TO THE TIPS SET LOW AND LYING FLAT TO THE CHEEKS EYES
SOME YEARS AGO IS ADDED THE POINTS ARE FAIRLY RIGHT BUT THE TONGUE OF A LIVE CHOW IS NEVER BLACK IT SHOULD BE BLUE SUCH A COLOUR AS MIGHT RESULT FROM A DIET OF BILBERRIES POINTS OF THE CHOW CHOW HEAD SKULL FLAT AND BROAD WITH LITTLE STOP
THE UNINITIATED MAY BE INFORMED THAT DALMATIAN PUPPIES ARE ALWAYS BORN PURE WHITE THE CLEARER AND WHITER THEY ARE THE BETTER THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE THERE SHOULD NOT BE THE SHADOW OF A MARK OR SPOT ON THEM
IN FACT A SCOTTISH TERRIER THOUGH ESSENTIALLY A TERRIER CANNOT BE TOO POWERFULLY PUT TOGETHER AND SHOULD BE FROM ABOUT NINE INCHES TO TWELVE INCHES IN HEIGHT SPECIAL FAULTS MUZZLE EITHER UNDER OR OVER HUNG EYES LARGE OR LIGHT COLOURED
MISTER EVERETT OF FELIXSTOWE IS NOW ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL BREEDERS HE EXHIBITED AT THE NINETEEN O EIGHT KENNEL CLUB SHOW A MOST PROMISING YOUNG DOG IN FELIXSTOWE KILRONAN
WHEN AFTER THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NATIONAL FEELING WAS PULSATING VERY STRONGLY IN THE VEINS OF REUNITED GERMANY THE GERMAN CYNOLOGISTS WERE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A NATIONAL DOG AND FOR THAT PURPOSE THE GREAT DANE WAS RE CHRISTENED
BUT HAVING NO FEATHER OR DEW CLAWS THE WHOLE CLAWS SHOULD BE DARK BUT THE CLAWS OF ALL VARY IN SHADE ACCORDING TO THE COLOUR OF THE DOG'S BODY COAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT POINT
AT A LATER DATE THE FAMED COMING STILL
AND ON THE LAWNS OF THE BOTANICAL GARDENS AND THE EXAMPLE SUGGESTS THE POSSIBILITY THAT IN ANOTHER DECADE OR SO THE NEGLECTED SEALYHAM TERRIER THE IGNORED TERRIER OF THE BORDERS AND THE ALMOST FORGOTTEN JACK RUSSELL STRAIN
NOR SO PENDULOUS IN LIP AS A POINTER THERE SHOULD BE NO COARSENESS OR COMMON LOOK ABOUT THE SKULL A FAULT WHICH IS MUCH TOO PREVALENT
THE FEET WELL FORMED AND NOT FLAT WITH VERY STRONG BROWN OR DARK COLOURED CLAWS BANDY LEGS AND FLAT FEET ARE OBJECTIONABLE THE HAIR ON THE FORE LEGS AND FEET OF A PEPPER DOG SHOULD BE TAN
AND ALWAYS IN REMARKABLY CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDES USUALLY THESE GREEK GREYHOUNDS ARE REPRESENTED WITH PRICK EARS BUT OCCASIONALLY THE TRUE ROSE EAR IS SHOWN ALL WRITINGS IN CONNECTION WITH GREYHOUNDS POINT TO THE HIGH ESTIMATION
AS THE DISEASE CREEPS DOWNWARDS AND INWARDS ALONG THE AIR PASSAGES THE CHEST GETS MORE AND MORE AFFECTED THE DISCHARGE OF MUCUS AND PUS FROM THE NOSTRILS MORE ABUNDANT AND THE COUGH LOSES ITS DRY CHARACTER BECOMING MOIST
BUT IN VIEW OF THE HANDICAP TERMS THOSE DOGS WHICH POSSESS SPEED
ANY DISTANCE BETWEEN SIX AND A DOZEN MILES A DAY ACCORDING TO THE STAMINA AND CONDITION OF THE DOG IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE PROPER AMOUNT OF EXERCISE AND SCALES ARE BROUGHT INTO USE EVERY FEW DAYS TO GAUGE THE EFFECT WHICH IS BEING PRODUCED
IT IS A USEFUL ITEM IN THE BILL OF FARE BREAD WELL SOAKED IN VERY STRONG STOCK SHEEP'S HEAD AND LIVER ARE ALWAYS BETTER AS REGULAR DIET THAN MEAT
THAT THE GREYHOUND IS COMELY IN GOING AS WELL AS IN REPOSE WAS RECOGNISED VERY EARLY BY THE GREEKS WHOSE ARTISTS WERE FOND OF INTRODUCING THIS GRACEFUL ANIMAL AS AN ORNAMENT IN THEIR DECORATIVE WORKMANSHIP
EYES SET WIDE APART LARGE FULL ROUND BRIGHT EXPRESSIVE OF GREAT DETERMINATION INTELLIGENCE AND DIGNITY SET LOW AND PROMINENT IN FRONT OF THE HEAD COLOUR A RICH DARK HAZEL
HAS OCCASIONALLY BEEN CRITICISED FOR HER ADVOCACY OF WHOLE COLOURED SPECIMENS BUT IN SUPPORT OF THIS PREFERENCE IT CAN BE PROVED THAT THE ORIGINAL PAIR BROUGHT TO GOODWOOD
THAT WAS INAUGURATED AND THIS NOW REMAINS WITH THE CHAMPION STAKES AS ITS MOST IMPORTANT EVENT AFTERWARDS CAME THE AMESBURY MEETING IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWO BUT AMESBURY LIKE ASHDOWN ALTHOUGH FOR MANY YEARS ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED INSTITUTIONS OF THE DESCRIPTION
AND AS NO BRINDLED PARTI COLOURED OR BLACK DOG HAS EVER BEEN BORN AT GOODWOOD OR BROUGHTON
A VIEW HAS BEEN TAKEN THAT THE SPANISH DOUBLE NOSED POINTER WAS INTRODUCED INTO ENGLAND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN FIRE ARMS WERE BEGINNING TO BE POPULAR FOR FOWLING PURPOSES SETTERS AND SPANIELS HAD BEEN USED TO FIND AND DRIVE BIRDS INTO NETS
MISTER BAKER OF BALLYTOBIN FOR ANOTHER AND MISTER MAHONEY OF DROMORE FOR THE REMAINING STRAIN FROM BITCHES OBTAINED FROM TWO OF THESE KENNELS CAPTAIN GRAHAM BY CROSSING THEM WITH THE GREAT DANE AND SCOTTISH DEERHOUND
RAJAH OF KIDNAL WHO WAS BRED AND EXHIBITED BY MISSUS A GERARD OF MALPAS WAS THE SELECTION OF CAPTAIN GRAHAM AND TWO OTHER JUDGES THIS DOG WHICH HAS BEEN RENAMED BRIAN BORU IS STILL HEARTY AND WELL
BY A SYSTEM OF ARTIFICIAL BREEDING TO SHOW POINTS FEW OF THESE OLD UNREGISTERED BREEDS WOULD ATTRACT THE EYE OF THE FANCIER ACCUSTOMED TO JUDGE A DOG PARADING BEFORE HIM IN THE SHOW RING TO KNOW THEIR VALUE AND TO APPRECIATE THEIR STERLING GOOD QUALITIES
HEAD STRONGLY MADE AND LARGE NOT OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE DOG'S SIZE THE MUSCLES SHOWING EXTRAORDINARY DEVELOPMENT MORE ESPECIALLY THE MAXILLARY SKULL
HELD WELL UP SNAKELIKE IN CARRIAGE
THIS WAS DISCOVERED AT GOODWOOD YEARS AGO BY THE FACT THAT ON TWO OR THREE OCCASIONS ONE CELESTIAL LADY WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN GREATER ATTENTION THAN SHE CONSIDERED NECESSARY
LADY SAMUELSON'S TOGO
BUT ON THE WHOLE IT MAY BE STATED WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THE JAPANESE IS PROSPERING IN ENGLAND THANKS LARGELY TO THE ENERGETIC WORK OF THE JAPANESE CHIN CLUB WHICH WAS FORMED SOME THREE YEARS AGO
THE MORE REST THE DOG HAS THE BETTER HE MUST BE KEPT FREE FROM EXCITEMENT
IN A PART OF THE GARDEN FREQUENTED BY AN AUNT OF THE EMPEROR WHO HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE ON THE APPROACH OF THE ALLIED FORCES LORD JOHN AND ANOTHER NAVAL OFFICER
THEY MAY NOT IN ALL CASES HAVE THE BEAUTY OF SHAPE WHICH IS DESIRED ON THE SHOW BENCH
BEING A TOY DOG THE SMALLER THE BETTER PROVIDED TYPE AND POINTS ARE NOT SACRIFICED ANYTHING OVER EIGHTEEN POUNDS SHOULD DISQUALIFY WHEN DIVIDED BY WEIGHT
OR FINISHED SO AS TO MEET IT BUT SHOULD THE LOWER JAW BE SLIGHTLY UNDERHUNG IT IS NOT A BLEMISH PROVIDED THE TEETH ARE NOT SHOWN IN CONSEQUENCE NOSE
THE TERM RED INCLUDES ALL SHADES SABLE BRINDLE LEMON OR ORANGE BUT THE BRIGHTER AND CLEARER THE RED THE BETTER THE WHITE SHOULD BE CLEAR WHITE
WITHOUT VARIATION FOR SEX BEING CONSIDERED ALTOGETHER TOO HEAVY APPEARANCES ARE SOMETIMES DECEPTIVE BUT THESE DOGS ARE RARELY WEIGHED FOR EXHIBITION PURPOSES
THE INTERMIXTURE OF THESE CANINE GIANTS HOWEVER WAS NOT AT FIRST VERY SATISFACTORY AS ALTHOUGH PLENTY OF BONE WAS OBTAINED MANY WERE MOST UNGAINLY IN APPEARANCE AND ILL SHAPED ANIMALS THAT HAD VERY LITTLE ABOUT THEM TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
IMPROVEMENTS CAME BY DEGREES UNTIL THEY SET IN VERY RAPIDLY BUT PROBABLY BY SEVENTEEN FIFTY WHEN HUNTING HAD PROGRESSED A GOOD DEAL AND PACE WAS INCREASED IN ALL PASTIMES
AH CUM WAS MATED WITHOUT DELAY TO TWO GOODWOOD BITCHES THE RESULT BEING IN THE FIRST LITTERS
BUT AS THE SPANISH POINTER BECAME KNOWN IT WAS APPARENTLY CONSIDERED THAT HE ALONE HAD THE CAPACITY TO FIND GAME FOR THE GUN THIS MUST HAVE BEEN TOWARDS THE END OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY
SAID I WELL THE EXPENSE WAS NOT A VERY HEAVY ONE HE RETORTED I HAVE BEEN MERELY CONSUMING A BY PRODUCT OF YOUR MENTAL ACTIVITY HALLO THAT'S ANSTEY ALREADY A PECULIAR KNOCK APPARENTLY DELIVERED WITH THE HANDLE OF A WALKING STICK ON THE OUTER DOOR
AND ESPECIALLY FROM THE DEGRADATION OF BEING LOCKED UP IN A JAIL HE EXCLAIMED REGRETFULLY AS WE WALKED DOWN THE STREET THERE IS SURELY NO DEGRADATION IN BEING MERELY ACCUSED OF A CRIME I ANSWERED WITHOUT MUCH CONVICTION HOWEVER IT MAY HAPPEN TO THE BEST OF US
THIS WAS THE QUESTION THAT I HAD DREADED AND NOW THAT I HAD TO ANSWER IT I CLEARED MY THROAT AND BENT MY GAZE NERVOUSLY ON THE FLOOR THE MAGISTRATE REFUSED BAIL I SAID AFTER AN UNCOMFORTABLE PAUSE WELL
BESIDES I WAS JEOPARDISING NO ONE'S HAPPINESS BUT MY OWN AND A MAN MAY DO AS HE PLEASES WITH HIS OWN HAPPINESS NO EVEN THORNDYKE COULD NOT ACCUSE ME OF DISHONOURABLE CONDUCT PRESENTLY MY THOUGHTS TOOK A FRESH TURN
ANSTEY IS A WAG YOU UNDERSTAND EXPLAINED THORNDYKE BUT HE HAS LUCID INTERVALS HE'LL HAVE ONE PRESENTLY IF WE ARE PATIENT PATIENT SNORTED OUR ECCENTRIC VISITOR
THE HORSES CAME STAMPING AND SLIDING STRAIGHT ON TO ME AND BEFORE I COULD WRIGGLE OUT OF THE WAY THE HOOF OF ONE OF THEM SMASHED IN MY HAT THAT WAS A NEW ONE THAT I CAME HOME IN AND HALF STUNNED ME THEN THE NEAR WHEEL STRUCK MY HEAD MAKING A DIRTY LITTLE SCALP WOUND AND PINNED DOWN MY SLEEVE SO THAT I COULDN'T PULL AWAY MY ARM
MUST SEE WHO IT IS I SUPPOSE HE CONTINUED THOUGH ONE EXPECTS PEOPLE TO ACCEPT THE HINT OF A CLOSED OAK HE STRODE ACROSS THE ROOM AND FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR WITH AN AIR OF BY NO MEANS GRACIOUS INQUIRY IT'S RATHER LATE FOR A BUSINESS CALL
FOR HAVING BEEN SO EXPLICIT AND EMPHATIC MY UNCLE'S CONDITION WALTER RESUMED AFTER A PAUSE IS A PRETTY MISERABLE ONE AT PRESENT WITH THIS HORRIBLE AFFAIR ADDED TO HIS OWN PERSONAL WORRIES HAS HE ANY SPECIAL TROUBLE BESIDES THIS THEN
AT THIS MOMENT POLTON MADE A SILENT APPEARANCE ON THE STAIRS LEADING FROM THE LABORATORY GIVING ME QUITE A START AND I WAS ABOUT TO RETIRE INTO THE ROOM WHEN MY EAR CAUGHT THE TINKLE OF A HANSOM APPROACHING FROM PAPER BUILDINGS
A QUEER AFFAIR JERVIS A VERY ODD AFFAIR INDEED I WAS COMING UP FROM THE BOROUGH PICKING MY WAY MIGHTY CAREFULLY ACROSS THE ROAD ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREASY SLIPPERY MUD AND HAD JUST REACHED THE FOOT OF LONDON BRIDGE WHEN I HEARD A HEAVY LORRY COMING DOWN THE SLOPE A GOOD DEAL TOO FAST
I ROUSED MYSELF FROM MY REVERIE WITH A LAUGH AT THORNDYKE'S QUAINT CONCEIT AND A GLANCE AT THE GROTESQUELY DISTORTED REFLECTION OF MY FACE IN THE POLISHED SILVER I AM AFRAID I HAVE BEEN A RATHER DULL COMPANION THIS MORNING I ADMITTED APOLOGETICALLY
WHILE THE STRANGE DECEPTIVE ASPECT THAT IT LENT TO FAMILIAR OBJECTS AND THE OBLITERATION OF LANDMARKS MADE MY PROGRESS SO SLOW
YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO REUBEN AT HOLLOWAY HE WILL BE ORDERED ABOUT BY WARDERS WILL HAVE A NUMBER LABEL FASTENED ON TO HIS COAT HE WILL BE LOCKED IN A CELL WITH A SPY HOLE IN THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH ANY PASSING STRANGER MAY WATCH HIM HIS FOOD WILL BE HANDED TO HIM IN A TIN PAN
THE HEAVY DOOR SWUNG OUTWARDS AND DISCLOSED A BAIZE COVERED INNER DOOR WHICH THORNDYKE PUSHED OPEN AND HELD FOR ME TO PASS IN YOU WILL FIND MY CHAMBERS AN ODD MIXTURE SAID THORNDYKE FOR THEY COMBINE THE ATTRACTIONS OF AN OFFICE A MUSEUM A LABORATORY AND A WORKSHOP
BUT STRAINED AND WILD IN EXPRESSION AND DISPLAYING HIS UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION BY CONTINUAL NERVOUS MOVEMENTS WHICH CONTRASTED CURIOUSLY WITH THE COMPOSED DEMEANOUR OF THE ACCUSED MAN NEVERTHELESS HE GAVE HIS EVIDENCE IN A PERFECTLY CONNECTED MANNER
FROM THE GREAT FINGER PRINT OBSESSION WHICH HAS POSSESSED THE LEGAL MIND EVER SINCE GALTON PUBLISHED HIS EPOCH MAKING MONOGRAPH IN THAT WORK I REMEMBER HE STATES THAT A FINGER PRINT AFFORDS EVIDENCE REQUIRING NO CORROBORATION A MOST DANGEROUS AND MISLEADING STATEMENT
I SHOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT TAKES PLACE AT ANY RATE I SAID AND WE ACCORDINGLY SALLIED FORTH TOGETHER IN THE DIRECTION OF LINCOLN'S INN ON THE NORTH SIDE OF WHICH MISTER LAWLEY'S OFFICE WAS SITUATED AH SAID THE SOLICITOR AS WE ENTERED
HOW IS THAT I ASKED
THE CONCLUSIONS TO WHICH MY COGITATIONS AT LENGTH BROUGHT ME WERE FIRST THAT I WAS AN EGOTISTICAL DONKEY AND SECOND THAT MY RELATIONS WITH MISS GIBSON WERE OF AN EXCLUSIVELY BUSINESS CHARACTER AND MUST IN FUTURE
IN THAT CASE SAID THORNDYKE LET US DRAW OUR CHAIRS UP TO THE FIRE AND FALL TO BUSINESS FORTHWITH
FOR WE ARE DUE AT LAWLEY'S AT HALF PAST TEN IS JERVIS COMING WITH US YES YOU'D BETTER COME SAID THORNDYKE IT'S THE ADJOURNED HEARING OF POOR HORNBY'S CASE YOU KNOW THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING DONE ON OUR SIDE
FOR YOU WERE ALWAYS A DEUCE OF A WORKER TO SAY NOTHING OF YOUR CAPABILITIES YES I WORKED HARD REPLIED THORNDYKE AND I WORK HARD STILL BUT I HAVE MY HOURS OF LABOUR AND MY HOURS OF LEISURE
WHERE WE WERE CONFRONTED BY A MASSIVE DOOR ABOVE WHICH MY FRIEND'S NAME WAS WRITTEN IN WHITE LETTERS RATHER A FORBIDDING EXTERIOR REMARKED THORNDYKE AS HE INSERTED THE LATCHKEY BUT IT IS HOMELY ENOUGH INSIDE
AND I THANK YOU FROM MY HEART AND AS TO THIS PRESENT MISFORTUNE I CONTINUED
IN HOLLOWAY PRISON SHE LOOKED ME STONILY IN THE FACE FOR SOME SECONDS PALE AND WIDE EYED BUT SILENT THEN WITH A SUDDEN CATCH IN HER BREATH SHE TURNED AWAY
AND IN WHOSE BEHALF ITS INEXORABLE MACHINERY HAS BEEN SET IN MOTION THE PRESIDING MAGISTRATE EMOTIONLESS AND DRY DIPPED HIS PEN WHILE REUBEN WHO HAD SURRENDERED TO HIS BAIL
BY SPECIAL FAVOUR OF THE AUTHORITIES REUBEN WAS TO BE ALLOWED TO MAKE HIS JOURNEY TO HOLLOWAY IN A CAB THUS ESCAPING THE HORRORS OF THE FILTHY AND VERMINOUS PRISON VAN AND WHILE THIS WAS BEING PROCURED HIS FRIENDS WERE PERMITTED TO WISH HIM FAREWELL
IN ITS WIG AND OBSOLETE HABILIMENTS TO THE OLD WORLD SURROUNDINGS THAT IT SEEMED TO COMPLETE THE PICTURE AND I LINGERED IDLY TO LOOK AT IT THE BARRISTER HAD HALTED IN THE DOORWAY TO TURN OVER A SHEAF OF PAPERS THAT HE HELD IN HIS HAND AND AS HE REPLACED THE RED TAPE WHICH BOUND THEM TOGETHER
RESUMED HIS VIGIL ON THE DOORSTEP FROM THIS COIGN OF VANTAGE HE RETURNED AFTER A TIME TO TAKE AWAY THE TEA THINGS AND THEREAFTER
THE LITTLE MAN EVIDENTLY PERCEIVED MY STATE OF MIND FOR HE STOLE AWAY SILENTLY LEAVING ME RATHER PENITENT AND ASHAMED
RATHER FOXY IN APPEARANCE AND OF A TYPICALLY LEGAL ASPECT AND THE OTHER A FINE HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW OF VERY PREPOSSESSING EXTERIOR
AND IT IS SO HORRIBLE AND ABOVE ALL SO DREADFULLY SUGGESTIVE OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN UP TO NOW THE WHOLE THING HAS SEEMED LIKE A NIGHTMARE TERRIFYING BUT YET UNREAL BUT NOW THAT HE IS ACTUALLY IN PRISON IT HAS SUDDENLY BECOME A DREADFUL REALITY AND I AM OVERWHELMED WITH TERROR
AS THOUGH IT APOLOGISED FOR BREAKING THE STUDIOUS SILENCE
AND SLIPPED IT INTO THE SAFE AS A SURE MEANS OF DIVERTING SUSPICION ALL THIS WAS IMPROBABLE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE
DETAINED BY THE FOG I EXPECT IT MUST BE PRETTY THICK IN THE BOROUGH I MAY MENTION THAT TO POLTON THORNDYKE WAS THE DOCTOR OTHER INFERIOR CREATURES THERE WERE INDEED TO WHOM THE TITLE OF DOCTOR IN A WAY APPERTAINED
BUT FORTUNATELY A GLIMMER OF SENSE RESTRAINED ME SHE WILL FIND HIM DRY ENOUGH YES I DISLIKE HIM EXTREMELY DO YOU KNOW THAT HE HAD THE IMPUDENCE TO ADVISE REUBEN TO PLEAD GUILTY HE TOLD US HE HAD DONE SO
BE CONDUCTED ON THAT BASIS WITH THE ADDED CONSIDERATION THAT I WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL AGENT FOR THE TIME BEING OF REUBEN HORNBY AND IN HONOUR BOUND TO REGARD HIS INTERESTS AS PARAMOUNT I AM HOPING SAID THORNDYKE
AND CHEAP TRAVELLING TOO WE RESERVE OUR DEFENCE I SUPPOSE YOU AGREE TO THAT I SUPPOSE SO THE MAGISTRATE IS SURE TO COMMIT UNLESS YOU HAVE AN UNQUESTIONABLE ALIBI
THE ACTUAL POINTS AT ISSUE THEN I SAID ARE WHETHER REUBEN HAD ANY MEANS OF OPENING THE SAFE AND WHETHER MISTER HORNBY EVER DID ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF OBTAINING REUBEN'S THUMB MARK IN BLOOD ON HIS MEMORANDUM BLOCK
THOUGH VERY DISREPUTABLE TO LOOK AT JUST CAME A CROPPER IN THE MUD JERVIS HE ADDED AS HE NOTED MY DISMAYED EXPRESSION DINNER AND A CLOTHES BRUSH ARE WHAT I CHIEFLY NEED NEVERTHELESS HE LOOKED VERY PALE AND SHAKEN WHEN HE CAME INTO THE LIGHT ON THE LANDING
BUT THE YOUNG MAN INTERRUPTED ME PRAY DON'T GO AWAY ON MY ACCOUNT HE SAID THE FACTS THAT I AM ABOUT TO LAY BEFORE DOCTOR THORNDYKE
TAKING UP ANY SMALL APPOINTMENTS THAT WERE GOING ASSISTANT DEMONSTRATOR OR CURATORSHIPS AND SUCH LIKE HUNG ABOUT THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL LABORATORIES THE MUSEUM AND POST MORTEM ROOM AND MEANWHILE TOOK MY M D
UNLIKE YOU POOR DEVILS OF GENERAL PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE LIABLE TO BE DRAGGED AWAY FROM THE DINNER TABLE
NO THORNDYKE IS A MAN WHO PLAYS A SINGLE HANDED GAME
JOHN HORNBY WAS CALLED I GLANCED TOWARDS THE WITNESS BOX WITH NO LITTLE CURIOSITY I HAD NOT HITHERTO MET MISTER HORNBY AND AS HE NOW ENTERED THE BOX I SAW AN ELDERLY MAN TALL FLORID AND WELL PRESERVED
AT THE TOP OF MIDDLE TEMPLE LANE WE PARTED THORNDYKE TAKING HIS WAY WITH FLUTTERING GOWN TOWARDS THE LAW COURTS
THOUGH THERE I'LL WAGER THE COFFEE POT WAS EVEN WITH YOU
STOOD ERECT AND MOTIONLESS AS FIGURES IN STONE WHILE THE BIER OF THE DEAD WAS BEING CARRIED THROUGH OPEN RANKS TO THE WAITING CAISSON THE COFFIN WAS COVERED WITH A FLAG AND UPON IT LAY HIS CHAPEAU GAUNTLETS SASH AND SWORD
THE BELL RANG I FOLLOWED TO THE RECITATION HALL AND WAS ASSIGNED A SEAT BELOW THE REST BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY SMALL SONOMA GIRL YET ENROLLED I MADE SEVERAL LIFE LONG FRIENDS AT THAT INSTITUTE
AND RENDER ALL POSSIBLE AID TOWARD THE IMMEDIATE RESCUE OF THE SNOW BOUND
GRANDMA DECIDED TO LEND IT A HELPING HAND BY SENDING HER A TERM AS A DAY SCHOLAR MY DELIGHTED SISTER WAS SOON IN TOUCH WITH A CROWD OF OTHER LITTLE GIRLS AND BROUGHT HOME MANY OF THEIR BRIGHT SAYINGS FOR MY EDIFICATION
GRANDMA BELIEVING THAT I HAD GONE TO SCHOOL LONG ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO FINISH MY STUDIES WITHOUT TEACHERS GEORGIA WAS MORE FORTUNATE WHEN MISS HUTCHINSON OPENED THE YOUNG LADIES SEMINARY IN THE FALL
BEFORE WE COULD BRING UP THE LAGGARDS THAT PROVOKINGLY DAWDLED ALONG NIBBLING STRAY BUNCHES OF GRASS WHEN LATE ON THE ROAD WE SAW COYOTES SNEAKING OUT FOR THEIR EVENING MEAL AND HEARD THE FAR AWAY CRY OF THE PANTHER
GRANDPA BROUGHT THE NEWS HOME CALIFORNIA IS OURS THERE WILL BE NO MORE WAR NO MORE TROUBLE AND NO MORE NEED OF SOLDIERS YET THE WOMEN FELT THAT THEIR BATTLES AND TRIALS HAD JUST BEGUN
RODE TO JOHNSON'S RANCH AND ALL THINGS BEING READY HE APPOINTED RACINE TUCKER CAPTAIN OF THE COMPANY AND IN TOUCHING WORDS COMMENDED THE HEROIC WORK OF ITS MEMBERS AND BADE THEM GODSPEED ON THEIR ERRAND OF MERCY
TO HASTEN RECRUITS FOR SERVICE CAPTAIN SUTTER
WOMEN LEFT THE ROOM SOBBING AND MEN CALLED THOSE PASSING IN FROM THE STREET TO JOIN THE KNOTS OF EARNEST TALKERS ALL WERE READY AND WILLING TO DO BUT ALAS THE OBSTACLES WHICH HAD PREVENTED MISTER REED GETTING MEN FOR THE MOUNTAIN WORK
TURKEY CHICKEN AND WILD DUCK AT THE ENDS A WHOLE ROASTED PIG IN THE CENTRE AND MORE THAN ENOUGH DELICIOUS ACCOMPANIMENTS TO COVER THE SPACES BETWEEN THEN THE GROWN FOLK DINING FIRST AND THE FLOCK OF HUNGRY CHILDREN COMING LATER
OF THE SNOW WHITE POODLE SNUGGLED CLOSE IN THE EMPRESS'S ARMS THEN SHE TOLD HOW SHE HEARD A HEAVY THUD BY THE KITCHEN FIRE WHICH MADE HER RUSH BACK ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THE HEAD COOK HAD FALLEN TO THE FLOOR IN A FAINT
AND BLOOD CURDLING EDITORIALS INCREASED PUBLIC SENTIMENT AGAINST KESEBERG STAMPING HIM WITH THE MARK OF CAIN AND CLOSING THE DOOR OF EVERY HOME AGAINST HIM
AND ADOLPH BRENHEIM GAVE UP AND TURNED BACK MISTER TUCKER FEARING THAT OTHERS MIGHT BECOME DISHEARTENED AND DO LIKEWISE GUARANTEED EACH MAN WHO WOULD PERSEVERE TO THE END FIVE DOLLARS PER DIEM
SOMETIMES SHE WOULD LET US BRING HER FROM UNDER THE SOFA HER GORGEOUS PRINTS ILLUSTRATING WILHELM TELL AND WOULD REPEAT THE TEXT RELATING TO THE SCENES AS WE EXAMINED EACH PICTURE WITH EAGER INTEREST
NOT A SOUL WAS IN SIGHT WHEN WE STARTED TOWARD THE FORT ALL UNCONSCIOUS OF WHAT THE INEVITABLE IS TO BE WAS WEAVING INTO OUR LIVES
INTENSE EXCITEMENT AND INDIGNATION PREVAILED AT THE FORT AFTER CAPTAIN FALLON AND OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY GAVE THEIR ACCOUNT OF THE CONDITIONS FOUND AT THE MOUNTAIN CAMPS AND OF INTERVIEWS HAD WITH KESEBERG WHOM THEY NOW CALLED CANNIBAL
WHILE THE EARLY SUNLIGHT OF JANUARY NINETEENTH WAS FLOODING HIS ROOM WITH CHEER AND WARMTH HE DICTATED A LETTER TO MISTER JOHN SINCLAIR
THE SLEEVES SMALL AT THE WRIST WERE TRIMMED WITH FOLDS OF THE MATERIAL AND A QUILLING OF WHITE LACE AT THE HAND ON THE ALL IMPORTANT MORNING GRANDMA WAS ANXIOUS THAT I SHOULD LOOK WELL
ONE WAS OUR PRETTY MISS SALLIE LEWIS WHO HAD THE DREAD DISEASE IN CONFLUENT FORM GRANDMA WAS CALLED HURRIEDLY IN THE NIGHT BECAUSE THE AFFLICTED GIRL IN DELIRIUM HAD LOOSENED THE STRAPS WHICH HELD HER UPON HER BED
I WOULD RUSH OFF ALONE AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS TO GET AWAY FROM THE TORTURING SYMPATHY EVEN THERE I MET THOSE WHO WOULD LOOK AT ME WITH GREAT SERIOUS EYES SHAKE THEIR HEADS AND MOURNFULLY SAY YOU POOR LITTLE MITE
NOTICED HIS AFFECTION FOR THAT SORROWING GIRL WHO IS TOO PRETTY TO BE IN THIS NEW COUNTRY WITHOUT A PROTECTOR THEY ALSO RECALLED HOW PERRY MC COON'S LAUNCH HAD BROUGHT SUPPLIES UP THE RIVER FOR THE SECOND RELIEF TO TAKE OVER THE MOUNTAINS
WHO HAD ALREADY TWICE SENT SUPPLIES FIRST BY STANTON AND AGAIN BY MC CUTCHEN AND REED IN THEIR UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE MOUNTAINS
AND AS IT CAME TIME FOR THE FUNERAL WE GATHERED WITH OTHERS ON THE PLAZA WHERE THE PROCESSION FORMED WE WERE DEEPLY IMPRESSED THE EMIGRANTS UNCOVERED AND BOWED THEIR HEADS REVERENTLY BUT THE SOLDIERS IN LINE WITH GUNS REVERSED
PUNCTIONS AND QUALITY FOLKS I REPEATED THEM OVER AND OVER TO MYSELF SO THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL THEM TO GEORGIA OUR LAST VISIT TO AUNT LUCY MUST HAVE BEEN PREARRANGED FOR AS SHE ADMITTED US SHE SAID
STILL IT WAS EASY TO SEE THAT SAINT MARY'S HALL WAS ESTABLISHED FOR PUPILS WHO HAD BEEN REARED IN THE LAP OF WEALTH AND EASE NOT FOR THOSE WHOSE HANDS WERE ROUGH LIKE MINE NOR WAS THERE A CLASS FOR ME
ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE NICER WAYS OF WORK AND LADYLIKE ACCOMPLISHMENTS SHE COULD SEE NO HARM IN GEORGIA WISHING TO REMAIN AN AMERICAN SINCE TO LOVE ONE'S OWN PEOPLE AND COUNTRY WAS NATURAL THEREAFTER GRANDMA CHANGED HER METHODS
KNOWN TO HUMAN NATURE SOME OF THE LISTENERS HAD PARTED FROM MEMBERS OF THE DONNER PARTY AT THE LITTLE SANDY WHEN ITS PROSPECTS APPEARED SO BRIGHT AND THE MISFORTUNES WHICH HAD SINCE BEFALLEN THE PARTY SEEMED INCREDIBLE
WHO HAD BEEN AMONG THE EARLY GOLD SEEKERS AND TRIED ROUGHING IT IN THE MINES THOUGH A NATIVE OF RHODE ISLAND AND OF PURITAN ANCESTRY HE WAS QUITE WESTERN IN APPEARANCE THOUGH NOT A WEALTHY MAN
AFTER THE LAWYER WENT AWAY GRANDMA TOLD US THAT JAKIE HAD WILLED US EACH FIFTY DOLLARS IN GOLD AND THE REST OF HIS PROPERTY TO GRANDPA AND HERSELF A FEW WEEKS LATER WHEN THE SAP CEASED FLOWING TO THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES AND THE YELLOW LEAVES WERE FALLING
CAPTAIN FRISBIE SPENT MUCH TIME IN SONOMA AFTER COMPANY H WAS DISBANDED AND OBSERVING ONES REMARKED THAT THE ATTRACTION WAS MISS FANNIE VALLEJO YET NOT UNTIL EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE DID THE GENERAL CONSENT TO PART WITH HIS FIRST BORN DAUGHTER
THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE GEORGIA AND ME VACCINATED WHILE THE EPIDEMIC PREVAILED INSISTING THAT IF WE SHOULD TAKE THE DISEASE SHE COULD NURSE US THROUGH IT WITHOUT DISFIGUREMENT AND WE WOULD THENCEFORTH BE IMMUNE SHE DID NOT EXPOSE US DURING WHAT SHE TERMED THE CATCHING STAGE
FOR I HAD A VIVID RECOLLECTION OF THE GRAND DINNER GIVEN IN COMMEMORATION OF OUR VERY FIRST LEGALLY APPOINTED THANKSGIVING DAY IN CALIFORNIA I HAD ONLY TO CLOSE MY EYES AND IN THOUGHT WOULD REAPPEAR THE LONGEST AND MOST BOUNTIFULLY SPREAD TABLE I HAD EVER SEEN
HE SAW NO WHITE FACES UNTIL HE REACHED SINCLAIR'S WHERE THE LETTER CREATED A PAINFUL INTEREST AND WON READY PROMISES OF HELP IT WAS DARK WHEN HE REACHED SUTTER'S FORT NEVERTHELESS FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE HE SPREAD THE STARTLING REPORT
AND EMPRESS WOULD ARRIVE IN THAT TOWN AND DINE AT THE TAVERN THEN THE EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASTIC PREPARATIONS WHICH FOLLOWED
AND SOME IN THEIR EAGERNESS FORGOT TO ROLL DOWN THEIR SLEEVES BEFORE THEY BEGAN TO TALK ONE TRIUMPHANTLY REPEATED TO EACH NEWCOMER THE MOTHERLY ADVICE WHICH SHE GAVE THE YOUNG COUPLE WHEN SHE FIRST
THEN TWIST A LUMP OF BUTTER INTO A SQUARE OF FINE MUSLIN AND DEFTLY SQUEEZE UNTIL IT CRINKLED THROUGH THE MESHES IN FORM OF FLEECE FOR THE LAMB'S COAT
HE STATED THAT MISSUS MURPHY HAD DIED OF STARVATION SOON AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE THIRD RELIEF AND THAT MY MOTHER HAD WATCHED BY FATHER'S BEDSIDE UNTIL HE DIED
BUT AS YET HAD OBTAINED NOTHING
DRIVING PACK ANIMALS WELL LADEN WITH WARM CLOTHING BLANKETS AND FOOD SUPPLIES LEFT THE FORT AT SUNRISE ON THE MORNING OF FEBRUARY THE FIRST AND ON THE THIRD REACHED JOHNSON'S RANCH
DATING FROM THE TIME THE PARTY ENTERED THE SNOW THE REMAINING SEVEN PUSHED AHEAD AND ON THE EIGHTEENTH
HER HUSBAND DESPATCHED AN OPEN LETTER TO THE PEOPLE OF SAN FRANCISCO DESCRIBING THE ARRIVAL
CHAPTER TWENTY NINE GREAT SMALLPOX EPIDEMIC SAINT MARY'S HALL THANKSGIVING DAY IN CALIFORNIA ANOTHER BROTHER IN LAW MISSUS BRUNNER HAS BECOME TOO CHILDISH TO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF YOUNG GIRLS
WHEN READY TO MOUNT HE SHOOK HANDS WITH EACH MAN AND RECORDED THE NAMES IN A NOTE BOOK AS FOLLOWS
THE FIRST RELIEF DECIDED TO PRESERVE ITS SUPPLIES FOR THE RETURN TRIP BY HANGING THEM IN PARCELS FROM ROPES
I BEGAN TO SEE THAT THERE WERE CONSIDERABLE SOUND STRETCHES AND TOOK HEART I HAD WITH ME LAND CHARTS AND COMPASS BUT NOTHING FOR TAKING ALTITUDE OBSERVATIONS FOR THE SPERANZA INSTRUMENTS EXCEPT ONE COMPASS HAD ALL BEEN BROKEN UP BY HER SHOCK
OUR ONLY CARE BEING TO HIDE OUR POOR COWERING BODIES AS DEEPLY AND DARKLY AS POSSIBLE ONCE I PASSED THROUGH A CITY ADRIANOPLE DOUBLY DEVASTATED ONCE BY THE HELLISH ARSON OF MY OWN HAND AND ONCE BY THE EARTHQUAKE
BUT FOR SHAME WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD OF A SUBORDINATE POST ON BOARD ON THE THIRD SUNDAY NIGHT OF HIS DENUNCIATION I WAS THERE IN THAT KENSINGTON CHAPEL AND I HEARD HIM
A WILD BUT FAINT LUMINOSITY MINGLED WITH STARS AND FLASHES OF BRILLIANCE THE WHOLE TROOPING UNANIMOUSLY EASTWARD AS IF IN HASTE WITH ELFIN MOMENTOUS PURPOSE A BOUNDLESS CONGREGATION IN THE SWEEP OF A STRONG OCEANIC CURRENT
IT WAS NOW THAT WE BEGAN TO ENCOUNTER A SUCCESSION OF STRANGE LOOKING OBJECTS LYING SCATTERED OVER THE ICE WHOSE NUMBER CONTINUALLY INCREASED AS WE PROCEEDED THEY HAD THE APPEARANCE OF ROCKS OR PIECES OF IRON
AND TURNED THE LEAVES OF A BOOK WITHOUT READING WE WERE SILENT SHE AND I I STANDING LOOKING AT HER SHE DRAWING THE THUMB ACROSS THE LEAF EDGES AND BEGINNING AGAIN CONTEMPLATIVELY
AND I SMILED A SMILE THAT NEVER YET MAN SMILED AND I SAID I WILL BURN I WILL BURN I WILL RETURN TO LONDON WHILE I WAS ON THIS EASTWARD JOURNEY STOPPING FOR THE NIGHT AT THE TOWN OF SWINDON
BUT I WAS SAYING THAT WHEN CLARK LEFT ME I WAS DRAWING ON MY GLOVES TO GO TO SEE MY FIANCEE THE COUNTESS CLODAGH WHEN I HEARD THE TWO VOICES MOST CLEARLY SOMETIMES THE URGENCY OF ONE OR OTHER IMPULSE IS SO OVERPOWERING
ONE WINDY DARK EVENING ABOUT EIGHT WHERE I ALIGHTED AND WALKED TO EUSTON ROAD THEN EASTWARD ALONG IT TILL I CAME TO A SHOP WHICH I KNEW TO BE A JEWELLER'S THOUGH IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE ANY PAINTED WORDS THE DOOR TO MY ANNOYANCE WAS LOCKED
BEYOND DOUBT CURSED NOT MEANT TO BE PENETRATED BY MAN AND RAPID AND AWFUL WAS THE DEGENERATION OF OUR SOULS AS FOR ME
THOUGH A NIGHTMARE OF RICH HAPPINESS IF ONE MAY SAY SO LEAVING ON THE MEMORY A VAGUE VAST IMPRESSION OF MONSTROUS RAVINES EVER SUCCEEDING PROFUNDITIES HEIGHTS AND GREATNESSES JUNGLES STRANGE AS SOME MOON STRUCK POET'S FANTASY
MARSEILLES FISHERS A MALTESE SPERONARE AMERICAN OFF SHORE SAIL MISSISSIPPI STEAM BOATS SORRENTO LUG SCHOONERS RHINE PUNTS YAWLS
IN THE SECOND STARBOARD BERTH WAS A SMALL TABLE AND ON THE FLOOR A THICK ROUND INK POT WHOSE CONTINUAL ROLLING ON ITS SIDE MADE ME LOOK DOWN AND THERE I SAW A FLAT SQUARE BOOK WITH BLACK COVERS WHICH CURVED HALF OPEN OF ITSELF FOR IT HAD BEEN WET AND STAINED
SO AS SOON AS THE WIND ALLOWED US TO HUDDLE TOGETHER OUR SCATTERED THINGS WE CRAWLED INTO THE SLEEPING BAGS AND INSTANTLY SLEPT WE KNEW THAT THE ICE WAS IN AWFUL UPHEAVAL AROUND US WE HEARD AS OUR EYELIDS SWEETLY CLOSED THE SLOW BOOMING OF DISTANT GUNS
AND SHE WAS A BUT TELL ME FIRST CRIES SHE HOW DID ONE KNOW ONE'S LOVER OR ONE'S WIFE FLOM ALL THE OTHERS WELL BY THEIR FACES BUT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY FACES ALL ALIKE
THE SEA SMOOTH AND PALE WITH THE SMOOTH PALLOR OF STRONG CURRENTS THE SHIP STILL ENOUGH NO LAND IN SIGHT YET GREAT TRACTS OF SEA WEED MAKING EASTWARD
FROM BOWSPRIT TIP TO POOP AND FROM BULWARKS TO WATER LINE STOUT AS A HEDGEHOG ONLY AWAITING THERE THE NEXT HIGH SEA TO FOUNDER IT BEING NEAR MY DINNER HOUR AND NIGHT'S REST I STOPPED THE SPERANZA SOME FIFTEEN YARDS FROM HER
HIS DISAPPEARANCE HAD BEEN EXPLAINED BY A HUNDRED DIFFERENT GUESSES ON THE SHIP ALL PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH I HAD NO IDEA THAT ANYONE CONNECTED ME IN ANY WAY WITH HIS DEATH
AND LIKE THE MOON IT IS A THING OF MUCH BEAUTY AND MANY MOODS SUGGESTING A CREATURE UNDER THE SPELL OF CHARMS AND MAGICS HOWEVER WITH THIS IDEA OF VAUCLAIRE STILL IN MY HEAD
I FOUND IT VERY AFFECTING AND THE DESCRIPTION GOOD ONLY I SAW NO SEVEN RINGS AND WHERE HE SPEAKS OF THE PALE AND LIVID LIGHT HE SHOULD SPEAK RATHER OF THE DUN AND BROWNISH GLOOM FOR THE WORD LIGHT DISCONCERTS THE FANCY
INSTINCTIVELY DAFTLY BRUTISHLY
AND THE BONES OF YOUR MOTHER AND YOU CAN FEEL THE BONES IN YOUR FINGERS YOUR FINGERS WILL BECOME MERE BONE AFTER YOU ARE DEAD AS DIE YOU MUST THOSE BONES WHICH YOU SEE AROUND YOU ARE OF COURSE THE BONES OF THE MEN OF WHOM WE OFTEN SPEAK
AND THE THIRD WAS I DECIDED AN OLD JEW OF THE POLISH PALE IN GABERDINE AND SKULL CAP WITH EAR LOCKS I WENT NEARER TO WHERE THEY LAY THICK AS REAPED STUBBLE BETWEEN THE QUAY AND A LITTLE STONE FOUNTAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPACE
THE CHIEF OF THE COMING EXPEDITION A MERE VISIT OF FRIENDSHIP
WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE FIRST HOUSE ROW AND THE QUAY WHAT I SAW WAS NOT ONLY MOST WOEFUL BUT WILDLY STARTLING WOEFUL BECAUSE A GREAT CROWD OF PEOPLE HAD ASSEMBLED AND LAY DEAD THERE
FOR THE ABSTRACT INTEREST WHICH MANKIND IN MERE DESIRE FOR KNOWLEDGE HAD ALWAYS FELT IN THIS UNKNOWN REGION WAS NOW SUDDENLY A THOUSAND AND A THOUSAND TIMES INTENSIFIED
FOR WILSON TOOK UP THE DEPOSITED MEDICINE GLASS ELEVATED IT LOOKED AT IT SMELLED INTO IT AND HE DID IT WITH A KIND OF HURRIED LIGHT FINGERED STEALTH AND HE DID IT WITH AN UNDER LOOK AND A MEANINGNESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH
AND A LONG TIME I LAY SO GRADUALLY BECOMING CONSCIOUS OF A SLOW DRIPPING AT ONE SPOT IN THE CAVE FOR AT A MINUTE'S INTERVAL IT DARKLY SPLASHED REGULARLY VERY DELIBERATELY AND IT SEEMED TO GROW ALWAYS LOUDER AND SADDER
AND HALF ACROSS THE BARE KNEES OF A HIGHLAND SOLDIER I FLEW WITH A SHOWER OF KICKS UPON THE FOOLISH THING BUT THAT BOOTED NOTHING
I WAS AT THE ONE CALLED IN THE CHART SADDLE HILL THE SMALLEST OF THEM I THINK AND SELDOM HAVE I HAD SUCH SENSATIONS OF PEACE AS I LAY A WHOLE BURNING DAY IN A RISING VALE DEEPLY SHADED IN PALM AND TROPICAL RANKNESSES
TO PITCH AND ROLL VIOLENTLY AND THE SEA A MOMENT SINCE CALM IS NOW ROUGH AND AT THE SAME TIME THROUGH THE WHITE VAPOUR WE SEE A DARK SHADOW SLOWLY RISING
AND SO THE STLEAM WHICH BEGAN IN A LITTLE LONG ENDED IN A BIG LONG THE LONG GLOWING MORE AND MORE FIXED AND FATAL AS THE STLEAM LOLLED FURTHER FLOM THE SOURCE I SEE IT CLEARLY CAN'T YOU BUT NOW
WHO WOULD PREACH IN THE CATHEDRAL ON SUNDAY EVENINGS SO THEY COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IN AN ADJOINING ROOM SAT AN OLD DOCTOR AT A TABLE THE STETHOSCOPE TIPS STILL CLINGING IN HIS EARS
WE THUS FOUND THE RICHES WHICH WE SOUGHT BEYOND ALL DREAM BUT AS THE BEAR AND THE WALRUS FIND THEM FOR OURSELVES WE HAD LOST
NOR WILL I COME NEAR YOURS LATELY WE HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH TOGETHER BUT THEN WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE FULL OF PURPOSE AND OCCUPATION HERE WE SHALL BE NOTHING OF THE KIND I CAN SEE YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND AT ALL BUT THINGS ARE SO
THIS IS A CASE THAT I DISLIKE I HAVE HALF A MIND TO THROW IT TO THE DEVIL THEN DO SO AND YOU TOO GO HOME GO HOME CLODAGH BUT WHY IF ONE DOES NO HARM
IT WAS ALL VERY LEISURELY FOR NOT EVERYWHERE NOR EVERY DAY COULD I GET A NAUTICAL OBSERVATION AND HAVING AT ALL TIMES TO GO AT LOW PRESSURES FOR FEAR OF TUBE AND BOILER WEAKNESS CRAWLING THROUGH TUNNELS AND STOPPING WHEN TOTAL DARKNESS CAME ON WE DID NOT GO FAST
THAT AGONY OF STRIFE WITH WHICH THE BRAWLING VOICES SHOUTED THE ONE BE A SCIENTIST A DOCTOR AND THE OTHER BE A LAWYER AN ENGINEER AN ARTIST BE ANYTHING BUT A DOCTOR A DOCTOR I BECAME
TILL MY HEART WAS NEAR TO BREAK THE FEED PUMP ECCENTRIC SHAFT OF THIS ENGINE WHICH WAS VERY POOR AND FLAKY SUDDENLY GAVE OUT ABOUT FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON AND I HAD TO STOP IN A HURRY
HOW LOUD AND HOW EVER AND AGAIN I HEARD THEM CONTEND WITHIN ME WITH A NEARNESS
WE MUST LIVE PERFECTLY SEPARATE LIVES THEN YOU ARE NOTHING TO ME REALLY NOR I TO YOU ONLY WE LIVE ON THE SAME EARTH WHICH IS NOTHING AT ALL A MERE CHANCE YOUR OWN FOOD CLOTHES AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU WANT YOU WILL PROCURE FOR YOURSELF
I CAME UPON A LONELY HOUSE BY THE SEA A VERY BEAUTIFUL HOUSE MADE IT WAS CLEAR BY AN ARTIST OF THE BUNGALOW TYPE WITH AN EXQUISITELY SEA SIDE EXPRESSION
AND I TOOK HER DOWN THROUGH A BIG ROOM STACKED WITH EVERY KIND OF RIFLE WITH REVOLVERS CARTRIDGES POWDER SWORDS BAYONETS EVIDENTLY SOME OFFICIAL OR CANTONAL MAGAZINE
THEY WERE SET UPON BY THEIR ADVERSARIES AND ASSAILED SO FIERCELY THAT THREE WERE SLAIN OUTRIGHT AS TO THE FOURTH HE YET LIVED BUT ALTOGETHER MAULED AND SHAKEN FOR HIS THIGH WAS BROKEN AND A SPEAR HEAD REMAINED IN HIS SIDE
FOR SUCH WAS THE USAGE OF OUR FATHERS IN THE DAYS OF THIS TALE MILON GRIEVED SORELY AND MADE ANSWER THAT HE WOULD DO THE THING THE DAMSEL THOUGHT MOST SEEMLY TO BE DONE WHEN THE CHILD IS BORN REPLIED THE LADY
ALAS SAID THE LADY WHAT SHALL I DO I DOUBT THAT I AM LOST FOR MY LORD WILL FIND THAT HIS BRIDE IS NOT A MAID IF THIS BECOMES KNOWN THEY WILL MAKE ME A BONDWOMAN FOR ALL MY DAYS
MEETLY TO MOURN THE DEAD THERE RODE NIGH UPON TWO THOUSAND KNIGHTS WITH HAUBERKS UNLACED AND UNCOVERED HEADS PLUCKING UPON THEIR BEARDS SO THE FOUR LOVERS WERE PLACED EACH UPON HIS SHIELD AND BEING BROUGHT BACK IN HONOUR TO NANTES
THE DAMSEL STOOD UPON A TOWER TO WATCH THESE FEATS OF ARMS BY THEIR BLAZONED COATS AND SHIELDS SHE KNEW HER KNIGHTS SHE SAW THEIR MARVELLOUS DEEDS YET MIGHT NOT SAY WHO DID BEST NOR GIVE TO ONE THE PRAISE BUT THE TOURNAMENT WAS NO LONGER A SEEMLY AND ORDERED BATTLE
CONTEMNERS OF LOVE WHO DELIGHT THEMSELVES IN SADNESS BUT ENDURE IT I MUST FOR ALAS I KNOW NOT HOW TO DIE SO ON THE APPOINTED DAY THE LADY WAS WEDDED TO THE BARON
HIS HAIR AND BEARD SHOWED WHITE TO ALL AND THE VARLET WAS HEAVY TO LOOK ON HIM WHOM HE HAD OVERTHROWN HE CAUGHT THE DESTRIER BY THE BRIDLE AND LED HIM BEFORE THE STRICKEN MAN SIR SAID HE I PRAY YOU TO GET UPON YOUR HORSE
THE SON MADE ANSWER IN FAITH FAIR FATHER LET US RETURN TO OUR OWN LAND THERE I WILL SLAY THIS HUSBAND AND YOU SHALL YET BE MY MOTHER'S LORD
WHEN THE KNIGHT HEARD THESE WORDS HE MADE ANSWER VERY SWIFTLY LADY NAME IT NOT THE LAY OF THE FOUR SORROWS BUT RATHER THE LAY OF THE DOLOROUS KNIGHT WOULD YOU HEAR THE REASON WHY IT SHOULD BEAR THIS NAME
WITH MANY SHRILL CRIES AND FLUNG THE USELESS FLACKET FAR AWAY
MEN PRAISED HIS NAME IN WHATEVER REALM THEY TALKED OF GALLANT DEEDS IRELAND NORWAY AND WALES YEA FROM JUTLAND EVEN TO ALBANIA SINCE HE WAS PRAISED BY THE FRANK HE WAS THEREFORE ENVIED OF THE MEAN
I WILL GO TO HER THE MESSENGER BADE FAREWELL AND RETURNED TO HIS LADY HE PLACED THE RING IN HER HAND SAYING THAT HE HAD DONE HER WILL AS HE WAS BIDDEN TO DO RIGHT JOYOUS WAS THE DAMSEL TO KNOW THAT MILON'S LOVE WAS TENDER AS HER OWN
EACH CRIED HER NAME WITHIN THE LISTS NOW WHEN EASTERTIDE WAS COME A GREAT TOURNAMENT WAS PROCLAIMED TO BE HELD BEYOND THE WALLS OF NANTES THAT RICH CITY THE FOUR LOVERS WERE THE APPELLANTS IN THIS TOURNEY
WOULD NOT BE REFRESHED IN HEART AND BLOOD AND BONES SUCH VIRTUE HAD THIS MEDICINE DIRECTLY IT WERE DRUNKEN THIS SIMPLE SHE POURED WITHIN A LITTLE FLACKET
FOR HER PART THE LADY WAS SORE PERPLEXED AND CONSIDERED IN HER MIND VERY EARNESTLY WHICH OF THESE FOUR KNIGHTS SHE SHOULD TAKE AS FRIEND
NEVER WAS LADY OF MY PEERAGE HOWEVER FAIR AND GOOD AND GRACIOUS EVER LOVED BY FOUR SUCH VALIANT GENTLEMEN NOR EVER LOST THEM IN ONE SINGLE DAY SAVE YOU WHO WERE SO MAIMED AND IN SUCH PERIL ALL ARE GONE
THAT BY REASON OF HIS PROWESS HIS LIBERALITY AND HIS MODESTY MEN CALLED HIM THE KNIGHT PEERLESS SINCE THEY DID NOT KNOW HIS NAME THIS PRAISE OF THE GOOD KNIGHT AND OF HIS DEEDS CAME TO BE HEARD OF MILON
BUT HOW MIGHT LADY BEREAVE THREE OF LIFE SO AS TO CHERISH ONE EVEN NOW I CANNOT TELL FOR WHOM I HAVE MOST PITY OR WHO WAS CLOSEST TO MY MIND BUT THREE ARE DEAD AND ONE IS SORE STRICKEN NEITHER IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE WORLD WHICH CAN BRING ME COMFORT
THE SWAN IS FIT TO SERVE AT A ROYAL TABLE FOR THE BIRD IS PLUMP AS HE IS FAIR THE VARLET PUT THE SWAN IN HIS LADY'S HANDS SHE TOOK THE BIRD KINDLY AND SMOOTHING HIS HEAD AND NECK FELT THE LETTER THAT WAS HIDDEN BENEATH ITS FEATHERS
THE RANKS OF THE TWO COMPANIES WERE CONFUSED TOGETHER SO THAT EVERY MAN FOUGHT AGAINST HIS FELLOW
HE SWIFTLY RETURNED ON HIS STEPS AND THE FOWLER WITH HIM SO FURTIVELY WITHAL THAT THE LORDS WERE NOT DISTURBED AT THEIR GAME NOR PERCEIVED AUGHT OF THE MATTER THEY WENT THEREFORE TO THE CHAMBER OF THE LADY
AS FOR THE WOUNDED KNIGHT SHE COMMANDED HIM TO BE CARRIED TO HER OWN CHAMBER SHE SENT FOR SURGEONS AND GAVE HIM INTO THEIR HANDS THESE SEARCHED HIS WOUNDS SO SKILFULLY AND TENDED HIM WITH SO GREAT CARE THAT PRESENTLY HIS HURT COMMENCED TO HEAL
BECAUSE OF THE JOY HE HAD IN CLASPING HIS BURTHEN HE GAVE NO THOUGHT TO THE POTION BUT SHE SHE KNEW THE STRENGTH WAS FAILING IN HIS HEART FAIR FRIEND SAID SHE WELL I KNOW THAT YOU TIRE DRINK NOW I PRAY YOU OF THE FLACKET
WHO MIGHT NEVER WIN TOGETHER THERE WAS NO SPEECH BETWEEN THEM SAVE THAT CARRIED BY THE BIRD THEY CAUSED THE SWAN TO FAST FOR THREE DAYS AND THEN SENT HIM ON HIS ERRAND HE TO WHOM THE LETTER CAME SAW TO IT THAT THE MESSENGER WAS FED TO HEART'S DESIRE
PERCHANCE I MAY FIND YOU COMFORT FAIR FRIEND REPLIED SHE
SWEET TO HIS HEART WAS THE WRITING FOR THE LADY WROTE THAT WITHOUT HIM THERE WAS NO JOY IN HER LIFE AND SINCE IT WAS HIS DESIRE TO HEAR BY THE SWAN IT WOULD BE HER PLEASURE ALSO FOR TWENTY YEARS THE SWAN WAS MADE THE MESSENGER OF THESE TWO LOVERS
YET NEVER ONCE BY ANY KNIGHT HAVE I BEEN BORNE FROM MY HORSE THIS DAY I AM OVERTHROWN BY A BOY AND YET I CANNOT HELP BUT LOVE THEE THE VARLET ANSWERED
THEY RODE TO THEIR HOSTEL AND WITH THE KNIGHTS OF THEIR FELLOWSHIP PASSED THE HOURS IN MIRTH AND REVELRY MILON SPOKE TO THE LAD OF HIS MOTHER
SO GRACIOUS OF PERSON WAS THIS DAMSEL THAT THROUGHOUT THE REALM THERE WAS NO KNIGHT COULD REFRAIN FROM SETTING HIS HEART UPON HER THOUGH HE SAW HER BUT ONE ONLY TIME ALTHOUGH THE DEMOISELLE MIGHT NOT RETURN THE LOVE OF SO MANY CERTAINLY SHE HAD NO WISH TO SLAY THEM ALL
BUT WHEN THE KING CAME UPON THEM LIFELESS AND FAST IN THAT EMBRACE INCONTINENT HE FELL TO THE GROUND BEREFT OF SENSE AFTER HIS SPEECH HAD RETURNED TO HIM HE WAS PASSING HEAVY AND LAMENTED THEIR DOLEFUL CASE
SHE REQUIRED HER FRIEND TO COME FOR SPEECH WITHIN THE PRIVATE GARDEN OF HER HOUSE WHERE SHE WAS WONT TO TAKE HER DELIGHT MILON CAME AT HER COMMANDMENT HE CAME SO OFTEN AND SO DEARLY SHE LOVED HIM THAT IN THE END SHE GAVE HIM ALL THAT MAID MAY GIVE
ONLY THIS IS THERE TO DO TO GIVE THE SLAIN MEN SEEMLY BURIAL AND IF IT MAY BE TO HEAL THEIR COMRADE OF HIS WOUNDS SO BECAUSE OF HER GREAT LOVE AND NOBLENESS
THEIR SON HANDSELLED THEM TOGETHER AND GAVE THE MOTHER TO HIS SIRE
THE LAY OF THE TWO LOVERS ONCE UPON A TIME THERE LIVED IN NORMANDY TWO LOVERS WHO WERE PASSING FOND AND WERE BROUGHT BY LOVE TO DEATH THE STORY OF THEIR LOVE
THE LADY RECEIVED THEM COURTEOUSLY AS BECAME HER BREEDING SHE BROKE THE SEAL OF THE LETTER AND WHEN SHE WAS ASSURED OF WHAT WAS THEREIN MARVELLOUSLY SHE CHERISHED THE INFANT THESE HAVING BESTOWED THE BOY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR LORD'S COMMANDMENT RETURNED TO THEIR OWN LAND
THE OLDER KNIGHT SET HIMSELF OVER AGAINST THE CHAMPION AND THEY MET TOGETHER IN THE CENTRE OF THE FIELD MILON STRUCK HIS ADVERSARY SO FIERCELY THAT THE LANCE SPLINTERED IN HIS GAUNTLET BUT THE YOUNG KNIGHT KEPT HIS SEAT WITHOUT EVEN LOSING A STIRRUP
BUT MUST LOVE ME AS A SON AND EVER HOLD ME DEAR WHEN MILON HEARD THESE WORDS HE COULD ENDURE THEM NO FURTHER HE GOT HIM SWIFTLY FROM HIS HORSE AND TAKING THE LAD BY THE FRINGE OF HIS HAUBERK HE CRIED PRAISE BE TO GOD FOR NOW AM I HEALED
WHAT HE TOOK FROM THE RICH HE BESTOWED ON SUCH KNIGHTS AS WERE POOR AND LUCKLESS THESE LOVED HIM GREATLY SINCE HE GAINED LARGELY AND SPENT FREELY GRANTING OF HIS WEALTH TO ALL WHEREVER THIS KNIGHT SOJOURNED IN THE REALM HE BORE AWAY THE PRIZE
HE INQUIRED DILIGENTLY OF THE YOUNG CHAMPION AND ALL MEN WERE READY TO TELL FROM WHENCE HE CAME AND OF HIS HARNESS AND OF THE BLAZON ON HIS SHIELD AT LENGTH THE KNIGHT APPEARED IN THE LISTS AND MILON LOOKED UPON THE ADVERSARY HE SO GREATLY DESIRED TO SEE
WERE CARRIED TO THE HOUSE OF THAT DAME WHOM SO GREATLY THEY HAD LOVED WHEN THE LADY KNEW THIS DISTRESSFUL ADVENTURE STRAIGHTWAY SHE FELL TO THE GROUND BEING RETURNED FROM HER SWOON SHE MADE HER COMPLAINT CALLING UPON HER LOVERS EACH BY HIS NAME ALAS SAID SHE
FROM THE NET WHEREIN THEY WERE TAKEN BUT I FIND MY LIFE MORE BITTER THAN MY COMRADES FOUND THE GRAVE I SEE YOU ON YOUR GOINGS AND COMINGS ABOUT THE HOUSE I MAY SPEAK WITH YOU BOTH MATINS AND VESPERS
HE DETERMINED THEREFORE THAT HE WOULD LEAVE HIS COUNTRY AND SEEK ADVENTURE AS A KNIGHT ERRANT BEYOND THE SEA THE VARLET DELAYED NO LONGER THAN THE EVENING ON THE MORROW HE BADE FAREWELL TO HIS AUNT
