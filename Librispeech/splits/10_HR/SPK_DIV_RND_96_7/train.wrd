AND THE NEXT MOMENT SHE HAD CRASHED THROUGH THE ROOF UP TO HER ARMPITS AND THERE SHE HUNG QUITE UNABLE TO EXTRICATE HERSELF DIANA DASHED INTO THE DUCK HOUSE AND SEIZING HER UNFORTUNATE FRIEND BY THE WAIST
AFTER ALL IT WAS NOT TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE THINGS JUST AS GOOD AND FAR BETTER ARE COMING TRUE FOR ME ALL THE TIME AND I SUPPOSE THE EVENTS OF TODAY HAVE A FUNNY SIDE TOO PERHAPS WHEN DIANA AND I ARE OLD AND GRAY WE SHALL BE ABLE TO LAUGH OVER THEM
AND SEE A GIRL'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS STICKING OUT OF THE ROOF OF ONE OF THEIR OUTHOUSES LISTEN IS THAT A WAGON
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT FOR GIRLS I S'POSE BUT I WANT SOMETHING EXCITING LOTS OF KILLING AND SHOOTING IN IT
AND OH ANNE DEAR
HELD A SHEAF OF BLUEBELLS THE DARK CORNERS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE GRATE WERE LIGHTED UP WITH JARS FULL OF GLOWING CRIMSON PEONIES AND THE GRATE ITSELF WAS AFLAME WITH YELLOW POPPIES
THAT IS THE PANTRY WINDOW I FEEL SURE SHE SAID
BUT ANNE AND DIANA BETWEEN THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT AND THE REACTION FROM THEIR EXCITEMENT OF THE FORENOON COULD NEITHER TALK NOR EAT ANNE TRIED HEROICALLY TO BEAR HER PART IN THE CONVERSATION FOR THE SAKE OF HER GUESTS BUT ALL THE SPARKLE HAD BEEN QUENCHED IN HER FOR THE TIME BEING
SHE HAD IN ACCORDANCE WITH HER PROMISE TO MISSUS LYNDE WRITTEN TO MISS BARRY OF CHARLOTTETOWN ASKING FOR THE LOAN OF IT MISS BARRY WAS AN OLD FRIEND OF ANNE'S AND SHE PROMPTLY SENT THE PLATTER OUT WITH A LETTER EXHORTING ANNE TO BE VERY CAREFUL OF IT
BUT PRACTICAL DAVY WHO AS ANNE OFTEN DESPAIRINGLY REMARKED HADN'T A PARTICLE OF IMAGINATION WAS ONLY PUZZLED AND DISGUSTED
I REALLY FEEL SORRY FOR MISTER HARRISON
AND EVEN EXTORTED A TRIBUTE OF ADMIRATION FROM MARILLA WHO CAME IN TO CRITICIZE AND REMAINED TO PRAISE NOW WE MUST SET THE TABLE SAID ANNE IN THE TONE OF A PRIESTESS ABOUT TO PERFORM SOME SACRED RITE IN HONOR OF A DIVINITY
FOR MARTHA COPP HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO KEEP ANYTHING SHE COULD SELL BUT IF THEY WON'T THERE'S A PLATTER AT WESLEY KEYSON'S AT SPENCERVALE AND SHE KNOWS THEY'D SELL IT BUT SHE ISN'T SURE IT'S JUST THE SAME KIND AS AUNT JOSEPHINE'S
OF COURSE THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WAS THAT HE MUST BE GOOD BUT HE TRIED TO BE GOOD AND I HADN'T THE HEART TO DISAPPOINT HIM YOU'LL DROWN YOURSELF OR THE TWINS ROWING ABOUT THE POND IN THAT FLAT GRUMBLED MARILLA
FINALLY THE MORNING DAWNED PEARLY AND LUSTROUS IN A SKY FULL OF SILVER SHEEN AND RADIANCE AND THE WONDERFUL DAY HAD ARRIVED DIANA APPEARED SOON AFTER BREAKFAST WITH A BASKET OF FLOWERS OVER ONE ARM AND HER MUSLIN DRESS OVER THE OTHER
DID YOU GET VERY WET SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY OH NO RETURNED ANNE CHEERFULLY MY HEAD AND SHOULDERS ARE QUITE DRY AND MY SKIRT IS ONLY A LITTLE DAMP WHERE THE RAIN BEAT THROUGH THE LATHES
FOR EDITORS INSIST ON PLOTS SO PRISCILLA SAYS OH THERE'S MISS SARAH COPP NOW PLEASE DIANA GO AND EXPLAIN MISS SARAH COPP WAS A SMALL PERSON
THE NEXT AFTERNOON THE GIRLS FARED FORTH ON THEIR PLATTER HUNTING EXPEDITION IT WAS TEN MILES TO SPENCERVALE AND THE DAY WAS NOT ESPECIALLY PLEASANT FOR TRAVELING IT WAS VERY WARM AND WINDLESS
WHERE THE CHICKENS WERE ALREADY SIZZLING SPLENDIDLY ANNE PREPARED THE POTATOES AND DIANA GOT THE PEAS AND BEANS READY THEN WHILE DIANA SHUT HERSELF INTO THE PANTRY TO COMPOUND THE LETTUCE SALAD ANNE WHOSE CHEEKS WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO GLOW CRIMSON
ANNE SHOOK HER HEAD OH NO IT WOULDN'T BE SUITABLE AT ALL THERE IS NO PLOT IN IT YOU SEE IT'S JUST A STRING OF FANCIES I LIKE WRITING SUCH THINGS BUT OF COURSE NOTHING OF THE SORT WOULD EVER DO FOR PUBLICATION
BUT SINCE I'VE HAD YOU AND THE TWINS TO BRING UP I DON'T FEEL SO SURE OF IT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MISS BARRY'S PLATTER PAY HER BACK THE TWENTY DOLLARS SHE PAID FOR IT I SUPPOSE I'M SO THANKFUL IT WASN'T A CHERISHED HEIRLOOM BECAUSE THEN NO MONEY COULD REPLACE IT
AND IN SPITE OF HER LOVE FOR THE ALLANS AND MISS STACY SHE COULDN'T HELP THINKING HOW NICE IT WOULD BE WHEN EVERYBODY HAD GONE HOME AND SHE COULD BURY HER WEARINESS AND DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE PILLOWS OF THE EAST GABLE THERE IS AN OLD PROVERB THAT REALLY SEEMS AT TIMES TO BE INSPIRED
THANKS EITHER TO THE LEMON JUICE OR TO THE UNUSUAL FLUSH ON HER CHEEKS WHEN THEY WERE READY THEY LOOKED QUITE AS SWEET AND TRIM AND GIRLISH AS EVER DID ANY OF MISSUS MORGAN'S HEROINES I DO HOPE I'LL BE ABLE TO SAY SOMETHING ONCE IN A WHILE
DON'T PITY ME DIANA FOR I HAVEN'T MINDED IT AT ALL I KEPT THINKING HOW MUCH GOOD THE RAIN WILL DO AND HOW GLAD MY GARDEN MUST BE FOR IT AND IMAGINING WHAT THE FLOWERS AND BUDS WOULD THINK WHEN THE DROPS BEGAN TO FALL
IF BOTH WERE EQUALLY OLD AND GENUINE MARILLA LOOK AT THAT BIG STAR OVER MISTER HARRISON'S MAPLE GROVE WITH ALL THAT HOLY HUSH OF SILVERY SKY ABOUT IT IT GIVES ME A FEELING THAT IS LIKE A PRAYER AFTER ALL WHEN ONE CAN SEE STARS AND SKIES LIKE THAT
WHEN ANNE AND DIANA FINISHED WITH THE ROOM YOU WOULD NOT HAVE RECOGNIZED IT A GREAT BLUE BOWLFUL OF SNOWBALLS OVERFLOWED ON THE POLISHED TABLE THE SHINING BLACK MANTELPIECE WAS HEAPED WITH ROSES AND FERNS EVERY SHELF OF THE WHAT NOT
SAID MARILLA WHO HAD LISTENED TO THIS DIALOGUE WITH A RATHER GUILTY EXPRESSION I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D REMEMBER ABOUT THE SUGAR ANNE FOR I'M PERFECTLY CERTAIN YOU NEVER DID BEFORE SO I PUT IN A SPOONFUL
I'LL GO RIGHT OVER TO SPENCERVALE AFTER IT TOMORROW SAID ANNE RESOLUTELY AND YOU MUST COME WITH ME IT WILL BE SUCH A WEIGHT OFF MY MIND FOR I HAVE TO GO TO TOWN DAY AFTER TOMORROW AND HOW CAN I FACE YOUR AUNT JOSEPHINE WITHOUT A WILLOW WARE PLATTER
FOR HAD SHE NOT IN KEEN REMEMBRANCE OF MANY SIMILAR SNUBS ADMINISTERED IN HER OWN EARLY YEARS SOLEMNLY VOWED THAT SHE WOULD NEVER TELL ANY CHILD IT WAS TOO LITTLE TO UNDERSTAND YET HERE SHE WAS DOING IT
WHERE HE ALREADY KEPT A SCORE OR SO OF SIMILAR BALLS WHICH SO FAR AS COULD BE DISCOVERED
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE ANY HARM NO I DON'T THINK SO DECIDED ANNE AFTER DUE REFLECTION SINCE OUR MOTIVE IS NOT IDLE CURIOSITY THIS IMPORTANT POINT OF ETHICS BEING SETTLED ANNE PREPARED TO MOUNT THE AFORESAID LITTLE HOUSE
BELIEVE YOU'RE JUST TALKING NONSENSE
I ENTERED A BARN WHICH HAD APPEARED TO ME TO BE EMPTY A WOMAN WAS SLEEPING ON SOME STRAW SHE WAS YOUNG NOT INDEED SO BEAUTIFUL AS HER WHOSE PORTRAIT I HELD
WHAT I ASK OF YOU IS REASONABLE AND MODERATE I DEMAND A CREATURE OF ANOTHER SEX BUT AS HIDEOUS AS MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION IS SMALL
HE CONTINUED YOU MUST CREATE A FEMALE FOR ME WITH WHOM I CAN LIVE IN THE INTERCHANGE OF THOSE SYMPATHIES NECESSARY FOR MY BEING THIS YOU ALONE CAN DO AND I DEMAND IT OF YOU AS A RIGHT
SHALL I RESPECT MAN WHEN HE CONDEMNS ME LET HIM LIVE WITH ME IN THE INTERCHANGE OF KINDNESS AND INSTEAD OF INJURY I WOULD BESTOW EVERY BENEFIT UPON HIM WITH TEARS OF GRATITUDE AT HIS ACCEPTANCE
BUT THAT WHEN YOU ARE READY I SHALL APPEAR SAYING THIS HE SUDDENLY QUITTED ME FEARFUL PERHAPS OF ANY CHANGE IN MY SENTIMENTS I SAW HIM DESCEND THE MOUNTAIN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN THE FLIGHT OF AN EAGLE
SHALL I CREATE ANOTHER LIKE YOURSELF WHOSE JOINT WICKEDNESS MIGHT DESOLATE THE WORLD BEGONE I HAVE ANSWERED YOU YOU MAY TORTURE ME BUT I WILL NEVER CONSENT YOU ARE IN THE WRONG REPLIED THE FIEND
AND QUICKLY LOST AMONG THE UNDULATIONS OF THE SEA OF ICE
WHY DID I LIVE WHY IN THAT INSTANT DID I NOT EXTINGUISH THE SPARK OF EXISTENCE WHICH YOU HAD SO WANTONLY BESTOWED I KNOW NOT
BUT OF AN AGREEABLE ASPECT AND BLOOMING IN THE LOVELINESS OF YOUTH AND HEALTH HERE I THOUGHT IS ONE OF THOSE WHOSE JOY IMPARTING SMILES ARE BESTOWED ON ALL BUT ME AND THEN I BENT OVER HER AND WHISPERED
I DO NOT WISH TO TAKE ANY UNFAIR ADVANTAGE AND I BEG THEREFORE THAT YOU WILL TAKE SOME DAYS TO CONSIDER OF YOUR DETERMINATION IT IS UTTERLY USELESS REPLIED FELIX WE CAN NEVER AGAIN INHABIT YOUR COTTAGE THE LIFE OF MY FATHER IS IN THE GREATEST DANGER
I SANK TO THE GROUND AND MY INJURER WITH INCREASED SWIFTNESS ESCAPED INTO THE WOOD THIS
AND I SHALL BECOME A THING OF WHOSE EXISTENCE EVERYONE WILL BE IGNORANT MY VICES ARE THE CHILDREN OF A FORCED SOLITUDE THAT I ABHOR AND MY VIRTUES WILL
I GENERALLY RESTED DURING THE DAY AND TRAVELLED ONLY WHEN I WAS SECURED BY NIGHT FROM THE VIEW OF MAN ONE MORNING HOWEVER FINDING THAT MY PATH LAY THROUGH A DEEP WOOD I VENTURED TO CONTINUE MY JOURNEY AFTER THE SUN HAD RISEN
IMMENSE RECESSES CONSUMED BY A BURNING PASSION WHICH YOU ALONE CAN GRATIFY WE MAY NOT PART UNTIL YOU HAVE PROMISED TO COMPLY WITH MY REQUISITION I AM ALONE AND MISERABLE
I DO NOT INTEND TO HURT YOU LISTEN TO ME
MAN WILL NOT ASSOCIATE WITH ME BUT ONE AS DEFORMED AND HORRIBLE AS MYSELF WOULD NOT DENY HERSELF TO ME MY COMPANION MUST BE OF THE SAME SPECIES AND HAVE THE SAME DEFECTS
I CONTINUED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY IN MY HOVEL IN A STATE OF UTTER AND STUPID DESPAIR MY PROTECTORS HAD DEPARTED AND HAD BROKEN THE ONLY LINK THAT HELD ME TO THE WORLD
IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF PLACES MY EVIL PASSIONS WILL HAVE FLED FOR I SHALL MEET WITH SYMPATHY MY LIFE WILL FLOW QUIETLY AWAY AND IN MY DYING MOMENTS I SHALL NOT CURSE MY MAKER
AND SENT ME FORTH TO THIS INSUPPORTABLE MISERY THE SUN ROSE I HEARD THE VOICES OF MEN AND KNEW THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RETURN TO MY RETREAT DURING THAT DAY
AND BY THE BLUE SKY OF HEAVEN AND BY THE FIRE OF LOVE THAT BURNS MY HEART THAT IF YOU GRANT MY PRAYER WHILE THEY EXIST YOU SHALL NEVER BEHOLD ME AGAIN DEPART TO YOUR HOME AND COMMENCE YOUR LABOURS
AND WHY DO YOU AGAIN HARDEN YOURSELF TO MY COMPLAINTS I SWEAR TO YOU BY THE EARTH WHICH I INHABIT AND BY YOU THAT MADE ME THAT WITH THE COMPANION YOU BESTOW I WILL QUIT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AND DWELL AS IT MAY CHANCE
BUT I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU HOW THE ETERNAL TWINKLING OF THE STARS WEIGHED UPON ME AND HOW I LISTENED TO EVERY BLAST OF WIND AS IF IT WERE A DULL UGLY SIROC ON ITS WAY TO CONSUME ME MORNING DAWNED BEFORE I ARRIVED AT THE VILLAGE OF
TO HAVE DISCOVERED MYSELF TO THE REST OF HIS FAMILY WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR MY APPROACH
IT WAS A PORTRAIT OF A MOST LOVELY WOMAN IN SPITE OF MY MALIGNITY IT SOFTENED AND ATTRACTED ME FOR A FEW MOMENTS I GAZED WITH DELIGHT ON HER DARK EYES
I SHUDDERED WHEN I THOUGHT OF THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF MY CONSENT BUT I FELT THAT THERE WAS SOME JUSTICE IN HIS ARGUMENT HIS TALE AND THE FEELINGS HE NOW EXPRESSED PROVED HIM TO BE A CREATURE OF FINE SENSATIONS
NO INCIDENT OCCURRED FROM WHICH MY RAGE AND MISERY COULD NOT EXTRACT ITS FOOD BUT A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAPPENED WHEN I ARRIVED ON THE CONFINES OF SWITZERLAND
AND WHEN I CONSIDERED WHAT HAD PASSED AT THE COTTAGE I COULD NOT HELP BELIEVING THAT I HAD BEEN TOO HASTY IN MY CONCLUSIONS I HAD CERTAINLY ACTED IMPRUDENTLY
UNFEELING HEARTLESS CREATOR YOU HAD ENDOWED ME WITH PERCEPTIONS AND PASSIONS AND THEN CAST ME ABROAD AN OBJECT FOR THE SCORN AND HORROR OF MANKIND BUT ON YOU ONLY
WHICH DIFFERED FROM THAT OF MY PROTECTORS SOON AFTER HOWEVER FELIX APPROACHED WITH ANOTHER MAN I WAS SURPRISED AS I KNEW THAT HE HAD NOT QUITTED THE COTTAGE THAT MORNING
OR HAD HE SOME CAUSE FOR IT ALL I SUPPOSE I SHALL NEVER KNOW FOR I DARE NOT OPEN THE SUBJECT TO HIM AND YET THAT MAN WE SAW YESTERDAY HE SEEMED QUITE CERTAIN OF HIM POOR FELLOW
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CRIED HE THREW HIMSELF WITH A DESPAIRING GESTURE INTO A CHAIR AND PLACED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS AS HE SPOKE
THAT IS TRUE INDIRECTLY BUT NOT DIRECTLY HOW DO YOU MEAN PROFESSOR I ASKED I WAS A LITTLE INCLINED TO TAKE HIS SERIOUSNESS LIGHTLY FOR AFTER ALL
CLEARS THE AIR AS OTHER RAIN DOES PERHAPS IT WAS READING THE JOURNAL YESTERDAY THAT UPSET ME AND THEN JONATHAN WENT AWAY THIS MORNING TO STAY AWAY FROM ME A WHOLE DAY AND NIGHT THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE BEEN PARTED SINCE OUR MARRIAGE
HE TOOK MY HANDS AND RAISED ME UP AND MADE ME SIT ON THE SOFA AND SAT BY ME HE HELD MY HAND IN HIS AND SAID TO ME WITH OH SUCH INFINITE SWEETNESS
THAT MAY BE MORE GREAT THAN YOU CAN KNOW MAY IT BE THAT I SEE YOU YOU CAN TRUST ME I AM FRIEND OF DOCTOR JOHN SEWARD AND OF LORD GODALMING THAT WAS ARTHUR OF MISS LUCY I MUST KEEP IT PRIVATE FOR THE PRESENT FROM ALL
BUT I SHALL GET THE BUNDLE OF PAPERS YOU CAN TAKE THEM WITH YOU AND READ THEM IN THE TRAIN AFTER BREAKFAST I SAW HIM TO THE STATION WHEN WE WERE PARTING HE SAID
I SHALL WRITE SO SOON AS EVER I CAN DOCTOR SEWARD'S DIARY TWENTY SIX SEPTEMBER TRULY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FINALITY
I HAVE TRIED TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND AND IT IS NOT THE ORDINARY THINGS OF LIFE THAT COULD CLOSE IT BUT THE STRANGE THINGS THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS THE THINGS THAT MAKE ONE DOUBT IF THEY BE MAD OR SANE
HE THOUGHT HE SAW SOME ONE WHO RECALLED SOMETHING TERRIBLE SOMETHING WHICH LED TO HIS BRAIN FEVER AND HERE THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO OVERWHELM ME IN A RUSH THE PITY FOR JONATHAN THE HORROR WHICH HE EXPERIENCED THE WHOLE FEARFUL MYSTERY OF HIS DIARY
WE KEEP HIM AND WE VALUE HIM BUT ALL THE SAME WE MUST NOT LET HIM THINK HIMSELF ALL THE TRUTH IN THE UNIVERSE THEN YOU WANT ME NOT TO LET SOME PREVIOUS CONVICTION
AND LOCK MYSELF UP IN MY ROOM AND READ IT TWENTY FOUR SEPTEMBER I HADN'T THE HEART TO WRITE LAST NIGHT THAT TERRIBLE RECORD OF JONATHAN'S UPSET ME SO
WE SHALL BOTH COME WHEN YOU WILL I SAID I HAD GOT HIM THE MORNING PAPERS AND THE LONDON PAPERS OF THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND WHILE WE WERE TALKING AT THE CARRIAGE WINDOW WAITING FOR THE TRAIN TO START HE WAS TURNING THEM OVER HIS EYES SUDDENLY SEEMED TO CATCH SOMETHING IN ONE OF THEM THE WESTMINSTER GAZETTE
HE MEANT THAT WE SHALL HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND NOT LET A LITTLE BIT OF TRUTH CHECK THE RUSH OF A BIG TRUTH LIKE A SMALL ROCK DOES A RAILWAY TRUCK WE GET THE SMALL TRUTH FIRST GOOD
AND KEEPING PACE IN ALL WAYS WITH THE DUTIES THAT COME UPON HIM HE WILL BE AWAY ALL DAY TILL LATE FOR HE SAID HE COULD NOT LUNCH AT HOME MY HOUSEHOLD WORK IS DONE SO I SHALL TAKE HIS FOREIGN JOURNAL
BE REALLY IN LONDON I FEAR TO THINK
THAT AWFUL JOURNAL GETS HOLD OF MY IMAGINATION AND TINGES EVERYTHING WITH SOMETHING OF ITS OWN COLOUR OF COURSE IT IS ABOUT LUCY THAT HABIT CAME BACK TO THE POOR DEAR AND THAT AWFUL NIGHT ON THE CLIFF MUST HAVE MADE HER ILL
THE HEAD IS NOBLE WELL SIZED BROAD AND LARGE BEHIND THE EARS THE FACE CLEAN SHAVEN SHOWS A HARD SQUARE CHIN A LARGE RESOLUTE MOBILE MOUTH A GOOD SIZED NOSE RATHER STRAIGHT BUT WITH QUICK SENSITIVE NOSTRILS
I FEEL LIKE A NOVICE LUMBERING THROUGH A BOG IN A MIST JUMPING FROM ONE TUSSOCK TO ANOTHER IN THE MERE BLIND EFFORT TO MOVE ON WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE I AM GOING
CAN YOU TELL ME WHY WHEN OTHER SPIDERS DIE SMALL AND SOON THAT ONE GREAT SPIDER LIVED FOR CENTURIES IN THE TOWER OF THE OLD SPANISH CHURCH AND GREW AND GREW
I CAN SHOW IT TO YOU IF YOU LIKE OH MADAM MINA I WILL BE GRATEFUL YOU WILL DO ME MUCH FAVOUR
I HOPE TOO DOCTOR VAN HELSING WILL NOT BLAME ME I HAVE HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE AND ANXIETY OF LATE THAT I FEEL I CANNOT BEAR MORE JUST AT PRESENT I SUPPOSE A CRY DOES US ALL GOOD AT TIMES
SO I HANDED HIM THE SHORTHAND DIARY HE TOOK IT WITH A GRATEFUL BOW AND SAID MAY I READ IT IF YOU WISH I ANSWERED AS DEMURELY AS I COULD HE OPENED IT AND FOR AN INSTANT HIS FACE FELL THEN HE STOOD UP AND BOWED
AND WHAT HE LIKE NOT WHERE HE LOVE IS NOT TO HIS GOOD THEREFORE FOR HIS SAKE YOU MUST EAT AND SMILE
A MAN OF MEDIUM WEIGHT STRONGLY BUILT WITH HIS SHOULDERS SET BACK OVER A BROAD DEEP CHEST AND A NECK WELL BALANCED ON THE TRUNK
I CANNOT HELP FEELING TERRIBLY EXCITED AS THE TIME DRAWS NEAR FOR THE VISIT OF DOCTOR VAN HELSING FOR SOMEHOW I EXPECT THAT IT WILL THROW SOME LIGHT UPON JONATHAN'S SAD EXPERIENCE AND AS HE ATTENDED POOR DEAR LUCY IN HER LAST ILLNESS HE CAN TELL ME ALL ABOUT HER
AND NOW HE SAID MAY I ASK YOU FOR SOME MORE HELP I HAVE A GREAT TASK TO DO AND AT THE BEGINNING IT IS TO KNOW YOU CAN HELP ME HERE CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT WENT BEFORE YOUR GOING TO TRANSYLVANIA
YOU ARE SO GOOD HE SAID AND MAY I READ IT NOW I MAY WANT TO ASK YOU SOME THINGS WHEN I HAVE READ BY ALL MEANS I SAID READ IT OVER WHILST I ORDER LUNCH AND THEN YOU CAN ASK ME QUESTIONS WHILST WE EAT
NOR IN HYPNOTISM YES I SAID CHARCOT HAS PROVED THAT PRETTY WELL HE SMILED AS HE WENT ON THEN YOU ARE SATISFIED AS TO IT YES
MISTER LEE IS FAR FROM INFALLIBLE IN HIS REMEDIES FOR FACTORY AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BUT IN SENSITIVENESS TO THE FLOWING STREET OF HUMANITY HE IS INDEED A MAN
LISTEN TO THE NAMES OF SOME OF THE DIVISIONS OF HIS BOOK CROWDS AND MACHINES LETTING THE CROWDS BE GOOD LETTING THE CROWDS BE BEAUTIFUL CROWDS AND HEROES
I HAVE BEEN ASSURED BY A VERY KNOWING AMERICAN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE IN LONDON THAT A YOUNG HEALTHY CHILD WELL NURSED IS AT A YEAR OLD A MOST DELICIOUS
YET THE SEA OF HUMANITY IS DRAMATICALLY BLOOD BROTHER TO THE PACIFIC ATLANTIC OR MEDITERRANEAN
IT WOULD GREATLY LESSEN THE NUMBER OF PAPISTS WITH WHOM WE ARE YEARLY OVER RUN BEING THE PRINCIPAL BREEDERS OF THE NATION AS WELL AS OUR MOST DANGEROUS ENEMIES AND WHO
BUT IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY MY FRIEND HE CONFESSED THAT THIS EXPEDIENT WAS PUT INTO HIS HEAD BY THE FAMOUS SALMANAAZOR A NATIVE OF THE ISLAND FORMOSA
I RECOMMEND THEIR WORKS TO HIM AS A BETTER BASIS FOR FUTURE SOUTHERN SCENARIOS THE BIRTH OF A NATION HAS BEEN VERY PROPERLY DENOUNCED FOR ITS SIMON LEGREE QUALITIES BY FRANCIS HACKETT JANE ADDAMS AND OTHERS
A TRUE LOVER OF HIS COUNTRY AND WHOSE VIRTUES I HIGHLY ESTEEM WAS LATELY PLEASED IN DISCOURSING ON THIS MATTER TO OFFER A REFINEMENT UPON MY SCHEME HE SAID THAT MANY GENTLEMEN OF THIS KINGDOM
NOR OFFER TO BEAT OR KICK THEM AS IS TOO FREQUENT A PRACTICE FOR FEAR OF A MISCARRIAGE MANY OTHER ADVANTAGES MIGHT BE ENUMERATED FOR INSTANCE
THE ONSET IS UNEXPECTEDLY NEAR TO THE HOUSE WHERE ONCE WAS THE DANCE THE BOY IS AT FIRST A COWARD HE ENTERS THE OLD FAMILIAR DOOR HE APPEALS TO THE GIRL TO HIDE HIM
NOT EXCEEDING FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOR UNDER TWELVE SO GREAT A NUMBER OF BOTH SEXES IN EVERY COUNTRY BEING NOW READY TO STARVE FOR WANT OF WORK AND SERVICE AND THESE TO BE DISPOSED OF BY THEIR PARENTS IF ALIVE
BESIDES THE PROFIT OF A NEW DISH INTRODUCED TO THE TABLES OF ALL GENTLEMEN OF FORTUNE IN THE KINGDOM WHO HAVE ANY REFINEMENT IN TASTE AND THE MONEY WILL CIRCULATE AMONG OUR SELVES THE GOODS BEING ENTIRELY OF OUR OWN GROWTH AND MANUFACTURE
CHAPTER FIVE THE PICTURE OF CROWD SPLENDOR
THIS I FREELY OWN AND TWAS INDEED ONE PRINCIPAL DESIGN IN OFFERING IT TO THE WORLD I DESIRE THE READER WILL OBSERVE THAT I CALCULATE MY REMEDY FOR THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL KINGDOM OF IRELAND
WHO CAME FROM THENCE TO LONDON ABOVE TWENTY YEARS AGO AND IN CONVERSATION TOLD MY FRIEND THAT IN HIS COUNTRY WHEN ANY YOUNG PERSON HAPPENED TO BE PUT TO DEATH THE EXECUTIONER SOLD THE CARCASS TO PERSONS OF QUALITY AS A PRIME DAINTY
VANITY IDLENESS AND GAMING IN OUR WOMEN OF INTRODUCING A VEIN OF PARSIMONY PRUDENCE AND TEMPERANCE OF LEARNING TO LOVE OUR COUNTRY WHEREIN WE DIFFER EVEN FROM LAPLANDERS AND THE INHABITANTS OF
AND I HAVE BEEN DESIRED TO EMPLOY MY THOUGHTS WHAT COURSE MAY BE TAKEN TO EASE THE NATION OF SO GRIEVOUS AN INCUMBRANCE BUT I AM NOT IN THE LEAST PAIN UPON THAT MATTER
THIS FOOD WOULD LIKEWISE BRING GREAT CUSTOM TO TAVERNS WHERE THE VINTNERS WILL CERTAINLY BE SO PRUDENT AS TO PROCURE THE BEST RECEIPTS FOR DRESSING IT TO PERFECTION AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE THEIR HOUSES FREQUENTED BY ALL THE FINE GENTLEMEN
AND GROW POPULAR AMONG HIS TENANTS THE MOTHER WILL HAVE EIGHT SHILLINGS NEAT PROFIT AND BE FIT FOR WORK TILL SHE PRODUCES ANOTHER CHILD THOSE WHO ARE MORE THRIFTY AS I MUST CONFESS THE TIMES REQUIRE
ALTHOUGH PERHAPS I COULD NAME A COUNTRY WHICH WOULD BE GLAD TO EAT UP OUR WHOLE NATION WITHOUT IT AFTER ALL I AM NOT SO VIOLENTLY BENT UPON MY OWN OPINION AS TO REJECT ANY OFFER PROPOSED BY WISE MEN
WHO PROTESTED TO ME THAT HE NEVER KNEW ABOVE ONE OR TWO INSTANCES UNDER THE AGE OF SIX EVEN IN A PART OF THE KINGDOM SO RENOWNED FOR THE QUICKEST PROFICIENCY IN THAT ART
IN THE GLASS LATER
WILL BE PLEASED MATURELY TO CONSIDER TWO POINTS FIRST AS THINGS NOW STAND HOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO FIND FOOD
EXCEPT WHERE THEY ARE OF TOWARDLY PARTS ALTHOUGH I CONFESS THEY LEARN THE RUDIMENTS MUCH EARLIER DURING WHICH TIME THEY CAN HOWEVER BE PROPERLY LOOKED UPON ONLY AS PROBATIONERS
THE QUESTION THEREFORE IS HOW THIS NUMBER SHALL BE REARED AND PROVIDED FOR WHICH AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID UNDER THE PRESENT SITUATION OF AFFAIRS IS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE BY ALL THE METHODS HITHERTO PROPOSED
WHICH OF THEM COULD BRING THE FATTEST CHILD TO THE MARKET MEN WOULD BECOME AS FOND OF THEIR WIVES DURING THE TIME OF THEIR PREGNANCY AS THEY ARE NOW OF THEIR MARES IN FOAL THEIR COWS IN CALF
THROUGH FIVE OTHER REELS OF A MIXED PROGRAMME THAT USUALLY IS BAD THAT IS THE REASON ONE REEL MASTERPIECES SELDOM APPEAR NOW THE PRODUCER IN A MOOD TO MAKE A SPECIAL EFFORT
ANSWERED SEVERAL QUESTIONS IN REGARD TO THE PHOTOPLAY HERE ARE TWO BITS FROM HIS DISCOURSE STRIKE THE DIALOGUE FROM MOLIERE'S TARTUFFE AND WHAT AUDIENCE WOULD BEAR ITS MERE STAGE BUSINESS
FULL IN OUR OWN POWER AND WHEREBY WE CAN INCUR NO DANGER
MY TRADE WAS A SADDLER AND AS MY DEALINGS WERE CHIEFLY NOT BY A SHOP OR CHANCE TRADE BUT AMONG THE MERCHANTS TRADING TO THE ENGLISH COLONIES IN AMERICA SO MY EFFECTS LAY VERY MUCH IN THE HANDS OF SUCH
AND THAT WE HOPED WAS NOT TRUE TILL THE LATTER END OF NOVEMBER OR THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN TWO MEN SAID TO BE FRENCHMEN DIED OF THE PLAGUE IN LONG ACRE
BUT STILL AS THERE WAS BUT ONE OF THE PLAGUE PEOPLE BEGAN TO BE EASY THE WHOLE BILL ALSO WAS VERY LOW FOR THE WEEK BEFORE THE BILL WAS BUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN
SAINT BRIDE'S ZERO SAINT JAMES'S EIGHT
I READ ON TO THE SEVENTH VERSE EXCLUSIVE AND AFTER THAT INCLUDED THE TENTH AS FOLLOWS I WILL SAY OF THE LORD HE IS MY REFUGE AND MY FORTRESS MY GOD
I OBEYED THIS LAY CLOSE TO ME AND MY MIND SEEMED MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED TO STAY THAN EVER AND SUPPORTED WITH A SECRET SATISFACTION THAT I SHOULD BE KEPT ADD TO THIS THAT
AMONG THE WEALTHIEST OF THE PEOPLE AND SUCH PEOPLE AS WERE UNENCUMBERED WITH TRADES AND BUSINESS BUT OF THE REST THE GENERALITY STAYED AND SEEMED TO ABIDE THE WORST SO THAT
I TOLD HIM THAT I INCLINED TO STAY AND TAKE MY LOT IN THAT STATION IN WHICH GOD HAD PLACED ME AND THAT IT SEEMED TO BE MADE MORE ESPECIALLY MY DUTY ON THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT I HAVE SAID
IT BEGAN TO BE SUSPECTED THAT THE PLAGUE WAS AMONG THE PEOPLE AT THAT END OF THE TOWN AND THAT MANY HAD DIED OF IT THOUGH THEY HAD TAKEN CARE TO KEEP IT AS MUCH FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE
AS ANYONE MIGHT PERCEIVE BY THEIR APPEARANCE THIS WAS A VERY TERRIBLE AND MELANCHOLY THING TO SEE AND AS IT WAS A SIGHT WHICH I COULD NOT BUT LOOK ON FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
BUT AFTER THAT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY ANOTHER DIED IN ANOTHER HOUSE BUT IN THE SAME PARISH AND IN THE SAME MANNER THIS TURNED THE PEOPLE'S EYES PRETTY MUCH TOWARDS THAT END OF THE TOWN
SPREAD RUMOURS AND REPORTS OF THINGS AND TO IMPROVE THEM BY THE INVENTION OF MEN AS I HAVE LIVED TO SEE PRACTISED SINCE
SO I WAS PUT OFF FOR THAT TIME AND ONE WAY OR OTHER I ALWAYS FOUND THAT TO APPOINT TO GO AWAY WAS ALWAYS CROSSED BY SOME ACCIDENT OR OTHER SO AS TO DISAPPOINT AND PUT IT OFF AGAIN
IN THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WENT TO OXFORD WHERE IT PLEASED GOD TO PRESERVE THEM AND THE DISTEMPER DID NOT AS I HEARD OF SO MUCH AS TOUCH THEM FOR WHICH I CANNOT SAY THAT
AT THE SAME TIME IN LONDON AND NOT MANY YEARS BEFORE COME OVER FROM PORTUGAL AND ADVISING WITH HIM HIS ANSWER WAS IN THREE WORDS
THEY WOULD GO UNCONCERNED INTO INFECTED PLACES AND CONVERSE WITH INFECTED PERSONS BY WHICH MEANS THEY DIED AT THE RATE OF TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND A WEEK
ABOUT THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS BEING FROM HEAVEN I MENTION THIS STORY ALSO AS THE BEST METHOD I CAN ADVISE ANY PERSON TO TAKE IN SUCH A CASE ESPECIALLY IF HE BE ONE THAT MAKES CONSCIENCE OF HIS DUTY
BUT WE PERCEIVED THE INFECTION KEPT CHIEFLY IN THE OUT PARISHES WHICH BEING VERY POPULOUS AND FULLER ALSO OF POOR THE DISTEMPER FOUND MORE TO PREY UPON THAN IN THE CITY
I OUGHT TO ACQUIESCE IN THE DIRECTION OF HIM WHO HAVING BEEN MY MAKER HAD AN UNDISPUTED RIGHT OF SOVEREIGNTY IN DISPOSING OF ME AND THAT THEN THERE HAD BEEN
SO THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS MUST HAVE SOMETHING IN THEM EXTRAORDINARY AND I OUGHT TO CONSIDER WHETHER IT DID NOT EVIDENTLY POINT OUT OR INTIMATE TO ME THAT IT WAS THE WILL OF HEAVEN I SHOULD NOT GO
FOR THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY WITHIN THE WALLS WAS INDIFFERENTLY HEALTHY STILL NOR WAS IT GOT THEN VERY MUCH OVER THE WATER INTO SOUTHWARK
TO NOTE WHAT BECAME OF ME I HAD TWO IMPORTANT THINGS BEFORE ME
THAT WOULD SURROUND ME AND THAT IF I ATTEMPTED TO SECURE MYSELF BY FLEEING FROM MY HABITATION AND ACTED CONTRARY TO THESE INTIMATIONS WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE DIVINE IT WAS A KIND OF
SAINT JAMES'S SIX BESIDES THIS IT WAS OBSERVED WITH GREAT UNEASINESS BY THE PEOPLE THAT THE WEEKLY BILLS IN GENERAL INCREASED VERY MUCH DURING THESE WEEKS ALTHOUGH IT WAS AT A TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN
HAD MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT TRAVELLED DONE SO THE PLAGUE HAD NOT BEEN CARRIED INTO SO MANY COUNTRY TOWNS AND HOUSES AS IT WAS TO THE GREAT DAMAGE AND INDEED TO THE RUIN OF ABUNDANCE OF PEOPLE
WHEREAS THE EUROPEANS OR CHRISTIAN MERCHANTS WHO KEPT THEMSELVES RETIRED AND RESERVED GENERALLY ESCAPED THE CONTAGION UPON THESE ARGUMENTS MY BROTHER CHANGED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN
BUT THIS WAS ALL KNAVERY AND COLLUSION
AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THOUGH THEY WERE AT FIRST IN A MOST INEXPRESSIBLE CONSTERNATION YET AS I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE DISTEMPER INTERMITTED OFTEN AT FIRST SO THEY WERE AS IT WERE
IN HIM WILL I TRUST SURELY HE SHALL DELIVER THEE FROM THE SNARE OF THE FOWLER AND FROM THE NOISOME PESTILENCE HE SHALL COVER THEE WITH HIS FEATHERS AND UNDER HIS WINGS SHALT THOU TRUST
HERE COME MY DEAR GIRLS CRIED MISSUS THORPE POINTING AT THREE SMART LOOKING FEMALES WHO ARM IN ARM WERE THEN MOVING TOWARDS HER
AND MISSUS ALLEN IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE FEATURES OF A FORMER SCHOOLFELLOW AND INTIMATE WHOM SHE HAD SEEN ONLY ONCE SINCE THEIR RESPECTIVE MARRIAGES AND THAT MANY YEARS AGO THEIR JOY ON THIS MEETING WAS VERY GREAT
SOON AFTER THEIR REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THE SET CATHERINE PERCEIVED HERSELF TO BE EARNESTLY REGARDED BY A GENTLEMAN WHO STOOD AMONG THE LOOKERS ON IMMEDIATELY BEHIND HER PARTNER
OF A COMMANDING ASPECT PAST THE BLOOM BUT NOT PAST THE VIGOUR OF LIFE AND WITH HIS EYE STILL DIRECTED TOWARDS HER SHE SAW HIM PRESENTLY ADDRESS MISTER TILNEY IN A FAMILIAR WHISPER
CONSOLING HERSELF HOWEVER WITH THE DISCOVERY WHICH HER KEEN EYE SOON MADE
THAT THOUGH CATHERINE'S SUPPORTING OPINION WAS NOT UNFREQUENTLY CALLED FOR BY ONE OR THE OTHER SHE WAS NEVER ABLE TO GIVE ANY
THE TALLEST IS ISABELLA MY ELDEST IS NOT SHE A FINE YOUNG WOMAN THE OTHERS ARE VERY MUCH ADMIRED TOO BUT I BELIEVE ISABELLA IS THE HANDSOMEST
AND THE HONEST RELISH OF BALLS AND PLAYS AND EVERYDAY SIGHTS IS PAST WITH THEM HERE THEIR CONVERSATION CLOSED THE DEMANDS OF THE DANCE BECOMING NOW TOO IMPORTUNATE FOR A DIVIDED ATTENTION
SUCH AS DRESS BALLS FLIRTATIONS AND QUIZZES MISS THORPE HOWEVER BEING FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN MISS MORLAND AND AT LEAST FOUR YEARS BETTER INFORMED
THE MORNING HAD ANSWERED ALL HER HOPES AND THE EVENING OF THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS NOW THE OBJECT OF EXPECTATION THE FUTURE GOOD WHAT GOWN AND WHAT HEAD DRESS SHE SHOULD WEAR ON THE OCCASION BECAME HER CHIEF CONCERN
NO INDEED I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT THEN I AM QUITE AT A LOSS ONE THING HOWEVER I MUST OBSERVE THIS DISPOSITION ON YOUR SIDE IS RATHER ALARMING
EDWARD AT MERCHANT TAYLORS AND WILLIAM AT SEA AND ALL OF THEM MORE BELOVED AND RESPECTED IN THEIR DIFFERENT STATION THAN ANY OTHER THREE BEINGS EVER WERE
MISTER THORPE IS SUCH A VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MY BROTHER'S THAT IF HE TALKS TO ME I MUST TALK TO HIM AGAIN BUT THERE ARE HARDLY THREE YOUNG MEN IN THE ROOM BESIDES HIM THAT I HAVE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH AND IS THAT TO BE MY ONLY SECURITY ALAS ALAS
BUT I NEED NOT ASK YOU FOR YOU LOOK DELIGHTFULLY YOU REALLY HAVE DONE YOUR HAIR IN A MORE HEAVENLY STYLE THAN EVER
NOW MISTER MORLAND FOR HE WAS CLOSE TO HER ON THE OTHER SIDE I SHALL NOT SPEAK ANOTHER WORD TO YOU ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING SO I CHARGE YOU NOT TO EXPECT IT MY SWEETEST CATHERINE HOW HAVE YOU BEEN THIS LONG AGE
UP THE STEPS AND DOWN PEOPLE WHOM NOBODY CARED ABOUT AND NOBODY WANTED TO SEE AND HE ONLY WAS ABSENT WHAT A DELIGHTFUL PLACE BATH IS SAID MISSUS ALLEN AS THEY SAT DOWN NEAR THE GREAT CLOCK
IS HE IN THE HOUSE NOW LOOK ABOUT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE I ASSURE YOU I CAN HARDLY EXIST TILL I SEE HIM NO SAID CATHERINE HE IS NOT HERE I CANNOT SEE HIM ANYWHERE OH HORRID
WHICH I CAN KNOW NOTHING OF THERE YOU ARE NOT FOND OF THE COUNTRY YES I AM I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED THERE AND ALWAYS BEEN VERY HAPPY
TWELVE O'CLOCK WAS HER PARTING SPEECH TO HER NEW FRIEND OF HER OTHER HER OLDER HER MORE ESTABLISHED FRIEND ISABELLA OF WHOSE FIDELITY AND WORTH SHE HAD ENJOYED A FORTNIGHT'S EXPERIENCE SHE SCARCELY SAW ANYTHING DURING THE EVENING
AND ALL OUR AGREEABLENESS BELONGS SOLELY TO EACH OTHER FOR THAT TIME NOBODY CAN FASTEN THEMSELVES ON THE NOTICE OF ONE WITHOUT INJURING THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER I CONSIDER A COUNTRY DANCE AS AN EMBLEM OF MARRIAGE
AND A VERY INDULGENT MOTHER HER ELDEST DAUGHTER HAD GREAT PERSONAL BEAUTY AND THE YOUNGER ONES BY PRETENDING TO BE AS HANDSOME AS THEIR SISTER IMITATING HER AIR AND DRESSING IN THE SAME STYLE DID VERY WELL
THEIR INCREASING ATTACHMENT WAS NOT TO BE SATISFIED WITH HALF A DOZEN TURNS IN THE PUMP ROOM BUT REQUIRED WHEN THEY ALL QUITTED IT TOGETHER
SPOKE OF THEM IN TERMS WHICH MADE HER ALL EAGERNESS TO KNOW THEM TOO AND ON HER OPENLY FEARING THAT SHE MIGHT FIND NOBODY TO GO WITH HER IT WAS PROPOSED BY THE BROTHER AND SISTER THAT THEY SHOULD JOIN IN A WALK SOME MORNING OR OTHER I SHALL LIKE IT SHE CRIED
ONE DAY IN THE COUNTRY IS EXACTLY LIKE ANOTHER BUT THEN YOU SPEND YOUR TIME SO MUCH MORE RATIONALLY IN THE COUNTRY DO I DO YOU NOT I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS MUCH DIFFERENCE HERE YOU ARE IN PURSUIT ONLY OF AMUSEMENT ALL DAY LONG
SHE COULD COMPARE THE BALLS OF BATH WITH THOSE OF TUNBRIDGE ITS FASHIONS WITH THE FASHIONS OF LONDON COULD RECTIFY THE OPINIONS OF HER NEW FRIEND IN MANY ARTICLES OF TASTEFUL ATTIRE COULD DISCOVER A FLIRTATION BETWEEN ANY GENTLEMAN AND LADY WHO
THIS CIVILITY WAS DULY RETURNED AND THEY PARTED ON MISS TILNEY'S SIDE WITH SOME KNOWLEDGE OF HER NEW ACQUAINTANCE'S FEELINGS AND ON CATHERINE'S WITHOUT THE SMALLEST CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING EXPLAINED THEM SHE WENT HOME VERY HAPPY
AND SO I AM AT HOME ONLY I DO NOT FIND SO MUCH OF IT I WALK ABOUT HERE AND SO I DO THERE BUT HERE I SEE A VARIETY OF PEOPLE IN EVERY STREET AND THERE I CAN ONLY GO AND CALL ON MISSUS ALLEN
THAT YOU THINK THEY CANNOT BE COMPARED TOGETHER TO BE SURE NOT PEOPLE THAT MARRY CAN NEVER PART BUT MUST GO AND KEEP HOUSE TOGETHER PEOPLE THAT DANCE ONLY STAND OPPOSITE EACH OTHER IN A LONG ROOM FOR HALF AN HOUR
NO INDEED I SHOULD NOT OH YES YOU WOULD INDEED I KNOW YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF
AND CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY TOOK HER USUAL PLACE BY THE SIDE OF HER FRIEND JAMES WHO WAS NOW IN CONSTANT ATTENDANCE MAINTAINED A SIMILAR POSITION AND SEPARATING THEMSELVES FROM THE REST OF THEIR PARTY THEY WALKED IN THAT MANNER FOR SOME TIME
MOREOVER HE HAD THIS ADVANTAGE HE WAS MASTER OF THE COUNT'S SECRET WHILE THE COUNT HAD NO HOLD ON FRANZ WHO HAD NOTHING TO CONCEAL HOWEVER HE RESOLVED TO LEAD THE CONVERSATION TO A SUBJECT WHICH MIGHT POSSIBLY CLEAR UP HIS DOUBTS
AND THERE MENTION WAS MADE OF SOMETHING LIKE A PARDON FOR ONE OF THE TWO MEN FOR ANDREA RONDOLO ASKED FRANZ NO REPLIED THE COUNT CARELESSLY FOR THE OTHER HE GLANCED AT THE TABLETS AS IF TO RECALL THE NAME FOR PEPPINO CALLED ROCCA PRIORI
HE HAD COME TO NO DETERMINATION AND AS NOTHING IN THE COUNT'S MANNER MANIFESTED THE WISH THAT HE SHOULD RECOGNIZE HIM HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO MAKE ANY ALLUSION TO THE PAST OR WAIT UNTIL HE HAD MORE PROOF
BUT HE DID NOT APPEAR TO RECOGNIZE HIM IT WAS EVIDENT HE HAD HIS ORDERS MONSIEUR BERTUCCIO SAID THE COUNT YOU HAVE PROCURED ME WINDOWS LOOKING ON THE PIAZZA DEL POPOLO AS I ORDERED YOU YESTERDAY
TO ESCAPE WITH A FEW MOMENTS OF PHYSICAL PAIN YES I KNOW SAID FRANZ THAT HUMAN JUSTICE IS INSUFFICIENT TO CONSOLE US SHE CAN GIVE BLOOD IN RETURN FOR BLOOD THAT IS ALL BUT YOU MUST DEMAND FROM HER ONLY WHAT IT IS IN HER POWER TO GRANT
AND WHICH ARE UNPUNISHED BY SOCIETY ANSWER ME DO NOT THESE CRIMES EXIST YES ANSWERED FRANZ AND IT IS TO PUNISH THEM THAT DUELLING IS TOLERATED AH DUELLING CRIED THE COUNT A
A WOUND THAT NEVER CLOSES IN YOUR BREAST DO YOU THINK THE REPARATION THAT SOCIETY GIVES YOU IS SUFFICIENT
COUNT SAID HE YOU HAVE OFFERED US PLACES IN YOUR CARRIAGE AND AT YOUR WINDOWS IN THE ROSPOLI PALACE CAN YOU TELL US WHERE WE CAN OBTAIN A SIGHT OF THE PIAZZA DEL POPOLO AH SAID THE COUNT NEGLIGENTLY LOOKING ATTENTIVELY AT MORCERF
PLEASANT MANNER UPON MY SOUL OF ARRIVING AT YOUR END WHEN THAT END IS VENGEANCE A MAN HAS CARRIED OFF YOUR MISTRESS A MAN HAS SEDUCED YOUR WIFE A MAN HAS DISHONORED YOUR DAUGHTER
AND HOW ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS TEMPERAMENTS AND EVEN THE DIFFERENT CUSTOMS OF THEIR COUNTRIES DIFFERENT PERSONS BEAR THE TRANSITION FROM LIFE TO DEATH FROM EXISTENCE TO ANNIHILATION AS FOR MYSELF I CAN ASSURE YOU OF ONE THING
AND TO WHOSE TENDER MERCY RICHELIEU HAD DOUBTLESS RECOMMENDED THE SUFFERER AH ADDED THE COUNT IN A CONTEMPTUOUS TONE
GENTLEMEN SAID THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO AS HE ENTERED I PRAY YOU EXCUSE ME FOR SUFFERING MY VISIT TO BE ANTICIPATED BUT I FEARED TO DISTURB YOU BY PRESENTING MYSELF EARLIER AT YOUR APARTMENTS
AND HE WHO POURS OUT VENGEANCE RUNS THE RISK OF TASTING A BITTER DRAUGHT YES IF HE BE POOR AND INEXPERIENCED NOT IF HE BE RICH AND SKILFUL BESIDES THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN TO HIM WOULD BE THE PUNISHMENT OF WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN
BESIDES ALTHOUGH SURE IT WAS HE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE BOX THE PREVIOUS EVENING HE COULD NOT BE EQUALLY POSITIVE
AH CONTINUED THE COUNT BE GOOD ENOUGH TO ASK PASTRINI IF HE HAS RECEIVED THE TAVOLETTA AND IF HE CAN SEND US AN ACCOUNT OF THE EXECUTION
FRANZ AND I HAVE TO THANK YOU A THOUSAND TIMES COUNT RETURNED ALBERT YOU EXTRICATED US FROM A GREAT DILEMMA AND WE WERE ON THE POINT OF INVENTING A VERY FANTASTIC VEHICLE WHEN YOUR FRIENDLY INVITATION REACHED US INDEED RETURNED THE COUNT
HE HAS RENDERED THE WHOLE LIFE OF ONE WHO HAD THE RIGHT TO EXPECT FROM HEAVEN THAT PORTION OF HAPPINESS GOD HAS PROMISED TO EVERY ONE OF HIS CREATURES AN EXISTENCE OF MISERY AND INFAMY AND YOU THINK YOU ARE AVENGED BECAUSE YOU SEND A BALL THROUGH THE HEAD
HE EXTENDED HIS HAND AND RANG THE BELL THRICE DID YOU EVER OCCUPY YOURSELF SAID HE TO FRANZ
OR PASS A SWORD THROUGH THE BREAST OF THAT MAN WHO HAS PLANTED MADNESS IN YOUR BRAIN AND DESPAIR IN YOUR HEART AND REMEMBER MOREOVER THAT IT IS OFTEN HE
OH YES REPLIED THE COUNT UNDERSTAND ME I WOULD FIGHT A DUEL FOR A TRIFLE FOR AN INSULT FOR A BLOW AND THE MORE SO THAT THANKS TO MY SKILL IN ALL BODILY EXERCISES AND THE INDIFFERENCE TO DANGER I HAVE GRADUALLY ACQUIRED
THESE GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE TWO FRIENDS WILL I TRUST DO ME THE HONOR TO BREAKFAST WITH ME BUT MY DEAR COUNT SAID ALBERT WE SHALL ABUSE YOUR KINDNESS NOT AT ALL ON THE CONTRARY YOU WILL GIVE ME GREAT PLEASURE
AND EVEN THE SECOND WHILE THE OTHER AS YOU MUST KNOW IS VERY SIMPLE THE MANDAIA NEVER FAILS NEVER TREMBLES NEVER STRIKES THIRTY TIMES INEFFECTUALLY
AND WHICH THE PHILANTHROPIC FRENCH REVOLUTION HAS SUBSTITUTED FOR BEING TORN TO PIECES BY HORSES OR BROKEN ON THE WHEEL WHAT MATTERS THIS PUNISHMENT AS LONG AS HE IS AVENGED ON MY WORD I ALMOST REGRET THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY
BUT I THINK SINCE YESTERDAY SOME CHANGE HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE ORDER OF THE CEREMONY REALLY SAID FRANZ
THIS MISERABLE PEPPINO WILL NOT BE BEHEADED AS YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY THEN OF SEEING HOW SHORT A TIME THE PUNISHMENT LASTS AND WHETHER IT IS WORTH EVEN MENTIONING
WITH THE DETESTABLE BANDIT LUIGI VAMPA AND THE MEN OF HIS BAND HUM THE FIRST WILL BE MAZZOLATO THE SECOND DECAPITATO YES CONTINUED THE COUNT IT WAS AT FIRST ARRANGED IN THIS WAY
THERE ARE AT LEAST FEW THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN SAID THE COUNT COLDLY AND YOU TOOK PLEASURE IN BEHOLDING THESE DREADFUL SPECTACLES MY FIRST SENTIMENT WAS HORROR THE SECOND INDIFFERENCE THE THIRD CURIOSITY
OR OFFERING HIM EVEN THE INSUFFICIENT MEANS OF VENGEANCE OF WHICH WE HAVE JUST SPOKEN ARE THERE NOT CRIMES FOR WHICH THE IMPALEMENT OF THE TURKS THE AUGERS OF THE PERSIANS THE STAKE AND THE BRAND OF THE IROQUOIS INDIANS ARE INADEQUATE TORTURES
BUT IT WAS VERY LATE DID I NOT TELL YOU I WISHED FOR ONE REPLIED THE COUNT FROWNING AND YOUR EXCELLENCY HAS ONE WHICH WAS LET TO PRINCE LOBANIEFF BUT I WAS OBLIGED TO PAY A HUNDRED
I SHOULD BE ALMOST CERTAIN TO KILL MY MAN OH I WOULD FIGHT FOR SUCH A CAUSE BUT IN RETURN FOR A SLOW PROFOUND ETERNAL TORTURE I WOULD GIVE BACK THE SAME WERE IT POSSIBLE AN EYE FOR AN EYE A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH AS THE ORIENTALISTS SAY
IT WAS THE FAULT OF THAT BLOCKHEAD PASTRINI THAT I DID NOT SOONER ASSIST YOU IN YOUR DISTRESS HE DID NOT MENTION A SYLLABLE OF YOUR EMBARRASSMENT TO ME WHEN HE KNOWS THAT ALONE AND ISOLATED AS I AM I SEEK EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MY NEIGHBORS
THEN THE SMITH MUST BE FETCHED TO FILE AWAY THE BARS BUT ALL THAT WOULD NOT BE DONE SO QUICKLY AS HE COULD THINK ABOUT IT THE WHOLE CHARITY SCHOOL JUST OPPOSITE WOULD BE IN MOTION ALL THE NEW BOOTHS WITH THEIR NOT VERY COURTIER LIKE SWARM OF SEAMEN
HE HAS A HOME A WIFE AND CHILDREN WHO WEEP WITH HIM OVER HIS SORROWS WHO REJOICE WITH HIM WHEN HE IS GLAD
THIS THE LIEUTENANT FELT MOST POIGNANTLY AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE LEANT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW AND SIGHED SO DEEPLY
HE HASTENED OFF TO HIS ROOM WHERE THE PAINS CONSEQUENT ON THE FRIGHT THE SHOES HAD PREPARED FOR HIM DID NOT SO SOON TAKE THEIR LEAVE BUT YOU MUST NOT THINK THAT THE AFFAIR IS OVER NOW IT GROWS MUCH WORSE THE NIGHT PASSED THE NEXT DAY ALSO
IN THAT LADY YONDER SO STRANGELY DRESSED I SHOULD FIND FOR CERTAIN A LARGE MILLINER'S SHOP IN THAT ONE THE SHOP IS EMPTY BUT IT WANTS CLEANING PLAIN ENOUGH
I CAN NOW SAID HE TO HIMSELF FANCY THE WHOLE ROW OF LADIES AND GENTLEMEN SITTING THERE IN THE FRONT ROW IF ONE COULD BUT SEE INTO THEIR HEARTS YES THAT WOULD BE A REVELATION A SORT OF BAZAR
YET WITHOUT EXPRESSING HIS OPINION OPENLY HE TELLS THE PEOPLE ENOUGH TO SET THEM ALL THINKING AND GUESSING BUT IN ORDER TO HURT NOBODY HE WRAPS HIS WITTY ORACULAR JUDGMENTS IN A TRANSPARENT VEIL OR RATHER IN A LURID THUNDERCLOUD SHOOTING FORTH BRIGHT SPARKS OF WIT
BUT WITH ALL HIS CLOTHES ON IN HIS BOOTS AND GALOSHES WHILE THE HOT DROPS FELL SCALDING FROM THE CEILING ON HIS FACE HOLLOA CRIED HE LEAPING DOWN THE BATHING ATTENDANT ON HIS SIDE UTTERED A LOUD CRY OF ASTONISHMENT WHEN HE BEHELD IN THE BATH A MAN COMPLETELY DRESSED
THE PART OF THE BODY MOST DIFFICULT TO MANAGE ON SUCH OCCASIONS WAS NO DOUBT THE HEAD
THE WOMAN EXAMINED HIM WITH EYES OF ASTONISHMENT AND SHOOK HER HEAD SHE THEN ADDRESSED HIM IN GERMAN THE COUNCILLOR THOUGHT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND DANISH AND THEREFORE REPEATED HIS WISH IN GERMAN THIS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS COSTUME STRENGTHENED THE GOOD WOMAN IN THE BELIEF THAT HE WAS A FOREIGNER
THERE FALLS ANOTHER STAR SAID HE BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER THERE ARE ALWAYS ENOUGH LEFT I SHOULD NOT MUCH MIND EXAMINING THE LITTLE GLIMMERING THINGS SOMEWHAT NEARER ESPECIALLY THE MOON FOR THAT WOULD NOT SLIP SO EASILY THROUGH A MAN'S FINGERS WHEN WE DIE
HE STOOD IN THE HANDSOMELY FURNISHED APARTMENT AND HELD BETWEEN HIS FINGERS A SMALL SHEET OF ROSE COLORED PAPER ON WHICH SOME VERSES WERE WRITTEN WRITTEN INDEED BY THE OFFICER HIMSELF
EVERYDAY NECESSITY IS THE STAGNANT POOL OF LIFE NO LOVELY PICTURE REFLECTS ITSELF THEREIN LIEUTENANT LOVE AND LACK OF MONEY THAT IS A SYMBOLIC TRIANGLE OR MUCH THE SAME AS THE HALF OF THE SHATTERED DIE OF FORTUNE
DOST SEE SUCH VERSES AS THESE PEOPLE WRITE WHEN THEY ARE IN LOVE BUT NO MAN IN HIS SENSES EVER THINKS OF PRINTING THEM HERE ONE OF THE SORROWS OF LIFE IN WHICH THERE IS REAL POETRY GAVE ITSELF VENT NOT THAT BARREN GRIEF WHICH THE POET MAY ONLY HINT AT
SOME ONE WILL MAKE A MISTAKE FOR CERTAIN AND TAKE THE WRONG ONES HE WILL BE A HAPPY MAN SUCH WAS THEIR CONVERSATION TWO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COUNCILLOR
I AM VERY SURE I SHOULD MAKE NO SUCH MISERABLE VERSES AS THE OTHERS TODAY METHINKS IS A MOST DELICIOUS DAY FOR A POET NATURE SEEMS ANEW TO CELEBRATE HER AWAKENING INTO LIFE THE AIR IS SO UNUSUALLY CLEAR THE CLOUDS SAIL ON SO BUOYANTLY
WHOM WE HAVE CERTAINLY NOT FORGOTTEN THOUGHT MEANWHILE OF THE GALOSHES HE HAD FOUND AND TAKEN WITH HIM TO THE HOSPITAL
EVERY INCH A MAN RESEMBLING THE REAL PERSONAGES EVEN TO THE FINEST FEATURES AND BECOME THE HEROES OR HEROINES OF OUR WORLD OF DREAMS IN REALITY SUCH REMEMBRANCES ARE RATHER UNPLEASANT EVERY SIN EVERY EVIL THOUGHT MAY LIKE A CLOCK WITH ALARM OR CHIMES
BUT THE SHOES MEANWHILE REMAINED BEHIND FOUR A MOMENT OF HEAD IMPORTANCE AN EVENING'S DRAMATIC READINGS A MOST STRANGE JOURNEY EVERY INHABITANT OF COPENHAGEN KNOWS FROM PERSONAL INSPECTION HOW THE ENTRANCE TO FREDERICK'S HOSPITAL LOOKS
NEVER HAD HIS AGE WITH WHICH HOWEVER HE WAS ALWAYS GRUMBLING SEEMED SO MISERABLE AS ON THIS EVENING I'LL TAKE A HACKNEY COACH THOUGHT HE BUT WHERE WERE THE HACKNEY COACHES NOT ONE WAS TO BE SEEN
AND IF ONE THEN MARKS DOWN ONE'S THOUGHTS POETRY IS PRODUCED
WE SHALL FLY ABOUT AS LIGHT AS A FEATHER FROM ONE SUCH A STAR TO THE OTHER THAT'S OF COURSE NOT TRUE BUT TWOULD BE PRETTY ENOUGH IF IT WERE SO IF I COULD BUT ONCE TAKE A LEAP UP THERE MY BODY MIGHT STAY HERE ON THE STEPS FOR WHAT I CARE
ONLY JUST TELL ME WHERE THE BRIDGE IS SAID HE IT IS REALLY UNPARDONABLE THAT THERE ARE NO LAMPS HERE AND IT IS AS DIRTY AS IF ONE HAD TO WADE THROUGH A MORASS THE LONGER HE SPOKE WITH THE BOATMEN THE MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE DID THEIR LANGUAGE BECOME TO HIM
BE REPEATED AT PLEASURE THEN THE QUESTION IS IF WE CAN TRUST OURSELVES TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF EVERY UNBECOMING WORD IN OUR HEART AND ON OUR LIPS
OH OH I REALLY CANNOT SQUEEZE MYSELF THROUGH HE NOW WANTED TO PULL HIS OVER HASTY HEAD BACK AGAIN BUT HE COULD NOT FOR HIS NECK THERE WAS ROOM ENOUGH BUT FOR NOTHING MORE HIS FIRST FEELING WAS OF ANGER HIS NEXT THAT HIS TEMPER FELL TO ZERO
GAVE ME A KISS I AT THAT TIME WAS RICH IN POESY AND TALES OF OLD THOUGH POOR AS POOR COULD BE BUT ALL SHE ASKED FOR WAS THIS POESY THEN WAS I RICH BUT NOT IN GOLD POOR ME
BUT WHAT SHE HAD YET TO PERFORM WAS SOMETHING QUITE UNUSUAL I MUST TELL YOU SAID SHE
IN WHICH A CERTAIN PAIR OF MAGIC SPECTACLES DID HER ESSENTIAL SERVICE HER NEPHEW A MERRY BOY WHO WAS HIS AUNT'S DARLING BEGGED SO LONG FOR THESE SPECTACLES THAT AT LAST SHE LENT HIM THE TREASURE AFTER HAVING INFORMED HIM WITH MANY EXHORTATIONS
HEM HEM SAID THE CLERK BREATHLESSLY AND QUITE EXHAUSTED HE SEATED HIMSELF ON A BANK
MAY ALSO READ THIS LITTLE WORK WE WILL BEFOREHAND GIVE A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF IT THE EXTENSIVE BUILDING IS SEPARATED FROM THE STREET BY A PRETTY HIGH RAILING THE THICK IRON BARS OF WHICH ARE SO FAR APART THAT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS
OH WERE I RICH OH WERE I RICH SUCH WAS MY WISH YEA SUCH WHEN HARDLY THREE FEET HIGH I LONGED FOR MUCH OH WERE I RICH AN OFFICER WERE I WITH SWORD AND UNIFORM AND PLUME SO HIGH
IT IS EXTREMELY INTERESTING ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE IS A MERE FABLE SUCH METEOROUS APPEARANCES ARE TO BE EXPLAINED IN THIS WAY THAT THEY ARE THE REFLECTIONS OF THE AURORA BOREALIS AND IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THEY ARE CAUSED PRINCIPALLY BY ELECTRICITY
JUST SO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS DO YOU UNDERSTAND SIR LET ME SEE MY RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT ON THE CONTRARY DO NOT LOOK AT HIM BUT AT THIS WHAT IS IT WHAT
UNTIL HE ENTERED HIS BEDROOM SITUATED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE TO THE CLOSED ROOM THEN HE APPROACHED A LITTLE PIECE OF FURNITURE MADE OF ROSEWOOD WHICH HE HAD NOTICED AT A PREVIOUS VISIT THAT CAN ONLY BE TO HOLD GLOVES
AND ACROSS THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE THEN REPRESSING A SLIGHT EMOTION WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN SEEN ON HER COUNTENANCE IF SHE HAD NOT KEPT HER COLOR SHE ASCENDED THE STEPS SAYING TO MORREL SIR
BUT A TRAVELLER BROUGHT HERE BY A CURIOSITY HE HALF REPENTS OF SINCE HE CAUSES YOU TO LOSE YOUR TIME AH MY TIME IS NOT VALUABLE REPLIED THE MAN WITH A MELANCHOLY SMILE
MARVELLOUS ALIKE TO SIGHT AND SMELL WAS A BILLIARD TABLE WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN ABANDONED DURING THE PAST HOUR BY PLAYERS WHO HAD LEFT THE BALLS ON THE CLOTH ONE CHAMBER ALONE HAD BEEN RESPECTED BY THE MAGNIFICENT BERTUCCIO
TAKE THESE AND THE COUNT PLACED THE PACKET IN THE MAN'S HANDS NOW THIS IS NOT ALL HE SAID YOU CANNOT LIVE UPON YOUR FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS I SHALL STILL HAVE MY PLACE NO
BUT PEOPLE WOULD SAY HE WAS AFRAID AND A BRAVE CAPTAIN OF SPAHIS CANNOT RISK THIS EVEN TO GRATIFY A PRETTY WOMAN WHICH IS IN MY OPINION ONE OF THE MOST SACRED OBLIGATIONS IN THE WORLD YOU SEE MY POSITION MADAME
IN A THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR A GARDEN WITH TWO ACRES OF LAND AND A THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR OH HEAVENS COME TAKE THEM AND MONTE CRISTO FORCED THE BANK NOTES INTO HIS HAND WHAT AM I TO DO
AND EMBRACING HIS WIFE AFTER A SHORT TIME THE COUNT SAW BERTUCCIO WHO UNTIL THEN HAD BEEN OCCUPIED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE GLIDE INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM HE WENT TO HIM
THOUGH THEY DO SAY AS FAT AS A DORMOUSE IT IS NOT A WONDER THEY ARE FAT SLEEPING ALL DAY AND ONLY WAKING TO EAT ALL NIGHT LISTEN LAST YEAR I HAD FOUR APRICOTS THEY STOLE ONE
SUCH A QUESTION IT IS THE WORK OF ANOTHER AGE CONSTRUCTED BY THE GENII OF EARTH AND WATER HOW SO AT WHAT PERIOD CAN THAT HAVE BEEN I DO NOT KNOW
LEFT ENRAPTURED SO GREAT SO POWERFUL AND REAL WAS THE INFLUENCE EXERCISED BY THIS MAN OVER ALL WHO SURROUNDED HIM AT PRECISELY SIX O'CLOCK THE CLATTER OF HORSES HOOFS WAS HEARD AT THE ENTRANCE DOOR
AS PALE AS THOUGH HE HAD ISSUED FROM HIS TOMB INSTEAD OF HIS CARRIAGE MADAME DANGLARS THREW A RAPID AND INQUIRING GLANCE WHICH COULD ONLY BE INTERPRETED BY MONTE CRISTO AROUND THE COURT YARD OVER THE PERISTYLE
NOTHING ESCAPED THE COUNT'S NOTICE AND HE OBSERVED A LITTLE NOTE PASSED WITH THE FACILITY THAT INDICATES FREQUENT PRACTICE FROM THE HAND OF MADAME DANGLARS TO THAT OF THE MINISTER'S SECRETARY AFTER HIS WIFE THE BANKER DESCENDED
NOTHING VERY DIFFICULT BUT WHAT IS IT TO REPEAT THESE SIGNS MONTE CRISTO TOOK A PAPER FROM HIS POCKET UPON WHICH WERE DRAWN THREE SIGNS WITH NUMBERS TO INDICATE THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE TO BE WORKED
I THINK SO INDEED HE HAS SIX MILLIONS WORTH HE MUST SELL THEM AT WHATEVER PRICE WHY
PRESERVING THE SEEDS HE HAD LABELLED THEM WITH AS MUCH CARE AS IF HE HAD BEEN MASTER BOTANIST
GLIDING DOWN THE STAIRS RESTORED BUT THE PREVIOUS DAY AS IF THEY HAD ALWAYS INHABITED THE HOUSE OTHERS FILLING THE COACH HOUSES WHERE THE EQUIPAGES ENCASED AND NUMBERED APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN INSTALLED FOR THE LAST FIFTY YEARS
YOU WILL LOSE IT FOR YOU ARE GOING TO ALTER YOUR CORRESPONDENT'S MESSAGE OH SIR WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING A JEST SIR UNLESS YOU FORCE ME
WELL SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO ALTER A SIGNAL AND SUBSTITUTE ANOTHER AH THAT IS ANOTHER CASE I SHOULD BE TURNED OFF AND LOSE MY PENSION THREE HUNDRED FRANCS
THOUSAND FRANCS SIR IT IS NOTHING NO BUT THEN WE ARE LODGED AS YOU PERCEIVE MONTE CRISTO LOOKED AT THE ROOM THEY PASSED TO THE THIRD STORY IT WAS THE TELEGRAPH ROOM
AND FASTENED THE STRING TO THE NAIL AND CAST A LOOK AROUND THE MAN AT THE TELEGRAPH SAID HE MUST EITHER ENGAGE A GARDENER OR DEVOTE HIMSELF PASSIONATELY TO AGRICULTURE
DORMICE ARE BAD NEIGHBORS FOR US WHO DO NOT EAT THEM PRESERVED AS THE ROMANS DID WHAT DID THE ROMANS EAT THEM SAID THE GARDENER ATE DORMICE
AND HAVING TEN MINUTES BEFORE ME AND MY STRAWBERRIES BEING RIPE WHEN A DAY LONGER BY THE BY SIR DO YOU THINK DORMICE EAT THEM INDEED I SHOULD THINK NOT REPLIED MONTE CRISTO
AT FIRST MY NECK WAS CRAMPED WITH LOOKING AT IT BUT AT THE END OF A YEAR I BECAME USED TO IT
LIVED SANG AND BLOOMED LIKE THE HOUSES WE HAVE LONG CHERISHED AND IN WHICH WHEN WE ARE FORCED TO LEAVE THEM WE LEAVE A PART OF OUR SOULS THE SERVANTS PASSED GAYLY ALONG THE FINE COURT YARD SOME BELONGING TO THE KITCHENS
AND ORDERED HIM TO SELL AT ANY PRICE WHEN IT WAS SEEN THAT DANGLARS SOLD THE SPANISH FUNDS FELL DIRECTLY DANGLARS LOST FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS BUT HE RID HIMSELF OF ALL HIS SPANISH SHARES
THE CITIES OF LAMONE AND SANTERNO GOVERNS THE LIONCEL OF THE WHITE LAIR WHO CHANGES SIDES TWIXT SUMMER TIME AND WINTER AND THAT OF WHICH THE SAVIO BATHES THE FLANK EVEN AS IT LIES BETWEEN THE PLAIN AND MOUNTAIN
BUT OPEN WAR I NONE HAVE LEFT THERE NOW RAVENNA STANDS AS IT LONG YEARS HAS STOOD THE EAGLE OF POLENTA THERE IS BROODING SO THAT SHE COVERS CERVIA WITH HER VANS
TO CURE HIM OF THE FEVER OF HIS PRIDE COUNSEL HE ASKED OF ME AND I WAS SILENT BECAUSE HIS WORDS APPEARED INEBRIATE AND THEN HE SAID BE NOT THY HEART AFRAID HENCEFORTH I THEE ABSOLVE
AND TO LICK UP THE MIRROR OF NARCISSUS THOU WOULDST NOT WANT WORDS MANY TO INVITE THEE
WE OF THE OARS MADE WINGS FOR OUR MAD FLIGHT EVERMORE GAINING ON THE LARBOARD SIDE ALREADY ALL THE STARS OF THE OTHER POLE THE NIGHT BEHELD AND OURS SO VERY LOW IT DID NOT RISE ABOVE THE OCEAN FLOOR
AND BEHIND HIM I WENT ALREADY MAKING MY REPLY AND SUPERADDING IN THAT CAVERN WHERE I HELD MINE EYES WITH SUCH ATTENTION FIXED I THINK A SPIRIT OF MY BLOOD LAMENTS THE SIN WHICH DOWN BELOW THERE COSTS SO MUCH THEN SAID THE MASTER
THEN URGED ME ON HIS WEIGHTY ARGUMENTS THERE WHERE MY SILENCE WAS THE WORST ADVICE AND SAID I FATHER SINCE THOU WASHEST ME OF THAT SIN INTO WHICH I NOW MUST FALL
WOULD THAT IT WERE SEEING IT NEEDS MUST BE FOR TWILL AGGRIEVE ME MORE THE MORE I AGE WE WENT OUR WAY AND UP ALONG THE STAIRS THE BOURNS HAD MADE US TO DESCEND BEFORE
WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED WAY UP THROUGH THE POINT GIVING IT THAT VIBRATION THE TONGUE HAD GIVEN THEM IN THEIR PASSAGE OUT WE HEARD IT SAID O THOU AT WHOM I AIM MY VOICE AND WHO BUT NOW WAST SPEAKING LOMBARD SAYING
HAS ME CONDEMNED AND TO THE POET SAID I NOW WAS EVER SO VAIN A PEOPLE AS THE SIENESE NOT FOR A CERTAINTY THE FRENCH BY FAR WHEREAT THE OTHER LEPER WHO HAD HEARD ME REPLIED UNTO MY SPEECH
THIS IS HE AND HE SPEAKS NOT THIS ONE BEING BANISHED EVERY DOUBT SUBMERGED IN CAESAR BY AFFIRMING THE FOREARMED ALWAYS WITH DETRIMENT ALLOWED DELAY
THE SAME WHO GAVE TO THE YOUNG KING THE EVIL COMFORT I MADE THE FATHER AND THE SON REBELLIOUS
AND ALBERT OF SIENA HAD ME BURNED BUT WHAT I DIED FOR DOES NOT BRING ME HERE TIS TRUE I SAID TO HIM SPEAKING IN JEST THAT I COULD RISE BY FLIGHT INTO THE AIR AND HE WHO HAD CONCEIT BUT LITTLE WIT WOULD HAVE ME SHOW TO HIM THE ART AND ONLY BECAUSE NO DAEDALUS I MADE HIM
WHENCE HE ACCUMULATING WOE ON WOE DEPARTED LIKE A PERSON SAD AND CRAZED BUT I REMAINED TO LOOK UPON THE CROWD AND SAW A THING WHICH I SHOULD BE AFRAID WITHOUT SOME FURTHER PROOF EVEN TO RECOUNT
CONSIDER IF TO COUNT THEM THOU BELIEVEST THAT TWO AND TWENTY MILES THE VALLEY WINDS AND NOW THE MOON IS UNDERNEATH OUR FEET HENCEFORTH THE TIME ALLOTTED US IS BRIEF AND MORE IS TO BE SEEN THAN WHAT THOU SEEST
BOTH OF THE SHORES I SAW AS FAR AS SPAIN FAR AS MOROCCO AND THE ISLE OF SARDES AND THE OTHERS WHICH THAT SEA BATHES ROUND ABOUT I AND MY COMPANY WERE OLD AND SLOW
AS I GREW AWARE AS SOON AS I WAS WHERE THE DEPTH APPEARED AND SUCH AS HE WHO WITH THE BEARS AVENGED HIM BEHELD ELIJAH'S CHARIOT AT DEPARTING WHAT TIME THE STEEDS TO HEAVEN ERECT UPROSE
DIVERS LAMENTINGS PIERCED ME THROUGH AND THROUGH WHICH WITH COMPASSION HAD THEIR ARROWS BARBED WHEREAT MINE EARS I COVERED WITH MY HANDS WHAT PAIN WOULD BE IF FROM THE HOSPITALS OF VALDICHIANA
BECAUSE I PARTED PERSONS SO UNITED PARTED DO I NOW BEAR MY BRAIN ALAS FROM ITS BEGINNING WHICH IS IN THIS TRUNK
THAN WAS IT TO BEHOLD THROUGH THAT DARK VALLEY THE SPIRITS LANGUISHING IN DIVERS HEAPS THIS ON THE BELLY THAT UPON THE BACK ONE OF THE OTHER LAY AND OTHERS CRAWLING SHIFTED THEMSELVES ALONG THE DISMAL ROAD
O HOW BEWILDERED UNTO ME APPEARED WITH TONGUE ASUNDER IN HIS WINDPIPE SLIT CURIO WHO IN SPEAKING WAS SO BOLD AND ONE WHO BOTH HIS HANDS DISSEVERED HAD
OR EVER YET AENEAS NAMED IT SO NOR FONDNESS FOR MY SON NOR REVERENCE FOR MY OLD FATHER NOR THE DUE AFFECTION WHICH JOYOUS SHOULD HAVE MADE PENELOPE COULD OVERCOME WITHIN ME THE DESIRE I HAD
IF I DESERVED OF YOU OR MUCH OR LITTLE WHEN IN THE WORLD I WROTE THE LOFTY VERSES DO NOT MOVE ON BUT ONE OF YOU DECLARE WHITHER BEING LOST HE WENT AWAY TO DIE THEN OF THE ANTIQUE FLAME THE GREATER HORN MURMURING
WHERE THE MINISTRESS OF THE HIGH LORD JUSTICE INFALLIBLE PUNISHES FORGERS WHICH SHE HERE RECORDS I DO NOT THINK A SADDER SIGHT TO SEE WAS IN AEGINA THE WHOLE PEOPLE SICK
THEREFORE THYSELF DISBURDEN OF ALL SADNESS AND MAKE ACCOUNT THAT I AM AYE BESIDE THEE IF E'ER IT COME TO PASS THAT FORTUNE BRING THEE WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE IN A LIKE DISPUTE
TWIXT JULY AND SEPTEMBER AND OF MAREMMA AND SARDINIA ALL THE DISEASES IN ONE MOAT WERE GATHERED SUCH WAS IT HERE AND SUCH A STENCH CAME FROM IT AS FROM PUTRESCENT LIMBS IS WONT TO ISSUE
AND I WHO HAD BEFOREHAND MY REPLY IN READINESS FORTHWITH BEGAN TO SPEAK O SOUL THAT DOWN BELOW THERE ART CONCEALED ROMAGNA THINE IS NOT AND NEVER HAS BEEN WITHOUT WAR IN THE BOSOM OF ITS TYRANTS
HE MUST COME DOWN AMONG MY SERVITORS BECAUSE HE GAVE THE FRAUDULENT ADVICE FROM WHICH TIME FORTH I HAVE BEEN AT HIS HAIR FOR WHO REPENTS NOT CANNOT BE ABSOLVED NOR CAN ONE BOTH REPENT AND WILL AT ONCE
THE GENERAL'S GOOD HUMOUR INCREASED WHY AS HE HAD SUCH ROOMS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMPLE NOT TO MAKE USE OF THEM
AND MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AT FIRST HER GREEDY EYE GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER A PAGE SHE STARTED AT ITS IMPORT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE OR DID NOT HER SENSES PLAY HER FALSE AN INVENTORY OF LINEN
SHIRTS STOCKINGS CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH TWO OTHERS PENNED BY THE SAME HAND MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE INTERESTING IN LETTERS HAIR POWDER SHOE STRING AND BREECHES BALL AND THE LARGER SHEET
TO SUPPOSE THAT A MANUSCRIPT OF MANY GENERATIONS BACK COULD HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED IN A ROOM SUCH AS THAT SO MODERN SO HABITABLE
HE SUFFERED THE GIRLS AT LAST TO SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF AN OUTER DOOR AND THEN EXPRESSING HIS WISH TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SOME RECENT ALTERATIONS ABOUT THE TEA HOUSE PROPOSED IT AS NO UNPLEASANT EXTENSION OF THEIR WALK IF MISS MORLAND WERE NOT TIRED
HE WAS ENCHANTED BY HER APPROBATION OF HIS TASTE CONFESSED IT TO BE NEAT AND SIMPLE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURE OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR HIS PART TO HIS UNCRITICAL PALATE THE TEA WAS AS WELL FLAVOURED FROM THE CLAY OF STAFFORDSHIRE
AND HE LED THE WAY TO IT ACROSS A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARK THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN THIS GARDEN WAS SUCH AS CATHERINE COULD NOT LISTEN TO WITHOUT DISMAY BEING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXTENT OF ALL MISTER ALLEN'S AS WELL AS HER FATHER'S INCLUDING CHURCH YARD AND ORCHARD
I COULD HAVE ANSWERED FOR MY COURAGE BUT NOW TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING TO ALARM ONE SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM THE WINDOW CURTAINS SEEMED IN MOTION
SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HENRY LEFT THEM FOR WOODSTON WHERE BUSINESS REQUIRED AND WOULD KEEP HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY ALL ATTENDED IN THE HALL TO SEE HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE AND IMMEDIATELY ON RE ENTERING THE BREAKFAST ROOM CATHERINE WALKED TO A WINDOW IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIS FIGURE
THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE
AND HOW MIGHT YOU LEARN BY ACCIDENT OR ARGUMENT
WAS IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE
AND SAT PALE AND BREATHLESS IN A MOST HUMBLE MOOD CONCERNED FOR HIS CHILDREN AND DETESTING OLD CHESTS AND THE GENERAL RECOVERING HIS POLITENESS AS HE LOOKED AT HER SPENT THE REST OF HIS TIME IN SCOLDING HIS DAUGHTER FOR SO FOOLISHLY HURRYING HER FAIR FRIEND
PUSHED BACK TOO AS IF MEANT TO BE OUT OF SIGHT I WILL LOOK INTO IT COST ME WHAT IT MAY I WILL LOOK INTO IT AND DIRECTLY TOO BY DAYLIGHT IF I STAY TILL EVENING MY CANDLE MAY GO OUT SHE ADVANCED AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY
IT WAS OF CEDAR CURIOUSLY INLAID WITH SOME DARKER WOOD AND RAISED ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND ON A CARVED STAND OF THE SAME THE LOCK WAS SILVER THOUGH TARNISHED FROM AGE
AS SO MANY POOR GIRLS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DO AND THEN TO HAVE A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT FRIGHTENING ONE BY COMING IN WITH A FAGGOT HOW GLAD I AM THAT NORTHANGER IS WHAT IT IS IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE SOME OTHER PLACES I DO NOT KNOW THAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
ALARMED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED SHE TRIED IT ANOTHER WAY A BOLT FLEW AND SHE BELIEVED HERSELF SUCCESSFUL BUT HOW STRANGELY MYSTERIOUS THE DOOR WAS STILL IMMOVABLE SHE PAUSED A MOMENT IN BREATHLESS WONDER
TILL THEY WERE HAPPILY SEATED AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN THE GENERAL'S COMPLACENT SMILES AND A GOOD APPETITE OF HER OWN RESTORED HER TO PEACE THE DINING PARLOUR WAS A NOBLE ROOM
AND FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSE SHE STOOD GAZING ON IT IN MOTIONLESS WONDER WHILE THESE THOUGHTS CROSSED HER
OBSERVED THE GENERAL TO ELEANOR WOODSTON WILL MAKE BUT A SOMBRE APPEARANCE TODAY IS IT A PRETTY PLACE ASKED CATHERINE WHAT SAY YOU ELEANOR SPEAK YOUR OPINION FOR LADIES CAN BEST TELL THE TASTE OF LADIES IN REGARD TO PLACES AS WELL AS MEN
HENRY HAD CERTAINLY BEEN ONLY IN JEST IN WHAT HE HAD TOLD HER THAT MORNING IN A HOUSE SO FURNISHED AND SO GUARDED SHE COULD HAVE NOTHING TO EXPLORE OR TO SUFFER AND MIGHT GO TO HER BEDROOM AS SECURELY AS IF IT HAD BEEN HER OWN CHAMBER AT FULLERTON
BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
STRUCK ON HER AFFRIGHTED EAR HUMAN NATURE COULD SUPPORT NO MORE A COLD SWEAT STOOD ON HER FOREHEAD THE MANUSCRIPT FELL FROM HER HAND AND GROPING HER WAY TO THE BED SHE JUMPED HASTILY IN AND SOUGHT SOME SUSPENSION OF AGONY BY CREEPING FAR UNDERNEATH THE CLOTHES
BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM MADE HER STARTING QUIT HER HOLD AND THE LID CLOSED WITH ALARMING VIOLENCE THIS ILL TIMED INTRUDER WAS MISS TILNEY'S MAID SENT BY HER MISTRESS TO BE OF USE TO MISS MORLAND AND THOUGH CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED HER
CATHERINE HAD NO LEISURE FOR SPEECH BEING AT ONCE BLUSHING TYING HER GOWN AND FORMING WISE RESOLUTIONS WITH THE MOST VIOLENT DISPATCH MISS TILNEY GENTLY HINTED HER FEAR OF BEING LATE AND IN HALF A MINUTE THEY RAN DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER IN AN ALARM NOT WHOLLY UNFOUNDED
WAS SHE A VERY CHARMING WOMAN WAS SHE HANDSOME WAS THERE ANY PICTURE OF HER IN THE ABBEY
OFFERED IT NO INJURY AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK WITH EASY GAIETY OF THE DELIGHTFUL MELANCHOLY WHICH SUCH A GROVE INSPIRED I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF THIS SPOT SAID HER COMPANION WITH A SIGH IT WAS MY MOTHER'S FAVOURITE WALK
AND IN NOT ONE WAS ANYTHING FOUND WELL READ IN THE ART OF CONCEALING A TREASURE THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE LININGS TO THE DRAWERS DID NOT ESCAPE HER AND SHE FELT ROUND EACH WITH ANXIOUS ACUTENESS IN VAIN THE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE ALONE REMAINED NOW UNEXPLORED AND THOUGH SHE HAD
WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
OR IF HE DID NOT HIS FRIENDS AND CHILDREN DID THERE WERE GREAT VEXATIONS HOWEVER ATTENDING SUCH A GARDEN AS HIS
AS IF SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED THE FIRE THEREFORE DIED AWAY AND CATHERINE HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED WHEN ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT
BEHIND HER DEPENDING FROM THE ROOF UPON RAWHIDE THONGS AND STRETCHING ENTIRELY ACROSS THE CAVE WAS A ROW OF HUMAN SKELETONS FROM THE THONG WHICH HELD THEM STRETCHED ANOTHER TO THE DEAD HAND OF THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN
I FELL UPON IT BY CHANCE ONE DAY AS I WAS PASSING ABOVE THE PALACE ON PATROL DUTY IN THIS WORK IT IS REQUIRED THAT WE INVESTIGATE ANY UNUSUAL OCCURRENCE WE MAY WITNESS AND A FACE PEERING FROM THE PINNACLE OF THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE WAS TO ME MOST
HIS FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS RELATED TO THIS MANUSCRIPT WHICH I WAS TO RETAIN SEALED AND UNREAD JUST AS I FOUND IT FOR ELEVEN YEARS NOR WAS I TO DIVULGE ITS CONTENTS UNTIL TWENTY ONE YEARS AFTER HIS DEATH
ASKED TARS TARKAS ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD SEEN ME RUN MY ARM FAR BETWEEN THE GREAT JAWS OF ONE OF MY THOATS WHICH HAD WEDGED A PIECE OF STONE BETWEEN TWO OF HIS TEETH WHILE FEEDING UPON THE MOSS LIKE VEGETATION WITHIN OUR COURT YARD
AND HE ENTERED INTO THE SPORTS OF THE CHILDREN WITH THE SAME HEARTY GOOD FELLOWSHIP HE DISPLAYED TOWARD THOSE PASTIMES IN WHICH THE MEN AND WOMEN OF HIS OWN AGE INDULGED
WHICH BROUGHT ROGUISH DIMPLES TO THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH SHE SHOOK HER HEAD AND CRIED WHAT A CHILD A GREAT WARRIOR AND YET A STUMBLING LITTLE CHILD WHAT HAVE I DONE NOW I ASKED IN SORE PERPLEXITY
GRADUALLY I LEFT MY PURSUERS FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND AND I WAS JUST CONGRATULATING MYSELF ON MY LUCKY ESCAPE
WHICH FAIRLY FORMED A PERFECT LADDER FOR ME ALL THE WAY TO THE EAVES OF THE BUILDING HERE I MET MY FIRST REAL OBSTACLE THE EAVES PROJECTED NEARLY TWENTY FEET FROM THE WALL TO WHICH I CLUNG AND THOUGH I ENCIRCLED THE GREAT BUILDING I COULD FIND NO OPENING THROUGH THEM
IN SUBMITTING CAPTAIN CARTER'S STRANGE MANUSCRIPT TO YOU IN BOOK FORM I BELIEVE THAT A FEW WORDS RELATIVE TO THIS REMARKABLE PERSONALITY WILL BE OF INTEREST MY FIRST RECOLLECTION OF CAPTAIN CARTER IS OF THE FEW MONTHS
BUT I HAVE FOLLOWED THEM TO EACH LAST DETAIL AS FAITHFULLY AS I WAS ABLE HE DIRECTED THAT I REMOVE HIS BODY TO VIRGINIA WITHOUT EMBALMING AND THAT HE BE LAID IN AN OPEN COFFIN WITHIN A TOMB
THEY HAVE HAD ME DOWN IN THE PITS BELOW THE BUILDINGS HELPING THEM MIX THEIR AWFUL RADIUM POWDER AND MAKE THEIR TERRIBLE PROJECTILES YOU KNOW THAT THESE HAVE TO BE MANUFACTURED BY ARTIFICIAL LIGHT
AND HAD THE CHOICE BEEN LEFT TO ME I COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A MORE FITTING MATE FOR THE FIRST PRINCESS OF BARSOOM HERE IS MY HAND UPON YOUR SHOULDER JOHN CARTER AND MY WORD
FOR AS HE LEANED TO PEER OVER THE EAVES I GRASPED HIM BY HIS THROAT AND HIS PISTOL ARM AND THREW HIM HEAVILY TO THE ROOF THE WEAPON DROPPED FROM HIS GRASP AND MY FINGERS CHOKED OFF HIS ATTEMPTED CRY FOR ASSISTANCE I GAGGED AND BOUND HIM
I LOST NO TIME IN EXPLANATION BUT PLUNGED IMMEDIATELY INTO A DISCUSSION OF OUR PLANS FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE
MY FATHER AND I OWNING AND OPERATING A STRING OF GENERAL STORES THROUGHOUT VIRGINIA AT THAT TIME CAPTAIN CARTER HAD A SMALL BUT BEAUTIFUL COTTAGE SITUATED ON A BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE RIVER AND DURING ONE OF MY LAST VISITS IN THE WINTER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE
AND THEN I FOUND TO MY CONSTERNATION THAT A FRAGMENT OF THE PROJECTILE HAD UTTERLY DESTROYED MY ONLY GUIDE AS WELL AS MY SPEEDOMETER IT WAS TRUE I COULD FOLLOW THE STARS IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF HELIUM BUT WITHOUT KNOWING THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE CITY
AND THAT HE HAD BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL WAS EVIDENCED BY THE UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY WITH WHICH HE WAS SUPPLIED
I CAN SOLVE THE DIFFICULTY IN SO FAR AS HELIUM IS CONCERNED BUT FOR PERSONAL REASONS I WOULD PREFER THAT ANOTHER STRUCK THE BLOW THAT FREES DEJAH THORIS KANTOS KAN EYED ME NARROWLY BEFORE HE SPOKE
I WAS EVER A GOOD HAND WITH ANIMALS AND BY INCLINATION AS WELL AS BECAUSE IT BROUGHT MORE LASTING AND SATISFACTORY RESULTS I WAS ALWAYS KIND AND HUMANE IN MY DEALINGS WITH THE LOWER ORDERS
LOVE MAKING ON MARS FOLLOWING THE BATTLE WITH THE AIR SHIPS THE COMMUNITY REMAINED WITHIN THE CITY FOR SEVERAL DAYS ABANDONING THE HOMEWARD MARCH UNTIL THEY COULD FEEL REASONABLY ASSURED THAT THE SHIPS WOULD NOT RETURN
SHOW ME HOW YOU ACCOMPLISH THESE RESULTS WAS TARS TARKAS ONLY REJOINDER AND SO I EXPLAINED AS CAREFULLY AS I COULD THE ENTIRE METHOD OF TRAINING I HAD ADOPTED WITH MY BEASTS AND LATER HE HAD ME REPEAT IT BEFORE LORQUAS PTOMEL AND THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS
THAT SHE SHARED MY SENTIMENTS IN THIS RESPECT I WAS POSITIVE FOR ON MY APPROACH THE LOOK OF PITIFUL HOPELESSNESS LEFT HER SWEET COUNTENANCE TO BE REPLACED BY A SMILE OF JOYFUL WELCOME
ANKLET OF GOLD FROM HIS OWN LEG AS A SIGN OF HIS APPRECIATION OF MY SERVICE TO THE HORDE ON THE SEVENTH DAY FOLLOWING THE BATTLE WITH THE AIR CRAFT WE AGAIN TOOK UP THE MARCH TOWARD THARK ALL PROBABILITY OF ANOTHER ATTACK BEING DEEMED REMOTE
TELLING ME I WOULD FIND HIS WILL THERE AND SOME PERSONAL INSTRUCTIONS WHICH HE HAD ME PLEDGE MYSELF TO CARRY OUT WITH ABSOLUTE FIDELITY AFTER I HAD RETIRED FOR THE NIGHT
LEFT ALONE IN THE STUDY I OPENED THE SAFE AND WITHDREW THE CONTENTS OF THE DRAWER IN WHICH HE HAD TOLD ME I WOULD FIND MY INSTRUCTIONS THEY WERE IN PART PECULIAR INDEED
I HURRIED OUT TO HIS PLACE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT I COULD TAKE CHARGE OF THE BODY AND OF HIS AFFAIRS I FOUND THE WATCHMAN WHO HAD DISCOVERED HIM TOGETHER WITH THE LOCAL POLICE CHIEF AND SEVERAL TOWNSPEOPLE ASSEMBLED IN HIS LITTLE STUDY
AND THEN HUNG HIM OVER THE EDGE OF THE ROOF AS I MYSELF HAD HUNG A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE I KNEW IT WOULD BE MORNING BEFORE HE WOULD BE DISCOVERED AND I NEEDED ALL THE TIME THAT I COULD GAIN DONNING MY TRAPPINGS AND WEAPONS
UNSEEN THE UPPER STORY WHERE OUR APARTMENTS WERE SITUATED WAS THROUGH AN ADJOINING BUILDING AND AFTER CONSIDERABLE MANEUVERING I MANAGED TO ATTAIN THE ROOF OF A SHOP SEVERAL DOORS AWAY LEAPING FROM ROOF TO ROOF
AND ONE HAND I UNLOOSENED ONE OF THE LONG LEATHER STRAPS OF MY TRAPPINGS AT THE END OF WHICH DANGLED A GREAT HOOK BY WHICH AIR SAILORS ARE HUNG TO THE SIDES AND BOTTOMS OF THEIR CRAFT FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES OF REPAIR
AND MASLOVA STEPPED OUT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE CORRIDOR
THE FACT OF HIS SPEAKING ENGLISH FRENCH AND GERMAN WITH A GOOD ACCENT
WHOM AGRAPHENA PETROVNA EXPECTED HIM TO MARRY THIS SUPPOSITION OF HERS ANNOYED NEKHLUDOFF THEN I'LL TELL HER TO WAIT AND AGRAPHENA PETROVNA TOOK A CRUMB BRUSH WHICH WAS NOT IN ITS PLACE
SHE HAD LIVED WITH THE NEKHLUDOFFS FROM THE TIME SHE WAS A CHILD AND HAD KNOWN DMITRI IVANOVITCH AT THE TIME WHEN HE WAS STILL LITTLE MITINKA GOOD MORNING DMITRI IVANOVITCH GOOD MORNING AGRAPHENA PETROVNA
NEKHLUDOFF GAVE HIS NAME AND PASSED INTO THE JURYMEN'S ROOM INSIDE THE ROOM WERE ABOUT TEN PERSONS OF ALL SORTS THEY HAD COME BUT A SHORT WHILE AGO AND SOME WERE SITTING OTHERS WALKING UP AND DOWN
THIS NOTE WAS A CONTINUATION OF THAT SKILFUL MANOEUVRING WHICH THE PRINCESS KORCHAGIN HAD ALREADY PRACTISED FOR TWO MONTHS IN ORDER TO BIND HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER WITH INVISIBLE THREADS AND YET
AND SAID IN A HOARSE VOICE
HAVING REFRESHED HIS FULL WHITE MUSCULAR BODY AND DRIED IT WITH A ROUGH BATH SHEET HE PUT ON HIS FINE UNDERGARMENTS AND HIS BOOTS AND SAT DOWN BEFORE THE GLASS TO BRUSH HIS BLACK BEARD AND HIS CURLY HAIR
THE SIXTH BABY WHOSE FATHER WAS A GIPSY TRAMP WOULD HAVE SHARED THE SAME FATE HAD IT NOT SO HAPPENED THAT ONE OF THE MAIDEN LADIES CAME INTO THE FARMYARD TO SCOLD THE DAIRYMAIDS FOR SENDING UP CREAM THAT SMELT OF THE COW
AND BESIDE THE PLATE LAY THE LAST NUMBER OF THE REVUE DES DEUX MONDES A NEWSPAPER AND SEVERAL LETTERS NEKHLUDOFF WAS JUST GOING TO OPEN HIS LETTERS WHEN A STOUT MIDDLE AGED WOMAN IN MOURNING
THE ELDER A BIG FELLOW WITH MOUSTACHES
AND MANAGED TO SUPPORT HERSELF HER CHILDREN AND HER WRETCHED HUSBAND
THIS UNMARRIED WOMAN HAD A BABY EVERY YEAR AND AS OFTEN HAPPENS AMONG THE VILLAGE PEOPLE
HANDING HIM THE LETTER WITH A SIGNIFICANT SMILE ALL RIGHT DIRECTLY SAID NEKHLUDOFF TAKING THE LETTER AND FROWNING AS HE NOTICED AGRAPHENA PETROVNA'S SMILE THAT SMILE MEANT THAT THE LETTER WAS FROM THE YOUNGER PRINCESS KORCHAGIN
A LIFE WHICH IS LED BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WOMEN AND WHICH IS NOT MERELY TOLERATED BUT SANCTIONED BY THE GOVERNMENT ANXIOUS FOR THE WELFARE OF ITS SUBJECTS
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER AND MAKING EACH OTHER'S ACQUAINTANCE THERE WAS A RETIRED COLONEL IN UNIFORM SOME WERE IN FROCK COATS OTHERS IN MORNING COATS AND ONLY ONE WORE A PEASANT'S DRESS
THAT HAD BEGUN TO GET THIN ABOVE THE FOREHEAD EVERYTHING HE USED EVERYTHING BELONGING TO HIS TOILET HIS LINEN HIS CLOTHES BOOTS NECKTIE PIN
SOPHIA IVANOVNA DRESSED THE LITTLE GIRL IN NICE CLOTHES AND TAUGHT HER TO READ AND WRITE MEANING TO EDUCATE HER LIKE A LADY
IT WAS NOT THIS SPRING MORNING MEN THOUGHT SACRED AND WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION NOT THE BEAUTY OF GOD'S WORLD GIVEN FOR A JOY TO ALL CREATURES THIS BEAUTY WHICH INCLINES THE HEART TO PEACE
IT WAS NOT THE FACT THAT MEN AND ANIMALS HAD RECEIVED THE GRACE AND GLADNESS OF SPRING THAT WAS CONSIDERED SACRED AND IMPORTANT BUT THAT A NOTICE NUMBERED AND WITH A SUPERSCRIPTION HAD COME THE DAY BEFORE
SHE WORE LINEN STOCKINGS AND PRISON SHOES AND ROUND HER HEAD WAS TIED A WHITE KERCHIEF FROM UNDER WHICH A FEW LOCKS OF BLACK HAIR WERE BRUSHED OVER THE FOREHEAD
BEFORE PROCEEDING TO JOIN HIS REGIMENT
HAVING EVIDENTLY THROWN HER UP AND KATUSHA REMAINED ALONE SHE MEANT TO CONTINUE LIVING IN THE LODGING BY HERSELF
BUT SEEING WHAT A LIFE OF MISERY AND HARDSHIP HER AUNT'S ASSISTANTS LED KATUSHA HESITATED AND APPLIED TO A REGISTRY OFFICE
TRADESPEOPLE COOKS
INFECTED KATUSHA AND HER BABY BOY HAD TO BE SENT TO THE FOUNDLINGS HOSPITAL
AND FARM ALL THE LAND NOW RENTED BY THE PEASANTS THEMSELVES THE STEWARD WROTE THAT THIS WOULD BE A FAR MORE PROFITABLE WAY OF MANAGING THE PROPERTY
WITHOUT BEING PAID HER WAGES
HER SMALL BROAD HANDS AND FULL NECK WHICH SHOWED FROM UNDER THE BROAD COLLAR OF HER CLOAK WERE OF THE SAME HUE HER BLACK SPARKLING EYES ONE WITH A SLIGHT SQUINT
THE WOMAN RECEIVED HER VERY KINDLY SET CAKE AND SWEET WINE BEFORE HER THEN WROTE A NOTE AND GAVE IT TO A SERVANT TO TAKE TO SOMEBODY IN THE EVENING A TALL MAN WITH LONG GREY HAIR AND A WHITE BEARD
HE GAVE HER ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE ROUBLES AND OFFERED HER A SEPARATE LODGING NEXT DOOR TO THE LODGING RENTED FOR HER BY THE AUTHOR THERE LIVED A JOLLY YOUNG SHOPMAN WITH WHOM KATUSHA SOON FELL IN LOVE SHE TOLD THE AUTHOR
MOREOVER HE HAD FORMED LUXURIOUS HABITS WHICH HE COULD NOT EASILY GIVE UP BESIDES HE HAD NO LONGER THE SAME INDUCEMENTS
AT THE IMPORTANT DEBATES CONCERNING THE SCHOOLS AND THE ROADS AS A STRONG OPPOSITION BY THE REACTIONARY PARTY WAS EXPECTED THE MARECHAL WAS A LIBERAL AND WAS QUITE ENGROSSED IN THIS FIGHT
AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO A SMALL YOUNG WOMAN WITH A VERY FULL BUST CAME BRISKLY OUT OF THE DOOR AND WENT UP TO THE JAILER SHE HAD ON A GREY CLOAK OVER A WHITE JACKET AND PETTICOAT ON HER FEET
ALL WERE GLAD THE PLANTS THE BIRDS THE INSECTS AND THE CHILDREN BUT MEN GROWN UP MEN AND WOMEN DID NOT LEAVE OFF CHEATING AND TORMENTING THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER
TO THE PEASANTS INHERITING HIS MOTHER'S LARGE ESTATES AND THUS BECOMING A LANDED PROPRIETOR HE HAD TO CHOOSE ONE OF TWO THINGS EITHER TO GIVE UP HIS PROPERTY AS HE HAD GIVEN UP HIS FATHER'S LAND TEN YEARS BEFORE
AND THERE HE SAW TOM SITTING ON A BENCH AND BLOWING ON A WHISTLE MADE FROM A PIG'S TAIL WHERE DID YOU GET THAT TAIL ASKED THE FARMER I FOUND IT SAID NAUGHTY TOM BEGINNING TO BE FRIGHTENED LET ME SEE IT DEMANDED THE FARMER
AS MY SISTERS HAD EVIDENTLY BECOME ATTACHED TO YOU AND YOUR SOCIETY GAVE THEM UNUSUAL PLEASURE I DEEMED IT INEXPEDIENT TO BREAK IN ON YOUR MUTUAL COMFORT TILL THEIR APPROACHING DEPARTURE FROM MARSH END SHOULD RENDER YOURS NECESSARY
BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THE WINTER IN WINTER WE RABBITS SAID BUNNY SO SHY KEEP WATCH TO SEE SANTA GO GALLOPING BY AND DO YOU EVER SEE HIM ASKED THE GIRL EAGERLY OH YES EVERY WINTER
I SCARCELY KNOW IN WHICH LIGHT HE REGARDED IT SOMETIMES WHEN THE DAY WAS VERY UNFAVOURABLE HIS SISTERS WOULD EXPOSTULATE HE WOULD THEN SAY WITH A PECULIAR SMILE MORE SOLEMN THAN CHEERFUL
AND THEY LIVED ALL ALONE IN A LITTLE HUT AWAY AT THE END OF THE VILLAGE STREET FOR TOM'S MOTHER HAD DIED WHEN HE WAS A BABY YOU MAY NOT SUPPOSE THAT TOM WAS A VERY GOOD BOY SINCE HE HAD SUCH A QUEER FATHER BUT NEITHER WAS HE VERY BAD
AND HER CUPBOARD IS NEVER BARE NOW I CAN PROMISE YOU AT THE TOP OF THE CASTLE THERE IS ONE BIG ROOM AND THAT IS SANTA'S WORK SHOP WHERE HE MAKES THE TOYS ON ONE SIDE IS HIS WORK BENCH WITH PLENTY OF SAWS AND HAMMERS AND JACK KNIVES
BUT NO TRACES OF THE PIG COULD HE FIND ANYWHERE AND THAT WAS NO GREAT WONDER FOR THE PIG WAS EATEN BY THAT TIME AND ITS BONES PICKED CLEAN FINALLY THE FARMER CAME TO THE END OF THE STREET WHERE THE PIPER LIVED IN HIS LITTLE HUT
AND BEING THE ONLY CHILD UPON THE FARM SHE WAS ALLOWED TO ROAM ABOUT THE MEADOWS AND WOODS AS SHE PLEASED ON THE BRIGHT SUMMER MORNINGS DOROTHY'S MOTHER WOULD TIE A SUN BONNET UNDER THE GIRL'S CHIN
UNTIL THE RABBIT BECAME REASSURED AND BLINKED HIS BIG EYES AT HER THOUGHTFULLY FOR HE WAS AS MUCH INTERESTED IN THE LITTLE GIRL AS SHE IN HIM SINCE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DARED TO MEET A PERSON FACE TO FACE
AND BEGAN TO MAKE A WHISTLE OUT OF THE PIG'S TAIL WITH HIS POCKET KNIFE NOW FARMER BOWSER WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SAWING THE WOOD FOUND IT WAS TIME TO FEED THE PIG SO HE TOOK A PAIL OF MEAL AND WENT TO THE PIGSTY
STILL AS THEY WOULD ABUSE A LIVE RABBIT I THINK I SHALL MAKE THEM SOME TOY RABBITS WHICH THEY CANNOT HURT SO IF YOU WILL JUMP INTO MY SLEIGH WITH ME AND RIDE HOME TO MY CASTLE FOR A FEW DAYS I LL SEE IF I CAN'T MAKE SOME TOY RABBITS JUST LIKE YOU
BUT THE FIRST GUSH OF VIVACITY AND FLUENCY GONE I WAS FAIN TO SIT ON A STOOL AT DIANA'S FEET TO REST MY HEAD ON HER KNEE AND LISTEN ALTERNATELY TO HER AND MARY WHILE THEY SOUNDED THOROUGHLY THE TOPIC ON WHICH I HAD BUT TOUCHED
ITS AVENUE OF AGED FIRS ALL GROWN ASLANT UNDER THE STRESS OF MOUNTAIN WINDS ITS GARDEN DARK WITH YEW AND HOLLY AND WHERE NO FLOWERS BUT OF THE HARDIEST SPECIES WOULD BLOOM FOUND A CHARM BOTH POTENT AND PERMANENT
SANTA NEVER FORGETS ME AND EVERY TIME HE PASSES HE CALLS OUT IN HIS JOLLY VOICE A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU BUN RABBIT THE BABIES STILL LOVE YOU DEARLY THE RABBIT PAUSED AND DOROTHY WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION
STERN ALLUSIONS TO CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ELECTION PREDESTINATION REPROBATION WERE FREQUENT AND EACH REFERENCE TO THESE POINTS SOUNDED LIKE A SENTENCE PRONOUNCED FOR DOOM
THE ROOMS ARE BIG AND HIGH AND THERE IS A SOFT CARPET UPON EVERY FLOOR AND MANY STRANGE THINGS SCATTERED AROUND TO AMUSE ONE SANTA CLAUS LIVES THERE ALL ALONE EXCEPT FOR OLD MOTHER HUBBARD WHO COOKS THE MEALS FOR HIM
BUT HE WAS SO SLY AND CAUTIOUS THAT NO ONE HAD EVER CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT OF STEALING ALTHOUGH A GOOD MANY THINGS HAD BEEN MISSED AFTER THEY HAD FALLEN INTO THE OLD MAN'S WAY BARNEY HAD ONE SON NAMED TOM
BUT THEN YOU SEE I HAVE BEEN MAKING TOYS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND I MAKE SO MANY IT IS NO WONDER I AM SKILLFUL AND NOW IF YOU ARE READY TO GO HOME I LL HITCH UP THE REINDEER AND TAKE YOU BACK AGAIN
REGRETS TO WHICH I HAVE LATTERLY AVOIDED REFERRING BUT WHICH POSSESSED ME AND TYRANNISED OVER ME RUTHLESSLY MEANTIME A MONTH WAS GONE
UNDER HIS FATHER'S GUIDANCE HE FELL INTO BAD WAYS ONE MORNING TOM TOM THE PIPER'S SON WAS HUNGRY WHEN THE DAY BEGUN HE WANTED A BUN AND ASKED FOR ONE BUT SOON FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE NONE
SO AFTER MOTHER HUBBARD HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD MEAL OF TURNIPS AND SLICED CABBAGE SANTA CLAUS PUT THE MAGIC COLLAR AROUND MY NECK AND I STARTED FOR HOME I TOOK MY TIME ON THE JOURNEY FOR I KNEW NOTHING COULD HARM ME
AND THEN HE STUFFED THE FUR FULL OF SAWDUST AND SEWED IT UP NEATLY AFTER WHICH HE PUT IN SOME GLASS EYES THAT MADE THE TOY RABBIT LOOK WONDERFULLY LIFE LIKE WHEN IT WAS ALL DONE HE PUT IT ON THE TABLE BESIDE ME
AND DID NOT LIKE TO CRUSH THE PRETTY FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED IN HER PATH AND SHE WAS ALSO VERY FOND OF ALL THE ANIMALS AND LEARNED TO KNOW THEM WELL AND EVEN TO UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE WHICH VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN DO AND THE ANIMALS LOVED DOROTHY IN TURN
THE PIG WAS EAT AND TOM WAS BEAT AND TOM RAN CRYING DOWN THE STREET
FOR THE WORD PASSED AROUND AMONGST THEM THAT SHE COULD BE TRUSTED TO DO THEM NO HARM FOR THE HORSE WHOSE SOFT NOSE DOROTHY OFTEN GENTLY STROKED TOLD THE COW OF HER KINDNESS AND THE COW TOLD THE DOG AND THE DOG TOLD THE CAT
YOU SEE WE HAVE ONLY OUR EYES AND OUR EARS AND OUR LEGS TO DEFEND OURSELVES WITH WE CANNOT FIGHT BUT WE CAN ALWAYS RUN AWAY AND THAT IS A MUCH BETTER WAY TO SAVE OUR LIVES THAN BY FIGHTING WHERE IS YOUR HOME BUNNY ENQUIRED THE GIRL

HE THAT IS ONCE ADMITTED TO THE RIGHT OF REASON IS MADE A FREEMAN OF THE WHOLE ESTATE WHAT PLATO HAS THOUGHT HE MAY THINK WHAT A SAINT HAS FELT HE MAY FEEL

YET SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED SINCE LAST NIGHT TO START HIM OFF I'M CLEAN PUZZLED THAT'S WHAT AND I WON'T KNOW A MINUTE'S PEACE OF MIND OR CONSCIENCE UNTIL I KNOW WHAT HAS TAKEN MATTHEW CUTHBERT OUT OF AVONLEA TODAY ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA MISSUS RACHEL SET OUT SHE HAD NOT FAR TO GO
MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT THE CHIN WAS VERY POINTED AND PRONOUNCED THAT THE BIG EYES WERE FULL OF SPIRIT AND VIVACITY THAT THE MOUTH WAS SWEET LIPPED AND EXPRESSIVE THAT THE FOREHEAD WAS BROAD AND FULL IN SHORT OUR DISCERNING EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE CONCLUDED
THE ORCHARD ON THE SLOPE BELOW THE HOUSE WAS IN A BRIDAL FLUSH OF PINKY WHITE BLOOM HUMMED OVER BY A MYRIAD OF BEES THOMAS LYNDE A MEEK LITTLE MAN WHOM AVONLEA PEOPLE CALLED RACHEL LYNDE'S HUSBAND WAS SOWING HIS LATE TURNIP SEED ON THE HILL FIELD BEYOND THE BARN
MY BUT I PITY HIM THAT'S WHAT SO SAID MISSUS RACHEL TO THE WILD ROSE BUSHES OUT OF THE FULNESS OF HER HEART
WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF LIKE MOST QUIET FOLKS HE LIKED TALKATIVE PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE WILLING TO DO THE TALKING THEMSELVES AND DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO KEEP UP HIS END OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO ENJOY THE SOCIETY OF A LITTLE GIRL WOMEN WERE BAD ENOUGH IN ALL CONSCIENCE BUT LITTLE GIRLS WERE WORSE
THIN WOMAN WITH ANGLES AND WITHOUT CURVES HER DARK HAIR SHOWED SOME GRAY STREAKS AND WAS ALWAYS TWISTED UP IN A HARD LITTLE KNOT BEHIND WITH TWO WIRE HAIRPINS STUCK AGGRESSIVELY THROUGH IT SHE LOOKED LIKE A WOMAN OF NARROW EXPERIENCE AND RIGID CONSCIENCE WHICH SHE WAS
MISSUS RACHEL WOULD HAVE LIKED TO STAY UNTIL MATTHEW CAME HOME WITH HIS IMPORTED ORPHAN BUT REFLECTING THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD TWO HOURS AT LEAST BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL SHE CONCLUDED TO GO UP THE ROAD TO ROBERT BELL'S AND TELL THE NEWS IT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE A SENSATION SECOND TO NONE
ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL WHAT DID THAT TREE LEANING OUT FROM THE BANK ALL WHITE AND LACY MAKE YOU THINK OF SHE ASKED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW WHY A BRIDE OF COURSE A BRIDE ALL IN WHITE WITH A LOVELY MISTY VEIL
AND ALTHOUGH HE FOUND IT RATHER DIFFICULT FOR HIS SLOWER INTELLIGENCE TO KEEP UP WITH HER BRISK MENTAL PROCESSES
BARELY VISIBLE FROM THE MAIN ROAD ALONG WHICH ALL THE OTHER AVONLEA HOUSES WERE SO SOCIABLY SITUATED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE DID NOT CALL LIVING IN SUCH A PLACE LIVING AT ALL IT'S JUST STAYING THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID AS SHE STEPPED ALONG THE DEEP RUTTED GRASSY LANE
WHAT ON EARTH PUT SUCH A NOTION INTO YOUR HEAD SHE DEMANDED DISAPPROVINGLY THIS HAD BEEN DONE WITHOUT HER ADVICE BEING ASKED AND MUST PERFORCE BE DISAPPROVED WELL WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR SOME TIME ALL WINTER IN FACT RETURNED MARILLA
WHENCE YOU GOT A GLIMPSE OF THE BLOOM WHITE CHERRY TREES IN THE LEFT ORCHARD AND NODDING SLENDER BIRCHES DOWN IN THE HOLLOW BY THE BROOK WAS GREENED OVER BY A TANGLE OF VINES HERE SAT MARILLA CUTHBERT WHEN SHE SAT AT ALL ALWAYS SLIGHTLY DISTRUSTFUL OF SUNSHINE
OR WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEERFUL IF IT HAD NOT BEEN SO PAINFULLY CLEAN AS TO GIVE IT SOMETHING OF THE APPEARANCE OF AN UNUSED PARLOR ITS WINDOWS LOOKED EAST AND WEST THROUGH THE WEST ONE LOOKING OUT ON THE BACK YARD CAME A FLOOD OF MELLOW JUNE SUNLIGHT BUT THE EAST ONE
I DO LOVE TO IMAGINE I'M NICE AND PLUMP WITH DIMPLES IN MY ELBOWS WITH THIS MATTHEW'S COMPANION STOPPED TALKING PARTLY BECAUSE SHE WAS OUT OF BREATH AND PARTLY BECAUSE THEY HAD REACHED THE BUGGY NOT ANOTHER WORD DID SHE SAY UNTIL THEY HAD LEFT THE VILLAGE AND WERE DRIVING DOWN A STEEP LITTLE HILL
WHO HAD BEEN STOLEN AWAY FROM HER PARENTS IN HER INFANCY BY A CRUEL NURSE WHO DIED BEFORE SHE COULD CONFESS I USED TO LIE AWAKE AT NIGHTS AND IMAGINE THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE TIME IN THE DAY I GUESS THAT'S WHY I'M SO THIN I AM DREADFUL THIN AIN'T I THERE ISN'T A PICK ON MY BONES
AND HIS BEST SUIT OF CLOTHES WHICH WAS PLAIN PROOF THAT HE WAS GOING OUT OF AVONLEA AND HE HAD THE BUGGY AND THE SORREL MARE WHICH BETOKENED THAT HE WAS GOING A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE NOW WHERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT GOING AND WHY WAS HE GOING THERE
MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER WAS UP HERE ONE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO GET A LITTLE GIRL FROM THE ASYLUM OVER IN HOPETON IN THE SPRING
BUT I'D RATHER BELIEVE THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE KINDNESS OF HIS HEART WOULDN'T YOU WHEN WE GOT ON THE TRAIN I FELT AS IF EVERYBODY MUST BE LOOKING AT ME AND PITYING ME BUT I JUST WENT TO WORK AND IMAGINED THAT I HAD ON THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PALE BLUE SILK DRESS BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE IMAGINING YOU MIGHT AS WELL IMAGINE SOMETHING WORTH WHILE
SHE WAS ACTUALLY STRICKEN DUMB FOR FIVE SECONDS IT WAS UNSUPPOSABLE THAT MARILLA WAS MAKING FUN OF HER BUT MISSUS RACHEL WAS ALMOST FORCED TO SUPPOSE IT ARE YOU IN EARNEST MARILLA SHE DEMANDED WHEN VOICE RETURNED TO HER YES OF COURSE
ONLY DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU IF HE BURNS GREEN GABLES DOWN OR PUTS STRYCHNINE IN THE WELL I HEARD OF A CASE OVER IN NEW BRUNSWICK WHERE AN ORPHAN ASYLUM CHILD DID THAT AND THE WHOLE FAMILY DIED IN FEARFUL AGONIES ONLY IT WAS A GIRL IN THAT INSTANCE WELL WE'RE NOT GETTING A GIRL SAID MARILLA
HE THOUGHT HE WAS TOO EARLY SO HE TIED HIS HORSE IN THE YARD OF THE SMALL BRIGHT RIVER HOTEL AND WENT OVER TO THE STATION HOUSE THE LONG PLATFORM WAS ALMOST DESERTED THE ONLY LIVING CREATURE IN SIGHT BEING A GIRL WHO WAS SITTING ON A PILE OF SHINGLES AT THE EXTREME END
AND I KNOW ANOTHER CASE WHERE AN ADOPTED BOY USED TO SUCK THE EGGS THEY COULDN'T BREAK HIM OF IT IF YOU HAD ASKED MY ADVICE IN THE MATTER WHICH YOU DIDN'T DO MARILLA I'D HAVE SAID FOR MERCY'S SAKE NOT TO THINK OF SUCH A THING THAT'S WHAT
PETER HAD ASKED HIM OF COURSE FOR MATTHEW CUTHBERT HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO VOLUNTEER INFORMATION ABOUT ANYTHING IN HIS WHOLE LIFE AND YET HERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT AT HALF PAST THREE ON THE AFTERNOON OF A BUSY DAY PLACIDLY DRIVING OVER THE HOLLOW AND UP THE HILL
HER FACE WAS SMALL WHITE AND THIN ALSO MUCH FRECKLED HER MOUTH WAS LARGE AND SO WERE HER EYES WHICH LOOKED GREEN IN SOME LIGHTS AND MOODS AND GRAY IN OTHERS SO FAR THE ORDINARY OBSERVER AN EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER
MARILLA AND MATTHEW CUTHBERT OF ALL PEOPLE ADOPTING A BOY FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM WELL THE WORLD WAS CERTAINLY TURNING UPSIDE DOWN SHE WOULD BE SURPRISED AT NOTHING AFTER THIS NOTHING
IS ALTERNATELY A LEAD COLOURED VIEW AND A VIEW IN INDIAN INK THE VASES ON THE STONE TERRACE IN THE FOREGROUND CATCH THE RAIN ALL DAY AND THE HEAVY DROPS FALL DRIP DRIP DRIP
HE IS SURROUNDED BY A MYSTERIOUS HALO OF FAMILY CONFIDENCES OF WHICH HE IS KNOWN TO BE THE SILENT DEPOSITORY
AITS AND MEADOWS FOG DOWN THE RIVER WHERE IT ROLLS DEFILED AMONG THE TIERS OF SHIPPING AND THE WATERSIDE POLLUTIONS OF A GREAT AND DIRTY CITY FOG ON THE ESSEX MARSHES FOG ON THE KENTISH HEIGHTS
ARTICLED CLERKS HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF FLESHING THEIR LEGAL WIT UPON IT THE LAST LORD CHANCELLOR HANDLED IT NEATLY
HIS FAMILY IS AS OLD AS THE HILLS AND INFINITELY MORE RESPECTABLE HE HAS A GENERAL OPINION THAT THE WORLD MIGHT GET ON WITHOUT HILLS BUT WOULD BE DONE UP WITHOUT DEDLOCKS
THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT IS CALLED SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION HAS BEEN DENIED SINCE THE DEATH OF MISTER KROOK AND MY GOOD FRIEND MISTER LEWES
AND IT KNOWS ALL FASHIONABLE THINGS TO KNOW THINGS OTHERWISE WERE TO BE UNFASHIONABLE MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS BEEN DOWN AT WHAT SHE CALLS IN FAMILIAR CONVERSATION
INTO THE FREEZING MOOD AN EXHAUSTED COMPOSURE A WORN OUT PLACIDITY AN EQUANIMITY OF FATIGUE NOT TO BE RUFFLED BY INTEREST OR SATISFACTION ARE THE TROPHIES OF HER VICTORY
THAN WHEN IT WAS BEGUN
THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR OUGHT TO BE SITTING HERE AS HERE HE IS WITH A FOGGY GLORY ROUND HIS HEAD SOFTLY FENCED IN WITH CRIMSON CLOTH AND CURTAINS ADDRESSED
DOWN IN HIS CLOSE CABIN FOG CRUELLY PINCHING THE TOES AND FINGERS OF HIS SHIVERING LITTLE PRENTICE BOY ON DECK
TO WHAT IT WORKS IN LIKE THE DYER'S HAND PITY ME THEN AND WISH I WERE RENEWED BUT AS IT IS WHOLESOME THAT THE PARSIMONIOUS PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW
AND REMARKS IN COMMENDATION OF HER HAIR ESPECIALLY THAT SHE IS THE BEST GROOMED WOMAN IN THE WHOLE STUD WITH ALL HER PERFECTIONS ON HER HEAD MY LADY DEDLOCK HAS COME UP FROM HER PLACE IN LINCOLNSHIRE
AND ALWAYS EXPECTING SOME INCOMPREHENSIBLE JUDGMENT TO BE GIVEN IN HER FAVOUR
TO MEET THE SHINING FIGURE OF A WRAPPED UP MAN COMING THROUGH THE GATE HAS BEEN PUT QUITE OUT OF TEMPER MY LADY DEDLOCK SAYS SHE HAS BEEN BORED TO DEATH
AS ONE OF A COMPANY OF SOME HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN AND WOMEN NOT LABOURING UNDER ANY SUSPICIONS OF LUNACY THAT THE COURT OF CHANCERY THOUGH THE SHINING SUBJECT OF MUCH POPULAR PREJUDICE
THE MOST IS MADE AS THE HONOURABLE BOB STABLES HAS FREQUENTLY ASSERTED UPON OATH OF ALL HER POINTS THE SAME AUTHORITY OBSERVES THAT SHE IS PERFECTLY GOT UP
TO ADDRESS THE CHANCELLOR AT THE CLOSE OF THE DAY'S BUSINESS AND WHO CAN BY NO MEANS BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHANCELLOR IS LEGALLY IGNORANT OF HIS EXISTENCE AFTER MAKING IT DESOLATE
BUT IMPROVED INTO CLASSICALITY BY THE ACQUIRED EXPRESSION OF HER FASHIONABLE STATE HER FIGURE IS ELEGANT AND HAS THE EFFECT OF BEING TALL NOT THAT SHE IS SO BUT THAT
RINGING IN THE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF THE VERY LITTLE COUNSEL DROPS AND THE FOG KNOWS HIM NO MORE EVERYBODY LOOKS FOR HIM NOBODY CAN SEE HIM I WILL SPEAK WITH BOTH THE YOUNG PEOPLE
WITH ANY MORE BUT SHE HAD BEAUTY PRIDE AMBITION INSOLENT RESOLVE AND SENSE ENOUGH TO PORTION OUT A LEGION OF FINE LADIES WEALTH AND STATION ADDED TO THESE SOON FLOATED HER UPWARD
BUT THIS WAS EXAGGERATED AND HAD BEEN ENTIRELY OWING TO THE PARSIMONY OF THE PUBLIC WHICH GUILTY PUBLIC IT APPEARED HAD BEEN UNTIL LATELY BENT IN THE MOST DETERMINED MANNER
ON BY NO MEANS ENLARGING THE NUMBER OF CHANCERY JUDGES APPOINTED I BELIEVE BY RICHARD THE SECOND BUT ANY OTHER KING WILL DO AS WELL THIS SEEMED TO ME TOO PROFOUND A JOKE TO BE INSERTED IN THE BODY OF THIS BOOK
IT HAS BEEN DEATH TO MANY BUT IT IS A JOKE IN THE PROFESSION EVERY MASTER IN CHANCERY HAS HAD A REFERENCE OUT OF IT EVERY CHANCELLOR WAS IN IT FOR SOMEBODY OR OTHER WHEN HE WAS COUNSEL AT THE BAR
LUDSHIP IS THE REPLY THAT SLIDES OUT OF MISTER TANGLE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE BAR ARE STILL TO BE HEARD I BELIEVE SAYS THE CHANCELLOR WITH A SLIGHT SMILE
SMOKE LOWERING DOWN FROM CHIMNEY POTS MAKING A SOFT BLACK DRIZZLE WITH FLAKES OF SOOT IN IT AS BIG AS FULL GROWN SNOWFLAKES GONE INTO MOURNING ONE MIGHT IMAGINE FOR THE DEATH OF THE SUN
THE SUBJECT WAS A WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND WAS IGNORANTLY CONVICTED OF HAVING MURDERED HER BUT ON SOLEMN APPEAL TO A HIGHER COURT HE WAS ACQUITTED BECAUSE IT WAS SHOWN UPON THE EVIDENCE
FOG CREEPING INTO THE CABOOSES OF COLLIER BRIGS FOG LYING OUT ON THE YARDS AND HOVERING IN THE RIGGING OF GREAT SHIPS FOG DROOPING ON THE GUNWALES OF BARGES AND SMALL BOATS
FOR SAINT THOMAS WHICH WAS A BRITISH NAVAL STATION AND WHERE HE DECLARED HE WAS GOING IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A COMMISSION AS A PRIVATEER NOW THE WILY
AND SUCH A PLACE IS LAND'S END NEAR THE GOLDEN GATE IN SAN FRANCISCO WE STARTED DOWN THE STEEP INCLINE STREWN WITH JAGGED ROCKS
HAVING NO INTENTION OF RESPECTING HIS OATHS OR OF KEEPING HIS PROMISES HE THOUGHT THAT AS HE WAS GOING TO BE DISLOYAL HE MIGHT AS WELL BE AS DISLOYAL
GLEAMING LIKE SPARKS OF FIRE AMID THE GREEN AND BRONZE FOLIAGE IT GLIDES AT LAST INTO A SOMBER CANON
THERE A BRIDGE SPANS THE BROOK THAT GURGLES ITS ELFIN SONG TO CHEER THE DUSTY TRAVELER ON ITS WAY THE LAUREL MADRONE AND MANZANITAS
SOME PREFER THE SMOOTH STRETCH OF SANDY BEACH WHERE ONE MAY LIE AT LUXURIOUS EASE IN THE WARM SAND AND LISTEN TO THE WAVES LAPPING ALONG SHORE OR DISCARDING SHOES AND STOCKINGS
TO WRITE THAT BEAUTIFUL POEM CONTAINING THE LINES LET ME LIVE IN A HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND BE A FRIEND TO MAN FOR THE COOLING DRAUGHT PASSED OUT TO ME ONE HOT AFTERNOON FROM THIS HOUSE
A VERY NATURAL THING FOR THE GREEN HAND BONNET TO GIVE UP PIRATING AFTER HE HAD BEEN SO THOROUGHLY SNUBBED BY BLACKBEARD AND THEY HAD NOT SUPPOSED THAT HE WOULD EVER THINK AGAIN OF SAILING UNDER A BLACK FLAG
AFTER A TIME BONNET PUT INTO A NORTH CAROLINA PORT IN ORDER TO REPAIR THE ROYAL JAMES WHICH WAS BECOMING VERY LEAKY AND SEEING NO IMMEDIATE LEGITIMATE WAY OF GETTING PLANKS AND BEAMS
CHAFING AND FUMING FOR A CHANCE OF A HAND TO HAND CONFLICT WITH THE GREATEST PIRATE OF THE DAY
I AM TOLD BY ONE WHO OUGHT TO KNOW FOR HE IS AN OLD RESIDENT THAT IF YOU FOLLOW ITS TORTUOUS COURSE FAR ENOUGH IT WILL LEAD YOU TO A TOWN CALLED
AMONG WHICH WAS THE FAMOUS EXPEDITION TO THE HARBOR OF CHARLES TOWN WHERE BLACKBEARD TRADED MISTER WRAGG AND HIS COMPANIONS
HE KNEW OF A DESERT ISLAND NOT VERY FAR AWAY WHERE BLACKBEARD AT THE END OF HIS LAST CRUISE HAD MAROONED A LARGE PARTY OF HIS MEN THIS HEARTLESS PIRATE HAD NOT WANTED TO TAKE ALL OF HIS FOLLOWERS INTO PORT
BUT THE ROAD DOES NOT STOP TO LOOK OR LISTEN AND ONCE MORE IT CLIMBS THE HILL WHERE THE GOLDEN POPPY BASKS IN THE SUNSHINE AND THE DANDELIONS SPREAD THEIR YELLOW CARPET FOR IT TO PASS OVER
NEVER BEFORE HAD HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REVENGING HIMSELF ON ANYBODY BUT NOW THAT HOUR HAD ARRIVED HE WOULD REVENGE HIMSELF UPON BLACKBEARD THE IMPLACABLE BONNET SAILED OUT TO SEA
AND BLOW EVERY HOUSE INTO SPLINTERS OF COURSE THE CITIZENS HAVING NO WAY OF DEFENDING THEMSELVES WERE OBLIGED TO ALLOW THE PIRATES TO COME ON SHORE AND DEPART UNMOLESTED
IS A DEEP DARK CAVERN EVIDENTLY WORN BY THE ACTION OF THE WAVES THAT HAVE POUNDED AGAINST IT FOR CENTURIES LOOKING OUT UPON THE OCEAN WE SEE A WAVE MIGHTIER THAN ALL THE OTHERS
AND HE PROCEEDED TO PROVE THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN BRANCHES OF THE PIRATICAL BUSINESS
ENOUGH WITH WHICH TO MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS HE CAPTURED A SMALL SLOOP BELONGING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND BROKE IT UP IN ORDER TO GET THE MATERIAL HE NEEDED TO MAKE HIS OWN VESSEL SEAWORTHY
WE TURN OUR FACES HOMEWARD
WHOM HE HAD NEVER FORGIVEN FOR THE SHAMEFUL AND TREACHEROUS MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD TREATED HIM WAS STILL ON SHORE ENJOYING HIMSELF BUT HE WAS TOLD BY THE CAPTAIN OF A SMALL TRADING VESSEL THAT THE OLD PIRATE WAS PREPARING FOR ANOTHER CRUISE
TOOK OATHS AND DID EVERYTHING THAT WAS NECESSARY TO CHANGE HIMSELF FROM A PIRATE CAPTAIN TO A RESPECTABLE COMMANDER
A BLUEBIRD'S NOTES BLEND WITH THOSE OF THE SONG SPARROW AND A ROBIN SWINGING ON THE TOPMOST BRANCH OF A EUCALYPTUS AFTER A FEW SHORT NOTES
BUT TAKE IT HOME LET IT DRY IN THE SUN THEN PLACE IT ON YOUR OPEN GRATE FIRE AND AS YOU WATCH THE IRIDESCENT BLAZE CURL UP THE CHIMNEY DREAM DREAMS AND WEAVE STRANGE FANCIES
TO GUIDE THE STATELY SHIPS BETWEEN THE PORTALS OF THE GOLDEN GATE DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE WHITE BUILDINGS OF POINT BONITA
VERY DESIROUS OF BREAKING UP PIRACY ISSUED A PROCLAMATION IN WHICH HE PROMISED PARDON TO ANY PIRATE WHO WOULD APPEAR BEFORE THE PROPER AUTHORITIES RENOUNCE HIS EVIL PRACTICES AND TAKE AN OATH OF ALLEGIANCE
THROUGH A WEALTH OF TANGLED GRASSES PAST A GROVE OF LIVE OAKS FROM WHOSE TWISTED AND CONTORTED LIMBS THE GRAY MOSS HANGS IN LONG FESTOONS BY INDIAN PAINTBRUSH
AGAINST WARLIKE INTRUDERS TWO HARDY FISHERMEN HAVE VENTURED OUT AT LOW TIDE TO A LARGE ROCK AND ARE CASTING THEIR LINES INTO THE BOILING WATERS FOR ROCK COD OR PORGIES
WOULD CERTAINLY CLASS THE OCCUPANT AS A BENEFACTOR THE DEW WAS SPARKLING ON THE GRASS WHEN I SET OUT IN THE EARLY MORNING GOSSAMER SPIDER WEBS STRUNG FROM LEAF AND STEM
STAND OUT AGAINST THE GREEN OF THE HILLS STRONGLY FORTIFIED AND READY AT ALL TIMES
THEN A FLIGHT OF ARROWS CAME FROM THE BUSHES AND ALTHOUGH THEY WERE BLUNT AND COULD DO HIM NO HARM THEY RATTLED ALL OVER HIS BODY AND ONE HIT HIS NOSE AND ANOTHER HIS CHIN WHILE SEVERAL STUCK FAST IN THE LOAVES OF BREAD ALTOGETHER THE BAKER MAN WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED
I HAVE NEVER LIKED CATS SAID MISSUS GARDNER REMOTELY I LOVE THEM SAID DOROTHY THEY ARE SO NICE AND SELFISH DOGS ARE TOO GOOD AND UNSELFISH THEY MAKE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE BUT CATS ARE GLORIOUSLY HUMAN
AN IMPLEMENT EMPLOYED BY MEN OF ACQUISITIVE NATURES WHO CANNOT AFFORD SEATS IN THE STOCK EXCHANGE JOB AN UNCERTAIN COMMODITY REGULATED BY A UNION CARD JOCKEY
THE OLD WOMAN WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED WHEN SHE HEARD OF THIS NEW ADDITION TO HER FAMILY BUT SHE DID NOT GIVE WAY TO DESPAIR SHE SENT FOR THE CARPENTER AGAIN AND HAD HIM BUILD ANOTHER ADDITION TO HER HOUSE AS THE PICTURE SHOWS
AND ANY ONE WHO HASN'T CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT IT IS SO THERE IS NO NEED OF DEFINING IT THE BUSY DAYS FLEW BY AND EXAMINATIONS WERE OVER ANNE TOOK HIGH HONORS IN ENGLISH PRISCILLA TOOK HONORS IN CLASSICS AND PHIL IN MATHEMATICS
SOLUS ALONE ALONE IN THE COLD AFTER DINNER SIT A WHILE AFTER SUPPER WALK A MILE AND EVERY MEAL'S A SUPPER TO THE HOBO J
THERE'S NOTHING FOR YOU ANNE EXCEPT A CIRCULAR NOBODY NOTICED ANNE'S FLUSH AS SHE TOOK THE THIN LETTER PHIL TOSSED HER CARELESSLY BUT A FEW MINUTES LATER PHIL LOOKED UP TO SEE A TRANSFIGURED ANNE HONEY WHAT GOOD THING HAS HAPPENED
I SPENT IT USEFULLY FOR CLOTHES AND HATED THEM EVERY TIME I PUT THEM ON THINK OF HAVING A REAL LIVE AUTHOR AT PATTY'S PLACE SAID PRISCILLA
HOW THANKFUL LITTLE PHIL WILL BE WHEN ALL THIS EXAMINATING IS OVER EXAMINATING I NEVER HEARD SUCH A WORD WELL HAVEN'T I AS GOOD A RIGHT TO MAKE A WORD AS ANY ONE ELSE DEMANDED PHIL WORDS AREN'T MADE THEY GROW
THIS CAKE IS NOW WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A FLAT FAILURE AND THE CUSHION IS LIKEWISE RUINED NEVER TELL ME THAT FRIDAY ISN'T UNLUCKY PEOPLE WHO SEND WORD THEY ARE COMING ON SATURDAY SHOULDN'T COME ON FRIDAY SAID AUNT JAMESINA
OR DOROTHY'S ARDENT IMPULSIVE GOOD WISHES IT WAS OF ONE STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE PANG THAT SPOILED THIS LONG EXPECTED DAY FOR HER AND LEFT IN IT A CERTAIN FAINT BUT ENDURING FLAVOR OF BITTERNESS
SAID ANNE TRYING HARD TO SPEAK AS IF SHE WERE ACCUSTOMED TO HAVING SKETCHES ACCEPTED EVERY MAIL BUT NOT QUITE SUCCEEDING
TO CON OR JOSH JOLLY BOAT THE SHIP OF STATE JUDGE ONE WHO SITS ON A BENCH IN A COURT FRAMES SENTENCES AND FINISHES CROOKS FOR A LIVING AND SWEARS CONTINUALLY
AND WHEN ALL THE SIXTEEN SMALL INDIANS RUSHED FROM THE BUSHES AND FLOURISHED THEIR TOMAHAWKS HE TOOK TO HIS HEELS AND RAN DOWN THE HILL AS FAST AS HE COULD GO WHEN THE GRANDMOTHER RETURNED SHE ASKED WHERE IS THE BREAD FOR YOUR SUPPER
A WARM PLUMMY ODOR FILLED THE WHOLE HOUSE FOR PRISCILLA WAS COOKING IN THE KITCHEN PRESENTLY SHE CAME IN ENSHROUDED IN A HUGE WORK APRON WITH A SMUDGE OF FLOUR ON HER NOSE
NOT THEIR FAULT POOR SOULS BUT THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOME GUMPTION SHOULD DULY THANK THE LORD FOR IT WILL YOU PLEASE DEFINE WHAT GUMPTION IS AUNT JIMSIE ASKED PHIL NO I WON'T YOUNG WOMAN ANY ONE WHO HAS GUMPTION KNOWS WHAT IT IS
ANNE SCRAMBLED TO HER FEET SOMEHOW EMPTYING TWO INDIGNANT CATS OUT OF HER LAP AS SHE DID SO AND MECHANICALLY SHIFTING HER WISHBONE FROM HER RIGHT HAND TO HER LEFT PRISCILLA WHO WOULD HAVE HAD TO CROSS THE ROOM TO REACH THE KITCHEN DOOR LOST HER HEAD
AND SOON PEOPLE CAME FROM ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY TO LOOK AT THE QUEER HOUSE AND THEY USUALLY WENT AWAY LAUGHING THE OLD WOMAN DID NOT MIND THIS AT ALL SHE WAS TOO BUSY TO BE ANGRY
BUT WOULD IT NOT BE SOMETHING OF AN ORDEAL GOSSIP HAD FILTERED TO ANNE REGARDING THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE GARDNERS VIEWED THE INFATUATION OF SON AND BROTHER ROY MUST HAVE BROUGHT PRESSURE TO BEAR IN THE MATTER OF THIS CALL ANNE KNEW SHE WOULD BE WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE
BUT IT WAS A GOOD AND WHOLESOME DIET AND THE CHILDREN THRIVED AND GREW FAT UPON IT ONE DAY A STRANGER CAME ALONG THE ROAD AND WHEN HE SAW THE OLD WOMAN'S HOUSE HE BEGAN TO LAUGH WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT SIR
COULD QUITE SUBDUE THE SPARKLE OF HER STARRY HOPES NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS NOT SO RAPT FROM THINGS OF EARTH AS TO BE UNABLE TO NOTICE THAT CHRISTINE'S WALK WAS DECIDEDLY UNGRACEFUL BUT I SUPPOSE GILBERT LOOKS ONLY AT HER FACE
YOU DON'T ACT AS IF YOU WERE BY TIMES SAID AUNT JAMESINA SEVERELY OH AUNT JIMSIE HAVEN'T WE BEEN PRETTY GOOD GIRLS TAKE US BY AND LARGE THESE THREE WINTERS YOU'VE MOTHERED US PLEADED PHIL
THE ARTS GRADUATES GAVE A GRADUATION DANCE THAT NIGHT WHEN ANNE DRESSED FOR IT SHE TOSSED ASIDE THE PEARL BEADS SHE USUALLY WORE AND TOOK FROM HER TRUNK THE SMALL BOX THAT HAD COME TO GREEN GABLES ON CHRISTMAS DAY IN IT WAS A THREAD LIKE GOLD CHAIN
FROM THE BUTCHER OR A LOW QUARTER IN TOWN IN EITHER CASE THE LOWER THE TOUGHER JOKE A FORM OF HUMOR ENJOYED BY SOME AND MISUNDERSTOOD BY MOST IN ENGLAND REQUIRING A DIAGRAM
OF TOLERANT WONDER ANNE DESPITE HER AFFECTION FOR RUSTY WAS NOT ESPECIALLY FOND OF CATS BUT MISSUS GARDNER'S TONE ANNOYED HER INCONSEQUENTLY SHE REMEMBERED THAT MISSUS JOHN BLYTHE WAS SO FOND OF CATS THAT SHE KEPT AS MANY AS HER HUSBAND WOULD ALLOW
THE YOUNGSTERS WERE LIKE ALL OTHER CHILDREN AND GOT INTO MISCHIEF ONCE IN AWHILE BUT THE OLD WOMAN HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH CHILDREN AND MANAGED TO KEEP THEM IN ORDER VERY WELL WHILE THEY QUICKLY LEARNED TO OBEY HER AND GENERALLY DID AS THEY WERE BID
PRISCILLA CAME DOWN APRONLESS AND SMUDGELESS STELLA REDUCED HER CORNER TO DECENCY AND PHIL SAVED THE SITUATION BY A STREAM OF READY SMALL TALK MISSUS GARDNER WAS TALL AND THIN AND HANDSOME EXQUISITELY GOWNED CORDIAL WITH A CORDIALITY THAT SEEMED
GOD BE GOOD TO ME CRIED THE OLD LADY EMBRACING HIM IT IS MY INNOCENT BOY MY DEAR OLD NURSE CRIED OLIVER HE WOULD COME BACK I KNEW HE WOULD SAID THE OLD LADY HOLDING HIM IN HER ARMS HOW WELL HE LOOKS
IF IT BE PAINFUL TO HIM SHE THOUGHT TO COME BACK HERE HOW PAINFUL IT WILL BE TO ME BUT PERHAPS HE WILL NOT COME HE MAY WRITE OR HE MAY COME HIMSELF AND STUDIOUSLY ABSTAIN FROM MEETING ME HE DID WHEN HE WENT AWAY
HAS ALWAYS BEEN HER CHARACTERISTIC WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT I LEAVE YOU TO DISCOVER REPLIED MISSUS MAYLIE I MUST GO BACK TO HER GOD BLESS YOU I SHALL SEE YOU AGAIN TO NIGHT SAID THE YOUNG MAN EAGERLY
AND THE PROSPECT IT COMMANDED WAS VERY EXTENSIVE ONE BEAUTIFUL EVENING WHEN THE FIRST SHADES OF TWILIGHT WERE BEGINNING TO SETTLE UPON THE EARTH OLIVER SAT AT THIS WINDOW INTENT UPON HIS BOOKS HE HAD BEEN PORING OVER THEM FOR SOME TIME
AND SOME SLIGHT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THEIR KINDNESS TO OLIVER NOT EXACTLY THAT REJOINED MISTER BROWNLOW LAUGHING BUT WE MUST PROCEED GENTLY AND WITH GREAT CARE GENTLENESS AND CARE EXCLAIMED THE DOCTOR
WHETHER YOU THINK IT REASONABLE THAT THIS PROMISE TO THE GIRL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BINDING A PROMISE MADE WITH THE BEST AND KINDEST INTENTIONS BUT REALLY DO NOT DISCUSS THE POINT MY DEAR YOUNG LADY PRAY SAID MISTER BROWNLOW INTERRUPTING ROSE AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK
OLIVER NEEDED NO PROMPTING TO DESPATCH AND IN LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY TO CRAVEN STREET WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE ROSE LEFT OLIVER IN THE COACH UNDER PRETENCE OF PREPARING THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO RECEIVE HIM
I SHALL SURPRISE YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID ROSE NATURALLY EMBARRASSED BUT YOU ONCE SHOWED GREAT BENEVOLENCE AND GOODNESS TO A VERY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND OF MINE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL TAKE AN INTEREST IN HEARING OF HIM AGAIN
GRIMWIG WILL YOU LEAVE US FOR A FEW MINUTES I BELIEVE INTERPOSED MISS MAYLIE THAT AT THIS PERIOD OF OUR INTERVIEW I NEED NOT GIVE THAT GENTLEMAN THE TROUBLE OF GOING AWAY IF I AM CORRECTLY INFORMED
EVEN IF SHE HAD KNOWN HOW TO DO SO IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE THOUGHT OF FOR THE SAME REASON ONCE THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HER OF SEEKING ASSISTANCE FROM HARRY BUT THIS AWAKENED THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR LAST PARTING AND IT SEEMED UNWORTHY OF HER TO CALL HIM BACK WHEN
THIS IS GREAT HAPPINESS TO ME GREAT HAPPINESS BUT YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ME WHERE HE IS NOW MISS MAYLIE YOU MUST PARDON MY FINDING FAULT WITH YOU
THE MELANCHOLY WHICH HAD SEEMED TO THE SAD EYES OF THE ANXIOUS BOY TO HANG FOR DAYS PAST OVER EVERY OBJECT BEAUTIFUL AS ALL WERE WAS DISPELLED BY MAGIC THE DEW SEEMED TO SPARKLE MORE BRIGHTLY ON THE GREEN LEAVES THE AIR TO RUSTLE AMONG THEM WITH A SWEETER MUSIC
WHICH WAS QUITE AS CONSOLATORY AND FULL OF PROMISE AS OLIVER'S STATEMENT HAD ENCOURAGED HIM TO HOPE AND TO THE WHOLE OF WHICH MISTER GILES WHO AFFECTED TO BE BUSY ABOUT THE LUGGAGE LISTENED WITH GREEDY EARS
THE TEARS ROSE TO HER EYES AS SHE PURSUED THIS TRAIN OF REFLECTION HE MIGHT HAVE BY THIS TIME LEARNT TO FORGET HER AND TO BE HAPPIER AWAY DISTURBED BY THESE DIFFERENT REFLECTIONS INCLINING NOW TO ONE COURSE AND THEN TO ANOTHER
WILL HAVE BEGUN TO THINK BY THIS TIME THAT WE HAVE WEARIED OF HIS COMPANY AND ENTERED INTO SOME DARK CONSPIRACY TO THRUST HIM FORTH UPON THE WORLD
OR HOW COULD SHE POSTPONE THE JOURNEY WITHOUT EXCITING SUSPICION MISTER LOSBERNE WAS WITH THEM AND WOULD BE FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS BUT ROSE WAS TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE EXCELLENT GENTLEMAN'S IMPETUOSITY AND FORESAW TOO CLEARLY THE WRATH WITH WHICH
AND IF YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO PRODUCE ANY EVIDENCE WHICH WILL ALTER THE UNFAVOURABLE OPINION I WAS ONCE INDUCED TO ENTERTAIN OF THAT POOR CHILD IN HEAVEN'S NAME PUT ME IN POSSESSION OF IT A BAD ONE I'LL EAT MY HEAD IF HE IS NOT A BAD ONE
TO CALL IN THE AID OF MY FRIEND GRIMWIG HE IS A STRANGE CREATURE BUT A SHREWD ONE AND MIGHT PROVE OF MATERIAL ASSISTANCE TO US I SHOULD SAY THAT HE WAS BRED A LAWYER AND QUITTED THE BAR IN DISGUST BECAUSE HE HAD ONLY ONE BRIEF AND A MOTION OF COURSE
WHICH OCCASIONED HIM NO LITTLE SURPRISE AND PERPLEXITY ROSE ALSO EXPLAINED HER REASONS FOR NOT CONFIDING IN HER FRIEND MISTER LOSBERNE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE OLD GENTLEMAN CONSIDERED THAT SHE HAD ACTED PRUDENTLY
SAID MISTER BROWNLOW RATHER TESTILY WELL THAT I DO SIR REPLIED THE OLD LADY PEOPLE'S EYES AT MY TIME OF LIFE DON'T IMPROVE WITH AGE SIR I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT REJOINED MISTER BROWNLOW
A BURST OF TEARS CAME TO HIS RELIEF AND HE SEEMED TO AWAKEN ALL AT ONCE TO A FULL SENSE OF THE JOYFUL CHANGE THAT HAD OCCURRED AND THE ALMOST INSUPPORTABLE LOAD OF ANGUISH WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIS BREAST THE NIGHT WAS FAST CLOSING IN WHEN HE RETURNED HOMEWARD
HE IS WAITING IN A COACH AT THE DOOR REPLIED ROSE AT THIS DOOR CRIED THE OLD GENTLEMAN WITH WHICH HE HURRIED OUT OF THE ROOM DOWN THE STAIRS UP THE COACHSTEPS AND INTO THE COACH WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD
IN THE FIRST EXPLOSION OF HIS INDIGNATION HE WOULD REGARD THE INSTRUMENT OF OLIVER'S RECAPTURE TO TRUST HIM WITH THE SECRET WHEN HER REPRESENTATIONS IN THE GIRL'S BEHALF COULD BE SECONDED BY NO EXPERIENCED PERSON
THEY PURPOSED REMAINING IN LONDON ONLY THREE DAYS PRIOR TO DEPARTING FOR SOME WEEKS TO A DISTANT PART OF THE COAST IT WAS NOW MIDNIGHT OF THE FIRST DAY WHAT COURSE OF ACTION COULD SHE DETERMINE UPON WHICH COULD BE ADOPTED IN EIGHT AND FORTY HOURS
AND HE'D UNCOMMONLY LIKE TO SEE ANY MAN OFFER TO DO IT RESPONDED MISTER GRIMWIG KNOCKING HIS STICK UPON THE FLOOR HAVING GONE THUS FAR THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN SEVERALLY TOOK SNUFF
RUNNING UP TO THE CHAISE DOOR GILES POPPED OUT HIS NIGHTCAP AGAIN PREPARATORY TO MAKING SOME REPLY WHEN HE WAS SUDDENLY PULLED BACK BY A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO OCCUPIED THE OTHER CORNER OF THE CHAISE AND WHO EAGERLY DEMANDED WHAT WAS THE NEWS
I HAVE NO THOUGHT NO VIEW NO HOPE IN LIFE BEYOND HER AND IF YOU OPPOSE ME IN THIS GREAT STAKE YOU TAKE MY PEACE AND HAPPINESS IN YOUR HANDS AND CAST THEM TO THE WIND MOTHER THINK BETTER OF THIS AND OF ME
WHICH THE AMERICAN LANGUAGE IS CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING IT WAS A SCENE OF INDESCRIBABLE CONFUSION AND UPROAR THEY SHOUTED THEY CLAPPED THEY STAMPED ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALL ALL THE WEAPONS IN THE MUSEUM DISCHARGED AT ONCE
DURING THE WAR OF THE REBELLION A NEW AND INFLUENTIAL CLUB WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE CITY OF BALTIMORE IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND IT IS WELL KNOWN WITH WHAT ENERGY THE TASTE FOR MILITARY MATTERS BECAME DEVELOPED
GUNS WERE COMPELLED TO BOW BEFORE THEIR TRANSATLANTIC RIVALS NOW WHEN AN AMERICAN HAS AN IDEA HE DIRECTLY SEEKS A SECOND AMERICAN TO SHARE IT
AUDACITY AND SANG FROID AT THIS MOMENT HE WAS SITTING IN HIS ARMCHAIR SILENT ABSORBED LOST IN REFLECTION SHELTERED UNDER HIS HIGH CROWNED HAT A KIND OF BLACK CYLINDER WHICH ALWAYS SEEMS FIRMLY SCREWED UPON THE HEAD OF AN AMERICAN
NO TRUE YANKEE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED EVEN THE SEMBLANCE OF A DIFFICULTY TO BE POSSIBLE A THING WITH THEM IS NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE THE TRIUMPHAL PROGRESS OF THE PRESIDENT CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE EVENING IT WAS A REGULAR TORCHLIGHT PROCESSION
OR MORE OR LESS PERFECTED A CANNON OR IN DEFAULT OF A CANNON AT LEAST A FIREARM OF SOME DESCRIPTION IT MAY HOWEVER BE MENTIONED THAT MERE INVENTORS OF REVOLVERS FIRE SHOOTING
ALL THE PAPERS PAMPHLETS REPORTS ALL THE JOURNALS PUBLISHED BY THE SCIENTIFIC LITERARY AND RELIGIOUS SOCIETIES ENLARGED UPON ITS ADVANTAGES AND THE SOCIETY OF NATURAL HISTORY OF BOSTON THE SOCIETY OF SCIENCE AND ART OF ALBANY
OF ITS TIME ABOUT EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE A SMALL TREATISE TRANSLATED FROM THE NEW YORK AMERICAN RELATED HOW SIR JOHN HERSCHEL HAVING BEEN DESPATCHED TO THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING THERE SOME ASTRONOMICAL CALCULATIONS
BARBICANE HAD MADE A LARGE FORTUNE AS A TIMBER MERCHANT BEING NOMINATED DIRECTOR OF ARTILLERY DURING THE WAR
TOGETHER WITH GRIEF AND THE GUN CLUB WAS RELEGATED TO PROFOUND INACTIVITY SOME FEW OF THE MORE ADVANCED AND INVETERATE THEORISTS SET THEMSELVES AGAIN TO WORK UPON CALCULATIONS REGARDING THE LAWS OF PROJECTILES THEY REVERTED INVARIABLY
COULD NOT HAVE MORE VIOLENTLY SET IN MOTION THE WAVES OF SOUND ONE NEED NOT BE SURPRISED AT THIS THERE ARE SOME CANNONEERS NEARLY AS NOISY AS THEIR OWN GUNS BARBICANE REMAINED CALM IN THE MIDST OF THIS ENTHUSIASTIC CLAMOR
EVERY ONE MUST SEE THAT THAT INVOLVED THE COMMENCEMENT OF A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS ALL MUST HOPE THAT SOME DAY AMERICA
FROM THAT DAY FORWARD IMPEY BARBICANE BECAME ONE OF THE GREATEST CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES A KIND OF WASHINGTON OF SCIENCE A SINGLE TRAIT OF FEELING TAKEN FROM MANY OTHERS WILL SERVE TO SHOW THE POINT WHICH THIS HOMAGE OF A WHOLE PEOPLE
WHICH MET WITH SUCH SUCCESS IN FRANCE SOMEWHAT LATER ANOTHER FRENCHMAN NAMED FONTENELLE WROTE THE PLURALITY OF WORLDS A
SAID BARBICANE THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I CALL PURELY PAPER ONES
NO DIRECT COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH HER A VIOLENT MOVEMENT OF INTEREST AND SURPRISE HERE GREETED THIS REMARK OF THE SPEAKER PERMIT ME HE CONTINUED TO RECOUNT TO YOU BRIEFLY HOW CERTAIN ARDENT SPIRITS STARTING ON IMAGINARY JOURNEYS

AND SIMILAR SMALL ARMS MET WITH LITTLE CONSIDERATION
NEVERTHELESS I AM BOUND TO ADD THAT SOME PRACTICAL GENIUSES HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ESTABLISH ACTUAL COMMUNICATION WITH HER THUS A FEW DAYS AGO A GERMAN GEOMETRICIAN PROPOSED TO SEND A SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION TO THE STEPPES OF SIBERIA
SEEING IN THAT TITLE AN ALLUSION DAMAGING TO BARBICANE'S PROJECT BROKE INTO THE AUDITORIUM SMASHED THE BENCHES AND COMPELLED THE UNLUCKY DIRECTOR TO ALTER HIS PLAYBILL
AFTER A PERIOD OF YEARS FULL OF INCIDENTS WE HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO ABANDON OUR LABORS AND TO STOP SHORT ON THE ROAD OF PROGRESS I DO NOT HESITATE TO STATE BALDLY THAT ANY WAR WHICH WOULD RECALL US TO ARMS WOULD BE WELCOME TREMENDOUS APPLAUSE
ONE MIGHT SAY ALL THE WORLD WAS ON THE RAMPARTS THE PRESIDENT WAS SUFFICIENTLY WELL KNOWN HOWEVER FOR ALL TO BE ASSURED THAT HE WOULD NOT PUT HIS COLLEAGUES TO DISCOMFORT WITHOUT SOME VERY STRONG MOTIVE IMPEY BARBICANE WAS A MAN OF FORTY YEARS OF AGE
ANTECEDENTS OF THE GUN CLUB AND IT CANNOT FAIL TO MAKE SOME NOISE IN THE WORLD A THRILL OF EXCITEMENT RAN THROUGH THE MEETING BARBICANE HAVING BY A RAPID MOVEMENT FIRMLY FIXED HIS HAT UPON HIS HEAD CALMLY CONTINUED HIS HARANGUE
CYRANO DE BERGERAC PUBLISHED THAT CELEBRATED
OF THESE LITTLE FACTS AND FELT JUSTLY PROUD WHEN THE DESPATCHES OF A BATTLE RETURNED THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS AT TEN FOLD THE QUANTITY OF PROJECTILES EXPENDED ONE DAY HOWEVER SAD AND MELANCHOLY DAY PEACE WAS SIGNED BETWEEN THE SURVIVORS OF THE WAR
THEY DEBATED WHETHER THE MOON WAS A FINISHED WORLD OR WHETHER IT WAS DESTINED TO UNDERGO ANY FURTHER TRANSFORMATION DID IT RESEMBLE THE EARTH AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE LATTER WAS DESTITUTE AS YET OF AN ATMOSPHERE WHAT KIND OF SPECTACLE WOULD ITS HIDDEN HEMISPHERE PRESENT TO OUR TERRESTRIAL SPHEROID
RIDICULOUS REPLIED TOM HUNTER WHITTLING WITH HIS BOWIE KNIFE THE ARMS OF HIS EASY CHAIR BUT IF THAT BE THE CASE THERE ALL THAT IS LEFT FOR US IS TO PLANT TOBACCO AND DISTILL WHALE OIL WHAT ROARED J T MASTON
IT IS TOO TRUE REPLIED J T MASTON WITH FRESH VIOLENCE THERE ARE A THOUSAND GROUNDS FOR FIGHTING AND YET WE DON'T FIGHT WE SAVE UP OUR ARMS AND LEGS FOR THE BENEFIT OF NATIONS
THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND STATISTICAL SOCIETY OF NEW YORK THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY OF PHILADELPHIA AND THE SMITHSONIAN OF WASHINGTON SENT INNUMERABLE LETTERS OF CONGRATULATION TO THE GUN CLUB TOGETHER WITH OFFERS OF IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE AND MONEY
WITH ALL HIS NUMBERLESS PARTS DOUBLE MUSCLES THE POPULAR FAVOUR AND THE SO PRECIOUS ESTEEM OF BRAVE COMMANDANT BRAVIDA EX CAPTAIN IN THE ARMY CLOTHING FACTORY TARTARIN WAS NOT HAPPY
BUT YET HE WAS EVEN THEN THE COCK OF THE WALK AT TARASCON LET US SHOW WHENCE AROSE THIS SOVEREIGNTY IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU MUST KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IS SHOOTING MAD IN THESE PARTS
IN THE SILENCE AND OBSCURITY OF HIS STUDY HE EXERCISED HIMSELF FOR A WHILE WARDING OFF IMAGINARY CUTS AND THRUSTS LUNGING AT THE WALL AND GIVING HIS MUSCLES PLAY THEN HE TOOK HIS MASTER KEY
AND JUST AS SOON AS THAT PULSE BEGAN TO JUMP AND YELL FOR SOMETHING FROM MY FIERY PEN HE WOULD THROW THE SILLY SYCLOPEDIA AT IT THEN
THE GRIZZLY OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS WHO WOBBLES ON HIS HIND LEGS AND LICKS HIMSELF WITH A TONGUE FULL OF BLOOD
THE SIGHT OF ALL THE MURDEROUS IMPLEMENTS KEPT HIM IN A PERPETUAL STEW OF WRATH AND EXALTATION HIS REVOLVERS REPEATING RIFLES AND DUCKING GUNS SHOUTED BATTLE BATTLE
BUT ALACK BY REASON OF SOME NASTY MEANNESS OF DESTINY
ALONG THE WATERSIDE
AND LOOK'D AS IF A LITTLE GOOD FORTUNE MIGHT MAKE US GOOD FRIENDS BUT YOUR SPECIAL FRIEND MY ELDER BROTHER I HAVE A STORY TO TELL YOU OF HIM WILL MY COUSIN F COME THINK YOU
AND CRANKINESS FOR THE GRANDIOSE AND ROMANTIC BUT WORSE IS THE LUCK HE HAD NOT THE BODY OF THE CELEBRATED HIDALGO THAT THIN AND MEAGRE APOLOGY FOR A BODY ON WHICH MATERIAL LIFE FAILED TO TAKE A HOLD
VIOLENTLY AND ABRUPTLY SO THAT IT SHOULD SLAM AGAINST THE OUTER WALL IF THEY HAD BEEN SKULKING BEHIND IT YOU MAY WAGER THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN JAM
WAS A STOUT HONEST BULLY OF A BODY VERY FAT VERY WEIGHTY MOST SENSUAL AND FOND OF CODDLING HIGHLY TOUCHY FULL OF LOW CLASS APPETITE AND HOMELY REQUIREMENTS
AND BAD DREAMS A LIQUID SUBSTANCE WHICH WHEN APPLIED TO A HOLDOVER REVIVIFIES IT AND ENABLES ITS OWNER TO SIT UP AND NOTICE THE BAR TENDER ABSTAIN

AND NOTHING BY WOMEN FOR MEN HAVE EVER A LIK'ROUS APPETITE ON LOWER THINGS TO PERFORM THEIR DELIGHT THAN ON THEIR WIVES BE THEY NEVER SO FAIR
SO THAT THE WOLF NE MADE IT NOT MISCARRY HE WAS A SHEPHERD AND NO MERCENARY
AS HE THAT WISE WAS AND OBEDIENT TO KEEP HIS FORWORD BY HIS FREE ASSENT HE SAID
NOW I CANNOT TELL HOW IT CAME ABOUT WHETHER SHE PRETENDED TO BE DROWNING OR WHETHER HE FRIGHTENED HER OR CAUGHT HER SO AS TO EMBARRASS HER BUT CERTAINLY HE BROUGHT HER TO SHORE IN A FASHION IGNOMINIOUS TO A SWIMMER
FOR HER ANGER MADE HER MORE CHARMING THAN ANY ONE ELSE HAD EVER BEHELD HER AND AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE WHICH CERTAINLY WAS NOT FAR SHE HAD NOT A SINGLE FAULT ABOUT HER EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT SHE HAD NOT ANY GRAVITY
THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU THE PRINCE WENT TO DRESS FOR THE OCCASION FOR HE WAS RESOLVED TO DIE LIKE A PRINCE WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THAT A MAN HAD OFFERED TO DIE FOR HER
WITH KAIMAK ENRICHED WITH THE CANDIED PEEL OF CITRONS WITH ORANGES LEMONS PINE APPLES PISTACHIO NUTS AND MOCHA COFFEE UNADULTERATED WITH THE BAD COFFEE OF BATAVIA OR THE AMERICAN ISLANDS
NOW FOR YOUR OWN SAKE PRINCESS SAID HE I CANNOT LET YOU GO TO SLEEP YOU MUST SIT AND LOOK AT ME ELSE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WELL I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN TO OBLIGE YOU
AT LENGTH HE ENTERED ANOTHER WOOD NOT A WILD FOREST BUT A CIVILIZED WOOD THROUGH WHICH A FOOTPATH LED HIM TO THE SIDE OF A LAKE ALONG THIS PATH THE PRINCE PURSUED HIS WAY THROUGH THE GATHERING DARKNESS
TILL SHE GOT TO THE LANDING STAIRS OF THE PALACE BY THIS TIME HER PEOPLE WERE ON THE SHORE FOR THEY HAD HEARD HER SHRIEK SHE MADE THEM CARRY THE PRINCE TO HER OWN ROOM AND LAY HIM IN HER BED AND LIGHT A FIRE AND SEND FOR THE DOCTORS
AND NOW THIS NEW ADVENTURE SET THEM PHILOSOPHISING MORE THAN EVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE LIVED A VERY FAMOUS DERVISH WHO WAS ESTEEMED THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN ALL TURKEY AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT HIM PANGLOSS WAS THE SPEAKER
LOVE AND WATER BROUGHT BACK ALL HER STRENGTH SHE GOT UNDER THE WATER AND PULLED AND PULLED WITH HER WHOLE MIGHT TILL AT LAST SHE GOT ONE LEG OUT THE OTHER EASILY FOLLOWED HOW SHE GOT HIM INTO THE BOAT SHE NEVER COULD TELL
GRANDEUR SAID PANGLOSS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF PHILOSOPHERS FOR IN SHORT EGLON KING OF MOAB WAS ASSASSINATED BY EHUD ABSALOM WAS HUNG BY HIS HAIR AND PIERCED WITH THREE DARTS
FEELING VERY FAINT INDEED ONLY I SHALL DIE BEFORE IT IS OF ANY USE TO YOU UNLESS I HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT THERE THEN SAID SHE HOLDING OUT THE WINE TO HIM AH YOU MUST FEED ME I DARE NOT MOVE MY HANDS
AND MORE NEARLY DROWNED THAN SHE HAD EVER EXPECTED TO BE FOR THE WATER HAD GOT INTO HER THROAT AS OFTEN AS SHE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK AT THE PLACE TO WHICH HE BORE HER THE BANK WAS ONLY A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE WATER
AND YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT ME ONCE DID HE THEN I SUPPOSE I MUST BUT I AM SO SLEEPY SLEEP THEN DARLING AND DON'T MIND ME SAID THE POOR PRINCE
YES I WILL ANSWERED THE PRINCESS AND KISSED HIM WITH A LONG SWEET COLD KISS NOW SAID HE WITH A SIGH OF CONTENT I DIE HAPPY
HAVING BESIDES BROUGHT SO MANY DIAMONDS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE ANCIENT INCAS MUST HAVE LED A VERY HAPPY LIFE BUT HE WAS SO MUCH IMPOSED UPON BY THE JEWS THAT HE HAD NOTHING LEFT EXCEPT HIS SMALL FARM
DON'T YOU LIKE FALLING IN THEN SAID THE PRINCE IT IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL FUN I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE ANSWERED SHE I NEVER FELL BEFORE I WISH I COULD LEARN
FOR HE MADE A GOOD JOINER AND BECAME A VERY HONEST MAN
THERE IS A CONCATENATION OF EVENTS IN THIS BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS
HE TURNED ALMOST EXPECTING TO SEE HER STILL BY HIS SIDE BUT HE WAS ALONE IN THE WATER SO HE SWAM AWAY QUIETLY AND WATCHED THE LIGHTS ROVING ABOUT THE SHORE FOR HOURS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS SAFE IN HER CHAMBER
THERE IS HORRIBLE EVIL IN THIS WORLD WHAT SIGNIFIES IT SAID THE DERVISH WHETHER THERE BE EVIL OR GOOD WHEN HIS HIGHNESS SENDS A SHIP TO EGYPT DOES HE TROUBLE HIS HEAD WHETHER THE MICE ON BOARD ARE AT THEIR EASE OR NOT
IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN PUT INTO THE INQUISITION IF YOU HAD NOT WALKED OVER AMERICA IF YOU HAD NOT STABBED THE BARON IF YOU HAD NOT LOST ALL YOUR SHEEP FROM THE FINE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE EATING PRESERVED CITRONS AND PISTACHIO NUTS
HA SAID PANGLOSS TO PAQUETTE PROVIDENCE HAS THEN BROUGHT YOU AMONGST US AGAIN MY POOR CHILD DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU COST ME THE TIP OF MY NOSE AN EYE AND AN EAR AS YOU MAY SEE WHAT A WORLD IS THIS
LET US WORK SAID MARTIN WITHOUT DISPUTING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO RENDER LIFE TOLERABLE THE WHOLE LITTLE SOCIETY ENTERED INTO THIS LAUDABLE DESIGN ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT ABILITIES THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
IT IS NATURAL TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER SO MANY DISASTERS CANDIDE MARRIED AND LIVING WITH THE PHILOSOPHER PANGLOSS THE PHILOSOPHER MARTIN THE PRUDENT CACAMBO AND THE OLD WOMAN
WHERE THEY HAD ALREADY PLACED A LITTLE BOAT FOR HER THE WATER WAS NOT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT IT BUT THEY HOPED IT WOULD BE BEFORE LONG THEY LAID HER ON CUSHIONS PLACED IN THE BOAT WINES AND FRUITS AND OTHER NICE THINGS AND STRETCHED A CANOPY OVER ALL
WHAT THEN MUST WE DO SAID PANGLOSS HOLD YOUR TONGUE ANSWERED THE DERVISH I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL
OR IN SHORT THE POWER OF MAKING IMPRESSIONS UPON THE RADICAL SENSORIUM SO THAT HE SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER SHE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE OF COURSE HE MADE NO FURTHER INQUIRIES ABOUT HER
I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER BUT I DON'T CARE AT ALL EVENTS AS WE HAVE FALLEN IN LET US HAVE A SWIM TOGETHER WITH ALL MY HEART RESPONDED THE PRINCE
NOT NOW WAS THE CAUSE AN IMPERTINENCE IN TALL BLACK LETTERS IT WAS INSTEAD A SHINING BEACON IN LETTERS OF FLAME GUIDING STRAIGHT TO VICTORY
THEY STARTED ON THE RETURN JOURNEY TO THEIR OWN LANDS THE JED OF LESSER HELIUM WITH A SMALL PARTY OF NOBLES ACCOMPANIED THEM ALL THE WAY TO THARK TO CEMENT MORE CLOSELY THE NEW BONDS OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP
PACING BACK AND FORTH WITH TENSE DRAWN FACE WHEN ALL WERE IN THEIR SEATS HE TURNED TOWARD US THIS MORNING HE SAID
WHICH WAS WITHHOLDING THE SPARK OF LIFE FROM THE INHABITANTS OF AN ENTIRE PLANET BESIDE THE DOOR A GREAT CREW OF MEN HAD BEEN LABORING TO PIERCE THE WALL BUT THEY HAD SCARCELY SCRATCHED THE FLINT LIKE SURFACE
MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE THOROUGHLY APPROVES OF THE MATCH AND THINKS ITS LIKELY MISS LAVENDAR WILL GIVE UP HER QUEER NOTIONS AND BE LIKE OTHER PEOPLE NOW THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE MARRIED
I KNEW I COULD TRUST FATHER TO PICK ME OUT A NICE LITTLE SECOND MOTHER HE SAID PROUDLY IT'S A FINE THING TO HAVE A FATHER YOU CAN DEPEND ON TEACHER I JUST LOVE MISS LAVENDAR GRANDMA IS PLEASED TOO SHE SAYS SHE'S REAL GLAD FATHER DIDN'T PICK OUT AN AMERICAN FOR HIS SECOND WIFE BECAUSE
AS IF HE WANTED KATE'S OPINION ON THAT OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT CONCERNED HIM AND BILLY ONCE TORN BY JEALOUSY AND EXASPERATED AT THE FREQUENT INTERRUPTIONS OF THEIR QUIET HOURS TOGETHER HE HAD COMPLAINED OPENLY ACTUALLY BILLY IT'S WORSE THAN MARIE'S WEDDING HE DECLARED
HE STOOPED AND KISSED THE WOMEN OF HIS FAMILY AND LAID HIS STRONG HAND UPON THE SHOULDERS OF THE MEN AS I TURNED SADLY FROM HIM MY EYES FELL UPON DEJAH THORIS HER HEAD WAS DROOPING UPON HER BREAST TO ALL APPEARANCES SHE WAS LIFELESS
ONCE THAT THERE WOULD BE A ROMANCE THERE THEY WERE THE BEST OF FRIENDS AND THEY WERE WELL SUITED TO EACH OTHER IN TASTES AND TEMPERAMENT I THINK INDEED THAT THE ROMANCE WAS WELL UNDER WAY THOUGH THERE WAS NEVER AN ENGAGEMENT WHEN MISSUS GREGGORY PAUSED AND WET HER LIPS
BUT EVEN SO IT'S NICE TO THINK ONE WAS AN INSTRUMENT USED BY PREDESTINATION YES INDEED IT'S VERY ROMANTIC I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S SO TERRIBLY ROMANTIC AT ALL SAID MARILLA RATHER CRISPLY
I AM GLAD DIANA IS SO HAPPY AND SATISFIED BUT WHEN MY TURN COMES IF IT EVER DOES I DO HOPE THERE'LL BE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE THRILLING ABOUT IT BUT THEN DIANA THOUGHT SO TOO ONCE
MUSIC MUSIC THE SPECTRE THAT FROM THE FIRST HAD DOGGED HIS FOOTSTEPS WITH BILLY'S BEHAVIOR TOWARD HIMSELF BERTRAM COULD FIND NO FAULT SHE WAS ALWAYS HER SWEET LOYAL LOVABLE SELF EAGER TO HEAR OF HIS WORK
I DO NOT NEED TO TELL YOU WHAT THIS MEANS TO BARSOOM IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS TO PENETRATE THOSE MIGHTY WALLS IN FACT THE WORK HAS ALREADY COMMENCED AND THERE WOULD BE LITTLE TO FEAR WERE THE ENGINE OF THE PUMPING PLANT TO RUN AS IT SHOULD
THAT BILLY'S BREATH DROPPED INTO A FLUTTERING SIGH AND HER CAUSE BECAME SUDDENLY IMPERTINENCE SPELLED IN BLACK CAPITALS THEN MISSUS GREGGORY SPOKE SLOWLY A LITTLE SADLY I DON'T MIND SAYING TO YOU THAT I DID HOPE
EARNESTLY SOLICITOUS THAT IT SHOULD BE A SUCCESS SHE EVEN AS HE SOMETIMES HALF IRRITABLY REMEMBERED HAD ONCE TOLD HIM THAT SHE REALIZED HE BELONGED TO ART BEFORE HE DID TO HIMSELF AND WHEN HE HAD INDIGNANTLY DENIED THIS SHE HAD ONLY LAUGHED AND THROWN A KISS AT HIM
MISTER ARKWRIGHT AND MISS GREGGORY BUT THEN THAT OF COURSE DID NOT SIGNIFY BILLY DECLARED TO HERSELF I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T EVER CALL HIM MARY JANE SHE SAID TO THE GIRL A LITTLE MISCHIEVOUSLY ONE DAY MARY JANE MISTER ARKWRIGHT NO I DON'T
SHE WAS AND NEVER ASKED ANYBODY ANYTHING ABOUT HER AND NOW EVERYTHING HAS COME RIGHT AND I HAD A HAND IN BRINGING IT ABOUT PERHAPS AS MISSUS LYNDE SAYS
REJOINED MISS GREGGORY WITH AN ODD SMILE THEN AFTER A MOMENT SHE ADDED I BELIEVE HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS USED TO HOWEVER YES I KNOW LAUGHED BILLY WE THOUGHT HE WAS A REAL MARY JANE ONCE AND SHE TOLD THE STORY OF HIS ARRIVAL
PROMISED ANNE SOLEMNLY OF COURSE IT WON'T BE FOR EVER SO LONG YET SAID DIANA BLUSHING THREE YEARS AT THE VERY LEAST FOR I'M ONLY EIGHTEEN AND MOTHER SAYS NO DAUGHTER OF HERS SHALL BE MARRIED BEFORE SHE'S TWENTY ONE
RETURNED UPON A BATTLESHIP THAT HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO THARK TO FETCH THEM IN TIME FOR THE CEREMONY WHICH MADE DEJAH
CHAPTER TWENTY THREE THE CAUSE AND BERTRAM FEBRUARY CAME THE OPERETTA FOR WHICH BILLY WAS WORKING SO HARD WAS TO BE GIVEN THE TWENTIETH THE ART EXHIBITION FOR WHICH BERTRAM WAS PREPARING HIS FOUR PICTURES WAS TO OPEN THE SIXTEENTH
WAITING HAPPILY FOR THE SUMMER TO BRING LIFE AND LAUGHTER BACK TO IT AGAIN THERE WAS MORE ROMANCE IN THE WORLD THAN THAT WHICH HAD FALLEN TO THE SHARE OF THE MIDDLE AGED LOVERS OF THE STONE HOUSE
BERTRAM HENSHAW IN THE STRATA WAS AS IT HAPPENED NOT FALLING ASLEEP HE WAS LYING BROADLY AND UNHAPPILY AWAKE BERTRAM VERY FREQUENTLY LAY BROADLY AND UNHAPPILY AWAKE THESE DAYS OR RATHER NIGHTS HE TOLD HIMSELF ON THESE OCCASIONS
THEIR RUNNING ACROSS EACH OTHER LIKE THIS MISSUS GREGGORY SHE MURMURED AND THERE WAS A ROMANCE WASN'T THERE I HAVE JUST FELT IN MY BONES THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE BILLY HELD HER BREATH IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD MEANT TO SAY BUT NOW THAT SHE HAD SAID IT THE WORDS SEEMED
MARILLA GLANCED AT THE RADIANT YOUNG FACE AND REFRAINED FROM FURTHER SARCASTIC COMMENTS PERHAPS SOME REALIZATION CAME TO HER THAT AFTER ALL IT WAS BETTER TO HAVE LIKE ANNE THE VISION AND THE FACULTY DIVINE THAT GIFT
HELPING HER ARRANGE PICTURES LAY OUT GARDENS AND ACCOMPLISH SUNDRY OTHER TASKS WHICH A PROUD AND MELANCHOLY HERO EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED BENEATH HIS DIGNITY ANNE TRIED TO
THAT THIS CAN'T HELP MAKING SOME DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIANA AND ME I'M SURE I CAN'T TELL HER ALL MY SECRETS AFTER THIS SHE MIGHT TELL FRED AND
NOW IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THEM HOW THEY SHOULD DIE LET US GO ABOUT OUR DUTIES AS THOUGH A THOUSAND USEFUL YEARS STILL LAY BEFORE US THE CHAMBER RANG WITH APPLAUSE
AND HASTEN THE ASSISTANT KEEPER TO THE PLANT ALL DAY A THOUSAND CRUISERS HAVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR HIM UNTIL JUST NOW ONE OF THEM RETURNS BEARING HIS DEAD BODY WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE PITS BENEATH HIS HOUSE HORRIBLY MUTILATED BY SOME ASSASSIN
BUT AS THEY WERE NOT LEARNED MEN THEY COULD ONLY WALK ABOUT AND STARE ENJOY THE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF NATURAL HISTORY THEY POSSESSED AND WISH WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS THEY HAD ACQUIRED MORE EVEN THE SKELETON OF THE MOUSE PUZZLED JACOB WHAT WONDER
CONTAINING PROFESSOR LUZAC'S MEMORIAL AND BOERHAAVE'S MONUMENT OF WHITE AND BLACK MARBLE WITH ITS URN AND CARVED SYMBOLS OF THE FOUR AGES OF LIFE AND ITS MEDALLION OF BOERHAAVE ADORNED WITH HIS FAVORITE MOTTO
AND SLOW AS I BEGAN TO TRAVEL I STILL KEPT ASKING MY WAY AND STILL KEPT ADVANCING
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE PLAINNESS OF MY APPEARANCE IN MY COUNTRY HABIT AND THAT ALL DUSTY FROM THE ROAD CONSORTED ILL WITH THE GREATNESS OF THE PLACE TO WHICH I WAS BOUND BUT AFTER TWO OR MAYBE THREE HAD GIVEN ME THE SAME LOOK AND THE SAME ANSWER
LEYDEN THE BOYS MET AT THE MUSEUM AND WERE SOON ENGAGED IN EXAMINING ITS EXTENSIVE COLLECTION OF CURIOSITIES RECEIVING A NEW INSIGHT INTO
OTHERS CROUCH BEFORE THE PUBLIC EDIFICES AND CHURCHES BEING CLEAN SPACIOUS WELL SHADED AND ADORNED WITH MANY ELEGANT MANSIONS
THE BETTER TO SET THIS FEAR AT REST I CHANGED THE FORM OF MY INQUIRIES AND SPYING AN HONEST FELLOW COMING ALONG A LANE ON THE SHAFT OF HIS CART I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD EVER HEARD TELL OF A HOUSE THEY CALLED THE HOUSE OF SHAWS
YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ON THOUSANDS YOU FOOLS AND YOU HANG A LEG YOU'D BE AS RICH AS KINGS IF YOU COULD FIND IT AND YOU KNOW IT'S HERE AND YOU STAND THERE SKULKING THERE WASN'T ONE OF YOU DARED FACE BILL
THEY MUST BE CLOSE BY THEY CAN'T BE FAR YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ON IT SCATTER AND LOOK FOR THEM DOGS OH SHIVER MY SOUL HE CRIED
YE CAN PUT IT DOWN UPON THE DOORSTEP AND BE OFF WITH YE I WILL DO NO SUCH THING I CRIED I WILL DELIVER IT INTO MISTER BALFOUR'S HANDS AS IT WAS MEANT I SHOULD IT IS A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION A WHAT
THAT IS THE HOUSE OF SHAWS SHE CRIED BLOOD BUILT IT BLOOD STOPPED THE BUILDING OF IT BLOOD SHALL BRING IT DOWN SEE HERE SHE CRIED AGAIN I SPIT UPON THE GROUND AND CRACK MY THUMB AT IT BLACK BE ITS FALL
AND HE WENT ON TO HIS NEXT CUSTOMER NO WISER THAN HE CAME I CANNOT WELL DESCRIBE THE BLOW THIS DEALT TO MY ILLUSIONS THE MORE INDISTINCT THE ACCUSATIONS WERE THE LESS I LIKED THEM FOR THEY LEFT THE WIDER FIELD TO FANCY
KNEW NO BETTER THAN TO BE VENTURESOME WHY LET HIM TUMBLE HORROR WHAT MEAN THAT HEAVY CRASHING SOUND BEN COULD NOT STIR HE COULD ONLY GASP JACOB JACOB CRIED ANOTHER STARTLED VOICE
SAID BEN AFTER LAMBERT HAD BEEN POINTING OUT SOME OF THE ODDITIES AND BEAUTIES OF THE SUBURBS IT IS ALL WINDMILLS YOU REMEMBER HIS TERRIFIC CONTEST WITH ONE I SUPPOSE NO SAID LAMBERT BLUNTLY
THE NEXT PERSON I CAME ACROSS WAS A DAPPER LITTLE MAN IN A BEAUTIFUL WHITE WIG WHOM I SAW TO BE A BARBER ON HIS ROUNDS AND KNOWING WELL THAT BARBERS WERE GREAT GOSSIPS I ASKED HIM PLAINLY WHAT SORT OF A MAN WAS MISTER BALFOUR OF THE SHAWS
MY CURIOSITY IN A SENSE WAS STRONGER THAN MY FEAR FOR I COULD NOT REMAIN WHERE I WAS BUT CREPT BACK TO THE BANK AGAIN WHENCE SHELTERING MY HEAD BEHIND A BUSH OF BROOM I MIGHT COMMAND THE ROAD BEFORE OUR DOOR
WELL I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT WAS THERE WAS A BIG STONE LYING ON THE WALL AND I PUT MY MY FOOT OUT JUST TO PUSH IT A LITTLE YOU SEE AND THE FIRST THING I KNEW
BUT HE'S DEAD YOU SEE AND PEOPLE WILL MAKE IT OUT AGAINST AN OFFICER OF HIS MAJESTY'S REVENUE IF MAKE IT OUT THEY CAN NOW I'LL TELL YOU HAWKINS IF YOU LIKE I'LL TAKE YOU ALONG I THANKED HIM HEARTILY FOR THE OFFER
WHAT DO YOU SEE AND FOR MONTHS HE COULD ONLY ANSWER NO HELP I SEE AROUND US NOTHING BUT THE ENEMY BEN PUSHED THESE THOUGHTS AWAY AND RESOLUTELY LOOKING DOWN INTO THE BARE TEA GARDEN
I WAS SO MUCH SURPRISED AT THIS THAT I COULD FIND NO VOICE TO ANSWER BUT STOOD STARING AY THE MAN RESUMED HE'LL BE DEAD NO DOUBT AND THAT'LL BE WHAT BRINGS YE CHAPPING TO MY DOOR
HOOT HOOT HOOT SAID THE BARBER NAE KIND OF A MAN NAE KIND OF A MAN AT ALL AND BEGAN TO ASK ME VERY SHREWDLY WHAT MY BUSINESS WAS BUT I WAS MORE THAN A MATCH FOR HIM AT THAT
AND BY OTHERS TO HAVE BEEN THE CASTLE OF ONE OF THE ANCIENT COUNTS OF HOLLAND AS THE BOYS WALKED ABOUT ON THE TOP OF ITS STONE WALL THEY COULD GET BUT A POOR VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING CITY
FINALLY HE TOOK A WRONG TURN AND RAN A FEW STEPS PAST ME TOWARDS THE HAMLET CRYING
AND CATS IBEXES AND OTHER CREATURES THEY SAW A MASSIVE GOLD ARMLET THAT HAD BEEN WORN BY AN EGYPTIAN KING AT A TIME WHEN SOME OF THESE SAME MUMMIES PERHAPS WERE NIMBLY TREADING THE STREETS OF THEBES
IN THE MEANTIME THE SUPERVISOR RODE ON AS FAST AS HE COULD TO KITT'S HOLE BUT HIS MEN HAD TO DISMOUNT AND GROPE DOWN THE DINGLE LEADING AND SOMETIMES SUPPORTING THEIR HORSES AND IN CONTINUAL FEAR OF AMBUSHES
HE CRIED WE DON'T SEE IT HERE NOHOW RETURNED THE MAN HERE YOU BELOW THERE IS IT ON BILL CRIED THE BLIND MAN AGAIN
FILLED IT IN IMAGINATION WITH GAY SUMMER GROUPS HE TRIED TO FORGET OLD BATTLE CLOUDS AND PICTURE ONLY CURLING WREATHS OF TOBACCO SMOKE RISING FROM AMONG MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN ENJOYING THEIR TEA AND COFFEE IN THE OPEN AIR

HIS FATHER WAS SILENT FOR HE SAW THAT DIAMOND WAS RIGHT AND
CHAPTER NINETEEN DIAMOND'S FRIENDS ONE DAY WHEN OLD DIAMOND WAS STANDING WITH HIS NOSE IN HIS BAG BETWEEN PALL MALL AND COCKSPUR STREET

HIS FATHER LAUGHED AGAIN WHY CHILD YOU'RE JUST COUNTING EVERYBODY YOU KNOW THAT DON'T MAKE EM FRIENDS DON'T IT I THOUGHT IT DID WELL BUT
HE SANG THIS WOOD IS ALL MY OWN APPLES AND CHERRIES ROSES AND HONEY SO HERE I'LL SIT LIKE A KING ON MY THRONE
AND EVERY CREATURE LOW DOWN BELOW HE CALLED AND THE CREATURES OBEYED THE CALL TOOK THEIR LEGS AND THEIR WINGS AND FOLLOWED HIM ALL SQUIRRELS THAT CARRIED THEIR TAILS LIKE A SACK
BUT HAD ALWAYS FAILED TO FIND ONE MORE LIKE IT THAN ANOTHER SO HE WISELY GAVE UP THE SEARCH TILL HE COULD REALLY READ THEN HE RESOLVED TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING AND READ THEM ALL STRAIGHT THROUGH
BUT HE HAD NEVER COME UPON THE POEM HE THOUGHT HE HAD HEARD HIS MOTHER READ FROM IT THAT DAY HE HAD LOOKED THROUGH AND THROUGH THE BOOK SEVERAL TIMES AFTER HE KNEW THE LETTERS AND A FEW WORDS FANCYING HE COULD TELL THE LOOK OF IT
LEAPED FROM ITS BED AND AFTER HIM TOOK
SAID THE GIRL LOOKING UP CONFIDENTLY IN HIS FACE IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME YOU CAN COME AND TAKE A LOOK AT HER THE WORDS SOUNDED RUDE BUT THE GIRL'S FACE LOOKED SO SIMPLE THAT THE GENTLEMAN SAW SHE DID NOT MEAN TO BE RUDE
THE SPIDER FORGOT AND FOLLOWED HIM SPINNING AND LOST ALL HIS THREAD FROM END TO BEGINNING THE GAY WASP FORGOT HIS RINGS AND HIS WAIST HE NEVER HAD MADE SUCH UNDIGNIFIED HASTE
THEN LITTLE BOY BLUE BEGAN TO PONDER WHAT'S TO BE DONE WITH THEM ALL I WONDER THEN LITTLE BOY BLUE HE SAID QUITE LOW WHAT TO DO WITH YOU ALL I AM SURE I DON'T KNOW
AND THE BOUGHS BOW DOWN AND THE APPLES THEY DAPPLE THE GRASS TOO MANY FOR HIM TO GRAPPLE AND THE CHEERIEST CHERRIES WITH NEVER A MISS FALL TO HIS MOUTH EACH A FULL GROWN KISS
PARADISE ROW SHE ANSWERED
HE INSISTED SHOULDN'T I EVERYBODY CALLS HER WICKED OLD GRANNIE
HE WAS PLEASED TO FIND IT SO CLEAN FOR THE STREETS WERE MUDDY AND HE HAD NICE BOOTS ON
FOR HIS LESSON BOOK THOSE VERY RHYMES HIS MOTHER HAD PICKED UP ON THE SEA SHORE AND AS DIAMOND WAS NOT BEGINNING TOO SOON HE LEARNED VERY FAST INDEED WITHIN A MONTH HE WAS ABLE TO SPELL OUT MOST OF THE VERSES FOR HIMSELF
DRIVE A CAB SAID DIAMOND GOOD AND WHAT ELSE HE CONTINUED FOR
SAID THE BROOK RUNNING FASTER I RUN THROUGH HIS GARDEN SAID THE MOLE TWO HUNDRED WORMS THERE I CAUGHT EM LAST YEAR AND I'M GOING AGAIN NEXT AUTUMN SAID THEY ALL IF THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT US TO STEER FOR
AND HIS MASTER WAS READING THE NEWSPAPER ON THE BOX OF HIS CAB WHICH WAS THE LAST OF A GOOD MANY IN THE ROW LITTLE DIAMOND GOT DOWN FOR A RUN FOR HIS LEGS WERE GETTING CRAMPED WITH SITTING
HIS FATHER LAUGHED MUCH GOOD THEY'LL DO YOU HE SAID
MISSUS CRUMP AND THEN THERE'S THE CLERGYMAN THAT SPOKE TO ME IN THE GARDEN THAT DAY THE TREE WAS BLOWN DOWN WHAT'S HIS NAME I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME WHERE DOES HE LIVE I DON'T KNOW
COUCHED IN THE SAME LANGUAGE AS HIS WIFE'S AND SEATED HIMSELF IN ONE OF THE BROCADE ARMCHAIRS WITH THE SIMPLICITY OF A REIGNING SOVEREIGN I HAD JUST FINISHED READING THE TIMES HE SAID
THE TICK OF THE MONUMENTAL ORMOLU CLOCK ON THE WHITE MARBLE MANTELPIECE GREW AS LOUD AS THE BOOM OF A MINUTE GUN ARCHER CONTEMPLATED WITH AWE
OVERWHELMED BY WHAT IT SUDDENLY TOLD HIM YOU TOO OH ALL THIS TIME YOU TOO
AND THAT EVENING AT THE OPERA MISTER SILLERTON JACKSON WAS ABLE TO STATE THAT
OF COURSE YOU KNOW ALREADY ABOUT MAY AND ME HE SAID
INVITING THE COUNTESS OLENSKA TO THE DINNER WHICH THE VAN DER LUYDENS WERE GIVING THE FOLLOWING WEEK FOR THEIR COUSIN THE DUKE OF SAINT AUSTREY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEN IN THE CLUB BOX EXCHANGED A SMILE AT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT
WHICH RECALLED SCENES IN FRENCH FICTION AND ARCHITECTURAL INCENTIVES TO IMMORALITY SUCH AS THE SIMPLE AMERICAN HAD NEVER DREAMED OF THAT WAS HOW WOMEN WITH LOVERS LIVED IN THE WICKED OLD SOCIETIES
AND MINE A PART OF YOURS SHE NODDED AND THAT'S TO BE ALL FOR EITHER OF US WELL IT IS ALL ISN'T IT
SHE TALKED TO HIM OF THE YEAR AND A HALF SINCE THEY HAD MET SHE HAD GROWN TIRED OF WHAT PEOPLE CALLED SOCIETY NEW YORK WAS KIND IT WAS ALMOST OPPRESSIVELY HOSPITABLE
AS STATELY AS HER OWN PERHAPS FOR SHE WAS AN IMPARTIAL WOMAN EVEN STATELIER AND THAT THE COBBLE STONES OVER WHICH THE OLD CLATTERING OMNIBUSES BUMPED WOULD BE REPLACED BY SMOOTH ASPHALT
FLUTTERED OVER MISSUS VAN DER LUYDEN'S FACE SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GUESSED AND APPROVED MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN TURNED TO MISSUS ARCHER IF LOUISA'S HEALTH ALLOWED HER TO DINE OUT
OLD FASHIONED EYES I HOPE YOU DON'T MEAN MINE MY DEAR I LIKE ALL THE NOVELTIES SAID THE ANCESTRESS LIFTING THE STONE TO HER SMALL BRIGHT ORBS WHICH NO GLASSES HAD EVER DISFIGURED
THOSE WERE OF THE PUREST EIGHTEEN THIRTY WITH A GRIM HARMONY OF CABBAGE ROSE GARLANDED CARPETS ROSEWOOD CONSOLES ROUND ARCHED FIRE PLACES
BUT THIS PASSION THAT WAS CLOSER THAN HIS BONES WAS NOT TO BE SUPERFICIALLY SATISFIED HIS ONE TERROR WAS TO DO ANYTHING WHICH MIGHT EFFACE THE SOUND AND IMPRESSION OF HER WORDS HIS ONE THOUGHT
SUCH AS PEOPLE REPORTED HAVING SEEN IN PARIS MEANWHILE AS EVERY ONE SHE CARED TO SEE CAME TO HER AND SHE COULD FILL HER ROOMS AS EASILY AS THE BEAUFORTS AND WITHOUT ADDING A
SINGLE ITEM TO THE MENU OF HER SUPPERS SHE DID NOT SUFFER FROM HER GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION THE IMMENSE ACCRETION OF FLESH WHICH HAD DESCENDED ON HER IN MIDDLE LIFE LIKE A FLOOD OF LAVA ON A DOOMED CITY
HE TURNED TOWARD THE YOUNG MAN HAVE YOU READ THIS MORNING'S TIMES NEWLAND WHY YES SIR SAID ARCHER WHO USUALLY TOSSED OFF HALF A DOZEN PAPERS WITH HIS MORNING COFFEE
I'M CERTAIN OF IT SIR LARRY HAS BEEN GOING IT RATHER HARDER THAN USUAL LATELY IF COUSIN LOUISA WON'T MIND MY MENTIONING IT
UPHOLSTERED LIKE A SOFA AND A TOILET TABLE WITH FRIVOLOUS LACE FLOUNCES AND A GILT FRAMED MIRROR HER VISITORS WERE STARTLED AND FASCINATED BY THE FOREIGNNESS OF THIS ARRANGEMENT
AS IF WATCHING CALMLY FOR LIFE AND FASHION TO FLOW NORTHWARD TO HER SOLITARY DOORS SHE SEEMED IN NO HURRY TO HAVE THEM COME FOR HER PATIENCE WAS EQUALLED BY HER CONFIDENCE SHE WAS SURE THAT
AND IMMENSE GLAZED BOOK CASES OF MAHOGANY WHEREAS OLD MISSUS MINGOTT WHO HAD BUILT HER HOUSE LATER HAD BODILY CAST OUT THE MASSIVE FURNITURE OF HER PRIME AND MINGLED WITH THE MINGOTT HEIRLOOMS
AT THAT HE SPRANG UP FORGETTING EVERYTHING BUT THE SWEETNESS OF HER FACE SHE ROSE TOO NOT AS IF TO MEET HIM OR TO FLEE FROM HIM BUT QUIETLY
TO PICTURE HER BLAMELESS LIFE LED IN THE STAGE SETTING OF ADULTERY BUT HE SAID TO HIMSELF WITH CONSIDERABLE ADMIRATION THAT IF A LOVER HAD BEEN WHAT SHE WANTED THE INTREPID WOMAN WOULD HAVE HAD HIM TOO
PRESENTLY THE HOARDINGS THE QUARRIES THE ONE STORY SALOONS THE WOODEN GREEN HOUSES IN RAGGED GARDENS AND THE ROCKS FROM WHICH GOATS SURVEYED THE SCENE
BUT BEING SHY AND RETIRING PERSONS WITH NO NATURAL INCLINATION FOR THEIR PART THEY LIVED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN THE SYLVAN SOLITUDE OF SKUYTERCLIFF AND WHEN THEY CAME TO TOWN DECLINED ALL INVITATIONS
OH MISSUS WELLAND MURMURED WHILE THE YOUNG MAN SMILING AT HIS BETROTHED REPLIED AS SOON AS EVER IT CAN IF ONLY YOU'LL BACK ME UP MISSUS MINGOTT WE MUST GIVE THEM TIME TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER A LITTLE BETTER MAMMA
THE FRIVOLOUS UPHOLSTERY OF THE SECOND EMPIRE
AND PROCEEDED TO REHEARSE ONCE MORE THE MONSTROUS TALE OF THE AFFRONT INFLICTED ON MISSUS LOVELL MINGOTT OF COURSE SHE ENDED AUGUSTA WELLAND AND MARY MINGOTT BOTH FELT THAT
BUT NOW WE LIVE IN A CONSTANT RUSH SAID MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN IN MEASURED TONES LOOKING WITH PLEASANT DELIBERATION ABOUT THE LARGE SHROUDED ROOM WHICH TO ARCHER WAS SO COMPLETE AN IMAGE OF ITS OWNERS
NED LAND YELPED DID I SAY SHARKS I EXCLAIMED HASTILY I MEANT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEARLS SHARKS WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE INDEED CONSEIL SAID
THAT PEARL DANGLING FROM THE LOWER LOBE OF THE INDIAN PENINSULA I WENT LOOKING IN THE LIBRARY FOR A BOOK ABOUT THIS ISLAND ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE IN THE WORLD SURE ENOUGH I FOUND A VOLUME ENTITLED CEYLON AND THE SINGHALESE
WELL HOW ABOUT YOU CONSEIL WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT THESE MAN EATERS ME CONSEIL SAID I'M AFRAID I MUST BE FRANK WITH MASTER GOOD FOR YOU I THOUGHT
MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED LAUGHING THOSE WERE ARTIFICIAL PEARLS ORDINARY GLASS BEADS WHOSE INSIDES WERE COATED WITH ESSENCE OF ORIENT WOW
I EVEN BOUGHT A PEARL NECKLACE FOR MY FIANCEE KATE TENDER BUT SHE MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE INSTEAD
ALTHOUGH THESE FISHERIES BELONG TO THE MOST INDUSTRIALIZED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE ENGLISH
AND THERE I WAS FANTASIZING ABOUT SHARKS ENVISIONING HUGE JAWS ARMED WITH MULTIPLE ROWS OF TEETH AND CAPABLE OF CUTTING A MAN IN HALF I COULD ALREADY FEEL A DEFINITE PAIN AROUND MY PELVIC GIRDLE
LINING THE INSIDES OF THEIR VALVES ARE MUSSELS INCLUDED TOO THE CANADIAN ASKED YES THE MUSSELS OF CERTAIN STREAMS IN SCOTLAND WALES IRELAND SAXONY BOHEMIA AND FRANCE
OPENING THE BELLY RIPPING OUT THE HEART AND TOSSING IT INTO THE SEA SO IT'S AN ISSUE OF YES PRECISELY IN THE WATER IN THE WATER YE GODS JUST GIVE ME A GOOD HARPOON
I FOUND IT BY THE NINTH PARALLEL OFF THE NORTHWESTERN SHORES OF CEYLON
BRIGHT AND EARLY THIS SAID IN A CAREFREE TONE CAPTAIN NEMO LEFT THE LOUNGE IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT BEARS IN THE SWISS MOUNTAINS YOU MIGHT SAY OH GOOD I GET TO GO BEAR HUNTING TOMORROW
BY THE WAY GALLANT NED ARE YOU AFRAID OF SHARKS
HAVEN'T CERTAIN FAMOUS PEARLS BEEN QUOTED AT EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES YES MY BOY
GOOD THE CANADIAN REPLIED FROM NOW ON WE'LL PAY CLOSER ATTENTION TO EM BUT I WENT ON FOR SECRETING PEARLS THE IDEAL MOLLUSK IS THE PEARL OYSTER MELEAGRINA MARGARITIFERA
CONSEIL SAID TO ME GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND ON PEARL FISHING ON THE FISHING ITSELF I ASKED OR ON THE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS THAT ON THE FISHING THE CANADIAN REPLIED BEFORE WE TACKLE THE TERRAIN IT HELPS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH IT
ALL RIGHT SIT DOWN MY FRIENDS
THE CANADIAN SAID BUT SAID CONSEIL WHO PERPETUALLY RETURNED TO THE DIDACTIC SIDE OF THINGS IS THIS PEARL FISHING EVER DANGEROUS NO I REPLIED QUICKLY ESPECIALLY IF ONE TAKES CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS
I KNOW THAT SOME DIVERS CAN LAST UP TO FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS AND HIGHLY SKILLFUL ONES TO EIGHTY SEVEN BUT SUCH MEN ARE RARE
THESE CEYLON FISHERIES ARE FARMED ANNUALLY FOR A TOTAL PROFIT OF THREE MILLION MAN EATERS FRANCS CONSEIL REBUKED YES FRANCS THREE MILLION FRANCS I WENT ON
FOR MY PART I STARED AT THEM WITH ANXIOUS EYES AS IF THEY WERE ALREADY MISSING A LIMB OR TWO SHOULD I ALERT THEM YES SURELY BUT I HARDLY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT WOULD MASTER
CONSEIL PUT IN AND WHY NOT WHAT GOOD WOULD A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS DO US HERE ON THE NAUTILUS HERE NO NED LAND SAID BUT ELSEWHERE OH ELSEWHERE CONSEIL PUT IN
THE ENGLISHMAN PERCIVAL MADE MUCH OF A KAFFIR WHO STAYED UNDER FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT COMING UP TO THE SURFACE BUT I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE
WHY YES CERTAINLY OF COURSE I CAN SEE THAT YOU LIKE THE IDEA MISTER LAND YES IT WILL BE A REALLY UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS I ADDED IN AN INSINUATING TONE
ONLY DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH AND FOR THIRTY DAYS SOME THREE HUNDRED BOATS CONCENTRATE ON THE LUCRATIVE HARVEST OF THESE TREASURES FROM THE SEA EACH BOAT IS MANNED BY TEN OARSMEN AND TEN FISHERMEN THE LATTER DIVIDE INTO TWO GROUPS
AND FINALLY FOR NATURALISTS IT'S A SIMPLE FESTERING SECRETION FROM THE ORGAN THAT PRODUCES MOTHER OF PEARL IN CERTAIN BIVALVES BRANCH MOLLUSCA CONSEIL SAID CLASS
BUT NOW THEY BRING IN ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THAT AMOUNT ALL IN ALL IT'S ESTIMATED THAT NINE MILLION FRANCS IS THE CURRENT YEARLY RETURN FOR THE WHOLE PEARL HARVESTING INDUSTRY BUT CONSEIL ASKED
HOW INGENIOUS CONSEIL SAID TO REDUCE DIVIDING AND CLASSIFYING PEARLS TO A MECHANICAL OPERATION AND COULD MASTER TELL US THE PROFITS BROUGHT IN BY HARVESTING THESE BANKS OF PEARL OYSTERS ACCORDING TO SIRR'S BOOK I REPLIED
THE CANADIAN SAID NO MY FRIEND THAT TASK IS PERFORMED WITH ELEVEN STRAINERS OR SIEVES THAT ARE PIERCED WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF HOLES THOSE PEARLS STAYING IN THE STRAINERS WITH TWENTY TO EIGHTY HOLES ARE IN THE FIRST ORDER
THEY EVEN MENTION ONE OYSTER ABOUT WHICH I REMAIN DUBIOUS
THIS ONE CONSEIL SAID POINTING TO A MAGNIFICENT JEWEL IN ITS GLASS CASE EXACTLY AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT FAR OFF WHEN I ESTIMATE ITS VALUE AT TWO MILLION UH FRANCS
THE PEAR SHAPED ONES INTO EARRINGS AND SINCE THEY'RE THE MOST VALUABLE THEY'RE PRICED INDIVIDUALLY THE OTHER PEARLS THAT STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL ARE MORE ERRATICALLY SHAPED AND ARE PRICED BY WEIGHT FINALLY CLASSED IN THE LOWEST ORDER
IS FAMOUS FOR ITS PEARL FISHERIES WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED PROFESSOR ARONNAX
WHO WAS AFTERWARD METROPOLITAN OF CANADA THEN THEY WANDERED DOWN THE STREET ALONG THE RIVER AND SAW THE DOUBLE HOUSE WHERE MISSUS EWING
THERE WAS A SMALL BUT WELL ARRANGED MUSEUM OF STUFFED BIRDS AND BEASTS ALL CANADIAN AND MOST OF THEM FROM NEW BRUNSWICK THERE WERE OTHER THINGS TOO TO SEE AND MANY ANECDOTES TO HEAR
CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR THE WHIP HAND SPARGO ALMOST IRRITABLE FROM DESIRE TO GET AT CLOSE GRIPS WITH THE OBJECTS OF HIS LONG JOURNEY SHOOK OFF BRETON'S HAND WITH A GROWL OF RESENTMENT
AND I THINK THAT MUST BE A GOOD OMEN MARJORIE LAUGHED AS SHE PATTED THE LITTLE BUNCH OF BLUE GRAY FUR IN DORA'S LAP JACKIE HAS MADE FRIENDS WITH YOU ALREADY SHE SAID
THE INTERIOR INTO WHICH HE LOOKED WAS ROUGH AND COMFORTLESS IN THE EXTREME THERE WERE THE BARE ACCESSORIES OF A MOORLAND COTTAGE ROUGH CHAIRS AND TABLES PLASTERED WALLS A FISHING ROD OR TWO PILED IN A CORNER SOME FOOD SET OUT ON A SIDE TABLE
SIT DOWN IN THAT CHAIR IT'S THE HEAVIEST THE PLACE AFFORDS INTO IT NOW SPARGO YOU SEE THAT COIL OF ROPE THERE TIE MYERST UP HAND AND FOOT TO THAT CHAIR AND TIE HIM WELL ALL THE KNOTS TO BE DOUBLE SPARGO AND BEHIND HIM
THAT WOULD DO FOR TO DAY WOULDN'T IT THEN DAY AFTER TO MORROW WE COULD HAVE THE PICNIC AND FOR THE NEXT WEEK I HAVE A MAGNIFICENT IDEA BUT I WANT TO TALK IT OVER WITH YOUR FATHER
SPARGO STARTED AS IF SOMETHING HAD BITTEN HIM MYERST HE ALMOST SHOUTED MYERST GOOD LORD WHY DID I NEVER THINK OF HIM MYERST THEN I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM SAID BRETON BUT
GUARDIAN CONTINUED BRETON DON'T BE FRIGHTENED AND DON'T YOU BE FRIGHTENED EITHER MISTER CARDLESTONE THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF JUST YET WHATEVER THERE MAY BE LATER ON IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MISTER SPARGO AND I CAME JUST IN TIME
AND MAKE HER THOROUGHLY AT HOME IN THE HOUSE AND GARDEN THEN THIS AFTERNOON PERHAPS YOUR FATHER WILL TAKE YOU FOR A WALK AND SHOW DORA THE HOUSE WHERE MISSUS EWING LIVED AND ANY OTHER INTERESTING PLACES
HE KEPT MYERST COVERED WHILE SPARGO MADE PLAY WITH THE ROPE DON'T BE AFRAID OF HURTING HIM SPARGO HE SAID TIE HIM WELL AND STRONG HE WON'T SHIFT THAT CHAIR IN A HURRY
YES HE MUTTERED BLACKMAIL THAT WAS IT BLACKMAIL HE HE GOT MONEY PAPERS FROM US THEY'RE ON HIM BRETON TURNED ON THE CAPTIVE WITH A LOOK OF CONTEMPT I THOUGHT AS MUCH MISTER MYERST HE SAID
THERE WAS A QUANTITY OF LOOSE GOLD A NUMBER OF BANK NOTES OF THE MORE EASILY NEGOTIATED DENOMINATIONS VARIOUS FOREIGN SECURITIES REALIZABLE IN PARIS
LET ALONE BEAUTIFULEST WHAT A DEAR BOY JACK MUST BE
AT THE TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR THE THREE MEN SAT CARDLESTONE'S FACE WAS IN THE SHADOW MYERST HAD HIS BACK TO THE WINDOW OLD ELPHICK BENDING OVER THE TABLE WAS LABORIOUSLY WRITING WITH SHAKING FINGERS
RIKA DOM WHICH MEANS RIVER HOUSE AND HAD WRITTEN IN MANY OF HER LETTERS OF THE BEAUTIFUL RIVER ON WHICH IT LOOKED AND THE GNARLED OLD WILLOWS ON THE BANK JUST IN FRONT OF HER WINDOWS THESE WILLOWS SHE HAD OFTEN SKETCHED
NOW THE DAY IS OVER WAS ENDED AND THEN A DROWSY VOICE MURMURED NOW SUSAN MY VERY FAVOURITE SONG
I'M GOING TO WRITE A NOTE TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE AT HAWES THERE'S A FARM HALF A MILE FROM HERE WHERE I CAN GET A MAN TO RIDE DOWN TO HAWES WITH THE NOTE NOW IF YOU WANT TO SEND A WIRE TO THE WATCHMAN DRAFT IT OUT AND HE'LL TAKE IT WITH HIM
THE PARTING FROM HER PARENTS HARD AND THE THOUGHT OF MEETING THE UNKNOWN RELATIVES HAD WEIGHED UPON HER MIND AND HELPED TO MAKE HER UNUSUALLY SUBDUED BUT WHEN THE DOOR OF THE BIG BRICK HOUSE
CAME IN AND CARRIED HIM OFF IN HER STALWART ARMS TO HIS LITTLE WHITE BED WHEN HIS MOTHER STOLE UP A LITTLE LATER TO GIVE HIM A FINAL GOOD NIGHT KISS SHE HEARD SUSAN SINGING AND PAUSED AT THE DOOR TO LISTEN
WE ARE GLAD TO MEET YOU SO UNEXPECTEDLY AND I MUST TROUBLE YOU TO PUT UP YOUR HANDS QUICK MYERST MADE ONE HURRIED MOVEMENT OF HIS RIGHT HAND TOWARDS HIS HIP BUT A SUDDEN GROWL FROM BRETON MADE HIM SHIFT IT JUST AS QUICKLY ABOVE HIS HEAD
WHEN DORA WAS READY SHE SAT DOWN IN THE LITTLE ARMCHAIR THAT STOOD NEAR A TABLE PILED WITH BOOKS AND LOOKED ABOUT HER CONTENTEDLY THERE WAS AN AIR OF SOLID COMFORT AND COSINESS ABOUT THIS HOUSE THAT RESTED HER
NOW IT'LL COME IN HANDY FOR ANYTHING WE KNOW MYERST MAY BE ARMED WELL SAID SPARGO COME UP TO THE COTTAGE IF THINGS TURN OUT AS I THINK THEY WILL MYERST WHEN HE'S GOT WHAT HE WANTS WILL BE OFF
MAY I TROUBLE YOU TO SEE WHAT MISTER MYERST CARRIES IN HIS POCKETS GO THROUGH THEM CAREFULLY NOT FOR PAPERS OR DOCUMENTS JUST NOW WE CAN LEAVE THAT MATTER WE'VE PLENTY OF TIME SEE IF HE'S GOT A WEAPON OF ANY SORT ON HIM SPARGO
STRAWBERRY JAM THAT TASTED ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE FRESH FRUIT ITSELF GINGER CAKE DARK AND RICH AND SPICY MILK THAT WAS ALMOST CREAM FOR THE CHILDREN AND STEAMING FRAGRANT COFFEE FOR THEIR ELDERS
THE WALLPAPER WAS LIGHTER ALMOST CREAMY BROWN WITH A DAINTY HAREBELL PATTERN AND THE CURTAINS HAD A RICH BROWN BACKGROUND WITH VARIOUS PERSIAN STRIPES
AND THEY HEARD MYERST'S VOICE THREATENING COMMANDING IN TONE NOW REMEMBER ALL I'VE SAID AND DON'T YOU FORGET I'VE THE WHIP HAND OF BOTH OF YOU THE WHIP HAND
SOMETHING LIKE MISSUS EWING'S THEY SAW TOO THE PICTURESQUE COTTAGE IN WHICH A CERTAIN QUAINT OLD LADY HAD ATTAINED TO THE RIPE AGE OF A HUNDRED AND SIX YEARS A RECORD OF WHICH FREDERICTON WAS JUSTLY PROUD
AND BLUSHING BIRDS GO DOWN TO DRINK AND SHADOWS TREMBLE SO AND NOBODY KNOWS SO STILL IT FLOWS THAT ANY BROOK IS THERE AND YET YOUR LITTLE DRAUGHT OF LIFE IS DAILY DRUNKEN THERE THEN LOOK OUT FOR THE LITTLE BROOK IN MARCH
TAKES A REASONABLE TOLL OF NATURE'S WILD ANIMALS BUT NOT FOR COMMERCIAL PROFIT AND ONLY SO LONG AS HIS HUNTING DOES NOT PROMOTE THE EXTERMINATION OF SPECIES IN VIEW OF THE DISAPPEARANCE OF WILD LIFE ALL OVER THE HABITABLE GLOBE
COME SLOWLY EDEN LIPS UNUSED TO THEE BASHFUL SIP THY JASMINES AS THE FAINTING BEE REACHING LATE HIS FLOWER ROUND HER CHAMBER HUMS
AND SO THE WALLS DON'T TELL NONE WILL A PAIR OF SPECTACLES AJAR JUST STIR AN ALMANAC'S AWARE WAS IT THE MAT WINKED
THREE ROUGE ET NOIR SOUL WILT THOU TOSS AGAIN BY JUST SUCH A HAZARD HUNDREDS HAVE LOST INDEED BUT TENS HAVE WON AN ALL
MAJOR J STEVENSON HAMILTON C M Z S WARDEN OF THE GOVERNMENT GAME RESERVES OF THE TRANSVAAL SOUTH AFRICA HAS ADOPTED THE PLATFORM AND GIVEN IT THE MOST EFFECTIVE ENDORSEMENT THAT IT HAS RECEIVED FROM ANY SINGLE INDIVIDUAL
AS HE DEFEATED DYING ON WHOSE FORBIDDEN EAR THE DISTANT STRAINS OF TRIUMPH BREAK AGONIZED AND CLEAR TWO OUR SHARE OF NIGHT TO BEAR
WHOSE FARTHEST OF DEGREE WAS THAT SHE MIGHT SOME DISTANT HEAVEN DWELL TIMIDLY WITH THEE
TOO LATE FOR STRIVING FINGERS THAT PASSED AN HOUR AGO
PURCHASE AND SALE OF TROPHIES AS THE PURCHASE OF HEADS AND HORNS ESTABLISHES A MARKET VALUE AND ENCOURAGES INDIANS AND OTHERS TO SHOOT FOR SALE
THEN A SILENCE SUFFUSES THE STORY AND A SOFTNESS THE TELLER'S EYE AND THE CHILDREN NO FURTHER QUESTION AND ONLY THE WAVES REPLY
TEN AN IDEAL HUNTING TRIP CONSISTS OF A GOOD COMRADE FINE COUNTRY AND A VERY FEW TROPHIES PER HUNTER ELEVEN IN AN IDEAL HUNTING TRIP
THE TEST IS RATHER IN A LOVE OF FOREST MOUNTAINS AND DESERT IN ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE OF THE HABITS OF ANIMALS IN THE STRENUOUS PURSUIT OF A WARY AND DANGEROUS QUARRY
AND I CHOOSE JUST A THRONE
MY SECOND RANK TOO SMALL THE FIRST CROWNED CROWING ON MY FATHER'S BREAST A HALF UNCONSCIOUS QUEEN BUT THIS TIME ADEQUATE ERECT
FOR YOU SERVED HEAVEN YOU KNOW OR SOUGHT TO I COULD NOT BECAUSE YOU SATURATED SIGHT AND I HAD NO MORE EYES FOR SORDID EXCELLENCE AS PARADISE AND WERE YOU LOST I WOULD BE
EVERY MAN WHO FINDS PLEASURE IN HUNTING OR FISHING SHOULD BE WILLING TO SPEND BOTH TIME AND MONEY IN ACTIVE WORK FOR THE PROTECTION OF FORESTS FISH AND GAME THREE
WITHIN MY REACH I COULD HAVE TOUCHED I MIGHT HAVE CHANCED THAT WAY SOFT SAUNTERED THROUGH THE VILLAGE SAUNTERED AS SOFT AWAY SO UNSUSPECTED VIOLETS WITHIN THE FIELDS LIE LOW
ANYMORE THAN OF ITS MINERAL RESOURCES AND HE SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY THE SAME GAME LAWS AS WHITE MEN SIX NO MAN CAN BE A GOOD CITIZEN AND ALSO BE A SLAUGHTERER OF GAME OR FISHES
BUT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF THESE IS VERY FEW
WHEN LANDLORDS TURN THE DRUNKEN BEE OUT OF THE FOXGLOVE'S DOOR WHEN BUTTERFLIES RENOUNCE THEIR DRAMS I SHALL BUT DRINK THE MORE TILL SERAPHS SWING THEIR SNOWY HATS AND SAINTS TO WINDOWS RUN
BUT THE REAL GENTLEMEN SPORTSMEN OF THE WORLD ARE NOT INSENSIBLE TO THE DUTIES OF THE HOUR IN REGARD TO THE TAKING OR NOT TAKING OF GAME THE TIME HAS COME WHEN CANON LAWS SHOULD BE LAID DOWN OF WORLD WIDE APPLICATION
WHILE THE OLD COUPLE JUST ASTIR FANCY THE SUNRISE LEFT THE DOOR AJAR
AND THE VALUE OF WILD GAME AS HUMAN FOOD SHOULD NO LONGER BE REGARDED AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ITS PURSUIT NINE IF RIGHTLY CONSERVED WILD GAME CONSTITUTES A VALUABLE ASSET
MINE BY THE RIGHT OF THE WHITE ELECTION MINE BY THE ROYAL SEAL MINE BY THE SIGN IN THE SCARLET PRISON BARS CANNOT CONCEAL MINE HERE IN VISION AND IN VETO MINE BY THE GRAVE'S REPEAL TITLED CONFIRMED DELIRIOUS CHARTER
A FEW CLUBS OF MEN WHO ARE HUNTERS OF BIG GAME HAD EXPRESSED IN THEIR CONSTITUTIONS A FEW BRIEF PRINCIPLES FOR THE PURPOSE OF STANDARDIZING THEIR OWN RESPECTIVE MEMBERSHIPS BUT THAT WAS ALL
UNTIL THEIR TIME BEFALLS IF ONLY CENTURIES DELAYED I'D COUNT THEM ON MY HAND
AND SO THOROUGHLY ACCEPTED AND PROMULGATED THAT THEIR BINDING FORCE CAN NOT BE IGNORED AMONG OTHER THINGS IT IS TIME FOR A LIST OF SPECIES TO BE PUBLISHED WHICH NO MAN CLAIMING TO BE EITHER A GENTLEMAN OR A SPORTSMAN
FIVE AN INDIAN HAS NO MORE RIGHT TO KILL WILD GAME
WE TRUST IN PLUMED PROCESSION FOR SUCH THE ANGELS GO RANK AFTER RANK WITH EVEN FEET AND UNIFORMS OF SNOW
THE SALE OF GAME IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE PERPETUAL PRESERVATION OF A PROPER STOCK OF GAME
CAME TO CONTINENTS OF SUMMER TO FIRMAMENTS OF SUN TO STRANGE BRIGHT CROWDS OF FLOWERS AND BIRDS OF FOREIGN TONGUE I SAY AS IF THIS LITTLE FLOWER TO EDEN WANDERED IN WHAT THEN
WITH JUST THE DOOR AJAR THAT OCEANS ARE AND PRAYER AND THAT PALE SUSTENANCE DESPAIR
ANGELS BREATHLESS BALLOT LINGERS TO RECORD THEE IMPS IN EAGER CAUCUS RAFFLE FOR MY SOUL
AS IF NO SOUL THE SOLSTICE PASSED THAT MAKETH ALL THINGS NEW THE TIME WAS SCARCE PROFANED BY SPEECH THE SYMBOL OF A WORD WAS NEEDLESS AS AT SACRAMENT THE WARDROBE OF OUR LORD
SILENCE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GRANDCOURT SAID WHAT MEN ARE INVITED HERE WITH THEIR WIVES
PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES
FOR MACBETH'S RHETORIC ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING MANY OPPOSITE THINGS IN THE SAME MOMENT REFERRED TO THE CLUMSY NECESSITIES OF ACTION AND NOT TO THE SUBTLER POSSIBILITIES OF FEELING WE CANNOT SPEAK A LOYAL WORD AND BE MEANLY SILENT
WE CANNOT KILL AND NOT KILL IN THE SAME MOMENT
THE STILL LIFE IN THE ROOM WHICH SEEMED THE STILLER FOR ITS SOBER ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE AS IF IT KEPT A CONSCIOUS WELL BRED SILENCE UNLIKE THE RESTLESSNESS OF VULGAR FURNITURE WHETHER THE GENTLEMEN WERE AGREEABLE TO EACH OTHER WAS LESS EVIDENT
WHOSE FIRMNESS SHOWED ITSELF IN NO VERY GRACEFUL OR EUPHONIOUS WAY AND WHO WERE NOT ELDEST DAUGHTERS WITH A TENDER TIMID MOTHER COMPUNCTIOUS AT HAVING SUBJECTED THEM TO INCONVENIENCES
GRANDCOURT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAD TWO REMARKABLY DIFFERENT VOICES HITHERTO WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAKING IN A SUPERFICIAL INTERRUPTED DRAWL SUGGESTIVE CHIEFLY OF LANGUOR
GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING
WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH
AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW
AND WHEN TO ALL THESE QUALIFICATIONS NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE WE ADD THE SPONTANEOUS SENSE OF CAPABILITY SOME HAPPY PERSONS ARE BORN WITH SO THAT ANY SUBJECT THEY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO IMPRESSES THEM WITH THEIR OWN POWER OF FORMING A CORRECT JUDGMENT ON IT
PERHAPS NOT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH THEM BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM HERE IT WAS LUSH WHO MADE A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN
MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
WHEN YOU ARE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN YOU WILL DISCERN NEW DUTIES SAID DERONDA MAKE IT A TASK NOW TO GET AS WELL AND CALM AS MUCH LIKE YOURSELF AS YOU CAN BEFORE HE HESITATED
AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
WHICH AS DERONDA APPROACHED HER PASSED INTO AN ANXIOUS TIMIDITY SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND BUT SAID HOW LONG AGO IT IS THEN WILL YOU SIT NEAR ME AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE
DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
HAVE YOU FALLEN IN LOVE THIS QUESTION CARRIED A STRONG SNEER I AM GOING TO MARRY HER YOU HAVE MADE HER AN OFFER ALREADY THEN NO SHE IS A YOUNG LADY WITH A WILL OF HER OWN I FANCY
GAVE A VACILLATING PREFERENCE FIRST TO ONE GENTLEMAN THEN TO THE OTHER BEING DOGS IN SUCH GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY COULD PLAY AT HUNGER AND LIKED TO BE SERVED WITH DELICACIES WHICH THEY DECLINED TO PUT IN THEIR MOUTHS ALL EXCEPT FETCH
TURN OUT THAT BRUTE WILL YOU SAID GRANDCOURT TO LUSH WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE OR LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE COUNTED ON ATTENTION TO THE SMALLEST SIGN AND LUSH IMMEDIATELY ROSE LIFTED FETCH THOUGH SHE WAS RATHER HEAVY
BUT WOULD MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THE CHANCES THAT LIFE OFFERED HER AND CONQUER CIRCUMSTANCES BY HER EXCEPTIONAL CLEVERNESS
THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
A DECISION OF WILL WHICH MADE ITSELF FELT IN HER GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS AND CLEAR UNHESITATING TONES SO THAT IF SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM ON A RAINY DAY WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS FLACCID AND THE USE OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS NOT APPARENT TO THEM
SO HE TURNED ON HIS READING LAMP AND TAKING DOWN THE KREUTZER SONATA SEARCHED IT CAREFULLY FOR THE GERMS OF BURNE'S ENTHUSIASM BEING BURNE WAS SUDDENLY SO MUCH REALLER THAN BEING CLEVER YET HE SIGHED HERE WERE OTHER POSSIBLE CLAY FEET
BUT THOUGHT THAT BURNE AND FRED WERE TWO VARSITY SPORTS SHOWING THEIR GIRL A COLLEGIATE TIME PHYLLIS'S FEELINGS AS SHE WAS PARADED BY THE HARVARD AND PRINCETON STANDS WHERE SAT DOZENS OF HER FORMER DEVOTEES CAN BE IMAGINED SHE TRIED TO WALK A LITTLE AHEAD
BURNE HURRIED ON AND IT WAS SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE AMORY HEARD AN ACCOUNT OF THE ENSUING CONVERSATION BURNE HAD COME INTO THE EDITOR'S SANCTUM DISPLAYING THE PAPER CHEERFULLY HELLO JESSE HELLO THERE SAVONAROLA
OF COURSE I PEOPLED THE WOODS WITH EVERYTHING GHASTLY JUST LIKE YOU DO DON'T YOU I DO AMORY ADMITTED WELL I BEGAN ANALYZING IT
SHE TRIED TO WALK A LITTLE BEHIND BUT THEY STAYED CLOSE THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT WHOM SHE WAS WITH TALKING IN LOUD VOICES OF THEIR FRIENDS ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM UNTIL SHE COULD ALMOST HEAR HER ACQUAINTANCES WHISPERING
ABOUT A HUNDRED JUNIORS AND SENIORS RESIGNED FROM THEIR CLUBS IN A FINAL FURY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND THE CLUBS IN HELPLESSNESS TURNED UPON BURNE THEIR FINEST WEAPON RIDICULE EVERY ONE WHO KNEW HIM LIKED HIM BUT WHAT HE STOOD FOR AND HE BEGAN TO STAND FOR MORE ALL THE TIME
BURNE I DISAGREE WITH YOU ALTOGETHER HOW ABOUT THE SUPERMAN WELL HE'S EVIL I THINK YET HE'S STRONG AND SANE I'VE NEVER MET HIM I'LL BET THOUGH THAT HE'S STUPID OR INSANE I'VE MET HIM OVER AND OVER AND HE'S NEITHER
AND WHEN HE HAD TALKED FOR FIVE MINUTES AMORY KNEW THAT THIS KEEN ENTHUSIASM HAD IN IT NO QUALITY OF DILETTANTISM THE INTENSE POWER AMORY FELT LATER IN BURNE HOLIDAY DIFFERED FROM THE ADMIRATION HE HAD HAD FOR HUMBIRD
ONE IS ON THE SENIOR COUNCIL AND OF THE DARK HAIRED MEN IT'S ONLY ONE IN FIFTY IT'S TRUE BURNE AGREED THE LIGHT HAIRED MAN IS A HIGHER TYPE GENERALLY SPEAKING
BUT THIS FAD OF POPULAR PREACHERS RISING ON THEIR TOES IN SIMULATED VIRILITY
BUT THIS IS THE REAL THING ABSOLUTELY I THINK IT'LL GO THROUGH FOR PETE'S SAKE TELL ME MORE ABOUT IT WELL BEGAN TOM
GOOD LORD TOM YOU USED TO STAND OUT AGAINST PEOPLE SUCCESS HAS COMPLETELY CONVENTIONALIZED YOU TOM GREW RATHER ANNOYED WHAT'S HE TRYING TO DO BE EXCESSIVELY HOLY NO NOT LIKE ANYBODY YOU'VE EVER SEEN
WHICH ONLY GOES TO PROVE THE RARE ENERGY OF SOPHOMORE HUMOR UNDER EFFICIENT LEADERSHIP THEN AGAIN THAT VERY FALL BURNE HAD CAUSED A SENSATION A CERTAIN PHYLLIS STYLES AN INTERCOLLEGIATE PROM TROTTER HAD FAILED TO GET HER YEARLY INVITATION TO THE HARVARD PRINCETON GAME
AND THE KREUTZER SONATA OF COURSE BUT TOLSTOI IS MOSTLY IN THE ORIGINAL RUSSIAN AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED HE'S THE GREATEST MAN IN HUNDREDS OF YEARS CRIED BURNE ENTHUSIASTICALLY
BURNE SEEMED TO BE CLIMBING HEIGHTS WHERE OTHERS WOULD BE FOREVER UNABLE TO GET A FOOTHOLD I TELL YOU AMORY DECLARED TO TOM HE'S THE FIRST CONTEMPORARY I'VE EVER MET
BURNE WAS DRAWING FARTHER AND FARTHER AWAY FROM THE WORLD ABOUT HIM HE RESIGNED THE VICE PRESIDENCY OF THE SENIOR CLASS AND TOOK TO READING AND WALKING AS ALMOST HIS ONLY PURSUITS HE VOLUNTARILY ATTENDED GRADUATE LECTURES IN PHILOSOPHY AND BIOLOGY
AND THE POINT OF ABOLISHING THE CLUBS WAS BROUGHT UP BY SOME ONE EVERYBODY THERE LEAPED AT IT IT HAD BEEN IN EACH ONE'S MIND MORE OR LESS AND IT JUST NEEDED A SPARK TO BRING IT OUT FINE I SWEAR I THINK IT'LL BE MOST ENTERTAINING
THAT HAD BEEN BURNE DYNAMICALLY HUMOROUS FUNDAMENTALLY SERIOUS
AND AROUND SMALL TABLES AT THE NASSAU INN
BUT THAT NIGHT AMORY WAS STRUCK BY BURNE'S INTENSE EARNESTNESS A QUALITY HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ASSOCIATE ONLY WITH THE DREAD STUPIDITY AND BY THE GREAT ENTHUSIASM THAT STRUCK DEAD CHORDS IN HIS HEART
YET THE WORLD IS FULL OF DARK SILENT MEN AND LANGUOROUS BRUNETTES
PROPERTY OF DEAN HOLLISTER BOUGHT AND PAID FOR
AND ENTERTAIN SOME HARVARD FRIENDS SHE'LL SEE HE INFORMED A DELEGATION WHO ARRIVED IN HIS ROOM TO JOSH HIM
THE NEXT MORNING HE MET BURNE HURRYING ALONG MC COSH WALK AFTER A RECITATION WHITHER BOUND TSAR OVER TO THE PRINCE OFFICE TO SEE FERRENBY
FINALLY TOOK A POSITION THAT WAS BRILLIANTLY NEUTRAL IN FACT
FIRST AND PARTLY BY ACCIDENT THEY STRUCK ON CERTAIN BOOKS A DEFINITE TYPE OF BIOGRAPHICAL NOVEL THAT AMORY CHRISTENED QUEST BOOKS IN THE QUEST BOOK
NONE OTHER GODS SINISTER STREET AND THE RESEARCH MAGNIFICENT WERE EXAMPLES OF SUCH BOOKS IT WAS THE LATTER OF THESE THREE THAT GRIPPED BURNE HOLIDAY AND MADE HIM WONDER IN THE BEGINNING OF SENIOR YEAR
YES BUT THAT QUOTATION JESSE SAT UP WHAT QUOTATION YOU KNOW HE WHO IS NOT WITH ME IS AGAINST ME WELL WHAT ABOUT IT JESSE WAS PUZZLED BUT NOT ALARMED WELL YOU SAY HERE LET ME SEE
IF YOU ASK ME CRIED PHYLLIS QUICKLY OF COURSE I DO SAID BURNE FEEBLY
THEY HAD HASHED AND REHASHED FOR MANY A FRUGAL CONVERSATIONAL MEAL THAT NIGHT THEY DISCUSSED THE CLUBS UNTIL TWELVE AND IN THE MAIN THEY AGREED WITH BURNE
THEN I KNEW I WAS THROUGH BEING AFRAID OF THE DARK LORDY AMORY BREATHED
I'D HAVE COME IN WELL BURNE SAID SUDDENLY AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE WE'RE HALF WAY THROUGH LET'S TURN BACK ON THE RETURN HE LAUNCHED INTO A DISCUSSION OF WILL IT'S THE WHOLE THING HE ASSERTED
I THINK THEY'RE THE UGLIEST LOOKING CROWD I EVER CAME ACROSS
OH AMORY LOOK AT THAT FOREHEAD ON EMERSON LOOK AT TOLSTOI'S EYES HIS TONE WAS REPROACHFUL AMORY SHOOK HIS HEAD NO CALL THEM REMARKABLE LOOKING
THAT'S WHY I THINK YOU'RE WRONG I'M SURE I'M NOT AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE IN IMPRISONMENT EXCEPT FOR THE INSANE ON THIS POINT AMORY COULD NOT AGREE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT LIFE AND HISTORY WERE RIFE WITH THE STRONG CRIMINAL KEEN BUT OFTEN SELF DELUDING
BROAD BROWED AND STRONG CHINNED WITH A FINENESS IN THE HONEST GRAY EYES THAT WERE LIKE KERRY'S BURNE WAS A MAN WHO GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPRESSION OF BIGNESS AND SECURITY STUBBORN THAT WAS EVIDENT
BANISHING BOTH DULL SECURITY AND FOOLISH ALARM FROM HIS MIND REDOUBLED HIS CARE HIS CHIEF METHOD OF ACTION WAS BY PUBLIC MEETINGS AT WHICH HE SPOKE VEHEMENTLY AGAINST THE RIVAL CANDIDATE HIS COMMITTEE HELD HUGE MEETINGS ON SATURDAY EVENINGS
THIS BUSY MAN TAXED HIS INGENUITY TO PLEASE THEM AND HE SOMETIMES SUCCEEDED HE GOT THEM CARDS FOR FASHIONABLE FUNCTIONS AND BOXES AT THE OPERA HE FURNISHED MADEMOISELLE CLARENCE WITH SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES OF APPEARING TO GREAT ADVANTAGE
THE ANGELS WILL AFFECT AN EQUIVOCAL AMBIGUOUS MYSTERIOUS BEAUTY WHICH WILL TROUBLE HEARTS WHAT DESIRE FOR HEAVEN WILL THESE REPRESENTATIONS IMPART NONE
YOUR CONSTITUENCY IS ONE OF THE FINEST IN ALCA AND THERE ARE FRESH IMPROVEMENTS MADE IN IT EVERY DAY MADAME UNFORTUNATELY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A STROLL THROUGH IT ANY LONGER
THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO OR EVEN LONGER AT THAT PERIOD OF INDIGENCE AND SIMPLICITY THE MUNICIPAL MUSEUMS THOUGH USUALLY KEPT SHUT WERE ALWAYS OPENED TO FOREIGNERS ONE EVENING AN OLD WOMAN WITH A CANDLE SHOWED ME FOR HALF A LIRA
AND IN PARTICULAR AT A GARDEN PARTY WHICH ALTHOUGH GIVEN BY A MINISTER WAS REGARDED AS REALLY FASHIONABLE AND GAINED ITS FIRST SUCCESS IN SOCIETY CIRCLES FOR THE REPUBLIC
MARGARITONE'S VISION
BUT PROFESSOR HADDOCK SOON DISPLAYED HIS FASTIDIOUS INSOLENCE IT SEEMS TO ME SAID HE THAT THE PENGUIN LADIES HAVE MADE A GREAT FUSS SINCE THROUGH SAINT MAEL'S AGENCY THEY BECAME VIVIPAROUS
BEING NOW ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH MINISTERS AND WITH THE PRESIDENT EVELINE CONTINUED TO WEAR HER ARISTOCRATIC AND PIOUS AFFECTATIONS AND THESE WON FOR HER THE SYMPATHY OF THE CHIEF PERSONAGES IN THE ANTI CLERICAL AND DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC
WOMEN FOR THE MOST PART HAVE BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED BY THEIR HUSBANDS THAT THEY HAVE NOT COURAGE ENOUGH TO BEGIN AGAIN WITH SOMEBODY ELSE I MYSELF HAVE BEEN MET BY THIS OBSTACLE SEVERAL TIMES IN MY ATTEMPTS AT SEDUCTION
DO NOT GIVE THEM A BAD NAME ANSWERED THE DEPUTY THEY ARE OUR GREAT NATIONAL INDUSTRY I KNOW THE PENGUINS OF TO DAY MAKE ME THINK OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS
THE YOUNG GIRL SHOWED HERSELF AMIABLE ENGAGING ATTRACTIVE AND FULL OF PROMISES
SAINT MARTHA A BELLY SAINT BARBARA HIPS
MADAME CLARENCE WHO NOW LIKED ATTENTION THOUGHT HIM AGREEABLE
ROADS WHICH IT CANNOT TEAR UP WITH ITS FEROCIOUS TYRES AND FROM WHICH IT WILL SEND NO CLOUDS OF POISONOUS DUST INTO HUMAN LUNGS WE OUGHT NOT TO ALLOW SLOWER VEHICLES OR MERE ANIMALS TO GO UPON THOSE ROADS
WE HAVE ONE BAD HABIT
EVEN THEN WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT REALLY TAKES PLACE FOR THE REASON THAT WHAT IS HIDDEN IS NOT SEEN THIS IS A CONDITION NECESSARY TO THE EXISTENCE OF ALL SOCIETY
WE CANNOT BE TOO SORRY FOR THIS LOSS FOR MY OWN PART I FEEL IT CRUELLY FOR I VENERATE THE PENGUIN ANTIQUITIES AND I ADORE THE PRIMITIVES THEY ARE DELIGHTFUL I DO NOT SAY THE ARE ALL ALIKE FOR THAT WOULD BE UNTRUE
WHO HAD NEVER SET FOOT OUTSIDE OF HIS POLITICAL WORLD OF ELECTORS AND ELECTED THOUGHT MADAME CLARENCE'S DRAWING ROOM MOST SELECT ITS MISTRESS EXQUISITE AND HER DAUGHTER AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL HIS VISITS BECAME FREQUENT AND HE PAID COURT TO BOTH OF THEM
I PICTURE TO MYSELF THE PENGUIN PRIMITIVES IN CONFORMITY WITH THE WORKS OF THAT MASTER IT WILL NOT THEREFORE BE THOUGHT SUPERFLUOUS IF IN THIS PLACE I CONSIDER HIS WORKS WITH SOME ATTENTION IF NOT IN DETAIL AT LEAST UNDER THEIR MORE GENERAL AND
AND SHE ACCEPTED A LITTLE MOVED ALMOST DISQUIETED SHE VERY NEARLY BECAME THE VICTIM OF HER DARING AND ONLY AVOIDED DEFEAT BY AN OFFENSIVE MEASURE AUDACIOUSLY CARRIED OUT THIS WAS THE MOST FOOLISH ESCAPADE IN HER UNMARRIED LIFE
DOES NOT SHRINK FROM PLACING THE MADONNA OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY ON A LEVEL WITH THE MASTERPIECES OF CHRISTIAN ART BY GIVING TO THE VIRGIN'S HEAD SAYS SIR JAMES TUCKETT A THIRD OF THE TOTAL HEIGHT OF THE FIGURE
RECONSTRUCTIONS AND ALL OTHER FRUITFUL OPERATIONS WE BUILD TO DAY IN AN ADMIRABLE STYLE SAID HE EVERYWHERE MAJESTIC AVENUES ARE BEING REARED
NOR PERUGIA THAT COMPLETED MY INITIATION
AND WE SHOULD ESTABLISH GARAGES UPON THEM AND FOOT BRIDGES OVER THEM AND SO CREATE ORDER AND HARMONY AMONG THE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION OF THE FUTURE THAT IS THE WISH OF EVERY GOOD CITIZEN
AND THE CHILD WE SEE IN SUCH A CRITICISM AS THIS A SHINING REFLECTION SO TO SPEAK OF THE WORK WHICH IT EXALTS YET MAC SILLY THE SERAPHIC AESTHETE OF EDINBURGH HAS EXPRESSED IN A STILL MORE MOVING AND PENETRATING FASHION
REGRETTING THAT HE HAD LIVED TO SEE A NEW FORM OF ART ARISING AND THE NEW ARTISTS CROWNED WITH FAME THESE LINES WHICH I TRANSLATE LITERALLY HAVE INSPIRED SIR JAMES TUCKETT WITH WHAT ARE PERHAPS THE FINEST PAGES IN HIS WORK
AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES WERE SOON TO BE AVENGED FOR THIS CRUEL CONTEMPT THERE WAS BORN IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IN THE BIBLICAL VILLAGES AND REFORMED COTTAGES OF PIOUS ENGLAND A MULTITUDE OF LITTLE SAMUELS AND LITTLE SAINT JOHNS WITH HAIR CURLING LIKE LAMBS
THE PENGUIN CRITICS VIE WITH ONE ANOTHER IN AFFIRMING THAT PENGUIN ART HAS FROM ITS ORIGIN BEEN DISTINGUISHED BY A POWERFUL AND PLEASING ORIGINALITY AND THAT WE MAY LOOK ELSEWHERE IN VAIN FOR THE QUALITIES OF GRACE AND REASON THAT CHARACTERISE ITS EARLIEST WORKS
LOGIC BEING A PECULIARLY FRENCH QUALITY EVEN IF THIS IS DENIED IT MUST AT LEAST BE ADMITTED THAT TO FRANCE BELONGS THE CREDIT OF HAVING KEPT PRIMITIVES WHEN THE OTHER NATIONS KNEW THEM NO LONGER
AND IN IT I DISCOVERED A PAINTING BY MARGARITONE A SAINT FRANCIS THE PIOUS SADNESS OF WHICH MOVED ME TO TEARS I WAS DEEPLY TOUCHED
IN WHICH THE AUTHOR COMPLAINED THAT AN IRRATIONAL CUSTOM WENT ON PROFESSOR HADDOCK PREVENTS RESPECTABLE YOUNG LADIES FROM MAKING LOVE A THING THEY WOULD ENJOY DOING
WHILST MERCENARY GIRLS DO IT TOO MUCH AND WITHOUT GETTING ANY ENJOYMENT OUT OF IT IT IS INDEED DEPLORABLE
CROWDS OF TUMULTUOUS NATIVITIES OPULENT HOLY FAMILIES EMPHATIC CRUCIFIXIONS
AND WHICH WERE GARTERED ABOVE THE KNEES WITH THE SINEWS OF A DEER A POUCH AND HORN COMPLETED HIS PERSONAL ACCOUTERMENTS THOUGH A RIFLE OF GREAT LENGTH WHICH THE THEORY OF THE MORE INGENIOUS WHITES HAD TAUGHT THEM WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL FIREARMS
BUT EVERY NERVE AND MUSCLE APPEARED STRUNG AND INDURATED BY UNREMITTED EXPOSURE AND TOIL HE WORE A HUNTING SHIRT OF FOREST GREEN FRINGED WITH FADED YELLOW AND A SUMMER CAP OF SKINS WHICH HAD BEEN SHORN OF THEIR FUR
YET WHEN THE SENSE OF SACRED PRESENCE FIRES AND STRONG DEVOTION TO THE SKIES ASPIRES POUR FORTH THY FERVOURS FOR A HEALTHFUL MIND OBEDIENT PASSIONS AND A WILL RESIGN'D
FOR I HAVE BEEN THERE AND HAVE SEEN THEM THOUGH WHY WATER WHICH IS SO SWEET IN THE SHADE SHOULD BECOME BITTER IN THE SUN IS AN ALTERATION FOR WHICH I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO ACCOUNT
HIS BODY WHICH WAS NEARLY NAKED PRESENTED A TERRIFIC EMBLEM OF DEATH DRAWN IN INTERMINGLED COLORS OF WHITE AND BLACK
DOES NOT THIS STREAM AT OUR FEET RUN TOWARD THE SUMMER UNTIL ITS WATERS GROW SALT AND THE CURRENT FLOWS UPWARD
THE WATERS IN THE WOODS AND ON THE GREAT LAKES RUN DOWNWARD UNTIL THEY LIE LIKE MY HAND SAID THE INDIAN STRETCHING THE LIMB HORIZONTALLY BEFORE HIM AND THEN THEY RUN NO MORE
NOR FEEL A PRIDE IN STRIVING TO OUTDO THEM FOR MYSELF I CONCLUDE THE BUMPPOS COULD SHOOT FOR I HAVE A NATURAL TURN WITH A RIFLE WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION
THE NECESSARY EXPENSE OF PREPARING A WORK OF SUCH MAGNITUDE FOR THE PRESS MUST HAVE BEEN A CONSIDERABLE DEDUCTION FROM THE PRICE STIPULATED TO BE PAID FOR THE COPY RIGHT
LEAVING THE UNSUSPECTING HEYWARD AND HIS CONFIDING COMPANIONS TO PENETRATE STILL DEEPER INTO A FOREST THAT CONTAINED SUCH TREACHEROUS INMATES WE MUST USE AN AUTHOR'S PRIVILEGE
THE SECRET AMBUSH OF A SPECIOUS PRAY'R IMPLORE HIS AID IN HIS DECISIONS REST
I SHOULD THINK A RIFLE IN THE HANDS OF THEIR GRANDFATHERS WAS NOT SO DANGEROUS AS A HICKORY BOW AND A GOOD FLINT HEAD MIGHT BE IF DRAWN WITH INDIAN JUDGMENT AND SENT BY AN INDIAN EYE
AS OUR HOLY COMMANDMENTS TELL US ALL GOOD AND EVIL GIFTS ARE BESTOWED THOUGH I SHOULD BE LOATH TO ANSWER FOR OTHER PEOPLE IN SUCH A MATTER BUT EVERY STORY HAS ITS TWO SIDES
AND THE CURRENT DEMANDED THE INDIAN WHO EXPECTED HIS REPLY WITH THAT SORT OF INTEREST THAT A MAN FEELS IN THE CONFIRMATION OF TESTIMONY AT WHICH HE MARVELS EVEN WHILE HE RESPECTS IT
WITH A SHORT AND PERSPICUOUS RECOMMENDATION OF EACH ARTICLE AS ALSO THE VISION OF THEODORE THE HERMIT FOUND IN HIS CELL
AND SHADOWING ITS DARK CURRENT WITH A DEEPER HUE THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE BEGINNING TO GROW LESS FIERCE AND THE INTENSE HEAT OF THE DAY WAS LESSENED AS THE COOLER VAPORS OF THE SPRINGS AND FOUNTAINS ROSE ABOVE THEIR LEAFY BEDS
WHILE ONE OF THESE LOITERERS SHOWED THE RED SKIN AND WILD ACCOUTERMENTS OF A NATIVE OF THE WOODS THE OTHER EXHIBITED THROUGH THE MASK OF HIS RUDE AND NEARLY SAVAGE EQUIPMENTS
THAN WITH THE PROFOUND REFLECTION OF
DO THEY TELL THE YOUNG WARRIORS THAT THE PALE FACES MET THE RED MEN PAINTED FOR WAR AND ARMED WITH THE STONE HATCHET AND WOODEN GUN I AM NOT A PREJUDICED MAN NOR ONE WHO VAUNTS HIMSELF ON HIS NATURAL PRIVILEGES
THE BRIGHTER THOUGH SUN BURNED AND LONG FACED COMPLEXION OF ONE WHO MIGHT CLAIM DESCENT FROM A EUROPEAN PARENTAGE
GARRICK APPLIED TO THE REVEREND DOCTOR TAYLOR TO INTERPOSE
AND RESTED IN THE ATMOSPHERE STILL THAT BREATHING SILENCE WHICH MARKS THE DROWSY SULTRINESS OF AN AMERICAN LANDSCAPE IN JULY PERVADED THE SECLUDED SPOT INTERRUPTED ONLY BY THE LOW VOICES OF THE MEN
LISTEN HAWKEYE AND YOUR EAR SHALL DRINK NO LIE TIS WHAT MY FATHERS HAVE SAID AND WHAT THE MOHICANS HAVE DONE HE HESITATED A SINGLE INSTANT
AND BENDING A CAUTIOUS GLANCE TOWARD HIS COMPANION HE CONTINUED IN A MANNER THAT WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN INTERROGATION AND ASSERTION
THESE GOODS FOR MAN THE LAWS OF HEAVEN ORDAIN THESE GOODS HE GRANTS
LEANED AGAINST A NEIGHBORING SAPLING THE EYE OF THE HUNTER OR SCOUT WHICHEVER HE MIGHT BE WAS SMALL QUICK KEEN AND RESTLESS ROVING WHILE HE SPOKE ON EVERY SIDE OF HIM AS IF IN QUEST OF GAME
AND I AM WILLING TO OWN THAT MY PEOPLE HAVE MANY WAYS OF WHICH AS AN HONEST MAN I CAN'T APPROVE IT IS ONE OF THEIR CUSTOMS TO WRITE IN BOOKS WHAT THEY HAVE DONE AND SEEN INSTEAD OF TELLING THEM IN THEIR VILLAGES
MUST HELPLESS MAN IN IGNORANCE SEDATE ROLL DARKLING DOWN THE TORRENT OF HIS FATE SHALL NO DISLIKE ALARM NO WISHES RISE
AND SHIFT THE SCENE A FEW MILES TO THE WESTWARD OF THE PLACE WHERE WE HAVE LAST SEEN THEM ON THAT DAY TWO MEN WERE LINGERING ON THE BANKS OF A SMALL BUT RAPID STREAM WITHIN AN HOUR'S JOURNEY OF THE ENCAMPMENT OF WEBB
LAY CARELESSLY ACROSS HIS BARE AND SINEWY KNEE
THAT HAPPINESS MAY BE ATTAINED
SO I ASK YOU CHINGACHGOOK WHAT PASSED ACCORDING TO THE TRADITIONS OF THE RED MEN WHEN OUR FATHERS FIRST MET A SILENCE OF A MINUTE SUCCEEDED DURING WHICH THE INDIAN SAT MUTE
I AM NO SCHOLAR AND I CARE NOT WHO KNOWS IT BUT JUDGING FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN AT DEER CHASES AND SQUIRREL HUNTS OF THE SPARKS BELOW
BUT WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE OR CHANGES FOR THE BETTER IS WINE
AND AS FOR ME SAID PORTHOS I SWEAR NOTHING BUT I'M CHOKED FORSOOTH IF I WERE OBLIGED TO FIGHT AGAINST YOU
HE DARED NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK AND RAOUL WENT AWAY HIS HEAD UNCOVERED ATHOS REMAINED MOTIONLESS LOOKING AFTER HIM UNTIL HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE STREET THEN THE COUNT THREW THE BRIDLE OF HIS HORSE INTO THE HANDS OF A PEASANT
THEN CALLED L'ABREUVOIR PEPIN
IT WAS THOSE VERY TERRIBLE OLD DAYS THAT MADE THE PRESENT SO EXCESSIVELY DELIGHTFUL AND THE BLOW WAS SO GREAT HE RUSHED OUT OVERCOME AND FORGOT TO SHUT THE DOOR THE TWO FRIENDS REMAINED ALONE TO SPEAK OF THE FUTURE AND TO BUILD CASTLES IN THE AIR
SWEAR ON THIS CROSS WHICH IN SPITE OF ITS MAGNIFICENT MATERIAL IS STILL A CROSS
NOTHING BUT A PHANTOM TO WHOM HE LENT A SOUL AND YET SO POWERFUL IS MAJESTY AMONGST US THIS MAN HAS NOT EVEN THE HONOR OF A TOMB AT THE FEET OF HIM IN WHOSE SERVICE HIS LIFE WAS WORN AWAY REMEMBER RAOUL THIS
AND HE LOOKED AT D'ARTAGNAN WITH AN AIR OF REPROACH HE STAGGERED AND HIS VOICE WAS ALMOST CHOKED YES AND NO WE SHALL SERVE IN A CAMPAIGN SEEK OUT ALL SORTS OF ADVENTURES RETURN IN SHORT TO OUR FORMER LIFE THESE LAST WORDS FELL ON MOUSQUETON LIKE A THUNDERBOLT
AFTER SPEAKING IN A LOW VOICE TO THE LACKEY WHO INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THEM IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THEIR ROOMS RAOUL DELIGHTED AT THE COUNT'S COMPANIONSHIP PERCEIVED OR AFFECTED TO PERCEIVE NOTHING OF THIS BYPLAY
HE WHO FIRES THE FIRST SHOT RARELY HITS HIS MAN FOR HE FIRES WITH THE APPREHENSION OF BEING DISARMED BEFORE AN ARMED FOE THEN WHILST HE FIRES MAKE YOUR HORSE REAR
WE ARE JUDGES OF WOUNDS WE OLD SOLDIERS ATHOS ADDED SMILING THANK YOU SIR ANSWERED THE YOUNG MAN MUCH MOVED THEY ARRIVED THAT VERY MOMENT AT THE GATE OF THE TOWN GUARDED BY TWO SENTINELS HERE COMES A YOUNG GENTLEMAN SAID ONE OF THEM
GENTLEMEN NEVERTHELESS OF RANK AND CONDITION ARE AS NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH THE COLD CORPSE THERE EXTENDED I SHALL ADORE GOD SIR SAID RAOUL RESPECT ROYALTY AND EVER SERVE THE KING AND IF DEATH BE MY LOT
ASHAMED OF SO MUCH ATTENTION IN AN INSTANT I SHALL BE DRESSED ATHOS THEN CALLED OLIVAIN
HE REMEMBERED THAT ALL THE FIRST PART OF HIS LIFE HAD BEEN EMBITTERED BY A WOMAN AND HE THOUGHT WITH ALARM OF THE INFLUENCE LOVE MIGHT ASSUME OVER SO FINE AND AT THE SAME TIME SO VIGOROUS AN ORGANIZATION AS THAT OF RAOUL
HE HIMSELF FURBISHED A SWORD WHICH HE DREW FROM ITS PERFUMED LEATHER SHEATH HE EXAMINED IT TO SEE IF ITS HILT WAS WELL GUARDED AND IF THE BLADE WAS FIRMLY ATTACHED TO THE HILT THEN HE PLACED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VALISE BELONGING TO THE YOUNG MAN
EXTENDED HIS HAND WITH THE AIR OF SUPREME COMMAND WHICH CHARACTERIZED HIM ALONE DREW OUT HIS SWORD AND THE SCABBARD AT THE SAME TIME BROKE THE BLADE IN THE SHEATH ON HIS KNEE AND THREW THE PIECES TO HIS RIGHT THEN TURNING TO ARAMIS
HE LOOKED LONG ON THIS YOUNG MAN WHOSE SMILING MOUTH AND HALF CLOSED EYES BESPOKE SOFT DREAMS AND LIGHTEST SLUMBER AS IF HIS GUARDIAN ANGEL WATCHED OVER HIM WITH SOLICITUDE AND AFFECTION
TAKE CARE RAOUL I HAVE ALREADY OFTEN TOLD YOU OF THIS YOU MUST NOT FORGET IT FOR IT IS A GREAT DEFECT IN A RIDER SEE YOUR HORSE IS TIRED ALREADY HE FROTHS AT THE MOUTH WHILST MINE LOOKS AS IF HE HAD ONLY JUST LEFT THE STABLE
BY THE QUALITY OF THE WINE HE DIRECTED TO BE SERVED THEREFORE WHEN AT DESSERT UPON A SIGN FROM D'ARTAGNAN PORTHOS HAD SENT AWAY HIS SERVANTS AND THE TWO FRIENDS WERE ALONE PORTHOS SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHO WILL ATTEND YOU IN YOUR CAMPAIGNS
SO FRESH HIS OWN YOUTH SEEMED TO REAPPEAR BRINGING WITH IT ALL THOSE SAVOURY REMEMBRANCES WHICH ARE LIKE PERFUMES MORE THAN THOUGHTS BETWEEN THE PAST AND THE PRESENT WAS AN INEFFABLE ABYSS
AND HE ADDED TURNING TO PORTHOS HERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO'S OF THE SAME OPINION AS MYSELF PORTHOS WHO HAD NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD ANSWERED MERELY BY A WORD AND A GESTURE
LET US PUT OUR SWORDS INTO OUR LEFT HANDS AND SHAKE HANDS WITH THE RIGHT
WHO BOWED AND PROCEEDED TOWARD THE BASEMENT COME RAOUL HE SAID LET US FOLLOW THIS MAN THE VERGER OPENED THE IRON GRATING THAT GUARDED THE ROYAL TOMBS AND STOOD ON THE TOPMOST STEP
WELL SAID PORTHOS IF ANY ONE HAD TOLD YOU IN THE OLD TIMES THAT THE DAY WOULD COME WHEN PLANCHET WOULD RESCUE ROCHEFORT AND THAT YOU WOULD PROTECT HIM IN IT I SHOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED HIM BUT MEN ARE CHANGED BY EVENTS THERE IS NOTHING TRUER THAN THAT SAID PORTHOS
HE HAS SET UP A LITTLE SHOP IN THE RUE DES LOMBARDS AND IS NOW A CONFECTIONER AH HE IS A CONFECTIONER IN THE RUE DES LOMBARDS
GENTLEMEN HE SAID OUR PRESENCE HERE IS THE BEST PROOF OF FORMER FRIENDSHIP NOT ONE OF US HAS FAILED THE OTHERS AT THIS RENDEZVOUS NOT ONE HAS THEREFORE TO REPROACH HIMSELF HEAR ME COUNT REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN
WELL WHY SHOULD NOT WE TOO BELONG TO A PARTY YOU HAD YOUR SECRET AND WE HAD OURS WE DIDN'T EXCHANGE THEM SO MUCH THE BETTER IT PROVES THAT WE KNOW HOW TO KEEP OUR SECRETS I DO NOT REPROACH YOU MONSIEUR SAID D'ARTAGNAN
ROYALTY IS THE GIFT OF GOD WHENEVER YOU HESITATE AS TO WHOM YOU OUGHT TO SERVE ABANDON THE EXTERIOR THE MATERIAL APPEARANCE FOR THE INVISIBLE PRINCIPLE FOR THE INVISIBLE PRINCIPLE IS EVERYTHING
TIS ONLY BECAUSE MONSIEUR DE LA FERE HAS SPOKEN OF FRIENDSHIP THAT I QUESTION YOUR CONDUCT
NO INDEED SIR ANSWERED RAOUL
D'ARTAGNAN WHO AS A GASCON WAS INCLINED TO SOBRIETY
WE SHOULD BE SO ON THIS OCCASION IF ONLY TO BE FAITHFUL TO OUR OATH SAID ARAMIS AH I'M READY TO DO WHAT YOU WILL CRIED PORTHOS EVEN TO SWEAR BY MAHOMET DEVIL TAKE ME IF I'VE EVER BEEN SO HAPPY AS AT THIS MOMENT
I NEVER KNEW ANYBODY CATCH ANYTHING UP THE THAMES EXCEPT MINNOWS AND DEAD CATS BUT THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO OF COURSE WITH FISHING THE LOCAL FISHERMAN'S GUIDE DOESN'T SAY A WORD ABOUT CATCHING ANYTHING ALL IT SAYS IS THE PLACE IS
THEY SAID THEY WOULD CONSIDER THE IDEA IF THE NUMBER WERE DOUBLED AND EACH FISH COUNTED AS TWENTY IF EVER YOU HAVE AN EVENING TO SPARE UP THE RIVER I SHOULD ADVISE YOU TO DROP INTO ONE OF THE LITTLE VILLAGE INNS AND TAKE A SEAT IN THE TAP ROOM
AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME TALK LATELY OF ITS BEING MADE USE OF BY THE ANGLING FRATERNITY IN GENERAL INDEED THE COMMITTEE OF THE THAMES ANGLER'S ASSOCIATION DID RECOMMEND ITS ADOPTION ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO BUT SOME OF THE OLDER MEMBERS OPPOSED IT
JACK AND PERCH MAY BE ABOUT THERE INDEED I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEY ARE YOU CAN SEE THEM THERE IN SHOALS WHEN YOU ARE OUT FOR A WALK ALONG THE BANKS
BUT MY FRIEND HERE AND MYSELF WOULD BE SO MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WOULD TELL US HOW YOU CAUGHT THAT TROUT UP THERE WHY WHO TOLD YOU I CAUGHT THAT TROUT WAS THE SURPRISED QUERY
HE SAID THAT BRINGING HOME THAT TROUT HAD SAVED HIM FROM A WHACKING AND THAT EVEN HIS SCHOOL MASTER HAD SAID IT WAS WORTH THE RULE OF THREE AND PRACTICE PUT TOGETHER HE WAS CALLED OUT OF THE ROOM AT THIS POINT
AND THEN HE GREW DISSATISFIED WITH IT NOBODY BELIEVED HIM WHEN HE TOLD THEM THAT HE ONLY DOUBLED AND HE THEREFORE GAINED NO CREDIT THAT WAY WHATEVER WHILE HIS MODERATION PUT HIM AT A DISADVANTAGE AMONG THE OTHER ANGLERS
AND OUT HE WENT AND LEFT US ALONE WE COULD NOT TAKE OUR EYES OFF THE FISH AFTER THAT IT REALLY WAS A REMARKABLY FINE FISH WE WERE STILL LOOKING AT IT WHEN THE LOCAL CARRIER WHO HAD JUST STOPPED AT THE INN
OH NO NOT NOW SIR IT DID USED TO KNOCK ME OVER A BIT AT FIRST BUT LOR LOVE YOU ME AND THE MISSUS WE LISTENS TO EM ALL DAY NOW IT'S WHAT YOU'RE USED TO YOU KNOW IT'S WHAT YOU'RE USED TO
IT WILL BE ALL THE SAME THE ANGLER'S GUIDE TO THE THAMES SAYS THAT JACK AND PERCH ARE ALSO TO BE HAD ABOUT HERE BUT THERE THE ANGLER'S GUIDE IS WRONG
AND GOT OUR CLOTHES WASHED WE HAD TRIED WASHING THEM OURSELVES IN THE RIVER UNDER GEORGE'S SUPERINTENDENCE AND IT HAD BEEN A FAILURE INDEED IT HAD BEEN MORE THAN A FAILURE
AND WITHOUT EVEN A TINGE OF BITTERNESS IN HIS TONE AS HE REFILLS HIS PIPE AND REQUESTS THE LANDLORD TO BRING HIM THREE OF SCOTCH COLD THERE IS A PAUSE AFTER THIS
YES SIR REPLIED THE GENIAL OLD FELLOW I CAUGHT HIM JUST BELOW THE LOCK LEASTWAYS WHAT WAS THE LOCK THEN ONE FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND THE REMARKABLE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT I CAUGHT HIM WITH A FLY
THE RIVER BETWEEN READING AND HENLEY WAS MUCH CLEANER AFTER WE HAD WASHED OUR CLOTHES IN IT THAN IT WAS BEFORE ALL THE DIRT CONTAINED IN THE RIVER BETWEEN READING AND HENLEY WE COLLECTED DURING THAT WASH AND WORKED IT INTO OUR CLOTHES
LIGHTS HIS PIPE AND COMMENCES TO PUFF IN SILENCE HE LETS THE YOUNGSTERS BRAG AWAY FOR A WHILE AND THEN DURING A MOMENTARY LULL HE REMOVES THE PIPE FROM HIS MOUTH AND REMARKS AS HE KNOCKS THE ASHES OUT AGAINST THE BARS
FANCY JIM BATES AND JOE MUGGLES AND MISTER JONES AND OLD BILLY MAUNDERS ALL TELLING YOU THAT THEY HAD CAUGHT IT HA HA HA WELL THAT IS GOOD SAID THE HONEST OLD FELLOW LAUGHING HEARTILY
BUT THIS IS A MISTAKE MERE BALD FABRICATION IS USELESS THE VERIEST TYRO CAN MANAGE THAT IT IS IN THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL DETAIL THE EMBELLISHING TOUCHES OF PROBABILITY
WOULD REQUIRE MORE PLAY OF FANCY MORE POWER OF INVENTION THAN I APPEARED TO POSSESS SOME PEOPLE ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT ALL THAT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE A GOOD FISHERMAN IS THE ABILITY TO TELL LIES EASILY AND WITHOUT BLUSHING
YOU WILL BE NEARLY SURE TO MEET ONE OR TWO OLD ROD MEN SIPPING THEIR TODDY THERE AND THEY WILL TELL YOU ENOUGH FISHY STORIES IN HALF AN HOUR TO GIVE YOU INDIGESTION FOR A MONTH GEORGE AND I I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HARRIS
THE RIVER ABOUNDS IN PIKE ROACH DACE GUDGEON AND EELS JUST HERE AND YOU CAN SIT AND FISH FOR THEM ALL DAY SOME PEOPLE DO THEY NEVER CATCH THEM
WE SAID THAT NOBODY HAD TOLD US SO BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER WE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT IT WAS HE WHO HAD DONE IT WELL IT'S A MOST REMARKABLE THING MOST REMARKABLE
BECAUSE AS A MATTER OF FACT YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT I DID CATCH IT BUT FANCY YOUR GUESSING IT LIKE THAT DEAR ME IT'S REALLY A MOST REMARKABLE THING AND THEN HE WENT ON AND TOLD US HOW IT HAD TAKEN HIM HALF AN HOUR TO LAND IT
HE TOLD US THAT IT HAD BEEN A FINE DAY TO DAY AND WE TOLD HIM THAT IT HAD BEEN A FINE DAY YESTERDAY
NO WE TOLD HIM WE WERE STRANGERS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AH SAID THE CARRIER THEN OF COURSE HOW SHOULD YOU IT WAS NEARLY FIVE YEARS AGO THAT I CAUGHT THAT TROUT OH WAS IT YOU WHO CAUGHT IT THEN SAID I
BUT THAT AGAIN WAS AWKWARD WHEN HE HAD ONLY CAUGHT ONE OR TWO SO TO SIMPLIFY MATTERS HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO JUST DOUBLE THE QUANTITY
THE WASHERWOMAN AT STREATLEY SAID SHE FELT SHE OWED IT TO HERSELF TO CHARGE US JUST THREE TIMES THE USUAL PRICES FOR THAT WASH SHE SAID IT HAD NOT BEEN LIKE WASHING IT HAD BEEN MORE IN THE NATURE OF EXCAVATING
AND ADVISED ME TO GIVE IT UP THEY SAID THAT I WAS AN EXTREMELY NEAT THROWER AND THAT I SEEMED TO HAVE PLENTY OF GUMPTION FOR THE THING AND QUITE ENOUGH CONSTITUTIONAL LAZINESS BUT THEY WERE SURE I SHOULD NEVER MAKE ANYTHING OF A FISHERMAN
CAME TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WITH A POT OF BEER IN HIS HAND AND HE ALSO LOOKED AT THE FISH GOOD SIZED TROUT THAT SAID GEORGE TURNING ROUND TO HIM AH YOU MAY WELL SAY THAT SIR REPLIED THE MAN
WRASSE FROM THE GENUS HOLOGYMNOSUS THAT WERE NEARLY DENUDED OF SCALES BUT EXQUISITE IN FLAVOR KNIFEJAWS WITH BONY BEAKS YELLOWISH ALBACORE THAT WERE AS TASTY AS BONITO
THEIR ROLE IS NO LESS IMPORTANT THEY ABSORB THE MARINE SALTS THEY ASSIMILATE THE SOLID ELEMENTS IN THE WATER
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN I RECOGNIZED SOME IRISHMEN SOME FRENCHMEN A FEW SLAVS AND A NATIVE OF EITHER GREECE OR CRETE EVEN SO THESE MEN WERE FRUGAL OF SPEECH AND USED AMONG THEMSELVES ONLY THAT BIZARRE DIALECT
HER DESIGN OF IMPROVING THE COTTAGE IN THE SPRING HE WARMLY OPPOSED EVERY ALTERATION OF A PLACE WHICH AFFECTION HAD ESTABLISHED AS PERFECT WITH HIM WHAT HE EXCLAIMED IMPROVE THIS DEAR COTTAGE NO THAT I WILL NEVER CONSENT TO
REACHING STRATA LOCATED TWO THOUSAND METERS UNDERWATER THE THERMOMETER INDICATED A TEMPERATURE OF FOUR POINT TWO FIVE DEGREES CENTIGRADE WHICH AT THIS DEPTH SEEMED TO BE A TEMPERATURE COMMON TO ALL LATITUDES
AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE METERS
SINKS AGAIN AND BRINGS THOSE TINY ANIMALS NEW ELEMENTS TO ABSORB THE OUTCOME A DOUBLE CURRENT RISING AND FALLING CONSTANT MOVEMENT CONSTANT LIFE MORE INTENSE THAN ON LAND MORE ABUNDANT MORE INFINITE SUCH LIFE BLOOMS IN EVERY PART OF THIS OCEAN
DECKED OUT IN THE COLORS BLUE AND SILVER AND THREE MAGNIFICENT TUNA WHOSE HIGH SPEEDS COULDN'T SAVE THEM FROM OUR TRAWL
MADREPORES THEY'RE THE TRUE BUILDERS OF LIMESTONE CONTINENTS AND SO AFTER THEY'VE FINISHED DEPRIVING OUR WATER DROP OF ITS MINERAL NUTRIENTS THE DROPLET GETS LIGHTER RISES TO THE SURFACE THERE ABSORBS MORE SALTS LEFT BEHIND THROUGH EVAPORATION GETS HEAVIER
AN ELEMENT FATAL TO MAN THEY SAY BUT VITAL TO MYRIADS OF ANIMALS AND TO ME
THE COTTAGE SEEMED TO BE CONSIDERED AND LOVED BY HIM AS HIS HOME
THEN HIS OPERATIONS FINISHED HE WENT AND LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE BEACON HOUSING HIS EYES STRAYING OVER THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN MEANWHILE SOME TWENTY OF THE NAUTILUS'S SAILORS ALL ENERGETIC WELL BUILT FELLOWS CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM
YOU WILL HEREAFTER FIND YOUR OWN HOUSE AS FAULTLESS AS YOU NOW DO THIS THERE CERTAINLY ARE CIRCUMSTANCES SAID WILLOUGHBY
THE SERVANTS OF THE STOMACH AND SAVORING ITS INGENIOUS TEACHINGS WHEN CONSEIL INTERRUPTED MY READING WOULD MASTER KINDLY COME HERE FOR AN INSTANT HE SAID TO ME IN AN ODD VOICE WHAT IS IT CONSEIL
SHE COULD NOT ACCOUNT AND IT WAS SO WHOLLY CONTRADICTORY TO THEIR GENERAL OPINIONS AND PRACTICE THAT A DOUBT SOMETIMES ENTERED HER MIND OF THEIR BEING REALLY ENGAGED AND THIS DOUBT WAS ENOUGH TO PREVENT HER MAKING ANY INQUIRY OF MARIANNE
ON NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTH AT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE NAUTILUS CLEARED THE TROPIC OF CANCER AT LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO DEGREES ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH IT PASSED IN SIGHT OF THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS WHERE THE FAMOUS CAPTAIN COOK MET HIS DEATH
BRINGS ABOUT A CONSTANT INTERCHANGE OF TROPICAL AND POLAR WATERS WHAT'S MORE I'VE DETECTED THOSE FALLING AND RISING CURRENTS THAT MAKE UP THE OCEAN'S TRUE BREATHING I'VE SEEN A MOLECULE OF SALT WATER HEAT UP AT THE SURFACE
THIS SAID CAPTAIN NEMO HEADED TO THE HATCH AND DISAPPEARED DOWN THE LADDER
BUT THIS PLACE WILL ALWAYS HAVE ONE CLAIM OF MY AFFECTION WHICH NO OTHER CAN POSSIBLY SHARE MISSUS DASHWOOD LOOKED WITH PLEASURE AT MARIANNE WHOSE FINE EYES WERE FIXED SO EXPRESSIVELY ON WILLOUGHBY AS PLAINLY DENOTED HOW WELL SHE UNDERSTOOD HIM
WHERE LASHED WITH ROPES TO PREVENT THEIR BEING WASHED OVERBOARD SOME HUMAN CORPSES STILL LAY I COUNTED FOUR OF THEM FOUR MEN ONE STILL STANDING AT THE HELM THEN A WOMAN HALFWAY OUT OF A SKYLIGHT ON THE AFTERDECK
HOW LITTLE DID I THEN THINK THAT THE VERY FIRST NEWS I SHOULD HEAR FROM MISSUS SMITH WHEN I NEXT CAME INTO THE COUNTRY WOULD BE THAT BARTON COTTAGE WAS TAKEN AND I FELT AN IMMEDIATE SATISFACTION AND INTEREST IN THE EVENT
CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE SUDDEN TERMINATION OF COLONEL BRANDON'S VISIT AT THE PARK WITH HIS STEADINESS IN CONCEALING ITS CAUSE FILLED THE MIND AND RAISED THE WONDER OF MISSUS JENNINGS FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS SHE WAS A GREAT WONDERER
A SORRY SIGHT THIS CARCASS LOST UNDER THE WAVES
AT THE SIDE OF MARIANNE AND BY HIS FAVOURITE POINTER AT HER FEET ONE EVENING IN PARTICULAR ABOUT A WEEK AFTER COLONEL BRANDON LEFT THE COUNTRY HIS HEART SEEMED MORE THAN USUALLY OPEN
ALMOST EVERY DAY THE PANELS IN THE LOUNGE WERE OPEN FOR SOME HOURS AND OUR EYES NEVER TIRED OF PROBING THE MYSTERIES OF THE UNDERWATER WORLD THE NAUTILUS'S GENERAL HEADING WAS SOUTHEAST
LOOK AT THIS OCEAN PROFESSOR
YOU'D CREATE A MASS MEASURING FOUR MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUBIC LEAGUES WHICH IF IT WERE SPREAD ALL OVER THE GLOBE WOULD FORM A LAYER MORE THAN TEN METERS HIGH AND DON'T THINK THAT THE PRESENCE OF THESE SALTS IS DUE MERELY TO SOME WHIM OF NATURE NO
NED LAND WAS NOT MISTAKEN WE WERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A SHIP WHOSE SEVERED SHROUDS STILL HUNG FROM THEIR CLASPS ITS HULL LOOKED IN GOOD CONDITION
FOR ALL THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE WORLD DEPEND UPON IT THAT WHATEVER UNEMPLOYED SUM MAY REMAIN WHEN I MAKE UP MY ACCOUNTS IN THE SPRING I WOULD EVEN RATHER LAY IT USELESSLY BY THAN DISPOSE OF IT IN A MANNER SO PAINFUL TO YOU
THERE HE ADDED OUT THERE LIES TRUE EXISTENCE AND I CAN IMAGINE THE FOUNDING OF NAUTICAL TOWNS CLUSTERS OF UNDERWATER HOUSEHOLDS THAT LIKE THE NAUTILUS
AND BUILD IT UP AGAIN IN THE EXACT PLAN OF THIS COTTAGE WITH DARK NARROW STAIRS AND A KITCHEN THAT SMOKES I SUPPOSE SAID ELINOR YES CRIED HE IN THE SAME EAGER TONE WITH ALL AND EVERY THING BELONGING TO IT
HUNG SUSPENDED IN THE MIDST OF THE WATERS I OBSERVED IT CAREFULLY TRYING TO FIND OUT THE NATURE OF THIS GIGANTIC CETACEAN THEN A SUDDEN THOUGHT CROSSED MY MIND A SHIP I EXCLAIMED YES THE CANADIAN REPLIED A DISABLED CRAFT THAT'S SINKING STRAIGHT DOWN
THE STUMPS OF THREE MASTS CHOPPED OFF TWO FEET ABOVE THE DECK INDICATED A FLOODING SHIP THAT HAD BEEN FORCED TO SACRIFICE ITS MASTING
THE NAUTILUS WAS MOTIONLESS ITS BALLAST TANKS FULL IT WAS SITTING AT A DEPTH OF ONE THOUSAND METERS IN A COMPARATIVELY UNPOPULATED REGION OF THE OCEAN WHERE ONLY LARGER FISH PUT IN OCCASIONAL APPEARANCES JUST THEN I WAS STUDYING A DELIGHTFUL BOOK
TELL ME THAT NOT ONLY YOUR HOUSE WILL REMAIN THE SAME BUT THAT I SHALL EVER FIND YOU AND YOURS AS UNCHANGED AS YOUR DWELLING AND THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS CONSIDER ME WITH THE KINDNESS WHICH HAS MADE EVERYTHING BELONGING TO YOU SO DEAR TO ME THE PROMISE WAS READILY GIVEN
OUR SENTIMENTS OUR EMOTIONS AND OUR PASSIONS IT IS UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED THAT THESE STATES ARE OF A MENTAL NATURE
IN REGARD TO JUSTICE THE SOVEREIGN GOOD
AS WE DO OUR INDIFFERENT SENSATIONS THE SENSATIONS OF WEIGHT
ZADIG'S ANSWERS STILL CARRIED THE GREATEST WEIGHT WHAT PITY TIS SAID SOME WHO WERE PRESENT THAT ONE OF SO COMPREHENSIVE A GENIUS SHOULD MAKE SUCH A SCURVY CAVALIER MOST ILLUSTRIOUS GRANDEES
HE DID NOT DOUBT BUT BEING PROPERLY ACCOUTRED WITH HIS HELMET HIS CUIRASS AND HIS BRACELETS HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HUE DOWN AN ANTAGONIST IN HIS MANTLE AND CAP AND NOTHING TO SKREEN HIM FROM HIS RESENTMENT BUT A SINGLE SABRE
AND WAS HIS FAVOURITE MINISTER AT COURT AS THE JUST REWARD OF HIS PAST SERVICES HE WAS IN SHORT THE KING'S REAL FRIEND AND ZADIG WAS THE ONLY MONARCH IN THE UNIVERSE THAT COULD BOAST OF SUCH AN ATTENDANT
THIS THEORY HAS AT LEAST THE MERIT OF ORIGINALITY IT ALSO PLEASES ONE BY ITS GREAT CLEARNESS
TO BE CONSCIOUS OF AN EFFORT WOULD THEN BE NOTHING ELSE THAN TO RECEIVE ALL THESE CENTRIPETAL SENSATIONS AND WHAT PROVES THIS IS THAT THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EFFORT WHEN MOST CLEARLY MANIFESTED IS ACCOMPANIED BY SOME MUSCULAR ENERGY
NOTHING PASSES SO SLOWLY AS TIME TO HIM WHO IS IN EXPECTATION AND NOTHING SO SWIFT AS TIME TO HIM WHO IS IN THE PERFECT ENJOYMENT OF HIS WISHES IT'S EXTENT IS TO INFINITY IN THE WHOLE
UPON HIS FORT AS THE SWORDS MEN CALL IT BY WHICH MEANS ITOBAD'S SWORD WAS SNAPT IN TWO WITH THAT ZADIG IN AN INSTANT CLOS'D HIS ADVERSARY AND BY HIS SUPERIOR STRENGTH AS WELL AS SKILL
ARE THE MATTER THE MODE IN WHICH THEY ARE CONNECTED IN THE OBJECT THE FORM IN RESPECT TO THINGS IN GENERAL UNLIMITED REALITY WAS REGARDED AS THE MATTER OF ALL POSSIBILITY THE LIMITATION THEREOF NEGATION AS THE FORM
ALL IN GENERAL WERE LAVISH OF THEIR PRAISES AND IN THEIR HEARTS WISH'D HIM THEIR SOVEREIGN EXCEPT THE ENVIOUS MAN WHO AS HE PASS'D BY FETCH'D A DEEP SIGH AND TURN'D HIS HEAD ASIDE THE POPULACE
OPPOSITION BETWEEN REALITIES IS INCOGITABLE SUCH A RELATION THAT IS
IN AN OBJECT OF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING ONLY THAT IS INTERNAL WHICH HAS NO RELATION AS REGARDS ITS EXISTENCE TO ANYTHING DIFFERENT FROM ITSELF ON THE OTHER HAND THE INTERNAL DETERMINATIONS OF A SUBSTANTIA PHAENOMENON IN SPACE
THE FIRST AND TRADITIONAL ONE CONSISTS IN SEEING IN EMOTION A PHENOMENON SUI GENERIS THIS IS VERY SIMPLE AND LEAVES NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID
SOFTEN'D THE RIGOUR OF THE SENTENCE AND TOOK THE MONEY ONLY IN FULL OF ALL ACCOUNTS HE DIDN'T LEAVE SO MUCH AS SEMIRA WHOLLY DISCONSOLATE THO SHE HAD SUCH AN AVERSION TO A BLIND EYE NOR AZORA
IF A GENERAL JUDGEMENT IS TO BE CONSTRUCTED OR DIFFERENCE IF A PARTICULAR WHETHER THERE IS AGREEMENT WHEN AFFIRMATIVE AND OPPOSITION WHEN NEGATIVE JUDGEMENTS ARE TO BE CONSTRUCTED AND SO ON FOR THIS REASON WE OUGHT TO CALL THESE CONCEPTIONS
WHICH APPLIES TO THE OBJECTS THEMSELVES CONTAINS THE GROUND OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OBJECTIVE COMPARISON OF REPRESENTATIONS WITH EACH OTHER AND IS THEREFORE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE FORMER BECAUSE THE FACULTIES OF COGNITION TO WHICH THEY BELONG ARE NOT EVEN THE SAME
IT EXISTS IN ALL DOCTRINES IN WHICH THE CHARACTERISTIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOUGHT AND FEELING IS EXPUNGED AND FEELING IS BROUGHT BACK TO THOUGHT
CONSEQUENTLY AS INTELLIGIBILIA THAT IS OBJECTS OF PURE UNDERSTANDING ALTHOUGH ON ACCOUNT OF THE CONFUSED NATURE OF THEIR REPRESENTATIONS HE GAVE THEM THE NAME OF PHENOMENA AND IN THIS CASE HIS PRINCIPLE OF THE INDISCERNIBLE
THEY ANNIHILATE THE EFFECTS OF EACH OTHER AND MAY BE REPRESENTED IN THE FORMULA
OF THE EQUIVOCAL NATURE OR AMPHIBOLY OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF REFLECTION FROM THE CONFUSION OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL WITH THE EMPIRICAL USE OF THE UNDERSTANDING REFLECTION REFLEXIO IS NOT OCCUPIED ABOUT OBJECTS THEMSELVES
AND DETERMINE THEIR POSSIBILITY AN OBJECTION PERFECTLY CORRECT IF WE ASSUME THAT WE INTUITE THINGS AS THEY ARE ALTHOUGH WITH CONFUSED REPRESENTATION
BOTH IN A TRANSCENDENTAL SENSE ABSTRACTION BEING MADE OF EVERY DIFFERENCE IN THAT WHICH IS GIVEN AND OF THE MODE IN WHICH IT IS DETERMINED LOGICIANS FORMERLY TERMED THE UNIVERSAL MATTER THE SPECIFIC DIFFERENCE OF THIS OR THAT PART OF THE UNIVERSAL FORM
THAT IS OF THEIR REPRESENTATIONS HENCE WITH HIM SPACE AND TIME WERE POSSIBLE
IS LIKEWISE AN INTELLECTUALIST SYSTEM THE DEFINITION OF EMOTION AS IT IS TAUGHT BY W JAMES SEEMS EXPRESSLY MADE FOR US WHO ARE SEEKING TO RESOLVE ALL INTELLECTUAL STATES INTO PHYSICAL IMPRESSIONS ACCOMPANIED BY CONSCIOUSNESS
THESE DERANGEMENTS ARE THE BASIS OF EMOTION ITS PHYSICAL BASIS AND TO BE MOVED IS TO PERCEIVE THEM TAKE AWAY FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS THIS PHYSICAL REFLEX AND EMOTION CEASES IT IS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT AN IDEA
BY THE SIDE OF EMOTION WE MAY PLACE AS DEMANDING THE SAME ANALYTICAL STUDY THE FEELING OF EFFORT WE OUGHT TO INQUIRE WITH EFFORT AS HAS BEEN DONE WITH EMOTION WHAT IS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL NATURE OF THIS PHENOMENON
UNDER THE FORM OF TACTILE MUSCULAR THERMAL AND OTHER SENSATIONS UNTIL NOW THIS CATEGORY OF PHENOMENA HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT NEGLECTED BECAUSE WE SAW IN IT EFFECTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF WHICH THE ROLE IN EMOTION ITSELF SEEMED SLIGHT
BUT ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BE IN THIS RESPECT PERFECTLY THE SAME
OF HIS POMPOUS HELMET HIS SUPERB CUIRASS HIS RICH BRACELETS HIS BRILLIANT CUISSES OR ARMOUR FOR HIS THIGHS AND OTHER MARTIAL ACCOUTREMENTS WHEN ZADIG HAD EQUIPP'D HIMSELF CAP A PEE IN HIS NOW RECOVER'D ARMOUR
AT LENGTH A SINGLE HORSE CHAISE WAS SEEN MAKING ITS WAY CAREFULLY AMONG THE STONES WHICH LAY SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY ROAD THAT WOUND THROUGH THE VALLEY AND APPROACHED THE COTTAGE
AND POSSIBLY DREAMING THAT THESE LITTLE FEMININE OFFICES WERE PERFORMED FOR ANOTHER HER NATURAL BLOOM WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE INSINUATION OF THE SURGEON NOR WAS THE LUSTER OF HER EYE IN ANY DEGREE DIMINISHED THE SOUND OF THE APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS OF SITGREAVES HASTENED HER RETREAT DOWN A PRIVATE STAIRWAY TO THE SIDE OF HER SISTER
HIS LOOK WAS CHANGED TO THE FACE OF FRANCES WHO STARTLED BY THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS EXPRESSION AROSE AND HASTILY INQUIRED IF HE WOULD HAVE ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU CAN PARDON THE RUDENESS SAID THE WOUNDED OFFICER MAKING A FEEBLE EFFORT TO RAISE HIS BODY I WOULD REQUEST TO HAVE CAPTAIN LAWTON'S COMPANY FOR A MOMENT
HIS PATIENT SMILED AS HE GENTLY REPULSED HIS PHYSICIAN IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNDO THE BANDAGES AND WITH A RETURNING GLOW TO HIS CHEEKS INQUIRED
HE ANSWERED THE APPLICANT WITH A GOOD NATURED SMILE I JUDGE NOT IF DEATH HAS ANTICIPATED YOUR NUPTIALS I AM FEARFUL YOU HAVE NO REMEDY AGAINST HIS STERN DECREES TO KATY THIS SOUNDED WELL ALTHOUGH SHE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING OF ITS MEANING BUT DEATH AND NUPTIALS
STILL FRANCES COULD WITH DIFFICULTY WITHDRAW HER TRUANT EYES FROM THE COUNTENANCE OF THEIR VISITOR SHE WAS YOUNG AND OF A LIGHT AND FRAGILE FORM BUT OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS HER EYES WERE LARGE FULL BLACK PIERCING AND AT TIMES A LITTLE WILD HER HAIR WAS LUXURIANT
THAT SEEMED SO OVERWHELMING A NEARER VIEW OF THE DISTURBED FEATURES OF THE VISITOR CONFIRMED MISS PEYTON IN HER BELIEF AND WITH THE SHOCK THAT GENTLE FEELINGS EVER EXPERIENCE AT A SUDDEN AND ENDLESS SEPARATION FROM EVEN THE MEANEST OF THEIR ASSOCIATES SHE SAID HASTILY
THEY WERE REPULSED YOU SAW IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO DRIVE US FROM THE WOOD AT LEAST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY MADE AN ATTACK SAID THE CAPTAIN THROWING THE REST OF HIS CLOTHES WITHIN REACH OF THE COLONEL
IT WAS THROWN OPEN BY A DRAGOON WHO FOLLOWED THE CARRIAGE AND WHO HAD BEEN THE MESSENGER DISPATCHED BY DUNWOODIE TO THE FATHER OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON MISS PEYTON ADVANCED TO RECEIVE THEIR GUEST AND THE SISTERS UNITED IN GIVING HER THE KINDEST WELCOME
HAD WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEW GOOD FIRES UPON THEM IN FLANK WE SHOULD HAVE SENT THESE BRAVE VIRGINIANS TO THE RIGHT ABOUT AYE AND THAT IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME CRIED THE COLONEL MAKING THE OTHER LEG FOLLOW ITS COMPANION THEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO ROUT THE GUIDES YOU KNOW AND THE MOVEMENT GAVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE
WHEN THE GAZER TURNED HIS EYES FROM THE VIEW IN DISAPPOINTMENT HE SEEMED BEWILDERED RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN AWAKING FROM A DREAM AND MUSED WHERE IS DUNWOODIE ISABELLA HE SAID THE EXCELLENT FELLOW IS NEVER WEARY OF KIND ACTIONS AFTER A DAY OF SUCH SERVICE AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
IN SHORT WHARTON SAID THE COLONEL PUTTING ONE LEG OUT OF BED IT MAY BE CALLED A COMBINATION OF UNTOWARD EVENTS YOUR OWN UNGOVERNABLE HORSE PREVENTED MY ORDERS FROM BEING CARRIED TO THE MAJOR IN SEASON TO FLANK THE REBELS VERY TRUE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN KICKING A SLIPPER TOWARDS THE BED
AND THOSE HE HAS ON ARE NONE OF THE BEST I CAN TELL YOU HOW EXCLAIMED THE OTHER ASTONISHED COULD ANYONE HAVE THE HEART TO PLUNDER A MAN IN SUCH DISTRESS HEARTS REPEATED KATY CATCHING HER BREATH MEN LIKE THEM HAVE NO BOWELS AT ALL PLUNDER AND DISTRESS INDEED
INDEED I CAN EASILY COMPREHEND THE MORTIFICATION YOU MUST HAVE FELT IN HAVING ONE SO SELF WILLED TO DEAL WITH RETURNED THE SURGEON GLANCING HIS EYES REPROACHFULLY AT HIS COMRADE BUT YOU SHOULD RISE SUPERIOR TO SUCH OPINIONS AND PITY THE IGNORANCE BY WHICH THEY ARE ENGENDERED
BUT THEN I HAVE LEFT MY WAGES FOR THREE YEARS PAST IN THE HANDS OF HARVEY AND HOW AM I TO GET THEM MY BROTHERS TOLD ME AGAIN AND AGAIN TO ASK FOR MY MONEY BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT ACCOUNTS BETWEEN RELATIONS WERE EASILY SETTLED WERE YOU RELATED THEN TO BIRCH ASKED MISS PEYTON OBSERVING HER TO PAUSE
THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR SITGREAVES WHO IN SOME ALARM NOTICED THE INCREASE OF FEVERISH SYMPTOMS IN HIS PATIENT ENFORCED THIS MANDATE AND THE TROOPER WITHDREW TO PAY A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE TO ROANOKE WHO HAD BEEN AN EQUAL SUFFERER WITH HIMSELF IN THEIR LAST NIGHT'S SOMERSAULT
FRANCES HAD STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE ACTION AND FACE OF ISABELLA WITH A KIND OF UNEASY ADMIRATION BUT SHE NOW SPRANG TO HER SIDE WITH THE ARDOR OF A SISTER AND KINDLY DRAWING HER ARM WITHIN HER OWN LED THE WAY TO A RETIRED ROOM
FRANCES HASTENED INSTANTLY TO COMMUNICATE HIS WISH TO THAT GENTLEMAN AND IMPELLED BY AN INTEREST SHE COULD NOT CONTROL SHE RETURNED AGAIN TO HER SEAT BY THE SIDE OF MISS SINGLETON LAWTON SAID THE YOUTH IMPATIENTLY AS THE TROOPER ENTERED HEAR YOU FROM THE MAJOR
IT WAS ALWAYS SAID OF ME THAT I WANTED NOTHING BUT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE QUITE A PHYSICIAN MYSELF SO LONG AS BEFORE I CAME TO LIVE WITH HARVEY'S FATHER THEY CALLED ME THE PETTICOAT DOCTOR MORE TRUE THAN CIVIL I DARE SAY RETURNED THE SURGEON LOSING SIGHT OF THE WOMAN'S CHARACTER IN HIS ADMIRATION OF HER RESPECT FOR THE HEALING ART
OH AUNT JEANETTE IS EXERTING HERSELF TO DO CREDIT TO MY FATHER'S HOSPITALITY SAID THE LAUGHING GIRL AND I AM A TRUANT FROM HER LABORS AS I SHALL BE A STRANGER TO HER FAVOR UNLESS I PROFFER MY ASSISTANCE
I'M SURE HARVEY HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH ALREADY FROM HAVING SO MUCH CONCERNS WITH THE RIG'LARS REPLIED THE HOUSEKEEPER HE HAS LOST HIS ALL AND MADE HIMSELF A VAGABOND THROUGH THE LAND AND I HAVE REASON TO RUE THE DAY I EVER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
THE COUNTENANCE OF KATY CHANGED FROM THE NATURAL EXPRESSION OF CONCERN TO THE SET FORM OF MELANCHOLY AS SHE ANSWERED HE IS HAPPILY REMOVED FROM THE CARES OF THE WORLD THE CHINKING OF THE MONEY MADE HIM GET OUT OF HIS BED AND THE POOR SOUL FOUND THE SHOCK TOO GREAT FOR HIM
THEREIN YOU SHOW YOUR SENSE SAID THE SURGEON APPROACHING THE SPINSTER WHO SAT HOLDING THE PALMS OF HER HANDS AND THE SOLES OF HER FEET TO THE GENIAL HEAT OF A FINE FIRE MAKING THE MOST OF COMFORT AMID ALL HER TROUBLES
THE FEELING WAS COMMUNICATED TO ALL THE SPECTATORS AND THEY DISPERSED IN PURSUIT OF THEIR USUAL AVOCATIONS ISABELLA YIELDED TO THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF FRANCES WITHOUT RESISTANCE
DOCTOR SITGREAVES DOES NOT MEAN A RIG'LAR SOLDIER BUT A REGULAR PHYSICIAN MADAM SAID THE TROOPER OH CRIED THE MAIDEN AGAIN CORRECTING HERSELF FOR THE BEST OF ALL REASONS THERE WAS NONE TO BE HAD SO I TOOK CARE OF HIM MYSELF
A BROTHER WOUNDED AND A PRISONER AND PERHAPS A VICTIM YOUR FATHER DISTRESSED HIS PRIVACY INTERRUPTED AND NOT IMPROBABLY HIS ESTATES TORN FROM HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LOYALTY TO HIS KING FRANCES CONTINUED HER WALK IN SILENCE WHILE FACING THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE TO THE VALE
IF ANYONE INTERFERES WITH MY PATIENTS CRIED THE DOCTOR HASTILY I WILL TEACH THEM SPIRIT OR NO SPIRIT WHAT IT IS TO MEDDLE WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CONCERNS TUT MY DEAR FELLOW THERE WAS NO INTERFERENCE MADE NOR ANY INTENDED SEE EXHIBITING THE BANDAGES
IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR A MAN TO GET A WIFE AT ALL IN SUCH A PREDICARY DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD MISS PEYTON I SELDOM TROUBLE MYSELF WITH SUCH THINGS SAID THE LADY GRAVELY DURING THIS DIALOGUE CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN STUDYING THE COUNTENANCE AND MANNER OF THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH A MOST LUDICROUS GRAVITY
WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
THE THARKS WERE HAVING THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
WHEN I SAW TARS TARKAS SURGING THROUGH THE CROWD OF PYGMIES THAT SWARMED ABOUT HIM WITH ONE SWING OF HIS MIGHTY LONGSWORD HE LAID A DOZEN CORPSES AT HIS FEET
AGAINST THE IRON MUSCLES AND BRUTAL FEROCITY OF THIS ENRAGED DENIZEN OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD IN FACT THE ONLY OUTCOME OF SUCH AN ENCOUNTER SO FAR AS I MIGHT BE CONCERNED SEEMED SUDDEN DEATH
RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
SO I MERELY THREW IT AS HEAVILY AS I COULD AT HIS ADVANCING BULK IT STRUCK HIM JUST BELOW THE KNEES ELICITING A HOWL OF PAIN AND RAGE AND SO THROWING HIM OFF HIS BALANCE THAT HE LUNGED FULL UPON ME
WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
BACKED BY MUSCLES FAR TRANSCENDING THOSE OF THE MARTIAN MEN I HAD SEEN HAD LOCKED THE THROAT OF MY GUARDIAN AND SLOWLY WERE CHOKING OUT HIS LIFE AND BENDING BACK HIS HEAD AND NECK UPON HIS BODY
FOR IT WAS SAB THAN PRINCE OF ZODANGA WHO STOOD REVEALED BEFORE ME THAN KOSIS NOW TOOK A SET OF THE ORNAMENTS FROM ONE OF THE SALVERS AND PLACED ONE OF THE COLLARS OF GOLD ABOUT HIS SON'S NECK
TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES FOR GAINING A POSITION
BAR COMAS HAD MUCH THE BETTER OF THE BATTLE AS HE WAS STRONGER QUICKER AND MORE INTELLIGENT IT SOON SEEMED THAT THE ENCOUNTER WAS DONE SAVING ONLY THE FINAL DEATH THRUST WHEN BAR COMAS SLIPPED IN
THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
FOOD WAS BROUGHT ME AT INTERVALS BUT OWING TO THE UTTER DARKNESS OF THE PLACE I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER I LAY THERE DAYS OR WEEKS OR MONTHS IT WAS THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OF ALL MY LIFE
THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
WHERE I MOMENTARILY EXPECTED THE FORMER TO FALL LIMP AT THE END OF A BROKEN NECK IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS THE APE WAS TEARING AWAY THE ENTIRE FRONT OF ITS BREAST WHICH WAS HELD IN THE VISE LIKE GRIP OF THE POWERFUL JAWS
ALTHOUGH I AT FIRST BOMBARDED HIM WITH QUESTIONS FINALLY ALL THE HATRED AND MANIACAL LOATHING FOR THESE AWFUL CREATURES WHO HAD PLACED ME IN THIS HORRIBLE PLACE WAS CENTERED BY MY TOTTERING REASON UPON THIS SINGLE EMISSARY
SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL
LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
LOVE OR AFFECTION THESE PEOPLE FAIRLY WORSHIP PHYSICAL PROWESS AND BRAVERY AND NOTHING IS TOO GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF THEIR ADORATION AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS HIS POSITION BY REPEATED EXAMPLES OF HIS SKILL
BATTLE AS IT IS VOUCHSAFED FEW BEINGS TO SEE THE STRENGTH AGILITY AND BLIND FEROCITY OF THESE TWO CREATURES IS APPROACHED BY NOTHING KNOWN TO EARTHLY MAN
BAR COMAS WAS STONE DEAD AND ONLY THE MOST HERCULEAN EFFORTS ON THE PART OF DAK KOVA'S FEMALES SAVED HIM FROM THE FATE HE DESERVED THREE DAYS LATER HE WALKED WITHOUT ASSISTANCE TO THE BODY OF BAR COMAS WHICH
EVIL LOOKING PISTOL FROM ITS HOLSTER AND WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING AN END TO THE CREATURE WHEN I SPRANG FORWARD AND STRUCK UP HIS ARM THE BULLET STRIKING THE WOODEN CASING OF THE WINDOW EXPLODED
BACK INTO MY CORNER I CROUCHED
DEATH STRUGGLE WITH MY PRESERVER WHICH WAS NOTHING LESS THAN MY FAITHFUL WATCH THING I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO CALL SO HIDEOUS A CREATURE A DOG AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I GAINED MY FEET AND BACKING AGAINST THE WALL I WITNESSED SUCH A
AND THAT MY MIND DID NOT GIVE WAY TO THE TERRORS OF THAT INKY BLACKNESS HAS BEEN A WONDER TO ME EVER SINCE THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH CREEPING CRAWLING THINGS COLD SINUOUS BODIES PASSED OVER ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
NO LONGER WAS I A JIBBERING IDIOT BUT A SANE REASONING MAN WITH THE MEANS OF ESCAPE WITHIN MY VERY HANDS AS I WAS GROPING TO REMOVE THE CHAIN FROM ABOUT MY VICTIM'S NECK
HELD IN ITS POOR UGLY CARCASS MORE LOVE MORE LOYALTY MORE GRATITUDE
AND DEPENDING FROM THESE A NUMBER OF DRIED HUMAN HANDS HIS REFERENCE TO THE GREAT GAMES OF WHICH I HAD HEARD SO MUCH WHILE AMONG THE THARKS CONVINCED ME THAT I HAD BUT JUMPED FROM PURGATORY INTO GEHENNA
TO THIS CHANGE BUT THOUGH SPECULATIVE MEN MIGHT EVEN IN THAT AGE DISCERN THE VICES OF THE OLD REPRESENTATIVE SYSTEM AND PREDICT THAT THOSE VICES WOULD SOONER OR LATER PRODUCE SERIOUS PRACTICAL EVIL
BY RATIFYING THAT LAW HE BOUND HIMSELF NEVER AGAIN TO RAISE MONEY WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE HOUSES
AND HEARD WITHIN THEM HOW THE HUMAN HEART BEAT
BUT HAD MANY REASONS FOR DREADING THE RESTORATION OF THE OLD FAMILY RICHARD WAS THE VERY MAN FOR POLITICIANS OF THIS DESCRIPTION
FOR THESE THINGS HISTORY MUST HOLD THE KING HIMSELF CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE FROM THE TIME OF HIS THIRD PARLIAMENT HE WAS HIS OWN PRIME MINISTER
OUT THERE IN THE MIDST OF THE SNOW THERE SAT A WOMAN IN LONG BLACK CLOTHES AND SHE SAID DEATH HAS BEEN IN THY CHAMBER AND I SAW HIM HASTEN AWAY WITH THY LITTLE CHILD
WITH ALMOST BOUNDLESS POWER OVER THE NORTHERN COUNTIES ALL THESE TRIBUNALS INSULTED AND DEFIED THE AUTHORITY OF WESTMINSTER HALL AND DAILY COMMITTED EXCESSES WHICH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED ROYALISTS HAVE WARMLY CONDEMNED
WITH SENATES APPOINTED BY LOT WITH ANNUAL SENATES WITH PERPETUAL SENATES IN THESE PLANS NOTHING WAS OMITTED ALL THE DETAIL ALL THE NOMENCLATURE ALL THE CEREMONIAL OF THE IMAGINARY GOVERNMENT WAS FULLY SET FORTH POLEMARCHS AND PHYLARCHS
TAKEN THE SIDE OF PUBLIC LIBERTY TO SIT IN THE UPPER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT WITHOUT ANY NEW CREATION THUS FAR THE STATESMEN BY WHOSE ADVICE RICHARD ACTED HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL
AND WAS MUCH MORE DISPOSED THAN HIS FATHER TO CARRY THEM INTO PRACTICE HE WAS LIKE HIS FATHER A ZEALOUS EPISCOPALIAN HE WAS MOREOVER WHAT HIS FATHER HAD NEVER BEEN A ZEALOUS ARMINIAN
THEY WERE AS WELL BORN AS HE AND AS WELL EDUCATED THEY COULD NOT UNDERSTAND
COULD WADE THROUGH IT AND ACROSS IT SHE MUST GO IF SHE WOULD FIND HER CHILD THEN SHE LAY DOWN TO DRINK UP THE LAKE AND THAT WAS AN IMPOSSIBILITY FOR A HUMAN BEING BUT THE AFFLICTED MOTHER THOUGHT THAT A MIRACLE MIGHT HAPPEN NEVERTHELESS
IT WAS PLAYED ON THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WITH KEENNESS BUT WITH ADMIRABLE DEXTERITY COOLNESS AND PERSEVERANCE GREAT STATESMEN WHO LOOKED FAR BEHIND THEM AND FAR BEFORE THEM WERE AT THE HEAD OF THAT ASSEMBLY
BUT YET MANY MORE TEARS AND THEN NIGHT SAID GO TO THE RIGHT INTO THE DARK PINE FOREST THITHER I SAW DEATH TAKE HIS WAY WITH THY LITTLE CHILD
THAT PARTY HAD ALWAYS BEEN DESIROUS TO SEE THE OLD CIVIL POLITY
WAS THE COUNSELLOR MOST TRUSTED IN POLITICAL AND MILITARY AFFAIRS
IT BECAME MANIFEST THAT CHARLES HAD NO INTENTION OF OBSERVING THE COMPACT INTO WHICH HE HAD ENTERED THE SUPPLY GIVEN BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION WAS COLLECTED
AND TO PUNISH WITH MERCILESS RIGOUR ALL WHO MURMURED AT THE ACTS OF THE GOVERNMENT
THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FIRST MAGISTRATE AND NO HOUSE OF LORDS BUT THIS STATE OF THINGS COULD NOT LAST ON THE
NAMED BY THE OFFICERS ASSUMED THE DIRECTION OF AFFAIRS
TOUCH THEM NOT SAID DEATH
EITHER TO MONARCHY OR TO LIBERTY THAT MIGHTY FORCE WHICH HAD DURING MANY YEARS ACTED AS ONE MAN AND WHICH WHILE SO ACTING HAD BEEN FOUND IRRESISTIBLE WAS AT LENGTH DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF
IT SEEMED THAT THE INDEPENDENTS WERE TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE PRESBYTERIANS AND THAT THE MEN OF THE SWORD WERE TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE MEN OF THE GOWN A COALITION
WITH THE EXACTNESS OF A PROFESSOR BUT AFTER THE FASHION OF INTELLIGENT AND WELL EDUCATED GENTLEMEN HIS TASTE IN LITERATURE AND ART WAS EXCELLENT HIS MANNER DIGNIFIED THOUGH NOT GRACIOUS HIS DOMESTIC LIFE WITHOUT BLEMISH
EVERY TREE AND EVERY FLOWER HAD ITS NAME EACH OF THEM WAS A HUMAN LIFE THE HUMAN FRAME STILL LIVED ONE IN CHINA AND ANOTHER IN GREENLAND ROUND ABOUT IN THE WORLD
BUT DESTITUTE OF THE WISDOM AND CIVIL COURAGE WHICH HAD BEEN CONSPICUOUS IN THEIR DECEASED LEADER SOME OF THEM WERE HONEST BUT FANATICAL INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS OF THIS CLASS FLEETWOOD WAS THE REPRESENTATIVE
SUCH WAS THE END WHICH CHARLES DISTINCTLY PROPOSED TO HIMSELF FROM MARCH SIXTEEN TWENTY NINE TO APRIL SIXTEEN FORTY THE HOUSES WERE NOT CONVOKED
AND FELT TOWARDS THOSE WHOM HE HAD DESERTED THAT PECULIAR MALIGNITY WHICH HAS IN ALL AGES BEEN CHARACTERISTIC OF APOSTATES
WHICH IS THE BEST HEAR ME NOT HEAR ME NOT
SOME OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS WERE IMPRISONED AND ONE OF THEM SIR JOHN ELIOT AFTER YEARS OF SUFFERING DIED IN CONFINEMENT CHARLES HOWEVER COULD NOT VENTURE TO RAISE BY HIS OWN AUTHORITY
THOU CANST NOT DO ANYTHING AGAINST ME SAID DEATH BUT OUR LORD CAN SAID SHE I ONLY DO HIS BIDDING SAID DEATH I AM HIS GARDENER
IT WAS SO PALE THE SMALL EYES HAD CLOSED THEMSELVES AND IT DREW ITS BREATH SO SOFTLY NOW AND THEN WITH A DEEP RESPIRATION AS IF IT SIGHED AND THE MOTHER LOOKED STILL MORE SORROWFULLY ON THE LITTLE CREATURE
AND DISTRESS HORROR AND WRETCHEDNESS BOTH OF THEM ARE GOD'S WILL SAID DEATH WHICH OF THEM IS MISFORTUNE'S FLOWER AND WHICH IS THAT OF HAPPINESS ASKED SHE
TAKE THEM AGAIN THEY ARE NOW BRIGHTER THAN BEFORE NOW LOOK DOWN INTO THE DEEP WELL CLOSE BY I SHALL TELL THEE THE NAMES OF THE TWO FLOWERS
HE NOW DETERMINED ON A CHANGE OF TACTICS INSTEAD OF OPPOSING AN INFLEXIBLE RESISTANCE TO THE DEMANDS OF THE COMMONS HE AFTER MUCH ALTERCATION AND MANY EVASIONS AGREED TO A COMPROMISE WHICH IF HE HAD FAITHFULLY ADHERED TO IT
AND A LITTLE FURTHER ON WAS A TINY THATCHED COTTAGE OUT OF WHICH CAME THE YELLOW DWARF WITH A VERY JAUNTY AIR
AND KNEW IN A MOMENT THAT THIS MUST BE THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT FOR HER FEET WERE THE ONE THING SHE COULD NOT CHANGE HOWEVER PRETTY SHE MIGHT MAKE HER FACE WITHOUT SEEMING TO HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING HE SAID IN A CONFIDENTIAL WAY
AND MANY LITTLE BROOKS MURMURED SOFTLY UNDER THE SHADY TREES WHERE IT WAS ALWAYS COOL AND FRESH A LITTLE WAY OFF STOOD A SPLENDID PALACE THE WALLS OF WHICH WERE OF TRANSPARENT EMERALDS
AT LAST THE CHIEF MEN OF THE KINGDOM ANXIOUS TO SEE THEIR PRINCESS MARRIED SENT TO THE QUEEN TO BEG HER TO CHOOSE A HUSBAND FOR HER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SHE REPLIED THAT NOTHING WOULD PLEASE HER BETTER
THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES WAS NOT LESS NOBLE AND SPLENDID IT WAS EASY TO SEE BY HIS FACE HOW HAPPY HE WAS AND EVERYONE WHO WENT NEAR HIM RETURNED LOADED WITH PRESENTS
RASH YOUTH HE CRIED RUSHING BETWEEN THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT AND THE KING DARE TO LAY A FINGER UPON THIS ILLUSTRIOUS FAIRY YOUR QUARREL IS WITH ME ONLY I AM YOUR ENEMY AND YOUR RIVAL
WAS FEELING TERRIBLY SAD AT BEING SO RAPIDLY TORN AWAY FROM HIS BELOVED PRINCESS BUT HE KNEW TOO WELL HOW POWERFUL THE FAIRY WAS TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING FROM HER EXCEPT BY GREAT PATIENCE AND CUNNING
AND PERHAPS EVEN EMBARRASSED THE YELLOW DWARF HIMSELF BUT EVEN HIS COURAGE GAVE WAY WHEN HE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIS BELOVED PRINCESS FOR THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT LOOKING MORE TERRIBLE THAN BEFORE MOUNTED UPON A WINGED GRIFFIN
HER MOTHER WHO SINCE THE DEATH OF THE KING HER FATHER HAD NOTHING IN THE WORLD SHE CARED FOR SO MUCH AS THIS LITTLE PRINCESS WAS SO TERRIBLY AFRAID OF LOSING HER THAT SHE QUITE SPOILED HER
SHE FOUND TO HER GREAT SURPRISE THAT SHE WAS LYING IN HER OWN BED AT HOME AND WHAT WAS MORE THAT SHE HAD ON THE LOVELIEST LACE NIGHT CAP THAT SHE HAD EVER SEEN IN HER LIFE AT FIRST SHE THOUGHT THAT ALL HER ADVENTURES
BUT THAT HER DAUGHTER SEEMED SO UNWILLING TO MARRY AND SHE RECOMMENDED THEM TO GO AND TALK TO THE PRINCESS ABOUT IT THEMSELVES SO THIS THEY AT ONCE DID NOW BELLISSIMA WAS MUCH LESS PROUD SINCE HER ADVENTURE WITH THE YELLOW DWARF
TO SEEK OUT EVERYTHING RARE AND PRECIOUS TO ADORN THE PRINCESS ALTHOUGH HER BEAUTY WAS SO PERFECT THAT NOTHING SHE WORE COULD MAKE HER LOOK PRETTIER AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES THOUGHT AND HE WAS NEVER HAPPY UNLESS HE WAS WITH HER
AND I MUST TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY ALREADY YOU SEE IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO DO IF YOU REALLY CARE FOR ME
BUT THE QUEEN WHO DIDN'T WANT HER TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH ONLY SAID THAT SHE WAS ILL OR THAT ONE OF HER NEIGHBORS WAS THREATENING TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HER BELLISSIMA KNEW QUITE WELL THAT SOMETHING WAS BEING HIDDEN FROM HER
SHE WAS DRESSED ALMOST ALWAYS IN THE PRETTIEST FROCKS AS A FAIRY OR AS A QUEEN GOING OUT TO HUNT AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FOLLOWED HER DRESSED AS FOREST FAIRIES AND TO MAKE HER MORE VAIN THAN EVER
ALL THE KING'S UNSUCCESSFUL RIVALS HAD GONE HOME IN DESPAIR THEY SAID GOOD BY TO THE PRINCESS SO SADLY THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING SORRY FOR THEM AH MADAM THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES SAID TO HER
SO YOU MUST NOT GRUDGE THEM MY COMPASSION THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES WAS QUITE OVERCOME BY THE PRINCESS'S GOOD NATURED WAY OF TAKING HIS INTERFERENCE AND THROWING HIMSELF AT HER FEET HE KISSED HER HAND A THOUSAND TIMES
WITH THESE THISTLES AND NETTLES SHE CAN FEED A DONKEY WHICH SHE CAN RIDE WHENEVER SHE LIKES UNDER THIS HUMBLE ROOF NO WEATHER CAN HURT HER SHE WILL DRINK THE WATER OF THIS BROOK AND EAT FROGS WHICH GROW VERY FAT ABOUT HERE
BELLISSIMA SHALL MARRY YOU
DO YOU REALLY MEAN WHAT YOU SAY PRINCE SAID THE FAIRY QUITE DECEIVED SURELY REPLIED THE PRINCE HOW COULD I DECEIVE YOU YOU SEE IT IS SO MUCH MORE FLATTERING TO MY VANITY TO BE LOVED BY A FAIRY THAN BY A SIMPLE PRINCESS
DO WISH YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PROUD WHAT MAKES YOU DESPISE ALL THESE NICE KINGS I WISH YOU TO MARRY ONE OF THEM AND YOU DO NOT TRY TO PLEASE ME I AM SO HAPPY BELLISSIMA ANSWERED
THAT SHE COULD NEITHER EAT DRINK NOR SLEEP FOR THINKING OF IT THE PRINCESS WHO IN SPITE OF HER WILFULNESS REALLY LOVED HER MOTHER WITH ALL HER HEART WAS MUCH GRIEVED WHEN SHE SAW HER LOOKING SO SAD AND OFTEN ASKED HER WHAT WAS THE MATTER
BUT HAD NOT THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD EVER CARE ABOUT HIM AT ALL YOU CAN EASILY IMAGINE HOW DELIGHTED HE WAS WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS AND HOW ANGRY IT MADE ALL THE OTHER KINGS TO LOSE FOR EVER THE HOPE OF MARRYING THE PRINCESS BUT AFTER ALL
AND I SHALL BE VERY ANGRY IF YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH ANYONE WHO IS NOT WORTHY OF YOU BUT THE PRINCESS THOUGHT SO MUCH OF HERSELF THAT SHE DID NOT CONSIDER ANY ONE OF HER LOVERS CLEVER OR HANDSOME ENOUGH FOR HER
THE QUEEN YOUR MOTHER HAS PROMISED YOU IN MARRIAGE HAS PROMISED ME INTERRUPTED THE PRINCESS OH NO I'M SURE SHE HAS NOT
THE QUEEN AND THE PRINCESS WERE JUST READY TO SET OUT WITH THE KING WHEN THEY SAW ADVANCING TOWARD THEM FROM THE END OF THE LONG GALLERY TWO GREAT BASILISKS DRAGGING AFTER THEM A VERY BADLY MADE BOX
AT THAT MOMENT SHE HEARD THE ROARING OF THE GREAT LIONS WHO HAD FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS NEAR AND WERE COMING TO LOOK FOR HER
OR NOT SO WITH GREAT CARE SHE MADE SOME OF THE PROPER CAKE TO PACIFY THE LIONS
NO NO HE SAID I'LL BE BACK TO EM AGAIN BY A SHORT CUT THROUGH THE FIELDS
AND WAS SOON HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES LIZZIE WAS STANDING QUIETLY BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A FEW PACES OFF WITH HER BACK TO ME MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS SITTING EASILY WITH A LOOSE REIN
AND LEANING A LITTLE FORWARD WE DASHED AFTER THEM FOR ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF THE ROAD RAN STRAIGHT AND THEN BENT TO THE RIGHT AFTER WHICH IT DIVIDED INTO TWO ROADS
THE LADY ANNE OR A RUNAWAY HORSE EARLY IN THE SPRING LORD W AND PART OF HIS FAMILY WENT UP TO LONDON AND TOOK YORK WITH THEM
BUT THE KING'S SON SOON FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE AWOKE IN THE MORNING HE FOUND THAT THE PRINCESSES HAD ALL BEEN DANCING FOR THE SOLES OF THEIR SHOES WERE FULL OF HOLES THE SAME THING HAPPENED THE SECOND AND THIRD NIGHT SO THE KING
THEN HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN ON HIS BED AND IN A LITTLE WHILE
HE THEN SOMEHOW SCRAMBLED INTO THE SADDLE AND WITH A GEE UP AND A CLAP ON MY SIDES WITH BOTH HIS LEGS HE STARTED ON HIS JOURNEY MAKING A LITTLE CIRCUIT TO AVOID THE DIKE HE HAD NO WHIP WHICH SEEMED TO TROUBLE HIM
AS SOON AS YOU PUT THAT ON YOU WILL BECOME INVISIBLE AND YOU WILL THEN BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE PRINCESSES WHEREVER THEY GO
SOMETIMES WITH GINGER SOMETIMES WITH LIZZIE THIS LIZZIE WAS A BRIGHT BAY MARE ALMOST THOROUGHBRED AND A GREAT FAVORITE WITH THE GENTLEMEN ON ACCOUNT OF HER FINE ACTION AND LIVELY SPIRIT
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE STAIRS THE SOLDIER RAN ON BEFORE THE PRINCESSES AND LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND AS THE TWELVE SISTERS SLOWLY CAME UP VERY MUCH TIRED THEY HEARD HIM SNORING IN HIS BED SO THEY SAID
BUT GINGER WHO KNEW MORE OF HER THAN I DID TOLD ME SHE WAS RATHER NERVOUS
TILL WE CAME TO HIS GATE THERE WAS A SHORT DRIVE UP TO THE HOUSE BETWEEN TALL EVERGREENS BLANTYRE ALIGHTED AT THE GATE AND WAS GOING TO OPEN IT FOR LADY ANNE BUT SHE SAID I WILL WAIT FOR YOU HERE
WHICH HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM THEN THE KING CALLED FOR THE PRINCESSES AND ASKED THEM WHETHER WHAT THE SOLDIER SAID WAS TRUE AND WHEN THEY SAW THAT THEY WERE DISCOVERED
LET ME BEG YOU TO HAVE THE SADDLES CHANGED MY DEAR COUSIN SAID LADY ANNE LAUGHING PRAY DO NOT TROUBLE YOUR GOOD CAREFUL HEAD ABOUT ME I HAVE BEEN A HORSEWOMAN EVER SINCE I WAS A BABY
BUT THE ELDEST SAID IT IS ONLY OUR PRINCES WHO ARE SHOUTING FOR JOY AT OUR APPROACH THEN THEY CAME TO ANOTHER GROVE OF TREES WHERE ALL THE LEAVES WERE OF GOLD AND AFTERWARDS TO A THIRD WHERE THE LEAVES WERE ALL GLITTERING DIAMONDS
BUT SOMETIMES WHEN SHE CAME BACK I COULD SEE THAT SHE HAD BEEN VERY MUCH STRAINED AND NOW AND THEN SHE GAVE A SHORT COUGH SHE HAD TOO MUCH SPIRIT TO COMPLAIN BUT I COULD NOT HELP FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT HER
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN HOW MANY KINGS SONS HAVE ALREADY WATCHED IN VAIN AND AS FOR THIS SOLDIER EVEN IF I HAD NOT GIVEN HIM HIS SLEEPING DRAUGHT
AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE COACH HOUSES AND STABLES ON THE OTHER MY OWNER PULLED UP AT ONE OF THE HOUSES AND WHISTLED THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A YOUNG WOMAN FOLLOWED BY A LITTLE GIRL AND BOY RAN OUT
BUT WHOEVER TRIED AND DID NOT SUCCEED AFTER THREE DAYS AND NIGHTS SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH A KING'S SON SOON CAME HE WAS WELL ENTERTAINED AND IN THE EVENING
IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE GINGER CAME BACK AND BEFORE WE WERE LEFT ALONE AND THEN SHE TOLD ME ALL THAT SHE HAD SEEN I CAN'T TELL MUCH SHE SAID WE WENT A GALLOP NEARLY ALL THE WAY
BEGAN TO THINK HE SHOULD NOT GET ALL HE ASKED AND MUST COME DOWN BUT JUST THEN THE GRAY EYED MAN CAME BACK AGAIN I COULD NOT HELP REACHING OUT MY HEAD TOWARD HIM HE STROKED MY FACE KINDLY
AS THEY WERE TROTTED OUT WITH A LEADING REIN THE GROOM RUNNING BY THE SIDE BUT ROUND IN THE BACKGROUND THERE WERE A NUMBER OF POOR THINGS SADLY BROKEN DOWN WITH HARD WORK WITH THEIR KNEES KNUCKLING OVER
TALKING TO HIMSELF AND TALKING TO ME HALF AN HOUR AFTER WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO LONDON THROUGH PLEASANT LANES AND COUNTRY ROADS UNTIL WE CAME INTO THE GREAT LONDON THOROUGHFARE ON WHICH WE TRAVELED STEADILY
THERE HAD BEEN A WIDE DIKE RECENTLY CUT AND THE EARTH FROM THE CUTTING WAS CAST UP ROUGHLY ON THE OTHER SIDE SURELY THIS WOULD STOP THEM BUT NO WITH SCARCELY A PAUSE LIZZIE TOOK THE LEAP
WOULD THEY ASK THIS QUESTION FOR HER AT DOCTOR ASHLEY'S AND BRING THE ANSWER THE VILLAGE WAS ABOUT A MILE OFF AND THE DOCTOR'S HOUSE WAS THE LAST IN IT WE WENT ALONG GAYLY ENOUGH
AND I WILL TRY YOUR CHARMING LIZZIE YOU MUST CONFESS THAT IN SIZE AND APPEARANCE
AND THE SOLDIER STEPPED INTO THE SAME BOAT WITH THE YOUNGEST AS THEY WERE ROWING OVER THE LAKE THE PRINCE WHO WAS IN THE BOAT WITH THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS AND THE SOLDIER SAID I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT IS BUT THOUGH I AM ROWING WITH ALL MY MIGHT
AND JUST CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE FLYING FIGURE NOW FAR AWAY ON THE ROAD IN AN INSTANT HE SPRANG TO THE SADDLE I NEEDED NO WHIP NO SPUR FOR I WAS AS EAGER AS MY RIDER
LONG STRINGS OF YOUNG HORSES OUT OF THE COUNTRY FRESH FROM THE MARSHES AND DROVES OF SHAGGY LITTLE WELSH PONIES NO HIGHER THAN MERRYLEGS AND HUNDREDS OF CART HORSES OF ALL SORTS
EACH ONE BALANCED ON A LONG BRANCH THAT DIPPED AND SWAYED BENEATH THE WEIGHT WE PAUSED UNCERTAIN IF WE PURSUED FURTHER THE BOUGHS WOULD BREAK UNDER THE DOUBLE BURDEN WE MIGHT SHAKE THEM OFF PERHAPS BUT NONE OF US WAS SO INCLINED
THE REST OF THE WORLD NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT THAT COUNTRY I HAVEN'T SAID WHERE IT WAS FOR FEAR SOME SELF APPOINTED MISSIONARIES OR TRADERS OR LAND GREEDY EXPANSIONISTS WILL TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO PUSH IN THEY WILL NOT BE WANTED I CAN TELL THEM THAT
HIS GREAT AIM WAS EXPLORATION HE USED TO MAKE ALL KINDS OF A ROW BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO EXPLORE NOW ONLY PATCHWORK AND FILLING IN HE SAID HE FILLED IN WELL ENOUGH HE HAD A LOT OF TALENTS GREAT ON MECHANICS AND ELECTRICITY
AND WE HAD TO GET BACK TO OUR PARTY BEFORE NIGHT
THERE AMONG THE BOUGHS OVERHEAD WAS SOMETHING MORE THAN ONE SOMETHING THAT CLUNG MOTIONLESS CLOSE TO THE GREAT TRUNK AT FIRST AND THEN AS ONE AND ALL WE STARTED UP THE TREE
AS FOR ME SOCIOLOGY'S MY MAJOR YOU HAVE TO BACK THAT UP WITH A LOT OF OTHER SCIENCES OF COURSE
WHILE WE CLIMBED DOWNWARD AS SWIFTLY AS WE COULD WE HEARD THEIR VANISHING GAY LAUGHTER WE SAW THEM FLEETING AWAY IN THE WIDE OPEN REACHES OF THE FOREST AND GAVE CHASE BUT WE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE CHASED WILD ANTELOPES SO WE STOPPED AT LENGTH SOMEWHAT BREATHLESS
HE LIVED UP TO HIS IDEALS YOU MIGHT SAY TERRY DID TOO IF YOU CAN CALL HIS VIEWS ABOUT WOMEN ANYTHING SO POLITE AS IDEALS I ALWAYS LIKED TERRY HE WAS A MAN'S MAN VERY MUCH SO GENEROUS AND BRAVE AND CLEVER BUT
WHOLE BOOKS FULL OF NOTES CAREFULLY COPIED RECORDS FIRSTHAND DESCRIPTIONS AND THE PICTURES THAT'S THE WORST LOSS WE HAD SOME BIRD'S EYES OF THE CITIES AND PARKS
OR WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS THE MAIN STREAM
THESE TOWERING TREES WERE UNDER AS CAREFUL CULTIVATION AS SO MANY CABBAGES IN OTHER CONDITIONS
A SORT OF WEDDING CALL THIS IS A CONDITION KNOWN TO HAVE EXISTED HERE'S JUST A SURVIVAL
SO WE GOT THE BIG BIPLANE TOGETHER AND LOADED IT WITH OUR SCIENTIFICALLY COMPRESSED BAGGAGE THE CAMERA OF COURSE THE GLASSES A SUPPLY OF CONCENTRATED FOOD OUR POCKETS WERE MAGAZINES OF SMALL NECESSITIES AND WE HAD OUR GUNS OF COURSE THERE WAS NO KNOWING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN
CHAPTER ONE A NOT UNNATURAL ENTERPRISE THIS IS WRITTEN FROM MEMORY UNFORTUNATELY IF I COULD HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME THE MATERIAL I SO CAREFULLY PREPARED THIS WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT STORY
MY WORD THE MEN OF THIS COUNTRY MUST BE GOOD SPRINTERS INHABITANTS EVIDENTLY ARBOREAL I GRIMLY SUGGESTED CIVILIZED AND STILL ARBOREAL PECULIAR PEOPLE
TERRY GOT OUT HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS AND SQUATTED DOWN TO INVESTIGATE CHEMICALS OF SOME SORT I CAN'T TELL ON THE SPOT LOOK TO ME LIKE DYESTUFFS LET'S GET NEARER HE URGED UP THERE BY THE FALL
IT WAS ONLY A RAG A LONG RAVELED FRAGMENT OF CLOTH BUT IT WAS A WELL WOVEN FABRIC WITH A PATTERN AND OF A CLEAR SCARLET THAT THE WATER HAD NOT FADED
ALMOST LOSING HIS POSITION AS HIS HAND CLUTCHED ONLY AIR AND THEN WITH INCONCEIVABLE RAPIDITY THE THREE BRIGHT CREATURES WERE GONE THEY DROPPED FROM THE ENDS OF THE BIG BOUGHS TO THOSE BELOW FAIRLY POURING THEMSELVES OFF THE TREE
THERE WAS A DESPERATE TANGLE OF WOOD AND WATER AND A SWAMPY PATCH WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE FOUND OUR WAY ACROSS ALONE BUT THERE WAS ONE AND I COULD SEE TERRY WITH COMPASS AND NOTEBOOK MARKING DIRECTIONS AND TRYING TO PLACE LANDMARKS
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TERRY REMARKED DRILY GO YOU'LL HAVE TO GET AN INJUNCTION TO STOP ME BOTH JEFF AND I WERE SURE ABOUT THAT BUT
SO WE JOKED AND DISPUTED AND SPECULATED AND AFTER AN INTERMINABLE JOURNEY WE GOT TO OUR OLD CAMPING PLACE AT LAST
AS FREE FROM SUSPICION AS A CHILD'S WHO HAS NEVER BEEN REBUKED HER INTEREST WAS MORE THAT OF AN INTENT BOY PLAYING A FASCINATING GAME THAN OF A GIRL LURED BY AN ORNAMENT THE OTHERS MOVED A BIT FARTHER OUT HOLDING FIRMLY WATCHING
WE'LL LEAVE PAPERS WITH OUR CONSUL WHERE THE YACHT STAYS TERRY PLANNED
WELL TERRY WAS POPULAR AMONG WOMEN EVEN WHEN THERE WERE OTHER MEN AROUND AND IT'S NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT HE HAD PLEASANT DREAMS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN I COULD SEE IT IN HIS EYES AS HE LAY THERE
NOW FOR THE FOLKS I'VE HAD ENOUGH SCENERY SO WE SAILED LOW CROSSING BACK AND FORTH QUARTERING THE COUNTRY AS WE WENT AND STUDYING IT WE SAW I CAN'T REMEMBER NOW HOW MUCH OF THIS WE NOTED THEN AND HOW MUCH WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY OUR LATER KNOWLEDGE
MAY BE HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM THE RANGE THEY CROP OUT LIKE THAT SUDDENLY WE LEFT THE LAKE AND STRUCK DIRECTLY TOWARD THE CLIFFS WE HEARD RUNNING WATER BEFORE WE REACHED IT AND THE GUIDE POINTED PROUDLY TO HIS RIVER IT WAS SHORT
THE REST SPLENDID HARDWOOD CALL THIS A FOREST IT'S A TRUCK FARM GOOD THING TO HAVE A BOTANIST ON HAND I AGREED SURE THERE ARE NO MEDICINAL ONES OR ANY FOR PURE ORNAMENT AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY WERE QUITE RIGHT
WE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS COUNTRY FOR OVER A YEAR HARDLY BELIEVING THAT THERE WAS SUCH A PLACE AND NOW WE WERE IN IT
BUT NOT QUITE TO HIS FULL STRETCH SHE WAS VISIBLY MOVED I NOTED HESITATED SPOKE TO HER COMPANIONS THEY CHATTERED SOFTLY TOGETHER
THEY WERE PERFECTLY FRIENDLY NOW WE'VE SCARED THEM BUT IT WAS NO USE GRUMBLING AND TERRY REFUSED TO ADMIT ANY MISTAKE NONSENSE HE SAID THEY EXPECTED IT WOMEN LIKE TO BE RUN AFTER
AND WILL FARE WORSE THAN WE DID IF THEY DO FIND IT IT BEGAN THIS WAY THERE WERE THREE OF US CLASSMATES AND FRIENDS TERRY O NICHOLSON
THOSE NATIVES CAN'T GET INTO IT OR HURT IT OR MOVE IT TERRY EXPLAINED PROUDLY WE'LL START OUR FLIER FROM THE LAKE AND LEAVE THE BOAT AS A BASE TO COME BACK TO IF WE COME BACK I SUGGESTED CHEERFULLY FRAID THE LADIES WILL EAT YOU HE SCOFFED
UNDERSTOOD WHETHER THEY REALLY WERE INCONSISTENT BETTER THAN WE BETTER THAN HE WHO AFFIRMS THAT THEY ARE INCONSISTENT IT IS SURELY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT THE THIRTY NINE FRAMERS OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION
THE SAME QUESTION OF PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN THE TERRITORY AGAIN CAME BEFORE THE CONGRESS OF THE CONFEDERATION AND TWO MORE OF THE THIRTY NINE WHO AFTERWARD SIGNED THE CONSTITUTION WERE IN THAT CONGRESS AND VOTED ON THE QUESTION
WHICH HE DEEMS CONSTITUTIONAL IF AT THE SAME TIME HE DEEMS IT INEXPEDIENT IT THEREFORE WOULD BE UNSAFE TO SET DOWN EVEN THE TWO WHO VOTED AGAINST THE PROHIBITION AS HAVING DONE SO BECAUSE IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING
I HAVE PURPOSELY OMITTED WHATEVER UNDERSTANDING MAY HAVE BEEN MANIFESTED BY ANY PERSON HOWEVER DISTINGUISHED OTHER THAN THE THIRTY NINE FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AND FOR THE SAME REASON
WHICH ACT EMBODIED THE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT UPON THAT SUBJECT UP TO AND AT THE VERY MOMENT HE PENNED THAT WARNING AND ABOUT ONE YEAR AFTER HE PENNED IT HE WROTE LA FAYETTE THAT HE CONSIDERED THAT PROHIBITION A WISE MEASURE EXPRESSING IN THE SAME CONNECTION
THAT FAULT IS PRIMARILY YOURS
AS NO BETTER THAN OUTLAWS YOU WILL GRANT A HEARING TO PIRATES OR MURDERERS BUT NOTHING LIKE IT TO BLACK REPUBLICANS IN ALL YOUR CONTENTIONS WITH ONE ANOTHER EACH OF YOU DEEMS AN UNCONDITIONAL CONDEMNATION OF BLACK REPUBLICANISM
UPON THIS SENATOR DOUGLAS HOLDS THE AFFIRMATIVE AND REPUBLICANS THE NEGATIVE THIS AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL FORM AN ISSUE AND THIS ISSUE THIS QUESTION IS PRECISELY WHAT THE TEXT DECLARES OUR FATHERS UNDERSTOOD
THE ANSWER MUST BE THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES THAT CONSTITUTION CONSISTS OF THE ORIGINAL FRAMED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND UNDER WHICH THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT FIRST WENT INTO OPERATION AND TWELVE SUBSEQUENTLY FRAMED AMENDMENTS
NOR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION
BLOOD AND THUNDER AMONG THE SLAVES SLAVE INSURRECTIONS ARE NO MORE COMMON NOW THAN THEY WERE BEFORE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS ORGANIZED WHAT INDUCED THE SOUTHAMPTON INSURRECTION TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO
WHETHER YOUR CLAIM OF CONSERVATISM FOR YOURSELVES AND YOUR CHARGE OF DESTRUCTIVENESS AGAINST US ARE BASED ON THE MOST CLEAR AND STABLE FOUNDATIONS AGAIN YOU SAY WE HAVE MADE THE SLAVERY QUESTION MORE PROMINENT THAN IT FORMERLY WAS
THE FIRST TEN OF WHICH WERE FRAMED IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE WHO WERE OUR FATHERS THAT FRAMED THE CONSTITUTION I SUPPOSE THE THIRTY NINE WHO SIGNED THE ORIGINAL INSTRUMENT MAY BE FAIRLY CALLED OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THAT PART OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT
IN WHICH AT LEAST THREE TIMES AS MANY LIVES WERE LOST AS AT HARPER'S FERRY YOU CAN SCARCELY STRETCH YOUR VERY ELASTIC FANCY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SOUTHAMPTON WAS GOT UP BY BLACK REPUBLICANISM
PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENT CENTURY AND I MIGHT ALMOST SAY PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE LAST HALF OF THE PRESENT CENTURY DECLARE THAT IN HIS UNDERSTANDING ANY PROPER DIVISION OF LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION
SEEMS NOT TO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY BEFORE THE CONVENTION WHICH FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AND HENCE IT IS NOT RECORDED THAT THE THIRTY NINE OR ANY OF THEM WHILE ENGAGED ON THAT INSTRUMENT EXPRESSED ANY OPINION ON THAT PRECISE QUESTION
FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN THE FEDERAL TERRITORIES THUS THE TWENTY ONE ACTED AND AS ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS SO ACTIONS UNDER SUCH RESPONSIBILITIES SPEAK STILL LOUDER
BUT TO BE TOLERATED AND PROTECTED ONLY BECAUSE OF AND SO FAR AS ITS ACTUAL PRESENCE AMONG US MAKES THAT TOLERATION AND PROTECTION A NECESSITY LET ALL THE GUARANTIES THOSE FATHERS GAVE IT BE NOT GRUDGINGLY
AND WHAT IS YOUR PROOF HARPER'S FERRY JOHN BROWN JOHN BROWN WAS NO REPUBLICAN AND YOU HAVE FAILED TO IMPLICATE A SINGLE REPUBLICAN IN HIS HARPER'S FERRY ENTERPRISE
AND ARE JUSTLY OPPOSED AND DENOUNCED AS SUCH MEET US THEN ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OUR PRINCIPLE PUT IN PRACTICE WOULD WRONG YOUR SECTION
BUT FULLY AND FAIRLY MAINTAINED FOR THIS REPUBLICANS CONTEND AND WITH THIS SO FAR AS I KNOW OR BELIEVE THEY WILL BE CONTENT AND NOW IF THEY WOULD LISTEN AS I SUPPOSE THEY WILL NOT
AND ACT AS THEY ACTED UPON IT THIS IS ALL REPUBLICANS ASK ALL REPUBLICANS DESIRE IN RELATION TO SLAVERY AS THOSE FATHERS MARKED IT SO LET IT BE AGAIN MARKED AS AN EVIL NOT TO BE EXTENDED
IN COMMON WITH OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE DECLARE OUR BELIEF THAT SLAVERY IS WRONG BUT THE SLAVES DO NOT HEAR US DECLARE EVEN THIS FOR ANY THING WE SAY OR DO
AND PASSED AFTER THE ACT ENFORCING THE ORDINANCE OF EIGHTY SEVEN SO THAT DURING THE WHOLE PENDENCY OF THE ACT TO ENFORCE THE ORDINANCE THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WERE ALSO PENDING THE SEVENTY SIX MEMBERS OF THAT CONGRESS
SOME OF YOU ARE FOR REVIVING THE FOREIGN SLAVE TRADE SOME FOR A CONGRESSIONAL SLAVE CODE FOR THE TERRITORIES SOME FOR CONGRESS FORBIDDING THE TERRITORIES TO PROHIBIT SLAVERY WITHIN THEIR LIMITS SOME FOR MAINTAINING SLAVERY IN THE TERRITORIES THROUGH THE JUDICIARY
ACTED UPON THE VERY QUESTION WHICH THE TEXT AFFIRMS THEY UNDERSTOOD JUST AS WELL AND EVEN BETTER THAN WE DO NOW AND TWENTY ONE OF THEM A CLEAR MAJORITY OF THE WHOLE THIRTY NINE SO ACTING UPON IT
IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE BY THE FIRST CONGRESS WHICH SAT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AN ACT WAS PASSED TO ENFORCE THE ORDINANCE OF EIGHTY SEVEN INCLUDING THE PROHIBITION OF SLAVERY IN THE NORTHWESTERN TERRITORY
WHEN THEY FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE UNDERSTOOD THIS QUESTION JUST AS WELL AND EVEN BETTER THAN WE DO NOW I FULLY INDORSE THIS AND I ADOPT IT AS A TEXT FOR THIS DISCOURSE
WITH A RENEWAL OF TENDERNESS HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO HER ROOM ON LEAVING THE DINING PARLOUR AND SAT WITH HER TILL SUMMONED TO COFFEE SHE WAS STILL VERY POORLY AND ELIZABETH WOULD NOT QUIT HER AT ALL TILL LATE IN THE EVENING
WALKING WAS HER ONLY ALTERNATIVE SHE DECLARED HER RESOLUTION HOW CAN YOU BE SO SILLY CRIED HER MOTHER AS TO THINK OF SUCH A THING IN ALL THIS DIRT YOU WILL NOT BE FIT TO BE SEEN WHEN YOU GET THERE I SHALL BE VERY FIT TO SEE JANE WHICH IS ALL I WANT
YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT OH CERTAINLY CRIED HIS FAITHFUL ASSISTANT NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING
OF THE MOST INTERESTING INTELLIGENCE EVERY DAY ADDED SOMETHING TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE OFFICERS NAMES AND CONNECTIONS THEIR LODGINGS WERE NOT LONG A SECRET AND AT LENGTH THEY BEGAN TO KNOW THE OFFICERS THEMSELVES MISTER PHILLIPS VISITED THEM ALL
AND HAVING NO FEELINGS OF DIFFIDENCE TO MAKE IT DISTRESSING TO HIMSELF EVEN AT THE MOMENT HE SET ABOUT IT IN A VERY ORDERLY MANNER WITH ALL THE OBSERVANCES WHICH HE SUPPOSED A REGULAR PART OF THE BUSINESS ON FINDING MISSUS BENNET ELIZABETH
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE FOR ME TO STATE MY REASONS FOR MARRYING AND MOREOVER FOR COMING INTO HERTFORDSHIRE WITH THE DESIGN OF SELECTING A WIFE AS I CERTAINLY DID THE IDEA OF MISTER COLLINS WITH ALL HIS SOLEMN COMPOSURE
WHOM THEY SECRETLY MEAN TO ACCEPT WHEN HE FIRST APPLIES FOR THEIR FAVOUR AND THAT SOMETIMES THE REFUSAL IS REPEATED A SECOND OR EVEN A THIRD TIME I AM THEREFORE BY NO MEANS DISCOURAGED BY WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID
IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT ANOTHER OFFER OF MARRIAGE MAY EVER BE MADE YOU YOUR PORTION IS UNHAPPILY SO SMALL THAT IT WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD UNDO THE EFFECTS OF YOUR LOVELINESS AND AMIABLE QUALIFICATIONS
SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS AND SO EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED FOR HER AGE HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE IS EXQUISITE IT IS AMAZING TO ME SAID BINGLEY HOW YOUNG LADIES CAN HAVE PATIENCE TO BE SO VERY ACCOMPLISHED AS THEY ALL ARE
BEFORE ELIZABETH HAD TIME FOR ANYTHING BUT A BLUSH OF SURPRISE MISSUS BENNET ANSWERED INSTANTLY OH DEAR YES CERTAINLY I AM SURE LIZZY WILL BE VERY HAPPY I AM SURE SHE CAN HAVE NO OBJECTION COME KITTY
ALMOST AS SOON AS I ENTERED THE HOUSE I SINGLED YOU OUT AS THE COMPANION OF MY FUTURE LIFE
ON THE FIRST APPLICATION AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE EVEN NOW SAID AS MUCH TO ENCOURAGE MY SUIT AS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TRUE DELICACY OF THE FEMALE CHARACTER REALLY MISTER COLLINS CRIED ELIZABETH WITH SOME WARMTH YOU PUZZLE ME EXCEEDINGLY
BY WHOM ELIZABETH SAT HE WAS AN INDOLENT MAN WHO LIVED ONLY TO EAT DRINK AND PLAY AT CARDS WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER WHEN DINNER WAS OVER SHE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO JANE
AND SHE WAS EAGERLY CALLING OUT WHILE HER DAUGHTER READ WELL JANE WHO IS IT FROM WHAT IS IT ABOUT WHAT DOES HE SAY WELL JANE MAKE HASTE AND TELL US MAKE HASTE MY LOVE IT IS FROM MISS BINGLEY SAID JANE AND THEN READ IT ALOUD
WHEN I DO MYSELF THE HONOUR OF SPEAKING TO YOU NEXT ON THE SUBJECT I SHALL HOPE TO RECEIVE A MORE FAVOURABLE ANSWER THAN YOU HAVE NOW GIVEN ME THOUGH I AM FAR FROM ACCUSING YOU OF CRUELTY AT PRESENT
AND FINDING HERSELF AT LAST WITHIN VIEW OF THE HOUSE WITH WEARY ANKLES DIRTY STOCKINGS AND A FACE GLOWING WITH THE WARMTH OF EXERCISE SHE WAS SHOWN INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR WHERE ALL BUT JANE WERE ASSEMBLED
MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE I DESERVE NEITHER SUCH PRAISE NOR SUCH CENSURE CRIED ELIZABETH
AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM HER MANNERS WERE PRONOUNCED TO BE VERY BAD INDEED A MIXTURE OF PRIDE AND IMPERTINENCE SHE HAD NO CONVERSATION NO STYLE NO BEAUTY MISSUS HURST THOUGHT THE SAME AND ADDED
VERY UNWELL THIS MORNING WHICH I SUPPOSE IS TO BE IMPUTED TO MY GETTING WET THROUGH YESTERDAY MY KIND FRIENDS WILL NOT HEAR OF MY RETURNING TILL I AM BETTER THEY INSIST ALSO ON MY SEEING MISTER JONES
YOU ARE TOO HASTY SIR SHE CRIED YOU FORGET THAT I HAVE MADE NO ANSWER LET ME DO IT WITHOUT FURTHER LOSS OF TIME ACCEPT MY THANKS FOR THE COMPLIMENT YOU ARE PAYING ME I AM VERY SENSIBLE OF THE HONOUR OF YOUR PROPOSALS
AS IF THE CREDIT OF MAKING IT RAIN WERE ALL HER OWN TILL THE NEXT MORNING HOWEVER SHE WAS NOT AWARE OF ALL THE FELICITY OF HER CONTRIVANCE BREAKFAST WAS SCARCELY OVER WHEN A SERVANT FROM NETHERFIELD BROUGHT THE FOLLOWING NOTE FOR ELIZABETH MY DEAREST LIZZY I FIND MYSELF
AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE
A MOST COUNTRY TOWN INDIFFERENCE TO DECORUM IT SHOWS AN AFFECTION FOR HER SISTER THAT IS VERY PLEASING SAID BINGLEY I AM AFRAID MISTER DARCY OBSERVED MISS BINGLEY IN A HALF WHISPER
BUT IN MY OPINION IT IS A PALTRY DEVICE A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED THERE IS A MEANNESS IN ALL THE ARTS WHICH LADIES SOMETIMES CONDESCEND TO EMPLOY FOR CAPTIVATION
I CANNOT BOAST OF KNOWING MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE THAT ARE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED NOR I I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY THEN OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN
IS THIS A HINT TO ME LIZZY SAID HER FATHER TO SEND FOR THE HORSES NO INDEED I DO NOT WISH TO AVOID THE WALK THE DISTANCE IS NOTHING WHEN ONE HAS A MOTIVE ONLY THREE MILES I SHALL BE BACK BY DINNER
THEY WERE WELL SUPPLIED BOTH WITH NEWS AND HAPPINESS BY THE RECENT ARRIVAL OF A MILITIA REGIMENT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD IT WAS TO REMAIN THE WHOLE WINTER AND MERYTON WAS THE HEADQUARTERS THEIR VISITS TO MISSUS PHILLIPS WERE NOW PRODUCTIVE
MONSIEUR MANETTE DO YOU REMEMBER NOTHING OF ME THE SHOE DROPPED TO THE GROUND AND HE SAT LOOKING FIXEDLY AT THE QUESTIONER MONSIEUR MANETTE MISTER LORRY LAID HIS HAND UPON DEFARGE'S ARM
IN THE PAUSES OF HIS QUICK AND LABOURED BREATHING HE WAS HEARD TO SAY WHAT IS THIS WITH THE TEARS STREAMING DOWN HER FACE SHE PUT HER TWO HANDS TO HER LIPS AND KISSED THEM TO HIM THEN CLASPED THEM ON HER BREAST AS IF SHE LAID HIS RUINED HEAD THERE
YOU CAN BEAR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT I MUST BEAR IT IF YOU LET IT IN LAYING THE PALEST SHADOW OF A STRESS UPON THE SECOND WORD THE OPENED HALF DOOR WAS OPENED A LITTLE FURTHER AND SECURED AT THAT ANGLE FOR THE TIME
ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE NORTH TOWER AND WHEN HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM
I CAN'T SAY THAT I MEAN TO I SUPPOSE SO I DON'T KNOW BUT THE QUESTION REMINDED HIM OF HIS WORK AND HE BENT OVER IT AGAIN
I HAVE HAD A PATTERN IN MY HAND HE GLANCED AT THE SHOE WITH SOME LITTLE PASSING TOUCH OF PRIDE AND THE MAKER'S NAME SAID DEFARGE NOW THAT HE HAD NO WORK TO HOLD HE LAID THE KNUCKLES OF THE RIGHT HAND IN THE HOLLOW OF THE LEFT
MORE THAN THAT MONSIEUR MANETTE IS FOR ALL REASONS BEST OUT OF FRANCE SAY SHALL I HIRE A CARRIAGE AND POST HORSES THAT'S BUSINESS SAID MISTER LORRY RESUMING ON THE SHORTEST NOTICE HIS METHODICAL MANNERS AND IF BUSINESS IS TO BE DONE
IN THE SCARED BLANK WONDER OF HIS FACE WHETHER HE KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHETHER HE RECOLLECTED WHAT THEY HAD SAID TO HIM
HE HAD TAKEN IT UP AND WAS STOOPING TO WORK AGAIN WHEN HIS EYES CAUGHT THE SKIRT OF HER DRESS HE RAISED THEM AND SAW HER FACE THE TWO SPECTATORS STARTED FORWARD BUT SHE STAYED THEM WITH A MOTION OF HER HAND
THEY ONCE MORE WHISPERED IN THE EARS OF MISTER JARVIS LORRY SITTING OPPOSITE THE BURIED MAN WHO HAD BEEN DUG OUT AND WONDERING WHAT SUBTLE POWERS WERE FOR EVER LOST TO HIM AND WHAT WERE CAPABLE OF RESTORATION THE OLD INQUIRY
I HOPE YOU CARE TO BE RECALLED TO LIFE AND THE OLD ANSWER
AND THEN THE KNUCKLES OF THE LEFT HAND IN THE HOLLOW OF THE RIGHT
HE HAD A WHITE BEARD RAGGEDLY CUT BUT NOT VERY LONG A HOLLOW FACE AND EXCEEDINGLY BRIGHT EYES THE HOLLOWNESS AND THINNESS OF HIS FACE WOULD HAVE CAUSED THEM TO LOOK LARGE UNDER HIS YET DARK EYEBROWS AND HIS CONFUSED WHITE HAIR
ARE YOU GOING TO FINISH THAT PAIR OF SHOES TO DAY ASKED DEFARGE MOTIONING TO MISTER LORRY TO COME FORWARD WHAT DID YOU SAY DO YOU MEAN TO FINISH THAT PAIR OF SHOES TO DAY
IT DIED OUT AS EVERYTHING BUT HIS SHOEMAKING DID DIE OUT OF HIM AND HE REFOLDED HIS LITTLE PACKET AND TRIED TO SECURE IT IN HIS BREAST BUT HE STILL LOOKED AT HER AND GLOOMILY SHOOK HIS HEAD NO NO NO YOU ARE TOO YOUNG TOO BLOOMING
HE READILY RESPONDED TO HIS DAUGHTER'S DRAWING HER ARM THROUGH HIS AND TOOK AND KEPT HER HAND IN BOTH HIS OWN THEY BEGAN TO DESCEND MONSIEUR DEFARGE GOING FIRST WITH THE LAMP MISTER LORRY CLOSING THE LITTLE PROCESSION
I I LEARNT IT HERE I TAUGHT MYSELF I ASKED LEAVE TO HE LAPSED AWAY EVEN FOR MINUTES RINGING THOSE MEASURED CHANGES ON HIS HANDS THE WHOLE TIME
BUT THEY WERE NATURALLY LARGE AND LOOKED UNNATURALLY SO HIS YELLOW RAGS OF SHIRT LAY OPEN AT THE THROAT AND SHOWED HIS BODY TO BE WITHERED AND WORN HE AND HIS OLD CANVAS FROCK AND HIS LOOSE STOCKINGS AND ALL HIS POOR TATTERS OF CLOTHES
THEY HAD NOT TRAVERSED MANY STEPS OF THE LONG MAIN STAIRCASE WHEN HE STOPPED AND STARED AT THE ROOF AND ROUND AT THE WALLS YOU REMEMBER THE PLACE MY FATHER YOU REMEMBER COMING UP HERE WHAT DID YOU SAY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD REPEAT THE QUESTION
WHO HAD CREPT ALONG THE WALL TO A POINT WHERE SHE COULD SEE HIM AND WHERE SHE NOW STOOD LOOKING AT HIM WITH HANDS WHICH AT FIRST HAD BEEN ONLY RAISED IN FRIGHTENED COMPASSION IF NOT EVEN TO KEEP HIM OFF AND SHUT OUT THE SIGHT OF HIM BUT WHICH WERE NOW EXTENDING TOWARDS HIM
I SAID COULDN'T YOU DESCRIBE THE KIND OF SHOE FOR MONSIEUR'S INFORMATION IT IS A LADY'S SHOE IT IS A YOUNG LADY'S WALKING SHOE IT IS IN THE PRESENT MODE I NEVER SAW THE MODE
YOU CAN BEAR A LITTLE MORE THE SHOEMAKER STOPPED HIS WORK LOOKED WITH A VACANT AIR OF LISTENING AT THE FLOOR ON ONE SIDE OF HIM THEN SIMILARLY AT THE FLOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HIM THEN UPWARD AT THE SPEAKER WHAT DID YOU SAY
YOU ARE STILL HARD AT WORK I SEE AFTER A LONG SILENCE THE HEAD WAS LIFTED FOR ANOTHER MOMENT AND THE VOICE REPLIED YES I AM WORKING THIS TIME A PAIR OF HAGGARD EYES HAD LOOKED AT THE QUESTIONER
SOME SO REMOTE FROM THIS LITTLE EARTH THAT THE LEARNED TELL US IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THEIR RAYS HAVE EVEN YET DISCOVERED IT AS A POINT IN SPACE WHERE ANYTHING IS SUFFERED OR DONE THE SHADOWS OF THE NIGHT WERE BROAD AND BLACK ALL THROUGH THE COLD AND RESTLESS INTERVAL UNTIL DAWN
THE POSTILION CRACKED HIS WHIP AND THEY CLATTERED AWAY UNDER THE FEEBLE OVER SWINGING LAMPS UNDER THE OVER SWINGING LAMPS SWINGING EVER BRIGHTER IN THE BETTER STREETS AND EVER DIMMER IN THE WORSE AND BY LIGHTED SHOPS GAY CROWDS
ADIEU FROM DEFARGE AND SO UNDER A SHORT GROVE OF FEEBLER AND FEEBLER OVER SWINGING LAMPS OUT UNDER THE GREAT GROVE OF STARS BENEATH THAT ARCH OF UNMOVED AND ETERNAL LIGHTS
NO CROWD WAS ABOUT THE DOOR NO PEOPLE WERE DISCERNIBLE AT ANY OF THE MANY WINDOWS
WITH A WEARY SOUND THAT WAS NOT A SIGH NOR A GROAN HE BENT TO WORK AGAIN UNTIL THE SILENCE WAS AGAIN BROKEN YOU ARE NOT A SHOEMAKER BY TRADE SAID MISTER LORRY LOOKING STEADFASTLY AT HIM
HE HAD GRADUALLY DROPPED TO THE FLOOR AND LAY THERE IN A LETHARGY WORN OUT SHE HAD NESTLED DOWN WITH HIM THAT HIS HEAD MIGHT LIE UPON HER ARM AND HER HAIR DROOPING OVER HIM CURTAINED HIM FROM THE LIGHT
WEEP FOR IT AND IF WHEN I SHALL TELL YOU OF MY NAME AND OF MY FATHER WHO IS LIVING AND OF MY MOTHER WHO IS DEAD
YOU HAVE COME ONLY TO DISTRESS ME A LONELY WOMAN AND SHORTEN MY DAYS I WISH THAT YOU WOULD BESTOW YOUR PRESENCE WHERE YOU BESTOW YOUR LOVE CLYM SAID HUSKILY YOU ARE MY MOTHER I WILL SAY NO MORE BEYOND THIS
QUITE ENOUGH TO OVERLOAD ITS STOMACH AND MAKE IT UNCOMFORTABLE THE ELDERLY FEMALE WAS A WOMAN OF WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE SHE KNEW WHAT WAS GOOD FOR CHILDREN AND SHE HAD A VERY ACCURATE PERCEPTION OF WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HERSELF
THAT HE HAD GOT HIS OWN HORSE DOWN TO A STRAW A DAY AND WOULD UNQUESTIONABLY HAVE RENDERED HIM A VERY SPIRITED AND RAMPACIOUS ANIMAL ON NOTHING AT ALL IF HE HAD NOT DIED FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS BEFORE HE WAS TO HAVE HAD HIS FIRST COMFORTABLE BAIT OF AIR
FOR AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THE CHILD HAD CONTRIVED TO EXIST UPON THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE PORTION OF THE WEAKEST POSSIBLE FOOD IT DID PERVERSELY HAPPEN IN EIGHT AND A HALF CASES OUT OF TEN EITHER THAT IT SICKENED FROM WANT AND COLD OR FELL INTO THE FIRE FROM NEGLECT
THE FORMER OF WHOM HAD ALWAYS OPENED THE BODY AND FOUND NOTHING INSIDE WHICH WAS VERY PROBABLE INDEED AND THE LATTER OF WHOM INVARIABLY SWORE WHATEVER THE PARISH WANTED WHICH WAS VERY SELF DEVOTIONAL BESIDES THE BOARD MADE PERIODICAL PILGRIMAGES TO THE FARM
I HAVE COME OUT MYSELF TO TAKE HIM THERE SO LET ME SEE HIM AT ONCE I'LL FETCH HIM DIRECTLY SAID MISSUS MANN LEAVING THE ROOM FOR THAT PURPOSE OLIVER
I DRINK YOUR HEALTH WITH CHEERFULNESS MISSUS MANN AND HE SWALLOWED HALF OF IT AND NOW ABOUT BUSINESS SAID THE BEADLE TAKING OUT A LEATHERN POCKET BOOK THE CHILD THAT WAS HALF BAPTIZED OLIVER TWIST IS NINE YEAR OLD TO DAY
A CERTAIN GLAD AND VOLUPTUOUS AIR OF TRIUMPH PERVADING HER EYES AT HAVING WON BY HER OWN UNAIDED SELF A MAN WHO WAS HER PERFECT COMPLEMENT IN ATTAINMENT APPEARANCE AND AGE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S PART
IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY SYSTEM LEFT TO BE INVENTED THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT OUT AT THE UNIVERSITIES LONG BEFORE THIS TIME NEVER MOTHER THEY CANNOT FIND IT OUT BECAUSE THEIR TEACHERS DON'T COME IN CONTACT WITH THE CLASS WHICH DEMANDS SUCH A SYSTEM
AS THEY WERE EATING THEY SUDDENLY HEARD A LOUD NOISE AND THE SOUND OF A BELL THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM AMONG SOME BRAMBLES AND THICK BUSHES THAT WERE CLOSE BY AND THE SAME INSTANT THEY OBSERVED A BEAUTIFUL GOAT SPOTTED ALL OVER BLACK WHITE AND BROWN SPRING OUT OF THE THICKET
AND THEN WHEN THE REPAST IS OVER AND THE TABLES REMOVED FOR THE KNIGHT TO RECLINE IN THE CHAIR PICKING HIS TEETH PERHAPS AS USUAL AND A DAMSEL MUCH LOVELIER THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS TO ENTER UNEXPECTEDLY BY THE CHAMBER DOOR AND HERSELF BY HIS SIDE
AND RAISE YOUR SPIRITS SHOULD THEY BE DEPRESSED FOR MYSELF I CAN SAY THAT SINCE I HAVE BEEN A KNIGHT ERRANT I HAVE BECOME VALIANT POLITE GENEROUS WELL BRED MAGNANIMOUS COURTEOUS DAUNTLESS GENTLE PATIENT
I THINK YOU WILL SAID MISSUS MANN WHO HAD NOTICED THE TONE OF THE REFUSAL AND THE GESTURE THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED IT JUST A LEETLE DROP WITH A LITTLE COLD WATER AND A LUMP OF SUGAR MISTER BUMBLE COUGHED
FOR BEING A FEMALE AS YOU SAY SHE WILL FOLLOW HER NATURAL INSTINCT IN SPITE OF ALL YOU CAN DO TO PREVENT IT TAKE THIS MORSEL AND DRINK A SUP AND THAT WILL SOOTHE YOUR IRRITATION AND IN THE MEANTIME THE GOAT WILL REST HERSELF AND SO SAYING
GLOOMILY PONDERING HE DISCERNED ABOVE THE FERNS A DRAWN BONNET OF WHITE SILK APPROACHING FROM THE LEFT AND YEOBRIGHT KNEW DIRECTLY THAT IT COVERED THE HEAD OF HER HE LOVED HIS HEART AWOKE FROM ITS APATHY TO A WARM EXCITEMENT AND JUMPING TO HIS FEET HE SAID ALOUD
A BEING TO FIGHT FOR SUPPORT HELP BE MALIGNED FOR
AND IF THE MAN IS NOT WELL FILLED OR HIS ALFORJAS WELL STORED THERE HE MAY STAY AS VERY OFTEN HE DOES TURNED INTO A DRIED MUMMY THOU ART IN THE RIGHT OF IT SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE GO WHERE THOU WILT AND EAT ALL THOU CANST
WHATEVER YOU DO YOU WILL ALWAYS BE DEAR TO ME THAT YOU KNOW BUT ONE THING I HAVE A RIGHT TO SAY WHICH IS THAT AT MY AGE I AM OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR ME MISSUS YEOBRIGHT REMAINED FOR SOME TIME SILENT AND SHAKEN AS IF SHE COULD SAY NO MORE
THEY CANNOT NOBODY DARES TO SPEAK DISRESPECTFULLY OF YOU OR OF ME OH HOW I WISH I WAS SURE OF NEVER LOSING YOU THAT YOU COULD NOT BE ABLE TO DESERT ME ANYHOW CLYM STOOD SILENT A MOMENT
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL OF IT THERE WAS SOMETHING QUEER BETWEEN HER AND THOMASIN'S HUSBAND AT ONE TIME I AM AS SURE OF IT AS THAT I STAND HERE EUSTACIA HAS TOLD ME HE DID PAY HER A LITTLE ATTENTION A YEAR AGO BUT THERE'S NO HARM IN THAT
IF THOU WOULDST WIN THE PRIZE THAT LIES HIDDEN BENEATH THESE DUSKY WAVES PROVE THE VALOUR OF THY STOUT HEART AND CAST THYSELF INTO THE MIDST OF ITS DARK BURNING WATERS
I KNEW SHE WAS SURE TO COME SHE VANISHED IN A HOLLOW FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN HER WHOLE FORM UNFOLDED ITSELF FROM THE BRAKE ONLY YOU HERE SHE EXCLAIMED WITH A DISAPPOINTED AIR WHOSE HOLLOWNESS WAS PROVED BY HER RISING REDNESS AND HER HALF GUILTY LOW LAUGH
SUDDENLY THERE IS PRESENTED TO HIS SIGHT A STRONG CASTLE OR GORGEOUS PALACE WITH WALLS OF MASSY GOLD TURRETS OF DIAMOND AND GATES OF JACINTH IN SHORT SO MARVELLOUS IS ITS STRUCTURE
UPON COMING SUDDENLY INTO HAPPINESS HAVE DIED FROM ANXIETY LEST THEY SHOULD NOT LIVE TO ENJOY IT I FELT MYSELF IN THAT WHIMSICAL STATE OF UNEASINESS LATELY BUT I SHALL BE SPARED IT NOW LET US WALK ON
MY HEART ALIVE MISTER BUMBLE HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU SURE LY NOW MISTER BUMBLE WAS A FAT MAN AND A CHOLERIC SO INSTEAD OF RESPONDING TO THIS OPEN HEARTED SALUTATION IN A KINDRED SPIRIT HE GAVE THE LITTLE WICKET A TREMENDOUS SHAKE
STRETCHED OUT IN FLATS BENEATH A SKY OF PALE SOFT GREEN ALL DARK OBJECTS ON THE EARTH THAT LAY TOWARDS THE SUN WERE OVERSPREAD BY A PURPLE HAZE AGAINST WHICH GROUPS OF WAILING GNATS SHONE OUT
AND WILL RETREAT WITH THIS PASTY TO THE BROOK THERE
TO KEEP THE PARISH OFFICERS A WAITING AT YOUR GARDEN GATE WHEN THEY COME HERE UPON POROCHIAL BUSINESS WITH THE POROCHIAL ORPHANS ARE YOU AWEER MISSUS MANN THAT YOU ARE AS I MAY SAY A POROCHIAL DELEGATE AND A STIPENDIARY I'M SURE MISTER BUMBLE
HEAD TURNED TO ONE SIDE ARMS HANGING LIMP AND LEGS TWISTED UNDER HIM AFTER A LONG LONG LOOK PINOCCHIO SAID TO HIMSELF WITH GREAT CONTENT HOW RIDICULOUS I WAS AS A MARIONETTE
HE WAS WORN OUT FROM HUNGER AND TOO MUCH WORK AFTER LOOKING AT HIM A LONG TIME HE SAID TO HIMSELF I KNOW THAT DONKEY
OH HO WHERE IS THE OWNER OF THE HUT CRIED PINOCCHIO VERY MUCH SURPRISED HERE I AM UP HERE FATHER AND SON LOOKED UP TO THE CEILING AND THERE ON A BEAM SAT THE TALKING CRICKET OH MY DEAR CRICKET
IF HE IS NOT DEAD THEN HE IS SURELY ALIVE
AND SHOWED HIM HOW TO DRAW THE WATER PINOCCHIO SET TO WORK AS WELL AS HE KNEW HOW BUT LONG BEFORE HE HAD PULLED UP THE ONE HUNDRED BUCKETS HE WAS TIRED OUT AND DRIPPING WITH PERSPIRATION HE HAD NEVER WORKED SO HARD IN HIS LIFE
REMEMBER THE OLD PROVERB WHOEVER STEALS HIS NEIGHBOR'S SHIRT USUALLY DIES WITHOUT HIS OWN
FATHER AND SON WERE REALLY ABOUT TO DROWN WHEN THEY HEARD A VOICE LIKE A GUITAR OUT OF TUNE CALL FROM THE SEA WHAT IS THE TROUBLE IT IS I AND MY POOR FATHER I KNOW THE VOICE YOU ARE PINOCCHIO
PINOCCHIO OFFERED HIS ARM TO GEPPETTO WHO WAS SO WEAK HE COULD HARDLY STAND AND SAID TO HIM LEAN ON MY ARM DEAR FATHER AND LET US GO WE WILL WALK VERY VERY SLOWLY AND IF WE FEEL TIRED WE CAN REST BY THE WAYSIDE
NOT ADDING ANOTHER WORD PINOCCHIO TOOK THE CANDLE IN HIS HAND AND GOING AHEAD TO LIGHT THE WAY HE SAID TO HIS FATHER FOLLOW ME AND HAVE NO FEAR THEY WALKED A LONG DISTANCE THROUGH THE STOMACH AND THE WHOLE BODY OF THE SHARK WHEN THEY REACHED THE THROAT OF THE MONSTER THEY STOPPED FOR A WHILE
WHEN THE JUDGE HEARD I HAD BEEN ROBBED HE SENT ME TO JAIL TO MAKE THE THIEVES HAPPY AND WHEN I CAME AWAY I SAW A FINE BUNCH OF GRAPES HANGING ON A VINE THE TRAP CAUGHT ME AND THE FARMER PUT A COLLAR ON ME AND MADE ME A WATCHDOG
MY DONKEY HAS DRAWN THE WATER FOR ME BUT NOW THAT POOR ANIMAL IS DYING WILL YOU TAKE ME TO SEE HIM SAID PINOCCHIO GLADLY AS SOON AS PINOCCHIO WENT INTO THE STABLE HE SPIED A LITTLE DONKEY LYING ON A BED OF STRAW IN THE CORNER OF THE STABLE
DEAR FRIEND YOU HAVE SAVED MY FATHER AND I HAVE NOT ENOUGH WORDS WITH WHICH TO THANK YOU ALLOW ME TO EMBRACE YOU AS A SIGN OF MY ETERNAL GRATITUDE THE TUNNY STUCK HIS NOSE OUT OF THE WATER AND PINOCCHIO KNELT ON THE SAND AND KISSED HIM MOST AFFECTIONATELY ON HIS CHEEK
WHEN PINOCCHIO RETURNED HOME HIS FATHER ASKED HIM AND WHERE IS THE NEW SUIT I COULDN'T FIND ONE TO FIT ME I SHALL HAVE TO LOOK AGAIN SOME OTHER DAY THAT NIGHT PINOCCHIO INSTEAD OF GOING TO BED AT TEN O'CLOCK WAITED UNTIL MIDNIGHT
SAID PINOCCHIO BOWING POLITELY
I AM GOING TO THE MARKET PLACE TO BUY MYSELF A COAT A CAP AND A PAIR OF SHOES WHEN I COME BACK I'LL BE SO DRESSED UP YOU WILL THINK I AM A RICH MAN HE RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND UP THE ROAD TO THE VILLAGE LAUGHING AND SINGING SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIS NAME CALLED
THAT HE ALMOST DROPPED IN A FAINT HE WANTED TO LAUGH HE WANTED TO CRY HE WANTED TO SAY A THOUSAND AND ONE THINGS BUT ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO STAND STILL STUTTERING AND STAMMERING BROKENLY AT LAST WITH A GREAT EFFORT
AND ANSWERED IN THE SAME TONGUE I AM LAMP WICK THEN HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND DIED OH MY POOR LAMP WICK SAID PINOCCHIO IN A FAINT VOICE AS HE WIPED HIS EYES WITH SOME STRAW HE HAD PICKED UP FROM THE GROUND
HE NOTICED A LARGE SNAIL CRAWLING OUT OF SOME BUSHES DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME SAID THE SNAIL YES AND NO DO YOU REMEMBER THE SNAIL THAT LIVED WITH THE FAIRY WITH AZURE HAIR DO YOU NOT REMEMBER HOW SHE OPENED THE DOOR FOR YOU ONE NIGHT AND GAVE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT
I RAN AWAY TO THE MARIONETTE THEATER AND THE PROPRIETOR CAUGHT ME AND WANTED TO BURN ME TO COOK HIS ROAST LAMB HE WAS THE ONE WHO GAVE ME THE FIVE GOLD PIECES FOR YOU
EATING LIVE FISH THEY WRIGGLED SO THAT NOW AND AGAIN ONE OF THEM SLIPPED OUT OF THE OLD MAN'S MOUTH AND ESCAPED INTO THE DARKNESS UNDER THE TABLE AT THIS SIGHT THE POOR MARIONETTE WAS FILLED WITH SUCH GREAT AND SUDDEN HAPPINESS
YOU HAD DONKEYS IN YOUR SCHOOL HOW YOU MUST HAVE STUDIED THE MARIONETTE ASHAMED AND HURT BY THOSE WORDS DID NOT ANSWER BUT TAKING HIS GLASS OF MILK RETURNED TO HIS FATHER FROM THAT DAY ON FOR MORE THAN FIVE MONTHS
HE FOUND OUT I WAS INNOCENT WHEN I CAUGHT THE WEASELS AND HE LET ME GO
WE ARE OLD TIRED AND SICK SICK REPEATED THE CAT ADDIO FALSE FRIENDS ANSWERED THE MARIONETTE YOU CHEATED ME ONCE BUT YOU WILL NEVER CATCH ME AGAIN BELIEVE US TODAY WE ARE TRULY POOR AND STARVING
ANSWERED THE OLD MAN RUBBING HIS EYES ARE YOU REALLY MY OWN DEAR PINOCCHIO YES YES YES IT IS I LOOK AT ME AND YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME HAVEN'T YOU OH MY DEAR FATHER HOW GOOD YOU ARE AND TO THINK THAT I
HE THREW THEM AROUND THE OLD MAN'S NECK
IF YOU HAVE NO PENNY I HAVE NO MILK TOO BAD SAID PINOCCHIO AND STARTED TO GO WAIT A MOMENT SAID FARMER JOHN PERHAPS WE CAN COME TO TERMS DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DRAW WATER FROM A WELL I CAN TRY
AS HE LOOKED UP THROUGH THE OPEN JAWS OF HIS NEW HOME THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO ESCAPE HE WHISPERED TURNING TO HIS FATHER THE SHARK IS FAST ASLEEP THE SEA IS CALM AND THE NIGHT IS AS BRIGHT AS DAY FOLLOW ME CLOSELY DEAR FATHER AND WE SHALL SOON BE SAVED
THERE HE FOUND A NEW SUIT A NEW HAT AND A PAIR OF SHOES AS SOON AS HE WAS DRESSED HE PUT HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS AND PULLED OUT A LITTLE LEATHER PURSE ON WHICH WERE WRITTEN THE FOLLOWING WORDS THE FAIRY WITH AZURE HAIR RETURNS
BUT HOW COULD I THE SEA WAS ROUGH AND THE WHITECAPS OVERTURNED THE BOAT THEN A TERRIBLE SHARK CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA AND AS SOON AS HE SAW ME IN THE WATER SWAM QUICKLY TOWARD ME PUT OUT HIS TONGUE AND SWALLOWED ME AS EASILY AS IF I HAD BEEN A CHOCOLATE PEPPERMINT
TOWARD THE FAINT LIGHT WHICH GLOWED IN THE DISTANCE AS HE WALKED HIS FEET SPLASHED IN A POOL OF GREASY AND SLIPPERY WATER WHICH HAD SUCH A HEAVY SMELL OF FISH FRIED IN OIL THAT PINOCCHIO THOUGHT IT WAS LENT THE FARTHER ON HE WENT THE BRIGHTER AND CLEARER GREW THE TINY LIGHT
SEEM TO HAVE BEEN MADE FOR EACH OTHER AND IT APPEARS AS IF IT WAS THE DESIGN OF PROVIDENCE THAT AN INHERITANCE SO PROPER AND CONVENIENT FOR A BAND OF BRETHREN UNITED TO EACH OTHER BY THE STRONGEST TIES SHOULD NEVER BE SPLIT INTO A NUMBER OF UNSOCIAL
OR SEDUCED BY A TOO GREAT FONDNESS FOR PEACE TO DECLINE HAZARDING THEIR TRANQUILLITY AND PRESENT SAFETY FOR THE SAKE OF NEIGHBORS OF WHOM PERHAPS THEY HAVE BEEN JEALOUS AND WHOSE IMPORTANCE THEY ARE CONTENT TO SEE DIMINISHED
IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT JEALOUSIES AND UNEASINESSES MAY GRADUALLY SLIDE INTO THE MINDS AND CABINETS OF OTHER NATIONS AND THAT WE ARE NOT TO EXPECT THAT THEY SHOULD REGARD OUR ADVANCEMENT IN UNION IN POWER AND CONSEQUENCE BY LAND AND BY SEA
NOT ONLY MANY OF THE OFFICERS OF GOVERNMENT WHO OBEYED THE DICTATES OF PERSONAL INTEREST BUT OTHERS FROM A MISTAKEN ESTIMATE OF CONSEQUENCES OR THE UNDUE INFLUENCE OF FORMER ATTACHMENTS
ALTHOUGH SUCH CONDUCT WOULD NOT BE WISE IT WOULD NEVERTHELESS BE NATURAL THE HISTORY OF THE STATES OF GREECE AND OF OTHER COUNTRIES ABOUNDS WITH SUCH INSTANCES AND IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT WHAT HAS SO OFTEN HAPPENED WOULD
WE OUGHT TO SEEK IT IN A DIVISION OF THE STATES INTO DISTINCT CONFEDERACIES OR SOVEREIGNTIES HOWEVER EXTRAORDINARY THIS NEW DOCTRINE MAY APPEAR IT NEVERTHELESS HAS ITS ADVOCATES AND CERTAIN CHARACTERS WHO WERE MUCH OPPOSED TO IT FORMERLY
WHICH THE MAGNITUDE AND IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT DEMAND AND WHICH IT CERTAINLY OUGHT TO RECEIVE BUT THIS AS WAS REMARKED IN THE FOREGOING NUMBER OF THIS PAPER IS MORE TO BE WISHED THAN EXPECTED THAT IT MAY BE SO CONSIDERED AND EXAMINED
BECAUSE THE CHEAPNESS AND EXCELLENCE OF OUR PRODUCTIONS ADDED TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF VICINITY AND THE ENTERPRISE AND ADDRESS OF OUR MERCHANTS AND NAVIGATORS WILL GIVE US A GREATER SHARE IN THE ADVANTAGES WHICH THOSE TERRITORIES AFFORD
WHICH IS MORE COMMONLY THE FAULT OF THE HEAD THAN OF THE HEART WILL BE REPRESENTED AS MERE PRETENSE AND ARTIFICE THE STALE BAIT FOR POPULARITY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PUBLIC GOOD IT WILL BE FORGOTTEN ON THE ONE HAND THAT JEALOUSY IS THE USUAL CONCOMITANT OF LOVE
THAN UNDER THE FORBIDDEN APPEARANCE OF ZEAL FOR THE FIRMNESS AND EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNMENT HISTORY WILL TEACH US THAT THE FORMER HAS BEEN FOUND A MUCH MORE CERTAIN ROAD TO THE INTRODUCTION OF DESPOTISM THAN THE LATTER
IN SUCH A SITUATION AS NOT TO INVITE HOSTILITY OR INSULT FOR IT NEED NOT BE OBSERVED THAT THERE ARE PRETENDED AS WELL AS JUST CAUSES OF WAR IT IS TOO TRUE HOWEVER DISGRACEFUL IT MAY BE TO HUMAN NATURE
AND THAT WHENEVER SUCH INDUCEMENTS MAY FIND FIT TIME AND OPPORTUNITY FOR OPERATION PRETENSES TO COLOR AND JUSTIFY THEM WILL NOT BE WANTING WISELY THEREFORE DO THEY CONSIDER UNION AND A GOOD NATIONAL GOVERNMENT
THAN THE ALTERNATIVE OF AN ADOPTION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION OR A DISMEMBERMENT OF THE UNION IT WILL THEREFORE BE OF USE TO BEGIN BY EXAMINING THE ADVANTAGES OF THAT UNION
AND THEREFORE THAT IT WAS NOT LESS THEIR INCLINATION THAN THEIR DUTY TO RECOMMEND ONLY SUCH MEASURES AS AFTER THE MOST MATURE DELIBERATION THEY REALLY THOUGHT PRUDENT AND ADVISABLE
AMERICA WILL HAVE REASON TO EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE POET FAREWELL A LONG FAREWELL TO ALL MY GREATNESS
RESORT TO SEPARATE CONFEDERACIES OF DISTINCT PORTIONS OF THE WHOLE
FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER SEVENTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN JAY TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
IF ONE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAD NOT CALLED FORTH ALL THE NATIONAL MEANS AND MATERIALS FOR FORMING FLEETS THEIR PROWESS AND THEIR THUNDER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CELEBRATED LET ENGLAND HAVE ITS NAVIGATION AND FLEET
MY LAST PAPER ASSIGNED SEVERAL REASONS WHY THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE WOULD BE BEST SECURED BY UNION AGAINST THE DANGER IT MAY BE EXPOSED TO BY JUST CAUSES OF WAR GIVEN TO OTHER NATIONS
OR WHOSE AMBITION AIMED AT OBJECTS WHICH DID NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE PUBLIC GOOD WERE INDEFATIGABLE IN THEIR EFFORTS TO PERSUADE THE PEOPLE TO REJECT THE ADVICE OF THAT PATRIOTIC CONGRESS MANY INDEED WERE DECEIVED AND DELUDED
HAVE INVARIABLY JOINED WITH THE PEOPLE IN THINKING THAT THE PROSPERITY OF AMERICA DEPENDED ON ITS UNION TO PRESERVE AND PERPETUATE IT WAS THE GREAT OBJECT OF THE PEOPLE IN FORMING THAT CONVENTION
BY ANY IMPRESSIONS OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH MAY RESULT FROM THE EVIDENCE OF TRUTH YOU WILL NO DOUBT AT THE SAME TIME HAVE COLLECTED FROM THE GENERAL SCOPE OF THEM THAT THEY PROCEED FROM A SOURCE NOT UNFRIENDLY TO THE NEW CONSTITUTION
BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE REASONED AND DECIDED JUDICIOUSLY AND HAPPY THEY ARE IN REFLECTING THAT THEY DID SO THEY CONSIDERED THAT THE CONGRESS WAS COMPOSED OF MANY WISE AND EXPERIENCED MEN THAT
WOULD THOSE THREE GOVERNMENTS IF THEY AGREED AT ALL BE ABLE WITH ALL THEIR RESPECTIVE FORCES TO OPERATE AGAINST THE ENEMY SO EFFECTUALLY AS THE SINGLE GOVERNMENT OF GREAT BRITAIN WOULD WE HAVE HEARD MUCH OF THE FLEETS OF BRITAIN
IN THE PROGRESS OF THIS DISCUSSION I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO GIVE A SATISFACTORY ANSWER TO ALL THE OBJECTIONS WHICH SHALL HAVE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE THAT MAY SEEM TO HAVE ANY CLAIM TO YOUR ATTENTION
A PEOPLE DESCENDED FROM THE SAME ANCESTORS SPEAKING THE SAME LANGUAGE PROFESSING THE SAME RELIGION ATTACHED TO THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT VERY SIMILAR IN THEIR MANNERS AND CUSTOMS AND WHO
IT MAY PERHAPS BE THOUGHT SUPERFLUOUS TO OFFER ARGUMENTS TO PROVE THE UTILITY OF THE UNION A POINT NO DOUBT DEEPLY ENGRAVED ON THE HEARTS OF THE GREAT BODY OF THE PEOPLE IN EVERY STATE AND ONE WHICH IT MAY BE IMAGINED
THAN CONSISTS WITH THE WISHES OR POLICY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SOVEREIGNS SPAIN THINKS IT CONVENIENT TO SHUT THE MISSISSIPPI AGAINST US ON THE ONE SIDE AND BRITAIN EXCLUDES US FROM THE SAINT LAWRENCE ON THE OTHER
THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT VIEW FROM THE GARDEN WHICH IS AT THE HEIGHT OF AN ORDINARY FIRST FLOOR ON THE LEFT THE AQUEDUCT OF MARLY CLOSES IN THE HORIZON
ARMAND ORDER AN OPEN CARRIAGE AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER WE WERE AT WIDOW ARNOULD'S PERHAPS YOU KNOW THE INN WHICH IS A HOTEL ON WEEK DAYS AND A TEA GARDEN ON SUNDAYS
UNDER THE PRETEXT THAT SHE WAS ASLEEP AND HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT SHE WAS NOT TO BE AWAKENED THE HABIT OR THE NEED OF SEEING ME WHICH MARGUERITE HAD NOW CONTRACTED HAD THIS GOOD RESULT THAT IT FORCED ME TO LEAVE THE GAMING TABLE JUST AT THE MOMENT
FOR TWO MONTHS WE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TO PARIS NO ONE CAME TO SEE US EXCEPT PRUDENCE AND JULIE DUPRAT OF WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU
BEYOND DISTINCT IN THE SUNLIGHT RISE LITTLE WHITE HOUSES WITH RED ROOFS AND MANUFACTORIES WHICH AT THAT DISTANCE PUT AN ADMIRABLE FINISH TO THE LANDSCAPE BEYOND THAT PARIS IN THE MIST
MY DREAM VANISHED AT THE LAST WORDS OF PRUDENCE AND BROUGHT ME BACK TO REALITY SO BRUTALLY THAT I WAS STILL STUNNED WITH THE FALL
FAR THAT MY MISTRESS NOW BELONGED TO ME MORE COMPLETELY AND MY DREAM WAS AT LENGTH REALIZED MARGUERITE COULD NOT BE WITHOUT ME NOT CARING WHAT THE RESULT MIGHT BE SHE PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED OUR LIAISON
HOWEVER MARGUERITE'S PLEASURE IN SEEING HER FRIENDS WAS A LITTLE MODERATED WHEN SHE SAW THE EXPENSE WHICH THAT PLEASURE ENTAILED AND ESPECIALLY THE NECESSITY SHE WAS SOMETIMES IN OF ASKING ME FOR MONEY THE DUKE
AND FOR WHOM ELSE SHOULD I BURY MYSELF HERE IF NOT FOR YOU WELL THEN MARGUERITE LET ME TAKE IT MYSELF YOU ARE MAD NOT ONLY IS IT UNNECESSARY BUT IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS
BY DAY IN THE LITTLE WOOD THAT COVERED THE HILLSIDE IN THE EVENING SEATED ON THE GRASS AND I ASKED MYSELF IF EARTHLY CREATURES HAD EVER BEEN SO HAPPY AS WE SHOULD BE WHAT A PRETTY HOUSE MARGUERITE SAID TO ME
WE SENT FOR PRUDENCE AND ALL THREE SET OFF AFTER MARGUERITE HAD GIVEN NANINE ORDERS TO TELL THE DUKE THAT SHE HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE FINE DAY
I PASSED WHOLE DAYS AT THE FEET OF MY MISTRESS WE OPENED THE WINDOWS UPON THE GARDEN AND AS WE WATCHED THE SUMMER RIPENING IN ITS FLOWERS
COVERING HER HANDS WITH TEARS IN MY JOY AT BEING THUS LOVED MY LIFE IS YOURS MARGUERITE YOU NEED THIS MAN NO LONGER AM I NOT HERE SHALL I EVER LEAVE YOU AND CAN I EVER REPAY YOU FOR THE HAPPINESS THAT YOU GIVE ME
MY EXPENSES WERE VERY MODERATE ONLY I USED UP MY YEAR'S INCOME IN EIGHT MONTHS AND SPENT THE FOUR SUMMER MONTHS WITH MY FATHER WHICH PRACTICALLY GAVE ME TWELVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR AND IN ADDITION THE REPUTATION OF A GOOD SON
AND I WILL NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT I AM LIVING WITH HIM IT IS FOLLY NO DOUBT BUT I LOVE HIM WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO AND THEN NOW THAT HE HAS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE ALWAYS WITH ME
AS PRUDENCE HAD TOLD US IT WAS THE REAL COUNTRY AND I MUST ADD IT WAS A REAL LUNCH IT IS NOT ONLY OUT OF GRATITUDE FOR THE HAPPINESS I OWE IT
THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL HER AND I HAD LISTENED AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM INTO WHICH THEY HAD SHUT THEMSELVES NOT LONG AFTER PRUDENCE RETURNED AGAIN I WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE GARDEN WHEN SHE ARRIVED AND SHE DID NOT SEE ME
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SPEAK TO ARMAND MARGUERITE SEEMED TO BE THINKING FOR SHE ANSWERED NOTHING MY HEART BEAT VIOLENTLY WHILE I WAITED FOR HER REPLY NO SHE ANSWERED I WILL NOT LEAVE ARMAND
WELL SAID MARGUERITE WELL I HAVE SEEN THE DUKE WHAT DID HE SAY THAT HE WOULD GLADLY FORGIVE YOU IN REGARD TO THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE
AND FEARING LEST SHE SHOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN I POSSESSED I BORROWED AT PARIS A SUM EQUAL TO THAT WHICH I HAD ALREADY BORROWED AND PAID BACK I WAS THEN ONCE MORE IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WITHOUT RECKONING MY ALLOWANCE
WHEN AN ADROIT GAMBLER WOULD HAVE LEFT IT SETTLING ONE THING AGAINST ANOTHER I FOUND MYSELF IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS
I FLUNG MYSELF INTO THIS RAPID NOISY AND VOLCANIC LIFE WHICH HAD FORMERLY TERRIFIED ME WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AND WHICH HAD BECOME FOR ME THE NECESSARY COMPLEMENT OF MY LOVE FOR MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE COULD I HAVE DONE
BE AT PRUDENCE'S TO NIGHT AT EIGHT
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN NEXT DAY MARGUERITE SENT ME AWAY VERY EARLY SAYING THAT THE DUKE WAS COMING AT AN EARLY HOUR AND PROMISING TO WRITE TO ME THE MOMENT HE WENT AND TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE EVENING
MARGUERITE GOT ACCUSTOMED TO THIS NEW EXISTENCE WHOSE SALUTARY EFFECTS SHE ALREADY REALIZED SHE BEGAN TO SPEND SOME OF HER EVENINGS AT HOME OR IF THE WEATHER WAS FINE SHE WRAPPED HERSELF IN A SHAWL PUT ON A VEIL AND WE WENT ON FOOT
MARGUERITE WAS AWAKENED BY THE SUNLIGHT POURING INTO HER ROOM AND JUMPING OUT OF BED ASKED ME IF I WOULD TAKE HER INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE WHOLE DAY
MARGUERITE WAS DRESSED IN WHITE SHE LEANED ON MY ARM SAYING OVER TO ME AGAIN UNDER THE STARRY SKY THE WORDS SHE HAD SAID TO ME THE DAY BEFORE AND FAR OFF THE WORLD WENT ON ITS WAY
THOUGH I WAS HALF INCLINED TO SO MUCH DID I PITY HIM BUT I WAS AFRAID LEST IF I SO ADVISED HER SHE SHOULD THINK THAT I WISHED THE DUKE NOT MERELY TO COME AND SEE HER AGAIN BUT TO TAKE OVER THE EXPENSES OF THE HOUSE
AND BY THIS I KNEW THE VIOLENCE OF MY LOVE I LEFT THE TABLE WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION WHETHER I WAS WINNING OR LOSING PITYING THOSE WHOM I LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT LIKE ME FIND THEIR REAL HAPPINESS IN LEAVING IT
WE LEFT THE HOUSE AND STARTED ON OUR RETURN TO PARIS TALKING OVER THE NEW PLAN
THOUGH THEY HAD ROASTED HIM ALIVE BUT NOW WHEN THERE WERE NONE TO SEE OR HEAR HIM HE FELL UPON HIS KNEES ON THE FLOOR AND HIDING HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS WEPT SUCH TEARS
REPLIED THE BEADLE AND THE COCKED HAT AND CANE HAVING BEEN BY THIS TIME ADJUSTED TO THEIR OWNER'S SATISFACTION MISTER BUMBLE AND NOAH CLAYPOLE BETOOK THEMSELVES WITH ALL SPEED TO THE UNDERTAKER'S SHOP
WHEN THE BREAKFAST WAS CLEARED AWAY THE MERRY OLD GENTLMAN AND THE TWO BOYS PLAYED AT A VERY CURIOUS AND UNCOMMON GAME WHICH WAS PERFORMED IN THIS WAY THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN PLACING A SNUFF BOX IN ONE POCKET OF HIS TROUSERS
HE WOULD STOP EVERY NOW AND THEN TO LISTEN WHEN THERE WAS THE LEAST NOISE BELOW AND WHEN HE HAD SATISFIED HIMSELF HE WOULD GO ON WHISTLING AND STIRRING AGAIN AS BEFORE ALTHOUGH OLIVER HAD ROUSED HIMSELF FROM SLEEP HE WAS NOT THOROUGHLY AWAKE
EXCLAIMED MISSUS SOWERBERRY MEAT MA'AM MEAT
HE HAD LISTENED TO THEIR TAUNTS WITH A LOOK OF CONTEMPT HE HAD BORNE THE LASH WITHOUT A CRY FOR HE FELT THAT PRIDE SWELLING IN HIS HEART WHICH WOULD HAVE KEPT DOWN A SHRIEK TO THE LAST
WHEN THIS GAME HAD BEEN PLAYED A GREAT MANY TIMES A COUPLE OF YOUNG LADIES CALLED TO SEE THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN ONE OF WHOM WAS NAMED BET AND THE OTHER NANCY THEY WORE A GOOD DEAL OF HAIR NOT VERY NEATLY TURNED UP BEHIND AND WERE RATHER UNTIDY ABOUT THE SHOES AND STOCKINGS
WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS CHAPTER TO DO HIM JUSTICE HE WAS AS FAR AS HIS POWER WENT IT WAS NOT VERY EXTENSIVE KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS THE BOY PERHAPS BECAUSE IT WAS HIS INTEREST TO BE SO
HE HAD COME A LONG WAY THOUGH AND SHOULD LOSE A GREAT DEAL OF TIME BY DOING SO BESIDES IT WAS SO EARLY THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FEAR OF HIS BEING SEEN SO HE WALKED ON HE REACHED THE HOUSE
I WASN'T ABLE TO SLEEP ANY LONGER SIR REPLIED OLIVER MEEKLY
CHANGED THE SUBJECT BY ASKING WHETHER THERE HAD BEEN MUCH OF A CROWD AT THE EXECUTION THAT MORNING THIS MADE HIM WONDER MORE AND MORE
THE JEW TOOK OUT ANOTHER SO SMALL THAT IT LAY IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME VERY MINUTE INSCRIPTION ON IT FOR THE JEW LAID IT FLAT UPON THE TABLE AND SHADING IT WITH HIS HAND PORED OVER IT LONG AND EARNESTLY
AT THE CELLAR DOOR THE ACCOUNTS OF HIS FEROCITY AS RELATED BY MISSUS SOWERBERRY AND CHARLOTTE WERE OF SO STARTLING A NATURE
SAID THE JEW STOPPING SHORT YES SIR SAID OLIVER SEE IF YOU CAN TAKE IT OUT WITHOUT MY FEELING IT AS YOU SAW THEM DO WHEN WE WERE AT PLAY THIS MORNING OLIVER HELD UP THE BOTTOM OF THE POCKET WITH ONE HAND
SAID THE PLAYFUL OLD GENTLEMAN PATTING OLIVER ON THE HEAD APPROVINGLY I NEVER SAW A SHARPER LAD HERE'S A SHILLING FOR YOU
SHE DESERVED WHAT HE SAID AND WORSE SHE DIDN'T SAID OLIVER SHE DID SAID MISSUS SOWERBERRY IT'S A LIE SAID OLIVER MISSUS SOWERBERRY BURST INTO A FLOOD OF TEARS
FOR IT WAS PLAIN FROM THE REPLIES OF THE TWO BOYS THAT THEY HAD BOTH BEEN THERE AND OLIVER NATURALLY WONDERED HOW THEY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE FOUND TIME TO BE SO VERY INDUSTRIOUS
AT LAST THE DODGER TROD UPON HIS TOES OR RAN UPON HIS BOOT ACCIDENTLY WHILE CHARLEY BATES STUMBLED UP AGAINST HIM BEHIND AND IN THAT ONE MOMENT THEY TOOK FROM HIM WITH THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY
AND THEY WON'T NEGLECT IT IF THEY DO MY DEAR DEPEND UPON IT MAKE EM YOUR MODELS MY DEAR MAKE EM YOUR MODELS TAPPING THE FIRE SHOVEL ON THE HEARTH TO ADD FORCE TO HIS WORDS DO EVERYTHING THEY BID YOU
AND WHEN HE WAS PULLED OUT OF HIS PRISON HE SCOWLED BOLDLY ON NOAH AND LOOKED QUITE UNDISMAYED
OLIVER'S CLOTHES HAD BEEN TORN IN THE BEATING HE HAD RECEIVED HIS FACE WAS BRUISED AND SCRATCHED AND HIS HAIR SCATTERED OVER HIS FOREHEAD THE ANGRY FLUSH HAD NOT DISAPPEARED HOWEVER
THERE IS A DROWSY STATE BETWEEN SLEEPING AND WAKING WHEN YOU DREAM MORE IN FIVE MINUTES WITH YOUR EYES HALF OPEN
AND SURVEYED WITH EQUAL PLEASURE BESIDES RINGS BROOCHES BRACELETS AND OTHER ARTICLES OF JEWELLERY OF SUCH MAGNIFICENT MATERIALS AND COSTLY WORKMANSHIP THAT OLIVER HAD NO IDEA EVEN OF THEIR NAMES HAVING REPLACED THESE TRINKETS
OF COURSE I KNOW THAT MY DEAR I ONLY TRIED TO FRIGHTEN YOU
WHEN THE COFFEE WAS DONE THE JEW DREW THE SAUCEPAN TO THE HOB STANDING THEN IN AN IRRESOLUTE ATTITUDE FOR A FEW MINUTES AS IF HE DID NOT WELL KNOW HOW TO EMPLOY HIMSELF HE TURNED ROUND AND LOOKED AT OLIVER AND CALLED HIM BY HIS NAME
IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID OLIVER
AND AT NIGHT MISSUS SOWERBERRY AFTER MAKING VARIOUS REMARKS OUTSIDE THE DOOR BY NO MEANS COMPLIMENTARY TO THE MEMORY OF HIS MOTHER
THERE WAS NO APPEARANCE OF ITS INMATES STIRRING AT THAT EARLY HOUR OLIVER STOPPED AND PEEPED INTO THE GARDEN A CHILD WAS WEEDING ONE OF THE LITTLE BEDS AS HE STOPPED HE RAISED HIS PALE FACE
AND RENDERED MISTER BUMBLE'S SUBSEQUENT APPLICATION OF THE PAROCHIAL CANE RATHER UNNECESSARY FOR THE REST OF THE DAY HE WAS SHUT UP IN THE BACK KITCHEN IN COMPANY WITH A PUMP AND A SLICE OF BREAD
AND YOUR SENSES WRAPT IN PERFECT UNCONSCIOUSNESS AT SUCH TIME A MORTAL KNOWS JUST ENOUGH OF WHAT HIS MIND IS DOING TO FORM SOME GLIMMERING CONCEPTION OF ITS MIGHTY POWERS
PERHAPS BECAUSE HIS WIFE DISLIKED HIM THE FLOOD OF TEARS HOWEVER LEFT HIM NO RESOURCE SO HE AT ONCE GAVE HIM A DRUBBING WHICH SATISFIED EVEN MISSUS SOWERBERRY HERSELF
SAID THE JEW SHRUGGING UP HIS SHOULDERS AND DISTORTING EVERY FEATURE WITH A HIDEOUS GRIN CLEVER DOGS CLEVER DOGS STAUNCH TO THE LAST NEVER TOLD THE OLD PARSON WHERE THEY WERE NEVER POACHED UPON OLD FAGIN
HE HAD OF COURSE BEEN IMPATIENT UNDER THE ORDEAL OF THIS SPEECH IT HAD NOT BEEN QUITE WHAT HE EXPECTED AND HE HAD BORNE IT WITH AN AIR OF IRRITATION
THEY CARED FOR NOTHING AND IDLED ME INTO A FIT OF SICKNESS BUT MY FIRST MATE WAS A GOOD EXCELLENT MAN WITH NO MORE IDEA OF BEING FROZEN IN THERE UNTIL SPRING THAN I HAD SO
WE'RE ALL TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND GOING BACK YEAR BY YEAR OH NO CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE I HOPE NOT SAID I TRYING TO SOOTHE HIS FEELINGS THERE WAS A SILENCE IN THE SCHOOLHOUSE
JEST THINK AS IF I WAS A WATCHIN YEH
HE SUSPECTED THEM TO BE IMPOSSIBLE PICTURES
AND SO IT PROVED SHE HAD BEEN AN EXCELLENT VESSEL IN HER DAY OF THE COWARDS ABOARD HER I CAN'T SAY SO MUCH THEN YOU WERE WRECKED I ASKED AS HE MADE A LONG PAUSE
SUCH WOULD BE NO MORE HE HAD SAID MEN WERE BETTER OR MORE TIMID SECULAR AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION HAD EFFACED THE THROAT GRAPPLING INSTINCT OR ELSE FIRM FINANCE HELD IN CHECK THE PASSIONS
THE ARMY AWAKENED AND BEGAN TO TREMBLE WITH EAGERNESS AT THE NOISE OF RUMORS IT CAST ITS EYES UPON THE ROADS WHICH WERE GROWING FROM LONG TROUGHS OF LIQUID MUD TO PROPER THOROUGHFARES
BUT YOU CAN'T BET ON NOTHING OF COURSE
THEY PERSISTENTLY YELLED FRESH FISH AT HIM AND WERE IN NO WISE TO BE TRUSTED HOWEVER HE PERCEIVED NOW THAT IT DID NOT GREATLY MATTER WHAT KIND OF SOLDIERS HE WAS GOING TO FIGHT SO LONG AS THEY FOUGHT WHICH FACT NO ONE DISPUTED
THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO MINGLE IN ONE OF THOSE GREAT AFFAIRS OF THE EARTH HE HAD OF COURSE DREAMED OF BATTLES ALL HIS LIFE OF VAGUE AND BLOODY CONFLICTS THAT HAD THRILLED HIM WITH THEIR SWEEP AND FIRE IN VISIONS HE HAD SEEN HIMSELF IN MANY STRUGGLES
HE WAS A SLIGHTLY RAGGED MAN WHO SPAT SKILLFULLY BETWEEN HIS SHOES AND POSSESSED A GREAT FUND OF BLAND AND INFANTILE ASSURANCE THE YOUTH LIKED HIM PERSONALLY YANK THE OTHER HAD INFORMED HIM
AND HE HAD LONGED TO SEE IT ALL HIS BUSY MIND HAD DRAWN FOR HIM LARGE PICTURES EXTRAVAGANT IN COLOR LURID WITH BREATHLESS DEEDS BUT HIS MOTHER HAD DISCOURAGED HIM
BEATING UPON IT MADE IT GLOW A LIGHT YELLOW SHADE A SMALL WINDOW SHOT AN OBLIQUE SQUARE OF WHITER LIGHT UPON THE CLUTTERED FLOOR THE SMOKE FROM THE FIRE AT TIMES NEGLECTED THE CLAY CHIMNEY AND WREATHED INTO THE ROOM AND THIS FLIMSY CHIMNEY OF CLAY AND STICKS
BEGAN THE LOUD SOLDIER WITH SCORN THE OTHER TURNED SAVAGELY UPON HIM THEY HAD A RAPID ALTERCATION IN WHICH THEY FASTENED UPON EACH OTHER VARIOUS STRANGE EPITHETS THE YOUTH AT LAST INTERRUPTED THEM DID YOU EVER THINK YOU MIGHT RUN YOURSELF JIM HE ASKED
THAT ALL OF THE UNTRIED MEN POSSESSED GREAT AND CORRECT CONFIDENCE HE NOW
IF SO BE A TIME COMES WHEN YEH HAVE TO BE KILT OF DO A MEAN THING WHY HENRY
AND WOULD NOT ANSWER THE RUDDER OR PROPERLY RESPOND TO THE MOST CAREFUL SETTING OF SAILS SO THERE WE WERE BLOWIN ALONG ANYWAYS HE COMPLAINED
MA I'VE ENLISTED HE HAD SAID TO HER DIFFIDENTLY THERE WAS A SHORT SILENCE THE LORD'S WILL BE DONE HENRY SHE HAD FINALLY REPLIED AND HAD THEN CONTINUED TO MILK THE BRINDLE COW
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER AND DARKER GIRL WHOM HE HAD GAZED AT STEADFASTLY AND HE THOUGHT SHE GREW DEMURE AND SAD AT SIGHT OF HIS BLUE AND BRASS
AS IF HE HAD SUFFERED FROM LONELINESS AND MISAPPREHENSION HE LOOKED WITH HIS CAREFUL PRECISION OF DRESS AS IF HE WERE THE OBJECT OF CHERISHING CARE ON THE PART OF ELDERLY UNMARRIED SISTERS
IT'S A LIE THAT'S ALL IT IS A THUNDERIN LIE SAID ANOTHER PRIVATE LOUDLY HIS SMOOTH FACE WAS FLUSHED
HE SAT LOOKING AT ME EXPECTANTLY I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT WITH HIS QUEER HEAD AND LENGTH OF THINNESS HE WAS MADE TO HOP ALONG THE ROAD OF LIFE
EXCEPT FROM A CHEAP UNPRINCIPLED NEWSPAPER IN THE OLD DAYS A GOOD PART O THE BEST MEN HERE KNEW A HUNDRED PORTS AND SOMETHING OF THE WAY FOLKS LIVED IN THEM THEY SAW THE WORLD FOR THEMSELVES
ONE OF THE GREATEST DISCOVERIES THAT MAN HAS EVER MADE NOW WE WERE APPROACHING DANGEROUS GROUND BUT A SUDDEN SENSE OF HIS SUFFERINGS AT THE HANDS OF THE IGNORANT CAME TO MY HELP AND I ASKED TO HEAR MORE WITH ALL THE DEFERENCE I REALLY FELT
THEY FANCY THAT THEY COMPREHEND THE UNIVERSE I SMILED AND WAITED FOR HIM TO GO ON
THE LOUD PRIVATE FOLLOWED THEY WERE WRANGLING THAT'S ALL RIGHT SAID THE TALL SOLDIER AS HE ENTERED HE WAVED HIS HAND EXPRESSIVELY
SAID THE LOUD ONE FROM A CORNER WELL REMARKED THE YOUTH LIKE AS NOT THIS STORY'LL TURN OUT
AND THE CREW DONE THEIR WORK BY DINT OF HARD DRIVING I BEGAN TO FIND THIS UNEXPECTED NARRATIVE A LITTLE DULL CAPTAIN LITTLEPAGE SPOKE WITH A KIND OF SLOW CORRECTNESS THAT LACKED THE LONGSHORE HIGH FLAVOR TO WHICH I HAD GROWN USED
THAT PERHAPS IN A BATTLE HE MIGHT RUN HE WAS FORCED TO ADMIT THAT AS FAR AS WAR WAS CONCERNED HE KNEW NOTHING OF HIMSELF
DON'T FORGIT ABOUT THE SOCKS AND THE SHIRTS CHILD AND I'VE PUT A CUP OF BLACKBERRY JAM WITH YER BUNDLE BECAUSE I KNOW YEH LIKE IT ABOVE ALL THINGS GOOD BY HENRY WATCH OUT AND BE A GOOD BOY
I'M GOING TO ENLIST HENRY DON'T YOU BE A FOOL HIS MOTHER HAD REPLIED SHE HAD THEN COVERED HER FACE WITH THE QUILT THERE WAS AN END TO THE MATTER FOR THAT NIGHT
MADE ENDLESS THREATS TO SET ABLAZE THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT
COMPANY'S SAKE IN DULL DAYS AND NIGHTS HE TURNS TO HIS BOOK MOST OF US OLD SHIPMASTERS CAME TO KNOW MOST EVERYTHING ABOUT SOMETHING
A THEORY OF SOCIAL RIGHTS THE LIKE OF WHICH PROBABLY NEVER BEFORE FOUND ITS WAY INTO DISTINCT LANGUAGE BEING NOTHING SHORT OF THIS THAT IT IS THE ABSOLUTE SOCIAL RIGHT OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL
EFFECTUAL SUMPTUARY LAW AND THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE UNION IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR A PERSON POSSESSING A VERY LARGE INCOME TO FIND ANY MODE OF SPENDING IT WHICH WILL NOT INCUR POPULAR DISAPPROBATION
IF WE DO NOT INTERFERE BENEVOLENTLY BY SHOWING INTEREST OR CONCERN FOR HIM IT IS FAR OTHERWISE IF HE HAS INFRINGED THE RULES NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY
NOR IS THERE ANYTHING WHICH TENDS MORE TO DISCREDIT AND FRUSTRATE THE BETTER MEANS OF INFLUENCING CONDUCT THAN A RESORT TO THE WORSE IF THERE BE AMONG THOSE WHOM IT IS ATTEMPTED TO COERCE INTO PRUDENCE OR TEMPERANCE ANY OF THE MATERIAL
I AM NOT WRITING AN ESSAY ON THE ABERRATIONS OF EXISTING MORAL FEELING THAT IS TOO WEIGHTY A SUBJECT TO BE DISCUSSED PARENTHETICALLY
BUT WHERE HAS THERE BEEN SEEN A PUBLIC WHICH SET ANY SUCH LIMIT TO ITS CENSORSHIP OR WHEN DOES THE PUBLIC TROUBLE ITSELF ABOUT UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE IN ITS INTERFERENCES WITH PERSONAL CONDUCT IT IS SELDOM THINKING OF ANYTHING
IT MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE ESTABLISHMENT BY CUSTOM OF A HOLIDAY ON SOME OTHER DAY OF THE WEEK FOR THOSE PARTICULAR CLASSES OF PERSONS THE ONLY GROUND THEREFORE ON WHICH RESTRICTIONS ON SUNDAY AMUSEMENTS CAN BE DEFENDED MUST BE THAT THEY ARE RELIGIOUSLY WRONG
WE ARE NOT BOUND FOR EXAMPLE TO SEEK HIS SOCIETY WE HAVE A RIGHT TO AVOID IT THOUGH NOT TO PARADE THE AVOIDANCE FOR WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE SOCIETY MOST ACCEPTABLE TO US
AND THAT NO ONE OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED THROUGH PIECEWORK OR OTHERWISE TO EARN BY SUPERIOR SKILL OR INDUSTRY MORE THAN OTHERS CAN WITHOUT IT AND THEY EMPLOY A MORAL POLICE WHICH OCCASIONALLY BECOMES A PHYSICAL ONE TO DETER SKILFUL WORKMEN FROM RECEIVING
WHEN ONCE IT THOROUGHLY SINKS INTO THE FEELINGS SEEMS ALWAYS TO EXCITE EVEN IN THOSE WHOSE PERSONAL HABITS ARE ANYTHING BUT SCRUPULOUSLY CLEANLY AND OF WHICH THE SENTIMENT OF RELIGIOUS IMPURITY SO INTENSE IN THE HINDOOS IS A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE
A RECENT WRITER IN SOME RESPECTS OF CONSIDERABLE MERIT PROPOSES TO USE HIS OWN WORDS NOT A CRUSADE BUT A CIVILIZADE AGAINST THIS POLYGAMOUS COMMUNITY
DISSIMULATION AND INSINCERITY IRASCIBILITY ON INSUFFICIENT CAUSE AND RESENTMENT DISPROPORTIONED TO THE PROVOCATION THE LOVE OF DOMINEERING OVER OTHERS THE DESIRE TO ENGROSS MORE THAN ONE'S SHARE OF ADVANTAGES
THE NEXT EXAMPLE HOWEVER SHALL BE TAKEN FROM AN INTERFERENCE WITH LIBERTY WHICH WE HAVE BY NO MEANS PASSED ALL DANGER OF WHEREVER THE PURITANS HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL AS IN NEW ENGLAND AND IN GREAT BRITAIN AT THE TIME OF THE COMMONWEALTH
TO BE FIXED ON SOME EQUITABLE PRINCIPLE OF THE LABOURS AND SACRIFICES INCURRED FOR DEFENDING THE SOCIETY OR ITS MEMBERS FROM INJURY AND MOLESTATION THESE CONDITIONS SOCIETY IS JUSTIFIED IN ENFORCING AT ALL COSTS TO THOSE WHO ENDEAVOUR TO WITHHOLD FULFILMENT
MERELY FROM WITHOUT IN THIS DEPARTMENT THEREFORE OF HUMAN AFFAIRS INDIVIDUALITY HAS ITS PROPER FIELD OF ACTION IN THE CONDUCT OF HUMAN BEINGS TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER IT IS NECESSARY THAT GENERAL RULES SHOULD FOR THE MOST PART BE OBSERVED
THAT THEY WERE FORCIBLY EXPELLED IN A BODY FROM THE COUNTRY IN WHICH THEY FIRST GREW UP WHILE NOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN CHASED INTO A SOLITARY RECESS IN THE MIDST OF A DESERT MANY IN THIS COUNTRY OPENLY DECLARE THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT ONLY THAT IT IS NOT CONVENIENT
WHICH SOCIETY DOES NOT PRETEND IT HAS A RIGHT TO EXACT BUT I CANNOT CONSENT TO ARGUE THE POINT AS IF SOCIETY HAD NO MEANS OF BRINGING ITS WEAKER MEMBERS UP TO ITS ORDINARY STANDARD OF RATIONAL CONDUCT EXCEPT WAITING TILL THEY DO SOMETHING IRRATIONAL
WHEN THE PERIOD OF EDUCATION IS PAST THE SELF REGARDING VIRTUES SHOULD BE INCULCATED HUMAN BEINGS OWE TO EACH OTHER HELP TO DISTINGUISH THE BETTER FROM THE WORSE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO CHOOSE THE FORMER AND AVOID THE LATTER
I CLAIM AS A CITIZEN A RIGHT TO LEGISLATE WHENEVER MY SOCIAL RIGHTS ARE INVADED BY THE SOCIAL ACT OF ANOTHER
NO MORE THAN BETWEEN THE DESIRE OF A THIEF TO TAKE A PURSE AND THE DESIRE OF THE RIGHT OWNER TO KEEP IT AND A PERSON'S TASTE IS AS MUCH HIS OWN PECULIAR CONCERN AS HIS OPINION OR HIS PURSE

WITHOUT DOUBT ABSTINENCE ON ONE DAY IN THE WEEK SO FAR AS THE EXIGENCIES OF LIFE PERMIT FROM THE USUAL DAILY OCCUPATION THOUGH IN NO RESPECT RELIGIOUSLY BINDING ON ANY EXCEPT JEWS IS A HIGHLY BENEFICIAL CUSTOM
OR WHO CAN BLAME PEOPLE FOR DESIRING TO SUPPRESS WHAT THEY REGARD AS A SCANDAL IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND MAN NO STRONGER CASE CAN BE SHOWN FOR PROHIBITING ANYTHING WHICH IS REGARDED AS A PERSONAL IMMORALITY
BUT WHICH DOES NOT AFFECT THE INTERESTS OF OTHERS IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH HIM ACTS INJURIOUS TO OTHERS REQUIRE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT TREATMENT ENCROACHMENT ON THEIR RIGHTS
NOT SIMPLY THREATENED BUT LONG SINCE CARRIED INTO TRIUMPHANT EFFECT
FLYING FROM THEIR NATIVE COUNTRY BEFORE THE CALIPHS ARRIVED IN WESTERN INDIA THEY WERE ADMITTED TO TOLERATION BY THE HINDOO SOVEREIGNS ON CONDITION OF NOT EATING BEEF
AND OPINIONS PROPOSED WHICH ASSERT AN UNLIMITED RIGHT IN THE PUBLIC NOT ONLY TO PROHIBIT BY LAW EVERYTHING WHICH IT THINKS WRONG BUT IN ORDER TO GET AT WHAT IT THINKS WRONG TO PROHIBIT ANY NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH IT ADMITS TO BE INNOCENT
THOUGH THE PHRASE IS NOT UNOBJECTIONABLE LOWNESS OR DEPRAVATION OF TASTE

MARCH EIGHTEEN O ONE HAVING MY TRULY DEAREST FRIEND GOT THROUGH A GREAT DEAL OF BUSINESS I AM ENABLED TO DO JUSTICE TO MY PRIVATE FEELINGS WHICH ARE FIXED EVER ON YOU AND ABOUT YOU WHENEVER THE PUBLIC SERVICE DOES NOT ARREST MY ATTENTION
WHO BROKE ALL THE SNARES AND ROPES BEING GONE FROM THENCE THEY LAY ALL THE REST OF THAT NIGHT IN A LODGE NEAR UNTO COUDRAY WHERE THEY WERE COMFORTED IN THEIR MISERIES BY THE GRACIOUS WORDS OF ONE OF THEIR COMPANY CALLED SWEER TO GO WHO SHOWED THEM THAT THIS ADVENTURE HAD BEEN FORETOLD BY THE PROPHET DAVID PSALM
AND ALSO ONE FOR THE COURIER BOAT TO TELL YOU HOW DREARY AND UNCOMFORTABLE THE VANGUARD APPEARS IS ONLY TELLING YOU WHAT IT IS TO GO FROM THE PLEASANTEST SOCIETY TO A SOLITARY CELL OR FROM THE DEAREST FRIENDS TO NO FRIENDS I AM NOW PERFECTLY THE GREAT MAN NOT A CREATURE NEAR ME
FOR NEITHER OF WHICH WOULD THIS BE AT ALL A BEFITTING RESOLUTION IN THE FIRST PLACE OF THOSE WHO WITH MORE THAN A DUE CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OWN POWERS ARE PRECIPITATE IN THEIR JUDGMENTS AND WANT THE PATIENCE REQUISITE FOR ORDERLY AND CIRCUMSPECT THINKING
AND WAS BESIDES FORTUNATELY UNDISTURBED BY ANY CARES OR PASSIONS I REMAINED THE WHOLE DAY IN SECLUSION WITH FULL OPPORTUNITY TO OCCUPY MY ATTENTION WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS
TO THE VENGEANCE WHOM HER EYES FIRST ENCOUNTERED WELL I AM SURE BOLDFACE I HOPE
I SHOULD MUCH BETTER SUCCEED IN THE CONDUCT OF MY LIFE THAN IF I BUILT ONLY UPON OLD FOUNDATIONS AND LEANED UPON PRINCIPLES WHICH IN MY YOUTH I HAD TAKEN UPON TRUST
AS IT WERE TO USE MY OWN REASON IN THE CONDUCT OF MY LIFE BUT LIKE ONE WALKING ALONE AND IN THE DARK I RESOLVED TO PROCEED SO SLOWLY AND WITH SUCH CIRCUMSPECTION
TRUTH IN THE SCIENCES THE MATHEMATICIANS ALONE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY DEMONSTRATIONS THAT IS ANY CERTAIN AND EVIDENT REASONS I DID NOT DOUBT BUT THAT SUCH MUST HAVE BEEN THE RULE OF THEIR INVESTIGATIONS
ONE IS DISPOSED TO ALLEGE THAT CHANCE RATHER THAN ANY HUMAN WILL GUIDED BY REASON MUST HAVE LED TO SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT AND IF WE CONSIDER THAT NEVERTHELESS THERE HAVE BEEN AT ALL TIMES CERTAIN OFFICERS
NOR IN THIS PERHAPS SHALL I APPEAR TOO VAIN IF IT BE CONSIDERED THAT AS THE TRUTH ON ANY PARTICULAR POINT IS ONE WHOEVER APPREHENDS THE TRUTH KNOWS ALL THAT ON THAT POINT CAN BE KNOWN
THE SHADOW ATTENDANT ON MADAME DEFARGE AND HER PARTY SEEMED TO FALL SO THREATENING AND DARK ON THE CHILD THAT HER MOTHER INSTINCTIVELY KNEELED ON THE GROUND BESIDE HER AND HELD HER TO HER BREAST
HAVE FOLLOWED THE APPOINTMENTS OF SOME WISE LEGISLATOR IT IS THUS QUITE CERTAIN THAT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE TRUE RELIGION THE ORDINANCES OF WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM GOD MUST BE INCOMPARABLY SUPERIOR TO THAT OF EVERY OTHER
WITHIN AN HOUR WILL YOU ACCOMPANY ME SAID MISTER LORRY JOYFULLY RELIEVED AFTER READING THIS NOTE ALOUD TO WHERE HIS WIFE RESIDES
THE SINGLE DESIGN TO STRIP ONE'S SELF OF ALL PAST BELIEFS IS ONE THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE TAKEN BY EVERY ONE THE MAJORITY OF MEN IS COMPOSED OF TWO CLASSES
MISERY OPPRESSION AND NEGLECT OF ALL KINDS WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING ELSE RETURNED THE VENGEANCE
USING HIS NATURAL AND UNPREJUDICED JUDGMENT DRAWS RESPECTING THE MATTERS OF HIS EXPERIENCE AND BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL TO PASS THROUGH A STATE OF INFANCY TO MANHOOD AND HAVE BEEN OF NECESSITY FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
THAT IN THE TWO OR THREE MONTHS I DEVOTED TO THEIR EXAMINATION NOT ONLY DID I REACH SOLUTIONS OF QUESTIONS I HAD FORMERLY DEEMED EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT BUT EVEN AS REGARDS QUESTIONS OF THE SOLUTION OF WHICH I CONTINUED IGNORANT
MY MIND TO THE LOVE AND NOURISHMENT OF TRUTH AND TO A DISTASTE FOR ALL SUCH REASONINGS AS WERE UNSOUND BUT I HAD NO INTENTION ON THAT ACCOUNT OF ATTEMPTING TO MASTER ALL
MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN IT HAS OF LATE GONE WITH MANY POOR SOULS CHEER UP AND HAVE A THANKFUL HEART I AM NOT THANKLESS I HOPE
NOT VISIBLE AND PRESENTED BUT INDISTINCT AND WITHHELD TO ALARM LUCIE INTO SAYING AS SHE LAID HER APPEALING HAND ON MADAME DEFARGE'S DRESS
YES I COME FROM DOCTOR MANETTE AND WHAT SAYS HE WHAT DOES HE SEND ME
AND TO SPEAK OF HUMAN AFFAIRS I BELIEVE THAT THE PRE EMINENCE OF SPARTA WAS DUE NOT TO THE GOODNESS OF EACH OF ITS LAWS IN PARTICULAR FOR MANY OF THESE WERE VERY STRANGE AND EVEN OPPOSED TO GOOD MORALS BUT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT
I HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE OBJECTS WITH WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO COMMENCE FOR I WAS ALREADY PERSUADED THAT IT MUST BE WITH THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW AND CONSIDERING THAT OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE HITHERTO SOUGHT
SERVE FOR PURPOSES FOR WHICH THEY WERE NOT ORIGINALLY BUILT THUS ALSO THOSE ANCIENT CITIES WHICH FROM BEING AT FIRST ONLY VILLAGES HAVE BECOME IN COURSE OF TIME LARGE TOWNS
PERCEIVING FURTHER THAT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THESE RELATIONS I SHOULD SOMETIMES HAVE TO CONSIDER THEM ONE BY ONE AND SOMETIMES ONLY TO BEAR THEM IN MIND OR EMBRACE THEM IN THE AGGREGATE
TO THE CONSIDERATION OF FIGURES THAT IT CAN EXERCISE THE UNDERSTANDING ONLY ON CONDITION OF GREATLY FATIGUING THE IMAGINATION AND IN THE LATTER THERE IS SO COMPLETE A SUBJECTION TO CERTAIN RULES AND FORMULAS
WHO HAD LEFT HER IN EXACTLY THE SAME ATTITUDE SOME SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO IT IS SHE OBSERVED HER HUSBAND DOES MADAME GO WITH US INQUIRED MISTER LORRY SEEING THAT SHE MOVED AS THEY MOVED
THE CHILD FOR EXAMPLE WHO HAS BEEN INSTRUCTED IN THE ELEMENTS OF ARITHMETIC AND HAS MADE A PARTICULAR ADDITION ACCORDING TO RULE
I MIGHT ASCEND BY LITTLE AND LITTLE AND AS IT WERE STEP BY STEP TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MORE COMPLEX ASSIGNING IN THOUGHT A CERTAIN ORDER EVEN TO THOSE OBJECTS WHICH IN THEIR OWN NATURE DO NOT STAND IN A RELATION OF ANTECEDENCE AND SEQUENCE
HAS MUCH INFLUENCE AROUND HIM SURELY IT WILL RELEASE HIM SAID MADAME DEFARGE LET IT DO SO
AND THEREBY RENDERING THE STREETS MORE HANDSOME BUT IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL TAKES DOWN HIS OWN WITH THE VIEW OF ERECTING IT ANEW AND THAT PEOPLE ARE EVEN SOMETIMES CONSTRAINED TO THIS WHEN THEIR HOUSES ARE IN DANGER OF FALLING FROM AGE
TILL NIGHT WITHOUT EVER SEEING A BOOK OR A DESK OR A SCHOOL BUT MY CHILDREN THERE CAME A MORNING WHEN PINOCCHIO AWOKE
HE LOOKED FOR LAMP WICK EVERYWHERE ALONG THE STREETS IN THE SQUARES INSIDE THE THEATRES EVERYWHERE BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND HE ASKED EVERYONE
I WANTED TO RETURN HOME I WANTED TO BE OBEDIENT I WANTED TO STUDY AND TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL BUT LAMP WICK SAID TO ME
BECOME LIKE THOSE OF A DONKEY IN A LITTLE WHILE HE CHANGES INTO A REAL DONKEY AND BEGINS TO BRAY EVERYONE AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD THE NEWS DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT GOOD LUCK IS MINE WHAT IS IT TOMORROW I END MY DAYS AS A MARIONETTE AND BECOME A BOY LIKE YOU AND ALL MY OTHER FRIENDS
BUT THE FAULT IS NOT MINE BELIEVE ME LITTLE DORMOUSE
YOURS FIRST THEN MINE WELL THEN
I LEAVE YOU TO THINK OF THE TERRIBLE GRIEF THE SHAME THE DESPAIR OF THE POOR MARIONETTE HE BEGAN TO CRY TO SCREAM TO KNOCK HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL
VERY VERY SURE
EVEN TO THE COLLEGES IF YOU MEET THEM ON THE WAY
THE DORMOUSE TOOK PINOCCHIO'S WRIST BETWEEN HER PAWS AND AFTER A FEW MINUTES LOOKED UP AT HIM SORROWFULLY AND SAID MY FRIEND
NOR SLEEP NOR DISCOMFORT NO SOONER HAD THE WAGON STOPPED THAN THE LITTLE FAT MAN TURNED TO LAMP WICK WITH BOWS AND SMILES HE ASKED IN A WHEEDLING TONE
A DORMOUSE CAME INTO THE ROOM A FAT LITTLE DORMOUSE WHO LIVED UPSTAIRS SEEING PINOCCHIO SO GRIEF STRICKEN SHE ASKED HIM ANXIOUSLY WHAT IS THE MATTER DEAR LITTLE NEIGHBOR
IS COMPOSED OF SIX SATURDAYS AND ONE SUNDAY VERY SURE AND THAT
IN THE DISTANCE A SMALL LIGHT FLICKERED A QUEER SOUND COULD BE HEARD SOFT AS A LITTLE BELL AND FAINT AND MUFFLED LIKE THE
BOYS GIVE PROMISES VERY EASILY BUT THEY AS EASILY FORGET THEM BUT I AM NOT LIKE THOSE OTHERS WHEN I GIVE MY WORD I KEEP IT
AND CLAPPED THEIR HANDS IN HEARTY APPLAUSE SUDDENLY THE LITTLE DONKEY GAVE A KICK WITH HIS TWO HIND FEET AND AT THIS UNEXPECTED MOVE
HE LEARNED TO MUMBLE A FEW WORDS WHEN HE LIVED FOR THREE YEARS WITH A
I AM SORRY BUT I MUST GIVE YOU SOME VERY SAD NEWS WHAT IS IT YOU HAVE A VERY BAD FEVER
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WILL YOU COME WITH US
AND WHO HAS BEEN SO KIND TO ME AND BY THIS TIME I
AND REASONABLE PINOCCHIO MOUNTED AND THE WAGON STARTED ON ITS WAY WHILE THE DONKEYS GALLOPED ALONG THE STONY ROAD
ASKED PINOCCHIO RUNNING UP TO HIM I AM WAITING FOR MIDNIGHT TO STRIKE TO GO WHERE FAR FAR AWAY AND I HAVE GONE TO YOUR HOUSE THREE TIMES TO LOOK FOR YOU
LIKE A BOX OF SARDINES THEY WERE UNCOMFORTABLE THEY WERE PILED ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER THEY COULD HARDLY BREATHE YET NOT ONE WORD OF COMPLAINT WAS HEARD THE THOUGHT
CATCALLS HAND CLAPPING FOLLOWED THIS PARADE ONE BOY MADE A NOISE LIKE A HEN ANOTHER LIKE A ROOSTER AND A THIRD IMITATED A LION IN HIS DEN ALL TOGETHER THEY CREATED SUCH A PANDEMONIUM THAT IT
GOOD BY THEN AND REMEMBER ME TO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS TO THE HIGH SCHOOLS
WERE WORDS LIKE THESE HURRAH FOR THE LAND OF TOYS DOWN WITH ARITHMETIC NO MORE SCHOOL AS SOON AS THEY HAD SET FOOT IN THAT LAND PINOCCHIO
THE FAIRY'S WORDS HAD THROWN HIM PINOCCHIO ASKED FOR PERMISSION TO GIVE OUT THE INVITATIONS
THE LONGER AND THE MORE HAIRY GREW HIS EARS
AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF PLAY PINOCCHIO WAKES UP ONE FINE MORNING AND FINDS A GREAT SURPRISE AWAITING HIM FINALLY THE WAGON ARRIVED IT MADE NO NOISE
AT THE WORD THREE THE TWO BOYS PULLED OFF THEIR CAPS
AT THE SIGHT OF THAT BAG PINOCCHIO FELT SLIGHTLY HAPPIER AND THOUGHT TO HIMSELF MY FRIEND MUST BE SUFFERING FROM THE SAME SICKNESS THAT I AM
THAT IN THAT COUNTRY EACH
THEIR ARMS TURNED INTO LEGS THEIR FACES LENGTHENED INTO SNOUTS AND THEIR BACKS BECAME COVERED WITH LONG GRAY HAIRS THIS WAS HUMILIATION ENOUGH
AND TURNED BACK HE TOOK A LARGE COTTON BAG FROM A SHELF PUT IT ON HIS HEAD AND PULLED IT FAR DOWN TO HIS VERY NOSE THUS ADORNED HE WENT OUT
HE TOOK TO IT LIKE A DUCK THERE WAS AN EDITOR CONCEALED IN HIM SURE ALREADY HE HAD DOUBLED HIMSELF IN ONE WAY HE TALKED SIXTH CENTURY AND WROTE NINETEENTH HIS JOURNALISTIC STYLE WAS CLIMBING STEADILY
PLEASE NOW I THINK I BEGIN TO SEE WHAT IT IS YES I'VE STRUCK IT YOU SEE THE GENUINE SPIRITLESSNESS IS WANTING THAT'S WHAT'S THE TROUBLE IT'S ALL AMATEUR
PERMITTING NOTHING OF IT IN MY OTHER EDUCATIONAL BUILDINGS I COULD HAVE GIVEN MY OWN SECT THE PREFERENCE AND MADE EVERYBODY A PRESBYTERIAN WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO AFFRONT A LAW OF HUMAN NATURE
AND SNUFF OUT ALL MY BEAUTIFUL CIVILIZATION JUST LIKE THAT I FOUND NO LIFE STIRRING IN THE SOMBER STREETS I GROPED MY WAY WITH A HEAVY HEART
AND MOREOVER I COULDN'T SEEM TO STAND THAT SHIELD SLATTING AND BANGING NOW ABOUT MY BREAST
IS ITS OWN HIGHEST REWARD THE POOREST PAID ARCHITECT ENGINEER GENERAL AUTHOR SCULPTOR PAINTER LECTURER ADVOCATE LEGISLATOR ACTOR PREACHER SINGER IS
FROM BEING THE BEST ELECTRIC LIGHTED TOWN IN THE KINGDOM AND THE MOST LIKE A RECUMBENT SUN OF ANYTHING YOU EVER SAW IT WAS BECOME SIMPLY A BLOT A BLOT UPON DARKNESS
AND PEOPLE SAY WHAT THEY WOULD OF COURSE THESE IRON DUDES OF THE ROUND TABLE WOULD THINK IT WAS SCANDALOUS AND MAYBE RAISE SHEOL ABOUT IT BUT AS FOR ME GIVE ME COMFORT FIRST AND STYLE AFTERWARDS
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT AT LAST IN THE FURTHER EDGE OF THAT TOWN I SAW A SMALL FUNERAL PROCESSION JUST A FAMILY AND A FEW FRIENDS FOLLOWING A COFFIN
AND YOU HAD TO BE ALWAYS CHANGING HANDS AND PASSING YOUR SPEAR OVER TO THE OTHER FOOT IT GOT SO IRKSOME FOR ONE HAND TO HOLD IT LONG AT A TIME WELL
HOW DEAR AND GOOD IT IS OF YOU TOO BUT I WANT TO HEAR THESE LIPS OF YOURS WHICH ARE ALSO MINE UTTER IT FIRST THEN ITS MUSIC WILL BE PERFECT PLEASED TO THE MARROW SHE MURMURED HELLO CENTRAL I DIDN'T LAUGH
PLEASE YOU BETRAY TOO MUCH VIGOR TOO MUCH DECISION YOU WANT MORE OF A SHAMBLE LOOK AT ME PLEASE THIS IS WHAT I MEAN NOW YOU ARE GETTING IT
IF I DROPPED INTO A WALK MY JOINTS CREAKED AND SCREECHED IN THAT WEARISOME WAY THAT A WHEELBARROW DOES AND AS WE DIDN'T CREATE ANY BREEZE AT THAT GAIT I WAS LIKE TO GET FRIED IN THAT STOVE AND BESIDES THE QUIETER YOU WENT
IN FACT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THAT CAN RIGHT THE MATTER BUT PRACTICE THIS IS A GOOD PLACE FOR IT ROOTS AND STONY GROUND TO BREAK UP YOUR STATELY GAIT A REGION NOT LIABLE TO INTERRUPTION
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CRUEL TO CONFESS IT AND SPOIL HER PRETTY GAME SO I NEVER LET ON BUT SAID YES I KNOW SWEETHEART
I DON'T DENY THAT I AM NOT BETTER THAN OTHERS WE COULDN'T SEEM TO MEET ANYBODY IN THIS LONESOME BRITAIN NOT EVEN AN OGRE AND IN THE MOOD I WAS IN THEN IT WAS WELL FOR THE OGRE THAT IS AN OGRE WITH A HANDKERCHIEF
JUST A DEAD AND EMPTY SOLITUDE IN PLACE OF ALL THAT BRISK AND BREEZY LIFE I WENT SWIFTLY BACK SAYING NOT A WORD TO ANYBODY I TOLD SANDY THIS GHASTLY NEWS
OPPRESSION INSULT AND THE OTHER SEVERAL AND COMMON INHUMANITIES THAT SAP THE MANLINESS OUT OF A MAN AND MAKE HIM A LOYAL AND PROPER AND APPROVED SUBJECT AND A SATISFACTION TO HIS MASTERS
AND PARALYSIS TO HUMAN THOUGHT ALL MINES WERE ROYAL PROPERTY AND THERE WERE A GOOD MANY OF THEM THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN WORKED AS SAVAGES ALWAYS WORK MINES
YOU COULDN'T THINK WHERE SANDY WAS SHE WAS A QUITE BIDDABLE CREATURE AND GOOD HEARTED BUT SHE HAD A FLOW OF TALK THAT WAS AS STEADY AS A MILL AND MADE YOUR HEAD SORE LIKE THE DRAYS AND WAGONS IN A CITY
NOW TIS RIGHT NOT QUITE
RICH GLOOM OF THE FOREST WHERE
DRILL HAD GONE ON A LITTLE WHILE I SAID NOW SIRE IMAGINE THAT WE ARE AT THE DOOR OF THE HUT YONDER AND THE FAMILY ARE BEFORE US PROCEED PLEASE ACCOST THE HEAD OF THE HOUSE THE KING
A FLY GOT IN THROUGH THE BARS AND SETTLED ON MY NOSE AND THE BARS WERE STUCK AND WOULDN'T WORK AND I COULDN'T GET THE VISOR UP AND I COULD ONLY SHAKE MY HEAD WHICH WAS
CLEAREST AND COLDEST OF RUNLETS WENT FRISKING AND GOSSIPING OVER ITS REEFS AND MAKING A SORT OF WHISPERING MUSIC COMFORTABLE TO HEAR AND AT TIMES WE LEFT THE WORLD BEHIND AND ENTERED INTO THE SOLEMN GREAT DEEPS AND
AND THERE HUNG THE BELL SHROUDED IN BLACK
THE ONE IS EARTHLY THE OTHER DIVINE IN MY DREAMS ALONG AT FIRST I STILL WANDERED THIRTEEN CENTURIES AWAY
AS SURE A FACT AND AS SUBSTANTIAL A FACT AS ANY SERENE VOLCANO STANDING INNOCENT WITH ITS SMOKELESS SUMMIT IN THE BLUE SKY AND GIVING NO SIGN OF THE RISING HELL IN ITS BOWELS
IT WAS ALREADY UP TO THE BACK SETTLEMENT ALABAMA MARK AND COULDN'T BE TOLD FROM THE EDITORIAL OUTPUT OF THAT REGION EITHER BY MATTER OR FLAVOR WE HAD ANOTHER LARGE DEPARTURE ON HAND TOO
OUR TRAVELLERS SPENT THE FIRST DAY VERY AGREEABLY THEY WERE DELIGHTED WITH POSSESSING MORE TREASURE THAN ALL ASIA EUROPE AND AFRICA COULD SCRAPE TOGETHER
WHO OFFERED TO AGREE WITH THEM UPON REASONABLE TERMS HE APPOINTED TO MEET THEM AT A PUBLIC HOUSE
I AM AFRAID THAT THIS MAN HOLDS OUR GERMAN POETS IN VERY GREAT CONTEMPT THERE WOULD NOT BE MUCH HARM IN THAT SAID MARTIN OH WHAT A SUPERIOR MAN SAID CANDIDE BELOW HIS BREATH WHAT A GREAT GENIUS IS THIS POCOCURANTE NOTHING CAN PLEASE HIM
HE WEPT FOR A LONG WHILE AT LAST HE DREW CACAMBO ASIDE HERE MY DEAR FRIEND SAID HE TO HIM THIS THOU MUST DO WE HAVE EACH OF US IN HIS POCKET FIVE OR SIX MILLIONS IN DIAMONDS
IMPOSSIBLE TO TREAT ONE'S RELATIONS IN A MORE BARBAROUS MANNER
WHAT ART THOU DOING THERE FRIEND IN THAT SHOCKING CONDITION I AM WAITING FOR MY MASTER MYNHEER VANDERDENDUR THE FAMOUS MERCHANT ANSWERED THE NEGRO
THE SECOND DAY TWO OF THEIR SHEEP PLUNGED INTO A MORASS WHERE THEY AND THEIR BURDENS WERE LOST TWO MORE DIED OF FATIGUE A FEW DAYS AFTER SEVEN OR EIGHT PERISHED WITH HUNGER IN A DESERT
THERE SAID HE IS A BOOK THAT WAS ONCE THE DELIGHT OF THE GREAT PANGLOSS THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN GERMANY IT IS NOT MINE ANSWERED POCOCURANTE COOLLY THEY USED AT ONE TIME TO MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT I TOOK A PLEASURE IN READING HIM
PROMISING TO CHOOSE HIM WHO APPEARED TO BE MOST JUSTLY DISCONTENTED WITH HIS STATE AND TO BESTOW SOME PRESENTS UPON THE REST THEY SAT UNTIL FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
MY FRIEND YOU SEE HOW PERISHABLE ARE THE RICHES OF THIS WORLD THERE IS NOTHING SOLID BUT VIRTUE
THIS PHILOSOPHER WAS AN HONEST MAN BUT HE HAD BEEN ROBBED BY HIS WIFE BEATEN BY HIS SON AND ABANDONED BY HIS DAUGHTER WHO GOT A PORTUGUESE TO RUN AWAY WITH HER HE HAD JUST BEEN DEPRIVED OF A SMALL EMPLOYMENT ON WHICH HE SUBSISTED
THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE WITH PAQUETTE AND THE THEATIN THE REPAST WAS ENTERTAINING AND TOWARDS THE END THEY CONVERSED WITH ALL CONFIDENCE
AND WHO WHILE MOSES REPRESENTS THE ETERNAL PRODUCING THE WORLD BY A WORD MAKES THE MESSIAH TAKE A GREAT PAIR OF COMPASSES FROM THE ARMOURY OF HEAVEN TO CIRCUMSCRIBE HIS WORK HOW CAN I HAVE ANY ESTEEM FOR A WRITER WHO HAS SPOILED TASSO'S HELL AND THE DEVIL
I'LL ANSWER FOR IT SAID HE THAT WITH THIS THEY WILL BE HAPPY
LET WHO WILL GO TO SEE BAD TRAGEDIES SET TO MUSIC WHERE THE SCENES ARE CONTRIVED FOR NO OTHER END THAN TO INTRODUCE TWO OR THREE SONGS RIDICULOUSLY OUT OF PLACE TO SHOW OFF AN ACTRESS'S VOICE LET WHO WILL OR WHO CAN
BUT WHEN I RETURN AT NIGHT TO THE MONASTERY I AM READY TO DASH MY HEAD AGAINST THE WALLS OF THE DORMITORY AND ALL MY FELLOWS ARE IN THE SAME CASE
BUT WITH DISCRETION MARTIN WAS ENTIRELY OF THE SENATOR'S OPINION THEY SAT DOWN TO TABLE AND AFTER AN EXCELLENT DINNER THEY WENT INTO THE LIBRARY
I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT GOD HAS ABANDONED IT TO SOME MALIGNANT BEING I EXCEPT ALWAYS EL DORADO I SCARCELY EVER KNEW A CITY THAT DID NOT DESIRE THE DESTRUCTION OF A NEIGHBOURING CITY
IN ALL OUR ITALY WE WRITE ONLY WHAT WE DO NOT THINK THOSE WHO INHABIT THE COUNTRY OF THE CAESARS AND THE ANTONINUSES
AY SAID THE SKIPPER TO HIMSELF THIS MAN AGREES TO PAY TWENTY THOUSAND PIASTRES WITH AS MUCH EASE AS TEN HE WENT BACK TO HIM AGAIN AND DECLARED THAT HE COULD NOT CARRY HIM TO VENICE FOR LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PIASTRES
I HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE FRIGHTFUL DISASTERS THAT BEFELL THE FAMILY OF MY LADY BARONESS
WHEREAS MARTIN HAD NOTHING AT ALL TO HOPE BESIDES CANDIDE WAS POSSESSED OF MONEY AND JEWELS
HIS WIFE WHO WAS MAD WITH JEALOUSY BEAT ME EVERY DAY UNMERCIFULLY SHE WAS A FURY THE SURGEON WAS ONE OF THE UGLIEST OF MEN
I HAVE SEEN SO MUCH AND EXPERIENCED SO MUCH THAT I AM A MANICHEAN
ARE ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF ANY ONE WITH THE LEAST TASTE AND HIS LONG DESCRIPTION OF A PEST HOUSE IS GOOD ONLY FOR A GRAVE DIGGER THIS OBSCURE WHIMSICAL AND DISAGREEABLE POEM WAS DESPISED UPON ITS FIRST PUBLICATION
OF THEIR JEALOUSIES OF THEIR QUARRELS OF THEIR HUMOURS OF THEIR PETTINESSES OF THEIR PRIDES OF THEIR FOLLIES AND OF THE SONNETS WHICH ONE MUST MAKE OR HAVE MADE FOR THEM BUT AFTER ALL THESE TWO GIRLS BEGIN TO WEARY ME
INSTEAD OF HER I HAVE ONLY MET A PARISIAN WENCH AND A PERIGORDIAN ABBE CUNEGONDE IS DEAD WITHOUT DOUBT AND THERE IS NOTHING FOR ME BUT TO DIE ALAS HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR ME TO HAVE REMAINED IN THE PARADISE OF EL DORADO
THEN HE LISTENED PATIENTLY PROMISED TO EXAMINE INTO HIS AFFAIR AT THE SKIPPER'S RETURN AND ORDERED HIM TO PAY TEN THOUSAND PIASTRES FOR THE EXPENSE OF THE HEARING
ASKED WHETHER HE DID NOT LOOK UPON THIS AUTHOR AS A GREAT MAN WHO SAID POCOCURANTE THAT BARBARIAN WHO WRITES A LONG COMMENTARY IN TEN BOOKS OF HARSH VERSE ON THE FIRST CHAPTER OF GENESIS
YES SIR SAID THE NEGRO IT IS THE CUSTOM THEY GIVE US A PAIR OF LINEN DRAWERS FOR OUR WHOLE GARMENT TWICE A YEAR WHEN WE WORK AT THE SUGAR CANES AND THE MILL SNATCHES HOLD OF A FINGER
AFTER HE HAD HIRED DOMESTICS AND PURCHASED EVERYTHING NECESSARY FOR A LONG VOYAGE
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AT SURINAM
HITHERTO I HAVE MET WITH NONE BUT UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE HABITABLE GLOBE EXCEPT IN EL DORADO BUT AS TO THIS PAIR I WOULD VENTURE TO LAY A WAGER THAT THEY ARE VERY HAPPY I LAY YOU THEY ARE NOT SAID MARTIN
THE POOR MAN HAD LOST HIS LEFT LEG AND HIS RIGHT HAND
DIE AWAY WITH PLEASURE AT THE SIGHT OF AN EUNUCH QUAVERING THE ROLE OF CAESAR OR OF CATO AND STRUTTING AWKWARDLY UPON THE STAGE FOR MY PART I HAVE LONG SINCE RENOUNCED THOSE PALTRY ENTERTAINMENTS
OR ELSE SHE HAD COME INTO THE CHURCH SHE SAT IN THE PEW WITH THE CLERGYMAN'S FAMILY AND WHEN THEY HAD ENDED THE PSALM AND LOOKED UP THEY NODDED AND SAID IT IS RIGHT THAT THOU ART COME IT WAS THROUGH MERCY SHE SAID
THE SUN SHONE GLORIOUSLY KAREN AND THE OLD LADY WALKED ALONG THE PATH THROUGH THE CORN IT WAS RATHER DUSTY THERE AT THE CHURCH DOOR STOOD AN OLD SOLDIER WITH A CRUTCH AND WITH A WONDERFULLY LONG BEARD
THE FAMILY WENT TO HEAR THE WORD OF GOD BUT SHE WENT ALONE INTO HER LITTLE CHAMBER THERE WAS ONLY ROOM FOR A BED AND CHAIR TO STAND IN IT AND HERE SHE SAT DOWN WITH HER PRAYER BOOK
SO THAT PEOPLE THINK IT IS REALLY A FLAME BUT THEY SOON DISCOVER IT IS SOMETHING ELSE HE ROVES ABOUT IN THE GARDEN OF THE PALACE AND UPON THE RAMPARTS YES ONCE HE EVEN SHOT YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER RIGHT IN THE HEART
I WILL TELL ALL CHILDREN ABOUT HIM THAT THEY MAY TAKE CARE AND NOT PLAY WITH HIM FOR HE WILL ONLY CAUSE THEM SORROW AND MANY A HEARTACHE
WARMED HIS HANDS BETWEEN HIS OWN AND BOILED FOR HIM SOME SWEET WINE THEN THE BOY RECOVERED HIS CHEEKS AGAIN GREW ROSY HE JUMPED DOWN FROM THE LAP WHERE HE WAS SITTING
SHE DANCED OVER THE CHURCHYARD BUT THE DEAD DID NOT DANCE THEY HAD SOMETHING BETTER TO DO THAN TO DANCE
I WILL TRY IT DIRECTLY AND HE BENT HIS BOW TOOK AIM AND SHOT AN ARROW AT THE OLD POET RIGHT INTO HIS HEART YOU SEE NOW THAT MY BOW WAS NOT SPOILED SAID HE LAUGHING
AND SHE WAS FORCED TO DANCE THROUGH THE GLOOMY NIGHT THE SHOES CARRIED HER OVER STACK AND STONE SHE WAS TORN TILL SHE BLED SHE DANCED OVER THE HEATH TILL SHE CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE
POOR THING SAID THE OLD POET AS HE WENT TO OPEN THE DOOR THERE STOOD A LITTLE BOY QUITE NAKED AND THE WATER RAN DOWN FROM HIS LONG GOLDEN HAIR HE TREMBLED WITH COLD
ON THE VERY DAY HER MOTHER WAS BURIED KAREN RECEIVED THE RED SHOES AND WORE THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY WERE CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED FOR MOURNING BUT SHE HAD NO OTHERS
THOU DOST NOT KNOW WHO I AM I FANCY I STRIKE BAD PEOPLE'S HEADS OFF AND I HEAR THAT MY AXE RINGS DON'T STRIKE MY HEAD OFF SAID KAREN THEN I CAN'T REPENT OF MY SINS
IN THE AFTERNOON THE OLD LADY HEARD FROM EVERYONE THAT THE SHOES HAD BEEN RED AND SHE SAID THAT IT WAS VERY WRONG OF KAREN THAT IT WAS NOT AT ALL BECOMING AND THAT IN FUTURE KAREN SHOULD ONLY GO IN BLACK SHOES TO CHURCH
AND SOON ANOTHER PHANTOM TIDE OF SHIFTING DREAMS BEGINS TO PLAY AND DUSKY GALLEYS PAST ME SAIL FULL FREIGHTED ON A FAERIE SEA I HEAR THE SILKEN MERCHANTS HAIL ACROSS THE RINGING WAVES TO ME
AND WENT INTO THE CHURCH WITH KAREN AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE CHURCH LOOKED AT KAREN'S RED SHOES AND ALL THE PICTURES AND AS KAREN KNELT BEFORE THE ALTAR AND RAISED THE CUP TO HER LIPS
O HAPPY PEOPLE I HAVE SEEN NO VERSE YET WRITTEN IN YOUR PRAISE AND TRUTH TO TELL THE TIME HAS BEEN I WOULD HAVE SCORNED YOUR EASY WAYS BUT NOW THRO WEARINESS AND STRIFE
AND HOMELESS LONGING VEXES ME FOR LORE THAT I SHALL NEVER KNOW AND VISIONS NONE CAN HOPE TO SEE TILL BROODING WORKS UPON ME SO A CHILDISH FEAR STEALS OVER ME I LOOK AROUND THE EMPTY ROOM
AND DOWN THE MOSS GROWN PATHS AND TERRACE NO MAN TREADS WHERE THE OLD OLD WEEDS RISE DEEP ON THE WASTE GARDEN BEDS
BE BOLD AND DARE THE GLORIOUS LEAP OR TO THY SHAME GO SLINK AGAIN BACK TO THE NARROW WAYS OF MEN SO ALL THESE MOCKED ME AS I STOOD STRIVING TO WAKE BECAUSE I FEARED THE FLOOD
AND STRAIGHT BEFORE HER STOOD THE ANGEL OF GOD IN WHITE GARMENTS THE SAME SHE HAD SEEN THAT NIGHT AT THE CHURCH DOOR BUT HE NO LONGER CARRIED THE SHARP SWORD BUT IN ITS STEAD A SPLENDID GREEN SPRAY FULL OF ROSES
AND HE TOUCHED THE CEILING WITH THE SPRAY AND THE CEILING ROSE SO HIGH AND WHERE HE HAD TOUCHED IT THERE GLEAMED A GOLDEN STAR AND HE TOUCHED THE WALLS AND THEY WIDENED OUT AND SHE SAW THE ORGAN WHICH WAS PLAYING
WHEN SHE WANTED TO DANCE TO THE RIGHT THE SHOES WOULD DANCE TO THE LEFT AND WHEN SHE WANTED TO DANCE UP THE ROOM THE SHOES DANCED BACK AGAIN DOWN THE STEPS INTO THE STREET AND OUT OF THE CITY GATE SHE DANCED
SHE DID NOT CARE ABOUT THE WAGES ONLY SHE WISHED TO HAVE A HOME AND BE WITH GOOD PEOPLE
ALONG TIME AGO THERE LIVED AN OLD POET A THOROUGHLY KIND OLD POET AS HE WAS SITTING ONE EVENING IN HIS ROOM A DREADFUL STORM AROSE WITHOUT AND THE RAIN STREAMED DOWN FROM HEAVEN
THAT WERE SAD INDEED SAID THE BOY AND HE TOOK THE BOW IN HIS HAND AND EXAMINED IT ON EVERY SIDE OH IT IS DRY AGAIN AND IS NOT HURT AT ALL THE STRING IS QUITE TIGHT
AND HAD HE NOT COME INTO A WARM ROOM HE WOULD MOST CERTAINLY HAVE PERISHED IN THE FRIGHTFUL TEMPEST POOR CHILD SAID THE OLD POET AS HE TOOK THE BOY BY THE HAND COME IN COME IN AND I WILL SOON RESTORE THEE
AND AWAY HE RAN THE NAUGHTY BOY TO SHOOT THE OLD POET IN THAT WAY HE WHO HAD TAKEN HIM INTO HIS WARM ROOM WHO HAD TREATED HIM SO KINDLY
AND THEY FEARED THAT WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT NO BUCCANEER WAS TO RECEIVE QUARTER THE SPANISH COLONISTS WOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME WAY NO MATTER WHERE THEY MIGHT BE FOUND AND TAKEN
AND WHEN THE POOR FELLOW HAD FINISHED BY TELLING THAT HE HAD COME THERE NOT OF HIS OWN ACCORD BUT SIMPLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBEYING HIS MASTER TO HANG ALL THE PIRATES EXCEPT THEIR LEADER THAT GREAT BUCCANEER LAUGHED AND FINDING HE COULD GET NOTHING MORE FROM THE NEGRO
IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BELIEVE IT THE GOOD NEWS OF THE DEATH OF L'OLONNOIS HAD COME FROM CAMPEACHY TO HAVANA AND THE PEOPLE OF THE LATTER TOWN ALSO REJOICED GREATLY TO BE NOW TOLD THAT THIS SCOURGE OF THE WEST INDIES WAS ALIVE
SAID A MAN HERE WE ARE EVERYBODY FIGHTIN BLOOD AN DESTRUCTION
AND IT COULD ALWAYS BE SEEN THAT THEY WERE BEWILDERED BY THE ALLEGED NEWS AND COULD NOT FULLY COMPREHEND A DEFEAT BEFORE THE GRAY MISTS HAD BEEN TOTALLY OBLITERATED BY THE SUN RAYS THE REGIMENT WAS MARCHING IN A SPREAD COLUMN THAT WAS RETIRING CAREFULLY THROUGH THE WOODS
LIKE BIRDS BUT THEY WERE NOW FOR THE MOST PART BLACK CREATURES WHO FLAPPED THEIR WINGS DREARILY NEAR TO THE GROUND AND REFUSED TO RISE ON ANY WINGS OF HOPE THE MEN'S FACES GREW DOLEFUL FROM THE INTERPRETING OF OMENS
OH THE DEVIL IT WILL YOU ALWAYS TALK LIKE A DOG HANGED PARSON DON'T TELL ME I KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN JAWIN LIKE A LOT A OLD HENS
THE YOUTH NEVERTHELESS FELT A THREAT HIS MIND SHRANK FROM GOING NEAR TO THE DANGER AND THEREAFTER HE WAS SILENT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SARCASTIC MAN'S WORDS TOOK FROM HIM ALL LOUD MOODS THAT WOULD MAKE HIM APPEAR PROMINENT
I DON'T THINK I FOUGHT THE WHOLE BATTLE YESTERDAY BUT THE OTHER SEEMED INNOCENT OF ANY DEEPER MEANING APPARENTLY HE HAD NO INFORMATION IT WAS MERELY HIS HABIT OH HE REPLIED IN THE SAME TONE OF CALM DERISION
THEY WERE WORN EXHAUSTED HAVING SLEPT BUT LITTLE AND LABORED MUCH
HE MANAGED TO GET POSSESSION OF A SHIP WHICH HE MANNED WITH A CREW OF ABOUT A SCORE OF IMPECUNIOUS DARE DEVILS WHO WERE VERY ANXIOUS TO DO SOMETHING TO MEND THEIR FORTUNES HAVING NOW BECOME VERY FOND OF LAND FIGHTING
IT'S OUR LUCK T GIT LICKED OFTEN SAID HIS FRIEND IN A WEARY TONE HE WAS TRUDGING ALONG WITH STOOPED SHOULDERS AND SHIFTING EYES LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CANED AND KICKED WELL DON'T WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL
THE MAN OF WAR WAS ANCHORED NOT VERY FAR FROM THE TOWN AND WHEN ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE WATCH ON DECK SAW SOME CANOES APPROACHING THEY SUPPOSED THEM TO BE BOATS FROM SHORE
HE REMARKED SADLY THE YOUTH HAD A THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE HANDSOME FOR HIM TO FREELY CONDEMN OTHER MEN HE MADE AN ATTEMPT TO RESTRAIN HIMSELF BUT THE WORDS UPON HIS TONGUE WERE TOO BITTER
INCREASED TO A LOUD AND JOYOUS BURST AND THEN AS THE SUN WENT SERENELY UP THE SKY THROWING ILLUMINATING RAYS INTO THE GLOOMY THICKETS IT BROKE FORTH INTO PROLONGED PEALINGS THE WOODS BEGAN TO CRACKLE AS IF AFIRE
BUT NOW THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO ALTER HIS PLANS THE ORDINARY PERSON IN COMMAND OF TWO SMALL BOATS WHO SHOULD SUDDENLY DISCOVER THAT A VILLAGE WHICH HE SUPPOSED ALMOST DEFENCELESS WAS PROTECTED BY A LARGE MAN OF WAR
ALL QUIET ON THE RAPPAHANNOCK BUT THE GUNS REFUSED TO PERMIT EVEN A COMMENT UPON THEIR UPROAR HE NEVER SUCCESSFULLY CONCLUDED THE SENTENCE BUT AT LAST THE GUNS STOPPED AND AMONG THE MEN IN THE RIFLE PITS RUMORS AGAIN FLEW
AND THEY FOUGHT EACH SCOUNDREL OF THEM LIKE THREE MEN AND THE SAVAGE FIGHT ENDED BY EVERY SPANISH SAILOR OR OFFICER WHO WAS NOT KILLED OR WOUNDED BEING FORCED TO STAY BELOW DECKS WHERE THE HATCHES WERE SECURELY FASTENED DOWN UPON THEM
AT THIS TIME THERE WAS AN INTERPOSITION BY THE SAVAGE MINDED LIEUTENANT WHO WAS OBLIGED TO VENT SOME OF HIS INWARD DISSATISFACTION UPON HIS MEN YOU BOYS SHUT RIGHT UP
NOW I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE ETERNAL THUNDERS WE WAS MARCHED INTO THESE WOODS FOR ANYHOW UNLESS IT WAS TO GIVE THE REBS A REGULAR POT SHOT AT US WE CAME IN HERE AND GOT OUR LEGS ALL TANGLED UP IN THESE CUSSED BRIERS
NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE WE GO OR WHY WE GO WE JUST GET FIRED AROUND FROM PILLAR TO POST AND GET LICKED HERE AND GET LICKED THERE AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S DONE FOR IT MAKES A MAN FEEL LIKE A DAMN KITTEN IN A BAG
BUT THEIR WAY WAS A VERY DIFFERENT ONE FROM ANY WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED BY THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP THEY ROWED OFF INTO THE DARKNESS INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE TOWN AND WAITED UNTIL NEARLY DAYBREAK THEN THEY BOLDLY MADE FOR THE MAN OF WAR
GATHERING UP HIS LEGS SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF REACH OF THE ALLIGATORS AND WITH A LONG POLE PUSHED HIMSELF OFF FROM SHORE SOMETIMES PADDLING AND SOMETIMES PUSHING HIS POLE AGAINST THE BOTTOM HE AT LAST GOT ACROSS THE RIVER AND TOOK UP HIS JOURNEY UPON DRY LAND
INFORMING THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND THAT THE CRUEL PIRATE L'OLONNOIS WAS IN A SHIP A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THEIR VILLAGE WHICH HE UNDOUBTEDLY INTENDED TO ATTACK WHEN THE GOVERNOR HEARD THIS ASTONISHING TALE
AND I DON'T SEE ANY SENSE IN FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND FIGHTING YET ALWAYS LOSING THROUGH SOME DERNED OLD LUNKHEAD OF A GENERAL
SO THAT LARGE SHIPS COULD NOT APPROACH VERY NEAR AND THUS THE VILLAGERS WERE KEPT BUSY CARRYING GOODS AND SUPPLIES IN SMALL BOATS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS FROM THE TOWN TO THE VESSELS AT ANCHOR
HE CRUISED ABOUT THE COAST AT SOME DISTANCE FROM DE LOS CAYOS ENDEAVORING TO PROCURE TWO SMALL BOATS IN WHICH TO APPROACH THE TOWN BUT ALTHOUGH HIS PREPARATIONS WERE MADE AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE THE PRESENCE OF HIS VESSEL WAS DISCOVERED BY SOME FISHERMEN
DON'T WE DO ALL THAT MEN CAN DEMANDED THE YOUTH LOUDLY HE WAS SECRETLY DUMFOUNDED AT THIS SENTIMENT WHEN IT CAME FROM HIS LIPS FOR A MOMENT HIS FACE LOST ITS VALOR AND HE LOOKED GUILTILY ABOUT HIM
IN A CLEAR SPACE THE TROOPS WERE AT LAST HALTED REGIMENTS AND BRIGADES BROKEN AND DETACHED THROUGH THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH THICKETS GREW TOGETHER AGAIN AND LINES WERE FACED TOWARD THE PURSUING BARK OF THE ENEMY'S INFANTRY
IN MANY'S LOOKS THE FALSE HEART'S HISTORY IS WRIT IN MOODS AND FROWNS AND WRINKLES STRANGE BUT HEAVEN IN THY CREATION DID DECREE THAT IN THY FACE SWEET LOVE SHOULD EVER DWELL
IT SUFFERS NOT IN SMILING POMP NOR FALLS UNDER THE BLOW OF THRALLED DISCONTENT
LIKE WIDOW'D WOMBS AFTER THEIR LORDS DECEASE YET THIS ABUNDANT ISSUE SEEM'D TO ME BUT HOPE OF ORPHANS AND UNFATHER'D FRUIT FOR SUMMER AND HIS PLEASURES WAIT ON THEE
SOME SAY THY GRACE IS YOUTH AND GENTLE SPORT BOTH GRACE AND FAULTS ARE LOV'D OF MORE AND LESS
WHICH LIKE A CANKER IN THE FRAGRANT ROSE DOTH SPOT THE BEAUTY OF THY BUDDING NAME
MURDEROUS BLOODY FULL OF BLAME SAVAGE EXTREME RUDE CRUEL NOT TO TRUST ENJOY'D NO SOONER BUT DESPISED STRAIGHT PAST REASON HUNTED
TAKE HEED DEAR HEART OF THIS LARGE PRIVILEGE
YET WELL I KNOW THAT MUSIC HATH A FAR MORE PLEASING SOUND I GRANT I NEVER SAW A GODDESS GO MY MISTRESS WHEN SHE WALKS TREADS ON THE GROUND
THY LOOKS WITH ME THY HEART IN OTHER PLACE FOR THERE CAN LIVE NO HATRED IN THINE EYE THEREFORE IN THAT I CANNOT KNOW THY CHANGE
THEY ARE BUT DRESSINGS OF A FORMER SIGHT OUR DATES ARE BRIEF AND THEREFORE WE ADMIRE WHAT THOU DOST FOIST UPON US THAT IS OLD AND RATHER MAKE THEM BORN TO OUR DESIRE THAN THINK THAT WE BEFORE HAVE HEARD THEM TOLD
NOR DID I WONDER AT THE LILY'S WHITE NOR PRAISE THE DEEP VERMILION IN THE ROSE THEY WERE BUT SWEET BUT FIGURES OF DELIGHT DRAWN AFTER YOU YOU PATTERN OF ALL THOSE
EXTREME A BLISS IN PROOF
ALL THESE I BETTER IN ONE GENERAL BEST THY LOVE IS BETTER THAN HIGH BIRTH TO ME RICHER THAN WEALTH PROUDER THAN GARMENTS COSTS
SING TO THE EAR THAT DOTH THY LAYS ESTEEM AND GIVES THY PEN BOTH SKILL AND ARGUMENT
BUT FOR HIS THEFT IN PRIDE OF ALL HIS GROWTH A VENGEFUL CANKER EAT HIM UP TO DEATH
TIS BETTER TO BE VILE THAN VILE ESTEEM'D WHEN NOT TO BE RECEIVES REPROACH OF BEING AND THE JUST PLEASURE LOST WHICH IS SO DEEM'D NOT BY OUR FEELING BUT BY OTHERS SEEING
AND THOU AWAY THE VERY BIRDS ARE MUTE OR IF THEY SING TIS WITH SO DULL A CHEER THAT LEAVES LOOK PALE DREADING THE WINTER'S NEAR
THEY RIGHTLY DO INHERIT HEAVEN'S GRACES AND HUSBAND NATURE'S RICHES FROM EXPENSE THEY ARE THE LORDS AND OWNERS OF THEIR FACES OTHERS BUT STEWARDS OF THEIR EXCELLENCE
WHILST MY POOR LIPS WHICH SHOULD THAT HARVEST REAP AT THE WOOD'S BOLDNESS BY THEE BLUSHING STAND TO BE SO TICKLED THEY WOULD CHANGE THEIR STATE AND SITUATION WITH THOSE DANCING CHIPS O'ER WHOM THY FINGERS WALK WITH GENTLE GAIT
IT FEARS NOT POLICY THAT HERETIC WHICH WORKS ON LEASES OF SHORT NUMBER'D HOURS BUT ALL ALONE STANDS HUGELY POLITIC THAT IT NOR GROWS WITH HEAT NOR DROWNS WITH SHOWERS TO THIS I WITNESS CALL
THY RECORD NEVER CAN BE MISS'D THAT POOR RETENTION COULD NOT SO MUCH HOLD NOR NEED I TALLIES THY DEAR LOVE TO SCORE THEREFORE TO GIVE THEM FROM ME WAS I BOLD
SOME IN THEIR HAWKS AND HOUNDS SOME IN THEIR HORSE AND EVERY HUMOUR HATH HIS ADJUNCT PLEASURE WHEREIN IT FINDS A JOY ABOVE THE REST BUT THESE PARTICULARS ARE NOT MY MEASURE
YET SEEM'D IT WINTER STILL AND YOU AWAY AS WITH YOUR SHADOW I WITH THESE DID PLAY
A TRUE SOUL WHEN MOST IMPEACH'D STANDS LEAST IN THY CONTROL
WHAT OLD DECEMBER'S BARENESS EVERYWHERE AND YET THIS TIME REMOVED WAS SUMMER'S TIME THE TEEMING AUTUMN BIG WITH RICH INCREASE BEARING THE WANTON BURDEN OF THE PRIME
DARKENING THY POWER TO LEND BASE SUBJECTS LIGHT RETURN FORGETFUL MUSE AND STRAIGHT REDEEM IN GENTLE NUMBERS TIME SO IDLY SPENT
THAT TONGUE THAT TELLS THE STORY OF THY DAYS MAKING LASCIVIOUS COMMENTS ON THY SPORT CANNOT DISPRAISE BUT IN A KIND OF PRAISE NAMING THY NAME BLESSES AN ILL REPORT
AND THEY MOURNERS SEEM AT SUCH WHO NOT BORN FAIR NO BEAUTY LACK SLAND'RING CREATION WITH A FALSE ESTEEM YET SO THEY MOURN
BY THEIR RANK THOUGHTS MY DEEDS MUST NOT BE SHOWN UNLESS THIS GENERAL EVIL THEY MAINTAIN ALL MEN ARE BAD AND IN THEIR BADNESS REIGN
THE ROSES FEARFULLY ON THORNS DID STAND ONE BLUSHING SHAME ANOTHER WHITE DESPAIR A THIRD NOR RED NOR WHITE HAD STOL'N OF BOTH AND TO HIS ROBBERY HAD ANNEX'D THY BREATH
SWEET BEAUTY HATH NO NAME NO HOLY BOWER BUT IS PROFAN'D IF NOT LIVES IN DISGRACE
HAPPY TO HAVE THY LOVE HAPPY TO DIE
WHICH SHALL ABOVE THAT IDLE RANK REMAIN BEYOND ALL DATE EVEN TO ETERNITY OR AT THE LEAST SO LONG AS BRAIN AND HEART HAVE FACULTY BY NATURE TO SUBSIST
THE ADULT FEMALES RANGED IN HEIGHT FROM TEN TO TWELVE FEET THE CHILDREN WERE LIGHT IN COLOR EVEN LIGHTER THAN THE WOMEN AND ALL LOOKED PRECISELY ALIKE TO ME EXCEPT THAT SOME WERE TALLER
WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIAR THE WEIGHT OF THESE RIFLES IS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE AND WITH THE SMALL CALIBER EXPLOSIVE RADIUM PROJECTILES WHICH THEY USE AND THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE BARREL
AND SO HUMAN LIFE HAS COME TO BE CONSIDERED BUT LIGHTLY ON MARS AS IS EVIDENCED BY THEIR DANGEROUS SPORTS AND THE ALMOST CONTINUAL WARFARE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES
IN ONE OF THE BUILDINGS FRONTING ON THE PLAZA AND WHICH FROM THE LITTER OF SILKS AND FURS UPON THE FLOOR I TOOK TO BE THE SLEEPING QUARTERS OF SEVERAL OF THE NATIVES THE ROOM WAS WELL LIGHTED BY A NUMBER OF LARGE WINDOWS
HIS ACTIONS SPOKE FOR THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WERE MOST DEAR TO MY HEART OF COURSE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BABBLING BROOK FOR ALL THE INTELLIGENCE MY SPEECH CARRIED TO HIM
HIS TWO LEFT ARMS WERE OUTSTRETCHED LATERALLY TO HELP PRESERVE HIS BALANCE THE THING HE RODE HAVING NEITHER BRIDLE OR REINS OF ANY DESCRIPTION FOR GUIDANCE AND HIS MOUNT
THESE LATTER ADD A MOST FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE TO AN OTHERWISE FEARSOME AND TERRIBLE COUNTENANCE AS THE LOWER TUSKS CURVE UPWARD TO SHARP POINTS WHICH END ABOUT WHERE THE EYES OF EARTHLY HUMAN BEINGS ARE LOCATED
THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A MARTIAN AFTER THE AGE OF MATURITY IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BUT WOULD BE NEARER THE ONE THOUSAND MARK WERE IT NOT FOR THE VARIOUS MEANS LEADING TO VIOLENT DEATH
AT THE SAME TIME HE MOTIONED HIS FOLLOWERS TO ADVANCE THEY STARTED TOWARD US ON A WILD RUN
AS I TURNED TO MEET IT UNARMED AND NAKED AS I WAS THE FIRST LAW OF NATURE MANIFESTED ITSELF IN THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF MY IMMEDIATE PROBLEM AND THAT WAS TO GET OUT OF THE VICINITY
AND THE GROTESQUE CARICATURES WHICH SAT BLINKING IN THE SUNLIGHT WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE ME TO DOUBT MY SANITY THEY SEEMED MOSTLY HEAD WITH LITTLE SCRAWNY BODIES LONG NECKS AND SIX LEGS OR
THE WHITENESS OF THE TEETH IS NOT THAT OF IVORY BUT OF THE SNOWIEST AND MOST GLEAMING OF CHINA AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF THEIR OLIVE SKINS THEIR TUSKS STAND OUT IN A MOST STRIKING MANNER
OF INCITANTS TO MERRIMENT THE DEATH AGONIES OF A FELLOW BEING ARE TO THESE STRANGE CREATURES PROVOCATIVE OF THE WILDEST HILARITY WHILE THEIR CHIEF FORM OF COMMONEST AMUSEMENT
IS TO INFLICT DEATH ON THEIR PRISONERS OF WAR IN VARIOUS INGENIOUS AND HORRIBLE WAYS THE ASSEMBLED WARRIORS AND CHIEFTAINS EXAMINED ME CLOSELY FEELING MY MUSCLES AND THE TEXTURE OF MY SKIN
HE SAT HIS MOUNT AS WE SIT A HORSE GRASPING THE ANIMAL'S BARREL WITH HIS LOWER LIMBS WHILE THE HANDS OF HIS TWO RIGHT ARMS HELD HIS IMMENSE SPEAR LOW AT THE SIDE OF HIS MOUNT
NOW COMMENCED A SERIES OF EVOLUTIONS WHICH EVEN THEN SEEMED LUDICROUS IN THE EXTREME I FOUND THAT I MUST LEARN TO WALK ALL OVER AGAIN
MY ATTEMPTS TO WALK RESULTED IN A VARIETY OF HOPS WHICH TOOK ME CLEAR OF THE GROUND A COUPLE OF FEET AT EACH STEP AND LANDED ME SPRAWLING UPON MY FACE OR BACK
AS TO STRIKE AGAINST THE BUTT OF HIS GREAT METAL SHOD SPEAR I SHOULD HAVE SNUFFED OUT WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THAT DEATH WAS NEAR ME BUT THE LITTLE SOUND CAUSED ME TO TURN
THEY ARE DEADLY IN THE EXTREME
WHEN EQUIPPED WITH THEIR WIRELESS FINDERS AND SIGHTERS IS BUT A TRIFLE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILES THIS IS QUITE FAR ENOUGH TO IMBUE ME WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE MARTIAN FIREARM
WHICH THEY EVIDENTLY WOULD NOT VOLUNTARILY ACCORD I THEREFORE IGNORED THE REPEATED COMMANDS TO SAK AND EACH TIME THEY WERE MADE I MOTIONED TO MY MOUTH AND RUBBED MY STOMACH
AND SO NOW I WENT SKIPPING AND FLITTING ABOUT AMONG THE DESKS AND CHAIRS LIKE SOME MONSTROUS GRASSHOPPER AFTER BRUISING MYSELF SEVERELY
AND AT A SIGN FROM THE LEADER I HAD BEEN LOWERED TO THE GROUND AGAIN LOCKING HIS ARM IN MINE WE HAD PROCEEDED INTO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THERE WERE FEW FORMALITIES OBSERVED IN APPROACHING THE MARTIAN CHIEFTAIN
FOR THE EFFORT WHICH ON EARTH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME STANDING UPRIGHT CARRIED ME INTO THE MARTIAN AIR TO THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT THREE YARDS I ALIGHTED SOFTLY UPON THE GROUND HOWEVER WITHOUT APPRECIABLE SHOCK OR JAR
NOR WAS THERE ROOM BENEATH THE DESKS FOR THEIR LONG LEGS EVIDENTLY THEN THERE WERE OTHER DENIZENS ON MARS THAN THE WILD AND GROTESQUE CREATURES INTO WHOSE HANDS I HAD FALLEN BUT THE EVIDENCES OF EXTREME ANTIQUITY
MAKING THESE WEAPONS PRESENT A SINGULARLY FORMIDABLE APPEARANCE MOST OF THESE DETAILS I NOTED LATER FOR I WAS GIVEN BUT LITTLE TIME TO SPECULATE ON THE WONDERS OF MY NEW DISCOVERY
WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH HIGHLY CARVED WOODEN DESKS AND CHAIRS WERE ASSEMBLED ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY MALE MARTIANS AROUND THE STEPS OF A ROSTRUM ON THE PLATFORM PROPER
UPON CLOSER OBSERVATION I SAW AS WE PASSED THEM THAT THE BUILDINGS WERE DESERTED AND WHILE NOT GREATLY DECAYED HAD THE APPEARANCE OF NOT HAVING BEEN TENANTED FOR YEARS POSSIBLY FOR AGES
IN SOME INSTANCES CURVING NEARLY TO THEIR HIGH SET EARS THEIR BODIES WERE SMALLER AND LIGHTER IN COLOR AND THEIR FINGERS AND TOES BORE THE RUDIMENTS OF NAILS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY LACKING AMONG THE MALES
WAS FULLY FIFTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT
THE LITTLE CALF ALWAYS REMAINED STANDING LIKE ONE WHICH WAS EATING AND THE COW HERD SAID IT WILL SOON RUN BY ITSELF JUST LOOK HOW IT EATS ALREADY AT NIGHT WHEN HE WAS GOING TO DRIVE THE HERD HOME AGAIN HE SAID TO THE CALF
LAST NIGHT OLD SANNA CARRIED SO MANY BUCKETS OF WATER INTO THE HOUSE THAT I ASKED HER WHY SHE WAS DOING THAT AND SHE SAID THAT IF I WOULD PROMISE NOT TO TELL ANYONE AND SHE SAID THAT EARLY TOMORROW MORNING WHEN FATHER WAS OUT HUNTING SHE WOULD SET THE KETTLE FULL OF WATER
AND YET HE AND HIS WIFE DID SO WISH TO HAVE ONE ONE DAY HE SAID TO HER LISTEN I HAVE A GOOD IDEA THERE IS OUR GOSSIP THE CARPENTER HE SHALL MAKE US A WOODEN CALF AND PAINT IT BROWN SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER AND IN TIME
IF YOU CAN STAND THERE AND EAT YOUR FILL YOU CAN ALSO GO ON YOUR FOUR LEGS I DON'T CARE TO DRAG YOU HOME AGAIN IN MY ARMS
BUT WE MUST MAKE A PROVISION FOR WINTER OR ELSE WE SHALL SUFFER FROM HUNGER SAID THE CAT AND YOU LITTLE MOUSE CANNOT VENTURE EVERYWHERE OR YOU WILL BE CAUGHT IN A TRAP SOME DAY THE GOOD ADVICE WAS FOLLOWED AND A POT OF FAT WAS BOUGHT BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO PUT IT
THE PARSON WENT TO THE CROWD AND DECLARED THAT THE MASS HAD BEEN SAID THEN THEY CAME AND ROLLED THE BARREL TOWARDS THE WATER WHEN THE BARREL BEGAN TO ROLL THE SHEPHERD CRIED I AM QUITE WILLING TO BE MAYOR THEY BELIEVED NO OTHERWISE
THEN THE WOMAN SERVED UP FOUR DIFFERENT THINGS ROAST MEAT SALAD CAKES AND WINE JUST AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO SIT DOWN AND EAT THERE WAS A KNOCKING OUTSIDE THE WOMAN SAID OH HEAVENS IT IS MY HUSBAND SHE QUICKLY HID THE ROAST MEAT INSIDE THE TILED STOVE
CAN HE FORETELL ANYTHING TO ME SAID THE MILLER WHY NOT ANSWERED THE PEASANT BUT HE ONLY SAYS FOUR THINGS AND THE FIFTH HE KEEPS TO HIMSELF THE MILLER WAS CURIOUS AND SAID
THEY MUST BE FOLLOWED INSTANTLY TO GET THEM BACK AGAIN THEN THE COOK SENT THREE SERVANTS AFTER THEM WHO WERE TO RUN AND OVERTAKE THE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN HOWEVER WERE SITTING OUTSIDE THE FOREST AND WHEN THEY SAW FROM AFAR THE THREE SERVANTS RUNNING LINA SAID TO FUNDEVOGEL NEVER LEAVE ME
FOR THE MOTHER HAD FALLEN ASLEEP UNDER THE TREE WITH THE CHILD
AND SET IT ON THE HIGH TREE THE FORESTER CLIMBED UP BROUGHT THE CHILD DOWN AND THOUGHT TO HIMSELF YOU WILL TAKE HIM HOME WITH YOU AND BRING HIM UP WITH YOUR LINA HE TOOK IT HOME THEREFORE AND THE TWO CHILDREN GREW UP TOGETHER AND THE ONE
AS THE CHILD HAS A WHITE RING ROUND ITS NECK I CANNOT REFUSE THE GOOD MOUSE CONSENTED BUT THE CAT CREPT BEHIND THE TOWN WALLS TO THE CHURCH AND DEVOURED HALF THE POT OF FAT NOTHING EVER SEEMS SO GOOD AS WHAT ONE KEEPS TO ONESELF
AT LENGTH AFTER MUCH CONSIDERATION THE CAT SAID I KNOW NO PLACE WHERE IT WILL BE BETTER STORED UP THAN IN THE CHURCH FOR NO ONE DARES TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THERE WE WILL SET IT BENEATH THE ALTAR AND NOT TOUCH IT UNTIL WE ARE REALLY IN NEED OF IT
THAN THAT IT WAS THE PEASANT WHO WAS SAYING THIS AND ANSWERED THAT IS WHAT WE INTEND BUT FIRST YOU SHALL LOOK ABOUT YOU A LITTLE DOWN BELOW THERE AND THEY ROLLED THE BARREL DOWN INTO THE WATER AFTER THAT THE PEASANTS WENT HOME
AND PEOPLE CARRY THE GOLD HOME IN SHOVELS THEN THE SMALL PEASANT WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE MAYOR AND BIDDEN TO SAY FROM WHENCE HIS WEALTH CAME HE ANSWERED I SOLD MY COW'S SKIN IN THE TOWN FOR THREE HUNDRED TALERS WHEN THE PEASANTS HEARD THAT THEY TOO WISHED TO ENJOY THIS GREAT PROFIT
ONLY IT HAS WHITE PAWS BUT WITH THAT EXCEPTION IT HAS NOT A SINGLE WHITE HAIR ON ITS WHOLE BODY THIS ONLY HAPPENS ONCE EVERY FEW YEARS YOU WILL LET ME GO WON'T YOU TOP OFF HALF DONE ANSWERED THE MOUSE THEY ARE SUCH ODD NAMES THEY MAKE ME VERY THOUGHTFUL
IT IS NO WORSE THAN CRUMB STEALER AS YOUR GODCHILDREN ARE CALLED BEFORE LONG THE CAT WAS SEIZED BY ANOTHER FIT OF YEARNING SHE SAID TO THE MOUSE YOU MUST DO ME A FAVOUR AND ONCE MORE MANAGE THE HOUSE FOR A DAY ALONE I AM AGAIN ASKED TO BE GODMOTHER AND
THEY SAID THEREFORE TO EACH OTHER WHAT CAN WE DO HERE LET US GO HOME WHEN THEY GOT HOME THE COOK ASKED IF THEY HAD NOT FOUND THEM SO THEY SAID NO THEY HAD FOUND NOTHING BUT A CHURCH AND THERE WAS A CHANDELIER IN IT AND THE COOK SCOLDED THEM AND SAID
AND WHEN THE COW HERD DROVE THE COWS THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND THE CALF WAS MISSING HE INQUIRED WHERE IT WAS THE COW HERD ANSWERED IT IS STILL STANDING OUT THERE EATING IT WOULD NOT STOP AND COME WITH US BUT THE LITTLE PEASANT SAID
WHEN SHE WENT HOME THE MOUSE INQUIRED AND WHAT WAS THE CHILD CHRISTENED HALF DONE ANSWERED THE CAT HALF DONE
SHE WOULD NEVER REPEAT IT TO ANYONE AND THEN THE COOK SAID EARLY TOMORROW MORNING WHEN THE FORESTER IS OUT HUNTING I WILL HEAT THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS BOILING IN THE KETTLE I WILL THROW IN FUNDEVOGEL AND WILL BOIL HIM IN IT EARLY NEXT MORNING THE FORESTER GOT UP AND WENT OUT HUNTING
YOU FOOLS WHY DID YOU NOT PULL THE CHURCH TO PIECES AND BRING THE CHANDELIER HOME WITH YOU AND NOW THE OLD COOK HERSELF GOT ON HER LEGS AND WENT WITH THE THREE SERVANTS IN PURSUIT OF THE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN HOWEVER SAW FROM AFAR THAT THE THREE SERVANTS WERE COMING
IN THE MEANTIME CAME THE PARSON THE MILLER'S WIFE RECEIVED HIM WELL AND SAID MY HUSBAND IS OUT SO WE WILL HAVE A FEAST THE PEASANT LISTENED AND WHEN HE HEARD THEM TALK ABOUT FEASTING HE WAS VEXED THAT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO MAKE SHIFT WITH A SLICE OF BREAD AND CHEESE
YOU WILL ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD ENJOY STICKING THAT DAINTY TONGUE OF YOURS OUT OF THE WINDOW THEY SET OUT ON THEIR WAY BUT WHEN THEY ARRIVED THE POT OF FAT CERTAINLY WAS STILL IN ITS PLACE BUT IT WAS EMPTY ALAS SAID THE MOUSE NOW I SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW IT COMES TO LIGHT
I NEVER HEARD THE NAME IN MY LIFE I'LL WAGER ANYTHING IT IS NOT IN THE CALENDAR THE CAT'S MOUTH SOON BEGAN TO WATER FOR SOME MORE LICKING ALL GOOD THINGS GO IN THREES SAID SHE I AM ASKED TO STAND GODMOTHER AGAIN THE CHILD IS QUITE BLACK
AND DID NOT GO ONCE ONLY BUT MANY TIMES OUT TO THE SPRING LINA SAW THIS AND SAID LISTEN OLD SANNA WHY ARE YOU FETCHING SO MUCH WATER IF YOU WILL NEVER REPEAT IT TO ANYONE I WILL TELL YOU WHY SO LINA SAID NO
IT WILL CERTAINLY GET BIG AND BE A COW THE WOMAN ALSO LIKED THE IDEA AND THEIR GOSSIP THE CARPENTER CUT AND PLANED THE CALF AND PAINTED IT AS IT OUGHT TO BE AND MADE IT WITH ITS HEAD HANGING DOWN AS IF IT WERE EATING NEXT MORNING WHEN THE COWS WERE BEING DRIVEN OUT
THE HONEST HANDS AND I WAS SOON TO SEE IT PROVED THAT THERE WERE SUCH ON BOARD MUST HAVE BEEN VERY STUPID FELLOWS OR RATHER I SUPPOSE THE TRUTH WAS THIS THAT ALL HANDS WERE DISAFFECTED BY THE EXAMPLE OF THE RINGLEADERS ONLY SOME MORE SOME LESS
HE FAIRLY OUTSTRIPPED HIMSELF IN WILLINGNESS AND CIVILITY HE WAS ALL SMILES TO EVERYONE IF AN ORDER WERE GIVEN
HERE AT THAT SAME MOMENT CAME NEWS OF ANOTHER FAR AWAY OUT IN THE MARSH THERE AROSE ALL OF A SUDDEN A SOUND LIKE THE CRY OF ANGER THEN ANOTHER ON THE BACK OF IT AND THEN ONE HORRID LONG DRAWN SCREAM
THE SLIGHTEST ORDER WAS RECEIVED WITH A BLACK LOOK AND GRUDGINGLY AND CARELESSLY OBEYED EVEN THE HONEST HANDS MUST HAVE CAUGHT THE INFECTION FOR THERE WAS NOT ONE MAN ABOARD TO MEND ANOTHER MUTINY IT WAS PLAIN
FOR NOT ONLY DID THEY CEASE TO DRAW ANY NEARER BUT THE BIRDS THEMSELVES BEGAN TO GROW MORE QUIET AND TO SETTLE AGAIN TO THEIR PLACES IN THE SWAMP AND NOW I BEGAN TO FEEL THAT I WAS NEGLECTING MY BUSINESS
WHY SAID THE CATERPILLAR HERE WAS ANOTHER PUZZLING QUESTION AND AS ALICE COULD NOT THINK OF ANY GOOD REASON AND AS THE CATERPILLAR SEEMED TO BE IN A VERY UNPLEASANT STATE OF MIND SHE TURNED AWAY
IN A JIFFY I HAD SLIPPED OVER THE SIDE AND CURLED UP IN THE FORE SHEETS OF THE NEAREST BOAT AND ALMOST AT THE SAME MOMENT SHE SHOVED OFF NO ONE TOOK NOTICE OF ME ONLY THE BOW OAR SAYING IS THAT YOU JIM KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN
WHICH SHE FOUND TO BE NOTHING BUT THE TOPS OF THE TREES UNDER WHICH SHE HAD BEEN WANDERING WHEN A SHARP HISS MADE HER DRAW BACK IN A HURRY A LARGE PIGEON HAD FLOWN INTO HER FACE AND WAS BEATING HER VIOLENTLY WITH ITS WINGS SERPENT SCREAMED THE PIGEON
NOT YOU AS SURE AS GOD SEES ME I'D SOONER LOSE MY HAND IF I TURN AGIN MY DOOTY AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A NOISE I HAD FOUND ONE OF THE HONEST HANDS WELL
WHEN THE GUN FIRED HOW SHOULD I DARE TO GO DOWN TO THE BOATS AMONG THOSE FIENDS STILL SMOKING FROM THEIR CRIME WOULD NOT THE FIRST OF THEM WHO SAW ME WRING MY NECK LIKE A SNIPE'S
A PECULIAR STAGNANT SMELL HUNG OVER THE ANCHORAGE A SMELL OF SODDEN LEAVES AND ROTTING TREE TRUNKS I OBSERVED THE DOCTOR SNIFFING AND SNIFFING LIKE SOMEONE TASTING A BAD EGG I DON'T KNOW ABOUT TREASURE HE SAID
HEARKENING AS SILENT AS A MOUSE ANOTHER VOICE ANSWERED AND THEN THE FIRST VOICE WHICH I NOW RECOGNIZED TO BE SILVER'S ONCE MORE TOOK UP THE STORY AND RAN ON FOR A LONG WHILE IN A STREAM
AND YOU'VE MONEY TOO WHICH LOTS OF POOR SAILORS HASN'T AND YOU'RE BRAVE OR I'M MISTOOK
AND IT PUT THE HOOKAH INTO ITS MOUTH AND BEGAN SMOKING AGAIN THIS TIME ALICE WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL IT CHOSE TO SPEAK AGAIN IN A MINUTE OR TWO THE CATERPILLAR TOOK THE HOOKAH OUT OF ITS MOUTH AND YAWNED ONCE OR TWICE AND SHOOK ITSELF
THE ROCKS OF THE SPY GLASS RE ECHOED IT A SCORE OF TIMES THE WHOLE TROOP OF MARSH BIRDS ROSE AGAIN DARKENING HEAVEN WITH A SIMULTANEOUS WHIRR AND LONG AFTER THAT DEATH YELL WAS STILL RINGING IN MY BRAIN
AND ANOTHER OF THE CREW STOOD FACE TO FACE IN CONVERSATION THE SUN BEAT FULL UPON THEM SILVER HAD THROWN HIS HAT BESIDE HIM ON THE GROUND AND HIS GREAT SMOOTH BLOND FACE
I'M AFRAID I AM SIR SAID ALICE I CAN'T REMEMBER THINGS AS I USED AND I DON'T KEEP THE SAME SIZE FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THINGS SAID THE CATERPILLAR WELL
AND ADDRESSED HER IN A LANGUID SLEEPY VOICE WHO ARE YOU SAID THE CATERPILLAR THIS WAS NOT AN ENCOURAGING OPENING FOR A CONVERSATION ALICE REPLIED RATHER SHYLY I
WHY I HAVEN'T HAD A WINK OF SLEEP THESE THREE WEEKS I'M VERY SORRY YOU'VE BEEN ANNOYED SAID ALICE WHO WAS BEGINNING TO SEE ITS MEANING AND JUST AS I'D TAKEN THE HIGHEST TREE IN THE WOOD CONTINUED THE PIGEON RAISING ITS VOICE TO A SHRIEK
LEAPING BACK A YARD AS IT SEEMED TO ME WITH THE SPEED AND SECURITY OF A TRAINED GYMNAST HANDS OFF IF YOU LIKE JOHN SILVER SAID THE OTHER IT'S A BLACK CONSCIENCE THAT CAN MAKE YOU FEARED OF ME BUT IN HEAVEN'S NAME TELL ME WHAT WAS THAT
HUNG OVER US LIKE A THUNDER CLOUD AND IT WAS NOT ONLY WE OF THE CABIN PARTY WHO PERCEIVED THE DANGER LONG JOHN WAS HARD AT WORK GOING FROM GROUP TO GROUP SPENDING HIMSELF IN GOOD ADVICE AND AS FOR EXAMPLE NO MAN COULD HAVE SHOWN A BETTER
I HARDLY KNOW SIR JUST AT PRESENT AT LEAST I KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I GOT UP THIS MORNING BUT I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT SAID THE CATERPILLAR STERNLY EXPLAIN YOURSELF
AND THE BOATS HAD TO BE GOT OUT AND MANNED AND THE SHIP WARPED THREE OR FOUR MILES ROUND THE CORNER OF THE ISLAND AND UP THE NARROW PASSAGE TO THE HAVEN BEHIND SKELETON ISLAND I VOLUNTEERED FOR ONE OF THE BOATS WHERE I HAD OF COURSE NO BUSINESS
ANOTHER FOLLOWED AND SOON OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE OF THE MARSH A GREAT CLOUD OF BIRDS HUNG SCREAMING AND CIRCLING IN THE AIR I JUDGED AT ONCE THAT SOME OF MY SHIPMATES MUST BE DRAWING NEAR ALONG THE BORDERS OF THE FEN NOR WAS I DECEIVED
AND NOW WHICH IS WHICH SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND NIBBLED A LITTLE OF THE RIGHT HAND BIT TO TRY THE EFFECT THE NEXT MOMENT SHE FELT A VIOLENT BLOW UNDERNEATH HER CHIN IT HAD STRUCK HER FOOT
AND WITHOUT TAKING ANY NOTICE I HAD DRAWN NEAR TO THE FOOT OF THE LITTLE HILL WITH THE TWO PEAKS AND HAD GOT INTO A PART OF THE ISLAND WHERE THE LIVE OAKS GREW MORE WIDELY APART AND SEEMED MORE LIKE FOREST TREES IN THEIR BEARING AND DIMENSIONS
THESE AND OTHER WORDS FELL FROM THEIR MOUTHS LIKE POISONED ARROWS AIMED AT THE RUIN OF CORVETTO AS AT A TARGET ALAS FOR HIM WHO IS CONDEMNED TO THAT DEN THE COURT WHERE FLATTERY IS SOLD BY THE KILDERKIN
ANTONIELLO FLEW INTO A RAGE WITH FEAR OF THE CONSEQUENCES AND ABUSED HIS SON BUT CIENZO ANSWERED SIR I HAVE ALWAYS HEARD SAY THAT BETTER IS THE LAW COURT THAN THE DOCTOR IN ONE'S HOUSE WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN WORSE IF HE HAD BROKEN MY HEAD
WITH SO MANY OTHER PRETTY THINGS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE A BETTER MEMORY AND MORE TIME THAN I HAVE TO RELATE THEM WHEN THE COURTIERS CAME TO THE KING WHO WAS THUS TRANSPORTED WITH JOY THEY SAID TO HIM
MALIGNITY AND ILL OFFICES ARE MEASURED OUT IN BUSHELS DECEIT AND TREACHERY ARE WEIGHED BY THE TON BUT WHO CAN COUNT ALL THE ATTEMPTS THESE COURTIERS MADE TO BRING HIM TO GRIEF
SO TWO OF THE COURTIERS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THE DOG UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE TAVERN WHERE THEY FOUND CIENZO AND DELIVERING THE MESSAGE FROM THE KING THEY CONDUCTED HIM TO THE PALACE INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE KING
WHERE THE RECEPTION HE MET WITH FROM THE KING AND THE VEXATION OF THE COURTIERS WHO WERE BURSTING WITH SPITE ARE NOT TO BE TOLD NEVERTHELESS THEY LAID A PLAN TO FALL UPON CORVETTO WITH THE REAR GUARD OF THEIR ROGUERY AND WENT AGAIN TO THE KING
THEN THE PRINCE TOLD HIM TO GO NEARER TO THE FISH AND SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER FOR PERHAPS THIS ADVENTURE MIGHT CONCERN HIM AS SOON AS NENNILLO APPROACHED THE FISH IT RAISED UP ITS HEAD UPON THE ROCK AND OPENING ITS THROAT SIX PALMS WIDE
WHEN THE KING HEARD THIS HE TOOK THE CROWN FROM THE HEAD OF THAT FALSE LOON
FEEDING ON ACORNS AND CHESTNUTS WHICH THEY FOUND FALLEN ON THE GROUND BUT AS HEAVEN ALWAYS EXTENDS ITS ARM OVER THE INNOCENT THERE CAME BY CHANCE A PRINCE TO HUNT IN THAT WOOD THEN NENNILLO HEARING THE BAYING OF THE HOUNDS WAS SO FRIGHTENED
WHERE CORVETTO SPEEDILY STONED THEM TO DEATH THEN HE SHUT THE DOOR AND TOOK THE KEYS TO THE KING WHO SEEING THE VALOUR AND CLEVERNESS OF THE LAD IN SPITE OF ILL FORTUNE AND THE ENVY AND ANNOYANCE OF THE COURTIERS GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER TO WIFE
AS THEIR SLANDER WAS NOT BELIEVED THEY THOUGHT OF LEADING HIM TO DISASTER BY THE PATH OF FLATTERY WHICH THEY ATTEMPTED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER TEN MILES DISTANT FROM SCOTLAND WHERE THE SEAT OF THIS KING WAS
IT IS BETTER TO SCAMPER OFF AND USE YOUR OWN HEELS THAN TO BE TOUCHED BY ANOTHER'S BETTER TO THROW YOUR LEGS OVER YOUR BACK THAN TO CARRY YOUR HEAD BETWEEN TWO LEGS IF YOU DON'T TAKE YOUR KNAPSACK AND BE OFF NONE OF THE SAINTS CAN HELP YOU
TAKE THIS TREASURE WHICH IS DESTINED FOR THEE ALONE BUT MIND AND TAKE CARE OF IT THEN THEY VANISHED AND CIENZO
IN ORDER NOT TO TAKE A FALSE STEP WELL KNOWING THAT THE FORTUNE OF COURTIERS IS AS GLASS BUT THE HIGHER THE LAD CONTINUED TO RISE THE LOWER THE OTHERS FELL TILL AT LAST BEING PUZZLED TO KNOW HOW TO TAKE HIM OFF HIS FEET
HOW COMES HE BY THIS LUCK THAT NOT A DAY PASSES THAT HE RECEIVES SOME NEW FAVOURS WHILST WE ARE FOR EVER GOING BACKWARD LIKE A ROPE MAKER AND GETTING FROM BAD TO WORSE THOUGH WE SLAVE LIKE DOGS TOIL LIKE FIELD LABOURERS
I'VE CAUGHT HIM AND
HAVING BY THE FAVOUR OF SOL IN LEO SAVED THY LIFE I HEAR THAT ANOTHER PLUMES HIMSELF WITH MY LABOURS THAT ANOTHER CLAIMS THE REWARD OF THE SERVICE WHICH I RENDERED THOU THEREFORE WHO WAST PRESENT AT THE DRAGON'S DEATH
ONLY YESTERDAY YOU WERE ILL IN BED AND NOW YOU ARE SLAVING THUS AND HAVE NO PITY ON YOUR OWN FLESH WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO REPLIED THE OGRESS I HAVE NO ONE TO HELP ME I AM HERE
NENNELLA STEPPED OUT SO BEAUTIFUL THAT SHE LOOKED JUST LIKE A NYMPH IN SOME INTERLUDE COME FORTH FROM THAT ANIMAL AT THE INCANTATION OF A MAGICIAN AND WHEN THE PRINCE ASKED HER HOW IT HAD ALL HAPPENED SHE TOLD HIM A PART OF HER SAD STORY
WHICH MADE SUCH A FURIOUS BARKING THAT THE PRINCE SENT TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE AND WHEN HE DISCOVERED THE PRETTY LITTLE BOY WHO WAS SO YOUNG THAT HE COULD NOT TELL WHO WERE HIS FATHER AND MOTHER HE ORDERED ONE OF THE HUNTSMEN TO SET HIM UPON HIS SADDLE AND TAKE HIM TO THE ROYAL PALACE
IT WAS HE WHO BEGAN AND PROVOKED ME WE ARE BUT BOYS AND THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THE QUARREL AFTER ALL TIS A FIRST FAULT AND THE KING IS A MAN OF REASON BUT LET THE WORST COME TO THE WORST WHAT GREAT HARM CAN HE DO ME THE WIDE WORLD IS ONE'S HOME
AND STUPOR IS IN DELIGHT THE KING WHO HAD A FRUITFUL BRAIN WHICH CONCEIVED QUICKLY CALLED CORVETTO AGAIN AND TELLING HIM THE GREAT LONGING THAT HAD SEIZED HIM FOR THE OGRE'S PALACE BEGGED HIM TO ADD THIS SERVICE TO ALL THE OTHERS HE HAD DONE HIM
SEVERED THE PRISON BARS OF HIS WIFE'S SOUL HE TOOK TO HIMSELF A CRUEL WOMAN WHO HAD NO SOONER SET FOOT IN HIS HOUSE THAN SHE BEGAN TO RIDE THE HIGH HORSE SAYING AM I COME HERE INDEED TO LOOK AFTER OTHER FOLK'S CHILDREN A PRETTY JOB I HAVE UNDERTAKEN
BE ON YOUR GUARD CORVETTO IS RIDING OFF WITH ME AT THIS ALARM THE OGRE INSTANTLY SET OUT WITH ALL THE ANIMALS THAT SERVED HIM TO CUT CORVETTO IN PIECES FROM THIS SIDE JUMPED AN APE
I KISS THY DELICATE LITTLE HANDS FROM THE INN OF THE FLOWER POT SUNDAY HAVING WRITTEN THIS LETTER AND SEALED IT WITH A WAFER HE PLACED IT IN THE MOUTH OF THE ENCHANTED DOG SAYING
HERE I STAND AND LET A RASCALLY THIEF CHEAT ME OUT OF MY TRUMP CARD SO SAYING HE TOOK AN INKSTAND SEIZED A PEN AND SPREADING OUT A SHEET OF PAPER BEGAN TO WRITE TO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL JEWEL OF WOMEN MENECHELLA
WHO WAS ALMOST BESIDE HIMSELF WITH DELIGHT AT THE TAPESTRY WHICH WAS NOT ONLY OF SILK EMBROIDERED WITH GOLD BUT HAD BESIDES MORE THAN A THOUSAND DEVICES AND THOUGHTS WORKED ON IT AND AMONGST THE REST IF I REMEMBER RIGHT
BEHOLD THE DRAGON'S HEADS WHICH ARE THE PROOFS OF MY VALOUR THEREFORE RECOLLECT EVERY PROMISE IS A DEBT AS SOON AS THE KING HEARD THIS HE LIFTED THE CROWN FROM HIS OWN HEAD AND SET IT UPON THE COUNTRYMAN'S POLL WHO LOOKED LIKE A THIEF ON THE GALLOWS
AND FROM OUR DIFFERENT SITUATIONS IN LIFE FROM HIS BEING SO MUCH MORE IN THE WORLD THAN ME AND OUR CONTINUAL SEPARATION
TO COMPREHEND ALL THE DIFFICULTIES THAT MUST HAVE PERPLEXED THE ENGAGEMENT AND RETARDED THE MARRIAGE OF EDWARD AND HERSELF HAD HE BEEN OTHERWISE FREE AND SHE HAD SEEN ALMOST ENOUGH TO BE THANKFUL FOR HER OWN SAKE
NO PRIDE NO HAUTEUR AND YOUR SISTER JUST THE SAME ALL SWEETNESS AND AFFABILITY ELINOR WISHED TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT LUCY STILL PRESSED HER TO OWN THAT SHE HAD REASON FOR HER HAPPINESS AND ELINOR WAS OBLIGED TO GO ON
FOR I WAS SOMEHOW OR OTHER AFRAID I HAD OFFENDED YOU BY WHAT I TOLD YOU THAT MONDAY OFFENDED ME HOW COULD YOU SUPPOSE SO BELIEVE ME AND ELINOR SPOKE IT WITH THE TRUEST SINCERITY
LUCY LOOKED AT ELINOR AGAIN AND WAS SILENT
AND IT WAS ONLY ON THE SUPPOSITION OF HIS BEING SPONTANEOUSLY SOLICITED BY SOME MOST UNEXCEPTIONABLE APPLICANT ON HIS OWN TERMS AND AS A GREAT FAVOUR THAT HE WOULD LET IT AT ALL HOW QUICK COME THE REASONS FOR APPROVING WHAT WE LIKE
AND I AM SO GLAD YOUR SISTER IS GOING TO BE WELL MARRIED I HOPE YOU WILL BE A GREAT DEAL AT COMBE MAGNA IT IS A SWEET PLACE BY ALL ACCOUNTS YOU HAVE BEEN LONG ACQUAINTED WITH COLONEL BRANDON HAVE NOT YOU YES
I AM GLAD OF IT WITH ALL MY HEART BUT REALLY YOU DID NOT LOOK IT
AND ANCIENT DIGNITY TO SUPPORT IN ANY OTHER PLACE SIR WALTER MIGHT JUDGE FOR HIMSELF AND WOULD BE LOOKED UP TO AS REGULATING THE MODES OF LIFE IN WHATEVER WAY HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO MODEL HIS HOUSEHOLD SIR WALTER WOULD QUIT
FOR SHE LOITERED AWAY SEVERAL MINUTES ON THE LANDING PLACE WITH THE MOST HIGH MINDED FORTITUDE BEFORE SHE WENT TO HER SISTER WHEN THAT WAS ONCE DONE HOWEVER IT WAS TIME FOR THE RAPTURES OF EDWARD TO CEASE FOR MARIANNE'S JOY HURRIED HER INTO THE DRAWING ROOM IMMEDIATELY
KELLYNCH HALL AND AFTER A VERY FEW DAYS MORE OF DOUBT AND INDECISION THE GREAT QUESTION OF WHITHER HE SHOULD GO WAS SETTLED AND THE FIRST OUTLINE OF THIS IMPORTANT CHANGE MADE OUT THERE HAD BEEN THREE ALTERNATIVES LONDON BATH
HER PLEASURE IN SEEING HIM WAS LIKE EVERY OTHER OF HER FEELINGS STRONG IN ITSELF AND STRONGLY SPOKEN SHE MET HIM WITH A HAND THAT WOULD BE TAKEN AND A VOICE THAT EXPRESSED THE AFFECTION OF A SISTER
AND OF HER BEING PARTICULARLY DISGUSTED WITH HIS MOTHER TILL THEY WERE MORE IN PRIVATE BUT WHY WERE YOU NOT THERE EDWARD WHY DID YOU NOT COME I WAS ENGAGED ELSEWHERE
YOUR BROTHER MIGHT BE PERSUADED TO GIVE HIM NORLAND LIVING WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS A VERY GOOD ONE AND THE PRESENT INCUMBENT NOT LIKELY TO LIVE A GREAT WHILE THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR US TO MARRY UPON
AND UNDER MANY CIRCUMSTANCES IT NATURALLY WOULD DURING A FOUR YEARS ENGAGEMENT
THERE IS STILL MORE DUE TO THE CHARACTER OF AN HONEST MAN
I FELT SURE THAT YOU WAS ANGRY WITH ME AND HAVE BEEN QUARRELLING WITH MYSELF EVER SINCE FOR HAVING TOOK SUCH A LIBERTY AS TO TROUBLE YOU WITH MY AFFAIRS BUT I AM VERY GLAD TO FIND IT WAS ONLY MY OWN FANCY AND THAT YOU REALLY DO NOT BLAME ME
FOR LADY MIDDLETON'S DELIGHTED WITH MISSUS DASHWOOD SO WE SHALL BE A GOOD DEAL IN HARLEY STREET I DARE SAY AND EDWARD SPENDS HALF HIS TIME WITH HIS SISTER BESIDES LADY MIDDLETON AND MISSUS FERRARS WILL VISIT NOW
SHE WAS A BENEVOLENT CHARITABLE GOOD WOMAN AND CAPABLE OF STRONG ATTACHMENTS MOST CORRECT IN HER CONDUCT STRICT IN HER NOTIONS OF DECORUM AND WITH MANNERS THAT WERE HELD A STANDARD OF GOOD BREEDING
UPON MY WORD REPLIED ELINOR YOU KNOW MUCH MORE OF THE MATTER THAN I DO IF YOU HAVE ANY REASON TO EXPECT SUCH A MATCH
WITH ALMOST EVERY OTHER MAN IN THE WORLD IT WOULD BE AN ALARMING PROSPECT BUT EDWARD'S AFFECTION AND CONSTANCY NOTHING CAN DEPRIVE ME OF I KNOW THAT CONVICTION MUST BE EVERY THING TO YOU AND HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY SUPPORTED BY THE SAME TRUST IN YOUR'S
AND NEVER LOOKED AT ME IN A PLEASANT WAY YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN IF I HAD BEEN TREATED IN THAT FORBIDDING SORT OF WAY
THE VISIT OF THE MISS STEELES AT BARTON PARK WAS LENGTHENED FAR BEYOND WHAT THE FIRST INVITATION IMPLIED THEIR FAVOUR INCREASED THEY COULD NOT BE SPARED SIR JOHN WOULD NOT HEAR OF THEIR GOING AND IN SPITE OF THEIR NUMEROUS AND LONG ARRANGED ENGAGEMENTS IN EXETER
IT WAS TREATED BY THE FORMER WITH CALMNESS AND CAUTION AND DISMISSED AS SOON AS CIVILITY WOULD ALLOW FOR SHE FELT SUCH CONVERSATIONS TO BE AN INDULGENCE WHICH LUCY DID NOT DESERVE AND WHICH WERE DANGEROUS TO HERSELF
FOR HIS HEART HAD NOT THE INDIFFERENCE OF LUCY'S NOR COULD HIS CONSCIENCE HAVE QUITE THE EASE OF ELINOR'S LUCY WITH A DEMURE AND SETTLED AIR SEEMED DETERMINED TO MAKE NO CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMFORT OF THE OTHERS
BUT ELINOR HAD MORE TO DO
INDEED I AM BOUND TO LET YOU INTO THE SECRET FOR YOU ARE A PARTY CONCERNED
WHILE HER EYES BRIGHTENED AT THE INFORMATION IT WOULD HAVE GAVE ME SUCH PLEASURE TO MEET YOU THERE BUT I DARE SAY YOU WILL GO FOR ALL THAT TO BE SURE YOUR BROTHER AND SISTER WILL ASK YOU TO COME TO THEM
AND LUCY WAS STILL THE FIRST TO END IT SHALL YOU BE IN TOWN THIS WINTER MISS DASHWOOD SAID SHE WITH ALL HER ACCUSTOMARY COMPLACENCY CERTAINLY NOT I AM SORRY FOR THAT RETURNED THE OTHER
ELINOR HARDLY KNEW WHETHER TO SMILE OR SIGH AT THIS ASSERTION LUCY WENT ON
SHE WANTED IT TO BE PRESCRIBED AND FELT AS A DUTY SHE RATED LADY RUSSELL'S INFLUENCE HIGHLY AND AS TO THE SEVERE DEGREE OF SELF DENIAL WHICH HER OWN CONSCIENCE PROMPTED SHE BELIEVED THERE MIGHT BE LITTLE MORE DIFFICULTY IN PERSUADING THEM TO A COMPLETE THAN TO HALF A REFORMATION
THAT MUST BE RECOMMENDATION ENOUGH TO HER HUSBAND BUT MISSUS JOHN DASHWOOD WOULD NOT MUCH APPROVE OF EDWARD'S GOING INTO ORDERS THEN I RATHER SUSPECT THAT MY INTEREST WOULD DO VERY LITTLE
IT WILL BE QUITE DELIGHTFUL MY LOVE APPLYING TO HER HUSBAND DON'T YOU LONG TO HAVE THE MISS DASHWOODS COME TO CLEVELAND CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WITH A SNEER I CAME INTO DEVONSHIRE WITH NO OTHER VIEW
RETORTED DOCTOR JOHNSON WITH SOME ASPERITY OF COURSE COMPLAINT BOOKS ARE FOR THE RECEPTION OF COMPLAINTS NOBODY DISPUTES THAT
WHAT SPLENDID HAIR EXCLAIMED THE BARBER HOW MUCH WILL YOU GIVE ME FOR IT SAID SHE
IF WE COULD HAVE HAD POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS IN MY DAY I MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD TO FALL ON MY SWORD TO GET OUT OF KEEPING AN ENGAGEMENT I HAD NO FANCY FOR CLASS CLUBS HAVE THEIR USES NO DOUBT SAID DEMOSTHENES
SHAKESPEARE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND TOSSED UP AN OBOLUS HEADS BACON TAILS POOL WITH NERO AND JOHNSON HE SAID THE COIN CAME DOWN WITH HEADS UP AND SHAKESPEARE WENT INTO THE POOL ROOM
I THOUGHT HOUSE COMMITTEES WERE NOT EXPECTED TO PAY ANY ATTENTION TO COMPLAINTS IN COMPLAINT BOOKS I NEVER HEARD OF ITS BEING DONE BEFORE WELL I CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE EITHER REPLIED DEMOSTHENES CHEWING THOUGHTFULLY ON THE PEBBLE
ARE THE FRONT TEETH THE TWO UPPER ONES HOW HORRIBLE EXCLAIMED FANTINE TWO NAPOLEONS GRUMBLED A TOOTHLESS OLD WOMAN WHO WAS PRESENT
A RAG WHICH SHE CALLED HER COVERLET A MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR AND A SEATLESS CHAIR STILL REMAINED A LITTLE ROSEBUSH WHICH SHE HAD HAD DRIED UP FORGOTTEN IN ONE CORNER IN THE OTHER CORNER WAS A BUTTER POT TO HOLD WATER WHICH FROZE IN WINTER
MOST POETS PREFER TO RUB OUT THE RIGHT WORD GROWLED CONFUCIUS BESIDES I SHALL NEVER CONSENT TO SLATES IN THIS HOUSE BOAT THE SQUEAKING OF THE PENCILS WOULD BE WORSE THAN THE POEMS THEMSELVES THAT'S TRUE
GOOD SHOT SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON NONCHALANTLY
WE MUST STICK TO OUR ORIGINAL IDEA THEN LET US DO SOMETHING TO ABATE THE NUISANCE OF WHICH I COMPLAIN SAID CONFUCIUS CAN'T WE ADOPT A HOUSE RULE
ONE OF THOSE ATTICS WHOSE EXTREMITY FORMS AN ANGLE WITH THE FLOOR AND KNOCKS YOU ON THE HEAD EVERY INSTANT THE POOR OCCUPANT CAN REACH THE END OF HIS CHAMBER AS HE CAN THE END OF HIS DESTINY ONLY BY BENDING OVER MORE AND MORE SHE HAD NO LONGER A BED
AND STARED COLDLY AT NERO DID YOU SEND FOR ME WILLIAM HE ASKED LANGUIDLY I DID SAID SHAKESPEARE
I DO NOT SMOKE I CAN'T PLAY BILLIARDS AND I DO NOT KNOW A TREY OF DIAMONDS FROM A SILVER SALVER ALL I CAN DO IS WRITE POETRY WHY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ME BY ALL MEANS LET US HAVE A POETS CORNER WHERE A MAN CAN BE INSPIRED IN PEACE
I THINK THE POETS CORNER ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY SAID CONFUCIUS THIS ISN'T A CLASS ORGANIZATION AND WE SHOULD RESIST ANY EFFORT TO MAKE IT OR ANY PORTION OF IT SO
IT WAS THE MONEY THAT THEY WANTED THEY GAVE THE PETTICOAT TO EPONINE THE POOR LARK CONTINUED TO SHIVER FANTINE THOUGHT MY CHILD IS NO LONGER COLD I HAVE CLOTHED HER WITH MY HAIR
AND IN VIEW OF THE AGE OF THE COMPLAINANTS I THINK WE CANNOT WELL DECLINE TO GIVE THEM A SPECIFIC ANSWER RESPECT FOR AGE IS DE RIGUEUR AT ALL TIMES LIKE CLEAN HANDS I'LL SECOND THE MOTION
SAID CASSIUS I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT IF A DOZEN POETS GOT TO WORK ON THOSE SLATES AT ONCE A FIFE CORPS WOULDN'T BE A CIRCUMSTANCE TO THEM WELL IT ALL GOES TO PROVE WHAT I HAVE THOUGHT ALL ALONG SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON HOMER'S IDEA IS A GOOD ONE
SHE DEEPLY HATED FATHER MADELEINE BUT MADE NO COMPLAINT SHE SEWED SEVENTEEN HOURS A DAY BUT A CONTRACTOR FOR THE WORK OF PRISONS WHO MADE THE PRISONERS WORK AT A DISCOUNT SUDDENLY MADE PRICES FALL
UPON THE TOP OF WHICH STOOD A MAN DRESSED IN RED WHO WAS HOLDING FORTH HE WAS A QUACK DENTIST ON HIS ROUNDS WHO WAS OFFERING TO THE PUBLIC FULL SETS OF TEETH OPIATES POWDERS AND ELIXIRS
THE FIDDLING EX EMPEROR NERO SAID BACON LOUDLY ENOUGH TO BE HEARD ALL ABOUT THE ROOM IS MISTAKEN WHEN HE ATTRIBUTES OTHELLO TO ME AHA MASTER NERO CRIED SHAKESPEARE TRIUMPHANTLY WHAT DID I TELL YOU
HERE IS NOT VERY DEFINITE WHERE IS HERE IN THE COMPLAINT BOOK WHICH I HOLD IN MY HAND RETURNED DEMOSTHENES PUTTING A PEBBLE IN HIS MOUTH SO THAT HE MIGHT ENUNCIATE MORE CLEARLY A FROWN RUFFLED THE SERENITY OF DOCTOR JOHNSON'S BROW
SHE REMAINED THOUGHTFUL AND BEGAN HER WORK AT THE EXPIRATION OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE LEFT HER SEWING
OH NO SAID EMERSON OLD GOVERNOR WINTHROP IS TO BLAME FOR THAT WHEN HE SETTLED AT CHARLESTOWN HE SAW THE OLD INDIAN TOWN OF SHAWMUT ACROSS THE CHARLES AND SHAWMUT WAS THE BOSTON MICROBE WAS IT ASKED JOHNSON YES
TO SAY THAT THIS MAN SHALL NOT ENTER BECAUSE HE IS THIS OR THAT OR THE OTHER THING WOULD RESULT IN OUR ULTIMATELY BECOMING A CLASS ORGANIZATION WHICH AS CONFUCIUS HIMSELF SAYS WE ARE NOT AND MUST NOT BE
THERE'S ONE THING THIS HOUSE BOAT NEEDS WROTE HOMER IN THE COMPLAINT BOOK THAT ADORNED THE CENTRE TABLE IN THE READING ROOM AND THAT IS A POETS CORNER THERE ARE SMOKING ROOMS FOR THOSE WHO SMOKE BILLIARD ROOMS FOR THOSE WHO PLAY BILLIARDS AND A CARD ROOM FOR THOSE WHO PLAY CARDS
THOUGH I CAN'T SAY I THINK YOUR PARALLELS ARE VERY PARALLEL A SHOEMAKER MY DEAR CONFUCIUS IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM A POET CERTAINLY SAID DOCTOR JOHNSON VERY DIFFERENT IN FACT DIFFERENT ENOUGH TO MAKE A CONUNDRUM OF THE QUESTION
HER COUGH DID NOT LEAVE HER AND SHE HAD SWEATS ON HER BACK
BUT I SUPPOSE COMPLAINT BOOKS ARE THE PLACES FOR COMPLAINTS YOU DON'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO WRITE SERIAL STORIES OR DIALECT POEMS IN THEM DO YOU THAT ISN'T THE POINT AS THE MAN SAID TO THE ASSASSIN WHO TRIED TO STAB HIM WITH THE HILT OF HIS DAGGER
YOU CAN'T KILL ME SAID SHAKESPEARE SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS I KNOW SEVEN DOZEN ACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES WHO ARE TRYING TO DO IT BUT THEY CAN'T
IT'S ALL RIGHT TO PULL THE WOOL OVER THE EYES OF THE MORTALS THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE THERE FOR BUT AS FOR US WE'RE ALL IN THE SECRET HERE WHAT'S THE USE OF PUTTING ON NONSENSE WITH US WE'LL SEE IN A MINUTE WHAT THE USE IS RETORTED THE AVONIAN WE'LL HAVE BACON DOWN HERE
FOR FOUR DAYS THIS ENTRY LAY IN THE BOOK APPARENTLY UNNOTICED
THEN HE'S SAFE CONCLUDED FOLLIOT YOU'LL GET NOTHING FROM ME ABOUT HIM AND NOBODY CAN GET AT YOU EXCEPT THROUGH HIM ASKED BRYCE THAT'S ABOUT IT ASSENTED FOLLIOT LACONICALLY BRYCE LAUGHED CYNICALLY
AND WHO'S RANSFORD THEN I NEVER HEARD BRAKE SPEAK OF ANY RANSFORD WHAT GAME IS ALL THIS WHAT BEFORE BRYCE COULD REPLY FOLLIOT SUDDENLY STARTED THRUST HIS COMPANION ASIDE AND WENT TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS
AND CLOSE BEHIND HIM THE DETECTIVE
AT THE SIDE OF THE SEAT HE PASSED IT BACK JOHN LEXMAN READ IF YOU CANNOT SWIM THERE IS A LIFE BELT UNDER YOUR SEAT JOHN NODDED KARA WAS SEARCHING THE SEA FOR SOMETHING AND PRESENTLY HE FOUND IT
FOR THE DAY HE WAS TO PAINT SOME DOORS AND WINDOWS OF AN OUTLYING COTTAGE A COTTAGE OCCUPIED BY A WARDER WHO FOR SOME REASON ON THE DAY PREVIOUS HAD SPOKEN TO HIM
CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE THE OLD WELL HOUSE WHEN BRYCE CAME HURRYING UP TO HIM FOLLIOT WAS STANDING AT HIS GARDEN DOOR WITH HIS HANDS THRUST UNDER HIS COAT TAILS THE VERY PICTURE OF A BENEVOLENT LEISURED GENTLEMAN
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT THAT HE SHOULD SEE IT
UPON HIS HAGGARD FACE STANDING WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM HE WAITED FOR THE MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD BE ORDERED TO HIS WORK JOHN LEXMAN A O FORTY THREE
TO WHAT I KNOW FOLLIOT HAD ALLOWED HIS CIGAR TO GO OUT HE THREW IT AWAY TOOK A FRESH ONE FROM THE BOX AND SLOWLY STRUCK A MATCH AND LIGHTED IT WHAT MIGHT YOU KNOW NOW HE ASKED AFTER ANOTHER PAUSE
AND MOTIONED BRYCE TO ENTER QUIET ENOUGH IN HERE DOCTOR HE OBSERVED YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS PLACE BIT OF A FANCY OF MINE BRYCE ABSORBED AS HE WAS IN THE THOUGHTS OF THE MOMENT
REPLIED BRYCE PROMPTLY OF THE OTHER THE MAN OF LESSER IMPORTANCE FLOOD
NOW THEN WHO IS HE FOLLIOT REPLIED WITH A SHREWD GLANCE A MAN WHO BY GIVING AWAY ANOTHER MAN GAVE HIMSELF AWAY WOULD BE A DAMNED FOOL HE ANSWERED IF THERE IS ANOTHER MAN AS IF THERE MUST BE INTERRUPTED BRYCE
BEYOND THE VILLAGE OF PRINCETOWN AND ON THE TAVISTOCK ROAD
A PRETTY COIL HE SAID WITH A SNEER HERE YOU TALKED ABOUT MY PRICE I'M QUITE CONTENT TO HOLD MY TONGUE IF YOU'D TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO WHAT ASKED FOLLIOT YOU KNEW BRAKE
WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY TAKEN BY THE PRISON STAFF AND IT WAS TO THE DECORATION OF ONE OF THESE THAT A O FORTY THREE HAD BEEN SENT THE HOUSE WAS AS YET WITHOUT A TENANT A PAPER HANGER UNDER THE CHARGE OF ANOTHER WARDER
HE NODDED AT A BOX OF CIGARS WHICH LAY OPEN ON A TABLE AT BRYCE'S ELBOW AS HE BEGAN TO MIX A COUPLE OF DRINKS HELP YOURSELF HE SAID GOOD STUFF THOSE NOT UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN BRYCE A DRINK
OF HIS IMPRISONMENT HE HAD BEEN SENT TO DARTMOOR AFTER SPENDING THREE MONTHS IN WORMWOOD SCRUBBS OLD HANDS HAD TOLD HIM VARIOUSLY THAT HE WAS FORTUNATE OR UNLUCKY IT WAS USUAL TO HAVE TWELVE MONTHS AT THE SCRUBBS
BUT BRYCE SAW THAT HIS COOL ALMOST INDIFFERENT MANNER WAS CHANGING HE WAS BEGINNING UNDER THE SURFACE TO GET ANXIOUS WHEN I LEFT GLASSDALE AT NOON CONTINUED BRYCE I'D NO IDEA AND I DON'T THINK HE HAD
AND THEN TO HIS LEFT HAND FALKINER WRAYE HE SAID HAD AN UNFORTUNATE GUN ACCIDENT IN HIS YOUTH WHICH MARKED HIM FOR LIFE HE LOST THE MIDDLE FINGER OF HIS LEFT HAND AND HE GOT A BAD SCAR ON HIS LEFT JAW THERE THEY ARE THOSE MARKS
HE WAS EVIDENTLY THINKING DEEPLY AND BRYCE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO DISTURB HIM SOME MINUTES WENT BY BEFORE FOLLIOT TOOK THE CIGAR FROM HIS LIPS AND LEANING AGAINST THE CHIMNEYPIECE LOOKED FIXEDLY AT HIS VISITOR LOOK HERE MY LAD HE SAID EARNESTLY
BRYCE LOOKED IN THE DIRECTION POINTED OUT BEHIND THE PERGOLA OF RAMBLER ROSES THE FIGURES OF MEN WERE COMING TOWARDS THE OLD WELL HOUSE LED BY ONE OF FOLLIOT'S GARDENERS SUDDENLY THEY EMERGED INTO FULL VIEW
BRAKE HAD EVIDENTLY A BELIEF IN THESE MEN AND HE TRUSTED THEM UNFORTUNATELY FOR HIMSELF HE SOMETIMES TRUSTED THE BANK'S MONEY TO THEM I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HE USED TO LET THEM HAVE MONEY FOR SHORT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS TO BE REFUNDED
I WAS PUT AWAY BY A WOMAN AFTER THREE OF US HAD GOT CLEAR WITH TWELVE THOUSAND POUNDS DAMN ROUGH LUCK WASN'T IT JOHN NODDED IT WAS CURIOUS HE THOUGHT HOW SYMPATHETIC ONE GROWS WITH THESE EXPONENTS OF CRIMES
IN THAT PART OF FOLLIOT'S BIG GARDEN I WANT A BIT OF TALK WITH YOU SAID BRYCE AS FOLLIOT CLOSED THE DOOR AND TURNED DOWN A SIDE PATH TO A STILL MORE RETIRED REGION PRIVATE TALK LET'S GO WHERE IT'S QUIET
AND EVENTUALLY HE CAME BACK AND MARRIED A RICH WIDOW AND SETTLED HIMSELF DOWN IN AN OUT OF THE WORLD ENGLISH TOWN TO GROW ROSES YOU'RE FALKINER WRAYE YOU KNOW MISTER FOLLIOT BRYCE LAUGHED AS HE MADE THIS DIRECT ACCUSATION
IT WAS ALL SO INCREDIBLE SO IMPOSSIBLE HE EXPECTED TO WAKE UP
NOT MUCH IN THAT FOR THE REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE STORY HE CONTINUED BUT BRAKE HAD OTHER ASSOCIATIONS WITH BARTHORPE A BIT LATER HE GOT TO KNOW GOT INTO CLOSE TOUCH WITH A BARTHORPE MAN WHO ABOUT THE TIME OF BRAKE'S MARRIAGE
BUT AS WHO HE REALLY WAS JOHN BRAKE THAT WAS AT A PLACE CALLED BRADEN MEDWORTH NEAR BARTHORPE IN LEICESTERSHIRE HE PAUSED THERE WATCHING FOLLIOT BUT FOLLIOT SHOWED NO MORE THAN CLOSE ATTENTION AND BRYCE WENT ON
WHAT'S INCREDIBLE ASKED FOLLIOT
HE WAS A MAN OF TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE LITHE AND ALERT BY NO MEANS BAD LOOKING
DUCHESS WENT HOME AND BRUSHED HER BEAUTIFUL BLACK COAT AND THEN SHE PICKED A BUNCH OF FLOWERS IN HER GARDEN AS A PRESENT FOR RIBBY AND PASSED THE TIME UNTIL THE CLOCK STRUCK FOUR
O CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN O CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN OUR FEARFUL TRIP IS DONE THE SHIP HAS WEATHER'D EVERY RACK THE PRIZE WE SOUGHT IS WON THE PORT IS NEAR THE BELLS I HEAR THE PEOPLE ALL EXULTING
A ROPE WALK WON'T BE IN IT WITH HER
AND HOW SHALL I DECK MY SONG FOR THE LARGE SWEET SOUL THAT HAS GONE AND WHAT SHALL MY PERFUME BE FOR THE GRAVE OF HIM I LOVE
FROM ME TO THEE GLAD SERENADES
BY GETTING IN HER FINE WORK AHEAD OF HIS EXPLAINED HENRIETTE HE POINTED HER OUT TO ME IN PICCADILLY ONCE AND I HAVE NEVER FORGOTTEN HER FACE I HOPE SHE DID NOT RECOGNIZE YOU I OBSERVED
AND THE ARMIES THAT REMAIN'D SUFFER'D SIXTEEN PASSING THE VISIONS PASSING THE NIGHT PASSING UNLOOSING THE HOLD OF MY COMRADES HANDS PASSING THE SONG OF THE HERMIT BIRD AND THE TALLYING SONG OF MY SOUL
REMEMBER BUNNY CALM DELIBERATION YOUR GLOVES NOW WERE HER LAST WORDS TO ME
AND GIMCRACKS GENERALLY THAT SHE BROUGHT HOME WITH HER AFTER HER CALLS UPON OR DINNERS WITH LADIES OF FASHION THAT SHE HAD THAT QUALITY OF TRUE GENIUS WHICH NEVER OVERLOOKS THE SMALLEST DETAILS THE FIRST BIG COUP AFTER MY ARRIVAL AS THE RESULT OF HER GENIUS
EIGHT O WESTERN ORB SAILING THE HEAVEN
I DON'T BELIEVE MISTER DE PELT REMEMBERS NOW THAT HE WAS AT THE ROCKERBILTS LAST NIGHT AND EVEN IF HE DOES YOU KNOW THAT I WAS IN THIS HOUSE AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK I BUNNY
AND IN ORDER TO QUIET ALL SUSPICION OF MY REAL STATUS IN THE VAN RAFFLES HOUSEHOLD I WAS COMPELLED TO ACT THE PART IN A FASHION WHICH REVOLTED ME OTHERWISE THE POSITION WAS PLEASANT AND
SHE POPPED HER PIE INTO THE OVEN THERE WERE TWO OVENS ONE ABOVE THE OTHER SOME OTHER KNOBS AND HANDLES WERE ONLY ORNAMENTAL AND NOT INTENDED TO OPEN
I TOOK HIM TO HIS APARTMENT DISMISSED THE CAB AND LETTING OURSELVES INTO HIS ROOM WITH HIS OWN LATCH KEY PUT HIM TO BED HIS CLOTHES I TOOK AS A WELL ORDERED VALET SHOULD FROM HIS BED CHAMBER INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHERE AFTER REMOVING THE CONTENTS OF HIS POCKETS
I WAS INSTALLED AT BOLIVAR LODGE AS HEAD BUTLER AND STEWARD MY SALARY TO CONSIST OF WHAT I COULD MAKE OUT OF IT ON THE SIDE
WITH WHOM I WAS PERFORCE REQUIRED TO ASSOCIATE THIS WENT VERY MUCH AGAINST THE GRAIN AT FIRST FOR
AND THEN BACK TO ENGLAND FOR FIAMETTA
THE SONG THE WONDROUS CHANT OF THE GRAY BROWN BIRD
NOTHING OF THE SORT BUNNY JUST DO AS I TELL YOU
BETTER CALL IT THE INCIDENT I PUT IN
OH YES YES FETCH DOCTOR MAGGOTTY MY DEAR RIBBY HE IS A PIE HIMSELF HE WILL CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND RIBBY SETTLED DUCHESS IN AN ARMCHAIR BEFORE THE FIRE AND WENT OUT AND HURRIED TO THE VILLAGE TO LOOK FOR THE DOCTOR SHE FOUND HIM AT THE SMITHY
BUT I SAW THEY WERE NOT AS WAS THOUGHT THEY THEMSELVES WERE FULLY AT REST THEY SUFFER'D NOT
AND THEN I UNFOLDED TO HER THE INCIDENTS OF THE NIGHT BEFORE WHEN BY ASSUMING AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE THE POSITION OF VALET
BUT I WITH MOURNFUL TREAD WALK THE DECK MY CAPTAIN LIES FALLEN COLD AND DEAD HUSH'D BE THE CAMPS TO DAY MAY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE HUSH'D BE THE CAMPS TO DAY AND SOLDIERS LET US DRAPE OUR WAR WORN
YES THERE WAS MY DEAR RIBBY I AM SURE I HAVE SWALLOWED IT LET ME PROP YOU UP WITH A PILLOW MY DEAR DUCHESS WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU FEEL IT OH I DO FEEL SO ILL ALL OVER ME MY DEAR RIBBY
SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF THE TOP OVEN OUT CAME A RICH STEAMY FLAVOUR OF VEAL AND HAM AND THERE STOOD A FINE BROWN PIE
THERE WASN'T ANYTHING HE WOULDN'T DO FOR ME
I THANK YOU KINDLY LITTLE DOG I FARE AS WELL AS YOU OLD RHYME ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A PUSSY CAT CALLED RIBBY WHO INVITED A LITTLE DOG CALLED DUCHESS TO TEA COME IN GOOD TIME MY DEAR DUCHESS SAID RIBBY'S LETTER
SONG OF THE BLEEDING THROAT DEATH'S OUTLET SONG OF LIFE FOR WELL DEAR BROTHER I KNOW
LO BODY AND SOUL THIS LAND
IT DID NOT TAKE ME MANY DAYS TO DISCOVER THAT HENRIETTE WAS A WORTHY SUCCESSOR TO HER LATE HUSBAND FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONAL PROFIT ESCAPED HER EYE AND I WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE AS TIME WENT ON AND I NOTED THE ACCUMULATION OF SPOONS FORKS NUTCRACKERS
SITTING BEFORE THE FIRE SIGHING AND GROANING AND FEELING VERY UNHAPPY HOW COULD I HAVE SWALLOWED IT SUCH A LARGE THING AS A PATTY PAN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND STARED MOURNFULLY AT THE GRATE
I BREAK THE SPRIGS FROM THE BUSHES
WITH ALL THE MOURNFUL VOICES OF THE DIRGES POUR'D AROUND THE COFFIN THE DIM LIT CHURCHES AND THE SHUDDERING ORGANS WHERE AMID THESE YOU JOURNEY
FOR THE GOOD OF OUR CAUSE IT IS MY TASK TO LOSE STEADILY AND WITH GOOD GRACE THIS ESTABLISHES MY CREDIT PROVES MY AMIABILITY AND CONFIRMS MY POPULARITY
SHE SAT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE TO WAIT FOR THE LITTLE DOG
IT IS A VERY ODD THING THAT RIBBY'S PIE WAS NOT IN THE OVEN WHEN I PUT MINE IN AND I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE I HAVE LOOKED ALL OVER THE HOUSE I PUT MY PIE INTO A NICE HOT OVEN AT THE TOP I COULD NOT TURN ANY OF THE OTHER HANDLES
WHERE THEN I ASKED WITH MISSUS A J VAN RAFFLES REPLIED HENRIETTE THE FACT IS SHE ADDED I HAVE ALREADY ENGAGED HER SHE HAS ACTED HER PART WELL
AS THE MAID OF MISSUS A J VAN RAFFLES TO HER EAGLE EYE IT WAS ANOTHER PROMISING FIELD FOR PROFIT FOR HENRIETTE HAD SPARED NEITHER PAINS NOR MONEY TO IMPRESS FIAMETTA WITH THE IDEA THAT NEXT TO MISSUS GASTER SHE WAS ABOUT AS LAVISH AND FINANCIALLY CAPABLE A HOUSEHOLDER
THE TOP OVEN BAKES TOO QUICKLY SAID RIBBY TO HERSELF
OH DEAR HOW VERY UNFORTUNATE CRIED HENRIETTE
FOR THE SURE ENWINDING ARMS OF COOL ENFOLDING DEATH DARK MOTHER ALWAYS GLIDING NEAR WITH SOFT FEET HAVE NONE CHANTED FOR THEE A CHANT OF FULLEST WELCOME THEN I CHANT IT FOR THEE I GLORIFY THEE ABOVE ALL
AND I IN THE MIDDLE AS WITH COMPANIONS AND AS HOLDING THE HANDS OF COMPANIONS I FLED FORTH TO THE HIDING RECEIVING NIGHT THAT TALKS NOT DOWN TO THE SHORES OF THE WATER THE PATH BY THE SWAMP IN THE DIMNESS
FROM VARIOUS TRADESMEN OF THE TOWN I RECEIVED PRESENTS OF NO LITTLE VALUE IN THE FORM SOMETIMES OF DIAMOND SCARF PINS GOLD LINK SLEEVE BUTTONS CASES OF FINE WINES FOR MY OWN USE AND IN ONE OR TWO INSTANCES CHECKS OF SUBSTANTIAL VALUE
OF THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF MISSUS GASTER'S JEWELS
AND SHE GAVE HER LETTER TO THE POSTMAN BUT SHE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT RIBBY'S PIE
SEASON TO YOUR TASTE WITH WINE NUTMEG AND BUTTER OAT MEAL GRUEL
SEVERAL TIMES WE SHIPPED A LITTLE WATER AND MY BREECHES AND THE TAILS OF MY COAT WERE ALL SOAKING WET BEFORE WE HAD GONE A HUNDRED YARDS THE CAPTAIN MADE US TRIM THE BOAT
FOR WE HAD ALL QUIETLY MADE UP OUR MINDS TO TREAT HIM LIKE ONE OF OURSELVES SUDDENLY THE CAPTAIN SPOKE UP AGAIN AND I THOUGHT HIS VOICE WAS A LITTLE CHANGED
THEN WARM IT AND PUT IN A LITTLE SALT
AND LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION I SAW THE OTHER PIRATES TROOPING OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES AND TUMBLING INTO THEIR PLACES IN THE BOATS
WINE WHEY
OR WHETHER THEY WERE LAZY AND WOULD NOT I DO NOT KNOW HOWEVER THEY TOOK IT INTO THEIR HEADS THAT IT DID NOT BECOME THEM TO GO HOME ON FOOT SO CHANTICLEER BEGAN TO BUILD A LITTLE CARRIAGE OF NUTSHELLS AND WHEN IT WAS FINISHED
AND DELAYING OUR ASSAILANTS THE ONE SOURCE OF DANGER WAS THE GUN IF I DURST SAID THE CAPTAIN I'D STOP AND PICK OFF ANOTHER MAN
IT IS A VERY GOOD WAY TO MAKE IT VERY THICK AND THIN IT AFTERWARDS WITH MILK SAGO WASH THE SAGO ALLOWING TWO TABLE SPOONSFUL TO A QUART OF WATER AND SOAK IT AN HOUR
AND IF NICELY WARMED OVER IS AS GOOD AS WHEN FRESH CORN GRUEL
BUT DO NOT LET IT BURN PUT IT IN A PITCHER AND POUR BOILING WATER ON IT TOAST WATER WILL ALLAY THIRST BETTER THAN ALMOST ANY THING ELSE IF IT IS WANTED TO DRINK THROUGH THE NIGHT IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE MADE EARLY IN THE EVENING
AS FOR THE CAPTAIN HE HAD CARRIED HIS OVER HIS SHOULDER BY A BANDOLEER AND LIKE A WISE MAN LOCK UPPERMOST THE OTHER THREE HAD GONE DOWN WITH THE BOAT
AND BROKE ALL HER GOODS INTO A THOUSAND PIECES THEN SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND KNEW NOT WHAT TO DO AH WHAT WILL BECOME OF ME SAID SHE WHAT WILL MY HUSBAND SAY
JACK ASHORE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THEM I MIND IT'S THE ROUND SHOT CARPET BOWLS MY LADY'S MAID COULDN'T MISS TELL US SQUIRE
AND HAVING DONE THIS THEY CREPT AWAY AS SOFTLY AS POSSIBLE HOWEVER THE DUCK WHO SLEPT IN THE OPEN AIR IN THE YARD HEARD THEM COMING AND JUMPING INTO THE BROOK WHICH RAN CLOSE BY THE INN SOON SWAM OUT OF THEIR REACH
TO MISTER KORBES THE FOX TODAY SOON AFTER CAME UP A MILLSTONE AN EGG A DUCK AND A PIN AND CHANTICLEER GAVE THEM ALL LEAVE TO GET INTO THE CARRIAGE AND GO WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT MISTER KORBES'S HOUSE
BUT IT MADE HER FINGERS VERY SORE I SEE THIS WORK WON'T DO SAID HE TRY AND SPIN PERHAPS YOU WILL DO THAT BETTER SO SHE SAT DOWN AND TRIED TO SPIN
OR JUST ABOUT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE WAY WE OUGHT TO GO WE'LL NEVER GET ASHORE AT THIS RATE SAID I IF IT'S THE ONLY COURSE THAT WE CAN LIE SIR WE MUST EVEN LIE IT
THAT HAD BEEN LAID TO DRY OVER A BAKER'S OVEN AND THUS SHE HAD SOME JOKE TO CRACK UPON EVERY ONE BUT SHE LAUGHED MORE THAN ALL AT A GOOD KING WHO WAS THERE LOOK AT HIM SAID SHE
WHILE THIS WAS PASSING A DUCK CAME QUACKING UP AND CRIED OUT YOU THIEVING VAGABONDS WHAT BUSINESS HAVE YOU IN MY GROUNDS I'LL GIVE IT YOU WELL FOR YOUR INSOLENCE
IF THE ROOM IS KEPT PERFECTLY STILL BOILED CUSTARD BEAT AN EGG WITH A HEAPED TEA SPOONFUL OF SUGAR STIR IT INTO A TEA CUPFUL OF BOILING MILK AND STIR TILL IT IS THICK
HAD BEEN AT A PUBLIC HOUSE A FEW MILES OFF AND HAD SAT DRINKING TILL THEY HAD FORGOTTEN HOW LATE IT WAS HE BEGGED THEREFORE THAT THE TRAVELLERS WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO GIVE THEM A LIFT IN THEIR CARRIAGE
YOU MUST TRAVEL ON WITH YOUR HUSBAND
IT IS A COOLING DRINK IN FEVERS IF THE WEATHER IS COLD YOU CAN MAKE A LARGER QUANTITY SOME BOIL WHOLE RAISINS WITH BARLEY TAKE IT WITH OR WITHOUT SEASONING TO POACH EGGS
TRELAWNEY WAS AS COOL AS STEEL HE LOOKED TO THE PRIMING OF HIS GUN NOW CRIED THE CAPTAIN EASY WITH THAT GUN SIR OR YOU'LL SWAMP THE BOAT
BUT WHEN HE STIRRED IT UP THE EGGSHELLS FLEW INTO HIS EYES AND ALMOST BLINDED HIM BLESS ME SAID HE ALL THE WORLD SEEMS TO HAVE A DESIGN AGAINST MY HEAD THIS MORNING
BESIDES THE CHANCE OF BEING BOARDED BY THE GIGS WHEREAS THE WAY WE GO THE CURRENT MUST SLACKEN AND THEN WE CAN DODGE BACK ALONG THE SHORE
AND CONVEYS NUTRIMENT IN A FORM THAT WILL HARDLY DISAGREE WITH THE MOST DELICATE STOMACH AND HAS BEEN TAKEN WHEN NEARLY ALL OTHER FOOD WAS REJECTED A FEW DROPS OF VINEGAR AND A LITTLE SALT RENDERS IT MORE PALATABLE
NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR THE JOLLY BOAT'S LAST TRIP THIS FIFTH TRIP WAS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANY OF THE OTHERS IN THE FIRST PLACE
ALL HANDS STAND BY TO TRIM HER WHEN HE AIMS THE SQUIRE RAISED HIS GUN THE ROWING CEASED
SAID MORTIMER GLANCING RATHER SHRINKINGLY TOWARDS THE BUNK IS IT HERE TAIN'T NOT TO SAY HERE BUT IT'S CLOSE BY I DO EVERYTHING REG'LAR
TO THE TURNING OF STEAM PADDLES TO THE CLINKING OF IRON CHAIN TO THE CREAKING OF BLOCKS TO THE MEASURED WORKING OF OARS TO THE OCCASIONAL VIOLENT BARKING OF SOME PASSING DOG ON SHIPBOARD WHO SEEMED TO SCENT THEM LYING IN THEIR HIDING PLACE
YET IN SPITE OF HAVING THOSE WEIGHTS ON HIS CONSCIENCE EUGENE WAS SOMEWHAT ENLIVENED BY THE LATE SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF AFFAIRS SO WERE HIS TWO COMPANIONS ITS BEING A CHANGE WAS EVERYTHING THE SUSPENSE SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN A NEW LEASE AND TO HAVE BEGUN AFRESH FROM A RECENT DATE
AMONG BOW SPLITS STARING INTO WINDOWS AND WINDOWS STARING INTO SHIPS THE WHEELS ROLLED ON UNTIL THEY STOPPED AT A DARK CORNER RIVER WASHED AND OTHERWISE NOT WASHED AT ALL WHERE THE BOY ALIGHTED AND OPENED THE DOOR YOU MUST WALK THE REST SIR IT'S NOT MANY YARDS
TASTES LIKE THE WASH OF THE RIVER ARE YOU SO FAMILIAR WITH THE FLAVOUR OF THE WASH OF THE RIVER I SEEM TO BE TO NIGHT I FEEL AS IF I HAD BEEN HALF DROWNED AND SWALLOWING A GALLON OF IT INFLUENCE OF LOCALITY SUGGESTED LIGHTWOOD
ALWAYS WELL DISPOSED TO ASSIST THE CONSTITUTED AUTHORITIES MISS ABBEY BADE BOB GLIDDERY ATTEND THE GENTLEMEN TO THAT RETREAT AND PROMPTLY ENLIVEN IT WITH FIRE AND GASLIGHT
DOWN BY WHERE ACCUMULATED SCUM OF HUMANITY SEEMED TO BE WASHED FROM HIGHER GROUNDS LIKE SO MUCH MORAL SEWAGE AND TO BE PAUSING UNTIL ITS OWN WEIGHT FORCED IT OVER THE BANK AND SUNK IT IN THE RIVER
I AM FAR FROM BEING CLEAR AS TO THE LAST PARTICULAR RETURNED MORTIMER WITH GREAT COMPOSURE THAT I HAVE MUCH ADVANTAGE OVER YOU I HATE SAID EUGENE PUTTING HIS LEGS UP ON THE OPPOSITE SEAT I HATE MY PROFESSION
IN FACT WE HAVING BEEN A FAMILY IMMERSED TO THE CROWNS OF OUR HEADS IN LIME DURING SEVERAL GENERATIONS
MORTIMER APOSTROPHIZED HIM LAUGHING QUITE HEARTILY WHEN THEY WERE ALONE AGAIN HOW CAN YOU BE SO RIDICULOUS I AM IN A RIDICULOUS HUMOUR QUOTH EUGENE I AM A RIDICULOUS FELLOW EVERYTHING IS RIDICULOUS COME ALONG
MORTIMER INQUIRED AS HE SOUGHT FOR HIS HAT YOU WOULDN'T ASK SIR IF YOU KNEW HIS STATE
THERE WAS A CURIOUS MIXTURE IN THE BOY OF UNCOMPLETED SAVAGERY AND UNCOMPLETED CIVILIZATION HIS VOICE WAS HOARSE AND COARSE AND HIS FACE WAS COARSE AND HIS STUNTED FIGURE WAS COARSE BUT HE WAS CLEANER THAN OTHER BOYS OF HIS TYPE AND HIS WRITING THOUGH LARGE AND ROUND WAS GOOD
MORTIMER RANG THE BELL TO PAY THE SCORE AND BOB APPEARED TO TRANSACT THAT BUSINESS WITH HIM WHOM EUGENE IN HIS CARELESS EXTRAVAGANCE ASKED IF HE WOULD LIKE A SITUATION IN THE LIME TRADE THANKEE SIR NO SIR SAID BOB I'VE A GOOD SITIWATION HERE SIR
THEIR RETREAT WAS SO CHOSEN THAT WHILE THEY COULD WATCH THE RIVER THEY COULD WATCH THE HOUSE NO ONE HAD PASSED IN OR OUT SINCE THE DAUGHTER THOUGHT SHE HEARD THE FATHER CALLING NO ONE COULD PASS IN OR OUT WITHOUT BEING SEEN BUT IT WILL BE LIGHT AT FIVE SAID MISTER INSPECTOR
WHICH I CHERISH NEXT TO MY LIFE BEING PRESENT I THINK IT MIGHT BE A MORE AGREEABLE PROCEEDING TO THE ASSISTING BYSTANDERS THAT IS TO SAY LIME BURNERS I ALSO SAID LIGHTWOOD PUSHING HIS FRIEND ASIDE WITH A LAUGH SHOULD MUCH PREFER THAT
BUT THE WHOLE WAS VERY INDISTINCTLY SEEN IN THE OBSCURITY OF THE NIGHT THE BOY LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE DOOR AND THEY PASSED AT ONCE INTO A LOW CIRCULAR ROOM WHERE A MAN STOOD BEFORE A RED FIRE LOOKING DOWN INTO IT AND A GIRL SAT ENGAGED IN NEEDLEWORK
PRECISELY MY VIEW OF THE CASE EUGENE BUT SHOW ME A GOOD OPPORTUNITY SHOW ME SOMETHING REALLY WORTH BEING ENERGETIC ABOUT AND I'LL SHOW YOU ENERGY AND SO WILL I SAID EUGENE
I AM QUITE AS BAD SAID LIGHTWOOD SITTING UP FACING HIM WITH A TUMBLED HEAD AFTER GOING THROUGH SOME WONDERFUL EVOLUTIONS IN WHICH HIS HEAD HAD BEEN THE LOWEST PART OF HIM THIS RESTLESSNESS BEGAN WITH ME LONG AGO
AND FORASMUCH AS CROUCHING UNDER THE LEE OF A HAULED UP BOAT ON A NIGHT WHEN IT BLEW COLD AND STRONG AND WHEN THE WEATHER WAS VARIED WITH BLASTS OF HAIL AT TIMES
YOU'LL MAKE OUT THAT THERE'S A SPECK OF SOMETHING OR ANOTHER THERE AND YOU'LL KNOW IT'S ME AND YOU'LL COME DOWN THAT CAUSE'AY TO ME UNDERSTOOD ALL UNDERSTOOD ALL OFF SHE GOES THEN IN A MOMENT WITH THE WIND CUTTING KEENLY AT HIM SIDEWAYS HE WAS STAGGERING DOWN TO HIS BOAT
OF THIS COMMISSION THE BARE ARMED BOB LEADING THE WAY WITH A FLAMING WISP OF PAPER SO SPEEDILY ACQUITTED HIMSELF THAT COSY SEEMED TO LEAP OUT OF A DARK SLEEP AND EMBRACE THEM WARMLY THE MOMENT THEY PASSED THE LINTELS OF ITS HOSPITABLE DOOR
THEY PRETTY WELL PAPERS THE ROOM YOU SEE BUT I KNOW EM ALL I'M SCHOLAR ENOUGH HE WAVED THE LIGHT OVER THE WHOLE AS IF TO TYPIFY THE LIGHT OF HIS SCHOLARLY INTELLIGENCE AND THEN PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE AND STOOD BEHIND IT LOOKING INTENTLY AT HIS VISITORS
HAS FOR SOME TIME PAST GIVEN THE OTHER MAN A BAD NAME ARISING OUT OF YOUR LIME BARGES AND THAT THE OTHER MAN HAS BEEN AVOIDED IN CONSEQUENCE I DON'T SAY WHAT IT MEANS OR PROVES BUT IT'S A CERTAIN FACT
THAT PART OF THE BANK HAVING RANK GRASS GROWING ON IT THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN GETTING CLOSE WITHOUT ANY NOISE OF FOOTSTEPS IT WAS BUT TO SCRAMBLE UP A RAGGED FACE OF PRETTY HARD MUD SOME THREE OR FOUR FEET HIGH AND COME UPON THE GRASS AND TO THE WINDOW HE CAME TO THE WINDOW BY THAT MEANS
PLACING THESE ON THE TABLE AND BENDING OVER THE FIRE MERITORIOUSLY SENSIBLE OF THE TRYING NATURE OF HIS DUTY HE WATCHED THE WREATHS OF STEAM
THE MESSENGER ON THE BOX BESIDE THE DRIVER LET ME SEE SAID MORTIMER AS THEY WENT ALONG
FOR THE JOLLY FELLOWSHIP PORTERS ARE NOT THE JOLLIEST DOGS I HAVE KNOWN BUT I SUPPOSE WE ARE BEST HERE UNTIL THEY TURN US OUT WITH THE OTHER SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS AT MIDNIGHT
THERE MAY TURN OUT TO BE SOMETHING CONSIDERABLE FOR HIM THAT COMES IN SECOND AND I DON'T MENTION WHO MAY OR WHO MAY NOT TRY FOR THAT PLACE
AS THE TIME SO PASSED THIS SLINKING BUSINESS BECAME A MORE AND MORE PRECARIOUS ONE
MAY BE ENDOWED WITH PHILANTHROPY ENOUGH TO TURN BOTTOM UPWARD AND EXTINGUISH HIM MORTIMER MY HONOURABLE FRIEND THREE BURGLARIES TWO FORGERIES AND A MIDNIGHT ASSASSINATION
IF THE REAL MAN FEELS AS GUILTY AS I DO SAID EUGENE HE IS REMARKABLY UNCOMFORTABLE INFLUENCE OF SECRECY SUGGESTED LIGHTWOOD
WHO HAD OPENED A PRISON WALL AND LET OUT A CAPTIVE WHO HAD ONCE DONE THE FAIRY A SERVICE ALL WAS SUBDUED AND QUIET AND LUCIE WAS MORE AT EASE THAN SHE HAD BEEN WHAT IS THAT SHE CRIED ALL AT ONCE MY DEAR

AND AS THE AFTERNOON SHADOWS DEEPENED THE OWNER OF THAT NAME HIMSELF APPEARED FROM OVERLOOKING A PAINTER WHOM DOCTOR MANETTE HAD EMPLOYED TO ADD TO THE LIST THE NAME OF CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY IN THE UNIVERSAL FEAR AND DISTRUST THAT DARKENED THE TIME
AT THE HEAD OF A SHOPKEEPER WITHOUT ANY INTRODUCTION IN THE NATURE OF AN ARTICLE AND IF IT HAPPENED NOT TO BE THE NAME OF THE THING SHE WANTED TO LOOK ROUND FOR THAT THING LAY HOLD OF IT AND HOLD ON BY IT UNTIL THE BARGAIN WAS CONCLUDED SHE ALWAYS MADE A BARGAIN FOR IT BY HOLDING UP

TO REMAIN AT THE HOTEL UNTIL HIS RETURN THAT AOUDA MIGHT NOT BE LEFT ENTIRELY ALONE MISTER FOGG REPAIRED TO THE EXCHANGE WHERE HE DID NOT DOUBT EVERY ONE
BEING RESERVED AS A FUND FOR HIS CHARITIES MISTER FOGG PLAYED NOT TO WIN BUT FOR THE SAKE OF PLAYING THE GAME WAS IN HIS EYES A CONTEST
ABOUT WITH FURY AND THE WAVES RUNNING HIGH THE RANGOON REEFED ALL HER SAILS
HIS ANXIETY TO FIX WHO THE SLY RASCAL TRIED TO CONSOLE HIM BY SAYING THAT MISTER FOGG
I'LL ANSWER FOR IT HE'LL NOT SLIP THROUGH MY FINGERS I HOPE SO MISTER FIX
A SORT OF TEMPEST AROSE ON THE THIRD OF NOVEMBER
BUT WITH NO PERCEPTIBLE EFFECT FOR NEITHER SHAKING NOR MALEDICTIONS COULD PREVAIL UPON IT TO CHANGE ITS MIND ON THE FOURTH HOWEVER THE SEA BECAME MORE CALM
WAS NO LONGER AT HONG KONG BUT PROBABLY IN HOLLAND
WHO ARRIVED AT SUEZ AND TO FOLLOW UP ALL WHO SEEMED TO BE SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS OR BORE A RESEMBLANCE TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CRIMINAL WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED TWO DAYS BEFORE FROM THE POLICE HEADQUARTERS AT LONDON
INSECTS PHILEAS FOGG WAS A MEMBER OF THE REFORM AND THAT WAS ALL THE WAY IN WHICH HE GOT ADMISSION TO THIS EXCLUSIVE CLUB WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH HE WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE BARINGS WITH WHOM HE HAD AN OPEN CREDIT
HE WOULD NATURALLY TAKE THE ROUTE VIA INDIA WHICH WAS LESS WATCHED AND MORE DIFFICULT TO WATCH THAN THAT OF THE ATLANTIC BUT FIX'S REFLECTIONS WERE SOON INTERRUPTED BY A SUCCESSION OF SHARP
THE STEAMER WAS FORCED TO PROCEED SLOWLY AND THE CAPTAIN ESTIMATED THAT SHE WOULD REACH HONG KONG
TWENTY NINE MINUTES AFTER ELEVEN A M THIS WEDNESDAY SECOND OCTOBER YOU ARE IN MY SERVICE PHILEAS FOGG GOT UP TOOK HIS HAT IN HIS LEFT HAND PUT IT ON HIS HEAD
OF THE CURIOUS WERE FAIRLY PUZZLED HAD HE TRAVELLED IT WAS LIKELY FOR NO ONE SEEMED TO KNOW THE WORLD MORE FAMILIARLY
ON THE RED SEA AS HE PASSED AMONG THE BUSY CROWD FIX ACCORDING TO HABIT SCRUTINISED
OR NEAR FRIENDS WHICH IS CERTAINLY MORE UNUSUAL HE LIVED ALONE IN HIS HOUSE
AND TOOK HIS MEALS CONSCIENTIOUSLY
AND UNHEARD OF TRAVELLERS POINTING OUT THE TRUE PROBABILITIES AND SEEMING AS IF

ALWAYS MAKING MORE THAN TEN KNOTS AN HOUR BETWEEN BRINDISI AND SUEZ AND NINE AND A HALF BETWEEN SUEZ AND BOMBAY TWO MEN
OF THE NEXT STEAMER MISTER FOGG WAS IT IS TRUE TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEHIND HIS TIME BUT THIS COULD NOT SERIOUSLY IMPERIL THE REMAINDER OF HIS TOUR THE STEAMER
HIS NAME WAS STRANGE TO THE SCIENTIFIC AND LEARNED SOCIETIES AND HE NEVER WAS KNOWN TO TAKE PART IN THE SAGE DELIBERATIONS OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTION
MAN'S CONFIDENCE HE FREQUENTLY OFFERED HIM A GLASS OF WHISKEY OR PALE ALE IN THE STEAMER BAR ROOM
AS THE PORT CLOCK STRUCK SHE CAN'T BE FAR OFF NOW RETURNED HIS COMPANION HOW LONG WILL SHE STOP AT SUEZ FOUR HOURS LONG ENOUGH TO GET IN HER COAL
THE PERSON OF THE DELIGHTFUL FIX ON SUNDAY OCTOBER TWENTIETH TOWARDS NOON THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE INDIAN COAST TWO HOURS LATER THE PILOT CAME ON BOARD
HE WAS PLEASED ON THE DAY AFTER LEAVING SUEZ TO FIND ON DECK
SEEING FROM HIS OFFICE WINDOW ENGLISH SHIPS DAILY PASSING TO AND FRO ON THE GREAT CANAL BY WHICH THE OLD ROUNDABOUT ROUTE FROM ENGLAND TO INDIA BY THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE WAS ABRIDGED
GREAT ROBBERS ALWAYS RESEMBLE HONEST FOLKS FELLOWS WHO HAVE RASCALLY FACES HAVE ONLY ONE COURSE TO TAKE AND THAT IS TO REMAIN HONEST OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE ARRESTED OFF HAND
SIGNALLED UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF THE SIXTH THE STEAMER WAS DUE ON THE FIFTH PHILEAS FOGG WAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS BEHIND HAND AND THE YOKOHAMA STEAMER WOULD OF COURSE BE MISSED
BETTER ACQUAINTANCE WITH HIM THAN THE REST DECLARED THAT NOBODY COULD
IN HIS DELIGHT EXCLAIMING PILOT YOU ARE THE BEST OF GOOD FELLOWS THE PILOT PROBABLY DOES NOT KNOW TO THIS DAY WHY HIS RESPONSES WON HIM THIS ENTHUSIASTIC GREETING
WITH AN AUTOMATIC MOTION AND WENT OFF WITHOUT A WORD
HE CAN SWIM CAN THIS MAN AND INSTANTLY HE STRIKES OUT
SOME HALF HOUR OF THIS WORK AND RIDERHOOD UNSHIPPED HIS SCULLS STOOD HOLDING ON TO A BARGE AND HAND OVER HAND LONG WISE ALONG THE BARGE'S SIDE GRADUALLY WORKED HIS BOAT UNDER HER HEAD INTO A SECRET LITTLE NOOK OF SCUMMY WATER

LAST EVENING HE DOES THIS WORSE FOR HIM HE DODGES ABOUT IN HIS BOAT DOES THIS MAN TILL HE GETS CHILLED HIS HANDS TAKING UP ONE OF THEM WHICH DROPPED LIKE A LEADEN WEIGHT GET NUMBED
AS THEY BUMPED HEAVILY AGAINST A PILE AND THEN IN A LOWER VOICE REVERSED HIS LATE APOSTROPHE BY REMARKING I WISH THE BOAT OF MY HONOURABLE AND GALLANT FRIEND MAY BE ENDOWED WITH PHILANTHROPY ENOUGH NOT TO TURN BOTTOM UPWARD AND EXTINGUISH US STEADY STEADY SIT CLOSE MORTIMER
BUT HE ALWAYS WAS A CHEAT CON FOUND HIM HE ALWAYS WAS A INFERNAL CHEAT WAS GAFFER NOTHING STRAIGHTFOR'ARD NOTHING ON THE SQUARE SO MEAN SO UNDERHANDED NEVER GOING THROUGH WITH A THING NOR CARRYING IT OUT LIKE A MAN HALLO STEADY
TWO NEW SERVANTS MISTER AND MISSUS BOFFIN SAT AFTER BREAKFAST IN THE BOWER A PREY TO PROSPERITY MISTER BOFFIN'S FACE DENOTED CARE AND COMPLICATION MANY DISORDERED PAPERS WERE BEFORE HIM
THAT HIS EYES WERE PROMINENT AND FIXED AND HIS BREATHING WAS STERTOROUS WHEN TO THE GREAT RELIEF OF MISSUS BOFFIN WHO OBSERVED THESE SYMPTOMS WITH ALARM THE YARD BELL RANG WHO'S THAT I WONDER SAID MISSUS BOFFIN
IF YOU ENTERED MY EMPLOYMENT WHAT WOULD YOU DO I WOULD KEEP EXACT ACCOUNTS OF ALL THE EXPENDITURE YOU SANCTIONED MISTER BOFFIN I WOULD WRITE YOUR LETTERS UNDER YOUR DIRECTION
HE LIKEWISE DROPPED INTO A VERY PRETTY PIECE OF POETRY TO BE SURE RESPECTING THE EXTENT TO WHICH HE WOULD BE WILLING TO PUT HIMSELF OUT OF THE WAY TO BRING MISSUS BOFFIN ROUND IN CASE SHE SHOULD EVER GET LOW IN HER SPIRITS IN THE HOUSE MISSUS BOFFIN HAS A WONDERFUL MEMORY WILL YOU REPEAT IT MY DEAR
I TELL YOU WHAT SAID MISTER BOFFIN SLOWLY CRUMPLING HIS OWN BLOTTED NOTE IN HIS HAND IF YOU'LL TURN TO AT THESE PRESENT PAPERS AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN MAKE OF EM I SHALL KNOW BETTER WHAT I CAN MAKE OF YOU NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE
YOU'LL DISFIGURE OR PULL ASUNDER PERHAPS I AM NOT GOING TO DO EITHER NOT EVEN TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER SAID MISTER INSPECTOR BUT I MEAN TO HAVE IT COME
THE WOODS FILTERED MEN AND THE FIELDS BECAME DOTTED AS HE ROUNDED A HILLOCK HE PERCEIVED THAT THE ROADWAY WAS NOW A CRYING MASS OF WAGONS TEAMS AND MEN
THE YOUTH CRIED OUT TO HIM HYSTERICALLY I LL TAKE CARE OF YEH JIM I LL TAKE CARE OF YEH I SWEAR T GAWD I WILL SURE WILL YEH HENRY THE TALL SOLDIER BESEECHED YES YES I TELL YEH I'LL TAKE CARE OF YEH JIM PROTESTED THE YOUTH
AS IF HE WERE TAKING INFINITE CARE NOT TO AROUSE THE PASSION OF HIS WOUNDS AS HE WENT ON HE SEEMED ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A PLACE LIKE ONE WHO GOES TO CHOOSE A GRAVE
AND THEIR ROBES OF GLORIOUS MEMORIES WERE SHAMS HOWEVER HE STILL SAID THAT IT WAS A GREAT PITY HE WAS NOT AS THEY A DEFEAT OF THE ARMY HAD SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM AS A MEANS OF ESCAPE
AND IN THE SAME WAY DHARMU'S WIFE MIGHT HAVE ACTED AS OVERSEER OF THE WOMEN BUT SHE WAS ASHAMED NOT TO WORK TOO ONE DAY THEY WERE TRANSPLANTING THE RICE AND KARMU BROUGHT OUT BREAKFAST FOR THE LABOURERS
BEGAN QUAVERINGLY TO QUESTION HIM WHERE YEH GOIN JIM WHAT YOU THINKING ABOUT WHERE YOU GOING TELL ME WON'T YOU JIM THE TALL SOLDIER FACED ABOUT AS UPON RELENTLESS PURSUERS
FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FALL HE CONSIDERED NOW HOWEVER THAT IT WAS USELESS TO THINK OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY
JIM JIM WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHAT MAKES YOU DO THIS WAY YOU'LL HURT YERSELF THE SAME PURPOSE WAS IN THE TALL SOLDIER'S FACE
THEY PAUSED AND STOOD EXPECTANT THERE WAS A SILENCE FINALLY THE CHEST OF THE DOOMED SOLDIER BEGAN TO HEAVE WITH A STRAINED MOTION
DUST STAINED HAGGARD PANTING FLYING TO THE FRONT AT THE PROPER MOMENT TO SEIZE AND THROTTLE THE DARK LEERING WITCH OF CALAMITY THEN THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE THING BEGAN TO DRAG AT HIM HE HESITATED
AND HE DID NOT CONCEIVE PUBLIC OPINION TO BE ACCURATE AT LONG RANGE IT WAS QUITE PROBABLE THEY WOULD HIT THE WRONG MAN WHO AFTER HE HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS AMAZEMENT WOULD PERHAPS SPEND THE REST OF HIS DAYS
HE DENOUNCED HIMSELF AS A VILLAIN HE SAID THAT HE WAS THE MOST UNUTTERABLY SELFISH MAN IN EXISTENCE HIS MIND PICTURED THE SOLDIERS WHO WOULD PLACE THEIR DEFIANT BODIES BEFORE THE SPEAR OF THE YELLING BATTLE FIEND
HE WAS QUICK TO SEE VULNERABLE PLACES IN THEM ALL FURTHERMORE HE WAS MUCH AFRAID THAT SOME ARROW OF SCORN MIGHT LAY HIM MENTALLY LOW BEFORE HE COULD RAISE HIS PROTECTING TALE
HE BELIEVED THAT HE ENVIED A CORPSE THINKING OF THE SLAIN HE ACHIEVED A GREAT CONTEMPT FOR SOME OF THEM AS IF THEY WERE GUILTY FOR THUS BECOMING LIFELESS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN KILLED BY LUCKY CHANCES HE SAID
IN THEIR PRESENCE HE COULD NOT PERSIST IN FLYING HIGH WITH THE WINGS OF WAR THEY RENDERED IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SEE HIMSELF IN A HEROIC LIGHT HE TUMBLED HEADLONG HE DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD A SCORCHING THIRST
HE PROTESTED IN A DULLED WAY KEEPING HIS EYES FASTENED ON THE MYSTIC PLACE OF HIS INTENTIONS NO NO DON'T TECH ME LEAVE ME BE LEAVE ME BE THE YOUTH AGHAST AND FILLED WITH WONDER AT THE TALL SOLDIER
AND THEY HAD NOTHING TO GIVE THEM IN THE NIGHT DHARMU'S WIFE SAID THEY PROMISED TO PAY US FOR MERELY LOOKING AFTER THE WORK AND INSTEAD WE WORKED HARD AND HAVE STILL GOT NOTHING WE WILL NOT WORK FOR THEM ANYMORE
THAT PREVIOUSLY THE ARMY HAD ENCOUNTERED GREAT DEFEATS AND IN A FEW MONTHS HAD SHAKEN OFF ALL BLOOD AND TRADITION OF THEM EMERGING AS BRIGHT AND VALIANT AS A NEW ONE THRUSTING OUT OF SIGHT THE MEMORY OF DISASTER
HE AND THE TATTERED MAN BEGAN A PURSUIT THERE WAS A SINGULAR RACE
STANDING BEFORE A CRIMSON AND STEEL ASSAULT GETTING CALMLY KILLED ON A HIGH PLACE BEFORE THE EYES OF ALL HE THOUGHT OF THE MAGNIFICENT PATHOS OF HIS DEAD BODY THESE THOUGHTS UPLIFTED HIM
THEN THEY MET A WOMAN WITH BOTH HER FEET BURNING IN A FIRE AND ANOTHER WITH A STOOL STUCK FAST TO HER BACK AND THEY PROMISED TO ENQUIRE HOW THESE MIGHT BE DELIVERED
THEY BEGAN TO HAVE THOUGHTS OF A SOLEMN CEREMONY THERE WAS SOMETHING RITE LIKE IN THESE MOVEMENTS OF THE DOOMED SOLDIER AND THERE WAS A RESEMBLANCE IN HIM TO A DEVOTEE OF A MAD RELIGION BLOOD SUCKING MUSCLE WRENCHING BONE CRUSHING
AS THE LATTER SLOWLY TURNED HIS WAXLIKE FEATURES TOWARD HIM THE YOUTH SCREAMED
AND AS HE SAW THEIR DRIPPING CORPSES ON AN IMAGINED FIELD HE SAID THAT HE WAS THEIR MURDERER AGAIN HE THOUGHT
AND MEN SLOWING TO HIS DREARY PACE WERE WALKING WITH HIM THEY WERE DISCUSSING HIS PLIGHT QUESTIONING HIM AND GIVING HIM ADVICE IN A DOGGED WAY HE REPELLED THEM
AND THE BUFFALO SAID GO ON TO THE BANK OF THE GANGES THEN THEY CAME TO A HORSE AND THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD CATCH IT AND MOUNT IT BUT IT KICKED AND SNORTED AND THEY SANG
I M FRAID I LL FALL DOWN AN THEM YEH KNOW THEM DAMNED ARTILLERY WAGONS
FROM THE HEAVING TANGLE ISSUED EXHORTATIONS COMMANDS IMPRECATIONS FEAR WAS SWEEPING IT ALL ALONG THE CRACKING WHIPS BIT AND HORSES PLUNGED AND TUGGED
PRESENTLY THE CALM HEAD OF A FORWARD GOING COLUMN OF INFANTRY APPEARED IN THE ROAD IT CAME SWIFTLY ON AVOIDING THE OBSTRUCTIONS GAVE IT THE SINUOUS MOVEMENT OF A SERPENT THE MEN AT THE HEAD
EATING AWAY WITH CAPTAIN FLINT UPON HIS SHOULDER HAD NOT A WORD OF BLAME FOR THEIR RECKLESSNESS AND THIS THE MORE SURPRISED ME FOR I THOUGHT HE HAD NEVER SHOWN HIMSELF SO CUNNING AS HE DID THEN
E S E AND BY E TEN FEET A TALL TREE WAS THUS THE PRINCIPAL MARK NOW RIGHT BEFORE US THE ANCHORAGE WAS BOUNDED BY A PLATEAU FROM TWO TO THREE HUNDRED FEET HIGH
YOU WOULDN'T LOOK TO FIND A BISHOP HERE I RECKON BUT WHAT SORT OF A WAY IS THAT FOR BONES TO LIE TAIN'T IN NATUR INDEED ON A SECOND GLANCE IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO FANCY THAT THE BODY WAS IN A NATURAL POSITION
IT ADVERTISED HIS CALLOWNESS A CALLOWNESS SHEER AND UNUTTERABLE BOTH MEN WERE MANIFESTLY OUT OF PLACE
BOUT SHIP MATES THIS HERE CREW IS ON A WRONG TACK I DO BELIEVE AND COME TO THINK ON IT IT WAS LIKE FLINT'S VOICE I GRANT YOU BUT
AND STRAGGLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO THE BEACH WHERE THE TWO GIGS AWAITED US EVEN THESE BORE TRACE OF THE DRUNKEN FOLLY OF THE PIRATES ONE IN A BROKEN THWART AND BOTH IN THEIR MUDDY AND UNBAILED CONDITION
SHE ATTACKED THE BELONGINGS OF HER MEN AND WENT THROUGH THEM LIKE A TORNADO THIS ACCOMPLISHED THE OUTFIT THOUGH CUT IN HALF WAS STILL A FORMIDABLE BULK CHARLES AND HAL WENT OUT IN THE EVENING AND BOUGHT SIX OUTSIDE DOGS
A HEAVY SCENTED BROOM AND MANY FLOWERING SHRUBS HAD ALMOST TAKEN THE PLACE OF GRASS THICKETS OF GREEN NUTMEG TREES WERE DOTTED HERE AND THERE WITH THE RED COLUMNS AND THE BROAD SHADOW OF THE PINES AND THE FIRST
HE WAS A SEAMAN SAID GEORGE MERRY WHO BOLDER THAN THE REST HAD GONE UP CLOSE AND WAS EXAMINING THE RAGS OF CLOTHING LEASTWAYS THIS IS GOOD SEA CLOTH AYE AYE SAID SILVER LIKE ENOUGH
AGAIN HAL'S WHIP FELL UPON THE DOGS THEY THREW THEMSELVES AGAINST THE BREAST BANDS DUG THEIR FEET INTO THE PACKED SNOW GOT DOWN LOW TO IT AND PUT FORTH ALL THEIR STRENGTH THE SLED HELD AS THOUGH IT WERE AN ANCHOR
DEARS SHE CRIED SYMPATHETICALLY WHY DON'T YOU PULL HARD THEN YOU WOULDN'T BE WHIPPED BUCK DID NOT LIKE HER BUT HE WAS FEELING TOO MISERABLE TO RESIST HER TAKING IT AS PART OF THE DAY'S MISERABLE WORK

MINGLED THEIR SPICE WITH THE AROMA OF THE OTHERS THE AIR BESIDES WAS FRESH AND STIRRING AND THIS UNDER THE SHEER SUNBEAMS WAS A WONDERFUL REFRESHMENT TO OUR SENSES
THEY'RE WEAK AS WATER IF YOU WANT TO KNOW CAME THE REPLY FROM ONE OF THE MEN PLUM TUCKERED OUT THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER THEY NEED A REST REST BE BLANKED SAID HAL WITH HIS BEARDLESS LIPS
WHEN ONCE MORE MERCEDES INTERFERED SHE DROPPED ON HER KNEES BEFORE BUCK WITH TEARS IN HER EYES AND PUT HER ARMS AROUND HIS NECK
THE FIRST OF THE TALL TREES WAS REACHED AND BY THE BEARINGS PROVED THE WRONG ONE SO WITH THE SECOND THE THIRD ROSE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FEET INTO THE AIR ABOVE A CLUMP OF UNDERWOOD A GIANT OF A VEGETABLE WITH A RED COLUMN AS BIG AS A COTTAGE
THE TREASURE HUNT FLINT'S POINTER JIM SAID SILVER WHEN WE WERE ALONE IF I SAVED YOUR LIFE YOU SAVED MINE AND I'LL NOT FORGET IT I SEEN THE DOCTOR WAVING YOU TO RUN FOR IT WITH THE TAIL OF MY EYE I DID
DICK HAD HIS BIBLE OUT AND WAS PRAYING VOLUBLY HE HAD BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP HAD DICK BEFORE HE CAME TO SEA AND FELL AMONG BAD COMPANIONS STILL SILVER WAS UNCONQUERED I COULD HEAR HIS TEETH RATTLE IN HIS HEAD
SHE WAS CHARLES'S WIFE AND HAL'S SISTER A NICE FAMILY PARTY BUCK WATCHED THEM APPREHENSIVELY AS THEY PROCEEDED TO TAKE DOWN THE TENT AND LOAD THE SLED THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT ABOUT THEIR MANNER BUT NO BUSINESSLIKE METHOD
IN HIS LIFETIME OF DECEIT HAD OFTEN SUCCESSFULLY FEIGNED A HURT LEG WAS NOW LIMPING IN EARNEST SOL LEKS WAS LIMPING AND DUB WAS SUFFERING FROM A WRENCHED SHOULDER BLADE THEY WERE ALL TERRIBLY FOOTSORE
BUT IT'S OVER AND DONE I'LL TAKE HIM IN A LINE WHEN WE GO TREASURE HUNTING FOR WE'LL KEEP HIM LIKE SO MUCH GOLD IN CASE OF ACCIDENTS YOU MARK AND IN THE MEANTIME ONCE WE GOT THE SHIP AND TREASURE BOTH
AT THE FOOT OF A PRETTY BIG PINE AND INVOLVED IN A GREEN CREEPER WHICH HAD EVEN PARTLY LIFTED SOME OF THE SMALLER BONES A HUMAN SKELETON LAY WITH A FEW SHREDS OF CLOTHING ON THE GROUND I BELIEVE A CHILL STRUCK FOR A MOMENT TO EVERY HEART
I SAW HIM DEAD WITH THESE HERE DEADLIGHTS SAID MORGAN BILLY TOOK ME IN THERE HE LAID WITH
BUT IF EVER SPERRIT WALKED IT WOULD BE FLINT'S DEAR HEART BUT HE DIED BAD DID FLINT AYE THAT HE DID OBSERVED ANOTHER NOW HE RAGED AND NOW HE HOLLERED FOR THE RUM
HAD BEEN THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DULY ACCOMPLISHED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE GRAVES OF THE DEAD THE DELIANS HAD ATRAMYTTIUM IN ASIA GIVEN THEM BY PHARNACES AND SETTLED THERE AS THEY REMOVED FROM DELOS MEANWHILE
HE RECEIVED A WOUND BUT HIS FALL WAS NOT PERCEIVED BY THE ATHENIANS
IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONG AND THAT IF WE DO NOT MOLEST THEM IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID SO THAT BESIDES EXTENDING OUR EMPIRE WE SHOULD GAIN IN SECURITY BY YOUR SUBJECTION
UNLESS THE TERMS BE EQUAL BUT WE TRUST THAT THE GODS MAY GRANT US FORTUNE AS GOOD AS YOURS SINCE WE ARE JUST MEN FIGHTING AGAINST UNJUST
AND OTHER SUCH INVENTIONS THAT DELUDE MEN WITH HOPES TO THEIR DESTRUCTION MELIANS
WHICH HE HAD BEEN PUT TO TO TO ARM THEM HE THOUGHT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE LESS CHANCE OF BEATING HIM THAN BY NOT LETTING HIM HAVE A SIGHT OF THEM AND THUS LEARN HOW GOOD A RIGHT HE HAD TO DESPISE THEM
AND SUBJECTS SMARTING UNDER THE YOKE WHO WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY TO TAKE A RASH STEP AND LEAD THEMSELVES AND US INTO OBVIOUS DANGER MELIANS WELL THEN
HE NOW SENT ENVOYS TO PERDICCAS TO COMMAND HIS ATTENDANCE WITH AN ARMY AS PROVIDED BY THE ALLIANCE AND OTHERS TO THRACE
WHILE THE STRONG DO WHAT THEY CAN AND THE WEAK SUFFER WHAT THEY MUST MELIANS AS WE THINK AT ANY RATE IT IS EXPEDIENT
IN ORDER THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK STRAIGHT ON WITHOUT INTERRUPTION AND DECEIVE THE EARS OF THE MULTITUDE BY SEDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS WHICH WOULD PASS WITHOUT REFUTATION FOR WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE MEANING OF OUR BEING BROUGHT BEFORE THE FEW
PELOPONNESIANS THE CHARACTER OF THE COUNTRY FROM WHICH WE HAVE COME ONE WHICH HAS ALWAYS OWED ITS FREEDOM TO VALOUR AND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE DORIANS AND THE ENEMY YOU ARE ABOUT TO FIGHT IONIANS WHOM YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BEAT
AND THEY REFUSED TO RENEW IT
PROCEEDED ON HIS VOYAGE AND AT LENGTH ARRIVED AT ATHENS CLEON
WHOM THEY CAME TO REINFORCE WAS DEAD THEY TURNED BACK HOME THINKING THAT THE MOMENT HAD GONE BY THE ATHENIANS BEING DEFEATED AND GONE AND THEMSELVES NOT EQUAL TO THE EXECUTION OF BRASIDAS'S DESIGNS
WITH TWELVE HUNDRED HEAVY INFANTRY AND THREE HUNDRED HORSE FROM ATHENS
MEANWHILE HE HAD BEEN SEEN COMING DOWN FROM CERDYLIUM AND THEN IN THE CITY WHICH IS OVERLOOKED FROM THE OUTSIDE SACRIFICING NEAR THE TEMPLE OF ATHENE IN SHORT ALL HIS MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN OBSERVED
THAT THERE IS NO SECURITY IN THE POLICY WHICH WE INDICATE FOR HERE AGAIN IF YOU DEBAR US FROM TALKING ABOUT JUSTICE AND INVITE US TO OBEY YOUR INTEREST WE ALSO MUST EXPLAIN OURS
WHICH WAS INDEED THE ONLY WAY PRACTICABLE THIS HOWEVER NOT BEING QUICK ENOUGH FOR HIM HE JOINED THE RETREAT IN PERSON AND MADE THE RIGHT WING WHEEL ROUND THUS TURNING ITS UNARMED SIDE TO THE ENEMY
AND DO YOU ALLIES FOLLOW HIM LIKE MEN AND REMEMBER THAT ZEAL HONOUR AND OBEDIENCE MARK THE GOOD SOLDIER
ENCAMPING IN THEIR TERRITORY WITH THE ABOVE ARMAMENT BEFORE DOING ANY HARM TO THEIR LAND SENT ENVOYS TO NEGOTIATE THESE THE MELIANS DID NOT BRING BEFORE THE PEOPLE
A QUARTER OF THE TOWN OF LEONTINI AND BRICINNIAE A STRONG PLACE IN THE LEONTINE COUNTRY AND BEING THERE JOINED BY MOST OF THE EXILED COMMONS CARRIED ON WAR FROM THE FORTIFICATIONS
WHILE THE ATHENIANS TOOK MEASURES TO KEEP BETTER GUARD IN FUTURE SUMMER WAS NOW OVER
AND HELPING THEIR ENEMIES ATHENIANS THEN YOU DO NOT ADOPT THE VIEW THAT EXPEDIENCY GOES WITH SECURITY WHILE JUSTICE AND HONOUR CANNOT BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT DANGER
ONE BY THE HARBOUR THE OTHER BY THE FORTIFICATION AND MAKING SLAVES OF THE WIVES AND CHILDREN OF THE TORONAEANS SENT THE MEN WITH THE PELOPONNESIANS AND ANY CHALCIDIANS THAT WERE THERE TO THE NUMBER OF SEVEN HUNDRED TO ATHENS
MAY NOT DAMP YOUR COURAGE BY THE APPARENT DISADVANTAGE AT WHICH IT PLACES YOU I IMAGINE IT IS THE POOR OPINION THAT HE HAS OF US AND THE FACT THAT HE HAS NO IDEA OF ANY ONE COMING OUT TO ENGAGE HIM
HE DID NOT VENTURE TO GO OUT IN REGULAR ORDER AGAINST THE ATHENIANS HE MISTRUSTED HIS STRENGTH AND THOUGHT IT INADEQUATE TO THE ATTEMPT NOT IN NUMBERS THESE WERE NOT SO UNEQUAL BUT IN QUALITY
REMAINED TO ARRANGE MATTERS AT AMPHIPOLIS
SO WILL YOU BE MOST COMPLETELY DECEIVED THE ATHENIAN ENVOYS NOW RETURNED TO THE ARMY AND THE MELIANS SHOWING NO SIGNS OF YIELDING
THAN WHEN IT COMES AS THE RESULT OF MISFORTUNE THIS IF YOU ARE WELL ADVISED YOU WILL GUARD AGAINST AND YOU WILL NOT THINK IT DISHONOURABLE TO SUBMIT TO THE GREATEST CITY IN HELLAS
THINKING THAT HE SHOULD NOT HAVE AGAIN SUCH A CHANCE OF CATCHING THEM ALONE IF THEIR REINFORCEMENTS WERE ONCE ALLOWED TO COME UP AND SO CALLING ALL HIS SOLDIERS TOGETHER IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THEM AND EXPLAIN HIS INTENTION SPOKE AS FOLLOWS
WHILE THEIR SPIRIT IS SLACK AND NOT HIGH STRUNG WITH EXPECTATION I WITH THE MEN UNDER MY COMMAND WILL IF POSSIBLE TAKE THEM BY SURPRISE AND FALL WITH A RUN UPON THEIR CENTRE
BUT WE KNOW THAT THE FORTUNE OF WAR IS SOMETIMES MORE IMPARTIAL THAN THE DISPROPORTION OF NUMBERS MIGHT LEAD ONE TO SUPPOSE TO SUBMIT IS TO GIVE OURSELVES OVER TO DESPAIR
BRING IT ABOUT AS WELL AS YOU CAN AND GET YOU GONE YOU LITTLE OLD MAN YOU COULD SQUEEZE IN THROUGH THAT LITTLE ROUND HOLE SAID GOODY TIPTOES YES I COULD SAID THE CHIPMUNK BUT MY HUSBAND
AND SO IT WENT ON FOR A FORT NIGHT TILL A BIG WIND BLEW OFF THE TOP OF THE TREE AND OPENED UP THE HOLE AND LET IN THE RAIN THEN TIMMY TIPTOES CAME OUT AND WENT HOME WITH AN UMBRELLA BUT CHIPPY HACKEE CONTINUED
SAID MISSUS GOODY TIPTOES BUT WHERE IS CHIPPY HACKEE MY HUSBAND TIMMY TIPTOES HAS RUN AWAY TOO
AND THEN TURNED TAIL AND FLED TOWARDS HIS NEST FOLLOWED BY A CROWD OF SQUIRRELS SHOUTING WHO'S BEEN DIGGING UP MY NUTS THEY CAUGHT HIM
AND THEN HE DUG AGAIN AND FOUND SOME NUTS THAT DID NOT BELONG TO HIM AND THERE WAS A FIGHT AND OTHER SQUIRRELS BEGAN TO DIG THE WHOLE WOOD WAS IN COMMOTION UNFORTUNATELY
SHE DID NOT PUT ANY MORE NUTS INTO THE WOODPECKER'S HOLE BECAUSE SHE HAD ALWAYS DOUBTED HOW THEY COULD BE GOT OUT AGAIN SHE HID THEM UNDER A TREE ROOT THEY RATTLED DOWN DOWN DOWN
AND TIMMY REPLIED IS THAT YOU GOODY TIPTOES WHY CERTAINLY HE CAME UP AND KISSED GOODY THROUGH THE HOLE BUT HE WAS SO FAT THAT HE COULD NOT GET OUT CHIPPY HACKEE WAS NOT TOO FAT BUT HE DID NOT WANT TO COME
THERE WAS A LITTLE FAT COMFORTABLE GREY SQUIRREL CALLED TIMMY TIPTOES HE HAD A NEST THATCHED WITH LEAVES IN THE TOP OF A TALL TREE AND
THE SQUIRRELS FOLLOWED AND LISTENED THE FIRST LITTLE BIRD FLEW INTO THE BUSH WHERE TIMMY AND GOODY TIPTOES WERE QUIETLY TYING UP THEIR BAGS
THE CHIPMUNK EXPLAINED THAT IT HAD RAINED NUTS THROUGH THE TOP OF THE TREE BESIDES I FOUND A FEW BURIED IT LAUGHED AND CHUCKLED WHEN IT HEARD TIMMY'S STORY
WHERE THERE WAS THE LITTLE ROUND HOLE AND THEY PUSHED HIM IN THE HOLE WAS MUCH TOO SMALL FOR TIMMY TIPTOES FIGURE THEY SQUEEZED HIM DREADFULLY IT WAS A WONDER THEY DID NOT BREAK HIS RIBS
THEY CARRIED THEM AWAY IN BAGS AND STORED THEM IN SEVERAL HOLLOW STUMPS NEAR THE TREE WHERE THEY HAD BUILT THEIR NEST WHEN THESE STUMPS WERE FULL THEY BEGAN TO EMPTY THE BAGS INTO A HOLE HIGH UP A TREE
WE WILL LEAVE HIM HERE TILL HE CONFESSES SAID SILVERTAIL SQUIRREL AND HE SHOUTED INTO THE HOLE WHO'S BEEN DIGGING UP MY NUTS TIMMY TIPTOES MADE NO REPLY HE HAD TUMBLED DOWN INSIDE THE TREE
TIMMY TIPTOES WENT ON WITH HIS WORK WITHOUT REPLYING INDEED THE LITTLE BIRD DID NOT EXPECT AN ANSWER IT WAS ONLY SINGING ITS NATURAL SONG AND IT MEANT NOTHING AT ALL BUT WHEN THE OTHER SQUIRRELS HEARD THAT SONG
THEY RUSHED UPON TIMMY TIPTOES AND CUFFED AND SCRATCHED HIM AND UPSET HIS BAG OF NUTS THE INNOCENT LITTLE BIRD WHICH HAD CAUSED ALL THE MISCHIEF FLEW AWAY IN A FRIGHT TIMMY ROLLED OVER AND OVER
AND WHEN CHIPPY HACKEE GOT HOME HE FOUND HE HAD CAUGHT A COLD IN HIS HEAD AND HE WAS MORE UNCOMFORTABLE STILL AND NOW TIMMY AND GOODY TIPTOES KEEP THEIR NUT STORE FASTENED UP WITH A LITTLE PADLOCK
THERE WAS A CHIRPY NOISE AND A SMALL STRIPED CHIPMUNK APPEARED WITH A NIGHT LIGHT AND HOPED HE FELT BETTER IT WAS MOST KIND TO TIMMY TIPTOES IT LENT HIM ITS NIGHTCAP AND THE HOUSE WAS FULL OF PROVISIONS
TO CAMP OUT FOR ANOTHER WEEK ALTHOUGH IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AT LAST A LARGE BEAR CAME WALKING THROUGH THE WOOD PERHAPS HE ALSO WAS LOOKING FOR NUTS HE SEEMED TO BE SNIFFING AROUND CHIPPY HACKEE WENT HOME IN A HURRY
LOSE MORE THAN HALF BECAUSE THEY CANNOT REMEMBER THE PLACE THE MOST FORGETFUL SQUIRREL IN THE WOOD WAS CALLED SILVERTAIL HE BEGAN TO DIG AND HE COULD NOT REMEMBER
THE TALE OF TIMMY TIPTOES
JUST AT THIS TIME A FLOCK OF LITTLE BIRDS FLEW BY FROM BUSH TO BUSH SEARCHING FOR GREEN CATERPILLARS AND SPIDERS THERE WERE SEVERAL SORTS OF LITTLE BIRDS TWITTERING DIFFERENT SONGS
DOWN BELOW THERE WAS A NOISE OF NUTCRACKERS AND A FAT SQUIRREL VOICE AND A THIN SQUIRREL VOICE WERE SINGING TOGETHER MY LITTLE OLD MAN AND I FELL OUT HOW SHALL WE BRING THIS MATTER ABOUT
HE HAD A LITTLE SQUIRREL WIFE CALLED GOODY TIMMY TIPTOES SAT OUT ENJOYING THE BREEZE HE WHISKED HIS TAIL AND CHUCKLED LITTLE WIFE GOODY THE NUTS ARE RIPE
HE FOUND HIMSELF TUCKED UP IN A LITTLE MOSS BED VERY MUCH IN THE DARK FEELING SORE IT SEEMED TO BE UNDER GROUND TIMMY COUGHED AND GROANED BECAUSE HIS RIBS HURTED HIM
THE SITTING ROOM IS FULL AND THEY ARE ROLLING ALONG THE PASSAGE AND MY HUSBAND CHIPPY HACKEE HAS RUN AWAY AND LEFT ME WHAT IS THE EXPLANATION OF THESE SHOWERS OF NUTS I AM SURE I BEG YOUR PARDON I DID NOT KNOW THAT ANYBODY LIVED HERE
GOODY TIPTOES PASSED A LONELY AND UNHAPPY NIGHT NEXT MORNING SHE VENTURED BACK TO THE NUT BUSHES TO LOOK FOR HIM BUT THE OTHER UNKIND SQUIRRELS DROVE HER AWAY
TIMMY TOOK OFF HIS JACKET AND HUNG IT ON A TWIG THEY WORKED AWAY QUIETLY BY THEMSELVES EVERY DAY THEY MADE SEVERAL JOURNEYS
MY WIFE WILL BE ANXIOUS JUST ANOTHER NUT OR TWO NUTS LET ME CRACK THEM FOR YOU SAID THE CHIPMUNK TIMMY TIPTOES GREW FATTER AND FATTER NOW GOODY TIPTOES HAD SET TO WORK AGAIN BY HERSELF
MOREOVER MISTER GREGORY DEPOSED THE ERRANT ONE SEEN SLIDING OUT OF THE SWINGING DOOR AND SUMMONED IN A LOUD CLEAR VOICE TO COME BACK HAD FLATLY DISOBEYED
AND THAT IN ORDER NOT TO LOSE HIS HEAD AND DO FOOLISH THINGS HE MUST NOT ACT ON HIS OWN IDEAS TONIGHT BUT MUST YIELD HIMSELF UP ENTIRELY TO THE WILL OF THOSE WHO WERE GUIDING HIM
NOT TWO MINUTES HAD PASSED BEFORE PRINCE VASILI WITH HEAD ERECT MAJESTICALLY ENTERED THE ROOM
ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA'S FACE EXPRESSED A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE DECISIVE MOMENT HAD ARRIVED WITH THE AIR OF A PRACTICAL PETERSBURG LADY SHE NOW
BUT I THINK WE MAY SAY THAT WE ARE WELL OUT OF THE PLACE MIKE'S MIND ROAMED INTO THE FUTURE
OF THE SAME KIND HIDING IN THE SHADOW OF THE HOUSE ON BOTH SIDES
PSMITH DID NOT REPLY WITH A BENEVOLENT SMILE AND A GESTURE INTENDED TO SIGNIFY ALL WOULD COME RIGHT IN THE FUTURE HE SLID THROUGH THE SWING DOORS
THE DYING MAN WISHED TO SEE HER OWN ADMISSION WAS ASSURED CASTING A RAPID GLANCE AT ALL THOSE IN THE ROOM AND NOTICING THE COUNT'S CONFESSOR THERE SHE GLIDED UP TO HIM WITH A SORT OF AMBLE
PROCLAIMING THE PERFECT WAY THEN THE PRIEST OPENING HIS EYES IN A GREAT RADIANCE PERCEIVED THAT ALL THINGS HAD BEEN CHANGED THE PLACE WAS INDEED THE VULTURE PEAK
AND ONLY THEN BEGAN TO THINK OF THE INTERVIEW WITH HIS DYING FATHER WHICH AWAITED HIM HE NOTICED THAT THEY HAD NOT COME TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE BUT TO THE BACK DOOR
IT HAD TO BE HOWEVER THE BANK WAS NO PLACE FOR US AN EXCELLENT CAREER IN MANY RESPECTS BUT UNSUITABLE FOR YOU AND ME IT IS HARD ON COMRADE BICKERSDYKE ESPECIALLY AS HE TOOK SUCH TROUBLE TO GET ME INTO IT
ENGAGED WITH A CIGAR AND A CUP OF COFFEE IN THE LOWER SMOKING ROOM OF THE SENIOR CONSERVATIVE CLUB PSMITH AND MIKE ENTERED THE ROOM WHEN HE WAS ABOUT HALF THROUGH THESE LUXURIES PSMITH'S FIRST ACTION WAS TO SUMMON A WAITER
WERE SITTING CLOSE TOGETHER TALKING SEEING THEM PASS
OUR RESOLVE AND RETURN TO THE BANK IS UNWORTHY OF YOU BE A MAN BITE THE BULLET THE FIRST KEEN PANG WILL PASS TIME WILL SOFTEN THE FEELING OF BEREAVEMENT YOU MUST BE BRAVE
ADDRESSING A MAID WHO WAS HURRYING PAST WITH A DECANTER ON A TRAY AS MY DEAR AND MY SWEET ASKED ABOUT THE PRINCESS HEALTH AND THEN LED PIERRE ALONG A STONE PASSAGE
IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SUMPTUOUS BUT COLD APARTMENTS KNOWN TO PIERRE ONLY FROM THE FRONT APPROACH BUT EVEN IN THIS ROOM THERE NOW STOOD AN EMPTY BATH AND WATER HAD BEEN SPILLED ON THE CARPET
WHERE'S A CAB HI CABBY NO THAT ONE'S GOT SOME ONE IN IT THERE'S ANOTHER HI HERE LUNATIC ARE YOU BLIND GOOD HE'S SEEN US
BUT WHAT OF THAT HE MUSED THOUGHTFULLY SMOOTHING HIS HAT WITH HIS KNUCKLES COMRADE GREGORY IS A MAN WHO TAKES SUCH AN ENTHUSIASTIC PLEASURE IN HIS DUTIES
AT ANY MOMENT MISTER GREGORY'S HOARSE ROAR MIGHT SHATTER THE COMPARATIVE STILLNESS OR THE SINISTER NOTE OF MISTER BICKERSDYKE MAKE ITSELF HEARD
REASON SUGGESTED THAT THERE WERE PROBABLY ONE OR TWO KNOCKING ABOUT SOMEWHERE BUT THIS WAS NO TIME TO THINK OF THEM HE EXAMINED THE FUTURE AND FOUND IT GOOD
AND THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH MANDARAVA AND MANJUSHAKA FLOWERS SHOWERED FROM HEAVEN AND THE NIGHT WAS FILLED WITH FRAGRANCE AND SPLENDOUR AND THE SWEETNESS OF THE GREAT VOICE AND IN MID AIR
ASKED ANNA MIKHAYLOVNA OF ONE OF THEM YES REPLIED A FOOTMAN IN A BOLD LOUD VOICE AS IF ANYTHING WERE NOW PERMISSIBLE THE DOOR TO THE LEFT MA'AM
IN ANY CASE IT IS SAFEST TO HAVE A PICK ME UP HANDY HE PAID THE WAITER AND ADVANCED ACROSS THE ROOM FOLLOWED BY MIKE IN HIS HAND EXTENDED AT ARM'S LENGTH
SHE HURRIEDLY ASCENDED THE NARROW DIMLY LIT STONE STAIRCASE CALLING TO PIERRE WHO WAS LAGGING BEHIND TO FOLLOW THOUGH
SAID PSMITH PERHAPS YOU ARE WISE IN A WORD THEN HE PICKED UP THE BRANDY AND HELD IT OUT TO HIM
HE WENT ON AS IF HE WERE ADVISING A FRIEND ON SOME COURSE OF ACTION
REALLY I CANNOT REMEMBER TO HAVE EVER SEEN YOU BEFORE PLEASE TELL ME WHO YOU ARE IT IS NOT WONDERFUL THAT YOU CANNOT RECOGNIZE ME IN THIS FORM RETURNED THE MONK
MISTER GREGORY WAS LEANING OVER THE BARRIER WHICH DIVIDED HIS LAIR FROM THE OUTER WORLD AND GESTICULATING VIOLENTLY WHERE ARE YOU GOING ROARED THE HEAD OF THE FIXED DEPOSITS
MISTER SMITH HESITATED FOR A MOMENT THEN MADE UP HIS MIND VERY WELL HE SAID I REALLY THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA THERE ARE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES OPEN TO A BARRISTER I WISH WE HAD THOUGHT OF IT BEFORE I AM
LIKE A DASHED APE A MOST UNJUST DESCRIPTION OF THE SAD SWEET SMILE WHICH PSMITH HAD BESTOWED UPON HIM FROM THE DOORWAY
WITH THEIR COUNTLESS FOLLOWING GODS DEMONS NAGAS GOBLINS MEN AND BEINGS NOT HUMAN SARIPUTRA HE SAW AND KASYAPA AND ANANDA
THAT HER JUNIOR CLASSES WERE THE MOST TRYING OF THE DAY BECAUSE SHE HAD TO WORK HARDER TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE THAN TO TEACH HER SUBJECT THAT'S A NICE REPUTATION TO CARRY AROUND ISN'T IT REMARKED NORA INDIGNANTLY BUT ALL WE CAN DO IS TO TRY HARDER THAN EVER TO MAKE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY
THAT AS IT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT YOUR TAKING A LITTLE ROW AND THEN EACH CAN JUDGE OF THE OTHER'S CLAIM TO SUPERIORITY MY CLAIM HAS NEVER BEEN JUSTLY ESTABLISHED SAID RUTH I HAVE NEVER ALLOWED ANY ONE TO USURP MY OARS
AND SO CHARMINGLY DID SHE DEPICT BOTH CHARACTERS THAT WHEN SHE ENDED WITH ORLANDO'S EXIT SHE RECEIVED A LITTLE OVATION FROM THE LISTENING GIRLS IN WHICH MISTER SOUTHARD AND MISS TEBBS JOINED
I SHALL TRY AWFULLY HARD FOR A PART EVEN IF IT IS ONLY TWO LINES SAID ANNE EARNESTLY I WONDER WHAT PLAY IS TO BE CHOSEN AND IF IT IS TO BE GIVEN FOR THE SCHOOL ONLY
READ THIS HE SAID BRIEFLY HOLDING OUT THE BOOK TO NORA NORA BEGAN AND READ GLIBLY ON UNCONSCIOUSLY EMPHASIZING AS SHE DID SO DOWN ONE PAGE SHE READ AND HALF WAY THROUGH THE NEXT BEFORE MISTER SOUTHARD SEEMED SATISFIED
IT IS WONDERFUL TO FEEL THAT ONE IS ABLE TO FORGET ONE'S SELF AND BECOME SOME ONE ELSE BUT IT IS MORE WONDERFUL TO MAKE ONE'S AUDIENCE FEEL IT TOO TO HAVE THEM FORGET THAT ONE IS ANYTHING EXCEPT THE LIVING BREATHING PERSON WHOSE CHARACTER ONE IS TRYING TO PORTRAY
PROBABLY THE DISPLAY AMUSED HIM WHAT WAS SHE TO HIM ANYWAY BUT A GIRL WITH WHOM HE COULD FLIRT IN HIS IDLE MOMENTS WELL WITH A PASSIONATE FLING OF HER ARMS SHE WOULD EXTINGUISH HER UNCONTROLLABLE LITTLE BEATER FOR THE NONCE
THIS IS A VERITABLE LAND OF MILK AND HONEY COME UP AND LISTEN TO MY WIFE RHAPSODIZE HOW IS SHE HE ASKED TURNING WITH HIM AND CATCHING A GLIMPSE OF RUTH'S VANISHING FIGURE
THEY EXPECTED HER TO LIVE UP TO HER REPUTATION AND SHE HAD SCARCELY DELIVERED THE OPENING LINE BEFORE THEY REALIZED THAT SHE WOULD NOT DISAPPOINT THEM HER MUSICAL VOICE VIBRATED WITH EXPRESSION
MIRIAM NESBIT WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE DUKE WHILE MARIAN BARBER WAS TO PLAY FREDERICK HIS BROTHER JESSICA WAS IN RAPTURES OVER PHEBE WHILE NORA HAD CAPTURED TOUCHSTONE EVA ALLEN AUDREY AND TO HER GREAT DELIGHT
TILL UNDER HIS WORSHIPPING EYES HER OWN FILLED WITH SLOW ECSTATIC TEARS DOCTOR CALLED A STARTLED VOICE ROW OUT I AM RIGHT UNDER THE TREES THEY BOTH STARTED
YOU HAD BETTER SIT DOWN HE SAID MOTIONING TO THE ROWER'S SEAT AND YOU SHE ASKED I SHALL SIT BESIDE YOU AND USE THE OTHER OAR HE ANSWERED NONCHALANTLY SMILING DOWN AT HER WITH A HALF PLEASED FEELING OF DISCOMFITURE
STANDING MOTIONLESS BESIDE THE BOAT YOUR PLACE AH YES NOW HE SAID HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO HER WILL YOU STEP IN SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND STEPPED IN THEY WERE BOTH STANDING AND AS THE LITTLE BARK SWAYED HE MADE A MOVEMENT TO CATCH HOLD OF HER
GRACE'S HEART WAS WITH HER CLASS SHE WISHED IT TO BE A CLASS AMONG CLASSES AND FELT AN ALMOST MOTHERLY ANXIETY FOR ITS SUCCESS WHAT DOES AIL SOME OF OUR CLASS SHE EXCLAIMED TO ANNE AND NORA ONE DAY AS THEY LEFT THE SCHOOL BUILDING
IN THE BOW I DISLIKE TO SEE DANGERS BEFORE WE COME TO THEM HE HELPED HER CAREFULLY TO HER PLACE SHE THANKED HIM LAUGHINGLY FOR HIS EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG ARM AND HE TURNED TO RUTH I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO MOVE FROM MY PLACE SHE SAID IN DEFIANT MISCHIEF
FROM THE DAY THAT MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN HER TO TASK FOR ABSENCE SHE HAD ENTERTAINED A SUPREME CONTEMPT FOR THE PRINCIPAL OF WHICH MISS THOMPSON WAS WHOLLY UNAWARE UNTIL ENCOUNTERING ELEANOR ONE MORNING IN THE CORRIDOR
I WANTED HER TO PLAY ROSALIND AND I KNEW SHE COULD DO IT LOOK GIRLS MISTER SOUTHARD IS SHAKING HANDS WITH HER TRUE ENOUGH ANNE WAS SHYLY SHAKING HANDS WITH THE GREAT ACTOR WHO WAS CONGRATULATING HER WARMLY UPON HER RECENT EFFORT
AND THE SLIGHT WHITE FIGURE STOOD STILL TILL THEY CAME UP YOU ARE SO SLOW SHE SAID WITH A RECKLESS LITTLE LAUGH I FEEL AS IF I COULD FLY HOME ARE YOU LIGHT HEADED RUTH ASKED HER MOTHER BUT THE GIRL HAD FALLEN BEHIND THEM
I SUPPOSE WE SHALL ALL BE THROUGH DINNER BY HALF PAST TWO YOU HAD BETTER BRING YOUR GIRLS TO MY HOUSE EACH OF YOU IS TO HAVE TWO AND JESSICA HAS ONE BESIDES MABEL I AM TO HAVE THREE I FOUND ANOTHER YESTERDAY DAVID PROMISED TO GET ME THE TICKETS
WITH NUMEROUS ADDITIONS FAR FROM PLEASING TO HER SHE WAS THOROUGHLY ANGRY AND AT ONCE LAID THE MATTER AT GRACE'S DOOR WHILE HER ANIMOSITY TOWARD GRACE GREW DAILY BUT GRACE WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT ELEANOR DISLIKED
WE FIND IT SAVES BOTH TIME AND SPLEEN SHE HELD THEM LIGHTLY IN PLACE ON HER SHOULDER ALLOW ME HE SAID PLACING HIS HAND UPON THE OARS A SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION TOOK POSSESSION OF HER
THE SORORITY THAT ELEANOR HAD MENTIONED IN HER LETTER TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU WAS NOW IN FULL FLOWER THE SEVEN GIRLS WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE OMNIBUS HOUSE WERE THE CHOSEN MEMBERS THEY WORE PINS IN THE SHAPE OF SKULLS AND CROSS BONES
SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO NOTICE THE EASY MOTION OF HIS FIGURE AS HE ROWED LIGHTLY DOWN THE RIVER HIS FLANNEL SHIRT LOW AT THE THROAT SHOWED HIS STRONG WHITE NECK RISING LIKE A COLUMN FROM HIS BROAD SHOULDERS
SHE COULD NOT YET MEET HIS EYES AGAIN COME RUTH EITHER STAY WITH US OR JUST AHEAD OF US
THE PLAY HASN'T BEEN DECIDED UPON YET REPLIED GRACE BUT THE OBJECT OF IT IS TO GET SOME MONEY FOR NEW BOOKS FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARY THE PLAN IS TO CHARGE FIFTY CENTS A PIECE FOR THE TICKETS AND TO GIVE EACH GIRL A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THEM TO SELL
AND WERE ENJOYING THE BEAUTY OF THE NIGHT WHEN WILL TYRRELL PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THEM GOOD EVENING HE SAID TAKING OFF HIS HAT AS HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS
BY THE WAY GIRLS DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE OF ANY USE TO INVITE ELEANOR ELEANOR EXCLAIMED NORA AFTER WHAT SHE HAS SAID TO YOU YOU MIGHT AS WELL THROW YOUR INVITATION INTO THE FIRE FOR IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT SHE WILL DO SO WHEN SHE RECEIVES IT
AND ACQUITTED THEMSELVES WITH CREDIT THEN ELEANOR'S TURN CAME HANDING HER COAT WHICH SHE HAD TAKEN OFF AND CARRIED UPON HER ARM TO EDNA WRIGHT SHE WALKED PROUDLY OVER THEN WITHOUT A TRACE OF SELF CONSCIOUSNESS
BUT ALL THAT TINTAGGON HAD GUARDED AGAINST SLID HE GAVE BACK TO THE GODS VERY CALM THE SEA LIES NOW ABOUT TINTAGGON'S FEET WHERE HE STANDS ALL BLACK AMID CRUMBLED CLIFFS OF WHITE WITH RED ROCKS PILED ABOUT HIS FEET
AND LEANING FORWARD THEY CRIED OUT TO THE BAT AS HE PASSED UP AND DOWN BAT THAT SEEST ALL THINGS WHERE IS THE GOLDEN BALL AND THOUGH THE BAT ANSWERED NONE HEARD AND NONE OF THE WINDS HAD SEEN IT NOR ANY OF THE BIRDS
IT IS A HUNDRED TO ONE IF I SHOULD AVAIL MYSELF OF IT FOUR TIMES IN A YEAR IT WOULD SATISFY ME I DARE SAY TO KNOW THAT I HAD IT WILL YOU TRY THAT IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT I AM PLACED ON THE FOOTING I HAVE INDICATED
BUT MISTER DARNAY OBLIVION IS NOT SO EASY TO ME AS YOU REPRESENT IT TO BE TO YOU I HAVE BY NO MEANS FORGOTTEN IT AND A LIGHT ANSWER DOES NOT HELP ME TO FORGET IT IF IT WAS A LIGHT ANSWER RETURNED DARNAY I BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS FOR IT
ALL THE GODS MADE THEMSELVES STARS FOR TORCHES AND FAR AWAY THROUGH ALL THE SKY FOLLOWED THE TRACKS OF NIGHT AS FAR AS HE PROWLED ABROAD AND AT ONE TIME SLID WITH THE PLEIADES IN HIS HAND CAME NIGH TO THE GOLDEN BALL
NOR YET TO THE TALES OF TEMPLES IN LONE LANDS THAT THE EAST WIND TOLD HER WHO HAD STOOD BESIDE HER WHEN SHE FLUNG HER GOLDEN BALL BUT FROM FAR AWAY THE WEST WIND CAME WITH NEWS OF THREE GREY TRAVELLERS WRAPT ROUND WITH BATTERED CLOAKS
THEN UNDER THE WORLD WENT UMBORODOM WITH HIS THUNDER PANTING BEHIND HIM AND CAME IN THE DARK BEFORE THE MORNING FROM UNDERNEATH THE WORLD AND GAVE THE DAWNCHILD BACK HER GOLDEN BALL
AND SLID SHALL DIVE FROM THE THRESHOLD INTO THE SEA
AND HIS OTHER HAND AGAINST THE HEART THAT BEAT FOR HIM I THINK CHARLES POOR MISTER CARTON DESERVES MORE CONSIDERATION AND RESPECT THAN YOU EXPRESSED FOR HIM TO NIGHT INDEED MY OWN WHY SO THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE NOT TO ASK ME
IT WAS DARK WHEN THE CHILD INZANA THE DAWN FIRST FOUND HER GOLDEN BALL THEN RUNNING DOWN THE STAIRWAY OF THE GODS WITH TRIPPING FEET CHALCEDONY ONYX CHALCEDONY ONYX STEP BY STEP SHE CAST HER GOLDEN BALL ACROSS THE SKY
THEN ON AN ONYX STEP INZANA SAT DOWN AND WEPT WHO COULD NO MORE BE HAPPY WITHOUT HER GOLDEN BALL AND AGAIN THE GODS WERE SORRY AND THE SOUTH WIND CAME TO TELL HER TALES OF MOST ENCHANTED ISLANDS TO WHOM SHE LISTENED NOT
WILL YOU PROMISE NOT TO PRESS ONE QUESTION ON ME IF I BEG YOU NOT TO ASK IT WILL I PROMISE WHAT WILL I NOT PROMISE TO MY LOVE WHAT INDEED WITH HIS HAND PUTTING ASIDE THE GOLDEN HAIR FROM THE CHEEK
AND THERE WERE ONLY THE EYES OF THE GODS IN THE DARKNESS PEERING FOR THE GOLDEN BALL THEN SAID THE GODS THOU HAST LOST THY GOLDEN BALL AND THEY MADE HER A MOON OF SILVER TO ROLL ABOUT THE SKY
AS THEY FLED WITH FLAPPING CLOAKS ALL RED AND GREY AND TATTERED HE LEAPT UP WITH THE GOLDEN BALL AND GAVE IT TO THE DAWNCHILD AGAIN INZANA TOSSED THE BALL INTO THE SKY MAKING THE THIRD DAY AND UP AND UP IT WENT
THAT HAS COME UPON THE EARTH AND HAVE STRIVEN AGAINST ITS ARMIES BUT COULD NOT DRIVE THEM FORTH AND THE NEW THING IS BEAUTIFUL BUT VERY ANGRY AND IS CREEPING TOWARDS THE GODS
AND FAR AWAY TROGOOL UPON THE UTTER RIM TURNED A PAGE THAT WAS NUMBERED SIX IN A CIPHER THAT NONE MIGHT READ AND AS THE GOLDEN BALL WENT THROUGH THE SKY TO GLEAM ON LANDS AND CITIES THERE CAME THE FOG TOWARDS IT
AND ALL WENT MARCHING ON TO ASSAIL THE CLIFFS OF THE GODS AND WHEREVER THE RIVERS HAD BROKEN THE RANKS OF THE CLIFFS
GENUINE TRUTH MISTER DARNAY TRUST ME I HAVE GONE ASIDE FROM MY PURPOSE I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT OUR BEING FRIENDS NOW YOU KNOW ME YOU KNOW I AM INCAPABLE OF ALL THE HIGHER AND BETTER FLIGHTS OF MEN IF YOU DOUBT IT ASK STRYVER AND HE'LL TELL YOU SO
AND WHEN THE WAVES WERE SCATTERED LIKE THOSE BEFORE THEM THE FEET OF THE CLIFFS WERE NO LONGER STANDING FIRM AND THEIR FACES WERE SCARRED AND BATTERED THEN INTO EVERY CLEFT THAT STOOD IN THE ROCKS SLID SENT HIS HUGEST WAVE AND OTHERS FOLLOWED BEHIND IT
THE NIGHT HATH SEIZED MY GOLDEN BALL AND NO GOD ALONE CAN FIND IT NOW FOR NONE CAN SAY HOW FAR THE NIGHT MAY ROAM WHO PROWLS ALL ROUND US AND OUT BEYOND THE WORLDS AT THE ENTREATY OF THEIR DAWNCHILD
AND THE GOLDEN BALL ROLLED FREE PASSING UNDER THE SHATTERED EARTH AND SO ROLLED BACK TO PEGANA AND LIMPANG TUNG CAME HOME TO THE ONYX STEP AND TOOK THE DAWNCHILD BY THE HAND AND TOLD NOT WHAT HE HAD DONE BUT SAID IT WAS THE EARTHQUAKE
AND MAKING A STIR AMONG THE HILLS CREPT DOWN TO FIND THE SEA AND PASSING ACROSS THE WORLD THEY CAME AT LAST TO WHERE THE WHITE CLIFFS STOOD AND COMING BEHIND THEM SPLIT THEM HERE AND THERE AND WENT THROUGH THEIR BROKEN RANKS TO SLID AT LAST
THERE ON THE SAND AMONG THE BATTERED NAVIES OF THE NAUTILUS AND BROKEN WEAPONS OF THE SWORDFISH HIDDEN BY DARK WATER HE FOUND THE GOLDEN BALL AND COMING UP IN THE NIGHT ALL GREEN AND DRIPPING
YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY SO AS A FASHION OF SPEECH BUT I DON'T MEAN ANY FASHION OF SPEECH INDEED WHEN I SAY I WISH WE MIGHT BE FRIENDS I SCARCELY MEAN QUITE THAT EITHER
STOOPING AS HE WALKED WITH HIS DARK BROWN CLOAK ABOUT HIM AND BEHIND HIM SLUNK THE NIGHT AND AS THE GOLDEN BALL ROLLED PAST THE FOG SUDDENLY NIGHT SNARLED AND SPRANG UPON IT AND CARRIED IT AWAY HASTILY INZANA GATHERED THE GODS AND SAID
BUT THE SONG THAT ONCE HAD TROUBLED THE STARS WENT MOANING ON AWAKING PENT DESIRES TILL FULL AT THE FEET OF THE GODS THE MELODY FELL THEN THE BLUE RIVERS THAT LAY CURLED ASLEEP OPENED THEIR GLEAMING EYES UNCURLED THEMSELVES AND SHOOK THEIR RUSHES
I THANK YOU DARNAY I MAY USE THAT FREEDOM WITH YOUR NAME I THINK SO CARTON BY THIS TIME THEY SHOOK HANDS UPON IT AND SYDNEY TURNED AWAY
AS TO THE GREAT SERVICE SAID CARTON
AND BADE THEM MARCH AGAINST SLID AND THE CLIFFS MARCHED DOWN TILL THEY CAME AND STOOD BEFORE SLID AND LEANED THEIR HEADS FORWARD AND FROWNED AND STOOD STAUNCH TO GUARD THE LANDS OF THE GODS AGAINST THE MIGHT OF THE SEA SHUTTING SLID OFF FROM THE WORLD
BUT MORAINES VANISH LIKE THE GLACIERS THAT MAKE THEM EVERY STORM THAT FALLS UPON THEM WASTES THEM CARRYING AWAY THEIR DECAYING DISINTEGRATING MATERIAL INTO NEW FORMATIONS UNTIL THEY ARE NO LONGER RECOGNIZABLE
SHE RECEIVED THE NAME AS SHE RECEIVED THE WATER FROM THE CLOUDS UPON HER BROW WHEN IT RAINED SHE WAS CALLED LITTLE FANTINE NO ONE KNEW MORE THAN THAT THIS HUMAN CREATURE HAD ENTERED LIFE IN JUST THIS WAY
BY SOIL AND BY THE COMPARATIVE STRENGTH OF EACH SPECIES IN TAKING AND HOLDING POSSESSION OF THE GROUND AND SO APPRECIABLE ARE THESE RELATIONS THE TRAVELER NEED NEVER BE AT A LOSS IN DETERMINING WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED FEET HIS ELEVATION ABOVE SEA LEVEL BY THE TREES ALONE
THE LAST BLACHEVELLE OF MONTAUBAN NATURALLY EACH OF THEM HAD HIS MISTRESS BLACHEVELLE LOVED FAVOURITE SO NAMED BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN IN ENGLAND
WITHOUT TRACING THEIR TRANSITIONAL FORMS DOWN THE RANGE FROM THOSE STILL IN PROCESS OF FORMATION IN SOME PLACES THROUGH THOSE THAT ARE MORE AND MORE ANCIENT AND MORE OBSCURED BY VEGETATION AND ALL KINDS OF POST GLACIAL WEATHERING IT APPEARS THEREFORE
IT IS EXCEEDINGLY SLENDER AND GRACEFUL ALTHOUGH TREES THAT CHANCE TO STAND ALONE SEND OUT VERY LONG CURVED BRANCHES MAKING A STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE ORDINARY GROVE FORM
THE FOLIAGE IS OF THE SAME PECULIAR GRAY GREEN COLOR AS THAT OF THE NUT PINE AND IS WORN ABOUT AS LOOSELY SO THAT THE BODY OF THE TREE IS SCARCELY OBSCURED BY IT
TO ALLOW THE HARD SHELL SEEDS TO BE BEATEN OUT THE CURIOUS LITTLE PINUS ATTENUATA IS FOUND AT AN ELEVATION OF FROM FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO THREE THOUSAND FEET GROWING IN CLOSE GROVES AND BELTS
WHEN ALL OTHER FRIENDS DESERT HE REMAINS WHEN RICHES TAKE WINGS AND REPUTATION FALLS TO PIECES HE IS AS CONSTANT IN HIS LOVE AS THE SUN IN ITS JOURNEY THROUGH THE HEAVENS
A SWARM OF BEES IN JULY IS NOT WORTH A FLY THE CUCKOO MAY SINGS ALL THE DAY JUNE CHANGES HIS TUNE JULY PREPARES TO FLY
SELDOM DIVIDING AT ALL EXCEPTING NEAR THE END BUT ANYTHING LIKE A BARE CABLE APPEARANCE IS PREVENTED BY THE SMALL TASSELED BRANCHLETS THAT EXTEND ALL AROUND THEM AND WHEN THESE SUPERB LIMBS SWEEP OUT SYMMETRICALLY ON ALL SIDES
THE DIFFERENT SPECIES ARE ARRANGED IN ZONES AND SECTIONS WHICH BRINGS THE FOREST AS A WHOLE WITHIN THE COMPREHENSION OF EVERY OBSERVER THESE SPECIES ARE ALWAYS FOUND AS CONTROLLED BY THE CLIMATES OF DIFFERENT ELEVATIONS
AS GREAT SMALL PRETTY WHITE OR BROWN INSTEAD OF NOUNS THE PRONOUNS STAND HIS HEAD HER FACE YOUR ARM MY HAND VERBS TELL SOMETHING TO BE DONE TO READ
AWAY FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE PREVAILING WINDS ALTHOUGH SO UNCONVENTIONAL WHEN FULL GROWN THE SUGAR PINE IS A REMARKABLY PROPER TREE IN YOUTH A STRICT FOLLOWER OF CONIFEROUS FASHIONS
AFTER MAKING ALL DUE ALLOWANCES FOR THESE LITTLE IRREGULAR HOUSEHOLDS
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRONE TO FALL ON THEIR KNEES AND DO US HONOR WHEN SUCCESS IS WITH US MAY BE THE FIRST TO THROW THE STONE OF MALICE WHEN FAILURE SETTLES ITS CLOUD UPON OUR HEAD
SOMEWHAT DISTURBED BY INTRIGUES BUT STILL RETAINING ON THEIR FACES SOMETHING OF THE SERENITY OF TOIL AND IN THEIR SOULS THAT FLOWER OF HONESTY WHICH SURVIVES THE FIRST FALL IN WOMAN ONE OF THE FOUR WAS CALLED THE YOUNG BECAUSE SHE WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THEM

WHAT IF THE JUNGFRAU WERE HUNGRY FAVOURITE HAVING BEEN IN ENGLAND
THE CEDAR OF LEBANON SAID SIR JOSEPH HOOKER OCCURS UPON ONE OF THE MORAINES OF AN ANCIENT GLACIER ALL THE FORESTS OF THE SIERRA ARE GROWING UPON MORAINES
WHICH SWEEP UP TO THE FEET OF THE SUMMIT PEAKS IN A DWARFED FRINGE TO A HEIGHT OF FROM TEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND FEET THAT THIS GENERAL ORDER OF DISTRIBUTION DEPENDS ON CLIMATE AS AFFECTED BY HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA IS SEEN AT ONCE
NO TWO ARE ALIKE AND THOUGH THEY TOSS OUT THEIR IMMENSE ARMS IN WHAT MIGHT SEEM EXTRAVAGANT GESTURES THEY NEVER LOSE THEIR EXPRESSION OF SERENE MAJESTY
AT THE AGE OF TEN FANTINE QUITTED THE TOWN AND WENT TO SERVICE WITH SOME FARMERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AT FIFTEEN SHE CAME TO PARIS TO SEEK HER FORTUNE FANTINE WAS BEAUTIFUL AND REMAINED PURE AS LONG AS SHE COULD SHE WAS A LOVELY BLONDE WITH FINE TEETH
A MAN'S DOG STANDS BY HIM IN PROSPERITY AND POVERTY IN HEALTH AND IN SICKNESS HE WILL SLEEP ON THE COLD GROUND WHEN THE WINTRY WINDS BLOW AND THE SNOW DRIVES FIERCELY IF ONLY HE MAY BE NEAR HIS MASTER'S SIDE
IF FORTUNE DRIVES THE MASTER FORTH AN OUTCAST INTO THE WORLD FRIENDLESS AND HOMELESS THE FAITHFUL DOG ASKS NO HIGHER PRIVILEGE THAN THAT OF ACCOMPANYING HIM TO GUARD HIM AGAINST DANGER TO FIGHT AGAINST HIS ENEMIES

AUGUST GO HE MUST RULES FOR RIDING KEEP UP YOUR HEAD AND YOUR HEART YOUR HANDS AND YOUR HEELS KEEP DOWN
NO TREE LOVER WILL EVER FORGET HIS FIRST MEETING WITH THE SUGAR PINE IN MOST PINE TREES THERE IS THE SAMENESS OF EXPRESSION WHICH TO MOST PEOPLE IS APT TO BECOME MONOTONOUS
ELEGANCE WAS SCANDINAVIAN AND CALEDONIAN THE PURE ENGLISH STYLE WAS ONLY TO PREVAIL LATER AND THE FIRST OF THE ARTHURS WELLINGTON HAD BUT JUST WON THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO
PURPLISH BROWN IN COLOR AND USUALLY ENLIVENED WITH TUFTS OF A YELLOW LICHEN TOWARD THE HEAD OF THIS MAGNIFICENT COLUMN LONG BRANCHES SWEEP GRACEFULLY OUTWARD AND DOWNWARD SOMETIMES FORMING A PALM LIKE CROWN
THE MAN IN THE MOON WAS RATHER LONESOME AND OFTEN HE PEEKED OVER THE EDGE OF THE MOON AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE EARTH AND ENVIED ALL THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED TOGETHER FOR HE THOUGHT
WE HAVE IN OUR SHIPS MALT MEAL AND CORN AND YOU HAVE RIGHT AND TITLE TO TAKE THEREFROM WHATEVER YOU WISH AND TO MAKE YOUR ENTERTAINMENT SUCH AS CONSORTS WITH YOUR MUNIFICENCE AND EIRIK ACCEPTED THE OFFER
THE NIGHTS ARE TOO HOT WHY
FOR A GOOD STRONG MOONBEAM AT LAST HE FOUND ONE THAT SEEMED RATHER SUBSTANTIAL AND REACHED RIGHT DOWN TO A PLEASANT LOOKING SPOT ON THE EARTH AND SO HE SWUNG HIMSELF OVER THE EDGE OF THE MOON
I WAS AWAKENED EARLY IN THE MORNING BY A WILD STORM WIND AND OF COURSE I HAD TO MAKE HASTE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE VALLEY TO ENJOY IT RUGGED TORRENTS AND AVALANCHES
THORHALL DISAPPEARED FROM SIGHT AND THEY WENT TO SEEK HIM AND SOUGHT FOR THREE HALF DAYS CONTINUOUSLY ON THE FOURTH HALF DAY KARLSEFNI AND BJARNI FOUND HIM ON THE PEAK OF A CRAG HE LAY WITH HIS FACE TO THE SKY
FIND THIS SNOW DUST IN A LOOSE CONDITION ON THE SLOPES ABOVE THE TIMBER LINE
SHAKING THE WHOLE VALLEY INTO ONE HUGE SONG YET INCONCEIVABLE AS IT MUST SEEM EVEN TO THOSE WHO LOVE ALL NATURE'S WILDNESS THE STORM WAS TELLING ITS STORY ON THE MOUNTAINS
OR IN STRATIFIED SHEETS IN THE GLACIER CIRQUES SOME OF IT TO REPLENISH THE SMALL RESIDUAL GLACIERS AND REMAIN SILENT AND RIGID FOR CENTURIES BEFORE IT IS FINALLY MELTED AND SENT SINGING DOWN HOME
WITH NOTHING TO BLUR THE SUBLIME PICTURE THEY MADE FANCY YOURSELF STANDING BESIDE ME ON THIS YOSEMITE RIDGE THERE IS A STRANGE GARISH GLITTER IN THE AIR AND THE GALE DRIVES WILDLY OVERHEAD
AND THEN HE SAILED OUT OF SIGHT AND LEFT THE MAN IN THE MOON TO REFLECT UPON WHAT HE HAD SAID THE WORDS OF THE ALDERMAN MADE HIM MORE ANXIOUS THAN EVER TO VISIT THE EARTH AND SO HE WALKED THOUGHTFULLY HOME
KARLSEFNI PREPARED HIS SHIP INTENDING TO GO TO GREENLAND SNORRI THORBRAND'S SON FROM ALPTAFJORDR
TO STAY WITH EIRIK DURING THE WINTER WHEN NOW YULE WAS DRAWING NIGH EIRIK BEGAN TO LOOK MORE GLOOMY THAN HE WAS WONT TO BE PRESENTLY KARLSEFNI ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM AND SAID ART THOU IN TROUBLE EIRIK
OR FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET IN BREADTH AND AS SHAPELY AND AS SUBSTANTIAL LOOKING IN TEXTURE AS THE BANNERS OF THE FINEST SILK ALL STREAMING AND WAVING FREE AND CLEAR IN THE SUN GLOW
YOU RE IN NORWICH THAT IS TRUE ANSWERED THE MAN WHO WAS QUITE BEWILDERED BY THIS IDEA AND OF COURSE YOU MUST BE CALLED SOMETHING CONTINUED THE MAGISTRATE WELL THEN SAID THE PRISONER
SCREAMED THE MAN WHY YOUR PORRIDGE IS SO HOT IT HAS BURNED ME FIDDLESTICKS SHE REPLIED THE PORRIDGE IS QUITE COLD TRY IT YOURSELF HE CRIED SO SHE TRIED IT
WELL THE MAN IN THE I MEAN THE MAN
KARLSEFNI WAS A MAN OF GOOD FAMILY AND VERY RICH HIS MOTHER'S NAME WAS THORUN HE ENGAGED IN TRADING JOURNEYS AND SEEMED A GOODLY BOLD AND GALLANT TRAVELLER ONE SUMMER
BUT AFTER THIS I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT BOTH THESE SHIPS CAME TO EIRIKSFJORDR ABOUT AUTUMN EIRIK RODE DOWN TO THE SHIPS WITH OTHER MEN OF THE LAND AND A MARKET FAIR WAS PROMPTLY INSTITUTED
HE LOOKED DOWN AND SAW AN ALDERMAN SAILING UP THROUGH THE AIR TOWARDS HIM THIS ALDERMAN WAS BEING TRANSLATED INSTEAD OF BEING TRANSPORTED OWING TO A MISPRINT IN THE LAW AND AS HE CAME NEAR
AND NOW AFTER THIS GENERAL VIEW MARK HOW SHARPLY THE RIBS AND BUTTRESSES AND SUMMITS OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE DEFINED EXCEPTING THE PORTIONS VEILED BY THE BANNERS
THE POLICEMAN ON THE FIRST CORNER SAW HIM RUNNING AND PROMPTLY ARRESTED HIM AND HE WAS MARCHED OFF TO THE MAGISTRATE FOR TRIAL WHAT IS YOUR NAME ASKED THE MAGISTRATE I HAVE N'T ANY REPLIED THE MAN
AND THE MAN WAS SO HUNGRY THAT HE TOOK A BIG SPOONFUL AT ONCE BUT NO SOONER HAD HE PUT IT INTO HIS MOUTH THAN HE UTTERED A GREAT YELL AND BEGAN DANCING FRANTICALLY ABOUT THE ROOM FOR OF COURSE
MANY AND SO GREAT THAT TWO MEN MIGHT WELL LIE ON THEM STRETCHED ON THEIR BACKS WITH HEEL TO HEEL POLAR FOXES WERE THERE IN ABUNDANCE THIS LAND THEY GAVE NAME TO AND CALLED IT HELLULAND
AND CUT IT UP AND STILL THEY KNEW NOT WHAT KIND OF WHALE IT WAS EVEN KARLSEFNI RECOGNISED IT NOT THOUGH HE HAD GREAT KNOWLEDGE OF WHALES IT WAS COOKED BY THE COOK BOYS AND THEY ATE THEREOF THOUGH BAD EFFECTS CAME UPON ALL FROM IT AFTERWARDS
SOME OF THE FAMOUS PEASE PORRIDGE THAT WAS MADE THERE AND FINALLY AFTER A LONG AND TIRESOME JOURNEY HE REACHED THE TOWN AND STOPPED AT ONE OF THE FIRST HOUSES HE CAME TO
FASTER AND FASTER SO THAT JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE EARTH HE LOST HIS HOLD AND CAME TUMBLING DOWN HEAD OVER HEELS AND FELL PLUMP INTO A RIVER THE COOL WATER
THEN WAS PREPARATION MADE FOR THE YULE FEAST AND SO MAGNIFICENT WAS IT THAT THE MEN THOUGHT THEY HAD SCARCELY EVER SEEN SO GRAND A FEAST AND AFTER YULE KARLSEFNI BROACHED TO EIRIK THE SUBJECT OF A MARRIAGE WITH GUDRID
THAT WANDERING WILLIE IS SOME RELATION OF HERS HE IS THE ONLY POOR PERSON ALMOST THE ONLY PERSON EXCEPT DAVIE I EVER SAW HER BEHAVE KINDLY TO HE WAS THERE LAST NIGHT AND ALSO I FANCY THAT OTHER TIME
THE RESCUER OF JAMIE DUFF BUT I DID NOT THINK OF THAT FOR A WHILE SHAKEN WITH TERROR AND AFRAID TO DISMOUNT AND BE NEXT THE GROUND I CALLED UPON ANDREW AS WELL AS MY FEAR WOULD PERMIT BUT MY VOICE WAS NEARLY UNMANAGEABLE
CHAPTER TWENTY NINE A DOUBLE EXPOSURE WHETHER THE KELPIE HAD RECOGNIZED US I COULD NOT TELL BUT NOT MUCH OF THE NEXT MORNING PASSED BEFORE MY DOUBT WAS OVER WHEN SHE HAD SET OUR PORRIDGE ON THE TABLE
AS IT APPEARED TO ME NOW SHE WAS STILL ALIVE HOWEVER VERY OLD AND BEDRIDDEN I RECOLLECTED THAT FROM THE TOP OF HER WOODEN BED HUNG A ROPE FOR HER TO PULL HERSELF UP BY WHEN SHE WANTED TO TURN FOR SHE WAS VERY RHEUMATIC
WHAT I HAD INTENDED AND HOW I HAD BEEN FRUSTRATED HE LISTENED SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AND SAYING SOMEONE OUGHT TO SEE IF ANYTHING WAS THE MATTER WITH THE OLD WOMAN TURNED IN TO PUT ON THE REST OF HIS CLOTHES
AT THE STABLE DOOR AND RODE AWAY SHE HAD SCARCELY BEEN OUT ALL DAY AND WAS RATHER IN THE MOOD FOR A RIDE THE VOICE OF ANDREW WHOM THE NOISE OF HER FEET HAD AROUSED CAME AFTER ME CALLING TO KNOW WHO IT WAS
EVERYTHING MY FATHER HEARD CONFIRMED THE TALE WE HAD TOLD HIM BUT THE KELPIE FRUSTRATED WHATEVER HE MAY HAVE RESOLVED UPON WITH REGARD TO HER BEFORE HE RETURNED SHE HAD DISAPPEARED
I WAS NOT TOO MUCH ABASHED TO TAKE NOTICE THAT THE KELPIE BRIDLED AT THIS I CAN'T SAY I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I'VE DONE TO HER I SAID REALLY RANALD YOU ARE IMPERTINENT I WOULD SEND YOU OUT OF THE ROOM AT ONCE
IF YOU GO I SHALL KNOW IT IS YOU AND HAVE YOU TAKEN UP AND TRIED FOR STEALING MEANTIME I SHALL GO THE ROUND OF THE PARISH I DO NOT THINK ALL THE POOR PEOPLE WILL HAVE COMBINED TO LIE AGAINST YOU THEY ALL HATE ME SAID THE KELPIE
WHO VISITED HER AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY MY FATHER I HEARD AFTERWARDS GAVE FIVE SHILLINGS OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET TO EVERY ONE OF THE POOR PEOPLE
SEVERAL TIMES SHE BROKE OUT ACCUSING ME OF TELLING A PACK OF WICKED LIES BUT MY FATHER TOLD HER SHE SHOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF DEFENDING HERSELF AND SHE MUST NOT INTERRUPT ME WHEN I HAD DONE HE CALLED TURKEY
I CANNOT SAY THAT I EVER HEARD HIM GIVE UTTERANCE TO ANYTHING OF THE SORT BUT WHENCE ELSE SHOULD I HAVE HAD SUCH A FIRM CONVICTION DATING FROM A PERIOD FARTHER BACK THAN MY MEMORY CAN REACH THAT WHATEVER MIGHT BECOME OF THE OTHER HORSES
THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE SHOULD FIND HER AGAIN IN THE NEXT WORLD AT ALL EVENTS I AM CERTAIN THAT IT WAS HARD FOR HIM TO BELIEVE THAT SO MUCH WISE AFFECTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN CREATED TO BE AGAIN UNCREATED
WHEN RANALD GOT SUCH A FRIGHT SHE HAS POOR RELATIONS SOMEWHERE AND SENDS THE MEAL TO THEM BY WILLIE YOU REMEMBER SIR THERE WERE NO OLD CLOTHES OF ALLISTER'S TO BE FOUND WHEN YOU WANTED THEM FOR JAMIE DUFF
AS WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS HOUSE I FELT A LITTLE CONFUSED FOR I NOW SAW CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT MY FATHER COULD NOT APPROVE OF OUR PROCEEDINGS I WHISPERED TO ALLISTER RUN AND FETCH TURKEY TELL HIM TO COME DIRECTLY
BOTH REFLECTIONS MADE IT HORRIBLE BESIDES IF MISSY SHOULD GET INTO THE BOG BUT SHE KNEW BETTER THAN THAT WILD AS HER MOOD WAS SHE AVOIDED IT AND GALLOPED PAST BUT BORE ME TO A FAR MORE FRIGHTFUL GOAL
FROM THAT TIME FORWARD SO LONG AS HE LIVED AT THE MANSE NOT EVEN LITTLE DAVIE CRIED WHEN HE FOUND THAT MISSUS MITCHELL WAS REALLY GONE IT WAS MORE HIS OWN AFFECTION THAN HER KINDNESS THAT HAD ATTACHED HIM TO HER
AT THE HEAD OF THE OLD WOMAN'S BED SO CAPABLE YET SO USELESS DID RETURN UPON ME WITH TERROR IN THE DUSK OF THAT LONELY NIGHT IT WAS MINGLED WITH A VAGUE SUSPICION THAT THE OLD WOMAN WAS A BIT OF A WITCH
TO RUIN HER A POOR LONE WOMAN WITH NO FRIENDS TO TAKE HER PART I DO NOT THINK IT LIKELY THEY COULD BE SO WICKED SAID MY FATHER SO I'M TO BE THE ONLY WICKED PERSON IN THE WORLD VERY WELL SIR
BUT EQUALLY UNJUSTIFIABLE AND YOU AS WELL AS HE ACTED THE PART OF A FOUR FOOTED ANIMAL LAST NIGHT I CONFESS I YIELDED TO TEMPTATION THEN FOR I KNEW IT COULD DO NO GOOD IT WAS ALL FOR THE PLEASURE OF FRIGHTENING HER
I BELIEVE THIS WAS A RIGHT INSTINCT GLAD OF A FOOLISH REASON I AM WISER NOW AND EXTEND THE HOPE TO THE REST OF THE HORSES FOR I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE GOD WHO DOES NOTHING IN VAIN EVER CREATES IN ORDER TO DESTROY
SUDDENLY DROPPING INTO A CANTER AND THEN STANDING STOCK STILL IT WAS A COTTAGE HALF IN RUINS OCCUPIED BY AN OLD WOMAN WHOM I DIMLY RECOLLECTED HAVING ONCE GONE WITH MY FATHER TO SEE A GOOD MANY YEARS AGO
HE WENT AND GOT IT APPEARING I THOUGHT NOT AT ALL OVER ANXIOUS ABOUT OLD BETTY AND I MEANTIME BUCKLED ON AN OLD RUSTY SPUR WHICH LAY IN THE STABLE WINDOW THE LEATHERS OF IT CRUMBLING OFF IN FLAKES
THEN I MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED IN BRINGING MISSUS MITCHELL TO REPENTANCE I COULD HAVE REASONED WITH HER ON THE MATTER AND SHOWN HER THAT SHE WAS NOT MERELY A THIEF BUT A THIEF OF THE WORST KIND A JUDAS WHO ROBBED THE POOR
THAT THE MAN WHO SLEPT WITH ONLY A WOODEN PARTITION BETWEEN HIM AND THE STABLE MIGHT NOT HEAR I SOON HAD THE BRIDLE UPON MISSY BUT WOULD NOT LOSE TIME IN PUTTING ON THE SADDLE I LED HER OUT GOT ON HER BACK WITH THE HELP OF A STONE
THAT FOR ANYTHING I COULD TELL IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EITHER THE TERROR WHICH IT WOKE IN MY MIND HAD RENDERED ME INCAPABLE OF MAKING ANY OBSERVATIONS OR SETTING DOWN ANY FACTS WITH REGARD TO IT
HAD THIS WORK ALWAYS READY FOR IT NOW THAT IT COULD STRIKE THE FINGERS OF THE KNITTING WOMEN WERE VICIOUS WITH THE EXPERIENCE THAT THEY COULD TEAR THERE WAS A CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF SAINT ANTOINE THE IMAGE HAD BEEN HAMMERING INTO THIS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
I KNOW HOW HARD IT HAS GROWN FOR ME THE WEARER OF THIS TO SUPPORT LIFE IN MYSELF BUT DO YOU KNOW HOW EASY IT HAS GROWN FOR ME THE WEARER OF THIS TO DESTROY LIFE IN YOU EVERY LEAN BARE ARM THAT HAD BEEN WITHOUT WORK BEFORE
MIX AN EGG IN IT FILL THE FISH WITH THIS AND SEW IT UP OR TIE A STRING ROUND IT PUT IT IN A DEEP PAN OR OVAL OVEN AND BAKE IT AS YOU WOULD A FOWL TO A LARGE FISH ADD HALF A PINT OF WATER
WHEN NOT ENGAGED IN MAKING FORAYS THROUGH THE BAR TO INFLICT BODILY AND MENTAL INJURIES OF AN ACUTE DESCRIPTION ON PASSING BOYS WHO WERE SMALL ENOUGH FOR HIS AMIABLE PURPOSE FATHER AND SON EXTREMELY LIKE EACH OTHER
TAKE OUT THE PAPER OR NAPKIN AND POUR IN THE OYSTERS SEND IT HOT TO TABLE A BALTIMORE OYSTER PIE MAKE A CRUST AFTER THE DIRECTIONS GIVEN FOR PUFF PASTE GREASE THE BOTTOM OF A DEEP DISH
WHILE THE TWINKLING EYES OF THE YOUTHFUL JERRY WERE AS RESTLESSLY WATCHFUL OF HIM AS OF EVERYTHING ELSE IN FLEET STREET THE HEAD OF ONE OF THE REGULAR INDOOR MESSENGERS ATTACHED TO TELLSON'S ESTABLISHMENT WAS PUT THROUGH THE DOOR AND THE WORD WAS GIVEN PORTER WANTED
WAS TEARING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE ROUSING THE WOMEN THE MEN WERE TERRIBLE IN THE BLOODY MINDED ANGER WITH WHICH THEY LOOKED FROM WINDOWS CAUGHT UP WHAT ARMS THEY HAD AND CAME POURING DOWN INTO THE STREETS BUT THE WOMEN WERE A SIGHT TO CHILL THE BOLDEST
WITH THE WILDEST CRIES AND ACTIONS VILLAIN FOULON TAKEN MY SISTER OLD FOULON TAKEN MY MOTHER MISCREANT FOULON TAKEN MY DAUGHTER
IT WAS AN OLD FASHIONED PLACE MOREOVER IN THE MORAL ATTRIBUTE THAT THE PARTNERS IN THE HOUSE WERE PROUD OF ITS SMALLNESS PROUD OF ITS DARKNESS PROUD OF ITS UGLINESS PROUD OF ITS INCOMMODIOUSNESS
LOOKING SILENTLY ON AT THE MORNING TRAFFIC IN FLEET STREET WITH THEIR TWO HEADS AS NEAR TO ONE ANOTHER AS THE TWO EYES OF EACH WERE BORE A CONSIDERABLE RESEMBLANCE TO A PAIR OF MONKEYS THE RESEMBLANCE WAS NOT LESSENED BY THE ACCIDENTAL CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE MATURE JERRY BIT AND SPAT OUT STRAW
FRESH SHAD IS BETTER TO BE SPRINKLED WITH SALT AN HOUR BEFORE IT IS PUT TO BROIL PUT A PLATE OVER THE TOP TO KEEP THE HEAT IN IN BROILING SHAD OR OTHER FRESH FISH YOU SHOULD DUST THEM WITH CORN MEAL BEFORE YOU PUT THEM DOWN TO BAKE A FRESH SHAD
ENCAMPED AT A QUARTER BEFORE NINE IN GOOD TIME TO TOUCH HIS THREE CORNERED HAT TO THE OLDEST OF MEN AS THEY PASSED IN TO TELLSON'S JERRY TOOK UP HIS STATION ON THIS WINDY MARCH MORNING WITH YOUNG JERRY STANDING BY HIM
OYSTERS PICKLED ANOTHER WAY WASH AND DRAIN THE OYSTERS AND PUT THEM IN SALT AND WATER THAT WILL BEAR AN EGG LET THEM SCALD TILL PLUMP AND PUT THEM IN A GLASS JAR WITH SOME CLOVES AND WHOLE PEPPERS
AND KEEP IT BOILING FAST A LARGE FISH WILL TAKE FROM HALF TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR A SMALL ONE FROM FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES A FAT SHAD IS VERY NICE BOILED ALTHOUGH ROCK AND BASS ARE PREFERRED GENERALLY
AND THE LAST FINISHING BLOWS HAD TOLD MIGHTILY ON THE EXPRESSION MADAME DEFARGE SAT OBSERVING IT WITH SUCH SUPPRESSED APPROVAL AS WAS TO BE DESIRED IN THE LEADER OF THE SAINT ANTOINE WOMEN ONE OF HER SISTERHOOD KNITTED BESIDE HER
THUS IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT TELLSON'S WAS THE TRIUMPHANT PERFECTION OF INCONVENIENCE AFTER BURSTING OPEN A DOOR OF IDIOTIC OBSTINACY WITH A WEAK RATTLE IN ITS THROAT
THE LEAST GOOD IN THE WAY OF PREVENTION IT MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN WORTH REMARKING THAT THE FACT WAS EXACTLY THE REVERSE BUT IT CLEARED OFF AS TO THIS WORLD THE TROUBLE OF EACH PARTICULAR CASE AND LEFT NOTHING ELSE CONNECTED WITH IT TO BE LOOKED AFTER
AND SILENTLY AND COMPOSEDLY LOOKED AT HIM WHILE THEY MADE READY AND WHILE HE BESOUGHT HER THE WOMEN PASSIONATELY SCREECHING AT HIM ALL THE TIME AND THE MEN STERNLY CALLING OUT TO HAVE HIM KILLED WITH GRASS IN HIS MOUTH
WHEN THEY ARE DONE TAKE THEM UP IN A DEEP COVERED DISH WITH BUTTERED TOAST IN THE BOTTOM A RICH OYSTER PIE STRAIN OFF THE LIQUOR FROM THE OYSTERS AND PUT IT ON TO BOIL WITH SOME BUTTER MACE NUTMEG PEPPER AND SALT
AND WHO DIED AND WENT TO HELL EVERYBODY FROM ALL THROATS THE NEWS IS OF HIM HE IS AMONG US AMONG US FROM THE UNIVERSAL THROAT AGAIN AND DEAD NOT DEAD HE FEARED US SO MUCH AND WITH REASON
LISTEN EVERYWHERE SAID MADAME AGAIN LISTEN TO HIM DEFARGE STOOD PANTING AGAINST A BACKGROUND OF EAGER EYES AND OPEN MOUTHS FORMED OUTSIDE THE DOOR ALL THOSE WITHIN THE WINE SHOP HAD SPRUNG TO THEIR FEET
AND WHEN COLD COVER THEM WITH VINEGAR TO BROWN OYSTERS IN THEIR OWN JUICE TAKE A QUART OF LARGE OYSTERS WASH THEM IN THEIR OWN JUICE DRAIN AND DIP THEM IN THE YELK OF EGGS
WHEN IT IS OF A LIGHT BROWN ON THE UNDER SIDE IT IS DONE
AND ACHIEVING THEM AGAIN IN GOSSIP GRADUALLY THESE STRINGS OF RAGGED PEOPLE SHORTENED AND FRAYED AWAY AND THEN POOR LIGHTS BEGAN TO SHINE IN HIGH WINDOWS AND SLENDER FIRES WERE MADE IN THE STREETS AT WHICH NEIGHBOURS COOKED IN COMMON
DIRECTLY DOWN UPON THE OLD PRISONER'S HEAD THE FAVOUR WAS TOO MUCH TO BEAR IN AN INSTANT THE BARRIER OF DUST AND CHAFF THAT HAD STOOD SURPRISINGLY LONG WENT TO THE WINDS AND SAINT ANTOINE HAD GOT HIM
GRATED BREAD SOAKED IN CREAM PUT IN THE OMELET SOME THINK AN IMPROVEMENT THE DRIPPING OF A NICE HAM SOME PERSONS USE FOR OMELET INSTEAD OF BUTTER TO BOIL EGGS HAVE THE WATER BOILING AND LOOK AT YOUR WATCH AS YOU PUT THEM IN
COULD HAVE WAKENED HIM UP AND HAD THE SAME SPEECH OUT OF HIM AS BEFORE THE BASTILLE FELL OR OLD FOULON WAS SEIZED
TELLSON'S THEY SAID WANTED NO ELBOW ROOM TELLSON'S WANTED NO LIGHT TELLSON'S WANTED NO EMBELLISHMENT
BUT WHICH ARE EITHER CURIOUS IN THEMSELVES OR PECULIAR TO THE TYPEES THERE WAS ONE SINGULAR CUSTOM OBSERVED IN OLD MARHEYO'S DOMESTIC ESTABLISHMENT WHICH OFTEN EXCITED MY SURPRISE EVERY NIGHT BEFORE RETIRING
IT WAS IN FAYAWAY'S DELICATE LITTLE HANDS ONE OF THE MOST GRACEFUL I HAVE EVER SEEN A YOUNG LADY IN THE ACT OF TORMENTING A GUITAR STRUNG ABOUT HER NECK BY A COUPLE OF YARDS OF BLUE RIBBON IS NOT HALF SO ENGAGING
AND SHAVEN HEADS DISPOSED IN A CIRCLE
PROCEEDS TO GRATE THE JUICY MEAT INTO FINE PARTICLES THIS IS DONE BY MEANS OF A PIECE OF MOTHER OF PEARL SHELL LASHED FIRMLY TO THE EXTREME END OF A HEAVY STICK WITH ITS STRAIGHT SIDE ACCURATELY NOTCHED LIKE A SAW
THE GIRLS WERE SOMETIMES IN THE HABIT OF PROCURING SMALL QUANTITIES OF SALT A THIMBLE FULL OR SO BEING THE RESULT OF THE UNITED LABOURS OF A PARTY OF FIVE OR SIX EMPLOYED FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE DAY THIS PRECIOUS COMMODITY THEY BROUGHT TO THE HOUSE
HIS NATIVE VALLEY AND THAT HE INTENDED TO RETURN TO IT THE SAME DAY AT ONCE IT STRUCK ME THAT COULD I BUT REACH THAT VALLEY UNDER HIS PROTECTION I MIGHT EASILY FROM THENCE REACH NUKUHEVA BY WATER AND ANIMATED BY THE PROSPECT WHICH THIS PLAN HELD OUT
THE ACTION OF THE OVEN HAVING CONVERTED IT INTO AN AMBER COLOURED CAKY SUBSTANCE A LITTLE TART BUT NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO THE TASTE BY ANOTHER AND FINAL PROCESS THE AMAR IS CHANGED INTO POEE POEE
ITS SURFACE IS DOTTED ALL OVER WITH LITTLE CONICAL PROMINENCES LOOKING NOT UNLIKE THE KNOBS ON AN ANTIQUATED CHURCH DOOR THE RIND IS PERHAPS AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS AND DENUDED OF THIS
THE KING WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE VERSE BUT THE CHORUS FAIRLY TRANSPORTED HIM AT HIS SOLICITATION I SANG IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE LUDICROUS THAN HIS VAIN ATTEMPTS TO CATCH THE AIR AND THE WORDS
AND EVEN DURING THE HOURS DEVOTED TO SLUMBER THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT WHICH I MADE SEEMED TO ATTRACT THE NOTICE OF THOSE WHO SHARED THE MATS WITH ME IN SPITE OF THESE OBSTACLES HOWEVER I DETERMINED FORTHWITH TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT
THE FLEETING SHADES OF THE EXPIRING DOLPHIN THE AUTUMNAL TINTS OF OUR AMERICAN FORESTS GLORIOUS AS THEY ARE SINK INTO NOTHING IN COMPARISON WITH THIS TREE
AND LOOKING SIGNIFICANTLY AT ME EXCLAIMED NOW YOU SEE YOU DO WHAT I TELL YOU AH THEN YOU DO GOOD YOU NO DO SO AH THEN YOU DIE
LAYING THEMSELVES DOWN BESIDE ME WOULD LEAVE ME AWHILE TO UNINTERRUPTED REPOSE I TOOK A STRANGE INTEREST IN THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENTS OF THE ECCENTRIC OLD WARRIOR ALL ALONE DURING THE STILLNESS OF THE TROPICAL MID DAY
BUT WHEN I DID SO MY VALET ALWAYS ROSE WITH ME AS IF DETERMINED I SHOULD NOT REMOVE MYSELF FROM HIS OBSERVATION FOR THE PRESENT THEREFORE I WAS OBLIGED TO ABANDON THE ATTEMPT BUT I ENDEAVOURED TO CONSOLE MYSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT BY THIS MODE
SEVERAL TIMES AFTER I REPEATED THE SAME MANOEUVRE BUT WITH AS LITTLE SUCCESS AS BEFORE AS MY PRETENCE FOR WITHDRAWING FROM THE HOUSE WAS TO ALLAY MY THIRST KORY KORY EITHER SUSPECTING SOME DESIGN ON MY PART
AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHOEVER HE WAS RETURNED TO HIS MAT THIS WAS A SAD BLOW TO ME BUT AS IT MIGHT HAVE AROUSED THE SUSPICIONS OF THE ISLANDERS TO HAVE MADE ANOTHER ATTEMPT THAT NIGHT I WAS RELUCTANTLY OBLIGED TO DEFER IT UNTIL THE NEXT
THE BREAD FRUIT HOWEVER IS NEVER USED AND IS INDEED ALTOGETHER UNFIT TO BE EATEN UNTIL SUBMITTED IN ONE FORM OR OTHER TO THE ACTION OF FIRE THE MOST SIMPLE MANNER IN WHICH THIS OPERATION IS PERFORMED AND I THINK THE BEST
AT THE TIME WHEN IT IS IN THE GREATEST PERFECTION THE FRUIT PRESENTS A BEAUTIFUL GLOBE OF WHITE PULP THE WHOLE OF WHICH MAY BE EATEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SLENDER CORE WHICH IS EASILY REMOVED
FIRST PLACING A CALABASH BENEATH THE NOSE AS IT WERE OF HIS CURIOUS LOOKING LOG STEED FOR THE PURPOSE OF RECEIVING THE GRATED FRAGMENTS AS THEY FALL MOUNTS ASTRIDE OF IT AS IF IT WERE A HOBBY HORSE
THIS IS THE FORM IN WHICH THE TUTAO IS GENERALLY CONSUMED THE SINGULAR MODE OF EATING IT I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED WERE IT NOT THAT THE BREAD FRUIT IS THUS CAPABLE OF BEING PRESERVED FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
I DISCLOSED IT IN A FEW BRIEF WORDS TO THE STRANGER AND ASKED HIM HOW IT COULD BE BEST ACCOMPLISHED MY HEART SUNK WITHIN ME WHEN IN HIS BROKEN ENGLISH HE ANSWERED ME THAT IT COULD NEVER BE EFFECTED KANAKA NO LET YOU GO NOWHERE
WERE THREE MAGNIFICENT BREAD FRUIT TREES AT THIS MOMENT I CAN RECAP TO MY MIND THEIR SLENDER SHAFTS AND THE GRACEFUL INEQUALITIES OF THEIR BARK ON WHICH MY EYE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DWELL DAY AFTER DAY
OR ELSE PROMPTED BY A DESIRE TO PLEASE ME REGULARLY EVERY EVENING PLACED A CALABASH OF WATER BY MY SIDE EVEN UNDER THESE INAUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES I AGAIN AND AGAIN RENEWED THE ATTEMPT
THE DIFFICULTY THUS PLACED IN MY WAY I DETERMINED TO OBVIATE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER I WOULD GET UP BOLDLY IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT AND DRAWING THE SLIDE ISSUE FROM THE HOUSE AND PRETEND THAT MY OBJECT WAS MERELY TO PROCURE A DRINK FROM THE CALABASH
FROM THE EXTRAVAGANT VALUE PLACED UPON THE ARTICLE I VERILY BELIEVE THAT WITH A BUSHEL OF COMMON LIVERPOOL SALT ALL THE REAL ESTATE IN TYPEE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED WITH A SMALL PINCH OF IT IN ONE HAND
GRASPING THE CALABASH ON HEARING MY REPLY THEY SANK BACK AGAIN AND IN A MINUTE OR TWO I RETURNED TO MY MAT ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE RESULT OF THE EXPERIMENT ONE AFTER ANOTHER THE SAVAGES TURNING RESTLESSLY
WHEN I REFLECTED THAT MY DREADFUL FATE WOULD FOR EVER BE CONCEALED FROM THEM AND THAT WITH HOPE DEFERRED THEY MIGHT CONTINUE TO AWAIT MY RETURN LONG AFTER MY INANIMATE FORM HAD BLENDED WITH THE DUST OF THE VALLEY
AND IF THEY COULD CAPTURE THEM THEY MIGHT ASK AS RANSOM FOR THEM A SUM A GREAT DEAL LARGER THAN THEY COULD EXPECT TO GET FROM THE PILLAGE OF AN ORDINARY TOWN BUT HAVANA WAS CONSIDERED TO BE TOO STRONG A PLACE FOR A PROFITABLE VENTURE
AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE TOWN NO DOUBT THOUGHT THAT WHEN HIS WELL ARMED HORSEMEN CHARGED UPON THESE MEN ACCUSTOMED TO FIGHTING ON THE DECKS OF SHIPS AND TOTALLY UNUSED TO CAVALRY COMBATS HE WOULD SOON SCATTER AND DISPERSE THEM BUT PIRATES ARE PECULIAR FIGHTERS
FOR JOHN ESQUEMELING ACCOMPANIED IT AND SO FAR AS THE FAME AND REPUTATION OF THESE ADVENTURERS WAS CONCERNED HIS PEN WAS MIGHTIER THAN THEIR SWORDS FOR HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HIS ACCOUNT OF THEIR DEEDS VERY LITTLE ABOUT THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE WORLD
INTO THE LITTLE VILLAGES AND PLANTATIONS IN THE COUNTRY AND EVEN HUNTERS AND SMALL FARMERS WERE CAPTURED AND MADE TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING THEY POSSESSED WHICH WAS WORTH TAKING FOR NEARLY THREE WEEKS THESE OUTRAGEOUS PROCEEDINGS CONTINUED
THAT UNLESS IN THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS A RANSOM OF TEN THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT WERE PAID TO THEM THEY WOULD BURN THE TOWN TO THE GROUND NO MATTER WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF THIS HEARTLESS DEMAND IT WAS NOT EASY FOR THE SCATTERED CITIZENS TO COLLECT SUCH A SUM AS THIS
BUT HE DELIBERATELY SELECTED HIS PROFESSION AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO ACQUIRE A KNOWLEDGE OF ITS PRACTICE THERE WAS A BUCCANEER SHIP ABOUT TO SAIL FROM JAMAICA AND ON THIS MORGAN ENLISTED HE WAS A CLEVER FELLOW
AND ABILITY AS A LEADER THE BUCCANEERS PROCEEDED TO MAKE VERY GOOD USE OF THEIR VICTORY THEY CAPTURED SOME SMALL ADJOINING ISLANDS AND BROUGHT THE CANNON FROM THEM TO THE MAIN FORTRESS
BUT WHEN THEY HAD GATHERED TOGETHER ALL THEY COULD DISCOVER THEY TORTURED THEIR POOR PRISONERS BY EVERY CRUEL METHOD THEY COULD THINK OF IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM TELL WHERE MORE TREASURES WERE CONCEALED MANY OF THESE UNFORTUNATES HAD HAD NOTHING TO HIDE
BUT THEY WERE NOT EXTINGUISHED UNTIL A QUARTER OF THE TOWN WAS ENTIRELY BURNED AND A FINE CHURCH REDUCED TO ASHES WHEN THE BUCCANEERS FOUND THEY COULD SQUEEZE NOTHING MORE OUT OF THE TOWN THEY WENT ON BOARD THEIR SHIPS CARRYING WITH THEM ALL THE PLUNDER AND BOOTY THEY HAD COLLECTED
AND FIND SOME OF THEIR TOWNSMEN WHO HAD ESCAPED WITH A PORTION OF THEIR TREASURE IN THOSE DAYS PEOPLE DID NOT KEEP THEIR WEALTH IN BANKS AS THEY DO NOW BUT EVERY MAN WAS THE CUSTODIAN OF MOST OF HIS OWN POSSESSIONS AND WHEN THEY FLED FROM THE VISITATION OF AN ENEMY
AND PROMISED THAT HE WOULD TAKE HIM TO JAMAICA AND DELIVER HIM TO JUSTICE BUT THE FRENCHMEN DECLINED TO BE SATISFIED THEY HAD RECEIVED BUT VERY LITTLE MONEY AFTER THEY HAD PILLAGED A RICH TOWN AND THEY BELIEVED THAT THEIR ENGLISH COMPANIONS WERE INCLINED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM IN EVERY WAY
HERE HE FOUND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO FIGHT HIS WAY INTO THE CITY AND PROBABLY MUCH TO HIS SURPRISE HIS MEN WERE PRESENTLY CHARGED BY A BODY OF CAVALRY PIRATES AS A RULE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HORSES EITHER IN PEACE OR WAR
THESE BLOODY PIRATES HAD ALWAYS CONQUERED IN THEIR DESPERATE FIGHTS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO RECKLESS AND SO SAVAGE BUT NOW THEY HAD FALLEN AMONG THOROUGHBRED SAVAGES MORE CRUEL AND MORE BRUTAL AND PITILESS THAN THEMSELVES
AND THEN HE SENT SOME MESSENGERS ASHORE TO INFORM THE ALREADY HALF RUINED CITIZENS THAT UNLESS THEY SENT HIM THIRTY THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT HE WOULD ENTER THEIR TOWN AGAIN CARRY AWAY EVERYTHING THEY HAD LEFT AND BURN THE PLACE TO THE GROUND THE POOR CITIZENS
AND HERE THE YOUNG MAN DETERMINED TO STUDY PIRACY HE WAS NOT A SAILOR AND HUNTER
NOW L'OLONNOIS PROPOSED TO HIS MEN THAT THEY SHOULD SAIL FOR GUATEMALA BUT HE MET WITH AN UNEXPECTED OBSTACLE THE BUCCANEERS WHO HAD ENLISTED UNDER HIM HAD EXPECTED TO MAKE GREAT FORTUNES IN THIS EXPEDITION
IN THE PLACES WHERE THESE MEN WERE ENLISTED THEY WERE TERMED SERVANTS BUT WHEN THEY GOT TO THE NEW WORLD THEY WERE GENERALLY CALLED SLAVES AND TREATED AS SUCH
TELLING THEM NOT TO BE IN TOO GREAT A HURRY TO PAY THE RANSOM DEMANDED BY THE PIRATES BECAUSE HE WAS COMING WITH A STRONG FORCE TO THEIR ASSISTANCE WHEN MORGAN READ THESE LETTERS HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A WISE THING NOT TO STAY IN THAT REGION ANY LONGER THAN COULD BE HELPED
SO HE DECIDED NOT TO WAIT FOR THE UNFORTUNATE CITIZENS TO COLLECT THE HEAVY RANSOM HE DEMANDED BUT TOLD THEM THAT IF THEY WOULD FURNISH HIM WITH FIVE HUNDRED HEAD OF CATTLE AND ALSO SUPPLY SALT AND HELP PREPARE THE MEAT FOR SHIPMENT HE WOULD MAKE NO FURTHER DEMANDS UPON THEM
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE BUT THEIR GREEDY SOULS WERE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE BOOTY THEY HAD ALREADY OBTAINED AND THEY THEREFORE SENT MESSAGES TO THE SPANIARDS WHO WERE STILL CONCEALED IN THE FORESTS
AND THE SPANIARDS GATHERED TOGETHER A SUFFICIENT FORCE TO RETAKE THE ISLAND OF SAINT CATHERINE
BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN MAKING A SECRET ATTACK AS HE HAD HOPED ONE OF HIS PRISONERS A SPANIARD LET HIMSELF DROP OVERBOARD AS SOON AS THE VESSELS CAST ANCHOR AND SWIMMING ASHORE
IT WAS AT LAST ARRANGED THAT THE CITIZENS SHOULD PAY TWENTY THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT WHICH WAS THE UTMOST SUM THEY COULD POSSIBLY RAISE AND IN ADDITION TO THIS FIVE HUNDRED HEAD OF BEEF CATTLE
THEY SWARMED OVER THE WALLS AND CARRIED THE PLACE AT THE EDGE OF THE CUTLASS AND THE MOUTH OF THE PISTOL IN THIS FIERCE FIGHT MORGAN PERFORMED SUCH FEATS OF VALOR THAT EVEN SOME OF THE SPANIARDS WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONERS WERE FORCED TO PRAISE HIS EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE
THIS WAS GIVEN AND THE TIME WAS OCCUPIED BY THE PEOPLE IN RUNNING AWAY INTO THE WOODS AND CARRYING OFF THEIR VALUABLES BUT WHEN THE TWO HOURS HAD EXPIRED L'OLONNOIS AND HIS MEN ENTERED THE TOWN AND INSTEAD OF RUMMAGING AROUND TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD FIND
THEY FREQUENTLY MET AMBUSCADES OF SPANIARDS WHO ENDEAVORED TO STOP THEIR PROGRESS BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE THE PIRATES WERE TOO STRONG IN NUMBER AND TOO SAVAGE IN DISPOSITION TO BE RESISTED BY ORDINARY CHRISTIANS AND THEY KEPT ON THEIR WICKED WAY
THERE WAS NOTHING ON EARTH THAT THEY WOULD BE SO GLAD TO FURNISH HIM AS A PILOT TO SHOW HIM HOW TO SAIL AWAY FROM THEIR SHORES THE PILOT WAS INSTANTLY SENT TO THE FLEET AND L'OLONNOIS AND HIS DEVASTATING BAND DEPARTED
AND I'VE ALWAYS FELT ASHAMED OF HAVING TAKEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN'S MONEY AND HERE'S SOME MORE I'VE ONLY KEPT BACK A FEW POUNDS WHICH BECKY MAY AS WELL HAVE
IT HAS BEEN SAID WAS HEART AND SOUL IN FAVOUR OF THE GENEROUS MAJOR HAVING AT FIRST DISLIKED BECKY FOR BEING THE MEANS OF DISMISSING HIM FROM THE PRESENCE OF HER MISTRESS
AND THE PUBLICAN SHUTTING HIS SHUTTERS IN THE SUNSHINE AGAINST SERVICE COMMENCED THE PEOPLE JOKED AT THE CAB STAND ABOUT HIS APPEARANCE AS HE TOOK A CARRIAGE THERE
AND SAY HIS PRAYERS IN THE MOSQUES
AND AS SHE LOOKED AT HER HUSBAND'S PORTRAIT OF NIGHTS IT NO LONGER REPROACHED HER PERHAPS SHE REPROACHED IT NOW WILLIAM WAS GONE EMMY WAS NOT VERY HAPPY AFTER HER HEROIC SACRIFICE
DON'T BE FRIGHTENED PITT I'M NOT DRUNK SHUT THE DOOR I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU PITT CLOSED THE DOOR AND CAME UP TO THE TABLE WHERE HE SAT DOWN IN THE OTHER ARM CHAIR
WITH WHICH AND LEAVING THE COLONEL TO DRESS HIMSELF MACMURDO TURNED ROUND TOWARDS THE WALL AND RESUMED THE PERUSAL OF BELL'S LIFE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HIS FRIEND'S TOILETTE WAS COMPLETE
INVITED BY THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE TO MEET HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
THERE HEARD OF HER FASCINATIONS AND WERE QUITE CURIOUS TO KNOW HER WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT SHE WAS NOBLE OF AN ANCIENT ENGLISH FAMILY THAT HER HUSBAND WAS A COLONEL OF THE GUARD
AND WAS WAITING FOR HER HUSBAND IN THE ADJOINING DINING ROOM WITH FEMALE INSTINCT AUGURING EVIL THE DOOR OF THE DINING ROOM HAPPENED TO BE LEFT OPEN AND THE LADY OF COURSE WAS ISSUING FROM IT
BREAKFAST WAS SO LATE THAT DAY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DELAYS WHICH HAD OCCURRED THAT THE CHURCH BELLS BEGAN TO RING WHILST THEY WERE SITTING OVER THEIR MEAL AND LADY JANE WAS TOO ILL SHE SAID
CAPTAIN MARKER IT'S ABOUT ABOUT MY WIFE CRAWLEY ANSWERED CASTING DOWN HIS EYES AND TURNING VERY RED THE OTHER GAVE A WHISTLE
IN A WAY WHICH EVEN MADE THE BOY SMILE SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE THOUGHT MAJOR WILLIAM WAS THE BEST MAN IN ALL THE WORLD THE GENTLEST AND THE KINDEST THE BRAVEST AND THE HUMBLEST
THE ELDER BROTHER WAS MUCH AFFECTED AND SHOOK RAWDON'S HAND WITH A CORDIALITY SELDOM EXHIBITED BY HIM RAWDON PASSED HIS HAND OVER HIS SHAGGY EYEBROWS
BUT ABOUT GOING HOME NEXT SATURDAY WHEN HIS FATHER WOULD CERTAINLY TIP HIM AND PERHAPS WOULD TAKE HIM TO THE PLAY HE'S A REGULAR TRUMP THAT BOY THE FATHER WENT ON STILL MUSING ABOUT HIS SON
CAME TO DINE WITH JOS AND THEN CAME EVERY DAY TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO BECKY POOR EMMY WHO WAS NEVER VERY TALKATIVE AND MORE GLUM AND SILENT THAN EVER AFTER DOBBIN'S DEPARTURE WAS QUITE FORGOTTEN
THE MAN ADDED AFTER A PAUSE ONE OF THE SERVANTS IS OFF ALREADY
OTHERWISE HE WOULD BY NO MEANS PERMIT THE INTRODUCTION OF SUNDAY PAPERS INTO HIS HOUSEHOLD THE THEATRICAL CRITICISMS THE FIGHT FOR A HUNDRED POUNDS A SIDE BETWEEN THE BARKING BUTCHER
WATCHED OVER THEM WHEN NOBODY CARED FOR THEM HOW ALL HIS COMRADES ADMIRED HIM THOUGH HE NEVER SPOKE OF HIS OWN GALLANT ACTIONS HOW GEORGY'S FATHER TRUSTED HIM BEYOND ALL OTHER MEN
SPEEDILY MADE HIS WAY UP TO THE ROOM OF HIS OLD FRIEND AND COMRADE CAPTAIN MACMURDO WHO CRAWLEY FOUND TO HIS SATISFACTION WAS IN BARRACKS CAPTAIN MACMURDO
PITT STOOPED AND PICKED THEM UP AMAZED AT SO MUCH WEALTH NOT THAT RAWDON SAID I HOPE TO PUT A BULLET INTO THE MAN WHOM THAT BELONGS TO
AND THE DARK LOOKS OF HER HUSBAND THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE QUESTION OF BREAKFAST BETWEEN THEM RAWDON MUTTERED SOME EXCUSES ABOUT AN ENGAGEMENT SQUEEZING HARD THE TIMID LITTLE HAND
WHICH CONTAINS BIRTHS MARRIAGES AND DEATHS WHATEVER BECKY'S PRIVATE PLAN MIGHT BE BY WHICH DOBBIN'S TRUE LOVE WAS TO BE CROWNED WITH SUCCESS
IN HER MORNING GOWN WAS UP AND ABOVE STAIRS IN THE NURSERY SUPERINTENDING THE TOILETTES OF HER CHILDREN AND LISTENING TO THE MORNING PRAYERS WHICH THE LITTLE CREATURES PERFORMED AT HER KNEE
WHEN I'M IN THE ARMY WON'T I HATE THE FRENCH THAT'S ALL
THAN THEY HAD BEEN TO BESTOW THE SAME INESTIMABLE BENEFITS UPON AMELIA LOVE AND LIBERTY ARE INTERPRETED BY THOSE SIMPLE GERMANS IN A WAY WHICH HONEST FOLKS
AND AFTER HIS CONFERENCE WITH HIS BROTHER HE WAS GOING AWAY TO MAKE THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MEETING WHICH MUST ENSUE
SHE WAS VERY DISTRAITE NERVOUS SILENT AND ILL TO PLEASE THE FAMILY HAD NEVER KNOWN HER SO PEEVISH SHE GREW PALE AND ILL
EVEN THE HUNDRED POUNDS THAT JANE TOOK YOU LAST NIGHT WERE PROMISED TO MY LAWYER TO MORROW MORNING AND THE WANT OF IT WILL PUT ME TO GREAT INCONVENIENCE
AT THE START OF THIS EPISODE THE ORCHESTRA WAS PLAYING AND THE DANCERS WERE IN MOTION SUDDENLY GORDON AS THE HERO STRODE UP TO SHIRLEY AND UNMASKED HIM WITH A FEW BITTER WORDS WHICH LATER WOULD BE FLASHED UPON THE SCREEN IN A SPOKEN TITLE
I HEARD A WOMAN'S SCREAM MARILYN DID SHE THINK HIM DEAD ONCE IN THE CAR HEADED FOR THE NEAREST DRUG STORE GRASPING WILDLY AT THE SIDE OR AT THE BACK OF THE SEAT EVERY FEW MOMENTS
WOULD SEEM AS HEAVY AND SUBSTANTIAL AS THE WALLS AND BEAMS OF THE FINEST OLD MANSION EVEN THE INFERIOR MATERIALS IN THE GOWNS OF MOST OF THE GIRLS WOULD PHOTOGRAPH AS WELL AS THE MOST EXPENSIVE SILK IN FACT
WITH ALL THE HORROR WRITTEN INTO THAT STORY CONTAINED NOTHING AS FEARFUL AS THE MENACE TO THE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN ITS PRODUCTION SHIRLEY'S SKIN WAS COLD AND CLAMMY HIS FACE ALMOST RIGID WHILE CONSCIOUS HE WAS HELPLESS
KENNEDY FOUND THE LITTLE VIAL AND EXAMINED IT ATROPIN HE EJACULATED WALTER HE TURNED TO ME GET SOME PHYSOSTIGMIN QUICK HAVE MACKAY DRIVE YOU IT'S IT'S LIFE OR DEATH HERE I'LL WRITE IT DOWN PHYSOSTIGMIN
HE ASKED SOBERLY NOT EXACTLY BUT I WILL IDENTIFY THE GUILTY PERSON
CARRYING THE BAG WITH ITS INDISPUTABLE PROOF OF SOME PERSON'S GUILT WE MADE OUR WAY THROUGH THE FAMILIAR CORRIDOR BY THE DRESSING ROOMS OUT UNDER THE ROOF OF THE SO CALLED LARGE STUDIO THERE
AND DRANK THE CONTENTS EVIDENTLY HE KNEW HIS MANSFIELD WELL SLOWLY HE BEGAN TO ACT OUT THE CHANGE IN HIS APPEARANCE WHICH CORRESPONDED WITH THE ASSUMPTION OF CONTROL BY THE EVIL WITHIN
AND OF SOME OF THE BEST APPEARING EXTRAS AT ONE TIME HE ORDERED A PANORAMA EFFECT IN WHICH THE CAMERAS PAMMED SWEPT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER GIVING A SUCCESSION OF FACES AT CLOSE RANGE FINALLY
WENT THROUGH CONTORTIONS WHICH WERE HORRIBLE YET FASCINATING IT WAS ALMOST AS THOUGH A NEW FEARFUL BEING WAS CREATED WITHIN SIGHT OF THE ONLOOKERS NOT ONLY WAS THE FACE ALTERED BUT THE MAN'S STATURE SEEMED TO SHRINK
TO COUNTERACT THE DEPRESSION CAUSED BY ALL THE RECENT MELODRAMATIC AND TRAGIC HAPPENINGS HE HAD BROUGHT IN AN EIGHT PIECE ORCHESTRA ESTABLISHING THE MEN IN THE SET ITSELF SO AS TO GET FULL PHOTOGRAPHIC VALUE FROM THEIR JAZZ ANTICS
A PECULIAR BRIGHTNESS IN HIS EYES STRUCK ME AND I NUDGED KENNEDY BELLADONNA KENNEDY EXPLAINED WHEN HE WAS BEYOND EARSHOT OH I REMEMBERED ENID TOLD HIM TO USE IT WHAT
AS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SKIDDED AROUND CURVES AND LITERALLY HURDLED OBSTACLES I REMEMBERED A FORGOTTEN FACT ATROPIN THAT WAS BELLADONNA SIMPLY ANOTHER NAME FOR THE DRUG
AS WELL AS TO POINT SUSPICION TOWARD THE LEADING MAN IN THE MIDST OF MY REVERIE SHIRLEY APPROACHED AND PASSED US HE WAS IN THE GARB OF MEPHISTO LIKE THE OTHERS HE HAD NOT YET MASKED HIS FACE
NO CURE AT ALL I WAS UNABLE TO GET ANY MORE OUT OF KENNEDY HOWEVER MANTON I DETECTED IN THE BACKGROUND WITH PHELPS THE TWO MEN WERE ARGUING AS ALWAYS AND IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE BANKER WAS ACCOMPLISHING NOTHING
OF COURSE THE WHOLE WAS NOT PHOTOGRAPHED IN A CONTINUOUS STRIP FROM ONE CAMERA POSITION I SAW THAT KAUF MADE SEVERAL LONG SHOTS TO CATCH THE GENERAL ATMOSPHERE THEN HE MADE CLOSE UP SCENES OF ALL THE PRINCIPALS
DISPLAYING EYES WHICH TWINKLED THROUGH THEIR MASKS IN MOCKERY AT A WHOLLY INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPT AT CONCEALMENT ENID MAINTAINED HER STATELY CARRIAGE BUT MADE FULL USE OF THE DAZZLING WHITENESS OF HER TEETH
TO THE BEING WHO WAS A VERY INCARNATION OF EVIL FOR ONCE KAUF DID NOT REHEARSE THE SCENE SHIRLEY WAS OBVIOUSLY WEAKENED FROM HIS EXPERIENCE AND THE DIRECTOR WISHED TO SPARE HIM
WHERE WERNER AND MANTON HAD DISPENSED WITH MUSIC IN A DESPERATE EFFORT AT ECONOMY KAUF HAD REALIZED THAT MONEY SAVED IN THAT WAY WAS LOST THROUGH TIME WASTED WITH DISPIRITED PEOPLE
A SCENE OF GAYETY CONFRONTED US IN SHARP CONTRAST WITH THE GLOOMY ATMOSPHERE OF THE REST OF THE ESTABLISHMENT KAUF HOWEVER HAD THOROUGHLY DEMONSTRATED HIS GENIUS AS A DIRECTOR
SHIRLEY HAD LEFT THE STUDIO FLOOR APPARENTLY TO GO TO HIS DRESSING ROOM NOW I NOTICED THAT HE RETURNED AND PASSED CLOSE JUST IN TIME TO HEAR MILLARD'S QUESTION AND KENNEDY'S ANSWER HIS EYES DILATED
I ATTRACTED KENNEDY'S ATTENTION YOU DON'T WANT MILLARD TO GET AWAY I WHISPERED KENNEDY SENT MACKAY TO STOP HIM THE AUTHOR ACCOMPANIED THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WILLINGLY YES MISTER KENNEDY
AND MARILYN AND ENID OF COURSE WERE OUT ON THE FLOOR OF THE SUPPOSED BALLROOM GORDON I RECOGNIZED BECAUSE I REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS TO WEAR THE GARB OF A MONK MARILYN WAS EASILY PICKED OUT ALTHOUGH
ALL READY EVERYONE IN THE SET MASKS ON TAKE YOUR PLACES AT A SIGNAL THE ORCHESTRA STRUCK UP AND THE COUPLES STARTED TO DANCE IT WAS A WONDERFULLY COLORFUL SCENE AND I SAW THAT KAUF PROPOSED TO REHEARSE IT THOROUGHLY
AS SOON AS ALL COULD BE ASSEMBLED IN THE PROJECTION ROOM THE HEAVY MAN HAD NOT CARED TO FACE JUSTICE IN SO PROSAIC A MANNER WITH THE SAME SENSE OF THE MELODRAMATIC WHICH HAD LED HIM TO SLAY STELLA LAMAR IN THE TAKING OF A SCENE
HE ASKS US TO WAIT UNTIL HE GETS THIS ONE BIG SCENE IT'S THE CLIMAX OF THE PICTURE REALLY THE UNMASKING OF THE BLACK TERROR
HE MAY LOSE MORE THAN THAT MUTTERED MACKAY AND I WONDERED JUST WHOM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUSPECTED IS EVERYONE HERE I ASKED ALL SEVEN GORDON AND SHIRLEY OF THE MEN
MOURNING DOVES COOED AND THE SWEET NOTES OF YELLOW BIRDS FILLED THE SUNNY GROVE WITH SUGGESTIONS OF HAPPINESS A YELLOW BUTTERFLY WANDERED DOWN THE BLUE AISLES SUCH A SECURE RETREAT I RETURNED TO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN COMING IN OUT OF THE HOT YELLOW WORLD
WHAT SHE ONLY SUSPECTED WHAT SHE REALLY KNEW WE NEVER LEARNED SHE WAS A CHAMBERMAID IN THE HOTEL AT C AND IT WAS EVIDENTLY HER INTENTION TO BLACKMAIL DOCTOR WALKER HIS POSITION AT THAT TIME WAS UNCOMFORTABLE
POTASH SODA AND AMMONIA CAUSTIC POTASH OCCURS IN CYLINDRICAL STICKS IS SOAPY TO THE TOUCH HAS AN ACRID TASTE
HE SAT VERY UNCONCERNEDLY ON A LOW BRANCH RIGHT OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD BUT BILLY DID NOT RUN OVER HIM I FOUND TWO HUMMERS NESTS IN THE EUCALYPTUS DURING THE SUMMER ONE BUILDER WAS THE ONE THE PHOTOGRAPHER WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO CATCH BROODING
IT STRIKES BLUE WITH SOLUTION OF STARCH AND STAINS THE SKIN AND INTESTINES YELLOWISH BROWN LIQUID PREPARATIONS AS THE LINIMENT OR TINCTURE MAY BE TAKEN ACCIDENTALLY OR SUICIDALLY SYMPTOMS ACRID TASTE TIGHTNESS OF THROAT
SHE TOLD HIM THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG AND THAT THE BANK WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE THAT HIS FATHER WAS RESPONSIBLE OF THE CONSPIRACY SHE SAID NOTHING TO HER SURPRISE ARNOLD ALREADY KNEW THROUGH BAILEY THAT NIGHT THAT THINGS WERE NOT RIGHT
CAST MOVING SHADOWS OVER THE SUN TOUCHED LEAFY FLOOR GIVING A WHITE LIGHT TO THE GROVE FOR THE UNDERSIDES OF THE YOUNG EUCALYPTUS LEAVES ARE LIKE SNOW FROM THE STIFF SICKLE SHAPED UPPER LEAVES THE SUN GLANCED DAZZLING THE EYES
THERE WILL BE TWO WEDDINGS BEFORE LONG AND LIDDY HAS ASKED FOR MY HELIOTROPE POPLIN TO WEAR TO THE CHURCH I KNEW SHE WOULD SHE HAS WANTED IT FOR THREE YEARS AND SHE WAS QUITE UGLY THE TIME I SPILLED COFFEE ON IT WE ARE VERY QUIET JUST THE TWO OF US
FOR THE EUCALYPTUS ABSORBED ALL THE MOISTURE AND THAT MAY HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH ITS FREEDOM FROM SNAKES AND SCORPIONS THOUGH IT WOULD NOT EXPLAIN THE ABSENCE OF CATERPILLARS AND SPIDERS WHICH JUST THEN WERE SO COMMON OUTSIDE THOUGH IN THE GROVE A GREAT DEAL
WITH DEPOSITS OF SULPHUR LUNGS CONGESTED TREATMENT CHLORIDE OF SODIUM OR LIME IN DILUTE SOLUTION AND ORDINARY TREATMENT FOR IRRITANT POISONING FATAL PERIOD SHORTEST FIFTEEN MINUTES
JUST AT THE WRONG TIME THERE WAS A TERRIBLE SCENE THE GIRL WAS TOLD THAT SOMETHING OF THE KIND WAS NECESSARY THAT THE BANK WAS ABOUT TO CLOSE AND HER STEPFATHER WOULD EITHER AVOID ARREST AND DISGRACE IN THIS WAY OR KILL HIMSELF FANNY ARMSTRONG WAS A WEAKLING
IN SUCH A MARKED MANNER THAT WHEN WE PASSED A YOUNG DOVE A FEW YARDS FARTHER ON IT WAS EASY TO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
AND READILY DECOMPOSED BY THE FREE ACIDS OF THE STOMACH NITRATE OF BARIUM OCCURS IN OCTAHEDRAL CRYSTALS SOLUBLE IN WATER METHOD OF EXTRACTION FROM THE STOMACH DIALYSIS AS FOR OTHER SOLUBLE POISONS TESTS
DULL GREEN AND ALMOST ODORLESS THE SAME CHANGES ARE SEEN IN THE BARK FIRST THE TRUNKS ARE SMOOTH AND GREEN THEN THEY ARE HUNG WITH SHAGGY SHREDS OF BARK THIS IN TURN DROPS OFF SO THAT THE OLD TREES ARE SMOOTH AGAIN
SYMPTOMS BESIDES THOSE OF IRRITANTS GENERALLY VIOLENT CRAMPS AND CONVULSIONS HEADACHE DEBILITY DIMNESS OF SIGHT DOUBLE VISION NOISES IN THE EARS AND BEATING AT THE HEART THE SALTS OF BARIUM ARE ALSO CARDIAC POISONS

ALL WERE IN THE COURSE OF A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO GET INTO THE CHIMNEY ROOM LOUISE AND HER MOTHER HAD FROM THE FIRST BEEN THE GREAT STUMBLING BLOCKS THE PLAN HAD BEEN TO SEND LOUISE AWAY UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE FOR HER TO INTERFERE BUT SHE CAME BACK TO THE HOTEL AT C
IN ONE OF THE TREES WE CAME TO AN ENORMOUS NEST MADE OF THE UNUSUAL MATERIALS THAT ARE SOMETIMES CHOSEN BY THAT STRANGE BIRD THE ROAD RUNNER IT WAS AN EXCITING DISCOVERY FOR THAT WAS BEFORE THE ROAD RUNNER HAD COME TO THE RANCH HOUSE
LIKE MAGNESIUM SULPHATE SOLUBLE IN WATER AND BITTER IN TASTE CARBONATE OF BARIUM IS FOUND IN SHOPS AS A FINE POWDER TASTELESS AND COLOURLESS INSOLUBLE IN WATER BUT EFFERVESCING WITH DILUTE ACIDS
I RETIRED TO MY UPSTAIRS SITTING ROOM AND GOT OUT ELIZA KLINEFELTER'S LAVENDER SLIPPERS AH WELL THE FOSTER MOTHERHOOD WOULD SOON HAVE TO BE PUT AWAY IN CAMPHOR AGAIN THE NEXT DAY BY DEGREES I GOT THE WHOLE STORY
FATTY DEGENERATION OF LIVER KIDNEYS AND HEART BLOOD STAINED URINE PHOSPHORESCENT CONTENTS OF ALIMENTARY CANAL TREATMENT EARLY USE OF STOMACH PUMP AND EMETICS FOLLOWED BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF PERMANGANATE OF POTASSIUM
HE WENT UP TO THE EAST ENTRY AND IN THE BILLIARD ROOM GAVE THE CASHIER WHAT HE HAD REFUSED EARLIER IN THE EVENING THE ADDRESS OF PAUL ARMSTRONG IN CALIFORNIA AND A TELEGRAM WHICH HAD BEEN FORWARDED TO THE CLUB FOR BAILEY FROM DOCTOR WALKER
SOLUBLE IN WATER LIQUOR POTASSAE IS A STRONG SOLUTION OF CAUSTIC POTASH AND HAS A SIMILAR REACTION
WERE LITHE AND SLENDER SOME OF THEM COULD BE SPANNED BY THE HANDS THE ROWS WERE PLANTED TEN FEET APART BUT THE LONG BRANCHES INTERLACED SO ONE HAD TO BE ON THE ALERT IN RIDING DOWN THE LINES TO BEND LOW ON THE SADDLE OR PUSH ASIDE THE BRANCHES THAT OBSTRUCTED THE WAY
AND I TOOK A PERSONAL INTEREST IN EACH ONE OF THE INHABITANTS THE FIRST TIME WE STARTED TO GO UP AND DOWN THE AVENUES WE SCARED UP A PAIR OF TURTLE DOVES BEAUTIFUL DELICATELY TINTED GENTLE CREATURES FIT TENANTS OF THE LOVELY GROVE
SO IT WAS ALEX JACK BAILEY WHO HAD BEEN OUR GHOST NOT ONLY HAD HE ALARMED LOUISE AND HIMSELF HE ADMITTED ON THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE BUT HE HAD DUG THE HOLE IN THE TRUNK ROOM WALL AND LATER SENT ELIZA INTO HYSTERIA
CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR THE ODDS AND ENDS OF DOCTOR WALKER'S SENSATIONAL ESCAPE THAT NIGHT TO SOUTH AMERICA OF THE RECOVERY OF OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH AND SECURITIES IN THE SAFE FROM THE CHIMNEY ROOM
AND SHAKE THE IODINE MAY BE OBTAINED ON EVAPORATION AS A SUBLIMATE
AND SO ARE ALL THE INTERNAL ORGANS GASTRO ENTERITIS NEPHRITIS TESTS SPECTROSCOPE SHOWS BLOOD CONTAINS METHAEMOGLOBIN
BURNT THE LOCKS FROM HIS SAFE AND SECURED THE NECESSARY INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE
HE IS VERY RICH HAS NO RELATIONS AND HAS A PASSION FOR POWER THEN HE'LL BE HUNG SAID THE CHIEF RISING I DOUBT IT SAID THE OTHER PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF MONEY SELDOM GET HUNG YOU ONLY GET HUNG FOR WANTING MONEY
HE SAT UP WITH A SUDDENNESS WHICH CAUSED THE POLICE OFFICER TO START BACK IN ALARM LISTEN SAID T X GRASPING AN IVORY PAPERKNIFE SAVAGELY IN HIS HAND AND TAPPING HIS BLOTTING PAD TO EMPHASIZE HIS WORDS
IF HE HAD HAD DEALINGS WITH HIM IN TIMES PAST IF HE HAD MET AND SPOKEN TO HIM ON THAT EVENTFUL MORNING HE WOULD ASK HIM POINT BLANK IF IT WAS NOT HIS HAND THAT HAD THROWN HIM TO HIS DEATH BUT BRYCE HAD NO INTENTION OF MAKING ANY REVELATIONS JUST THEN
AND WITH THAT THE MIDDLE STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS ENDED AND THE LAST ONE CAME WATCHED BY BRYCE WITH INCREASING ANXIETY FOR IT WAS SOON EVIDENT FROM CERTAIN REMARKS MADE BY THE CORONER
ALL THIS I KNOW HE SAID PATIENTLY IF YOU WILL FURTHER UNFOLD THE SECRET DOSSIER SIR GEORGE I AM PREPARED TO BE THRILLED
SOUTHEAST CORNER OF PARADISE SAID CAMPANY SEVERAL TOMBS I COULD HAVE SPARED YOU THE TROUBLE OF LOOKING YOU'RE A REGULAR ENCYCLOPAEDIA ABOUT THE PLACE LAUGHED BRYCE I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW EVERY SPOUT AND GARGOYLE OUGHT TO ANSWERED THE LIBRARIAN
OBVIOUSLY IF THE TOMB OF RICHARD JENKINS WHO WAS BURIED IN PARADISE IN SEVENTEEN FIFTEEN
AND ILLUSTRATING HIS INSTRUCTION OR HIS ADMONITION WITH THE QUAINTEST PHRASEOLOGY NOW HE WAS TILTED BACK IN HIS OFFICE CHAIR AT AN ALARMING ANGLE SCOWLING AT HIS DISTRESSED SUBORDINATE WHO SAT ON THE EDGE OF A CHAIR AT THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS DESK
BUT I REMEMBER THE MACEDONIAN SHOOTING CASE IN SOUTH LONDON
THEN YOU'RE IN SOME DANGER T X SMILED THE CHIEF FOR ACCORDING TO MY ACCOUNT YOU'RE ALWAYS MORE OR LESS BROKE A GENIAL LIBEL SAID T X BUT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE BEING BROKE I SAW JOHN LEXMAN TO DAY YOU KNOW HIM THE CHIEF COMMISSIONER NODDED
THE ROOM IN WHICH HE LIVES IS PRACTICALLY A SAFE SIR GEORGE RAISED HIS EYEBROWS A SAFE HE REPEATED
A TELEPHONE BELL IN THE CORNER OF THE ROOM RANG SHARPLY AND T X PICKED UP THE RECEIVER HE LISTENED INTENTLY
HE HAD JUST SEEN THE BODY OF THE UNFORTUNATE MAN AND HAD LOOKED CAREFULLY AT THE FEATURES HE WAS NOT A MAN OF WHOM HE HAD ANY KNOWLEDGE WHATEVER HE COULD NOT RECOLLECT EVER HAVING SEEN HIM ANYWHERE AT ANY TIME HE KNEW LITERALLY NOTHING OF HIM
BRYCE TURNED TO THE INDEX AT THE END OF HIS BOOK AN INDEX WRITTEN OUT IN VARIOUS STYLES OF HANDWRITING AND WITHIN A MINUTE HE FOUND THE NAME HE WANTED THERE IT WAS PLAINLY BEFORE HIM
WHICH HE PROTESTED WAS CERTAINLY NOT THAT OF THE DEAD MAN IT SOON BECAME PLAIN THAT THE JURY SHARED THE CORONER'S BELIEF THAT VARNER IN HIS FRIGHT AND EXCITEMENT HAD BEEN MISTAKEN AND NO ONE WAS SURPRISED WHEN THE FOREMAN AFTER A VERY BRIEF CONSULTATION WITH HIS FELLOWS
IN CONSEQUENCE OF FINDING THE BOOK ABOUT BARTHORPE IN THE SUIT CASE SAID MITCHINGTON WE SENT A LONG TELEGRAM YESTERDAY TO THE POLICE THERE TELLING THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED
SIR GEORGE DROPPED HEAVILY INTO THE ARM CHAIR AND STRETCHED OUT HIS LONG THIN LEGS WHAT I WANT HE SAID LOOKING UP AT THE CEILING AND PUTTING HIS HANDS TOGETHER
THAT CONCLUDED MISTER CHILSTONE IS ALL I CAN TELL OF MY OWN KNOWLEDGE BUT HE ADDED DRAWING A NEWSPAPER FROM HIS POCKET HERE IS AN ADVERTISEMENT WHICH I NOTICED IN THIS MORNING'S TIMES AS I CAME DOWN YOU WILL OBSERVE HE SAID AS HE PASSED IT TO THE CORONER
THE OTHER'S THE REGISTER OF THOSE IN PARADISE AND THE CLOISTERS WHAT NAMES ARE YOU WANTING TO TRACE BUT BRYCE AFFECTED NOT TO HEAR THE LAST QUESTION HE WALKED OVER TO THE PLACE WHICH CAMPANY HAD INDICATED
HE TURNED FROM T X TO THE DISCOMFORTED INSPECTOR VERY LITTLE SAID T X I'VE HAD MANSUS ON THE JOB
HE HAS FOUND ALL THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND SAID T X WE DO NOT PERFORM MIRACLES IN THIS DEPARTMENT SIR GEORGE NOR CAN WE PICK UP THE THREADS OF A CASE AT FIVE MINUTES NOTICE
AND EVEN OVER THE TELEPHONE T X RECOGNIZED THE DISTRESS
THE ADVERTISEMENT IS AS FOLLOWS HE ANNOUNCED IF THIS MEETS THE EYE OF OLD FRIEND MARCO HE WILL LEARN THAT STICKER WISHES TO SEE HIM AGAIN WRITE J BRADEN
BEYOND THE TABLE IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM HE SAW AT ONCE THAT RANSFORD HOWEVER STRENUOUSLY HE MIGHT BE FIGHTING TO KEEP HIS FACE UNDER CONTROL
WHO CONDUCTED TO THE CORONER A MIDDLE AGED WELL DRESSED MAN WHOM BRYCE AT ONCE SET DOWN AS A LONDON COMMERCIAL MAGNATE OF SOME QUALITY BETWEEN THE NEW ARRIVAL AND THE CORONER AN INTERCHANGE OF REMARKS WAS AT ONCE MADE
THE ACCOUNT BEING OPENED HE PAID INTO IT A SUM OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS IN A DRAFT AT SIGHT DRAWN BY ONE OF THOSE AGENTS HE DREW NOTHING AGAINST THIS REMARKING CASUALLY THAT HE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY IN HIS POCKET FOR THE PRESENT HE DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE CHEQUE BOOK WHICH WAS OFFERED HIM
HIS CHEEKS HAD PALED HIS EYES WERE A LITTLE DILATED
BRYCE TURNED AWAY TOWARDS A WALL ON WHICH HUNG A NUMBER OF CHARTS AND PLANS OF WRYCHESTER CATHEDRAL AND ITS PRECINCTS IT WAS TO INSPECT ONE OF THESE THAT HE HAD COME TO THE LIBRARY
THE CHIEF OF THE POLICE IN THESE DAYS WAS A GREY MAN RATHER TIRED WITH A HAWK NOSE AND DEEP EYES THAT GLARED UNDER SHAGGY EYEBROWS
ANY MORE HE ASKED LET ME THINK SAID T X LOOKING UP AT THE CEILING
AS FOR HIMSELF HE WAS GOING TO TELL JUST AS MUCH AS HE PLEASED AND NO MORE
AND THAT THAT MAN WAS HIMSELF THE EVIDENCE GIVEN IN THE FIRST STAGES OF THE INQUIRY WAS ALL KNOWN TO BRYCE AND TO MOST PEOPLE IN THE COURT ALREADY
IT WAS AT THIS STAGE THAT THE CORONER SENT THE JURYMEN AWAY IN CHARGE OF HIS OFFICER TO MAKE A CAREFUL PERSONAL INSPECTION OF THE GALLERY IN THE CLERESTORY AND WHILE THEY WERE GONE THERE WAS SOME COMMOTION CAUSED IN THE COURT BY THE ENTRANCE OF A POLICE OFFICIAL
BUT HERE BRYCE MET HIS FIRST CHECK DOWN EACH SIDE OF THE OLD CHART DATED EIGHTEEN FIFTY THERE WAS A TABULATED LIST OF THE TOMBS IN PARADISE THE NAMES OF FAMILIES AND PERSONS WERE GIVEN IN THIS LIST
HE SAID THAT HE SHOULD SETTLE DOWN FOR A TIME AT SOME RESIDENTIAL HOTEL IN LONDON AND IN THE MEANTIME HE HAD ONE OR TWO CALLS OR VISITS TO MAKE IN THE COUNTRY WHEN HE RETURNED FROM THEM HE SAID HE WOULD CALL ON ME AGAIN HE GAVE ME VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT HIMSELF
