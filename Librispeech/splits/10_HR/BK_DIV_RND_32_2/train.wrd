O LORD WHEN I DO THINK OF MY DEPARTED I THINK OF THEE WHO ART THE DEATH OF PARTING OF HIM WHO CRYING FATHER BREATHED HIS LAST THEN RADIANT FROM THE SEPULCHRE UPSTARTED
EVEN THEN I THINK THY HANDS AND FEET KEPT SMARTING WITH US THE BITTERNESS OF DEATH IS PAST BUT BY THE FEET HE STILL DOTH HOLD US FAST
THEIR OWN BAD LOOK MY FOOLISH EYES DOTH DAZE THEY SEE THE GIFT SEE NOT THE GIVING HAND FROM THE LIVING ROOT THE APPLE DEAD I WRING FOURTEEN THIS VERSING
NOR TO MY FOWLING NET WILL ONE RETURN IS THE THING EVER OURS WE CANNOT KEEP BUT THEIR SOULS GO NOT OUT INTO THE DEEP WHAT MATTER IF WITH CHANGED SONG THEY COME BACK
THROUGH WHICH FLIES MANY A GOLDEN WINGED DOVE WELL WATCHED OF FANCY'S TENDER EYES UP BENT A HUNDRED POWERS WAIT ON ME MINISTERING A THOUSAND TREASURES ART AND KNOWLEDGE BRING WILL CONSCIENCE REASON TOWER THE REST ABOVE
EVER ABOVE MY COLDNESS AND MY DOUBT RISES UP SOMETHING REACHING FORTH A HAND THIS THING I KNOW BUT CANNOT UNDERSTAND IS IT THE GOD IN ME THAT RISES OUT BEYOND MY SELF TRAILING IT UP WITH HIM
IF SO IT PLEASED MY LIFE MY LOVE MADE ANGRY GOD SIXTEEN I SEE A DOOR A MULTITUDE NEAR BY IN CREED AND QUARREL SURE DISCIPLES ALL
TILL I AM ONE WITH ONENESS MANIFOLD I MUST BREED CONTRADICTION STRIFE AND DOUBT THINGS TREAD THY COURT LOOK REAL TAKE PROVING HOLD MY CHRIST IS NOT YET GROWN TO CAST THEM OUT
I EVERY MOMENT DRAW TO YOU MORE NEAR GOD IN US FROM OUR HEARTS VEIL AFTER VEIL KEEPS LIFTING TILL WE SEE WITH HIS OWN SIGHT AND ALL TOGETHER
HOW COULD I IN HONESTY HAVE DETAINED THEM IT WAS IN THE BARGAIN
TO BE PRESENT AT THE COMING ASHORE OF THE GREAT BUCCANEER ASHORE HE WENT PROBABLY FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO OBEY THE GENERAL EXPECTATION HIS MOOD WAS TACITURN HIS FACE GRIM AND SNEERING
AND STARED AT HIM BLANKLY INDIGNANT NOW OCH BE FRANK WITH ME HE URGED HER UNPARDONABLY TWILL BE A KINDNESS SO IT WILL FOR A MOMENT SHE STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH QUICKENED BREATHING
I CONFESS HE ADMITTED THAT THERE IS MUCH FORCE IN WHAT YOU SAY YOU TAKE A LOAD FROM MY MIND SAID CAPTAIN BLOOD I WOULD NOT APPEAR UNNECESSARILY HARSH ESPECIALLY SINCE I AND MY FRIENDS OWE YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR
HIS LORDSHIP MARVELLED AT HER MEMORY OF THESE NAMES AYE CAHUSAC WAS LEVASSEUR'S LIEUTENANT UNTIL HE DIED UNTIL WHO DIED LEVASSEUR
SO THAT YE MAY THINK LESS BADLY OF ME THAN YOU DO WHAT I THINK OF YOU CAN BE A VERY LITTLE MATTER TO YOU SIR THIS WAS A DISARMING STROKE
PRECISELY WHAT ANSWER HAVE YOU MAKE TO THE ADMIRAL A SMILE IRRADIATED THE FACE AND EYES OF CAPTAIN BLOOD I HAVE ANSWERED HIM THAT UNLESS WITHIN FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS WE HAVE HIS PAROLE TO STAND OUT TO SEA
I REALIZE THAT EVEN A PIRATE HAS HIS HONOUR AND FORTHWITH HE PROPOUNDED HIS OFFER
ESPECIALLY TO SEEK YOU YE'RE NOT BY ANY MEANS THE FIRST TO DO THAT THE OTHER SCOFFED
SAID THE SPANIARD PENSIVELY HE SWUNG HIS LEGS FROM THE COUCH AND SAT NOW UPON THE EDGE OF IT HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES
THEN LISTEN AND OUT CAME THE TALE THAT WOLVERSTONE HAD TOLD THE CAPTAIN STEADIED HIMSELF TO GRASP IT IT'LL DO AS WELL ASERTRUTH SAID HE WHEN WOLVERSTONE HAD FINISHED
AT FIRST THE BUCCANEERS JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WOLVERSTONE WAS FOLLOWING WITH SOME RARE PRIZE OF WAR BUT GRADUALLY FROM THE REDUCED CREW OF THE ARABELLA A VERY DIFFERENT TALE LEAKED OUT TO STEM THEIR SATISFACTION AND CONVERT IT INTO PERPLEXITY
WHO HAD ALREADY DEPARTED MISS BISHOP DETAINED HIM WITH A QUESTION MISTER PITT SHE ASKED WERE YOU NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO ESCAPED FROM BARBADOS WITH CAPTAIN BLOOD I WAS I TOO WAS ONE OF YOUR UNCLE'S SLAVES
AND AND PETER DELIVERED HER OUT OF HIS DIRTY CLUTCHES HE WAS A BLACK HEARTED SCOUNDREL AND DESERVED WHAT PETER GAVE HIM I SEE AND AND YET CAPTAIN BLOOD HAS NOT MARRIED HER
THAT STIRRED THROUGH THE PURPLE DARKNESS OF THE TROPICAL NIGHT
CHAPTER TEN DON DIEGO
OR EVEN A MAN I LIKED AS WELL YET THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE WITH HIM SO I HEARD SHE ADMITTED IN A SMALL VOICE SHE WAS VERY WHITE AND SHE KEPT HER EYES UPON HER FOLDED HANDS
HE SCANNED THE SEAS FOR THE CONQUEROR IN THE BATTLE OF WHICH THIS GRIM EVIDENCE WAS ADDED TO THAT OF THE SOUNDS THEY HAD HEARD AND WHEN AT LAST AS THEY DREW CLOSER TO THE DOOMED VESSEL THEY MADE OUT THE SHADOWY OUTLINES OF THREE TALL SHIPS SOME THREE OR FOUR MILES AWAY STANDING IN TOWARD PORT ROYAL
NEITHER BACKWARD NOR FORWARD COULD HE MOVE IT SEEMED HE WAS DEGENERATING VISIBLY UNDER THE EYES OF ALL HE HAD ENTIRELY LOST THE ALMOST FOPPISH CONCERN FOR HIS APPEARANCE AND WAS GROWN CARELESS AND SLOVENLY IN HIS DRESS
DISENGAGED HIS ARM FROM HIS LORDSHIP'S AND STOOD SQUARELY BEFORE HIM YE'RE MY GUEST ABOARD THIS SHIP SAID HE
I ASSURE YOU SIR THAT I WAS FULLY INFORMED OF ALL I DO NOT GRANT THE KING'S COMMISSION LIGHTLY DON'T YOU BY GOD
CHAPTER TWENTY TWO HOSTILITIES
NEVER HAD THEY BEEN SO FIRMLY RESTRAINED
ACCOMPANIED BY A CHUBBY LITTLE GENTLEMAN AMIABLE OF COUNTENANCE AMIABLE AND SELF SUFFICIENT OF MANNER MY CAPTAIN
SENT HIM ALMOST DAILY INVITATIONS TO FEW OF WHICH HE RESPONDED LATER AS THE RAINY SEASON APPROACHED ITS END HE WAS SOUGHT BY HIS CAPTAINS WITH PROPOSALS OF REMUNERATIVE RAIDS ON SPANISH SETTLEMENTS BUT TO ALL HE MANIFESTED AN INDIFFERENCE WHICH
THAT REGARDED HIM OUT OF A TAWNY SARDONIC FACE SET IN A CLUSTER OF BLACK RINGLETS BUT HE WAS TOO BEWILDERED TO MAKE ANY ANSWER THE STRANGER'S FINGERS TOUCHED THE TOP OF DON DIEGO'S HEAD
OF REDUCING YOUR FORT AT THE COST OF SOME LIVES I WARN YOU THAT YOU MAY EXPECT NO QUARTER FROM US AND THAT I SHALL BEGIN BY LEAVING A HEAP OF ASHES WHERE THIS PLEASANT CITY OF MARACAYBO NOW STANDS THE LETTER WRITTEN
LOUNGED PETER BLOOD A CALF BOUND WELL THUMBED COPY OF HORACE'S ODES NEGLECTED IN HIS HANDS FROM IMMEDIATELY BELOW HIM CAME THE SWISH OF MOPS AND THE GURGLE OF WATER IN THE SCUPPERS
THERE TO REFIT THE SHIPS BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO FORCE THE PASSAGE AND SO BACK TO MARACAYBO CAME THOSE DEFEATED VICTORS OF THAT SHORT TERRIBLE FIGHT AND IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN WANTING FURTHER TO EXASPERATE THEIR LEADER
TO EXPRESS IT HE LOOSED AN OATH IT WAS HIS ONLY EXPRESSION FOR EMOTION OF ALL KINDS THEN HE ROLLED FORWARD AND DROPPED INTO A CHAIR AT THE TABLE FACING THE CAPTAIN MY GOD PETER WHAT'S THIS RUM SAID PETER
THE IMPUDENCE OF IT LEFT CAHUSAC SPEECHLESS
RETURNING ABOARD HE HAD STEPPED ON TO HIS OWN DECK AGAIN THERE MEMORY ABRUPTLY AND INEXPLICABLY CEASED HE WAS BEGINNING TO TORTURE HIS MIND WITH CONJECTURE
HE GAVE IT WITH AN EXTREME ILL GRACE AND ONLY BECAUSE BLOOD MADE HIM REALIZE AT LAST THAT TO WITHHOLD IT LONGER WOULD BE DANGEROUS IN AN ENGAGEMENT HE MIGHT CONCEIVABLY DEFEAT BLOOD'S FOLLOWERS BUT CONCEIVABLY HE MIGHT NOT AND EVEN IF HE SUCCEEDED THE EFFORT WOULD BE SO COSTLY TO HIM IN MEN
HE FLUNG OUT AN ARM IN THE DIRECTION OF THE WAIST WHENCE CAME THE HALF MELANCHOLY CHANT OF THE LOUNGING BUCCANEERS AGAIN YOU MISAPPREHEND ME
SO IT'S HEIGH HO AND HEAVE A HO WHO'LL SAIL FOR THE MAIN WITH ME BLOOD FETCHED A SIGH AND THE GHOST OF A SMILE PLAYED OVER HIS LEAN SUN TANNED FACE
AND INDEED AWAY TO THE NORTHWEST FAINTLY VISIBLE AS A BANK OF CLOUDS APPEARED THE GREAT RIDGE OF THE BLUE MOUNTAINS WHOSE PEAKS WERE THRUST INTO THE CLEAR UPPER AIR ABOVE THE LOW LYING HAZE
OR OF MY LORD SUNDERLAND SINCE HE'S YOUR KINSMAN FOR HAVING THE IMPUDENCE TO SEND IT
HE SPOKE WITH A RESTRAINT WHICH I TRUST YOU WILL AGREE WAS ADMIRABLE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT THE SPANISH FLEET GUARDING THE BOTTLE NECK EXIT OF THE GREAT LAKE OF MARACAYBO AND AWAITING THERE THE COMING FORTH OF CAPTAIN BLOOD
THE CREW OF THE ARABELLA PRACTISED RETICENCE WITH THEIR BRETHREN IN TORTUGA DURING THOSE TWO DAYS BEFORE WOLVERSTONE'S ARRIVAL BUT THEY WERE NOT RETICENT ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE CIRCULATION OF CERTAIN UNEASY RUMOURS
HE BADE THEM BRING HIM FROM AMONG THE PRISONERS THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR OF MARACAYBO WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN AT GIBRALTAR DISCLOSING ITS CONTENTS TO HIM HE DESPATCHED HIM WITH IT TO DON MIGUEL
CAPTAIN BLOOD ALONE KEPT HIS HEAD SETTING A CURB UPON HIS DEEP CHAGRIN
AND LONG TONGUES OF FLAME WERE LICKING OUT TO CONSUME THE GALLEON BEATING BACK THOSE DARING SPANIARDS WHO TOO LATE
WHO HAD ELECTED TO SAIL WITH HIM ASSURED HIM THAT HE WAS NOT SINGULAR IN HIS BEWILDERMENT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN IS THAT THE ARABELLA OR IS IT THE GHOST OF HER THE OLD WOLF ROLLED HIS SINGLE EYE OVER DYKE AND OPENED HIS MOUTH TO SPEAK
AND THE ALMOST FOPPISH DAINTINESS OF JEREMY PITT HIS SOILED AND BLOOD STAINED SHIRT OF BLUE COTTON WAS OPEN IN FRONT TO COOL HIS HAIRY BREAST AND THE GIRDLE ABOUT THE WAIST OF HIS LEATHER BREECHES
LOOKING DOWN AT THE PHOSPHORESCENT GLEAM IN THE SHIP'S WAKE AND HIS OWN LAUGHTER STARTLED HIM BY ITS EVIL NOTE HE CHECKED SUDDENLY AND SHIVERED
TAKING WITH HIM THE TROOPS AND MARINERS HE HAD BROUGHT FROM FRANCE HE HAD LEFT BEHIND HIM AT CARTAGENA NOT ONLY THE EMPTY HANDED BUCCANEERS WHOM HE HAD SWINDLED
BUT SOMETHING REMAINED THE LAST THING THAT HE COULD HAVE EXPECTED SOMETHING TOWARDS WHICH THEY WERE RAPIDLY SAILING OVER THE TROPICAL SUNLIT SEA ALL THIS AGAINST WHICH HE NOW INVEIGHED SO BITTERLY WAS BUT A NECESSARY STAGE IN THE SHAPING OF HIS ODD DESTINY
TURBAN WISE ABOUT HIS HEAD IS IT THAT I HAVE NOT WARNED YOU FROM THE BEGINNING THAT ALL WAS TOO EASY HE DEMANDED BETWEEN PLAINTIVENESS AND FURY I AM NO FOOL MY FRIENDS
YOU CONCEIVE THE BITTERNESS OF HIS SOUL HE BEHELD HIMSELF TO BE AS THE DOG IN THE FABLE THAT HAD DROPPED THE SUBSTANCE TO SNATCH AT A DELUSIVE SHADOW
AS HE HELD THEM OUT IN PROTEST DEATH OF MY LIFE WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY NOW HE CRIED HIS VOICE HUSKY AND WITHOUT WAITING TO HEAR WHAT IT MIGHT BE HE RAVED ON I KNEW YOU NOT FRIGHTEN THE ADMIRAL SO EASY
THAT HE SHOULD ALTER HIS COURSE FOR US IS IN ITSELF MATTER FOR WONDER BUT THAT HE SHOULD TAKE A RISK ON OUR BEHALF THAT HE SHOULD VENTURE INTO JAMAICA WATERS IT AMAZES ME AS I HAVE SAID
AND IS IT LIKE THAT SAID CAPTAIN BLOOD WITH A QUIET SMILE THOUGH THE HEART OF HIM SANK AT THIS FAILURE OF HIS BLUSTER
BLOOD'S IRONY LAUGHED IN HIS EYES YET WHATEVER YOU MAY BE I WARN YOU THAT UNLESS YOU YIELD TO A DEMAND THAT I CONSIDER JUST AND THEREFORE UPHOLD YOU MAY LOOK FOR TROUBLE
CAPTAIN BLOOD AND THE GREATER PORTION OF HIS BUCCANEERS HAD BEEN AT THEIR POST ON THE HEIGHTS OF NUESTRA SENORA DE LA POUPA UTTERLY IN IGNORANCE OF WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE BLOOD ALTHOUGH THE MAN CHIEFLY IF NOT SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SWIFT REDUCTION OF THE CITY
THIEF AND PIRATE SHE HAD BRANDED HIM SHE SHOULD BE JUSTIFIED
THEY HOWEVER WERE TORN BETWEEN GREED AND APPREHENSION IF THEY WENT THEY MUST ABANDON THEIR SHARE OF THE PLUNDER WHICH WAS CONSIDERABLE AS WELL AS THE SLAVES AND OTHER PRISONERS THEY HAD TAKEN IF THEY DID THIS AND CAPTAIN BLOOD
YE SEE HE SAID AND SHRUGGED I'LL BE GETTING MY HAT AND CANE AND SWORD AND GO ASHORE IN THE COCK BOAT SEE IT MANNED FOR ME YE'RE GOING TO DELIVER YOURSELF INTO BISHOP'S HANDS PITT WARNED HIM
I HAVE SUNK OR CAPTURED THE VESSELS OF THE GREAT FLEET WITH WHICH YOU WERE TO COME TO MARACAYBO TO DESTROY US SO THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER IN CASE TO CARRY OUT YOUR BOAST EVEN WHEN YOUR REENFORCEMENTS ON THE SANTO NINO REACH YOU FROM LA GUAYRA
IT WAS A NARRATIVE THAT PAINTED RED AND WHITE BY TURNS THE SPANIARD'S COUNTENANCE HE PUT A HAND TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD AND THERE DISCOVERED IN CONFIRMATION OF THE STORY A LUMP AS LARGE AS A PIGEON'S EGG
THAT IS THE ISLAND OF BARBADOS WELL ASTERN ALL DAY WE HAVE BEEN SAILING EAST BEFORE THE WIND WITH BUT ONE INTENT TO SET AS GREAT A DISTANCE BETWEEN BARBADOS AND OURSELVES AS POSSIBLE BUT NOW ALMOST OUT OF SIGHT OF LAND WE ARE IN A DIFFICULTY
THE BUCCANEERS LABOURED AND SWEATED TO COMPLETE THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE ACTION THAT WAS TO PROCURE THEM THEIR DELIVERANCE TIME PRESSED THEY MUST STRIKE BEFORE DON MIGUEL DE ESPINOSA
SURE NOW I'LL BE BACK FOR DINNER SO I WILL BLOOD CLIMBED DOWN INTO THE WAITING BOAT BUT LAUGH THOUGH HE MIGHT HE KNEW AS WELL AS PITT THAT IN GOING ASHORE THAT MORNING HE CARRIED HIS LIFE IN HIS HANDS
AND EXTRAVAGANT STORIES OF DISCREDITABLE ADVENTURES DISCREDITABLE THAT IS FROM THE BUCCANEERING POINT OF VIEW OF WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD HAD BEEN GUILTY BUT THAT WOLVERSTONE CAME WHEN HE DID IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSION
DID YOU EVER SAIL WITH A FRENCHMAN NAMED CAHUSAC CAHUSAC PITT LAUGHED THE NAME EVOKED A RIDICULOUS MEMORY AYE
WOLVERSTONE LOOKED HIM OVER IN CONTEMPT THEN LAUGHED AND SPOKE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY ALL AROUND HIM OF COURSE WHAT ELSE AND HE LAUGHED AGAIN A LAUGH THAT SEEMED TO DYKE TO BE CALLING HIM A FOOL
WHEN WE WERE WELL AT SEA AND THE ARABELLA'S COURSE WAS LAID WRITES PITT IN HIS LOG I WENT TO SEEK THE CAPTAIN KNOWING HIM TO BE IN GREAT TROUBLE OF MIND OVER THESE EVENTS I FOUND HIM SITTING ALONE IN HIS CABIN HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS
HE HICCOUGHED RESOUNDINGLY AND SAGGED BACK LOOSELY IN HIS CHAIR OLD WOLVERSTONE STARED AT HIM IN SOMBRE SILENCE HE HAD LOOKED WITH UNTROUBLED EYE UPON MANY A HELL OF DEVILMENT IN HIS TIME BUT THE SIGHT OF CAPTAIN BLOOD IN THIS CONDITION FILLED HIM WITH SUDDEN GRIEF
WHICH WAS HIS OWN TO LOSE THIS PLEASANT CITY OF MARACAYBO ISN'T SO NO DOUBT HE'LL LOSE IT WITH FEWER MISGIVINGS I AM SORRY WASTE LIKE BLOODSHED IS A THING ABHORRENT TO ME BUT THERE YE ARE
AND ACCEPTED A SEAT ON THE LOCKER UNDER THE STEM WINDOWS YOU HAVE A GOOD FORCE HERE UNDER YOUR COMMAND MY CAPTAIN SAID HE SOME EIGHT HUNDRED MEN AND I UNDERSTAND THEY GROW RESTIVE IN IDLENESS THEY MAY GO TO THE DEVIL WHEN THEY PLEASE
WHETHER THEY WENT TO PETIT GOAVE
I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND HER BROWS WERE KNIT HOW HAVE I BEEN UNGRATEFUL AND TO WHOM TO WHOM TO CAPTAIN BLOOD DIDN'T HE COME TO OUR RESCUE DID HE HER MANNER WAS FRIGID
IT IS NEWS TO ME THAT INGRATITUDE IS A FAULT ONLY TO BE FOUND IN THE YOUNG AND THE FOOLISH I DIDN'T SAY SO MA'AM THERE WAS A TARTNESS IN HIS TONE EVOKED BY THE TARTNESS SHE HAD USED IF YOU WOULD DO ME THE HONOUR TO LISTEN
HAD NOT PITT HER MASTER HIMSELF SEIZED THE WHIPSTAFF AND PUT THE HELM HARD OVER TO SWING HER SHARPLY OFF TO STARBOARD SHE MUST HAVE SUFFERED STILL WORSE FROM THE SECOND VOLLEY THAT FOLLOWED FAST UPON THE FIRST
AND FOR EVER PARTED YET IN SPITE OF THIS IN SPITE EVEN OF THE PERSUASION THAT TO HER THIS REFLECTION THAT WAS HIS TORMENT COULD BRING NO REGRETS HE HAD KEPT THE THOUGHT OF HER EVER BEFORE HIM IN ALL THOSE WILD YEARS OF FILIBUSTERING
THEN THE SPANIARD BROKE OFF HIS GLANCE GREW STILL MORE TROUBLED
THE FIRST AND NATURAL ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THESE SHIPS MUST BELONG TO THE JAMAICA FLEET AND THAT THE BURNING VESSEL WAS A DEFEATED BUCCANEER AND BECAUSE OF THIS THEY SPED ON TO PICK UP THE THREE BOATS THAT WERE STANDING AWAY FROM THE BLAZING HULK
DON DIEGO AND WITH HIM SAILED HIS NEPHEW ESTEBAN WHOSE VINDICTIVE ZEAL EXCEEDED THE ADMIRAL'S OWN YET KNOWING ALL THIS CAPTAIN BLOOD COULD PRESERVE HIS CALM IN REPROVING THE COWARDLY FRENZY OF ONE FOR WHOM THE SITUATION
WHICH DID THEM HOWEVER LITTLE FURTHER DAMAGE OUT OF RANGE AT LAST THEY LAY TO
THAT CAPTAIN BLOOD WAS LIKELY TO AFFORD HIM HE REMEMBERED THE FATE OF LEVASSEUR SO HE CONFINED HIMSELF TO WORDS IT IS TOO MUCH YOU GO TOO FAR HE COMPLAINED BITTERLY LOOK YOU CAHUSAC
RENOUNCED THE INTENTION AFTER ALL THERE WOULD BE A DEAL OF TREASURE STILL HIDDEN IN CARTAGENA THEY WOULD REMAIN BEHIND TO EXTORT IT WHILST FITTING THEIR SHIPS FOR SEA LET BLOOD AND HAGTHORPE AND THOSE WHO SAILED WITH THEM DO AS THEY PLEASED
IF THE MISCHIEF IS OF YOUR WORKING YOUR WORDS HAVE RANKLED WITH HIM HE THREW THEM AT ME AGAIN AND AGAIN HE WOULDN'T TAKE THE KING'S COMMISSION
IN THOSE DAYS YOU HAD SOME CLAIM UPON MY KINDNESS YOU WERE JUST AN UNFORTUNATE GENTLEMAN THEN AND WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU BE CALLING ME NOW HARDLY UNFORTUNATE WE HAVE HEARD OF YOUR GOOD FORTUNE ON THE SEAS
THAT MADE MY UNCLE LEAVE HIS BARBADOS PLANTATIONS TO ACCEPT THE DEPUTY GOVERNORSHIP OF JAMAICA CAPTAIN BLOOD DOESN'T KNOW THAT OF COURSE SHE PAUSED WITH A LITTLE GESTURE OF HELPLESSNESS
WOLVERSTONE CONGRATULATED HIMSELF UPON THE DISCRETION HE HAD USED WITH DYKE
AS A CHARITABLE THOUGHT WITH WHICH TO MITIGATE HER JUDGMENT OF A MAN SHE HAD ONCE ESTEEMED SHE HAD NO CHARITY FOR HIM NO MERCY
BUT THERE WAS NO EXPLOSION SHE RECOVERED HATE HIM LORD WHAT A THOUGHT I DON'T REGARD THE FELLOW AT ALL THEN YE SHOULD MA'AM HIS LORDSHIP SPOKE HIS THOUGHT FRANKLY
TRUE WE MAKE HIM PAY BIG RANSOM FOR GIBRALTAR
AND STILL LESS HIS MEN RESENTMENT SMOULDERED AMONGST THEM FOR A WHILE TO FLAME OUT VIOLENTLY AT THE END OF THAT WEEK IN CARTAGENA IT WAS ONLY BY UNDERTAKING TO VOICE THEIR GRIEVANCE TO THE BARON THAT THEIR CAPTAIN WAS ABLE FOR THE MOMENT TO PACIFY THEM
BLOOD LOOKED AT HIM WITH A FAINT KINDLING OF INTEREST YOU ARE OFFERING TO TAKE US INTO THE FRENCH SERVICE HE ASKED ON WHAT TERMS MONSIEUR
HIS LORDSHIP'S MIND WENT SWIFTLY BUT CAREFULLY DOWN THESE AVENUES OF THOUGHT OBSERVING AND CONNECTING HAVING EXHAUSTED THEM HE DECIDED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM MISS BISHOP FOR THIS HE MUST WAIT UNTIL PITT AND WOLVERSTONE SHOULD HAVE WITHDRAWN
AND BAFFLED RANCOUR IN WHICH COLONEL BISHOP HELD HIM NOR WAS THAT THE WORST OF IT HE WAS ALLOWED PLAINLY TO PERCEIVE THAT IT WAS THE GRACEFUL ELEGANT YOUNG TRIFLER FROM SAINT JAMES'S LORD JULIAN WADE
THEN AT LAST ON THE FIRST OF THE EBB THEY DRIFTED SILENTLY DOWN TOWARDS THE BAR WITH ALL CANVAS FURLED SAVE ONLY THEIR SPILTSAILS WHICH SO AS TO GIVE THEM STEERING WAY WERE SPREAD TO THE FAINT BREEZE
AHEAD WENT THE IMPROVISED FIRE SHIP IN CHARGE OF WOLVERSTONE WITH A CREW OF SIX VOLUNTEERS EACH OF WHOM WAS TO HAVE A HUNDRED PIECES OF EIGHT OVER AND ABOVE HIS SHARE OF PLUNDER AS A SPECIAL REWARD NEXT CAME THE ARABELLA
I HAVE LETTERS FROM HIM DESIRING ME TO EQUIP A SUPPLEMENTARY SQUADRON AND RAISE A BODY OF NOT LESS THAN A THOUSAND MEN TO REENFORCE HIM ON HIS ARRIVAL WHAT I HAVE COME TO PROPOSE TO YOU MY CAPTAIN
HE DID NOT FIND CAPTAIN BLOOD ENCOURAGING
HE WOULD PRESENT A RECKONING FOR ALL THE PETTY AFFRONTS AND INSULTS TO WHICH THAT UNSPEAKABLE FELLOW NOW PROVED A SCOUNDREL HAD SUBJECTED HIM WE MUST FOLLOW HE DECLARED FOLLOW AND PUNISH AT FIRST THAT WAS THE GENERAL CRY
BUT IS THAT NECESSARY HE ASKED WITHOUT APPARENT PERTURBATION CAPTAIN BLOOD'S BLUE EYES APPROVED HIS BEARING ASK YOURSELF SAID HE
YET IT PROVED SOOTHING TO DON DIEGO BEING SO MUCH LESS STARTLING THAN THE THINGS HE WAS BEGINNING TO IMAGINE BUT ARE YOU NOT SPANISH THEN YOU FLATTER MY CASTILIAN ACCENT I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE IRISH
AND EVEN SHOULD WE NOT LOVE EACH OTHER FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS MUST WE THEN HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST EACH OTHER IF WE DO NOT LOVE EACH OTHER PERFECTLY AND THAT I AM FRIENDLY TO THEE AND OFTEN TOO FRIENDLY THAT KNOWEST THOU
AND A CHANGE CAME OVER HIS HEART AND IN TRUTH WHEN IT TURNED CLEAR BEFORE HIM THERE LAY A YELLOW POWERFUL ANIMAL AT HIS FEET
BUT THOU KNOWEST IT ALSO AND I SAID SOMETHING INTO HER EAR IN AMONGST HER CONFUSED YELLOW FOOLISH TRESSES THOU KNOWEST THAT O ZARATHUSTRA
UPRIGHTLY AND OPENLY MAYEST THOU HERE TALK TO ALL THINGS AND VERILY IT SOUNDETH AS PRAISE IN THEIR EARS FOR ONE TO TALK TO ALL THINGS DIRECTLY
WHO SHALL ONE DAY KINDLE THE LIGHT OF THE FUTURE OH HOW COULD I NOT BE ARDENT FOR ETERNITY AND FOR THE MARRIAGE RING OF RINGS THE RING OF THE RETURN NEVER YET HAVE I FOUND THE WOMAN BY WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN
A DOCTRINE APPEARED A FAITH RAN BESIDE IT ALL IS EMPTY ALL IS ALIKE ALL HATH BEEN AND FROM ALL HILLS THERE RE ECHOED ALL IS EMPTY ALL IS ALIKE ALL HATH BEEN
AS YET HATH MY WORD NOT REMOVED MOUNTAINS AND WHAT I HAVE SPOKEN HATH NOT REACHED MAN I WENT INDEED UNTO MEN
AT THEIR MODES OF CONSOLATION AND INGRATITUDE MAY THEY BECOME CONVALESCENTS AND OVERCOMERS AND CREATE HIGHER BODIES FOR THEMSELVES
ZARATHUSTRA HOWEVER SAT UPRIGHT ON HIS COUCH WITH AN ABSENT LOOK LIKE ONE RETURNING FROM LONG FOREIGN SOJOURN DID HE LOOK ON HIS DISCIPLES AND EXAMINED THEIR FEATURES
WHERE EVERY ONE SPITTETH AND SPEWETH THAT IS NOW MY TASTE
A USEFUL FOLLY HERE ALOFT CAN I NOW SPEAK FREER THAN IN FRONT OF MOUNTAIN CAVES AND ANCHORITES DOMESTIC ANIMALS WHAT TO SACRIFICE I SQUANDER WHAT IS GIVEN ME
FLYING TRESSES ROUND AWAY FROM THEE DID I SPRING AND FROM THY SNAKY TRESSES THEN STOODST THOU THERE HALF TURNED AND IN THINE EYE CARESSES
THIS HAD ZARATHUSTRA SPOKEN TO HIS HEART WHEN THE SUN AROSE
GOLD LUSTRE MAKETH PEACE BETWEEN MOON AND SUN UNCOMMON IS THE HIGHEST VIRTUE AND UNPROFITING BEAMING IS IT AND SOFT OF LUSTRE
MANY NEVER BECOME SWEET THEY ROT EVEN IN THE SUMMER IT IS COWARDICE THAT HOLDETH THEM FAST TO THEIR BRANCHES FAR TOO MANY LIVE AND FAR TOO LONG HANG THEY ON THEIR BRANCHES
AND ONCE MORE ZARATHUSTRA BECAME ABSORBED IN HIMSELF AND SAT DOWN AGAIN ON THE BIG STONE AND MEDITATED SUDDENLY HE SPRANG UP FELLOW SUFFERING
A SEER A PURPOSER A CREATOR A FUTURE ITSELF AND A BRIDGE TO THE FUTURE AND ALAS ALSO AS IT WERE A CRIPPLE ON THIS BRIDGE ALL THAT IS ZARATHUSTRA
FOR THE SAKE OF IT WE ARE FORGIVEN FOR LIVING AND THEREFORE SUFFERETH ONE LITTLE CHILDREN TO COME UNTO ONE TO FORBID THEM BETIMES TO LOVE THEMSELVES
ALL LICKSPITTLES AND THE MOST REPUGNANT ANIMAL OF MAN THAT I FOUND DID I CHRISTEN PARASITE IT WOULD NOT LOVE AND WOULD YET LIVE BY LOVE
TO MY LAST SIN CRIED ZARATHUSTRA AND LAUGHED ANGRILY AT HIS OWN WORDS WHAT HATH BEEN RESERVED FOR ME AS MY LAST SIN
WHO KNOWETH THE FICKLY FAINT HEARTED HUMAN SPECIES COULD THEY DO OTHERWISE THEN WOULD THEY ALSO WILL OTHERWISE THE HALF AND HALF SPOIL EVERY WHOLE
THEREUPON THE PHANTOM WITHDREW FROM ME TO ME THE CONVALESCENT WOULD IT NOW BE SUFFERING AND TORMENT TO BELIEVE IN SUCH PHANTOMS SUFFERING WOULD IT NOW BE TO ME AND HUMILIATION
HAVE EVEN BECOME NIGHT WATCHMEN THEY KNOW NOW HOW TO BLOW HORNS AND GO ABOUT AT NIGHT AND AWAKEN OLD THINGS WHICH HAVE LONG FALLEN ASLEEP FIVE WORDS
WOULD THAT A STORM CAME AND SHOOK ALL THIS ROTTENNESS AND WORM EATENNESS FROM THE TREE WOULD THAT THERE CAME PREACHERS OF SPEEDY DEATH
IF TIME THERE STILL WAS WHAT DO I KNOW THEREOF BUT AT LAST THERE HAPPENED THAT WHICH AWOKE ME THRICE DID THERE PEAL PEALS AT THE GATE
ONE DOTH NOT FLY INTO FLYING WITH ROPE LADDERS LEARNED I TO REACH MANY A WINDOW WITH NIMBLE LEGS DID I CLIMB HIGH MASTS TO SIT ON HIGH MASTS OF PERCEPTION SEEMED TO ME NO SMALL BLISS
THUS GOETH THE BODY THROUGH HISTORY A BECOMER AND FIGHTER AND THE SPIRIT WHAT IS IT TO THE BODY ITS FIGHTS AND VICTORIES HERALD ITS COMPANION
THOU GNASHEST ON ME SWEETLY WITH LITTLE WHITE TEETH
THOU GOEST THE WAY OF THE LOVING ONE THOU LOVEST THYSELF AND ON THAT ACCOUNT DESPISEST THOU THYSELF AS ONLY THE LOVING ONES DESPISE TO CREATE DESIRETH THE LOVING ONE
HATH THE TIME NOT LONG SINCE PASSED FOR ALL SUCH DOUBTS WHO MAY NOWADAYS AWAKEN SUCH OLD SLUMBERING LIGHT SHUNNING THINGS WITH THE OLD DEITIES
IT HEARD THE BOWELS OF EXISTENCE SPEAKING UNTO IT AND THEN IT SOUGHT TO GET THROUGH THE ULTIMATE WALLS WITH ITS HEAD AND NOT WITH ITS HEAD ONLY INTO THE OTHER WORLD BUT THAT OTHER WORLD
CHILD SIZED BUTTERFLIES LAUGHED AND MOCKED AND ROARED AT ME FEARFULLY WAS I TERRIFIED THEREBY IT PROSTRATED ME
YEA AN ATTEMPT HATH MAN BEEN ALAS MUCH IGNORANCE AND ERROR HATH BECOME EMBODIED IN US NOT ONLY THE RATIONALITY OF MILLENNIUMS
THUS DID I LEARN TO SLUR OVER WORDS THE GRAVE DIGGERS DIG FOR THEMSELVES DISEASES UNDER OLD RUBBISH REST BAD VAPOURS ONE SHOULD NOT STIR UP THE MARSH
ARISE NOW ARISE
THOU WAYLAYEST THYSELF IN CAVERNS AND FORESTS THOU LONESOME ONE THOU GOEST THE WAY TO THYSELF AND PAST THYSELF AND THY SEVEN DEVILS LEADETH THY WAY
NOBLE ENOUGH WAS HE TO DISAVOW BUT HE WAS STILL IMMATURE IMMATURELY LOVETH THE YOUTH AND IMMATURELY ALSO HATETH HE MAN AND EARTH
HAVE AGAIN BEEN SET AND WHENEVER I LIFT A CURTAIN A NIGHT MOTH RUSHETH OUT OF IT DID IT PERHAPS SQUAT THERE ALONG WITH ANOTHER NIGHT MOTH
KEYS DID I CARRY THE RUSTIEST OF ALL KEYS AND I KNEW HOW TO OPEN WITH THEM THE MOST CREAKING OF ALL GATES LIKE A BITTERLY ANGRY CROAKING
BOTH ALIKE HOSTILE TO ALL FLESH AND BLOOD OH HOW REPUGNANT ARE BOTH TO MY TASTE FOR I LOVE BLOOD
TOGETHER WITH THE HATRED OF THE GOOD AND JUST THE HEBREW JESUS THEN WAS HE SEIZED WITH THE LONGING FOR DEATH HAD HE BUT REMAINED IN THE WILDERNESS AND FAR FROM THE GOOD AND JUST
VERILY AN APPROPRIATOR OF ALL VALUES MUST SUCH BESTOWING LOVE BECOME BUT HEALTHY AND HOLY CALL I THIS SELFISHNESS ANOTHER SELFISHNESS
THE WILL IS A CREATOR ALL IT WAS IS A FRAGMENT A RIDDLE A FEARFUL CHANCE
HIM WHO IS OF MY TYPE WILL ALSO THE EXPERIENCES OF MY TYPE MEET ON THE WAY SO THAT HIS FIRST COMPANIONS MUST BE CORPSES AND BUFFOONS
TOO EARLY DIED THAT HEBREW WHOM THE PREACHERS OF SLOW DEATH HONOUR AND TO MANY HATH IT PROVED A CALAMITY THAT HE DIED TOO EARLY AS YET HAD HE KNOWN ONLY TEARS AND THE MELANCHOLY OF THE HEBREWS
AND PROMISING ONES THUS SHOULD ONE LEARN TO DIE AND THERE SHOULD BE NO FESTIVAL AT WHICH SUCH A DYING ONE DOTH NOT CONSECRATE THE OATHS OF THE LIVING THUS TO DIE IS BEST
MEANWHILE HOWEVER
IT WAS THE BODY WHICH DESPAIRED OF THE BODY IT GROPED WITH THE FINGERS OF THE INFATUATED SPIRIT AT THE ULTIMATE WALLS BELIEVE ME MY BRETHREN IT WAS THE BODY WHICH DESPAIRED OF THE EARTH
THEREWITH DO I TRAMPLE AND TROT OVER STICK AND STONE IN THE FIELDS UP AND DOWN AND AM BEDEVILLED WITH DELIGHT IN ALL FAST RACING MY STOMACH IS SURELY AN EAGLE'S STOMACH
FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY FIVE
THOU SWEET ROMP DOST ANNOY I DANCE AFTER THEE I FOLLOW EVEN FAINT TRACES LONELY WHERE ART THOU GIVE ME THY HAND OR THY FINGER ONLY
THERE HAVE I UNLEARNED SILENCE THAT HAST THOU LEARNED NOW SURELY O ZARATHUSTRA EVERYTHING DO I KNOW
THOSE WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE STORMS AND AGITATORS OF THE TREES OF LIFE BUT I HEAR ONLY SLOW DEATH PREACHED
THE CONSUMMATING DEATH I SHOW UNTO YOU WHICH BECOMETH A STIMULUS AND PROMISE TO THE LIVING HIS DEATH DIETH THE CONSUMMATING ONE TRIUMPHANTLY SURROUNDED BY HOPING
THEN PERHAPS WOULD HE HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE AND LOVE THE EARTH AND LAUGHTER ALSO BELIEVE IT MY BRETHREN HE DIED TOO EARLY HE HIMSELF WOULD HAVE DISAVOWED HIS DOCTRINE HAD HE ATTAINED TO MY AGE
HE THAT HATH A GOAL AND AN HEIR WANTETH DEATH AT THE RIGHT TIME FOR THE GOAL AND THE HEIR AND OUT OF REVERENCE FOR THE GOAL AND THE HEIR HE WILL HANG UP NO MORE WITHERED WREATHS
TO THE SPIDERS THEMSELVES AND TEACHETH THAT UNDER CROSSES IT IS GOOD FOR COBWEB SPINNING OR THEY SIT ALL DAY AT SWAMPS WITH ANGLE RODS AND ON THAT ACCOUNT
NO ONE CAN PROVE IT UNLESS HE HIMSELF PROVE IT I HAVE LONG WISHED THAT HE WOULD FOR ONCE PROVE IT THOROUGHLY PROVE AS IF HE HAD EVER PROVED ANYTHING PROVING IS DIFFICULT TO HIM
THOU KNOWEST IT WELL THE FAINT HEARTED DEVIL IN THEE WHICH WOULD FAIN FOLD ITS ARMS AND PLACE ITS HANDS IN ITS BOSOM AND TAKE IT EASIER
A SQUANDERER WITH A THOUSAND HANDS HOW COULD I CALL THAT SACRIFICING AND WHEN I DESIRED HONEY I ONLY DESIRED BAIT AND SWEET MUCUS AND MUCILAGE
I AM VERILY WEARY OF IT EVER THY SHEEPISH SHEPHERD TO BE THOU WITCH IF I HAVE HITHERTO SUNG UNTO THEE NOW SHALT THOU CRY UNTO ME
ALL THIS WENT ON FOR A LONG TIME OR A SHORT TIME
A BLESSING AND A DANGER TO THE LOWLANDERS THERE IS THE ORIGIN OF YOUR VIRTUE WHEN YE ARE EXALTED ABOVE PRAISE AND BLAME AND YOUR WILL WOULD COMMAND ALL THINGS AS A LOVING ONE'S WILL
I WALK AMONGST MEN AS THE FRAGMENTS OF THE FUTURE THAT FUTURE WHICH I CONTEMPLATE AND IT IS ALL MY POETISATION AND ASPIRATION TO COMPOSE AND COLLECT INTO UNITY
RICH SEA A SEA FULL OF MANY HUED FISHES AND CRABS FOR WHICH EVEN THE GODS MIGHT LONG AND MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO BECOME FISHERS IN IT AND CASTERS OF NETS
A CONQUEROR OR AN INHERITOR A HARVEST OR A PLOUGHSHARE A PHYSICIAN OR A HEALED ONE IS HE A POET OR A GENUINE ONE AN EMANCIPATOR OR A SUBJUGATOR A GOOD ONE OR AN EVIL ONE
AND FOR THE MARRIAGE RING OF RINGS THE RING OF THE RETURN NEVER YET HAVE I FOUND THE WOMAN BY WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN UNLESS IT BE THIS WOMAN WHOM I LOVE FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
BUT HOW COULD I BE JUST FROM THE HEART HOW CAN I GIVE EVERY ONE HIS OWN LET THIS BE ENOUGH FOR ME I GIVE UNTO EVERY ONE MINE OWN FINALLY MY BRETHREN
AND NOW DO THEY MALIGN EVEN THEIR MORNING VALOUR VERILY MANY OF THEM ONCE LIFTED THEIR LEGS LIKE THE DANCER TO THEM WINKED THE LAUGHTER OF MY WISDOM
THE SOOTHSAYER HOWEVER SHALL EAT AND DRINK AT MY SIDE AND VERILY I WILL YET SHOW HIM A SEA IN WHICH HE CAN DROWN HIMSELF THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA
INTO THUS WOULD I HAVE IT THAT ONLY DO I CALL REDEMPTION WILL SO IS THE EMANCIPATOR AND JOY BRINGER CALLED THUS HAVE I TAUGHT YOU MY FRIENDS
THIS YEA THIS ALONE IS REVENGE ITSELF THE WILL'S ANTIPATHY TO TIME AND ITS IT WAS VERILY A GREAT FOLLY DWELLETH IN OUR WILL
BRIGHTNESS OF MIDNIGHT WAS EVER AROUND ME LONESOMENESS COWERED BESIDE HER AND AS A THIRD DEATH RATTLE STILLNESS THE WORST OF MY FEMALE FRIENDS
HEAVY UNTO HIM ARE EARTH AND LIFE AND SO WILLETH THE SPIRIT OF GRAVITY
THEN HE LAUGHED FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART LOOKED AROUND HIM AND SPAKE THUS THAT I SPAKE OF SACRIFICES AND HONEY SACRIFICES IT WAS MERELY A RUSE IN TALKING AND VERILY
I LAY HOWEVER ON THE GROUND AND THE SWEAT FLOWED FROM MY LIMBS NOW HAVE YE HEARD ALL AND WHY I HAVE TO RETURN INTO MY SOLITUDE
ONE MY MOUTHPIECE IS OF THE PEOPLE TOO COARSELY AND CORDIALLY DO I TALK FOR ANGORA RABBITS AND STILL STRANGER SOUNDETH MY WORD UNTO ALL INK FISH AND PEN FOXES
OR DOTH IT SIT BEHIND A BIG STONE AND CATCH FLIES AND VERILY I AM WELL DISPOSED TO MINE ETERNAL FATE BECAUSE IT DOTH NOT HOUND AND HURRY ME BUT LEAVETH ME TIME FOR MERRIMENT AND MISCHIEF
AND HAD COVERED HIS FACE DURING THE TIME BUT WHEN HE HEARD ZARATHUSTRA LAUGH HE LOOKED UP WITH CURIOSITY AND SAID SLOWLY BUT WHY DOTH ZARATHUSTRA SPEAK OTHERWISE UNTO US THAN UNTO HIS DISCIPLES
AND FROM HIM WHO HATH TOO MUCH BEHIND COULDST THOU WELL ALSO TAKE AWAY A LITTLE THAT I THINK WOULD BE THE RIGHT METHOD TO MAKE THE CRIPPLES BELIEVE IN ZARATHUSTRA
BUT NOT A FINGER'S BREADTH WAS IT YET OPEN THEN DID A ROARING WIND TEAR THE FOLDS APART WHISTLING WHIZZING AND PIERCING IT THREW UNTO ME A BLACK COFFIN
AND FOR THE MARRIAGE RING OF RINGS THE RING OF THE RETURN NEVER YET HAVE I FOUND THE WOMAN BY WHOM I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHILDREN UNLESS IT BE THIS WOMAN WHOM I LOVE FOR I LOVE THEE O ETERNITY
FOR ONE DAY MUST IT YET COME AND MAY NOT PASS BY WHAT MUST ONE DAY COME AND MAY NOT PASS BY OUR GREAT HAZAR
THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA AND LEFT HIS CAVE GLOWING AND STRONG
LIKE THE SICK AND PERISHING THE SICK AND PERISHING IT WAS THEY WHO DESPISED THE BODY AND THE EARTH AND INVENTED THE HEAVENLY WORLD AND THE REDEEMING BLOOD DROPS BUT EVEN THOSE
HE HOWEVER WHO WHITEWASHETH HIS HOUSE BETRAYETH UNTO ME A WHITEWASHED SOUL WITH MUMMIES SOME FALL IN LOVE OTHERS WITH PHANTOMS
AND JUST THEY WOULD FAIN CRUCIFY THOSE WHO DEVISE THEIR OWN VIRTUE THEY HATE THE LONESOME ONES BE ON THY GUARD ALSO AGAINST HOLY SIMPLICITY ALL IS UNHOLY TO IT THAT IS NOT SIMPLE
THOU WILT ONE DAY CRY ALL IS FALSE THERE ARE FEELINGS WHICH SEEK TO SLAY THE LONESOME ONE IF THEY DO NOT SUCCEED THEN MUST THEY THEMSELVES DIE BUT ART THOU CAPABLE OF IT
THE LARGE CHECK PATTERN OF HIS FLANNEL SHIRT AND HIS OLD STAINED PANAMA HAT WERE AN ESTABLISHED DEFIANCE TO THE CONVENTIONALITIES OF SULACO HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE IMMACULATE CLEANLINESS OF HIS APPAREL HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR ONE OF THOSE SHIFTLESS EUROPEANS
OF NO LESS THAN A THOUSAND MISTER GOULD KNEW THAT VERY WELL AND ARMED WITH RESIGNATION HAD WAITED FOR BETTER TIMES BUT TO BE ROBBED UNDER THE FORMS OF LEGALITY AND BUSINESS WAS INTOLERABLE TO HIS IMAGINATION
HE LOOKED MORE ENGLISH THAN THE LAST ARRIVED BATCH OF YOUNG RAILWAY ENGINEERS THAN ANYBODY OUT OF THE HUNTING FIELD PICTURES IN THE NUMBERS OF PUNCH REACHING HIS WIFE'S DRAWING ROOM TWO MONTHS OR SO AFTER DATE IT ASTONISHED YOU TO HEAR HIM TALK SPANISH
BECAUSE SHE WAS GUIDED BY AN ALERT PERCEPTION OF VALUES SHE WAS HIGHLY GIFTED IN THE ART OF HUMAN INTERCOURSE WHICH CONSISTS IN DELICATE SHADES OF SELF FORGETFULNESS AND IN THE SUGGESTION OF UNIVERSAL COMPREHENSION CHARLES GOULD THE GOULD FAMILY
LOUD VOICED LADY OF FRENCH EXTRACTION THE DAUGHTER SHE SAID OF AN OFFICER OF HIGH RANK
WELL HE ARGUED MOCKINGLY YOU DO KEEP ME HERE WRITING DEADLY NONSENSE DEADLY TO ME IT HAS ALREADY KILLED MY SELF RESPECT AND YOU MAY IMAGINE HE CONTINUED HIS TONE PASSING INTO LIGHT BANTER
JUST OUT OF THE SCHOOLROOM HERSELF AS THE STANDARD BEARER OF A FAITH TO WHICH WE ALL WERE BORN BUT WHICH SHE ALONE KNEW HOW TO HOLD ALOFT WITH AN UNFLINCHING HOPE SHE HAD PERHAPS MORE GLOW AND LESS SERENITY IN HER SOUL THAN ANTONIA
BUT ACTUALLY WRITING IN HIS OWN HAND WITH PEN AND INK AND IT WAS TO BE SUPPOSED TAKING A COPY IN HIS OWN PRIVATE PRESS COPY BOOK INACCESSIBLE TO PROFANE EYES
AS THE YOUNGEST OF THOSE WHO FELL FOR THAT VERY CAUSE OF WHICH OLD GIORGIO VIOLA WAS A DRIFTING RELIC AS A BROKEN SPAR IS SUFFERED TO FLOAT AWAY DISREGARDED AFTER A NAVAL VICTORY
BUT TO RETURN TO MY NOISES THERE USED TO BE IN THE OLD DAYS THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS OUTSIDE THAT GATE WAR TRUMPETS I'M SURE THEY WERE TRUMPETS I HAVE READ SOMEWHERE THAT DRAKE WHO WAS THE GREATEST OF THESE MEN USED TO DINE ALONE IN HIS CABIN ON BOARD SHIP TO THE SOUND OF TRUMPETS
MY SISTER IS ONLY WAITING TO EMBRACE YOU MY FATHER IS TRANSPORTED WITH JOY I WON'T SAY ANYTHING OF MY MOTHER OUR MOTHERS WERE LIKE SISTERS THERE IS THE MAIL BOAT FOR THE SOUTH NEXT WEEK LET US GO THAT MORAGA IS A FOOL A MAN LIKE MONTERO IS BRIBED
HIS WIFE HAD WAITED FOR HIM AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS AND BEFORE HE GAVE HER THE PARTING KISS HE FINISHED THE CONVERSATION WHAT SHOULD BE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO US HE SAID IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO GOING BACK WHERE COULD WE BEGIN LIFE AFRESH
I DON'T MEAN TO SAY THAT I BECAME THEN CONSCIOUS OF ANY IMPENDING CHANGE IN MY MENTALITY
YOU MUST NOT FORGET THAT HE WAS BORN THERE SHE WOULD SET HER QUICK MIND TO WORK UPON THAT AND THEN MAKE THE INCONSEQUENT RETORT WHICH HE ACCEPTED AS PERFECTLY SAGACIOUS BECAUSE IN FACT IT WAS SO WELL AND YOU YOU WERE BORN THERE TOO
HE WAITED FOR A WHILE AND THEN I SHALL GO TO THE WALL HE SAID WITH A SORT OF JOCULAR DESPERATION EVEN THAT DECLARATION DID NOT MAKE HER LOOK AT HIM
COULD NOT DETECT THE SLIGHTEST QUIVER OF A FEATURE AT WHAT HE MUST HAVE HEARD SAID OF HIS PATRIOTISM PERHAPS HE HAD JUST DISMOUNTED ON HIS RETURN FROM THE MINE HE WAS ENGLISH ENOUGH TO DISREGARD THE HOTTEST HOURS OF THE DAY
AND WITH SUCH MALICIOUS GLANCES THAT MISTER GOULD'S BEST FRIENDS ADVISED HIM EARNESTLY TO ATTEMPT NO BRIBERY TO GET THE MATTER DROPPED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS INDEED IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A VERY SAFE PROCEEDING SUCH WAS ALSO THE OPINION OF A STOUT
SHE JESTED MOST AGREEABLY THEY THOUGHT AND CHARLES GOULD BESIDES KNOWING THOROUGHLY WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HAD SHOWN HIMSELF A REAL HUSTLER THESE FACTS CAUSED THEM TO BE WELL DISPOSED TOWARDS HIS WIFE
WHOSE BIG EMPTY HALLS DOWNSTAIRS SHELTERED UNDER THEIR PAINTED CEILINGS THE HARVESTS THE FOWLS AND EVEN THE CATTLE TOGETHER WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY OF THE TENANT FARMER THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD MET IN LUCCA
COFFEE PLANTERS MERCHANTS REVOLUTIONISTS OF COSTAGUANA THAT HE THE ONLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE THIRD GENERATION IN A CONTINENT POSSESSING ITS OWN STYLE OF HORSEMANSHIP WENT ON LOOKING THOROUGHLY ENGLISH EVEN ON HORSEBACK
I FANCY THAT THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF HANDLING IT REQUIRES HE MUSED ALOUD AS IF TO HIMSELF AND WHEN SHE WONDERED FRANKLY THAT A MAN OF CHARACTER SHOULD DEVOTE HIS ENERGIES TO PLOTTING AND INTRIGUES CHARLES WOULD REMARK WITH A GENTLE CONCERN THAT UNDERSTOOD HER WONDER
DONA EMILIA'S INTELLIGENCE BEING FEMININE LED HER TO ACHIEVE THE CONQUEST OF SULACO SIMPLY BY LIGHTING THE WAY FOR HER UNSELFISHNESS AND SYMPATHY SHE COULD CONVERSE CHARMINGLY BUT SHE WAS NOT TALKATIVE
THE ASPECT OF CONTINUED LIFE ANTONIA THE ARISTOCRAT AND NOSTROMO THE MAN OF THE PEOPLE ARE THE ARTISANS OF THE NEW ERA THE TRUE CREATORS OF THE NEW STATE HE BY HIS LEGENDARY AND DARING FEAT
NOW AFTER REACHING HIS EXALTED POSITION THAT POLITICIAN HAD PROCLAIMED HIS INTENTION TO REPAY EVIL WITH GOOD TO SENOR GOULD THE POOR MAN
HE EXPLAINED THOSE THINGS IT WAS LATE WHEN THEY PARTED SHE HAD NEVER BEFORE GIVEN HIM SUCH A FASCINATING VISION OF HERSELF ALL THE EAGERNESS OF YOUTH FOR A STRANGE LIFE FOR GREAT DISTANCES
IN THE MODERNIZED STREETS OF SULACO CALLING ON THE WIDOW OF THE CARGADOR ATTENDING THE LODGE LISTENING IN UNMOVED SILENCE TO ANARCHIST SPEECHES AT THE MEETING
AND ENDED WITH THE DECLARATION THE CHIEF OF THE STATE HAS RESOLVED TO EXERCISE TO THE FULL HIS POWER OF CLEMENCY THE MINE WHICH BY EVERY LAW INTERNATIONAL HUMAN AND DIVINE REVERTS NOW TO THE GOVERNMENT AS NATIONAL PROPERTY
FOR THE CONCESSION HAD BEEN GRANTED TO HIM AND HIS DESCENDANTS FOR EVER HE IMPLORED HIS SON NEVER TO RETURN TO COSTAGUANA NEVER TO CLAIM ANY PART OF HIS INHERITANCE THERE BECAUSE IT WAS TAINTED BY THE INFAMOUS CONCESSION NEVER TO TOUCH IT
HOW FAR THEY ARE DESERVING OF INTEREST IN THEIR ACTIONS AND IN THE SECRET PURPOSES OF THEIR HEARTS REVEALED IN THE BITTER NECESSITIES OF THE TIME I CONFESS THAT FOR ME THAT TIME IS THE TIME OF FIRM FRIENDSHIPS
SHE TOO AFFECTED NOT TO SEE THE SENOR DECOUD TALKING PUBLICLY WITH ANTONIA IN DEFIANCE OF EVERY CONVENTION AND HE NOT EVEN HER NOVIO AS FAR AS THE WORLD KNEW THOUGH EVEN IN THAT CASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SCANDAL ENOUGH BUT THE DIGNIFIED OLD LADY RESPECTED AND ADMIRED BY THE FIRST FAMILIES
YOU KNOW YOU WERE A VERY TERRIBLE PERSON A SORT OF CHARLOTTE CORDAY IN A SCHOOLGIRL'S DRESS A FEROCIOUS PATRIOT I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD HAVE STUCK A KNIFE INTO GUZMAN BENTO SHE INTERRUPTED HIM YOU DO ME TOO MUCH HONOUR
TO BE TOLD REPEATEDLY THAT ONE'S FUTURE IS BLIGHTED BECAUSE OF THE POSSESSION OF A SILVER MINE IS NOT AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN A MATTER OF PRIME IMPORTANCE AS TO ITS MAIN STATEMENT BUT IN ITS FORM IT IS CALCULATED TO EXCITE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WONDER AND ATTENTION
AND MORAGA HAS MISERABLY MISMANAGED THIS BUSINESS PERHAPS YOUR FATHER DID TOO I DON'T KNOW MONTERO WAS BRIBEABLE WHY I SUPPOSE HE ONLY WANTED HIS SHARE OF THIS FAMOUS LOAN FOR NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHY DIDN'T THE STUPID STA MARTA PEOPLE GIVE HIM A MISSION TO EUROPE OR SOMETHING
AND MISSUS GOULD WITH HER LITTLE HEAD AND SHINING COILS OF HAIR SITTING IN A CLOUD OF MUSLIN AND LACE BEFORE A SLENDER MAHOGANY TABLE RESEMBLED A FAIRY POSED LIGHTLY BEFORE DAINTY PHILTRES DISPENSED OUT OF VESSELS OF SILVER AND PORCELAIN
WHENCE THE CERES WAS TO CARRY THEM OFF INTO THE OLYMPUS OF PLUTOCRATS CAPTAIN MITCHELL HAD SNATCHED AT THE OCCASION OF LEAVE TAKING TO REMARK TO MISSUS GOULD IN A LOW CONFIDENTIAL MUTTER THIS MARKS AN EPOCH
OH BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT PROTESTED MISSUS GOULD ALMOST SHOCKED THE ALLUSION WAS NOT TO THE POINT DON JOSE WAS A DEAR GOOD MAN WHO TALKED VERY WELL AND WAS ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE GREATNESS OF THE SAN TOME MINE
WITH HER UPRIGHT CARRIAGE AND HER WHITE HEAD A RELIC OF THE PAST DISREGARDED BY MEN AWAITING IMPATIENTLY THE DAWNS OF OTHER NEW ERAS THE COMING OF MORE REVOLUTIONS BUT THIS IS THE IDLEST OF DREAMS
HE WOULD NOD PROVISIONALLY AND GO ON TO THE END OF THE ORATORIAL PERIOD ONLY THEN HE WOULD SAY CARLOS MY FRIEND
DON CARLOS GOULD IN HIS ENGLISH CLOTHES LOOKED AS INCONGRUOUS BUT MUCH MORE AT HOME THAN THE KINGLY CAVALIER REINING IN HIS STEED ON THE PEDESTAL ABOVE THE SLEEPING LEPEROS WITH HIS MARBLE ARM RAISED TOWARDS THE MARBLE RIM OF A PLUMED HAT
THAT'S WHY I LONG SOMETIMES FOR ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF THE BEAUTIFUL ANTONIA OR CAN IT BE THE OTHER MOVING IN THE DIMNESS OF THE GREAT CATHEDRAL SAYING A SHORT PRAYER AT THE
AFTER THAT MEETING CHARLES GOULD VISITED NO MINES THOUGH THEY WENT TOGETHER IN A CARRIAGE ONCE TO SEE SOME MARBLE QUARRIES WHERE THE WORK RESEMBLED MINING IN SO FAR THAT IT ALSO WAS THE TEARING OF THE RAW MATERIAL OF TREASURE FROM THE EARTH
FAMED FOR HIS RUTHLESS AND CRUEL TYRANNY READIED HIS APOTHEOSIS IN THE POPULAR LEGEND OF A SANGUINARY LAND HAUNTING SPECTRE WHOSE BODY HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF BY THE DEVIL IN PERSON
THAT'S HOW YOUR MONEY MAKING IS JUSTIFIED HERE IN THE FACE OF LAWLESSNESS AND DISORDER IT IS JUSTIFIED BECAUSE THE SECURITY WHICH IT DEMANDS MUST BE SHARED WITH AN OPPRESSED PEOPLE A BETTER JUSTICE WILL COME AFTERWARDS THAT'S YOUR RAY OF HOPE
THE ENIGMATICAL PATRON OF THE NEW REVOLUTIONARY AGITATION THE TRUSTED THE WEALTHY COMRADE FIDANZA WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS MORAL RUIN LOCKED UP IN HIS BREAST HE REMAINS ESSENTIALLY A MAN
YES BUT IF HE HAD ONLY GRAPPLED WITH IT IN A PROPER WAY AND THEN THEY STOPPED EVERYWHERE THERE WERE LONG SHADOWS LYING ON THE HILLS ON THE ROADS ON THE ENCLOSED FIELDS OF OLIVE TREES
AND THEN THE CARRIAGE STOPPED BEFORE THE DOOR OF THE CASA GOULD THE YOUNG MAN OFFERED HIS HAND TO THE LADIES THEY WENT IN FIRST TOGETHER DON JOSE WALKED BY THE SIDE OF DECOUD AND THE GOUTY OLD PORTER TOTTERED AFTER THEM WITH SOME LIGHT WRAPS ON HIS ARM
YET CALM AND REFLECTIVE HIS PERSONAL FEELINGS HAD NOT BEEN OUTRAGED AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO RESENT WITH PROPER AND DURABLE INDIGNATION THE PHYSICAL OR MENTAL ANGUISH OF ANOTHER ORGANISM EVEN IF THAT OTHER ORGANISM IS ONE'S OWN FATHER
HAD IMPRESSED HIM WITH THE CONVICTION THAT CHARLES GOULD WAS PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF KEEPING UP HIS END
VERY MUCH LIKE NOSTROMO BUT DOMINIC THE CORSICAN NURSED A CERTAIN PRIDE OF ANCESTRY FROM WHICH MY NOSTROMO IS FREE FOR NOSTROMO'S LINEAGE HAD TO BE MORE ANCIENT STILL
ALWAYS THE TRUE ENGLISH ACTIVITY NO WHAT HE DRANK UP ALL THE TEA AT ONCE IN ONE DRAUGHT THIS PERFORMANCE WAS INVARIABLY FOLLOWED BY A SLIGHT SHUDDER AND A LOW INVOLUNTARY BR R R R WHICH WAS NOT COVERED BY THE HASTY EXCLAMATION
THE SQUAT TURRETED SIDES HELD UP BETWEEN THEM A MASS OF MASONRY WITH BUNCHES OF GRASS GROWING AT THE TOP
BUT SHE WAS AN UNCOMPROMISING PURITAN OF PATRIOTISM WITH NO TAINT OF THE SLIGHTEST WORLDLINESS IN HER THOUGHTS I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN LOVE WITH HER BUT IT WAS I WHO HAD TO HEAR OFTENEST HER SCATHING CRITICISM OF MY LEVITIES
WHEN YOU MAKE WAR YOU MAY RETREAT BUT NOT WHEN YOU SPEND YOUR TIME IN INCITING POOR IGNORANT FOOLS TO KILL AND TO DIE HIS TONE REMAINED LIGHT AND AS IF UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE SHE STOOD MOTIONLESS HER HANDS CLASPED LIGHTLY THE FAN HANGING DOWN FROM HER INTERLACED FINGERS
AND THOSE WERE THE LAST WORDS IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT COULD EVER HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ANTONIA HE HAD NEVER MADE IT UP WITH HER SO COMPLETELY IN ALL THEIR INTERCOURSE OF SMALL ENCOUNTERS BUT EVEN BEFORE SHE HAD TIME TO TURN TOWARDS HIM WHICH SHE DID SLOWLY WITH A RIGID GRACE HE HAD BEGUN TO PLEAD
AFTER A LOT OF REVOLUTIONS AND THAT'S YOUR COSTAGUANA IN A NUTSHELL OF COURSE HE WAS TOO GREAT A MAN TO BE QUESTIONED AS TO HIS MOTIVES EVEN BY HIS INTIMATES THE OUTSIDE WORLD WAS AT LIBERTY TO WONDER RESPECTFULLY AT THE HIDDEN MEANING OF HIS ACTIONS
EVEN MISTER GOULD'S LETTERS TO HIS FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY CHARLES THEN AWAY IN ENGLAND FOR HIS EDUCATION CAME AT LAST TO TALK OF PRACTICALLY NOTHING BUT THE MINE HE GROANED OVER THE INJUSTICE THE PERSECUTION
THE PEOPLE RETURNING FROM THE HARBOUR FILLED THE PAVEMENTS THE SHUFFLE OF SANDALS AND A LOW MURMUR OF VOICES ASCENDED TO THE WINDOW NOW AND THEN A COACH ROLLED SLOWLY ALONG THE DISJOINTED ROADWAY OF THE CALLE DE LA CONSTITUCION THERE WERE NOT MANY PRIVATE CARRIAGES IN SULACO
THE OUTRAGE OF THAT MINE HE OCCUPIED WHOLE PAGES IN THE EXPOSITION OF THE FATAL CONSEQUENCES ATTACHING TO THE POSSESSION OF THAT MINE FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW WITH EVERY DISMAL INFERENCE WITH WORDS OF HORROR AT THE APPARENTLY ETERNAL CHARACTER OF THAT CURSE
SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF IMPOSING UPON HIM THIS MARKED SHOW OF DEFERENCE SHE KEPT HER OLD SPANISH HOUSE ONE OF THE FINEST SPECIMENS IN SULACO OPEN FOR THE DISPENSATION OF THE SMALL GRACES OF EXISTENCE
WE ARE IN NOW FOR ALL THAT THERE IS IN US HE BENT OVER HER UPTURNED FACE VERY TENDERLY AND A LITTLE REMORSEFULLY CHARLES GOULD WAS COMPETENT BECAUSE HE HAD NO ILLUSIONS THE GOULD CONCESSION HAD TO FIGHT FOR LIFE WITH SUCH WEAPONS
ALL THIS WAS WRONG UTTERLY WRONG BUT SHE FASCINATED HIM AND SOMETIMES THE SHEER SAGACITY OF A PHRASE WOULD BREAK THE CHARM REPLACE THE FASCINATION BY A SUDDEN UNWILLING THRILL OF INTEREST
BUT AFTERWARDS ANOTHER GOVERNMENT BETHOUGHT ITSELF OF THAT VALUABLE ASSET IT WAS AN ORDINARY COSTAGUANA GOVERNMENT THE FOURTH IN SIX YEARS BUT IT JUDGED OF ITS OPPORTUNITIES SANELY
AS MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY TO THE COURT OF SAINT JAMES HE DID NOT LIKE TEA AND USUALLY ROCKING HIS AMERICAN CHAIR HIS NEAT LITTLE SHINY BOOTS CROSSED ON THE FOOT REST HE WOULD TALK ON AND ON
A ROOM MAGNIFICENT AND NAKED WITH HERE AND THERE A LONG STRIP OF DAMASK BLACK WITH DAMP AND AGE
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN AMAZED AT THE STATE OF HER MIND AS THE SPANISH AMERICAN LADIES HAD BEEN AMAZED AT THE TIRELESS ACTIVITY OF HER BODY SHE WOULD IN HER OWN WORDS HAVE BEEN FOR THEM SOMETHING OF A MONSTER HOWEVER THE GOULDS WERE IN ESSENTIALS A RETICENT COUPLE
HE LOOKED IN HIS ENGLISH CLOTHES AND WITH HIS IMPORTED SADDLERY AS THOUGH HE HAD COME THIS MOMENT TO COSTAGUANA AT HIS EASY SWIFT PASOTROTE STRAIGHT OUT OF SOME GREEN MEADOW AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD HIS WAY WOULD LIE ALONG THE OLD SPANISH ROAD
THE COSTAGUANA MAIL IT WAS NEVER LARGE ONE FAIRLY HEAVY ENVELOPE WAS TAKEN UNOPENED STRAIGHT INTO THE GREAT MAN'S ROOM AND NO INSTRUCTIONS DEALING WITH IT HAD EVER BEEN ISSUED THENCE THE OFFICE WHISPERED THAT HE ANSWERED PERSONALLY AND NOT BY DICTATION EITHER
HER BLUE EYES GLIDED SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM SLIGHTLY UPWARDS MOLLIFIED AND QUESTIONING YOU CAN'T THINK I AM SERIOUS WHEN I CALL MONTERO A GRAN BESTIA EVERY SECOND DAY IN THE PORVENIR THAT IS NOT A SERIOUS OCCUPATION NO OCCUPATION IS SERIOUS NOT EVEN WHEN A BULLET THROUGH THE HEART IS THE PENALTY OF FAILURE
KEEN AND ALIVE ON HIS WELL SHAPED SLATE COLOURED BEAST WITH A WHITE EYE WEAR HIS HEART ON THE SLEEVE OF HIS ENGLISH COAT HIS MIND PRESERVED ITS STEADY POISE AS IF SHELTERED IN THE PASSIONLESS STABILITY OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC DECENCIES AT HOME IN EUROPE
AS THE OLD MAN WHO WROTE THESE PLAINTIVE AND ENRAGED LETTERS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEA
THUS AT LEAST THE PRIESTS EXPLAINED ITS DISAPPEARANCE TO THE BAREFOOTED MULTITUDE THAT STREAMED IN AWESTRUCK TO GAZE AT THE HOLE IN THE SIDE OF THE UGLY BOX OF BRICKS BEFORE THE GREAT ALTAR GUZMAN BENTO OF CRUEL MEMORY
THE OBSCURE ORIGINS OF NOSTROMO THE BOOK FROM THAT MOMENT I SUPPOSE IT HAD TO BE YET EVEN THEN I HESITATED AS IF WARNED BY THE INSTINCT OF SELF PRESERVATION
HE HAD GIVEN A VAST SHAPE TO THE VAGUENESS OF HER UNSELFISH AMBITIONS CHARLEY SHE SAID YOU ARE SPLENDIDLY DISOBEDIENT HE LEFT HER SUDDENLY IN THE CORREDOR TO GO AND GET HIS HAT A SOFT GREY SOMBRERO AN ARTICLE OF NATIONAL COSTUME
HAD BEEN SALUTED BY THE GREAT LIBERATOR AS SAVIOURS OF HIS COUNTRY
THE SENOR ADMINISTRADOR IS JUST BACK FROM THE MOUNTAIN IN THE GREAT SALA WITH ITS GROUPS OF ANCIENT SPANISH AND MODERN EUROPEAN FURNITURE MAKING AS IF DIFFERENT CENTRES UNDER THE HIGH WHITE SPREAD OF THE CEILING THE SILVER AND PORCELAIN OF THE TEA SERVICE GLEAMED AMONG A CLUSTER OF DWARF CHAIRS
THERE WERE STRANGE RUMOURS OF THE ENGLISH DOCTOR YEARS AGO IN THE TIME OF GUZMAN BENTO HE HAD BEEN MIXED UP IT WAS WHISPERED IN A CONSPIRACY WHICH WAS BETRAYED AND AS PEOPLE EXPRESSED IT DROWNED IN BLOOD
IN COURSE OF TIME THE BOY AT FIRST ONLY PUZZLED BY THE ANGRY JEREMIADS BUT RATHER SORRY FOR HIS DAD BEGAN TO TURN THE MATTER OVER IN HIS MIND IN SUCH MOMENTS AS HE COULD SPARE FROM PLAY AND STUDY
HE REMAINED SILENT FOR A MINUTE STARTLED AS IF OVERWHELMED BY A SORT OF AWED HAPPINESS WITH THE LINES OF THE MOCKING SMILE STILL STIFFENED ABOUT HIS MOUTH AND INCREDULOUS SURPRISE IN HIS EYES THE VALUE OF A SENTENCE IS IN THE PERSONALITY WHICH UTTERS IT FOR NOTHING NEW CAN BE SAID BY MAN OR WOMAN
THE PAPERS HAD UNFORTUNATELY TRUMPETED ALL OVER THE LAND HIS JOURNEY TO COSTAGUANA IF HE WAS PLEASED AT THE WAY CHARLES GOULD WAS GOING ON HE INFUSED AN ADDED GRIMNESS INTO HIS ASSURANCES OF SUPPORT
SHE WAS ALWAYS SORRY FOR HOMESICK PEOPLE BORN IN THE COUNTRY AS HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM SPARE AND TALL WITH A FLAMING MOUSTACHE A NEAT CHIN CLEAR BLUE EYES AUBURN HAIR
HE WAS THINKING OF THE ANGRY FACE OF ANTONIA HE WAS CONFIDENT THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIS PEACE WITH HER HE HAD NOT STAYED IN SULACO TO QUARREL WITH ANTONIA MARTIN DECOUD WAS ANGRY WITH HIMSELF ALL HE SAW AND HEARD GOING ON AROUND HIM EXASPERATED
DURING MY ABSENCE MY PRINCIPAL AUTHORITY FOR THE HISTORY OF COSTAGUANA IS OF COURSE MY VENERATED FRIEND THE LATE DON JOSE AVELLANOS MINISTER TO THE COURTS OF ENGLAND AND SPAIN ET CETERA ET CETERA
AND THEY DISCUSSED THAT OPINION LONG AND EARNESTLY AS IF THEY COULD INFLUENCE A MIND ACROSS HALF THE GLOBE BUT IN REALITY THEY DISCUSSED IT BECAUSE THE SENTIMENT OF LOVE CAN ENTER INTO ANY SUBJECT AND LIVE ARDENTLY IN REMOTE PHRASES FOR THIS NATURAL REASON
AND IT WOULD BE SO EASY OF ATTAINMENT HE CONTINUED THIS AIM WHICH WHETHER KNOWINGLY OR NOT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD IN MY HEART EVER SINCE THE DAY WHEN YOU SNUBBED ME SO HORRIBLY ONCE IN PARIS YOU REMEMBER A SLIGHT SMILE SEEMED TO MOVE THE CORNER OF THE LIP THAT WAS ON HIS SIDE
FROM VENTURING ON A DISTANT AND TOILSOME JOURNEY INTO A LAND FULL OF INTRIGUES AND REVOLUTIONS BUT IT HAD TO BE DONE IT TOOK THE BEST PART OF THE YEARS NINETEEN O THREE FOUR TO DO
IT HAS KILLED HIM HE SAID HE HAD WALKED STRAIGHT OUT OF TOWN WITH THE NEWS STRAIGHT OUT BEFORE HIM IN THE NOONDAY SUN ON THE WHITE ROAD AND HIS FEET HAD BROUGHT HIM FACE TO FACE WITH HER IN THE HALL OF THE RUINED PALAZZO
MY DEAR IT'S NOTHING TO ME INTERRUPTED HER HUSBAND IN A REASONABLE TONE I MAKE USE OF WHAT I SEE WHAT'S IT TO ME WHETHER HIS TALK IS THE VOICE OF DESTINY OR SIMPLY A BIT OF CLAP TRAP ELOQUENCE
AT HIS WORST PEOPLE FEARED THE OPEN SCORNFULNESS OF HIS TONGUE ONLY MISSUS GOULD COULD KEEP HIS UNBELIEF IN MEN'S MOTIVES WITHIN DUE BOUNDS BUT EVEN TO HER ON AN OCCASION NOT CONNECTED WITH NOSTROMO AND IN A TONE WHICH FOR HIM WAS GENTLE
THEIR DESOLATION APPEALED TO HIM LIKE THE SIGHT OF HUMAN MISERY WHOSE CAUSES ARE VARIED AND PROFOUND THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORTHLESS BUT ALSO THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD HIS FUTURE WIFE WAS THE FIRST
NOT TO RAISE HER ABOVE IT THE TENDERNESS AND INDULGENCE OF HER PARENTS AND THE EXEMPTION FROM ALL ORDINARY OCCUPATIONS HAD FOSTERED A NATURAL GRACE AND DELICACY OF CHARACTER
INTO WHOSE BOSOM SHE MIGHT SOON BE GATHERED SUDDENLY THE CLANG OF HOOFS WAS HEARD A HORSEMAN GALLOPED TO THE COTTAGE HE DISMOUNTED BEFORE THE WINDOW
HIS IMPLEMENTS FOR ANGLING WERE CAREFULLY DISPOSED ON NAILS AND HOOKS ABOUT THE ROOM ON A SHELF WAS ARRANGED HIS LIBRARY CONTAINING A WORK ON ANGLING MUCH WORN A BIBLE COVERED WITH CANVAS AN ODD VOLUME OR TWO OF VOYAGES
A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE STREAM WHICH FLOWS DOWN FROM THE WELSH HILLS AND THROWS ITSELF INTO THE DEE MY ATTENTION WAS ATTRACTED TO A GROUP SEATED ON THE MARGIN ON APPROACHING I FOUND IT TO CONSIST
THE POOR GIRL GAVE A FAINT EXCLAMATION AND SUNK BACK IN HER CHAIR IT WAS HER REPENTANT LOVER HE RUSHED INTO THE HOUSE AND FLEW TO CLASP HER TO HIS BOSOM
HE PASSED AWAY LIKE A BRIGHT VISION FROM HER SIGHT AND LEFT HER ALL IN DARKNESS IT WOULD BE TRITE TO DWELL ON THE PARTICULARS OF HER AFTER STORY
A PATENT ROD A LANDING NET AND A SCORE OF OTHER INCONVENIENCES ONLY TO BE FOUND IN THE TRUE ANGLER'S ARMORY THUS HARNESSED FOR THE FIELD HE WAS AS GREAT A MATTER OF STARE AND WONDERMENT AMONG THE COUNTRY FOLK
THE GOOD MAN WATCHED OVER HER EDUCATION WITH PATERNAL CARE IT WAS LIMITED AND SUITABLE TO THE SPHERE IN WHICH SHE WAS TO MOVE FOR HE ONLY SOUGHT TO MAKE HER AN ORNAMENT TO HER STATION IN LIFE
HIS FACE BORE THE MARKS OF FORMER STORMS BUT PRESENT FAIR WEATHER ITS FURROWS HAD BEEN WORN INTO AN HABITUAL SMILE HIS IRON GRAY LOCKS HUNG ABOUT HIS EARS
AND THE SPECIES CONTINUE TO FLOURISH THUS ALSO DO AUTHORS BEGET AUTHORS AND HAVING PRODUCED A NUMEROUS PROGENY IN A GOOD OLD AGE THEY SLEEP WITH THEIR FATHERS THAT IS TO SAY WITH THE AUTHORS WHO PRECEDED THEM AND FROM WHOM THEY HAD STOLEN
OR A FANTASTICALLY CARVED ORNAMENT PEERED THROUGH THE VERDANT COVERING IT WAS A LOVELY EVENING THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY HAD BEEN DARK AND SHOWERY BUT
THERE WERE THE OLD OBSTACLES WHICH SO INCESSANTLY OCCUR IN THESE HEEDLESS ATTACHMENTS HIS RANK IN LIFE THE PREJUDICES OF TITLED CONNECTIONS
STILL HOWEVER MY IMAGINATION CONTINUED BUSY AND INDEED THE SAME SCENE CONTINUED BEFORE MY MIND'S EYE ONLY A LITTLE CHANGED IN SOME OF THE DETAILS I DREAMT THAT THE CHAMBER WAS STILL DECORATED WITH THE PORTRAITS OF ANCIENT AUTHORS BUT THAT THE NUMBER WAS INCREASED
THE BELL HAD TOLLED FOR THE EVENING SERVICE THE LAST VILLAGER WAS LAGGING INTO THE PORCH AND EVERYTHING HAD SUNK INTO THAT HALLOWED STILLNESS PECULIAR TO THE DAY OF REST
AND WAS A PRIVILEGED VISITOR TO THEIR KITCHENS THE WHOLE TENOR OF HIS LIFE WAS QUIET AND INOFFENSIVE BEING PRINCIPALLY PASSED ABOUT THE NEIGHBORING STREAMS WHEN THE WEATHER AND SEASON WERE FAVORABLE AND AT OTHER TIMES HE EMPLOYED HIMSELF AT HOME
AND DOWNCAST LOOK OF MUTE DELIGHT AND HER CHEEK WOULD MANTLE WITH ENTHUSIASM OR IF EVER SHE VENTURED A SHY GLANCE OF TIMID ADMIRATION IT WAS AS QUICKLY WITHDRAWN
A HAMMOCK WAS SLUNG FROM THE CEILING WHICH IN THE DAYTIME WAS LASHED UP SO AS TO TAKE BUT LITTLE ROOM FROM THE CENTRE OF THE CHAMBER HUNG A MODEL OF A SHIP OF HIS OWN WORKMANSHIP TWO OR THREE CHAIRS A TABLE AND A LARGE SEA CHEST FORMED THE PRINCIPAL MOVABLES
IT WOUND SLOWLY ALONG A LANE WAS LOST AND REAPPEARED THROUGH THE BREAKS OF THE HEDGES UNTIL IT PASSED THE PLACE WHERE I WAS SITTING THE PALL WAS SUPPORTED BY YOUNG GIRLS DRESSED IN WHITE
SHE WAS TOO FAINT TO RISE SHE ATTEMPTED TO EXTEND HER TREMBLING HAND HER LIPS MOVED AS IF SHE SPOKE
AND HAVE BEEN CALLED UP BY AN AGREEABLE SCENE WHICH I WITNESSED NOT LONG SINCE
AND THERE WAS A CHEERFUL CONTENTEDNESS IN HIS LOOKS THAT QUITE DREW ME TOWARDS HIM I COULD NOT BUT REMARK THE GALLANT MANNER IN WHICH HE STUMPED FROM ONE PART OF THE BROOK TO ANOTHER WAVING HIS ROD IN THE AIR TO KEEP THE LINE FROM DRAGGING ON THE GROUND OR CATCHING AMONG THE BUSHES AND THE ADROITNESS
WOULD OFTEN ATTRACT THE NOTICE OF CASUAL VISITORS AMONG THESE ON ONE MAY DAY WAS A YOUNG OFFICER WHOSE REGIMENT HAD BEEN RECENTLY QUARTERED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THE ARRAY OF ARMIES AND EVEN THE DIN OF BATTLES HIS THOUGHTS WOULD SOMETIMES STEAL BACK TO THE SCENES OF RURAL QUIET AND VILLAGE SIMPLICITY THE WHITE COTTAGE
SOME TOO SEEMED TO CONTEMPLATE THE COSTUMES OF THE OLD WRITERS MERELY TO IMBIBE THEIR PRINCIPLES OF TASTE AND TO CATCH THEIR AIR AND SPIRIT BUT I GRIEVE TO SAY THAT TOO MANY WERE APT TO ARRAY THEMSELVES FROM TOP TO TOE IN THE PATCHWORK MANNER I HAVE MENTIONED
AND THE QUIET WATCHFULNESS OF THE SPORT GRADUALLY BRING ON PLEASANT FITS OF MUSING WHICH ARE NOW AND THEN AGREEABLY INTERRUPTED BY THE SONG OF A BIRD THE DISTANT WHISTLE OF THE PEASANT OR PERHAPS THE VAGARY OF SOME FISH LEAPING OUT OF THE STILL WATER
BUT THE MOTHER ONLY THOUGHT OF HER CHILD AS A FLOWER OF THE FIELD CUT DOWN AND WITHERED IN THE MIDST OF ITS SWEETNESS
THE FOOTPATH ALONG THE SILVER BROOK AND UP THE HAWTHORN HEDGE AND THE LITTLE VILLAGE MAID LOITERING ALONG IT LEANING ON HIS ARM
THAT IN GOING ABOUT YOUR DISPORTES YE OPEN NO MAN'S GATES BUT THAT YE SHET THEM AGAIN ALSO YE SHALL NOT USE THIS FORSAYD CRAFTI DISPORT FOR NO COVETOUSNESS TO THE ENCREASING AND SPARING OF YOUR MONEY ONLY BUT PRINCIPALLY FOR YOUR SOLACE
IN A REMOTE AND DISTANT TRACT OF TIME MANY OF THEIR WORKS ALSO UNDERGO A KIND OF METEMPSYCHOSIS
THOUGH I FEAR I SHALL NEVER BE ADROIT IN THE PRACTICE OF HIS ART
UNHEEDED BEAUTIES ENOUGH TO FILL THE SKETCH BOOK OF A HUNTER OF THE PICTURESQUE SOMETIMES IT WOULD LEAP DOWN ROCKY SHELVES MAKING SMALL CASCADES OVER WHICH THE TREES THREW THEIR BROAD BALANCING SPRAYS AND LONG NAMELESS WEEDS
IT WAS HER ENJOYMENT TO SIT ALL DAY AND LOOK OUT UPON THE LANDSCAPE STILL SHE UTTERED NO COMPLAINT NOR IMPARTED TO ANY ONE THE MALADY THAT WAS PREYING ON HER HEART
I OBSERVED HIM NOW AND THEN DRAW A LARGE FRAGMENT OF BISCUIT OUT OF HIS POCKET AND GNAW WHETHER IT WAS HIS DINNER OR WHETHER HE WAS ENDEAVORING TO KEEP OFF THAT EXHAUSTION OF THE STOMACH PRODUCED BY MUCH PONDERING OVER DRY WORKS
THESE INDEED HAD BEEN PROMOTED BY ITS PRESENT PASTOR WHO WAS A LOVER OF OLD CUSTOMS AND ONE OF THOSE SIMPLE CHRISTIANS THAT THINK THEIR MISSION FULFILLED BY PROMOTING JOY ON EARTH
MIGHT AT FIRST HAVE CHARMED HER EYE BUT IT WAS NOT THESE THAT HAD CAPTIVATED HER HEART HER ATTACHMENT HAD SOMETHING IN IT OF IDOLATRY
MOURNING OVER HER CHILDREN AND WOULD NOT BE COMFORTED ON RETURNING TO THE INN I LEARNT THE WHOLE STORY OF THE DECEASED IT WAS A SIMPLE ONE
WHOM I OBSERVED OGLING SEVERAL MOULDY POLEMICAL WRITERS THROUGH AN EYEGLASS HE SOON CONTRIVED TO SLIP ON THE VOLUMINOUS MANTLE OF ONE OF THE OLD FATHERS AND HAVING PURLOINED THE GRAY BEARD OF ANOTHER ENDEAVORED TO LOOK EXCEEDINGLY WISE
THE COUNTRY AROUND WAS OF THAT PASTORAL KIND WHICH WALTON IS FOND OF DESCRIBING IT WAS A PART OF THE GREAT PLAIN OF CHESHIRE CLOSE BY THE BEAUTIFUL VALE OF GESSFORD
SHE SCARCELY INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE GROWING PASSION THAT WAS ABSORBING EVERY THOUGHT AND FEELING OR WHAT WERE TO BE ITS CONSEQUENCES SHE INDEED
SHE EVEN DEPICTED THE SUFFERINGS WHICH SHE HAD EXPERIENCED BUT CONCLUDED WITH SAYING THAT SHE COULD NOT DIE IN PEACE UNTIL SHE HAD SENT HIM HER FORGIVENESS
PRINTED IN BLACK LETTER HE WAS EVIDENTLY CONSTRUCTING SOME WORK OF PROFOUND ERUDITION THAT WOULD BE PURCHASED BY EVERY MAN WHO WISHED TO BE THOUGHT LEARNED PLACED UPON A CONSPICUOUS SHELF OF HIS LIBRARY OR LAID OPEN UPON HIS TABLE BUT NEVER READ
BUT TOUCHING FROM ITS VERY SIMPLICITY SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS DYING AND DID NOT CONCEAL FROM HIM THAT HIS CONDUCT WAS THE CAUSE
IT WAS LIKE OTHER TALES OF LOVE MELANCHOLY SHE AVOIDED SOCIETY AND WANDERED OUT ALONE IN THE WALKS SHE HAD MOST FREQUENTED WITH HER LOVER
HER POOR PARENTS HUNG IN MUTE ANXIETY OVER THIS FADING BLOSSOM OF THEIR HOPES STILL FLATTERING THEMSELVES THAT IT MIGHT AGAIN REVIVE TO FRESHNESS AND THAT THE BRIGHT UNEARTHLY BLOOM WHICH SOMETIMES FLUSHED HER CHEEK
FOR WHO DOES NOT LIKE NOW AND THEN TO PLAY THE SAGE HE HAD BEEN MUCH OF A RAMBLER IN HIS DAY AND HAD PASSED SOME YEARS OF HIS YOUTH IN AMERICA PARTICULARLY IN SAVANNAH
WHICH HE HAD JUST KILLED TO DISCOVER BY ITS CONTENTS WHAT INSECTS WERE SEASONABLE FOR BAIT AND WAS LECTURING ON THE SUBJECT TO HIS COMPANIONS WHO APPEARED TO LISTEN WITH INFINITE DEFERENCE I HAVE A KIND FEELING TOWARDS ALL
SHE WAS STILL SURROUNDED BY THAT MYSTERIOUS BUT IMPASSIVE CHARM OF VIRGIN PURITY IN WHOSE HALLOWED SPHERE NO GUILTY THOUGHT CAN LIVE
MAY IT NOT BE THE WAY IN WHICH PROVIDENCE HAS TAKEN CARE THAT THE SEEDS OF KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM SHALL BE PRESERVED FROM AGE TO AGE IN SPITE OF THE INEVITABLE DECAY OF THE WORKS IN WHICH THEY WERE FIRST PRODUCED
BUT THE SMIRKING COMMONPLACE OF HIS COUNTENANCE SET AT NAUGHT ALL THE TRAPPINGS OF WISDOM ONE SICKLY LOOKING GENTLEMAN WAS BUSIED EMBROIDERING A VERY FLIMSY GARMENT WITH GOLD THREAD DRAWN OUT OF SEVERAL OLD COURT DRESSES OF THE REIGN OF QUEEN ELIZABETH
I HAVE THEM AT THIS MOMENT BEFORE EYES STEALING ALONG THE BORDER OF THE BROOK WHERE IT LAY OPEN TO THE DAY OR WAS MERELY FRINGED BY SHRUBS AND BUSHES I SEE THE BITTERN RISING WITH HOLLOW SCREAM AS THEY BREAK IN UPON HIS RARELY INVADED HAUNT
IT IS DELIGHTFUL TO SAUNTER ALONG THOSE LIMPID STREAMS WHICH WANDER LIKE VEINS OF SILVER THROUGH THE BOSOM OF THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY LEADING ONE THROUGH A DIVERSITY OF SMALL HOME SCENERY SOMETIMES WINDING THROUGH ORNAMENTED GROUNDS
AND HE SEEMED TO HAVE IMBIBED ALL HIS SIMPLE FRANKNESS AND PREVALENT GOOD HUMOR THOUGH HE HAD BEEN SORELY BUFFETED ABOUT THE WORLD HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THE WORLD IN ITSELF WAS GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL THOUGH HE HAD BEEN AS ROUGHLY USED IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AS A POOR SHEEP THAT IS FLEECED BY EVERY HEDGE AND THICKET
IN WHICH ARE SET FORTH MANY OF THE MAXIMS OF THEIR INOFFENSIVE FRATERNITY TAKE GOOD HEDE SAYETH THIS
I WAS GRIEVED TO SEE MANY MEN TO WHOM I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO LOOK UP WITH AWE AND REVERENCE FAIN TO STEAL OFF WITH SCARCE A RAG TO COVER THEIR NAKEDNESS JUST THEN MY EYE WAS CAUGHT BY THE PRAGMATICAL OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE GREEK GRIZZLED WIG
AND SHE WOULD SIGH AND BLUSH AT THE IDEA OF HER COMPARATIVE UNWORTHINESS HER LOVER WAS EQUALLY IMPASSIONED BUT HIS PASSION WAS MINGLED WITH FEELINGS OF A COARSER NATURE
IT WAS AN OBJECT OF SOME CURIOSITY ITS OLD TOWER BEING COMPLETELY OVERRUN WITH IVY SO THAT ONLY HERE AND THERE A JUTTING BUTTRESS AN ANGLE OF GRAY WALL
WHO WAS SCRAMBLING AWAY IN SORE AFFRIGHT WITH HALF A SCORE OF AUTHORS IN FULL CRY AFTER HIM THEY WERE CLOSE UPON HIS HAUNCHES IN A TWINKLING OFF WENT HIS WIG AT EVERY TURN SOME STRIP OF RAIMENT WAS PEELED AWAY UNTIL IN A FEW MOMENTS FROM HIS DOMINEERING POMP
SHE DID NOT BREAK FORTH INTO REPROACH SHE SAID NOT A WORD BUT SHE SHRUNK BACK AGHAST AS FROM A VIPER GAVE HIM A LOOK OF ANGUISH THAT PIERCED TO HIS VERY SOUL AND
AND THE HUMBLE ROOF OF HER PARENTS WHEN AT LAST THE NATURE OF HIS PROPOSAL FLASHED UPON HER PURE MIND THE EFFECT WAS WITHERING SHE DID NOT WEEP
AND LIT UP ALL NATURE INTO A MELANCHOLY SMILE IT SEEMED LIKE THE PARTING HOUR OF A GOOD CHRISTIAN SMILING ON THE SINS AND SORROWS OF THE WORLD AND GIVING
WHAT CAN BE MORE AFFECTING AT THAT SIMPLE BUT MOST SOLEMN CONSIGNMENT OF THE BODY TO THE GRAVE EARTH TO EARTH ASHES TO ASHES DUST TO DUST
HE REMAINED FOR A SHORT TIME IN A STATE OF THE MOST PAINFUL IRRESOLUTION HE HESITATED TO COMMUNICATE THE TIDINGS UNTIL THE DAY FOR MARCHING WAS AT HAND
SATISFIED THAT IT WAS HIS FASCINATING VEIN OF HONEST SIMPLICITY AND RURAL FEELING THAT HAD BEWITCHED ME AND NOT THE PASSION FOR ANGLING MY COMPANIONS HOWEVER WERE MORE PERSEVERING IN THEIR DELUSION
AND WAS MUSING AS ONE IS APT TO DO AT THIS SOBER THOUGHTED HOUR ON PAST SCENES AND EARLY FRIENDS ON THOSE WHO WERE DISTANT AND THOSE WHO WERE DEAD
WHICH STILL RETAIN SOME VESTIGES OF OLD ENGLISH CUSTOMS IT HAD ITS RURAL FESTIVALS AND HOLIDAY PASTIMES AND STILL KEPT UP SOME FAINT OBSERVANCE OF THE ONCE POPULAR RITES OF MAY
BUT AS SOON AS THE WEATHER WAS AUSPICIOUS AND THAT THE SPRING BEGAN TO MELT INTO THE VERGE OF SUMMER WE TOOK ROD IN HAND AND SALLIED INTO THE COUNTRY AS STARK MAD AS WAS EVER DON QUIXOTE FROM READING BOOKS OF CHIVALRY
PERHAPS THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A PASSION BETWEEN THE SEXES MORE PURE THAN THIS INNOCENT GIRL'S THE GALLANT FIGURE OF HER YOUTHFUL ADMIRER AND THE SPLENDOR OF HIS MILITARY ATTIRE
WHEN HE GAVE HER THE INTELLIGENCE IN THE COURSE OF AN EVENING RAMBLE THE IDEA OF PARTING HAD NEVER BEFORE OCCURRED TO HER IT BROKE IN AT ONCE UPON HER DREAM OF FELICITY
WE SEE THAT NATURE HAS WISELY THOUGH WHIMSICALLY PROVIDED FOR THE CONVEYANCE OF SEEDS FROM CLIME TO CLIME IN THE MAWS OF CERTAIN BIRDS SO THAT ANIMALS WHICH IN THEMSELVES ARE LITTLE BETTER THAN CARRION AND APPARENTLY THE LAWLESS PLUNDERERS OF THE ORCHARD AND THE CORN FIELD
A FEW WORDS WERE SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE I FOUND THAT THESE MYSTERIOUS PERSONAGES WHOM I HAD MISTAKEN FOR MAGI WERE PRINCIPALLY AUTHORS AND WERE IN THE VERY ACT OF MANUFACTURING BOOKS I WAS IN FACT IN THE READING ROOM OF THE GREAT BRITISH LIBRARY
WITH WHICH ONE IS APT TO SAUNTER ABOUT A MUSEUM IN WARM WEATHER SOMETIMES LOLLING OVER THE GLASS CASES OF MINERALS SOMETIMES STUDYING THE HIEROGLYPHICS ON AN EGYPTIAN MUMMY AND SOME TIMES TRYING WITH NEARLY EQUAL SUCCESS
JUST BY A SPRING OF PURE SWEET WATER THAT STOLE OUT OF THE SIDE OF A HILL
AND PAID HIS COURT TO HER IN THAT UNTHINKING WAY IN WHICH YOUNG OFFICERS ARE TOO APT TO TRIFLE WITH RUSTIC SIMPLICITY THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS ADVANCES TO STARTLE OR ALARM
BEING ATTIRED CAP A PIE FOR THE ENTERPRISE HE WORE A BROAD SKIRTED FUSTIAN COAT PERPLEXED WITH HALF A HUNDRED POCKETS A PAIR OF STOUT SHOES AND LEATHERN GAITERS A BASKET SLUNG ON ONE SIDE FOR FISH
A MOST UNFORTUNATE PLACE FOR THE EXECUTION OF THOSE PISCATORY TACTICS WHICH HAD BEEN INVENTED ALONG THE VELVET MARGINS OF QUIET ENGLISH RIVULETS IT WAS ONE OF THOSE WILD STREAMS THAT LAVISH AMONG OUR ROMANTIC SOLITUDES
HE SHRUNK INTO A LITTLE PURSY CHOPP'D BALD SHOT AND MADE HIS EXIT WITH ONLY A FEW TAGS AND RAGS FLUTTERING AT HIS BACK
WOULD STEAL FORTH INTO OPEN DAY WITH THE MOST PLACID DEMURE FACE IMAGINABLE AS I HAVE SEEN SOME PESTILENT SHREW OF A HOUSEWIFE AFTER FILLING HER HOME WITH UPROAR AND ILL HUMOR COME DIMPLING OUT OF DOORS SWIMMING AND CURTSEYING AND SMILING UPON ALL THE WORLD
BUT NO WORD WAS ARTICULATED SHE LOOKED DOWN UPON HIM
BUT THEY INTERESTED ME STRONGLY AT THE TIME AND TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE AFFECTING CEREMONY WHICH I HAD JUST WITNESSED LEFT A DEEPER IMPRESSION ON MY MIND
HE WAS VERY COMMUNICATIVE HAVING ALL THE EASY GARRULITY
AND CLOSED HER EYES FOREVER SUCH ARE THE PARTICULARS WHICH I GATHERED OF THIS VILLAGE STORY THEY ARE BUT SCANTY
AND THE SIGHT OF BEAUTY APPARENTLY YIELDING IN HIS ARMS THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS POWER OVER HER AND THE DREAD OF LOSING HER FOREVER ALL CONSPIRED TO OVERWHELM HIS BETTER FEELINGS
IN THE BOSOM OF A MOUNTAIN WHICH OPENED ONLY ONCE A YEAR WHERE HE MADE THE SPIRITS OF THE PLACE BRING HIM BOOKS OF ALL KINDS OF DARK KNOWLEDGE SO THAT AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN THE MAGIC PORTAL ONCE MORE SWUNG OPEN ON ITS HINGES HE ISSUED FORTH SO VERSED IN FORBIDDEN LORE
AND DEVOTED THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE TO THE NOBLE ART OF ANGLING
CONTRACTED BROW AND DEEPLY FURROWED FACE SHOWED THE STRUGGLE THAT WAS PASSING WITHIN HIS WIFE HUNG ON HIS ARM AND WEPT ALOUD WITH THE CONVULSIVE BURSTS OF A MOTHER'S SORROW
IT WAS DEEMED ADVISABLE TO PUSH FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ACCORDINGLY THE NEXT DAY
AND IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES A DISH WAS READY WHICH HE SERVED UP TO HIS COMPANIONS BY THE TEMPTING NAME OF GUANACO CUTLETS NO ONE STOOD ON CEREMONY BUT FELL TO WITH A HEARTY GOOD WILL
HIS EYES SLOWLY OPENED AND THEN CLOSED AGAIN PAINED BY THE GLARE OF LIGHT BUT LADY HELENA TOOK HIS HAND AND HE JUMPED UP AT ONCE AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM IN BEWILDERMENT AT THE SIGHT OF SO MANY STRANGERS
THIS WIND BEING THE SIMOOM OF THE PAMPAS THERE WAS A BRIEF INTERRUPTION THIS DAY TO THE MONOTONY OF THE JOURNEY MULRADY WHO WAS IN FRONT OF THE OTHERS RODE HASTILY BACK TO REPORT THE APPROACH OF A TROOP OF INDIANS
BUT THE TRAVELERS COULD NOT FALL BACK ON THIS RESOURCE NOT HAVING THE NECESSARY IMPLEMENTS
THAT IS REGULAR HOWLING LET US GO OUT AND SEE SAID GLENARVAN YES AND BE READY FOR HUNTING REPLIED MC NABBS ARMING HIMSELF WITH HIS CARBINE
THESE PEALS OF LAUGHTER WERE QUITE INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO HIM YOU SEE SAID MAJOR MC NABBS LAUGHING I WAS RIGHT THE PUPIL COULD ENLIGHTEN YOU AFTER ALL MOST ASSUREDLY FRIEND MAJOR REPLIED THE GEOGRAPHER
I UNDERSTAND IT AND SPEAK IT REPLIED THE CHILD IN FLUENT ENOUGH ENGLISH BUT WITH A MARKED ACCENT HIS PRONUNCIATION WAS LIKE A FRENCHMAN'S WHAT IS YOUR NAME ASKED LADY HELENA TOLINE REPLIED THE LITTLE NATIVE
I FEEL AS IF I SHOULD ENJOY MUNCHING THE LITTLE BONES HORRID BUT I WONDER IS IT SO VERY NICE SAID ROBERT MY SECOND TALE WILL ANSWER YOU MY BOY SAID PAGANEL
FOR HE WAS ACTUALLY EXPLODING WITH MIRTH AND HE WENT FULLY A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM THE ENCAMPMENT BEFORE HIS EQUILIBRIUM WAS RESTORED MEANWHILE GLENARVAN LOOKED UP A GEOGRAPHY THEY HAD BROUGHT AMONG THEIR BOOKS IT WAS RICHARDSON'S COMPENDIUM
YOU LOVE HIM VERY MUCH ROBERT YES MY LORD DEARLY
AND THEY HAD MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS WHEN NIGHT CAME AND INTERRUPTED THEM TOWARD EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING AFTER SUPPER WHILE LADY HELENA AND MARY GRANT SLEPT IN THEIR BERTHS PAGANEL AND HIS FRIENDS CONVERSED ON SERIOUS MATTERS AS THEY WALKED UP AND DOWN THE DECK
NEITHER MULRADY NOR WILSON NOR MYSELF WOULD BE ABLE TO REJOIN THALCAVE AT THE GIVEN RENDEZVOUS BUT WE WILL PUT OURSELVES UNDER THE BANNER OF THE BRAVE JACQUES PAGANEL WITH PERFECT CONFIDENCE I RESIGN MYSELF SAID THE GEOGRAPHER MUCH FLATTERED AT HAVING SUPREME COMMAND
BRAVO ROBERT SAID GLENARVAN THALCAVE IS EVIDENTLY CONGRATULATING YOU MY BOY AND PAYING YOU COMPLIMENTS
THAT CAPTAIN GRANT MUST HAVE BEEN DRAGGED RIGHT OVER THE ANDES INTO THE PAMPAS AND THAT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO SEARCH FOR HIM ELSEWHERE
AND TRIED TO BROWSE ON THE MARINE PLANTS AND DRY REEDS THEY FOUND THERE NAUSEOUS TO THE TASTE AS THEY MUST HAVE BEEN AS SOON AS THE WHOLE PARTY WERE ENSCONCED IN THE ROUKAH
WHICH ACCORDING TO THE THERMOMETER WAS TEN DEGREES BELOW ZERO BESIDES THERE WAS A SORT OF FIREPLACE IN IT WITH A CHIMNEY OF BRICKS BADLY ENOUGH PUT TOGETHER CERTAINLY BUT STILL IT ALLOWED OF A FIRE BEING LIGHTED
THEY GO TO BARTER THEIR FEW ARTICLES OF INDUSTRY HUNTING AND FISHING IMPLEMENTS WEAPONS ET CETERA
I AM GOING TO SNATCH MY BROTHERS FROM MISERY AND IGNORANCE I AM GOING TO TEACH THEM
UNDERSTOOD THE CATAPEZ AS HE WAS CALLED IN CHILIAN HAD TWO NATIVES CALLED PEONS AND A BOY ABOUT TWELVE YEARS OF AGE UNDER HIM THE PEONS TOOK CARE OF THE BAGGAGE MULES AND THE BOY LED THE MADRINA
SAVE THE FANTASTIC SILHOUETTE OF SOME TOWERING ROCKS HERE AND THERE THE HOWLS AND CLEARLY THE HOWLS OF TERRIFIED ANIMALS WERE REDOUBLED THEY PROCEEDED FROM THAT PART OF THE CORDILLERAS WHICH LAY IN DARKNESS
ASKING AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS THE CATAPEZ MOREOVER WAS A TACITURN MAN NATURALLY AND HAD NOT BEEN RENDERED
A POOR BURNT UP SORT OF LUCERNE THAT GREW THERE GLENARVAN BEGAN TO BE UNEASY TOKENS OF STERILITY WERE NOT THE LEAST ON THE DECREASE
STONE STAIR LED UP TO THE DOOR THE ONLY OPENING AND NARROW AS THIS DOOR WAS THE HURRICANE AND SNOW
THAT BELONGS TO THE ENGLISH TOO WELL I'LL NOT BE THE ONE TO DISPUTE THAT POINT BUT TOLINE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR OPINION OF EUROPE OR RATHER YOUR PROFESSOR'S EUROPE SAID TOLINE
ARE ALSO BELONGING TO THE ENGLISH VERY GOOD AND NEW CALEDONIA THE SANDWICH ISLANDS THE MENDANA
AS IF WITH THE KEEN EDGE OF AN IMMENSE SCYTHE EVERY PROJECTION OF THE DECLIVITY HOW LONG THIS INDESCRIBABLE DESCENT WOULD LAST NO ONE COULD CALCULATE NOR WHAT IT WOULD END IN ULTIMATELY
THE NATIVE TROOPS ORGANIZED BY LORD GLENARVAN CONSISTED OF THREE MEN AND A BOY THE CAPTAIN OF THE MULETEERS WAS AN ENGLISHMAN
THE SUPPER WAS NOT VERY REVIVING WITHOUT DRINK OF ANY KIND
AND NONE OF THALCAVE'S COMPANIONS HAD MUCH SOLICITUDE ON THAT SCORE ACCORDINGLY THEY TOOK POSSESSION AT ONCE AND STRETCHED THEMSELVES AT FULL LENGTH ON THE GROUND IN THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE TO DRY THEIR DRIPPING GARMENTS WELL NOW WE'VE SECURED A LODGING WE MUST THINK OF SUPPER SAID GLENARVAN
BUT ALL HE CARED ABOUT WAS TO FIND OUT HOW IT HAPPENED THAT THE FLESH OF THE GUANACO WHICH WAS CERTAINLY GOOD AND EATABLE FOOD HAD TURNED OUT SO BADLY IN HIS HANDS AT LAST LIGHT BROKE IN ON HIM AND HE CALLED OUT
OUR FRIENDS MUST NOT HAVE REASON TO COMPLAIN OF THE COURIERS THEY SENT TO PRECEDE THEM AND IF I AM NOT MUCH MISTAKEN THEY WILL BE VERY SATISFIED IT STRIKES ME THAT AN HOUR'S SHOOTING WON'T BE LOST TIME ARE YOU READY ROBERT YES MY LORD REPLIED THE BOY STANDING UP GUN IN HAND
UNDER THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH WHEN SHAKESPEARE WAS DREAMING OUT HIS SHY LOCK A SCOTCH BANDIT SAWNEY BEAN WAS EXECUTED FOR THE CRIME OF CANNIBALISM WAS IT RELIGION THAT PROMPTED HIM TO CANNIBALISM NO IT WAS HUNGER
SOON CURED THE ANIMAL'S OBSTINACY IF A STRAP GOT LOOSE OR A REIN FELL A PEON CAME FORWARD INSTANTLY AND THROWING OFF HIS PONCHO
LIKE A SMALL CAMEL WITHOUT A HUMP THE HEAD WAS SMALL AND THE BODY FLATTENED THE LEGS WERE LONG AND SLENDER THE SKIN FINE AND THE HAIR THE COLOR OF CAFE AU LAIT PAGANEL HAD SCARCELY LOOKED AT IT BEFORE HE EXCLAIMED A GUANACO
THEN HIS PRESENTIMENTS RETURNED IN GREATER STRENGTH THAN BEFORE AND HE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY TO THE SOUNDS OUTSIDE THE HUT AT CERTAIN INTERVALS HE FANCIED HE COULD HEAR RUMBLING NOISES IN THE DISTANCE DULL AND THREATENING LIKE THE MUTTER INGS
THAT IS TO SAY IF THALCAVE LEAVES ANY FOR THEM BUT COULDN'T WE GO TO MEET THEM IT WOULD SPARE THEM SEVERAL HOURS SUFFERING AND ANXIETY YOU'RE RIGHT MY BOY BUT HOW COULD WE CARRY THEM THIS WATER THE LEATHER BOTTLES WERE LEFT WITH WILSON NO IT IS BETTER FOR US TO WAIT FOR THEM AS WE AGREED
ASK THE CATAPEZ WAS SURE TO BE ANSWERED BY THE LEARNED FRENCHMAN BEFORE HE COULD REPLY TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF THE GUIDE WHO GAZED AT HIM IN BEWILDERMENT ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK THAT SAME DAY THEY CAME TO A CROSS ROAD AND NATURALLY ENOUGH
BUT IT WAS SOON EVIDENT THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAOUKA THE WEARIED ANIMALS COULD NOT GO QUICKER THAN A WALKING PACE AT NOON THEY WERE OBLIGED TO LET THEM REST FOR AN HOUR
THERE IS ONLY ONE THING I COULD FANCY AND NOBODY HERE COULD GET IT FOR ME WHAT IS IT ASKED THE JESUIT
SUDDENLY A FURIOUS AVALANCHE CAME DOWN AN AVALANCHE OF LIVING ANIMALS MAD WITH FEAR THE WHOLE PLATEAU SEEMED TO TREMBLE THERE WERE HUNDREDS PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF THESE ANIMALS AND IN SPITE OF THE RAREFIED ATMOSPHERE
THE NEWS WAS RECEIVED WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS BY GLENARVAN AND THALCAVE THE SCOTCHMAN WAS GLAD OF THE CHANCE OF GLEANING SOME INFORMATION ABOUT HIS SHIPWRECKED COUNTRYMAN
WAS PERFECTLY EXASPERATED BY SUCH TRIFLING ANNOYANCES HE ABUSED THE POOR MOSQUITOES DESPERATELY AND DEPLORED THE LACK OF SOME ACID LOTION WHICH WOULD HAVE EASED THE PAIN OF THEIR STINGS
I CAN HOLD FIRM ON THAT'S ALL REPLIED ROBERT BLUSHING WITH PLEASURE AT SUCH AN ENCOMIUM
IT WAS COVERED WITH SNOW AND SCARCELY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SURROUNDING ROCKS BUT WILSON AND MULRADY SUCCEEDED IN DIGGING IT OUT AND CLEARING THE OPENING AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S HARD WORK TO THE GREAT JOY OF THE WHOLE PARTY
THALCAVE SAID NOTHING THINKING PROBABLY THAT IT WOULD BE TIME ENOUGH TO DESPAIR IF THE GUAMINI SHOULD BE DRIED UP
ONE DAY A MISSIONARY WAS REPROVING A CANNIBAL FOR THE HORRIBLE CUSTOM SO ABHORRENT TO GOD'S LAWS OF EATING HUMAN FLESH AND BESIDE SAID HE IT MUST BE SO NASTY OH FATHER SAID THE SAVAGE
ASIA AFRICA AMERICA AND EUROPE PERFECTLY SO NOW WE'LL TAKE OCEANICA FIRST WHERE ARE WE AT THIS MOMENT WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPAL DIVISIONS AUSTRALIA BELONGING TO THE ENGLISH
A PORTUGUESE MISSIONARY WAS ONE DAY VISITING AN OLD BRAZILIAN WOMAN WHO WAS VERY ILL SHE HAD ONLY A FEW DAYS TO LIVE THE JESUIT INCULCATED THE TRUTHS OF RELIGION WHICH THE DYING WOMAN ACCEPTED WITHOUT OBJECTION
THE LITTLE SAVAGES ARE VERY QUICK IN LEARNING GEOGRAPHY THEY LEARN IT EAGERLY AND ON THE OTHER HAND ARE PERFECTLY AVERSE TO THE SCIENCE OF ARITHMETIC TOLINE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THIS OUTBURST OF AFFECTION ON THE PART OF THE FRENCHMAN
THE COWARDS EXCLAIMED PAGANEL THEY SCAMPERED OFF TOO QUICK FOR HONEST FOLKS SAID MC NABBS
OH YOU INSUFFERABLE MAJOR IT WOULD SERVE YOU RIGHT REPLIED PAGANEL LAUGHING
THE SAVAGES BEGAN BY EATING HUMAN FLESH TO APPEASE THE DEMANDS OF AN APPETITE RARELY SATIATED SUBSEQUENTLY THE PRIESTS REGULATED AND SATISFIED THE MONSTROUS CUSTOM WHAT WAS A MEAL WAS RAISED TO THE DIGNITY OF A CEREMONY THAT IS ALL
I SUPPOSE REPLIED GLENARVAN
IF UNSKILLFUL SAILORS YOUR COMPANIONS JOHN SAY THE WORD AND WE ARE READY TO OBEY THE MAJOR PAGANEL ROBERT WILSON MULRADY OLBINETT HIMSELF APPLAUDED GLENARVAN'S SPEECH AND RANGED THEMSELVES ON THE DECK READY TO EXECUTE THEIR CAPTAIN'S ORDERS
BAH THE CONCLUSION OF ALL SAID JOHN MANGLES IS THAT WE MUST NOT FALL INTO THEIR HANDS LET US HOPE THAT ONE DAY CHRISTIANITY WILL ABOLISH ALL THESE MONSTROUS CUSTOMS YES WE MUST HOPE SO REPLIED PAGANEL BUT BELIEVE ME
AT LAKE SALINAS REPLIED THE INDIAN AND WHEN SHALL WE GET THERE TO MORROW EVENING
CARE OF JEFFRIES SMITH RAILWAY PORTER PREPAID THAT'S THE ENGLISH ALL OVER EXCLAIMED PAGANEL THEY SEND OFF A CHILD JUST AS THEY WOULD LUGGAGE AND BOOK HIM LIKE A PARCEL I HEARD IT WAS DONE CERTAINLY
DISDAINING THE FEATHERED TRIBES WHEN MORE SUBSTANTIAL GAME WAS AT HAND THE HUNTERS FIRST SHOTS WERE FIRED INTO THE UNDERWOOD INSTANTLY THERE ROSE BY THE HUNDRED ROEBUCKS AND GUANACOS
HE HAD BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO DISCOVER ON THE BANKS OF THE RIO A RAMADA A SORT OF ENCLOSURE WHICH HAD SERVED AS A FOLD FOR FLOCKS AND WAS SHUT IN ON THREE SIDES
WHATEVER THEY WERE THAT'S MY OPINION TOO SAID THE MAJOR FOR IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN INSTEAD OF BEING HARMLESS
A SORT OF TATOU COVERED WITH A HARD BONY SHELL IN MOVABLE PIECES AND MEASURING A FOOT AND A HALF LONG IT WAS VERY FAT AND WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT DISH THE PATAGONIAN SAID
QUESTION YOU WELL I'D LIKE NOTHING BETTER INDEED I WAS GOING TO DO IT WITHOUT YOUR LEAVE I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE HOW THEY TEACH GEOGRAPHY IN THE NORMAL SCHOOL OF MELBOURNE
I BELIEVE YOU ARE WRONG PAGANEL WRONG REPLIED PAGANEL YES THALCAVE TOOK THEM FOR ROBBERS AND HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT WELL THALCAVE WAS MISTAKEN THIS TIME RETORTED PAGANEL SOMEWHAT SHARPLY
CALAIS CRIED PAGANEL
THE LUNGS ARE SATISFIED WITH A PROVISION OF VEGETABLE AND FARINACEOUS FOOD BUT TO BE STRONG AND ACTIVE THE BODY MUST BE SUPPLIED WITH THOSE PLASTIC ELEMENTS THAT RENEW THE MUSCLES UNTIL THE MAORIES BECOME MEMBERS OF THE VEGETARIAN ASSOCIATION THEY WILL EAT MEAT AND HUMAN FLESH AS MEAT
ASKED ROBERT I SHOULD THINK SO MY BOY I'M A FRENCHMAN AND IN EVERY FRENCHMAN THERE IS A COOK FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARD PAGANEL BEGAN TO GRILL
OUR FRIEND MC NABBS IS RIGHT SAID GLENARVAN GET EVERYTHING IN READINESS FOR SUPPER AND I'LL GO OUT AND TURN WOODCUTTER WILSON AND I WILL GO WITH YOU SAID PAGANEL DO YOU WANT ME ASKED ROBERT GETTING UP
THE MOMENT THEREFORE THAT THALCAVE GOT TO A RIGHT DISTANCE
BUT IN ANY CASE WHAT HAVE WE TO FEAR SURELY TWO RESOLUTE AND WELL ARMED EUROPEANS NEED NOT GIVE A THOUGHT TO AN ATTACK BY A HANDFUL OF MISERABLE BEINGS PAGANEL SHOOK HIS HEAD IN THIS CASE THERE ARE NO MISERABLE BEINGS TO CONTEND WITH
HIS COMPANIONS HAD HARDLY TIME TO THANK HIM FOR HIS OBLIGING GOOD NATURE WHEN DISTANT AND PROLONGED HOWLS BROKE ON THEIR EAR PLAINLY NOT PROCEEDING FROM ONE OR TWO SOLITARY ANIMALS
ON THE FIRST PAGE WAS WRITTEN THE WORDS NORMAL SCHOOL MELBOURNE FIRST PRIZE FOR GEOGRAPHY TOLINE OF THE LACHLAN PAGANEL WAS BESIDE HIMSELF AN AUSTRALIAN WELL VERSED IN GEOGRAPHY THIS WAS MARVELOUS
YES SIR WAS TOLINE'S REPLY BUT THE GOD OF THE BIBLE PROTECTED ME ARE YOU TRAVELING ALONE YES ALONE THE REVEREND PAXTON PUT ME IN CHARGE OF JEFFRIES SMITH
TWENTY MILES WOULD BE NOTHING IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY THAN NEW ZEALAND YOU CANNOT SUSPECT ME OF FAINT HEARTEDNESS I WAS THE FIRST TO PERSUADE YOU TO CROSS AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA BUT HERE THE CASE IS DIFFERENT I REPEAT ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN TO VENTURE INTO THIS TREACHEROUS COUNTRY
INSTEAD OF LANDING ITS FREIGHT ON THE COAST
HOLDING ON BY TUFTS OF LICHEN AND GIDDY AND TERRIFIED IN THE EXTREME WAS RUSHING DOWN THE DECLIVITY WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF AN EXPRESS AT THE RATE OF FIFTY MILES AN HOUR NOT A CRY WAS POSSIBLE
THE WORD PAMPA OF ARAUCANIAN ORIGIN SIGNIFIES GRASS PLAIN
NO MOST CERTAINLY I DON'T KNOW THAT WELL IT IS TIME YOU DID MY LORD SAID THE BOY SEIZING HIS LORDSHIP'S HAND AND COVERING IT WITH KISSES GLENARVAN SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT SAID NO MORE AS A GESTURE FROM THALCAVE MADE THEM SPUR ON THEIR HORSES AND HURRY FORWARD
SHOWED THEMSELVES TO BE ACCOMPLISHED RIDERS
WHILE THE OTHERS WHOSE STEEDS ARE FRESHER ARE TO PUSH ON IN ADVANCE TOWARD THE RIVER GUAMINI WHICH THROWS ITSELF INTO LAKE SAN LUCAS ABOUT THIRTY ONE MILES OFF IF THERE SHOULD BE WATER ENOUGH IN THE RIVER THEY ARE TO WAIT ON THE BANKS TILL THEIR COMPANIONS REACH THEM
AND WAS SPEEDING DOWN TOWARD THE PLAIN AN EARTHQUAKE EXCLAIMED PAGANEL HE WAS NOT MISTAKEN IT WAS ONE OF THOSE CATACLYSMS FREQUENT IN CHILI AND IN THIS VERY REGION WHERE
NOR AN ATTEMPT TO GET OFF OR STOP THEY COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HEARD THEMSELVES SPEAK
OUT OF WHICH IT EMERGED INTO A MOST CHARMING REGION WHERE GRAND TREES NOT CLOSELY PLANTED BUT IN SCATTERED GROUPS WERE GROWING WITH ABSOLUTELY TROPICAL LUXURIANCE AS THE PARTY DROVE ON THEY STUMBLED UPON A LITTLE NATIVE BOY
CANNIBALISM HAS BECOME A FIXED FACT IN NEW ZEALAND AS IT IS IN THE FIJIS AND IN TORRES STRAIT SUPERSTITION IS NO DOUBT PARTLY TO BLAME BUT CANNIBALISM IS CERTAINLY OWING TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN GAME IS SCARCE AND HUNGER GREAT
THALCAVE DRANK VERY QUIETLY WITHOUT HURRYING HIMSELF TAKING SMALL GULPS BUT AS LONG AS A LAZO AS THE PATAGONIANS SAY HE SEEMED AS IF HE WERE NEVER GOING TO LEAVE OFF AND REALLY THERE WAS SOME DANGER OF HIS SWALLOWING UP THE WHOLE RIVER AT LAST GLENARVAN SAID
HE PREFERRED THEM SIMPLY TATTOOED AND THIS CONVENTIONAL DRESS JARRED ON HIS PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
AND FOR WANT OF BETTER WORK PAGANEL WHILED AWAY THE TIME ALONG THE ROAD BY PRACTISING THE DIFFICULTIES IN PRONUNCIATION REPEATING ALL THE BREAK JAW WORDS HE COULD THOUGH STILL MAKING GEOGRAPHICAL OBSERVATIONS
DON'T FRIGHTEN YOURSELF MY BOY SAID GLENARVAN OUR FRIEND PAGANEL EXAGGERATES FAR FROM IT REJOINED PAGANEL ROBERT HAS SHOWN HIMSELF A MAN AND I TREAT HIM AS SUCH IN NOT CONCEALING THE TRUTH FROM HIM PAGANEL WAS RIGHT
THE FAR FAMED ARGENTINE BREED THOSE REARED IN THE COUNTRY ARE MUCH SUPERIOR TO THEIR PROGENITORS THEY ARE NOT PARTICULAR ABOUT THEIR FOOD AND ONLY DRINK ONCE A DAY AND THEY CAN GO WITH EASE TEN LEAGUES IN EIGHT HOURS THERE ARE NO INNS
AND WHAT DO THEY TEACH YOU SHE WENT ON TO SAY THEY TEACH ME THE BIBLE AND MATHEMATICS AND GEOGRAPHY PAGANEL PRICKED UP HIS EARS AT THIS AND SAID INDEED GEOGRAPHY YES SIR SAID TOLINE
A FEW WORDS OF WHICH WERE INTELLIGIBLE TO GLENARVAN THALCAVE SPOKE CALMLY BUT THE LIVELY FRENCHMAN GESTICULATED ENOUGH FOR BOTH AFTER A LITTLE THALCAVE SAT SILENT AND FOLDED HIS ARMS WHAT DOES HE SAY ASKED GLENARVAN I FANCIED HE WAS ADVISING US TO SEPARATE
HE WAS ONE OF THE POOR NATIVE CHILDREN CONFIDED TO THE CARE OF CHARITABLE SOCIETIES BY THE NEIGHBORING TRIBES THE AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES ARE GENTLE AND INOFFENSIVE
THERE ARE EVEN MAN EATING SEASONS
FOR TWO DAYS THEY PLODDED STEADILY ACROSS THIS ARID AND DESERTED PLAIN THE DRY HEAT BECAME SEVERE THERE WERE NOT ONLY NO RIOS BUT EVEN THE PONDS DUG OUT BY THE INDIANS WERE DRIED UP AS THE DROUGHT SEEMED TO INCREASE WITH EVERY MILE
TOWARD WHICH THE TRAVELERS MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE TO BETAKE THEMSELVES SHOULD THE GUAMINI DISAPPOINT THEIR HOPES THE LANDSCAPE WAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT
HE CARRIES HIS COOKING APPARATUS WITH HIM AND ALL THAT HAD TO BE DONE WAS TO PLACE HIM IN HIS OWN SHELL OVER THE GLOWING EMBERS THE SUBSTANTIAL DISHES WERE RESERVED FOR THE NIGHT COMERS AND THE THREE HUNTERS CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH DEVOURING THE PARTRIDGES AND WASHED DOWN THEIR MEAL WITH CLEAR FRESH WATER
WHAT IS IT AND THEN I WILL TELL YOU THAT ALL THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE WITH YOU ARE BRAVE LADY HELENA WHOM I LOVE SO AND THE MAJOR WITH HIS CALM MANNER AND CAPTAIN MANGLES AND MONSIEUR PAGANEL AND ALL THE SAILORS ON THE DUNCAN HOW COURAGEOUS AND DEVOTED THEY ARE
ENGLAND IRELAND SCOTLAND MALTA JERSEY AND GUERN SEY THE IONIAN ISLANDS THE HEBRIDES THE SHETLANDS
DEEPLY TOUCHED BY THE BOY'S GENUINE AFFECTION DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE HORSES HAD BEEN SLACKENING SPEED AND WERE ONLY WALKING NOW
ON THE TOP OF THE CORDILLERAS EXCLAIMED MULRADY IN A DUBIOUS TONE SINCE THERE IS A CHIMNEY IN THE CASUCHA SAID THE MAJOR THE PROBABILITY IS THAT WE SHALL FIND SOMETHING TO BURN IN IT
ADDING IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS
IT IS NOW RATHER MORE THAN SEVEN MONTHS SINCE I RECEIVED FROM M VALDEMAR HIMSELF THE SUBJOINED NOTE MY DEAR P YOU MAY AS WELL COME NOW D AND F ARE AGREED THAT I CANNOT HOLD OUT BEYOND TO MORROW MIDNIGHT
WHICH I HAD ALREADY FOUND MOST EFFECTUAL IN SUBDUING HIM HE WAS EVIDENTLY INFLUENCED WITH THE FIRST LATERAL STROKE OF MY HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD BUT ALTHOUGH I EXERTED ALL MY POWERS NO FURTHER PERCEPTIBLE EFFECT WAS INDUCED UNTIL SOME MINUTES AFTER TEN O'CLOCK
THERE WERE ARABESQUE FIGURES WITH UNSUITED LIMBS AND APPOINTMENTS THERE WERE DELIRIOUS FANCIES SUCH AS THE MADMAN FASHIONS THERE WAS MUCH OF THE BEAUTIFUL MUCH OF THE WANTON MUCH OF THE BIZARRE SOMETHING OF THE TERRIBLE AND NOT A LITTLE OF THAT WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXCITED DISGUST
IT IS ONLY A MOUSE CROSSING THE FLOOR OR IT IS MERELY A CRICKET WHICH HAS MADE A SINGLE CHIRP YES HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO COMFORT HIMSELF WITH THESE SUPPOSITIONS BUT HE HAD FOUND ALL IN VAIN ALL IN VAIN BECAUSE DEATH
IT WAS FOUR O'CLOCK STILL DARK AS MIDNIGHT AS THE BELL SOUNDED THE HOUR THERE CAME A KNOCKING AT THE STREET DOOR I WENT DOWN TO OPEN IT WITH A LIGHT HEART FOR WHAT HAD I NOW TO FEAR THERE ENTERED THREE MEN WHO INTRODUCED THEMSELVES
KIND OF HALF PRECISE HALF NEGLIGENT AND WHOLLY PICTURESQUE DEFINITION CLUMPS OF WILD FLOWERS GREW EVERYWHERE LUXURIANTLY IN THE INTERSPACES WHAT TO MAKE OF ALL THIS OF COURSE
ACCOMPANIED NOW AND THEN BY MEDICAL AND OTHER FRIENDS ALL THIS TIME THE SLEEPER WAKER REMAINED EXACTLY AS I HAVE LAST DESCRIBED HIM THE NURSES ATTENTIONS WERE CONTINUAL IT WAS ON FRIDAY LAST
AND THE CIRCULAR HECTIC SPOTS WHICH HITHERTO HAD BEEN STRONGLY DEFINED IN THE CENTRE OF EACH CHEEK WENT OUT AT ONCE I USE THIS EXPRESSION BECAUSE THE SUDDENNESS OF THEIR DEPARTURE
I MADE UP MY MIND TO TAKE THE LIFE OF THE OLD MAN AND THUS RID MYSELF OF THE EYE FOREVER NOW THIS IS THE POINT YOU FANCY ME MAD MADMEN KNOW NOTHING BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW WISELY I PROCEEDED
YET FOR SOME MINUTES LONGER I REFRAINED AND STOOD STILL BUT THE BEATING GREW LOUDER LOUDER I THOUGHT THE HEART MUST BURST AND NOW A NEW ANXIETY SEIZED ME THE SOUND WOULD BE HEARD BY A NEIGHBOUR THE OLD MAN'S HOUR HAD COME
ONLY TWO BERTHS IN THE VESSEL AND THE BERTHS OF A SLOOP OF SIXTY OR TWENTY TONS NEED SCARCELY BE DESCRIBED THAT WHICH I OCCUPIED HAD NO BEDDING OF ANY KIND ITS EXTREME WIDTH WAS EIGHTEEN INCHES THE DISTANCE OF ITS BOTTOM
MADE ITS WAY INTO SOCIETY AND BECAME THE SOURCE OF MANY UNPLEASANT MISREPRESENTATIONS AND VERY NATURALLY OF A GREAT DEAL OF DISBELIEF IT IS NOW RENDERED NECESSARY THAT I GIVE THE FACTS
I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NOW RELATED ALL THAT IS NECESSARY
WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF WE ADDRESSED OURSELVES AGAIN TO AN INVESTIGATION OF M VALDEMAR'S CONDITION IT REMAINED IN ALL RESPECTS AS I HAVE LAST DESCRIBED IT WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THE MIRROR NO LONGER AFFORDED EVIDENCE
BUT EVEN YET I REFRAINED AND KEPT STILL I SCARCELY BREATHED I HELD THE LANTERN MOTIONLESS I TRIED HOW STEADILY I COULD MAINTAIN THE RAY
THE PREMATURE BURIAL THERE ARE CERTAIN THEMES OF WHICH THE INTEREST IS ALL ABSORBING BUT WHICH ARE TOO ENTIRELY HORRIBLE FOR THE PURPOSES OF LEGITIMATE FICTION
THERE WERE SHARP PAINS AND SUDDEN DIZZINESS AND THEN PROFUSE BLEEDING AT THE PORES WITH DISSOLUTION
HIS INTEREST SEEMED VIVIDLY EXCITED I SAY TO MY SURPRISE FOR ALTHOUGH HE HAD ALWAYS YIELDED HIS PERSON FREELY TO MY EXPERIMENTS HE HAD NEVER BEFORE GIVEN ME ANY TOKENS OF SYMPATHY WITH WHAT I DID
BUT THE PRINCE PROSPERO WAS HAPPY AND DAUNTLESS AND SAGACIOUS WHEN HIS DOMINIONS WERE HALF DEPOPULATED HE SUMMONED TO HIS PRESENCE A THOUSAND HALE AND LIGHT HEARTED FRIENDS FROM AMONG THE KNIGHTS AND DAMES OF HIS COURT
AT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE ELEVEN I PERCEIVED UNEQUIVOCAL SIGNS OF THE MESMERIC INFLUENCE THE GLASSY ROLL OF THE EYE WAS CHANGED FOR THAT EXPRESSION OF UNEASY INWARD EXAMINATION
AS INVENTIONS WE SHOULD REGARD THEM WITH SIMPLE ABHORRENCE I HAVE MENTIONED
NO PERSON PRESENT EVEN AFFECTED TO DENY
THERE WAS A SHARP CRY AND THE DAGGER DROPPED GLEAMING UPON THE SABLE CARPET UPON WHICH INSTANTLY AFTERWARDS FELL PROSTRATE IN DEATH THE PRINCE PROSPERO
IT WAS HIS CUSTOM INDEED TO SPEAK CALMLY OF HIS APPROACHING DISSOLUTION AS OF A MATTER NEITHER TO BE AVOIDED NOR REGRETTED WHEN THE IDEAS TO WHICH I HAVE ALLUDED FIRST OCCURRED TO ME IT WAS OF COURSE VERY NATURAL THAT I SHOULD THINK OF M VALDEMAR
NO BLOOD SPOT WHATEVER I HAD BEEN TOO WARY FOR THAT A TUB HAD CAUGHT ALL HA HA
THERE HAD BEEN A VERY REMARKABLE AND MOST UNACCOUNTABLE OMISSION NO PERSON HAD AS YET BEEN MESMERIZED IN ARTICULO MORTIS IT REMAINED TO BE SEEN FIRST WHETHER
THERE WERE BUFFOONS THERE WERE IMPROVISATORI THERE WERE BALLET DANCERS THERE WERE MUSICIANS THERE WAS BEAUTY THERE WAS WINE ALL THESE AND SECURITY WERE WITHIN WITHOUT WAS THE RED DEATH
TO QUERIES PUT TO HIM BY ANY OTHER PERSON THAN MYSELF HE SEEMED UTTERLY INSENSIBLE ALTHOUGH I ENDEAVORED TO PLACE EACH MEMBER OF THE COMPANY IN MESMERIC RAPPORT WITH HIM
OF COURSE I SHALL NOT PRETEND TO CONSIDER IT ANY MATTER FOR WONDER THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF M VALDEMAR HAS EXCITED DISCUSSION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MIRACLE HAD IT NOT ESPECIALLY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
AND EXPRESSED UNBOUNDED ASTONISHMENT AT FINDING THE PATIENT STILL ALIVE AFTER FEELING THE PULSE AND APPLYING A MIRROR TO THE LIPS HE REQUESTED ME TO SPEAK TO THE SLEEP WAKER AGAIN I DID SO SAYING M VALDEMAR DO YOU STILL SLEEP
WHEN OVERCHARGED WITH AWE I KNEW THE SOUND WELL MANY A NIGHT JUST AT MIDNIGHT WHEN ALL THE WORLD SLEPT
MEANTIME THE HELLISH TATTOO OF THE HEART INCREASED IT GREW QUICKER AND QUICKER AND LOUDER AND LOUDER EVERY INSTANT THE OLD MAN'S TERROR MUST HAVE BEEN EXTREME IT GREW LOUDER I SAY LOUDER EVERY MOMENT
AND DIVERGING VERY SLIGHTLY AND GRADUALLY
AND NOT FROM THE LIPS OF THE SUFFERER HIS WHOLE FRAME AT ONCE WITHIN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE MINUTE
HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE I MIGHT REFER AT ONCE IF NECESSARY TO A HUNDRED WELL AUTHENTICATED INSTANCES ONE OF VERY REMARKABLE CHARACTER
THIS OCCURRED IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE AND CREATED AT THE TIME A VERY PROFOUND SENSATION WHEREVER IT WAS MADE THE SUBJECT OF CONVERSE
THEY CHATTED OF FAMILIAR THINGS BUT ERE LONG I FELT MYSELF GETTING PALE AND WISHED THEM GONE MY HEAD ACHED AND I FANCIED A RINGING IN MY EARS BUT STILL THEY SAT AND STILL CHATTED THE RINGING BECAME MORE DISTINCT IT CONTINUED
WHICH HAS GIVEN RISE TO SO MUCH DISCUSSION IN PRIVATE CIRCLES TO SO MUCH OF WHAT I CANNOT HELP THINKING UNWARRANTED POPULAR FEELING
AND YET ALL THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENDURED IF NOT APPROVED BY THE MAD REVELLERS AROUND BUT THE MUMMER HAD GONE SO FAR AS TO ASSUME THE TYPE OF THE RED DEATH HIS VESTURE WAS DABBLED IN BLOOD AND HIS BROAD BROW WITH ALL THE FEATURES OF THE FACE WAS BESPRINKLED WITH THE SCARLET HORROR
I REMOVED THE BED AND EXAMINED THE CORPSE YES HE WAS STONE STONE DEAD I PLACED MY HAND UPON THE HEART AND HELD IT THERE MANY MINUTES THERE WAS NO PULSATION HE WAS STONE DEAD HIS EYE WOULD TROUBLE ME NO MORE
THE LITTLE VALE INTO WHICH I THUS PEERED DOWN FROM UNDER THE FOG CANOPY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YARDS LONG WHILE IN BREADTH IT VARIED FROM
I NEED NOT REMIND THE READER THAT FROM THE LONG AND WEIRD CATALOGUE OF HUMAN MISERIES I MIGHT HAVE SELECTED MANY INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES MORE REPLETE WITH ESSENTIAL SUFFERING THAN ANY OF THESE VAST GENERALITIES OF DISASTER THE TRUE WRETCHEDNESS INDEED THE ULTIMATE WOE
AND HE NOT EVEN TO DREAM OF MY SECRET DEEDS OR THOUGHTS I FAIRLY CHUCKLED AT THE IDEA AND PERHAPS HE HEARD ME FOR HE MOVED ON THE BED SUDDENLY AS IF STARTLED NOW YOU MAY THINK THAT I DREW BACK BUT NO
DOCTORS D AND F WERE IN ATTENDANCE AFTER PRESSING VALDEMAR'S HAND I TOOK THESE GENTLEMEN ASIDE AND OBTAINED FROM THEM A MINUTE ACCOUNT OF THE PATIENT'S CONDITION THE LEFT LUNG HAD BEEN FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS
SO FAR THAT I COULD SEE HIM AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED HA WOULD A MADMAN HAVE BEEN SO WISE AS THIS AND THEN WHEN MY HEAD WAS WELL IN THE ROOM I UNDID THE LANTERN CAUTIOUSLY OH SO CAUTIOUSLY
THESE YET AGAIN BY STILL MORE GRACEFUL AND MORE MODEST VARIETIES THE WHOLE FACE OF THE SOUTHERN DECLIVITY WAS COVERED WITH WILD SHRUBBERY ALONE AN OCCASIONAL SILVER WILLOW OR WHITE POPLAR EXCEPTED
FROM THE INNUMERABLE IMAGES OF GLOOM WHICH THUS OPPRESSED ME IN DREAMS I SELECT FOR RECORD BUT A SOLITARY VISION
VISUAL FACULTIES AND YET IT WAS DARK ALL DARK THE INTENSE AND UTTER RAYLESSNESS OF THE NIGHT THAT ENDURETH FOR EVERMORE I ENDEAVORED TO SHRIEK AND MY LIPS AND MY PARCHED TONGUE MOVED CONVULSIVELY
DEEPENING WITH ITS DREADFUL ECHO THE TERRORS THAT DISTRACTED ME I SAY I KNEW IT WELL I KNEW WHAT THE OLD MAN FELT AND PITIED HIM ALTHOUGH I CHUCKLED AT HEART
THE PATIENT WAS SUSPECTED OF ANEURISM OF THE AORTA BUT ON THIS POINT THE OSSEOUS SYMPTOMS RENDERED AN EXACT DIAGNOSIS IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS THE OPINION OF BOTH PHYSICIANS
WHEN THE EYES OF PRINCE PROSPERO FELL UPON THIS SPECTRAL IMAGE WHICH WITH A SLOW AND SOLEMN MOVEMENT AS IF MORE FULLY TO SUSTAIN ITS ROLE STALKED TO AND FRO AMONG THE WALTZERS
IN THE FIRST PLACE THE VOICE SEEMED TO REACH OUR EARS AT LEAST MINE FROM A VAST DISTANCE OR FROM SOME DEEP CAVERN WITHIN THE EARTH
UNTIL AT LENGTH JUST AS I HAD BEGUN TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE NUMEROUS LITTLE GLADES THAT LED HITHER AND THITHER
AND BECAME MORE DISTINCT I TALKED MORE FREELY TO GET RID OF THE FEELING BUT IT CONTINUED AND GAINED DEFINITENESS UNTIL AT LENGTH I FOUND THAT THE NOISE WAS NOT WITHIN MY EARS NO DOUBT I NOW GREW VERY PALE BUT I TALKED MORE FLUENTLY
AND THEN THE MUSIC CEASED AS I HAVE TOLD
WITH A LOUD YELL I THREW OPEN THE LANTERN AND LEAPED INTO THE ROOM HE SHRIEKED ONCE ONCE ONLY IN AN INSTANT I DRAGGED HIM TO THE FLOOR
THE FIRST INDICATION OF REVIVAL WAS AFFORDED BY A PARTIAL DESCENT OF THE IRIS IT WAS OBSERVED AS ESPECIALLY REMARKABLE THAT THIS LOWERING OF THE PUPIL WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE PROFUSE OUT FLOWING
WERE THE CREW OF THE SLOOP AND SOME LABORERS ENGAGED TO UNLOAD IT FROM THE LOAD ITSELF CAME THE EARTHLY SMELL THE BANDAGE ABOUT THE JAWS WAS A SILK HANDKERCHIEF IN WHICH I HAD BOUND UP MY HEAD IN DEFAULT OF MY CUSTOMARY NIGHTCAP
THE APARTMENTS WERE SO IRREGULARLY DISPOSED THAT THE VISION EMBRACED BUT LITTLE MORE THAN ONE AT A TIME THERE WAS A SHARP TURN AT EVERY TWENTY OR THIRTY YARDS AND AT EACH TURN A NOVEL EFFECT
IN MANY PALACES HOWEVER SUCH SUITES FORM A LONG AND STRAIGHT VISTA WHILE THE FOLDING DOORS SLIDE BACK NEARLY TO THE WALLS ON EITHER HAND SO THAT THE VIEW OF THE WHOLE EXTENT IS SCARCELY IMPEDED HERE THE CASE WAS VERY DIFFERENT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM THE DUKE'S LOVE OF THE BIZARRE
THIS FISSURE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TEN YARDS WIDE AT ITS WIDEST POINT SO FAR AS THE EYE COULD TRACE IT IT SEEMED TO LEAD UP
WE CAN DETECT A TORPID UNEQUAL AND VACILLATING ACTION OF THE LUNGS THEN AGAIN THE DURATION OF THE TRANCE IS FOR WEEKS EVEN FOR MONTHS WHILE THE CLOSEST SCRUTINY AND THE MOST RIGOROUS MEDICAL TESTS FAIL TO ESTABLISH ANY
TAKING HUE FROM THE ROOMS AND CAUSING THE WILD MUSIC OF THE ORCHESTRA TO SEEM AS THE ECHO OF THEIR STEPS AND ANON THERE STRIKES THE EBONY CLOCK WHICH STANDS IN THE HALL OF THE VELVET AND THEN FOR A MOMENT ALL IS STILL AND ALL IS SILENT SAVE THE VOICE OF THE CLOCK
THOU DOST FEEL THAT I SHUDDER MY TEETH CHATTER AS I SPEAK
WHILE DOCTOR F TOOK LEAVE WITH A PROMISE TO RETURN AT DAYBREAK
DISINTER THE BODY AND DISSECT IT AT LEISURE IN PRIVATE ARRANGEMENTS WERE EASILY EFFECTED WITH SOME OF THE NUMEROUS CORPS OF BODY SNATCHERS WITH WHICH LONDON ABOUNDS AND UPON THE THIRD NIGHT AFTER THE FUNERAL
IN THE AFTERNOON WE ALL CALLED AGAIN TO SEE THE PATIENT HIS CONDITION REMAINED PRECISELY THE SAME WE HAD NOW SOME DISCUSSION AS TO THE PROPRIETY AND FEASIBILITY OF AWAKENING HIM BUT WE HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY
AFTER A FEW EXPERIMENTS THEY ADMITTED HIM TO BE AN UNUSUALLY PERFECT STATE OF MESMERIC TRANCE THE CURIOSITY OF BOTH THE PHYSICIANS WAS GREATLY EXCITED DOCTOR D RESOLVED AT ONCE TO REMAIN WITH THE PATIENT ALL NIGHT
AND WITH CONSCIOUSNESS THAT OF THIS FATE THEY CAN NEVER BE INFORMED THAT OUR HOPELESS PORTION IS THAT OF THE REALLY DEAD THESE CONSIDERATIONS I SAY CARRY INTO THE HEART WHICH STILL
AS HE WAS EVIDENTLY SINKING FAST
YES STILL ASLEEP DYING IT WAS NOW THE OPINION OR RATHER THE WISH OF THE PHYSICIANS THAT M VALDEMAR SHOULD BE SUFFERED TO REMAIN UNDISTURBED IN HIS PRESENT APPARENTLY TRANQUIL CONDITION
IT HAUNTED ME DAY AND NIGHT OBJECT THERE WAS NONE PASSION THERE WAS NONE I LOVED THE OLD MAN HE HAD NEVER WRONGED ME HE HAD NEVER GIVEN ME INSULT FOR HIS GOLD I HAD NO DESIRE I THINK IT WAS HIS EYE
HIS PLANS WERE BOLD AND FIERY AND HIS CONCEPTIONS GLOWED WITH BARBARIC LUSTRE
IN A SEMI OSSEOUS OR CARTILAGINOUS STATE
THE BLACKNESS OF THE ABSOLUTE NIGHT THE SILENCE LIKE A SEA THAT OVERWHELMS THE UNSEEN BUT PALPABLE PRESENCE OF THE CONQUEROR WORM
NO ONE SUSPECTED INDEED OR HAD REASON TO SUSPECT THAT SHE WAS NOT ACTUALLY DEAD
THE FACTS IN THE CASE OF M VALDEMAR
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SO FAR DEATH OR WHAT IS USUALLY TERMED DEATH HAD BEEN ARRESTED BY THE MESMERIC PROCESS IT SEEMED CLEAR TO US ALL
THAT HE WOULD TAKE NOTES OF ALL THAT OCCURRED AND IT IS FROM HIS MEMORANDA
FASHIONED UPON THE PRINCIPLE OF THE VAULT DOOR
AND MADE SPASMODIC EXERTIONS TO FORCE OPEN THE LID IT WOULD NOT MOVE I FELT MY WRISTS FOR THE BELL ROPE IT WAS NOT TO BE FOUND AND NOW THE COMFORTER FLED FOR EVER
ITS PENDULUM SWUNG TO AND FRO WITH A DULL HEAVY MONOTONOUS CLANG AND WHEN THE MINUTE HAND MADE THE CIRCUIT OF THE FACE AND THE HOUR WAS TO BE STRICKEN THERE CAME FROM THE BRAZEN LUNGS OF THE CLOCK A SOUND WHICH WAS CLEAR AND LOUD AND DEEP AND EXCEEDINGLY MUSICAL
TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH WALL A TALL AND NARROW GOTHIC WINDOW LOOKED OUT UPON A CLOSED CORRIDOR WHICH PURSUED THE WINDINGS OF THE SUITE THESE WINDOWS WERE OF STAINED GLASS WHOSE COLOR VARIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PREVAILING HUE OF THE DECORATIONS OF THE CHAMBER INTO WHICH IT OPENED
THE DREAMS ARE STIFF FROZEN AS THEY STAND BUT THE ECHOES OF THE CHIME DIE AWAY THEY HAVE ENDURED BUT AN INSTANT AND A LIGHT HALF SUBDUED LAUGHTER FLOATS AFTER THEM AS THEY DEPART
BUT NOW THERE WERE TWELVE STROKES TO BE SOUNDED BY THE BELL OF THE CLOCK AND THUS IT HAPPENED PERHAPS THAT MORE OF THOUGHT CREPT WITH MORE OF TIME INTO THE MEDITATIONS OF THE THOUGHTFUL AMONG THOSE WHO REVELLED
OF THE CEMETERY WERE AS USUAL MUCH THRONGED WITH VISITERS AND ABOUT NOON AN INTENSE EXCITEMENT WAS CREATED BY THE DECLARATION OF A PEASANT THAT WHILE SITTING UPON THE GRAVE OF THE OFFICER HE HAD DISTINCTLY FELT A COMMOTION OF THE EARTH AS IF OCCASIONED BY SOME ONE STRUGGLING BENEATH
BUT ANYTHING WAS BETTER THAN THIS AGONY ANYTHING WAS MORE TOLERABLE THAN THIS DERISION I COULD BEAR THOSE HYPOCRITICAL SMILES NO LONGER I FELT THAT I MUST SCREAM OR DIE AND NOW AGAIN HARK LOUDER LOUDER
THAT AT THE EASTERN EXTREMITY WAS HUNG FOR EXAMPLE IN BLUE AND VIVIDLY BLUE WERE ITS WINDOWS THE SECOND CHAMBER WAS PURPLE IN ITS ORNAMENTS AND TAPESTRIES AND HERE THE PANES WERE PURPLE THE THIRD WAS GREEN THROUGHOUT AND SO WERE THE CASEMENTS
ALL THAT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DONE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE HERE WITH SUCH NATURAL CAPABILITIES AS THEY HAVE IT IN THE BOOKS ON LANDSCAPE GARDENING WITH VERY LITTLE LABOR AND EXPENSE NO
THE NURSES IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE CHAMBER AND COULD NOT BE INDUCED TO RETURN MY OWN IMPRESSIONS I WOULD NOT PRETEND TO RENDER INTELLIGIBLE TO THE READER FOR NEARLY AN HOUR
SO YOU SEE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY PROFOUND OLD MAN INDEED TO SUSPECT THAT EVERY NIGHT JUST AT TWELVE I LOOKED IN UPON HIM WHILE HE SLEPT UPON THE EIGHTH NIGHT I WAS MORE THAN USUALLY CAUTIOUS IN OPENING THE DOOR
OF RESPIRATION AN ATTEMPT TO DRAW BLOOD FROM THE ARM FAILED I SHOULD MENTION TOO THAT THIS LIMB WAS NO FARTHER SUBJECT TO MY WILL I ENDEAVORED IN VAIN TO MAKE IT FOLLOW THE DIRECTION OF MY HAND
WAS IT POSSIBLE THEY HEARD NOT ALMIGHTY GOD NO NO THEY HEARD THEY SUSPECTED THEY KNEW THEY WERE MAKING A MOCKERY OF MY HORROR THIS I THOUGHT AND THIS I THINK
I SAUNTERED ON THEREFORE QUITE AT EASE
ENTHUSIASTIC HIS IMAGINATION WAS SINGULARLY VIGOROUS AND CREATIVE AND NO DOUBT IT DERIVED ADDITIONAL FORCE FROM THE HABITUAL USE OF MORPHINE WHICH HE SWALLOWED IN GREAT QUANTITY
THERE DESCENDED AN EFFEMINATE LOOKING PERSON
THIS THEN WAS THE SMILE WHICH HAD CHEERED US ON TO HOPE THIS THE BUT I FORBEAR THE BRIG AS I HAVE ALREADY TOLD PASSED UNDER OUR STERN AND MADE ITS WAY SLOWLY BUT STEADILY TO LEEWARD
CHAPTER TEN SHORTLY AFTERWARD AN INCIDENT OCCURRED WHICH I AM INDUCED TO LOOK UPON AS MORE INTENSELY PRODUCTIVE OF EMOTION AS FAR MORE REPLETE WITH THE EXTREMES
THE POISONOUS SANGSUE OF CHARLOTTESVILLE MAY ALWAYS BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE MEDICINAL LEECH BY ITS BLACKNESS AND ESPECIALLY BY ITS WRITHING OR VERMICULAR MOTIONS WHICH VERY NEARLY RESEMBLE THOSE OF A SNAKE
RESPECTING WHOSE EXISTENCE A GREAT DIVERSITY OF OPINION HAS EXISTED
SO CLOSELY RESEMBLING THE SCREAM OF A HUMAN VOICE THAT THE NICEST EAR MIGHT HAVE BEEN STARTLED AND DECEIVED AT THIS INSTANT ANOTHER SUDDEN YAW BROUGHT THE REGION OF THE FORECASTLE FOR A MOMENT INTO VIEW
A TALE OF THE RAGGED MOUNTAINS DURING THE FALL OF THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEVEN WHILE RESIDING NEAR CHARLOTTESVILLE VIRGINIA I CASUALLY MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MISTER AUGUSTUS BEDLOE
AND WITH A DEEP SHUDDER THREW THE FRIGHTFUL THING INTO THE SEA THE BODY FROM WHICH IT HAD BEEN TAKEN RESTING AS IT DID UPON THE ROPE HAD BEEN EASILY SWAYED TO AND FRO BY THE EXERTIONS OF THE CARNIVOROUS BIRD
ARRIVED AT THE PLACE WHERE THEY FOUND AN ENGLISHMAN OF THE NAME OF GLASS FORMERLY A CORPORAL IN THE BRITISH ARTILLERY HE CLAIMED TO BE SUPREME GOVERNOR OF THE ISLANDS AND HAD UNDER HIS CONTROL TWENTY ONE MEN AND THREE WOMEN
PETERS AND AUGUSTUS TOOK LITTLE NOTICE OF WHAT HE SAID BEING APPARENTLY WRAPPED UP IN MOODY CONTEMPLATION UPON LOOKING IN THE DIRECTION POINTED OUT I COULD NOT PERCEIVE THE FAINTEST APPEARANCE OF THE SHORE
THERE ARE NO SHOALS OR OTHER DANGERS ABOUT THE ISLAND THE SHORES BEING REMARKABLY BOLD AND THE WATER DEEP ON THE NORTHWESTERN COAST IS A BAY WITH A BEACH OF BLACK SAND WHERE A LANDING WITH BOATS CAN BE EASILY EFFECTED PROVIDED THERE BE A SOUTHERLY WIND
AND SMILING CONSTANTLY SO AS TO DISPLAY A SET OF THE MOST BRILLIANTLY WHITE TEETH AS HIS VESSEL DREW NEARER WE SAW A RED FLANNEL CAP WHICH HE HAD ON FALL FROM HIS HEAD INTO THE WATER
WHEN WE FOUND OURSELVES ON THE DEBATED GROUND
WE AFTERWARD PASSED PRINCE EDWARD'S ISLAND LEAVING IT ALSO ON OUR LEFT THEN STEERING MORE TO THE NORTHWARD MADE IN FIFTEEN DAYS THE ISLANDS OF TRISTAN D'ACUNHA IN LATITUDE
WERE OF THE MOST FEARFUL AND GLOOMY NATURE NO PROSPECT OFFERED ITSELF TO MY VIEW BUT A LINGERING DEATH BY FAMINE OR AT THE BEST BY BEING OVERWHELMED IN THE FIRST GALE WHICH SHOULD SPRING UP
MY CHIEF DISTRESS WAS FOR WATER AND I WAS ONLY PREVENTED FROM TAKING A DRAUGHT FROM THE SEA BY REMEMBERING THE HORRIBLE CONSEQUENCES WHICH THUS HAVE RESULTED TO OTHERS WHO WERE SIMILARLY SITUATED WITH OURSELVES
IF SUCH WERE THE CASE AND I KNOW NOT WHAT ELSE TO IMAGINE DEATH TO JUDGE FROM THE POSITIONS OF THE BODIES MUST HAVE COME UPON THEM IN A MANNER AWFULLY SUDDEN AND OVERWHELMING
TO THE CITIZENS OF CHARLOTTESVILLE MISTER B FOR SOME YEARS PAST HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO NEURALGIA WHICH HAS OFTEN THREATENED TO TERMINATE FATALLY BUT THIS CAN BE REGARDED ONLY AS THE MEDIATE CAUSE OF HIS DECEASE
HE NEARLY FAINTED AS HE GAZED AND YET IT WAS BUT A MINIATURE PORTRAIT A MIRACULOUSLY ACCURATE ONE TO BE SURE OF HIS OWN VERY REMARKABLE FEATURES AT LEAST THIS WAS MY THOUGHT
IT IS POSSIBLE HOWEVER THAT MY COMPANIONS MAY HAVE ENTERTAINED THE SAME OPINION OF THEIR OWN CONDITION AS I DID OF MINE AND THAT I MAY HAVE UNWITTINGLY BEEN GUILTY OF THE SAME EXTRAVAGANCES AND IMBECILITIES AS THEMSELVES
THE NAME IS BEDLO WITH AN E ALL THE WORLD OVER AND I NEVER KNEW IT TO BE SPELT OTHERWISE IN MY LIFE THEN SAID I MUTTERINGLY AS I TURNED UPON MY HEEL THEN INDEED
I AM FORCED TO CLASS IT AMONG OTHER PHENOMENA IN THIS I AM NOT SURE THAT YOU ARE WRONG OBSERVED DOCTOR TEMPLETON BUT PROCEED
SUCH AS WE READ OF IN THE ARABIAN TALES BUT OF A CHARACTER EVEN MORE SINGULAR THAN ANY THERE DESCRIBED FROM MY POSITION WHICH WAS FAR ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE TOWN
THAN THAN THAN HERE I PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT IN THE EXPECTATION THAT MADAME LALANDE WOULD INTERRUPT ME BY SUPPLYING HER TRUE AGE
LONG EARNEST UNINTERRUPTED AND TOTALLY UNRESERVED SHE MADE ME RELATE MANY OF THE EARLIER PASSAGES OF MY LIFE AND LISTENED WITH BREATHLESS ATTENTION TO EVERY WORD OF THE NARRATIVE I CONCEALED NOTHING
WHICH PERHAPS I HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM FEELING BY THE IMMERSION I HAD UNDERGONE SINCE DRINKING IT THEY TALKED INCOHERENTLY AND ABOUT MATTERS UNCONNECTED WITH OUR CONDITION PETERS REPEATEDLY ASKING ME QUESTIONS ABOUT NANTUCKET
WITH HER AND WITH HER TERRIBLE CREW WENT ALL OUR GAY VISIONS OF DELIVERANCE AND JOY DELIBERATELY AS SHE WENT BY WE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE FOUND MEANS OF BOARDING HER
PARKER APPEARED TO BE SOMEWHAT MORE IN POSSESSION OF HIS SENSES THAN THE OTHERS AND I ENDEAVOURED BY EVERY MEANS IN MY POWER TO ROUSE HIM THINKING THAT A PLUNGE IN THE SEA WATER MIGHT HAVE A BENEFICIAL EFFECT I CONTRIVED TO FASTEN THE END OF A ROPE AROUND HIS BODY
THOROUGHLY MAD THROUGH THE ANGUISH OF OUR GRIEVOUS DISAPPOINTMENT AS OUR FIRST LOUD YELL OF TERROR BROKE FORTH IT WAS REPLIED TO BY SOMETHING FROM NEAR THE BOWSPRIT OF THE STRANGER
THERE HAD GROWN UP LITTLE BY LITTLE A VERY DISTINCT AND STRONGLY MARKED RAPPORT OR MAGNETIC RELATION I AM NOT PREPARED TO ASSERT HOWEVER THAT THIS RAPPORT EXTENDED BEYOND THE LIMITS OF THE SIMPLE SLEEP PRODUCING POWER
THE SOLITUDE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY VIRGIN
IN THIS YEAR WAS THE PORTRAIT TAKEN IT IS THE LIKENESS OF A DEAD FRIEND A MISTER OLDEB TO WHOM I BECAME MUCH ATTACHED AT CALCUTTA
THE INDIAN CITY OF BENARES UPON THE HOLY RIVER THE RIOTS THE COMBAT THE MASSACRE WERE THE ACTUAL EVENTS OF THE INSURRECTION OF CHEYTE SING
THE PROPOSITION WAS SERIOUSLY ENTERTAINED OF ATTEMPTING TO OVERTAKE HER BY SWIMMING I HAVE SINCE THIS PERIOD VAINLY ENDEAVOURED TO OBTAIN SOME CLEW TO THE HIDEOUS UNCERTAINTY WHICH ENVELOPED THE FATE OF THE STRANGER
THAT WE ALL TREMBLED FOR THE CONSEQUENCES TOWARD EVENING THE GALE STILL BLOWING WITH FURY A LARGE FIELD IN FRONT SEPARATED AND WE WERE ENABLED BY CARRYING A PRESS OF SAIL
SHE RESUMED WITH A CERTAIN EMPRESSMENT OF MANNER THAT RATHER SURPRISED ME EH BIEN MON AMI YOU HAVE EARNESTLY BESOUGHT OF ME A FAVOR WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN PLEASED TO DENOMINATE PRICELESS YOU HAVE DEMANDED OF ME MY HAND UPON THE MORROW
SLEEP WAS BROUGHT ABOUT ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY BY THE MERE VOLITION OF THE OPERATOR EVEN WHEN THE INVALID WAS UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE IT IS ONLY NOW IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE
THE DAY WORE ON IN THIS MANNER WHEN I SUDDENLY DISCOVERED A SAIL TO THE EASTWARD AND ON OUR LARBOARD BOW SHE APPEARED TO BE A LARGE SHIP AND WAS COMING NEARLY ATHWART US BEING PROBABLY TWELVE OR FIFTEEN MILES DISTANT
AND CAPTAIN GUY FANCIED THAT HE MADE OUT THE FIGURE OF A TORTOISE BUT THE RESEMBLANCE DID NOT STRIKE ME VERY FORCIBLY BESIDES THIS PROW IF SUCH IT WERE WE FOUND NO OTHER TOKEN THAT ANY LIVING CREATURE HAD EVER BEEN HERE BEFORE
AUDIBLE OR PALPABLE PRESENCE THE CROWD HAD DEPARTED THE TUMULT HAD CEASED THE CITY WAS IN COMPARATIVE REPOSE BENEATH ME LAY MY CORPSE
TOGETHER WITH A GREAT VARIETY OF OCEANIC BIRDS WHALES ARE ALSO PLENTY IN THEIR VICINITY OWING TO THE EASE WITH WHICH THESE VARIOUS ANIMALS WERE HERE FORMERLY TAKEN THE GROUP HAS BEEN MUCH VISITED SINCE ITS DISCOVERY
AND THESE SENSES NOW BROUGHT TO MY SOUL A WORLD OF NOVEL AND SINGULAR SENSATION THE HEAT BECAME ALL AT ONCE INTOLERABLE A STRANGE ODOR LOADED THE BREEZE A LOW CONTINUOUS MURMUR
THE PANGS OF HUNGER AND THIRST THEN RETURNED ABSORBING ALL OTHER CARES AND CONSIDERATIONS NOTHING HOWEVER COULD BE DONE UNTIL THE MORNING AND SECURING OURSELVES AS WELL AS POSSIBLE WE ENDEAVOURED TO SNATCH A LITTLE REPOSE
WE PASSED THE REMAINDER OF THIS NIGHT IN A STATE OF THE MOST INTENSE MENTAL AND BODILY ANGUISH THAT CAN POSSIBLY BE IMAGINED THE MORNING OF THE SIXTEENTH AT LENGTH DAWNED AND WE LOOKED EAGERLY AROUND THE HORIZON FOR RELIEF
WE AT LENGTH CAME TO A PASSAGE OF ABOUT A MILE IN WIDTH
SEVERAL SHOTS WERE FIRED IN QUICK SUCCESSION THE MOST OF WHICH TOOK EFFECT APPARENTLY IN THE HEAD AND BODY NOTHING DISCOURAGED HOWEVER THE MONSTER THREW HIMSELF FROM THE ICE
BESIDES UPON THE BACK OF THE TRINKET YOU MAY DISCOVER PERHAPS THE VERY INFORMATION YOU SEEM TO DESIRE IT IS NOW TO BE SURE GROWING RATHER DARK BUT YOU CAN EXAMINE IT AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE MORNING IN THE MEANTIME YOU SHALL BE MY ESCORT HOME TO NIGHT
UPON EACH OF THESE OCCASIONS WE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED AT THE TOP OF OUR VOICES WHEN THE STRANGER WOULD APPEAR TO CHANGE FOR A MOMENT HER INTENTION AND AGAIN HOLD ON TOWARD US THIS SINGULAR CONDUCT BEING REPEATED TWO OR THREE TIMES
IN WHICH YOU FANCIED THESE THINGS AMID THE HILLS I WAS ENGAGED IN DETAILING THEM UPON PAPER HERE AT HOME IN ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THIS CONVERSATION THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS APPEARED
AND NOT ALTOGETHER HORRORLESS CURIOSITY RESPECTING YOURSELF IN YOUR DETAIL OF THE VISION WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO YOU AMID THE HILLS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED
THIS IS A MATTER WHICH CANNOT BE DETERMINED ABOUT NOON PARKER DECLARED THAT HE SAW LAND OFF THE LARBOARD QUARTER AND IT WAS WITH THE UTMOST DIFFICULTY I COULD RESTRAIN HIM FROM PLUNGING INTO THE SEA WITH THE VIEW OF SWIMMING TOWARD IT
THIS PATH WAS EXCESSIVELY SINUOUS AND AS THE SUN COULD NOT BE SEEN I SOON LOST ALL IDEA OF THE DIRECTION IN WHICH I JOURNEYED IN THE MEANTIME THE MORPHINE HAD ITS CUSTOMARY EFFECT
THAT OF ENDUING ALL THE EXTERNAL WORLD WITH AN INTENSITY OF INTEREST IN THE QUIVERING OF A LEAF IN THE HUE OF A BLADE OF GRASS IN THE SHAPE OF A TREFOIL IN THE HUMMING OF A BEE
I SEATED MYSELF BENEATH A TREE PRESENTLY THERE CAME A FEEBLE GLEAM OF SUNSHINE AND THE SHADOW OF THE LEAVES OF THE TREE FELL FAINTLY BUT DEFINITELY UPON THE GRASS
DOCTOR TEMPLETON HAD BEEN A TRAVELLER IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS AND AT PARIS HAD BECOME A CONVERT IN GREAT MEASURE TO THE DOCTRINES OF MESMER IT WAS ALTOGETHER BY MEANS OF MAGNETIC REMEDIES
FIRST OF DELIGHT AND THEN OF HORROR THAN EVEN ANY OF THE THOUSAND CHANCES WHICH AFTERWARD BEFELL ME IN NINE LONG YEARS CROWDED WITH EVENTS OF THE MOST STARTLING AND IN MANY CASES OF THE MOST UNCONCEIVED AND UNCONCEIVABLE CHARACTER
THE PATIENT DIED WHEN IT APPEARED THAT IN THE JAR CONTAINING THE LEECHES HAD BEEN INTRODUCED BY ACCIDENT ONE OF THE VENOMOUS VERMICULAR SANGSUES WHICH ARE NOW AND THEN FOUND IN THE NEIGHBORING PONDS
AND IN CONCLUSION OF THE DISAGREEABLE AND INCONVENIENT BUT HITHERTO CAREFULLY CONCEALED WEAKNESS OF MY EYES UPON THIS LATTER POINT SAID MADAME LALANDE LAUGHINGLY YOU HAVE BEEN SURELY INJUDICIOUS IN COMING TO CONFESSION
WE SAW NEVERTHELESS MUCH OPEN WATER TO THE SOUTHWARD AND FELT NO DOUBT OF BEING ABLE TO REACH IT EVENTUALLY
THIS DAY WE FOUND OURSELVES COMPLETELY HEMMED IN BY THE ICE AND OUR PROSPECTS LOOKED CHEERLESS INDEED
THE DISTORTION OF COUNTENANCE WAS ABSOLUTELY FRIGHTFUL INDEED IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE STIMULUS IN THE EMPTY STATE OF THEIR STOMACHS HAD TAKEN INSTANT AND VIOLENT EFFECT AND THAT THEY WERE ALL EXCEEDINGLY INTOXICATED
BUT OF AN INTRINSIC LUSTRE AS DOES A CANDLE OR THE SUN YET THEIR ORDINARY CONDITION WAS SO TOTALLY VAPID FILMY
USING A LARGE IRON POT CAPABLE OF HOLDING TWENTY GALLONS AND A LINE OF TWO HUNDRED FATHOMS WE FOUND THE CURRENT SETTING TO THE NORTH ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE PER HOUR THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR WAS NOW ABOUT THIRTY THREE HERE
BUT BROUGHT UP NOTHING ELSE DURING THE NIGHT PARKER AND PETERS OCCUPIED THEMSELVES BY TURNS IN THE SAME MANNER BUT NOTHING COMING TO HAND WE NOW GAVE UP THIS ATTEMPT IN DESPAIR CONCLUDING THAT WE WERE EXHAUSTING OURSELVES IN VAIN
WHOM HE HAD FIRST ENCOUNTERED AT SARATOGA AND FROM WHOSE ATTENTION WHILE THERE HE EITHER RECEIVED OR FANCIED THAT HE RECEIVED GREAT BENEFIT THE RESULT WAS THAT BEDLOE WHO WAS WEALTHY
WITH THE ARROW IN MY TEMPLE THE WHOLE HEAD GREATLY SWOLLEN AND DISFIGURED BUT ALL THESE THINGS I FELT NOT SAW I TOOK INTEREST IN NOTHING EVEN THE CORPSE SEEMED A MATTER IN WHICH I HAD NO CONCERN
FOR THIS SERVICE PARKER IMMEDIATELY VOLUNTEERED BUT AFTER MAKING THREE INEFFECTUAL EFFORTS FOUND THAT HE COULD NEVER EVEN SUCCEED IN GETTING NEAR THE DOOR THE CONDITION OF AUGUSTUS'S WOUNDED ARM RENDERED IT USELESS FOR HIM TO ATTEMPT GOING DOWN
TOUCHED AT THE LARGEST OF THE ISLANDS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFRESHMENT HE PLANTED ONIONS POTATOES CABBAGES AND A GREAT MANY OTHER VEGETABLES
AND UNABLE TO ARTICULATE A SYLLABLE
I LOOKED UPWARD AND THE EYES OF AUGUSTUS MET MY OWN WITH A DEGREE OF INTENSE AND EAGER MEANING WHICH IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT ME TO MY SENSES I SPRANG FORWARD QUICKLY
REACHED AND ENTERED THE CITY HERE ALL WAS THE WILDEST TUMULT AND CONTENTION
WE PICKED UP NEAR THE SHORE HALF BURIED IN A PILE OF LOOSE STONES A PIECE OF WOOD WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE FORMED THE PROW OF A CANOE THERE HAD BEEN EVIDENTLY SOME ATTEMPT AT CARVING UPON IT
WHEN THEY WOULD SPRING UPON THEIR FEET IN A MOMENTARY FLASH OF VIGOUR AND SPEAK FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF THEIR PROSPECTS IN A MANNER ALTOGETHER RATIONAL ALTHOUGH FULL OF THE MOST INTENSE DESPAIR
LIKE THAT ARISING FROM A FULL BUT GENTLY FLOWING RIVER CAME TO MY EARS INTERMINGLED WITH THE PECULIAR HUM OF MULTITUDINOUS HUMAN VOICES WHILE I LISTENED IN AN EXTREMITY OF ASTONISHMENT
IN THE CHARACTER OF AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS SHE TOOK MY ARM AND I ATTENDED HER HOME THE MANSION WAS QUITE A FINE ONE AND I BELIEVE FURNISHED IN GOOD TASTE OF THIS LATTER POINT HOWEVER I AM SCARCELY QUALIFIED TO JUDGE
AND I RELATE THEM IT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD PRECISELY AS THEY APPEARED TO US THE BRIG CAME ON SLOWLY AND NOW MORE STEADILY THAN BEFORE AND I CANNOT SPEAK CALMLY OF THIS EVENT
AND RESTRAINED BY THEIR PRESENCE ALONE FROM THROWING MYSELF IMPETUOUSLY AT HER FEET NAME IT MY BELOVED MY EUGENIE MY OWN NAME IT BUT ALAS IT IS ALREADY YIELDED ERE NAMED
ALTHOUGH SOUND THAN I HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN TEETH IN A HUMAN HEAD THE EXPRESSION OF HIS SMILE HOWEVER WAS BY NO MEANS UNPLEASING AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED BUT IT HAD NO VARIATION WHATEVER
THIS LATTER ARGUMENT SEEMED FINALLY TO SOFTEN THE RIGOR OF HER DETERMINATION SHE RELENTED BUT THERE WAS YET AN OBSTACLE SHE SAID WHICH SHE FELT ASSURED I HAD NOT PROPERLY CONSIDERED
AS WELL AS BY WHAT I CONSIDERED A SURE PROSPECT OF DELIVERANCE THAT I COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM JOINING IN WITH THEIR MADNESS AND GAVE WAY TO THE IMPULSES OF MY GRATITUDE AND ECSTASY BY LYING AND ROLLING ON THE DECK
AMID THE MILLION OF BLACK AND YELLOW MEN TURBANED AND ROBED AND OF FLOWING BEARD THERE ROAMED A COUNTLESS MULTITUDE OF HOLY FILLETED BULLS
DESCENDED INTO THE CITY ON MY WAY I FELL IN WITH AN IMMENSE POPULACE CROWDING THROUGH EVERY AVENUE ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND EXHIBITING IN EVERY ACTION THE WILDEST EXCITEMENT
HERE STOOPING I BATHED MY HANDS AND MY HEAD AND NECK THIS SEEMED TO DISSIPATE THE EQUIVOCAL SENSATIONS WHICH HAD HITHERTO ANNOYED ME
IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS POINT I WAS URGED PARTLY AND PERHAPS PRINCIPALLY BY A REGRETFUL MEMORY OF THE DECEASED
THE THERMOMETER BEING AS HIGH AS FIFTY ONE AT THIS PERIOD NOT A PARTICLE OF ICE WAS TO BE DISCOVERED ALL HANDS ON BOARD NOW FELT CERTAIN OF ATTAINING THE POLE
WHICH TOOK PLACE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY WHEN HASTINGS WAS PUT IN IMMINENT PERIL OF HIS LIFE THE MAN ESCAPING BY THE STRING OF TURBANS WAS CHEYTE SING HIMSELF
BUT OF THIS HE TOOK LITTLE OR NO NOTICE CONTINUING HIS ODD SMILES AND GESTICULATIONS
AND THY ROBE DE CHAMBRE IS A SHROUD OF NO SCANTY DIMENSIONS SIR REPLIED THE DUC I AM NOT TO BE INSULTED WITH IMPUNITY SIR I SHALL TAKE THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY OF AVENGING THIS INSULT
I STARTED TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE PEW AND PERCEIVED BY THE ANIMATED LOOKS OF THE DIVINE THAT THE WRATH WHICH HAD NEARLY PROVED FATAL TO THE PULPIT HAD BEEN EXCITED BY THE WHISPERS OF THE LADY AND MYSELF
THERE THE DARK TALL STATURES OF THE PRINCES METZENGERSTEIN THEIR MUSCULAR WAR COURSERS PLUNGING OVER THE CARCASSES OF FALLEN FOES STARTLED THE STEADIEST NERVES WITH THEIR VIGOROUS EXPRESSION
GREAT PITY PON MY HONOR WONDERFULLY INVENTIVE AGE
UNTIL LATELY THE BARE SUPPOSITION OF SUCH A THING WAS CONSIDERED HERETICAL FROM THE REMOTEST PERIOD OF ANTIQUITY TO WHICH THE ARCHIVES HAVE REFERENCE THE HOURS HAVE BEEN REGULARLY STRUCK BY THE BIG BELL
BY HER SIDE THERE STANDS A FAT TABBY CAT WITH A GILT TOY REPEATER TIED TO ITS TAIL WHICH THE BOYS HAVE THERE FASTENED BY WAY OF A QUIZ THE BOYS THEMSELVES ARE ALL THREE OF THEM IN THE GARDEN ATTENDING THE PIG THEY ARE EACH TWO FEET IN HEIGHT
WITH A COMPULSORY EXERTION HE DIVERTED HIS ATTENTION TO THE GLARE OF RUDDY LIGHT THROWN FULL BY THE FLAMING STABLES UPON THE WINDOWS OF THE APARTMENT THE ACTION HOWEVER WAS BUT MOMENTARY HIS GAZE RETURNED MECHANICALLY TO THE WALL
SAID MISS ARABELLA AS SHE AT LENGTH COMPREHENDED THE PURPORT OF MY QUERY
WAS NOW EXTENDED AT FULL LENGTH IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BARON THE EYES BEFORE INVISIBLE NOW WORE AN ENERGETIC AND HUMAN EXPRESSION WHILE THEY GLEAMED WITH A FIERY AND UNUSUAL RED
TO ASSURE HIM THAT THE EXPLANATION OFFERED WAS OF THE FULLEST THE MOST HONORABLE AND THE MOST UNEQUIVOCALLY SATISFACTORY NATURE SOMEWHAT AMAZED AT ALL THIS I MADE MY RETREAT TO THE BARON
LO GLEAMS THE MOST GHASTLY OF ALL FIRES
A VERY SWEET AND INTELLIGENT GIRL WHO IN A FEW HURRIED WORDS MADE US ACQUAINTED MISSUS WYATT HAD BEEN CLOSELY VEILED AND WHEN SHE RAISED HER VEIL IN ACKNOWLEDGING MY BOW
NO SIR I SHALL NOT STRIP WHO ARE YOU PRAY THAT I DUC DE L'OMELETTE PRINCE DE FOIE GRAS JUST COME OF AGE AUTHOR OF THE MAZURKIAD AND MEMBER OF THE ACADEMY SHOULD DIVEST MYSELF AT YOUR BIDDING
MY OLD INQUISITIVENESS NOW RETURNED THERE WAS NO SERVANT THAT WAS A SETTLED POINT I LOOKED THEREFORE FOR THE EXTRA BAGGAGE AFTER SOME DELAY A CART ARRIVED AT THE WHARF
HE SECURES ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF INTEREST OR DESIGN WHILE RELIEVING HIS WORK OF ALL THE HARSHNESS AND TECHNICALITY OF ART
SAID MY FRIEND HERE DROPPING HIS VOICE EXCESSIVELY LOW AND THRILLING ME WITH THE MYSTERY OF HIS TONE A DOWNRIGHT FIRE EATER AND NO MISTAKE SHOWED THAT I SHOULD SAY
THE SPACE PASSED OVER IN A SINGLE LEAP HAD BEEN ACCURATELY MEASURED AND WAS FOUND TO EXCEED BY AN ASTOUNDING DIFFERENCE THE WILDEST EXPECTATIONS OF THE MOST IMAGINATIVE
TO HOLD COMMUNICATION WITH ANY PERSON ON BOARD MISSUS WYATT HERSELF WAS FAR MORE AGREEABLE THAT IS TO SAY SHE WAS CHATTY AND TO BE CHATTY IS NO SLIGHT RECOMMENDATION AT SEA
WHERE I FOUND MYSELF ESTABLISHED ONE SUNDAY JUST AT SERMON TIME NOT ONLY IN THE PEW BUT BY THE SIDE OF THAT WORTHY AND COMMUNICATIVE LITTLE FRIEND OF MINE MISS TABITHA T
HE SPOKE UPON THIS TOPIC WITH WARMTH REGARDING NOT SO MUCH ITS IMMEDIATE OR OBVIOUS IMPORTANCE WHICH IS LITTLE
I'LL HAVE NONE O THEM NED KNOWLES THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG WAS A NOBLE HUNGARIAN FAMILY EVERY MEMBER OF WHICH AT LEAST AS FAR BACK INTO ANTIQUITY AS ANY CERTAIN RECORDS EXTEND
IS A PROPOSITION BETTER SUITED TO THE GROVELLING APPREHENSION OF THE HERD THAN TO THE FERVID DREAMS OF THE MAN OF GENIUS THE MERIT SUGGESTED IS AT BEST NEGATIVE
IT WAS EVIDENT HOWEVER THAT JUST AT THIS MOMENT THE FELLOW IN THE STEEPLE WAS DOING SOMETHING THAT HE HAD NO BUSINESS TO DO WITH THE CLOCK BUT AS IT NOW BEGAN TO STRIKE
RULE APPLIES BUT TO THE EXCELLENCES OF AVOIDANCE TO THE VIRTUES WHICH DENY OR REFRAIN BEYOND THESE THE CRITICAL ART CAN BUT SUGGEST
VOTTEIMITTIS QUASI UND BLEITZIZ BLEITZIZ OBSOL PRO BLITZEN THIS DERIVATIVE TO SAY THE TRUTH IS STILL COUNTENANCED BY SOME TRACES OF THE ELECTRIC FLUID EVIDENT ON THE SUMMIT OF THE STEEPLE OF THE HOUSE OF THE TOWN COUNCIL
TO HIS EXTREME HORROR AND ASTONISHMENT THE HEAD OF THE GIGANTIC STEED HAD IN THE MEANTIME ALTERED ITS POSITION THE NECK OF THE ANIMAL BEFORE ARCHED AS IF IN COMPASSION OVER THE PROSTRATE BODY OF ITS LORD
I CAN RECOMMEND YOU TO HIM WITH CONFIDENCE HERE THE GENERAL BOWED AND ASSURE YOU THAT I HAVE THE GREATEST PLEASURE IN SO DOING I ACKNOWLEDGED HIS KINDNESS IN MY BEST MANNER
AND THE UNANIMOUS OPINION OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD ADDED THE CRIME OF THE INCENDIARY TO THE ALREADY HIDEOUS LIST OF THE BARON'S MISDEMEANORS AND ENORMITIES
THOMPSON TO BE SURE IS NOT MY NAME BUT IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT I LEFT GENERAL SMITH WITH A HEIGHTENED INTEREST IN THE MAN WITH AN EXALTED OPINION OF HIS CONVERSATIONAL POWERS
WHILE THE NECESSITY OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TO YOUR REAL PERSON WILL BE OBVIATED WITH THESE WORDS HE HURLED THE DECANTER FULL OF WINE AGAINST THE MIRROR WHICH HUNG DIRECTLY OPPOSITE HERMANN
FOR THE SISTERS HOWEVER I COULD MAKE NO EXCUSE THEY SECLUDED THEMSELVES IN THEIR STATEROOMS DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE PASSAGE AND ABSOLUTELY REFUSED ALTHOUGH I REPEATEDLY URGED THEM
FROM WHICH AN ARTISTICAL EYE LOOKING STEADILY WILL NOT FIND MATTER OF OFFENCE IN WHAT IS TECHNICALLY TERMED THE COMPOSITION OF A NATURAL LANDSCAPE AND YET HOW UNINTELLIGIBLE IS THIS
NO DEFINITION HAD SPOKEN OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER AS OF THE POET YET MY FRIEND COULD NOT FAIL TO PERCEIVE THAT THE CREATION OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN OFFERED TO THE TRUE MUSE THE MOST MAGNIFICENT OF OPPORTUNITIES
ORNAMENTED WITH PURPLE AND YELLOW RIBBONS HER DRESS IS OF ORANGE COLORED LINSEY WOOLSEY MADE VERY FULL BEHIND AND VERY SHORT IN THE WAIST AND INDEED VERY SHORT IN OTHER RESPECTS NOT REACHING BELOW THE MIDDLE OF HER LEG THIS IS SOMEWHAT THICK AND SO ARE HER ANKLES
NOR WAS I GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THE NATURE OF HIS DECISION IN THE WIDEST AND NOBLEST SENSE HE WAS A POET HE COMPREHENDED MOREOVER THE TRUE CHARACTER THE AUGUST AIMS
A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS PARTLY PLEASING TO THE EYE BY THE SHOW OF ORDER AND DESIGN AND PARTLY MORAL A TERRACE
WHEREIN CONSULT ALSO MARGINAL NOTES IN THE AUTOGRAPH OF STUFFUNDPUFF
IT WANTED FIVE MINUTES OF NOON ON THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY WHEN THERE APPEARED A VERY ODD LOOKING OBJECT ON THE SUMMIT OF THE RIDGE OF THE EASTWARD SUCH AN OCCURRENCE OF COURSE ATTRACTED UNIVERSAL ATTENTION AND EVERY LITTLE OLD GENTLEMAN WHO SAT IN A LEATHER BOTTOMED ARM CHAIR
THIS IS A WONDERFULLY INVENTIVE AGE HORRID AFFAIR THAT A BLOODY SET OF WRETCHES THOSE KICKAPOOS FOUGHT LIKE A HERO PRODIGIES OF VALOR IMMORTAL RENOWN SMITH
THE CHANCES TRUE DESPERATE BUT SCARCELY MORE DESPERATE THAN THE DUC BESIDES WAS HE NOT IN THE SECRET
HE HAS HIMSELF PERISHED MISERABLY IN THE FLAMES
IN THE PREVALENCE OF A BEAUTIFUL HARMONY AND ORDER THAN IN THE CREATION OF ANY SPECIAL WONDERS OR MIRACLES THE ARTIFICIAL STYLE HAS AS MANY VARIETIES AS THERE ARE DIFFERENT TASTES TO GRATIFY
MUSSULMAN NEVER DREAMED OF SUCH WHEN DRUGGED WITH OPIUM HE HAS TOTTERED TO A BED OF POPPIES HIS BACK TO THE FLOWERS AND HIS FACE TO THE GOD APOLLO
SIR YOU SHALL HEAR FROM ME IN THE MEANTIME AU REVOIR AND THE DUC WAS BOWING HIMSELF OUT OF THE SATANIC PRESENCE WHEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED AND BROUGHT BACK BY A GENTLEMAN IN WAITING
ENTERING AT THE SAME TIME INTO PARTICULARS OF A MINUTE AND CIRCUMSTANTIAL CHARACTER BUT FROM THE LOW TONE OF VOICE IN WHICH THESE LATTER WERE COMMUNICATED NOTHING ESCAPED TO GRATIFY THE EXCITED CURIOSITY OF THE EQUERRIES THE YOUNG FREDERICK
A BRISK TETE A TETE SMITH SAID SHE IN REPLY TO MY VERY EARNEST INQUIRY SMITH WHY NOT GENERAL JOHN A B C BLESS ME I THOUGHT YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT HIM
YOU ARE MISTAKEN MY LORD THE HORSE AS I THINK WE MENTIONED IS NOT FROM THE STABLES OF THE COUNT IF SUCH HAD BEEN THE CASE WE KNOW OUR DUTY BETTER THAN TO BRING HIM INTO THE PRESENCE OF A NOBLE OF YOUR FAMILY TRUE OBSERVED THE BARON DRYLY
LET THIS EMENDATION BE SUBMITTED TO EVERY ARTIST IN THE WORLD BY EACH WILL ITS NECESSITY BE ADMITTED AND EVEN FAR MORE THAN THIS IN REMEDY OF THE DEFECTIVE COMPOSITION
HE RATHER THOUGHT THE INDEPENDENCE WOULD NOT SAIL FOR A DAY OR TWO AND THAT WHEN ALL WAS READY HE WOULD SEND UP AND LET ME KNOW THIS I THOUGHT STRANGE FOR THERE WAS A STIFF SOUTHERLY BREEZE BUT AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT HE BECAME NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER IN PURSUANCE OF AN IDEA OF HIS WHICH I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THE IDEA THAT IN THE CONTEMPT OF AMBITION LAY ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF HAPPINESS ON EARTH
THE PASSENGERS WERE CONSEQUENTLY IN HIGH SPIRITS AND DISPOSED TO BE SOCIAL I MUST EXCEPT HOWEVER WYATT AND HIS SISTERS WHO BEHAVED STIFFLY AND I COULD NOT HELP THINKING
WHICH UPON EACH SUCH FAILURE OF HIS PRAISE WORTHY ENDEAVORS WOULD SUFFUSE EVERY LINEAMENT OF HIS COUNTENANCE LEFT NOT THE SLIGHTEST ROOM FOR DOUBT OF HIS SINCERITY IN THE BOSOMS OF EVEN HIS MOST SKEPTICAL COMPANIONS
THREW A PLACE IN HIS REGARD AND HERE WITH SOMEWHAT MORE DIFFICULTY A PARTIAL INSIGHT INTO HIS MENTAL CONFORMATION IN LATER DAYS THIS INSIGHT GREW MORE CLEAR
WITH BOTH HANDS MAKING A GREAT SHOW THE NINCOMPOOP OF PLAYING JUDY O'FLANNAGAN AND PADDY O'RAFFERTY AFFAIRS BEING THUS MISERABLY SITUATED I LEFT THE PLACE IN DISGUST AND NOW APPEAL FOR AID TO ALL LOVERS OF CORRECT TIME AND FINE KRAUT
AFTER SUCH A FASHION THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE ANY EVEN THE MOST COMPLEX COMBINATION OF HUMAN FEATURES CONVEYING SO ENTIRELY AND SO SINGLY THE IDEA OF UNMITIGATED GRAVITY
THEY WERE OF A DEEP HAZEL EXCEEDINGLY LARGE AND LUSTROUS
WAS SEEN LEAPING WITH AN IMPETUOSITY WHICH OUTSTRIPPED THE VERY DEMON OF THE TEMPEST THE CAREER OF THE HORSEMAN WAS INDISPUTABLY ON HIS OWN PART UNCONTROLLABLE
THEIR BEAUTY WAS GRECIAN THEIR DEFORMITY EGYPTIAN
THE TRUMP IS TURNED IT IS IT IS THE KING NO IT WAS THE QUEEN
AND MANY A BURGHER WHO BEHELD HIM THAT DAY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A TRIFLE FOR A PEEP BENEATH THE WHITE CAMBRIC HANDKERCHIEF WHICH HUNG SO OBTRUSIVELY FROM THE POCKET OF HIS SWALLOW TAILED COAT BUT WHAT MAINLY OCCASIONED A RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION WAS THAT THE SCOUNDRELLY POPINJAY
THEN THE SENTIMENT OF INTEREST IS PRESERVED WHILE THE ART IS MADE TO ASSUME THE AIR OF AN INTERMEDIATE OR SECONDARY NATURE A NATURE WHICH IS NOT GOD NOR AN EMANATION OF GOD
SMITH INQUIRED MIRANDA MUSINGLY GOD BLESS ME DID YOU EVER BEHOLD A FINER FIGURE NEVER MADAM BUT DO TELL ME OR SO INIMITABLE GRACE
SHAMEFUL DEBAUCHERIES FLAGRANT TREACHERIES UNHEARD OF ATROCITIES GAVE HIS TREMBLING VASSALS QUICKLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT NO SERVILE SUBMISSION ON THEIR PART NO PUNCTILIOS OF CONSCIENCE ON HIS OWN
WITH A FINE MARGIN AND BOUND BY DEROME
HE WAS A REMARKABLE MAN A VERY REMARKABLE MAN INDEED ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE MEN OF THE AGE HE WAS AN ESPECIAL FAVORITE TOO WITH THE LADIES
WHICH GOES TO THE CONFORMATION OF A PROPERLY PROPORTIONED CALF I WISH TO GOD MY YOUNG AND TALENTED FRIEND CHIPONCHIPINO THE SCULPTOR HAD BUT SEEN THE LEGS OF BREVET BRIGADIER GENERAL JOHN A B C SMITH
NUMEROUS INVITATIONS ON THE PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR A LONG TIME HOWEVER PERIODICALLY CAME IN WILL THE BARON HONOR OUR FESTIVALS WITH HIS PRESENCE WILL THE BARON JOIN US IN A HUNTING OF THE BOAR
NO O O SAID HE LOOKING WISE
THE RASCAL BOUNCED AS I SAY RIGHT INTO THE MIDST OF THEM GAVE A CHASSEZ HERE AND A BALANCEZ THERE
HE DESCENDED THE HILLS AT A GREAT RATE SO THAT EVERY BODY HAD SOON A GOOD LOOK AT HIM HE WAS REALLY THE MOST FINICKY LITTLE PERSONAGE THAT HAD EVER BEEN SEEN IN VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS HIS COUNTENANCE WAS OF A DARK SNUFF COLOR
SHOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN SETTING AND KEEPING AT VARIANCE TWO FAMILIES ALREADY PREDISPOSED TO QUARREL BY EVERY INSTIGATION OF HEREDITARY JEALOUSY THE PROPHECY SEEMED TO IMPLY IF IT IMPLIED ANYTHING
WHO REMAINED IN ATTENDANCE DURING MY VISIT AS I ENTERED THE CHAMBER I LOOKED ABOUT OF COURSE FOR THE OCCUPANT BUT DID NOT IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVE HIM
WHOSE NAME I HAVE UNACCOUNTABLY FORGOTTEN THE TRUTH IS THAT THE INTRODUCTION WAS ATTENDED UPON MY PART WITH A DEGREE OF ANXIOUS EMBARRASSMENT WHICH OPERATED TO PREVENT ANY DEFINITE IMPRESSIONS OF EITHER TIME OR PLACE
IN EXPLICIT TERMS A SOLUTION OF THIS ABOMINABLE PIECE OF MYSTERY HERE AT LEAST THERE SHOULD BE NO CHANCE FOR EQUIVOCATION I WOULD BE PLAIN POSITIVE PEREMPTORY AS SHORT AS PIE CRUST
THEY HAVE THREE CORNERED COCKED HATS PURPLE WAISTCOATS REACHING DOWN TO THEIR THIGHS BUCKSKIN KNEE BREECHES RED STOCKINGS HEAVY SHOES WITH BIG SILVER BUCKLES LONG SURTOUT COATS WITH LARGE BUTTONS OF MOTHER OF PEARL EACH TOO HAS A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH
I DESIGN HERE TO GIVE A HISTORY OF THE CALAMITOUS EVENTS WHICH HAVE SO LATELY OCCURRED WITHIN ITS LIMITS NO ONE WHO KNOWS ME WILL DOUBT THAT THE DUTY THUS SELF IMPOSED WILL BE EXECUTED TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY WITH ALL THAT RIGID IMPARTIALITY ALL THAT CAUTIOUS EXAMINATION INTO FACTS
WERE SO EXCEEDINGLY NARROW AS TO BE INSUFFICIENT FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON STILL I COULD NOT COMPREHEND WHY THERE WERE THREE STATE ROOMS FOR THESE FOUR PERSONS I WAS JUST AT THAT EPOCH
AND I RESOLVED TO CALL AT ONCE UPON MY PARTICULAR FRIEND MISTER THEODORE SINIVATE FOR I KNEW THAT HERE AT LEAST I SHOULD GET SOMETHING LIKE DEFINITE INFORMATION SMITH
DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE THE REMOTEST IDEA IN THE WORLD OF SUCH A THING AS KEEPING TIME IN HIS STEPS THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THE BOROUGH HAD SCARCELY A CHANCE HOWEVER TO GET THEIR EYES THOROUGHLY OPEN WHEN JUST AS IT WANTED HALF A MINUTE OF NOON
NEVER UPON MY WORD BUT PRAY INFORM ME OR SO JUST AN APPRECIATION OF STAGE EFFECT
HIS INTELLECT WAS OF THAT ORDER TO WHICH THE ATTAINMENT OF KNOWLEDGE IS LESS A LABOR THAN A NECESSITY AND AN INTUITION HIS FAMILY WAS ONE OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS OF THE EMPIRE HIS BRIDE WAS THE LOVELIEST AND MOST DEVOTED OF WOMEN
TOUCHING THE DERIVATION OF THE NAME VONDERVOTTEIMITTISS I CONFESS MYSELF WITH SORROW EQUALLY AT FAULT AMONG A MULTITUDE OF OPINIONS UPON THIS DELICATE POINT SOME ACUTE SOME LEARNED SOME SUFFICIENTLY THE REVERSE
WHEN THE BIG BUGABOO RAMMED ME DOWN WITH THE BUTT END OF HIS RIFLE BUTT END RAM DOWN MY EYE O YES BY THE BY MY EYE HERE
WENT UP TO HIS MASTER OPENED HIS MOUTH WITH THE KNOWING AIR OF A HORSE JOCKEY AND ADJUSTED THEREIN A SOMEWHAT SINGULAR LOOKING MACHINE IN A VERY DEXTEROUS MANNER THAT I COULD NOT ALTOGETHER COMPREHEND
MINUTELY AND SAGACIOUSLY DIRECTING THE VARIOUS MODES OF INVESTMENT HE BEQUEATHED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO THE NEAREST OF BLOOD BEARING THE NAME ELLISON WHO SHOULD BE ALIVE AT THE END OF THE HUNDRED YEARS
DECIDEDLY APPROBATORY THE CORNERS OF THE ROOM WERE ROUNDED INTO NICHES THREE OF THESE WERE FILLED WITH STATUES OF GIGANTIC PROPORTIONS
FOR WHOSE SCRUTINY AND FOR WHOSE REFINED APPRECIATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL MORE ESPECIALLY THAN FOR OUR OWN HAD BEEN SET IN ORDER BY GOD THE GREAT LANDSCAPE GARDEN OF THE WHOLE EARTH IN THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSION
ELLISON THIS GENTLEMEN HAD AMASSED A PRINCELY FORTUNE AND HAVING NO VERY IMMEDIATE CONNEXIONS CONCEIVED THE WHIM OF SUFFERING HIS WEALTH TO ACCUMULATE FOR A CENTURY AFTER HIS DECEASE
OR AT LEAST A PICTURE FOR I KNEW HE HAD BEEN FOR SEVERAL WEEKS IN CONFERENCE WITH NICOLINO AND NOW HERE WAS A BOX WHICH FROM ITS SHAPE COULD POSSIBLY CONTAIN NOTHING IN THE WORLD
YET WHICH IF ATTAINED WOULD LEND A CHARM TO THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN IMMEASURABLY SURPASSING THAT WHICH A MERELY HUMAN INTEREST COULD BESTOW
I SAW JEW PEDLARS WITH HAWK EYES FLASHING FROM COUNTENANCES WHOSE EVERY OTHER FEATURE WORE ONLY AN EXPRESSION OF ABJECT HUMILITY STURDY PROFESSIONAL STREET BEGGARS SCOWLING UPON MENDICANTS OF A BETTER STAMP WHOM DESPAIR ALONE HAD DRIVEN FORTH INTO THE NIGHT FOR CHARITY
WOMEN OF THE TOWN OF ALL KINDS AND OF ALL AGES THE UNEQUIVOCAL BEAUTY IN THE PRIME OF HER WOMANHOOD PUTTING ONE IN MIND OF THE STATUE IN LUCIAN WITH THE SURFACE OF PARIAN MARBLE AND THE INTERIOR FILLED WITH FILTH
WITH THEIR MEANING MELT TO FANTASIES WITH NONE O SHE WAS WORTHY OF ALL LOVE LOVE AS IN INFANCY WAS MINE TWAS SUCH AS ANGEL MINDS ABOVE MIGHT ENVY
FAREWELL FOR I HAVE WON THE EARTH WHEN HOPE THE EAGLE THAT TOWER'D COULD SEE NO CLIFF BEYOND HIM IN THE SKY HIS PINIONS WERE BENT DROOPINGLY AND HOMEWARD TURN'D HIS SOFTEN'D EYE TWAS SUNSET
SHADOWS AND A MORE SHADOWY LIGHT PARTED UPON THEIR MISTY WINGS AND SO CONFUSEDLY BECAME THINE IMAGE AND A NAME A NAME TWO SEPARATE YET MOST INTIMATE THINGS
THERE IS A GROWING DESIRE TO OVERRATE THEM THE OLD ENGLISH MUSE WAS FRANK GUILELESS SINCERE AND ALTHOUGH VERY LEARNED STILL LEARNED WITHOUT ART
MY PASSIONS FROM THAT HAPLESS HOUR USURP'D A TYRANNY WHICH MEN HAVE DEEM'D SINCE I HAVE REACH'D TO POWER MY INNATE NATURE BE IT SO BUT FATHER THERE LIV'D ONE WHO THEN
HE WAS TO BLAME IN WEARING AWAY HIS YOUTH IN CONTEMPLATION WITH THE END OF POETIZING IN HIS MANHOOD WITH THE INCREASE OF HIS JUDGMENT THE LIGHT WHICH SHOULD MAKE IT APPARENT HAS FADED AWAY HIS JUDGMENT CONSEQUENTLY IS TOO CORRECT THIS MAY NOT BE UNDERSTOOD
SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED UPON AS A MERIT APPERTAINING TO THE AUTHORS OF THE POEMS ALMOST EVERY DEVOUT ADMIRER OF THE OLD BARDS IF DEMANDED HIS OPINION OF THEIR PRODUCTIONS WOULD MENTION VAGUELY YET WITH PERFECT SINCERITY
LET LIFE THEN AS THE DAY FLOWER FALL WITH THE NOON DAY BEAUTY WHICH IS ALL I REACH'D MY HOME MY HOME NO MORE FOR ALL HAD FLOWN WHO MADE IT SO
AND RAYS OF TRUTH YOU CANNOT SEE ARE FLASHING THRO ETERNITY I DO BELIEVE THAT EBLIS HATH A SNARE IN EV'RY HUMAN PATH ELSE HOW WHEN IN THE HOLY GROVE I WANDERED OF THE IDOL LOVE
BUT THEN IT WAS ONLY THE MAN OF GENIUS WHO COULD DULY ESTIMATE THE MERITS OF THE SANCTUM A SIGN CONSISTING OF A VAST FOLIO SWUNG BEFORE THE ENTRANCE
BUT WORSE STILL THAT HE MAY BEAR DOWN EVERY ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF THESE POEMS HE TRIUMPHANTLY DRAGS FORWARD A PASSAGE IN HIS ABOMINATION WITH WHICH HE EXPECTS THE READER TO SYMPATHIZE
WELL HAD IT BEEN IF THE SAME QUICK SENSE OF PROPRIETY HAD ATTENDED HIM IN THE PEDDLING PROPENSITY TO WHICH I HAVE FORMERLY ALLUDED BUT THIS WAS BY NO MEANS THE CASE
HAD THIS PECULIARITY NOT ATTRACTED OBSERVATION
AND THAT AGAIN A THIRD OF EVEN THE PROPER POETIC SENTIMENT INSPIRED BY THEIR WRITINGS SHOULD BE ASCRIBED TO A FACT WHICH WHILE IT HAS STRICT CONNECTION WITH POETRY IN THE ABSTRACT AND WITH THE OLD BRITISH POEMS THEMSELVES
WITH THE TWO FORMER ETHICS WERE THE END WITH THE TWO LATTER THE MEANS THE POET OF THE CREATION WISHED BY HIGHLY ARTIFICIAL VERSE
APPEARED TO MY HALF CLOSING EYE THE PAGEANTRY OF MONARCHY AND THE DEEP TRUMPET THUNDER'S ROAR CAME HURRIEDLY UPON ME TELLING OF HUMAN BATTLE WHERE MY VOICE MY OWN VOICE SILLY CHILD WAS SWELLING
SHE PATS THE PONY WHERE OR WHEN SHE KNOWS NOT HAPPY BETTY FOY OH JOHNNY NEVER MIND THE DOCTOR SECONDLY THE DEW WAS FALLING FAST THE STARS BEGAN TO BLINK I HEARD A VOICE IT SAID DRINK
HINTS WERE THROWN OUT OF AN EXCITING NATURE STORIES WERE TOLD OF PERILOUS BARGAINS MADE IN A HURRY AND REPENTED OF AT LEISURE
THAN THE REIGNING COSTUME PERMITTED THAT THE CUFFS WERE TURNED UP NOT AS USUAL IN THAT BARBAROUS PERIOD WITH CLOTH OF THE SAME QUALITY AND COLOR AS THE GARMENT BUT FACED IN A MORE FANCIFUL MANNER WITH THE PARTICOLORED VELVET OF GENOA
WHICH PUT A DEFINITE END TO INFIDELITY AMONG THE RATTLEBURGHERS AND CONVERTED TO THE ORTHODOXY OF THE GRANDAMES
WHO WENT TO SEEK HER PET WITH AN ARCH AND ROSY SMILE ON HER FACE CONSIDER THE GREAT VARIETY OF TRUTHFUL AND DELICATE THOUGHT IN THE FEW LINES WE HAVE QUOTED THE WONDER OF THE LITTLE MAIDEN AT THE FLEETNESS OF HER FAVORITE
IT SHOULD NOT BE DOUBTED THAT AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THE AFFECTION WITH WHICH WE REGARD THE ELDER POETS OF GREAT BRITAIN SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO WHAT IS IN ITSELF A THING APART FROM POETRY WE MEAN TO THE SIMPLE LOVE OF THE ANTIQUE
THUS WAS DELICATELY SHADOWED FORTH THE TWO FOLD OCCUPATION OF THE PROPRIETOR UPON STEPPING OVER THE THRESHOLD THE WHOLE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING PRESENTED ITSELF TO VIEW
AND THO MY TREAD WAS SOFT AND LOW A VOICE CAME FROM THE THRESHOLD STONE OF ONE WHOM I HAD EARLIER KNOWN O I DEFY THEE HELL TO SHOW ON BEDS OF FIRE THAT BURN BELOW A HUMBLER HEART
THE GAMBLERS OF WHOM I DESCRIED NOT A FEW WERE STILL MORE EASILY RECOGNISABLE THEY WORE EVERY VARIETY OF DRESS FROM THAT OF THE DESPERATE THIMBLE RIG BULLY
NO TINIEST FLY THE LIGHT'NING OF HIS EAGLE EYE HOW WAS IT THAT AMBITION CREPT UNSEEN AMID THE REVELS THERE TILL GROWING BOLD HE LAUGHED AND LEAPT IN THE TANGLES OF LOVE'S VERY HAIR
WHEN IMPEDED IN THEIR PROGRESS THESE PEOPLE SUDDENLY CEASED MUTTERING BUT RE DOUBLED THEIR GESTICULATIONS AND AWAITED WITH AN ABSENT AND OVERDONE SMILE UPON THE LIPS THE COURSE OF THE PERSONS IMPEDING THEM
IT WAS HERE ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK ONE NIGHT DURING THE SEVERE WINTER THE COMMENTS OF HIS NEIGHBOURS UPON HIS SINGULAR PROPENSITY THAT PIERRE BON BON I SAY HAVING TURNED THEM ALL OUT OF HIS HOUSE LOCKED THE DOOR
THEY WERE UNDOUBTEDLY NOBLEMEN MERCHANTS ATTORNEYS TRADESMEN STOCK JOBBERS THE EUPATRIDS AND THE COMMON PLACES OF SOCIETY MEN OF LEISURE AND MEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN AFFAIRS OF THEIR OWN CONDUCTING BUSINESS UPON THEIR OWN RESPONSIBILITY
THEY DID NOT GREATLY EXCITE MY ATTENTION THE TRIBE OF CLERKS WAS AN OBVIOUS ONE AND HERE I DISCERNED TWO REMARKABLE DIVISIONS THERE WERE THE JUNIOR CLERKS OF FLASH HOUSES YOUNG GENTLEMEN WITH TIGHT COATS BRIGHT BOOTS WELL OILED HAIR AND SUPERCILIOUS LIPS
WHEN PUSHED AGAINST BY FELLOW WAYFARERS THEY EVINCED NO SYMPTOM OF IMPATIENCE BUT ADJUSTED THEIR CLOTHES AND HURRIED ON
THAN OF JUST WHERE ONE'S OWN WRITINGS ARE THE TEST SIMPLY BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE BAD POETS THAN GOOD THERE ARE OF COURSE MANY OBJECTIONS TO WHAT I SAY MILTON IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE CONTRARY BUT HIS OPINION WITH RESPECT TO THE PARADISE REGAINED
AND I BELIEVE THE WINGED STRIFE AND TUMULT OF THE HEADLONG AIR HAVE NESTLED IN MY VERY HAIR SO LATE FROM HEAVEN THAT DEW IT FELL MID DREAMS OF AN UNHOLY NIGHT UPON ME WITH THE TOUCH OF HELL
AND THIN I WINKED AT HER HARD WID BOTH EYES AS MUCH AS TO SAY
AND THE MORE BY TOKEN THAT THE FRINCHMAN KIPT AN WID HIS WINKING AT THE WIDDY AND THE WIDDY SHE KEPT AN WID THE SQUAZING OF MY FLIPPER AS MUCH AS TO SAY AT HIM AGAIN SIR PATHRICK O'GRANDISON MAVOURNEEN
HOW TRUTHFUL AN AIR OF LAMENTATIONS HANGS HERE UPON EVERY SYLLABLE IT PERVADES ALL IT COMES OVER THE SWEET MELODY OF THE WORDS OVER THE GENTLENESS AND GRACE WHICH WE FANCY IN THE LITTLE MAIDEN HERSELF
THIS MY CHAMBER OF NEGLECT WALLED ABOUT WITH DISRESPECT FROM ALL THESE AND THIS DULL AIR A FIT OBJECT FOR DESPAIR SHE HATH TAUGHT ME BY HER MIGHT TO DRAW COMFORT
I WOULD BE AS MUCH ASHAMED OF THE WORLD'S GOOD OPINION AS PROUD OF YOUR OWN ANOTHER THAN YOURSELF MIGHT HERE OBSERVE SHAKESPEARE IS IN POSSESSION OF THE WORLD'S GOOD OPINION AND YET SHAKESPEARE IS THE GREATEST OF POETS IT APPEARS THEN THAT THE WORLD JUDGE CORRECTLY
WITH THE LOCALITIES OF WHICH THE STRANGER APPEARED WELL ACQUAINTED AND WHERE HIS ORIGINAL DEMEANOR AGAIN BECAME APPARENT AS HE FORCED HIS WAY TO AND FRO WITHOUT AIM AMONG THE HOST OF BUYERS AND SELLERS
IT WAS NOW NEARLY DAY BREAK BUT A NUMBER OF WRETCHED INEBRIATES STILL PRESSED IN AND OUT OF THE FLAUNTING ENTRANCE WITH A HALF SHRIEK OF JOY THE OLD MAN FORCED A PASSAGE WITHIN RESUMED AT ONCE HIS ORIGINAL BEARING AND STALKED BACKWARD AND FORWARD
THERE WAS THE SWATE LITTLE ANGEL MISTHRESS TRACLE THE TIP O THE MORNIN TO YE SAYS I MISSUS TRACLE
FOR MY OWN PART I DID NOT MUCH REGARD THE RAIN THE LURKING OF AN OLD FEVER IN MY SYSTEM RENDERING THE MOISTURE SOMEWHAT TOO DANGEROUSLY PLEASANT
AND THE BEE SOPHOCLES HAS TRANSMITTED TO ETERNITY A SORE TOE
WITH MY BROW TO THE GLASS I WAS THUS OCCUPIED IN SCRUTINIZING THE MOB WHEN SUDDENLY THERE CAME INTO VIEW A COUNTENANCE THAT OF A DECREPID OLD MAN SOME SIXTY FIVE OR SEVENTY YEARS OF AGE
NOR STRICTLY SPEAKING AN ARISTOTELIAN NOR DID HE
TWO DENSE AND CONTINUOUS TIDES OF POPULATION WERE RUSHING PAST THE DOOR AT THIS PARTICULAR PERIOD OF THE EVENING I HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN IN A SIMILAR SITUATION AND THE TUMULTUOUS SEA OF HUMAN HEADS FILLED ME THEREFORE WITH A DELICIOUS NOVELTY OF EMOTION
WHICH HATH STRIVEN TRIUMPHANTLY WITH HUMAN KIND ON MOUNTAIN SOIL I FIRST DREW LIFE
OCCURRED IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN MISTER BARNABAS SHUTTLEWORTHY ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST AND MOST RESPECTABLE CITIZENS OF THE BOROUGH HAD BEEN MISSING FOR SEVERAL DAYS UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH GAVE RISE TO SUSPICION OF FOUL PLAY
CETERIS PARIBUS MORE ARTIFICIAL WE CAN NOT BRING OURSELVES TO BELIEVE THAT THE SELECTIONS OF THE BOOK OF GEMS ARE SUCH AS WILL IMPART TO A POETICAL READER
AND THEN HE MADE ME A BROTH OF A BOW AND THIN HE SAID HE HAD OUNLY TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF DOING ME THE HONOR OF THE GIVING ME A CALL AND THIN
AND I WISH I MAY BE DROWNTHED DEAD IN A BOG IF IT'S NOT MESILF SIR PATHRICK O'GRANDISON BARRONITT
AND IMPORTANCE FAR FROM IT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IN WHICH BRANCH OF HIS PROFESSION HE TOOK THE GREATER PRIDE IN HIS OPINION
BY FAR THE GREATER NUMBER OF THOSE WHO WENT BY HAD A SATISFIED BUSINESS LIKE DEMEANOR AND SEEMED TO BE THINKING ONLY OF MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE PRESS THEIR BROWS WERE KNIT AND THEIR EYES ROLLED QUICKLY
AND MANY HIGH COMPLIMENTS TO OLD CHARLEY UPON HIS SAGACITY AND CONSIDERATION AS MANY OF THE BURGHERS HAD BROUGHT SPADES WITH THEM SUPPOSING THAT THEY MIGHT POSSIBLY BE CALLED UPON TO DISINTER A CORPSE THE DRAIN WAS EASILY AND SPEEDILY EFFECTED AND NO SOONER WAS THE BOTTOM VISIBLE
AND WITHOUT HIS MASTER'S SADDLE BAGS AND ALL BLOODY FROM A PISTOL SHOT
THEN IN MY BOYHOOD WHEN THEIR FIRE BURN'D WITH A STILL INTENSER GLOW FOR PASSION MUST WITH YOUTH EXPIRE E'EN THEN WHO KNEW THIS IRON HEART IN WOMAN'S WEAKNESS HAD A PART
THE GODDESS IN A WELL WITNESS THE LIGHT WHICH BACON HAS THROWN UPON PHILOSOPHY WITNESS THE PRINCIPLES OF OUR DIVINE FAITH THAT MORAL MECHANISM BY WHICH THE SIMPLICITY OF A CHILD MAY OVERBALANCE THE WISDOM OF A MAN WE SEE AN INSTANCE OF COLERIDGE'S LIABILITY TO ERR IN HIS
UPON THEM WITH AN OATH AND BETOOK HIMSELF IN NO VERY PACIFIC MOOD TO THE COMFORTS OF A LEATHER BOTTOMED ARM CHAIR AND A FIRE OF BLAZING FAGOTS
OLD CHARLEYS FAVORITE BEVERAGE WAS CHATEAU MARGAUX AND IT APPEARED TO DO MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY'S HEART GOOD TO SEE THE OLD FELLOW SWALLOW IT AS HE DID QUART AFTER QUART SO THAT ONE DAY WHEN THE WINE WAS IN AND THE WIT AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE SOMEWHAT OUT
WHAT THO THE MOON THE WHITE MOON SHED ALL THE SPLENDOUR OF HER NOON HER SMILE IS CHILLY AND HER BEAM IN THAT TIME OF DREARINESS WILL SEEM SO LIKE YOU GATHER IN YOUR BREATH A PORTRAIT TAKEN AFTER DEATH
ALTHOUGH THIS LATTER OCCURRENCE WAS INDEED BY NO MEANS A NOVELTY FOR NO GOOD WILL HAD SUBSISTED BETWEEN THE PARTIES FOR THE LAST THREE OR FOUR MONTHS
AND THAT HIS TOUT ENSEMBLE GAVE RISE TO THE REMARKABLE WORDS OF BENEVENUTA THE IMPROVISATRICE OF FLORENCE
THIS NEPHEW WHOSE NAME WAS PENNIFEATHER WOULD LISTEN TO NOTHING LIKE REASON IN THE MATTER OF LYING QUIET BUT INSISTED UPON MAKING IMMEDIATE SEARCH FOR THE CORPSE OF THE MURDERED MAN THIS WAS THE EXPRESSION HE EMPLOYED
AS LIVED OVER THE WAY AND JIST WID THAT
AS TO WORDSWORTH I HAVE NO FAITH IN HIM THAT HE HAD IN YOUTH THE FEELINGS OF A POET I BELIEVE FOR THERE ARE GLIMPSES OF EXTREME DELICACY IN HIS WRITINGS AND DELICACY IS THE POET'S OWN KINGDOM HIS EL DORADO
THE FOREMOST AND MOST ENERGETIC IN INSTITUTING THIS SEARCH WAS THE BOSOM FRIEND OF MISTER SHUTTLEWORTHY A MISTER CHARLES GOODFELLOW OR AS HE WAS UNIVERSALLY CALLED CHARLEY GOODFELLOW OR OLD CHARLEY GOODFELLOW
AND THEN HE LET DOWN THE TWO CORNERS OF HIS PURRATY TRAP AND THIN NOT A HAPORTH MORE OF THE SATISFACTION COULD I GIT OUT O THE SPALPEEN
FOR OLD CHARLEY NEVER LET A DAY PASS WITHOUT STEPPING IN THREE OR FOUR TIMES TO SEE HOW HIS NEIGHBOUR CAME ON AND VERY OFTEN HE WOULD STAY TO BREAKFAST OR TEA AND ALMOST ALWAYS TO DINNER AND THEN THE AMOUNT OF WINE THAT WAS MADE WAY WITH BY THE TWO CRONIES AT A SITTING
NOT ALTOGETHER UNWORTHY OF A DOG IT IS HOWEVER TRUE THAT MUCH OF THIS HABITUAL RESPECT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE PERSONAL APPEARANCE OF THE METAPHYSICIAN A DISTINGUISHED EXTERIOR WILL
IT WAS CONSIDERED ALMOST A MATTER OF COURSE THAT THE SEEKERS SHOULD DISPERSE THAT IS TO SAY DISTRIBUTE THEMSELVES IN PARTIES FOR THE MORE THOROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE REGION ROUND ABOUT I FORGET HOWEVER BY WHAT INGENIOUS TRAIN OF REASONING IT WAS THAT
HIS HEAD AGAIN FELL UPON HIS BREAST HE APPEARED AS I HAD SEEN HIM AT FIRST I OBSERVED THAT HE NOW TOOK THE COURSE IN WHICH HAD GONE THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE AUDIENCE BUT UPON THE WHOLE I WAS AT A LOSS TO COMPREHEND THE WAYWARDNESS OF HIS ACTIONS
AND AT LENGTH LARGE BANDS OF THE MOST ABANDONED OF A LONDON POPULACE WERE SEEN REELING TO AND FRO THE SPIRITS OF THE OLD MAN AGAIN FLICKERED UP AS A LAMP WHICH IS NEAR ITS DEATH HOUR ONCE MORE HE STRODE ONWARD WITH ELASTIC TREAD
HE CROSSED AND RE CROSSED THE WAY REPEATEDLY WITHOUT APPARENT AIM AND THE PRESS WAS STILL SO THICK THAT AT EVERY SUCH MOVEMENT I WAS OBLIGED TO FOLLOW HIM CLOSELY THE STREET WAS A NARROW AND LONG ONE AND HIS COURSE LAY WITHIN IT FOR NEARLY AN HOUR
OF THAT DAY WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN TWICE AS MUCH FOR AN
FOR SOME ALLEGED EXCESS OF LIBERTY THAT THE LATTER HAD TAKEN IN THE UNCLE'S HOUSE OF WHICH THE NEPHEW WAS AN INMATE UPON THIS OCCASION OLD CHARLEY IS SAID TO HAVE BEHAVED WITH EXEMPLARY MODERATION AND CHRISTIAN CHARITY HE AROSE FROM THE BLOW ADJUSTED HIS CLOTHES AND
I GAVE UP AT LENGTH ALL CARE OF THINGS WITHIN THE HOTEL AND BECAME ABSORBED IN CONTEMPLATION OF THE SCENE WITHOUT AT FIRST MY OBSERVATIONS TOOK AN ABSTRACT AND GENERALIZING TURN
I WAS AS MAD AS A GRASSHOPPER
THE HERESY OF WHAT IS CALLED VERY FOOLISHLY THE LAKE SCHOOL SOME YEARS AGO I MIGHT HAVE BEEN INDUCED BY AN OCCASION LIKE THE PRESENT TO ATTEMPT A FORMAL REFUTATION OF THEIR DOCTRINE AT PRESENT IT WOULD BE A WORK OF SUPEREROGATION
NAKEDLY OR BUT AWKWARDLY CONCEALED NO PREPOSSESSION FOR THE MERE ANTIQUE AND IN THIS CASE WE CAN IMAGINE NO OTHER PREPOSSESSION SHOULD INDUCE US TO DIGNIFY WITH THE SACRED NAME OF POETRY
THE WORLD AND ALL IT DID CONTAIN IN THE EARTH THE AIR THE SEA ITS JOY ITS LITTLE LOT OF PAIN THAT WAS NEW PLEASURE THE IDEAL DIM VANITIES OF DREAMS BY NIGHT AND DIMMER NOTHINGS WHICH WERE REAL
THERE'S A BITTHER CHANCE FOR YE MAVOURNEEN FOR IT'S NOT ALTOGETHER THE GENTAAL THING TO BE AFTHER THE SQUAZING OF MY FLIPPER RIGHT FULL IN THE SIGHT OF THAT LITTLE FURRENNER FRINCHMAN
THE POWERS OF THE INTELLECT HELD INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH THE CAPABILITIES OF THE STOMACH I AM NOT SURE INDEED THAT HE GREATLY DISAGREED WITH THE CHINESE WHO HELD
THAT LEARNING HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH THE IMAGINATION INTELLECT WITH THE PASSIONS OR AGE WITH POETRY TRIFLES LIKE STRAWS UPON THE SURFACE FLOW HE WHO WOULD SEARCH FOR PEARLS MUST DIVE BELOW
OF LILIES COLD AND THESE THINGS BEING ITS CHIEF DELIGHTS AND THEN THE PRE EMINENT BEAUTY AND NATURALNESS OF THE CONCLUDING LINES WHOSE VERY HYPERBOLE ONLY RENDERS THEM MORE TRUE TO NATURE
BIOGRAPHIA LITERARIA' PROFESSEDLY HIS LITERARY LIFE AND OPINIONS BUT IN FACT A TREATISE DE OMNI SCIBILI ET QUIBUSDAM ALIIS HE GOES WRONG BY REASON OF HIS VERY PROFUNDITY AND OF HIS ERROR WE HAVE A NATURAL TYPE IN THE CONTEMPLATION OF A STAR
IN THE TWINKLING O THE EYE OF A LONDONDERRY PURRATY AND IT WAS THE NIXT MORNIN SURE JIST
THE DIVISION OF THE UPPER CLERKS OF STAUNCH FIRMS OR OF THE STEADY OLD FELLOWS IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO MISTAKE
AND IN ONE CORNER THERE WAS A FORTY PINNY AND A JEW'S HARP AND THE DIVIL KNOWS WHAT ILSE AND IN ANOTHER CORNER WAS A SOFY THE BEAUTIFULLEST THING IN ALL NATUR AND SITTING ON THE SOFY SURE ENOUGH
AND THUS ALL THE HEARTY CARELESS WALKING GENTLEMEN OF THE STAGE ARE VERY CERTAIN TO BE CALLED CHARLES NOW OLD CHARLEY GOODFELLOW ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN IN RATTLEBOROUGH NOT LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS OR THEREABOUTS
THEY MAY BE DEFINED AS THE GENTLEMEN WHO LIVE BY THEIR WITS THEY SEEM TO PREY UPON THE PUBLIC IN TWO BATTALIONS THAT OF THE DANDIES AND THAT OF THE MILITARY MEN OF THE FIRST GRADE THE LEADING FEATURES ARE LONG LOCKS AND SMILES
THAT LIVES JIST OVER THE WAY AND THAT'S A OGGLING AND A GOGGLING THE HOUL DAY AND BAD LUCK TO HIM AT THE PURTY WIDDY MISTHRESS TRACLE THAT'S MY OWN NIXT DOOR NEIGHBOR GOD BLISS HER
OR HER GRIEF OR THE FRAGRANCE AND WARMTH AND APPROPRIATENESS OF THE LITTLE NEST LIKE BED OF LILIES AND ROSES WHICH THE FAWN DEVOURED AS IT LAY UPON THEM AND COULD SCARCELY BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THEM BY THE ONCE HAPPY LITTLE DAMSEL
A SNOW WHITE MOUNTAIN LAMB WITH A MAIDEN AT ITS SIDE NO OTHER SHEEP WAS NEAR THE LAMB WAS ALL ALONE AND BY A SLENDER CORD WAS TETHER'D TO A STONE NOW WE HAVE NO DOUBT THIS IS ALL TRUE WE WILL BELIEVE IT INDEED WE WILL MISTER W
MANY'S THE TIME I'VE WATCHED THE POLICEMAN OFF HIS BEAT AND PEEPED THROUGH THE CHINK OF THE WINDOW SHUTTER TO SEE THE OLD ROOM
OH I DON'T KNOW SHE SEEMS SO MUCH BETTER THAN I AM AND HER VOICE WHEN I HEAR IT AND THINK OF THE WISHES THAT ARE IN MY HEART IT SEEMS AS MUCH OUT OF PLACE TO ASK HER TO BE MY WIFE
ALMOST AMOUNTING TO INSANITY AND SHAKING JEM'S ARM IN ORDER TO FORCE AN ANSWER FROM HIM
ANONYMOUS THE EVENTS RECORDED IN THE LAST CHAPTER TOOK PLACE ON A TUESDAY ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON MARY WAS SURPRISED IN THE MIDST OF SOME LITTLE BUSTLE IN WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED
TO WHOM COULD SHE SPEAK AND ASK FOR AID SHE SHRANK FROM THE IDEA OF ADDRESSING JOHN BARTON AGAIN HER HEART SANK WITHIN HER AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF HIS FIERCE REPULSING ACTION AND FAR FIERCER WORDS
LET ME STAY UP A LITTLE PLEADED MARY AS HER HOSTESS SEEMED SO RESOLUTE ABOUT SEEING HER TO BED HER LOOKS WON HER SUIT WELL I SUPPOSE I MUN I SHALL CATCH IT DOWN STAIRS I KNOW
DON'T GO YET FATHER I CAN'T BEAR YOU TO GO YET COME IN AND EAT SOME SUPPER YOU LOOK SO GHASTLY DEAR FATHER DO NO HE SAID FAINTLY AND MOURNFULLY IT'S BEST AS IT IS
I'VE TASTED TEA IN CHINA SINCE THEN BUT IT WASN'T HALF SO GOOD AS THE HERB TEA SHE USED TO MAKE FOR ME O SUNDAY NIGHTS AND SHE KNEW SUCH A DEAL ABOUT PLANTS AND BIRDS AND THEIR WAYS SHE USED TO TELL ME LONG STORIES ABOUT HER CHILDHOOD
AND WILL WITHDREW TO HIS NEIGHBOURING LODGING AND JANE AND ALICE WILSON HAD RAKED THE FIRE AND FASTENED DOORS AND SHUTTERS AND PATTERED UP STAIRS WITH THEIR TOTTERING FOOT STEPS AND SHRILL VOICES JEM TOO WENT TO THE CLOSET TERMED HIS BED ROOM
THE MINUTE I TOLD MY ERRAND SHE WERE READY AND WILLING TO GO TO JANE WILSON AND STOP UP ALL NIGHT WITH ALICE AND WHAT DOES THE DOCTOR SAY ASKED MARY OH MUCH WHAT ALL DOCTORS SAY
AND IT WAS WINTER COLD BLEAK WINTER
THE GIRL'S CHEEK FLUSHED AND THEN BLANCHED TO A DEAD WHITENESS A FILM CAME OVER HER EYES AND CATCHING AT THE DRESSER FOR SUPPORT IN THAT HOT WHIRLING ROOM SHE FELL IN A HEAP ON THE FLOOR
THREATENED TO TURN US OUT UNLESS HIS RENT WAS PAID
WITH MONOMANIACAL INCESSANCY AND THAT THOUGHT WAS HOW TO SAVE MARY HER DEAD SISTER'S ONLY CHILD HER OWN LITTLE PET IN THE DAYS OF HER INNOCENCE FROM FOLLOWING IN THE SAME DOWNWARD PATH TO VICE
THAN IT WAS NOW TO BEAR HIS PRESENT HEAVY BURDEN BUT IT WAS TOO HEAVY TOO GRIEVOUS TO BE BORNE AND LIVE HE WOULD SLAY HIMSELF AND THE LOVERS SHOULD LOVE ON
HE ONLY REMEMBERED IT TO BE THANKFUL HE HAD NOT YIELDED TO THE TEMPTATION OF TRYING HIS FATE AGAIN NOT IN ACTUAL WORDS BUT IN A MEETING WHERE HER MANNER SHOULD TELL FAR MORE THAN WORDS THAT HER SWEETER SMILES HER DAINTY MOVEMENTS
AND THE SUN SHINE BRIGHT AND HE WITH HIS BURNING WOEFUL HEART WOULD BE AT REST
BETTER WE WERE ALL DEAD THIS WAS SAID AS IF THINKING ALOUD BUT HE IMMEDIATELY CHANGED HIS TONE AND CONTINUED ESTHER YOU MAY TRUST TO MY DOING ALL I CAN FOR MARY THAT I HAVE DETERMINED ON
BUT NOW IT SEEMED AS IF A SUDDEN SPRING OF SISTERLY LOVE HAD GUSHED UP IN HER HEART SO SORRY DID SHE FEEL TO HEAR OF HIS APPROACHING DEPARTURE IT'S VERY SUDDEN ISN'T IT
WHEN DO YOU GO TO NIGHT I SHAN'T SEE YOU AGAIN TO NIGHT AND YOU GO TO LIVERPOOL MAY BE YOU AND FATHER WILL GO TOGETHER HE'S GOING TO GLASGOW BY WAY OF LIVERPOOL
YOU'LL THINK ON ME ON TUESDAY MARY THAT'S THE DAY WE SHALL HOIST OUR BLUE PETER JACK HARRIS SAYS MARY WAS HEARTILY SORRY WHEN THE DOOR CLOSED IT SEEMED LIKE SHUTTING OUT A FRIENDLY SUNBEAM AND HER FATHER
SHE SAT ON THE LITTLE WINDOW SEAT HER HAND HOLDING BACK THE CURTAIN WHICH SHADED THE ROOM FROM THE BRIGHT MOONLIGHT WITHOUT HER HEAD RESTING ITS WEARINESS AGAINST THE CORNER OF THE WINDOW FRAME HER EYES BURNING AND STIFF WITH THE INTENSITY OF HER GAZE
NAY NAY WHO E'ER THOU BE'ST THOU'RT NOT FIT TO GO OUT INTO THE STREET PERHAPS SINKING HER VOICE A LITTLE THOU'RT A BAD ONE I ALMOST MISDOUBT THEE THOU'RT SO PRETTY
HISSING OUT HER WORDS WITH FRIGHT
SOME ONE SHOULD DIE HE WOULD RATHER MARY WERE DEAD COLD IN HER GRAVE THAN THAT SHE WERE ANOTHER'S A VISION OF HER PALE SWEET FACE WITH HER BRIGHT HAIR ALL BEDABBLED WITH GORE SEEMED TO FLOAT CONSTANTLY BEFORE HIS ACHING EYES
BEFORE ALL THE OTHER PART OF THE STREET AND HAD A COUNTRY TOWN LOOK ABOUT IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT BUSTLING BACK STREET HE PULLED HER INTO THE HOUSE PLACE AND RELIEVED TO A CERTAIN DEGREE OF HIS FEAR OF LOSING HER ON THE WAY HE EXCLAIMED THERE
I WROTE OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO HER FATHER FOR HELP BUT HE MUST HAVE CHANGED HIS QUARTERS
SHE BROKE THE SILENCE OH JEM I CHARGE YOU WITH THE CARE OF HER I SUPPOSE IT WOULD BE MURDER TO KILL HER BUT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HER TO DIE THAN TO LIVE TO LEAD SUCH A LIFE AS I DO
I MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER WITH THE MONEY I SEE NOW
OFTEN WHEN SHE LITTLE KNEW ANY ONE WAS NEAR HER THERE WAS ONE OF HER COMPANIONS I NEVER COULD ABIDE
ALICE HER DULLED SENSES DEADENING DAY BY DAY SAT MUTELY NEAR THE FIRE
SHE DISLIKED SPEAKING HER POWER OVER HER WORDS SEEMED SO UTTERLY GONE SHE USED QUITE DIFFERENT EXPRESSIONS TO THOSE SHE INTENDED SO SHE KEPT SILENT WHILE MISSUS STURGIS FOR THAT WAS THE NAME OF HER HOSTESS TALKED AWAY AND PUT HER TEA THINGS BY
KNOWING THAT HIS VOICE REPEATED WHAT WAS PASSING TO HER DEAFENED EAR THAT HIS ARM REMOVED EACH LITTLE OBSTACLE TO HER TOTTERING STEPS AND WILL OUT OF THE VERY KINDNESS OF HIS HEART TALKED MORE AND MORE MERRILY THAN EVER
IN FALLING WRENCHED THEM WITH SUCH CRUEL FORCE THAT THOUGH WE COVERED THEM AGAIN WITH CARE ITS BEAUTY WITHERED AND IT PINED AWAY SO COULD WE LOOK INTO THE HUMAN BREAST HOW OFT THE FATAL BLIGHT THAT MEETS OUR VIEW
AY I'M ONE SURE ENOUGH
AND THAT IS THAT I'D NEVER GRIEVED HER OH MARY MANY A HASTY WORD COMES SORELY BACK ON THE HEART WHEN ONE THINKS ONE SHALL NEVER SEE THE PERSON WHOM ONE HAS GRIEVED AGAIN THEY BOTH STOOD THINKING
BLESS US AND SAVE US HE'S BURNING IT
TO FANCY WHERE AND HOW THE WINGS WOULD BE FASTENED TO THE BROWN STUFF GOWN OR THE BLUE AND YELLOW PRINT WILL LAUGHED TOO A LITTLE OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH MARY'S PRETTY MERRY LAUGH THEN HE SAID
AND THAT I'M SURE SHE WOULDN'T DO WHEN SHE KNEW WHERE TO FIND ME WILL SHE COME BACK BY HERSEL ASKED MARY AY AT FIRST I WERE AFRAID O TRUSTING HER AND I USED TO FOLLOW HER A BIT BEHIND NEVER LETTING ON OF COURSE BUT
AND NOW SHE DREADED LEST HE SHOULD LEARN SHE WAS ALONE HER HEART BEGAN TO DESPAIR TOO ABOUT JEM SHE FEARED HE HAD CEASED TO LOVE HER AND SHE SHE ONLY LOVED HIM MORE AND MORE FOR HIS SEEMING NEGLECT
DEAR AND HOW DIFFERENT IT IS HERE IS SHE STILL IN A BACK STREET O MANCHESTER NEVER LIKELY TO SEE HER OWN HOME AGAIN AND I A SAILOR OFF FOR AMERICA NEXT WEEK
WENT ON TO ASSURE MARY THE BED WAS WELL AIRED I CANNOT SLEEP THANK YOU I WILL SIT HERE IF YOU PLEASE SAID MARY SINKING DOWN ON THE WINDOW SEAT COME NOW SAID MISSUS STURGIS MY MASTER TOLD ME TO SEE YOU TO BED AND I MUN
AS YOU BROUGHT HER HOME POOR THING WE MUST NOT ASK AUGHT ABOUT HER BUT THAT SHE NEEDS HELP I WISH I'D MY SALTS AT HOME BUT I LENT EM TO MISSUS BURTON LAST SUNDAY IN CHURCH FOR SHE COULD NOT KEEP AWAKE THROUGH THE SERMON DEAR A ME HOW WHITE SHE IS
AGAINST THE WALL WERE WAFERED TWO ROUGH DRAWINGS OF VESSELS WITH THEIR NAMES WRITTEN UNDERNEATH ON WHICH THE MOTHER'S EYES CAUGHT AND GAZED UNTIL THEY FILLED WITH TEARS BUT SHE BRUSHED THE DROPS AWAY WITH THE BACK OF HER HAND
AND AFTER MANY AN HOUR OF WEARY WORK THEY'RE READY TO FOLLOW AFTER ANY NOVELTY THAT MAKES A LITTLE CHANGE BUT I MADE UP MY MIND THAT BAD AS I WAS I COULD WATCH OVER MARY AND PERHAPS KEEP HER FROM HARM
HE WENT UP TO JOB AND MORE CIVILLY THAN MARY EXPECTED WISHED HIM GOOD BYE HE THEN TURNED TO HER AND IN A SHORT COLD MANNER BADE HER FAREWELL OH FATHER DON'T GO YET
SHE SAID AGAIN AUTHORITATIVELY FOR MARY BARTON'S SAKE THE SPELL OF HER NAME WAS AS POTENT AS THAT OF THE MARINER'S GLITTERING EYE HE LISTENED LIKE A THREE YEAR CHILD
AND IT'S ALL GONE BUT THIS JINGLING A FEW COPPERS IN HIS HAND NAY NEVER FRET OVER MY WALKING A MATTER OF THIRTY MILE ADDED HE AS HE SAW SHE LOOKED GRAVE AND SORRY IT'S A FINE CLEAR NIGHT AND I SHALL SET OFF BETIMES
FELL LIKE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS FOR HE HAD BEEN THE HUSBAND OF HER YOUTH AND EVEN HE ROUGH AND CRABBED AS HE WAS WAS SECRETLY SOOTHED BY THE SOUND OF HER VOICE ALTHOUGH NOT FOR WORLDS IF HE COULD HAVE HELPED IT
BUT ALAS ALAS MY LITTLE GIRL FELL ILL AND I COULD NOT MIND MY SHOP AND HER TOO AND THINGS GREW WORSE AND WORSE
SUDDENLY MARY STARTED THAT'S FATHER'S STEP AND HIS SHIRT'S NOT READY SHE HURRIED TO HER IRONS AND TRIED TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME JOHN BARTON CAME IN SUCH A HAGGARD AND WILDLY ANXIOUS LOOKING MAN
AND SO GOOD AS SHE HAS BEEN WHEN I LIVED WITH HER A LITTLE WEE CHAP I USED TO BE WAKENED BY THE NEIGHBOURS KNOCKING HER UP
IT'S MY FOURTH VOYAGE IN THE SAME SHIP AND WITH THE SAME CAPTAIN AND HE'S PROMISED HE'LL MAKE ME SECOND MATE AFTER THIS TRIP THEN I SHALL HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER MARGARET AND HER GRANDFATHER AND AUNT ALICE SHALL LIVE WITH HER
AND WHEN I CAME OUT ALL WAS GOING ON AS BEFORE
CHAPTER FOURTEEN JEM'S INTERVIEW WITH POOR ESTHER KNOW THE TEMPTATION ERE YOU JUDGE THE CRIME LOOK ON THIS TREE
SHE HAD OFFERED NO RESISTANCE TO THE OLD BOATMAN WHEN HE HAD CLUTCHED HER ARM IN ORDER TO INSURE HER FOLLOWING HIM AS HE THREADED THE CROWDED DOCK WAYS AND DIVED UP STRANGE BYE STREETS SHE CAME ON MEEKLY AFTER HIM
AND OUT OF THIS HE HAD GIVEN MARY A FEW SHILLINGS IN THE MORNING SO SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO BUY A SUFFICIENT MEAL AND NOW HER CARE WAS TO COOK IT
AND OH JEM HER FATHER WON'T LISTEN TO ME AND IT'S YOU MUST SAVE MARY YOU'RE LIKE A BROTHER TO HER AND MAYBE COULD GIVE HER ADVICE AND WATCH OVER HER AND AT ANY RATE JOHN WILL HEARKEN TO YOU ONLY HE'S SO STERN AND SO CRUEL
HE CAME IN AND SAT DOWN MORE QUIETLY THAN USUAL WHY WILL WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU YOU SEEM QUITE CUT UP ABOUT SOMETHING AND I AM MARY I'M COME TO SAY GOOD BYE
AND AS IF ALL THIS AGGREGATE OF SORROWFUL THOUGHTS WAS NOT ENOUGH
AS SUCH HE OUGHT TO ASCERTAIN HARRY CARSON'S INTENTIONS TOWARDS HER IN WINNING HER AFFECTIONS HE WOULD ASK HIM STRAIGHTFORWARDLY AS BECAME MAN SPEAKING TO MAN NOT CONCEALING IF NEED WERE
MUST BE SPENT WITHOUT MARY NAY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS SHE WAS ANOTHER'S THAT HELL OF THOUGHT HE WOULD RESERVE FOR THE QUIET OF HIS OWN ROOM THE DEAD STILLNESS OF NIGHT HE WAS ON THE THRESHOLD OF HOME NOW
BUT JEM KNEW HE HAD POWER OVER JOHN BARTON'S MIND AND IT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO EXERT THAT POWER IN PROMOTING MARY'S HAPPINESS AND TO RELINQUISH ALL THOUGHT OF SELF IN SO DOING
I LONGED TO BUY HER SOMETHING AND I THOUGHT IF IT WERE SOMETHING IN THE MUSIC LINE SHE WOULD MAY BE FANCY IT MORE SO WILL YOU GIVE IT TO HER MARY WHEN I'M GONE AND IF YOU CAN SLIP IN SOMETHING TENDER SOMETHING
HE INTERRUPTED HIS EARNEST GAZE INTO HER FACE WITH THE EXCLAMATION AND WHO CAN YO BE TO KNOW MARY BARTON OR TO KNOW THAT SHE'S OUGHT TO ME
BUT I TURN AWAY AND WORK AWAY AND TRY NEVER TO THINK ON THE WIND
THERE WAS A LITTLE STRIFE IN ESTHER'S MIND FOR AN INSTANT BETWEEN THE SHAME OF ACKNOWLEDGING HERSELF AND THE ADDITIONAL WEIGHT TO HER REVELATION WHICH SUCH ACKNOWLEDGMENT WOULD GIVE THEN SHE SPOKE DO YOU REMEMBER ESTHER
DON'T TELL ME ANY MORE ABOUT YOURSEL SAID JEM SOOTHINGLY WHAT YOU'RE TIRED ALREADY ARE YOU
BECAUSE MARY HAD NO OTHER FRIEND CAPABLE OF THE DUTY REQUIRED OF HIM THE DUTY OF A BROTHER AS ESTHER IMAGINED HIM TO BE IN FEELING FROM HIS LONG FRIENDSHIP HE WOULD BE UNTO HER AS A BROTHER
HER VOICE ROSE AGAIN TO THE SHARP PITCH OF AGONY MY DARLING MY DARLING
I AM PAST HOPE YOU CAN YET SAVE MARY YOU MUST SHE IS INNOCENT
TOO LATE SHE ADDED WITH ACCENTS OF DEEP DESPAIR STILL HE DID NOT RELAX HIS HOLD COME HOME HE SAID I TELL YOU I CANNOT
AFTERWARDS I WILL TELL IT YOU NAY DON'T CHANGE YOUR FICKLE MIND NOW AND SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT YOU MUST HEAR IT AND I MUST TELL IT AND THEN SEE AFTER MARY AND TAKE CARE SHE DOES NOT BECOME LIKE ME AS SHE IS LOVING NOW
JEM COULD ONLY IMAGINE IT A GREAT PRIVILEGE TO LAY IT AT THE FEET OF THE LOVED ONE HARRY CARSON'S MOTHER HAD BEEN A FACTORY GIRL SO AFTER ALL WHAT WAS THE GREAT REASON FOR DOUBTING HIS INTENTIONS TOWARDS MARY
AY I DARE SAY IT'S BEST ONE THING I DO WISH THOUGH AND I HAVE OFTEN WISHED IT WHEN OUT ALONE ON THE DEEP SEA
IT WAS POSSIBLE NAY TO JEM'S HEART VERY PROBABLE THAT HE MIGHT ONLY BE TOO HAPPY TO MARRY HER SHE WAS A LADY BY RIGHT OF NATURE JEM THOUGHT IN MOVEMENT GRACE AND SPIRIT
THE QUESTION WAS ASKED THOUGHTLESSLY BUT ANSWERED WITH FIERCE EARNESTNESS WHERE HAVE I BEEN WHAT HAVE I BEEN DOING WHY DO YOU TORMENT ME WITH QUESTIONS LIKE THESE CAN YOU NOT GUESS
WELL A WELL IT'S THE BAD ONES AS HAVE THE BROKEN HEARTS SURE ENOUGH GOOD FOLK NEVER GET UTTERLY CAST DOWN THEY'VE ALWAYS GETTEN HOPE IN THE LORD IT'S THE SINFUL AS BEAR THE BITTER BITTER GRIEF IN THEIR CRUSHED HEARTS POOR SOULS
YOU DON'T GUESS HOW KIND HE WAS HE GAVE ME FIFTY POUND BEFORE WE PARTED AND I KNEW HE COULD ILL SPARE IT DON'T JEM PLEASE AS HIS MUTTERED INDIGNATION ROSE AGAIN FOR HER SAKE HE CEASED
THE RUDDY MORNING STOLE UP THE HORIZON CASTING A CRIMSON GLOW INTO THE WATCHER'S ROOM
TOO BUSY TO MISS HIM BUT NOW RECEIVED HIM WITH THANKFULNESS AND WITH AN ELOQUENT IRISH BLESSING WHEN JOHN HEARD THE WORDS OF BLESSING HE SHOOK HIS HEAD MOURNFULLY AND TURNED AWAY TO RETRACE HIS STEPS LET US LEAVE HIM
THE AFTERNOON AND THE PARTING WITH WILL HAD WEAKENED HER NERVES FOR ANY AFTER SHOCK WHAT IS IT DO TELL US MARGARET SAID MARY PLACING HER IN A CHAIR AND LOOSENING HER BONNET STRINGS I THINK IT'S A STROKE O THE PALSY
IN THE TUMULT OF HIS OTHER FEELINGS HIS SELF REPROACH WAS DEADENED FOR THE TIME BUT MANY AND MANY A DAY AFTERWARDS HE BITTERLY REGRETTED HIS OMISSION OF DUTY HIS WEARINESS OF WELL DOING
EVIDENTLY FEARING THE STRENGTH OF HIS OWN RESOLUTION IF HARD PRESSED BY ENTREATY I'M NOT A GOING WILL I DARE SAY YOU'RE RIGHT ONLY I CAN'T HELP FEELING SORRY YOU'RE GOING AWAY IT SEEMS SO FLAT TO BE LEFT BEHIND
HER FATHER AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT SLACKENED HIS PACE AND FELL INTO THAT HEAVY LISTLESS STEP WHICH TOLD AS WELL AS WORDS COULD DO OF HOPELESSNESS AND WEAKNESS IT WAS GETTING DARK BUT HE LOITERED ON
HE WOULD TAKE PLEASURE IN HER DESOLATION OF HEART NO HE COULD NOT SAID THE STILL SMALL VOICE IT WOULD BE WORSE
MARY TOOK HER SEWING AFTER HE HAD GONE AND SAT ON AND SAT ON
MARY DID NOT ANSWER BUT TREMBLED ALL OVER STURGIS SAW IT DON'T BOTHER HER WITH THY QUESTIONS SAID HE TO HIS WIFE
IN HIS OWN HOUSE JOB HOWEVER DID NOT STAND UPON CEREMONY HE HAD COME TO PAY A VISIT AND WAS NOT TO BE DAUNTED FROM HIS PURPOSE HE WAS INTERESTED IN JOHN BARTON'S MISSION TO GLASGOW AND WANTED TO HEAR ALL ABOUT IT
TO THE CONCLUSION THAT MISTER CARSON'S INTENTIONS WERE EVIL TOWARDS MARY
AND HIMSELF FOR HIS WEAKNESS IN YIELDING TO HER OBSTINACY WHEN SHE INSISTED ON BEING THE ONE TO FOLLOW AND FIND OUT WILL SHE DID NOT PASS THAT NIGHT IN BED ANY MORE THAN JOB BUT SHE WAS UNDER A RESPECTABLE ROOF AND AMONG KIND THOUGH ROUGH PEOPLE
OR FAR HAPPIER STILL WITH DEEP BREATH BURIED IN FORGETFULNESS O ALL THE DISMALLEST IMAGES OF DEATH DID SWIM BEFORE MY EYES WILSON AND NOW WHERE WAS MARY
WITHOUT PROTEST HE ALLOWED HER TO TWINE ABOUT HIS BROW THIS SPURIOUS BAY OF SPANISH SCHOLARSHIP HE LET IT GRACE HIS CONQUERING HEAD

I WILL UNDERTAKE TO BREAK THAT RECORD TO MORROW I WILL TAKE YOU TO SHAMROCK JOLNES I WILL UNMASK HIM BEFORE YOU AND PROVE TO YOU THAT IT IS NOT AN IMPOSSIBILITY FOR AN OFFICER OF THE LAW AND A MANSLAYER TO STAND FACE TO FACE IN YOUR CITY
UNAFFECTED SINCERITY THAT WAS REDEEMED FROM BLUFFNESS ONLY BY ITS EXQUISITE CALCULATION WITH THAT PROMPTITUDE AND MASTERLY DECISION OF MANNER THAT SO WELL SUITED HIS CALLING WITH ALL HIS STOCK IN TRADE WELL TO THE FRONT
UNTIL NOW HE HAD BEEN HOPING TO STRIKE THE TRAIL THAT LED TO THE FRIO CROSSING AND THE CHAPMAN RANCH HE MUST HAVE CROSSED IT AT SOME DIM PART OF IT AND RIDDEN BEYOND IF SO HE WAS NOW SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY MILES FROM HOME
SAM WAS GOING TO RIDE OVER TO THE CHAPMAN RANCH TO SEE ABOUT BUYING SOME MORE IMPROVED MERINO RAMS AT LENGTH HE CAME OUT READY FOR HIS RIDE THIS BEING A BUSINESS TRIP OF SOME IMPORTANCE

I COULD NOT HELP EXCLAIMING AS OUR CAB STARTED ON ITS RETURN TRIP BUT HOW DID YOU DO IT BY WHAT PROCESS OF INDUCTION MY DEAR DOCTOR INTERRUPTED THE GREAT MURDERER THE INDUCTIVE THEORY IS WHAT THE DETECTIVES USE MY PROCESS IS MORE MODERN
HE LOOKED RATHER TO BE AN OLD COURTIER HANDED DOWN FROM THE REIGN OF CHARLES AND RE ATTIRED IN A MODERN SUIT OF FINE BUT RAVELING AND SEAM WORN BROADCLOTH YES SIR SAID MISTER BLOOM IN HIS HEARTIEST PROSPECTUS VOICE
THE PRICE OF LOTS RANGED FROM FIVE TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS POSITIVELY NO LOT WOULD BE PRICED HIGHER THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS
I AM A GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA AND MISSUS BLAYLOCK'S REALLY WONDERFUL ACQUAINTANCE WITH BELLES LETTRES AND POETIC LITERATURE
WANTER FIGHT ABOUT IT DO YER SAID HENRY WILLIAMS JUMPING UP AND CRACKING HIS HEELS TOGETHER TWICE ALL RIGHT HUNKY SAIL IN AND CUT YER CAPERS KEEP YOUR CLOTHES ON SAID MISTER BLOOM I'M ONLY GOING DOWN TO THE BANK
I WAS WALKING IN CENTRAL PARK WITH AVERY KNIGHT THE GREAT NEW YORK BURGLAR HIGHWAYMAN AND MURDERER BUT MY DEAR KNIGHT SAID I IT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE
FOR WHEN HE SAW THAT SWIFT LIMPID UPWARD LOOK THAT SHE GAVE THE MAN WHEN HE TOOK HER HAND HE KNEW HIMSELF TO BE FORGOTTEN ONCE THAT SAME LOOK HAD BEEN RAISED TO HIM AND HE HAD GAUGED ITS MEANING
OKOCHEE TRUE TO THE INSTINCT OF ITS BLOOD AND CLIME WAS LULLED BY THE SPELL IT CLIMBED OUT OF THE ARENA LOOSED ITS SUSPENDER SAT DOWN AGAIN ON THE POST OFFICE STOOP AND TOOK A CHEW
MY SPIRIT DRIFTS IN LONGING SWEET BACK TO THE GEORGIA HILLS AND THROUGH THE CLOSE DRAWN CURTAINED NIGHT I STEAL ON SLEEP'S SLOW WINGS
MISSUS BLAYLOCK BLUSHING LIKE A GIRL SHOOK HER CURL AND GAVE THE COLONEL AN ARCH REPROVING TAP SECRET OF ETERNAL YOUTH WHERE ART THOU EVERY SECOND THE ANSWER COMES HERE HERE
AND THE INHABITANTS HAD TO BE FURNISHED WITH ANOTHER MONTH'S HOMELY RATIONS AS PER AGREEMENT AND THEN SKYLAND WOULD KNOW J PINKNEY BLOOM NO MORE THE OWNERS OF THESE PRECIPITOUS BARREN USELESS LOTS
THERE WAS A BIG LUMP IN HIS THROAT AS HE THOUGHT OF THE CROSS WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HIS WIFE SURELY IT WAS HARD ENOUGH FOR HER TO LIVE IN THAT HORRIBLE COUNTRY WITHOUT HAVING TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF HIS ABUSE HE CURSED HIMSELF GRIMLY AND FELT A SUDDEN FLUSH OF SHAME THAT
HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF THAT HER PALENESS WAS FROM THOUGHTS OF ANOTHER THAN THE MAN TO WHOM SHE WAS ABOUT TO GIVE HERSELF BUT EVEN THAT POOR CONSOLATION HAD BEEN WRENCHED FROM HIM
MISTER BLOOM STRAYED THOUGHTFULLY BACK TO THE CAPTAIN AND STOOD MEDITATING OUGHT TO BE IN SIGHT OF THE SPIRES AND GILDED DOMES OF SKYLAND NOW IN A FEW MINUTES CHIRRUPED MAC FARLAND SHAKING WITH ENJOYMENT GO TO THE DEVIL SAID MISTER BLOOM STILL PENSIVE
HUMBLED NOW HE SOUGHT THE ANSWER AMID THE RUINS OF HIS SELF CONCEIT IF THE VOICE OF THE OTHER MAN IN THE ROOM QUERULOUSLY INTRUDING UPON HIS THOUGHTS AROUSED HIM
THE NEXT DAY HE WAITED IMPATIENT IN HIS ROOMS FOR THE WORD AT NOON HER GROOM CAME TO THE DOOR AND LEFT THE STRANGE CACTUS IN THE RED EARTHEN JAR THERE WAS NO NOTE NO MESSAGE
REMOVING HIS WIDE BRIMMED RATHER SHAPELESS BLACK FELT HAT IS IN HOLLY SPRINGS HOLLY SPRINGS GEORGIA I AM VERY PROUD TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE MISTER BLOOM
IN SPITE OF THEIR BICKERINGS WHEN NIGHT CAME MARTHY WAS WONT TO DISMISS HER FEARS OF THE COUNTRY AND REST HER HEAD UPON SAM'S STRONG ARM WITH A SIGH OF PEACEFUL CONTENT AND DEPENDENCE AND WERE HER FEARS SO GROUNDLESS
PERHAPS I CAN REPEAT A VERSE OR TWO THE LILY SPRINGS FROM THE ROTTING MOULD PEARLS FROM THE DEEP SEA SLIME GOOD WILL COME OUT OF NAZARETH ALL IN GOD'S OWN TIME TO THE HARDEST HEART THE SOFTENING GRACE COMETH AT LAST TO BLESS
HE HAD SUDDENLY FOUND HIMSELF CONFRONTED BY A THING HE HAD NEVER BEFORE FACED
IT WAS A MERE NOTHING FOR A CATTLEMAN OR A SHEEPMAN TO BE LOST FOR A DAY OR A NIGHT THE THING OFTEN HAPPENED IT WAS MERELY A MATTER OF MISSING A MEAL OR TWO AND SLEEPING COMFORTABLY ON YOUR SADDLE BLANKETS ON A SOFT MATTRESS OF MESQUITE GRASS
GUIDED BY THE INDEFATIGABLE PROMOTER THEY SLOWLY CLIMBED THE STEEP HILLSIDE PAUSING OFTEN TO REST AND ADMIRE THE VIEW FINALLY THEY ENTERED THE VILLAGE OF COLD BRANCH WARMLY BOTH THE COLONEL AND HIS WIFE PRAISED IT FOR ITS HOMELIKE AND PEACEFUL BEAUTY
BUT THEY HAD BEEN ENOUGH AND THEY HAD BROUGHT HIM TO SPEAK DURING THEIR CONVERSATION SHE HAD SAID AND CAPTAIN CARRUTHERS TELLS ME THAT YOU SPEAK THE SPANISH LANGUAGE LIKE A NATIVE WHY HAVE YOU HIDDEN THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT FROM ME
AND IT IS NOT PAST BELIEF THAT ONE MAY REVIEW AN ENTIRE COURTSHIP WHILE REMOVING ONE'S GLOVES
THEY WERE ALL YOURS OF COURSE I HATE TO MENTION THESE THINGS BUT OH COME NOW J P SAID THE CAPTAIN YOU KNOW I WAS JUST FOOLING I'LL PUT YOU OFF AT COLD BRANCH IF YOU SAY SO THE OTHER PASSENGERS GET OFF THERE TOO SAID MISTER BLOOM
WITHOUT PRELIMINARY OR AFFECTATION OR DEMURRAL SHE BEGAN IN RATHER THRILLING AND MORE DEEPLY PITCHED TONES TO RECITE THESE LINES THE GEORGIA HILLS
I KNOW SOMETHING OF DETECTIVES METHODS AND I FOLLOWED OUT A FEW OF THEM EXPECTING TO FIND JOLNES AT THE OTHER END
AND A COUPLE OF DOZEN COPS MY DEAR DOCTOR SAID KNIGHT A LITTLE STIFFLY I WOULD REMIND YOU THAT I AM NO GAMBLER
BUT I HAVE NOT YET LOST FAITH IN HUMANITY IF I HAVE BEEN DECEIVED AGAIN STILL WE MAY GLEAN HEALTH AND CONTENT IF NOT WORLDLY PROFIT I AM AWARE THAT THERE ARE DISHONEST SCHEMERS IN THE WORLD WHO SET TRAPS FOR THE UNWARY
MARTHY LEISURELY ROCKING IN HER CHAIR FIXED HER PLACE IN THE BOOK WITH HER FINGER AND TURNED HER HEAD SMILING MISCHIEVOUSLY AS SHE NOTED THE HAVOC SAM HAD WROUGHT WITH HIS APPEARANCE IN TRYING TO FIX UP
THE PERPETRATOR WOULD NEVER BE DISCOVERED DO YOU NOT THINK MY POSTULATION JUSTIFIED BY PRECEDENT
AND WAS PROVIDED WITH LONG TENTACULAR LEAVES THAT PERPETUALLY SWAYED WITH THE SLIGHTEST BREEZE WITH A PECULIAR BECKONING MOTION TRYSDALE'S FRIEND THE BROTHER OF THE BRIDE
HE DREW EIGHT ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS FROM HIS MONEY BELT AND PLANKED THEM DOWN ON THE COUNTER MISTER COOLY SHOWED SIGNS OF FUTURE PROMISE FOR HE ALREADY HAD THE DEED SPREAD OUT AND WAS REACHING ACROSS THE COUNTER FOR THE INK BOTTLE
COLONEL BLAYLOCK ROSE AND MADE A BOW
THE LITTLE STEAMBOAT DIXIE BELLE WAS ABOUT TO SHOVE OFF ON HER REGULAR UP THE LAKE TRIP WHEN A RICKETY HIRED CARRIAGE RATTLED UP TO THE PIER AND A TALL ELDERLY GENTLEMAN IN BLACK STEPPED OUT
THE GRASS UPON THEIR ORCHARD SIDES IS A FINE COUCH TO ME THE COMMON NOTE OF EACH SMALL BIRD PASSES ALL MINSTRELSY IT WOULD NOT SEEM SO DREAD A THING IF WHEN THE REAPER WILLS HE MIGHT COME THERE AND TAKE MY HAND UP IN THE GEORGIA HILLS
FROM THIS LAST HOPELESS POINT OF VIEW HE STILL STROVE AS IF IT HAD BECOME A HABIT OF HIS MIND TO REACH SOME CONJECTURE AS TO WHY AND HOW HE HAD LOST HER SHAKEN RUDELY BY THE UNCOMPROMISING FACT
MIGHT COME AND VIEW THE SCENE OF THEIR INVESTED CREDULITY OR THEY MIGHT LEAVE THEM TO THEIR FIT TENANTS THE WILD HOG AND THE BROWSING DEER THE WORK OF THE SKYLAND REAL ESTATE COMPANY WAS FINISHED
IN WHAT PARTICULAR LINE OF BUSINESS YOU INSERTED YOUR COIN I KNOW THAT TOWN AS WELL AS I KNOW THE REGULATIONS FOR ILLEGAL USE OF THE MAILS I MIGHT GIVE YOU A HUNCH AS TO WHETHER YOU CAN MAKE THE GAME GO OR NOT
SAID J PINKNEY SUDDENLY I WANT YOU TO STOP AT COLD BRANCH THERE'S A LANDING THERE THAT THEY MADE TO USE SOMETIMES WHEN THE RIVER WAS UP CAN'T SAID THE CAPTAIN GRINNING MORE BROADLY I'VE GOT THE UNITED STATES MAILS ON BOARD
DURING AN EARLY PERIOD OF DEVELOPMENT HAVING NO RELATION TO REVERSION YET SUCH VARIATIONS MIGHT BE PRESERVED AND ACCUMULATED IF IN ANY WAY SERVICEABLE FOR INSTANCE
WE HAVE THEN TO ENQUIRE WHETHER SUCH CHOICE CONTINUED DURING MANY GENERATIONS WOULD PRODUCE ANY SENSIBLE EFFECT ON THE RACE
NO TRACE OF IT IN ONLY TWO OUT OF THIRTY FEMALE SUBJECTS WAS THIS MUSCLE DEVELOPED ON BOTH SIDES BUT IN THREE OTHERS THE RUDIMENTARY LIGAMENT WAS PRESENT THIS MUSCLE THEREFORE APPEARS TO BE MUCH MORE COMMON IN THE MALE THAN IN THE FEMALE SEX
IF NORMALLY PRESENT IN THE HUMAN EMBRYO THEY BECOME ABNORMALLY DEVELOPED ALTHOUGH IN A MANNER WHICH IS NORMAL IN THE LOWER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP THESE REMARKS WILL BE RENDERED CLEARER BY THE FOLLOWING ILLUSTRATIONS IN VARIOUS MAMMALS
DELIGHT TO FRISK ON ANY HILLOCK HOWEVER SMALL IDIOTS ALSO RESEMBLE THE LOWER ANIMALS IN SOME OTHER RESPECTS THUS SEVERAL CASES ARE RECORDED OF THEIR CAREFULLY SMELLING EVERY MOUTHFUL OF FOOD BEFORE EATING IT
THIS SAME AUTHOR SAYS THAT THE UNION OF THE TWO SEXES HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN ABOUT TWENTY SPECIES AND HE ASSERTS POSITIVELY THAT THE FEMALE REJECTS SOME OF THE MALES WHO COURT HER THREATENS THEM WITH OPEN MANDIBLES AND AT LAST AFTER LONG HESITATION ACCEPTS THE CHOSEN ONE
THEY CERTAINLY DISCOVER FLOWERS BY COLOUR THE HUMMING BIRD SPHINX MAY OFTEN BE SEEN TO SWOOP DOWN FROM A DISTANCE ON A BUNCH OF FLOWERS IN THE MIDST OF GREEN FOLIAGE AND I HAVE BEEN ASSURED BY TWO PERSONS ABROAD THAT THESE MOTHS REPEATEDLY VISIT FLOWERS PAINTED ON THE WALLS OF A ROOM
AS THE HIND WINGS ARE THEN FULLY EXPOSED TO VIEW
THEY ADMIRE SOLELY WHAT THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO
THAT SETINA PRODUCES A SOUND LIKE THE TICKING OF A WATCH APPARENTLY BY THE AID OF TWO LARGE TYMPANIFORM VESICLES SITUATED IN THE PECTORAL REGION AND THESE ARE MUCH MORE DEVELOPED IN THE MALE THAN IN THE FEMALE
AND OF THE RIDICULE WHICH HE EXCITED WHEN HE SOLD HIS TEMBETA THE LARGE COLOURED PIECE OF WOOD WHICH IS PASSED THROUGH THE HOLE IN CENTRAL AFRICA THE WOMEN PERFORATE THE LOWER LIP AND WEAR A CRYSTAL WHICH FROM THE MOVEMENT OF THE TONGUE HAS A WRIGGLING MOTION
IN WHICH TWO BROTHERS EXHIBITED THIS PECULIARITY
OR HAVE SUCCESSIVE VARIATIONS BEEN ACCUMULATED AND DETERMINED AS A PROTECTION OR FOR SOME UNKNOWN PURPOSE OR THAT ONE SEX MAY BE ATTRACTIVE TO THE OTHER
THE INFLUENCE OF BEAUTY IN DETERMINING THE MARRIAGES OF MANKIND IN CIVILISED LIFE MAN IS LARGELY BUT BY NO MEANS EXCLUSIVELY INFLUENCED IN THE CHOICE OF HIS WIFE BY EXTERNAL APPEARANCE BUT WE ARE CHIEFLY CONCERNED WITH PRIMEVAL TIMES
CORRELATED VARIATION IN MAN AS IN THE LOWER ANIMALS MANY STRUCTURES ARE SO INTIMATELY RELATED THAT WHEN ONE PART VARIES SO DOES ANOTHER
IS COLOURED MORE BRIGHTLY AND DIVERSELY THAN THE LOWER HENCE THE LOWER SURFACE GENERALLY AFFORDS TO ENTOMOLOGISTS THE MORE USEFUL CHARACTER FOR DETECTING THE AFFINITIES OF THE VARIOUS SPECIES FRITZ MUELLER INFORMS ME THAT THREE SPECIES OF CASTNIA
THAT WHEN THE SEXES OF BUTTERFLIES DIFFER THE MALE AS A GENERAL RULE IS THE MORE BEAUTIFUL AND DEPARTS MORE FROM THE USUAL TYPE OF COLOURING OF THE GROUP TO WHICH THE SPECIES BELONGS HENCE IN MOST GROUPS THE FEMALES OF THE SEVERAL SPECIES RESEMBLE EACH OTHER MUCH MORE CLOSELY THAN DO THE MALES
ON THE OTHER HAND IF MAN IS DESCENDED FROM SOME APE LIKE CREATURE
BEARING IN MIND HOW MANY SUBSTANCES CLOSELY ANALOGOUS TO NATURAL ORGANIC COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN RECENTLY FORMED BY CHEMISTS
THE CHINESE IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY ACCUSTOMED TO THE FLAT FEATURES OF THE MONGOL RACES WERE SURPRISED AT THE PROMINENT NOSES OF THE CINGALESE AND THSANG DESCRIBED THEM AS HAVING THE BEAK OF A BIRD WITH THE BODY OF A MAN FINLAYSON
IN VARIOUS CRUSTACEANS BELONGING TO DISTINCT FAMILIES THE ANTERIOR ANTENNAE ARE FURNISHED WITH PECULIAR THREAD LIKE BODIES
IN WHICH BOTH SEXES ARE NEARLY ALIKE AND WONDERFULLY SPLENDID IN ANOTHER SPECIES THE MALE IS COLOURED IN A SIMILARLY GORGEOUS MANNER WHILST THE WHOLE UPPER SURFACE OF THE FEMALE IS OF A DULL UNIFORM BROWN OUR COMMON LITTLE ENGLISH BLUE BUTTERFLIES OF THE GENUS LYCAENA
EXCEPT WHERE ONE SEX IS MUCH MORE BRILLIANTLY OR CONSPICUOUSLY COLOURED THAN THE OTHER AND WHERE THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN HABITS BETWEEN THE SEXES SUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR DIFFERENT COLOURS
CONSTITUTING THE MOLLUSCOIDA OF SOME AUTHORS FOR MOST OF THESE ANIMALS ARE PERMANENTLY AFFIXED TO A SUPPORT OR HAVE THEIR SEXES UNITED IN THE SAME INDIVIDUAL IN THE LAMELLIBRANCHIATA OR BIVALVE SHELLS HERMAPHRODITISM IS NOT RARE
ARE THUS INTIMATELY CONNECTED HOMOLOGOUS STRUCTURES ARE PARTICULARLY LIABLE TO CHANGE TOGETHER AS WE SEE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE BODY
IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES THE TEETH ARE STAINED BLACK RED BLUE ET CETERA AND IN THE MALAY ARCHIPELAGO IT IS THOUGHT SHAMEFUL TO HAVE WHITE TEETH LIKE THOSE OF A DOG NOT ONE GREAT COUNTRY CAN BE NAMED FROM THE POLAR REGIONS IN THE NORTH TO NEW ZEALAND IN THE SOUTH
YET IN MANY SPECIES IT IS AS HIGHLY DECORATED AS THE UPPER SURFACE
THAT A COMPLEX PART ARRESTED AT AN EARLY PHASE OF EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT SHOULD GO ON GROWING SO AS ULTIMATELY TO PERFORM ITS PROPER FUNCTION UNLESS IT HAD ACQUIRED SUCH POWER DURING SOME EARLIER STATE OF EXISTENCE WHEN THE PRESENT EXCEPTIONAL
BUT IT MAY BE DOUBTED WHETHER BARBAROUS NATIONS HAVE GENERALLY HAD ANY SUCH INTENTION IN PAINTING THEMSELVES IN THE FASHIONS OF OUR OWN DRESS WE SEE EXACTLY THE SAME PRINCIPLE AND THE SAME DESIRE TO CARRY EVERY POINT TO AN EXTREME WE EXHIBIT ALSO THE SAME SPIRIT OF EMULATION
FROM THE SEVERAL FOREGOING FACTS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ADMIT THAT THE BRILLIANT COLOURS OF BUTTERFLIES AND OF SOME FEW MOTHS HAVE COMMONLY BEEN ACQUIRED FOR THE SAKE OF PROTECTION
FROM THESE SEVERAL CONSIDERATIONS WE MAY ADMIT WITH SOME CONFIDENCE THAT THE WELL MARKED DIFFERENCES IN COLOUR BETWEEN THE SEXES OF CERTAIN SPECIES ARE THE RESULTS OF SEXUAL SELECTION THOUGH WE HAVE NOT HERE THE BEST KIND OF EVIDENCE THE DISPLAY BY THE MALE OF HIS ORNAMENTS
IN REICHERT'S AND DU BOIS REYMOND'S ARCHIV EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO P THREE HUNDRED FOUR IN ONE OF THE CASES ALLUDED TO BY DOCTOR BARTELS A MAN BORE FIVE MAMMAE ONE BEING MEDIAL AND PLACED ABOVE THE NAVEL
ALL OF WHICH PLAINLY REPRESENTED MUSCLES PROPER TO VARIOUS KINDS OF APES THIS MAN FOR INSTANCE HAD ON BOTH SIDES OF HIS NECK A TRUE AND POWERFUL
LASTLY IT IS A REMARKABLE FACT AS PROVED BY THE FOREGOING QUOTATIONS THAT THE SAME FASHIONS IN MODIFYING THE SHAPE OF THE HEAD IN ORNAMENTING THE HAIR IN PAINTING TATTOOING IN PERFORATING THE NOSE LIPS OR EARS
ARE THE PURPOSELESS RESULT OF THE NATURE OF THE TISSUES AND OF THE ACTION OF THE SURROUNDING CONDITIONS
I HAVE MET WITH VERY FEW STATEMENTS OPPOSED TO THIS CONCLUSION
AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SOME CONTINENTAL AND ENGLISH BREEDERS DOCTOR WALLACE WHO HAS HAD GREAT EXPERIENCE IN BREEDING BOMBYX CYNTHIA IS CONVINCED THAT THE FEMALES EVINCE NO CHOICE OR PREFERENCE HE HAS KEPT ABOVE THREE HUNDRED OF THESE MOTHS TOGETHER
THE NEGROES ADMIRE A VERY BLACK SKIN MORE THAN ONE OF A LIGHTER TINT BUT THEIR HORROR OF WHITENESS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED ACCORDING TO THIS SAME TRAVELLER PARTLY TO THE BELIEF HELD BY MOST NEGROES THAT DEMONS AND SPIRITS ARE WHITE AND PARTLY TO THEIR THINKING IT A SIGN OF ILL HEALTH
IT IS QUITE INCREDIBLE
IT SOMETIMES REMAINS THUS IN MAN WHEN ADULT MORE ESPECIALLY IN THE LOWER PROGNATHOUS RACES HENCE CANESTRINI CONCLUDES THAT SOME ANCIENT PROGENITOR OF MAN MUST HAVE HAD THIS BONE NORMALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO PORTIONS WHICH AFTERWARDS BECAME FUSED TOGETHER
IT WOULD NATURALLY BE THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE A SOURCE OF DANGER BUT MISTER J JENNER WEIR BELIEVES THAT IT ACTUALLY SERVES THEM AS A MEANS OF ESCAPE FOR BIRDS STRIKE AT THESE BRIGHTLY COLOURED AND FRAGILE SURFACES INSTEAD OF AT THE BODY
IN WHICH THE SEXES ARE SEPARATE SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF THE PRESENT KIND
AND EVIDENTLY THINKING THAT THEY MIGHT LIKEWISE ROLL IN CARRIED THEM TO THE SPOT WHERE IT HAD LAID THE FIRST IT WOULD I THINK BE DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH THIS ACT FROM ONE PERFORMED BY MAN BY THE AID OF REASON
IN REMOVING OR FILING THE TEETH ET CETERA NOW PREVAIL AND HAVE LONG PREVAILED IN THE MOST DISTANT QUARTERS OF THE WORLD IT IS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE THAT THESE PRACTICES FOLLOWED BY SO MANY DISTINCT NATIONS SHOULD BE DUE TO TRADITION FROM ANY COMMON SOURCE
ARRESTS OF DEVELOPMENT THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT AND ARRESTED GROWTH FOR PARTS IN THE FORMER STATE CONTINUE TO GROW WHILST STILL RETAINING THEIR EARLY CONDITION VARIOUS MONSTROSITIES COME UNDER THIS HEAD AND SOME AS A CLEFT PALATE
HENCE I AM LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE FEMALES PREFER OR ARE MOST EXCITED BY THE MORE BRILLIANT MALES FOR ON ANY OTHER SUPPOSITION THE MALES WOULD AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE BE ORNAMENTED TO NO PURPOSE WE KNOW THAT ANTS AND CERTAIN LAMELLICORN BEETLES ARE CAPABLE OF FEELING AN ATTACHMENT FOR EACH OTHER
IT DESERVES ESPECIAL NOTICE THAT THE MALES DO NOT ACQUIRE THEIR BRIGHT COLOURS UNTIL THEY BECOME MATURE THEY APPEAR TO BE MUCH MORE NUMEROUS THAN THE FEMALES
WERE PLACED TOGETHER IN A GLASS VESSEL BY FRITZ MUELLER THEY MUTILATED AND KILLED ONE ANOTHER
THOUGH NOT IN SO STRIKING A MANNER AS THE ABOVE EXOTIC GENERA
HAVING MADE THESE PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE ADMIRATION FELT BY SAVAGES FOR VARIOUS ORNAMENTS AND FOR DEFORMITIES MOST UNSIGHTLY IN OUR EYES LET US SEE HOW FAR THE MEN ARE ATTRACTED BY THE APPEARANCE OF THEIR WOMEN
BUT THE FASHIONS OF SAVAGES ARE FAR MORE PERMANENT THAN OURS AND WHENEVER THEIR BODIES ARE ARTIFICIALLY MODIFIED THIS IS NECESSARILY THE CASE THE ARAB WOMEN OF THE UPPER NILE OCCUPY ABOUT THREE DAYS IN DRESSING THEIR HAIR THEY NEVER IMITATE OTHER TRIBES
I AM INFORMED BY DOCTOR ZOUTEVEEN THAT THERE IS A CASE ON RECORD OF A MAN HAVING TWENTY FOUR FINGERS AND TWENTY FOUR TOES I WAS CHIEFLY LED TO THE CONCLUSION
THEY OFTEN ASCEND STAIRS ON ALL FOURS AND ARE CURIOUSLY FOND OF CLIMBING UP FURNITURE OR TREES WE ARE THUS REMINDED OF THE DELIGHT SHEWN BY ALMOST ALL BOYS IN CLIMBING TREES AND THIS AGAIN REMINDS US HOW LAMBS AND KIDS ORIGINALLY ALPINE ANIMALS
ACCORDING TO MY THEORY EVERY TRANSIENT CONDITION OF AN ORGAN DURING ITS DEVELOPMENT IS NOT ONLY A MEANS TO AN END BUT ONCE WAS AN END IN ITSELF THIS DOES NOT SEEM TO ME NECESSARILY TO HOLD GOOD WHY SHOULD NOT VARIATIONS OCCUR
DO NOT SEEK CONCEALMENT WHILST AGAIN SOME EQUALLY CONSPICUOUS SPECIES AS WELL AS OTHER DULL COLOURED KINDS LIVE UNDER STONES AND IN DARK RECESSES
AND THESE ARE MUCH MORE NUMEROUS IN THE MALES THAN IN THE FEMALES AS THE MALES WITHOUT ANY UNUSUAL DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR OLFACTORY ORGANS
FOR INSTANCE MISTER WEIR TURNED INTO HIS AVIARY A VIGOROUS SPECIMEN OF TRIPHAENA PRONUBA WHICH WAS INSTANTLY PURSUED BY A ROBIN BUT THE BIRD'S ATTENTION BEING CAUGHT BY THE COLOURED WINGS
THAT IT WAS DESCRIBED BY CUVIER AS A PARASITIC WORM UNDER THE NAME OF HECTOCOTYLE BUT THIS MARVELLOUS STRUCTURE MAY BE CLASSED AS A PRIMARY RATHER THAN AS A SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTER ALTHOUGH WITH THE MOLLUSCA SEXUAL SELECTION DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE COME INTO PLAY
NECKLACES ARMLETS EAR RINGS ET CETERA THEY PAINT THEMSELVES IN THE MOST DIVERSIFIED MANNER IF PAINTED NATIONS AS HUMBOLDT OBSERVES HAD BEEN EXAMINED WITH THE SAME ATTENTION AS CLOTHED NATIONS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED THAT THE MOST FERTILE IMAGINATION
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS
THE SEXES IN THESE THREE CASES HAVE THUS BEEN RENDERED NEARLY ALIKE THOUGH IN AN OPPOSITE MANNER IN THE ALLIED GENUS EUBAGIS BOTH SEXES OF SOME OF THE SPECIES ARE PLAIN COLOURED AND NEARLY ALIKE
FOR MANY OF THE OPERATIONS REQUIRE SEVERAL YEARS FOR THEIR COMPLETION
THEIR WINGS BEING DECORATED AS IN OUR BRITISH EMPEROR MOTH
AND ON THE BELIEF IN THE DESCENT OF MAN FROM SOME LOWER FORM THE FACT IS INTELLIGIBLE FOR IT HAS BEEN DETECTED IN SEVERAL OF THE LOWER ANIMALS
IN THE TENTH SPECIES THE FEMALE STILL RETAINS THE SAME GENERAL COLOURING BUT THE MALE RESEMBLES HER SO THAT HE IS COLOURED IN A MUCH LESS GAUDY AND CONTRASTED MANNER THAN THE MALES OF THE PREVIOUS SPECIES IN THE ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH SPECIES THE FEMALES DEPART FROM THE USUAL TYPE
NAMELY THAT THE MALES OF MANY LEPIDOPTERA AT LEAST IN THE IMAGO STATE GREATLY EXCEED THE FEMALES IN NUMBER SOME FACTS HOWEVER ARE OPPOSED TO THE BELIEF THAT FEMALE BUTTERFLIES PREFER THE MORE BEAUTIFUL MALES
AFTER MINUTELY DESCRIBING THE PEOPLE OF COCHIN CHINA SAYS THAT THEIR ROUNDED HEADS AND FACES ARE THEIR CHIEF CHARACTERISTICS AND HE ADDS THE ROUNDNESS OF THE WHOLE COUNTENANCE IS MORE STRIKING IN THE WOMEN WHO ARE RECKONED BEAUTIFUL IN PROPORTION AS THEY DISPLAY THIS FORM OF FACE
OR TO THE MALE HAVING RETAINED OR PERHAPS RECOVERED
THE PERMANENTLY AFFIXED CONDITION OF OTHERS AND THE LOW MENTAL POWERS OF ALL THAT SUCH COLOURS DO NOT SERVE AS A SEXUAL ATTRACTION AND HAVE NOT BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH SEXUAL SELECTION
ARE FREQUENTLY ACCOMPANIED BY POLYDACTYLISM THIS HAS BEEN STRONGLY INSISTED ON BY MECKEL AND ISIDORE GEOFFROY SAINT HILAIRE BUT AT PRESENT IT IS THE SAFEST COURSE TO GIVE UP ALTOGETHER THE IDEA THAT THERE IS ANY RELATION BETWEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUPERNUMERARY DIGITS
AND THAT ANTS RECOGNISE THEIR FELLOWS AFTER AN INTERVAL OF SEVERAL MONTHS HENCE THERE IS NO ABSTRACT IMPROBABILITY IN THE LEPIDOPTERA WHICH PROBABLY STAND NEARLY OR QUITE AS HIGH IN THE SCALE AS THESE INSECTS
SUB KINGDOM OF THE ARTHROPODA CLASS CRUSTACEA IN THIS GREAT CLASS WE FIRST MEET WITH UNDOUBTED SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OFTEN DEVELOPED IN A REMARKABLE MANNER UNFORTUNATELY THE HABITS OF CRUSTACEANS ARE VERY IMPERFECTLY KNOWN
WHY CERTAIN MUSCLES SHOULD NOT SUDDENLY REAPPEAR AFTER AN INTERVAL OF MANY THOUSAND GENERATIONS
ALTHOUGH THE HAIR ON THE HEAD IS THUS CHERISHED THAT ON THE FACE IS CONSIDERED BY THE NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS AS VERY VULGAR
MECKEL VON HEMSBACH THINKS THAT THIS LATTER CASE IS ILLUSTRATED BY A MEDIAL MAMMA OCCURRING IN CERTAIN CHEIROPTERA ON THE WHOLE WE MAY WELL DOUBT IF ADDITIONAL MAMMAE WOULD EVER HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN BOTH SEXES OF MANKIND HAD NOT HIS EARLY PROGENITORS BEEN PROVIDED WITH MORE THAN A SINGLE PAIR
TO SO GREAT A DIFFERENCE THAT IT WAS LONG BEFORE THE TWO WERE PLACED BY ENTOMOLOGISTS IN THE SAME GENUS IN THE THIRD PLACE WE HAVE SEEN THAT WHEN THE SEXES NEARLY RESEMBLE EACH OTHER THIS APPEARS DUE EITHER TO THE MALE HAVING TRANSFERRED HIS COLOURS TO THE FEMALE
MADE IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE BODY AND THESE ARE CONSIDERED BY THE INHABITANTS OF KORDOFAN AND DARFUR
SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS OF THE KIND WHICH WE HAVE TO CONSIDER DO NOT OCCUR AND THIS FACT AGREES WITH THE BELIEF THAT SUCH CHARACTERS IN THE HIGHER CLASSES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED THROUGH SEXUAL SELECTION WHICH DEPENDS ON THE WILL DESIRE AND CHOICE OF EITHER SEX
IN WHICH THE ABORIGINES DO NOT TATTOO THEMSELVES THIS PRACTICE WAS FOLLOWED BY THE JEWS OF OLD AND BY THE ANCIENT BRITONS IN AFRICA SOME OF THE NATIVES TATTOO THEMSELVES BUT IT IS A MUCH MORE COMMON PRACTICE TO RAISE PROTUBERANCES BY RUBBING SALT INTO INCISIONS
AND OUR ONLY MEANS OF FORMING A JUDGMENT ON THIS SUBJECT IS TO STUDY THE HABITS OF EXISTING SEMI CIVILISED AND SAVAGE NATIONS IF IT CAN BE SHEWN THAT THE MEN OF DIFFERENT RACES PREFER WOMEN HAVING VARIOUS CHARACTERISTICS OR CONVERSELY WITH THE WOMEN
AND HOW OFTEN AND HOW CLOSELY THE VARIATIONS RESEMBLE THE NORMAL MUSCLES OF THE LOWER ANIMALS HE SUMS UP BY REMARKING IT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR MY PURPOSE IF I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN SHEWING THE MORE IMPORTANT FORMS WHICH WHEN OCCURRING AS VARIETIES IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT
THAT THE BODY OF THE UTERUS IS FORMED IN MAN WHILE IN THOSE ANIMALS IN WHICH NO MIDDLE PORTION OR BODY EXISTS THE CORNUA REMAIN UNUNITED AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE UTERUS PROCEEDS THE TWO CORNUA BECOME GRADUALLY SHORTER
EACH WITH A WELL CONSTRUCTED ORIFICE AND PASSAGE AND EACH FURNISHED WITH NUMEROUS MUSCLES NERVES GLANDS AND VESSELS IF THEY HAD NOT FORMERLY PASSED THROUGH A SIMILAR COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT AS IN THE CASE OF EXISTING MARSUPIALS
WHICH IS PROVIDED WITH ARTICULATED BONY RAYS ON BOTH SIDES OF A CENTRAL CHAIN OF BONES THERE SEEMS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IN ADMITTING THAT SIX OR MORE DIGITS ON ONE SIDE OR ON BOTH SIDES MIGHT REAPPEAR THROUGH REVERSION
THEY DO NOT ADMIRE A MEDIUM STANDARD
MIGHT UNITE AND LEAVE OFFSPRING WHICH WOULD INHERIT THEIR PARENTS GREATER BEAUTY BUT WITH SUCH LOWLY ORGANISED CREATURES THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE NOR IS IT AT ALL OBVIOUS HOW THE OFFSPRING FROM THE MORE BEAUTIFUL PAIRS OF HERMAPHRODITES WOULD HAVE ANY ADVANTAGE OVER THE OFFSPRING OF THE LESS BEAUTIFUL
MISTER A G BUTLER ALSO INFORMS ME THAT HE HAS SEVERAL TIMES WATCHED A MALE COURTING A FEMALE FOR A FULL QUARTER OF AN HOUR BUT SHE PERTINACIOUSLY REFUSED HIM AND AT LAST SETTLED ON THE GROUND AND CLOSED HER WINGS
FOR BOTH SEXES OF FOUR OR FIVE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED SPECIES ARE COLOURED IN NEARLY THE SAME MANNER AS IN SEVERAL PREVIOUS CASES WE MAY HERE INFER
IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA AND IN AFRICA EITHER THE UPPER OR LOWER LIP IS PIERCED AND WITH THE BOTOCUDOS THE HOLE IN THE LOWER LIP IS SO LARGE THAT A DISC OF WOOD FOUR INCHES IN DIAMETER IS PLACED IN IT
AND ACCORDING TO BURTON THE SOMAL MEN ARE SAID TO CHOOSE THEIR WIVES BY RANGING THEM IN A LINE
WITH THE ANTERIOR PART OF A RICH GREEN SHADING INTO DARK BROWN AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THESE COLOURS ARE LIABLE TO CHANGE IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MINUTES THE WHITE BECOMING DIRTY GREY OR EVEN BLACK THE GREEN LOSING MUCH OF ITS BRILLIANCY
AND MUCH TOO LOW MENTAL POWERS TO APPRECIATE EACH OTHER'S BEAUTY OR OTHER ATTRACTIONS OR TO FEEL RIVALRY
AND YET ARE PROTECTIVE THUS IN THECLA RUBI THE WINGS WHEN CLOSED ARE OF AN EMERALD GREEN AND RESEMBLE THE YOUNG LEAVES OF THE BRAMBLE ON WHICH IN SPRING THIS BUTTERFLY MAY OFTEN BE SEEN SEATED
IT ALSO DESERVES NOTICE THAT IN THOSE GROUPS IN WHICH THE SEXES DIFFER THE FEMALES USUALLY SOMEWHAT RESEMBLE THE MALES SO THAT WHEN THE MALES ARE BEAUTIFUL TO AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE
WITH THE KAFFIRS WHO DIFFER MUCH FROM NEGROES THE SKIN EXCEPT AMONG THE TRIBES NEAR DELAGOA BAY IS NOT USUALLY BLACK THE PREVAILING COLOUR BEING A MIXTURE OF BLACK AND RED THE MOST COMMON SHADE BEING CHOCOLATE DARK COMPLEXIONS AS BEING MOST COMMON
AND BY A STRONGER FANG THAN THE INCISORS NEVERTHELESS THIS TOOTH NO LONGER SERVES MAN AS A SPECIAL WEAPON FOR TEARING HIS ENEMIES OR PREY IT MAY THEREFORE AS FAR AS ITS PROPER FUNCTION IS CONCERNED
ONE IDIOT IS DESCRIBED AS OFTEN USING HIS MOUTH IN AID OF HIS HANDS WHILST HUNTING FOR LICE THEY ARE OFTEN FILTHY IN THEIR HABITS
IS THUS MUCH WEAKENED NEVERTHELESS IT STILL SEEMS TO ME PROBABLE BECAUSE TWO PAIRS ARE OFTEN FOUND SYMMETRICALLY ON THE BREAST AND OF THIS I MYSELF HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION IN SEVERAL CASES IT IS WELL KNOWN
THE SKULL HAS BEEN GREATLY MODIFIED DURING ANCIENT AND MODERN TIMES BY MANY NATIONS
AND TURNING ROUND EXTRACTS THE ALBUMINOUS CORE WITH ITS NARROW POSTERIOR PINCERS BUT THESE ACTIONS ARE PROBABLY INSTINCTIVE
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A STRANGE FACT IF SUBSTANCES SIMILARLY COLOURED HAD NOT OFTEN ORIGINATED INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY USEFUL END THUS GAINED IN THE COMPLEX LABORATORY OF LIVING ORGANISMS THE SUB KINGDOM OF THE MOLLUSCA
IN THE NEXT HIGHER CLASS OF THE GASTEROPODA OR UNIVALVE SHELLS THE SEXES ARE EITHER UNITED OR SEPARATE BUT IN THE LATTER CASE THE MALES NEVER POSSESS SPECIAL ORGANS FOR FINDING SECURING OR CHARMING THE FEMALES
OR AT LEAST IN THE MINDS OF A LARGE PART OF THE RACE ONE OF THESE WAS THE CRAZE FOR GREEK AND LATIN LEARNING AND THE OTHER WAS A DESIRE TO HOLD OFFICE
AND WITH THE DEMAND WILL COME THE ABILITY TO APPRECIATE IT AND TO PROFIT BY IT ABOUT THE TIME THAT WE SUCCEEDED IN BURNING OUR FIRST KILN OF BRICKS WE BEGAN FACING IN AN EMPHASIZED FORM THE OBJECTION
IF YOU WISH FURTHER INFORMATION I SHALL BE GLAD TO FURNISH IT YOURS TRULY BOOKER T WASHINGTON PRINCIPAL THE NEXT MAIL BROUGHT BACK THE FOLLOWING REPLY
THE MINISTRY WAS THE PROFESSION THAT SUFFERED MOST AND STILL SUFFERS THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN GREAT IMPROVEMENT ON ACCOUNT OF NOT ONLY IGNORANT BUT IN MANY CASES IMMORAL MEN WHO CLAIMED THAT THEY WERE
THE BOLDNESS OF WHAT I HAD DONE NEVER DAWNED UPON ME UNTIL I SAW THE PICTURE MADE BY THE RECTOR OF TRINITY CHURCH STANDING BEFORE THAT LARGE AUDIENCE UNDER AN OLD UMBRELLA WAITING FOR THE RAIN TO CEASE SO THAT HE COULD GO ON WITH HIS ADDRESS
WE HAD A PLACE TO COOK AND EAT IN ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY ROUGH AND UNCOMFORTABLE ANY ONE SEEING THE PLACE NOW WOULD NEVER BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ONCE USED FOR A DINING ROOM THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM THOUGH
THE BOARD OF JURORS WAS A LARGE ONE CONTAINING IN ALL OF SIXTY MEMBERS IT WAS ABOUT EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN SOUTHERN WHITE PEOPLE AND NORTHERN WHITE PEOPLE AMONG THEM WERE COLLEGE PRESIDENTS LEADING SCIENTISTS AND MEN OF LETTERS AND SPECIALISTS IN MANY SUBJECTS
WOULD IT BE AGREEABLE TO YOU TO BE ONE OF THE JUDGES OF AWARD IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AT ATLANTA IF SO I SHALL BE GLAD TO PLACE YOUR NAME UPON THE LIST A LINE BY TELEGRAPH WILL BE WELCOMED YOURS VERY TRULY D C GILMAN
BUT TO SHOW THEM HOW TO MAKE THE FORCES OF NATURE AIR WATER STEAM ELECTRICITY HORSE POWER ASSIST THEM IN THEIR LABOUR AT FIRST MANY ADVISED AGAINST THE EXPERIMENT OF HAVING THE BUILDINGS
OFTEN AS IT HAPPENED WHEN DURING THE WEEK I HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN NOT GETTING A CENT FROM THE VERY INDIVIDUALS FROM WHOM I MOST EXPECTED HELP AND WHEN I WAS ALMOST BROKEN DOWN AND DISCOURAGED
HE IS TOO GREAT FOR THAT IN MY CONTACT WITH PEOPLE I FIND THAT AS A RULE IT IS ONLY THE LITTLE NARROW PEOPLE WHO LIVE FOR THEMSELVES WHO NEVER READ GOOD BOOKS WHO DO NOT TRAVEL
MANY OF THE STUDENTS ALSO WERE ABLE TO REMAIN IN SCHOOL BUT A FEW WEEKS AT A TIME BECAUSE THEY HAD SO LITTLE MONEY WITH WHICH TO PAY THEIR BOARD THUS ANOTHER OBJECT WHICH MADE IT DESIRABLE TO GET AN INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM STARTED
WAS TO GET THE BOARDING DEPARTMENT STARTED OFF IN RUNNING ORDER WITH NOTHING TO DO WITH IN THE WAY OF FURNITURE AND WITH NO MONEY WITH WHICH TO BUY ANYTHING THE MERCHANTS IN THE TOWN WOULD LET US HAVE WHAT FOOD WE WANTED ON CREDIT
THIS INCLUDED THE TIME THAT I SPENT AS A STUDENT AT HAMPTON AND AS A TEACHER IN WEST VIRGINIA DURING THE WHOLE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD TWO IDEAS WERE CONSTANTLY AGITATING IN THE MINDS OF THE COLOURED PEOPLE
THIS SPEAKING OF SMALL GIFTS REMINDS ME TO SAY THAT VERY FEW TUSKEGEE GRADUATES FAIL TO SEND US AN ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION THESE CONTRIBUTIONS RANGE FROM TWENTY FIVE CENTS UP TO TEN DOLLARS
GRADUALLY THOUGH I NOTED WITH SATISFACTION THAT A SENTIMENT IN FAVOUR OF WORK WAS GAINING GROUND AFTER A FEW WEEKS OF HARD WORK THE FOUNDATIONS WERE READY AND A DAY WAS APPOINTED FOR THE LAYING OF THE CORNER STONE
STILL WE DECIDED TO GIVE THE NEEDED BUILDING A NAME WE KNEW WE COULD NAME IT EVEN THOUGH WE WERE IN DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO SECURE THE MEANS FOR ITS CONSTRUCTION WE DECIDED TO CALL THE PROPOSED BUILDING ALABAMA HALL
EXCEPT THAT THE PEOPLE HAD CEASED WORK IN THE FIELDS AND WERE LOUNGING ABOUT THEIR HOMES AT NIGHT DURING CHRISTMAS WEEK THEY USUALLY HAD WHAT THEY CALLED A FROLIC IN SOME CABIN ON THE PLANTATION THAT MEANT A KIND OF ROUGH DANCE
OUR NEXT EFFORT WAS IN THE DIRECTION OF INCREASING THE CULTIVATION OF THE LAND
NEW YORK DEAR SIR COMPLYING WITH THE REQUEST WHICH YOU MADE OF ME WHEN I SAW YOU AT YOUR RESIDENCE A FEW DAYS AGO I NOW SUBMIT IN WRITING AN APPEAL FOR A LIBRARY BUILDING FOR OUR INSTITUTION
AFTER CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN COMING INTO CONTACT WITH WEALTHY AND NOTED MEN
I PLACED THE SITUATION FRANKLY BEFORE GENERAL ARMSTRONG WITHOUT HESITATION HE GAVE ME HIS PERSONAL CHECK FOR ALL THE MONEY WHICH HE HAD SAVED FOR HIS OWN USE
THE COMPLAINTS THAT MORNING WERE ESPECIALLY EMPHATIC AND NUMEROUS BECAUSE THE WHOLE BREAKFAST HAD BEEN A FAILURE ONE OF THE GIRLS WHO HAD FAILED TO GET ANY BREAKFAST CAME OUT AND WENT TO THE WELL TO DRAW SOME WATER TO DRINK
IN CONCLUSION MAY I REPEAT THAT NOTHING IN THIRTY YEARS HAS GIVEN US MORE HOPE AND ENCOURAGEMENT
I NEVER WENT TO A WHITE OR A BLACK PERSON IN THE TOWN OF TUSKEGEE FOR ANY ASSISTANCE THAT WAS IN THEIR POWER TO RENDER WITHOUT BEING HELPED ACCORDING TO THEIR MEANS MORE THAN A DOZEN TIMES WHEN BILLS FIGURING UP INTO THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS WERE FALLING DUE
THAN BY THE MANAGERS OF THIS MAGNIFICENT EXPOSITION AT EVERY STAGE OF ITS PROGRESS IT IS A RECOGNITION THAT WILL DO MORE TO CEMENT THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE TWO RACES THAN ANY OCCURRENCE SINCE THE DAWN OF OUR FREEDOM
AS SOON AS THE PLANS WERE DRAWN FOR THE NEW BUILDING THE STUDENTS BEGAN DIGGING OUT THE EARTH WHERE THE FOUNDATIONS WERE TO BE LAID WORKING AFTER THE REGULAR CLASSES WERE OVER
STILL A LARGE PROPORTION TOOK UP TEACHING OR PREACHING AS AN EASY WAY TO MAKE A LIVING MANY BECAME TEACHERS WHO COULD DO LITTLE MORE THAN WRITE THEIR NAMES
THE ADDRESS WAS A REVELATION THE WHOLE SPEECH IS A PLATFORM UPON WHICH BLACKS AND WHITES CAN STAND WITH FULL JUSTICE TO EACH OTHER THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT SAID EDITORIALLY
AND HOW HE COULD TEACH THE CHILDREN CONCERNING THE SUBJECT HE EXPLAINED HIS POSITION IN THE MATTER BY SAYING THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO TEACH THAT THE EARTH WAS EITHER FLAT OR ROUND ACCORDING TO THE PREFERENCE OF A MAJORITY OF HIS PATRONS
AND WITHOUT OPPORTUNITY FOR DOUBLE DEALING OR EVASION TO BOTH RACES ALIKE ANY OTHER COURSE MY DAILY OBSERVATION IN THE SOUTH CONVINCES ME WILL BE UNJUST TO THE NEGRO UNJUST TO THE WHITE MAN
WORDS CANNOT DESCRIBE OUR SURPRISE OR THE ENCOURAGEMENT THAT THE GIFT BROUGHT TO US
IN INSTITUTIONS THAT EXIST FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE WORLD BETTER AT ONE TIME WHEN I WAS IN BOSTON I CALLED AT THE DOOR OF A RATHER WEALTHY LADY AND WAS ADMITTED TO THE VESTIBULE AND SENT UP MY CARD
AT THE REQUEST OF MYSELF AND OTHERS HE CONSENTED TO SPEND AN HOUR IN THE NEGRO BUILDING FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPECTING THE NEGRO EXHIBIT AND OF GIVING THE COLOURED PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM AS SOON AS I MET MISTER CLEVELAND I BECAME IMPRESSED WITH HIS SIMPLICITY GREATNESS AND RUGGED HONESTY
BUT NEVER SEEMED HAPPY UNLESS SHE WAS GIVING ALL OF HER STRENGTH TO THE CAUSE WHICH SHE LOVED OFTEN AT NIGHT AFTER SPENDING THE DAY IN GOING FROM DOOR TO DOOR TRYING TO INTEREST PERSONS IN THE WORK AT TUSKEGEE
DURING THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS I HAVE BEEN COMPELLED TO SPEND A LARGE PROPORTION OF MY TIME AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL IN AN EFFORT TO SECURE MONEY TO PROVIDE FOR THE GROWING NEEDS OF THE INSTITUTION
IT MEANS A GREAT DEAL I THINK TO START OFF ON A FOUNDATION WHICH ONE HAS MADE FOR ONE'S SELF WHEN OUR OLD STUDENTS RETURN TO TUSKEGEE NOW AS THEY OFTEN DO
THIS SECOND RULE HAS BEEN THE HARDEST FOR ME TO LIVE UP TO WHEN BILLS ARE ON THE EVE OF FALLING DUE WITH NOT A DOLLAR IN HAND WITH WHICH TO MEET THEM IT IS PRETTY DIFFICULT TO LEARN NOT TO WORRY
IS TO STAND STILL AND KEEP QUIET IF HE IS RIGHT TIME WILL SHOW IT IN THE MIDST OF THE DISCUSSION WHICH WAS GOING ON CONCERNING MY ATLANTA SPEECH I RECEIVED THE LETTER WHICH I GIVE BELOW FROM DOCTOR GILMAN THE PRESIDENT OF JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY
THERE WAS NO INDUSTRIAL TRAINING GIVEN TO THE STUDENTS AND I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF COMPARING THE INFLUENCE OF AN INSTITUTION WITH NO INDUSTRIAL TRAINING WITH THAT OF ONE LIKE THE HAMPTON INSTITUTE THAT EMPHASIZES THE INDUSTRIES
IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN ANY KIND OF UNDERTAKING I THINK THE MAIN THING IS FOR ONE TO GROW TO THE POINT WHERE HE COMPLETELY FORGETS HIMSELF THAT IS TO LOSE HIMSELF IN A GREAT CAUSE
THE ATLANTA EXPOSITION AT WHICH I HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE AN ADDRESS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NEGRO RACE AS STATED IN THE LAST CHAPTER WAS OPENED WITH A SHORT ADDRESS FROM GOVERNOR BULLOCK AFTER OTHER INTERESTING EXERCISES INCLUDING AN INVOCATION FROM BISHOP NELSON OF GEORGIA
I WILL BE VERY GLAD TO PAY THE BILLS FOR THE LIBRARY BUILDING AS THEY ARE INCURRED TO THE EXTENT OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I AM GLAD OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW THE INTEREST I HAVE IN YOUR NOBLE WORK
MADE IT STILL MORE DIFFICULT TO GET THE STUDENTS TO TAKE PART IN THE WORK SEVERAL OF THE TEACHERS HOWEVER WHO HAD BEEN TRAINED IN THE INDUSTRIES AT HAMPTON VOLUNTEERED THEIR SERVICES AND IN SOME WAY WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A THIRD KILN READY FOR BURNING
THE MAKING OF THESE BRICKS TAUGHT ME AN IMPORTANT LESSON IN REGARD TO THE RELATIONS OF THE TWO RACES IN THE SOUTH MANY WHITE PEOPLE WHO HAD HAD NO CONTACT WITH THE SCHOOL AND PERHAPS NO SYMPATHY WITH IT CAME TO US TO BUY BRICKS
HE HAS SEEMED TO ME TO APPROACH AS NEARLY TO THE SPIRIT OF THE MASTER AS ALMOST ANY MAN I EVER MET A LITTLE LATER THERE CAME INTO THE SERVICE OF THE SCHOOL ANOTHER MAN QUITE YOUNG AT THE TIME AND FRESH FROM HAMPTON
TO PASS NOT ONLY UPON THE EXHIBITS OF THE COLOURED SCHOOLS BUT ALSO UPON THOSE OF THE WHITE SCHOOLS I ACCEPTED THE POSITION AND SPENT A MONTH IN ATLANTA IN PERFORMANCE OF THE DUTIES WHICH IT ENTAILED
AND HOW MUCH SUFFERING WOULD RESULT IF WEALTHY PEOPLE WERE TO PART ALL AT ONCE WITH ANY LARGE PROPORTION OF THEIR WEALTH IN A WAY TO DISORGANIZE AND CRIPPLE GREAT BUSINESS ENTERPRISES
CAME TO ME AND SAID THAT HE WOULD GLADLY PUT ALL THE LUMBER NECESSARY TO ERECT THE BUILDING ON THE GROUNDS WITH NO OTHER GUARANTEE FOR PAYMENT THAN MY WORD THAT IT WOULD BE PAID FOR WHEN WE SECURED SOME MONEY
MISS DAVIDSON AND I BOTH WENT NORTH AND ENGAGED IN THE WORK OF RAISING FUNDS FOR THE COMPLETION OF OUR NEW BUILDING ON MY WAY NORTH I STOPPED IN NEW YORK TO TRY TO GET A LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION
YOU SHALL HAVE AT ALL TIMES THE PATIENT SYMPATHETIC HELP OF MY RACE
I SAW OTHER YOUNG MEN WHO RECEIVED SEVENTY FIVE OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH FROM THE GOVERNMENT WHO WERE IN DEBT AT THE END OF EVERY MONTH I SAW MEN WHO BUT A FEW MONTHS PREVIOUS WERE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
ONE MAN MAY GO INTO A COMMUNITY PREPARED TO SUPPLY THE PEOPLE THERE WITH AN ANALYSIS OF GREEK SENTENCES THE COMMUNITY MAY NOT AT THE TIME BE PREPARED FOR OR FEEL THE NEED OF GREEK ANALYSIS
OUR WORK SEEMED TO PLEASE THE TRUSTEES OF THIS FUND AS THEY SOON BEGAN INCREASING THEIR ANNUAL GRANT THIS HAS BEEN ADDED TO FROM TIME TO TIME UNTIL AT PRESENT WE RECEIVE ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY FROM THE FUND
ONE LECTURE BUREAU OFFERED ME FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A NIGHT AND EXPENSES IF I WOULD PLACE MY SERVICES AT ITS DISPOSAL FOR A GIVEN PERIOD
A WEAK AND NARROW MAN WOULD HAVE REASONED THAT ALL THE MONEY WHICH CAME TO TUSKEGEE IN THIS WAY WOULD BE JUST SO MUCH TAKEN FROM THE HAMPTON INSTITUTE BUT NONE OF THESE SELFISH OR SHORT SIGHTED FEELINGS EVER ENTERED THE BREAST OF GENERAL ARMSTRONG
FOR DAYS FROM THE BEGINNING OF OUR WORK TO THE PRESENT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE FEELING AND LOSE NO OPPORTUNITY TO IMPRESS OUR TEACHERS WITH THE SAME IDEA THAT THE SCHOOL WILL ALWAYS BE SUPPORTED IN PROPORTION AS THE INSIDE OF THE INSTITUTION
TO DEPORT HIMSELF MODESTLY IN REGARD TO POLITICAL CLAIMS DEPENDING UPON THE SLOW BUT SURE INFLUENCES THAT PROCEED FROM THE POSSESSION OF PROPERTY INTELLIGENCE AND HIGH CHARACTER FOR THE FULL RECOGNITION OF HIS POLITICAL RIGHTS I THINK THAT THE ACCORDING OF THE FULL EXERCISE OF POLITICAL RIGHTS IS GOING TO BE A MATTER OF NATURAL SLOW GROWTH NOT AN OVER NIGHT GOURD VINE AFFAIR
IF HE WERE INCLINED TO RESIST THE SUMMONS HE WOULD FALL OR BE MADE TO FALL A SECOND OR THIRD TIME IN THE END HE ALWAYS YIELDED TO THE CALL WHILE I WANTED AN EDUCATION BADLY
THEY WANTED MORE COSTLY DRESSES MORE COSTLY HATS AND SHOES IN A WORD WHILE THEIR WANTS HAVE BEEN INCREASED THEIR ABILITY TO SUPPLY THEIR WANTS HAD NOT BEEN INCREASED IN THE SAME DEGREE ON THE OTHER HAND
BUT NOT ALL THE COLOURED PEOPLE WHO WERE IN OFFICE DURING RECONSTRUCTION WERE UNWORTHY OF THEIR POSITIONS BY ANY MEANS SOME OF THEM LIKE THE LATE SENATOR B K BRUCE GOVERNOR PINCHBACK AND MANY OTHERS
PARTICULARLY IN THE BURNING OF THE BRICKS AFTER A GOOD DEAL OF EFFORT WE MOULDED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BRICKS AND PUT THEM INTO A KILN TO BE BURNED THIS KILN TURNED OUT TO BE A FAILURE
THE SIGHT OF THE NEW BUILDING MADE IT A DAY OF THANKSGIVING FOR THEM NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN MISTER BEDFORD CONSENTED TO BECOME ONE OF THE TRUSTEES OF THE SCHOOL AND IN THAT CAPACITY AND AS A WORKER FOR IT
FOR THE REASON THAT I FEARED THAT PEOPLE WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT ONE MORNING I FOUND MYSELF IN PROVIDENCE RHODE ISLAND WITHOUT A CENT OF MONEY WITH WHICH TO BUY BREAKFAST IN CROSSING THE STREET TO SEE A LADY FROM WHOM I HOPED TO GET SOME MONEY
I FELT THAT THE NEGRO WOULD BE THE ONE TO SUFFER FOR THIS IN THE END BESIDES THE GENERAL POLITICAL AGITATION DREW THE ATTENTION OF OUR PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL MATTERS
AS AN ADDITIONAL RESULT HUNDREDS OF MEN ARE NOW SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH WHO RECEIVED THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF MECHANICS WHILE BEING TAUGHT HOW TO ERECT THESE BUILDINGS
THE LAWS OF CHANGELESS JUSTICE BIND OPPRESSOR WITH OPPRESSED AND CLOSE AS SIN AND SUFFERING JOINED WE MARCH TO FATE ABREAST NEARLY SIXTEEN MILLIONS OF HANDS WILL AID YOU IN PULLING THE LOAD UPWARD OR THEY WILL PULL AGAINST YOU THE LOAD DOWNWARD
SOMETHING THAT HAS MADE THE COMMUNITY FEEL THAT IN A DEGREE IT IS INDEBTED TO HIM AND PERHAPS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT DEPENDENT UPON HIM IN THIS WAY PLEASANT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE RACES HAVE BEEN SIMULATED
HE HAS BEEN CONNECTED WITH IT FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS DURING THIS TIME HE HAS BORNE THE SCHOOL UPON HIS HEART NIGHT AND DAY AND IS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN HE IS PERFORMING SOME SERVICE NO MATTER HOW HUMBLE FOR IT
IN ANOTHER FAMILY THEY HAD ONLY A FEW PIECES OF SUGARCANE IN STILL ANOTHER CABIN I FOUND NOTHING BUT A NEW JUG OF CHEAP MEAN WHISKEY WHICH THE HUSBAND AND WIFE WERE MAKING FREE USE OF
AND THE STUDENTS WOULD USE THE MONEY PAID TO THEM TO KEEP THEMSELVES IN SCHOOL
ARE THOSE WHO NEVER GROW EXCITED OR LOSE SELF CONTROL BUT ARE ALWAYS CALM SELF POSSESSED PATIENT AND POLITE I THINK THAT PRESIDENT WILLIAM MC KINLEY IS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF A MAN OF THIS CLASS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN
I HAVE REFERRED TO THE DISPOSITION ON THE PART OF THE WHITE PEOPLE IN THE TOWN OF TUSKEGEE AND VICINITY TO HELP THE SCHOOL FROM THE FIRST I RESOLVED TO MAKE THE SCHOOL A REAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH IT WAS LOCATED
NO RACE CAN PROSPER TILL IT LEARNS THAT THERE IS AS MUCH DIGNITY IN TILLING A FIELD AS IN WRITING A POEM IT IS AT THE BOTTOM OF LIFE WE MUST BEGIN
THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY TIME THAT GENERAL ARMSTRONG HELPED TUSKEGEE IN THIS WAY I DO NOT THINK I HAVE EVER MADE THIS FACT PUBLIC BEFORE DURING THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR'S WORK OF THE SCHOOL
WE NOW OWN AND USE ON OUR FARM AND ABOUT THE SCHOOL DOZENS OF THESE VEHICLES AND EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN BUILT BY THE HANDS OF THE STUDENTS ASIDE FROM THIS WE HELP SUPPLY THE LOCAL MARKET WITH THESE VEHICLES
IN FACT THE OLDEST AND MOST INFLUENTIAL BISHOP IN ONE BRANCH OF THE METHODIST CHURCH SAID THAT MY WORDS WERE FAR TOO MILD VERY SOON PUBLIC SENTIMENT BEGAN MAKING ITSELF FELT IN DEMANDING A PURIFYING OF THE MINISTRY
THIS CUSTOM PREVAILS THROUGHOUT THIS PORTION OF THE SOUTH TO DAY DURING THE DAYS OF SLAVERY IT WAS A CUSTOM QUITE GENERALLY OBSERVED THROUGHOUT ALL THE SOUTHERN STATES TO GIVE THE COLOURED PEOPLE A WEEK OF HOLIDAY AT CHRISTMAS
THEY TRADED WITH US AND WE WITH THEM OUR BUSINESS INTERESTS BECAME INTERMINGLED WE HAD SOMETHING WHICH THEY WANTED THEY HAD SOMETHING WHICH WE WANTED
WE SHALL CONSTITUTE ONE THIRD AND MORE OF THE IGNORANCE AND CRIME OF THE SOUTH OR ONE THIRD ITS INTELLIGENCE AND PROGRESS WE SHALL CONTRIBUTE ONE THIRD TO THE BUSINESS AND INDUSTRIAL PROSPERITY OF THE SOUTH OR WE SHALL PROVE A VERITABLE BODY OF DEATH STAGNATING DEPRESSING RETARDING EVERY EFFORT TO ADVANCE THE BODY POLITIC
STILL I HAD FOLLOWED MY USUAL RULE OF DOING MY DUTY IF I HAD NOT SEEN HIM I SHOULD HAVE FELT UNHAPPY OVER NEGLECT OF DUTY TWO YEARS AFTER THIS VISIT A LETTER CAME TO TUSKEGEE FROM THIS MAN WHICH READ LIKE THIS
DURING THE WHOLE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION PERIOD OUR PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH LOOKED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR EVERYTHING VERY MUCH AS A CHILD LOOKS TO ITS MOTHER THIS WAS NOT UNNATURAL
THE CITY WAS CROWDED WITH COLOURED PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM HAD RECENTLY COME FROM THE SOUTH A LARGE PROPORTION OF THESE PEOPLE HAD BEEN DRAWN TO WASHINGTON BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT THEY COULD LEAD A LIFE OF EASE THERE
SUCH WORK GIVES ONE A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY HUMAN NATURE IT ALSO HAS ITS COMPENSATIONS IN GIVING ONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
ALL THIS MADE A BURDEN WHICH PRESSED DOWN ON US SOMETIMES IT SEEMED AT THE RATE OF A THOUSAND POUNDS TO THE SQUARE INCH IN ALL OUR DIFFICULTIES AND ANXIETIES HOWEVER
WITHOUTE WORDES MO AND DO THEREWITH AS YE HAVE DONE ERE THIS WITH THAT OTHER WHICH THAT NOW SILVER IS THE PRIEST HIM BUSIED

THAT WITH HIS SINGING WALLED THE CITY COULD NEVER SINGE HALF SO WELL AS HE
AND EURYSTHEUS SEEING HIM RAN AGAIN AND HID HIMSELF IN THE JAR
TWO WHO WERE FAMOUS FOR THEIR HUNTING NO TWO COULD BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN THESE TWO WERE THE FIRST WAS ARCAS HE WAS DRESSED IN THE SKIN OF A BEAR HE HAD RED HAIR AND SAVAGE LOOKING EYES
HIGH AS A MAN UPON STILTS WENT GATHERING THE BLOSSOMS OF THE BUSHES FOR HER THEY WENT ON AND THEY CAME AT LAST TO THE PLACE WHERE EPIMETHEUS HAD LEFT THE JAR THAT HELD PANDORA'S DOWER A GREAT STONE JAR IT WAS
STRIFE AND PURSUIT AND FLIGHT TUMULT AND PANIC AND SLAUGHTER THE FIGURE OF FATE WAS THERE DRAGGING A DEAD MAN BY THE FEET
AND ANOTHER WOULD LOOK ANGRY AND A THIRD WOULD GO BACK SULLENLY TO HER WORK WHEN PANDORA WAS ADMIRED OR PRAISED ONCE THE WOMEN WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AND ONE WHO WAS THE WISEST AMONGST THEM SAID
HE DID NOT FORGET THE JAR THAT HERMES HAD LEFT WITH HER ALL THINGS THAT BELONGED TO THE GOLDEN MAID WERE PRECIOUS AND EPIMETHEUS TOOK THE JAR ALONG THE RACE OF MEN AT THE TIME WERE SIMPLE AND CONTENT
AND WENT WITH HERACLES AND AS THEY WENT HERACLES SPOKE TO EACH OF THE HEROES SAYING THAT THEY WERE FORGETTING THE FLEECE OF GOLD THAT THEY HAD SAILED TO GAIN JASON BLUSHED TO THINK THAT HE HAD ALMOST LET GO OUT OF HIS MIND
HE SAW THE FIELD RISING INTO MOUNDS
TIPHYS KNEW ALL ABOUT THE SUN AND WINDS AND STARS AND ALL ABOUT THE SIGNS BY WHICH A SHIP MIGHT BE STEERED AND NAUPLIUS HAD THE LOVE OF POSEIDON THE GOD OF THE SEA AFTERWARD THERE CAME ONE AFTER THE OTHER
THE EARTH BORN MEN AS FAST AS THEY AROSE WENT DOWN BEFORE THE WEAPONS IN THE HANDS OF THEIR BRETHREN
AND AS FIRM AS ONE OF THE IMMORTALS HAD A HEART THAT WAS FILLED WITH HATRED HE LIFTED UP HIS HEAD AND HE SAID WITH A FROWN THERE IS A LION IN NEMEA THAT IS STRONGER AND MORE FIERCE THAN ANY LION KNOWN BEFORE KILL THAT LION
THEY BEGAN TO FELL TREES FOR THE TIMBERS OF THE SHIP THAT WAS TO MAKE THE VOYAGE TO FAR COLCHIS
AND NOW BECAUSE OF HOPE THEY COULD SEE AN END TO THEIR TROUBLES AND THE MEN AND WOMEN ROUSED THEMSELVES IN THE MIDST OF THEIR AFFLICTIONS AND THEY LOOKED TOWARD GLADNESS HOPE
THERE WERE MEN FIGHTING AND WOMEN WATCHING FROM HIGH TOWERS THE AWFUL FIGURE OF THE DARKNESS OF DEATH WAS SHOWN THERE TOO WITH MOURNFUL EYES AND THE DUST OF BATTLES UPON HER SHOULDERS THE OUTER RIM OF THE SHIELD
WONDERFUL TO THE HEROES ARGO LOOKED WITH HER LONG OARS AND HER HIGH SAILS WITH HER TIMBERS PAINTED RED AND GOLD AND BLUE AND WITH A MARVELOUS FIGURE CARVED UPON HER PROW ALL OVER THE SHIP JASON'S EYES WENT
THAT HE HEARD THE VOICE OF HIS WISE AND SUFFERING BROTHER SAYING DO NOT ACCEPT ANY GIFT THAT ZEUS MAY SEND YOU HE ROSE UP AND HE HURRIED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE LEAVING PANDORA PLAYING BY HERSELF
HE WENT WITHIN FAR INTO THE CAVERN HE WENT AND THEN HE CAME TO WHERE HE SAW THE LION IT WAS SLEEPING HERACLES VIEWED THE TERRIBLE BULK OF THE LION AND THEN HE LOOKED UPON HIS OWN KNOTTED HANDS AND ARMS
HOLDING IN HIS HAND HIS BRONZE TOPPED SPEAR HE WOULD HAVE THEM ATTACK THE STRANGERS AND BURN THE ARGO HE WOULD HAVE THE SONS OF PHRIXUS SLAIN FOR BRINGING THEM TO AEA THERE WAS A PROPHECY HE DECLARED
LEFT DOWN HIS TOOLS AND WENT TO SEEK HER HE FOUND PANDORA AND HE TOOK HER BACK TO OLYMPUS AND IN HIS BRAZEN HOUSE SHE STAYS THOUGH SOMETIMES AT THE WILL OF ZEUS SHE GOES DOWN INTO THE WORLD OF MEN
VERY GRAVE AND WISE LOOKED ARGUS ARGUS THE BUILDER OF THE SHIP AND WONDERFUL TO THE HEROES THE SHIP LOOKED NOW THAT ARGUS FOR THEIR VIEWING HAD SET UP THE MAST WITH THE SAILS AND HAD EVEN PUT THE OARS IN THEIR PLACES
THEN AS HE WENT THROUGH THE FOREST HE PULLED UP A YOUNG OAK TREE AND TRIMMED IT AND MADE A CLUB FOR HIMSELF WITH THE LION'S SKIN OVER HIM THAT SKIN THAT NO SPEAR OR ARROW COULD PIERCE
RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE EARTH BORN MEN THE STONE CAME THEY LEAPED UPON IT LIKE HOUNDS STRIKING AT ONE ANOTHER AS THEY CAME TOGETHER SHIELD CRASHED ON SHIELD SPEAR RANG UPON SPEAR AS THEY STRUCK AT EACH OTHER
HUGE AND DARK AGAINST THE SUNSET THE LION ROARED THREE TIMES AND THEN IT WENT WITHIN THE CAVERN AROUND THE MOUTH WERE STREWN THE BONES OF CREATURES IT HAD KILLED AND CARRIED THERE HERACLES LOOKED UPON THEM WHEN HE CAME TO THE CAVERN
A STORY WAS TOLD CASTOR BEGAN IT AND POLYDEUCES ENDED IT AND THE STORY THAT HELEN'S BROTHERS TOLD WAS THE GOLDEN MAID EPIMETHEUS THE TITAN HAD A BROTHER WHO WAS THE WISEST OF ALL BEINGS
CAME THE NOISE OF HAMMERING IN THE STREET WHERE THE METALWORKERS WERE CAME THE NOISE OF BEATING UPON METALS AS THE SMITHS FASHIONED OUT OF BRONZE ARMOR FOR THE HEROES AND SWORDS AND SPEARS EVERY DAY
LEST ONE OF THESE GOLDEN MAIDS SHOULD HOLD ME BACK FROM THE LABORS THAT MAKE GREAT A MAN SO HERACLES SAID
SHOULD SEE AND FEEL ATHENE DRESSED HER IN GARMENTS THAT WERE AS LOVELY AS FLOWERS APHRODITE THE GODDESS OF LOVE PUT A CHARM ON HER LIPS AND IN HER EYES THE GRACES PUT NECKLACES AROUND HER NECK
OR BUILDING HOUSES AND THE WOMEN WOULD LEAVE OFF SPINNING OR WEAVING AND COME AT HIS CALL AND STAND ABOUT AND ADMIRE THE GOLDEN MAID BUT AS TIME WENT BY A CHANGE CAME UPON THE WOMEN ONE WOMAN WOULD WEEP
AND WENT ON THE LEMNIAN LAND HE GATHERED THE HEROES ABOUT HIM AND THEY SEEING HERACLES COME AMONGST THEM CLAMORED TO GO TO HUNT THE WILD BULLS THAT WERE INLAND FROM THE SEA SO FOR ONCE
THE HARBOR OF IOLCUS ON THE NIGHT OF THE DAY HE HAD HELPED TO BRING THEM DOWN JASON HAD A DREAM HE DREAMT THAT SHE WHOM HE HAD SEEN IN THE FOREST WAYS AND AFTERWARD BY THE RIVER ANAURUS APPEARED TO HIM
WHEN SHE SAID THESE WORDS ALL JASON'S BEING BECAME TAUT LIKE THE STRING OF A BOW IT WAS THEN THE HOUR WHEN HUNTSMEN CAST SLEEP FROM THEIR EYES HUNTSMEN WHO NEVER SLEEP AWAY THE END OF THE NIGHT
AND STOOD BEFORE JASON THERE WAS A STORM IN ALL HER BODY HER MOUTH WAS SHAKEN AND A WHOLE LIFE'S TROUBLE WAS IN HER GREAT EYES BEFORE SHE SPOKE JASON CRIED OUT
AND PUT HIS GREAT HANDS UPON ITS THROAT NO GROWL CAME OUT OF ITS MOUTH BUT THE GREAT EYES BLAZED WHILE THE TERRIBLE PAWS TORE AT HERACLES AGAINST THE ROCK HERACLES HELD THE BEAST STRONGLY HE HELD IT CHOKING IT THROUGH THE SKIN THAT WAS ALMOST IMPENETRABLE
JASON CARRYING HIS SHIELD AND SPEAR WENT BEFORE THE KING FROM THE KING'S HAND HE TOOK THE GLEAMING HELMET THAT HELD THE DRAGON'S TEETH THIS HE PUT INTO THE HANDS OF THESEUS WHO WENT WITH HIM
THEIR MOTHER WAS OREITHYIA THE DAUGHTER OF ERECHTHEUS KING OF ATHENS AND THEIR FATHER WAS BOREAS THE NORTH WIND THESE TWO BROTHERS HAD ON THEIR ANKLES WINGS THAT GLEAMED WITH GOLDEN SCALES THEIR BLACK HAIR WAS THICK UPON THEIR SHOULDERS
THE MEN AND WOMEN LOOKED UPON THE BEAUTY OF PANDORA UPON HER LOVELY DRESSES AND HER GOLDEN CROWN AND HER GIRDLE OF FLOWERS WITH WONDER AND DELIGHT EPIMETHEUS WOULD HAVE EVERY ONE ADMIRE AND PRAISE HER
BEAUTIFUL WOULD SHE HAVE SEEMED TO ANY BEING WHO SAW HER BUT NOW SHE HAD STRAYED AWAY FROM THE HOUSES OF MEN AND EPIMETHEUS WAS NOT THERE TO LOOK UPON HER THEN HEPHAESTUS THE LAME ARTISAN OF THE GODS
AND THEIR MOTHER WAS LEDA WHO AFTER THE TWIN BROTHERS HAD ANOTHER CHILD BORN TO HER HELEN FOR WHOSE SAKE THE SONS OF MANY OF JASON'S FRIENDS WERE TO WAGE WAR AGAINST THE GREAT CITY OF TROY
JASON HAD THEM TAKE THE BEAM FROM THE ROOF OF THE PALACE
ARE ALL IN THAT JAR THAT EPIMETHEUS BROUGHT WITH HER WHEN THE WOMAN WHO WAS THOUGHT TO BE WISE SAID THIS
GREATLY THEY REVERENCED PROMETHEUS WHO HAD GIVEN THEM FIRE AND GREATLY THEY REVERENCED THE RACE OF THE TITANS SO WHEN EPIMETHEUS CAME AMONGST THEM
AND THEY BENT OVER TO SEE THEMSELVES MIRRORED IN IT AND THEY SAW THEMSELVES WITH DUSTY AND UNKEMPT HAIR WITH LARGE AND KNOTTED HANDS WITH TROUBLED EYES AND WITH ANXIOUS MOUTHS THEY FROWNED AS THEY LOOKED UPON THEIR IMAGES
HE ISSUED COMMANDS THROUGH HIS HERALDS ORDERING HERACLES TO GO FORTH AT ONCE AND PERFORM THE SECOND OF HIS TASKS IT WAS TO SLAY THE GREAT WATER SNAKE THAT MADE ITS LAIR IN THE SWAMPS OF LERNA
HE HEARD THE CLEAR VOICE OF ATALANTA AS SHE TOO SPOKE TO THE ARGONAUTS WHAT HERACLES SAID WAS BRAVE AND WISE SAID ATALANTA FORGETFULNESS WOULD COVER THEIR NAMES IF THEY STAYED LONGER IN LEMNOS FORGETFULNESS AND SHAME
AND SHE IN HER STRANGE WAY OF SPEAKING SAID WHAT YOU TOLD US I HAVE REMEMBERED HOW YOU WILL COME TO THE DANGEROUS PASSAGE THAT LEADS INTO THE SEA OF PONTUS
ALL ROUND HIM AS FROM A FURNACE THERE CAME SMOKE AND FIRE THE BULLS ROARED MIGHTILY GRASPING THE HORNS OF THE BULL THAT WAS UPON HIS RIGHT HAND JASON DRAGGED HIM UNTIL HE HAD BROUGHT HIM BESIDE THE YOKE OF BRONZE
CHIRON THE CENTAUR HAD MET HIM AS HE WAS WANDERING THROUGH THE FORESTS ON THE MOUNTAIN PELION AND HAD SENT HIM DOWN INTO IOLCUS THEN THERE CAME TWO MEN WELL SKILLED IN THE HANDLING OF SHIPS TIPHYS AND NAUPLIUS
AROUND THESE FIGURES WERE HEADS OF SNAKES HEADS WITH BLACK JAWS AND GLITTERING EYES TWELVE HEADS SUCH AS MIGHT AFFRIGHT ANY MAN
THE MINDLESS TITAN TO FURTHER HIS PLAN WHILE HE PONDERED THERE WAS A HUSH ON HIGH OLYMPUS THE MOUNTAIN OF THE GODS THEN ZEUS CALLED UPON THE ARTISAN OF THE GODS LAME HEPHAESTUS
IN EVERY HOUSE THEY WENT TO EPIMETHEUS WOULD SAY I AM THE BROTHER OF PROMETHEUS WHO GAVE YOU THE GIFT OF FIRE BUT INSTEAD OF GIVING THEM A WELCOME THE MEN WOULD SAY WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOUR RELATION TO PROMETHEUS
WHOSE NAME WAS THESEUS THESEUS'S FATHER WAS AN UNKNOWN KING HE HAD BIDDEN THE MOTHER SHOW THEIR SON WHERE HIS SWORD WAS HIDDEN UNDER A GREAT STONE THE KING HAD HIDDEN IT BEFORE THESEUS WAS BORN
HERACLES STAYED TO FEAST ANOTHER DAY AND THEN WITH THE LION'S SKIN ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS AND THE GREAT CLUB IN HIS HANDS HE STARTED OFF BUT THIS TIME HE DID NOT GO ALONE THE BOY IOLAUS WENT WITH HIM
AND FOR ARMS HE CARRIED A MIGHTY BOW WITH BRONZE TIPPED ARROWS THE FOLK WERE WATCHING AN EAGLE AS HE CAME INTO THE CITY AN EAGLE THAT WAS WINGING ITS WAY FAR FAR UP IN THE SKY ARCAS DREW HIS BOW AND WITH ONE ARROW HE BROUGHT THE EAGLE DOWN
AND THE SWEET TASTE OF THE FRUITS THAT EPIMETHEUS BROUGHT TO HER COULD HAVE STAYED FOREVER IN THAT GARDEN BUT EVERY DAY EPIMETHEUS WOULD THINK THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE WORLD
AND IN A DAY ALL THE UNCLEANNESS WAS WASHED AWAY THEN HERACLES TURNED THE RIVERS BACK INTO THEIR OWN COURSES HE WAS NOT GIVEN THE REWARD HE HAD BARGAINED FOR HOWEVER
AS A QUEEN MIGHT SPEAK IN THE HALL THAT NIGHT
HER HUSBAND HAD SUDDENLY BECOME HARD TO HER AND HAD SHUT THE DOOR ON HER FACE THEY CAME UPON A CHILD CRYING BECAUSE OF A PAIN THAT HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND AND THEN THEY FOUND TWO MEN STRUGGLING THEIR STRIFE BEING ON ACCOUNT OF A POSSESSION
O TELL US YOU WHO ARE WISE HOW CAN WE MAKE OURSELVES AS BEAUTIFUL AS PANDORA THEN SAID THAT WOMAN WHO WAS THOUGHT TO BE WISE
AND HOW BY THE FLIGHT OF A PIGEON YOU WILL KNOW WHETHER OR NOT YOU MAY GO THAT WAY O JASON
BUT MEDEA DID NOT HAVE TO PULL BACK THE BOLTS AS SHE CHANTED HER MAGIC SONG THE BOLTS SOFTLY DREW BACK THE DOORS SOFTLY OPENED SWIFTLY SHE WENT ALONG THE WAYS THAT LED TO THE RIVER
AND HE SAID O EPIMETHEUS FATHER ZEUS WOULD BE RECONCILED WITH THEE AND AS A SIGN OF HIS GOOD WILL HE SENDS THEE THIS LOVELY GODDESS TO BE THY COMPANION
SO THE KING SPOKE AND THE COLCHIANS HATING ALL STRANGERS SHOUTED AROUND HIM WORD OF WHAT HER FATHER HAD SAID WAS BROUGHT TO MEDEA SHE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE ARGONAUTS AND BID THEM FLEE HASTILY FROM AEA
HERACLES AND IOLAUS WENT ON UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE VAST SWAMP OF LERNA RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SWAMP WAS THE WATER SNAKE THAT WAS CALLED THE HYDRA NINE HEADS IT HAD
AND THE MAIDENS KNEW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE CRY OF THE SHIP THAT MIGHT NOT BE GAINSAID AND THEY PUT THEIR HANDS BEFORE THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID NO OTHER WORD
I TOO AM A RULER JASON AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE GREAT COMMANDS THAT WE HAVE TO OBEY GO THEN TO THE ARGO AH NEITHER I NOR THE WOMEN OF LEMNOS WILL STAY YOUR GOING NOW
BUT WHO ARE EVER READY TO BE UP AND AWAY WITH THEIR HOUNDS BEFORE THE BEAMS OF THE SUN EFFACE THE TRACK AND THE SCENT OF THE QUARRY ALONG A PATH THAT WENT FROM THE RIVER MEDEA DREW JASON THEY ENTERED A GROVE
AND HE KNEW ALL THE WAYS OF THE GODS AND ALL THE STORIES OF THE GODS WHEN HE SANG TO HIS LYRE THE TREES WOULD LISTEN AND THE BEASTS WOULD FOLLOW HIM
SEATED HERSELF NOT ON THE COUCH WHERE SHE WAS WONT TO SIT LOOKING INTO THE FACE OF JASON BUT ON THE STONE THRONE OF KING THOAS HER FATHER AND SEATED ON THAT THRONE SHE SPOKE TO JASON AND TO HERACLES
AS YET THE FURROWS WERE FREE OF THE EARTH BORN MEN JASON WENT DOWN TO THE RIVER AND FILLED HIS HELMET FULL OF WATER AND DRANK DEEPLY AND HIS KNEES THAT WERE STIFFENED WITH THE PLOWING HE BENT UNTIL THEY WERE MADE SUPPLE AGAIN
THE OTHER WAS A MAIDEN EPIMETHEUS MARVELED AT THE CROWN UPON HER HEAD AND AT HER LOVELY GARMENTS THERE WAS A GLINT OF GOLD ALL AROUND HER HE ROSE FROM WHERE HE SAT UPON THE BROKEN PILLAR
BUT A GOLDEN MAID FOR EACH OUT OF THE JAR THAT HAS BEEN WITH HER YE HAVE TAKEN FORGETFULNESS OF YOUR HONOR AS FOR ME I GO BACK TO THE ARGO
THE HARD GROUND WAS TORN UP BY THE PLOW OF ADAMANT AND THE CLODS GROANED AS THEY WERE CAST UP JASON FLUNG THE TEETH BETWEEN THE OPEN SODS OFTEN TURNING HIS HEAD IN FEAR THAT THE DEADLY CROP OF THE EARTH BORN MEN WERE RISING BEHIND HIM
SHE SAT ON THE THRONE OF KING THOAS AND SHE HAD POLYXO HER NURSE TELL HER OF THE WAYS OF JASON'S VOYAGE AS HE HAD TOLD OF THEM AND OF ALL THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO PASS THROUGH WHEN THE OTHER LEMNIAN WOMEN SLEPT
TALL AS A MAN WALKING WITH STILTS THEY WELCOMED HIM AND BROUGHT HIM AND THE GOLDEN MAID TO THEIR HEARTHS AND EPIMETHEUS SHOWED PANDORA THE WONDERFUL ELEMENT THAT HIS BROTHER HAD GIVEN TO MEN AND SHE REJOICED TO SEE THE FIRE
BUT THEN HE REMEMBERED THAT THE CRIME THAT HE HAD COMMITTED IN HIS MADNESS WOULD HAVE TO BE EXPIATED BY LABORS PERFORMED AT THE ORDER OF THIS MAN HE LOOKED FULL UPON EURYSTHEUS AND HE SAID TELL ME OF THE OTHER LABORS
AND THE FURROWS RAN WITH THEIR DARK BLOOD AS CHANNELS RUN WITH WATER IN SPRINGTIME THE ARGONAUTS SHOUTED LOUDLY FOR JASON'S VICTORY
HE SAW A FIGURE STANDING BY THE MAST FOR A MOMENT HE LOOKED ON IT AND THEN THE FIGURE BECAME SHADOWY
HE SLEW SOME THAT HAD RISEN OUT OF THE EARTH ONLY AS FAR AS THE SHOULDERS HE SLEW OTHERS WHOSE FEET WERE STILL IN THE EARTH HE SLEW OTHERS WHO WERE READY TO SPRING UPON HIM SOON ALL THE EARTH BORN MEN WERE SLAIN
THE DEPARTURE FROM LEMNOS A DAY CAME
THEN JASON SAW SOMETHING THAT WAS LIKE A CLOUD FILLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE RISING SUN IT HUNG FROM A GREAT OAK TREE
ALL WAS READY FOR THE VOYAGE AND NOW JASON WENT WITH HIS FRIENDS TO VIEW THE SHIP BEFORE SHE WAS BROUGHT INTO THE WATER ARGUS THE MASTER WAS ON THE SHIP SEEING TO IT THAT THE LAST THINGS WERE BEING DONE BEFORE ARGO WAS LAUNCHED
WITH HIS LONG SPEAR HE DROVE THE BULLS BEFORE HIM AS WITH A GOAD TERRIBLY THEY RAGED FURIOUSLY THEY BREATHED OUT FIRE BESIDE JASON THESEUS WENT HOLDING THE HELMET THAT HELD THE DRAGON'S TEETH
HE WENT ON UNTIL HE CAME INTO A COUNTRY WHERE THE FENCES WERE OVERTHROWN AND THE FIELDS WASTED AND THE HOUSES EMPTY AND FALLEN HE WENT ON UNTIL HE CAME TO THE WASTE AROUND THAT LAND
AND AS SHE CAME NEARER THE CHARM THAT WAS ON HER LIPS AND IN HER EYES CAME TO THE EARTH BORN ONE AND HE SMILED WITH MORE AND MORE DELIGHT HERMES CAME AND STOOD BEFORE HIM HE ALSO SMILED
THEN HE DREW HIS SWORD AND CUT THE HAWSERS OF THE SHIP CALLING UPON THE HEROES TO DRIVE THE ARGO ON THERE WAS A DIN AND A STRAIN AND A SPLASH OF OARS AND AWAY FROM AEA THE ARGO DASHED
HERACLES DIPPED HIS ARROWS INTO THE GALL OF THE MONSTER MAKING HIS ARROWS DEADLY NO THING THAT WAS STRUCK BY THESE ARROWS AFTERWARD COULD KEEP ITS LIFE AGAIN HE CAME TO EURYSTHEUS'S PALACE
AND I WILL GO FORTH FROM MYCENAE AND ACCOMPLISH THEM THEN EURYSTHEUS BADE HIM GO AND MAKE CLEAN THE STABLES OF KING AUGEIAS HERACLES CAME INTO THAT KING'S COUNTRY
WHEN POLYDEUCES HAD ENDED THE STORY THAT CASTOR HAD BEGUN HERACLES CRIED OUT FOR THE ARGONAUTS TOO THERE HAS BEEN A GOLDEN MAID NAY NOT ONE
AND SET A GOLDEN CROWN UPON HER HEAD THE HOURS BROUGHT HER A GIRDLE OF SPRING FLOWERS THEN THE HERALD OF THE GODS GAVE HER SPEECH THAT WAS SWEET AND FLOWING ALL THE GODS AND GODDESSES HAD GIVEN GIFTS TO HER
AND HE LOST ONE POST AFTER ANOTHER TILL AT LAST ALL HE COULD DO
HE OFFERED PAUL ONE PAUL WAS NOT FOND OF BOULDERS BUT HE TOOK A WOODEN KNIFE AND CUT ONE IN TWO THEN HE SNATCHED UP BOTH HALVES IN HIS HANDS AND THREW THEM WITH ALL HIS STRENGTH AT THE DRAGON SO THAT TWO OUT OF THE SIX HEADS WERE SMASHED IN
AND THE FLAX WOUND ITSELF OFF AND HOWEVER MUCH SHE MIGHT USE THERE WAS ALWAYS PLENTY LEFT WHEN THE QUEEN OR RATHER THE SWINEHERD'S DAUGHTER HEARD OF THIS
AND THEY WENT TOGETHER TO THE SPOT
THE CROWS HAD HARDLY DONE SPEAKING WHEN AWAY THEY FLEW
ANYTHING OF WHAT YOU ASK
AND THEN DART OFF TOWARDS THE SUN SETTING WHEN YOU SEE HER DO THIS TAKE A SCARLET CLOAK OR IF THAT BE LACKING TO YOU BUY A FEW YARDS OF SCARLET CLOTH AND HURRY BACK TO THE TREE BEFORE THE WOODPECKER RETURNS WITH THE SPRING ROOT IN HER BEAK
AND ASKED TO HAVE SOME OF THE STEW BE OFF CRIED PAUL SNATCHING UP THE SAUCEPAN AS HE SPOKE THE DWARF TRIED TO GET HOLD OF HIS COLLAR
I AM LOOKING FOR LUCKY LUCK REPLIED THE PRINCE THEN YOU HAVE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE MY SON FOR I AM HIS MOTHER HE IS NOT AT HOME JUST NOW HE IS OUT DIGGING IN THE VINEYARD
HE CRIED WITH A LAUGH AH FOX
SAID TO THE REST WHAT SHALL WE EAT NOW MY FRIENDS AS THERE IS NO MORE MAN I SUPPOSE WE SHALL HAVE TO EAT THE SMALLEST OF US REPLIED THE BEAR
PETER THEN TOLD HER THE WHOLE STORY AND OF HIS STRIKING THE FLAMES WITH THE THREE NAPKINS AS HE HAD BEEN TOLD TO DO THE MAIDEN LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND WONDERED IN HERSELF WHETHER WHAT HE SAID WAS TRUE SO AFTER PETER HAD GONE OUT TO THE FIELDS
AH I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN SAID THE DRAGON THOSE WERE MY TWO BROTHERS WHOM YOU KILLED AND NOW YOUR BLOOD SHALL PAY FOR THEM
STRUCK HIS HEAD AGAINST A STONE AND WAS KILLED NOT LONG AFTER THE MARTEN CAME BY ON THE LOOK OUT FOR HIS SUPPER SEEING THE DEAD MAN LYING THERE HE SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IS A PRIZE THIS TIME I HAVE DONE WELL
AND REMORSE CAUSED HER THE GLOOMIEST FOREBODINGS AH LUCIA SHE CRIED
THAT HIS SON STILL LIVED AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP THE CROWN TO HIM NOW HE WAS MARRIED FOR THAT WAS THE LAW OF THE LAND HE LONGED TO KNOW HOW THE PRINCE HAD ESCAPED AND SAID MY DEAR SON
ABOUT MIDNIGHT HE HEARD THREE CROWS WHO HAD FLOWN TO THE ROOF TALKING TOGETHER THAT'S A HANDSOME COUPLE WHICH ARRIVED HERE TONIGHT IT SEEMS QUITE A PITY THEY SHOULD LOSE THEIR LIVES SO SOON
AT LAST HOWEVER THE SHEEP SEEMED TIRED OF RUNNING ABOUT AND THEN THE YOUTH MANAGED TO GATHER THEM TOGETHER AND DROVE THEM AS BEFORE STRAIGHT TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE WHOSE SHEEP ARE THESE AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE ASKED THE OLD MAN IN WONDER AND HIS SON TOLD HIM BUT WHEN THE TALE WAS ENDED THE FATHER SHOOK HIS HEAD
ANSWERED THE FOX IN AN ABSENT VOICE AS IF HE WAS NOT THINKING OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING OH MY BROTHER MY DEAR LITTLE BROTHER DON'T DO THAT CRIED THE MAGPIE HOPPING ABOUT IN HIS ANGUISH
BUT THE CAPTAIN LAY SO STIFF AND STARK THAT AT LAST HE WAS TAKEN IN THE PRINCE NEXT DRAGGED THE HEADLESS BODIES INTO A CHAMBER IN THE CAVE AND LOCKED THE DOOR THEN HE AND HIS MOTHER RANSACKED THE PLACE FOR SOME FOOD
AND THEY FARED NO BETTER THAN TREE COMBER HAD DONE THE FOURTH DAY PAUL SAID TO THEM MY FRIENDS THERE MUST BE SOME REASON WHY YOUR COOKING HAS ALWAYS BEEN SO BAD NOW YOU SHALL GO AND HUNT AND I WILL STAY BEHIND
AND THE PRINCE WAS GLAD TO MAKE PEACE FOR HE HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE GIANT'S BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER AND FROM THAT DAY HE OFTEN SOUGHT THE GIANT'S HOUSE
SCARCELY HAD HE PUT IT ON WHEN THE DRAGON CAME BACK AND THE FIGHT BEGAN LONG AND HARD WAS THE STRUGGLE BUT PAUL'S SWORD AND HIS SHIRT HELPED HIM AND THE TWELVE HEADS LAY DEAD UPON THE GROUND
THE QUEEN REPENTED BITTERLY HER PROMISE TO THE GIRL BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO RECALL IT FOR ILONKA HAD ALREADY ENTERED THE KING'S ROOM WHERE HE LAY ANXIOUSLY WAITING FOR SOMETHING
THE PRINCE BADE HIM FAREWELL AND SET OUT HE WANDERED SO FAR THAT HE CROSSED SEVEN KINGDOMS AND AT LAST ONE EVENING HE CAME TO A LITTLE HOUSE IN WHICH WAS AN OLD WOMAN
ALMOST RIGHT THROUGH IT WITHOUT FINDING A HOUSE WHERE HE COULD TURN IN
THE WOLF AND THE BEAR AGREED AND THEY TURNED OUT OF THE HOLLOW WHERE THEY HAD BEEN WALKING AND CHOSE A PATH THAT LED UP THE MOUNTAIN SIDE THE FOX TROTTED CHEERFULLY BY HIS TWO BIG COMPANIONS BUT ON THE WAY HE MANAGED TO WHISPER TO THE WOLF TELL ME PETER
ONLY SEE THAT SHE COMES NEITHER FROM A SMALL TOWN NOR A REMOTE ISLAND SO AN EMBASSY WAS PREPARED WITH THE MINISTER AT ITS HEAD TO VISIT THE GREATEST COURTS IN THE WORLD
DO GIVE ME A GLASS OF WATER BUT HOW COULD THE PRINCE GIVE IT HER WHEN THERE WAS NO WATER AT HAND SO THE LOVELY MAIDEN FLEW AWAY HE SPLIT THE SECOND BULRUSH AS AN EXPERIMENT AND JUST THE SAME THING HAPPENED
HE ATE UP THE CONTENTS OF THE SAUCEPAN AND VANISHED TREE COMBER FELT RATHER ASHAMED OF HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT BOILING SOME MORE VEGETABLES BUT THEY WERE STILL VERY HARD WHEN THE HUNTERS RETURNED
ROLLED INTO A CORNER THEN THE YOUNG MAN CRIED INSTEAD HOP I AM HERE THE SECOND MAN HEARING THE SIGNAL LEAPT THE DITCH IN CONFIDENCE AND WAS MET BY THE SAME FATE
AND YOU MAY HELP YOURSELF TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT IF YOU TAKE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN CARRY YOU WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT TO LAST YOUR LIFETIME AND YOU MAY RETURN THREE TIMES BUT WOE BETIDE YOU IF YOU VENTURE TO COME A FOURTH TIME
OF COURSE SHE WAS VERY BUSY ALL DAY LONG BUT WHENEVER SHE HAD A LITTLE SPARE TIME SHE SAT DOWN TO SPIN HER DISTAFF TURNED OF ITSELF AND HER SPINDLE SPAN BY ITSELF
THEY LAUGHED IN HIS FACE AND RAN AWAY THIS WENT ON FOR SOME TIME BUT AT LAST ONE OF THE BOYS SPIED OUT A WOODPECKER IN THE MEADOW LANDS AMONG THE WOOD PIGEONS AND WHEN HE HAD FOUND HER NEST IN A HALF DEAD ALDER TREE CAME RUNNING TO PETER WITH THE NEWS OF HIS DISCOVERY
AND THAT THE MINISTER WOULD SOON REPENT HIS CHOICE BUT THIS ONLY MADE HIM THE MORE EAGER AND IN THE END HE GAINED HER CONSENT AND PREVAILED ON HER TO RETURN WITH HIM AT ONCE TO HIS OWN COUNTRY THE MINISTER THEN CONDUCTED THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER BACK TO THE SHIP THE ANCHOR WAS RAISED THE SAILS SPREAD
BUT IT WAS ONLY BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD THE THREE GIRLS SO PAUL SENT THEM UP AND TOLD THEM TO BE SURE AND LET DOWN THE BASKET FOR HIM UNLUCKILY AT THE SIGHT OF THE MAIDENS BEAUTY
THAT THEY HAD NOBODY TO RIGHT THEIR WRONGS YOU MUST ROUSE YOURSELF SIR WENT ON THE MINISTER AND PUT ASIDE YOUR OWN SORROWS FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR COUNTRY YOU DO NOT SPARE ME ANSWERED THE KING BUT WHAT YOU SAY IS JUST AND YOUR COUNSEL IS GOOD
HE WOULD HAVE LET HER OFF THE OTHER TWO
STILL THE SOUND OF SHEEP BELLS RANG SOFTLY FROM ABOVE AND THE HERDSMAN KNEW THEM TO BE THOSE HE HAD HUNG ON THE HORNS OF HIS RAM DO YOU HEAR ASKED THE YOUTH YES I HEAR
ONE DAY THE OLD WOMAN HAD GONE TO THE TOWN TO BUY SOME FLOUR AND PETER AND THE MAIDEN WERE LEFT ALONE IN THE HOUSE THEY FELL INTO TALK AND SHE ASKED HIM WHERE HIS HOME WAS AND HOW HE HAD MANAGED TO COME THROUGH THE FIRE
IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND I I RAN AFTER THEM AND NEARLY DIED OF FATIGUE THEN I HEARD A A NOISE WHICH I I THOUGHT WAS THE WIND BUT BUT IT WAS THE SHEEP WHICH BE BEFORE MY VERY EYES WERE CARRIED STRAIGHT UP UP INTO THE AIR I STOOD WATCHING THEM AS IF I WAS TURNED TO STONE
AND PERHAPS LINEIK WHO HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE PAST EITHER MIGHT HAVE LEFT HER ALONE
SOBBED THE WIFE THEN SUBIDA TOOK UP A PURSE CONTAINING TWO HUNDRED GOLD PIECES AND SAID YOUR HUSBAND SERVED US LONG AND FAITHFULLY YOU MUST SEE THAT HE HAS A FINE FUNERAL
AND YOU DO WELL FOR HE DESERVES EVERYTHING GO BACK AND WHEN YOU GET HOME YOUR WIFE WILL JUST HAVE HAD A LITTLE BOY TAKE THREE DROPS OF BLOOD FROM THE CHILD'S LITTLE FINGER
THROW ME FIRST OVER THIS PRECIPICE SO THAT MY FEATHERS MAY BE STREWN HERE AND THERE AND THAT ALL WHO SEE THEM MAY KNOW THAT YOUR CUNNING IS GREATER THAN MINE
WITH A POINTED BEARD THE MOMENT THAT PAUL KNEW THAT THIS TERRIBLE DRAGON WAS NO OTHER THAN THE DWARF WHOM HE HAD TIED TO THE TREE HE LONGED MORE THAN EVER TO FLY AT HIS THROAT BUT THE THOUGHT OF THE EIGHTEEN HEADS
FOR A LONG WHILE HE TRAVELLED ON AND ON AND NOBODY SEEMED TO WANT HIM BUT ONE DAY HE MET AN OLD MAN AND BEING A POLITE YOUTH HE TOOK OFF HIS HAT AND SAID GOOD MORNING IN A PLEASANT VOICE
TO HER HE CONFIDED ALL HIS PLANS AND LEFT HIS WIFE THE PRINCESS IN HER CARE
FOR SHE HAD SOME ILL WORD FOR EVERYONE THEREFORE WHEN MASTER PETER CAME ALONG AND LET HIMSELF BE TAKEN IN BY HER BOASTED SKILL AS A HOUSEWIFE SHE JUMPED AT HIS OFFER AND THEY WERE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY BUT THEY HAD NOT GOT HOME BEFORE THEY BEGAN TO QUARREL
AND THE PRINCE WHO SOON HEARD ABOUT HER BEAUTY COULD NOT REST TILL HE SAW HER HE WAS VERY KINDLY RECEIVED FOR HE WAS EXTREMELY GOOD LOOKING AND HAD CHARMING MANNERS
THE GIANT BADE HIM GIVE THE SWORD TO THE PRINCE WHO GIRDED HIMSELF WITH IT AND RETURNED WITH ALL SPEED TO THE CASTLE COME OUT YOU RASCAL COME OUT YOU VILLAIN
AND WHEN THEY HAD EATEN IT THEY LAY DOWN AND SLEPT IN PEACE WITH THE DAWN THEY WERE BOTH AWAKE AGAIN AND FOUND THAT INSTEAD OF THE CAVE WHICH THEY HAD COME TO THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY NOW WERE IN A SPLENDID CASTLE FULL OF BEAUTIFUL ROOMS
SHE BADE HIM WELCOME TO HER PALACE AND WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED SUPPER SHE TOLD HIM OF THE LOSS OF HER HUSBAND AND HOW THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT TO GOVERN THE KINGDOM BUT HERSELF BUT WHERE IS THE PRINCESS LINEIK ASKED THE PRINCE WHEN SHE HAD ENDED HER TALE
THROUGH FORESTS STILL THICKER AND RIVERS STILL WIDER AND MOUNTAINS STILL MORE SLIPPERY THAN THE OTHERS HE HAD PASSED TILL AT LENGTH HE REACHED A HOUSE WHERE DWELT ANOTHER OLD WOMAN GOOD DAY MOTHER SAID HE GOOD DAY MY SON
AND EVERY BEAM BUT LUCKILY MASTER PETER WAS NOT HANGING FROM ANY OF THEM AFTER THAT THE NEIGHBOURS WENT OUT WITH LONG POLES TO FISH IN EVERY DITCH AND POND BUT THEY FOUND NOTHING
SHE WAS OVERJOYED AT THE SIGHT OF HER SISTER AND OF PAUL AND BROUGHT HIM A SHIRT BELONGING TO THE DRAGON
THEN HE SAID CALMLY DO NOT BE ANNOYED DEAR WIFE I HAVE A GOOD PIECE OF BUSINESS IN HAND WHICH MAY TURN OUT WELL FOR US YOU WITH A GOOD BUSINESS
WHICH WAS LOWERED BY HIS FRIENDS AT LAST IT TOUCHED THE GROUND AND HE JUMPED OUT AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM HE WAS IN A BEAUTIFUL VALLEY FULL OF MEADOWS AND STREAMS WITH A SPLENDID CASTLE STANDING BY AS THE DOOR WAS OPEN HE WALKED IN
SAID HE POLITELY GOOD EVENING TO YOU MY DEAR SON ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN IT IS LUCKY FOR YOU THAT YOU SPOKE TO ME OR YOU WOULD HAVE MET WITH A HORRIBLE DEATH
THIS GRIEVED THE TENDER HEART OF HIS PRETTY DAUGHTER WHO LOVED HIM DEARLY AND WAS THE COMFORT OF HIS LIFE PETER WAS THINKING OF HER AS HE SAT IN THE INN KITCHEN AND HEARD THE SHEPHERDS TALKING ABOUT THE BURIED TREASURE
AND HE WENT UP TO THE BED AND FOUND THE CORPSES STIFF AND MOTIONLESS I WOULD GIVE A THOUSAND GOLD PIECES TO ANYONE WHO WOULD TELL ME THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS CRIED HE
BUT TO DAY I HAVE SOMETHING QUITE EASY FOR YOU TO DO YOU MUST LOOK AFTER FORTY OXEN AND BE SURE YOU ARE VERY CAREFUL FOR ONE OF THEM HAS GOLD TIPPED HORNS AND HOOFS AND THE KING RECKONS IT AMONG HIS GREATEST TREASURES THE YOUNG MAN DROVE OUT THE OXEN INTO THE MEADOW
NEVER MIND MY FRIEND SAID THE GIANT I WILL GET IT BACK FOR YOU AND HE SENT FOR THE MONKEY WHO WAS HIS HEAD SERVANT TELL THE FOX AND THE SQUIRREL THAT THEY ARE TO GO WITH YOU AND FETCH ME BACK THE PRINCE'S SWORD
IRON STRONG WORLD'S WEIGHT QUICK EAR FLY TO MY HELP OR I AM A DEAD MAN AND IRON STRONG HEARD AND SAID YES HE IS CERTAINLY CALLING WE MUST GO AT ONCE
WHEN I AM EATEN WHAT WILL YOU HAVE FOR YOUR NEXT DINNER THIS SIMPLE QUESTION SEEMED TO PUT OUT THE WOLF VERY MUCH WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE FOR THEIR NEXT DINNER AND WHAT WAS MORE IMPORTANT STILL
HE ONLY SAYS THAT TO PLEASE YOU CRIED SUBIDA IN A RAGE AND CALLING TO HER CHAMBERLAIN SHE ORDERED HIM TO GO AT ONCE TO THE DWELLING OF ABU NOWAS AND SEE WHICH OF THE TWO WAS DEAD AND BE SURE YOU TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT IT ADDED SHE
WHO SAID THAT THE KING HAD SENT TWO SPLENDID ROBES FOR THE PRINCE AND HIS BRIDE AND BEGGED THAT THEY WOULD WEAR THEM FOR THEIR STATE ENTRY BUT THE SERVANT IMPLORED THE PRINCE TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM
HE SAID YES BEAUTIFULLY JUST LISTEN AND THE FOX LIFTED UP HIS VOICE AND SANG WEEPING LOU LOU LOU THE FAMOUS SPINNER THE BAKER OF GOOD CAKES THE PRUDENT HOUSEKEEPER IS TORN FROM HER HUSBAND
AND THAT I HAVE NO MONEY FOR HER BURIAL
I DO NOT DESIRE YOUR TREASURES AT THIS THE SPECTRE GRINNED IN MY FACE AND CRIED MOCKINGLY SIMPLETON DO YOU SCORN YOUR GOOD FORTUNE WELL THEN REMAIN A RAGAMUFFIN ALL YOUR DAYS HE TURNED AS IF TO GO AWAY FROM ME
AND YOU NEED NOT BE ANXIOUS ABOUT GOING SHE ADDED FOR I WILL RULE THE COUNTRY WHILE YOU ARE AWAY AS CAREFULLY AS YOU COULD YOURSELF THE KING HAD NO GREAT DESIRE TO UNDERTAKE THIS JOURNEY BUT THE QUEEN'S WILL WAS STRONGER THAN HIS
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE MY SON ASKED THE OLD WOMAN I AM SEEKING FOR A PLACE MOTHER ANSWERED PETER STAY WITH ME THEN FOR I NEED A SERVANT SAID THE OLD WOMAN WITH PLEASURE MOTHER REPLIED HE AFTER THAT
HE COULD NOT HAVE CUT DOWN THE TREE FOR HE HAS NEITHER AXE NOR KNIFE DEAR ME TO THINK THAT YOU HAVE SACRIFICED YOUR YOUNG ONES FOR NOTHING
BUT HE CUT OFF THE HEAD OF THE RAM WHICH ALWAYS LED THE FLOCK AND HAD BELLS ROUND ITS HORNS THIS HE TOOK BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN FEEDING FOR HERE HE HAD NOTICED A HIGH ROCK WITH A PATCH OF GREEN GRASS IN THE MIDDLE AND TWO OR THREE THICK BUSHES GROWING ON THE EDGE
TILL THEY REACHED THE GROVE WITH THE RED AND GREEN TREES INTO WHICH THEY JUMPED AND FELT THAT AT LAST THEY WERE SAFE NOW AT THAT TIME THERE REIGNED OVER GREECE A KING WHO WAS VERY RICH AND POWERFUL ALTHOUGH HIS NAME HAS SOMEHOW BEEN FORGOTTEN HE HAD TWO CHILDREN
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE SOON HE HEARD HIS WIFE'S HARSH VOICE SINGING ITS MORNING SONG AS SHE WENT ABOUT HER HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS SCOLDING HER DAUGHTER THE WHILE SHE BURST OPEN HIS DOOR WHILE HE WAS STILL DRESSING WELL TOPER WAS HER GREETING
HAD NO DESIRE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION HE LEFT THE FOREST BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE HIGH ROAD HE LAID HIMSELF AT FULL LENGTH ON THE GROUND STRETCHING HIMSELF OUT JUST AS IF HE WAS DEAD VERY SOON HE NOTICED
WHEN THEY HAD FINISHED THE QUEEN SAID MY SON I AM THIRSTY FETCH ME SOME WATER THE PRINCE GOT UP AT ONCE AND WENT TO A BROOK WHICH HE HEARD GURGLING NEAR AT HAND HE STOOPED AND FILLED HIS HAT WITH THE WATER WHICH HE BROUGHT TO HIS MOTHER
AND EVERYTHING FELL OUT EXACTLY AS BLAIZE HAD FORETOLD AS SOON AS THE WOODPECKER CAME BACK WITH THE ROOT IN HER BEAK OUT RUSHED MASTER PETER FROM BEHIND THE TREE AND DISPLAYED THE FIERY RED CLOAK SO ADROITLY THAT THE TERRIFIED BIRD DROPPED THE ROOT JUST WHERE IT COULD BE EASILY SEEN
YOU ARE GREAT USELESS CREATURES SAID HE WHO COULDN'T EVEN OUTWIT THAT LITTLE DWARF WHEN WE HAVE FINISHED SUPPER I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT I HAVE DONE WITH HIM BUT WHEN THEY REACHED THE PLACE WHERE PAUL HAD LEFT THE DWARF
IN A TINY COTTAGE NEAR THE KING'S PALACE THERE ONCE LIVED AN OLD MAN HIS WIFE AND HIS SON A VERY LAZY FELLOW WHO WOULD NEVER DO A STROKE OF WORK HE COULD NOT BE GOT EVEN TO LOOK AFTER THEIR ONE COW
IT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WORK I HAVE EVER SEEN SAID HE TAKING UP A BIT AND I AM SURE THAT THE RED ONE WILL BE STILL BETTER BECAUSE THE STUFF IS RICHER AND WITH A LOW BOW HE LEFT THE ROOM LAUFER HAD HOPED SECRETLY THAT WHEN THE PRINCE HAD SEEN THE BLUE DRESS FINISHED
TILL IT REACHED THE ROCK UP WHICH HE HAD CLIMBED AND DASHED SO FAR UP IT THAT THE SPRAY FLEW OVER HIM BUT HE CLUNG ON TIGHT AND AFTER FAILING TO REACH HIM THREE TIMES
WHEN YOU FIND THIS HOLLOW DIG IT OUT BUT IT WILL BE HARD WORK FOR THE EARTH HAS BEEN PRESSED DOWN INTO IT WITH CARE STILL WORK AWAY TILL YOU FIND SOLID ROCK ON ALL SIDES OF YOU AND SOON YOU WILL COME TO A SQUARE SLAB OF STONE
YES I FEEL THE DITCH BEFORE THE ENTRANCE SOMEONE FORGOT TO PILE UP THE FIRE BEFORE WE LEFT AND IT HAS BURNT ITSELF OUT BUT IT IS ALL RIGHT LET EVERY MAN JUMP ACROSS AND AS HE DOES SO CRY OUT HOP I AM HERE
MIXING GOLD THREAD AND PRECIOUS STONES TILL YOU COULD HARDLY SEE THE RED OF THE STUFF WHEN IT WAS DONE SHE
THEY HAD A QUICK VOYAGE AND IN SIX DAYS THEY REACHED THE LAND AND AT ONCE SET OUT FOR THE CAPITAL A MESSENGER BEING SENT ON FIRST BY THE MINISTER TO INFORM THE KING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN HIS MAJESTY'S EYES FELL ON THE TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN CLAD IN DRESSES OF GOLD AND SILVER
AND IN SPITE OF ALL HIS EFFORTS HE FELT HE COULD NOT KEEP AWAKE MUCH LONGER WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF THE ROBBERS RETURNING SHOUTING AND SINGING AS THEY MARCHED ALONG SOON THE SINGING CEASED
IN THE JOY OF HIS HEART PETER HAD TASTED FREELY OF HIS OWN GOOD WINE AND AS THE BRIDE HUNG UPON HIS ARM HE STUMBLED AND FELL DRAGGING HER DOWN WITH HIM WHEREUPON SHE BEAT HIM SOUNDLY AND THE NEIGHBOURS SAID TRULY THAT THINGS DID NOT PROMISE WELL FOR MASTER PETER'S COMFORT
AND MORE HORRIBLE THAN THIS ONE HE VOWED THAT HIS SWORD SHOULD NEVER REST IN ITS SHEATH TILL THEY WERE SET FREE AND BADE THE GIRL COME WITH HIM AND SHOW HIM THE WAY
BUT ONE OF THE PECULIARITIES OF JAMES'S CHARACTER WAS THAT NO ACT HOWEVER WICKED AND SHAMEFUL WHICH HAD BEEN PROMPTED BY A DESIRE TO GAIN HIS FAVOUR EVER SEEMED TO HIM DESERVING OF DISAPPROBATION
BUT WAS HONOURED WITH A FRIENDLY LETTER IN THE HANDWRITING OF LEWIS MARY WAS ON THE ROAD TOWARDS THE FRENCH COURT WHEN NEWS CAME THAT HER HUSBAND HAD AFTER A ROUGH VOYAGE LANDED SAFE AT THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF AMBLETEUSE
A PLEA WAS WANTED WHICH MIGHT JUSTIFY THE DUKE OF YORK IN BREAKING THAT PROMISE OF MARRIAGE BY WHICH HE HAD OBTAINED FROM ANNE HYDE THE LAST PROOF OF FEMALE AFFECTION SUCH A PLEA TALBOT IN CONCERT WITH SOME OF HIS DISSOLUTE COMPANIONS
BY PREMATURELY ATTEMPTING TO FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE PRIVY COUNCIL AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS MIGHT LOSE THEIR MANSIONS AND THEIR AMPLE ESTATES AND MIGHT END THEIR LIVES AS TRAITORS ON TOWER HILL OR AS BEGGARS
WAS NOT A FANATICAL PRESBYTERIAN BUT HE WAS AT BEST A LATITUDINARIAN HE HAD NO SCRUPLE ABOUT COMMUNICATING IN THE ANGLICAN FORM BUT HE CARED NOT IN WHAT FORM OTHER PEOPLE COMMUNICATED HIS WIFE IT WAS TO BE FEARED HAD IMBIBED TOO MUCH OF HIS SPIRIT
SHE BROKE FORTH INTO PASSIONATE EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE MADAM SAID HER HOST IT IS BUT A MELANCHOLY SERVICE THAT I AM RENDERING YOU TO DAY I HOPE THAT I MAY BE ABLE HEREAFTER TO RENDER YOU SERVICES GREATER AND MORE PLEASING
TO THE ENEMIES OF JAMES IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE FIRST DECISIVE ASSURANCES OF SUNDERLAND'S SUPPORT WERE CONVEYED ORALLY BY SIDNEY TO WILLIAM ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST IT IS CERTAIN THAT FROM THAT TIME TILL THE EXPEDITION WAS READY TO SAIL
BUT HOSTILE TO HIM IN A PAPER WRITTEN WITH GREAT ACRIMONY HE COMPLAINED OF THE INJUSTICE WITH WHICH FRANCE WAS ON ALL OCCASIONS TREATED BY THAT SEE WHICH OUGHT TO EXTEND A PARENTAL PROTECTION
FROM THE DAY ON WHICH THE EXPEDITION SAILED THE ANXIETY OF THE WHOLE DUTCH NATION HAD BEEN INTENSE NEVER HAD THERE BEEN SUCH CROWDS IN THE CHURCHES NEVER HAD THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PREACHERS BEEN SO ARDENT
AND WHILE WAGGING THEIR TAILS AND LICKING THEIR JAWS HELD A LONG DIALOGUE TOUCHING THE REAL PRESENCE THE AUTHORITY OF POPES AND COUNCILS THE PENAL LAWS THE TEST ACT OATES'S PERJURIES BUTLER'S UNREQUITED SERVICES TO THE CAVALIER PARTY
WERE NOW AS ANXIOUS TO SUPPORT ROCHESTER AS THEY HAD FORMERLY BEEN TO SUPPORT HALIFAX ALL THE INFLUENCE OF BARILLON WAS EMPLOYED ON THE OTHER SIDE AND BARILLON WAS ASSISTED BY ANOTHER FRENCH AGENT
THEY WERE PROBABLY EVEN NOW MEDITATING ANOTHER WESTERN INSURRECTION OR ANOTHER RYE HOUSE PLOT JAMES THEREFORE CONCEIVED THAT HE MIGHT SAFELY PERSECUTE THE CHURCH IF HE COULD ONLY GAIN THE DISSENTERS
IT WAS INDEED IN THE POWER OF THE KING BY THE EXERCISE OF HIS PREROGATIVE OF MERCY TO SUSPEND THE OPERATION OF THE PENAL LAWS IT MIGHT HEREAFTER BE IN HIS POWER BY DISCREET MANAGEMENT
A TITLE WHICH THE EVENTS OF THE PRECEDING CENTURY HAD MADE ONE OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS IN EUROPE FROM A CITY WHICH LIES ON THE BANKS OF THE RHONE NOT FAR FROM AVIGNON AND WHICH LIKE AVIGNON
WAS NOW PUNCTILIOUS INDEED BUT PUNCTILIOUS FOR HIS UNFORTUNATE FRIENDS AGAINST HIMSELF HE GAVE ORDERS THAT MARY SHOULD RECEIVE ALL THE MARKS OF RESPECT THAT HAD EVER BEEN PAID TO HIS OWN DECEASED WIFE
AND HAD OF HIS OWN ACCORD
SWORE AT THE COOKS AND POSTILIONS AND ALMOST RAISED MOBS BY HIS INSOLENT RODOMONTADES THE REFORMATION HE TOLD THE PEOPLE HAD RUINED EVERYTHING BUT FINE TIMES WERE COMING
AT LENGTH AFTER MANY EVENTFUL YEARS THE ASSOCIATES SO LONG PARTED WERE REUNITED IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY WHOEVER HAS READ THE TALE OF THE HIND AND PANTHER WITH ATTENTION
THE NAME OF A MORE ILLUSTRIOUS RENEGADE JOHN DRYDEN DRYDEN WAS NOW APPROACHING THE DECLINE OF LIFE AFTER MANY SUCCESSES AND MANY FAILURES HE HAD AT LENGTH ATTAINED BY GENERAL CONSENT
BUT THOSE LAWS SHOULD BE MITIGATED BY A LENIENT ADMINISTRATION NO CLASS WOULD REALLY GAIN MORE BY THE PROPOSED EXPEDITION THAN THOSE PEACEABLE AND UNAMBITIOUS ROMAN CATHOLICS WHO MERELY WISHED TO FOLLOW THEIR CALLINGS AND TO WORSHIP THEIR MAKER WITHOUT MOLESTATION
HE EMBRACED THE LITTLE PRINCE OF WALES AND MADE THE QUEEN SEAT HERSELF IN THE ROYAL STATE COACH ON THE RIGHT HAND THE CAVALCADE THEN TURNED TOWARDS SAINT GERMAINS
MUST BE FILLED WITH SHAME AND INDIGNATION BY LEARNING THAT HIS WHOLE LIFE HAD BEEN A LIE THAT WHILE HE PROFESSED TO BELONG TO THEIR COMMUNION HE HAD REALLY REGARDED THEM AS HERETICS
SHE VEHEMENTLY PROTESTED THAT IT WAS A FORGERY HER HUSBAND WITH CHARACTERISTIC INGENUITY DEFENDED HIMSELF BY REPRESENTING THAT IT WAS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY MAN TO BE SO BASE AS TO DO WHAT HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF DOING
OF THE RESIDENCES OF THE FRENCH KINGS NONE STOOD IN A MORE SALUBRIOUS AIR OR COMMANDED A FAIRER PROSPECT THE HUGE SIZE AND VENERABLE AGE OF THE TREES THE BEAUTY OF THE GARDENS THE ABUNDANCE OF THE SPRINGS WERE WIDELY FAMED
AND WHO HAD BEEN REWARDED FOR HIS SERVICES WITH THE TITLE
REPRESENTED FRANCE AND WHO TO VIRTUES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS EMINENTLY FRENCH JOINED IN LARGE MEASURE THAT UNQUIET UNSCRUPULOUS AND VAINGLORIOUS AMBITION WHICH HAS REPEATEDLY DRAWN ON FRANCE THE RESENTMENT OF EUROPE
THESE PREPARATIONS REQUIRED READY MONEY BUT WILLIAM HAD BY STRICT ECONOMY LAID UP AGAINST A GREAT EMERGENCY A TREASURE AMOUNTING TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING WHAT MORE WAS WANTING WAS SUPPLIED BY THE ZEAL OF HIS PARTISANS
THE GROWTH OF FIVE GENERATIONS DIFFUSED THROUGH ALL RANKS AND PARTIES AND INTERTWINED NOT LESS CLOSELY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE TORY THAN WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE WHIG
GREAT CROWDS ASSEMBLED AT FIRST BY NIGHT AND THEN BY BROAD DAYLIGHT POPES WERE PUBLICLY BURNED LOUD SHOUTS WERE RAISED FOR A FREE PARLIAMENT PLACARDS WERE STUCK UP SETTING PRICES ON THE HEADS OF THE MINISTERS OF THE CROWN
AROSE FROM THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BATAVIAN REPUBLIC NO GREAT SOCIETY HAS EVER EXISTED DURING A LONG COURSE OF YEARS UNDER A POLITY SO INCONVENIENT THE STATES GENERAL COULD NOT MAKE WAR OR PEACE
RULES WHICH THAT CHURCH IN COMMON WITH EVERY OTHER CHRISTIAN SOCIETY RECOGNISES AS BINDING THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MARKED DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIS EARLIER AND HIS LATER COMPOSITIONS
BUT DRAWN UP BY SOME PERSON MORE SKILLED THAN SIDNEY IN THE ART OF COMPOSITION WAS DESPATCHED TO THE HAGUE IN THIS PAPER WILLIAM WAS ASSURED THAT NINETEEN TWENTIETHS OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE WERE DESIROUS OF A CHANGE AND WOULD WILLINGLY JOIN TO EFFECT IT
THOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCOVER THE WHOLE TRUTH IT IS EASY TO DETECT SOME PALPABLE FICTIONS THE JACOBITES FOR OBVIOUS REASONS AFFIRMED THAT THE REVOLUTION OF SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WAS THE RESULT OF A PLOT CONCERTED LONG BEFORE
AT SAINT GERMAINS ON THE VERGE OF A FOREST SWARMING WITH BEASTS OF CHASE AND ON THE BROW OF A HILL WHICH LOOKS DOWN ON THE WINDINGS OF THE SEINE FRANCIS THE FIRST HAD BUILT A CASTLE AND HENRY THE FOURTH HAD CONSTRUCTED A NOBLE TERRACE
HAD BEGUN TO FEEL PAINFUL MISGIVINGS AND OCCASIONALLY VENTURED TO HINT A SMALL PART OF WHAT THEY FELT DURING MANY YEARS THE ZEAL OF THE ENGLISH TORY FOR HEREDITARY MONARCHY
IN SOME TOWN COUNCILS THE PARTY WHICH HAD DURING SEVERAL GENERATIONS REGARDED THE INFLUENCE OF THE STADTHOLDERS WITH JEALOUSY HAD GREAT POWER AT THE HEAD OF THIS PARTY WERE THE MAGISTRATES OF THE NOBLE CITY OF AMSTERDAM
BEEN NEGATIVED BY THE SINGLE VOICE OF AMSTERDAM THE ONLY CONSTITUTIONAL REMEDY IN SUCH CASES WAS THAT DEPUTIES FROM THE CITIES WHICH WERE AGREED SHOULD PAY A VISIT TO THE CITY WHICH DISSENTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPOSTULATION
AND INDEED ALL DIVINES AND PUBLICISTS AGREE IN THIS THAT WHEN THE DAUGHTER OF A PRINCE OF ONE COUNTRY IS MARRIED TO A PRINCE OF ANOTHER COUNTRY SHE IS BOUND TO FORGET HER OWN PEOPLE AND HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND
TWO PAPERS IN WHICH WERE SET FORTH VERY CONCISELY THE ARGUMENTS ORDINARILY USED BY ROMAN CATHOLICS IN CONTROVERSY WITH PROTESTANTS HAD BEEN FOUND IN CHARLES'S STRONG BOX
SUCH WAS THE REASONING OF THE PRIMATE HAD MADE JAMES AS UNFIT TO RULE HIS DOMINIONS AS ANY CHILD IN SWADDLING CLOTHES
AND TURNED AWAY TO ENCOUNTER MORE FORMIDABLE COMBATANTS DRYDEN THEN BETOOK HIMSELF TO A WEAPON AT WHICH HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO FIND HIS MATCH HE RETIRED FOR A TIME FROM THE BUSTLE OF COFFEEHOUSES AND THEATRES
THE NATION HAD NOT WAITED FOR THE CALL TOWN AND COUNTRY WERE ALREADY UP IN ARMS FOR THE PRINCE OF ORANGE NITHISDALE AND CLYDESDALE WERE THE ONLY REGIONS IN WHICH THERE WAS THE LEAST CHANCE THAT THE ROMAN CATHOLICS WOULD MAKE HEAD
SUNDERLAND THEY REPRESENTED AS THE CHIEF CONSPIRATOR HE HAD THEY AVERRED IN PURSUANCE OF HIS GREAT DESIGN INCITED HIS TOO CONFIDING MASTER TO DISPENSE WITH STATUTES TO CREATE AN ILLEGAL TRIBUNAL
THE CATHOLICS WOULD SOON BE UPPERMOST THE HERETICS SHOULD PAY FOR ALL RAVING AND BLASPHEMING INCESSANTLY LIKE A DEMONIAC
THEIR EARLY FRIENDSHIP WAS DISSOLVED ONE OF THEM BECAME THE CHIEF OF THE WHIG PARTY AND WAS IMPEACHED BY THE TORIES THE OTHER WAS ENTRUSTED WITH ALL THE MYSTERIES OF TORY DIPLOMACY AND WAS LONG KEPT CLOSE PRISONER BY THE WHIGS
AND WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THESE WORDS BY THE COUNT OF AVAUX POSITIVELY REFUSED EITHER TO RETRACT THEM OR TO EXPLAIN THEM AWAY
BOTH HAD KEEN AND VIGOROUS MINDS BOTH AFTERWARDS CLIMBED HIGH BOTH UNITED IN A REMARKABLE DEGREE THE LOVE OF LETTERS WITH SKILL IN THOSE DEPARTMENTS OF BUSINESS FOR WHICH MEN OF LETTERS GENERALLY HAVE A STRONG DISTASTE
PURITAN WRITERS WERE COMPELLED TO RESORT TO FOREIGN OR TO SECRET PRESSES PURITAN CONGREGATIONS COULD MEET ONLY BY NIGHT OR IN WASTE PLACES AND PURITAN MINISTERS WERE FORCED TO PREACH IN THE GARB OF COLLIERS OR OF SAILORS
GOOD PROTESTANTS WHOM NO EXERTIONS MUST BE SPARED TO CARRY IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING AND OF THE LORD LIEUTENANT AND THESE CANDIDATES WERE NOW GENERALLY RETURNED WITHOUT OPPOSITION THE PRINCE GAVE STRICT ORDERS
WILLIAM SAW WITH STERN DELIGHT HIS ADVERSARIES TOILING TO CLEAR AWAY OBSTACLE AFTER OBSTACLE FROM HIS PATH WHILE THEY RAISED AGAINST THEMSELVES THE ENMITY OF ALL SECTS HE LABOURED TO CONCILIATE ALL
THEY CONVERSED EVERY DAY LONG AND FREELY ABOUT THE STATE OF THE SHIPPING AND THE DOCK YARDS THE RESULT OF THIS INTIMACY WAS AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THAT THE KEEN AND VIGILANT FRENCHMAN
ON HIS AUSPICIOUS REAPPEARANCE JOIN THEIR ACCLAMATIONS TO THE ACCLAMATIONS OF HIS OLD FRIENDS THE CAVALIERS
HE DISGUISED HIMSELF AS WELL AS HE COULD
IF THE MISGOVERNMENT OF JAMES WERE SUFFERED TO CONTINUE IT MUST PRODUCE AT NO REMOTE TIME A POPULAR OUTBREAK WHICH MIGHT BE FOLLOWED BY A BARBAROUS PERSECUTION OF THE PAPISTS THE PRINCE DECLARED THAT TO AVERT THE HORRORS OF SUCH A PERSECUTION WAS ONE OF HIS CHIEF OBJECTS
IN A LETTER WRITTEN WITH A CERTAIN ELEVATION OF LANGUAGE WHICH WAS THE SURE MARK THAT HE WAS GOING TO COMMIT A BASENESS DECLARED THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO PERFORM HIS DUTY TO HEAVEN AND TO HIS COUNTRY AND THAT HE PUT HIS HONOUR ABSOLUTELY INTO THE HANDS OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
BUT EVEN RIGID PURITANS FORGOT THE SANCTITY OF THE DAY AND OF THE WORK THE CHURCHES POURED FORTH THEIR CONGREGATIONS AS THE TORTURER PASSED BY AND THE NOISE OF THREATS EXECRATIONS AND SCREAMS OF HATRED
WILLIAM FIRST RECEIVED ASSURANCES OF SUPPORT FROM A VERY DIFFERENT QUARTER THE HISTORY OF SUNDERLAND'S INTRIGUES IS COVERED WITH AN OBSCURITY WHICH IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT ANY INQUIRER WILL EVER SUCCEED IN PENETRATING BUT
AND SECRET INTELLIGENCE WAS STILL TRANSMITTED FROM THE WITTOL TO THE ADULTERESS FROM THE ADULTERESS TO THE GALLANT
AND HIS ACCENT WAS THAT OF HIS NATIVE GASCONY BUT HIS STRONG SENSE HIS KEEN PENETRATION AND HIS LIVELY WIT EMINENTLY QUALIFIED HIM FOR HIS POST
HAPPILY FOR HIM HE WAS NOT PUT TO THE BAR TILL THE FIRST BURST OF POPULAR RAGE HAD SPENT ITSELF AND TILL THE CREDIT OF THE FALSE WITNESSES HAD BEEN BLOWN UPON HE HAD THEREFORE ESCAPED
HE WAS NOW FREE BUT THIS DID NOT CONTENT HIM HE WISHED TO BE AGAIN GREAT ATTACHED AS HE WAS TO THE ANGLICAN CHURCH HOSTILE AS HE WAS TO THE FRENCH ASCENDENCY HE COULD NOT HOPE TO BE GREAT IN A COURT SWARMING WITH JESUITS AND OBSEQUIOUS TO THE HOUSE OF BOURBON
WENT THROUGH THE FORM OF TENDERING HIS BEST SERVICES TO LEWIS BUT THIS CIVILITY WAS RATED AT ITS TRUE VALUE AND REQUITED WITH A DRY REPRIMAND THE GREAT KING AFFECTED CONTEMPT FOR THE PETTY PRINCE
AND TO LET HIM KNOW IN WHAT WAY HE COULD BEST PROMOTE THE WELFARE OF THEIR COUNTRY HE THEN WITHDREW AND LEFT THEM TO DELIBERATE UNRESTRAINED BY HIS PRESENCE THEY REPAIRED TO THE COUNCIL CHAMBER AND PUT HAMILTON INTO THE CHAIR
THE ONLY LOSERS WOULD BE THE TYRCONNELS THE DOVERS THE ALBEVILLES AND THE OTHER POLITICAL ADVENTURERS WHO IN RETURN FOR FLATTERY AND EVIL COUNSEL HAD OBTAINED FROM THEIR CREDULOUS MASTER GOVERNMENTS REGIMENTS AND EMBASSIES
IMPROVIDENCE AND ECCENTRIC IMPUDENCE HE WAS IN TRUTH ONE OF THE MOST MERCENARY AND CRAFTY OF MANKIND HE WAS NOW NO LONGER YOUNG AND WAS EXPIATING BY SEVERE SUFFERINGS THE DISSOLUTENESS OF HIS YOUTH
THE FIRST SERVICE WHICH HE WAS REQUIRED TO PERFORM IN RETURN FOR HIS PENSION WAS TO DEFEND HIS CHURCH IN PROSE AGAINST STILLINGFLEET BUT THE ART OF SAYING THINGS WELL IS USELESS TO A MAN WHO HAS NOTHING TO SAY AND THIS WAS DRYDEN'S CASE
THE KING OF FRANCE OR THE CITY OF AMSTERDAM MIGHT STILL FRUSTRATE THE WHOLE PLAN IF LEWIS WERE TO SEND A GREAT FORCE INTO BRABANT
COULD NOT CONCLUDE ANY ALLIANCE OR LEVY ANY TAX WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE STATES OF EVERY PROVINCE THE STATES OF A PROVINCE COULD NOT GIVE SUCH CONSENT WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF EVERY MUNICIPALITY WHICH HAD A SHARE IN THE REPRESENTATION
AND ELECTED WITHOUT ANY CONTEST FOUR GREAT MERCHANTS WHO WERE ZEALOUS WHIGS THE KING AND HIS ADHERENTS HAD HOPED THAT MANY RETURNING OFFICERS WOULD TREAT THE PRINCE'S LETTER AS A NULLITY BUT THE HOPE WAS DISAPPOINTED
A SPIRIT AS FIERCE AND DETERMINED AS HIS OWN AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT
AND WHICH HAD TAKEN PART WITH THE CELTS IN THE REBELLION OF SIXTEEN FORTY ONE IN HIS YOUTH HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE MOST NOTED SHARPERS AND BULLIES OF LONDON HE HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO CHARLES AND JAMES WHEN THEY WERE EXILES IN FLANDERS
HE HAD DURING MANY YEARS EARNED HIS DAILY BREAD BY PANDARING TO THE VICIOUS TASTE OF THE PIT AND BY GROSSLY FLATTERING RICH AND NOBLE PATRONS SELFRESPECT AND A FINE SENSE OF THE BECOMING
DISCUSSING LITERARY QUESTIONS WITH WALLER AND SAINT EVREMOND AND CORRESPONDING WITH LA FONTAINE TO ACQUIRE A CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH POLITICS
AND CHANGED SIDES WITH A PROMPTITUDE THEN COMMON AMONG SCOTTISH POLITICIANS THE PRIVY COUNCIL BY ONE PROCLAMATION ORDERED THAT ALL PAPISTS SHOULD BE DISARMED AND BY ANOTHER INVITED PROTESTANTS TO MUSTER FOR THE DEFENCE OF PURE RELIGION
THAT OF A MAN WHOM A STRONG SENSE OF DUTY HAD CONSTRAINED TO TAKE A STEP OF AWFUL IMPORTANCE HAD HE BEEN SUCH A MAN THE SAME CONVICTION WHICH HAD LED HIM TO JOIN THE CHURCH OF ROME WOULD SURELY HAVE PREVENTED HIM FROM VIOLATING GROSSLY AND HABITUALLY
TO BE WELL PAID FOR HIS SERVICES AND SUCCEEDED IN ACQUIRING PARTLY BY THE SALE OF HIS INFLUENCE PARTLY BY GAMBLING AND PARTLY BY PIMPING AN ESTATE OF THREE THOUSAND POUNDS A YEAR FOR UNDER AN OUTWARD SHOW OF LEVITY PROFUSION
AND WHAT IS MORE EXTRAORDINARY HE HAD WON HER ENTIRE AFFECTION HE WAS TO HER IN THE PLACE OF THE PARENTS WHOM SHE HAD LOST BY DEATH AND BY ESTRANGEMENT
HE RECOVERED FROM MALADIES WHICH SEEMED HOPELESS THAT BANDS OF ASSASSINS CONSPIRED IN VAIN AGAINST HIS LIFE THAT THE OPEN SKIFF TO WHICH HE TRUSTED HIMSELF ON A STARLESS NIGHT ON A RAGING OCEAN AND NEAR A TREACHEROUS SHORE
EVEN WHEN HE RENDERED TO HER THOSE SERVICES OF WHICH AT THIS DAY WE FEEL THE HAPPY EFFECTS HER WELFARE WAS NOT HIS CHIEF OBJECT WHATEVER PATRIOTIC FEELING HE HAD WAS FOR HOLLAND
COULD NOT BE FALSE TO THE OTHER SHOULD BE DIVIDED BY A DEADLY ENMITY WHAT COURSE WAS THE ORTHODOX ROYALIST TO TAKE WHAT SITUATION COULD BE MORE TRYING THAN THAT IN WHICH HE WOULD BE PLACED
THE POPISH PRIESTS INDEED WERE IN EXILE IN HIDING OR IN PRISON
A TIME HAD ARRIVED AT WHICH IT WAS IMPORTANT TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY THAT THERE SHOULD BE ENTIRE CONCORD BETWEEN THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS TILL AFTER THE SUPPRESSION OF THE WESTERN INSURRECTION GRAVE CAUSES OF DISSENSION HAD SEPARATED WILLIAM
THEY HAD BEEN TAUGHT BY A CRUEL EXPERIENCE THAT THE ANTIPATHY OF THE NATION TO THEIR RELIGION WAS NOT A FANCY WHICH WOULD YIELD TO THE MANDATE OF A PRINCE BUT A PROFOUND SENTIMENT
THERE WAS SCARCELY ONE EMINENT PEER ATTACHED TO THE OLD FAITH WHOSE HONOUR WHOSE ESTATE WHOSE LIFE HAD NOT BEEN IN JEOPARDY WHO HAD NOT PASSED MONTHS IN THE TOWER
SIDNEY SOUNDED HALIFAX SHREWSBURY TOOK HIS PART WITH A COURAGE AND DECISION WHICH AT A LATER PERIOD SEEMED TO BE WANTING TO HIS CHARACTER HE AT ONCE AGREED TO SET HIS ESTATE HIS HONOURS AND HIS LIFE ON THE STAKE BUT HALIFAX RECEIVED THE FIRST HINT
THE TORIES HAD FORMERLY TAKEN THEIR STAND ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NONRESISTANCE BUT THAT GROUND MOST OF THEM HAD NOW ABANDONED AND WERE NOT DISPOSED AGAIN TO OCCUPY THE CAVALIERS OF ENGLAND HAD AS A CLASS
THEY ARE REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK I COULDN'T GET ALONG WITHOUT THEM THEY SAVE ME A LOT OF RUNNING BACK AND FORTH I CAN TELL YOU AND THE OTHER GREAT DIFFERENCE SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE
WHO ARE THRIFTY AND WHO LIVE LARGELY ON SMALL SEEDS WITHOUT POCKETS IN WHICH TO CARRY THE SEEDS
HE HAD FOUND MY TRACKS WHERE I HAD BEEN GATHERING BEECHNUTS AND HE WAS FOLLOWING THEM WITH HIS NOSE JUST THE WAY BOWSER THE HOUND FOLLOWS REDDY FOX I NEARLY DIED OF FRIGHT WHEN I SAW HIM
AGAIN UNC BILLY GRINNED AND THEN PULLED HIMSELF BACK TO THE OTHER BRANCH OLD MOTHER NATURE SHOOK HER HEAD REPROVINGLY UNC BILLY SAID SHE
TO MIGRATE IS TO MOVE FROM ONE PART OF THE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER YOU KNOW MOST OF THE BIRDS MIGRATE TO THE SUNNY SOUTH EVERY AUTUMN AND BACK EVERY SPRING
OF RUNNING DECLARED JUMPER
GUESS I WOULDN'T BE IF REDDY FOX HADN'T HAPPENED ALONG JUST THEN AND FRIGHTENED SHADOW AWAY
AND DOESN'T LIKE THE LIGHT OF DAY HOW BIG IS HE ASKED HAPPY JACK AND LOOKED A LITTLE SHEEPISH AS IF HE WERE A WEE BIT ASHAMED OF NOT BEING ACQUAINTED WITH ONE OF HIS OWN COUSINS
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE
DOES HE EAT NUTS LIKE HIS COUSINS ASKED PETER RABBIT HE CERTAINLY DOES REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE ALSO HE EATS GRUBS AND INSECTS HE DEARLY LOVES A FAT BEETLE
SO HE SELDOM GOES FAR FROM HIS OWN DOORSTEP PETER LEFT HIM GRUMBLING AND GROWLING AND CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH HE KNEW THAT JOHNNY CHUCK WOULD NOT DARE DISOBEY OLD MOTHER NATURE
ALL THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL PETER RABBIT DID HIS BEST TO THINK WHO IT COULD BE WHO ATE FLESH YET WASN'T A MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS
HE LOVES GRASSY WEEDY OR BRUSHY PLACES AS A RULE HE DOES LITTLE HARM TO MAN FOR HIS FOOD IS CHIEFLY SEEDS OF WEEDS SMALL WILD FRUITS AND PARTS OF WILD PLANTS
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU UNC BILLY DIDN'T SO MUCH AS WINK AN EYE FARMER BROWN'S BOY WENT OFF UP THE PATH CARRYING UNC BILLY BY THE TAIL BY AND BY HE LAID UNC BILLY DOWN
WHO ALSO IS RATHER FOND OF THE GREEN MEADOWS I OUGHT TO HAVE SENT WORD TO HIM TO BE HERE THIS MORNING HARDLY WERE THE WORDS OUT OF OLD MOTHER NATURE'S MOUTH WHEN SOMETHING LANDED IN THE LEAVES ALMOST AT HER FEET AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF SCHOOL
EXCLAIMED OLD MOTHER NATURE WHAT HAVE YOU COME FOR STRIPED CHIPMUNK I'VE COME TO TRY TO LEARN WILL YOU LET ME STAY MOTHER NATURE REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK OF COURSE I'LL LET YOU STAY
DON'T KNOW A SINGLE GOOD THING ABOUT HIM HE CONTINUED BUT I KNOW PLENTY OF BAD THINGS HE IS THE ONE ENEMY I FEAR MORE THAN ANY OTHER BECAUSE HE IS THE ONE WHO CAN GO WHEREVER I CAN
I HAVE A LOT OF ENEMIES SOMETIMES IT SEEMS AS IF ALMOST EVERY ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS IS LOOKING FOR A MOUSE DINNER BUT ALL BUT SHADOW THE WEASEL HUNT ME WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY AND NEED FOOD
A FELLOW NEVER KNOWS WHERE TO WATCH OUT FOR YOWLER I SPENT NEARLY ALL NIGHT SITTING UNDER A LITTLE HEMLOCK TREE WITH BRANCHES VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND I SAT THERE BECAUSE I DIDN'T DARE DO ANYTHING ELSE
I GUESS HE MUST HAVE SEEN THAT MOUSE GO IN A HOLE AND KNEW THAT IF HE WAITED LONG ENOUGH IT WOULD COME OUT AGAIN AS SOON AS YOWLER DISAPPEARED I HURRIED OVER HERE THAT'S ALL THAT WAS A SPLENDID ACCOUNT OF YOWLER AND HIS WAY OF HUNTING SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE
THEN HE WRAPPED THE END OF HIS TAIL AROUND THE BRANCH AND SWUNG HIMSELF OFF KEEPING HOLD OF THE BRANCH ONLY WITH HIS TAIL AND ONE HIND FOOT THEN
BEGAN PETER IN FACT HE IS THE SMALLEST SQUIRREL I KNOW PETER PAUSED OLD MOTHER NATURE NODDED ENCOURAGINGLY GO ON
BUT THOSE FOLKS DON'T KNOW UNC BILLY HE LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THAT HE CAN'T RUN AS FAST AS SOME OTHERS SO HE HAS LEARNED TO DEPEND ON HIS WITS IN TIME OF DANGER WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DOES I
WHO CHANGES THE COLOR OF HIS COAT IN SUMMER HE WEARS BEAUTIFUL SHADES OF REDDISH BROWN AND GRAY BUT IN WINTER HIS COAT IS WHOLLY WHITE HE IS ALSO CALLED THE HUDSON BAY LEMMING DANNY MEADOW MOUSE THINKS HIS TAIL IS SHORT
DANNY DECIDED TO DO THE SAME THING IN A COMFORTABLE PLACE UNDER A PILE OF BRUSH NOT FAR AWAY SO THE NEXT MORNING BOTH WERE ON HAND WHEN SCHOOL OPENED I TOLD YOU YESTERDAY THAT I WOULD TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF DANNY'S COUSINS
IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN THE WAY HE CAN STEER HIMSELF AROUND IT WHEN HE REACHES THE TREE HE IS JUMPING FOR HE SHOOTS UP A LITTLE WAY AND LANDS ON THE TRUNK NOT FAR ABOVE THE GROUND THEN HE SCAMPERS UP THAT TREE TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN
IF I COULD CLIMB A TREE LIKE CHATTERER IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT NO IT WOULDN'T
YET DOESN'T BELONG TO THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS
ON MY WAY HERE I SAW UNC BILLY AND IT POPPED INTO MY HEAD RIGHT AWAY THAT HE WAS ONE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT AND MUST BE THE ONE BUT IF HE EATS FLESH
HE LOOKED JUST LIKE WHAT HE IS A BIG CAT WITH A SHORT TAIL REPLIED JUMPER JUST TO LOOK AT HIM ANY ONE WOULD KNOW HE WAS OWN COUSIN TO BLACK PUSSY HE HAD A ROUND HEAD RATHER LONG LEGS AND WAS ABOUT TWICE AS BIG AS BLACK PUSSY
IT WASN'T FOR YOUR BENEFIT THAT I SENT WORD FOR YOU TO BE HERE THIS MORNING IT WAS FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS NOW SIT UP SO THAT ALL CAN GET A GOOD LOOK AT YOU
JOHNNY CHUCK CERTAINLY IS RIGHT AT HOME WHEN IT COMES TO DIGGING YOU OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL THAT HE IS SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE FOR THE HOLES HE HAS DUG HAVE SAVED YOUR LIFE MORE THAN ONCE BY THE WAY PETER SINCE YOU ARE SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THOSE HOLES
BY DAY THE ENTRANCES ARE CLOSED WITH EARTH FROM INSIDE FOR THE MICE ARE ACTIVE ONLY AT NIGHT SOMETIMES THE BURROWS ARE HIDDEN UNDER BUSHES AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN
AND A COUPLE WERE IN THE BIG POCKET WHERE THEY HAD SPENT THEIR BABYHOOD WE ALL DONE THOUGHT WE'D COME TO SCHOOL EXPLAINED UNC BILLY WITH A GRIN
YOU ARE A BAD OLD RASCAL TO STEAL EGGS WHAT'S MORE
ANY HOLE I CAN GET INTO HE CAN I'VE SEEN HIM JUST TWICE IN MY LIFE AND I HOPE I MAY NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE
JUST AS IS ROBBER THE RAT BECAUSE OF HIS SMALL SIZE HE CAN GO WHERE ROBBER CANNOT HE DELIGHTS TO SCAMPER ABOUT BETWEEN THE WALLS
WHILE HIS COUSINS OF THE TREES HAVE NO POCKETS AT ALL
HE LIKES TO GET INTO OLD BUILDINGS DOES HE HAVE MANY ENEMIES ASKED HAPPY JACK THE SAME ENEMIES THE REST OF YOU HAVE REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE BUT THE ONE HE HAS MOST REASON TO FEAR
HE GETS INTO SO MUCH MISCHIEF IN THE GRAIN FIELDS AND IN THE ORCHARDS THAT HE IS QUITE AS MUCH DISLIKED AS IS JACK RABBIT THIS PARTICULAR MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IS QUITE AS MUCH AT HOME AMONG ROCKS AND TREE ROOTS AS IN OPEN GROUND
WITH A LONG HAIRLESS TAIL AND EARS OF GOOD SIZE HE IS VERY TIMID READY TO DART INTO HIS HOLE AT THE LEAST SOUND HE RAISES FROM FOUR TO NINE BABIES AT A TIME
TUFTY'S WAYS ARE MUCH LIKE THOSE OF HIS COUSIN YOWLER SAVE THAT HE IS A DWELLER IN THE DEEP WOODS ANYTHING HE CAN CATCH IS FOOD FOR TUFTY BUT HIS PRINCIPAL FOOD IS THE NORTHERN HARE THE COLOR OF HIS COAT BLENDS WITH THE SHADOWS SO THAT HE SEEMS LIKE A LIVING SHADOW HIMSELF
I WASN'T HALF TRYING WHEN I LANDED HERE I'M SORRY I FRIGHTENED ALL OF YOU SO
AND THERE WERE TWO BRANCH TUNNELS LEADING UP TO THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND MAKING SIDE OR BACK DOORWAYS THERE WAS NO SAND AROUND EITHER OF THESE AND THEY WERE QUITE HIDDEN BY THE LONG GRASS HANGING OVER THEM
IT IS BECAUSE THE MOTHERS HAVE BIG POCKETS IN WHICH THEY CARRY THEIR BABIES OLD MISSUS POSSUM HAS JUST SUCH A POCKET
ANOTHER MOUSE OF THE WEST LOOKS ALMOST ENOUGH LIKE WHITEFOOT TO BE A MEMBER OF HIS BRANCH OF THE FAMILY HE HAS A BEAUTIFUL YELLOWISH BROWN COAT AND WHITE WAISTCOAT AND HIS FEET ARE WHITE
YOU REMEMBER HAD LAUGHED AT PETER RABBIT FOR WANTING TO GO TO SCHOOL NO M A R M THERE ARE
WE UNS HAVEN'T HAD BREAKFAST YET SO WE UNS ARE FEELING PO'LY REPLIED UNC BILLY WITH A GRIN A SUDDEN THOUGHT POPPED INTO PETER'S HEAD
LONG BEAUTIFUL JUMP THAT EVERYBODY EXCLAIMED THIS WAY AND THAT WAY HE WENT IN GREAT LEAPS IT WAS TRULY WONDERFUL THAT LONG TAIL IS WHAT BALANCES HIM EXPLAINED OLD MOTHER NATURE
THE VERY NICEST KIND OF A BED FOR THE BABIES NO ONE HAS A NEATER HOME THAN THE HARVEST MOUSE HE IS QUITE AS MUCH AT HOME IN BUSHES AND LOW TREES AS HAPPY JACK SQUIRREL IS IN BIGGER TREES
HE HAS SOME LARGER COUSINS ONE OF THEM BEING A LITTLE BIGGER THAN NIBBLER THE HOUSE MOUSE NEIGHBORS AND CLOSE RELATIVES ARE THE SPINY POCKET MICE DO THEY
IN THE FALL I DIG A DEEP BURROW DEEP ENOUGH TO BE BEYOND THE REACH OF JACK FROST AND IN A NICE LITTLE BEDROOM DOWN THERE I SLEEP THE WINTER AWAY I HAVE LITTLE STOREROOMS DOWN THERE TOO IN WHICH I PUT SEEDS BERRIES AND NUTS
HIS BIG SOFT EYES WERE SHINING WITH EXCITEMENT YOU LOOK AS THOUGH YOU HAD HAD AN ADVENTURE JUMPER SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE I HAVE REPLIED JUMPER IT IS A WONDER I AM HERE AT ALL
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STRIPED CHIPMUNK AND HIS COUSINS THE TREE SQUIRRELS PETER LOOKED VERY HARD AT STRIPED CHIPMUNK AS IF HE HAD NEVER REALLY SEEN HIM BEFORE HE IS SMALLER THAN THEY ARE
AND NOW WE COME TO NIBBLER THE HOUSE MOUSE WHO LIKE ROBBER THE BROWN RAT HAS NO BUSINESS HERE AT ALL BUT WHO HAS FOLLOWED MAN ALL OVER THE WORLD
A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH IN THE EAST IS A COUSIN VERY MUCH LIKE HIM CALLED THE NEW YORK WEASEL ON THE GREAT PLAINS OF THE WEST IS A LARGER COUSIN WITH A LONGER TAIL CALLED THE LONG TAILED WEASEL
YOU KNOW THE MOON WAS VERY BRIGHT LAST NIGHT IT MADE THAT OPEN PLACE IN FRONT OF WHERE I WAS HIDING ALMOST AS LIGHT AS DAY ONCE I CLOSED MY EYES FOR JUST A MINUTE WHEN I OPENED THEM THERE WAS YOWLER SNEAKING ACROSS THAT OPEN PLACE WHERE HE HAD COME FROM I DON'T KNOW
IT IS A WONDER HE WASN'T LIVING IN FARMER BROWN'S HOUSE SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE PROBABLY OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY WERE HE IS PERFECTLY AT HOME IN ANY BUILDING PUT UP BY MAN
EVERY FEW HOPS HE WOULD STOP TO THINK BUT ALL HIS STOPPING AND ALL HIS THINKING WERE IN VAIN AND WHEN HE STARTED FOR SCHOOL THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS AS PUZZLED AS EVER
I CAN CLIMB IF I WANT TO AND I DO SOMETIMES BUT PREFER THE GROUND GO ON PETER SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE HE SEEMS TO LIKE OLD STONE WALLS AND ROCK PILES CONTINUED PETER
AND ONCE IN A WHILE ONLY ONE BUT THAT ISN'T REALLY SAFE
CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR UNC BILLY AND OLD MISSUS POSSUM
A LITTLE ROUND BALL OF GRASS AND OTHER VEGETABLE MATTER THIS IS PLACED IN THICK GRASS OR WEEDS CLOSE TO THE GROUND OR IN BUSHES OR LOW TREES SEVERAL FEET FROM THE GROUND
SOMETIMES HOWEVER IF WE CANNOT FIND A PLACE THAT JUST SUITS US WE GO QUITE A DISTANCE ARE YOUR BABIES BORN DOWN IN THAT LITTLE BEDROOM IN THE GROUND ASKED JUMPER THE HARE OF COURSE REPLIED JOHNNY CHUCK
AND FORGOTTEN TO BRUSH HIS HAIR IT POINTED EVERY WHICH WAY HIS LEGS WERE DARK HIS FEET BLACK AND HIS TOES WHITE HIS EARS WERE WITHOUT ANY HAIR AT ALL
THAT IT MAKES ME SHIVER JUST TO THINK OF IT I GUESS IF I HADN'T BEEN THINKING ABOUT HIM HE WOULD HAVE CAUGHT ME TELL US ALL ABOUT IT DEMANDED OLD MOTHER NATURE SEEING BLACK PUSSY OVER HERE YESTERDAY AND KNOWING THAT TO DAY'S LESSON WAS TO BE ABOUT YOWLER
MAN BROUGHT HIM HERE AND NOW HE IS HERE TO STAY AND QUITE AS MUCH AT HOME AS IF HE BELONGED HERE THE WAY THE REST OF YOU DO THIS FINISHES THE LESSONS ON THE ORDER OF RODENTS
BECAUSE I HAVE IT HIDDEN UNDERNEATH THE STONE WALL ON THE EDGE OF THE OLD ORCHARD REPLIED STRIPED CHIPMUNK BUT EVEN THEN I SHOULD THINK THAT ALL THE SAND YOU MUST HAVE TAKEN OUT WOULD GIVE YOUR SECRET AWAY CRIED PETER
SHE SEEMED TO HAVE HEADS AND TAILS ALL OVER HER YOU SEE SHE HAD BROUGHT ALONG HER FAMILY AND OL MISSUS POSSUM IS ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN LARGE FAMILIES
HE DOES MOST OF HIS HUNTING IN JUST THAT WAY SNEAKING ABOUT ON THE CHANCE OF SURPRISING A RABBIT BIRD OR MOUSE OR ELSE PATIENTLY WATCHING AND WAITING BESIDE A HOLE IN WHICH HE KNOWS SOME ONE HAS TAKEN REFUGE
HE WAS ABOUT AS LONG AS CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL BUT LOOKED LONGER BECAUSE OF HIS SLIM BODY AND LONG NECK HE WAS BROWN ABOVE AND WHITE BELOW HIS FRONT FEET WERE WHITE AND HIS HIND FEET
BUT ALL THE FIGHT GOES OUT OF HIM WHEN SHADOW APPEARS PERHAPS IT IS BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW HOPELESS IT IS WHEN SHADOW FINDS A BARN OVERRUN WITH RATS HE WILL SOMETIMES STAY UNTIL HE HAS KILLED OR DRIVEN OUT THE LAST ONE
THEY ARE WELL BUILT LITTLE HOUSES AND HAVE ONE OR MORE LITTLE DOORWAYS ON THE UNDER SIDE WHEN THEY ARE IN BUSHES OR TREES INSIDE IS A WARM SOFT BED
INSTANTLY DANNY MEADOW MOUSE SCURRIED UNDER A PILE OF DEAD LEAVES WHITEFOOT THE WOOD MOUSE DARTED INTO A KNOTHOLE IN THE LOG ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN SITTING JUMPER THE HARE DODGED BEHIND A LITTLE HEMLOCK TREE
HIS JUMPING IS DONE ONLY IN TIMES OF DANGER WHEN HE IS NOT ALARMED HE RUNS ABOUT ON THE GROUND LIKE THE REST OF THE MOUSE FAMILY
REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE HOP UP ON THAT LOG SIDE OF YOUR COUSIN WHITEFOOT WHERE ALL CAN SEE YOU NIMBLEHEELS HOPPED UP BESIDE WHITEFOOT THE WOOD MOUSE AND AS THE TWO LITTLE COUSINS SAT SIDE BY SIDE
AS LONG AS I STAYED THERE I FELT REASONABLY SAFE BECAUSE YOWLER WOULD HAVE TO FIND ME AND TO DO THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO CROSS AN OPEN PLACE WHERE I COULD SEE HIM I KNEW THAT IF I WENT ROAMING ABOUT I MIGHT WALK RIGHT INTO HIS CLUTCHES
SOMETIMES I HAVE MORE THAN ONE STOREROOM ALSO I HAVE SOME LITTLE SIDE TUNNELS BUT WHY IS IT I NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO YOUR TUNNEL ASKED PETER AS FULL OF CURIOSITY AS EVER
AND WHEN SHE HAD REACHED A COMFORTABLE CROTCH THE LITTLE POSSUMS LEFT HER AND BEGAN TO PLAY ABOUT IN THE TREE IT WAS THEN THAT IT APPEARED WHAT HANDY THINGS THOSE NAKED LITTLE TAILS WERE
CHAPTER SEVEN JOHNNY CHUCK JOINS THE CLASS
NO REPLIED JOHNNY CHUCK GIVE ME GREEN FOOD EVERY TIME THERE IS NOTHING SO GOOD AS TENDER SWEET CLOVER AND YOUNG GRASS UNLESS IT BE SOME OF THOSE FINE VEGETABLES FARMER BROWN GROWS IN HIS GARDEN
ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE I HAVE REPLIED DANNY MEADOW MOUSE ONCE I WAS CARRIED TO FARMER BROWN'S BARN IN A SHOCK OF CORN AND I FOUND NIBBLER LIVING IN THE BARN
IT ISN'T MUCH OF A JUMP TO GO OVER YOUR HEAD REPLIED NIMBLEHEELS
HE HUNTS IN THE GREEN FOREST EXACTLY AS BLACK PUSSY FARMER BROWN'S CAT HUNTS MICE IN THE BARN OR BIRDS IN THE OLD ORCHARD IN THE SPRING YOWLER DESTROYS MANY EGGS AND YOUNG BIRDS NOT ONLY THOSE FOUND IN NESTS ON THE GROUND BUT ALSO THOSE IN NESTS IN TREES
THEY PEEPED OUT TO SEE WHAT HAD FRIGHTENED THEM SO JUST IMAGINE HOW VERY VERY FOOLISH THEY FELT WHEN THEY SAW OLD MOTHER NATURE SMILING DOWN AT A LITTLE FELLOW JUST ABOUT THE SIZE OF LITTLE WHITEFOOT BUT WITH A MUCH LONGER TAIL
AND IT WAS JUST LUCK THAT I WASN'T AT HOME WHEN HE CALLED I WAS JUST RETURNING WHEN HE POPPED OUT
PEACE BETWEEN THE FLORENTINES AND THE LUCCHESE THE FLORENTINES EFFECT A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE POPE AND THE COUNT DI POPPI THE POPE CONSECRATES THE CHURCH OF SANTA REPARATA COUNCIL OF FLORENCE
THE ELDEST SON OF MASO WHO BY HIS OWN TALENTS AND THE RESPECT HE DERIVED FROM THE MEMORY OF HIS FATHER ASPIRED TO THE FIRST OFFICES IN THE GOVERNMENT
THE COUNT WOULD NOT CONSENT TO PASS THE PO AND THE VENETIANS REFUSED TO ACCEPT HIM ON ANY OTHER CONDITION SEEING NO OTHER METHOD OF ARRANGEMENT THAN THAT EACH SHOULD MAKE LIBERAL CONCESSIONS THE FLORENTINES INDUCED THE COUNT TO CROSS THE RIVER
WHEN ONE OF THESE PROVINCES HAD TO BE RELIEVED OF ITS SUPERABUNDANT POPULATION WAS TO DIVIDE INTO THREE PARTS EACH CONTAINING AN EQUAL NUMBER OF NOBLES AND OF PEOPLE OF RICH AND OF POOR THE THIRD UPON WHOM THE LOT FELL
WHICH HE OBTAINED ON CONDITION OF GIVING UP ZAGONARA IF THE FLORENTINES DID NOT RELIEVE HIM WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS THIS MISFORTUNE BEING KNOWN IN THE FLORENTINE CAMP AND IN THE CITY
IN THE SAME WAY IT WOULD BE WRONG TO BLAME A WISE RESOLUTION
DECLARING THAT TO GRATIFY THEMSELVES AND OPPRESS THE PEOPLE THEY WOULD GO TO WAR WITHOUT ANY JUSTIFIABLE MOTIVE THEY HAD NOT YET COME TO AN OPEN RUPTURE WITH THE DUKE
FOR THEY WILL NOT WILLINGLY SEE THE POWER OF FLORENCE INCREASED ON A FORMER OCCASION THE FLORENTINES WERE MORE AT LIBERTY THEY HAD GREATER HOPE OF ASSISTANCE AND WERE MORE POWERFUL IN THEMSELVES WHILE WE WERE IN EVERY RESPECT WEAKER
AND THAT IN THE INTERIM SOME EVENT WOULD OCCUR FOR THEIR RELIEF AS HAD BEEN THE CASE DURING THE FORMER WARS WHICH THE FLORENTINES HAD CARRIED ON AGAINST THEM THEIR ONLY APPREHENSION AROSE FROM THE FICKLE MINDS OF THE PLEBEIANS WHO BECOMING WEARY OF THE SIEGE
EVIDENTLY DESIROUS THAT THE HONOR AND ADVANTAGE OF THE VICTORY AT CARAVAGGIO SHOULD BE HIS OWN AND NOT ACCRUE TO THE MILANESE THE PARTIES THEREFORE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE VENETIANS UNDERTOOK TO PAY THE COUNT THIRTEEN THOUSAND FLORINS PER MONTH TILL HE SHOULD OBTAIN MILAN
BUT SHE BEING OF IMPERIAL BLOOD SCORNED THE CONNECTION OF A PRIVATE CITIZEN AND BEING ANXIOUS TO AVENGE HERSELF FOR THE INSULT SECRETLY PERSUADED GENSERIC KING OF THE VANDALS AND MASTER OF AFRICA TO COME TO ITALY
AND LAPO NICCOLINI THE FACTIONS THAT AROSE FROM THE QUARRELS OF THE ALBIZZI AND THE RICCI AND WHICH WERE AFTERWARD SO UNHAPPILY REVIVED BY SALVESTRO DE MEDICI
IT THEREFORE SEEMED NECESSARY TO CURB HIS INSOLENCE AND NOT ALLOW IT TO INCREASE TILL IT BECAME INCORRIGIBLE AND THAT IF THE FLORENTINES FROM FEAR OR ANY OTHER MOTIVE WISHED TO PRESERVE HIS FRIENDSHIP THEY MUST PAY HIM THEMSELVES COSMO RETURNED
THESE THINGS DISTURBED THE MINDS OF THE CITIZENS AND MADE THEM APPREHENSIVE OF NEW TROUBLES CONSIDER THE MEANS TO BE ADOPTED FOR THEIR DEFENSE
AND THE FUTURE EXPENSE WOULD NOT BE SO GREAT AS THE FORMER HAD BEEN FOR LESS PREPARATION IS NECESSARY FOR THOSE ENGAGED IN SELF DEFENSE THAN FOR THOSE WHO DESIGN TO ATTACK OTHERS
BUT IF WE FOUND WE COULD NOT ULTIMATELY DEFEND IT WE WOULD SUBMIT OURSELVES TO ANYONE RATHER THAN TO THEE AND IF OUR SINS BE SO GREAT THAT IN SPITE OF OUR UTMOST RESOLUTION WE SHOULD STILL FALL INTO THY HANDS BE QUITE ASSURED
DESTROYED THAT VIGILANCE OVER THOSE WHO MIGHT INJURE THEM WHICH THEY OUGHT TO HAVE EXERCISED THUS DAILY RENEWING THE HATRED OF A MASS OF THE PEOPLE BY THEIR SINISTER PROCEEDINGS
HE REMINDED THEM OF THE INIQUITY OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH WAS IN POWER FROM THIRTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
OR SUBMIT TO ANY TERMS THAT COULD VIOLATE THEIR LIBERTY THEY THEN MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE CITY IN THE MEANTIME THE FLORENTINE FORCES WERE NOT IDLE AND AFTER INNUMERABLE MISCHIEFS DONE TO THE COUNTRY
AND WITH WHAT GLORY WE HAVE MAINTAINED OUR DEFENSE WE HAVE OFTEN BEEN DEPRIVED OF EVERY HOPE EXCEPT IN GOD AND THE CASUALTIES WHICH TIME MIGHT PRODUCE AND BOTH HAVE PROVED OUR FRIENDS AND AS THEY HAVE DELIVERED US FORMERLY
AND THAT IF TO THE BENEFITS HE HAD CONFERRED ON THEE OUR OWN WERE ADDED THE FRIENDSHIP WE SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH WOULD NOT ONLY BE FIRM BUT INSEPARABLE WITH THIS IMPRESSION WE ADDED VERONA OR BRESCIA TO THY PREVIOUS APPOINTMENTS
AND THOUGHT HIS PROCEEDINGS NEED NOT HAVE EXCITED SO MUCH DISTRUST THAT APPOINTING THE TEN AND HIRING FORCES WAS IN ITSELF A MANIFEST DECLARATION OF WAR WHICH IF UNDERTAKEN AGAINST SO GREAT A PRINCE
DESCRIBING THE CONDITION OF THE CITY AND SHOWING HOW BY THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE IT HAD AGAIN FALLEN UNDER THE POWER OF THE PLEBEIANS FROM WHOM IT HAD BEEN WRESTED BY THEIR FATHERS IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE
AND TO MAKE ALL SENSIBLE OF ITS INJUSTICE THEY CONTRIVED THAT THE TAXES SHOULD BE LEVIED WITH THE UTMOST RIGOR AND MADE IT LAWFUL TO KILL ANY THAT MIGHT RESIST THE OFFICERS EMPLOYED TO COLLECT THEM
AND BEGGED THE COUNT TO ENDEAVOR TO EFFECT AN ACCOMMODATION BETWEEN THE FLORENTINES AND THE LUCCHESE INCLUDING HIMSELF IN IT IF HE WERE ABLE DECLARING AT THE SAME TIME THE PROMISED MARRIAGE SHOULD BE SOLEMNIZED WHENEVER HE THOUGHT PROPER
FOR THE VENETIANS CONFIDENT OF PEACE WERE SLOW IN PREPARING FOR WAR AND THE MILANESE FINDING THE TRUCE CONCLUDED THE ENEMY WITHDRAWN AND THE VENETIANS THEIR FRIENDS FELT ASSURED THAT THE COUNT HAD DETERMINED TO ABANDON HIS DESIGN
THOU RECEIVEDST FROM US AN UNHOPED FOR BENEFIT AND WE IN RETURN AN UNMERITED WRONG NEITHER HAST THOU DEFERRED UNTIL NOW THE MANIFESTATION OF THY BASE DESIGNS FOR NO SOONER WERT THOU APPOINTED TO COMMAND OUR ARMIES THAN
IT WOULD THUS BE EVIDENT THAT THE INJURY DONE TO ONE PARTY
AND OVERTURN THE GOVERNMENT WHICH FOR FORTY TWO YEARS HAD RULED THE CITY WITH SO MUCH GLORY THE CITIZENS WOULD THEN BE SUBJECT TO THE WILL OF THE MULTITUDE AND LIVE DISORDERLY AND DANGEROUS
HE REFUSED TO GIVE THEM UP TO THE POPE WHO DEMANDED THEM AS PROPERTY HELD OF THE CHURCH AND WHO UPON HIS REFUSAL SENT THE PATRIARCH WITH FORCES TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THEM THE COUNT FINDING HIMSELF UNABLE TO SUSTAIN THE ATTACK OFFERED THEM TO THE FLORENTINES
AND PREPARE TO FRUSTRATE THE ENEMY'S DESIGNS AND IF HE WERE TO REMAIN QUIET IT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY TO GO TO WAR WITH HIM
AFTER THIS SEVERAL IMPORTANT EVENTS OCCURRED BOTH IN ITALY
WHO WERE CONQUERED BY CAIUS MARIUS WAS THE VISIGOTHS WHICH NAME IN OUR LANGUAGE SIGNIFIES WESTERN GOTHS THESE AFTER SOME BATTLES FOUGHT ALONG ITS CONFINES LONG HELD THEIR SEAT OF DOMINION UPON THE DANUBE WITH CONSENT OF THE EMPERORS
THE LUCCHESE AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED SEEING THE IMMINENT PERIL OF THEIR SITUATION HAD RECOURSE TO THE DUKE AND EMPLOYED PRAYERS AND REMONSTRANCES TO INDUCE HIM TO RENDER THEM AID THEY ENLARGED UPON THEIR OWN MERITS AND THE OFFENSES OF THE FLORENTINES
BEING PRESSED BY THE VISIGOTHS AND UNABLE TO RESIST THEM WERE INVITED BY BONIFACE WHO GOVERNED AFRICA FOR THE EMPIRE TO OCCUPY THAT PROVINCE FOR BEING IN REBELLION HE WAS AFRAID HIS ERROR WOULD BECOME KNOWN TO THE EMPEROR
COSMO DE MEDICI DISPOSED TO DO SO THE FLORENTINES SENT AMBASSADORS TO THE COUNT AFTER THIS VICTORY THE COUNT MARCHED INTO THE BRESCIAN TERRITORY OCCUPIED THE WHOLE COUNTRY AND THEN PITCHED HIS CAMP WITHIN TWO MILES OF THE CITY THE VENETIANS
HE RESTORED OUR LIBERTY IT IS REASONABLE TO EXPECT HE WILL DEFEND IT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE GREATEST FOE OF OUR INVETERATE ENEMIES IF THEREFORE TO AVOID INCENSING THE FLORENTINES WE HAD EXCITED HIS ANGER WE SHOULD HAVE LOST OUR BEST FRIEND
LIVING IN A HEALTHY AND PROLIFIC REGION FREQUENTLY INCREASE TO SUCH VAST MULTITUDES THAT PART OF THEM ARE COMPELLED TO ABANDON THEIR NATIVE SOIL AND SEEK A HABITATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES THE METHOD ADOPTED
THE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF WAR WERE GREATLY STRENGTHENED BUT
A PEOPLE OF GERMANY TO THEIR AID AND THESE UNDER VORTIGERN THEIR KING FIRST DEFENDED AND THEN DROVE THEM FROM THE ISLAND OF WHICH THEY TOOK POSSESSION AND AFTER THEMSELVES NAMED THE COUNTRY ENGLAND
WHICH COULD NEVER BE UNITED TO INJURE OTHERS AND SEPARATELY ARE UNABLE TO DO SO TO ATTAIN THIS HE SAW NO BETTER MEANS THAN TO REFRAIN FROM AIDING THE COUNT AND CONTINUING IN THE FORMER LEAGUE WITH THE VENETIANS THESE REASONINGS WERE NOT SATISFACTORY TO COSMO'S FRIENDS
THAT IF WE ARE TO APPLAUD EVIL COUNSELS BECAUSE THEY ARE SOMETIMES FOLLOWED BY FORTUNATE EVENTS WE SHOULD ONLY ENCOURAGE MEN IN ERROR WHICH WOULD BRING GREAT MISCHIEF UPON THE REPUBLIC
UPON WHICH THEY PROCEEDED TO THE BUILDING ACCOMPANIED BY THOSE CIVIC MAGISTRATES AND OTHER OFFICERS WHO WERE APPOINTED TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION THE USUAL CEREMONIES OF CONSECRATION HAVING BEEN COMPLETED THE POPE TO SHOW HIS AFFECTION FOR THE CITY
IT WOULD THUS BE MANIFEST THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO COMPLAIN WHEN HE HAD EFFECTED THE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH THEY FIRST ATTEMPTED TO MAKE AND THAT IF HE HAD DEFERRED TO DO SO A LITTLE LONGER
SLEW THE ONE AND COMPELLED THE OTHER WITH HIS HUNS TO REPASS THE DANUBE AND RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY
SO THAT IF HE WERE UNMOVED BY GRATITUDE TO THEM HE MIGHT BE INDUCED TO THEIR DEFENSE BY MOTIVES OF COMPASSION THE DUKE INFLUENCED BY HIS INVETERATE HOSTILITY AGAINST THE FLORENTINES HIS NEW OBLIGATION TO THE LUCCHESE
UNDER THE GUARDIANSHIP OF FILIPPO THE BOY'S MOTHER SUSPICIOUS OF HIS GUARDIAN SENT HIM TO LODOVICO ALIDOSSI HER FATHER WHO WAS LORD OF IMOLA BUT SHE WAS COMPELLED
MIGHT BE UNABLE TO PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF HIS GRANDSON AGNOLO APPROACHED IMOLA WHILE THE FORCES OF THE FLORENTINES WERE AT MODIGLIANA
THEY HIRED COUNT ALBERIGO WHO FROM ZAGONARA HIS OWN DOMAIN OVERRAN THE COUNTRY DAILY UP TO THE GATES OF IMOLA AGNOLO DELLA PERGOLA
TO WHICH A CITY IS ACCUSTOMED THERE BEING NOTHING SO INJURIOUS TO THE PEOPLE AS SUCH A CHANGE FOR MANY ARE NECESSARILY OFFENDED AND WHERE THERE ARE SEVERAL DISCONTENTED
AND WOULD SOON IF NOT RESTRAINED BY GREATER FORCE OR BETTER REGULATIONS APPOINT THE MAGISTRATES WHO
AND THAT GIOVANNI POSSESSED SEVERAL QUALITIES FAR SURPASSING THOSE OF SALVESTRO THE ASSOCIATES OF NICCOLO WERE UNINFLUENCED BY HIS REMARKS FOR THEY WERE JEALOUS OF HIS REPUTATION AND DESIRED TO EXALT SOME PERSON
THE FLORENTINES MURMUR AGAINST THOSE WHO HAD BEEN ADVOCATES OF THE WAR
IT APPEARED TO HIM THAT SO GREAT MILITARY SUPERIORITY COMBINED WITH SUCH AN EXTENT OF TERRITORY WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO THEMSELVES
IN THE FIRST PLACE HE APPREHENDED THAT THE MILANESE THROUGH THEIR ANGER AGAINST THE COUNT WOULD SURRENDER THEMSELVES ENTIRELY TO THE VENETIANS WHICH WOULD OCCASION THE RUIN OF ALL SUPPOSING HE SHOULD OCCUPY MILAN
HE COULD NOT AVOID FEELING REGRET AND DISPLEASURE SIMILAR TO WHAT THE MILANESE HAD EXPERIENCED WHEN HE ABANDONED THEM HE TOOK TWO DAYS TO CONSIDER THE REPLY HE WOULD MAKE TO THE AMBASSADORS WHOM THE VENETIANS HAD SENT TO INFORM HIM OF THE TREATY AND DURING THIS TIME
AND AS IT WAS IN THEIR POWER TO MAKE PEACE WITH EITHER OF THE TWO THE ONE DESIRING IT FROM AMBITION THE OTHER FROM FEAR
ALAS THOSE WHO GRASP AT ALL CANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH A PART THOU DIDST PROMISE THAT WE SHOULD POSSESS THE CONQUESTS WHICH THOU MIGHT AFTERWARD MAKE
THEY WOULD NOT BE SENSIBLE OF THEIR LOSS OR THE DUKE OF HIS VICTORY HE ASSURED THEM THEY OUGHT NOT TO BE ALARMED BY IMPENDING EXPENSES AND CONSEQUENT TAXATION BECAUSE THE LATTER MIGHT BE REDUCED
RINALDO DEGLI ALBIZZI ADDRESSES AN ASSEMBLY OF CITIZENS AND ADVISES THE RESTORATION OF THE GRANDI
WHO MAY BE REMOVED BY DEATH OR BECOME UNSERVICEABLE BY MISFORTUNE HENCE IT APPEARS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WHICH COMMENCED IN FLORENCE AT THE DEATH OF GIORGIO SCALI IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE
TOOK COURAGE AND DRAINED THEM WITHOUT MERCY
AND ALTHOUGH MOVED BY VARIOUS CAUSES THEY OFTEN ATTACKED THE ROMAN PROVINCES WERE ALWAYS KEPT IN SUBJECTION BY THE IMPERIAL FORCES THE EMPEROR THEODOSIUS CONQUERED THEM WITH GREAT GLORY AND BEING WHOLLY REDUCED TO HIS POWER
THIS AS WILL BE RELATED IN ITS PLACE CAUSED THE ORIGIN OF VENICE
WHICH IS NOT OCCASIONED BY ANY INJURIES YOU HAVE DONE THEM OR BY FEAR ON THEIR PART BUT BY OUR WEAKNESS AND THEIR OWN AMBITION FOR THE ONE GIVES THEM HOPE OF BEING ABLE TO OPPRESS US AND THE OTHER INCITES THEM TO ATTEMPT IT
SHOWED NO LESS FOLLY IN THE PRINCES THEMSELVES THAN INFIDELITY IN THEIR MINISTERS
ATTILA HAVING LEFT ITALY VALENTINIAN EMPEROR OF THE WEST THOUGHT OF RESTORING THE COUNTRY AND THAT HE MIGHT BE MORE READY TO DEFEND IT AGAINST THE BARBARIANS ABANDONED ROME AND REMOVED THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT TO RAVENNA THE MISFORTUNES WHICH BEFELL THE WESTERN EMPIRE
THAT THE SOVEREIGNTY WHICH IS COMMENCED IN DECEIT AND VILLAINY WILL TERMINATE EITHER IN THYSELF OR THY CHILDREN WITH IGNOMINY AND BLOOD THE COUNT THOUGH NOT INSENSIBLE TO THE JUST REPROACHES OF THE MILANESE
WHO WAS SO FAR INFLUENCED BY THE DUKE AS TO TAKE COMMAND UNDER HIM AND QUIT THE COUNT'S SERVICE THIS CIRCUMSTANCE CAUSED THE LATTER TO LAY ASIDE EVERY IDEA BUT THAT OF HIS OWN SAFETY AND TO COME TO AGREEMENT WITH THE DUKE
MIGHT DESPAIR OF ASSISTANCE AND BE COMPELLED TO SUBMISSION BY FAMINE THE FORTRESS WAS VERY STRONG AND DEFENDED BY A NUMEROUS GARRISON SO THAT ITS CAPTURE WOULD BE BY NO MEANS AN EASY UNDERTAKING
WAR DECLARED THE FLORENTINES ARE ROUTED BY THE DUCAL FORCES REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENTS MORE ESPECIALLY THOSE IMPERFECTLY ORGANIZED FREQUENTLY CHANGE THEIR RULERS AND THE FORM OF THEIR INSTITUTIONS
AND HE HAD BESIDES ENTERED INTO ANOTHER TREATY WITH THE LEGATE OF BOLOGNA
THE ANCIENT SEAT OF THEIR DOMINION AND FIXED THEIR RESIDENCE AT CONSTANTINOPLE FOR BY THIS STEP THEY EXPOSED THE WESTERN EMPIRE
HE ALSO RAVAGED MANY OTHER PLACES IN ITALY AND THEN LOADED WITH WEALTH WITHDREW TO AFRICA THE ROMANS HAVING RETURNED TO THEIR CITY AND MAXIMUS BEING DEAD
THE COUNT'S SUCCESSES THE VENETIANS COME TO TERMS WITH HIM VIEWS OF THE VENETIANS
AND BEING COME WE COULD NOT PREVENT THEIR AGGRESSIONS YOU KNOW THAT WITHOUT THE AID OF SOME POWERFUL ALLY WE ARE INCAPABLE OF SELF DEFENSE AND THAT NONE CAN RENDER US THIS SERVICE MORE POWERFULLY OR FAITHFULLY THAN THE DUKE
STILL THIS WANT OF CAUTION IN US DOES NOT EXCUSE THE PERFIDY IN THEE NOR CAN IT OBLITERATE THE INFAMY WITH WHICH OUR JUST COMPLAINTS WILL BLACKEN THY CHARACTER THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
MANY OTHERS WHETHER ENVIOUS OF THOSE IN POWER OR FEARING A RUPTURE WITH THE DUKE CONSIDERED IT UNADVISABLE SO LIGHTLY TO ENTERTAIN SUSPICIONS OF AN ALLY
BUT FOR OUR SIMPLICITY WE RECEIVED THEE TO OUR HOME ACTUATED BY REVERENCE FOR THE HAPPY MEMORY OF OUR DUKE WITH WHOM BEING CONNECTED BY MARRIAGE AND RENEWED ALLIANCE WE BELIEVED THY AFFECTION WOULD DESCEND TO THOSE WHO HAD INHERITED HIS AUTHORITY
FROM THE POWERFUL ENEMIES WHICH EACH CONDITION CREATES ITSELF THEY NEITHER HAVE NOR CAN POSSESS ANY STABILITY FOR TYRANNY CANNOT PLEASE THE GOOD AND LICENSE IS OFFENSIVE TO THE WISE
BUT IF THEY WERE TO STRIKE THE FIRST BLOW AT THE DUKE PUBLIC OPINION WOULD BE AS FAVORABLE TO HIM AS TO THEMSELVES AND BESIDES THEY COULD NOT SO CONFIDENTLY DEMAND ASSISTANCE AS ASSAILANTS
AND ALL BEING ANXIOUS THAT THE ENEMY SHOULD NOT OBTAIN THE EXPECTED ADVANTAGE THEY ENABLED HIM TO SECURE A GREATER FOR HAVING ABANDONED THE SIEGE OF FURLI TO GO TO THE RELIEF OF ZAGONARA
A COURSE WHICH DIMINISHED HIS OWN POWER AND INCREASED THAT OF THE BARBARIANS NOR WAS THE ISLAND OF BRITAIN WHICH IS NOW CALLED ENGLAND SECURE FROM THEM FOR THE BRITONS BEING APPREHENSIVE OF THOSE WHO HAD OCCUPIED GAUL CALLED THE ANGLI
THAT NOW THE SAME REMEDY COULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED WITHOUT INCURRING THE DANGER OF GREATER EVILS AND THEREFORE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT FOR THEM TO DO
HE WOULD GAIN FEW FRIENDS AND MAKE MANY ENEMIES
SENT THEM ONE THOUSAND FOOT AND TWO THOUSAND HORSE BY WHOSE AID THE VENETIANS WERE IN A CONDITION TO TREAT FOR PEACE AT ONE TIME IT SEEMED THE FATE OF THEIR REPUBLIC TO LOSE BY WAR AND WIN BY NEGOTIATION FOR WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM THEM IN BATTLE WAS FREQUENTLY RESTORED TWOFOLD ON THE RESTORATION OF PEACE
WITH COMPLAINTS AND ALL CONDEMNED
WHICH HAD BEEN COMMENCED LONG AGO AS TO ENABLE THEM TO PERFORM DIVINE SERVICE IN IT REQUESTED HIS HOLINESS TO CONSECRATE IT TO THIS THE PONTIFF WILLINGLY AGREED AND THE FLORENTINES TO EXHIBIT THE WEALTH OF THE CITY AND THE SPLENDOR OF THE EDIFICE AND DO GREATER HONOR TO THE POPE
AND AMONG THE REST GIOVANNI DE MEDICI WHO PUBLICLY ENDEAVORED TO SHOW
NEITHER DID THEY THINK HE WOULD BE CONTENT WITH THE BOUNDARIES ASSIGNED HIM BY THE TREATY
THE GOVERNMENT OF PISA FOR ONE YEAR THERE WERE AT THAT TIME CERTAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ROMAN AND THE GREEK CHURCHES WHICH PREVENTED PERFECT CONFORMITY IN DIVINE SERVICE AND AT THE LAST COUNCIL OF BALE
AND AFTER THE DEATHS OF MANY EMPERORS THE EMPIRE OF CONSTANTINOPLE DEVOLVED UPON ZENO AND THAT OF ROME UPON ORESTES AND AUGUSTULUS HIS SON WHO OBTAINED THE SOVEREIGNTY BY FRAUD WHILE THEY WERE DESIGNING TO HOLD BY FORCE WHAT THEY HAD OBTAINED BY TREACHERY
AND HIS ADVICE WAS APPROVED OF BY THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY
BUT WHAT GAVE EVERY ONE GREATER ALARM AND OFFERED SUFFICIENT OCCASION FOR THE DECLARATION OF WAR WAS THE EXPEDITION MADE BY THE DUKE AGAINST FURLI
BY MEANS OF WHOM HE MIGHT BE HUMBLED THIS WAS THE STATE OF FLORENCE IN WHICH OPPOSING FEELINGS BEGAN TO BE OBSERVABLE WHEN FILIPPO VISCONTI
INTO A NET HE CARRIED AT HIS SIDE BUT WE COULDN'T STOP WE HAD TO FOLLOW THE CAPTAIN
BUT IT WOULD BE LESS WORK TO BELIEVE ME BESIDES FRENCHMEN ENGLISHMEN AMERICANS DANES AND NORWEGIANS CATCH THESE COD BY THE THOUSANDS THEY'RE EATEN IN PRODIGIOUS QUANTITIES AND WITHOUT
NONE OF THE WEEDS CARPETING THE SEAFLOOR NONE OF THE BRANCHES BRISTLING FROM THE SHRUBBERY CREPT OR LEANED OR STRETCHED ON A HORIZONTAL PLANE THEY ALL ROSE RIGHT UP TOWARD THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
THAN TO VISIT ONE OF THESE PETRIFIED FORESTS THAT NATURE HAS PLANTED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA WE TURNED ON OUR RUHMKORFF DEVICES AND WENT ALONG A CORAL SHOAL IN THE PROCESS OF FORMING WHICH GIVEN TIME WILL SOMEDAY CLOSE OFF THIS WHOLE PART OF THE INDIAN OCEAN
AND I WAS DETERMINED TO KEEP ON MY GUARD MEANWHILE I HAD ASSUMED THIS REST PERIOD WOULD BE THE TURNING POINT IN OUR STROLL BUT I WAS MISTAKEN AND INSTEAD OF HEADING BACK TO THE NAUTILUS CAPTAIN NEMO CONTINUED HIS DARING EXCURSION
BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SHIPS IN THE GALLANT AMERICAN NAVY BUT THEY ATTACKED ME AND I HAD TO DEFEND MYSELF ALL THE SAME I WAS CONTENT SIMPLY TO PUT THE FRIGATE IN A CONDITION WHERE IT COULD DO ME NO HARM
TURBO SNAILS GIANT CLAMS AND SALTWATER SCALLOPS BRIEFLY ALL THOSE THAT SECRETE MOTHER OF PEARL IN OTHER WORDS THAT BLUE AZURE VIOLET OR WHITE SUBSTANCE
THIS MYSTERY PUZZLED ME FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM ANY VIEWS I DRIFTED FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER SOMETHING WAS OUT THERE THAT MUCH WAS CERTAIN AND ANY DOUBTING THOMAS WAS INVITED TO PLACE HIS FINGER ON THE SCOTIA'S WOUND WHEN I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK
HERE UNDER THESE CLEAR WAVES THIS CRAB RACED AROUND WITH MATCHLESS AGILITY WHILE GREEN TURTLES FROM THE SPECIES FREQUENTING THE MALABAR COAST MOVED SLUGGISHLY AMONG THE CRUMBLING ROCKS
AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THE ELECTRIC LIGHTS CAME BACK ON I WENT INTO THE LOUNGE IT WAS DESERTED I CONSULTED THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS THE NAUTILUS WAS FLEEING NORTHWARD AT A SPEED OF TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR
WHITE GOBIES FROM THE GENUS ELEOTRIS WITH CURVED CAUDAL FINS AND VIOLET SPOTS ON THE BACK WONDERFUL JAPANESE MACKEREL FROM THE GENUS SCOMBER WITH BLUE BODIES AND SILVER HEADS GLITTERING AZURE GOLDFISH
I ADMIT THAT MY HEART WAS POUNDING LORD KNOWS WHY BUT I SAW A DEFINITE CONNECTION BETWEEN THIS SICK CREWMAN AND YESTERDAY'S HAPPENINGS
HOW MANY SHIPS HAVE PERISHED IN THESE WATERWAYS AS THEY TRIED TO GET DIRECTIONS FROM THE HAZY LIGHTS ON THE COAST HOW MANY CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THESE OPAQUE MISTS HOW MANY COLLISIONS HAVE OCCURRED WITH THESE REEFS
COME ON CONSEIL I TOLD HIM HERE'S YOUR LAST CHANCE TO POCKET THAT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IF MASTER WILL PERMIT MY SAYING SO CONSEIL REPLIED I NEVER EXPECTED TO WIN THAT PRIZE
HOW UNUSUAL THE CANADIAN PUT IN SETTING ASIDE HIS TANTRUMS AND GETAWAY SCHEMES WHILE SUBMITTING TO THIS IRRESISTIBLE ALLURE A MAN WOULD GO AN EVEN GREATER DISTANCE JUST TO STARE AT SUCH A SIGHT
I HAD SEEN TO THAT DAY WE ALSO GATHERED IN A FEW SEA CUCUMBERS SOME PEARL OYSTERS AND A DOZEN SMALL TURTLES THAT WE SAVED FOR THE SHIP'S PANTRY BUT JUST WHEN I LEAST EXPECTED IT I LAID MY HANDS ON A WONDER A NATURAL DEFORMITY I'D HAVE TO CALL IT
WE HAD LEFT THE ALLURING SOCIETY ISLANDS IN THE WEST LIKEWISE ELEGANT TAHITI QUEEN OF THE PACIFIC IN THE MORNING I SPOTTED THIS ISLAND'S LOFTY SUMMITS A FEW MILES TO LEEWARD ITS WATERS SUPPLIED EXCELLENT FISH FOR THE TABLES ON BOARD
I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM AND FROM THERE MY EYES EAGERLY SCANNED THE HORIZON IN THE NORTHEAST THERE EMERGED TWO VOLCANIC ISLANDS OF UNEQUAL SIZE SURROUNDED BY A CORAL REEF WHOSE CIRCUIT MEASURED FORTY MILES WE WERE FACING THE ISLAND OF VANIKORO PROPER
BECAUSE OUR HATCHES STAYED OPEN OFFERING EASY ACCESS TO THE NAUTILUS'S INTERIOR AT SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING JANUARY EIGHTH I CLIMBED ONTO THE PLATFORM THE MORNING SHADOWS WERE LIFTING THE ISLAND WAS SOON ON VIEW
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY FEMALE EAR THAT COULD HANDLE IT OUR VISIT TO THIS OPULENT GIANT CLAM CAME TO AN END
THIS ORDER INCLUDES ONLY ONE FAMILY EXAMPLES SEAHORSES AND DRAGONFISH BAD VERY BAD THE HARPOONER REPLIED SEXTO AND LAST CONSEIL SAID
WHEN I ARRIVED ON THE PLATFORM THAT MORNING
CERTAINLY I REPLIED EVASIVELY BUT AFTER WE MAKE A DETOUR WHATEVER DETOUR MASTER WISHES OH IT'S NOTHING REALLY A ROUTE SLIGHTLY LESS DIRECT THAT'S ALL WE'RE LEAVING ON THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN
AND FINALLY FOR NATURALISTS IT'S A SIMPLE FESTERING SECRETION FROM THE ORGAN THAT PRODUCES MOTHER OF PEARL IN CERTAIN BIVALVES BRANCH MOLLUSCA CONSEIL SAID CLASS
UNDULATING TRIGGERFISH ENCIRCLED BY LITTLE RED BANDS BLOATED PUFFERS WHOSE VENOM IS EXTREMELY INSIDIOUS
WELL VERSED IN THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION HE WAS POORLY VERSED IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND I DOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A SPERM WHALE FROM A BALEEN WHALE AND YET WHAT A FINE GALLANT LAD
NOW THEN IT WAS PRECISELY THIS FAMILIARITY THAT WE NEEDED TO PREVENT SINCE OUR WEAPONS MADE NO SOUND WHEN THEY WENT OFF THEY WOULD HAVE ONLY A MODERATE EFFECT ON THESE ISLANDERS WHO REPUTEDLY RESPECT
KEEPING TO ITS NORTHERLY HEADING IT FOLLOWED THE LONG WINDINGS OF SOUTH AMERICA BY THEN WE HAD FARED SIXTEEN THOUSAND LEAGUES SINCE COMING ON BOARD IN THE SEAS OF JAPAN
ALTHOUGH THE SUMMER SUN LAVISHED ITS RAYS ON US WE NEVER SUFFERED FROM THE HEAT BECAUSE THIRTY OR FORTY METERS UNDERWATER THE TEMPERATURE DIDN'T GO OVER TEN DEGREES TO TWELVE DEGREES CENTIGRADE BY DECEMBER FIFTEENTH
ENOUGH ENOUGH WAS IT A VOW OF REPENTANCE THAT HAD JUST ESCAPED FROM THIS MAN'S CONSCIENCE FRANTIC I RUSHED INTO THE LIBRARY
ROOSTING IN THE SHROUDS THE CREW EXAMINED THE HORIZON WHICH SHRANK AND DARKENED LITTLE BY LITTLE OFFICERS WERE PROBING THE INCREASING GLOOM WITH THEIR NIGHT GLASSES SOMETIMES THE MURKY OCEAN SPARKLED BENEATH MOONBEAMS THAT DARTED BETWEEN THE FRINGES OF TWO CLOUDS
HE RAN OFF HOWLING IN TERROR AND WILDLY PRANCING AROUND TEN OF HIS COMPANIONS FOLLOWED HIM ALL TEN MET THE SAME FATE CONSEIL WAS IN ECSTASY CARRIED AWAY BY HIS VIOLENT INSTINCTS
WHOSE ORIGIN I COULDN'T EVEN GUESS SO I HAD TO GIVE UP ANY NOTIONS OF QUESTIONING THEM THE NETS WERE HAULED ON BOARD
MOQUIN TANDON AND OTHERS THAT'S RIGHT I SAID I AM A DOCTOR I USED TO BE ON CALL AT THE HOSPITALS I WAS IN PRACTICE FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE JOINING THE MUSEUM EXCELLENT SIR
CAPTAIN NEMO CAME TO TAKE THE ALTITUDE OF THE SUN THE SEA WAS SMOOTH THE SKIES CLEAR EIGHT MILES TO THE EAST A BIG STEAMSHIP WAS VISIBLE ON THE HORIZON LINE NO FLAG
SOME OF THESE JELLYFISH WERE SHAPED LIKE VERY SMOOTH SEMISPHERIC PARASOLS WITH RUSSET STRIPES AND FRINGES OF TWELVE NEAT FESTOONS OTHERS LOOKED LIKE
WHICH WHEN CONDENSING WOULD SUBMERGE THE TEMPERATE ZONES SALTS PLAY A LEADING ROLE THE ROLE OF STABILIZER FOR THE GENERAL ECOLOGY OF THE GLOBE CAPTAIN NEMO STOPPED
WHY YES CERTAINLY OF COURSE I CAN SEE THAT YOU LIKE THE IDEA MISTER LAND YES IT WILL BE A REALLY UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS I ADDED IN AN INSINUATING TONE
AND I HAD STARTED TO STRETCH MY LIMBS WHEN AN UNEXPECTED APPARITION BROUGHT ME SHARPLY TO MY FEET A FEW PACES AWAY A MONSTROUS METER HIGH SEA SPIDER WAS STARING AT ME WITH BEADY EYES
I KNOW THAT SOME DIVERS CAN LAST UP TO FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS AND HIGHLY SKILLFUL ONES TO EIGHTY SEVEN BUT SUCH MEN ARE RARE
AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY NINE METERS
LEANED ON MY ELBOWS BEFORE THE WINDOW AND I SAW IT IN THE BROAD ELECTRIC DAYLIGHT
SHADOWS GATHERED AND GLOOM OVERRAN THE SEA UNTIL THE MOON CAME UP I REPAIRED TO MY STATEROOM I COULDN'T SLEEP I WAS ASSAULTED BY NIGHTMARES THAT HORRIBLE SCENE OF DESTRUCTION KEPT REPEATING IN MY MIND'S EYE
THE THREE OF US FOLLOWED HIM AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER MIRACULOUSLY SAFE WE REACHED THE FISHERMAN'S LONGBOAT CAPTAIN NEMO'S FIRST CONCERN WAS TO REVIVE THIS UNFORTUNATE MAN I WASN'T SURE HE WOULD SUCCEED
BECAUSE JULY IN THIS ZONE CORRESPONDS TO OUR JANUARY IN EUROPE BUT THE SEA REMAINED SMOOTH AND EASILY VISIBLE OVER A VAST PERIMETER NED LAND STILL KEPT UP THE MOST TENACIOUS SKEPTICISM
OR PER EVERY THIRTY FEET OF DEPTH
WELL HOW ABOUT YOU CONSEIL WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT THESE MAN EATERS ME CONSEIL SAID I'M AFRAID I MUST BE FRANK WITH MASTER GOOD FOR YOU I THOUGHT
HIS SLOOPS OF WAR THE ZEALOUS AND THE NEW ASTROLABE WELLNIGH PERISHED BUT MY NAUTILUS IS IN NO DANGER TOMORROW ON THE DAY STATED AND AT THE HOUR STATED THE TIDE WILL PEACEFULLY LIFT IT OFF AND IT WILL RESUME ITS NAVIGATING THROUGH THE SEAS
THE GULF OF OB THE LYAKHOV ISLANDS OR THOSE UNKNOWN BEACHES ON THE SIBERIAN COAST I'M UNABLE TO SAY I LOST TRACK OF THE PASSING HOURS TIME WAS IN ABEYANCE ON THE SHIP'S CLOCKS
IT WAS NOW THE TWENTY SIXTH WE HAD LIVED OFF THE SHIP'S STORES FOR FIVE DAYS AND ALL REMAINING BREATHABLE AIR HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN EVEN TODAY AS I WRITE THESE LINES MY SENSATIONS ARE SO INTENSE
A TORTURE UNDREAMED OF BY EVEN THE WILDEST SAVAGES I FELT LIKE I WAS LYING IN THE JAWS OF A FEARSOME MONSTER JAWS IRRESISTIBLY CLOSING SUPERVISING OUR WORK
A SHIP I EXCLAIMED YES THE CANADIAN REPLIED A DISABLED CRAFT THAT'S SINKING STRAIGHT DOWN NED LAND WAS NOT MISTAKEN WE WERE IN THE PRESENCE OF A SHIP
MY MUSCLES HAD NO POWER TO CONTRACT I'M UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE HOURS THAT PASSED IN THIS WAY BUT I WAS AWARE THAT MY DEATH THROES HAD BEGUN I REALIZED THAT I WAS ABOUT TO DIE SUDDENLY I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
OF A CORK FLOAT THE NAUTILUS HAD TO MANEUVER SHREWDLY IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNDERWATER SPIDERWEB BUT THE SHIP DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THESE HEAVILY TRAVELED WATERWAYS IT WENT UP TO ABOUT LATITUDE FORTY TWO DEGREES
NOT WRINKLED LIKE BEACH SAND WHICH PRESERVES THE IMPRESSIONS LEFT BY THE WAVES THIS DAZZLING CARPET WAS A REAL MIRROR THROWING BACK THE SUN'S RAYS WITH STARTLING INTENSITY THE OUTCOME
SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CUBIC METERS TO DIG A HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE SHIP COULD DESCEND BELOW THIS TRACT OF ICE WORK BEGAN IMMEDIATELY AND WAS CARRIED ON WITH TIRELESS TENACITY INSTEAD OF DIGGING ALL AROUND THE NAUTILUS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENTAILED EVEN GREATER DIFFICULTIES
I LOOKED TO PORT AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE IMMENSENESS OF THESE TRANQUIL WATERS TO STARBOARD A PROMINENT BULGE ON THE SEA BOTTOM CAUGHT MY ATTENTION YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
NOT EVEN A TWENTY FOUR HOUR BREATHER WAS GRANTED TO COMMANDER FARRAGUT HIS PROVISIONS WERE LOADED ON BOARD HIS COAL BUNKERS WERE OVERFLOWING NOT A CREWMAN WAS MISSING FROM HIS POST TO CAST OFF HE NEEDED ONLY TO FIRE AND STOKE HIS FURNACES HALF A DAY'S DELAY WOULD HAVE BEEN UNFORGIVABLE
I EMPTY ALL THE BALLAST TANKS COMPLETELY THIS LOGIC BACKED UP BY FIGURES LEFT ME WITHOUT A SINGLE OBJECTION
THAT SUCH PRIMITIVE METHODS ARE STILL ALL THAT THEY USE ALL
AT TWO THIRTY FIVE CAPTAIN NEMO APPEARED IN THE LOUNGE WE'RE ABOUT TO DEPART HE SAID AH I PUT IN I'VE GIVEN ORDERS TO OPEN THE HATCHES WHAT ABOUT THE PAPUANS
I COULD MAKE OUT HER FEATURES WHICH THE WATER HADN'T YET DECOMPOSED WITH A SUPREME EFFORT
HE SAID YOU'D ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS LITTLE STROLL INDEED I SAID BUT DIDN'T HE GIVE YOU ANY DETAILS ON NOT A ONE MISTER NATURALIST YOU WILL BE GOING WITH US RIGHT ME
ALTHOUGH THESE FISHERIES BELONG TO THE MOST INDUSTRIALIZED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE ENGLISH
FOR A FARE OF TWENTY FRANCS THE VEHICLE WENT DOWN BROADWAY TO UNION SQUARE
ALL RIGHT CONSEIL MY FRIEND THE HARPOONER SAID LEANING TOWARD THE GLASS PANEL
WHICH CAN SPEND LONG HOURS EITHER AT SEA OR ON SHORE TRAVELING THROUGH THEIR DOUBLE DOMAIN AS THEIR WHIMS DICTATE MEANWHILE CAPTAIN NEMO HAD CALLED A HALT MY COMPANIONS AND I STOPPED WALKING
NECKS AND EARS THAT'S OBLONG IN SHAPE GLASSY IN LUSTER AND FORMED FROM MOTHER OF PEARL FOR CHEMISTS IT'S A MIXTURE OF CALCIUM PHOSPHATE AND CALCIUM CARBONATE WITH A LITTLE GELATIN PROTEIN
WITH HIS EVERY MOVEMENT I IMAGINED HE WOULD APPEAR AND ASK ME WHY I WANTED TO ESCAPE I FELT IN A PERPETUAL STATE OF ALARM MY IMAGINATION MAGNIFIED THIS SENSATION THE FEELING BECAME SO ACUTE
UNUSUAL MOLLUSKS THAT ARE NEAR NEIGHBORS OF THE CUTTLEFISH FRENCH FISHERMEN GIVE THEM THE NAME CUCKOLDFISH AND THEY BELONG TO THE CLASS CEPHALOPODA FAMILY DIBRANCHIATA CONSISTING OF THEMSELVES TOGETHER WITH CUTTLEFISH AND ARGONAUTS
MERCY LOOK AT THESE COD HE SAID WHY I THOUGHT COD WERE FLAT LIKE DAB OR SOLE
AND SPREAD OUT ON DISPLAY BUT IN THE WATER THEY'RE LIKE MULLET SPINDLE SHAPED AND PERFECTLY BUILT FOR SPEED I CAN EASILY BELIEVE MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED BUT WHAT CROWDS OF THEM WHAT SWARMS
I STARED WILD EYED I SAW THE FIGHT ENTER A NEW PHASE THE CAPTAIN FELL TO THE SEAFLOOR TOPPLED BY THE ENORMOUS MASS WEIGHING HIM DOWN THEN THE SHARK'S JAWS OPENED ASTOUNDINGLY WIDE LIKE A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL SHEARS
COULD COME TO OUR RESCUE DON'T YOU SEE THAT BY SOLIDIFYING IT COULD BURST THESE TRACTS OF ICE IMPRISONING US JUST AS ITS FREEZING CAN BURST THE HARDEST STONES AREN'T YOU AWARE THAT THIS FORCE COULD BE THE INSTRUMENT OF OUR SALVATION RATHER THAN OUR DESTRUCTION
IN A FEW MINUTES THE WATER REACHED ONE HUNDRED DEGREES CENTIGRADE IT WAS SENT TO THE PUMPS WHILE NEW WATER REPLACED IT IN THE PROCESS THE HEAT GENERATED BY OUR BATTERIES WAS SO INTENSE THAT AFTER SIMPLY GOING THROUGH THE MECHANISM WATER DRAWN COLD FROM THE SEA ARRIVED
MY REPLY OBVIOUSLY PLEASED CAPTAIN NEMO BUT NOT KNOWING WHAT HE WAS DRIVING AT I WAITED FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS
THESE SEAMEN OBVIOUSLY BELONGED TO DIFFERENT NATIONALITIES ALTHOUGH INDICATIONS OF EUROPEAN PHYSICAL TRAITS COULD BE SEEN IN THEM ALL IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN I RECOGNIZED SOME IRISHMEN SOME FRENCHMEN
I CLIMBED THE CENTRAL COMPANIONWAY AND GOING ALONG THE UPPER GANGWAY I ARRIVED AT THE SKIFF I WENT THROUGH THE OPENING THAT HAD ALREADY GIVEN ACCESS TO MY TWO COMPANIONS LET'S GO LET'S GO I EXCLAIMED
THE SEAFLOOR KEPT SINKING AND ITS SIGNIFICANTLY STEEPER SLOPE TOOK US TO GREATER DEPTHS IT MUST HAVE BEEN NEARLY THREE O'CLOCK WHEN WE REACHED A NARROW VALLEY GOUGED BETWEEN HIGH VERTICAL WALLS
THEN CUT THE TROPIC OF CANCER AT LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO DEGREES AND HEADED FOR THE SEAS OF CHINA WE WERE FINALLY IN THE AREA OF THE MONSTER'S LATEST ANTICS AND IN ALL HONESTY SHIPBOARD CONDITIONS BECAME LIFE THREATENING HEARTS WERE POUNDING HIDEOUSLY
CHIEF MEMBER OF THIS ISLAND GROUP THAT BELONGS TO FRANCE
I COULD SEE PERFECTLY THOSE LONG FISHING LINES EACH ARMED WITH TWO HUNDRED HOOKS THAT EVERY BOAT DANGLED BY THE DOZENS THE LOWER END OF EACH LINE DRAGGED THE BOTTOM BY MEANS OF A SMALL GRAPPLING IRON
OUR PATH WAS BORDERED BY HOPELESSLY TANGLED BUSHES FORMED FROM SNARLS OF SHRUBS ALL COVERED WITH LITTLE STAR SHAPED WHITE STREAKED FLOWERS ONLY CONTRARY TO PLANTS ON SHORE THESE TREE FORMS BECOME ATTACHED TO ROCKS ON THE SEAFLOOR BY HEADING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
A SECOND WELL POLISHED STONE REMOVED A TASTY RINGDOVE LEG FROM CONSEIL'S HAND GIVING STILL GREATER RELEVANCE TO HIS OBSERVATION WE ALL THREE STOOD UP RIFLES TO OUR SHOULDERS READY TO ANSWER ANY ATTACK
THEY DON'T STRIKE ME AS VERY WICKED THEY'RE CANNIBALS EVEN SO MY BOY A PERSON CAN BE BOTH A CANNIBAL AND A DECENT MAN CONSEIL REPLIED JUST AS A PERSON CAN BE BOTH GLUTTONOUS AND HONORABLE THE ONE DOESN'T EXCLUDE THE OTHER
RIGHT AWAY THE CANADIAN REPLIED FIRST NED LAND CLOSED AND BOLTED THE OPENING CUT INTO THE NAUTILUS'S SHEET IRON USING THE MONKEY WRENCH HE HAD WITH HIM
A SORRY SIGHT THIS CARCASS LOST UNDER THE WAVES
NED LAND LEAPED UP THE COMPANIONWAY BUT AS SOON AS HIS HANDS SEIZED THE RAILING HE WAS THROWN BACKWARD IN HIS TURN DAMNATION HE EXCLAIMED I'VE BEEN STRUCK BY A LIGHTNING BOLT
REGULARLY FIXED THE POSITIONS I FOUND REPORTED ON THE CHART
CARRIED AWAY BY CURIOSITY I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND TO TAKE IT WEIGH IT FONDLE IT BUT THE CAPTAIN STOPPED ME SIGNALED NO REMOVED HIS DAGGER IN ONE SWIFT MOTION
DULL GLASSY STARES AND PHOSPHORESCENT MATTER OOZING FROM HOLES AROUND THEIR SNOUTS THEY WERE LIKE MONSTROUS FIREFLIES THAT COULD THOROUGHLY PULVERIZE A MAN IN THEIR IRON JAWS
THOSE TROPICAL CREEPERS OF THE SEA ALL DECKED OUT IN SHADES AND GLEAMS WE PASSED FREELY UNDER THEIR LOFTY BOUGHS LOST UP IN THE SHADOWS OF THE WAVES WHILE AT OUR FEET ORGAN PIPE CORAL STONY CORAL STAR CORAL FUNGUS CORAL
BUT TWO OR MORE EVENTS AT TWO OR MORE TIMES AND A BURNT CHILD FEARS THE FIRE THAT IS TO SAY THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF FIRE HAS A DIFFERENT EFFECT UPON A CHILD WHICH HAS HAD THE SENSATIONS OF BURNING THAN UPON ONE WHICH HAS NOT
THE SORT OF RELATION WHICH WE MIGHT CALL AWARENESS IN THAT CASE THE SENSATION AS A MENTAL EVENT WILL CONSIST OF AWARENESS OF THE COLOUR WHILE THE COLOUR ITSELF WILL REMAIN WHOLLY PHYSICAL AND MAY BE CALLED THE SENSE DATUM TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE SENSATION
STILL NO MORE THAN A ROUGH GENERALIZATION A STATISTICAL AVERAGE IT CANNOT TELL US WHAT WILL RESULT FROM A GIVEN CAUSE ON A GIVEN OCCASION IT IS A LAW OF TENDENCY
THIS SUBJECT MATTER THEREFORE WE ASSIGNED EXCLUSIVELY TO PSYCHOLOGY BUT WE FOUND NO WAY OF DEFINING IMAGES EXCEPT THROUGH THEIR CAUSATION
BUT THE MATTER IS AFTER ALL INFERRED FROM ITS APPEARANCES WHICH ARE USED TO VERIFY PHYSICAL LAWS THUS IN SO FAR AS PHYSICS IS AN EMPIRICAL AND VERIFIABLE SCIENCE
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN IMAGES AND SENSATIONS MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT BY NO MEANS DIFFICULT WHEN WE SHUT OUR EYES AND CALL UP PICTURES OF FAMILIAR SCENES WE USUALLY HAVE NO DIFFICULTY SO LONG AS WE REMAIN AWAKE IN DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN WHAT WE ARE IMAGINING AND WHAT IS REALLY SEEN
AT THE END OF OUR JOURNEY IT IS TIME TO RETURN TO THE QUESTION FROM WHICH WE SET OUT NAMELY WHAT IS IT THAT CHARACTERIZES MIND AS OPPOSED TO MATTER OR TO STATE THE SAME QUESTION IN OTHER TERMS HOW IS PSYCHOLOGY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM PHYSICS
YOU WILL SEEM TO HAVE GROWN PARTIALLY DEAF AND YOU WILL FIND IT NECESSARY TO BE MUCH NEARER THE STAGE THAN YOU WOULD NEED TO BE IN YOUR OWN COUNTRY
THOSE THAT HAVE PHYSICAL CAUSES AND MENTAL EFFECTS WE SHOULD DEFINE AS SENSATIONS THOSE THAT HAVE MENTAL CAUSES AND PHYSICAL EFFECTS MIGHT PERHAPS BE IDENTIFIED WITH WHAT WE CALL VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS BUT THEY DO NOT CONCERN US AT PRESENT
MERELY BY THE HELP OF NEW ASSOCIATIONS THIS THEORY SO FAR AS I CAN SEE
WE DO NOT THINK THAT IT HAS THE SAME POWER OF PRODUCING KNOWLEDGE OF THE EXTERNAL WORLD IMAGES ARE IMAGINARY IN SOME SENSE THEY ARE UNREAL
BECAUSE WHEN WE FALSELY BELIEVE AN IMAGE TO BE A SENSATION AS IN THE CASE OF DREAMS IT FEELS JUST AS REAL AS IF IT WERE A SENSATION OUR FEELING OF UNREALITY RESULTS FROM OUR HAVING ALREADY REALIZED THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH AN IMAGE
THAT IS TO SAY THEY GROUP TOGETHER PARTICULARS HAVING THE SAME ACTIVE PLACE WHILE PSYCHOLOGY GROUPS TOGETHER THOSE HAVING THE SAME PASSIVE PLACE
THERE ARE NO SUCH EFFECTS AS WOULD ENSUE IF THE THINGS WERE WHAT WE CALL REAL HE TAKES THE CASE OF IMAGINING A FIRE
THEIR PRIVACY NEED FORM NO BAR TO THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THEM ANY MORE THAN THE PRIVACY OF BODILY SENSATIONS DOES BODILY SENSATIONS ARE ADMITTED BY EVEN THE MOST SEVERE CRITICS OF INTROSPECTION ALTHOUGH LIKE IMAGES THEY CAN ONLY BE OBSERVED BY ONE OBSERVER
THERE REMAINS HOWEVER AN IMPORTANT QUESTION
IN CONSIDERING THE CAUSAL LAWS OF PSYCHOLOGY THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN ROUGH GENERALIZATIONS AND EXACT LAWS IS IMPORTANT THERE ARE MANY ROUGH GENERALIZATIONS IN PSYCHOLOGY NOT ONLY OF THE SORT BY WHICH WE GOVERN OUR ORDINARY BEHAVIOUR TO EACH OTHER
THE PATCH OF COLOUR IS ONE THING AND OUR SEEING OF IT IS ANOTHER THIS VIEW HOWEVER DEMANDS THE ADMISSION OF THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN THE SENSE DISCUSSED IN OUR FIRST LECTURE IF THERE IS A SUBJECT IT CAN HAVE A RELATION TO THE PATCH OF COLOUR NAMELY
I SHUT MY EYES AND CALL UP A VISUAL IMAGE OF A FRIEND SITTING IN THE ARM CHAIR IF I THRUST MY IMAGE INTO THE WORLD OF PHYSICS IT CONTRADICTS ALL THE USUAL PHYSICAL LAWS MY FRIEND REACHED THE CHAIR WITHOUT COMING IN AT THE DOOR IN THE USUAL WAY
IN EITHER CASE YOU THINK YOU MISS NOTHING
ASSOCIATION WORKS ONLY FROM EARLIER TO LATER WHILE IN VISUAL AND AUDITORY MEMORY THIS IS NOT THE CASE BUT THE LATER OF TWO NEIGHBOURING EXPERIENCES MAY RECALL THE EARLIER AS WELL AS THE EARLIER THE LATER
IT IS FOR THE SAKE OF THE PROOF THAT IT IS NOT FUNDAMENTAL THAT WE MUST NOW ENDEAVOUR TO DECIDE WHAT IT IS CONSCIOUSNESS BY THOSE WHO REGARD IT AS FUNDAMENTAL
THERE IS SOME DIFFICULTY IN CONNECTING THIS EPISTEMOLOGICAL DEFINITION OF DATA WITH OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE BUT UNTIL SUCH A CONNECTION HAS BEEN EFFECTED WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO USE THE CONCEPTION DATA
WOULD BE THE MOVEMENTS WE ARE SAID TO BE IMAGINING WHETHER THIS IS THE CASE OR NOT MIGHT EVEN BE DECIDED EXPERIMENTALLY IF THERE WERE A DELICATE INSTRUMENT FOR RECORDING SMALL MOVEMENTS IN THE MOUTH AND THROAT
AND THROUGH THE CORRELATIONS WHICH TURN SENSATIONS INTO PERCEPTIONS ENOUGH HAS I HOPE BEEN SAID TO SHOW THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS FAR TOO COMPLEX AND ACCIDENTAL TO BE TAKEN AS THE FUNDAMENTAL CHARACTERISTIC OF MIND
IT IS GOVERNED BY HABIT AND PAST EXPERIENCE IF YOU LISTEN TO A MAN PLAYING THE PIANOLA WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM YOU WILL HAVE IMAGES OF HIS HANDS ON THE KEYS AS IF HE WERE PLAYING THE PIANO
LET THEM THE REALISTS
THEREFORE IN OUR SENSATIONAL LIFE WE ARE IN CAUSAL DEPENDENCE UPON PHYSICAL LAWS THIS HOWEVER IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT OR INTERESTING PART OF OUR QUESTION IT IS THE CAUSATION OF IMAGES THAT IS THE VITAL PROBLEM
THE ANSWER PROVISIONALLY SUGGESTED AT THE OUTSET OF OUR INQUIRY WAS THAT PSYCHOLOGY AND PHYSICS ARE DISTINGUISHED BY THE NATURE OF THEIR CAUSAL LAWS NOT BY THEIR SUBJECT MATTER AT THE SAME TIME WE HELD THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN SUBJECT MATTER
THUS ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT EXACTLY IS SENSATION IN ANY GIVEN EXPERIENCE
IF WE ARE TO AVOID A PERFECTLY GRATUITOUS ASSUMPTION WE MUST DISPENSE WITH THE SUBJECT AS ONE OF THE ACTUAL INGREDIENTS OF THE WORLD BUT WHEN WE DO THIS THE POSSIBILITY OF DISTINGUISHING THE SENSATION FROM THE SENSE DATUM VANISHES
AND THE SUCCESSIVE WAVES OF FURY AND DISAPPOINTMENT MENTAL EFFECTS IMAGES ON THE CONTRARY THOUGH THEY MAY PRODUCE BODILY MOVEMENTS DO SO ACCORDING TO MNEMIC LAWS NOT ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF PHYSICS
AND WE ARE MORE DEPENDENT UPON ACTUAL SENSATION IF WE FOUND OURSELVES IN A FOREIGN WORLD WHERE TABLES LOOKED LIKE CUSHIONS AND CUSHIONS LIKE TABLES WE SHOULD SIMILARLY DISCOVER HOW MUCH OF WHAT WE THINK WE SEE IS REALLY INFERENCE
WE MIGHT PLACE SUCH AN INSTRUMENT IN A PERSON'S MOUTH AND THEN TELL HIM TO RECITE A POEM TO HIMSELF AS FAR AS POSSIBLE ONLY IN IMAGINATION I SHOULD NOT BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF IT WERE FOUND THAT ACTUAL SMALL MOVEMENTS TAKE PLACE WHILE HE IS MENTALLY SAYING OVER THE VERSES
BUT NOT A THING OF WHICH WE MUST BE CONSCIOUS WE HAVE BEEN LED IN THE COURSE OF OUR INQUIRY
THERE ARE MANY OTHERS THAT ARE FAR MORE DIFFICULT AND THE DEFINITION OF IMAGES IS BY NO MEANS AN EASY PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH WE DO NOT ALWAYS KNOW WHETHER WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING IS A SENSATION OR AN IMAGE THE THINGS WE SEE IN DREAMS WHEN OUR EYES ARE SHUT
AND THIS ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT THAT IMAGES AND SENSATIONS CANNOT ALWAYS BE DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR INTRINSIC NATURE IMAGES ALSO DIFFER FROM SENSATIONS AS REGARDS THEIR EFFECTS SENSATIONS AS A RULE HAVE BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EFFECTS
TWO BY OUR ABSENCE OF BELIEF IN THEIR PHYSICAL REALITY THREE BY THE FACT THAT THEIR CAUSES AND EFFECTS ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF SENSATIONS
IT IS OF COURSE UNDENIABLE THAT KNOWLEDGE COMES THROUGH THE SEEING BUT I THINK IT IS A MISTAKE TO REGARD THE MERE SEEING ITSELF AS KNOWLEDGE IF WE ARE SO TO REGARD IT WE MUST DISTINGUISH THE SEEING FROM WHAT IS SEEN WE MUST SAY THAT WHEN WE SEE A PATCH OF COLOUR OF A CERTAIN SHAPE
SINCE MEMORY IS FALLIBLE A SIMILAR DIFFICULTY ARISES AS REGARDS CONSCIOUSNESS OF PAST OBJECTS IT WOULD SEEM ODD TO SAY THAT WE CAN BE CONSCIOUS OF A THING WHICH DOES NOT OR DID NOT EXIST
WE COULD DISTINGUISH IMAGES FROM SENSATIONS AS HAVING MNEMIC CAUSES THOUGH THEY MAY ALSO HAVE PHYSICAL CAUSES SENSATIONS ON THE OTHER HAND WILL ONLY HAVE PHYSICAL CAUSES HOWEVER THIS MAY BE
CONSISTS OF A CORE OF SENSATION TOGETHER WITH ASSOCIATED IMAGES WITH BELIEF IN THE PRESENT EXISTENCE OF AN OBJECT TO WHICH SENSATION AND IMAGES ARE REFERRED IN A WAY WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO ANALYSE PERHAPS WE MIGHT SAY
WE THERE DECIDED THAT THOSE PARTICULARS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE PHYSICAL WORLD CAN BE COLLECTED INTO SETS IN TWO WAYS ONE OF WHICH MAKES A BUNDLE OF ALL THOSE PARTICULARS THAT ARE APPEARANCES OF A GIVEN THING FROM DIFFERENT PLACES
IF THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CAUSATION WERE CLEAR AND SHARP AS A MATTER OF FACT HOWEVER THIS DISTINCTION IS AS YET BY NO MEANS SHARP IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WITH FULLER KNOWLEDGE IT WILL BE FOUND TO BE NO MORE ULTIMATE
IT IS SUGGESTED THAT MOTOR MEMORY IS PHYSIOLOGICAL WHILE VISUAL AND AUDITORY MEMORY ARE MORE TRULY PSYCHOLOGICAL BUT THAT IS NOT THE POINT WHICH CONCERNS US IN THE ILLUSTRATION THE POINT WHICH CONCERNS US IS THAT A LAW OF ASSOCIATION
AND UNTIL LATELY I DID SO REGARD IT WHEN SAY I SEE A PERSON I KNOW COMING TOWARDS ME IN THE STREET IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THE MERE SEEING WERE KNOWLEDGE
AND MENTAL WHEN IT OBEYS CAUSAL LAWS APPROPRIATE TO THE MENTAL WORLD SINCE THE MENTAL WORLD AND THE PHYSICAL WORLD INTERACT THERE WOULD BE A BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE TWO THERE WOULD BE EVENTS WHICH WOULD HAVE PHYSICAL CAUSES AND MENTAL EFFECTS WHILE THERE WOULD BE OTHERS WHICH WOULD HAVE MENTAL CAUSES AND PHYSICAL EFFECTS
IF A SENSIBLE STIMULUS A CALLS UP AN IMAGE OF B AND WE THEN ACT WITH REFERENCE TO B WE HAVE WHAT MAY BE CALLED CONSCIOUSNESS OF B
THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID THIS AWKWARDNESS IS TO ADD TO OUR DEFINITION THE PROVISO THAT THE BELIEFS INVOLVED IN CONSCIOUSNESS MUST BE TRUE IN THE SECOND PLACE THE QUESTION ARISES AS TO WHETHER WE CAN BE CONSCIOUS OF IMAGES
NAMELY SUBJECTIVITY SUBJECTIVITY AS A CHARACTERISTIC OF MENTAL PHENOMENA
BUT AS REGARDS SIMPLE IDEAS HE STATES THAT EVERY SIMPLE IDEA HAS A SIMPLE IMPRESSION WHICH RESEMBLES IT
I HAVE MAINTAINED THAT SENSATIONS ARE DATA FOR PSYCHOLOGY AND PHYSICS EQUALLY WHILE IMAGES WHICH MAY BE IN SOME SENSE EXCLUSIVELY PSYCHOLOGICAL DATA CAN ONLY BE DISTINGUISHED FROM SENSATIONS BY THEIR CORRELATIONS
SENSATIONS COME THROUGH SENSE ORGANS WHILE IMAGES DO NOT WE CANNOT HAVE VISUAL SENSATIONS IN THE DARK OR WITH OUR EYES SHUT BUT WE CAN VERY WELL HAVE VISUAL IMAGES UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES ACCORDINGLY IMAGES HAVE BEEN DEFINED AS CENTRALLY EXCITED SENSATIONS
WHEN THESE ASSOCIATIONS ARE ACTIVE AN IMAGE MEANS AN IMAGE INSTEAD OF MEANING ITS PROTOTYPE IF I HAVE HAD IMAGES OF A GIVEN PROTOTYPE MANY TIMES I CAN MEAN ONE OF THESE AS OPPOSED TO THE REST
WILL THE ASSOCIATION WORK IN EITHER DIRECTION OR ONLY FROM THE ONE WHICH HAS OCCURRED EARLIER TO THE ONE WHICH HAS OCCURRED LATER IN AN ARTICLE BY MISTER WOHLGEMUTH CALLED THE DIRECTION OF ASSOCIATIONS
WHEN WE CALL UP A VISUAL IMAGE OF A CHAIR WE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SIT IN IT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT LIKE MACBETH'S DAGGER IT IS NOT SENSIBLE TO FEELING AS TO SIGHT
THIS IS A MATTER FOR THE PSYCHOLOGIST AND BY NO MEANS AN EASY MATTER FOR OUR PURPOSES IT IS NOT IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE WHAT EXACTLY IS THE SENSATIONAL CORE IN ANY CASE IT IS ONLY IMPORTANT TO NOTICE
AND IS USUALLY TREATED BY MEN OF SCIENCE AS THOUGH IT WERE PERFECTLY CLEAR PSYCHOLOGISTS ON THE OTHER HAND FIND GREAT DIFFICULTY IN THE CONCEPTION DATA ARE NATURALLY DEFINED IN TERMS OF THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE
FROM BOTH ENDS THEREFORE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DATA IS DIMINISHED IS THERE ULTIMATELY NO DIFFERENCE OR DO IMAGES REMAIN AS IRREDUCIBLY AND EXCLUSIVELY PSYCHOLOGICAL
WE DO NOT HAVE A DATUM UNLESS WE HAVE A JUDGMENT OF PERCEPTION IN THE SENSE IN WHICH OBJECTS AS OPPOSED TO PROPOSITIONS ARE DATA IT WOULD SEEM NATURAL TO SAY THAT THOSE OBJECTS OF WHICH WE ARE CONSCIOUS ARE DATA
BEFORE WE CAN DISCUSS THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WE MUST FIRST BE CLEAR AS TO WHAT OUR QUESTION MEANS WHEN GIVEN A IT IS POSSIBLE TO INFER B BUT GIVEN B IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INFER A
THAT SUGGESTION WHOSE HORRID IMAGE DOTH UNFIX MY HAIR AND MAKE MY SEATED HEART KNOCK AT MY RIBS AGAINST THE USE OF NATURE
WE MIGHT ATTEMPT TO DISTINGUISH IMAGES FROM SENSATIONS BY OUR ABSENCE OF BELIEF IN THE PHYSICAL REALITY OF IMAGES WHEN WE ARE AWARE THAT WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING IS AN IMAGE
THE BELIEF MUST BE OF THAT SORT THAT CONSTITUTES OBJECTIVE REFERENCE PAST OR PRESENT AN IMAGE TOGETHER WITH A BELIEF OF THIS SORT CONCERNING IT CONSTITUTES ACCORDING TO OUR DEFINITION CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PROTOTYPE OF THE IMAGE
FOR IN THIS CASE THE SENSATION IS A SIGN OF THE PERCEIVED OBJECT IN MUCH THE SAME WAY IN WHICH A MEMORY IMAGE IS A SIGN OF A REMEMBERED OBJECT THE ESSENTIAL PRACTICAL FUNCTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THOUGHT
IT IS CLEAR IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THERE CAN BE NO DATUM APART FROM A BELIEF A SENSATION WHICH MERELY COMES AND GOES IS NOT A DATUM IT ONLY BECOMES A DATUM WHEN IT IS REMEMBERED SIMILARLY IN PERCEPTION
PLAIN FACTS IN THE INTERESTS OF A THEORY NAMELY THE SUPPOSED IMPOSSIBILITY OF INTROSPECTION
THE ULTIMATE DATA OF PSYCHOLOGY ARE ONLY SENSATIONS AND IMAGES AND THEIR RELATIONS BELIEFS DESIRES VOLITIONS AND SO ON APPEARED TO US TO BE COMPLEX PHENOMENA CONSISTING OF SENSATIONS AND IMAGES VARIOUSLY INTERRELATED
WE CAN MORE OR LESS GUESS HOW AN OCCURRENCE PRODUCES A CHANGE IN THE BRAIN AND HOW ITS REPETITION GRADUALLY PRODUCES SOMETHING ANALOGOUS TO THE CHANNEL OF A RIVER
WHEN IN WHAT FOLLOWS I SPEAK OF DATA I DO NOT MEAN THE THINGS OF WHICH WE FEEL SURE BEFORE SCIENTIFIC STUDY BEGINS BUT THE THINGS WHICH
IN THE FIRST LECTURE I GAVE VARIOUS ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE VIEW THAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS FUNDAMENTAL BUT I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO SAY WHAT CONSCIOUSNESS IS WE MUST FIND A DEFINITION OF IT IF WE ARE TO FEEL SECURE IN DECIDING THAT IT IS NOT FUNDAMENTAL
IS CLEARLY AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN THE DEFINITION I HAVE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THESE LECTURES THAT THE DATA OF PSYCHOLOGY DO NOT DIFFER IN THEIR INTRINSIC CHARACTER FROM THE DATA OF PHYSICS
THE POINT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT IS CALLED THOUGHT CONSISTS MAINLY THOUGH I THINK NOT WHOLLY OF INNER SPEECH IF PROFESSOR WATSON IS RIGHT AS REGARDS INNER SPEECH THIS WHOLE REGION IS TRANSFERRED FROM IMAGINATION TO SENSATION
BUT IN ANY CASE IT IS NOT A PUBLIC EVENT LIKE AN ACTUAL PERSON WALKING IN AT THE DOOR AND SITTING DOWN IN MY CHAIR AND IT CANNOT LIKE INNER SPEECH BE REGARDED AS A SMALL SENSATION SINCE IT OCCUPIES JUST AS LARGE AN AREA IN MY VISUAL FIELD AS THE ACTUAL SENSATION WOULD DO
IT REMAINS TO INQUIRE WHETHER ALL THE DATA OF PSYCHOLOGY ARE ALSO DATA OF PHYSICAL SCIENCE AND ESPECIALLY OF PHYSIOLOGY IF WE HAVE BEEN RIGHT IN OUR ANALYSIS OF MIND
WE MAY MEET THIS DIFFICULTY IN TWO WAYS EITHER BY BOLDLY DENYING CONSCIOUSNESS OF IMAGES OR BY FINDING A SENSE IN WHICH BY MEANS OF A DIFFERENT ACCOMPANYING BELIEF AN IMAGE INSTEAD OF MEANING ITS PROTOTYPE
WE DENY ALL ACTION OF THE OUTER WORLD UPON US SENSATIONS ARE OBVIOUSLY THE SOURCE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD INCLUDING OUR OWN BODY
I SHALL THEN BRIEFLY SKETCH THE NATURE OF THAT FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE THE TRUE METAPHYSIC IN WHICH MIND AND MATTER ALIKE ARE SEEN TO BE CONSTRUCTED OUT OF A NEUTRAL STUFF WHOSE CAUSAL LAWS HAVE NO SUCH DUALITY AS THAT OF PSYCHOLOGY
BUT SINCE THE QUESTION IS CAPABLE OF EXPERIMENTAL DECISION IT WOULD BE GRATUITOUS RASHNESS TO OFFER AN OPINION WHILE THAT DECISION IS LACKING BUT VISUAL AND AUDITORY IMAGES ARE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH IN THIS WAY
WHICH IT WOULD HAVE IF IT WERE A VISUAL SENSATION AND NOT MERELY A VISUAL IMAGE BUT THIS MEANS THAT THE SO CALLED UNREALITY OF IMAGES CONSISTS MERELY IN THEIR NOT OBEYING THE LAWS OF PHYSICS
WE CANNOT IN GENERAL POINT TO ANYTHING UNIQUE AS THE CAUSE OF SUCH AND SUCH AN EVENT AND FINALLY IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT THE PECULIAR CAUSAL LAWS WHICH GOVERN MENTAL EVENTS
HUME WHO GIVES THE NAMES IMPRESSIONS AND IDEAS TO WHAT MAY FOR PRESENT PURPOSES BE IDENTIFIED WITH OUR SENSATIONS AND IMAGES SPEAKS OF IMPRESSIONS AS THOSE PERCEPTIONS WHICH ENTER WITH MOST FORCE AND VIOLENCE
EVERY ONE OF HIMSELF WILL READILY PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE BETWIXT FEELING AND THINKING THE COMMON DEGREES OF THESE ARE EASILY DISTINGUISHED THOUGH IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IN PARTICULAR INSTANCES THEY MAY VERY NEARLY APPROACH TO EACH OTHER
WE HAVE SEEN THAT THEY ARE SUBJECT TO MNENIC CAUSATION AND THAT MNENIC CAUSATION MAY BE REDUCIBLE TO ORDINARY PHYSICAL CAUSATION IN NERVOUS TISSUE THIS IS THE QUESTION UPON WHICH OUR ATTITUDE MUST TURN TOWARDS WHAT MAY BE CALLED MATERIALISM
A SENSATION WHICH IS REMEMBERED BECOMES AN OBJECT OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS SOON AS IT BEGINS TO BE REMEMBERED WHICH WILL NORMALLY BE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER ITS OCCURRENCE IF AT ALL
BUT IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN EXCEPT BY ACCIDENT THAT A CAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH A MAT AND IN LIKE MANNER AN IMAGE MAY HAVE CERTAIN ASSOCIATIONS WHICH ITS PROTOTYPE WILL NOT HAVE
B IS DEPENDENT UPON A IN RESPECT OF THIS RELATION
THIS IS THE SORT OF BELIEF WHICH IN THE CASE OF MEMORY WE EXPRESSED IN THE WORDS THIS OCCURRED OR WHICH IN THE CASE OF A JUDGMENT OF PERCEPTION MAKES US BELIEVE IN QUALITIES CORRELATED WITH PRESENT SENSATIONS AS
BUT WHILE IT EXISTS IT IS NOT AN OBJECT OF CONSCIOUSNESS IF HOWEVER IT IS PART OF A PERCEPTION SAY OF SOME FAMILIAR PERSON
SINCE THEIR EFFECTS AS SIGNS ARE PRODIGIOUS WHILE THEIR INTRINSIC INTEREST AS SENSIBLE OCCURRENCES ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT IS USUALLY VERY SLIGHT THE OPERATION OF SIGNS MAY OR MAY NOT BE ACCOMPANIED BY CONSCIOUSNESS
UNTIL HE DID IT WHILST HE WAS SITTING THERE HE THOUGHT OF HIS DEAREST MOTHER AND WISHED THAT ONE OF THE KING'S PRINCIPAL SERVANTS WOULD BEGIN TO SPEAK OF HER AND WOULD ASK HOW IT WAS FARING WITH THE QUEEN IN THE TOWER AND IF SHE WERE ALIVE STILL
SO THAT HE DID NOT WAKE UP TILL THE CLOCK WAS STRIKING A QUARTER TO TWELVE THEN HE SPRANG FROM THE COUCH DREADFULLY FRIGHTENED RAN TO THE WELL FILLED A CUP THAT WAS STANDING BY HIM FULL OF WATER AND HASTENED TO GET AWAY IN TIME
ONCE FELL VERY ILL SO ILL THAT NOBODY THOUGHT HE COULD LIVE HIS SONS WERE VERY MUCH GRIEVED AT THEIR FATHER'S SICKNESS AND AS THEY WERE WALKING TOGETHER VERY MOURNFULLY IN THE GARDEN OF THE PALACE
BUT THE KING'S SON SOON FELL ASLEEP AND WHEN HE AWOKE IN THE MORNING HE FOUND THAT THE PRINCESSES HAD ALL BEEN DANCING FOR THE SOLES OF THEIR SHOES WERE FULL OF HOLES THE SAME THING HAPPENED THE SECOND AND THIRD NIGHT SO THE KING
SO THAT WHEN SHE PUT THE CUP TO HER MOUTH IT WAS EMPTY AT THIS TOO THE YOUNGEST SISTER WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED BUT THE ELDEST ALWAYS SILENCED HER
SAID THE PRINCE HAUGHTILY AND RODE ON BUT THE DWARF WAS ENRAGED AT HIS BEHAVIOUR AND LAID A FAIRY SPELL OF ILL LUCK UPON HIM SO THAT AS HE RODE ON THE MOUNTAIN PASS BECAME NARROWER
AND EVERY THING HAPPENED JUST AS BEFORE THE PRINCESSES DANCED EACH TIME TILL THEIR SHOES WERE WORN TO PIECES AND THEN RETURNED HOME HOWEVER ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE SOLDIER CARRIED AWAY ONE OF THE GOLDEN CUPS AS A TOKEN OF WHERE HE HAD BEEN
AND THE NEEDLE CRIED OUT STOP STOP
THE CHAMBER DOOR WAS LOCKED AND SHE WAS LEFT ALONE SHE SAT DOWN IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO BEWAIL HER HARD FATE WHEN ON A SUDDEN THE DOOR OPENED AND A DROLL LOOKING LITTLE MAN HOBBLED IN AND SAID
LET HIM COME IN SO THEY BROUGHT IN A DIRTY LOOKING FELLOW AND WHEN HE HAD SUNG BEFORE THE KING AND THE PRINCESS HE BEGGED A BOON THEN THE KING SAID
PRINCE PRINCE LOOK AGAIN FOR THY BRIDE FOR SHE'S NOT THE TRUE ONE THAT SITS BY THY SIDE THEN HE LOOKED DOWN AND SAW THAT THE BLOOD STREAMED SO MUCH FROM THE SHOE THAT HER WHITE STOCKINGS WERE QUITE RED SO HE TURNED HIS HORSE AND BROUGHT HER ALSO BACK AGAIN
A LITTLE OLD MAN MET THEM AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER THEY TOLD HIM THAT THEIR FATHER WAS VERY ILL AND THAT THEY WERE AFRAID NOTHING COULD SAVE HIM I KNOW WHAT WOULD SAID THE LITTLE OLD MAN
ROUND WENT THE WHEEL AGAIN TO THE OLD SONG AND THE MANIKIN ONCE MORE SPUN THE HEAP INTO GOLD THE KING CAME IN THE MORNING AND FINDING ALL HE WANTED WAS FORCED TO KEEP HIS WORD
BEFORE THE SQUIRREL TAKES THEM ALL AWAY WITH ALL MY HEART SAID PARTLET LET US GO AND MAKE A HOLIDAY OF IT TOGETHER SO THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS AND AS IT WAS A LOVELY DAY THEY STAYED THERE TILL THE EVENING
NEVER MIND WILL DO BETTER NEXT TIME WHITHER AWAY HANS TO GRETEL MOTHER BEHAVE WELL HANS I'LL BEHAVE WELL GOODBYE MOTHER GOODBYE HANS HANS COMES TO GRETEL GOOD DAY GRETEL
IT IS NOT WELL FOR YOU TO BE SO ALONE WISH FOR A PRETTY GIRL AS A COMPANION THEN THE KING'S SON WISHED FOR ONE AND SHE IMMEDIATELY STOOD BEFORE HIM AND WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN ANY PAINTER COULD HAVE PAINTED HER
AND HAVING DONE THIS THEY CREPT AWAY AS SOFTLY AS POSSIBLE HOWEVER THE DUCK WHO SLEPT IN THE OPEN AIR IN THE YARD HEARD THEM COMING AND JUMPING INTO THE BROOK WHICH RAN CLOSE BY THE INN SOON SWAM OUT OF THEIR REACH
YOU HAVE LEARNT WISDOM AND IT IS TIME TO HOLD OUR MARRIAGE FEAST THEN THE CHAMBERLAINS CAME AND BROUGHT HER THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ROBES AND HER FATHER AND HIS WHOLE COURT WERE THERE ALREADY
IN WHICH NEITHER SUN NOR MOON COULD BE SEEN AND HAD HIS WIFE PUT INTO IT AND WALLED UP HERE SHE WAS TO STAY FOR SEVEN YEARS WITHOUT MEAT OR DRINK AND DIE OF HUNGER
THE OTHERS WERE ALL OBLIGED TO RETIRE TO A DISTANCE AND WHEN THE PEASANT LOOKED AT THE PRIEST HE RECOGNIZED THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE MILLER'S WIFE HE SAID TO HIM I SET YOU FREE FROM THE CLOSET SET ME FREE FROM THE BARREL AT THIS SAME MOMENT UP CAME
I WILL LAY MYSELF ACROSS THE STREAM AND YOU SHALL PASS OVER UPON ME
HANS TAKES THE BACON TIES IT TO A ROPE AND DRAGS IT AWAY BEHIND HIM THE DOGS COME AND DEVOUR THE BACON WHEN HE GETS HOME HE HAS THE ROPE IN HIS HAND AND THERE IS NO LONGER ANYTHING HANGING ON TO IT GOOD EVENING MOTHER
WITH GRETEL WHAT DID YOU TAKE HER TOOK NOTHING SHE GAVE ME SOMETHING WHAT DID GRETEL GIVE YOU SHE GAVE ME A GOAT WHERE IS THE GOAT HANS PUT IT IN MY POCKET THAT WAS ILL DONE HANS
THE CAT HAD NO COUSIN AND HAD NOT BEEN ASKED TO BE GODMOTHER SHE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE CHURCH STOLE TO THE POT OF FAT BEGAN TO LICK AT IT AND LICKED THE TOP OF THE FAT OFF THEN SHE TOOK A WALK UPON THE ROOFS OF THE TOWN LOOKED OUT FOR OPPORTUNITIES
AND WANTED TO PUNISH HIS WICKED SONS BUT THEY MADE THEIR ESCAPE AND GOT INTO A SHIP AND SAILED AWAY OVER THE WIDE SEA AND WHERE THEY WENT TO NOBODY KNEW AND NOBODY CARED
GOOD DAY GRETEL GOOD DAY HANS WHAT DO YOU BRING THAT IS GOOD I BRING NOTHING I WANT TO HAVE SOMETHING GIVEN TO ME GRETEL PRESENTS HANS WITH A KNIFE GOODBYE GRETEL GOODBYE HANS
ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED TO APPEAR BEFORE MY EYES I WILL SEND YOU TO A THIRD MASTER BUT IF YOU LEARN NOTHING THIS TIME ALSO I WILL NO LONGER BE YOUR FATHER THE YOUTH REMAINED A WHOLE YEAR WITH THE THIRD MASTER ALSO
IN HIS BED AND TOSSED ABOUT IN HIS ANXIETY HE GROANED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE
DO NOT DISTRESS YOURSELF I WILL SOON FIND A WAY TO HELP US AND WHEN THE OLD FOLKS HAD FALLEN ASLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS LITTLE COAT OPENED THE DOOR BELOW AND CREPT OUTSIDE
MANY HAD ALREADY MADE THE ATTEMPT BUT IN VAIN NEVERTHELESS WHEN THE YOUTH SAW THE KING'S DAUGHTER
THE PEASANT HOWEVER MADE OFF NEXT MORNING BY DAYBREAK WITH THE THREE HUNDRED TALERS AT HOME THE SMALL PEASANT GRADUALLY LAUNCHED OUT HE BUILT A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AND THE PEASANTS SAID THE SMALL PEASANT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN TO THE PLACE WHERE GOLDEN SNOW FALLS
AND THERE HE SAW TWO OLD RAVENS STANDING BY THEIR NEST AND THROWING OUT THEIR YOUNG ONES OUT WITH YOU YOU IDLE GOOD FOR NOTHING CREATURES CRIED THEY WE CANNOT FIND FOOD FOR YOU ANY LONGER YOU ARE BIG ENOUGH AND CAN PROVIDE FOR YOURSELVES BUT THE POOR YOUNG RAVENS LAY UPON THE GROUND
SO THAT WE CAN PUT THE BREAD IN AND ONCE GRETEL WAS INSIDE SHE INTENDED TO SHUT THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE IN IT AND THEN SHE WOULD EAT HER TOO BUT GRETEL SAW WHAT SHE HAD IN MIND AND SAID
THEY SAW A BEAUTIFUL SNOW WHITE BIRD SITTING ON A BOUGH WHICH SANG SO DELIGHTFULLY THAT THEY STOOD STILL AND LISTENED TO IT AND WHEN ITS SONG WAS OVER IT SPREAD ITS WINGS AND FLEW AWAY BEFORE THEM
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE STAIRS THE SOLDIER RAN ON BEFORE THE PRINCESSES AND LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND AS THE TWELVE SISTERS SLOWLY CAME UP VERY MUCH TIRED THEY HEARD HIM SNORING IN HIS BED SO THEY SAID
WAS TAKEN TO THE CHAMBER NEXT TO THE ONE WHERE THE PRINCESSES LAY IN THEIR TWELVE BEDS THERE HE WAS TO SIT AND WATCH WHERE THEY WENT TO DANCE AND IN ORDER THAT NOTHING MIGHT PASS WITHOUT HIS HEARING IT THE DOOR OF HIS CHAMBER WAS LEFT OPEN
HANS TAKES THE KNIFE STICKS IT IN HIS SLEEVE AND GOES HOME GOOD EVENING MOTHER GOOD EVENING HANS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN WITH GRETEL WHAT DID YOU TAKE HER TOOK HER NOTHING SHE GAVE ME SOMETHING WHAT DID GRETEL GIVE YOU
AND ON THE BRANCH SAT A LITTLE DOVE SINGING BACK AGAIN BACK AGAIN LOOK TO THE SHOE THE SHOE IS TOO SMALL AND NOT MADE FOR YOU PRINCE PRINCE LOOK AGAIN FOR THY BRIDE FOR SHE'S NOT THE TRUE ONE THAT SITS BY THY SIDE
TAKING HER WITH HIM THEN HE TOLD HIM EVERYTHING HOW HIS BROTHERS HAD CHEATED AND ROBBED HIM AND YET THAT HE HAD BORNE ALL THOSE WRONGS FOR THE LOVE OF HIS FATHER AND THE OLD KING WAS VERY ANGRY
AND HAD HEARD WHAT THEIR STEPMOTHER HAD SAID TO THEIR FATHER GRETEL WEPT BITTER TEARS AND SAID TO HANSEL NOW ALL IS OVER WITH US BE QUIET GRETEL SAID HANSEL
AND WISHED HIM BACK INTO THE FORM OF THE COOK IN THE WHICH HE STOOD IMMEDIATELY WITH HIS WHITE APRON AND HIS KNIFE BY HIS SIDE WHEN THE KING SAW HIM HE FELL INTO A PASSION
I AM NOT VERY YOUNG SO I WILL HAVE THE ELDEST AND THEY WERE MARRIED THAT VERY DAY
HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS THE NUTS ARE QUITE RIPE NOW SAID CHANTICLEER TO HIS WIFE PARTLET SUPPOSE WE GO TOGETHER TO THE MOUNTAINS AND EAT AS MANY AS WE CAN
I HARDLY KNOW WHERE I AM GOING OR WHAT I HAD BETTER DO SAID THE SOLDIER BUT I THINK I SHOULD LIKE VERY WELL TO FIND OUT WHERE IT IS THAT THE PRINCESSES DANCE AND THEN IN TIME I MIGHT BE A KING WELL SAID THE OLD DAME
THE GUARDS SAID HE WAS NOT THE TRUE PRINCE AND THAT HE TOO MUST GO AWAY ABOUT HIS BUSINESS AND AWAY HE WENT NOW WHEN THE FULL YEAR WAS COME ROUND THE THIRD BROTHER
AND ONE SAID IN A PITIFUL TONE
HE COULD NOT BE WHAT HE SAID HE WAS AND MUST GO ABOUT HIS BUSINESS THE SECOND PRINCE SET OUT SOON AFTERWARDS ON THE SAME ERRAND AND WHEN HE CAME TO THE GOLDEN ROAD AND HIS HORSE HAD SET ONE FOOT UPON IT
IF YOU COME UP AGAIN WITHOUT IT YOU WILL BE THROWN IN AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL YOU PERISH AMID THE WAVES ALL THE PEOPLE GRIEVED FOR THE HANDSOME YOUTH THEN THEY WENT AWAY LEAVING HIM ALONE BY THE SEA HE STOOD ON THE SHORE AND CONSIDERED WHAT HE SHOULD DO
AND SHOWED THEM THE WAY THEY WALKED THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG AND BY BREAK OF DAY CAME ONCE MORE TO THEIR FATHER'S HOUSE THEY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND WHEN THE WOMAN OPENED IT AND SAW THAT IT WAS HANSEL AND GRETEL SHE SAID
AS YOU ARE SO CLEVER YOU SHALL SIT BY ME HE REPLIED LORD KING YOUR MAJESTY MUST EXCUSE ME I AM A POOR HUNTSMAN BUT THE KING INSISTED ON IT AND SAID
YOU WILL ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD ENJOY STICKING THAT DAINTY TONGUE OF YOURS OUT OF THE WINDOW THEY SET OUT ON THEIR WAY BUT WHEN THEY ARRIVED THE POT OF FAT CERTAINLY WAS STILL IN ITS PLACE BUT IT WAS EMPTY ALAS SAID THE MOUSE NOW I SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED NOW IT COMES TO LIGHT
I NEVER HEARD THE NAME IN MY LIFE I'LL WAGER ANYTHING IT IS NOT IN THE CALENDAR THE CAT'S MOUTH SOON BEGAN TO WATER FOR SOME MORE LICKING ALL GOOD THINGS GO IN THREES SAID SHE I AM ASKED TO STAND GODMOTHER AGAIN THE CHILD IS QUITE BLACK
SO WORDS AND TEARS WERE OF NO AVAIL THE PARSON WAS SENT FOR AND SHE WAS MARRIED TO THE FIDDLER WHEN THIS WAS OVER THE KING SAID NOW GET READY TO GO YOU MUST NOT STAY HERE
HOW ARE WE TO FEED OUR POOR CHILDREN WHEN WE NO LONGER HAVE ANYTHING EVEN FOR OURSELVES I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HUSBAND ANSWERED THE WOMAN EARLY TOMORROW MORNING WE WILL TAKE THE CHILDREN OUT INTO THE FOREST
THAT IS THE MOST SUSPICIOUS NAME OF ALL I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT IN PRINT ALL GONE WHAT CAN THAT MEAN AND SHE SHOOK HER HEAD CURLED HERSELF UP AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP FROM THIS TIME FORTH NO ONE INVITED THE CAT TO BE GODMOTHER
ALL ON A SUDDEN AS SHE WAS GOING OUT IN CAME THE KING'S SON IN GOLDEN CLOTHES
NOW WILL I SHOW HER TO YOU IN HER OWN FORM AND WISHED THAT SHE MIGHT BECOME A MAIDEN
AND PUT ON THE GOLDEN SLIPPER AND IT FITTED HER AS IF IT HAD BEEN MADE FOR HER AND WHEN HE DREW NEAR AND LOOKED AT HER FACE HE KNEW HER AND SAID THIS IS THE RIGHT BRIDE BUT THE MOTHER AND BOTH THE SISTERS WERE FRIGHTENED AND TURNED PALE WITH ANGER AS HE TOOK ASHPUTTEL ON HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY WITH HER
WHEREUPON THE PEASANTS CRIED WE ALREADY SEE THE SHEEP DOWN BELOW THE MAYOR PRESSED FORWARD AND SAID I WILL GO DOWN FIRST AND LOOK ABOUT ME AND IF THINGS PROMISE WELL I'LL CALL YOU
BUT THE BRIDE SAID RUN FIRST AND BRING ME MY GARLAND THAT IS HANGING ON A WILLOW IN THE GARDEN
PUT OUT THEIR HEADS AND CRIED TO HIM WE WILL REMEMBER YOU AND REPAY YOU FOR SAVING US HE RODE ON AND AFTER A WHILE IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE HEARD A VOICE IN THE SAND AT HIS FEET HE LISTENED AND HEARD AN ANT KING COMPLAIN
AND THERE SAT A RAVEN WITH BROKEN WINGS AND OUT OF PITY HE TOOK HIM AND WRAPPED HIM IN THE SKIN BUT AS THE WEATHER GREW SO BAD AND THERE WAS A STORM OF RAIN AND WIND HE COULD GO NO FARTHER AND TURNED BACK TO THE MILL AND BEGGED FOR SHELTER
WHEN HE GETS HOME IT IS SUFFOCATED GOOD EVENING MOTHER
GOOD EVENING HANS WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN WITH GRETEL WHAT DID YOU TAKE HER I TOOK HER NOTHING SHE GAVE ME SOMETHING WHAT DID GRETEL GIVE YOU GAVE ME A BIT OF BACON WHERE IS THE BACON HANS
MY COUSIN HAS BROUGHT A LITTLE SON INTO THE WORLD AND HAS ASKED ME TO BE GODMOTHER HE IS WHITE WITH BROWN SPOTS AND I AM TO HOLD HIM OVER THE FONT AT THE CHRISTENING
IF THE CHILD HAS THE POWER OF WISHING AND I AM HERE HE MIGHT VERY EASILY GET ME INTO TROUBLE SO HE LEFT THE PALACE AND WENT TO THE BOY WHO WAS ALREADY BIG ENOUGH TO SPEAK AND SAID TO HIM
THE LITTLE PEASANT CALLED THE COW HERD IN AND SAID LOOK I HAVE A LITTLE CALF THERE BUT IT IS STILL SMALL AND HAS TO BE CARRIED THE COW HERD SAID ALL RIGHT AND TOOK IT IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED IT TO THE PASTURE AND SET IT AMONG THE GRASS
THAN THAT IT WAS THE PEASANT WHO WAS SAYING THIS AND ANSWERED THAT IS WHAT WE INTEND BUT FIRST YOU SHALL LOOK ABOUT YOU A LITTLE DOWN BELOW THERE AND THEY ROLLED THE BARREL DOWN INTO THE WATER AFTER THAT THE PEASANTS WENT HOME
YOU SIMPLETONS YOU SHOULD HAVE CUT THE ROSE BUSH IN TWO AND HAVE BROKEN OFF THE ROSE AND BROUGHT IT HOME WITH YOU GO AND DO IT AT ONCE THEY HAD THEREFORE TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR THE SECOND TIME THE CHILDREN HOWEVER SAW THEM COMING FROM A DISTANCE THEN LINA SAID FUNDEVOGEL
SO HE SET OUT AND THE DWARF MET HIM TOO AT THE SAME SPOT IN THE VALLEY AMONG THE MOUNTAINS AND SAID PRINCE WHITHER SO FAST AND THE PRINCE SAID
WHEN A CHILD FELL INTO HER POWER SHE KILLED IT COOKED AND ATE IT AND THAT WAS A FEAST DAY WITH HER WITCHES HAVE RED EYES AND CANNOT SEE FAR
NEVER MIND I'LL DO BETTER NEXT TIME WHITHER AWAY HANS TO GRETEL MOTHER BEHAVE WELL HANS OH I'LL BEHAVE WELL GOODBYE MOTHER GOODBYE HANS HANS COMES TO GRETEL
SO THEY WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO A GREAT LAKE AND AT THE SIDE OF THE LAKE THERE LAY TWELVE LITTLE BOATS WITH TWELVE HANDSOME PRINCES IN THEM WHO SEEMED TO BE WAITING THERE FOR THE PRINCESSES ONE OF THE PRINCESSES WENT INTO EACH BOAT
OH THEN SHE BEGAN TO HOWL QUITE HORRIBLY BUT GRETEL RAN AWAY AND THE GODLESS WITCH WAS MISERABLY BURNT TO DEATH GRETEL HOWEVER RAN LIKE LIGHTNING TO HANSEL
FOR I COULD NOT HAVE SHOT YOU THEN HE TOOK THE PRINCE'S COAT AND GAVE HIM THE SHABBY ONE AND WENT AWAY THROUGH THE WOOD SOME TIME AFTER THREE GRAND EMBASSIES CAME TO THE OLD KING'S COURT
YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR LIFE INTO THE BARGAIN BUT BE QUIET AND WE WILL LET YOU OFF
THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES THERE WAS A KING WHO HAD TWELVE BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS THEY SLEPT IN TWELVE BEDS ALL IN ONE ROOM AND WHEN THEY WENT TO BED THE DOORS WERE SHUT
AND WENT TO HER MOTHER'S GRAVE AND PLANTED IT THERE AND CRIED SO MUCH THAT IT WAS WATERED WITH HER TEARS AND THERE IT GREW AND BECAME A FINE TREE THREE TIMES EVERY DAY SHE WENT TO IT AND CRIED AND SOON A LITTLE BIRD CAME AND BUILT ITS NEST UPON THE TREE
UNTIL THEY AGREED ON THREE HUNDRED TALERS THEN THE PEASANT ONCE MORE PINCHED THE RAVEN'S HEAD TILL HE CROAKED LOUDLY THE MILLER ASKED WHAT DID HE SAY THE PEASANT REPLIED HE SAYS THAT THE DEVIL IS HIDING OUTSIDE THERE IN THE CLOSET ON THE PORCH THE MILLER SAID
NOW PARTLET FOUND A VERY LARGE NUT BUT SHE SAID NOTHING ABOUT IT TO CHANTICLEER AND KEPT IT ALL TO HERSELF
AND WE SHALL BE RID OF THEM NO WIFE SAID THE MAN I WILL NOT DO THAT HOW CAN I BEAR TO LEAVE MY CHILDREN ALONE IN THE FOREST THE WILD ANIMALS WOULD SOON COME
AND WHEN HE HAD WALKED A LONG WAY HE CAME TO A LARGE CITY THERE WAS A GREAT NOISE AND CROWD IN THE STREETS AND A MAN RODE UP ON HORSEBACK CRYING ALOUD THE KING'S DAUGHTER WANTS A HUSBAND BUT WHOEVER SEEKS HER HAND MUST PERFORM A HARD TASK
AND LED THE COW HERD BEFORE THE MAYOR WHO FOR HIS CARELESSNESS CONDEMNED HIM TO GIVE THE PEASANT A COW FOR THE CALF WHICH HAD RUN AWAY AND NOW THE LITTLE PEASANT AND HIS WIFE HAD THE COW FOR WHICH THEY HAD SO LONG WISHED AND THEY WERE HEARTILY GLAD
THEY SET OUT BUT THEY FOUND NO CRUMBS FOR THE MANY THOUSANDS OF BIRDS WHICH FLY ABOUT IN THE WOODS AND FIELDS HAD PICKED THEM ALL UP HANSEL SAID TO GRETEL WE SHALL SOON FIND THE WAY BUT THEY DID NOT FIND IT
AND SAW A WHITE SNAKE LYING ON THE DISH BUT WHEN HE SAW IT HE COULD NOT DENY HIMSELF THE PLEASURE OF TASTING IT SO HE CUT OF A LITTLE BIT AND PUT IT INTO HIS MOUTH NO SOONER HAD IT TOUCHED HIS TONGUE
CLEVER HANS THE MOTHER OF HANS SAID WHITHER AWAY HANS HANS ANSWERED TO GRETEL BEHAVE WELL HANS OH I'LL BEHAVE WELL GOODBYE MOTHER GOODBYE HANS
WAS BROUGHT TO HIM THROUGH THE AIR BUT HE HAD A STRANGE CUSTOM EVERY DAY AFTER DINNER WHEN THE TABLE WAS CLEARED AND NO ONE ELSE WAS PRESENT A TRUSTY SERVANT HAD TO BRING HIM ONE MORE DISH IT WAS COVERED HOWEVER
TRIED TO PRETEND TO THE COUNT THAT HE CONSIDERED THESE CONSULTATIONS VERY VALUABLE FOR THE PROPRIETOR AND TROUBLESOME TO HIMSELF IN KIEV PIERRE FOUND SOME PEOPLE HE KNEW AND STRANGERS HASTENED TO MAKE HIS ACQUAINTANCE AND JOYFULLY WELCOMED THE RICH NEWCOMER
LIEUTENANT HE HAS A DAGGER WERE THE FIRST WORDS PIERRE UNDERSTOOD AH A WEAPON SAID THE OFFICER AND TURNED TO THE BAREFOOTED SOLDIER WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED WITH PIERRE ALL RIGHT YOU CAN TELL ALL ABOUT IT AT THE COURT MARTIAL
AND THE WHOLE WORLD KNEW AND SO THE ANECDOTE ENDED THOUGH IT WAS UNINTELLIGIBLE WHY HE HAD TOLD IT OR WHY IT HAD TO BE TOLD IN RUSSIAN STILL
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT WAIT A BIT HE IS NOT DRUNK YET A BOTTLE HERE SAID ANATOLE TAKING A GLASS FROM THE TABLE HE WENT UP TO PIERRE FIRST OF ALL YOU MUST DRINK PIERRE DRANK ONE GLASS AFTER ANOTHER
FASTER STILL THE TWO TROYKAS FLEW SIDE BY SIDE AND FASTER MOVED THE FEET OF THE GALLOPING SIDE HORSES NICHOLAS BEGAN TO DRAW AHEAD
PRINCESS MARY LOOKED FRIGHTENED THE DOOR OPENED AND THE OLD PRINCE IN A DRESSING GOWN AND A WHITE NIGHTCAP CAME IN AH MADAM HE BEGAN MADAM COUNTESS
HONEST EYES WITH THE TEARS RISING IN THEM WHEN SHE HERSELF HAD BEGUN TO CRY AS SHE SPOKE OF HER LOSS DID NOT LEAVE HER MEMORY WHEN SHE HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF HIM AND REMAINED ALONE SHE SUDDENLY FELT HER EYES FILLING WITH TEARS
WITH THE SELF SATISFACTION OF A MAN ON PARADE HE STEPPED LIGHTLY WITH HIS MUSCULAR LEGS AS IF SAILING ALONG STRETCHING HIMSELF TO HIS FULL HEIGHT WITHOUT THE SMALLEST EFFORT HIS EASE CONTRASTING
AND CONSEQUENTLY HAD TO MOVE THEIR FORCES FROM RIGHT TO LEFT DURING THE BATTLE SO IT HAPPENED THAT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BATTLE THE RUSSIANS OPPOSED THE ENTIRE FRENCH ARMY LAUNCHED AGAINST OUR LEFT FLANK WITH BUT HALF AS MANY MEN
IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD LONG BEEN CONVINCED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE A MISTAKE AND THAT IN HIS PERCEPTION WHATEVER HE DID WAS RIGHT NOT BECAUSE IT HARMONIZED WITH ANY IDEA OF RIGHT AND WRONG BUT BECAUSE HE DID IT
HE SIGHED AND PRESSED ON THE BENCH WITH BOTH HANDS TO RAISE HIMSELF COME COME WITH ME WE'LL HAVE A TALK SAID HE
ROSE AND MADE A SIGN TO HIS WIFE THAT IT WAS TIME TO GO SUDDENLY PRINCE HIPPOLYTE STARTED UP MAKING SIGNS TO EVERYONE TO ATTEND
AND SO I WISH TO ARRANGE JUST A SMALL PARTY FOR MY OWN AND MY WIFE'S FRIENDS HE SMILED STILL MORE PLEASANTLY
AND ON THE TWENTY SIXTH ATTACKED THE WHOLE RUSSIAN ARMY WHICH WAS IN POSITION ON THE FIELD OF BORODINO SO THE HISTORIES SAY AND IT IS ALL QUITE WRONG AS ANYONE WHO CARES TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER CAN EASILY CONVINCE HIMSELF
OF COURSE YOU KNOW DMITRI SERGEEVICH
NAPOLEON RODE UP THE HIGH GROUND AT SEMENOVSK
AND THE BWETHWEN OH THEY SHOULD LET THAT FINE FELLOW BONAPARTE LOOSE HE'D KNOCK ALL THIS NONSENSE OUT OF THEM FANCY GIVING THE COMMAND OF THE SEMENOV WEGIMENT TO A FELLOW LIKE THAT SCHWA'TZ HE CRIED
BUT HERE WAS A FAIRY FOREST WITH BLACK MOVING SHADOWS AND A GLITTER OF DIAMONDS AND A FLIGHT OF MARBLE STEPS AND THE SILVER ROOFS OF FAIRY BUILDINGS AND THE SHRILL YELLS OF SOME ANIMALS
THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD DISAPPEARED HALF AN HOUR LATER THERE APPEARED AMONG THE OTHER MUMMERS IN THE BALLROOM AN OLD LADY IN A HOOPED SKIRT THIS WAS NICHOLAS A TURKISH GIRL
AND TI TI ONCE MORE AT THE SAME TIME HE FELT THAT ABOVE HIS FACE ABOVE THE VERY MIDDLE OF IT SOME STRANGE AIRY STRUCTURE WAS BEING ERECTED OUT OF SLENDER NEEDLES OR SPLINTERS
HIS PLUMP WHITE NECK STOOD OUT SHARPLY ABOVE THE BLACK COLLAR OF HIS UNIFORM AND HE SMELLED OF EAU DE COLOGNE HIS FULL FACE RATHER YOUNG LOOKING WITH ITS PROMINENT CHIN WORE A GRACIOUS AND MAJESTIC EXPRESSION
HAD HELENE HERSELF SHOWN THE LEAST SIGN OF HESITATION SHAME OR SECRECY HER CAUSE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN LOST BUT NOT ONLY DID SHE SHOW NO SIGNS OF SECRECY OR SHAME ON THE CONTRARY WITH GOOD NATURED NAIVETE SHE TOLD HER INTIMATE FRIENDS AND THESE WERE ALL PETERSBURG
ON ALL THE ESTATES BEFORE THE MASTER ARRIVED EVERYWHERE PREPARATIONS WERE MADE NOT FOR CEREMONIOUS WELCOMES WHICH HE KNEW PIERRE WOULD NOT LIKE BUT FOR JUST SUCH GRATEFULLY RELIGIOUS ONES
AND YET SO SIMILAR IN THAT THEY HAD BOTH LIVED AND BOTH DIED AND IN THE LOVE HE FELT FOR BOTH OF THEM PIERRE DROVE UP TO THE HOUSE OF THE OLD PRINCE IN A MOST SERIOUS MOOD THE HOUSE HAD ESCAPED THE FIRE IT SHOWED SIGNS OF DAMAGE BUT ITS GENERAL ASPECT WAS UNCHANGED THE OLD FOOTMAN
AND SO FAR SUCCEEDED THAT NICHOLAS RECEIVED A PROMISE FROM HIS MOTHER THAT SONYA SHOULD NOT BE TROUBLED WHILE HE ON HIS SIDE PROMISED NOT TO UNDERTAKE ANYTHING WITHOUT HIS PARENTS KNOWLEDGE
AND AT THE SAME TIME TO CONSOLE HIM SO SHE SAID NOW ABOUT YOUR FAMILY DO YOU KNOW THAT SINCE YOUR DAUGHTER CAME OUT EVERYONE HAS BEEN ENRAPTURED BY HER
AND THE DEATH OF HELENE ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER KUTUZOV'S REPORT A COUNTRY GENTLEMAN ARRIVED FROM MOSCOW AND NEWS OF THE SURRENDER OF MOSCOW TO THE FRENCH SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE TOWN THIS WAS TERRIBLE WHAT A POSITION FOR THE EMPEROR TO BE IN
WHEN PRINCESS MARY ENTERED HE HURRIEDLY TOOK A PINCH OF SNUFF AH MY DEAR MY DEAR HE BEGAN RISING AND TAKING HER BY BOTH HANDS THEN SIGHING HE ADDED MY SON'S FATE IS IN YOUR HANDS
THEY DID NOT ANSWER BUT BEGAN TO LAUGH
COULD STILL BE HEARD FOR A LONG TIME NATASHA LISTENED ATTENTIVELY TO THE SOUNDS THAT REACHED HER FROM INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE ROOM AND DID NOT MOVE FIRST SHE HEARD HER MOTHER PRAYING AND SIGHING AND THE CREAKING OF HER BED UNDER HER
BLACK EYEBROWS AND RED LIPS SHE RANG FOR HER MAID AND ASKED HER TO SLEEP IN HER ROOM
WITH GOD SAID BAGRATION IN A RESOLUTE SONOROUS VOICE TURNING FOR A MOMENT TO THE FRONT LINE AND SLIGHTLY SWINGING HIS ARMS HE WENT FORWARD UNEASILY OVER THE ROUGH FIELD WITH THE AWKWARD GAIT OF A CAVALRYMAN
AND HAD AN ENORMOUS FORTUNE HAD AGAINST HIS WILL MORE THAN ONCE ENTERED HIS HEAD FOR HIMSELF PERSONALLY NICHOLAS COULD NOT WISH FOR A BETTER WIFE BY MARRYING HER HE WOULD MAKE THE COUNTESS HIS MOTHER HAPPY WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT HIS FATHER'S AFFAIRS IN ORDER
AND YET WHAT A SPLENDID REIGN
POSSESSING IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE THE FACULTY OF DIVINING THE NEEDS AND INSTINCTS OF THOSE HE DEALT WITH HAVING GLANCED AT DRON HE AT ONCE UNDERSTOOD THAT HIS ANSWERS DID NOT EXPRESS HIS PERSONAL VIEWS BUT THE GENERAL MOOD OF THE BOGUCHAROVO COMMUNE
AND SURROUNDED THEM PIERRE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT HE ONLY REMEMBERED BEATING SOMEONE AND BEING BEATEN AND FINALLY FEELING THAT HIS HANDS WERE BOUND AND THAT A CROWD OF FRENCH SOLDIERS STOOD AROUND HIM AND WERE SEARCHING HIM
THE PEASANTS IN THE CROWD WERE SIMILARLY IMPRESSED WHEN THEY SAW ROSTOV'S RAPID FIRM STEPS AND RESOLUTE FROWNING FACE AFTER THE HUSSARS HAD COME TO THE VILLAGE AND ROSTOV HAD GONE TO SEE THE PRINCESS A CERTAIN CONFUSION AND DISSENSION HAD ARISEN AMONG THE CROWD
ANATOLE STOPPED HIM DON'T TOUCH HIM YOU'LL STARTLE HIM AND THEN HE'LL BE KILLED EH WHAT THEN EH
THE OLD PRINCE REMEMBERED HIS SON'S LETTER THERE WAS A LETTER FROM PRINCE ANDREW TODAY HE SAID TO PRINCESS MARY HAVEN'T YOU READ IT NO FATHER SHE REPLIED IN A FRIGHTENED VOICE
BAGRATION ALONE IS A MILITARY MAN HE'S STUPID BUT HE HAS EXPERIENCE A QUICK EYE AND RESOLUTION AND WHAT ROLE IS YOUR YOUNG MONARCH PLAYING IN THAT MONSTROUS CROWD THEY COMPROMISE HIM AND THROW ON HIM THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THAT HAPPENS
INSTEAD OF BLACK GLOSSY BEES TAMED BY TOIL CLINGING TO ONE ANOTHER'S LEGS AND DRAWING OUT THE WAX WITH A CEASELESS HUM OF LABOR THAT USED TO HANG
THAT'S WHERE ONE CROSSES THE KOLOCHA YOU SEE DOWN THERE WHERE THE ROWS OF HAY ARE LYING IN THE HOLLOW THERE'S THE BRIDGE THAT'S OUR CENTER OUR RIGHT FLANK IS OVER THERE HE POINTED SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT FAR AWAY IN THE BROKEN GROUND
IT WAS REGARDED AS A MODEL OF ECCLESIASTICAL PATRIOTIC ELOQUENCE
LAID HIS WELL GLOVED HAND ON THE EDGE OF HER BOX NODDED TO HER AND LEANING FORWARD ASKED A QUESTION WITH A MOTION TOWARD NATASHA MAIS CHARMANTE SAID HE EVIDENTLY REFERRING TO NATASHA
BUT CONTRADICT THEMSELVES PEASANTS HAVING NO CLEAR IDEA OF THE CAUSE OF RAIN SAY ACCORDING TO WHETHER THEY WANT RAIN OR FINE WEATHER THE WIND HAS BLOWN THE CLOUDS AWAY OR THE WIND HAS BROUGHT UP THE CLOUDS
ALL HE KNEW WAS THAT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ACTION BALLS AND SHELLS BEGAN FLYING ALL OVER HIS REGIMENT AND HITTING MEN AND THAT AFTERWARDS SOMEONE HAD SHOUTED CAVALRY AND OUR MEN HAD BEGUN FIRING THEY WERE STILL FIRING
SOME TALKED ABOUT THE MOSCOW MILITIA WHICH PRECEDED BY THE CLERGY WOULD GO TO THE THREE HILLS OTHERS WHISPERED THAT AUGUSTIN HAD BEEN FORBIDDEN TO LEAVE
TO WHAT COMMITTEE HAS THE MEMORANDUM BEEN REFERRED INQUIRED PRINCE ANDREW TO THE COMMITTEE ON ARMY REGULATIONS AND I HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT YOUR HONOR SHOULD BE APPOINTED A MEMBER BUT WITHOUT A SALARY PRINCE ANDREW SMILED I DON'T WANT ONE
INFORMED THE COUNT THAT AN IMMENSE CROWD HAD COLLECTED IN THE COURTYARD AND WISHED TO SEE HIM WITHOUT SAYING A WORD ROSTOPCHIN ROSE AND WALKED HASTILY TO HIS LIGHT LUXURIOUS DRAWING ROOM
BECAUSE ON THAT FACE WHOSE EYES HAD ALWAYS SHONE WITH A SUPPRESSED SMILE OF THE JOY OF LIFE NOW WHEN HE FIRST ENTERED AND GLANCED AT HER THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST SHADOW OF A SMILE ONLY HER EYES WERE KINDLY ATTENTIVE AND SADLY INTERROGATIVE
PLEASE GO AWAY MADAM AT THAT MOMENT A MAID SENT BY THE COUNTESS WHO HAD NOTICED HER DAUGHTER'S ABSENCE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR LIKE A SOMNAMBULIST
BUT AUSTRIA NEVER HAS WISHED AND DOES NOT WISH FOR WAR SHE IS BETRAYING US RUSSIA ALONE MUST SAVE EUROPE OUR GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN RECOGNIZES HIS HIGH VOCATION AND WILL BE TRUE TO IT THAT IS THE ONE THING I HAVE FAITH IN
WHAT WAS HAPPENING WE KEPT WETWEATING AND WETWEATING DID YOU TAKE PART IN THE CAMPAIGN HE ASKED I HAD THE PLEASURE REPLIED PRINCE ANDREW NOT ONLY OF TAKING PART IN THE RETREAT BUT OF LOSING IN THAT RETREAT ALL I HELD DEAR
NAPOLEON ROSE AND HAVING SUMMONED CAULAINCOURT
I'LL DO THE SAME THING HE SUDDENLY CRIED EVEN WITHOUT A BET THERE TELL THEM TO BRING ME A BOTTLE I'LL DO IT BRING A BOTTLE LET HIM DO IT LET HIM DO IT SAID DOLOKHOV SMILING WHAT NEXT HAVE YOU GONE MAD NO ONE WOULD LET YOU WHY
HE HAS TAKEN IT BETTER FAR BETTER THAN I EXPECTED EVIDENTLY IT HAD TO BE BUT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL IS REALLY ENDED ASKED PIERRE PRINCESS MARY LOOKED AT HIM WITH ASTONISHMENT
OF ALL THE BLIND TOOLS OF HISTORY WERE THE MOST ENSLAVED AND INVOLUNTARY THE ANCIENTS HAVE LEFT US MODEL HEROIC POEMS IN WHICH THE HEROES FURNISH THE WHOLE INTEREST OF THE STORY
THE NOTE QUIETLY AND THANKED HER IF THE COUNT HAD BEEN AT HOME MAVRA KUZMINICHNA WENT ON APOLOGETICALLY CHRIST BE WITH YOU SIR MAY GOD PRESERVE YOU SAID SHE
AND RATHER VAINGLORIOUS AND AMBITIOUS ACTIVITY
AND HAD SINCE FILLED THAT POST IRREPROACHABLY FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS THE PEASANTS FEARED HIM MORE THAN THEY DID THEIR MASTER THE MASTERS BOTH THE OLD PRINCE AND THE YOUNG AND THE STEWARD RESPECTED HIM AND JESTINGLY CALLED HIM THE MINISTER
AND SAT DOWN IN THE LADY'S CHAIR PLACING HIS HUGE HANDS SYMMETRICALLY ON HIS KNEES IN THE NAIVE ATTITUDE OF AN EGYPTIAN STATUE AND DECIDED IN HIS OWN MIND THAT ALL WAS AS IT SHOULD BE
HE MEANT TO FORTIFY THAT KNOLL QUITE DIFFERENTLY BUT
ONE OF THE PRINCE'S FAVORITE OCCUPATIONS OF LATE HAD BEEN THE PREPARATION OF SOME PAPERS HE MEANT TO LEAVE AT HIS DEATH AND WHICH HE CALLED HIS WILL
WHAT THE RESULT MUST BE WAS QUITE OBVIOUS AND YET NAPOLEON OFFERED AND KUTUZOV ACCEPTED THAT BATTLE IF THE COMMANDERS HAD BEEN GUIDED BY REASON IT WOULD SEEM THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS TO NAPOLEON
OF THE CAUSE OF HER SADNESS AND BECAUSE SHE WAS FEELING WELL SHE WAS ALSO HAPPY BECAUSE SHE HAD SOMEONE TO ADORE HER THE ADORATION OF OTHERS WAS A LUBRICANT THE WHEELS OF HER MACHINE NEEDED
AGAIN NAPOLEON BROUGHT OUT HIS SNUFFBOX PACED SEVERAL TIMES UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN SILENCE
NOT YET KNOWING WHOM NATASHA MEANT BY HIM NICHOLAS OR PRINCE ANDREW BUT WHY SHOULDN'T I SAY I SAW SOMETHING OTHERS DO SEE BESIDES WHO CAN TELL WHETHER I SAW ANYTHING OR NOT FLASHED THROUGH SONYA'S MIND
THE NEWS THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE ATTACKING THE LEFT FLANK OF THE FRENCH ARMY AROUSED THAT HORROR IN NAPOLEON HE SAT SILENTLY ON A CAMPSTOOL BELOW THE KNOLL WITH HEAD BOWED AND ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES
TO KEEP ONE ANOTHER BACK TO BREATHE IN THAT STIFLING ATMOSPHERE TO BE UNABLE TO STIR AND TO AWAIT SOMETHING UNKNOWN UNCOMPREHENDED AND TERRIBLE WAS BECOMING UNBEARABLE
ASKED PIERRE THAT IS FOR ME TO KNOW BUT NOT FOR YOU TO ASK SHOUTED ROSTOPCHIN IF HE IS ACCUSED OF CIRCULATING NAPOLEON'S PROCLAMATION IT IS NOT PROVED THAT HE DID SO SAID PIERRE WITHOUT LOOKING AT ROSTOPCHIN
HAD SUDDENLY TAKEN A VERY LARGE DOSE OF THE DRUG AND HAD DIED IN AGONY BEFORE ASSISTANCE COULD BE RENDERED HER IT WAS SAID THAT PRINCE VASILI AND THE OLD COUNT HAD TURNED UPON THE ITALIAN BUT THE LATTER HAD PRODUCED SUCH LETTERS FROM THE UNFORTUNATE DECEASED THAT THEY HAD IMMEDIATELY LET THE MATTER DROP
AND WHAT HAVE THEY PROMISED NOTHING AND WHAT LITTLE THEY HAVE PROMISED THEY WILL NOT PERFORM PRUSSIA HAS ALWAYS DECLARED THAT BUONAPARTE IS INVINCIBLE AND THAT ALL EUROPE IS POWERLESS BEFORE HIM
WHY AND HOW WERE THE BATTLES OF SHEVARDINO AND BORODINO GIVEN AND ACCEPTED WHY WAS THE BATTLE OF BORODINO FOUGHT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST SENSE IN IT FOR EITHER THE FRENCH OR THE RUSSIANS ITS IMMEDIATE RESULT FOR THE RUSSIANS WAS AND WAS BOUND TO BE
THE TURKS WILL BE OF NO USE TO YOU THEY ARE WORTH NOTHING AND HAVE SHOWN IT BY MAKING PEACE WITH YOU
THRUST OUT FROM UNDER THE QUILT WAS GROWING COLD ON THE BARE FLOOR AS IF TO CELEBRATE A VICTORY OVER EVERYBODY A CRICKET CHIRPED IN A CRACK IN THE WALL A COCK CROWED FAR OFF AND ANOTHER REPLIED NEAR BY
ALL THE CUNNINGLY DEVISED ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH THESE HISTORIES ARE FILLED ADMITTING THAT NATIONS ARE GOVERNED BY SOME UNDEFINED FORCE CALLED AN IDEA HISTORY'S ESSENTIAL QUESTION STILL REMAINS UNANSWERED
WERE SO STRONG THAT HE COULD NOT RESIST THEM AGAIN WHOLE DAYS WEEKS AND MONTHS OF HIS LIFE PASSED IN AS GREAT A RUSH AND WERE AS MUCH OCCUPIED WITH EVENING PARTIES DINNERS LUNCHES AND BALLS
AGAIN LOWERED HIS EYES YOU DROP THIS NONSENSE AND TELL THE PEOPLE TO GET READY TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AND GO TO MOSCOW
PRINCESS YUSUPOVA WORE ONE EXACTLY LIKE THIS SAID BERG POINTING TO THE FICHU WITH A HAPPY AND KINDLY SMILE JUST THEN COUNT BEZUKHOV WAS ANNOUNCED
THAT GOD WILL NOT FORSAKE HIM HE WILL FULFILL HIS VOCATION AND CRUSH THE HYDRA OF REVOLUTION WHICH HAS BECOME MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER IN THE PERSON OF THIS MURDERER AND VILLAIN WE ALONE MUST AVENGE THE BLOOD OF THE JUST ONE
AS HE HAD ENDED A PREVIOUS CAMPAIGN BY OCCUPYING VIENNA THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY NAPOLEON'S HISTORIANS THEMSELVES TELL US THAT FROM SMOLENSK ONWARDS HE WISHED TO STOP
MORE ESPECIALLY OF THE FEMININE SOCIETY
SO NATASHA TRIED TO SOLVE WHAT WAS TORTURING HER BY HERSELF AM I SPOILED FOR ANDREW'S LOVE OR NOT SHE ASKED HERSELF AND WITH SOOTHING IRONY REPLIED WHAT A FOOL I AM TO ASK THAT WHAT DID HAPPEN TO ME NOTHING
AND SHOULD FASCINATE HER HUSBAND AS MUCH AS SHE DID BEFORE HE BECAME HER HUSBAND NATASHA ON THE CONTRARY HAD AT ONCE ABANDONED ALL HER WITCHERY OF WHICH HER SINGING HAD BEEN AN UNUSUALLY POWERFUL PART
AN OLD CROSS LOOKING FOOTMAN CAME AND ANNOUNCED TO THE ROSTOVS THAT THE PRINCE WAS NOT RECEIVING BUT THAT THE PRINCESS BEGGED THEM TO WALK UP
NOW SUDDENLY SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS AND WINCING AND NOW SMILING HAPPILY HE WAS THINKING OF PRINCE ANDREW OF NATASHA AND OF THEIR LOVE AT ONE MOMENT JEALOUS OF HER PAST THEN REPROACHING HIMSELF FOR THAT FEELING
THEY DIFFERED FROM THEM IN SPEECH DRESS AND DISPOSITION THEY WERE CALLED STEPPE PEASANTS THE OLD PRINCE USED TO APPROVE OF THEM FOR THEIR ENDURANCE AT WORK WHEN THEY CAME TO BALD HILLS TO HELP WITH THE HARVEST OR TO DIG PONDS AND DITCHES
AND THAT THEY OUGHT TO GET AWAY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND SAVE THEIR BELONGINGS IT WAS FELT THAT EVERYTHING WOULD SUDDENLY BREAK UP AND CHANGE BUT UP TO THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER NOTHING HAD DONE SO
HAVE I NOT FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEEN DOING EVERYTHING TO OBTAIN IT
NOR ANYTHING ELSE COULD SEEM OF IMPORTANCE TO NATASHA THE COUNT RETURNED AND LAY DOWN BEHIND THE PARTITION THE COUNTESS WENT UP TO HER DAUGHTER AND TOUCHED HER HEAD WITH THE BACK OF HER HAND AS SHE WAS WONT TO DO WHEN NATASHA WAS ILL
THEY DESIRE TO SERVE NOT SPARING THEIR LIVES AND IT IS NOT ANY KIND OF RIOT
THE WHOLE PURPORT OF HIS REMARKS NOW WAS EVIDENTLY TO EXALT HIMSELF AND INSULT ALEXANDER
EVERYBODY WAS CELEBRATING THE VICTORY EVERYTHING WAS BUBBLING WITH LIFE IN THE RUINED BUT REVIVING CITY EVERYONE WAS PLEASED TO SEE PIERRE EVERYONE WISHED TO MEET HIM AND EVERYONE QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT WHAT HE HAD SEEN PIERRE FELT PARTICULARLY WELL DISPOSED TOWARD THEM ALL
CARE WILL BE TAKEN OF THAT GENTLEMAN I HOPE ADDED MADAME
A MOMENT LATER THE LADS ASCENDED THE STAIRS BENDING BENEATH THEIR BURDEN D'ARTAGNAN SENT THEM OFF TO THEIR GARRETS CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR AND ADDRESSING PLANCHET
AND TO DESIRE THAT WHEN HE DID HE SHOULD BE SHOWN UP TO HIM IMMEDIATELY HE AFTERWARDS PRESERVED SO PROFOUND A SILENCE THAT CROPOLE WAS ALMOST OFFENDED SO MUCH DID HE PREFER PEOPLE WHO WERE GOOD COMPANY
LET HIM BE CALLED BACK EXCLAIMED HE THE VALET WAS ABOUT TO EXECUTE THE ORDER WHEN THE KING STOPPED HIM NO SAID HE NO I SEE THE WHOLE SCHEME OF THAT MAN
LOOK OVER OUR HEADS WELL SINCE YOU CAN READ SO WELL IN MY EYES TELL ME WHAT I AM THINKING ABOUT MONTALAIS IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU DON'T THINK MONSIEUR RAOUL YOU THINK MY DEAR RAOUL OH NEVER BLUSH FOR SUCH A TRIFLE AS THAT
SAID MADEMOISELLE DE MONTALAIS TAKING HER PLACE AGAIN MADAME WILL BREAKFAST VERY WELL WITHOUT ME OH MONTALAIS YOU WILL BE PUNISHED
ONCE FORTUNATE THEY LOOK UPON ME NO MORE
LOUDER THAN ALL THE REST LIKE A MADMAN COLBERT'S BROW GREW DARK AND WRINKLED A KIND OF AMBITIOUS GLORY WHICH HAD LIGHTED HIS FACE WAS EXTINGUISHED LIKE THE LIGHT OF GLOW WORMS WE CRUSH BENEATH THE GRASS
AND WITH THESE WORDS WHICH HE FINISHED SHARPLY WITH A NERVOUS AND TERRIBLE LAUGH THE YOUNG MAN GIRDED ON HIS SWORD TOOK HIS HAT FROM THE TRUNK
VERY WELL BUT WILL MONSIEUR KEEP ALL THE APARTMENTS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOU WHY SHOULD I REQUIRE LESS TO DAY THAN YESTERDAY BECAUSE MONSIEUR YOUR LORDSHIP WILL PERMIT ME TO SAY
THE KING THEN DESCENDED AND WENT HIMSELF TO SEE THE BARRELS OF SPECIE IN GOLD AND SILVER WHICH UNDER THE DIRECTION OF COLBERT FOUR MEN HAD JUST ROLLED INTO A CELLAR
NEVERTHELESS I HOPE THAT YOUR MAJESTY WILL LISTEN TO THE FACTS AND NEWS WITH SOME FAVOR SPEAK MONSIEUR IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN SIRE YOUR MAJESTY SPOKE A GREAT DEAL AT BLOIS OF THE EMBARRASSED STATE IN WHICH THE AFFAIRS OF ENGLAND ARE
HE ARRIVES JUST AT THE PROPER MOMENT COME IN COME IN I IMPLORE YOU
NEVERTHELESS I MADE IT A CONDITION OF THE BARGAIN THAT IF MONSIEUR WISHED TO KEEP HIS DIAMOND IT SHOULD BE HELD TILL MONSIEUR WAS AGAIN IN FUNDS OH NO NOT AT ALL I TOLD YOU TO SELL IT
HE TURNED HALF ROUND THEREFORE AND WHILE CONTINUING HIS CONVERSATION WITH THE QUEEN FACED THE KING YOU KNOW MONSIEUR FOUQUET SAID LOUIS
HAS DELIBERATED IN THE ABSENCE OF THE ACCUSED AND THAT THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS COMPLETE WHEN THEY WERE ARRESTED WHAT ARE THEY THEN ARRESTED NO DOUBT THEY ARE
BEGAN TO BARK FORMIDABLY AS SOON AS THE STRANGER'S STEPS WERE AUDIBLE BENEATH THE WINDOWS BUT THE WATCHFULNESS INSTEAD OF ALARMING THE NEWLY LANDED MAN APPEARED ON THE CONTRARY TO GIVE HIM GREAT JOY
WELL NEVER WANT MY BOY
GRACIOUSLY LOOKING THROUGH HIS FINGERS AT THE HOLY GHOST GARTER AND GOLDEN FLEECE BUT MORE PARTICULARLY AT THE FACE OF THE MESSENGER I AM NOT AN ENGLISHMAN BUT A FRENCHMAN MONSIEUR LE CARDINAL
SAID HE TO THE FOOTMAN YOU ARE RIGHT GOURVILLE TWO MINUTES AFTER THE ABBE FOUQUET APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY WITH PROFOUND REVERENCE HE WAS A MAN OF FROM FORTY TO FORTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE HALF CHURCHMAN HALF SOLDIER A SPADASSIN GRAFTED UPON AN ABBE
AND PASSED THE BLADE THROUGH HIS BODY I TOLD YOU PLAINLY TO KEEP YOURSELF QUIET
THE ORDONNANCE SHALL APPEAR SIRE I THANK YOU IS THAT ALL YOU ASK NO SIRE ONE THING MORE WHAT IS THAT ALLOW ME TO COMPOSE A CHAMBER OF JUSTICE
THEY ARE NOT TO BE CONDEMNED BY A PARLIAMENT GOD IS THEIR JUDGE THIS FRENCH GENTLEMAN THEN FORMED THE IDEA OF GAINING POSSESSION OF THE PERSON OF MONK AND HE EXECUTED HIS PLAN
CONTAINS THE REVELATION OF HIS WISHES
A BREVET OF THE FLEECE IN BLANK
DO YOU THINK SO HE WILL CRUSH ME IN A WEEK SIRE
MINE MONSIEUR ARE THE CORRECT ONES I DO NOT SAY THAT THEY ARE NOT AND YOU HAVE ACCEPTED WHAT WAS NOT DUE TO YOU D'ARTAGNAN'S EYES FLASHED
THE UNKNOWN HIMSELF SHUT THE DOOR AFTER HIM AND WHEN LEFT ALONE LOOKED MOURNFULLY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PURSE FROM WHICH HE HAD TAKEN A SMALL SILKEN BAG CONTAINING THE DIAMOND HIS LAST RESOURCE HE DWELT LIKEWISE UPON THE EMPTINESS OF HIS POCKETS
AND SAID MONSIEUR WE ARE HERE ALL SAID FOUQUET YES COUNT THE SUPERINTENDENT COUNTED THERE WERE EIGHT PERSONS
DEMANDS AN ALLIANCE BETWEEN MONSIEUR THE BROTHER OF THE KING AND MADEMOISELLE
A CONSPIRATOR A REAL CONSPIRATOR
THIS WAS A MATTER FOR GRAVE CONSIDERATION AT ALL EVENTS THE MOMENT WAS BADLY CHOSEN TO SEND D'ARTAGNAN AWAY
BUT STILL MORE THE MOST ABSOLUTE DEVOTION AND THAT BELIEVE ME WITH ME SIRE MEANS SOMETHING NOW HEARING YOUR MAJESTY COMPLAIN OF FATE I FOUND THAT YOU WERE NOBLE AND GENEROUS AND BORE MISFORTUNE WELL
HE PLACED ON DUTY AT THIS POINT TWO HUNDRED SWISS WHO DID NOT SPEAK A WORD OF FRENCH WITH ORDERS TO ADMIT ALL WHO CARRIED PACKAGES BUT NO OTHERS AND BY NO MEANS TO ALLOW ANY ONE TO GO OUT
HAVE YOU UNDERSTOOD ME PERFECTLY WELL HOW MUCH WILL IT AMOUNT TO TO MAKE YOUR BANDITS ALL DRUNK WITH WINE AND TO SATISFY THEM WITH GOLD OH MONSIEUR WHAT AN EXPRESSION OH MONSIEUR IF THEY HEARD YOU SOME OF THEM ARE VERY SUSCEPTIBLE
TO WHOM THE LITTLE MALICIOUS THRUST DIRECTED AGAINST ANNE OF AUSTRIA HAD RESTORED ENERGY AND GAYETY
THE KING BECAME ANIMATED AT THE RECITAL OF GREAT ACTIONS THE KING'S YOUNGER BROTHER STRUCK THE TABLE WITH HIS HAND
AT THIS SIGNAL EIGHT GUARDS WHO WERE LOUNGING IN THE SUN IN THE SQUARE COURT RAN TO THEIR HALBERTS AND MONSIEUR MADE HIS SOLEMN ENTRY INTO THE CASTLE WHEN HE HAD DISAPPEARED UNDER THE SHADES OF THE PORCH THREE OR FOUR IDLERS WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE CAVALCADE TO THE CASTLE
WITH ONE OF THOSE VOICES WHICH DOMINATE OVER CANNON THE SEA THE TEMPEST
THE AFFAIR ORIGINATED WITH FOUQUET DOES NOT EVERYBODY KNOW THAT THE CONDEMNED WERE HIS FRIENDS FROM CHILDHOOD THAT IS TRUE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN AND THUS ARE ALL MY DOUBTS CLEARED UP I REPEAT IT
AH GOURVILLE THAT IS A VILE JOKE THIS IS NOT THE PLACE MONSEIGNEUR DO NOT BE ANGRY
THEY PIERCE WITH ITS POINT STRIKE WITH THE FLAT CUT WITH THE EDGE EVERY STROKE BRINGS DOWN A MAN
HE THRUST HIS PAPERS INTO HIS PORTFOLIO AND GIVING A GLANCE AT THE MIRROR WHILST THE TAPS CONTINUED FASTER THAN EVER OH OH SAID HE WHENCE COMES ALL THIS RACKET WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHO CAN THE ARIADNE BE WHO EXPECTS ME SO IMPATIENTLY LET US SEE
SAID HE IN A FRETFUL VOICE WHILST PUTTING ON BEHIND THE CURTAIN HIS DRESSING GOWN
THAT WITHOUT AN ARMY AND WITHOUT A MILLION I HAVE DONE I MYSELF WHAT YOUR MAJESTY THOUGHT COULD ALONE BE DONE WITH AN ARMY AND A MILLION
WHISPERED MONSIEUR THE DIAMOND HAS BEEN VALUED AH SAID THE TRAVELER WELL WELL MONSIEUR THE JEWELER OF S A R GIVES TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PISTOLES FOR IT HAVE YOU THEM I THOUGHT IT BEST TO TAKE THEM MONSIEUR
HERE IT IS MONSIEUR READ IT
CRYING WITH THE MINORITY WHICH HAD BECOME THANKS TO THEM THE MOST COMPACT MAJORITY YES YES TO THE FIRE WITH THE THIEVES VIVE COLBERT MORDIOUX EXCLAIMED D'ARTAGNAN THIS BEGINS TO LOOK SERIOUS
AND HE SIGHED
GO TO PARIS THEN PELISSON SAID FOUQUET AND BRING HITHER THE TWO VICTIMS TO MORROW WE SHALL SEE
THEN GIVE ME YOUR PURSE GOURVILLE
IT IS I THAT PAY GOURVILLE AND I KNOW MY FIGURES GOURVILLE LAUGHED IN A SILENT SLY MANNER
THE WHOLE EVEN OF WHICH I HAVE EARNED I SEE NO IMPEDIMENT TO THAT MONSEIGNEUR I FELT ASSURED THAT IN CONSULTING YOU COLBERT I SHOULD HAVE GOOD ADVICE REPLIED MAZARIN GREATLY DELIGHTED COLBERT RESUMED HIS PEDANTIC LOOK
GREAT FOOLS MUST THEY BE WHO THINK THEY HAVE ANYTHING TO TEACH YOU BUT ARE WE NOT AT THE RUE SAINT HONORE YES DEAR ATHOS LOOK YONDER ON THE LEFT THAT SMALL LONG WHITE HOUSE IS THE HOTEL WHERE I LODGE
IN NOT HAVING SHOWN SOME RESPECT FOR A VERY OLD AND SUFFERING MAN WHO HAS LABORED MUCH DURING HIS LIFE
WELL SAID HE I SEE HOW IT IS LET US BE MEN IT IS ALL OVER IS IT NOT THE PRINCIPAL THING IS MONSIEUR THAT YOUR LIFE IS SAFE DOUBTLESS DOUBTLESS LIFE IS SOMETHING BUT I AM RUINED
ACCEPT MY SON ACCEPT SAID ANNE OF AUSTRIA YOU ARE ABOVE REPORTS AND INTERPRETATIONS REFUSE SIRE SAID FOUQUET AS LONG AS A KING LIVES HE HAS NO OTHER MEASURE BUT HIS CONSCIENCE
BUT IF HE SHOULD ROB YOU OF IT AH THAT IS ANOTHER THING UNFORTUNATELY BEFORE HE CAN REACH ME THAT IS TO SAY THE BODY OF THE PLACE HE MUST DESTROY MUST MAKE A BREACH IN THE ADVANCED WORKS
FOR A DIAMOND WORTH A THOUSAND PISTOLES FOR A SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS AS MUCH BITTERNESS AS KINDNESS I SAVE HIS LIFE
SIRE I BEG YOU TO ALLOW ME TO SETTLE THIS MATTER MYSELF AND IF YOUR MAJESTY HAS NO FURTHER NEED OF MY SERVICES NO CHEVALIER WHAT
AS IF EACH ONE WAS OCCUPIED ABOUT SOMETHING WHILST LENDING ATTENTION REALLY ONLY TO ONE AMONGST THEM WHO HIMSELF
TO THE FIRE TO THE FIRE BURN THE THIEVES BURN THE EXTORTIONERS THIS CRY
OR SHALL I CONTINUE GIVE UP GIVE UP YOU ARE MAD YOU WOULD LOSE ALL YOU HAVE WON PESTE MY LORD
AND ALL THE DOMESTICS WITH A BUZZING LIKE THAT OF SEVERAL BEE HIVES SURROUNDED RAOUL FOR THE PURPOSE OF QUESTIONING HIM MADAME SAW THIS MOVEMENT
AND BENEATH THE MARBLE PORTICOES WITH THE DELIGHTFUL LIBERTY WHICH REVEALS IN THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE SO MUCH FORGETFULNESS OF GREATNESS
IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY COMMIT THE WRONG OF DYING COLBERT THAT IS TRUE MY LORD AGAINST WHOM HOWEVER DID THE THEATIN MAKE OUT THAT YOU HAD COMMITTED THESE WRONGS AGAINST THE KING
FROM TWO GREEK WORDS SIGNIFYING BEAUTIFUL ISLE THUS AT A DISTANCE OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED YEARS IT HAD BORNE IN ANOTHER IDIOM THE SAME NAME IT STILL BEARS
IN A SHORT QUERULOUS TONE YES MONSEIGNEUR AND THE WORD MONSEIGNEUR CAME SO PAINFULLY FROM THE LIPS OF ATHOS THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID IT SKINNED THEM
WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT HE WHO WAS ONLY AT PRESENT A RATHER POOR STAR IN THE HEAVEN OF ROYALTY WOULD ONE DAY MAKE THAT STAR HIS EMBLEM
WILL YOU GUARANTEE THEIR AUTHENTICITY MONSIEUR ALL THE MORE EASILY MY LORD CARDINAL FROM HAVING SEEN THE EVENTS
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONLY ONE WHICH OPENED
WOULD LOSE ITS VALUE IT WOULD GAIN IN SECURITY CHOOSE YOUR COLLEAGUES
WHICH WOULD DIMINISH HIS EXPENSES AND EASE MY CONSCIENCE INDEED IT IS HARD TO INCREASE UNREASONABLY THE PRICE OF THE CHAMBERS WHEN ONE HAS HAD THE HONOR TO LET THEM AT A REASONABLE PRICE HOW MUCH DOES THE HIRE AMOUNT TO SINCE YESTERDAY
THE LITTLE BALCONY OF WROUGHT IRON WHICH ADVANCED IN FRONT OF THIS WINDOW WAS FURNISHED WITH A POT OF RED GILLIFLOWERS ANOTHER POT OF PRIMROSES AND AN EARLY ROSE TREE THE FOLIAGE OF WHICH BEAUTIFULLY GREEN WAS VARIEGATED WITH NUMEROUS RED SPECKS ANNOUNCING FUTURE ROSES
THE DEVIL IF MY BROTHER IS THERE MY AFFAIRS ARE BAD GOURVILLE
ONLY A LARGE DOG OF THE RACE OF THOSE WHICH THE FISHERMEN OF SCHEVENINGEN HARNESS TO LITTLE CARTS TO CARRY FISH TO THE HAGUE
THERE IS A KING GOD SPEED HIM
THAT IS BECAUSE YOUR EMINENCE ABSORBED AS YOU ARE BY YOUR DISEASE

THEY RETURNED TO THEIR OCCUPATIONS ONE ONLY OF THE CURIOUS PARTY A STOUT STUBBY CHEERFUL LAD HAVING DEMANDED HOW IT WAS THAT MONSIEUR WHO FROM HIS GREAT REVENUES HAD IT IN HIS POWER TO AMUSE HIMSELF SO MUCH BETTER
HE WILL DISMOUNT HIS MUSKETEERS BECAUSE OATS AND HAY OF A HORSE COST FIVE SOLS A DAY OH DO NOT SAY THAT
COLBERT RESUMED HIS PLACE AT MAZARIN'S PILLOW AT THE FIRST INTERVAL OF PAIN AND PERSUADED HIM TO DICTATE A DONATION THUS CONCEIVED ABOUT TO APPEAR BEFORE GOD THE MASTER OF MANKIND
AND HOW EVIDENT IT IS THAT YOU FEAR THE LEAST SUSPICION OF YOUR AMOURS TO ESCAPE
NO NO I MISTAKE THE SEA IS PERFIDIOUS
IS TO THROW YOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY MEN UPON THE PEOPLE I WILL POINT OUT TO YOU AT A CERTAIN MOMENT GIVEN IS IT POSSIBLE IT WILL NOT BE THE FIRST TIME SUCH A THING HAS HAPPENED TO THEM MONSEIGNEUR THAT IS WELL BUT WOULD THESE BANDITS ATTACK AN ARMED FORCE
THAT THIS MAN WITH A HEART OF BRONZE AND MUSCLES OF STEEL HAD LEFT HOUSE AND FRIENDS EVERYTHING IN SHORT TO GO IN SEARCH OF FORTUNE AND DEATH THE ONE THAT IS TO SAY DEATH HAD CONSTANTLY RETREATED BEFORE HIM AS IF AFRAID OF HIM
MY FRIEND I AM MOST ANXIOUS TO BE OFF AND WILL GO AT ONCE AND PAY MY RESPECTS TO THE KING

SAID THE YOUNG PRINCE JOYOUSLY AS HE CROSSED THE CHAMBER WITH HIS FAVORITE TO GO TO HIS CARRIAGE NO NEVER WHAT A WEIGHT THESE CROWNS ARE
ZEUS THAT IS ZEN TO LIVE
NOW ABBE IS EVERYTHING ARRANGED EVERYTHING AT TWO O'CLOCK TO MORROW AT TWELVE BECAUSE IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO PREPARE OUR AUXILIARIES IN A
GIVING HER HAND TO FOUQUET TO KISS AND WALKING TOWARDS THE DOOR WITH SO FIRM A STEP THAT HE DID NOT DARE TO BAR HER PASSAGE AS TO FOUQUET HE RETOOK WITH HIS HEAD HANGING DOWN AND A FIXED CLOUD ON HIS BROW THE PATH OF THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE ALONG WHICH RAN THE METAL WIRES THAT COMMUNICATED FROM ONE HOUSE TO THE OTHER
SOON THE CRIES OF THE VICTIMS SLAUGHTERED IN THE POULTRY YARD THE HASTY STEPS OF MADAME CROPOLE UP THAT LITTLE WOODEN STAIRCASE SO NARROW AND SO ECHOING THE BOUNDING PACE OF PITTRINO WHO ONLY THAT MORNING WAS SMOKING AT THE DOOR WITH ALL THE PHLEGM OF A DUTCHMAN
AND THE AFFAIR SEEMED SO PRESSING THAT I LEFT AT ONCE
TRIPLE FOOL REPLIED COLBERT FURIOUSLY SHAKING HIS HAIR THICK AND BLACK AS A MANE WHAT ARE YOU TELLING ME
PARRY IS THAT ALL IS THAT ALL YES MY LORD THAT IS ALL AFTER THIS BRIEF REPLY ENSUED A LONG INTERVAL OF SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE CONVULSIVE BEATING OF THE HEEL OF THE YOUNG MAN ON THE FLOOR
COVERED WITH AN OLD LARGE FLOWERED HAARLEM TAPESTRY IN THE CENTER OF THIS TABLE WAS A LONG NECKED STONE BOTTLE IN WHICH WERE IRISES AND LILIES OF THE VALLEY AT EACH END OF THIS TABLE WAS A YOUNG GIRL
CAN NO LONGER EXPECT TO WEAR A SMOOTH BROW A WRINKLE FOR EVERY HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVRES IS NOT TOO MUCH D'ARTAGNAN SHUT HIMSELF UP ATE NO DINNER CLOSED HIS DOOR TO EVERYBODY AND WITH A LIGHTED LAMP AND A LOADED PISTOL ON THE TABLE
AND THAT IS A GOOD ROUND SUM BUT THEN YOU WOULD BE EITHER A FOOL OR A TRAITOR AND I AM NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER MY LORD YOU APPEAR TO BE MUCH AFRAID THAT THE KING WILL ACCEPT
HE TOLD AS SO MANY FABULOUS EVENTS ALL THE HISTORY OF HIS PERIGRINATIONS IN SCOTLAND AND HIS TERRORS WHEN THE ENEMY'S PARTY WAS SO CLOSELY ON HIS TRACK
A FAVOR WHICH TREASURERS DO NOT GRANT TO EVERYBODY THEN IMPASSIBLE AND JUST AS POLITE AS HE OUGHT TO BE TOWARDS A MAN HONORED WITH THE FRIENDSHIP OF THE KING HE SAID TO D'ARTAGNAN TAKE AWAY YOUR MONEY SIR YOUR MONEY
WHAT ARE YOUR OWN PROPER DUTIES UNLESS TO WRITE TO THE HANDSOME RAOUL AND EVEN THAT YOU DON'T DO SO THAT IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF YOU LIKEWISE WERE RATHER NEGLIGENT OF YOUR DUTIES
YES WITHOUT DOUBT UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NEITHER THE GARDEN NOR THE FRIENDS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE RESEMBLANCE
SAID MONTALAIS BEWARE MY LAMB YOU ARE SCATTERING YOUR WOOL AND THERE ARE WOLVES ABOUT LOUISE WAS ABOUT TO REPLY WHEN THE GALLOP OF A HORSE RESOUNDED UNDER THE PORCH OF THE CASTLE WHAT IS THAT SAID MONTALAIS APPROACHING THE WINDOW
BUT IN THE LOWER HOUSE THE FEELING AGAINST THE JACOBITE PRIESTS WAS IRRESISTIBLY STRONG ON THE VERY DAY ON WHICH THAT HOUSE VOTED WITHOUT A DIVISION THE ADDRESS REQUESTING THE KING TO SUMMON THE CONVOCATION A CLAUSE WAS PROPOSED AND CARRIED
HE WAS ENTITLED TO HOSPITALITY TO TENDERNESS TO RESPECT IT WAS FIT THAT HE SHOULD HAVE A STATELY PALACE AND A SPACIOUS FOREST
MAY LAWFULLY WITHHOLD PAYMENT IF THE CREDITOR IS WILLING TO CANCEL THE OBLIGATION
THE DISAFFECTED WITS SOLVED THE DIFFICULTY BY SUGGESTING THAT THE ARTIST MEANT TO ALLUDE TO THAT CHARIOT WHICH A ROMAN PRINCESS LOST TO ALL FILIAL AFFECTION AND BLINDLY DEVOTED TO THE INTERESTS OF AN AMBITIOUS HUSBAND
THE BEST THING LOUVOIS WROTE THAT KING JAMES COULD DO WOULD BE TO FORGET THAT HE HAD REIGNED IN GREAT BRITAIN AND TO THINK ONLY OF PUTTING IRELAND INTO A GOOD CONDITION AND OF ESTABLISHING HIMSELF FIRMLY THERE WHETHER THIS WERE THE TRUE INTEREST OF THE HOUSE OF STUART MAY BE DOUBTED
UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD SEE REASON TO CALL ON HIM SPECIALLY FOR AN ASSURANCE OF HIS LOYALTY BURNETT HAD PARTLY NO DOUBT FROM THE GOODNATURE AND GENEROSITY WHICH BELONGED TO HIS CHARACTER AND PARTLY FROM A DESIRE TO CONCILIATE HIS BRETHREN
WOULD NOT NOW SATISFY EVEN ONE HALF OF THE NONCONFORMISTS AND IT WAS THE OBVIOUS INTEREST OF EVERY NONCONFORMIST WHOM NO CONCESSION WOULD SATISFY THAT NONE OF HIS BRETHREN SHOULD BE SATISFIED THE MORE LIBERAL THE TERMS OF COMPREHENSION
COULD PREVENT HIM FROM SPEEDILY DISCOVERING THAT HIS BROTHER OF ENGLAND WAS THE DULLEST AND MOST PERVERSE OF HUMAN BEINGS THE FOLLY OF JAMES HIS INCAPACITY TO READ THE CHARACTERS OF MEN AND THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES
IF THE GOVERNMENT ALLOWED HIM LESS THAN SUFFICED FOR HIS WANTS IT WAS NOT EXTREME TO MARK THE MEANS BY WHICH HE SUPPLIED THE DEFICIENCY THOUGH FOUR FIFTHS OF THE POPULATION OF IRELAND WERE CELTIC AND ROMAN CATHOLIC
THAT THE STATESMEN WHO FRAMED THE CORONATION OATH
OUGHT TO BE TRANSFERRED FROM THE CROWN TO THE ESTATES WHEN THE PLACE OF TREASURER
ON ALL POLITICAL AND LITERARY QUESTIONS THE MINISTER WAS THE ORACLE OF HIS OWN CIRCLE IT WAS POPULARLY REMARKED DURING MANY YEARS THAT AN EMINENT DISSENTING MINISTER HAD ONLY TO MAKE HIS SON AN ATTORNEY OR A PHYSICIAN
TWO GENERATIONS OF PUBLIC MEN HAVE SINCE LABOURED WITH IMPERFECT SUCCESS TO REPAIR THE ERROR WHICH WAS THEN COMMITTED NOR IS IT IMPROBABLE THAT SOME OF THE PENALTIES OF THAT ERROR MAY CONTINUE TO AFFLICT A REMOTE POSTERITY THE BILL BY WHICH THE OATH WAS SETTLED PASSED THE UPPER HOUSE WITHOUT AMENDMENT
THE DAY WAS WET AND STORMY THE ROAD WAS DEEP IN MIRE
ELIZABETH HAD BEEN SO WISE AS TO ABSTAIN FROM REQUIRING THE OBSERVANCE OF A FEW FORMS WHICH A LARGE PART OF HER SUBJECTS CONSIDERED AS POPISH SHE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE AVERTED THOSE FEARFUL CALAMITIES WHICH FORTY YEARS AFTER HER DEATH AFFLICTED THE CHURCH
IT APPEARED THAT THERE WAS A STRONG BODY OF CHURCHMEN WHO WERE DETERMINED NOT TO GIVE UP A SINGLE WORD OR FORM TO WHOM IT SEEMED THAT THE PRAYERS WERE NO PRAYERS WITHOUT THE SURPLICE THE BABE NO CHRISTIAN IF NOT MARKED WITH THE CROSS
WAS NEVER INTENDED TO TRAMMEL HIM IN HIS LEGISLATIVE CAPACITY LEAVE THAT OATH AS IT IS NOW DRAWN AND NO PRINCE CAN MISUNDERSTAND IT NO PRINCE CAN SERIOUSLY IMAGINE THAT THE TWO HOUSES MEAN TO EXACT FROM HIM A PROMISE THAT HE WILL PUT A VETO ON LAWS
THAT THE WEAPONS BY WHICH THE HIGHLANDERS COULD BE MOST EFFECTUALLY SUBDUED WERE THE PICKAXE AND THE SPADE THE COUNTRY WHICH LAY JUST ABOVE THIS PASS WAS NOW THE THEATRE OF A WAR SUCH AS THE HIGHLANDS HAD NOT OFTEN WITNESSED
IN THIS MEETING IT WAS DETERMINED THAT FOR THE FUTURE THE EJECTION OF THE ESTABLISHED CLERGY
IT WAS PLAIN FROM WHAT PASSED IN DEBATE THAT THOUGH THE CHIEFS OF THE CLUB HAD BEGUN WITH THE COURT OF SESSION THEY DID NOT MEAN TO END THERE THE ARGUMENTS USED BY SIR PATRICK HUME AND OTHERS
IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD BE LEFT UNARMED IN THE MIDST OF AN ARMED AND HOSTILE POPULATION A DAY WAS FIXED ON WHICH THEY WERE TO BRING ALL THEIR SWORDS AND FIRELOCKS TO THE PARISH CHURCHES AND IT WAS NOTIFIED
WERE CROWDED BEHIND THE BULWARKS OF THE CITY OF REFUGE THERE AT LENGTH ON THE VERGE OF THE OCEAN HUNTED TO THE LAST ASYLUM AND BAITED INTO A MOOD IN WHICH MEN MAY BE DESTROYED
PAINTED GLASS MUSIC HOLIDAYS FAST DAYS WERE NOT OF THE ESSENCE OF RELIGION WERE THE WINDOWS OF KING'S COLLEGE CHAPEL TO BE BROKEN AT THE DEMAND OF ONE SET OF FANATICS WAS THE ORGAN OF EXETER TO BE SILENCED TO PLEASE ANOTHER
THE DEFENCES OF LONDONDERRY APPEARED CONTEMPTIBLE
AND WERE IN STRENGTH AND COURAGE INFERIOR TO NO TRIBE IN THE MOUNTAINS BUT THE CLAN HAD BEEN MADE INSIGNIFICANT BY THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHIEF THE MARQUESS WAS THE FALSEST THE MOST FICKLE
THE PURITAN WHO WAS IN GENERAL BUT TOO READY TO FOLLOW PRECEDENTS AND ANALOGIES DRAWN FROM THE HISTORY AND JURISPRUDENCE OF THE JEWS MIGHT HAVE FOUND IN THE OLD TESTAMENT QUITE AS CLEAR WARRANT FOR KEEPING FESTIVALS IN HONOUR OF GREAT EVENTS
PERSONS WHOSE GRATITUDE MIGHT BE USEFUL IN THE EVENT OF A COUNTERREVOLUTION
ADAPTED TO THE WANTS THE FEELINGS AND THE PREJUDICES OF THE EXISTING GENERATION ACCORDINGLY WHILE THE TOLERATION BILL FOUND SUPPORT IN ALL QUARTERS THE COMPREHENSION BILL WAS ATTACKED FROM ALL QUARTERS
SO MUCH PROVOKED BY THEIR PERVERSENESS THAT AFTER LONG TEMPORISING HE REFUSED TO TOUCH EVEN ACTS WHICH WERE IN THEMSELVES UNOBJECTIONABLE AND TO WHICH HIS INSTRUCTIONS EMPOWERED HIM TO CONSENT
AND THE CHURCH STRENGTHENED BY A LARGE REINFORCEMENT IT WAS PLAIN THAT ALL CHANCE OF OBTAINING ANY RELAXATION OF THE TEST ACT WOULD BE AT AN END AND IT WAS BUT TOO PROBABLE THAT THE TOLERATION ACT MIGHT NOT LONG REMAIN UNREPEALED
JUST AT THIS MOMENT A GLIMPSE OF HOPE APPEARED ON THE FOURTEENTH OF APRIL SHIPS FROM ENGLAND ANCHORED IN THE BAY THEY HAD ON BOARD TWO REGIMENTS WHICH HAD BEEN SENT UNDER THE COMMAND OF A COLONEL NAMED CUNNINGHAM TO REINFORCE THE GARRISON
ANOTHER CLAUSE GRANTED SIMILAR INDULGENCE TO THE MEMBERS OF THE TWO UNIVERSITIES THEN IT WAS PROVIDED THAT ANY MINISTER WHO HAD BEEN ORDAINED AFTER THE PRESBYTERIAN FASHION MIGHT WITHOUT REORDINATION
THE TRAVELLERS HAD TO PASS SEVERAL FORDS WHERE THE WATER WAS BREAST HIGH SOME OF THE PARTY FAINTED FROM FATIGUE AND HUNGER ALL AROUND LAY A FRIGHTFUL WILDERNESS IN A JOURNEY OF FORTY MILES AVAUX COUNTED ONLY THREE MISERABLE CABINS EVERY THING ELSE WAS ROCK BOG AND MOOR
ALL THE PREPARATIONS WERE COMPLETE AND ON THE ELEVENTH OF APRIL THE CORONATION TOOK PLACE IN SOME THINGS IT DIFFERED FROM ORDINARY CORONATIONS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE ATTENDED THE CEREMONY IN A BODY AND WERE SUMPTUOUSLY FEASTED IN THE EXCHEQUER CHAMBER
THE MOST PUSILLANIMOUS OF MANKIND ALREADY IN THE SHORT SPACE OF SIX MONTHS HE HAD BEEN SEVERAL TIMES A JACOBITE AND SEVERAL TIMES A WILLIAMITE BOTH JACOBITES AND WILLIAMITES REGARDED HIM WITH CONTEMPT AND DISTRUST
THAT THE CRISIS REQUIRED PROMPT AND STRENUOUS EXERTION ON THE FATE OF BLAIR CASTLE PROBABLY DEPENDED THE FATE OF ALL ATHOL ON THE FATE OF ATHOL MIGHT DEPEND THE FATE OF SCOTLAND MACKAY HASTENED NORTHWARD
ONE OF THEM WAS COMMANDED BY LORD KENMORE THE OTHER WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED ON THE BORDER AND WHICH IS STILL STYLED THE KING'S OWN BORDERERS BY LORD LEVEN TWO TROOPS OF HORSE LORD ANNANDALE'S AND LORD BELHAVEN'S
THOSE WHO WERE HONOURED WITH AN INVITATION TO THE ROYAL TABLE
A CONJUNCTURE SINGULARLY AUSPICIOUS A CONJUNCTURE AT WHICH WISDOM AND JUSTICE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE RECONCILED RACES AND SECTS LONG HOSTILE AND MIGHT HAVE MADE THE BRITISH ISLANDS ONE TRULY UNITED KINGDOM WAS SUFFERED TO PASS AWAY THE OPPORTUNITY ONCE LOST RETURNED NO MORE
THE TWO BILLS HAD A COMMON ORIGIN AND TO A GREAT EXTENT A COMMON OBJECT THEY WERE FRAMED AT THE SAME TIME AND LAID ASIDE AT THE SAME TIME THEY SANK TOGETHER INTO OBLIVION
WERE LEFT IN RUINS WITHOUT ONE INHABITANT THE PEOPLE OF OMAGH DESTROYED THEIR OWN DWELLINGS SO UTTERLY THAT NO ROOF WAS LEFT TO SHELTER THE ENEMY FROM THE RAIN AND WIND THE PEOPLE OF CAVAN MIGRATED IN ONE BODY TO ENNISKILLEN
BUT THIS PROCLAMATION NOT BEING SUPPORTED BY TROOPS WAS VERY LITTLE REGARDED ON THE VERY DAY AFTER IT WAS PUBLISHED AT GLASGOW THE VENERABLE CATHEDRAL OF THAT CITY ALMOST THE ONLY FINE CHURCH OF THE MIDDLE AGES WHICH STANDS UNINJURED IN SCOTLAND
THE JOURNEY OF JAMES HAD BEEN UNDERTAKEN IN OPPOSITION TO THE UNANIMOUS SENSE OF THE IRISH AND HAD EXCITED GREAT ALARM AMONG THEM THEY APPREHENDED THAT HE MEANT TO QUIT THEM AND TO MAKE A DESCENT ON SCOTLAND THEY KNEW THAT ONCE LANDED IN GREAT BRITAIN
INCOMPETENT AS HE WAS HE BORE A COMMISSION WHICH GAVE HIM MILITARY RANK IN SCOTLAND NEXT TO DUNDEE
WHICH THE MOST CARELESS EYE COULD NOT DURING MANY YEARS FAIL TO DISCERN HIS ARMY WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A RABBLE SUCH AS KEATING HAD WELL COMPARED TO THE UNCLEAN BIRDS OF PREY WHICH SWARM WHEREVER THE SCENT OF CARRION IS STRONG
AND MAY ASK WHY RELIGION SHOULD REJECT THE AID OF ASSOCIATIONS WHICH EXIST IN EVERY NATION SUFFICIENTLY CIVILISED TO HAVE A CALENDAR AND WHICH ARE FOUND BY EXPERIENCE TO HAVE A POWERFUL AND OFTEN A SALUTARY EFFECT
HIS MAJESTY HAD ONLY TO APPEAR BEFORE THE GATES AND THEY WOULD INSTANTLY FLY OPEN JAMES NOW CHANGED HIS MIND AGAIN BLAMED HIMSELF FOR HAVING BEEN PERSUADED TO TURN HIS FACE SOUTHWARD AND THOUGH IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING CALLED FOR HIS HORSES THE HORSES WERE IN A MISERABLE PLIGHT
THEY ACTED UNDER NO AUTHORITY KNOWN TO THE LAW YET IT WAS HE OWNED BUT TOO EVIDENT THAT THEY WERE ENCOURAGED AND SCREENED BY SOME WHO WERE IN HIGH COMMAND HOW ELSE COULD IT BE THAT A MARKET OVERT FOR PLUNDER
COMPROMISE AFTER COMPROMISE WAS SUGGESTED FROM THE IMPERFECT REPORTS WHICH HAVE COME DOWN TO US IT APPEARS THAT EVERY ARGUMENT IN FAVOUR OF LENITY WAS FORCIBLY URGED BY BURNET BUT THE COMMONS WERE FIRM TIME PRESSED
AND AT NIGHT BONFIRES WERE LIGHTED ROCKETS DISCHARGED AND WINDOWS LIGHTED UP THE JACOBITES HOWEVER CONTRIVED TO DISCOVER OR TO INVENT ABUNDANT MATTER FOR SCURRILITY AND SARCASM THEY COMPLAINED BITTERLY THAT THE WAY FROM THE HALL TO THE WESTERN DOOR OF THE ABBEY HAD BEEN LINED BY DUTCH SOLDIERS
TAKEN ON HIMSELF PROVISIONALLY THE EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF THAT KINGDOM THE MEANS OF MAINTAINING ORDER THERE WERE NOT AT HIS COMMAND HE HAD NOT A SINGLE REGIMENT NORTH OF THE TWEED OR INDEED WITHIN MANY MILES OF THAT RIVER
EQUIPPING HER SON FOR A FIRST CAMPAIGN THE CABIN FURNITURE THE CAMP FURNITURE THE TENTS THE BEDDING THE PLATE WERE LUXURIOUS AND SUPERB NOTHING WHICH COULD BE AGREEABLE OR USEFUL TO THE EXILE
WHICH WAS ACTED IN THIS AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR AT SOME LOW THEATRE FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF THE ENGLISH POPULACE A CROWD OF HALF NAKED SAVAGES APPEARED ON THE STAGE HOWLING A CELTIC SONG AND DANCING ROUND AN OX
WHICH RESPECT FOR HIS IMMENSE POWER PREVENTED THEM FROM FULLY EXPRESSING AFTER REPEATEDLY VOWING FIDELITY TO BOTH PARTIES AND REPEATEDLY BETRAYING BOTH HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE SHOULD BEST PROVIDE FOR HIS SAFETY
AS SOON AS LONDONDERRY HAD FALLEN AND IT WAS UNIVERSALLY SUPPOSED THAT THE FALL OF LONDONDERRY COULD NOT BE LONG DELAYED HE MIGHT CROSS THE SEA WITH PART OF HIS FORCES AND LAND IN SCOTLAND WHERE HIS FRIENDS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE NUMEROUS WHEN HE WAS ONCE ON BRITISH GROUND AND IN THE MIDST OF BRITISH ADHERENTS
THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE ESTABLISHED RELIGION OF THE KINGDOM AND THAT THE FIRST DUTY OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO PUT AN END TO AN ANARCHY WHICH WAS DAILY PRODUCING DISASTERS AND CRIMES
HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT HER DELIBERATE JUDGMENT ON SUCH POINTS IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE FOUND IN AN ARTICLE OR A HOMILY THAN IN AN EJACULATION OF PENITENCE OR A HYMN OF THANKSGIVING IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT IN THE DEBATES ON THE COMPREHENSION BILL
EARL OF PORTLAND MORDAUNT WAS MADE EARL OF MONMOUTH NOT WITHOUT SOME MURMURING ON THE PART OF OLD EXCLUSIONISTS WHO STILL REMEMBERED WITH FONDNESS THEIR PROTESTANT DUKE AND WHO HAD HOPED THAT HIS ATTAINDER WOULD BE REVERSED AND THAT HIS TITLE WOULD BE BORNE BY HIS DESCENDANTS
THE PARLIAMENT LAID CLAIM TO A VETO ON THE NOMINATION OF THE JUDGES AND ASSUMED THE POWER OF STOPPING THE SIGNET IN OTHER WORDS OF SUSPENDING THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE TILL THIS CLAIM SHOULD BE ALLOWED
A PIKE A LONG KNIFE CALLED A SKEAN OR AT THE VERY LEAST A STRONG ASHEN STAKE POINTED AND HARDENED IN THE FIRE THE VERY WOMEN WERE EXHORTED BY THEIR SPIRITUAL DIRECTORS TO CARRY SKEANS EVERY SMITH
OF THE MASTER OF ARTS OF OXFORD WERE RESPECTED THE SENSE OF THE CONSTITUENT BODIES WAS TAKEN WITH AS LITTLE VIOLENCE ON THE PART OF MOBS WITH AS LITTLE TRICKERY ON THE PART OF RETURNING OFFICERS AS AT ANY GENERAL ELECTION OF THAT AGE
BUT WERE BROKEN AND SCATTERED THEN THE FLIGHT BECAME WILD AND TUMULTUOUS THE FUGITIVES BROKE DOWN THE BRIDGES AND BURNED THE FERRYBOATS WHOLE TOWNS THE SEATS OF THE PROTESTANT POPULATION
BELONGED TO HIS STEWARD OR TO HIS HEIR APPARENT THE MOST IMPORTANT MILITARY POST IN ATHOL WAS BLAIR CASTLE THE HOUSE WHICH NOW BEARS THAT NAME IS NOT DISTINGUISHED BY ANY STRIKING PECULIARITY
THE CLERGY OF THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH WERE TO USE THE PHRASE THEN COMMON RABBLED THE MORNING OF CHRISTMAS DAY WAS FIXED FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF THESE OUTRAGES FOR NOTHING DISGUSTED THE RIGID COVENANTER
AND NEVER HAD THE VAST PALACE AND THE SUMPTUOUS GARDENS PRESENTED A GAYER ASPECT IN THE EVENING THE TWO KINGS AFTER A LONG AND EARNEST CONFERENCE IN PRIVATE MADE THEIR APPEARANCE BEFORE A SPLENDID CIRCLE OF LORDS AND LADIES
THEN FOLLOWED CLAUSES PROVIDING THAT A CLERGYMAN MIGHT EXCEPT IN A FEW CHURCHES OF PECULIAR DIGNITY WEAR THE SURPLICE OR NOT AS HE THOUGHT FIT THAT THE SIGN OF THE CROSS MIGHT BE OMITTED IN BAPTISM THAT CHILDREN MIGHT BE CHRISTENED
IT IS A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN THIS COPY ALMOST THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE BILL CAN BE READ IN SPITE OF CANCELLATIONS AND INTERLINEATIONS
WAS NOT THAT SORT OF SCRUPULOSITY WHICH THE APOSTLE HAD COMMANDED BELIEVERS TO RESPECT IT SPRANG NOT FROM MORBID TENDERNESS OF CONSCIENCE BUT FROM CENSORIOUSNESS AND SPIRITUAL PRIDE
THE SON OF A MARTYR THE GRANDSON OF A MARTYR EXCLUDED FROM THE PARLIAMENT HOUSE IN WHICH NINE OF HIS ANCESTORS HAD SATE AS EARLS OF ARGYLE AND EXCLUDED BY A JUDGMENT ON WHICH THE WHOLE KINGDOM CRIED SHAME STILL LESS WAS IT TO BE EXPECTED
IT MAY BE SUSPECTED THAT THE EXTREME DISCOMFORT WHICH HE HAD UNDERGONE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS RESOLUTION FOR COMPLAINTS OF THAT DISCOMFORT MAKE UP A LARGE PART OF HIS LETTERS AND IN TRUTH A LIFE PASSED IN THE PALACES OF ITALY IN THE NEAT PARLOURS AND GARDENS OF HOLLAND
CUNNINGHAM AND SEVERAL OF HIS OFFICERS WENT ON SHORE AND CONFERRED WITH LUNDY LUNDY DISSUADED THEM FROM LANDING THEIR MEN THE PLACE HE SAID COULD NOT HOLD OUT TO THROW MORE TROOPS INTO IT WOULD THEREFORE BE WORSE THAN USELESS
SOME HAVE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A CONCEALED JACOBITE AND THAT HE HAD AFFECTED TO ACQUIESCE IN THE REVOLUTION ONLY IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT BE BETTER ABLE TO ASSIST IN BRINGING ABOUT A RESTORATION BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT HIS CONDUCT
OR AN OLD GUN BARREL IN A CORNER OF A MANSION
THE POINT REALLY IN ISSUE WAS WHETHER THE KING SHOULD BE IN IRISH OR IN BRITISH HANDS IF HE REMAINED AT DUBLIN IT WOULD BE SCARCELY POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO WITHHOLD HIS ASSENT FROM ANY BILL PRESENTED TO HIM BY THE PARLIAMENT WHICH HE HAD SUMMONED TO MEET THERE
THE VIOLENCE OF REVOLUTIONS IS GENERALLY PROPORTIONED TO THE DEGREE OF THE MALADMINISTRATION WHICH HAS PRODUCED THEM
BUT NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN THAN THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE MEMBERS WERE EITHER LOW CHURCHMEN OR NOT CHURCHMEN AT ALL A VERY FEW DAYS BEFORE THIS TIME AN OCCURRENCE HAD TAKEN PLACE UNIMPORTANT IN ITSELF BUT HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT AS AN INDICATION OF THE TEMPER OF THE MAJORITY
WHICH WERE TO BE USED AGAINST HIS NATION AND HIS RELIGION HE WAS FLUNG INTO PRISON IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT AT THE END OF FEBRUARY AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND IRISHMEN WERE IN ARMS NEAR FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM WERE SOLDIERS
THE CARCASSES HALF RAW AND HALF BURNED TO CINDERS SOMETIMES STILL BLEEDING
AS A CONFESSOR OF THE TRUE FAITH PERSECUTED BY HERETICS AS A NEAR KINSMAN OF THE HOUSE OF BOURBON
AND THAT THESE NEW SEPARATISTS MAY EITHER FORM THEMSELVES INTO A SECT FAR MORE FORMIDABLE THAN THE SECT WHICH WE ARE NOW SEEKING TO CONCILIATE OR MAY IN THE VIOLENCE OF THEIR DISGUST AT A COLD AND IGNOBLE WORSHIP
THOSE MARAUDERS WHO PREFERRED BOILED MEAT BEING OFTEN IN WANT OF KETTLES CONTRIVED TO BOIL THE STEER IN HIS OWN SKIN AN ABSURD TRAGICOMEDY IS STILL EXTANT
HE DID NOT ENVY YOUNGER MEN THE HONOUR OF LIVING ON POTATOES AND WHISKEY AMONG THE IRISH BOGS HE WOULD TRY TO CONSOLE HIMSELF WITH PARTRIDGES WITH CHAMPAGNE AND WITH THE SOCIETY OF THE WITTIEST MEN AND PRETTIEST WOMEN OF PARIS IT WAS RUMOURED HOWEVER
SINCE THE DECLARATION OF INDULGENCE HAD APPEARED BEEN VERY AGREEABLY SETTLED IN THE CAPITAL AND IN OTHER LARGE TOWNS AND WERE NOW ABOUT TO ENJOY UNDER THE SURE GUARANTEE OF AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT THAT TOLERATION WHICH
IF SUCH WERE THE WISH OF THEIR PARENTS WITHOUT GODFATHERS OR GODMOTHERS AND THAT PERSONS WHO HAD A SCRUPLE ABOUT RECEIVING THE EUCHARIST KNEELING MIGHT RECEIVE IT SITTING THE CONCLUDING CLAUSE WAS DRAWN IN THE FORM OF A PETITION
THE WALLS WOULD HAVE OFFERED VERY LITTLE RESISTANCE TO A BATTERING TRAIN BUT WERE QUITE STRONG ENOUGH TO KEEP THE HERDSMEN OF THE GRAMPIANS IN AWE ABOUT FIVE MILES SOUTH OF THIS STRONGHOLD
TO WHOSE ADVICE HE MAY HAVE RECOURSE WILL SET HIS MIND AT EASE BUT IF THIS RIDER SHOULD PASS IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DENY THAT THE CORONATION OATH IS MEANT TO PREVENT THE KING FROM GIVING HIS ASSENT TO BILLS WHICH MAY BE PRESENTED TO HIM BY THE LORDS AND COMMONS
HIS WANT OF ENERGY AND ABOVE ALL THE CREDULITY WITH WHICH HE HAD LISTENED TO THE PROFESSIONS OF SUNDERLAND HAD MADE AN UNFAVOURABLE IMPRESSION ON THE MIND OF LEWIS WHAT WAS TO BE DONE IN IRELAND WAS NOT WORK FOR A TRIFLER OR A DUPE
IT WAS BELIEVED INDEED AT THE FRENCH COURT THAT IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH HIM
BUT ON THIS SUBJECT THE HIGH CHURCHMEN COULD COUNT ON THE SUPPORT OF A LARGE BODY OF LOW CHURCHMEN THOSE MEMBERS WHO WISHED WELL TO NOTTINGHAM'S PLAN SAW THAT THEY WERE OUTNUMBERED AND DESPAIRING OF A VICTORY BEGAN TO MEDITATE A RETREAT
OF THE RIVER BRAWLING ROUND THE MOSSY ROCKS AND AMONG THE SMOOTH PEBBLES THE DARK MASSES OF CRAG AND VERDURE WORTHY OF THE PENCIL OF WILSON THE FANTASTIC PEAKS BATHED AT SUNRISE AND SUNSET
SHE SPRANG UP TOOK HER BAG FROM THE TABLE OPENED THE LITTLE PENKNIFE AND CUT CAREFULLY THROUGH THE THIN RUSHES SHE MIGHT HAVE TO REPLACE THE MATTING AND IT WAS NECESSARY SHE SHOULD DO HER WORK TIDILY SOON THE WHOLE OF THE TRAP WAS REVEALED
DEFTLY HE LIFTED HIS LEFT HAND FROM THE POCKET CROOKED THE ELBOW BY SOME QUICK MANIPULATION AND THRUST THE BOOKS WHICH THE VALET MOST RELUCTANTLY HANDED TO HIM BACK TO THE PLACE FROM WHENCE HE HAD TAKEN THEM TELL MISTER KARA I WILL CALL AT MY OWN TIME
IF I HAD YOU ARRESTED YOUR NAME WOULD APPEAR IN ALL THE PAPERS OF COURSE HE SAID NARROWLY AND YOUR PHOTOGRAPH WOULD PROBABLY ADORN THE SUNDAY JOURNALS HE ADDED EXPECTANTLY SHE LAUGHED
BUT IN THIS SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED THE GRIP ABOUT HER ARM WAS A GRIP OF STEEL AND SHE KNEW SAFETY DID NOT LIE IN THAT DIRECTION SHE PULLED BACK AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS THAT LED DOWN TO THE KITCHEN WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME SHE ASKED
YES SIR SAID THE VALET HASTILY IS IT REAL GREY INSISTED THE VISITOR PULL ONE OUT AND SEE THE STARTLED FISHER DREW BACK WITH AN APOLOGETIC SMILE I COULDN'T THINK OF DOING A THING LIKE THAT SIR OH YOU COULDN'T SNEERED THE VISITOR
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SIR GEORGE SAID T X TARTLY THAT I DESPAIR OF EVER CATALOGUING THEM YOU ARE AN INSOLENT CUB GROWLED HIS CHIEF COME TO LUNCH WHERE WILL YOU TAKE ME ASKED T X CAUTIOUSLY
I AM GOING TO PUT YOU INTO SAFE CUSTODY HE SAID ON THE WHOLE I THINK IT IS BEST THAT THE POLICE TAKE THIS MATTER IN HAND AND I SHALL LOCK YOU INTO MY WINE CELLAR AND GO OUT IN SEARCH OF A POLICEMAN THE BIG WOODEN DOOR OPENED REVEALING A SECOND DOOR
THE MAID WHO WAS ALSO COOK AROSE UP AS THE GIRL ENTERED IT'S A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES TO SEE YOU IN MY KITCHEN MISS SHE SMILED I'M AFRAID YOU'RE RATHER LONELY MISSUS BEALE SAID THE GIRL SYMPATHETICALLY LONELY MISS CRIED THE MAID
HE LIVED IN THE ADELPHI CORRECTED T X THERE WERE TWO PLACES WHERE HE LIVED SAID MANSUS WHEN DID YOU LEARN THIS ASKED HIS CHIEF DROPPING HIS FLIPPANCY
WAS WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF THE PAINTER THE TWO WARDERS EXCHANGED GREETINGS
HE WAS A SLOW METHODICAL PAINSTAKING MAN WITH A DELIBERATE AND AN OFFICIAL MANNER WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED T X QUICKLY WE DIDN'T SEARCH VASSALARO'S LODGINGS CRIED MANSUS BREATHLESSLY IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME AS I WAS COMING OVER WESTMINSTER BRIDGE
THAT THE MAKERS OFFERED TO INDEMNIFY HIM AGAINST ANY LOSS FROM BURGLARY T X FINISHED HIS WORK WASHED HIS HANDS AND WAS DRYING THEM WHEN MANSUS CAME BURSTING INTO THE ROOM IT WAS NOT USUAL FOR MANSUS TO BURST INTO ANYWHERE
WITH A CERTAIN KINDNESS AND A CERTAIN RESPECT WHICH WAS UNUSUAL FACE THE WALL GROWLED A VOICE AND MECHANICALLY HE TURNED HIS HANDS STILL BEHIND HIM AND STOOD STARING AT THE GREY WALL OF THE PRISON STOREHOUSE
SIX O'CLOCK EH YOU WILL TELL MISTER KARA THAT I CALLED GIVE ME THOSE BOOKS BUT I ASSURE YOU SIR STAMMERED FISHER GIVE ME THOSE BOOKS ROARED THE OTHER
AND THE FACE OF THE DRIVER WAS HALF ENVELOPED IN A BIG RUBBER MASK THROUGH THE TWO GREAT GOGGLES JOHN COULD SEE LITTLE TO HELP HIM IDENTIFY THE MAN AS THE MACHINE CAME UP TO THE GATE HE LEAPT INTO THE TONNEAU AND SANK INSTANTLY TO THE BOTTOM
JOHN STUMBLED DOWN THE SLOPE AS HE NEARED THE MACHINE HE STOPPED AND GASPED KARA HE SAID AND THE BROWN MAN SMILED BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
HE RANG THE BELL THIS TIME FOR HIS VALET FISHER HE SAID I AM EXPECTING A VISIT FROM A GENTLEMAN NAMED GATHERCOLE A ONE ARMED GENTLEMAN WHOM YOU MUST LOOK AFTER IF HE COMES
AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME FROM KARA'S ROOM A FAINT CLANG WHAT'S THAT ASKED THE VISITOR A LITTLE STARTLED MISTER KARA'S PUT DOWN HIS STEEL LATCH SAID FISHER WITH A SMILE WHICH MEANS THAT HE IS NOT TO BE DISTURBED UNTIL HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
FOR A MOMENT HE THOUGHT HE WAS ALONE AND LOOKED AROUND
THE GIRL WAS BEWILDERED ALMOST PANIC STRICKEN SHE SHRUNK BACK FROM THE ENTRANCE OF THE INNER ROOM FEARFUL OF WHAT SHE WOULD SEE AND THEN FROM THE INTERIOR CAME A SOUND THAT MADE HER TINGLE WITH HORROR IT WAS A SOUND OF A SIGH LONG AND TREMBLING
AS IT HAPPENED MOST OF KARA'S VALUABLE AND CONFIDENTIAL POSSESSIONS WERE AT THE BANK IN A FRET OF PANIC AND AT CONSIDERABLE COST HE HAD THE SAFE REMOVED AND ANOTHER PUT IN ITS PLACE OF SUCH POTENCY
THIS IS AN ORDER FOR THE RELEASE OF JOHN LEXMAN CONVICTED UNDER SENTENCE OF FIFTEEN YEARS PENAL SERVITUDE THE GOVERNOR LOOKED AT IT
AND AS THE AEROPLANE FELL HE HAD TIME TO OBSERVE THAT A BOAT HAD BEEN PUT OFF THEN WITH A JERK THE MONOPLANE FLATTENED OUT AND CAME LIKE A SKIMMING BIRD TO THE SURFACE OF THE WATER HER ENGINES STOPPED
MISTER GATHERCOLE SAID THE GIRL QUICKLY FISHER NODDED YES MISS I COULDN'T GET HIM TO STAY THOUGH SHE PURSED HER LIPS THOUGHTFULLY MISTER KARA WILL BE VERY CROSS BUT I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN HELP IT I WISH YOU HAD CALLED ME
THERE WAS A THICK CARPET ON THE FLOOR COMFORTABLE EASY CHAIRS A LITTLE BOOKCASE WELL FILLED AND A READING LAMP THIS MUST BE KARA'S UNDERGROUND STUDY WHERE HE KEPT HIS PRECIOUS PAPERS
RECOGNIZING T X HE CHECKED HIS SARCASM WHICH HE HAD PREPARED FOR A KEYLESS LODGER
THEY WOULD MAKE A FORMIDABLE WEAPON AND WRAPPING HER HANDKERCHIEF ROUND THE HANDLE TO GIVE IT A BETTER GRIP SHE PLACED IT ON THE TABLE WITHIN REACH SHE WAS DIMLY CONSCIOUS ALL THE TIME THAT SHE HAD HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT THIS WINE CELLAR
THIS SETTLES THE MATTER HE SAID IN THE CAB ON THE WAY BACK FIND OUT THE FIRST TRAIN FOR TAVISTOCK IN THE MORNING AND WIRE THE GEORGE HOTEL TO HAVE A CAR WAITING
HAD T X RETURNED HE SLIPPED FROM THE BED AND WENT TO THE DOOR OPENED IT SLIGHTLY AND LISTENED T X WITH A SEARCH WARRANT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF PANIC ESPECIALLY IF HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE HAD SATISFIED T X AND ALLAYED HIS SUSPICIONS
FORTY THREE HE CALLED SHARPLY I WANT YOU DOWN HERE JOHN TOOK HIS PAINT POT AND BRUSH AND WENT CLATTERING DOWN THE UNCARPETED STAIRS WHERE'S THE OTHER MAN ASKED THE WARDER IN A LOW VOICE
THAT IN ONE OF THESE STREAMS I SHALL FIND WHAT I AM SEEKING YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN UP HOPE THEN IN REGARD TO LEXMAN I SHALL NEVER GIVE UP HOPE SAID T X UNTIL I AM DEAD AND POSSIBLY NOT THEN LET ME SEE WHAT DID HE GET FIFTEEN YEARS
AND WANTS TO KNOW IF HE CAN HAVE A PRIVATE TELEPHONE CONNECTION BETWEEN HIS HOUSE AND THE CENTRAL OFFICE WE TOLD HIM THAT HE COULD ALWAYS GET THE NEAREST POLICE STATION ON THE PHONE BUT THAT DOESN'T SATISFY HIM HE HAS MADE BAD FRIENDS WITH SOME GENTLEMAN OF HIS OWN COUNTRY WHO SOONER OR LATER HE THINKS WILL CUT HIS THROAT
HE WAS IN DEBT TO THE MAN HE KILLED HIS STORY OF THREATENING LETTERS WAS NOT SUBSTANTIATED THE REVOLVER WHICH HE SAID HAD BEEN FLOURISHED AT HIM HAD NEVER BEEN FOUND
UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT ANY RATE HE'S A FUNK SNAPPED THE OTHER A BEASTLY FUNK HE STAMPED DOWN THE STAIRS AS THOUGH TESTING THE WEIGHT OF EVERY TREAD OPENED THE FRONT DOOR WITHOUT ASSISTANCE SLAMMED IT BEHIND HIM AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT
FISHER CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM AND RETURNED TO HIS DUTIES IN THE HALL BELOW TEN MINUTES LATER HE HEARD THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BOOMING VOICE OF THE STRANGER CAME DOWN TO HIM FISHER WENT UP THE STAIRS TO MEET HIM AND FOUND HIM ADDRESSING THE OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM IN HIS OWN ECCENTRIC FASHION
GET UP HE HALF LIFTED HALF DRAGGED HER TO HER FEET AND LED HER FROM THE ROOM THEY DESCENDED TO THE HALL TOGETHER AND THE GIRL SPOKE NO WORD PERHAPS SHE HOPED THAT SHE MIGHT WRENCH HERSELF FREE AND MAKE HER ESCAPE INTO THE STREET
HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MISTER GATHERCOLE AND KARA CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE TO MEET HIS AGENT WHO WITH TOP HAT STILL ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND HIS OVERCOAT DANGLING ABOUT HIS HEELS MUST HAVE MADE A REMARKABLE PICTURE
WHICH CAME INTO THE EYES OF THE QUESTIONER WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FIFTEEN YEARS SAID THE OTHER THAT MEANS ELEVEN YEARS AND NINE MONTHS SAID THE FIRST MAN YOU'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE I SUPPOSE HARDLY SAID LEXMAN DRILY
REMEMBERING THAT HIS PREDECESSOR HAD LOST HIS JOB FROM A TOO CONFIDING FRIENDLINESS
KARA FOLDED THE LETTER AND INSERTED IT IN ITS ENVELOPE HE RANG A BELL ON HIS TABLE AND THE GIRL WHO HAD SO FILLED T X WITH A SENSE OF AWE CAME FROM AN ADJOINING ROOM YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS IS DELIVERED MISS HOLLAND
AND ONCE HE HEARD A HOLLOW RUMBLE AS IT CROSSED A WOODEN BRIDGE HE COULD NOT DETECT FROM HIS HIDING PLACE IN WHAT DIRECTION THEY WERE GOING BUT HE GATHERED THEY HAD SWITCHED OFF TO THE LEFT
HE WAS ABREAST OF HER WHEN HE SUDDENLY SWUNG ROUND AND CATCHING HER IN HIS ARMS HE CAUGHT HER CLOSE TO HIM BEFORE SHE COULD REALISE WHAT HE PLANNED HE HAD STOOPED SWIFTLY AND KISSED HER FULL UPON THE MOUTH IF YOU SCREAM I SHALL KISS YOU AGAIN HE SAID
WHO HAS NO PARTICULAR POSITION IN LONDON SOCIETY AND THEREFORE HAS NO REASON FOR COMING HERE WHO OPENLY EXPRESSES HIS DETESTATION OF THE CLIMATE WHO HAS A MAGNIFICENT ESTATE IN SOME WILD PLACE IN THE BALKANS WHO IS AN EXCELLENT HORSEMAN A MAGNIFICENT SHOT AND A PASSABLE AVIATOR
AT THE SIDE OF THE SEAT HE PASSED IT BACK JOHN LEXMAN READ IF YOU CANNOT SWIM THERE IS A LIFE BELT UNDER YOUR SEAT JOHN NODDED KARA WAS SEARCHING THE SEA FOR SOMETHING AND PRESENTLY HE FOUND IT
CLOSED THE DOOR CAREFULLY AND RETURNED TO THE HOUSE
NEVERTHELESS HE PERSISTED
THAT THE HEART COULD DESIRE IN THE WAY OF FELLOWSHIP EMINENT POLITICIANS WHO MIGHT CONCEIVABLY BE OF SERVICE TO AN AMBITIOUS YOUNG ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF POLICE BEAUTIFUL LADIES TO INTEREST AND AMUSE HIM KARA HAD EVEN GONE TO THE LENGTH OF ENGAGING A THEATRICAL COMPANY TO PLAY
I'VE AN IDEA HE'S RATHER HIT FOR MONEY HE WAS IN THAT ROUMANIAN GOLD SWINDLE AND BY HIS GENERAL GLOOM WHICH ONLY COMES TO A MAN WHEN HE'S IN LOVE AND HE CAN'T POSSIBLY BE IN LOVE SINCE HE'S MARRIED OR WHEN HE'S IN DEBT I FEAR THAT HE IS STILL FEELING THE EFFECT OF THAT ROSY ADVENTURE
THE WORLD HE LOVED AND THE WORLD THAT KNEW HIM AND ALL THAT THERE WAS IN LIFE ALL THAT WAS WORTH WHILE HAD BEEN CRUSHED AND OBLITERATED INTO THE GRANITE OF THE PRINCETOWN QUARRIES
FISHER WENT BACK TO THE LIBRARY THE GIRL WAS SEALING UP SOME LETTERS AS HE ENTERED AND LOOKED UP I AM AFRAID MISS HOLLAND I'VE GOT MYSELF INTO VERY SERIOUS TROUBLE WHAT IS THAT FISHER ASKED THE GIRL
THERE IS ONE DOOR WHICH IN ADDITION TO ITS ORDINARY LOCK IS CLOSED BY A SORT OF STEEL LATCH WHICH HE LETS FALL WHEN HE RETIRES FOR THE NIGHT AND WHICH HE OPENS HIMSELF PERSONALLY IN THE MORNING
MANSUS HAS DONE HIS BEST THE OTHER WENT ON EASILY
HE REMEMBERED WITH A SAVAGE JOY THE SPECTACLE OF HIS WOULD BE ASSASSINS TWITCHING AND STRUGGLING ON THE GALLOWS AT PEZARA AND
HE DARE NOT LET HIS MIND DWELL UPON THE LONG ACHING YEARS AHEAD HE DARE NOT THINK OF THE WOMAN HE LEFT OR LET HIS MIND DWELL UPON THE AGONY WHICH SHE WAS ENDURING HE HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE WORLD
T X CAME FROM DOWNING STREET AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK ONE NIGHT AND HIS HEART WAS FILLED WITH JOY AND GRATITUDE HE SWUNG HIS STICK TO THE COMMON DANGER OF THE PUBLIC BUT THE POLICEMAN ON POINT DUTY AT THE END OF THE STREET
BY ALL MEANS SAID T X LET THEM PERSONALLY I DON'T CARE WHERE THEY GO BUT IF THAT IS THE EXTENT OF YOUR INFORMATION I CAN SUPPLEMENT IT
AND ILLUSTRATING HIS INSTRUCTION OR HIS ADMONITION WITH THE QUAINTEST PHRASEOLOGY NOW HE WAS TILTED BACK IN HIS OFFICE CHAIR AT AN ALARMING ANGLE SCOWLING AT HIS DISTRESSED SUBORDINATE WHO SAT ON THE EDGE OF A CHAIR AT THE OTHER SIDE OF HIS DESK
HE MUST HAVE READ HER THOUGHTS FOR HE CAME NEARER AND STOOD OVER HER YOU NEEDN'T SHRINK MY YOUNG FRIEND HE SAID WITH A LITTLE CHUCKLE
HE WAS A MAN WHO WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED ATTENTION IF ONLY FROM THE SOMEWHAT ECCENTRIC NATURE OF HIS DRESS AND HIS UNKEMPT APPEARANCE HE WAS DRESSED IN A WELL WORN OVERCOAT OF A SOMEWHAT PRONOUNCED CHECK HE HAD A TOP HAT GLOSSY AND OBVIOUSLY NEW AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
THE CASE WAS COMPLETE BUT WHAT CLINCHED THE MATTER WAS THE FINDING OF A WAD OF THAT PECULIAR CHEMICAL PAPER
NO MORE PATAGONIA HE ROARED NO MORE TIERRA DEL FUEGO HE PAUSED CERTAINLY HE REPLIED TO SOME QUESTION BUT NOT PATAGONIA HE PAUSED AGAIN
HE CLICKED OVER A LEVER AND WITH A ROAR THE BIG THREE BLADED TRACTOR SCREW SPUN THE AEROPLANE MOVED FORWARD WITH A JERK
THE APOLOGIES WHICH ARE DUE TO YOU I FEEL THAT ANYTHING LESS WILL NEITHER REHABILITATE ME IN YOUR ESTEEM NOR SECURE FOR ME THE REMNANTS OF MY SHATTERED SELF RESPECT I AM HOPING YOU WILL DINE WITH ME NEXT WEEK AND MEET A MOST INTERESTING MAN GEORGE GATHERCOLE
ALL I KNOW IS THAT ONE OF THE WORKING PARTY GOT AWAY THE CAR CAME TO THE GATES OF THE PRISON AND T X SPRANG OUT FOLLOWED BY HIS ASSISTANT HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE GOVERNOR A GREATLY PERTURBED MAN FOR AN ESCAPE IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER
HE DID NOT KNOW WHEN MISTER KARA WOULD RETURN PERHAPS IT WOULD BE A LONG TIME AND PERHAPS A SHORT TIME HE MIGHT COME BACK THAT NIGHT OR HE MIGHT NOT YOU ARE WASTING YOUR YOUNG LIFE SAID T X BITTERLY YOU OUGHT TO BE A FORTUNE TELLER
THE CELLAR WAS DRY AND CLEAN AND ITS WALLS WERE ENAMELLED WHITE
HE USED THE ADELPHI ADDRESS FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES
WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY TAKEN BY THE PRISON STAFF AND IT WAS TO THE DECORATION OF ONE OF THESE THAT A O FORTY THREE HAD BEEN SENT THE HOUSE WAS AS YET WITHOUT A TENANT A PAPER HANGER UNDER THE CHARGE OF ANOTHER WARDER
HE HAS FOUND ALL THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND SAID T X WE DO NOT PERFORM MIRACLES IN THIS DEPARTMENT SIR GEORGE NOR CAN WE PICK UP THE THREADS OF A CASE AT FIVE MINUTES NOTICE
SHE FELT HER KNEES SHAKE UNDER HER AND THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO SWOON SHE PUT OUT HER DISENGAGED HAND TO STEADY HERSELF AND IF THE FACE WHICH WAS TURNED TO HIM WAS PALE THERE WAS A STEADFAST RESOLUTION IN HER DARK EYES LET ME RELIEVE YOU OF THAT MISS HOLLAND
BURNT THE LOCKS FROM HIS SAFE AND SECURED THE NECESSARY INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE
THE OFFICIAL WAS INCLINED TO BE BRUSQUE IN HIS MANNER BUT AGAIN THE MAGIC CARD PRODUCED A SOOTHING EFFECT I AM RATHER RATTLED SAID THE GOVERNOR ONE OF MY MEN HAS GOT AWAY I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW THAT
I AM A POLICE OFFICER AND I WANT YOU TO COME ALONG WITH ME AND OF COURSE HE SHUT UP AND WOULD NOT SAY ANOTHER WORD SAID T X THAT'S TRUE SIR SAID MANSUS BUT AFTER AWHILE I GOT HIM TO TALK
WHAT LIKE OF MAN WAS HE ASKED T X THE BRIEF DESCRIPTION THE MAN GAVE SENT A COLD CHILL TO THE COMMISSIONER'S HEART
JOHN LEXMAN LOOKED DOWN HE SAW THE INDENTATIONS OF THE COAST
AND THIS VIEW OF THE STRANGER'S INFIRMITY WAS CONFIRMED WHEN THE OTHER REACHED ROUND WITH HIS RIGHT HAND TOOK HOLD OF THE GLOVED LEFT HAND AND THRUST IT INTO THE POCKET OF HIS OVERCOAT WHERE IS KARA GROWLED THE STRANGER
AND THE GRATIFICATION HE STROVE SO DESPERATELY TO DISGUISE KARA WAS A VAIN MAN IMMENSELY CONSCIOUS OF HIS GOOD LOOKS CONSCIOUS OF HIS WEALTH
HE TURNED FROM T X TO THE DISCOMFORTED INSPECTOR VERY LITTLE SAID T X I'VE HAD MANSUS ON THE JOB
GOOD MORNING TO YOU IF YOU WOULD ONLY WAIT SIR PLEADED THE AGONIZED FISHER WAIT BE HANGED SNARLED THE OTHER I'VE WAITED THREE YEARS I TELL YOU TELL MISTER KARA TO EXPECT ME WHEN HE SEES ME HE WENT OUT AND MOST UNNECESSARILY BANGED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM
HE SAT UP WITH A SUDDENNESS WHICH CAUSED THE POLICE OFFICER TO START BACK IN ALARM LISTEN SAID T X GRASPING AN IVORY PAPERKNIFE SAVAGELY IN HIS HAND AND TAPPING HIS BLOTTING PAD TO EMPHASIZE HIS WORDS
HOW ASKED JOHN IN SURPRISE THE MAN JERKED HIS HEAD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISON LARRY GREEN HE SAID BRIEFLY HE'S COMING OUT NEXT MONTH TOO AND WE ARE ALL FIXED UP PROPER WE ARE GOING TO GET THE PILE
THE MAN COLOURED WITH PLEASURE FOR THE SUBORDINATES OF T X LOVED HIM AND A WORD OF PRAISE WAS ALMOST EQUAL TO PROMOTION IT WAS ON THE ADVICE OF MANSUS THAT THE ROAD FROM LONDON TO LEWES HAD BEEN CAREFULLY COVERED AND SUCH STREAMS AS PASSED BENEATH THAT ROAD HAD BEEN SEARCHED
BEYOND THE VILLAGE OF PRINCETOWN AND ON THE TAVISTOCK ROAD
ALL THIS I KNOW HE SAID PATIENTLY IF YOU WILL FURTHER UNFOLD THE SECRET DOSSIER SIR GEORGE I AM PREPARED TO BE THRILLED
WHICH TOLD JOHN AS CLEARLY AS THOUGH THE MAN HAD CONFESSED AS MUCH THAT HE HAD NEVER OCCUPIED ANY SOCIAL POSITION IN LIFE THE WARDER'S STEP ON THE STONES OUTSIDE REDUCED THEM TO SILENCE SUDDENLY HIS VOICE CAME UP THE STAIRS
ALWAYS GET YOUR MONEY IN ADVANCE IS THAT CLEAR TO YOU YES SIR SAID FISHER BUT I THINK YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND THAT MISTER KARA IS ALWAYS MOST GENEROUS ABOUT MONEY DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT MY POOR MAN SAID THE OTHER YOU
WHIP A MAN AND THE MEMORY OF IT PASSES FRIGHTEN HIM FILL HIM WITH A SENSE OF FOREBODING AND APPREHENSION AND LET HIM BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING DREADFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN EITHER TO HIMSELF OR TO SOMEONE HE LOVES BETTER THE LATTER
THERE GOES FIFTEEN HUNDRED POUNDS SAID THE GREEK WITH A SMILE
AND FISHER STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WONDERED WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO MAKE THE VISITOR SO GENIAL I SUPPOSE YOUR CHEQUE WILL BE HONOURED ALL RIGHT ASKED THE VISITOR SARDONICALLY AND THEN BURST INTO A LITTLE CHUCKLE OF LAUGHTER AS HE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR
KARA BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF AND HIS FACE WAS WREATHED IN SMILES WHY OF COURSE TELL HIM TO COME UP ASK HIM IF HE MINDS SEEING ME IN MY ROOM I TOLD HIM YOU WERE IN BED SIR AND HE USED SHOCKING LANGUAGE SAID FISHER KARA LAUGHED SEND HIM UP HE SAID
FOR I HAVE SENT THE MAID TO BUY SOME MORE STAMPS TO THE GENERAL POST OFFICE LET ME GO SHE GASPED NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME HE SAW THE TERROR IN HER EYES AND THERE SURGED WITHIN HIM THAT MAD SENSE OF TRIUMPH
HE HEARD THE SHUFFLING FEET OF THE QUARRY GANG HIS EARS CAUGHT THE CLINK OF THE CHAINS WHICH BOUND THEM TOGETHER THEY WERE DESPERATE MEN PECULIARLY INTERESTING TO HIM AND HE HAD WATCHED THEIR FACES FURTIVELY IN THE EARLY PERIOD
SHE EXAMINED THE ROOM CAREFULLY AT THE FARTHERMOST END WAS ANOTHER DOOR AND THIS SHE PUSHED GENTLY AT FIRST AND THEN VIGOROUSLY WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SLIGHTEST IMPRESSION SHE STILL HAD HER BAG A SMALL AFFAIR OF BLACK MOIRE WHICH HUNG FROM HER BELT
HIS ENVY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO GENUINE GOING OUT THE DRIVE IN THE BRAKE TO THE STATION THE RIDE TO LONDON IN CREASED BUT COMFORTABLE CLOTHING FREE AS THE AIR AT LIBERTY TO GO TO BED AND RISE WHEN HE LIKED
THE GIRL FEARED THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOMETHING BESIDES LETTING OFF STEAM IN THE CHALLENGE HER UNCLE HAD THROWN DOWN TO HIS ENEMY OR TO THE MEN THAT ENEMY COULD HIRE TO ATTACK HIM THE TIMBER SLEDGES SOON BEGAN TO DRIFT BACK
YOU'RE FOOLING NOW HE HASN'T HIRED ANY HALF BAKED CHIP EATERS AND CANUCKS TO TRY AND BEAT ME UP I AIN'T FOOLIN PSHAW YOU KIN PSHAW TILL THE COWS COME HOME CRIED THE OTHER HEATEDLY I GOT IT STRAIGHT WHO FROM
AND WEAVING BACK AND FORTH ACROSS IT CAN JUDGE ITS MARKET VALUE SO NEARLY RIGHT THAT HIS EMPLOYER THE PROSPECTIVE TIMBER MERCHANT IS ABLE TO BID INTELLIGENTLY FOR THE SO CALLED STUMPAGE ON THE TRACT
AND NAN WAS GLAD TO BUNDLE UP AGAIN AND RUN OUT TO WATCH THE EXODUS THEY WERE A MIGHTY CREW AS UNCLE HENRY HAD SAID THE BIG WOODS DID NOT BREED RUNTS
BECAUSE OF THE REASON GIVEN IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER INCIDENT THAT MARKED THE OCCASION TO THE GIRL'S MIND AND THAT WAS THE THREAT OF GEDNEY RAFFER REPORTED TO HER UNCLE HENRY
WITH HIS JOINTS STIFFENED AND MUSCLES THROBBING WITH PAIN TOBY HAD SEEN THE GAUNT WOLF OF STARVATION MORE TERRIBLE THAN ANY TIMBER WOLF WAITING AT HIS DOORSTONE
IF AUNT KATE HAD REALLY GOT HER GREAT SCAR THERE AND IF IT WAS REALLY TRUE THAT TWO MEMBERS OF HER UNCLE'S FAMILY HAD MET THEIR DEATH IN THE CONFLAGRATION SHE TRIED NOT TO THINK AT ALL OF INJUN PETE
GOT THE OLD MAN RIGHT DOWN TO CASES THAT SO ASKED MISTER SHERWOOD CURIOUSLY WHAT'S GED GOING TO DO CHALLENGE ME TO A GAME OF CAT'S CRADLE OR DOES HE WANT TO SETTLE THE BUSINESS AT DRAUGHTS THREE BEST OUT O FIVE
TO FLICK HIS OFF HORSE WITH THE WHIPLASH JUST THEN THE REAR WHEEL ON THAT SIDE SLUMPED DOWN INTO WHAT SEEMED A VERITABLE VOLCANO
CRANING HIS NECK TO LOOK UP INTO THE TALL STRAIGHT TREE I I'M ALMOST SURE STAMMERED NAN I DON'T SEE ANY SMOKE DRAWLED TOM WITH HIS HEAD STILL RAISED
IT WAS A SMOKING FURNACE DOWN THERE AND SOON THE FELLOE AND SPOKES WOULD BE INJURED BY THE FLAMES AND HEAT SPARKS FLEW ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND FROM OUT OF THE MOUTH OF THE HOLE
DIDN'T YOU USTER VISIT EM WHEN THEY LIVED AT PALE LICK NO I DON'T REMEMBER THAT THEY EVER LIVED ANYWHERE ELSE BESIDE HERE YES THEY DID I HEARD GRAN'THER TELL ABOUT IT
I EXPECT THERE AIN'T ENOUGH OF THAT GINGHAM LEFT TO TIE AROUND A SORE THUMB NAN LISTENED TO THIS IN BOTH AMUSEMENT AND SURPRISE THE GIRL WAS A NEW SPECIMEN TO HER COME IN ANYWAY SHE URGED I CAN'T KEEP THE WINDOW OPEN
TIED CAREFULLY WITH STRONG CORD NAN PATTED IT GENTLY WITH HER HAND BEFORE SHE LEFT THE BOX WHISPERING YOU DEAR I WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT YOU BEHIND FOR ANYTHING I WON'T LET THEM KNOW YOU ARE HERE BUT SOMETIMES WHEN I'M SURE NOBODY WILL INTERRUPT
ASKED NAN WHAT HONEY HE RESPONDED THAT BEND IN THE RIVER WHY
LOOK AGAIN NAN URGED HER COUSIN THIS IS NO FUNNING IF THERE'S FIRE IN THIS SWAMP GOODNESS GRACIOUS SNAPPED NAN
TO GASPED THE GIRL LEAPING OFF THE TONGUE TOO AND AWAY FROM THE HORSES HEELS TO THE ROAD GET TOWARD HOME CRIED TOM RUNNING AROUND TO THE REAR OF THE TIMBER CART
AND THE DRIVERS HERDED THE LOGS WITH ALL THE SKILL OF COWBOYS ON THE RANGE EACH DRIVE WAS ATTENDED BY ITS OWN CREW WHO GUARDED THE LOGS ON EITHER BANK
DECLARED NAN WITH HER EYES TIGHTLY CLOSED SHE REALLY THOUGHT HE WAS TOO STUBBORN OF COURSE IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY FIRE IN THAT TREE TOP THIS RAIN WOULD PUT IT OUT IN ABOUT TEN SECONDS SO NAN BELIEVED
SHE FELT BASHFUL BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF SO MANY ROUGH MEN BUT THEY LEFT HER ALONE FOR THE MOST PART AND SHE COULD LISTEN AND WATCH OLD TOBY VANDERWILLER TELL YOU WHAT GED'S BEEN BLOWIN ABOUT HENRY ASKED ONE OF THE MEN AT THE TABLE
HIS OLD WIFE AND A CRIPPLED GRANDSON WERE DEPENDENT ON TOBY TOO THUS IN DESPERATE STRAITS TOBY VANDERWILLER HAD ACCEPTED HELP FROM GEDNEY RAFFER
NAN WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT THE TWO BROTHERS SMILED AGAIN AT EACH OTHER THEIR RECENT TIFF SEEMED TO BE FORGOTTEN SOME OF THE CHOPPERS HAD ALREADY GONE ON AHEAD TO THE PART OF THE TRACT WHERE THE MARKED TREES WERE BEING FELLED
BUT THEY WANT TO FIGHT SO MUCH GASPED NAN SHO SAID HER UNCLE SLOWLY IT'S MOSTLY TALK THEY FEEL THE ITCH FOR HARD WORK AND HARD PLAY THAT'S ALL
SWEPT ACROSS THE STAGE OF THE OPEN TRACT OF SAWDUST IN A FEW MINUTES THEY WERE SATURATED TO THE SKIN NAN COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY WETTER IF SHE HAD GONE IN SWIMMING OH SHE GASPED INTO TOM'S EAR
AND UNGRACEFULLY SPRAWLED IN THE SNOW UPON HER BACK SHE COULD NOT GET AWAY BEFORE NAN HAD THE WINDOW OPEN THE SASH WAS HELD UP BY A NOTCHED STICK NAN PUT HER HEAD AND SHOULDERS OUT INTO THE FROSTY AIR AND STARED DOWN AT THE PROSTRATE GIRL
AND SOMETIMES COLLIDING WITH THE STONE PIERS OF THE BRIDGE WITH SUFFICIENT FORCE TO SPLIT THE UNHEWN TIMBERS FROM END TO END SOME BEING LAID OPEN AS NEATLY AS THOUGH DONE WITH AXE AND WEDGE
FOR IT DOES TAKE LOTS OF PLUCK TO DO WORK OF THIS KIND NAN CONFIDED TO HER UNCLE WHO WALKED UP AND DOWN ON THE PORCH SMOKING AN AFTER BREAKFAST PIPE YES NO SOFTIES ALLOWED ON THE JOB SAID HE CHEERFULLY SOME OF THE BOYS MAY BE ROUGH AND HARD NUTS TO CRACK
AUNT MATILDY SAYS HE'S ALLUS CREAKIN ROUND LIKE A RUSTY GATE HINGE WHY THAT DOESN'T SOUND VERY NICE OBJECTED NAN DON'T YOU LOVE YOUR GRANDFATHER NOT MUCH SAID THIS PERFECTLY FRANK YOUNG SAVAGE HE'S SO AWFULLY WIZZLED
I'VE NEWLY COME HERE YES ADMITTED NAN WELL BUT I'M NOT SUCH A SIGHT AM I LAUGHED THE GIRL FROM TILLBURY BUT YOU ARE LYING THERE IN THE SNOW YOU'LL GET YOUR DEATH OF COLD GET UP THE OTHER DID SO
THAT SHE HAD BEGUN FOR BESS HARLEY'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT EVERY WEEK SHE SENT OFF TO TILLBURY A BULKY SECTION OF THIS REPORT OF HER LIFE IN THE BIG WOODS IT WAS QUITE WONDERFUL HOW MUCH THERE PROVED TO BE TO WRITE ABOUT
IT IS THE DELUGE
FIRE'S NO FUNNING I TELL YOU HE GROWLED SOMETIMES IT SMOULDERS FOR DAYS AND DAYS AND WEEKS AND WEEKS THEN IT BURSTS OUT LIKE A HURRICANE BUT THE
SHE BESS LIVED ONLY IN HOPES OF MEETING HER CHUM AT LAKEVIEW HALL THE NEXT SEPTEMBER THIS HOPE NAN SHARED BUT IT ALL LAY WITH THE RESULT
THE WOODSMEN WERE A RACE OF GIANTS BESIDE THE NARROW SHOULDERED FLAT CHESTED PYGMIES WHO TOILED IN THE MILLS TOM STRODE BY WITH HIS TIMBER SLED RAFE LEAPED ON TO RIDE AND TOM PLAYFULLY SNAPPED HIS WHIPLASH AT HIM
THE ROAR OF THE FRESHET AWOKE NAN IN HER BED BEFORE DAYBREAK SO SHE WAS NOT SURPRISED TO SEE THE RIVER IN SUCH A TURMOIL WHEN AFTER A HASTY BREAKFAST SHE AND UNCLE HENRY WALKED BESIDE THE FLOOD
HIS RIGHT LEG HAD GONE INTO THE YIELDING MASS UP TO HIS HIP AND DESPITE HIS STRUGGLES HE COULD NOT GET IT OUT A LONG YELLOW FLAME SHOT OUT OF THE HOLE AND ALMOST LICKED HIS FACE
NOW NANNY SHERWOOD SHE SCOLDED HERSELF THERE'S NOT A PARTICLE OF USE OF YOUR SNIVELING IT WON'T GET YOU ANYWHERE AS MISSUS JOYCE SAYS YOU'LL ONLY MAKE YOUR EYES RED AND THE FOLKS WILL SEE THAT YOU'RE NOT HAPPY HERE AND THEY WILL BE HURT
ONLY MADE NAN MORE KEENLY ALIVE TO HIS DANGER SHE DARED NOT DISCUSS THE MATTER WITH AUNT KATE FOR NAN FEARED TO WORRY THAT GOOD WOMAN UNNECESSARILY
THE MEN BEGAN ONE BY ONE TO PUSH BACK THE BENCHES AND GO OUT THERE WAS A GREAT BUSTLE OF GETTING UNDER WAY AS THE TEAMS STARTED FOR THE WOODS AND THE CHOPPERS TOO WENT AWAY TOM HURRIED TO START HIS BIG PAIR OF DAPPLE GRAYS
BUT ONCE STARTED THE RUNNERS SLIPPED ALONG EASILY ENOUGH EVEN THROUGH THE DEEP SNOW PACKING THE COMPRESSIBLE STUFF IN ONE PASSAGE AS HARD AS ICE NAN FOLLOWED IN THIS NARROW TRACK TO THE VERY BANK OF THE RIVER WHERE THE LOGS WERE HEAPED IN LONG WINDROWS
NAN CHOKED IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH THERE MUST BE FIRE UNDER THIS SAWDUST NOW TOM BROUGHT HIS OWN GAZE DOWN FROM THE EMPTY TREE TOP WITH A JERK HOO HE SHOUTED AND LEANED FORWARD SUDDENLY
CHAPTER FIFTEEN A CAT AND HER KITTENS THAT WAS A BREAKFAST LONG TO BE REMEMBERED BY NAN SHERWOOD NOT PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF ITS QUALITY BUT FOR THE QUANTITY SERVED
AND WAS TOSSED TWENTY FEET BY A PUFF OF WIND WE'RE OVER AN OVEN GASPED TOM AND LAID THE WHIP SOLIDLY ACROSS THE BACKS OF THE FRIGHTENED HORSES THEY PLUNGED
AND ONCE IN A WHILE A REAR WHEEL BUMPED OVER A STUMP AND NAN WAS GLAD TO DROP DOWN UPON THE TONGUE AGAIN AND CLING MORE TIGHTLY THAN EVER TO HER COUSIN'S COLLAR SURE THAT'S IT QUERIED TOM
I'M NAN SHERWOOD AND I'VE COME HERE TO PINE CAMP TO STAY WHILE MY FATHER AND MOTHER HAVE GONE TO SCOTLAND I'VE HEARD ABOUT SCOTLAND DECLARED THE GIRL WITH THE VERY PROMINENT EYES HAVE YOU YES GRAN'THER LLEWELLEN SINGS THAT SONG YOU KNOW
THE DEAL TABLE WAS GRACED BY NO CLOTH OR NAPERY OF ANY KIND THERE WERE HEAPS OF POTATOES AND ONIONS FRIED TOGETHER AND GOLDEN CORNBREAD WITH BOWLS OF WHITE GRAVY TO LADLE OVER IT
SHE RAN TO THE WINDOW EVIDENTLY STARTLING THE PEEPER QUITE AS MUCH AS SHE HAD BEEN STARTLED HERSELF
SIM BARKIS HIM WHAT'S COOKIN FOR BECKETT'S CREW GOOD MAN SIM NEVER CAUGHT HIM IN A LIE YET YOU ARE BEGINNING TO SOUND REASONABLE JOSH AND MISTER SHERWOOD PUT DOWN HIS KNIFE AND FORK AND LOOKED SHREWDLY AT HIS INFORMANT
TOM CHIRRUPED TO THE HORSES AND MADE THEM THOUGH UNWILLING GO FORWARD THEY DRAGGED THE HEAVY CART UNEVENLY THROUGH THE HEAVY DOWNPOUR THE TRAIL WAS HARD TO FOLLOW
NO YOU WON'T DECLARED HER COUSIN LEAPING DOWN GET OFF AND RUN NAN BUT YOU DO AS I SAY COMMANDED TOM RUN
NAN WAS INDEED HAPPY AT THIS JUNCTURE HER PARENTS WERE SAFELY OVER THEIR VOYAGE ON THE WINTRY OCEAN SO A PART OF HER WORRY OF MIND WAS LIFTED MEANWHILE
ANOTHER GEYSER OF FIRE AND SMOKE SPURTED FROM THE HOLE INTO WHICH THE REAR WHEEL HAD SLUMPED AGAIN AND AGAIN THE BIG HORSES FLUNG THEMSELVES INTO THE COLLARS IN AN ENDEAVOR TO GET THE WHEEL OUT
AND TRIED TO TELL HER TO AVOID THE FIRE NAN RUSHED IN GOT BEHIND HIM AND SEIZED HER COUSIN UNDER THE ARMS
AWFUL CONFLAGRATION IN WHICH SHE BELIEVED TWO CHILDREN BELONGING TO HER UNCLE AND AUNT HAD LOST THEIR LIVES HAD STARTED IN THE SAWDUST SUDDENLY SHE CRIED ALOUD AND SEIZED TOM MORE TIGHTLY
SO SHE HAD NOBODY BUT THE COOK AND HIS HELPER TO SPEAK TO FOR A TIME THEREFORE IT WAS LONELINESS THAT MADE HER START OVER THE HALF BEATEN TRAIL FOR THE SPOT WHERE THE MEN WERE AT WORK WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO ANYBODY
NAN LONGED TO SPILL THE CONTENTS OF HER INK BOTTLE OVER THAT HIDEOUS COVERLET BUT DID NOT DARE THE EFFORT TO MAKE THE BIG EAST ROOM LOOK LESS LIKE A BARN MADE NAN FEEL BETTER IN HER MIND IT WAS STILL DREARY IT MUST BE CONFESSED
THAT HAD GRACED HER BEDROOM THESE APPEARED FROM THE TRUNK EVEN BEFORE SHE HUNG AWAY HER CLOTHES IN THE UNPLASTERED CLOSET WHERE THE COLD WIND SEARCHED THROUGH THE CRACKS FROM OUT OF DOORS INTO THAT CLOSET AWAY BACK IN THE CORNER WENT A LONG PASTEBOARD BOX
SO THE CURIOUS YOUNG GIRL KEPT HER LIPS CLOSED UPON THE SUBJECT BUT SHE CERTAINLY WAS DESIROUS OF KNOWING ABOUT THAT FIRE SO LONG AGO AT PALE LICK HOW IT CAME ABOUT
FOR THE MOMENT THE GIRL FELT AS IF HER HEART HAD STOPPED BEATING OH TOM OH TOM SHE SHRIEKED AND SPRANG TOWARD HIM TOM WAS STRUGGLING TO GET UP
IT WAS WARM IN THE ROOM THE ATMOSPHERE BEING PERMEATED WITH THE SWEET TANG OF WOOD SMOKE NAN DRIED HER EYES THERE REALLY WAS NOT ANY USE IN CRYING MOMSEY AND PAPA SHERWOOD COULD NOT KNOW HOW BAD SHE FELT AND SHE REALLY WAS NOT SELFISH ENOUGH TO WISH THEM TO KNOW
IT HAD TASSELED EARS A WIDE WICKED SMILE BRISTLING WHISKERS AND FANGS THAT REALLY MADE NAN TREMBLE ALTHOUGH SHE WAS SOME YARDS FROM THE BOBCAT AS SHE BELIEVED FROM WHAT HER COUSINS HAD TOLD HER BOBCATS ARE NOT USUALLY DANGEROUS
SOME ADVISED AN UTTER DISREGARD OF THE LAW OTHERS WERE EVIDENTLY MINDED TO INCREASE THE TROUBLE BETWEEN RAFFER AND UNCLE HENRY BY MALICIOUS TALE BEARING OFTEN NAN THOUGHT OF WHAT UNCLE HENRY HAD SAID TO OLD
AFTER A GULP OF COFFEE FROM HIS THICK CHINA CUP SOME OF THE BOYS AT BECKETT'S YOU KNOW THEY'RE A TOUGH CROWD WAS RIGGIN HIM ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID TO HIM DOWN TO THE FORKS AND GED SPIT OUT THAT HE'D GIVE A LUMP OF MONEY TO SEE YOU ON YOUR BACK HUH GRUNTED UNCLE HENRY
MAKING HER EXIT AS SHE HAD HER ENTRANCE BY THE WINDOW I RECKON YOU NEVER SEEN THIS HOUSE OF YOUR UNCLE'S BEFORE DID YOU QUERIED MARGARET AT ONE POINT IN THE CONVERSATION OH NO I NEVER VISITED THEM BEFORE
WHO STARED UP AT HER IN RETURN WHAT DO YOU WANT NAN ASKED NOTHIN REPLIED THE STRANGER WHAT WERE YOU PEEPING IN FOR TO SEE YOU WAS THE MORE FRANK REPLY WHAT FOR ASKED NAN
IT WAS A GALA DAY MARKED ON NAN'S CALENDAR WHEN UNCLE HENRY COMING HOME FROM THE RAILROAD STATION BEHIND THE ROAN PONIES CALLED TO HER TO COME OUT AND GET THE MESSAGE
THE LOGS WERE GATHERED IN AN ORDERLY COMPACT MASS AND THE MEN COULD GENERALLY GET THEIR SLEEP SAVE FOR THE WATCHMAN UNLESS THERE CAME A SUDDEN RISE OF WATER IN THE NIGHT IT WAS A SIGHT LONG TO BE REMEMBERED NAN THOUGHT
CRACKY DON'T CHOKE A FELLOW HE COUGHED OH TOM
CRIED NAN CONSCIENCE STRICKEN IN SPITE OF THE BEATING RAIN AND WIND SHE GOT TO HER KNEES STILL CLINGING TO HER BIG COUSIN AND THEN STOOD UPON THE BROAD TONGUE OF THE WAGON
SIM COME AWAY BEFORE THEY GOT THAT FAR OF COURSE GED DIDN'T SAY RIGHT OUT IN OPEN MEETIN THAT HE'D GIVE SO MANY DOLLARS FOR YOUR SCALP BUT HE GOT EM ALL INT'RESTED AND IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE HIM SO SIM SAID IF ON THE QUIET SOME OF THOSE PLUG UGLIES HAD AGREED TO DO THE JOB
CHAPTER TWENTY SIX BUFFETED BY THE ELEMENTS NAN KNEW SHE HAD NEVER SEEN IT RAIN SO HARD BEFORE THE FALLING WATER WAS LIKE A DROP CURTAIN
I'M MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU JOSH FOR TELLING ME I NEVER GO AFTER TROUBLE AS YOU FELLOWS ALL KNOW BUT I SHA'N'T TRY TO DODGE IT EITHER HE PICKED UP HIS KNIFE AND FORK AND WENT QUIETLY ON WITH HIS BREAKFAST BUT NAN COULD NOT EAT ANY MORE AT ALL
SHE WAS VERY CAREFUL OF THE LAMPS USED IN THE HOUSE SHE INSISTED UPON CLEANING AND CARING FOR THEM HERSELF SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW A CANDLE TO BE USED BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE OVERTURNED AND SHE SAW TO IT HERSELF THAT EVERY FIRE
AND THE DEEP SNOW SHE HAD FOUND IN THE BIG WOODS MADE NAN FORGET THAT MARCH WAS PASSING AND TIMID APRIL WAS TREADING ON HIS HEELS A RAIN LASTING TWO DAYS AND A NIGHT WASHED THE ROADS OF SNOW
I'LL UNPACK I'LL COVER UP EVERYTHING UGLY THAT I CAN WITH SOMETHING PRETTY FROM TILLBURY HURRIED AS SHE HAD BEEN HER DEPARTURE FROM THE COTTAGE ON AMITY STREET NAN HAD PACKED IN HER TRUNK MANY OF THOSE LITTLE POSSESSIONS DEAR TO HER CHILDISH HEART
IT INDEED SCORCHED HIS HAIR ON ONE SIDE OF HIS HEAD BUT NAN DID NOT SCREAM AGAIN SHE NEEDED HER BREATH ALL THAT SHE COULD GET FOR A MORE PRACTICAL PURPOSE HER COUSIN WAVED HER BACK FEEBLY
AND TWOULD BE A FINE CHIMNEY IF THE FIRE WAS SMOULDERING DOWN AT ITS OLD ROOTS OH TOM I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING GASPED NAN AND YOU DON'T SEE THE TREE NOW
IT WAS A PITIFULLY SMALL SUM RAFFER WOULD ADVANCE UPON THE LITTLE FARM BUT IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO PUT TOBY IN THE USURER'S POWER THIS WAS THE STORY NAN LEARNED REGARDING TOBY
LAUNCHING THOSE THAT SHOALED ON THE NUMEROUS SANDBARS OR IN THE SHALLOWS KEEPING THEM FROM PILING UP IN COVES AND IN THE MOUTHS OF ESTUARIES OR CREEKS
NONE OF THE TEAMS HAD COME BY FOR SOME TIME BUT SHE COULD HEAR FAINTLY THE SOUND OF THE AXES AND THE CALLING OF THE WORKMEN TO EACH OTHER AND THEIR SHARP COMMANDS TO THE HORSES SHE WENT AWAY FROM THE CAMP A FEW HUNDRED YARDS AND THEN FOUND THAT THE TRAIL FORKED
IN A MINUTE HE HAD LOPPED OFF THE BRANCHES FOR TWENTY FEET THEN REMOVED THE TOP WITH A SINGLE BLOW AS HE TURNED DRAGGING THE POLE WITH HIM UP SPRANG THE FIRE AGAIN FROM THE HOLLOW INTO WHICH THE WHEEL OF THE WAGON HAD SUNK
AND DREW IT IN AND SHUT DOWN THE WINDOW THE STRANGE GIRL WAS WARMING HER HANDS AT THE FIRE NAN PUSHED A CHAIR TOWARD HER AND TOOK ONE HERSELF BUT NOT THE COMPLAINING SPRING ROCKING CHAIR NOW TELL ME ALL ABOUT YOURSELF THE GIRL DEMANDED
WHICH CARRIED COOK AND PROVISIONS FOR THE MEN A BOOM LOGS CHAINED TOGETHER END TO END WAS THROWN OUT FROM ONE SHORE OF THE WIDE STREAM AT NIGHT AND ANCHORED AT ITS OUTER END BEHIND THIS
THE OFFICIATING PRIEST THE BEADLE
SO THAT MONSIEUR LE BARON CONTINUED THE GROCER
HER THOUGHTS HAD ALMOST CEASED TO HOLD COMMUNION WITH THINGS OF THE WORLD AND WHEN SHE SAW THE PALE VIOLET TINTS OF EARLY DAWN
WHICH IS AS AGREEABLE TO THE EYE AS IT IS EXQUISITE TO THE PALATE AND PORTHOS FINISHED BY SMACKING HIS LIPS THE KING OPENED HIS EYES WITH DELIGHT AND WHILE CUTTING SOME OF THE
HE IS ALWAYS IN VERY HIGH SPIRITS
IT WAS HE WHO HAD BEEN THE FIRST TO FAIL IN KEEPING THE OATH WHICH HE HAD SWORN THAT VERY DAY TWELVE HOURS ONLY BETWEEN HIS OATH AND HIS PERJURED VOW IT WAS NOT LONG ALAS TO HAVE PRESERVED THE ILLUSION
NOT YET AH YES THE GRAVE DIGGER IS WAITING UNTIL THE CORDS ARE FASTENED ROUND THE BIER BUT
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT ALL SHE SAID THE KING LOVES HER HE REPLIED BUT YOU SEEM TO THINK SHE DOES NOT LOVE HIM ALAS MADAME I WAS THINKING OF THE TIME WHEN SHE LOVED ME
HE COULD ACT COULD MOVE ABOUT COULD COME TO HER WHILE SHE COULD DO NOTHING BUT WAIT AND THE POOR GIRL WAITED AND WAITED WITH BREATHLESS ANXIETY FOR SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT POSSIBLE THAT THE KING WOULD NOT COME
PRESENTLY SAID PORTHOS PHLEGMATICALLY I SHALL COME TO THAT BY AND BY IN FACT IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE IT CAME TO THE BOAR'S TURN FOR THE KING SEEMED TO TAKE PLEASURE IN URGING ON HIS GUEST
WHILST THE FOLIAGE OF JASMINE AND CLIMBING ROSES HUNG IN MASSES FROM THE WINDOW FRAMES SPLENDIDLY ILLUMINATED A DAMASK TABLE CLOTH AS WHITE AS SNOW THE TABLE WAS LAID FOR TWO PERSONS AMBER COLORED WINE SPARKLED IN A LONG CUT GLASS BOTTLE
AND THE WEATHER WAS EXCEEDINGLY WARM THERE WAS ONLY ONE WINDOW OPEN AND THAT ONE BELONGING TO A ROOM
THE BEST WAY IN THAT CASE SAID PORTHOS IS TO EAT NO SUPPER AT ALL AND YET I AM VERY HUNGRY I ADMIT AND EVERYTHING LOOKS AND SMELLS MOST INVITINGLY AS IF APPEALING TO ALL MY SENSES AT ONCE
THE KING HAD NOW ARRIVED AT THE ENTREMENTS BUT WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF PORTHOS WHO CONTINUED TO PLAY HIS PART IN THE BEST MANNER
AND HE UNHESITATINGLY EMBRACED THE LADY IN QUESTION NOT HOWEVER
SEEMED AS IF HE HAD CEASED TO BE A SOLDIER AS IF HE WERE NO LONGER AN OFFICER BELONGING TO THE PALACE BUT WAS ON THE CONTRARY A QUIET EASY GOING CITIZEN IN A STATE OF STAGNATION BETWEEN HIS DINNER AND SUPPER OR BETWEEN HIS SUPPER AND HIS BED
A POOR FRANCISCAN MENDICANT FRIAR REPLIED THE LATTER WHO HAD NOT EVEN A DOG TO LOVE HIM IN THIS WORLD AND TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO HIS LAST RESTING PLACE IF THAT WERE REALLY THE CASE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN
AH INDEED SAID THE MUSKETEER CONTINUING HIS IMPERCEPTIBLE TONE OF IRONY
HAWTHORN AND WILD HOPS FORMED AN IMPENETRABLE FENCE BEHIND WHICH ROSE A WHITE HOUSE WITH A HIGH TILED ROOF
IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE NO LONGER YOUR ORDERS TO ISSUE OR YOUR MEN TO REVIEW AND MANEUVER YOU NEED THE SOUND OF GUNS DRUMS AND ALL THAT DIN AND CONFUSION
WHICH WAS BITING HER FINGERS AND HANGING BY THE LACE OF HER COLLAR MADAME SEEMED PLUNGED IN DEEP THOUGHT SO DEEP INDEED THAT IT REQUIRED BOTH MONTALAIS AND RAOUL'S VOICE TO DISTURB HER FROM HER REVERIE YOUR HIGHNESS SENT FOR ME
WHENEVER ANY ONE ASKED HIM HOW DO YOU INTEND TO DRESS YOURSELF THIS EVENING HE REPLIED I SHALL UNDRESS MYSELF AT WHICH THE LADIES ALL LAUGHED
MONSIEUR LE BARON DU VALLON
FOR WHAT IN DEED IS SUCH A WOUND AFTER ALL RAOUL STARTED ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF SHE IS RETURNING TO IT WHAT DID YOU SAY SHE INQUIRED I DID NOT SAY ANYTHING MADAME
BUT A FORTUNATE MOVEMENT OF THE HORSE MADE HIM MISS HIS AIM
YES I SENT FOR YOU SO YOU HAVE RETURNED FROM ENGLAND YES MADAME AND AM AT YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS'S COMMANDS THANK YOU LEAVE US MONTALAIS AND THE LATTER IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE ROOM
IT WAS NOW ABOUT HALF PAST TEN HE WOULD EITHER COME TO HER OR WRITE TO HER
I ASSURE YOU IT IS VERY CURIOUS HARDLY A DAY PASSES THAT SOME ONE IS NOT BURIED THERE FOR FONTAINEBLEAU IS BY NO MEANS AN INCONSIDERABLE PLACE SOMETIMES WE SEE YOUNG GIRLS CLOTHED IN WHITE CARRYING BANNERS
WHAT MUST HE HAVE THOUGHT OF THE OBSTINACY WITH WHICH SHE REMAINED SILENT IMPATIENT AND IRRITABLE AS THE KING WAS KNOWN TO BE IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY THAT HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO PRESERVE HIS TEMPER SO LONG
AND SO NOT ONLY DID THE KING NOT LOVE HER BUT HE DESPISED HER WHOM EVERY ONE ILL TREATED HE DESPISED HER TO THE EXTENT EVEN OF ABANDONING HER TO THE SHAME OF AN EXPULSION WHICH WAS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING AN IGNOMINIOUS SENTENCE PASSED ON HER
IN THE BEAUTIFUL MEADOWS WHERE THE GRASS GREW AS HIGH AS THE KNEES AND WHERE HE HAD PLAYED UNDER THE GREEN APPLE TREES COVERED WITH RED CHEEKED FRUIT HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE HAD SOLEMNLY PROMISED HIMSELF THAT AS SOON AS HE SHOULD HAVE MADE HIS FORTUNE HE WOULD RETURN TO NATURE
FOR THERE IS ALWAYS THAT BUSTLING AND NOISY INN WHICH IS A VERY DISAGREEABLE NEIGHBOR I HAD FOUR WINDOWS HERE BUT I BRICKED UP TWO LET US GO ON SAID D'ARTAGNAN
THE FOREMAN CLASPED HIS HANDS TOGETHER THE TWO OTHERS GOT UNDER THE COUNTERS FEARING PORTHOS MIGHT HAVE A TASTE FOR HUMAN FLESH WE SHALL ONLY TAKE A SORT OF SNACK HERE SAID D'ARTAGNAN
HE WAS A CLEVER FELLOW ALTHOUGH OF A VERY ODD COMPLEXION WHICH WAS THE SAME COLOR AS YOUR OLIVES WELL THIS ARAB WHENEVER HE HAD DONE EATING OR WORKING USED TO SIT DOWN TO REST HIMSELF
AND YOUR INSTINCTIVE KINDNESS AND GENEROSITY OF DISPOSITION INDUCE YOU TO BE CAREFUL AND CONSIDERATE AS TO YOUR MANNER OF CONVEYING IT WILL YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS THROW THIS KIND FORBEARANCE ASIDE I AM ABLE TO BEAR EVERYTHING AND I AM LISTENING
WHICH HE HAD HITHERTO SO ARDENTLY WISHED FOR YET HAD DREADED SO MUCH HE REPLIED I LEFT MADAME A DEAR FRIEND IN GOOD HEALTH AND ON MY RETURN I FIND HIM VERY ILL
PORTHOS ON THE CONTRARY WAS LIVELY AND COMMUNICATIVE D'ARTAGNAN'S FOOT HAD MORE THAN ONCE TO REMIND HIM OF THIS PECULIARITY OF THE KING
HE ENTERED FIRST LEADING HIS HORSE AFTER HIM BY THE BRIDLE INTO A SMALL COURTYARD WHERE AN ODOR MET THEM WHICH REVEALED THEIR CLOSE VICINITY TO A STABLE THAT SMELLS ALL RIGHT SAID PORTHOS LOUDLY GETTING OFF HIS HORSE AND I ALMOST BEGIN TO THINK
LOWER NOR COULD SHE SUFFER MORE THAN SHE HAD ALREADY SUFFERED HER COUNTENANCE DID NOT EVEN CHANGE BUT SHE REMAINED KNEELING WITH HER HANDS CLASPED LIKE THE FIGURE OF THE MAGDALEN DID YOU HEAR ME SAID MADAME
OH IF HE WOULD BUT COME IF HE WOULD BUT COME HOW EAGERLY SHE WOULD FORGIVE HIM FOR ALL HE HAD JUST MADE HER SUFFER HOW MUCH MORE TENDERLY SHE WOULD LOVE HIM BECAUSE SHE HAD SO CRUELLY SUFFERED
I SHOULD LIKE TO PASS YOU MONSIEUR IF IT IS NOT TROUBLING YOU TOO MUCH VERY WELL SAID PORTHOS IT DOES NOT TROUBLE ME IN THE LEAST AT THE SAME MOMENT HE TOOK HOLD OF THE YOUNG FELLOW BY THE WAISTBAND LIFTED HIM OFF THE GROUND AND PLACED HIM VERY GENTLY ON THE OTHER SIDE
PLANCHET YOU KNOW THAT I AM NEVER BORED EXCEPT TO DAY AND THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY BAH MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN IT IS A WEEK SINCE YOU RETURNED HERE FROM FONTAINEBLEAU
HERE IS INDEED A MODEL OF GASTRONOMY IT WAS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT OUR FATHERS WHO SO WELL KNEW WHAT GOOD LIVING WAS
THIS IS VERY FINE I ADMIT TO KNEEL AND PRAY AND MAKE A PRETENSE OF BEING RELIGIOUS BUT HOWEVER SUBMISSIVE YOU MAY BE IN YOUR ADDRESS TO HEAVEN IT IS DESIRABLE THAT YOU SHOULD PAY SOME LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE WISHES OF THOSE WHO REIGN AND RULE HERE BELOW
WHEREABOUTS MONSIEUR AT YOUR CHATEAU OH MONSIEUR LE BARON I HAVE NEITHER CHATEAU NOR PARK NOR MEADOWS NOR WOODS WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THEN INQUIRED PORTHOS AND WHY DO YOU CALL IT A COUNTRY SEAT I DID NOT CALL IT A COUNTRY SEAT MONSIEUR LE BARON
LA VALLIERE RAISED HER HEAD PAINFULLY IN TOKEN OF RESPECT NOT LONG SINCE CONTINUED MADAME A CERTAIN RECOMMENDATION WAS ADDRESSED TO YOU I BELIEVE
WHOM I LIKE AND ESTEEM VERY MUCH I WILL BE YOUR FRIEND ON THIS OCCASION YOU HOLD YOUR HEAD HIGH AS A MAN OF HONOR SHOULD AND I DEEPLY REGRET THAT YOU MAY HAVE TO BOW BEFORE RIDICULE AND IN A FEW DAYS IT MIGHT BE CONTEMPT
HAS BEEN ABLE TO REACH ME HENRIETTA WAS AFFECTED BY HIS EXTREME PALLOR HIS GENTLENESS AND HIS GREAT COURAGE THE PRINCIPAL FEELING IN HER HEART AT THAT MOMENT WAS AN EAGER DESIRE TO HEAR THE NATURE OF THE REMEMBRANCE
D'ARTAGNAN WHOM NOTHING EVER ESCAPED REMARKED HOW MUCH REDDER TRUCHEN'S LEFT CHEEK WAS THAN HER RIGHT
PORTHOS BOWED WITH A REVERENCE WHICH ANNE OF AUSTRIA WOULD HAVE APPROVED OF
AFTER A PROLONGED REFLECTION ON THE SUBJECT THE MOST INGENIOUS MEANS THAT SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WAS TO LET HIMSELF ROLL OFF THE SACK ON TO THE FLOOR MURMURING AT THE SAME TIME AGAINST HIMSELF THE WORD STUPID BUT
HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO AMIDST THESE BRILLIANT BUTTERFLIES OF FASHION AFTER FOLLOWING THE KING DURING TWO WHOLE DAYS AT FONTAINEBLEAU
BEGAN TO THROB MORE AND MORE PAINFULLY THESE PULSATIONS AS THEY GRADUALLY INCREASED SOON CHANGED INTO A SPECIES OF BRAIN FEVER AND IN HER TEMPORARY DELIRIUM SHE SAW THE FIGURES OF HER FRIENDS CONTENDING WITH HER ENEMIES
YOU SHOULD NOT CALL HER MADAME SAID D'ARTAGNAN WHY NOT ASKED PLANCHET BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE HER SEEM OLDER EVERY TIME YOU CALL HER SO WELL
THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD WAS ALREADY UP THE COOK WAS MERCILESSLY SLAUGHTERING IN THE POULTRY YARD CELESTIN WAS GATHERING WHITE CHERRIES IN THE GARDEN PORTHOS
I PERCEIVE HE IS AN AMATEUR THE ORDER WAS IMMEDIATELY OBEYED THEN CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION HE SAID AND YOU DO NOT FIND THE LAMB TOO FAT NO SIRE THE FAT FALLS DOWN AT THE SAME TIME AS THE GRAVY DOES AND SWIMS ON THE SURFACE
OH NO SIRE PIERREFONDS IS IN THE SOISSONNAIS I THOUGHT YOU ALLUDED TO THE LAMB ON ACCOUNT OF THE SALT MARSHES NO SIRE I HAVE MARSHES WHICH ARE NOT SALT IT IS TRUE BUT WHICH ARE NOT THE LESS VALUABLE ON THAT ACCOUNT
THE CAVALIER KNEELS AT THE BEGINNING THE YOUNG LADY BY AND BY GETS TAMED DOWN AND THEN IT IS SHE WHO HAS TO SUPPLICATE WHO IS THIS LADY I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO ASCERTAIN THIS SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER FOR ARAMIS WAS THE FIRST TO LEAVE
AH PLANCHET MY FRIEND RETURNED D'ARTAGNAN YOU ARE GETTING AMBITIOUS
AND YET PLANCHET FANCIED THAT IN TOKEN OF TACIT APPROVAL HE SAW HIM IMPERCEPTIBLY SMILE AT THE WORD STUPID THIS EMBOLDENED HIM TO SAY ARE YOU ASLEEP MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN NO PLANCHET I AM NOT EVEN ASLEEP REPLIED THE MUSKETEER
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT ENDS AND ALSO BECAUSE IT IS FULL OF POACHERS HOW CAN THE POACHERS MAKE THE FOREST SO AGREEABLE TO YOU BECAUSE THEY HUNT MY GAME AND I HUNT THEM
OH SAID PLANCHET MOUSQUETON IS NOT DEAD AND YET MONSIEUR LE BARON IS VERY FOND OF HIM
MONSIEUR SAID PLANCHET I AM ONE OF THOSE GOOD HUMORED SORT OF MEN WHOM HEAVEN CREATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF LIVING A CERTAIN SPAN OF DAYS
I HAVE HAD FOUR AVENUES LAID OUT AND AT THE END OF EACH IS A LANDSCAPE OF AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT CHARACTER FROM THE OTHERS
IT WAS JUST SUCH A COMPLIMENT D'ARTAGNAN WOULD CHOOSE WHERE HE DID NOT FEEL DISPOSED TO PAY ANY OTHER
AH REPLIED HENRIETTA WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND THEN THAT WHICH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS WISHES ME TO UNDERSTAND SAID RAOUL TREMBLING NOTWITHSTANDING HIS COMMAND OVER HIMSELF AS HE PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS
OH HOW SHE WOULD DEVOUR HIS LETTER HOW EAGER SHE WOULD BE TO ANSWER IT AND WHEN THE MESSENGER WHO HAD BROUGHT IT HAD LEFT HER HOW SHE WOULD KISS IT READ IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN PRESS TO HER HEART THE LUCKY PAPER WHICH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT HER EASE OF MIND
HENRIETTA MORE CHARMING THAN EVER WAS HALF LYING HALF RECLINING IN HER ARMCHAIR HER SMALL FEET UPON AN EMBROIDERED VELVET CUSHION SHE WAS PLAYING WITH A KITTEN WITH LONG SILKY FUR
AND THEN RECOVERING HERSELF ADDED BUT HAS HE ANYTHING TO COMPLAIN OF HAS HE COMPLAINED OF ANYTHING IS THERE ANY CAUSE OF GRIEF OR SORROW THAT WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH I ALLUDE ONLY TO HIS WOUND MADAME
PEOPLE EAT WELL WHO WORK WELL REPLIED THE KING
IN THE MEANTIME D'ARTAGNAN WHO HAD DISMOUNTED WITH HIS USUAL AGILITY INHALED THE FRESH PERFUMED AIR WITH THE DELIGHT A PARISIAN FEELS AT THE SIGHT OF GREEN FIELDS AND FRESH FOLIAGE
AND HOLDING UP HER HEAD PERTLY IN THE AIR PRECEDED HIM TO MADAME'S APARTMENTS WHERE HE WAS AT ONCE INTRODUCED WELL HE THOUGHT THIS DAY WILL PASS AWAY WITHOUT MY LEARNING ANYTHING GUICHE SHOWED TOO MUCH CONSIDERATION FOR MY FEELINGS
I AM IN DESPAIR SAID PLANCHET TO HEAR SUCH A WORD AS EVEN WELL
I MUST AND WILL LEARN WHO THAT WOMAN IS SAID THE MUSKETEER AGAIN AND THEN WITHOUT FURTHER DELIBERATION HE SET OFF IN PURSUIT OF HER AS HE WAS GOING ALONG HE TRIED TO THINK HOW HE COULD POSSIBLY CONTRIVE TO MAKE HER RAISE HER VEIL SHE IS NOT YOUNG HE SAID
WHILE WE ADDED HIS MAJESTY DO NOTHING BUT TANTALIZE WITH OUR STOMACHS AND AS HE SPOKE HE TOOK THE BREAST OF A CHICKEN WITH HAM WHILE PORTHOS ATTACKED A DISH OF PARTRIDGES AND QUAILS THE CUP BEARER FILLED HIS MAJESTY'S GLASS
BETWEEN THE TWO A SMALL DOOR WITH A PORCH SUPPORTED BY A COUPLE OF PILLARS FORMED THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE THE DOOR WAS GAINED BY A STEP RAISED A LITTLE FROM THE GROUND
TELLING HER THAT HE LOVED HER ASKING FOR HER LOVE IN RETURN REQUIRING HER TO SWEAR AND HIMSELF TO SWEAR TOO THAT NEVER SHOULD AN EVENING PASS BY IF EVER A MISUNDERSTANDING WERE TO ARISE BETWEEN THEM WITHOUT A VISIT A LETTER
WHAT IS IT INQUIRED PORTHOS LOOKING ALL ROUND HIM AS IF IN SEARCH OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ANNOYED PLANCHET AND DESIROUS OF FREEING HIM FROM IT WHY FORMERLY SAID THE GROCER YOU USED TO CALL ME PLANCHET QUITE SHORT
HOW CAN I AVOID HAVING MY MOUTH FULL IF I EAT SAID PORTHOS ALL YOU HAVE TO DO REPLIED THE CAPTAIN OF THE MUSKETEERS IS SIMPLY TO SWALLOW WHAT YOU HAVE IN IT WHENEVER THE KING DOES YOU THE HONOR TO ADDRESS A REMARK TO YOU
WHAT IS THERE FOR ME TO BE SATISFIED OR DISSATISFIED ABOUT MADAME
BUT D'ARTAGNAN DID NOT STIR
AND HEAVEN FORGIVE HER FOR THE MENTAL EXCLAMATION THEY WERE AWAITING THE KISS WHICH THE KING'S LIPS HAD IN THE MORNING SO SWEETLY INDICATED WHEN HE PRONOUNCED THE WORD LOVE
FRANKLY CONCEDED D'ARTAGNAN COMPLIMENTED PLANCHET AND SAID YOU ARE INDEED A MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO MAKE LIFE AGREEABLE LIFE MONSIEUR SAID PLANCHET LAUGHING IS CAPITAL WHICH A MAN OUGHT TO INVEST AS SENSIBLY AS HE POSSIBLY CAN
AND TRUCHEN WAS LOOKING AT HIM WITH A MOST BEWITCHING SMILE THE SPARKLING WINE OF ANJOU VERY SOON PRODUCED A REMARKABLE EFFECT UPON THE THREE COMPANIONS
WITH IMPERTURBABLE SELF POSSESSION I HAVE HEARD HE IS A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF YOURS HE IS INDEED MADAME WELL IT IS QUITE TRUE HE HAS BEEN WOUNDED BUT HE IS BETTER NOW OH
EXACTLY WELL THEN I AM LIKE HIS HARE HE HAS GOT A HARE ALSO THEN HE HAS ALL SORTS OF ANIMALS WELL WHAT DOES HIS HARE DO THEN
FOR THE MORROW BUT THE GROCER HAD A HEART OF GOLD EVER MINDFUL OF THE GOOD OLD TIMES A TRAIT THAT CARRIES YOUTH INTO OLD AGE SO PLANCHET NOTWITHSTANDING A SORT OF INTERNAL SHIVER CHECKED AS SOON AS EXPERIENCED
IN POINT OF FACT THEN BETTER TO SIT DOWN THAN TO STAND UP IS PLAIN ENOUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE MAY BE FATIGUED AND PLANCHET SMILED IN A ROGUISH WAY AS FOR BETTER TO BE LYING DOWN LET THAT PASS
SHE HAD INSPIRED THE QUEEN WITH THAT MORTAL JEALOUSY WHICH IS THE STINGING SCORPION AT THE HEEL OF EVERY WOMAN'S HAPPINESS MADAME IN A WORD IN HER ATTEMPTS TO CURE A WOUNDED PRIDE FOUND THAT HER HEART HAD BECOME DEEPLY AND PASSIONATELY ATTACHED
SOME OF WHOM FROM EMULATION HAD ATTEMPTED TO FOLLOW THEM BUT WERE OBLIGED TO GIVE UP HALF WAY THE KING SOON BEGAN TO GET FLUSHED AND THE REACTION OF THE BLOOD TO HIS FACE ANNOUNCED THAT THE MOMENT OF REPLETION HAD ARRIVED
PORTHOS CLAWED HOLD OF SOME PEAS WHICH WERE TWINED ROUND POLES STUCK INTO THE GROUND AND ATE OR RATHER BROWSED UPON THEM SHELLS AND ALL
ANY ONE WHO HAD THE DISTINGUISHED HONOR OF BEING NEAR HIM COULD WISH TO LEAVE HIM SIRE SAID D'ARTAGNAN
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A REPRESENTATION NOW FOR I THINK I HEARD SOMETHING LIKE CHANTING YES SAID D'ARTAGNAN I HEAR SINGING TOO
THE MUSKETEER FELT THAT HE NEEDED SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS TO SATISFY THE CRAVINGS OF HIS NATURE AT EVERY MOMENT ASSAILED BY PEOPLE ASKING HIM HOW DO YOU THINK THIS COSTUME SUITS ME MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN HE WOULD REPLY TO THEM IN QUIET SARCASTIC TONES
SHE STARTED AND TURNED ROUND THINKING IT WAS THE KING WHO HAD RETURNED
BUT SIMPLY PLACED UPON A STOOL FORMED AN ANGLE OF THE MOST OBTUSE FORM THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE SEEN BOTH HIS ARMS WERE CROSSED OVER HIS HEAD HIS HEAD RECLINING UPON HIS LEFT SHOULDER LIKE ALEXANDER THE GREAT HIS EYES
HE MURMURED MADAME DE CHEVREUSE D'ARTAGNAN WOULD NOT GO HOME UNTIL HE HAD LEARNT EVERYTHING
DON'T THINK OF NOT EATING FOR A MOMENT SAID D'ARTAGNAN THAT WOULD PUT HIS MAJESTY OUT TERRIBLY THE KING HAS A SAYING THAT HE WHO WORKS WELL EATS WELL AND HE DOES NOT LIKE PEOPLE TO EAT INDIFFERENTLY AT HIS TABLE
AND ALSO TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE D'ARTAGNAN ASKED THE KING FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR A MATTER OF PRIVATE BUSINESS AT THE MOMENT D'ARTAGNAN MADE HIS REQUEST
HE DID NOT PASS ANY OF THE DISHES TO PORTHOS UNTIL HE HAD TASTED THEM HIMSELF AND HE ACCORDINGLY TOOK SOME OF THE BOAR'S HEAD PORTHOS SHOWED THAT HE COULD KEEP PACE WITH HIS SOVEREIGN
BUT CLING TO THEIR CITIES HEM AS A CHILD TO THE MOTHER'S GOWN NOT SO E RUSHMORE COGLAN WITH THE WHOLE WORLD FOR HIS MY MEDITATIONS WERE INTERRUPTED BY A TREMENDOUS NOISE AND CONFLICT IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CAFE I SAW ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE SEATED PATRONS
OTHER LITTLE TRINKETS SUCH AS THEY KEEP IN DEPARTMENT STORES OF WHAT SHE EARNED DULCIE RECEIVED SIX DOLLARS PER WEEK THE REMAINDER WAS CREDITED TO HER AND DEBITED TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S ACCOUNT IN THE LEDGER KEPT BY G
IT'S THIS OLD BUSINESS THAT HAS DRIVEN EVERYTHING ELSE OUT OF YOUR HEAD FOR THE TIME
FACE DOWNWARD WITH A SEVERE GESTURE
ONCE WHEN WE LEFT HIM UNPAID
AFTER ME OLD FATHER IN CANTRIM YE LIE SAID MISSUS MC CASKEY WITHOUT ANGER ME BROTHER WAS WORTH TIN DOZEN BOG TROTTING MC CASKEYS AFTER HIM WOULD THE BYE BE NAMED SHE LEANED OVER THE WINDOW SILL AND LOOKED DOWN AT THE HURRYING AND BUSTLE BELOW
ITS FACE IS THAT OF A TYRANT ITS NUMBERS ARE FALSE AS THOSE ON A LOTTERY TICKET ITS HANDS ARE THOSE OF A BUNCO STEERER WHO MAKES AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOU TO YOUR RUIN
SAID ANTHONY DECIDEDLY I'VE HEARD OF THESE YOUNG BLOODS SPENDING TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS A DOZEN FOR SOAP AND GOING OVER THE HUNDRED MARK FOR CLOTHES YOU'VE GOT AS MUCH MONEY TO WASTE AS ANY OF EM AND YET YOU STICK TO WHAT'S DECENT AND MODERATE NOW I USE THE OLD EUREKA NOT ONLY FOR SENTIMENT BUT IT'S THE PUREST SOAP MADE
THIS WATCH OF MINE NEVER VARIES A BUT THE CITIZEN WAS TALKING TO VACANCY HE TURNED AND SAW HIS HEARER A FAST RECEDING BLACK SHADOW FLYING IN THE DIRECTION OF A HOUSE WITH THREE LIGHTED UPPER WINDOWS
AND THERE WAS NO ROOM IN IT FOR THE HUMAN WORLD OR THE WORLD OF NATURE WHEN THE LUNCHEON HOUR DREW NEAR THERE CAME A SLIGHT LULL IN THE UPROAR MAXWELL STOOD BY HIS DESK WITH HIS HANDS FULL OF TELEGRAMS AND MEMORANDA
THERE WAS A SECOND HAND STORE IN SEVENTH AVENUE WHERE SOMEBODY KNOCKED AT THE DOOR DULCIE OPENED IT THE LANDLADY STOOD THERE WITH A SPURIOUS SMILE SNIFFING FOR COOKING BY STOLEN GAS
HE KNEW WHAT SHOULD FOLLOW THE ENTREE ON THE TABLE WAS A ROAST SIRLOIN OF PORK GARNISHED WITH SHAMROCKS
AH SAID ANTHONY KEENLY WHAT'S HER NAME RICHARD BEGAN TO WALK UP AND DOWN THE LIBRARY FLOOR THERE WAS ENOUGH COMRADESHIP AND SYMPATHY IN THIS CRUDE OLD FATHER OF HIS TO DRAW HIS CONFIDENCE WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER
SHE MADE COFFEE AND COOKED AN EGG OVER THE GASLIGHT WHILE SHE WAS DRESSING ON SUNDAY MORNINGS SHE FEASTED ROYALLY ON VEAL CHOPS AND PINEAPPLE FRITTERS AT BILLY'S RESTAURANT AT A COST OF TWENTY FIVE CENTS AND TIPPED THE WAITRESS TEN CENTS
I HEARD YE CAME THE ORAL SUBSTITUTES FOR KITCHENWARE
TWILL NOT LAST LONG SURE THEY'LL HAVE TO BORROW MORE DISHES TO KEEP IT UP WITH AND JUST THEN CAME THE LOUD SCREAM BELOW STAIRS BETOKENING FEAR OR DIRE EXTREMITY TIS PROBABLY THE CAT SAID POLICEMAN CLEARY AND WALKED HASTILY IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
BESTOWED HOWEVER WITH WISDOM AND JUDICIOUSNESS AND AS PRINCE MICHAEL'S EYE RESTED UPON THE GLOWING FACE OF THE GREAT CLOCK IN THE TOWER
YOU EXPECTED TO SEE HER COLOSSAL FIGURE LOOM THROUGH THAT REEKING BLUE CLOUD OF SMOKE FROM FRYING FAT JUST AS YOU EXPECT THE PALISADES TO APPEAR THROUGH A DRIFTING HUDSON RIVER FOG
SHE WORE NO CHAINS BRACELETS OR LOCKETS SHE HAD NOT THE AIR OF BEING ABOUT TO ACCEPT AN INVITATION TO LUNCHEON HER DRESS WAS GREY AND PLAIN BUT IT FITTED HER FIGURE WITH FIDELITY AND DISCRETION
HE LEAPED UP AND POUNDED THE KLONDIKER'S BACK COME OUT AND DRINK HE SHOUTED DRINK FIRST AND EAT AFTERWARD JUDKINS SEIZED ONE ARM AND I THE OTHER GAILY ROARINGLY IRRESISTIBLY IN JOLLY GOOD FELLOW STYLE WE DRAGGED HIM FROM THE RESTAURANT TO A CAFE
THE BRILLIANT LIGHT IN THE PRINCE'S EYES WAS SOFTENING TO A DREAMIER CLOUDY TRANSLUCENCE WAIT HE SAID SOLEMNLY TILL THE CLOCK STRIKES I HAVE WEALTH AND POWER AND KNOWLEDGE ABOVE MOST MEN BUT WHEN THE CLOCK STRIKES I AM AFRAID STAY BY ME UNTIL THEN
OF A GREAT ALMOST COSMOPOLITE WHO WROTE FOR THE WHOLE WORLD AND DEDICATED HIMSELF TO BOMBAY IN A POEM HE HAS TO SAY THAT THERE IS PRIDE AND RIVALRY BETWEEN THE CITIES OF THE EARTH AND THAT THE MEN THAT BREED FROM THEM THEY TRAFFIC UP AND DOWN
SUPPER WAS COOLING ON THE TABLE ITS HEAT WENT INTO MISSUS MC CASKEY AT NINE MISTER MC CASKEY CAME HE CARRIED HIS COAT ON HIS ARM AND HIS PIPE IN HIS TEETH AND HE APOLOGISED FOR DISTURBING THE BOARDERS ON THE STEPS AS HE SELECTED SPOTS OF STONE

AND THOSE OF US WHO COULD NOT FOLLOW SUIT WERE ARRAIGNED FOR EXAMINATION I NOTICED AT ONE SIDE A GATHERING OF PROFESSIONAL BONDSMEN IN SOLEMN BLACK AND COLLARS THAT BUTTONED BEHIND BUT IT SEEMED THERE WAS SOME TROUBLE ABOUT THEIR REAL ESTATE TITLES
A CALENDAR ISSUED BY A PICKLE WORKS A BOOK ON THE DIVINATION OF DREAMS SOME RICE POWDER IN A GLASS DISH AND A CLUSTER OF ARTIFICIAL CHERRIES TIED WITH A PINK RIBBON
AND HAD TO BACK AWAY FROM A FURNITURE VAN THAT HAD NO BUSINESS TO BE THERE HE TRIED TO BACK OUT BUT DROPPED HIS REINS AND SWORE DUTIFULLY HE WAS BLOCKADED IN A TANGLED MESS OF VEHICLES AND HORSES
AND WAVED FRANTICALLY HIS SOFT BRIMMED HAT THEN HE STRAYED THROUGH THE SMOKE DROPPED INTO THE VACANT CHAIR AT OUR TABLE AND PULLED OUT CIGARETTES THE EVENING WAS AT THE PERIOD WHEN RESERVE IS THAWED ONE OF US MENTIONED THREE WUERZBURGERS TO THE WAITER

THE ONLY ONE THERE WAS TO APPROVE OR CONDEMN WHAT SHE DID STRAIGHT AND SLENDER AND TALL WITH A LOOK OF SORROWFUL REPROACH ON HIS HANDSOME MELANCHOLY FACE GENERAL KITCHENER
KRAFT WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR SUCH A POLITE BARBED INSULT RELATING TO PEOPLE WHO WERE MISERLY WITH THEIR FUNDS THAT THE MINER CRASHED DOWN HANDFUL AFTER HANDFUL OF SILVER AND NOTES CALLING FOR ALL THE FLUIDS IN THE WORLD TO DROWN THE IMPUTATION
AWKWARDLY MISTER MC CASKEY WITHDREW HIS HAND BUT HE LAID IT AROUND THE NEARING SHOULDER OF HIS WIFE TIS FOOLISHNESS OF COURSE SAID HE ROUGHLY BUT I'D BE CUT UP SOME MESELF IF OUR LITTLE PAT WAS KIDNAPPED OR ANYTHING
THEIR BOND UPON THEIR BOND AND MY GLEE WAS ROUSED BECAUSE I HAD CAUGHT MISTER KIPLING NAPPING HERE I HAD FOUND A MAN NOT MADE FROM DUST ONE WHO HAD NO NARROW BOASTS OF BIRTHPLACE OR COUNTRY
HE WAS RUGGED AND BEARDED AND WIND DRIED HE HAD JUST COME OFF THE TRAIL HE SAID AT ONE OF THE NORTH RIVER FERRIES I FANCIED I COULD SEE THE SNOW DUST OF CHILCOOT YET POWDERING HIS SHOULDERS AND THEN HE STREWED THE TABLE WITH THE NUGGETS
SISTER SAID ANTHONY ROCKWALL I'VE GOT MY PIRATE IN A DEVIL OF A SCRAPE HIS SHIP HAS JUST BEEN SCUTTLED AND HE'S TOO GOOD A JUDGE OF THE VALUE OF MONEY TO LET DROWN I WISH YOU WOULD LET ME GO ON WITH THIS CHAPTER THE STORY SHOULD END HERE
IKEY'S LEFT FOREFINGER WAS DOUBLED OVER THE EDGE OF THE MORTAR HOLDING IT STEADY HE GAVE IT A WILD RAP WITH THE PESTLE BUT FELT IT NOT MEANWHILE MISTER MC GOWAN'S SMILE FADED TO A LOOK OF PERPLEXED GLOOM
WITH HIS SWORD CLANKING AGAINST HIS HIGH BOOTS ONCE WHEN A BOY WAS RATTLING A PIECE OF CHAIN AGAINST A LAMP POST
THE FIST OF E RUSHMORE COGLAN BANGED THE TABLE AND I WAS JARRED INTO SILENCE EXCUSE ME SAID HE BUT THAT'S A QUESTION I NEVER LIKE TO HEAR ASKED WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHERE A MAN IS FROM
SOMETIMES I'VE BEEN UGLY AND HARD WITH YE JUDY FORGET IT THEY LEANED TOGETHER AND LOOKED DOWN AT THE HEART DRAMA BEING ACTED BELOW LONG THEY SAT THUS PEOPLE SURGED ALONG THE SIDEWALK CROWDING QUESTIONING FILLING THE AIR WITH RUMOURS
BUT THAT IS NOT THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY THREE YEARS AGO KRAFT BILL JUDKINS A POET AND I TOOK OUR MEALS AT CYPHER'S ON EIGHTH AVENUE I SAY TOOK WHEN WE HAD MONEY CYPHER GOT IT OFF OF US AS HE EXPRESSED IT WE HAD NO CREDIT
MEN IN ACCURATE CLOTHES WITH FACES LIKE THOSE CARVED ON CHERRY STONES BY THE OLD SALTS IN SAILORS HOMES TURNED AND STARED AT DULCIE AS SHE SPED UNHEEDING PAST THEM MANHATTAN THE NIGHT BLOOMING CEREUS
OUR FEARS MUST HAVE BEEN PROPHETIC FOR ON THAT SAME EVENING THE WILDWOOD DISCHARGED UPON US MILLY'S PREORDAINED CONFISCATOR OUR FEE TO ADJUSTMENT AND ORDER BUT ALASKA AND NOT WISCONSIN BORE THE BURDEN OF THE VISITATION
MAMMON AND THE ARCHER OLD ANTHONY ROCKWALL RETIRED MANUFACTURER AND PROPRIETOR OF ROCKWALL'S EUREKA SOAP LOOKED OUT THE LIBRARY WINDOW OF HIS FIFTH AVENUE MANSION AND GRINNED HIS NEIGHBOUR TO THE RIGHT
AS HE OPENED THE DOOR OF HIS ROOM HE RECEIVED A SURPRISE INSTEAD OF THE USUAL STOVE LID OR POTATO MASHER FOR HIM TO DODGE CAME ONLY WORDS MISTER MC CASKEY RECKONED THAT THE BENIGN MAY MOON HAD SOFTENED THE BREAST OF HIS SPOUSE
AND IN THE MORNING CAME ALONG TWO POLICEMEN ON THEIR WAY TO THE BEATS THEY OWNED THE PARK WAS DESERTED SAVE FOR ONE DILAPIDATED FIGURE THAT SPRAWLED ASLEEP ON A BENCH THEY STOPPED AND GAZED UPON IT IT'S DOPY MIKE SAID ONE HE HITS THE PIPE EVERY NIGHT
FIXED HIS WONDERFUL EYES ON HER OUT OF HIS GILT PHOTOGRAPH FRAME ON THE DRESSER DULCIE TURNED LIKE AN AUTOMATIC DOLL TO THE LANDLADY TELL HIM I CAN'T GO SHE SAID DULLY
TAKE HER FOR A WALK IN THE PARK OR A STRAW RIDE OR WALK HOME WITH HER FROM CHURCH CHANCE PSHAW YOU DON'T KNOW THE SOCIAL MILL DAD SHE'S PART OF THE STREAM THAT TURNS IT EVERY HOUR AND MINUTE OF HER TIME IS ARRANGED FOR DAYS IN ADVANCE

OUR PATHS SEPARATED AND I SAW KRAFT NO MORE AND JUDKINS SELDOM BUT AS I SAID I SAW A PAINTING THE OTHER DAY THAT WAS SOLD FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THE TITLE WAS BOADICEA
I HEAR OF WONDERFUL BARGAINS IN FABRICS AND OF MIRACLES PERFORMED WITH NEEDLE AND THREAD BUT I AM IN DOUBT I HOLD MY PEN POISED IN VAIN WHEN I WOULD ADD TO DULCIE'S LIFE SOME OF THOSE JOYS THAT BELONG TO WOMAN BY VIRTUE OF ALL THE UNWRITTEN SACRED NATURAL
ONCE SHE MOVED OVER BY MAXWELL'S DESK NEAR ENOUGH FOR HIM TO BE AWARE OF HER PRESENCE THE MACHINE SITTING AT THAT DESK WAS NO LONGER A MAN IT WAS A BUSY NEW YORK BROKER MOVED BY BUZZING WHEELS
AND THAT THE WORST WE WICKED ONES MAY EXPECT IS A CHEMICAL REACTION THIS IS A PLEASING HYPOTHESIS BUT THERE LINGERS YET SOME OF THE OLD GOODLY TERROR OF ORTHODOXY
WE CAN'T BUY ONE MINUTE OF TIME WITH CASH IF WE COULD RICH PEOPLE WOULD LIVE LONGER THERE'S NO HOPE OF GETTING A TALK WITH MISS LANTRY BEFORE SHE SAILS
LET A MAN BE A MAN AND DON'T HANDICAP HIM WITH THE LABEL OF ANY SECTION PARDON ME I SAID BUT MY CURIOSITY WAS NOT ALTOGETHER AN IDLE ONE I KNOW THE SOUTH AND WHEN THE BAND PLAYS DIXIE I LIKE TO OBSERVE
OH ANTHONY
IF THERE ARE BUTTERFLIES IN THE DESERT DON'T EAT IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SAID DULCIE
BUT THE CHIEF THING AT CYPHER'S WAS MILLY MILLY WAS A WAITRESS SHE WAS A GRAND EXAMPLE OF KRAFT'S THEORY OF THE ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE SHE BELONGED LARGELY TO WAITING AS MINERVA DID TO THE ART OF SCRAPPING OR VENUS TO THE SCIENCE OF SERIOUS FLIRTATION
TRYING TO COVER HE CHARGED UPON THE DESK OF THE STENOGRAPHER SHE LOOKED UP AT HIM WITH A SMILE A SOFT PINK CREPT OVER HER CHEEK AND HER EYES WERE KIND AND FRANK
NO CALAMITY SO TOUCHES THE COMMON HEART OF HUMANITY AS DOES THE STRAYING OF A LITTLE CHILD THEIR FEET ARE SO UNCERTAIN AND FEEBLE THE WAYS ARE SO STEEP AND STRANGE MAJOR GRIGGS HURRIED DOWN TO THE CORNER AND UP THE AVENUE INTO BILLY'S PLACE
AGAINST THE WRINKLY MIRROR STOOD PICTURES OF GENERAL KITCHENER WILLIAM MULDOON THE DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH AND BENVENUTO CELLINI
SHE SAID TO HER CHUM SADIE THE GIRL THAT WAITS ON YOU WITH HER LEFT SIDE SAY SADE I MADE A DATE FOR DINNER THIS EVENING WITH PIGGY
FIFTEEN CENTS FOR SUPPER TEN CENTS FOR BREAKFAST TEN CENTS FOR LUNCH ANOTHER DIME WAS TO BE ADDED TO HER SMALL STORE OF SAVINGS AND FIVE CENTS WAS TO BE SQUANDERED FOR LICORICE DROPS
I SAT REFLECTING UPON MY EVIDENT COSMOPOLITE AND WONDERING HOW THE POET HAD MANAGED TO MISS HIM HE WAS MY DISCOVERY AND I BELIEVED IN HIM HOW WAS IT THE MEN THAT BREED FROM THEM THEY TRAFFIC UP AND DOWN
I DO NOT ACCEPT YOUR ADDITION WOMEN ARE THE NATURAL ENEMIES OF CLOCKS

THE ORCHESTRA GLIDED INTO A MEDLEY THE CONCLUDING AIR WAS DIXIE
THREE YEARS AGO KRAFT BILL JUDKINS A POET AND I TOOK OUR MEALS AT CYPHER'S ON EIGHTH AVENUE I SAY TOOK WHEN WE HAD MONEY CYPHER GOT IT OFF OF US AS HE EXPRESSED IT

E RUSHMORE COGLAN AND A STRANGER TO ME ENGAGED IN TERRIFIC BATTLE THEY FOUGHT BETWEEN THE TABLES LIKE TITANS AND GLASSES CRASHED AND MEN CAUGHT THEIR HATS UP AND WERE KNOCKED DOWN AND A BRUNETTE SCREAMED AND A BLONDE BEGAN TO SING TEASING
PEDESTALLED AND IN BRONZE SHE MIGHT HAVE STOOD WITH THE NOBLEST OF HER HEROIC SISTERS AS LIVER AND BACON ENLIVENING THE WORLD SHE BELONGED TO CYPHER'S YOU EXPECTED TO SEE HER COLOSSAL FIGURE LOOM THROUGH THAT REEKING BLUE CLOUD OF SMOKE FROM FRYING FAT
PITCHER STILL MILDLY CURIOUS NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN HER WAYS THIS MORNING INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT INTO THE ADJOINING ROOM WHERE HER DESK WAS SHE LINGERED SLIGHTLY IRRESOLUTE IN THE OUTER OFFICE
THE YOUNG MAN GLANCED AT THE CLOCK AGAIN AND FROWNED DARKLY WHEN HIS GAZE STRAYED FROM THE GLOWING HOROLOGUE OF TIME IT RESTED INTENTLY UPON A FOUR STORY RED BRICK HOUSE IN THE ROW OF DWELLINGS OPPOSITE TO WHERE HE SAT THE SHADES WERE DRAWN AND THE LIGHTS IN MANY ROOMS SHONE DIMLY THROUGH THEM

THE SILVER HEART LEFT THE OFFICE SWINGING AND BANGING ITSELF INDEPENDENTLY AGAINST THE OFFICE FURNITURE AS IT INDIGNANTLY DEPARTED PITCHER SEIZED A MOMENT TO REMARK TO THE BOOKKEEPER
TWO GENTLEMEN AND THREE LADIES MARY JANE O HERE'S MISTER BERGIN AND MISTER KERRIGAN SAID MARY JANE MISTER KERRIGAN WILL YOU TAKE MISS POWER MISS FURLONG MAY I GET YOU A PARTNER MISTER BERGIN O THAT'LL JUST DO NOW THREE LADIES MARY JANE

HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD REGRET IN THE MORNING BUT AT PRESENT HE WAS GLAD OF THE REST GLAD OF THE DARK STUPOR THAT WOULD COVER UP HIS FOLLY HE LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND RESTED HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS HANDS COUNTING THE BEATS OF HIS TEMPLES
ONE GOT THE PRAYER BOOK AND THE OTHER THREE GOT THE WATER AND WHEN ONE OF THE NEXT DOOR GIRLS GOT THE RING MISSUS DONNELLY SHOOK HER FINGER AT THE BLUSHING GIRL AS MUCH AS TO SAY O I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT

AS IF THE QUESTION HAD SURPRISED HER IT'S ONLY FREDDY KATE AND GABRIEL WITH HIM IN FACT RIGHT BEHIND HER GABRIEL COULD BE SEEN PILOTING FREDDY MALINS ACROSS THE LANDING THE LATTER A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FORTY WAS OF GABRIEL'S SIZE AND BUILD WITH VERY ROUND SHOULDERS
AND I THINK WE'RE IN FOR A NIGHT OF IT HE LOOKED UP AT THE PANTRY CEILING WHICH WAS SHAKING WITH THE STAMPING AND SHUFFLING OF FEET ON THE FLOOR ABOVE LISTENED FOR A MOMENT TO THE PIANO AND THEN GLANCED AT THE GIRL WHO WAS FOLDING HIS OVERCOAT CAREFULLY AT THE END OF A SHELF
HIS FACE WHICH CARRIED THE ENTIRE TALE OF HIS YEARS WAS OF THE BROWN TINT OF DUBLIN STREETS ON HIS LONG AND RATHER LARGE HEAD GREW DRY BLACK HAIR AND A TAWNY MOUSTACHE DID NOT QUITE COVER AN UNAMIABLE MOUTH
AND THIS TIME SHE GOT THE PRAYER BOOK AFTER THAT MISSUS DONNELLY PLAYED MISS MC CLOUD'S REEL FOR THE CHILDREN AND JOE MADE MARIA TAKE A GLASS OF WINE SOON THEY WERE ALL QUITE MERRY AGAIN
SHE WAS ALWAYS SENT FOR WHEN THE WOMEN QUARRELLED OVER THEIR TUBS AND ALWAYS SUCCEEDED IN MAKING PEACE ONE DAY THE MATRON HAD SAID TO HER MARIA YOU ARE A VERITABLE PEACE MAKER
AND SHE LOOKED WITH QUAINT AFFECTION AT THE DIMINUTIVE BODY WHICH SHE HAD SO OFTEN ADORNED IN SPITE OF ITS YEARS SHE FOUND IT A NICE TIDY LITTLE BODY WHEN SHE GOT OUTSIDE THE STREETS WERE SHINING WITH RAIN
BUT AS THESE CIRCUMSTANCES NEVER AROSE HIS LIFE ROLLED OUT EVENLY AN ADVENTURELESS TALE ONE EVENING HE FOUND HIMSELF SITTING BESIDE TWO LADIES IN THE ROTUNDA THE HOUSE THINLY PEOPLED AND SILENT
HE ENTANGLED HIS THOUGHTS WITH HERS HE LENT HER BOOKS PROVIDED HER WITH IDEAS SHARED HIS INTELLECTUAL LIFE WITH HER SHE LISTENED TO ALL SOMETIMES IN RETURN FOR HIS THEORIES SHE GAVE OUT SOME FACT OF HER OWN LIFE
INSISTING ON THE SOUL'S INCURABLE LONELINESS WE CANNOT GIVE OURSELVES IT SAID WE ARE OUR OWN THE END OF THESE DISCOURSES WAS THAT ONE NIGHT DURING WHICH SHE HAD SHOWN EVERY SIGN OF UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT
HIS FATHER WHO HAD BEGUN LIFE AS AN ADVANCED NATIONALIST HAD MODIFIED HIS VIEWS EARLY HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY AS A BUTCHER IN KINGSTOWN AND BY OPENING SHOPS IN DUBLIN AND IN THE SUBURBS HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY MANY TIMES OVER
THREE SHILLING TEA AND THE BEST BOTTLED STOUT BUT LILY SELDOM MADE A MISTAKE IN THE ORDERS SO THAT SHE GOT ON WELL WITH HER THREE MISTRESSES THEY WERE FUSSY THAT WAS ALL BUT THE ONLY THING THEY WOULD NOT STAND WAS BACK ANSWERS OF COURSE
MARIA SUPERINTENDED THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BARMBRACK AND SAW THAT EVERY WOMAN GOT HER FOUR SLICES THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF LAUGHING AND JOKING DURING THE MEAL
VILLONA SAYING HEAR HEAR WHENEVER THERE WAS A PAUSE THERE WAS A GREAT CLAPPING OF HANDS WHEN HE SAT DOWN IT MUST HAVE BEEN A GOOD SPEECH FARLEY CLAPPED HIM ON THE BACK AND LAUGHED LOUDLY WHAT JOVIAL FELLOWS WHAT GOOD COMPANY THEY WERE CARDS CARDS
WHO HAD SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AND WAS REPUTED TO OWN SOME OF THE BIGGEST HOTELS IN FRANCE SUCH A PERSON AS HIS FATHER AGREED WAS WELL WORTH KNOWING EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THE CHARMING COMPANION HE WAS
AND SEIZED THE MOMENTS WHEN HER DAUGHTER'S ATTENTION WAS DIVERTED TO BECOME INTIMATE SHE ALLUDED ONCE OR TWICE TO HER HUSBAND BUT HER TONE WAS NOT SUCH AS TO MAKE THE ALLUSION A WARNING HER NAME WAS MISSUS SINICO
VERY JOLLY IT WAS GRETTA CAUGHT A DREADFUL COLD AUNT KATE FROWNED SEVERELY AND NODDED HER HEAD AT EVERY WORD QUITE RIGHT GABRIEL QUITE RIGHT SHE SAID YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL BUT AS FOR GRETTA THERE SAID GABRIEL SHE'D WALK HOME IN THE SNOW IF SHE WERE LET
A COMPLETE WORDSWORTH STOOD AT ONE END OF THE LOWEST SHELF AND A COPY OF THE MAYNOOTH CATECHISM SEWN INTO THE CLOTH COVER OF A NOTEBOOK STOOD AT ONE END OF THE TOP SHELF WRITING MATERIALS WERE ALWAYS ON THE DESK
THAT GABRIEL IS HERE I ALWAYS FEEL EASIER IN MY MIND WHEN HE'S HERE JULIA THERE'S MISS DALY AND MISS POWER WILL TAKE SOME REFRESHMENT THANKS FOR YOUR BEAUTIFUL WALTZ MISS DALY IT MADE LOVELY TIME
EACH BLUE CAR THEREFORE RECEIVED A DOUBLE MEASURE OF WELCOME AS IT TOPPED THE CREST OF THE HILL AND EACH CHEER OF WELCOME WAS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH SMILES AND NODS BY THOSE IN THE CAR IN ONE OF THESE TRIMLY BUILT CARS WAS A PARTY OF FOUR YOUNG MEN WHOSE SPIRITS SEEMED TO BE AT PRESENT
HE JUDGED HER TO BE A YEAR OR SO YOUNGER THAN HIMSELF HER FACE WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN HANDSOME HAD REMAINED INTELLIGENT IT WAS AN OVAL FACE WITH STRONGLY MARKED FEATURES THE EYES WERE VERY DARK BLUE AND STEADY
AND FINDING THAT THEY WERE COMPELLED TO MEET STEALTHILY HE FORCED HER TO ASK HIM TO HER HOUSE CAPTAIN SINICO ENCOURAGED HIS VISITS THINKING THAT HIS DAUGHTER'S HAND WAS IN QUESTION HE HAD DISMISSED HIS WIFE SO SINCERELY FROM HIS GALLERY OF PLEASURES
HIS HEAVY LIDDED EYES AND THE DISORDER OF HIS SCANTY HAIR MADE HIM LOOK SLEEPY HE WAS LAUGHING
O NO HARDLY NOTICEABLE NOW ISN'T HE A TERRIBLE FELLOW SHE SAID AND HIS POOR MOTHER MADE HIM TAKE THE PLEDGE ON NEW YEAR'S EVE
SO MARIA LET HIM HAVE HIS WAY AND THEY SAT BY THE FIRE TALKING OVER OLD TIMES AND MARIA THOUGHT SHE WOULD PUT IN A GOOD WORD FOR ALPHY BUT JOE CRIED THAT GOD MIGHT STRIKE HIM STONE DEAD IF EVER HE SPOKE A WORD TO HIS BROTHER AGAIN
MISSUS DONNELLY SAID DO PLEASE MARIA AND SO MARIA HAD TO GET UP AND STAND BESIDE THE PIANO MISSUS DONNELLY BADE THE CHILDREN BE QUIET AND LISTEN TO MARIA'S SONG THEN SHE PLAYED THE PRELUDE AND SAID NOW MARIA
AND PULLING DOWN THE SLEEVES OF THEIR BLOUSES OVER THEIR RED STEAMING ARMS THEY SETTLED DOWN BEFORE THEIR HUGE MUGS WHICH THE COOK AND THE DUMMY FILLED UP WITH HOT TEA ALREADY MIXED WITH MILK AND SUGAR IN HUGE TIN CANS
AND THE SUB MATRON AND TWO OF THE BOARD LADIES HAD HEARD THE COMPLIMENT AND GINGER MOONEY WAS ALWAYS SAYING WHAT SHE WOULDN'T DO TO THE DUMMY WHO HAD CHARGE OF THE IRONS IF IT WASN'T FOR MARIA EVERYONE WAS SO FOND OF MARIA
THAT FEARING ANOTHER COLLAPSE ON HER PART HE BADE HER GOOD BYE QUICKLY AND LEFT HER A FEW DAYS LATER HE RECEIVED A PARCEL CONTAINING HIS BOOKS AND MUSIC FOUR YEARS PASSED MISTER DUFFY RETURNED TO HIS EVEN WAY OF LIFE
SOMEBODY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THE GARDEN AND AT LAST MISSUS DONNELLY SAID SOMETHING VERY CROSS TO ONE OF THE NEXT DOOR GIRLS AND TOLD HER TO THROW IT OUT AT ONCE THAT WAS NO PLAY MARIA UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS WRONG THAT TIME AND SO SHE HAD TO DO IT OVER AGAIN
AT THE CONTROL SEGOUIN HAD PRESENTED HIM TO ONE OF THE FRENCH COMPETITORS AND IN ANSWER TO HIS CONFUSED MURMUR OF COMPLIMENT THE SWARTHY FACE OF THE DRIVER HAD DISCLOSED A LINE OF SHINING WHITE TEETH
AND BESIDES HE WAS AN OPTIMIST BY NATURE THE FOURTH MEMBER OF THE PARTY HOWEVER WAS TOO EXCITED TO BE GENUINELY HAPPY HE WAS ABOUT TWENTY SIX YEARS OF AGE WITH A SOFT LIGHT BROWN MOUSTACHE AND RATHER INNOCENT LOOKING GREY EYES
AT FOUR O'CLOCK HE WAS SET FREE HE DINED IN AN EATING HOUSE IN GEORGE'S STREET WHERE HE FELT HIMSELF SAFE FROM THE SOCIETY OF DUBLIN'S GILDED YOUTH AND WHERE THERE WAS A CERTAIN PLAIN HONESTY IN THE BILL OF FARE
ON THE SIDEBOARD WERE ARRAYED DISHES AND PLATES AND GLASSES AND BUNDLES OF KNIVES AND FORKS AND SPOONS THE TOP OF THE CLOSED SQUARE PIANO SERVED ALSO AS A SIDEBOARD FOR VIANDS AND SWEETS AT A SMALLER SIDEBOARD IN ONE CORNER
CAB WINDOWS RATTLING ALL THE WAY
TO A MUSIC OF MERRY BELLS
IT WAS A TERRIBLE GAME THEY STOPPED JUST BEFORE THE END OF IT TO DRINK FOR LUCK JIMMY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GAME LAY BETWEEN ROUTH AND SEGOUIN WHAT EXCITEMENT JIMMY WAS EXCITED TOO HE WOULD LOSE OF COURSE HOW MUCH HAD HE WRITTEN AWAY
GRETTA THINKS IT VERY FUNNY BECAUSE SHE SAYS THE WORD REMINDS HER OF CHRISTY MINSTRELS
AND MISSUS DONNELLY SAID MARIA WOULD ENTER A CONVENT BEFORE THE YEAR WAS OUT BECAUSE SHE HAD GOT THE PRAYER BOOK MARIA HAD NEVER SEEN JOE SO NICE TO HER AS HE WAS THAT NIGHT SO FULL OF PLEASANT TALK AND REMINISCENCES
RIVIERE NOT WHOLLY INGENUOUSLY UNDERTOOK TO EXPLAIN TO JIMMY THE TRIUMPH OF THE FRENCH MECHANICIANS THE RESONANT VOICE OF THE HUNGARIAN WAS ABOUT TO PREVAIL IN RIDICULE OF THE SPURIOUS LUTES OF THE ROMANTIC PAINTERS
TELL ME LILY HE SAID IN A FRIENDLY TONE
AND RIVIERE WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE WAS TO BE APPOINTED MANAGER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT THESE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE COUSINS WERE ALSO IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE FRENCH CARS VILLONA WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD HAD A VERY SATISFACTORY LUNCHEON
JIMMY HAD A RESPECT FOR HIS FATHER'S SHREWDNESS IN BUSINESS MATTERS AND IN THIS CASE IT HAD BEEN HIS FATHER WHO HAD FIRST SUGGESTED THE INVESTMENT MONEY TO BE MADE IN THE MOTOR BUSINESS POTS OF MONEY MOREOVER SEGOUIN HAD THE UNMISTAKABLE AIR OF WEALTH
THESE WERE THE ONLY DISSIPATIONS OF HIS LIFE HE HAD NEITHER COMPANIONS NOR FRIENDS CHURCH NOR CREED HE LIVED HIS SPIRITUAL LIFE WITHOUT ANY COMMUNION WITH OTHERS VISITING HIS RELATIVES AT CHRISTMAS
SHE USED TO HAVE SUCH A BAD OPINION OF PROTESTANTS BUT NOW SHE THOUGHT THEY WERE VERY NICE PEOPLE A LITTLE QUIET AND SERIOUS BUT STILL VERY NICE PEOPLE TO LIVE WITH
AND GALLANTLY THE MACHINERY OF HUMAN NERVES STROVE TO ANSWER THE BOUNDING COURSES OF THE SWIFT BLUE ANIMAL THEY DROVE DOWN DAME STREET THE STREET WAS BUSY WITH UNUSUAL TRAFFIC LOUD WITH THE HORNS OF MOTORISTS AND THE GONGS OF IMPATIENT TRAM DRIVERS
THE MUSIC THAT STILL VIBRATED IN THEIR EARS UNITED THEM THIS UNION EXALTED HIM WORE AWAY THE ROUGH EDGES OF HIS CHARACTER EMOTIONALISED HIS MENTAL LIFE SOMETIMES HE CAUGHT HIMSELF LISTENING TO THE SOUND OF HIS OWN VOICE
WE BOTH HAVE A PAIR NOW GABRIEL SAYS EVERYONE WEARS THEM ON THE CONTINENT O ON THE CONTINENT MURMURED AUNT JULIA NODDING HER HEAD SLOWLY GABRIEL KNITTED HIS BROWS AND SAID AS IF HE WERE SLIGHTLY ANGERED IT'S NOTHING VERY WONDERFUL BUT
MAMMA IS MAMMA BUT MARIA IS MY PROPER MOTHER AFTER THE BREAK UP AT HOME THE BOYS HAD GOT HER THAT POSITION IN THE DUBLIN BY LAMPLIGHT LAUNDRY AND SHE LIKED IT
THEY TALKED VOLUBLY AND WITH LITTLE RESERVE JIMMY WHOSE IMAGINATION WAS KINDLING CONCEIVED THE LIVELY YOUTH OF THE FRENCHMEN TWINED ELEGANTLY UPON THE FIRM FRAMEWORK OF THE ENGLISHMAN'S MANNER A GRACEFUL IMAGE OF HIS HE THOUGHT AND A JUST ONE
AS THE PIANO HAD TWICE BEGUN THE PRELUDE TO THE FIRST FIGURE MARY JANE LED HER RECRUITS QUICKLY FROM THE ROOM THEY HAD HARDLY GONE WHEN AUNT JULIA WANDERED SLOWLY INTO THE ROOM LOOKING BEHIND HER AT SOMETHING WHAT IS THE MATTER JULIA ASKED AUNT KATE ANXIOUSLY WHO IS IT
LIZZIE FLEMING SAID MARIA WAS SURE TO GET THE RING AND THOUGH FLEMING HAD SAID THAT FOR SO MANY HALLOW EVES MARIA HAD TO LAUGH AND SAY SHE DIDN'T WANT ANY RING OR MAN EITHER
SAID LILY TO GABRIEL WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM MISS KATE AND MISS JULIA THOUGHT YOU WERE NEVER COMING GOOD NIGHT MISSUS CONROY I'LL ENGAGE THEY DID SAID GABRIEL BUT THEY FORGET THAT MY WIFE HERE TAKES THREE MORTAL HOURS TO DRESS HERSELF
AND MARIA LAUGHED AGAIN TILL THE TIP OF HER NOSE NEARLY MET THE TIP OF HER CHIN AND TILL HER MINUTE BODY NEARLY SHOOK ITSELF ASUNDER BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT MOONEY MEANT WELL THOUGH OF COURSE
THERE WAS ONE THING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND THAT WAS THE TRACTS ON THE WALKS BUT THE MATRON WAS SUCH A NICE PERSON TO DEAL WITH SO GENTEEL WHEN THE COOK TOLD HER EVERYTHING WAS READY
THE HIGH COLOUR OF HIS CHEEKS PUSHED UPWARDS EVEN TO HIS FOREHEAD WHERE IT SCATTERED ITSELF IN A FEW FORMLESS PATCHES OF PALE RED AND ON HIS HAIRLESS FACE THERE SCINTILLATED RESTLESSLY THE POLISHED LENSES AND THE BRIGHT GILT RIMS OF THE GLASSES WHICH SCREENED HIS DELICATE AND RESTLESS EYES
AFTER A PAUSE SHE ASKED AND WHAT ARE GOLOSHES GABRIEL GOLOSHES JULIA EXCLAIMED HER SISTER GOODNESS ME DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT GOLOSHES ARE YOU WEAR THEM OVER YOUR OVER YOUR BOOTS GRETTA ISN'T IT YES SAID MISSUS CONROY GUTTAPERCHA THINGS
AND HER TINY DRESS BOOTS BESIDE THE FOOT OF THE BED SHE CHANGED HER BLOUSE TOO AND AS SHE STOOD BEFORE THE MIRROR SHE THOUGHT OF HOW SHE USED TO DRESS FOR MASS ON SUNDAY MORNING WHEN SHE WAS A YOUNG GIRL
BUT OFTEN DISAPPOINTED HE LIVED AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM HIS BODY REGARDING HIS OWN ACTS WITH DOUBTFUL SIDE GLANCES HE HAD AN ODD AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL HABIT WHICH LED HIM TO COMPOSE IN HIS MIND FROM TIME TO TIME
AND HIS MANNER EXPRESSED A REAL RESPECT FOR FOREIGN ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT THIS SUBTLETY OF HIS HOST WAS PROBABLY LOST UPON THE HUNGARIAN WHO WAS BEGINNING TO HAVE A SHARP DESIRE FOR HIS DINNER THE DINNER WAS EXCELLENT EXQUISITE
THE GIRL SEEING THAT HE HAD GAINED THE STAIRS CALLED OUT AFTER HIM WELL THANK YOU SIR HE WAITED OUTSIDE THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR UNTIL THE WALTZ SHOULD FINISH LISTENING TO THE SKIRTS THAT SWEPT AGAINST IT AND TO THE SHUFFLING OF FEET
HIS FATHER REMONSTRATIVE BUT COVERTLY PROUD OF THE EXCESS HAD PAID HIS BILLS AND BROUGHT HIM HOME
HE CONTINUED SCRAPING HIS FEET VIGOROUSLY WHILE THE THREE WOMEN WENT UPSTAIRS LAUGHING TO THE LADIES DRESSING ROOM A LIGHT FRINGE OF SNOW LAY LIKE A CAPE ON THE SHOULDERS OF HIS OVERCOAT
IT WAS HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO BUY AND ALL SHE COULD THINK OF WAS CAKE
MARIA REMEMBERING HOW CONFUSED THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE GREYISH MOUSTACHE HAD MADE HER COLOURED WITH SHAME AND VEXATION AND DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE THOUGHT OF THE FAILURE OF HER LITTLE SURPRISE AND OF THE TWO AND FOURPENCE SHE HAD THROWN AWAY FOR NOTHING
AND BECAUSE HE FOUND ALL THE OTHER SUBURBS OF DUBLIN MEAN MODERN AND PRETENTIOUS HE LIVED IN AN OLD SOMBRE HOUSE AND FROM HIS WINDOWS HE COULD LOOK INTO THE DISUSED DISTILLERY OR UPWARDS ALONG THE SHALLOW RIVER ON WHICH DUBLIN IS BUILT
AS HE DID NOT WISH THEIR LAST INTERVIEW TO BE TROUBLED BY THE INFLUENCE OF THEIR RUINED CONFESSIONAL THEY MET IN A LITTLE CAKESHOP NEAR THE PARKGATE IT WAS COLD AUTUMN WEATHER BUT IN SPITE OF THE COLD THEY WANDERED UP AND DOWN THE ROADS OF THE PARK FOR NEARLY THREE HOURS
THE GIRL GLANCED BACK AT HIM OVER HER SHOULDER AND SAID WITH GREAT BITTERNESS
AND GLANCED AT HER SHE WAS A SLIM GROWING GIRL PALE IN COMPLEXION AND WITH HAY COLOURED HAIR THE GAS IN THE PANTRY MADE HER LOOK STILL PALER GABRIEL HAD KNOWN HER WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD AND USED TO SIT ON THE LOWEST STEP NURSING A RAG DOLL YES LILY HE ANSWERED
THIS WAS NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASANT FOR HIM AS HE HAD NEARLY ALWAYS TO MAKE A DEFT GUESS AT THE MEANING AND SHOUT BACK A SUITABLE ANSWER IN THE FACE OF A HIGH WIND BESIDES VILLONA'S HUMMING WOULD CONFUSE ANYBODY THE NOISE OF THE CAR TOO
A TALL WIZEN FACED MAN WITH A STIFF GRIZZLED MOUSTACHE AND SWARTHY SKIN WHO WAS PASSING OUT WITH HIS PARTNER SAID AND MAY WE HAVE SOME REFRESHMENT TOO MISS MORKAN
WERE TO GO HOME TO DRESS THE CAR STEERED OUT SLOWLY FOR GRAFTON STREET WHILE THE TWO YOUNG MEN PUSHED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE KNOT OF GAZERS THEY WALKED NORTHWARD WITH A CURIOUS FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE EXERCISE WHILE THE CITY HUNG ITS PALE GLOBES OF LIGHT ABOVE THEM
THEN AN IMPROMPTU SQUARE DANCE THE MEN DEVISING ORIGINAL FIGURES WHAT MERRIMENT JIMMY TOOK HIS PART WITH A WILL THIS WAS SEEING LIFE AT LEAST THEN FARLEY GOT OUT OF BREATH AND CRIED STOP
MADAME MERLE RAISED HER EYES I SHALL GO TO AMERICA
ONE HASN'T A NERVE IN ONE'S BODY THAT SHE DOESN'T SET QUIVERING YOU KNOW I NEVER HAVE ADMITTED THAT SHE'S A WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE REMINDS ME OF OF A NEW STEEL PEN THE MOST ODIOUS THING IN NATURE
THEN AS SHE HEARD HER OWN WORDS A DEEP PURE BLUSH CAME INTO HER FACE ISABEL READ THE MEANING OF IT SHE SAW THE POOR GIRL HAD BEEN VANQUISHED
BUT WONDER WITH PANSY HAD NEVER BEEN A REASON FOR NON COMPLIANCE I NEVER WILL AGAIN SHE SAID WITH EXQUISITE GENTLENESS AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE THEY HAD TO SEPARATE AS IT APPEARED TO BE PART OF THE MILD
REMARKING THAT THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT ANSWER HIS LETTERS SHE WOULD PERHAPS NOT WHOLLY CLOSE HER EARS TO HIS SPOKEN ELOQUENCE SHE REPLIED THAT HER STEPDAUGHTER WAS CLOSE AT HAND
TRUST ME AS IF I HAD THE CARE OF YOU WHY SHOULDN'T WE BE HAPPY WHEN IT'S HERE BEFORE US WHEN IT'S SO EASY I'M YOURS FOR EVER FOR EVER AND EVER HERE I STAND I'M AS FIRM AS A ROCK WHAT HAVE YOU TO CARE ABOUT
AS IT EXCEEDED THE LITTLE INTERROGATORY TO WHICH SHE HAD DEEMED IT NECESSARY TO SUBMIT ON HER ARRIVAL BESIDES SHE HAD NEVER BEEN LESS INTERESTED IN LITERATURE THAN TO DAY
HE HAS THE MERIT FOR PANSY OF BEING IN LOVE WITH PANSY SHE CAN SEE AT A GLANCE THAT LORD WARBURTON ISN'T HE'D BE VERY GOOD TO HER SAID RALPH HE HAS BEEN GOOD TO HER ALREADY
NO IT'S MY OWN PROPOSAL I THINK I HAD BETTER WAIT THEN DID PAPA SEND ME NO MESSAGE I DON'T THINK HE KNEW I WAS COMING
YOU'LL FIND YOURSELVES THINKING VERY DIFFERENTLY HE CONTINUED THAT MAY EASILY HAPPEN AMONG THE MOST UNITED COUPLES SHE TOOK UP HER PARASOL HE SAW SHE WAS NERVOUS AFRAID OF WHAT HE MIGHT SAY
BECAUSE PAPA THINKS IT BEST HE SAYS A YOUNG GIRL'S BETTER EVERY NOW AND THEN FOR MAKING A LITTLE RETREAT
SHE HAD WANTED HELP AND HERE WAS HELP IT HAD COME IN A RUSHING TORRENT I KNOW NOT WHETHER SHE BELIEVED EVERYTHING HE SAID BUT SHE BELIEVED JUST THEN THAT TO LET HIM TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS WOULD BE THE NEXT BEST THING TO HER DYING THIS BELIEF FOR A MOMENT
SHE COULDN'T HELP IT AND HIS UNHAPPINESS WAS A GRIM REALITY SHE HAD CRIED WITH RAGE AFTER HE HAD LEFT HER AT SHE HARDLY KNEW WHAT
THE PORTRESS LEFT HER TO WAIT IN THE PARLOUR OF THE CONVENT WHILE SHE WENT TO MAKE IT KNOWN THAT THERE WAS A VISITOR FOR THE DEAR YOUNG LADY THE PARLOUR WAS A VAST COLD APARTMENT WITH NEW LOOKING FURNITURE
PANSY'S SUPREME SIMPLICITY AN INNOCENCE EVEN MORE COMPLETE THAN ISABEL HAD YET JUDGED IT GAVE TO THE MOST TENTATIVE ENQUIRY SOMETHING OF THE EFFECT OF AN ADMONITION AS SHE KNELT THERE IN THE VAGUE FIRELIGHT WITH HER PRETTY DRESS DIMLY SHINING
A STATIONARY AFFECTION IN OTHER WORDS WAS IMPOSSIBLE IT MUST MOVE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER HOWEVER THAT MIGHT BE THE GIRL HAD IN THESE DAYS A THOUSAND USES FOR HER SENSE OF THE ROMANTIC WHICH WAS MORE ACTIVE THAN IT HAD EVER BEEN
OR BECAUSE SUCH A VOICE IN THE DARKNESS SEEMED OF NECESSITY A BOON BUT SHE LISTENED TO HIM AS SHE HAD NEVER LISTENED BEFORE HIS WORDS DROPPED DEEP INTO HER SOUL THEY PRODUCED A SORT OF STILLNESS IN ALL HER BEING
AND I'M ALSO VERY FOND OF MOTHER CATHERINE I SHALL BE VERY QUIET AND THINK A GREAT DEAL ISABEL LISTENED TO HER HOLDING HER BREATH SHE WAS ALMOST AWE STRUCK
AS HE WALKED BESIDE HIS HOSTESS LORD WARBURTON KEPT HIS HANDS RATHER STIFFLY BEHIND HIM AND HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND BOTH PERSONS APPARENTLY WERE SILENT
I'VE NOT MUCH TIME WHILE SHE LOOKED ABOUT HER FOR THE PROPER EGRESS THE DOOR OPENED AND ADMITTED ONE OF THE LADIES OF THE HOUSE WHO ADVANCED WITH A DISCREET SMILE GENTLY RUBBING UNDER HER LONG LOOSE SLEEVES A PAIR OF PLUMP WHITE HANDS
AND YET IN SPITE OF THIS FAMILIAR LOOK THERE WAS A STRANGENESS IN HIS FIGURE TOO SOMETHING THAT MADE HER FEEL IT AFRESH
A PECULIAR CONCUSSION IT WAS DEFICIENT IN THE SOCIAL DRAPERY COMMONLY MUFFLING IN AN OVERCIVILIZED AGE THE SHARPNESS OF HUMAN CONTACTS HIS PERFECT SILENCE MOREOVER
IT'S VERY ABSURD MY DEAR OSMOND SHE SAID TO INVENT SO MANY PRETTY REASONS FOR POOR PANSY'S BANISHMENT WHY DON'T YOU SAY AT ONCE THAT YOU WANT TO GET HER OUT OF MY WAY HAVEN'T YOU DISCOVERED THAT I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ROSIER I DO INDEED
WE KNOW OURSELVES THAT ISABEL HAD MADE CONQUESTS WHETHER INFERIOR OR NOT TO THOSE SHE MIGHT HAVE EFFECTED IN HER NATIVE LAND
AND HAD LET HER EYES WANDER AS FAR AS THE LIMITS OF THE ROOM WOULD ALLOW SHE WISHED NEVER TO LOOK AT MADAME MERLE AGAIN YOU'RE SURPRISED TO FIND ME HERE AND I'M AFRAID YOU'RE NOT PLEASED THIS LADY WENT ON
SHE APPARENTLY HAD FULFILLED THE NECESSARY CONDITION FOR THE NEXT MORNING IN THE COLD FAINT DAWN SHE KNEW THAT A SPIRIT WAS STANDING BY HER BED SHE HAD LAIN DOWN WITHOUT UNDRESSING IT BEING HER BELIEF THAT RALPH WOULD NOT OUTLAST THE NIGHT
IT WAS WHAT SHE WAS DOING FOR OSMOND IT WAS WHAT ONE HAD TO DO FOR OSMOND PANSY'S SOLEMN EYES FIXED ON HER OWN ALMOST EMBARRASSED HER SHE WAS ASHAMED TO THINK SHE HAD MADE SO LIGHT OF THE GIRL'S PREFERENCE WHAT SHOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO
SHE SEEMED READY TO RETIRE HOW DOES THIS DEAR CHILD LOOK SHE ASKED OF ISABEL LINGERING A MOMENT SHE LOOKS PALE ISABEL ANSWERED THAT'S THE PLEASURE OF SEEING YOU SHE'S VERY HAPPY
THAT SHE'LL MARRY ANOTHER NOBLEMAN WHAT OTHER NOBLEMAN ONE THAT HE'LL PICK OUT ROSIER SLOWLY GOT UP PUTTING HIS WATCH INTO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET YOU'RE LAUGHING AT SOME ONE
AND SHE WAS HAPPY TO SAY SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO SHOW HIM CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION
WAS THAT OF A MAN NOT SO MUCH OFFERING AN EXPLANATION AS PUTTING A THING INTO WORDS ALMOST INTO PICTURES TO SEE HIMSELF HOW IT WOULD LOOK HE CONSIDERED A WHILE THE PICTURE HE HAD EVOKED AND SEEMED GREATLY PLEASED WITH IT AND THEN HE WENT ON
AT BOTTOM IT'S HIM YOU'VE TO THANK SHE STOPPED THERE WAS SOMETHING IN ISABEL'S EYES I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU IT WAS MY UNCLE'S MONEY YES IT WAS YOUR UNCLE'S MONEY
VERY DISTINCTLY THERE AND SOMETHING IN HIS ATTITUDE SEEMED TO SAY THAT HE WAS THERE WITH A COMPLEX INTENTION SHE WOULDN'T MEET HIS EYES THOUGH THERE WAS DOUBTLESS SYMPATHY IN THEM HE MADE HER RATHER UNEASY
WHILE THE TWO OTHERS MET AND EMBRACED SHE'S GLAD TO SEE YOU SHE REPEATED IT WILL DO HER GOOD AND SHE PLACED THE BEST CHAIR CAREFULLY FOR ISABEL BUT SHE MADE NO MOVEMENT TO SEAT HERSELF
EVEN A LITTLE OF HIS UNRECONCILED STATE AS SHE DOUBTED OF LORD WARBURTON'S UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS BEYOND QUESTION AND THIS AGGRESSIVE UNCOMPROMISING LOOK OF IT WAS JUST WHAT MADE IT UNATTRACTIVE
MISSUS LUDLOW'S MENTAL MOTIONS WERE SUFFICIENTLY VARIOUS
WERE WE BORN TO BE AFRAID I NEVER KNEW YOU AFRAID IF YOU'LL ONLY TRUST ME HOW LITTLE YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED
HENRIETTA GAVE A LAUGH DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE RATHER TOO CONSIDERATE IT'S NOT OF HIM THAT I'M CONSIDERATE IT'S OF MYSELF ISABEL ANSWERED IT WAS NOT SURPRISING
THERE HAS BEEN A QUESTION OF THAT SOME ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE BEEN READY TO ASK YOU I DON'T THINK HE CAN HAVE BEEN READY SAID PANSY IT WOULD APPEAR SO IF HE HAD BEEN SURE HE'D SUCCEED
HAD NOT BEEN A FORTNIGHT IN ROME BEFORE SHE PROPOSED TO MADAME MERLE THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE PILGRIMAGE TO THE EAST MADAME MERLE REMARKED THAT HER FRIEND WAS RESTLESS
ONE OR TWO PERSONS STILL HAVE THE PERVERSITY TO THINK HIM DIMINUTIVE I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE WHILE I WAS AWAY HE WENT ON WHAT DOES MISTER OSMOND EXPECT AFTER SHE HAS REFUSED LORD WARBURTON
THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT OVERWHELMED HER SHE BOWED HER PRETTY HEAD TO AUTHORITY AND ONLY ASKED OF AUTHORITY TO BE MERCIFUL YES
TO LEAVE MADAME MERLE IN THIS UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION SHE LEFT HER THERE FOR A PERIOD THAT MUST HAVE SEEMED LONG TO THIS LADY WHO AT LAST SEATED HERSELF WITH A MOVEMENT WHICH WAS IN ITSELF A CONFESSION
THE NEW CONVENIENCES OF HER OWN SITUATION MISSUS TOUCHETT WAS NOT AN OPTIMIST BUT EVEN FROM PAINFUL OCCURRENCES SHE MANAGED TO EXTRACT A CERTAIN UTILITY THIS CONSISTED IN THE REFLEXION THAT AFTER ALL
LOOKS AS IF SHE KEPT ALL THE BACK NUMBERS AND WOULD BRING THEM OUT SOME DAY AGAINST ME SHE COULD NOT TEACH HERSELF TO THINK FAVOURABLY OF PANSY WHOSE ABSENCE OF INITIATIVE OF CONVERSATION OF PERSONAL CLAIMS SEEMED TO HER
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THEY MEANT THAT HIS SIMPLICITY WAS AN AFFECTATION SOME OF HIS QUESTIONS WERE TOO DISCOURAGING HE THOUGHT ALL THE CHAMBERMAIDS WERE FARMERS DAUGHTERS OR ALL THE FARMERS DAUGHTERS WERE CHAMBERMAIDS SHE COULDN'T EXACTLY REMEMBER WHICH
SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAINST HER EXPECTATION ALMOST PLACED IN THE POSITION OF JUSTIFYING HERSELF WHICH LED HER TO INTRODUCE THIS NOBLEMAN MORE CRUDELY THAN SHE HAD INTENDED HE HAS BEEN VERY KIND TO ME AND I LIKE HIM VERY MUCH
THE THEORY I HAVE JUST MENTIONED WAS PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH BUT IT BROUGHT HER LITTLE REST AND IF YOU HAD SEEN HER PACING ABOUT YOU WOULD HAVE SAID SHE HAD A BAD CONSCIENCE SHE WAS NOT PACIFIED WHEN AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR FINDING HERSELF IN VIEW OF THE HOUSE
I HAVEN'T MUCH TIME BUT I'VE A FLY AT THE DOOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT WAS NOT APPARENT WHETHER THE THANKS APPLIED TO HER HAVING REMINDED HIM OF HIS TRAIN OR TO THE MORE SENTIMENTAL REMARK GOOD BYE MISSUS OSMOND GOOD BYE
I'M VERY SURE OF THAT NOTHING CAN BE MORE HONOURABLE THAN FOR HIM TO LEAVE THE POOR CHILD ALONE SHE CARES FOR ANOTHER PERSON AND IT'S CRUEL TO ATTEMPT TO BRIBE HER BY MAGNIFICENT OFFERS TO GIVE HIM UP
BUT IF IT WAS AN AFFECTATION SHE WAS AT A LOSS TO SEE WHAT HER HUSBAND AFFECTED SHE COULD ONLY DIMLY PERCEIVE THAT HE HAD MORE TRADITIONS THAN SHE SUPPOSED IT HAD BECOME HER HABIT TO BE SO CAREFUL AS TO WHAT SHE SAID TO HIM THAT
YOU'LL BE VERY FAR AWAY SHE PRESENTLY WENT ON YES I SHALL BE FAR AWAY BUT IT WILL SCARCELY MATTER ISABEL EXPLAINED SINCE SO LONG AS YOU'RE HERE I CAN'T BE CALLED NEAR YOU
ISABEL COULD HAVE FANCIED SHE HAD SEEN HIM THE DAY BEFORE IT MUST HAVE BEEN WITH JUST THAT FACE AND STEP THAT HE HAD WALKED OUT OF MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DOOR AT THE CLOSE OF THEIR LAST INTERVIEW HE WAS DRESSED
WITH HIS HEAD INCLINED A LITTLE AT THE BASKET OF FLOWERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE AH YES HE SAID AT LAST I HAD THOUGHT OF THAT YOU MUST GO AND SEE HER YOU KNOW BUT NOT TOO OFTEN I DARE SAY YOU WONDER WHY I SENT HER TO THE GOOD SISTERS
MAKING HIS QUEER GRIM POINT AGAIN I'D SOONER HAVE BEEN SHOT THAN LET ANOTHER MAN SAY THOSE THINGS TO ME BUT HE WAS DIFFERENT HE SEEMED TO ME TO HAVE THE RIGHT IT WAS AFTER HE GOT HOME WHEN HE SAW HE WAS DYING AND WHEN I SAW IT TOO
WHEREUPON HE TOOK OUT HIS WATCH AND SAT DOWN UPON A BROKEN BLOCK IT'S VERY SOON TOLD SAID EDWARD ROSIER I'VE SOLD ALL MY BIBELOTS ISABEL GAVE INSTINCTIVELY AN EXCLAMATION OF HORROR
IT WAS NOT TOO SAD SINCE DEATH FOR HIM HAD HAD NO VIOLENCE HE HAD BEEN DYING SO LONG HE WAS SO READY EVERYTHING HAD BEEN SO EXPECTED AND PREPARED THERE WERE TEARS IN ISABEL'S EYES
AS I DID THE OTHER DAY IN ROME THAT WAS OF NO USE IT ONLY DISTRESSED YOU
MADAME MERLE WAS SITTING JUST AS ISABEL HAD LEFT HER LIKE A WOMAN SO ABSORBED IN THOUGHT
HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO HER IN A NEW AND VIOLENT LIGHT BUT THE SECONDARY EFFECT OF THE REVELATION WAS TO MAKE HER REACH OUT A HAND
OR FOR MORE PERSONAL REASONS IF HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF PERSONAL REASONS IT WAS VERY FORTUNATE THAT HE HAD THE COVER OF THE FORMER MOTIVE HE COULD MAKE THE MOST OF THAT ISABEL THOUGHT OF ALL THIS IT WAS NOT THAT HIS FACE WAS SAD
HER COMING ITSELF HAD NOT BEEN A DECISION ON THAT OCCASION SHE HAD SIMPLY STARTED OSMOND GAVE NO SOUND AND NOW EVIDENTLY WOULD GIVE NONE HE WOULD LEAVE IT ALL TO HER FROM PANSY SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THAT WAS VERY SIMPLE
SUCH AN ATTITUDE TO DAY COULD BELONG ONLY TO MISTER EDWARD ROSIER AND THIS GENTLEMAN PROVED IN FACT TO HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING THE QUESTION OF SPEAKING TO HER WHEN HE HAD ASSURED HIMSELF THAT SHE WAS UNACCOMPANIED HE DREW NEAR
BUT FELT LIKE SHE KNEW NOT WHAT
SINCE THE ENTRANCE TO THE PALACE WAS NOT THROUGH THE GARDEN IN WHICH STILLNESS AND PRIVACY ALWAYS REIGNED SHE WISHED RATHER TO FORESTALL HIS ARRIVAL BY A PROCESS OF CONJECTURE AND TO JUDGE BY THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE THIS ATTEMPT GAVE HER PLENTY TO DO
BUT SHE HAD PUT IT ON AGAIN TO RALPH'S INFINITE DISAPPOINTMENT HE HAD CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HER NATURAL FACE AND HE WISHED IMMENSELY TO LOOK INTO IT
WERE CONNECTED WITH THE BANK AND THERE WERE OTHERS WHOM SHE KNEW MISS STACKPOLE WAS AMONG THE FIRST WITH HONEST MISTER BANTLING BESIDE HER AND CASPAR GOODWOOD LIFTING HIS HEAD HIGHER THAN THE REST BOWING IT RATHER LESS
WHAT REMAINED WAS THE CLEVEREST WOMAN IN THE WORLD STANDING THERE WITHIN A FEW FEET OF HER AND KNOWING AS LITTLE WHAT TO THINK AS THE MEANEST ISABEL'S ONLY REVENGE WAS TO BE SILENT STILL
YOU'RE VERY PHILOSOPHIC SAID HER COUSIN AND THEN IN A MOMENT MAY I ENQUIRE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ISABEL STARED I THOUGHT YOU KNEW LORD WARBURTON TELLS ME HE WANTS OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD TO MARRY PANSY
YES I CAME VERY SUDDENLY MISSUS TOUCHETT TURNED AWAY AS IF SHE WERE LOOKING AT THE CONDITION OF THE GROUNDS WHICH INDEED WAS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE WHILE LORD WARBURTON HESITATED A LITTLE
AND IT WAS OF NO USE THAT WHEN CATCHING HERSELF IN THIS STATE OF MIND SHE CALLED HERSELF A FEEBLE SPIRIT A COWARD IT WAS NOT THAT SHE LOVED RALPH LESS BUT THAT ALMOST ANYTHING SEEMED PREFERABLE TO REPUDIATING THE MOST SERIOUS ACT
FOR THE BOTTOMLESS IDIOCY OF THE WORLD WE'VE NOTHING TO DO WITH ALL THAT WE'RE QUITE OUT OF IT WE LOOK AT THINGS AS THEY ARE YOU TOOK THE GREAT STEP IN COMING AWAY THE NEXT IS NOTHING IT'S THE NATURAL ONE I SWEAR AS I STAND HERE
AND OF THIS PORTION OF THE WILL LORD WARBURTON WAS APPOINTED EXECUTOR THE REST OF HIS PROPERTY WHICH WAS TO BE WITHDRAWN FROM THE BANK WAS DISPOSED OF IN VARIOUS BEQUESTS SEVERAL OF THEM TO THOSE COUSINS IN VERMONT
AND EUSTON SQUARE WAS A LONG WAY FROM PICCADILLY BUT ISABEL PERFORMED THE JOURNEY WITH A POSITIVE ENJOYMENT OF ITS DANGERS AND LOST HER WAY ALMOST ON PURPOSE IN ORDER TO GET MORE SENSATIONS SO THAT SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN AN OBLIGING POLICEMAN EASILY
SHE STOOD AND LOOKED AT IT AS IF IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO HER SHE WOULDN'T SIT DOWN ON IT NOW SHE FELT RATHER AFRAID OF IT SHE ONLY STOOD BEFORE IT
A SPARK OF TIMID PASSION WHICH TOUCHED ISABEL TO THE HEART AT THE SAME TIME A WAVE OF ENVY PASSED OVER HER SOUL AS SHE COMPARED THE TREMULOUS LONGING THE DEFINITE IDEAL
WHILE PANSY GUIDED HER UNDISCRIMINATING AUNT TO THE STEEP BRICK STAIRCASE AT THE FOOT OF WHICH THE CUSTODIAN UNLOCKS THE TALL WOODEN GATE THE GREAT ENCLOSURE WAS HALF IN SHADOW
SHE CAME VERY SOON TO WHAT SHE WISHED TO SPEAK OF I WANT YOU TO ANSWER ME A QUESTION IT'S ABOUT LORD WARBURTON I THINK I GUESS YOUR QUESTION RALPH ANSWERED FROM HIS ARM CHAIR OUT OF WHICH HIS THIN LEGS PROTRUDED AT GREATER LENGTH THAN EVER
SHE HATED TO HEAR HERSELF SAY IT SHE TRIED TO SAY IT AS JUDICIALLY AS POSSIBLE WHAT DOES HE DO TO YOU HENRIETTA ASKED FROWNING AS IF SHE WERE ENQUIRING INTO THE OPERATIONS OF A QUACK DOCTOR
BUT THEY WERE NOT TEARS THAT BLINDED SHE LOOKED THROUGH THEM AT THE BEAUTY OF THE DAY THE SPLENDOUR OF NATURE THE SWEETNESS OF THE OLD ENGLISH CHURCHYARD THE BOWED HEADS OF GOOD FRIENDS LORD WARBURTON WAS THERE AND A GROUP OF GENTLEMEN ALL UNKNOWN TO HER
HE BROUGHT HIS FATHER OVER TO IT AH MY DEAR THE SUM WAS LARGE ISABEL STOOD STARING
OUR ATTENTION IS ENGAGED AGAIN ON A CERTAIN DAY IN THE LATE SPRING TIME SHORTLY AFTER HER RETURN TO PALAZZO CRESCENTINI
ISABEL HAD A DIFFICULT TASK THE ONLY THING WAS TO PERFORM IT AS SIMPLY AS POSSIBLE SHE FELT BITTER AND ANGRY BUT SHE WARNED HERSELF AGAINST BETRAYING THIS HEAT SHE WAS AFRAID EVEN OF LOOKING TOO GRAVE OR AT LEAST TOO STERN SHE WAS AFRAID OF CAUSING ALARM
MADAME MERLE ADDED HAVE YOU REASON TO BELIEVE THAT HE'S REALLY AT HIS LAST I'VE NO INFORMATION BUT A TELEGRAM UNFORTUNATELY IT ONLY CONFIRMS A PROBABILITY
AND SPEND HALF AN HOUR IN A SMALL GREY CHURCH WHICH STOOD WITHIN AN EASY WALK IT WAS IN THE GREEN BURIAL PLACE OF THIS EDIFICE THAT MISSUS TOUCHETT CONSIGNED HER SON TO EARTH SHE STOOD HERSELF AT THE EDGE OF THE GRAVE
AND WAS ADMITTED BY THE PORTRESS OF THE CONVENT A GENIAL AND OBSEQUIOUS PERSON ISABEL HAD BEEN AT THIS INSTITUTION BEFORE SHE HAD COME WITH PANSY TO SEE THE SISTERS SHE KNEW THEY WERE GOOD WOMEN
