MINA HARKER'S JOURNAL TWENTY THREE SEPTEMBER JONATHAN IS BETTER AFTER A BAD NIGHT I AM SO GLAD THAT HE HAS PLENTY OF WORK TO DO FOR THAT KEEPS HIS MIND OFF THE TERRIBLE THINGS
THAT IS TRUE INDIRECTLY BUT NOT DIRECTLY HOW DO YOU MEAN PROFESSOR I ASKED I WAS A LITTLE INCLINED TO TAKE HIS SERIOUSNESS LIGHTLY FOR AFTER ALL
YOUR HUSBAND IS NOBLE NATURE AND YOU ARE NOBLE TOO FOR YOU TRUST AND TRUST CANNOT BE WHERE THERE IS MEAN NATURE AND YOUR HUSBAND TELL ME OF HIM IS HE QUITE WELL
BY THIS TIME MY LITTLE JOKE WAS OVER AND I WAS ALMOST ASHAMED SO I TOOK THE TYPEWRITTEN COPY FROM MY WORKBASKET AND HANDED IT TO HIM FORGIVE ME I SAID I COULD NOT HELP IT BUT
OR HAD HE SOME CAUSE FOR IT ALL I SUPPOSE I SHALL NEVER KNOW FOR I DARE NOT OPEN THE SUBJECT TO HIM AND YET THAT MAN WE SAW YESTERDAY HE SEEMED QUITE CERTAIN OF HIM POOR FELLOW
I HOPE TOO DOCTOR VAN HELSING WILL NOT BLAME ME I HAVE HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE AND ANXIETY OF LATE THAT I FEEL I CANNOT BEAR MORE JUST AT PRESENT I SUPPOSE A CRY DOES US ALL GOOD AT TIMES
BUT I HAVE SEEN YOUR TRUE SELF SINCE LAST NIGHT YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR HAND WILL YOU NOT AND LET US BE FRIENDS FOR ALL OUR LIVES WE SHOOK HANDS AND HE WAS SO EARNEST AND SO KIND THAT IT MADE ME QUITE CHOKY
I SUPPOSE NOW YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN CORPOREAL TRANSFERENCE NO NOR IN MATERIALISATION NO NOR IN ASTRAL BODIES NO
WELL HE SAID IT IS LIKE POOR LUCY'S AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT SIMPLY THAT THERE IS SOME CAUSE IN COMMON WHATEVER IT WAS THAT INJURED HER HAS INJURED THEM I DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND HIS ANSWER
VAN HELSING TO MISSUS HARKER TWENTY FOUR SEPTEMBER CONFIDENCE DEAR MADAM I PRAY YOU TO PARDON MY WRITING IN THAT I AM SO FAR FRIEND AS THAT I SENT TO YOU SAD NEWS OF MISS LUCY WESTENRA'S DEATH
AND REJECT THE THOUGHT READING LET ME TELL YOU MY FRIEND THAT THERE ARE THINGS DONE TO DAY IN ELECTRICAL SCIENCE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED UNHOLY BY THE VERY MEN WHO DISCOVERED ELECTRICITY
WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CRIED HE THREW HIMSELF WITH A DESPAIRING GESTURE INTO A CHAIR AND PLACED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE COVERING HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS AS HE SPOKE
HE HAD AN OBVIOUS MOTIVE FOR WISHING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A BARREN QUEEN AND HE WAS THEREFORE SUSPECTED OF HAVING PURPOSELY RECOMMENDED ONE THE SALE OF DUNKIRK WAS JUSTLY IMPUTED TO HIM
THAT HE WAS ABLE TO OVERPOWER AND CRUSH EVERYTHING THAT CROSSED HIS PATH TO MAKE HIMSELF MORE ABSOLUTE MASTER OF HIS COUNTRY THAN ANY OF HER LEGITIMATE KINGS HAD BEEN AND TO MAKE HIS COUNTRY MORE DREADED AND RESPECTED THAN SHE HAD BEEN DURING MANY GENERATIONS
WIDELY AS THEY DIFFERED IN SPIRIT FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE LONG PARLIAMENT THEY YET HE SAID IMITATED THAT PARLIAMENT IN MEDDLING WITH MATTERS WHICH LAY BEYOND THE SPHERE OF THE ESTATES OF THE REALM
OF HIS OWN PALACE IN NO LONG TIME IT BECAME MANIFEST THAT THOSE POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS ZEALOTS TO WHOM THIS DEED IS TO BE ASCRIBED HAD COMMITTED NOT ONLY A CRIME BUT AN ERROR
COMPLAINED THAT THE GOVERNMENT TREATED THE MOST SERIOUS MATTERS AS TRIFLES AND MADE TRIFLES ITS SERIOUS BUSINESS A KING MIGHT BE PARDONED FOR AMUSING HIS LEISURE WITH WINE WIT AND BEAUTY BUT IT WAS INTOLERABLE
WAS A TASK TOO HARD FOR THAT ADMINISTRATION
A REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL WAS CREATED THAT TRIBUNAL PRONOUNCED CHARLES A TYRANT A TRAITOR A MURDERER AND A PUBLIC ENEMY AND HIS HEAD WAS SEVERED FROM HIS SHOULDERS BEFORE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS IN FRONT OF THE BANQUETING HALL
HE HAD DURING THE THIRTEEN YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED GONE THROUGH A POLITICAL EDUCATION OF NO COMMON KIND HE HAD BEEN A CHIEF ACTOR IN A SUCCESSION OF REVOLUTIONS HE HAD BEEN LONG THE SOUL AND AT LAST THE HEAD OF A PARTY
HE WAS THE OSTENSIBLE HEAD OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND WAS THEREFORE HELD RESPONSIBLE EVEN FOR THOSE ACTS WHICH HE HAD STRONGLY BUT VAINLY OPPOSED IN COUNCIL HE WAS REGARDED BY THE PURITANS
AN ADDITION WAS MADE TO THE NUMBER OF THE MEMBERS FOR THE CAPITAL THE ELECTIVE FRANCHISE WAS PLACED ON SUCH A FOOTING THAT EVERY MAN OF SUBSTANCE WHETHER POSSESSED OF FREEHOLD ESTATES IN LAND OR NOT HAD A VOTE FOR THE COUNTY IN WHICH HE RESIDED
HAD THERE BEEN SO LITTLE RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION THE UNFORTUNATE ROMAN CATHOLICS INDEED WERE HELD TO BE SCARCELY WITHIN THE PALE OF CHRISTIAN CHARITY BUT THE CLERGY OF THE FALLEN ANGLICAN CHURCH
FOR THE WAR WITH HOLLAND HE WAS WITH LESS JUSTICE HELD ACCOUNTABLE HIS HOT TEMPER HIS ARROGANT DEPORTMENT THE INDELICATE EAGERNESS WITH WHICH HE GRASPED AT RICHES THE OSTENTATION WITH WHICH HE SQUANDERED THEM
PACIFIED AND REGULATED KINGDOMS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANGE INDEED IF HIS NOTIONS HAD BEEN STILL THE SAME AS IN THE DAYS WHEN HIS MIND WAS PRINCIPALLY OCCUPIED BY HIS FIELDS AND HIS RELIGION AND WHEN THE GREATEST EVENTS WHICH DIVERSIFIED THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE WERE A CATTLE FAIR
FOR GREAT TRACTS OF FORESTS STILL COVERED A LARGE PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
FOUND THAT HIS GUEST DESIRED TO FIND ONE GILES FLETCHER A MAKER OF BOWS I KNOW HIM WELL THE SMITH SAID THERE ARE MANY WHO DO A LARGER BUSINESS AND HOLD THEIR HEADS HIGHER BUT GILES FLETCHER IS WELL ESTEEMED AS A GOOD WORKMAN WHOSE WARES CAN BE DEPENDED UPON IT IS OFTEN SAID OF HIM
AND HIS LANDS LIKE THOSE OF SIR ROLAND HAVE BEEN SEIZED BY THE CROWN THE CHILD UPSTAIRS IS BY RIGHT HEIR TO BOTH ESTATES SEEING THAT HIS UNCLE DIED UNMARRIED
THAT WALTER SHOULD BE APPRENTICED TO HIM THAN HE HAD EXPECTED THE BOWYER INDEED WAS A QUIET MAN
MORE THAN ONCE SURLY MEN HAD ACCOSTED HIM AND HAD THREATENED TO KNOCK HIM ON THE HEAD IF THEY AGAIN FOUND HIM WANDERING THAT WAY BUT WALTER LAUGHED AT THEIR THREATS
URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD CEASE HE SAID AUTHORITATIVELY
BUT NONE WHO HAVE EVER BOUGHT HIS BOWS HAVE REGRETTED THE SILVER WHICH THEY COST MANY AND MANY A GROSS OF ARROWHEADS HAVE I SOLD HIM
THEY WILL DOUBTLESS BE CONFERRED UPON THOSE WHO HAVE AIDED THE YOUNG KING IN FREEING HIMSELF FROM HIS MOTHER'S DOMINATION FOR WHICH INDEED ALTHOUGH I LAMENT THAT LADY ALICE SHOULD HAVE SUFFERED SO SORELY IN THE DOING OF IT I BLAME HIM NOT AT ALL
I HAVE PASSED THEM THE WOMAN SAID BUT ALL SEEMED FULL OF ROISTERERS I AM WET AND WEARY AND MY STRENGTH IS NIGH SPENT I CAN PAY THEE GOOD FELLOW AND I PRAY YOU AS A CHRISTIAN TO LET ME COME IN AND SLEEP BEFORE YOUR FIRE FOR THE NIGHT
STAND YOU COWARDS RALLY ROUND YOUR LEADER AND IN HIS ENTHUSIASM THE YOUNG PRINCE URGED HIS HORSE FORWARD TO THE SCENE OF CONFLICT BUT THE ASSAILANTS WERE MASTERED
SHE FEEBLY MADE HER WAY INTO THE VILLAGE
HE SHOULD LONG TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF IN THE FIELD HE SAID NOTHING OF THIS HOWEVER BUT RENEWED HIS PROMISE TO SPEAK TO GILES FLETCHER
YOUNG AS HE IS TO BE ALREADY HIGHLY SKILLED IN ARMS MEN SAY THAT HE WILL BE A WISE KING AND A GALLANT CAPTAIN SUCH A ONE AS A BRAVE SOLDIER MIGHT BE PROUD TO FOLLOW
THOUGH HARDLY PRESSED ON ALL SIDES
THAT WALTER WONDERED WHAT BUSINESS THERE MIGHT BE SCARCELY KNOWING WHY HE DID SO WALTER THREW HIMSELF DOWN AMONG SOME LOW BRUSHWOOD AND WATCHED THE APPROACHING FIGURE WHEN HE CAME NEAR
WHETHER TO INFORM HIS MASTER OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE WAS HOWEVER BENT UPON HAVING AN ADVENTURE ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AND
OR HATE OTHERS FOUR THE MASTER SAID
HERODOTUS AESCHYLUS SOPHOCLES ARISTOPHANES
BEGIN BY PUTTING A LAYER OF THE PRINTS IN THE BOTTOM OF A STONE POT PRESS THE BUTTER DOWN CLOSE SO THAT NO CAVITIES FOR THE ADMISSION OF AIR MAY REMAIN THEN STREW MORE OF THE MIXTURE OVER IT PROCEED IN THIS MANNER UNTIL THE VESSEL IS FILLED
SHALL I TELL IT TO YOU DO ARABELLA DONN I'M LIVING HERE I MUST HAVE KNOWN IT IF I HAD OFTEN COME THIS WAY BUT I MOSTLY GO STRAIGHT ALONG THE HIGH ROAD MY FATHER IS A PIG BREEDER
ITS INTERIOR WAS THE SCENE OF MOST OF JUDE'S EDUCATION BY PRIVATE STUDY AS SOON AS THE HORSE HAD LEARNT THE ROAD AND THE HOUSES AT WHICH HE WAS TO PAUSE AWHILE THE BOY SEATED IN FRONT WOULD SLIP THE REINS OVER HIS ARM INGENIOUSLY FIX OPEN
MAY HAVE HAD LITTLE CHANCE OF BECOMING A SCHOLAR BY THESE ROUGH AND READY MEANS HE WAS IN THE WAY OF GETTING INTO THE GROOVE HE WISHED TO FOLLOW WHILE HE WAS BUSIED WITH THESE ANCIENT PAGES WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN THUMBED BY HANDS POSSIBLY IN THE GRAVE
AND A LOT OF THE GREEK TESTAMENT I WISH THERE WAS ONLY ONE DIALECT ALL THE SAME I HAVE DONE SOME MATHEMATICS INCLUDING THE FIRST SIX AND THE ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH BOOKS OF EUCLID AND ALGEBRA AS FAR AS SIMPLE EQUATIONS I KNOW SOMETHING OF THE FATHERS
HE STOPPED THE HORSE ALIGHTED AND GLANCING ROUND TO SEE THAT NOBODY WAS IN SIGHT KNELT DOWN ON THE ROADSIDE BANK WITH OPEN BOOK HE TURNED FIRST TO THE SHINY GODDESS WHO SEEMED TO LOOK SO SOFTLY AND CRITICALLY AT HIS DOINGS
WHEN THE CREAM WILL BE THICK AND RICH AND CHURNS EASIER IF THE WEATHER IS VERY COLD AND THE CREAM HAS BEEN CHILLED HAVE A LARGE POT OF WATER OVER THE FIRE SET IN THE BUCKET WHEN IT IS NEAR BOILING HEAT AND KEEP STIRRING TILL IT IS MILK WARM HAVE THE CHURN SCALDED AND PUT IT IN
PERSONS WITH WEAK NERVES SHOULD NEVER DRINK STRONG TEA AND COFFEE I HAVE KNOWN INSTANCES OF PERSONS BEING AFFLICTED WITH VIOLENT ATTACKS OF NERVOUS HEAD ACHE
ULTIMATELY HE DECIDED THAT IN HIS SHEER LOVE OF READING HE HAD TAKEN UP A WRONG EMOTION FOR A CHRISTIAN YOUNG MAN HE HAD DABBLED IN CLARKE'S HOMER BUT HAD NEVER YET WORKED MUCH AT THE NEW TESTAMENT IN THE GREEK THOUGH HE POSSESSED A COPY
MEDIAEVAL ART IN ANY MATERIAL WAS A TRADE FOR WHICH HE HAD RATHER A FANCY HE COULD NOT GO FAR WRONG IN FOLLOWING HIS UNCLE'S FOOTSTEPS AND ENGAGING HIMSELF AWHILE WITH THE CARCASES THAT CONTAINED THE SCHOLAR SOULS
CH'ANG IS PASSIONATE HOW CAN HE BE FIRM ELEVEN TZU KUNG SAID
GETTING UP IN A GREAT PET BUT CLOVER WHO WAS A BORN PEACEMAKER CAUGHT HOLD OF HIS ARM
EVEN BABY VOTES AND STAR EYED CHILDREN IN WHOSE INNOCENT FACES KINDLES THE GLADNESS WHICH WAS ONCE OUR OWN CROWD ROUND OUR KNEES WITH SWEET AND COAXING VOICES ASKING FOR STORIES OF THAT OLD TIME HOME
IT WAS ONLY A LOW ROOF SET OVER A HOLE IN THE GROUND AND AS IT STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDE YARD IT ALWAYS SEEMED TO THE CHILDREN THAT THE SHORTEST ROAD TO EVERY PLACE WAS UP ONE OF ITS SLOPES AND DOWN THE OTHER
AND BATTER PUDDINGS NOT BOILED ONES YOU KNOW BUT LITTLE BAKED ONES WITH BROWN SHINY TOPS AND A GREAT DEAL OF PUDDING SAUCE TO EAT ON THEM
WHAT SHE DID TO MAKE HERSELF GROW SO NOBODY COULD TELL BUT THERE SHE WAS UP ABOVE PAPA'S EAR AND HALF A HEAD TALLER THAN POOR AUNT IZZIE WHENEVER SHE STOPPED TO THINK ABOUT HER HEIGHT SHE BECAME VERY AWKWARD
SHE WAS A FAIR SWEET DUMPLING OF A GIRL WITH THICK PIG TAILS OF LIGHT BROWN HAIR AND SHORT SIGHTED BLUE EYES WHICH SEEMED TO HOLD TEARS JUST READY TO FALL FROM UNDER THE BLUE REALLY CLOVER WAS THE JOLLIEST LITTLE THING IN THE WORLD
WHICH WERE HER GREATEST GRIEVANCE HER EYES WERE BRIGHT AND QUICK AS A BIRD'S SHE WOULD PEEP AND PEER AND FOLLOW AND WATCH TILL AT LAST IN SOME ODD UNLIKELY PLACE THE CROTCH OF A TREE
THE LITTLE ONES KEPT HOPING SHE MIGHT RETURN AUNT IZZIE WAS A SMALL WOMAN SHARP FACED AND THIN RATHER OLD LOOKING AND VERY NEAT AND PARTICULAR ABOUT EVERYTHING SHE MEANT TO BE KIND TO THE CHILDREN BUT THEY PUZZLED HER MUCH
WHICH ALWAYS LOOKED READY TO LAUGH THESE TWO WERE GREAT FRIENDS THOUGH DORRY SEEMED LIKE A GIRL WHO HAD GOT INTO BOY'S CLOTHES BY MISTAKE AND JOHNNIE LIKE A BOY WHO IN A FIT OF FUN HAD BORROWED HIS SISTER'S FROCK
HE'S CAPTAIN TOO NAMED DAVIES
IT SHALL BE SOMETHING AND WHEN AUNT IZZIE SEES IT AND READS ABOUT ME IN THE NEWSPAPERS SHE WILL SAY THE DEAR CHILD
AND A BLISSFUL STICKINESS PERVADED THE PARTY
AT THIS TIME SHE LOOKED AT THEM WITH PLEASED EYES THEY WERE ALL SO SPICK AND SPAN WITH SUCH NICELY BRUSHED JACKETS AND SUCH NEATLY COMBED HAIR BUT THE MOMENT THE BELL RANG HER COMFORT WAS OVER FROM THAT TIME ON
AND NEVER RUN AWAY AND HIDE AND THERE WON'T BE ANY POST OFFICES OR ANYTHING DISAGREEABLE WHAT'LL YOU BE JOHNNIE ASKED CLOVER ANXIOUS TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT FOR ELSIE'S VOICE WAS GROWING PLAINTIVE
THESE SAME ACTIVE BRAINS GOT HER INTO PERPETUAL SCRAPES SHE WAS FOND OF BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR
ITS OWNER DECIDED TO TEAR IT DOWN AND IN DOING SO HE STUMBLED UPON A STARTLING DISCOVERY HE FOUND A DUMMY WINDOW THAT GENERATIONS BEFORE HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN BUILT OVER AND CONCEALED
LIKE UNTO THAT WHICH GROWETH IN BRESIL AND LATER ON IN THE ACCOUNT OF HIS SECOND VOYAGE HE REPEATS THE REFERENCE TO BRAZIL THEN GOODLY AND LARGE FIELDS
OUT OF THIS BACKGROUND THEN OF UNCERTAINTY AND CONJECTURE EMERGES IN FIFTEEN THIRTY FOUR JACQUES CARTIER A
NEFFER NEFFER
AND SMILING ACCORDING TO CUSTOM ENTERED THE CABARET OF THE PARPAILLOT AS THE FOUR FRIENDS WERE SITTING DOWN TO BREAKFAST SAYING AS HAD BEEN AGREED UPON
THAT'S ALL VERY WELL REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN BUT I AM TIRED OF FEARING WHEN I OPEN A FRESH BOTTLE THAT THE WINE MAY COME FROM THE CELLAR OF MILADY
IN THE TICKLISH AFFAIR OF BOULOGNE THESE FOUR VIRTUES DISPUTED THE PRIZE FOR A LENGTH OF TIME AND GAVE BIRTH TO MAGNIFICENT SPEECHES WHICH WE DO NOT REPEAT HERE FOR FEAR THEY SHOULD BE DEEMED TOO LONG
IN A BAPTISMAL REGISTER OF SAINT MALO IS RECORDED THE CHRISTENING IN FIFTEEN TWENTY EIGHT OF A CERTAIN CATHERINE OF BREZIL TO WHOM CARTIER'S WIFE STOOD GODMOTHER WE MAY
A FAMILY AFFAIR WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE INVESTIGATION OF THE CARDINAL A FAMILY AFFAIR CONCERNED NOBODY PEOPLE MIGHT EMPLOY THEMSELVES IN A FAMILY AFFAIR BEFORE ALL THE WORLD
DID NOT ALLOW THEM TO SLEEP VERY QUIETLY
IT WAS ONLY THIS I HAD A DREAM AND I RELATED IT TO HER YEZ YEZ SAID THE SWISS IT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH TO DELL A DREAM BUT I NEFFER DREAM
D'ARTAGNAN PASSED THE DAY IN EXHIBITING HIS MUSKETEER'S UNIFORM IN EVERY STREET OF THE CAMP IN THE EVENING AT THE APPOINTED HOUR THE FOUR FRIENDS MET THERE ONLY REMAINED THREE THINGS TO DECIDE
CONFIDING IN THE ADDRESS OF BAZIN MADE A POMPOUS EULOGIUM ON HIS CANDIDATE FINALLY D'ARTAGNAN HAD ENTIRE FAITH IN THE BRAVERY OF PLANCHET AND REMINDED THEM OF THE MANNER IN WHICH HE HAD CONDUCTED HIMSELF
REPUDIATED BY HER HUSBAND SAID ATHOS BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN BRANDED CONTINUED D'ARTAGNAN BAH CRIED PORTHOS IMPOSSIBLE WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT SHE WANTED TO HAVE HER BROTHER IN LAW KILLED YES
BUT THE LAKE YOUR HIGHNESS SAID THE CHAMBERLAIN WHO ROUSED BY THE NOISE CAME IN IN HIS NIGHTCAP GO AND DROWN YOURSELF IN IT SHE SAID THIS WAS THE LAST RUDENESS OF WHICH THE PRINCESS WAS EVER GUILTY
AND SHONE FULL ON THE FACE OF THE DYING PRINCE THE WATER WAS UP TO HIS NECK WILL YOU KISS ME PRINCESS SAID HE FEEBLY THE NONCHALANCE WAS ALL GONE NOW
SO HE GAVE HER A STRONG LIFT OUT OF THE WATER TO LAY HER ON THE BANK BUT HER GRAVITATION CEASING THE MOMENT SHE LEFT THE WATER AWAY SHE WENT UP INTO THE AIR SCOLDING AND SCREAMING
SUDDENLY HE PAUSED AND LISTENED STRANGE SOUNDS CAME ACROSS THE WATER IT WAS IN FACT THE PRINCESS LAUGHING NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD IN HER LAUGH AS I HAVE ALREADY HINTED
IN A FEW MINUTES THE PRINCE APPEARED THE PRINCESS RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE BUT DID NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM HERE I AM SAID THE PRINCE PUT ME IN
YOU MUST HAVE A VAST AND MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID CANDIDE TO THE TURK I HAVE ONLY TWENTY ACRES REPLIED THE OLD MAN I AND MY CHILDREN CULTIVATE THEM OUR LABOUR PRESERVES US FROM THREE GREAT EVILS WEARINESS VICE AND WANT
SO PERFECTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAD SHE BEEN IN THE WATER THAT EVEN YET THE PRINCE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE HIS EYES WHEN HE SAW HER ASCEND SLOWLY GRASP THE BALCONY AND DISAPPEAR THROUGH THE WINDOW
MASTER SAID HE WE COME TO BEG YOU TO TELL WHY SO STRANGE AN ANIMAL AS MAN WAS MADE WITH WHAT MEDDLEST THOU SAID THE DERVISH IS IT THY BUSINESS
ANSWERED THE PRINCESS COME THEN SAID THE PRINCE THE CONDITION OF HER DRESS INCREASING HER USUAL DIFFICULTY IN WALKING COMPELLED HER TO CLING TO HIM AND HE COULD HARDLY PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT IN A DELIGHTFUL DREAM
ATHALIAH BY JEHOIADA THE KINGS JEHOIAKIM JECONIAH AND ZEDEKIAH WERE LED INTO CAPTIVITY
ONE DAY HE LOST SIGHT OF HIS RETINUE IN A GREAT FOREST THESE FORESTS ARE VERY USEFUL IN DELIVERING PRINCES FROM THEIR COURTIERS LIKE A SIEVE THAT KEEPS BACK THE BRAN THEN THE PRINCES GET AWAY TO FOLLOW THEIR FORTUNES
IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN PUT INTO THE INQUISITION IF YOU HAD NOT WALKED OVER AMERICA IF YOU HAD NOT STABBED THE BARON IF YOU HAD NOT LOST ALL YOUR SHEEP FROM THE FINE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE EATING PRESERVED CITRONS AND PISTACHIO NUTS
BUT HAD IN THE COURSE OF A HUNDRED YEARS GROWN INTO THE GRIMMEST LARGEST MOST GROTESQUE TREES I HAVE EVER SEEN OF THE KIND I HAD ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE AFRAID OF THEM EVEN IN THE DAYTIME BUT THEY DID ME NO HURT
INDEED SAID I I SEE CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT NEITHER IS INDEPENDENCE TO BE FOUND IN WEALTH NOR POWER IN SOVEREIGNTY NOR REVERENCE IN DIGNITIES NOR FAME IN GLORY NOR TRUE JOY IN PLEASURES
LIKE PHOSPHORESCENT SPARKS IN THE SEA FOAM
THE AWFUL VAULT OF HEAVEN OVER MY HEAD AND THOSE SHADOWY RICKS AROUND ME IT WAS A RELIEF TO LAY MY HAND ON ONE OF THEM AND FEEL THAT IT WAS SOLID I HALF GROPED MY WAY THROUGH THEM
HE WOULD NOT BE SUPREME OF ALL THINGS FOR THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE MORE EXCELLENT POSSESSED OF PERFECT GOOD WHICH WOULD SEEM TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE IN PRIORITY AND DIGNITY
AND HAVING NO FACES YET BUT BEING A SORT OF CELESTIAL TADPOLES INDICATED BY THEIR MOTIONS ALONE THAT THEY TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE QUESTIONS AGITATING THEIR PARENTS SOME OF THEM KEPT DARTING UP AND DOWN THE LADDER OF RAYS
BUT DEEP SET WITHIN THY INMOST BEING THE FORM OF PERFECT GOOD FROM ENVY FREE AND THOU DIDST MOULD THE WHOLE TO THAT SUPERNAL PATTERN BEAUTEOUS THE WORLD IN THEE THUS IMAGED
MY HEART SANK TOTALLY WITHIN ME I COULD BEAR NO MORE I FELL DOWN ON THE BED WEEPING BITTERLY AND WEPT MYSELF ASLEEP
WE MUST INVOKE THE FATHER OF ALL THINGS SAID I FOR WITHOUT THIS NO ENTERPRISE SETS OUT FROM A RIGHT BEGINNING
CLEARLY CANNOT BE SEVERALLY EACH WHAT THE OTHER IS WHEREFORE NEITHER OF THE TWO CAN BE PERFECT SINCE TO EITHER THE OTHER IS WANTING
TO ALL THAT MOVES THE SOURCE OF MOVEMENT FIXED THYSELF AND MOVELESS THEE NO CAUSE IMPELLED EXTRINSIC THIS PROPORTIONED FRAME TO SHAPE FROM SHAPELESS MATTER
IT IS UTTERLY INCONCEIVABLE HOW THAT SO CALLED IM PERFECTION SHOULD COME INTO EXISTENCE NATURE DOES NOT MAKE A BEGINNING WITH THINGS MUTILATED AND IMPERFECT
CANNOT BE IDENTICAL THEREFORE THAT WHICH OF ITS OWN NATURE IS DISTINCT FROM THE HIGHEST GOOD IS NOT ITSELF THE HIGHEST GOOD AN IMPIOUS THOUGHT OF HIM THAN WHOM TIS PLAIN NOTHING CAN BE MORE EXCELLENT
TO SO UNHAPPY A BEGINNING BE COMFORTED AND FORGIVE ME HEAVEN BLESS YOU AS HE WAS DRAWN AWAY HIS WIFE RELEASED HIM AND STOOD LOOKING AFTER HIM WITH HER HANDS TOUCHING ONE ANOTHER IN THE ATTITUDE OF PRAYER
WHEN HE HAD GONE OUT INTO THE NEXT ROOM HE TURNED SUDDENLY ON MISTER LORRY AND HER FATHER WHO WERE FOLLOWING AND SAID TO THE LATTER YOU HAD GREAT INFLUENCE BUT YESTERDAY DOCTOR MANETTE LET IT AT LEAST BE TRIED
OR ALL OF THESE MEN WERE DISPOSED TO SPARE HIM WHICH IS A LARGE SUPPOSITION FOR WHAT IS HIS LIFE OR ANY MAN'S TO THEM I DOUBT IF THEY DURST SPARE HIM AFTER THE DEMONSTRATION IN THE COURT AND SO DO I I HEARD THE FALL OF THE AXE IN THAT SOUND
IT IS SO ASSENTED DEFARGE AGAIN I COMMUNICATE TO HIM THAT SECRET I SMITE THIS BOSOM WITH THESE TWO HANDS AS I SMITE IT NOW AND I TELL HIM DEFARGE I WAS BROUGHT UP AMONG THE FISHERMEN OF THE SEA SHORE
THEN ISSUING FROM THE OBSCURE CORNER FROM WHICH HE HAD NEVER MOVED SYDNEY CARTON CAME AND TOOK HER UP ONLY HER FATHER AND MISTER LORRY WERE WITH HER HIS ARM TREMBLED AS IT RAISED HER AND SUPPORTED HER HEAD YET
HAVING ASCERTAINED ITS SITUATION CARTON CAME OUT OF THOSE CLOSER STREETS AGAIN AND DINED AT A PLACE OF REFRESHMENT AND FELL SOUND ASLEEP AFTER DINNER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY YEARS HE HAD NO STRONG DRINK
AND CARRIED HER UP THE STAIRCASE TO THEIR ROOMS THERE HE LAID HER DOWN ON A COUCH WHERE HER CHILD AND MISS PROSS WEPT OVER HER DON'T RECALL HER TO HERSELF HE SAID SOFTLY TO THE LATTER SHE IS BETTER SO DON'T REVIVE HER TO CONSCIOUSNESS
IT IS EASY TO FORESEE THAT THE PRETENCE WILL BE THE COMMON ONE A PRISON PLOT AND THAT IT WILL INVOLVE HER LIFE AND PERHAPS HER CHILD'S AND PERHAPS HER FATHER'S FOR BOTH HAVE BEEN SEEN WITH HER AT THAT PLACE DON'T LOOK SO HORRIFIED YOU WILL SAVE THEM ALL
TAKE A BUCKET OF ICE AND POUND IT FINE MIX WITH IT TWO QUARTS OF SALT PUT YOUR CREAM IN A FREEZER COVER IT CLOSE AND IMMERSE IT IN THE BUCKET DRAW THE ICE ROUND IT SO AS TO TOUCH EVERY PART AFTER IT HAS BEEN IN A FEW MINUTES PUT IN A SPOON AND STIR IT FROM THE EDGE TO THE CENTRE
AND HE TURNED HIS FACE TOWARDS SAINT ANTOINE DEFARGE HAD DESCRIBED HIMSELF THAT DAY AS THE KEEPER OF A WINE SHOP IN THE SAINT ANTOINE SUBURB IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR ONE WHO KNEW THE CITY WELL TO FIND HIS HOUSE WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTION
SEASON IT WITH A FEW DROPS OF ESSENCE OF LEMON OR SYRUP OF LEMON PEEL AND POWDERED WHITE SUGAR AND IF YOU CHOOSE A SPOONFUL OF PRESERVE SYRUP AND JUST AS YOU SEND IT TO TABLE
PROMISE ME SOLEMNLY THAT NOTHING WILL INFLUENCE YOU TO ALTER THE COURSE ON WHICH WE NOW STAND PLEDGED TO ONE ANOTHER NOTHING CARTON REMEMBER THESE WORDS TO MORROW CHANGE THE COURSE OR DELAY IN IT FOR ANY REASON AND NO LIFE
IF YE SEE THE LAIRD TELL HIM WHAT YE HEAR TELL HIM THIS MAKES THE TWELVE HUNNER AND NINETEEN TIME THAT JENNET CLOUSTON HAS CALLED DOWN THE CURSE ON HIM AND HIS HOUSE BYRE AND STABLE MAN GUEST AND MASTER WIFE MISS OR BAIRN
PROMPTLY AFTERWARDS FRESH SOUNDS OF ASTONISHMENT AROSE THE WINDOW OF THE CAPTAIN'S ROOM WAS THROWN OPEN WITH A SLAM AND A JINGLE OF BROKEN GLASS AND A MAN LEANED OUT INTO THE MOONLIGHT HEAD AND SHOULDERS AND ADDRESSED THE BLIND BEGGAR ON THE ROAD BELOW HIM
RELICS OF THE DAYS WHEN THE COUNTRYMEN OF JULIUS CAESAR HAD SETTLED THERE WHERE HAVE THEY NOT SETTLED I FOR ONE WOULD HARDLY BE ASTONISHED IF RELICS OF THE ANCIENT ROMANS SHOULD SOMEDAY BE FOUND DEEP UNDER THE GRASS GROWING AROUND THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT
BUT THE BLIND MAN SWORE AT THEM AGAIN FOR THEIR DELAY SEARCH HIM SOME OF YOU SHIRKING LUBBERS AND THE REST OF YOU ALOFT AND GET THE CHEST HE CRIED I COULD HEAR THEIR FEET RATTLING UP OUR OLD STAIRS SO THAT THE HOUSE MUST HAVE SHOOK WITH IT
AND THE MEN CAME OUT AGAIN ONE AFTER ANOTHER ON THE ROAD AND DECLARED THAT WE WERE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
BUT WHEN I HAD COME SO FAR A WAY ALREADY MERE SHAME WOULD NOT SUFFER ME TO DESIST TILL I HAD PUT THE MATTER TO THE TOUCH OF PROOF I WAS BOUND OUT OF MERE SELF RESPECT TO CARRY IT THROUGH AND LITTLE AS I LIKED THE SOUND OF WHAT I HEARD
AND WE WALKED BACK TO THE HAMLET WHERE THE HORSES WERE
AND CATS IBEXES AND OTHER CREATURES THEY SAW A MASSIVE GOLD ARMLET THAT HAD BEEN WORN BY AN EGYPTIAN KING AT A TIME WHEN SOME OF THESE SAME MUMMIES PERHAPS WERE NIMBLY TREADING THE STREETS OF THEBES
FINE BROAD PROMENADES SHADED BY NOBLE TREES BORDER THE CANALS AND ADD TO THE RETIRED APPEARANCE OF THE HOUSES BEHIND HEIGHTENING THE EFFECT OF SCHOLASTIC SECLUSION THAT SEEMS TO PERVADE THE PLACE
SEPARATING IN EVERY DIRECTION ONE SEAWARD ALONG THE COVE ONE SLANT ACROSS THE HILL AND SO ON SO THAT IN HALF A MINUTE NOT A SIGN OF THEM REMAINED BUT PEW
SCATTER LADS AND FIND EM SURE ENOUGH THEY LEFT THEIR GLIM HERE SAID THE FELLOW FROM THE WINDOW SCATTER AND FIND EM ROUT THE HOUSE OUT REITERATED PEW STRIKING WITH HIS STICK UPON THE ROAD
IN THE MEANTIME THE SUPERVISOR RODE ON AS FAST AS HE COULD TO KITT'S HOLE BUT HIS MEN HAD TO DISMOUNT AND GROPE DOWN THE DINGLE LEADING AND SOMETIMES SUPPORTING THEIR HORSES AND IN CONTINUAL FEAR OF AMBUSHES
THAN THEY WERE IN THE FACT OF ITS BEING A TRIPTYCH THAT IS PAINTED ON THREE DIVISIONS THE TWO OUTER ONES SWUNG ON HINGES SO AS TO CLOSE WHEN REQUIRED OVER THE MAIN PORTION
FOR IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHAT ANY OLD HORSE IS THINKING OH DEAR SAID DIAMOND WHEN HE HAD DONE I'M SO TIRED AND HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN AT FULL LENGTH ON OLD DIAMOND'S BACK BY THIS TIME ALL THE MEN IN THE STABLE WERE GATHERED ABOUT THE TWO DIAMONDS AND ALL MUCH AMUSED
AND SAID THE BELL SOUNDED LIKE THE VOICE OF A MOTHER TO A GOOD DEAR CHILD AND THAT NO MELODY WAS SWEETER THAN THE TONES OF THE BELL THE KING OF THE COUNTRY WAS ALSO OBSERVANT OF IT AND VOWED THAT HE WHO COULD DISCOVER WHENCE THE SOUNDS PROCEEDED
BUT A HELPLESS QUADRUPED HAS NOT THOUGH IF A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF THESE BATS ATTACKED A MAN AT THE SAME TIME HE WOULD HAVE SMALL CHANCE TO ESCAPE ALIVE THEIR BITES TOO MAY BE POISONOUS FOR ALL I KNOW
AND WOOD AND SEA
YOU SEE THEY'VE BEEN USED TO SUCH GRAND THINGS AND FOR THEM TO COME DOWN TO A LITTLE POKY HOUSE LIKE THAT IT BREAKS MY HEART TO THINK OF IT I DON'T KNOW SAID DIAMOND THOUGHTFULLY WHETHER MISSUS COLEMAN HAD BELLS ON HER TOES
ONE DAY WHICH WAS NEITHER WASHING DAY NOR CLEANING DAY NOR MARKETING DAY NOR SATURDAY NOR MONDAY UPON WHICH CONSEQUENTLY DIAMOND COULD BE SPARED FROM THE BABY HIS FATHER TOOK HIM ON HIS OWN CAB
A BOY IN WOODEN SHOES AND WITH SO SHORT A JACKET THAT ONE COULD SEE WHAT LONG WRISTS HE HAD BOTH KNEW EACH OTHER THE BOY WAS THAT ONE AMONG THE CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT COME BECAUSE HE HAD TO GO HOME AND RETURN HIS JACKET AND BOOTS TO THE INNKEEPER'S SON
THEY WERE EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE SOME ALMOST AS BIG AS HAWKS AND WERE OF THE SUB FAMILY DESMODIDAE THE SCIENTIST SAID THIS IS A TRUE BLOOD SUCKING BAT WENT ON THE PROFESSOR THIS AND HE POINTED TO THE NOSE LEAVES IS THE SUCKING APPARATUS
THEY MAY THERE IS NO TELLING BLESS MY SPEEDOMETER CRIED MISTER DAMON IF THOSE BEASTS OR BIRDS WHATEVER THEY ARE COME BACK I'LL GO AND HIDE IN THE RIVER AND TAKE MY CHANCES WITH THE ALLIGATORS
SO THEY COULD BE CARRIED IN THE UPPER COAT POCKET SHOWING A GLEAM OF LIGHT AND LEAVING THE HANDS FREE FOR USE OUT OF THE TENTS RUSHED THE YOUNG MEN TO FIND PROFESSOR BUMPER AND MISTER DAMON BEFORE THEM THE TWO MEN HAD CLUBS AND WERE STRIKING ABOUT IN THE HALF DARKNESS
HE IS THE SON OF A KING BUT ON HE WENT WITHOUT BEING DISHEARTENED DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THE WOOD WHERE THE MOST WONDERFUL FLOWERS WERE GROWING THERE STOOD WHITE LILIES WITH BLOOD RED STAMINA
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD GOT A CAB WELL YOU SEE MA'AM I HAD A CHANCE OF BUYING THE OLD HORSE AND I COULDN'T RESIST HIM
IT'S CHANGED TIMES FOR BOTH OF US JOSEPH AND IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN WE CAN HAVE A CAB EVEN
I DON'T KNOW BUT JACINTO IS YELLING SOMETHING ABOUT VAMPIRES VAMPIRES
DRESSED IN THE FINEST WHITE GAUZE MADE OF A MILLION LITTLE FLAKES LIKE STARS SHE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
AND IF HIS GRANDMOTHER TOLD THEM STORIES HE ALWAYS INTERRUPTED HER BESIDES IF HE COULD MANAGE IT HE WOULD GET BEHIND HER
AND HER HAIR CURLED AND SHONE WITH A LOVELY GOLDEN COLOR AROUND THAT SWEET LITTLE FACE WHICH WAS SO ROUND AND SO LIKE A ROSE I HAVE OFTEN LONGED FOR SUCH A DEAR LITTLE GIRL SAID THE OLD WOMAN
THERE WAS AN END OF THIS PLEASURE THE WINDOWS WERE OFTEN FROZEN OVER BUT THEN THEY HEATED COPPER FARTHINGS ON THE STOVE AND LAID THE HOT FARTHING ON THE WINDOWPANE AND THEN THEY HAD A CAPITAL PEEP HOLE QUITE NICELY ROUNDED
MY SLEDGE DO NOT FORGET MY SLEDGE IT WAS THE FIRST THING HE THOUGHT OF IT WAS THERE TIED TO ONE OF THE WHITE CHICKENS WHO FLEW ALONG WITH IT ON HIS BACK BEHIND THE LARGE SLEDGE
SHE WAS TALL AND OF SLENDER FIGURE
I SAID THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE IT WHICH ALICE DID NOT VENTURE TO DENY WHO DID YOU PASS ON THE ROAD THE KING WENT ON HOLDING OUT HIS HAND TO THE MESSENGER FOR SOME MORE HAY
IN THE LARGE HUGE EMPTY SPACE ABOVE HIM AND ON SHE FLEW WITH HIM FLEW HIGH OVER THE BLACK CLOUDS WHILE THE STORM MOANED AND WHISTLED AS THOUGH IT WERE SINGING SOME OLD TUNE
THE OLD WOMAN HAD FORGOTTEN TO TAKE IT FROM HER HAT WHEN SHE MADE THE OTHERS VANISH IN THE EARTH BUT SO IT IS WHEN ONE'S THOUGHTS ARE NOT COLLECTED WHAT
SO SHE CLAMBERED INTO A BOAT WHICH LAY AMONG THE RUSHES WENT TO THE FARTHEST END AND THREW OUT THE SHOES BUT THE BOAT WAS NOT FASTENED AND THE MOTION WHICH SHE OCCASIONED MADE IT DRIFT FROM THE SHORE SHE OBSERVED THIS AND HASTENED TO GET BACK
THE BOXES WERE VERY HIGH AND THE CHILDREN KNEW THAT THEY MUST NOT CREEP OVER THEM SO THEY OFTEN OBTAINED PERMISSION TO GET OUT OF THE WINDOWS TO EACH OTHER AND TO SIT ON THEIR LITTLE STOOLS AMONG THE ROSES WHERE THEY COULD PLAY DELIGHTFULLY
SHE'S A DEAR GOOD CREATURE HE REPEATED SOFTLY TO HIMSELF
PEEPING INTO THE BAG HAY THEN THE KING MURMURED IN A FAINT WHISPER ALICE WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT IT REVIVED HIM A GOOD DEAL THERE'S NOTHING LIKE EATING HAY WHEN YOU'RE FAINT
EVERY TIME HE WAS GOING TO UNTIE HIS SLEDGE THE PERSON NODDED TO HIM AND THEN KAY SAT QUIET AND SO ON THEY WENT TILL THEY CAME OUTSIDE THE GATES OF THE TOWN THEN THE SNOW BEGAN TO FALL SO THICKLY
THE TENDRILS OF THE PEAS HUNG DOWN OVER THE BOXES AND THE ROSE TREES SHOT UP LONG BRANCHES TWINED ROUND THE WINDOWS AND THEN BENT TOWARDS EACH OTHER IT WAS ALMOST LIKE A TRIUMPHANT ARCH OF FOLIAGE AND FLOWERS
AND ONE THE LARGEST OF ALL REMAINED LYING ON THE EDGE OF A FLOWER POT THE FLAKE OF SNOW GREW LARGER AND LARGER
FOR PERHAPS IF I DID NOT KNOW HER MYSELF I SHOULD PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND BELIEVE THE SAME AS YOU DO BUT THANK GOD I DO KNOW HER AND I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY THE NAME OF A MAN IF I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID AGAINST HER
HERE YOU HAVE DONE VERY WELL FOR ME NO NEVER MIND THE CHANGE COFFEE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE SHOULD FETCH A FANCY PRICE GOOD BYE THE TRAIN MOVED ON AND THE PORTER STOOD LOOKING AFTER IT WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES
OVER THE FIRST HALF CROWN HE HAD SAID TO HIMSELF MILK AND NEW LAID EGGS NOW AS HE POCKETED THE SECOND HE ADDED THE OTHER TWO THINGS MENTIONED BY THE PARISH DOCTOR SOUP AND JELLY AND HIS HEART GLOWED
AND LET ME ALONE HEREAFTER IN FACT WE MUST BE STRANGERS FOR THE FUTURE I WILL THEN BE YOUR FRIEND OR BROTHER OR ANYTHING YOU WISH IF YOU WILL ONLY LET ME CONTINUE TO SEE YOU BUT TELL ME WHY I CANNOT BE ANYTHING MORE
HE RAN TO PERFORM MY BIDDING AND QUICKLY RETURNED WITH HIS MOTHER HOW LOVELY SHE LOOKED WITH HER DARK RINGLETS STREAMING IN THE LIGHT SUMMER BREEZE HER FAIR CHEEK SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND HER COUNTENANCE RADIANT WITH SMILES
AND MY MOTHER MADE THE SAME DECLARATION THOUGH NOT I FEAR WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF REAL UNWAVERING INCREDULITY IT SEEMED TO DWELL CONTINUALLY ON HER MIND AND SHE KEPT IRRITATING ME FROM TIME TO TIME BY SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS
IF YOU STAND TILL MORNING NOW THEN SAID I UNCLOSING MY HAND BUT STILL STANDING BEFORE HIM ASK ME SOME OTHER TIME WHEN YOU CAN SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN RETURNED HE AND HE MADE AN EFFORT TO PASS ME AGAIN
I WILL NOT I REPLIED BUT YOU PARDON THIS OFFENCE ON CONDITION THAT YOU NEVER REPEAT IT AND MAY I COME TO SEE YOU NOW AND THEN PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY
WELL SAID THE DOCTOR NIAGARA IS A BIG THING ISN'T IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY TO ME WERE YOU NOT DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA WE WERE I FEEL TEMPTED TO WISH FOR ONE HOMICIDAL MOMENT THAT THE EARTH WOULD OPEN HER MOUTH AND SWALLOW THEM UP
STRENGTH AND WHITENESS THOUGHT JANE AS SHE PACED THE STEAMER'S DECK AND AFTER A TWO YEARS ABSENCE HER HEART WENT OUT TO HER NATIVE LAND THEN DOVER CASTLE CAUGHT HER EYE SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PEARLY LIGHT OF THAT SPRING AFTERNOON
BUT LET ME TELL YOU YOUNG MAN HERE HE PUT HIS FACE INTO MINE WITH AN IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL AIR SHE'S NOT WORTH IT AND HE CONFIRMED THE ASSERTION BY A SOLEMN NOD
THOUGH FROM ITS UNSIGHTLY AND SOMEWHAT DILAPIDATED CONDITION I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO OFFER IT FOR PERUSAL I HASTENED AWAY BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE ME
FOR YOU SERVED HEAVEN YOU KNOW OR SOUGHT TO I COULD NOT BECAUSE YOU SATURATED SIGHT AND I HAD NO MORE EYES FOR SORDID EXCELLENCE AS PARADISE AND WERE YOU LOST I WOULD BE
I THINK THAT EARTH SEEMS SO TO THOSE IN HEAVEN NOW THIS BEING COMFORT THEN THAT OTHER KIND WAS PAIN BUT WHY COMPARE
YOU UNSUSPECTING FEEL FOR ME ALMOST A LONELINESS
T IS THE MAJORITY IN THIS AS ALL PREVAILS ASSENT AND YOU ARE SANE DEMUR YOU'RE STRAIGHTWAY DANGEROUS AND HANDLED WITH A CHAIN
O FRIEND I WILL OF YOU

SOME THINGS THAT FLY THERE BE BIRDS HOURS THE BUMBLE BEE
HAD IN ITS CONSTITUTION THE FOLLOWING EXCELLENT ARTICLE
AND THE VALUE OF WILD GAME AS HUMAN FOOD SHOULD NO LONGER BE REGARDED AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ITS PURSUIT NINE IF RIGHTLY CONSERVED WILD GAME CONSTITUTES A VALUABLE ASSET
NEIGHBOR AND FRIEND AND BRIDEGROOM SPINNING UPON THE SHOALS HOW THEY WILL TELL THE SHIPWRECK WHEN WINTER SHAKES THE DOOR TILL THE CHILDREN ASK BUT THE FORTY DID THEY COME BACK NO MORE
BUT GALLANTER I KNOW WHO CHARGE WITHIN THE BOSOM THE CAVALRY OF WOE WHO WIN AND NATIONS DO NOT SEE WHO FALL AND NONE OBSERVE WHOSE DYING EYES NO COUNTRY REGARDS WITH PATRIOT LOVE
I HIDE MYSELF WITHIN MY FLOWER THAT WEARING ON YOUR BREAST YOU UNSUSPECTING WEAR ME TOO AND ANGELS KNOW THE REST I HIDE MYSELF WITHIN MY FLOWER
FIVE AN INDIAN HAS NO MORE RIGHT TO KILL WILD GAME
NO OTHER WAS DENIED I OFFERED BEING FOR IT THE MIGHTY MERCHANT SMILED BRAZIL HE TWIRLED A BUTTON WITHOUT A GLANCE MY WAY BUT MADAM IS THERE NOTHING ELSE THAT WE CAN SHOW TO DAY
IS HONORARY PRESIDENT HAS DECLARED THE LEADING FEATURE OF ITS OBJECTS IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS TO MAINTAIN THE STANDARD OF SPORTSMANSHIP IT IS NOT SQUANDERED BULLETS AND SWOLLEN BAGS WHICH APPEAL TO US
WHEN SHE CHANCED TO BE IN GOOD HUMOUR AND WHEN HAVING BROUGHT HER IRONING TABLE TO THE NURSERY HEARTH SHE ALLOWED US TO SIT ABOUT IT AND WHILE SHE GOT UP MISSUS REED'S LACE FRILLS AND CRIMPED HER NIGHTCAP BORDERS
TO LET WHITE WASHED WALLS VOUCH FOR CLEAN SHRINES
FORGIVE ME I CANNOT ENDURE IT LET ME BE PUNISHED SOME OTHER WAY I SHALL BE KILLED IF SILENCE
SHE NEVER SAW HIM STRIKE OR HEARD HIM ABUSE ME THOUGH HE DID BOTH NOW AND THEN IN HER VERY PRESENCE MORE FREQUENTLY HOWEVER BEHIND HER BACK
PLEADED BESSIE LET HER GO WAS THE ONLY ANSWER LOOSE BESSIE'S HAND CHILD YOU CANNOT SUCCEED IN GETTING OUT BY THESE MEANS BE ASSURED I ABHOR ARTIFICE PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN
I REALIZED HOW DEEPLY HE FELT ON THE SUBJECT AND HOPED HE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL FELIX PRAYED EARNESTLY THAT HE MIGHT BE ENABLED TO EAT A BITTER APPLE WITHOUT MAKING A FACE AND WHEN HE HAD PRAYED THREE NIGHTS AFTER THIS MANNER
AND FOR THE LOOK YOU HAD IN YOUR EYES TWO MINUTES SINCE YOU RAT
EITHER OF VISION OR CONCEPTION BUT ELIZA JUST PUT HER HEAD IN AT THE DOOR AND SAID AT ONCE
OH I SAW A LIGHT AND I THOUGHT A GHOST WOULD COME I HAD NOW GOT HOLD OF BESSIE'S HAND AND SHE DID NOT SNATCH IT FROM ME
BUT SHE ONLY WANTED TO BRING US ALL HERE I KNOW HER NAUGHTY TRICKS WHAT IS ALL THIS
GAMBLING WHAT WOULD AUNT JANE SAY IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO FIGHT CECILY DEMANDED OF PETER DON'T YOU DRAG MY AUNT JANE INTO THIS AFFAIR SAID PETER DARKLY YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE A PRESBYTERIAN
SOMETHING BAD MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO COME DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND FETCH YOU AWAY THEY WENT SHUTTING THE DOOR AND LOCKING IT BEHIND THEM THE RED ROOM WAS A SQUARE CHAMBER VERY SELDOM SLEPT IN
AND SO NO DOUBT SHE FELT IT I WAS A PRECOCIOUS ACTRESS IN HER EYES SHE SINCERELY LOOKED ON ME AS A COMPOUND OF VIRULENT PASSIONS MEAN SPIRIT AND DANGEROUS DUPLICITY BESSIE AND ABBOT HAVING RETREATED
STOOD OUT LIKE A TABERNACLE IN THE CENTRE THE TWO LARGE WINDOWS WITH THEIR BLINDS ALWAYS DRAWN DOWN WERE HALF SHROUDED IN FESTOONS AND FALLS OF SIMILAR DRAPERY THE CARPET WAS RED THE TABLE AT THE FOOT OF THE BED WAS COVERED WITH A CRIMSON CLOTH
NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION
BUT FOR US SHE THOUGHT ALMOST ANYTHING GOOD ENOUGH SHE WOULD FOR INSTANCE GIVE US THE THINNEST OF MILK WE SAID SHE SKIMMED IT THREE TIMES BEFORE SHE THOUGHT IT BLUE ENOUGH FOR US MY TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS DID NOT MIND IT SO MUCH AS I DID
THERE YOU ARE WITH YOUR HUGE CARCASS CRUSHING DOWN YOUR POOR LEGS ALL NIGHT LONG YOU DON'T EVEN CARE FOR YOUR OWN LEGS SO LONG AS YOU CAN EAT EAT AND SLEEP SLEEP YOU A HORSE INDEED BUT I TELL YOU I WAS LAME
HIS OPINION OF HIM WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM NANNY'S
OR OF CONTRAVENING OR EXPLAINING AWAY A PROVISION WHICH HAS BEEN OF LATE A REPEATED THEME OF THE EULOGIES OF THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE NEW CONSTITUTION AND THE WANT OF WHICH IN THAT PLAN HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH PLAUSIBLE ANIMADVERSION AND SEVERE CRITICISM
SAID NOT IN A QUESTIONING BUT IN A CONCLUDING TONE GOD DIDN'T MAKE THE FEES KIRSTY OH YES DAVIE GOD MADE EVERYTHING GOD DID MAKE THE FLEAS SAID KIRSTY DAVIE WAS SILENT FOR A WHILE
IN A RATHER DIFFERENT TONE I SAY DIAMOND I CAN'T BEAR TO HAVE AN HONEST OLD HORSE LIKE YOU THINK OF ME LIKE THAT I WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH IT WAS MY OWN FAULT THAT I FELL LAME I TOLD YOU SO RETURNED THE OTHER
IN A COUNTRY IMPERFECTLY SETTLED AND PROGRESSIVE IN IMPROVEMENT
THEY THINK I'M SILLY ADDED DIAMOND WITH ONE OF HIS SWEETEST SMILES WHAT MISTER RAYMOND THOUGHT I DARE HARDLY ATTEMPT TO PUT DOWN HERE
OH SHE'S NOT A BAD SORT SAID KIRSTY THOUGH I MUST SAY IF I WAS HER I WOULD TRY TO BE A LITTLE MORE AGREEABLE TO RETURN TO KIRSTY SHE WAS OUR CONSTANT RESORT
DIAMOND OPENED THE DOOR AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM AND DOWN THE STAIR AND INTO THE YARD HIS LITTLE HEART WAS IN A FLUTTER FOR HE HAD LONG GIVEN UP ALL THOUGHT OF SEEING HER AGAIN NEITHER NOW WAS HE TO SEE HER WHEN HE GOT OUT
HE DOESN'T DO IT FOR MY SAKE IF I WERE HIS OWN HORSE HE WOULD WORK ME AS HARD AS HE DOES YOU AND I'M PROUD TO BE SO WORKED I WOULDN'T BE AS FAT AS YOU NOT FOR ALL YOU'RE WORTH
CHAPTER FOUR KIRSTY MY FATHER HAD A HOUSEKEEPER A TRUSTY WOMAN HE CONSIDERED HER WE THOUGHT HER VERY OLD I SUPPOSE SHE WAS ABOUT FORTY SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT FOR SHE WAS GRIM FACED AND CENSORIOUS
CAME RUNNING IN GREAT DISTRESS TO KIRSTY CRYING FEE FEE BY WHICH HE MEANT TO INDICATE THAT A FLEA WAS RENDERING HIS LIFE MISERABLE
AND DIAMOND'S CHIEF PLEASURE SEEMED TO BE TO LIE AMONGST THEM AND BREATHE THE PURE AIR BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS DREAMING OF THE COUNTRY AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND AND TRYING TO RECALL THE SONGS THE RIVER USED TO SING FOR THIS WAS MORE LIKE BEING AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
AND MUST FOR A LONG TIME CONSTITUTE THE CHIEF PART OF THE REVENUE RAISED IN THIS COUNTRY THOSE OF THE DIRECT KIND WHICH PRINCIPALLY RELATE TO LAND AND BUILDINGS MAY ADMIT OF A RULE OF APPORTIONMENT EITHER THE VALUE OF LAND
BUT MY HUMBLE KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED TO THE SETTING OF A SQUADRON IN THE FIELD AND USING IT WHEN THERE I BEG LEAVE TO REFER YOU TO DOCTOR ARCHIBALD SITGREAVES A GENTLEMAN OF UNIVERSAL ATTAINMENTS AND UNBOUNDED PHILANTHROPY THE VERY MILK OF HUMAN SYMPATHIES AND A MORTAL FOE TO ALL INDISCRIMINATE CUTTING
THEREIN YOU SHOW YOUR SENSE SAID THE SURGEON APPROACHING THE SPINSTER WHO SAT HOLDING THE PALMS OF HER HANDS AND THE SOLES OF HER FEET TO THE GENIAL HEAT OF A FINE FIRE MAKING THE MOST OF COMFORT AMID ALL HER TROUBLES
ON THE MARCH ISABELLA EAGERLY INQUIRED HER BROTHER NO DISMOUNTED AND SEEMINGLY AT REST WAS THE REPLY THE WONDERING DRAGOON TURNED HIS GAZE ON THE COUNTENANCE OF HIS SISTER WHO SAT WITH HER EYE BENT ON THE CARPET IN UNCONSCIOUS ABSENCE BUT FOUND NO EXPLANATION
AND AS IT WAS WITHOUT THE POWDER IT WAS THEN THE FASHION TO WEAR IT FELL IN RAVEN BLACKNESS A FEW OF ITS LOCKS HAD FALLEN ON HER CHEEK GIVING ITS CHILLING WHITENESS BY THE CONTRAST A MORE DEADLY CHARACTER
REPLIED TWAS THE TROUBLES OF THE TIMES AND THE LOSS OF PROPERTY THAT BROUGHT HIM DOWN HE WASTED FROM DAY TO DAY AND ALL MY CARE AND ANXIETY WERE LOST FOR NOW HARVEY IS NO BETTER THAN A BEGGAR AND WHO IS THERE TO PAY ME FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE
IMPELLED BY A CHARM THAT WAS BEYOND HER CONTROL THE YOUTH HAD THROWN AN EARNEST LOOK AT FRANCES AS SOON AS HIS SISTER RAISED HERSELF FROM HIS ARMS AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE FIRST GLANCE AT THE LOVELY LINEAMENTS OF OUR HEROINE
THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR SITGREAVES WHO IN SOME ALARM NOTICED THE INCREASE OF FEVERISH SYMPTOMS IN HIS PATIENT ENFORCED THIS MANDATE AND THE TROOPER WITHDREW TO PAY A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE TO ROANOKE WHO HAD BEEN AN EQUAL SUFFERER WITH HIMSELF IN THEIR LAST NIGHT'S SOMERSAULT
TOLERATED THE INTERRUPTIONS WITH A VERY ILL GRACE AND ONCE FOR AN INSTANT HE VENTURED TO STEAL SOFTLY TO THE BED OF HIS OBSTINATE COMRADE AND WAS NEAR SUCCEEDING IN OBTAINING A TOUCH OF HIS PULSE WHEN A TERRIBLE OATH SWORN BY THE TROOPER IN A DREAM
HAD WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEW GOOD FIRES UPON THEM IN FLANK WE SHOULD HAVE SENT THESE BRAVE VIRGINIANS TO THE RIGHT ABOUT AYE AND THAT IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME CRIED THE COLONEL MAKING THE OTHER LEG FOLLOW ITS COMPANION THEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO ROUT THE GUIDES YOU KNOW AND THE MOVEMENT GAVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE
BUT I THINK MISTER DUNWOODIE HAS TAKEN A LIBERTY THAT EXCEEDS THE RIGHTS OF CONSANGUINITY HE HAS MADE OUR FATHER'S HOUSE A HOSPITAL WE OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL THAT NONE OF THE PATIENTS IT CONTAINS ARE DEARER TO US YOUR BROTHER IS ONE TRUE TRUE INTERRUPTED FRANCES BLUSHING TO THE EYES
INDEED I CAN EASILY COMPREHEND THE MORTIFICATION YOU MUST HAVE FELT IN HAVING ONE SO SELF WILLED TO DEAL WITH RETURNED THE SURGEON GLANCING HIS EYES REPROACHFULLY AT HIS COMRADE BUT YOU SHOULD RISE SUPERIOR TO SUCH OPINIONS AND PITY THE IGNORANCE BY WHICH THEY ARE ENGENDERED
IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR A MAN TO GET A WIFE AT ALL IN SUCH A PREDICARY DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD MISS PEYTON I SELDOM TROUBLE MYSELF WITH SUCH THINGS SAID THE LADY GRAVELY DURING THIS DIALOGUE CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN STUDYING THE COUNTENANCE AND MANNER OF THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH A MOST LUDICROUS GRAVITY
PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BRAIN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN SIMPLY THAT THE ARTERIES WHICH CARRY THEM THITHER PROCEED FROM THE HEART
INTO THESE THE BLOOD OF NECESSITY FLOWS FROM THE HOLLOW VEIN INTO THE RIGHT AND FROM THE VENOUS ARTERY INTO THE LEFT BECAUSE THESE TWO VESSELS ARE ALWAYS FULL OF BLOOD AND THEIR ORIFICES WHICH ARE TURNED TOWARDS THE HEART CANNOT THEN BE CLOSED
MUSCLES NERVES ARTERIES VEINS AND OTHER PARTS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE BODY OF EACH ANIMAL SUCH PERSONS WILL LOOK UPON THIS BODY AS A MACHINE MADE BY THE HANDS OF GOD WHICH IS INCOMPARABLY BETTER ARRANGED
APPOSITELY TO REPLY TO WHAT IS SAID IN ITS PRESENCE AS MEN OF THE LOWEST GRADE OF INTELLECT CAN DO THE SECOND TEST IS THAT ALTHOUGH SUCH MACHINES MIGHT EXECUTE MANY THINGS WITH EQUAL OR PERHAPS GREATER PERFECTION THAN ANY OF US
AND OF HAVING BEEN THE FIRST TO TEACH THAT THERE ARE MANY SMALL PASSAGES AT THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES THROUGH WHICH THE BLOOD RECEIVED BY THEM FROM THE HEART PASSES INTO THE SMALL BRANCHES OF THE VEINS
FOR I EVEN EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT IT POSSESSED NONE OF THOSE FORMS OR QUALITIES WHICH ARE SO DEBATED IN THE SCHOOLS NOR IN GENERAL ANYTHING THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH IS NOT SO NATURAL TO OUR MINDS
TWO CANALS IN SIZE EQUAL TO OR LARGER THAN THE PRECEDING VIZ THE VENOUS ARTERY ARTERIA VENOSA LIKEWISE INAPPROPRIATELY THUS DESIGNATED BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY A VEIN WHICH COMES FROM THE LUNGS
AND FINALLY THAT THIS HEAT IS CAPABLE OF CAUSING ANY DROP OF BLOOD THAT PASSES INTO THE CAVITIES RAPIDLY TO EXPAND AND DILATE JUST AS ALL LIQUORS DO WHEN ALLOWED TO FALL DROP BY DROP INTO A HIGHLY HEATED VESSEL
AND IF ATTENTION BE GIVEN IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED ONLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE HEART
WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF THE BLOOD BE WITHDRAWN FROM ANY PART THE HEAT IS LIKEWISE WITHDRAWN BY THE SAME MEANS AND ALTHOUGH THE HEART WERE AS HOT AS GLOWING IRON IT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF WARMING THE FEET AND HANDS
WHEREAS THE OTHERS BEING ROUND ARE MORE CONVENIENTLY CLOSED WITH THREE BESIDES I WISH SUCH PERSONS TO OBSERVE THAT THE GRAND ARTERY AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN ARE OF MUCH HARDER AND FIRMER TEXTURE
I RESOLVED TO LEAVE ALL THE PEOPLE HERE TO THEIR DISPUTES AND TO SPEAK ONLY OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A NEW WORLD IF GOD WERE NOW TO CREATE SOMEWHERE IN THE IMAGINARY SPACES
BUT THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE JOINED AND UNITED MORE CLOSELY TO THE BODY IN ORDER TO HAVE SENSATIONS AND APPETITES SIMILAR TO OURS AND THUS CONSTITUTE A REAL MAN
AT THAT MOMENT SHE HEARD THE ROARING OF THE GREAT LIONS WHO HAD FOUND OUT THAT SHE WAS NEAR AND WERE COMING TO LOOK FOR HER
SHE WAS DRESSED ALMOST ALWAYS IN THE PRETTIEST FROCKS AS A FAIRY OR AS A QUEEN GOING OUT TO HUNT AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FOLLOWED HER DRESSED AS FOREST FAIRIES AND TO MAKE HER MORE VAIN THAN EVER
AND YOU WILL SOON FIND OUT THAT I AM MORE POWERFUL THAN YOU ARE WRETCHED LITTLE MONSTER SAID THE KING DO YOU DARE TO CALL YOURSELF THE PRINCESS'S LOVER AND TO LAY CLAIM TO SUCH A TREASURE
AND KNEW IN A MOMENT THAT THIS MUST BE THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT FOR HER FEET WERE THE ONE THING SHE COULD NOT CHANGE HOWEVER PRETTY SHE MIGHT MAKE HER FACE WITHOUT SEEMING TO HAVE NOTICED ANYTHING HE SAID IN A CONFIDENTIAL WAY
PREPARATIONS WERE BEGUN AT ONCE FOR THE GRANDEST WEDDING THAT HAD EVER BEEN HELD AT THE PALACE THE KING OF THE GOLD MINES SENT SUCH IMMENSE SUMS OF MONEY
AND SAW IT COVERED WITH FLOWERS AND FRUIT SHE STOPPED AND BEGAN TO GATHER SOME OF THE ORANGES AND THEN PUTTING DOWN HER BASKET SHE SAT DOWN TO EAT THEM BUT WHEN IT WAS TIME TO GO ON AGAIN THE BASKET HAD DISAPPEARED AND THOUGH SHE LOOKED EVERYWHERE
FIVE OR SIX TIMES A DAY JUST TO PLEASE HER
DO LEAVE ME IN PEACE MADAM I DON'T WANT TO CARE FOR ANYONE BUT YOU WOULD BE VERY HAPPY WITH ANY OF THESE PRINCES SAID THE QUEEN
THE QUEEN WAS SO OVERJOYED THAT SHE HAD HARDLY BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP AT ALL AND SHE GOT UP BEFORE IT WAS LIGHT TO GIVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS AND TO CHOOSE THE JEWELS THAT THE PRINCESS WAS TO WEAR THESE WERE NOTHING LESS THAN DIAMONDS
SHE GAVE HIM BACK HIS SIGHT BUT WITHOUT RELEASING HIM FROM HIS CHAINS AND BY HER MAGIC POWER SHE APPEARED BEFORE HIM AS A YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL FAIRY AND PRETENDED TO HAVE COME THERE QUITE BY CHANCE WHAT DO I SEE SHE CRIED
WHEN THE PRINCESS SAW ALL THESE THINGS AND REMEMBERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED SHE TOO FELL INTO THE DEEPEST SADNESS
BUT JUST AS THEY PASSED SHE LOOKED UP AND SAW THE KING AND THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT NOW THE FAIRY WAS SO CLEVER THAT SHE COULD NOT ONLY SEEM BEAUTIFUL TO THE KING BUT EVEN THE POOR PRINCESS THOUGHT HER THE MOST LOVELY BEING SHE HAD EVER SEEN
AND SHE LEANED HEAVILY UPON A CRUTCH THIS STRANGE OLD WOMAN WITHOUT SAYING A SINGLE WORD HOBBLED THREE TIMES ROUND THE GALLERY FOLLOWED BY THE BASILISKS THEN STOPPING IN THE MIDDLE
SOME PEOPLE'S OPINION OF WHAT IS GOOD OR BAD FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHILE VERY OFTEN IT DOES NOT EVEN MEAN THAT THE PUBLIC WITH THE MOST PERFECT INDIFFERENCE PASSING OVER THE PLEASURE OR CONVENIENCE OF THOSE WHOSE CONDUCT THEY CENSURE AND CONSIDERING ONLY THEIR OWN PREFERENCE
THERE ARE MANY WHO CONSIDER AS AN INJURY TO THEMSELVES ANY CONDUCT WHICH THEY HAVE A DISTASTE FOR AND RESENT IT AS AN OUTRAGE TO THEIR FEELINGS AS A RELIGIOUS BIGOT WHEN CHARGED WITH DISREGARDING THE RELIGIOUS FEELINGS OF OTHERS
IF PROTECTION AGAINST THEMSELVES IS CONFESSEDLY DUE TO CHILDREN AND PERSONS UNDER AGE
THE NEXT EXAMPLE HOWEVER SHALL BE TAKEN FROM AN INTERFERENCE WITH LIBERTY WHICH WE HAVE BY NO MEANS PASSED ALL DANGER OF WHEREVER THE PURITANS HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL AS IN NEW ENGLAND AND IN GREAT BRITAIN AT THE TIME OF THE COMMONWEALTH
AND ITS BEST EFFORTS ARE NOT ALWAYS IN INDIVIDUAL CASES ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL ONES BUT IT IS PERFECTLY WELL ABLE TO MAKE THE RISING GENERATION AS A WHOLE AS GOOD AS AND A LITTLE BETTER THAN ITSELF
OR WHO CAN BLAME PEOPLE FOR DESIRING TO SUPPRESS WHAT THEY REGARD AS A SCANDAL IN THE SIGHT OF GOD AND MAN NO STRONGER CASE CAN BE SHOWN FOR PROHIBITING ANYTHING WHICH IS REGARDED AS A PERSONAL IMMORALITY
WE ARE NOT BOUND FOR EXAMPLE TO SEEK HIS SOCIETY WE HAVE A RIGHT TO AVOID IT THOUGH NOT TO PARADE THE AVOIDANCE FOR WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE SOCIETY MOST ACCEPTABLE TO US
NO MORE THAN BETWEEN THE DESIRE OF A THIEF TO TAKE A PURSE AND THE DESIRE OF THE RIGHT OWNER TO KEEP IT AND A PERSON'S TASTE IS AS MUCH HIS OWN PECULIAR CONCERN AS HIS OPINION OR HIS PURSE
NOR IS THERE ANYTHING WHICH TENDS MORE TO DISCREDIT AND FRUSTRATE THE BETTER MEANS OF INFLUENCING CONDUCT THAN A RESORT TO THE WORSE IF THERE BE AMONG THOSE WHOM IT IS ATTEMPTED TO COERCE INTO PRUDENCE OR TEMPERANCE ANY OF THE MATERIAL
IF WE DO NOT INTERFERE BENEVOLENTLY BY SHOWING INTEREST OR CONCERN FOR HIM IT IS FAR OTHERWISE IF HE HAS INFRINGED THE RULES NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY
HOW MUCH OF HUMAN LIFE SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO INDIVIDUALITY AND HOW MUCH TO SOCIETY EACH WILL RECEIVE ITS PROPER SHARE IF EACH HAS THAT WHICH MORE PARTICULARLY CONCERNS IT
BUT WHERE HAS THERE BEEN SEEN A PUBLIC WHICH SET ANY SUCH LIMIT TO ITS CENSORSHIP OR WHEN DOES THE PUBLIC TROUBLE ITSELF ABOUT UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE IN ITS INTERFERENCES WITH PERSONAL CONDUCT IT IS SELDOM THINKING OF ANYTHING
TO BE FIXED ON SOME EQUITABLE PRINCIPLE OF THE LABOURS AND SACRIFICES INCURRED FOR DEFENDING THE SOCIETY OR ITS MEMBERS FROM INJURY AND MOLESTATION THESE CONDITIONS SOCIETY IS JUSTIFIED IN ENFORCING AT ALL COSTS TO THOSE WHO ENDEAVOUR TO WITHHOLD FULFILMENT
IT WAS BECAUSE JIMMY CALLED HIM SAINT CLAIR THAT SAINT CLAIR POUNDED HIM ON THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL I HEARD OF THE POUNDING BUT NOT OFFICIALLY SO I DON'T THINK I'LL TAKE ANY NOTICE OF IT YESTERDAY I WAS TRYING TO TEACH LOTTIE WRIGHT TO DO ADDITION I SAID
ESPECIALLY AS SHE DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHERE THE MOUSE HAD GONE BUT SHE DECIDED NOT TO WHO COULD TAKE ANY COMFORT OUT OF HYSTERICS WITH A TEACHER SO WHITE FACED AND SO BLAZING EYED STANDING BEFORE ONE WHO PUT THAT MOUSE IN MY DESK SAID ANNE
I MUST I HAVE SOME SEWING TO DO FOR DORA THIS EVENING BESIDES DAVY IS PROBABLY BREAKING MARILLA'S HEART WITH SOME NEW MISCHIEF BY THIS TIME THIS MORNING THE FIRST THING HE SAID WAS WHERE DOES THE DARK GO ANNE I WANT TO KNOW
BUT THE OLDEST TWIN SAYS IT WAS ONLY A FEW MINUTES YOU SEE IN THE SUNSET LAND THE TIME IS EVER SO MUCH LONGER THAN IT IS HERE YOUR LOVING PUPIL PAUL IRVING
THE LUCKLESS IMPROVERS EXPECTED THAT AVONLEA WOULD BE MORE PREJUDICED THAN EVER AGAINST THEM BUT INSTEAD PUBLIC SYMPATHY VEERED AROUND IN THEIR FAVOR
EVERY MORN IS THE WORLD MADE NEW SANG ANNE AS SHE DRESSED OWING TO THE SNOW SHE HAD TO GO AROUND BY THE ROAD TO SCHOOL AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS CERTAINLY AN IMPISH COINCIDENCE THAT ANTHONY PYE SHOULD COME PLOUGHING ALONG JUST AS SHE LEFT THE GREEN GABLES LANE
A JONAH DAY IT REALLY BEGAN THE NIGHT BEFORE WITH A RESTLESS WAKEFUL VIGIL OF GRUMBLING TOOTHACHE WHEN ANNE AROSE IN THE DULL BITTER WINTER MORNING SHE FELT THAT LIFE WAS FLAT STALE AND UNPROFITABLE
HE IS OLL STRIPED AND HE GOT ONE OF HIS EARS FROZ OF LAST WINTER ONLY FOR THAT HE WOULD BE A GOOD LOOKING CAT MY UNKLE HAS ADOPTED A CAT IT COME TO HIS HOUSE ONE DAY AND WOUDENT GO AWAY AND UNKLE SAYS IT HAS FORGOT MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE EVER KNOWED
MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE CAME UP THE NEXT SATURDAY AND CONFIRMED THIS WELL ANNE I GUESS YOU'VE WON OVER ANTHONY PYE THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS HE BELIEVES YOU ARE SOME GOOD AFTER ALL EVEN IF YOU ARE A GIRL SAYS THAT WHIPPING YOU GAVE HIM WAS JUST AS GOOD AS A MAN'S
BUT IF YOU WERE A WIDOW THERE'D BE NO DANGER OF EITHER THE MOST REMARKABLE WISH WAS SALLY BELL'S SHE WANTED A HONEYMOON
I WISH YOU COULD SEE SOME OF THEIR COMPOSITIONS SO MUCH DO I WISH IT THAT I'LL SEND YOU COPIES OF SOME WRITTEN RECENTLY LAST WEEK I TOLD THE FOURTH CLASS I WANTED THEM TO WRITE ME LETTERS ABOUT ANYTHING THEY PLEASED ADDING BY WAY OF SUGGESTION THAT THEY MIGHT TELL ME OF SOME PLACE THEY HAD VISITED
EVERYBODY REALIZED THAT EVEN THE EXPLOSION HAD NOT CLEARED THE TEACHER'S MENTAL ATMOSPHERE NOBODY EXCEPT ANTHONY PYE DARED WHISPER A WORD NED CLAY ACCIDENTALLY SQUEAKED HIS PENCIL WHILE WORKING A SUM CAUGHT ANNE'S EYE AND WISHED THE FLOOR WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW HIM UP
TEACHING IS REALLY VERY INTERESTING WORK WROTE ANNE TO A QUEEN'S ACADEMY CHUM JANE SAYS SHE THINKS IT IS MONOTONOUS BUT I DON'T FIND IT SO SOMETHING FUNNY IS ALMOST SURE TO HAPPEN EVERY DAY AND THE CHILDREN SAY SUCH AMUSING THINGS
WAS SHE PRETTY HER FIGURE MAY HAVE BEEN GOOD ONCE THE FLATS THEIR ONLY OUTLOOK HUNG LIKE AN ORNATE CURTAIN BETWEEN MARGARET AND THE WELTER OF LONDON HER THOUGHTS TURNED SADLY TO HOUSE HUNTING
NEVER SAID MISSUS WILCOX GRAVELY
BUT I THINK SHE SUSPECTED ME UP TO THE LAST BAGS I WRITING TO AUNT JULEY ABOUT THIS NOW MEG REMEMBER BAGS I BAG IT BY ALL MEANS
I HAVE LONG WANTED TO HEAR WHAT IS SAID ON THE OTHER SIDE THE OTHER SIDE THEN YOU DO DISAGREE OH GOOD GIVE US YOUR SIDE I HAVE NO SIDE BUT MY HUSBAND HER VOICE SOFTENED THE CHILL INCREASED
THE LEAVES WERE FALLING BY MIDSUMMER THE SUN SHONE THROUGH DIRT WITH AN ADMIRED OBSCURITY TO SPEAK AGAINST LONDON IS NO LONGER FASHIONABLE THE EARTH AS AN ARTISTIC CULT HAS HAD ITS DAY
OVER TWO YEARS PASSED AND THE SCHLEGEL HOUSEHOLD CONTINUED TO LEAD ITS LIFE OF CULTURED BUT NOT IGNOBLE EASE STILL SWIMMING GRACEFULLY ON THE GREY TIDES OF LONDON
MAKING NO MORE OF BOXER THAN IF HE HAD BEEN A HOUSE LAMB THE CARRIER AND HIS WIFE EXCHANGED A LOOK OF PERPLEXITY THE STRANGER RAISED HIS HEAD AND GLANCING FROM THE LATTER TO THE FORMER SAID YOUR DAUGHTER MY GOOD FRIEND
CLIPPED WORDS FORMLESS SENTENCES POTTED EXPRESSIONS OF APPROVAL OR DISGUST MONTH BY MONTH THINGS WERE STEPPING LIVELIER BUT TO WHAT GOAL THE POPULATION STILL ROSE BUT WHAT WAS THE QUALITY OF THE MEN BORN
AND DWARFED THEIR ACTIVITIES THERE WAS NO BITTERNESS IN MISSUS WILCOX THERE WAS NOT EVEN CRITICISM SHE WAS LOVABLE AND NO UNGRACIOUS OR UNCHARITABLE WORD HAD PASSED HER LIPS
SOON FOUND SOME ACCOMMODATING BUSINESS TO CALL HIM THITHER WITH A HEART FULL OF THE MATTER MISSUS VERNON WAITED ON LADY SUSAN SHORTLY AFTER HER ARRIVAL IN TOWN AND WAS MET WITH SUCH AN EASY AND CHEERFUL AFFECTION AS
WANT CIVILIZATION WITHOUT ACTIVITY WHICH I EXPECT IS WHAT WE SHALL FIND IN THE OTHER PLACE
CONCLUDED BY DECLINING ENTIRELY TO PROFIT BY SUCH UNEXAMPLED ATTENTION MISSUS VERNON PERSEVERED HOWEVER IN THE OFFER OF IT AND THOUGH LADY SUSAN CONTINUED TO RESIST HER RESISTANCE IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS SEEMED
AND FOR DISCUSSING WITH HUMILITY I AM TOO OLD WE NEVER DISCUSS ANYTHING
SAID MARGARET A LITTLE SADLY THEY ARE TOO DIFFICULT FOR ME I CAN ONLY LOOK AT THE MEN AN EMPIRE BORES ME SO FAR BUT I CAN APPRECIATE THE HEROISM THAT BUILDS IT UP LONDON BORES ME BUT WHAT THOUSANDS OF SPLENDID PEOPLE ARE LABOURING TO MAKE LONDON
O KARAM GOSAIN HOW FAR OFF ARE YOU BUT THE COW SAID TO THEM GO TO THE BANKS OF THE GANGES THEN THEY CAME TO A BUFFALO AND WENT TO MILK IT BUT IT LOWERED ITS HEAD AND CHARGED THEM
WHILE HE HAD BEEN TOSSED BY MANY EMOTIONS HE HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF AILMENTS NOW THE BESET HIM
AND MEN SLOWING TO HIS DREARY PACE WERE WALKING WITH HIM THEY WERE DISCUSSING HIS PLIGHT QUESTIONING HIM AND GIVING HIM ADVICE IN A DOGGED WAY HE REPELLED THEM
HE MOVED WITH MYSTERIOUS PURPOSE AND ALL OF THE YOUTH'S OFFERS HE BRUSHED ASIDE NO NO LEAVE ME BE LEAVE ME BE THE YOUTH HAD TO FOLLOW
WHATEVER IT WAS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM HE SAID THERE LAY THE FAULT THE HASTE OF THE COLUMN TO REACH THE BATTLE SEEMED TO THE FORLORN YOUNG MAN TO BE SOMETHING MUCH FINER THAN STOUT FIGHTING HEROES HE THOUGHT
AS IF HE WERE TAKING INFINITE CARE NOT TO AROUSE THE PASSION OF HIS WOUNDS AS HE WENT ON HE SEEMED ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A PLACE LIKE ONE WHO GOES TO CHOOSE A GRAVE
OF THE OTHER LABOURERS AND THE LABOURERS ALSO TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS NOT SUITABLE FOR HIM TO WORK AS A LABOURER HIMSELF BUT DHARMU SAID
AND AS HE SAW THEIR DRIPPING CORPSES ON AN IMAGINED FIELD HE SAID THAT HE WAS THEIR MURDERER AGAIN HE THOUGHT
AS THE LATTER SLOWLY TURNED HIS WAXLIKE FEATURES TOWARD HIM THE YOUTH SCREAMED
HE DENOUNCED HIMSELF AS A VILLAIN HE SAID THAT HE WAS THE MOST UNUTTERABLY SELFISH MAN IN EXISTENCE HIS MIND PICTURED THE SOLDIERS WHO WOULD PLACE THEIR DEFIANT BODIES BEFORE THE SPEAR OF THE YELLING BATTLE FIEND
THEY BEGAN TO HAVE THOUGHTS OF A SOLEMN CEREMONY THERE WAS SOMETHING RITE LIKE IN THESE MOVEMENTS OF THE DOOMED SOLDIER AND THERE WAS A RESEMBLANCE IN HIM TO A DEVOTEE OF A MAD RELIGION BLOOD SUCKING MUSCLE WRENCHING BONE CRUSHING
KARAM GOSAIN PROMISED THEM THAT ON THEIR WAY BACK THEY SHOULD TAKE POSSESSION OF ALL AND THEY DID SO AND MOUNTED ON THE ELEPHANT AND RETURNED TO THEIR HOME WITH GREAT WEALTH
I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
TOOK PLACE AT HIS RESIDENCE IN WASHINGTON D C JUNE SECOND EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE THE CEREMONIES WERE EXTREMELY SIMPLE CONSISTING MERELY OF VIEWING THE REMAINS BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS AND A FUNERAL ORATION BY COLONEL ROBERT G INGERSOLL
AND YET THE BEAUTIFUL CUNEGONDE HAS NOT ARRIVED
THIS IS ONE OF THE MISERIES OF THE TRADE YESTERDAY I WAS ROBBED AND BEATEN BY AN OFFICER YET TO DAY I MUST PUT ON GOOD HUMOUR TO PLEASE A FRIAR CANDIDE WANTED NO MORE CONVINCING HE OWNED THAT MARTIN WAS IN THE RIGHT
HE ONE DAY GAVE HER SO EFFECTUAL A REMEDY TO CURE HER OF A SLIGHT COLD THAT SHE DIED TWO HOURS AFTER IN MOST HORRID CONVULSIONS THE WIFE'S RELATIONS PROSECUTED THE HUSBAND HE TOOK FLIGHT AND I WAS THROWN INTO JAIL
THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS A MAN OF SIXTY AND VERY RICH HE RECEIVED THE TWO TRAVELLERS WITH POLITE INDIFFERENCE WHICH PUT CANDIDE A LITTLE OUT OF COUNTENANCE BUT WAS NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO MARTIN
JUST IN THE HAPPIEST SUNNIEST HOUR OF ALL THE VOYAGE WHILE EAGER WINDS ARE KISSING EVERY SAIL TO DASH AGAINST THE UNSEEN ROCK AND IN AN INSTANT HEAR THE BILLOWS ROAR OVER A SUNKEN SHIP
BROTHER OF THE DECEASED A LARGE NUMBER OF DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMEN WERE PRESENT INCLUDING SECRETARY SHERMAN ASSISTANT SECRETARY HAWLEY SENATORS BLAINE VORHEES PADDOCK ALLISON LOGAN
MY PARENTS FORCED ME AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN TO PUT ON THIS DETESTABLE HABIT TO INCREASE THE FORTUNE OF A CURSED ELDER BROTHER WHOM GOD CONFOUND JEALOUSY DISCORD AND FURY DWELL IN THE CONVENT
IT IS TRUE I HAVE PREACHED A FEW BAD SERMONS THAT HAVE BROUGHT ME IN A LITTLE MONEY OF WHICH THE PRIOR STOLE HALF WHILE THE REST SERVES TO MAINTAIN MY GIRLS
BUT IN THE NIGHT OF DEATH HOPE SEES A STAR AND LISTENING LOVE CAN HEAR THE RUSTLE OF A WING HE WHO SLEEPS HERE WHEN DYING MISTAKING THE APPROACH OF DEATH FOR THE RETURN OF HEALTH
HE CONSULTED PANGLOSS MARTIN AND THE FAITHFUL CACAMBO
OR HE WHO JOURNEYS ALL THE LENGTH OF LIFE'S UNEVEN ROAD PAINFULLY TAKING THE LAST SLOW STEPS WITH STAFF AND CRUTCH EVERY CRADLE ASKS US WHENCE AND EVERY COFFIN WHITHER
THOSE WHO WERE SINCERE HAVE OWNED TO ME THAT THE POEM MADE THEM FALL ASLEEP YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE IT IN THEIR LIBRARY AS A MONUMENT OF ANTIQUITY OR LIKE THOSE RUSTY MEDALS WHICH ARE NO LONGER OF USE IN COMMERCE
AND HIS ACCOUNT OF A BAD DINNER OR OF HIS LOW QUARREL BETWEEN ONE RUPILIUS WHOSE WORDS HE SAYS WERE FULL OF POISONOUS FILTH AND ANOTHER WHOSE LANGUAGE WAS IMBUED WITH VINEGAR I HAVE READ WITH MUCH DISTASTE HIS INDELICATE VERSES AGAINST OLD WOMEN AND WITCHES
