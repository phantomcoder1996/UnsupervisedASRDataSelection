THIS IS A USEFUL MARKET CENTER AN INTERESTING PIONEER POST BUT IT IS NOT A HOME FOR ME MEDITATED THE STRANGER CAROL KENNICOTT SUGGESTED I'D PHONE FOR A FLIVVER BUT IT'D TAKE QUITE A WHILE FOR IT TO GET HERE LET'S WALK
AND I'M GOING TO SEE MY BABY ALL THE WORDS HE'LL BE ABLE TO SAY NOW IT'S A NEW START EVERYTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT THUS ON APRIL FIRST AMONG DAPPLED HILLS AND THE BRONZE OF SCRUB OAKS
SHE BEGAN TO THINK WITH UNPLEASANT LUCIDITY SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THE PEOPLE LIKED HER SHE HAD GONE TO THE WOMEN AT AFTERNOON COFFEES TO THE MERCHANTS IN THEIR STORES WITH SO MANY OUTPOURING COMMENTS AND WHIMSIES
FROM THE TOP GALLERY I WALKED IN GRAMERCY PARK AND I READ OH EVERYTHING THROUGH A COUSIN I LEARNED THAT JULIUS FLICKERBAUGH WAS SICK AND NEEDED A PARTNER I CAME HERE JULIUS GOT WELL
NO IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THAT I THINK IT'S A GREATNESS OF LIFE A REFUSAL TO BE CONTENT WITH EVEN THE HEALTHIEST MUD DON'T YOU KNOW THAT NOBODY EVER SOLVED A PROBLEM BY RUNNING AWAY FROM IT PERHAPS
THAT SHE HADN'T GIVEN THEM A CHANCE TO BETRAY THEIR OPINIONS OF HER THE MEN SMILED BUT DID THEY LIKE HER SHE WAS LIVELY AMONG THE WOMEN BUT WAS SHE ONE OF THEM
THEY WERE NOT AT HOME LIKE A CHILD WHO HAS NO ONE TO PLAY WITH SHE LOITERED THROUGH THE DARK HALL SHE SAW A LIGHT UNDER AN OFFICE DOOR SHE KNOCKED TO THE PERSON WHO OPENED SHE MURMURED DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE THE PERRYS ARE
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO TAKE HIM WITH ME SUPPOSE I REFUSE YOU WON'T FORLORNLY UH CARRIE WHAT THE DEVIL IS IT YOU WANT ANYWAY OH CONVERSATION
CYNICAL SANTA CLAUS CHILDREN LOVED HIM AND HE SNEAKED AWAY FROM WORK TO TELL THEM IMPROBABLE STORIES OF SEA FARING AND HORSE TRADING AND BEARS THE CHILDREN'S PARENTS EITHER LAUGHED AT HIM OR HATED HIM HE WAS THE ONE DEMOCRAT IN TOWN
THAT'LL BE ABOUT ALL FROM YOU I'VE STOOD FOR YOUR SNEERING AT THIS TOWN AND SAYING HOW UGLY AND DULL IT IS I'VE STOOD FOR YOUR REFUSING TO APPRECIATE GOOD FELLOWS LIKE SAM I'VE EVEN STOOD FOR YOUR RIDICULING OUR WATCH GOPHER PRAIRIE GROW CAMPAIGN
A WESTERN MINING SETTLEMENT LIKE A TUMOR A BOOMING SEMI CITY WITH PARKS AND CLEVER ARCHITECTS VISITED BY FAMOUS PIANISTS AND UNCTUOUS LECTURERS BUT IRRITABLE FROM A STRUGGLE BETWEEN UNION LABOR AND THE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
HER DISCOVERY THAT SHE REALLY COULD GET AWAY FROM MAIN STREET WAS AS SWEET AS THE DISCOVERY OF LOVE KENNICOTT NEVER CONSENTED DEFINITELY AT MOST HE AGREED TO A PUBLIC THEORY THAT SHE WAS GOING TO TAKE A SHORT TRIP
SHE DID NOT HUNT FOR THE SORT OF VEILING SHE WANTED SHE TOOK WHAT SHE COULD GET AND ONLY AT HOWLAND AND GOULD'S WAS THERE SUCH A LUXURY AS CANNED ASPARAGUS ROUTINE CARE WAS ALL SHE COULD DEVOTE TO THE HOUSE
HERE IN GOPHER PRAIRIE WE'VE CLEARED THE FIELDS AND BECOME SOFT SO WE MAKE OURSELVES UNHAPPY ARTIFICIALLY AT GREAT EXPENSE AND EXERTION METHODISTS DISLIKING EPISCOPALIANS THE MAN WITH THE HUDSON LAUGHING AT THE MAN WITH THE FLIVVER
OH PLEASE WAIT TILL MY GENERATION HAS STOPPED REBELLING BEFORE YOURS STARTS IN WHAT'S A GENERATION IT'S A RAY IN THE ILLUMINATION OF THE SPIRIT THAT'S FOOLISH
PASSED HER THE GINGERBREAD AND SCALLOPED POTATOES AT CHURCH SUPPERS AND IN GENERAL MADE HER VERY UNHAPPY AND LONELY SO THAT SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENLIST IN THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE ORGANIZATION AND BE ALLOWED TO GO TO JAIL
SHE LOOKED ABOUT WITH IMPERSONAL EYES BUT KENNICOTT THROUGH RAIN BLURRED LASHES CAUGHT THE GLORY THAT WAS BACK HOME
AS WELL AS IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR FRIENDS IT WILL BE GREAT SPORT I HEAR YOUR MAJESTY AND I OBEY YOUR MAJESTY ANSWERED PANG AND WENT WITH HIS NOMES INTO THE PASSAGE IN A FEW MINUTES HE RETURNED
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE ONE OF YOUR OFFICERS THE PRIVATE ASKED SHAGGY BUT AT ONCE EVERY OFFICER BEGAN TO PROTEST AND THE QUEEN OF OOGABOO SHOOK HER HEAD AS SHE REPLIED THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE A PRIVATE SOLDIER MUST BE A TERRIBLE FIGHTER
YOU CAN SOON BRING THE NOME KING TO REASON SO IT WAS DECIDED TO WAIT NO LONGER SHAGGY WALKED THROUGH THE ENTRANCE FIRST AND AFTER HIM CAME THE OTHERS THEY HAD NO THOUGHT OF DANGER TO THEMSELVES
I AM SURE SHE WAS RIGHT WAILED THE PRISONER BUT RUGGEDO WANTED TO INJURE ME TO MAKE ME UGLY IN THE EYES OF ALL THE WORLD SO HE PERFORMED A WICKED ENCHANTMENT I WENT TO BED BEAUTIFUL OR YOU MIGHT SAY HANDSOME TO BE VERY MODEST
THAT MUST BE MY DEAR BROTHER EXCLAIMED SHAGGY YES IT MUST BE ASSENTED KALIKO NO ONE ELSE INHABITS THIS SPLENDID DOME SO THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKE BUT WHY DOES HE HIDE AMONG THOSE GREEN TREES
SAID GENERAL CONE MUSTERING COURAGE TO ADVANCE TO THE WELL BUT JUST THEN HE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF TIK TOK AND SHAGGY AND AT ONCE FELL UPON HIS KNEES TREMBLING AND FRIGHTENED AND CRIED OUT
AT THAT TIME YOU HAD NO GUN SAID POLYCHROME
AS IF TO ASSIST HIM A STRONG CURRENT OF WARM AIR WAS DIRECTED AGAINST THE COPPER MAN WHICH QUICKLY DRIED HIM SOON HE WAS ABLE TO SAY
AS ONE OF THE OFFICERS STEPPED ON A SHARP STONE OR KNOCKED HIS FUNNYBONE AGAINST HIS NEIGHBOR'S SWORD HANDLE THEN OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES MARCHED PRIVATE FILES BEARING THE BANNER OF OOGABOO WHICH FLUTTERED FROM A LONG POLE
THE RAINBOW'S DAUGHTER LAUGHED MERRILY AND SO INFECTIOUS WAS THIS JOYOUS LAUGH THAT BETSY ECHOED IT
THERE IS BUT ONE SLIMY CAVE AND THERE IS NO ONE IN IT RETURNED PANG POSITIVELY RUGGEDO WAS BEGINNING TO BE ALARMED AS WELL AS ANGRY HOWEVER THESE DISAPPOINTMENTS BUT MADE HIM THE MORE VINDICTIVE
BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE NOME KING TO BE HIS MASTER AND WAS READY TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS THEREFORE HE REPEATED SHAGGY'S SPEECH TO THE KING WHO AT ONCE REALIZED THAT HIS KINGDOM WAS IN GRAVE DANGER
WAS MUCH SURPRISED WHEN A ROPE SHOT OUT FROM THE DARKNESS AND TWINED AROUND HIS BODY
NO AGREED FILES THAT IS A FACT BUT IF MY OFFICERS WILL KINDLY COMMAND ME TO CONQUER YOU
BUT BEFORE THEY COULD REACH IT INVISIBLE HANDS RAISED TIK TOK FROM THE MARBLE BASIN AND SET HIM UPON HIS FEET BESIDE IT WATER DRIPPING FROM EVERY JOINT OF HIS COPPER BODY
WHILE TWO SMALLER ONES BEFORE THE NOSTRILS ALLOWED THE MAN TO BREATHE FREELY THE CLOTH WAS THEN TIGHTLY DRAWN OVER THE UGLY ONE'S FACE AND KNOTTED AT THE BACK OF HIS NECK HE WAS DRESSED IN CLOTHES THAT HAD ONCE BEEN GOOD BUT NOW WERE SADLY WORN AND FRAYED
AS HE OWNS THE LOVE MAGNET I THINK I'LL TRANSFORM HIM INTO A DOVE AND THEN WE CAN PRACTICE SHOOTING AT HIM WITH TIK TOK'S GUN
TIK TOK TACKLES A TOUGH TASK WHILE SHAGGY AND HIS COMPANIONS STOOD HUDDLED IN A GROUP AT ONE SIDE THE ARMY OF OOGABOO WAS APPROACHING ALONG THE PATHWAY THE TRAMP OF THEIR FEET BEING NOW AND THEN ACCOMPANIED BY A DISMAL GROAN
HE CAME OUT OF HIS THRONE TO STAND BEFORE THE SHAGGY MAN AND THEN HE WAVED HIS HANDS PALMS DOWNWARD IN SEVEN SEMICIRCLES OVER HIS VICTIM'S HEAD SAYING IN A LOW BUT CLEAR TONE OF VOICE THE MAGIC WUGWA
I DO NOT THINK IT IS A MOMENT TO GIVE WAY TO USELESS SORROW
NO NOISE DISTURBED THE SILENCE BUT THE OWL WHOSE PIERCING CRY SEEMED TO BE CALLING UP THE PHANTOMS OF THE NIGHT I TIED MY LANTERN TO A FORKED BRANCH I HAD NOTICED A YEAR BEFORE
IT IS WELL SIR REPLIED VILLEFORT FROM BELOW IT IS WELL HAVE PATIENCE BUT ONE DAY LONGER WHAT I HAVE SAID I WILL DO NOIRTIER SEEMED TO BE CALMED BY THESE WORDS
FOR EXCEPT MYSELF THESE ROOMS WOULD NOT HOLD A SHADOW MORE
A FEW WORDS SUFFICED FOR A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE TWO OFFICERS OF THE LAW THEY READ TO NOIRTIER THE FORMAL COPY OF A WILL
AND IN FRANCE ETERNAL FRIENDSHIPS ARE AS RARE AS THE CUSTOM OF DIVIDING BREAD AND SALT WITH ONE ANOTHER BUT SAID THE COUNTESS BREATHLESSLY WITH HER EYES FIXED ON MONTE CRISTO WHOSE ARM SHE CONVULSIVELY PRESSED WITH BOTH HANDS WE ARE FRIENDS ARE WE NOT
FROM THE REMARKS WE HAVE QUOTED FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE ANY EFFECT TO THE INTEREST HE HAD FELT AS WE HAVE SAID
BUT CONTINUED SHE LORD WILMORE HAD A FAMILY OR FRIENDS HE MUST HAVE KNOWN SOME ONE CAN WE NOT OH IT IS USELESS TO INQUIRE RETURNED THE COUNT PERHAPS AFTER ALL HE WAS NOT THE MAN YOU SEEK FOR
MY DEAR FRIEND SAID ALBERT TO BEAUCHAMP IT IS PLAIN THAT THE AFFAIRS OF SPAIN ARE SETTLED
IT WAS NOT I WHO MADE THAT PROMISE CRIED MORCERF IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ONE ELSE WHOM YOU HAVE RESCUED IN THE SAME MANNER AND WHOM YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN PRAY SPEAK OF IT FOR I SHALL NOT ONLY I TRUST RELATE THE LITTLE I DO KNOW BUT ALSO A GREAT DEAL I DO NOT KNOW
YOU SENT FOR ME HE SAID TO THE PRISONER ARE YOU SIR THE CHIEF OF THE PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT ME HERE YES YOUR EXCELLENCY WHAT THEN HOW MUCH DO YOU REQUIRE FOR MY RANSOM MERELY THE FIVE MILLION YOU HAVE ABOUT YOU
HE IS A WISE MAN ACCORDING TO HIS OWN SHOWING
AND LAFAYETTE THAT WAS A NOBLE EXAMPLE TO FOLLOW MONSIEUR
OH DO NOT GIVE ME CREDIT FOR THIS MADAME IT WAS DONE BY THE ROMANS WHO MUCH ESTEEMED THEM AND PLINY RELATES THAT THEY SENT SLAVES FROM OSTIA TO ROME WHO CARRIED ON THEIR HEADS FISH WHICH HE CALLS THE MULUS AND WHICH FROM THE DESCRIPTION MUST PROBABLY BE THE GOLDFISH
A MAGNIFICENT PEACH WAS HANGING AGAINST AN ADJOINING WALL RIPENED BY THE SAME ARTIFICIAL HEAT MERCEDES DREW NEAR AND PLUCKED THE FRUIT TAKE THIS PEACH THEN SHE SAID THE COUNT AGAIN REFUSED WHAT AGAIN
AND THE LADIES SNATCHING THEIR BOUQUETS FROM THEIR FAIR BOSOMS STREWED THE TABLE WITH THEIR FLORAL TREASURES IN A WORD AN ALMOST POETICAL FERVOR PREVAILED AH SAID THE MARQUISE DE SAINT MERAN
MADAME DE VILLEFORT WHO WAS IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS WOULD NEITHER BELIEVE NOR THINK OF THE MISFORTUNE BUT MADEMOISELLE VALENTINE AT THE FIRST WORDS GUESSED THE WHOLE TRUTH NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE PRECAUTIONS OF HER FATHER THE BLOW STRUCK HER LIKE A THUNDERBOLT AND SHE FELL SENSELESS
CONSIDER BY BECOMING A GARDENER I EFFECTUALLY SCREEN OUR MEETINGS FROM ALL SUSPICION OR DANGER I BESEECH OF YOU MAXIMILIAN TO CEASE TRIFLING AND TELL ME WHAT YOU REALLY MEAN SIMPLY
AND THAT EXPLAINS HOW IT COMES TO PASS THAT FALLEN AS I TRUST HE IS FOREVER NAPOLEON HAS STILL RETAINED A TRAIN OF PARASITICAL SATELLITES
BUT FOR YOU IN THE WORDS OF THE GOSPEL SEEK AND YOU SHALL FIND I HAVE FOUND ALREADY WHAT I WOULD STAB THE MAN BUT THE WOMAN TOLD ME THAT IF ANY MISFORTUNE HAPPENED TO HER BETROTHED SHE WOULD KILL HERSELF
THIRTEEN HUNDRED THERE YOU ARE KELLY SAID ANTHONY TEARING OFF A CHECK
WINSOME WAITRESS WINS WEALTHY WISCONSIN WOODSMAN FOR A WHILE WE FELT THAT MILLY WAS ON THE VERGE OF BEING LOST TO US IT WAS OUR LOVE OF THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE THAT INSPIRED US WE COULD NOT GIVE HER OVER TO A LUMBERMAN DOUBLY ACCURSED BY WEALTH AND PROVINCIALISM
TO PAUSE IN A SORT OF INVOLUNTARY ARMISTICE
PRINCE MICHAEL SAT ON HIS FAVOURITE BENCH AND SMILED IT WAS A DIVERTING THOUGHT TO HIM THAT HE WAS WEALTHY ENOUGH TO BUY EVERY ONE OF THOSE CLOSE RANGED BULKY WINDOW LIT MANSIONS THAT FACED HIM IF HE CHOSE
SHE WILL GROW FAT ASKED JUDKINS FEARSOMELY SHE WILL GO TO NIGHT SCHOOL AND BECOME REFINED I VENTURED ANXIOUSLY IT IS THIS SAID KRAFT PUNCTUATING IN A PUDDLE OF SPILLED COFFEE WITH A STIFF FOREFINGER
HER VOICE RANG LIKE A GREAT SILVER BELL HER SMILE WAS MANY TOOTHED AND FREQUENT SHE SEEMED LIKE A YELLOW SUNRISE ON MOUNTAIN TOPS I NEVER SAW HER BUT I THOUGHT OF THE YOSEMITE
AND ONE MAY STAND ON A CHAIR AND DIG AT IT IN VAIN UNTIL ONE'S FINGERS ARE PINK AND BRUISED A HAIRPIN WILL NOT REMOVE IT THEREFORE LET US CALL IT IMMOVABLE SO DULCIE LIT THE GAS
PIGGY'S AN AWFUL SWELL AND HE ALWAYS TAKES A GIRL TO SWELL PLACES HE TOOK BLANCHE UP TO THE HOFFMAN HOUSE ONE EVENING
THE MAY MOON SHONE BRIGHT UPON THE PRIVATE BOARDING HOUSE OF MISSUS MURPHY BY REFERENCE TO THE ALMANAC A LARGE AMOUNT OF TERRITORY WILL BE DISCOVERED UPON WHICH ITS RAYS ALSO FELL
WE WENT IN CALLED FOR FOOD AND ATE IT WE PAID OR WE DID NOT PAY WE HAD CONFIDENCE IN CYPHER'S SULLENNESS AND SMOULDERING FEROCITY DEEP DOWN IN HIS SUNLESS SOUL HE WAS EITHER A PRINCE A FOOL OR AN ARTIST
BUT OH MISTER TOOMEY YOU ARE SO DASHING SO RECKLESS SUPPOSE IN YOUR ENTHUSIASM SOME ACCIDENT SHOULD BEFALL YOU THEN WHAT OLD MAN DENNY READ ON ABOUT THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WITH ONE FINGER ON THE LINES
CAME TO SIX CENTS AND TWO SUNDAY PAPERS ONE FOR THE PERSONAL COLUMN AND THE OTHER TO READ WERE TEN CENTS
TWILL NOT LAST LONG SURE THEY'LL HAVE TO BORROW MORE DISHES TO KEEP IT UP WITH AND JUST THEN CAME THE LOUD SCREAM BELOW STAIRS BETOKENING FEAR OR DIRE EXTREMITY TIS PROBABLY THE CAT SAID POLICEMAN CLEARY AND WALKED HASTILY IN THE OTHER DIRECTION
THE BATTLE ACCORDING TO COURSES SHOULD HAVE ENDED
AN UNFINISHED STORY WE NO LONGER GROAN AND HEAP ASHES UPON OUR HEADS WHEN THE FLAMES OF TOPHET ARE MENTIONED FOR EVEN THE PREACHERS HAVE BEGUN TO TELL US THAT GOD IS RADIUM OR ETHER OR SOME SCIENTIFIC COMPOUND
CAESAR HAD HIS BRUTUS THE COTTON HAS ITS BOLLWORM THE CHORUS GIRL HAS HER PITTSBURGER THE SUMMER BOARDER HAS HIS POISON IVY THE HERO HAS HIS CARNEGIE MEDAL ART HAS ITS MORGAN THE ROSE HAS ITS SPEAK I INTERRUPTED MUCH PERTURBED
SHE WORE NO CHAINS BRACELETS OR LOCKETS SHE HAD NOT THE AIR OF BEING ABOUT TO ACCEPT AN INVITATION TO LUNCHEON HER DRESS WAS GREY AND PLAIN BUT IT FITTED HER FIGURE WITH FIDELITY AND DISCRETION
FACE DOWNWARD WITH A SEVERE GESTURE
SHE WAS REASSURED QUICKLY ENOUGH BY HER SENSE OF HIS GREAT GOOD MANNERS
SHE WAS LEARNING TO SACRIFICE CONSISTENCY TO CONSIDERATIONS OF THAT INFERIOR ORDER FOR WHICH THE EXCUSE MUST BE FOUND IN THE PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS NOT TO THE CREDIT OF HER ABSOLUTE RECTITUDE
SHE HAD HEARD THE SOUND BEFORE AND SHE RECOGNISED IT
AS TO WHOM THE PROPOSAL OF AN OWNERSHIP DIVIDED WITH HER COUSIN HAD BEEN APPLIED AS IMPARTIALLY AS POSSIBLE AS IMPARTIALLY AS BUNCHIE'S OWN SOMEWHAT FICKLE AND INCONSTANT SYMPATHIES WOULD ALLOW
ISABEL'S ORIGINALITY WAS THAT SHE GAVE ONE AN IMPRESSION OF HAVING INTENTIONS OF HER OWN WHENEVER SHE EXECUTES THEM SAID RALPH MAY I BE THERE TO SEE IT DEVOLVED UPON HIM OF COURSE TO DO THE HONOURS OF THE PLACE
SHE WAS ABSORBED IN THE ALARM GIVEN HER BY HENRIETTA'S INTIMATION THAT CASPAR GOODWOOD WOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT GARDENCOURT SHE PRETENDED TO HERSELF HOWEVER THAT SHE THOUGHT THE EVENT IMPOSSIBLE AND LATER
A REAL LITTLE PASSIONATE FORCE TO SEE AT PLAY IS THE FINEST THING IN NATURE IT'S FINER THAN THE FINEST WORK OF ART THAN A GREEK BAS RELIEF
IN WHICH THE DIFFICULTY OF DOING AS ONE LIKED APPEARED TO INCREASE AS ONE GREW OLDER HAD BEEN SENSIBLY MODIFIED BY THE PAIN OF SEPARATION FROM HIS CLEVER HIS SUPERIOR HIS REMARKABLE GIRL LATER WHEN THE JOURNEYS TO EUROPE CEASED
WHICH HE SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO DISCREDIT SO FAR AS HE MIGHT BY DYING FIRST BUT OF THE TWO TRIUMPHS THAT OF REFUTING A SOPHISTICAL SON AND THAT OF HOLDING ON A WHILE LONGER TO A STATE OF BEING WHICH WITH ALL ABATEMENTS HE ENJOYED
SAID ISABEL BECAUSE I'M SURE HE'S NICE
AND AT IMPORTANT MOMENTS WHEN SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN THANKFUL TO MAKE USE OF HER JUDGEMENT ALONE SHE PAID THE PENALTY OF HAVING GIVEN UNDUE ENCOURAGEMENT
WHILE I TALKED I NEVER SAW AN UGLY MAN LOOK SO HANDSOME HE'S VERY SIMPLE MINDED SAID ISABEL AND HE'S NOT SO UGLY THERE'S NOTHING SO SIMPLIFYING AS A GRAND PASSION
OF LAUGHING AT ALL THINGS BEGINNING WITH HIMSELF SUCH SLENDER FACULTY OF REVERENCE AS HE POSSESSED CENTRED WHOLLY UPON HIS FATHER FOR THE REST HE EXERCISED HIS WIT INDIFFERENTLY UPON HIS FATHER'S SON THIS GENTLEMAN'S WEAK LUNGS
A PASTIME FOR WHICH THE WEATHER REMAINED FAVOURABLE WITH A PERSISTENCY NOT ALLOWED FOR IN ISABEL'S SOMEWHAT LUGUBRIOUS PREVISION OF THE CLIMATE AND IN THE LONG AFTERNOONS OF WHICH THE LENGTH WAS BUT THE MEASURE OF HER GRATIFIED EAGERNESS
GROWN USED TO FEELING RICH THE CONSCIOUSNESS IN QUESTION FOUND A PROPER PLACE IN RATHER A DENSE LITTLE GROUP OF IDEAS THAT SHE HAD ABOUT HERSELF AND OFTEN IT WAS BY NO MEANS THE LEAST AGREEABLE
SHE WOULD BE AS AMERICAN AS IT PLEASED HIM TO REGARD HER AND IF HE CHOSE TO LAUGH AT HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM PLENTY OF OCCUPATION SHE DEFENDED ENGLAND AGAINST HIS MOTHER BUT WHEN RALPH SANG ITS PRAISES ON PURPOSE AS SHE SAID TO WORK HER UP
WELL NOW THERE'S A SPECIMEN HE SAID TO HER AS THEY WALKED UP FROM THE RIVERSIDE AND HE RECOGNISED LORD WARBURTON A SPECIMEN OF WHAT ASKED THE GIRL A SPECIMEN OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN DO YOU MEAN THEY'RE ALL LIKE HIM
DO YOU THINK HE WOULD STAND THE TEST THE TEST I
POOR RALPH HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS STEEPED IN MELANCHOLY HIS OUTLOOK HABITUALLY SOMBRE LAY UNDER THE SHADOW OF A DEEPER CLOUD
AND THE THATCH OF BRANCHES OF TREES THE FIRE WAS IN THE CENTRE AND FILLED THE WHOLE WIGWAM WITH SMOKE WHICH ESCAPED AS MUCH THROUGH THE DOOR AS BY MEANS OF A CIRCULAR APERTURE IN THE ROOF AN OLD HIGHLAND SIBYL THE ONLY INHABITANT OF THIS FORLORN MANSION
IN VIRTUE OF THE DATE OF MY PATENT AS PRIOR TO THEIR SILLY CLAIMS I ASSURE YOU I WOULD HAVE HAD SUCH A CONSENT FROM THEM IF IT HAD BEEN AT THE POINT OF THE SWORD AND THEN OUT COMES THE REAL TRUTH AND HE DARES TO TELL ME TO MY FACE
WHICH TAKES ROOT WITHIN THE PLACE BESIEGED OR IT MAY BE OF THE HERB WOODBIND PARIETARIA OR PELLITORY WE SHALL NOT I SAY GAIN IT BY THIS SAME BLOCKADE OR LEAGUER OF EDINBURGH CASTLE
PARTICULARLY HIS BRAVERY AND GENEROSITY AT PRESTON UNTIL WARMED AT THE IDEA OF THEIR NEPHEW'S ENGAGING IN SINGLE COMBAT MAKING PRISONER AND SAVING FROM SLAUGHTER SO DISTINGUISHED AN OFFICER AS THE COLONEL HIMSELF THE IMAGINATION OF THE BARONET AND HIS SISTER
NO GREAT DIFFICULTY TO THE ACTIVE MOUNTAINEER WHO WAS PERFECTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE GROUND AND TRACED HIS COURSE WITH A FIRMNESS AND CONFIDENCE TO WHICH HIS PURSUERS MUST HAVE BEEN STRANGERS THE ALARM WHICH HE EXCITED SEEMED STILL TO CONTINUE
HE LOOKED ROUND IT WAS ALICE THE DAUGHTER OF DONALD BEAN LEAN SHE SHOWED HIM A PACKET OF PAPERS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE MOTION WAS REMARKED BY NO ONE ELSE
WHEN BEHOLD THE PEDLAR SNATCHING A MUSKET FROM THE PERSON WHO WAS NEXT HIM BESTOWED THE BUTT OF IT WITH SUCH EMPHASIS ON THE HEAD OF HIS LATE INSTRUCTOR
SO THAT HE FAIRLY GAVE US THE SLIP AND MARCHED NORTHWARD TO ABERDEEN LEAVING THE LOW COUNTRY OPEN AND UNDEFENDED NOT TO LOSE SO FAVOURABLE AN OPPORTUNITY I MARCHED ON TO THIS METROPOLIS DRIVING BEFORE ME TWO REGIMENTS OF HORSE
THUS SAYING HE EXTENDED HIS HAND TO EDWARD WITH THE UTMOST COURTESY WHO COULD NOT HAD HE DESIRED IT HAVE AVOIDED RENDERING HIM THE HOMAGE WHICH SEEMED DUE TO HIS RANK AND WAS CERTAINLY THE RIGHT OF HIS BIRTH I AM SORRY TO UNDERSTAND MISTER WAVERLEY THAT
DISTRICT OF MOIDART WITH ONLY SEVEN ATTENDANTS AND OF THE NUMEROUS CHIEFS AND CLANS WHOSE LOYAL ENTHUSIASM AT ONCE PLACED A SOLITARY ADVENTURER AT THE HEAD OF A GALLANT ARMY YOU MUST ALSO I THINK HAVE LEARNED THAT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE HANOVERIAN ELECTOR
IN THIS CITY AT LEAST ANSWERED HIS FRIEND
NOT TO PRESS MY JUST AND REASONABLE REQUEST AT THIS MOMENT AFTER THIS PUT YOUR FAITH IN PRINCES AND DID YOUR AUDIENCE END HERE END O NO I WAS DETERMINED TO LEAVE HIM NO PRETENCE FOR HIS INGRATITUDE
FOR I AM AT THIS MOMENT TEMPTED TO CURSE MY OWN WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT I MADE THIS VERY MORNING TWO SUITS TO THE PRINCE AND HE HAS REJECTED THEM BOTH WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT WHAT CAN I THINK ANSWERED WAVERLEY TILL I KNOW WHAT YOUR REQUESTS WERE
AND PASSED ON AS IF TO ASSIST OLD JANET IN PACKING WAVERLEY'S CLOTHES IN HIS PORTMANTEAU IT WAS OBVIOUSLY HER WISH THAT HE SHOULD NOT SEEM TO RECOGNISE HER YET SHE REPEATEDLY LOOKED BACK AT HIM AS AN OPPORTUNITY OCCURRED OF DOING SO UNOBSERVED
AND INDEMNITIES AND OATHS AND BONDS AND OTHER CORRUPTIONS
WERE NEAR THE TOP OF THE ASCENT AND THE REMAINDER STRAGGLED AFTER THEM AT A CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL SUCH WAS THE SITUATION OF MATTERS WHEN THE PEDLAR MISSING AS HE SAID A LITTLE DOGGIE WHICH BELONGED TO HIM
AS I THINK IT NECESSARY TO HAVE FOR THE FUTURE MISTRESS OF MY FAMILY AND THE MOTHER OF MY CHILDREN SHE IS A VERY PRETTY INTELLIGENT GIRL AND IS CERTAINLY OF ONE OF THE VERY FIRST LOWLAND FAMILIES AND WITH A LITTLE OF FLORA'S INSTRUCTIONS AND FORMING
FOR SERVICES THEN RENDERED AND CERTAINLY MY MERIT HAS NOT BEEN DIMINISHED TO SAY THE LEAST BY MY SUBSEQUENT BEHAVIOUR NOW SIR I VALUE THIS BAUBLE OF A CORONET AS LITTLE AS YOU CAN OR ANY PHILOSOPHER ON EARTH
OH IT WAS WONDERFUL AN THERE
BUT THE NEXT MORNING AFTER SHE HAD GIVEN KEITH HIS BREAKFAST NOT OF TOAST AND OATMEAL SHE SUGGESTED BLITHELY THAT HE GET UP AND BE DRESSED WHEN HE REFUSED SHE TRIED COAXING MILDLY THEN MORE STRENUOUSLY
THE BOY HIS FACE TO THE WALL LAY MOTIONLESS BUT HE WAS NOT ASLEEP SUSAN KNEW THAT FOR SHE HAD HEARD HIS VOICE NOT FIVE MINUTES BEFORE BIDDING THE NURSE GOOD BYE FOR ONE BRIEF MOMENT SUSAN HESITATED THEN BRISKLY SHE STEPPED INTO THE ROOM WITH A CHEERY
AN DO YOU NOW RUN BACK TO THE SETTIN' ROOM I'VE GOT MY DINNER TO GET KEITH HAD NOT DISAPPEARED DOWN THE HALL HOWEVER BEFORE SUSAN WAS HALFWAY UP THE BACK STAIRS A MOMENT LATER SHE WAS IN THE STUDIO DANIEL BURTON
I ACTED AS IF ANYTHING WAS THE MATTER STAMMERED THE YOUTH WELL YOU DO NOW TELL ME WHAT IS IT NOTHING NOTHING SUSAN NOTHING YOU CAN HELP KEITH WAS PACING BACK AND FORTH AND UP AND DOWN THE LIVING ROOM
ONLY A FAINT SHAKE OF THE HEAD ANSWERED HER THE DOCTOR SAYS YOU'RE LOTS BETTER KEITH THERE WAS NO SORT OF REPLY TO THIS AND FOR ANOTHER LONG MINUTE SUSAN SAT TENSE AND MOTIONLESS WATCHING THE BOY'S FACE
INTERRUPTED THE MAN IRRITABLY KEITH IS ALL RIGHT THAT IS HE IS JUST AS HE HAS BEEN IT'S MY SISTER MISSUS COLEBROOK SHE'S GONE GONE FOR GOOD
NO YOU DON'T RAKE ME INTO THIS THING YOUNG LADY AS PLAINLY AS IF SHE HAD SPOKEN THE WORDS THEMSELVES IN THE LIVING ROOM A MINUTE LATER KEITH BEGAN EAGER QUESTIONING WHEN DID YOU COME YESTERDAY AND YOU CAME TO SEE ME
BUT HE'S REAL BRAVE CHALLENGED THE GIRL QUICKLY MAZIE SAID HE WAS I KNOW EVERYBODY SAYS HE'S BRAVE THERE WAS AN ODD CONSTRAINT IN SUSAN'S VOICE BUT THE GIRL WAS TOO INTENT ON HER OWN PROBLEM TO NOTICE IT AND THAT'S WHY I HOPED
THEY LIKE THE DARK THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE FOR THEN THEY CAN BE GREAT THEY LOOM LIKE DOOM FROM OUT THE GLOOM AN SHRIEK I AM YOUR FATE BUT AFTER ALL THEM THINGS THAT PLAGUE ARE COWARDS SAY NOT YOU
HE HAD ALREADY SAT UP IN A CHAIR EVERY DAY FOR A WEEK AND HE WAS IN NO FURTHER NEED OF MEDICINE EXCEPT A TONIC TO BUILD HIM UP IN FACT ALL EFFORTS NOW SHOULD BE TURNED TOWARD BUILDING HIM UP THE DOCTOR SAID THAT WAS WHAT HE NEEDED
OH YES HE SAID A GREAT DEAL BUT IT WAS ONLY A REPETITION OF WHAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE IN THE LETTER DANIEL BURTON SPOKE WEARILY CONSTRAINEDLY HIS FACE HAD GROWN A LITTLE WHITE THE DOCTOR BOUGHT
HIS FACE WAS ALIGHT ALMOST EAGER I DID IT I DID IT SUSAN AND IF IT HASN'T BEEN MORE THAN TWENTY MINUTES I DID IT SOONER THAN YOU SUSAN TRIED TO SPEAK BUT THE TEARS WERE AGAIN CHASING EACH OTHER DOWN HER CHEEKS
I DON'T SAY THIS SORT OF THING VERY OFTEN I NEVER SAID IT BEFORE TO ANYBODY BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED JUST WHAT YOU WERE DOING ALL THOSE WEEKS FOR ME OUT THERE AT THE SANATORIUM
THAT DONE SHE COPIED THE LETTER WORD FOR WORD EXCEPT FOR THE TITLE OF THE POEM SUBMITTED IT WAS A LONG LETTER SUSAN TOLD FIRST OF KEITH AND HIS MISFORTUNE AND THE IMPERATIVE NEED OF MONEY FOR THE OPERATION
SEND THEM IF YOU WANT TO BUT DON'T BLAME ME FOR THE CONSEQUENCES AND WITH A GESTURE AS OF FLINGING THE WHOLE THING FAR FROM HIM HE TURNED HIS BACK AND WALKED AWAY YOU MEAN
ALL THIS THE NURSE MENTIONED TO MISTER BURTON AND TO SUSAN AS SHE WAS LEAVING SHE WENT AWAY AT TWO O'CLOCK AND MISSUS COLEBROOK WAS NOT TO COME UNTIL HALF PAST FIVE AT ONE MINUTE PAST TWO SUSAN CREPT TO THE DOOR OF KEITH'S ROOM AND PUSHED IT OPEN SOFTLY
SO SHORTLY THAT MISSUS MC GUIRE OPENED HER EYES A BIT AND WONDERED WHY SUSAN'S LIPS HAD SNAPPED TIGHT SHUT IN THAT STRAIGHT HARD LINE BUT WHAT AILS THE WOMAN SHE MUTTERED TO HERSELF VEXEDLY AS SHE CROSSED THE BACK YARD TO HER OWN DOOR
OH GRANDPAPA I'D RATHER STAY HERE IT IS BEAUTIFUL ISN'T IT ECHOED OLD MISTER KING FEELING TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER SINCE HE STARTED ON HIS TRAVELS WELL WELL CHILD I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT LOOKING DOWN INTO HER BEAMING LITTLE FACE

TO MORROW NOW WE'LL DROP IN AGAIN AND LOOK AT SOME OF THE PICTURES THERE IS BEAUTY ENOUGH IN THAT STATUE SAID A LADY WHO JUST PASSED THEM TO THE GENTLEMAN WITH HER TO SATISFY ANY ONE
AND HE WAS CRUELLY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T COME DOWN TO VISIT HIM IN HIS HOME WE COULDN'T SAID MOTHER FISHER IN A SORRY VOICE AT SEEING THE OTHER FACE I UNDERSTAND QUITE SAID TOM'S MOTHER WITH A GENTLE PRESSURE OF THE HAND SHE HELD
OTHERWISE WE SHALL ATTRACT ATTENTION TO BE STANDING HERE AND GAZING AT THEM AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT LITTLE BEAUTY AGAIN REMARKED EDWARD I'LL CONFESS EVELYN SO EVELYN AND EDWARD
AND HAS IT A LITTLE WHITE TENT ON THE SIDE JUST LIKE MY MOUNTAIN HERE ASKED PHRONSIE HOLDING POLLY'S ARM AS SHE TURNED OFF TO CATCH THE CHATTER OF THE OTHERS OH I SUPPOSE SO ANSWERED POLLY CARELESSLY
IN THAT CASE MISSUS FISHER OLD MISTER KING LOOKED DOWN THE TABLE LENGTH TO MAMSIE WE MUST GO TOO FOR I DON'T INTEND TO LOSE SIGHT OF THESE NICE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS UNTIL I AM OBLIGED TO TOM'S FACE WAS ONE BIG SMILE
ONE MORE LEAP WITH ALL HIS MIGHT AND I HAVE YOU CRIED TOM THE MAN UNDER HIM THROWN TO THE GROUND BY THE SUDDENNESS OF TOM'S LEAP ON HIM WAS WRIGGLING AND SQUIRMING WITH ALL THE DESPERATION OF A TRAPPED CREATURE
OR ANY OF OUR HOME FRIENDS IT'S MISSUS SELWYN SHE HAD CONFIDED TO THE LITTLE DOCTOR JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE SHE HASN'T ANY NONSENSE ABOUT HER IF SHE IS AN EARL'S DAUGHTER EARL'S DAUGHTER SNIFFED THE LITTLE DOCTOR
THIS IS MY SEAT I ONLY LEFT IT TO SPEAK TO MY FATHER BUT THE FRENCHMAN BEING THERE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD GET STILL FURTHER INTO THE SEAT SO HE TWISTED AND EDGED BUT JASPER SLIPPED NEATLY IN AND LOOKED CALMLY UP AT HIM
AND THEN HE SAW ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN THE PERSON OF THE PARSON WHO WAS JUST AS BIG AS THE DOCTOR WAS SMALL WITH ONE LOOK HE GLANCED AROUND TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY MORE SUCH SPECIMENS AT ANY RATE IT WAS TIME TO BE GOING
AND THAT WAS ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FEET LOWER OH GRANDPAPA EXCLAIMED PHRONSIE IN GENTLE SURPRISE UNABLE TO COMPASS SUCH FIGURES MISTER KING'S PARTY HAD MADE ONE OR TWO PLEASANT LITTLE JOURNEYS TO THE LAUTERBRUNNEN VALLEY STAYING THERE AND AT MUERREN
SO SHE WAS JUST GOING TO GET UP FROM HER LOG WHEN THE GIRLS THINKING FROM HER ATTITUDE THAT SHE HAD GIVEN UP THE IDEA OF TAKING A PICTURE OF THEM TURNED BACK TO THEIR WORK AS QUICK AS A FLASH POLLY FOCUSSED AGAIN AND WAS JUST TOUCHING THE BUTTON
AND PHRONSIE WAS CONTENT TO PASS HOUR AFTER HOUR THERE BY GRANDPAPA'S SIDE AND IMAGINE ALL SORTS OF PRETTY PICTURES AND STORIES IN AND ABOUT THE SNOW CLAD HEIGHTS OF THE MAJESTIC MOUNTAIN AND THE THRONG OF GAILY DRESSED PEOPLE SOJOURNING IN THE BIG HOTELS
O DEAR ME CRIED ADELA IN DISMAY AND I THINK WE SHALL SLIP AND SLIDE A GREAT DEAL WORSE WITH THOSE THINGS TIED ON OUR FEET THAN TO GO WITHOUT ANY SAID POLLY WRINKLING UP HER BROWS AT THE IDEA
THERE ARE MY FATHER AND MY TWO DAUGHTERS AND MY OTHER BOYS IN ENGLAND
AND FORMED A DUTCH PERSPECTIVE PERFECTLY AWFUL ALL THESE QUEER DELIGHTFUL THINGS WERE PRESENTLY IMPRISONED IN THE TWO KODAKS JASPER LOOKED UP THERE THAT'S MY LAST PICTURE HE DECLARED AT ANY RATE FOR NOW
IS A VOLUME THAT COULD DO NO POSSIBLE HARM TO ANY ONE THESE POEMS DISPLAY A HEALTHY ROLLICKING G R SIMS TONE OF FEELING AN ALMOST UNBOUNDED REGARD FOR THE CONVERTED DRUNKARD
HAS NO ABIDING PLACE HIS OWN TO CALL IT IS A CURIOUS FACT THAT THE WORST WORK IS ALWAYS DONE WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS AND THAT PEOPLE ARE NEVER SO TRIVIAL AS WHEN THEY TAKE THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY
THESE HOWEVER ARE MINOR POINTS MISTER SYMONDS IS TO BE WARMLY CONGRATULATED ON THE COMPLETION OF HIS HISTORY OF THE RENAISSANCE IN ITALY IT IS A MOST WONDERFUL MONUMENT OF LITERARY LABOUR AND ITS VALUE TO THE STUDENT OF HUMANISM CANNOT BE DOUBTED
I LAY DOWN MY LIFE'S TREASURE MY PRIDE MY GARMENTS AND MY NAME WITH MEN THE WORLD AND I HENCEFORTH SHALL BE AS TWAIN
WOULD HAVE MADE OUT OF THE PRESTIGE OF ENGLAND FOR INSTANCE A POEM SUGGESTED BY THE OPENING OF THE ZULU WAR IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY NINE NOW AWAY SAIL OUR SHIPS FAR AWAY O'ER THE SEA
I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT MISS RAMSAY'S BRILLIANT SUCCESS AT CAMBRIDGE IS NOT DESTINED TO REMAIN AN ISOLATED INSTANCE OF WHAT WOMEN CAN DO IN INTELLECTUAL COMPETITIONS WITH MEN AT THE ROYAL UNIVERSITY IN IRELAND
AND IS AS DEPRESSING AS IT IS DETESTABLE HOWEVER AS THE COWL DOES NOT MAKE THE MONK SO THE BINDING IN THE CASE OF THE SAVILE CLUB SCHOOL DOES NOT MAKE THE POET AND WE OPEN THE VOLUME WITHOUT PREJUDICE
IS AWKWARD AND UNCOUTH AND YET THE POEM IN WHICH THE EXPRESSION OCCURS HAS SOME PRETTY LINES MISTER IAN HAMILTON SHOULD PRUNE PRUNING WHETHER IN THE GARDEN OR IN THE STUDY
AND CAVALIERE'S RAPPRESENTAZIONE PRECEDED IT BY SOME YEARS AND IT IS SOMEWHAT EXAGGERATED TO SAY THAT UNDER THE REGIME OF THE COMMONWEALTH THE NATIONAL GROWTH OF ENGLISH MUSIC RECEIVED A CHECK FROM WHICH IT NEVER AFTERWARDS RECOVERED AS IT WAS WITH CROMWELL'S AUSPICES
THE PRETTIEST THING IN THE WHOLE VOLUME IS THIS LITTLE LYRIC ON SPRING SUCH BLUE OF SKY SO PALELY FAIR SUCH GLOW OF EARTH SUCH LUCID AIR SUCH PURPLE ON THE MOUNTAIN LINES SUCH DEEP NEW VERDURE IN THE PINES
POEMS IN THE MODERN SPIRIT WITH THE SECRET OF CONTENT
THIS NOTE OF REALISM IN DEALING WITH NATIONAL TYPES OF CHARACTER HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC OF IRISH FICTION FROM THE DAYS OF MISS EDGEWORTH DOWN TO OUR OWN DAYS
A HUMBLE SOLDIER IN THE ARMY OF FAITH EXPRESSES A HOPE THAT HIS BOOK MAY INVIGORATE DEVOTIONAL FEELING ESPECIALLY AMONG THE YOUNG TO WHOM VERSE IS PERHAPS MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN TO THEIR ELDERS
A HIDEOUS IDOL WHOSE FACE WAS BLACKENED WITH SOOT FROM BURNING HUMAN FLESH SUCH A SENTENCE ALSO AS
THE CONTINUAL USE OF PERIPHRASES IS UNDOUBTEDLY A GRAVE FAULT IN STYLE YET WHO BUT A PEDANT WOULD REALLY QUARREL WITH SUCH PERIPHRASES AS
AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BE AT ONCE DIDACTIC AND DELIGHTFUL BUT LADY BELLAIRS MANAGES VERY CLEVERLY TO STEER A MIDDLE COURSE BETWEEN THE CHARYBDIS OF DULNESS AND THE SCYLLA OF FLIPPANCY
THE YOUNG MEN WHO GO OUT AT NIGHT TO BE DRILLED BY AN IRISH AMERICAN THE FARMERS WITH THEIR WILD LAND HUNGER BIDDING SECRETLY AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR EVERY VACANT FIELD THE DISPENSARY DOCTOR WHO IS ALWAYS REGRETTING THAT HE HAS NOT GOT A TRINITY COLLEGE DEGREE
ONLY ALAS HE IS NOT THE LOVER OF MY DREAMS MY CHILDREN ARE NICE HANDSOME BOYS
AND SOMEBODY WILL GO RIGHT HOME WITH YOU TO SEE YOUR MOTHER TO WARM YOU YOU POOR LITTLE MITE AND FEED YOU AND MAKE YOU QUITE HAPPY SHE DID NOT EXPLAIN AND THE CHILD WOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD
BUT IT DID NOT MAKE HER ANY THE LESS NERVOUS OR HER VOICE ANY THE LESS SHAKY AS SHE BEGAN IT WAS AFTER DINNER ON ONE OF THOSE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN THEY DINED ALONE TOGETHER THEY WERE TAKING COFFEE IN MISSUS SHATTUCK'S ESPECIAL CORNER OF THE DRAWING ROOM
HAD RINGS ROUND HER EYES WHICH TOLD OF SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AND WHY WE WERE MERE SPECTATORS WE HAD BEEN INTERESTED TO DISPUTE AND LOOK ON BUT SHE KNEW THAT SOMEWHERE OUT THERE IN THE NORTHEAST HER MAN WAS CARRYING A GUN
I SUPPOSE YOU THINK ME THE MOST UNGRATEFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD I KNOW ONLY TOO WELL THAT TO MANY WOMEN MY POSITION HAS ALWAYS APPEARED ENVIABLE POOR
I LOOKED BACK AT MY MARRIAGE AND SAW THE AFFAIR AS IT REALLY WAS I HAD NOT SOLD MYSELF TO YOU EXACTLY I HAD LOVED YOU TOO MUCH TO BARGAIN IN THAT WAY NEVERTHELESS THE MARRIAGE HAD BEEN A BARGAIN IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR PROMISE TO PROTECT AND PROVIDE FOR ME TO FEED ME CLOTHE ME
WATCHING THE WHITE SAILS AS THE YACHTS MADE FOR MARBLEHEAD HARBOR AND THE LONG LINE OF SURF BEATING AGAINST THE RUGGED ROCKS BEYOND THE WIDE PEBBLY BEACH ON WHICH THE DRAGGING STONES MADE WEIRD MUSIC
THAT SHE VOUCHED FOR A SPECIAL DONATION FOR THE CASE AS A SORT OF COMMEMORATIVE GIFT THE SUM WAS LARGE IT WAS A QUIXOTIC SORT OF SALVE TO A SICK CONSCIENCE WHICH TOLD HER THAT SHE OUGHT TO GO HERSELF THE CHILD STILL SOBBING TURNED AWAY
MISSUS SHATTUCK EXAMINED HER DAINTILY POLISHED NAILS RUBBED THEM CAREFULLY ON THE PALM OF HER HAND AS WOMEN HAVE A TRICK OF DOING
CERTAINLY ONE OF YOUR BEASTLY HEAD ACHES SHE UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU
BUT SHE HAD FELT IT ABSURD ALWAYS TO GO ABOUT THIS KIND OF WORK IN A PRIVATE CARRIAGE AND TO DAY SHE COULD NOT AS SHE USUALLY DID TAKE A STREET CAR FOR FEAR OF MEETING FRIENDS THEY THOUGHT HER QUEER ENOUGH AS IT WAS
I HAVE HAD MY DAY FOR YEARS IT WAS AN ENVIABLE ONE NO WOMAN CAN HOPE FOR MORE WHAT RIGHT HAVE I TO STAND IN THE WAY OF ANOTHER WOMAN'S HAPPINESS A HAPPINESS NO ONE CAN VALUE BETTER THAN I WHO SO LONG WORE IT IN SECURITY
AT WHICH NATURE LAUGHS YET THIS OTHER WOMAN PROUD HIGH MINDED UNSELFISH HITHERTO ABOVE REPROACH HAD GIVEN HERSELF FOR LOVE ALONE WITH EVERYTHING TO LOSE AND NOTHING TO GAIN I HAVE COME TO DOUBT MYSELF
THE LAWYER IS A REALIST SAID THE SCULPTOR OF COURSE THAT APPEALS TO HIM IF YOU WANT MY OPINION I CONSIDER THAT THERE IS JUST AS MUCH IMAGINATION IN THAT STORY
OLD SCEPTICS AND MODERN SCOFFERS I REMEMBER IT WELL BEFORE I WAS OUT OF MY TEENS I HAD IMBIBED A MISTRUST FOR ALL EMOTIONS PERHAPS YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ALL ON THE OUTSIDE THAT I HAD NONE
I'M NOT AN AUTHOR AND I AM GOING TO BED
I WAS A WOMAN THAT OTHER MEN LIKED AND THEREFORE A DESIRABLE WOMAN I WAS OF GOOD FAMILY ALTOGETHER YOUR SOCIAL EQUAL IN FACT QUITE THE SORT OF WOMAN IT BECAME YOU TO MARRY I PLEASED YOU AND I LOVED YOU
OF COURSE MY HUSBAND IS A GOOD MAN IN ALL WAYS I DO HIM PERFECT JUSTICE
WHICH MIGHT OBLIGE THE PARLIAMENT TO ACCEPT OF REASONABLE CONDITIONS AND RESTORE PEACE TO THE NATION THE CHARMS OF HIS CONVERSATION JOINED TO HIS CHARACTER OF COURAGE AND INTEGRITY HAD PROCURED HIM THE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE OF NORTHUMBERLAND CONWAY
THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED PROVINCES WERE MUCH ATTACHED TO HIS INTERESTS BESIDES HIS CONNECTION WITH THE FAMILY OF ORANGE WHICH WAS EXTREMELY BELOVED BY THE POPULACE ALL MEN REGARDED WITH COMPASSION HIS HELPLESS CONDITION
AND APPOINTED AN ARMY TO BE LEVIED UNDER HIS COMMAND BUT ABOVE ALL THEY WERE INTENT THAT ESSEX'S ARMY ON WHICH THEIR WHOLE FORTUNE DEPENDED SHOULD BE PUT IN A CONDITION OF MARCHING AGAINST THE KING
WERE ENRAGED TO FIND THAT BY THE TREACHERY OR SUPERIOR CUNNING OF THEN ASSOCIATES THE FRUITS OF ALL THEIR SUCCESSFUL LABORS WERE RAVISHED FROM THEM THE FORMER PARTY FROM INCLINATION AND PRINCIPLE
THERE WERE MANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH STRONGLY INVITED THE NATIVES OF IRELAND TO EMBRACE THE KING'S PARTY
TERRIFIED WITH THE PROSPECT OF RENEWING HIS PAINS AND FATIGUE HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO MAINTAIN THE FEW RESOURCES WHICH REMAINED TO A DESPERATE CAUSE AND THOUGHT THAT THE SAME REGARD TO HONOR WHICH HAD AT FIRST CALLED HIM TO ARMS
THE LESS WOULD THEY BE INCLINED TO SECOND THAT RASH AND DANGEROUS ENTERPRISE THAT THE PEERS WOULD CERTAINLY REFUSE THEIR CONCURRENCE NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES OF PREVAILING ON THEM BUT BY INSTIGATING THE POPULACE TO TUMULT AND DISORDER
CROMWELL PRETENDED TO RETALIATE BY THIS SEVERE EXECUTION THE CRUELTY OF THE IRISH MASSACRE BUT HE WELL KNEW THAT ALMOST THE WHOLE GARRISON WAS ENGLISH AND HIS JUSTICE WAS ONLY A BARBAROUS POLICY IN ORDER TO TERRIFY ALL OTHER GARRISONS FROM RESISTANCE
THE ONLY ONE WHICH REMAINED OF HIS PREROGATIVE UNDER COLOR OF PROVIDING FOR NATIONAL PEACE ENDANGERED BY THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ENGLISH ARMIES WAS A CONVENTION CALLED AN ASSEMBLY WHICH THOUGH IT MEETS WITH LESS SOLEMNITY
THE PEERS VOTED A DECLARATION AGAINST THOSE TUMULTS AND SENT IT TO THE LOWER HOUSE BUT THESE REFUSED THEIR CONCURRENCE SOME SEDITIOUS APPRENTICES BEING SEIZED AND COMMITTED TO PRISON IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED THEIR LIBERTY
AND FOR THE OBSERVANCE AND PRESERVATION OF THE LAWS AND I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS AND ASSIST THOSE LAWS FOR MY PRESERVATION NO SOONER DID THE COMMONS DESPAIR OF OBTAINING THE KING'S CONSENT TO THEIR BILL THAN THEY INSTANTLY VOTED
MANY OF THE PRESBYTERIANS SHOWED THE INCONVENIENCE AND DANGER OF THE PROJECTED ALTERATION WHITLOCKE IN PARTICULAR A MAN OF HONOR WHO LOVED HIS COUNTRY THOUGH IN EVERY CHANGE OF GOVERNMENT HE ALWAYS ADHERED TO THE RULING POWER SAID
AND DO ACCORDINGLY CONCEIVE OURSELVES WHOLLY BOUND TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF HIS MAJESTY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND ARE RESOLVED BY GOD'S HELP TO KEEP THIS CITY ACCORDINGLY
MUNIFICENT AND GENEROUS IN HIS EXPENSE POLITE AND ELEGANT IN HIS TASTE COURTEOUS AND HUMANE IN HIS BEHAVIOR HE BROUGHT A GREAT ACCESSION OF FRIENDS AND OF CREDIT TO THE PARTY WHICH HE EMBRACED
BEING A NATIVE OF IRELAND AND A PERSON ENDOWED WITH GREAT PRUDENCE AND VIRTUE FORMED A SCHEME FOR COMPOSING THE DISORDERS OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR ENGAGING THE REBEL IRISH TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE OF HIS ROYAL MASTER
THAT THIS NOBLEMAN HAD WILFULLY NEGLECTED AT DENNINGTON CASTLE A FAVORABLE OPPORTUNITY OF FINISHING THE WAR BY A TOTAL DEFEAT OF THE ROYALISTS I SHOWED HIM EVIDENTLY SAID CROMWELL HOW THIS SUCCESS MIGHT BE OBTAINED
AND THAT THE HOUSE OF PEERS WOULD HAVE NO PART IN THE HONOR NAY THEY WENT SO FAR AS OPENLY TO TELL THE LORDS THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF THE WHOLE KINGDOM
AND RESOUNDED WITH THE DANGERS WHICH THREATENED RELIGION FROM THE DESPERATE ATTEMPTS OF PAPISTS AND MALIGNANTS MULTITUDES FLOCKED TOWARDS WESTMINSTER AND INSULTED THE PRELATES AND SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ADHERED TO THE CROWN
AND THIS MEANT REVEALING OUR POSITION AND THERE ALL THE TIME WERE THE ENEMY STEADILY MAKING THEIR WAY RIGHT TOWARDS US WHAT SHALL I DO I SAID TO MYSELF AS I REALISED IN A SMALL WAY WHAT MUST BE THE FEELINGS OF A GENERAL WHO FINDS THAT THE BATTLE IS GOING AGAINST HIM
HOW TIGHTLY PROBABLY THEY NEVER KNEW THEN I REMEMBER THAT MY HEAD SUDDENLY SEEMED TO GROW CLEAR
MASS JOE NO GUN NO POWDER POP NO CHOPPER NO KNIFE NO FIGHT WORKS TALL WHERE IS HE I SAID EXCITEDLY AS I HELD THE ARM OF OUR GUIDE BLACKS COMING AFTER US
WITH A FEW SILVERY CLOUDS FLOATING AWAY IN THE REAR OF THE STORM WHILE THE SUN SHONE DOWN GLORIOUSLY IT SEEMED TOO HARD TO BEAR
AND USED THEIR WAR CLUBS IN THE MOST GALLANT MANNER JIMMY TOO SEEMED TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO AS BRAVE A BLACK WARRIOR AS EVER FOUGHT AND IT WAS THE GALLANT RESISTANCE OFFERED
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY EVIL WILL RESULT FROM IT HIST HE IS COMING TO OUR CONVERSATION HAD BEEN CARRIED ON IN A WHISPER AND WE NOW STOPPED SHORT AND WATCHED THE DOCTOR'S PATIENT IN THE DIM TWILIGHT OF THE CAVERN
THAT'S RIGHT HE SAID I SHALL DO THE SAME WE MIGHT REACH SOME LEDGE LOWER DOWN HE SAID THAT WORD MIGHT WITH A SLOW
AND THEN I JOINED THE DOCTOR IN SEARCHING
HE HAD OBTAINED FROM OUR GUIDE THE LATTER CHECKED HIM THOUGH LAYING A HAND UPON HIS ARM AS HE SAID TO ME AFTER LISTENING INTENTLY YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT THESE PEOPLE ARE TOO STRONG YOU MUST ESCAPE
THE POOR DAZED CREATURE TURNED TO THE DOCTOR NOW AND BENT TOWARDS HIM HOLDING HIM BY THE ARM THIS TIME CHIEF'S HUT YES RIGHT ACROSS
WITH HIS LIPS TO MY EAR THE STORM HIGH UP THE MOUNTAINS FLOOD THE GORGE JUST THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER CRASHING PEAL OF THUNDER CLOSE UPON A FLASH OF LIGHTNING AND THE HISSING RAIN CEASED AS IF BY MAGIC
THAT WHEN THE FINAL STRUGGLE WAS AT HAND WE SHOULD BE SO CLASPED TOGETHER THAT SWIMMING WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE AND WE MUST ALL BE DROWNED AND NOW ONCE MORE WITH THE WATER RISING STEADILY
LIKE THE BLACK AGAINST BULLETS WHICH HE SAID CAME TOO MUCH FASTER FASTER TO TOP AND AS THE SAVAGE MADE THE BLOW AT ME I FOLLOWED OUT JIMMY'S TACTICS THREW MYSELF FORWARD
I'M READY STOP FOR YOUR LIVES SAID A VOICE AT OUR ELBOW AND TURNING I SAW MISTER FRANCIS WITH HIS SWARTHY FACE LIT UP BY THE FIRE YOU COULD NOT GET NEAR THE HUT NOW WITHOUT BEING SEEN
IT IS A SIGNAL FOR US TO COME BACK HOW DO YOU KNOW WE AGREED UPON IT I SAID HE WAS TO SEND THE DOG IN SEARCH OF US IF WE DID NOT JOIN HIM IN TWO HOURS AND IF WE WERE IN TROUBLE
CHAPTER THIRTY TWO HOW WE HEARD A BLACK DISCUSSION AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE RESCUE PARTY CONSISTED OF THE DOCTOR
AND TO SET MY BRAIN AT WORK SCHEMING IT SEEMED TO GROW DARKER JUST THEN THE STARS FADING OUT BEHIND A THICK VEIL OF CLOUDS AND CREEPING NEARER TO THE DOCTOR I SAT DOWN BESIDE WHERE HE KNELT
CAN WE DO ANYTHING DOCTOR I SAID AT LAST IN A LOW AWE STRICKEN VOICE HE GAZED AT ME TENDERLY AND HELD OUT HIS HAND TO PRESS MINE WHEN I LAID IT IN HIS GRASP
THAN TO HIDE HIS CRIME BY THROWING SUSPICION ON SOME ONE ELSE HE COULD FORCE THE DOOR OF THE SAFE BEFORE HE LEFT AT NIGHT AND DROP A KEY OF THE BANK DOOR WHICH HE HAD SECRETLY MADE
THE MAN WHO HAD FALLEN SO LOW AS TO DRAG OUT A WRETCHED EXISTENCE BY COPYING LAW PAPERS WHOM UNTIL SHE SAW THE HANDWRITING IN THE LAWYER'S HANDS SHE HAD BELIEVED TO BE DEAD WAS A MAN LADY DEDLOCK HAD ONCE LOVED
WHICH HE CONCEALED IN THE CELL WALL DENOUNCING THE FAMILY OF EVREMONDE AND ALL THEIR DESCENDANTS THE READING OF THIS PAPER BY DEFARGE AS MAY BE GUESSED AROUSED ALL THE MURDEROUS PASSIONS OF THE PEOPLE IN THE COURT ROOM
HE LIVED THERE TILL HE WAS A PALE HANDSOME BOY OF NINE YEARS AND THEN HE WAS TAKEN TO THE WORKHOUSE WHERE WITH MANY OTHER BOYS OF HIS OWN AGE OR OLDER HE HAD TO WORK HARD ALL DAY PICKING OAKUM
HIS JOINTS WERE GETTING STIFF HE MISSED IN HIS TUMBLING AND HE COULD NO LONGER MAKE THE PEOPLE LAUGH AS HE HAD ONCE DONE
BOUNDERBY FLEW INTO A STILL GREATER RAGE AND STAMPED OFF SWEARING HIS WIFE SHOULD COME HOME BY NOON NEXT DAY OR NOT AT ALL TO BE SURE LOUISA DID NOT GO AND NEXT DAY BOUNDERBY SENT HER CLOTHES TO MISTER GRADGRIND
HE HAD COME TO THIS MELANCHOLY CONCLUSION THIS VERY DAY AND HAD SENT SISSY OUT ON AN ERRAND SO THAT HE MIGHT SLIP AWAY ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DOG MERRYLEGS WHILE SHE WAS ABSENT
SHE HAD PICKED UP A HAT AND INSIDE IT WAS THE NAME STEPHEN BLACKPOOL AN INSTANT LATER A SCREAM BROKE FROM HER LIPS THAT ECHOED OVER THE COUNTRY SIDE
THAT HER GRANDFATHER WAS NOT A THIEF AND THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS DOING WHEN HE STOLE HER MONEY BUT SHE KNEW TOO THAT IF PEOPLE FOUND OUT HE WAS CRAZY THEY WOULD TAKE HIM AWAY FROM HER AND SHUT HIM UP WHERE SHE COULD NOT BE WITH HIM AND OF THIS SHE COULD NOT BEAR TO THINK
IT WAS THIS A WICKED MAN SO WICKED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF THUNDER WHO WENT BY THE NAME OF MONKS HAD COME TO HIM AND TOLD HIM HE WOULD PAY A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
THE WAVES THREW HIS DROWNED BODY FINALLY ON THE EDGE OF A DISMAL SWAMP IN THE RED GLARE OF THE BLAZING RUIN WHICH THE OVERTURNED STOVE THAT NIGHT MADE OF THE BUILDING IN WHICH HE HAD FRAMED HIS EVIL PLOTS AND THIS WAS THE END OF QUILP THE DWARF
THERE WAS A FURTHER REASON FOR MADAME DEFARGE'S HATRED FOR THE POOR WOMAN WHOM DARNAY'S UNCLE HAD SO WRONGED HAD BEEN HER OWN SISTER IN VAIN OLD DOCTOR MANETTE PLEADED
SLEARY FOR SISSY'S SAKE HAD PROVIDED TOM WITH A DISGUISE IN WHICH NOT EVEN HIS FATHER RECOGNIZED HIM
OH MY CHILD MY CHILD NOT DEAD IN THE FIRST HOURS OF HER LIFE AS MY CRUEL SISTER TOLD ME BUT STERNLY NURTURED BY HER AFTER SHE HAD RENOUNCED ME AND MY NAME
BUT SIKES DREW HIS PISTOL WITH A FRIGHTFUL OATH AND DRAGGED HIM ON IN THE BACK OF THE HOUSE WAS A WINDOW WHICH WAS NOT FASTENED BECAUSE IT WAS MUCH TOO SMALL FOR A MAN TO GET THROUGH BUT OLIVER WAS SO LITTLE THAT HE COULD DO IT EASILY
WONDERED TO SEE HIS BOWED FORM HAUNTING THE PLACE NOTHING CAME OF HIS WAITING HOWEVER AND THE FOURTH MORNING SAW HIM WITH HIS THOUGHTS ON RACHEL TRUDGING OUT OF TOWN ALONG THE HIGHROAD BRAVELY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY
HOWEVER THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THE OLD BARONET LOVED HIS WIFE AND WAS VERY PROUD OF HER SIR LEICESTER'S FAMILY LAWYER WAS NAMED TULKINGHORN HE WAS A DULL DIGNIFIED MAN WHO ALWAYS DRESSED IN BLACK AND SELDOM SPOKE UNLESS HE HAD TO
NEXT DAY AT THE NOON HOUR HE WENT TO HIS EMPLOYER'S HOUSE TO ASK HIS ADVICE HE KNEW THE LAW SOMETIMES RELEASED TWO PEOPLE FROM THE MARRIAGE TIE WHEN ONE OR THE OTHER LIVED WICKEDLY
FOR THEY LIVED LIVES OF DEGENERATIVE PHYSICAL INERTIA HAVING MACHINERY OF EVERY DESCRIPTION FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ALL LABOR AND CONVENIENT CONVEYANCES FOR ANY MOVEMENT OF MORE THAN A FEW STEPS
AND THOSE OF THE BIG CAMBOSS OF COURSE BUT WILMA AIRILY HELD THAT THIS MEANT NOTHING AT ALL AND GENERALLY SUCCEEDED IN MAKING ME ADMIT IT WHENEVER SHE CHOSE I FOUND MYSELF A FULL FLEDGED MEMBER OF THE GANG NOW
AND A MOMENT LATER ANOTHER VAST HULK CRASHED TO EARTH I LOOKED OUT THEN STEPPED OUT ON THE GROUND THE ONLY HAN SHIPS IN THE SKY WERE TWO OF THE SCOUTS TO THE SOUTH WHICH WERE HANGING PERPENDICULARLY AND SAGGING SLOWLY DOWN
HIS COMMANDS SENDING OUT JUMPERS IN PURSUIT OF THE DESCENDING SHIP RANG IN MY EARS BUT I PAID NO ATTENTION TO THEM I LEAPED BACK INTO THE COMPARTMENT OF THE HAN SHIP AND KNELT BESIDE MY WILMA HER PADDED HELMET HAD ABSORBED MUCH OF THE BLOW
DIRECTLY UNDER THE REGULAR SHIP ROUTES OF THE HANS WHO AS A MATTER OF PRECAUTION
AND CONTROL THE PAYING OUT OF THE LINE WE ALL HAD OUR ULTROPHONES IN PLACE INSIDE OUR AIR HELMETS AND SO COULD CONVERSE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND WITH GIBBONS BUT AT WILMA'S SUGGESTION
WHERE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WORLD OVERGROWN WITH A VAST FOREST AND NO VISIBLE SIGN OF HUMAN HABITATION MET MY EYES I SHALL PASS OVER THE DAYS OF MENTAL AGONY THAT FOLLOWED IN MY ATTEMPT TO GRASP THE MEANING OF IT ALL
WILMA HUNT FOR THAT RECORD I SAID KNOWING THAT BY THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF TALKING I COULD KEEP THE ENTIRE COMMAND CONTINUOUSLY INFORMED AS TO THE SITUATION ON THE HILLSIDES KEEP YOUR GUNS TRAINED ON THE CIRCLES AND STAND BY ON THE HILLTOPS HOW MANY OF YOU ARE THERE
WILMA AND I HAD BEEN MARRIED THE DAY AFTER THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SHIPS AND SPENT THIS INTERVENING PERIOD IN A DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON CAMPING HIGH IN THE MOUNTAINS ON OUR RETURN WE HAD A CAMP OF OUR OWN
BUT WILMA AND I HAD RAISED THE FLAPS OF OUR HELMETS AND SWITCHED OFF OUR SPEAKERS FOR CONVERSATION BETWEEN OURSELVES AND BY THE TIME WE DISCOVERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED THE SHIPS WERE CLEARLY VISIBLE SO FAST WERE THEY APPROACHING JUMP WE HEARD THE BOSS ORDER DEERING TO THE NORTH ROGERS TO THE EAST
FOR THEY NEEDED NOT THE FORESTS IN WHICH THE AMERICANS LIVED NOR THE RESOURCES OF THE VAST TERRITORIES THESE FORESTS COVERED WITH THE PERFECTION TO WHICH THEY HAD REDUCED THE SYNTHETIC PRODUCTION OF NECESSITIES AND LUXURIES
HAD SOFTENED AND DEVITALIZED THE HANS IT HAD LIKEWISE DEVELOPED BENEATH THE PROTECTING FOLIAGE OF THE FOREST THE GROWTH OF A VIGOROUS NEW AMERICAN CIVILIZATION
AND IT ISN'T INFORMATION THE HANS ARE GIVING IN RETURN BUT SOME FORM OF GOODS OR PRIVILEGE
MAKING THE UNMODIFIED SUNLIGHT UNNECESSARY FOR HEALTH AND UNDESIRABLE FOR COMFORT SINCE THE HANS DID NOT HAVE THE SECRET OF INERTRON NONE OF THEM WORE ANTI GRAVITY BELTS
I OPENED THE TRAP AND LOOKED DOWN BUT QUICKLY SHUT IT AGAIN WHEN I FELT THE AIR RUSHING OUT OF THE SHIP INTO THE RAREFIED ATMOSPHERE IN A TORRENT GIBBONS LITERALLY YELLED A PROTEST FROM HIS INSTRUMENT BOARD I FORGOT I MUMBLED
THEY'RE PUTTING ARMOR OF GREAT THICKNESS IN THE HULLS OF THEIR SHIPS BELOW THE REP RAY MACHINES NEAR BAH FLO
BUT WILMA LOOKED AT ME MEANINGLY AND POINTED TO WHERE THE TWISTED PLATES OF THE SHIP PROJECTING FROM THE GROUND OFFERED A SHELTER TOO LATE BOSS SHE SAID THEY'D SEE US
THE RECORD OF THE INTERIOR REAR VIEWPLATE SHOWS MEMBERS OF THE CREW CLIMBING TOWARD THE REAR REP RAY GENERATOR IN AN ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH MANUAL CONTROL OF IT AND INCREASE THE LIFT THE PROJECTOSCOPE RELAYS
AND WOULD AT THE SAME TIME BE A BITING SATIRE ON THE DEMIGODS OF FRENCH LITERATURE WHO HAD DARED TO EXCLUDE HIM FROM THEIR SOCIETY THAT HE MIGHT NOT MEET THE SAME REFUSAL ON THE PART OF THE ACADEMY OF BOLOGNA AS HE HAD EXPERIENCED IN PARIS
MARY W WHITNEY OF VASSAR MARY E BOYD OF SMITH SUSAN CUNNINGHAM OF SWARTHMORE AND ANNIE S YOUNG OF MT HOLYOKE
TAKE CHARGE OF HER HUSBAND'S SCHOOL AFTER HIS DEATH AND DOES NOT ANTIQUITY CREDIT HER WITH BEING NOT ONLY A SUCCESSFUL TEACHER OF PHILOSOPHY BUT ALSO A WRITER OF BOOKS OF RECOGNIZED VALUE
ON THE EVENING OF OCTOBER FIRST EIGHTEEN FORTY SEVEN SHE WAS THE DISCOVERER OF A COMET THAT ATTRACTED GREAT ATTENTION BECAUSE IT SECURED FOR HER A MEDAL OFFERED BY THE KING OF DENMARK IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE
AND ASSISTANT TO HER BROTHER CAROLINE FOUND TIME TO PREPARE A NUMBER OF WORKS FOR THE PRESS AMONG THESE WERE A CATALOGUE OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY STARS OBSERVED BY FLAMSTEED BUT NOT INCLUDED IN THE BRITISH CATALOGUE
BEYOND THE SPHERE AND CAPACITY OF WHAT WAS ASSUMED TO BE THE INTELLECTUALLY WEAKER SEX
WE HAVE SEEN IN CONSIDERING HER INTELLECTUAL ATTAINMENTS
AFTER THE MECHANISM OF THE HEAVENS THE PHILOSOPHICAL CONNECTION OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES
THE SECOND LETTER OF VOLTAIRE IS IN RESPONSE TO ONE RECEIVED FROM LAURA BASSI ANNOUNCING THAT HE HAD BEEN ELECTED TO MEMBERSHIP IN THE BOLOGNA ACADEMY
HOW DIFFERENT IT WAS IN THE CASE OF LAURA BASSI
FOR THE NAUTICAL ALMANAC A POSITION SHE HELD FOR NINETEEN YEARS DURING THE SAME PERIOD SHE WAS EMPLOYED BY THE UNITED STATES COAST SURVEY WHEN VASSAR COLLEGE WAS OPENED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE
WHEN HOWEVER IN NINETEEN O TWO SHE WAS FORMALLY NOMINATED FOR FELLOWSHIP IN THIS SAME SOCIETY SHE FAILED OF ELECTION BECAUSE THE COUNCIL OF THE SOCIETY DISCOVERED THAT
ENDOWED WITH A SOUL AND A GENIUS FAR ABOVE THAT OF ORDINARY MORTALS AND AS BEING THE POSSESSOR OF A TALENT THAT INDICATED SOMETHING SUPERHUMAN
DOES NOT HESITATE TO DECLARE THAT CERTAIN OF CAEDMON'S VERSES RESEMBLED SO CLOSELY CERTAIN PASSAGES OF THE PARADISE LOST THAT SOME OF MILTON'S LINES SEEM ALMOST LIKE A TRANSLATION FROM THE WORK OF HIS DISTINGUISHED PREDECESSOR
THE MOTHERS OF THE GREATEST POETS ARTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS OF ALL TIME BUT IT EXHIBITS RATHER HER GOOD FORTUNE IN BEING ABLE TO EFFECT A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GREATEST STATESMAN OF GREECE
WHOSE MINDS HAD HITHERTO BEEN CONFINED TO THE COMPARATIVELY BARREN FIELD OF ROMAN LETTERS THE SPLENDID CREATIONS OF GREEK GENIUS CAME AS A REVELATION TO BECOME THOROUGHLY VERSED IN GREEK POETRY AND PROFICIENT IN THE TEACHINGS OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY
WHICH WERE CENTERS OF LITERARY ACTIVITY AND OF NUNS WHO DISTINGUISHED THEMSELVES BY THEIR LEARNING AND BY THE BENIGN INFLUENCE WHICH THEY EXERTED FAR BEYOND THE WALLS OF THE CLOISTER I CANNOT HOWEVER REFRAIN FROM REFERRING TO THAT GROUP OF LEARNED ENGLISH NUNS
BY DEDICATING TO THEM A GREAT NUMBER OF HIS MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS
AND SO GREAT WAS HER REPUTATION FOR KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM THAT NOT ONLY PRIESTS AND BISHOPS BUT ALSO PRINCES AND KINGS SOUGHT HER COUNSEL IN IMPORTANT MATTERS OF CHURCH AND STATE AS TO THE MONKS SUBJECT TO HER AUTHORITY
I CANNOT EXACTLY REMEMBER WHAT I DID OR HOW MUCH BUT MY BOOK ABOUT CATS
I GIVE THE AUTHOR'S WORDS AS I FIND THEM THE CAT IS A FAITHLESS DOMESTIC AND ONLY KEPT THROUGH NECESSITY TO OPPOSE TO ANOTHER DOMESTIC WHICH INCOMMODES US STILL MORE AND WHICH WE CANNOT DRIVE AWAY
DRAW CATS TOGETHER AND FASCINATE THEM WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS IN THE NEW MOON GATHER THE HERB NEPE AND DRY IT IN THE HEAT OF THE SUN WHEN IT IS TEMPERATELY HOT
THE HORSE RIDDEN BY A MAN WHO HAS GOT ANY CAT'S HAIR ON HIS CLOTHING WILL PERSPIRE VIOLENTLY AND SOON BECOME EXHAUSTED IF THE WIND BLOWS OVER A CAT RIDING IN A VEHICLE UPON THE HORSE DRAWING IT IT WILL WEARY THE HORSE VERY MUCH
WHEN THE WITCH FINDER HAD DONE IN NEWCASTLE AND RECEIVED HIS WAGES HE WENT INTO NORTHUMBERLAND TO TRY WOMEN THERE AND GOT THREE POUNDS A PIECE
THEY STAND OUT ON EACH SIDE IN THE LION AS WELL AS IN THE COMMON CAT SO THAT FROM POINT TO POINT THEY ARE EQUAL IN WIDTH TO THE ANIMAL'S BODY IF WE IMAGINE THEREFORE A LION STEALING THROUGH A COVERT OF WOOD IN AN IMPERFECT LIGHT
WHETHER IN PLAY OR IN EARNEST CATS ARE THE VERY EMBODIMENT OF ELEGANCE AS YOUR CAT RUBS HER HEAD AGAINST SOMETHING YOU OFFER HER WHICH SHE EITHER DOES NOT FANCY OR DOES NOT WANT SHE INSTRUCTS YOU THAT THERE IS A GRACIOUS MODE OF REFUSING A THING
VIRGIL HAS ALSO MADE THE SUBJECT A THEME FOR POETIC ALLUSION THE CHINESE LOOK INTO THEIR CAT'S EYES TO KNOW WHAT O'CLOCK IT IS
SAID FOX CHOSE OF COURSE THE SHADY SIDE OF THE WAY AS MOST AGREEABLE I KNEW THAT THE SUNNY SIDE WOULD BE LEFT FOR ME AND THAT CATS PREFER THE SUNSHINE CATS USUALLY BUT NOT ALWAYS FALL ON THEIR FEET BECAUSE OF THE FACILITY WITH WHICH THEY BALANCE THEMSELVES WHEN SPRINGING FROM A HEIGHT
THEY ARE ORGANS OF TOUCH THEY ARE ATTACHED TO A BED OF CLOSE GLANDS UNDER THE SKIN AND EACH OF THESE LONG AND STIFF HAIRS IS CONNECTED WITH THE NERVES OF THE LIP THE SLIGHTEST CONTACT OF THESE WHISKERS WITH ANY SURROUNDING OBJECT IS THUS FELT MOST DISTINCTLY BY THE ANIMAL ALTHOUGH THE HAIRS ARE OF THEMSELVES INSENSIBLE
TESTING ALL BY THESE MODES OF TRIAL AND ENDING IN THE CRUEL DEATHS OF MANY WRETCHED OLD PERSONS A REACTION AGAINST HIM TOOK PLACE PROBABLY AT THE INSTIGATION OF SOME WHOSE FRIENDS HAD BEEN CONDEMNED INNOCENTLY OR OF THOSE WHO WERE TOO WISE TO BELIEVE IN HIS TESTS
IN THEIR NOISELESS TREAD AND STEALTHY MOVEMENTS WE ARE REMINDED OF THE FREQUENT IMPORTANCE OF SECRESY AND CAUTION PRIOR TO ACTION WHILE THEIR PROMPTITUDE AT THE RIGHT MOMENT WARNS US ON THE OTHER HAND AGAINST THE EVILS OF IRRESOLUTION AND DELAY
CONSEQUENTLY THOSE WHO WERE ACCUSED OF DIABOLICAL PRACTICES WERE TIED NECK AND HEELS TOGETHER AND TOSSED INTO A POND IF THEY FLOATED OR SWAM THEY WERE GUILTY AND THEREFORE TAKEN OUT AND HANGED OR BURNT IF THEY WERE INNOCENT THEY WERE DROWNED
CARE WILL KILL A CAT ONE SAYS AND YET CATS ARE SAID TO HAVE NINE LIVES LET US HOPE THAT POOR PUSSY WILL NEVER BE PUT TO A WORSE DEATH A MUFFLED CAT IS NO GOOD MOUSER THAT CAT IS OUT OF KIND THAT SWEET MILK WILL NOT LAP
BUT THE WORD HAS ONE OR TWO OTHER MEANINGS FOR INSTANCE IN THIEVES SLANG THE WORD CAT SIGNIFIES A LADY'S MUFF AND TO FREE A CAT TO STEAL A MUFF AMONG SOLDIERS AND SAILORS A CAT MEANS SOMETHING VERY UNPLEASANT INDEED
AGAIN NOTHING CAN BE MORE UNJUST THAN TO CALL CATS CRUEL IF SUCH A WORD AS CRUEL COULD BE APPLIED TO A CREATURE WITHOUT REASON FEW ANIMALS COULD BE FOUND MORE CRUEL THAN A ROBIN REDBREAST
IT WAS VERY REQUISITE THAT THESE WITCH FINDERS SHOULD TAKE CARE TO GO TO NO TOWNS BUT WHERE THEY MIGHT DO WHAT THEY WOULD WITHOUT BEING CONTROLLED BY STICKLERS BUT IF THE TIMES HAD NOT BEEN AS THEY WERE THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND BUT FEW TOWNS WHERE THEY MIGHT BE SUFFERED TO USE THE TRIAL OF THE STOOL
BUT THE SPARROW FLEW AWAY THIS VEXED PUSSY EXTREMELY AND HE SAID AS LONG AS I LIVE I WILL EAT FIRST AND WASH MY FACE AFTERWARDS WHICH ALL CATS DO EVEN TO THIS DAY
