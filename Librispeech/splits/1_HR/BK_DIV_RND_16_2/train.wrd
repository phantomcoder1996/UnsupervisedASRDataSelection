WHATEVER WAY THEY TURNED BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE MIDDLE IT BECAME SO REGULAR AT LENGTH
NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW ON THIS LINE WE SAID WHAT YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU'RE GOING YOU KNOW THE WAY YOU SLIP OFF QUIETLY AND GO TO KINGSTON WELL I DON'T KNOW GENTS REPLIED THE NOBLE FELLOW
MUSINGS ON ANTIQUITY I FORGET THAT I AM STEERING INTERESTING RESULT HAMPTON COURT MAZE HARRIS AS A GUIDE IT WAS A GLORIOUS MORNING
UNUSED HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN UP STUFFING HIMSELF WITH EGGS AND BACON IRRITATING THE DOG OR FLIRTING WITH THE SLAVEY INSTEAD OF SPRAWLING THERE SUNK IN SOUL CLOGGING OBLIVION IT WAS A TERRIBLE THOUGHT
I FELT MYSELF BEING DREAMILY LULLED OFF INTO A MUSING FIT I MUSED ON KINGSTON OR KYNINGESTUN
AND THEY WENT LOOKING FOR IT ALL OVER THE ROOM I'LL TAKE MY OATH I PUT IT DOWN ON THAT CHAIR SAID GEORGE STARING AT THE EMPTY SEAT I SAW YOU DO IT MYSELF NOT A MINUTE AGO SAID HARRIS THEN THEY STARTED ROUND THE ROOM AGAIN LOOKING FOR IT
WHEN HE CALLED THERE FOR ORDERS THE MORNING AFTER THE CRIME ASSISTED BY NO TWENTY ONE WHO HAPPENED TO BE ON THE STEP AT THE TIME TO PROVE A COMPLETE ALIBI IT WOULD HAVE GONE HARD WITH HIM I DIDN'T KNOW BIGGS'S BOY AT THAT TIME BUT
HE WOULD BE STRICKEN DOWN WITH RHEUMATIC FEVER AND HE WOULD GO OUT IN A NOVEMBER FOG AND COME HOME WITH A SUNSTROKE THEY PUT HIM UNDER LAUGHING GAS ONE YEAR POOR LAD AND DREW ALL HIS TEETH AND GAVE HIM A FALSE SET BECAUSE HE SUFFERED SO TERRIBLY WITH TOOTHACHE AND THEN IT TURNED TO
A GOOD STATION FOR FISHING AND FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN OF THE DISTRICT I AM QUITE PREPARED TO BEAR OUT THIS STATEMENT THERE IS NO SPOT IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU CAN GET MORE FISHING
WHERE THEY CAME DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE LOOKED QUITE PICTURESQUE IN THE FLASHING SUNLIGHT THE GLINTING RIVER WITH ITS DRIFTING BARGES THE WOODED TOWPATH THE TRIM KEPT VILLAS ON THE OTHER SIDE HARRIS IN A RED AND ORANGE BLAZER GRUNTING AWAY AT THE SCULLS
GOT UP AND LEFT HIS SEAT AND SAT ON HIS BACK AND STUCK HIS LEGS IN THE AIR
THE GREATEST NUMBER OF FISH HE EVER CAUGHT IN ONE DAY WAS THREE AND YOU CAN'T ADD TWENTY FIVE PER CENT TO THREE AT LEAST NOT IN FISH SO HE INCREASED HIS PERCENTAGE TO THIRTY THREE AND A THIRD
THAT THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF GRASPING ANYTHING AND SO THE MAN TOLD THEM TO STOP WHERE THEY WERE AND HE WOULD COME TO THEM THEY HUDDLED TOGETHER AND WAITED AND HE CLIMBED DOWN AND CAME IN HE WAS A YOUNG KEEPER AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT AND NEW TO THE BUSINESS
AND SAYS OH NO SIR
WHATEVER WAY THEY TURNED BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE MIDDLE IT BECAME SO REGULAR AT LENGTH THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE STOPPED THERE AND WAITED FOR THE OTHERS TO TAKE A WALK ROUND AND COME BACK TO THEM
THAT THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF GRASPING ANYTHING AND SO THE MAN TOLD THEM TO STOP WHERE THEY WERE AND HE WOULD COME TO THEM THEY HUDDLED TOGETHER AND WAITED AND HE CLIMBED DOWN AND CAME IN HE WAS A YOUNG KEEPER AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT AND NEW TO THE BUSINESS AND WHEN HE GOT IN
WE WENT UPSTAIRS AND ASKED THE TRAFFIC SUPERINTENDENT AND HE TOLD US THAT HE HAD JUST MET A MAN WHO SAID HE HAD SEEN IT AT NUMBER THREE PLATFORM WE WENT TO NUMBER THREE PLATFORM
THEY MET SOME PEOPLE SOON AFTER THEY HAD GOT INSIDE
ANYHOW THEY HAD GOT SOMETHING TO START FROM THEN THEY DID KNOW WHERE THEY WERE AND THE MAP WAS ONCE MORE CONSULTED AND THE THING SEEMED SIMPLER THAN EVER AND OFF THEY STARTED FOR THE THIRD TIME
SHE IS A GRANDDAUGHTER OF BRIGHAM YOUNG SLENDER AND GRACEFUL WITH LILY WHITE CHEEKS TINTED WITH CLEAR ROSE SHE WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE OLD SALT LAKE ZION HOUSE BUT BY SOME STRANGE CHANCE
I REACHED CAMP ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE DUSK HOLLOWED A STRIP OF LOOSE GROUND IN THE LEE OF A LARGE BLOCK OF RED LAVA WHERE FIREWOOD WAS ABUNDANT ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS AND WENT TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING
HE IS A DANGEROUS ANIMAL A NEAR RELATIVE OF THE FAMOUS GRIZZLY AND WISE HUNTERS ARE VERY FOND OF LETTING HIM ALONE THE TOWNS OF PUGET SOUND ARE OF A VERY LIVELY PROGRESSIVE AND ASPIRING KIND
STILL MORE STRIKING ARE THEIR QUEER CAMPS ON THE EDGES OF THE FIELDS OR OVER ON THE RIVER BANK WITH THE FIRELIGHT SHINING ON THEIR WILD JOLLY FACES BUT WOE TO THE RANCH SHOULD FIRE WATER GET THERE BUT THE CHIEF ATTRACTIONS HERE ARE NOT FOUND IN THE HOPS
HOW BEAUTIFUL SEEMED THE GOLDEN SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE WOODS BETWEEN THE WARM BROWN BOLES OF THE CEDARS AND PINES ALL MY FRIENDS AMONG THE BIRDS AND PLANTS SEEMED LIKE OLD FRIENDS AND WE FELT LIKE SPEAKING TO EVERY ONE OF THEM AS WE PASSED
YOU MAY WALK THE DESERTS OF THE GREAT BASIN IN THE BLOOM TIME OF THE YEAR ALL THE WAY ACROSS FROM THE SNOWY SIERRA TO THE SNOWY WAHSATCH AND YOUR EYES WILL BE FILLED WITH MANY A GAY MALVA AND POPPY AND ABRONIA AND CACTUS
THIRTY OR FORTY MILES EASTWARD FROM SEATTLE
AND EVEN FULL BLOWN TRANSCENDENTALISTS THOUGH YOU MAY GO FAR TO FIND THEM INDIANS ARE SELDOM TO BE MET WITH AWAY FROM THE SOUND EXCEPTING ABOUT THE FEW OUTLYING HOP RANCHES TO WHICH THEY RESORT IN GREAT NUMBERS DURING THE PICKING SEASON
HALF PRAIRIE LEVEL AND FERTILE AND BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSIFIED WITH OUTSTANDING GROVES OF SPRUCES AND ALDERS AND RICH FLOWERY FRINGES OF SPIRAEA AND WILD ROSES THE RIVER MEANDERING DEEP AND TRANQUIL THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT
EVEN AFTER THE STORM IS OVER WE SHALL HAVE TO WAIT FOR SUNSHINE AND WHEN WILL IT COME THE TEMPERED AREA TO WHICH WE HAD COMMITTED OURSELVES EXTENDED OVER ABOUT ONE FOURTH OF AN ACRE
AND I TOLD JEROME THAT WE TWO MOUNTAINEERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR WAY DOWN THROUGH ANY STORM LIKELY TO FALL PRESENTLY THIN FIBROUS FILMS OF CLOUD BEGAN TO BLOW DIRECTLY OVER THE SUMMIT FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
THE STORM BEGAN IN SERIOUS EARNEST AT FIRST THE CLIFFS WERE BEATEN WITH HAIL EVERY STONE OF WHICH AS FAR AS I COULD SEE WAS REGULAR IN FORM SIX SIDED PYRAMIDS WITH ROUNDED BASE RICH AND SUMPTUOUS LOOKING AND FASHIONED WITH LOVING CARE
STILL THE PAIN WAS NOT ALWAYS OF THAT BITTER INTENSE KIND THAT PRECLUDES THOUGHT AND TAKES AWAY ALL CAPACITY FOR ENJOYMENT A SORT OF DREAMY STUPOR CAME ON AT TIMES
SOME GO BOATING ON THE SOUND OR ON THE LAKES AND RIVERS OR WITH THEIR FAMILIES MAKE EXCURSIONS AT SMALL COST ON THE STEAMERS OTHERS WILL TAKE THE TRAIN TO THE FRANKLIN AND NEWCASTLE OR CARBON RIVER COAL MINES FOR THE SAKE OF THE THIRTY OR FORTY MILE RIDES THROUGH THE WOODS
AT LENGTH AFTER THE TEMPERATURE WAS SOMEWHAT MITIGATED ON THIS MEMORABLE FIRST OF MAY WE AROSE AND BEGAN TO STRUGGLE HOMEWARD OUR FROZEN TROUSERS COULD SCARCELY BE MADE TO BEND AT THE KNEE AND WE WADED THE SNOW WITH DIFFICULTY
FOR TO IT HUNDREDS OF THEM OWE THEIR LIVES DURING THE FAMINE YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT GREAT DESTITUTION PREVAILED ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN SETTLEMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF DROUTH AND GRASSHOPPERS
MINA IS FAST ASLEEP AND LOOKS A LITTLE TOO PALE HER EYES LOOK AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN CRYING POOR DEAR I'VE NO DOUBT IT FRETS HER TO BE KEPT IN THE DARK AND IT MAY MAKE HER DOUBLY ANXIOUS ABOUT ME AND THE OTHERS
AS IF A WOMAN CAN SLEEP WHEN THOSE SHE LOVES ARE IN DANGER I SHALL LIE DOWN AND PRETEND TO SLEEP LEST JONATHAN HAVE ADDED ANXIETY ABOUT ME WHEN HE RETURNS DOCTOR SEWARD'S DIARY
AND SO NOW WE SHALL NOT SPEAK OF IT LEST IT DISTRESS I SHALL STAY IN EXETER TO NIGHT FOR I WANT TO THINK MUCH OVER WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME AND WHEN I HAVE THOUGHT I WILL ASK YOU QUESTIONS IF I MAY AND THEN TOO
SINCE YOU SEEK TO IMPRESS US WITH YOUR COMPLETE REASONABLENESS YOU DO THIS WHOSE SANITY WE HAVE REASON TO DOUBT
IT CAN BUT MAKE YOUR HUSBAND LOVE YOU THE MORE AND ALL US YOUR FRIENDS MORE HONOUR YOU AS WELL AS MORE ESTEEM AND LOVE SHE TOOK IT BACK WITH ANOTHER BLUSH AND A BRIGHT SMILE AND SO NOW UP TO THIS VERY HOUR ALL THE RECORDS WE HAVE ARE COMPLETE AND IN ORDER
AND WITH THIS SLENDER CLUE I HAD TO START FOR POPLAR IT WAS TWELVE O'CLOCK BEFORE I GOT ANY SATISFACTORY HINT OF SUCH A BUILDING AND THIS I GOT AT A COFFEE SHOP WHERE SOME WORKMEN WERE HAVING THEIR DINNER
EVEN IF SHE BE NOT HARMED HER HEART MAY FAIL HER IN SO MUCH AND SO MANY HORRORS AND HEREAFTER SHE MAY SUFFER
MADAM MINA IT IS ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEAD I COME SIR I SAID YOU COULD HAVE NO BETTER CLAIM ON ME THAN THAT YOU WERE A FRIEND AND HELPER OF LUCY WESTENRA AND I HELD OUT MY HAND
HARKER IS OUT FOLLOWING UP CLUES AND SO ARE LORD GODALMING AND QUINCEY VAN HELSING SITS IN MY STUDY PORING OVER THE RECORD PREPARED BY THE HARKERS
AS MADAM MINA SAW HIM ON THE WINDOW AT WHITBY AND AS FRIEND JOHN SAW HIM FLY FROM THIS SO NEAR HOUSE AND AS MY FRIEND QUINCEY SAW HIM
I SHALL WRITE SO SOON AS EVER I CAN DOCTOR SEWARD'S DIARY TWENTY SIX SEPTEMBER TRULY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS FINALITY
ARE WE NOT PLEDGED TO DESTROY THIS MONSTER
HIS MUSIC AND HIS LOVE LIE FAR BEHIND YOU OTHERS ARE YOUNG SOME HAVE SEEN SORROW
I WANT TO SEE YOUR PATIENT MISTER RENFIELD DO LET ME SEE HIM WHAT YOU HAVE SAID OF HIM IN YOUR DIARY INTERESTS ME SO MUCH SHE LOOKED SO APPEALING AND SO PRETTY THAT I COULD NOT REFUSE HER AND THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE REASON WHY I SHOULD SO I TOOK HER WITH ME
I THOUGHT I WOULD PUSH HIS ANALOGY TO ITS UTMOST LOGICALLY SO I SAID QUICKLY OH IT IS A SOUL YOU ARE AFTER NOW IS IT HIS MADNESS FOILED HIS REASON AND A PUZZLED LOOK SPREAD OVER HIS FACE AS
ONLY AT CERTAIN TIMES CAN HE HAVE LIMITED FREEDOM IF HE BE NOT AT THE PLACE WHITHER HE IS BOUND HE CAN ONLY CHANGE HIMSELF AT NOON
I SOMETIMES THINK WE MUST BE ALL MAD AND THAT WE SHALL WAKE TO SANITY IN STRAIT WAISTCOATS LATER WE HAVE MET AGAIN WE SEEM AT LAST TO BE ON THE TRACK AND OUR WORK OF TO MORROW MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF THE END
BUT I DO MIND HE ANSWERED THE AFFAIRS OF THEIR CLIENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY SAFE IN THE HANDS OF MITCHELL SONS AND CANDY THIS WAS MANIFESTLY A PRIG OF THE FIRST WATER AND THERE WAS NO USE ARGUING WITH HIM
PARIS JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN FORTY GENTLEMEN IN THE COURSE OF YOUR DEBATE OF THE NINTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE IN REGARD TO THE TRIENNIAL PENSION ESTABLISHED BY MADAME SUARD
HAS ALWAYS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD IF BY AN INFALLIBLE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION I ESTABLISH THE DOGMA OF EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS IF I DETERMINE THE PRINCIPLE OF CIVIL LAW THE ESSENCE OF JUSTICE AND THE FORM OF SOCIETY
A THING WHICH HAPPENED ALMOST EVERY DAY AND EQUIP AND FEED HIMSELF AT HIS OWN EXPENSE THIS SPIRIT OF THE GERMAN TRIBES THIS SPIRIT OF COMPANIONSHIP AND ASSOCIATION GOVERNED THE TERRITORY AS IT GOVERNED INDIVIDUALS THE LANDS LIKE THE MEN
IN WHAT DID IT DIFFER FROM ROMAN SLAVERY AND WHENCE CAME THIS DIFFERENCE LET THE SAME AUTHOR ANSWER
TO DIMINISH IT OR TO CHANGE ITS NATURE HE CANNOT SO DIVIDE THE USUFRUCT THAT ANOTHER SHALL PERFORM THE LABOR WHILE HE RECEIVES THE PRODUCT IN A WORD
BY SCIENTIFIC METHODS AND IN A RIGOROUS MANNER I DEVOTED ONE YEAR TO PHILOLOGY AND GRAMMAR LINGUISTICS OR THE NATURAL HISTORY OF SPEECH BEING OF ALL THE SCIENCES THAT
THESE AGREEMENTS ESTABLISH ONLY YOUR RIGHT OF USE SUCH HOWEVER ARE THE ONLY TITLES WHICH PROPRIETORS ADVANCE THEY NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER ANY OTHERS INDEED EVERY RIGHT
AND THEIR CIVIL LIST BY THE TOTAL SOCIAL PRODUCTION DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF CITIZENS THUS JURISPRUDENCE POLITICAL ECONOMY AND PSYCHOLOGY AGREE IN ADMITTING THE LAW OF EQUALITY RIGHT AND DUTY
AMONG THE ANCIENTS THE REFUSAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL LIMITED THE POWERS OF THE STATE
WHO MIGHT DISCUSS THE QUESTION IN THE PRESENCE OF A STARVING AUDIENCE WE SHOULD HAVE PILLAGE FOR CONCLUSION AND PERORATION
IT IS THE DUTY OF THE CIVIL AND ADMINISTRATIVE POWER TO RECONSTRUCT ITSELF ON THE BASIS OF POLITICAL EQUALITY AN EVIL WHEN KNOWN SHOULD BE CONDEMNED AND DESTROYED THE LEGISLATOR CANNOT PLEAD IGNORANCE AS AN EXCUSE FOR UPHOLDING A GLARING INIQUITY
AND THEIR UNWARRANTED BLUNDERS HAVE DISGUSTED ME WHOEVER KNOWING THEM PARDONS THEM MAY READ THEM I HAVE SEVERELY BLAMED THE LEARNED CHRISTIAN CHURCH
BUT THE MAJESTIC AND IMPOSING ORDER OF HUMAN SOCIETIES THAT I SOMETIMES FIND MYSELF EMBARRASSED IN ATTACKING CERTAIN ABUSES I LIKE TO REBUILD WITH ONE HAND WHEN I AM COMPELLED TO DESTROY WITH THE OTHER
WHOEVER VIOLATED IT WAS UNJUST THUS LABOR GIVES BIRTH TO PRIVATE POSSESSION THE RIGHT IN A THING
EVERY MECHANIC WHO CANNOT BE A MASTER HAS TO BE A JOURNEYMAN EVERY PROPRIETOR WHO IS NOT AN INVADER WILL BE INVADED EVERY PRODUCER WHO CANNOT BY THE EXPLOITATION OF OTHER MEN FURNISH PRODUCTS AT LESS THAN THEIR PROPER VALUE WILL LOSE HIS LABOR
THEY DISREGARDED IT THE PRESENT WANT OCCUPIED THEIR WHOLE ATTENTION AND AS ORDINARILY HAPPENS IN SUCH CASES THE DISADVANTAGES WERE AT FIRST SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AND THEY PASSED UNNOTICED
AS ROUSSEAU EIGHTY YEARS AGO HANDLED LETTERS WITH A MAGNIFICENT AND POETICAL DISPLAY OF WIT AND KNOWLEDGE SUCH AT LEAST IS MY OPINION
FULL OF OBSTINACY ENEMIES OF PHILOSOPHY BURIED IN LITERALITIES
WHERE NOTHING STOLE AWAY THE SHORTEST MINUTE I HAD LOST MYSELF COMPLETELY IN WORK WHEN I HEARD FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE THERE WAS A STEEP FOOTPATH BETWEEN THE UPPER AND THE LOWER ROAD WHICH I CLIMBED TO SHORTEN THE WAY AS THE CHILDREN HAD TAUGHT ME
WORE A LOOK OF TROUBLE AND I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE TEASING SPIRIT OF ALMIRA IT WAS TOO PLEASANT TO STAY INDOORS ALTOGETHER EVEN IN SUCH REWARDING COMPANIONSHIP BESIDES I MIGHT MEET WILLIAM
WHO PRESENTLY HAD HER COURT INSIDE THE HOUSE WHILE MISSUS TODD LARGE HOSPITABLE AND PREEMINENT WAS THE CENTRE OF A RAPIDLY INCREASING CROWD ABOUT THE LILAC BUSHES
RIGHT FROM THE SCRIPTURE MEASUREMENTS SAME'S OTHER SAILORS MAKE LITTLE SHIPS AND DESIGN NEW TRICKS OF RIGGING
WEATHER AN OCCASION BOTH MADE TO MATCH YES IT SUITS ME I DON'T ASK NO MORE I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU SAW MOTHER WALKIN AT THE HEAD IT CHOKED ME RIGHT UP TO SEE MOTHER AT THE HEAD WALKIN WITH THE MINISTERS
EXCLAIMED MISSUS TODD WITH UNAFFECTED DELIGHT AND THESE KINDRED SPIRITS MET AND PARTED WITH THE PROMISE OF A GOOD TALK LATER ON AFTER THIS
OVER TO THE PORT THEY ALWAYS INVITE HIM TO MARCH DECORATION DAY SAME AS THE REST AN HE DOES LOOK NOBLE HE COMES OF SOLDIER STOCK
THEN WE MOVED EASILY TOWARD THE HOUSE TOGETHER SPEAKING OF THE FINE WEATHER AND OF MACKEREL WHICH WERE REPORTED TO BE STRIKING IN ALL ABOUT THE BAY WILLIAM HAD BEEN OUT SINCE THREE O'CLOCK AND HAD TAKEN AN EXTRA FARE OF FISH
AMIABILITY TWAS MOST TOO BAD TO CRAMP HIM DOWN TO HIS PEACEFUL TRADE BUT HE'S A MOST EXCELLENT SHOEMAKER AT HIS BEST AN HE ALWAYS SAYS IT'S A TRADE THAT GIVES HIM TIME TO THINK AN PLAN HIS MANEUVERS
TWOULDN'T HURT HER TO SIT DOWN AN HEAR HIS GREAT STORIES ONCE IN A WHILE THE STORIES ARE VERY INTERESTING I VENTURED TO SAY YES YOU ALWAYS CATCH YOURSELF A THINKIN WHAT IF THEY ALL WAS TRUE AND HE HAD THE RIGHT OF IT
TO THE POETS I WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH A SHIPMASTER THAT WAS ALL FOR BEES AN BEEKEEPIN AND IF YOU MET HIM IN PORT AND WENT ABOARD HE'D SIT
SO HE KEPT IT OVER MY MOTHER WAS THERE AND SHE THOUGHT CERTAIN TWAS ME NONE OF OUR FAMILY WAS EVER SUBJECT TO FITS INTERRUPTED MISSUS TODD SEVERELY NO
TWILL BRING OUT A GOOD MANY OF THE OLD FOLKS TIS SUCH A LOVELY DAY I'M ALWAYS GLAD NOT TO HAVE THEM DISAPPOINTED
THROUGH THIS PIECE OF ROUGH PASTURE RAN A HUGE SHAPE OF STONE LIKE THE GREAT BACKBONE OF AN ENORMOUS CREATURE AT THE END NEAR THE WOODS WE COULD CLIMB UP ON IT AND WALK ALONG TO THE HIGHEST POINT
HE HAD THE REFINEMENT OF LOOK AND AIR OF COMMAND WHICH ARE THE HERITAGE OF THE OLD ECCLESIASTICAL FAMILIES OF NEW ENGLAND BUT AS DARWIN SAYS IN HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY THERE IS NO SUCH KING AS A SEA CAPTAIN
HE SAT LOOKING AT ME EXPECTANTLY I COULD NOT HELP THINKING THAT WITH HIS QUEER HEAD AND LENGTH OF THINNESS HE WAS MADE TO HOP ALONG THE ROAD OF LIFE
AND FEEL THE COOL SALT BREEZE
WE CARRIED THE TOKENS AND INHERITANCE OF ALL SUCH HOUSEHOLDS FROM WHICH THIS HAD DESCENDED AND WERE ONLY THE LATEST OF OUR LINE WE POSSESSED THE INSTINCTS OF A FAR FORGOTTEN CHILDHOOD
TO AVOID ROUSING SUSPICION THEN I CAN WATCH FOR AT LEAST A PART OF EACH NIGHT AND PROBABLY MISTER INNES WILL HELP US OUT I WOULD SAY AS LITTLE TO THOMAS AS POSSIBLE THE OLD MAN KNOWS MORE THAN HE IS WILLING TO ADMIT
THIS WAS NOTHING LESS THAN THE LOOTING OF THE BANK'S SECURITIES TURNING THEM INTO MONEY AND MAKING HIS ESCAPE BUT THE LAW HAS LONG ARMS PAUL ARMSTRONG EVIDENTLY STUDIED THE SITUATION CAREFULLY JUST AS THE ONLY GOOD INDIAN IS A DEAD INDIAN
FULLY TWO YARDS BY HER MEASURE SHOT THROUGH THAT HOLE AND TUMBLED ON THE BED
WAS NOT TO BE FOUND IT WAS AFTER EIGHT WHEN HALSEY ORDERED THE CAR AND STARTED DOWN THE HILL AT A PACE THAT EVEN FOR HIM WAS UNUSUALLY RECKLESS SHORTLY AFTER ALEX REPORTED THAT HE WAS READY TO GO OVER THE HOUSE PREPARATORY
THE WINDOW OR THE DOOR WHICH WAY HAD THE FUGITIVE ESCAPED THE DOOR SEEMED MOST PROBABLE AND I HOPED IT HAD BEEN SO I COULD NOT HAVE BORNE JUST THEN TO THINK THAT IT WAS MY POOR GERTRUDE WE HAD BEEN HOUNDING THROUGH THE DARKNESS AND YET
ROSIE INSISTED SHE HAD GONE UP STAIRS TO GET A PICTURE FROM HER ROOM TO SHOW MARY ANNE A PICTURE OF A LADY MARY ANNE INTERPOSED SHE WENT UP THE SERVANTS STAIRCASE AND ALONG THE CORRIDOR TO HER ROOM WHICH LAY BETWEEN THE TRUNK ROOM AND THE UNFINISHED BALL ROOM
AND I WENT I LEFT MISTER JAMIESON AND THE DAY DETECTIVE GOING OVER EVERY INCH OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE POUNDING PROBING AND MEASURING
AND I BEAT A HASTY RETREAT TO THE LIBRARY BUT HERE AGAIN I WAS DRIVEN BACK LOUISE WAS SITTING IN A DEEP CHAIR LOOKING THE HAPPIEST I HAD EVER SEEN HER WITH HALSEY ON THE ARM OF THE CHAIR HOLDING HER CLOSE IT WAS NO PLACE FOR AN ELDERLY SPINSTER
SIT DOWN I SAID GRIMLY HAVE YOU FOUND A CLUE THAT WILL INCRIMINATE ME MISTER JAMIESON HE HAD THE GRACE TO LOOK UNCOMFORTABLE NO HE SAID IF YOU HAD KILLED MISTER ARMSTRONG YOU WOULD HAVE LEFT NO CLUES
THAT HE MIGHT MEET LOUISE DRIVING OVER THE HILLS IN HER RUNABOUT POSSIBLY HE DID MEET HER OCCASIONALLY BUT FROM HIS CONTINUED GLOOM I FELT SURE THE SITUATION BETWEEN THEM WAS UNCHANGED
WHEN THE DOOR HAD CLOSED AND LOUISE REALIZED THAT HALSEY HAD NOT COME HER EXPRESSION CHANGED FROM TENSE WATCHFULNESS TO RELIEF AND NOW AGAIN TO ABSOLUTE DESPAIR HER FACE WAS AN OPEN PAGE
I WENT UP THE WALK TO THE HOUSE WHERE A BRASS SIGN AT THE SIDE ANNOUNCED THE OFFICE AND WENT IN THE RECEPTION ROOM WAS EMPTY BUT FROM THE CONSULTING ROOM BEYOND CAME THE SOUND OF TWO VOICES NOT VERY AMICABLE
HE IS ALWAYS LATE ANY MOMENT WE MAY HEAR THE CAR COMING UP THE ROAD BUT IT DID NOT COME AFTER A HALF HOUR OF SUSPENSE LOUISE WENT OUT QUIETLY AND DID NOT COME BACK I HARDLY KNEW SHE WAS GONE
I ASKED AT LAST DIDN'T YOU SLEEP LAST NIGHT
BUT THE CATASTROPHE AT THE BANK OCCURRED SOONER THAN HE HAD EXPECTED ON THE MOMENT OF STARTING WEST AT ANDREWS STATION WHERE MISTER JAMIESON HAD LOCATED THE CAR HE READ THAT THE BANK HAD CLOSED AND GOING BACK SURRENDERED HIMSELF
HOW DID HE GET IN IF IT WAS SOME MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD WHO COULD IT HAVE BEEN AND THEN A FEELING OF HORROR ALMOST OVERWHELMED ME GERTRUDE GERTRUDE AND HER INJURED ANKLE GERTRUDE FOUND LIMPING SLOWLY UP THE DRIVE WHEN I HAD THOUGHT SHE WAS IN BED
AND YET EVERY WAY I TURNED I SEEMED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT POINTED TO SUCH A CONNECTION
IT WAS HALSEY'S FLOWING SIGNATURE TO A DOT BUT IT LACKED HALSEY'S EASE THE ONES TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE SHEET WERE MUCH BETTER THAN THE TOP ONES MISTER JAMIESON SMILED AT MY FACE HIS OLD TRICKS HE SAID
I SAID SHARPLY COME DOWN WITH US AND TURN ON ALL THE LIGHTS SHE OFFERED HER RESIGNATION AS USUAL ON THE SPOT BUT I TOOK HER BY THE ARM AND SHE CAME ALONG FINALLY SHE SWITCHED ON ALL THE LIGHTS AND POINTED TO A DOOR JUST AHEAD THAT'S THE DOOR SHE SAID SULKILY
WELL I SAID WHEN THE SILENCE BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS SEEM TO BE WARMING UP SILENCE FROM LIDDY AND A LONG SIGH IF ELIZA GOES I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER COOK
IN WHICH SHE HAD PICTURED HERSELF WALKING IN STATE TOWARDS THE ALTAR FLUSHED BY THE PURPLE LIGHT AND BLOOM OF HER OWN PASSION WITHOUT A SINGLE MISGIVING AS TO THE SEALING OF THE BOND AND FERVENTLY RECEIVING AS HER DUE
OF THE FRAGILITY TO WHICH THESE HAVE DECLINED
AND I SHOULD LIKE TO PREPARE HIM NEVER MIND DEAREST I COULD NOT VERY WELL HAVE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION I SHALL NEVER LIVE HERE AGAIN AS MUCH FOR YOUR SAKE AS FOR MINE I HAVE NEWS TO TELL YOU ON THIS VERY POINT BUT MY ALARM HAD PUT IT OUT OF MY HEAD
MISSUS CHARMOND HAD FIRST RUSHED INTO A MOOD OF INDIGNATION ON COMPREHENDING MELBURY'S STORY HOT AND COLD BY TURNS SHE HAD MURMURED LEAVE ME LEAVE ME BUT AS HE SEEMED TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF THIS HIS WORDS BEGAN TO INFLUENCE HER
SO MUCH THE BETTER I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF THIS AT ALL AND I SAY IT NOT OUT OF HARSHNESS TO HIM POOR FELLOW BUT OUT OF TENDERNESS TO YOU
WITH AN AIR WHICH MIGHT ALMOST HAVE BEEN CALLED PASSIONATE IT IS NO USE DENYING IT YOU HAVE BOUGHT A PRACTICE AT BUDMOUTH
WERE WHAT THE ACQUAINTANCE WOULD HAVE TO FEED ON SUCH ANTICIPATED GLIMPSES OF HER NOW AND THEN REALIZED THEMSELVES IN THE EVENT RENCOUNTERS OF NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE'S DURATION FREQUENTLY REPEATED WILL BUILD UP MUTUAL INTEREST EVEN AN INTIMACY IN A LONELY PLACE
SEEING THAT WINTERBORNE WAS NOTICING HIM HE LET HIS GLASS DROP WITH A CLICK UPON THE RAIL WHICH PROTECTED THE HEDGE AND WALKED AWAY IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION GILES KNEW IN A MOMENT THAT THIS MUST BE MISTER FITZPIERS
EVEN IF SHE HAD NOT TAKEN POSSESSION OF HIS HOUSE SOMETIMES SHE SUCCEEDED IN HER ATTEMPT SOMETIMES SHE DID NOT THEY STOOD BY THE GRAVE TOGETHER AND THOUGH THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN
BUT WHO KNOWS OF THE ENGAGEMENT AS YET HOW CAN BREAKING IT DISGRACE YOU MELBURY THEN BY DEGREES ADMITTED THAT HE HAD MENTIONED THE ENGAGEMENT
ON WHICH ACCOUNT AN ENDLESS SHEARING OF THE HEAVY ARMED IVY WAS NECESSARY AND A CONTINUAL LOPPING OF TREES AND SHRUBS IT WAS AN EDIFICE BUILT IN TIMES WHEN HUMAN CONSTITUTIONS WERE DAMP PROOF
PRESENTLY HIS TREAD WAS HEARD ON THE NAKED STAIRS MISTER FITZPIERS ENTERED THE SICK CHAMBER JUST AS A DOCTOR IS MORE OR LESS WONT TO DO ON SUCH OCCASIONS AND PRE EMINENTLY WHEN THE ROOM IS THAT OF A HUMBLE COTTAGER LOOKING ROUND TOWARDS THE PATIENT WITH THAT PREOCCUPIED GAZE
AND THIS WAS WHERE SHE FOUND HERSELF OVERSHADOWED WITH SUDDEN NIGHT AS IF A TORNADO HAD PASSED BY WHILE SHE SAT OR RATHER CROUCHED UNHINGED BY THE INTERVIEW LUNCH TIME CAME AND THEN THE EARLY AFTERNOON ALMOST WITHOUT HER CONSCIOUSNESS
HAVING RETURNED FROM HER WALK SHE SAT AT BREAKFAST SILENTLY WHEN HER STEP MOTHER HAD LEFT THE ROOM SHE SAID TO HER FATHER I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND THAT I SHOULD LIKE MY ENGAGEMENT TO GILES TO CONTINUE FOR THE PRESENT AT ANY RATE TILL I CAN SEE FURTHER WHAT I OUGHT TO DO
WHO WAS LOOKING OVER THE HEDGE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE WAY UPON THE FIGURE OF THE UNCONSCIOUS GRACE HE APPEARED AS A HANDSOME AND GENTLEMANLY PERSONAGE OF SIX OR EIGHT AND TWENTY AND WAS QUIZZING HER THROUGH AN EYE GLASS
GRACE MELBURY WOULD SERVE TO KEEP HIS SOUL ALIVE AND TO RELIEVE THE MONOTONY OF HIS DAYS HIS FIRST NOTION ACQUIRED FROM THE MERE SIGHT OF HER WITHOUT CONVERSE THAT OF AN IDLE AND VULGAR FLIRTATION WITH A TIMBER MERCHANT'S PRETTY DAUGHTER
FITZPIERS BESTOWED A REGULATION THOUGHT ON THE ADVANTAGEOUS MARRIAGE HE WAS BOUND TO MAKE WITH A WOMAN OF FAMILY AS GOOD AS HIS OWN AND OF PURSE MUCH LONGER BUT AS AN OBJECT OF CONTEMPLATION FOR THE PRESENT AS OBJECTIVE SPIRIT RATHER THAN CORPOREAL PRESENCE
PROBABLY HE ONLY GAVE IT TO ME IN THE ARROGANCE OF HIS SKILL TO SHOW THE GREATNESS OF HIS RESOURCES BESIDE MINE AS ELIJAH DREW DOWN FIRE FROM HEAVEN
OUT OF THE DIM MID DISTANCE BETWEEN THE MASSES OF BRUSHWOOD ON EITHER HAND AND IT ENLARGED AND TIM COULD HEAR THE BRUSHING OF FEET OVER THE TUFTS OF SOUR GRASS THE AIRY GAIT REVEALED FITZPIERS EVEN BEFORE HIS EXACT OUTLINE COULD BE SEEN
GREAT SPECTACLE TONIGHT LEAPS AND EXERCISES BY THE GREAT ARTISTS AND THE FAMOUS HORSES OF THE COMPANY FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE OF THE FAMOUS DONKEY CALLED PINOCCHIO THE STAR OF THE DANCE
WERE WORDS LIKE THESE HURRAH FOR THE LAND OF TOYS DOWN WITH ARITHMETIC NO MORE SCHOOL AS SOON AS THEY HAD SET FOOT IN THAT LAND PINOCCHIO
AND INSTEAD OF MAKING EIGHT BASKETS HE MADE SIXTEEN AFTER THAT HE WENT TO BED AND FELL ASLEEP AS HE SLEPT HE DREAMED OF HIS FAIRY BEAUTIFUL SMILING AND HAPPY WHO KISSED HIM AND SAID TO HIM BRAVO PINOCCHIO
HE TOOK THE BAG WHICH HAPPENED TO BE EMPTY AND AFTER CUTTING A BIG HOLE AT THE TOP AND TWO AT THE SIDES HE SLIPPED INTO IT AS IF IT WERE A SHIRT LIGHTLY CLAD AS HE WAS HE STARTED OUT TOWARD THE VILLAGE ALONG THE WAY HE FELT VERY UNEASY
AND HERE I AM ON HEARING THIS THE TWO DONKEYS BOWED THEIR HEADS IN SHAME
YOU ARE RIGHT LITTLE CRICKET YOU ARE MORE THAN RIGHT
BOYS WHO STOP STUDYING AND TURN THEIR BACKS
WERE ONLY THOSE WHO EITHER THROUGH AGE OR SICKNESS HAD LOST THE MEANS OF EARNING THEIR BREAD WITH THEIR OWN HANDS ALL OTHERS SHOULD WORK AND IF THEY DIDN'T AND WENT HUNGRY SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THEM JUST THEN A MAN PASSED BY
AND BENDING LOW OVER HIM HE ASKED WHO ARE YOU
THE SEA WAS AS SMOOTH AS GLASS HEY THERE BOYS WHERE'S THAT SHARK HE ASKED TURNING TO HIS PLAYMATES HE MAY HAVE GONE FOR HIS BREAKFAST SAID ONE OF THEM LAUGHING OR PERHAPS HE WENT TO BED FOR A LITTLE NAP SAID ANOTHER LAUGHING ALSO
I WONDER IF HE TOO HAS DONKEY FEVER BUT PRETENDING HE HAD SEEN NOTHING HE ASKED WITH A SMILE HOW ARE YOU MY DEAR LAMP WICK VERY WELL
HE JUMPED TO THE GROUND RAN UP TO THE DONKEY ON WHOSE BACK HE HAD BEEN RIDING
EITHER FROM PAIN OR WEAKNESS HE FELL TO THE FLOOR IN A DEAD FAINT WHEN HE REGAINED HIS SENSES HE FOUND HIMSELF STRETCHED OUT ON A SOFA AND THE FAIRY WAS SEATED NEAR HIM
WHO UNDERSTOOD THE DONKEY PERFECTLY HAW HAW HAW HAY GIVES ME A HEADACHE DO YOU PRETEND BY ANY CHANCE THAT I SHOULD FEED YOU DUCK OR CHICKEN ASKED THE MAN AGAIN
AND THIN AND HAD A WOEBEGONE LOOK ABOUT HIM LAMP WICK WAS THE LAZIEST BOY IN THE SCHOOL AND THE BIGGEST MISCHIEF MAKER BUT PINOCCHIO LOVED HIM DEARLY
AND HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SHUT AWAY IN HERE FROM THAT DAY TO THIS TWO LONG WEARY YEARS TWO YEARS MY PINOCCHIO WHICH HAVE BEEN LIKE TWO CENTURIES
YOURS FIRST THEN MINE WELL THEN
BELIEVE ME IF YOU DON'T COME YOU'LL BE SORRY
PINOCCHIO WALKED TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM BUT WHEN HE REACHED IT REMEMBERING HIS DONKEY EARS
ADMIRE HIM O SIGNORI AND ENJOY YOURSELVES I LET YOU NOW BE THE JUDGES OF MY SUCCESS AS A TEACHER OF ANIMALS BEFORE I LEAVE YOU I WISH TO STATE THAT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER PERFORMANCE TOMORROW NIGHT
HE NEEDED IT TO SHAVE WITH THEN THE PRINCE TAKING A BUNCH OF COPPER KEYS FROM HIS POCKET UNDID THE GREAT DOUBLE LOCKS AND THE DOCTOR WITH ALL HIS ANIMALS
WHO WAS TAKING A NAP LISTEN WHISPERED THE PARROT WHEN JOHN DOLITTLE'S FACE APPEARED PRINCE BUMPO IS COMING HERE TO NIGHT TO SEE YOU
THE MAN IN THERE IS UNHAPPY HE WEEPS HE HAS TAKEN CARE NOT TO BLUBBER OR SNIFFLE LEST WE SHOULD FIND OUT THAT HE IS CRYING BUT I HEARD
AND THAT'S SOMETHING PERHAPS WE CAN FIND HIM FOR YOU FIRST WE'LL GO AND HAVE TEA WITH STRAWBERRY JAM
AND BLUNDERED INTO THE PALACE GARDEN BY MISTAKE BUT COULDN'T YOU GUIDE THEM ASKED CHEE CHEE AND HE BEGAN TO SCOLD THE PARROT FOR LETTING THEM GET LOST WHILE HE WAS AWAY LOOKING FOR THE COCOANUTS
THE OWL TOO TOO WAS TO KEEP THE ACCOUNTS AND THE PIG WAS TO DO THE GARDENING THEY MADE POLYNESIA THE PARROT HOUSEKEEPER AND LAUNDRESS BECAUSE SHE WAS THE OLDEST
IT MEANT THAT SOMEBODY HAD BEEN MAKING TROUBLE AND SHE WAS THINKING OUT SOME WAY TO PUT THINGS RIGHT PEOPLE WHO MADE TROUBLE FOR POLYNESIA OR HER FRIENDS
TO BRING A BASIN THEN HE MIXED A LOT OF MEDICINES IN THE BASIN AND TOLD BUMPO TO DIP HIS FACE IN IT THE PRINCE LEANED DOWN AND PUT HIS FACE IN
LORD SAVE US CRIED THE DUCK HOW DOES IT MAKE UP ITS MIND IT DOESN'T LOOK TO ME AS THOUGH IT HAD ANY SAID JIP THE DOG
THEY WERE STILL BEING FOLLOWED BY THE KING'S MEN IF CHEE CHEE HAD KNOWN THIS HE WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE HIDDEN THEM AGAIN BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW IT ONE DAY CHEE CHEE CLIMBED UP A HIGH ROCK AND LOOKED OUT OVER THE TREE TOPS
SO THEY COULD HAVE A BIG FIRE IN THE KITCHEN MOST OF THE VEGETABLES IN THE GARDEN WERE GONE AND THE REST WERE COVERED WITH SNOW
DON'T MOVE WHATEVER YOU DO AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS PRINCE BUMPO THE KING'S SON OPENING THE GARDEN GATE HE CARRIED A BOOK OF FAIRY TALES UNDER HIS ARM
USING ONLY ONE EAR THE COLOR OF A KITTEN FROM THE WAY IT WINKS IN THE DARK WELL WELL SAID THE DOCTOR YOU SURPRISE ME THAT'S VERY INTERESTING
CHEE CHEE AND POLYNESIA ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE ABLE TO GET IT FOR THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE IT THEY EVEN GOT THE DOCTOR SOME TOBACCO ONE DAY WHEN HE HAD FINISHED WHAT HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM AND WANTED TO SMOKE
THE ANIMALS ALL WENT DOWNSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT THEIR NEW BOAT WAS LIKE INSIDE WHILE THE DOCTOR LEANT ON THE RAIL AT THE BACK OF THE SHIP WITH A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH WATCHING THE CANARY ISLANDS FADE AWAY IN THE BLUE DUSK OF THE EVENING
DOOR LOCKED AND WE ARE ALL CRAZY TO GET IN AND SEE WHAT'S INSIDE JIP SAYS IT MUST BE WHERE THE PIRATES KEPT THEIR TREASURE BUT WE
AND SO DID ALL OF THEM JOHN DOLITTLE WAS THE LAST TO CROSS AND JUST AS HE WAS GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUSHING UP TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF THEN THEY SHOOK THEIR FISTS AND YELLED WITH RAGE
AND HE SAW AT HIS FEET ONLY A PRETTY LITTLE DOG PRINCE DARLING
BUT SAID PRINCE DARLING WOULD IT NOT BE A SHAME IF I HAD AN INNOCENT GIRL PUT TO DEATH FOR CELIA HAS DONE NOTHING TO DESERVE PUNISHMENT IF PEOPLE WILL NOT DO AS YOU TELL THEM THEY OUGHT TO SUFFER FOR IT ANSWERED HIS FOSTER BROTHER BUT EVEN IF IT WERE UNJUST
FOR I'M GAUN AWA TO SEEK MY FORTUNE HER MITHER DID SAE AND THE DOCHTER GAED AWA TO AN AULD WITCH WASHERWIFE AND TELLED HER PURPOSE THE AULD WIFE BADE HER STAY THAT DAY
AND AS HE SPOKE THE QUEEN SAW THE LIONS WHICH WERE RUNNING DOWN A HILL TOWARD THEM EACH ONE HAD TWO HEADS EIGHT FEET AND FOUR ROWS OF TEETH
THE PRINCESS ASKED HER WHAT SHE WANTED FOR IT AND SHE REPLIED THAT IT WAS NOT FOR SALE EITHER FOR GOLD OR MONEY BUT THAT IF SHE COULD GET LEAVE TO GO TO THE PRINCE AND BE WITH HIM DURING THE NIGHT SHE SHOULD HAVE IT
GET THERE I MUST SAID SHE
BUT THE MORE SHE WASHED AND RUBBED THE LARGER THE SPOTS GREW
FOR SHE DOES NOT KNOW THAT IT IS YOU WHO LET THEM FALL ON IT BUT NO ONE CAN WASH THEM OUT BUT ONE BORN OF CHRISTIAN FOLK IT CANNOT BE DONE BY ONE OF A PACK OF TROLLS
AND WHENEVER SHE BEGAN THE STAINS CAME OUT PURE AND CLEAN BUT THE AULD WIFE MADE THE KNIGHT BELIEVE IT WAS HER DOCHTER HAD WASHED THE SARKS SO THE KNIGHT AND THE ELDEST DOCHTER WERE TO BE MARRIED
AND THE PEOPLE WERE FORCED TO GIVE HIM THE HAND MILL WHEN THE MAN CAME OUT AGAIN INTO THE YARD HE ASKED THE OLD WOOD CUTTER HOW HE WAS TO STOP THE HAND MILL AND WHEN HE HAD LEARNED THAT HE THANKED HIM AND SET OFF HOME WITH ALL THE SPEED HE COULD
HE MAY KNOW THAT
HOW IS THIS WHY DO YOU WASTE YOUR PITY ON THESE PRINCES WHO LOVE YOU SO MUCH THAT ALL THEIR TROUBLE WOULD BE WELL REPAID BY A SINGLE SMILE FROM YOU I SHOULD BE SORRY ANSWERED BELLISSIMA
LOOK AT ME WELL PRINCESS BEFORE YOU GIVE ME YOUR WORD SAID HE I DON'T WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME IN A HURRY OH CRIED SHE THE LIONS ARE COMING I HAVE LOOKED AT YOU ENOUGH I AM SO FRIGHTENED
AND TOOK AWAY WITH THEM ALL THE GOLD AND SILVER THAT THEY COULD CARRY AND MOVED FAR AWAY FROM THE CASTLE WHICH LAY EAST OF THE SUN AND WEST
THAT FAITHLESS PRINCESS WHO WOULD HAVE MARRIED YOU IS PROMISED TO ME SEE IF SHE HAS NOT UPON HER FINGER A RING MADE OF ONE OF MY HAIRS JUST TRY TO TAKE IT OFF
IF YOU WANT A DRINK YOU CAN DISMOUNT AND GET IT I DON'T MEAN TO BE YOUR SERVANT THEN THE PRINCESS WAS COMPELLED BY HER THIRST TO GET DOWN AND BENDING OVER THE FLOWING WATER SHE CRIED AND SAID OH HEAVEN WHAT AM I TO DO
YOU HAD BETTER BE ACCUSED OF THAT BY YOUR SUBJECTS
WAS FEELING TERRIBLY SAD AT BEING SO RAPIDLY TORN AWAY FROM HIS BELOVED PRINCESS BUT HE KNEW TOO WELL HOW POWERFUL THE FAIRY WAS TO HAVE ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING FROM HER EXCEPT BY GREAT PATIENCE AND CUNNING
AND IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY AND DANGER THAT THE MAN COULD GO THROUGH THE STREAM OF POTTAGE AND GET HOLD OF THE DOOR LATCH WHEN HE GOT THE DOOR OPEN HE DID NOT STAY LONG IN THE ROOM BUT RAN OUT AND THE HERRINGS AND POTTAGE CAME AFTER HIM
HE WOULD NOT KNOW THAT HIDDEN BEHIND THE APPLE BLOSSOMS OR AMONG THE GOLDEN CORN OR UNDER THE SHROUDING BOUGHS OF THE WOOD THERE MIGHT BE A HUMAN HEART BEATING HEAVILY WITH ANGUISH PERHAPS A YOUNG BLOOMING GIRL NOT KNOWING WHERE TO TURN FOR REFUGE FROM SWIFT ADVANCING SHAME
BLOOD ULL BEAR IT BUT I'LL NOT MAKE A MARTYR O MYSELF AND WEAR MYSELF TO SKIN AND BONE AND WORRET MYSELF AS IF I WAS A CHURN WI BUTTER A COMING IN'T FOR NO LANDLORD IN ENGLAND NOT IF HE WAS KING GEORGE HIMSELF
DINNER TIME WHEN ADAM HEARD THAT HE WAS TO DINE UPSTAIRS WITH THE LARGE TENANTS HE FELT RATHER UNCOMFORTABLE AT THE IDEA OF BEING EXALTED IN THIS WAY ABOVE HIS MOTHER AND SETH WHO WERE TO DINE IN THE CLOISTERS BELOW
OR AT A TURNING BY THE WOOD WHERE A CLEAR BROOK WAS GURGLING BELOW AND SURELY IF THERE CAME A TRAVELLER TO THIS WORLD WHO KNEW NOTHING OF THE STORY OF MAN'S LIFE UPON IT
HE WILL KNOW HE WILL SUFFER LONG AND BITTERLY HE HAS A HEART AND A CONSCIENCE I CAN'T BE ENTIRELY DECEIVED IN HIS CHARACTER I AM CONVINCED
FOR THE OLD SQUIRE'S VISITS TO HIS TENANTRY WERE RARE AND THOUGH MISSUS POYSER HAD DURING THE LAST TWELVEMONTH RECITED MANY IMAGINARY SPEECHES MEANING EVEN MORE THAN MET THE EAR
TWO NEW ROOMS HAD BEEN RUN UP TO THE OLD HOUSE FOR HIS MOTHER AND SETH WERE TO LIVE WITH THEM AFTER ALL LISBETH HAD CRIED SO PITEOUSLY AT THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING ADAM THAT HE HAD GONE TO HETTY AND ASKED HER IF FOR THE LOVE OF HIM SHE WOULD PUT UP WITH HIS MOTHER'S WAYS AND CONSENT TO LIVE WITH HER
SO LONG AS HE HAD NO OTHER PROSPECT THAN THAT OF GROWING POVERTY WITH A GROWING FAMILY AND HIS SAVINGS HAD BEEN SO CONSTANTLY DRAWN UPON BESIDES THE TERRIBLE SWEEP OF PAYING FOR SETH'S SUBSTITUTE IN THE MILITIA THAT HE HAD NOT ENOUGH MONEY BEFOREHAND TO FURNISH EVEN A SMALL COTTAGE
THAT IT WAS NOT IN THIS CASE A PURELY ABSTRACT QUESTION I DARESAY SAID MISSUS POYSER BITTERLY TURNING HER HEAD HALF WAY TOWARDS HER HUSBAND AND LOOKING AT THE VACANT ARM CHAIR I DARESAY IT'S TRUE FOR MEN
IT IS NOT MY PLACE AT PRESENT TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS I ONLY MEET YOUR GOOD HOPES CONCERNING ME BY TELLING YOU THAT MY OWN HOPES CORRESPOND TO THEM THAT WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM ME I DESIRE TO FULFIL
AND A PAPER CAP ON HIS HEAD HAS THE STRONG CONSCIENCE AND THE STRONG SENSE THE BLENDED SUSCEPTIBILITY AND SELF COMMAND OF OUR FRIEND ADAM HE WAS NOT AN AVERAGE MAN YET SUCH MEN AS HE ARE REARED HERE AND THERE IN EVERY GENERATION OF OUR PEASANT ARTISANS
THOUGH THEIR MERRIMENT IS OF A POOR BLUNDERING SORT NOT AT ALL LIKE THE MERRIMENT OF BIRDS AND PERHAPS THERE IS NO TIME IN A SUMMER'S DAY MORE CHEERING THAN WHEN THE WARMTH OF THE SUN IS JUST BEGINNING TO TRIUMPH OVER THE FRESHNESS OF THE MORNING
WOULD HAVE TOO STRONG A GRASP UPON HER
HE HAS ONE ARM OVER THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AND HE SEEMS TO BE LOOKING DOWN AT HIS CLASPED HANDS HE IS ROUSED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
FOR SHE HAD TREMBLED WHEN SHE FOUND HE WAS GOING HOME WITH THEM LEST HE SHOULD MEAN TO TELL
COMING FROM BETWEEN THE GREY HOUSES AND GRADUALLY APPROACHING THE FOOT OF THE HILL SLOWLY ADAM THOUGHT BUT DINAH WAS REALLY WALKING AT HER USUAL PACE WITH A LIGHT QUIET STEP
WITH AND TOTTY WAS WATCHING THEM WITH A PUPPYLIKE AIR OF CONTEMPLATION IT WAS BUT A SHORT TIME HARDLY TWO MONTHS SINCE ADAM HAD HAD HIS MIND FILLED WITH DELICIOUS HOPES AS HE STOOD BY HETTY'S SIDE IN THIS GARDEN
THAT HE WAS FIXED ON AS THE SECOND BROADEST MAN MARTIN POYSER THE YOUNGER AS THE BROADEST WAS TO BE PRESIDENT AND MISTER CASSON AS NEXT BROADEST WAS TO BE VICE OWING TO THIS ARRANGEMENT ADAM BEING OF COURSE
BETH TROTTED TO AND FRO BETWEEN PARLOR KITCHEN QUIET AND BUSY WHILE AMY GAVE DIRECTIONS TO EVERYONE AS SHE SAT WITH HER HANDS FOLDED AS THEY GATHERED ABOUT THE TABLE MISSUS MARCH SAID WITH A PARTICULARLY HAPPY FACE I'VE GOT A TREAT FOR YOU AFTER SUPPER
NOW AND THEN IN THIS WORKADAY WORLD THINGS DO HAPPEN IN THE DELIGHTFUL STORYBOOK FASHION
LOOK THERE LOOK THERE BETH DID LOOK AND TURNED PALE WITH DELIGHT AND SURPRISE FOR THERE STOOD A LITTLE CABINET PIANO WITH A LETTER LYING ON THE GLOSSY LID DIRECTED LIKE A SIGN BOARD TO MISS ELIZABETH MARCH
NEVER THROWN AWAY AS SHE USED THEM JO FOUND HERSELF HUMMING THE SONGS BETH USED TO HUM IMITATING BETH'S ORDERLY WAYS AND GIVING THE LITTLE TOUCHES HERE AND THERE THAT KEPT EVERYTHING FRESH AND COZY
THEIR CHEERFUL SOCIETY AND THE COMFORT HE TOOK IN THAT HUMBLE HOME OF THEIRS SO THEY SOON FORGOT THEIR PRIDE AND INTERCHANGED KINDNESSES WITHOUT STOPPING TO THINK WHICH WAS THE GREATER
HOW DEVOTED BROOKE HAD BEEN AND HOW HE WAS ALTOGETHER A MOST ESTIMABLE AND UPRIGHT YOUNG MAN WHY MISTER MARCH PAUSED A MINUTE JUST THERE AND AFTER A GLANCE AT MEG WHO WAS VIOLENTLY POKING THE FIRE
AS HER EYES WENT FROM HER HUSBAND'S LETTER TO BETH'S SMILING FACE AND HER HAND CARRESSED THE BROOCH MADE OF GRAY AND GOLDEN CHESTNUT AND DARK BROWN HAIR WHICH THE GIRLS HAD JUST FASTENED ON HER BREAST
VERY FEW LETTERS WERE WRITTEN IN THOSE HARD TIMES THAT WERE NOT TOUCHING ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH FATHERS SENT HOME
AND IF THEY DON'T CARE TO COME WHY NEVER MIND HERE A LITTLE HAND SLIPPED INTO HIS AND BETH LOOKED UP
AGAINST HER ROSY ONE FEELING AS IF HE HAD GOT HIS OWN LITTLE GRANDDAUGHTER BACK AGAIN BETH CEASED TO FEAR HIM FROM THAT MOMENT AND SAT THERE TALKING TO HIM AS COZILY AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN HIM ALL HER LIFE FOR LOVE CASTS OUT FEAR
IF MEG HAD WANTED A REWARD FOR HOURS OF PATIENT LABOR SHE RECEIVED IT IN THE HEARTY PRESSURE OF HER FATHER'S HAND AND THE APPROVING SMILE HE GAVE HER WHAT ABOUT JO
I OWE IT ALL TO YOU AND MOTHER AND BETH SAID JO MORE TOUCHED BY HER FATHER'S WORDS THAN BY ANY AMOUNT OF PRAISE FROM THE WORLD SO TAUGHT BY LOVE AND SORROW JO WROTE HER LITTLE STORIES AND SENT THEM AWAY TO MAKE FRIENDS FOR THEMSELVES
IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME SHE WENT AND KNOCKED AT THE STUDY DOOR BEFORE SHE GAVE HERSELF TIME TO THINK AND WHEN A GRUFF VOICE CALLED OUT COME IN SHE DID GO IN RIGHT UP TO MISTER LAURENCE WHO LOOKED QUITE TAKEN ABACK AND HELD OUT HER HAND SAYING
A LITTLE WOMAN AND NOT BE ROUGH AND WILD BUT DO MY DUTY HERE INSTEAD OF WANTING TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE SAID JO THINKING THAT KEEPING HER TEMPER AT HOME WAS A MUCH HARDER TASK THAN FACING A REBEL OR TWO DOWN SOUTH BETH SAID NOTHING BUT WIPED AWAY HER TEARS
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE SHUT UP FOR HOURS WITH A NERVOUS FUSSY OLD LADY WHO KEEPS YOU TROTTING IS NEVER SATISFIED AND WORRIES YOU TILL YOU'RE READY TO FLY OUT THE WINDOW OR CRY IT'S NAUGHTY TO FRET BUT I DO THINK WASHING DISHES AND KEEPING THINGS TIDY IS THE WORST WORK IN THE WORLD
YOU KNOW THE REASON MOTHER PROPOSED NOT HAVING ANY PRESENTS THIS CHRISTMAS WAS BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BE A HARD WINTER FOR EVERYONE AND SHE THINKS WE OUGHT NOT TO SPEND MONEY FOR PLEASURE WHEN OUR MEN ARE SUFFERING SO IN THE ARMY
IT MAKES ME CROSS AND MY HANDS GET SO STIFF I CAN'T PRACTICE WELL AT ALL AND BETH LOOKED AT HER ROUGH HANDS WITH A SIGH THAT ANY ONE COULD HEAR THAT TIME I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF YOU SUFFER AS I DO CRIED AMY
BUT I DON'T THINK THE LITTLE WE SHOULD SPEND WOULD DO ANY GOOD WE'VE EACH GOT A DOLLAR AND THE ARMY WOULDN'T BE MUCH HELPED BY OUR GIVING THAT
THERE NEVER WAS SUCH A CHRISTMAS DINNER AS THEY HAD THAT DAY THE FAT TURKEY WAS A SIGHT TO BEHOLD WHEN HANNAH SENT HIM UP STUFFED BROWNED AND DECORATED SO WAS THE PLUM PUDDING
WHICH THE GREAT DOG INSTANTLY SNAPPED UP AND THE YOUNG PRINCE PASSED QUIETLY ON A FEW YARDS FURTHER HE SAW A HUGE OVEN WITH A WIDE RED HOT GAPING MOUTH A WOMAN AS TALL AS A GIANT WAS LEANING OVER THE OVEN
BUT TURKEYS AND CHICKENS ARE CREATURES WHO DON'T LIKE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT AS THEMSELVES WHEN THEY SAW THE NEW COMER AND HOW HE WAS MADE AND WHEN THEY HEARD HIM CRYING TOO THEY BEGAN TO LOOK BLACK AT HIM WHAT IS IT WHAT DOES HE WANT
AND ORDERED THAT HE SHOULD BE IMPRISONED IN THE TOWER THAT WAS KEPT ON PURPOSE FOR REBELLIOUS PRINCES BUT HAD NOT BEEN USED FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS BECAUSE THERE HAD NOT BEEN ANY THE PRINCE THOUGHT ALL THE ROOMS LOOKED STRANGELY OLD FASHIONED WITH THEIR ANTIQUE FURNITURE BUT AS THERE WAS A GOOD LIBRARY HE WAS PLEASED
NOT FAR FROM THE FOUNTAIN THERE LIVED A FAMILY OF BRICKLAYERS NOW FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE THIS TIME THE FATHER IN WALKING THROUGH THE FOREST FOUND A LITTLE GIRL WHO HAD BEEN DESERTED BY THE GYPSIES HE CARRIED HER HOME TO HIS WIFE
HAPPY THOUGHT SAYS MY FRIEND RIVER SHE TAKES BAG AND BAGGAGE AND GLOU GLOU GLOU SHE TAKES HER PLACE BETWEEN FRIEND FOX AND MY FRIEND LADDER AND QUACK QUACK QUACK DRAKESTAIL IS OFF AGAIN SINGING
CRIED KING GRUMPY ANGRILY AND THE PRINCE SEEING THAT IT WAS OF NO USE TO REMONSTRATE BOWED AND RETIRED AS KING GRUMPY WAS NOT USED TO BEING CONTRADICTED IN ANYTHING HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPLEASED WITH HIS SON
IT IS A HUNDRED YEARS SINCE YOU LEFT ME TO RUST AND HE HAS OILED ME LET HIM GO IN PEACE
THEN HE WENT ALL DRESSED FOR A JOURNEY TO THE BEDSIDE OF TUBBY AND FOUND HIM SMOKING HIS FIRST PIPE FATHER HE SAID GRAVELY I HAVE COME TO BID YOU FAREWELL LAST NIGHT I DREAMED THAT I WAS WALKING IN A WOOD
AND HE SHALL GO IN PEACE ROPE O ROPE CRIED THE VOICE AGAIN TWINE YOURSELF ROUND HIS NECK AND STRANGLE HIM NO REPLIED THE ROPE YOU HAVE LEFT ME FOR MANY YEARS PAST TO FALL TO PIECES WITH THE DAMP
GO TO THE KING MASTER AND TELL HIM THAT YOU WILL PROVIDE EVERYTHING THAT'S IN YOUR LINE HOWEVER CAN I UNDERTAKE TO MAKE CLOTHES OF THAT SORT I WORK FOR QUITE COMMON FOLKS SAYS HIS MASTER GO ALONG MASTER
AND IN PASSING THROUGH MOUNTAINS VALLEYS AND TOWNS SHE ASKED A THOUSAND QUESTIONS
BEER CAKES AND TARTS ROAST LARKS AND EVEN GEESE SO THAT TUBBY COULD NOT COMPLAIN ANY MORE THAT HIS SON HAD MARRIED FAMINE
IS A WIFE THAT CAN BRING YOU BROAD RICH LANDS SO MARRY AND YOU WILL BE PERFECTLY HAPPY
I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR THEE THEN CARRY ME INTO THE OTHER WORLD HE REPLIED MAKE ME A LARGE VESSEL WITH A PARTITION IN THE MIDDLE SHE SAID CATCH ALL SORTS OF GAME
MIDNIGHT SOUNDED THE PRINCE AROSE WENT OUT OF THE CITY INTO THE FIELDS TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET THE EGGS WHICH THE MAIDENS HAD GIVEN HIM AND AS THEY HAD TAUGHT HIM TURNED THEM INTO THREE PALACES
BUT AS SOON AS HE TOUCHED IT AWAY IT FLEW TO A DISTANCE THOUGH IT WAS EVER SO BIG BIG AS A HILL AND WHEN HE HAD FLUNG THE STONE ASIDE HE SPOKE A SECOND TIME TO HIS BROTHERS SAYING WHO IS GOING INTO THE OTHER WORLD TO OVERCOME THE NORKA
AND TURNED TO GO BACK TO THE GATE BUT JUST AT THIS MOMENT THE SUN WAS DARKENED
YOU REFUSE TO HOLD TO THE TERMS OF YOUR AGREEMENT WE OURSELVES COULD REFUSE YOU ALL PAYMENT
THE DILLONS YES REALLY QUITE A DECENT YOUNG PAIR HARVEY DILLON AND HIS WIFE HE'S A DENTIST JUST COME TO TOWN THEY LIVE IN A ROOM BEHIND HIS OFFICE SAME AS I DO HERE THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH OF ANYBODY I'VE HEARD OF THEM
HE CHEWED THE STUB OF A CIGAR BUT HE WAS COURTLY TO CAROL HE STOOPED TO EXAMINE THE FURNACE FLUES HE STRAIGHTENED GLANCED DOWN AT HER AND HEMMED GOT TO FIX YOUR FURNACE NO MATTER WHAT ELSE I DO
AH HA SAYS THEY SO JIM BLAUSSER IS CLAIMING THAT GOPHER PRAIRIE IS AS GOOD A PLACE TO LIVE IN AS LONDON AND ROME AND AND ALL THE REST OF THE BIG BURGS IS HE HOW DOES THE POOR FISH KNOW SAYS THEY WELL
THE HOUSE REEKED WITH A COLORLESS STILLNESS FROM THE WINDOW SHE HEARD KENNICOTT GREETING THE WIDOW BOGART AS HE HAD ALWAYS DONE ALWAYS EVERY SNOWY EVENING GUESS THIS LL KEEP UP ALL NIGHT SHE WAITED THERE THEY WERE
IN THREE MONTHS KENNICOTT MADE SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH WAS RATHER MORE THAN FOUR TIMES AS MUCH AS SOCIETY PAID HIM FOR HEALING THE SICK IN EARLY SUMMER BEGAN A CAMPAIGN OF BOOSTING
SHE HAD SHE MEDITATED PASSED THROUGH THE NOVELTY OF SEEING THE TOWN AND MEETING PEOPLE OF SKATING AND SLIDING AND HUNTING BEA WAS COMPETENT THERE WAS NO HOUSEHOLD LABOR EXCEPT SEWING AND DARNING AND GOSSIPY ASSISTANCE TO BEA IN BED MAKING
SO HAVE I TO MINE WELL I HAVE A RIGHT TO MY LIFE AND YOU'RE IT YOU'RE MY LIFE YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF SO I'M DAMNED IF I'LL AGREE TO ALL YOUR FREAK NOTIONS BUT I WILL SAY I'VE GOT TO DEPEND ON YOU
SHE OBSERVED AS SHE REFLECTED THAT IN GOPHER PRAIRIE IT IS NOT DECENT TO CALL ON A MAN AS SHE DECIDED THAT NO REALLY SHE WOULDN'T GO IN AND AS SHE WENT IN I DIDN'T KNOW YOUR OFFICE WAS UP HERE
POINTING WITH PRIDE HARRY HAYDOCK AS CHAIRMAN INTRODUCED HONEST JIM BLAUSSER AND I AM PROUD TO SAY MY FELLOW CITIZENS THAT IN HIS BRIEF STAY HERE MISTER BLAUSSER HAS BECOME MY WARM PERSONAL FRIEND AS WELL AS MY FELLOW BOOSTER
BUT THEY PLAYED VERY SIMPLY AND THEY SAW NO REASON WHY ANYTHING WHICH EXISTS CANNOT ALSO BE ACKNOWLEDGED SHE WAS SOMETIMES SHOCKED QUITE AS SHE HAD SHOCKED GOPHER PRAIRIE BY THESE GIRLS WITH THEIR CIGARETTES AND ELFISH KNOWLEDGE
KENNICOTT DISCUSSED LAND PRICES WITH THEM HE WENT INTO THE MERITS OF THE SEVERAL SORTS OF MOTOR CARS WITH THEM HE WAS INTIMATE WITH TRAIN PORTERS AND HE INSISTED ON SEEING THE LUKE DAWSONS AT THEIR FLIMSY BUNGALOW IN PASADENA
HER COLLAR WHITE WITH FROST FROM HER BREATH SHE BOUGHT A CAN OF TOMATOES AS THOUGH IT WERE ORIENT FRUIT AND RETURNED HOME PLANNING TO SURPRISE KENNICOTT WITH AN OMELET CREOLE FOR DINNER SO BRILLIANT WAS THE SNOW GLARE
LAMB CHOPS WERE AS EXOTIC AS SHARKS FINS THE MEAT DEALERS SHIPPED THEIR BEST TO THE CITY WITH ITS HIGHER PRICES IN ALL THE SHOPS THERE WAS THE SAME LACK OF CHOICE SHE COULD NOT FIND A GLASS HEADED PICTURE NAIL IN TOWN
WAIT LL I GET TIME AND I'LL MOVE THE MOUNTAINS HERE ANY MOUNTAIN WILL BE TICKLED TO DEATH TO LOCATE HERE ONCE WE GET THE WHITE WAY IN THE TOWN WELCOMED MISTER BLAUSSER AS FULLY AS CAROL SNUBBED HIM
THEY WERE NOT AT HOME LIKE A CHILD WHO HAS NO ONE TO PLAY WITH SHE LOITERED THROUGH THE DARK HALL SHE SAW A LIGHT UNDER AN OFFICE DOOR SHE KNOCKED TO THE PERSON WHO OPENED SHE MURMURED DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE THE PERRYS ARE
ASKING A HUNDRED QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM HAD HE HAD ANY COLDS DID HE STILL DAWDLE OVER HIS OATMEAL WHAT ABOUT UNFORTUNATE MORNING INCIDENTS
THE VILLAGE VIRUS IS THE GERM WHICH IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY LIKE THE HOOK WORM IT INFECTS AMBITIOUS PEOPLE WHO STAY TOO LONG IN THE PROVINCES YOU'LL FIND IT EPIDEMIC AMONG LAWYERS AND DOCTORS AND MINISTERS AND COLLEGE BRED MERCHANTS
A BILL BY THE BYE IS THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY LOCOMOTIVE ENGINE THAT THE GENIUS OF MAN EVER PRODUCED IT WOULD KEEP ON RUNNING DURING THE LONGEST LIFETIME WITHOUT EVER ONCE STOPPING OF ITS OWN ACCORD
AS THE TRUMP CARD WAS TURNED UP AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE SECOND DEAL TWO YOUNG LADIES HURRIED INTO THE ROOM AND TOOK THEIR STATIONS ON EITHER SIDE OF MISSUS COLONEL WUGSBY'S CHAIR WHERE THEY WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL THE HAND WAS OVER
TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE PLUNGED HIMSELF AT ONCE INTO THE KING GOD BLESS HIM
WHICH WAS INSTANTANEOUSLY ANSWERED BY A POWDERED HEADED FOOTMAN IN GORGEOUS LIVERY AND OF SYMMETRICAL STATURE IS THIS HERE MISTER BANTAM'S OLD FELLER
THAT THIS BUSINESS WAS FROM THE VERY FIRST FOMENTED AND ENCOURAGED AND BROUGHT ABOUT BY THESE MEN DODSON AND FOGG THAT SHE DEEPLY REGRETS EVER HAVING BEEN THE INSTRUMENT OF ANNOYANCE OR INJURY TO YOU AND THAT SHE ENTREATS ME TO INTERCEDE WITH YOU AND IMPLORE YOUR PARDON
I AM VERY SORRY MISSUS RADDLE SAID BOB SAWYER WITH ALL IMAGINABLE HUMILITY BUT THE FACT IS THAT
JERKING SENTENCES THAT HIS NAME WAS DOWLER THAT HE WAS GOING TO BATH ON PLEASURE THAT HE WAS FORMERLY IN THE ARMY THAT HE HAD NOW SET UP IN BUSINESS AS A GENTLEMAN THAT HE LIVED UPON THE PROFITS
ACCEPTATION OF THE TERM BUT IT IS A MOST DESIRABLE SPOT NEVERTHELESS IF A MAN WISHED TO ABSTRACT HIMSELF FROM THE WORLD TO REMOVE HIMSELF FROM WITHIN THE REACH OF TEMPTATION
LOW AND GENTLE BUT VERY PLEASANT TO HEAR IN A FEMALE VOICE WHETHER IN BATH OR ELSEWHERE
A SPECIAL PLEADER FROM THE TEMPLE A SMALL EYED PEREMPTORY YOUNG GENTLEMAN HIS PUPIL WHO HAD WRITTEN A LIVELY BOOK ABOUT THE LAW OF DEMISES WITH A VAST QUANTITY OF MARGINAL NOTES AND REFERENCES AND SEVERAL OTHER EMINENT AND DISTINGUISHED PERSONAGES
MISTER BOB SAWYER THAT IT WAS TO BE CONVEYED DOWNSTAIRS AND WASHED FORTHWITH IT IS A VERY ILL WIND THAT BLOWS NOBODY ANY GOOD
SAID MISTER GUNTER BUT I'M AFRAID I SHALL BE UNDER THE NECESSITY OF ALARMING THE NEIGHBOURS BY THROWING THE PERSON WHO HAS JUST SPOKEN OUT O WINDOW
THE ONLY OBSERVABLE ALTERATIONS IN HIS APPEARANCE WERE THAT HE WORE A BRIGHTER BLUE COAT WITH A WHITE SILK LINING BLACK TIGHTS BLACK SILK STOCKINGS AND PUMPS AND A WHITE WAISTCOAT AND WAS IF POSSIBLE JUST A THOUGHT MORE SCENTED
AND AN OLD ONE BEHIND WHO WAS FAMILIAR WITH FARMING THERE WAS A CONSTANT SUCCESSION OF CHRISTIAN NAMES IN SMOCK FROCKS AND WHITE COATS WHO WERE INVITED TO HAVE A LIFT BY THE GUARD AND WHO KNEW EVERY HORSE AND HOSTLER ON THE ROAD AND OFF IT AND THERE WAS A DINNER
IF THAT WAS ALL WHEN THE WAITER WASN'T LOOKING WHICH WOULD HAVE SAVED ONE HEAD OF TEA AND THE TEA JUST AS GOOD HOWEVER THERE WAS NO HELP FOR IT AND THE TEA TRAY CAME WITH SEVEN CUPS AND SAUCERS AND BREAD AND BUTTER ON THE SAME SCALE
VERY MUCH LIKE TO HEAR THE END OF IT FOR SO FAR AS IT WENT IT WAS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE VERY BEST STORY HE HAD EVER HEARD
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT MA'AM OH I SHOULD THINK YOU WAS A DEAL TOO LIVELY AND SOUGHT AFTER TO BE CONTENT WITH THE COUNTRY MA'AM SAID LITTLE MISSUS CLUPPINS PERHAPS I AM MA'AM PERHAPS I AM SIGHED THE FIRST FLOOR LODGER
SAID THE DISCOMFITED STUDENT GLAD TO SEE YOU
HOWEVER THERE WAS PLENTY OF PORTER IN A TIN CAN AND THE CHEESE WENT A GREAT WAY FOR IT WAS VERY STRONG SO UPON THE WHOLE PERHAPS THE SUPPER WAS QUITE AS GOOD AS SUCH
IT HAPPENED THAT THE ORATOR ON THE TABLE WAS EXPATIATING ON THE MERITS OF A PICTURE WHICH HE SOUGHT TO RECOMMEND TO HIS AUDIENCE IT WAS BY NO MEANS SO SELECT OR NUMEROUS A COMPANY AS HAD ATTENDED THE PREVIOUS DAYS OF THE AUCTION
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BUSINESS MY DEAR ANSWERED THE SIRE SHAKING HIS HEAD WITH AN IMPORTANT AIR AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT ON THIS POINT EMMY WAS VERY IGNORANT
IS PLEASED SO TO HUMILIATE AND CAST DOWN THE TENDER GOOD AND WISE AND TO SET UP THE SELFISH THE FOOLISH OR THE WICKED OH BE HUMBLE MY BROTHER IN YOUR PROSPERITY BE GENTLE WITH THOSE WHO ARE LESS LUCKY IF NOT MORE DESERVING THINK WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO BE SCORNFUL
I RECOLLECT SEEING YEARS AGO AT THE PRISONS FOR IDIOTS AND MADMEN AT BICETRE NEAR PARIS A POOR WRETCH BENT DOWN UNDER THE BONDAGE OF HIS IMPRISONMENT AND HIS PERSONAL INFIRMITY
YES WE SAW HIM FATE CANNOT DEPRIVE US OF THAT OTHERS HAVE SEEN NAPOLEON SOME FEW STILL EXIST WHO HAVE BEHELD FREDERICK THE GREAT DOCTOR JOHNSON
SIR PITT INSTANTLY GUESSED THE TRUTH AND SURMISED THAT LORD STEYNE WAS THE PERSON WHOSE LIFE RAWDON WISHED TO TAKE THE COLONEL TOLD HIS SENIOR BRIEFLY AND IN BROKEN ACCENTS
MESSRS JONES AND ROBINSON'S
OR WERE REPLACED BY THE GENTLE BUT UNROMANTIC MUSIC OF THE NOSE AND SAVE WHEN THE CHURCH BELLS TOLLED THE HOUR AND THE WATCHMAN CALLED IT ALL WAS SILENT AT THE HOUSE OF JOHN SEDLEY ESQUIRE OF RUSSELL SQUARE AND THE STOCK EXCHANGE
ANNA MARIA ROAD WEST WHERE THE HOUSES LOOK LIKE BABY HOUSES WHERE THE PEOPLE LOOKING OUT OF THE FIRST FLOOR WINDOWS MUST INFALLIBLY AS YOU THINK SIT WITH THEIR FEET IN THE PARLOURS
THE FAMILIAR HOUSE OF WHICH THE LIGHTS USED TO SHINE SO CHEERFULLY AT SEVEN O'CLOCK OF WHICH THE HALL DOORS OPENED SO READILY
THOUGH I WISHED AND PRAYED FOR YOU TO COME AND THEY TOOK HIM TOO AWAY FROM ME ISN'T HE A NOBLE BOY WILLIAM BE HIS FRIEND STILL AND MINE AND HERE HER VOICE BROKE AND SHE HID HER FACE ON HIS SHOULDER
BUT I'VE NO PATIENCE WITH JOS AND HIS DANDIFIED MODESTY IT IS OUT JOSEPHING JOSEPH MY DEAR AND ALL THE WHILE THE BOY IS ONLY THINKING OF HIMSELF AND WHAT A FINE FELLOW HE IS I DOUBT MA'AM WE SHALL HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH HIM YET
AND I HAVE NO DOUBT HAD SHE BEEN ONE SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME THE CHARACTER PERFECTLY
I WAS AFRAID YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT IT I VALUE IT MORE THAN ANYTHING I HAVE IN THE WORLD SAID AMELIA DO YOU AMELIA CRIED THE MAJOR THE FACT WAS AS HE HAD BOUGHT IT HIMSELF THOUGH HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT
PUNCTUALLY AS THE SHRILL TONED BELL OF THE BLACK MARBLE STUDY CLOCK BEGAN TO CHIME NINE SIR PITT MADE HIS APPEARANCE FRESH NEAT SMUGLY SHAVED
THE LADIES NOT VERY BIG THEY WOULD HOLD THEIR TRAINS IN THEIR LAPS FINALLY THE FOUR WENT FRATERNALLY TOGETHER AND THEIR CARRIAGE PRESENTLY JOINED THE LINE OF ROYAL EQUIPAGES WHICH WAS MAKING ITS WAY DOWN PICCADILLY
I KNOW THERE IS SOME ROUGE THAT WON'T COME OFF ON A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF AND SOME SO GOOD THAT EVEN TEARS WILL NOT DISTURB IT WELL SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN TWIDDLING ROUND HIS WIFE'S CARD YOU ARE BENT ON BECOMING A FINE LADY
HE DESCRIBED THE WHOLE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AND ALL BUT ANNOUNCED THAT NAPOLEON NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE TO SAINT HELENA AT ALL BUT FOR HIM JOS SEDLEY AFTER LEAVING SAINT HELENA HE BECAME VERY GENEROUS DISPOSING OF A GREAT QUANTITY OF SHIP STORES CLARET
