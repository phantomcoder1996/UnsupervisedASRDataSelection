THE PASSAGE BETWEEN THE STALL AND THE HALL SHOULD BE FROM FIVE TO SIX FEET BROAD AT LEAST ON THE WALL OPPOSITE TO EACH STALL
THOUGH BY NO HAND UNTIMELY SNATCH'D THE LEAVES MUST DROP AWAY AND YET IT WERE A GREATER GRIEF TO WATCH IT WITHERING LEAF BY LEAF THAN SEE IT PLUCK'D TO DAY
THESE GREAT AND WISE OF THE EARTH DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF US AND THEY LOOKED UPON US WITH WONDER AND CURIOSITY AS IF WE WERE A MIRACLE IT IS TRUE THAT OUR TUNIC WAS TORN AND STAINED WITH BROWN STAINS WHICH HAD BEEN BLOOD
I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR NORMAN HE EXCLAIMED AS THAT GENTLEMAN TURNED HIS DISTRACTED FACE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME YOU ARE RUNNING AWAY HERE IS YOUR HORSE

HER BROTHER THOUGH MORE TRIUMPHANT FOR HOW COULD HE FAIL TO TRIUMPH AFTER SUCH WORDS AS ISABEL HAD SPOKEN TO HIM STILL FELT HIS DIFFICULTIES VERY SERIOUSLY SHE HAD IMBUED HIM WITH A STRONG SENSE OF HER OWN FIRMNESS
AS HE HEARD THIS PROPOSAL FOR THE WHOLESALE DESTRUCTION OF THE LEADING MEN OF CARTHAGE THE COUNCIL THUS OPENED WAS CONTINUED FOR THREE HOURS MOST OF THOSE PRESENT SPOKE BUT TO THE SURPRISE OF MALCHUS

THE WRETCHED WIFE OF THE INNOCENT MAN THUS DOOMED TO DIE FELL UNDER THE SENTENCE AS IF SHE HAD BEEN MORTALLY STRICKEN BUT SHE UTTERED NO SOUND AND SO STRONG WAS THE VOICE WITHIN HER REPRESENTING THAT IT WAS SHE OF ALL THE WORLD WHO MUST UPHOLD HIM IN HIS MISERY

HOW LONG IS IT SINCE HE WENT AWAY FOUR DAYS SIN NO ONE WOULD GIVE HIM WORK HERE AND HE'D TO GO ON TRAMP TOWARD GREENFIELD
MAN AND NATURE ARE INDISSOLUBLY JOINED THINGS ARE ULTIMATES AND THEY NEVER LOOK BEYOND THEIR SPHERE THE PRESENCE OF REASON MARS THIS FAITH
HE RESUMED HAUGHTILY LET THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID OF NOT NUMBERING MORE THAN THIRTY SAY SO THE MURMURS REDOUBLED
IS THE VIRTUE OF GRATITUDE IN A HUNDRED LITTLE WAYS MY POOR FRIENDLESS JACK HAS SHOWN ME THAT HE IS GRATEFUL TO MY MIND THAT IS REASON ENOUGH FOR TRUSTING HIM WITH MONEY
HE LEANED OUT JUST IN TIME TO SEE IT CRASH UPON A ROW OF POTTED PLANTS HIS HEART STOOD STILL HAD ANY ONE HEARD THE NOISE HE LISTENED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES IN AGONIZING SUSPENSE
TO THE CIVIL INQUIRIES WHICH THEN POURED IN AND AMONGST WHICH SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF DISTINGUISHING THE MUCH SUPERIOR SOLICITUDE OF MISTER BINGLEY'S SHE COULD NOT MAKE A VERY FAVOURABLE ANSWER JANE WAS BY NO MEANS BETTER
THE PECULIAR AND ACCIDENTAL SITUATION IN WHICH PROVIDENCE HAS PLACED THE AMERICANS TWO THE LAWS THREE THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF THE PEOPLE
WAS NOT AS HIGH AS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED
THEIR FACES SHOWED IT I CALLED AN ESCORT AND WE GALLOPED FIVE MILES TO A HILLTOP OVERLOOKING THE SEA WHERE WAS MY GREAT COMMERCE THAT
PILOTED JANE THROUGH THE CROWD OPENED THE DOOR OF A NEAT ELECTRIC BROUGHAM HELPED HER IN TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE HER AND THEY GLIDED SWIFTLY OUT INTO THE STRAND AND TURNED TOWARDS TRAFALGAR SQUARE
SHE WAS RECONCILED TO MISSUS CRAWLEY SUBSEQUENTLY BECAUSE THE LATTER BECAME WILLIAM'S MOST ARDENT ADMIRER AND CHAMPION AND IN THOSE NIGHTLY CONCLAVES IN WHICH THE TWO LADIES INDULGED AFTER THEIR PARTIES
I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT
MAMMALIA
AND YET THERE ARE PEOPLE THERE WITHIN WHO ARE SLEEPING THE TROT OF THE HORSE THE BELLS ON THE HARNESS THE WHEELS ON THE ROAD PRODUCED A GENTLE MONOTONOUS NOISE THESE THINGS ARE CHARMING WHEN ONE IS JOYOUS AND LUGUBRIOUS WHEN ONE IS SAD
PERHAPS HE WILL TAKE ME IN HIS CARRIAGE NO NO DON'T YOU COME WITH HIM UNCLE CAN'T BEAR DOCTORS HE NEVER WAS ILL IN HIS LIFE BEFORE
MY BLOOD WAS UP FOR I WAS ACTUALLY IN A DEER HUNT AND TO MY AMAZEMENT AND WILD DELIGHT I FOUND I WAS KEEPING UP WITH THE DEER I WAS GOING FASTER THAN THE MEN ON HORSEBACK HI HI I SHOUTED AND DOWN I WENT WITH ONE EYE ON THE DEER AND THE OTHER ON THE ROAD
AND CUT OFF THE LOCK AND WOVE IT INTO A COAT THAT GLITTERED LIKE SILK AND BROUGHT IT TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO TOLD HER TO CARRY IT STRAIGHT TO THE GIANT BUT THAT SHE MUST BE CAREFUL TO CRY OUT A LONG WAY OFF WHAT SHE HAD WITH HER OR ELSE HE WOULD SPRING UPON HER AND RUN HER THROUGH WITH HIS SWORD
BUT WE SOMETIMES FIND TOOLS LEFT BY THE CARPENTERS THAT WORKED ON THE HOUSE SHALL I PUT THIS IN THE TOOL CHEST SIR NEVER MIND I NEED SUCH A THING NOW AND THEN AND ILL KEEP IT HANDY VERY GOOD MISTER GLENARM
THIS AFFAIR OF APPOINTMENTS TO OFFICE IS VERY ANNOYING MORE SO TO YOU THAN TO ME DOUBTLESS I AM AS YOU KNOW OPPOSED TO REMOVALS TO MAKE PLACES FOR OUR FRIENDS BEARING THIS IN MIND
I DREAMED THAT I WAS STANDING NEAR A CROWD OF PROSPEROUS LOOKING ANGELS
THIS IS A TIME HONORED CUSTOM
THEY PRESSED ABOUT COSETTE EACH ONE VIED WITH THE REST IN SALUTING HER
INVITED BY THE MARQUIS OF STEYNE TO MEET HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
FOR I WANT THE GRASS MOWN IN ONE OF MY MEADOWS TO MORROW AT THESE WORDS THE YOUTH'S HEART SANK FOR HE HAD NEVER BEEN TRAINED EITHER AS A SMITH OR A JOINER
SAMUEL DID NOT NOTICE THIS IRREVERENT REMARK HE LOOKED AROUND THE PLACE AND SAW THAT THEY WERE ALONE THEN HE SAID VERY EARNESTLY MISTER FINNEGAN MAY I HAVE A FEW MINUTES TALK WITH YOU SURE SAID FINNEGAN PERPLEXED
WELL I HOPE HE GETS IT
WHEN I ASKED PERMISSION TO CARRY THE LACES TO MISSUS LEE IN ORDER TO LEARN WHETHER SHE COULD APPROVE MY SELECTION OR NOT HE GAVE A READY ASSENT WHEN I REMINDED HIM THAT I WAS A STRANGER
WITH WOMANLY SWIFTNESS SHE TOOK HER CUE FROM HIS MANNER AND TURNED TO SNOW AND ICE THUS AND WIDER FROM THIS ON THEY HAD DRIFTED APART WHERE WAS HIS FAULT WHO HAD BEEN TO BLAME
SHE WOULD ENCOURAGE HIM TO PERSEVERE IN THAT GAY AND DISSIPATED WAY OF LIFE TO WHICH LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD BE NECESSARY AND WHICH HAS I FEAR ALREADY PROVED BUT TOO DETRIMENTAL TO HIS HEALTH AND FORTUNE
SHE READ HIS LOVE FOR HER IN THAT LOOK BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK WHEN THEY SEPARATED RACHEL WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND SITTING DOWN IN HER ROOM SHE PUT HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND SAID TO HERSELF
WAS THAT THE ONLY OCCASION ON WHICH YOU SAW HIM YOU HAD NEVER MET HIM PREVIOUSLY IN ROME WHERE YOU RESIDED WHOM DO YOU MEAN THE MURDERED MAN WHO ELSE NO NOT THAT I AM AWARE OF AT LEAST I DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM AS A FRIEND
THE DIFFICULTY THUS PLACED IN MY WAY I DETERMINED TO OBVIATE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER I WOULD GET UP BOLDLY IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT AND DRAWING THE SLIDE ISSUE FROM THE HOUSE AND PRETEND THAT MY OBJECT WAS MERELY TO PROCURE A DRINK FROM THE CALABASH
HE WOULD HAVE CALLED OUT BUT ONLY A LITTLE SOUND CAME INTO HIS THROAT THEN HE STOOD UP AND WITH THE UNCERTAIN STEPS OF A DRUNKARD MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE ARCHWAY HE STAGGERED DOWN THE STEPS
BUT I HAVE PROMISED AT A DAY SET NEAR HAND TO DO BATTLE WITH A STRONG KNIGHT AND THEREFORE I AM LOATH TO HAVE ADO WITH YOU FOR AN IT MISFORTUNED ME HERE TO BE HURT
AND THIS EFFORT WAS DESTINED TO WEAR IT AWAY IN QUITE ANOTHER SENSE THOUGH FOR SOME TIME DICKENS FELT NO ILL EFFECTS HE GAVE READINGS NOT ONLY IN ENGLAND BUT ALSO IN SCOTLAND AND IRELAND AND EVERYWHERE HE MET WITH ENORMOUS SUCCESS
OF THAT BACKWARDNESS ON HIS PART IN ASSUMING MANHOOD WHICH HAD RENDERED HIM INCAPABLE OF MAKING HIMSELF ACCEPTABLE TO LILY BEFORE SHE HAD FALLEN INTO THE CLUTCHES OF CROSBIE
AND IN THE SAME WAY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS SOMETIMES WHEN IT PLEASES THEM AND FITS IN WITH THEIR THEORY SAY THAT POWER IS THE RESULT OF EVENTS AND SOMETIMES WHEN THEY WANT TO PROVE SOMETHING ELSE SAY THAT POWER PRODUCES EVENTS
ON THE FOLLOWING EVENING THE VIEW OF THE CONVENT TOWERS RISING AMONG THE SHADOWY WOODS REMINDED EMILY OF THE NUN WHOSE CONDITION HAD SO MUCH AFFECTED HER AND ANXIOUS TO KNOW HOW SHE WAS
AND STOPPING CRADELL AS WELL THE EXCLAMATION WAS MADE IN A DEEP ANGRY VOICE WHICH ATTRACTED THE NOTICE OF ONE OR TWO WHO WERE PASSING JOHNNY WAS VERY WRONG WRONG TO UTTER ANY CURSE VERY WRONG TO EJACULATE THAT CURSE AGAINST A HUMAN BEING
GROWING ALWAYS THE MERRIER UNTIL WHEN IT WAS NEARLY TIME FOR THEM TO GATHER THE CLOTHES TOGETHER AND GO HOME NAUSICAA THREW IT VERY HARD TO ONE OF THE OTHERS THE GIRL MISSED THE CATCH
