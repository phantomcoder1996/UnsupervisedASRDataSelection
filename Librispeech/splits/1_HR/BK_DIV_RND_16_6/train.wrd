BY GINGER I'M GLAD T SEE YEH I GIVE YEH UP FER A GONER I THOUGHT YEH WAS DEAD SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS HUSKY EMOTION IN HIS VOICE THE YOUTH FOUND THAT NOW HE COULD BARELY STAND UPON HIS FEET
BUT THERE WAS ANOTHER AND DARKER GIRL WHOM HE HAD GAZED AT STEADFASTLY AND HE THOUGHT SHE GREW DEMURE AND SAD AT SIGHT OF HIS BLUE AND BRASS
THE WHITE TOPPED WAGONS STRAINED AND STUMBLED IN THEIR EXERTIONS LIKE FAT SHEEP THE YOUTH FELT COMFORTED IN A MEASURE BY THIS SIGHT THEY WERE ALL RETREATING PERHAPS THEN HE WAS NOT SO BAD AFTER ALL
JERKED THE ROPE FRANTICALLY TO TELL THE TWISTED NEWS OF A GREAT BATTLE THIS VOICE OF THE PEOPLE REJOICING IN THE NIGHT HAD MADE HIM SHIVER IN A PROLONGED ECSTASY OF EXCITEMENT LATER HE HAD GONE DOWN TO HIS MOTHER'S ROOM AND HAD SPOKEN THUS MA
AS SHE CHANGED HER ATTITUDE HE OFTEN THOUGHT OF IT ON THE WAY TO WASHINGTON HIS SPIRIT HAD SOARED THE REGIMENT WAS FED AND CARESSED AT STATION AFTER STATION
THE BODY SEEMED TO BOUNCE A LITTLE WAY FROM THE EARTH GOD SAID THE TATTERED SOLDIER THE YOUTH HAD WATCHED SPELLBOUND THIS CEREMONY AT THE PLACE OF MEETING
HE BEGAN TO STOW VARIOUS ARTICLES SNUGLY INTO HIS KNAPSACK THE YOUTH PAUSING IN HIS NERVOUS WALK LOOKED DOWN AT THE BUSY FIGURE GOING TO BE A BATTLE SURE IS THERE JIM
THESE FACES EXPRESSED IN THEIR LINES THE DEEP STUPOR OF THE TIRED SOLDIERS THEY MADE THEM APPEAR LIKE MEN DRUNK WITH WINE THIS BIT OF FOREST MIGHT HAVE APPEARED TO AN ETHEREAL WANDERER
GOT CAREFULLY DOWN LIKE A CRONE STOOPING HE STRETCHED OUT WITH A MURMUR OF RELIEF AND COMFORT THE GROUND FELT LIKE THE SOFTEST COUCH
HIS MUSKET BOUNCED A TRIFLE FROM HIS SHOULDER AT EACH STRIDE AND MADE HIS CAP FEEL UNCERTAIN UPON HIS HEAD HE COULD HEAR THE MEN WHISPER JERKY SENTENCES SAY WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT
OF A SUDDEN HE FELT A HEAVY AND SAD HAND LAID UPON HIS SHOULDER AWAKENING FROM HIS TRANCE OF OBSERVATION HE TURNED AND BEHELD THE LOUD SOLDIER
COULD FIND EXCUSES IN THAT LONG SEETHING LANE THEY COULD RETIRE WITH PERFECT SELF RESPECT AND MAKE EXCUSES TO THE STARS HE WONDERED WHAT THOSE MEN HAD EATEN THAT THEY COULD BE IN SUCH HASTE
AND THEN WE BEGIN TO FIGHT AND THE REBS HAD AN EASY TIME OF IT DON'T TELL ME IT'S JUST LUCK I KNOW BETTER IT'S THIS DERNED OLD THE FRIEND SEEMED JADED BUT HE INTERRUPTED HIS COMRADE WITH A VOICE OF CALM CONFIDENCE
HE ADDED WITH A MIGHTY EMPHASIS ON THE LAST FOUR WORDS
THE CLANKING ARMS OF THE COLUMN NEAR HIM MADE HIM SOAR ON THE RED WINGS OF WAR FOR A FEW MOMENTS HE WAS SUBLIME HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO START FOR THE FRONT INDEED HE SAW A PICTURE OF HIMSELF
PRESENTLY THE CALM HEAD OF A FORWARD GOING COLUMN OF INFANTRY APPEARED IN THE ROAD IT CAME SWIFTLY ON AVOIDING THE OBSTRUCTIONS GAVE IT THE SINUOUS MOVEMENT OF A SERPENT THE MEN AT THE HEAD
THEY PERSISTENTLY YELLED FRESH FISH AT HIM AND WERE IN NO WISE TO BE TRUSTED HOWEVER HE PERCEIVED NOW THAT IT DID NOT GREATLY MATTER WHAT KIND OF SOLDIERS HE WAS GOING TO FIGHT SO LONG AS THEY FOUGHT WHICH FACT NO ONE DISPUTED
YOU TO TAKE THESE HERE THINGS TO MY FOLKS HE ENDED IN A QUAVERING SOB OF PITY FOR HIMSELF HE HANDED THE YOUTH A LITTLE PACKET DONE UP IN A YELLOW ENVELOPE WHY WHAT THE DEVIL BEGAN THE YOUTH AGAIN
SMOKE CLOUDS WENT SLOWLY AND INSOLENTLY ACROSS THE FIELDS LIKE OBSERVANT PHANTOMS THE DIN BECAME CRESCENDO LIKE THE ROAR OF AN ONCOMING TRAIN
THE YOUTH LOOKED KEENLY AT THE ASHEN FACE THE WIND RAISED THE TAWNY BEARD IT MOVED AS IF A HAND WERE STROKING IT HE VAGUELY DESIRED TO WALK AROUND AND AROUND THE BODY AND STARE
WELL THEN I SAYS IF WE DON'T WANT THE PICKS AND SHOVELS WHAT DO WE WANT A COUPLE OF CASE KNIVES TO DIG THE FOUNDATIONS OUT FROM UNDER THAT CABIN WITH YES
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THE TEN CENTS JIM
BUT YOU CAN GUESS CAN'T YOU IT'S JUST AS EASY WHICH CANDLE I SAYS
TOM SAID HE WAS RIGHT BEHIND JIM'S BED NOW AND WE'D DIG IN UNDER IT AND WHEN WE GOT THROUGH THERE COULDN'T NOBODY IN THE CABIN EVER KNOW THERE WAS ANY HOLE THERE BECAUSE JIM'S COUNTER PIN HUNG DOWN MOST TO THE GROUND
I SEE I WAS MISTAKENTHAT IS AFTER THE FIRST JOLT
SHE COULDN RESIS DE WIDDER SHE TRY TO GIT HER TO SAY SHE WOULDN DO IT

SO PEOPLE SAID THEY JUDGED IT WAS HIM ANYWAY SAID THIS DROWNDED MAN WAS JUST HIS SIZE AND WAS RAGGED AND HAD UNCOMMON LONG HAIR WHICH WAS ALL LIKE PAP BUT THEY COULDN'T MAKE NOTHING OUT OF THE FACE BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN IN THE WATER SO LONG IT WARN'T MUCH LIKE A FACE AT ALL
HERE I'LL LOCK SOME OF YOU INTO THE CABIN AND YOU LAY FOR EM IN THE DARK AND KILL EM WHEN THEY COME AND THE REST SCATTER AROUND A PIECE
TOM SAID THAT WHAT HE MEANT WAS WE COULD STEAL ANYTHING WE NEEDED WELL I SAYS I NEEDED THE WATERMELON BUT HE SAID I DIDN'T NEED IT TO GET OUT OF PRISON WITH
YOU'D SEE THEM DRIPPING FROM THE RAFTERS AND PLACES EVERY NOW AND THEN AND THEY GENERLY LANDED IN YOUR PLATE OR DOWN THE BACK OF YOUR NECK
AND NOTHING WAS EVER SO LOVELY AS TO HEAR THE YOUNG LADIES SING THE LAST LINK IS BROKEN AND PLAY THE BATTLE OF PRAGUE ON IT THE WALLS OF ALL THE ROOMS WAS PLASTERED AND MOST HAD CARPETS ON THE FLOORS AND THE WHOLE HOUSE WAS WHITEWASHED ON THE OUTSIDE
HE SAID THAT IN THAT WAY IT COULD BE STRUNG OUT TO AS MUCH AS EIGHTY YEAR AND WOULD BE THE BEST TIME ON RECORD AND HE SAID IT WOULD MAKE US ALL CELEBRATED THAT HAD A HAND IN IT
AND THERE WAS THE FERRYBOAT FULL OF PEOPLE FLOATING ALONG DOWN I KNOWED WHAT WAS THE MATTER NOW BOOM I SEE THE WHITE SMOKE SQUIRT OUT OF THE FERRYBOAT'S SIDE YOU SEE THEY WAS FIRING CANNON OVER THE WATER
AND I SEE WE HADN'T NO TIME TO LOSE SO TOM SAID NOW FOR THE NONNAMOUS LETTERS WHAT'S THEM I SAYS WARNINGS TO THE PEOPLE THAT SOMETHING IS UP
DOWN SHE GOES SLIP OFF YOUR CHAIN AND THERE YOU ARE NOTHING TO DO BUT HITCH YOUR ROPE LADDER TO THE BATTLEMENTS SHIN DOWN IT BREAK YOUR LEG IN THE MOATBECAUSE A ROPE LADDER IS NINETEEN FOOT TOO SHORT YOU KNOWAND
AND SO AFTER ALL OUR HARD WORK AND TROUBLE THIS ESCAPE LL GO OFF PERFECTLY FLAT WON'T AMOUNT TO NOTHINGWON'T BE NOTHING TO IT WELL AS FOR ME TOM THAT'S THE WAY I'D LIKE SHUCKS HE SAYS AND LOOKED DISGUSTED SO I SAYS
I DID WISH AUNT SALLY WOULD COME AND GET DONE WITH ME AND LICK ME IF SHE WANTED TO
WELL ABOUT THIS TIME
SOM'ERS BOVE DE TOWN BUT DEY WUZ PEOPLE A STIRRING YIT SO I HID IN DE OLE TUMBLE DOWN COOPER SHOP ON DE BANK TO WAIT FOR EVERYBODY TO GO WAY WELL I WUZ DAH ALL NIGHT
WILL YOU NOT OPEN THE GATES OF THE ENCLOSURE TO ALL COMERS I MUST BE VERY CAREFUL MASTON THE CASTING OF THE COLUMBIAD IS AN EXTREMELY DELICATE NOT TO SAY A DANGEROUS OPERATION
WITH A LUMINOUS NETWORK WHAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THESE SPARKLING RAYS WHICH SHONE ON THE PLAINS AS WELL AS ON THE RELIEFS AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY MIGHT BE ALL STARTED FROM A COMMON CENTER THE CRATER
RELATIVELY THE ORGANIZING FORCE OF MATTER HAS BEEN MUCH MORE VIOLENT IN THE INTERIOR OF THE MOON THAN IN THE INTERIOR OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE THE ACTUAL STATE OF THIS CRACKED TWISTED AND BURST DISC ABUNDANTLY PROVES THIS
THEY SPRANG FROM HIM HERSCHEL ATTRIBUTED THEIR BRILLIANCY TO CURRENTS OF LAVA CONGEALED BY THE COLD AN OPINION HOWEVER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN GENERALLY ADOPTED
ON THAT EVENING A STRANGER WHO MIGHT HAVE CHANCED TO BE IN BALTIMORE COULD NOT HAVE GAINED ADMISSION FOR LOVE OR MONEY INTO THE GREAT HALL THAT WAS RESERVED EXCLUSIVELY FOR RESIDENT OR CORRESPONDING MEMBERS NO ONE ELSE COULD POSSIBLY HAVE OBTAINED A PLACE AND
BY DAY THEY WORKED UNDER THE RAYS OF THE SCORCHING SUN BY NIGHT UNDER THE GLEAM OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT THE SOUNDS OF THE PICKS AGAINST THE ROCK THE BURSTING OF MINES THE GRINDING OF THE MACHINES
THESE ROCKETS WERE TO BURN IN SPACE IT IS TRUE BUT OXYGEN WOULD NOT FAIL THEM FOR THEY COULD SUPPLY THEMSELVES WITH IT LIKE THE LUNAR VOLCANOES THE BURNING OF WHICH HAS NEVER YET BEEN STOPPED BY THE WANT OF ATMOSPHERE ROUND THE MOON
FOR EXAMPLE ITS DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS AT THE TERRESTRIAL POLES THEY LAST SIX MONTHS SAID MICHEL AN ARGUMENT OF LITTLE VALUE SINCE THE POLES ARE NOT INHABITED LET US OBSERVE MY FRIENDS CONTINUED BARBICANE
THE CYCLOPEAN WORK HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WITH EXTRAORDINARY RAPIDITY DURING THESE EIGHT MONTHS BARBICANE NEVER QUITTED STONES HILL FOR A SINGLE INSTANT
THE MEANS OF ARRIVING THITHER ARE SIMPLE EASY CERTAIN INFALLIBLE AND THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF MY PRESENT PROPOSAL A STORM OF ACCLAMATIONS GREETED THESE WORDS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THE WHOLE AUDIENCE WHO WAS NOT OVERCOME CARRIED AWAY
AS THOUGH SHE COMPREHENDED ALL THIS AGITATION REGARDING HERSELF THE MOON SHONE FORTH WITH SERENE SPLENDOR ECLIPSING BY HER INTENSE ILLUMINATION ALL THE SURROUNDING LIGHTS THE YANKEES ALL TURNED THEIR GAZE TOWARD HER RESPLENDENT ORB KISSED THEIR HANDS
HE BUSIED HIMSELF INCESSANTLY WITH THE WELFARE AND HEALTH OF HIS WORKPEOPLE AND WAS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE IN WARDING OFF THE EPIDEMICS COMMON TO LARGE COMMUNITIES OF MEN AND SO DISASTROUS IN THOSE REGIONS OF THE GLOBE WHICH ARE EXPOSED TO THE INFLUENCES OF TROPICAL CLIMATES
THIS HOWEVER REQUIRED NOT LESS THAN SIXTY EIGHT VESSELS OF ONE THOUSAND TONS A VERITABLE FLEET WHICH QUITTING NEW YORK ON THE THIRD OF MAY ON THE TENTH OF THE SAME MONTH ASCENDED THE BAY OF ESPIRITU SANTO AND DISCHARGED THEIR CARGOES
THE PROJECTILE WAS RAPIDLY LEAVING THE MOON THE LINEAMENTS FADED AWAY FROM THE TRAVELERS EYES MOUNTAINS WERE CONFUSED IN THE DISTANCE AND OF ALL THE WONDERFUL STRANGE AND FANTASTICAL FORM OF THE EARTH'S SATELLITE THERE SOON REMAINED NOTHING
EVERY PIECE EASY TO HANDLE AS THEIR WEIGHT WAS NOW SCARCELY FELT WAS QUICKLY MOUNTED THE DIFFERENT PIECES WERE FITTED WITHOUT TROUBLE IT BEING ONLY A MATTER OF BOLTS AND SCREWS
IT IS BUT FAIR TO ADD THAT THESE YANKEES BRAVE AS THEY HAVE EVER PROVED THEMSELVES TO BE DID NOT CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THEORIES AND FORMULAE BUT THAT THEY PAID HEAVILY IN PROPRIA PERSONA FOR THEIR INVENTIONS AMONG THEM
I THINK THAT WE CAN ANSWER SAID BARBICANE BUT ACCORDING TO MY IDEA THE QUESTION OUGHT NOT TO BE PUT IN THAT FORM I ASK IT TO BE PUT DIFFERENTLY PUT IT YOUR OWN WAY REPLIED MICHEL
AGREED REPLIED NICHOLL BUT IS NOT THE MOON HABITABLE FOR CREATURES DIFFERENTLY ORGANIZED FROM OURSELVES
AND BEING AT THAT TIME NOT ONLY IN DAILY EXPECTATION OF MORLAND'S ENGAGING ISABELLA BUT LIKEWISE PRETTY WELL RESOLVED UPON MARRYING CATHERINE HIMSELF
MUST FROM SITUATION BE AT THIS TIME THE INTIMATE FRIEND AND CONFIDANTE OF HER SISTER IT IS REMARKABLE HOWEVER THAT SHE NEITHER INSISTED ON CATHERINE'S WRITING BY EVERY POST
LOOKED AT HER ANXIOUSLY CATHERINE TOOK HER PLACE AT THE TABLE AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ELEANOR SAID NO BAD NEWS FROM FULLERTON I HOPE MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS I HOPE THEY ARE NONE OF THEM ILL
AS IF BY THE ATTEMPT OF SOMEBODY TO ENTER HOLLOW MURMURS SEEMED TO CREEP ALONG THE GALLERY AND MORE THAN ONCE HER BLOOD WAS CHILLED BY THE SOUND OF DISTANT MOANS
UPON MY HONOUR SAID JAMES IN THESE PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES IT IS AS OFTEN DONE AS NOT NONSENSE HOW CAN YOU SAY SO BUT WHEN YOU MEN HAVE A POINT TO CARRY YOU NEVER STICK AT ANYTHING
AND FEW AND TRIVIAL WERE THE SENTENCES EXCHANGED WHILE THEY REMAINED UPSTAIRS CATHERINE IN BUSY AGITATION COMPLETING HER DRESS AND ELEANOR WITH MORE GOODWILL THAN EXPERIENCE INTENT UPON FILLING THE TRUNK WHEN EVERYTHING WAS DONE THEY LEFT THE ROOM
I THOUGHT HOW IT WOULD BE SAID MISSUS ALLEN NO WALK FOR ME TODAY SIGHED CATHERINE BUT PERHAPS IT MAY COME TO NOTHING OR IT MAY HOLD UP BEFORE TWELVE PERHAPS IT MAY BUT THEN MY DEAR
AND THE STEEP WOODY HILLS RISING BEHIND TO GIVE IT SHELTER WERE BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN THE LEAFLESS MONTH OF MARCH CATHERINE HAD SEEN NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT AND HER FEELINGS OF DELIGHT WERE SO STRONG THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY BETTER AUTHORITY SHE BOLDLY BURST FORTH IN WONDER AND PRAISE
ENCOURAGED HIS HORSE MADE ODD NOISES AND DROVE ON AND CATHERINE ANGRY AND VEXED AS SHE WAS HAVING NO POWER OF GETTING AWAY WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE POINT AND SUBMIT HER REPROACHES HOWEVER WERE NOT SPARED
YOU ARE TO THANK YOUR BROTHER AND ME FOR THE SCHEME IT DARTED INTO OUR HEADS AT BREAKFAST TIME I VERILY BELIEVE AT THE SAME INSTANT AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OFF TWO HOURS AGO IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THIS DETESTABLE RAIN BUT IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE NIGHTS ARE MOONLIGHT AND WE SHALL DO DELIGHTFULLY
I REMEMBER I WORE MY YELLOW GOWN WITH MY HAIR DONE UP IN BRAIDS AND WHEN I CAME INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND JOHN INTRODUCED HIM I THOUGHT I NEVER SAW ANYBODY SO HANDSOME BEFORE HERE
AND HUNG OVER HER WITH AFFECTIONATE SOLICITUDE MY DEAR CATHERINE YOU MUST NOT YOU MUST NOT INDEED WERE ELEANOR'S FIRST CONNECTED WORDS I AM QUITE WELL THIS KINDNESS DISTRACTS ME
IN SHORT SHE MADE HERSELF AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WENT DOWN WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK FIVE WITH A BROKEN HEART AND COULD SCARCELY GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ANSWER TO ELEANOR'S INQUIRY IF SHE WAS WELL
IT PROVED TO BE EXACTLY THE CASE CATHERINE HAD NEVER THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT TILL THAT MOMENT BUT UPON EXAMINING HER PURSE WAS CONVINCED THAT BUT FOR THIS KINDNESS OF HER FRIEND SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TURNED FROM THE HOUSE WITHOUT EVEN THE MEANS OF GETTING HOME
FOR MY PART I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING I LIKE SO WELL IN THE WHOLE ROOM I ASSURE YOU HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS WHISPERED CATHERINE NOT TO HAVE A SINGLE ACQUAINTANCE HERE
MISSUS HUGHES COULD NOT HAVE APPLIED TO ANY CREATURE IN THE ROOM MORE HAPPY TO OBLIGE HER THAN CATHERINE
WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
THAT THE READER MAY BE ABLE TO JUDGE IN WHAT MANNER HER ACTIONS WILL HEREAFTER TEND TO PROMOTE THE GENERAL DISTRESS OF THE WORK AND HOW SHE WILL PROBABLY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCE POOR CATHERINE TO ALL THE DESPERATE WRETCHEDNESS
THEY ARE COVERED WITH COMMON SUNSHINE DOWN HERE ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN LARKS AND REDWINGS ARE SWINGING ON THE RUSHES THE BALMY AIR IS INSTINCT WITH IMMORTAL LIFE THE WILD FLOWERS THE GRASS
DRAWN OUT IN LONG FAIRY WEBS LIKE CARDED WOOL FORMING AND DISSOLVING AS IF BY MAGIC THE WIND TWISTED THEM INTO RINGLETS AND WHIRLED THEM IN A SUCCESSION OF GRACEFUL CONVOLUTIONS LIKE THE OUTSIDE SPRAYS OF YOSEMITE FALLS IN FLOOD TIME
OUR FEEBLENESS ACCELERATING RATHER THAN DIMINISHING OUR SPEED WHEN WE HAD DESCENDED SOME THREE THOUSAND FEET THE SUNSHINE WARMED OUR BACKS AND WE BEGAN TO REVIVE AT TEN A M WE REACHED THE TIMBER AND WERE SAFE
AND HOUR AFTER HOUR PASSED BY WHILE WE EAGERLY WATCHED THE PALE LIGHT STEALING DOWN THE RIDGE TO THE HOLLOW WHERE WE LAY BUT THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF THAT WARM FLUSHING SUNRISE SPLENDOR WE SO LONG HAD HOPED FOR
HAVING SLEPT LITTLE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ASCENT AND BEING WEARY WITH CLIMBING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT WAS OVER I SLEPT LATE THEN AWAKING SUDDENLY MY EYES OPENED ON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SUBLIME SCENES I EVER ENJOYED A BOUNDLESS WILDERNESS OF STORM CLOUDS
AND FROM THE WINDOW I SAW THE GREAT WHITE SHASTA CONE CLAD IN FORESTS AND CLOUDS AND BEARING THEM LOFTILY IN THE SKY EVERYTHING SEEMED FULL AND RADIANT WITH THE FRESHNESS AND BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM OF YOUTH
AND PLENTY OF THE LANGUID MUSIC OF PIANOS MINGLING WITH THE BABEL NOISES OF COMMERCE CARRIED ON IN A HUNDRED TONGUES THE MAIN STREETS ARE CROWDED WITH BRIGHT WIDE AWAKE LAWYERS MINISTERS MERCHANTS AGENTS FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN
BUT ON GAINING THE SUMMIT WE SAW TOWARD LASSEN'S BUTTE HUNDREDS OF SQUARE MILES OF WHITE CUMULI BOILING DREAMILY IN THE SUNSHINE FAR BENEATH US AND CAUSING NO ALARM THE SLIGHT WEARINESS OF THE ASCENT WAS SOON RESTED AWAY
RAISING THE SNOW IN MAGNIFICENT DRIFTS THAT WERE DRAWN OUT IN THE FORM OF WAVERING BANNERS BLOWING IN THE SUN TOWARD THE END OF MY STAY A SUCCESSION OF SMALL CLOUDS STRUCK AGAINST THE SUMMIT ROCKS LIKE DRIFTING ICEBERGS
AFTER CAREFULLY SCANNING THE JAGGED TOWERS AND BATTLEMENTS WITH WHICH IT IS ROUGHENED I DETERMINED TO MAKE IT MY WAY THOUGH IT PRESENTED BUT A FEEBLE ADVERTISEMENT OF ITS FLORAL WEALTH THIS APPARENT BARRENNESS HOWEVER MADE NO GREAT OBJECTION JUST THEN
A PERILOUS NIGHT ON SHASTA'S SUMMIT TOWARD THE END OF SUMMER AFTER A LIGHT OPEN WINTER ONE MAY REACH THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT SHASTA WITHOUT PASSING OVER MUCH SNOW BY KEEPING ON THE CREST OF A LONG NARROW RIDGE
ON THE CONTRARY THEY IMPRESSED ONE AS BEING LASTING ADDITIONS TO THE LANDSCAPE THE WEATHER OF THE SPRINGTIME AND SUMMER THROUGHOUT THE SIERRA IN GENERAL IS USUALLY VARIED BY SLIGHT LOCAL RAINS AND DUSTINGS OF SNOW
HALF PRAIRIE LEVEL AND FERTILE AND BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSIFIED WITH OUTSTANDING GROVES OF SPRUCES AND ALDERS AND RICH FLOWERY FRINGES OF SPIRAEA AND WILD ROSES THE RIVER MEANDERING DEEP AND TRANQUIL THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT
JEROME MADE A DASH FROM THE SHELTER OF THE LAVA BLOCK AND BEGAN FORCING HIS WAY BACK AGAINST THE WIND TO THE HOT SPRINGS WAVERING AND STRUGGLING TO RESIST BEING CARRIED AWAY AS IF HE WERE FORDING A RAPID STREAM
THE STORM BEGAN IN SERIOUS EARNEST AT FIRST THE CLIFFS WERE BEATEN WITH HAIL EVERY STONE OF WHICH AS FAR AS I COULD SEE WAS REGULAR IN FORM SIX SIDED PYRAMIDS WITH ROUNDED BASE RICH AND SUMPTUOUS LOOKING AND FASHIONED WITH LOVING CARE
EVEN SHOULD HIS SUFFERINGS ADMIT OF SUCH A THING ACCORDINGLY WHEN DURING THE LONG DREARY WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WE ROUSED FROM A STATE OF HALF CONSCIOUSNESS WE CALLED EACH OTHER BY NAME IN A FRIGHTENED STARTLED WAY
AND SAW IT COVERED WITH FLOWERS AND FRUIT SHE STOPPED AND BEGAN TO GATHER SOME OF THE ORANGES AND THEN PUTTING DOWN HER BASKET SHE SAT DOWN TO EAT THEM BUT WHEN IT WAS TIME TO GO ON AGAIN THE BASKET HAD DISAPPEARED AND THOUGH SHE LOOKED EVERYWHERE
AND YOU ALONE CAN SAVE ME I WILL SAY THAT I WANT TO SEE WHAT MY BRIDE CAN DO AND BID HER WASH THE SHIRT
TAKE CARE THAT YOU ARE NOT DROWNED IN THE POTTAGE HE CRIED AS HE WENT BY THEM AS IF MISCHIEF WERE AT HIS HEELS DOWN TO WHERE HIS BROTHER DWELT THEN HE BEGGED HIM FOR GOD'S SAKE TO TAKE THE MILL BACK AGAIN AND THAT IN AN INSTANT
HE POURED OUT THE DRINK AND SAE MADE THE AULD WIFE THINK HE HAD DRUNK IT THEY A WENT TO BED AGAIN
SO SHE DID THIS AND JOURNEYED TO THE SOUTH WIND NEITHER WAS SHE VERY LONG ON THE WAY WHEN THEY HAD GOT THERE THE WEST WIND ASKED HIM IF HE COULD TELL HER THE WAY TO THE CASTLE
SAID SHE OPENING THE WINDOW IT CAN'T BE BOUGHT EITHER FOR GOLD OR MONEY ANSWERED THE GIRL
BEHIND THEM CAME A TALL OLD WOMAN WHOSE UGLINESS WAS EVEN MORE SURPRISING THAN HER EXTREME OLD AGE SHE WORE A RUFF OF BLACK TAFFETA A RED VELVET HOOD AND A FARTHINGALE ALL IN RAGS
WHO CAME FORWARD AND THREW OUT A PLATE OF MOST DELICIOUS LOOKING FOOD THEN THE WINDOW WAS SHUT AGAIN AND PRINCE DARLING WHO HAD NOT HAD ANYTHING TO EAT ALL DAY THOUGHT HE MIGHT AS WELL TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING SOMETHING
AND THE MAN TAKING HIM UP IN HIS ARMS CARRIED HIM TO THE KING
AT SEVEN YEARS END SHE GOT HER IRON SHOON CLAMB THE GLASSY HILL AND CHANCED TO COME TO THE AULD WASHERWIFE'S HABITATION THERE SHE WAS TELLED
HER MOTHER WANTED TO TALK WITH HER ALONE IN HER OWN CHAMBER BUT SHE REMEMBERED WHAT THE WHITE BEAR HAD SAID AND WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT GO WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY CAN BE SAID AT ANY TIME
BUT JUST AS THEY PASSED SHE LOOKED UP AND SAW THE KING AND THE FAIRY OF THE DESERT NOW THE FAIRY WAS SO CLEVER THAT SHE COULD NOT ONLY SEEM BEAUTIFUL TO THE KING BUT EVEN THE POOR PRINCESS THOUGHT HER THE MOST LOVELY BEING SHE HAD EVER SEEN
AT LAST HE SAID WELL IF YOU WON'T TELL ME CONFIDE YOUR TROUBLE TO THE IRON STOVE THERE AND HE WENT AWAY THEN SHE CREPT TO THE STOVE AND BEGAN TO SOB AND CRY AND TO POUR OUT HER POOR LITTLE HEART AND SAID HERE I SIT DESERTED BY ALL THE WORLD
FOR ALL DAY LONG SHE HAD TO GO ABOUT ALONE AND SHE DID SO WISH TO GO HOME TO HER FATHER AND MOTHER AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS THEN THE WHITE BEAR ASKED WHAT IT WAS THAT SHE WANTED AND SHE TOLD HIM
AND RISING INTO THE AIR HE FLEW ROUND AND ROUND THE HOUSE UNTIL HE SAW AN OPEN WINDOW BUT HE SEARCHED THROUGH EVERY ROOM IN VAIN
SAID THE PRINCESS FOR SHE HAD MADE UP HER MIND WHAT SHE WOULD DO
I ACCEPT THE GIFT THAT YOU MAKE ME OF YOURSELF AND I WILL LOVE YOU ALWAYS
FOR HE KNEW HIS DOOR HAD BEEN TIGHTLY SHUT AND HE COULD NOT THINK HOW SHE HAD GOT IN BUT SHE SAID TO HIM I AM THE FAIRY TRUTH I WAS PASSING THROUGH THE WOOD WHEN YOU WERE OUT HUNTING
WHICH SHONE WITH GOLD AND SILVER LIKEWISE A LARGE HALL IN WHICH THERE WAS A WELL SPREAD TABLE AND IT WAS SO MAGNIFICENT
AS BEFORE NO MATTER ON WHAT CONDITIONS I READ THESE URGENT AND REPEATED LETTERS AND TORE THEM IN PIECES WITHOUT TELLING MARGUERITE WHAT THEY CONTAINED AND WITHOUT ADVISING HER TO SEE THE OLD MAN AGAIN
YOU REPROACH ME MARGUERITE IT ISN'T GENEROUS
AND COULD NOT FORGIVE HER HE SAID TO HER SOMEWHAT CRUELLY THAT HE WAS TIRED OF PAYING FOR THE FOLLIES OF A WOMAN WHO COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HIM TREATED WITH RESPECT UNDER HIS OWN ROOF AND HE WENT AWAY IN GREAT INDIGNATION
WELL SAID MARGUERITE WELL I HAVE SEEN THE DUKE WHAT DID HE SAY THAT HE WOULD GLADLY FORGIVE YOU IN REGARD TO THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE
WITH A DISINTERESTED LOVE YES DO YOU BELIEVE THAT I HAD MADE THIS LOVE THE HOPE THE DREAM THE FORGIVENESS OF MY LIFE IMPLICITLY
AND AT THIRTY THEY COULD AFFORD THE LUXURY OF HAVING A LOVER FOR NOTHING IF I HAD ONLY KNOWN ONCE WHAT I KNOW NOW IN SHORT SAY NOTHING TO MARGUERITE AND BRING HER BACK TO PARIS YOU HAVE LIVED WITH HER ALONE FOR FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS
MARGUERITE ROSE FROM TABLE AND JOINED THE DUKE IN THE NEXT ROOM WHERE SHE TRIED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO INDUCE HIM TO FORGET THE INCIDENT BUT THE OLD MAN WOUNDED IN HIS DIGNITY BORE HER A GRUDGE FOR IT
YES YOU WOULD STAY BY ME ALL DAY YES AND EVEN ALL NIGHT AS LONG AS I DID NOT WEARY YOU AND WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT DEVOTION
WHETHER THIS MUTUAL LOVE MEANS HAPPINESS TO HIM AND REDEMPTION TO YOU
IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I RECEIVED THIS NOTE
AND THE SORT OF LIFE SHE LEADS ISN'T EXACTLY THE THING TO CURE HER SHE HAS TAKEN TO HER BED
COVERING HER HANDS WITH TEARS IN MY JOY AT BEING THUS LOVED MY LIFE IS YOURS MARGUERITE YOU NEED THIS MAN NO LONGER AM I NOT HERE SHALL I EVER LEAVE YOU AND CAN I EVER REPAY YOU FOR THE HAPPINESS THAT YOU GIVE ME
HOWEVER MARGUERITE'S PLEASURE IN SEEING HER FRIENDS WAS A LITTLE MODERATED WHEN SHE SAW THE EXPENSE WHICH THAT PLEASURE ENTAILED AND ESPECIALLY THE NECESSITY SHE WAS SOMETIMES IN OF ASKING ME FOR MONEY THE DUKE
PRUDENCE RANG THE PIANO WAS SILENT A WOMAN WHO LOOKED MORE LIKE A COMPANION THAN A SERVANT OPENED THE DOOR WE WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM AND FROM THAT TO THE BOUDOIR WHICH WAS THEN JUST AS YOU HAVE SEEN IT SINCE
HIDDEN UNDER THE APPARENT CALM OF THE INVALID BUT ARMAND ON THE CONTRARY SEEMED TO DELIGHT IN SPEAKING OF HER NOT AS FORMERLY WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES BUT WITH A SWEET SMILE WHICH REASSURED ME AS TO THE STATE OF HIS MIND
WOULD YOU NOT SUFFER ON SEEING THE HINDRANCES SET BY YOUR LOVE TO YOUR LOVER'S LIFE HINDRANCES FOR WHICH YOU WOULD BE POWERLESS TO CONSOLE HIM IF WITH AGE THOUGHTS OF AMBITION SHOULD SUCCEED TO DREAMS OF LOVE THINK OVER ALL THAT MADAME YOU LOVE ARMAND
AND YET I OFTEN FOUND HER SAD WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO GET ANY EXPLANATION OF THE REASON EXCEPT SOME PHYSICAL CAUSE FEARING THAT SO MONOTONOUS A LIFE WAS BEGINNING TO WEARY HER I PROPOSED RETURNING TO PARIS
SINCE THAT DAY HE HAD NEVER BEEN HEARD OF IN VAIN MARGUERITE DISMISSED HER GUESTS CHANGED HER WAY OF LIFE THE DUKE WAS NOT TO BE HEARD OF I WAS THE GAINER IN SO
HE COULD ONLY SAY WHAT WE HAVE ALL SAID HOW SINCERELY HOW SORROWFULLY WE ALL KNOW THE COMMON WORD GOOD BY THE COMMON WISH GOD BLESS YOU AT THAT LAST MOMENT
COULD TAKE PLACE BETWEEN MISTER AND MISSUS LINLEY IN THIS INTERVAL MISSUS PRESTY SAW HER OPPORTUNITY OF SETTING LINLEY'S AUTHORITY AT DEFIANCE BY ROUSING THE FIRST JEALOUS SUSPICION
WHEN SHE HAD RETURNED THAT MORNING FROM HER WALK HE HAD BEEN KIND AND CONSIDERATE HE HAD LISTENED TO HER LITTLE STORY OF THE RELICS OF HER FATHER FOUND IN THE GARRET AS IF HER INTERESTS WERE HIS INTERESTS THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING TO DISAPPOINT HER NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF
THE LARGEST NATURE THE LONGEST LOVE MISSUS PRESTY WAITED IN THE GARDEN TO BE JOINED BY HER DAUGHTER AND CAPTAIN BENNYDECK AND WAITED IN VAIN IT WAS PAST HER GRANDCHILD'S BEDTIME
AND HE ACCORDINGLY RETIRED ON SECOND THOUGHTS HOWEVER HE HAD RETURNED IN THE HOPE IN THE HOPE HERBERT INTERPOSED OF SEEING MISSUS PRESTY'S DAUGHTER THAT WAS ONE OF MY MOTIVES
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCOUNT FOR RANDAL'S SILENCE WILL YOU THINK ME VERY INQUISITIVE HERBERT RESUMED IF I ASK WHETHER MY BROTHER APPROVES OF YOUR MARRIAGE
I TOLD HER WHO I WAS AH IT WAS A MELANCHOLY MEETING FOR BOTH OF US
IN CLEANING OUT THE GARRET WHAT DO YOU THINK THE LANDLADY FOUND TRY TO GUESS ANYTHING TO PLEASE HER
TO MAKE A COMPLICATED STATEMENT IN FEW WORDS PERMIT ME TO SEIZE THE POINTS IN THE LATE MISTER PRESTY'S STYLE AND TO PUT THEM IN THE STRONGEST LIGHT THIS PLACE RANDAL IS ALWAYS FULL AND WE DIDN'T WRITE LONG ENOUGH BEFOREHAND TO SECURE ROOMS
WITHOUT AN OBJECT TO HINDER ITS PASSAGE AT ANY POINT OF THE COMPASS THE LONELY DRAB COLORED ROAD THAT LED TO THE NEAREST TOWN OFFERED TO VISITORS TAKING AIRINGS
QUIET AS IT WAS HER TONE LEFT HIM NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO TREAT HER BRUTALLY OR TO REPLY STILL LOOKING OUT AT THE STREET HE SAID YES FREE TO MARRY IF YOU LIKE SHE PERSISTED
HE ADMITTED THAT SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT STILL SPEAKING ABSENTLY STILL THINKING OF THE DIVORCE SHE LAID THE PACKET OF LETTERS AND THE POOR RELICS OF THE OLD SONG BOOK ON THE TABLE AND BENT OVER HIM TENDERLY
MISSUS PRESTY RESUMED ON HER RETURN THAT LETTER THAT FATAL LETTER TO THE CAPTAIN HAS JUSTIFIED MY WORST FEARS WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME ARE WE TO DO NOW WE ARE TO LEAVE THIS HOTEL
INDUSTRY AND GOOD TEMPER WHILE SHE HAS BEEN GOVERNESS TO MY CHILD SHE LEAVES HER SITUATION IN MY SERVICE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH TESTIFY TO HER SENSE OF DUTY AND HER SENSE OF GRATITUDE HAVE I SAID SHE ASKED
MORE CHANGES MET ME THE MOMENT I OPENED THE DOOR CHANGES FOR THE BETTER MY DEAR IT COULDN'T HAVE CHANGED FOR THE WORSE
HE MUST CERTAINLY HAVE HEARD A MAN'S VOICE RAISED IN ANGER WHEN HE APPROACHED THE DOOR AND HE WAS NOW OBSERVING THAT MAN WITH AN AIR OF CURIOSITY WHICH WAS ALREADY ASSUMING THE APPEARANCE OF DISTRUST
EXCEPT IN THOUGHT MISSUS LINLEY RESUMED DO YOU TELL ME THAT ON YOUR WORD OF HONOR ON MY WORD OF HONOR SO FAR HIS WIFE WAS SATISFIED MY GOVERNESS SHE SAID
ONE BY ONE THE TOURISTS DISAPPEARED UNDER THE PORTICO OF THE FRONT DOOR THE EMPTY CARRIAGE WAS DRIVEN AWAY NEXT TO WATER THE HORSES AT THE VILLAGE INN SOLITUDE WAS ALL SHE COULD SEE FROM THE WINDOWS
WHO HAD SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AND WAS REPUTED TO OWN SOME OF THE BIGGEST HOTELS IN FRANCE SUCH A PERSON AS HIS FATHER AGREED WAS WELL WORTH KNOWING EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THE CHARMING COMPANION HE WAS
HIS CHEEKBONES ALSO GAVE HIS FACE A HARSH CHARACTER BUT THERE WAS NO HARSHNESS IN THE EYES WHICH LOOKING AT THE WORLD FROM UNDER THEIR TAWNY EYEBROWS GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF A MAN EVER ALERT TO GREET A REDEEMING INSTINCT IN OTHERS
SHE HAD THE NOTIONS OF A COMMON WOMAN BUT WASN'T MARIA GLAD WHEN THE WOMEN HAD FINISHED THEIR TEA AND THE COOK AND THE DUMMY HAD BEGUN TO CLEAR AWAY THE TEA THINGS
ASKED HER WAS IT WEDDING CAKE SHE WANTED TO BUY THAT MADE MARIA BLUSH AND SMILE AT THE YOUNG LADY BUT THE YOUNG LADY TOOK IT ALL VERY SERIOUSLY AND FINALLY CUT A THICK SLICE OF PLUMCAKE
VILLONA WAS ENTERTAINING ALSO A BRILLIANT PIANIST BUT UNFORTUNATELY VERY POOR THE CAR RAN ON MERRILY WITH ITS CARGO OF HILARIOUS YOUTH THE TWO COUSINS SAT ON THE FRONT SEAT JIMMY AND HIS HUNGARIAN FRIEND SAT BEHIND
HE WAS STILL DISCOMPOSED BY THE GIRL'S BITTER AND SUDDEN RETORT IT HAD CAST A GLOOM OVER HIM WHICH HE TRIED TO DISPEL BY ARRANGING HIS CUFFS AND THE BOWS OF HIS TIE HE THEN TOOK FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET A LITTLE PAPER AND GLANCED AT THE HEADINGS HE HAD MADE FOR HIS SPEECH
HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD REGRET IN THE MORNING BUT AT PRESENT HE WAS GLAD OF THE REST GLAD OF THE DARK STUPOR THAT WOULD COVER UP HIS FOLLY HE LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND RESTED HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS HANDS COUNTING THE BEATS OF HIS TEMPLES
EACH BLUE CAR THEREFORE RECEIVED A DOUBLE MEASURE OF WELCOME AS IT TOPPED THE CREST OF THE HILL AND EACH CHEER OF WELCOME WAS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH SMILES AND NODS BY THOSE IN THE CAR IN ONE OF THESE TRIMLY BUILT CARS WAS A PARTY OF FOUR YOUNG MEN WHOSE SPIRITS SEEMED TO BE AT PRESENT
THEY WERE WALKING OUT OF KINGSTOWN STATION THE TICKET COLLECTOR SALUTED JIMMY HE WAS AN OLD MAN FINE NIGHT SIR IT WAS A SERENE SUMMER NIGHT THE HARBOUR LAY LIKE A DARKENED MIRROR AT THEIR FEET
SHE WENT INTO THE WOMEN'S ROOM AND BEGAN TO PULL THE BIG BELL IN A FEW MINUTES THE WOMEN BEGAN TO COME IN BY TWOS AND THREES WIPING THEIR STEAMING HANDS IN THEIR PETTICOATS
TWO GENTLEMEN AND THREE LADIES MARY JANE O HERE'S MISTER BERGIN AND MISTER KERRIGAN SAID MARY JANE MISTER KERRIGAN WILL YOU TAKE MISS POWER MISS FURLONG MAY I GET YOU A PARTNER MISTER BERGIN O THAT'LL JUST DO NOW THREE LADIES MARY JANE
WERE TO GO HOME TO DRESS THE CAR STEERED OUT SLOWLY FOR GRAFTON STREET WHILE THE TWO YOUNG MEN PUSHED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE KNOT OF GAZERS THEY WALKED NORTHWARD WITH A CURIOUS FEELING OF DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE EXERCISE WHILE THE CITY HUNG ITS PALE GLOBES OF LIGHT ABOVE THEM
RIVIERE NOT WHOLLY INGENUOUSLY UNDERTOOK TO EXPLAIN TO JIMMY THE TRIUMPH OF THE FRENCH MECHANICIANS THE RESONANT VOICE OF THE HUNGARIAN WAS ABOUT TO PREVAIL IN RIDICULE OF THE SPURIOUS LUTES OF THE ROMANTIC PAINTERS
AND FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THERE MUST BE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE HE KEPT AWAY FROM CONCERTS LEST HE SHOULD MEET HER
AND THIS TIME SHE GOT THE PRAYER BOOK AFTER THAT MISSUS DONNELLY PLAYED MISS MC CLOUD'S REEL FOR THE CHILDREN AND JOE MADE MARIA TAKE A GLASS OF WINE SOON THEY WERE ALL QUITE MERRY AGAIN
MARIA SUPERINTENDED THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BARMBRACK AND SAW THAT EVERY WOMAN GOT HER FOUR SLICES THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF LAUGHING AND JOKING DURING THE MEAL
GAVE MUSIC LESSONS TO BEGINNERS ON THE OLD SQUARE PIANO IN THE BACK ROOM LILY THE CARETAKER'S DAUGHTER DID HOUSEMAID'S WORK FOR THEM THOUGH THEIR LIFE WAS MODEST THEY BELIEVED IN EATING WELL THE BEST OF EVERYTHING DIAMOND BONE SIRLOINS
WE DARE NOT MEET SECRETLY YOU KNOW THE CITY IS FULL OF SPIES AND DOUBTLESS THE MOVEMENTS OF ALL KNOWN TO BE HOSTILE TO HANNO AND HIS PARTY ARE WATCHED THEREFORE WE THOUGHT IT BEST TO MEET HERE
AND THE TWO AT ONCE SET OUT FOR HIS HOUSE
I AM NEITHER A CONDEMNER NOR A SPURNER MALCHUS SAID INDIGNANTLY I SAY ONLY THAT I BELIEVE YOU WORSHIP THEM WRONGFULLY THAT YOU DO THEM INJUSTICE I SAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE GODS WHO RULE THE WORLD
WE OLD MEN BOW MORE RESIGNEDLY TO THE DECREES OF THE GODS YOU KNOW THE SAYING THOSE WHOM THE GODS WOULD DESTROY THEY FIRST STRIKE WITH MADNESS CARTHAGE IS SUCH
AT LAST THE DAY FOR EMBARKATION ARRIVED AND THE TROOPS DEFILED THROUGH THE TEMPLE OF MOLOCH WHERE SACRIFICES WERE OFFERED UP FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE ENTERPRISE MALCHUS UNDER THE PRETENSE THAT SOMETHING WAS NOT READY AT THE LAST MOMENT LINGERED AT HOME
THE HORSES STANDING NEAR SUFFER MORE THE LATHER STANDS ON THEIR SIDES THEIR FLANKS HEAVE AND FROM TIME TO TIME THEY STRETCH OUT THEIR EXTENDED NOSTRILS IN THE DIRECTION FROM WHICH WHEN THE SUN SINKS A LITTLE LOWER
MALCHUS THE SON OF HAMILCAR THE LEADER OF THE EXPEDITION IN THE DESERT HAD BEEN FROM HIS EARLY CHILDHOOD TRAINED BY HIS FATHER IN THE USE OF ARMS WHEN HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD HAMILCAR HAD TAKEN HIM WITH HIM ON A CAMPAIGN IN SPAIN
THIRTY LARGE MERCHANT SHIPS WERE HIRED TO CONVEY THE TROOPS WHO NUMBERED SIX THOUSAND THESE WERE PRINCIPALLY LIBYAN FOOTMEN THE MAIN BODY WITH THE NUMIDIAN HORSE
SO THESE YOUNG ARISTOCRATS OF CARTHAGE SMILED AND JESTED THOUGH WELL AWARE THAT THEY WERE RISKING THEIR LIVES NO DECISION WAS ARRIVED AT FOR THIS COULD ONLY BE DECIDED UPON AT A SPECIAL MEETING
FORMED BY THE GAULS AND SPANIARDS THESE RESISTED WITH GREAT OBSTINACY THE PRINCIPES WHO FORMED THE SECOND LINE OF THE ROMAN INFANTRY CAME FORWARD AND JOINED THE SPEARMEN AND EVEN THE TRIARII PRESSED FORWARD AND JOINED IN THE FIGHT
BUT REMAINED ON BOARD UNTIL THE VESSEL SAILED AS HE FEARED THAT HE MIGHT AGAIN BE RECOGNIZED BY SOME OF THE SAILORS OF THE CARTHAGINIAN VESSELS IN PORT THE WEATHER WAS FAIR AND THE WIND LIGHT AND ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER SAILING
AND HANNO AND HIS PARTY HAVE LAVISHED MONEY SO FREELY AMONG THE LOWER CLASSES THAT THERE IS NO HOPE OF STIRRING THE POPULACE UP TO DECLARE AGAINST HIM I THINK IT WOULD BE IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE DANGEROUS WERE WE AS YOU PROPOSE
RECEIVED HIM MOST WARMLY AND LISTENED IN ASTONISHMENT TO HIS STORY OF WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM MALCHUS THEN EXPLAINED THE MISSION WITH WHICH HANNIBAL HAD CHARGED HIM AND ASKED HIS ADVICE AS TO THE BEST COURSE TO BE ADOPTED MANON WAS SILENT FOR A TIME
THEREFORE NO HARM CAN YET HAVE BEEN DONE STRIKE MY NAME OFF THE LIST AND FORGET THAT I HAVE BEEN WITH YOU YOU HAVE MY OATH THAT I WILL SAY NOUGHT OF ANYTHING THAT I HAVE HEARD YOU CAN WELL MAKE SOME EXCUSE TO YOUR COMRADES
AT THE SAME TIME HE LAUNCHED HIS HEAVY CAVALRY AGAINST THE ROMAN HORSE THE LATTER WERE INSTANTLY OVERTHROWN AND WERE DRIVEN FROM THE FIELD WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER EMILIUS HIMSELF WAS WOUNDED BUT MANAGED TO JOIN THE INFANTRY
OR TO LAUNCH THEIR TRIREMES TO ENGAGE THE FLEETS OF ROME THE SEVERE CHECKS WHICH THEY HAD LATELY SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE NEWLY FORMED ROMAN NAVY AND THE CERTAINTY THAT ERE LONG A TREMENDOUS STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE TWO POWERS MUST TAKE PLACE
THE RESPECTIVE MERITS OF THE REIGNING BEAUTIES OF CARTHAGE AND OTHER SIMILAR TOPICS AND MALCHUS WHO WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE SERIOUS NATURE OF THE SECRET CONSPIRACY WHICH HE HAD JUST SWORN TO AID COULD NOT HELP BEING SURPRISED AT THE CARELESS GAIETY OF THE YOUNG MEN
DROP THAT WORK AND GO WHERE YOU PLEASE BUT REMEMBER THIS NEVER WILL YOU BE CALLED A DORCAS NEVER WILL YOU BE ABLE TO SEW AND PROVIDE GARMENTS FOR THE POOR IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO TELL THEM YOU LOVE THEM YOU MUST SHOW IT BY YOUR WORKS AND THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO LEARN TO BE USEFUL TO THEM
AS SHE SLIGHTLY RAISED THE SICK GIRL'S HEAD DEAREST MARGUERITE SAID OUR TEACHER HERE ARE PAULA AND LISITA
BUT WE CONTINUED OUR WAR LIKE ACTIVITIES BY KICKING EACH OTHER UNDER THE TABLE LOUIS WAS TEN YEARS OLD AND I WAS NINE AS HE WAS OLDER AND A BOY
ROSA WHO WAS NOW EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WAS STUDYING IN THE CITY SHE WAS STILL THE SAME STUDIOUS FAITHFUL AND SINCERE IN ALL THAT SHE DID HER QUIET RESERVED MANNER CAUSED SOME PEOPLE TO CALL HER PROUD BUT THOSE WHO KNEW HER BETTER LOVED HER AND KNEW SHE COULD BE DEPENDED ON IN TIME OF TROUBLE
AND I SAID TO MYSELF THAT I WOULD HONOR THE MEMORY OF MY MISTRESS BY DOING ALWAYS THAT WHICH I KNEW SHE WOULD HAVE APPROVED OF AND NOW SIR TAKE THIS LITTLE ORPHAN AS YOU KNOW YOUR GOOD WIFE WOULD HAVE DONE
AND NOW MADEMOISELLE WILL YOU CONTINUE TO HELP ME AS YOU PROMISED TO DO YES OF COURSE SAID PAULA
AND AS I LOOKED AT HER TALL WELL DEVELOPED FIGURE OUTLINED AGAINST THE WINDOW I LAUGHED AT MY FOOLISH FEARS
EDUCATION MY FATHER SMILED A BIT SADLY YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND IT TERESA YES YES I UNDERSTAND HALF OF IT AND I THINK I CAN GUESS AT THE OTHER HALF DO YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU OFFERED LOUIS
THAT'S WHY I'VE COME BACK TO LOOK FOR YOU
VIBRANT WITH EMOTION HAD MOVED US ALL TO THE DEPTHS OF OUR SOULS YOU ARE A VALIANT WOMAN WITH A GREAT HEART MY FATHER SAID AS HE TOOK HER HAND I WILL WRITE THIS VERY NIGHT AND ASK THEM TO SEND THE GIRL TO US AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AND ALSO TO WAIT FOR THE LITTLE ORPHAN TO BE PLACED IN HIS CARE
PAULA GOT DOWN FROM HER CHAIR AND STOOD IN FRONT OF HER NOW COOLING CUP OF HOT MILK SHE PLACED HER HANDS TOGETHER CLOSING HER EYES AND BENDING HER HEAD A LITTLE SHE SAID SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY IN A LOW VOICE
I DECLARE SAID ROSA THINK OF THE BRETON
AND AS I LOOKED AT THAT PURE BEAUTIFUL FACE WITH THE EYES CLOSED IN PRAYER WITH ITS FRAME OF GLORIOUS HAIR I KNEW THAT NEVER HAD I SEEN ANYTHING SO LOVELY AS THIS CHILD COMPANION OF MINE JUST BUDDING INTO WOMANHOOD
I SAID CONFUSED THAT SHE SHOULD FIND ME STILL SEATED ON THE EDGE OF MY BED LOST IN MY OWN REFLECTIONS PAULA SUDDENLY WENT TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED OUT OH LISITA SHE EXCLAIMED
THE BRETON KNOWS VERY WELL THAT WHEN YOUR FATHER GOT RID OF HIM HE WELL DESERVED IT SAID TERESA AS SHE ADJUSTED HER SPECTACLES AND SETTLED DOWN TO HER KNITTING MY FATHER DID NOT KEEP HIM LONG
PAULA ARRIVES FOR NEARLY A WEEK I COULDN'T THINK OF ANOTHER THING BUT THE COMING OF PAULA MY FATHER HAD GONE TO PARIS HE WOULD BE THERE SOME DAYS TO ARRANGE CERTAIN IMPORTANT MATTERS OF BUSINESS IN CONNECTION WITH HIS FACTORY
THE FOOD WHICH WE RECEIVE O LORD
THE YEARS PASSED SWIFTLY WITHOUT BRINGING ANY GREAT CHANGES IN OUR QUIET LIFE OUR GRANDPARENTS HAD AGED A BIT AND TERESA WAS NOT QUITE AS ACTIVE AS FORMERLY WHILE A FEW WRINKLES HAD GATHERED ON OUR FATHER'S FOREHEAD BUT ALL THIS HAD COME SO SLOWLY THAT THE CHANGE WAS HARDLY NOTICED
FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE VILLAGERS THEMSELVES EACH ONE HAD A SMALL SPACE FOR FLOWERS IN FRONT AND A VEGETABLE GARDEN BEHIND OF COURSE
SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN CONTINUED IN HER QUIET SIMPLE WAY
FISH OF ALL SHAPES AND COLORS WERE FLAPPING IN SHALLOW TUBS OF SEA WATER THERE WERE PILES OF STOCKINGS MUFFETEES AND COMFORTERS IN VIVID BLUE AND RED WORSTED AND COARSE POTTERY GLAZED IN BRIGHT PATTERNS
WHY HAD SHE SAID SHE WOULD GO WHAT WAS ALL EUROPE IN COMPARISON WITH WHAT SHE WAS LEAVING LIFE WAS SO SHORT HOW COULD SHE TAKE A WHOLE YEAR OUT OF IT TO SPEND AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE SHE LOVED BEST
WHEN SHE WOKE THE SUN WAS STRUGGLING THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND SHE FELT BETTER THE STEWARDESS OPENED THE PORT HOLE TO FRESHEN THE AIR AND HELPED HER TO WASH HER FACE AND SMOOTH HER TANGLED HAIR THEN SHE PRODUCED A LITTLE BASIN OF GRUEL AND A TRIANGULAR BIT OF TOAST
AND SEND ME A CUP OF TEA I DON'T LIKE TO LEAVE YOU ALONE KATY WAS BEGINNING BUT AT THAT MOMENT A NICE OLD WOMAN WHO SEEMED TO BE IN CHARGE OF THE WAITING ROOM APPEARED AND WITH A FLOOD OF FRENCH WHICH NONE OF THEM COULD FOLLOW
WELL THERE'S ANOTHER VOYAGE OVER AND DONE WITH THANK GOD AND MY MARY IS WHERE SHE WAS IT'S A LOAD TAKEN FROM MY MIND THE MOON HAD RISEN AND WAS SHINING SOFTLY ON THE RIVER AS THE CROWDED TENDER LANDED THE PASSENGERS FROM THE SPARTACUS
OH WELL FOR THE FISHERMAN'S CHILD ON THE SANDY BEACH AT HIS PLAY
MOVING TO AND FRO AND ALL THIS CROWD WERE TALKING ALL AT ONCE AND ALL WERE TALKING FRENCH
AND AWAY THEY DROVE UP THE SOLIDLY PAVED STREETS TO THE HOTEL WHERE THEY WERE TO PASS THE NIGHT IT WAS TOO LATE TO SEE OR DO ANYTHING BUT ENJOY THE SENSE OF BEING ON FIRM LAND ONCE MORE HOW LOVELY IT WILL BE TO SLEEP IN A BED THAT DOESN'T TIP OR ROLL FROM SIDE TO SIDE SAID MISSUS ASHE
THIS IS THE FIRST SHOP I HAVE BEEN INTO AND THE FIRST THING I HAVE REALLY WANTED TO BUY AND VERY LIKELY AS WE GO ON I SHALL SEE THINGS I LIKE BETTER AND WANT MORE SO IT WOULD BE FOOLISH TO DO IT NO I WON'T
AND COMPETENT TO GRAPPLE WITH ANYTHING OR ANYBODY THERE WAS THE QUEER OLD GENTLEMAN WHO HAD CROSSED ELEVEN TIMES BEFORE AND HAD ADVICE AND EXPERIENCE TO SPARE FOR ANY ONE WHO WOULD LISTEN TO THEM AND THE OTHER GENTLEMAN NOT SO OLD BUT EVEN MORE QUEER
AND WHEN THE WORDS CAME THEY WERE STRANGLED WITH SOBS
AND SUCH A GOOD BREAKFAST AS WAS PRESENTLY BROUGHT TO THEM DELICIOUS COFFEE IN BOWL LIKE CUPS CRISP ROLLS AND RUSKS
THERE THE CAPTAIN FOUND HER AND DREW NEAR FOR A TALK CAPTAIN BRYCE WAS EXACTLY THE KIND OF SEA CAPTAIN THAT IS FOUND IN STORY BOOKS BUT NOT ALWAYS IN REAL LIFE HE WAS STOUT AND GRIZZLED AND BROWN AND KIND
SO SHE WENT CALMLY ON WITH HER DARNING DRAWING THE RAVELLING WITH WHICH HER NEEDLE WAS THREADED CAREFULLY IN AND OUT AND TAKING NICE EVEN STITCHES WITHOUT ONE PROPHETIC THRILL OR TREMOR WHILE IF ONLY SHE COULD HAVE LOOKED THROUGH THE TWO WALLS
SHE STOOD SO VERY STILL AND SAID SO VERY LITTLE THAT A BYSTANDER NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT HAVE DUBBED HER UNFEELING WHILE THE FACT WAS THAT SHE WAS FEELING TOO MUCH
LOOKING LONGINGLY BACKWARD TOWARD THE QUARTER WHERE THE UNITED STATES WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AND FISHING OUT OF HER PORT HOLE WITH A CROOKED PIN IN HOPES OF GRAPPLING THE SUBMARINE CABLE AND SENDING A MESSAGE TO HER FAMILY TO COME OUT AT ONCE AND TAKE HER HOME
LONGWOOD SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH MY DEAREST CHILD YOUR NOTE MADE ME DANCE WITH DELIGHT
AND EUROPE BECKONED MORE BRILLIANTLY NOW THAT THEY WERE FAIRLY EMBARKED ON THEIR JOURNEY
THAT LOVELACE HIMSELF WOULD HARDLY THINK ME WORTH ADDRESSING WERE HE TO KNOW THIS WOULD BE MY RESOLUTION THESE MEN MY DEAR
MY CONFINEMENT HANNA'S DISMISSION AND MORE OF THE RESENTMENTS AND RESOLUTIONS OF MY FATHER UNCLES AND BROTHER THAN I CAN POSSIBLY KNOW AND ALMOST AS SOON AS THE THINGS HAPPEN WHICH HE TELLS ME OF
WRINGS THE HEART BUT IT GOES AGAINST ONE TO HEAR ANY BODY ELSE TAKE THE SAME LIBERTIES THEN YOU HAVE SO VERY STRONG A MANNER OF EXPRESSION WHERE YOU TAKE A DISTASTE THAT WHEN PASSION HAS SUBDUED AND I COME
TO MISS HOWE HARLOWE PLACE
ANTONY HARLOWE THIRD BROTHER
TO WHAT YOU THINK IT OWING THAT YOUR MAN SEEMS SO CAREFUL TO ADORN THAT SELF ADORNED PERSON OF HIS YET SO MANAGES THAT ONE CANNOT FOR ONE'S HEART THINK HIM A COXCOMB
TO ENGAGE MY HONOUR TO HIM NEVER TO HAVE MISTER SOLMES I THINK I MAY FAIRLY PROMISE HIM THAT I WILL NOT HE BEGS
AND IS BUT JUST GONE AWAY HE IS ALL IMPATIENCE AND RESENTMENT AT THE TREATMENT YOU MEET WITH AND FULL OF APPREHENSIONS TOO THAT THEY WILL CARRY THEIR POINT WITH YOU
AS THE PRIME OF YOUTH AND HIS NATURAL GAIETY WILL PERMIT AND BY HIS EARLY MORNING HOURS
THAT IS INDEED INDISPENSABLE IN FRIENDSHIP I KNEW YOUR MOTHER WOULD BE FOR IMPLICIT OBEDIENCE IN A CHILD I AM SORRY MY CASE IS SO CIRCUMSTANCED THAT I CANNOT COMPLY IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO DO SO IF I COULD
FOR COMMON THINGS WHEN YOU COME WITH YOUR CURIOSITIES WITH YOUR CONDITIONAL LIKINGS AND WITH YOUR PRUDE ENCIES MIND HOW I SPELL THE WORD IN A CASE THAT WITH
IF I HAVE DESERVED REFLECTION
I HAVE BOTH YOUR LETTERS AT ONCE IT IS VERY UNHAPPY MY DEAR SINCE YOUR FRIENDS WILL HAVE YOU MARRY THAT A PERSON OF YOUR MERIT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY A SUCCESSION OF WORTHLESS CREATURES WHO HAVE NOTHING BUT THEIR PRESUMPTION FOR THEIR EXCUSE
AS FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD OF HIM BUT A FEW HOURS AGO
AND FINDING NEITHER MISTER SYMMES NOR MISTER MULLINS WILL BE ACCEPTED HAS PROPOSED MISTER WYERLEY ONCE MORE
HAS PUT IT TO MY MOTHER WHETHER IT WERE NOT BEST TO PREVAIL UPON MY BROTHER TO TAKE A TURN TO HIS YORKSHIRE ESTATE WHICH HE WAS INTENDING TO DO BEFORE
AND HENCE SIR RETORTED I YOUR UNBROTHERLY REFLECTIONS UPON ME WELL BUT YOU OBSERVE MISS SAID HE
AS YOU AND I HAVE HEARD HIM SAY HE FREQUENTLY DOES THAT IS THE STRANGE THING

OF THE GRAND DUKE AT A CONFERENCE OF THE GERMAN DIET THE PROPHECY OF THE SCOTCH SOOTHSAYER WAS FULFILLED SARAH WEDDED THE HEIR TO A THRONE WITHOUT QUENCHING THE FIRE OF HIS LOVE
AND WHO DID NOT ARRIVE UNTIL THE SECOND DAY AND WHEN RESTORED TO HEALTH AT LAST THE COLONIST NOT DESIRING TO BLUSH BEFORE HIS OWN SLAVE WHOSE PRESENCE CONSTANTLY OPPRESSED HIM WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS EXCESSIVE NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT
WHY MY DEAR FELLOW
TOO SELF POSSESSED TO COMPROMISE AND BETRAY HERSELF IN THE EYES OF THE COURT AND RODOLPH PERCEIVING THE NECESSITY OF DISSIMULATION IMITATED SARAH'S PRUDENCE THE LOVERS SECRET WAS CAREFULLY PRESERVED FOR SOME TIME NOR WAS IT
IN A SHORT TIME I SHALL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO CONCEAL MY SITUATION AND I OUGHT NOT TO BLUSH AT THAT OF WHICH I AM ON THE CONTRARY SO PROUD AND WOULD DESIRE OPENLY TO ACKNOWLEDGE
WHO HAVE ASSUMED THEIR PRETENDED MISSIONS WITH SO SERIOUS AN AIR TO TELL THE TRUTH I HAVE NEVER CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD WHY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS ATTACHED THE COLONEL AND THE COUNT TO HIS PRIVATE PERSON
HE ADDED WITH PERFECT SINCERITY HE AND HIS SISTER WOULD INSTANTLY LEAVE GEROLSTEIN SARAH PARTICIPATED IN THE PRINCE'S AFFECTION BUT PREFERRING DEATH TO DISHONOUR SHE COULD ONLY BE THE WIFE OF HIS HIGHNESS
AND DANGERS APPEARED IMPOSSIBLE TO POLIDORI AND HE FRANKLY TOLD SEYTON THE REASONS WHY THE GRAND DUKE WOULD NEVER SUBMIT TO SUCH A UNION SEYTON AGREED IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE REASONS BUT PROPOSED
AND THE PLANTER PAID ALL THE EXPENSES OF HIS COURSE OF STUDY
WHO WITH A MERRY FACE AND ACTIVE HANDS WAS VERY BUSY IN COMPLETING THE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE SHOP
WAS A METISSE ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE NAMED CECILY AND FOR THIS POOR GIRL MISTER WILLIS TOOK A FANCY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HIS ADVANCES WERE REPULSED AND OBSTINATELY RESISTED CECILY WAS IN LOVE
THIS CONDUCT SEEMS LESS STUPID BUT QUITE AS FEROCIOUS A SHORT TIME AFTER THESE EVENTS WE ARRIVED IN AMERICA MONSEIGNEUR HAD FREIGHTED A DANISH BRIG AT SAINT THOMAS'S AND WE VISITED INCOGNITO ALL THE SETTLEMENTS OF THE AMERICAN COAST
AND TO SEE HIM WALK WITH BOTH HIS HANDS IN THE POCKETS OF HIS LONG AND WARM COAT OF DARK BROADCLOTH HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR ONE OF THE MOST INOFFENSIVE CITIZENS IN THE WORLD FAITH MY FINE FELLOW
FOR HE MUST AFTER THAT HAVE REQUIRED THE MAN'S SERVICES PRECISELY SO FOR THAT VERY DAY THE VERY FURY INTO WHICH HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF JOINED TO THE DRUNKENNESS IN WHICH THE BRUTE INDULGED EVERY EVENING
CERTAIN THAT HE COULD NOT MISTAKE SARAH'S VIEWS THE DOCTOR WAS SORELY PERPLEXED HE HAD THREE WAYS BEFORE HIM TO INFORM THE GRAND DUKE OF THE MATRIMONIAL PROJECT TO OPEN RODOLPH'S EYES
WITH MUCH CAPABILITY WHEN HE GOES TO THE FAIRS TO PURCHASE CATTLE I SAY AGAIN IS HE NOT A LUCKY FELLOW
HIS FOREFINGER POINTED TO THE ROOF AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE COLONIST SAID IN A SOLEMN TONE GOD AND THEN WAS SILENT GOD REPLIED THE PLANTER BURSTING INTO A LOUD FIT OF LAUGHTER TELL HIM THEN
SO NOW MY DEAR MURPHY FAREWELL TILL THE EVENING TILL THE EVENING ADIEU HAVE YOU THEN FORGOTTEN THAT THERE IS A GRAND BALL AT THE EMBASSY AND THAT HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS WILL BE PRESENT
THEN ONE OF THESE GREAT ANIMALS STOOPED OVER AND PICKED HIM UP AND HELD HIM BOTTOM SIDE UPPERMOST AND RAPPED ON THAT SIDE WHICH WAS FLAT AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WHICH WAS ROUNDED AND STARED AT HIM WITH TWO GREAT EYES
BUT I JUST MAKE THE BEST OF IT HOW ASKED THE GREEN BROWN FROG LOOKING A LITTLE MORE CHEERFUL
IF THEY HAD ALL BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME AGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN PLEASANTER FOR THE OLDEST FIVE WOULD PUT ON AIRS AND CALL THE OTHERS THE CHILDREN AND THE NEXT FIVE WOULD CALL THE YOUNGEST FIVE
I WISH I MIGHT HELP YOU SOME TIME
IT QUITE STARTLED HER TO FIND HIM SITTING SO CLOSE TO HER
AND COULD DRAW IN HIS HEAD AND LEGS AND TAIL WHEN HE WANTED TO HIS SHELLS WERE GRAY QUITE THE COLOR OF A CLAY BANK AND HIS HEAD WAS LARGER THAN THOSE OF THE MUD TURTLES
NOW THE BIGGEST FROG SWALLOWED A GREAT DEAL OF AIR FILLED THE SACS ON EACH SIDE OF HIS NECK WITH IT OPENED HIS BIG MOUTH AND SANG CROAKILY
AND HE RAISED ONE OF HIS HIND FEET TO SHOW WHERE HE MEANT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL HINDFOOT THICKLY PADDED AND WITH SHORT PARTLY WEBBED TOES AND NO HAIR AT ALL GROWING BETWEEN THEM THE CLAWS WERE SHORT SHARP AND CURVED
OR IF THEY HAD BEEN FLYING BY NIGHT AS THEY USUALLY DID THEY WOULD HAVE STAYED NEARER THE GROUND AND THEIR LEADER WOULD HAVE TRUMPETED LOUDLY TO LET HIS FOLLOWERS KNOW WHICH WAY HE WAS GOING THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TRUMPETED BUT MORE SOFTLY TO TELL HIM THAT THEY WERE COMING AFTER
AND FLY AROUND IN THE SUNSHINE TO FIND FOOD FOR THEIR CHILDREN AH YES SAID THE MUD TURTLE HOW THEY MUST WISH FOR SHELLS HUMPH SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHAT FOR TO FLY WITH
LET THEM COME IN SWIMMING WITH THEIR CHILDREN IF THEY ARE WARM AND TIRED THE WATER ADDER LAUGHED IN HER SNAKY WAY AND SHOWED HER SHARP TEETH I HAVE HEARD SHE SAID THAT WHEN THE WILD DUCKS BRING THEIR CHILDREN HERE TO SWIM
WELL HOW WILL YOU PUT MY TAIL IN PLACE OF YOURS ASKED THE BACHELOR I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED THE YOUNG MINK BUT YOU ARE SO WISE THAT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW SOME WAY
IT IS SO IN THE WAY BESIDES THERE IS SUCH A STYLE ABOUT HAVING ONE'S HIND FEET DIFFERENT HE SPOKE JUST LOUD ENOUGH FOR THE BIGGEST FROG TO HEAR ANY ONE WOULD KNOW FROM THIS REMARK
AND THERE IS ONLY ONE OF ME SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE TO HIMSELF I MUST HAVE SOMEBODY TO HELP ME
AND BY MISTAKE CALLED HIM THE QUICK SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
TWO NAUGHTY YOUNG WATER BOATMEN HAD SWUM QUIETLY UP ON THEIR BACKS AND STUNG THE TURTLES ON THEIR TAILS THEN THEY SWAM AWAY PUSHING THEMSELVES QUICKLY THROUGH THE WATER WITH SWIFT STROKES OF THEIR HAIRY OAR LEGS
THE FIRST YEAR I HAD ONLY A FEW CHILDREN THE NEXT YEAR I HAD MORE AND SO IT HAS GONE EVERY YEAR A FEW MORE CHILDREN THAN THE YEAR BEFORE UNTIL NOW I NEVER KNOW QUITE HOW MANY I DO HAVE BUT THERE IS ALWAYS ONE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
YES SAID A FINE OLD FELLOW WHO WAS FLOATING NEAR HER A ROW OF THEIR MOTHERS HE WAS A TURTLE WHOM SHE HAD NEVER LIKED VERY WELL BUT NOW SHE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE WAS RATHER AGREEABLE AFTER ALL
