FOR HE HAD AN INKLING OF WHAT WAS TO BE THE TERMINATION OF THE AFFAIR AND DID NOT CONCEAL HIS TRIUMPH MISTER GALLOWAY ALSO WAS OF THEIR PARTY MISTER GALLOWAY WAS THE FIRST WITNESS PUT FORTH BY MISTER BUTTERBY THE LATTER GENTLEMAN WAS IN HIGH FEATHER ALSO
SHE HAD ASKED TO SEE HIS FIDDLE SO IN THE MORNING HE TOOK IT AND WENT DOWN WITH IT TO THE PARK THE CHURCH WAS WITHIN THE GROUNDS AND HE HAD TO PASS IT AS HE WENT BY HE HEARD THE ROLL OF THE ORGAN AND THE STRAINS OF THE CHOIR
THAT HE HAD GIVEN UP HUNTING BUT HE STILL KEPT TWO HORSES FOR SUCH RIDING AS MAY BE HAD IN OR ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF LONDON HE CONTINUED TO RIDE TO THE END OF HIS LIFE HE LIKED THE EXERCISE AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE DISTRESSED HIM NOT TO HAVE HAD A HORSE IN HIS STABLE
I KNOW OF ONE SAID HE WHERE A MAN LIKE YOU IS WANTED A FELLOW THAT CAN PLEASE EVERYBODY WHAT IS THE SALARY I ASKED YOU HAD BETTER CALL AND MAKE YOUR OWN TERMS HE REPLIED YOU CAN MENTION MY NAME IF YOU LIKE THANKS SAID I BUT WHERE IS IT
BUT IT HAD NOT MADE HIM CALLOUS OR INDIFFERENT TO THE BEAUTIES OF LIFE NO ONE WOULD EVER HAVE CALLED HIM EMOTIONAL OR PRONE TO ENTHUSIASMS OF A WEAK KIND AND YET HE WAS BY NO MEANS HARD OF HEART HE HAD QUIET FANCIES OF HIS OWN ABOUT PEOPLE AND THINGS
WHEN THREATENED BY FOREIGN FOES OR BY THE DESTROYING OCEAN FLOODS JACQUELINE'S EYE CAUGHT THE FLUTTER OF THE BROAD BANNER OF THE HOUSE OF ARKELL THAT WAVED OVER THE REBEL CAMP AGAIN SHE SAW THE BRAVE LAD WHO ALONE OF ALL HER FATHER'S COURT SAVE SHE
THAT YOU HAVE NEVER DROPPED UPON HIM PREVIOUSLY INTERRUPTED MISTER CARLYLE NO SIR AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I HAVE BEEN AFRAID TO SHOW MYSELF IN THOSE LATTER PARTS OF THE TOWN FEARING I MIGHT MEET WITH SOME ONE I USED TO KNOW AT HOME
THEY ARE SO MUCH OF THOSE BOUNDLESS OCEANS OF ETERNITY AND IMMENSITY AS IS SET OUT AND DISTINGUISHED FROM THE REST AS IT WERE BY LANDMARKS AND SO ARE MADE USE OF TO DENOTE THE POSITION OF FINITE REAL BEINGS IN RESPECT ONE TO ANOTHER
WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF TAKING ORDERS YET IT WAS RATHER DISGRACEFUL THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE BETTER OFF SO AN APPEAL WAS MADE TO THE GOVERNMENT ON HIS BEHALF AND LORD HALIFAX WHO EXERTED HIMSELF STRONGLY IN THE MATTER SUCCEEDING TO OFFICE ON THE ACCESSION OF WILLIAM THE THIRD
SHE REACHED THE SHOP OF A PASTRY COOK ENTERED IT AND FELL RATHER THAN SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR WHICH STOOD BEFORE THE COUNTER AS SHE LIFTED THE CREAKING LATCH OF THE DOOR A YOUNG WOMAN WHO WAS AT WORK ON A PIECE OF EMBROIDERY
THAT EVEN MISSUS THORNTON WAS WHITE WITH FEAR AS SHE PRECEDED HIM INTO THE ROOM HE CAME IN A LITTLE FLUSHED BUT HIS EYES GLEAMING AS IN ANSWER TO THE TRUMPET CALL OF DANGER AND WITH A PROUD LOOK OF DEFIANCE ON HIS FACE THAT MADE HIM A NOBLE IF NOT A HANDSOME MAN
AND THERE IS PHILIP ON HORSEBACK THE CARRIAGE HAD TURNED ON TO THE STREET AND EVEN AS GRACE SPOKE A CURVE IN THE ROAD HID IT FROM VIEW PHILIP EVIDENTLY GIVING SOME DIRECTIONS TO THE NEGROES WHO WERE LOADING TRUNKS AND BOXES INTO A CART
AND OF OUR ALL GOING UP THE NILE AND SEEING WONDERS WITHOUT BEING SANGUINE AS TO MY OWN PART IN THOSE BRIGHT PLANS I FELT THAT HERBERT'S WAY WAS CLEARING FAST AND THAT OLD BILL BARLEY HAD BUT TO STICK TO HIS PEPPER AND RUM
FIRST I HAD THE BEST BUFFALO HORSE THAT EVER MADE A TRACK AND SECOND I WAS USING WHAT WAS KNOWN AT THAT TIME AS THE NEEDLE GUN A BREECH LOADING SPRINGFIELD RIFLE CALIBRE FIFTY IT WAS MY FAVORITE OLD LUCRETIA WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE NOTICE OF THE READER
PERHAPS I'LL BE ABLE TO SAVE CAP'N BILL MYSELF BUT IF I DON'T IT'S ALL UP TO YOU BUTTON BRIGHT I'LL DO MY BEST HE PROMISED AND HERE KEEP MY POLLY TILL I COME BACK ADDED TROT GIVING HIM THE BIRD I CAN'T TAKE IT WITH ME
SO I LAID TRAPS FOR HER I LET HER ALSO PERCEIVE WHITHER MY OWN PLANS WERE DRIFTING SHE DID NOT WAIT TO LET ME FORCE HER HAND SHE MADE UP HER MIND ONE DAY I FOUND LEFT CARELESSLY ON THE DRAWING ROOM TABLE A VOLUME OF SAINT SIMON
IN THE IMMEDIATE NEARNESS OF THE GOLD ALL ELSE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN HIS PROMISE AND THE DOCTOR'S WARNING WERE BOTH THINGS OF THE PAST AND I COULD NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOPED TO SEIZE UPON THE TREASURE FIND AND BOARD THE HISPANIOLA UNDER COVER OF NIGHT
ASKED THE GIRL RAISING HER VOICE IF YOU ATTEMPT TO GIVE THE ALARM HE ANSWERED AS TRUE AS GOD'S ABOVE US YOU WILL FEEL MY HAND ON YOUR THROAT IT'S MY TURN NOW MISS AND I AM NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH WILL YOU HAVE ME FOR YOUR HUSBAND YES OR NO
MANY WOULD BE REJOICING WHO ARE SAD IF GOD HAD THEE SURRENDERED TO THE EMA THE FIRST TIME THAT THOU CAMEST TO THE CITY BUT IT BEHOVED THE MUTILATED STONE WHICH GUARDS THE BRIDGE THAT FLORENCE SHOULD PROVIDE A VICTIM IN HER LATEST HOUR OF PEACE
AND HE WONDERED WITH A THRILL OF AMUSEMENT IF IT WERE POSSIBLE THAT RODDY WAS ON THE TRAIL OF THAT TREMENDOUS BUCK IF SO IT WOULD BE A CHASE WORTH FOLLOWING A DIVERSION RENDERED THE MORE EXQUISITE TO LANYARD BY THE SPICE OF NOVELTY SINCE FOR ONCE HE WOULD FIGURE AS A DISPASSIONATE BYSTANDER
THE LORD OF ARKELL SPRANG TO HIS COMRADE'S SIDE WITH A HURRIED WORD OF PRAISE HE FLUNG THE GABARDINE ABOUT HER GRASPED HER ARM AND BADE HER KEEP HER EYES FIRMLY FIXED UPON THE LIONS THEN STEP BY STEP THOSE TWO FOOLHARDY YOUNG PERSONS BACKED SLOWLY OUT OF THE DANGER
HE IMITATED THEIR SCREAMS AS A JOKE AND DESCRIBED THE PARTS OF THEIR BODIES WHICH ARE CONSIDERED BEST TO EAT HORRID AS SUCH A DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES MUST BE THE FEARS OF THE OLD WOMEN WHEN HUNGER BEGINS TO PRESS ARE MORE PAINFUL TO THINK OF
SO THAT THERE WAS ALMOST AS GREAT A STORM OF WIND IN HER LITTLE ROOM AS THERE WAS OUTSIDE OF IT IF THERE WAS ANY TRUTH IN THE STORY IT IS EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE FACT THAT THE POOR OLD WOMAN HAD BEEN A LITTLE OUT OF HER MIND FOR MANY YEARS
AND HIS NAME AND EXPLOITS HAD OFTEN APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND WHEN IT WAS LEARNED THAT THIS CRITTER WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE IDENTICAL BUFFALO HUNTING BRIGHAM NEARLY THE WHOLE CROWD ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD HEARD OF HIM BEFORE AND HAD THEY KNOWN HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE RULED HIM OUT
WAS BORNE TO THE GRAVE IN THIS STYLE A GUARD MARCHED IN FRONT OF THE CORPSE THE CAP TAIN OF IT IN THE REAR EACH MAN HELD HIS GUN UP SIDE DOWN AS A SIGN THAT THE DEAD WOULD WAR NO MORE AND THE DRUMS BEAT THE DEAD MARCH WHEN NEAR THE GRAVE
FOR HE TOO HAD TALKED HIMSELF INTO A FUME BIG WORDS NE'ER KILLED SO MUCH AS A MOUSE WHO ART THOU THAT TALKEST SO FREELY OF CRACKING THE HEAD OF ARTHUR A BLAND IF I DO NOT TAN THY HIDE THIS DAY AS NE'ER I TANNED A CALF'S HIDE IN ALL MY LIFE BEFORE
HER EYES WERE UNIFORMLY FASTENED ON THE POINT WHERE THE ROAD WAS SUDDENLY LOST BY THE INTERVENTION OF A HILL AND AT EACH TURN AS SHE LOST SIGHT OF THE SPOT SHE LINGERED UNTIL AN IMPATIENT MOVEMENT OF HER SISTER QUICKENED HER PACE TO AN EVEN MOTION WITH THAT OF HER OWN
I JUDGE THAT YOU RENT IT YES WE RENT IT AND WE HAVE BEEN HERE TWO MONTHS IT WAS THE ONLY HOUSE I COULD GET IN A LOCALITY CONVENIENT FOR ME BESIDES THE OLD PLACE SUITS ME IT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN AN OBSOLETE GHOST OR SO TO SCARE ME AWAY FROM WHAT I LIKE
UNDER HIS ARM HE HELD AN OLD UMBRELLA THAT WAS AS TALL AS HE WAS ITS COVERING HAD ONCE BEEN OF THICK BROWN CLOTH BUT THE COLOR HAD FADED TO A DULL DRAB EXCEPT IN THE CREASES AND TROT THOUGHT IT LOOKED VERY OLD FASHIONED AND COMMON
THEN HE WENT OFF TO THE TOP OF A HILL NEAR BY AND SAT DOWN AND DREW HIS ROBE OVER HIS HEAD AND BEGAN TO MOURN FOR HIS HORSE AS HE SAT THERE HE HEARD A GREAT WIND STORM COMING UP AND IT PASSED OVER HIM WITH A LOUD RUSHING SOUND AND AFTER THE WIND CAME A RAIN
CONSISTS JUST IN FINDING THE INDISPENSABLE CONNECTION WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL INTERESTS BUT THAT'S NOT TO THE POINT WHAT IS TO THE POINT IS A CORRECTION I MUST MAKE IN YOUR COMPARISON THE BIRCHES ARE NOT SIMPLY STUCK IN BUT SOME ARE SOWN AND SOME ARE PLANTED
WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY AWARE THAT I WAS NOT THE ONLY WITNESS OF THEIR INTERVIEW A WISP OF GREEN FLOATING IN THE AIR CAUGHT MY EYE AND ANOTHER GLANCE SHOWED ME THAT IT WAS CARRIED ON A STICK BY A MAN WHO WAS MOVING AMONG THE BROKEN GROUND
AS THE HOUSE WAS QUITE STILL LILITH GLIDED NOISELESSLY DOWN THE STAIRS WENT INTO THE STUDIO WHERE AS YET THERE ASSUREDLY WAS NO VAMPIRE AND CONCEALED HERSELF IN A CORNER AS IT WOULD NOT DO FOR AN EARNEST STUDENT LIKE HEINRICH TO BE AWAY FROM HIS WORK VERY OFTEN
SO THAT I NEVER LAY DOWN AT NIGHT WITHOUT A HOPE OF THE VISION COMING BACK HERS WAS THE CHARACTER HE DREW IN LITTLE NELL IN THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP WHEN HE CAME TO THE PART OF THE STORY WHICH TELLS OF LITTLE NELL'S DEATH
HE WASN'T AFRAID AND HE INTENDED THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW IT ESPECIALLY REDTAIL IT IS BECAUSE OF HIS FEARLESSNESS THAT HE IS CALLED KINGBIRD ALL THE TIME HE WAS SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS CALLING REDTAIL A ROBBER AND EVERY OTHER BAD NAME HE COULD THINK OF
ON THE CONTRARY REPLIED THE PRINCESS IT IS I WHO HAVE FOUND ONE AND OPENING THE BOX SHE SHOWED HER ASTONISHED BROTHERS THE PEARLS INSIDE THEN ON THE WAY BACK TO THE PALACE SHE TOLD THEM OF HER CONSULTATION WITH THE BIRD AND THE ADVICE IT HAD GIVEN HER
YOUR GENTLE WORDS FOR PITY'S SAKE TELL ME THAT IT IS SO AND I WILL FORGIVE YOU FOR HAVING INVOLUNTARILY DECEIVED ME AND WILL TRY TO CURE MYSELF OF MY FOLLY BUT I WILL NOT LEAVE THIS ROOM I WILL NOT ABANDON THE DEAR HOPE THAT HAS BROUGHT ME HERE TO NIGHT
IT WAS YOUR MOTHER'S WHEN SHE WAS A LITTLE GIRL NOW THIS APRON WAS ALL FADED AND IT HAD PATCHES ON IT OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF CLOTH KAT LOOKED AT HER BEST DRESS THEN SHE LOOKED AT THE APRON THEN SHE THOUGHT ABOUT THE MILK CART
IF YOU HAVE NO UMBRELLA AND FIND YOURSELF OVERTAKEN BY A SUDDEN SHOWER AND ANY PERSON PROVIDED WITH ONE IS GOING IN THE SAME DIRECTION YOU MAY REQUEST THEM TO SHELTER YOU THEY SHOULD RECEIVE YOUR REQUEST WITH MUCH POLITENESS INFORM THEMSELVES OF THE PLACE WHERE YOU WISH TO STOP
WE ARRIVED EARLY BECAUSE LENA LIKED TO WATCH THE PEOPLE COME IN THERE WAS A NOTE ON THE PROGRAMME SAYING THAT THE INCIDENTAL MUSIC WOULD BE FROM THE OPERA TRAVIATA WHICH WAS MADE FROM THE SAME STORY AS THE PLAY WE HAD NEITHER OF US READ THE PLAY AND WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT
AND THE BUYER WOULD GET WHAT HE WAS NEVER MEANT TO HAVE AND NEVER BOUGHT AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE MISTER VENUS BUT THE CAUSE OF THE WRONG SAY IT WAS PAPERS MISTER VENUS PROPOUNDS ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY CONTAINED WE SHOULD OFFER TO DISPOSE OF EM TO THE PARTIES MOST INTERESTED
HIS AGE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANYTHING FROM TWENTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE BUT HIS HAIR AND BROWS WERE JET BLACK HIS EYES TOO WERE NEARER TO REAL BLACK THAN ANY HUMAN EYES I HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE EXCEPTING THE AWFUL EYES OF HASSAN OF ALEPPO HASSAN OF ALEPPO
THERE WAS A SOLEMN THOUGH MOMENTARY SILENCE WHICH WAS BROKEN BY ARAMIS I SWEAR HE SAID WITH A CALM BROW AND KINDLY GLANCE BUT IN A VOICE STILL TREMBLING WITH RECENT EMOTION I SWEAR THAT I NO LONGER BEAR ANIMOSITY TO THOSE WHO WERE ONCE MY FRIENDS
IT WASN'T FEAR OF REDDY FOX OR REDTAIL THE HAWK OR HOOTY THE OWL OR OLD MAN COYOTE THEY WERE FOREVER TRYING TO CATCH HIM BUT THEY DID NOT STRIKE TERROR TO HIS HEART BECAUSE HE FELT QUITE SMART ENOUGH TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR CLUTCHES
I WAS GLAD SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW GOOD THAT HEART DID FEEL UNDER MY BLOUSE WHEN THE BOY BROUGHT THAT BASKET OF FISH FROM JUDGE WADE'S FISHING EXPEDITION SATURDAY I HAVE FIRMLY DETERMINED NOT TO BLUSH ANY MORE AT THE THOUGHT OF THAT GORGEOUS MAN
AT THE FARTHER END OF THE COURT THERE WAS A PLATFORM RICHLY FURNISHED WITH A THRONE OF AMBER IN THE MIDDLE SUPPORTED BY FOUR COLUMNS OF EBONY ENRICHED WITH DIAMONDS AND PEARLS OF AN EXTRAORDINARY SIZE AND COVERED WITH RED SATIN EMBROIDERED WITH INDIAN GOLD OF ADMIRABLE WORKMANSHIP
LOUIS KEPT IT WITH HIS ACCUSTOMED GOOD FAITH AND WHEN CAESAR ARRIVED BEFORE BOLOGNA HE RECEIVED AN INTIMATION FROM THE KING OF FRANCE THAT HE WAS NOT TO ENTER ON ANY UNDERTAKING AGAINST HIS ALLY BENTIVOGLIO CAESAR NOT BEING THE MAN TO HAVE HIS PLANS UPSET FOR NOTHING
AND HE HAD BEEN FORESTALLED HIMSELF THIS COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN DONE THEY HAD HAD NO INTEREST IN HIM BEFORE THEN WHILE THEY HELD HIM AT THE CRIME CLUB WHILE HE WAS SPENDING THAT TWO HOURS IN THE CAR WAS THAT WHY THEY HAD TAKEN SO LONG IN COMING
WHEN SPRINGTIME CAME AND ALL AROUND BEGAN TO LOOK GREEN AND BRIGHT ONE MORNING THE BEAR SAID TO SNOW WHITE NOW I MUST LEAVE YOU AND ALL THE SUMMER LONG I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO COME BACK WHERE THEN ARE YOU GOING DEAR BEAR ASKED SNOW WHITE

AND REACHING ROUND TO HIS HIP POCKET BRETON DREW OUT A BROWNING REVOLVER AND WAGGED IT IN HIS HAND WITH A SMILE THAT'S A USEFUL THING TO HAVE SPARGO HE REMARKED I SLIPPED IT INTO MY POCKET THE OTHER DAY WONDERING WHY ON EARTH I DID IT
AND I MAY LIKEN THE GOOD GALAHAD UNTO THE SON OF THE HIGH FATHER THAT LIGHTED WITHIN A MAID AND BOUGHT ALL THE SOULS OUT OF THRALL SO DID SIR GALAHAD DELIVER ALL THE MAIDENS OUT OF THE WOFUL CASTLE NOW SIR GAWAINE SAID THE GOOD MAN THOU MUST DO PENANCE FOR THY SIN
BUT BIDDING ME BE OF GOOD CHEER AND HAVE NO FEAR OF THE LAW FOR THAT THE BAN AGAINST ME AND THE HEAD PRICE HAD BEEN DEAD FOR MANY A YEAR TWAS GRACE HAD MADE HER LAWYERS MOVE FOR THIS REFUSING HERSELF TO SIGN THE HUE AND CRY
HE KNEW JUST WHAT TO EXPECT SO WHEN THE NUTHATCH SET HIM DOWN ON THE BARK TO LOOK AT HIM HE UNHOOKED HIS FEET FROM THE BARK AND TUMBLED TO THE GROUND THE NUTHATCH TRIED TO CATCH HIM AND BROKE OFF ONE OF HIS LEGS BUT SHE NEVER FOUND HIM AGAIN ALTHOUGH SHE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED
MARGERY LOOKED AT ME I THINK SHE WAS FAIRLY STUNNED TO LEARN THAT HER FATHER HAD MARRIED AGAIN THAT HE HAD BEEN THE KEYSTONE IN AN ARCH OF VILLAINY THAT WITH HIM GONE WAS NOW ABOUT TO FALL AND TO ASSOCIATE HIM WITH SO SMALL AND MEAN A THING
BUT YOU'RE ALWAYS BRAGGING ABOUT SOMETHING GOT THE BOOKS THERE THEY ARE HERE SIR ALL RIGHT I'LL TURN THE GENERAL SUBJECT OVER IN MY MIND FOR A MINUTE OR TWO AND WHILE I'M ABOUT IT YOU CAN EMPTY YOUR BAG AND GET READY FOR ME
EVENTUALLY AMID THE WILD REJOICINGS OF THE NATIVES AND COOLIES I HAD THE LION CARRIED TO MY BOMA WHICH WAS CLOSE AT HAND ON EXAMINATION WE FOUND NO LESS THAN SIX BULLET HOLES IN THE BODY AND EMBEDDED ONLY A LITTLE WAY IN THE FLESH OF THE BACK
HE WILL KEEP THE COLD OUT AND I'VE FOUND THAT IF A FELLOW USES HIS EYES AND ISN'T AFRAID OF A LITTLE WORK HE CAN FIND PLENTY TO EAT AT LEAST I CAN THE ONLY TIME I EVER GET REALLY WORRIED IS WHEN THE TREES ARE COVERED WITH ICE
THIS BELIEF IS AS MUCH A PART OF ANY MAN EVER BORN IN ANY LOCATION AS HIS HANDS AND HIS FEET WHETHER HE BELIEVES HIS SOUL ENTERS A CAT AND WORKS BACK TO MAN AGAIN AFTER LONG TRANSMIGRATION OR GOES TO A HAPPY HUNTING GROUND AS OUR INDIANS
IS IT LIKELY THAT I WOULD HAVE DWELLED SO LONG UPON MY COAT OF ARMS BUT FOR SOME GOOD REASON AND THIS GOOD REASON IS THAT LORNA TOOK THE GREATEST PRIDE IN IT AND THOUGHT OR AT ANY RATE SAID THAT IT QUITE THREW INTO THE SHADE AND ECLIPSED ALL HER OWN ANCIENT GLORIES
THAT TWO VALUABLE JERSEY CALVES TIED TO STAKES ON THE HILLSIDE HAD FLUNG THEMSELVES VIOLENTLY DOWN THE BANK AND STRANGLED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR OWN ROPES IN A MANNER WHICH SEEMED TO SHOW THAT THEY FOUND NO PLEASURE IN EXISTENCE AT ALL EVENTS ON THE PEABODY FARM
BY WHICH IT IS SUPPRESSED AND MUST WAIT UNTIL A DREAM ISOLATES IT THAT WHICH THE DREAM SHOWS US IN ENLARGED FORM AS A RESULT OF SUCH ISOLATION SHRINKS TOGETHER AGAIN AFTER IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY DOCKETED IN ITS RELATION TO LIFE AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERPRETATION
WHICH WERE SORE BESTEAD WITH THEIR ENEMIES SIR GRIEVE YOU NOT SAID SIR GAWAINE FOR THEIR GREE SHALL BE THEIRS I SHALL NOT ONCE MOVE MY HORSE TO THEM WARD BUT IF I SEE MORE THAN THERE BE FOR THEY BE STRONG ENOUGH TO MATCH THEM
AND WAS PREPARING TO GO INTO SOCIETY A PRIVATE SECRETARY WILL NEVER RISE IN THE WORLD IF HE COUPLES GREAT AND SMALL IN THAT WAY CONTINUED NELLO WHEN GREAT MEN ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MARRY THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS AS THEY LIKE SMALL MEN MUST NOT EXPECT TO MARRY THEIR WORDS AS THEY LIKE
IN THIS MISERABLE STATE THEY CAME TO THE FIRST VILLAGE THE PEASANTS WIVES FLOCKED ABOUT THEM AND AS IT APPEARED THROUGH THEIR DISGUISE THAT THEY WERE PEOPLE OF SOME CONDITION ASKED THEM WHAT WAS THE OCCASION OF THEIR TRAVELLING IN A HABIT THAT DID NOT SEEM TO BELONG TO THEM
ALL TROPICAL CLIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO EPIDEMICS OF A MOST DESTRUCTIVE NATURE THE INHABITANTS OF NEW ORLEANS LOOK WITH AS MUCH CERTAINTY FOR THE APPEARANCE OF THE YELLOW FEVER SMALL POX OR CHOLERA IN THE HOT SEASON AS THE LONDONER DOES FOR FOG IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER
AND ASK'D EVERY ONE HE SAW IF THEY KNEW ANY THING OF HER BUT THE WHOLE GANG WERE TOO INTENT UPON OTHER MATTERS TO RETURN HIM ANY ANSWER BY VIRTUE OF THEIR NIGHT'S EXCURSIONS THEY HAD BROUGHT IN SOME FRESH BOOTY AND WERE BUSY IN DIVIDING THE SPOIL
THE GOVERNOR'S CIRC'LAR STEPS BROUGHT MANY PILGRIMS DOWN THE MAIN STREET OF BEULAH FIRST AND LAST AND THE ORIGINAL HAMILTONS HAD BEEN VERY PROUD OF THEM PRIDE OF SUCH SIMPLE THINGS AS STONE STEPS HAD DIED OUT OF THE HAMILTON STOCK IN THE COURSE OF YEARS
FELT HERSELF A PRINCESS AND CARRIED HER AUTHORITY OVER HIM WITH A HIGH TONE IN ALL THEIR ARRANGEMENTS SHE HAD A FANCY FOR LORD DAVID LORD DAVID WAS HANDSOME BUT THAT WAS OVER AND ABOVE THE BARGAIN SHE CONSIDERED HIM TO BE FASHIONABLE TO BE FASHIONABLE IS EVERYTHING

WHERE WILL IT END WHERE IS THE VALUE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY WHAT STRENGTH IS THERE IN BILLS OF RIGHTS IN LIMITATIONS OF POWER WHAT NEW HOPE FOR MANKIND IS TO BE FOUND IN WRITTEN CONSTITUTIONS WHAT REMEDY WHICH DID NOT EXIST UNDER KINGS OR EMPERORS
BUT HE NEVER HAS ANY REGARD FOR HIS POOR SISTER PENELON PENELON AN OLD MAN WHO WAS DIGGING BUSILY AT ONE OF THE BEDS STUCK HIS SPADE IN THE EARTH AND APPROACHED CAP IN HAND STRIVING TO CONCEAL A QUID OF TOBACCO HE HAD JUST THRUST INTO HIS CHEEK
YET I HAVE NOT PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE ENOUGH TO DO IT SO CONSTANTLY AS I OUGHT MY PAPPA WHO TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF PAINS TO PUT ME IN THE RIGHT WAY HAS ALSO ADVISED ME TO PRESERVE COPIES OF ALL MY LETTERS AND HAS GIVEN ME A CONVENIENT BLANK BOOK FOR THIS END
I THINK SHE'D PITCH INTO HIM AS YOU CALL IT HERSELF IF SHE KNEW HOW YOU COME DOWN TO GUESTWICK FOR THE CHRISTMAS AND THEN GO OVER TO ALLINGTON AND TELL THEM ALL PLAINLY WHAT YOU MEAN I COULDN'T SAY A WORD TO HER NOW SAY IT TO THE SQUIRE THEN

FOR IM TO LOOK SO LIKE BEING AS E BELONGED TO THE YOUNGER BRANCH WHO AVEN'T ELD THE TITLE FOR FOUR GENERATIONS BUT COME TO DRESS IM IN VELVET AND GOLD LACE AND THE LIKENESS WOULD BE NIGH AS PERFECT AS IF E AD STOOD FOR IT
SO HE PURCHASED A BUN AND A BOTTLE OF LEMONADE AT A NEIGHBOURING SHOP AND SAT BY THE ROADSIDE TO RECOVER THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF HIS PURSUERS HE FELT RELUCTANT TO RETURN HOME IT IS ALWAYS WELL TO FOLLOW A MORNING'S ABSENCE FROM SCHOOL BY AN AFTERNOON'S ABSENCE FROM SCHOOL
THERE WAS STILL A BASKET OF CHAMPAGNE LEFT HE DANCED THE HURDY GURDY ON THAT BASKET TILL HE CUT HIS FEET THE CHAMPAGNE WAS ALL GONE BUT HE STILL HAD SOME GOLD NUGGETS THERE WAS A MIRROR IN THE BAR ROOM VALUED AT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS
ALL SUCH DIFFICULTIES SHOULD BE MUST BE AVOIDED FOR MISTER SALTON'S SAKE FOR ADAM'S OWN SAKE AND MOST OF ALL FOR MIMI WATFORD'S SAKE BEFORE HE SPOKE AGAIN SIR NATHANIEL HAD MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE MUST TRY TO POSTPONE DECISIVE ACTION UNTIL THE CIRCUMSTANCES ON WHICH THEY DEPENDED
HE LAUGHED SO THE WHILE LIKE A GREAT CROAKING FROG THAT I MIGHT HAVE CAUGHT HIM HAD MY BREATH NOT BEEN AS SHORT AS HIS LEGS WERE LONG THE YOUNG MAN LISTENED TO THIS TALE OF WRONG WITH ALL THE SERIOUSNESS THAT HE COULD MAINTAIN BUT
THAT IS THE LAW WHICH PROVIDES FOR IT MUST DECREE ALSO THAT INTEREST ON SUMS LENT ON DEPOSIT OR ON MORTGAGE THROUGHOUT THE REALM AS WELL AS HOUSE AND FARM RENTS SHALL BE REDUCED TO THREE PER CENT THIS SIMULTANEOUS REDUCTION OF ALL KINDS OF INCOME
AND AS HE LEANED BACK IN HIS SEAT HE STILL LOOKED AT THE PICTURESQUE FIGURE WHICH THEY HAD PASSED AS IF HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SORRY TO SEE IT TURN ITS HEAD TOWARD HIM IN FACT IT SEEMED THAT NOTWITHSTANDING HIS USUAL GOOD FORTUNE
AS LONG AS ANYONE COULD REMEMBER EVER SINCE KATE AND JULIA AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR BROTHER PAT HAD LEFT THE HOUSE IN STONEY BATTER AND TAKEN MARY JANE THEIR ONLY NIECE TO LIVE WITH THEM IN THE DARK GAUNT HOUSE ON USHER'S ISLAND THE UPPER PART OF WHICH THEY HAD RENTED FROM MISTER FULHAM THE CORN FACTOR ON THE GROUND FLOOR

THE ACTION OF THE NERVES HE BEGAN EAGERLY IS CURIOUSLY SLOW IN SOME PEOPLE I HAD A FRIEND ONCE THAT IF YOU BURNT HIM WITH A RED HOT POKER IT WOULD TAKE YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE HE FELT IT AND IF YOU ONLY PINCHED HIM QUERIED SYLVIE
FELLOW SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF MISTER FRERE I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ME DID I IF YOU DON'T PLEASE ME IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT PERHAPS WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU SOLDIERS HAVE SO MANY THINGS TO THINK OF YOUR GUARDS AND SENTRIES AND VISITS AND THINGS

THOUGH SHE FELT REALLY INTERESTED IN THE WELFARE OF COLONEL BRANDON COULD NOT BESTOW ALL THE WONDER ON HIS GOING SO SUDDENLY AWAY WHICH MISSUS JENNINGS WAS DESIROUS OF HER FEELING FOR BESIDES THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID NOT IN HER OPINION JUSTIFY SUCH LASTING AMAZEMENT
VIRGINIA WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE STARE THAT GREETED HER AND HER COMPANION AS THEY ENTERED BUT HER THOUGHT WAS DIRECTED MORE AND MORE TO THE APPROACHING SCENE WITH HER GRANDMOTHER WHAT WOULD MADAM PAGE SAY LOREEN WAS NEARLY SOBER NOW BUT SHE WAS LAPSING INTO A STATE OF STUPOR
HIS MOTTO WAS IT WILL ALL COME RIGHT IN THE END BUT WHAT IT DID COME TO WAS RUIN FOR MASTER PETER HE WAS AT HIS WITS END TO KNOW HOW TO EARN AN HONEST LIVING FOR TRY AS HE MIGHT ILL LUCK SEEMED TO PURSUE HIM
SHE WAS VERY YOUNG THE SCENES SHE HAD WITNESSED IN THE PAST TWO YEARS COULD NOT HELP BUT EXCITE THE IMAGINATION OF A YOUNG GIRL LEFT ENTIRELY TO HER OWN INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL RESOURCES WHAT SCENES GREAT GOD AND NOW TO WAIT FOR AN OPPORTUNITY
PROMPT AND PERFECT WAS HER MOTTO THE LONG HOT SUMMER DAYS WERE VERY TRYING AND SOMETIMES SHE GOT VERY TIRED OF IT ALL BUT WHEN ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF HER FIRST VENTURE SHE MADE UP HER ACCOUNTS SHE WAS WELL PLEASED TO BE SURE SHE HAD NOT MADE A FORTUNE BUT SHE HAD PAID ALL THEIR EXPENSES

TILL ITS FELLOW WAS BROUGHT BEFORE HIM WHEN THEY HEARD THIS THE JEW AND THE BOY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THEIR EYES SAID WHERE ARE WE TO GO TO FIND THE OTHER ONE BUT AS THEY KNEW THERE WAS NO USE IN DISPUTING THE DECISION
WILL YOU GIVE ME YOUR CHARCOAL THE FIRST THING IS TO GET THE HEADS INTO THEIR PLACES ON THE CANVAS DON'T THINK OF DETAIL BUT OF TWO OR THREE POINTS THE CROWN OF THE HEAD THE POINT OF THE CHIN THE PLACING OF THE EAR
SOMETIMES IT LAY IN THE BOTTOM OF HIS BOAT SOMETIMES HE HUNG IT LOOSE ROUND HIS NECK HE WAS A LIGHT DRESSER WAS THIS MAN YOU SEE LIFTING THE LOOSE NECKERCHIEF OVER HIS BREAST AND TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY OF WIPING THE DEAD LIPS WITH IT
HE MIGHT FIND SOME BETTER WAY TO DO SO THAN BY ADVANCING SUCH CRAZY IDEAS BUT THIS CONTINUED THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS A SUBJECT OF SMALL IMPORTANCE WHAT HE WISHED ESPECIALLY TO CALL THEIR ATTENTION TO WAS THE FACT THAT HE HAD SERVED THE DISTRICT FAITHFULLY AS REPRESENTATIVE
AND THE REAL COOK WHO HAD COME BACK FROM THE RACE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE HIM HE MAY BE THE COOK BUT HE DID NOT COOK THIS FEAST SAID THE BRIDEGROOM AND THEN INQUIRY WAS MADE AND THE GIRL WAS SUMMONED TO THE GREAT HALL THAT IS MY MARRIED WIFE HE DECLARED

UNTIL HE COULD SET UP HIS OWN PLANT HE WOULD HAVE TWO OUTFITS ONE IN THE BIG TENT WHERE THE HUMMING BIRD WAS TO BE PUT TOGETHER AND ANOTHER ON THE MACHINE ITSELF SO THAT WHEN IN THE AIR PRACTICING OR EVEN IN THE GREAT RACE ITSELF THERE WOULD BE NO BREAK IN THE NEWS THAT WAS TO BE FLASHED THROUGH SPACE

PREPARATION MAY BE EITHER GENERAL OR SPECIFIC USUALLY IT SHOULD BE BOTH A LIFE TIME OF READING OF COMPANIONSHIP WITH STIRRING THOUGHTS OF WRESTLING WITH THE PROBLEMS OF LIFE THIS CONSTITUTES A GENERAL PREPARATION OF INESTIMABLE WORTH OUT OF A WELL STORED MIND AND RICHER STILL A BROAD EXPERIENCE AND BEST OF ALL A WARMLY SYMPATHETIC HEART THE SPEAKER WILL HAVE TO DRAW MUCH MATERIAL THAT NO IMMEDIATE STUDY COULD PROVIDE
TOM COULD THINK OF NOTHING MORE STRIKING TO SAY OF HIM THAN THAT WHEN HE WAS A BOY THERE WASN'T NOTHING HIGHER THAN YOUR CHIMBLEYS THERE WASN'T A WIRE NOR A CABLE IN THE SKY OLD SMALLWAYS WENT TO HIS GRAVE UNDER AN INTRICATE NETWORK OF WIRES AND CABLES

TO GET TO THE TOP OF IT HOWEVER HE THOUGHT THERE MUST BE SOME WAY UP AFTER ALL SO TAKING OFF HIS BOOTS AND CAP HE SET OFF TO WALK ROUND THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN IN HALF AN HOUR HE CAME TO A MILL WITH TWELVE MILLSTONES
