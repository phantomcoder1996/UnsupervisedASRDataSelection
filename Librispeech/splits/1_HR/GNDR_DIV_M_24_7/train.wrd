ALTHOUGH PERHAPS I COULD NAME A COUNTRY WHICH WOULD BE GLAD TO EAT UP OUR WHOLE NATION WITHOUT IT AFTER ALL I AM NOT SO VIOLENTLY BENT UPON MY OWN OPINION AS TO REJECT ANY OFFER PROPOSED BY WISE MEN
AN OLD GRIFFITH BIOGRAPH FIRST ISSUED IN NINETEEN ELEVEN BEFORE GRIFFITH'S NAME OR THAT OF ANY ACTOR IN FILMS WAS ADVERTISED BLANCHE SWEET IS THE LEADING LADY AND CHARLES H WEST THE LEADING MAN
FULL IN OUR OWN POWER AND WHEREBY WE CAN INCUR NO DANGER
A VERY GREAT ADDITIONAL GRIEVANCE AND THEREFORE WHOEVER COULD FIND OUT A FAIR CHEAP AND EASY METHOD OF MAKING THESE CHILDREN
RAGGED GLOWERING STRIKERS AND GOSSIPING DICKERING PEOPLE IN THE MARKETPLACE ONLY GRIFFITH AND HIS CLOSE DISCIPLES CAN DO THESE AS WELL AS ALMOST ANY MANAGER CAN REPRODUCE THE OCEAN
THIS WOULD BE A GREAT INDUCEMENT TO MARRIAGE WHICH ALL WISE NATIONS HAVE EITHER ENCOURAGED BY REWARDS OR ENFORCED BY LAWS AND PENALTIES IT WOULD ENCREASE THE CARE AND TENDERNESS OF MOTHERS TOWARDS THEIR CHILDREN
AS TO OUR CITY OF DUBLIN SHAMBLES MAY BE APPOINTED FOR THIS PURPOSE IN THE MOST CONVENIENT PARTS OF IT AND BUTCHERS WE MAY BE ASSURED WILL NOT BE WANTING ALTHOUGH I RATHER RECOMMEND
THERE IS NOT A GOOD FILM IN THE WORLD BUT IS THE BETTER FOR BEING SEEN IN IMMEDIATE SUCCESSION TO ITSELF SIX REEL PROGRAMMES ARE A WEARINESS TO THE FLESH THE BEST OF THE OLD ONE REEL BIOGRAPHS OF GRIFFITH
ADDING THOSE WHO ARE BEGGARS BY PROFESSION TO THE BULK OF FARMERS COTTAGERS AND LABOURERS WITH THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN WHO ARE BEGGARS IN EFFECT I DESIRE THOSE POLITICIANS WHO DISLIKE MY OVERTURE
BUT THIS AND MANY OTHERS I OMIT BEING STUDIOUS OF BREVITY SUPPOSING THAT ONE THOUSAND FAMILIES IN THIS CITY WOULD BE CONSTANT CUSTOMERS FOR INFANTS FLESH BESIDES
AS TO MY SELF HAVING BEEN WEARIED OUT FOR MANY YEARS WITH OFFERING VAIN IDLE VISIONARY THOUGHTS AND AT LENGTH UTTERLY DESPAIRING OF SUCCESS I FORTUNATELY FELL UPON THIS PROPOSAL WHICH AS IT IS WHOLLY NEW
THAT I HAVE NOT THE LEAST PERSONAL INTEREST IN ENDEAVOURING TO PROMOTE THIS NECESSARY WORK HAVING NO OTHER MOTIVE THAN THE PUBLICK GOOD OF MY COUNTRY BY ADVANCING OUR TRADE PROVIDING FOR INFANTS RELIEVING THE POOR
AND THE MOST INEVITABLE PROSPECT OF INTAILING THE LIKE OR GREATER MISERIES UPON THEIR BREED FOR EVER I PROFESS IN THE SINCERITY OF MY HEART
AND TO FATTEN THEM WOULD NOT ANSWER THE CHARGE
OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTINUED VERY EASY BUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN THEIR CONSTERNATION WAS VERY GREAT AND THE RICHER SORT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY FROM THE WEST PART OF THE CITY
AS THIS CONFLUX OF THE PEOPLE TO A YOUTHFUL AND GAY COURT MADE A GREAT TRADE IN THE CITY ESPECIALLY IN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO FASHION AND FINERY
THAT ANY SHOULD HAVE HEARTS SO HARDENED IN THE MIDST OF SUCH A CALAMITY AS TO ROB AND STEAL YET CERTAIN IT IS THAT ALL SORTS OF VILLAINIES AND EVEN LEVITIES AND DEBAUCHERIES
IN ONE WEEK SINCE THE PRECEDING VISITATION OF SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX HOWEVER ALL THIS WENT OFF AGAIN AND THE WEATHER PROVING COLD AND THE FROST WHICH BEGAN IN DECEMBER
TWENTY MORE WHO WERE REALLY DEAD OF THE PLAGUE IN THAT PARISH BUT HAD BEEN SET DOWN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER OR OTHER DISTEMPERS BESIDES OTHERS CONCEALED
IT BEGAN TO BE SUSPECTED THAT THE PLAGUE WAS AMONG THE PEOPLE AT THAT END OF THE TOWN AND THAT MANY HAD DIED OF IT THOUGH THEY HAD TAKEN CARE TO KEEP IT AS MUCH FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE
MANUFACTURERS AND THE LIKE
THIS POSSESSED THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE VERY MUCH AND FEW CARED TO GO THROUGH DRURY LANE OR THE OTHER STREETS SUSPECTED UNLESS THEY HAD EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS THAT OBLIGED THEM TO IT
BUT AFTER THAT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY ANOTHER DIED IN ANOTHER HOUSE BUT IN THE SAME PARISH AND IN THE SAME MANNER THIS TURNED THE PEOPLE'S EYES PRETTY MUCH TOWARDS THAT END OF THE TOWN
BUT THEN MY SERVANT WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO TAKE DOWN WITH ME DECEIVED ME AND BEING FRIGHTED AT THE INCREASE OF THE DISTEMPER AND NOT KNOWING WHEN I SHOULD GO HE TOOK OTHER MEASURES AND LEFT ME
MY BROTHER THOUGH A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN HIMSELF LAUGHED AT ALL I HAD SUGGESTED ABOUT ITS BEING AN INTIMATION FROM HEAVEN AND TOLD ME SEVERAL STORIES OF SUCH FOOLHARDY PEOPLE AS HE CALLED THEM
AND THAT WE HOPED WAS NOT TRUE TILL THE LATTER END OF NOVEMBER OR THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN TWO MEN SAID TO BE FRENCHMEN DIED OF THE PLAGUE IN LONG ACRE
AND IT WAS MEET HE SHOULD DO WITH ME AS SHOULD SEEM GOOD TO HIM WITH THIS RESOLUTION I WENT TO BED
AND TO CLAMOUR FOR PROTECTING LAWS FROM IRELAND THE VICTORIOUS CHIEF
IN HIS PROSPERITY HAD CLAIMED BROTHERHOOD WITH HIM HUNTED FROM HIS HOME FORBIDDEN UNDER SEVERE PENALTIES TO PRAY OR RECEIVE THE SACRAMENT ACCORDING TO HIS CONSCIENCE YET STILL FIRM IN HIS RESOLUTION
BUT BOTH IN PUBLIC AND IN THE CLOSET HE ON EVERY OCCASION EXPRESSED HIS CONCERN THAT GENTLEMEN SO SINCERELY ATTACHED TO MONARCHY SHOULD UNADVISEDLY ENCROACH ON THE PREROGATIVE OF THE MONARCH
OR THAT THE DIGNITY WHICH WAS THE JUST REWARD OF HIS PERSONAL MERIT SHOULD BE DECLARED HEREDITARY IN HIS FAMILY
AND DREAD TO HIS SUBJECTS FEW INDEED LOVED HIS GOVERNMENT BUT THOSE WHO HATED IT MOST HATED IT LESS THAN THEY FEARED IT HAD IT BEEN A WORSE GOVERNMENT IT MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN OVERTHROWN IN SPITE OF ALL ITS STRENGTH HAD IT BEEN A WEAKER GOVERNMENT
DREW ON HIM MUCH DESERVED AND SOME UNDESERVED CENSURE
THE FEW MEMBERS WHO MADE UP WHAT WAS CONTEMPTUOUSLY CALLED THE RUMP OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS HAD NO MORE CLAIM THAN THE MILITARY CHIEFS TO BE ESTEEMED THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION THE DISPUTE WAS SOON BROUGHT TO A DECISIVE ISSUE CROMWELL FILLED THE HOUSE WITH ARMED MEN
THE PARLIAMENT FORGOT THAT IT WAS BUT THE CREATURE OF THE ARMY THE ARMY WAS LESS DISPOSED THAN EVER TO SUBMIT TO THE DICTATION OF THE PARLIAMENT INDEED
THE GREAT MAJORITY HOWEVER WERE DISPOSED TO SUPPORT THEIR GENERAL AS ELECTIVE FIRST MAGISTRATE OF A COMMONWEALTH AGAINST ALL FACTIONS WHICH MIGHT RESIST HIS AUTHORITY
AND IT SEEMED LIKELY THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO DEAL AT ONCE
THE COMMONS ALONE COULD LEGALLY GRANT HIM MONEY THEY COULD NOT BE PREVENTED FROM PUTTING THEIR OWN PRICE ON THEIR GRANTS THE PRICE WHICH THEY PUT ON THEIR GRANTS WAS THIS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO INTERFERE WITH EVERY ONE OF THE KING'S PREROGATIVES
THAT HE SHOULD SINK INTO A MERE LOUNGER AND VOLUPTUARY THAT THE GRAVEST AFFAIRS OF STATE SHOULD BE NEGLECTED AND THAT THE PUBLIC SERVICE SHOULD BE STARVED AND THE FINANCES DERANGED IN ORDER THAT HARLOTS AND PARASITES MIGHT GROW RICH
AND HOW WHEN IT WAS KNOWN THAT HE WAS NO MORE AMSTERDAM WAS LIGHTED UP AS FOR A GREAT DELIVERANCE AND CHILDREN RAN ALONG THE CANALS SHOUTING FOR JOY THAT THE DEVIL WAS DEAD EVEN ROYALISTS
WHY NOT BECAUSE I SCARCELY KNOW WHY
NOT BE IN SUCH A HURRY TO DO THAT SAID VALENTINE WITH A SAD SMILE IF SHE OBJECTS TO YOUR MARRYING M D'EPINAY SHE WOULD BE ALL THE MORE LIKELY TO LISTEN TO ANY OTHER PROPOSITION NO MAXIMILIAN IT IS NOT SUITORS TO WHICH MADAME DE VILLEFORT OBJECTS
BUT DO YOU NOT FEAR THAT THIS COMMUNICATION MAY RELATE TO YOUR MARRIAGE I DO NOT THINK THAT IS THE CASE HOWEVER IT MAY BE VALENTINE YOU MUST NOT BE ALARMED
AND INSTEAD OF IMMEDIATELY DIRECTING HER STEPS TOWARDS THE GATE SHE SEATED HERSELF ON A BENCH AND CAREFULLY CASTING HER EYES AROUND TO CONVINCE HERSELF THAT SHE WAS NOT WATCHED SHE PRESENTLY AROSE AND PROCEEDED QUICKLY TO JOIN MAXIMILIAN
BUT AS HE WAS NOT ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN POETICAL IDEAS HE HAD GONE INTO THE GARDEN AND WAS TALKING WITH MAJOR CAVALCANTI ON THE PROJECTED RAILWAY FROM LEGHORN TO FLORENCE MONTE CRISTO SEEMED IN DESPAIR
WHERE THE SHADE WAS THICKEST ALL THE OTHER GUESTS FOLLOWED
MONTE CRISTO NOTICED THE GENERAL ASTONISHMENT AND BEGAN LAUGHING AND JOKING ABOUT IT GENTLEMEN HE SAID YOU WILL ADMIT THAT WHEN ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN DEGREE OF FORTUNE THE SUPERFLUITIES OF LIFE ARE ALL THAT CAN BE DESIRED
AND HAVE YOU SUCCEEDED I THINK SO
AND YOU MORREL IN BREAKING A HORSE THAT NO ONE CAN RIDE FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE THESE TWO FISH
AND THAT HE LOST EXPRESSLY TO GIVE ME THE MEANS OF PROCURING HIM MY DEAR MAXIMILIAN YOU ARE REALLY TOO FANCIFUL YOU WILL NOT LOVE EVEN ME LONG A MAN WHO ACCUSTOMS HIMSELF TO LIVE IN SUCH A WORLD OF POETRY AND IMAGINATION
AND THEN SAID MONTE CRISTO THIS IS NOT ALL WHAT IS THERE MORE SAID DEBRAY WHO HAD NOT FAILED TO NOTICE THE AGITATION OF MADAME DANGLARS
AND I HAVE ALSO A DEEP CONVICTION THAT HEAVEN WOULD NOT HAVE CREATED TWO HEARTS HARMONIZING AS OURS DO AND ALMOST MIRACULOUSLY BROUGHT US TOGETHER TO SEPARATE US AT LAST THOSE ARE KIND AND CHEERING WORDS
THE OTHER FIVE LEAGUES FROM NAPLES IS IT NOT AMUSING TO SEE THEM BOTH ON THE SAME TABLE WHAT ARE THE TWO FISH ASKED DANGLARS
THOUGH INDEED I LIKE WELL TO USE THEM AND WILL PARKER WHO IS TEACHING ME SAYS THAT I SHOW RARE PROMISE BUT IT WOULD NEVER BE TO MY TASTE TO STAND ALL DAY SAWING AND SMOOTHING AND POLISHING ONE BOW IS TO ME MUCH LIKE ANOTHER THOUGH MY FATHER HOLDS THAT THERE ARE RARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM
DID IT NOT STRIKE YOU SIR KNIGHT THAT IT MIGHT ENTER MY MIND THAT IT WOULD BE VERY ADVISABLE FOR ME TO FREE MYSELF FROM ONE WHO STANDS TOWARDS ME IN THAT RELATION
OF ITALY AND THE LOW COUNTRIES WHILE FROM ABOVE THE GRAIN NEEDED FOR THE WANTS OF THE GREAT CITY WAS FLOATED DOWN IN BARGES FROM THE WEST
THE ROOF WAS FORMED OF AN OLD BOAT TURNED BOTTOM UPWARDS AND THIS HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BROWN TURF IT WAS AN EXCELLENT PLACE OF CONCEALMENT
LAY DOWN ON THE RUSHES IN FRONT OF THE FIRE FOR IN THOSE DAYS NONE OF THE WORKING OR ARTISAN CLASS USED BEDS WHICH WERE NOT INDEED FOR CENTURIES AFTERWARDS IN USAGE BY THE COMMON PEOPLE IN THE MORNING GEOFFREY WARD
THE HOUR IS LATE AND I SHALL BE HAVING THE WATCH COMING ALONG TO KNOW WHY I KEEP A FIRE SO LONG AFTER THE CURFEW SHOULD YOU BE A STRANGER IN THE CITY
HE HAD PARTICULARLY NOTICED HIM BECAUSE OF THE ARROGANT MANNER IN WHICH HE SPOKE WALTER HAD HIMSELF PUT IN THE RIVETS AND HAD THOUGHT AS HE BUCKLED ON THE ARMOUR AGAIN HOW UNPLEASANT A COUNTENANCE WAS THAT OF ITS WEARER
SO THAT HE MAY DO VALIANT DEEDS AND WIN BACK SOME DAY THE TITLE AND HONOUR OF HIS FAMILY GEOFFREY WARD LAUGHED
HER BROTHER WHO BUT A YEAR AGO BECAME LORD OF BROOMECASTLE AT THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER WAS ONE OF THE QUEEN'S MEN AND IT WAS HE I BELIEVE WHO BROUGHT SIR ROLAND SOMERS TO THAT SIDE HE WAS SLAIN ON THE SAME NIGHT AS MORTIMER
THEY SPOKE LITTLE MORE BUT THEIR HEAVY FOOTSTEPS ON THE SWAMPY GROUND WERE A SUFFICIENT GUIDANCE FOR HIM AT LAST
BIDDING HIM IN CASE I CAME NOT BACK TO SET A HUE AND CRY ON FOOT
THE LIGHTS CAME OUT BRIGHTLY FROM MANY OF THE CASEMENTS WITH SOUNDS OF BOISTEROUS SONGS AND LAUGHTER THE WOMAN PASSED THESE WITHOUT A PAUSE PRESENTLY SHE STOPPED BEFORE A COTTAGE FROM WHICH A FEEBLE LIGHT ALONE SHOWED THAT IT WAS TENANTED SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR
THAT WALTER WONDERED WHAT BUSINESS THERE MIGHT BE SCARCELY KNOWING WHY HE DID SO WALTER THREW HIMSELF DOWN AMONG SOME LOW BRUSHWOOD AND WATCHED THE APPROACHING FIGURE WHEN HE CAME NEAR
FOUND THAT HIS GUEST DESIRED TO FIND ONE GILES FLETCHER A MAKER OF BOWS I KNOW HIM WELL THE SMITH SAID THERE ARE MANY WHO DO A LARGER BUSINESS AND HOLD THEIR HEADS HIGHER BUT GILES FLETCHER IS WELL ESTEEMED AS A GOOD WORKMAN WHOSE WARES CAN BE DEPENDED UPON IT IS OFTEN SAID OF HIM
HE SAW A FIGURE MAKING HIS WAY ACROSS THE HOUR WAS ALREADY LATE AND THE NIGHT WAS FALLING AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE MAN WAS SO DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE USUAL DENIZENS OF THE SWAMP
WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY
AND I FELT A KIND OF PANIC ON SEEING THE PALE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON ILLUMINATE THE CHAMBER THE SHUTTERS HAD BEEN THROWN BACK AND WITH A SENSATION OF HORROR NOT TO BE DESCRIBED
THESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS YOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE FOLLOW ME I SEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH
FLUNG BY THE MURDERER ON ITS BRIDAL BIER COULD I BEHOLD THIS AND LIVE ALAS LIFE IS OBSTINATE AND CLINGS CLOSEST WHERE IT IS MOST HATED
WARM TEARS FILLED MY EYES WHICH I HASTILY WIPED AWAY THAT THEY MIGHT NOT INTERCEPT THE VIEW I HAD OF THE DAEMON BUT STILL MY SIGHT WAS DIMMED BY THE BURNING DROPS UNTIL
AS THE MECHANICAL IMPULSE OF SOME POWER OF WHICH I WAS UNCONSCIOUS THAN AS THE ARDENT DESIRE OF MY SOUL WHAT HIS FEELINGS WERE WHOM I PURSUED I CANNOT KNOW
HAVE YOURSELF DESCRIBED TO BE HIS PROPERTIES THAT THIS WILL PROVE IMPRACTICABLE AND THUS WHILE EVERY PROPER MEASURE IS PURSUED YOU SHOULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CANNOT BE
THE MURDER OF CLERVAL AND LASTLY OF MY WIFE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW NOT THAT MY ONLY REMAINING FRIENDS WERE SAFE FROM THE MALIGNITY OF THE FIEND
AS IF TO SEEK SOMETHING THAT I HAD LOST AFTER AN INTERVAL I AROSE AND AS IF BY INSTINCT CRAWLED INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE CORPSE OF MY BELOVED LAY THERE WERE WOMEN WEEPING AROUND I HUNG OVER IT
SUBJECTS REFLECTING CONFUSEDLY ON MY MISFORTUNES AND THEIR CAUSE I WAS BEWILDERED IN A CLOUD OF WONDER AND HORROR THE DEATH OF WILLIAM THE EXECUTION OF JUSTINE
CONCERNING THE FIEND AND GAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION A GIGANTIC MONSTER THEY SAID HAD ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE ARMED WITH A GUN AND MANY PISTOLS PUTTING TO FLIGHT THE INHABITANTS OF A SOLITARY COTTAGE
WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED MY NARRATION I SAID THIS IS THE BEING WHOM I ACCUSE AND FOR WHOSE SEIZURE AND PUNISHMENT I CALL UPON YOU TO EXERT YOUR WHOLE POWER
ONE INSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILS ONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTER UPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS
AND GAZED UPON ME WITH DILATED EYES AND QUICKENING BREATH
BEFORE ME WAS A SMALL PATCH OF MOONLIT SKY WHICH SHOWED THROUGH A RAGGED APERTURE AS MY HANDS PASSED OVER MY BODY THEY CAME IN CONTACT WITH POCKETS AND IN ONE OF THESE A SMALL PARCEL OF MATCHES WRAPPED IN OILED PAPER
WAS CONTENT THAT IT SHOULD BE SO THE CHILL OF THE MARTIAN NIGHT WAS UPON US AND REMOVING MY SILKS I THREW THEM ACROSS THE SHOULDERS OF DEJAH THORIS AS MY ARM RESTED FOR AN INSTANT UPON HER I FELT A THRILL PASS THROUGH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING
EVEN IN SECRECY IF NECESSARY HIS PROPERTY WAS LEFT IN SUCH A WAY THAT I WAS TO RECEIVE THE ENTIRE INCOME FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHEN THE PRINCIPAL WAS TO BECOME MINE
I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF OBSERVING A REGIMENT OF AS TRACTABLE AND DOCILE MOUNTS AS ONE MIGHT CARE TO SEE THE EFFECT ON THE PRECISION AND CELERITY OF THE MILITARY MOVEMENTS WAS SO REMARKABLE THAT LORQUAS PTOMEL PRESENTED ME WITH A MASSIVE
I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO KEEP US APART SHE CONTINUED FOR WHENEVER YOU HAVE BEEN OFF DUTY ONE OF THE OLDER WOMEN OF TARS TARKAS RETINUE HAS ALWAYS ARRANGED TO TRUMP UP SOME EXCUSE TO GET SOLA AND ME OUT OF SIGHT
OR THE SPEED AT WHICH I WAS TRAVELING MY CHANCES FOR FINDING IT WERE SLIM HELIUM LIES A THOUSAND MILES SOUTHWEST OF ZODANGA AND WITH MY COMPASS INTACT I SHOULD HAVE MADE THE TRIP
AND BY MEANS OF WHICH LANDING PARTIES ARE LOWERED TO THE GROUND FROM THE BATTLESHIPS I SWUNG THIS HOOK CAUTIOUSLY
THE BUILDING WAS AN ENORMOUS ONE REARING ITS LOFTY HEAD FULLY A THOUSAND FEET INTO THE AIR BUT FEW BUILDINGS IN ZODANGA WERE HIGHER THAN THESE BARRACKS THOUGH SEVERAL TOPPED IT BY A FEW HUNDRED FEET
BUT THE TRUTH SLOWLY FORCED ITSELF UPON ME I WAS LOOKING UPON ARIZONA FROM THE SAME LEDGE FROM WHICH TEN YEARS BEFORE I HAD GAZED WITH LONGING UPON MARS BURYING MY HEAD IN MY ARMS I TURNED
QUICK EXPLAIN YOURSELF OR I CALL THE GUARD LOOK YOU HERE SENTRY AND YOU SHALL SEE HOW I CAME
SHE SOLILOQUIZED IN CONCLUSION THEN SHE BROKE OUT AGAIN INTO ONE OF HER GAY HAPPY LAUGHING MOODS JOKING WITH ME ON MY PROWESS AS A THARK WARRIOR AS CONTRASTED WITH MY SOFT HEART AND NATURAL KINDLINESS I PRESUME
BUT I HOPE NEVERTHELESS THAT I MAY BE PRESENT THE NEXT TIME THAT ANY MARTIAN GREEN RED PINK OR VIOLET HAS THE TEMERITY TO EVEN SO MUCH AS FROWN ON YOU MY PRINCESS
LONGER THAN THE ACT OF ADJUSTING THE SILK REQUIRED SHE DID NOT DRAW AWAY NOR DID SHE SPEAK AND SO IN SILENCE WE WALKED THE SURFACE OF A DYING WORLD BUT IN THE BREAST OF ONE OF US AT LEAST HAD BEEN BORN THAT
HAD NOT THE MAN WHO HID THE MONEY BURIED IT IN THAT PRECISE SPOT THE GOLD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND THESE THEN ARE THE REASONS WHY THE FIND IS A CHANCE ONE IN THAT IT RESULTS FROM CAUSES WHICH MET TOGETHER AND CONCURRED
AT ALL AND IF SO WHAT IT IS THEN SHE MADE ANSWER I AM ANXIOUS TO FULFIL MY PROMISE COMPLETELY AND OPEN TO THEE A WAY OF RETURN TO THY NATIVE LAND
TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THE PRACTICE OF JUDGING AND CONDEMNING MORALLY IS THE FAVOURITE REVENGE OF THE INTELLECTUALLY SHALLOW ON THOSE WHO ARE LESS SO
AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS GENERALLY WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERN ORDINARY MEN INCLUDING THE CULTURED EVEN THE LEARNED AND PERHAPS PHILOSOPHERS ALSO IF APPEARANCES DO NOT DECEIVE
OUR ITCHING IS REALLY THE ITCHING FOR THE INFINITE THE IMMEASURABLE LIKE THE RIDER ON HIS FORWARD PANTING HORSE WE LET THE REINS FALL BEFORE THE INFINITE WE MODERN MEN WE SEMI BARBARIANS
AND IS THERE ANYTHING FINER THAN TO SEARCH FOR ONE'S OWN VIRTUES IS IT NOT ALMOST TO BELIEVE IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES BUT THIS BELIEVING IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES
FOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLING
THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
HONESTY GRANTING THAT IT IS THE VIRTUE OF WHICH WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES WE FREE SPIRITS WELL WE WILL LABOUR AT IT WITH ALL OUR PERVERSITY AND LOVE
AND ALSO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM US WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE FIRSTLINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY OUR MULTIFARIOUSNESS AND ART OF DISGUISING
IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S ART AND TASTE LIVES AS PERHAPS ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES WHERE WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE WE GO OUR WAY ENCHANTED AND VOLUNTARILY
BUT THE MEETING AND CONCURRENCE OF THESE CAUSES ARISES FROM THAT INEVITABLE CHAIN OF ORDER WHICH FLOWING FROM THE FOUNTAIN HEAD OF PROVIDENCE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IN THEIR DUE TIME AND PLACE
LIKE WATER FLOWING INTO CREVICES AND CRANNIES LIKE WATER RISING SILENTLY EVEN WITH THE RIM EIGHT HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN WITH FAITH AND HOPES WITH AFFECTIONS AND MEMORIES THEY HAD COLLECTED THERE
DISABLED BY A FALLING SPAR AT THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK OF WHICH HIS SCOTTISH CAPTAIN USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS MAN IT'S A PAIRFECT MEERACLE TO ME HOW SHE LIVED THROUGH IT SPENT MANY DAYS STRETCHED ON HIS BACK DAZED BATTERED HOPELESS
HE ASSOCIATED NATURALLY WITH THE MEN OF HIS CALLING IN THE PORT THESE WERE OF TWO KINDS SOME VERY FEW AND SEEN THERE BUT SELDOM LED MYSTERIOUS LIVES
AT HIS BACK WAS THE DARK NIGHT WITH THE CLEAR STARS WHOSE DISTANT GLITTER DISPOSED IN RETREATING PLANES LURED THE EYE INTO THE DEPTHS OF A GREATER DARKNESS
BUT IT WASN'T TRUTH ALL THE SAME IT WAS SOMETHING ONE KNOWS A DOWNRIGHT LIE THERE WAS NOT THE THICKNESS OF A SHEET OF PAPER BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG OF THIS AFFAIR
THE TIMID WOMEN MUFFLED UP AND CLASPING TO THEIR BREASTS WRAPPED IN LOOSE ENDS OF SOILED HEAD CLOTHS THEIR SLEEPING BABIES THE UNCONSCIOUS PILGRIMS OF AN EXACTING BELIEF
HIS FINGERS PLAYED INCESSANTLY TOUCHING THE PAPER WITHOUT NOISE I DID NOT THINK OF DANGER JUST THEN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE STARTLED ALL THIS HAPPENED IN SUCH A QUIET WAY AND SO VERY SUDDENLY
COMING FROM NORTH AND SOUTH AND FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE EAST AFTER TREADING THE JUNGLE PATHS DESCENDING THE RIVERS COASTING IN PRAUS ALONG THE SHALLOWS CROSSING IN SMALL CANOES FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND PASSING THROUGH SUFFERING
THE BIG FRAMEWORK OF PUNKAHS MOVED GENTLY TO AND FRO HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND FROM BELOW MANY EYES WERE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF DARK FACES OUT OF WHITE FACES OUT OF RED FACES OUT OF FACES ATTENTIVE SPELLBOUND
AND YET A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT SEEMED TO SHOW ME HIS BOYISH HEAD AS IF IN THAT MOMENT THE YOUTH WITHIN HIM HAD FOR A MOMENT GLOWED AND EXPIRED YOU ARE AN AWFUL GOOD SORT TO LISTEN
AS IF ALL THESE PEOPLE SITTING IN ORDERLY ROWS UPON NARROW BENCHES HAD BEEN ENSLAVED BY THE FASCINATION OF HIS VOICE IT WAS VERY LOUD IT RANG STARTLING IN HIS OWN EARS IT WAS THE ONLY SOUND AUDIBLE IN THE WORLD
HE HAD COME ACROSS THAT MAN BEFORE IN THE STREET PERHAPS HE WAS POSITIVE HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM FOR DAYS FOR MANY DAYS HE HAD SPOKEN TO NO ONE BUT HAD HELD SILENT INCOHERENT AND ENDLESS CONVERSE WITH HIMSELF
AND IN ESSAYING TO GATHER SOME EXPERIENCE I AT LENGTH RESOLVED TO MAKE MYSELF AN OBJECT OF STUDY AND TO EMPLOY ALL THE POWERS OF MY MIND IN CHOOSING THE PATHS I OUGHT TO FOLLOW
AND IT IS BUT A LITTLE COPPER AND GLASS PERHAPS THAT I TAKE FOR GOLD AND DIAMONDS I KNOW HOW VERY LIABLE WE ARE TO DELUSION IN WHAT RELATES TO OURSELVES AND ALSO HOW MUCH THE JUDGMENTS OF OUR FRIENDS ARE TO BE SUSPECTED WHEN GIVEN IN OUR FAVOR
THERE WILL BE FOUND PERHAPS AS MANY MORE WHICH IT WERE ADVISABLE NOT TO FOLLOW I HOPE IT WILL PROVE USEFUL TO SOME WITHOUT BEING HURTFUL TO ANY AND THAT MY OPENNESS WILL FIND SOME FAVOR WITH ALL
THERE ARE THICK SOFT CARPETS ON THE FLOORS THE DISHES ARE MADE OF SILVER AND THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF GOOD THINGS TO EAT AND DRINK SPECIAL THINGS
THAT PHILOSOPHY AFFORDS THE MEANS OF DISCOURSING WITH AN APPEARANCE OF TRUTH ON ALL MATTERS AND COMMANDS THE ADMIRATION OF THE MORE SIMPLE THAT JURISPRUDENCE MEDICINE AND THE OTHER SCIENCES SECURE FOR THEIR CULTIVATORS HONORS AND RICHES AND IN FINE
AND NOTHING THEREFORE WHICH IS ABOVE DOUBT I DID NOT PRESUME TO ANTICIPATE THAT MY SUCCESS WOULD BE GREATER IN IT THAN THAT OF OTHERS AND FURTHER WHEN I CONSIDERED THE NUMBER OF CONFLICTING OPINIONS TOUCHING A SINGLE MATTER
THIS IS DAB DAB ONE OF MY PETS I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT DUCKS HAD A LANGUAGE SAID THE BOY ARE ALL THESE OTHER ANIMALS YOUR PETS TOO WHAT IS THAT STRANGE LOOKING THING WITH TWO HEADS
THAN THAT THEY FOSTER HIS VANITY THE BETTER THE MORE REMOTE THEY ARE FROM COMMON SENSE REQUIRING AS THEY MUST IN THIS CASE THE EXERCISE OF GREATER INGENUITY AND ART TO RENDER THEM PROBABLE IN ADDITION
BUT BEING GIVEN ASSUREDLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WAY IS NOT LESS OPEN TO THE MOST IGNORANT THAN TO THE MOST LEARNED AND THAT THE REVEALED TRUTHS WHICH LEAD TO HEAVEN ARE ABOVE OUR COMPREHENSION I DID NOT PRESUME TO SUBJECT THEM TO THE IMPOTENCY OF MY REASON
GOOD SENSE IS OF ALL THINGS AMONG MEN THE MOST EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED FOR EVERY ONE THINKS HIMSELF SO ABUNDANTLY PROVIDED WITH IT
IF READ WITH DISCRETION AID IN FORMING THE JUDGMENT THAT THE PERUSAL OF ALL EXCELLENT BOOKS IS AS IT WERE TO INTERVIEW WITH THE NOBLEST MEN OF PAST AGES WHO HAVE WRITTEN THEM AND EVEN A STUDIED INTERVIEW IN WHICH ARE DISCOVERED TO US
SO THAT THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE I DERIVED FROM THE STUDY CONSISTED IN THIS THAT OBSERVING MANY THINGS WHICH HOWEVER EXTRAVAGANT AND RIDICULOUS TO OUR APPREHENSION
IF THE POOR FELLOW'S UNHAPPY WE'VE GOT TO GET IN AND SEE WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM
THESE DERANGEMENTS ARE THE BASIS OF EMOTION ITS PHYSICAL BASIS AND TO BE MOVED IS TO PERCEIVE THEM TAKE AWAY FROM THE CONSCIOUSNESS THIS PHYSICAL REFLEX AND EMOTION CEASES IT IS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT AN IDEA
ALL JUDGEMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE EXAMINATION THAT IS INVESTIGATION INTO THE GROUNDS OF THEIR TRUTH FOR WHEN THEY ARE IMMEDIATELY CERTAIN FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN TWO POINTS THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE STRAIGHT LINE
THUS IN THE CASE OF TWO DROPS OF WATER
IF A GENERAL JUDGEMENT IS TO BE CONSTRUCTED OR DIFFERENCE IF A PARTICULAR WHETHER THERE IS AGREEMENT WHEN AFFIRMATIVE AND OPPOSITION WHEN NEGATIVE JUDGEMENTS ARE TO BE CONSTRUCTED AND SO ON FOR THIS REASON WE OUGHT TO CALL THESE CONCEPTIONS
CONSEQUENTLY AS INTELLIGIBILIA THAT IS OBJECTS OF PURE UNDERSTANDING ALTHOUGH ON ACCOUNT OF THE CONFUSED NATURE OF THEIR REPRESENTATIONS HE GAVE THEM THE NAME OF PHENOMENA AND IN THIS CASE HIS PRINCIPLE OF THE INDISCERNIBLE
HE IMAGIN'D IT IS PLAIN THAT IT WOULD DO HIM MORE HONOUR THAN HIS OWN GREEN ONE UNACCOUTRED AS I AM I AM READY BEFORE THIS AUGUST ASSEMBLY TO GIVE THEM INCONTESTABLE PROOF OF MY SUPERIOR SKILL
THE ACT WHEREBY I COMPARE MY REPRESENTATIONS WITH THE FACULTY OF COGNITION WHICH ORIGINATES THEM AND WHEREBY I DISTINGUISH WHETHER THEY ARE COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER AS BELONGING TO THE PURE UNDERSTANDING OR TO SENSUOUS INTUITION I TERM TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION
THEY PROCEED FROM THE FACT THAT STUDIES ON THE NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS ARE STILL VERY LITTLE ADVANCED THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OF THESE STATES ARE PRETTY WELL KNOWN AND THEIR PSYCHICAL AND SOCIAL EFFECTS HAVE BEEN ABUNDANTLY DESCRIBED
OUR SENTIMENTS OUR EMOTIONS AND OUR PASSIONS IT IS UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED THAT THESE STATES ARE OF A MENTAL NATURE
OPPOSITION BETWEEN REALITIES IS INCOGITABLE SUCH A RELATION THAT IS
OR ELSE IT IS THE SECRETION OF THE SALIVA OR OF THE SWEAT WHICH FLOWS IN ABUNDANCE OR DRIES UP OR THE MUSCULAR FORCE WHICH IS INCREASED OR DECAYS
COMPARATIO BUT ONLY BY DISTINGUISHING THE MODE OF COGNITION TO WHICH THEY BELONG IN OTHER WORDS BY MEANS OF TRANSCENDENTAL REFLECTION WE MAY THEREFORE WITH JUSTICE SAY THAT LOGICAL REFLECTION IS MERE COMPARISON
TO ENGAGE WITH THE USURPER OF THE WHITE ARMOUR WITH MY SWORD ONLY IN MY MANTLE AND BONNET AND TO TESTIFY THAT I ONLY WAS THE HAPPY VICTOR OF THE JUSTLY ADMIRED HOTTAM
DEFINITION OF THE EMOTIONS AFTER SENSATIONS AND IMAGES WE HAVE TO NAME AMONG THE PHENOMENA OF CONSCIOUSNESS THE WHOLE SERIES OF AFFECTIVE STATES OUR PLEASURES AND OUR PAINS OUR JOYS AND OUR GRIEFS
WAS WORK NO SOUND MAN EVER EQUALLED AND SO THINKS THE DOCTOR AS IT WAS HE WAS ALREADY THIRTY YARDS BEHIND US AND ON THE VERGE OF STRANGLING WHEN WE REACHED THE BROW OF THE SLOPE DOCTOR HE HAILED SEE THERE
WELL WHAT IS IT ANYWAY AH DEPOSED' THAT'S IT IS IT VERY PRETTY WROTE TO BE SURE LIKE PRINT I SWEAR YOUR HAND O WRITE GEORGE
THE APPEARANCE OF THE CHART WAS INCREDIBLE TO THE SURVIVING MUTINEERS THEY LEAPED UPON IT LIKE CATS UPON A MOUSE IT WENT FROM HAND TO HAND ONE TEARING IT FROM ANOTHER AND BY THE OATHS AND THE CRIES AND THE CHILDISH LAUGHTER WITH WHICH THEY ACCOMPANIED THEIR EXAMINATION
I BEHELD GREAT HEAPS OF COIN AND QUADRILATERALS BUILT OF BARS OF GOLD THAT WAS FLINT'S TREASURE THAT WE HAD COME SO FAR TO SEEK AND THAT HAD COST ALREADY THE LIVES OF SEVENTEEN MEN FROM THE HISPANIOLA
WHAT SHOULD WE MEET BUT THE HISPANIOLA CRUISING BY HERSELF THE LAST FLOOD HAD LIFTED HER AND HAD THERE BEEN MUCH WIND OR A STRONG TIDE CURRENT AS IN THE SOUTHERN ANCHORAGE WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FOUND HER MORE OR FOUND HER STRANDED BEYOND HELP
THE PICTURES OF ALL THE KINGS OF EUROPE FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS STRANGE ORIENTAL PIECES STAMPED WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE WISPS OF STRING OR BITS OF SPIDER'S WEB
AND PRECIOUS LITTLE ODDS WHICH TO YOU AND ME I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD HARDLY ASK ME TO CALL YOU A HUMANE MAN RETURNED THE DOCTOR WITH A SNEER AND SO MY FEELINGS MAY SURPRISE YOU MASTER SILVER
I MADE A HASH O THIS CRUISE DID I WELL NOW YOU ALL KNOW WHAT I WANTED AND YOU ALL KNOW IF THAT HAD BEEN DONE THAT WE'D A BEEN ABOARD THE HISPANIOLA THIS NIGHT AS EVER WAS EVERY MAN OF US ALIVE AND FIT AND FULL OF GOOD PLUM DUFF
TO PASS THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT HERE THEY MET THE CAPTAIN OF AN ENGLISH MAN OF WAR FELL IN TALK WITH HIM WENT ON BOARD HIS SHIP AND IN SHORT HAD SO AGREEABLE A TIME THAT DAY WAS BREAKING WHEN WE CAME ALONGSIDE THE HISPANIOLA
AND THE ARMS STILL LIE FOR ALL THAT I KNOW WHERE FLINT BURIED THEM AND CERTAINLY THEY SHALL LIE THERE FOR ME
KILL THAT BOY NOT ME MATES AND NUMBER THREE AH WELL THERE'S A DEAL TO SAY TO NUMBER THREE MAYBE YOU DON'T COUNT IT NOTHING TO HAVE A REAL COLLEGE DOCTOR TO SEE YOU EVERY DAY YOU JOHN WITH YOUR HEAD BROKE
ARE WE A GOING TO WASTE A HOSTAGE NO NOT US
WHO WAS STILL TERRIBLY AFRAID OF HIS OLD QUARTERMASTER OR MYSELF WHO HAD REALLY SOMETHING TO THANK HIM FOR ALTHOUGH FOR THAT MATTER I SUPPOSE I HAD REASON TO THINK EVEN WORSE OF HIM THAN ANYBODY ELSE
AND AS IT WAS WHAT WITH BAFFLING WINDS AND A COUPLE OF FRESH GALES WE WERE ALL WORN OUT BEFORE WE REACHED IT IT WAS JUST AT SUNDOWN WHEN WE CAST ANCHOR IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL LAND LOCKED GULF
THE EVENING CAME AND THE DRESSING BELL FOR DINNER RANG BEFORE MISTER FRANKLIN RETURNED FROM FRIZINGHALL I TOOK HIS HOT WATER UP TO HIS ROOM MYSELF EXPECTING TO HEAR AFTER THIS EXTRAORDINARY DELAY
BUT THE BROAD MOONLIGHT SHOWED FAIR ON THE GRAVEL WALK THAT RAN ALONG THE NEXT SIDE TO THE TERRACE LOOKING THIS WAY AFTER LOOKING UP AT THE SKY I SAW THE SHADOW OF A PERSON IN THE MOONLIGHT THROWN FORWARD FROM BEHIND THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE
UNEASY IN MYSELF THE MOMENT SHE HAD SPOKEN THEM BUT SO IT WAS WE WILL CHANGE THE SUBJECT IF YOU PLEASE I AM SORRY I DRIFTED INTO WRITING ABOUT IT AND NOT WITHOUT REASON
AND SHE HAD COME TO MY COTTAGE TO WHEEDLE ME IF I MAY USE SUCH AN EXPRESSION INTO GIVING UP MY HARD OUT OF DOOR WORK AS BAILIFF AND TAKING MY EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AS STEWARD IN THE HOUSE I MADE AS GOOD A FIGHT OF IT
A LITTLE BRIGHT OBJECT LYING ON THE CLEAN GRAVEL UNDER THE LIGHT OF THE MOON PICKING THE OBJECT UP I DISCOVERED IT WAS A SMALL BOTTLE CONTAINING A THICK SWEET SMELLING LIQUOR AS BLACK AS INK
IS A REAL COMFORT AT STARTING IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF THE FASHIONABLE WORLD YOU HAVE HEARD TELL OF THE THREE BEAUTIFUL MISS HERNCASTLES MISS ADELAIDE MISS CAROLINE
I WAS LEFT WITH MY LITTLE GIRL PENELOPE AND WITH NO OTHER CHILD SHORTLY AFTERWARDS SIR JOHN DIED AND MY LADY WAS LEFT WITH HER LITTLE GIRL MISS RACHEL AND NO OTHER CHILD I HAVE WRITTEN TO VERY POOR PURPOSE OF MY LADY
IN CASES OF DOUBT AND EMERGENCY I SMOKED A PIPE AND TOOK A TURN AT ROBINSON CRUSOE
AFTER LEAVING MISTER FRANKLIN AND ME AT THE SHIVERING SAND ROSANNA IT APPEARED HAD RETURNED TO THE HOUSE IN A VERY UNACCOUNTABLE STATE OF MIND SHE HAD TURNED IF PENELOPE WAS TO BE BELIEVED ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW
THE NEWS BROUGHT TO ME FROM THE UPPER REGIONS THAT EVENING CAME FROM PENELOPE AND THE FOOTMAN PENELOPE MENTIONED THAT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN MISS RACHEL SO PARTICULAR ABOUT THE DRESSING OF HER HAIR AND HAD NEVER SEEN HER LOOK SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY
DESCRIBING IT MERELY AS A VALUABLE OF GREAT PRICE AND HE HAD GOT THE RECEIPT FOR IT SAFE IN HIS POCKET I WENT DOWN STAIRS
AND SO THE WARDEN RETIRED BUT AS HE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM HE HEARD THE WELL KNOWN EJACULATION
I SAID NOTHING TO SAMUEL BUT REMEMBERING WHAT PENELOPE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT THE JUGGLERS AND THE POURING OF THE LITTLE POOL OF INK INTO THE PALM OF THE BOY'S HAND
ARE RESERVED TO THE STATES RESPECTIVELY OR TO THE PEOPLE NOW IT SO HAPPENS THAT THESE AMENDMENTS WERE FRAMED BY THE FIRST CONGRESS WHICH SAT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION THE IDENTICAL CONGRESS WHICH PASSED THE ACT ALREADY MENTIONED
THOSE WHO NOW INSIST THAT FEDERAL CONTROL OF SLAVERY IN FEDERAL TERRITORIES VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION POINT US TO THE PROVISIONS WHICH THEY SUPPOSE IT THUS VIOLATES AND AS I UNDERSTAND
ACCORDING TO THE PRACTICE OF OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE NOT ONE OF ALL YOUR VARIOUS PLANS CAN SHOW A PRECEDENT OR AN ADVOCATE IN THE CENTURY WITHIN WHICH OUR GOVERNMENT ORIGINATED CONSIDER THEN
I HAVE PURPOSELY OMITTED WHATEVER UNDERSTANDING MAY HAVE BEEN MANIFESTED BY ANY PERSON HOWEVER DISTINGUISHED OTHER THAN THE THIRTY NINE FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AND FOR THE SAME REASON
INCLUDING SIXTEEN OF THE FRAMERS OF THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION AS BEFORE STATED WERE PRE EMINENTLY OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THAT PART OF THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE WHICH IS NOW CLAIMED AS FORBIDDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL SLAVERY IN THE FEDERAL TERRITORIES
HAD UNDER CONSIDERATION AND IN PROGRESS TOWARD MATURITY THESE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AND THIS ACT PROHIBITING SLAVERY IN ALL THE TERRITORY THE NATION THEN OWNED THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WERE INTRODUCED BEFORE
IN THIS CONGRESS THERE WERE SIXTEEN OF THE THIRTY NINE FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION THEY WERE JOHN LANGDON NICHOLAS GILMAN WM S JOHNNSON ROGER SHERMAN ROBERT MORRIS THOS FITZSIMMONS
BUT HE HAS NO RIGHT TO MISLEAD OTHERS WHO HAVE LESS ACCESS TO HISTORY AND LESS LEISURE TO STUDY IT INTO THE FALSE BELIEF THAT OUR FATHERS WHO FRAMED THE GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH WE LIVE WERE OF THE SAME OPINION
THEY ALL PROBABLY VOTED FOR IT CERTAINLY THEY WOULD HAVE PLACED THEIR OPPOSITION TO IT UPON RECORD IF IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING ANY LINE DIVIDING LOCAL FROM FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR ANYTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION
THAT FAULT IS PRIMARILY YOURS
BETTER THAN WE LET US NOW INQUIRE WHETHER THE THIRTY NINE OR ANY OF THEM
I DO NOT MEAN TO SAY WE ARE BOUND TO FOLLOW IMPLICITLY IN WHATEVER OUR FATHERS DID TO DO SO WOULD BE TO DISCARD ALL THE LIGHTS OF CURRENT EXPERIENCE TO REJECT ALL PROGRESS ALL IMPROVEMENT
FORBADE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL AS TO SLAVERY IN THE FEDERAL TERRITORIES THUS THE TWENTY ONE ACTED AND AS ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS SO ACTIONS UNDER SUCH RESPONSIBILITIES SPEAK STILL LOUDER
THE ARCHBISHOP OF MAGDEBURG PRIMATE OF GERMANY A MAN TOTALLY UNINTERESTED EITHER WAY AND KNOWN FOR HIS PROBITY WOULD NOT THEY SAY HAVE RECOGNISED AND HAVE GIVEN HIS TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF THE CLAIMANT
AND WHEN THE LIONS WERE QUIETED HE WENT ON THROUGH THE CASTLE AND CAME AT LENGTH TO A BEAUTIFUL HALL AROUND IT HE SAW SEVERAL KNIGHTS SITTING IN A TRANCE THEN HE PULLED OFF THEIR RINGS
AFTER THEY HAD BEEN LEFT TOGETHER FOR A FEW MINUTES THEY CAME OUT AND THREW THEMSELVES INTO ONE ANOTHER'S ARMS IN THE FULL VIEW OF THE ENORMOUS MULTITUDE WHICH HAD ASSEMBLED
WHEN THE FIRST JOY AT THEIR MEETING WAS OVER THE PRINCESS TOLD HIM SHE HAD HEARD OF HIS FATHER HAVING FORGIVEN HIM AND OF HIS WISH TO HAVE HIM HOME AGAIN SO BEFORE HIS WEDDING WITH THE PRINCESS HE WENT TO VISIT HIS FATHER
IN ORDER TO AFFORD A FAIR IDEA OF THIS PRETENDER'S CLAIMS IT WILL BE NECESSARY IN THE FIRST PLACE TO RECOUNT THE STORY OF HIS APPEARANCE AS DETAILED BY THE AUTHORS FAVOURING THE THEORY OF HIS BEING AN IMPOSTOR AND THEN
WHICH WAS A BRANCH OF THE ASCAGNE FAMILY THIS WAS A D THIRTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR DAYS AFTER VOLDEMAR'S DEPARTURE HIS BROTHER JOHN DIED SUDDENLY NOT WITHOUT SUSPICION THAT HE HAD BEEN POISONED
THE MAN HE ASSERTED HIMSELF TO BE NOT ONLY AUTHORS INK BUT UNFORTUNATELY A GREAT QUANTITY OF HUMAN BLOOD WAS WASTED IN THE DISPUTE AND THAT TOO
THEY WILL LET YOU PASS THEN HASTEN ON TO THE WELL AND TAKE SOME OF THE WATER OF LIFE BEFORE THE CLOCK STRIKES TWELVE FOR IF YOU TARRY LONGER THE DOOR WILL SHUT UPON YOU FOR EVER THEN
WHO SET OUT IN SEARCH OF THE WATER OF LIFE BEFORE ME AND NEVER CAME BACK I HAVE SHUT THEM UP BY A CHARM BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS SAID THE DWARF BECAUSE THEY WERE PROUD AND ILL BEHAVED AND SCORNED TO ASK ADVICE
IN A STATE OF INTENSE EXCITEMENT TO SEE
AND TAUNTED HIM AS TO HIS BIRTH THE WRETCHED MAN COLLECTING HIS STRENGTH EXCLAIMED I AM YOUR CZAR THE SON OF IVAN VASSILIEVITCH WHEN HIS AGONY WAS TERMINATED BY A SHOT FROM AN ARQUEBUSS
TO THINK THAT HE HAD GOT THE WATER OF LIFE AND AS HE WAS GOING ON HIS WAY HOMEWARDS HE PASSED BY THE LITTLE DWARF WHO WHEN HE SAW THE SWORD AND THE LOAF SAID YOU HAVE MADE A NOBLE PRIZE WITH THE SWORD YOU CAN AT A BLOW
BUT THIS MIRACULOUS INTERPOSITION DID NOT SATISFY EVERYBODY AND WHILST THE PARTIZANS OF THE LATE CZAR WERE AFFIRMING THAT A BODY HAD BEEN SUBSTITUTED FOR THE OCCASION THE WHOLE COUNTRY WAS ROUSED TO A STATE OF FRENZY
AND TO COME LIKE ADORABLE RECRUITS ENLISTED BY A SERGEANT NOT PRESENT FOR ON ARRIVING AT THE VENEERING DEPOT THEY ARE IN A BARRACK OF STRANGERS SO TWEMLOW GOES HOME TO DUKE STREET SAINT JAMES'S TO TAKE A PLATE OF MUTTON BROTH WITH A CHOP IN IT
SPLENDID BRACELET PRODUCED BY VENEERING BEFORE GOING DOWN AND CLASPED UPON THE ARM OF BRIDE YET NOBODY SEEMS TO THINK MUCH MORE OF THE VENEERINGS THAN IF THEY WERE A TOLERABLE LANDLORD AND LANDLADY DOING THE THING IN THE WAY OF BUSINESS AT SO MUCH A HEAD
CAN'T WE UNITED PRETEND TO THE WORLD AGREED SECONDLY WE OWE THE VENEERINGS A GRUDGE AND WE OWE ALL OTHER PEOPLE THE GRUDGE OF WISHING THEM TO BE TAKEN IN AS WE OURSELVES HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN AGREED YES AGREED
AND THAT THEY HAVE WALKED IN A MOODY HUMOUR FOR THE LADY HAS PRODDED LITTLE SPIRTING HOLES IN THE DAMP SAND BEFORE HER WITH HER PARASOL AND THE GENTLEMAN HAS TRAILED HIS STICK AFTER HIM
A WASTE A WASTE A WASTE MY TWEMLOW
BROODING OVER THE FIRE WITH HIS DRIED LITTLE HEAD IN HIS DRIED LITTLE HANDS AND HIS DRIED LITTLE ELBOWS ON HIS DRIED LITTLE KNEES TWEMLOW IS MELANCHOLY NO ADORABLE TO BEAR ME COMPANY HERE THINKS HE NO ADORABLE AT THE CLUB
THAT THE POKEY UNKNOWNS SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN BEING UNIMPRESSIBLE THEY PERSIST IN NOT BEING FRIGHTENED BY THE GOLD AND SILVER CAMELS AND THEY ARE BANDED TOGETHER TO DEFY THE ELABORATELY CHASED ICE PAILS THEY EVEN SEEM TO UNITE IN SOME VAGUE UTTERANCE OF THE SENTIMENT
OH THINKS TWEMLOW WITH HIS EYES WANDERING THEN THERE ARE THREE OF US AND SHE'S THE OTHER MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD RESUMES VENEERING WHOM YOU BOTH KNOW IS OUT OF TOWN BUT HE WRITES IN HIS WHIMSICAL MANNER
THOSE LOVELY BEINGS BECOME EACH ONE OF HER OWN ACCOUNT DEPRECIATINGLY CONTEMPLATIVE OF THE MILLINERY PRESENT WHILE THE BRIDEGROOM'S MAN EXHAUSTED IN THE BACK OF HIS CHAIR APPEARS TO BE IMPROVING THE OCCASION BY PENITENTIALLY CONTEMPLATING ALL THE WRONG HE HAS EVER DONE
WHAT OF IT SAYS MISTER LAMMLE HAVE YOU THE FACE TO UTTER THE WORD TO ME THE FACE TOO REPLIED MISSUS LAMMLE STARING AT HIM WITH COLD SCORN PRAY HOW DARE YOU SIR UTTER THE WORD TO ME I NEVER DID
WITH A HEAVY SHOE WHICH A BUFFER IN THE HALL CHAMPAGNE FLUSHED AND WILD OF AIM HAS BORROWED ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT FROM THE PASTRYCOOK'S PORTER TO CAST AFTER THE DEPARTING PAIR AS AN AUSPICIOUS OMEN SO THEY ALL GO UP AGAIN INTO THE GORGEOUS DRAWING ROOMS
WITH A SMACK AND A RELISH
DO I MEAN TO TELL YOU DO I MEAN TO TELL YOU WHAT THAT YOU ARE A MAN OF PROPERTY NO THEN YOU MARRIED ME ON FALSE PRETENCES SO BE IT NEXT COMES WHAT YOU MEAN TO SAY
YOU MUST BE LET A LITTLE MORE INTO OUR AFFAIRS ROKESMITH I MENTIONED TO YOU WHEN I MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE OR I MIGHT BETTER SAY WHEN YOU MADE MINE
BUT CONSIDER SUCH A NIGHT FOR PLUMAGE SUCH A NIGHT REPEATED MORTIMER WHAT BECAME OF YOU IN THE MORNING MY DEAR FELLOW SAID EUGENE SITTING ON HIS BED I FELT THAT WE HAD BORED ONE ANOTHER SO LONG
TOOK IT MY LITERARY MAN WAS SO FRIENDLY AS TO DROP INTO A CHARMING PIECE OF POETRY ON THAT OCCASION IN WHICH HE COMPLIMENTED MISSUS BOFFIN ON COMING INTO POSSESSION OF HOW DID IT GO MY DEAR MISSUS BOFFIN REPLIED THE GAY
HE POINTED BEHIND HIM AT THE BOAT AND GASPED TO THAT DEGREE THAT HE DROPPED UPON THE STONES TO GET HIS BREATH GAFFER'S DONE ME IT'S GAFFER THEY RAN TO THE ROPE LEAVING HIM GASPING THERE SOON THE FORM OF THE BIRD OF PREY
THAT HE DROPPED UNDER THE LEE OF A TIER OF SHIPPING AND THEY LAY THERE UNTIL IT WAS OVER THE SQUALL HAD COME UP LIKE A SPITEFUL MESSENGER BEFORE THE MORNING THERE FOLLOWED IN ITS WAKE A RAGGED TEAR OF LIGHT WHICH RIPPED THE DARK CLOUDS UNTIL THEY SHOWED A GREAT GREY HOLE OF DAY
WORDS NEVER TO BE ANSWERED THOSE UPON THE EARTH SIDE OF THE GRAVE THE WIND SWEEPS JEERINGLY OVER FATHER WHIPS HIM WITH THE FRAYED ENDS OF HIS DRESS AND HIS JAGGED HAIR
BUT SEEMED TO BE THERE WITH A FELL INTENTION NOT A FIGURE HEAD BUT HAD THE MENACING LOOK OF BURSTING FORWARD TO RUN THEM DOWN NOT A SLUICE GATE
SO MUCH COACH MAKER'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH HORSE DEALER'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH HARNESS MAKER'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH GOLDSMITH'S ESTIMATE SO MUCH TOTAL SO VERY MUCH THEN CAME CORRESPONDENCE
THAT HE HAD HAD HALF A DOZEN DEAD AND ALIVE IN HER AFORE NOW AND SHE WAS NOTHING DEEP IN THE WATER NOR DOWN IN THE STERN EVEN THEN TO SPEAK OF THEY CAREFULLY TOOK THEIR PLACES AND TRIMMED THE CRAZY THING WHILE THEY WERE DOING SO RIDERHOOD STILL SAT STARING DISCONSOLATE
WITH A MORBID EXPECTATION MURMURED EUGENE TO LIGHTWOOD THAT SOMEBODY IS ALWAYS GOING TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH THIS IS HEXAM'S BOAT SAID MISTER INSPECTOR
THAT THE OFFICER TOOK UPON HIMSELF TO PREPARE THE DEAD MAN'S DAUGHTER FOR WHAT HAD BEFALLEN IN THE NIGHT AND GENERALLY THAT HE TOOK EVERYTHING UPON HIMSELF MORTIMER LIGHTWOOD STUMBLED IN HIS SLEEP TO A CAB STAND CALLED A CAB
ACCEPTANCE OF MISTER BOFFIN'S OFFER OF SUCH A DATE AND TO SUCH AN EFFECT REJECTION OF MISTER BOFFIN'S PROPOSAL OF SUCH A DATE AND TO SUCH AN EFFECT CONCERNING MISTER BOFFIN'S SCHEME OF SUCH ANOTHER DATE TO SUCH ANOTHER EFFECT ALL COMPACT AND METHODICAL
LOOK AT THE BROKEN SCULL LOOK AT THE T'OTHER SCULL GONE NOW TELL ME I AM A LIAR SAID THE HONEST MAN MISTER INSPECTOR STEPPED INTO THE BOAT EUGENE AND MORTIMER LOOKED ON AND SEE NOW
THE LIBERAL MINISTRY AT LEAST DESERVES CREDIT FOR HAVING STEERED THE COUNTRY SAFELY THROUGH PERILOUS WATERS
AND LADY STANLEY DID YOU EVER READ THE WONDERFUL LAST CHAPTER OF THAT BOOK ABOUT HER HUSBAND THESE ARE THE SORT OF MEN THAT A WOMAN COULD WORSHIP WITH ALL HER SOUL AND YET BE THE GREATER NOT THE LESS ON ACCOUNT OF HER LOVE
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO YOU SIR SCIENTIFIC GIBBERISH DID YOU THINK YOU COULD MATCH CUNNING WITH ME YOU WITH YOUR WALNUT OF A BRAIN YOU THINK YOU ARE OMNIPOTENT YOU INFERNAL SCRIBBLERS DON'T YOU
GLADYS WAS FULL OF EVERY WOMANLY QUALITY SOME JUDGED HER TO BE COLD AND HARD BUT SUCH A THOUGHT WAS TREASON THAT DELICATELY BRONZED SKIN
THAT WAS BRAVE OF YOU I HAD TO IF YOU WANT TO WRITE GOOD COPY YOU MUST BE WHERE THE THINGS ARE WHAT A PROSAIC MOTIVE IT SEEMS TO TAKE ALL THE ROMANCE OUT OF IT BUT STILL
I SUPPOSE YOU ARE AWARE SAID HE CHECKING OFF POINTS UPON HIS FINGERS THAT THE CRANIAL INDEX IS A CONSTANT FACTOR NATURALLY SAID
IT IS MOST CONSIDERATE OF YOU MADAM GET QUICKLY OUT OF THE ROOM IF HE SEEMS INCLINED TO BE VIOLENT DON'T WAIT TO ARGUE WITH HIM SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED THROUGH DOING THAT AFTERWARDS THERE IS A PUBLIC SCANDAL AND IT REFLECTS UPON ME AND ALL OF US
WHICH WAS REJECTED BY THE FIRST CHAMBER A DISSOLUTION OF THIS CHAMBER LED TO THE MAJORITY BEING REVERSED AND THE MEASURE WAS PASSED ANOTHER MEASURE REVISED THE MACKAY LAW AND CONFERRED A LARGER SUBSIDY ON PRIVATE SCHOOLS
I AM MERELY A FOOLISH WOMAN WITH A YOUNG GIRL'S FANCIES AND YET IT IS SO REAL WITH ME SO ENTIRELY PART OF MY VERY SELF THAT I CANNOT HELP ACTING UPON IT IF I MARRY I DO WANT TO MARRY A FAMOUS MAN
DOCTOR KUYPER RESIGNED AND A NEW MINISTRY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE MODERATE LIBERAL DE MEESTER TOOK ITS PLACE THE DE MEESTER GOVERNMENT WAS HOWEVER DEPENDENT UPON THE SOCIALIST VOTE
NOW TELL ME WHAT'S AMISS WITH ME I'M IN LOVE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE SAID SHE IT WAS MY TURN TO JUMP OUT OF MY CHAIR
AS TO YOUR SUGGESTION THAT I MAY MODIFY MY OPINION I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT IT IS NOT MY HABIT TO DO SO AFTER A DELIBERATE EXPRESSION OF MY MATURE VIEWS YOU WILL KINDLY SHOW THE ENVELOPE OF THIS LETTER TO MY MAN AUSTIN WHEN YOU CALL
AND LED TO SANGUINARY REPRISALS ON THE PART OF THE DUTCH SOLDIERY
I ASKED IN GENUINE WONDER DON'T WOMEN ALWAYS KNOW DO YOU SUPPOSE ANY WOMAN IN THE WORLD WAS EVER TAKEN UNAWARES BUT OH NED OUR FRIENDSHIP HAS BEEN SO GOOD AND SO PLEASANT
I WOULD NEED THE OIL CAN BADLY IT WAS A BIT OF GOOD LUCK TO HAVE THEIR NEW COMRADE JOIN THE PARTY FOR SOON AFTER THEY HAD BEGUN THEIR JOURNEY AGAIN THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THE TREES AND BRANCHES GREW SO THICK OVER THE ROAD
HOW DID YOU HAPPEN TO BE HERE WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO THE EMERALD CITY TO SEE THE GREAT OZ SHE ANSWERED AND WE STOPPED AT YOUR COTTAGE TO PASS THE NIGHT WHY DO YOU WISH TO SEE OZ HE ASKED I WANT HIM TO SEND ME BACK TO KANSAS
COME ALONG TOTO SHE SAID WE WILL GO TO THE EMERALD CITY AND ASK THE GREAT OZ HOW TO GET BACK TO KANSAS AGAIN SHE CLOSED THE DOOR LOCKED IT AND PUT THE KEY CAREFULLY IN THE POCKET OF HER DRESS AND SO
SHE WAS SURPRISED AS SHE WALKED ALONG TO SEE HOW PRETTY THE COUNTRY WAS ABOUT HER THERE WERE NEAT FENCES AT THE SIDES OF THE ROAD PAINTED A DAINTY BLUE COLOR AND BEYOND THEM WERE FIELDS OF GRAIN AND VEGETABLES IN ABUNDANCE
SO SHE BRAVELY RESOLVED NOT TO TURN BACK SHE BADE HER FRIENDS GOOD BYE AND AGAIN STARTED ALONG THE ROAD OF YELLOW BRICK WHEN SHE HAD GONE SEVERAL MILES SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD STOP TO REST
MY NAME IS DOROTHY SAID THE GIRL AND I AM GOING TO THE EMERALD CITY TO ASK THE GREAT OZ TO SEND ME BACK TO KANSAS WHERE IS THE EMERALD CITY HE INQUIRED AND WHO IS OZ WHY
THERE IS A GREAT DESERT AND NONE COULD LIVE TO CROSS IT IT IS THE SAME AT THE SOUTH SAID ANOTHER FOR I HAVE BEEN THERE AND SEEN IT THE SOUTH IS THE COUNTRY OF THE QUADLINGS I AM TOLD SAID THE THIRD MAN
WHILE SHE STOOD LOOKING EAGERLY AT THE STRANGE AND BEAUTIFUL SIGHTS SHE NOTICED COMING TOWARD HER A GROUP OF THE QUEEREST PEOPLE SHE HAD EVER SEEN THEY WERE NOT AS BIG AS THE GROWN FOLK SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN USED TO BUT NEITHER WERE THEY VERY SMALL IN FACT
THREE IN A SOLEMN VOICE AT ONCE THE CAP CHANGED TO A SLATE ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN BIG WHITE CHALK MARKS LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN TOOK THE SLATE FROM HER NOSE
DOROTHY ATE A HEARTY SUPPER AND WAS WAITED UPON BY THE RICH MUNCHKIN HIMSELF WHOSE NAME WAS BOQ THEN SHE SAT UPON A SETTEE AND WATCHED THE PEOPLE DANCE WHEN BOQ SAW HER SILVER SHOES HE SAID
THIS AT FIRST SEEMED A GREAT MISFORTUNE FOR I KNEW A ONE LEGGED MAN COULD NOT DO VERY WELL AS A WOOD CHOPPER SO I WENT TO A TINSMITH AND HAD HIM MAKE ME A NEW LEG OUT OF TIN THE LEG WORKED VERY WELL ONCE I WAS USED TO IT
ANSWERED THE WITCH SINKING HER VOICE TO A WHISPER HE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN ALL THE REST OF US TOGETHER HE LIVES IN THE CITY OF EMERALDS DOROTHY WAS GOING TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION BUT JUST THEN
FIVE LITTLE FIDDLERS PLAYED AS LOUDLY AS POSSIBLE AND THE PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AND SINGING WHILE A BIG TABLE NEAR BY WAS LOADED WITH DELICIOUS FRUITS AND NUTS PIES AND CAKES
AND WE HAVE AMEINOCLES A CORINTHIAN SHIPWRIGHT MAKING FOUR SHIPS FOR THE SAMIANS DATING FROM THE END OF THIS WAR IT IS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO
BUT IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE AS WE HAVE JUST SHOWN YOUR HABITS ARE OLD FASHIONED AS COMPARED WITH THEIRS IT IS THE LAW AS IN ART SO IN POLITICS THAT IMPROVEMENTS EVER PREVAIL
AND HAD COME AND WERE OPENLY FIGHTING AGAINST HER ON THE SIDE OF THE POTIDAEANS FOR ALL THIS WAR HAD NOT YET BROKEN OUT THERE WAS STILL TRUCE FOR A WHILE FOR THIS WAS A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE ON THE PART OF CORINTH
AND TO REFRESH THE MEMORY OF THE OLD AND ENLIGHTEN THE IGNORANCE OF THE YOUNG FROM A NOTION THAT THEIR WORDS MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF INDUCING THEM TO PREFER TRANQUILLITY TO WAR
AND THE MARKET OF ATHENS IN DEFIANCE OF THE TREATY LAST OF ALL THE CORINTHIANS CAME FORWARD AND HAVING LET THOSE WHO PRECEDED THEM INFLAME THE LACEDAEMONIANS NOW FOLLOWED WITH A SPEECH TO THIS EFFECT
THE GREAT CONTRAST BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONAL CHARACTERS A CONTRAST OF WHICH AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE YOU HAVE LITTLE PERCEPTION HAVING NEVER YET CONSIDERED WHAT SORT OF ANTAGONISTS YOU WILL ENCOUNTER IN THE ATHENIANS HOW WIDELY
THEY SEEM TO HAVE TURNED TO CULTIVATION OF THE CHERSONESE AND TO PIRACY FROM WANT OF SUPPLIES THIS WAS WHAT REALLY ENABLED THE TROJANS TO KEEP THE FIELD FOR TEN YEARS AGAINST THEM THE DISPERSION OF THE ENEMY MAKING THEM ALWAYS A MATCH FOR THE DETACHMENT LEFT BEHIND
AND ENJOYED A FREEDOM FROM TYRANTS WHICH WAS UNBROKEN IT HAS POSSESSED THE SAME FORM OF GOVERNMENT FOR MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS RECKONING TO THE END OF THE LATE WAR AND HAS THUS BEEN IN A POSITION TO ARRANGE THE AFFAIRS OF THE OTHER STATES
HAVING NOW GIVEN THE RESULT OF MY INQUIRIES INTO EARLY TIMES I GRANT THAT THERE WILL BE A DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING EVERY PARTICULAR DETAIL THE WAY THAT MOST MEN DEAL WITH TRADITIONS EVEN TRADITIONS OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY
NOW AGAMEMNON'S WAS A CONTINENTAL POWER AND HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OF ANY EXCEPT THE ADJACENT ISLANDS AND THESE WOULD NOT BE MANY BUT THROUGH THE POSSESSION OF A FLEET
HERE BY THE PARTIES CONTENDING THE OLD INHABITANTS BEING SOMETIMES REMOVED TO MAKE ROOM FOR OTHERS NEVER WAS THERE SO MUCH BANISHING AND BLOOD SHEDDING NOW ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE NOW IN THE STRIFE OF FACTION
FOR THEY HOPE BY THEIR ABSENCE TO EXTEND THEIR ACQUISITIONS YOU FEAR BY YOUR ADVANCE TO ENDANGER WHAT YOU HAVE LEFT BEHIND THEY ARE SWIFT TO FOLLOW UP A SUCCESS AND SLOW TO RECOIL FROM A REVERSE THEIR BODIES THEY SPEND UNGRUDGINGLY IN THEIR COUNTRY'S CAUSE
SO THAT MUCH HAD TO BE DONE AND MANY YEARS HAD TO ELAPSE BEFORE HELLAS COULD ATTAIN TO A DURABLE TRANQUILLITY UNDISTURBED BY REMOVALS AND COULD BEGIN TO SEND OUT COLONIES AS ATHENS DID TO IONIA AND MOST OF THE ISLANDS
HOW ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT FROM YOURSELVES THE ATHENIANS ARE ADDICTED TO INNOVATION AND THEIR DESIGNS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY SWIFTNESS ALIKE IN CONCEPTION AND EXECUTION YOU HAVE A GENIUS FOR KEEPING WHAT YOU HAVE GOT ACCOMPANIED BY A TOTAL WANT OF INVENTION
AND EVER THE TRAMP OF HIS ARMIES SOUNDED NEARER AND NEARER IN THE LISTENING EARS OF THE GODS THEN THE GODS CALLED TO THEIR DOWNLANDS TO SAVE THEIR WORLD FROM SLID AND THE DOWNLANDS GATHERED THEMSELVES AND MARCHED AWAY A GREAT WHITE LINE OF GLEAMING CLIFFS
I THANK YOU DARNAY I MAY USE THAT FREEDOM WITH YOUR NAME I THINK SO CARTON BY THIS TIME THEY SHOOK HANDS UPON IT AND SYDNEY TURNED AWAY
AND INZANA SAT AND LISTENED AND THOUGHT OF NO GOLDEN BALL NOR EVER OF CHALCEDONY AND ONYX NOR OF ALL HER FATHERS THE GODS BUT ONLY OF ALL THE BIRDS THEN IN THE WOODS AND MEADOWS WHERE THEY HAD ALL SUDDENLY SUNG THEY SUDDENLY CEASED
ALL IN A WORLD OF ROCKS UNDER THE RIM OF THE SKY AND SHE WANTED HER GOLDEN BALL AND COULD NOT LOVE THE DARK THEREAT UMBORODOM WHOSE HOUND WAS THE THUNDER TOOK HIS HOUND IN LEASH AND STRODE AWAY ACROSS THE SKY AFTER THE GOLDEN BALL
BUT SLID ADVANCED AND LED HIS ARMIES UP THE VALLEY AND INCH BY INCH AND MILE BY MILE HE CONQUERED THE LANDS OF THE GODS THEN FROM THEIR HILLS THE GODS SENT DOWN A GREAT ARRAY OF CLIFFS AGAINST HARD RED ROCKS
AND THERE WERE ONLY THE EYES OF THE GODS IN THE DARKNESS PEERING FOR THE GOLDEN BALL THEN SAID THE GODS THOU HAST LOST THY GOLDEN BALL AND THEY MADE HER A MOON OF SILVER TO ROLL ABOUT THE SKY
THEN ON AN ONYX STEP INZANA SAT DOWN AND WEPT WHO COULD NO MORE BE HAPPY WITHOUT HER GOLDEN BALL AND AGAIN THE GODS WERE SORRY AND THE SOUTH WIND CAME TO TELL HER TALES OF MOST ENCHANTED ISLANDS TO WHOM SHE LISTENED NOT
DON'T BE ALARMED I AM NOT GOING TO PREACH I AM NOT AT ALL ALARMED EARNESTNESS IN YOU IS ANYTHING BUT ALARMING TO ME AH SAID CARTON WITH A CARELESS WAVE OF HIS HAND AS IF HE WAVED THAT AWAY ON THE DRUNKEN OCCASION IN QUESTION
AND WHEN THE WAVES WERE SCATTERED LIKE THOSE BEFORE THEM THE FEET OF THE CLIFFS WERE NO LONGER STANDING FIRM AND THEIR FACES WERE SCARRED AND BATTERED THEN INTO EVERY CLEFT THAT STOOD IN THE ROCKS SLID SENT HIS HUGEST WAVE AND OTHERS FOLLOWED BEHIND IT
UPON MY LIFE SAID CARTON SMILING I FIND THAT EASIER TO COMPREHEND IN MY OWN MIND THAN TO CONVEY TO YOURS HOWEVER LET ME TRY YOU REMEMBER A CERTAIN FAMOUS OCCASION WHEN I WAS MORE DRUNK THAN THAN USUAL
AND FELL TOWARDS THE FIELDS AND AS INZANA STOOPED TO PICK IT UP SHE SUDDENLY HEARD THE SINGING OF ALL THE BIRDS THAT WERE
CHARLES DARNAY MADE SOME MENTION OF THIS CONVERSATION IN GENERAL TERMS AND SPOKE OF SYDNEY CARTON AS A PROBLEM OF CARELESSNESS AND RECKLESSNESS HE SPOKE OF HIM IN SHORT NOT BITTERLY OR MEANING TO BEAR HARD UPON HIM BUT AS ANYBODY MIGHT WHO SAW HIM AS HE SHOWED HIMSELF
AND UP THE VALLEYS SHALL GO UMBORODOM
SO HE MOVED HERE WHERE THE RENT IS HIGHER THE LAND POORER AND THE OWNER INFLEXIBLE HE RENTS A FORTY DOLLAR MULE FOR TWENTY DOLLARS A YEAR POOR LAD A SLAVE AT TWENTY TWO THIS PLANTATION OWNED NOW BY A FOREIGNER
BITTERLY HE UNBOWED PRIDE OF A HUNTED RACE CLINGING WITH THAT TINY DIMPLED HAND AH WEARILY TO A HOPE NOT HOPELESS BUT UNHOPEFUL
SOME MORNING THIS MAY BE LONG LONG YEARS TO COME BUT NOW THERE WAILS ON THAT DARK SHORE WITHIN THE VEIL THE SAME DEEP VOICE THOU SHALT FOREGO
I SHIRK NOT I LONG FOR WORK I PANT FOR A LIFE FULL OF STRIVING I AM NO COWARD TO SHRINK BEFORE THE RUGGED RUSH OF THE STORM NOR EVEN QUAIL BEFORE THE AWFUL SHADOW OF THE VEIL BUT HEARKEN O DEATH
THE RETURNS OF THE FARMER ARE TOO SMALL TO ALLOW MUCH FOR WAGES AND YET HE WILL NOT SELL OFF SMALL FARMS THERE IS THE NEGRO SANFORD HE HAS WORKED FOURTEEN YEARS AS OVERSEER ON THE LADSON PLACE AND
FLED FAST AND FASTER THAN BOAT AND STEAM CAR AND YET MUST EVER IMPATIENTLY AWAIT THEM AWAY FROM THE HARD VOICED CITY
SANG THE BIT OF YELLOW PAPER THAT FLUTTERED INTO MY ROOM ONE BROWN OCTOBER MORNING THEN THE FEAR OF FATHERHOOD MINGLED WILDLY WITH THE JOY OF CREATION I WONDERED HOW IT LOOKED
THE SOLEMN PINES HAVE DISAPPEARED AND THIS IS THE OAKEY WOODS WITH ITS WEALTH OF HICKORIES BEECHES OAKS AND PALMETTOS BUT A PALL OF DEBT HANGS OVER THE BEAUTIFUL LAND THE MERCHANTS ARE IN DEBT TO THE WHOLESALERS
THEY DID NOT SAY MUCH THOSE PALE FACED HURRYING MEN AND WOMEN THEY DID NOT SAY MUCH THEY ONLY GLANCED AND SAID NIGGERS
AND FEW HAVE TIME TO TALK TIRED WITH THE LONG RIDE WE GLADLY DRIVE INTO GILLONSVILLE IT IS A SILENT CLUSTER OF FARMHOUSES STANDING ON THE CROSSROADS WITH ONE OF ITS STORES CLOSED AND THE OTHER KEPT BY A NEGRO PREACHER
WELCOME QUITE A CONTRAST TO THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF DOUGHERTY COUNTY IS THE NORTHWEST SOBERLY TIMBERED IN OAK AND PINE IT HAS NONE OF THAT HALF TROPICAL LUXURIANCE OF THE SOUTHWEST
THE OVERSEERS ARE WHITE AND THE CABINS ARE BARE BOARD HOUSES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE THE RENTS ARE HIGH AND DAY LABORERS AND CONTRACT HANDS ABOUND IT IS A KEEN HARD STRUGGLE FOR LIVING HERE
PRAISE TO THE FACE IS OPEN DISGRACE I HEARD NO MORE DREADING SOME SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SINCERE EXPRESSION ON THE SUBJECT OF FEMALE LOVELINESS I WALKED AWAY
TINKLED RESPONSIVE TO A DIFFIDENT AND UNCERTAIN TOUCH ON THE WHITE WALL THE SHADOW OF AN OLD AND SHARP PROFILE WAS BENDING OVER SEVERAL SYMMETRICAL AND SHADOWY CURLS I SEZ TO MARIAR MARIAR SEZ I
CHECKING THE COMPLIMENT THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE RISEN UNBIDDEN TO MY LIPS AND HAVE BROUGHT SHAME AND SORROW TO THE HOUSEHOLD IT WAS WITH THE MEMORY OF THESE EXPERIENCES RESTING HEAVILY UPON ME THAT I STOOD HESITATINGLY BEFORE THE STAGE DOOR
WHEN I GET HOLD OF ONE IN CHICAGO YET I SHOULDN'T EVEN TRY TO HOLD YOUR HAND I'M BROKEN IT'S THE HISTORICAL ANGLO SAXON WAY OF MAKING LIFE MISERABLE
THEY WERE NOT AT HOME LIKE A CHILD WHO HAS NO ONE TO PLAY WITH SHE LOITERED THROUGH THE DARK HALL SHE SAW A LIGHT UNDER AN OFFICE DOOR SHE KNOCKED TO THE PERSON WHO OPENED SHE MURMURED DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW WHERE THE PERRYS ARE
I WON'T BELIEVE THAT MEDICINE THE PRIESTHOOD OF HEALING CAN BE TURNED INTO A PENNY PICKING BUSINESS SEE HERE HASN'T KENNICOTT EVER HINTED TO YOU THAT YOU'D BETTER BE NICE TO SOME OLD WOMAN BECAUSE SHE TELLS HER FRIENDS WHICH DOCTOR TO CALL IN BUT I OUGHTN'T TO
ALONG WITH GENERAL GRANT'S SWORD AND I'M OH I SUPPOSE I'M SEEKING FOR A GOSPEL THAT WILL EVANGELIZE GOPHER PRAIRIE REALLY EVANGELIZE IT TO WHAT TO ANYTHING THAT'S DEFINITE SERIOUSNESS OR FRIVOLOUSNESS OR BOTH
HE STALKED TO HER TOOK HER UNRESPONSIVE HAND CAROL YOU HAVE BEEN HAPPY HERE TONIGHT YES I'M BEGGING SHE SQUEEZED HIS HAND QUICKLY THEN SNATCHED HERS AWAY SHE HAD BUT LITTLE OF THE CURIOSITY OF THE FLIRT
I PICKED IT UP WITH AN INTEREST THAT HOWEVER SOON ABATED THERE WAS NO SCENT OF THE ROSES TO CLING TO IT STILL NOT EVEN OF HAIR OIL NO BEND OR TWIST IN ITS RIGID ANGLES BETRAYED ANY TRAIT OF ITS WEARER'S CHARACTER
I THOUGHT I WAS KEEPING UP BUT I GUESS THE VILLAGE VIRUS HAD ME ALREADY I WAS READING FOUR COPIES OF CHEAP FICTION MAGAZINES TO ONE POEM I'D PUT OFF THE MINNEAPOLIS TRIPS TILL I SIMPLY HAD TO GO THERE ON A LOT OF LEGAL MATTERS
THE DILLONS YES REALLY QUITE A DECENT YOUNG PAIR HARVEY DILLON AND HIS WIFE HE'S A DENTIST JUST COME TO TOWN THEY LIVE IN A ROOM BEHIND HIS OFFICE SAME AS I DO HERE THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH OF ANYBODY I'VE HEARD OF THEM
I WOULDN'T CARE WHETHER IT WAS A LABORATORY OR A CARNIVAL BUT IT'S MERELY SAFE TELL ME MISTER POLLOCK WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH GOPHER PRAIRIE IS ANYTHING THE MATTER WITH IT ISN'T THERE PERHAPS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH YOU AND ME
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SMALL QUANTITY OF MULE FLESH WHICH MANY OF THE PRISONERS COULD NOT EAT THEY GOT NOTHING WHATEVER AND SLOWLY STARVED WHEN L'OLONNOIS AND HIS FRIENDS HAD BEEN IN POSSESSION OF GIBRALTAR FOR ABOUT A MONTH
HE DID SO WITH THE IDEA OF FOUNDING THERE A PERMANENT PIRATE PRINCIPALITY THE INHABITANTS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ENGLISH FRENCH OR DUTCH BUT PLAIN PIRATES HAVING A NATIONALITY AND COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN
MORGAN ESTIMATED THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE BOOTY TO BE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WHEN THIS COMPARATIVELY SMALL SUM WAS DIVIDED MANY OF THE MEN COMPLAINED THAT IT WOULD NOT GIVE THEM ENOUGH TO PAY THEIR DEBTS IN JAMAICA THEY WERE UTTERLY ASTONISHED
I WENT TO TAFFY'S HOUSE TAFFY WASN'T HOME TAFFY WENT TO MY HOUSE AND STOLE A MARROW BONE WHAT HAPPENED TO TAFFY WE DO NOT KNOW BUT MORGAN WAS A WELSHMAN MORGAN WAS A THIEF AND ONE OF HIS MEN HAD STOLEN A MARROW BONE THEREFORE CAME TROUBLE
THE PIRATES SAILED TO TORTUGA WHERE THEY PROCEEDED WITHOUT LOSS OF TIME TO GET RID OF THE WEALTH THEY HAD AMASSED THEY ATE THEY DRANK THEY GAMBLED THEY CROWDED THE TAVERNS AS TAVERNS HAVE NEVER BEEN CROWDED BEFORE
THESE LATTER WERE APPORTIONED AMONG THE MEN IN THE MOST RIDICULOUS MANNER THE PIRATES HAVING NO IDEA OF THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE JEWELS SOME OF THEM PREFERRING LARGE AND WORTHLESS COLORED STONES TO SMALLER DIAMONDS AND RUBIES WHEN ALL THEIR WICKEDLY GAINED PROPERTY HAD BEEN DIVIDED
AND THE GOVERNOR OF THE TOWN NO DOUBT THOUGHT THAT WHEN HIS WELL ARMED HORSEMEN CHARGED UPON THESE MEN ACCUSTOMED TO FIGHTING ON THE DECKS OF SHIPS AND TOTALLY UNUSED TO CAVALRY COMBATS HE WOULD SOON SCATTER AND DISPERSE THEM BUT PIRATES ARE PECULIAR FIGHTERS
THAT UNLESS IN THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS A RANSOM OF TEN THOUSAND PIECES OF EIGHT WERE PAID TO THEM THEY WOULD BURN THE TOWN TO THE GROUND NO MATTER WHAT THEY THOUGHT OF THIS HEARTLESS DEMAND IT WAS NOT EASY FOR THE SCATTERED CITIZENS TO COLLECT SUCH A SUM AS THIS
THEIR GREAT OBJECT WAS TO TAKE EVERYTHING THEY COULD FIND AND THEN TRY TO MAKE THE PEOPLE CONFESS WHERE OTHER THINGS WERE HIDDEN MEN AND WOMEN WERE HACKED TO PIECES WITH SWORDS
AND REACHED THE MOUTH OF THE NICARAGUA RIVER THERE HIS PARTY WAS ATTACKED BY SOME SPANIARDS AND INDIANS WHO KILLED MORE THAN HALF OF THEM AND PREVENTED THE OTHERS FROM LANDING
THE SPANISH GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE HAD HEARD OF THEIR APPROACH AND MET THEM WITH A BODY OF SOLDIERS SO LARGE THAT THEY PRUDENTLY GAVE UP THE ATTEMPT A PROCEEDING NOT VERY COMMON WITH THEM BUT MORGAN WAS NOT ONLY A DARE DEVIL OF A PIRATE
WHEN THIS HAD BEEN DONE THEY FELT SAFE AND BEGAN TO ACT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN A MENAGERIE OF WILD BEASTS LET LOOSE UPON A BODY OF DEFENCELESS MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN NOT ONLY DID THESE WRETCHED MEN RUSH INTO THE HOUSES STEALING EVERYTHING VALUABLE THEY COULD FIND AND WERE ABLE TO CARRY AWAY
IT WAS NECESSARY TO START OUT AGAIN AND COMMIT SOME MORE ACTS OF ROBBERY AND RUIN AND L'OLONNOIS WHOSE RAPACIOUS MIND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH A DESIRE FOR TOWN DESTROYING PROJECTED AN EXPEDITION TO NICARAGUA
