AS I SUPPOSE BILL HARMON TOLD YOU WHEN HE SENT YOU MOTHER'S CHECK FOR FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER WE THINK IT IS VERY REASONABLE AND DO NOT WONDER YOU DON'T LIKE TO SPEND ANYTHING ON REPAIRS OR IMPROVEMENTS FOR US AS YOU HAVE TO PAY TAXES AND INSURANCE
AND METHOUGHT MY SERVANTS HAD SOUGHT TO PLEASURE ME BY ADMITTING A MAN OF SUCH GOOD BREEDING AND FINE CULTURE THEN I ASKED HIM ART THOU FOR MEAT AND HE ANSWERED I HAVE NO NEED OF IT AND FOR DRINK QUOTH I AND QUOTH HE THAT IS AS THOU WILT

ONCE CONVINCE MISTER GALLOWAY THAT HE WAS NOT THE GUILTY PARTY AND THAT GENTLEMAN WOULD FORTHWITH ISSUE FRESH INSTRUCTIONS TO BUTTERBY FOR THE FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE AFFAIR OF THIS ARTHUR FELT CONVINCED HE COULD ONLY BE SILENT AND REMAIN UNDER THE STIGMA THEN
HAVE THOUGHT AND TAUGHT THAT THE PRESENCE OF A MENSTRUATING WOMAN WOULD POLLUTE SOLEMN RELIGIOUS RITES WOULD SOUR MILK SPOIL THE FERMENTATION IN WINE VATS AND MUCH OTHER MISCHIEF IN A GENERAL WAY INFLUENCED BY HOARY TRADITION
AND CLIMBING OVER THE WALLS MADE HIS ESCAPE WHEN MORGIANA SAW HIM DEPART SHE WENT TO BED SATISFIED AND PLEASED TO HAVE SUCCEEDED SO WELL IN SAVING HER MASTER AND FAMILY ALI BABA ROSE BEFORE DAY AND FOLLOWED BY HIS SLAVE
HE WENT AROUND AND CALLED ON ALL HIS FORMER ACQUAINTANCES WHO WERE STILL LIVING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HIS MEMORIES WERE SO VIVID AND HIS EMOTIONS SO KEEN THAT HE WROTE A LONG POEM ABOUT THIS
WHY DID HE REFRAIN FROM GIVING A NARRATION OF THAT GARDEN SCENE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN WITNESS WAS IT THAT HE FEARED HUMILIATION BY DISCLOSING THE PART HE HAD HIMSELF PLAYED WHATEVER WAS THE REASON THE TRUTH WAS SHUNNED
FORTUNATELY I DID NOT GO SO FAR I HAVE DONE ENOUGH TO DESERVE BEING CALLED WORSE THAN FOOL THOUGH PERHAPS UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I MAY OBTAIN FORGIVENESS FOR MY FAULT AT ALL EVENTS I INTEND TO TRY FOR IT
AND SINCE THAT HE HAS SENT ME A NOTE TO THE SAME EFFECT ONLY GOING MORE INTO DETAIL IT IS MOST PLEASANT TOO TO MY FEELINGS TO HAVE SUCH A TESTIMONY TO THE SUBSTANTIAL TRUTH AND IMPORTANCE
WHO IS IN A MANNER THE CAPTAIN OF THEM IS IN A FRENZY AND WOULD FAIN DISCOVER WHOM HE CAN DEFRAUD OR DESPOIL OF HIS PROPERTY IN ORDER THAT HE MAY GRATIFY THEM YES THAT IS SURE TO BE THE CASE HE MUST HAVE MONEY
ON THIS OCCASION HOWEVER SHE ADMIRED THE SIZE OF THE RUBIES AND THE BRILLIANCY OF THE DIAMONDS SHE GRIEVED OVER EVERY BLEMISH AND EVERY DEFECT SHE THOUGHT THE GOLD LIGHT AND THE STONES WRETCHED THE GOLDSMITH AS HE ENTERED FOUND HER THUS OCCUPIED
SEA BORN MESSAPUS WITH ATINAS HEADS THE LATIN SQUADRONS AND TO BATTLE LEADS THEY STRIKE THEY PUSH THEY THRONG THE SCANTY SPACE RESOLV'D ON DEATH IMPATIENT OF DISGRACE AND WHERE ONE FALLS ANOTHER FILLS HIS PLACE
GLANCE AFTER GLANCE HE CAST ON THE FLASK OF WATER WHICH HUNG AT HIS BELT THREE DROPS ARE ENOUGH AT LAST THOUGHT HE I MAY AT LEAST COOL MY LIPS WITH IT HE OPENED THE FLASK AND WAS RAISING IT TO HIS LIPS
NOT TILL ON THE POINT OF LEAVING DID SHE REMEMBER THE PAINTING IT LAY UNHARMED WHERE IT HAD FALLEN WHEN VICTOR SEIZED HER VEIL SHE WAS CALM ENOUGH NOW TO CONSIDER HERSELF FORTUNATE IN FINDING IT SO POORLY SECURED IN ITS FRAME
BUT I DID NOT FEEL MYSELF ALTOGETHER AT LIBERTY TO ENGAGE IN A TASK OF THIS CHARACTER WITH NO MORE RELIABLE WITNESSES THAN THESE PEOPLE IN CASE OF SUDDEN ACCIDENT MIGHT PROVE I THEREFORE POSTPONED OPERATIONS UNTIL ABOUT EIGHT THE NEXT NIGHT
HE KNEW THAT THEY JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SMART MISTER CHATTERER HAD REALLY BEEN CAUGHT AND NO ONE DID BELIEVE IT ALL RIGHT SAMMY WOULD REPLY IT DOESN'T MAKE THE LEAST BIT OF DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD TO ME

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVEY IN WORDS ANY REAL IDEA OF THE SCENE AND HOW THINGS HAPPENED OF COURSE IT WAS ONLY FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND THAT WE LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES
WITHOUT A FRIEND TO PROTECT A RELATION TO COUNSEL HER I DON'T COUNT AUNT SUSAN WHO LURKED IN LADYLIKE INDIGENCE AT BLACKHEATH AND WHOSE COUNSEL LIKE HER TRACTS WAS GIVEN AWAY TOO PROFUSELY TO EVERYBODY
EVERY ONE WHO RECEIVES THE PROTECTION OF SOCIETY OWES A RETURN FOR THE BENEFIT AND THE FACT OF LIVING IN SOCIETY RENDERS IT INDISPENSABLE THAT EACH SHOULD BE BOUND TO OBSERVE A CERTAIN LINE OF CONDUCT TOWARDS THE REST THIS CONDUCT CONSISTS FIRST

READY TO THROW THE SLING OVER HIS HEAD IF THE NEED SPRANG UP FOR ITS USE BUT THERE WAS EVIDENTLY NO IMMEDIATE DANGER FOR QUITE AN HOUR PASSED BEFORE THERE WAS ANOTHER SHOT FIRED TO RAISE THE ECHOES AND THIS PROVED TO BE SINGLE
THAT THE NAME OF FERRARS BEGAN WITH AN F AND THIS PREPARED A FUTURE MINE OF RAILLERY AGAINST THE DEVOTED ELINOR WHICH NOTHING BUT THE NEWNESS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH EDWARD COULD HAVE PREVENTED FROM BEING IMMEDIATELY SPRUNG
SANDFORD NOW READ THE LETTER TO HER AND REPEATED AS NEARLY AS HE COULD REMEMBER THE WHOLE OF THE CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN LORD ELMWOOD AND HIMSELF NOT EVEN SPARING THROUGH AN ERRONEOUS DELICACY ANY OF THOSE THREATS HER FATHER HAD DENOUNCED
THE ANSWER SEEMS TO US TO BE CLEAR RECEIVING INTO THEIR RANKS ALL THOSE WHOM CRIME THE FEAR OF PUNISHMENT AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE OR THE CHARM OF A ROAMING LIFE CONTINUALLY THREW IN THEIR PATH
I NEVER KNEW HER SO NAUGHTY AND IT SEEMED VERY NEGLECTFUL NOT TO COME TO SEE AFTER YOU POOR DEAR CHILD BUT REALLY I COULDN'T RAISE MY HEAD NEITHER COULD I AND I FELT JUST AS GUILTY NOT TO BE TAKING CARE OF YOU SAID KATY WELL
TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE FRESHLY FILLED BASKET BUT TO HER SURPRISE SHE COULD NOT FIND IT ANYWHERE UP AND DOWN THE GARDEN SHE SEARCHED SPYING INTO EVERY CORNER BUT NOT A SIGN OF IT WAS TO BE FOUND

TO THAT BEST AND DEAREST OF WOMEN WHOM I AFTERWARDS MARRIED I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO RECOLLECT THEM AS WELL AS I CAN AT LEAST ALL THOSE INCIDENTS WHICH ARE MOST WORTH RELATING TO YOU IF THE VULGAR OPINION OF THE FATALITY IN MARRIAGE HAD EVER ANY FOUNDATION
HE WAS SHREWD AND POSSESSED A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD HE WAS A GENTLEMAN AND A MAN OF INTELLIGENCE EXTREMELY AGREEABLE AND WITTY HIS HABITS WERE GOOD HE WAS CHARITABLE HE NEVER CHEATED ANYBODY
THE WOMAN AT THE LAKE AND IN THE COURTYARD THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND THE VANISHING OF THE EVIDENCE UNDER HIS HAND PAREDES'S ODD BEHAVIOUR ALL BECAME IN HIS MIND PUZZLING DETAILS THAT FAILED TO OBSCURE THE CHIEF FACT
AND HE MADE UP HIS MIND NOW THAT THE OLD MAN HAD A SECRET HOARD SOMEWHERE WHICH MIGHT BE HIS IF HE COULD FIND IT HE SOON LEARNED THAT IF KIT KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT HE WOULD NOT TELL SO HE AND HIS LAWYER A SLEEK OILY RASCAL NAMED BRASS
WHICH I DID VERY WILLINGLY BELIEVING AS IT APPEARED THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY IT NOR DID THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE FAIL TO FIND HER ACCOUNT IN IT TOO WE HAD LIVED THUS NEAR THREE MONTHS WHEN

BEAUREGARD AT DAWN WOULD HAVE TO FACE TWICE HIS NUMBERS AT LEAST HALF OF WHOM WERE FRESH TROOPS ANOTHER CONFERENCE WAS HELD BY THE SOUTHERN GENERALS IN THE FOREST BUT NOW THE CENTRAL FIGURE THE GREAT JOHNSTON WAS GONE
