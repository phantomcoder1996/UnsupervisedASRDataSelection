JUST AS LITTLE SUZANNE WAS ABOUT TO MOUNT THE TERRACE STEPS A GROOM CAME RUNNING ROUND THE HOUSE TOWARDS HIS MISTRESS HE CARRIED A SEALED LETTER IN HIS HAND SUZANNE INSTINCTIVELY TURNED BACK HER HEART TOLD HER THAT HERE PERHAPS WAS FURTHER ILL NEWS FOR HER FRIEND

AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT HE SAW MANY WILD DOINGS HE WAS HOWEVER OF STUDIOUS HABITS AND LOVED READING MORE THAN THE AIR HE BREATHED AND WHILE LITTLE IS KNOWN OF HIS BOYHOOD YEARS IT IS CERTAIN THAT HE MASTERED THEN AND IN HIS EARLY MANHOOD
THAT'S WHERE OUR ALUMNI COME IN THEY OFTEN RUN DOWN TO COLLEGE FOR A FEW DAYS AND HELP US OUT WITH MONEY AND INFLUENCE AND EXPERIENCE IF YOU'VE GOT GOOD WORKING ALUMNI YOU'RE RIGHT IN IT YOU SEE WE GENERALLY APPOINT A COMMITTEE TO TALK THINGS OVER WITH THE ALUMNI

BESIDES ALL THIS THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF DISTRACTING CONVERSATION NEAR THE TABLE BETWEEN ANGELO BANTAM AND THE TWO MISSES MATINTER WHO BEING SINGLE AND SINGULAR PAID GREAT COURT TO THE MASTER OF THE CEREMONIES IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A STRAY PARTNER NOW AND THEN
THE SAME TASTE I HAPPENED TO SPEAK OF THAT RIVER TO OUR LAST GUIDE A RATHER SUPERIOR FELLOW WITH QUICK BRIGHT EYES HE TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER RIVER OVER THERE SHORT RIVER SWEET WATER RED AND BLUE
THEY SET OUT TO MAKE IT GOOD BY CONSTRUCTING IN THE YEARS SEVENTEEN FIFTY TWO SEVENTEEN FIFTY FOUR FORT LE BOEUF NEAR LAKE ERIE FORT VENANGO ON THE UPPER WATERS OF THE ALLEGHENY AND FORT DUQUESNE

THE HALL WAS SO CLOSELY SURROUNDED BY FIR WOODS THAT IT WAS INVISIBLE UNLESS YOU WERE NEAR IT MISTER JOSHUA PYE PAINTED AWAY IN THE SOLITUDE AND INDEPENDENCE THAT WERE SO DEAR TO HIS UNSOCIABLE HEART FRIDAY AFTERNOON HE FINISHED HIS JOB AND WENT HOME TO CARMODY
WHY HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF SOME OF THEM WHOEVER STARTED THE FIRE DIDN'T CARE A HOOT WHETHER IT HURT OR NOT I THINK BLUFF GAVE AS HIS OPINION FRANK NOTICED THAT THE HEAD HAD DISAPPEARED FROM ALONGSIDE THE OPEN DOOR
RUGGEDO HAD NO FEAR OF FILES OR OZGA BUT TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE HE HAD ORDERED GOLDEN HANDCUFFS PLACED UPON THEIR WRISTS THESE DID NOT CAUSE THEM ANY GREAT ANNOYANCE BUT PREVENTED THEM FROM MAKING AN ATTACK HAD THEY BEEN INCLINED TO DO SO
THEY HAD GOT SOMETHING TO START FROM THEN THEY DID KNOW WHERE THEY WERE AND THE MAP WAS ONCE MORE CONSULTED AND THE THING SEEMED SIMPLER THAN EVER AND OFF THEY STARTED FOR THE THIRD TIME AND THREE MINUTES LATER THEY WERE BACK IN THE CENTRE AGAIN AFTER THAT THEY SIMPLY COULDN'T GET ANYWHERE ELSE
NOW LET US GO ON BUT I AM RECEIVING NO VISITORS AND DO NOT DESIRE ANY UNTIL I HAVE SO MASTERED MY NEW CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THE HANDICAP CONNECTED WITH THEM SHALL NEITHER BE PAINFUL NOR VERY NOTICEABLE TO OTHER PEOPLE

AND ASSIST IN TAKING THE SHIP AFTER SOME DAYS THE CAPTAIN OF THE SPEAKER CAME ON SHORE AND WAS RECEIVED WITH GREAT CIVILITY BY THE HEADS OF THE PIRATES HAVING AGREED BEFORE TO MAKE SATISFACTION IN A DAY OR TWO AFTER HE WAS INVITED BY THEM TO EAT A BARBACUED SHOAT
WHICH THEY DID UTTERING AS THEY WENT LOUD CRIES OF TERROR BUT HAD THEY LOOKED BACK THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE GONE SO FAST NOR SO FAR FOR WHEN THE GIGABOO HEARD THEIR CRIES IT IN TURN BECAME FRIGHTENED HAVING BEEN ACCUSTOMED ALL ITS LIFE TO SILENCE
WHILE THE SUN GOD WHOSE SEMITIC NAME WAS SHAMASH PRESIDED AT LARSA AND SIPPAR OTHER DEITIES WERE SIMILARLY EXALTED IN OTHER STATES AS HAS BEEN INDICATED A MYTHOLOGICAL SYSTEM MUST HAVE BEEN STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY CITY POLITICS
AND OFTEN A GOOD DEAL BETTER THIS TYPE DOES NOT PURPOSE TO BE OUTWITTED BY LIFE HE TRIES ALWAYS TO PUT UP A GOOD SHOWING WHEN HE IS POOR THE THORACIC IS SELDOM POOR HE HAS SO MUCH PERSONALITY
THIS DISMAL REGION SEEMS THE NATURAL HOME OF POVERTY AND DESPAIR THE MAN WHO WAS INTENT ON FOLLOWING THE POOR CREATURE WHO HAD HAD THE COURAGE TO THREAD THESE DARK AND SILENT STREETS SEEMED STRUCK WITH THE SPECTACLE THEY OFFERED
THOUGH I WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE BODY DURING THE REMAINDER OF MY RESIDENCE AT RIVERMOUTH AND AT ONE TIME HELD THE ONEROUS POSITION OF F C FIRST CENTIPEDE EACH OF THE ELECT WORE A COPPER CENT
WITH HIS REMAINING FOOT IN A BASKET IN COLD WEATHER PICKING UP A LIVING ON THIS WISE EVERY MORNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK HE STUMPED TO THE CORNER CARRYING A CHAIR A CLOTHES HORSE A PAIR OF TRESTLES A BOARD A BASKET AND AN UMBRELLA
HE WENT OUT AND FOR AN HOUR OR TWO WANDERED ABOUT THE TOWN HARDLY KNOWING WHITHER HIS STEPS WERE TAKING HIM THERE HAD BEEN A TRAGIC SERIOUSNESS IN WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO HIM THIS EVENING WHICH SEEMED TO COVER HIM WITH CARE
IN WHICH THE YOUNG TROOPER SERVED WHOSE MOTHER WAS NOW TALKING WITH MYSELF IN A SPIRIT OF SUCH HOPEFUL ENTHUSIASM DID I TELL HER THE TRUTH HAD I THE HEART TO BREAK UP HER DREAMS NO
BEING NO LESS THAN THE CAPACITY FOR SAYING NOTHING AND LISTENING POLITELY TO AN INFINITE DEAL OF THE SAME THING IN ANOTHER FORM FROM ME I REMEMBER THAT I TOLD HIM I HAD KNOWN THE PRINCESS MARY FROM A TIME WHEN SHE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD
YOU WON'T FORGET THAT IN A HURRY SHE SAID SMILING GRIMLY TO HERSELF BUT IN A MOMENT THEY WERE BACK AGAIN WITH LARGE POTS OF WATER WHICH THEY POURED ON THE FIRE THEN THEY JOINED HANDS AND DANCED ROUND IT SINGING WICKED TRAITRESS
USEFUL WORKS IN THE FIELD IN MILITARY SERVICE AND IN ARTS EXCEPT THOSE WHICH ARE DEBASING ARE NOT CULTIVATED THE FEW WHO DO PRACTISE THEM DOING SO WITH MUCH AVERSION BUT IN THE CITY OF THE SUN
IF YOU CAN I WILL PAY THE EXPENSE OF THE WHOLE THE PERSON THAT I WANT THE MESSENGER TO SEE IS A WHITE GIRL I EXPECT YOU KNOW WHO I ALLUDE TO IT IS THE GIRL THAT SENT ME AWAY
BUT SHE WAS AN UNCOMPROMISING PURITAN OF PATRIOTISM WITH NO TAINT OF THE SLIGHTEST WORLDLINESS IN HER THOUGHTS I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN LOVE WITH HER BUT IT WAS I WHO HAD TO HEAR OFTENEST HER SCATHING CRITICISM OF MY LEVITIES
QUITE AS MAGNETISM IS NEGLIGIBLE AT A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FROM A MAGNET THEORETICALLY THE ATTRACTION OF A MAGNET SHOULD DECREASE WITH THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BUT THE FALLING OFF IS FOUND TO BE ALMOST ABRUPT AT A SHORT DISTANCE
I KNEW IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS AND YET HE WAS CERTAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANOTHER TIME OF EXCITEMENT AND RUSH AND HEAT THEN I REMEMBERED HIM AS NOW HE HAD BEEN COVERED WITH BLOOD AND DIRT AND PERSPIRATION
AND IF SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AT ALL IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF AT LEAST SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIES
AND IN IT WAS NO HOUSE OF REFUGE NO COMFORTABLE TREE NO WATERS OF HEALING NO NOR ANY OTHER SOUL ALONE SHE WALKED THERE AND THE ONLY FIGURES SHE SAW WERE THOSE OF THE MIRAGE
AND COMPASSED THE AIMS OF THE POWERFUL THE HATRED OF INSTRUCTION FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE PEOPLE WAS A DOGMA WHAT IS THE USE OF HALF LIGHTS SUCH WAS THE COUNTERSIGN NOW THE ERRING CHILD IS THE COROLLARY OF THE IGNORANT CHILD
AND BIDDING A POLITE AND FORMAL ADIEU TO MISS LINTON WITH ONE EQUALLY CEREMONIOUS BUT MORE DISTANT TO MISS WYNN HE SLIPS ROUND TO THE STABLES ORDERS HIS HORSE LEAPS INTO THE SADDLE AND RIDES OFF
BUT I FELT THAT I COULD DO HER NO GOOD COULD NOT HELP HER IF I STAID AS I WAS OFTEN THREATENED BY MY MASTER WITH THE AUCTION BLOCK I FELT I MUST GIVE UP ALL AND ESCAPE FOR MY LIFE
AND ALL AS HE KNEW BECAUSE THERE WAS A FOX WITHIN DOORS AND THEY WOULD KILL IT HE STARTED UP NOW CALLING TO THE GARDENER THAT HE WOULD COME DOWN TO THE DOGS HIMSELF TO QUIET THEM AND BADE THE MAN GO INDOORS AGAIN AND LEAVE IT TO HIM
BEFORE HE BEGAN TO PLAY HE WONDERED WHEREIN LAY THE FASCINATION OF IT NOW HE KNOWS GOLF IS SO POPULAR SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD AT WHICH TO BE BAD CONSIDER WHAT IT IS TO BE BAD AT CRICKET
WELL AND AS FOR YOU SHE CRIED TURNING ON CLARENCE SENDING HER OFF LIKE THAT WITH YOUR SHE WAS FACE TO FACE AGAIN WITH THE TRAGIC NEWS KATIE REMEMBERING IT SIMULTANEOUSLY UTTERED A LOUD SOB
OR DO ANY OTHER DESIRABLE TASK THIS IS A SECOND RELIEF FOR WHICH WE ARE MOST GRATEFUL AT THE LUNCH CAMP THE SNOW COVERING WAS LESS THAN A FOOT AND AT THIS IT IS A BARE NINE INCHES
SO THE FIRST THING WAS TO FIND THE PRINCESS GOLDENHAIR AND TELL HER ABOUT THE NIGHTINGALES FOUNTAIN BUT HOW WAS HE TO FIND HER THE NIGHTINGALES HAD NOT TOLD HIM HE WAS VERY MUCH TROUBLED INDEED HOW WAS HE TO FIND HER
AND YOU RETURN WITH HER FOR HER SAFETY NOW THIS IS A DEAR GENEROUS MANNER OF TREATING ME O HOW I LOVE TO BE GENEROUSLY USED NOW MY DEAR PARENTS I WISH I COULD CONSULT YOU FOR YOUR OPINIONS HOW I SHOULD ACT SHOULD I GO BACK OR SHOULD I NOT
HOWEVER THE SOLITUDE IN WHICH HE STOOD WAS SO STRANGELY CALM THAT THIS FRIGHTFUL UPROAR CLOSE AND FURIOUS AS IT WAS DID NOT DISTURB HIM BY SO MUCH AS THE SHADOW OF A MISGIVING IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THOSE WALLS HAD BEEN BUILT OF THE DEAF STONES OF WHICH THE SCRIPTURES SPEAK
