AND MUSKET SHOTS SOUNDED SEVERAL OF OUR MEN FELL AMONG THEM THE ROUND FACED OFFICER WHO HAD MARCHED SO GAILY AND COMPLACENTLY BUT AT THE MOMENT THE FIRST REPORT WAS HEARD BAGRATION LOOKED ROUND AND SHOUTED
AND ATE IT IN SILENCE THE PLENTY AROUND ME THE EASE AND INDEPENDENCE GAVE ME A DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF COMFORT THE DISHES WERE ODD SOME OF CHINA SOME OF DELF AND WERE CONTINUALLY MOVED OUT OF THEIR PLACES FOR WE HELPED OURSELVES
LIKE THE BEST OF THEM YOU BET I AM GOING TO MAKE THINGS HUM SO I CAN OFFER YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT YOU HAVEN'T OPENED AN OFFICE YET SHE ASKED FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING SOMETHING AND BECAUSE A PRACTICAL THING WOULD NATURALLY SUGGEST ITSELF TO HER
LOOKING OUT FROM THE BIG PIAZZA CROWDED WITH THE HOTEL PEOPLE OUT TO THE ROAD IN FRONT WITH EVERY IMAGINABLE TOURIST PASSING AND REPASSING DONKEYS WERE BEING DRIVEN UP EITHER LOADED DOWN TO THEIR UTMOST WITH HEAVY BAGS AND TRUNKS
MISTER CHAFFANBRASS CERTAINLY DID GET THE BETTER OF HIM BUT THEN MISTER CHAFFANBRASS WAS ON HIS OWN DUNGHILL COULD UNDY SCOTT HAVE HAD MISTER CHAFFANBRASS DOWN AT THE CLUBS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN PERHAPS ANOTHER TALE TO TELL

HIS HUT WAS TEN VERSTS AWAY FROM A RAILROAD STATION IN ONE DIRECTION AND TWELVE VERSTS AWAY IN THE OTHER ABOUT FOUR VERSTS AWAY THERE WAS A COTTON MILL THAT HAD OPENED THE YEAR BEFORE
BUSINESS IS VERY POOR IN THIS SHOP I WAS STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER TURNING QUICKLY ABOUT I LOOKED THROUGH THE NARROW PANES OF THE DOOR AND FOUND THAT MY EYES NATURALLY RESTED ON THE STOOP OF THE OPPOSITE HOUSE
ATTENTIVELY LISTENED TO THE WORDS OF ABUSE THAT THE WOMEN AND THE CONVICTS FLUNG AT EACH OTHER AND REPEATED THEM SOFTLY AS IF LEARNING THEM BY HEART THE TWELFTH PRISONER WHO PAID NO ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING ON
IN HER TURN SHE QUESTIONED JOSEPH AND LEARNED THAT AS SOON AS HE KNEW SHE WAS GOING TO SETTLE AT TESTBRIDGE HE STARTED OFF TO FIND IF POSSIBLE A PLACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HUMBLE ENOUGH TO BE WITHIN HIS REACH
WHAT A JOY THEY WERE I READ GIBBON AND MOSHEIM RIGHT THROUGH AGAIN WITH CARLYLE'S FREDERICK FRENCH REVOLUTION AND CROMWELL FORSTER'S STATESMEN OF THE COMMONWEALTH AND A MASS OF LITERATURE ON THE REBELLION AND THE PROTECTORATE
AND HE SAW AT ONCE THAT HIS WIFE WAS LOOKING AT HIM FROM THE ANIMAL'S EYES YOU MAY WELL THINK IF HE WERE AGHAST AND SO MAYBE WAS HIS LADY AT FINDING HERSELF IN THAT SHAPE SO THEY DID NOTHING FOR NEARLY HALF AN HOUR BUT STARE AT EACH OTHER
HOUSE I WON'T PRESUME TO CALL IT SAID JOSEPH THOUGH IT HAS A LEAN TO FOR THE SMITH AND I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT IT BUT REALLY MISS YOU OUGHTN'T TO BE OUT LIKE THIS AFTER DARK THERE'S TOO MANY VAGABONDS ABOUT

I RECOGNIZED YOU JUST AS I WAS DISAPPEARING OVER THE TOPS OF THE BUSHES SO I CAME RIGHT BACK I LEARNED WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG THAT WHEN STARTLED IT IS BEST TO FLY FIRST AND FIND OUT AFTERWARDS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS REAL DANGER
IT IS OF SUCH A NATURE THAT IT DOES NO HARM TO THE PERSON WHO TAKES IT THE ONLY EFFECT OF IT BEING TO CAUSE A MOST PROFOUND SLEEP THEY ALL ENTREATED HIM TO BRING IT WITHOUT DELAY AND THEN THEY TOOK THEIR LEAVE OF HIM
AND THAT THE HOUSE OF PEERS WOULD HAVE NO PART IN THE HONOR NAY THEY WENT SO FAR AS OPENLY TO TELL THE LORDS THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF THE WHOLE KINGDOM
SAY THAT I MARRY HER I WILL KEEP HER CLOSE AT HOME I WILL TRAIN HER UP TO MY OWN HAND AND SO FASHION HER TO MY WISHES THAT SHE WILL NEVER HAVE A THOUGHT BEYOND THEM I AM NOT SO OLD
WE NEVER THOUGHT OF CATCHING COLD FROM LYING ON THE GROUND OR ON CEDAR BOUGHS OR FROM GETTING A GOOD DRENCHING AFTER ALL THE CABIN COULD NOT BE REACHED AS THE TRAIL COULD NOT BE FOLLOWED AT NIGHT
IT WAS DAYLIGHT WHEN HE REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS THE FIRST DIM IMPRESSION BORNE TO HIS AWAKENING MIND WAS A CONFUSION OF SAVAGE SOUNDS WHICH GRADUALLY RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO THE GROWLING OF LIONS AND THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE
TOOK TO GO TO PHILADELPHIA I FOUND INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN ON REACHING NORTH POINT THEY WENT UP THE BAY IN A NORTH EASTERLY DIRECTION I DEEMED THIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE MY DETERMINATION TO RUN AWAY WAS AGAIN REVIVED
SO FAR AS GRAHAM WAS ABLE TO JUDGE IT WAS NEAR MIDDAY WHEN THE WHITE BANNER OF THE COUNCIL FELL BUT SOME HOURS HAD TO ELAPSE BEFORE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO EFFECT THE FORMAL CAPITULATION AND SO AFTER HE HAD SPOKEN HIS WORD
A HALF FORMED IDEA FLITTED ACROSS LILY'S MIND TEACHING HER TO IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT THAT SHE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE CONCERNED IN THIS ARRANGEMENT BUT THE THOUGHT VANISHED AS QUICKLY AS IT CAME MERELY LEAVING SOME SORENESS BEHIND IT
HER VOICE WENT HIGHER WITH EACH BETTER TILL IT GOT QUITE TO A SQUEAK AT LAST ALICE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO SAY THERE'S A MISTAKE SOMEWHERE WHEN THE QUEEN BEGAN SCREAMING SO LOUD THAT SHE HAD TO LEAVE THE SENTENCE UNFINISHED
THERE WAS TIK TOK FLAT UPON HIS BACK AND SLIDING HEADFOREMOST DOWN THE INCLINE AND THERE WERE THE OFFICERS OF THE ARMY OF OOGABOO ALL TANGLED UP IN A CONFUSED CROWD FLAPPING THEIR ARMS AND TRYING TO SHIELD THEIR FACES FROM THE CLANKING SWORDS
I MUST GO AND MAKE THE TEA SHE SAID IN A LIGHT COLD TONE AND TURNING SHE WENT BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM WHITHER AFTERNOON TEA HAD JUST BEEN CARRIED MARCELLA FOLLOWED READING THE NOTE WAS FROM MISS RAEBURN
THE STORY GIRL HAD NOT RECOVERED FROM THE MORTIFICATIONS OF THE PREVIOUS DAY SHE WOULD NOT TALK AND SHE WOULD NOT TELL A SINGLE STORY SHE SAT ON RACHEL WARD'S CHEST AND ATE HER BREAKFAST WITH THE AIR OF A MARTYR AFTER BREAKFAST SHE WASHED THE DISHES
BUT THEY EARNED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT ESPECIALLY IN WINTER FOR BENEVOLENT PEOPLE TOUCHED WITH THEIR DESTITUTION AND HALF NAKEDNESS GAVE THEM SOMETIMES A DOUBLET SOMETIMES A SHIRT OR SOME OTHER ARTICLE OF CLOTHING WHICH OF COURSE THEY IMMEDIATELY SOLD
THE SENATE DECREED THEM PUBLIC THANKS ORDERED THE MEN TO GIVE PLACE TO THEM UPON ALL OCCASIONS CAUSED AN ALTAR TO BE ERECTED FOR THEM ON THE SPOT WHERE THE MOTHER HAD SOFTENED HER SON AND THE WIFE HER HUSBAND
ASK ME TO SAY IT AGAIN LEARN IT BY HEART AND GO OFF REPEATING IT WITH A WORD WRONG HERE OR THERE TO ALL THE MILDER OF THE BEAST PEOPLE HE THOUGHT NOTHING OF WHAT WAS PLAIN AND COMPREHENSIBLE I INVENTED SOME VERY CURIOUS BIG THINKS FOR HIS ESPECIAL USE

THAT THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF GRASPING ANYTHING AND SO THE MAN TOLD THEM TO STOP WHERE THEY WERE AND HE WOULD COME TO THEM THEY HUDDLED TOGETHER AND WAITED AND HE CLIMBED DOWN AND CAME IN HE WAS A YOUNG KEEPER AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT AND NEW TO THE BUSINESS
AN ANTINOUS OF FAULTLESS BEAUTY A GRECIAN STATUE AS IT WERE INTO WHICH THE BREATH OF LIFE HAD BEEN BREATHED BY SOME MODERN PYGMALION SUCH A POMP OF GIFTS AND ENDOWMENTS SETTLING UPON ONE MAN'S HEAD
WHILE BEAUTY WAS DRESSING HERSELF A SERVANT BROUGHT WORD TO HER THAT HER SISTERS WERE COME WITH THEIR HUSBANDS TO PAY HER A VISIT THEY BOTH LIVED UNHAPPILY WITH THE GENTLEMEN THEY HAD MARRIED THE HUSBAND OF THE ELDEST WAS VERY HANDSOME BUT WAS SO VERY PROUD OF THIS
AND THOSE REASONS SHOW THAT SUCH CAUSES WOULD NOT ONLY BE MORE RARELY GIVEN BUT WOULD ALSO BE MORE EASILY ACCOMMODATED BY A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THAN EITHER BY THE STATE GOVERNMENTS OR THE PROPOSED LITTLE CONFEDERACIES
BUT NO MATTER I UNDERSTAND MYSELF AND I KNOW I HAVE NOT SAID ANYTHING VERY FOOLISH IN WHAT I HAVE SAID ONLY YOUR WORSHIP SENOR IS ALWAYS GRAVELLING AT EVERYTHING I SAY NAY EVERYTHING I DO

NONE I REPLIED I PUT IT ALL ON TO A WAITER HOW CLEVER OF YOU YOU REALLY DO SEEM TO BE A MOST CAPABLE PERSON AND SO MASTERFUL I BEGIN TO FEAR THAT SOME DAY YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY
TO FOLLOW HIS NATURAL BENT IN BEING SURROUNDED DAY AND NIGHT BY HIS RESPONSIBLE CHOSEN ASSOCIATES WITH WHOM HE WORKED UNINTERRUPTED BY OUTSIDERS FROM EARLY MORNING AWAY INTO THE LATE HOURS OF THE EVENING THOSE WHO WERE LABORING WITH HIM INSPIRED BY HIS UNFLAGGING ENTHUSIASM
JIMMY HAD A RESPECT FOR HIS FATHER'S SHREWDNESS IN BUSINESS MATTERS AND IN THIS CASE IT HAD BEEN HIS FATHER WHO HAD FIRST SUGGESTED THE INVESTMENT MONEY TO BE MADE IN THE MOTOR BUSINESS POTS OF MONEY MOREOVER SEGOUIN HAD THE UNMISTAKABLE AIR OF WEALTH
THEY ALL KNEW HOW SHE COULD WORK AND WHAT SHE COULD GIVE IF SHE CHOSE WHILE THAT SHE HAD STOOD AT THE ALTAR AND BEEN BAPTIZED MEANT THAT SOMETHING NOT CUSTOMARY WITH THE BATES FAMILY WAS TAKING PLACE IN HER HEART
THERE WAS NO NEED OF THAT CLOSE AND SEARCHING STUDY INTO PRINCIPLES AND PRECEDENTS WHICH KEEPS THE MODERN LAW STUDENT BURIED IN HIS OFFICE ON THE CONTRARY THE VERY CHARACTER OF THIS SIMPLE LITIGATION DREW THE LAWYER INTO THE STREET AND NEIGHBORHOOD
THE NATIVE MANUFACTURER WAS RUINED BY THE COLONIST TO MAINTAIN THE BEET ROOT THE CANE HAD TO BE TAXED TO PROTECT THE PROPERTY OF THE ONE IT BECAME NECESSARY TO VIOLATE THE PROPERTY OF THE OTHER THE MOST REMARKABLE FEATURE OF THIS BUSINESS WAS PRECISELY THAT TO WHICH THE LEAST ATTENTION WAS PAID
A HERETIC WILT THOU BE TO THYSELF AND A WIZARD AND A SOOTH SAYER AND A FOOL AND A DOUBTER AND A REPROBATE AND A VILLAIN READY MUST THOU BE TO BURN THYSELF IN THINE OWN FLAME

THEN SHE BEGAN TO THINK WITH A LITTLE TREMOR HOW ANGRY ARTHUR WOULD BE BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO THINK OF THAT NOW AND AFTER ALL SHE DID NOT STAND IN VERY GREAT DREAD OF THE CONSEQUENCES ESPECIALLY AS SHE FELT NEARLY SURE OF HER FATHER'S APPROVAL OF WHAT SHE HAD DONE
AND RICHES IT IS EVIDENT GO FAR TOWARDS FIXING THE CONDITION OF ANY PERSON IF BIRTH AND QUALITY ENTER FOR A SHARE THIS STILL AFFORDS US AN ARGUMENT TO OUR PRESENT PURPOSE FOR WHAT IS IT WE CALL A MAN OF BIRTH

IF THAT WERE POSSIBLE THE CROSS OLD NEIGHBOR ATTRACTED BY SHIRO'S BARKING HAD BEEN AN UNSEEN AND ENVIOUS WITNESS OF THE FINDING OF THE TREASURE HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE TOO WOULD LIKE TO FIND A FORTUNE
FOR HE WAS CONVINCED THAT BEFORE LONG THE ANOMALY OF WHICH HE HAD SPOKEN WOULD CEASE TO EXIST UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD REALLY BELIEVE IN THE WORK IT WAS DOING THERE WAS NO DOUBT AS TO THE SUCCESS OF HIS SPEECH
GOT UP AND DRESSED HE PUT HIS BEDROOM CANDLE AND MATCHES IN HIS POCKET CREPT DOWN STAIRS AND OUT OF THE HOUSE AND UP TO BEALE'S IT WAS A SLOW AND NERVOUS BUSINESS MORE THAN ONCE ON THE STAIRCASE HE THOUGHT HE HEARD A STAIR CREAK BEHIND HIM

FRANK SMILED BUT HE DID NOT LOOK DISPLEASED I'M GLAD MISTER BENCHLEY HAS SUCH A GOOD OPINION OF THE OUTDOOR CHUMS HE REMARKED FOR HE MEANT EVERY ONE OF YOU AS WELL AS ME WHEN HE SAID THAT
AND DISPOSE OF THE DETAILS YOU CAN PRODUCE IT WITHOUT EMBARRASSMENT WHEN ARRIVED AT THIS POINT ABSTAIN FROM THESE KINDS OF ANALYSIS WHICH THOUGH INDEED MORE CORRECT SEEM LABORED THEY HAVE BESIDES LESS FREEDOM APPROPRIATENESS AND GRACE
AND THE MONEY TOO THAT HE PAID FOR HIS GRAIN AND THE STEWARD DID AS JOSEPH COMMANDED AS SOON AS THE MORNING LIGHT APPEARED THE MEN WERE SENT AWAY WITH THEIR ASSES WHEN THEY HAD GONE OUT OF THE CITY BUT WERE NOT YET FAR AWAY

THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW IS TO REVEAL SIN THAT THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW CAN BE SEEN FROM THE ACCOUNT OF THE GIVING OF THE LAW AS REPORTED IN THE NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CHAPTERS OF EXODUS
THE MEN WHOM THEY WERE TO MEET WERE OF STAUNCH STOCK AND SPIRIT THEMSELVES BANKS THEIR COMMANDER HAD WORKED IN HIS YOUTH AS A COMMON LABORER IN A COTTON MILL AND HAD FORCED HIMSELF UP BY VIGOR AND ENERGY BUT SHIELDS WAS A VETERAN OF THE MEXICAN WAR
THEN THERE WAS A SCENE IN COURT AND IT APPEARED THAT NO LESS THAN FOUR MESSAGES HAD BEEN RECEIVED FROM PRAGUE ALL TO THE SAME EFFECT ONE HAD BEEN ADDRESSED BY MADAME GOESLER TO HER FRIEND THE DUCHESS AND THAT MESSAGE HAD CAUSED THE DUKE'S APPEARANCE ON THE SCENE
AND AFTER LUNCHEON THEY VISITED THE AQUARIUM AND THE TOP OF THE SINGER BUILDING AND TOOK THE SUBWAY UPTOWN TO SPEND AN HOUR WITH THE BIRDS OF AMERICA IN THEIR HABITATS SANDY WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY PRIED THEM AWAY FROM THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM IN TIME TO CATCH THE SIX FIFTEEN TRAIN

CARRYING A DRAWN CUTLASS RESTING EASILY UPON HIS ARM EDGE UP VERY MUCH AS A FINE GENTLEMAN CARRIES HIS HIGH SILK HAT AND ANY ONE WHO SHOULD IMPERTINENTLY STARE OR ENDEAVOR TO QUELL HIS HIGH SPIRITS IN ANY OTHER WAY
HE CLIMBED OVER THE STONES AND FOUND HIMSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARRIER HE WALKED VERY NEAR THE STREET POSTS AND GUIDED HIMSELF ALONG THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES A LITTLE BEYOND THE BARRICADE IT SEEMED TO HIM
PRESENTLY HE OPENED HIS EYES AND RAISED HIS HEAD A LITTLE LOOKING HALF FEARFULLY AROUND IT WAS HER VOICE HE WHISPERED HOARSELY IT CAME TO ME THROUGH THE SHADOWS WHERE IS SHE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HER
YOU ARE THE ONLY GENTLEMAN TO WHOM I WOULD HAVE SAID WHAT I DID ABOUT MY GIRTH BEING LOOSE AS TO THE NEW DANCE I DO NOT CARE TO LEARN IT BECAUSE I WOULD NOT DANCE IT WITH ANY MAN BUT YOU AND NOT EVEN WITH YOU YET

FRANK HAD AN IDEA THEY WOULD BE VISITED BY A BIG SNOWFALL BEFORE TWENTY FOUR HOURS HAD PASSED OF COURSE THAT'S ONLY A HAZARD FELLOWS HE TOLD BLUFF AND JERRY WHO WERE HELPING HIM ADD TO THE HANDY HEAP CLOSE TO THE DOOR OF THE CABIN
THE GIRL AWOKE WITH A START AND LEANT FORWARD TO GRASP HIM BUT HE WAS ALREADY FLYING OFF AND SHE ONLY SEIZED A FEATHER FROM HIS WING AND WHEN DAWN CAME SHE GOT UP AND TOLD THE WOMAN HE HAS GONE OVER THE HILL OF POISON SAID SHE
BUT STILL THE ORBIT WHICH THE HIGHEST PART OF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE MADE IS DERELICT SO THAT THE MOULD IS WHERE WAS ONCE THE CRUST HIS FAMILY THAT HAD STRAIGHT FORWARD MOVED WITH FEET UPON HIS FOOTPRINTS ARE TURNED ROUND SO THAT THEY SET THE POINT UPON THE HEEL
AND WHO PUT FORTH SENTENCE AFTER SENTENCE WHICH EVERY SCHOLAR PRESENT KNEW TO BE A PERVERSION OF THE FACTS SO OUTRAGEOUS AS TO BE LAUGHABLE AS ONE OF THE LEADING MORNING PAPERS SAID THE ABOVE IS NOT A REPLY TO ARGUMENTS MADE BY MISTER MANGASARIAN
BUT IF ANY ONE WERE TO ASK ME WHERE FRAUD AND HYPOCRISY MIGHT TRULY BE FOUND I SHOULD KNOW OF NO OTHER PLACE TO NAME THAN THE COURT WHERE DETRACTION ALWAYS WEARS THE MASK OF AMUSEMENT WHERE AT THE SAME TIME PEOPLE CUT AND SEW UP WOUND AND HEAL
EVER SINCE ENTERING THE ROOM HE HAD MAINTAINED A STUDIED SILENCE KEEPING HIS EYES AVERTED INSTEAD OF ACCORDING TO HIS USUAL CUSTOM CONSTANTLY STRAYING TOWARDS HIS COUSIN HE SATE NERVOUSLY IN HIS CHAIR AND ONCE OR TWICE
THIS MORNING WHEN I WENT TO SEE HIM AFTER HIS REPULSE OF VAN HELSING HIS MANNER WAS THAT OF A MAN COMMANDING DESTINY HE WAS IN FACT COMMANDING DESTINY SUBJECTIVELY HE DID NOT REALLY CARE FOR ANY OF THE THINGS OF MERE EARTH
AND FROM THEM THEY HEARD MANY SERIOUS AND AMUSING STORIES MANY TRUE TALES OF THE ATTACK AND RETREAT OF SHOT AND SHELL AND SHRAPNEL AND THE HAND GRENADE AND THE POISONOUS GAS BOMBS THROWN BY THE BOCHES AND THEN ONE BY ONE THE SOLDIERS OF UNCLE SAM DROPPED OFF INTO LONG
AND THEN THE EMPTY STREET SEEMED TO THREATEN AN AMBUSH WE THOUGHT HASTILY OF SUNKEN MINES OF SOLDIERS CROUCHING BEHIND THE BARRIERS BEHIND THE HOUSES AT THE NEXT CORNER OF MAUSERS COVERING US FROM THE LATTICED BALCONIES OVERHEAD
THOSE LITTLE STATES ARE ALWAYS SCREECHING YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT DICK'S LUCK YES HE HAS BEEN CALLED UP TO NOTORIETY HASN'T HE I HOPE YOU KEEP HIM PROPERLY HUMBLE HE WANTS SUPPRESSING FROM TIME TO TIME HE DOES

HE CALLED BOTH LYMAN CASS THE MILLER AND THE FINN HOMESTEADER FROM LOST LAKE BY THEIR FIRST NAMES HE WAS KNOWN AS THE RED SWEDE AND CONSIDERED SLIGHTLY INSANE BJORNSTAM COULD DO ANYTHING WITH HIS HANDS SOLDER A PAN
BUT HIS CAPACITY WAS SCARCELY EQUAL TO WHAT HIS GREAT PLACE REQUIRED HE HAD BECOME SLUGGISH AND SELF INDULGENT LIKED THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY AND OF THE TABLE BETTER THAN BUSINESS AND ON GREAT EMERGENCIES
THE OPENING IS VERY IMPRESSIVE THE NERVE PULP BEING HARASSED BY THE GRADUALLY SWELLING PRELUDE THERE IS DEFIANT POWER IN THE FIRST THEME AND THE CONSTANT REFERENCE TO IT BETRAYS THE COMPOSER'S EXASPERATED MENTAL CONDITION
AND SAT WATCHING OLAF AS HE MOTHERED THE HALF BAKED BANNOCK LOAF IT MADE HIM THINK OF HIS FATHER A THOUSAND TIMES THE TWO MUST HAVE CAMPED LIKE THIS IN THE DAYS WHEN ALASKA WAS NEW AND THERE WERE NO MAPS TO TELL THEM WHAT LAY BEYOND THE NEXT RANGE
AS SOON AS IT BOILS UP WELL TAKE IT FROM THE FIRE LET IT REMAIN FOR A MINUTE THEN TAKE OFF THE SCUM SET IT BACK ON THE FIRE AND LET IT BOIL A MINUTE THEN TAKE IT OFF AND SKIM IT AGAIN THIS OPERATION REPEAT TILL THE SYRUP IS CLEAR
HE MADE MY MOUTH WATER THE VERY LAST TIME I SAW HIM SEEMS TO ME I CAN SMELL HIM NOW IF HE HAD MADE THIS HOLE JUST A LITTLE BIT BIGGER I WOULD GO DOWN AND PULL HIM OUT BUT I AM TOO TIRED TO DO ANY DIGGING NOW
AND IN MANY CASES WHEN OTHER WHITE MEN WHO WERE CALLED PATROLS CAUGHT COLORED PEOPLE AWAY FROM HOME WITHOUT TICKETS AND WERE ABOUT TO WHIP THEM MISTER BROWN WOULD RIDE UP AND SAY THE FIRST MAN WHO RAISES A WHIP AT ONE OF THOSE NEGROES I WILL BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT
AND ONE OF THE CONJURING PARTIES HAD LIT UP THIS DISK AT THE WATER'S EDGE THEY HAD MADE IT OF WAX WITH GREAT EXACTNESS AND PRESENTLY IT WAS AT FULL IT WAS AN IMPOSING SIGHT
AND I CAN MORE EASILY BE INDUCED WITH YOU WHEN ALL MY APPREHENSIONS ARE OVER TO CONSIDER HIS PROPOSAL OF MISTER WILLIAMS THAN I COULD HERE AND HE PRETENDS AS YOU HAVE READ IN HIS LETTER
ALLOW A POUND OF LOGWOOD TO EACH POUND OF GOODS THAT ARE TO BE DYED SOAK IT OVER NIGHT IN SOFT WATER THEN BOIL IT AN HOUR AND STRAIN THE WATER IN WHICH IT IS BOILED
AND THREW OFF HIS RAGS AND BEARD AND PUT ON HIS PRINCELY ROBES THE PRINCESS TOOK HER TURN IN THE BAKEHOUSE AND DID AS HACON BADE HER FOR SHE STOLE BREAD TILL HER POCKETS WERE CRAMMED FULL SO WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT TO GO HOME AT EVEN THE PRINCE SAID
BUT ARE NOW DEAD WE ARE ENTITLED TO CONCLUDE THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE MORTAL WE MIGHT SURELY WITHOUT ANY LOGICAL INCONSEQUENCE HAVE CONCLUDED AT ONCE FROM THOSE INSTANCES THAT THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON IS MORTAL
AFTER A DAZZLING MOMENT AN ECLIPSE WE LOOK WE HASTEN WE STRETCH OUT OUR HANDS TO GRASP WHAT IS PASSING EACH EVENT IS A TURN IN THE ROAD AND ALL AT ONCE WE ARE OLD WE FEEL A SHOCK ALL IS BLACK WE DISTINGUISH AN OBSCURE DOOR
AND ESPECIALLY THE FACTS REGARDING THE WORK OF THE GRADUATES HAS BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OUTRIGHT BEGGING I THINK THAT THE PRESENTATION OF FACTS ON A HIGH DIGNIFIED PLANE IS ALL THE BEGGING THAT MOST RICH PEOPLE CARE FOR
THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY AN OUTBURST OF YELLS AND CRIES IN FRONT AND HE SET SPURS TO HIS HORSE AND DASHED FORWARD AT A GALLOP HE WAS NEARLY THROUGH THE KLOOF WHEN A BODY OF KAFFIRS WHO WERE RUNNING THROUGH THE WOOD FROM THE RIGHT BURST SUDDENLY FROM THE BUSHES INTO THE PATH
THE INERTIA OF A CENTURY CARRIES HIM AND HIS GERMANY ONWARD FROM SUCCESS TO SUCCESS BUT FOR ALL THAT ONE MAY DOUBT WHETHER THE EXTRAORDINARY INTELLECTUALITY THAT DISTINGUISHED THE GERMAN ATMOSPHERE IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE CENTURY AND IN WHICH SUCH MEN AS BLUMENTHAL AND MOLTKE
THE PRINCE TOLD THE KING NOT TO DESPAIR FOR THOUGH HE MIGHT GO AWAY HE WAS CERTAIN TO RETURN TO HIM HIS FATHER PROVIDED HIM WITH A HANDSOME HORSE WITH GOLDEN STIRRUPS AND THE QUEEN GAVE HIM A CROSS TO WEAR ABOUT HIS NECK

I WILL WAIT TILL SHE COMES BACK HE SAID TO HIMSELF IF I HAVE TO WAIT TILL THE WORLD ENDS SO HE THREW HIMSELF DOWN ON THE GRASS AND LAY LOOKING UP AT THE STARS TILL HE WENT TO SLEEP EARLY IN THE MORNING
HE OPENED HIS SACK AND GAVE HER THE BAD ONE THE WITCH SUSPECTED NO EVIL AND HER MOUTH WATERED TO TASTE THE NEW DISH SO THAT SHE WENT INTO THE KITCHEN TO PREPARE IT HERSELF WHEN IT WAS READY SHE COULD NOT WAIT TILL IT WAS SERVED AT THE TABLE
