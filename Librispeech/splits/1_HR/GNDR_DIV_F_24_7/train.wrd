BUT IF YOU THINK IT WRONG YOU HAD MUCH BETTER CHANGE THERE CRIED ISABELLA YOU HEAR WHAT YOUR SISTER SAYS AND YET YOU WILL NOT MIND HER
ON THE VERY MORNING AFTER HIS HAVING HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HER WELL SIR AND I DARE SAY YOU ARE NOT SORRY TO BE BACK AGAIN FOR IT IS JUST THE PLACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND INDEED FOR EVERYBODY ELSE TOO
HEAVY FLAKES OF SNOW WERE FALLING THICKLY FLAKES AS LARGE AND NEARLY AS HEAVY AS A CROWN PIECE RENDERING THE ATMOSPHERE SO DENSE AND OBSCURE THAT A MAN COULD NOT SEE A YARD BEFORE HIM MISTER CARLYLE HAD DRIVEN HOME IN THE PONY CARRIAGE
MISSUS HUGHES COULD NOT HAVE APPLIED TO ANY CREATURE IN THE ROOM MORE HAPPY TO OBLIGE HER THAN CATHERINE
SHE SAT ON FIVE MINUTES LONGER AND THEN LEFT WISHING MISTER CARLYLE GOOD NIGHT HE RESUMED HIS READING BUT ANOTHER PAGE OR TWO CONCLUDED THE ARTICLE UPON WHICH MISTER CARLYLE THREW THE BOOK ON THE TABLE
WAS VERY IMPORTUNATE WITH ISABELLA TO STAND UP BUT JOHN WAS GONE INTO THE CARD ROOM TO SPEAK TO A FRIEND AND NOTHING SHE DECLARED
WHEN SHE WAS IN ONE OF HER RESOLUTE MOODS WOULD BE OF NO USE MISTER CARLYLE OPENED THE DOOR DEXTEROUSLY SWUNG HIMSELF THROUGH IT AND SHUT IT AFTER HIM
PREVENTED THEIR DOING MORE THAN GOING THROUGH THE FIRST RUDIMENTS OF AN ACQUAINTANCE BY INFORMING THEMSELVES HOW WELL THE OTHER LIKED BATH HOW MUCH SHE ADMIRED ITS BUILDINGS AND SURROUNDING COUNTRY WHETHER SHE DREW OR PLAYED OR SANG
WHO WAS IT QUIVERED RICHARD AS JOYCE WAS HEARD GOING AWAY IT WAS JOYCE WHAT IS SHE HERE STILL
OF THE HORSES AND DOGS OF THE FRIEND WHOM HE HAD JUST LEFT AND OF A PROPOSED EXCHANGE OF TERRIERS BETWEEN THEM INTEREST HER SO MUCH AS TO PREVENT HER LOOKING VERY OFTEN TOWARDS THAT PART OF THE ROOM WHERE SHE HAD LEFT MISTER TILNEY
I HAVE BEEN PRETTY NEARLY EVER SINCE ON MY FEET REACHING HERE I ONLY GOT A LIFT NOW AND THEN BUT RICHARD DO YOU KNOW THAT WEST LYNNE IS THE VERY WORST PLACE YOU COULD HAVE FLOWN TO
HER CHEST SORE AND HER VOICE GOING IN SHORT AT HAVING FOR ONCE IN HER LIFE CAUGHT A COLD LIKE ORDINARY MORTALS WHAT'S THE TIME I WONDER SHE EXCLAIMED
I KNOW YOU WILL NOT MIND MY GOING AWAY AND I DARE SAY JOHN WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT AND THEN YOU MAY EASILY FIND ME OUT CATHERINE THOUGH A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
THAT JOURNAL IS ALL SO STRANGE AND I HESITATED TO GO ON BUT HE WAS SO SWEET AND KIND AND HE HAD PROMISED TO HELP AND I TRUSTED HIM SO I SAID
HE THOUGHT HE SAW SOME ONE WHO RECALLED SOMETHING TERRIBLE SOMETHING WHICH LED TO HIS BRAIN FEVER AND HERE THE WHOLE THING SEEMED TO OVERWHELM ME IN A RUSH THE PITY FOR JONATHAN THE HORROR WHICH HE EXPERIENCED THE WHOLE FEARFUL MYSTERY OF HIS DIARY
SO I HANDED HIM THE SHORTHAND DIARY HE TOOK IT WITH A GRATEFUL BOW AND SAID MAY I READ IT IF YOU WISH I ANSWERED AS DEMURELY AS I COULD HE OPENED IT AND FOR AN INSTANT HIS FACE FELL THEN HE STOOD UP AND BOWED
SHE TRACES BY INFERENCE CERTAIN THINGS TO A SLEEP WALKING IN WHICH SHE PUTS DOWN THAT YOU SAVED HER IN GREAT PERPLEXITY THEN I COME TO YOU AND ASK YOU OUT OF YOUR SO MUCH KINDNESS TO TELL ME ALL OF IT THAT YOU CAN REMEMBER
AND NOW TELL ME ALL ABOUT HIM WHEN IT CAME TO SPEAKING TO THIS GREAT LEARNED MAN I BEGAN TO FEAR THAT HE WOULD THINK ME A WEAK FOOL AND JONATHAN A MADMAN
IT WAS SO FUNNY TO HEAR MY WIFE CALLED MADAM MINA BY THIS KINDLY STRONG FACED OLD MAN I SMILED AND SAID I WAS ILL I HAVE HAD A SHOCK BUT YOU HAVE CURED ME ALREADY AND HOW
AND IF THEY BROUGHT HIM ALL THE WAY FROM HOLLAND TO LOOK AFTER LUCY I FEEL FROM HAVING SEEN HIM THAT HE IS GOOD AND KIND AND OF A NOBLE NATURE WHEN HE COMES TO MORROW I SHALL ASK HIM ABOUT JONATHAN
SHALL BE FOR YOU AND THOSE YOU LOVE
I HAD BEEN THINKING THAT IT WAS OF DEAR LUCY THAT YOU WISHED TO ASK AND SO THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE TIME TO WAIT NOT ON MY ACCOUNT BUT BECAUSE I KNOW YOUR TIME MUST BE PRECIOUS I HAVE WRITTEN IT OUT ON THE TYPEWRITER FOR YOU HE TOOK IT AND HIS EYES GLISTENED
I CANNOT HELP FEELING TERRIBLY EXCITED AS THE TIME DRAWS NEAR FOR THE VISIT OF DOCTOR VAN HELSING FOR SOMEHOW I EXPECT THAT IT WILL THROW SOME LIGHT UPON JONATHAN'S SAD EXPERIENCE AND AS HE ATTENDED POOR DEAR LUCY IN HER LAST ILLNESS HE CAN TELL ME ALL ABOUT HER
MINA IS DRESSING AND I SHALL CALL AT THE HOTEL IN A FEW MINUTES AND BRING HIM OVER HE WAS I THINK SURPRISED TO SEE ME WHEN I CAME INTO THE ROOM WHERE HE WAS AND INTRODUCED MYSELF
CAN YOU TELL ME WHY WHEN OTHER SPIDERS DIE SMALL AND SOON THAT ONE GREAT SPIDER LIVED FOR CENTURIES IN THE TOWER OF THE OLD SPANISH CHURCH AND GREW AND GREW
WHEN IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS NEW MOTHER ON THE OCCASION FOR A FEW DAYS EVERY MORNING VISIT IN HIGHBURY INCLUDED SOME MENTION OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISSUS WESTON HAD RECEIVED
AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE
SHE WAS SHORT PLUMP AND FAIR WITH A FINE BLOOM BLUE EYES LIGHT HAIR REGULAR FEATURES AND A LOOK OF GREAT SWEETNESS AND BEFORE THE END OF THE EVENING EMMA WAS AS MUCH PLEASED WITH HER MANNERS AS HER PERSON
NOT UNWILLING TO TALK AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD
UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART BUT MY DEAR PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES THEY ARE SILLY THINGS AND BREAK UP ONE'S FAMILY CIRCLE GRIEVOUSLY
FOR HAVING BEEN A VALETUDINARIAN ALL HIS LIFE WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY
AND MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE
AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY
AND WHILE HIS HOSPITALITY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING
MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME
THROUGH AT HARTFIELD BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND
THE EVENT HAD EVERY PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER FRIEND MISTER WESTON WAS A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER EASY FORTUNE SUITABLE AGE AND PLEASANT MANNERS
RATIONAL OR PLAYFUL THE EVIL OF THE ACTUAL DISPARITY IN THEIR AGES AND MISTER WOODHOUSE HAD NOT MARRIED EARLY WAS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HABITS
TAYLOR WHEN THEY LEFT HER AT RANDALLS IN THE CENTRE OF EVERY DOMESTIC COMFORT OR SAW HER GO AWAY IN THE EVENING ATTENDED BY HER PLEASANT HUSBAND TO A CARRIAGE OF HER OWN
THAT THEY MAY FALL IN THE POWDER MAGAZINE OF THE EXPECTANT AUDIENCE THE HUMOROUS POEM WAS ADMIRABLY RECITED AND THE SPEAKER MUCH APPLAUDED
THE COUNCILLOR STOOD STILL AND WATCHED A MOST STRANGE PROCESSION PASS BY FIRST CAME A DOZEN DRUMMERS WHO UNDERSTOOD PRETTY WELL HOW TO HANDLE THEIR INSTRUMENTS THEN CAME HALBERDIERS AND SOME ARMED WITH CROSS BOWS THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE PROCESSION WAS A PRIEST
SOME PRAISED THAT PERIOD AS FAR MORE INTERESTING FAR MORE POETICAL THAN OUR OWN TOO SOBER PRESENT INDEED COUNCILLOR KNAP DEFENDED THIS OPINION SO WARMLY THAT THE HOSTESS DECLARED IMMEDIATELY ON HIS SIDE AND BOTH EXERTED THEMSELVES WITH UNWEARIED ELOQUENCE
I MISSED MY GOOD OLD MOTHER AND THE DEAR LITTLE ONES WHO ALMOST TEAR ME TO PIECES FOR SHEER LOVE HE SEATED HIMSELF ONCE MORE AND NODDED THE DREAM CONTINUED TO HAUNT HIM FOR HE STILL HAD THE SHOES ON HIS FEET A FALLING STAR SHONE IN THE DARK FIRMAMENT
THERE FALLS ANOTHER STAR SAID HE BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER THERE ARE ALWAYS ENOUGH LEFT I SHOULD NOT MUCH MIND EXAMINING THE LITTLE GLIMMERING THINGS SOMEWHAT NEARER ESPECIALLY THE MOON FOR THAT WOULD NOT SLIP SO EASILY THROUGH A MAN'S FINGERS WHEN WE DIE
HEM HEM SAID THE CLERK BREATHLESSLY AND QUITE EXHAUSTED HE SEATED HIMSELF ON A BANK
REPLIED CARE IN A SEVERE TONE OF REPROACH NO HE WILL BE VERY UNHAPPY AND WILL ASSUREDLY BLESS THE MOMENT WHEN HE FEELS THAT HE HAS FREED HIMSELF FROM THE FATAL SHOES STUPID NONSENSE SAID THE OTHER ANGRILY
WOULD JOIN THEM OUT OF CURIOSITY AND WOULD GREET HIM WITH A WILD HURRAH WHILE HE WAS STANDING IN HIS PILLORY THERE WOULD BE A MOB A HISSING AND REJOICING AND JEERING TEN TIMES WORSE THAN IN THE ROWS ABOUT THE JEWS SOME YEARS AGO
AND A FEW SECONDS AFTER LIFE BEGAN TO SHOW ITSELF IN THE MAN HE ASSERTED THAT THE PRECEDING NIGHT HAD BEEN THE WORST THAT EVER THE MALICE OF FATE HAD ALLOTTED HIM HE WOULD NOT FOR TWO SILVER MARKS AGAIN GO THROUGH WHAT HE HAD ENDURED WHILE MOON STRICKEN BUT NOW HOWEVER IT WAS OVER
SO HE PUT THEM ON QUICKLY STUCK HIS PAPERS IN HIS POCKET AND TOOK BESIDES A FEW UNDER HIS ARM INTENDING TO LOOK THEM THROUGH AT HOME TO MAKE THE NECESSARY NOTES IT WAS NOON AND THE WEATHER THAT HAD THREATENED RAIN BEGAN TO CLEAR UP WHILE GAILY DRESSED HOLIDAY FOLKS FILLED THE STREETS
HAD THE WATCH THAT EVENING THE RAIN POURED DOWN IN TORRENTS YET DESPITE THESE TWO OBSTACLES THE YOUNG MAN WAS OBLIGED TO GO OUT IF IT WERE BUT FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND AS TO TELLING THE DOOR KEEPER ABOUT IT THAT HE THOUGHT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY
THIS THE LIEUTENANT FELT MOST POIGNANTLY AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE LEANT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW AND SIGHED SO DEEPLY
AND INSTANTLY THROUGH IT SLIPPED EASILY AND WITHOUT PAIN NOTWITHSTANDING IT WAS PRETTY LARGE AND THICK BUT NOW THE REST OF THE BODY WAS TO BE GOT THROUGH AH I AM MUCH TOO STOUT GROANED HE ALOUD WHILE FIXED AS IN A VICE
YET THERE WAS THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE INSTITUTION THE CASTS WERE TAKEN AT THE ENTRY OF THE PATIENT
WHEN THE CREAM WILL BE THICK AND RICH AND CHURNS EASIER IF THE WEATHER IS VERY COLD AND THE CREAM HAS BEEN CHILLED HAVE A LARGE POT OF WATER OVER THE FIRE SET IN THE BUCKET WHEN IT IS NEAR BOILING HEAT AND KEEP STIRRING TILL IT IS MILK WARM HAVE THE CHURN SCALDED AND PUT IT IN
THREE THE MASTER SAID
OBTAINED BY POST FROM A SECOND HAND BOOKSELLER HE ABANDONED THE NOW FAMILIAR IONIC FOR A NEW DIALECT AND FOR A LONG TIME ONWARD LIMITED HIS READING ALMOST ENTIRELY TO THE GOSPELS AND EPISTLES IN GRIESBACH'S TEXT
IT HAD ALL COME OF READING HEATHEN WORKS EXCLUSIVELY THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE CONVINCED HE WAS OF HIS INCONSISTENCY HE BEGAN TO WONDER WHETHER HE COULD BE READING QUITE THE RIGHT BOOKS FOR HIS OBJECT IN LIFE
AS DURING THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE SALTS THEY CORRODE THE GLAZING AND THE BUTTER BECOMES RANCID AND UNHEALTHY A FRIEND OF MINE AND A LADY OF MUCH EXPERIENCE REMARKED ON READING THE ABOVE
THE MASTER SAID A MAN AND HIS FAULTS ARE OF A PIECE BY WATCHING HIS FAULTS WE LEARN WHETHER LOVE BE HIS EIGHT THE MASTER SAID
TO BEGUILE HIS LONELY WALKS BY IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS THEREIN I HAVE READ TWO BOOKS OF THE ILIAD BESIDES BEING PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH PASSAGES SUCH AS THE SPEECH OF PHOENIX IN THE NINTH BOOK THE FIGHT OF HECTOR AND AJAX IN THE FOURTEENTH
HE WAS FREQUENTLY MET IN THE LANES BY PEDESTRIANS AND OTHERS WITHOUT HIS SEEING THEM AND BY DEGREES THE PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HIS METHOD OF COMBINING WORK AND PLAY SUCH THEY CONSIDERED HIS READING TO BE WHICH
ON A DAY WHEN FAWLEY WAS GETTING QUITE ADVANCED BEING NOW ABOUT SIXTEEN
WHO HAD DRAWN HIM TO HER WHICH MADE IT NECESSARY THAT HE SHOULD ASSERT MERE SPORTIVENESS ON HIS PART AS HIS REASON IN SEEKING HER SOMETHING IN HER QUITE ANTIPATHETIC TO THAT SIDE OF HIM WHICH HAD BEEN OCCUPIED WITH LITERARY STUDY AND THE MAGNIFICENT CHRISTMINSTER DREAM
AS BY THE LIGHT OF A FALLING LAMP ONE MIGHT MOMENTARILY SEE AN INSCRIPTION ON A WALL BEFORE BEING ENSHROUDED IN DARKNESS AND THEN THIS PASSING DISCRIMINATIVE POWER WAS WITHDRAWN
HERODOTUS AESCHYLUS SOPHOCLES ARISTOPHANES
ULTIMATELY HE DECIDED THAT IN HIS SHEER LOVE OF READING HE HAD TAKEN UP A WRONG EMOTION FOR A CHRISTIAN YOUNG MAN HE HAD DABBLED IN CLARKE'S HOMER BUT HAD NEVER YET WORKED MUCH AT THE NEW TESTAMENT IN THE GREEK THOUGH HE POSSESSED A COPY
THIS ISLAND WAS INHABITED ONLY BY THESE TWO VIVISECTORS AND THEIR ANIMALISED VICTIMS SOME OF THESE NO DOUBT THEY COULD PRESS INTO THEIR SERVICE AGAINST ME IF NEED AROSE I KNEW BOTH MOREAU AND MONTGOMERY CARRIED REVOLVERS
AND IF JACK AND I CHOOSE TO HAVE A QUICK RUN NOW AND THEN TO PLEASE OURSELVES THAT'S OUR BUSINESS AND NOT YOURS WELL SAID LARRY YOU'LL NEVER BE A RICH MAN MOST LIKELY NOT SAID JERRY
ONE DAY TWO WILD LOOKING YOUNG MEN CAME OUT OF A TAVERN CLOSE BY THE STAND AND CALLED JERRY HERE CABBY LOOK SHARP WE ARE RATHER LATE PUT ON THE STEAM WILL YOU AND TAKE US TO THE VICTORIA IN TIME FOR THE ONE O'CLOCK TRAIN
HE HELD HIS OWN HAND OUT AND COUNTED HIS DIGITS SLOWLY ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE EIGH I DID NOT GRASP HIS MEANING THEN
IF YOU WANT TO GET THROUGH LONDON FAST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IT WANTS A DEAL OF PRACTICE JERRY AND I WERE USED TO IT AND NO ONE COULD BEAT US AT GETTING THROUGH WHEN WE WERE SET UPON IT I WAS QUICK AND BOLD
AND SAVE FOR A FEEBLE BAR OF DEAL SPIKED WITH A SMALL NAIL THE MEREST MOCKERY OF A MACE I WAS UNARMED
AND A GOOD HORSE WHO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER ARE OF ONE MIND IT IS WONDERFUL WHAT THEY CAN DO I HAD A VERY GOOD MOUTH THAT IS I COULD BE GUIDED BY THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF THE REIN AND THAT IS A GREAT THING IN LONDON
IN SHELTERED LAKE HOLLOWS ON BEDS OF ALLUVIUM THIS PINE VARIES SO FAR FROM THE COMMON FORM THAT FREQUENTLY IT COULD BE TAKEN FOR A DISTINCT SPECIES GROWING IN DAMP SODS LIKE GRASSES FROM FORTY TO EIGHTY FEET HIGH
ITS FINE COLOR AND PICTURESQUENESS ARE APPRECIATED BY ARTISTS BUT TO ME THE JUNIPER SEEMS A SINGULARLY STRANGE AND TACITURN TREE I HAVE SPENT MANY A DAY AND NIGHT IN ITS COMPANY
AND AS READY AS A HOSPITAL RABBIT FOR MY FATE HE EMERGED BEHIND THE CORNER FOR I HEARD HIM SHOUT PRENDICK THEN HE BEGAN TO RUN AFTER ME SHOUTING THINGS AS HE RAN THIS TIME RUNNING BLINDLY
IT SEEMS TO BE A SURVIVOR OF SOME ANCIENT RACE WHOLLY UNACQUAINTED WITH ITS NEIGHBORS ITS BROAD STUMPINESS OF COURSE MAKES WIND WAVING OR EVEN SHAKING OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT IT IS NOT THIS ROCKY RIGIDITY THAT CONSTITUTES ITS SILENCE
AND THE ONLY SOUND NEAR ME WAS THE THIN HUM OF SOME SMALL GNATS THAT HAD DISCOVERED ME PRESENTLY I BECAME AWARE OF A DROWSY BREATHING SOUND
AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND FEET EXTENDING ITS TOUGH RATHER SLENDER ARMS IN THE FROSTY AIR WELCOMING THE STORMS AND FEEDING ON THEM AND REACHING SOMETIMES TO THE GRAND OLD AGE
ON THE PRESENT OCCASION FOR THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR VISITOR TOWARDS WHOSE AMUSEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE HE WISHED TO ENGAGE THEM FOR BOTH YOU MUST DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT SAID HE
WHICH OUGHT TO BE IRREGULAR AND RUGGED AND DISTANT OBJECTS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE INDISTINCT THROUGH THE SOFT MEDIUM OF A HAZY ATMOSPHERE YOU MUST BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH ADMIRATION AS I CAN HONESTLY GIVE I CALL IT A VERY FINE COUNTRY
I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THE STORY GIRL HONESTLY I THOUGHT IT WAS A BELL WHEN I HEARD IT AND THE DOOR OPEN TOO LET US BE FAIR FELICITY
SHE WAS UPON THE WHOLE LEFT ONE OF THE HAPPIEST CREATURES IN THE WORLD WHILE TALKING TO EACH OTHER
PERHAPS YOU DID NOT KNOW I HAD BEEN THERE I WAS NOT WITHIN AT THE TIME BUT I HEARD OF IT FROM ELEANOR AND SHE HAS BEEN WISHING EVER SINCE TO SEE YOU TO EXPLAIN THE REASON OF SUCH INCIVILITY BUT PERHAPS I CAN DO IT AS WELL IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT MY FATHER
I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WOULDN'T MIND IF HE'D LAUGH ONCE AND HAVE IT DONE WITH IT
THERE'S NO USE ASKING THE MEANING OF THIS I SUPPOSE SAID UNCLE ROGER WITH THE CALM OF DESPAIR I'VE GAVE UP TRYING TO FATHOM YOU YOUNG ONES PETER WHERE'S THE KEY WHAT YARN HAVE YOU BEEN TELLING
ONE BITTER DAY WHEN THEY SEEK IT
WAS WHITE AND CLEAR AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF SPRUCES WE WERE WOEFULLY TIRED BUT WE COULD NOT SIT DOWN BECAUSE THE GRASS WAS REEKING WITH DEW THE FAMILY GHOST ONLY APPEARS IN DAYLIGHT SAID THE STORY GIRL
TO WHAT A DEGREE OF UNFORGIVINGNESS IT MIGHT WITH PROPRIETY LEAD NOR TO WHAT RIGOURS OF RUDENESS IN RETURN IT MIGHT JUSTLY MAKE HER AMENABLE DEJECTED AND HUMBLED SHE HAD EVEN SOME THOUGHTS OF NOT GOING WITH THE OTHERS TO THE THEATRE THAT NIGHT
VERY FEW CATS HAVE AND MOST OF THEM HAVE SUCH AN INORDINATE APPETITE FOR FLATTERY THAT THEY WILL SWALLOW ANY AMOUNT OF IT AND THRIVE THEREON PADDY HAD A FINER TASTE THE STORY GIRL AND I WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD PAY HIM COMPLIMENTS TO HIS LIKING
I DO NOT LIKE RUINED TATTERED COTTAGES I AM NOT FOND OF NETTLES OR THISTLES OR HEATH BLOSSOMS I HAVE MORE PLEASURE IN A SNUG FARM HOUSE THAN A WATCH TOWER
AND HE BEING HURRIED FOR TIME AND NOT CARING TO HAVE IT PUT OFF MADE A POINT OF HER BEING DENIED THAT WAS ALL I DO ASSURE YOU
THAT THE HAIR WAS HER OWN SHE INSTANTANEOUSLY FELT AS WELL SATISFIED AS MARIANNE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT WHAT MARIANNE CONSIDERED AS A FREE GIFT FROM HER SISTER ELINOR WAS CONSCIOUS MUST HAVE BEEN PROCURED BY SOME THEFT OR CONTRIVANCE UNKNOWN TO HERSELF
HUCKLE EXECUTIVE
WHOSE DUTY IT IS TO ENFORCE THE WISHES OF THE LEGISLATIVE POWER UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT SHALL BE PLEASED TO PRONOUNCE THEM INVALID AND OF NO EFFECT
ONE WHO SERVES HIS COUNTRY BY RESIDING ABROAD YET IS NOT AN AMBASSADOR
I CAME TO TYPHOID FEVER READ THE SYMPTOMS
AND HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING WITH ME IT WAS MY LIVER THAT WAS OUT OF ORDER I KNEW IT WAS MY LIVER THAT WAS OUT OF ORDER BECAUSE I HAD JUST BEEN READING A PATENT LIVER PILL CIRCULAR
FROM THE OFFICER OF LOWER RANK TO WHOM HIS DEATH WOULD GIVE PROMOTION EPICURE
IT'S PERFECTLY AWFUL STUFF MARILLA SHE GROANED I'M SURE I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE HEAD OR TAIL OF IT THERE IS NO SCOPE FOR IMAGINATION IN IT AT ALL MISTER PHILLIPS SAYS I'M THE WORST DUNCE HE EVER SAW AT IT
USEFUL PRESCRIPTIONS CURE FOR LIVER COMPLAINT IN CHILDREN
AND WE DREW UP TO THE TABLE AND TOYED WITH A LITTLE STEAK AND ONIONS AND SOME RHUBARB TART I MUST HAVE BEEN VERY WEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I KNOW AFTER THE FIRST HALF HOUR OR SO I SEEMED TO TAKE NO INTEREST WHATEVER IN MY FOOD AN UNUSUAL THING FOR ME
THE POSITION FARTHEST REMOVED ON EITHER HAND FROM THE INTERLOCUTOR THE MAN WAS PERISHING APACE WHO PLAYED THE TAMBOURINE THE SEAL OF DEATH WAS ON HIS FACE TWAS PALLID FOR TWAS CLEAN THIS IS THE END
SHE HAD BEEN TOLD BY MISTER PHILLIPS TO SIT WITH THE MODEL MINNIE ANDREWS SHE FOUND ON HER DESK A BIG LUSCIOUS STRAWBERRY APPLE ANNE CAUGHT IT UP ALL READY TO TAKE A BITE WHEN SHE REMEMBERED THAT THE ONLY PLACE IN AVONLEA WHERE STRAWBERRY APPLES GREW
THE EXCEPTION PROVES THE RULE IS AN EXPRESSION CONSTANTLY UPON THE LIPS OF THE IGNORANT WHO PARROT IT FROM ONE ANOTHER WITH NEVER A THOUGHT OF ITS ABSURDITY IN THE LATIN EXCEPTIO PROBAT REGULAM
HIGH PINNACLED UPON THE THRONE OF THOUGHT HIS FACE SUFFUSED WITH THE DIM SPLENDORS OF THE TRANSFIGURATION HIS LEGS INTERTWISTED AND HIS TONGUE A CHEEK THE EDITOR SPILLS HIS WILL ALONG THE PAPER AND CUTS IT OFF IN LENGTHS TO SUIT
UNTIL HAVING PERHAPS BEEN ENFORCED FOR MANY YEARS SOMEBODY OBJECTS TO ITS OPERATION AGAINST HIMSELF I MEAN HIS CLIENT THE PRESIDENT IF HE APPROVES IT BEGINS TO EXECUTE IT AT ONCE
THE CUR FORETELLS THE KNELL OF PARTING DAY THE LOAFING HERD WINDS SLOWLY O'ER THE LEA THE WISE MAN HOMEWARD PLODS I ONLY STAY TO FIDDLE FADDLE IN A MINOR KEY ELOQUENCE
CHOLERA I HAD WITH SEVERE COMPLICATIONS AND DIPHTHERIA I SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN BORN WITH I PLODDED CONSCIENTIOUSLY THROUGH THE TWENTY SIX LETTERS AND THE ONLY MALADY I COULD CONCLUDE I HAD NOT GOT
THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS WITH THE FEMALE DURING WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS NOW FULLY FIT TO TRAVEL THE JED ORDERED THAT WE MOUNT AND RIDE AFTER THE MAIN COLUMN
AND SO I CAME CLOSE AND PEERED WITHIN AT ONE END OF THE CHAMBER UPON MASSIVE GOLDEN THRONES ENCRUSTED WITH DIAMONDS SAT THAN KOSIS AND HIS CONSORT
WHICH SEEMED TO MARK ALL THE GREATER WARRIORS AMONG THE WARHOONS AS WELL AS TO INDICATE THEIR AWFUL FEROCITY WHICH GREATLY TRANSCENDS EVEN THAT OF THE THARKS THE JEDDAK BAR COMAS WHO WAS COMPARATIVELY YOUNG
EVIL LOOKING PISTOL FROM ITS HOLSTER AND WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING AN END TO THE CREATURE WHEN I SPRANG FORWARD AND STRUCK UP HIS ARM THE BULLET STRIKING THE WOODEN CASING OF THE WINDOW EXPLODED
LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS
RISING AND APPROACHING MY COUCH HE SHOULD RENDER RARE SPORT FOR THE GREAT GAMES AND NOW AS MY EYES FELL UPON HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS NO THARK FOR HIS ORNAMENTS AND METAL WERE NOT OF THAT HORDE
WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
WITH DIRE FOREBODINGS I AM EVER WILLING TO STAND AND FIGHT WHEN THE ODDS ARE NOT TOO OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST ME BUT IN THIS INSTANCE I PERCEIVED NEITHER GLORY NOR PROFIT
WITH ARMS WIDE STRETCHED TO EASE HIS FALL AGAIN AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY I HAD RECOURSE TO EARTHLY TACTICS AND SWINGING MY RIGHT FIST FULL UPON THE POINT OF HIS CHIN
TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
AND SET IT ON THE STOVE
ONE CHOICE ONLY WAS LEFT THE STUARTS OR THE ARMY THE BANISHED FAMILY HAD COMMITTED GREAT FAULTS BUT IT HAD DEARLY EXPIATED THOSE FAULTS AND HAD UNDERGONE A LONG AND IT MIGHT BE HOPED A SALUTARY TRAINING IN THE SCHOOL OF ADVERSITY
AND NO ONE DARES TO PLUCK THEM UP BEFORE HE GIVES LEAVE
NOT ONLY FROM CONSTITUTION AND FROM HABIT BUT ALSO ON PRINCIPLE HE SEEMS TO HAVE LEARNED FROM THE THEOLOGIANS WHOM HE MOST ESTEEMED THAT BETWEEN HIM AND HIS SUBJECTS
AND FELT TOWARDS THOSE WHOM HE HAD DESERTED THAT PECULIAR MALIGNITY WHICH HAS IN ALL AGES BEEN CHARACTERISTIC OF APOSTATES
THE TRANSFUSION OF BLOOD THE PONDERATION OF AIR THE FIXATION OF MERCURY SUCCEEDED TO THAT PLACE IN THE PUBLIC MIND WHICH HAD BEEN LATELY OCCUPIED BY THE CONTROVERSIES OF THE ROTA
FOR EMOTIONS OF PIOUS ZEAL UNDER HIS DIRECTION EVERY CORNER OF THE REALM WAS SUBJECTED TO A CONSTANT AND MINUTE INSPECTION EVERY LITTLE CONGREGATION OF SEPARATISTS WAS TRACKED OUT AND BROKEN UP
AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE CROWN TO DEPRIVE THE COURTS OF LAW OF ALL INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY
DEATH WILL SOON COME AND PLANT THEM OVER AGAIN
WE ARE INFORMED BY CLARENDON THAT THERE WAS HARDLY A MAN OF NOTE IN THE REALM
HIS RAPID ELEVATION HIS PROSPERITY AND GLORY HIS INAUGURATION IN THE HALL AND HIS
HIS HUMANITY INGENUOUSNESS AND MODESTY THE MEDIOCRITY OF HIS ABILITIES AND THE DOCILITY WITH WHICH HE SUBMITTED TO THE GUIDANCE OF PERSONS WISER THAN HIMSELF ADMIRABLY QUALIFIED HIM TO BE THE HEAD OF A LIMITED MONARCHY
KNOW FROM ME THAT THE ONE FLOWER WAS THY OWN CHILD IT WAS THY CHILD'S FATE THOU SAW'ST THY OWN CHILD'S FUTURE LIFE THEN THE MOTHER SCREAMED WITH TERROR
IT BECAME MANIFEST THAT CHARLES HAD NO INTENTION OF OBSERVING THE COMPACT INTO WHICH HE HAD ENTERED THE SUPPLY GIVEN BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE NATION WAS COLLECTED
AND ABUSES WHICH WERE IN STRICT CONFORMITY WITH THE LAW AND WHICH HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY THE SWORD GAVE GENERAL SATISFACTION
THE GREAT LEADEN WEIGHT RAN DOWN TO THE FLOOR BUMP AND THEN THE CLOCK ALSO STOOD STILL BUT THE POOR MOTHER RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND CRIED ALOUD FOR HER CHILD
THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FIRST MAGISTRATE AND NO HOUSE OF LORDS BUT THIS STATE OF THINGS COULD NOT LAST ON THE
THE MAN LAUGHED YOU SEE SHE SAID YOU DO NOT GIVE HIM A FAIR CHANCE HE CANNOT USE ALL HIS POWER WITH HIS HEAD HELD BACK AS IT IS WITH THAT CHECK REIN
NOW I WAS GOING TO DIE I HEARD A SORT OF CONFUSION ROUND ME LOUD ANGRY VOICES AND THE GETTING DOWN OF THE LUGGAGE BUT IT WAS ALL LIKE A DREAM I THOUGHT I HEARD THAT SWEET PITIFUL VOICE SAYING
HERE I WAS PUT INTO A WELL LITTERED STALL AND SOME WARM GRUEL WAS BROUGHT TO ME WHICH I DRANK THANKFULLY IN THE EVENING
HE CALLED ME OLD CRONY AS I USED TO COME TO HIM IN THE FIELD AND FOLLOW HIM ABOUT SOMETIMES HE BROUGHT HIS GRANDFATHER WHO ALWAYS LOOKED CLOSELY AT MY LEGS THIS IS OUR POINT WILLIE
HE DROVE OUT OF THE STATION THE LOAD WAS VERY HEAVY AND I HAD HAD NEITHER FOOD NOR REST SINCE MORNING
SO MY DRIVER PULLED UP AT THE BACK OF SOME OF THE OUTSIDE CABS TO TAKE THE CHANCE OF A RETURN FARE IT WAS A VERY HEAVY TRAIN AND AS ALL THE CABS WERE SOON ENGAGED OURS WAS CALLED FOR
AND THE ROAD IS VERY STEEP I AM SURE HE IS DOING HIS BEST IF DOING HIS BEST WON'T GET THIS LOAD UP HE MUST DO SOMETHING MORE THAN HIS BEST THAT'S ALL I KNOW MA'AM SAID JAKES
BUT HERE THERE WAS NO REST AND MY DRIVER WAS JUST AS HARD AS HIS MASTER HE HAD A CRUEL WHIP WITH SOMETHING SO SHARP AT THE END THAT IT SOMETIMES DREW BLOOD
I FOUND THE WORK TELLING VERY MUCH ON MY STRENGTH ONE DAY I WAS LOADED MORE THAN USUAL AND PART OF THE ROAD WAS A STEEP UPHILL I USED ALL MY STRENGTH
I WILL NEVER SAY I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED FOR I WAS I STOPPED STILL AND I BELIEVE I TREMBLED OF COURSE I DID NOT TURN ROUND OR RUN AWAY I WAS NOT BROUGHT UP TO THAT JOHN JUMPED OUT
BLESS THE BOY HE IS AS HORSEY AS HIS OLD GRANDFATHER BUT DO LOOK AT HIS MOUTH GRANDPAPA AND ASK THE PRICE I AM SURE HE WOULD GROW YOUNG IN OUR MEADOWS
THOSE LINSEED MASHES WERE DELICIOUS AND I BEGAN TO THINK AFTER ALL
MY LEGS WERE NOT STIFF NOW AND I DID THE WORK WITH PERFECT EASE HE'S GROWING YOUNG WILLIE WE MUST GIVE HIM A LITTLE GENTLE WORK NOW AND BY MID SUMMER HE WILL BE AS GOOD AS LADYBIRD HE HAS A
THESE MEETINGS WERE CARRIED ON WITH THE GREATEST SECRECY ONE AFTERNOON HIS MOTHER CAME HOME FROM A MORNING VISIT TO THOMASIN
CHAPTER TWO TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH EDUCATION AND BOARD FOR THE NEXT EIGHT OR TEN MONTHS OLIVER WAS THE VICTIM OF A SYSTEMATIC COURSE OF TREACHERY AND DECEPTION
I THINK YOU WILL SAID MISSUS MANN WHO HAD NOTICED THE TONE OF THE REFUSAL AND THE GESTURE THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED IT JUST A LEETLE DROP WITH A LITTLE COLD WATER AND A LUMP OF SUGAR MISTER BUMBLE COUGHED
HERE SHE SET DOWN THE GLASS I SHALL TAKE A EARLY OPPORTUNITY OF MENTIONING IT TO THE BOARD MISSUS MANN HE DREW IT TOWARDS HIM YOU FEEL AS A MOTHER MISSUS MANN HE STIRRED THE GIN AND WATER I
THAT IT WAS YOU A COMING REPLIED MISSUS MANN WITH GREAT HUMILITY MISTER BUMBLE HAD A GREAT IDEA OF HIS ORATORICAL POWERS AND HIS IMPORTANCE HE HAD DISPLAYED THE ONE AND VINDICATED THE OTHER HE RELAXED
THEY STOOD STILL AND PREPARED TO BID EACH OTHER FAREWELL EVERYTHING BEFORE THEM WAS ON A PERFECT LEVEL THE SUN RESTING ON THE HORIZON LINE STREAMED ACROSS THE GROUND FROM BETWEEN COPPER COLOURED AND LILAC CLOUDS
A CERTAIN GLAD AND VOLUPTUOUS AIR OF TRIUMPH PERVADING HER EYES AT HAVING WON BY HER OWN UNAIDED SELF A MAN WHO WAS HER PERFECT COMPLEMENT IN ATTAINMENT APPEARANCE AND AGE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S PART
EVIDENTLY GRATIFIED WITH THE COMPLIMENT PERHAPS I MAY BE PERHAPS I MAY BE MISSUS MANN HE FINISHED THE GIN AND WATER AND ADDED OLIVER BEING NOW TOO OLD TO REMAIN HERE THE BOARD HAVE DETERMINED TO HAVE HIM BACK INTO THE HOUSE
QUITE ENOUGH TO OVERLOAD ITS STOMACH AND MAKE IT UNCOMFORTABLE THE ELDERLY FEMALE WAS A WOMAN OF WISDOM AND EXPERIENCE SHE KNEW WHAT WAS GOOD FOR CHILDREN AND SHE HAD A VERY ACCURATE PERCEPTION OF WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HERSELF
AND THEN BESTOWED UPON IT A KICK WHICH COULD HAVE EMANATED FROM NO LEG BUT A BEADLE'S LOR ONLY THINK SAID MISSUS MANN RUNNING OUT FOR THE THREE BOYS HAD BEEN REMOVED BY THIS TIME
IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY SYSTEM LEFT TO BE INVENTED THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT OUT AT THE UNIVERSITIES LONG BEFORE THIS TIME NEVER MOTHER THEY CANNOT FIND IT OUT BECAUSE THEIR TEACHERS DON'T COME IN CONTACT WITH THE CLASS WHICH DEMANDS SUCH A SYSTEM
THE AIR WAS WARM WITH A VAPOROUS WARMTH AND THE STILLNESS WAS UNBROKEN
YOUR MOTHER WILL INFLUENCE YOU TOO MUCH I SHALL NOT BE JUDGED FAIRLY
THE TWO CHILDREN BEGAN TO FEEL AFRAID AT REMAINING IN THAT LONESOME PLACE WHERE THE WATERS OF A RIVER
TAKE THIS TREASURE WHICH IS DESTINED FOR THEE ALONE BUT MIND AND TAKE CARE OF IT THEN THEY VANISHED AND CIENZO
BUT IF FOUR LOGS ARE NOT ENOW LET ME SPLIT FIVE AND TAKING UP A NEWLY GROUND AXE INSTEAD OF STRIKING THE WOOD HE STRUCK THE OGRESS ON THE NECK AND MADE HER FALL TO THE GROUND LIKE A PEAR THEN RUNNING QUICKLY TO THE GATE
SO TWO OF THE COURTIERS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THE DOG UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE TAVERN WHERE THEY FOUND CIENZO AND DELIVERING THE MESSAGE FROM THE KING THEY CONDUCTED HIM TO THE PALACE INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE KING
WHEN SUDDENLY SHE FOUND A THING TO AMAZE HER INSIDE THE FISH BEAUTIFUL FIELDS AND FINE GARDENS AND A SPLENDID MANSION WITH ALL THAT HEART COULD DESIRE IN WHICH SHE LIVED LIKE A PRINCESS THEN SHE WAS CARRIED QUICKLY BY THE FISH TO A ROCK
THAT ONE COULD NEVER SEE THE SUN THERE THIS OGRE HAD A MOST BEAUTIFUL HORSE WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT WERE FORMED WITH A PENCIL AND AMONGST OTHER WONDERFUL THINGS IT COULD SPEAK LIKE ANY MAN
I KISS THY DELICATE LITTLE HANDS FROM THE INN OF THE FLOWER POT SUNDAY HAVING WRITTEN THIS LETTER AND SEALED IT WITH A WAFER HE PLACED IT IN THE MOUTH OF THE ENCHANTED DOG SAYING
BREAK AND GLUE TOGETHER OF WHICH I WILL GIVE YOU ONE INSTANCE IN THE STORY THAT I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE SERVICE OF THE KING OF WIDE RIVER AN EXCELLENT YOUTH NAMED CORVETTO WHO FOR HIS GOOD CONDUCT

SINCE HE HAS HAD THE IMPUDENCE TO TELL YOU A BOUNCING LIE BUT TO PROVE TO YOU THAT I HAVE DONE THE DEED AND NOT THIS RASCAL ORDER THE HEADS TO BE PRODUCED NONE OF THEM CAN SPEAK TO THE PROOF WITHOUT A TONGUE AND THESE I HAVE BROUGHT WITH ME AS WITNESSES TO CONVINCE YOU OF THE TRUTH
SHOULD COME TO THE ROYAL PALACE AND HE WOULD THERE RECEIVE JOYFUL NEWS OF THEM JANNUCCIO WHO HAD ALL THIS TIME PASSED A SAD AND DISCONSOLATE LIFE BELIEVING THAT HIS CHILDREN HAD BEEN DEVOURED BY WOLVES
PROMISING TO SCORE IT UP WITH THE CHALK OF GRATITUDE AT THE TAVERN OF MEMORY SO CORVETTO INSTANTLY SET OUT HEELS OVER HEAD AND ARRIVING AT THE OGRE'S PALACE HE FOUND THAT THE OGRESS WHILST HER HUSBAND WAS GONE TO INVITE THE KINSFOLK
O LIQUID AND FREE AND TENDER O WILD AND LOOSE TO MY SOUL O WONDROUS SINGER YOU ONLY I HEAR YET THE STAR HOLDS ME BUT WILL SOON DEPART YET THE LILAC WITH MASTERING ODOR HOLDS ME FOURTEEN
SITTING BEFORE THE FIRE SIGHING AND GROANING AND FEELING VERY UNHAPPY HOW COULD I HAVE SWALLOWED IT SUCH A LARGE THING AS A PATTY PAN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND STARED MOURNFULLY AT THE GRATE
AND THE FIELDS ALL BUSY WITH LABOR AND THE INFINITE SEPARATE HOUSES HOW THEY ALL WENT ON EACH WITH ITS MEALS AND MINUTIA OF DAILY USAGES AND THE STREETS HOW THEIR THROBBINGS THROBB'D AND THE CITIES PENT
THE SONG THE WONDROUS CHANT OF THE GRAY BROWN BIRD

DUCHESS WENT HOME AND BRUSHED HER BEAUTIFUL BLACK COAT AND THEN SHE PICKED A BUNCH OF FLOWERS IN HER GARDEN AS A PRESENT FOR RIBBY AND PASSED THE TIME UNTIL THE CLOCK STRUCK FOUR
THERE WASN'T ANYTHING HE WOULDN'T DO FOR ME
HERE COFFIN THAT SLOWLY PASSES I GIVE YOU MY SPRIG OF LILAC SEVEN NOR FOR YOU FOR ONE ALONE BLOSSOMS AND BRANCHES GREEN TO COFFINS ALL I BRING
WITH ALL THE MOURNFUL VOICES OF THE DIRGES POUR'D AROUND THE COFFIN THE DIM LIT CHURCHES AND THE SHUDDERING ORGANS WHERE AMID THESE YOU JOURNEY
AS THAT POWERFUL PSALM IN THE NIGHT I HEARD FROM RECESSES PASSING I LEAVE THEE LILAC WITH HEART SHAPED LEAVES I LEAVE THEE THERE IN THE DOOR YARD BLOOMING RETURNING WITH SPRING I CEASE FROM MY SONG FOR THEE
THE VIOLET AND PURPLE MORN WITH JUST FELT BREEZES THE GENTLE SOFT BORN MEASURELESS LIGHT THE MIRACLE SPREADING BATHING ALL THE FULFILL'D NOON
THIS WON'T DO HENRIETTE NERVES WILL PROVE YOUR RUIN AND IF YOU CAN'T STAND YOUR LOSSES AT BRIDGE WHAT WILL YOU DO IN THE FACE OF THE GREATER CRISIS WHICH IN OUR PROFESSION IS LIKELY TO CONFRONT US IN THE SHAPE OF AN UNEXPECTED VISIT OF POLICE AT ANY MOMENT HER ANSWER WAS A RINGING LAUGH
NOTHING OF THE SORT BUNNY JUST DO AS I TELL YOU
AND IT HAS AFFECTED HER USUAL CALMNESS I MUST DO SOMETHING TO WARN HER AGAINST THIS MOMENTARY WEAKNESS
AND SHE GAVE HER LETTER TO THE POSTMAN BUT SHE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT RIBBY'S PIE
AS I SAY THERE WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS OF THIS LOOSE CHANGE AND I RECKON UP THE VALUE OF HIS STUDS GARTER RUBIES AND FINGER RINGS AT ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE OR A TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PULL IN ALL EH
WHEN WORD CAME OVER THE TELEPHONE TO DIGBY MISTER DE PELT'S VALET THAT MISTER DE PELT WAS AT THE ROCKERBILTS AND IN NO CONDITION TO GO HOME ALONE IT HAPPENED THAT IT WAS I WHO TOOK THE MESSAGE AND OBSERVING THAT DIGBY WAS ENGAGED IN A GAME OF BILLIARDS AND LIKELY TO REMAIN SO FOR SOME TIME TO COME
AND STAINED BY THE MIRE OF AN INDELIBLE DISHONOUR BUT FROM WHOSE STEADFAST AND CONSTANT HEART NO LURE OR PERIL OR THREAT OR DEGRADATION COULD EVER EFFACE THE IMAGE OF THAT VOLUPTUOUS LOVELINESS WHICH THE INSPIRED PENCIL OF LAFAYETTE HAS LIMNED FOR AGES YET TO COME
AND IN YOUR EAR MY FRIEND YOU WILL NOT THINK WHO MET US AS WE LEFT THE FIELD CONMEE HIMSELF HE WAS WALKING BY THE HEDGE READING I THINK A BREVIER BOOK WITH I DOUBT NOT A WITTY LETTER IN IT FROM GLYCERA OR CHLOE TO KEEP THE PAGE
SHE DARE NOT BEAR THE SUNNYGOLDEN BABE OF DAY NO LEOPOLD NAME AND MEMORY SOLACE THEE NOT THAT YOUTHFUL ILLUSION OF THY STRENGTH WAS TAKEN FROM THEE AND IN VAIN NO SON OF THY LOINS IS BY THEE
GIVING UPON THE FLOWERCLOSE WITH A FAINT SHADOW OF REMOTENESS OR OF REPROACH
DURING THE PAST FOUR MINUTES OR THEREABOUTS
MORE THAN THESE THE DARK EYES AND OLEAGINOUS ADDRESS BROUGHT HOME AT DUSKFALL MANY A COMMISSION TO THE HEAD OF THE FIRM SEATED WITH JACOB'S PIPE AFTER LIKE LABOURS IN THE PATERNAL INGLE A MEAL OF NOODLES YOU MAY BE SURE IS AHEATING
HIS OWN AND HIS ONLY ENJOYER FAR BE IT FROM CANDOUR TO VIOLATE THE BEDCHAMBER OF A RESPECTABLE LADY THE DAUGHTER OF A GALLANT MAJOR OR TO CAST THE MOST DISTANT REFLECTIONS UPON HER VIRTUE BUT IF HE CHALLENGES ATTENTION THERE AS IT WAS INDEED HIGHLY HIS INTEREST NOT TO HAVE DONE
THE INDIVIDUAL WHOSE VISUAL ORGANS WHILE THE ABOVE WAS GOING ON WERE AT THIS JUNCTURE COMMENCING TO EXHIBIT SYMPTOMS OF ANIMATION
TILL IN AN INSTANT A FLASH RIVES THEIR CENTRES AND WITH THE REVERBERATION OF THE THUNDER THE CLOUDBURST POURS ITS TORRENT SO AND NOT OTHERWISE WAS THE TRANSFORMATION VIOLENT AND INSTANTANEOUS UPON THE UTTERANCE OF THE WORD
FRANCIS WAS REMINDING STEPHEN OF YEARS BEFORE WHEN THEY HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL TOGETHER IN CONMEE'S TIME HE ASKED ABOUT GLAUCON ALCIBIADES PISISTRATUS WHERE WERE THEY NOW NEITHER KNEW
TIS SURE WHAT SAY IN THE SPEAKEASY TIGHT I SHEE YOU SHIR BANTAM TWO DAYS TEETEE BOWSING NOWT BUT CLARETWINE GARN HAVE A GLINT DO GUM I'M JIGGERED
AND MADE A CAPACIOUS HOLE IN IT BY POURING A LOT OF IT OUT WITH ALSO AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF ATTENTIVENESS IN ORDER NOT TO UPSET ANY OF THE BEER THAT WAS IN IT ABOUT THE PLACE
HIGH ANGLE FIRE INYAH SUNK BY WAR SPECIALS BE WORSE FOR HIM SAYS HE NOR ANY ROOSHIAN TIME ALL THERE'S ELEVEN OF THEM GET YE GONE FORWARD WOOZY WOBBLERS NIGHT NIGHT
WALKING ON A NIPPING MORNING FROM THE OLD HOUSE IN CLANBRASSIL STREET TO THE HIGH SCHOOL HIS BOOKSATCHEL ON HIM BANDOLIERWISE AND IN IT A GOODLY HUNK OF WHEATEN LOAF A MOTHER'S THOUGHT OR IT IS THE SAME FIGURE A YEAR OR SO GONE OVER IN HIS FIRST HARD HAT AH THAT WAS A DAY
USUALLY WELL FRINGED WITH SHRUBS AND TREES AND PRESENTING THE POLISHED SURFACES GIVEN THEM BY THE GLACIER THAT BROUGHT THEM INTO RELIEF ON THE UPPER PORTION OF THE BASIN BROAD MORAINE BEDS HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED AND ON THESE
IT WILL AMUSE ME TO LOOK ON SO THE RETAINERS WENT OUT AND BROUGHT IN THE IMPOSTOR BEFORE THEIR LORD
AND HIS MASTER GAVE HIM THE FOOD NEXT DOOR TO THIS GOOD OLD COUPLE THERE LIVED ANOTHER OLD MAN AND HIS WIFE WHO WERE BOTH WICKED AND CRUEL AND WHO HATED THEIR GOOD NEIGHBORS AND THE DOG SHIRO WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
THIS MADE HIM VERY ANGRY AND HE ORDERED HIS RETAINERS TO ARREST THE FALSE HANA SAKA JIJII AT ONCE AND PUT HIM IN PRISON FOR AN IMPOSTOR FROM THIS IMPRISONMENT THE WICKED OLD MAN WAS NEVER FREED
THERE MUST ALSO BE GOLD COINS UNDER MY TREE YOU MUST FIND THEM FOR ME WHERE ARE THEY WHERE WHERE AND CATCHING HOLD OF SHIRO'S NECK HE HELD THE DOG'S HEAD TO THE GROUND
CLAD IN GAUZY SUN SIFTED SPRAY HALF FALLING HALF FLOATING IT SEEMS INFINITELY GENTLE AND FINE BUT THE HYMNS IT SINGS
THE TOTAL DESCENT MADE BY THE STREAM FROM ITS HIGHEST SOURCES
WE PASS BETWEEN THE NORTH DOME AND HALF DOME AND IN LESS THAN AN HOUR COME TO MIRROR LAKE THE DOME CASCADE AND TENAYA FALL
INTO ANOTHER WORLD WHERE CLIMATE VEGETATION
PASSING THE CATHEDRAL WE DESCEND INTO THE DELIGHTFUL SPACIOUS TUOLUMNE VALLEY FROM WHICH EXCURSIONS MAY BE MADE TO MOUNTS DANA LYELL RITTER CONNESS AND MONO LAKE
THE BRIDAL VEIL SHOOTS FREE FROM THE UPPER EDGE OF THE CLIFF BY THE VELOCITY THE STREAM HAS ACQUIRED IN DESCENDING A LONG SLOPE ABOVE THE HEAD OF THE FALL LOOKING FROM THE TOP OF THE ROCK AVALANCHE TALUS ON THE WEST SIDE
IT IS ABOUT THREE MILES LONG WITH WALLS FIFTEEN HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND FEET HIGH CASCADES COMING OVER THEM
IT'S A TERRIBLY DIFFICULT AND ROUNDABOUT JOURNEY FROM THIS POINT INVOLVING A DAYBREAK START AND TWO TRAINS AND AN AUTOMOBILE BUT IF I'M TO BE AN AUTHORITY I MUST LIVE UP TO THE TITLE I'M KEEN ABOUT LOOKING OVER OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND GLEANING AS MANY IDEAS AS POSSIBLE AGAINST OUR OWN ALTERATIONS NEXT YEAR
DOCTOR MAC RAE BEING AT HAND AND IN A HUNGRY MOOD A RARE STATE FOR HIM
PLEASING VISIONS WERE ALSO BEING WOVEN AROUND PATTY'S PLACE THERE WAS A WARM PLEASANT SENSE OF HOME IN THE THOUGHT OF IT EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER LIVED THERE BUT THE SUMMER HAD BEEN A VERY HAPPY ONE TOO A TIME OF GLAD LIVING WITH SUMMER SUNS AND SKIES A TIME OF KEEN DELIGHT IN WHOLESOME THINGS
I SUPPOSE JUDGING FROM THE THEATERS THIS WINTER
AND I'D RATHER HAVE YOU THAN ANY ONE ELSE I ALWAYS LIKED YOU BEST OF ALL THE GIRLS I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH YOU WERE NEVER JEALOUS OR MEAN LIKE SOME OF THEM
BUT AS SHE WENT ON PILING UP DETAIL ON DETAIL EACH TRIVIAL IN ITSELF BUT MAKING A MOUNTAINOUS TOTAL I AGREED WITH HELEN THAT IT WAS AWFUL TO KEEP IT GOING IT WASN'T REALLY A MARRIAGE IT WAS A MISTAKE
PARTLY BECAUSE I WANTED TO JUSTIFY THEIR JUDGMENT PARTLY BECAUSE I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN GIVING THE POOR LITTLE KIDDIES THEIR SHARE OF HAPPINESS BUT MOSTLY I ACTUALLY BELIEVE
LEAVING HER PALE AND CHILDLIKE THE MOON ROSE IN THE SILVERY SKY EMPEARLING THE CLOUDS AROUND HER BELOW THE POND SHIMMERED IN ITS HAZY RADIANCE JUST BEYOND THE GILLIS HOMESTEAD WAS THE CHURCH WITH THE OLD GRAVEYARD BESIDE IT
WE ARE RUNNING ALONG HERE VERY MUCH AS USUAL WITHOUT ANYTHING EXCITING TO CHRONICLE YOU REMEMBER LITTLE MAYBELLE FULLER DON'T YOU THE CHORUS GIRL'S DAUGHTER WHOM OUR DOCTOR DOESN'T LIKE
AND DEEP WOMANHOOD JOYS MIGHT HAVE DONE FOR RUBY ANNE LOOKING DOWN THROUGH A MIST OF TEARS AT HER OLD PLAYFELLOW THOUGHT SHE SAW THE FACE GOD HAD MEANT RUBY TO HAVE AND REMEMBERED IT SO ALWAYS
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THERE WASN'T A WORD IN MY STORY ABOUT ABOUT ANNE CHOKED A LITTLE OVER THE WORD BAKING POWDER OH I PUT THAT IN SAID DIANA REASSURED
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD REVOLVE ETERNALLY BUT WE FINALLY GOT TOGETHER AND SHOOK HANDS AND SHE OBLIGINGLY HELPED ME CHOOSE FIFTEEN DOZEN PAIRS OF STOCKINGS AND FIFTY CAPS AND SWEATERS AND TWO HUNDRED UNION SUITS AND THEN WE GOSSIPED ALL THE WAY UP TO FIFTY SECOND STREET WHERE WE HAD LUNCHEON AT THE WOMEN'S UNIVERSITY CLUB
EVENING DO YOU REALIZE THAT I AM AN AUTHORITY ON THE CARE OF DEPENDENT CHILDREN TOMORROW I AND OTHER AUTHORITIES VISIT OFFICIALLY THE HEBREW SHELTERING GUARDIAN SOCIETY'S ORPHAN ASYLUM AT PLEASANTVILLE ALL THAT'S ITS NAME
I WANT TO KNOW YES I THINK SHE WILL SAID ANNE OH ANNE PROTESTED DIANA WITH A RATHER SHOCKED SMILE WELL WHY NOT DIANA ASKED ANNE SERIOUSLY DO YOU THINK WE'LL NEVER LAUGH IN HEAVEN OH I I DON'T KNOW FLOUNDERED DIANA
AND IT IS A TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE THE NEARNESS TO HUMANITY THAT AN ASYLUM BRINGS I AM LEARNING SO MANY NEW THINGS EVERY DAY THAT WHEN EACH SATURDAY NIGHT COMES I LOOK BACK ON THE SALLIE OF LAST SATURDAY NIGHT AMAZED AT HER IGNORANCE
ALWAYS CHATTERING AND WHISPERING OF HER BEAUX AND THEIR RIVALRIES AND DESPAIRS IT WAS THIS THAT MADE ANNE'S VISITS HARD FOR HER WHAT HAD ONCE BEEN SILLY OR AMUSING WAS GRUESOME NOW IT WAS DEATH PEERING THROUGH A WILFUL MASK OF LIFE
ARE THEY BOUND FOR A REFORMATORY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE NATURAL QUESTION AFTER OBSERVING THE TABLE MANNERS OF HER OFFSPRING MY LITTLE BAND TUMBLED IN TOWARD TEN O'CLOCK EXCITEDLY BABBLING A MESS OF STATISTICS ABOUT RECIPROCATING COMPOUND ENGINES AND WATERTIGHT BULKHEADS
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK IN OUR TRADE I REMEMBER A CASE OF FORGERY ONCE
OF COURSE SHE HAS GONE FOR HELP HAVEN'T YOU FOUND OUT LONG AGO THAT SHE IS THE RIGHT SORT WELL WHY DID SHE GO IN THE WRONG DIRECTION SOBBED JULIA EVERYBODY IS OVER ON THE OTHER BANK THERE IS NOTHING BUT AN ICE HOUSE OVER HERE YOU MAY TRUST TO HER TO HAVE HAD SOME GOOD SENSIBLE REASON RETORTED TOM LOYALLY
BUT THE GAME COULD NOT LAST FOREVER THAT WAS CERTAIN A MONTH OR TWO MORE AND BEVERLY WOULD HAVE TO THINK OF THE RETURN TO WASHINGTON HIS COURAGE HIS COOL IMPUDENCE HIS SUBTLE WIT CHARMED HER MORE THAN SHE COULD EXPRESS NOW SHE WAS BEGINNING TO STUDY HIM FROM A STANDPOINT PECULIARLY AND SELFISHLY HER OWN
GRACE SOON SAW HOWEVER THAT THE IDEA WAS NOT ENTIRELY IDIOTIC LATER SHE WAS TO OFFER UP A PRAYER OF THANKS FOR THAT SAME CHILD'S WAGON THE DEAF AND DUMB MAN WAS WEARING HEAVY ARCTIC RUBBERS WHICH KEPT HIM FROM SLIPPING WHILE GRACE WHOSE SOLES WERE AS SMOOTH AS GLASS
A HURT EXPRESSION CROSSED HIS FACE NO MISTER FOYLE HE DECLARED EARNESTLY I DON'T TAKE ANY INTEREST IN BOXING I JUST CALLED IN TO PUT YOU WISE TO SOMETHING AS I WAS PASSING THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU FREDDY WHAT WAS IT THE PICK POCKET DROPPED HIS VOICE IT'S ABOUT HARRY GOLDENBURG HE SAID
HOW CAN YOU EXPECT THE PARAGON TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU DEAR IF HE THINKS YOU ARE ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE YETIVE ASKED HER BLUE EYES BEAMING WITH THE FUN OF IT ALL POOH SNIFFED BEVERLY YOU HAVE ONLY TO CONSULT HISTORY TO FIND THE EXCUSE IT'S THE DEAR OLD HABIT OF MEN TO MAKE LOVE TO QUEENS AND GET BEHEADED FOR IT
FOR A WEEK OR MORE BEVERLY HAD BEEN BEHAVING TOWARD BALDOS IN THE MOST CAVALIER FASHION HER FRIENDS HAD BEEN TEASING HER AND TO HER OWN INTENSE AMAZEMENT SHE RESENTED IT THE FACT THAT SHE FELT THE STING OF THEIR SLY TAUNTS WAS SUFFICIENT TO AROUSE IN HER THE DISTRESSING CONVICTION
FOYLE MOTIONED FOR THE DOOR TO BE SHUT SO YOU'RE THE CAB DRIVER WE'RE LOOKING FOR ARE YOU HE SAID YOU'RE WILLIAM WHITE
TOM TOM GRAY SHE CALLED WHERE ARE YOU RUN FOR HELP CAME THE ANSWER IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE SAW THEM CLINGING TO A BROKEN LEDGE OF ICE TOM SUPPORTING JULIA CROSBY AS FOR THE JUNIOR CAPTAIN SHE WAS WEEPING BITTERLY AND MAKING NO ATTEMPT TO HELP HERSELF
SUPPOSE THERE IS NO ONE THERE SHE PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN RAN ON FASTER THAN BEFORE I SHALL FIND HELP OVER THERE I KNOW I SHALL SHE THOUGHT AS SHE HURRIED OVER THE FROZEN GROUND AND MADE STRAIGHT FOR THE ICE HOUSE THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST
GRACE'S MOTHER WAS JUSTLY HORRIFIED WHEN GRACE IN HER BEDRAGGLED CONDITION WALKED INTO THE LIVING ROOM SHE INSISTED ON PUTTING HER TO BED WRAPPING HER IN BLANKETS AND GIVING HER HOT DRINKS GRACE FELL INTO A SOUND SLEEP FROM WHICH SHE DID NOT AWAKEN UNTIL EVENING
WITH HIS HANDS THRUST DEEP IN HIS TROUSERS POCKETS SIR HILARY STRODE TO AND FRO ACROSS THE ROOM IT'S TIME WE GOT A BIT FORWARD HE SAID
HE'S NEVER BEEN MIXED UP IN ANY DIRTY BUSINESS AND AS HE'S CARRIED OUT ONE OR TWO POLITICAL MISSIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES I SUPPOSE HE'S HAD TO KNOW SOME OF THESE PEOPLE TO MORROW OR THE NEXT DAY I EXPECT TO HAVE THE RECORDS OF BOTH IVAN ABRAMOVITCH AND CONDIT IT WILL ALL HELP THOUGH THE BEARING ON THE MURDER IS PERHAPS INDIRECT
HAD LOVED HIM THESE TWO YEARS HAD LOVED HIM SINCE THE DAY OF THEIR FIRST MEETING AND THAT WAS JUST AS LONG AS HE HAD LOVED HER BUT HE HAD NEVER TOLD HIS LOVE THERE IS A CODE OF HONOUR RIGHT OR WRONG
CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARMS JUST ABOVE THE ELBOW SHOOK HIM ANGRILY AS ONE SHAKES A NAUGHTY CHILD LOOKED HIM ONCE IN THE EYES AND BURIED HER FACE IN HIS NECK SOBBING LONG DRY BREATHLESS SOBS EVEN THEN HE TRIED TO BE STRONG
TO GET WHAT INFORMATION HE COULD FROM BRAND WHITLOCK THE AMERICAN MINISTER IN BELGIUM HE WENT AT ONCE TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES BUT THEY EVADED HIS QUESTIONS AND WAITED TEN DAYS BEFORE GIVING HIM A REPLY THEN THE GERMANS SENT HIM A STATEMENT
HE DROVE HIS PASSION ON THE CURB AND MASTERED IT YET THE QUESTIONS DOES SHE LOVE ME DOES SHE KNOW I LOVE HER DOES SHE WONDER WHY I DON'T SPEAK AND THE COUNTER QUESTIONS WILL SHE THINK I DON'T CARE
WHEN WE LET OUR EMOTIONS PLAY THE PRIMITIVE GAMES WITH US BUT ALWAYS THE MORNING BROUGHT STRENGTH TO KEEP TO HIS RESOLUTION HE SAW HER THREE TIMES A YEAR WHEN CHRISTMAS EASTER AND MIDSUMMER BROUGHT HER TO STAY WITH AN AUNT BROUGHT HIM HOME TO HIS PEOPLE FOR HOLIDAYS
AND PULLED HIMSELF UP TILL HIS KNEE WAS ON THE MOULDING OF THE ARCH SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED ANYONE WHO HAD TOLD HER THAT ONLY TWO MINUTES HAD BEEN LIVED BETWEEN THE MOMENT OF HIS STUMBLE AND THE OTHER MOMENT WHEN HIS FOOT TOUCHED THE GRASS
ONLY TO LEARN LATER THAT IT HAD INDEED BEEN DECLARED AND THAT MISS CAVELL WOULD FACE A FIRING SQUAD AT TWO O'CLOCK THE FOLLOWING MORNING MISTER WHITLOCK THEN URGED BARON VON DER LANCKEN
EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH HER EYES BANDAGED MISS CAVELL WAS LED OUT TO FACE THE RIFLES OF THE HUNS SHE WORE AN ENGLISH FLAG OVER HER BOSOM ONLY GERMANS WERE WITNESSES OF THE EXECUTION BUT THE GERMAN CHAPLAIN WHO ATTENDED SAID THAT SHE DIED LIKE A HEROINE
THEY SHINE LIKE GOLD SHE SAID
ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST FIFTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN WE ARE TOLD MISS CAVELL WAS TYING UP THE WOUNDS OF A WOUNDED GERMAN SOLDIER WHEN A GROUP OF ARMED MEN ENTERED THE ROOM AND THEIR LEADER TOLD HER ROUGHLY THAT SHE WAS UNDER ARREST
AND GRADUALLY LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHOLE WORTH OF LIFE SEEMED TO LIE IN THE FAINT FAR CHANCE OF HIS BEING ABLE TO UNDO THE ONE TRIUMPHANTLY IMPULSIVE AND UNREASONING ACTION OF HIS LIFE
BUT I DON'T SEE HOW TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IT REALLY IS RATHER AMUSING THAT I I SHOULD HAVE TO TAP HIS BEASTLY CHEST AND LISTEN TO HIS CURSED LUNGS AND ASK SYMPATHETIC QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS IDIOTIC INFANT ILLNESSES
WHAT WOULD IT MATTER THOUGHT HE LOOKING AT AN OFFICER WHO WAS ENTERING THE HOUSE THE EMPEROR OCCUPIED AFTER ALL PEOPLE DO GO IN
WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES DOLOKHOV EMBRACED PIERRE AND KISSED HIM BORIS SAID A FEW WORDS TO HIS GENERAL AND COUNT BENNIGSEN TURNED TO PIERRE AND PROPOSED THAT HE SHOULD RIDE WITH HIM ALONG THE LINE
SAID TO PIERRE AS THOUGH CONTINUING AN INTERRUPTED CONVERSATION THE MILITIA HAVE PUT ON CLEAN WHITE SHIRTS TO BE READY TO DIE WHAT HEROISM COUNT
IN ALL ITS OLD FORCE IN THE UNIFORM OF THE PREOBRAZHENSK REGIMENT WHITE CHAMOIS LEATHER BREECHES AND HIGH BOOTS AND WEARING A STAR ROSTOV DID NOT KNOW IT WAS THAT OF THE LEGION D'HONNEUR
TO PIERRE THAT SMILE SAID PLAINLY I AM WELL
ACCOMPANIED BY THE THRONG PIERRE STOPPED SOME THIRTY PACES FROM KUTUZOV TALKING TO BORIS HE EXPLAINED HIS WISH TO BE PRESENT AT THE BATTLE AND TO SEE THE POSITION
WAS OCCUPIED BY THE DIFFERENT EXPRESSION HE SAW ON OTHER FACES AN EXPRESSION THAT SPOKE NOT OF PERSONAL MATTERS BUT OF THE UNIVERSAL QUESTIONS OF LIFE AND DEATH
THE THOUGHT OF MEETING THE EMPEROR AT ANY MOMENT WAS SO FASCINATING AND CONSEQUENTLY SO ALARMING THAT HE WAS READY TO RUN AWAY BUT THE OFFICIAL WHO HAD QUESTIONED HIM OPENED THE DOOR AND ROSTOV ENTERED
I COULD FORGIVE HER I CAN'T BUT CAN THIS BE COMPARED SAID PIERRE PRINCE ANDREW INTERRUPTED HIM AND CRIED SHARPLY YES ASK HER HAND AGAIN BE MAGNANIMOUS AND SO ON
BUT I MAINTAIN THAT IF ANYTHING GOOD HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN THIS REIGN IT WAS DONE BY HIM BY HIM ALONE HE PAUSED AT THE SIGHT OF PIERRE HIS FACE QUIVERED
AN OLD CROSS LOOKING FOOTMAN CAME AND ANNOUNCED TO THE ROSTOVS THAT THE PRINCE WAS NOT RECEIVING BUT THAT THE PRINCESS BEGGED THEM TO WALK UP
HALF IN JEST HALF IN EARNEST BUT NATASHA NOTICED THAT HER FATHER WAS FLURRIED ON ENTERING THE ANTEROOM AND INQUIRED TIMIDLY AND SOFTLY
THAT SHE WAS NOT AFRAID OF ANYBODY THE PRINCESS TOLD THE COUNT THAT SHE WOULD BE DELIGHTED AND ONLY BEGGED HIM TO STAY LONGER AT ANNA SEMENOVNA'S AND HE DEPARTED
BUT I DON'T KNOW SAID PIERRE WELL IT DOESN'T MATTER SAID PRINCE ANDREW TELL COUNTESS ROSTOVA THAT SHE WAS AND IS PERFECTLY FREE
BUT I WAS BAFFLED IN EVERY ATTEMPT I MADE FOR THIS PURPOSE
NO DISTINCT IDEAS OCCUPIED MY MIND ALL WAS CONFUSED I FELT LIGHT AND HUNGER AND THIRST AND DARKNESS INNUMERABLE SOUNDS RANG IN MY EARS AND ON ALL SIDES VARIOUS SCENTS SALUTED ME
GREATLY ALTERED THE ASPECT OF THE EARTH MEN WHO BEFORE THIS CHANGE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN HID IN CAVES DISPERSED THEMSELVES AND WERE EMPLOYED IN VARIOUS ARTS OF CULTIVATION
WAS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND BENT EVERY FACULTY TOWARDS THAT PURPOSE BUT FOUND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THE NEXT MORNING FELIX WENT OUT TO HIS WORK
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE ADDRESSED THE OLD MAN I COULD MENTION INNUMERABLE INSTANCES WHICH ALTHOUGH SLIGHT
HOW THE FATHER DOTED ON THE SMILES OF THE INFANT
THE MOON HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE NIGHT AND AGAIN WITH A LESSENED FORM SHOWED ITSELF WHILE I STILL REMAINED IN THE FOREST MY SENSATIONS HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME DISTINCT AND MY MIND RECEIVED EVERY DAY ADDITIONAL IDEAS
HAPPY HAPPY EARTH FIT HABITATION FOR GODS WHICH SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE
BY DEGREES I REMEMBER A STRONGER LIGHT PRESSED UPON MY NERVES SO THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SHUT MY EYES DARKNESS THEN CAME OVER ME AND TROUBLED ME BUT HARDLY HAD I FELT THIS WHEN BY OPENING MY EYES AS I NOW SUPPOSE
MY DAYS WERE SPENT IN CLOSE ATTENTION THAT I MIGHT MORE SPEEDILY MASTER THE LANGUAGE AND I MAY BOAST
AND ONCE OR TWICE I HEARD THEM ON THESE OCCASIONS UTTER THE WORDS GOOD SPIRIT WONDERFUL
AND TASTED MUCH MORE SAVOURY THAN THE BERRIES I GATHERED FROM THE TREES I TRIED THEREFORE TO DRESS MY FOOD IN THE SAME MANNER PLACING IT ON THE LIVE EMBERS
SHE APPEARED AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT FEELINGS WIPING A FEW TEARS FROM HER LOVELY EYES
ON HEARING THIS WORD FELIX CAME UP HASTILY TO THE LADY WHO WHEN SHE SAW HIM THREW UP HER VEIL
IT WAS LESS STRANGE THAT I AN IMPERFECT AND SOLITARY BEING SHOULD BE WRETCHED YET WHY WERE THESE GENTLE BEINGS UNHAPPY
WITH A PAIL ON HER HEAD PASSING BEFORE MY HOVEL THE GIRL WAS YOUNG AND OF GENTLE DEMEANOUR
I ABSTAINED AND SATISFIED MYSELF WITH BERRIES NUTS AND ROOTS WHICH I GATHERED FROM A NEIGHBOURING WOOD
AND WHAT WAS I OF MY CREATION AND CREATOR I WAS ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT BUT I KNEW THAT I POSSESSED NO MONEY NO FRIENDS NO KIND OF PROPERTY
FOR AN INSTANT I DARED TO SHAKE OFF MY CHAINS AND LOOK AROUND ME WITH A FREE AND LOFTY SPIRIT BUT THE IRON HAD EATEN INTO MY FLESH AND I SANK AGAIN TREMBLING AND HOPELESS INTO MY MISERABLE SELF
AND TREMBLING WITH PASSION TORE TO PIECES THE THING ON WHICH I WAS ENGAGED THE WRETCH SAW ME DESTROY THE CREATURE ON WHOSE FUTURE EXISTENCE HE DEPENDED FOR HAPPINESS AND WITH A HOWL OF DEVILISH DESPAIR AND REVENGE
THE SIGHT OF WHAT IS BEAUTIFUL IN NATURE OR THE STUDY OF WHAT IS EXCELLENT AND SUBLIME IN THE PRODUCTIONS OF MAN COULD ALWAYS INTEREST MY HEART AND COMMUNICATE ELASTICITY TO MY SPIRITS BUT I AM A BLASTED TREE
BUT A BLIGHT HAD COME OVER MY EXISTENCE AND I ONLY VISITED THESE PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE INFORMATION THEY MIGHT GIVE ME ON THE SUBJECT IN WHICH MY INTEREST WAS SO TERRIBLY PROFOUND COMPANY WAS IRKSOME TO ME
AND QUICKLY AVAILED MYSELF OF THE LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION THAT I HAD BROUGHT WITH ME ADDRESSED TO THE MOST DISTINGUISHED NATURAL PHILOSOPHERS IF THIS JOURNEY HAD TAKEN PLACE DURING MY DAYS OF STUDY AND HAPPINESS IT WOULD HAVE AFFORDED ME INEXPRESSIBLE PLEASURE
WHERE THE CURIOSITIES ARE DISPOSED IN THE SAME MANNER AS IN THE COLLECTIONS AT SERVOX AND CHAMOUNIX THE LATTER NAME MADE ME TREMBLE WHEN PRONOUNCED BY HENRY AND I HASTENED TO QUIT MATLOCK WITH WHICH THAT TERRIBLE SCENE WAS THUS ASSOCIATED
THAT EVEN NOW WHEN THE SCENE IS ON THE POINT OF CLOSING BEFORE ME FOREVER I SHUDDER TO REFLECT ON IT SOME HOURS PASSED THUS BUT BY DEGREES AS THE SUN DECLINED TOWARDS THE HORIZON
THE REMAINS OF THE HALF FINISHED CREATURE WHOM I HAD DESTROYED
WHY DO YOU ANSWER ME SO ROUGHLY I REPLIED SURELY IT IS NOT THE CUSTOM OF ENGLISHMEN TO RECEIVE STRANGERS SO INHOSPITABLY I DO NOT KNOW SAID THE MAN
MY MIND WAS INTENTLY FIXED ON THE CONSUMMATION OF MY LABOUR AND MY EYES WERE SHUT TO THE HORROR OF MY PROCEEDINGS
AFTER PASSING SOME MONTHS IN LONDON WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM A PERSON IN SCOTLAND WHO HAD FORMERLY BEEN OUR VISITOR AT GENEVA HE MENTIONED THE BEAUTIES OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY
AND THE GREEN HILLS WANT THE CROWN OF DISTANT WHITE ALPS WHICH ALWAYS ATTEND ON THE PINY MOUNTAINS OF MY NATIVE COUNTRY WE VISITED THE WONDROUS CAVE AND THE LITTLE CABINETS OF NATURAL HISTORY
AND I BANISHED FROM MY MIND EVERY THOUGHT THAT COULD LEAD TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION BETWEEN TWO AND THREE IN THE MORNING THE MOON ROSE AND I THEN PUTTING MY BASKET ABOARD A LITTLE SKIFF
SO WE HUMOURED HIS PARTIALITY
AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE REGULARLY GRUMBLED
ISABEL DELAYED FOR SOME MINUTES TO GO TO HIM SHE MOVED ABOUT THE ROOM WITH A NEW SENSE OF COMPLICATIONS BUT AT LAST SHE PRESENTED HERSELF AND FOUND HIM STANDING NEAR THE LAMP HE WAS TALL STRONG AND SOMEWHAT STIFF
SAID MILDRED THE YOUNGER SISTER AT THE SAME TIME WARBURTON'S VERY REASONABLE MISS MOLYNEUX OBSERVED
EDMUND LUDLOW WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ANSWER IN AN EXTREMELY AUDIBLE TONE
DO YOU THINK HE WOULD STAND THE TEST THE TEST I
A CANDID NATURAL COUNTENANCE A CAPACIOUS APPETITE AND A TENDENCY TO INDISCRIMINATE LAUGHTER
HEATHCLIFF HE'S DEAD AND THEY BOTH SET UP A HEART BREAKING CRY
MIGHT WATCH A FREE GREYHOUND I WANT TO SEE HER SAFELY MARRIED THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE SHE FREQUENTLY NOTED TO HER HUSBAND WELL I MUST SAY I SHOULD HAVE NO PARTICULAR DESIRE TO MARRY HER
WHO EXACTLY RESEMBLED THEM DEPRIVED OF THIS ADVANTAGE HOWEVER ISABEL'S VISITORS RETAINED THAT OF AN EXTREME SWEETNESS AND SHYNESS OF DEMEANOUR AND OF HAVING AS SHE THOUGHT
SHE WAS IN THE MOOD FOR LIKING EVERYTHING
TURNING JOSEPH'S RELIGIOUS CURSES INTO RIDICULE BAITING ME AND DOING JUST WHAT HER FATHER HATED MOST SHOWING HOW HER PRETENDED INSOLENCE WHICH HE THOUGHT REAL HAD MORE POWER OVER HEATHCLIFF THAN HIS KINDNESS
HE DIED QUIETLY IN HIS CHAIR ONE OCTOBER EVENING SEATED BY THE FIRE SIDE
BUT IT WAS NOT WITH A DESIRE FOR DOZING FORGETFULNESS
THERE HAD REALLY BEEN A CHANGE IN HER LIFE
AND IF HE HAD BEEN TROUBLED ABOUT MONEY MATTERS NOTHING EVER DISTURBED THEIR IRREFLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MANY POSSESSIONS
OF THEIR OPINIONS ISABEL WAS NEVER VERY DEFINITELY INFORMED
SHE HAD OFTEN REMARKED IN SPITE OF WHICH HOWEVER SHE HELD HER RATHER WISTFULLY IN SIGHT
THE LAST OBSERVATION I REMARKED WAS MADE ON THE ISLAND WHEN THE GEYSER WAS YOU MEAN AXEL ISLAND DON'T DECLINE THE HONOUR OF HAVING GIVEN YOUR NAME TO THE FIRST ISLAND EVER DISCOVERED IN THE CENTRAL PARTS OF THE GLOBE WELL SAID I
A SAIL ALREADY HUNG FROM THE NEW MAST AND THE WIND WAS PLAYING IN ITS WAVING FOLDS THE PROFESSOR SAID A FEW WORDS TO THE GUIDE AND IMMEDIATELY HE PUT EVERYTHING ON BOARD AND ARRANGED EVERY NECESSARY FOR OUR DEPARTURE
AND FINGER AND TOE NAILS OF FRIGHTFUL LENGTH THIS DESICCATED MUMMY STARTLED US BY APPEARING JUST AS IT HAD LIVED COUNTLESS AGES AGO I STOOD MUTE BEFORE THIS APPARITION OF REMOTE ANTIQUITY MY UNCLE USUALLY SO GARRULOUS
I AM ONLY A LITTLE KNOCKED UP BUT I SHALL SOON BE BETTER OH SAYS MY UNCLE THAT'S NOTHING TO SIGNIFY YOU ARE ONLY A LITTLE BIT TIRED BUT YOU UNCLE YOU SEEM IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS THIS MORNING
SUCH HIGH SPIRITS AS THESE WERE RATHER TOO STRONG BUT WHERE IS THE COMPASS I ASKED HERE IT IS UPON THIS ROCK IN PERFECT CONDITION AS WELL AS THE THERMOMETERS AND THE CHRONOMETER THE HUNTER IS A SPLENDID FELLOW
BUT OBJECTS BEARING THE TRACES OF HIS HANDIWORK SUCH AS FOSSIL LEG BONES OF ANIMALS SCULPTURED AND CARVED EVIDENTLY BY THE HAND OF MAN
HIS MOUTH GAPING WIDE HIS EYES FLASHING BEHIND HIS SHINING SPECTACLES HIS HEAD BALANCING WITH AN UP AND DOWN MOTION HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE DENOTED UNLIMITED ASTONISHMENT HERE HE STOOD FACING AN IMMENSE COLLECTION OF SCATTERED
HE COULD GET NO FURTHER
THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE FOOT OF THE CLIFFS WAS CONSIDERABLE IT TOOK HALF AN HOUR TO BRING US TO THE WALL OF ROCK WE TRAMPLED UNDER OUR FEET NUMBERLESS SHELLS OF ALL THE FORMS AND SIZES WHICH EXISTED IN THE EARLIEST AGES OF THE WORLD
I DON'T THINK WE SHALL COME OUT BY THE WAY THAT WE WENT IN I STARED AT THE PROFESSOR WITH A GOOD DEAL OF MISTRUST I ASKED WAS HE NOT TOUCHED IN THE BRAIN AND YET THERE WAS METHOD IN HIS MADNESS AND NOW LET US GO TO BREAKFAST SAID HE
YOU SEE HE SAID THAT IT IS NOT SIX FEET LONG AND THAT WE ARE STILL SEPARATED BY A LONG INTERVAL FROM THE PRETENDED RACE OF GIANTS
NOR WAS THIS ALL FRESH DISCOVERIES OF REMAINS IN THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION HAD EMBOLDENED OTHER GEOLOGISTS TO REFER BACK THE HUMAN SPECIES TO A HIGHER ANTIQUITY STILL IT IS TRUE THAT THESE REMAINS WERE NOT HUMAN BONES
HAZE THERE WITHIN THREE SQUARE MILES WERE ACCUMULATED THE MATERIALS FOR A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL LIFE OF AGES A HISTORY SCARCELY OUTLINED IN THE TOO RECENT STRATA OF THE INHABITED WORLD
