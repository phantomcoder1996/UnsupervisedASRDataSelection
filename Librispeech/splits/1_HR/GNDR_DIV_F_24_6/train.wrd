MARIA'S INTELLIGENCE CONCLUDED WITH A TENDER EFFUSION OF PITY FOR HER SISTER ANNE
DO YOU THAT'S HONEST BY HEAVENS I AM GLAD YOU ARE NO ENEMY TO MATRIMONY HOWEVER DID YOU EVER HEAR THE OLD SONG GOING TO ONE WEDDING BRINGS ON ANOTHER
DECLARED HE HAD NEVER SEEN TWO MEN SO MUCH ALIKE IN HIS LIFE AND WOULD HARDLY GIVE UP THE POINT OF ITS HAVING BEEN TILNEY HIMSELF THEIR DRIVE EVEN WHEN THIS SUBJECT WAS OVER WAS NOT LIKELY TO BE VERY AGREEABLE
MAKE YOURSELF EASY THERE IS NO DANGER OF THAT FOR I HEARD TILNEY HALLOOING TO A MAN WHO WAS JUST PASSING BY ON HORSEBACK THAT THEY WERE GOING AS FAR AS WICK ROCKS THEN I WILL SHALL I GO MISSUS ALLEN
DIVIDED BETWEEN REGRET FOR THE LOSS OF ONE GREAT PLEASURE AND THE HOPE OF SOON ENJOYING ANOTHER ALMOST ITS EQUAL IN DEGREE HOWEVER UNLIKE IN KIND SHE COULD NOT THINK THE TILNEYS HAD ACTED QUITE WELL BY HER
WITH THE NATURAL BLUSH OF SO NEW AN EMOTION SHE CRIED OUT GOOD HEAVEN MY DEAR ISABELLA WHAT DO YOU MEAN CAN YOU CAN YOU REALLY BE IN LOVE WITH JAMES THIS BOLD SURMISE HOWEVER SHE SOON LEARNT COMPREHENDED BUT HALF THE FACT
IN SO READILY GIVING UP THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITHOUT SENDING HER ANY MESSAGE OF EXCUSE IT WAS NOW BUT AN HOUR LATER THAN THE TIME FIXED ON FOR THE BEGINNING OF THEIR WALK AND IN SPITE OF WHAT SHE HAD HEARD OF THE PRODIGIOUS ACCUMULATION OF DIRT IN THE COURSE OF THAT HOUR
MADE HIS FRIEND PULL UP TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE MATTER THE OTHERS THEN CAME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR CONVERSATION AND MORLAND SAID WE HAD BETTER GO BACK THORPE IT IS TOO LATE TO GO ON TODAY
BUT THE TILNEYS WERE ENTIRELY TO BLAME WHY WERE NOT THEY MORE PUNCTUAL IT WAS DIRTY INDEED BUT WHAT DID THAT SIGNIFY I AM SURE JOHN AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE MINDED IT I NEVER MIND GOING THROUGH ANYTHING WHERE A FRIEND IS CONCERNED THAT IS MY DISPOSITION
THE CLOCK STRUCK TWELVE AND IT STILL RAINED YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GO MY DEAR I DO NOT QUITE DESPAIR YET I SHALL NOT GIVE IT UP TILL A QUARTER AFTER TWELVE
THE ANXIOUS AFFECTION WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSED OF HAVING CONTINUALLY WATCHED IN ISABELLA'S EVERY LOOK AND ACTION HAD IN THE COURSE OF THEIR YESTERDAY'S PARTY RECEIVED THE DELIGHTFUL CONFESSION OF AN EQUAL LOVE HER HEART AND FAITH WERE ALIKE ENGAGED TO JAMES
MY NOTION OF THINGS IS SIMPLE ENOUGH LET ME ONLY HAVE THE GIRL I LIKE SAY I WITH A COMFORTABLE HOUSE OVER MY HEAD AND WHAT CARE I FOR ALL THE REST FORTUNE IS NOTHING I AM SURE OF A GOOD INCOME OF MY OWN
SO HERE ARE MY BLACK HAIR AND MY BLACK EYES WHOSE LASHES ACT ACCORDING TO YOU LIKE VENETIAN BLINDS MY COMMANDING AIR AND MY WHOLE PERSON RAISED TO THE RANK OF SOVEREIGN POWER TEN YEARS HENCE DEAR
ONLY A SIMPLE COUNTRY HOUSE STANDING BENEATH ONE OF OUR HILLS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THAT NOBLE VALLEY THE PRIDE OF WHICH IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE CASTLE OF MAUCOMBE THE BUILDING IS QUITE UNPRETENTIOUS FOUR PEBBLE WALLS COVERED WITH A YELLOWISH WASH
ON THE OTHER HAND MARRIAGE WILL REMAIN WHEN PLEASURES HAVE VANISHED AND IT IS THE SOURCE OF INTERESTS FAR MORE PRECIOUS THAN THOSE OF THE MAN AND WOMAN ENTERING ON THE ALLIANCE MIGHT IT NOT THEREFORE BE THAT THE ONLY REQUISITE FOR A HAPPY MARRIAGE WAS FRIENDSHIP
WHICH MY CHILDISH EYES USED TO SEE WITHOUT COMPREHENDING A FORTNIGHT AFTER MY ARRIVAL MY FATHER AND MOTHER TOOK ME ALONG WITH MY TWO BROTHERS TO DINE WITH ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS
WITH MAGIC TOUCH I HAVE EFFACED THE VERY MEMORY OF HIS SUFFERINGS IT IS A COMPLETE METAMORPHOSIS LOUIS IS REALLY VERY ATTRACTIVE NOW FEELING SURE OF MY AFFECTION HE THROWS OFF HIS RESERVE AND DISPLAYS UNSUSPECTED GIFTS
LEAVE ME ABSOLUTELY FREE I WOULD PUT NO HINDRANCE IN THE WAY OF YOUR INSPIRING ME WITH A LOVE SIMILAR TO YOUR OWN BUT I AM DETERMINED TO BE YOURS ONLY OF MY OWN FREE GIFT CREATE IN ME THE WISH TO GIVE UP MY FREEDOM
WHEN A MAN AND WOMAN IN PERFECT TRUST AND MUTUAL KNOWLEDGE HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF GIVING VARIETY TO THE INFINITE THIS IS THE TASK SET BEFORE EVERY TRUE WIFE THE ANSWER BEGINS TO DAWN ON ME AND I SHALL NOT REST TILL I HAVE MADE IT MINE
WAS A FIRST MEETING BETWEEN YOUR SWEETHEART AND THE EXILE THE COMTE DE MAUCOMBE'S SERVANTS DONNED THEIR OLD LACED LIVERIES AND HATS THE COACHMAN HIS GREAT TOP BOOTS
OCTOBER HOW DEEPLY YOUR LETTER MOVED ME ABOVE ALL WHEN I COMPARE OUR WIDELY DIFFERENT DESTINIES HOW BRILLIANT IS THE WORLD YOU ARE ENTERING HOW PEACEFUL THE RETREAT WHERE I SHALL END MY MODEST CAREER
IN THE NEXT PLACE HE SHARES OUR VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT OF MY BEAUTY AND IT IS CRUEL FOR HIM TO SEE HOW THE HARDSHIPS OF HIS LIFE HAVE ROBBED HIM OF YOUTH FINALLY HE FELT THE SUPERIORITY OF MY WOMANHOOD OVER HIS MANHOOD
WHY NOT SEEK FOR HAPPINESS I SAID TO MYSELF MOREOVER I AM LOVED AND THE LOVE OFFERED ME I SHALL ACCEPT MY MARRIED LIFE WILL BE NO SLAVERY BUT RATHER A PERPETUAL REIGN
YOU SEE THAT HE FANCIES HIMSELF VANITY OF MEN THE CHOSEN OF MY HEART JUST AS THOUGH THERE WERE NO LEGAL BONDS NEVERTHELESS I HAVE NOT YET GOT BEYOND THAT EXTERNAL ATTRACTION WHICH GIVES US STRENGTH TO PUT UP WITH A GOOD DEAL
OH YES I SHALL NEVER BE IN WANT OF SOMETHING TO TALK OF AGAIN TO MISSUS ALLEN OR ANYBODY ELSE I REALLY BELIEVE I SHALL ALWAYS BE TALKING OF BATH WHEN I AM AT HOME AGAIN
I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU BY FOR THE WORLD INDEED YOU DO ME INJUSTICE I WOULD NOT HAVE MADE SO IMPROPER A REMARK UPON ANY ACCOUNT AND BESIDES I AM SURE IT WOULD NEVER HAVE ENTERED MY HEAD
WITH MORE THAN USUAL EAGERNESS DID CATHERINE HASTEN TO THE PUMP ROOM THE NEXT DAY SECURE WITHIN HERSELF OF SEEING MISTER TILNEY THERE BEFORE THE MORNING WERE OVER AND READY TO MEET HIM WITH A SMILE BUT NO SMILE WAS DEMANDED
UP THE STEPS AND DOWN PEOPLE WHOM NOBODY CARED ABOUT AND NOBODY WANTED TO SEE AND HE ONLY WAS ABSENT WHAT A DELIGHTFUL PLACE BATH IS SAID MISSUS ALLEN AS THEY SAT DOWN NEAR THE GREAT CLOCK
THAT THOUGH CATHERINE'S SUPPORTING OPINION WAS NOT UNFREQUENTLY CALLED FOR BY ONE OR THE OTHER SHE WAS NEVER ABLE TO GIVE ANY
WAS REPEATED BY THEM ALL TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER FOR A MOMENT CATHERINE WAS SURPRISED BUT MISSUS THORPE AND HER DAUGHTERS HAD SCARCELY BEGUN THE HISTORY OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER JAMES MORLAND
FIGURE AND DRESS AND FELT GRATEFUL AS WELL SHE MIGHT FOR THE CHANCE WHICH HAD PROCURED HER SUCH A FRIEND MISSUS THORPE WAS A WIDOW AND NOT A VERY RICH ONE SHE WAS A GOOD HUMOURED WELL MEANING WOMAN
EACH TO ENDEAVOUR TO GIVE THE OTHER NO CAUSE FOR WISHING THAT HE OR SHE HAD BESTOWED THEMSELVES ELSEWHERE AND THEIR BEST INTEREST TO KEEP THEIR OWN IMAGINATIONS FROM WANDERING TOWARDS THE PERFECTIONS OF THEIR NEIGHBOURS
TO ESCAPE AND AS SHE BELIEVED SO NARROWLY ESCAPE JOHN THORPE AND TO BE ASKED SO IMMEDIATELY ON HIS JOINING HER ASKED BY MISTER TILNEY AS IF HE HAD SOUGHT HER ON PURPOSE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO HER THAT LIFE COULD SUPPLY ANY GREATER FELICITY
REALLY OUR OPINIONS WERE SO EXACTLY THE SAME IT WAS QUITE RIDICULOUS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE POINT IN WHICH WE DIFFERED I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU BY FOR THE WORLD YOU ARE SUCH A SLY THING I AM SURE YOU WOULD HAVE MADE SOME DROLL REMARK OR OTHER ABOUT IT
AND ALMOST FORGOT MISTER TILNEY WHILE SHE TALKED TO MISS THORPE FRIENDSHIP IS CERTAINLY THE FINEST BALM FOR THE PANGS OF DISAPPOINTED LOVE THEIR CONVERSATION TURNED UPON THOSE SUBJECTS OF WHICH THE FREE DISCUSSION HAS GENERALLY MUCH TO DO IN PERFECTING A SUDDEN INTIMACY BETWEEN TWO YOUNG LADIES
MISTER THORPE IS SUCH A VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MY BROTHER'S THAT IF HE TALKS TO ME I MUST TALK TO HIM AGAIN BUT THERE ARE HARDLY THREE YOUNG MEN IN THE ROOM BESIDES HIM THAT I HAVE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH AND IS THAT TO BE MY ONLY SECURITY ALAS ALAS
TILNEY HE REPEATED HUM I DO NOT KNOW HIM A GOOD FIGURE OF A MAN WELL PUT TOGETHER
FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES AND THIRTY MORE TO REINFLAME ITSELF BENEATH HIS PAW MY ANCESTORS AND I OUR BIRTHPLACE HAD WHERE FIRST IS FOUND THE LAST WARD OF THE CITY BY HIM WHO RUNNETH IN YOUR ANNUAL GAME SUFFICE IT OF MY ELDERS TO HEAR THIS
AND IF IT DO REMAIN SAY IN WHAT MANNER AFTER YE ARE AGAIN MADE VISIBLE IT CAN BE THAT IT INJURE NOT YOUR SIGHT AS BY A GREATER GLADNESS URGED AND DRAWN THEY WHO ARE DANCING IN A RING SOMETIMES UPLIFT THEIR VOICES AND THEIR MOTIONS QUICKEN
NOR SOLE FOR THEM PERHAPS BUT FOR THE MOTHERS THE FATHERS AND THE REST WHO HAD BEEN DEAR OR EVER THEY BECAME ETERNAL FLAMES AND LO ALL ROUND ABOUT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AROSE A LUSTRE OVER WHAT WAS THERE LIKE AN HORIZON THAT IS CLEARING UP
WHICH SURPASSED SHALL IN ITS DOWNFALL BE AS IN ITS RISE
ALREADY RISING WAS BUT FROM LOW PEOPLE SO THAT IT PLEASED NOT UBERTIN DONATO THAT HIS WIFE'S FATHER SHOULD MAKE HIM THEIR KIN ALREADY HAD CAPONSACCO TO THE MARKET FROM FESOLE DESCENDED AND ALREADY GIUDA AND INFANGATO WERE GOOD BURGHERS
SO LIKEWISE DID THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE WHO EVERMORE WHEN VACANT IS YOUR CHURCH FATTEN BY STAYING IN CONSISTORY THE INSOLENT RACE THAT LIKE A DRAGON FOLLOWS WHOEVER FLEES AND UNTO HIM THAT SHOWS HIS TEETH OR PURSE IS GENTLE AS A LAMB
BOTH TO THE YES AND NO THOU SEEST NOT FOR VERY LOW AMONG THE FOOLS IS HE WHO AFFIRMS WITHOUT DISTINCTION OR DENIES AS WELL IN ONE AS IN THE OTHER CASE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS THAT FULL OFTEN BENDS CURRENT OPINION IN THE FALSE DIRECTION
MORONTO WAS MY BROTHER AND ELISEO FROM VAL DI PADO CAME TO ME MY WIFE AND FROM THAT PLACE THY SURNAME WAS DERIVED I FOLLOWED AFTERWARD THE EMPEROR CONRAD AND HE BEGIRT ME OF HIS CHIVALRY SO MUCH I PLEASED HIM WITH MY NOBLE DEEDS
THAT HEAVEN'S RIGHT HAND DOTH TIGHTEN AND RELAX HOW UNTO JUST ENTREATIES SHALL BE DEAF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH TO GIVE ME DESIRE OF PRAYING THEM WITH ONE ACCORD GREW SILENT TIS WELL THAT WITHOUT END HE SHOULD LAMENT
SO THAT THE SIGHT SEEMS REAL AND UNREAL IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NEW SUBSISTENCES BEGAN THERE TO BE SEEN AND MAKE A CIRCLE OUTSIDE THE OTHER TWO CIRCUMFERENCES O VERY SPARKLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT HOW SUDDEN AND INCANDESCENT IT BECAME UNTO MINE EYES THAT VANQUISHED BORE IT NOT
I AM AS I AM WONT TWILL NOT BE FROM CASAL NOR ACQUASPARTA FROM WHENCE COME SUCH UNTO THE WRITTEN WORD THAT ONE AVOIDS IT AND THE OTHER NARROWS
AS FROM WITHOUT TIS STRUCK OR FROM WITHIN INTO MY MIND UPON A SUDDEN DROPPED WHAT I AM SAYING AT THE MOMENT WHEN SILENT BECAME THE GLORIOUS LIFE OF THOMAS BECAUSE OF THE RESEMBLANCE THAT WAS BORN OF HIS DISCOURSE AND THAT OF BEATRICE WHOM AFTER HIM IT PLEASED THUS TO BEGIN
AND HAVING THROWN OPEN EACH FOLDING DOOR THE SECOND BEING SECURED ONLY BY BOLTS OF LESS WONDERFUL CONSTRUCTION THAN THE LOCK THOUGH IN THAT HER EYE COULD NOT DISCERN ANYTHING UNUSUAL A DOUBLE RANGE OF SMALL DRAWERS APPEARED IN VIEW WITH SOME LARGER DRAWERS ABOVE AND BELOW THEM AND IN THE CENTRE
AND IN NOT ONE WAS ANYTHING FOUND WELL READ IN THE ART OF CONCEALING A TREASURE THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE LININGS TO THE DRAWERS DID NOT ESCAPE HER AND SHE FELT ROUND EACH WITH ANXIOUS ACUTENESS IN VAIN THE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE ALONE REMAINED NOW UNEXPLORED AND THOUGH SHE HAD
SHE HAD OFTEN READ OF SUCH CHARACTERS CHARACTERS WHICH MISTER ALLEN HAD BEEN USED TO CALL UNNATURAL AND OVERDRAWN BUT HERE WAS PROOF POSITIVE OF THE CONTRARY SHE HAD JUST SETTLED THIS POINT WHEN THE END OF THE PATH BROUGHT THEM DIRECTLY UPON THE GENERAL
AS SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE LAWN THE WHOLE BUILDING ENCLOSED A LARGE COURT AND TWO SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE RICH IN GOTHIC ORNAMENTS STOOD FORWARD FOR ADMIRATION THE REMAINDER WAS SHUT OFF BY KNOLLS OF OLD TREES OR LUXURIANT PLANTATIONS
HER QUICK EYES DIRECTLY FELL ON A ROLL OF PAPER PUSHED BACK INTO THE FURTHER PART OF THE CAVITY APPARENTLY FOR CONCEALMENT AND HER FEELINGS AT THAT MOMENT WERE INDESCRIBABLE HER HEART FLUTTERED HER KNEES TREMBLED AND HER CHEEKS GREW PALE
AS IF SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED THE FIRE THEREFORE DIED AWAY AND CATHERINE HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED WHEN ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ATTENTIONS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXCITED AND WHAT HAD BEEN TERROR AND DISLIKE BEFORE WAS NOW ABSOLUTE AVERSION YES AVERSION HIS CRUELTY TO SUCH A CHARMING WOMAN MADE HIM ODIOUS TO HER
ALARMED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED SHE TRIED IT ANOTHER WAY A BOLT FLEW AND SHE BELIEVED HERSELF SUCCESSFUL BUT HOW STRANGELY MYSTERIOUS THE DOOR WAS STILL IMMOVABLE SHE PAUSED A MOMENT IN BREATHLESS WONDER
BELIEVE THE LAST LETTER TO BE A T AND YET THAT IT SHOULD BE ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT HOUSE WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO RAISE NO COMMON DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT IF NOT ORIGINALLY THEIRS BY WHAT STRANGE EVENTS COULD IT HAVE FALLEN INTO THE TILNEY FAMILY HER FEARFUL CURIOSITY
AND HAD SEEN ONLY A FEW OF ITS ROOMS THE NETTING BOX JUST LEISURELY DRAWN FORTH WAS CLOSED WITH JOYFUL HASTE AND SHE WAS READY TO ATTEND HIM IN A MOMENT
BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM MADE HER STARTING QUIT HER HOLD AND THE LID CLOSED WITH ALARMING VIOLENCE THIS ILL TIMED INTRUDER WAS MISS TILNEY'S MAID SENT BY HER MISTRESS TO BE OF USE TO MISS MORLAND AND THOUGH CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED HER
SHE COULD NOT REMAIN MANY PACES FROM THE CHEST AT LENGTH HOWEVER HAVING SLIPPED ONE ARM INTO HER GOWN HER TOILETTE SEEMED SO NEARLY FINISHED THAT THE IMPATIENCE OF HER CURIOSITY MIGHT SAFELY BE INDULGED
MISS TILNEY CONTINUING SILENT SHE VENTURED TO SAY HER DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT AFFLICTION A GREAT AND INCREASING ONE REPLIED THE OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
A GLANCE AT THE OLD CHEST AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THIS EXAMINATION WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS USE SHE SCORNED THE CAUSELESS FEARS OF AN IDLE FANCY AND BEGAN WITH A MOST HAPPY INDIFFERENCE TO PREPARE HERSELF FOR BED SHE SHOULD TAKE HER TIME SHE SHOULD NOT HURRY HERSELF
SHE WAS HANDSOME SHE WAS VIGOROUS IN HER ANIMAL SPIRITS THERE WAS AN AFFLUENCE OF LIFE AND CERTAINTY OF FLOW SUCH AS EXCITED MY WONDER WHILE IT BAFFLED MY COMPREHENSION I COULD TALK A WHILE WHEN THE EVENING COMMENCED
BUT HE WAS SO SLY AND CAUTIOUS THAT NO ONE HAD EVER CAUGHT HIM IN THE ACT OF STEALING ALTHOUGH A GOOD MANY THINGS HAD BEEN MISSED AFTER THEY HAD FALLEN INTO THE OLD MAN'S WAY BARNEY HAD ONE SON NAMED TOM
THEY CLUNG TO THE PURPLE MOORS BEHIND AND AROUND THEIR DWELLING TO THE HOLLOW VALE INTO WHICH THE PEBBLY BRIDLE PATH LEADING FROM THEIR GATE DESCENDED AND WHICH WOUND BETWEEN FERN BANKS FIRST AND THEN AMONGST A FEW OF THE WILDEST LITTLE PASTURE FIELDS
I MUST PUT A SQUEAK IN IT SAID SANTA SO HE TOOK A BOX OF SQUEAKS FROM A SHELF AND PUT ONE INTO THE RABBIT BEFORE HE SEWED IT UP WHEN IT WAS ALL FINISHED HE PRESSED THE TOY RABBIT WITH HIS THUMB AND IT SQUEAKED SO NATURALLY THAT I JUMPED OFF THE TABLE
AND THEN SHE ROMPED AWAY TO THE FIELDS TO AMUSE HERSELF IN HER OWN WAY SHE CAME TO KNOW EVERY FLOWER THAT GREW AND TO CALL THEM BY NAME AND SHE ALWAYS STEPPED VERY CAREFULLY TO AVOID TREADING ON THEM FOR DOROTHY WAS A KIND HEARTED CHILD
AND SANTA CLAUS WHEN HE SEES ME ALWAYS GIVES ME A NOD AND A SMILE AND THEN I LOOK AFTER HIM AND HIS BIG LOAD OF TOYS WHICH HE IS CARRYING TO THE CHILDREN UNTIL HE HAS GALLOPED AWAY OUT OF SIGHT I LIKE TO SEE THE TOYS FOR THEY ARE SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY
THE PIG IS EAT YOUR HONOR HE ANSWERED THE FARMER SAID NEVER A WORD BUT HIS FACE GREW BLACK WITH ANGER AND UNBUCKLING THE STRAP THAT WAS ABOUT HIS WAIST HE WAVED IT AROUND HIS HEAD AND WHACK
THE FARMER GAVE ME NOTHING BUT A SCOLDING BUT THERE WAS A VERY NICE PIG RUNNING AROUND THE YARD HOW BIG WAS IT ASKED BARNEY OH JUST ABOUT BIG ENOUGH TO MAKE A NICE DINNER FOR YOU AND ME
AND AID THEM WHEN AND WHERE THEY WOULD ALLOW ME THERE WAS A REVIVING PLEASURE IN THIS INTERCOURSE OF A KIND NOW TASTED BY ME FOR THE FIRST TIME
SANTA NEVER FORGETS ME AND EVERY TIME HE PASSES HE CALLS OUT IN HIS JOLLY VOICE A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU BUN RABBIT THE BABIES STILL LOVE YOU DEARLY THE RABBIT PAUSED AND DOROTHY WAS JUST ABOUT TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION
IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE PIPER HAD THE PIG KILLED AND CUT INTO PIECES AND BOILING IN THE POT ONLY THE TAIL WAS LEFT OUT FOR TOM WANTED TO MAKE A WHISTLE OF IT AND AS THERE WAS PLENTY TO EAT BESIDES THE TAIL HIS FATHER LET HIM HAVE IT
I AM NOT AFRAID OF HIM NOR OF HIS REINDEER AND IT IS SUCH FUN TO SEE HIM COME DASHING ALONG CRACKING HIS WHIP AND CALLING OUT CHEERILY TO HIS REINDEER WHO ARE ABLE TO RUN EVEN SWIFTER THAN WE RABBITS
IT WAS ONE MORNING AFTER CHRISTMAS SAID THE RABBIT WHO SEEMED TO ENJOY TALKING NOW THAT HE HAD OVERCOME HIS FEAR OF DOROTHY AND I WAS SITTING BY THE ROAD SIDE WHEN SANTA CLAUS CAME RIDING BACK IN HIS EMPTY SLEIGH HE DOES NOT COME HOME QUITE SO FAST AS HE GOES
ARE IN THE RIGHT BUT THE SOMBRE COLOURS ARE REFLECTIONS FROM THEIR OWN JAUNDICED EYES AND HEARTS THE REAL HUES ARE DELICATE AND NEED A CLEARER VISION IT IS WORTHY OF REMARK AND OLIVER DID NOT FAIL TO NOTE IT AT THE TIME THAT HIS MORNING EXPEDITIONS WERE NO LONGER MADE ALONE
WILL BE INFLUENCED AND MATERIALLY INFLUENCED BY THE MERE SILENT PRESENCE OF SOME EXTERNAL OBJECT WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN NEAR US WHEN WE CLOSED OUR EYES AND OF WHOSE VICINITY WE HAVE HAD NO WAKING CONSCIOUSNESS
GETTING OUT OF A COACH REPLIED OLIVER SHEDDING TEARS OF DELIGHT AND GOING INTO A HOUSE I DIDN'T SPEAK TO HIM I COULDN'T SPEAK TO HIM FOR HE DIDN'T SEE ME AND I TREMBLED SO THAT I WAS NOT ABLE TO GO UP TO HIM BUT GILES ASKED FOR ME
HE IS COGNIZANT OF THE BUSINESS ON WHICH I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU MISTER BROWNLOW INCLINED HIS HEAD MISTER GRIMWIG WHO HAD MADE ONE VERY STIFF BOW AND RISEN FROM HIS CHAIR MADE ANOTHER VERY STIFF BOW AND DROPPED INTO IT AGAIN
WILL HAVE BEGUN TO THINK BY THIS TIME THAT WE HAVE WEARIED OF HIS COMPANY AND ENTERED INTO SOME DARK CONSPIRACY TO THRUST HIM FORTH UPON THE WORLD
WHICH OCCASIONED HIM NO LITTLE SURPRISE AND PERPLEXITY ROSE ALSO EXPLAINED HER REASONS FOR NOT CONFIDING IN HER FRIEND MISTER LOSBERNE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE OLD GENTLEMAN CONSIDERED THAT SHE HAD ACTED PRUDENTLY
I'D SEND THEM ONE AND ALL TO NEVER MIND WHERE INTERPOSED MISTER BROWNLOW BUT REFLECT WHETHER SENDING THEM ANYWHERE IS LIKELY TO ATTAIN THE OBJECT WE HAVE IN VIEW WHAT OBJECT ASKED THE DOCTOR
AND WERE WITHAL AS ORIGINAL AND AS MUCH TO THE PURPOSE AS THE REMARKS OF GREAT MEN COMMONLY ARE ABOVE STAIRS THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY FOR THE DOCTOR WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS AND HOWEVER FATIGUED OR THOUGHTFUL HARRY MAYLIE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT FIRST
SAID MISTER BROWNLOW RATHER TESTILY WELL THAT I DO SIR REPLIED THE OLD LADY PEOPLE'S EYES AT MY TIME OF LIFE DON'T IMPROVE WITH AGE SIR I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT REJOINED MISTER BROWNLOW
GRIMWIG WILL YOU LEAVE US FOR A FEW MINUTES I BELIEVE INTERPOSED MISS MAYLIE THAT AT THIS PERIOD OF OUR INTERVIEW I NEED NOT GIVE THAT GENTLEMAN THE TROUBLE OF GOING AWAY IF I AM CORRECTLY INFORMED
HAD BEEN SITTING ON THE STEPS OF THE CHAISE SUPPORTING AN ELBOW ON EACH KNEE AND WIPING HIS EYES WITH A BLUE COTTON POCKET HANDKERCHIEF DOTTED WITH WHITE SPOTS THAT THE HONEST FELLOW HAD NOT BEEN FEIGNING EMOTION
AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES LIKE MISFORTUNES SELDOM COME ALONE HER SITUATION WAS INDEED ONE OF NO COMMON TRIAL AND DIFFICULTY
HAUL HIM TO THE ALCOVE SEE LORD MACAULAY'S JAGS OF ANCIENT ROME AMBITION THE ONLY DISEASE WHICH LAZINESS CAN CURE AMUSEMENT
PASS THE BUTTER T L THE LIMIT PREFACE SOME EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO I TOOK THIS BRILLIANT BUNCH OF BRAIN BURRS TO MY ESTEEMED PUBLISHER
HE HAD BECOME THE SWELL BRUISER THE ARISTOCRATIC PUGILIST THE CRACK BULLY OF THE LOCAL CORINTHIANS FOR THE TARASCONERS FROM HIS BUILD BEARING STYLE THAT ASPECT OF A GUARD'S
QUICKLY GLANCING TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT ERE BANGING THE DOOR TO AND FASTENING IT SMARTLY WITH DOUBLE LOCKING THEN ON THE WAY NOT SO MUCH AS A CAT UPON THE AVIGNON ROAD
A WILD ADVENTUROUS SPIRIT WHICH DREAMT OF NOTHING BUT BATTLES RACES ACROSS THE PAMPAS MIGHTY BATTUES DESERT SANDS BLIZZARDS AND TYPHOONS IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO GO OUT EVERY SUNDAY TO POP AT A CAP
A FLAT IS THE POOR RELATION OF AN APARTMENT ABROAD A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE GO TO BE CURED OF VISITING FOREIGN LANDS ABSCOND TO DUCK WITH THE DOUGH
CONSTANTLY HOPED THAT BEYOND THE TURN OF ONE OF THESE CUT THROATS HAUNTS THEY WOULD LEAP FROM THE SHADOW AND FALL ON HIS BACK I WARRANT YOU THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN WARMLY RECEIVED THOUGH
THE VERY BIRDS OF PASSAGE HAVE TICKED IT OFF ON THEIR GUIDE BOOKS AND WHEN THE WILD DUCKS COMING DOWN TOWARDS THE CAMARGUE IN LONG TRIANGLES
I WAS PAINED AND SURPRISED TO OBSERVE THAT MY STOMACH DID NOT TRAVEL WITH ME
ACCORDING TO WHAT HE IS LOADED FOR THE MAN WHO LODGES MOST SHOT IN HIS CAP IS HAILED AS KING OF THE HUNT AND STALKS BACK TRIUMPHANTLY AT DUSK INTO TARASCON
PREFERRED TERRA FIRMA WE ARE AFRAID WE MUST MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT IN OUR HERO THERE WERE TWO VERY DISTINCT CHARACTERS
AND TAKING HIS FINGERS OFF THE PUBLIC PULSE DON'T YOU NOAH LOTT CHESTNUT HILL
ARMING HIMSELF CAPA PIE TO GO TO HIS CLUB AT NINE
EVERY SUNDAY MORNING OUT HE WOULD MARCH IN A NEW CAP AND BACK HE WOULD STRUT EVERY SUNDAY EVENING WITH A MERE THING OF SHREDS THE LOFT OF BAOBAB VILLA
MA WASN'T SICK TO AMOUNT TO ANYTHING
AT HALF PAST SEVEN THEY WOULD SPREAD NEWSPAPERS OVER THE FURNITURE TO CATCH THE PIECES OF PLASTERING THAT FELL WHEN THE FAT MAN IN THE FLAT OVERHEAD BEGAN TO TAKE HIS PHYSICAL CULTURE EXERCISES EXACTLY AT EIGHT
YOU EXPECTED TO SEE HER COLOSSAL FIGURE LOOM THROUGH THAT REEKING BLUE CLOUD OF SMOKE FROM FRYING FAT JUST AS YOU EXPECT THE PALISADES TO APPEAR THROUGH A DRIFTING HUDSON RIVER FOG
HICKEY AND MOONEY OF THE VAUDEVILLE TEAM UNBOOKED IN THE FLAT ACROSS THE HALL WOULD YIELD TO THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF DELIRIUM TREMENS AND BEGIN TO OVERTURN CHAIRS UNDER THE DELUSION THAT HAMMERSTEIN WAS PURSUING THEM
I LOOKED BACK AND SAW HIM SHAKING WITH INAUDIBLE LAUGHTER BEHIND HIS FILM NOW AND THEN WE PAID UP BACK SCORES BUT THE CHIEF THING AT CYPHER'S WAS MILLY MILLY WAS A WAITRESS
READY TO MELT IN THE CRUCIBLE OF HER IRE A LITTLE MORE GOLD PLATING FROM THE WROUGHT STEEL CHAINS OF MATRIMONY FOR THESE THINGS CUPID WILL HAVE TO ANSWER WHEN HE STANDS AT THE BAR OF JUSTICE WITH HIS VICTIMS FROM THE FROGMORE FLATS
IT STILL RETAINED SOMETHING OF HER CONTOUR MIDWAY OF THE SLEEVES WERE FINE INDIVIDUAL WRINKLES MADE BY THE MOVEMENTS OF HER ARMS IN WORKING FOR HIS COMFORT AND PLEASURE A DELICATE BUT IMPELLING ODOR OF BLUEBELLS CAME FROM IT
PROMPTLY ON TIME THE COUNTERFEIT PRESENTMENT OF MOUNTED POLICEMAN O'ROON SINGLE FOOTED INTO THE PARK ON HIS CHESTNUT STEED IN A UNIFORM TWO MEN WHO ARE UNLIKE WILL LOOK ALIKE
MILLY STEERED HER MAGNIFICENT WAY LIKE SOME GREAT LINER CLEAVING AMONG THE CANOES OF HOWLING SAVAGES OUR GODDESS OF GRUB WAS BUILT ON LINES SO MAJESTIC THAT THEY COULD BE FOLLOWED ONLY WITH AWE
AND SCOTCH CAP FROM POSSIBLE DEATH WHERE WAS POLICEMAN O'ROON OFF HIS BEAT EXPOSED DISGRACED DISCHARGED
ONCE WHEN WE LEFT HIM UNPAID
AND SPEECHES AND THE SPANIARD WAS BEARDED AGAIN IN RECAPITULATION AND WHEN DAYLIGHT THREATENED THEM THE SURVIVORS PREPARED TO DEPART BUT SOME REMAINED UPON THE BATTLEFIELD ONE OF THESE WAS TROOPER O'ROON WHO WAS NOT SEASONED TO POTENT LIQUIDS
OVER SEAS AND MANY LANDS AND BENEATH THEM
WE SHALL KNOW MORE THAN WE KNOW NOW BUT TO BEGIN ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A WICKED SPRITE INDEED HE WAS THE MOST MISCHIEVOUS OF ALL SPRITES ONE DAY HE WAS IN A VERY GOOD HUMOR FOR HE HAD MADE A MIRROR
WITH THE POWER OF CAUSING ALL THAT WAS GOOD AND BEAUTIFUL WHEN IT WAS REFLECTED THEREIN TO LOOK POOR AND MEAN BUT THAT WHICH WAS GOOD FOR NOTHING AND LOOKED UGLY WAS SHOWN MAGNIFIED AND INCREASED IN UGLINESS IN THIS MIRROR
AND OUT OF EACH PEEPED A GENTLE FRIENDLY EYE IT WAS THE LITTLE BOY
FOR THE STREAM DRIFTED THE BOAT QUITE NEAR THE LAND GERDA CALLED STILL LOUDER AND AN OLD WOMAN THEN CAME OUT OF THE COTTAGE LEANING UPON A CROOKED STICK SHE HAD A LARGE BROAD BRIMMED HAT ON
AND KAY TIED ON HIS SLEDGE AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD AND OFF HE DROVE WITH IT ON THEY WENT QUICKER AND QUICKER INTO THE NEXT STREET AND THE PERSON WHO DROVE TURNED ROUND TO KAY AND NODDED TO HIM IN A FRIENDLY MANNER JUST AS IF THEY KNEW EACH OTHER
SAID THE ROSES WE HAVE BEEN IN THE EARTH WHERE ALL THE DEAD ARE BUT KAY WAS NOT THERE MANY THANKS SAID LITTLE GERDA AND SHE WENT TO THE OTHER FLOWERS LOOKED INTO THEIR CUPS AND ASKED
AND HER HAIR CURLED AND SHONE WITH A LOVELY GOLDEN COLOR AROUND THAT SWEET LITTLE FACE WHICH WAS SO ROUND AND SO LIKE A ROSE I HAVE OFTEN LONGED FOR SUCH A DEAR LITTLE GIRL SAID THE OLD WOMAN
I'M SURE I DON'T KNOW THE LION GROWLED OUT AS HE LAY DOWN AGAIN THERE WAS TOO MUCH DUST TO SEE ANYTHING WHAT A TIME THE MONSTER IS CUTTING UP THAT CAKE
SO THEY TROTTED ON IN SILENCE TILL THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF A GREAT CROWD IN THE MIDDLE OF WHICH THE LION AND UNICORN WERE FIGHTING THEY WERE IN SUCH A CLOUD OF DUST THAT AT FIRST ALICE COULD NOT MAKE OUT WHICH WAS WHICH
THEY ARE JUST LIKE THE BOX THEY ARE PLANTED IN AND THEN HE GAVE THE BOX A GOOD KICK WITH HIS FOOT
AND THAT NOW ONLY AS THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO SEE HOW THE WORLD REALLY LOOKED THEY RAN ABOUT WITH THE MIRROR
ONE TO FETCH AND ONE TO CARRY AT THIS MOMENT THE MESSENGER ARRIVED HE WAS FAR TOO MUCH OUT OF BREATH TO SAY A WORD
AND LITTLE ROSETREES BESIDES THERE WAS A ROSE IN EACH BOX AND THEY GREW SPLENDIDLY THEY NOW THOUGHT OF PLACING THE BOXES ACROSS THE GUTTER SO THAT THEY NEARLY REACHED FROM ONE WINDOW TO THE OTHER AND LOOKED JUST LIKE TWO WALLS OF FLOWERS
AND STOOD FOR SOME TIME LOOKING AT HER WITH AN AIR OF THE DEEPEST DISGUST
AND AS HE PERCEIVED HER FRIGHT HE PULLED UP ANOTHER ROSE GOT IN AT THE WINDOW AND HASTENED OFF FROM DEAR LITTLE GERDA AFTERWARDS WHEN SHE BROUGHT HER PICTURE BOOK HE ASKED WHAT HORRID BEASTS HAVE YOU THERE
WE CAN DIE SECUNDEM ARTEM CRIED THE TROOPER TO THIS OBSERVATION THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT DEIGN TO REPLY BUT DEEMING IT NECESSARY TO HIS PROFESSIONAL DIGNITY THAT THE CONVERSATION SHOULD CONTINUE HE ADDED PERHAPS IN THIS INSTANCE JUDICIOUS TREATMENT MIGHT HAVE PROLONGED THE LIFE OF THE PATIENT
DOCTOR SITGREAVES DOES NOT MEAN A RIG'LAR SOLDIER BUT A REGULAR PHYSICIAN MADAM SAID THE TROOPER OH CRIED THE MAIDEN AGAIN CORRECTING HERSELF FOR THE BEST OF ALL REASONS THERE WAS NONE TO BE HAD SO I TOOK CARE OF HIM MYSELF
I'M SURE HARVEY HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH ALREADY FROM HAVING SO MUCH CONCERNS WITH THE RIG'LARS REPLIED THE HOUSEKEEPER HE HAS LOST HIS ALL AND MADE HIMSELF A VAGABOND THROUGH THE LAND AND I HAVE REASON TO RUE THE DAY I EVER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
THE ANGEL I SAW MAY BE A DAUGHTER A SISTER OR A NIECE BUT NEVER AN AUNT HUSH GEORGE HUSH YOUR TALKING HAS BROUGHT YOUR PULSE UP AGAIN YOU MUST OBSERVE QUIET AND PREPARE FOR A MEETING WITH YOUR OWN SISTER WHO WILL BE HERE WITHIN AN HOUR WHAT ISABELLA AND WHO SENT FOR HER
THERE IS BUT LITTLE DANGER OF EXCEEDING THE TRUTH
BUT MY HUMBLE KNOWLEDGE IS LIMITED TO THE SETTING OF A SQUADRON IN THE FIELD AND USING IT WHEN THERE I BEG LEAVE TO REFER YOU TO DOCTOR ARCHIBALD SITGREAVES A GENTLEMAN OF UNIVERSAL ATTAINMENTS AND UNBOUNDED PHILANTHROPY THE VERY MILK OF HUMAN SYMPATHIES AND A MORTAL FOE TO ALL INDISCRIMINATE CUTTING
BUT HE LEAVES HIS ROOM AND THINKS HIS WOUND LIGHTLY PURCHASED BY THE PLEASURE OF BEING WITH HIS FRIENDS IF SHE ADDED WITH A TREMULOUS LIP THIS DREADFUL SUSPICION THAT IS AFFIXED TO HIS VISIT WERE REMOVED I COULD CONSIDER HIS WOUND OF LITTLE MOMENT YOU NOW HAVE THE FRUITS OF REBELLION BROUGHT HOME TO YOU
MISS PEYTON WAS LOOKING FROM A WINDOW IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TENEMENT OF THE PEDDLER AND WAS EXPRESSING A KIND ANXIETY AFTER THE WELFARE OF THE SICK MAN WHEN THE PERSON OF KATY SUDDENLY EMERGED FROM THE DENSE COVERING OF AN EARTHLY CLOUD WHOSE MISTS WERE SCATTERING BEFORE THE CHEERING RAYS OF THE SUN
IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR A MAN TO GET A WIFE AT ALL IN SUCH A PREDICARY DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD MISS PEYTON I SELDOM TROUBLE MYSELF WITH SUCH THINGS SAID THE LADY GRAVELY DURING THIS DIALOGUE CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN STUDYING THE COUNTENANCE AND MANNER OF THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH A MOST LUDICROUS GRAVITY
HIS CASE YOUNG LADY EXCEEDS MY ART TO HEAL AND I TAKE IT SIR HENRY CLINTON IS THE BEST ADVISER HE CAN APPLY TO THOUGH MAJOR DUNWOODIE HAS MADE THE COMMUNICATION WITH HIS LEECH RATHER DIFFICULT FRANCES SMILED BUT AVERTED HER FACE WHILE SARAH MOVED WITH THE GRACE OF AN OFFENDED JUNO FROM THE APARTMENT
AT LENGTH A SINGLE HORSE CHAISE WAS SEEN MAKING ITS WAY CAREFULLY AMONG THE STONES WHICH LAY SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY ROAD THAT WOUND THROUGH THE VALLEY AND APPROACHED THE COTTAGE
BUT I SUPPOSE HIS TIME HAD COME AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT MATTERS BUT LITTLE WHAT DOCTOR'S STUFF WE TAKE LET ME SET YOU RIGHT IN THAT PARTICULAR INTERRUPTED THE SURGEON WE MUST ALL DIE IT IS TRUE BUT IT IS PERMITTED US TO USE THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE IN ARRESTING DANGERS AS THEY OCCUR UNTIL
HOW IS THIS HE SAID ARE YOU TIRED OF YOUR GOOD BLACK AUSTER OH NO NOT AT ALL SHE REPLIED BUT I AM AMIABLE ENOUGH TO LET YOU RIDE HIM FOR ONCE
I WAS PUT WITH TWO OR THREE OTHER STRONG USEFUL LOOKING HORSES AND A GOOD MANY PEOPLE CAME TO LOOK AT US THE GENTLEMEN ALWAYS TURNED FROM ME WHEN THEY SAW MY BROKEN KNEES
AND NOT ANOTHER SIXPENCE YES OR NO DONE SAID THE SALESMAN AND YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT THERE'S A MONSTROUS DEAL OF QUALITY IN THAT HORSE AND IF YOU WANT HIM FOR CAB WORK HE'S A BARGAIN
I AM NOT VERY YOUNG SO I WILL HAVE THE ELDEST AND THEY WERE MARRIED THAT VERY DAY
WHEN THEY CAME TO THE STAIRS THE SOLDIER RAN ON BEFORE THE PRINCESSES AND LAID HIMSELF DOWN AND AS THE TWELVE SISTERS SLOWLY CAME UP VERY MUCH TIRED THEY HEARD HIM SNORING IN HIS BED SO THEY SAID
AT LAST IN PASSING THROUGH ONE WE CAME TO A LONG CAB STAND WHEN MY RIDER CALLED OUT IN A CHEERY VOICE GOOD NIGHT GOVERNOR HALLOO CRIED A VOICE HAVE YOU GOT A GOOD ONE I THINK SO REPLIED MY OWNER
AS IF HE WAS FAST ASLEEP WHEN THE TWELVE PRINCESSES HEARD THIS THEY LAUGHED HEARTILY AND THE ELDEST SAID THIS FELLOW TOO MIGHT HAVE DONE A WISER THING THAN LOSE HIS LIFE IN THIS WAY
THEN HE LAID HIMSELF DOWN ON HIS BED AND IN A LITTLE WHILE
AND THE HEAD GROOM WAS LEFT IN CHARGE THE LADY HARRIET WHO REMAINED AT THE HALL WAS A GREAT INVALID AND NEVER WENT OUT IN THE CARRIAGE AND THE LADY ANNE PREFERRED RIDING ON HORSEBACK WITH HER BROTHER OR COUSINS
SO THAT WHEN SHE PUT THE CUP TO HER MOUTH IT WAS EMPTY AT THIS TOO THE YOUNGEST SISTER WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED BUT THE ELDEST ALWAYS SILENCED HER
AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL MASH READY FOR ME SAUSAGE DUMPLING AND APPLE TURNOVER SHOUTED THE BOY WHICH SET THEM ALL LAUGHING I WAS LED INTO A COMFORTABLE CLEAN SMELLING STALL WITH PLENTY OF DRY STRAW
AND IF A HORSE MAY SPEAK HIS MIND SO FAR AS HE UNDERSTANDS I SHOULD SAY THERE WERE MORE LIES TOLD AND MORE TRICKERY AT THAT HORSE FAIR
SHE WAS A PERFECT HORSEWOMAN AND AS GAY AND GENTLE AS SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL SHE CHOSE ME FOR HER HORSE AND NAMED ME BLACK AUSTER I ENJOYED THESE RIDES VERY MUCH IN THE CLEAR COLD AIR
THOSE TWO GIRLS WERE OF A DOMESTIC TYPE THAT ASSORTED ILL WITH THE WILDFIRE IN NATURE'S VEINS BUT WHEN THE STORY GIRL WREATHED HER NUT BROWN TRESSES WITH CRIMSON LEAVES IT SEEMED AS PETER SAID THAT THEY GREW ON HER
AND HIS DEFERENCE FOR HER OPINION MIGHT VERY WELL JUSTIFY MISSUS JENNINGS'S PERSUASION OF HIS ATTACHMENT AND WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH PERHAPS HAD NOT ELINOR STILL AS FROM THE FIRST BELIEVED MARIANNE HIS REAL FAVOURITE TO MAKE HER SUSPECT IT HERSELF
AND GREAT CITIES SPRANG UP WHERE HE HAD TRODDEN AND EVERY LAND THROUGH WHICH HE PASSED WAS BLESSED BECAUSE ONE OF THE GODS HAD COME DOWN TO MEN BUT MANY MEN AND WOMEN FOLLOWED ODIN HIMSELF
THE DAY CAME AT LAST WHEN PINOCCHIO'S MASTER WAS ABLE TO ANNOUNCE AN EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE THE ANNOUNCEMENTS POSTED ALL AROUND THE TOWN AND WRITTEN IN LARGE LETTERS READ THUS
THE GREAT SQUARE OF PEGASUS WAS OVER OUR HEADS CASSIOPEIA SAT ENTHRONED IN HER BEAUTIFUL CHAIR IN THE NORTH EAST AND NORTH OF US THE DIPPERS SWUNG UNTIRINGLY AROUND THE POLE STAR
HE HAD EATEN IT ALL DURING THE NIGHT HE TRIED THE STRAW BUT AS HE CHEWED AWAY AT IT HE NOTICED TO HIS GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT THAT IT TASTED NEITHER LIKE RICE NOR LIKE MACARONI PATIENCE HE REPEATED AS HE CHEWED
HAD SEEN SO MUCH VARIETY IN HIS ADDRESS TO HER SISTER AND HERSELF THAT SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO EXPECT TO FIND HIM IN HIS OWN FAMILY SHE FOUND HIM HOWEVER PERFECTLY THE GENTLEMAN IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO ALL HIS VISITORS
THE WILD COLD SPRAY BEAT ON HIS EYES AND BLINDED HIM SO THAT HE COULD SEE NOTHING AND THE ROAR OF THE RIVER DEAFENED HIM SO THAT HE COULD HEAR NOTHING BUT HE FELT KEENLY THE WOUNDS AND BRUISES OF THE CRUEL ROCKS
IN A FEW YEARS HE HAD BECOME A MILLIONAIRE WHAT HAPPENED TO LAMP WICK MY DEAR CHILDREN I DO NOT KNOW PINOCCHIO I CAN TELL YOU MET WITH GREAT HARDSHIPS EVEN FROM THE FIRST DAY
HAD NOT THE THOUGHT OF SWEET ALIN'S LOVING EYES BROUGHT HIM THE STRENGTH AND DESIRE TO STRUGGLE AS LONG AS IT WAS POSSIBLE LONG LONG LONG TO HIM SEEMED THAT BITTER AND PERILOUS PASSAGE
WITH A MORE WARM THOUGH LESS PUBLIC ASSURANCE FROM JOHN TO ELINOR OF THE PROMPTITUDE WITH WHICH HE SHOULD COME TO SEE HER AT DELAFORD WAS ALL THAT FORETOLD ANY MEETING IN THE COUNTRY
AND ONLY OCCASIONALLY RUDE TO HIS WIFE AND HER MOTHER SHE FOUND HIM VERY CAPABLE OF BEING A PLEASANT COMPANION AND ONLY PREVENTED FROM BEING SO ALWAYS BY TOO GREAT AN APTITUDE TO FANCY HIMSELF AS MUCH SUPERIOR TO PEOPLE IN GENERAL
I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT GOD HAS ABANDONED IT TO SOME MALIGNANT BEING I EXCEPT ALWAYS EL DORADO I SCARCELY EVER KNEW A CITY THAT DID NOT DESIRE THE DESTRUCTION OF A NEIGHBOURING CITY
BUT I CARE LITTLE FOR HIS JOURNEY TO BRUNDUSIUM AND HIS ACCOUNT OF A BAD DINNER OR OF HIS LOW QUARREL BETWEEN ONE RUPILIUS WHOSE WORDS HE SAYS WERE FULL OF POISONOUS FILTH AND ANOTHER WHOSE LANGUAGE WAS IMBUED WITH VINEGAR
PROMISING TO CHOOSE HIM WHO APPEARED TO BE MOST JUSTLY DISCONTENTED WITH HIS STATE AND TO BESTOW SOME PRESENTS UPON THE REST THEY SAT UNTIL FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING
THAT MAY BE SAID MARTIN BUT I KNOW THEM NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS DISPUTE THEY HEARD THE REPORT OF CANNON IT REDOUBLED EVERY INSTANT EACH TOOK OUT HIS GLASS
WHICH PUT CANDIDE A LITTLE OUT OF COUNTENANCE BUT WAS NOT AT ALL DISAGREEABLE TO MARTIN FIRST TWO PRETTY GIRLS VERY NEATLY DRESSED SERVED THEM WITH CHOCOLATE WHICH WAS FROTHED EXCEEDINGLY WELL
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AT SURINAM
OH OH SAID THE DUTCH SKIPPER ONCE MORE TO HIMSELF THIRTY THOUSAND PIASTRES ARE A TRIFLE TO THIS MAN SURELY THESE SHEEP MUST BE LADEN WITH AN IMMENSE TREASURE LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT
HIS INSIPID LAVINIA I THINK THERE CAN BE NOTHING MORE FLAT AND DISAGREEABLE I PREFER TASSO A GOOD DEAL OR EVEN THE SOPORIFIC TALES OF ARIOSTO
AND OBLIGED TO CONTINUE THIS ABOMINABLE TRADE WHICH APPEARS SO PLEASANT TO YOU MEN WHILE TO US WOMEN IT IS THE UTMOST ABYSS OF MISERY I HAVE COME TO EXERCISE THE PROFESSION AT VENICE
ARE ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF ANY ONE WITH THE LEAST TASTE AND HIS LONG DESCRIPTION OF A PEST HOUSE IS GOOD ONLY FOR A GRAVE DIGGER THIS OBSCURE WHIMSICAL AND DISAGREEABLE POEM WAS DESPISED UPON ITS FIRST PUBLICATION
THEN HE LISTENED PATIENTLY PROMISED TO EXAMINE INTO HIS AFFAIR AT THE SKIPPER'S RETURN AND ORDERED HIM TO PAY TEN THOUSAND PIASTRES FOR THE EXPENSE OF THE HEARING
I HAVE SOMETIMES ASKED LEARNED MEN WHETHER THEY WERE NOT AS WEARY AS I OF THAT WORK THOSE WHO WERE SINCERE HAVE OWNED TO ME THAT THE POEM MADE THEM FALL ASLEEP YET IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE IT IN THEIR LIBRARY AS A MONUMENT OF ANTIQUITY
I SHOULD BE HANGED AND SO WOULD YOU THE FAIR CUNEGONDE IS MY LORD'S FAVOURITE MISTRESS
THEY RAISED THEIR HANDS TO HEAVEN AND UTTERED TERRIBLE OUTCRIES AND THE NEXT MOMENT WERE SWALLOWED UP BY THE SEA WELL SAID MARTIN THIS IS HOW MEN TREAT ONE ANOTHER
THEY SAW TWO SHIPS IN CLOSE FIGHT ABOUT THREE MILES OFF THE WIND BROUGHT BOTH SO NEAR TO THE FRENCH VESSEL THAT OUR TRAVELLERS HAD THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THE FIGHT AT THEIR EASE
CALEB PLUMMER WITH CARE YES
FOR THAT GOOD DOG MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN HIS MASTER HAD IT SEEMED BEEN WATCHING THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN HIS SLEEP LEST HE SHOULD WALK OFF WITH A FEW YOUNG POPLAR TREES THAT WERE TIED UP BEHIND THE CART
THE PART BY THE LANDING STAGE IS IN B MINOR IF I REMEMBER RIGHTLY BUT LOWER DOWN THINGS GET EXTREMELY MIXED THERE IS A SLODGY THEME IN SEVERAL KEYS AT ONCE MEANING MUD BANKS AND ANOTHER FOR THE NAVIGABLE CANAL AND THE EXIT INTO THE BALTIC IS IN C
AND AM NOT PRETENDING
THREE MONTHS MIGHT HAVE DONE IT IN GENERAL BUT REGINALD'S FEELINGS WERE NO LESS LASTING THAN LIVELY WHETHER LADY SUSAN WAS OR WAS NOT HAPPY IN HER SECOND CHOICE I DO NOT SEE HOW IT CAN EVER BE ASCERTAINED
AND WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN HER OWN VIEWS ONLY FEARED GREATER DIFFICULTY IN ACCOMPLISHING THEM THE FIRST HOPE OF ANYTHING BETTER WAS DERIVED FROM LADY SUSAN'S ASKING HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT FREDERICA LOOKED QUITE
OH TO BE SURE SAID CALEB IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH CARE YES YES THAT'S MINE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WITH CASH INDEED IF MY DEAR BOY IN THE GOLDEN SOUTH AMERICAS HAD LIVED JOHN YOU LOVED HIM LIKE A SON DIDN'T YOU
AND DARK BRIGHT PENETRATING EYES LOOKED ROUND WITH A SMILE AND SALUTED THE CARRIER'S WIFE BY GRAVELY INCLINING HIS HEAD HIS GARB WAS VERY QUAINT AND ODD A LONG LONG WAY BEHIND THE TIME ITS HUE WAS BROWN ALL OVER
OVER TWO YEARS PASSED AND THE SCHLEGEL HOUSEHOLD CONTINUED TO LEAD ITS LIFE OF CULTURED BUT NOT IGNOBLE EASE STILL SWIMMING GRACEFULLY ON THE GREY TIDES OF LONDON
OR LIVERPOOL STREET IN THE MORNING THE CITY INHALING OR THE SAME THOROUGHFARES IN THE EVENING THE CITY EXHALING HER EXHAUSTED AIR WE REACH IN DESPERATION BEYOND THE FOG BEYOND THE VERY STARS THE VOIDS OF THE UNIVERSE ARE RANSACKED TO JUSTIFY THE MONSTER
NOT SO MUCH AS A LEAF DAMAGED FULL OF BUDS CALEB'S DULL EYE BRIGHTENED AS HE TOOK IT AND THANKED HIM DEAR CALEB SAID THE CARRIER VERY DEAR AT THIS SEASON
MARGARET WAS NOT SHOCKED BUT WENT ON SEWING FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE SHE REPLIED
OH YES OR ILFRACOMBE AND SWANAGE AND TUNBRIDGE WELLS AND SURBITON AND BEDFORD THERE ON NO ACCOUNT LONDON THEN
GOOD EVENING TILLY GOOD EVENING UNBEKNOWN HOW'S BABY MUM BOXER'S PRETTY WELL I HOPE ALL THRIVING CALEB REPLIED DOT
MALICORNE RETURNED THE RECOMMENDATION MANICAMP ADDED THE WORDS GOOD SAID MALICORNE TAKING BACK THE PAPER MANICAMP BEGAN TO COUNT OUT THE PISTOLES THERE WANT TWENTY SAID HE HOW SO THE TWENTY I HAVE WON
MONTALAIS TOOK A BOOK AND OPENED IT MALICORNE STOOD UP BRUSHED HIS HAT WITH HIS SLEEVE SMOOTHED DOWN HIS BLACK DOUBLET MONTALAIS THOUGH PRETENDING TO READ LOOKED AT HIM OUT OF THE CORNER OF HER EYE GOOD CRIED SHE FURIOUS HE HAS ASSUMED HIS RESPECTFUL AIR AND HE WILL POUT FOR A WEEK
BUT HAD PUT IT ASIDE IN A CORNER THAT THEY MIGHT ENJOY THE FIRE LIGHT UNDISTURBED LITTLE LUCIE SAT BY HER GRANDFATHER WITH HER HANDS CLASPED THROUGH HIS ARM AND HE IN A TONE NOT RISING MUCH ABOVE A WHISPER BEGAN TO TELL HER A STORY OF A GREAT AND POWERFUL FAIRY
THAT HE STOOD WITH THE LAMP IN HIS HAND
IT WILL BE MUCH THE SAME TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE MISS I SHOULD THINK RETORTED JERRY WHETHER THEY DRINK YOUR HEALTH OR THE OLD UN'S WHO'S HE SAID MISS PROSS MISTER CRUNCHER WITH SOME DIFFIDENCE EXPLAINED HIMSELF AS MEANING OLD NICK'S
AURE WOULD HAVE CRIED OUT BUT THE CRY WAS STIFLED IN HIS KISS NERVOUS AND APPARENTLY ANGRY THE YOUNG GIRL PUSHED MALICORNE AGAINST THE WALL GOOD SAID MALICORNE PHILOSOPHICALLY THAT'S ENOUGH FOR SIX WEEKS ADIEU MADEMOISELLE ACCEPT MY VERY HUMBLE SALUTATION
WELL IF YOU LOOK YOU WILL SEE THEM ON THAT CHAIR
THEIR HOUSEKEEPING WAS OF A VERY FRUGAL KIND NOT ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS THE SAFEST WAY OF LIFE INVOLVING THE LEAST OFFENCE TO THE PEOPLE BUT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT RICH AND CHARLES THROUGHOUT HIS IMPRISONMENT HAD HAD TO PAY HEAVILY FOR HIS BAD FOOD
AND WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH TWENTY PISTOLES MON DIEU WELL SAID MALICORNE A LITTLE ANGRY SUPPOSE I WERE TO ADD THEM TO THE FIVE HUNDRED YOU ALREADY OWE ME YOU ARE RIGHT REPLIED MANICAMP STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND AGAIN AND FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW I CAN ACCEPT THEM GIVE THEM TO ME
AND AFTER WHAT FASHION OH THAT IS RATHER TRYING I WARN YOU THE DEVIL
AND JERRY ALMOST WHOLLY TRANSFERRED TO THEM BY MISTER LORRY HAD BECOME THEIR DAILY RETAINER AND HAD HIS BED THERE EVERY NIGHT IT WAS AN ORDINANCE OF THE REPUBLIC ONE AND INDIVISIBLE OF LIBERTY EQUALITY FRATERNITY OR DEATH
BUT MALICORNE SUSTAINED THE ATTACK BRAVELY
SAID MISS PROSS CHEERFULLY REPRESSING A SIGH AS SHE GLANCED AT HER DARLING'S GOLDEN HAIR IN THE LIGHT OF THE FIRE THEN WE MUST HAVE PATIENCE AND WAIT THAT'S ALL WE MUST HOLD UP OUR HEADS AND FIGHT LOW AS MY BROTHER SOLOMON USED TO SAY NOW MISTER CRUNCHER
YOUR FATHER IS NOT IN THE SECRETS OF MONSIEUR LE PRINCE FOR NOTHING AN ADVANTAGE WHICH IS CONFINED TO LENDING MONSEIGNEUR MONEY
WHO MADE AN ENTRY ON HER PAD AND BECKONED TO THE GIRL NEXT TO MARIAN TO COME FORWARD STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE HE WENT SOMETIMES STOPPING A GIRL AT HER THIRD OR FOURTH LINE RARELY ALLOWING THEM TO READ FARTHER THAN THE ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH
A DIRECT SLAP IN THE FACE COULD SCARCELY HAVE CONVEYED GREATER INSULT THAN DID THAT ONE INSOLENT GLANCE THE PRINCIPAL WAS AT A LOSS AS TO ITS IMPORT SHE WISELY DECIDED TO IGNORE IT BUT STORED IT UP IN HER MEMORY FOR FUTURE REFERENCE
ELEANOR WAS THE ACKNOWLEDGED LEADER BUT EDNA WRIGHT BECAME A CLOSE SECOND AND BETWEEN THEM THEY MANAGED TO DISSEMINATE A SPIRIT OF MISCHIEF THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL THAT THE TEACHERS FOUND HARD TO COMBAT GRACE HARLOWE WATCHED THE TREND THAT AFFAIRS WERE TAKING WITH CONSIDERABLE ANXIETY
HE PROTESTED AT SUCH A STUPENDOUS COMPARISON AND INSISTED THAT SHE MAKE CLEAR THAT THE DUMMY WAS NOT INCLUDED THE SHORT AFTERNOON GLIDED INTO EVENING AND DOCTOR KEMP WENT OVER TO THE HOTEL AND DINED AT THE LEVICES TABLE
AND THE MOCK SERIOUS BANTERING TONES IN WHICH SHE DELIVERED ROSALIND'S WITTY SPEECHES CAUSED MISTER SOUTHARD TO SMILE AND NOD APPROVINGLY AS SHE GAVE FULL VALUE TO THE IMMORTAL LINES HER CHANGE OF VOICE FROM ROSALIND TO ORLANDO WAS WHOLLY DELIGHTFUL
THERE GOES ELEANOR AFTER MISS TEBBS OBSERVED MARIAN BARBER WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE'S UP TO NOW OH NEVER MIND HER SAID NORA IMPATIENTLY YOU'LL SEE ENOUGH OF HER DURING REHEARSAL IT WILL BE SO PLEASANT TO REHEARSE WITH HER
SHE CERTAINLY WILL SAID NORA BUT TO GIVE THE PLAY A REST AND COME DOWN TO EVERYDAY AFFAIRS WHERE SHALL WE MEET TO GO TO THE FOOTBALL GAME LET ME SEE SAID GRACE THE GAME IS TO BE CALLED AT THREE O'CLOCK
THEN STOPPED AND TURNING HER BACK UPON THE PHI SIGMA TAU BEGAN TALKING TO EDNA WRIGHT JUST THEN MISS TEBBS WHO HAD BEEN BUSY WITH HER LIST ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WOULD NOW NAME THE CAST AND ALL CONVERSATION CEASED AS BY MAGIC
WAS SUCH AS WOULD PROVE DANGEROUSLY SEDUCTIVE TO ANY WOMAN WHOM HE CARED TO HONOR WITH HIS FAVOR BUT WITH A GET THEE BEHIND ME SATAN DESIRE HE HAD PUT THE QUESTION FROM HIM HE COULD HAVE TAKEN HIS OATH ON RUTH'S HEART WHOLENESS
ALTHOUGH THE GIRLS BELONGING TO JULIA'S PARTY WERE SILENT CONCERNING WHAT HAPPENED AT THE OMNIBUS HOUSE THE STORY LEAKED OUT CREATING CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE TWO UPPER CLASSES JULIA CROSBY HAD A SHREWD SUSPICION
IN THE BOW I DISLIKE TO SEE DANGERS BEFORE WE COME TO THEM HE HELPED HER CAREFULLY TO HER PLACE SHE THANKED HIM LAUGHINGLY FOR HIS EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG ARM AND HE TURNED TO RUTH I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO MOVE FROM MY PLACE SHE SAID IN DEFIANT MISCHIEF
THE GIRL WAS ANNE PIERSON WHO IN SOME MYSTERIOUS MANNER HAD BEEN ALL BUT OVERLOOKED UNTIL MISS TEBBS SPIED HER STANDING BETWEEN GRACE AND NORA CAN YOU SPARE US A MOMENT MORE MISTER SOUTHARD SAID MISS TEBBS TO THE ACTOR WHO WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE
BEGAN THE READING OF THE DESIGNATED LINES HER VOICE SOUNDED UNUSUALLY CLEAR AND SWEET YET LACKED SOMETHING OF THE POWER OF EXPRESSION DISPLAYED BY GRACE IN HER RENDERING OF THE SAME SCENE WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED
FOR ANY ONE WHO WANTS A PURSE REPLIED MISS REBECCA LOOKING AT HIM IN THE MOST GENTLE WINNING WAY SEDLEY WAS GOING TO MAKE ONE OF THE MOST ELOQUENT SPEECHES POSSIBLE AND HAD BEGUN
IT'S A MERCY HE DID NOT BRING US OVER A BLACK DAUGHTER IN LAW MY DEAR BUT MARK MY WORDS THE FIRST WOMAN WHO FISHES FOR HIM HOOKS HIM SHE SHALL GO OFF TO MORROW THE LITTLE ARTFUL CREATURE SAID MISSUS SEDLEY WITH GREAT ENERGY
BUT THERE WAS NO LETTER DO THEY TALK THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS AT BOGGLEY WOLLAH SEDLEY ASKED OSBORNE LAUGHING POOH NONSENSE REPLIED THE SENTIMENTAL YOUTH BOUGHT EM AT NATHAN'S VERY GLAD YOU LIKE EM
AND THAT A WOMAN OF YOUR YEARS AND SIZE IS TO CATCH COLD IN SUCH AN ABOMINABLE DAMP PLACE THE CHILDREN MUST HAVE SOMEONE WITH THEM CRIED MISSUS SEDLEY LET JOE GO SAID HIS FATHER LAUGHING HE'S BIG ENOUGH
I SHALL TAKE CARE HOW I LET YOU CHOOSE FOR ME ANOTHER TIME SAID REBECCA AS THEY WENT DOWN AGAIN TO DINNER
AND IF I SHOULD SAY THAT THEY FELL IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER AT THAT SINGLE INSTANT OF TIME I SHOULD PERHAPS BE TELLING AN UNTRUTH FOR THE FACT IS THAT THESE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN BRED UP BY THEIR PARENTS FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE
BONEY HIMSELF HASN'T GOT SUCH IN HIS CELLAR MY BOY A GOBLET OF CHAMPAGNE RESTORED JOSEPH'S EQUANIMITY AND BEFORE THE BOTTLE WAS EMPTIED OF WHICH AS AN INVALID HE TOOK TWO THIRDS HE HAD AGREED TO TAKE THE YOUNG LADIES TO VAUXHALL
THE DAWN IS UP THE GUEST IS GONE THE COTTAGE HEARTH IS BLAZING STILL HEAVEN PITY ALL POOR WANDERERS LONE HARK TO THE WIND UPON THE HILL IT WAS THE SENTIMENT OF THE BEFORE MENTIONED WORDS WHEN I'M GONE
WHO HAD NEVER KNOWN HER PERFORM SO WELL SHE SANG A FRENCH SONG WHICH JOSEPH DID NOT UNDERSTAND IN THE LEAST AND WHICH GEORGE CONFESSED HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND THEN A NUMBER OF THOSE SIMPLE BALLADS WHICH WERE THE FASHION FORTY YEARS AGO
I WAS UPON MY HONOUR GOLLOP MY DOCTOR CAME IN AT ELEVEN FOR I'M A SAD INVALID YOU KNOW AND SEE GOLLOP EVERY DAY AND GAD THERE I WAS SINGING AWAY LIKE A ROBIN O YOU DROLL CREATURE DO LET ME HEAR YOU SING IT
FOR YOUR MOTHER'S SAKE DEAR MISTER SEDLEY SHE SAID
JOSEPH SEDLEY'S BACHELORHOOD WOULD HAVE BEEN AT AN END AND THIS WORK WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BUT AT THE CLOSE OF THE DITTY REBECCA QUITTED THE PIANO AND GIVING HER HAND TO AMELIA WALKED AWAY INTO THE FRONT DRAWING ROOM TWILIGHT
IN NORTH CAROLINA MONEY AND ALSO HIS DARK ORANGE COLORED INTELLIGENT AND GOOD LOOKING TURNKEY BOB SERVED HIM RIGHT IT IS NO STEALING FOR ONE PIECE OF PROPERTY TO GO OFF WITH ANOTHER PIECE REASONED A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAD HAD BUT FEW PRIVILEGES SUNDAYS AND WEEK DAYS ALIKE HE WAS KEPT PRETTY SEVERELY BENT DOWN TO DUTY HE HAD BEEN BEATEN AND KNOCKED AROUND SHAMEFULLY HE HAD A WIFE
THE FIRST ESSENTIAL STEP TOWARDS SUCCESS HE CONSIDERED WAS TO SAVE HIS MONEY AND MAKE IT AN OBJECT TO THE CAPTAIN TO HELP HIM SO WHEN HE HAD MANAGED TO LAY BY ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS HE WILLINGLY OFFERED THIS SUM TO CAPTAIN B
AND WOULD BRING ANY KIND OF FREIGHT THAT WOULD PAY THE MOST WAS THE CONDUCTOR IN THIS INSTANCE
PATIENTLY POOR TACKET BORE HIS ILLNESS EVERY MORNING WHEN HIS MASTER WENT TO SEE HIM ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT RISE HE TRIED TO SING BUT THE POWER OF PURRING LEFT HIM AS HE GOT WEAKER
I HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT CATS ARE UNFORGIVING OR THAT A FRIENDSHIP OF YEARS MAY BE CANCELLED IN A MOMENT BY AN ACCIDENTAL TREAD ON ITS TAIL OR FEET LOOK THE SAME PARTIES WILL TELL YOU
THE CAPTAIN AGREED TO THE TERMS AND FULFILLED HIS ENGAGEMENT TO THE LETTER ABOUT THE FIRST OF MARCH EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE MARY WAS PRESENTED TO THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE SHE WAS OF AGREEABLE MANNERS ABOUT FORTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE
AS HAVING BECOME SO DAILY SICK OF THE BRUTALITY AND SUFFERING HE COULD NOT HELP WITNESSING THAT HE FELT HE COULD NOT POSSIBLY STAND IT ANY LONGER LET THE COST BE WHAT IT MIGHT IN THIS STATE OF MIND HE MET WITH CAPTAIN B
AND DOESN'T CARE A RAT'S TAIL HOW SHE LOOKS WHEN A CAT'S COAT BEGINS TO APPEAR ROUGH AND STARE IT IS THE FIRST INDICATION OF APPROACHING ILLNESS AND THIS SYMPTOM
WHICH SHE EVINCES UNDER SUFFERINGS SOMETIMES THE MOST ACUTE WE TALK ABOUT DOGS BEING GAME AND TAKING THEIR DEATH EASY AND SO THEY MOSTLY DO UNDER EXCITEMENT
A REGULAR NEGRO TRADER EIGHT YEARS THIS SLAVE'S DUTIES HAD BEEN AT THE SLAVE PRISON AND AMONG OTHER DAILY OFFICES HE HAD TO ATTEND TO WAS TO LOCK UP THE PRISON
BE KIND ENOUGH TO SEND A FEW LINES TO THE LADY SPOKEN OF FOR THAT MOCKING BIRD AND MUCH OBLIGE ME WRITE ME SOON AND BELIEVE ME YOUR OBEDIENT SERV'T LOVE AND RESPECTS TO LADY AND DAUGHTER JOSEPH ROBINSON
AND MISSUS VERLOC IN HER VARIED EXPERIENCE HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SOME FOREIGNERS COULD SPEAK BETTER ENGLISH THAN THE NATIVES SHE SAID LOOKING AT THE DOOR OF THE PARLOUR FIXEDLY YOU DON'T THINK PERHAPS OF STAYING IN ENGLAND FOR GOOD
MISSUS VERLOC ROSE AND WALKING TO THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE SAID IN THE FULNESS OF HER HEART AND YOU ARE NOT TIRED OF ME MISTER VERLOC MADE NO SOUND
COVERED WITH BROWN OIL CLOTH WINNIE HIS WIFE TALKED EVENLY AT HIM THE WIFELY TALK AS ARTFULLY ADAPTED NO DOUBT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS RETURN AS THE TALK OF PENELOPE TO THE RETURN OF THE WANDERING ODYSSEUS MISSUS VERLOC HOWEVER
A CEREMONIOUS AMENITY OF ADDRESS AND COURTLINESS OF MANNER VAIN AND ANTIQUATED FORMS AT BEST PROBABLY NEVER VERY EXACTLY OBSERVED DISCARDED NOWADAYS EVEN IN THE HIGHEST SPHERES AND ALWAYS FOREIGN TO THE STANDARDS OF HER CLASS
HE WALKED STRAIGHT TO THE SOFA AND STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT HIS OVERCOAT LYING THERE AS THOUGH HE WERE AFRAID TO TOUCH IT WHAT'S THE MATTER ASKED MISSUS VERLOC IN A SUBDUED VOICE
WALKED IN BEHIND THE COUNTER SHE DID NOT LOOK OVERTLY AT THE CUSTOMER TILL SHE HAD ESTABLISHED HERSELF COMFORTABLY ON THE CHAIR BUT BY THAT TIME SHE HAD NOTED THAT HE WAS TALL AND THIN AND WORE HIS MOUSTACHES TWISTED UP
IT WAS IN ALL ESSENTIALS OF DOMESTIC PROPRIETY AND DOMESTIC COMFORT A RESPECTABLE HOME HER DEVOTED AFFECTION MISSED OUT OF IT HER BROTHER STEVIE NOW ENJOYING A DAMP VILLEGIATURE IN THE KENTISH LANES UNDER THE CARE OF MISTER MICHAELIS
SHE DID NOT LOOK FOR COURTESIES FROM HIM BUT HE WAS A GOOD HUSBAND AND SHE HAD A LOYAL RESPECT FOR HIS RIGHTS MISSUS VERLOC WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH THE PARLOUR AND ON TO HER DOMESTIC DUTIES IN THE KITCHEN
STEVIE OFFERED NO OBJECTION HE SEEMED RATHER EAGER IN A BEWILDERED SORT OF WAY HE TURNED HIS CANDID GAZE INQUISITIVELY TO MISTER VERLOC'S HEAVY COUNTENANCE AT FREQUENT INTERVALS ESPECIALLY WHEN HIS SISTER WAS NOT LOOKING AT HIM
TALKED OF THE EMBASSY TO YOU MISTER VERLOC SEEMED SCARED AND BEWILDERED BEYOND MEASURE HIS WIFE EXPLAINED YOU'VE BEEN TALKING A LITTLE IN YOUR SLEEP OF LATE ADOLF WHAT WHAT DID I SAY WHAT DO YOU KNOW
AND WITH PEACEFUL PRIDE SHE CONGRATULATED HERSELF ON A CERTAIN RESOLUTION SHE HAD TAKEN A FEW YEARS BEFORE
YOU'VE A BAD COLD IT WAS INDEED OBVIOUS THAT MISTER VERLOC WAS NOT IN HIS USUAL STATE PHYSICALLY AND EVEN MENTALLY A SOMBRE IRRESOLUTION HELD HIM SILENT FOR A WHILE
AND DAVY HURLED CENT AND NICKEL
DON'T YOU TELL ME BUT IT WAS NOT AT JANE ANNE GAZED THAT DAY IN DISMAY AND SURPRISE IT WAS AT RUBY GILLIS WHO SAT BESIDE HER IN THE CHOIR WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO RUBY
WITHOUT TRYING TO BRING THEM UP PROPERLY AND IT WAS ONLY THE PRECEDING AFTERNOON THAT SHE HAD INTERFERED TO INFLUENCE MARILLA
WAS HONESTLY ALARMED LEST HE SHOULD NEVER IN THE WORLD BE ABLE TO GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT AGAIN DARN HER EXPLODED DAVY OH DAVY DON'T SWEAR GASPED DORA IN DISMAY
ANNE TOOK THIS SECOND REJECTION WITH THE CALMNESS OF DESPAIR SHE LOCKED THE STORY AWAY IN THE GARRET TRUNK WHERE THE OLD STORY CLUB TALES REPOSED
RETORTED DAVY RECKLESSLY WELL IF YOU MUST SAY DREADFUL WORDS DON'T SAY THEM ON SUNDAY PLEADED DORA DAVY WAS AS YET FAR FROM REPENTANCE BUT IN HIS SECRET SOUL HE FELT THAT PERHAPS HE HAD GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR
SHE CEASED NOT FROM CUTTING SETS WITH MUCH ENERGY
HE GLIBLY RECITED AN OLD GOLDEN TEXT LEARNED SEVERAL WEEKS AGO FORTUNATELY MISSUS LYNDE NOW STOPPED QUESTIONING HIM BUT DAVY DID NOT ENJOY HIS DINNER
I WISH THOSE TWO BOYS HADN'T COME TONIGHT
SHE SAT PRIMLY ON A HENCOOP IN THE YARD WHILE THE OTHERS PLAYED AN UPROARIOUS GAME OF TAG AND THEN THEY ALL CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THE PIG HOUSE ROOF AND CUT THEIR INITIALS ON THE SADDLEBOARD
YES I HAVE ONLY A FEW PAGES WRITTEN BUT I HAVE IT ALL PRETTY WELL THOUGHT OUT I'VE HAD SUCH A TIME TO GET A SUITABLE PLOT
DO TO ME HE WHISPERED NOTHING DEAR YOU'VE BEEN PUNISHED ALREADY I THINK
CHANGING THE NAME OF COURSE OR ELSE MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WOULD PROBABLY THINK SHE WAS THE HEROINE
I'VE A BLUE SILK TO MAKE UP YET BUT IT'S A LITTLE HEAVY FOR SUMMER WEAR I THINK I'LL LEAVE IT UNTIL THE FALL I'M GOING TO TEACH IN WHITE SANDS YOU KNOW
IN HER LITERARY PURSUITS NOW SHE WOULD BE JUBILANT OVER A BRILLIANT IDEA NOW DESPAIRING BECAUSE SOME CONTRARY CHARACTER WOULD NOT BEHAVE PROPERLY DIANA COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MAKE THEM DO AS YOU WANT THEM TO SHE SAID
HAVE YOU NAMED ALL THE CHARACTERS ASKED DIANA WISTFULLY
AFFIXED THEIR SIGNATURES JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT THEY FELL INTO THE TRAP LAID FOR THEM FOR THE TREATY BETWEEN FRANCE AND SPAIN WAS NOT YET SIGNED AND IT WAS THE INTENTION OF THE FRENCH TO MAKE FURTHER PRETEXTS FOR DELAY IN THE HOPE THAT MONS MEANWHILE WOULD FALL
VERY RARELY COULD A BORN LEADER OF MEN HAVE BEEN MORE UNAMIABLE OR LESS ANXIOUS TO WIN POPULAR APPLAUSE BUT HIS WHOLE DEMEANOUR INSPIRED CONFIDENCE AND IGNORING THE MANY DIFFICULTIES AND OPPOSITIONS WHICH THWARTED HIM
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL MAN IN AMSTERDAM WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED HIM
ACCESSION AFTER HAVING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS PERSECUTED THE HUGUENOTS IN DEFIANCE OF THE EDICT OF NANTES TAKEN THE STEP OF REVOKING THAT GREAT INSTRUMENT OF RELIGIOUS TOLERATION ON NOVEMBER SEVENTEENTH SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE
DESPITE THE STRONG OPPOSITION HE ENCOUNTERED AT AMSTERDAM AND SOME OTHER TOWNS WHERE THE INTERESTS OF COMMERCE REIGNED SUPREME
AFTER SOME HESITATION WILLIAM WITH THE CONSENT AND APPROVAL OF THE PRINCESS DECIDED TO ACCEPT IT NO MAN EVER HAD A MORE LOYAL AND DEVOTED WIFE THAN WILLIAM THE THIRD OF ORANGE AND HE DID NOT DESERVE IT FOR SOME YEARS AFTER HIS MARRIAGE HE TREATED MARY WITH COLDNESS AND NEGLECT
HAD THE EFFECT OF INFLUENCING PUBLIC OPINION POWERFULLY IN THE STATES IN FAVOUR OF THEIR STADHOLDER'S WARLIKE POLICY
WAS NOT SLOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION
IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES EVERYTHING WAS FAVOURABLE TO AN UNDERSTANDING AND PEACE WAS CONCLUDED AT WESTMINSTER ON FEBRUARY NINETEENTH SIXTEEN SEVENTY FOUR THE TERMS DIFFERED LITTLE FROM THOSE OF BREDA EXCEPT THAT THE REPUBLIC
THE PRINCE WAS RESOLUTELY OPPOSED TO THE ENGLISH OFFER OF MEDIATION WHICH HE REGARDED AS INSINCERE AND PREMATURE
AND TO HIM THE EYES OF A LARGE PARTY IN ENGLAND WERE TURNING
THE SUPPORT OF A MAJORITY IN THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND HE USED THIS WITH EFFECT
THE FRENCH RAISED VARIOUS PRETEXTS TO DELAY THE SIGNATURE OF THE TREATY HOPING THAT MEANWHILE MONS WHICH WAS CLOSELY BELEAGUERED BY LUXEMBURG MIGHT FALL INTO THEIR HANDS AND THUS BECOME AN ASSET WHICH THEY COULD EXCHANGE FOR SOME OTHER POSSESSION
AND SCARCELY LESS THE SECURITY OF THE COMMERCE ON WHICH AMSTERDAM DEPENDED FOR ITS PROSPERITY THE SUPPORT OF AMSTERDAM SECURED THAT OF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND AND FINALLY AFTER THUS SURMOUNTING SUCCESSFULLY THE ELEMENTS OF OPPOSITION IN THE TOWN AND THE PROVINCE
ALARM AT THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE FRENCH POWER BROUGHT AT LAST BOTH SPANISH AND AUSTRIAN ASSISTANCE TO THE HARD PRESSED NETHERLANDS AND THE COURAGE AND SKILL OF DE RUYTER HELD SUCCESSFULLY AT BAY THE UNITED FLEETS OF ENGLAND AND FRANCE AND EFFECTUALLY PREVENTED THE LANDING OF AN ARMY ON THE DUTCH COAST
THERE WAS NO CARPENTER TO BE FOUND THERE HE MUST BE AT HIS HOUSE EATING HIS DINNER SUGGESTED SOLOMON JOHN HAPPY MAN EXCLAIMED MISTER PETERKIN HE HAS A DINNER TO EAT THEY WENT TO THE CARPENTER'S HOUSE
AND THE LITTLE BOYS CRIED OUT OH MAY WE GO TOO MISSUS PETERKIN SAID THAT ELIZABETH ELIZA AND THE LITTLE BOYS MIGHT GO SO MISTER PETERKIN HAD THE HORSE PUT INTO THE CARRYALL AND HE AND AGAMEMNON WENT OFF TO THEIR BUSINESS
SO NOW ALTHOUGH THE CHILDREN SAW UPON THEIR PLATES APPLE SAUCE AND SQUASH AND TOMATO AND SWEET POTATO AND SOUR POTATO NOT ONE OF THEM COULD EAT A MOUTHFUL BECAUSE NOT ONE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE MEAT
IT TASTED BAD WHAT SHOULD SHE DO OF COURSE SHE COULDN'T DRINK THE COFFEE SO SHE CALLED IN THE FAMILY
AND THEY ALL TRIED BUT THEY COULDN'T VERY WELL THEN SAID MISTER PETERKIN LET THEM GO AND ASK THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA ALL OF US CRIED ONE OF THE LITTLE BOYS IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE MOMENT YES SAID MISSUS PETERKIN
ELIZABETH ELIZA SHOOK THE REINS AND PULLED THEM AND THEN SHE CLUCKED TO THE HORSE AND MISSUS PETERKIN CLUCKED AND THE LITTLE BOYS WHISTLED AND SHOUTED BUT STILL THE HORSE WOULD NOT GO WE SHALL HAVE TO WHIP HIM SAID ELIZABETH ELIZA
AND ELIZABETH ELIZA WHO PREFERRED FAT HAD A LEAN SLICE SOLOMON JOHN WHO COULD EAT NOTHING BUT LEAN WAS HELPED TO FAT AND SO ON NOBODY HAD WHAT HE COULD EAT
UNGRATEFULLY SAID IT TASTED OF ANYTHING BUT COFFEE THE CHEMIST WAS NOT DISCOURAGED HE PUT IN A LITTLE BELLADONNA AND ATROPINE SOME GRANULATED HYDROGEN SOME POTASH
AND PLAY UPON THE PIANO THERE SO THEY TRIED THIS AND THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY SIGHT TO SEE ELIZABETH ELIZA PLAYING ON THE PIANO
AND FOUND THE CARPENTER THEY ASKED HIM TO BRING A LADDER AXES AND PICKAXE
THE PETERKINS TRY TO BECOME WISE THEY WERE SITTING ROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND WONDERING WHAT THEY SHOULD DO BECAUSE THE LADY FROM PHILADELPHIA HAD GONE AWAY IF SAID MISSUS PETERKIN
IT WAS DECIDED THAT MISTER PETERKIN SOLOMON JOHN AND THE LITTLE BOYS SHOULD GO IN SEARCH OF A CARPENTER AGAMEMNON PROPOSED THAT MEANWHILE HE SHOULD GO AND BORROW A BOOK FOR HE HAD ANOTHER IDEA
LET US TRY TO THINK WHAT SHE WOULD ADVISE US SAID MISTER PETERKIN I WISH SHE WERE HERE SAID ELIZABETH ELIZA I THINK SAID MISTER PETERKIN SHE WOULD SAY LET THEM THAT WANT TEA HAVE IT THE REST CAN GO WITHOUT
FIRST IT FLIES THEN DESPAIRS AND AT LAST BY THE VERY FORCE OF DESPERATION SOMETIMES SUCCEEDS IN ELUDING ITS PURSUERS DANGLARS MEDITATED AN ESCAPE BUT THE WALLS WERE SOLID ROCK
I LEAVE MY CAUSE WITHOUT FEAR IN YOUR HANDS KNOWING THAT YOU WILL LISTEN AND JUDGE RIGHTLY AND THAT YOU WILL SUFFER ME TO SPEAK TO THE END BEFORE YOU GIVE JUDGMENT FOR FOUR YEARS YOU O KING HAD BEEN MARRIED TO THE QUEEN AND YET HAD NO CHILDREN
AND A HANDSOMER MAN OR A MORE BEAUTIFUL HOODIE NEVER WAS SEEN THE GIRL LOVED THEM BOTH AND NEVER WISHED FOR THINGS TO BE DIFFERENT BY AND BYE THEY HAD A SON AND VERY PLEASED THEY BOTH WERE
OF WHAT MUST I REPENT STAMMERED DANGLARS OF THE EVIL YOU HAVE DONE SAID THE VOICE
THE KING OF GRANADA IS MY FATHER AND I WAS BORN IN THE PALACE WHICH OVERLOOKS THE PLAIN OF THE VEGA I WAS ONLY A FEW MONTHS OLD WHEN A WICKED FAIRY WHO HAD A SPITE AGAINST MY PARENTS CAST A SPELL OVER ME
AND SAW ONLY THE APPLE ORCHARD AS IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO AND THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL PLAYING AT BALL A SUDDEN SILENCE ROUND HIM MADE HIM LOOK UP AND HE FOUND THE EYES OF THE ASSEMBLY FIXED ON HIM IT IS TRUE
THEY SENT HIM A MAGNIFICENT SUPPER AND TOOK HIS MILLION FROM THIS TIME THE PRISONER RESOLVED TO SUFFER NO LONGER BUT TO HAVE EVERYTHING HE WANTED AT THE END OF TWELVE DAYS AFTER HAVING MADE A SPLENDID DINNER
AND THE KING WITH A GRAVE BOW TOOK HER BAND AND LED HER TO THE CHAPEL WHERE A BISHOP WAS WAITING TO PERFORM THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY
THEN SHE LOOKED ROUND FOR SOME PLACE TO REST IN AND SHE BEHELD A LITTLE HOUSE OF LIGHT BEFORE HER AND FAST SHE HURRIED TOWARDS IT AT THE DOOR STOOD A LITTLE BOY AND HER HEART WAS FILLED WITH PLEASURE AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
WHERE THE COMPANY OF YOUNG MEN REMAINED SILENT THEN HE CAME BACK HIS FACE WHITE AND STERN I TELL YOU HE SAID AND IT IS THE SOLEMN TRUTH THAT I WOULD RATHER YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT THE PRINCE WAS DEAD THOUGH HE IS MY ONLY SON
AND THE BIRD MUCH OFFENDED SPREAD HIS WINGS AND FLEW AWAY BUT THE FOLLOWING DAY HE CAME BACK AGAIN AND SAID TO THE SECOND GIRL WILT THOU WED ME FARMER'S DAUGHTER INDEED I WILL NOT ANSWERED SHE AN UGLY BRUTE IS THE HOODIE
FOR SHE HAD TO GO SOME WAY FORWARDS AND THEN THROW THE HORSE SHOES BACK FOR HIM TO PUT ON STILL AT LAST THEY WERE OVER AND THEY WENT BACK THE WAY SHE HAD COME AND STOPPED AT THE THREE HOUSES IN ORDER TO TAKE THEIR LITTLE SONS TO THEIR OWN HOME
