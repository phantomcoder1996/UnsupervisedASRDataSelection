YES ALL IS AT AN END BETWEEN US WE'VE JUST PARTED IN TEARS BUT NOT IN SILENCE JUST PARTED
BUT THIS IS GOOD BYE YOU KNOW I MUST TELEGRAPH AT ONCE TO SAY I'M COMING TO SAY YOU'RE COMING THEN I'M NOT FORGIVEN OH YOU'RE FORGIVEN IF THAT'S ANY COMFORT
WHEN THEY CAME IN THEY SAT BESIDE THE FIRE IN THE OAK DRAWING ROOM AND DARROW NOTICED HOW DELICATELY HER HEAD STOOD OUT AGAINST THE SOMBRE PANELLING AND MUSED ON THE ENJOYMENT THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE IN THE MERE FACT OF WATCHING HER HANDS AS THEY MOVED ABOUT AMONG THE TEA THINGS
IS THAT ALL HE LAUGHED RELIEVED BY HER NATURALNESS LOOK HERE
SHE COULD ALMOST HAVE SMILED AT HER SCRUPLES OF THE NIGHT BEFORE AS SHE LOOKED BACK ON THEM THEY SEEMED TO BELONG TO THE OLD IGNORANT TIMOROUS TIME WHEN SHE HAD FEARED TO LOOK LIFE IN THE FACE AND HAD BEEN BLIND TO THE MYSTERIES AND CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART BECAUSE HER OWN HAD NOT BEEN REVEALED TO HER
WHAT DOES ANYTHING MATTER BUT JUST THIS MUST I GO NOW HE ADDED ALOUD SHE ANSWERED ABSENTLY IT MUST BE TIME TO DRESS
HER RAPT PROFILE BETRAYED NO UNREST
A KNOCK ON THE DOOR MADE THEM DRAW APART
WAS ONCE FOR ALL TO TURN BACK WITH HIM TO ITS CONTEMPLATION AS SOON AS THIS DESIRE HAD GERMINATED
DARROW STOOD STILL IN THE PATH BEHIND HIM HE HEARD EFFIE'S CALL AND AT THE CHILD'S VOICE HE SAW SOPHY TURN HER HEAD WITH THE ALERTNESS OF ONE WHO IS OBSCURELY ON THE WATCH
INTENTIONS HE STOOD UP WALKED THE LENGTH OF THE ROOM AND TURNED BACK TO WHERE SHE STILL SAT MOTIONLESS
BUT SHE FELT WHAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN UNPERCEIVED BY MANY A YOUNG LADY WHO HAD TAKEN A FIRST IN CLASSICS THE INELUCTABLE FATALITY OF THE TALE THE DREAD SWAY IN IT OF THE SAME MYSTERIOUS LUCK WHICH PULLED THE THREADS OF HER OWN SMALL DESTINY
OVERTOOK EFFIE FLYING DOWN ONE OF THE LONG ALLEYS AT THE HEAD OF HER PACK BEYOND HER HE SAW MISS VINER SEATED NEAR THE STONE RIMMED BASIN BESIDE WHICH HE AND ANNA HAD PAUSED ON THEIR FIRST WALK TO THE RIVER THE GIRL COMING FORWARD AT HIS APPROACH
WHO WAS THERE IN YOUR TIME MISSUS BOLT AND MADEMOISELLE AND PROFESSOR DIDYMUS AND THE POLISH COUNTESS
BUT THE WISH ISN'T DUE TO TO ANY PAST KINDNESS ON YOUR PART BUT SIMPLY TO MY OWN INTEREST IN YOU WHY NOT PUT IT THAT OUR FRIENDSHIP GIVES ME THE RIGHT TO INTERVENE FOR WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE YOUR BENEFIT
EVERYTHING ENTERTAINED AND INTERESTED HER AND DARROW REMARKED WITH AN AMUSED DETACHMENT
FOR THE SAME SPACE OF TIME THE PAST SURGED UP IN HIM CONFUSEDLY THEN A VEIL DROPPED BETWEEN THEM HERE'S EFFIE NOW SHE EXCLAIMED HE TURNED AND SAW THE LITTLE GIRL TROTTING BACK TO THEM HER HAND IN OWEN LEATH'S
IT'S NOT A BIT LIKE YOU TO LET ANYTHING STAND IN THE WAY OF YOUR SAYING JUST WHAT YOU FEEL
HE REMAINED IMPERTURBABLY GOOD HUMOURED AND APPRECIATIVE WHILE THEY WENT THE ROUND OF THE MONUMENT AND SHE REMARKED ONLY THAT WHEN HE THOUGHT HIMSELF UNNOTICED HIS FACE GREW GRAVE AND HIS ANSWERS CAME LESS PROMPTLY
TILL LATE IN THE NIGHT HIS THOUGHTS REVOLVED IN A TURMOIL OF INDECISION HIS PRIDE WAS HUMBLED BY THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN WHAT SOPHY VINER HAD BEEN TO HIM AND WHAT HE HAD THOUGHT OF HER THIS DISCREPANCY
THEN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT AN EQUAL ACTIVITY OF INTERCOURSE WAS GOING ON OUTSIDE OF IT SOMETHING WAS IN FACT PASSING MUTELY AND RAPIDLY BETWEEN YOUNG LEATH AND SOPHY VINER
AND NOT THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN ME SINCE AND NOT THAT I'VE EVER SEEN YOU SINCE AND SHE BELIEVES YOU SHE COMPLETELY BELIEVES YOU HE UTTERED A PROTESTING EXCLAMATION AND HIS FLUSH REFLECTED ITSELF IN THE GIRL'S CHEEK
JUST AS THE FANCY SEIZED HIM
PERHAPS BECAUSE HE HAPPENED TO CATCH SIGHT OF THE OTHER BRASS PLATE OR PERHAPS BECAUSE HE WAS IN A SPITEFUL HUMOUR DARTED OFF WITH THE OLD LADY AND STOPPED AT THE RIGHT HOUSE LEAVING THE OLD GENTLEMAN TO COME PANTING ON BEHIND
AND WAITED THE ADVENT OF THE PONY AND HIS CHARGE SURE ENOUGH BEFORE LONG THE PONY CAME TROTTING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET LOOKING AS OBSTINATE AS PONY MIGHT
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN THE RESTORATION OF MISS SALLY BRASS TO THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OVER HER PERSON NOT UNMINDFUL OF THE RISK SHE RAN HOWEVER THE MARCHIONESS NO SOONER LEFT THE HOUSE THAN SHE DIVED INTO THE FIRST DARK BY WAY THAT PRESENTED ITSELF
UNTIL THE MARCHIONESS HAVING IN SOME DEGREE RECOVERED HER BREATH AND THE LOSS OF HER SHOE AND THE NOVELTY OF HER POSITION
THE PONY HAVING THOROUGHLY SATISFIED HIMSELF AS TO THE NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE FIRE PLUG LOOKED INTO THE AIR AFTER HIS OLD ENEMIES THE FLIES AND AS THERE HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THEM TICKLING HIS EAR AT THAT MOMENT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD AND WHISKED HIS TAIL
AND HOPED TO SEE SOME INDICATION OF HER PRESENCE HIS OWN EARNEST WISH COUPLED WITH THE ASSURANCE HE HAD RECEIVED FROM QUILP FILLED HIM WITH THE BELIEF THAT SHE WOULD YET ARRIVE TO CLAIM THE HUMBLE SHELTER HE HAD OFFERED AND FROM THE DEATH OF EACH DAY'S HOPE
THE PONY CAME TROTTING ROUND THE CORNER OF THE STREET LOOKING AS OBSTINATE AS PONY MIGHT AND PICKING HIS STEPS AS IF HE WERE SPYING ABOUT FOR THE CLEANEST PLACES AND WOULD BY NO MEANS DIRTY HIS FEET OR HURRY HIMSELF INCONVENIENTLY
WOKE THE BABY WHO FINDING THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY JOVIAL AND AGREEABLE IN PROGRESS WAS NO SOONER IN ITS MOTHER'S ARMS THAN IT BEGAN TO KICK AND LAUGH MOST VIGOROUSLY THIS NEW ILLUSTRATION OF HIS ARGUMENT SO TICKLED KIT
I GOT IN BEHIND REPLIED THE MARCHIONESS OH PLEASE DRIVE ON SIR DON'T STOP AND GO TOWARDS THE CITY WILL YOU AND OH DO PLEASE MAKE HASTE BECAUSE IT'S OF CONSEQUENCE THERE'S SOMEBODY WANTS TO SEE YOU THERE
YOU MIGHT HAVE CHANCED TO HEAR OF YOUR RICHARD ON HIS BIER BUT FOR THE FRIEND I SENT TO FETCH YOU ANOTHER SHAKE OF THE HAND MARCHIONESS IF YOU PLEASE SIT DOWN SIR MISTER ABEL SEEMED RATHER ASTONISHED TO HEAR OF THE QUALITY OF HIS GUIDE
THEY SURELY COULDN'T STOP AWAY MORE THAN A WEEK COULD THEY NOW THE MOTHER SHOOK HER HEAD AND REMINDED HIM HOW OFTEN HE HAD BEEN DISAPPOINTED ALREADY FOR THE MATTER OF THAT SAID KIT
I SAID I'D BE HERE SIR SAID KIT PATTING WHISKER'S NECK I HOPE YOU'VE HAD A PLEASANT RIDE SIR HE'S A VERY NICE LITTLE PONY MY
IF MATTER SO LOW COULD BE HEREIN SET DOWN KIT LEFT THE HOUSE AT AN EARLY HOUR NEXT MORNING AND SET OUT TO WALK TO FINCHLEY FEELING A SUFFICIENT PRIDE IN HIS APPEARANCE TO HAVE WARRANTED HIS EXCOMMUNICATION FROM LITTLE BETHEL FROM THAT TIME FORTH
I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU ANYTHING THANK YOU SIR KIT REPLIED AND QUITE SERIOUSLY TOO FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT SEEMED TO FREE HIM FROM THE SUSPICION WHICH THE NOTARY HAD HINTED BUT RESUMED THE OLD GENTLEMAN
KIT COULD NOT HELP FEELING PRESENTLY MISTER WITHERDEN SMELLING VERY HARD AT THE NOSEGAY CAME TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKED AT HIM AND AFTER THAT MISTER ABEL CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM
WITH THIS PURPOSE SHE SLIPPED OUT AGAIN AND CROSSING THE ROAD SAT DOWN UPON A DOOR STEP JUST OPPOSITE SHE HAD HARDLY TAKEN THIS POSITION WHEN THERE CAME DANCING UP THE STREET WITH HIS LEGS ALL WRONG AND HIS HEAD EVERYWHERE BY TURNS A PONY
THE SAME AS OURS IN THE STABLE YARD SAID JANE
YES YOU WILL MY LAMB SAID ANTHEA UNDER HER BREATH BUT IT WON'T BE AT ALL THE SORT OF THING YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IN HER HEART SHE COULD HEAR THE PRETTY SOFT LITTLE LOVING VOICE OF THE BABY LAMB SO DIFFERENT FROM THE AFFECTED TONES OF THE DREADFUL GROWN UP LAMB
AND NOW THE ODD THING WAS THAT NO ONE COULD REMEMBER ANYONE'S HAVING WISHED FOR ANYTHING THAT MORNING THE WISH ABOUT THE RED INDIANS HAD NOT STUCK IN ANYONE'S HEAD IT WAS A MOST ANXIOUS MORNING EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT HAD BEEN WISHED FOR
SHE EXPLAINED TURNING TO THE LADY WHO WITH TREMBLING HANDS WAS NOW TURNING HER BICYCLE TOWARDS THE GATE AND WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF HIM AND WE MUST GET HIM HOME BEFORE SUNSET OR I DON'T KNOW WHATEVER WILL BECOME OF US YOU SEE HE'S SORT OF UNDER A SPELL ENCHANTED YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
MY COUSIN SHE GIVE ME THE JUG FOR LUCK SHE SAID IT WAS AN ODD ONE WHAT THE BASIN OF HAD GOT SMASHED OH MARTHA
THE NEAT GREY FLANNEL SUITED GROWN UP YOUNG MAN WITH THE GREEN TIE AND THE LITTLE BLACK MOUSTACHE FORTUNATELY HE WAS SLIGHTLY BUILT AND NOT TALL STRUGGLING IN THE STURDY ARMS OF MARTHA WHO BORE HIM AWAY HELPLESS IMPLORING HIM AS SHE WENT TO BE A GOOD BOY NOW
YOU SEE HE FELT IN HIS HEART THAT IF THERE SHOULD BE INDIANS THEY WOULD BE ENTIRELY HIS OWN FAULT SO HE DID NOT WISH TO BELIEVE IN THEM AND TRYING NOT TO BELIEVE THINGS WHEN IN YOUR HEART YOU ARE ALMOST SURE THEY ARE TRUE IS AS BAD FOR THE TEMPER AS ANYTHING I KNOW
OH DEAR SAID JANE DON'T YOU THINK WE'D BETTER SURRENDER NEVER SAID ROBERT WE'LL HAVE A PARLEY IF YOU LIKE BUT WE'LL NEVER SURRENDER
NOW DO BE PERSUADED FOR YOUR OWN GOOD ASK FOR A GOOD FAT MEGATHERIUM AND HAVE DONE WITH IT THANK YOU NOT TO DAY I THINK SAID CYRIL CAUTIOUSLY WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO SAY WAS YOU KNOW HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS WISHING FOR THINGS WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AT ANYTHING
AND DE TALBOT FOR EVER ALL SUDDENLY STOPPED AND WENT OUT LIKE THE SNUFF OF A CANDLE THE LITTLE DARK ROOM SEEMED TO WHIRL ROUND AND TURN TOPSY TURVY AND WHEN THE CHILDREN CAME TO THEMSELVES
BUT AS FOR RED INDIANS WHY YOU KNOW JOLLY WELL THE WISHES ALWAYS COME THAT VERY MINUTE IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE RED INDIANS THEY'D BE HERE NOW I EXPECT THEY ARE SAID ANTHEA THEY'RE LURKING AMID THE UNDERGROWTH FOR ANYTHING YOU KNOW
AS ANTHEA WAS CROSSING THE COURTYARD FOR MORE STONES A SUDDEN AND VALUABLE IDEA CAME TO HER SHE WENT TO MARTHA AND SAID
THE GROWN UP LAMB OR HILARY AS I SUPPOSE ONE MUST NOW CALL HIM FIXED HIS PUMP AND BLEW UP THE TYRE THE PUNCTURED STATE OF IT WAS SOON EVIDENT I SUPPOSE THERE'S A COTTAGE SOMEWHERE NEAR WHERE ONE COULD GET A PAIL OF WATER SAID THE LAMB
WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN CYRIL WENT ON IMPATIENTLY WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS
THERE SEEMED SOMEHOW TO BE SOMETHING ABOUT THE FOOD THAT MADE THE IDEA OF RED INDIANS SEEM FLAT AND UNBELIEVABLE THE BOYS ACTUALLY LAUGHED AND CALLED ANTHEA A LITTLE SILLY WHY SAID CYRIL
NEVER MIND WHAT NAMES HE WAS CHRISTENED BY AND MARTHA RUSHED AT HIM AND CAUGHT HIM IN HER ARMS EXCLAIMING COME TO HIS OWN MARTHA THEN A PRECIOUS POPPET THE GROWN UP LAMB WHOSE NAMES SHALL NOW BE BURIED IN OBLIVION STRUGGLED FURIOUSLY
WHERE ARE YOU GOING OLD MAN YOU MIGHT LET BOBS AND ME COME WITH YOU EVEN IF YOU DON'T WANT THE GIRLS THIS WAS REALLY RATHER NOBLE OF CYRIL
OF COURSE THEY ARE ANTHEA POINTED CHEERFULLY THROUGH THE NARROW WINDOW
ROBERT HAD ENOUGH TO EAT AND THAT WAS SOMETHING QUIETLY BUT PERSISTENTLY THE MISERABLE FOUR TOOK IT IN TURNS TO TRY TO PERSUADE THE LAMB OR SAINT MAUR TO SPEND THE REST OF THE DAY IN THE WOODS THERE WAS NOT VERY MUCH OF THE DAY LEFT BY THE TIME HE HAD MENDED THE EIGHTEENTH PUNCTURE
WERE DISPOSED OF TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER O GOD MY EVERY HEART STRING CRIES DOST THOU THESE SCENES BEHOLD IN THIS OUR BOASTED CHRISTIAN LAND AND MUST THE TRUTH BE TOLD
BUT OF LATER YEARS HAD BEEN A LAUNDRESS OR WASHERWOMAN AND WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A WOMAN OF GREAT TASTE IN GETTING UP LINEN THE GENTLEMAN FOR WHOM SHE HAD KEPT HOUSE WAS THOMAS JEFFERSON BY WHOM SHE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS
SWEPT AWAY BY THE RAGING DISORDER THAT YEAR LIKE TOO MANY MORTON HAD BEEN DEALING EXTENSIVELY IN LANDS AND STOCKS AND THOUGH APPARENTLY IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES WAS IN REALITY DEEPLY INVOLVED IN DEBT
SEVEN HUNDRED AH GENTLEMEN THAT IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS PAPER ALSO STATES THAT SHE IS VERY INTELLIGENT EIGHT HUNDRED SHE IS A DEVOTED CHRISTIAN AND PERFECTLY TRUSTWORTHY NINE HUNDRED NINE FIFTY TEN ELEVEN
AND THE ANSWER AS THE FOLLOWING WILL SHOW DID NOT MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THE ONE WE HAVE ALREADY GIVEN WHETHER IN A CASE OF INVOLUNTARY SEPARATION OF SUCH A CHARACTER AS TO PRECLUDE ALL PROSPECT OF FUTURE INTERCOURSE THE PARTIES OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED TO MARRY AGAIN
COMPELLED TO LISTEN TO THE GROSSEST LANGUAGE AND SHRINKING FROM THE RUDE HANDS THAT EXAMINED THE GRACEFUL PROPORTIONS OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL FRAMES AFTER A FIERCE CONTEST BETWEEN THE BIDDERS THE YOUNG LADIES WERE SOLD ONE FOR TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS
AND INSTRUCTED HIM AS TO GETTING THE NEGROES READY FOR MARKET AMONGST THE FORTY NEGROES WERE SEVERAL WHOSE APPEARANCE INDICATED THAT THEY HAD SEEN SOME YEARS AND HAD GONE THROUGH SOME SERVICES
HE GOES TO BED AT NIGHT THE PROPERTY OF THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAS LIVED FOR YEARS AND GETS UP IN THE MORNING THE SLAVE OF SOME ONE WHOM HE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE
IT WAS AT ONE OF THESE PARTIES THAT HORATIO GREEN THE SON OF A WEALTHY GENTLEMAN OF RICHMOND WAS FIRST INTRODUCED TO CLOTEL THE YOUNG MAN HAD JUST RETURNED FROM COLLEGE AND WAS IN HIS TWENTY SECOND YEAR
ALL REMEDIES WERE USELESS THIS WAS THE YELLOW FEVER THE DISORDER SPREAD ALARM AND CONFUSION THROUGHOUT THE CITY ON AN AVERAGE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED DIED DAILY IN THE MIDST OF DISORDER AND CONFUSION DEATH HEAPED VICTIMS ON VICTIMS
HE NOT ONLY HAD A GOOD EDUCATION BUT WAS A MAN OF GREAT ELOQUENCE AND HAD A WONDERFUL COMMAND OF LANGUAGE HE TOO EITHER HAD OR THOUGHT HE HAD POETICAL GENIUS AND WAS OFTEN SENDING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NATCHEZ FREE TRADER AND OTHER PERIODICALS
ALTHESA ALTHOUGH AS WHITE AS MOST WHITE WOMEN IN A SOUTHERN CLIME WAS AS WE ALREADY KNOW BORN A SLAVE BY THE LAWS OF ALL THE SOUTHERN STATES THE CHILDREN FOLLOW THE CONDITION OF THE MOTHER IF THE MOTHER IS FREE THE CHILDREN ARE FREE
WERE HIS SLAVES YET SUCH WAS THE FACT AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE DISEASE WITH WHICH HENRY MORTON HAD SO SUDDENLY BEEN REMOVED HIS BROTHER WENT TO NEW ORLEANS TO GIVE WHAT AID HE COULD IN SETTLING UP THE AFFAIRS
NIGHT PASSED AWAY IN DREARINESS TO HER AND THE NEXT MORNING SHE VIEWED THE SPOT BENEATH HER WINDOW WITH THE HOPE OF SEEING THE FOOTSTEPS OF HIM WHO HAD STOOD THERE THE PREVIOUS NIGHT EVENING RETURNED AND WITH IT THE HOPE OF AGAIN SEEING THE MAN SHE LOVED
ALL TROPICAL CLIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO EPIDEMICS OF A MOST DESTRUCTIVE NATURE THE INHABITANTS OF NEW ORLEANS LOOK WITH AS MUCH CERTAINTY FOR THE APPEARANCE OF THE YELLOW FEVER SMALL POX OR CHOLERA IN THE HOT SEASON AS THE LONDONER DOES FOR FOG IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER
THIS INVISIBLE AND INCALCULABLE INFLUENCE OF PARENTAL LIFE ACTS MORE UPON THE CHILD THAN ALL THE EFFORTS OF EDUCATION WHETHER BY MEANS OF INSTRUCTION PRECEPT OR EXHORTATION
THE PROGRESS OF THE HEAT WITHIN WAS MARKED BY YELLOWISH SPOTS WHICH SPREAD OVER THE SURFACE OF THE BODY IF THEN A HAPPY CRISIS CAME NOT ALL HOPE WAS GONE SOON THE BREATH INFECTED THE AIR WITH A FETID ODOUR THE LIPS WERE GLAZED
ANSWERED THE MAN OH UNCLE JIM IS IT YES DEN YOU MUST HAVE OFF DEM DARE WHISKERS OF YOURS AN WHEN YOU GET TO ORLEANS YOU MUST GREASE DAT FACE AN MAKE IT LOOK SHINEY
BUT SHE IS IN TRUTH THE ONLY WOMAN IN LONDON TO WHOM I CAN SAY WHAT I THINK AND IT IS A COMFORT YOU KNOW TO HAVE SOME ONE IN THIS WAY THE DOMESTIC PEACE OF THE PRIME MINISTER WAS READJUSTED
WE'RE RUINED MISSUS LOPEZ AND IT'S YOUR HUSBAND HAS DONE IT WHEN WE WERE AT DOVERCOURT I TOLD YOU HOW IT WAS GOING TO BE HIS BUSINESS HAS LEFT HIM
OR IF HER TASTES LIE IN THAT DIRECTION A RICH MAN EMILY WHARTON HAD DOUBTLESS THOUGHT ABOUT THESE THINGS AND SHE SINCERELY BELIEVED THAT SHE HAD FOUND THE GOOD MAN IN FERDINAND LOPEZ
WHETHER MARRIED OR SINGLE HE WOULD HAVE PREYED UPON MISTER PARKER TO THE SAME EXTENT
MISTER FINN IS TO GO TO IRELAND GO TO IRELAND HOW DO YOU MEAN IT IS LOOKED UPON AS BEING VERY GREAT PROMOTION INDEED I AM TOLD THAT HE IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE LUCKIEST MAN IN ALL THE SCRAMBLE YOU DON'T MEAN AS CHIEF SECRETARY
YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL YOU WERE ALWAYS A GOOD GIRL BUT I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO HEAR ME THEN HE STOOD STILL WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS TROWSERS POCKETS LOOKING AT HER
THE STREETS WERE HALF MUD AND HALF SNOW AND THE POOR WOMAN WHO HAD MADE HER WAY THROUGH THE SLUSH WAS SOILED AND WET
SHE HAD ALREADY PROFESSED HERSELF WILLING TO SUBMIT TO HER FATHER'S JUDGMENT AND DID NOT NOW BY ANY MEANS CONTEMPLATE REBELLION AGAINST PARENTAL AUTHORITY BUT SHE DID FEEL THAT ON A MATTER SO VITAL TO HER
THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE JOURNEY FROM DAY TO DAY HER FATHER WOULD ASK HER WHETHER SHE HAD MADE HER INTENDED PURCHASES AND SHE WOULD TELL HIM
WHEN GOING TO MISTER WHARTON AT HIS CHAMBERS HE HAD NOT INTENDED TO CHEAT THE LAWYER INTO ANY ERRONEOUS IDEA ABOUT HIS FAMILY
WHEN A MAN SPECULATES AND DOESN'T WIN OF COURSE HE THROWS THE BLAME ON SOME ONE ELSE AND WHEN HE IS TOO MUCH OF A CUR TO COME HIMSELF HE SENDS HIS WIFE
WAS AT LAST ASSIGNED TO SIR ORLANDO DROUGHT IT WILL NEVER DO SAID MISTER RATTLER TO MISTER ROBY I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST DROUGHT WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY USEFUL MAN TO YOUR PARTY BUT HE LACKS SOMETHING OF THE POSITION
BUT THAT SHE HAD BEEN PERSISTENT IN CLINGING TO HIM
IN AMERICA I KNOW SEXTY TOLD ME HE HAS NO BUSINESS TO GO ANYWHERE WHILE HE OWES SEXTY SUCH A LOT OF MONEY HE HAS TAKEN EVERYTHING
AND MISTER ROBY HAD BEEN FORCED TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE SECRETARYSHIP AT THE ADMIRALTY BUT AS THE OLD DUKE HAD SAID THEY WERE CLOSE FRIENDS AND PREPARED TO FIGHT TOGETHER ANY BATTLE WHICH MIGHT KEEP THEM IN THEIR PRESENT POSITION
THIS IS MY FATHER MISSUS PARKER SAID EMILY PAPA THIS IS MISSUS PARKER SHE IS THE WIFE OF MISTER PARKER WHO WAS FERDINAND'S PARTNER
AROSE PARTLY FROM HER NATURE WHICH WAS THE REVERSE OF MANAGING AND PARTLY FROM A NEW EMOTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCE WITH WHICH SHE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO RECKON THE NEAR NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT HAD PRODUCED THE FRIENDSHIP OF ANNE FOR JOHN LOVEDAY
WITH HER RAMBLE IN SEARCH OF MATILDA SAT SILENT IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
YOU CAN GO AT ANY TIME AS USUAL LET HER COME WITH ME NOW MISSUS GARLAND I SHOULD BE PLEASED TO WALK ALONG WITH HER
LIKE A GOOD MANY OF THE REST FROM OUR SHIP
WHEN THEY EMERGED UPON THE ESPLANADE THE AUGUST MOON WAS SHINING ACROSS THE SEA FROM THE DIRECTION OF SAINT ALDHELM'S HEAD BOB UNCONSCIOUSLY LOITERED AND TURNED TOWARDS THE PIER REACHING THE END OF THE PROMENADE THEY SURVEYED THE QUIVERING WATERS IN SILENCE FOR SOME TIME
A VERY NICE YOUNG MASTER BAKER'S DAUGHTER HONEY A VERY WISE CHOICE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S IS SHE FAIR OR DARK HER HAIR IS RATHER LIGHT I LIKE LIGHT HAIR AND HER NAME
ANNE SCARCELY KNOWING WHAT SHE DID DESCENDED THE LADDER AND RAN TO THE BACK DOOR HASTILY UNBOLTING IT TO SAVE BOB'S TIME AND GENTLY OPENING IT IN READINESS FOR HIM SHE HAD NO SOONER DONE THIS THAN SHE FELT HANDS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER FROM WITHOUT AND A VOICE EXCLAIMING
MIDNIGHT VISITORS MISS GARLAND AND LOVEDAY WALKED LEISURELY TO THE INN AND CALLED FOR HORSE AND GIG WHILE THE HOSTLER WAS BRINGING IT ROUND THE LANDLORD WHO KNEW BOB AND HIS FAMILY WELL SPOKE TO HIM QUIETLY IN THE PASSAGE
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HE'S IN THE HOUSE HE MAY BE AND HE MAY NOT
AFORE THE PIES AND CAKES GET MOULDY AND THE BLACKPOT STALE
THROUGH STICKING SO CLOSELY TO BUSINESS THAT DAY WELL JOHN BOB HAS TOLD YOU ALL OF COURSE A QUEER
AND A LOW UNCONSCIOUS HUMMING CAME FROM ANNE IN HER DISTANT CORNER THE FAINT MELODY CONTINUED MORE OR LESS WHEN THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE SAILOR AND THE LOVEDAYS WAS RENEWED WE HEARD AFORE THAT THE VICTORY WAS NEAR KNOCKED TO PIECES SAID THE MILLER
JOHN GENTLY TRIED TO INTERCEPT HER BUT SHE PASSED HIM BY DO YOU SPEAK OF ROBERT LOVEDAY AS COURTING A WIFE SHE ASKED WITHOUT THE LEAST BETRAYAL OF EMOTION I DIDN'T SEE YOU MISS REPLIED CORNICK TURNING
TO DISTURB YE IN YOUR PRESENT FRAME OF MIND
AND DO IT HURT YOUR FEELINGS MY SON AT SUCH A TIME NO I'LL BRING MYSELF TO BEAR IT ANYHOW WHY SHOULD I OBJECT TO OTHER PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS BECAUSE I HAVE LOST MY OWN
HE TURNED ASIDE TO THE GARDEN AND WALKED DOWN THAT PLEASANT ENCLOSURE TO LEARN IF HE WERE LIKELY TO FIND IN THE OTHER HALF OF IT THE WOMAN HE LOVED SO WELL YES THERE SHE WAS
YOU KNOW MY TEMPER WHAT I SAY I MEAN HE SEATED HIMSELF FIRMLY IN THE SADDLE PLUCKED SOME LEAVES FROM THE HEDGE AND BEGAN HUMMING A SONG
YOU MAY AS WELL COME DOWN OLD BOY TWAS A SPRY JUMP AND WE GIVE YE CREDIT FOR T THE LATTER MOVEMENT OF LOVEDAY HAD BEEN A MERE FEINT PARTLY HIDDEN BY THE LEAVES HE GLIDED BACK TO THE OTHER PART OF THE TREE FROM WHENCE IT WAS EASY TO JUMP UPON A THATCH COVERED OUT HOUSE
IN NO COUNTRY WITH AN ARMY WORTH CALLING SUCH IS THERE A CHANCE FOR A MAN PHYSICALLY UNFIT TO STAY IN THE SERVICE
WHILE THE CROWD OF HANGERS ON WHO ATTENDED AND MADE UP AND PROFITED BY THE MATCHES HAD PLACED THE WHOLE BUSINESS ON A BASIS OF COMMERCIALISM AND BRUTALITY THAT WAS INTOLERABLE I SHALL ALWAYS MAINTAIN THAT BOXING CONTESTS THEMSELVES MAKE GOOD HEALTHY SPORT
THE ONLY ONLOOKERS BEING THE MEMBERS OF OUR FAITHFUL FAMILIES MY TWO PONIES WERE THE ONLY OCCUPANTS OF MY STABLE EXCEPT A CART HORSE MY WIFE AND I RODE AND DROVE THEM AND THEY WERE USED FOR HOUSEHOLD ERRANDS AND FOR THE CHILDREN AND FOR TWO AFTERNOONS A WEEK THEY SERVED ME AS POLO PONIES
THEN A CURIOUS THING HAPPENED THE PROFESSIONAL REFORMERS WHO HAD MOST LOUDLY CRITICIZED THESE BOSSES BEGAN TO CHANGE TOWARD THEM NEWSPAPER EDITORS COLLEGE PRESIDENTS CORPORATION LAWYERS AND BIG BUSINESS MEN ALL ALIKE
THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THEIR OWN FLEETS COULD PERFORM THE FEAT AND STILL LESS DID THEY BELIEVE THAT THE AMERICAN FLEET COULD I MADE UP MY MIND THAT IT WAS TIME TO HAVE A SHOW DOWN IN THE MATTER
HAVE SHOWN YOURSELVES THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE AMBASSADORS AND HERALDS OF PEACE WHEREVER YOU HAVE LANDED YOU HAVE BORNE YOURSELVES SO AS TO MAKE US AT HOME PROUD OF BEING YOUR COUNTRYMEN
OF COURSE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAD TO ARRANGE THAT OUR RETURN TO WASHINGTON SHOULD BE WHEN IT WAS DARK SO THAT OUR APPEARANCE MIGHT SCANDALIZE NO ONE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WE THUS SWAM ROCK CREEK IN THE EARLY SPRING WHEN THE ICE WAS FLOATING THICK UPON IT
WHO AT ONCE TOOK THEM TO SEE THE SIGHTS OF WASHINGTON IN THE LANDAU THE PRESIDENT'S LAND HO AS WITH SEAFARING HUMOR OUR GUESTS IMMEDIATELY STYLED IT ONCE AFTER WE WERE IN PRIVATE LIFE AGAIN
WHEN I GOT BACK TO CAMP THE OLD FELLOW WAS SITTING ON A TREE TRUNK VERY ERECT WITH HIS RIFLE ACROSS HIS KNEES AND IN RESPONSE TO MY NOD OF GREETING HE MERELY LEERED AT ME I LEANED MY RIFLE AGAINST A TREE WALKED OVER TO WHERE MY BED WAS LYING
AND SKETCHES OF THE WHITE HOUSE BY SARGENT AND BY HOPKINSON SMITH THE BOOKS ARE EVERYWHERE THERE ARE AS MANY IN THE NORTH ROOM AND IN THE PARLOR IS DRAWING ROOM A MORE APPROPRIATE NAME THAN PARLOR AS IN THE LIBRARY
BUT THAT THERE WAS NO GROUND FOR CRIMINAL PROSECUTION I LAID THEIR REPORT BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE WITH A MESSAGE IN WHICH I SAID THERE IS PROBABLY NO LAWYER OF HIGH STANDING IN THE STATE WHO
AND THERE WAS NO NATION IN THE WORLD WITH WHOM A WAR CLOUD THREATENED NO NATION IN THE WORLD WHOM WE HAD WRONGED OR FROM WHOM WE HAD ANYTHING TO FEAR THE CRUISE OF THE BATTLE FLEET WAS NOT THE LEAST OF THE CAUSES WHICH ENSURED SO PEACEFUL AN OUTLOOK
I HAVING PRACTICALLY NOTHING BUT MY BUFFALO SLEEPING BAG MY WASH KIT AND A PAIR OF SOCKS I HAD ALSO TAKEN A FLASK OF WHISKY FOR EMERGENCIES ALTHOUGH AS I FOUND THAT THE EMERGENCIES NEVER AROSE AND THAT TEA WAS BETTER THAN WHISKY WHEN A MAN WAS COLD OR DONE OUT
SAYING THAT HE WOULD ACCEPT THE POSITION HE HANDED ME THE TELEGRAM THE MAN IN QUESTION WAS A MAN I LIKED
TEN DAYS LATER AT SAGAMORE HILL I WAS AMONG MY OWN BIRDS AND WAS MUCH INTERESTED AS I LISTENED TO AND LOOKED AT THEM IN REMEMBERING THE NOTES AND ACTIONS OF THE BIRDS I HAD SEEN IN ENGLAND
THE FLAT FOOTS OF THE PENDULOUS BELLY MUSCLES ARE DELIGHTED THEY ARE LOOKING INTO THE QUESTION OF PEDOMETERS AND WILL HANG ONE OF THESE ON THEIR WHEEZY CHESTS AND LET IT COUNT EVERY SHUFFLING STEP THEY TAKE OUT OF DOORS

THESE FOLIA CAN BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE LAMINAE OF SEDIMENTARY ROCKS BY THEIR LENTICULAR FORM AND LACK OF CONTINUITY AND ESPECIALLY BY THE FACT THAT THEY CONSIST OF PLATY CRYSTALLINE GRAINS AND NOT OF PARTICLES ROUNDED BY WEAR
WHAT EFFECT HAVE THESE SHEETS ON THE PRESENT TOPOGRAPHY AND WHY ASSUMING THAT THE TRIASSIC DEFORMATION WENT ON MORE RAPIDLY THAN DENUDATION WHAT WAS ITS EFFECT ON THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE TIME ARE THERE ANY OF ITS RESULTS REMAINING IN THE TOPOGRAPHY OF TO DAY
AT THE CLOSE OF THE JURASSIC IT YIELDED TO LATERAL PRESSURE AND THE VAST PILE OF STRATA WAS CRUMPLED AND UPHEAVED INTO TOWERING MOUNTAINS THE MESOZOIC MUDS WERE HARDENED AND SQUEEZED INTO SLATES THE ROCKS WERE WRENCHED AND BROKEN

VIRGINIA WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE STARE THAT GREETED HER AND HER COMPANION AS THEY ENTERED BUT HER THOUGHT WAS DIRECTED MORE AND MORE TO THE APPROACHING SCENE WITH HER GRANDMOTHER WHAT WOULD MADAM PAGE SAY LOREEN WAS NEARLY SOBER NOW BUT SHE WAS LAPSING INTO A STATE OF STUPOR
SHE ASKED IN A COLD SNEERING VOICE THAT HURT VIRGINIA MORE THAN ANYTHING SHE HAD YET FELT YES I SAID SO VIRGINIA'S FACE FLUSHED BUT SHE SEEMED TO RECALL A VERSE THAT MISTER GRAY HAD USED FOR ONE OF HIS RECENT SERMONS
MY MONEY I MEAN GOD'S WHICH HE WANTS ME TO USE CAN BUILD WHOLESOME LODGING HOUSES REFUGES FOR POOR WOMEN ASYLUMS FOR SHOP GIRLS SAFETY FOR MANY AND MANY A LOST GIRL LIKE LOREEN
FELICIA ASKED THE QUESTION SOFTLY AND ALMOST AS IF SHE WERE ALONE QUEER ISN'T JUST THE WORD OF COURSE REPLIED ROSE INDIFFERENTLY IT WOULD BE WHAT MADAM BLANC CALLS
YOU'RE MISTAKEN I'M NOT GOING ON THE STAGE IT'S A GREAT PITY YOU'D MAKE A HIT EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT YOUR SINGING THIS TIME RACHEL FLUSHED WITH GENUINE ANGER BEFORE SHE COULD SAY ANYTHING VIRGINIA BROKE IN WHOM DO YOU MEAN BY EVERYBODY
NO ONE THOUGHT ANYTHING ABOUT IT IT WAS ALL LEGITIMATE BUSINESS WHY NOT RAYMOND ENJOYED A SYSTEM OF HIGH LICENSE AND THE SALOON AND THE BILLIARD HALL
SOMETIMES AS IN THIS CASE IT WAS MERELY A NOMINAL INQUIRY YES NO LET ME SEE IT
MY DEAR MISTER NORMAN I HASTEN TO WRITE YOU A NOTE OF APPRECIATION FOR THE EVIDENT CARRYING OUT OF YOUR PROMISE
THE SATURDAY AFTERNOON MATINEE AT THE AUDITORIUM IN CHICAGO WAS JUST OVER AND THE USUAL CROWD WAS STRUGGLING TO GET TO ITS CARRIAGE BEFORE ANY ONE ELSE
YOU CAN ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE DRIVEN YOUR GRANDMOTHER OUT OF YOUR HOUSE IN FAVOR OF A DRUNKEN WOMAN THEN WITHOUT WAITING FOR VIRGINIA TO REPLY SHE TURNED AGAIN AND WENT UPSTAIRS VIRGINIA CALLED A SERVANT AND SOON HAD LOREEN CARED FOR
WHAT'S THE LATEST NEWS FROM RAYMOND ASKED MISTER STERLING TAKING HIS CIGAR OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND LOOKING AT FELICIA WITH HALF SHUT EYES AS IF HE WERE STUDYING HER RACHEL SAYS DOCTOR BRUCE HAS BEEN STAYING IN RAYMOND FOR TWO SUNDAYS
BUT THE LETTER DIRECTED NORMAN'S ATTENTION TO THE ADVERTISING PHASE OF HIS PAPER HE HAD NOT CONSIDERED THIS BEFORE AS HE GLANCED OVER THE COLUMNS HE COULD NOT ESCAPE THE CONVICTION THAT HIS MASTER COULD NOT PERMIT SOME OF THEM IN HIS PAPER
BESIDES HOW CAN YOU ACT WITH ANY MADAM PAGE PAUSED BROKE OFF HER SENTENCE AND THEN TURNED TO RACHEL WHAT WILL YOUR MOTHER SAY TO YOUR DECISION MY DEAR IS IT NOT FOOLISH
WHEN DID YOU MOVE INTO MY PARISH WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE HOW DID YOU FIND ME SO SOON INQUIRED FELICIA WHY DON'T YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE ONLY CLEAN WINDOWS IN THE BLOCK I BELIEVE THEY ARE REPLIED FELICIA WITH A LAUGH THAT DID THE BISHOP GOOD TO HEAR
BUT AS I HAVE GOT SO FAR FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE LET IT GO ON IF YOU BREAK WITH HIM I'LL TELL HIM EVERYTHING AND THROW MYSELF INTO HIS HANDS LADY AUGUSTUS SIGHED DEEPLY I WILL MAMMA IT WAS YOU SPOTTED THIS MAN
WOULD SHE BE TAKEN ROUND TO SEE THE NEIGHBOURING TOWNS RUFFORD AND NORRINGTON LORD RUFFORD LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR RUFFORD SHE ASKED YES HE LIVED AT RUFFORD HALL THREE OR FOUR MILES FROM THE TOWN DID LORD RUFFORD HUNT
I SAY WE DID FIND IN DILLSBOROUGH WOOD WE FOUND A FOX THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY THE POOR BRUTE WAS DEAD
A RUSTIC BANQUETING HALL WAS PREPARED AND EVERYTHING WAS VERY NICE TONS OF GAME HAD BEEN KILLED AND TONS MORE WERE TO BE KILLED AFTER LUNCHEON THE DUCHESS WAS NOT THERE AND ARABELLA CONTRIVED SO TO PLACE HERSELF THAT SHE COULD BE WAITED UPON BY LORD RUFFORD OR COULD WAIT UPON HIM
THERE WERE A HUNDRED THINGS HE SAID WHICH MADE IT NECESSARY
WHEN THE PONY PAUSED AT THE BIG BROOK BROUGHT HIS FOUR LEGS STEADILY DOWN ON THE BRINK AS THOUGH HE WERE GOING TO BATHE THEN WITH A BEND OF HIS BACK LEAPED TO THE OTHER SIDE DROPPING HIS HIND LEGS IN AND INSTANTLY RECOVERING THEM
WOULD KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MISTER MORTON AND NOW SHE WAS CALLED UPON TO ANSWER THESE HORRID QUESTIONS WITHOUT A MOMENT'S NOTICE I DON'T THINK I SHALL GO WITH HIM AUNT THOUGH I AM UNABLE TO SAY ANYTHING CERTAIN JUST AT PRESENT
IS THE YOUNG LADY MISS TREFOIL I DID NOT MEAN TO MENTION ANY NAME TILL I WAS SURE IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY BUT IT IS MISS TREFOIL ELEANOR HAD TOLD ME SOMETHING OF IT
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW A MAN IS TO DO IT UNLESS IT'S BORN WITH HIM A LITTLE PRUDENCE I SHOULD SAY YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL A FELLOW THAT IT IS HIS DUTY TO BE SIX FEET HIGH BUT WHAT HAVE YOU SAID TO THE YOUNG LADY
AH YES I DARE SAY THAT WAS THE NAME I HEARD UP THERE YOU ARE NOT MISTER TWENTYMAN SIR MY NAME IS MORTON
AMONG WHOM WERE ESPECIALLY TO BE NAMED YOUNG HAMPTON AND THE ELDER BOTSEY AND LORD RUFFORD AND ABOVE ALL A DARK VISAGED LONG WHISKERED SOMBRE MILITARY MAN WHO HAD BEEN IN THE CARRIAGE WITH LORD RUFFORD
WITH A GREAT EFFORT SHE RESTRAINED ALL EMOTION AND SIMPLY SHOOK HER HEAD SHE DID IT VERY WELL AND BETRAYED NOTHING I ASK SAID THE DUCHESS BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED TO MARRY HIM LORD DRUMMOND TELLS ME THAT HE IS A MOST RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN
BECAUSE LADY USHANT IS KIND TO ME I NEEDN'T EXPECT OTHER PEOPLE TO BE SO REGINALD MORTON WAS OF COURSE THE OTHER PEOPLE THEN HE PAUSED A MOMENT I DID SO LONG HE SAID
EVERYBODY KNEW THAT SHE WAS A TREFOIL AND HER PRESENCE THEREFORE RAISED NO QUESTION THE DUCHESS OF OMNIUM WAS AMONG THE GUESTS THE DUCHESS KNEW ALL ABOUT HER AND VOUCHSAFED TO HER THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE RECOGNITION LADY CHILTERN HAD MET HER BEFORE
THE MAJOR WHO DIDN'T KNOW THE GROUND TRIED IT AT AN IMPRACTICABLE PLACE AND BROUGHT HIS MARE DOWN BUT SHE FELL AT THE RIGHT SIDE AND HE WAS QUICK ENOUGH IN GETTING AWAY FROM HER NOT TO FALL UNDER HER IN THE DITCH
NOR IS THERE THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE THAT I EVER SHALL BE SO ENGAGED SO SAYING HE TOOK UP HIS CANDLESTICK AND WALKED OFF EARLY ON THE NEXT MORNING HE SAW HIS FRIEND AND MADE SOME SORT OF LAUGHING APOLOGY FOR HIS HEAT ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING
THEN THERE CAME A SUDDEN DISRUPTION TO ALL THESE PLANS AND A SUDDEN RENEWAL OF HER HOPES TO MISSUS MASTERS
EXCLAIMED THE OLD GENTLEMAN PACING ANGRILY UP AND DOWN THE ROOM ARTHUR
CARRY HOWARD AND A GOOD MANY OF MY LITTLE FRIENDS ARE COMING YOU KNOW
AND I BELIEVE HIM I DID GO TO HIM AND HE DID NOT CAST ME OUT BUT FORGAVE MY SINS AND TAUGHT ME TO LOVE HIM AND DESIRE TO SERVE HIM ALL MY LIFE THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE GENTLEMAN AND THE LITTLE GIRL HAD DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF ALL PRESENT
HOW DARED YOU MEDDLE WITH MY WATCH I DIDN'T SIR I NEVER TOUCHED IT HE REPLIED BOLDLY YET AVOIDING HIS FATHER'S EYE AS HE UTTERED THE DELIBERATE FALSEHOOD THERE MY DEAR I TOLD YOU SO EXCLAIMED HIS MOTHER TRIUMPHANTLY
THEN SHE BEGAN TO THINK WITH A LITTLE TREMOR HOW ANGRY ARTHUR WOULD BE BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO THINK OF THAT NOW AND AFTER ALL SHE DID NOT STAND IN VERY GREAT DREAD OF THE CONSEQUENCES ESPECIALLY AS SHE FELT NEARLY SURE OF HER FATHER'S APPROVAL OF WHAT SHE HAD DONE
SAYING TO THE ELDER MISTER DINSMORE THAT HE WAS GOING TO RIDE OVER TO ION AND WOULD PROBABLY NOT RETURN BEFORE NIGHT THEN WITH A SIGH THE LITTLE GIRL WENT BACK TO HER OWN ROOM TO PREPARE HER MORNING LESSONS
AND FROM BEGINNING TO END IT GAVE EVIDENCE OF PAINSTAKING CAREFULNESS AND DECIDED IMPROVEMENT AH SURELY THIS WILL PLEASE DEAR PAPA SHE EXCLAIMED HALF ALOUD HOW GOOD AUNT ADELAIDE WAS TO SIT HERE WITH ME
ELSIE CHANGE SEATS WITH ME
HE ASKED IN A COLD GRAVE TONE YES SIR I WILL TRY TO BE A GOOD GIRL ALWAYS SAID THE HUMBLE LITTLE VOICE THEN I WILL FORGIVE YOU HE REPLIED TAKING THE HANDKERCHIEF OFF HER HAND STILL ELSIE LINGERED
DEAR DEAR PAPA IF YOU COULD ONLY KNOW HOW I LONG TO SIT THERE BUT MISSUS DINSMORE WHO HAD HASTILY RETIRED ON THE EXIT OF ARTHUR AND HIS FATHER FROM THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOW SAILING MAJESTICALLY DOWN THE HALL ON HER RETURN THITHER
HOW PRETTY YOUR HAIR IS ELSIE SAID CAROLINE WINDING THE GLOSSY RINGLETS AROUND HER FINGER I WISH YOU'D GIVE ME ONE OF THESE CURLS I WANT TO GET A BRACELET MADE FOR MAMMA AND SHE THINKS SO MUCH OF YOU AND YOUR HAIR IS SUCH A LOVELY COLOR
DO YOU DO LESSONS IN HOLIDAYS ASKED MARY LESLIE A MERRY FUN LOVING CHILD ABOUT ELSIE'S OWN AGE WHO CONSIDERED LESSONS AN INTOLERABLE BORE AND HAD SOME VAGUE IDEA THAT THEY MUST HAVE BEEN INVENTED FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF TORMENTING CHILDREN
YES PAPA IT IS BECAUSE I LOVE HIM SO SHE ANSWERED SIMPLY AND THE FATHER SIGHED AS THE THOUGHT AROSE BETTER THAN SHE LOVES ME EVEN AS SHE TOLD ME HERSELF AH I WOULD I COULD BE ALL
SO SHE MERELY RAISED HER GLAD EYES TO HIS FACE AND ANSWERED I AM VERY WELL THANK YOU PAPA BUT AFTER ALL THIS OCCURRENCE PRODUCED BUT LITTLE CHANGE IN ELSIE'S CONDITION HER FATHER TREATED HER A LITTLE MORE AFFECTIONATELY FOR A DAY OR TWO
BUT I DON'T FEEL FRIGHTENED AT THAT BECAUSE IT TELLS ME BESIDES THAT JESUS LOVES ME
ELSIE EXCLAIMED HER FATHER IN A TONE OF STERN REPROOF O PAPA HOW CAN I SHE SOBBED TREMBLING AND CLINGING TO HIS HAND AS SHE CAUGHT A THREATENING LOOK FROM ARTHUR COME COME CHILD YOU MUST TELL US ALL YOU KNOW ABOUT IT SAID HER GRANDFATHER
THIS IS A TURBAN FOR AUNT PHILLIS AND THIS IS A POUND OF TOBACCO FOR OLD UNCLE JACK AND A NICE PIPE TOO LOOK MAMMY WON'T HE BE PLEASED
AS HE TURNED HIS FLASHING EYE UPON HER
BLUSHES ARE VERY BECOMING OH YOU NEEDN'T PRETEND YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE HANDSOME YOU'RE A PERFECT LITTLE BEAUTY DO TELL ME WHERE DID YOU GET SUCH SPLENDID EYES BUT I NEEDN'T ASK FOR I HAVE ONLY TO LOOK AT YOUR FATHER TO SEE WHERE THEY CAME FROM
STUDYING AND RECITING TO HIM THEN THEY TOOK A LONG RIDE ON HORSEBACK AND WHEN THEY RETURNED SHE FOUND THAT QUITE A NUMBER OF THE EXPECTED GUESTS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AMONG THEM WAS CAROLINE HOWARD A FAVORITE FRIEND OF ELSIE'S
HOPE YOU WILL ADVISE THE ABOVE COMING SAFE TO HAND AM SORRY WE HAVE SO FEW OF YOURS YOUR FATHER SAYS HE IS AS USUAL BUT LOOKS POORLY FROM THIS EPISTLE WRITTEN IN OLD OWEN'S FORMAL STYLE
WITH SEVEN LEAGUED BOOTS OCCUPY IN THE ORDINARY NURSERY TALES AND HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE WAS IT NOT THE BLACK DOUGLAS WHO SLEW WITH HIS OWN HAND THE HEIR OF THE OSBALDISTONE FAMILY THE DAY AFTER HE TOOK POSSESSION OF HIS ESTATE SURPRISING HIM
THAT HE SCARCELY EVER MENTIONED THE RACE FROM WHICH HE SPRUNG AND HELD AS THE MOST CONTEMPTIBLE SPECIES OF VANITY THE WEAKNESS WHICH IS COMMONLY TERMED FAMILY PRIDE HIS AMBITION WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED AS WILLIAM OSBALDISTONE THE FIRST
I WAS TEMPTED FROM CURIOSITY TO DISPUTE THE GROUND WITH HIM MYSELF CONFIDING IN MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD
LED ME TO THINK THAT ANDREW ACCORDING TO THE DECENT AND MERITORIOUS CUSTOM OF HIS COUNTRYMEN HAD ASSEMBLED SOME OF HIS NEIGHBOURS TO JOIN IN FAMILY EXERCISE AS HE CALLED EVENING DEVOTION
AND CONFER ON OUR FRIEND MISTER QUITAM THE PREFERMENT OF SOLICITOR GENERAL AND HE MAY ALSO GRANT SOME GOOD DEED OR REWARD TO THIS HONEST GENTLEMAN WHO IS SITTING UPON HIS PORTMANTEAU WHICH HE PREFERS TO A CHAIR AND QUESTIONLESS
WHEN MISS VERNON CLEARED THE OBSTRUCTION AT A FLYING LEAP I WAS BOUND IN POINT OF HONOUR TO FOLLOW AND WAS IN A MOMENT AGAIN AT HER SIDE THERE ARE HOPES OF YOU YET SHE SAID I WAS AFRAID YOU HAD BEEN A VERY DEGENERATE OSBALDISTONE
HE HAD THE HARD FEATURES AND ATHLETIC FORM SAID TO BE PECULIAR TO HIS COUNTRY TOGETHER WITH THE NATIONAL INTONATION AND SLOW PEDANTIC MODE OF EXPRESSION ARISING FROM A DESIRE TO AVOID PECULIARITIES OF IDIOM OR DIALECT
THERE WAS IN THE DAYS OF WHICH I WRITE AN OLD FASHIONED CUSTOM ON THE ENGLISH ROAD WHICH I SUSPECT IS NOW OBSOLETE OR PRACTISED ONLY BY THE VULGAR JOURNEYS OF LENGTH BEING MADE ON HORSEBACK AND OF COURSE BY BRIEF STAGES
SAVOURED OF PRIESTCRAFT THE NATIVES SUCH THEY MIGHT BE WELL TERMED OF OSBALDISTONE HALL LOOKED UP TO HIM WITH MUCH MORE FEAR OR AT LEAST MORE AWE THAN AFFECTION HIS CONDEMNATION OF THEIR REVELS WAS EVIDENT FROM THEIR BEING DISCONTINUED IN SOME MEASURE
THEY BRAWLED ALONG BENEATH THE SHADE OF NATURAL COPSEWOOD WERE NOW HURRIED DOWN DECLIVITIES AND NOW PURLED MORE LEISURELY BUT STILL IN ACTIVE MOTION THROUGH LITTLE LONELY VALLEYS WHICH OPENING ON THE ROAD FROM TIME TO TIME
I PAUSED THEREFORE ON A RISING GROUND AND NOT UNMOVED BY THE SENSE OF INTEREST WHICH THAT SPECIES OF SILVAN SPORT IS SO MUCH CALCULATED TO INSPIRE
ALL OUR FAMILY RENOWN WAS ACQUIRED ALL OUR FAMILY MISFORTUNES WERE OCCASIONED BY THE NORTHERN WARS WARMED BY SUCH TALES I LOOKED UPON THE SCOTTISH PEOPLE DURING MY CHILDHOOD
BY DOING SO I OBTAINED POSSESSION SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN I SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DONE OF THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM MY FRIEND MISTER OWEN DEAR MISTER FRANCIS YOURS RECEIVED PER FAVOUR OF MISTER R OSBALDISTONE
MISTER CAMPBELL MADE NO FARTHER OBSERVATION BUT MERELY WISHED ME A GOOD JOURNEY AND THE PARTY DISPERSED FOR THE EVENING NEXT DAY I PARTED COMPANY WITH MY TIMID COMPANION
AND DRESSED IN GREEN AND RED THE UNIFORM OF A SPORTING ASSOCIATION FORMED UNDER THE AUSPICES OF OLD SIR HILDEBRAND OSBALDISTONE MY COUSINS THOUGHT I AS THEY SWEPT PAST ME THE NEXT REFLECTION WAS
THIS PIECE OF GRATUITOUS INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ROUTE HE PROPOSED TO HIMSELF THE FIRST I HAD HEARD MY COMPANION BESTOW UPON ANY ONE FAILED TO EXCITE THE CORRESPONDING CONFIDENCE OF THE SCOTCHMAN WE CAN SCARCE TRAVEL TOGETHER HE REPLIED DRILY
AS FAST AS FAST MIGHT BE
AND INQUIRED OF EVERYONE WHERE THE FINEST JEWELS WERE TO BE GOT BUT THOUGH HE SOUGHT NIGHT AND DAY HE NEVER FOUND ONE TO COMPARE WITH THE ANKLET AT LAST ONLY A WEEK REMAINED AND HE WAS IN SORE DIFFICULTY WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE FAIRY OF THE FOREST
WAS BUILT ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF A FOREST AND AS THEY HAD NO NEIGHBOURS THE PLACE WAS VERY LONELY AND THE BOY WAS KEPT AT HOME BY HIS MOTHER TO BEAR HER COMPANY THEY WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON A WINTER'S EVENING WHEN A STORM SUDDENLY SPRANG UP
AND AS THEY DREW NEAR IT AMEER ALI BEHELD IN THE DOORWAY THE LOVELIEST DAMSEL HIS EYES HAD EVER LOOKED ON AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGER SHE DREW HER VEIL ABOUT HER AND STEPPED INTO THE HUT AND MUCH AS HE WISHED TO SEE HER AGAIN
BUT JUST AS HE WAS ABOUT TO WITHDRAW HIS PROPOSAL THE ARAB WHISPERED FEAR NOTHING BUT TAKE HER THE LUCK MUST CHANGE SOME TIME HE SAID AT LAST
BUT THAT HE WOULD NEVER DO OH YES THAT IS EASY ENOUGH CRIED THE PRINCESS DELIGHTED TO THINK THAT AFTER ALL THEY NEED NOT BE PARTED AND SHE RAN OFF TO FIND HER FATHER AND BEG HIM TO MARRY THE LADY AT ONCE
TOOK A STEP INTO THE WATER AND CAUGHT THE LEAF AS IT WAS SAILING BY HE OPENED IT AND WITHIN HE FOUND A LOCK OF HAIR LIKE SPUN GOLD AND FROM WHICH CAME A FAINT EXQUISITE ODOUR
THEY SPLASHED JOYFULLY ABOUT AND SHOOK THEMSELVES AND THEN DIVED TO THE BOTTOM OF A DEEP POOL WHEN THEY APPEARED AGAIN THEY WERE NO LONGER THREE DOVES BUT THREE BEAUTIFUL DAMSELS
WHILST JACKALS HUNT IN EVERY PLACE WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE PICKED UP
WALKING GRANDLY ABOUT WITH HER TREASURE TIED ROUND HER ANKLE SHE HEARD THE STARLING SAY TO THE PARROT
MIND YOU DECLARE THAT THE KING IS RIGHT IT CERTAINLY WAS A JACKAL BUT IF WE SAY SO THE KING WILL PROBABLY NOT KEEP HIS WORD ABOUT GOING AWAY AND WE SHALL GET INTO TROUBLE SO WE HAD BETTER TAKE HIS SIDE TO THIS THE OTHER AGREED
HE HAD MANY TIMES PROVED THAT HIS MOTHER WAS WISER THAN HE SO HE PROMISED OBEDIENCE AFTER A VOYAGE OF SEVERAL WEEKS HE ARRIVED AT THE ISLAND OF WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SPOKEN IT WAS FULL OF HILLS AND WOODS AND FLOWERS AND BEAUTIFUL WHITE HOUSES STOOD EVERYWHERE IN GARDENS
PROMISE ME THAT WHATEVER OUR DAUGHTER ASKS YOU WILL DO NO MATTER WHETHER YOU WISH TO OR NOT THE KING AT FIRST HESITATED BUT AS SHE ADDED UNLESS YOU PROMISE THIS I CANNOT DIE IN PEACE
TILL ITS FELLOW WAS BROUGHT BEFORE HIM WHEN THEY HEARD THIS THE JEW AND THE BOY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND THEIR EYES SAID WHERE ARE WE TO GO TO FIND THE OTHER ONE BUT AS THEY KNEW THERE WAS NO USE IN DISPUTING THE DECISION
AND MAY I ASK WHAT IMPORTANT BUSINESS TAKES YOU THERE ASKED THE LITTLE WOMAN WHO WAS REALLY A WITCH MY HOUSE IS SO DREARY WITH NO ONE TO SPEAK TO I CANNOT STAY IN IT ALONE AND I AM SEEKING FOR A CHILD I DON'T MIND HOW SMALL SHE IS WHO WILL KEEP ME COMPANY
THEN THE PRINCESS SENT FOR HER FATHER AND TOLD HIM THAT SHE WISHED TO MARRY AMEER ALI
FOR SHE DID NOT LIKE SNAKES BUT THE LITTLE BIRD PAID NO HEED PUT THEM IN A BASKET AND GO TO THE GREEN KNIGHT'S PALACE SAID SHE AND WHAT AM I TO DO WITH THEM WHEN I GET THERE SHE CRIED BLUSHING ALL OVER THOUGH THERE WAS NO ONE TO SEE HER BUT THE BIRD
THAT HIS DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND WAS NOT MERELY THE GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE AS HE HAD SUPPOSED BUT THE KING OF A POWERFUL COUNTRY HE AT ONCE ORDERED A SPLENDID SHIP TO BE MADE READY
BUT HE HATED THE SUN AND THE TREES AND THE FLOWERS AND ALL THAT MAIA LOVED BEST TO BE SURE BEING BLIND HE HAD NEVER SEEN THEM AND LIKE MANY OTHER PEOPLE HE THOUGHT THAT ANYTHING HE DID NOT KNOW WAS NOT WORTH KNOWING BUT MAIA'S TALES AMUSED HIM
WITHOUT REALIZING IT SHE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE INTO THE PARK AND PAUSING TO ADMIRE A BIT OF DISTANT VIEW THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO GET FROM A SLIGHTLY ELEVATED POINT SHE LINGERED A MOMENT OR TWO LONGER
I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF WE SHOULD HAVE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GIVE TO MISSUS ROSA DON'T COUNT YOUR CHICKENS TOO SOON BRENDA SAID BELLE SUPPOSE IT SHOULD RAIN ON THE DAY OF THE SALE OR SUPPOSE OH
YOU'RE TERRIBLY NARROW NORA TO THINK THAT NOBODY'S ANY GOOD UNLESS HE COMES FROM BOSTON I DIDN'T SAY SO REPLIED NORA NO BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN AND I'M SURPRISED PHILIP BLAIR
I AM SURE THAT WE HAD ALL THE TIME WE WISHED
BELLE DISCREETLY SAID NOTHING FURTHER FOR SHE HAD LEARNED THAT WHEN NORA ASSUMED THIS POSITIVE TONE BRENDA WAS APT TO GO OVER ON HER SIDE AND THEN BELLE HERSELF WOULD BE SO IN THE MINORITY AS TO BE OBLIGED TO SEEM AN UNPOPULAR PERSON
SO THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE KEPT IT WITH HER FOR A DAY OR TWO WHILE FINDING THE OWNER O IF ONLY IT HAD NO OWNER WHAT JOY SHE THOUGHT AS SHE GAZED INTO ITS DARK EYES TO KEEP IT FOR MYSELF
AND IT ISN'T EVEN ARTISTIC OR OH WELL NORA REPLIED THIS IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE DONE I KEEP IT TO WORK ON HERE BUT I HAVE FINISHED A SMALL SHAWL AT HOME AND A PAIR OF BABY'S SHOES
AN ATTENTION THAT ANY ONE COULD SEE WAS NOT A MERE PRETENCE PHILIP BLAIR HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CONFIDE TO HER A LARGER SHARE OF HIS COLLEGE WOES
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER HAVE US USE TOBACCO POUCHES THAN SMOKE THESE UNWHOLESOME CIGARETTES YOU SHOULDN'T USE TOBACCO AT ALL CRIED EDITH IN A PLAINTIVE TONE AT YOUR AGE PHILIP YOU KNOW HOW MAMMA FEELS ABOUT IT DON'T BE A GOOSE EDITH RETORTED PHILIP
MISSUS BLAIR AND MISSUS BARLOW WERE ALSO READY TO ADVISE THEIR DAUGHTERS
RESPONDED HER MOTHER I DO WISH THAT YOU WOULD TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THE AFFAIRS OF YOUR OWN CITY HERE IS JULIA WHO HAS BEEN IN BOSTON BUT A SHORT TIME
RUTH AND WILL HAD MET SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THE BALL GAME AND ALTHOUGH THE FOUR HAD NOT YET DISCOVERED IT THESE TWO YOUNG PERSONS HAD BEGUN TO TAKE CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN EACH OTHER YOU WOULDN'T PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT QUERIED RUTH
INDEED HE ANSWERED YOU SURPRISE ME
YET DURING THEIR CALL HOW MANY THINGS THEY HAD TO SEE AND TO REMEMBER HE LET EACH OF THEM HOLD FOR A MOMENT THE GOLD PEN WITH WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN ELSIE VENNER AND THE AUTOCRAT PAPERS
TO WHOM THE REMARK HAPPENED TO BE MADE
THE SURPRISE TABLE HAD BEEN AN IDEA OF BELLE'S AND WAS A RATHER AGREEABLE CHANGE FROM THE USUAL GRAB BAG ALL KINDS OF LITTLE THINGS TOYS NOVELTIES LIKE THOSE USED AS GERMAN FAVORS SMALL BOOKS AND PHOTOGRAPHS
THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF DISCUSSING JULIA'S PECULIARITIES OTHER PERSONS DID NOT FIND JULIA PECULIAR TO OLDER PEOPLE SHE SEEMED AN ESPECIALLY WELL MANNERED GIRL WITH A DELIGHTFUL VEIN OF THOUGHTFULNESS THAT WAS NOT TOO OFTEN MET IN YOUNG GIRLS
SAW A COMPENSATION FOR THE EXCITEMENT OF THIS LAST WEEK OR TWO IN THE FACT THAT HER DAUGHTER HAD SHOWN MORE PERSEVERANCE THAN SHE HAD GIVEN HER CREDIT FOR MISSUS BARLOW WAS ESPECIALLY PLEASED WITH THE GOOD SPIRIT THAT HER NIECE JULIA HAD SHOWN
AND SHE WAS NOT HALF SO WELL INFORMED ON SPORTS AND GAMES AS WERE THE GIRLS WHO HAD LIVED ALL THEIR LIVES IN BOSTON BUT SHE HAD A WAY OF LISTENING ATTENTIVELY TO WHATEVER ANY BOY HAPPENED TO BE SAYING TO HER AND THE QUESTIONS THAT SHE ASKED ALWAYS SHOWED AN UNUSUAL DEGREE OF ATTENTION
I DID NOT MEAN TO STAY THE WHOLE AFTERNOON OH DON'T GO URGED EDITH IF YOU'LL WAIT HALF AN HOUR I WILL GO WITH YOU BUT I MUST FINISH THIS PIECE OF DRAWN WORK BUT BELLE CONTINUED TO PUT ON HER OUTER WRAPS
HE SPOKE THE WORDS WITH SINGULAR FEELING TRULY THOUGH MISTER NOAKES SHE SAID IN A STRAIGHTFORWARD MANNER YOU ARE TOO BUSY MISSUS MAX SAYS YOU ARE TO BREAK OUT BREAK OUT WITH THE MEASLES IF NOTHING ELSE WILL INTERRUPT YOU AND YOU ARE TO HAVE TEA WITH HER THIS AFTERNOON
AND CARRIED THE MACHINE TO THE FARTHEST CORNER OF THE ROOM THERE WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF AND TENSE AND ALMOST TERRIBLE ANTICIPATION
SPLINTERED WOOD METAL HURTLING THROUGH AIR BLEEDING HANDS LACERATED BREASTS SIGHTLESS EYES THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH HIGH EXPLOSIVES HE HALF GROANED HE TURNED AWAY FROM THE STAND AND WENT TO THE SINGLE WINDOW THAT LIT THE ROOM
AND ALL THAT MADE FOR THE WORLD'S GOOD AND HAPPINESS SHOULD BE SO WANTONLY EXTINGUISHED BUT THAT NO TOUCH OF THE VANISHED HAND SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO THE ONE SOUL NOW LEFT BEHIND WITH WHOM HIS SOUL HAD BEEN FUSED
IT WOULD BECOME IMBUED WITH MARVELOUS POSSIBILITY A THING FOR WHICH ROYAL MILITARY BUREAUS IMPERIAL NAVIES WOULD PAY A GREAT PRICE A TWIST OF THE LEVER WOULD DO IT YET HOW ALIKE AND EWELL WAS MAD
WITH A COMFORTABLE FEELING OF GOOD BUSINESS ABOUT IT HE FELT BETTER AND BETTER FROM SOMEWHERE A SAYING FLOATED INTO HIS HEAD DOING GOOD UNTO OTHERS IS THE ONLY HAPPINESS BY HECK THAT'S TRUE HE COMMENTED ALOUD
WHILE SHE SPOKE SHE TOOK OFF HER HAT AND SMOOTHED HER HAIR I'M BLOWN TO PIECES I DROVE CORNISH THIS MORNING HE GOT BY EVERYTHING ON THE WAY HE ACTED LIKE A PREMIERE DANSEUSE WHEN I PASSED THE COOPER'S SHOP HIS JOY AT SEEING HER WAS DISCOUNTENANCED BY HIS FEAR FOR HER
AND HE WAS AFRAID OF HER HER INSINUATED TRUST IN HIM THREW INTO MURKY RELIEF THE AFFAIR WHICH OCCUPIED HIM WHEN SHE TURNED TO HIM A FLUSHED JOYFUL FACE AND GRAY EYES CLEAR AND UNSULLIED IT FLASHED INTO HIS SOUL
GOOD MORNING MISTER MAXINEFF SAID NOAKES TURNING SLOWLY THE RACKET SOME HALF BAKED FULMINATE I PUT IN THE DITCH OUT THERE AN HOUR AGO SO LONG SINCE SAID THE OLDER MAN ADVANCING TOWARD THE WINDOW
WELL IF YOU'LL MAKE IT FIVE PLUNKS AND GIVE ME YOUR TICKET YOU CAN TAKE THIS HORSE AN I'LL GO ROUND BY TRAIN SAY DO YOU WANT TO CARGAN WAS TEMPTED
SOON HE WAS DESCENDING THE VILLAGE STREET KEEPING PACE WITH HIS RAPID THOUGHTS FROM THE EXCHANGE HE DISPATCHED A MESSENGER TO THE HOUSE A HALF MILE AWAY HE DRESSED QUICKLY THE WHILE READING REPEATEDLY HIS FOREIGN LETTER
WHAT'LL I DO WITH MY SUIT CASE GIMME IT TO TAKE FOR YOU I GUESS IT AIN'T WORTH MORE'N MY HORSE
AND THE THOUGHT OF THEIR LITTLE SITTING ROOM AND THE KIDS PLAYING BEHIND HER WARMED HIS BLOOD I GOT RUN AWAY WITH ON THE PLAINS BUT I'M ALL RIGHT HER FRIGHTENED EJACULATION THRILLED HIM WITH LOVING PRIDE
HER FACE WAS TROUBLED AND WHEN THEY REACHED THE MOTOR SHE CAUGHT HER HUSBAND'S ELBOW GENTLY AS IF TO ASK HIM SOMETHING BUT HE MERELY NODDED AND TURNED HER GLANCE TOWARD CARGAN'S WINDOW SHE BOWED AND SMILED VERY SWEETLY IN HIS DIRECTION
I AM GLAD MY FAMILY IS NOT SO ANXIOUS TO THRUST ME OFF AS MY FRIENDS ARE AND YOU ARE UNWILLING TO BE THRUST OFF AS YOU PUT IT MARRIED NO NOT UNWILLING UNPREPARED IT IS SO VERY FINAL YOU KNOW A WOMAN GIVES UP EVERYTHING
CARGAN SHIFTED UNEASILY IN HIS SADDLE AND TRIED TO THINK OF BUSINESS BUT INSTEAD OF BUSINESS QUEER CHILDISH IDEAS BEGAN FLOATING IN AND OUT OF HIS MIND ACCOMPANIED BY WORDS REMEMBERED FROM SUNDAYS IN HIS BOYHOOD HE WAS ALONE WITH GOD
IN THE MIRROR OF THE SODA FOUNTAIN HE SAW HIMSELF TORN DIRTY SHRINKING AND THE SIGHT FILLED HIM WITH DISGUST AND ANGER HE FELT AS RIDICULOUS AS WHEN HE HAD COME OUT WITH A GLASS TOO MUCH FROM THE STONEHAM BAR AND TRIPPED OVER THE STEPS OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE
