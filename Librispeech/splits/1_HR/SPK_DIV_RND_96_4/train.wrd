OH THERE'S NO MISTAKING HIS POSITION THAT HE MOVES IN THE HIGHER CLASSES THERE'S NO DOUBT THE CAB DROVE AWAY AND I GOT UP BEHIND IT THE DRIVER THOUGHT BOYS WERE THERE AND TURNED HIS HEAD AND HIS WHIP BUT I MADE HIM A SIGN
I DIE TO SEE HIM MISTER MORLAND YOU ARE NOT TO LISTEN WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU BUT WHAT IS ALL THIS WHISPERING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON THERE NOW I KNEW HOW IT WOULD BE
SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING VEXED AT THE NON APPEARANCE OF MISTER THORPE FOR SHE NOT ONLY LONGED TO BE DANCING BUT WAS LIKEWISE AWARE THAT AS THE REAL DIGNITY OF HER SITUATION COULD NOT BE KNOWN
NOW I TRAVEL A GREAT DEAL PARTICULARLY ON THIS ROAD AND I WISH TO SEE ALL INNKEEPERS MAKING A FORTUNE IT SEEMS TO ME SAID THE HOST THAT THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF SEEING MONSIEUR BAH I HAVE PASSED PERHAPS TEN TIMES THROUGH CHANTILLY
WHEREAS THE STRANGER ON THE CONTRARY IN SPITE OF ALL HIS RODOMONTADES QUICKLY THREW HIM ON HIS BACK AS MONSIEUR PORTHOS IS A VERY BOASTFUL MAN HE INSISTS THAT NOBODY SHALL KNOW HE HAS RECEIVED THIS WOUND EXCEPT THE DUCHESS
AH MONSIEUR YOU INFUSE GENUINE BALM INTO MY BLOOD WE HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE ADVANCES AND THIS VERY MORNING THE SURGEON DECLARED THAT IF MONSIEUR PORTHOS DID NOT PAY HIM HE SHOULD LOOK TO ME AS IT WAS I WHO HAD SENT FOR HIM PORTHOS IS WOUNDED THEN
MONTE CRISTO REMAINED AS UNMOVED AS IF THE REPROACH HAD NOT BEEN ADDRESSED TO HIM ALBERT AT THIS MOMENT RAN IN OH MOTHER HE EXCLAIMED SUCH A MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED WHAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED ASKED THE COUNTESS
BE FAITHFUL AND NOT BLIND IN DOING THAT AS JEPHTHAH WAS IN HIS FIRST OFFERING WHOM MORE BESEEMED TO SAY I HAVE DONE WRONG THAN TO DO WORSE BY KEEPING
MUST BE PERFORCE THE FRUITS OF FORMAL PRINCIPLES AND THESE SAVE ONE OF COURSE WOULD BY THY REASONING BE DESTROYED BESIDES IF RARITY WERE OF THIS DIMNESS THE CAUSE THOU ASKEST
BECAUSE THEY CORUSCATE WHEN THOU DOST SMILE BUT KNOW NOT WHO THOU ART NOR WHY THOU HAST SPIRIT AUGUST THY STATION IN THE SPHERE THAT VEILS ITSELF TO MEN IN ALIEN RAYS
I WAITED A FEW MOMENTS EXPECTING HE WOULD GO ON WITH THE SUBJECT FIRST BROACHED BUT HE SEEMED TO HAVE ENTERED ANOTHER TRAIN OF REFLECTION HIS LOOK DENOTED ABSTRACTION FROM ME AND MY BUSINESS
REGRETS TO WHICH I HAVE LATTERLY AVOIDED REFERRING BUT WHICH POSSESSED ME AND TYRANNISED OVER ME RUTHLESSLY MEANTIME A MONTH WAS GONE
AND THEY LIVED ALL ALONE IN A LITTLE HUT AWAY AT THE END OF THE VILLAGE STREET FOR TOM'S MOTHER HAD DIED WHEN HE WAS A BABY YOU MAY NOT SUPPOSE THAT TOM WAS A VERY GOOD BOY SINCE HE HAD SUCH A QUEER FATHER BUT NEITHER WAS HE VERY BAD
I SHALL SURPRISE YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID ROSE NATURALLY EMBARRASSED BUT YOU ONCE SHOWED GREAT BENEVOLENCE AND GOODNESS TO A VERY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND OF MINE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL TAKE AN INTEREST IN HEARING OF HIM AGAIN
BUT WHAT IS THIS OF WHOM DO YOU SPEAK I HAVE SEEN THE GENTLEMAN REPLIED OLIVER SCARCELY ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS SO GOOD TO ME MISTER BROWNLOW THAT WE HAVE SO OFTEN TALKED ABOUT WHERE ASKED ROSE
RESERVING NANCY'S INFORMATION FOR THAT GENTLEMAN'S PRIVATE EAR AND CONCLUDING WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HIS ONLY SORROW FOR SOME MONTHS PAST HAD BEEN NOT BEING ABLE TO MEET WITH HIS FORMER BENEFACTOR AND FRIEND THANK GOD SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN
ZEBRA THE CROOK AMONG HORSES CONDEMNED TO WEAR STRIPES FOR LIFE ZERO ORIGINALLY NOTHING BUT NOW MEANING A GOOD DEAL ON A THERMOMETER OR BANK DRAFT AND COMPRISING TWO THIRDS OF THE FOUR HUNDRED
THREE LEVEL TEASPOONS OF BAKING POWDER AND A FEW GRAINS OF SALT ADD ONE CUP OF MILK ONE WELL BEATEN EGG THREE TABLESPOONS OF MELTED BUTTER AND A TEASPOON OF VANILLA OR LEMON FLAVORING
A QUALITY OF MIND THAT RESTRAINS THE WISE BOARDER FROM TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW HIS LANDLADY MAKES HER HASH PRUDERY A QUALITY THAT DISPLAYS A LACK OF MODESTY AS A WIG DOES A LOSS OF HAIR PRUNE
ADD TO THE BUTTER AND SUGAR WITH ONE CUP OF MILK AND THREE CUPS OF FLOUR IN WHICH FOUR LEVEL TEASPOONS OF BAKING POWDER HAVE BEEN SIFTED THE STIFFLY BEATEN WHITES OF FIVE EGGS AND TWO TEASPOONS OF VANILLA FLAVORING AND TWO SQUARES OF CHOCOLATE MELTED
MORE INTENSE THAN THE PROCESS OF TRANSFORMATION IN THE EXISTING TISSUES IF BOTH PROCESSES WERE EQUALLY ACTIVE THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY COULD NOT INCREASE AND WERE THE WASTE BY TRANSFORMATION GREATER THE WEIGHT OF THE BODY WOULD DECREASE
THE PRECEDING CONSIDERATIONS LEAVE NO DOUBT AS TO THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH NATURE HAS ADDED TO THE FOOD OF THE YOUNG OF CARNIVOROUS MAMMALIA SUBSTANCES DEVOID OF NITROGEN
BY CONTACT AND ATTACHMENT TO THE SURFACE AND BY ACTUAL MOVEMENT ROUND THE PERIPHERY ITSELF MAN HIMSELF LIKEWISE IS VIEWED IN ONE WAY BY SENSE IN ANOTHER BY IMAGINATION IN ANOTHER WAY AGAIN BY THOUGHT
STRANGE NOTIONS HAS HE SAID THE OLD MAN AH THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THAT SENDING TO SCHOOL IN THESE DAYS IT ONLY DOES HARM
AND EXHAUSTED STATE TO CONTEMPLATE THEIRS NOT A BOUGH IN THE NINE TREES WHICH COMPOSED THE GROUP BUT WAS SPLINTERED LOPPED AND DISTORTED BY THE FIERCE WEATHER THAT THERE HELD THEM AT ITS MERCY
ON ITS WAY TO THE SQUARE BIT OF SKY AT THE TOP FROM WHICH THE DAYLIGHT STRUCK DOWN WITH A PALLID GLARE UPON THE TATTERS OF SOOT DRAPING THE FLUE AS SEAWEED DRAPES A ROCKY FISSURE SHE REMEMBERED
HE SET OFF AS HARD AS HE COULD JERRY PATTED ME ON THE NECK NO JACK A SHILLING WOULD NOT PAY FOR THAT SORT OF THING WOULD IT OLD BOY ALTHOUGH JERRY WAS DETERMINEDLY SET AGAINST HARD DRIVING
JERRY BARKER I NEVER KNEW A BETTER MAN THAN MY NEW MASTER HE WAS KIND AND GOOD AND AS STRONG FOR THE RIGHT AS JOHN MANLY AND SO GOOD TEMPERED AND MERRY THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE COULD PICK A QUARREL WITH HIM
IF YOU WANT TO GET THROUGH LONDON FAST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY IT WANTS A DEAL OF PRACTICE JERRY AND I WERE USED TO IT AND NO ONE COULD BEAT US AT GETTING THROUGH WHEN WE WERE SET UPON IT I WAS QUICK AND BOLD
AS A DIFFERENCE IN JUDGMENT FROM MYSELF OR A DEVIATION FROM WHAT I MAY THINK RIGHT AND CONSISTENT YOU SPEAK VERY PROPERLY WILLOUGHBY CERTAINLY DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE SUSPECTED
SUCH CARELESSNESS OF THE FUTURE AS YOU ATTRIBUTE TO HIM YOU MUST REMEMBER MY DEAR MOTHER THAT I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED THIS MATTER AS CERTAIN I HAVE HAD MY DOUBTS I CONFESS BUT THEY ARE FAINTER THAN THEY WERE
AND THIS WAS SUCH A DAY I COULD NOT HELP GOING TO HIM UP IN HIS ROOM BEFORE WE SET OFF TO ADVISE HIM NOT TO VENTURE HE WAS PUTTING ON HIS WIG SO I SAID COACHMAN
BUT THOUGHT THAT BURNE AND FRED WERE TWO VARSITY SPORTS SHOWING THEIR GIRL A COLLEGIATE TIME PHYLLIS'S FEELINGS AS SHE WAS PARADED BY THE HARVARD AND PRINCETON STANDS WHERE SAT DOZENS OF HER FORMER DEVOTEES CAN BE IMAGINED SHE TRIED TO WALK A LITTLE AHEAD
THEY TALKED UNTIL THREE FROM BIOLOGY TO ORGANIZED RELIGION AND WHEN AMORY CREPT SHIVERING INTO BED
PHYLLIS HAD PINNED HIM DOWN AND SERVED HIM UP
I HATE THE DARK AMORY OBJECTED I DIDN'T USE TO EXCEPT WHEN I WAS PARTICULARLY IMAGINATIVE BUT NOW I REALLY DO I'M A REGULAR FOOL ABOUT IT THAT'S USELESS YOU KNOW QUITE POSSIBLY
ALMOST OUT LOUD FORGETTING THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY WOULD HEAR HER DON'T STAND THERE CHATTERING TO YOURSELF LIKE THAT HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID LOOKING AT HER FOR THE FIRST TIME
I WENT AND SHOUTED IN HIS EAR HUMPTY DUMPTY RAISED HIS VOICE ALMOST TO A SCREAM
I SEE WELL THAT YOU ARE BOTH FOR USE AND ORNAMENT
EVIDENTLY ADDRESSED TO A TREE SO SHE STOOD AND SOFTLY REPEATED TO HERSELF HUMPTY DUMPTY SAT ON A WALL HUMPTY DUMPTY HAD A GREAT FALL ALL THE KING'S
HIS LIFE WAS VERY REGULAR
THE HAPPY THOUGHT STRUCK HIM OF CONSULTING PSMITH IT WAS HIS HOUR FOR POTTERING
WHO HAD GENERALLY SOME FRESH GRIEVANCE AGAINST THE RING WEARING BRISTOW TO AIR FROM ELEVEN TO HALF PAST TWELVE HE WOULD PUT IN A LITTLE GENTLE WORK LUNCH
OH MAMMA DO THE PEOPLE HEREABOUTS KNOW I AM MARRIED TO DAY I WAS AFRAID THEY MIGHT NOT AND WE OVERTOOK WILLIAM GOULDING IN HIS CURRICLE
RESULTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT I COMMENCED WITH THE SIMPLEST AND MOST GENERAL TRUTHS AND THAT THUS EACH TRUTH DISCOVERED WAS A RULE AVAILABLE IN THE DISCOVERY OF SUBSEQUENT ONES
PERCEIVING FURTHER THAT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THESE RELATIONS I SHOULD SOMETIMES HAVE TO CONSIDER THEM ONE BY ONE AND SOMETIMES ONLY TO BEAR THEM IN MIND OR EMBRACE THEM IN THE AGGREGATE
THAT I CANNOT IN ANY DEGREE APPROVE OF THOSE RESTLESS AND BUSY MEDDLERS WHO CALLED NEITHER BY BIRTH NOR FORTUNE TO TAKE PART IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS ARE YET ALWAYS PROJECTING REFORMS
AND THE COOK WADDLING AFTER THEM THEN SAID LINA FUNDEVOGEL NEVER LEAVE ME AND I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU THEN SAID FUNDEVOGEL NEITHER NOW NOR EVER SAID LINA BE A FISHPOND AND I WILL BE THE DUCK UPON IT
AND AS THEY WERE ENTERING THE VILLAGE THE SMALL PEASANT ALSO CAME QUIETLY IN DRIVING A FLOCK OF SHEEP AND LOOKING QUITE CONTENTED THEN THE PEASANTS WERE ASTONISHED AND SAID PEASANT FROM WHENCE DO YOU COME HAVE YOU COME OUT OF THE WATER YES TRULY REPLIED THE PEASANT
AND YET HE AND HIS WIFE DID SO WISH TO HAVE ONE ONE DAY HE SAID TO HER LISTEN I HAVE A GOOD IDEA THERE IS OUR GOSSIP THE CARPENTER HE SHALL MAKE US A WOODEN CALF AND PAINT IT BROWN SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER AND IN TIME
THEIR BEDS SPEAKING GLANCES FLASHED BETWEEN THE WRETCHED FOUR MUCH BED THERE WOULD BE FOR THEM IF THEY WENT HOME WITHOUT THE LAMB WE PROMISED MOTHER NOT TO LOSE SIGHT OF YOU IF WE TOOK YOU OUT
YOU'RE VERY KIND SAID THE LADY LOOKING AT THE LAMB SHE LOOKED RATHER SHY BUT AS THE BOYS PUT IT THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY NONSENSE ABOUT HER BUT OH WHISPERED CYRIL BEHIND THE PIG PAIL I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE'D HAD ENOUGH BICYCLE MENDING FOR ONE DAY
INTO THEIR OWN DEAR TIRESOME BABY BROTHER BUT HE IN HIS GROWN UPNESS INSISTED ON GOING ON AND THUS HE WAS MET IN THE FRONT GARDEN BY MARTHA NOW YOU REMEMBER THAT AS A SPECIAL FAVOUR
WHEN HE STAYED AT HOME SHE PLAYED AND SANG FOR HIM MADE HIM GOOD DRINKS SUPERINTENDED HIS DINNER WARMED HIS SLIPPERS AND STEEPED HIS SOUL IN COMFORT THE BEST OF WOMEN I HAVE HEARD MY GRANDMOTHER SAY ARE HYPOCRITES
AND PRONOUNCE HIM A GOOD NATURED JOVIAL RECKLESS FELLOW
THE CAPTAIN HAD VANISHED AND SUCH INFORMATION AS THEY GOT WAS FROM A STRAY PORTER OR BROKER AT THE AUCTION LOOK AT THEM WITH THEIR HOOKED BEAKS BECKY SAID GETTING INTO THE BUGGY HER PICTURE UNDER HER ARM IN GREAT GLEE THEY'RE LIKE VULTURES AFTER A BATTLE DON'T KNOW
AND TO ADOPT AN EASIER AND MORE LUXURIOUS MODE OF LIFE INDEED IT IS ONLY LATELY THAT THEIR RICH OLD MEN LEFT OFF THE LUXURY OF WEARING UNDERGARMENTS OF LINEN AND FASTENING A KNOT OF THEIR HAIR WITH A TIE OF GOLDEN GRASSHOPPERS
THEY SEEM TO HAVE TURNED TO CULTIVATION OF THE CHERSONESE AND TO PIRACY FROM WANT OF SUPPLIES THIS WAS WHAT REALLY ENABLED THE TROJANS TO KEEP THE FIELD FOR TEN YEARS AGAINST THEM THE DISPERSION OF THE ENEMY MAKING THEM ALWAYS A MATCH FOR THE DETACHMENT LEFT BEHIND
AND THUS DID HIS BEST TO PUT DOWN PIRACY IN THOSE WATERS A NECESSARY STEP TO SECURE THE REVENUES FOR HIS OWN USE
THENCE BY THE SUNRISE TRAIL TO CATHEDRAL PEAK VISITING THE BEAUTIFUL CATHEDRAL LAKE WHICH LIES ABOUT A MILE TO THE WEST OF CATHEDRAL PEAK EATING YOUR LUNCHEON AND THENCE TO CLOUDS REST AND THE VALLEY AS ABOVE
GILIAS PHLOXES MIMULUS ET CETERA MANY OF THEM WITH MORE PETALS THAN LEAVES ON THE BORDERS OF LITTLE STREAMS LARGER PLANTS FLOURISH LUPINES DAISIES ASTERS GOLDENRODS
DRINKING THE THIN SUNSHINE AND MATURING THEIR FINE PURPLE CONES AS IF THEY MEANT TO LIVE FOREVER THE GENERAL VIEW FROM THE SUMMIT IS ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND SUBLIME TO BE FOUND IN ALL THE RANGE
THE GOOD SOUL HAD VENTURED SOUTH AND TRIED TO BUY HER MOTHER BUT OLE MISSIS WOULD NOT LET HER GO AT ANY PRICE AND THE FAITHFUL CHATTEL WOULD NOT RUN AWAY
DESCRIBING THE CONDITION OF THE CITY AND SHOWING HOW BY THEIR OWN NEGLIGENCE IT HAD AGAIN FALLEN UNDER THE POWER OF THE PLEBEIANS FROM WHOM IT HAD BEEN WRESTED BY THEIR FATHERS IN THIRTEEN EIGHTY ONE
SO FREELY OFFERED IT CHRISTIE WAS SURE OF THIS
AND THAT GIOVANNI POSSESSED SEVERAL QUALITIES FAR SURPASSING THOSE OF SALVESTRO THE ASSOCIATES OF NICCOLO WERE UNINFLUENCED BY HIS REMARKS FOR THEY WERE JEALOUS OF HIS REPUTATION AND DESIRED TO EXALT SOME PERSON
I RETIRED TO MY UPSTAIRS SITTING ROOM AND GOT OUT ELIZA KLINEFELTER'S LAVENDER SLIPPERS AH WELL THE FOSTER MOTHERHOOD WOULD SOON HAVE TO BE PUT AWAY IN CAMPHOR AGAIN THE NEXT DAY BY DEGREES I GOT THE WHOLE STORY
WITH TWO MITES OF HUMMINGBIRDS SEATED ON A BRANCH THEIR GRAYISH GREEN SUITS TONED IN WITH THE COLOR OF THE BLUE GUMS IT WAS A SURPRISE WHEN ONE OF THEM TURNED TO THE OTHER AND FED IT THE MOTHER HUMMER WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO BE TAKEN FOR A NESTLING
MOREOVER HE SUSPECTED WHAT LOUISE DID NOT THAT THE MONEY WAS HIDDEN AT SUNNYSIDE HE HAD A SCRAP OF PAPER THAT INDICATED A CONCEALED ROOM SOMEWHERE HIS INHERITED CUPIDITY WAS AROUSED EAGER TO GET HALSEY AND JACK BAILEY OUT OF THE HOUSE
ANNOUNCED A VERDICT OF DEATH BY MISADVENTURE
AND TURNED TO THE WALL ON WHICH THE CHARTS AND MAPS WERE HUNG THERE WAS ONE THERE OF PARADISE WHEREON WAS MARKED THE SITE AND NAMES OF ALL THE TOMBS AND GRAVES IN THAT ANCIENT ENCLOSURE
HE NODDED CURTLY TO MANSUS
MYSTERIOUS UNDER SECRETARIES OF STATE WHO DISCUSS THINGS IN WHISPERS IN THE REMOTE CORNERS OF THEIR CLUBROOMS AND THE MORE FRANK VIEWS OF AMERICAN CORRESPONDENTS WHO HAD NO HESITATION IN PUTTING THOSE VIEWS INTO PRINT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR READERS
THE GENTLEMEN OF THE EMPEROR'S SUITE
SAID TO PIERRE AS THOUGH CONTINUING AN INTERRUPTED CONVERSATION THE MILITIA HAVE PUT ON CLEAN WHITE SHIRTS TO BE READY TO DIE WHAT HEROISM COUNT
WITH GREAT IMPATIENCE SOME DAYS AFTER ANATOLE'S DEPARTURE PIERRE RECEIVED A NOTE FROM PRINCE ANDREW INFORMING HIM OF HIS ARRIVAL AND ASKING HIM TO COME TO SEE HIM
KUTUZOV NOTICED PIERRE'S FIGURE AND THE GROUP GATHERED ROUND HIM CALL HIM TO ME SAID KUTUZOV
HIS COURAGE AND HIS FAIRNESS HAD SECURED FOR HIM MUCH RESPECT AND SOME ADULATION IN THE SPHERE OF HIS EARLY SUCCESSES HE HAD FELT HIMSELF REVERED AND ADMIRED AND CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT
AUTHORITIES FREE FROM ALL TAINT OF HATE AND DESPAIR AFTER PAYING THIS TRIBUTE TO WHAT IS NORMAL IN THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIETY
IT WAS VAIN TO PRETEND TO HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED BUT THAT WAS MERE FEELING THE STOICISM OF HIS THOUGHT COULD NOT BE DISTURBED BY THIS OR ANY OTHER FAILURE NEXT TIME
THE POLICEMAN ON THE BEAT PROJECTED HIS SOMBRE AND MOVING FORM AGAINST THE LUMINOUS GLORY OF ORANGES AND LEMONS AND ENTERED BRETT STREET WITHOUT HASTE THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER AS THOUGH HE WERE A MEMBER OF THE CRIMINAL CLASSES
THEN BY SUDDEN INSPIRATION RAISED THE COLLAR OF HIS JACKET THIS ARRANGEMENT APPEARED TO HIM COMMENDABLE
WHO PASSED UP TO A DISTANT TABLE LOOKING PERFECTLY SIGHTLESS AND ALTOGETHER UNAPPROACHABLE SHE SEEMED TO BE A HABITUAL CUSTOMER ON GOING OUT
SWEPT THE COMMON AND THE HEAT RAY WAS READY TO FOLLOW SAVE FOR SUCH THAT BIG AREA OF COMMON WAS SILENT AND DESOLATE AND THE CHARRED BODIES LAY ABOUT ON IT ALL NIGHT UNDER THE STARS AND ALL THE NEXT DAY A
ONE OF OUR CHIMNEYS CRACKED AS IF A SHOT HAD HIT IT FLEW AND A PIECE OF IT CAME CLATTERING DOWN THE TILES
CAUSED A WHIRL OF EXCITEMENT A SHOUTING AND A RUNNING TO AND FRO BUT FOR THE MOST PART THE DAILY ROUTINE OF WORKING EATING DRINKING SLEEPING WENT ON AS IT HAD DONE FOR COUNTLESS YEARS
I SHOUTED AFTER HIM WHAT NEWS HE TURNED STARED BAWLED SOMETHING ABOUT CRAWLING OUT IN A THING LIKE A DISH COVER
TO THE LIGHT AND SPEEDY INFANTRY OF PRACTICE THE REGIMENT RELIEVED OF A BURDEN RECEIVED A NEW IMPETUS BUT THERE WAS MUCH LOSS OF VALUABLE KNAPSACKS AND ON THE WHOLE VERY GOOD SHIRTS
YEH RUN LIKE A COW AND THE LOUD SOLDIER'S SHRILL VOICE COULD BE HEARD
HE WAS IN A MOVING BOX AS HE PERCEIVED THIS FACT IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE HAD NEVER WISHED TO COME TO THE WAR HE HAD NOT ENLISTED OF HIS FREE WILL HE HAD BEEN DRAGGED BY THE MERCILESS GOVERNMENT
THE LINE BROKEN INTO MOVING FRAGMENTS BY THE GROUND WENT CALMLY ON THROUGH FIELDS AND WOODS THE YOUTH LOOKED AT THE MEN NEAREST HIM AND SAW FOR THE MOST PART EXPRESSIONS OF DEEP INTEREST
BADGERED BY DREAMS PERHAPS HE SWAYED WITH LITTLE BOUNCES AND STARTS LIKE AN OLD TODDY STRICKEN GRANDFATHER IN A CHIMNEY CORNER DUST AND STAINS WERE UPON HIS FACE
POOR OL BOY WE MUST HOL ON A MINNIT WHAT AM I DOIN I'LL CALL SIMPSON ANOTHER FIGURE AT THAT MOMENT LOOMED IN THE GLOOM
MAY GIT A LOT A OTHER SICKNESSES TOO BY MORNIN
THEN THE PRINCE PROMISED TO GIVE HIM ONE GOLD PIECE FOR EACH PIECE OF WISDOM THE PLOUGHMAN AGREED AND SAID LISTEN ATTENTIVELY
WHICH WILL BE EQUALLY PERMANENT MONUMENTS OF THEIR ERRORS BUT IT IS NOT TO BE DENIED THAT THE PORTRAITS THEY HAVE SKETCHED OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT WERE TOO JUST COPIES OF THE ORIGINALS FROM WHICH THEY WERE TAKEN
AND MUST EFFECTUALLY REMOVE THE FALSE IMPRESSIONS WHICH A MISAPPLICATION OF OTHER PARTS OF THE WORK WAS CALCULATED TO MAKE THEY HAVE AT THE SAME TIME AN INTIMATE CONNECTION WITH THE MORE IMMEDIATE DESIGN OF THIS PAPER WHICH IS
IF THEY EXHIBIT OCCASIONAL CALMS THESE ONLY SERVE AS SHORT LIVED CONTRAST TO THE FURIOUS STORMS THAT ARE TO SUCCEED IF NOW AND THEN INTERVALS OF FELICITY OPEN TO VIEW WE BEHOLD THEM WITH A MIXTURE OF REGRET
YES PARTICULARLY FOR MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY
SUE I SOMETIMES THINK YOU ARE A FLIRT SAID HE ABRUPTLY THERE WAS A MOMENTARY PAUSE TILL SHE SUDDENLY JUMPED UP AND TO HIS SURPRISE HE SAW BY THE KETTLE FLAME THAT HER FACE WAS FLUSHED
AND WHERE THERE WERE MORE WANTON WOMEN THAN HONEST WIVES AND MAIDS IT IS ALSO SAID THAT AFTER THE MIDDLE AGES THE INHABITANTS WERE TOO POOR TO PAY THEIR PRIESTS AND HENCE WERE COMPELLED TO PULL DOWN THEIR CHURCHES AND REFRAIN ALTOGETHER FROM THE PUBLIC WORSHIP OF GOD
INCLUDING A FEW FREEDMEN THE CLIMATE THE SOIL THE COMMERCE AND THE INDUSTRY OF THE NORTH WERE ALL UNFAVORABLE TO THE GROWTH OF A SERVILE POPULATION STILL SLAVERY THOUGH SECTIONAL WAS A PART OF THE NATIONAL SYSTEM OF ECONOMY
THE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION CONSIDERED FROM ONE SIDE COLONIZATION WHATEVER THE MOTIVES OF THE EMIGRANTS WAS AN ECONOMIC MATTER IT INVOLVED THE USE OF CAPITAL TO PAY FOR THEIR PASSAGE TO SUSTAIN THEM ON THE VOYAGE AND TO START THEM ON THE WAY OF PRODUCTION
ARGOS FOR HER DELIVERER THE PRIDE OF CORINTH AGAIN RISING FROM HER RUINS WITH THE HONORS OF A ROMAN COLONY EXACTED A TRIBUTE FROM THE ADJACENT REPUBLICS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DEFRAYING THE GAMES OF THE ISTHMUS
AN EARTHQUAKE A WHIRLWIND AND A FIERY ERUPTION WHICH OVERTURNED AND SCATTERED THE NEW FOUNDATIONS OF THE TEMPLE
FOR HE IS A FELLOW OF TRINITY SENIOR WRANGLER OR SOMETHING AND THEY'RE NOT SO FOOLISH AS TO SEND THEIR CRACK MAN TO BE EATEN UP BY LIONS AND TIGERS IT MUST BE ROGER HAMLEY EXCLAIMED CYNTHIA HER EYES BRIGHTENING AND HER CHEEKS FLUSHING HE'S NOT THE ELDEST SON
AT THE THOUGHT OF THE UNVALUED TREASURE LYING AT CYNTHIA'S FEET AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MERELY UNSELFISH REGRET IT WAS THE OLD FERVID TENDERNESS
BY THE WAY YOU'VE RECOMMENDED ME A GOOD PATIENT POOR LADY NOT TO GO ON TALKING IN THIS HEARTLESS WAY I SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT MISSUS HALE THAT LADY IN CRAMPTON YOU KNOW HASN'T MANY WEEKS TO LIVE I NEVER HAD ANY HOPE OF CURE AS I THINK I TOLD YOU
AS IT WAS HE LOOKED TO THE SPEEDY ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THAT ALONE IT WAS HIS MOTHER'S GREEDY EARS THAT SUCKED IN FROM THE WOMEN KIND OF THESE MAGISTRATES AND WEALTHY MEN HOW HIGHLY MISTER THIS OR MISTER THAT THOUGHT OF MISTER THORNTON THAT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THERE
SPARGO TURNED AND LOOKED AT HIM
ALL RIGHT SAID BRETON HE TURNED AWAY TOWARDS SPARGO WHO HAD ALREADY MOVED OFF WHAT NEXT HE ASKED CHARING CROSS I SUPPOSE SPARGO SMILED AND SHOOK HIS HEAD NO HE ANSWERED I'VE NO USE FOR CHARING CROSS
ACCORDINGLY HE WENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR INTO WHICH HE HAD SEEN MISS BAYLIS TURN HE KNEW THAT ALL THE DOORS IN THAT HOUSE WERE DOUBLE ONES AND THAT THE OUTER OAK IN EACH WAS SOLID AND SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH TO BE SOUND PROOF YET
AND I HOPE IT WILL HAVE THE EFFECT TO MAKE YOU MORE MERCIFUL IPHIS WAS A YOUNG MAN OF HUMBLE PARENTAGE WHO SAW AND LOVED ANAXARETE A
AND MAELGAN ASKED THE BOY TALIESIN WHAT WAS HIS ERRAND AND HE ANSWERED HIM IN SONG ELPHIN THE SON OF GWYDDNO IS IN THE LAND OF ARTRO SECURED BY THIRTEEN LOCKS FOR PRAISING HIS INSTRUCTOR
AND WHEN I THOUGHT HE HAD TURNED AWAY AGAIN ROSE AND INSTANTLY LEFT THE APARTMENT TAKING REFUGE IN MY FAVOURITE RESORT THE LIBRARY THERE WAS NO LIGHT THERE
THE LIVELIEST WALTZES SEEMED TO FLOAT UPON THE AIR ISABEL OFTEN FOUND HERSELF IRRITATED BY THIS PERPETUAL FIDDLING
BUT HIS WIFE REMAINED IN THE DRAWING ROOM WITH THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PARTY SHE PROLONGED HER VIGIL FOR SOMETHING LESS THAN AN HOUR AND THEN RISING OBSERVED TO ISABEL THAT IT WAS TIME THEY SHOULD BID THE GENTLEMEN GOOD NIGHT ISABEL HAD AS YET NO DESIRE TO GO TO BED
BUT WHICH HE HAD NOW CEASED TO ENJOY ISABEL ENJOYED IT LARGELY AND HANDLING THE REINS IN A MANNER WHICH APPROVED ITSELF TO THE GROOM AS KNOWING WAS NEVER WEARY OF DRIVING HER UNCLE'S CAPITAL HORSES THROUGH WINDING LANES AND BYWAYS
SHE WOULD BE AS AMERICAN AS IT PLEASED HIM TO REGARD HER AND IF HE CHOSE TO LAUGH AT HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM PLENTY OF OCCUPATION SHE DEFENDED ENGLAND AGAINST HIS MOTHER BUT WHEN RALPH SANG ITS PRAISES ON PURPOSE AS SHE SAID TO WORK HER UP
ASKING A HUNDRED QUESTIONS ABOUT HIM HAD HE HAD ANY COLDS DID HE STILL DAWDLE OVER HIS OATMEAL WHAT ABOUT UNFORTUNATE MORNING INCIDENTS
HE SHOUTED IN THE POOL AT THE CORONADO AND HE SPOKE OF THOUGH HE DID NOTHING MORE RADICAL THAN SPEAK OF BUYING EVENING CLOTHES CAROL WAS TOUCHED BY HIS EFFORTS TO ENJOY PICTURE GALLERIES
AND THE MATERIAL MUST HAVE COST MORE THAN SHE COULD REALLY AFFORD IT IS VERY SWEET OF HER BUT LESLIE WAS BRUSQUE AND CURT WHEN ANNE THANKED HER AND AGAIN THE LATTER FELT THROWN BACK UPON HERSELF
I GIVE YOU JOY OF HAVING LEFT WINCHESTER NOW YOU MAY OWN HOW MISERABLE YOU WERE THERE NOW IT WILL GRADUALLY ALL COME OUT YOUR CRIMES AND YOUR MISERIES HOW OFTEN YOU WENT UP BY THE MAIL TO LONDON AND THREW AWAY FIFTY GUINEAS AT A TAVERN
YOU WILL HEAR FROM UNCLE HENRY HOW WELL ANNA IS SHE SEEMS PERFECTLY RECOVERED BEN WAS HERE ON SATURDAY TO ASK UNCLE CHARLES AND ME TO DINE WITH THEM AS TO MORROW BUT I WAS FORCED TO DECLINE IT THE WALK IS BEYOND MY STRENGTH
IN THE PEACE OF MIND WHICH WAS GRANTED HER IN HER LAST DAYS HER SWEETNESS OF TEMPER NEVER FAILED SHE WAS EVER CONSIDERATE AND GRATEFUL TO THOSE WHO ATTENDED ON HER AT TIMES WHEN SHE FELT RATHER BETTER HER PLAYFULNESS OF SPIRIT REVIVED
THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED CAFES THE RUSHING CARRIAGES AND THE DENSE THRONG UPON THE FOOTPATHS BUT INSIDE IN THE SUMPTUOUS CHAMBER OF THE RICH YOUNG ENGLISH ARCHAEOLOGIST THERE WAS ONLY OLD ROME TO BE SEEN
TO PROPERLY APPRECIATE THE OTHER THEIR COMMON INTERESTS AND PURSUITS HAD BROUGHT THEM TOGETHER AND EACH HAD BEEN ATTRACTED BY THE OTHER'S KNOWLEDGE AND THEN GRADUALLY SOMETHING HAD BEEN ADDED TO THIS KENNEDY HAD BEEN AMUSED BY THE FRANKNESS AND SIMPLICITY OF HIS RIVAL
ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU DON'T TELL ME I SHALL MAKE A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH
NO DOUBT IT WAS ONE OF THE MEANS OF PROTECTION WHICH THE CHRISTIANS ADOPTED THE ODDS ARE TWO THOUSAND TO ONE AGAINST A MAN GETTING OUT EVEN IF HE HAD A LIGHT BUT IF HE WERE IN THE DARK IT WOULD OF COURSE BE FAR MORE DIFFICULT SO I SHOULD THINK
WERE THE FLAT FRONTED WHITE BUILDINGS OF THAT IMPOSING CITY THAT CAME DOWN TO THE VERY WATER'S EDGE BEHIND THESE THE RED ROOFS ROSE LIKE TERRACES MARKING THE GENTLE SLOPE UPON WHICH THE CITY WAS BUILT DOMINATED HERE BY A TURRET
DID YOU NOT MURDER LEVASSEUR LEVASSEUR HE SMILED A LITTLE SO THEY'VE TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT DO YOU DENY IT I KILLED HIM IT IS TRUE
WHILE THESE MOLTEN WAVES LAUNCHING INTO THE SKY THEIR WREATHS OF SMOKE EVAPORATED THE MOISTURE OF THE MOULD AND HURLED IT UPWARD THROUGH THE VENT HOLES OF THE STONE LINING IN THE FORM OF DENSE VAPOR CLOUDS
BUT HE WANTED TO KNOW AT ANY COST WHY HIS PROJECTILE HAD DEVIATED BUT THE PROJECTILE CONTINUED ITS COURSE SIDEWAYS TO THE MOON AND WITH IT THE MASS OF THINGS THROWN OUT BARBICANE COULD EVEN PROVE BY THE ELEVATIONS WHICH SERVED AS LANDMARKS UPON THE MOON
WHICH WAS ONLY TWO THOUSAND LEAGUES DISTANT THAT ITS SPEED WAS BECOMING UNIFORM FRESH PROOF THAT THERE WAS NO FALL ITS IMPULSIVE FORCE STILL PREVAILED OVER THE LUNAR ATTRACTION BUT THE PROJECTILE'S COURSE WAS CERTAINLY BRINGING IT NEARER TO THE MOON
THE CAMBRIDGE OBSERVATORY'S NOTE SAYS THAT THE TRANSIT OUGHT TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN NINETY SEVEN HOURS THIRTEEN MINUTES AND TWENTY SECONDS WHICH MEANS TO SAY THAT SOONER THE MOON WILL NOT BE AT THE POINT INDICATED AND LATER IT WILL HAVE PASSED IT TRUE
PEPPER CAYENNE AND A LITTLE MACE STEW UNTIL TENDER SERVE WITH A MUSHROOM SAUCE MADE AS FOLLOWS TAKE A SMALL BOTTLE OF MUSHROOMS OR ONE DOZEN FRESH MUSHROOMS
TAKE A CUP OF RICE
AFTER THE WATER IN THE LOWER VESSEL HAS BOILED A WHILE IF THE RICE SEEMS A LITTLE DRY ADD MORE WATER COOK UNTIL THE RICE IS SOFT THEN TURN THE FIRE VERY LOW SO THAT THE WATER IN THE LOWER VESSEL DOES NOT BOIL
FOR DURING THIS INTERVAL A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE IN MASTER HUGH AND HIS ONCE KIND AND AFFECTIONATE WIFE THE INFLUENCE OF BRANDY UPON HIM AND OF SLAVERY UPON HER HAD EFFECTED A DISASTROUS CHANGE IN THE CHARACTERS OF BOTH
IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY TO HAVE A VALUATION OF THE PROPERTY THAT IT MIGHT BE EQUALLY DIVIDED BETWEEN MISSUS LUCRETIA AND MASTER ANDREW I WAS IMMEDIATELY SENT FOR TO BE VALUED WITH THE OTHER PROPERTY
HARDENED BY A LONG LIFE OF SLAVEHOLDING HE WOULD AT TIMES SEEM TO TAKE GREAT PLEASURE IN WHIPPING A SLAVE I HAVE OFTEN BEEN AWAKENED AT THE DAWN OF DAY BY THE MOST HEART RENDING SHRIEKS OF AN OWN AUNT OF MINE
IF WE COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE CONDUCT AND SENTIMENTS OF HIS ACTORS EITHER NATURAL OR UNNATURAL TO SUCH CHARACTERS AND IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
HERE IS A CONNECTED CHAIN OF NATURAL CAUSES AND VOLUNTARY ACTIONS BUT THE MIND FEELS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IN PASSING FROM ONE LINK TO ANOTHER NOR IS LESS CERTAIN OF THE FUTURE EVENT THAN IF IT WERE CONNECTED WITH THE OBJECTS PRESENT TO THE MEMORY OR SENSES BY A TRAIN OF CAUSES
AMONG MANKIND WOULD YOU KNOW THE SENTIMENTS INCLINATIONS AND COURSE OF LIFE OF THE GREEKS AND ROMANS STUDY WELL THE TEMPER AND ACTIONS OF THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH YOU CANNOT BE MUCH MISTAKEN IN TRANSFERRING TO THE FORMER MOST OF THE OBSERVATIONS
IT WAS THOSE BEDS AT SIR JOHN'S NOW MARGARET YOU'RE YOUNG ENOUGH AND GO ABOUT IN THE DAY ARE THE BEDS COMFORTABLE I APPEAL TO YOU DO THEY GIVE YOU A FEELING OF PERFECT REPOSE WHEN YOU LIE DOWN UPON THEM
NOW MARGARET I DON'T KNOW WHERE MY BOY IS AND SOMETIMES I THINK I SHALL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN MARGARET SAT DOWN BY HER MOTHER'S SOFA ON A LITTLE STOOL AND SOFTLY TOOK HOLD OF HER HAND
THEIR INTERCOURSE HAD BEEN ONE CONTINUED SERIES OF OPPOSITION THEIR OPINIONS CLASHED AND INDEED SHE HAD NEVER PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD CARED FOR HER OPINIONS AS BELONGING TO HER THE INDIVIDUAL
IN A NEWSPAPER A FEW CRUMBS OF GINGER NUTS AND A MORSEL OF CHEESE YES THOUGHT I IT IS EVIDENT ENOUGH THAT BARTLEBY HAS BEEN MAKING HIS HOME HERE KEEPING BACHELOR'S HALL ALL BY HIMSELF IMMEDIATELY THEN THE THOUGHT CAME SWEEPING ACROSS ME
I LOOKED ROUND ANXIOUSLY PEEPED BEHIND HIS SCREEN
HE SAYS A SECOND TIME HE WON'T EXAMINE HIS PAPERS WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT TURKEY IT WAS AFTERNOON BE IT REMEMBERED TURKEY SAT GLOWING LIKE A BRASS BOILER HIS BALD HEAD STEAMING HIS HANDS REELING AMONG HIS BLOTTED PAPERS THINK OF IT
DID THEY THROW STONES INTO THE DRAWING ROOM MARGARET DID INDEED LOOK WHITE AND WAN ALTHOUGH HER SENSES WERE BEGINNING TO RETURN TO HER BUT THE SICKLY DAZE OF THE SWOON MADE HER STILL MISERABLY FAINT
PERHAPS I MAY ASK YOU TO ACCOMPANY ME DOWNSTAIRS AND BAR THE DOOR BEHIND ME MY MOTHER AND SISTER WILL NEED THAT PROTECTION
THAT SHE WOULD ASK FOR WHATEVER THEY MIGHT WANT IN THE PROGRESS OF HER MOTHER'S ILLNESS MISSUS THORNTON'S BROW CONTRACTED AND HER MOUTH GREW SET WHILE MARGARET SPOKE WITH GENTLE MODESTY OF HER MOTHER'S RESTLESSNESS AND DOCTOR DONALDSON'S WISH
HE WENT AWAY AS IF WEIGHTS WERE TIED TO EVERY LIMB THAT BORE HIM FROM HER HE CALLED JANE HE CALLED HIS SISTER SHE SHOULD HAVE ALL WOMANLY CARE ALL GENTLE TENDANCE BUT EVERY PULSE BEAT IN HIM AS HE REMEMBERED
HE CANNOT ALWAYS MEET WITH A PURCHASER WHILST THE EUROPEAN READILY FINDS A MARKET AND THE FORMER CAN ONLY PRODUCE AT A CONSIDERABLE COST THAT WHICH THE LATTER VENDS AT A VERY LOW RATE THUS THE INDIAN HAS NO SOONER ESCAPED THOSE EVILS TO WHICH BARBAROUS NATIONS ARE EXPOSED
AND SLAVERY DOES NOT PRODUCE MORE FATAL EFFECTS UPON THE FIRST THAN INDEPENDENCE UPON THE SECOND THE NEGRO HAS LOST ALL PROPERTY IN HIS OWN PERSON AND HE CANNOT DISPOSE OF HIS EXISTENCE WITHOUT COMMITTING A SORT OF FRAUD
WHICH WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CREEK TERRITORY AN INDIAN WOMAN APPEARED FOLLOWED BY A NEGRESS AND HOLDING BY THE HAND A LITTLE WHITE GIRL OF FIVE OR SIX YEARS OLD WHOM I TOOK TO BE THE DAUGHTER OF THE PIONEER A SORT OF BARBAROUS LUXURY SET OFF THE COSTUME OF THE INDIAN
WHILST THE SAVAGE DISPLAYED IN THE MIDST OF HER TENDERNESS AN AIR OF FREEDOM AND OF PRIDE WHICH WAS ALMOST FEROCIOUS
SHE WOULD SEND WANDERING BREEZES TO VISIT HIM WITH THE BALM OF BAY AND RESINOUS GUM
AND DID THEY BELONG HERE IT NEEDED BUT A GLANCE TO SHOW THEM KENTUCK LYING THERE CRUELLY CRUSHED AND BRUISED BUT STILL HOLDING THE LUCK OF ROARING CAMP IN HIS ARMS
BUT SAID STUMPY QUICKLY FOLLOWING UP HIS ADVANTAGE WE'RE HERE FOR A CHRISTENING AND WE'LL HAVE IT I PROCLAIM YOU THOMAS LUCK ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
BY THE TIME HE WAS A MONTH OLD THE NECESSITY OF GIVING HIM A NAME BECAME APPARENT HE HAD GENERALLY BEEN KNOWN AS THE KID STUMPY'S BOY THE COYOTE
AND WE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN KEEPING OURSELVES IN THE FIRST FLIGHT THOUGH IT WAS A FAIRLY STIFF RUN
NOW AS HE PASSED THROUGH A TANGLE OF SMALL STREETS THAT LED INDIRECTLY TO THE ELEGANT MAYFAIR TERRACE FOR WHICH HE WAS BOUND A HORROR AT THE IDEA OF CONFRONTING JOAN SEBASTABLE AT HER TEA TABLE SEIZED ON HIM
AN UPLAND TOWNSHIP IN ONE OF THOSE SMALL PRINCEDOMS THAT MAKE INCONSPICUOUS FRECKLES ON THE MAP OF CENTRAL EUROPE A LONG STANDING ACQUAINTANCESHIP WITH THE REIGNING FAMILY
ONE OF A PARTY OF PLAYERS WHO HAD COME OUT INTO THE WOOD TO REHEARSE THEIR PLAY THIS CLOWN HAD MET WITH PUCK WHO HAD CLAPPED AN ASS'S HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS SO THAT IT LOOKED AS IF IT GREW THERE
SIT DOWN WITH ME SAID THE QUEEN TO THE CLOWN AND LET ME STROKE YOUR DEAR CHEEKS AND STICK MUSK ROSES IN YOUR SMOOTH SLEEK HEAD AND KISS YOUR FAIR LARGE EARS MY GENTLE JOY WHERE'S PEASEBLOSSOM
AND PICKED UP HIS CANE FROM THE GROUND A PROCEEDING TO WHICH I WAS PERHAPS WRONG NOT TO ATTACH SOME IMPORTANCE WE WERE NOW OUT OF THE PARK ROULETABILLE HAD DROPPED INTO SILENCE
AND CAME TO THINK IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE THAT WE SHOULD BE MARRIED AND IN THE END IT CAME ABOUT AND WE WERE MARRIED
SHE PANTED COMING NEARER NEARER VERY CLOSE AND NOW YOU HEAR THEM STOPPING AT THE GARDEN GATE
