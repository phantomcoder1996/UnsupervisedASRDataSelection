THE DAY PASSED AWAY IN UTTER SILENCE NIGHT CAME WITHOUT RECURRENCE OF THE NOISE IT IS A PRISONER SAID EDMOND JOYFULLY THE NIGHT PASSED IN PERFECT SILENCE EDMOND DID NOT CLOSE HIS EYES
YOU DESTROY EVERYTHING FIRST YOU BREAK YOUR JUG THEN YOU MAKE ME BREAK YOUR PLATE IF ALL THE PRISONERS FOLLOWED YOUR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE RUINED I SHALL LEAVE YOU THE SAUCEPAN AND POUR YOUR SOUP INTO THAT SO FOR THE FUTURE I HOPE YOU WILL NOT BE SO DESTRUCTIVE
THE PRISONER HAD DISCOVERED THE DANGER AND HAD SUBSTITUTED A LEVER FOR A CHISEL ENCOURAGED BY THIS DISCOVERY EDMOND DETERMINED TO ASSIST THE INDEFATIGABLE LABORER
RESTORING VIGOR AND AGILITY TO HIS LIMBS BY EXERCISE AND SO PREPARING HIMSELF FOR HIS FUTURE DESTINY AT INTERVALS HE LISTENED TO LEARN IF THE NOISE HAD NOT BEGUN AGAIN AND GREW IMPATIENT AT THE PRUDENCE OF THE PRISONER
THE PRISONER REPROACHED HIMSELF WITH NOT HAVING THUS EMPLOYED THE HOURS HE HAD PASSED IN VAIN HOPES PRAYER AND DESPONDENCY DURING THE SIX YEARS THAT HE HAD BEEN IMPRISONED WHAT MIGHT HE NOT HAVE ACCOMPLISHED
I TOOK THE WALL YOU ARE MINING FOR THE OUTER WALL OF THE FORTRESS BUT THEN YOU WOULD BE CLOSE TO THE SEA THAT IS WHAT I HOPED AND SUPPOSING YOU HAD SUCCEEDED I SHOULD HAVE THROWN MYSELF INTO THE SEA
IT IS WELL RETURNED THE VOICE TO MORROW
THE JAILER ALWAYS BROUGHT DANTES SOUP IN AN IRON SAUCEPAN THIS SAUCEPAN CONTAINED SOUP FOR BOTH PRISONERS
IT WAS ONE OF THESE HE HAD UNCOVERED AND WHICH HE MUST REMOVE FROM ITS SOCKET DANTES STROVE TO DO THIS WITH HIS NAILS BUT THEY WERE TOO WEAK THE FRAGMENTS OF THE JUG BROKE AND AFTER AN HOUR OF USELESS TOIL HE PAUSED
SOON THE FURY OF THE WAVES AND THE SIGHT OF THE SHARP ROCKS ANNOUNCED THE APPROACH OF DEATH AND DEATH THEN TERRIFIED ME AND I USED ALL MY SKILL AND INTELLIGENCE AS A MAN AND A SAILOR TO STRUGGLE AGAINST THE WRATH OF GOD BUT I DID SO BECAUSE I WAS HAPPY
A FRENCHMAN YOUR NAME
WHEN MY MORNING AND EVENING MEALS ARE BROUGHT THOUGHT HE I WILL CAST THEM OUT OF THE WINDOW AND THEY WILL THINK THAT I HAVE EATEN THEM HE KEPT HIS WORD TWICE A DAY HE CAST OUT THROUGH THE BARRED APERTURE THE PROVISIONS HIS JAILER BROUGHT HIM
JUST AS HE REMOVED HIS BED FROM THE WALL HE HEARD THREE KNOCKS HE THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES IS IT YOU SAID HE I AM HERE IS YOUR JAILER GONE
AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH A TREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEW MINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY
KNOW THAT ONE BY ONE MY FRIENDS WERE SNATCHED AWAY I WAS LEFT DESOLATE MY OWN STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED
MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT
AND THAT I WAS RESERVED FOR VENGEANCE THE LAUGHTER DIED AWAY WHEN A WELL KNOWN AND ABHORRED VOICE APPARENTLY CLOSE TO MY EAR
SCARED BY THIS HORRID APPARITION INFORMED ME OF HIS PATH SOMETIMES HE HIMSELF WHO FEARED THAT IF I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM I SHOULD DESPAIR AND DIE LEFT SOME MARK TO GUIDE ME
I SAW AT THE OPEN WINDOW A FIGURE THE MOST HIDEOUS AND ABHORRED A GRIN WAS ON THE FACE OF THE MONSTER HE SEEMED TO JEER AS WITH HIS FIENDISH FINGER HE POINTED TOWARDS THE CORPSE OF MY WIFE
THE MONSTER WHOM I HAD CREATED THE MISERABLE DAEMON WHOM I HAD SENT ABROAD INTO THE WORLD FOR MY DESTRUCTION I WAS POSSESSED BY A MADDENING RAGE WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM
THAT WERE BEGINNING TO RISE SUDDENLY A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN DESCENDED I HAD BEEN CALM DURING THE DAY BUT SO SOON AS NIGHT OBSCURED THE SHAPES OF OBJECTS
ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE
WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MY EYES FOREVER AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERING MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK
FROM A SENSE OF SHAME ANGER OR OTHER CAUSE
AS IF FLEEING FROM AN IMMATERIAL THING SUDDENLY QUICKENED WITH THE POWER OF ACCUSATION HE COULD PICTURE THE FRESH OBLONG EXCAVATION IN THE SOIL OF THE FAMILY BURIAL GROUND
THE DULL THUD OF EARTH FALLING REGULARLY HE PAUSED LISTENING THE LABOUR OF THE MEN WAS GIVEN AN UNCOUTH RHYTHM BY THEIR GRUNTING EXPULSIONS OF BREATH OTHERWISE THE NATURE OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND ITS SURROUNDINGS HAD IMPOSED UPON THEM A SILENCE
WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
BUT SHE WAS HAUNTED BY A DREAD THAT SHE WOULD NEVER AGAIN SEE HER HUSBAND ALIVE NEXT MORNING SOON AFTER DAYLIGHT THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ASTIR AND THE COUNTRY ROUND WAS CAREFULLY SEARCHED FOR ANY TRACE OF THE MISSING MAN
BARS THINGS FOUND IN HARBORS HOTELS FENCES PRISONS COURTS AND MUSIC
FROM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH DOCTOR SCOTT THE LOCAL CORONER HELD HIMSELF IN READINESS TO SUMMON A CORONER'S JURY AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE WHEN ALL THESE MEASURES PROVED UNAVAILING A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE INHABITANTS WAS CONVENED AND FUNDS WERE SUBSCRIBED TO STILL FURTHER PROSECUTE THE SEARCH
AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED

OVERCOAT I'VE NEARLY FROZEN DRIVING FROM SMITHTOWN BEFORE EITHER MAN COULD GROPE FOR A SUITABLE GREETING HE FACED BOBBY
ROBINSON JERKED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE WINDOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE PREPARATIONS OUT THERE
HENCE AN UNATTACHED MAN WHICH ANY LADY MAY STICK STICK TO OR GET STUCK ON BACKBITER A MOSQUITO BALANCE SOMETHING WANTED BY BOOK KEEPERS AND OFTEN LOST BY TOPERS
BOBBY HANDED HIM A BANKNOTE HE DIDN'T MISS GRAHAM'S MEANING GLANCE
AND DEPOSITED ON A DRY PATCH OF GROUND NEAR THE EDGE OF THE MORASS A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE INTERIOR THEY CAME UPON A MAN'S COAT MADE OF DARK BROWN STUFF
WHY HE SHOULD FAIL TO REFER TO BOBBY'S QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT OF HIS ARREST OR TO THE OPENLY EXPRESSED ENMITY OF GRAHAM ONLY ONE THEORY PROMISED TO FIT AT ALL IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PANAMANIAN TO RETURN TO THE CEDARS
HATRED

AND THE MELODY OF ITS VOICE IT IS CHIEFLY AS A SONGSTER THAT THE FOWL IS ESTEEMED THE CAGE OF HIM IN FULL CHORUS HAS BEEN KNOWN TO DRAW TEARS FROM TWO PERSONS AT ONCE THE SCIENTIFIC NAME OF THIS DICKY BIRD IS PORCUS ROCKEFELLERI
A MORE THAN COMMONLY PLAIN AND UNMISTAKABLE REMINDER
AND SO IN DUE COURSE WAS APPOINTED PRIOR
IT WAS A MORNING NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN BY LORD AND LADY DILWORTH WHO ON THAT DAY WOULD BE ROBBED OF THE TREASURE HELD FIRM AND FAST BY THEM FOR THE LENGTHENED PERIOD OF NINE YEARS AND WHICH THEY YIELDED UP WITH HEARTS OF SORROW
DID LADY DUNFERN EVER DREAM THAT HER APOLOGY FOR DISOBEDIENCE TO LADY DILWORTH'S ORDERS IN NOT ARRAYING HERSELF IN THE GARB OF GLISTENING GLORY COULD EVER BE ACCEPTED EVEN BY THE KIND AND LOVING LADY DILWORTH
HE RUSHED AMONGST THEM SHOUTING ONE TWO HIT AND HEW THREE FOUR BLAST AND BORE AND WITH EVERY RHYME HE CAME DOWN A GREAT STAMP UPON A FOOT CUTTING AT THE SAME TIME THEIR FACES EXECUTING INDEED A SWORD DANCE OF THE WILDEST DESCRIPTION
FOR HE HAD SOON FOUND THEIR HEADS ALL BUT INVULNERABLE THE QUEEN HAD ATTACKED HIS LEGS AND FEET WITH HER HORRIBLE GRANITE SHOE AND HE WAS SOON DOWN BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD GOT HIS BACK TO THE WALL AND STOOD OUT LONGER
TOOK THE DRESSING FROM HIS LEG RUBBED IT WITH SOMETHING THAT SMELT LIKE ROSES AND THEN WAVED HER HANDS OVER HIM THREE TIMES AT THE LAST WAVE OF HER HANDS EVERYTHING VANISHED HE FELT HIMSELF SINKING INTO THE PROFOUNDEST SLUMBER
WAS NOW PUNCTILIOUS INDEED BUT PUNCTILIOUS FOR HIS UNFORTUNATE FRIENDS AGAINST HIMSELF HE GAVE ORDERS THAT MARY SHOULD RECEIVE ALL THE MARKS OF RESPECT THAT HAD EVER BEEN PAID TO HIS OWN DECEASED WIFE
THE ONLY APPLAUSE BY WHICH HIS STOICAL NATURE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN STRONGLY MOVED WAS THE APPLAUSE OF HIS DEAR NATIVE COUNTRY OF HIS IMMENSE POPULARITY IN ENGLAND HE SPOKE WITH COLD DISDAIN
IRENE WAS AROUSED BY THE RINGING OF THE BREAKFAST BELL BEFORE SHE GOT TIME TO FINISH THE SENTENCE THAT TROUBLED HER WEARY BRAIN FOR MONTHS BEFORE DRESSING HERSELF WITH FRANTIC EXPERTNESS SHE DASHED DOWN THE WINDING STAIRCASE
SUMPTUOUS FURNITURE HAD BEEN HASTILY SENT IN THE NURSERY OF THE PRINCE OF WALES HAD BEEN CAREFULLY FURNISHED WITH EVERYTHING THAT AN INFANT COULD REQUIRE ONE OF THE ATTENDANTS PRESENTED TO THE QUEEN THE KEY OF A SUPERB CASKET WHICH STOOD IN HER APARTMENT
WHEN CURDIE WAS WITHIN A FEW PACES SHE RUSHED AT HIM MADE ONE TREMENDOUS STAMP AT HIS OPPOSING FOOT WHICH HAPPILY HE WITHDREW IN TIME AND CAUGHT HIM ROUND THE WAIST TO DASH HIM ON THE MARBLE FLOOR BUT JUST AS SHE CAUGHT HIM
AND IN A FEW MINUTES THE HALL WAS NEARLY EMPTY THE GOBLINS RUNNING FROM IT AS FAST AS THEY COULD HOWLING AND SHRIEKING AND LIMPING AND COWERING EVERY NOW AND THEN AS THEY RAN TO CUDDLE THEIR WOUNDED FEET IN THEIR HARD HANDS OR TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE FRIGHTFUL STAMP STAMP OF THE ARMED MEN
AND LIFTED THE PROSTRATE CAPTAIN WHO WAS ALL BUT PRESSED TO DEATH IT WAS SOME MOMENTS BEFORE HE RECOVERED BREATH AND CONSCIOUSNESS WHERE'S THE PRINCESS CRIED CURDIE AGAIN AND AGAIN NO ONE KNEW AND OFF THEY ALL RUSHED IN SEARCH OF HER
STAMP ON THEIR FEET STAMP ON THEIR FEET HE SHOUTED AND IN A MOMENT THE GOBLINS WERE DISAPPEARING THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FLOOR LIKE RATS AND MICE THEY COULD NOT VANISH SO FAST HOWEVER
A CERTAIN MAN HAS BEEN ABROAD MANY YEARS POSEIDON IS EVER ON THE WATCH FOR HIM AND HE IS ALL ALONE MATTERS AT HOME TOO HAVE COME TO THIS THAT HIS SUBSTANCE IS BEING WASTED
H AND O AND IN A AMONG THE VOWELS THAT MAY BE LONG ARE FEMININES SO THAT THERE IS AN EQUAL NUMBER OF MASCULINE AND FEMININE
WE MAINTAIN THAT TRAGEDY IS PRIMARILY AN IMITATION OF ACTION AND THAT IT IS MAINLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE ACTION THAT IT IMITATES THE PERSONAL AGENTS THIRD COMES THE ELEMENT OF THOUGHT
POLEOS PELEIADEO FOR PELEIDON IT IS SAID TO BE CURTAILED WHEN IT HAS LOST A PART
I SAY THAT YOUR WORSHIP IS ENTIRELY RIGHT SAID SANCHO AND THAT I AM AN ASS BUT I KNOW NOT HOW THE NAME OF ASS CAME INTO MY MOUTH FOR A ROPE
THE STORY ALSO OF HERACLES MUST BE ONE STORY HOMER HOWEVER EVIDENTLY UNDERSTOOD THIS POINT QUITE WELL WHETHER BY ART OR INSTINCT JUST IN THE SAME WAY AS HE EXCELS THE REST IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT
AN END IS THAT WHICH IS NATURALLY AFTER SOMETHING ITSELF EITHER AS ITS NECESSARY OR USUAL CONSEQUENT AND WITH NOTHING ELSE AFTER IT AND A MIDDLE THAT WHICH IS BY NATURE AFTER ONE THING
WHICH WILL BE WITH THE NEWS YOUR WORSHIP DESIRES AND DESERVES IF NOT LET THE LADY DULCINEA LOOK TO IT IF SHE DOES NOT ANSWER REASONABLY
HAVING BEEN OFFERED IN SACRIFICE AND SPIRITED AWAY FROM HER SACRIFICERS INTO ANOTHER LAND WHERE THE CUSTOM WAS TO SACRIFICE ALL STRANGERS TO THE GODDESS SHE WAS MADE THERE THE PRIESTESS OF THIS RITE
THE UNITY OF A PLOT DOES NOT CONSIST AS SOME SUPPOSE IN ITS HAVING ONE MAN AS ITS SUBJECT AN INFINITY OF THINGS BEFALL THAT ONE MAN SOME OF WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REDUCE TO UNITY
WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF A STORY AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF NEARLY ALL THE EARLY DRAMATISTS WE MAINTAIN THEREFORE THAT THE FIRST ESSENTIAL THE LIFE AND SOUL SO TO SPEAK OF TRAGEDY IS THE PLOT
THE LETTERS DIFFER IN VARIOUS WAYS AS PRODUCED BY DIFFERENT CONFORMATIONS OR IN DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE MOUTH AS ASPIRATED NOT ASPIRATED OR SOMETIMES ONE AND SOMETIMES THE OTHER
THE LIMIT HOWEVER SET BY THE ACTUAL NATURE OF THE THING IS THIS THE LONGER THE STORY CONSISTENTLY WITH ITS BEING COMPREHENSIBLE AS A WHOLE THE FINER IT IS BY REASON OF ITS MAGNITUDE AS A ROUGH GENERAL FORMULA
THIS POOR FELLOW WHOM THOU HAST SO BELABORED IS COUNTED THE BEST HAND AT THE QUARTERSTAFF IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND HIS NAME IS LITTLE JOHN AND MINE ROBIN HOOD
A YOUTH IN THE DRESS OF A PEASANT WHOSE FACE THEY WERE UNABLE AT THE MOMENT TO SEE AS HE WAS LEANING FORWARD BATHING HIS FEET IN THE BROOK THAT FLOWED PAST THEY APPROACHED SO SILENTLY THAT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THEM BEING FULLY OCCUPIED IN BATHING HIS FEET
THERE ARE OTHER INNS THAT THOU KNOWEST YET HEREABOUTS
WHILE I WEARIED MYSELF WITH WATCHING FOR ONE
AND AS THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHILD TO MAKE THEIR HEIR AND ARE AFFECTIONATE PARENTS I WAS ONE OF THE MOST INDULGED DAUGHTERS THAT EVER PARENTS INDULGED
HAPPY AND FORTUNATE WERE THE TIMES WHEN THAT MOST DARING KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS SENT INTO THE WORLD
AND WHOM I ENTREATED TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE CITY WHERE I HEARD MY ENEMY WAS
AND ONE OF HIS VASSALS I TOLD HIM NOT TO LET MY BEAUTY SUCH AS IT WAS BLIND HIM
AND BEGGED HIM IF HE KNEW ANYTHING CONCERNING HER TO TELL IT TO HER AT ONCE FOR IF FORTUNE HAD LEFT HER ANY BLESSING IT WAS COURAGE TO BEAR WHATEVER CALAMITY MIGHT FALL UPON HER AS SHE FELT SURE THAT NONE COULD REACH HER CAPABLE OF INCREASING IN ANY DEGREE WHAT SHE ENDURED ALREADY
AND TAKING HIS STOUT PIKESTAFF IN HIS HAND HE SET FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY ONCE MORE AS THOUGH HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IN THE GOOD TOWN OF BLYTH THERE LIVED A STOUT TANNER CELEBRATED FAR AND NEAR FOR FEATS OF STRENGTH AND MANY TOUGH BOUTS AT WRESTLING AND THE QUARTERSTAFF
AND THAT ON THE BRIDEGROOM APPROACHING TO UNLACE THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS TO GIVE HER AIR
I DID THINK THERE WAS NEVER A MAN IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE COULD DO TO ME WHAT THOU HAST DONE THIS DAY AND SO THOUGHT I ALSO CRIED ROBIN HOOD BURSTING OUT OF THE THICKET AND SHOUTING WITH LAUGHTER TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS
BIDED AT THE BLUE BOAR INN UNTIL THE MORROW NOW IT WAS AN ILL PIECE OF LUCK FOR LITTLE JOHN THAT HE LEFT HIS DUTY FOR HIS PLEASURE AND HE PAID A GREAT SCORE FOR IT AS WE ARE ALL APT TO DO IN THE SAME CASE AS YOU SHALL SEE
CRUSH CLODS OR TO FOLLOW THE PLOUGH AND THE OXEN AS THEIR OWNER'S DRESS SUGGESTED AND SO FINDING THEY HAD NOT BEEN NOTICED THE CURATE WHO WAS IN FRONT MADE A SIGN TO THE OTHER TWO TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES BEHIND SOME FRAGMENTS OF ROCK THAT LAY THERE
AND BATS FLEW IN AND OUT LIKE DOVES OUT OF A DOVE COTE THE NIGHT HAD BEGUN TO FALL AS I GOT CLOSE AND IN THREE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS WHICH WERE VERY HIGH UP AND NARROW AND WELL BARRED THE CHANGING LIGHT OF A LITTLE FIRE BEGAN TO GLIMMER
HE WAS NOT USED TO SEEING THE CAT FEARING LITTLE CREATURES RUNNING ABOUT IN THEIR BONES AND HOW COULD HE EVER HAVE IMAGINED THEIR NECKS TO BE SO QUEER BESIDES THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY THERE WAS SAINT PETER'S CHURCH TO BE VISITED
IT BEWILDERS ONE TO LOOK AT THEM HELP ME TO COUNT ALL THOSE WE CAN SEE VAN MOUNEN I WANT A BIG ITEM FOR MY NOTEBOOK AND AFTER A CAREFUL RECKONING
THE TOWER STOOD HIGHER WHEN MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES AGO THE INHABITANTS OF BELEAGUERED LEYDEN SHOUTED TO THE WATCHER ON ITS TOP THEIR WILD DESPAIRING CRIES IS THERE ANY HELP ARE THE WATERS RISING
IN THE MEANTIME THE SUPERVISOR RODE ON AS FAST AS HE COULD TO KITT'S HOLE BUT HIS MEN HAD TO DISMOUNT AND GROPE DOWN THE DINGLE LEADING AND SOMETIMES SUPPORTING THEIR HORSES AND IN CONTINUAL FEAR OF AMBUSHES
CONTAINING PROFESSOR LUZAC'S MEMORIAL AND BOERHAAVE'S MONUMENT OF WHITE AND BLACK MARBLE WITH ITS URN AND CARVED SYMBOLS OF THE FOUR AGES OF LIFE AND ITS MEDALLION OF BOERHAAVE ADORNED WITH HIS FAVORITE MOTTO
WELL THEN HAWKINS WHAT IN FORTUNE WERE THEY AFTER MORE MONEY I SUPPOSE NO SIR NOT MONEY I THINK REPLIED I

WELL I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT WAS THERE WAS A BIG STONE LYING ON THE WALL AND I PUT MY MY FOOT OUT JUST TO PUSH IT A LITTLE YOU SEE AND THE FIRST THING I KNEW
AND AT THE SAME TIME A BULLET WHISTLED CLOSE BY HIS ARM SOON AFTER THE LUGGER DOUBLED THE POINT AND DISAPPEARED MISTER DANCE STOOD THERE AS HE SAID LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER
THE HOUSE IS A BIG MUCKLE HOUSE AY SAID I BUT THE FOLK THAT ARE IN IT FOLK CRIED HE
THE FIRE AND THE BRIGHT LIGHTS WOULD SHOW A MILE AWAY AND THE DOOR OPEN TO A BEGGAR'S KNOCK I CAME FORWARD CAUTIOUSLY
KNEW NO BETTER THAN TO BE VENTURESOME WHY LET HIM TUMBLE HORROR WHAT MEAN THAT HEAVY CRASHING SOUND BEN COULD NOT STIR HE COULD ONLY GASP JACOB JACOB CRIED ANOTHER STARTLED VOICE
OF WHAT A PERPLEXING LANGUAGE IT IS SURELY THERE IS NOT ANOTHER LANGUAGE THAT IS SO SLIPSHOD AND SYSTEMLESS AND SO SLIPPERY AND ELUSIVE TO THE GRASP ONE IS WASHED ABOUT IN IT
WEARING AN EMBROIDERED COURT UNIFORM KNEE BREECHES AND SHOES AND HAD STARS ON HIS BREAST AND A SERENE EXPRESSION ON HIS FLAT FACE HE SPOKE IN THAT REFINED FRENCH IN WHICH OUR GRANDFATHERS NOT ONLY SPOKE BUT THOUGHT
AFTER HAVING BEEN MOST INHUMANLY TREATED IN BERKELEY CASTLE WHITHER HE HAD BEEN REMOVED THUS ENDS THE SAD HISTORY OF A MONARCH WHO MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED IN A MINOR POSITION ON A HEN FARM BUT WHO MADE A BEASTLY FLUKE IN THE KING BUSINESS
LITTLE LEARNING MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD KIN PROVERBS
WHO DRESSED IN SIMPLE WHITE MUSLIN WITH A SINGLE TUBEROSE IN THE AMPLE FOLDS OF HER RICH BROWN HAIR HAD TOTTERED FEEBLY DOWN THE STAIRS STILL PALE FROM THE TERROR AND EXCITEMENT OF THE PAST EVENING
BUT EVEN AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE LAW OF COPERNICUS
HE FROWNED WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO HE SAID AT LAST YOU KNOW I DID ALL A FATHER COULD FOR THEIR EDUCATION AND THEY HAVE BOTH TURNED OUT FOOLS HIPPOLYTE IS AT LEAST A QUIET FOOL
THAT IT IS NO MOONLIGHT FROLIC EDWARD FLED TO WALES
SERVING AS THE MEASURE OF VISIBLE PHENOMENA IN ASTRONOMY
WHEN HE STARTS OUT TO SAY THAT A MAN MET A COUNSELOR'S WIFE IN THE STREET AND THEN RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF THIS SO SIMPLE UNDERTAKING HALTS THESE APPROACHING PEOPLE AND MAKES THEM STAND STILL
SIT DOWN AND TELL ME ALL THE NEWS IT WAS IN JULY EIGHTEEN O FIVE AND THE SPEAKER WAS THE WELL KNOWN ANNA PAVLOVNA SCHERER MAID OF HONOR AND FAVORITE OF THE EMPRESS MARYA FEDOROVNA WITH THESE WORDS SHE GREETED PRINCE VASILI KURAGIN
WITHOUT HYPHENS IT TREATS OF FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN DIFFERENT SUBJECTS EACH ENCLOSED IN A PARENTHESIS OF ITS OWN WITH HERE AND THERE EXTRA PARENTHESES
LISTEN DEAR ANNETTE SAID THE PRINCE SUDDENLY TAKING ANNA PAVLOVNA'S HAND AND FOR SOME REASON DRAWING IT DOWNWARDS ARRANGE THAT AFFAIR FOR ME AND I SHALL ALWAYS BE YOUR MOST DEVOTED SLAVE
NOR COULD NOR CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO CORRECT IN THE MIDST OF A CONVERSATION ON POLITICAL MATTERS ANNA PAVLOVNA BURST OUT OH DON'T SPEAK TO ME OF AUSTRIA PERHAPS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THINGS
HE ISN'T DROWNED SAID THE PORPOISES IF HE WERE WE WOULD BE SURE TO HAVE HEARD OF IT FROM THE DEEP SEA DECAPODS WE HEAR ALL THE SALT WATER NEWS THE SHELL FISH CALL US THE OCEAN GOSSIPS NO TELL THE LITTLE BOY WE ARE SORRY WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE HIS UNCLE IS
THEY LOOKED IN ALL THE CUPBOARDS AND DRAWERS AND LOCKERS IN THE BIG CHESTS IN THE SHIP'S DINING ROOM THEY LOOKED EVERYWHERE WHILE THEY WERE DOING THIS THEY DISCOVERED A LOT OF NEW AND WONDERFUL THINGS THAT THE PIRATES MUST HAVE STOLEN FROM OTHER SHIPS
AND THAT'S SOMETHING PERHAPS WE CAN FIND HIM FOR YOU FIRST WE'LL GO AND HAVE TEA WITH STRAWBERRY JAM
THIS IS DAB DAB ONE OF MY PETS I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT DUCKS HAD A LANGUAGE SAID THE BOY ARE ALL THESE OTHER ANIMALS YOUR PETS TOO WHAT IS THAT STRANGE LOOKING THING WITH TWO HEADS
THAT MAY BE UPHELD BY LEARNED MEN WHILE THERE CAN BE BUT ONE TRUE I RECKONED AS WELL NIGH FALSE ALL THAT WAS ONLY PROBABLE AS TO THE OTHER SCIENCES
I HAD ALWAYS A MOST EARNEST DESIRE TO KNOW HOW TO DISTINGUISH THE TRUE FROM THE FALSE IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE CLEARLY TO DISCRIMINATE THE RIGHT PATH IN LIFE AND PROCEED IN IT WITH CONFIDENCE IT IS TRUE THAT
AND THEY THINK THEY'RE GOOD HEARERS
TREATING OF SUCH BRANCHES AS ARE ESTEEMED THE MOST CURIOUS AND RARE I KNEW THE JUDGMENT WHICH OTHERS HAD FORMED OF ME AND I DID NOT FIND THAT I WAS CONSIDERED INFERIOR TO MY FELLOWS
EMBROIDERED WITH FLOWERS OF GOLD JARS OF FINE TOBACCO FROM JAMAICA CARVED IVORY BOXES FULL OF RUSSIAN TEA AN OLD VIOLIN WITH A STRING BROKEN AND A PICTURE ON THE BACK
ASKED THE PORPOISES YES SAID THE DOCTOR THAT'S THE MAN HAS HE BEEN DROWNED
COME DOWN AND SEE IF YOU CAN LET US IN SO THE DOCTOR WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND HE SAW THAT IT WAS INDEED A BEAUTIFUL SHIP HE FOUND THE ANIMALS GATHERED ROUND A LITTLE DOOR ALL TALKING AT ONCE TRYING TO GUESS WHAT WAS INSIDE
MY UNCLE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN I ASKED THE PIRATES WHERE HE WAS BUT THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME I AM VERY MUCH AFRAID THEY THREW HIM INTO THE SEA AND DROWNED HIM
THAN THAT THEY FOSTER HIS VANITY THE BETTER THE MORE REMOTE THEY ARE FROM COMMON SENSE REQUIRING AS THEY MUST IN THIS CASE THE EXERCISE OF GREATER INGENUITY AND ART TO RENDER THEM PROBABLE IN ADDITION
THE TWO FELL IN WITH ONE ANOTHER IN MESSENE AT THE HOUSE OF ORTILOCHUS
AS HE HAD BIDDEN HER AND ULYSSES THOROUGHLY PURIFIED THE CLOISTERS AND BOTH THE INNER AND OUTER COURTS THEN SHE WENT INSIDE TO CALL THE WOMEN AND TELL THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEREON THEY CAME FROM THEIR APARTMENT
BY AND BY MELANTHIUS CAME OUT WITH A HELMET IN ONE HAND AND AN OLD DRY ROTTED SHIELD IN THE OTHER
THIS DONE HE WENT ON TO THE PAVEMENT TO MAKE TRIAL OF THE BOW THRICE DID HE TUG AT IT TRYING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT TO DRAW THE STRING AND THRICE HE HAD TO LEAVE OFF
THAT HE IS OF NOBLE BIRTH GIVE HIM THE BOW AND LET US SEE WHETHER HE CAN STRING IT OR NO I SAY AND IT SHALL SURELY BE THAT IF APOLLO
WE WILL NOT LET YOUR SONS LIVE IN YOUR HOUSE NOR YOUR DAUGHTERS NOR SHALL YOUR WIDOW
BUT THE SWINEHERD SAW HIM AND SAID TO ULYSSES WHO WAS BESIDE HIM ULYSSES
I SHALL DIE WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT AND SHALL HAVE GOT NO THANKS FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT I DID ULYSSES LOOKED STERNLY AT HIM AND ANSWERED IF YOU WERE THEIR SACRIFICING PRIEST YOU MUST HAVE PRAYED MANY A TIME
HE SHED THE ARROWS ON TO THE GROUND AT HIS FEET AND SAID THE MIGHTY CONTEST IS AT AN END I WILL NOW SEE WHETHER APOLLO WILL VOUCHSAFE IT TO ME TO HIT ANOTHER MARK WHICH NO MAN HAS YET HIT
TELEMACHUS DID AS HIS FATHER SAID AND WENT OFF TO THE STORE ROOM WHERE THE ARMOUR WAS KEPT HE CHOSE FOUR SHIELDS EIGHT SPEARS AND FOUR BRASS HELMETS WITH HORSE HAIR PLUMES HE BROUGHT THEM WITH ALL SPEED TO HIS FATHER
I GRIEVE THAT I SHALL HAVE TO FORGO THE MARRIAGE BUT I DO NOT CARE NEARLY SO MUCH ABOUT THIS FOR THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER WOMEN IN ITHACA AND ELSEWHERE WHAT I FEEL MOST IS THE FACT OF OUR BEING SO INFERIOR TO ULYSSES IN STRENGTH
BUT ALL THE TIME HE WAS EXPECTING TO BE ABLE TO STRING THE BOW AND SHOOT THROUGH THE IRON
THE WINE MUST HAVE BEEN DOING YOU A MISCHIEF
TO ACCEPT YOUR KIND INVITATION FOR NOWHERE IN THE LAND OF OZ COULD I HOPE TO MEET WITH SO CONGENIAL A COMPANY THAT IS TRUE ACKNOWLEDGED THE PUMPKINHEAD WE ARE QUITE AS CONGENIAL AS FLIES AND HONEY
AND ARE RUNNING THINGS TO SUIT THEMSELVES DEAR ME WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY IDEA CRIED THE EMPEROR WHO WAS BOTH SHOCKED
BUT TELL ME HOW CAME YOUR MAJESTY HERE AND WHO ARE YOUR COMPANIONS THE SCARECROW WITH GREAT POLITENESS INTRODUCED TIP AND JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND THE LATTER PERSONAGE SEEMED TO INTEREST THE TIN WOODMAN GREATLY
I BEG YOU TO BE MORE CAREFUL IN YOUR SPEECH SAID THE PUMPKINHEAD SHARPLY REMEMBER IF YOU PLEASE THAT IT IS MY LEG YOU ARE ABUSING I CANNOT FORGET IT RETORTED THE SAW HORSE
IT WAS THROUGH THIS GATEWAY HIS MAJESTY PROPOSED TO ESCAPE AND THE ROYAL ARMY NOW LED THE SAW HORSE ALONG THE PASSAGE
WHICH SMARTED FOR AN HOUR AFTERWARD BUT THE NEEDLES HAD NO EFFECT UPON THE SCARECROW OR JACK PUMPKINHEAD WHO NEVER EVEN SUSPECTED THEY WERE BEING PRODDED AS FOR THE SAW HORSE HE MADE A WONDERFUL RECORD UPSETTING A FRUIT CART
SO WHEN THE JACKDAWS NEARLY KNOCKED HIM DOWN IN THEIR RUSH OF WINGS AND THEIR SHARP BEAKS AND CLAWS THREATENED TO DAMAGE HIS BRILLIANT PLATING THE WOODMAN PICKED UP HIS AXE AND MADE IT WHIRL SWIFTLY AROUND HIS HEAD
WHY NOT USE ONE OF HIS LEGS TO MAKE A LEG FOR THE HORSE THAT CARRIES HIM I JUDGE THAT BOTH ARE MADE OF WOOD NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL REAL CLEVERNESS SAID THE SCARECROW APPROVINGLY I WONDER MY BRAINS DID NOT THINK OF THAT LONG AGO
AS COOLLY AS IF NO DANGER THREATENED HIS THRONE BUT THE PUMPKINHEAD HAVING CAUGHT SIGHT OF TIP AMBLED TOWARD THE BOY AS FAST AS HIS WOODEN LEGS WOULD GO GOOD AFTERNOON NOBLE PARENT HE CRIED DELIGHTEDLY
THE INVADING ARMY ENTERED THE CITY MORE SLOWLY FOR THEY STOPPED TO DIG EMERALDS OUT OF THE WALLS AND PAVING STONES WITH THE POINTS OF THEIR KNITTING NEEDLES SO THE SOLDIER AND THE BOY REACHED THE PALACE BEFORE THE NEWS HAD SPREAD THAT THE CITY WAS CONQUERED
AND THEY FLED SCREAMING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WHEN THE LAST FOE HAD DISAPPEARED TIP CRAWLED FROM UNDER THE SOFAS AND ASSISTED THE WOGGLE BUG TO FOLLOW HIM
SUGGESTED TIP I CAN'T SAID THE SCARECROW WHY NOT YOU'VE A MOUTH HAVEN'T YOU ASKED THE BOY YES BUT MY MOUTH IS PAINTED ON AND THERE'S NO SWALLOW CONNECTED WITH IT ANSWERED THE SCARECROW IN FACT HE CONTINUED
FOR NO MAN COULD FACE THE TERRIBLE WEAPONS OF THE INVADERS WELL SAID THE SCARECROW AFTER A MOMENT'S THOUGHT
IT IS TOO LATE TO ESCAPE THEY WOULD SOON TEAR YOU TO PIECES THE SCARECROW SIGHED IN AN EMERGENCY HE ANNOUNCED IT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING TO PAUSE AND REFLECT
AND GATHERING HER WORK TOGETHER SHE WAS HASTENING AWAY WHEN ELIZABETH CALLED OUT DEAR MADAM DO NOT GO I BEG YOU WILL NOT GO MISTER COLLINS MUST EXCUSE ME HE CAN HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO ME THAT ANYBODY NEED NOT HEAR I AM GOING AWAY MYSELF
DINING OUT SAID MISSUS BENNET THAT IS VERY UNLUCKY CAN I HAVE THE CARRIAGE SAID JANE NO MY DEAR YOU HAD BETTER GO ON HORSEBACK BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKELY TO RAIN AND THEN YOU MUST STAY ALL NIGHT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD SCHEME SAID ELIZABETH
ON THE FIRST APPLICATION AND PERHAPS YOU HAVE EVEN NOW SAID AS MUCH TO ENCOURAGE MY SUIT AS WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE TRUE DELICACY OF THE FEMALE CHARACTER REALLY MISTER COLLINS CRIED ELIZABETH WITH SOME WARMTH YOU PUZZLE ME EXCEEDINGLY
I REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN I LIKED A RED COAT MYSELF VERY WELL AND INDEED SO I DO STILL AT MY HEART AND IF A SMART YOUNG COLONEL WITH FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND A YEAR SHOULD WANT ONE OF MY GIRLS I SHALL NOT SAY NAY TO HIM
AND I THOUGHT COLONEL FORSTER LOOKED VERY BECOMING THE OTHER NIGHT AT SIR WILLIAM'S IN HIS REGIMENTALS MAMMA CRIED LYDIA MY AUNT SAYS THAT COLONEL FORSTER AND CAPTAIN CARTER DO NOT GO SO OFTEN TO MISS WATSON'S AS THEY DID WHEN THEY FIRST CAME
AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM HER MANNERS WERE PRONOUNCED TO BE VERY BAD INDEED A MIXTURE OF PRIDE AND IMPERTINENCE SHE HAD NO CONVERSATION NO STYLE NO BEAUTY MISSUS HURST THOUGHT THE SAME AND ADDED
AND PAY ME THE COMPLIMENT OF BELIEVING WHAT I SAY I WISH YOU VERY HAPPY AND VERY RICH AND BY REFUSING YOUR HAND DO ALL IN MY POWER TO PREVENT YOUR BEING OTHERWISE IN MAKING ME THE OFFER YOU MUST HAVE SATISFIED THE DELICACY OF YOUR FEELINGS WITH REGARD TO MY FAMILY
THAT IT IS THE PARTICULAR ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE VERY NOBLE LADY WHOM I HAVE THE HONOUR OF CALLING PATRONESS TWICE HAS SHE CONDESCENDED TO GIVE ME HER OPINION
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE FOR ME TO STATE MY REASONS FOR MARRYING AND MOREOVER FOR COMING INTO HERTFORDSHIRE WITH THE DESIGN OF SELECTING A WIFE AS I CERTAINLY DID THE IDEA OF MISTER COLLINS WITH ALL HIS SOLEMN COMPOSURE
AND SHE WAS EAGERLY CALLING OUT WHILE HER DAUGHTER READ WELL JANE WHO IS IT FROM WHAT IS IT ABOUT WHAT DOES HE SAY WELL JANE MAKE HASTE AND TELL US MAKE HASTE MY LOVE IT IS FROM MISS BINGLEY SAID JANE AND THEN READ IT ALOUD
DO NOT CONSIDER ME NOW AS AN ELEGANT FEMALE INTENDING TO PLAGUE YOU BUT AS A RATIONAL CREATURE SPEAKING THE TRUTH FROM HER HEART YOU ARE UNIFORMLY CHARMING CRIED HE WITH AN AIR OF AWKWARD GALLANTRY
BUT IN MY OPINION IT IS A PALTRY DEVICE A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED THERE IS A MEANNESS IN ALL THE ARTS WHICH LADIES SOMETIMES CONDESCEND TO EMPLOY FOR CAPTIVATION
BESIDES THE QUESTION WILL ARISE HOW MANY OF THESE BLESSINGS ARE DUE TO CHRISTIANITY AS DISTINCT FROM CIVILIZATION AND SO THE BALANCE SWAYS AND THE STORY RUNS
DONE MY BEST TO LEARN THE WAYS OF THE CHILDREN OF LIGHT AND WHAT HAVE I FOUND A GREAT GULF FIXED NO ONLY A VERY LITTLE ONE THAT A PLAIN MAN'S THOUGHT MAY SPRING ACROSS
AND REALLY I AM AFRAID TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY PUT THEM AT IT SEEMS SO ENORMOUS
SAW US ALL ONCE MORE SAFE AND SOUND AT MY LITTLE PLACE ON THE BEREA NEAR DURBAN WHERE I AM NOW WRITING
ALL THESE THINGS SUGGEST TOUCHES OF KINSHIP AND YOU REMEMBER THAT IN THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF YOUR NATURE YOU ARE QUITE IDENTICAL AS FOR YOU SIR WHO ALSO LAUGH
LYING IN THE CHURCHYARD WITHOUT FEELING AS THOUGH MY HEART WOULD BREAK IN TWO AND NOW THERE IS AN END OF THIS EGOTISTICAL TALK AND THERE SHALL BE NO MORE OF IT
FETCHED UP ALL RIGHT IN ENGLAND WE GOT OFF THE BOAT AT SOUTHAMPTON AND WENT UP TO TOWN YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT A SWELL

AND BEGAN HOBBLING TOWARDS US WHEN HE WAS CLOSE HE FELL DOWN IN A SORT OF FAINT WITH A SPRING SIR HENRY WAS BY HIS SIDE GREAT POWERS HE CRIED
OR DISPERSED FOR THEIR HASTY JUDGMENT UPON THE SUPPOSED ASSASSINS THE PALACE WAS RAZED TO THE GROUND THE FLOURISHING TOWN TURNED INTO A DESERT AND THE DOWAGER CZARINA FORCED INTO A CONVENT
ARE YOU NOT ASHAMED TO APPEAR BEFORE MY EYES I WILL SEND YOU TO A THIRD MASTER BUT IF YOU LEARN NOTHING THIS TIME ALSO I WILL NO LONGER BE YOUR FATHER THE YOUTH REMAINED A WHOLE YEAR WITH THE THIRD MASTER ALSO
HE DID IT THOROUGHLY AND BROUGHT A CHEST FULL OF GOLD OUT WITH HIM THE HOWLING OF THE WILD DOGS WAS HENCEFORTH HEARD NO MORE THEY HAD DISAPPEARED AND THE COUNTRY WAS FREED FROM THE TROUBLE AFTER SOME TIME
BOUNTIFULLY WITH GOODS AND MONEY AND RENDERED HIM EVERY ASSISTANCE TOWARDS DRIVING OUT LOUIS ALMOST ALL THE TOWNS AND CITIES ACKNOWLEDGED HIS AUTHORITY AND PROMISED OBEDIENCE TO HIS RULE
BUT A STILL MORE FORMIDABLE TEST WAS TO BE UNDERGONE THE DOWAGER CZARINA FORSOOK THE CONVENT
IN A STATE OF INTENSE EXCITEMENT TO SEE
HAD RECOGNIZED HER SON AND THE NEW MONARCH WAS MASTER OF THE SITUATION HE RESPECTFULLY CONDUCTED THE CZARINA TO A CARRIAGE WALKING BARE HEADED BY ITS SIDE IN THE CAPITAL HE TREATED HER WITH EVERY ATTENTION
THE EMPEROR LOUIS ACTING IN OPPOSITION TO ALL RIGHT SAVE THAT OF MIGHT INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THE DULY RECOGNIZED PRINCE TO SUCCEED TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ELECTORATE AND INVESTED HIS OWN SON LOUIS WITH IT
AND WHEN HE CAME HOME AGAIN AND HIS FATHER INQUIRED MY SON WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNT HE ANSWERED DEAR FATHER I HAVE THIS YEAR LEARNT WHAT THE FROGS CROAK
THE KING OF DENMARK WHO SINGULARLY ENOUGH WAS ALSO NAMED VOLDEMAR AND BY SOME OTHER POTENTATES EQUALLY DESIROUS OF HAVING A HAND IN THEIR NEIGHBOUR'S AFFAIRS HE SOON FOUND HIMSELF ABLE TO PLACE A GOOD ARMY IN THE FIELD
IN THE CHAPEL DU SAINT ESPRIT WHICH WAS THE GENERAL PLACE OF SEPULTURE
THE ABSENT ELECTOR APPARENTLY UNCONSCIOUS OF THE SAD EVENT DID NOT RETURN AND IT WAS QUICKLY NOISED ABROAD HAD ALSO MET WITH A SUDDEN DEATH
AFTER TWELVE HOURS HAD GONE BY WE HAD REMOVED FROM THE OUTLINED SURFACE AREA A SLICE OF ICE ONLY ONE METER THICK HENCE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED CUBIC METERS ASSUMING THE SAME WORK WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED EVERY TWELVE HOURS
THE NAUTILUS'S CHIEF OFFICER SUPERVISED US THE WATER STRUCK ME AS UNUSUALLY COLD BUT I WARMED UP PROMPTLY WHILE WIELDING MY PICK MY MOVEMENTS WERE QUITE FREE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE EXECUTED UNDER A PRESSURE OF THIRTY ATMOSPHERES
SOME OF THESE JELLYFISH WERE SHAPED LIKE VERY SMOOTH SEMISPHERIC PARASOLS WITH RUSSET STRIPES AND FRINGES OF TWELVE NEAT FESTOONS OTHERS LOOKED LIKE
WHEN THE NAUTILUS ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES A FEW MINUTES BEFORE NOON WE RAISED LAND TO THE WEST
WHEN I NOTED THAT LITTLE BY LITTLE THE SIDE WALLS WERE CLOSING IN ON EACH OTHER THE LIQUID STRATA FARTHEST FROM THE TRENCH NOT WARMED BY THE MOVEMENTS OF WORKMEN AND TOOLS WERE SHOWING A TENDENCY TO SOLIDIFY IN THE FACE OF THIS IMMINENT NEW DANGER
MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED METERS HIGH
BUT THEY'LL SUPPLY AIR FOR ONLY TWO DAYS NOW THEN WE'VE BEEN BURIED BENEATH THE WATERS FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS AND THE NAUTILUS'S HEAVY ATMOSPHERE ALREADY NEEDS RENEWING IN ANOTHER FORTY EIGHT HOURS OUR RESERVE AIR WILL BE USED UP
IN THESE WATERWAYS OUR NETS BROUGHT UP FINE SAMPLES OF ALGAE IN PARTICULAR CERTAIN FUCUS PLANTS WHOSE ROOTS WERE LADEN WITH THE WORLD'S BEST MUSSELS
WHEN HIS TIME WAS UP HE YIELDED HIS EQUIPMENT TO ANOTHER AND REENTERED THE FOUL AIR ON BOARD ALWAYS CALM UNFLINCHING AND UNCOMPLAINING THAT DAY THE USUAL WORK WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITH EVEN GREATER ENERGY
AFTER I MONITORED THE OPERATION'S PROGRESS DOUBLE CHECKING IT WITH MANY INSPECTIONS I TOLD THE CAPTAIN IT'S WORKING I THINK SO HE ANSWERED ME WE'VE ESCAPED BEING CRUSHED NOW WE HAVE ONLY ASPHYXIATION TO FEAR
THESE CHUNKS WEIGHED LESS THAN THE WATER AND BY AN UNUSUAL EFFECT OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY EACH CHUNK TOOK WING AS IT WERE TO THE ROOF OF THE TUNNEL
BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD RETURN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES COULDN'T WE ALL DIE OF ASPHYXIATION WERE THIS SHIP AND EVERYONE ON BOARD DOOMED TO PERISH IN THIS TOMB OF ICE IT WAS A DREADFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS BUT WE FACED IT HEAD ON
IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY IN A MANNER OF CONFOUNDED BY THIS LAPSE INTO BANALITY CONSEIL LEFT HIS SENTENCE HANGING MY FRIENDS I REPLIED VERY MOVED
I AM AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS TOO I BELIEVE AND I MUST OWN I FEEL HURT THAT YOU HAVE LEFT ME OUT I SAID BOILING OVER AGAIN AND WHERE WERE WE TO FIND YOU FERFITCHKIN PUT IN ROUGHLY YOU NEVER WERE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ZVERKOV TRUDOLYUBOV ADDED FROWNING
MUCH THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL SOMETHING IN THE MANFRED STYLE EVERYONE WOULD KISS ME AND WEEP
I CAME IN FOR COUNTLESS MILLIONS AND IMMEDIATELY DEVOTED THEM TO HUMANITY AND AT THE SAME TIME I CONFESSED BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE MY SHAMEFUL DEEDS WHICH OF COURSE WERE NOT MERELY SHAMEFUL BUT HAD IN THEM
JUST BECAUSE HE WAS A PRETTY AND PLAYFUL BOY HE WAS ALWAYS BAD AT HIS LESSONS AND GOT WORSE AND WORSE AS HE WENT ON HOWEVER HE LEFT WITH A GOOD CERTIFICATE AS HE HAD POWERFUL INTERESTS DURING HIS LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL HE CAME IN FOR AN ESTATE OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS
I STOLE THE BRUSHES TO CLEAN THEM FROM THE PASSAGE BEING CAREFUL HE SHOULD NOT DETECT IT FOR FEAR OF HIS CONTEMPT
WITH YEARS A CRAVING FOR SOCIETY FOR FRIENDS DEVELOPED IN ME I ATTEMPTED TO GET ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH SOME OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER MY INTIMACY WITH THEM WAS ALWAYS STRAINED AND SOON ENDED OF ITSELF
I WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL BY DISTANT RELATIONS UPON WHOM I WAS DEPENDENT AND OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE THEY SENT ME THERE A FORLORN SILENT BOY ALREADY CRUSHED BY THEIR REPROACHES ALREADY TROUBLED BY DOUBT
I KNEW TOO PERFECTLY WELL EVEN THEN THAT I WAS MONSTROUSLY EXAGGERATING THE FACTS BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT
BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT SUCH REFLECTIONS IMPELLED ME AS THOUGH PURPOSELY TO PUT MYSELF INTO A FALSE POSITION I WENT IN
BY THEN HE HAD TAKEN TO CUTTING ME IN THE STREET AND I SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF COMPROMISING HIMSELF BY GREETING A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT AS ME I SAW HIM ONCE IN THE THEATRE IN THE THIRD TIER OF BOXES
OF DOMINATING THEM CARRYING THEM AWAY MAKING THEM LIKE ME IF ONLY FOR MY ELEVATION OF THOUGHT AND UNMISTAKABLE WIT THEY WOULD ABANDON ZVERKOV HE WOULD SIT ON ONE SIDE SILENT AND ASHAMED WHILE I SHOULD CRUSH HIM THEN PERHAPS
BY SOME EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCE ALL THIS WOULD SUDDENLY OPEN OUT EXPAND THAT SUDDENLY A VISTA OF SUITABLE ACTIVITY BENEFICENT GOOD AND ABOVE ALL READY MADE WHAT SORT OF ACTIVITY I HAD NO IDEA
ONE COULD SEE THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS THIRTY HE WOULD BE CORPULENT
WILL YOU PAY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION NOW I JUST ASK SO AS TO KNOW HE MUTTERED IN EMBARRASSMENT I FLUSHED CRIMSON AS I DID SO I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OWED SIMONOV FIFTEEN ROUBLES FOR AGES
CHILDREN YES SHE WANTED THEM BUT SHE WAS NOT QUITE READY SHE HAD BEEN EMBARRASSED BY KENNICOTT'S FRANKNESS BUT SHE AGREED WITH HIM THAT IN THE INSANE CONDITION OF CIVILIZATION
THE FARMERS CAME INTO TOWN IN HOME MADE SLEIGHS WITH BED QUILTS AND HAY PILED IN THE ROUGH BOXES FUR COATS FUR CAPS FUR MITTENS OVERSHOES BUCKLING ALMOST TO THE KNEES GRAY KNITTED SCARFS TEN FEET LONG THICK WOOLEN SOCKS
AND TAR BAGS IN CLOSETS AND ALL OVER TOWN SMALL BOYS WERE SQUEALING OH THERE'S MY MITTENS OR LOOK AT MY SHOE PACKS THERE IS SO SHARP A DIVISION BETWEEN THE PANTING SUMMER AND THE STINGING WINTER OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS
THAT THEY REDISCOVERED WITH SURPRISE AND A FEELING OF HEROISM THIS ARMOR OF AN ARTIC EXPLORER WINTER GARMENTS SURPASSED EVEN PERSONAL GOSSIP AS THE TOPIC AT PARTIES IT WAS GOOD FORM TO ASK PUT ON YOUR HEAVIES YET
BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID THAT THE FARMERS HE IS ORGANIZING WILL DEPRIVE YOU TOWNSMEN OF THE MONEY YOU MAKE OUT OF MORTGAGES AND WHEAT AND SHOPS OF COURSE SINCE WE'RE AT WAR WITH GERMANY ANYTHING THAT ANY ONE OF US DOESN'T LIKE IS PRO GERMAN
AND THEY'D HAVE ANOTHER SKIING EXPEDITION RIGHT AWAY AND THEY JOLLILY RETURNED HOME AND NEVER THEREAFTER LEFT THEIR MANUALS OF BRIDGE CAROL WAS DISCOURAGED SHE WAS GRATEFUL WHEN KENNICOTT INVITED HER TO GO RABBIT HUNTING IN THE WOODS
IN THE EARLY AUTUMN NEWS CAME FROM WAKAMIN THAT THE SHERIFF HAD FORBIDDEN AN ORGANIZER FOR THE NATIONAL NONPARTISAN LEAGUE TO SPEAK ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTY THE ORGANIZER HAD DEFIED THE SHERIFF
SO HAVE I TO MINE WELL I HAVE A RIGHT TO MY LIFE AND YOU'RE IT YOU'RE MY LIFE YOU'VE MADE YOURSELF SO I'M DAMNED IF I'LL AGREE TO ALL YOUR FREAK NOTIONS BUT I WILL SAY I'VE GOT TO DEPEND ON YOU
FLATLY WE'RE GOING TO FIND ELEPHANTS WITH GOLDEN HOWDAHS FROM WHICH PEEP YOUNG MAHARANEES WITH NECKLACES OF RUBIES AND A DAWN SEA COLORED LIKE THE BREAST OF A DOVE
HE WENT OFF ON COUNTRY CALLS IN A SHINY FLORAL STEEL TIPPED CUTTER ONLY HIS RUDDY NOSE AND HIS CIGAR EMERGING FROM THE FUR CAROL HERSELF STIRRED MAIN STREET BY A LOOSE COAT OF NUTRIA HER FINGER TIPS LOVED THE SILKEN FUR
DO YOU MIND TELLING ME IF IT ISN'T TOO MUCH TROUBLE HOW LONG YOU'RE GOING FOR I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS FOR A YEAR PERHAPS FOR A LIFETIME I SEE WELL OF COURSE I'LL BE TICKLED TO DEATH TO SELL OUT MY PRACTISE AND GO ANYWHERE YOU SAY
THE WORLD WAS SO LUMINOUS THAT SHE SAT DOWN AT HER RICKETY LITTLE DESK IN THE LIVING ROOM TO MAKE A POEM SHE GOT NO FARTHER THAN THE SKY IS BRIGHT THE SUN IS WARM THERE NE'ER WILL BE ANOTHER STORM
IN ORDER THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK STRAIGHT ON WITHOUT INTERRUPTION AND DECEIVE THE EARS OF THE MULTITUDE BY SEDUCTIVE ARGUMENTS WHICH WOULD PASS WITHOUT REFUTATION FOR WE KNOW THAT THIS IS THE MEANING OF OUR BEING BROUGHT BEFORE THE FEW
AND HOW THE TOWN LAY ON THE SIDE OF THRACE HE THOUGHT TO RETIRE AT PLEASURE WITHOUT FIGHTING AS THERE WAS NO ONE TO BE SEEN UPON THE WALL OR COMING OUT OF THE GATES ALL OF WHICH WERE SHUT INDEED
THAT HAS MADE THE ENEMY MARCH UP TO THE PLACE AND CARELESSLY LOOK ABOUT HIM AS HE IS DOING WITHOUT NOTICING US BUT THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SOLDIER WILL ALWAYS BE THE MAN WHO MOST HAPPILY DETECTS A BLUNDER LIKE THIS
IS OUR BEST CHANCE OF ESTABLISHING A PANIC AMONG THEM AS A FRESH ASSAILANT HAS ALWAYS MORE TERRORS FOR AN ENEMY THAN THE ONE HE IS IMMEDIATELY ENGAGED WITH SHOW YOURSELF A BRAVE MAN AS A SPARTAN SHOULD
IF ONLY FOR VERY SHAME TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR KINDRED OUR CONFIDENCE THEREFORE AFTER ALL IS NOT SO UTTERLY IRRATIONAL ATHENIANS
SINCE IN TOO MANY CASES THE VERY MEN THAT HAVE THEIR EYES PERFECTLY OPEN TO WHAT THEY ARE RUSHING INTO LET THE THING CALLED DISGRACE BY THE MERE INFLUENCE OF A SEDUCTIVE NAME
DESPISING THE SCANTY NUMBERS OF HIS OPPONENT WOULD MARCH AGAINST AMPHIPOLIS WITH THE FORCE THAT HE HAD GOT WITH HIM
AND ALSO FELL IN WITH SOME LOCRIAN SETTLERS EXILED FROM MESSINA WHO HAD BEEN SENT THITHER WHEN THE LOCRIANS WERE CALLED IN BY ONE OF THE FACTIONS THAT DIVIDED MESSINA AFTER THE PACIFICATION OF SICILY
AS ALREADY COMING TO PASS AND AS YOU HAVE STAKED MOST ON AND TRUSTED MOST IN
THE FLOWER OF THE ATHENIAN ARMY BEING IN THE FIELD WITH THE BEST OF THE LEMNIANS AND IMBRIANS HE THEREFORE PREPARED TO ASSAIL THEM BY STRATAGEM BY SHOWING THE ENEMY THE NUMBER OF HIS TROOPS AND THE SHIFTS
AFTER REMAINING QUIET FOR SOME TIME
WHICH LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT SHAME WILL MAKE THEM HELP YOU HERE WE BLESS YOUR SIMPLICITY BUT DO NOT ENVY YOUR FOLLY THE LACEDAEMONIANS WHEN THEIR OWN INTERESTS OR THEIR COUNTRY'S LAWS ARE IN QUESTION
HE NOW SENT ENVOYS TO PERDICCAS TO COMMAND HIS ATTENDANCE WITH AN ARMY AS PROVIDED BY THE ALLIANCE AND OTHERS TO THRACE
AND TEAR THEM TO PIECES O YOU FOOL SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU MAY AS WELL PLANE THE PLANKS FOR OUR COFFINS AND SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE
AND HAD HEARD WHAT THEIR STEPMOTHER HAD SAID TO THEIR FATHER GRETEL WEPT BITTER TEARS AND SAID TO HANSEL NOW ALL IS OVER WITH US BE QUIET GRETEL SAID HANSEL
JUST SIT THERE YOU CHILDREN AND WHEN YOU ARE TIRED YOU MAY SLEEP A LITTLE WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO CUT WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE DONE WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AWAY WHEN IT WAS NOON
THE HAND IN WHICH HE WROTE THE ADDRESS WAS NOT A STEADY ONE BUT WRITE IT HE DID SOMEHOW AND WENT DOWN STAIRS TO OPEN THE STREET DOOR READY FOR THE COMING OF THE POULTERER'S MAN
BUT THEY HAVE A KEEN SCENT LIKE THE BEASTS AND ARE AWARE WHEN HUMAN BEINGS DRAW NEAR WHEN HANSEL AND GRETEL CAME INTO HER NEIGHBOURHOOD SHE LAUGHED WITH MALICE AND SAID MOCKINGLY
YES AND THE BEDPOST WAS HIS OWN THE BED WAS HIS OWN THE ROOM WAS HIS OWN BEST AND HAPPIEST OF ALL THE TIME BEFORE HIM WAS HIS OWN
SO THAT WE CAN PUT THE BREAD IN AND ONCE GRETEL WAS INSIDE SHE INTENDED TO SHUT THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE IN IT AND THEN SHE WOULD EAT HER TOO BUT GRETEL SAW WHAT SHE HAD IN MIND AND SAID
THE WOMAN HOWEVER WAS DEAD GRETEL EMPTIED HER PINAFORE UNTIL PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES RAN ABOUT THE ROOM AND HANSEL THREW ONE HANDFUL AFTER ANOTHER OUT OF HIS POCKET TO ADD TO THEM
NOW I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY FRIEND SAID SCROOGE I AM NOT GOING TO STAND THIS SORT OF THING ANY LONGER AND THEREFORE HE CONTINUED LEAPING FROM HIS STOOL
NOW CHILDREN LAY YOURSELVES DOWN BY THE FIRE AND REST WE WILL GO INTO THE FOREST AND CUT SOME WOOD WHEN WE HAVE DONE WE WILL COME BACK AND FETCH YOU AWAY HANSEL AND GRETEL
BUT SCOLDED AND REPROACHED HIM HE WHO SAYS A MUST SAY B LIKEWISE AND AS HE HAD YIELDED THE FIRST TIME HE HAD TO DO SO A SECOND TIME ALSO
THE CHILDREN HOWEVER WERE STILL AWAKE AND HAD HEARD THE CONVERSATION WHEN THE OLD FOLKS WERE ASLEEP HANSEL AGAIN GOT UP AND WANTED TO GO OUT AND PICK UP PEBBLES AS HE HAD DONE BEFORE
AND SLID HIMSELF SEIZED HOLD OF HUGE ROCKS WITH HIS CLAWS AND TORE THEM DOWN AND STAMPED THEM UNDER HIS FEET AND WHEN THE TUMULT WAS OVER THE SEA HAD WON
AND THE PEOPLE OF SLID THE FISHES AND THE LONG EELS WENT IN AND OUT OF ARBOURS THAT ONCE WERE DEAR TO THE GODS THEN THE GODS FEARED FOR THEIR DOMINION AND TO THE INNERMOST SACRED RECESSES OF THE MOUNTAINS TO THE VERY HEART OF THE HILLS THE GODS TROOPED OFF TOGETHER
IN THE NIGHT TIME TIP TOED INTO THE ROOM AND TOOK THE BALL GENTLY FOR HE WAS A GOD AWAY FROM UNDER THE PILLOW AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DAWNCHILD TO GLEAM ON AN ONYX STEP
THAT IT WAS MERE PROFESSIONAL CLAPTRAP I DON'T KNOW THAT I CARED WHAT BECAME OF YOU WHEN I RENDERED IT MIND I SAY WHEN I RENDERED IT I AM SPEAKING OF THE PAST YOU MAKE LIGHT OF THE OBLIGATION RETURNED DARNAY BUT I WILL NOT QUARREL WITH YOUR LIGHT ANSWER
AND THE CHILD CRIED AND THREW IT UPON THE STAIRWAY AND CHIPPED AND BROKE ITS EDGES AND ASKED FOR THE GOLDEN BALL AND LIMPANG TUNG
AND EVER THE TRAMP OF HIS ARMIES SOUNDED NEARER AND NEARER IN THE LISTENING EARS OF THE GODS THEN THE GODS CALLED TO THEIR DOWNLANDS TO SAVE THEIR WORLD FROM SLID AND THE DOWNLANDS GATHERED THEMSELVES AND MARCHED AWAY A GREAT WHITE LINE OF GLEAMING CLIFFS
ALWAYS AND VERY LENIENT ON HIS FAULTS WHEN HE IS NOT BY I WOULD ASK YOU TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAS A HEART HE VERY VERY SELDOM REVEALS AND THAT THERE ARE DEEP WOUNDS IN IT MY DEAR I HAVE SEEN IT BLEEDING IT IS A PAINFUL REFLECTION TO ME
ALL IN A WORLD OF ROCKS UNDER THE RIM OF THE SKY AND SHE WANTED HER GOLDEN BALL AND COULD NOT LOVE THE DARK THEREAT UMBORODOM WHOSE HOUND WAS THE THUNDER TOOK HIS HOUND IN LEASH AND STRODE AWAY ACROSS THE SKY AFTER THE GOLDEN BALL
ONE OF A LARGE NUMBER AS YOU KNOW I WAS INSUFFERABLE ABOUT LIKING YOU AND NOT LIKING YOU I WISH YOU WOULD FORGET IT I FORGOT IT LONG AGO
THE GOLDEN BALL WENT BOUNDING UP THE SKY AND THE DAWNCHILD WITH HER FLARING HAIR STOOD LAUGHING UPON THE STAIRWAY OF THE GODS AND IT WAS DAY SO GLEAMING FIELDS BELOW SAW THE FIRST OF ALL THE DAYS THAT THE GODS HAVE DESTINED
GENUINE TRUTH MISTER DARNAY TRUST ME I HAVE GONE ASIDE FROM MY PURPOSE I WAS SPEAKING ABOUT OUR BEING FRIENDS NOW YOU KNOW ME YOU KNOW I AM INCAPABLE OF ALL THE HIGHER AND BETTER FLIGHTS OF MEN IF YOU DOUBT IT ASK STRYVER AND HE'LL TELL YOU SO
WAS YET THE SADDEST AT THE DAWNCHILD'S GRIEF AND WHEN THE GODS SAID PLAY WITH YOUR SILVER MOON
CALLING THE SOUTH WIND TO THEM AND AGAIN THE GODS SHOUTED ALL TOGETHER MAKING THE CRY OF THE NORTH CALLING THE NORTH WIND TO THEM AND THUS THEY GATHERED TO THEM ALL THEIR WINDS
REMAINED FOR A MOMENT IN SERIOUS AND EXPECTORATIVE CONTEMPLATION OF THE BOOT AND THEN RETURNED TO HIS COLUMN THERE WAS SOMETHING SO WEIRD IN THIS BAPTISM THAT I GREW QUITE NERVOUS PERHAPS I WAS OUT OF SPIRITS
WITH THIS LOAD LIFTED FROM MY MIND AND ASSISTED BY THE MILD PRESENCE OF DIANA WHO LEFT AS WHEN SHE VISITED ENDYMION MUCH OF HER SPLENDOR OUTSIDE MY CAVERN I LOOKED AROUND THE EMPTY VEHICLE ON THE FORWARD SEAT LAY A WOMAN'S HAIRPIN
GUY CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING WITH THE TOWN REALLY NO WE CAN'T HE DISPOSED OF IT LIKE A JUDGE RULING OUT AN IMPROPER OBJECTION RETURNED TO MATTERS LESS UNCOMFORTABLY ENERGETIC CURIOUS
HAD BEGUN TO SEPARATE THE FORMLESS MASSES OF THE SHADOWY LANDSCAPE TREES ISOLATED IN CLUMPS AND ASSEMBLAGES CHANGED PLACES BEFORE MY WINDOW THE SHARP OUTLINES OF THE DISTANT HILLS CAME BACK AS IN DAYLIGHT
CAN I HELP HOW COULD YOU I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS BY LISTENING I HAVEN'T DONE THAT TONIGHT BUT NORMALLY CAN'T I BE THE CONFIDANT OF THE OLD FRENCH PLAYS THE TIRING MAID WITH THE MIRROR AND THE LOYAL EARS
I FOUND MY EYES WERE GROWING ACCUSTOMED TO THE DARKNESS
MISSUS MC GANUM AND I HAVEN'T ANY PARTICULAR CRUSH ON EACH OTHER SHE'S SO STOLID BUT HER MOTHER MISSUS WESTLAKE NOBODY COULD BE SWEETER YES I'M SURE SHE'S VERY BLAND
OH WHAT IS THERE TO CONFIDE THE PEOPLE ARE SAVORLESS AND PROUD OF IT AND EVEN IF I LIKED YOU TREMENDOUSLY I COULDN'T TALK TO YOU WITHOUT TWENTY OLD HEXES WATCHING WHISPERING
SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY YOU WHY DO YOU STAY HERE I HAVE THE VILLAGE VIRUS IT SOUNDS DANGEROUS IT IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE CANCER THAT WILL CERTAINLY GET ME AT FIFTY UNLESS I STOP THIS SMOKING
MOST TROUBLES ARE UNNECESSARY WE HAVE NATURE BEATEN WE CAN MAKE HER GROW WHEAT WE CAN KEEP WARM WHEN SHE SENDS BLIZZARDS SO WE RAISE THE DEVIL JUST FOR PLEASURE WARS POLITICS RACE HATREDS LABOR DISPUTES
SHE WONDERED IF SHE OUGHT TO BE OFFENDED BY HIS CARESS THEN SHE WONDERED IF HE LIKED HER HAT THE NEW ORIENTAL TURBAN OF ROSE AND SILVER BROCADE HE DROPPED HER HAND HIS ELBOW BRUSHED HER SHOULDER HE FLITTED OVER TO THE DESK CHAIR HIS THIN BACK STOOPED
DESERVES TO BE DETECTED I AM RELIEVED TO SAY THAT NONE OF THESE THINGS OCCURRED TO ME THE ROAD FROM WINGDAM TO SLUMGULLION KNEW NO OTHER BANDITTI THAN THE REGULARLY LICENSED HOTELKEEPERS
THE ATROCIOUS ALLUSIVENESS OF THE WORDS HAD ITS EFFECT ON CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT
FACING THE ONLY GAS LAMP YAWNED THE CAVERN OF A SECOND HAND FURNITURE DEALER WHERE DEEP IN THE GLOOM OF A SORT OF NARROW AVENUE WINDING THROUGH A BIZARRE FOREST OF WARDROBES WITH AN UNDERGROWTH TANGLE OF TABLE LEGS
I DON'T THINK I MISSED A SINGLE PIECE AS BIG AS A POSTAGE STAMP AT THIS POINT THE TRAINED FACULTIES OF THE CHIEF INSPECTOR CEASED TO HEAR THE VOICE OF THE CONSTABLE HE MOVED TO ONE OF THE WINDOWS FOR BETTER LIGHT
THE TONE OF THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER'S REMARKS HAD BEEN SOUR ENOUGH TO SET ONE'S TEETH ON EDGE AND SINCE BREAKFAST CHIEF INSPECTOR HEAT HAD NOT MANAGED TO GET ANYTHING TO EAT STARTING IMMEDIATELY TO BEGIN HIS INVESTIGATION ON THE SPOT
FAIR SLIGHT SLIGHT ENOUGH LOOK AT THAT FOOT THERE I PICKED UP THE LEGS FIRST
THE FACT OF THE OUTRAGE BEING ATTEMPTED LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER HE HAD ASSURED A HIGH OFFICIAL THAT NO OUTBREAK OF ANARCHIST ACTIVITY WAS TO BE APPREHENDED WAS SUFFICIENTLY ANNOYING IF HE EVER THOUGHT HIMSELF SAFE IN MAKING A STATEMENT IT WAS THEN
SHE TOOK NO PARTICULAR NOTICE OF THE BIG ONE BUT THE OTHER WAS A FAIR SLIGHT CHAP CARRYING A TIN VARNISH CAN IN ONE HAND THE CONSTABLE CEASED KNOW THE WOMAN MUTTERED THE CHIEF INSPECTOR
AN UNHAPPY HOMELESS COUCH ACCOMPANIED BY TWO UNRELATED CHAIRS STOOD IN THE OPEN THE ONLY HUMAN BEING MAKING USE OF THE ALLEY BESIDES THE PROFESSOR COMING STALWART AND ERECT FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION
BUT HAVEN'T YOU MADE YOUR NAME SIMPLY BY NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE ARE AFTER
FUNNY THE OLD WOMAN SHOULD HAVE NOTICED THE VELVET COLLAR DARK BLUE OVERCOAT WITH A VELVET COLLAR SHE HAS TOLD US HE WAS THE CHAP SHE SAW AND NO MISTAKE AND HERE HE IS ALL COMPLETE VELVET COLLAR AND ALL
FOR A MAN OF REAL CONVICTIONS THIS IS A FINE OPPORTUNITY OF SELF SACRIFICE YOU MAY NOT FIND ANOTHER SO FAVOURABLE SO HUMANE THERE ISN'T EVEN A CAT NEAR US
WHAT IF NOTHING COULD MOVE THEM SUCH MOMENTS COME TO ALL MEN
IT HAD THAT QUALITY OF SERIOUSNESS BELONGING TO EVERY FORM OF OPEN SPORT
LONG JOHN EVEN GOT RID OF TWO OUT OF THE SIX OR SEVEN I HAD ALREADY ENGAGED HE SHOWED ME IN A MOMENT THAT THEY WERE JUST THE SORT OF FRESH WATER SWABS WE HAD TO FEAR IN AN ADVENTURE OF IMPORTANCE
HANGING TO THREADS THAT SEEMED NO THICKER THAN A SPIDER'S THOUGH I HAD LIVED BY THE SHORE ALL MY LIFE I SEEMED NEVER TO HAVE BEEN NEAR THE SEA TILL THEN THE SMELL OF TAR AND SALT WAS SOMETHING NEW
LONG JOHN TOLD THE STORY FROM FIRST TO LAST WITH A GREAT DEAL OF SPIRIT AND THE MOST PERFECT TRUTH THAT WAS HOW IT WERE NOW WEREN'T IT HAWKINS HE WOULD SAY NOW AND AGAIN AND I COULD ALWAYS BEAR HIM ENTIRELY OUT
THROUGH STAGE AFTER STAGE FOR WHEN I WAS AWAKENED AT LAST IT WAS BY A PUNCH IN THE RIBS AND I OPENED MY EYES TO FIND THAT WE WERE STANDING STILL BEFORE A LARGE BUILDING IN A CITY STREET
BUT I WILL SAY THIS JOHN SILVER SUITS ME THE MAN'S A PERFECT TRUMP DECLARED THE SQUIRE AND NOW ADDED THE DOCTOR JIM MAY COME ON BOARD WITH US MAY HE NOT
AND HAD ADDED SOME FURNITURE ABOVE ALL A BEAUTIFUL ARMCHAIR FOR MOTHER IN THE BAR HE HAD FOUND HER A BOY AS AN APPRENTICE ALSO SO THAT SHE SHOULD NOT WANT HELP WHILE I WAS GONE
IT WAS LONGER THAN THE SQUIRE IMAGINED ERE WE WERE READY FOR THE SEA AND NONE OF OUR FIRST PLANS NOT EVEN DOCTOR LIVESEY'S OF KEEPING ME BESIDE HIM COULD BE CARRIED OUT AS WE INTENDED
THE ADMIRABLE FELLOW LITERALLY SLAVED IN MY INTEREST AND SO I MAY SAY DID EVERYONE IN BRISTOL AS SOON AS THEY GOT WIND OF THE PORT WE SAILED FOR TREASURE I MEAN REDRUTH SAID I INTERRUPTING THE LETTER
LEANING OVER FROM HIS BOX HE WHISPERED WITH MYSTERIOUS INDIGNATION WHAT WAS THE MATTER NOW WAS IT POSSIBLE TO TREAT A MAN SO HIS ENORMOUS AND UNWASHED COUNTENANCE FLAMED RED
POSTSCRIPT I DID NOT TELL YOU THAT BLANDLY WHO BY THE WAY IS TO SEND A CONSORT AFTER US IF WE DON'T TURN UP BY THE END OF AUGUST HAD FOUND AN ADMIRABLE FELLOW FOR SAILING MASTER A STIFF MAN WHICH I REGRET
SITTING BY THE FIRE IN THE HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM I APPROACHED THAT ISLAND IN MY FANCY FROM EVERY POSSIBLE DIRECTION I EXPLORED EVERY ACRE OF ITS SURFACE
AT THAT I GAVE UP ALL ATTEMPTS AT COMMENTARY AND READ STRAIGHT ON BLANDLY HIMSELF FOUND THE HISPANIOLA AND BY THE MOST ADMIRABLE MANAGEMENT GOT HER FOR THE MEREST TRIFLE
