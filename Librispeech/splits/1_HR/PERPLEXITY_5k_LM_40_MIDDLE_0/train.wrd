IF THE THOUGHT OF THE MORNING'S CONVERSATION AND OF ANGELICA ENTERED HER MIND IT WAS ONLY TO BE SOON DISMISSED WITH FAIR CONSTRUCTION AND CHEERFUL HOPE AND THEN SHE PICTURED TO HERSELF THE SURPRISE THE PLEASURE OF THURSTON
AND BROUGHT WITH HER THE DRAMATIC QUALIFICATION OF HABITUALLY WEARING A WIG IN PRIVATE LIFE THANKS TO THESE VIGOROUS MEASURES THE PLAY WAS AT LAST SUPPLIED WITH REPRESENTATIVES
HE WENT ON INTO THE SET BUT HIS LEGS SEEMED TO WABBLE BENEATH HIM I WAS SURE IT WAS MORE THAN THE WEAKNESS RESULTING FROM HIS EXPERIENCE IN THE FIRE KAUF'S VOICE THROUGH THE MEGAPHONE ECHOED SUDDENLY FROM WALL TO WALL REVERBERATING BENEATH THE ROOF
EDWIN SAID TO HIMSELF
CHAMBERS TO LET CHANCED TO BE A RARE THING INHABITED BY NUMEROUS INDIVIDUALS WHO HOWEVER AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE IN PARIS HAD NO CONNECTION WITH EACH OTHER
AND ALSO A KNOWLEDGE OF THE CORRESPONDENCES BETWEEN DISEASED CONDITIONS OF THE BODILY ORGANS AND THE MATERIAL REMEDIES WHICH CAN AFFORD RELIEF AND FROM THIS IT IS BUT A STEP FURTHER TO THOSE NUMEROUS INSTANCES
GOOD MORNING LITTLE BO PEEP AND LOOKING UP THE GIRL SAW A WOMAN STANDING NEAR HER AND LEANING UPON A SHORT STICK SHE WAS BENT NEARLY DOUBLE BY WEIGHT OF MANY YEARS HER HAIR WAS WHITE AS SNOW AND HER EYES AS BLACK AS COALS
AND THE LOCOMOTIVE WITHOUT CARS UNDERSTOOD WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW THE LOCOMOTIVE HAD BECOME SEPARATED FROM THE TRAIN BUT HE DID NOT DOUBT THAT THE TRAIN LEFT BEHIND WAS IN DISTRESS
THERE WAS A PAUSE THEN TRIGGER ASKED HOW DID YOU GET INVOLVED IN THIS PERSONALLY MORE OR LESS BY ACCIDENT THE COMMISSIONER SAID IT WAS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SECOND LEAD THAT'S ME HUH SHE SAID UNHAPPILY YES
WHEN SHE LAY HERE BLESSED HIM NOT ONCE BUT A THOUSAND TIMES ANOTHER SILENCE FOLLOWED THIS AND ANOTHER GENTLE BEATING ON MY HAND IT WAS PRETTY FAR IN THE NIGHT SAID PEGGOTTY WHEN SHE ASKED ME FOR SOME DRINK

THE SINGLE ELECTRIC LAMP WHICH LIGHTED THE WINDOWLESS CHAMBER STRUCK A DULL MURKY YELLOW LIGHT FROM THE VAST PILES OF PRECIOUS METAL AND GLEAMED RUDDILY UPON THE GOLDEN FLOOR THIS IS MY TREASURE HOUSE REMARKED THE OWNER
THESE HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN DISCUSSING CHANCE AND RISK BUT THE PHENOMENON KNOWN GENERALLY AS AN INDUSTRIAL CRISIS IS OF WIDER EXTENT
SO RECEEVIN TRANSPORTASHEN AND SUFFISHENT MONEY FROM THE SECRET SERVICE FUND FOR EXPENSES I DEPARTED FOR CLEVELAND AND AFTER A TEJUS TRIP THRO AN ABLISHN COUNTRY I ARRIVED THERE MY THOTS WERE GLOOMY BEYOND EXPRESSION
IT IS ALSO CALLED BY PREEMINENCE THE SACRAMENT AS THE RATIFYING OF A SOLEMN VOW OF CONSECRATION TO CHRIST
AND AS I HAVE SAID WHAT WITH VILLAS GREAT WORSTED FACTORIES ROWS OF WORKMEN'S HOUSES WITH HERE AND THERE AN OLD FASHIONED FARMHOUSE AND OUT BUILDINGS IT CAN HARDLY BE CALLED COUNTRY
WHEN MEN WERE STOUT AND WOMEN SIMPLE I LIKE A GOOD SWAGGERING STORY BEFORE ALL THINGS CURIOUS TIMES THEY WERE WITH THEIR SMUTTY RAILWAYS AND PUFFING OLD IRON TRAINS THEIR RUM LITTLE HOUSES AND THEIR HORSE VEHICLES I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T READ BOOKS
LOOK AT THE BROKEN SCULL LOOK AT THE T'OTHER SCULL GONE NOW TELL ME I AM A LIAR SAID THE HONEST MAN MISTER INSPECTOR STEPPED INTO THE BOAT EUGENE AND MORTIMER LOOKED ON AND SEE NOW
I HAVE TRAVELLED MUCH I HAVE DEEPLY STUDIED MEN INDIVIDUALLY AND IN A BODY BUT I HAVE NEVER MET WITH TRUE SOCIABILITY EXCEPT IN FRENCHMEN THEY ALONE KNOW HOW TO JEST AND IT IS RARE DELICATE
I NEED NOT REMIND THE READER THAT FROM THE LONG AND WEIRD CATALOGUE OF HUMAN MISERIES I MIGHT HAVE SELECTED MANY INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES MORE REPLETE WITH ESSENTIAL SUFFERING THAN ANY OF THESE VAST GENERALITIES OF DISASTER THE TRUE WRETCHEDNESS INDEED THE ULTIMATE WOE
THIS FACT IS BUT AN INDICATION THAT THE FRENCH ARE A RACE OF SAVERS A SILENT REVOLUTION IN THE HABITS OF THE PEASANT PEOPLE HAS BEEN THE OUTCOME OF THE WAR AGES AGO AN UPRISING TOOK THE LAND AWAY FROM WEALTHY OWNERS AND GAVE IT TO THE PEASANTS
LIKE PARIS AND RIO JANEIRO SOME FOR THEIR CULTURE AND LEARNING AS BOSTON AND OXFORD SOME FOR THEIR MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIAL SUPREMACY AS DETROIT AND LIVERPOOL
BUT THEY WERE BY NO MEANS SO RESPECTFUL TO THE OTHER BOYS WHOM THEY LOOKED UPON AS JUST ORDINARY BRAVES THEY SAID HOW DO TO THEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND WHAT ANNOYED THE BOYS WAS THAT PETER SEEMED TO THINK THIS ALL RIGHT
THIS TOOK PLACE IN THE DEPTHS OF A FOREST AT NIGHT IN WINTER FAR FROM ALL HUMAN SIGHT SHE WAS A CHILD OF EIGHT
ELSE YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE SUCH INCONVENIENT ENGAGEMENTS WHY WE ARE TO EAT A PEACOCK AND ORTOLANS UNDER THE LOGGIA AMONG BERNARDO RUCELLAI'S RARE TREES THERE ARE TO BE THE CHOICEST SPIRITS IN FLORENCE AND THE CHOICEST WINES
THERE MUST BE JUST THAT FORCE OR LIVELINESS WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE ALWAYS ABSENT FROM IMAGES THE CASES OF DREAMS
I MUST OWN THAT I HAD NO PARTICULAR WISH TO CRUISE FOR SOME MONTHS IN THIS VESSEL AND GO BACK FOR WATER AT TRISTAN D'ACUNHA
THE FIRST CHIRPING ALMOST SINGING OF A BIRD TO DAY THEN I NOTICED A COUPLE OF HONEY BEES SPIRTING AND HUMMING ABOUT THE OPEN WINDOW IN THE SUN FEBRUARY ELEVEN IN THE SOFT ROSE AND PALE GOLD OF THE DECLINING LIGHT
THIS WILL BE A GREAT THING FOR YOU AND ESPECIALLY FOR HENRY MY DEAR NIECE AS SIR SAMPSON AND LADY MACLAUGHLAN ARE GOING TO LONDON DIRECTLY TO TAKE HIS SEAT IN PARLIAMENT AND SHE WILL MAKE A POINT OF PAYING YOU EVERY ATTENTION AND WILL MATRONISE YOU TO THE PLAY
RECOGNIZED HER PRESENT AND COULD NOT AT FIRST COMPREHEND THIS RESTITUTION BUT THE VISIT OF PORTHOS SOON ENLIGHTENED HER THE ANGER WHICH FIRED THE EYES OF THE MUSKETEER IN SPITE OF HIS EFFORTS TO SUPPRESS IT
AND SHE WAS WELL ABLE TO MAKE VARIOUS OBSERVATIONS AND PROFIT BY THEIR LESSONS NOR WAS SHE DEFICIENT IN MEMORY AS SHE DISTINCTLY SHOWED EVERY SPRING WHEN GOING TO SPAWN
AS ON THESE OCCASIONS THE ACCUSER IS NOT CONFRONTED WITH THE ACCUSED A MAN MAY FALSELY IMPEACH HIS ENEMY AND ACCOMPLISH AN UNJUST REVENGE WITHOUT FEAR OF PUNISHMENT OR DETECTION
UNTIL SUCH TIME AS HE SHOULD SECURE A POSITION DURING THE DAY HE SUCCEEDED IN LOCATING THIS OPERATOR BUT FOUND THAT HE ALSO WAS OUT OF A JOB
THAT WOULD MAKE A FIGURE IN A LETTER ONE OR TWO STIFF GALES AND THE SPRINGING OF A LEAK ARE ACCIDENTS WHICH EXPERIENCED NAVIGATORS SCARCELY REMEMBER TO RECORD AND I SHALL BE WELL CONTENT IF NOTHING WORSE HAPPEN TO US DURING OUR VOYAGE ADIEU MY DEAR MARGARET
WHO THEN CALLED TOGETHER THE PRINCES OF THEIR TRIBES AND THEIR CHIEF MEN
BUT THE CLAVICHORD THIS INSTRUMENT WAS SOUNDED BY STRIKING THE STRINGS WITH BITS OF BRASS PLACED IN THE FARTHER END OF THE KEYS
I AM CHIEF CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH OF ROME WE ARE AND HAVE BEEN THESE TEN YEARS CONNECTED WITH THE HOUSE OF MORREL AND SON OF MARSEILLES WE HAVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS OR THEREABOUTS LOANED ON THEIR SECURITIES
AND PARTICULARLY ON AN AUTHOR SO FRANKLY AND CURIOUSLY HUMAN AS LAMB IS I DO NOT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD IMPRISON YOURSELF WITH LAMB'S COMPLETE WORKS FOR THREE MONTHS AND READ NOTHING ELSE
SHE QUITTED THE PLACE AND IN HER CERTAINTY PASSED THROUGH DARK CORRIDORS AND DOWN A FLIGHT OF OAKEN STEPS THAT SHONE IN THE VAGUE LIGHT OF A HALL WINDOW OUTSIDE RALPH'S DOOR SHE STOPPED A MOMENT LISTENING
AS THOUGH TO SPRING AGAIN SNARLING HORRIBLY AND MAKING SHORT HALF CIRCLES WITH LOWERED HEAD AND SMOKE ALL THE WHILE MEOWED PITEOUSLY BY THE WINDOW AS THOUGH TRYING TO DRAW THE ATTACK UPON HIMSELF THEN IT WAS THAT THE RUSH OF THE WHOLE DREADFUL BUSINESS
AND SEES ANYTHING OF INTEREST VERY TRUE HE SAID AND AMID EVILS SUCH AS THESE WILL NOT HE WHO IS ILL GOVERNED IN HIS OWN PERSON THE TYRANNICAL MAN I MEAN WHOM YOU JUST NOW DECIDED TO BE THE MOST MISERABLE OF ALL
BUT I DO SOLEMNLY AFFIRM THAT I RELATE NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH IN THIS ROOM WERE PLACED SEVERAL LARGE IRON KETTLES SO DEEP THAT A PERSON COULD SIT IN THEM
YOU SEE I AM SO ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT OF THE TECHNIQUE I'VE GOT TO SHAKE HANDS WITH YOU MISTER WARE A STOUT MIDDLE AGED CLEAN SHAVEN MAN WITH NARROW BLACK EYES AND PALE CHEEKS DECLARED STEPPING FORWARD
WILL BE ASKING HER TO TELL ME WHETHER SHE RETURNS IT THAT IS WHAT I WANT HER TO TELL YOU SAID FRED BLUNTLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO UNLESS I CAN GET AT HER FEELING YOU MEAN THAT YOU WOULD BE GUIDED BY THAT AS TO YOUR GOING INTO THE CHURCH
I DO NOT THINK THAT ANYONE SHOULD RECEIVE A DIVORCE IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS NOR DO I THINK THAT ANY PERSONAL RIGHT IS CONTRAVENED BY THE IMPOSING OF SUCH A DELAY NEXT
AND WHY SHOULD HE BE BROUGHT TO THEM AND BE LOOKED AT STRANGELY AND SPOKEN OF INAUDIBLY HOWARD APPEARED BENEATH WALKING QUICKLY ACROSS THE POLISHED FLOOR TOWARDS THEM AS HE DREW NEAR HE BOWED AND PERFORMED CERTAIN PECULIAR MOVEMENTS APPARENTLY OF A CEREMONIOUS NATURE
HE HINTED TO BE A SOMEWHAT JAUNDICED SENTIMENTALITY NATURE HE ADDED IN SHAKESPEARE'S WORDS HAD MEAL AND BRAN AND RIGHTLY REGARDED THE BRAN IN ITS WAY WAS NOT TO BE CONDEMNED
THE YOUNG MAN DREW BACK WITH A START BUT IN A MOMENT HE CLIMBED THE TREE CUTTING THE ROPE WHICH HELD THE SWORD AND CARRIED THE WEAPON TO HIS MOTHER THE QUEEN WAS GREATLY SURPRISED AT THE SIGHT OF ANYTHING SO SPLENDID IN SUCH A LONELY PLACE
TO THE MAN SHE LOVED BUT IN THE FACE OF ACTUAL NEED THE COURAGE THAT WAS SO MUCH A PART OF HER NATURE DID NOT FAIL HER HE MADE NO MORE REMONSTRANCES BUT SET ABOUT HIS WORK QUICKLY AND ALL THROUGH THE HORRIBLE TIME THAT FOLLOWED SHE DID NOT FALTER
THE SON WILL GIVE EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM
NOT IN ITSELF BUT THE ANIMAL IS THEREBY SUBJECTED TO CONSTANT CHILLS IN EMERGING FROM A SNOOZY WARMTH TO A COLD CARPET OR CHILLY BED
HIS CHOICE OF A MESSENGER WAS SHREWD THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR WAS OF ALL MEN THE MOST ANXIOUS FOR THE DELIVERANCE OF HIS CITY THE ONE MAN WHO ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT WOULD PLEAD MOST FERVENTLY FOR ITS PRESERVATION AT ALL COSTS
AND ADMITTED OF NEITHER OBJECTION NOR RESTRICTION IN HIS EYES OF COURSE THE ECCLESIASTICAL AUTHORITY WAS THE CHIEF OF ALL HE WAS RELIGIOUS SUPERFICIAL AND CORRECT ON THIS POINT AS ON ALL OTHERS IN HIS EYES A PRIEST WAS A MIND
CLASPING ME ROUND THE LEGS WITH A BEAMING SMILE AND SAYING AND IS MY FATHER GOING TO THE WAR AND WILL HE BRING ME BACK A BEAR WHEN SOME FIVE MONTHS LATER I RETURNED OF COURSE IN MY UNIFORM
HIS ROUND EYES SHINING LIKE A PAIR OF GREEN PHOSPHORESCENT GLOBES HAVING NO WEAPON I WAS AT THE BRUTE'S MERCY AND WAS ABOUT TO UTTER A LOUD SHOUT TO SUMMON ASSISTANCE BUT AS HE SAT SO STILL I REFRAINED
CLARY LET'S AWAY HERE'S THE COACH SAID MISTER SAINT GEORGE WHY MY BOY THAT'S A FAMOUS FELLOW FAITH WHY YOU LOOK THE BETTER FOR BEING DROWNED
WITH A SHUDDER SHE RECALLED THE EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW DAYS HER ESCAPE FROM PARIS WITH HER TWO CHILDREN ALL THREE OF THEM HIDDEN BENEATH THE HOOD OF A RICKETY CART AND LYING AMIDST A HEAP OF TURNIPS AND CABBAGES NOT DARING TO BREATHE WHILST THE MOB HOWLED
AND I DECLARE I NEVER LAID EYES ON A WOMAN THAT I THOUGHT COULD FILL THE PART BETTER JULIA CLOUD WAS QUITE OVERWHELMED BUT THE MATTER OF THE SALARY TROUBLED HER I THINK IT SHOULD NOT BE A MATTER OF MONEY SHE DEMURRED I WOULD RATHER DO IT FOR LOVE YOU KNOW
DURING THIS EARLIER PERIOD THERE IS LITTLE AGGRESSION AND LITTLE PROPENSITY FOR ANTAGONISM THE TRANSITION FROM THIS PEACEABLE TEMPER TO THE PREDACEOUS AND IN EXTREME CASES MALIGNANT MISCHIEVOUSNESS OF THE BOY IS A GRADUAL ONE AND IT IS ACCOMPLISHED WITH MORE COMPLETENESS
OVER AN INTERNAL SCAFFOLDING OF STICKS WITH AN INFINITE NUMBER OF TIES AND CROSS BRACES SO THAT IT MAKES A SORT OF SHAPELESS BALL AND TO ARRANGE THE FLOWERS SO THAT THEY ARE EQUALLY SPOTTED ALL OVER IT BY TYING BACK SOME ALMOST TO SNAPPING POINT
AS IF HE WERE SHOWING IT TO THE INFINITE HIS ARM DISAPPEARED THERE WAS NO GREATER FOLD ON THE DEEP SEA THAN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ON A TUN OF OIL THE SNOW CONTINUED FALLING ONE THING FLOATED
MINE
AS HE LISTENED TO THE BLOWS OF THE CHOPPER WHICH THE BOY WAS USING AND OBSERVED THE QUARTERS OF BEEF THROUGH THE CURTAINS YES MY LAD IT BELONGS TO A FRIEND OF MINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT WHILST THE HORSE JUST RECOVERS HIS WIND
WHO SAW THESE NOBLE FELLOWS FALL DOWN AND DIE AS THEY WALKED ALONG THE ICE LOOKING TO THE FACT THAT LITTLE OR NO FRESH FOOD COULD HAVE BEEN OBTAINED BY THE CREWS OF THE EREBUS AND TERROR DURING THEIR LONG IMPRISONMENT OF TWENTY MONTHS IN SO FRIGHTFULLY STERILE A REGION AS THAT IN WHICH THE SHIPS WERE ABANDONED
THAT EVENING THE TWO MEN SAT AT DINNER IN THE RECTORY IT WAS A VERY FINE RECTORY BEAUTIFULLY FURNISHED FOR OWEN WAS A MAN OF TASTE WHICH HE HAD THE MEANS TO GRATIFY ALSO ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALONE THE DINNER WAS GOOD
SOME PAPERS THEY WILL FIND I DOUBT BUT I MUST TAKE CONSEQUENCES MY BROTHER AND SISTER WILL BE AT HAND WITH THEIR GOOD NATURED CONSTRUCTIONS
AND WENT AWAY BY THE SIDE GATE INTO STREET THEY WHO DO YOU MEAN BY THEY WHY
AND ABOVE ALL VIVIDLY REMEMBERED THE MOMENT AT THE AMBULANCE STATION WHEN AT THE SIGHT OF THE SUFFERINGS OF A MAN HE DISLIKED THOSE NEW THOUGHTS HAD COME TO HIM WHICH PROMISED HIM HAPPINESS AND THOSE
PLIABLE IS HURT WITH OBSTINATE'S COARSE ABUSE OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE TILL HE IS DOWNRIGHT ASHAMED TO BE SEEN IN HIS COMPANY PLIABLE AT LEAST IS A GENTLEMAN COMPARED WITH OBSTINATE AND HIS GENTLEMANLY FEELINGS AND HIS GOOD MANNERS MAKE HIM AT ONCE TAKE SIDES WITH CHRISTIAN
AH WHO IS THE LORD OF THIS CITY SO FINE IT BELONGS TO KING THRUSHBEARD AND IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THINE IF HIS QUEEN YOU HAD BEEN AH SAD MUST I SING I WOULD I'D ACCEPTED THE HEART OF THE KING
RESEMBLED AN OVAL PATCH OF NIGHT SKY FLUNG DOWN INTO THE HOPELESS AND ABYSMAL NIGHT OF THE WILDERNESS THE WHITE MAN HAD SOME SUPPER OUT OF THE BASKET THEN COLLECTING A FEW STICKS THAT LAY ABOUT THE PLATFORM MADE UP A SMALL FIRE

THE LITTLE BOOK OF CRITICISM NEVER APPEARED EIGHTY THE ORCHESTRA IN BERLIN CONTAINS THE GREATEST AGGREGATION OF VIRTUOSI IN THE WORLD
AND CAME TO THE CITY NOB TO AHIMELECH THE PRIEST WHO WHEN HE SAW HIM COMING ALL ALONE AND NEITHER A FRIEND NOR A SERVANT WITH HIM HE WONDERED AT IT AND DESIRED TO LEARN OF HIM THE CAUSE WHY THERE WAS NOBODY WITH HIM TO WHICH DAVID ANSWERED
IT WAS ONE OF THESE HE HAD UNCOVERED AND WHICH HE MUST REMOVE FROM ITS SOCKET DANTES STROVE TO DO THIS WITH HIS NAILS BUT THEY WERE TOO WEAK THE FRAGMENTS OF THE JUG BROKE AND AFTER AN HOUR OF USELESS TOIL HE PAUSED
THESE HAD FORTHWITH MELTED THROUGH UNFORTUNATE VENTURES AND SPECULATIONS TILL HE HAD LITTLE REMAINING TO HIM BUT THE MONEY THAT THIS SAME DIAMOND HAD BROUGHT
TO WHICH THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS IN THESE LAST CENTURIES BEEN INDEBTED FOR HER MAINTENANCE AND EXTENSION THERE WAS ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE STILL
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD WEATHERING HE SMILED FAINTLY OF COURSE THE CHURCH ITSELF IS CENTURIES OLDER DRENCHED WITH AGE BUT SHE'S STILL SLEEP WALKING WHILE THESE OLD TOMBSTONES DREAM GLOW WORMS AND CRICKETS ARE NOT SUCH BAD BEDFELLOWS
DO YOU THINK HE'LL EVER TELL YOU WHO ALICE IS I ASKED I HAVE A NOTION WHO ALICE IS ALREADY SAID THE MYSTERIOUS CREATURE BUT SHE WOULD TELL US NOTHING MORE WHEN THE JELLY COOKIES WERE ALL EATEN IT WAS HIGH TIME TO BE MOVING HOMEWARD

AND THE PROUD HEAD FLASHED UP I CAN THROW MY CAP AT WHO I LIKE BECAUSE IT'S LEAP YEAR
THE OLD FASHIONED POINTER WAS VOTED A NUISANCE THROUGH HIS EXTREME CAUTION AND TORTOISE LIKE MOVEMENTS THERE IS EVIDENCE THROUGH PORTRAITS THAT POINTERS HAD BEEN ALTOGETHER CHANGED BY THE YEAR EIGHTEEN HUNDRED
EVERY ONE THEY SAW EITHER IN THE HOUSE OR OUT IN THE STREETS APPEARED HURRYING TO SOME APPOINTMENT EXPECTED BY OR EXPECTING SOMEBODY THEY ALONE SEEMED STRANGE AND FRIENDLESS AND DESOLATE
NOW THAT IT WAS TOO LATE TO UTTER THEM THE DEEP IMPRESSION MADE BY THE INTERVIEW WAS LIKE THAT OF A HORROR IN A DREAM THAT WILL NOT LEAVE THE ROOM ALTHOUGH WE WAKEN UP AND RUB OUR EYES AND FORCE A STIFF RIGID SMILE UPON OUR LIPS
NONE OF THE WEEDS CARPETING THE SEAFLOOR NONE OF THE BRANCHES BRISTLING FROM THE SHRUBBERY CREPT OR LEANED OR STRETCHED ON A HORIZONTAL PLANE THEY ALL ROSE RIGHT UP TOWARD THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
AND CONCEIVED IN THE SPIRIT OF THE AUTHOR OF THE SCARLET LETTER THE COMBINATION IS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT THE POEM AS A PIECE OF FICTION HAS MANY ELEMENTS OF INTEREST
AND TURNING SHE SAW BEFORE HER A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN WHO ASKED WHY SHE HAD COME TO STEAL HIS FIREWOOD THE GIRL WHO FELT MUCH CONFUSED ONLY MANAGED TO STAMMER OUT AS AN EXCUSE THAT HER FATHER HAD SENT HER
