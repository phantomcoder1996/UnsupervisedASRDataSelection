HE MIGHT THERE BE IMPORTANT AT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EXPENSE TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH OVER LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT ITS MORE CONVENIENT DISTANCE FROM KELLYNCH ONLY FIFTY MILES AND LADY RUSSELL'S SPENDING SOME PART OF EVERY WINTER THERE
TRUE SAID ANNE VERY TRUE I DID NOT RECOLLECT BUT WHAT SHALL WE SAY NOW CAPTAIN HARVILLE IF THE CHANGE BE NOT FROM OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCES
A SOMETHING BETWEEN DELIGHT AND MISERY HE SPOKE TO HER AND THEN TURNED AWAY THE CHARACTER OF HIS MANNER WAS EMBARRASSMENT SHE COULD NOT HAVE CALLED IT EITHER COLD OR FRIENDLY OR ANYTHING SO CERTAINLY AS EMBARRASSED
IT WAS A MUCH SAFER PLACE FOR A GENTLEMAN IN HIS PREDICAMENT HE MIGHT THERE BE IMPORTANT AT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE EXPENSE TWO MATERIAL ADVANTAGES OF BATH OVER LONDON HAD OF COURSE BEEN GIVEN ALL THEIR WEIGHT
BUT I CAN DISTINGUISH THE TONES OF THAT VOICE WHEN THEY WOULD BE LOST ON OTHERS TOO GOOD TOO EXCELLENT CREATURE YOU DO US JUSTICE INDEED YOU DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS TRUE ATTACHMENT AND CONSTANCY AMONG MEN
SHE HAD A CULTIVATED MIND AND WAS GENERALLY SPEAKING RATIONAL AND CONSISTENT BUT SHE HAD PREJUDICES ON THE SIDE OF ANCESTRY SHE HAD A VALUE FOR RANK AND CONSEQUENCE WHICH BLINDED HER A LITTLE TO THE FAULTS OF THOSE WHO POSSESSED THEM
AS IF HEAVEN HAD GIVEN THEM WINGS BY MANY HOURS SOONER STILL IF I COULD EXPLAIN TO YOU ALL THIS AND ALL THAT A MAN CAN BEAR AND DO AND GLORIES TO DO FOR THE SAKE OF THESE TREASURES OF HIS EXISTENCE I SPEAK YOU KNOW
OR HE WAS TOO SHY AND AFTER GIVING HIM A WEEK'S INDULGENCE LADY RUSSELL DETERMINED HIM TO BE UNWORTHY OF THE INTEREST WHICH HE HAD BEEN BEGINNING TO EXCITE THE MUSGROVES CAME BACK TO RECEIVE THEIR HAPPY BOYS AND GIRLS FROM SCHOOL
SHE HAD NEVER RECEIVED FROM HER MORE THAN OUTWARD ATTENTION NOTHING BEYOND THE OBSERVANCES OF COMPLAISANCE HAD NEVER SUCCEEDED IN ANY POINT WHICH SHE WANTED TO CARRY AGAINST PREVIOUS INCLINATION SHE HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY VERY EARNEST IN TRYING TO GET ANNE INCLUDED IN THE VISIT TO LONDON
THAT THEY SHOULD LOSE NEITHER CONSEQUENCE NOR ENJOYMENT BY SETTLING THERE LADY RUSSELL FELT OBLIGED TO OPPOSE HER DEAR ANNE'S KNOWN WISHES
HE LOOKED VERY WELL NOT AS IF HE HAD BEEN SUFFERING IN HEALTH OR SPIRITS AND HE TALKED OF UPPERCROSS OF THE MUSGROVES NAY EVEN OF LOUISA AND HAD EVEN A MOMENTARY LOOK OF HIS OWN ARCH SIGNIFICANCE AS HE NAMED HER BUT YET IT WAS CAPTAIN WENTWORTH NOT COMFORTABLE
AS BEING THE HANDSOMEST AND BEST HUNG OF ANY IN BATH BUT COULD NOT RECOLLECT THE EXACT NUMBER AND I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHICH IT COULD BE BUT I CONFESS I CAN SEE NO CURTAINS HEREABOUTS THAT ANSWER THEIR DESCRIPTION ANNE SIGHED
SHE HAD BEEN REPEATEDLY VERY EARNEST IN TRYING TO GET ANNE INCLUDED IN THE VISIT TO LONDON SENSIBLY OPEN TO ALL THE INJUSTICE
WHEN ANNE COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT UPPERCROSS WAS ALREADY QUITE ALIVE AGAIN THOUGH NEITHER HENRIETTA NOR LOUISA NOR CHARLES HAYTER NOR CAPTAIN WENTWORTH WERE THERE
AND NOW IF SHE WERE BY ANY CHANCE TO BE THROWN INTO COMPANY WITH CAPTAIN WENTWORTH HER IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE OF THE MATTER MIGHT ADD ANOTHER SHADE OF PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM THE FOLLOWING MORNING ANNE WAS OUT WITH HER FRIEND AND FOR THE FIRST HOUR IN AN INCESSANT AND FEARFUL SORT OF WATCH FOR HIM IN VAIN
WOULD HAVE DEEMED SUCH A DOMESTIC HURRICANE A BAD RESTORATIVE OF THE NERVES WHICH LOUISA'S ILLNESS MUST HAVE SO GREATLY SHAKEN BUT MISSUS MUSGROVE WHO GOT ANNE NEAR HER ON PURPOSE TO THANK HER MOST CORDIALLY AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR ALL HER ATTENTIONS TO THEM
EVERY EMENDATION OF ANNE'S HAD BEEN ON THE SIDE OF HONESTY AGAINST IMPORTANCE SHE WANTED MORE VIGOROUS MEASURES A MORE COMPLETE REFORMATION A QUICKER RELEASE FROM DEBT A MUCH HIGHER TONE OF INDIFFERENCE FOR EVERYTHING BUT JUSTICE AND EQUITY
HE UNDRESSED AND PLUNGED IN INSIDE THE COVE THE WATER WAS UNINTERESTING TO A SWIMMER BEING SMOOTH AS A POND AND TO GET A LITTLE OF THE OCEAN SWELL
AS IF YOU WERE HEDGING SO THREE AS IF YOU WERE REAPING SO FOUR AS IF YOU WERE THRESHING IN THAT WAY THEN THE SAME ON THE LEFT THE THRUSTS ARE THESE ONE TWO THREE FOUR RIGHT
SHE SAW THE POINT GLISTEN TOWARDS HER BOSOM AND SEEMINGLY ENTER IT BATHSHEBA CLOSED HER EYES IN THE FULL PERSUASION THAT SHE WAS KILLED AT LAST HOWEVER FEELING JUST AS USUAL SHE OPENED THEM AGAIN
AS USUAL WITH DECIDED CHARACTERS BATHSHEBA INVARIABLY PROVOKED THE CRITICISM OF INDIVIDUALS LIKE HENERY FRAY HER EMBLAZONED FAULT WAS TO BE TOO PRONOUNCED IN HER OBJECTIONS AND NOT SUFFICIENTLY OVERT IN HER LIKINGS
AMONG THE FERNS WITH BATHSHEBA IT MAY SAFELY BE ASSERTED WITH RESPECT TO THE CLOSENESS OF HIS CUTS THAT HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE FOR THE EDGE OF THE SWORD TO LEAVE IN THE AIR A PERMANENT SUBSTANCE WHEREVER IT FLEW PAST
THE DOG CAME UP LICKED HIS HAND AND MADE SIGNS IMPLYING THAT HE EXPECTED SOME GREAT REWARD FOR SIGNAL SERVICES RENDERED OAK LOOKED OVER THE PRECIPICE
OAK RAISED HIS HEAD AND WONDERING WHAT HE COULD DO LISTLESSLY SURVEYED THE SCENE BY THE OUTER MARGIN OF THE PIT WAS AN OVAL POND AND OVER IT HUNG THE ATTENUATED SKELETON OF A CHROME YELLOW MOON WHICH HAD ONLY A FEW DAYS TO LAST
THROWS THE LOOSE LOCKS INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FLEECE ROLLS IT UP AND CARRIES IT INTO THE BACKGROUND AS THREE AND A HALF POUNDS OF UNADULTERATED WARMTH FOR THE WINTER ENJOYMENT OF PERSONS UNKNOWN AND FAR AWAY WHO WILL HOWEVER NEVER EXPERIENCE THE SUPERLATIVE COMFORT DERIVABLE
BUT SOME THOUGHTFUL PERSONS WHO HAD SEEN HIM WALKING ACROSS ONE OF HIS FIELDS ON A CERTAIN DECEMBER MORNING SUNNY AND EXCEEDINGLY MILD MIGHT HAVE REGARDED GABRIEL OAK IN OTHER ASPECTS THAN THESE
WHAT THEY CONVERSED ABOUT WAS NOT AUDIBLE TO GABRIEL WHO WAS TOO INDEPENDENT TO GET NEAR THOUGH TOO CONCERNED TO DISREGARD THE ISSUE OF THEIR DIALOGUE WAS THE TAKING OF HER HAND BY THE COURTEOUS FARMER TO HELP HER OVER THE SPREADING BOARD INTO THE BRIGHT JUNE SUNLIGHT OUTSIDE
THE THIRD ITEM OF CONSCIOUSNESS WAS THAT OF SEEING THE SAME SWORD PERFECTLY CLEAN AND FREE FROM BLOOD HELD VERTICALLY IN TROY'S HAND IN THE POSITION TECHNICALLY CALLED RECOVER SWORDS ALL WAS AS QUICK AS ELECTRICITY
HE HAD JUST REACHED THE TIME OF LIFE AT WHICH YOUNG IS CEASING TO BE THE PREFIX OF MAN IN SPEAKING OF ONE HE WAS AT THE BRIGHTEST PERIOD OF MASCULINE GROWTH FOR HIS INTELLECT AND HIS EMOTIONS WERE CLEARLY SEPARATED
IT WAS A FINE MORNING AND THE SUN LIGHTED UP TO A SCARLET GLOW THE CRIMSON JACKET SHE WORE AND PAINTED A SOFT LUSTRE UPON HER BRIGHT FACE AND DARK HAIR THE MYRTLES GERANIUMS AND CACTUSES PACKED AROUND HER WERE FRESH AND GREEN
HE DID IT SO THOROUGHLY THAT HE WOULD HAVE CHASED THEM ACROSS THE WHOLE COUNTY WITH THE GREATEST PLEASURE IF NOT CALLED OFF OR REMINDED WHEN TO STOP BY THE EXAMPLE OF OLD GEORGE THUS MUCH FOR THE DOGS ON THE FURTHER SIDE OF NORCOMBE HILL WAS A CHALK PIT
WILL YOU STAY ON WITH ME SHE SAID SMILING WINNINGLY AND NOT TROUBLING TO BRING HER LIPS QUITE TOGETHER AGAIN AT THE END BECAUSE THERE WAS GOING TO BE ANOTHER SMILE SOON
I WOULDN'T CRY ABOUT IT MISS SAID WILLIAM SMALLBURY COMPASSIONATELY WHY NOT ASK HIM SOFTER LIKE I'M SURE HE'D COME THEN GABLE IS A TRUE MAN IN THAT WAY BATHSHEBA CHECKED HER GRIEF AND WIPED HER EYES
HE CROSSED OVER TOWARDS BATHSHEBA WHO TURNED TO GREET HIM WITH A CARRIAGE OF PERFECT EASE HE SPOKE TO HER IN LOW TONES AND SHE INSTINCTIVELY MODULATED HER OWN TO THE SAME PITCH AND HER VOICE ULTIMATELY EVEN CAUGHT THE INFLECTION OF HIS
EITHER OF DISTINCTION OR NOTORIETY THE RED JACKETED AND DARK HAIRED MAIDEN SEEMED TO THINK SO TOO FOR SHE CARELESSLY GLANCED OVER HIM AND TOLD HER MAN TO DRIVE ON
YOU HAVE YOUR HANDS ON THOUSANDS YOU FOOLS AND YOU HANG A LEG YOU'D BE AS RICH AS KINGS IF YOU COULD FIND IT AND YOU KNOW IT'S HERE AND YOU STAND THERE SKULKING THERE WASN'T ONE OF YOU DARED FACE BILL
WORTH PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED GUINEAS TO HELP HIM ON HIS FURTHER WANDERINGS I THINK WE WERE ALL PLEASED TO BE SO CHEAPLY QUIT OF HIM
BEN IN HIS LONG LONELY WANDERINGS ABOUT THE ISLAND HAD FOUND THE SKELETON IT WAS HE THAT HAD RIFLED IT HE HAD FOUND THE TREASURE HE HAD DUG IT UP IT WAS THE HAFT OF HIS PICK AXE THAT LAY BROKEN IN THE EXCAVATION
BOUT SHIP MATES THIS HERE CREW IS ON A WRONG TACK I DO BELIEVE AND COME TO THINK ON IT IT WAS LIKE FLINT'S VOICE I GRANT YOU BUT
AND STRAGGLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO THE BEACH WHERE THE TWO GIGS AWAITED US EVEN THESE BORE TRACE OF THE DRUNKEN FOLLY OF THE PIRATES ONE IN A BROKEN THWART AND BOTH IN THEIR MUDDY AND UNBAILED CONDITION
WHO COULD BE TRUSTED AT A PINCH WITH ALMOST ANYTHING HE WAS A GREAT CONFIDANT OF LONG JOHN SILVER AND SO THE MENTION OF HIS NAME
CHILLED ME THROUGH MY JACKET THE HISPANIOLA STILL LAY WHERE SHE HAD ANCHORED BUT SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS THE JOLLY ROGER THE BLACK FLAG OF PIRACY FLYING FROM HER PEAK EVEN AS I LOOKED THERE CAME ANOTHER RED FLASH
IF I DIE LIKE A DOG I'LL DIE IN MY DOOTY YOU'VE KILLED ALAN HAVE YOU KILL ME TOO IF YOU CAN BUT I DEFIES YOU AND WITH THAT THIS BRAVE FELLOW TURNED HIS BACK DIRECTLY ON THE COOK AND SET OFF WALKING FOR THE BEACH
SHOT FAR AHEAD OF HER CONSORT AND THE BOW HAD STRUCK AMONG THE SHORE SIDE TREES AND I HAD CAUGHT A BRANCH AND SWUNG MYSELF OUT AND PLUNGED INTO THE NEAREST THICKET WHILE SILVER AND THE REST WERE STILL A HUNDRED YARDS BEHIND
AND THOUGH NOTHING HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TAKEN AWAY EXCEPT THE CAPTAIN'S MONEY BAG AND A LITTLE SILVER FROM THE TILL I COULD SEE AT ONCE THAT WE WERE RUINED MISTER DANCE COULD MAKE NOTHING OF THE SCENE THEY GOT THE MONEY YOU SAY
AND A FEW BEING GOOD FELLOWS IN THE MAIN COULD NEITHER BE LED NOR DRIVEN ANY FURTHER IT IS ONE THING TO BE IDLE AND SKULK AND QUITE ANOTHER TO TAKE A SHIP AND MURDER A NUMBER OF INNOCENT MEN AT LAST HOWEVER THE PARTY WAS MADE UP
SEE HERE NOW HAWKINS SAID HE HERE'S A BLESSED HARD THING ON A MAN LIKE ME NOW AIN'T IT THERE'S CAP'N TRELAWNEY WHAT'S HE TO THINK HERE I HAVE THIS CONFOUNDED SON OF A DUTCHMAN SITTING IN MY OWN HOUSE DRINKING OF MY OWN RUM
FOR AFTER A DAY OR TWO AT SEA HE BEGAN TO APPEAR ON DECK WITH HAZY EYE RED CHEEKS STUTTERING TONGUE AND OTHER MARKS OF DRUNKENNESS
AND WHAT A MEAL IT WAS WITH BEN GUNN'S SALTED GOAT AND SOME DELICACIES AND A BOTTLE OF OLD WINE FROM THE HISPANIOLA NEVER I AM SURE WERE PEOPLE GAYER OR HAPPIER
ONLY NOW AND AGAIN INTERRUPTED BY THE OTHER BY THE SOUND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TALKING EARNESTLY AND ALMOST FIERCELY BUT NO DISTINCT WORD CAME TO MY HEARING AT LAST THE SPEAKERS SEEMED TO HAVE PAUSED AND PERHAPS TO HAVE SAT DOWN
WE STARTED CERTAINLY BUT IN SPITE OF THE HOT SUN AND THE STARING DAYLIGHT THE PIRATES NO LONGER RAN SEPARATE AND SHOUTING THROUGH THE WOOD
TO ME HE WAS UNWEARIEDLY KIND AND ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE ME IN THE GALLEY WHICH HE KEPT AS CLEAN AS A NEW PIN THE DISHES HANGING UP BURNISHED AND HIS PARROT IN A CAGE IN ONE CORNER
JUST TAKE A BEARING WILL YOU ALONG THE LINE OF THEM BONES IT WAS DONE THE BODY POINTED STRAIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ISLAND AND THE COMPASS READ DULY E S
BEGAN TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS APPEARANCE THERE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED HE HAD LITTLE RIGHT TO EXPECT A WELCOME AT FULLERTON AND STATING HIS IMPATIENCE TO BE ASSURED OF MISS MORLAND'S HAVING REACHED HER HOME IN SAFETY
WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR FIFTEEN SONNETS IN CELEBRATION OF HER CHARMS AND WENT TO HER CHAIR IN GOOD HUMOUR WITH EVERYBODY
I HAVE BEEN SAYING HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF THE SKINNERS WERE HERE THIS WINTER INSTEAD OF LAST OR IF THE PARRYS HAD COME AS THEY TALKED OF ONCE SHE MIGHT HAVE DANCED WITH GEORGE PARRY I AM SO SORRY SHE HAS NOT HAD A PARTNER
HE APPROACHED IMMEDIATELY AND TOOK THE SEAT TO WHICH HER MOVEMENTS INVITED HIM HIS FIRST ADDRESS MADE CATHERINE START THOUGH SPOKEN LOW SHE COULD DISTINGUISH WHAT
AND ALL OUR AGREEABLENESS BELONGS SOLELY TO EACH OTHER FOR THAT TIME NOBODY CAN FASTEN THEMSELVES ON THE NOTICE OF ONE WITHOUT INJURING THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER I CONSIDER A COUNTRY DANCE AS AN EMBLEM OF MARRIAGE
NEATNESS AND FASHION ARE ENOUGH FOR THE FORMER AND A SOMETHING OF SHABBINESS OR IMPROPRIETY WILL BE MOST ENDEARING TO THE LATTER BUT NOT ONE OF THESE GRAVE REFLECTIONS TROUBLED THE TRANQUILLITY OF CATHERINE
IF I CAN BUT BE NEAR YOU I SHALL BE SATISFIED BUT THIS IS IDLE TALKING I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO THINK OF SUCH THINGS TILL WE HAVE YOUR FATHER'S ANSWER MORLAND SAYS THAT BY SENDING IT TONIGHT TO SALISBURY WE MAY HAVE IT TOMORROW TOMORROW
TILL THEY WERE HAPPILY SEATED AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN THE GENERAL'S COMPLACENT SMILES AND A GOOD APPETITE OF HER OWN RESTORED HER TO PEACE THE DINING PARLOUR WAS A NOBLE ROOM
WAS REPEATED BY THEM ALL TWO OR THREE TIMES OVER FOR A MOMENT CATHERINE WAS SURPRISED BUT MISSUS THORPE AND HER DAUGHTERS HAD SCARCELY BEGUN THE HISTORY OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER JAMES MORLAND
HE NEVER COMES TO THE PUMP ROOM I SUPPOSE YES SOMETIMES BUT HE HAS RID OUT THIS MORNING WITH MY FATHER MISSUS HUGHES NOW JOINED THEM AND ASKED MISS TILNEY IF SHE WAS READY TO GO
THE ENGAGEMENTS OF HIS CURATE AT WOODSTON OBLIGING HIM TO LEAVE THEM ON SATURDAY
ENCOURAGED HIS HORSE MADE ODD NOISES AND DROVE ON AND CATHERINE ANGRY AND VEXED AS SHE WAS HAVING NO POWER OF GETTING AWAY WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE UP THE POINT AND SUBMIT HER REPROACHES HOWEVER WERE NOT SPARED
HER ONLY DEPENDENCE FOR INFORMATION OF ANY KIND WAS ON ISABELLA JAMES HAD PROTESTED AGAINST WRITING TO HER TILL HIS RETURN TO OXFORD AND MISSUS ALLEN HAD GIVEN HER NO HOPES OF A LETTER TILL SHE HAD GOT BACK TO FULLERTON
BY ITS FALLING SHORT OF HIS PLAN HOW WERE MISTER ALLEN'S SUCCESSION HOUSES WORKED DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HIS OWN AS THEY ENTERED THEM MISTER ALLEN HAD ONLY ONE SMALL HOT HOUSE WHICH MISSUS ALLEN HAD THE USE OF FOR HER PLANTS IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN IT NOW AND THEN
AND COULD WE CARRY OUR SELFISH POINT WITH YOU WE SHOULD LEAVE IT WITHOUT A SINGLE REGRET CAN YOU IN SHORT BE PREVAILED ON TO QUIT THIS SCENE OF PUBLIC TRIUMPH AND OBLIGE YOUR FRIEND ELEANOR WITH YOUR COMPANY IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE
HE WAS WITH US JUST NOW AND SAID HE WAS SO TIRED OF LOUNGING ABOUT THAT HE WAS RESOLVED TO GO AND DANCE SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS HE WOULD ASK YOU IF HE MET WITH YOU
AND CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY TOOK HER USUAL PLACE BY THE SIDE OF HER FRIEND JAMES WHO WAS NOW IN CONSTANT ATTENDANCE MAINTAINED A SIMILAR POSITION AND SEPARATING THEMSELVES FROM THE REST OF THEIR PARTY THEY WALKED IN THAT MANNER FOR SOME TIME
MISS TILNEY CONTINUING SILENT SHE VENTURED TO SAY HER DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT AFFLICTION A GREAT AND INCREASING ONE REPLIED THE OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
THE PRISON OF MARY STUART OR THE CHATEAU OF HOUGOMONT AFTER PASSING ROUND AND AGAIN REACHING THE GATE HE WENT IN
AS A MOTH FRETS A GARMENT ENTIRELY ENGROSSED WITH ITS PRODUCTS HAVING NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING IN THE WORLD BUT FERN FURZE HEATH LICHENS AND MOSS
RISING UPWARDS AND DANCING ABOUT LIKE SPARKS OF FIRE O
NOW HEARKEN TO ME SHE SAID HER DELICATE VOICE EXPANDING INTO FIRMNESS BY A FORCE WHICH WAS OTHER THAN PHYSICAL TELL HIM NOTHING
SAID HER AUNT WHO STOOD AT THE EDGE OF THE PIT
AND NOT THAT OF A PERSON COME ON BUSINESS OR BY INVITATION HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE WITH INTEREST AND THEN WALKED ROUND AND SCANNED THE OUTER BOUNDARY OF THE GARDEN AS ONE MIGHT HAVE DONE HAD IT BEEN THE BIRTHPLACE OF SHAKESPEARE
THAT IS THOSE WHO HAVE HAD NO PRELIMINARY TRAINING MY PLAN IS ONE FOR INSTILLING HIGH KNOWLEDGE INTO EMPTY MINDS WITHOUT FIRST CRAMMING THEM WITH WHAT HAS TO BE UNCRAMMED AGAIN BEFORE TRUE STUDY BEGINS
BUT THE PRESENT TORRID ATTACK MADE THE JOURNEY A HEAVY UNDERTAKING FOR A WOMAN PAST MIDDLE AGE AND AT THE END OF THE THIRD MILE SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD HIRED FAIRWAY TO DRIVE HER A PORTION AT LEAST OF THE DISTANCE
FIVE SHARP WORDS ARE SPOKEN AND A CRISIS ENSUES WHEN YEOBRIGHT WAS NOT WITH EUSTACIA HE WAS SITTING SLAVISHLY OVER HIS BOOKS WHEN HE WAS NOT READING HE WAS MEETING HER
BLOWN DOWN IN THE GALES OF PAST YEARS THE PLACE WAS CALLED THE DEVIL'S BELLOWS AND IT WAS ONLY NECESSARY TO COME THERE ON A MARCH OR NOVEMBER NIGHT TO DISCOVER THE FORCIBLE REASONS FOR THAT NAME
THAT WEAK GIRL HOW IS SHE GOING TO GET A MAN TO MARRY HER WHEN SHE CHOOSES BUT LET ME TELL YOU ONE THING AUNT
THE LEAVES OF THE HOLLYHOCKS HUNG LIKE HALF CLOSED UMBRELLAS THE SAP ALMOST SIMMERED IN THE STEMS AND FOLIAGE WITH A SMOOTH SURFACE GLARED LIKE METALLIC MIRRORS
STRANGE NOTIONS HAS HE SAID THE OLD MAN AH THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THAT SENDING TO SCHOOL IN THESE DAYS IT ONLY DOES HARM
A CERTAIN GLAD AND VOLUPTUOUS AIR OF TRIUMPH PERVADING HER EYES AT HAVING WON BY HER OWN UNAIDED SELF A MAN WHO WAS HER PERFECT COMPLEMENT IN ATTAINMENT APPEARANCE AND AGE ON THE YOUNG MAN'S PART
I KNEW SHE WAS SURE TO COME SHE VANISHED IN A HOLLOW FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN HER WHOLE FORM UNFOLDED ITSELF FROM THE BRAKE ONLY YOU HERE SHE EXCLAIMED WITH A DISAPPOINTED AIR WHOSE HOLLOWNESS WAS PROVED BY HER RISING REDNESS AND HER HALF GUILTY LOW LAUGH
THERE IS NO CHANCE OF GETTING RICH BUT WITH MY SYSTEM OF EDUCATION WHICH IS AS NEW AS IT IS TRUE I SHALL DO A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD TO MY FELLOW CREATURES DREAMS DREAMS
LET HIM BUT SINCE HE LOVED ME ONCE WE WILL NOT PAIN HIM BY TELLING HIM MY TROUBLE TOO SOON THE AIR IS FULL OF THE STORY I KNOW BUT GOSSIPS WILL NOT DARE TO SPEAK OF IT TO HIM FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS HIS CLOSENESS TO ME
IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY SYSTEM LEFT TO BE INVENTED THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT OUT AT THE UNIVERSITIES LONG BEFORE THIS TIME NEVER MOTHER THEY CANNOT FIND IT OUT BECAUSE THEIR TEACHERS DON'T COME IN CONTACT WITH THE CLASS WHICH DEMANDS SUCH A SYSTEM
ON MY ARRIVAL AT MY FATHER'S CAPITAL I WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND A LARGE DETACHMENT OF GUARDS DRAWN UP BEFORE THE GATE OF THE PALACE
OF TELLING ANY ONE WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME FOR THE PRINCE WHO GOVERNS THE KINGDOM IS YOUR FATHER'S GREATEST ENEMY AND HE WILL BE REJOICED TO FIND YOU IN HIS POWER I THANKED THE TAILOR FOR HIS COUNSEL AND SAID I WOULD DO WHATEVER HE ADVISED THEN BEING VERY HUNGRY
SHE ASKED AGAIN WITH A SIGH I HAVE BEEN IN THIS PLACE NOW FOR FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS AND YOU ARE THE FIRST MAN WHO HAS VISITED ME EMBOLDENED BY HER BEAUTY AND GENTLENESS I VENTURED TO REPLY BEFORE MADAM I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION
BUT TIME TEACHES US SUBMISSION AND I HAVE NOW GOT ACCUSTOMED TO HIS PRESENCE AND IF CLOTHES AND JEWELS COULD CONTENT ME I HAVE THEM IN PLENTY EVERY TENTH DAY FOR FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS I HAVE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HIM
WHO WHEN I HAD FINISHED BURST INTO FITS OF LAUGHTER WELL WERE YOU CALLED THE SILENT SAID HE NO NAME WAS EVER BETTER DESERVED
WHEN THE VESSEL HAD COME TO AN ANCHOR THEY PAID FIVE GOLD PIECES FOR THEIR PASSAGE AND WENT ASHORE NEVER HAVING BEEN IN BAGDAD BEFORE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO SEEK A LODGING
THE TWO PRINCES RETURNED HOME BUT THEIR ADVENTURE MADE SO LITTLE IMPRESSION ON THEM THAT THEY QUITE FORGOT TO SPEAK TO THEIR SISTER ON THE SUBJECT THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THEY WENT TO HUNT THEY MET THE SULTAN IN THE SAME PLACE AND HE INQUIRED WHAT ADVICE THEIR SISTER HAD GIVEN
THAT IS THE WAY IN WHICH A GENIUS TREATS THE WOMAN WHO HAS BETRAYED HIM IF I CHOSE I COULD KILL YOU ALSO BUT I WILL BE MERCIFUL AND CONTENT MYSELF WITH CHANGING YOU INTO A DOG AN ASS A LION OR A BIRD WHICHEVER YOU PREFER
RISE I FORGIVE THEE THEN TURNING TO THE PERSIAN HE SAID FAIR LADY NOW YOU KNOW WHO I AM LEARN ALSO THAT I HAVE SENT NOUREDDIN TO BALSORA TO BE KING AND AS SOON AS ALL NECESSARY PREPARATIONS ARE MADE
FROM WHICH I HAD SUFFERED BEFORE AND AT LENGTH WE REACHED BAGDAD MY FIRST CARE WAS TO PRESENT MYSELF BEFORE THE CALIPH AND GIVE HIM AN ACCOUNT OF MY EMBASSY HE ASSURED ME THAT MY LONG ABSENCE HAD DISQUIETED HIM MUCH BUT HE HAD NEVERTHELESS HOPED FOR THE BEST
ON THE SEASHORE AND AT THE MOUTHS OF THE RIVERS THE DIVERS SEEK FOR PEARLS AND IN SOME VALLEYS DIAMONDS ARE PLENTIFUL AFTER MANY DAYS I PETITIONED THE KING THAT I MIGHT RETURN TO MY OWN COUNTRY TO WHICH HE GRACIOUSLY CONSENTED MOREOVER HE LOADED ME WITH RICH GIFTS
YOU ALONE HAVE ESCAPED THE WILES OF THESE ANIMALS THEREFORE YOU MUST BE UNDER THE SPECIAL PROTECTION OF HEAVEN NOW THROUGH YOU THE WHOLE TOWN WILL BE ENRICHED WITHOUT FURTHER LOSS OF LIFE THEREFORE YOU SHALL NOT ONLY RECEIVE YOUR LIBERTY BUT I WILL ALSO BESTOW A FORTUNE UPON YOU
NOUREDDIN ON BEING AWOKE TOLD THE OLD MAN THAT THEY WERE STRANGERS AND MERELY WISHED TO PASS THE NIGHT THERE COME WITH ME SAID SCHEIH IBRAHIM I WILL LODGE YOU BETTER AND WILL SHOW YOU A MAGNIFICENT GARDEN BELONGING TO ME
HE TREMBLED WITH FEAR AND IMMEDIATELY INVENTED AN EXCUSE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL HE SAID I MUST TELL YOU THAT FOUR OR FIVE DAYS AGO SCHEIH IBRAHIM TOLD ME THAT HE WISHED TO HAVE AN ASSEMBLY OF THE MINISTERS OF HIS MOSQUE
I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN ME SAID PRINCE BAHMAN AND FOR THE ADVICE YOU HAVE GIVEN THOUGH I CANNOT FOLLOW IT BUT WHAT DANGERS CAN THERE BE IN THE ADVENTURE WHICH COURAGE AND A GOOD SWORD CANNOT MEET
I AT LAST DECIDED TO RETURN HOME LEAVING THE MINISTERS TO MAKE MY EXCUSES I LONGED TO TELL THEM WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE PRINCE ABOUT WHOSE FATE THEY FELT THE MOST DREADFUL ANXIETY BUT THE OATH I HAD SWORN KEPT ME SILENT
HOW SHOULD I WHEN I NEVER SAW HER BEFORE CUT HER HEAD OFF THEN IF SHE IS A STRANGER TO YOU AND I SHALL BELIEVE YOU ARE SPEAKING THE TRUTH AND WILL SET YOU AT LIBERTY
AGAIN BOWING HUMBLY BEFORE HIM I CAN ASSURE YOUR MAJESTY THAT HE HAS IN NO WAY EXAGGERATED HIS WEALTH AND GRANDEUR NOTHING CAN EQUAL THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS PALACE WHEN HE GOES ABROAD HIS THRONE IS PREPARED UPON THE BACK OF AN ELEPHANT
WHAT WAS MY NAME I AM SINDBAD I REPLIED WHOM MEN CALL THE SAILOR FOR I HAVE VOYAGED MUCH UPON MANY SEAS AND HOW COME YOU HERE ASKED THE KING I TOLD MY STORY CONCEALING NOTHING
IT WOULD LOOK ALL THE WORSE FOR DOROTHEA TO THOSE WHO KNEW ABOUT IT IT WOULD SEEM AS IF WE DISTRUSTED HER DISTRUSTED HER YOU KNOW THAT MISTER BROOKE HAD HIT ON AN UNDENIABLE ARGUMENT DID NOT TEND TO SOOTHE SIR JAMES
THAT THE ASSOCIATION WITH THIS MAN HAD BEEN FATAL TO HIM TRUE THAT IF HE HAD HAD THE THOUSAND POUNDS STILL IN HIS HANDS WITH ALL HIS DEBTS UNPAID HE WOULD HAVE RETURNED THE MONEY TO BULSTRODE
AND MANNERS MUST BE VERY MARKED INDEED BEFORE THEY CEASE TO BE INTERPRETED BY PRECONCEPTIONS EITHER CONFIDENT OR DISTRUSTFUL SHE WAS THOROUGHLY CHARMING TO HIM BUT OF COURSE HE THEORIZED A LITTLE ABOUT HIS ATTACHMENT
DO YOU KNOW WILBERFORCE MISTER CASAUBON SAID NO WELL WILBERFORCE WAS PERHAPS NOT ENOUGH OF A THINKER BUT IF I WENT INTO PARLIAMENT
HOWEVER WISDOM LIES MORE IN THOSE TWO QUALITIES THAN PEOPLE ARE APT TO IMAGINE I HOPE YOU KNOW BY THOSE MARKS WHAT YOUNG GENTLEMAN I MEAN YES I THINK I DO SAID MARY BRAVELY HER FACE GETTING MORE SERIOUS AND HER HANDS COLD
SAID THE GOOD NATURED PAINTER
THERE ARE EPISODES IN MOST MEN'S LIVES IN WHICH THEIR HIGHEST QUALITIES CAN ONLY CAST A DETERRING SHADOW OVER THE OBJECTS THAT FILL THEIR INWARD VISION
WELL NO NOT THE URGENCY OF THE THING BY AND BY PERHAPS IT MAY COME ROUND AS TO GOSSIP YOU KNOW SENDING HIM AWAY WON'T HINDER GOSSIP PEOPLE SAY WHAT THEY LIKE TO SAY NOT WHAT THEY HAVE CHAPTER AND VERSE FOR
AS TO THE EXCESSIVE RELIGIOUSNESS ALLEGED AGAINST MISS BROOKE HE HAD A VERY INDEFINITE NOTION OF WHAT IT CONSISTED IN AND THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD DIE OUT WITH MARRIAGE IN SHORT
WHEN HE LEFT HER TO GO OUT AGAIN HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT IT WAS TEN TIMES HARDER FOR HER THAN FOR HIM HE HAD A LIFE AWAY FROM HOME AND CONSTANT APPEALS TO HIS ACTIVITY ON BEHALF OF OTHERS HE WISHED TO EXCUSE EVERYTHING IN HER IF HE COULD
DEAR TERTIUS DON'T SET YOUR WIFE TO WRITE TO ME WHEN YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ASK IT IS A ROUNDABOUT WHEEDLING SORT OF THING WHICH I SHOULD NOT HAVE CREDITED YOU WITH I NEVER CHOOSE TO WRITE TO A WOMAN ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS
FOR AN ORNAMENTAL VASE DUE TO THE PAINTER'S FANCY
SHE WOULD MAKE US SO LIVELY AT LOWICK VERY FINE YOU TALK AS IF YOUNG WOMEN WERE TIED UP TO BE CHOSEN LIKE POULTRY AT MARKET AS IF I HAD ONLY TO ASK AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE ME SAID THE VICAR NOT CARING TO SPECIFY WE DON'T WANT EVERYBODY
FRED HESITATED AN INSTANT AND THEN WENT ON PLUNGINGLY I MIGHT GO INTO THE CHURCH NOW AND REALLY LOOK WHERE I MAY I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO
THAT NEVER EXPLAINED SCIENCE WHICH WAS THRUST AS AN EXTINGUISHER OVER ALL HER LIGHTS BUT YOU ARE FOND OF RIDING MISS BROOKE SIR JAMES PRESENTLY TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF SAYING I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU WOULD ENTER A LITTLE INTO THE PLEASURES OF HUNTING
HAD LOCKE THOSE TWO WHITE MOLES WITH HAIRS ON THEM OH I DARE SAY WHEN PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN SORT LOOKED AT HIM SAID DOROTHEA WALKING AWAY A LITTLE
MISTER FAREBROTHER PAUSED A MOMENT AND LOOKED AT MARY HE MEANT TO GIVE FRED HIS FULL ADVANTAGE BUT IT WOULD BE WELL HE THOUGHT TO CLEAR HER MIND OF ANY SUPERSTITIONS SUCH AS WOMEN SOMETIMES FOLLOW WHEN THEY DO A MAN THE WRONG OF MARRYING HIM AS AN ACT OF ATONEMENT
I SHOULD NEVER BE QUITE HAPPY IF I THOUGHT HE WAS UNHAPPY FOR THE LOSS OF ME
MISTER CASAUBON HAD COME UP TO THE TABLE TEACUP IN HAND AND WAS LISTENING WE MUST NOT INQUIRE TOO CURIOUSLY INTO MOTIVES HE INTERPOSED IN HIS MEASURED WAY
THE FAINT CLICK OF THE TRAP AS DRAGGED ABOUT BY THE WRITHING ANIMAL GUIDED HIM NOW AND REACHING THE SPOT HE STRUCK THE RABBIT ON THE BACK OF THE NECK WITH THE SIDE OF HIS PALM AND IT STRETCHED ITSELF OUT DEAD
TILL MOVED BY AMATORY CURIOSITY SHE TURNED HER EYES CRITICALLY UPON HIM YOU DON'T THINK I WOULD SHY THINGS AT YOU OH NO
O SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY HE SAID AS HE WORKED YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MARRIAGE MEANS COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT HIS ANNOUNCEMENT OF HIS OWN MARRIAGE HAD PRICKED HER ON TO THIS
BUT I FORGET I AM NO LONGER PRIVILEGED TO TEASE YOU EVER SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD JUDE SCREWED HIMSELF UP TO HEROIC KEY AND REPLIED MY DEAR SUE OF COURSE I WISH YOU JOY
AND THE SUSPENSE WAS OVER JUDE FELT RELIEVED THE MEAL AT HIS LODGING WAS A VERY SIMPLE AFFAIR AND AT TWO O'CLOCK THEY WENT OFF IN CROSSING THE PAVEMENT TO THE FLY SHE LOOKED BACK AND THERE WAS A FRIGHTENED LIGHT IN HER EYES COULD IT BE
THEN JUDE SEEMED TO SHAKE THE FUMES FROM HIS BRAIN AS HE STARED ROUND UPON THEM YOU PACK OF FOOLS HE CRIED WHICH ONE OF YOU KNOWS WHETHER I HAVE SAID IT OR NO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE RATCATCHER'S DAUGHTER IN DOUBLE DUTCH FOR ALL THAT YOUR BESOTTED HEADS CAN TELL
SHE DOES NOT REALIZE WHAT MARRIAGE MEANS HE PASSIVELY ACQUIESCED IN HER WISH TO GO IN AND THEY ENTERED BY THE WESTERN DOOR THE ONLY PERSON INSIDE THE GLOOMY BUILDING WAS A CHARWOMAN CLEANING
PLATO ARISTOTLE LUCRETIUS EPICTETUS SENECA ANTONINUS THEN I MUST MASTER OTHER THINGS THE FATHERS THOROUGHLY
ONE OF THE MISTRESSES CAME IN TO TURN OUT THE LIGHTS AND BEFORE DOING SO GAVE A FINAL GLANCE AT SUE'S COT WHICH REMAINED EMPTY
AND WHEN HE CAME OUT IT WAS NIGHT BY THE LIGHT OF THE FLICKERING LAMPS HE RAMBLED HOME TO SUPPER AND HAD NOT LONG BEEN SITTING AT TABLE WHEN HIS LANDLADY BROUGHT UP A LETTER THAT HAD JUST ARRIVED FOR HIM SHE LAID IT DOWN AS IF IMPRESSED
THAT THOUGH I LIKE MISTER PHILLOTSON AS A FRIEND I DON'T LIKE HIM IT IS A TORTURE TO ME TO LIVE WITH HIM AS A HUSBAND THERE NOW I HAVE LET IT OUT I COULDN'T HELP IT ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN PRETENDING I AM HAPPY
IF HE HAD BEEN A WOMAN HE MUST HAVE SCREAMED UNDER THE NERVOUS TENSION WHICH HE WAS NOW UNDERGOING BUT THAT RELIEF BEING DENIED TO HIS VIRILITY HE CLENCHED HIS TEETH IN MISERY BRINGING LINES ABOUT HIS MOUTH LIKE THOSE IN THE LAOCOON
AND THESE GIRLS ARE HELPING ME WASH THE INNERDS FOR BLACK PUDDINGS AND SUCH LIKE THEY TALKED A LITTLE MORE AND A LITTLE MORE AS THEY STOOD REGARDING EACH OTHER AND LEANING AGAINST THE HAND RAIL OF THE BRIDGE THE UNVOICED CALL OF WOMAN TO MAN
HE SAID LOOKING AWAY IT WOULD BE JUST ONE OF THOSE CASES IN WHICH MY EXPERIENCES GO CONTRARY TO MY DOGMAS SPEAKING AS AN ORDER LOVING MAN WHICH I HOPE I AM THOUGH I FEAR I AM NOT I SHOULD SAY YES
AS THE RAILWAY COMPANIES SAY OF THEIR TRAINS MISTER PHILLOTSON AND I ARE TO BE MARRIED QUITE SOON IN THREE OR FOUR WEEKS WE HAD INTENDED AS YOU KNOW TO WAIT TILL I HAD GONE THROUGH MY COURSE OF TRAINING AND OBTAINED MY CERTIFICATE SO AS TO ASSIST HIM IF NECESSARY IN THE TEACHING
BUT FOR THIS BLOW HE MIGHT HAVE BORNE WITH HIS FATE WITH SUE AS COMPANION HE COULD HAVE RENOUNCED HIS AMBITIONS WITH A SMILE WITHOUT HER IT WAS INEVITABLE
SHE CROSSED TO HIS LITTLE GRATE AND VERY LITTLE FIRE BUT AS THE WATER DRIPPED FROM HER AS SHE MOVED THE IDEA OF DRYING HERSELF WAS ABSURD WHATEVER HAVE YOU DONE DARLING HE ASKED WITH ALARM THE TENDER EPITHET SLIPPING OUT UNAWARES
WITHIN THE MULLIONED AND TRANSOMED WINDOWS HE COULD SEE THE BLACK BROWN AND FLAXEN CROWNS OF THE SCHOLARS OVER THE SILLS AND TO PASS THE TIME AWAY HE WALKED DOWN TO THE LEVEL TERRACE WHERE THE ABBEY GARDENS ONCE HAD SPREAD HIS HEART THROBBING IN SPITE OF HIM
OH YOU WOULD RATHER TALK OF HER PERSON THAN HER MIND WOULD YOU VERY WELL I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO DENY EMMA'S BEING PRETTY PRETTY SAY BEAUTIFUL RATHER CAN YOU IMAGINE ANY THING NEARER PERFECT BEAUTY THAN EMMA ALTOGETHER
SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES IN TALKING AND LISTENING AND FORMING ALL THESE SCHEMES IN THE IN BETWEENS THAT THE EVENING FLEW AWAY AT A VERY UNUSUAL RATE AND THE SUPPER TABLE WHICH
AND THEREFORE CANNOT ALLOW HERSELF TO FEEL SO MUCH PAIN AS PLEASURE EVERY FRIEND OF MISS TAYLOR MUST BE GLAD TO HAVE HER SO HAPPILY MARRIED
SERLE UNDERSTANDS BOILING AN EGG BETTER THAN ANY BODY I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU MISS BATES
AT THE RISK IN HER OPINION THE GREAT RISK OF ITS BEING ALL IN VAIN ENSCOMBE HOWEVER WAS GRACIOUS GRACIOUS IN FACT IF NOT IN WORD HIS WISH OF STAYING LONGER EVIDENTLY DID NOT PLEASE BUT IT WAS NOT OPPOSED
AND MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE
AND I AGREE WITH YOU ENTIRELY THAT IT WILL BE A MUCH BETTER THING INVITE HIM TO DINNER EMMA AND HELP HIM TO THE BEST OF THE FISH AND THE CHICKEN
YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
AND MISS CHURCHILL FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM NOBODY WAS SURPRIZED EXCEPT HER BROTHER AND HIS WIFE WHO HAD NEVER SEEN HIM AND WHO WERE FULL OF PRIDE AND IMPORTANCE WHICH THE CONNEXION WOULD OFFEND
THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER THE FRIENDS FROM WHOM SHE HAD JUST PARTED THOUGH VERY GOOD SORT OF PEOPLE MUST BE DOING HER HARM THEY WERE A FAMILY OF THE NAME OF MARTIN
IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF IT WAS ON THE WEDDING DAY OF THIS BELOVED FRIEND THAT EMMA FIRST SAT IN MOURNFUL THOUGHT OF ANY CONTINUANCE THE WEDDING OVER AND THE BRIDE PEOPLE GONE
IN LONG SENTENCES OF REFINED NONSENSE TO COMBINE LIBERAL ACQUIREMENTS WITH ELEGANT MORALITY UPON NEW PRINCIPLES AND NEW SYSTEMS AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY
ONLY ONE MORE PAPA ONLY FOR MISTER ELTON POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM
AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED
AND HAD SENSE AND ENERGY AND SPIRITS THAT MIGHT BE HOPED WOULD BEAR HER WELL AND HAPPILY THROUGH ITS LITTLE DIFFICULTIES AND PRIVATIONS AND THEN THERE WAS SUCH COMFORT IN THE VERY EASY DISTANCE OF RANDALLS FROM HARTFIELD
HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE ALL ARE EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS AND HOPED BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY THROUGH THE EVENING AND BE ATTACKED BY NO REGRETS BUT HER OWN
COMPREHENDED MANY SUCH NOT UNFREQUENTLY THROUGH EMMA'S PERSUASION HE HAD SOME OF THE CHOSEN AND THE BEST TO DINE WITH HIM BUT EVENING PARTIES WERE WHAT HE PREFERRED AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY
I HEARD SOMETHING BREATHING SAW SOMETHING CROUCHED TOGETHER CLOSE BESIDE ME I HELD MY BREATH TRYING TO SEE WHAT IT WAS IT BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY INTERMINABLY THEN SOMETHING SOFT AND WARM AND MOIST PASSED ACROSS MY HAND ALL MY MUSCLES CONTRACTED
HOW THE HAIR BEGAN TO SPREAD OVER THE EXPOSED LIMBS HOW THEIR FOREHEADS FELL AWAY AND THEIR FACES PROJECTED HOW THE QUASI HUMAN INTIMACY I HAD PERMITTED MYSELF WITH SOME OF THEM IN THE FIRST MONTH OF MY LONELINESS BECAME A SHUDDERING HORROR TO RECALL THE CHANGE WAS SLOW AND INEVITABLE
THEN THE NOISE OVERHEAD BEGAN AGAIN
I HEARD SOME STRANGE NOISES AND THRUST THE KNUCKLES OF MY LEFT HAND INTO MY EYES I BECAME AWARE OF A DISAGREEABLE ODOR LIKE THAT OF A MONKEY'S CAGE ILL CLEANED BEYOND THE ROCK OPENED AGAIN UPON A GRADUAL SLOPE OF SUNLIT GREENERY
THEN SUDDENLY HIS CAREER WAS CLOSED HE HAD TO LEAVE ENGLAND A JOURNALIST OBTAINED ACCESS TO HIS LABORATORY IN THE CAPACITY OF LABORATORY ASSISTANT
IN TURN I RECALLED EACH ONE I HAD SEEN AND TRIED TO DRAW SOME AUGURY OF ASSISTANCE FROM MY MEMORY THEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A STAGHOUND BAY AND AT THAT REALISED A NEW DANGER I TOOK LITTLE TIME TO THINK
BUT WITH A CERTAIN LACK OF PRACTICAL SENSE WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY BANE I HAD MADE IT A MILE OR MORE FROM THE SEA AND BEFORE I HAD DRAGGED IT DOWN TO THE BEACH THE THING HAD FALLEN TO PIECES PERHAPS IT IS AS WELL THAT I WAS SAVED FROM LAUNCHING IT
AM I ELIGIBLE FOR SOLID FOOD I ASKED THANKS TO ME HE SAID
BUT THEY DO NOT HELP THE TELLING OF THE STORY
THOUGH WHEN THERE'S MUCH OF A SEA WITHOUT ANY WIND
HE HAD A LARGE ALMOST LIPLESS MOUTH EXTRAORDINARY LANK ARMS LONG THIN FEET AND BOW LEGS AND STOOD WITH HIS HEAVY FACE THRUST FORWARD STARING AT US HE WAS DRESSED LIKE MONTGOMERY AND HIS WHITE HAIRED COMPANION IN JACKET AND TROUSERS OF BLUE SERGE
I HAD HALF A MIND TO DROWN MYSELF THEN BUT AN ODD WISH TO SEE THE WHOLE ADVENTURE OUT A QUEER IMPERSONAL SPECTACULAR INTEREST IN MYSELF RESTRAINED ME
HE HAD LONG SINCE LOST SPEECH AND ACTIVE MOVEMENT AND THE LANK HAIR OF THE LITTLE BRUTE GREW THICKER EVERY DAY AND HIS STUMPY CLAWS MORE ASKEW
I TURNED ONCE MORE ALMOST PASSIONATELY NOW TO HAMMERING TOGETHER STAKES AND BRANCHES TO FORM A RAFT FOR MY ESCAPE I FOUND A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES I AM AN EXTREMELY UNHANDY MAN
AND CROUCHED IN THE BOTTOM OF ITS LITTLE CAGE OVERBOARD WITH EM BAWLED THE CAPTAIN OVERBOARD WITH EM
MONTGOMERY STEERED US ROUND AND INTO A NARROW LITTLE DOCK EXCAVATED IN THE BEACH THEN THE MAN ON THE BEACH HASTENED TOWARDS US THIS DOCK AS I CALL IT WAS REALLY A MERE DITCH JUST LONG ENOUGH AT THIS PHASE OF THE TIDE TO TAKE THE LONGBOAT
AS I APPROACHED THE MONSTER LIFTED ITS GLARING EYES TO MINE ITS LIPS WENT TREMBLING BACK FROM ITS RED STAINED TEETH AND IT GROWLED MENACINGLY IT WAS NOT AFRAID AND NOT ASHAMED THE LAST VESTIGE OF THE HUMAN TAINT HAD VANISHED
FOR THERE WAS NO ROOM ABOARD I HAD RECOVERED FROM MY HYSTERICAL PHASE BY THIS TIME AND ANSWERED HIS HAIL AS HE APPROACHED BRAVELY ENOUGH
I HEARD A LIGHT FOOTFALL BEHIND ME AND TURNING QUICKLY SAW THE BIG HYENA SWINE PERHAPS A DOZEN YARDS AWAY HIS HEAD WAS BENT DOWN HIS BRIGHT EYES WERE FIXED UPON ME HIS STUMPY HANDS CLENCHED AND HELD CLOSE BY HIS SIDE
SOME OF IT AT LEAST MY LOOSE CASH WOULD CERTAINLY BE EMPLOYED IN IMPROVING MY COLLECTION OF MUSIC AND BOOKS AND THE BULK OF YOUR FORTUNE WOULD BE LAID OUT IN ANNUITIES ON THE AUTHORS OR THEIR HEIRS NO EDWARD I SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO DO WITH IT
AND EAGER AS SHE HAD LONG BEEN TO QUIT IT COULD NOT WHEN IT CAME TO THE POINT BID ADIEU TO THE HOUSE IN WHICH SHE HAD FOR THE LAST TIME ENJOYED THOSE HOPES AND THAT CONFIDENCE IN WILLOUGHBY WHICH WERE NOW EXTINGUISHED FOR EVER WITHOUT GREAT PAIN
I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
NO PRIDE NO HAUTEUR AND YOUR SISTER JUST THE SAME ALL SWEETNESS AND AFFABILITY ELINOR WISHED TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT LUCY STILL PRESSED HER TO OWN THAT SHE HAD REASON FOR HER HAPPINESS AND ELINOR WAS OBLIGED TO GO ON
STEALING AWAY THROUGH THE WINDING SHRUBBERIES NOW JUST BEGINNING TO BE IN BEAUTY TO GAIN A DISTANT EMINENCE WHERE FROM ITS GRECIAN TEMPLE HER EYE WANDERING OVER A WIDE TRACT OF COUNTRY TO THE SOUTH EAST
WHAT YOU THOUGHT NOBODY COULD DANCE BECAUSE A CERTAIN PERSON THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS IS GONE I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL CRIED SIR JOHN THAT WILLOUGHBY WERE AMONG US AGAIN THIS AND MARIANNE'S BLUSHING GAVE NEW SUSPICIONS TO EDWARD
DON'T PALM ALL YOUR ABUSES OF LANGUAGES UPON ME
I WOULD NOT ASK SUCH A QUESTION FOR THE WORLD SUPPOSING IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY ARE NOT ENGAGED WHAT DISTRESS WOULD NOT SUCH AN ENQUIRY INFLICT AT ANY RATE IT WOULD BE MOST UNGENEROUS I SHOULD NEVER DESERVE HER CONFIDENCE AGAIN AFTER FORCING FROM HER A CONFESSION
AND ONLY OCCASIONALLY RUDE TO HIS WIFE AND HER MOTHER SHE FOUND HIM VERY CAPABLE OF BEING A PLEASANT COMPANION AND ONLY PREVENTED FROM BEING SO ALWAYS BY TOO GREAT AN APTITUDE TO FANCY HIMSELF AS MUCH SUPERIOR TO PEOPLE IN GENERAL
BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY WERE VISITED BY SIR JOHN AND MISSUS JENNINGS WHO HAVING HEARD OF THE ARRIVAL OF A GENTLEMAN AT THE COTTAGE CAME TO TAKE A SURVEY OF THE GUEST WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS MOTHER IN LAW SIR JOHN WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING
SHE LIKED HIM HOWEVER UPON THE WHOLE MUCH BETTER THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND IN HER HEART WAS NOT SORRY THAT SHE COULD LIKE HIM NO MORE NOT SORRY TO BE DRIVEN BY THE OBSERVATION OF HIS EPICURISM HIS SELFISHNESS AND HIS CONCEIT
DO NOT BLAME HIM HOWEVER FOR DEPARTING FROM HIS CHARACTER WHERE THE DEVIATION IS NECESSARY BUT YOU REALLY DO ADMIT THE JUSTICE OF WHAT I HAVE SAID IN HIS DEFENCE I AM HAPPY AND HE IS ACQUITTED NOT ENTIRELY
YOU MUST THINK WRETCHEDLY INDEED OF WILLOUGHBY IF AFTER ALL THAT HAS OPENLY PASSED BETWEEN THEM YOU CAN DOUBT THE NATURE OF THE TERMS ON WHICH THEY ARE TOGETHER HAS HE BEEN ACTING A PART IN HIS BEHAVIOUR TO YOUR SISTER ALL THIS TIME
FOR HIS HEART HAD NOT THE INDIFFERENCE OF LUCY'S NOR COULD HIS CONSCIENCE HAVE QUITE THE EASE OF ELINOR'S LUCY WITH A DEMURE AND SETTLED AIR SEEMED DETERMINED TO MAKE NO CONTRIBUTION TO THE COMFORT OF THE OTHERS
AND IT SEEMED AS IF HER TEARS WERE EVEN THEN RESTRAINED WITH DIFFICULTY SHE AVOIDED THE LOOKS OF THEM ALL COULD NEITHER EAT NOR SPEAK AND AFTER SOME TIME ON HER MOTHER'S SILENTLY PRESSING HER HAND WITH TENDER COMPASSION HER SMALL DEGREE OF FORTITUDE
HE COLOURED AS HE REPLIED YOU ARE VERY KIND BUT I HAVE NO IDEA OF RETURNING INTO DEVONSHIRE IMMEDIATELY MY VISITS TO MISSUS SMITH ARE NEVER REPEATED WITHIN THE TWELVEMONTH
AND CRYING OVER THE PRESENT REVERSE FOR THE CHIEF OF THE MORNING
AND HER MOTHER WHO CONCLUDED THAT A PROMISE HAD BEEN MADE BY WILLOUGHBY THE NIGHT BEFORE OF CALLING ON HER
OTHERWISE LONDON WOULD HAVE NO CHARMS FOR ME I HAVE NOT SPIRITS FOR IT ELINOR WAS SOON CALLED TO THE CARD TABLE BY THE CONCLUSION OF THE FIRST RUBBER AND THE CONFIDENTIAL DISCOURSE OF THE TWO LADIES WAS THEREFORE AT AN END
IT IS HER WAY HERE IN THE SUMMER TIDE TO BATHE HER IN YONDER POOL UP THE WATER AND IT WAS THE SAME POOL WHEREIN RALPH HAD BATHED AND SHE HATH ME AND MY NIECE AND TWO OTHER WOMEN TO HOLD UP THE SILKEN CLOTH BETWIXT HER BODY AND THE WORLD SO THAT I HAVE SEEN HER AS GOD MADE HER
THEN SHALL SHE SHOW ME THE WAY TO THE WELL AT THE WORLD'S END AND I SHALL DRINK THEREOF AND NEVER GROW OLD EVEN AS SHE ENDURETH IN YOUTH AND SHE SHALL LOVE ME FOR EVER AND I HER FOR EVER SO HE THOUGHT
THUS THEY CAME INTO A LITTLE WOOD AND PASSED THROUGH IT AND THEN RALPH COULD SEE THAT THE MEN WERE SIX BESIDES ROGER BY THE GLIMMER OF THE GROWING DAWN HE SAW BEFORE THEM A SPACE OF MEADOWS WITH HIGH HEDGES ABOUT THEM AND A DIM LINE
WHEN THOU WENTEST FORTH BEFORE I WAS TROUBLED AT THY GOING AND FEARED FOR THY RETURNING BUT NOW I FEAR NOT
THEN SHE SAID AS SHE DREW HER HAND AWAY AND SPAKE IN SUCH A VOICE AND SO LOOKING AT HIM THAT EVERY WORD WAS AS A CARESS TO HIM THY SOUL IS COMING BACK TO THEE MY FRIEND AND THOU ART WELL AT EASE IS IT NOT SO O YEA
O FOR A DRAUGHT OF THE WELL AT THE WORLD'S END THAT THE LOVE MIGHT LAST LONG AND LONG SO HE WENT ON A WHILE BETWIXT THE TREES AND THE THICKETS TILL IT WAS A LITTLE PAST NOON BUT ALL ON A SUDDEN A PANIC FEAR TOOK HIM
AND FOUND THE SADDLE BAGS ON HIM AND TOOK FROM THEM BREAD AND FLESH AND A FLASK OF GOOD WINE AND BROUGHT THEM TO THE LADY WHO LAUGHED AND SAID THOU ART A GOOD SEEKER AND NO ILL FINDER THEN SHE GAVE THE WOUNDED MAN TO DRINK OF THE WINE
AND NONE VERY BIG AS OF GREAT LORDS THEY WERE WELL AND STOUTLY BUILDED
HOW RALPH DEPARTED FROM THE BURG OF THE FOUR FRITHS HIMSEEMED HE HAD SCARCE BEEN ASLEEP A MINUTE ERE AWOKE WITH A SOUND OF SOMEONE SAYING SOFTLY MASTER
SO SHE SPAKE AND RALPH YET LAY ON THE GRASS AND HEARD NOUGHT BUT THE KNIGHT'S FACE WAS DARK AND SWOLLEN WITH ANGER AS HE ANSWERED MY SWORN FRIEND YEA I UNDERSTAND THY GIBE
BUT AT LAST HE HEARD THE TINKLE OF A LITTLE BELL COMING TOWARDS HIM SO HE STOOD STILL AND GOT THE HILT OF HIS SWORD READY TO HIS HAND AND THE TINKLE DREW NEARER AND HE HEARD WITHAL THE TRAMPLE OF SOME RIDING BEAST SO HE WENT TOWARD THE SOUND AND PRESENTLY IN A CLEARER PLACE OF THE WOOD
WHEN THE FOLK SHOULD HAVE GONE THEIR WAYS HOME HE SAW NO FOLK IN THE STREET SAVE HERE AND THERE AN OLD WOMAN SITTING AT THE DOOR OF HER HOUSE AND MAYBE A YOUNG CHILD WITH HER AS HE CAME TO WHERE THE STREET TURNED SOMEWHAT
EVEN SUCH A CARLINE WAS SITTING ON A CLEAN WHITE DOOR STEP ON THE SUNNY SIDE SOMEWHAT SHADED BY A TALL ROSE LAUREL TREE IN A GREAT TUB AND SHE SANG AS SHE SAT SPINNING AND RALPH STAYED TO LISTEN IN HIS IDLE MOOD
SCOWLING AND HIS FACE WHITE AS CHALK THEN HE SPAKE TO HER COLDLY AND STERNLY STRETCHING OUT HIS BLOODY SWORD BEFORE HER I HAVE DONE THY BIDDING AND SLAIN MY VERY EARTHLY FRIEND OF FRIENDS FOR THY SAKE
THE ROSINESS OF HER ANCLES SHOWED AMIDST HER WHITE SANDAL THONGS AND THERE WERE SILVER RINGS AND GOLD ON HER ARMS ALONG WITH THE IRON RING NOW SHE LIFTED UP HER EYES AND LOOKED SHYLY AT RALPH
AND MOREOVER HE IS MANY YARDS AWAY FROM ME AND SILVERFAX SO BEFORE THOU ART IN THE SADDLE WHERE SHALL I BE YEA FOR THE KNIGHT WAS HANDLING HIS ANLACE THOU MAYST CAST IT AND PERADVENTURE MAYST HIT SILVERFAX AND NOT ME
AND RAN TO THE OLD WOMAN AND CRIED OUT TO HER IS SHE COME IS SHE COME THE CARLINE LAUGHED AND SAID NAY SHE IS NOT BUT THOU ART COME PRAISE BE TO THE SAINTS BUT WHAT AILETH THEE NAY FEAR NOT SHE SHALL COME AT LAST
BEFORE HE SAW THE WESTERING SUN SHINE BRIGHTLY FROM A NAKED SWORD AND THEN ANOTHER SPRANG UP TO MEET IT AND HE HEARD FAINTLY THE CLASH OF STEEL
HE COWERED AWAY WITH WILD CRIES AND PRAYERS FOR MERCY BUT I DREW MY KNIFE AND HELD IT TO HIS THROAT UNTIL HE HAD OBEYED ME
BELATED WANDERERS UPON THE MOUNTAINS SPOKE OF GANGS OF ARMED MEN MASKED STEALTHY AND NOISELESS WHO FLITTED BY THEM IN THE DARKNESS THESE TALES AND RUMOURS TOOK SUBSTANCE AND SHAPE AND WERE CORROBORATED AND RE CORROBORATED UNTIL THEY RESOLVED THEMSELVES INTO A DEFINITE NAME
THE CONTENTS ASSUMED A DULL MAHOGANY COLOUR AND A BROWNISH DUST WAS PRECIPITATED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE GLASS JAR HA HA HE CRIED CLAPPING HIS HANDS AND LOOKING AS DELIGHTED AS A CHILD WITH A NEW TOY WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT
WHO WAS BENDING OVER A DISTANT TABLE ABSORBED IN HIS WORK AT THE SOUND OF OUR STEPS HE GLANCED ROUND AND SPRANG TO HIS FEET WITH A CRY OF PLEASURE I'VE FOUND IT I'VE FOUND IT HE SHOUTED TO MY COMPANION RUNNING TOWARDS US WITH A TEST TUBE IN HIS HAND
I ANSWERED THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH I GENERALLY HAVE CHEMICALS ABOUT AND OCCASIONALLY DO EXPERIMENTS WOULD THAT ANNOY YOU BY NO MEANS LET ME SEE WHAT ARE MY OTHER SHORTCOMINGS I GET IN THE DUMPS AT TIMES AND DON'T OPEN MY MOUTH FOR DAYS ON END
I CAN DRIVE YOU SAID LESTRADE GOOD AND GREGSON CAN COME INSIDE WITH ME YOU TOO DOCTOR YOU HAVE TAKEN AN INTEREST IN THE CASE AND MAY AS WELL STICK TO US I ASSENTED GLADLY AND WE ALL DESCENDED TOGETHER OUR PRISONER MADE NO ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE BUT STEPPED CALMLY INTO THE CAB WHICH HAD BEEN HIS
THERE HE REMAINED UNTIL CLOSING TIME AND WHEN HE CAME OUT HE WAS SO FAR GONE THAT I KNEW THE GAME WAS IN MY OWN HANDS
NOT TO HAVE USELESS FACTS ELBOWING OUT THE USEFUL ONES BUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM I PROTESTED WHAT THE DEUCE IS IT TO ME HE INTERRUPTED IMPATIENTLY YOU SAY THAT WE GO ROUND THE SUN IF WE WENT ROUND THE MOON
UNLESS HE HAS SOME VERY GOOD REASON FOR DOING SO HIS IGNORANCE WAS AS REMARKABLE AS HIS KNOWLEDGE OF CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS HE APPEARED TO KNOW NEXT TO NOTHING
YOU MUST NOT THINK I AM SULKY WHEN I DO THAT JUST LET ME ALONE AND I'LL SOON BE RIGHT WHAT HAVE YOU TO CONFESS NOW
JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET THREE WEEKS HAD PASSED SINCE JEFFERSON HOPE AND HIS COMRADES HAD DEPARTED FROM SALT LAKE CITY JOHN FERRIER'S HEART WAS SORE WITHIN HIM WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG MAN'S RETURN AND OF THE IMPENDING LOSS OF HIS ADOPTED CHILD
DRIVE ME TO HALLIDAY'S PRIVATE HOTEL SAID HE WHEN I HAD HIM FAIRLY INSIDE MY CAB MY HEART JUMPED SO WITH JOY THAT I FEARED LEST AT THIS LAST MOMENT MY ANEURISM MIGHT GO WRONG I DROVE ALONG SLOWLY WEIGHING IN MY OWN MIND WHAT IT WAS BEST TO DO I MIGHT TAKE HIM RIGHT OUT INTO THE COUNTRY
FIVE BOTANY VARIABLE WELL UP IN BELLADONNA OPIUM AND POISONS GENERALLY KNOWS NOTHING OF PRACTICAL GARDENING SIX GEOLOGY
HE REMARKED TO SHERLOCK HOLMES MY CAB'S AT THE DOOR IF YOU'LL LOOSE MY LEGS I'LL WALK DOWN TO IT I'M NOT SO LIGHT TO LIFT AS I USED TO BE
HAD HE DISCOVERED A GOLD MINE GREATER DELIGHT COULD NOT HAVE SHONE UPON HIS FEATURES DOCTOR WATSON MISTER SHERLOCK HOLMES SAID STAMFORD INTRODUCING US
YOUNG STAMFORD LOOKED RATHER STRANGELY AT ME OVER HIS WINE GLASS
HE STAGGERED BACK WITH A LIVID FACE AND I SAW THE PERSPIRATION BREAK OUT UPON HIS BROW WHILE HIS TEETH CHATTERED IN HIS HEAD AT THE SIGHT I LEANED MY BACK AGAINST THE DOOR AND LAUGHED LOUD AND LONG I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT VENGEANCE WOULD BE SWEET BUT I HAD NEVER HOPED FOR THE CONTENTMENT OF SOUL WHICH NOW POSSESSED ME
WHEN HE HEARD THE CLICK OF THE LATCH AND LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW SAW A STOUT SANDY HAIRED MIDDLE AGED MAN COMING UP THE PATHWAY HIS HEART LEAPT TO HIS MOUTH FOR THIS WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE GREAT BRIGHAM YOUNG HIMSELF FULL OF TREPIDATION FOR HE KNEW THAT SUCH A VISIT BODED HIM LITTLE GOOD
SAID ESHLEY SETTING HIS CANVAS IN POSITION I FORBID IT I ABSOLUTELY FORBID IT STORMED ADELA
AND HAVE A THOROUGH RESPITE FROM EVERYTHING CONNECTED WITH POLITICS I WONT LET HIM EVEN THINK OF THEM IVE HAD THE PICTURE OF CROMWELL DISSOLVING THE LONG PARLIAMENT TAKEN DOWN FROM THE STAIRCASE AND EVEN THE PORTRAIT
WHAT COBDENISM MIGHT DO FOR THE CAMEL INDUSTRY RANKS AMONG THE BEST OF THE RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO FREE TRADE LITERATURE WHILE THE VIEWS ON FOREIGN POLICY ENUNCIATED FROM A ROOF IN YARKAND
MILKING STOOL AND BRANDING IRON HIS HOME WAS IN A PARK LIKE VILLA DOTTED DISTRICT THAT ONLY JUST ESCAPED THE REPROACH OF BEING SUBURBAN ON ONE SIDE OF HIS GARDEN THERE ABUTTED A SMALL PICTURESQUE MEADOW
AND PASSED TO THE RABBIT SHOOTING COUSIN AS THE NEXT OF KIN EMMA LADBRUK DRIFTED OUT OF ITS HISTORY AS A BEE THAT HAD WANDERED IN AT AN OPEN WINDOW MIGHT FLIT ITS WAY OUT AGAIN ON A COLD GREY MORNING SHE STOOD WAITING
LOOKING LIKE A DEAD AUTUMN LEAF WHICH THE WINTER WINDS STILL PUSHED HITHER AND THITHER HAD ONCE BEEN MARTHA CRALE FOR SEVENTY ODD YEARS SHE HAD BEEN MARTHA MOUNTJOY FOR LONGER THAN ANYONE COULD REMEMBER
HIS REMARKABLE PICTURE OX IN A MORNING ROOM LATE AUTUMN WAS ONE OF THE SENSATIONS AND SUCCESSES OF THE NEXT PARIS SALON AND WHEN IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXHIBITED AT MUNICH IT WAS BOUGHT BY THE BAVARIAN GOVERNMENT
AND STRODE SWIFTLY UP THE GARDEN ESHLEY RAN TO HEAD IT TOWARDS THE GATE BUT ONLY SUCCEEDED IN QUICKENING ITS PACE FROM A WALK TO A LUMBERING TROT
AND SOME CONVENTIONAL HIEROGLYPHIC TO SHOW THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO BE A CHRISTMAS OR NEW YEAR GIFT THERE WOULD BE A COUNTERFOIL WITH SPACE FOR THE RECIPIENTS NAME AND THE DATE OF ARRIVAL AND ALL YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO WOULD BE TO SIGN AND DATE THE COUNTERFOIL ADD A CONVENTIONAL HIEROGLYPHIC
SPORTING BLUFF AND THE DAMSELS OWN PAPER ALL PITCHED ON KHARTOUM FOR THE SAME WEEK IT WAS PERHAPS A DESIRE TO OUT DISTANCE ALL POSSIBLE COMPETITION THAT INFLUENCED THE MANAGEMENT
FOR THE JOURNEY THERE AND BACK THIS WAS IN MANY RESPECTS THE MOST REMARKABLE OF ALL THE PRESS STAMPEDES THAT WERE EXPERIENCED AT THIS TIME THERE WAS NO MAKE BELIEVE ABOUT THE UNDERTAKING PROPRIETOR MANAGER
NOONTIDE PEACE A STUDY OF TWO DUN COWS UNDER A WALNUT TREE WAS FOLLOWED BY A MID DAY SANCTUARY A STUDY OF A WALNUT TREE WITH TWO DUN COWS UNDER IT
A WORDSWORTH BOOKLET NEXT CHRISTMAS AND ANOTHER CALENDAR THE CHRISTMAS AFTER WITH THE SAME PROBLEM OF HAVING TO WRITE SUITABLE LETTERS OF THANKFULNESS NO THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO DROP ALL FURTHER ALLUSION TO THE CALENDAR AND SWITCH OFF ON TO SOME OTHER TOPIC BUT WHAT OTHER TOPIC
OF A BEE WANDERING IN AT A WINDOW ON A SUMMERS DAY USED AT FIRST TO WATCH HER WITH A KIND OF FRIGHTENED CURIOSITY SHE WAS SO OLD AND SO MUCH A PART OF THE PLACE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO THINK OF HER EXACTLY AS A LIVING THING OLD SHEP
OF THE DAILY INTELLIGENCER ONE OF THE MOST SOLID AND RESPECTED ORGANS OF LIBERAL OPINION IN ITS DECISION TO TRANSFER ITS OFFICES FOR THREE OR FOUR WEEKS FROM FLEET STREET TO EASTERN TURKESTAN ALLOWING OF COURSE A NECESSARY MARGIN OF TIME
THE FEATHERED COMBATANT HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE WHEN HARD PRESSED TO TAKE REFUGE ON THE BED AND FREELY AVAILED HIMSELF OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THE PIGLING NEVER QUITE SUCCEEDED IN HURLING HIMSELF ON TO THE SAME EMINENCE BUT IT WAS NOT FROM WANT OF TRYING
AS THE CHIEF OF A KURDISH NOMAD CLAN WOULD TO A JAPANESE TEA SHOP GIRL ESHLEY STOOD VERY NEAR THE GATE WHILE HE STUDIED THE ANIMALS APPEARANCE AND DEMEANOUR ADELA PINGSFORD CONTINUED TO SAY NOTHING
LATIMER HAD SCARCELY SHUT HIS BEDROOM DOOR BEFORE HE WAS IMMERSED IN A SHEAF OF NOTES AND PAMPHLETS
AND THE HEAD GROOM WAS LEFT IN CHARGE THE LADY HARRIET WHO REMAINED AT THE HALL WAS A GREAT INVALID AND NEVER WENT OUT IN THE CARRIAGE AND THE LADY ANNE PREFERRED RIDING ON HORSEBACK WITH HER BROTHER OR COUSINS
THAT I THINK WOULD MAKE ME FEEL RATHER QUEER IF I WAS ONE OF THEM IF YOU EVER DO GET RICH SAID GOVERNOR GRAY LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER ACROSS THE TOP OF HIS CAB YOU'LL DESERVE IT JERRY
MY LEGS WERE NOT STIFF NOW AND I DID THE WORK WITH PERFECT EASE HE'S GROWING YOUNG WILLIE WE MUST GIVE HIM A LITTLE GENTLE WORK NOW AND BY MID SUMMER HE WILL BE AS GOOD AS LADYBIRD HE HAS A
PREACHING TO US AND THEN DOING THE SAME HIMSELF LOOK HERE MATES SAID JERRY THE GENTLEMAN OFFERED ME HALF A CROWN EXTRA BUT I DIDN'T TAKE IT TWAS QUITE PAY ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEE HOW GLAD HE WAS TO CATCH THAT TRAIN
WE CALL THEM DUMB ANIMALS AND SO THEY ARE FOR THEY CANNOT TELL US HOW THEY FEEL BUT THEY DO NOT SUFFER LESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO WORDS BUT I MUST NOT DETAIN YOU NOW
I TROTTED QUIETLY ALONG THE WHEELS HARDLY MAKING A SOUND ON THE SOFT ROAD FOR A GOOD WHILE NEITHER MASTER NOR JOHN SPOKE AND THEN MASTER BEGAN IN A SERIOUS VOICE
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG SIR SAID JOHN AND HE SPRANG OUT OF THE DOG CART AND CAME TO MY HEAD AND LOOKED ALL ABOUT HE TRIED TO LEAD ME FORWARD COME ON BEAUTY WHAT'S THE MATTER
JAKES AND THE LADY I WAS SOLD TO A CORN DEALER AND BAKER WHOM JERRY KNEW AND WITH HIM HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE GOOD FOOD AND FAIR WORK IN THE FIRST HE WAS QUITE RIGHT
BUT FOR ALL THAT SHE BEGGED ME TO GO AND MEET HIM BUT WHAT MUST WE DO THERE'S THE HORSE TO GET HOME AS WELL AS THE BODY AND THAT WILL BE NO EASY MATTER
PERHAPS YOU COME TO A REGULAR BLOCK UP AND HAVE TO STAND STILL FOR MINUTES TOGETHER TILL SOMETHING CLEARS OUT INTO A SIDE STREET OR THE POLICEMAN INTERFERES YOU HAVE TO BE READY FOR ANY CHANCE TO DASH FORWARD IF THERE BE AN OPENING
TILL WE CAME TO HIS GATE THERE WAS A SHORT DRIVE UP TO THE HOUSE BETWEEN TALL EVERGREENS BLANTYRE ALIGHTED AT THE GATE AND WAS GOING TO OPEN IT FOR LADY ANNE BUT SHE SAID I WILL WAIT FOR YOU HERE
WHEN THERE WAS A GROAN AND A CRACK AND A SPLITTING SOUND AND TEARING CRASHING DOWN AMONG THE OTHER TREES CAME AN OAK TORN UP BY THE ROOTS AND IT FELL RIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD JUST BEFORE US
HIS SHOVEL DROPPED AND HIS HANDS RAISED AS WE CAME NEAR HE MADE A SIGN TO SPEAK
I SHALL NEVER FORGET THAT NIGHT WALK IT WAS MORE THAN THREE MILES ROBERT LED ME ON VERY SLOWLY
AND I HAVE FOLLOWED THE HOUNDS A GREAT MANY TIMES THOUGH I KNOW YOU DO NOT APPROVE OF LADIES HUNTING BUT STILL THAT IS THE FACT AND I INTEND TO TRY THIS LIZZIE
AND BOX AFTER BOX WAS DRAGGED UP AND LODGED ON THE TOP OF THE CAB OR SETTLED BY THE SIDE OF THE DRIVER AT LAST ALL WAS READY AND WITH HIS USUAL JERK AT THE REIN AND SLASH OF THE WHIP
CAN YOU TAKE ME TO THE SOUTH EASTERN RAILWAY SAID THE YOUNG MAN THIS UNLUCKY FALL HAS MADE ME LATE I FEAR BUT IT IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE THAT I SHOULD NOT LOSE THE TWELVE O'CLOCK TRAIN I SHOULD BE MOST THANKFUL IF YOU COULD GET ME THERE IN TIME
AND YOU'LL GIVE ME A CHANCE TO TALK THINGS OVER WITH YOU SHE SHOOK HER HEAD WITH A FAINT SMILE I'M NOT THINKING OF THE STAGE I'VE HAD ANOTHER OFFER THAT'S ALL THE RELIEF WAS HARDLY LESS GREAT
BUT SHE FELT WHAT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN UNPERCEIVED BY MANY A YOUNG LADY WHO HAD TAKEN A FIRST IN CLASSICS THE INELUCTABLE FATALITY OF THE TALE THE DREAD SWAY IN IT OF THE SAME MYSTERIOUS LUCK WHICH PULLED THE THREADS OF HER OWN SMALL DESTINY
FINALLY DREW HIM TO HIS FEET FROM HER WRITING TABLE WHERE SHE SAT OVER A PILE OF LETTERS ANNA LIFTED HER HAPPY SMILE THE IMPULSE TO PRESS HIS LIPS TO IT MADE HIM COME CLOSE AND DRAW HER UPWARD SHE THREW HER HEAD BACK
EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON THEY HAD GONE OUT IN THE MOTOR TRAVERSING MILES OF SOBER TINTED LANDSCAPE IN WHICH HERE AND THERE
THE RETREAT IN WHICH AS ONE MIGHT FANCY
RETURNED HIS GREETING ALMOST GAILY HIS FIRST GLANCE SHOWED HIM THAT SHE HAD REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND THE CHANGE IN HER APPEARANCE GAVE HIM THE MEASURE OF HER FEARS FOR THE FIRST TIME HE SAW IN HER AGAIN THE SIDELONG GRACE THAT HAD CHARMED HIS EYES IN PARIS
HE MERELY PERCEIVED THAT THE YOUNG MAN WAS UNACCOUNTABLY SURPRISED AT FINDING HIM WITH MISS VINER AND THAT THE EXTENT OF HIS SURPRISE MIGHT COVER ALL MANNER OF IMPLICATIONS DARROW'S FIRST IDEA WAS THAT OWEN
AND HIS MEETING WITH MISSUS LEATH THE PREVIOUS SPRING HAD GIVEN IT A DEFINITE DIRECTION WITH SUCH A COMRADE TO FOCUS AND STIMULATE HIS ENERGIES HE FELT MODESTLY BUT AGREEABLY SURE OF
IS IT TRUE IS IT REALLY TRUE
LOOK THERE ARE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT
HER LONG RESIDENCE ON GALLIC SOIL HAD NOT MITIGATED HER HOSTILITY TOWARD THE CREED AND CUSTOMS OF THE RACE BUT THOUGH SHE ALWAYS REFERRED TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AS THE SCARLET WOMAN AND TOOK THE DARKEST VIEWS OF FRENCH PRIVATE LIFE
SHE BROKE OFF CONFUSED AND HE QUESTIONED WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO KNOW BETTER THE COLOUR ROSE TO HER FOREHEAD HOW COULD SHE TELL HIM WHAT SHE SCARCELY DARED OWN TO HERSELF
BORNE ON FANTASTIC CHORDS FLOATED TO THE GROUP ABOUT THE TEA TABLE UNDER ITS INFLUENCE MADAME DE CHANTELLE'S MEDITATIVE PAUSES INCREASED IN LENGTH AND FREQUENCY
INCREASED BY ITS FADED HANGINGS ITS SLIGHTLY FRAYED AND THREADBARE RUGS EVERYTHING IN IT WAS HARMONIOUSLY SHABBY
WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU'LL ONLY LET ME SHE RAISED A HAND AS THOUGH TO CHECK HIM IT'S EXTREMELY FRIENDLY OF YOU I DO BELIEVE YOU MEAN IT AS A FRIEND BUT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WHY FINDING ME AS YOU SAY
IT'S ALL THE ODDER BECAUSE MY MOTHER IN LAW SINCE HER SECOND MARRIAGE HAS LIVED SO MUCH IN THE COUNTRY THAT SHE'S PRACTICALLY LOST SIGHT OF ALL HER OTHER AMERICAN FRIENDS BESIDES WHICH
HE FELT HER YIELD SLIGHTLY TO HIS CLASP AND HURRIED ON WITHOUT GIVING HER TIME TO ANSWER ISN'T IT A PITY TO SPOIL OUR GOOD TIME TOGETHER BY REGRETTING ANYTHING YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE TO PREVENT OUR HAVING IT SHE DREW BACK FREEING HER HANDS HER FACE
I USED TO PASS YOU ON THE STAIRS SHE REMINDED HIM YES
TO WALK AFTER HER DOWN THE AISLE OF A THEATRE
HIS OWN IDEAS ABOUT SOPHY VINER WERE TOO MIXED AND INDETERMINATE FOR HIM NOT TO FEEL THE RISK OF SUCH AN EXPERIMENT YET HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE INTOLERABLE POSITION OF APPEARING TO PRESS IT ON THE WOMAN HE DESIRED ABOVE ALL OTHERS TO PROTECT
AND CONJECTURING THAT HER GOVERNESS MIGHT BE WITH HER HE BETOOK HIMSELF THE NEXT MORNING TO THE TERRACE WHENCE HE WANDERED ON TO THE GARDENS AND THE WALKS BEYOND THE ATMOSPHERE WAS STILL AND PALE
AND INSTEAD OF ANSWERING HIM SHE BROKE OUT THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN WANTING YOU TO KNOW THE OTHER DAY IN PARIS I SAW MISS VINER SHE SAW HIM FLUSH WITH THE INTENSITY OF HIS SURPRISE YOU SENT FOR HER
