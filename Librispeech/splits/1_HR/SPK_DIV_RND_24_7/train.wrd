THOUGH HIS HEART WAS GREATLY RELIEVED BY SUCH UNLOOKED FOR MILDNESS IT WAS NOT JUST AT THAT MOMENT IN HIS POWER TO SAY ANYTHING TO THE PURPOSE RETURNING IN SILENCE TO HIS SEAT THEREFORE
THE GENERAL WAS FURIOUS IN HIS ANGER AND THEY PARTED IN DREADFUL DISAGREEMENT HENRY IN AN AGITATION OF MIND WHICH MANY SOLITARY HOURS WERE REQUIRED TO COMPOSE
AND IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD EVEN WALK ABOUT THE HOUSE RATHER THAN REMAIN FIXED FOR ANY TIME IN THE PARLOUR HER LOSS OF SPIRITS WAS A YET GREATER ALTERATION IN HER RAMBLING AND HER IDLENESS
HER MOTHER COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THEM NOW TO BE GREATLY INCREASED SHE COULD NEITHER SIT STILL NOR EMPLOY HERSELF FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER WALKING ROUND THE GARDEN AND ORCHARD AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF NOTHING BUT MOTION WAS VOLUNTARY
HER INTIMACY THERE HAD MADE HIM SERIOUSLY DETERMINE ON HER BEING HANDSOMELY LEGACIED HEREAFTER AND TO SPEAK OF HER THEREFORE AS THE ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGED FUTURE HEIRESS OF FULLERTON NATURALLY FOLLOWED
THERE WAS NOT ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN WAS UNKNOWN HER FATHER HAD NO WARD AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO CHILDREN
AND IF SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AT ALL IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF AT LEAST SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIES
BUT HER GLOWING CHEEK AND BRIGHTENED EYE MADE HER MOTHER TRUST THAT THIS GOOD NATURED VISIT WOULD AT LEAST SET HER HEART AT EASE FOR A TIME AND GLADLY THEREFORE DID SHE LAY ASIDE THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE MIRROR FOR A FUTURE HOUR
AND DELIGHTED IN ALL THE EXCELLENCIES OF HER CHARACTER AND TRULY LOVED HER SOCIETY I MUST CONFESS THAT HIS AFFECTION ORIGINATED IN NOTHING BETTER THAN GRATITUDE OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT A PERSUASION OF HER PARTIALITY FOR HIM
THAT WOULD BE TURNING YOUR VISIT INTO AN EVIL INDEED WHEREVER YOU ARE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONTENTED BUT ESPECIALLY AT HOME BECAUSE THERE YOU MUST SPEND THE MOST OF YOUR TIME I DID NOT QUITE LIKE AT BREAKFAST
HAD EVER SINCE HIS INTRODUCTION TO ISABELLA BEEN GRADUALLY INCREASING AND BY MERELY ADDING TWICE AS MUCH FOR THE GRANDEUR OF THE MOMENT BY DOUBLING WHAT HE CHOSE TO THINK THE AMOUNT OF MISTER MORLAND'S PREFERMENT TREBLING HIS PRIVATE FORTUNE
UPON SUCH INTELLIGENCE THE GENERAL HAD PROCEEDED FOR NEVER HAD IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO DOUBT ITS AUTHORITY THORPE'S INTEREST IN THE FAMILY BY HIS SISTER'S APPROACHING CONNECTION WITH ONE OF ITS MEMBERS
SHE KNEW IT WOULD BE SO MUCH LESS SO TO HER FATHER THAT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE HIM REALLY SUSPECT SUCH A CIRCUMSTANCE AS HER NOT BEING THOUGHT PERFECT BY EVERY BODY EMMA KNOWS I NEVER FLATTER HER SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY
WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY MISSUS BATES LET ME PROPOSE YOUR VENTURING ON ONE OF THESE EGGS AN EGG BOILED VERY SOFT IS NOT UNWHOLESOME
THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENTIRELY A MATCH OF AFFECTION WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF
EVERY BODY SAID THAT MISTER WESTON WOULD NEVER MARRY AGAIN OH DEAR NO MISTER WESTON WHO HAD BEEN A WIDOWER SO LONG
EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO THAT MISS TAYLOR AND I MET WITH HIM IN BROADWAY LANE WHEN BECAUSE IT BEGAN TO DRIZZLE HE DARTED AWAY WITH SO MUCH GALLANTRY AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT
AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD AND SO ARTLESSLY IMPRESSED BY THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY THING IN SO SUPERIOR A STYLE TO WHAT SHE HAD BEEN USED TO
BY THE BYE I HAVE NOT WISHED YOU JOY BEING PRETTY WELL AWARE OF WHAT SORT OF JOY YOU MUST BOTH BE FEELING I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE WHO CRIED MOST
BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND WHERE GIRLS MIGHT BE SENT TO BE OUT OF THE WAY AND SCRAMBLE THEMSELVES INTO A LITTLE EDUCATION
BEEN MISTRESS OF HIS HOUSE FROM A VERY EARLY PERIOD HER MOTHER HAD DIED TOO LONG AGO FOR HER TO HAVE MORE THAN AN INDISTINCT REMEMBRANCE OF HER CARESSES AND HER PLACE HAD BEEN SUPPLIED BY AN EXCELLENT WOMAN AS GOVERNESS
THOUGH AS FAR AS SHE WAS HERSELF CONCERNED IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON
I THINK VERY WELL OF MISTER ELTON AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I HAVE OF DOING HIM A SERVICE MISTER ELTON IS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN TO BE SURE AND A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN AND I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM
AND ANIMATED MISTER WOODHOUSE FOR SOME TIME MISTER KNIGHTLEY HAD A CHEERFUL MANNER WHICH ALWAYS DID HIM GOOD AND HIS MANY INQUIRIES AFTER POOR ISABELLA AND HER CHILDREN WERE ANSWERED MOST SATISFACTORILY WHEN THIS WAS OVER MISTER WOODHOUSE GRATEFULLY OBSERVED
BUT THE QUIET PROSINGS OF THREE SUCH WOMEN MADE HER FEEL THAT EVERY EVENING SO SPENT WAS INDEED ONE OF THE LONG EVENINGS SHE HAD FEARFULLY ANTICIPATED AS SHE SAT ONE MORNING LOOKING FORWARD TO EXACTLY SUCH A CLOSE OF THE PRESENT DAY
THAT WAS YOUR DOING PAPA YOU GOT HANNAH THAT GOOD PLACE NOBODY THOUGHT OF HANNAH TILL YOU MENTIONED HER JAMES IS SO OBLIGED TO YOU I AM VERY GLAD I DID THINK OF HER
WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE
AND MISSUS GODDARD THREE LADIES ALMOST ALWAYS AT THE SERVICE OF AN INVITATION FROM HARTFIELD AND WHO WERE FETCHED AND CARRIED HOME SO OFTEN THAT MISTER WOODHOUSE THOUGHT IT NO HARDSHIP FOR EITHER JAMES OR THE HORSES
AS SAD A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCH THOUGHTS
UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART BUT MY DEAR PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES THEY ARE SILLY THINGS AND BREAK UP ONE'S FAMILY CIRCLE GRIEVOUSLY
SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN AND HOW IMPORTANT TO HER TO BE SECURE OF A COMFORTABLE PROVISION
I WISH YOU MAY NOT CATCH COLD DIRTY SIR LOOK AT MY SHOES NOT A SPECK ON THEM
AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE
AND WHILE HIS HOSPITALITY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING
IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE
RATIONAL OR PLAYFUL THE EVIL OF THE ACTUAL DISPARITY IN THEIR AGES AND MISTER WOODHOUSE HAD NOT MARRIED EARLY WAS MUCH INCREASED BY HIS CONSTITUTION AND HABITS
THROUGH AT HARTFIELD BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND
WHICH HAD SOON FOLLOWED ISABELLA'S MARRIAGE ON THEIR BEING LEFT TO EACH OTHER WAS YET A DEARER TENDERER RECOLLECTION SHE HAD BEEN A FRIEND AND COMPANION SUCH AS FEW POSSESSED INTELLIGENT
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE TO MATCH WITH THE LIBRARY WAS THE CONSERVATORY ORNAMENTED WITH RARE FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED IN CHINA JARS AND IN THE MIDST OF THE GREENHOUSE
DORMICE ARE BAD NEIGHBORS FOR US WHO DO NOT EAT THEM PRESERVED AS THE ROMANS DID WHAT DID THE ROMANS EAT THEM SAID THE GARDENER ATE DORMICE
TAKE THESE AND THE COUNT PLACED THE PACKET IN THE MAN'S HANDS NOW THIS IS NOT ALL HE SAID YOU CANNOT LIVE UPON YOUR FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS I SHALL STILL HAVE MY PLACE NO
CAVALCANTI SAID DEBRAY A FINE NAME SAID MORREL YES SAID CHATEAU RENAUD THESE ITALIANS ARE WELL NAMED AND BADLY DRESSED YOU ARE FASTIDIOUS CHATEAU RENAUD REPLIED DEBRAY
THOUGH THEY DO SAY AS FAT AS A DORMOUSE IT IS NOT A WONDER THEY ARE FAT SLEEPING ALL DAY AND ONLY WAKING TO EAT ALL NIGHT LISTEN LAST YEAR I HAD FOUR APRICOTS THEY STOLE ONE
MAKE FIFTEEN YOU ARE FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD HOW LONG MUST YOU HAVE SERVED TO CLAIM THE PENSION OH SIR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND HOW MUCH IS THE PENSION A HUNDRED CROWNS
THE MAN EXECUTED ONE AFTER THE OTHER THE THREE SIGNS GIVEN BY THE COUNT IN SPITE OF THE FRIGHTFUL CONTORTIONS OF THE RIGHT HAND CORRESPONDENT WHO NOT UNDERSTANDING THE CHANGE BEGAN TO THINK THE GARDENER HAD GONE MAD
STAY LOOK AT
TAKING THE ROAD TO ORLEANS LEAVING THE VILLAGE OF LINAS WITHOUT STOPPING AT THE TELEGRAPH WHICH FLOURISHED ITS GREAT BONY ARMS AS HE PASSED THE COUNT REACHED THE TOWER OF MONTLHERY
AS TO THE LEFT HAND ONE HE CONSCIENTIOUSLY REPEATED THE SAME SIGNALS WHICH WERE FINALLY TRANSMITTED TO THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR NOW YOU ARE RICH SAID MONTE CRISTO YES REPLIED THE MAN
YOU LIVE BADLY ON YOUR THOUSAND FRANCS BADLY ENOUGH BUT YET I DO LIVE YES BUT YOU HAVE A WRETCHEDLY SMALL GARDEN TRUE THE GARDEN IS NOT LARGE
ARE THEY GOING TO PUT HIM IN THE MINISTRY NOT YET I THINK MORE LIKELY HE HAS BEEN SPECULATING ON THE BOURSE AND HAS LOST MONEY
AND FASTENED THE STRING TO THE NAIL AND CAST A LOOK AROUND THE MAN AT THE TELEGRAPH SAID HE MUST EITHER ENGAGE A GARDENER OR DEVOTE HIMSELF PASSIONATELY TO AGRICULTURE
I HAVE SEEN HIM FROM MY WINDOW STANDING IN THE MOONLIGHT ON THE BRINK OF THE BLUFF OVERLOOKING THE HUDSON WITH HIS ARMS STRETCHED OUT TO THE HEAVENS AS THOUGH IN APPEAL I THOUGHT AT THE TIME THAT HE WAS PRAYING
I MANAGED TO ELUDE THEIR SEARCH LIGHTS MOST OF THE TIME BUT I WAS ALSO LOSING GROUND BY THESE TACTICS AND SO I DECIDED TO HAZARD EVERYTHING ON A STRAIGHT AWAY COURSE AND LEAVE THE RESULT TO FATE AND THE SPEED OF MY MACHINE
GENTLY I PULLED ON IT TO STRENGTHEN ITS HOLD BUT WHETHER IT WOULD BEAR THE WEIGHT OF MY BODY I DID NOT KNOW IT MIGHT BE BARELY CAUGHT UPON THE VERY OUTER VERGE OF THE ROOF
AND THAT I SMILED IT WAS ALL GREEK TO ME BUT THE MORE I BEGGED HER TO EXPLAIN THE MORE POSITIVE BECAME HER DENIALS OF MY REQUEST AND SO IN VERY HOPELESSNESS I DESISTED
I FELT MYSELF OVER FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND FROM HEAD TO FOOT I WAS CLOTHED
THE CONCUSSION NEARLY CAPSIZED HER AND WITH A SICKENING PLUNGE SHE HURTLED DOWNWARD THROUGH THE DARK NIGHT
I RECEIVED A TELEGRAM FROM HIM ASKING ME TO COME TO HIM AT ONCE I HAD
UNUSUAL I THEREFORE DREW NEAR AND DISCOVERED THAT THE POSSESSOR OF THE PEERING FACE WAS NONE OTHER THAN SAB THAN HE WAS SLIGHTLY PUT OUT AT BEING DETECTED AND COMMANDED ME TO KEEP THE MATTER TO MYSELF EXPLAINING THAT THE PASSAGE FROM THE TOWER
THERE WAS COMPARATIVELY LITTLE CAUSE FOR FEAR ON THE EVENING BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE I SAW THEM APPROACHING ALONG ONE OF THE GREAT AVENUES WHICH LEAD INTO THE PLAZA FROM THE EAST
THEIR BULLETS EXPLODE WHEN THEY STRIKE AN OBJECT WELL THE OPAQUE OUTER COATING IS BROKEN BY THE IMPACT EXPOSING A GLASS CYLINDER ALMOST SOLID IN THE FORWARD END OF WHICH IS A MINUTE PARTICLE OF RADIUM POWDER
WHERE I HAD SEEN HIM ON THOSE OTHER NIGHTS WITH HIS ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION TO THE SKIES THERE WERE NO MARKS OF VIOLENCE ON THE BODY AND WITH THE AID OF A LOCAL PHYSICIAN THE CORONER'S JURY QUICKLY REACHED A DECISION OF DEATH FROM HEART FAILURE
THEY KNOW THAT I AM THE DAUGHTER OF TEN THOUSAND JEDDAKS THAT I TRACE MY ANCESTRY STRAIGHT BACK WITHOUT A BREAK TO THE BUILDER OF THE FIRST GREAT WATERWAY
ALTHOUGH I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE TERM A RELIGIOUS MAN SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER I HAD RETURNED HOME FROM MY LAST VISIT
BUT I HOPE NEVERTHELESS THAT I MAY BE PRESENT THE NEXT TIME THAT ANY MARTIAN GREEN RED PINK OR VIOLET HAS THE TEMERITY TO EVEN SO MUCH AS FROWN ON YOU MY PRINCESS
MISSUS ALLEN WAS ONE OF THAT NUMEROUS CLASS OF FEMALES WHOSE SOCIETY CAN RAISE NO OTHER EMOTION THAN SURPRISE AT THERE BEING ANY MEN IN THE WORLD WHO COULD LIKE THEM WELL ENOUGH TO MARRY THEM
WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR FIFTEEN SONNETS IN CELEBRATION OF HER CHARMS AND WENT TO HER CHAIR IN GOOD HUMOUR WITH EVERYBODY
FOR MY PART I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING I LIKE SO WELL IN THE WHOLE ROOM I ASSURE YOU HOW UNCOMFORTABLE IT IS WHISPERED CATHERINE NOT TO HAVE A SINGLE ACQUAINTANCE HERE
NOR WAS SHE ONCE CALLED A DIVINITY BY ANYBODY YET CATHERINE WAS IN VERY GOOD LOOKS AND HAD THE COMPANY ONLY SEEN HER THREE YEARS BEFORE THEY WOULD NOW HAVE THOUGHT HER EXCEEDINGLY HANDSOME
AND AFTERWARDS DROVE THROUGH THOSE STREETS WHICH CONDUCTED THEM TO THE HOTEL SHE WAS COME TO BE HAPPY AND SHE FELT HAPPY ALREADY THEY WERE SOON SETTLED IN COMFORTABLE LODGINGS IN PULTENEY STREET
THAT SHE COULD NOT RELIEVE THE IRKSOMENESS OF IMPRISONMENT BY THE EXCHANGE OF A SYLLABLE WITH ANY OF HER FELLOW CAPTIVES AND WHEN AT LAST ARRIVED IN THE TEA ROOM SHE FELT YET MORE THE AWKWARDNESS OF HAVING NO PARTY TO JOIN
HER FATHER INSTEAD OF GIVING HER AN UNLIMITED ORDER ON HIS BANKER OR EVEN PUTTING AN HUNDRED POUNDS BANK BILL INTO HER HANDS GAVE HER ONLY TEN GUINEAS AND PROMISED HER MORE WHEN SHE WANTED IT
AND MARY EXCLAIMED A DINGLE BELL AND TRUTH TO TELL IN FULL BLOOM I DECLARE THE SQUIRE NOW CLUCKED TO HIS NAG AND AS THEY RODE AWAY HE SAID NOW COME WITH ME AND YOU SHALL SEE A FIELD WITH COWSLIPS BRIGHT
AND DINGLE BELLS ARE DELICATE FLOWERS AND GROW BEST WHERE THEY ARE SHELTERED BY THE WOODS IF YOU HAD PLANTED THEM AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AS I WISHED YOU TO THE WIND WOULD NOT HAVE KILLED THEM MARY DID NOT REPLY TO THIS
IT WAS ALWAYS VERY WELCOME WHEN IT CAME BUT SHE DID NOT DEPEND ON IT MISSUS ALLEN WAS SO LONG IN DRESSING THAT THEY DID NOT ENTER THE BALLROOM TILL LATE THE SEASON WAS FULL THE ROOM CROWDED
AND NOW MY PAPA'S COMING HOME FOR SO HE SURELY SAID AH SAID THE SQUIRE LOOKING AT HER CURIOUSLY I M AFRAID YOU ARE GETTING WAY AHEAD OF TIME SEE HERE MARY
AND NOW WAS THE TIME FOR A HEROINE WHO HAD NOT YET PLAYED A VERY DISTINGUISHED PART IN THE EVENTS OF THE EVENING TO BE NOTICED AND ADMIRED EVERY FIVE MINUTES BY REMOVING SOME OF THE CROWD GAVE GREATER OPENINGS FOR HER CHARMS
THEIR NAMES WERE HOBART AND ROBART THE LITTLE GIRL'S NAME WAS MARY AND SHE WAS VERY HAPPY INDEED WHEN HER FATHER AND HER BROTHERS WERE AT HOME FOR THEY PETTED HER AND PLAYED GAMES WITH HER AND LOVED HER VERY DEARLY
TO HAVE BEEN ABANDONED BY ALL AUTHORITIES PUBLISHED SOME INGENIOUS LETTERS TO ME AT THE TIME WHEN THAT EVENT WAS CHRONICLED ARGUING THAT SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE
SIX YEARS EARLIER AND THE HISTORIAN IN THAT CASE IS LE CAT
SAYS THE CHANCELLOR ANEW AND SATISFY MYSELF ON THE SUBJECT OF THEIR RESIDING WITH THEIR COUSIN
OF SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION IS GIVEN I DO NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO ADD TO THESE NOTABLE FACTS AND THAT GENERAL REFERENCE TO THE AUTHORITIES WHICH WILL BE FOUND AT PAGE
IT WAS IN SOME OFF HAND MANNER NEVER MEANT TO GO RIGHT THUS IN THE MIDST OF THE MUD AND AT THE HEART OF THE FOG SITS THE LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR IN HIS HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY
RINGING IN THE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF THE VERY LITTLE COUNSEL DROPS AND THE FOG KNOWS HIM NO MORE EVERYBODY LOOKS FOR HIM NOBODY CAN SEE HIM I WILL SPEAK WITH BOTH THE YOUNG PEOPLE
AND AT HER HOUSE IN TOWN UPON THIS MUDDY MURKY AFTERNOON PRESENTS HIMSELF AN OLD FASHIONED OLD GENTLEMAN ATTORNEY AT LAW AND EKE SOLICITOR OF THE HIGH COURT OF CHANCERY
AT WHICH POINT I THOUGHT THE JUDGE'S EYE HAD A CAST IN MY DIRECTION WAS ALMOST IMMACULATE THERE HAD BEEN HE ADMITTED A TRIVIAL BLEMISH OR SO IN ITS RATE OF PROGRESS
WHAT HAS BEEN DOING AND STILL IS DOING IN THIS CONNEXION I MENTION HERE THAT EVERYTHING SET FORTH IN THESE PAGES CONCERNING THE COURT OF CHANCERY IS SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE
THE SHORT HAND WRITERS THE REPORTERS OF THE COURT AND THE REPORTERS OF THE NEWSPAPERS INVARIABLY DECAMP WITH THE REST OF THE REGULARS WHEN JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE COMES ON THEIR PLACES ARE A BLANK
WITH SERIOUS FACES AS PLAYERS MIGHT ON SUCH AN AFTERNOON THE VARIOUS SOLICITORS IN THE CAUSE SOME TWO OR THREE OF WHOM HAVE INHERITED IT FROM THEIR FATHERS
AS ONE OF A COMPANY OF SOME HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEN AND WOMEN NOT LABOURING UNDER ANY SUSPICIONS OF LUNACY THAT THE COURT OF CHANCERY THOUGH THE SHINING SUBJECT OF MUCH POPULAR PREJUDICE
SUFFER ANY WRONG THAT CAN BE DONE YOU RATHER THAN COME HERE WHO HAPPEN TO BE IN THE LORD CHANCELLOR'S COURT THIS MURKY AFTERNOON BESIDES THE LORD CHANCELLOR THE COUNSEL IN THE CAUSE TWO OR THREE COUNSEL
AND AN UTTER INABILITY TO CONTROL OUR THOUGHTS OR POWER OF MOTION CAN BE CALLED SLEEP THIS IS IT AND YET WE HAVE A CONSCIOUSNESS OF ALL THAT IS GOING ON ABOUT US AND IF WE DREAM AT SUCH A TIME WORDS WHICH ARE REALLY SPOKEN OR SOUNDS WHICH REALLY EXIST AT THE MOMENT
DON'T BE AFRAID I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BE YOUR GRANDFATHER YOU'RE A SWEET GIRL I LIKE YOU HERE THEY ARE IN FACT AS HE THREW HIMSELF AT ONE DEXTEROUS DIVE INTO HIS FORMER SEAT MISTER BROWNLOW RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY OLIVER
TO DEPOSIT IN THE LOCAL SAVINGS BANK THE SUM OF FIVE AND TWENTY POUNDS FOR HIS SOLE USE AND BENEFIT AT THIS THE TWO WOMEN SERVANTS LIFTED UP THEIR HANDS AND EYES AND SUPPOSED THAT MISTER GILES PULLING OUT HIS SHIRT FRILL REPLIED NO NO
SAID THE DOCTOR NONE AT ALL SIR REPLIED MISTER GILES WITH MUCH GRAVITY WELL SAID THE DOCTOR I AM SORRY TO HEAR IT BECAUSE YOU DO THAT SORT OF THING ADMIRABLY PRAY HOW IS BRITTLES
AND IT WAS LATE BEFORE THEY RETIRED WITH LIGHT AND THANKFUL HEARTS TO TAKE THAT REST OF WHICH AFTER THE DOUBT AND SUSPENSE THEY HAD RECENTLY UNDERGONE THEY STOOD MUCH IN NEED OLIVER ROSE NEXT MORNING IN BETTER HEART
WERE THE SCOWLING FEATURES OF THE MAN WHO HAD ACCOSTED HIM IN THE INN YARD
RUNNING UP TO THE CHAISE DOOR GILES POPPED OUT HIS NIGHTCAP AGAIN PREPARATORY TO MAKING SOME REPLY WHEN HE WAS SUDDENLY PULLED BACK BY A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO OCCUPIED THE OTHER CORNER OF THE CHAISE AND WHO EAGERLY DEMANDED WHAT WAS THE NEWS
AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES LIKE MISFORTUNES SELDOM COME ALONE HER SITUATION WAS INDEED ONE OF NO COMMON TRIAL AND DIFFICULTY
AND AFTERWARDS SHOOK HANDS ACCORDING TO THEIR INVARIABLE CUSTOM NOW MISS MAYLIE SAID MISTER BROWNLOW TO RETURN TO THE SUBJECT IN WHICH YOUR HUMANITY IS SO MUCH INTERESTED
EVEN IF SHE HAD KNOWN HOW TO DO SO IT WAS SCARCELY TO BE THOUGHT OF FOR THE SAME REASON ONCE THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HER OF SEEKING ASSISTANCE FROM HARRY BUT THIS AWAKENED THE RECOLLECTION OF THEIR LAST PARTING AND IT SEEMED UNWORTHY OF HER TO CALL HIM BACK WHEN
NOT TO BE DISCHARGED ON EMPTY AIR BUT TO DIE AWAY IN THE INNERMOST RECESSES OF HIS STOMACH MISTER BROWLOW WAS NO LESS SURPRISED ALTHOUGH HIS ASTONISHMENT WAS NOT EXPRESSED IN THE SAME ECCENTRIC MANNER HE DREW HIS CHAIR NEARER TO MISS MAYLIE'S AND SAID
AND HE'D UNCOMMONLY LIKE TO SEE ANY MAN OFFER TO DO IT RESPONDED MISTER GRIMWIG KNOCKING HIS STICK UPON THE FLOOR HAVING GONE THUS FAR THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN SEVERALLY TOOK SNUFF

FOR INDEED MISFORTUNE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF MY HOUSE WHEN I PERCEIVED YOU I WAS JUST ASKING MYSELF WHETHER I HAD NOT WISHED HARM TOWARDS THOSE POOR MORCERFS WHICH WOULD HAVE JUSTIFIED THE PROVERB OF
WHICH WHATEVER MAY BE SAID ABOUT THE EQUALITY OF DEATH IS AT LEAST A LAST PROOF OF THE LUXURY SO PLEASING IN LIFE THIS WINDING SHEET WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF CAMBRIC
OH DEAR YES AND IF YOU WERE AT ROME THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH WOULD MAKE NO MORE DIFFICULTY ABOUT PAYING THE MONEY ON MY RECEIPT THAN YOU HAVE JUST DONE PARDON ME COUNT PARDON ME THEN I MAY KEEP THIS MONEY YES SAID DANGLARS
BUT DID YOU RECEIVE MY LETTER YESTERDAY YES I HAVE BROUGHT MY RECEIPT
AND PRESENTED HIMSELF AT HIS COUSIN'S WITH A FACE MADE UP FOR THE OCCASION AND WHICH HE COULD ALTER AS MIGHT BE REQUIRED AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE MOURNING COACHES ROLLED INTO THE PAVED COURT
HE SLEEPS INDEED AND THIS IS THE MORE STRANGE SINCE THE LEAST CONTRADICTION KEEPS HIM AWAKE ALL NIGHT
AFTER EXPRESSING ACUTE SYMPATHY WITH THE FATHER
IN THE STREET THE LAMPS OF THE TAXI CABS SENT OUT GLISTENING SHEENS ALONG THE ALREADY BLACK PAVEMENT THE UNWELCOME NOVEMBER RAIN HAD PERVERSELY STOLEN THE DAY'S LAST HOUR AND PAWNED IT WITH THAT ANCIENT FENCE THE NIGHT
RATHER I DON'T WANT TO COMMIT MORAL SUICIDE QUESTION HAVE YOU NO INTERESTS LEFT
SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE INSULT OFFERED TO US BY THAT WRETCH SO SHE ASKED PERMISSION TO TRAVEL AND IS SHE GONE THE OTHER NIGHT SHE LEFT
IF IT WASN'T APPENDICITIS INFLUENZA MAYBE WHAT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTIETH STREET
WANT TO GO DOWN THERE AND SEE IF IT'S DIRTY FRENCH RIVERS ALL BROWN OR BLACK SO WERE SOUTHERN RIVERS TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS MEANT FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOUGHNUTS HE COULD LIVE ON IT THREE MONTHS AND SLEEP IN THE PARK WONDER WHERE JILL WAS JILL BAYNE FAYNE
WHAT HE STAMMERED DO YOU MEAN TO KEEP THAT MONEY EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME BUT I OWE THIS MONEY TO THE CHARITY FUND A DEPOSIT WHICH I PROMISED TO PAY THIS MORNING OH WELL THEN SAID MONTE CRISTO
THERE IS STILL A SUM OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS OH A MERE NOTHING SAID MONTE CRISTO THE BALANCE WOULD COME TO ABOUT THAT SUM BUT KEEP IT AND WE SHALL BE QUITS COUNT SAID DANGLARS ARE YOU SPEAKING SERIOUSLY
THEY ARE GONE TO SEEK A VERY STRICT CONVENT IN ITALY OR SPAIN
BUT MY DEARS BOTH OF YOU BILLY HAD AT LAST SAID TO THEM JUST LISTEN WE SHALL HAVE
AND THEN THE THIRD AND AS I SAW THE HOPE OF BARSOOM CRAWLING
I AM GLAD DIANA IS SO HAPPY AND SATISFIED BUT WHEN MY TURN COMES IF IT EVER DOES I DO HOPE THERE'LL BE SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE THRILLING ABOUT IT BUT THEN DIANA THOUGHT SO TOO ONCE
IF IT ISN'T METHUSELAH JOHN WHAT IS IT THEN BUT ALICE GREGGORY SHOOK HER HEAD SHE TOO IT SEEMED COULD BE FIRM ON OCCASION AND THOUGH SHE SMILED BRIGHTLY ALL SHE WOULD SAY WAS IF HE HASN'T TOLD YOU I SHA'N'T YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO HIM
POETRY AND PROSE FOR THE NEXT MONTH ANNE LIVED IN WHAT FOR AVONLEA MIGHT BE CALLED A WHIRL OF EXCITEMENT THE PREPARATION OF HER OWN MODEST OUTFIT FOR REDMOND WAS OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE
THERE WAS ABSOLUTE SILENCE FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN A YOUNG NOBLE AROSE
OR FAR WORSE STILL WITH OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN IT
MISS LAVENDAR WAS GETTING READY TO BE MARRIED AND THE STONE HOUSE WAS THE SCENE OF ENDLESS CONSULTATIONS AND PLANNINGS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH CHARLOTTA THE FOURTH HOVERING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THINGS IN AGITATED DELIGHT AND WONDER THEN THE DRESSMAKER CAME
BILLY LAUGHED BUT SHE FROWNED TOO I KNOW DEAR I DON'T LIKE THAT PART I WISH THEY WOULD LET ME ALONE WHEN I'M WITH YOU BUT AS FOR THE OPERETTA IT IS REALLY A GOOD THING DEAR AND YOU'LL SAY SO WHEN YOU SEE IT
HE DID NOT WAIT TO QUESTION BUT IN AN INSTANT A GUARD WAS RACING TO THE NEAREST DOCK AND THOUGH THE AIR WAS THIN AND ALMOST GONE AT THE ROOFTOP THEY MANAGED TO LAUNCH THE FASTEST ONE MAN AIR SCOUT MACHINE THAT THE SKILL OF BARSOOM HAD EVER PRODUCED
THE TALL SLENDER KIND BUT SOMEHOW I WOULDN'T WANT FRED TO BE TALL AND SLENDER BECAUSE DON'T YOU SEE HE WOULDN'T BE FRED THEN OF COURSE ADDED DIANA RATHER DOLEFULLY WE WILL BE A DREADFULLY PUDGY COUPLE
I WAS TOO WEAK AFTER IT I CRIED TO MY COMPANION AND IF YOU REACH THE PUMP ROOM TURN LOOSE ALL THE PUMPS IT IS THE ONLY CHANCE BARSOOM HAS TO EXIST TOMORROW FROM WHERE I LAY I OPENED THE SECOND DOOR
SHE GASPED OH IT DOES SEEM SO SO SO HOPELESSLY GROWN UP ANNE OF LATE HAD NOT BEEN WITHOUT HER SUSPICIONS THAT DIANA WAS PROVING FALSE TO THE MELANCHOLY BYRONIC HERO OF HER EARLY DREAMS
AND FULFILL OUR HOPES IN THE DISTANCE WE SAW THE BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT OF AN APPROACHING AIRSHIP BUT WE ATTACHED NO SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO SO COMMON A SIGHT LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING IT RACED TOWARD HELIUM UNTIL ITS VERY SPEED
MY DEAR YOU TUMBLE MY GOWN WAS MISSUS ALLEN'S REPLY HER ASSURANCE HOWEVER STANDING SOLE AS IT DID WAS NOT THROWN AWAY IT BROUGHT A MORE CORDIAL MORE NATURAL SMILE INTO HIS COUNTENANCE
PERHAPS YOU DID NOT KNOW I HAD BEEN THERE I WAS NOT WITHIN AT THE TIME BUT I HEARD OF IT FROM ELEANOR AND SHE HAS BEEN WISHING EVER SINCE TO SEE YOU TO EXPLAIN THE REASON OF SUCH INCIVILITY BUT PERHAPS I CAN DO IT AS WELL IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT MY FATHER
UNCLE ROGER UNLOCKED AND FLUNG OPEN THE FRONT DOOR AS HE DID SO CLEAR AND SWEET RANG OUT TEN BELL LIKE CHIMES
I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
TILL A NEW OBJECT SUDDENLY ENGAGED HER ATTENTION SHE WAS SITTING BY EDWARD AND IN TAKING HIS TEA FROM MISSUS DASHWOOD HIS HAND PASSED SO DIRECTLY BEFORE HER AS TO MAKE A RING WITH A PLAIT OF HAIR IN THE CENTRE VERY CONSPICUOUS ON ONE OF HIS FINGERS
THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF COMFORT IN THIS WE WERE ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF PEG BOWEN AS WE WOULD BE OF ANY SPECTRAL VISITANT PETER SCOFFED AT THE IDEA PEG BOWEN WASN'T IN THE HOUSE BEFORE YOUR UNCLE ROGER LOCKED IT UP AND HOW COULD SHE GET IN AFTERWARDS HE SAID
AND I GOT BACK ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO I SET DOWN ON THE FRONT DOOR STEPS FOR A MOMENT AND ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A BELL RING IN THE HOUSE EIGHT TIMES I TELL YOU I WAS SKEERED I MADE A BOLT FOR THE ORCHARD AND YOU WON'T CATCH ME GOING NEAR THAT HOUSE TILL YOUR UNCLE ROGER COMES HOME
AND MISSUS ALLEN'S WAVERING CONVICTIONS ONLY MADE IT MORE DOUBTFUL TO MILSOM STREET SHE WAS DIRECTED AND HAVING MADE HERSELF PERFECT IN THE NUMBER HASTENED AWAY WITH EAGER STEPS AND A BEATING HEART TO PAY HER VISIT EXPLAIN HER CONDUCT AND BE FORGIVEN
ON THE PRESENT OCCASION FOR THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR VISITOR TOWARDS WHOSE AMUSEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE HE WISHED TO ENGAGE THEM FOR BOTH YOU MUST DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT SAID HE
FOR SHE SOON RECOLLECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY EXCUSE FOR STAYING AT HOME AND IN THE SECOND
SHE WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR HOWEVER TO REGARD IT AS AN AFFRONT AND AFFECTING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT PASSED BY INSTANTLY TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE SHE INTERNALLY RESOLVED HENCEFORWARD TO CATCH EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF EYEING THE HAIR AND OF SATISFYING HERSELF BEYOND ALL DOUBT
WHO PLEDGED ALL COMERS IN A GOLDEN CUP WITH JEWELS BRIGHT AND IF YOU DRANK OF THE CUP WITH HER SAID THE STORY GIRL HER EYES GLOWING THROUGH THE EMERALD DUSK ABOUT US YOU WERE NEVER SEEN IN THE WORLD AGAIN YOU WERE WHISKED STRAIGHTWAY TO FAIRYLAND AND LIVED THERE WITH A FAIRY BRIDE
AND AS SHE RETIRED DOWN THE STREET COULD NOT WITHHOLD ONE GLANCE AT THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOWS IN EXPECTATION OF SEEING HER THERE
WHILE CECILY ADMITTED THAT WILLY FRASER HAD WRITTEN ON HIS SLATE AND SHOWED IT TO HER IF YOU LOVE ME AS I LOVE YOU NO KNIFE CAN CUT OUR LOVE IN TWO BUT SARA RAY NEVER YOU BREATHE THIS TO A LIVING SOUL
FOR SHE ALWAYS CAREFULLY PLACED THESE COMBINGS IN THE LITTLE BLUE VASE ON THE MANTEL TO BE SOME DAY FORMED INTO THE COVETED FEMININE RAT HANGING CONSPICUOUSLY TO THE GAS JET BY A STRING WAS A FOLDED PAPER
TO THE EXQUISITE CONGRUITY BETWEEN MILLY AND CYPHER'S THERE IS A CERTAIN FATE HANGING OVER MILLY SAID KRAFT AND IF IT OVERTAKES HER SHE IS LOST TO CYPHER'S AND TO US SHE WILL GROW FAT
WHICH COULD NOT BE WORN WHILE DRIVING EXCEPT BY A PERSONAGE AT HIS SIDE SAT THE LADY OF REMSEN'S HEART THE LADY WHO LOOKED LIKE POMEGRANATE BLOSSOMS AND THE GIBBOUS MOON REMSEN MET THEM COMING
NOW WHERE ARE YOU GOING I'D LIKE TO KNOW JOHN PERKINS
THE TWO RODE SIDE BY SIDE DURING THE FAMOUS MOOTED UP HILL CHARGE THAT WAS DISPUTED SO HOTLY AT THE TIME BY THE SPANIARDS AND AFTERWARD BY THE DEMOCRATS AFTER THE WAR REMSEN CAME BACK TO HIS POLO AND SHAD
OF LATE SUCH HAD BEEN JOHN PERKINS'S HABIT AT TEN OR ELEVEN HE WOULD RETURN SOMETIMES KATY WOULD BE ASLEEP SOMETIMES WAITING UP
THEN SAID I WHEN YOU LED US AGAINST THE LUMBERMAN THE KLONDIKER IT WASN'T ALTOGETHER ON ACCOUNT OF THE UNERRING ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE WELL
ALONG THE DRIVEWAY IN THE EARLY MORNING SPUN A VICTORIA DRAWN BY A PAIR OF FIERY BAYS THERE WAS SOMETHING FOREIGN ABOUT THE AFFAIR
IT STILL RETAINED SOMETHING OF HER CONTOUR MIDWAY OF THE SLEEVES WERE FINE INDIVIDUAL WRINKLES MADE BY THE MOVEMENTS OF HER ARMS IN WORKING FOR HIS COMFORT AND PLEASURE A DELICATE BUT IMPELLING ODOR OF BLUEBELLS CAME FROM IT
JOHN SAT AT A FRONT WINDOW HE DID NOT CARE TO SMOKE OUTSIDE THE CITY ROARED TO HIM TO COME JOIN IN ITS DANCE OF FOLLY AND PLEASURE THE NIGHT WAS HIS
HAD BEEN SHARPLY STIRRED BY THE LOSS OF HER PRESENCE HAS IT NOT BEEN DINNED INTO US BY PROVERB AND SERMON AND FABLE THAT WE NEVER PRIZE THE MUSIC TILL THE SWEET VOICED BIRD HAS FLOWN
SLOWLY BECAUSE IN THE LEXICON OF HIS DAILY LIFE THERE WAS NO SUCH WORD AS PERHAPS THERE ARE NO SURPRISES AWAITING A MAN WHO HAS BEEN MARRIED TWO YEARS AND LIVES IN A FLAT AS HE WALKED

IN THEOLOGY THE STATE OF A LUCKLESS MORTAL PRENATALLY DAMNED THE DOCTRINE OF REPROBATION WAS TAUGHT BY CALVIN WHOSE JOY IN IT WAS SOMEWHAT MARRED BY THE SAD SINCERITY OF HIS CONVICTION
AND THIS IS STILL SOMETIMES AFFIRMED IN PARTIBUS INFIDELIUM
A THING THAT MOSTLY SATISFIES REFORMERS OPPOSED TO REFORMATION REFUGE
REPLIED HIS HEAD AT LEAST APPEARS EXCESSIVE
DENIAL OF SOMETHING DESIRED AS AN ELDERLY MAIDEN'S HAND IN MARRIAGE TO A RICH AND HANDSOME SUITOR A VALUABLE FRANCHISE TO A RICH CORPORATION BY AN ALDERMAN
A RELIGIOUS OR SEMI RELIGIOUS CEREMONY FIXED BY LAW PRECEPT OR CUSTOM
BY THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY ANY BREAK IN THE CONTINUITY OF A DISAGREEABLE EXPECTATION ALTGELD UPON HIS INCANDESCENT BED LAY AN ATTENDANT DEMON AT HIS HEAD
THE DEVIL SAID D'ARTAGNAN
BUT I WILL NOT SWEAR TO IT SIRE YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH AND UNLESS A MAN BE ENDOWED WITH THAT ADMIRABLE INSTINCT
EVERYONE TO RETURN HOME AND WAIT FOR NEWS
HE HOPED TO INTIMIDATE BUT D'ARTAGNAN HAD ON THE PRECEDING DAY SERVED HIS APPRENTICESHIP FRESH SHARPENED BY HIS VICTORY FULL OF HOPES OF FUTURE FAVOR HE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO RECOIL A STEP SO THE TWO SWORDS WERE CROSSED CLOSE TO THE HILTS
SHALL I GIVE YOU COUNSEL GOOD COUNSEL THE COUNSEL OF A FRIEND
PASSED SO CLOSE TO D'ARTAGNAN'S FACE
WHILE READING THIS LETTER D'ARTAGNAN FELT HIS HEART DILATED AND COMPRESSED BY THAT DELICIOUS SPASM WHICH TORTURES AND CARESSES THE HEARTS OF LOVERS IT WAS THE FIRST BILLET HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM
PERHAPS THERE IS BUT ONE AT THIS MOMENT BUT BY THIS EVENING THERE WILL BE FOUR IT APPEARS THAT OUR JOURNEY WAS A REMOUNTING JOURNEY THEN EXACTLY SO SAID D'ARTAGNAN AND NODDING TO PLANCHET HE WENT OUT
TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS TO THE RESCUE
THEN UPON SEEING MY MUSKETEERS THEY CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND FORGOT THEIR PRIVATE HATRED FOR PARTISAN HATRED FOR YOUR MAJESTY CANNOT BE IGNORANT THAT THE MUSKETEERS WHO BELONG TO THE KING AND NOBODY BUT THE KING
WITH A LETTER IN WHICH HE BEGGED OF HIM TO EJECT THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN FROM HIS HOUSE AND TO REPRIMAND HIS PEOPLE FOR THEIR AUDACITY IN MAKING SORTIE AGAINST THE KING'S MUSKETEERS
HEAVED A PROFOUND SIGH AND SET TO WORK TO GROOM THE THIRD HORSE
HIS VISIT OF THE DAY BEFORE IT IS TO BE REMEMBERED HAD BEEN VERY SHORT AND VERY LITTLE EXPLICATIVE HE FOUND TREVILLE IN A JOYFUL MOOD HE HAD THOUGHT THE KING AND QUEEN CHARMING AT THE BALL IT IS TRUE THE CARDINAL HAD BEEN PARTICULARLY ILL TEMPERED
AND ALTHOUGH IGNORANT OF THE GAME WHICH HE HAD NEVER PLAYED HE ACCEPTED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIS TIME FROM NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AS IT THEN SCARCELY WAS TILL TWELVE THE TWO MUSKETEERS WERE ALREADY THERE AND WERE PLAYING TOGETHER
THE TRIUMPH OF THE QUEEN AND THE HUMILIATION OF HIS EMINENCE YOU MUST LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF WHAT HAVE I TO FEAR REPLIED D'ARTAGNAN AS LONG AS I SHALL HAVE THE LUCK TO ENJOY THE FAVOR OF THEIR MAJESTIES EVERYTHING BELIEVE ME
PLACING HIS HAND UPON HIS HIP SIRE RESUMED TREVILLE AS I TOLD YOU
NOT TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL I AM ABOUT TO MAKE TO YOU
THE DEVIL WHAT MUST I DO ABOVE ALL THINGS BE ALWAYS ON YOUR GUARD THE CARDINAL HAS A TENACIOUS MEMORY AND A LONG ARM YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT HE WILL REPAY YOU BY SOME ILL TURN BUT OF WHAT SORT
SHOULD THE FAVORED ONE BE OPENLY CONVICTED THAT ALTERS NOT ONE WHIT HIS STATUE WITH THE GIRL FOR A GIRL HAVING GIVEN HER HEART NEVER RECALLS IT NOT WHOLLY SHE MAY REGRET SHE NEVER RECOILS IN OTHER WORDS
ALL WHITE WITH BLOSSOM AND THE CHILD BEGAN SINGING AS SHE WENT SHE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD WHY BUT I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE THE BEAUTIFUL WORLD MADE HER FEEL GLAD THE PATH WOUND ALONG THROUGH THE TREES AND AS IT GREW WIDER AFTER TURNING A CORNER
IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS HAND BUT BUT FEW THINGS MYSTIFY POOR LAW ABIDING MAN THAN THIS THAT THE CENTRAL THE PROFOUNDEST THE MOST PORTENTOUS PUZZLE OF THE UNIVERSE THE WEAL OF WOE OF TWO HIGH ASPIRING
AND TO FLAUNT HIS MAGNIFICENT FAN TAIL IN THE SUNSHINE THE JAYS WITH PEACOCKS FEATHERS ARE THE SNOBS OF THIS WORLD AND NEVER SINCE THE DAYS OF AESOP WERE THEY MORE NUMEROUS IN ANY LAND
AND EASY AND FRIENDLY WERE THEY BROUGHT TOGETHER IN A NATURAL UNPRETENTIOUS WAY AND BUT FOR AN UNHAPPY PASSION FOR PEACOCKS FEATHERS IN ENGLAND GENTLE SHADES OF MARAT AND ROBESPIERRE
WHEN SHE CROSSED THE LAST MEADOW FROM THE MILL
TO BE WOOED AND WEDDED IS THE LAW OF HER BEING YET NOT FOR ONE MOMENT DARES SHE TO EXHIBIT TOO GREAT AN ALACRITY TO OBEY THAT LAW FOR SHE KNOWS INSTINCTIVELY THAT AN EASY VICTORY PROGNOSTICATES A FICKLE VICTOR
BUT THIS IS A THORNY SUBJECT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT ALL MEN LOVE ALL GIRLS THE MAID OF SWEET SIXTEEN EQUALLY WITH THE MAID OF UNTOLD AGE THERE IS SOMETHING EXASPERATINGLY SOMETHING OR OTHERISH ABOUT GIRLS AND THEY KNOW IT
OFTEN ENOUGH A PREPOSTEROUS ASSUMPTION WITH IT SHE IS LOOKED UPON TOO MUCH AND ALWAYS ALWAYS A GIRL HAS TO PRETEND THAT NEVER DID SHE DESCEND TO DISSEMBLANCE
SAD NEWS SAD NEWS SAID THE ABBOT AND THEN HE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED CHEER UP CHEER UP GOOD MASTER SAID THE SHEPHERD HAVE YOU NEVER YET HEARD
THAT A FOOL MAY TEACH A WISE MAN WIT I THINK I CAN HELP YOU OUT OF YOUR TROUBLE YOU HELP ME CRIED THE ABBOT HOW HOW WELL ANSWERED THE SHEPHERD YOU KNOW THAT EVERYBODY SAYS
FOR WHERE TWO CROSS PATHS DIVIDED THERE SAT A BIG GRAY WOLF LICKING HIS LONG PAWS AND LOOKING SHARPLY ABOUT HIM AND GOOD MORNING RED RIDING HOOD SAID HE GOOD MORNING MISTER WOLF SHE ANSWERED
AND I HAVE COME TO BEG YOUR PARDON FOR HIM AND FOR ME AND WITH THAT HE THREW OFF HIS LONG GOWN THE KING LAUGHED LOUD AND LONG A MERRY FELLOW YOU ARE SAID HE
MANY GIRLS WOULD LIKE TO BE MEN EXCEPT ON OCCASIONS AT LEAST SO THEY SAY BUT PERHAPS THIS IS JUST A PART OF THEIR SOMETHING OR OTHERISHNESS WHY THEY SHOULD WANT TO BE MEN MEN CANNOT CONCEIVE MEN PALE BEFORE THEM
I GLIMPSED HIM JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE DOORWAY AND THE SIGHT OF HIM NOW ROARING AS HE PERCEIVED HIS LIFELESS FELLOW STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS RAGE FILLED ME I MUST CONFESS
THE THARKS WERE HAVING THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
WITH EMPHASIS AND DIGNITY IF AT ALL ROARED DAK KOVA BY THE DEAD HANDS AT MY THROAT BUT HE SHALL DIE BAR COMAS NO MAUDLIN WEAKNESS ON YOUR PART SHALL SAVE HIM
SPRINGING THE PADLOCK FAST AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
HIS GREAT EYES FASTENED UPON ME IN WHAT SEEMED A PITIFUL APPEAL FOR PROTECTION I COULD NOT WITHSTAND THAT LOOK NOR COULD I ON SECOND THOUGHT HAVE DESERTED MY RESCUER WITHOUT GIVING AS GOOD AN ACCOUNT OF MYSELF IN HIS BEHALF
MY BEAST HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN HIS FIRST HOLD HAVING SUNK HIS MIGHTY FANGS FAR INTO THE BREAST OF HIS ADVERSARY BUT THE GREAT ARMS AND PAWS OF THE APE
WAS THE OBJECT OF THE FIERCE AND JEALOUS HATRED OF HIS OLD LIEUTENANT DAK KOVA THE JED WHO HAD CAPTURED ME AND I COULD NOT BUT NOTE THE ALMOST STUDIED EFFORTS WHICH THE LATTER MADE TO AFFRONT HIS SUPERIOR
SO WITH THE CUNNING OF A MADMAN I BACKED INTO THE FAR CORNER OF MY CELL WHEN NEXT I HEARD HIM APPROACHING
TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
WITH ARMS WIDE STRETCHED TO EASE HIS FALL AGAIN AS ON THE PRECEDING DAY I HAD RECOURSE TO EARTHLY TACTICS AND SWINGING MY RIGHT FIST FULL UPON THE POINT OF HIS CHIN
AND BENDING OVER ME WAS AN ANCIENT AND UGLY FEMALE AS I OPENED MY EYES SHE TURNED TO ONE OF THE WARRIORS SAYING HE WILL LIVE O JED TIS WELL REPLIED THE ONE SO ADDRESSED
WITH DIRE FOREBODINGS I AM EVER WILLING TO STAND AND FIGHT WHEN THE ODDS ARE NOT TOO OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST ME BUT IN THIS INSTANCE I PERCEIVED NEITHER GLORY NOR PROFIT
AGAIN WHAT COULD HE DO BY WAY OF EARNING A LIVING HE DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE CITY AND ITS WAYS BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT SUMMARY DISMISSAL FROM A BANK IS NOT THE BEST RECOMMENDATION ONE CAN PUT FORWARD IN APPLYING FOR ANOTHER JOB
WHY HE SAID IT WAS A FORGERY MUTTERED MISTER WALLER SITTING DOWN HEAVILY MIKE COULD NOT TAKE IT IN ALL AT ONCE HE WAS STUNNED
LET US AS YOU SAY SCUD FORTH WE WILL GO TO A MECCA WHY SO CALLED I DO NOT KNOW NOR INDEED DO I EVER HOPE TO KNOW THERE WE MAY OBTAIN AT A PRICE A PASSABLE CUP OF COFFEE AND YOU SHALL TELL ME YOUR PAINFUL STORY
THAN TO ANY SENSE OF SHAME AT HER ELOPING AND LIVING WITH WICKHAM A FORTNIGHT BEFORE THEY TOOK PLACE
HE RECOLLECTED THE MAN WHO HAD PRESENTED IT A TALLISH MAN WITH A BEARD
WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TURMOIL I COULDN'T WAIT TO HEAR I WAS TOO JOLLY GLAD TO GET AWAY OLD BICK LOOKED AT ME AS IF HE COULD EAT ME
AND TO REALIZE THAT HIS BLUNT SPEECH WAS LARGELY DUE TO SHYNESS IN SPITE OF HIS PREJUDICE AGAINST EDWARD
AND CENTRED AND SANDY TURNBULL HEADED A BEAUTIFUL GOAL
MIKE WISHED HIM LUCK AND THERE WAS RAYMOND WHO DABBLED IN JOURNALISM AND WAS THE AUTHOR OF STRAIGHT TALKS TO HOUSEWIVES IN TRIFLES UNDER THE PSEUDONYM OF LADY GUSSIE WRAGGE
THERE WAS A CURIOUSLY GREY TIRED LOOK ON HIS FACE MIKE COULD NOT MAKE IT OUT
OR RATHER BEING APPARENTLY CERTAIN TO END SATISFACTORILY FOR THE INVALID THOUGH OUT OF DANGER WAS STILL IN BED
IS REASSURING I MAY NOW THINK OF MY OWN TROUBLES COMRADE BRISTOW HAS BLOWN INTO THE OFFICE TODAY IN PATENT LEATHER BOOTS WITH WHITE KID UPPERS AS I BELIEVE THE TECHNICAL TERM IS ADD TO THAT THE FACT THAT HE IS STILL WEARING THE SATIN TIE THE WAISTCOAT AND THE RING
AS SOON AS HE SHOULD BE OF AGE AND THE WIDOW AND YOUNGER CHILDREN WOULD BY THAT MEANS BE PROVIDED FOR
PSMITH MAKES INQUIRIES PSMITH AS WAS HIS HABIT OF A MORNING WHEN THE FIERCE RUSH OF HIS COMMERCIAL DUTIES HAD ABATED SOMEWHAT WAS LEANING GRACEFULLY AGAINST HIS DESK
I PROMISED THEM SO FAITHFULLY WHAT WILL WICKHAM SAY IT WAS TO BE SUCH A SECRET IF IT WAS TO BE SECRET SAID JANE SAY NOT ANOTHER WORD ON THE SUBJECT YOU MAY DEPEND UPON MY SEEKING NO FURTHER OH CERTAINLY SAID ELIZABETH
HAD NOT HAD TO STAND THE TEST OF SUNSHINE AT PRESENT THE WEATHER BEING COLD AND DISMAL HE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY CONTENTED NOW THAT HE HAD GOT INTO THE SWING OF HIS WORK THE DAYS PASSED VERY QUICKLY AND WITH HIS LIFE AFTER OFFICE HOURS HE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND AT ALL
AND SOON DINING AT LONGBOURN AND THE CONCLUSION OF ALL WAS THE COMFORTABLE DECLARATION THAT THOUGH HE HAD BEEN INVITED ONLY TO A FAMILY DINNER SHE WOULD TAKE CARE TO HAVE TWO FULL COURSES
MISTER COLLINS MEANWHILE WAS MEDITATING IN SOLITUDE ON WHAT HAD PASSED HE THOUGHT TOO WELL OF HIMSELF TO COMPREHEND ON WHAT MOTIVES HIS COUSIN COULD REFUSE HIM AND THOUGH HIS PRIDE WAS HURT
FOR HE WAS LONGING TO PUBLISH HIS PROSPEROUS LOVE AS HE WAS TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TOO EARLY ON THE MORROW TO SEE ANY OF THE FAMILY THE CEREMONY OF LEAVE TAKING WAS PERFORMED WHEN THE LADIES MOVED FOR THE NIGHT
FROM THIS DAY YOU MUST BE A STRANGER TO ONE OF YOUR PARENTS YOUR MOTHER WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO NOT MARRY MISTER COLLINS AND I WILL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN IF YOU DO
WHEN I CALL CHARLES MOST CAPABLE OF ENGAGING ANY WOMAN'S HEART WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO FAVOUR AN ATTACHMENT AND NOTHING TO PREVENT IT AM I WRONG MY DEAREST JANE
THAT WHEN CALLED INTO ACTION SHE WOULD HAVE SACRIFICED EVERY BETTER FEELING TO WORLDLY ADVANTAGE CHARLOTTE THE WIFE OF MISTER COLLINS WAS A MOST HUMILIATING PICTURE
I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN TALKING TO UNDUTIFUL CHILDREN
SHE ADDED IN A MELANCHOLY TONE
I WILL HAVE NO RESERVES FROM YOU
YOUR MOTHER INSISTS UPON YOUR ACCEPTING IT IS IT NOT SO MISSUS BENNET YES OR I WILL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN AN UNHAPPY ALTERNATIVE IS BEFORE YOU ELIZABETH
MY DEAR MADAM REPLIED HE LET US BE FOR EVER SILENT ON THIS POINT FAR BE IT FROM ME HE PRESENTLY CONTINUED
DETAINED FIRST BY THE CIVILITY OF MISTER COLLINS WHOSE INQUIRIES AFTER HERSELF AND ALL HER FAMILY WERE VERY MINUTE AND THEN BY A LITTLE CURIOSITY SATISFIED HERSELF WITH WALKING TO THE WINDOW AND PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR
CAROLINE DECIDEDLY SAYS THAT NONE OF THE PARTY WILL RETURN INTO HERTFORDSHIRE THIS WINTER I WILL READ IT TO YOU WHEN MY BROTHER LEFT US YESTERDAY
AND CHANCING TO WALK NEAR THE COURSE THROUGH WHICH IT PASSED HAS FELT POWERFULLY IN THE SILENCE AND DESERTION OF THE STREETS AND IN THE STAGNATION OF ORDINARY BUSINESS THE DEEP INTEREST WHICH AT THAT MOMENT WAS POSSESSING THE HEART OF MAN
DOLOKHOV CLIMBED CAREFULLY AND SLOWLY THROUGH THE WINDOW AND LOWERED HIS LEGS PRESSING AGAINST BOTH SIDES OF THE WINDOW HE ADJUSTED HIMSELF ON HIS SEAT
AT PRESENT SO GENERAL BY WHICH INSTEAD OF TAKING IT IN ITS PROPER SENSE AS THE ACT OF REPRODUCING IN OUR MINDS THE FEELINGS OF ANOTHER WHETHER FOR HATRED INDIGNATION LOVE PITY OR APPROBATION
OR SOMETHING SO EXTRAORDINARY MAY HAPPEN TO ONE THAT HONOR AND DISHONOR WILL BE ALL THE SAME PIERRE OFTEN INDULGED IN REFLECTIONS OF THIS SORT NULLIFYING ALL HIS DECISIONS AND INTENTIONS HE WENT TO KURAGIN'S
FROM MY BOYISH DAYS I HAD ALWAYS FELT A GREAT PERPLEXITY ON ONE POINT IN MACBETH IT WAS THIS THE KNOCKING AT THE GATE WHICH SUCCEEDS TO THE MURDER OF DUNCAN
HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE HAS SEEN
EXHIBITS HUMAN NATURE IN ITS MOST ABJECT AND HUMILIATING ATTITUDE SUCH AN ATTITUDE WOULD LITTLE SUIT THE PURPOSES OF THE POET WHAT THEN MUST HE DO HE MUST THROW THE INTEREST ON THE MURDERER
DIFFERENT IN DEGREE AMONGST ALL LIVING CREATURES THIS INSTINCT THEREFORE BECAUSE IT ANNIHILATES ALL DISTINCTIONS AND DEGRADES THE GREATEST OF MEN TO THE LEVEL OF THE POOR BEETLE THAT WE TREAD ON
NO I WON'T SAID PIERRE PUSHING ANATOLE ASIDE AND HE WENT UP TO THE WINDOW DOLOKHOV WAS HOLDING THE ENGLISHMAN'S HAND AND CLEARLY AND DISTINCTLY REPEATING THE TERMS OF THE BET ADDRESSING HIMSELF PARTICULARLY TO ANATOLE AND PIERRE
I HAVE HEARD HER LECTURE TEDDY ASHBURNHAM BY THE HOUR ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FRANZ HALS AND A WOUVERMANS AND WHY THE PRE MYCENAEAN STATUES WERE CUBICAL WITH KNOBS ON THE TOP I WONDER WHAT HE MADE OF IT PERHAPS HE WAS THANKFUL
THE MORE HE FELT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF GOING TO SLEEP ON SUCH A NIGHT
SOBER RING CRIED FROM THE WINDOW COME HERE PART THE BETS THIS WAS DOLOKHOV AN OFFICER OF THE SEMENOV REGIMENT A NOTORIOUS GAMBLER AND DUELIST WHO WAS LIVING WITH ANATOLE PIERRE SMILED LOOKING ABOUT HIM MERRILY
BUT IN THE MURDERER SUCH A MURDERER AS A POET WILL CONDESCEND TO THERE MUST BE RAGING SOME GREAT STORM OF PASSION JEALOUSY AMBITION VENGEANCE HATRED
UNTIL THEY DREW UP BESIDE THE PALACE STEPS AN AGED WINKIE DRESSED IN A UNIFORM OF SILVER CLOTH CAME FORWARD TO ASSIST THEM TO ALIGHT SAID THE SCARECROW TO HIS PERSONAGE SHOW US AT ONCE TO YOUR MASTER THE EMPEROR
THE SCHOLARS FOLLOWED AFTER HIM IN A WILD MOB AND I WAS LEFT ALONE IN THE SCHOOL ROOM STILL IN A HIGHLY MAGNIFIED STATE AND FREE TO DO AS I PLEASED IT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO ME
WHY NOT USE ONE OF HIS LEGS TO MAKE A LEG FOR THE HORSE THAT CARRIES HIM I JUDGE THAT BOTH ARE MADE OF WOOD NOW THAT IS WHAT I CALL REAL CLEVERNESS SAID THE SCARECROW APPROVINGLY I WONDER MY BRAINS DID NOT THINK OF THAT LONG AGO
HAS LATELY CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE NICKEL PLATED GOOD GRACIOUS THE SCARECROW EXCLAIMED AT HEARING THIS IF HIS WIT BEARS THE SAME POLISH HOW SPARKLING IT MUST BE BUT SHOW US IN
SAID HE I HAVE CAPTURED A WOGGLE BUG A VERY RARE AND INTERESTING SPECIMEN DO ANY OF YOU KNOW WHAT A WOGGLE BUG IS NO YELLED THE SCHOLARS IN CHORUS THEN SAID THE PROFESSOR
THERE REMAINED SO LITTLE SPACE FOR THE KING THAT HE WAS LIABLE TO FALL OFF AS SOON AS THE HORSE STARTED FETCH A CLOTHESLINE SAID THE KING TO HIS ARMY AND TIE US ALL TOGETHER
BUT PARDON ME IF I SEEM INQUISITIVE
NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR WAS THE REPLY ALTHOUGH IT IS MY INTENTION SOON TO VISIT THE EMERALD CITY
AS COOLLY AS IF NO DANGER THREATENED HIS THRONE BUT THE PUMPKINHEAD HAVING CAUGHT SIGHT OF TIP AMBLED TOWARD THE BOY AS FAST AS HIS WOODEN LEGS WOULD GO GOOD AFTERNOON NOBLE PARENT HE CRIED DELIGHTEDLY
AND I ACQUIRED IN THIS WAY A FUND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT I WILL MYSELF CONFESS IS SIMPLY MARVELOUS THAT IS WHY I PLACE T E THOROUGHLY EDUCATED UPON MY CARDS
THEN AT ONCE THE PAIN STOPPED AND THE BOY ROSE TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND FOUND THE SCARECROW LOOKING WITH AMAZEMENT AT THE END OF THE PEPPER BOX WHAT'S HAPPENED ASKED THE BOY A LITTLE ASHAMED OF HIS RECENT EXHIBITION
ARE LIABLE TO LIVE FOR MANY YEARS MY LIFE IS NECESSARILY SHORT SO I MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FEW DAYS THAT REMAIN TO ME THERE THERE DON'T WORRY ANSWERED THE SCARECROW SOOTHINGLY
DON'T MENTION THAT TO THE TIN WOODMAN EXCLAIMED THE SCARECROW EARNESTLY YOU WOULD HURT HIS FEELINGS TERRIBLY HE IS A PROUD MAN AS HE HAS EVERY REASON TO BE AND IT PLEASES HIM TO BE TERMED EMPEROR RATHER THAN KING
I WAS PROUD OF MY GREAT SIZE AND REALIZED THAT NOW I COULD SAFELY TRAVEL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHILE MY SUPERIOR CULTURE WOULD MAKE ME A FIT ASSOCIATE FOR THE MOST LEARNED PERSON I MIGHT CHANCE TO MEET SO WHILE THE PROFESSOR PICKED THE LITTLE GIRLS
A SPIRIT AS FIERCE AND DETERMINED AS HIS OWN AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT
ONE OF THESE WAS ROGER PALMER EARL OF CASTELMAINE IN IRELAND AND HUSBAND OF THE DUCHESS OF CLEVELAND HIS TITLE HAD NOTORIOUSLY BEEN PURCHASED BY HIS WIFE'S DISHONOUR AND HIS OWN HIS FORTUNE WAS SMALL HIS TEMPER
DISCUSSING LITERARY QUESTIONS WITH WALLER AND SAINT EVREMOND AND CORRESPONDING WITH LA FONTAINE TO ACQUIRE A CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH POLITICS
AND WHO HAD BEEN REWARDED FOR HIS SERVICES WITH THE TITLE
TWO BILLS OF INDICTMENT AGAINST HIM FOR PERJURY HAD BEEN FOUND BY THE GRAND JURY OF MIDDLESEX A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE DEATH OF CHARLES SOON AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE ELECTIONS THE TRIAL CAME ON AMONG THE UPPER AND MIDDLE CLASSES
REPRESENTED FRANCE AND WHO TO VIRTUES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS EMINENTLY FRENCH JOINED IN LARGE MEASURE THAT UNQUIET UNSCRUPULOUS AND VAINGLORIOUS AMBITION WHICH HAS REPEATEDLY DRAWN ON FRANCE THE RESENTMENT OF EUROPE
UNDERTOOK TO FURNISH THEY AGREED TO DESCRIBE THE POOR YOUNG LADY AS A CREATURE WITHOUT VIRTUE SHAME OR DELICACY AND MADE UP LONG ROMANCES ABOUT TENDER INTERVIEWS AND STOLEN FAVOURS
AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO OBTAIN THE QUEEN'S INTERCESSION BUT SHE INDIGNANTLY REFUSED TO SAY A WORD IN FAVOUR OF SUCH A WRETCH AFTER AN INTERVAL OF ONLY FORTY EIGHT HOURS OATES WAS AGAIN BROUGHT OUT OF HIS DUNGEON HE WAS UNABLE TO STAND
WESTMINSTER HALL WAS CROWDED WITH SPECTATORS AMONG WHOM WERE MANY ROMAN CATHOLICS
WHEN HE WAS UNBOUND IT SEEMED THAT HE HAD BORNE AS MUCH AS THE HUMAN FRAME CAN BEAR WITHOUT DISSOLUTION JAMES WAS ENTREATED TO REMIT THE SECOND FLOGGING HIS ANSWER WAS SHORT AND CLEAR HE SHALL GO THROUGH WITH IT IF HE HAS BREATH IN HIS BODY
AND TO CREATE ANOTHER HOLLAND IN COUNTRIES BEYOND THE REACH OF THE TYRANNY OF FRANCE NO OBSTACLE WOULD THEN REMAIN TO CHECK THE PROGRESS OF THE HOUSE OF BOURBON A FEW YEARS AND THAT HOUSE MIGHT ADD TO ITS DOMINIONS
WAS TO WALLACE RELIGION GAVE HER SANCTION TO THAT INTENSE AND UNQUENCHABLE ANIMOSITY HUNDREDS OF CALVINISTIC PREACHERS PROCLAIMED THAT THE SAME POWER WHICH HAD SET APART SAMSON FROM THE WOMB
BY THE INTELLIGENCE AND INDUSTRY WHICH HE HAD EXHIBITED AS A CLERK IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE MARINE AND WAS ESTEEMED AN ADEPT IN THE MYSTERY OF MERCANTILE POLITICS AT THE CLOSE OF THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY FIVE
SUCH AS USED TO BE OWNED BY THE DUTCHMEN A ROER THEY CALL IT THAT GUN THE BOER I BOUGHT IT FROM MANY YEARS AGO TOLD ME HAD BEEN USED BY HIS FATHER AT THE BATTLE OF THE BLOOD RIVER
FIXED AS THE STARS MORE ENDURING THAN THE MOUNTAINS AS UNALTERABLE AS THE WAY OF THE ETERNAL HUMAN NATURE IS GOD'S KALEIDOSCOPE AND THE LITTLE BITS OF COLOURED GLASS
HE HAD PASSED HIS LAST EXAMINATION WITH HONOURS AND I WAS PROUD OF THEM MUCH PROUDER THAN HE WAS I THINK AND THEN HE MUST NEEDS GO TO THAT SMALLPOX HOSPITAL HE WROTE TO ME THAT HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF SMALLPOX
HE IS FURIOUS ESPECIALLY AS SOME ILL NATURED PERSON HAS PRINTED IT IN A SOCIETY PAPER TO COME TO BUSINESS GOOD AND I TOOK THE DIAMONDS TO STREETER'S TO BE VALUED AS WE ARRANGED
AMONG THE WILD GAME AND THE SAVAGES YES AS I WALKED I BEGAN TO LONG TO SEE THE MOONLIGHT GLEAMING SILVERY WHITE OVER THE WIDE VELDT AND MYSTERIOUS SEA OF BUSH
CIVILIZATION FAILS US UTTERLY BACK BACK WE CREEP AND LAY US LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN ON THE GREAT BREAST OF NATURE SHE THAT PERCHANCE MAY SOOTHE US AND MAKE US FORGET
HE DREAMS OF THE SIGHT OF ZULU IMPIS BREAKING ON THEIR FOES LIKE SURF UPON THE ROCKS AND HIS HEART RISES UP IN REBELLION AGAINST THE STRICT LIMITS OF THE CIVILIZED LIFE AH THIS CIVILIZATION
HE TOLD ME THAT SINCE HE HAD BEEN HOME HE HADN'T SEEN A WOMAN TO TOUCH HER EITHER AS REGARDS HER FIGURE OR THE SWEETNESS OF HER EXPRESSION I WANT YOU TO COME HOME MY DEAR OLD COMRADE
UNDEFILED AS YET BY ANY HUMAN SINKS OF SWELTERING HUMANITY I WOULD GO AGAIN WHERE THE WILD GAME WAS BACK TO THE LAND WHEREOF NONE KNOW THE HISTORY BACK TO THE SAVAGES WHOM I LOVE
AND MANY OTHER BOYS WHOM I SHALL NEVER KNOW MAY IN THE ACTS AND THOUGHTS OF ALLAN QUATERMAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS
AS SUCH STONES HAVE NEVER TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE BEEN PUT ON THE MARKET IN ANYTHING LIKE SUCH QUANTITIES IT APPEARS THAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE OR TWO OF THE LARGEST THEY ARE OF THE FINEST WATER
WE DO NOT PROSTRATE OURSELVES BEFORE IT LIKE THE POOR INDIANS WE FLY HITHER AND THITHER WE CRY FOR MERCY BUT IT IS OF NO USE THE BLACK FATE THUNDERS ON
BUT THIS IS A THING MORE ARDENTLY TO BE WISHED THAN SERIOUSLY TO BE EXPECTED THE PLAN OFFERED TO OUR DELIBERATIONS AFFECTS TOO MANY PARTICULAR INTERESTS INNOVATES UPON TOO MANY LOCAL INSTITUTIONS
AND THE MUTUAL TRANSPORTATION AND EXCHANGE OF THEIR VARIOUS COMMODITIES WITH EQUAL PLEASURE I HAVE AS OFTEN TAKEN NOTICE THAT PROVIDENCE HAS BEEN PLEASED TO GIVE THIS ONE CONNECTED COUNTRY TO ONE UNITED PEOPLE
WE OUGHT TO SEEK IT IN A DIVISION OF THE STATES INTO DISTINCT CONFEDERACIES OR SOVEREIGNTIES HOWEVER EXTRAORDINARY THIS NEW DOCTRINE MAY APPEAR IT NEVERTHELESS HAS ITS ADVOCATES AND CERTAIN CHARACTERS WHO WERE MUCH OPPOSED TO IT FORMERLY
IN THE TRADE TO CHINA AND INDIA WE INTERFERE WITH MORE THAN ONE NATION INASMUCH AS IT ENABLES US TO PARTAKE IN ADVANTAGES WHICH THEY HAD IN A MANNER MONOPOLIZED AND AS WE THEREBY SUPPLY OURSELVES WITH COMMODITIES
ENJOYING THE SAME NATIONAL RIGHTS PRIVILEGES AND PROTECTION AS A NATION WE HAVE MADE PEACE AND WAR AS A NATION WE HAVE VANQUISHED OUR COMMON ENEMIES AS A NATION WE HAVE FORMED ALLIANCES
VARIOUS DIFFICULTIES AND INCONVENIENCES WOULD BE INSEPARABLE FROM SUCH A SITUATION WHEREAS ONE GOVERNMENT WATCHING OVER THE GENERAL AND COMMON INTERESTS AND COMBINING AND DIRECTING THE POWERS AND RESOURCES OF THE WHOLE
JEALOUS AND ALIEN SOVEREIGNTIES SIMILAR SENTIMENTS HAVE HITHERTO PREVAILED AMONG ALL ORDERS AND DENOMINATIONS OF MEN AMONG US TO ALL GENERAL PURPOSES WE HAVE UNIFORMLY BEEN ONE PEOPLE EACH INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN EVERYWHERE
FOR THE INDEPENDENT JOURNAL WEDNESDAY OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN JAY TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
THAT WHEN A PEOPLE OR FAMILY SO DIVIDE IT NEVER FAILS TO BE AGAINST THEMSELVES
A PEOPLE DESCENDED FROM THE SAME ANCESTORS SPEAKING THE SAME LANGUAGE PROFESSING THE SAME RELIGION ATTACHED TO THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT VERY SIMILAR IN THEIR MANNERS AND CUSTOMS AND WHO
IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT JEALOUSIES AND UNEASINESSES MAY GRADUALLY SLIDE INTO THE MINDS AND CABINETS OF OTHER NATIONS AND THAT WE ARE NOT TO EXPECT THAT THEY SHOULD REGARD OUR ADVANCEMENT IN UNION IN POWER AND CONSEQUENCE BY LAND AND BY SEA
AND BEING PERSUADED THAT AMPLE SECURITY FOR BOTH COULD ONLY BE FOUND IN A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT MORE WISELY FRAMED THEY AS WITH ONE VOICE CONVENED THE LATE CONVENTION AT PHILADELPHIA TO TAKE THAT IMPORTANT SUBJECT UNDER CONSIDERATION
