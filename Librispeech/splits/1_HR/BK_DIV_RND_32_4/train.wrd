YET HE HAD SOME PLEASURE IN THE MERE SOUND OF HIS DAUGHTER'S VOICE AND INVARIABLY TURNED TO IT WHEN SHE SPOKE IN THE SUBMISSIVE WAY OF ONE LONG ACCUSTOMED TO OBEY UNDER COERCION HE ATE AND DRANK WHAT THEY GAVE HIM TO EAT AND DRINK AND PUT ON THE CLOAK AND OTHER WRAPPINGS THAT THEY GAVE HIM TO WEAR
AND HAD PREPARED EVERY INCH OF HIS ROAD THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHY HAD HE RETURNED TO FRANCE WHEN HE DID AND NOT SOONER HE HAD NOT RETURNED SOONER HE REPLIED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS OF LIVING IN FRANCE SAVE THOSE HE HAD RESIGNED
MISTER LORRY HELD IT OPEN IN HIS HAND GAZING IN HIS EARNEST FACE KEEP IT FOR ME UNTIL TO MORROW I SHALL SEE HIM TO MORROW YOU REMEMBER AND I HAD BETTER NOT TAKE IT INTO THE PRISON WHY NOT I DON'T KNOW I PREFER NOT TO DO SO
HAD IN A LONG SECLUSION FROM DIRECT LIGHT AND AIR
AFTERWARDS SUPPING AT THEIR DOORS SCANTY AND INSUFFICIENT SUPPERS THOSE AND INNOCENT OF MEAT AS OF MOST OTHER SAUCE TO WRETCHED BREAD YET HUMAN FELLOWSHIP INFUSED SOME NOURISHMENT INTO THE FLINTY VIANDS
ONE OF A LARGE NUMBER AS YOU KNOW I WAS INSUFFERABLE ABOUT LIKING YOU AND NOT LIKING YOU I WISH YOU WOULD FORGET IT I FORGOT IT LONG AGO
AND WHEN HER HUSBAND STOOD UPON HIS FEET SHE DROPPED INSENSIBLE IN HIS ARMS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS HEART AND TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD BETWEEN HIS FACE AND THE BRAWLING CROWD
HE CAME TO HER RELIEF WITH A FIXED DESPAIR OF HIMSELF WHICH MADE THE INTERVIEW UNLIKE ANY OTHER THAT COULD HAVE BEEN HOLDEN IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE MISS MANETTE
YOU WILL DO HIM NO HARM YOU WILL HELP ME TO SEE HIM IF YOU CAN YOUR HUSBAND IS NOT MY BUSINESS HERE RETURNED MADAME DEFARGE LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH PERFECT COMPOSURE IT IS THE DAUGHTER OF YOUR FATHER WHO IS MY BUSINESS HERE
LET ME SOON HEAR FROM YOU DEAR CATHERINE YOU ARE MY ONLY FRIEND YOUR LOVE I DO BUILD UPON I WISH YOUR VISIT AT NORTHANGER MAY BE OVER BEFORE CAPTAIN TILNEY MAKES HIS ENGAGEMENT KNOWN
BUT IT IS OF VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE I HOPE I EARNESTLY HOPE THAT TO YOUR REAL SAFETY IT WILL BE OF NONE BUT TO EVERYTHING ELSE IT IS OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO COMFORT APPEARANCE PROPRIETY
FOR HAD NOT THE CABINET APPEARED SO EXACTLY TO AGREE WITH HIS DESCRIPTION OF HER ADVENTURES SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FELT THE SMALLEST CURIOSITY ABOUT IT THIS WAS THE ONLY COMFORT THAT OCCURRED IMPATIENT TO GET RID OF THOSE HATEFUL EVIDENCES OF HER FOLLY THOSE DETESTABLE PAPERS THEN SCATTERED OVER THE BED
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED ERE SHE RETURNED DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE VOLUME FROM WHICH SO MUCH WAS HOPED HER AVOCATIONS ABOVE HAVING SHUT OUT ALL NOISE BUT WHAT SHE CREATED HERSELF
THAN A BEAUTY FROM HER CRADLE CAN EVER RECEIVE MISSUS MORLAND WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN AND WISHED TO SEE HER CHILDREN EVERYTHING THEY OUGHT TO BE BUT HER TIME WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED IN LYING IN AND TEACHING THE LITTLE ONES
CATHERINE BY WHOM THIS MEETING WAS WHOLLY UNEXPECTED RECEIVED HER BROTHER WITH THE LIVELIEST PLEASURE AND HE BEING OF A VERY AMIABLE DISPOSITION AND SINCERELY ATTACHED TO HER GAVE EVERY PROOF ON HIS SIDE OF EQUAL SATISFACTION
THAN MISS TILNEY TOLD HER OF HER FATHER'S HAVING JUST DETERMINED UPON QUITTING BATH BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK HERE WAS A BLOW THE PAST SUSPENSE OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN EASE AND QUIET TO THE PRESENT DISAPPOINTMENT
CATHERINE'S COUNTENANCE FELL AND IN A VOICE OF MOST SINCERE CONCERN SHE ECHOED MISS TILNEY'S CONCLUDING WORDS BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK
AND AN APPREHENSION OF NOT BEING EQUALLY BELOVED BY THE OTHER SHE WOULD AT EACH MOMENT OF EACH DAY HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY HAPPY BUT SHE WAS NOW IN THE FOURTH WEEK OF HER VISIT BEFORE THE GENERAL CAME HOME
SHE SAID NOBODY'S LIKELY TO TOUCH THEM HAD HE SMELT THEM I THOUGHT HE HAD AND ADDED THAT HE SEEMED GREATLY ATTACHED TO THEM YOU THINK HE WOULD BE UPSET SHE QUERIED
AND SAID I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THE CARRIAGE TO OURSELVES AND HE LAUGHED PLEASANTLY AND SAID THAT SOME PEOPLE MADE SUCH A FUSS OVER A LITTLE THING BUT EVEN HE GREW STRANGELY DEPRESSED AFTER WE HAD STARTED AND SO WHEN WE REACHED CREWE
THE WEATHER IS A THING THAT IS BEYOND ME ALTOGETHER I NEVER CAN UNDERSTAND IT THE BAROMETER IS USELESS IT IS AS MISLEADING AS THE NEWSPAPER FORECAST
ONLY HE WAS MORE RESPECTABLE THAN GOOD QUEEN BESS HE DIDN'T PUT UP AT THE PUBLIC HOUSES
AND AFTER THAT TAKE THEIR DIPLOMA THEN I WONDERED HOW LONG I HAD TO LIVE
AND SPECULATE AS TO HOW BEAUTIFUL THE BIT OF THE TAIL THAT IS LOST NO DOUBT WAS WE IN THIS AGE DO NOT SEE THE BEAUTY OF THAT DOG
WHICH YOU MIXED WITH WATER AND CALLED LEMONADE PLENTY OF TEA AND A BOTTLE OF WHISKY IN CASE AS GEORGE SAID WE GOT UPSET IT SEEMED TO ME THAT GEORGE HARPED TOO MUCH ON THE GETTING UPSET IDEA
WE COME BACK FEELING STILL MORE ANGRY AGAINST HIM AND WITH A VAGUE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE HAS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT IT WAS TOO BRIGHT AND SUNNY ON THIS ESPECIAL MORNING FOR GEORGE'S BLOOD CURDLING READINGS ABOUT
AND SAYS OH NO SIR
FOR THOSE WHOSE FANCY DOES NOT LIE THAT WAY IT WOULD BE LIKE LIVING IN A CHURCH NO WHAT WAS SAD IN HIS CASE WAS THAT HE WHO DIDN'T CARE FOR CARVED OAK
THE KEY'S IN IT BUT THE KEY WAS NOT IN IT MISTER JAMIESON SHOOK IT BUT IT WAS A HEAVY DOOR WELL LOCKED AND THEN HE STOOPED AND BEGAN PUNCHING AROUND THE KEYHOLE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL WHEN HE STOOD UP HIS FACE WAS EXULTANT
IT WAS QUITE DARK BUT SHE COULD SEE HIS WHITE SHIRT BOSOM FROM THE FOURTH STEP SHE FIRED AS HE FELL SOMEBODY IN THE BILLIARD ROOM SCREAMED AND RAN WHEN THE ALARM WAS RAISED
WHEN THE MESSAGE CAME TO COME UP FOR TWO GIRLS AND THEIR TRUNKS I SUPPOSED THERE WAS SOMETHING DOING AND AS THIS HERE WOMAN HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR WORK IN THE VILLAGE I THOUGHT I'D BRING HER ALONG ALREADY I HAD ACQUIRED THE TRUE SUBURBANITE ABILITY TO
AND I WENT I LEFT MISTER JAMIESON AND THE DAY DETECTIVE GOING OVER EVERY INCH OF THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE POUNDING PROBING AND MEASURING
THE SECOND MISSUS ARMSTRONG HAD BEEN A WIDOW WITH A CHILD A LITTLE GIRL THIS CHILD NOW PERHAPS TWENTY WAS LOUISE ARMSTRONG HAVING TAKEN HER STEPFATHER'S NAME AND WAS AT PRESENT IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE FAMILY
WHEN WARNER MARRIED ROSIE LIDDY SNIFFED AND SAID WHAT I TOOK FOR FAITHFULNESS IN ROSIE HAD BEEN NOTHING BUT MAWKISHNESS I HAVE NOT YET OUTLIVED LIDDY'S CONTEMPT BECAUSE I GAVE THEM SILVER KNIVES AND FORKS AS A WEDDING GIFT
I PROMISED TO LOOK AFTER LITTLE LUCIEN AND SAT WITH HER UNTIL THE INTERVALS OF CONSCIOUSNESS GREW SHORTER AND FINALLY CEASED ALTOGETHER
MOREOVER HE SUSPECTED WHAT LOUISE DID NOT THAT THE MONEY WAS HIDDEN AT SUNNYSIDE HE HAD A SCRAP OF PAPER THAT INDICATED A CONCEALED ROOM SOMEWHERE HIS INHERITED CUPIDITY WAS AROUSED EAGER TO GET HALSEY AND JACK BAILEY OUT OF THE HOUSE
TOOK A NAP ALL RIGHT I SAID GO ON
I HAVE BEEN TO THE CLUB HOUSE HE SAID AND AMONG MISTER ARMSTRONG'S EFFECTS I FOUND THESE ONE IS CURIOUS THE OTHER IS PUZZLING THE FIRST WAS A SHEET OF CLUB NOTE PAPER ON WHICH WAS WRITTEN OVER AND OVER THE NAME HALSEY B INNES
FROM THAT DAY THINGS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE AND EVERY MORNING CROWDS PRESENTED THEMSELVES BEFORE THE EMPEROR COMPLAINING OF THE ROBBERIES MURDERS AND OTHER CRIMES THAT WERE COMMITTED NIGHTLY IN THE STREETS
HAVING SETTLED HIS AFFAIRS WITH THE EMPEROR AND HIS ENEMIES VIRGILIUS HAD TIME TO THINK OF OTHER THINGS AND HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO FALL IN LOVE
WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS BOTH HER SISTERS PUT TOGETHER AS BEAUTIFUL AS SHE ALONE COULD BE ONE SUMMER DAY WHEN THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE POURING DOWN ON THE EARTH THE THREE SISTERS WENT TO THE WOOD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE MOUNTAIN TO PICK STRAWBERRIES
AND WENT STRAIGHT TO THE COBBLER'S STALL LOOK HERE SAID SHE THIS CREATURE SAYS HE IS OUR LOST SON HE HAS BEEN TELLING ME HOW HE WAS STOLEN SEVEN YEARS AGO AND BEWITCHED BY A FAIRY
AND WHATSOEVER HE WAS TAUGHT HE DID NOT LEARN IT HIS MOTHER NEVER WISHED HIM TO DO ANYTHING HE DID NOT LIKE SO SHE SAID WELL STAY AT HOME MY SON AND HE STAYED AT HOME EATING AND SLEEPING
YOU WILL INVITE ME TO BE GODMOTHER TO THE PRINCESS AND THIS IS HOW YOU MUST SEND THE INVITATION HIDDEN IN THE CRADLE YOU WILL FIND A GOOSE'S WING THROW THIS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND I WILL BE WITH YOU DIRECTLY
AND BEGAN TO CRY BUT THE BOY STRUGGLED TO BE FREE SAYING DEAR FATHER PUT ME DOWN I HAVE GOT A NEW MOTHER WHO IS BETTER THAN THE OLD ONE AND A NEW FATHER WHO IS BETTER THAN YOU THEN HIS FATHER SAT HIM DOWN AND SAID
AS HIS FATHER SPOKE THINGS GREW CLEARER TO JEM'S MIND AND HE SAW NOW THAT HE HAD NOT BEEN DREAMING BUT HAD REALLY SERVED THE OLD WOMAN SEVEN YEARS IN THE SHAPE OF A SQUIRREL AS HE THOUGHT IT OVER RAGE FILLED HIS HEART
THEY ALL STOOD LOOKING FROM ONE ROAD TO ANOTHER IN PERPLEXITY THE PATHS RADIATED FROM THE LITTLE CLEARING LIKE THE RAYS OF THE MIDDAY SUN AND EACH PATH SEEMED LIKE ALL THE OTHERS FILES AND THE ROSE PRINCESS WHO HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME GOOD FRIENDS
BY AND BY A NOISE SOUNDED FROM WITHIN THE HUT ARE YOU READY ASKED SHAGGY YES BROTHER CAME THE REPLY AND THE DOOR WAS THROWN OPEN TO ALLOW THE UGLY ONE TO STEP FORTH BETSY MIGHT HAVE LAUGHED ALOUD
TIK TOK IS THE ONLY ONE OF OUR PARTY FITTED TO UNDERTAKE THE JOB WHAT MUST I DO ASKED TIK TOK OBEY ORDERS REPLIED ANN WHEN THE OFFICERS COMMAND YOU TO DO ANYTHING YOU MUST DO IT THAT IS ALL
IN A MILD AND SYMPATHETIC TONE OF VOICE
NOT FOR A SIN GLE SEC OND I CAN NOT FIGHT
THAT IS A KINDLY DEED REPLIED UGLY IN A SAD VOICE BUT I DREAD TO GO BACK TO THE WORLD IN THIS DIREFUL CONDITION UNLESS I REMAIN FOREVER MASKED MY DREADFUL FACE WOULD CURDLE ALL THE MILK AND STOP ALL THE CLOCKS
I BELIEVE THE MAGICIAN WAS GOING THE OTHER WAY AND PROBABLY HE WENT MUCH FASTER THAN WE ARE GOING IT'S FAST ENOUGH TO SUIT ME REMARKED SHAGGY GENTLY REMOVING POLYCHROME'S HEEL FROM HIS LEFT EYE
WHO HAD NO IDEA WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER THEN A LITTLE DISTANCE AWAY BUT UNSEEN BY THE OTHERS IN THE INKY DARKNESS SLID BETSY AND HANK WHILE BEHIND THEM WERE SHAGGY AND POLYCHROME AND FINALLY FILES AND THE PRINCESS
AND UNLESS RUGGEDO'S EYES BEHELD THE TALISMAN IT COULD NOT AFFECT HIM AS FOR BETSY BOBBIN AND HER MULE HE BELIEVED KALIKO HAD PLACED THEM IN THE SLIMY CAVE WHILE ANN AND HER OFFICERS HE THOUGHT SAFELY IMPRISONED IN THE PIT
AT THE NAME OF THAT EXTREMELY EXCLUSIVE CLUB TOODLES LOOKED SCARED AND STOPPED SHORT NONSENSE HE PROTESTED BUT IN AN AWE STRUCK TONE WHAT DO YOU MEAN A MEMBER
A SQUARE BACKED BLACK MONSTER BLOCKING HALF THE STREET WITH SUDDEN IRON SHOD STAMPINGS FIERCE JINGLES AND HEAVY BLOWING SIGHS THE HARSHLY FESTIVE ILL OMENED GLARE OF A LARGE AND PROSPEROUS PUBLIC HOUSE FACED THE OTHER END OF BRETT STREET ACROSS A WIDE ROAD
WHICH DEFIES TIME WITH SCORNFUL DISREGARD AS IF IT WERE A RATHER VULGAR CONVENTION SUBMITTED TO BY THE MASS OF INFERIOR MANKIND MANY OTHER CONVENTIONS EASIER TO SET ASIDE ALAS FAILED TO OBTAIN HER RECOGNITION
HE HAS LOST THE SKILL NECESSARY FOR HIS MANUAL OCCUPATION HE TOLD ME ALL THIS HIMSELF WITH THE SWEETEST PATIENCE BUT THEN HE SAID
BECAUSE THE SIGHT OF FACES TROUBLED HIS INSPIRATION DEVELOPED IN SOLITUDE IN THAT CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE PATHETIC IN HIS GROTESQUE AND INCURABLE OBESITY WHICH HE HAD TO DRAG LIKE A GALLEY SLAVE'S BULLET TO THE END OF HIS DAYS
AND CHARLATANS OF ALL AGES AND CONDITIONS WHO UNSUBSTANTIAL AND LIGHT BOBBING UP LIKE CORKS SHOW BEST THE DIRECTION OF THE SURFACE CURRENTS
BUSY FISHING FOR HIS HAT BUT WHEN HE GOT IT FROM UNDER THE SOFA HE HELD IT AS IF HE DID NOT KNOW THE USE OF A HAT WELL HE'S WAITING FOR YOU SAID MISSUS VERLOC AT LAST I SAY ADOLF
IT MADE HER UNEASY IT MADE HER NERVOUS SHE CONFESSED AND THAT FROM THE CALM WINNIE SOUNDED LIKE EXAGGERATION BUT IN TRUTH
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET ANOTHER SUSPECT PATCH OF DIM LIGHT ISSUED FROM MISTER VERLOC'S SHOP FRONT HUNG WITH PAPERS HEAVING WITH VAGUE PILES OF CARDBOARD BOXES AND THE SHAPES OF BOOKS THE ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
HE HAD A MUCH MORE ACUTE AND QUICK SENSIBILITY OF NATURE ATTENDED WITH A LITTLE SORENESS OF TEMPER THO THIS NEVER TRANSPORTED HIM TO ANY THING WHICH LOOKED LIKE MALIGNANCY
WHICH MIGHT HAPPEN OR NOT JUST AS CHANCE ORDERED IT KING WILLIAM WAS OF AN OPINION AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR QUOTH TRIM THAT EVERY THING WAS PREDESTINED FOR US IN THIS WORLD
THIS IS TO SERVE FOR PARENTS AND GOVERNORS INSTEAD OF A WHOLE VOLUME UPON THE SUBJECT I COULD NOT GIVE THE READER THIS STROKE IN MY UNCLE TOBY'S PICTURE BY THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH I DREW THE OTHER PARTS OF IT
I SHOULD HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THIS METHOD BUT THAT I THINK IT MUST SMELL TOO STRONG OF THE LAMP AND BE RENDER'D STILL MORE OPEROSE
UNLESS IT WAS IN MY POWER WHICH IT IS NOT TO INCREASE THEIR MEASURE BROTHER SHANDY ANSWERED MY UNCLE TOBY LOOKING WISTFULLY IN HIS FACE YOU ARE MUCH MISTAKEN IN THIS POINT
THAT BED CURTAINS IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE TAKEN THEIR NAME FROM THEM NOR HAVE THE HORN WORKS HE SPEAKS OF ANY THING IN THE WORLD TO DO WITH THE HORN WORKS OF CUCKOLDOM BUT THE CURTIN SIR IS THE WORD WE USE IN FORTIFICATION
NOR SHALL MY PENCIL BE GUIDED BY ANY ONE WIND INSTRUMENT WHICH EVER WAS BLOWN UPON EITHER ON THIS
AND THAT I HAVE NOT LEFT A SINGLE INCH FOR IT FOR MY UNCLE TOBY TOOK THE LIBERTY OF INCROACHING UPON HIS KITCHEN GARDEN FOR THE SAKE OF ENLARGING HIS WORKS ON THE BOWLING GREEN AND FOR THAT REASON GENERALLY RAN HIS FIRST AND SECOND PARALLELS BETWIXT TWO ROWS OF HIS CABBAGES AND HIS CAULIFLOWERS
BY A DECREE FAST BOUND DOWN IN IRON HAD BEEN DESTINED SHE GAVE A NOD TO NATURE
TIS ONE OF THE NUMBER OF THOSE MANY THINGS WHICH A MAN HAD BETTER DO OVER AGAIN THAN DISPUTE ABOUT IT THAT WHATEVER TOWN OR FORTRESS THE CORPORAL WAS AT WORK UPON DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR CAMPAIGN MY UNCLE TOBY ALWAYS TOOK CARE ON THE INSIDE OF HIS SENTRY BOX
READING OF ONE BOOK AFTER ANOTHER FILLED UP HER TIME BUT ON THE SIXTH DAY WHEN THE COACHMAN CAME BACK WITHOUT HIM SHE FELT THAT NOW SHE WAS UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF STIFLING THE THOUGHT OF HIM AND OF WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE JUST AT THAT TIME HER LITTLE GIRL WAS TAKEN ILL
THE SECRETARY KNOCKED THE DOOR OPENED AND LEVIN WAS MET BY TWO RED FACED GENTLEMEN WHO DARTED OUT
AS THOUGH IT WERE A HOLIDAY FOR HIMSELF AND EVERYONE ELSE AND ABOVE ALL UNPLEASANT WAS THAT PARTICULAR SMILE WITH WHICH SHE RESPONDED TO HIS SMILE NOISILY TALKING THEY ALL WENT INTO THE HOUSE
OH I DON'T CARE SHE SAID HER LIPS WERE QUIVERING AND HE FANCIED THAT HER EYES LOOKED WITH STRANGE FURY AT HIM FROM UNDER THE VEIL I TELL YOU THAT'S NOT THE POINT I CAN'T DOUBT THAT BUT SEE WHAT HE WRITES TO ME READ IT
AND HOW THEY WERE PRESERVED AND OF THE CARRIAGES AND DOGCARTS IN WHICH THE SHOOTING PARTY HAD BEEN DRIVEN AND THE LUNCHEON PAVILION THAT HAD BEEN RIGGED UP AT THE MARSH I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU SAID LEVIN SITTING UP IN THE HAY
WITH A BROAD RED BEARD GRAY ON HIS CHEEKS OPENED THE GATE
PUT IT IN THE RIGHT SIDE WHISPERED STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH AS WITH HIS BROTHER LEVIN FOLLOWED THE MARSHAL OF HIS DISTRICT TO THE TABLE BUT LEVIN HAD FORGOTTEN BY NOW THE CALCULATIONS THAT HAD BEEN EXPLAINED TO HIM
BUT WHY SHOULD I GO BUT DO YOU KNOW YOU ARE PREPARING TROUBLE FOR YOURSELF SAID STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH FINDING HIS CAP AND GETTING UP HOW SO DO YOU SUPPOSE I DON'T SEE THE LINE YOU'VE TAKEN UP WITH YOUR WIFE
THE COUNT GOES INTO EVERYTHING HIMSELF AH WHAT A HUSBAND DOLLY WAS GLAD WHEN ANNA CAME IN AND BY HER ENTRANCE PUT A STOP TO ANNUSHKA'S GOSSIP
ILL LUCK AND THE FIDDLER ONCE UPON A TIME SAINT NICHOLAS CAME DOWN INTO THE WORLD TO TAKE A PEEP AT THE OLD PLACE AND SEE HOW THINGS LOOKED IN THE SPRING TIME ON HE STEPPED ALONG THE ROAD TO THE TOWN WHERE HE USED TO LIVE
BUT WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE STOOD WAS A GREAT ARCHED DOOR OF ADAMANT THE DOOR WAS TIGHTLY SHUT AND THERE WAS NEITHER LOCK NOR KEY TO IT UPON THE DOOR WERE WRITTEN THESE WORDS IN LETTERS OF FLAME
AND MY SON HIMSELF SHALL GO WITH YOU TO SHOW YOU THE WAY THAT IS GOOD SAID THE SERVANT'S COMRADE AND IF HE WILL DO SO I WILL PAY HIM WELL FOR HIS TROUBLE SO THE YOUNG MAN PUT ON HIS HAT AND TOOK UP HIS STICK
CLATTERED THE BOTTOM OF HIS CANICAN AGAINST THE TABLE
AT THE FARTHER END WAS A GOLDEN THRONE AND UPON IT SAT A LADY MORE LOVELY AND BEAUTIFUL THAN A DREAM HER EYES AS BRIGHT AS DIAMONDS HER CHEEKS LIKE ROSE LEAVES AND HER HAIR LIKE SPUN GOLD
UP STEPPED THE WISE MAN TO THE GALLOWS AND GAVE IT A SHARP RAP WITH HIS STAFF THEN LO AND BEHOLD THE GALLOWS WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A FINE INN WITH LIGHTS IN THE WINDOWS
AND FLEW THROUGH THE AIR SO SWIFTLY THAT THE STARS APPEARED TO SLIDE AWAY BEHIND THEM IN A MOMENT HE SET THE YOUNG MAN AGAIN UPON THE GROUND AND ABEN HASSEN THE FOOL FOUND HIMSELF AT THE END OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE A VAST AND SPLENDID GARDEN
WELL I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU DO IT SAID SIMON AGRICOLA THEN I WILL SHOW YOU SAID BABO HE SPREAD A BED OF COLD DEAD ASHES UPON HIS PALM NOW SAID HE I WILL TAKE THE EMBER UPON THAT AGRICOLA ROLLED UP HIS EYES LIKE A DUCK IN A THUNDER STORM
AND A RHETORICIAN AN ASTRONOMER AN ASTROLOGER AND A PHILOSOPHER AS WELL TIS A LONG LIST OF EXCELLENCY SAID OLD BIDPAI
NOT A HARD WORD NOT A HARD LOOK ESCAPES HIM IT IS ONLY AT NIGHT WHEN I HEAR HIM SIGHING IN HIS SLEEP AND SOMETIMES WHEN I SEE HIM DREAMING IN THE MORNING HOURS THAT I KNOW HOW HOPELESSLY I AM LOSING THE LOVE HE ONCE FELT FOR ME HE HIDES
I MEANT IT FOR THE BEST LOTS OF PEOPLE IN OUR SITUATION HAVE TRIED THE BLACKSMITH AND FOUND HIM QUITE AS GOOD AS A CLERGYMAN AND A MOST AMIABLE MAN I BELIEVE INTO THE BARGAIN NEVER MIND
HE TRIMMED THE LAMP ON THE TABLE BESIDE HIM AND LOOKED OUT AT THE NIGHT THE STABLE CLOCK WAS CHIMING THE HALF HOUR PAST ELEVEN AS HE WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND THE FIRST RAIN DROPS WERE BEGINNING TO FALL
IT'S AN ENTIRELY NEW IDEA WOULD YOU MIND TRYING THE BLACKSMITH AT GRETNA GREEN NO EARTHLY CONSIDERATION ANSWERED NEELIE INDIGNANTLY WOULD INDUCE ME TO BE MARRIED BY A BLACKSMITH DON'T BE OFFENDED PLEADED ALLAN
I DECLINE EVEN TO THINK OF OUR MARRIAGE TILL MY MIND IS MADE EASY FIRST ON THE SUBJECT OF THE LAW BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE LAW
AS I HOPE TO BE SAVED ALL THE OLD HARRIDANS OF THE WORLD OF FASHION WHOM
HIS PAST EXISTENCE HAD DISCIPLINED HIM TO BEAR DISASTER AND INSULT AS FEW HAPPIER MEN COULD HAVE BORNE THEM
HAD NOT TURNED UP ALIVE AND WELL IN THE NICK OF TIME TO CONFRONT HER THE SCENE TOOK PLACE AT THE LAWYER'S OFFICE AND CAME OUT IN THE EVIDENCE AT THE POLICE COURT THE WOMAN WAS HANDSOME AND THE SAILOR WAS A GOOD NATURED MAN
HIS FACE SHOWED SIGNS OF WEAR AND TEAR VERY SAD TO SEE IN SO YOUNG A MAN BUT HE SPOKE OF HIMSELF AND HIS FUTURE WITH A COURAGE AND HOPEFULNESS WHICH MEN OF TWICE HIS YEARS IF HE HAS SUFFERED AS I SUSPECT HIM TO HAVE SUFFERED MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
IT IS FROM HEAVEN SHE THOUGHT THAT I EXPECT EVERYTHING IT IS FROM HEAVEN I OUGHT TO EXPECT EVERYTHING AND SHE LOOKED AT HER CRUCIFIX WITH A DEVOTION FULL OF TENDER LOVE THERE SHE SAID HANGS BEFORE ME A MASTER WHO NEVER FORGETS
PORTHOS FANCIES HIMSELF AT LA ROCHELLE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN AS THEY RETURNED FREIGHTED WITH BOTTLES
REPEATED RAOUL MADAME SHOOK HER HEAD AS IF SHE WERE JUST AWAKENING AND THEN SAID
AND THEN TOO WE SEE SOME OF THE OFFICERS OF THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD I SHOULD NOT LIKE THAT SAID PORTHOS THERE IS NOT MUCH AMUSEMENT IN IT AT ALL EVENTS SAID D'ARTAGNAN
OH THEY SHALL HAVE AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE GENTLY GENTLY MY MAN SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE ARE GETTING ON A LITTLE TOO FAST A FEW OATS AND A GOOD BED NOTHING MORE SOME BRAN AND WATER FOR MY HORSE SAID PORTHOS
WHAT IS THERE FOR ME TO BE SATISFIED OR DISSATISFIED ABOUT MADAME
THAT IS A DISH I SHOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO TASTE MONSIEUR DU VALLON IS IT POSSIBLE A WHOLE LAMB ABSOLUTELY AN ENTIRE LAMB SIRE
I DO UNTIL I HAVE A PROOF OF IT FORGIVE ME MADAME BUT SHE HAS GIVEN ME HER WORD
AFTER A PROLONGED REFLECTION ON THE SUBJECT THE MOST INGENIOUS MEANS THAT SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WAS TO LET HIMSELF ROLL OFF THE SACK ON TO THE FLOOR MURMURING AT THE SAME TIME AGAINST HIMSELF THE WORD STUPID BUT
HE MURMURED MADAME DE CHEVREUSE D'ARTAGNAN WOULD NOT GO HOME UNTIL HE HAD LEARNT EVERYTHING
HER COMING ITSELF HAD NOT BEEN A DECISION ON THAT OCCASION SHE HAD SIMPLY STARTED OSMOND GAVE NO SOUND AND NOW EVIDENTLY WOULD GIVE NONE HE WOULD LEAVE IT ALL TO HER FROM PANSY SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THAT WAS VERY SIMPLE
WITH THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE DELAY
HAD ONLY BEEN THE DESIRE TO LEAVE HER AT LIBERTY PANSY BENT FORWARD RAISED HER FACE NEARER AND NEARER AND WITH A LITTLE MURMUR WHICH EVIDENTLY EXPRESSED A DEEP LONGING ANSWERED THAT SHE HAD GREATLY WISHED HER TO SPEAK AND THAT SHE BEGGED HER TO ADVISE HER NOW
EACH AGGRESSIVE FACT OF HIS FACE HIS FIGURE HIS PRESENCE JUSTIFIED OF ITS INTENSE IDENTITY AND MADE ONE WITH THIS ACT OF POSSESSION SO HAD SHE HEARD OF THOSE WRECKED AND UNDER WATER
AND THE FIRST USE SHE MADE OF IT WAS TO PRETEND SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM WHEN I TALK OF YOUR HELPING ME I TALK GREAT NONSENSE SHE SAID WITH A QUICK SMILE THE IDEA OF MY TROUBLING YOU WITH MY DOMESTIC EMBARRASSMENTS THE MATTER'S VERY SIMPLE
HE WAS A THANKLESS SUBJECT OF REFERENCE IT WAS DISAGREEABLE TO HAVE TO THINK OF A PERSON WHO WAS SORE AND SOMBRE ABOUT YOU AND WHOM YOU COULD YET DO NOTHING TO RELIEVE
AND THE GOOD SISTER GAVE A KNOWING LAUGH SHE LED ISABEL OUT OF THE ROOM THROUGH SEVERAL CORRIDORS AND UP A LONG STAIRCASE ALL THESE DEPARTMENTS WERE SOLID AND BARE LIGHT AND CLEAN
IT'S NOTHING TO COME TO EUROPE SHE SAID TO ISABEL IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME ONE NEEDS SO MANY REASONS FOR THAT IT IS SOMETHING TO STAY AT HOME THIS IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT
AND IT WAS WITH AN EFFORT IN A MOMENT THAT SHE ANSWERED HIM HOW CAN YOU HELP ME SHE ASKED IN A LOW TONE AS IF SHE WERE TAKING WHAT HE HAD SAID SERIOUSLY ENOUGH TO MAKE THE ENQUIRY IN CONFIDENCE BY INDUCING YOU TO TRUST ME
AND FORMED A LARGE ENTRENCHED CAMP NEAR THAT OF THE ENGLISH WHO THUS WHILE STILL BESIEGING VANNES WERE THEMSELVES ENCLOSED BY A VASTLY SUPERIOR FORCE THE KING OF FRANCE HIMSELF ARRIVED AT THE FRENCH CAMP THE FRENCH ALTHOUGH SO GREATLY SUPERIOR
THEY ROWED BY TURNS ALL WERE FAIRLY EXPERT AT THE EXERCISE FOR IN THOSE DAYS THE THAMES WAS AT ONCE THE GREAT HIGHWAY AND PLAYGROUND OF LONDON
OF DISTINGUISHING HIMSELF THOSE WHO RIDE WITH HIM MAY BE CERTAIN OF A CHANCE OF DOING VALOROUS DEEDS I WILL GO ACROSS THE BRIDGE TOMORROW AND WILL HAVE A TALK WITH MASTER FLETCHER THE SOONER YOU ARE APPRENTICED
SHE LEANT AGAINST THE WALL WITH A FAINT GROAN OF EXHAUSTION AND DISAPPOINTMENT
IT SLID DOWN THE ROPE WHEN THEIR WEIGHT WAS APPLIED TO IT AT LAST THEY SUCCEEDED IN FINDING OUT A KNOT WHICH WOULD HOLD THIS WAS DONE BY TYING A KNOT CLOSE TO ONE END OF A PIECE OF THE STRAND THEN SUFFICIENT WAS LEFT TO FORM THE LOOP
YOU MAY BE SURE THE KNIGHT REPLIED
AND HIS WEIGHT HAS SORELY TRIED ME HIS NAME IS WALTER AND I TRUST SHE ADDED LOOKING AT THE POWERFUL FIGURE OF HER HOST THAT HE WILL GROW UP AS STRAIGHT AND AS STALWART AS YOURSELF
THE FEVER ABATED BUT LEFT HER PROSTRATE IN STRENGTH FOR A FEW WEEKS SHE LINGERED
AND THE CITY OF VANNES WAS TO BE GIVEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE CARDINALS TO DISPOSE OF AS THEY CHOSE IT WAS SPECIALLY PROVIDED
APPEARED ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE COURTYARD HE COULD HEAR SOUNDS OF SHOUTING AND SINGING WITHIN THE CASTLE AND KNEW THAT A GREAT FEAST WAS GOING ON DESCENDING A STEP OR TWO HE HELD PARLEY WITH RALPH
IT'S STILL WITHIN ME WHISPERING WHISPERING URGING ME AWAY FROM YOU FROM MARTIN FROM EVERY HUMAN THING BIDDING ME GIVE MYSELF UP SURRENDER MY HUMANITY ITS SEAL SHE SOBBED
DOWN IT WAS POURING AN AVALANCHE OF MEN I CAUGHT THE GLINT OF HELMETS AND CORSELETS THOSE IN THE VAN WERE MOUNTED GALLOPING TWO ABREAST UPON SURE FOOTED MOUNTAIN PONIES THEIR SHORT SWORDS LIFTED HIGH FLICKERED
THE LITTLE FOUR RAYED PRINT IN THE GREAT DUST OF THE CRUMBLING RUIN AND ITS COLOSSAL TWIN ON THE BREAST OF THE POPPIED VALLEY I TURNED ASIDE CREPT THROUGH THE SHATTERED PORTAL AND LOOKED OVER THE HAUNTED HOLLOW UNBELIEVING I RUBBED MY EYES
FOR GOD'S SAKE DICK HOLD FAST TO YOURSELF REMEMBER RUTH HE SHOOK HIS HEAD VIOLENTLY AS THOUGH TO BE RID OF SOME CLINGING CLOYING THING I'LL NOT FORGET AGAIN HE SAID
BENT DOWN AND STARED IN UTTER DISBELIEF OF WHAT MY OWN EYES BEHELD FOR STONE AND EARTH HAD BEEN CRUSHED COMPRESSED INTO A SMOOTH MICROSCOPICALLY GRAINED
HE LAUGHED I'M FOOT LOOSE AND FANCY FREE
TO ME DRIFTED ONLY THE WAILINGS OF OUR FLIGHT AND THE WHIMPERING TERROR OF THE PONY I TURNED MY HEAD CAUTIOUSLY UPON THE VERY EDGE OF THE FLYING BLOCKS SQUATTED DRAKE AND VENTNOR
HUNG PENDENT CLUSTERS OF OTHER DISKS SWARMED LIKE THE GLOBULAR HIVING OF THE CONSTELLATION HERCULES CAPTURED STARS AND EACH OF THESE PRISONED THE IMAGE OF OUR SUN A HUNDRED FEET BELOW US WAS THE CRATER FLOOR UP FROM IT
I FELT MYSELF LEAP OUTWARD OUTWARD AND OUTWARD INTO
AND BEN LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT BAB WHO FELT HER CHUBBY FACE ALL OVER AND EXAMINED HER DINGY HANDS WITH A SOLEMN AIR ASKING EAGERLY WILL IT BREAK OUT ON ME FORE I GET TO THE CIRCUS
TO SHOW HIM HOW THE DISSECTED MAP WENT TOGETHER AND NEVER SMILED AT HIS MISTAKES SO KIND SO VERY KIND WAS SHE TO THEM ALL THAT WHEN AFTER AN HOUR OF MERRY PLAY SHE TOOK HER BROTHER IN TO BED
SO THEY LAY ABOUT ON THE GRASS IN THE SHADE OF THE BIG ELM LANGUIDLY DISCUSSING THEIR VARIOUS WRONGS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS IT'S THE MEANEST FOURTH I EVER SAW CAN'T HAVE NO CRACKERS BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S HORSE GOT SCARED LAST YEAR
WENT DOWN AGAIN ON SANCHO'S BREAST AS IF THERE WERE NO OTHER REFUGE LEFT YOU SHALL STAY HERE AND NO ONE SHALL TAKE YOU AWAY AGAINST YOUR WILL I CALLED YOU MY BOY IN PLAY NOW
UNPROPITIOUS THORNY HAD GONE OUT OF TOWN WITH HIS SISTER TO PASS THE DAY TWO OF THE BEST PLAYERS DID NOT APPEAR AND THE OTHERS WERE SOMEWHAT EXHAUSTED BY THE FESTIVITIES WHICH BEGAN AT SUNRISE FOR THEM
BAB WITH A FACE AS RED AS A LOBSTER AND STREAKED WITH TEARS SHOES WHITE WITH DUST PLAYFROCK TORN AT THE GATHERS SOMETHING BUNDLED UP IN HER APRON AND ONE SHOE DOWN AT THE HEEL AS IF IT HURT HER
AND DRAWING BEN DOWN BESIDE HER ON THE WIDE STEP MISS CELIA TOOK OUT THE LETTERS WITH A SHADOW CREEPING OVER HER FACE AS SOFTLY AS THE TWILIGHT WAS STEALING OVER THE WORLD WHILE THE DEW FELL AND EVERY THING GREW STILL AND DIM
WHO FELT BITTERLY TOWARD ALL MANKIND AT THAT INSTANT BECAUSE HE KNEW THERE WAS NO HOPE OF HIS GOING SAY THAT AGAIN AND I'LL KNOCK YOUR HEAD OFF AND BEN FACED ROUND WITH A GESTURE WHICH CAUSED THE OTHER TO SKIP OUT OF REACH PRECIPITATELY
THE LITERATURE OF POWER AND THE LITERATURE OF KNOWLEDGE
ENGLISH FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY PAST HAS BEEN ASSIMILATING THE PHRASEOLOGY OF PICTORIAL ART FOR HALF A CENTURY THE PHRASEOLOGY OF THE GREAT GERMAN METAPHYSICAL MOVEMENT OF EIGHTY YEARS AGO IN PART ALSO
IT DEALS NOT LIKE HAMLET WITH THE PROBLEMS WHICH BESET ONE OF EXCEPTIONAL TEMPERAMENT BUT WITH MERE HUMAN NATURE IT BRINGS BEFORE US A GROUP OF PERSONS
OF UNDERSTANDING AND BEING TOUCHED BY THE PRESENCE OF GREAT MATTERS IN SPITE OF THAT HAPPY LIGHTNESS OF HEART SO JEALOUSLY FENCED ABOUT
STIMULATED TO READ MORE CAREFULLY BY SHAKESPEARE'S OWN PROFOUNDER TOUCHES THE READER WILL NOTE THE VIVID REALITY THE SUBTLE INTERCHANGE OF LIGHT AND SHADE
TURNED THE THING INTO A TALE INCLUDED IN HIS HEPTAMERON OF CIVIL DISCOURSES WHERE IT STILL FIGURES AS A GENUINE PIECE WITH TOUCHES OF UNDESIGNED POETRY A QUAINT FIELD FLOWER HERE AND THERE OF DICTION OR SENTIMENT
ASSERT SOMETHING OF HIS OWN HUMOUR SOMETHING THAT COMES NOT OF THE WORLD WITHOUT BUT OF A VISION WITHIN SO GIBBON MOULDS HIS UNWIELDY MATERIAL TO A PRECONCEIVED VIEW
THAT ARCHITECTURAL CONCEPTION OF WORK WHICH FORESEES THE END IN THE BEGINNING AND NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF IT
AND THE SUBSEQUENT RECONCILIATION OF ISABELLA SO THAT SHE PLEADS SUCCESSFULLY FOR HIS LIFE IT WAS FROM WHETSTONE A CONTEMPORARY ENGLISH WRITER THAT SHAKESPEARE DERIVED THE OUTLINE OF
AS TO IDENTIFY IN PROSE WHAT WE CALL THE POETRY THE IMAGINATIVE POWER NOT TREATING IT AS OUT OF PLACE AND A KIND OF VAGRANT INTRUDER BUT BY WAY OF AN ESTIMATE OF ITS RIGHTS THAT IS
THE FIRST THREE LINES ARE HUGELY HEROIC BUT THE INDIGNATION SOON MELTS AWAY LEAVING AN APATHETIC HUMOR AFTER THE THEME RETURNS AND IS REPEATED WE GET A GENUINE LOVE MOTIF TENDER ENOUGH IN ALL FAITH WHEREWITH TO WOO A PRINCESS

THE LINGERING MENTIONED BY DE LENZ IS TEMPO RUBATO SO FATALLY MISUNDERSTOOD BY MOST CHOPIN PLAYERS DE LENZ IN A NOTE QUOTES MEYERBEER AS SAYING MEYERBEER WHO QUARRELLED WITH CHOPIN ABOUT THE RHYTHM OF A MAZURKA CAN ONE REDUCE WOMEN TO NOTATION
THE PREVAILING MOODS ARE COQUETRY AND SWEET CONTENTMENT CONTRAPUNTAL SKILL IS SHOWN IN THE WORKING OUT SECTION CHOPIN ALWAYS WEARS HIS LEARNING LIGHTLY IT DOES NOT OPPRESS US
GIVE TO THE A FLAT MAJOR POLONAISE THE HONOR OF SUGGESTING A WELL KNOWN STORY IT IS REALLY THE A MAJOR THAT PROVOKED IT SO THE POLISH PORTRAIT PAINTER KWIATOWSKI INFORMED NIECKS THE STORY RUNS THAT AFTER COMPOSING IT
THERE IS LOFTINESS OF SPIRIT AND DARING IN IT WHAT CAN ONE SAY NEW OF THE TREMENDOUS F SHARP MINOR POLONAISE WILLEBY CALLS IT NOISY
A WHIRLWIND I HAVE CALLED IT ELSEWHERE IT IS A STORM OF THE EMOTIONS MUSCULAR IN ITS VIRILITY I REMEMBER DE PACHMANN A CLOSE INTERPRETER OF CERTAIN SIDES OF CHOPIN PLAYING THIS CODA PIANO PIANISSIMO AND PRESTISSIMO
IN E FLAT MINOR IT IS VARIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE SIBERIAN THE REVOLT POLONAISE IT BREATHES DEFIANCE AND RANCOR FROM THE START WHAT SUPPRESSED AND THREATENING RUMBLINGS ARE THERE VOLCANIC MUTTERINGS THESE
AND THERE IS A RUMOR THAT CHOPIN CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR IT XAVER SCHARWENKA MADE A NEW INSTRUMENTATION THAT IS DISCREET AND EXTREMELY WELL SOUNDING WITH EXCELLENT TACT
I HAD TO GO TO BED AT DUSK TILL I MADE A LAMP OF GOAT'S FAT WHICH I PUT IN A CLAY DISH AND THIS
SO NOW I HAD EIGHT MORE ON BOARD MY SHIP THAN I HAD WHEN I FIRST SET OUT IN THREE MONTHS FROM THE TIME WHEN I LEFT HOME I CAME IN SIGHT OF MY ISLE AND I BROUGHT THE SHIP SAFE UP

WHEN ALL AT ONCE I HEARD THE LAD CRY OUT A SHIP WITH A SAIL A SHIP WITH A SAIL
NOW THAT I HAD TWO FREIGHTS OF GOODS AT HAND I MADE A TENT WITH THE SHIP'S SAILS TO STOW THEM IN AND CUT THE POLES FOR IT FROM THE WOOD
AT LENGTH I MET WITH A MAN WHOSE CASE WAS MUCH THE SAME AS MY OWN AND WE BOTH TOOK SOME LAND TO FARM MY STOCK LIKE HIS WAS LOW BUT WE MADE OUR FARMS SERVE TO KEEP US IN FOOD
WHERE HAVE THEY GONE SAID I THERE IN THE WOOD CLOSE BY I FEAR THEY MAY HAVE SEEN AND HEARD US IF THEY HAVE THEY WILL BE SURE TO KILL US ALL HAVE THEY FIRE ARMS THEY HAVE FOUR GUNS ONE OF WHICH IS IN THE BOAT
NOW THOU SHALT DIE THEN I WOKE AND FOUND IT WAS A DREAM WEAK AND FAINT I WAS IN DREAD ALL DAY LEST MY FIT SHOULD COME ON
LORD LOOK ON ME WOULD I CRY FOR HOURS AT LAST THE FIT LEFT ME AND I SLEPT
BUT RAIN FELL ALL THAT NIGHT AND A GREAT PART OF THE NEXT DAY NOW THOUGH QUITE WORN OUT I HAD TO MOVE MY GOODS WHICH WERE IN THE CAVE TO SOME SAFE PLACE

WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS CRUEL THING I SHOT AN ARROW AT A BIRD THAT WAS SITTING ON THE SILL OF AN OPEN WINDOW IN YONDER HOUSE AND MISSED ANSWERED THE PRINCE
THE GIRL PRETENDED TO BE VERY ANGRY WHY HAVE YOU NOT BEEN FOR TWO DAYS SHE ASKED BECAUSE MY DEAR THE OLD WOMAN ANSWERED TWO YOUNG TRAVELLERS
OH SHE CRIED I THOUGHT THAT BOTH OF YOU WOULD BE KILLED BY THIS TIME THE ROYAL ELEPHANTS HAVE GOT LOOSE AND ARE RUNNING ABOUT WILDLY WHEN I HEARD THIS I WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU
CARE YOU NOT WHETHER THEY CURSE ME AND I DIE GO BACK IMMEDIATELY AND AWAIT MY RETURN
LIKE THAT MAN WHO KILLED HIS DOG WHAT MAN WHAT DOG HE ASKED I WILL TELL YOU SAID THE PRINCE IF YOU WILL GIVE ME THAT SWORD SO HE GAVE HIM THE SWORD AND THE PRINCE BEGAN HIS STORY
THE UPPER DECK WAS CLEARED AND THE BOARDERS RUSHED BELOW ON THE MAIN DECK TO COMPLETE THEIR CONQUEST HERE THE SLAUGHTER WAS DREADFUL TILL THE PIRATES CALLED OUT FOR QUARTER AND THE CARNAGE CEASED
AND NOTHING WAS SPARED TO ENTERTAIN AND RENDER HIM AND HIS MEN HAPPY HAVING AMUSED THEMSELVES DURING A WEEK THEY RETURNED TO THE SHIP AND ALLOWED THE OTHER HALF OF THE CREW TO VISIT THE CAPITAL AND ENJOY THEMSELVES IN LIKE MANNER
WHEN TWO PRIVATEERS BEING AT ANCHOR OFF CAT ISLAND A BRITISH SLOOP OF WAR ANCHORED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE PASS AND SENT HER BOATS TO ENDEAVOR TO TAKE THE PRIVATEERS BUT THEY WERE REPULSED WITH CONSIDERABLE LOSS
AND TO GO EVERY MAN ON BOARD THE NEW PRIZE WHEN HIS MEN WERE ON BOARD HER

I DECLARE TO YOU THAT I WILL INSTANTLY LEAVE THE COUNTRY TO AVOID THE IMPUTATION OF HAVING COOPERATED TOWARDS AN INVASION ON THIS POINT WHICH CANNOT FAIL TO TAKE PLACE AND TO REST SECURE IN THE ACQUITTAL OF MY CONSCIENCE

IT WAS SAID TO BE A PORTRAIT OF A MINISTER IN THE TOWN WHO LIVED IN THE LAST CENTURY AND IS STILL REMEMBERED FOR HIS VIRTUES THE SIGHT OF THIS OLD MAN'S FACE COMPLETELY STILLED THE AGITATION OF THE YOUNG MINISTER
INSTEAD OF HEATING IT THERE WAS NO SUCH FUSS WHEN I WAS YOUNG IN THOSE GOOD OLD TIMES THESE AIRY NOTIONS HAD NOT COME INTO FASHION WHERE THE LOOSE WINDOW SASHES RATTLED AT EVERY PASSING BREEZE AND THE WIND CHASED THE SMOKE DOWN THE WIDE MOUTHED CHIMNEY
AND WHEN THE FRONT GATE CLICKED AND THE DOLLIES KNEW THEY WERE ALONE IN THE HOUSE THEY ALL SCRAMBLED TO THEIR FEET
ALL THE DOLLS RAN TO WHERE UNCLE CLEM WAS DOWN ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES THIS MUST BE THE PLACE SAID RAGGEDY ANN
AND OUR LESSON WAS THAT WE MUST NEVER TAKE WITHOUT ASKING
SHE CONTINUED TO SMILE BUT WITH A MORE EXPANSIVE SMILE THAN EVER BEFORE RAGGEDY ANN KNEW JUST HOW IT ALL HAPPENED AND HER REMAINING SHOE BUTTON EYE TWINKLED

RETAIN THE SAME VISITING CARD THAT SHE USED DURING THE LIFETIME OF HER HUSBAND ESPECIALLY IF SHE HAS NO GROWN SON WHO BEARS HIS FATHER'S NAME IN THAT CASE SHE GENERALLY HAS HER CARDS ENGRAVED WITH A PART OF HER FULL MAIDEN NAME
EXCHANGE MEANS FUNDS IN OTHER CITIES MADE AVAILABLE BY BANKERS DRAFTS ON SUCH PLACES THESE DRAFTS AFFORD THE SAFEST AND CHEAPEST MEANS FOR REMITTING MONEY
AND THE MOST POPULAR OF THESE IS A WOMAN'S LUNCH THIS IS A FAVORITE FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT FOR A YOUNG MARRIED WOMAN TO GIVE IN HONOR OF SOME GIRL FRIEND WHO HAS JUST COME OUT IN SOCIETY OR WHOSE ENGAGEMENT HAS JUST BEEN ANNOUNCED ONE O'CLOCK
BANKS USUALLY NOTIFY ALL PAYERS A FEW DAYS BEFOREHAND WHEN THEIR PAPER MATURES BUT THIS IS ONLY COURTESY ON THEIR PART AND NOT AN OBLIGATION EXCHANGE
FATHER FORTUNATELY DISCOVERED THE GREAT REMEDY THAT CURED HIM HE LIVED OVER FORTY YEARS AND NO RETURN OF THE DISEASE THE SAME DISCOVERY HAS NOW THOUSANDS WHO WERE THREATENED WITH OPERATION AND DEATH AND TO PROVE THAT THIS IS THE TRUTH WE WILL GIVE THEIR SWORN STATEMENT IF YOU WILL WRITE US
AND CERTAINLY THE HOSTESS AND HER DAUGHTER SHOULD REMAIN TOGETHER IN A PLACE WHERE THEY MAY BE EASILY FOUND AS THE GUESTS ENTER THE ROOM NO MORE SYMPATHETIC ACT OF FRIENDSHIP CAN BE SHOWN A DEBUTANTE
A LARGE SPRIG OF TIME AND THREE QUARTS OF COOLING WATER OF CONSIDERATION SET THEM OVER A GENTLE FIRE OF LOVE SWEETEN IT WITH SUGAR OF FORGETFULNESS SKIM IT WITH THE SPOON OF MELANCHOLY
IT GIVES QUICK RELIEF TO BURNS IT IS AN EXCELLENT APPLICATION FOR CORNS IT IS GOOD FOR RHEUMATISM AND SORE THROAT AND IT IS THE QUICKEST REMEDY FOR CONVULSIONS OR FITS THEN IT IS A SURE PREVENTIVE AGAINST MOTHS
JUST WHAT I SAY DEAR RESPONDED ANNA WITH DECEPTIVE MEEKNESS POOR GILBERT IS GONE AND I DON'T INTEND TO BOTHER MY HEAD ABOUT HIM ANY LONGER HE WAS AMUSING WHILE HE LASTED BUT OF WHAT USE IS A BEAU TWO THOUSAND MILES AWAY ALMA
PAULINE LAUGHED AGAIN BUT SHE SIGHED AS SHE WENT TO HER ROOM AUNT OLIVIA HAS THE KINDEST HEART IN THE WORLD SHE THOUGHT WHAT A PITY SHE ISN'T ABLE TO SEE THINGS AS THEY REALLY ARE MY FRIENDSHIP WITH ADA CAN'T BE PERFECT IF I CAN'T INVITE HER TO MY HOME
TO LEAD HER INTO DEARER LIGHT ALAN DOUGLAS WAS A SINCERE MAN WITH HIMSELF AS WELL AS WITH OTHERS
IF HIS OBJECT WERE TO PROLONG THE CONVERSATION ABOUT LYNDE HE WAS DISAPPOINTED FOR THE OLD WOMAN HAD TURNED ABRUPTLY TO HER WORK AGAIN AND THOUGH ALAN LINGERED FOR A FEW MOMENTS LONGER SHE TOOK NO FURTHER NOTICE OF HIM
THE TWO GIRLS WERE IN THE EMBREE GARDEN WHERE PAULINE WAS PREPARING TO TAKE A PHOTOGRAPH OF ADA STANDING AMONG THE ASTERS WITH A GREAT SHEAF OF THEM IN HER ARMS
PERHAPS SHE THOUGHT MOURNFULLY THIS PERVERSION OF PROPER FEELING WAS HER PUNISHMENT FOR THE DECEPTION SHE HAD PRACTISED SHE HAD DELIBERATELY DONE EVIL THAT GOOD MIGHT COME
SO STRONG THAT HE KNEW HE MUST GO BACK TO IT SOMETIME MEANWHILE THE GREAT LAKE MIMICKING THE SEA IN ITS VAST EXPANSE AND THE STORMS THAT OFTEN SWEPT OVER IT WAS HIS COMFORT AND SOLACE
SAT QUICKLY UP AS HE ASKED HIS QUESTION DEAR ME YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF CAPTAIN ANTHONY CAPTAIN ANTHONY OLIVER SAID MISSUS DANBY HE LIVES DOWN THERE AT FOUR WINDS AS THEY CALL IT HE AND HIS DAUGHTER AND AN OLD COUSIN
AND IF I CAN ONLY GET THAT COVE WITH ALL ITS BEAUTIFUL LIGHTS AND SHADOWS IT WILL BE THE GEM OF MY COLLECTION
ALMA BALANCED PROS AND CONS ADMITTING THE RISK BUT SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN A TENFOLD LARGER RISK IN THE HOPE OF HOLDING SECURE ANNA'S PLACE IN GILBERT'S AFFECTIONS UNTIL ANNA HERSELF SHOULD COME TO HER SENSES
HIS NAME IS AS BRIGHT IN SCOTLAND AS THOUGH HE HAD LIVED YESTERDAY SONGS AND STORIES ARE TOLD ABOUT HIM THERE AND EVERY SCHOOL BOY HEARS OF HIM AS SOON AS HE IS OLD ENOUGH TO LISTEN TO THE TALES OF HIS COUNTRY
IT WAS ON DRAKE'S FIRST EXPEDITION TO THE WEST INDIES THAT HE CONCEIVED A HATRED FOR THE SPANIARDS THAT WAS TO LAST ALL HIS LIFE AS THE RESULT OF THE BLACK TREACHERY THEY PLAYED ON HAWKINS
WAS A VERSE THAT TOLD DANTE THAT HERE WAS THE ENTRANCE TO THE LOWER WORLD THE GATEWAY TO HELL AND THE VERSE CONCLUDED WITH THE GRIM WORDS ALL HOPE
AND THAT ALL HIS FOLLOWERS MUST WASH THEMSELVES BEFORE THEY PRAYED IN MANY WAYS HOWEVER THE MOHAMMEDAN FAITH WAS NOT SO PURE AS THE CHRISTIAN FAITH FOR THE HEAVEN THAT MOHAMMED BELIEVED IN WAS A PLACE OF FEASTING AND MERRIMENT BUT LITTLE ELSE
AND FURNISHING THEM WITH GUIDES TO HELP THEM TO THE DUTCH FRONTIER WHENCE THEY MIGHT ESCAPE INTO HOLLAND AND RETURN TO ENGLAND THIS WAS THE GERMAN STATEMENT IF WHAT THEY SAID WERE TRUE THERE WAS STILL NO CAUSE FOR KILLING THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN IN THEIR POWER
AND WHEN SHE GREW OLDER TO SIT UP WITH AND CHEER THE SICK AMONG THE COTTAGERS THERE WERE NOT MANY PEOPLE EVEN AMONG THOSE WHO WERE FAR OLDER THAN HERSELF WHO COULD MINISTER TO THE SICK WITH HER KINDNESS AND SKILL
BUT THE STRANGER STRUCK WITH SUCH FORCE THAT NOBODY COULD STAND UP TO HIM AND ALTHOUGH ROBIN PUT UP A LONG AND FURIOUS FIGHT
THE SON OF ALIGHIERO A FLORENTINE WHO WAS POPULAR AND WELL KNOWN AS A MAN OF AFFAIRS WHEN DANTE WAS BORN ITALY WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT IS TO DAY FOR INSTEAD OF BEING FORMED OF A SINGLE NATION
HE BECAME BOTH GLOOMY AND UNHAPPY HIS EXILE MOREOVER WAS A BITTER BLOW TO DANTE FOR HE HAD LOVED FLORENCE DEARLY AND COULD NOT IMAGINE MAKING HIS HOME ELSEWHERE WITH BITTERNESS IN HIS HEART

AT ANOTHER WITH TEETH TO THE GROUND INDUSTRIOUSLY CROPPING THE SWEET GRAMMA GRASS THAT MAKES THE PASTURAGE OF SOUTH WESTERN TEXAS IN MY OPINION THE FINEST IN THE WORLD REJECTING MANY TALES TOLD OF THE HEADLESS HORSEMAN MOST OF THEM TOO GROTESQUE TO BE RECORDED
AH MISTER STUMP GLAD TO SEE YOU SO SOON HAVE YOU MADE ANY DISCOVERY IN THIS QUEER AFFAIR FROM YOUR QUICK RETURN I CAN ALMOST SAY YOU HAVE SOMETHING I HOPE IN FAVOUR OF THIS UNFORTUNATE YOUNG FELLOW
A MORE NAMELESS ADVENTURER WAS TOO MUCH TO BE ENDURED WITH EQUANIMITY EVEN AN ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN PAINED BY THE INFLICTION

FLORINDA NOW THE BETTER HALF OF HIS LIFE HAS EFFECTED THE TRANSFORMATION
FOR ON TURNING SHARPLY MY EYES SUDDENLY DETECTED SOME INDISTINCT OBJECT
THAT RUSSIA WAS NOT PREPARED FOR THE FREEDOM THE NARODNOE PRAVO WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT POSSESS BUT HE ASSURED ME THAT THE TIME FOR AUTOCRACY WAS PAST THAT THE TZAR'S EMPIRE HAD OUTGROWN THE PERIOD OF BENEVOLENT DESPOTISM
AND PLACED IT UPON THE BLOTTING PAD BEFORE ME THE GIRL HE LOVED BAH I KNEW HER THOUGH I DID NOT TELL HIM SO SHE WAS A DARK HAIRED PINK AND WHITE BEAUTY THAT FLITTED THROUGH ARTISTIC BOHEMIA LIKE A BUTTERFLY IN A HOTHOUSE
DEAD HE RETURNED TO PETERSBURG AS SOON AS HIS DAUGHTER HAD LEFT WITH YOU BUT WAS ARRESTED AND PLACED IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IN THE FORTRESS WHILE THERE HE WROTE A CONFESSION OF THE MURDER AND AFTERWARDS COMMITTED SUICIDE AND WILL THEY ARREST PRASCOVIE
THE MORE LIGHT HEARTED SHE BECAME ARRIVING AT LAST AT TOMSK WE REMAINED THERE THREE WEEKS DURING WHICH TIME I VISITED THE KAMERAS OF THE FORWARDING PRISON
OF THE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE GAZED UPON IT IN ADMIRATION NONE KNOWS THE SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE STORY CONNECTED WITH IT AS I HAVE BEEN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH IT FROM THE DAY IT WAS OUTLINED IN CHARCOAL
THE PRINCE NOT BEING GOVERNOR OF THE PROVINCE IN WHICH HIS WIFE WAS IMPRISONED
TOWARDS THE SHADY WOOD A FILM GATHERS IN MY EYES AND I AM CARRIED BACK INTO THE TERRIBLE PAST TO THOSE BLACK FATEFUL DAYS WHEN FRANCE LAY HELPLESS UNDER THE IRON HEEL OF THE INVADER
AND THE MANNER IN WHICH HE ADMINISTERED IT WAS SOMEWHAT NOVEL HE PREPARED TO RECEIVE HIS ENEMY BY ALLOWING THE NAIL OF THE FOREFINGER OF HIS RIGHT HAND TO GROW LONG AFTERWARDS THINNING IT TO A POINT AS FINE AS A NEEDLE
