THAT'S BECAUSE HE THINKS SMOKING WOULD STOP HIS GROWTH AND INTERFERE WITH HIS CRICKET ANSWERED MARY HE WOULD SMOKE IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT THAT'S GIVING HIM HIGH PRAISE THEN SAID RANSFORD YOU COULDN'T GIVE HIM HIGHER
THIS IS A LONG WAY FROM WRYCHESTER SIR FOR WRYCHESTER FOLK TO MEET IN I'D NO IDEA OF MEETING YOU MISTER HARKER RESPONDED BRYCE BUT IT'S A SMALL WORLD YOU KNOW AND THERE ARE A GOOD MANY COINCIDENCES IN IT
EACH WAS UNDENIABLY GOOD LOOKING AND EMINENTLY HEALTHY NO ONE WOULD HAVE DOUBTED THAT BOTH HAD LIVED A GOOD DEAL OF AN OPEN AIR EXISTENCE THE BOY WAS ALREADY MUSCULAR AND SINEWY
HE SAID THAT HE SHOULD SETTLE DOWN FOR A TIME AT SOME RESIDENTIAL HOTEL IN LONDON AND IN THE MEANTIME HE HAD ONE OR TWO CALLS OR VISITS TO MAKE IN THE COUNTRY WHEN HE RETURNED FROM THEM HE SAID HE WOULD CALL ON ME AGAIN HE GAVE ME VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT HIMSELF
AND THOSE WHO MET HER WONDERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MAKE THE SWEET LITTLE MAID SO ANXIOUS BUT THERE IS AN END TO ALL TROUBLES NO MATTER HOW SEVERE THEY MAY SEEM TO BE AND IT HAPPENED ONE DAY AS BO PEEP DID STRAY UNTO A MEADOW HARD BY
THE SHOCK OF THIS ANSWER WAS SO GREAT THAT THE SCHOOLMASTER FAINTED AWAY AND WHEN THEY HAD BROUGHT HIM TO HE MADE A PROPHECY THAT SOLOMON WOULD GROW UP TO BE A WOND'ROUS WISE MAN
OF COURSE I CONSENTED FOR WE ALL LIKE TO PLEASE OLD SANTA AND A MINUTE LATER I HAD JUMPED INTO THE SLEIGH BESIDE HIM AND WE WERE DASHING AWAY AT FULL SPEED TOWARD HIS CASTLE I ENJOYED THE RIDE VERY MUCH BUT I ENJOYED THE CASTLE FAR MORE
THE ROOMS ARE BIG AND HIGH AND THERE IS A SOFT CARPET UPON EVERY FLOOR AND MANY STRANGE THINGS SCATTERED AROUND TO AMUSE ONE SANTA CLAUS LIVES THERE ALL ALONE EXCEPT FOR OLD MOTHER HUBBARD WHO COOKS THE MEALS FOR HIM
IF I PUT IT OFF ANY LONGER IT WILL BE TOO LATE I'M GROWING SO FAST AUNT OLIVIA SAYS I'LL HAVE TO WEAR ANKLE SKIRTS NEXT SUMMER IF I BEGIN TO LOOK GROWN UP HE'LL GET FRIGHTENED OF ME AND THEN I'LL NEVER FIND OUT THE GOLDEN MILESTONE MYSTERY
FELICITY IF I DIE FROM THE EFFECTS OF EATING SAWDUST PUDDING FLAVOURED WITH NEEDLES YOU'LL BE SORRY YOU EVER SAID SUCH A THING TO YOUR POOR OLD UNCLE SAID UNCLE ROGER REPROACHFULLY EVEN IF THERE WERE NO NEEDLES IN IT
HOW ON EARTH DID YOU MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE IT LOOKED JUST LIKE CORNMEAL SAID THE STORY GIRL GOING FROM WHITE TO RED IN HER SHAME WELL I'M GOING TO GIVE UP TRYING TO COOK AND STICK TO THINGS I CAN DO
AND IN HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE SHE DEEMED THAT SHE HAD A RIGHT TO RULE SUPREME SHE KNEW BETTER THAN TO MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO ASSERT AUTHORITY OVER THE STORY GIRL AND FELIX AND I WERE ALLOWED SOME LENGTH OF TETHER BUT CECILY DAN AND PETER WERE EXPECTED TO SUBMIT
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR A HORRIBLE FEAR WHICH FLASHED INTO HER MIND THAT POSSIBLY SAWDUST PUDDINGS WERE NOT HEALTHY FOR PEOPLE TO EAT
DON'T GIVE MISTER MALLINSON ANY MORE WINE SAID CRUTTENDON FAIR PLAY FAIR PLAY SAID JACOB JUDICIALLY LET A MAN GET DRUNK IF HE LIKES THAT'S SHAKESPEARE CRUTTENDON I'M WITH YOU THERE
WERE YOU THERE WHEN THEY ACTED MISTER WORTLEY'S PLAY OH NO OF COURSE NOT AT THE LAST MOMENT DID YOU HEAR YOU HAD TO GO TO JOIN YOUR MOTHER I REMEMBER AT HARROGATE AT THE LAST MOMENT AS I WAS SAYING JUST AS EVERYTHING WAS READY THE CLOTHES FINISHED AND EVERYTHING
MORE HORSES LEGS HAVE BEEN WORN OUT MORE COACHMEN'S LIVES CONSUMED MORE HOURS OF SOUND AFTERNOON TIME VAINLY LAVISHED THAN SERVED TO WIN US THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AND PAY FOR IT INTO THE BARGAIN
YOU NEEDN'T REPEAT THE WHOLE DAMNED THING OVER AGAIN CRUTTENDON SAID MALLINSON THE LITTLE BALD PAINTER WHO WAS SITTING AT A MARBLE TABLE SPLASHED WITH COFFEE AND RINGED WITH WINE TALKING VERY FAST
THEN IN HER TERROR THE PRINCESS GREW ANGRY AND SAYING TO HERSELF SHE MUST BE SOMEWHERE IN THE PLACE ELSE WHO WAS THERE TO OPEN THE DOOR TO ME
SHUT THE DOOR AND LEFT HER ALONE ROSAMOND WAS SOBBING SO THAT SHE DID NOT HEAR HER GO WHEN AT LENGTH SHE LOOKED UP AND SAW THAT THE WISE WOMAN WAS GONE HER MISERY RETURNED AFRESH AND TENFOLD AND SHE WEPT AND WAILED
IF I WERE BUT IN THIS GOOD KIND LOVING GENEROUS KING'S PALACE I SHOULD SOON BE SUCH A GREAT LADY AS THEY NEVER SAW THEN THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT A GOOD LITTLE GIRL I HAD ALWAYS BEEN
WITH HER LAP FULL OF FLOWERS OF ALL COLORS BUT OF SUCH KINDS AS ROSAMOND HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SHE WAS PLAYING WITH THEM BURYING HER HANDS IN THEM TUMBLING THEM ABOUT AND EVERY NOW AND THEN PICKING ONE FROM THE REST AND THROWING IT AWAY
IT FOLLOWS THAT FOR US MEN IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN HOW AND WHY THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE MAXIM AS A LAW THAT IS MORALITY INTERESTS THIS ONLY IS CERTAIN THAT IT IS NOT BECAUSE IT INTERESTS US THAT IT HAS VALIDITY FOR US FOR
IN CONTRAST WITH EVERY OTHER WHICH I ACCORDINGLY RECKON AS HETERONOMY THE CONCEPTION OF THE WILL OF EVERY RATIONAL BEING AS ONE WHICH MUST CONSIDER ITSELF AS GIVING IN ALL THE MAXIMS OF ITS WILL
RATIONAL NATURE IS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE REST OF NATURE BY THIS THAT IT SETS BEFORE ITSELF AN END THIS END WOULD BE THE MATTER OF EVERY GOOD WILL BUT SINCE IN THE IDEA OF A WILL
IN WHICH WE SHOW OUR OWN ACTIVITY THEN IT FOLLOWS OF ITSELF THAT WE MUST ADMIT AND ASSUME BEHIND THE APPEARANCE SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS NOT AN APPEARANCE NAMELY THE THINGS IN THEMSELVES ALTHOUGH WE MUST ADMIT THAT AS THEY CAN NEVER BE KNOWN TO US EXCEPT AS THEY AFFECT US
GRACE WAS READY TO START FOR SCHOOL WHEN SYLVIA AND ESTRALLA ARRIVED AND HER MOTHER GAVE HER CONSENT AT ONCE FOR HER TO GO SAILING IN THE AFTERNOON THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS WILL SOON BE HERE SO A HALF DAY OUT OF SCHOOL WILL NOT MATTER MISSUS WAITE SAID SMILINGLY
BUT ON THIS MORNING IN EARLY OCTOBER THEY WERE ALLOWED TO GO BY THEMSELVES AS THEY WALKED ALONG THEY COULD LOOK OUT ACROSS THE BLUE HARBOR AND SEE SAILING VESSELS AND ROWBOATS COMING AND GOING IN THE DISTANCE WERE THE THREE FORTS WHOSE HISTORIC NAMES WERE KNOWN TO EVERY CHILD IN CHARLESTON
GRACE LOOKED ALL ABOUT THE ROOM AND THEN CLOSED THE DOOR NOT SEEING A LITTLE FIGURE CROUCHING IN A SHADOWY CORNER I WOULDN'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE TO HEAR IT'S ABOUT THE GHOST SHE WHISPERED I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT
SHE KNEW OF NO REASON WHY THESE GIRLS SHOULD TREAT HER IN SO UNKIND A FASHION SHE FELT VERY DESOLATE AND UNHAPPY BUT SHE FACED THEM BRAVELY YANKEES YANKEES IT'S WHAT ALL AMERICANS ARE SHE DECLARED DEFIANTLY
THOU DIDST ATTACK WITHOUT PROVOCATION THY LIFE IS FORFEIT AND AS MANY MORE AS MAY BE FOUND NEEDFUL TO GUARANTEE PEACE THEN I QUOTH MY MANNER CHANGING
WE COVERED HIM WITH QUICKLIME AND SOME EARTH AS SOON AS WE HAD TAKEN CARE OF THOSE WHO WERE NOT TOO FAR GONE I CALLED THE MEN TOGETHER AND CAUSED A ROUND OF SPIRITS TO BE SERVED
IN TRUTH WE WOULD HAVE ALL BEEN LOST HAD WE COME IN THE MANNER OF FORMER CAMPAIGNS ALL TOGETHER IN BIG TRANSPORTS BUT BECAUSE WE COULD SCATTER EVERY WHICH WAY
KLOW LOOKED AT ME WITH A PECULIAR EXPRESSION AS THOUGH HE THOUGHT ME MAD TRUE IT LOOKED IT HOW COULD I DO HIM HARM WITHOUT MYSELF SUFFERING BUT I KICKED THE PROPS WHICH HELD THE IRON
SLOW THE ENDLESS NIGHT COMES ON AND LATE TO FULNESS GROWS THE BIRTH THAT SHALL LAST AS LONG AS EARTH WANDERERS EASTWARD WANDERERS WEST
AND LIGHT ON ME MY TROUBLE LAY AND I SLEPT OUT IN FLESH AND BONE MANFUL LIKE THE MAN OF STONE
IF YOUNG HEARTS WERE NOT SO CLEVER OH THEY WOULD BE YOUNG FOR EVER THINK NO MORE TIS ONLY THINKING LAYS LADS UNDERGROUND
BE STILL MY SOUL BE STILL THE ARMS YOU BEAR ARE BRITTLE EARTH AND HIGH HEAVEN ARE FIXT OF OLD AND FOUNDED STRONG THINK RATHER CALL TO THOUGHT IF NOW YOU GRIEVE A LITTLE THE DAYS WHEN WE HAD REST O SOUL FOR THEY WERE LONG
BY VALLEY GUARDED GRANGES AND SILVER WATERS WIDE CONTENT AT HEART I FOLLOWED WITH MY DELIGHTFUL GUIDE AND LIKE THE CLOUDY SHADOWS ACROSS THE COUNTRY BLOWN
IN THE MORNING TOO ANNE WILL WALK WITH HIM TO THE END OF THE ROAD
WILL BE DECLINED SAY COME AND LOOK AT THE POND AND THE WORST SLUGGARD WILL NOT REFUSE SUCH GENTLE EXERCISE AND ONCE HE IS OUT HE IS OUT
THE FRIEND OF MAN WHEN SWORDS WENT OUT OF FASHION WALKING STICKS I SUPPOSE CAME INTO FASHION THE PRESENT CUSTOM HAS ITS ADVANTAGES EVEN IN HIS BUSIEST DAY THE HERO'S SWORD MUST HAVE RETURNED AT TIMES TO ITS SCABBARD
AFTERWARDS WORKED TILL FIVE AND HAD MY HAIR CUT ON THE WAY HOME AFTER DINNER READ A MAN'S PASSION BY THEODORA POPGOOD ROTTEN WENT TO BED AT ELEVEN TUESDAY HAD A LETTER FROM JANE
FOR WITH SUCH THINGS ALSO WE HAVE IMMEDIATE ACQUAINTANCE AT THE MOMENT OF REMEMBERING OR IMAGINING ALL SUCH IMMEDIATE DATA HE CALLS IDEAS HE THEN PROCEEDS TO CONSIDER COMMON OBJECTS SUCH AS A TREE FOR INSTANCE
BECAUSE THE GENERAL PROPOSITION TWO AND TWO ARE FOUR NEVER TOLD US THERE WERE SUCH PEOPLE AS BROWN AND JONES AND ROBINSON AND SMITH AND THE PARTICULAR PREMISSES DO NOT TELL US THAT THERE WERE FOUR OF THEM WHEREAS THE PARTICULAR PROPOSITION DEDUCED DOES TELL US BOTH THESE THINGS
BUT BELIEVING PLAINLY IS NOT A RELATION WHICH OTHELLO HAS TO EACH OF THE THREE TERMS CONCERNED BUT TO ALL OF THEM TOGETHER THERE IS ONLY ONE EXAMPLE OF THE RELATION OF BELIEVING INVOLVED BUT THIS ONE EXAMPLE KNITS TOGETHER FOUR TERMS
THE REFERENCE TO THE FUTURE IN THIS QUESTION IS NOT ESSENTIAL THE SAME QUESTION ARISES WHEN WE APPLY THE LAWS THAT WORK IN OUR EXPERIENCE TO PAST THINGS OF WHICH WE HAVE NO EXPERIENCE AS FOR EXAMPLE IN GEOLOGY OR IN THEORIES AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM
DREAMILY FIXED OUT THE WINDOW NODDED HER HEAD SLOWLY YES I S'POSE SO BUT THERE'S A LOT LEFT THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT LEFT AND EVERYTHING HE WRITES I CAN JUST SEE IT WAS ALWAYS LIKE THAT WITH MY JOHN
WHEN DANIEL BURTON THIS MORNING THEREFORE HEARD SUSAN SINGING THIS SONG HE WAS IN NO DOUBT AS TO SUSAN'S STATE OF MIND A FACT WHICH CERTAINLY DID NOT ADD TO HIS OWN SERENITY UPSTAIRS KEITH
WHY MISTER BURTON WHAT DO YOU MEAN IS KEITH WORSE CHATTERED SUSAN WITH DRY LIPS IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE HASH I TOOK UP HE SIMPLY WON'T EAT THAT OATMEAL STUFF AN' NO NO I DON'T MEAN THE HASH
SHE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN KEITH'S FRENZIED AVOIDANCE OF SUCH CALLERS IN THE OLD DAYS BUT TO HER SURPRISE NOW KEITH WELCOMED MAZIE JOYOUSLY SO JOYOUSLY THAT SUSAN BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT BEHIND THE JOYOUSNESS
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WHEN WE LEFT CEDARVILLE IN SUCH A HURRY I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW THINGS ARE GOING UP THERE MUSED DICK IT WILL BE TOO BAD IF JOSIAH CRABTREE SUCCEEDS IN MARRYING MISSUS STANHOPE WHILE WE ARE AWAY
A BOAT IS DEAD AHEAD CAME SUDDENLY FROM DICK AND SERGEANT BROWN ALSO GAVE A CRY OF WARNING THEN CAME A SHOCK AND A CRASH AND A SPLINTERING OF WOOD FOLLOWED BY THE CRIES OF MEN AND BOYS AND THE SCREAMS OF A WOMAN AND A GIRL
PUT IN SAM THEY COULDN'T HAVE SPIRITED HIM AWAY HE CAN'T BE FAR OFF SAID FRANK AGAIN WAS THE SEARCH RENEWED THE MEN HAD HAD ONE LARGE ROOM AND ONE SMALL APARTMENT
THEY HAVE SKIPPED FOR GOOD TAKE MY WORD ON IT MUTTERED TOM AND THE OTHERS AGREED WITH HIM
SO SAD SO DEEP AND SO DOLEFUL THAT SHE PUT ALL WHO HEARD AND SAW HER INTO A STATE OF PERPLEXITY
WERE WATCHING HIM AND AS THEY SAW HIM THERE WITH HALF A YARD OF NECK AND THAT UNCOMMONLY BROWN HIS EYES SHUT AND HIS BEARD FULL OF SOAP IT WAS A GREAT WONDER AND ONLY BY GREAT DISCRETION THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO RESTRAIN THEIR LAUGHTER THE DAMSELS THE CONCOCTERS OF THE JOKE
I GAVE YOU AN ACCOUNT OF THE INJUSTICE AND TREACHERY OF A WICKED FARMER TO MY DEARLY BELOVED DAUGHTER THE UNHAPPY DAMSEL HERE BEFORE YOU AND YOU PROMISED ME TO TAKE HER PART AND RIGHT THE WRONG THAT HAS BEEN DONE HER
THAN TOUCHED THE THRACIAN STRING BUT NOT IN LIFE ALONE METHINKS TO ME BELONGS THE OFFICE LADY WHEN MY TONGUE IS COLD IN DEATH BELIEVE ME UNTO THEE MY VOICE SHALL RAISE ITS TRIBUTARY SONG
IF SO BE YOUR WORSHIP IS GOING OUR ROAD AND HAS NO OCCASION FOR SPEED IT WOULD BE A PLEASURE TO ME IF WE WERE TO JOIN COMPANY IN TRUTH REPLIED HE ON THE MARE
DURING THE EATING OF WHICH THE TWO MEN BECAME PRETTY FRIENDLY YOU'RE DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF THE FOLKS OF YOUR STATION REBLONG FINALLY MADE BOLD TO REMARK ANY HARM IN MY SAYING SO ON THE CONTRARY LAUGHED THE ATHLETE
I ADMIT THEM ALL AND AT THE SAME TIME I WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ACCOMPLISHED ALL THIS NOT PRIMARILY FOR OUR BENEFIT BUT IN THE INTERESTS OF THE OWNERS THEY GAVE US PROHIBITION BECAUSE DRINKING WAS BAD FOR BUSINESS
TWENTY FIVE HOUR DIAL AND A PENDULUM OF THE USUAL LENGTH SAME AS YOURS
WITHIN A WEEK I SHALL KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE CREW BY WIRELESS AND ADVISE YOU OF THEIR PROGRESS FROM TIME TO TIME
BUT SHE MUST TAKE CARE THAT FOOLISH EXTRAVAGANT CURATE SHOULD NOT COME NEAR HIM THERE WAS NO KNOWING TO WHAT HE MIGHT PERSUADE HIM POOR POLDIE WAS SO EASILY LED BY ANY SHOW OF NOBILITY ANYTHING THAT LOOKED GRAND OR SELF SACRIFICING
CHAPTER FOUR THEIR TALK DURING DINNER BASCOMBE HAD THE TALK MOSTLY TO HIMSELF AND RATTLED WELL OCCASIONALLY REBUKED BY HIS AUNT FOR SOME REMARK WHICH MIGHT
BUT GOD KNOWS ABOUT US ALL THE SAME AND HE DON'T LIMIT HIS GOODNESS TO US BY OUR KNOWLEDGE OF HIM IT'S SO WONDERFUL
EVERY ONE OF WHICH NATURE FITS FOR A QUEEN BUT ITS NURSES PREVENT FROM GROWING ONE BY PROVIDING FOR IT A CELL TOO NARROW FOR THE UNROLLING OF ROYALTY
AND TO THE SWEET CONTAGION OF HER TASTE DO I OWE THAT LOVE OF TRUE GLORY WHICH CARRIES ME TO THE SIDE OF SIR WILLIAM WALLACE THE VIRTUOUS ONLY CAN AWAKEN ANY INTEREST IN HER HEART
AND REMEMBER THAT GOD NOT ONLY ARMETH THE PATRIOT'S HAND BUT SHIELDETH HIS HEART IN THIS FAITH BE YE THE BUCKLERS WHICH HEAVEN SENDS TO GUARD THE LIFE OF WALLACE AND SO HONORED EXULT IN YOUR STATION AND EXPECT THE FUTURE GRATITUDE OF SCOTLAND
HE TRAVERSED THE ADJOINING COUNTRY STRIVING TO ENLIGHTEN THE UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE STUPIDLY SATISFIED AND TO EXCITE THE DISCONTENTED TO REVOLT WITH MOST HE FAILED
OUR MOUNTAINS ARE HIS SEAL PLAINS ARE THE PROPER TERRITORIES OF TYRANNY THERE THE ARMIES OF A USURPER MAY EXTEND THEMSELVES WITH EASE LEAVING NO CORNER UNOCCUPIED IN WHICH PATRIOTISM MIGHT SHELTER OR TREASON HIDE
SO THAT THE COMPARISON IS LUMINOUS IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE I DO NOT THINK THAT IN THE SPECIAL SCHEME WHICH THE NOVELIST SET HIMSELF HERE HE CAN BE ACCUSED OF ANY FAILURE THE LIFE IS AS VIVID AS EVER
TO PUT WHAT I MEAN OUT OF REACH OF CAVIL COMPARE IMOGEN AND AMELIA AND THE DIFFERENCE WILL BE FELT BUT FIELDING WAS A PROSE WRITER WRITING IN LONDON IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WHILE SHAKESPEARE WAS A POET WRITING IN ALL TIME AND ALL SPACE
I WAS HURT WITH PERCEIVING SO MUCH MALICE IN HUMAN SHAPE AND CRIED OUT VERY BLUNTLY INDEED LADIES YOU NEED NOT EXPRESS SUCH SATISFACTION AT POOR MISS EMILY'S ACCIDENT FOR SHE WILL STILL BE THE HANDSOMEST WOMAN IN ENGLAND
I SCORN TO RAP FOOTNOTE A CANT WORD MEANING TO SWEAR OR RATHER TO PERJURE YOURSELF AGAINST ANY LADY D N ME MADAM CRIED ANOTHER FEMALE I HONOUR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE I ONCE PUT A KNIFE INTO A CULL MYSELF
TO MAKE HER HAPPY IN SOME HONEST FELLOW OF HER OWN DEGREE AND THAT WILL BE DOING SOMETHING AND WILL ALSO OBLIGE AND PACIFY YOUR MUCH GRIEVED SISTER IF I HAVE WRITTEN TOO SHARPLY CONSIDER IT IS MY LOVE TO YOU AND THE SHAME YOU ARE BRINGING UPON YOURSELF
MEAN TIME SHE HUMBLE HERSELF AND ASK THIS AS A FAVOUR AND IS SORRY FOR HER PERTNESS AND THE LIBERTY SHE HAS TAKEN WITH MY CHARACTER OUT OF THE HOUSE AND IN THE HOUSE YOUR HONOUR INDEED TOLD ME SO SAID MISSUS JERVIS
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE MISSUS JEWKES SAID HE HAD A FEVERISH COMPLAINT AND HAD BEEN BLOODED AND VERY PRUDENTLY ORDERED ABRAHAM WHEN HE AWAKED NOT TO TELL HIM I WAS COME FOR FEAR OF SURPRISING HIM AND AUGMENTING HIS FEVER
THE LATTER HERE IN GREAT FORM GAVE ME BEFORE ROBIN THE LETTER WHICH I HAD GIVEN HIM BACK FOR THAT PURPOSE AND I RETIRED AS IF TO READ IT AND SO I DID FOR I THINK I CAN'T READ IT TOO OFTEN THOUGH FOR MY PEACE OF MIND'S SAKE I MIGHT BETTER TRY TO FORGET IT
SOUGHT TO SOFTEN MY SORROW BY HONORING THE FUNERAL CEREMONY WITH THEIR PRESENCE AND AT THE TERMINATION OF THE CEREMONY I WAS LOWERED INTO THE PIT
HE WRAPPED SOME UP IN THE SKIRTS OF HIS VEST AND CRAMMED HIS BOSOM AS FULL AS IT COULD HOLD ALADDIN HAVING THUS LOADED HIMSELF WITH RICHES OF WHICH HE KNEW NOT THE VALUE
WHAT LITTLE WIND THERE WAS BLEW ME TOWARDS THE LAND AND THUS HAVING FOUND TWO OR THREE BROKEN OARS BELONGING TO THE BOAT AND BESIDES THE TOOLS WHICH WERE IN THE CHEST I FOUND TWO SAWS AN AXE AND A HAMMER WITH THIS CARGO I PUT TO SEA
LAYING MY TWO PISTOLS JUST AT MY HEAD AND MY GUN AT LENGTH BY ME I WENT TO BED FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SLEPT VERY QUIETLY ALL NIGHT
BEING VERY FAITHFULLY SECONDED BY THEIR MEN THEY SECURED ALL THE REST THAT WERE UPON THE MAIN AND QUARTER DECKS AND BEGAN TO FASTEN THE HATCHES TO KEEP THEM DOWN THAT WERE BELOW WHEN THE OTHER BOAT AND THEIR MEN ENTERING AT THE FORECHAINS
IT WAS PROPOSED TO SELECT SOME PARTICULAR DAY WHEN THE ECONOMIC ATMOSPHERE WAS DISTINCTLY EQUABLE AND TO DECLARE
SHE WORE A WOMANLY DRESS OF GREYISH GREEN PROBABLY UNDER THE LESSER RULE
AND I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE UNTEMPERED HERE IS A WORLD AND A GLORIOUS WORLD AND IT IS FOR ME TO TAKE HOLD OF IT TO HAVE TO DO WITH IT HERE AND NOW AND BEHOLD I CAN ONLY THINK THAT I AM BURNT AND SCARRED AND THERE RANKLES THAT WRETCHED PIECE OF BUSINESS
IT MAY BE THESE GREAT GENTLEMEN
NO LUCY I MUST OBEY MY FATHER ELSIE ANSWERED IN A VERY PLEASANT BUT NO LESS DECIDED TONE SOME ONE CAUGHT HER ROUND THE WAIST AND LIFTED HER UP OH PAPA SHE EXCLAIMED I DID NOT KNOW YOU WERE THERE
SAYING TO THE ELDER MISTER DINSMORE THAT HE WAS GOING TO RIDE OVER TO ION AND WOULD PROBABLY NOT RETURN BEFORE NIGHT THEN WITH A SIGH THE LITTLE GIRL WENT BACK TO HER OWN ROOM TO PREPARE HER MORNING LESSONS
AND DRAWING THE MINIATURE FROM HER BOSOM BUT AS HE TOUCHED THE SPRING THE CASE FLEW OPEN REVEALING THE SWEET GIRLISH FACE IT NEEDED NOT ELSIE'S LOW MURMURED MAMMA TO TELL HIM WHO THAT LOVELY LADY WAS
AND HALF HOPING THAT HE WOULD SEND FOR HER WHEN THEY HAD GONE SHE WATCHED THE CLOCK AND LISTENED INTENTLY FOR EVERY SOUND BUT HER BEDTIME CAME AND SHE DARED NOT STAY UP ANY LONGER FOR HIS ORDERS HAD BEEN PEREMPTORY THAT SHE SHOULD ALWAYS RETIRE PRECISELY AT THAT HOUR
HE GAZED UPON IT WITH EMOTION CARRIED BACK IN MEMORY TO THE TIME WHEN FOR A FEW SHORT MONTHS SHE HAD BEEN HIS OWN MOST CHERISHED TREASURE THEN LOOKING FROM IT TO HIS CHILD HE MURMURED YES SHE IS VERY LIKE THE SAME FEATURES
IT IS SO I BELIEVE REPLIED EDWARD YES NOW THAT EDITH SMILES I'M SURE IT IS THEM YES REPLIED GRENVILLE
I SEE NO REASON TO THE CONTRARY WELL THEN THAT IS SETTLED AND I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR ACCOMMODATION PATIENCE AND CLARA ARE IN THE NEXT ROOM YOU CAN JOIN THEM AND YOU WILL MAKE MY DAUGHTER VERY HAPPY
WHICH HAS BEEN SO LONG HELD BY OTHERS
LET HER FATHER BUT GIVE ME HER AND ARNWOOD WILL BE BUT A TRIFLE IN ADDITION WITH RESPECT TO THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH YOU ARE TO POSSESS ARNWOOD SAID HUMPHREY I CAN INFORM YOU WHAT THEY ARE
BUT YOU'VE DONE WHAT YOU COULD TO MAKE THINGS A BIT EVEN SHAKE HANDS WI ME AGAIN MY LAD BEFORE I GO AWAY FROM YOU THE FATHER AND SON CLASPED HANDS
THIS NEW EXPERIENCE WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO HER SO AGREEABLE THAT IT ALMOST EFFACED HER PREVIOUS EMOTION ABOUT PHILIP THERE WAS A NEW BRIGHTNESS IN HER EYES AND A VERY BECOMING FLUSH ON HER CHEEK AS SHE SEATED HERSELF
OH MY BUTTONS I WISH I COULD DRAW LIKE THAT I'M TO LEARN DRAWING THIS HALF I WONDER IF I SHALL LEARN TO MAKE DOGS AND DONKEYS OH YOU CAN DO THEM WITHOUT LEARNING SAID PHILIP I NEVER LEARNED DRAWING
PHILIP WAS AT ONCE TOO PROUD AND TOO TIMID TO WALK TOWARD TOM HE THOUGHT OR RATHER FELT THAT TOM HAD AN AVERSION TO LOOKING AT HIM EVERY ONE ALMOST DISLIKED LOOKING AT HIM
SO THE DRAKEN RETURNED TO THE SPRING AWOKE LAZARUS AND SAID THAT IF IT WAS AGREEABLE TO HIM THEY SHOULD MAKE FELLOWSHIP TOGETHER LAZARUS ANSWERED THAT HE WAS WILLING
AFTER SOME TALK IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE RABBIT SHOULD BE LEFT IN CHARGE THEN ALL THE OTHER BEASTS WENT BACK TO THEIR HOMES
ALL THAT DAY THINGS WENT ON EXACTLY AS THEY HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE AFTER SUPPER THE WIZARD BROUGHT BACK THE PRINCESS AND LOOKING HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYES HE SAID WE SHALL SEE WHICH OF US TWO WILL GAIN THE PRIZE AFTER ALL
HE SEATED HIMSELF BY HER AND DETERMINED NOT TO CLOSE HIS EYES THAT NIGHT FOR FEAR SHE SHOULD ESCAPE HIM AND IN ORDER THAT SHE SHOULD BE DOUBLY GUARDED LONG STRETCHED HIMSELF LIKE A STRAP ALL ROUND THE ROOM
IN THAT THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF CROSS COUNTER WORK PEOPLE CAME IN FAIRLY FREQUENTLY TO CASH CHEQUES OF TWO OR THREE POUNDS BUT IT WAS RARE THAT ANY VERY LARGE DEALINGS TOOK PLACE HAVING COMPLETED HIS BUSINESS WITH THE INWARD BILLS
THE CRY HAS GONE ROUND THE WALLER HOUSEHOLD JACKSON AND PSMITH ARE COMING TO SUPPER AND WE CANNOT DISAPPOINT THEM NOW ALREADY THE FATTED BLANC MANGE HAS BEEN KILLED AND THE TABLE CREAKS BENEATH WHAT'S LEFT OF THE MIDDAY BEEF
HOW PLEASANT HE SAID AFTER STRIFE IS REST WE SHOULDN'T HAVE APPRECIATED THIS SIMPLE CUP OF TEA HAD OUR SENSIBILITIES REMAINED UNSTIRRED THIS AFTERNOON
THE WORK WAS EASY AND WHEN HE DID HAPPEN TO MAKE MISTAKES THEY WERE CORRECTED PATIENTLY BY THE GREY BEARDED ONE AND NOT USED AS LEVERS FOR BOOSTING HIM INTO THE PRESENCE OF MISTER BICKERSDYKE AS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN SOME DEPARTMENTS THE CASHIER SEEMED TO HAVE TAKEN A FANCY TO MIKE
PSMITH AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TABLE BEAMED IN A FATHERLY MANNER UPON THE PAIR THROUGH HIS EYEGLASS MIKE GOT ON WITH SMALL GIRLS REASONABLY WELL HE PREFERRED THEM AT A DISTANCE BUT IF CORNERED BY THEM COULD PUT UP A FAIRLY GOOD SHOW SMALL BOYS HOWEVER FILLED HIM WITH A SORT OF FROZEN HORROR
DO NOT WAIT TILL WAR AND FAMINE HAVE DESTROYED US TO THE LAST MAN WE ARE IN YOUR HANDS DEATH HAS TAKEN FROM YOU MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND OF US IF YOU WAIT LONGER NOT ONE WILL REMAIN ALIVE AND THEN YOU WILL BE SORRY THAT YOU DID NOT SAVE THOSE
THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN WERE THEIR SEASONS OF SERIOUS EMPLOYMENT OF WAR HUNTING FISHING AND TRADE THERE WAS AN ESTABLISHED SYSTEM OF TRAFFIC
THIS CALAMITY WAS FOUR YEARS AFTER FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER WHEN THE BEST OF THE HURON WARRIORS INCLUDING THEIR LEADER THE CRAFTY AND VALIANT ETIENNE ANNAOTAHA WERE SLAIN
BUT HE REPLIED THAT THERE WERE OLDER AND WISER MEN AMONG THE HURONS WHOSE COUNSELS ALL THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED AND THAT THEY OUGHT TO LAY THE PROPOSAL BEFORE THEM HE PROCEEDED TO ADVISE THEM TO KEEP HIM AS A HOSTAGE AND SEND OVER HIS COMPANIONS WITH SOME OF THEIR CHIEFS
NOW IF I SAVE YOUR LIFE THERE ARE TWO THINGS WHICH YOU MUST DO BUT HE READ MY THOUGHTS AND SAID IF YOU SAVE MY LIFE YOU SHALL DO AS YOU LIKE WITH ME AND MY SHIP AND TAKE HER WHERE YOU PLEASE I SAW THAT THE TWO MEN IN WHOSE CHARGE THE BOAT HAD BEEN LEFT
THE HEART OF EACH NOW GREW FAINT OUR CHEEKS WERE PALE AND OUR EYES WERE DIM FOR THERE WAS BUT ONE HOPE AND THAT WAS TO FIND SOME BAY AND SO GET IN THE LEE OF THE LAND
AND THESE I PUT ON THE RAFT WHEN THE HIGH TIDE CAME UP IT TOOK OFF MY COAT AND SHIRT WHICH I HAD LEFT ON THE SHORE BUT THERE WERE SOME FRESH CLOTHES IN THE SHIP
I SAW THAT THERE WERE BIRDS ON THE ISLE AND I SHOT ONE OF THEM MINE MUST HAVE BEEN THE FIRST GUN THAT HAD BEEN HEARD THERE SINCE THE WORLD WAS MADE FOR AT THE SOUND OF IT
AND HEARD THE SOUNDS OF MEN NOT OF ONE OR TWO BUT OF A GREAT CROWD WE NEED NOT DOUBT THAT THE CHIEF AND THE MAN WITH HIM NOW RAN BACK AT ONCE TO TELL ALL THE REST WHAT THEY HAD SEEN AND WHEN THEY HEARD THE NEWS
ANSWERED MY COMPANION AND THEN TURNING TO ME HE GAVE VENT TO THE TENOR OF HIS OWN REFLECTIONS I RESPECT THE SCOTCH SIR I LOVE AND HONOUR THE NATION FOR THEIR SENSE OF MORALITY MEN TALK OF THEIR FILTH AND THEIR POVERTY
AND COMING UP TO ME AS THE COMPANY WERE DISPERSING OBSERVED YOUR FRIEND SIR IS TOO COMMUNICATIVE CONSIDERING THE NATURE OF HIS TRUST THAT GENTLEMAN I REPLIED LOOKING TOWARDS THE TRAVELLER IS NO FRIEND OF MINE
AND FROM HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE MOST DISTINGUISHED WHIGS THEN IN POWER HAD INFLUENCE ENOUGH TO OBTAIN A HEARING FOR MY CAUSE SO UPON THE WHOLE I JUDGED IT MOST SAFE TO STATE MY WHOLE STORY IN THE SHAPE OF A NARRATIVE
I HIGHLY APPROVED OF ANDREW'S AMENDMENT ON MY ORIGINAL PROPOSAL AND WE AGREED TO MEET AT THE PLACE APPOINTED AT THREE IN THE MORNING AT ONCE HOWEVER A REFLECTION CAME ACROSS THE MIND OF MY INTENDED TRAVELLING COMPANION
AND WITH HER HEAD IN HER HAND COMMENCED TO READ TERESA WAS NOT VERY WELL EDUCATED
NOT I SAID PAULA WITH A HEIGHTENED COLOR LOUIS WAS FURIOUS NO YOU SAY OH HE LAUGHED THE WALL'S TOO HIGH PAULA LOOKED AT THE WALL IT WAS CERTAINLY HIGH
YOU HARDLY HAVE ANY SIMILIARITY IN YOUR FACE BUT YOUR VOICE IS LIKE HERS NOW LET ME HUG YOU ONCE MORE MY TREASURE AND TERESA PRESSED TO HER HEART THE MOTHERLESS CHILD IN MY COUNTRY THEY SAY I AM LIKE PAPA
WE DID NOT KNOW AT WHAT HOUR MY FATHER WOULD COME FROM PARIS WITH PAULA AND SO EVERY MOMENT I SAID TO MYSELF PERHAPS THEY HAVE ARRIVED RESULT
JUST AT THIS MOMENT WE HEARD A VOICE CALLING
THEY ARE THE PRIESTS OF PINES AND SEEM EVER TO BE ADDRESSING THE SURROUNDING FOREST THE YELLOW PINE IS FOUND GROWING WITH THEM ON WARM HILLSIDES AND THE SILVER FIR ON COOL NORTHERN SLOPES BUT
COMPELLING HUGE SLEEPING BOULDERS TO WAKE UP AND JOIN IN THEIR DANCE AND SONG TO SWELL THEIR EXULTING CHORUS IN EARLY SUMMER AFTER THE FLOOD SEASON THE YOSEMITE STREAMS ARE IN THEIR PRIME
AND AS THE WHOLE MASS BENEATH AND ABOUT ME JOINED IN THE FLIGHT THERE WAS NO FRICTION THOUGH I WAS TOSSED HERE AND THERE AND LURCHED FROM SIDE TO SIDE WHEN THE AVALANCHE SWEDGED AND CAME TO REST
WHICH BROAD DEEP AND FAR REACHING EXERTED VAST INFLUENCE ON THE SCENERY OF THIS PORTION OF THE SIERRA BUT THERE ARE FINE CAMPING GROUNDS
WITHOUT ANY FORCE OF YOURS WORTHY OF THE NAME ADVANCING TO MEET HIM BUT THIS WAS A DISTANT ENEMY WELL ATHENS AT ALL EVENTS IS A NEAR NEIGHBOUR AND YET ATHENS YOU UTTERLY DISREGARD
INVOKE THY FAVOUR ON EACH MANLY GAME AND DANCE AND SING IN HONOUR OF THY NAME THAT THERE WAS ALSO A POETICAL CONTEST IN WHICH THE IONIANS WENT TO CONTEND AGAIN IS SHOWN BY THE FOLLOWING TAKEN FROM THE SAME HYMN
ON OTHER BUSINESS ON HEARING THE SPEECHES THEY THOUGHT THEMSELVES CALLED UPON TO COME BEFORE THE LACEDAEMONIANS
NIGHT CAME ON WHILE THESE HORRORS WERE ENACTING AND MOST OF IT HAD PASSED BEFORE THEY WERE CONCLUDED
PISISTRATUS WAS REALLY SUPREME
AND IN HIS RAGE HE THRUST HIS KNIFE INTO HER BREAST SO THAT SHE FELL DEAD ON THE GROUND THEN HE TOOK SIMON'S PIPE AND BLEW INTO IT WITH ALL HIS MIGHT IN THE HOPES OF CALLING HIS WIFE BACK TO LIFE BUT HE BLEW IN VAIN FOR THE POOR SOUL WAS AS DEAD AS A DOOR NAIL
BECAUSE SHE HAD A LITTLE PINK ROSE PRINTED UPON HER WHITE THROAT FROM HER EARLIEST INFANCY SHE HAD SHOWN THE MOST ASTONISHING INTELLIGENCE AND THE COURTIERS KNEW HER SMART SAYINGS BY HEART AND REPEATED THEM ON ALL OCCASIONS
BUT SHE WAS NOT ANY MORE SUCCESSFUL LOOK ROUND AS SHE MIGHT THE GOLDEN APPLES BENT THEMSELVES BACK AT LAST THE MOTHER GOT IMPATIENT AND CLIMBED UP HERSELF
THERE HE STOOD THINKING AND WONDERING WHAT HE COULD DO WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE SAW THREE FISHES SWIMMING ALONG AND RECOGNISED THEM AS THE VERY SAME WHOSE LIVES HE HAD SAVED
THE CAPTAIN REPEATEDLY CALLED FOR MORE STEAM WHICH THE ENGINEER REFUSED TO FURNISH CAUTIOUSLY KEEPING THE PRESSURE LOW BECAUSE THE SALT WATER FOAMED IN THE BOILERS AND SOME OF IT PASSED OVER INTO THE CYLINDERS CAUSING
A GRAND OUTBURST IS SOMETIMES MADE WHICH DRAINING THE LARGE LAKE PRODUCES A FLOOD OF AMAZING POWER SWEEPING DOWN IMMENSE QUANTITIES OF MORAINE MATERIAL AND RAISING THE RIVER ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ITS MOUTH
IN THIS PARTICULAR WE FAILED HOWEVER
AND SNOW IN EVERY FORM ABOVE THEM AND THE GREAT DOWN PLUNGING GRANITE BUTTRESSES AND HEADLANDS OF THE WALLS MARVELOUS IN BOLD MASSIVE SCULPTURE FORESTS IN SIDE CANYONS TO WITHIN FIFTY FEET OF THE GLACIER AVALANCHE PATHWAYS OVERGROWN WITH ALDER AND WILLOW
HE WAS ESPECIALLY TIMID AND LIVED IN A PERPETUAL FEAR LEST THE NEWSPAPERS SHOULD SAY SOMETHING HARD OF HIM
MIGHT HAVE OFFERED TO HER AND HAVE HAD HER IF HE WOULD MY DEAR COUSIN AS I WOULD RATHER THAT YOU SHOULD HEAR MY NEWS FROM MYSELF THAN FROM ANY ONE ELSE I WRITE TO TELL YOU THAT
AT SOME CORNER OF THE CASTLE WHICH SEEMED A LONG WAY FROM THE GREAT DOOR IT WAS A CHEERFUL LITTLE ROOM WITH CHINTZ CURTAINS
AS SHE COULD NOT RUSH INTO HIS ARMS
I THINK YOU OWE IT TO HER WELL DUKE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF PLANTAGENET'S PENNY NOW WILL IT EVER BE WORTH TWO HALFPENCE THIS QUESTION WAS ASKED OF THE DUKE OF SAINT BUNGAY
WAS HE INTOXICATED DID YOU THINK SO
I GUESS YOU WON'T GET MARIA AWAY FROM HER VERY EASY SAID MISTER SAVOR LAUGHING HIS WIFE STOOD WITH THE CHILD'S CHEEK PRESSED TIGHT AGAINST HERS OH I'LL MANAGE THAT SAID MISSUS MUNGER I'M COUNTING ON MISSUS SAVOR SHE ADDED IN A HURRIED UNDERTONE TO ANNIE
THE TIRELESS MACHINES MARCHED BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE MEN WHO WATCHED THEM WITH SUICIDAL INTENSITY RAN AFTER THEM BAREFOOTED WHEN THEY MADE OFF WITH A BROKEN THREAD SPLICED IT AND THEN ESCAPED FROM THEM TO THEIR STATIONS AGAIN
THE STATUTE PROVISIONS AND RULES OF THE SOCIETY WA'N'T ORDERED BY PROVIDENCE
IT TOOK ME A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I WAS AND WHY I WAS THERE A SOUND OF SCUFFLING AND TUMBLING ON THE GROUND AT SOME DISTANCE ASSISTED MY WANDERING WITS AND I RUSHED OUT OF THE BARN AND RAN TOWARD THE FIELD
YOU MAY LAY TO IT THAT I FLEW DOWN THOSE CABIN STAIRS FOR IF THERE WAS ANYTHING IN THE WORLD I LONGED FOR IT WAS TO GET A CHANCE TO SEE A SPERM WHALE KILLED AS CAPTAIN COFFIN STEPPED TO THE BOW OF THE BOAT HE ORDERED THE BLACK STEWARD TO HIS PLACE AT THE STEERING OAR
AND WHEN SHE WAS GOING INTO HER CHRYSALIS GRAVE SHE SAID I SHALL BE A BUTTERFLY SOME DAY BUT HER RELATIONS THOUGHT HER HEAD WAS WANDERING AND THEY SAID POOR THING
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DARED BUILD A FIRE IN THE BARN EVEN IF WE HAD HAD MATCHES WILLIS GROPED ABOUT IN THE OLD HAY BAY AND GATHERED A FEW HANDFULS OF MUSTY HAY
ORDERED THE BOATS LOWERED AS THE MEN TUMBLED OVER ONE ANOTHER TO BE FIRST TO REACH THE MONSTERS MY YOUNG HEART DANCED WITHIN ME AND OUR OLD BLACK STEWARD HAD TO HOLD ME BACK I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO GO THERE WAS A GENTLE WIND BLOWING
AND WILL NOT INCOMMODE MY DEAR LUCY BY COMING TO LICHFIELD WHILE HER PRESENT LODGING IS OF ANY USE TO HER I HOPE IN A FEW DAYS TO BE AT LEISURE AND TO MAKE VISITS WHITHER I SHALL FLY IS MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE
YOU MUST THEREFORE BE ENABLED TO DISCHARGE PETTY DEBTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE LEISURE WITH SECURITY TO STRUGGLE WITH THE REST NEITHER THE GREAT NOR LITTLE DEBTS DISGRACE YOU
VIRGIL HORACE PHAEDRUS THE GREATEST AND MOST NECESSARY TASK STILL REMAINS TO ATTAIN A HABIT OF EXPRESSION WITHOUT WHICH KNOWLEDGE IS OF LITTLE USE
BUT BEING ORIGINALLY POOR HE HAS GOT A LOVE OF MEAN COMPANY AND LOW JOCULARITY A VERY BAD THING SIR TO LAUGH IS GOOD AS TO TALK IS GOOD
WITH SWELLED CHEEKS OF A FLORID RED PRODUCED BY THICK PAINTING AND INCREASED BY THE LIBERAL USE OF CORDIALS FLARING AND FANTASTICK IN HER DRESS AND AFFECTED BOTH IN HER SPEECH
WHEN THE DAYS ARE SHORT
AND AWAY WENT THE DEVIL AS FAST AS HE COULD LAY LEGS TO THE GROUND
CAN I GET LEAVE TO HAVE A BED AND SHELTER HERE TO NIGHT ASKED THE YOUTH YOU'LL GET NO GOOD BY SLEEPING HERE SAID THE OLD DAME
SO HE SOLD THE COCK FOR A SHILLING AND BOUGHT FOOD WITH THE MONEY FOR THOUGHT GUDBRAND ON THE HILL SIDE TIS ALWAYS BETTER TO SAVE ONE'S LIFE THAN TO HAVE A COCK AFTER THAT HE WENT ON HOME TILL HE REACHED HIS NEAREST NEIGHBOUR'S HOUSE WHERE HE TURNED IN
HE TOOK WITH HIM A ROPE AND HUNG HIMSELF UP UNDER THE ARM PITS TO A TREE RIGHT IN THE MAN'S WAY SO THE MAN CAME ALONG WITH HIS OX AND WHEN HE SAW SUCH A SIGHT HANGING THERE HE BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE QUEER WELL SAID HE
KATY RUSHED OFF TO WEEP A LITTLE WEEP ALL BY HERSELF PAPA SAID HE WISHED WE WERE ALL LIKE COUSIN HELEN SHE THOUGHT AS SHE WIPED HER EYES AND I MEAN TO TRY
WHILE JOHN AND DORRY EXECUTED A SORT OF WAR DANCE ROUND THE SOFA PHIL'S VOICE SEEMED TO BREAK THE SPELL OF SILENCE AND A PERFECT HUBBUB OF QUESTIONS AND EXCLAMATIONS BEGAN IT APPEARED THAT THIS HAPPY THOUGHT OF GETTING COUSIN HELEN TO THE CELEBRATION WAS CLOVER'S
YOU WERE REAL GOOD TO DO IT RESPONDED CLOVER BUT IF IT HAD BEEN MINE I DON'T THINK I COULD JUST THEN THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND JOHNNIE RUSHED IN
QUESTIONED CECY I DON'T BELIEVE COUSIN HELEN COULD DO ANYTHING WICKED SAID KATY I TOLD MA THAT SHE HAD ON BRACELETS AND MA SAID SHE FEARED YOUR COUSIN WAS A WORLDLY PERSON RETORTED CECY PRIMMING UP HER LIPS

AND WASH IT MUCH AND WITH WARM WATER TO PLEASE IT NOT WITH COLD WATER TO GIVE IT PAIN BOSWELL BUT SIR DOES NOT HEAT RELAX JOHNSON SIR YOU ARE NOT TO IMAGINE THE WATER IS TO BE VERY HOT I WOULD NOT CODDLE THE CHILD
NOW TENANTS WILL NOT GIVE MORE FOR LAND THAN LAND IS WORTH IF THEY CAN MAKE MORE OF THEIR MONEY BY KEEPING A SHOP OR ANY OTHER WAY THEY'LL DO IT
WHICH PROVED IN MANY INSTANCES A MOST RIGOROUS PUNISHMENT
OR CONTINUE TO INHABIT THE PLACE IN WHICH THEY WERE BRED THOSE WHO ARE DISPERSED CANNOT BE FOUND THOSE WHO REMAIN ARE THE SONS OF HIS PERSECUTORS AND ARE NOT LIKELY TO SUPPORT A MAN TO WHOM THEIR FATHERS ARE ENEMIES
SUGGESTED A MOTIVE THE YOUNG LAWYER DROPPED INTO A CHAIR AND SAT FOR SOME MINUTES SILENTLY PORING OVER THE CLERK'S LETTER HE DID NOT LIKE HENRY DUNBAR HIS GENEROUS YOUNG HEART
YOU WANT TO SEE MISTER DUNBAR HE SAID
MARGARET WILMOT WATCHED HIM WITH EAGER SCRUTINIZING EYES SHE SAW DOUBT PERPLEXITY HORROR INDECISION ALL STRUGGLING IN HIS HANDSOME FACE BUT THE LAWYER FELT THAT IT WAS HIS DUTY TO ACT
AND DON'T YOU FRET YOUR PRECIOUS HEART MY BLESSED MISS LAURA IF THE RAIN IS CONTRAIRY
ROLAND LOUNGED IN NOT MORE PRESENTABLE THAN THE REST WHY HAD LADY AUGUSTA NOT BROUGHT THEM UP TO BETTER HABITS WHY SHOULD THEY COME DOWN ON A SUNDAY MORNING MORE UNTIDY THAN ON OTHER MORNINGS
I WONDER WHAT HE'LL PRETEND HE HAS NEXT FROM YOU A NOTE OF INVITATION INDEED MY DEAR SAID JENKINS REVOLVING THE NEWS AND SPEAKING AS WELL AS HIS CHEST WOULD ALLOW HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN A TRICK PLAYED HIM BY THE YOUNG COLLEGE GENTLEMEN WE SHOULD NOT BE TOO HARD UPON THE POOR OLD MAN
IF I DO GO I KNEW HOW LONG IT WOULD LAST LADY AUGUSTA'S INSTRUCTING THEM HERSELF RESUMED MISTER YORKE IT IS NOT A MONTH SINCE THE GOVERNESS LEFT
LADY AUGUSTA CAME IN AND PROFFERED THE INVITATION TO CONSTANCE TO ACCOMPANY THEM CONSTANCE THEN SPOKE OF GIVING THE CHILDREN THE EXTRA TWO HOURS FROM SEVEN TO NINE IT WAS REALLY NECESSARY SHE SAID IF SHE WAS TO DO HER DUTY BY THEM
HE IS FULL OF THE FAVOURS OF THE LADIES OF HIS FAMILY TO ME TO WHOM NEVERTHELESS I AM PERSONALLY A STRANGER EXCEPT THAT I ONCE SAW MISS PATTY MONTAGUE AT MISSUS KNOLLY'S
SUCH STROKES OF GAYETY FANCY AND HUMOUR AS WILL ENTERTAIN AND DIVERT AND AT THE SAME TIME BOTH WARN AND INSTRUCT ALL THE LETTERS ARE WRITTEN WHILE THE HEARTS OF THE WRITERS MUST BE SUPPOSED TO BE WHOLLY ENGAGED IN THEIR SUBJECTS
I BEG YOUR PARDON MY DEAREST FRIEND FOR HAVING GIVEN YOU OCCASION TO REMIND ME OF THE DATE OF MY LAST I WAS WILLING TO HAVE BEFORE ME AS MUCH OF THE WORKINGS OF YOUR WISE RELATIONS AS POSSIBLE
AND TAKE IT AMISS AS THEY HAVE REASON TO BE INCLUDED BY OURS IN THE CONTEMPT THROWN UPON THEIR KINSMAN CURIOSITY AT PRESENT IS ALL MY MOTIVE
THAT ALL HIS RELATIONS ARE AFRAID OF HIM
WHEN I HAD MADE A HOLE LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD ME I GOT IN BUT KEPT DRAWING OUT THE STRAW BEHIND ME AND FILLING THE HOLE IN FRONT THIS I CONTINUED UNTIL I HAD NOT ONLY STOPPED UP THE ENTRANCE BUT PLACED A GOOD THICKNESS OF STRAW BETWEEN ME AND THE OUTSIDE
OF COURSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND A BETTER SERMON THAN ANY OTHER CLERGYMAN WHATEVER COULD HAVE PREACHED BUT WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT WAS OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ME I MAY AS WELL CONFESS AT ONCE THAT I NEVER HAD THE LEAST DOUBT THAT MY FATHER WAS THE BEST MAN IN THE WORLD
AND DOWN THEIR EYELIDS WINKED AND WINKED AND THEIR CHEEKS PUCKERED AND RELAXED INCESSANTLY THERE WAS AN ABSOLUTE STORM OF EXPRESSION UPON THEIR FACES THEIR VERY NOSES TWISTED AND CURLED
AND COLOURED A LITTLE WITH THE MOON'S YELLOWNESS IF I WERE WRITING FOR GROWN PEOPLE I SHOULD TELL THEM THAT THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND THINGS BECAUSE THEY THINK ABOUT THEM AND ASK GOD TO TEACH THEM WALK IN THE SUNLIGHT
SO IT APPEARED THAT THIS AGENT OF THE PACK HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED TO PUT THE LONE WOLF TO SLEEP FOR AN HOUR OR TWO OR MORE PERHAPS NOT PERMANENTLY THAT HE MIGHT BE OUT OF THE WAY LONG ENOUGH FOR THEIR OCCULT PURPOSES
THEY SAY HE'S ON THE PROWL ONCE MORE THE AMERICAN LAUGHED A TRACE CONTEMPTUOUSLY LANYARD'S FINGERS TIGHTENED ON HIS KNIFE AND FORK OTHERWISE HE MADE NO SIGN A SIDELONG GLANCE INTO A MIRROR AT HIS ELBOW SHOWED RODDY STILL ABSORBED IN THE DAILY MAIL
IN CO OPERATION WITH RODDY'S MURDERER
HE OPENED IT AND HESITATED A MOMENT LOOKING OUT AS THOUGH QUESTIONING THE WEATHER SIMULTANEOUSLY HIS DEFT FINGERS WEDGED THE LATCH BACK WITH A THIN SLIP OF STEEL NO RAIN IN FACT HAD FALLEN WITHIN THE HOUR
I READ IT OUT AND PASSED IT TO REGGIE HIS FACE FELL
HIS FATHER IS AN EARL ANYWAY HIS UNCLE'S ONE REGGIE PUT IN GLOOMILY JERKING HIS HEAD TOWARD ME OLD WALMSLEY'S ALL RIGHT EVE PATTED HIS HAND GOOD BOY SHE SAID YOU KNOW I NEVER ENCOURAGED YOU
AND CONTINUED ON MY MENDACIOUS CAREER I HAVE BEEN CLOSETED WITH THE MANAGER I EXPLAINED IT WAS ONE OF THE UNDERWAITERS THE LITTLE DARK ONE WHO BROUGHT IN THE COFFEE
EVEN EVE GAVE A LITTLE SHRIEK UPON THE THRESHOLD STOOD MISTER CULLEN AND BY HIS SIDE A LADY WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ANYWHERE BETWEEN FIFTY AND SIXTY YEARS OLD
THEY ARE STEALING MURDERING AND DESERTION
WHEN THE PALE CHEEK AND QUIVERING LIP OF ISABELLA REMOVED HER RESENTMENT IN A MOMENT IT IS TRUE MY CONJECTURE IS TRUE SPEAK TO ME MISS WHARTON I CONJURE YOU IN MERCY TO MY FEELINGS TO TELL ME DO YOU LOVE DUNWOODIE
WHY RETURNED THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATING A LITTLE I THOUGHT WE WERE AS GOOD AS SO I WONDER IF I HAVE NO CLAIM ON THE HOUSE AND GARDEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOW IT IS HARVEY'S IT WILL SURELY BE CONFISCATED TURNING TO LAWTON WHO HAD BEEN SITTING IN ONE POSTURE WITH HIS
I'M SURE HARVEY HAS SUFFERED ENOUGH ALREADY FROM HAVING SO MUCH CONCERNS WITH THE RIG'LARS REPLIED THE HOUSEKEEPER HE HAS LOST HIS ALL AND MADE HIMSELF A VAGABOND THROUGH THE LAND AND I HAVE REASON TO RUE THE DAY I EVER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
NEVERTHELESS OUR PREPARATIONS PROGRESSED RAPIDLY AND I BECAME IMPATIENT TO GET AWAY AT THE SAME TIME I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I COULD HARDLY REST
WHILE NOT BELIEVING IN HIM MYSELF I RECOILED KNOWING THAT SHE BELIEVED IN HIM IT WAS NOT VAIN TERROR THAT ARRESTED MY HAND WHO SAW ME I WAS ALONE AND IT WAS NIGHT WAS IT PREJUDICE WHAT PREVENTED ME FROM HURLING OUT OF MY SIGHT THAT LITTLE PIECE OF BLACK WOOD
AND COVERED WITH A LINEN CLOTH SATISFIED WITH HIS WORK
I STOPPED BEFORE THE SLEEPER WHAT SLEEP I SAID SURELY THIS MAN DOES NOT DREAM HIS CLOTHES ARE IN TATTERS HIS CHEEKS ARE WRINKLED HIS HANDS HARDENED WITH TOIL
AND WALKING STRAIGHT UP TO MISTER DINSMORE SHE PUT HER ARM THROUGH HIS SAYING WITH A LITTLE LAUGH AND WHAT WAS MEANT FOR A VERY ARCH EXPRESSION YOU SEE I DON'T STAND UPON CEREMONY WITH OLD FRIENDS MISTER DINSMORE IT ISN'T MY WAY
WHICH WAS IN THE SECOND STORY AND OPENED UPON A VERANDA SHADED BY TALL TREES AND OVERLOOKING A LARGE GRASSY YARD AT THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING BEYOND WERE GREEN FIELDS WOODS AND HILLS
SAID ROSE SMILING YOU DON'T WISH ANY SUCH THING ON THE CONTRARY YOU WOULD BE THE VERY FIRST TO FLY TO THE RESCUE IF YOU SAW HER IN DANGER OF DROWNING BUT BEFORE THERE WAS TIME FOR ANYTHING MORE TO BE SAID MISS STEVENS HAD RETURNED
SHE WAS ABSENT BUT A FEW MOMENTS FROM THE PARLOR WHERE SHE HAD LEFT HER FATHER BUT WHEN SHE RETURNED TO IT HE WAS NOT THERE MISS ROSE TOO WAS GONE SHE FOUND UPON FURTHER SEARCH
AND READ TO US NOW AND THEN A SNATCH OF POETRY I FORGET WHAT MY BOOK EXCEPT WHEN I WAS THINKING OF THE TARN AND THAT OLD MAN I SO HATED WAS MISS BRANDON'S EXQUISITE AND MYSTERIOUS FACE THAT YOUNG LADY WAS LEANING BACK IN HER GREAT OAK CHAIR
AND LAKE PULLED ON HIS WHITE GLOVE GLANCING DOWN THE FILE OF SILENT WAITERS SOME LOOKING FRIGHTENED AND SOME RESERVED IN WHITE TIES AND WAISTCOATS AND HE GLIDED OUT OF THE ROOM HIS MIND SOMEWHERE ELSE
AND DREW IT UNCOMMON MILD AND HE HAS BEEN USEFUL TO ME AND I THINK MATTERS ARE PRETTY WELL ARRANGED TO DISAPPOINT THE KIND INTENTION OF GOOD UNCLE WYLDER THE BRUTE HE HATED MY FATHER BUT THAT WAS NO REASON TO PERSECUTE ME AND I BUT AN INFANT ALMOST WHEN HE DIED
AT DISADVANTAGE AND REMARKED THAT SOME OF MISTER LARKIN'S CLIENTS LOOKED ALWAYS UNHAPPY THOUGH THEY HAD SO GODLY AN ATTORNEY TO DEAL WITH WHEN LAKE WITH A LITTLE SHUDDER FOR IT WAS GROWING CHILL
HE SMOKES OBSERVED THE MAJOR SIGNIFICANTLY BAH A PIPE SAID PATSY AND BULL DURHAM IS ONLY FIVE CENTS A BAG AND A BAG OUGHT TO LAST A WEEK AND EVERY SATURDAY NIGHT SIR
SAID THE OLD WOMAN WITH A SIGH OF INTENSE RELIEF I CAN DIE IN PEACE
AND WAS SO GENTLE AND UNOBSTRUSIVE THAT AUNT JANE LOOKED AT HIM WITH SURPRISE
BUT MAY I ENQUIRE WHERE ON EARTH YOU EXPECT TO STOW ME IN THIS RATHER LIMITED ESTABLISHMENT WHERE HAVE YOU NO EYES THEN SHE ASKED IN ASTONISHMENT IT'S THE FINEST SOFA IN THE WORLD UNCLE JOHN AND YOU'LL SLEEP THERE LIKE A TOP
AND THE SUBSEQUENT FINDING OF THE WILL
AND EITHER A WOODEN HORSE OR SADDLE TREES FOR THE SADDLES AND PADS ALL THESE PARTS SHOULD BE DRY CLEAN AND SHINING THIS IS ONLY TO BE DONE BY CAREFUL CLEANING AND POLISHING
WITH REASONABLE EXERCISE WILL NOT BE THROWN AWAY AFTER THIS OPERATION ON REACHING HOME VERY HOT THE GROOM SHOULD WALK HIM ABOUT FOR A FEW MINUTES THIS DONE HE SHOULD TAKE OFF THE MOISTURE WITH THE SCRAPER
FOUR EGGS SUGAR TO TASTE ONE QUARTER POUNDS OF CURRANTS FLAVOURING OF VANILLA GRATED LEMON PEEL OR NUTMEG MODE CUT NINE SLICES OF BREAD AND BUTTER NOT VERY THICK AND PUT THEM INTO A PIE DISH
UNCLEANLINESS HOWEVER LIBERAL THE BILL OF FARE WILL BE TAKEN AS AN INVITATION BY THE LITTLE BITING PESTS AND HEARTILY RESPONDED TO MIX HALF A TEASPOONFUL OF HYDRO OXALIC ACID WITH TWELVE TEASPOONFULS OF WATER
BUT THE FOLLOWING FACTS CONNECTED WITH COFFEE
DROVE EVERY THOUGHT OF FUTURE DANGER OUT OF HIS MIND HE HAD AT LEAST THE PRESENT HE ANSWERED WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE
THE TOUCH OF HER FINGERS WAS WONDERFUL COOL AND SOFT AND SOMEHOW REASSURING HE FELT A SENSE OF RELAXATION FELT THE STRAIN OF LIVING SUDDENLY GROW LESS YOU KNOW SHE SAID
YOU CAN CALL UPON HIM AT HIS HOTEL IF YOU LIKE THE WALDORF HE IS GOING TO I BELIEVE AND I AM SURE HE WILL TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT'S ALL RIGHT MISS DALSTAN THE YOUNG MAN DECLARED SOOTHINGLY
I HAVE LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THE LAST FEW DAYS BUT THEN WE KNEW ALL THE TIME DIDN'T WE THAT IT WAS JUST AN INTERLUDE THE THINGS WHICH LIE BEFORE US ARE SO FULL OF INTEREST IT IS THE NEXT FEW HOURS WHICH I FEAR HE MUTTERED GLOOMILY SHE LAUGHED AT HIM FOOLISH
HE GROANED AS HE SANK INTO HIS CHAIR AND THE HAND WITH WHICH HE POURED OUT A GLASS OF SPIRITS SHOOK THE GLASS RATTLED AGAINST HIS TEETH WHEN HE RAISED IT TO HIS LIPS
HE ASKED CAUSE IF THERE IS I AIN'T A GOING TO SAY A WORD NO NOT FOR NO THOUSAND POUNDS ME NEVER HAVING BEEN IN NO TROUBLE OF ANY SORT GUV'NOR
THERE'S NO REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T TELL THE TRUTH THE FACT IS I'VE NOTHING TO FEAR YOU CAN'T GIVE ME IN CHARGE FOR IT SO HAPPENS THAT I'VE GOT A POWER OF ATTORNEY
ANSWERED MYERST WHEN I DID KNOW THEN I BEGAN TO PUT THINGS TOGETHER AND TO PURSUE MY OWN LINE INDEPENDENT OF EVERYBODY I TELL YOU I HAD ALL MAITLAND'S PAPERS AND POSSESSIONS

PROVOKED IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BY INJUSTICE AND EXAGGERATED BY RAGE AND PANIC
IS THE ARRANGEMENT IF THAT IS BAD THE WHOLE THREAD ON WHICH THE IDEAS STRING THEMSELVES BECOMES TWISTED THOUGHTS PLACED IN A WRONG CONNECTION ARE NOT EXPOUNDED IN A MANNER THAT SUITS THE RIGHT
INSTEAD OF DEPENDING AS IN SO GREAT A DEGREE IT NOW DOES ON THE ACCIDENT OF BIRTH WILL BE MADE BY CONCERT ON AN ACKNOWLEDGED PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE
AND LOOKED FOR LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT FROM IT SAVE THAT OF KEEPING THE TRADITION UNBROKEN OF WHAT I THOUGHT A BETTER PHILOSOPHY WHAT HOPES I HAD OF EXCITING ANY IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

WHICH WE SEE IS THE SENSE OF MANKIND IN THE SOLEMNEST DECLARATION OF THEIR OPINIONS HUMAN LAWS NOT PUNISHING THE MAD MAN FOR THE SOBER MAN'S ACTIONS NOR THE SOBER MAN FOR WHAT THE MAD MAN DID THEREBY MAKING THEM TWO PERSONS
NOTHING BUT POWERS IN IT TO PRODUCE THOSE IDEAS IN US
