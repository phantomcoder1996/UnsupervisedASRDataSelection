WITH SUCH PRECAUTIONS THE COURTIERS MIGHT BID DEFIANCE TO CONTAGION THE EXTERNAL WORLD COULD TAKE CARE OF ITSELF IN THE MEANTIME IT WAS FOLLY TO GRIEVE OR TO THINK THE PRINCE HAD PROVIDED ALL THE APPLIANCES OF PLEASURE
THAT IT FORMS IDEAS OF THEM IN ISOLATION FROM THEIR CONNECTIONS WITH WHAT GOES BEFORE AND COMES AFTER THEN JUDGMENT OR THOUGHT IS CALLED UPON TO COMBINE THE SEPARATED ITEMS OF KNOWLEDGE
AS ONLY WESTERN HORSES WILL STAND IT DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG TO HAVE THOSE BRIDLES BACK IN PLACE AND AS I TOSSED EACH OVER THE PEAK OF THE MEXICAN SADDLE
MISTER CAMPERDOWN THOUGHT THAT THE PROPERTY SHOULD BE GIVEN UP OH YES THAT'S THE MAN'S NAME A HORRID MAN I AM TOLD THAT HE WAS REALLY MOST CRUEL TO HER

JUDGE MULLOWNY ADDRESSED THE PRISONERS WITH MANY HIGH SOUNDING WORDS ABOUT THE SERIOUSNESS OF OBSTRUCTING THE TRAFFIC IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND INADVERTENTLY SLIPPED INTO A DISCOURSE ON RUSSIA AND THE DANGERS OF REVOLUTION

AND YET EXCEPTING ONCE THAT HE WAS BEGUILED INTO IT BY MISSUS WADMAN HE HAD NEVER LOOKED STEDFASTLY INTO ONE AND WOULD OFTEN TELL MY FATHER IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS HEART

THE STRONG MEN AT THE HEAD OF FAMILY PARTIES THE LEAN OLD MEN PRESSING FORWARD WITHOUT HOPE OF RETURN YOUNG BOYS WITH FEARLESS EYES GLANCING CURIOUSLY SHY LITTLE GIRLS WITH TUMBLED LONG HAIR
SOMETHING SHE HAD BEEN WANTING TO DO FOR A LONG TIME I HAD TO HE SAID TRYING TO IGNORE THE LIGHT TOUCH OF HER FINGERS BECAUSE I THOUGHT SO MUCH OF YOU I COULDN'T HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO INSULT YOU

INJURY HAD PERHAPS ALREADY BEEN DONE IT MAY BE THAT SOME SLIGHTEST SOIL HAD ALREADY MARRED THE PURE WHITE OF THE GIRL'S NATURAL CHARACTER BUT IF SO THE STAIN WAS AS YET TOO IMPALPABLE TO BE VISIBLE TO ORDINARY EYES
I KNOW I TOOK TO YOU AT FIRST SIGHT I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU WHEN I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY A LONELY LITTLE FOREIGNER AND YOU A GREAT BEAUTIFUL LADY FOR SUCH YOU SEEMED TO ME THOUGH YOU HAVE TOLD ME SINCE YOU WERE ONLY A GREAT GAWKY GIRL
