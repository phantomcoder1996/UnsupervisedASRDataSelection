BUT THE HARD VENGEFUL HEART OF HER BAFFLED ENEMY
THE YOUNG MAN'S FACE HAD BECOME ALMOST TRANSFIGURED HIS EYES SHONE WITH ENTHUSIASM HERO WORSHIP LOVE ADMIRATION FOR HIS LEADER SEEMED LITERALLY TO GLOW UPON HIS FACE
THEY SAY IN PARIS THAT EVERY TIME A ROYALIST ESCAPES TO ENGLAND THAT DEVIL
HE WILL FIND A FAITHFUL ALLY IN LADY BLAKENEY BLESS THE WOMAN EJACULATED LADY PORTARLES DID EVER ANYONE SEE SUCH PERVERSITY
WHY WHEN WE WERE IN THE DEAR OLD CONVENT TOGETHER WE WERE ALWAYS HAPPY WHEN WE WERE ALLOWED TO BE ALONE TOGETHER AND TO TALK SECRETS THE TWO YOUNG GIRLS HAD LINKED THEIR ARMS IN ONE ANOTHER'S AND BEGAN WANDERING ROUND THE GARDEN
MARGUERITE'S ACHING HEART STOOD STILL SHE FELT MORE THAN SHE HEARD THE MEN ON THE WATCH PREPARING FOR THE FIGHT HER SENSES TOLD HER THAT EACH WITH SWORD IN HAND WAS CROUCHING READY FOR THE SPRING
NOT TO KNOW THAT IF HE FAILED IN GAINING HIS OWN ENDS HE WOULD BE PITILESS SHE FELT COLD
I COULD NOT DEMEAN MYSELF BY TRYING TO EXPLAIN AND AND NOW I HAVE THE SATISFACTION ARMAND OF KNOWING THAT THE BIGGEST FOOL IN ENGLAND HAS THE MOST COMPLETE CONTEMPT FOR HIS WIFE
IN THE SMART ORCHESTRA BOXES MANY WELL KNOWN FACES WERE TO BE SEEN MISTER PITT OVERWEIGHTED WITH CARES OF STATE WAS FINDING BRIEF RELAXATION IN TO NIGHT'S MUSICAL TREAT THE PRINCE OF WALES
IN THE TEETH OF THE SPIRITED BIDDING OF THREE MEAT EXTRACT FIRMS FROM THAT MOMENT HIS SUCCESS WAS CONTINUOUS AND ASSURED AND THE ROYAL ACADEMY WAS THANKFUL TWO YEARS LATER TO GIVE A CONSPICUOUS POSITION ON ITS WALLS TO HIS LARGE CANVAS
AND ALL THE BUSY PLACES OF THE FARM SEEMED TO LEAD BY EASY ACCESS INTO ITS WIDE FLAGGED HAVEN WHERE THERE WAS ROOM FOR EVERYTHING AND WHERE MUDDY BOOTS LEFT TRACES THAT WERE EASILY SWEPT AWAY
LATIMER SPRINGFIELD WAS A RATHER CHEERLESS OLDISH YOUNG MAN WHO WENT INTO POLITICS SOMEWHAT IN THE SPIRIT IN WHICH OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT GO INTO HALF MOURNING
BUT HE FOUND HIMSELF MORE OFTEN WONDERING HOW MANY BOY SCOUTS WERE SHARING HIS MELTON OVERCOAT
HIS REMARKABLE PICTURE OX IN A MORNING ROOM LATE AUTUMN WAS ONE OF THE SENSATIONS AND SUCCESSES OF THE NEXT PARIS SALON AND WHEN IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXHIBITED AT MUNICH IT WAS BOUGHT BY THE BAVARIAN GOVERNMENT
A LIGHT DRIZZLING RAIN WAS FALLING BUT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF ANY INUNDATION SOME HALF HOUR LATER HE MET VERA ON THE WAY TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM
THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS OF COURSE SAID EGBERT PEOPLE WHO REALLY TRY TO INFUSE A BREATH OF REALITY INTO THEIR LETTERS OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT AUNT SUSAN FOR INSTANCE WHO WRITES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE HAM
THE FEATHERED COMBATANT HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING ABLE WHEN HARD PRESSED TO TAKE REFUGE ON THE BED AND FREELY AVAILED HIMSELF OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THE PIGLING NEVER QUITE SUCCEEDED IN HURLING HIMSELF ON TO THE SAME EMINENCE BUT IT WAS NOT FROM WANT OF TRYING
FOR CAVIL AT THE GENUINENESS OF ITS PILGRIMAGE AND IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT THE ARRANGEMENTS MADE FOR TRANSMITTING COPY AND CARRYING ON THE USUAL FEATURES OF THE PAPER DURING THE LONG OUTWARD JOURNEY WORKED SMOOTHLY AND WELL
FINALLY THE RATTLING BANG OF FOLDING SEATS INSIDE ANNOUNCED THAT THE USHERS WERE AT WORK NEW YORK SEEMED NOT SO MUCH AWAKENING AS TURNING OVER IN ITS BED PALLID MEN RUSHED BY PINCHING TOGETHER THEIR COAT COLLARS
GRAY CONVENT WALL ON A GRAY DAY AND A GIRL WITH HER CLOAK BLOWN BY THE WIND SITTING ATOP OF IT AND THINKING ABOUT THE MANY COLORED WORLD AS A RULE SUCH SENTIMENT BORED HIM
SOME OF THEM HAD BEEN FRESHMEN AND WILD FRESHMEN WITH AMORY SOME WERE IN THE CLASS BELOW
DANCING IN MOCKING GLEE BESIDE HIM CLARA'S WAS THE ONLY ADVICE HE EVER ASKED WITHOUT DICTATING THE ANSWER HIMSELF EXCEPT PERHAPS IN HIS TALKS WITH MONSIGNOR DARCY
I'D HAVE COME IN WELL BURNE SAID SUDDENLY AFTER A FEW MOMENTS SILENCE WE'RE HALF WAY THROUGH LET'S TURN BACK ON THE RETURN HE LAUNCHED INTO A DISCUSSION OF WILL IT'S THE WHOLE THING HE ASSERTED
WILD OF COURSE EVERY ONE'S BEEN SITTING AND ARGUING AND SWEARING AND GETTING MAD AND GETTING SENTIMENTAL AND GETTING BRUTAL IT'S THE SAME AT ALL THE CLUBS I'VE BEEN THE ROUNDS THEY GET ONE OF THE RADICALS IN THE CORNER AND FIRE QUESTIONS AT HIM
THIS DIALOGUE MERGED GROTESQUELY INTO HIS MIND'S MOST FAMILIAR STATE A GROTESQUE BLENDING OF DESIRES WORRIES EXTERIOR IMPRESSIONS AND PHYSICAL REACTIONS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVENTH STREET OR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVENTH STREET
THEN I KNEW I WAS THROUGH BEING AFRAID OF THE DARK LORDY AMORY BREATHED
QUAINT AND MEDITATIVE CHARM METAMORPHOSED THE STRAY TELEGRAPH BOY INTO A PUCK LIKE CREATURE OF DELIGHTFUL ORIGINALITY AT FIRST THIS QUALITY OF HERS SOMEHOW IRRITATED AMORY HE CONSIDERED HIS OWN UNIQUENESS SUFFICIENT AND IT
YOU'RE REALLY HUMBLE AT HEART YOU SINK TO THE THIRD HELL OF DEPRESSION WHEN YOU THINK YOU'VE BEEN SLIGHTED IN FACT YOU HAVEN'T MUCH SELF RESPECT CENTRE OF TARGET TWICE CLARA HOW DO YOU DO IT
HE OPENED THE CASE AND OFFERED THEM TO THE QUEEN WITH DEEP AND SILENT ANGUISH THE QUEEN STRETCHED OUT HER HAND SEIZED THE RING PRESSED IT CONVULSIVELY TO HER LIPS AND WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO BREATHE A SIGH TO GIVE VENT TO A SOB
PENETRATED INTO THE ROOM THROUGH THE WINDOW THE CURTAINS OF WHICH RAOUL HAD NEGLECTED TO CLOSE ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING HE WAS STILL SLEEPING HIS HEAD GRACEFULLY REPOSING ON HIS ARM
AND WE RETURNED TO ASK YOUR ADVICE MY ADVICE IS THIS SAID MONSIEUR D'ARMINGES AND IF NEEDS BE MY WILL THAT WE BEAT A RETREAT
THE WALKER WHO DURING THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE TWO FRIENDS HAD PASSED AND REPASSED BEHIND THEM SEVERAL TIMES STOPPED AT THE NAME OF DE WINTER BUT AS HIS FACE BETRAYED NO EMOTION AT MENTION OF THIS NAME IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BY CHANCE HE STOOD SO STILL
THE INVITATIONS ARE GIVEN FOR THIS EVENING SAID THE COADJUTOR BUT THE VIOLINS WILL NOT BEGIN TO PLAY UNTIL TO MORROW MORNING
THEN MOUNTING A STAIRCASE HAD OPENED A DOOR
I THINK I SHALL SEND HIM TO PARIS SO THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THE MOMENT FOR ATTACK HAD ARRIVED SUPPOSE HE SAID WE ROUGHLY CHALK OUT A CAREER FOR THIS YOUNG MAN I WISH TO CONSULT YOU ABOUT SOME THING
MADE HIS HORSE REAR AS THE SHOT WAS FIRED HIS HORSE BOUNDED TO ONE SIDE LOSING ITS FOOTING AND FELL ENTANGLING RAOUL'S LEG UNDER ITS BODY THE SPANIARD SPRANG FORWARD AND SEIZED THE GUN BY ITS MUZZLE
THE PROOF OF WHICH IS THAT HERE WE ARE
BUT THAT ACT OF SELF CONTROL EFFECTIVE AS IT WAS DID NOT ESCAPE THE EYES OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS SHE STOPPED ON THE THRESHOLD BREATHED A SIGH AND ADDRESSING THE QUEEN WHY THEN DO YOU ALWAYS WEEP MOTHER WHEN I AM AWAY FROM YOU SHE SAID
WENT ON MISTER JENKS WILL YOU GO WITH ME ON THIS QUEST GO IN YOUR AIRSHIP TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF THE DIAMOND MAKERS IF YOU WILL I WILL SHARE WITH YOU WHATEVER DIAMONDS WE CAN DISCOVER OR MAKE BESIDES PAYING ALL EXPENSES
HE WAS GLIDING SWIFTLY TOWARD THE EARTH AND WITH THE PLAN IN HIS MIND OF ADMINISTERING SOME SORT OF PUNISHMENT TO THE BULLY HE AIMED THE MACHINE DIRECTLY AT HIM NEARER AND NEARER SHOT THE MONOPLANE AS QUIETLY AS A SHEET OF PAPER MIGHT FALL
MUST HAVE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BEEN OVERTAKEN BY SOME SUPERNATURAL VISITOR ANDY GAVE A YELL LIKE AN INDIAN ABOUT TO DO A STAGE SCALPING ACT AND FAIRLY DIVED OVER THE HANDLEBARS OF HIS BICYCLE SPRAWLING IN A HEAP ON THE DUSTY ROAD
WAS THE REPLY OR RATHER WE DIDN'T IT WAS THE NERVOUS REACTION CAUSED BY YOUR FRIGHT AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAD DONE WRONG THAT MADE YOU JUMP OVER THE HANDLEBARS THAT'S THE SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION YOU YOU DID IT
I HOPE LIGHTNING DOESN'T STRIKE AROUND HERE THE STORM CAME ON RAPIDLY BUT THERE WAS A CURIOUS QUIETNESS IN THE AIR THAT WAS MORE ALARMING THAN IF A WIND HAD BLOWN THE CAMPFIRE BURNED STEADILY
I WAS TAKEN INTO A SMALL CHAMBER OF THE CAVE AND THERE SAW QUITE A COMPLICATED APPARATUS PART OF IT WAS A GREAT STEEL BOX WITH A LEVER ON IT WE WILL LET YOU MAKE SOME DIAMONDS FOR YOURSELF FOLWELL SAID TO ME
THEN I'LL HELP YOU GET IT OUT BLESS MY FRYING PAN BUT I AM VERY FOND OF LOBSTER EXCLAIMED MISTER DAMON IN AS NATURAL TONES AS WAS POSSIBLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
THE OTHER IN A ROUGH STATE DO YOU CARE TO STATE WHERE THESE DIAMONDS CAME FROM ASKED MISTER ROBERTS LOOKING CRITICALLY AT TOM I HAD RATHER NOT ANSWERED THE LAD IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE DIAMONDS
MEANING THE BRILLIANT AND NOBLE MAID IN SPITE OF THE WICKED UNCLE GUNDEBALD WERE MARRIED AT SOISSONS
RATHER THAN THE FOE OF THE EMPEROR ASK HIM WHETHER IT WOULD NOT BE IN KEEPING WITH HIS VALOR AND HIS MIGHT
SAID THE PREFECT ANTHEMIUS WHEN THE GLITTERING REAR GUARD HAD PASSED FROM THE HIPPODROME AND THE PRINCESS PULCHERIA ADDED AND THESE O MEN FROM THE NORTH ARE TO HELP AND SUCCOR THE FRIENDS OF THE GREAT EMPEROR
IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT USURP THE THRONE AND HOW SHE THE PRINCESS WOO HAD BEEN FLUNG INTO THE SWIFT HWANG HO FROM THE TURBID WATERS OF WHICH SHE HAD BEEN RESCUED BY THE BANNERMAN OF THE DRAGON GATE
WHEN THREATENED BY FOREIGN FOES OR BY THE DESTROYING OCEAN FLOODS JACQUELINE'S EYE CAUGHT THE FLUTTER OF THE BROAD BANNER OF THE HOUSE OF ARKELL THAT WAVED OVER THE REBEL CAMP AGAIN SHE SAW THE BRAVE LAD WHO ALONE OF ALL HER FATHER'S COURT SAVE SHE
FROM HER STATION IN THE CITADEL SHE LOOKED OVER THE SCENE BEFORE HER HERE ALONG THE LOW BANK OF THE RIVER MAAS STRETCHED THE CAMP OF HER OWN FOLLOWERS AND THE LITTLE GAYLY COLORED BOATS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER ARMY UP THE RIVER FROM THE RED ROOFS OF ROTTERDAM
NEXT TO HER OWN FEARLESS FATHER NOT THE DAUPHIN JOHN OF FRANCE BUT THIS BRAVE YOUNG REBEL LAD OTTO THE LORD OF ARKELL
WAS GREAT AND POWERFUL THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF CHUNG KWOH THE MIDDLE KINGDOM AS THE CHINESE FOR NEARLY THIRTY CENTURIES HAVE CALLED THEIR VAST COUNTRY
AND THE VENGEANCE OF THE COUNTESS WAS SHARP AND MERCILESS BUT IN THE FLUSH OF VICTORY WRATH GAVE WAY TO PITY AGAIN AND THE YOUNG CONQUEROR IS REPORTED TO HAVE SAID SADLY AND IN TEARS AH I HAVE WON AND YET HOW HAVE I LOST
THAT THE PEOPLE HAD RESERVED THEM FOR SACRIFICES BUT THAT AS TO THE NATION OF THE AMALEKITES IT WAS ENTIRELY DESTROYED AS HE HAD RECEIVED IT IN COMMAND TO SEE DONE AND THAT NO ONE MAN WAS LEFT BUT THAT HE HAD SAVED ALIVE THE KING ALONE
AND HE AND HIS SON STOOD ON THE OTHER SIDE AND HE SOUGHT TO DISCOVER THE OFFENDER BY LOT NOW THE LOT APPEARED TO FALL UPON JONATHAN HIMSELF SO WHEN HE WAS ASKED BY HIS FATHER WHAT SIN HE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF
HE MET THE ARMY BEFORE THE CITY WALLS AND WITH A LOUD VOICE TOLD THEM THAT THEY HAD GOTTEN THE VICTORY NOT BY THEIR OWN STRENGTH BUT BY REASON OF THE ANGER GOD HAD AGAINST KING AHAZ
BUT ONLY IN ORDER TO MAKE THEM MORE USEFUL IN THEIR SERVICE THAT AS FOR HIMSELF HE SHALL NOT BE SO MUCH CONCERNED FOR HIS OWN PRESERVATION FOR IF HE DIE UNJUSTLY HE SHALL NOT RECKON IT ANY AFFLICTION BUT THAT HE IS CONCERNED FOR THEM LEST BY CASTING STONES AT HIM
BUT DEDICATED HIS SWORD TO GOD AT THE TABERNACLE CHAPTER TEN SAUL ENVIES DAVID FOR HIS GLORIOUS SUCCESS AND TAKES AN OCCASION OF ENTRAPPING HIM FROM THE PROMISE HE MADE HIM
TO BE HURRIED AWAY BY DEATH BUT I AM BOUND TO ACCEPT OF WHAT PROVIDENCE ALLOTS AS IT PLEASES GOD FOR WE HAVE BY NO MEANS LIVED ILL BUT IN A SPLENDID AND HAPPY MANNER
WHICH IS THE OCCASION OF HIS SILENCE NOW I SWEAR BY HIM HIMSELF THAT THOUGH HE THAT HATH COMMITTED THIS SIN SHOULD PROVE TO BE MY OWN SON JONATHAN I WILL SLAY HIM AND BY THAT MEANS WILL APPEASE THE ANGER OF GOD AGAINST US
AND LET THERE BE ONE COMMANDER OVER EACH NUMBER TO BE DENOMINATED FROM THE NUMBER OF THOSE OVER WHOM THEY ARE RULERS BUT SUCH AS THE WHOLE MULTITUDE HAVE TRIED AND DO APPROVE OF
AND FROM SUCH ORNAMENTS OF SPEECH ALSO AS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PLEASURE OF OUR READERS THAT THEY MAY ENTERTAIN THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT WE WRITE WITH SOME AGREEABLE SATISFACTION AND PLEASURE
THERE ARE THE MAKINGS OF A VERY FINE PRIG IN YOU DICK SAID THE NILGHAI I'VE LIBERATED MY MIND ESTIMABLE BINKIE WITH THE FEATHERS IN HIS MOUTH DICK PICKED UP THE STILL INDIGNANT ONE AND SHOOK HIM TENDERLY
WHAT'S THE ONE THING IN THE NILGHAI SAGA THAT I'VE NEVER DRAWN IN THE NUNGAPUNGA BOOK DICK CONTINUED TO TORPENHOW WHO WAS A LITTLE ASTONISHED AT THE OUTBURST
IT'S A CLUMSY ENDING AND VILE JOURNALESE BUT IT'S QUITE TRUE AND YET HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND SNATCHED AT THE MANUSCRIPT
AN AFFABLE ACTRESS A DEVASTATING CYCLONE OR MINE OWN SWEET SELF AND YOU PRESUME TO LECTURE ME ABOUT MY WORK NILGHAI IF IT WERE WORTH WHILE I'D CARICATURE YOU IN FOUR PAPERS
THAT THIS WAS NO PLACE FOR TAIL WAGGING AND SETTLED HIMSELF ON DICK'S LAP TILL IT WAS BEDTIME THEN HE WENT TO BED WITH DICK
AS IF THEIR SOULS MATTERED I'VE HEARD MORE ABOUT ART AND SEEN LESS OF HER IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS THAN IN THE WHOLE OF MY LIFE DO YOU REMEMBER CASSAVETTI WHO WORKED FOR SOME CONTINENTAL SYNDICATE OUT WITH THE DESERT COLUMN
GO HOME NILGHAI SAID DICK GO HOME TO YOUR LONELY LITTLE BED AND LEAVE ME IN PEACE
FRONTAL BONE OPTIC NERVE EXTREME CAUTION AND THE AVOIDANCE OF MENTAL ANXIETY VERDICT HE SAID FAINTLY MY BUSINESS IS PAINTING AND I DAREN'T WASTE TIME WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT
THAT IF HIS FATE WERE BLINDNESS ALL THE TORPENHOWS IN THE WORLD COULD NOT SAVE HIM I CAN'T CALL HIM OFF HIS TRIP TO SIT DOWN AND SYMPATHISE WITH ME I MUST PULL THROUGH THIS BUSINESS ALONE HE SAID HE WAS LYING ON THE SOFA
NOW THIS WAS THE WOMAN WHO HAD GIVEN TWO SCONES AS AN ALMS TO THE ASKER AND WHOSE HANDS HAD BEEN CUT OFF THEREFOR AND WHEN THE KING MARRIED HER HER FELLOW WIVES ENVIED HER AND WROTE TO THE COMMON HUSBAND THAT SHE WAS AN UNCHASTE
FOR IF I DENIED IT HE WOULD PUT ME ON MY OATH AND I SHOULD BE DISGRACED IN THE WORLD TO COME WHILST IF I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD SPENT THE MONEY HE WOULD MAKE AN OUTCRY AND DISHONOUR ME BEFORE MEN
IT WAS A GIFT OF ALMIGHTY ALLAH TO US AND THE OTHER SAID IT IS WORTH A THOUSAND DIRHAMS AND I WILL GIVE THEE THAT BUT TAKE IT TO SUCH AN ONE FOR HE HATH MORE MONEY AND SKILL THAN I SO THE JEW TOOK IT TO THE JEWELLER WHO SAID
WHO SAID OPEN THE DOOR TO THEM
AND HE BECAME AS ONE DRUNKEN WITH SLUMBER AND WHILE HE WAS ON THIS WISE
THEN SAID SHE KEEP AWAY FROM ME THOU FOR THOU ART STRICKEN WITH LEPROSY
SO THE CALIPH'S SISTER LEFT HER THAT DAY AND RETURNED TO HER ON THE MORROW WITH CLOTHES AND NECKLACES OF JEWELS AND DRESSED HER AFTER WHICH THE CALIPH CAME IN TO HER AND SAT DOWN BY HER SIDE AND HIS SISTER SAID TO HIM
NOW WHEN THE DAUGHTER OF HIS UNCLE WHO WAS HIS WIFE SAW THE SLAVE SHE SAID TO HER HUSBAND O MY COUSIN WHAT IS THIS DAMSEL HE REPLIED OF A TRUTH I BOUGHT HER FOR THE SAKE OF THE LITTLE ONE ON HER ARM
HE WHOSE WATER THIS IS IS SUFFERING FROM SUCH AND SUCH A DISEASE AND THE PATIENT WOULD DECLARE VERILY THIS PHYSICIAN SAYETH SOOTH SO HE CONTINUED TO DO THE OCCASIONS OF THE FOLK
DID I NOT FORBID THEE MANY A TIME WHEN THE OATH OF DIVORCE WAS ALWAYS IN THY MOUTH AS IT WERE HOLY WRIT THEN HE TURNED TO HIS RIGHT AND
FOR FEMININE SHOPPING MANY A YOUNG LADY OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE TURNED TO LOOK AFTER HIM AND THOUGHT IT STRANGE TO SEE HIM OCCUPIED
HE HAD RESUMED HIS PIPE AND PUT HIS WELL IN THE FORM OF AN INTERROGATION WHY SHE WENT ON WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THE FARMERS HE PUFFED AWAY I RECKON THEY'D HAVE EITHER TO GIVE UP THEIR FARMS OR TO GIVE FAIR RATE OF WAGE
HE WAS WITH MAMMA WHEN SHE DIED SAID MARGARET SOFTLY TO BE SURE TO BE SURE WHY SOME ONE ASKED ME IF HE HAD NOT BEEN OVER THEN
AS IF I WERE ALWAYS THINKING THAT HE CARED FOR ME WHEN I KNOW HE DOES NOT HE CANNOT HIS MOTHER WILL HAVE SAID ALL THOSE CRUEL THINGS ABOUT ME TO HIM BUT I WON'T CARE FOR HIM
AND OF THINKING HER OWN THOUGHTS WHILE SHE RESTED INSTEAD OF ANXIOUSLY WATCHING ANOTHER PERSON TO LEARN WHETHER TO BE GRAVE OR GAY AFTER TEA SHE RESOLVED TO EXAMINE A LARGE PACKET OF LETTERS AND PICK OUT THOSE THAT WERE TO BE DESTROYED
WHILE HERE NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES FOR US ENOUGH TO NOTICE WHAT WE DO
CARESSING IT AND KISSING IT AS IF TO COMFORT MISSUS HALE CRIED WITHOUT RESTRAINT AT LAST SHE SAT STRAIGHT STIFF UP ON THE SOFA
I'LL WRITE AND TELL HER SHE MUST THE GIRL MUST HAVE SOME WOMAN FRIEND ABOUT HER IF ONLY TO TALK HER INTO A GOOD FIT OF CRYING DIXON WAS CRYING ENOUGH FOR TWO
THERE WERE THE THREE HARD FACTS HARDLY SPOKEN WHAT MAKES YOU SAY SO
WHEN EAMES WENT INTO THE SITTING ROOM THE COLONEL WAS THERE ALONE AND HAD TO TAKE UPON HIMSELF THE TROUBLE OF INTRODUCING HIMSELF HE DID NOT GET UP FROM HIS ARM CHAIR
YOU'LL BEWARE OF MARRYING TOO SOON IN LIFE I THINK A MAN SHOULD MARRY EARLY IF HE MARRIES WELL SAID EAMES DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME CONTINUED LUPEX IT ISN'T ABOUT MISSUS L I'M SPEAKING I'VE ALWAYS REGARDED MY WIFE AS A VERY FASCINATING WOMAN
THE SQUIRE'S COMING I SUPPOSE ISN'T HE SAID MISSUS HEARN AS SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE SOFA CLOSE TO MISSUS DALE YES HE'LL BE HERE BY AND BY UNLESS HE CHANGES HIS MIND YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T STAND ON CEREMONY WITH ME
HERE'S MISTER CRADELL DOES SAY SUCH QUEER THINGS QUEER THINGS SAID CRADELL NOW MISS SPRUCE I APPEAL TO YOU HAVE I SAID ANY QUEER THINGS IF YOU DID SIR I DIDN'T NOTICE THEM SAID MISS SPRUCE
I WILL GO IN HE SAID BUT DON'T COME WITH ME HE WAS EVER SO SERIOUS AND I'M SURE HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF IT ALL THE WAY ALONG AND WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE SERIOUS OH NO OF COURSE HE OUGHT TO BE SERIOUS BUT ARE YOU NOT GLAD MAMMA
PAWKINS'S PORT WINE MAY PERHAPS HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE RESOLUTION BUT I'D GO THROUGH FIRE AND WATER FOR HER MY LORD I KNEW HER YEARS BEFORE HE HAD EVER SEEN HER AND HAVE LOVED HER A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN HE WILL EVER LOVE ANY ONE
HOW DIFFERENT HAD IT BEEN WHEN CROSBIE HAD MADE HIS OFFER LILY FOR THE TIME HAD BEEN RAISED TO A PINNACLE A PINNACLE WHICH MIGHT BE DANGEROUS BUT WHICH WAS AT ANY RATE LOFTY WITH WHAT A PRETTY SPEECH HAD CROSBIE BEEN GREETED
AND AFTER DINNER MISSUS DALE WENT THROUGH THE GARDENS UP TO THE OTHER HOUSE WITH A WRITTEN NOTE IN HER HAND IN THAT NOTE SHE HAD TOLD LADY JULIA WITH MANY PROTESTATIONS OF GRATITUDE
I THINK SHE'D PITCH INTO HIM AS YOU CALL IT HERSELF IF SHE KNEW HOW YOU COME DOWN TO GUESTWICK FOR THE CHRISTMAS AND THEN GO OVER TO ALLINGTON AND TELL THEM ALL PLAINLY WHAT YOU MEAN I COULDN'T SAY A WORD TO HER NOW SAY IT TO THE SQUIRE THEN
THE DINGLE BELL I NOW MUST TELL I VE NAMED FOR BROTHER HOBART AND WHEN THE FLOWERS HAVE LIVED THEIR LIVES IN SUNSHINE AND IN RAIN AND THEN DO FADE WHY PAPA SAID
SO FOR SEVERAL DAYS I WATCHED HIM MAKING ALL KINDS OF TOYS AND I WONDERED TO SEE HOW QUICKLY HE MADE THEM AND HOW MANY NEW THINGS HE INVENTED I ALMOST WISH I WAS A CHILD I SAID TO HIM ONE DAY FOR THEN I TOO COULD HAVE PLAYTHINGS
AFTER THIS SAID SANTA CLAUS I CAN MAKE RABBITS WITHOUT HAVING YOU FOR A PATTERN BUT IF YOU LIKE YOU MAY STAY A FEW DAYS LONGER IN MY CASTLE AND AMUSE YOURSELF I THANKED HIM AND DECIDED TO STAY
I LL TELL YOU WHAT WE CAN DO REMARKED THE ASTRONOMER
YOU RE IN NORWICH THAT IS TRUE ANSWERED THE MAN WHO WAS QUITE BEWILDERED BY THIS IDEA AND OF COURSE YOU MUST BE CALLED SOMETHING CONTINUED THE MAGISTRATE WELL THEN SAID THE PRISONER
BUT WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THE WINTER IN WINTER WE RABBITS SAID BUNNY SO SHY KEEP WATCH TO SEE SANTA GO GALLOPING BY AND DO YOU EVER SEE HIM ASKED THE GIRL EAGERLY OH YES EVERY WINTER
THE MAN IN THE MOON CALLED TO HIM AND SAID HOW IS EVERYTHING DOWN ON THE EARTH EVERYTHING IS LOVELY REPLIED THE ALDERMAN AND I WOULD N'T LEAVE IT IF I WAS NOT OBLIGED TO
AND THEN SHE ROMPED AWAY TO THE FIELDS TO AMUSE HERSELF IN HER OWN WAY SHE CAME TO KNOW EVERY FLOWER THAT GREW AND TO CALL THEM BY NAME AND SHE ALWAYS STEPPED VERY CAREFULLY TO AVOID TREADING ON THEM FOR DOROTHY WAS A KIND HEARTED CHILD
DIRECTION IT WAS HER DUTY TO UNDO IT IF POSSIBLE AT ANY COST OF RIDICULE TO HERSELF OH FELICITY SHE SAID HER VOICE EXPRESSING A VERY ANGUISH OF HUMILIATION I
I HAVE AN IDEA THAT A RASPBERRY PIE FOR TO MORROW NIGHT WHEN THE FOLKS COME HOME WOULD HIT THE RIGHT SPOT ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA WE ALL SET OFF ARMED WITH JUGS AND CUPS FELICITY THOUGHTFUL CREATURE ALSO TOOK A SMALL BASKETFUL OF JELLY COOKIES ALONG WITH HER
DO YOU THINK HE'LL EVER TELL YOU WHO ALICE IS I ASKED I HAVE A NOTION WHO ALICE IS ALREADY SAID THE MYSTERIOUS CREATURE BUT SHE WOULD TELL US NOTHING MORE WHEN THE JELLY COOKIES WERE ALL EATEN IT WAS HIGH TIME TO BE MOVING HOMEWARD
THE POOR MAN MEANT IT AS A COMPLIMENT BUT FELICITY WHO KNEW UNCLE BLAIR WAS AN ARTIST AND HAD A POOR OPINION OF SUCH FRY LOOKED INDIGNANT AND RETORTED INDEED SHE WASN'T
I'LL TELL YOU SAID PETER I'LL PICK UP A LOT OF THOSE LITTLE ROUND PEBBLES ON MISTER KING'S FRONT WALK
CECILY GAVE A SHRIEK AND RAN OUT OF THE WOOD WE THOUGHT SHE HAD FLED BECAUSE SHE COULD NOT ENDURE THE SIGHT OF BLOOD AND WE WERE NOT SORRY FOR HER MANIFEST DISAPPROVAL AND ANXIETY WERE DAMPING THE EXCITEMENT OF THE OCCASION
PLEADED CECILY TURNING TO THE STORY GIRL WHO WAS SITTING ON A BIN SWINGING HER SHAPELY BARE FEET TO AND FRO IT DOESN'T DO TO MEDDLE IN AN AFFAIR OF THIS KIND BETWEEN BOYS SAID THE STORY GIRL SAGELY
GAMBLING WHAT WOULD AUNT JANE SAY IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO FIGHT CECILY DEMANDED OF PETER DON'T YOU DRAG MY AUNT JANE INTO THIS AFFAIR SAID PETER DARKLY YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE A PRESBYTERIAN
THEN WE FOREGATHERED AROUND A TINY WOOD SPRING COLD AND PELLUCID UNDER ITS YOUNG MAPLES AND ATE THE JELLY COOKIES AND THE STORY GIRL TOLD US A TALE OF A HAUNTED SPRING IN A MOUNTAIN GLEN WHERE A FAIR WHITE LADY DWELT
IS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND FEET WHILE THE DISTANCE IS ONLY ABOUT TEN MILES AN AVERAGE FALL OF SIX HUNDRED FEET PER MILE THE LAST MILE OF ITS COURSE
BESIDES THESE COMMON AFTER STORM AVALANCHES THAT ARE TO BE FOUND NOT ONLY IN THE YOSEMITE BUT IN ALL THE DEEP SHEER WALLED CANYON OF THE RANGE THERE ARE TWO OTHER IMPORTANT KINDS
ITS MOST CONSTANT COMPANION IS THE YELLOW PINE
A DULL RUSHING RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD WHICH RAPIDLY INCREASES AND SEEMS TO DRAW NEARER WITH APPALLING INTENSITY OF TONE PRESENTLY THE WHITE FLOOD COMES BOUNDING INTO SIGHT OVER BOSSES AND SHEER PLACES
TEN MILES IN DIAMETER FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AND FOURTEEN FROM WEST TO EAST LYING BARE IN THE TREELESS DESERT LIKE A DISK OF BURNISHED METAL THOUGH AT TIMES IT IS SWEPT BY MOUNTAIN STORM WINDS AND STREAKED WITH FOAM
TO THE EASTWARD YOU GAZE FAR OUT OVER THE DESERT PLAINS AND MOUNTAINS OF THE GREAT BASIN RANGE BEYOND RANGE EXTENDING WITH SOFT OUTLINES BLUE AND PURPLE IN THE DISTANCE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND FEET BELOW YOU LIES LAKE MONO
AND ITS DEEPLY SCULPTURED FOUNTAIN PEAKS CALLED
VARYING GREATLY IN FORM SIZE BEHAVIOR AND IN THE SONGS THEY SING SOME ON THE SMOOTH SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS ARE SHORT AND BROAD OTHERS LONG AND RIVER LIKE IN THE SIDE CANYONS OF YOSEMITES
LINGER HERE IF NIGHT IS STILL DISTANT FOR VIEWS OF THIS FAVORITE FALL AND THE STUPENDOUS ROCK SCENERY ABOUT IT THEN DESCEND A STAIRWAY BY ITS SIDE FOLLOW A DIM TRAIL THROUGH ITS SPRAY
AT LEAST TAKING ANOTHER LOOK AT THE SHIPS WHICH HAD NOW CROSSED OUR WAKE HE ADDED BLAST THOSE NANTUCKETERS THEY CAN SMELL A SPERM WHALE FIVE MILES TO THEIR LEEWARD ANY TIME HE HAD COME DOWN FROM THE RIGGING AND ORDERED THE HEAD SAILS THROWN BACK
I SOON HAD ONE OF THE CANDLES LIGHTED I SAT DOWN ON THE AFTER THWART AND HELD THE LIGHT ALOFT TILL MY ARM ACHED EVERYTHING ABOUT ME WAS MADE MORE WEIRD BY THE GLEAM OF THE LANTERN
AS I RAN TWO OR THREE DULL WHACKS CAME TO MY EAR GOT HIM TOM I SHOUTED RUSHING UP TOM WAS HOLDING AND SQUEEZING ONE OF HIS HANDS WITH THE OTHER AND SHAKING IT VIOLENTLY
WE SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO HAVE KEPT THE OLD ONE BUT SHE MIGHT HAVE SPARED HERSELF THE REMARK FOR IN THE SAME MOMENT THE PRINCESSES GAVE EACH OTHER SUCH A STAB WITH THEIR STINGS THAT THEY BOTH FELL DEAD AS A DOOR NAIL
THIS IS A WEATHER BREEDER GRANDMOTHER REMARKED AT BREAKFAST
POSSIBLY HOWEVER RATHER MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THE AVERAGE CANINE PET THE FOURTH OF JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO WAS A GALA DAY AT ROANOKE ISLAND
THE BEES HAD THEM READY IN NO TIME AND THEN THE QUEEN LAID TEN PRETTY EGGS ONE IN EACH OF THE BIG ROOMS AND THE DOORS WERE FIXED AS BEFORE EVERY DAY THE BEES FLEW IN AND OUT GATHERING GREAT HEAPS OF HONEY AND FLOWER DUST BUT IN THE EVENING WHEN THEIR WORK WAS DONE
WITH THE GUILE SO APT TO DEVELOP IN A BOY WHO HAS OLDER BROTHERS WHO TEASE HIM BUT WE DID SAID JOHN IF YOU TELL THEM I'LL LICK YOU EXCLAIMED WILLIS MAKE THEM BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN GUARDING THIS BEAR JOHN AND I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF SO GLARING A DECEPTION
THAT MADE A NOISE WELL NIGH AS LOUD AS A GUN WHEN WE GAVE JUST THE RIGHT SORT OF BLOW THE TROUT BELOW WOULD TURN ON THEIR BACKS AND FLOAT UP TO THE ICE JOHN AND I SOON SECURED TWO GOOD STRINGS OF TROUT AND BY THIS TIME WILLIS
EVER WAS IT FAST DAY AND FLESHLESS DAY WITH HER SO THAT BY ANY MEANS SHE MIGHT LIGHTEN THE BURTHEN THAT HER FRIEND MUST CARRY IN HIS ARMS NOW ON THE APPOINTED DAY THIS YOUNG DANSELLON CAME VERY EARLY TO THE APPOINTED PLACE
THE LAY OF THE DOLOROUS KNIGHT MY HARPER CALLED HIS SONG BUT OF THOSE WHO HEARKENED SOME NAMED IT RATHER THE LAY OF THE FOUR SORROWS IN NANTES OF BRITTANY
CONTEMNERS OF LOVE WHO DELIGHT THEMSELVES IN SADNESS BUT ENDURE IT I MUST FOR ALAS I KNOW NOT HOW TO DIE SO ON THE APPOINTED DAY THE LADY WAS WEDDED TO THE BARON
GIFTS SHE GAVE TO ALL ALIKE TENDER MESSAGES SHE SENT TO EACH EVERY KNIGHT DEEMED HIMSELF ESTEEMED AND FAVOURED ABOVE HIS FELLOWS AND BY SOFT WORDS AND FAIR SERVICE
PROMISING FOR HIS PART THAT WERE SHE GIVEN HIM HE WOULD BEAR HER IN HIS ARMS TO THE SUMMIT OF THE MOUNT THE KING WAS NO WISE WRATH AT HIS PRESUMPTION HE SMILED RATHER AT HIS FOLLY
HE DETERMINED THEREFORE THAT HE WOULD LEAVE HIS COUNTRY AND SEEK ADVENTURE AS A KNIGHT ERRANT BEYOND THE SEA THE VARLET DELAYED NO LONGER THAN THE EVENING ON THE MORROW HE BADE FAREWELL TO HIS AUNT
WOULD NOT BE REFRESHED IN HEART AND BLOOD AND BONES SUCH VIRTUE HAD THIS MEDICINE DIRECTLY IT WERE DRUNKEN THIS SIMPLE SHE POURED WITHIN A LITTLE FLACKET
SO SHALL THE SONG BE KNOWN AS THE LAY OF THE DOLOROUS KNIGHT THUS WAS THE LAY CONCEIVED MADE PERFECT AND BROUGHT TO A FAIR BIRTH FOR THIS REASON IT CAME BY ITS NAME THOUGH TO THIS DAY SOME CALL IT THE LAY OF THE FOUR SORROWS
I DROPPED IN HALLO SAID BLAKE HAVE A DRINK I HAD A LIME JUICE THEN I HAD ANOTHER AND THEN
WHICH SEEMED TO BREAK THE SPELL SOMEHOW
WELL THERE YOU ARE SAID CELIA TRIUMPHANTLY LET'S PLAY PROVERBS I DON'T THINK I KNOW IT SAID HERBERT HE WOULDN'T OH IT'S QUITE EASY FIRST YOU THINK OF A PROVERB LIKE
THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING I COULD THINK OF THE ENGRAVED RING ARRIVED AS WE WERE AT TEA A FEW DAYS LATER AND I HAD A SUDDEN OVERWHELMING FEAR THAT CELIA WOULD NOT BE PLEASED
MISSUS HERBERT REPEATED HER HUSBAND'S TRIUMPH WITH THE AND THEN IT WAS MY TURN AGAIN FOR THESE HORRIBLE CAMELS MY ONLY HOPE WAS THAT OUR HOST WOULD ASK ME IF I HAD BEEN TO THE ZOO LATELY BUT I DIDN'T SEE WHY HE SHOULD
BUT I KEEP ON MAKING IT EIGHT AND TUPPENCE JUST HAVE A SHOT AT IT THERE'S A GOOD FELLOW I PROMISED THE GIRL YOU KNOW I SAT DOWN WORKED IT OUT HASTILY ON THE BACK OF AN ENVELOPE AND MADE IT A YARD AND A HALF
I ARRIVED EXHAUSTED AND WITH ONLY JUST STRENGTH ENOUGH TO KNEEL DOWN AND PRESS MY FOREHEAD AGAINST THE LARGE BLOCK OF ICE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP ROUND WHICH THE LOBSTERS NESTLED HERE YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT SAID THE FISHMONGER WAVING ME AWAY
A WEDDING RING ENGRAVED AND I FELT IN MY POCKETS NOT INITIALS I SAID AND I FELT IN SOME MORE POCKETS BUT BUT I TRIED THE TROUSERS POCKETS AGAIN WELL LOOK HERE I'LL BE QUITE FRANK WITH YOU
I'M EVER SO MUCH OLDER NOW TALKING ABOUT WEDDING RINGS SHE WENT ON AS SHE TWISTED HER OWN ROUND AND ROUND SHE'S GOT ALL SORTS OF THINGS WRITTEN INSIDE HERS THE DATE AND THEIR INITIALS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
ONE DAY SHE HEARD HIM IMPLORING THE LITTLE SLAVEY TO PUT SOME BUTTONS ON HIS SHIRTS THE SLAVEY TOSSED HER HEAD AND SAID SHE'D SEE ABOUT IT WHEN HE'D GONE OUT ANNA CAME DOWNSTAIRS CALMLY DEMANDED HIS SHIRTS AND HAVING THE SLAVEY UNDER HER THUMB GOT THEM
CAN'T YOU AS JIM DON'T WANT TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WESTALL THANK YOU KINDLY ALL THE SAME SHE ADDED BREAKING OFF HER NARRATIVE WITH THE SAME UNCERTAINTY OF MANNER THE SAME TIMID SCRUTINY OF HER VISITOR THAT MARCELLA HAD NOTICED BEFORE
IT IS TO BE FEARED OR ANY WISH TO BE GOOD BUT ONLY AN ACHING INMOST SENSE OF CHILDISH LONELINESS AND HELPLESSNESS
COVETOUS EAGERNESS IT WAS BUT THREE MONTHS OR SO SINCE MARCELLA'S FATHER MISTER RICHARD BOYCE HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE OWNERSHIP OF MELLOR PARK
SAID MISSUS JELLISON SHARPLY TO HER AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN A CHILD OF TEN THAT YOU DON'T SAY GOOD EVENIN TO THE YOUNG LADY MISSUS WESTALL CURTSIED LOW AND HOPED SHE MIGHT BE EXCUSED AS IT HAD GROWN SO DARK
DREAMS MARCELLA HAD NO FAIRY TALES
OH THANK YOU THANK YOU KINDLY MISS SAID MISSUS HURD RAISING HER APRON TO HER EYES TO STAUNCH SOME IRREPRESSIBLE TEARS AS MARCELLA SHOWED HER THE ADVERTISEMENT WHICH IT MIGHT POSSIBLY BE WORTH HURD'S WHILE TO ANSWER
NEVERTHELESS AS SHE SADLY CAME AND WENT PREPARING THE SUPPER SHE SAW THAT HE WAS APPEASED IN A BETTER TEMPER THAN BEFORE WHAT DID YOU TELL ER HE ASKED ABRUPTLY
DOZEN OTHERS IN THE COMFORTLESS LAVATORY SHE HATED THE MEALS IN THE LONG SCHOOLROOM WHERE BECAUSE TWICE MEAT WAS FORBIDDEN AND TWICE PUDDING ALLOWED
THE WHOLE OF HER FIRST YEAR WAS ONE CONTINUAL SERIES OF SULKS QUARRELS AND REVOLTS
AND TOLD HERSELF TO BE CHEERFUL BUT IT WAS HARD SHE WAS FAR BETTER BORN AND BETTER EDUCATED THAN HER HUSBAND HER FATHER HAD BEEN A SMALL MASTER CHAIR MAKER IN WYCOMBE AND HER MOTHER
THE UNMOUNTED PAPER MAPS INSTEAD OF THE LINEN ONES WHEN RANGON HIMSELF FOUND US COMING OUT TO MEET US IN A VERY BADLY TURNED OUT TRAP
WATCHING HIM GULP IT DOWN QUEER LOOKING BACK ACROSS ALL THAT TIME AT EM ISN'T IT HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT IN A MIXED
AND THE WINTRY EASTERN LIGHT BEYOND THE CHIMNEY HOODS SEEMED SUDDENLY ALMOST TO DIE OUT BESSIE
SOMETHING THAT I CLASSED FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON WITH THE DARK AND IGNORANT SORT OF WORDS SUCH AS OBI AND HOODOO
ROMARIN DID NOT RECOGNISE HIM WHEN HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE STREET AND WALKED TOWARDS HIM HE HADN'T MADE UP HIS MIND BEFOREHAND EXACTLY HOW HE HAD EXPECTED MARSDEN TO LOOK
I COULDN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM AS BEING CALLED ANYTHING ELSE THE FIRST IMPRESSION THAT YOU GOT OF HIS HEAD WAS THAT IT WAS A PATCHWORK OF BLACK AND WHITE BLACK BUSHY HAIR AND SHORT WHITE BEARD OR ELSE THE OTHER WAY ABOUT
THE GIPSY SAT SUDDENLY ERECT IT IS NOT SO KEEP STILL IN YOUR CHAIR SHE ORDERED AND I WILL TELL YOU WHEN IT WAS A CURIOUS THING THAT FOLLOWED
ITS NAME WAS BECAUSE I FORGET HOW MANY THOUSANDS WERE KILLED IN A RIVER BED THERE AND THEY STOVE IN THE WATER CASKS SO THAT IF THE MEN WANTED WATER THEY'D HAVE TO GO FORWARD AND FIGHT FOR IT
THE UNBROKEN WHITENESS OF THE UPLANDS TOLD THAT AND EVEN AS THEY SPOKE THERE CAME UP THE HILL THE DARK FIGURES OF THE FARM MEN WITH SHOVELS ON THEIR WAY TO DIG OUT THE SHEEP IN THE SUMMER THE BAILIFF WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CALL THE GIPSIES VAGABONDS AND ROOST ROBBERS
BUT HE ALWAYS SHOOK HIS BLACK AND WHITE PIEBALD HEAD HE'D NEVER BE ABLE TO KEEP THE BARGAIN IF HE WERE TO MAKE IT HE TOLD US QUITE FAIRLY
IF IT HADN'T BEEN PROVENCE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEWHERE ELSE I SUPPOSE NEARLY IF NOT QUITE AS GOOD BUT THIS WAS PROVENCE THAT SMELLS AS YOU MIGHT SAY OF TWENTY FOUR AS IT SMELLS OF ARGELASSE AND WILD LAVENDER AND BROOM
ACCORDINGLY WHENEVER A MONARCHY IS AT ALL REPRESENTATIVE TIME HAS AN IRRESISTIBLE TENDENCY TO INCREASE ITS PRESTIGE THE KING IS FELT TO BE THE GUARDIAN AS WELL AS THE SYMBOL OF ALL PUBLIC GREATNESS MEANTIME A DOUBLE DISLOCATION IS POSSIBLE HERE PATRIOTISM MAY BE WHOLLY IDENTIFIED WITH PERSONAL LOYALTY TO THE SOVEREIGN
DECLENSION FROM PURE VITALITY AND TO DIFFUSE BEING MEANT TO DILUTE IT WITH NOTHINGNESS THIS DECLENSION MIGHT TAKE PLACE IN INFINITE DEGREES EACH RETAINING SOME VESTIGE OF PERFECTION MIXED AS IT WERE
AN INITIAL ADVANTAGE WHICH MAY EASILY ROLL UP AND INCREASE PRODIGIOUSLY BECOMING THE BASIS OF PROLONGED GOOD FORTUNE SOMETIMES THIS INITIAL ADVANTAGE IS A MATTER OF NATURAL STRUCTURE LIKE TALENT STRENGTH OR GOODNESS SOMETIMES AN ACCIDENTAL ACCRETION LIKE BREEDING
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HAS NO PRACTICAL FORCE SAVE THAT WHICH MECHANICAL CAUSES ENDOW IT WITH ITS PRIVILEGES ARE FRUITS OF INEVITABLE ADVANTAGES ITS OPPRESSIONS ARE SIMPLY NEW FORMS AND VEHICLES
SHOULD LEARN THE SECRETS OF AN UNKNOWN LAND ITS ARTS AND RESOURCES HIS FELLOW CITIZENS ON HIS RETURN WOULD NOT HESITATE TO FOLLOW HIS DIRECTION IN RESPECT TO THOSE NOVEL MATTERS IT WOULD BE SENSELESS FOLLY ON THEIR PART TO BEGRUDGE HIM HIS ADVENTITIOUS EMINENCE
OF A NOBLER TYPE BECAUSE WHEN TASTE AND KNOWLEDGE HAVE NOT YET TAKEN SHAPE THE ONLY WAY OFTEN IN WHICH IDEAL INTERESTS CAN HERALD THEMSELVES IS IN THE GUISE OF SOME IMAGINED UNION
BECAUSE JEHOVAH ONCE FOUGHT FOR THE JEWS WE NEED NOT CONTINUE TO SAY THAT THE TRUTH IS SOLICITOUS ABOUT US WHEN IT IS ONLY WE THAT ARE FIGHTING TO ATTAIN IT
IT HAS NO COGENCY FOR THE INATTENTIVE AND NO EXISTENCE FOR THE IGNORANT ALTHOUGH THE UNIVERSE THEN MAY NOT HAVE COME FROM CHAOS HUMAN EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY HAS BEGUN IN A PRIVATE AND DREAMFUL CHAOS OF ITS OWN
INITIAL DIFFERENCES IN TEMPER MUST BE ORGANISED INTO CUSTOM AND BECOME CUMULATIVE BY BEING IMITATED AND ENFORCED THE ONLY ARTISTS WHO CAN SHOW GREAT ORIGINALITY ARE THOSE TRAINED IN DISTINCT AND ESTABLISHED SCHOOLS
WHO HAD DURING THEIR LIVES PRETENDED TO BE UPRIGHT AND HONORABLE IN ORDER TO DECEIVE THE JUST BUT THESE WRETCHES WERE NOT THE ONLY DENIZENS OF BLACK TARTARUS THERE WERE TO BE SEEN GREAT SCOUNDRELS WHO HAD STARTLED THE WORLD WITH THEIR FRIGHTFUL CRIMES
WISER AND MORE FULL OF CLEVER DEVICES FAR AND WIDE HE WAS KNOWN AS ODYSSEUS OF THE MANY COUNSELS
THE KING QUICKLY SUMMONED HARISARMAN ON ACCOUNT OF HIS REPUTATION FOR KNOWLEDGE OF MAGIC AND HE WHEN SUMMONED TRIED TO GAIN TIME AND SAID I WILL TELL YOU TO MORROW
PUTTING OFF HIS ARMOR HE DRESSED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN HIS PILGRIM'S ROBE AND WITH HIS STAFF IN HIS HAND SET OUT AGAIN UPON HIS JOURNEY
AND IT WAS THEIR DUTY IN WHICH THEY WERE HELPED BY A DRAGON TO GUARD THE GOLDEN APPLES HERCULES KILLED THE DRAGON AND CARRIED OFF THE APPLES BUT THEY WERE AFTERWARDS RESTORED TO THEIR PLACE BY MINERVA
AND GOLDEN RIPE PEARS AND ROSY APPLES AT ALL OF THOSE WONDERS ODYSSEUS STOOD AND GAZED BUT IT WAS NOT FOR LONG FOR HE HASTENED THROUGH THE HALLS TO WHERE THE QUEEN SAT IN THE FIRELIGHT SPINNING HER PURPLE YARN
AND IN THE GLOW LOKI SAW A BROAD RED RING WHICH SEEMED TO LIVE AND MOVE AGAIN HE TRIED TO SPOIL THE WORK AS A FLY AND BIT DEEPLY INTO BROK'S NECK BUT BROK WOULD NOT SO MUCH AS RAISE HIS HAND TO RID HIM OF THE PAIN
HE LIKED TEASING FOLK BUT HE DID NOT LIKE HAVING TO ATONE FOR HIS MISCHIEF AFTERWARDS HE TURNED THE MARVELOUS GIFTS OVER SCORNFULLY IN HIS HANDS AND SAID THAT HE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING VERY WONDERFUL IN THEM THEN LOOKING AT SINDRI HE ADDED HOWEVER
THE BALL FLEW INTO THE RIVER AND AS IT WAS SWEPT AWAY TO THE SEA THE PRINCESS AND ALL HER MAIDENS SCREAMED ALOUD THEIR CRIES AWOKE ODYSSEUS AS HE LAY ASLEEP IN HIS BED OF LEAVES I MUST BE NEAR THE HOUSES OF MEN HE SAID
NO DOUBT THE CITY DWELLERS WHO WERE IMPRESSED BY THE PROWESS OF THE HAIRY AND POWERFUL WARRIORS WERE ALSO READY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE GREATNESS OF THEIR WAR GODS AND TO ADMIT THEM INTO THE PANTHEON THE FUSION OF BELIEFS WHICH FOLLOWED MUST HAVE STIMULATED THOUGHT
THE REFERENCE HOWEVER ACCORDING TO JASTROW IS NOT TO THE SALT OCEAN BUT THE SWEET WATERS FLOWING UNDER THE EARTH WHICH FEED THE STREAMS
AND WHEN SHE WAS COME TO THE ENTERING OF THE HORSE GATE BY THE KING'S HOUSE THEY SLEW HER THERE AND JEHOIADA MADE A COVENANT BETWEEN HIM AND BETWEEN ALL THE PEOPLE
HE WAS THE CHIEF FIGURE IN A TRIAD IN WHICH HE FIGURED AS EARTH GOD WITH ANU AS GOD OF THE SKY
ON THIS WATER TO PUT HIS PURE SPELL
THE BESTOWER OF BLESSINGS SKILFUL ENGINEERS HAD SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF WATER DISTRIBUTION BY IRRIGATING SUN PARCHED AREAS AND PREVENTING THE EXCESSIVE FLOODING OF THOSE DISTRICTS WHICH ARE NOW RENDERED IMPASSABLE SWAMPS WHEN THE RIVERS OVERFLOW
IN THE NORTH HE HAD TO DRIVE BACK INVADING BANDS OF THE MUSKI
WERE RIVALS FOR THE THRONE THE FORMER THE RIGHTFUL HEIR APPEALED FOR HELP TO SHALMANESER AND THAT MONARCH AT ONCE HASTENED TO ASSERT HIS AUTHORITY IN THE SOUTHERN KINGDOM
IS A WORD OF UNCERTAIN MEANING
MANY CAPTIVES I BURNED WITH FIRE MANY OF THEIR SOLDIERS I TOOK ALIVE OF SOME I CUT OFF HANDS AND LIMBS OF OTHERS THE NOSES EARS AND ARMS OF MANY SOLDIERS I PUT OUT THE EYES
NOWHERE REMARKS PROFESSOR JASTROW DOES A HIGH FORM OF CULTURE ARISE WITHOUT THE COMMINGLING OF DIVERSE ETHNIC ELEMENTS
THE NEWS CONVEYED BY THE TELEGRAMS WAS AT TANKERVILLE ALMOST AS SOON AS IN THE COURT AT THE OLD BAILEY AND WAS BELIEVED AS READILY THE NAME OF THE LADY WHO HAD TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY TO BOHEMIA ON BEHALF OF THEIR HANDSOME YOUNG MEMBER
AND FILLED THE GALLERY WITH STRANGERS WE MAY SAY PERHAPS THAT THE HIGHEST DUTY IMPOSED UPON US AS A NATION IS THE MANAGEMENT OF INDIA
I NEEDN'T SIT FOR THE BOROUGH UNLESS I PLEASE I SUPPOSE PLEADED PHINEAS WELL NO AT LEAST I DON'T KNOW SAID RUDDLES IT WOULD BE THROWING US OVER A GOOD DEAL AND I'M SURE YOU ARE NOT THE GENTLEMAN TO DO THAT AND THEN MISTER FINN
HE HAD BROUGHT HIS TELEGRAM DIRECT TO THE OLD BAILEY AND THE CHIEF JUSTICE NOW HELD IT IN HIS HAND
HE MUST VANISH OUT OF THE WORLD
ARE NECESSARY TO THE MAINTENANCE OF A GREAT ARISTOCRACY HE HAS HAD THE POWER OF MAKING THE WORLD BELIEVE IN HIM SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN RICH AND A DUKE HIS NEPHEW WHEN HE COMES TO THE TITLE
WAS ON THE TONGUE OF EVERY WOMAN IN TANKERVILLE AND A MOST DELIGHTFUL ROMANCE WAS COMPOSED SOME FEW PROTESTANT SPIRITS REGRETTED THE NOW ASSURED ESCAPE OF THEIR ROMAN CATHOLIC ENEMY AND WOULD NOT EVEN YET ALLOW THEMSELVES TO DOUBT
THE PERSON WHOM HE NOW SAW MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MAN IN THE STREET OR MISTER FINN MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MAN OR ANY OTHER MAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE MAN LORD FAWN WAS VERY DIGNIFIED VERY RESERVED AND VERY UNHAPPY TO HIS THINKING HE WAS THE GREAT MARTYR OF THIS TRIAL
BUT ALSO BY THE PREVIOUS CONDUCT OF THAT GENTLEMAN BUT WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE LATE MEMBER SHOULD BE THOUGHT BY THE ELECTORS OF TANKERVILLE TO BE ESPECIALLY WORTHY OF THEIR CONFIDENCE BECAUSE HE DID NOT MURDER MISTER BONTEEN
THEIR DEMANDS CONTAINED IN NINETEEN PROPOSITIONS AMOUNTED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY THEY REQUIRED THAT NO MAN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE COUNCIL WHO WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO PARLIAMENT
HE EMPLOYED ALL THE ADVANTAGES WHICH REMAINED TO HIM AND ROUSED UP HIS ADHERENTS TO ARMS THE RESOURCES OF THIS PRINCE'S GENIUS INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
NEAR THE MOIETY TOO OF THE LOWER HOUSE ABSENTED THEMSELVES FROM COUNSELS WHICH THEY DEEMED SO FULL OF DANGER THE COMMONS SENT UP AN IMPEACHMENT AGAINST NINE PEERS FOR DESERTING THEIR DUTY IN PARLIAMENT
THE LAST PARLIAMENT OF JAMES AMIDST ALL THEIR JOY AND FESTIVITY HAD GIVEN HIM A SUPPLY VERY DISPROPORTIONED TO HIS DEMAND AND TO THE OCCASION AND AS EVERY HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH WAS ELECTED DURING FORTY YEARS
HE TOO EITHER FROM VANITY OR POLITICS HAD VENTURED TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN BUT A PRIEST PAST MIDDLE AGE OF A SEVERE CHARACTER AND OCCUPIED IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE PLANS OF AMBITION OR VENGEANCE
OF FALLING ON THE REAR OF THE ROYALISTS HE WAS REPULSED ROUTED AND PURSUED WITH CONSIDERABLE LOSS STUNNED AND DISHEARTENED WITH THIS BLOW HIS ARMY DECAYED AND MELTED AWAY BY DESERTION AND THE KING THOUGHT HE MIGHT SAFELY LEAVE IT
HOW COULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE CONSIDERED AS TREASON AFTER THE ACT OF OBLIVION WHICH HAD PASSED AND AFTER THAT BOTH HOUSES WITH THE KING'S CONCURRENCE HAD VOTED THAT NATION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THEIR BROTHERLY ASSISTANCE
THEY MADE A DEMAND THE MOST ABSURD IN THE WORLD THAT THE BISHOPS BEING ALL OF THEM PARTIES SHOULD BE REFUSED A VOTE WITH REGARD TO THAT QUESTION AFTER THE RESOLUTION WAS ONCE FORMED BY THE COMMONS
HAD DONE WISELY ON THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE WAR IN ENGAGING SEVERAL OF ITS MEMBERS IN THE MOST DANGEROUS PARTS OF IT AND THEREBY SATISFYING THE NATION THAT THEY INTENDED TO SHARE ALL HAZARDS WITH THE MEANEST OF THE PEOPLE BUT AFFAIRS ARE NOW CHANGED DURING THE PROGRESS OF MILITARY OPERATIONS
WHO WERE SEATED ON THE STAGE IN A SEMICIRCLE FACING THE AUDIENCE AND STROKING EACH ONE'S HEAD AND FOREHEAD REPEATING THE PHRASES CLOSE YOUR EYES THINK OF NOTHING BUT SLEEP YOU ARE VERY TIRED YOU ARE DROWSY
SUCH A CONDITION I SAY IS ALWAYS SUBJECTIVE IT IS INDEPENDENT OF PASSES OR GESTURES IT HAS NO RELATION TO ANY FLUID EMANATING FROM THE OPERATOR IT HAS NO RELATION TO HIS WILL
AND POSSIBLY PREY UPON THE POCKETS OF A CREDULOUS AND WONDER LOVING PUBLIC SUCH NAMES AS MESMERIC CONDITION MAGNETIC SLEEP CLAIRVOYANCE ELECTRO BIOLOGY ANIMAL MAGNETISM FAITH TRANCE AND MANY OTHER ALIASES
THE MANNER IN WHICH LITTLE BY LITTLE HE VENTURED UPON A FAMILIAR FOOTING WAS EXCEEDINGLY FUNNY BUT WHEN IN A MOMENT OF CONFIDENT RESPONSE TO HIS WOOING HE CLASPED HER ROUND THE WAIST AND IMPRINTED A CHASTE KISS UPON THE BRUSHY PART OF THE BROOM
AND HOW IT EXTENDS TO THE PROFESSIONAL SUBJECTS AS WELL AS TO THE PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS TILL THOSE SUBJECTS EVEN IMPOSE UPON SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO OUGHT TO BE PROOF AGAINST SUCH DECEPTION
IN WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE EFFECTS OF MUSIC UPON HYPNOTIC SUBJECTS WHILE IN VIENNA HE TOOK OCCASION TO OBSERVE CLOSELY THE ENTHUSIASTIC MUSICAL DEVOTEES AS THEY SAT IN THE AUDIENCE AT THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF WAGNER'S OPERAS
THEIR IMPERSONATIONS ARE RIDICULOUS IN THE EXTREME ONE MAN I REMEMBER BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLES SUMNER BEING UNEDUCATED HE USED THE MOST WRETCHED ENGLISH
THIS PROVES THAT IT HAS IMPRESSED HIS SENSIBILITY HE HAS FELT BUT NOT PERCEIVED IT HE HAD ACTUALLY IGNORED IT REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE IT AS IT WERE DOCTOR ERNEST HART AN ENGLISH WRITER
TO THE SWALLOWS FLUTTERING CRAZILY AGAINST THE TINY PANES
SIDNEY SAID MIRIAM SIMPLY NONSENSE
AGAIN HE ASKED HIMSELF WHAT MADNESS HAD COME OVER HIM AND AGAIN FOR AN ANSWER ROSE UP THE VISION OF MAGDALEN CRAWFORD'S FACE AS HE HAD SEEN IT THAT DAY CRIMSONING BENEATH HIS GAZE IT WAS LATE WHEN HE LEFT
THAT IS BEST SHE ANSWERED AT LAST SLOWLY BEST YES BETTER THAT WE HAD NEVER MET I LOVE YOU YOU KNOW IT WORDS ARE IDLE BETWEEN US
THOUGH NOT UNTIL MY SCANTY PATIENCE WAS WELL NIGH WEARIED OUT
SINCE COMING HERE I FIND IT OF GREAT SERVICE TO ME SHE STEPPED LIGHTLY INTO THE TINY SHALLOP AND PICKED UP AN OAR THE BRILLIANT SUNSHINE STREAMED ABOUT HER
HIS SUDDEN SPRING HAD SET IT ROCKING VIOLENTLY MAGDALEN ALMOST LOST HER FOOTING AND CAUGHT BLINDLY AT HIS ARM AS HER FINGERS CLOSED ON HIS WRIST A THRILL AS OF FIRE SHOT THROUGH HIS EVERY VEIN
YOU MUST NOT GO AWAY MAGDALEN YOU MUST STAY HERE WITH ME YOU FORGET YOURSELF SHE SAID PROUDLY HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME SO HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN MISS LESLEY OR ARE YOU A TRAITOR TO US BOTH
AND SHE LIVED A GAY AND QUITE IRREPROACHABLE LIFE SHE WISHED THAT SHE HAD NOT COME TO THE RACES IT WAS SUCH AN IRRITATING ENCOUNTER
AND BILLY OBEYED WITHOUT SPEAKING WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THIS CRAGGS SAID THE VISCOUNT TREMBLING WITH PASSION WHO HAVE YOU BROUGHT ME WHAT BEGGAR HAVE YOU PICKED OFF THE HIGHWAY OR IS HE THE TRAVELLING FOOL OF THE DISTRICT
BUT THE ANGER THAT SUPPLIED STRENGTH HITHERTO NOW FAILED TO IMPART ENERGY AND HE SANK BACK WASTED AND EXHAUSTED THE CORPORAL BENT OVER HIM AND SPOKE SOMETHING IN A LOW WHISPER BUT WHETHER THE WORDS WERE HEARD OR NOT THE SICK MAN NOW LAY STILL
AND WITH AN APPETITE THAT SHOWED HOW MUCH HE RELISHED IT THIS IS ELEGANT LIVING YE HAVE HERE MISTER CRAGGS SAID BILLY AS HE DRAINED HIS TANKARD OF BEER AND PLACED IT WITH A SIGH ON THE TABLE MANY HAPPY YEARS OF IT TO YE I
SAID BILLY AND AFTER ALL I DON'T SEE HOW IT WOULD RESOLVE THE ORIGINAL DOUBT SAID HARCOURT I WANT TO KNOW WHY THE PEOPLE ARE SO POOR
THE FELLOW WHO WROTE IT MUST BE AN ASS
BUT WHILE THEY HESITATED OVER THE REPRIEVE THE PRISONER WAS BEYOND THE LAW THE GATE OF THE PALACE LOCKED AND BARRED ALL DAY REFUSED ENTRANCE TO EVERY ONE AT NIGHT IT OPENED TO ADMIT THE EXIT OF A TRAVELLING CARRIAGE
I FOUND GLENCORE TERRIBLY ALTERED
POOR FELLOW HE LOOKS VERY ILL TO DAY HE SAYS THAT HE NEVER SLEPT THE WHOLE NIGHT AND THAT THE LAUDANUM HE TOOK TO INDUCE DROWSINESS ONLY EXCITED AND MADDENED HIM I COUNSELLED A HOT JORUM OF MULLED PORTER BEFORE GETTING INTO BED
AND BLENDED IN WITH THE SLIGHT SPLASH OF OARS THAT MOVED THROUGH THE WATER CAREFULLY AS THOUGH NOT TO LOSE A WORD OF HIM THAT WAS SPEAKIN IT'S CLEAN BEYOND ME TO TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID AND MAYBE IF I COULD
I WAS THAT FRIGHTENED AND I GOT INTO A CAB JUST AS I WAS
HE DREW ONE OUT AND THREW IT UP TO ME MY SECOND BALL WAS A COLOURABLE IMITATION OF MY FIRST ONLY THIS TIME IT WAS WIDE TO LEG TO LONG LEG MISTER BENYON SENT IT FLYING PUT DOWN TOM BENYON ANOTHER SIX HE CRIED I DO LIKE YOUR BOWLING MISTER
FOR MY CHARACTER'S SAKE I AM BUT BEGINNING YOU PERCEIVE OH YOU'RE BUT BEGINNING YOU CALL THIS BUT BEGINNING DO YOU MAY I ASK IF YOU HAVE ANY INTENTION OF GOING ON
IN FACT IN A RANGE OF SUBJECTS WHICH I WILL NOT EVEN VENTURE TO ENUMERATE THEY REFUSED ME ONE SOLITARY PASS THEY PLUCKED ME IN THEM ALL IT DID NOT ADD TO MY SENSE OF SATISFACTION
THERE WAS AGAIN A SUSPICION OF A SMILE IN HIS EYES AND ABOUT THE CORNERS OF HIS LIPS HIS BEARING WAS IN STRIKING CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE OFFICIALS HIS SELF POSSESSION IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR EVIDENT UNEASINESS
A SUSPICION THAT A MAN MIGHT BE SO REGARDED HAD BEEN DAWNING UPON ME EVER SINCE I ARRIVED IN INDIA BUT UNTIL I CAME TO AHMEDNUGGER
THE END WILL NOT BE LONG THE PRISONER SEEMED LOST IN REFLECTION THE OFFICIALS SEEMED LOST IN REFLECTION TOO BUT THEIR REFLECTIONS WERE PROBABLY OF A DIFFERENT KIND
NOW HE HAD ON A BRIGHT RED FLANNEL SHIRT HIS TASTES IN COSTUME SEEMED A TRIFLE LURID THE SLEEVES OF WHICH WERE TURNED UP ABOVE THE ELBOWS HIS POSE WAS ALMOST AS PECULIAR AS HIS COSTUME HE STOOD BOLT UPRIGHT
HE HAS NEVER GIVEN ME NOTHING WHICH HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO PAY FOR NOT EVEN HALF A PINT OF BEER SO I WAS NOT SURPRISED WHEN HE SAID THE FACT IS MATILDA' WHICH IS ME
THIS WAS PUT IN CONTRAST WITH INTEREST FOR MONEY AND CAPITAL AND WITH WAGES OF LABOR THIS MEANING IS NOW BEING ABANDONED BY ECONOMIC STUDENTS A WIDER MEANING RECENTLY GIVEN TO THE WORD BY MANY ECONOMISTS
THE WORDS OF THE FORMAL DEFINITION OF ECONOMICS SHOULD AT THIS POINT CONVEY A FULLER MEANING IN THE WIDE RANGE OF SUBJECTS PASSED IN REVIEW
IS A RESULT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY THAT IS UNDESIGNED BY THE GOVERNMENT OR BY SOCIETY IT IS EXCEPTIONAL CONSIDERING THE WHOLE RANGE OF PRIVATE PROPERTY BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THE OIL WELLS EMBRACING THE MAIN SOURCES OF THE WORLD'S SUPPLY
MAY BE RELATIVELY PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY BUSINESS CONDITIONS SOMETIMES CHANGE QUICKLY AN URGENT DEMAND FOR SPECIAL MACHINERY RAISES QUICKLY ITS RENT AND VALUE
MOREOVER THE PATENT IS LIMITED IN TIME EXPIRES AND BECOMES A SOCIAL POSSESSION A THIRD KIND IS A GOVERNMENT MONOPOLY FOR PURPOSES OF REVENUE IN FRANCE THE GOVERNMENT CONTROLS THE TOBACCO TRADE
WHERE THE USE OF A PERMANENT FORM OF WEALTH SUCH AS A PARK CAN BE MADE FREE TO THE PUBLIC ALL INDIVIDUALS MAY ENJOY EQUAL PRIVILEGES THOUGH GENERAL RULES MAY LIMIT THE KIND OF USE FOR EXAMPLE
THREE AMONG THE MAIN SOURCES OF POWER USED BY MEN ARE FOOD DOMESTIC ANIMALS AND FUEL IN EATING FOOD MAN STORES UP FORCE IN HIS OWN BODY WHEN HE DRAWS THE BOW
CONSTANT WORK IS NEEDED TO KEEP IT FIT AND SAFE FOR USE ABOVE THIS IS THE TRACK SLIGHTLY LESS PERMANENT MORE FREQUENTLY CHANGED THE TIES ROT AND EVEN THE RAILS OF STEEL MUST BE AT TIMES REPLACED
AS THE USE OF MONEY DEVELOPS AS COMMERCE EXTENDS TO MORE DISTANT LANDS THE HEAVIER LESS PRECIOUS METALS FAIL TO SERVE THE MONEY NEED ESPECIALLY IN THE LARGER TRANSACTIONS
PATTED IT ABOUT TILL THE WIRES BROKE AND SET THOMAS AT LIBERTY THE KING RECEIVED TOM AGAIN INTO FAVOR WHICH HE DID NOT LIVE TO ENJOY FOR A LARGE SPIDER ONE DAY ATTACKED HIM AND ALTHOUGH HE DREW HIS SWORD AND FOUGHT WELL
AND THE OLD PEOPLE PERSISTED
BUT SHE DETERMINED TO BEAR IT GLADLY IF SHE COULD ONLY RELEASE HER DEAR BROTHERS SO SHE BRUISED THE NETTLES WITH HER BARE FEET AND SPUN THE FLAX AT SUNSET HER BROTHERS RETURNED
AND FLAPPED THEIR GREAT WHITE WINGS AS SOON AS THE SUN HAD DISAPPEARED UNDER THE WATER THE FEATHERS OF THE SWANS FELL OFF AND ELEVEN BEAUTIFUL PRINCES
THE CHARCOAL BURNERS SING THE OLD SONGS TO WHICH WE HAVE DANCED AS CHILDREN THIS IS OUR FATHERLAND TO WHICH WE ARE DRAWN BY LOVING TIES AND HERE WE HAVE FOUND YOU OUR DEAR LITTLE SISTER
I SHALL NOT BE READY TO COME HOME AND THAT SHE MAY NOT LOSE HER WAY I WILL TAKE WITH ME A BAG OF SEEDS AND STREW THEM ON MY PATH SO WHEN THE SUN WAS RISEN TO THE CENTER OF THE HEAVENS THE MAIDEN SET OUT ON HER WAY CARRYING A JUG OF SOUP
PEOPLE MUST DWELL THERE SHE THOUGHT WHO WILL KEEP ME DURING THE NIGHT AND SHE WALKED TOWARD THE LIGHT IN A SHORT TIME SHE CAME TO A COTTAGE WHERE THE WINDOWS WERE ALL LIGHTED UP AND WHEN SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR A HOARSE VOICE CALLED FROM WITHIN
BUT THE BOOK THAT HE COULD NOT GET TRIED JUST THEN THEN THEY SAILED WELL AND FAR TILL A STORM OVERTOOK THEM WHICH LASTED MANY DAYS SO THEY LAY TO AND DROVE TILL
WHETHER THEY WERE DEWDROPS OR TEARS NO ONE COULD SAY LONELY AS IT WAS ON THE SEASHORE SHE DID NOT OBSERVE IT FOR THE EVER MOVING SEA SHOWED MORE CHANGES IN A FEW HOURS
WHICH THE HEROES OF THE PLAY SUFFER OR HAS HIS SYMPATHY TOUCHED BY THE VIRTUES
WE CANNOT SAY I AM NOT WILLING TO LEND YOU THIS WORK BUT IF THE BORROWER IS A SUSPICIOUS PERSON WE CAN SAY WE HAVE OCCASION TO USE IT THAT WE REGRET IT VERY MUCH BUT THAT WE WILL LEND IT TO HIM IN A FEW DAYS
IF THE PERSON ADDRESSED HAS A TITLE OR THAT WHICH HE HAS FROM HIS PROFESSION WE SHOULD GIVE IT HIM AS COUNT DOCTOR
NOR SPEAK TO THEM UNTIL THEY HAVE SEPARATED PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED A LITTLE IN THE WORLD KNOW HOW ESSENTIAL IT IS NOT TO MINGLE WITH CURIOSITY IN THE BUSINESS OF PERSONS WHOM WE VISIT
GENTLEMEN MAY CALL IN AN OUTSIDE COAT IN BOOTS AND PANTALOONS AS WHEN THEY ARE ON THEIR ORDINARY BUSINESS IN SHORT THIS DRESS IS PROPER FOR GENTLEMEN'S VISITS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY
IF PERCEIVING THAT YOU ARE EMBARRASSED AND THAT YOU ENDEAVOR TO SAVE YOURSELF BY AN EVASIVE ANSWER INSTEAD OF KEEPING SILENCE YOU WITNESS THE FOOLISH REGRETS OF YOUR INDISCRETION BE ASSURED THAT BOTH YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOURSELF
IT WILL BE ENOUGH TO MENTION SUCH IMPERTINENCE IN ORDER TO DESPISE IT AS WE OUGHT AS TO THOSE YOUNG MEN WHO ENTERTAIN A FALSE IDEA THAT PARISIAN LADIES ARE COQUETTES OR FORWARD IN THEIR MANNERS AND BESIDES THAT EVERYTHING IS ALLOWABLE IN A LARGE CITY
SO THAT WHEN YOU HAVE ANYTHING EXCELLENT TO RELATE CONSULT LESS YOUR OWN DESIRE TO TELL IT THAN THE WISHES OF OTHERS TO HEAR YOU THERE ARE BUT TOO MANY PEOPLE WHO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF WEARYING WHILE TELLING VERY GOOD THINGS
OR EXPOSE THEMSELVES EVERY DAY FOR A SARCASM TO SPORT WITH THEIR OWN LIFE AND THAT OF ANOTHER IN A DUEL SUCH PEOPLE WHAT ARE THEY IN TRUTH I DARE NOT SAY ONE SUCH PICTURE WHICH CERTAINLY IS NOT HIGHLY COLORED
IT HAD BEEN MEANT FOR THE HARDY TURKISH SOLDIERY TO SLEEP IN AND THERE WERE NO APPLIANCES TO FIT IT FOR A HOSPITAL WE ARE TOLD THAT IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE WAR THERE WERE NO VESSELS FOR WATER OR UTENSILS OF ANY KIND
WHILE NEITHER GAINED ANY SIGNAL ADVANTAGE
AND THE MODERN NURSE EDUCATED METHODICAL CLEAR EYED AND CLEAR HEADED TOOK HER PLACE QUIETLY ONE OF THE GREAT CHANGES OF MODERN TIMES WAS EFFECTED AND THE HAND THAT DIRECTED IT WAS THE SAME ONE THAT WE HAVE SEEN HOLDING THE LAMP
SENT HER BY THE SULTAN OF TURKEY I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY MORE JEWELS BUT TWO GIFTS THAT MISS NIGHTINGALE PRIZED HIGHLY
AND MORE PLEASE HORSE LANGUAGE IS A SIMPLE ONE COMPARED TO ENGLISH AND HAS NO GRAMMAR WELL ONE DAY FLORENCE WAS RIDING HER PONY IN COMPANY WITH HER FRIEND THE VICAR THIS GOOD MAN LOVED ALL LIVING CREATURES
BOTH OWED THEIR FIRST IMPULSE TO THE PEBBLE DROPPED BY FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE EVEN HER OWN LIFE GIVEN FREELY TO SUFFERING HUMANITY
CANNON TO RIGHT OF THEM CANNON TO LEFT OF THEM CANNON BEHIND THEM VOLLEYED AND THUNDERED STORMED AT WITH SHOT AND SHELL WHILE HORSE AND HERO FELL THEY THAT HAD FOUGHT SO WELL
AS THE HEAT DREW OUT THE INFLAMMATION AND PAIN CAP LOOKED UP AT THE LITTLE HELPER ALL HIS SIMPLE DOG HEART SHINING IN HIS EYES THE LOOK SANK INTO THE CHILD'S HEART AND DEEPENED THE TENDERNESS ALREADY THERE ANOTHER STEP
