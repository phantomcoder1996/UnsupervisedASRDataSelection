ACCORDINGLY I HID MYSELF IN SOME THICK UNDERWOOD DETERMINING TO DEVOTE THE ENSUING HOURS TO REFLECTION ON MY SITUATION THE PLEASANT SUNSHINE AND THE PURE AIR OF DAY RESTORED ME TO SOME DEGREE OF TRANQUILLITY
THUS I RETURNED HOME AND ENTERING THE HOUSE PRESENTED MYSELF TO THE FAMILY MY HAGGARD AND WILD APPEARANCE AWOKE INTENSE ALARM BUT I ANSWERED NO QUESTION SCARCELY DID I SPEAK
UGLY WRETCH YOU WISH TO EAT ME AND TEAR ME TO PIECES YOU ARE AN OGRE LET ME GO OR I WILL TELL MY PAPA BOY YOU WILL NEVER SEE YOUR FATHER AGAIN YOU MUST COME WITH ME HIDEOUS MONSTER LET ME GO
SPREAD HAVOC AND DESTRUCTION AROUND ME AND THEN TO HAVE SAT DOWN AND ENJOYED THE RUIN BUT THIS WAS A LUXURY OF SENSATION THAT COULD NOT ENDURE
SUCH AS WOULD ALONE COMPENSATE FOR THE OUTRAGES AND ANGUISH I HAD ENDURED AFTER SOME WEEKS MY WOUND HEALED AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY
AND WHY DO YOU AGAIN HARDEN YOURSELF TO MY COMPLAINTS I SWEAR TO YOU BY THE EARTH WHICH I INHABIT AND BY YOU THAT MADE ME THAT WITH THE COMPANION YOU BESTOW I WILL QUIT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF MAN AND DWELL AS IT MAY CHANCE
I WILL WORK AT YOUR DESTRUCTION NOR FINISH UNTIL I DESOLATE YOUR HEART SO THAT YOU SHALL CURSE THE HOUR OF YOUR BIRTH A FIENDISH RAGE ANIMATED HIM AS HE SAID THIS
WHEN NIGHT CAME I QUITTED MY RETREAT AND WANDERED IN THE WOOD AND NOW NO LONGER RESTRAINED BY THE FEAR OF DISCOVERY I GAVE VENT TO MY ANGUISH IN FEARFUL HOWLINGS
I DO NOT INTEND TO HURT YOU LISTEN TO ME
PRESENTLY TWO COUNTRYMEN PASSED BY BUT PAUSING NEAR THE COTTAGE THEY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION USING VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS BUT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY SAID AS THEY SPOKE THE LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY
ALREADY SHOWN A DEGREE OF MALICE THAT SHOULD REASONABLY MAKE ME DISTRUST YOU MAY NOT EVEN THIS BE A FEINT THAT WILL INCREASE YOUR TRIUMPH BY AFFORDING A WIDER SCOPE FOR YOUR REVENGE HOW IS THIS
I HAD NO RIGHT TO WITHHOLD FROM HIM THE SMALL PORTION OF HAPPINESS WHICH WAS YET IN MY POWER TO BESTOW YOU SWEAR I SAID TO BE HARMLESS BUT HAVE YOU NOT
SET ON BY THAT WRETCH THORN MISTER CARLYLE TURNED TO THE SIDEBOARD AND POURED OUT A WINEGLASS OF BRANDY DRINK IT RICHARD IT WILL WARM YOU I'D RATHER HAVE IT IN SOME HOT WATER SIR
WHO WOULD RECOGNIZE ME SO I HAVE KEPT MOSTLY IN OBSCURE PLACES STABLES AND SUCH LIKE I HAD GONE UP TO THE WEST END THIS DAY ON A MATTER OF BUSINESS WELL GO ON WITH YOUR STORY
MISS CARLYLE HAS LEFT HER HANDKERCHIEF DOWNSTAIRS SIR AND HAS SENT ME FOR IT YOU CANNOT COME IN I AM BUSY WAS THE ANSWER DELIVERED IN A CLEAR AND MOST DECISIVE TONE
AND YOU MIGHT JUST HAVE KNOCKED ME DOWN WITH ASTONISHMENT MISTER CARLYLE IT WAS THE MAN THORN INDEED YOU THOUGHT I MIGHT BE MISTAKEN IN HIM THAT MOONLIGHT NIGHT
SHE COULD NOT HELP BEING VEXED AT THE NON APPEARANCE OF MISTER THORPE FOR SHE NOT ONLY LONGED TO BE DANCING BUT WAS LIKEWISE AWARE THAT AS THE REAL DIGNITY OF HER SITUATION COULD NOT BE KNOWN
ROSE AND STRETCHED HIMSELF AS IF TIRED OF SITTING HE STIRRED THE FIRE INTO A BRIGHTER BLAZE AND STOOD ON THE HEARTHRUG I WONDER IF IT SNOWS STILL HE EXCLAIMED TO HIMSELF
WE DIDN'T GO MUCH MORE THAN THE LENGTH OF A STREET I WAS ON THE PAVEMENT BEFORE THORN WAS AND LOOKED AT HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN HE WENT WHITE I MARKED THE HOUSE THINKING IT WAS WHERE HE LIVED AND
TO A PLEASANTER FEELING BY SEEING NOT MISTER THORPE BUT MISTER TILNEY WITHIN THREE YARDS OF THE PLACE WHERE THEY SAT HE SEEMED TO BE MOVING THAT WAY BUT HE DID NOT SEE HER AND THEREFORE THE SMILE AND THE BLUSH
WHEN SHE WAS IN ONE OF HER RESOLUTE MOODS WOULD BE OF NO USE MISTER CARLYLE OPENED THE DOOR DEXTEROUSLY SWUNG HIMSELF THROUGH IT AND SHUT IT AFTER HIM
THAT SHE WAS ALONE AT THE BACK OF THE COTTAGE AND KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT TILL AFTERWARDS HOW COULD SHE HAVE SWORN SHE WAS ALONE IF THORN WAS WITH HER THE FACT HAD ENTIRELY ESCAPED MISTER CARLYLE'S MEMORY IN HIS CONVERSATION WITH AFY
OF HER DEAR ISABELLA TO WHOM SHE PARTICULARLY LONGED TO POINT OUT THAT GENTLEMAN SHE COULD SEE NOTHING THEY WERE IN DIFFERENT SETS SHE WAS SEPARATED FROM ALL HER PARTY AND AWAY FROM ALL HER ACQUAINTANCE ONE MORTIFICATION SUCCEEDED ANOTHER
HER CHEST SORE AND HER VOICE GOING IN SHORT AT HAVING FOR ONCE IN HER LIFE CAUGHT A COLD LIKE ORDINARY MORTALS WHAT'S THE TIME I WONDER SHE EXCLAIMED
HE MAY HAVE BROUGHT HALF A DOZEN MORE WITH HIM GASPED THE UNHAPPY RICHARD I SAID THEY MIGHT HAVE DODGED ME ALL THE WAY HERE NONSENSE SIT YOU DOWN AND BE AT REST IT IS ONLY CORNELIA
WHAT I SAY IS WHY SHOULD A BROTHER'S HAPPINESS BE DEARER TO ME THAN A FRIEND'S YOU KNOW I CARRY MY NOTIONS OF FRIENDSHIP PRETTY HIGH
IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING WHICH SAW THIS BUSINESS ARRANGED SHE VISITED MISS TILNEY AND POURED FORTH HER JOYFUL FEELINGS IT WAS DOOMED TO BE A DAY OF TRIAL NO SOONER HAD SHE EXPRESSED HER DELIGHT IN MISTER ALLEN'S LENGTHENED STAY
AND IT WAS BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE LEFT BATH THAT YOU GAVE HIM THE MOST POSITIVE ENCOURAGEMENT HE SAYS SO IN THIS LETTER SAYS THAT HE AS GOOD AS MADE YOU AN OFFER
HER FEELINGS HER PREFERENCES HAD EACH KNOWN THE HAPPINESS OF A RETURN WHEREVER SHE FELT ATTACHMENT SHE HAD BEEN ABLE TO CREATE IT THE AFFECTION OF ISABELLA WAS TO BE SECURED TO HER IN A SISTER THE TILNEYS
THAN MISS TILNEY TOLD HER OF HER FATHER'S HAVING JUST DETERMINED UPON QUITTING BATH BY THE END OF ANOTHER WEEK HERE WAS A BLOW THE PAST SUSPENSE OF THE MORNING HAD BEEN EASE AND QUIET TO THE PRESENT DISAPPOINTMENT
FOUND THEMSELVES SO WELL SUFFICIENT FOR THE TIME TO THEMSELVES THAT IT WAS ELEVEN O'CLOCK RATHER A LATE HOUR AT THE ABBEY BEFORE THEY QUITTED THE SUPPER ROOM ON THE DAY OF HENRY'S DEPARTURE THEY HAD JUST REACHED THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS WHEN IT SEEMED
I AM ALMOST ASHAMED TO MAKE THE REQUEST THOUGH
BUT I CONFESS AS SOON AS I READ HIS LETTER I THOUGHT IT A VERY FOOLISH IMPRUDENT BUSINESS AND NOT LIKELY TO PROMOTE THE GOOD OF EITHER FOR WHAT WERE YOU TO LIVE UPON SUPPOSING YOU CAME TOGETHER YOU HAVE BOTH OF YOU SOMETHING TO BE SURE
WITH ALL THE CHANCES AGAINST HER OF HOUSE HALL PLACE PARK COURT AND COTTAGE NORTHANGER TURNED UP AN ABBEY AND SHE WAS TO BE ITS INHABITANT ITS LONG DAMP PASSAGES ITS NARROW CELLS
THOUGH SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED IN SPEAKING OF IT HAD OCCURRED TO HER THAT AFTER SO LONG AN ABSENCE FROM HOME CATHERINE MIGHT NOT BE PROVIDED WITH MONEY ENOUGH FOR THE EXPENSES OF HER JOURNEY AND UPON SUGGESTING IT TO HER WITH MOST AFFECTIONATE OFFERS OF ACCOMMODATION
SHE PAUSED A MOMENT AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS JUST MADE IT INTELLIGIBLE THAT SHE LEFT HER KIND REMEMBRANCE FOR HER ABSENT FRIEND
THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ME MY HEART INDEED WHAT CAN YOU HAVE TO DO WITH HEARTS YOU MEN HAVE NONE OF YOU ANY HEARTS IF WE HAVE NOT HEARTS WE HAVE EYES AND THEY GIVE US TORMENT ENOUGH
AH HERE HE COMES NEVER MIND HE WILL NOT SEE US I AM SURE CATHERINE LOOKING UP PERCEIVED CAPTAIN TILNEY AND ISABELLA EARNESTLY FIXING HER EYE ON HIM AS SHE SPOKE SOON CAUGHT HIS NOTICE
TO YOUR FAMILY TO THE WORLD WERE YOUR FRIENDS THE ALLENS STILL IN BATH YOU MIGHT GO TO THEM WITH COMPARATIVE EASE A FEW HOURS WOULD TAKE YOU THERE BUT A JOURNEY OF SEVENTY MILES TO BE TAKEN POST BY YOU AT YOUR AGE ALONE UNATTENDED
LOOKED AT HER ANXIOUSLY CATHERINE TOOK HER PLACE AT THE TABLE AND AFTER A SHORT SILENCE ELEANOR SAID NO BAD NEWS FROM FULLERTON I HOPE MISTER AND MISSUS MORLAND YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS I HOPE THEY ARE NONE OF THEM ILL
JAMES ONLY MEANS TO GIVE ME GOOD ADVICE HE GLADLY RECEIVED THE LETTER AND HAVING READ IT THROUGH WITH CLOSE ATTENTION RETURNED IT SAYING WELL IF IT IS TO BE SO I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I AM SORRY FOR IT
SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO FORGIVE HERSELF AND BE HAPPIER THAN EVER AND THE LENIENT HAND OF TIME DID MUCH FOR HER BY INSENSIBLE GRADATIONS IN THE COURSE OF ANOTHER DAY HENRY'S ASTONISHING GENEROSITY
THAN IF I POSSESSED A WATCH FOR THAT MIGHT BE BROKEN OR DERANGED IN ITS MOVEMENTS WHILE THE SUN AND EARTH NEVER VARY IN THEIR APPOINTED PATHS THIS LAST EXPLANATION WAS WHOLLY LOST UPON DANTES WHO HAD ALWAYS IMAGINED
I WROTE THE WORD FINIS AT THE END OF THE SIXTY EIGHTH STRIP ABOUT A WEEK AGO I HAVE TORN UP TWO OF MY SHIRTS AND AS MANY HANDKERCHIEFS AS I WAS MASTER OF TO COMPLETE THE PRECIOUS PAGES
I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE YOUR TREASURES THE ABBE SMILED AND PROCEEDING TO THE DISUSED FIREPLACE RAISED BY THE HELP OF HIS CHISEL A LONG STONE WHICH HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN THE HEARTH BENEATH WHICH WAS A CAVITY OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH
I SEPARATED THE FAT FROM THE MEAT SERVED TO ME MELTED IT AND SO MADE OIL HERE IS MY LAMP SO SAYING THE ABBE EXHIBITED A SORT OF TORCH VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN PUBLIC ILLUMINATIONS
LET ME SOON HEAR FROM YOU DEAR CATHERINE YOU ARE MY ONLY FRIEND YOUR LOVE I DO BUILD UPON I WISH YOUR VISIT AT NORTHANGER MAY BE OVER BEFORE CAPTAIN TILNEY MAKES HIS ENGAGEMENT KNOWN
WILL YOU TAKE THE TROUBLE OF READING TO US THE PASSAGES WHICH CONCERN MY BROTHER NO READ IT YOURSELF CRIED CATHERINE WHOSE SECOND THOUGHTS WERE CLEARER I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING OF BLUSHING AGAIN THAT SHE HAD BLUSHED BEFORE
INDEED I AM AFRAID SHE WILL REPLIED HENRY I AM AFRAID SHE WILL BE VERY CONSTANT UNLESS A BARONET SHOULD COME IN HER WAY THAT IS FREDERICK'S ONLY CHANCE I WILL GET THE BATH PAPER AND LOOK OVER THE ARRIVALS
WHICH HE COULD JUST RECOLLECT HAVING VISITED DURING A VOYAGE MADE IN HIS EARLIEST YOUTH
IT IS ALL OVER WITH FREDERICK INDEED HE IS A DECEASED MAN DEFUNCT IN UNDERSTANDING PREPARE FOR YOUR SISTER IN LAW ELEANOR AND SUCH A SISTER IN LAW AS YOU MUST DELIGHT IN OPEN CANDID
ASKED THE ABBE OH YOUR GREAT WORK ON THE MONARCHY OF ITALY
MISTER THORPE IS SUCH A VERY PARTICULAR FRIEND OF MY BROTHER'S THAT IF HE TALKS TO ME I MUST TALK TO HIM AGAIN BUT THERE ARE HARDLY THREE YOUNG MEN IN THE ROOM BESIDES HIM THAT I HAVE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH AND IS THAT TO BE MY ONLY SECURITY ALAS ALAS
IN MARRIAGE THE MAN IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE WOMAN THE WOMAN TO MAKE THE HOME AGREEABLE TO THE MAN HE IS TO PURVEY AND SHE IS TO SMILE BUT IN DANCING THEIR DUTIES ARE EXACTLY CHANGED
BEFORE SHE REMEMBERED THAT HER ELDEST BROTHER HAD LATELY FORMED AN INTIMACY WITH A YOUNG MAN OF HIS OWN COLLEGE OF THE NAME OF THORPE
NOW MISTER MORLAND FOR HE WAS CLOSE TO HER ON THE OTHER SIDE I SHALL NOT SPEAK ANOTHER WORD TO YOU ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING SO I CHARGE YOU NOT TO EXPECT IT MY SWEETEST CATHERINE HOW HAVE YOU BEEN THIS LONG AGE
ALL HAVE BEEN OR AT LEAST ALL HAVE BELIEVED THEMSELVES TO BE IN DANGER FROM THE PURSUIT OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY WISHED TO AVOID AND ALL HAVE BEEN ANXIOUS FOR THE ATTENTIONS OF SOMEONE WHOM THEY
WHICH I CAN KNOW NOTHING OF THERE YOU ARE NOT FOND OF THE COUNTRY YES I AM I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED THERE AND ALWAYS BEEN VERY HAPPY
WELL OTHER PEOPLE MUST JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THOSE WHO GO TO LONDON MAY THINK NOTHING OF BATH BUT I WHO LIVE IN A SMALL RETIRED VILLAGE IN THE COUNTRY CAN NEVER FIND GREATER SAMENESS IN SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAN IN MY OWN HOME
FOR IF I DO NOT KNOW ANYBODY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO TALK TO THEM AND BESIDES I DO NOT WANT TO TALK TO ANYBODY NOW YOU HAVE GIVEN ME A SECURITY WORTH HAVING AND I SHALL PROCEED WITH COURAGE
WHAT WOULD NOT I GIVE TO SEE HIM I REALLY AM QUITE WILD WITH IMPATIENCE MY MOTHER SAYS HE IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL YOUNG MAN IN THE WORLD SHE SAW HIM THIS MORNING YOU KNOW YOU MUST INTRODUCE HIM TO ME
I DECLARE POSITIVELY IT IS QUITE SHOCKING I TELL HIM HE OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF BUT YOU AND JOHN MUST KEEP US IN COUNTENANCE MAKE HASTE MY DEAR CREATURE AND COME TO US JOHN IS JUST WALKED OFF BUT HE WILL BE BACK IN A MOMENT
AND WAS NOW CHIEFLY ANXIOUS TO AVOID HIS SIGHT LEST HE SHOULD ENGAGE HER AGAIN FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT DARED NOT EXPECT THAT MISTER TILNEY SHOULD ASK HER A THIRD TIME TO DANCE
REALLY OUR OPINIONS WERE SO EXACTLY THE SAME IT WAS QUITE RIDICULOUS THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE POINT IN WHICH WE DIFFERED I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD YOU BY FOR THE WORLD YOU ARE SUCH A SLY THING I AM SURE YOU WOULD HAVE MADE SOME DROLL REMARK OR OTHER ABOUT IT
SHE CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED IN IT DRESS IS AT ALL TIMES A FRIVOLOUS DISTINCTION AND EXCESSIVE SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT OFTEN DESTROYS ITS OWN AIM CATHERINE KNEW ALL THIS VERY WELL HER GREAT AUNT HAD READ HER A LECTURE ON THE SUBJECT ONLY THE CHRISTMAS BEFORE
THIS WAS JULIE WHO HAD BECOME AS THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF THOMSON AND FRENCH HAD PREDICTED MADAME EMMANUEL HERBAULT SHE UTTERED A CRY OF SURPRISE AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGER AND MAXIMILIAN BEGAN TO LAUGH
BUT HE NEVER HAS ANY REGARD FOR HIS POOR SISTER PENELON PENELON AN OLD MAN WHO WAS DIGGING BUSILY AT ONE OF THE BEDS STUCK HIS SPADE IN THE EARTH AND APPROACHED CAP IN HAND STRIVING TO CONCEAL A QUID OF TOBACCO HE HAD JUST THRUST INTO HIS CHEEK
AND IN THE REAR OF ONE OF THE MOST IMPOSING MANSIONS IN THIS RICH NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE VARIOUS HOUSES VIE WITH EACH OTHER FOR ELEGANCE OF DESIGN AND MAGNIFICENCE OF CONSTRUCTION EXTENDED A LARGE GARDEN
IT OCCURRED TO THE POSSESSOR OF THE PROPERTY THAT A HANDSOME SUM MIGHT BE OBTAINED FOR THE GROUND THEN DEVOTED TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES BY BUILDING ALONG THE LINE OF THE PROPOSED STREET AND SO MAKING IT A BRANCH OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE FAUBOURG SAINT HONORE ITSELF
SUCH FELICITY SEEMS ABOVE ALL PRICE AS A THING IMPOSSIBLE AND UNATTAINABLE BUT WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT I PURCHASE ALL THIS DELIGHT JOY AND HAPPINESS
BUT LISTEN TO ME VALENTINE AND I WILL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT I BECAME WEARY OF RANGING FIELDS AND SCALING WALLS AND SERIOUSLY ALARMED AT THE IDEA SUGGESTED BY YOU THAT IF CAUGHT HOVERING ABOUT HERE YOUR FATHER WOULD VERY LIKELY HAVE ME SENT TO PRISON AS A THIEF
OH MONSIEUR THIS IS CRUEL OF YOU SAID JULIE MUCH AFFECTED AND THE YOUNG LADY'S EYES SWAM WITH TEARS MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO GRAVELY AND GAZING EARNESTLY ON THE TWO LIQUID PEARLS THAT TRICKLED DOWN JULIE'S CHEEKS
NO NO RETURNED MONTE CRISTO PALE AS DEATH PRESSING ONE HAND ON HIS HEART TO STILL ITS THROBBINGS WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE POINTED TO A CRYSTAL COVER BENEATH WHICH A SILKEN PURSE LAY ON A BLACK VELVET CUSHION
AND HAD NOW FALLEN SO COMPLETELY IN GENERAL ESTIMATION AS TO RETURN NOT EVEN THE ONE HALF PER CENT IT HAD ORIGINALLY PAID TOWARDS THE HOUSE THE CHESTNUT TREES WE HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED ROSE HIGH ABOVE THE WALL
WITH A TONE SO SWEET AND GENTLE THAT IT WENT TO MAXIMILIAN'S HEART LIKE THE VOICE OF A FATHER BUT THEY WILL NOT BE CONTENT WITH THAT YOUR BROTHER IN LAW IS A BARRISTER A DOCTOR HE WAS A MERCHANT MONSIEUR AND HAD SUCCEEDED TO THE BUSINESS OF MY POOR FATHER
LEFT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN MY SISTER AND MYSELF FOR WE WERE HIS ONLY CHILDREN HER HUSBAND WHO WHEN HE MARRIED HER HAD NO OTHER PATRIMONY THAN HIS NOBLE PROBITY HIS FIRST RATE ABILITY AND HIS SPOTLESS REPUTATION WISHED TO POSSESS AS MUCH AS HIS WIFE
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO STOP THE ISSUE OF ANY MORE AND CLOSE OUR OFFICE THIS WAS DONE INSTANTLY IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK AT A QUARTER PAST A MERCHANT PRESENTED HIMSELF TO INSURE TWO SHIPS IT WAS A CLEAR PROFIT OF FIFTEEN THOUSAND FRANCS
WHERE HE RECEIVED HIS FRIENDS HE WAS SUPERINTENDING THE GROOMING OF HIS HORSE AND SMOKING HIS CIGAR AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE GARDEN WHEN THE COUNT'S CARRIAGE STOPPED AT THE GATE
THERE IS NO ONE IN THE WORLD OF WHOM I CAN ASK HELP BUT YOURSELF AND MY GRANDFATHER WHO IS LITTLE BETTER THAN A CORPSE
NAY FURTHER HAVE YOU NEVER ENDEAVORED TO RECALL THE TIME PLACE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF YOUR FORMER INTERCOURSE AND FAILING IN THIS ATTEMPT HAVE ALMOST BELIEVED THAT YOUR SPIRITS MUST HAVE HELD CONVERSE WITH EACH OTHER IN SOME STATE OF BEING ANTERIOR TO THE PRESENT
IN HIS MOST SIMPLE ACTIONS AS WELL AS IN HIS MOST SECRET THOUGHTS I FIND A RELATION TO MY OWN
THIS GARDEN HAS NEVER BEEN A CEMETERY WHAT IS DONE TO INFANTICIDES IN THIS COUNTRY ASKED MAJOR CAVALCANTI INNOCENTLY OH THEIR HEADS ARE SOON CUT OFF SAID DANGLARS AH INDEED SAID CAVALCANTI
IT CANNOT BE SURELY VALENTINE YOU ARE MISTAKEN NO INDEED I AM NOT FOR I ASSURE YOU HIS POWER OVER OUR HOUSEHOLD IS ALMOST UNLIMITED COURTED BY MY STEP MOTHER WHO REGARDS HIM AS THE EPITOME OF HUMAN WISDOM
WELL MY MAN DIGGING FOUND A BOX OR RATHER THE IRON WORK OF A BOX IN THE MIDST OF WHICH WAS THE SKELETON OF A NEWLY BORN INFANT MONTE CRISTO FELT THE ARM OF MADAME DANGLARS STIFFEN WHILE THAT OF VILLEFORT TREMBLED
THE LITTLEST FINGER OF ALL THAT I MAY HAVE THE HAPPINESS OF KISSING IT MAXIMILIAN WE SAID WE WOULD BE TO EACH OTHER AS TWO VOICES TWO SHADOWS AS YOU WILL VALENTINE SHALL YOU BE HAPPY IF I DO WHAT YOU WISH OH YES
AND HIS HAND ENDOWED WITH THE POWER OF DIRECTING EVENTS ACCORDING TO HIS OWN WILL HE MUST BE A PROPHET THEN SAID VALENTINE SMILING INDEED SAID MAXIMILIAN I HAVE OFTEN BEEN ALMOST TEMPTED TO ATTRIBUTE TO HIM THE GIFT OF PROPHECY
A CULPRIT TO DEATH YOU M DEBRAY IN PACIFYING A KINGDOM
AND THAT THEIR EXTERIORS CARRIED THE IMPRESS OF THEIR CHARACTERS THIS HOUSE WAS GLOOMY BECAUSE IT WAS REMORSEFUL IT WAS REMORSEFUL BECAUSE IT CONCEALED A CRIME
IT LOOKED SO GLOOMY I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BOUGHT IT IF MY STEWARD HAD NOT TAKEN THE MATTER INTO HIS OWN HANDS PERHAPS THE FELLOW HAD BEEN BRIBED BY THE NOTARY
WHERE THE SHADE WAS THICKEST ALL THE OTHER GUESTS FOLLOWED
AND I AM SURE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SABRING RIGHT AND LEFT AMONG THE BEDOUINS CAN HAVE DONE TO MERIT YOUR BEING REVEALED TO ME UNLESS INDEED HEAVEN TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT THE VICTIMS OF MY SWORD WERE INFIDELS
HALF SCREENED FROM VIEW BY THE LARGE CHESTNUT TREES WHICH ON ALL SIDES SPREAD THEIR LUXURIANT BRANCHES WE SHALL FIND SOME PEOPLE OF OUR ACQUAINTANCE THIS TIME MAXIMILIAN WAS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE
STILL I CANNOT CROSS JOVE NOR BRING HIS COUNSELS TO NOTHING THEREFORE IF HE INSISTS UPON IT LET THE MAN GO BEYOND THE SEAS AGAIN BUT I CANNOT SEND HIM ANYWHERE MYSELF FOR I HAVE NEITHER SHIPS NOR MEN WHO CAN TAKE HIM
I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO AT ONCE REPLIED NEPTUNE IF I WERE NOT ANXIOUS TO AVOID ANYTHING THAT MIGHT DISPLEASE YOU NOW THEREFORE I SHOULD LIKE TO WRECK THE PHAEACIAN SHIP AS IT IS RETURNING FROM ITS ESCORT
AS IT WAS RETURNING FROM AN ESCORT AND BURY OUR CITY UNDER A HIGH MOUNTAIN
THEN THEY WENT TO THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS TO GET DINNER AND HE SACRIFICED A BULL FOR THEM IN HONOUR OF JOVE WHO IS THE LORD OF ALL THEY SET THE STEAKS TO GRILL AND MADE AN EXCELLENT DINNER
AND MAKING ME PRESENTS WHICH HEAVEN GRANT THAT I MAY TURN TO GOOD ACCOUNT
WINDS FROM EAST SOUTH NORTH AND WEST FELL UPON HIM ALL AT THE SAME TIME AND A TREMENDOUS SEA GOT UP SO THAT ULYSSES HEART BEGAN TO FAIL HIM ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY WHAT EVER WILL BECOME OF ME
UPON HIS OWN SOIL HE HAD BEEN SO LONG AWAY THAT HE DID NOT KNOW IT AGAIN MOREOVER
DAYS SEVEN AND TEN DID HE SAIL OVER THE SEA AND ON THE EIGHTEENTH THE DIM OUTLINES OF THE MOUNTAINS ON THE NEAREST PART OF THE PHAEACIAN COAST APPEARED RISING LIKE A SHIELD ON THE HORIZON
THE PRECIPICES AND THE GOODLY TREES APPEARED ALL CHANGED AS HE STARTED UP AND LOOKED UPON HIS NATIVE LAND SO HE SMOTE HIS THIGHS WITH THE FLAT OF HIS HANDS AND CRIED ALOUD DESPAIRINGLY ALAS
THEN SHE DIVED DOWN AGAIN LIKE A SEA GULL AND VANISHED BENEATH THE DARK BLUE WATERS BUT ULYSSES DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO THINK ALAS HE SAID TO HIMSELF IN HIS DISMAY
BUT I CAN FIND NO LANDING PLACE FOR THE COAST IS ROCKY AND SURF BEATEN THE ROCKS ARE SMOOTH AND RISE SHEER FROM THE SEA WITH DEEP WATER CLOSE UNDER THEM SO THAT I CANNOT CLIMB OUT FOR WANT OF FOOT HOLD
AND WILL SEND YOU A FAIR WIND TO TAKE YOU HOME IF THE GODS IN HEAVEN SO WILL IT FOR THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT THESE THINGS AND CAN SETTLE THEM BETTER THAN I CAN ULYSSES SHUDDERED AS HE HEARD HER NOW GODDESS HE ANSWERED
THUS DID HE SPEAK AND THEY ALL HELD THEIR PEACE THROUGHOUT THE COVERED CLOISTER ENTHRALLED BY THE CHARM OF HIS STORY TILL PRESENTLY ALCINOUS BEGAN TO SPEAK ULYSSES SAID HE
THEN AS ONE WHO LIVES ALONE IN THE COUNTRY FAR FROM ANY NEIGHBOR HIDES A BRAND AS FIRE SEED IN THE ASHES TO SAVE HIMSELF FROM HAVING TO GET A LIGHT ELSEWHERE
HE WAVED AN EXPLANATORY PAW EVEN IN THE MOST HIDEOUS OF BEASTS THERE MIGHT BE A DIGNITY HE MEDITATED FOR A MOMENT HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A YAK CORONEL HE ASKED NEVER
HE FOUND THIS GENTLE CREATURE WAITING HIS ARRIVAL AND LEARNED THE MEANS BY WHICH SHE CAME INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
REALLY FRANKLY HE ASKED
THE ONE ENJOINING HIM TO RESPECT HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT THE OTHER CRYING TO HIM TO RESCUE THE PRISONER THESE TWO VOICES CONTINUED UNINTERRUPTEDLY THAT STRUGGLE WHICH TORMENTED HIM TO AGONY UP TO THAT MOMENT
I WAS AFRAID SO HE SAID THAT'S THE CRUEL PART ABOUT IT HAD I BEEN A LION THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CERTAIN PATHETIC SPLENDOUR ABOUT MY POSITION ISOLATED CUT OFF SUFFERING IN REGAL SILENCE
WHY NOT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD CALLED FOR HIM WHAT DEVOTION IT SHOWED IF HE CAME TO HER EVEN NOW IN HIS PRESENT STATE OF BAD HEALTH SHE WAS IN TROUBLE
GOOD BYE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO GAIN BY THAT TO GAIN TIME CRIED THE PRISONER IN A THUNDERING VOICE AND AT THE SAME INSTANT HE SHOOK OFF HIS BONDS THEY WERE CUT
THIS HE REJECTED AT ONCE WHEN YOU HAVE THE HEAD OF A RABBIT THE TAIL OF A LION AND THE MIDDLE OF A WOOLLY LAMB THE NEED FOR ACTION OF SOME KIND IS IMPERATIVE
I WILL NOW FAITHFULLY GIVE YOU IN HIS OWN WORDS AS I HEARD HIM RELATE THEM TO HIS FRIENDS SEVERAL TIMES ON MY ARRIVAL SAYS MY FATHER AT HELVOETSLUYS I WAS OBSERVED TO BREATHE WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
WHAT THAT YOUNG GIRL WHOM THEY WERE ABDUCTING WAS NOT TO BE BROUGHT BACK ONE OF THOSE MONSTERS WAS TO BEAR HER OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WHITHER AND WHAT IF IT WERE SHE IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS SHE
AND WHERE HE KEEPS HIS SHINERS THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE MANAGED MATTERS PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY THAT MEN ARE A DEAL STUPIDER THAN WOMEN
NOT ONLY ABLE BUT REALLY WISHED TO DEVOUR US NOW AS MY ROSINANTE WAS BLIND I HAD THESE HUNGRY GENTLEMEN'S ATTEMPTS TO GUARD AGAINST IN ADDITION TO MY OTHER DIFFICULTIES
SO POPULAR TO ARABY WHERE HE RODE DAILY AMONG HIS FATHER'S SUBJECTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CHEERING HIM HOW AWKWARD FOR EVERYBODY ON TO EURALIA THEN
AND SHE WAS PREPARING TO UNPIN THE LINEN PACKAGE WHICH THE CHAISE SEAT HAD CONVEYED FOR HER IMMEDIATE ACCOMMODATION WHEN HER EYE SUDDENLY FELL ON A LARGE HIGH CHEST STANDING BACK IN A DEEP RECESS ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE THE SIGHT OF IT MADE HER START
BELIEVE THE LAST LETTER TO BE A T AND YET THAT IT SHOULD BE ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT HOUSE WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO RAISE NO COMMON DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT IF NOT ORIGINALLY THEIRS BY WHAT STRANGE EVENTS COULD IT HAVE FALLEN INTO THE TILNEY FAMILY HER FEARFUL CURIOSITY
THE WIND ROARED DOWN THE CHIMNEY THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO SPEAK THE AWFULNESS OF HER SITUATION
STRUCK ON HER AFFRIGHTED EAR HUMAN NATURE COULD SUPPORT NO MORE A COLD SWEAT STOOD ON HER FOREHEAD THE MANUSCRIPT FELL FROM HER HAND AND GROPING HER WAY TO THE BED SHE JUMPED HASTILY IN AND SOUGHT SOME SUSPENSION OF AGONY BY CREEPING FAR UNDERNEATH THE CLOTHES
OBSERVED THE GENERAL TO ELEANOR WOODSTON WILL MAKE BUT A SOMBRE APPEARANCE TODAY IS IT A PRETTY PLACE ASKED CATHERINE WHAT SAY YOU ELEANOR SPEAK YOUR OPINION FOR LADIES CAN BEST TELL THE TASTE OF LADIES IN REGARD TO PLACES AS WELL AS MEN
BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN ILL SIZED ROOM AND FURTHER CONFESSED THAT THOUGH AS CARELESS ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS MOST PEOPLE HE DID LOOK UPON A TOLERABLY LARGE EATING ROOM AS ONE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE HE SUPPOSED HOWEVER
SAID MISS TILNEY THAT I ALWAYS THINK IT THE BEST AND NEAREST WAY
A SMALL DOOR CLOSED ALSO WITH A LOCK AND KEY SECURED IN ALL PROBABILITY A CAVITY OF IMPORTANCE CATHERINE'S HEART BEAT QUICK BUT HER COURAGE DID NOT FAIL HER WITH A CHEEK FLUSHED BY HOPE AND AN EYE STRAINING WITH CURIOSITY
AND FORCED HER IN SPITE OF HER ANXIOUS DESIRE TO PENETRATE THIS MYSTERY TO PROCEED IN HER DRESSING WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY HER PROGRESS WAS NOT QUICK FOR HER THOUGHTS AND HER EYES WERE STILL BENT ON THE OBJECT SO WELL CALCULATED TO INTEREST AND ALARM AND THOUGH SHE DARED NOT WASTE A MOMENT UPON A SECOND ATTEMPT
THE GENERAL PERCEIVED IT AND WITH A CONCERN FOR HER HEALTH WHICH SEEMED TO REPROACH HER FOR HER OPINION OF HIM WAS MOST URGENT FOR RETURNING WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HOUSE HE WOULD FOLLOW THEM IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT I DID NOT I COULD NOT THEN KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED WITH GREAT FIRMNESS
AND FITTED UP IN A STYLE OF LUXURY AND EXPENSE WHICH WAS ALMOST LOST ON THE UNPRACTISED EYE OF CATHERINE WHO SAW LITTLE MORE THAN ITS SPACIOUSNESS AND THE NUMBER OF THEIR ATTENDANTS OF THE FORMER SHE SPOKE ALOUD HER ADMIRATION AND THE GENERAL WITH A VERY GRACIOUS COUNTENANCE
WAS IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE

WHY DON'T PEOPLE JUDGE ME BY MY ACTS NOW LOOK AT ME AS I KNEEL HERE PICKING UP THESE APPLES DO I LOOK LIKE A LOST WOMAN I WISH ALL GOOD WOMEN WERE AS GOOD AS I SHE
I CAN WELL MIND WHEN HE LEFT HOME SAID SAM TIS A GOOD THING FOR THE FELLER SAID HUMPHREY
ONLY AT ODD TIMES BY WAY OF USEFUL PASTIME YET SHE NOW BEHELD HIM AS A FURZE CUTTER AND NOTHING MORE WEARING THE REGULATION DRESS OF THE CRAFT
THOMASIN WAS PERFORCE CONTENT AND YOU WILL KEEP THE SECRET OF MY WOULD BE MARRIAGE FROM CLYM FOR THE PRESENT SHE NEXT ASKED
AS TO GET HOME AGAIN SO SHE WENT ON THE AIR AROUND HER PULSATING SILENTLY AND OPPRESSING THE EARTH WITH LASSITUDE SHE LOOKED AT THE SKY OVERHEAD
HOW DO YOU MEAN I HAVE LONG HAD A SUSPICION THAT YOUR LOVE FOR HIM HAS CHANGED ITS COLOUR
SHE STOPPED A MOMENT DEAR CLYM I WONDER HOW YOUR FACE LOOKS NOW SHE SAID GAZING ABSTRACTEDLY AT THE PIGEON HOLE
IT WAS A FINE AND QUIET AFTERNOON ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK BUT THE WINTER SOLSTICE HAVING STEALTHILY COME ON THE LOWNESS OF THE SUN CAUSED THE HOUR TO SEEM LATER THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS
THUS QUIETLY SHE COULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IN THE MORNING THAT HER COLOURLESS INNER WORLD WOULD BEFORE NIGHT BECOME AS ANIMATED AS WATER UNDER A MICROSCOPE AND THAT WITHOUT THE ARRIVAL OF A SINGLE VISITOR
AS A BLACK SPOT IN THE AIR ABOVE THE CROWN OF THE HILL ON REACHING THIS PLACE MISSUS YEOBRIGHT FELT DISTRESSINGLY AGITATED WEARY AND UNWELL SHE ASCENDED
IT WAS NOW NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK AND THE SUNLIGHT WAS LEAVING THE VALES WHEN THE WEST GREW RED THE TWO RELATIVES CAME AGAIN FROM THE HOUSE AND PLUNGED INTO THE HEATH IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FROM THE FIRST
HAD BEEN PASSED IN THE FRENCH CAPITAL THE CENTRE AND VORTEX
THE LETTER OR ULTIMATE ELEMENT THE SYLLABLE THE CONJUNCTION THE ARTICLE THE NOUN THE VERB THE CASE AND THE SPEECH ONE
WHICH PROTAGORAS HAS CRITICIZED AS BEING A COMMAND WHERE A PRAYER WAS MEANT SINCE TO BID ONE DO OR NOT DO HE TELLS US IS A COMMAND
THAT I WON'T TAKE BUT SHE REPLIED TO HIM WITH GREAT SPRIGHTLINESS AND CANDOUR MY DEAR SIR YOU ARE VERY MUCH MISTAKEN AND YOUR IDEAS ARE VERY OLD FASHIONED IF YOU THINK THAT I HAVE MADE A BAD CHOICE IN SO AND SO
HOWEVER NOT TO MISS ME AND LOSE THYSELF THE BEST PLAN WILL BE TO CUT SOME BRANCHES OF THE BROOM THAT IS SO ABUNDANT ABOUT HERE AND AS THOU GOEST TO LAY THEM AT INTERVALS UNTIL THOU HAST COME OUT UPON THE PLAIN
TO THIS EFFECT MISTRESS NIECE BY THIS FIRST OF ASS COLTS PLEASE PAY TO SANCHO PANZA MY SQUIRE THREE OF THE FIVE I LEFT AT HOME IN YOUR CHARGE SAID THREE ASS COLTS TO BE PAID AND DELIVERED FOR THE SAME
AND ONE DAY SAID TO THE WORTHY WIDOW BY WAY OF BROTHERLY REMONSTRANCE I AM SURPRISED SENORA AND NOT WITHOUT GOOD REASON THAT A WOMAN OF SUCH HIGH STANDING SO FAIR AND SO RICH AS YOU ARE
THAT WILL DO SAID SANCHO NOW LET YOUR WORSHIP SIGN IT THERE IS NO NEED TO SIGN IT SAID DON QUIXOTE BUT MERELY TO PUT MY FLOURISH WHICH IS THE SAME AS A SIGNATURE AND ENOUGH FOR THREE ASSES OR EVEN THREE HUNDRED
WE MAINTAIN THAT TRAGEDY IS PRIMARILY AN IMITATION OF ACTION AND THAT IT IS MAINLY FOR THE SAKE OF THE ACTION THAT IT IMITATES THE PERSONAL AGENTS THIRD COMES THE ELEMENT OF THOUGHT
OR WHAT IS APPROPRIATE TO THE OCCASION
AND NEED NOT BE COUNTED THERE IS NO NOUN HOWEVER ENDING IN A MUTE OR IN EITHER OF THE TWO SHORT VOWELS E AND O ONLY THREE
A LENGTH WHICH ALLOWS OF THE HERO PASSING BY A SERIES OF PROBABLE OR NECESSARY STAGES FROM MISFORTUNE TO HAPPINESS OR FROM HAPPINESS TO MISFORTUNE MAY SUFFICE AS A LIMIT FOR THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STORY
H AND O AND IN A AMONG THE VOWELS THAT MAY BE LONG ARE FEMININES SO THAT THERE IS AN EQUAL NUMBER OF MASCULINE AND FEMININE
AS THE MOST EXALTED PRINCESS ON EARTH IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT ALL THOSE POETS WHO SANG THE PRAISES OF LADIES UNDER THE FANCY NAMES THEY GIVE THEM HAD ANY SUCH MISTRESSES
FOUR SYM THE SON OF JOI NOW JOI THE REBEL HE HAD A SON IN FAR FAR GOSH WHERE THE TALL TREES WAVE SAID JOI
WHERE I'VE HEARD IT REPORTED LARGE PROFITS ARE MADE BESIDES HE CAN SELL US CHEAP BUTTONS AND BRAID SO POOR YOUNG SYM HE WAS SENT TO SCHOOL WHERE THE FIRST THING TAUGHT IS THE GOLDEN RULE DO UNTO OTHERS THE TEACHER SAID
NOBODY MOVED WHO CARES FOR YOU SAID ALICE SHE HAD GROWN TO HER FULL SIZE BY THIS TIME YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A PACK OF CARDS AT THIS THE WHOLE PACK ROSE UP INTO THE AIR AND CAME FLYING DOWN UPON HER SHE GAVE A LITTLE SCREAM
THE GLUGS SHALL KNOW WHAT THE WILD THINGS KNOW SAID HE WHEREVER THE BROAD FIELDS SMILE THEY SHALL WALK WITH CLEAN MINDS FREE OF GUILE THEY SHALL SCOFF ALOUD AT THE CALL OF GREED AND TURN TO THEIR LABOURS AND NEVER HEED
BUT ALL OF THE TALE THAT IS SO FAR TOLD HAS NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO WITH THE OGS OF PODGE AND THEIR CRAFTY DODGE AND THE TRADE IN PICKLES AND GLUE TO TRADE WITH THE GLUGS CAME THE OGS TO GOSH AND THEY SAID IN SEDUCTIVE TONES
BUT THE PRACTICAL AUNT SAID FUDGE YOU FOOL WE'LL PACK UP HIS DINNER AND SEND HIM TO SCHOOL HE SHALL LEARN ABOUT TWO TIMES AND PARSING AND CAPES AND HOW TO MAKE MONEY WITH INCHES ON TAPES WE'LL APPRENTICE HIM THEN TO THE DRAPERY TRADE
THERE THEY ARE SAID THE KING TRIUMPHANTLY POINTING TO THE TARTS ON THE TABLE NOTHING CAN BE CLEARER THAN THAT THEN AGAIN
HE KNOWS THE GLUGS QUITE WELL BY SIGHT YOU CAN NEVER MISTAKE THEM HE WILL SAY FOR THEY ALWAYS ACT IN A GLUGLIKE WAY AND THEY CLIMB THE TREES WHEN THE GLASS POINTS FAIR WITH CIRCUMSPECTION AND PROPER CARE
LIE FLAT ON YOUR BACK ON THE GOOD GREEN EARTH AND ROAR TILL THE GREAT VAULT ECHOES YOUR MIRTH AS HE WALKED IN THE CITY TO SYM THERE CAME SOUNDS ENVENOMED WITH FEAR AND HATE
THERE'S NO NAME SIGNED AT THE END IF YOU DIDN'T SIGN IT SAID THE KING THAT ONLY MAKES THE MATTER WORSE YOU MUST HAVE MEANT SOME MISCHIEF
HE UNFOLDED THE PAPER AS HE SPOKE AND ADDED IT ISN'T A LETTER AFTER ALL IT'S A SET OF VERSES ARE THEY IN THE PRISONER'S HANDWRITING ASKED ANOTHER OF THE JURYMEN NO THEY'RE NOT SAID THE WHITE RABBIT
AND THERE CAME TO THE WONDERING MIND OF HIM LONG THOUGHTS OF THE RIDDLE THAT VEXES YOUTH AND FATHER HE SAID IN THE MART'S LOUD DIN IS THERE AUGHT OF PLEASURE DO SOME FIND JOY BUT HIS FATHER TILTED THE BEARDLESS CHIN
WHENEVER A DEWDROP CLINGS TO A GOSSAMER THREAD AND GLITTERS AND SWINGS DEEP IN HUMILITY BOW YOUR HEAD TO A THING FOR A BLUNDERING RNORTAL'S DREAD AND THERE CAME TO SYM IN HIS LATER YOUTH WITH THE FIRST CLEAR GLANCE IN THE FACE OF GUILE
I WENT NORTHEASTWARD IN A DIRECTION AT RIGHT ANGLES TO MY PREVIOUS EXPEDITION ONCE AS I WENT RUNNING HEADLONG UP THE BEACH I GLANCED OVER MY SHOULDER AND SAW HIS ATTENDANT WITH HIM I RAN FURIOUSLY UP THE SLOPE OVER IT
THEY WERE ALWAYS EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR JERRY WOULD SAY IF YOU IN THE MORNING THROW MINUTES AWAY YOU CAN'T PICK THEM UP IN THE COURSE OF A DAY YOU MAY HURRY AND SCURRY AND FLURRY AND WORRY YOU'VE LOST THEM FOREVER FOREVER AND AYE
SO GLAD WE HIT THE TIME SIR BUT DON'T STAY NOW SIR THE BELL IS RINGING HERE PORTER TAKE THIS GENTLEMAN'S LUGGAGE DOVER LINE TWELVE O'CLOCK TRAIN THAT'S IT AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANOTHER WORD
MY APE LIKE COMPANION TROTTED ALONG BY MY SIDE WITH HIS HANDS HANGING DOWN AND HIS JAW THRUST FORWARD
BUT SNATCHING UP MY NAILED STICK RUSHED HEADLONG FROM MY HIDING PLACE TOWARDS THE SOUND OF THE SEA I REMEMBER A GROWTH OF THORNY PLANTS WITH SPINES THAT STABBED LIKE PEN KNIVES I EMERGED BLEEDING AND WITH TORN CLOTHES UPON THE LIP OF A LONG CREEK OPENING NORTHWARD
AFTER THE BLINDING SUNLIGHT REFLECTED FROM THE SULPHUROUS GROUND
THE LOWER LIMBS LIKE THOSE OF MOST OTHER CONIFERS THAT GROW IN SNOWY REGIONS CURVE DOWNWARD GRADUALLY TAKE A HORIZONTAL POSITION ABOUT HALF WAY UP THE TRUNK THEN ASPIRE MORE AND MORE TOWARD THE SUMMIT
SOME ARE UNDOUBTEDLY MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND YEARS OLD FOR THOUGH ON DEEP MORAINE SOIL THEY GROW ABOUT AS FAST AS SOME OF THE PINES ON BARE PAVEMENTS AND SMOOTHLY GLACIATED OVERSWEPT RIDGES IN THE DOME REGION THEY GROW VERY SLOWLY
HE COULD NOT BEAR ANY CARELESS LOITERING AND WASTE OF TIME AND NOTHING WAS SO NEAR MAKING HIM ANGRY AS TO FIND PEOPLE WHO WERE ALWAYS LATE WANTING A CAB HORSE TO BE DRIVEN HARD TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR IDLENESS
THAT I THINK WOULD MAKE ME FEEL RATHER QUEER IF I WAS ONE OF THEM IF YOU EVER DO GET RICH SAID GOVERNOR GRAY LOOKING OVER HIS SHOULDER ACROSS THE TOP OF HIS CAB YOU'LL DESERVE IT JERRY
AND AS THEY LED HIM INTO A SHOP HE WALKED AS IF HE WERE IN GREAT PAIN JERRY OF COURSE CAME BACK TO THE STAND BUT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES ONE OF THE SHOPMEN CALLED HIM
ONE ON THE STARR KING RIDGE ONLY TWO FEET ELEVEN INCHES IN DIAMETER
HE SET OFF AS HARD AS HE COULD JERRY PATTED ME ON THE NECK NO JACK A SHILLING WOULD NOT PAY FOR THAT SORT OF THING WOULD IT OLD BOY ALTHOUGH JERRY WAS DETERMINEDLY SET AGAINST HARD DRIVING
AND YOU'VE KNOWN ME EVER SINCE REPEATED JIMMY BUT IN A FAR DIFFERENT VOICE JIMMY HAD SUDDENLY COME BACK TO THE PRESENT AND TO HIS GRIEVANCE BUT THEN I AIN'T JAMIE YOU KNOW HE FINISHED WITH SCORNFUL EMPHASIS
I'D BELIEVE ANYTHIN O THE MISTRESS NOW EVEN THAT SHE'D TAKE TER PLAYIN IT HERSELF BUT HAIN'T THE LITTLE GAL TOLD HER EVER SHE'S TOLD EV'RY ONE ELSE I GUESS I'M HEARIN OF IT EV'RYWHERE NOW SINCE SHE WAS HURTED SAID TOM
WHO WILL COME FROM NEW YORK TO MORROW POLLYANNA STILL LOOKED UNCONVINCED BUT AUNT POLLY IF YOU LOVED DOCTOR CHILTON WHAT POLLYANNA AUNT POLLY'S VOICE WAS VERY SHARP NOW
CAUSE HE TOOK MISS JENNIE AWAY FROM EM AN MISS POLLY YOUNG AS SHE WAS COULDN'T NEVER FORGIVE HIM SHE WAS THAT FOND OF MISS JENNIE IN THEM DAYS I SEE I SEE TWAS A BAD MESS HE SIGHED AS HE TURNED AWAY
AN MISS POLLYANNA LOOKIN ON AN BOSSIN FROM THE BED
BRIDLED THE LITTLE GIRL AGGRIEVEDLY AS THE MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH AND ANYWAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SOME FOLKS SHOULD HAVE SUCH A LOT AND OTHER FOLKS SHOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING AND I DON'T LIKE IT
OH NO DEAR IT WASN'T DOCTOR CHILTON AT ALL THAT I MEANT IT IS A NEW DOCTOR A VERY FAMOUS DOCTOR FROM NEW YORK WHO WHO KNOWS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT ABOUT HURTS LIKE YOURS
YES TWAS ALL ROUND ALL ROUND SIGHED NANCY IN HER TURN AS SHE WENT BACK TO HER KITCHEN FOR NO ONE WERE THOSE DAYS OF WAITING EASY THE NURSE TRIED TO LOOK CHEERFUL
GLEN SAINT MARY FOLKS PREFER PLUSH BROCADE AND SIDEBOARDS WITH MIRRORS AND ORNAMENTATIONS I FANCY BUT MISS RUSSELL'S FURNITURE IS VERY GOOD AND I FEEL SURE YOU'LL LIKE IT ANNE SO FAR GOOD SAID ANNE
AND THAT'S WHAT MADE ME THINK THAT IF ONLY A LOT OF MISSUS CAREW'S KIND COULD KNOW THE OTHER KIND BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T DO THE INTRODUCING I DIDN'T KNOW MANY OF THEM MYSELF ANYWAY BUT IF THEY COULD KNOW EACH OTHER
AS HE TURNED LOFTILY AWAY LEAVING A DISTRESSED BEWILDERED POLLYANNA BEHIND HIM WELL ANYWAY I CAN BE GLAD HE DOESN'T ALWAYS ACT LIKE THIS SIGHED THE LITTLE GIRL
I MADE THEM OF THE NICEST RAGS AND BRAIDED THEM IN STRIPES IT WAS SUCH COMPANY THESE LAST FEW WINTERS
COMPREHENDED MANY SUCH NOT UNFREQUENTLY THROUGH EMMA'S PERSUASION HE HAD SOME OF THE CHOSEN AND THE BEST TO DINE WITH HIM BUT EVENING PARTIES WERE WHAT HE PREFERRED AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY
SHE WILL NEVER SUBMIT TO ANY THING REQUIRING INDUSTRY AND PATIENCE AND A SUBJECTION OF THE FANCY TO THE UNDERSTANDING WHERE MISS TAYLOR FAILED TO STIMULATE I MAY SAFELY AFFIRM THAT HARRIET SMITH WILL DO NOTHING
WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER AND SO MANY GOOD NEIGHBOURS AND FRIENDS AND A HOME THAT WANTED FOR NOTHING
AS TO HAVE BEEN ALREADY STAYING THERE MORE THAN ONCE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT LADY RUSSELL WHO THOUGHT IT A FRIENDSHIP QUITE OUT OF PLACE COULD HINT OF CAUTION AND RESERVE LADY RUSSELL INDEED HAD SCARCELY ANY INFLUENCE WITH ELIZABETH
HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE HER LEISURE AND POWERS SHE WAS SO BUSY IN ADMIRING THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES IN TALKING AND LISTENING AND FORMING ALL THESE SCHEMES IN THE IN BETWEENS
TO THE EARLY HOURS AND CIVIL SCRUPLES OF THEIR GUESTS UPON SUCH OCCASIONS POOR MISTER WOODHOUSES FEELINGS WERE IN SAD WARFARE HE LOVED TO HAVE THE CLOTH LAID BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN THE FASHION OF HIS YOUTH
ISABELLA SLOW AND DIFFIDENT AND EVER SINCE SHE WAS TWELVE EMMA HAS BEEN MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AND OF YOU ALL IN HER MOTHER SHE LOST THE ONLY PERSON ABLE TO COPE WITH HER SHE INHERITS HER MOTHER'S TALENTS AND MUST HAVE BEEN UNDER SUBJECTION TO HER
OR A KINDER SISTER OR A TRUER FRIEND NO NO SHE HAS QUALITIES WHICH MAY BE TRUSTED SHE WILL NEVER LEAD ANY ONE REALLY WRONG SHE WILL MAKE NO LASTING BLUNDER WHERE EMMA ERRS ONCE SHE IS IN THE RIGHT A HUNDRED TIMES
THERE IS HARDLY ANY DESIRING TO REFRESH SUCH A MEMORY AS THAT SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY FEELINGLY AND FOR A MOMENT OR TWO HE HAD DONE BUT I HE SOON ADDED WHO HAVE HAD NO SUCH CHARM THROWN OVER MY SENSES
THIS HOWEVER WAS A PROFOUND SECRET NOT TO BE BREATHED BEYOND THEIR OWN CIRCLE SIR WALTER COULD NOT HAVE BORNE THE DEGRADATION OF BEING KNOWN TO DESIGN LETTING HIS HOUSE MISTER SHEPHERD HAD ONCE MENTIONED THE WORD ADVERTISE
SHE MADE EXACT CALCULATIONS AND SHE DID WHAT NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT OF DOING SHE CONSULTED ANNE WHO NEVER SEEMED CONSIDERED BY THE OTHERS AS HAVING ANY INTEREST IN THE QUESTION SHE CONSULTED AND IN A DEGREE WAS INFLUENCED BY HER
BUT SUPPOSING ANY LITTLE INCONVENIENCE MAY BE APPREHENDED FROM THE INTIMACY IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT EMMA ACCOUNTABLE TO NOBODY BUT HER FATHER WHO PERFECTLY APPROVES THE ACQUAINTANCE SHOULD PUT AN END TO IT SO LONG AS IT IS A SOURCE OF PLEASURE TO HERSELF
ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN A WELL KNOWN CHILDREN'S RHYME RUNS BLUE EYE BEAUTY DO YOUR MAMMY'S DUTY BLACK EYE PICK A PIE RUN AROUND AND TELL A LIE GRAY EYE GREEDY GUT EAT ALL THE WORLD UP
IF YOU CANNOT MAKE YOUR THUMB AND ONE FINGER MEET AROUND YOUR WRIST YOU ARE A GLUTTON PROVINCE OF QUEBEC
BUT AS A THEORY EVOLUTION BELONGS TO THE ENLIGHTENMENT OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY LEIBNITZ IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY FIRST UTTERED THE OPINION THAT THE EARTH WAS ONCE IN A FLUID CONDITION
MOLE ON YOUR ARM LIVE ON A FARM ALABAMA
LYING THUS HE ATTEMPTED TO THINK TO LOCATE HIMSELF IN TIME AND SPACE BUT BETWEEN THE PAIN IN HIS HEAD AND THE CONFUSION IN HIS MIND HE FOUND COHERENT THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE
SAID THE SPANIARD PENSIVELY HE SWUNG HIS LEGS FROM THE COUCH AND SAT NOW UPON THE EDGE OF IT HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES
THE REASON ASSIGNED IS THAT IN LAW THERE IS NO FRACTION OF A DAY AND IF THE BIRTH WERE ON THE LAST SECOND OF ONE DAY AND THE ACT ON THE FIRST SECOND OF THE PRECEDING DAY TWENTY ONE YEARS AFTER
IF THE FRONT TEETH ARE WIDE APART IT MEANS ONE CAN'T KEEP A SECRET IF OVERLAPPING ONE IS CLOSE MOUTHED
YOU ARE TO RULE VICE VERSA YOU YIELD
THEN THE SPANIARD BROKE OFF HIS GLANCE GREW STILL MORE TROUBLED
ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT A SINGLE WHITE HAIR MEANS GENIUS IT MUST NOT BE PULLED OUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE IF YOU PULL OUT A WHITE HAIR TWO WILL COME IN ITS PLACE SOMEWHAT GENERAL IN THE UNITED STATES
SO THAT ON EVERY HAND YOU SEE PRUDENCE SUGGESTS TO US THAT WE SHOULD DENY OURSELVES THE PLEASURE OF YOUR COMPANY AND STEELING OUR SOFT HEARTS TO THE INEVITABLE INVITE YOU TO BE SO OBLIGING AS TO STEP OVER THE SIDE I SEE
SMALL EARS SHOW THAT ONE IS TRUTHFUL
A FEW YEARS SINCE IT BECAME KNOWN THAT THIS PUBLISHER WHOM NO ONE WOULD EVER HAVE SUSPECTED OF HOLDING SUCH HETERODOX THEORIES HAD ACTUALLY WRITTEN IT BUT THE TWO GREAT APOSTLES OF THE EVOLUTION THEORY
ONE HUNDRED TWO DIMPLE IN CHIN DEVIL WITHIN CHESTERTOWN MARYLAND ONE HUNDRED THREE A DIMPLE IN THE CHIN IS LUCKY SOME SAY IT SHOWS YOU'RE NO FOOL ONE HUNDRED FOUR
THAT REGARDED HIM OUT OF A TAWNY SARDONIC FACE SET IN A CLUSTER OF BLACK RINGLETS BUT HE WAS TOO BEWILDERED TO MAKE ANY ANSWER THE STRANGER'S FINGERS TOUCHED THE TOP OF DON DIEGO'S HEAD
BUT THERE WAS A SOMETHING IN SIR THOMAS WHEN THEY SAT ROUND THE SAME TABLE WHICH MADE MISTER YATES THINK IT WISER TO LET HIM PURSUE HIS OWN WAY AND FEEL THE FOLLY OF IT WITHOUT OPPOSITION HE HAD KNOWN MANY DISAGREEABLE FATHERS BEFORE
HE COULD NOT HELP GIVING MISSUS NORRIS A HINT OF HIS HAVING HOPED THAT HER ADVICE MIGHT HAVE BEEN INTERPOSED TO PREVENT WHAT HER JUDGMENT MUST CERTAINLY HAVE DISAPPROVED THE YOUNG PEOPLE HAD BEEN VERY INCONSIDERATE IN FORMING THE PLAN
IT SEEMS BUT THE WORK OF A MOMENT AND LAST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US SO HAPPY SO CHEERFUL SO AFFECTIONATE AND NOW AFTER ONLY TEN MINUTES NOTICE GONE TOO WITHOUT INTENDING TO RETURN
AND SO ENDED ALL THE HOPES HIS SELFISH VANITY HAD RAISED IN MARIA AND JULIA BERTRAM JULIA COULD REJOICE THAT HE WAS GONE HIS PRESENCE WAS BEGINNING TO BE ODIOUS TO HER AND IF MARIA GAINED HIM NOT
AND IS NO ALLOWANCE TO BE MADE FOR INADVERTENCE OR FOR SPIRITS DEPRESSED BY RECENT DISAPPOINTMENT
WAS IN HAVING FORMED THE CONNEXION WITH THE RUSHWORTHS THERE SHE WAS IMPREGNABLE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE CREDIT OF BRINGING MISTER RUSHWORTH'S ADMIRATION OF MARIA TO ANY EFFECT IF I HAD NOT BEEN ACTIVE SAID SHE
THOUGH WE HAVE NOT KNOWN HIM LONG HE IS NO STRANGER IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD AND WHO HAS EVER SPOKEN TO HIS DISADVANTAGE HAD HE BEEN IN A SITUATION TO ACT INDEPENDENTLY AND MARRY IMMEDIATELY
THAT EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE EXCEPT ONE IS IN FAVOUR OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT BUT THAT ONE IS THE TOTAL SILENCE OF BOTH ON THE SUBJECT AND WITH ME IT ALMOST OUTWEIGHS EVERY OTHER HOW STRANGE THIS IS
HE HAD TO REINSTATE HIMSELF IN ALL THE WONTED CONCERNS OF HIS MANSFIELD LIFE TO SEE HIS STEWARD AND HIS BAILIFF TO EXAMINE AND COMPUTE AND IN THE INTERVALS OF BUSINESS TO WALK INTO HIS STABLES AND HIS GARDENS AND NEAREST PLANTATIONS
YOU WILL FIND FANNY EVERYTHING YOU COULD WISH SIR THOMAS SAW ALL THE IMPROPRIETY OF SUCH A SCHEME AMONG SUCH A PARTY AND AT SUCH A TIME AS STRONGLY AS HIS SON HAD EVER SUPPOSED HE MUST
HIS DECIDED PREFERENCE OF A QUIET FAMILY PARTY TO THE BUSTLE AND CONFUSION OF ACTING HE SEEMED TO FEEL EXACTLY AS ONE COULD WISH YES INDEED AND THE MORE YOU KNOW OF HIM THE BETTER YOU WILL LIKE HIM HE IS NOT A SHINING CHARACTER
TO LADY BERTRAM AND EDMUND TO DETAIL WHEREBY A MOST CONSIDERABLE SAVING HAD ALWAYS ARISEN AND MORE THAN ONE BAD SERVANT BEEN DETECTED BUT HER CHIEF STRENGTH LAY IN SOTHERTON HER GREATEST SUPPORT AND GLORY
HE LEFT THE HOUSE IN ALL THE SOBERNESS OF ITS GENERAL CHARACTER AND SIR THOMAS HOPED IN SEEING HIM OUT OF IT TO BE RID OF THE WORST OBJECT CONNECTED WITH THE SCHEME AND THE LAST THAT MUST BE INEVITABLY REMINDING HIM OF ITS EXISTENCE
YOU PERFORM YOUR OWN PART IN LIFE AND BURDEN NO ONE TO MORROW SHE CONTINUED I SET OUT FOR THE CONTINENT I SHALL TAKE UP MY ABODE IN A RELIGIOUS HOUSE NEAR LISLE
HOW FULL THE HEDGES ARE OF ROSES BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO GATHER ANY I WANT TO BE AT THE HOUSE I PASSED A TALL BRIAR SHOOTING LEAFY AND FLOWERY BRANCHES ACROSS THE PATH
NOT TO SEND FOR A CARRIAGE AND COME CLATTERING OVER STREET AND ROAD LIKE A COMMON MORTAL BUT TO STEAL INTO THE VICINAGE OF YOUR HOME ALONG WITH TWILIGHT
AND MEANT TO LEAVE HIM CALMLY AN IMPULSE HELD ME FAST A FORCE TURNED ME ROUND I SAID OR SOMETHING IN ME SAID FOR ME
I HAD HEARD FROM MISSUS FAIRFAX IN THE INTERIM OF MY ABSENCE THE PARTY AT THE HALL WAS DISPERSED MISTER ROCHESTER HAD LEFT FOR LONDON THREE WEEKS AGO
HE DID NOT LEAVE THE STILE AND I HARDLY LIKED TO ASK TO GO BY I INQUIRED SOON IF HE HAD NOT BEEN TO LONDON
AND MORE EDEN LIKE IT WAS FULL OF TREES IT BLOOMED WITH FLOWERS A VERY HIGH WALL SHUT IT OUT FROM THE COURT ON ONE SIDE ON THE OTHER A BEECH AVENUE SCREENED IT FROM THE LAWN
WE'LL TALK OVER THE VOYAGE AND THE PARTING QUIETLY HALF AN HOUR OR SO WHILE THE STARS ENTER INTO THEIR SHINING LIFE UP IN HEAVEN YONDER HERE IS THE CHESTNUT TREE
THEY ARE MAKING HAY TOO IN THORNFIELD MEADOWS OR RATHER THE LABOURERS ARE JUST QUITTING THEIR WORK AND RETURNING HOME WITH THEIR RAKES ON THEIR SHOULDERS
IT WOULD BE PAST THE POWER OF MAGIC SIR AND IN THOUGHT I ADDED A LOVING EYE IS ALL THE CHARM NEEDED TO SUCH YOU ARE HANDSOME ENOUGH
AS HE HAD TALKED OF PURCHASING A NEW CARRIAGE SHE SAID THE IDEA OF HIS MARRYING MISS INGRAM STILL SEEMED STRANGE TO HER BUT FROM WHAT EVERYBODY SAID
NOW STOOPING TOWARDS A KNOT OF FLOWERS EITHER TO INHALE THEIR FRAGRANCE OR TO ADMIRE THE DEW BEADS ON THEIR PETALS A GREAT MOTH GOES HUMMING BY ME
YES SIR IN DIFFERENT WAYS I HAVE AN AFFECTION FOR BOTH
ANOTHER EFFORT SET ME AT LIBERTY AND I STOOD
THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME
CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS
BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY
AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM
THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW
IF THE WOOD SMOKED IN THE BEDROOM FIREPLACE MISSUS DAVILOW WHOSE OWN WEAK EYES SUFFERED MUCH FROM THIS INCONVENIENCE SPOKE APOLOGETICALLY OF IT TO GWENDOLEN
THEN THERE ARE MISTER HOLLIS AND LADY FLORA AND THE CUSHATS AND THE GOGOFFS RATHER A RAGGED LOT REMARKED GRANDCOURT AFTER A WHILE WHY DID YOU ASK THE GOGOFFS
WHILE HER FACE BORE PITEOUS TRACES OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT NEW TERRIBLE LIFE LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEED WHICH FULFILLS A CRIMINAL DESIRE I WILL BEAR ANY PENANCE
BE IT SO CRIED ARAMIS CARDINALISTS OR FRONDEURS WHAT MATTERS IT LET US MEET AGAIN AS CAPITAL SECONDS IN A DUEL DEVOTED FRIENDS IN BUSINESS MERRY COMPANIONS IN OUR ANCIENT PLEASURES
AND HE ADDED TURNING TO PORTHOS HERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO'S OF THE SAME OPINION AS MYSELF PORTHOS WHO HAD NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD ANSWERED MERELY BY A WORD AND A GESTURE
HE LOOKED LONG ON THIS YOUNG MAN WHOSE SMILING MOUTH AND HALF CLOSED EYES BESPOKE SOFT DREAMS AND LIGHTEST SLUMBER AS IF HIS GUARDIAN ANGEL WATCHED OVER HIM WITH SOLICITUDE AND AFFECTION
BUT WHAT DOES NOT CHANGE OR CHANGES FOR THE BETTER IS WINE
ARAMIS STARTED BACK AND DREW HIS D'ARTAGNAN BENT FORWARD READY EITHER TO ATTACK OR TO STAND ON HIS DEFENSE
BECAUSE I BENT MY ARM AND RESTED MY HAND ON MY ELBOW SO DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN YES SIR I HAVE FIRED SINCE IN THAT MANNER AND HAVE BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL WHAT A COLD WIND RESUMED ATHOS A WINTRY BLAST
BUT IMAGINATION HAS THE WINGS OF AN ANGEL OF LIGHT AND TRAVELS SAFELY THROUGH OR OVER THE SEAS WHERE WE HAVE BEEN ALMOST SHIPWRECKED THE DARKNESS IN WHICH OUR ILLUSIONS ARE LOST THE PRECIPICE WHENCE OUR HAPPINESS HAS BEEN HURLED AND SWALLOWED UP
AND LET US RETAIN AS OUR BATTLE STANDARD
WE SHOULD BE SO ON THIS OCCASION IF ONLY TO BE FAITHFUL TO OUR OATH SAID ARAMIS AH I'M READY TO DO WHAT YOU WILL CRIED PORTHOS EVEN TO SWEAR BY MAHOMET DEVIL TAKE ME IF I'VE EVER BEEN SO HAPPY AS AT THIS MOMENT
AND OF PIERREFONDS WHICH WAS BETWEEN COMPIEGNE AND VILLARS COTTERETS BUT FORMERLY IT APPEARS BEGAN MOUSQUETON TIMIDLY OH SAID D'ARTAGNAN WE DON'T NOW MAKE WAR AS WE DID FORMERLY TO DAY IT'S A SORT OF DIPLOMATIC ARRANGEMENT ASK PLANCHET
AT THIS MOMENT RAOUL AWOKE WITHOUT A CLOUD ON HIS FACE WITHOUT WEARINESS OR LASSITUDE
D'ARTAGNAN WHO AS A GASCON WAS INCLINED TO SOBRIETY
AND PERHAPS HE COMPREHENDED ALL THAT PASSED IN THE HEART OF THE MAN WHO WAS AWAITING HIS AWAKENING AS A LOVER AWAITS THE AWAKENING OF HIS MISTRESS FOR HIS GLANCE IN RETURN HAD ALL THE TENDERNESS OF LOVE YOU ARE THERE SIR
PERHAPS YOU WILL THINK SIR THAT PROSPERITY HAS SPOILED ME ART THOU HAPPY FRIEND ASKED D'ARTAGNAN AS HAPPY AS POSSIBLE
