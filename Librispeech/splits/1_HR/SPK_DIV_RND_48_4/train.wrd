HE TOOK A TURN OR TWO IN THE ALREADY DARKENING STREET AND TRACED THE THOUGHT IN HIS MIND TO ITS POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES HIS FIRST IMPRESSION WAS CONFIRMED IT IS BEST HE SAID FINALLY RESOLVED
SAYS THE MAN THERE'S THE LAIRD TO BE SURE IF IT'S HIM YOU'RE WANTING WHAT'LL LIKE BE YOUR BUSINESS MANNIE I WAS LED TO THINK THAT I WOULD GET A SITUATION I SAID LOOKING AS MODEST AS I COULD WHAT

RELICS OF THE DAYS WHEN THE COUNTRYMEN OF JULIUS CAESAR HAD SETTLED THERE WHERE HAVE THEY NOT SETTLED I FOR ONE WOULD HARDLY BE ASTONISHED IF RELICS OF THE ANCIENT ROMANS SHOULD SOMEDAY BE FOUND DEEP UNDER THE GRASS GROWING AROUND THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT
BUT AS THEY WERE NOT LEARNED MEN THEY COULD ONLY WALK ABOUT AND STARE ENJOY THE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF NATURAL HISTORY THEY POSSESSED AND WISH WITH ALL THEIR HEARTS THEY HAD ACQUIRED MORE EVEN THE SKELETON OF THE MOUSE PUZZLED JACOB WHAT WONDER
SAID HE NOTHIN LEFT IT'S THESE PEOPLE OF THE INN IT'S THAT BOY I WISH I HAD PUT HIS EYES OUT CRIED THE BLIND MAN PEW

SHOULD HAVE THE TITLE OF UNIVERSAL BELL RINGER EVEN IF IT WERE NOT REALLY A BELL MANY PERSONS NOW WENT TO THE WOOD FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING THE PLACE
FOR THE ROLLING OF THE CARRIAGES AND THE VOICES OF THE MULTITUDE MADE TOO GREAT A NOISE
FOR ONE THING HE NEVER GOT FRIGHTENED AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS NEVER IN TOO GREAT A HURRY YET WHEN THE MOMENT CAME FOR DOING SOMETHING SHARP HE WAS ALWAYS READY FOR IT I MUST ONCE MORE REMIND MY READERS THAT HE HAD BEEN TO THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND
HIS MOTHER HOWEVER WAS A LITTLE SHY OF THE COMPANY FOR HIM AND BESIDES SHE COULD NOT ALWAYS SPARE HIM ALSO HIS FATHER LIKED TO HAVE HIM HIMSELF WHEN HE COULD SO THAT HE WAS MORE DESIRED THAN ENJOYED AMONG THE CABMEN
AT FIRST HE HEARD A GOOD MANY ROUGH AND BAD WORDS BUT HE DID NOT LIKE THEM AND SO THEY DID HIM LITTLE HARM HE DID NOT KNOW IN THE LEAST WHAT THEY MEANT
AS IF IT WOULD SHOWER DOWN ALL ITS BLESSINGS ON THE ROOF WHERE ROSES WERE BLOOMING THE LONG STEMS TWINED ROUND THE GABLE ON WHICH THERE HUNG A SMALL BELL WAS IT THAT WHICH PEOPLE HAD HEARD YES EVERYBODY WAS UNANIMOUS ON THE SUBJECT EXCEPT ONE

WERE MERELY PALE GREY INSTEAD OF PALE BLUE MISTER VAN DER LUYDEN GREETED MISSUS ARCHER WITH COUSINLY AFFABILITY PROFFERED TO NEWLAND LOW VOICED CONGRATULATIONS
COUCHED IN THE SAME LANGUAGE AS HIS WIFE'S AND SEATED HIMSELF IN ONE OF THE BROCADE ARMCHAIRS WITH THE SIMPLICITY OF A REIGNING SOVEREIGN I HAD JUST FINISHED READING THE TIMES HE SAID
SOME TIME THEN SOME TIME THAT YOU ALREADY FORESEE
AND MEDORA IS SIMPLY A GOOD ADVERTISEMENT AS A CONVERT A CONVERT TO WHAT TO ALL SORTS OF NEW AND CRAZY SOCIAL SCHEMES BUT DO YOU KNOW THEY INTEREST ME MORE THAN THE BLIND CONFORMITY TO TRADITION
I PROMISE YOU NOT AS LONG AS YOU HOLD OUT
THAN WHEN THE PORTRAIT HAD BEEN PAINTED SHE ALWAYS INDEED STRUCK NEWLAND ARCHER AS HAVING BEEN RATHER GRUESOMELY PRESERVED IN THE AIRLESS ATMOSPHERE OF A PERFECTLY IRREPROACHABLE EXISTENCE AS BODIES CAUGHT IN GLACIERS
AND SO ENDED ALL THE HOPES HIS SELFISH VANITY HAD RAISED IN MARIA AND JULIA BERTRAM JULIA COULD REJOICE THAT HE WAS GONE HIS PRESENCE WAS BEGINNING TO BE ODIOUS TO HER AND IF MARIA GAINED HIM NOT
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ODD THAT HE SHOULD LEAVE US WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING EVERYTHING TO ME AT ONCE BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE IT IS AN ENGAGEMENT IN SOME RESPECTS NOT PROSPEROUSLY BEGUN FOR THEIR MARRIAGE MUST BE AT A VERY UNCERTAIN DISTANCE
WAS QUITE OVERCOME SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND LEFT THE ROOM THIS VIOLENT OPPRESSION OF SPIRITS CONTINUED THE WHOLE EVENING SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY POWER BECAUSE SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE OF COMMAND OVER HERSELF
DO YOU SUPPOSE HIM REALLY INDIFFERENT TO HER NO I CANNOT THINK THAT HE MUST AND DOES LOVE HER I AM SURE BUT WITH A STRANGE KIND OF TENDERNESS IF HE CAN LEAVE HER WITH SUCH INDIFFERENCE
AS TO GENERAL ATTENTION TO THE INTEREST AND COMFORT OF HIS FAMILY MUCH EXERTION AND MANY SACRIFICES TO GLANCE AT IN THE FORM OF HURRIED WALKS AND SUDDEN REMOVALS FROM HER OWN FIRESIDE AND MANY EXCELLENT HINTS OF DISTRUST AND ECONOMY

IN VERY STIFF NECKCLOTHS ON DUTY AT A LARGE PRIVATE DOOR WITH A HEARSE DRAWN BY FOUR BLACK STEEDS APPROACHING IN THE DISTANCE THE SHOP WAS CLOSE AND HOT
TO LOOK DIGNIFIED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT IS MORE ESPECIALLY SO WHEN SUPERADDED TO THESE PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS ARE A RED NOSE AND YELLOW SMALLS
BUMBLE SHOOK HIS HEAD AS HE REPLIED OBSTINATE PEOPLE MISTER SOWERBERRY VERY OBSTINATE PROUD TOO I'M AFRAID SIR
OLIVER HAD BEEN TOO OFTEN SUBJECTED TO THE PROCESS TO WHICH THE VERY EXPRESSIVE MONOSYLLABLE JUST RECORDED BEARS REFERENCE TO ENTERTAIN THE SMALLEST DOUBT THAT THE OWNER OF THE VOICE WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE
THAT A COLD TREMBLE CAME OVER HIM EVERY TIME HIS EYES WANDERED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DISMAL OBJECT FROM WHICH HE ALMOST EXPECTED TO SEE SOME FRIGHTFUL FORM SLOWLY REAR ITS HEAD TO DRIVE HIM MAD WITH TERROR
FIT FOR THE DEED I HAD TO DO MY HEART WENT HOP MY HEART WENT THUMP I FILLED THE KETTLE AT THE PUMP THEN SOME ONE CAME TO ME AND SAID
I LIKE BIRTHDAY PRESENTS BEST SHE SAID AT LAST
I SEE YOU DON'T SAID ALICE
OH SAID ALICE SHE WAS TOO MUCH PUZZLED TO MAKE ANY OTHER REMARK AH YOU SHOULD SEE EM

ALICE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THIS IT WASN'T AT ALL LIKE CONVERSATION SHE THOUGHT AS HE NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO HER IN FACT HIS LAST REMARK WAS
HOW WELL YOU CAN STRETCH YOUR LEGS OUT IT IS THE MOST GRACEFUL PERFORMANCE I HAVE EVER SEEN
BUT I AM EXTREMELY SORRY FOR THE GARTER I MEAN THE GIRDLE THAT WENT INTO THE WATER TUB I HAVE MUCH ON MY CONSCIENCE I WANT TO BECOME WHITE PAPER
THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS DISCOVERY AND REACHING UP HER CROOK SHE KNOCKED THE ROW OF PRETTY WHITE TAILS OFF THE TREE AND GATHERED THEM UP IN HER FROCK BUT HOW TO FASTEN THEM ONTO HER SHEEP AGAIN WAS THE QUESTION
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO OBLIVION WHILE THE REAL GEMS OF THE COLLECTION WILL DOUBTLESS LIVE AND GROW IN POPULAR FAVOR FOR MANY AGES
IS OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS BOSTON'S THERE LIVED IN A TOWN IN SUSSEX ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN O FOUR AN OLD WOMAN NAMED MARTHA GOOCH SHE WAS A CAPITAL NURSE AND IN GREAT DEMAND TO CARE FOR NEWLY BORN BABIES THEREFORE
GOOD MORNING MOTHER CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU NO DEARIE RETURNED THE WOMAN IN A CRACKED VOICE BUT I WILL SIT BY YOUR SIDE AND REST FOR A TIME THE GIRL MADE ROOM ON THE MOUND BESIDE HER
OH SAID LITTLE BO PEEP IN SURPRISE DO THEY WAG THEIR TAILS I NEVER NOTICED THAT INDEED EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN THEN YOU ARE NOT VERY OBSERVING FOR ONE WHO KNOWS ALL ABOUT SHEEP
ARE DOUBTLESS OFFSHOOTS FROM ANCIENT FOLK LORE SONGS AND HAVE DESCENDED TO US THROUGH MANY CENTURIES THE CONNECTION OF MOTHER GOOSE WITH THE RHYMES WHICH BEAR HER NAME IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE AND IN FACT THREE COUNTRIES CLAIM HER FOR THEIR OWN
ONLY THE CAPTAIN LYING ON A MATTRESS IN THE STERN AND GIVING HIS ORDERS FOR THOUGH GREATLY RECOVERED HE WAS STILL IN WANT OF QUIET WE LAID HER HEAD FOR THE NEAREST PORT IN SPANISH AMERICA FOR WE COULD NOT RISK THE VOYAGE HOME WITHOUT FRESH HANDS
AND NOBODY SCREWED UP HIGH ENOUGH TO OFFER THE FIRST BLOW SILVER NEVER MOVED HE WATCHED THEM VERY UPRIGHT ON HIS CRUTCH AND LOOKED AS COOL AS EVER I SAW HIM HE WAS BRAVE AND NO MISTAKE
WHO WAS STILL TERRIBLY AFRAID OF HIS OLD QUARTERMASTER OR MYSELF WHO HAD REALLY SOMETHING TO THANK HIM FOR ALTHOUGH FOR THAT MATTER I SUPPOSE I HAD REASON TO THINK EVEN WORSE OF HIM THAN ANYBODY ELSE
I BEHELD GREAT HEAPS OF COIN AND QUADRILATERALS BUILT OF BARS OF GOLD THAT WAS FLINT'S TREASURE THAT WE HAD COME SO FAR TO SEEK AND THAT HAD COST ALREADY THE LIVES OF SEVENTEEN MEN FROM THE HISPANIOLA
SPEAK UP TO THE OTHERS AH THE OTHERS RETURNED JOHN THEY'RE A NICE LOT AIN'T THEY YOU SAY THIS CRUISE IS BUNGLED AH BY GUM IF YOU COULD UNDERSTAND HOW BAD IT'S BUNGLED YOU WOULD SEE
GIVEN HIM THE STORES FOR BEN GUNN'S CAVE WAS WELL SUPPLIED WITH GOATS MEAT SALTED BY HIMSELF GIVEN ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING TO GET A CHANCE OF MOVING IN SAFETY FROM THE STOCKADE TO THE TWO POINTED HILL THERE TO BE CLEAR OF MALARIA
AND WHAT A MEAL IT WAS WITH BEN GUNN'S SALTED GOAT AND SOME DELICACIES AND A BOTTLE OF OLD WINE FROM THE HISPANIOLA NEVER I AM SURE WERE PEOPLE GAYER OR HAPPIER
MISS LUCAS PERCEIVED HIM FROM AN UPPER WINDOW AS HE WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND INSTANTLY SET OUT TO MEET HIM ACCIDENTALLY IN THE LANE BUT LITTLE HAD SHE DARED TO HOPE THAT SO MUCH LOVE AND ELOQUENCE AWAITED HER THERE
IN WHICH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME INGENUITY AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD SUCCEED IF MISS DE BOURGH WERE OUT OF THE WAY BUT MY DEAREST JANE YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE
NO ONE WHO HAS EVER SEEN YOU TOGETHER CAN DOUBT HIS AFFECTION MISS BINGLEY I AM SURE CANNOT SHE IS NOT SUCH A SIMPLETON COULD SHE HAVE SEEN HALF AS MUCH LOVE IN MISTER DARCY FOR HERSELF
AND THAT IT AMPLY REPAID HER FOR THE LITTLE SACRIFICE OF HER TIME THIS WAS VERY AMIABLE BUT CHARLOTTE'S KINDNESS EXTENDED FARTHER THAN ELIZABETH HAD ANY CONCEPTION OF
BUT IT IS ALWAYS SO THOSE WHO DO NOT COMPLAIN ARE NEVER PITIED HER DAUGHTERS LISTENED IN SILENCE TO THIS EFFUSION
THAT I HAD BETTER NOT MEET MISTER DARCY THAT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM THE SAME PARTY WITH HIM FOR SO MANY HOURS TOGETHER MIGHT BE MORE THAN I COULD BEAR AND THAT SCENES MIGHT ARISE UNPLEASANT TO MORE THAN MYSELF
I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN TALKING TO UNDUTIFUL CHILDREN
WHEN THAT BUSHY BEARDED PIRATE WAS RUNNING AMUCK IN THE STREETS BUT IF HE HAD IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT HIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HE ASSURES US THAT WHEN ROC WAS NOT DRUNK HE WAS ESTEEMED BUT AT THE SAME TIME FEARED
WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FELT THE EDGE OF THAT CUTLASS DESCENDING RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS PHYSICAL ORGANISM HE WAS A MAN WHO INSISTED UPON BEING OBEYED AND IF ANY ONE OF HIS CREW BEHAVED IMPROPERLY OR WAS EVEN FOUND IDLE
WE WILL PASS TO THE CONSIDERATION OF A REGULAR OUT AND OUT PIRATE ONE FROM WHOSE MAST HEAD WOULD HAVE FLOATED THE BLACK FLAG WITH ITS SKULL AND CROSS BONES IF THAT EMBLEMATIC PIECE OF BUNTING HAD BEEN IN USE BY THE PIRATES OF THE PERIOD
ON THE VOYAGE TO SPAIN ROC WAS ON HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND HE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO BEHAVE VERY WELL WHEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NO DOUBT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY DULL DAYS ON BOARD SHIP
THIS WAS A BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH A CAPABLE PIRATE WAS OBLIGED TO BE PROFICIENT IF HE COULD NOT GET HIMSELF OUT OF SCRAPES HE COULD NOT EXPECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CUTTING DOWN SENTINELS
THE CRUELTY THE DISHONESTY AND THE RECKLESSNESS OF THE SEA ROBBERS OF THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS MEANNESS AND COWARDICE ROC AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SKETCH WAS A TYPICAL PIRATE
THERE HAD BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF RAIN AND NOW THE WIND WAS VERY HIGH AND BLEW THE DRY LEAVES ACROSS THE ROAD IN A SHOWER WE WENT ALONG MERRILY TILL WE CAME TO THE TOLL BAR AND THE LOW WOODEN BRIDGE
I THANK YOU FOR TRYING MY PLAN WITH YOUR GOOD HORSE AND I AM SURE YOU WILL FIND IT FAR BETTER THAN THE WHIP GOOD DAY AND WITH ANOTHER SOFT PAT ON MY NECK SHE STEPPED LIGHTLY ACROSS THE PATH AND I SAW HER NO MORE
LET IT BE EVER SO STEEP OR THE DAY EVER SO HOT UNLESS INDEED WHEN THE DRIVER WAS AFRAID I SHOULD NOT MANAGE IT AND SOMETIMES I WAS SO FEVERED AND WORN
I FOUND THE WORK TELLING VERY MUCH ON MY STRENGTH ONE DAY I WAS LOADED MORE THAN USUAL AND PART OF THE ROAD WAS A STEEP UPHILL I USED ALL MY STRENGTH
A THIRD TIME HE WAS FLOGGING ME CRUELLY WHEN A LADY STEPPED QUICKLY UP TO HIM AND SAID IN A SWEET EARNEST VOICE
AND SO I THOUGHT AS WE WENT ALONG THE SKIRTS OF A WOOD WHERE THE GREAT BRANCHES WERE SWAYING ABOUT LIKE TWIGS AND THE RUSHING SOUND WAS TERRIBLE I WISH WE WERE WELL OUT OF THIS WOOD SAID MY MASTER
AND SHE HASN'T A PENNY LEFT WITH WHICH TO BUY A BITE OF BREAD REALLY OH HOW SORRY I AM MY POOR DEAR LITTLE FAIRY IF I HAD A MILLION I SHOULD RUN TO HER WITH IT BUT I HAVE ONLY FIFTY PENNIES HERE THEY ARE
AND INSTEAD OF MAKING EIGHT BASKETS HE MADE SIXTEEN AFTER THAT HE WENT TO BED AND FELL ASLEEP AS HE SLEPT HE DREAMED OF HIS FAIRY BEAUTIFUL SMILING AND HAPPY WHO KISSED HIM AND SAID TO HIM BRAVO PINOCCHIO
WHO TOOK ME TO THE INN OF THE RED LOBSTER THERE THEY ATE LIKE WOLVES AND I LEFT THE INN ALONE AND I MET THE ASSASSINS IN THE WOOD I RAN AND THEY RAN AFTER ME ALWAYS AFTER ME
AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY AT THAT VERY MOMENT PINOCCHIO AWOKE AND OPENED WIDE HIS EYES WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE AND HIS JOY WHEN ON LOOKING HIMSELF OVER HE SAW THAT HE WAS NO LONGER A MARIONETTE
A LARGE SHIP ALSO SUFFERED THE SAME FATE THE SAILORS WERE ALL SAVED BUT THE SHIP WENT RIGHT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA AND THE SAME TERRIBLE SHARK THAT SWALLOWED ME SWALLOWED MOST OF IT WHAT SWALLOWED A SHIP ASKED PINOCCHIO IN ASTONISHMENT
SHE WILL NEVER COME BACK YESTERDAY SHE WENT AWAY BLEATING SADLY AND IT SEEMED TO ME SHE SAID POOR PINOCCHIO I SHALL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN THE SHARK MUST HAVE EATEN HIM BY THIS TIME
ASKED GEPPETTO TO LOOK FOR A HOUSE OR A HUT WHERE THEY WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO GIVE US A BITE OF BREAD AND A BIT OF STRAW TO SLEEP ON THEY HAD NOT TAKEN A HUNDRED STEPS WHEN THEY SAW TWO ROUGH LOOKING INDIVIDUALS SITTING ON A STONE BEGGING FOR ALMS
AS THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WERE THE VISITORS STOPPED A LONG TIME SPIRITS WERE PRODUCED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ONE OF THE YOUNG LADIES COMPLAINING OF A COLDNESS IN HER INSIDE AND THE CONVERSATION TOOK A VERY CONVIVIAL AND IMPROVING TURN
AND YOUR SENSES WRAPT IN PERFECT UNCONSCIOUSNESS AT SUCH TIME A MORTAL KNOWS JUST ENOUGH OF WHAT HIS MIND IS DOING TO FORM SOME GLIMMERING CONCEPTION OF ITS MIGHTY POWERS
REPLIED THE BEADLE AND THE COCKED HAT AND CANE HAVING BEEN BY THIS TIME ADJUSTED TO THEIR OWNER'S SATISFACTION MISTER BUMBLE AND NOAH CLAYPOLE BETOOK THEMSELVES WITH ALL SPEED TO THE UNDERTAKER'S SHOP
EXCITABLE NATURES MISSUS SOWERBERRY
SOMETIMES HE STOPPED AT THE FIRE PLACE AND SOMETIMES AT THE DOOR MAKING BELIEVE THAT HE WAS STARING WITH ALL HIS MIGHT INTO SHOP WINDOWS AT SUCH TIMES HE WOULD LOOK CONSTANTLY ROUND HIM FOR FEAR OF THIEVES
BUT ALARMED HIM SO MUCH THAT HE RUSHED INTO THE YARD WITHOUT HIS COCKED HAT
THE STARS SEEMED TO THE BOY'S EYES FARTHER FROM THE EARTH THAN HE HAD EVER SEEN THEM BEFORE THERE WAS NO WIND AND THE SOMBRE SHADOWS THROWN BY THE TREES UPON THE GROUND
PERCEIVING FURTHER THAT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THESE RELATIONS I SHOULD SOMETIMES HAVE TO CONSIDER THEM ONE BY ONE AND SOMETIMES ONLY TO BEAR THEM IN MIND OR EMBRACE THEM IN THE AGGREGATE
GOVERNED BY OUR DESIRES AND PRECEPTORS WHOSE DICTATES WERE FREQUENTLY CONFLICTING WHILE NEITHER PERHAPS ALWAYS COUNSELED US FOR THE BEST I FARTHER CONCLUDED THAT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT OUR JUDGMENTS CAN BE SO CORRECT OR SOLID

JUST TO SHOW THE FATES THAT HE DIDN'T CARE A TUPPENCE FOR THEIR VERDICT AS REGISTERED THROUGH THE OBOLUS IT WAS A PECULIAR CUSTOM OF SHAKESPEARE'S TO TOSS UP A COIN TO DECIDE QUESTIONS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE AND THEN DO THE THING THE COIN DECIDED HE SHOULD NOT DO

FLATLY WE'RE GOING TO FIND ELEPHANTS WITH GOLDEN HOWDAHS FROM WHICH PEEP YOUNG MAHARANEES WITH NECKLACES OF RUBIES AND A DAWN SEA COLORED LIKE THE BREAST OF A DOVE
THE LAST THING SHE SAW ON THE STATION PLATFORM WAS KENNICOTT FAITHFULLY WAVING HIS HAND HIS FACE SO FULL OF UNCOMPREHENDING LONELINESS THAT HE COULD NOT SMILE BUT ONLY TWITCH UP HIS LIPS SHE WAVED TO HIM AS LONG AS SHE COULD
FINDING HARD NAMES FOR OUR OPPONENTS HOW WE DO SANCTIFY OUR EFFORTS TO KEEP THEM FROM GETTING THE HOLY DOLLARS WE WANT FOR OURSELVES THE CHURCHES HAVE ALWAYS DONE IT AND THE POLITICAL ORATORS AND I SUPPOSE I DO IT WHEN I CALL MISSUS BOGART A PURITAN

SAID THE OLD LADY VILLEFORT PLACED THE ARM OF MADAME DE SAINT MERAN WITHIN HIS OWN AND CONDUCTED HER TO HIS APARTMENT REST YOURSELF MOTHER HE SAID THE MARCHIONESS RAISED HER HEAD AT THIS WORD
OH YES SIR HE TOLD ME
MAY HAVE HEARD IT AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIMSELF BUT WHY SHOULD HE WISH TO ENLIGHTEN HIMSELF UPON THE SUBJECT ASKED VILLEFORT AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION
AND WENT HIMSELF TO FETCH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER FROM MADAME DE MORCERF'S HE WAS SO PALE WHEN HE APPEARED AT THE DOOR OF THE BALL ROOM THAT VALENTINE RAN TO HIM SAYING OH FATHER SOME MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED
THE NOTARY WHO WAS AT THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY ENTERED GO VALENTINE
AND WILL MEET HIM IF NOT WITH PLEASURE AT LEAST WITH INDIFFERENCE IS IT A SUITABLE MATCH IN EVERY RESPECT AND THE YOUNG MAN IS REGARDED WITH UNIVERSAL ESTEEM
AND THIS MORNING SHE FRIGHTENED ME SO THAT I THOUGHT HER MAD AND MY FATHER WHO YOU KNOW IS A STRONG MINDED MAN HIMSELF APPEARED DEEPLY IMPRESSED WE WILL GO AND SEE SAID THE DOCTOR WHAT YOU TELL ME SEEMS VERY STRANGE
ARE YOU THE OLD MAN WHO CAN MAKE WITHERED TREES FLOWER EVEN OUT OF SEASON THE OLD MAN MADE AN OBEISANCE AND REPLIED I AM THAT OLD MAN THEN THE DAIMIO SAID
SO THAT SHIRO BEGAN TO SCRATCH AND DIG IN ORDER TO FREE HIMSELF FROM THE HORRID OLD MAN'S GRASP
THE STREAM IS NEARLY FORTY FEET WIDE AND WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING RAPIDLY IN THE SPRING IT IS ABOUT FOUR FEET DEEP WITH A CURRENT OF TWO AND A HALF MILES AN HOUR THIS IS ABOUT THE VOLUME OF WATER THAT FORMS THE FALL IN MAY AND JUNE
EVEN THE CROSS OLD NEIGHBOR COULD NOT REFUSE SUCH A SIMPLE REQUEST SO HE CONSENTED TO GIVE THE OLD MAN THE TREE UNDER WHICH SHIRO LAY BURIED SHIRO'S MASTER THEN CUT THE TREE DOWN AND CARRIED IT HOME OUT OF THE TRUNK HE MADE A MORTAR
BUT THE DAIMIO LOOKING AT HIM THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THE OLD MAN HE HAD SEEN BEFORE SO HE ASKED HIM ARE YOU THE MAN WHOM I NAMED HANA SAKA JIJII AND THE ENVIOUS NEIGHBOR ANSWERED WITH A LIE YES MY LORD
FINE THRIFTY FORESTS ARE GROWING LAKES AND MEADOWS AND SMALL SPONGY BOGS MAY BE FOUND HIDING HERE AND THERE IN THE WOODS OR BACK IN THE FOUNTAIN RECESSES OF MOUNT HOFFMAN WHILE A THOUSAND GARDENS ARE PLANTED ALONG THE BANKS OF THE STREAMS
OH HOW COULD YOU OF COURSE A REALLY HONOURABLE YOUNG MAN
TO MITIGATE THE SENTENCE AND AT ELEVEN IN THE EVENING HE WAS TOLD THAT VON BISSING REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING TO SAVE MISS CAVELL'S LIFE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE GOVERNOR DENIED THIS APPEAL EDITH CAVELL WAS ALLOWED TO SEE A BRITISH CHAPLAIN SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST AFRAID OF DEATH
WILL GO DOWN INTO HISTORY WITH THE LUSTRE OF GLORY AND SELF SACRIFICE SURROUNDING IT THAT NAME IS EDITH CAVELL EDITH CAVELL WAS BORN AT SWARDESTON IN NORWICH ENGLAND IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY THREE
THE ILLUMINATIVE FLASH OF TEMPTATION WAS SO SUDDEN SO BRILLIANT THAT THE DOCTOR ONLOOKER CLOSED HIS SOUL'S EYES AND YIELDED WITHOUT EVEN THE LEAST PRETENCE OF RESISTANCE HE TOOK HIS STETHOSCOPE FROM THE TABLE
HAD LOVED HIM THESE TWO YEARS HAD LOVED HIM SINCE THE DAY OF THEIR FIRST MEETING AND THAT WAS JUST AS LONG AS HE HAD LOVED HER BUT HE HAD NEVER TOLD HIS LOVE THERE IS A CODE OF HONOUR RIGHT OR WRONG
AND THAT HE WOULD KEEP THEM INFORMED OF ALL THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE ALL THESE PROMISES WERE BROKEN IT IS TRUE THAT HE SENT A NOTE A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE TRIAL TELLING MISTER WHITLOCK THAT THE CASE WAS ABOUT TO COME TO COURT
CAUSED ME TO BE HIRED OUT WITH A HARD FAMILY WHERE I WAS MUCH ABUSED FREQUENTLY FLOGGED AND STINTED FOR FOOD ET CETERA BUT THE SWEETS OF FREEDOM IN THE CARE OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE NOW DELIGHTED HER MIND
HE HOPPED OFF TO THE WOODS AGAIN HE DID NOT RETURN HOWEVER AND FOR TWO YEARS WAS NOT SEEN AGAIN BUT ONE DARK NIGHT HIS MASTER ON PASSING THROUGH A WOOD HAD HIS ATTENTION ATTRACTED BY THE CRIES OF A CAT
ON THE NINTH DAY HE COULD JUST SING ONE BAR AND ON THE TENTH DAY ONLY ONE NOTE THIS CAT HAD A GREAT DISLIKE FOR MONTHS AFTERWARDS TO MILK IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM
OR SCOTCH CHEESE HE WAS ONCE SENT A DISTANCE OF THIRTY YARDS TRUSSED UP IN THIS FASHION TO A SHOPKEEPER'S PLACE TO BE WEIGHED TUCKER WENT THROUGH THE OPERATION SO PATIENTLY THAT THE GROCER NEVER SUSPECTED
IN THE EATING LINE HAD AN ABUNDANCE OF THE BEST ALSO HAD VERY CHOICE WINES AND BRANDIES WHICH THEY SUPPOSED THAT THEY TRADER AND OYSTER HOUSE KEEPER WOULD GIVE A GREAT DEAL TO HAVE A SMACK AT AND THEN THEY GAVE THEM A VERY CORDIAL INVITATION TO MAKE THEM A VISIT
HE FAINTED FROM LOSS OF BLOOD AND AFTERWARDS HAD HIGH FEVER JUST AS A HUMAN BEING WOULD HAVE DONE UNDER LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES THE GREATER PORTION OF THE SHOT WAS EXTRACTED OR WORKED OUT IN THE PROCESS OF HEALING
AS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS SECRECY AND BY SOME ODD LEAP IN MY THOUGHTS THE POINTED EARS AND LUMINOUS EYES OF MONTGOMERY'S ATTENDANT CAME BACK AGAIN BEFORE ME WITH THE SHARPEST DEFINITION I STARED BEFORE ME OUT AT THE GREEN SEA FROTHING UNDER A FRESHENING BREEZE
AND THE IMPRESSION DID NOT PASS THOUGH I FAILED TO SEE WHAT HAD OCCASIONED IT THEY SEEMED TO ME THEN TO BE BROWN MEN
BUT THE ISLANDERS SEEING THAT I WAS REALLY ADRIFT TOOK PITY ON ME I DRIFTED VERY SLOWLY TO THE EASTWARD APPROACHING THE ISLAND SLANTINGLY AND PRESENTLY I SAW WITH HYSTERICAL RELIEF THE LAUNCH COME ROUND AND RETURN TOWARDS ME
IT WAS A HEAVY WOODEN GATE FRAMED IN IRON AND LOCKED WITH THE CARGO OF THE LAUNCH PILED OUTSIDE IT AND AT THE CORNER WE CAME TO A SMALL DOORWAY I HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED THE WHITE HAIRED MAN PRODUCED A BUNDLE OF KEYS FROM THE POCKET OF HIS GREASY BLUE JACKET
IT WAS THE ANTISEPTIC ODOUR OF THE DISSECTING ROOM I HEARD THE PUMA GROWLING THROUGH THE WALL AND ONE OF THE DOGS YELPED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN STRUCK YET SURELY AND ESPECIALLY TO ANOTHER SCIENTIFIC MAN THERE WAS NOTHING SO HORRIBLE IN VIVISECTION
HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND FORTHWITH THEY WENT OFF WITH THAT HOPPING RUN OF THEIRS FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF THEM I SHOULD THINK UP THE BEACH INCREASE AND MULTIPLY MY FRIENDS SAID MONTGOMERY REPLENISH THE ISLAND HITHERTO WE'VE HAD A CERTAIN LACK OF MEAT HERE
PORTAS ET FORTUNAM EJUS SO SYLLA CHOSE THE NAME OF FELIX AND NOT OF MAGNUS AND IT HATH BEEN NOTED THAT THOSE WHO ASCRIBE OPENLY TOO MUCH TO THEIR OWN WISDOM AND POLICY
OF ADVERSITY IT WAS AN HIGH SPEECH OF SENECA AFTER THE MANNER OF THE STOICS THAT THE GOOD THINGS WHICH BELONG TO PROSPERITY ARE TO BE WISHED BUT THE GOOD THINGS THAT BELONG TO ADVERSITY ARE TO BE ADMIRED
IN PASSION FOR THAT PUTTETH A MAN OUT OF HIS PRECEPTS AND IN A NEW CASE OR EXPERIMENT FOR THERE CUSTOM LEAVETH HIM THEY ARE HAPPY MEN WHOSE NATURES SORT WITH THEIR VOCATIONS OTHERWISE THEY MAY SAY
TILL THEY BE ENGAGED WITH HARD ICE MANY EXAMPLES MAY BE PUT OF THE FORCE OF CUSTOM BOTH UPON MIND AND BODY THEREFORE SINCE CUSTOM IS THE PRINCIPAL MAGISTRATE OF MAN'S LIFE
NEITHER IS THE ANCIENT RULE AMISS TO BEND NATURE AS A WAND TO A CONTRARY EXTREME WHEREBY TO SET IT RIGHT UNDERSTANDING IT WHERE THE CONTRARY EXTREME IS NO VICE
THE WAY OF FORTUNE IS LIKE THE MILKEN WAY IN THE SKY WHICH IS A MEETING OR KNOT OF A NUMBER OF SMALL STARS NOT SEEN ASUNDER BUT GIVING LIGHT TOGETHER
I'LL HAVE NO FAVOURITES ON MY SHIP I ASSURE YOU I WAS QUITE OF THE SQUIRE'S WAY OF THINKING AND HATED THE CAPTAIN DEEPLY

TIRED THOUGH WE ALL WERE TWO WERE SENT OUT FOR FIREWOOD TWO MORE WERE SET TO DIG A GRAVE FOR REDRUTH THE DOCTOR WAS NAMED COOK I WAS PUT SENTRY AT THE DOOR
I KNOW A GENTLEMAN AND YOU MAY LAY TO THAT WE COULD SEE THE MAN WHO CARRIED THE FLAG OF TRUCE ATTEMPTING TO HOLD SILVER BACK NOR WAS THAT WONDERFUL SEEING HOW CAVALIER HAD BEEN THE CAPTAIN'S ANSWER

BEN GUNN'S LAST WORDS CAME BACK TO MY MIND I BEGAN TO SUPPOSE THAT HE HAD PAID THE BUCCANEERS A VISIT WHILE THEY ALL LAY DRUNK TOGETHER ROUND THEIR FIRE AND I RECKONED UP WITH GLEE THAT WE HAD ONLY FOURTEEN ENEMIES TO DEAL WITH
SAYS CAPTAIN SMOLLETT AS COOL AS CAN BE ALL THAT SILVER SAID WAS A RIDDLE TO HIM BUT YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE GUESSED IT FROM HIS TONE AS FOR ME I BEGAN TO HAVE AN INKLING

UNMOVED BY THE DISSUADING COUNSEL OF AN AFFECTIONATE BUT TIMID SISTER AND UNABLE TO PROCURE ASSISTANCE SHE DETERMINED TO BRAVE THE HAZARD AND TO BURY THE BODY WITH HER OWN HANDS SHE WAS DETECTED IN THE ACT AND CREON GAVE ORDERS THAT SHE SHOULD BE BURIED ALIVE
BUT TOWARDS MIDNIGHT WERE ALARMED BY AN EARTHQUAKE WHICH SHOOK THE WHOLE EDIFICE THOR RISING UP CALLED ON HIS COMPANIONS TO SEEK WITH HIM A PLACE OF SAFETY ON THE RIGHT THEY FOUND AN ADJOINING CHAMBER INTO WHICH THE OTHERS ENTERED BUT THOR REMAINED AT THE DOORWAY WITH HIS MALLET IN HIS HAND
THE HEROIC YOUTH LEARNING THE RESPONSE THREW AWAY HIS LIFE IN THE FIRST ENCOUNTER
IN THE FIRST COURSE HUGI SO MUCH OUT STRIPPED HIS COMPETITOR THAT HE TURNED BACK AND MET HIM NOT FAR FROM THE STARTING PLACE
ANTIGONE
THE KING REGARDING THEM WITH A SCORNFUL SMILE SAID IF I DO NOT MISTAKE ME THAT STRIPLING YONDER MUST BE THE GOD THOR THEN ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO THOR HE SAID PERHAPS THOU MAYST BE MORE THAN THOU APPEAREST TO BE
AND BY MY TROTH HAD I KNOWN BEFOREHAND THAT THOU HADST SO MUCH STRENGTH IN THEE
RESOLVED THAT IF HE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF STRIKING A THIRD BLOW IT SHOULD SETTLE ALL MATTERS BETWEEN THEM
IN HER LITERARY PURSUITS NOW SHE WOULD BE JUBILANT OVER A BRILLIANT IDEA NOW DESPAIRING BECAUSE SOME CONTRARY CHARACTER WOULD NOT BEHAVE PROPERLY DIANA COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MAKE THEM DO AS YOU WANT THEM TO SHE SAID
NO IT'S IN YOUR SOUL ANSWERED ANNE THANKFUL FOR THE DARKNESS SINCE GRAVITY MUST BE PRESERVED IN SERIOUS MATTERS I S'POSE I CAN'T GET CLEAR OF IT THEN SAID DAVY WITH A SIGH
CHANGING THE NAME OF COURSE OR ELSE MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WOULD PROBABLY THINK SHE WAS THE HEROINE
YOU USED TO WRITE PERFECTLY THRILLING STORIES YEARS AGO IN OUR OLD STORY CLUB
YOU LOOK PALE YOU'D BETTER KEEP OUT OF THE SUN THIS AFTERNOON ADMONISHED MISSUS LYNDE DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY LIES YOU TOLD MISSUS LYNDE ASKED DORA REPROACHFULLY AS SOON AS THEY WERE ALONE AFTER DINNER DAVY
THE VERY IDEA OF YOUR BEING SCARED OF THOSE COWS SCOFFED DAVY WHY THEY'RE BOTH YOUNGER THAN YOU THEY'RE BIGGER SAID DORA THEY WON'T HURT YOU COME ALONG NOW THIS IS GREAT
THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THAT REPORT SAID DIANA BLUSHING WELL DON'T PUT IT OFF TOO LONG SAID AUNT ATOSSA SIGNIFICANTLY YOU'LL FADE SOON YOU'RE ALL COMPLEXION AND HAIR AND THE WRIGHTS ARE TERRIBLE FICKLE
YOU CAN'T DO SO IF YOUR ATTENTION IS DISTRACTED BY IRRELEVANT GOSSIP HIS OWN CONVERSATION
BUT FOR MYSELF I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU
TOO INDIFFERENT TO SORDID CONSIDERATIONS
THOUGH WITH A HEAVY SPIRIT FOR HE SAID
FRESH COMPLEXIONS AND SOMETHING OF THE SMILE OF CHILDHOOD YES THEIR EYES WHICH ISABEL ADMIRED WERE ROUND QUIET AND CONTENTED
AH BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S VISIT TO MAKE ONE FEEL GRAND OH EXCLAIMED LUDLOW SHE'S GRANDER THAN EVER WHENEVER I FEEL GRAND SAID THE GIRL IT WILL BE FOR A BETTER REASON
SHE WAS REASSURED QUICKLY ENOUGH BY HER SENSE OF HIS GREAT GOOD MANNERS
FROM HIS FAMILY DISAGREEMENTS AS HE WOULD HAVE IT THAT IT DID REALLY YOU KNOW SIR IT WAS IN HIS SINKING FRAME WE MIGHT HAVE GOT ON TOLERABLY NOTWITHSTANDING BUT
BUT IT WAS NOT WITH A DESIRE FOR DOZING FORGETFULNESS
A COUNTRY SO LITTLE OPULENT AS OURS MUST FEEL THIS NECESSITY IN A MUCH STRONGER DEGREE BUT WHO WOULD LEND TO A GOVERNMENT THAT PREFACED ITS OVERTURES FOR BORROWING
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNION HAS GRADUALLY DWINDLED INTO A STATE OF DECAY APPROACHING NEARLY TO ANNIHILATION WHO CAN DOUBT THAT THE HAPPINESS OF THE PEOPLE IN BOTH COUNTRIES WOULD BE PROMOTED BY COMPETENT AUTHORITIES IN THE PROPER HANDS
THAT MANKIND WITHOUT DIFFICULTY ADOPT NOT ONLY THE MORE SIMPLE THEOREMS OF THE SCIENCE BUT EVEN THOSE ABSTRUSE PARADOXES WHICH HOWEVER THEY MAY APPEAR SUSCEPTIBLE OF DEMONSTRATION
LET US ATTEND TO WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECTS OF THIS SITUATION IN THE VERY FIRST WAR IN WHICH WE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE ENGAGED WE WILL PRESUME FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE THAT THE REVENUE ARISING FROM THE IMPOST DUTIES ANSWERS THE PURPOSES OF A PROVISION FOR THE PUBLIC DEBT
THE HALCYON SCENES OF THE POETIC OR FABULOUS AGE BUT TO THOSE WHO BELIEVE WE ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE A COMMON PORTION OF THE VICISSITUDES AND CALAMITIES WHICH HAVE FALLEN TO THE LOT OF OTHER NATIONS THEY MUST APPEAR ENTITLED TO SERIOUS ATTENTION
WOULD REQUIRE A DEGREE OF CREDULITY NOT OFTEN TO BE MET WITH IN THE PECUNIARY TRANSACTIONS OF MANKIND AND LITTLE RECONCILABLE WITH THE USUAL SHARP SIGHTEDNESS OF AVARICE REFLECTIONS OF THIS KIND MAY HAVE TRIFLING WEIGHT WITH MEN WHO HOPE TO SEE REALIZED IN AMERICA
KNIGHTS AND SQUIRES THE BONES OF KING EDWARD THE MARTYR CAREFULLY REMOVED HITHER FOR HOLY PRESERVATION BROUGHT SHASTON A RENOWN WHICH MADE IT THE RESORT OF PILGRIMS FROM EVERY PART OF EUROPE
THINK NO MORE THAN YOU CAN HELP OF SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY THE DISAPPOINTMENT WAS KEEN HE KNEW HER MOOD THE LOOK OF HER FACE WHEN SHE SUBSCRIBED HERSELF AT LENGTH THUS
WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ENORMOUS ABBEY THE WHOLE PLACE COLLAPSED IN A GENERAL RUIN THE MARTYR'S BONES MET WITH THE FATE OF THE SACRED PILE THAT HELD THEM AND NOT A STONE IS NOW LEFT TO TELL WHERE THEY LIE
AND DREW TOWARDS THE SCHOOL HOUSE THE HOUR WAS TOO EARLY THE PUPILS WERE STILL IN SCHOOL HUMMING SMALL LIKE A SWARM OF GNATS
ARE PASSED OVER IN THIS AND ONE OF THE QUEEREST AND QUAINTEST SPOTS IN ENGLAND STANDS VIRTUALLY UNVISITED TO DAY IT HAS A UNIQUE POSITION ON THE SUMMIT OF A STEEP AND IMPOSING SCARP RISING ON THE NORTH SOUTH AND WEST SIDES OF THE BOROUGH
AS WAS THE LITTLE CREATURE'S HABIT IT DID NOT SOON REPEAT ITS CRY AND PROBABLY WOULD NOT DO SO MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE BUT WOULD REMAIN BEARING ITS TORTURE TILL THE MORROW WHEN THE TRAPPER WOULD COME AND KNOCK IT ON THE HEAD
LET ME HELP YOU EVEN IF I DO LOVE YOU AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T SAY IT I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BUT I CAN'T ADMIT SO MUCH AS THAT THERE GUESS WHAT YOU LIKE BUT DON'T PRESS ME TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
AND WOULD WANDER ABOUT THE ROOM AT NIGHT OR SIT IN AN ARM CHAIR THINKING THIS HAD BECOME A HABIT WITH HIM HE OFTEN SLEPT QUITE ALONE IN THE HOUSE SENDING HIS SERVANTS TO THE LODGE BUT USUALLY SMERDYAKOV REMAINED SLEEPING ON A BENCH IN THE HALL
THIS YOUNG MAN WAS PREPARING TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY MIUESOV WITH WHOM HE WAS STAYING FOR THE TIME WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HIM TO GO ABROAD TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH OR JENA THE YOUNG MAN WAS STILL UNDECIDED HE WAS THOUGHTFUL AND ABSENT MINDED
THOUGH OF LATE HE HAS BEEN SO WEAK THAT HE HAS HARDLY SHOWN HIMSELF EVEN TO THE PEOPLE SO THEN THERE ARE LOOPHOLES AFTER ALL TO CREEP OUT OF THE HERMITAGE TO THE LADIES DON'T SUPPOSE HOLY FATHER THAT I MEAN ANY HARM
WHAT'S THAT FOR ASKED GRIGORY LOOKING AT HIM THREATENINGLY FROM UNDER HIS SPECTACLES OH NOTHING GOD CREATED LIGHT ON THE FIRST DAY AND THE SUN MOON AND STARS ON THE FOURTH DAY
HE READ A LITTLE BUT DIDN'T LIKE IT HE DID NOT ONCE SMILE AND ENDED BY FROWNING WHY ISN'T IT FUNNY ASKED FYODOR PAVLOVITCH SMERDYAKOV DID NOT SPEAK ANSWER STUPID
STANDS A PEASANT IN A TORN KAFTAN AND BARK SHOES HE STANDS AS IT WERE LOST IN THOUGHT YET HE IS NOT THINKING HE IS CONTEMPLATING IF ANY ONE TOUCHED HIM HE WOULD START AND LOOK AT ONE AS THOUGH AWAKENING AND BEWILDERED
