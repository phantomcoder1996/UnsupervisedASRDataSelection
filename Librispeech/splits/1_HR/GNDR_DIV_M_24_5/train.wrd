HE FEARED THAT THE EMOTION OF HIS VOICE WOULD BETRAY HIM THE JAILER WENT AWAY SHAKING HIS HEAD NIGHT CAME DANTES HOPED THAT HIS NEIGHBOR WOULD PROFIT BY THE SILENCE TO ADDRESS HIM BUT HE WAS MISTAKEN THE NEXT MORNING HOWEVER
SOME HOURS AFTERWARDS IT BEGAN AGAIN NEARER AND MORE DISTINCT EDMOND WAS INTENSELY INTERESTED SUDDENLY THE JAILER ENTERED
WHO ARE HUNG UP TO THE YARD ARM HE WOULD NOT DIE BY WHAT SEEMED AN INFAMOUS DEATH HE RESOLVED TO ADOPT THE SECOND AND BEGAN THAT DAY TO CARRY OUT HIS RESOLVE NEARLY FOUR YEARS HAD PASSED AWAY
OR WHETHER THE NOISE WAS REALLY LOUDER THAN USUAL EDMOND RAISED HIS HEAD AND LISTENED IT WAS A CONTINUAL SCRATCHING AS IF MADE BY A HUGE CLAW A POWERFUL TOOTH OR SOME IRON INSTRUMENT ATTACKING THE STONES
HE WAS WRONG TO LEAVE IT THERE BUT THE JAILER WAS WRONG NOT TO HAVE LOOKED BEFORE HIM THE JAILER THEREFORE ONLY GRUMBLED THEN HE LOOKED ABOUT FOR SOMETHING TO POUR THE SOUP INTO DANTES ENTIRE DINNER SERVICE CONSISTED OF ONE PLATE THERE WAS NO ALTERNATIVE
AND HE THEN TURNED TO GOD ALL THE PIOUS IDEAS THAT HAD BEEN SO LONG FORGOTTEN RETURNED HE RECOLLECTED THE PRAYERS HIS MOTHER HAD TAUGHT HIM
RESTORING VIGOR AND AGILITY TO HIS LIMBS BY EXERCISE AND SO PREPARING HIMSELF FOR HIS FUTURE DESTINY AT INTERVALS HE LISTENED TO LEARN IF THE NOISE HAD NOT BEGUN AGAIN AND GREW IMPATIENT AT THE PRUDENCE OF THE PRISONER
AT FIRST GAYLY THEN WITH DELIBERATION AND AT LAST WITH REGRET NOTHING BUT THE RECOLLECTION OF HIS OATH GAVE HIM STRENGTH TO PROCEED
ALL I DO KNOW IS THAT I WAS JUST NINETEEN WHEN I WAS ARRESTED THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN NOT QUITE TWENTY SIX MURMURED THE VOICE AT THAT AGE HE CANNOT BE A TRAITOR
HIS PROSPECTS LESS DESPERATE HE WAS STILL YOUNG HE WAS ONLY FOUR OR FIVE AND TWENTY HE HAD NEARLY FIFTY YEARS TO LIVE WHAT UNFORSEEN EVENTS MIGHT NOT OPEN HIS PRISON DOOR AND RESTORE HIM TO LIBERTY
YET IN SPITE OF HIS EARNEST PRAYERS DANTES REMAINED A PRISONER THEN GLOOM SETTLED HEAVILY UPON HIM
AND LOOKING FORWARD WITH TERROR TO HIS FUTURE EXISTENCE CHOSE THAT MIDDLE LINE THAT SEEMED TO AFFORD HIM A REFUGE SOMETIMES SAID HE IN MY VOYAGES WHEN I WAS A MAN AND COMMANDED OTHER MEN
IF ON THE CONTRARY IT IS A PRISONER THE NOISE I MAKE WILL ALARM HIM HE WILL CEASE AND NOT BEGIN AGAIN UNTIL HE THINKS EVERY ONE IS ASLEEP EDMOND ROSE AGAIN BUT THIS TIME HIS LEGS DID NOT TREMBLE AND HIS SIGHT WAS CLEAR
FROM PRESUMING TO SULLY THE ARISTOCRATIC ENCLOSURE BELONGING TO THE MANSION THE GATE HAD BEEN BOARDED UP TO A HEIGHT OF SIX FEET TRUE THE PLANKS WERE NOT SO CLOSELY ADJUSTED BUT THAT A HASTY PEEP MIGHT BE OBTAINED THROUGH THEIR INTERSTICES
THE HOUSE WAS OF WHITE STONE AND IN A SMALL COURT BEFORE IT WERE TWO SMALL BEDS FULL OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS
ALAS NO MAXIMILIAN THIS MUST NOT BE FOR MANY REASONS WE SHOULD PRESUME TOO MUCH ON OUR OWN STRENGTH AND LIKE OTHERS PERHAPS BE LED ASTRAY BY OUR BLIND CONFIDENCE IN EACH OTHER'S PRUDENCE
HE MEANS THAT THE ARTICLES CONTAINED IN THIS PURSE ARE THE RELICS OF THE ANGEL I SPOKE OF JUST NOW THIS I DO NOT COMPREHEND AND YET I MAY NOT ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION MADAME REPLIED MONTE CRISTO BOWING
THE COUNT'S FEATURES DISPLAYED AN EXPRESSION OF THE MOST INTENSE CURIOSITY OH ALL THIS IS A FAMILY HISTORY AS CHATEAU RENAUD TOLD YOU THE OTHER DAY OBSERVED MAXIMILIAN
MONSIEUR RETURNED MAXIMILIAN RAISING THE GLASS COVER AND RESPECTFULLY KISSING THE SILKEN PURSE THIS HAS TOUCHED THE HAND OF A MAN WHO SAVED MY FATHER FROM SUICIDE US FROM RUIN AND OUR NAME FROM SHAME AND DISGRACE A MAN BY WHOSE MATCHLESS BENEVOLENCE WE POOR CHILDREN
BUT I WISHED TO HAVE YOUR ADVICE IS MY COUNSEL
FOR THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR MANY YEARS THAT I HAVE THUS YIELDED TO MY FEELINGS AND HE HASTILY QUITTED THE APARTMENT THIS COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO IS A STRANGE MAN SAID EMMANUEL YES ANSWERED MAXIMILIAN BUT I FEEL SURE HE HAS AN EXCELLENT HEART AND THAT HE LIKES US
LEFT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS WHICH WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN MY SISTER AND MYSELF FOR WE WERE HIS ONLY CHILDREN HER HUSBAND WHO WHEN HE MARRIED HER HAD NO OTHER PATRIMONY THAN HIS NOBLE PROBITY HIS FIRST RATE ABILITY AND HIS SPOTLESS REPUTATION WISHED TO POSSESS AS MUCH AS HIS WIFE
IF LORD WILMORE WAS YOUR UNKNOWN BENEFACTOR I FEAR YOU WILL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN I PARTED FROM HIM TWO YEARS AGO AT PALERMO AND HE WAS THEN ON THE POINT OF SETTING OUT FOR THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS SO THAT I FEAR HE WILL NEVER RETURN
BUT CONTINUED SHE LORD WILMORE HAD A FAMILY OR FRIENDS HE MUST HAVE KNOWN SOME ONE CAN WE NOT OH IT IS USELESS TO INQUIRE RETURNED THE COUNT PERHAPS AFTER ALL HE WAS NOT THE MAN YOU SEEK FOR
WHICH WAS FAINTLY DISCERNIBLE THROUGH THE DENSE MASS OF VERDURE THAT PARTIALLY CONCEALED IT THOUGH SITUATED BUT A HUNDRED PACES OFF WHOEVER HAD SELECTED THIS RETIRED PORTION OF THE GROUNDS AS THE BOUNDARY OF A WALK OR AS A PLACE FOR MEDITATION
INTO THE LARGE STONE VASES THAT STOOD UPON THE TWO SQUARE PILASTERS OF A CURIOUSLY WROUGHT IRON GATE
BECAUSE OF THE CONTRADICTION WHICH CONSENTS NOT O MISERABLE ME HOW I DID SHUDDER WHEN HE SEIZED ON ME SAYING PERADVENTURE THOU DIDST NOT THINK THAT I WAS A LOGICIAN HE BORE ME UNTO MINOS
AND THREATENING WITH HIS FINGER FIERCELY AND HEARD HIM CALLED GERI DEL BELLO SO WHOLLY AT THAT TIME WAST THOU IMPEDED BY HIM WHO FORMERLY HELD ALTAFORTE THOU DIDST NOT LOOK THAT WAY
AND THOU SHALT SEE I AM CAPOCCHIO'S SHADE WHO METALS FALSIFIED BY ALCHEMY THOU MUST REMEMBER IF I WELL DESCRY THEE
BEGAN TO WAVE ITSELF ABOUT EVEN AS A FLAME DOTH WHICH THE WIND FATIGUES THEREAFTERWARD THE SUMMIT TO AND FRO MOVING AS IF IT WERE THE TONGUE THAT SPAKE IT UTTERED FORTH A VOICE AND SAID
TO PUT THE MORE MY SIGHS IN FLIGHT THERE IS ROMENA WHERE I COUNTERFEITED THE CURRENCY IMPRINTED WITH THE BAPTIST FOR WHICH I LEFT MY BODY BURNED ABOVE
THEN URGED ME ON HIS WEIGHTY ARGUMENTS THERE WHERE MY SILENCE WAS THE WORST ADVICE AND SAID I FATHER SINCE THOU WASHEST ME OF THAT SIN INTO WHICH I NOW MUST FALL
STILL BE YE UNWILLING TO DENY THE KNOWLEDGE FOLLOWING THE SUN OF THE UNPEOPLED WORLD CONSIDER YE THE SEED FROM WHICH YE SPRANG YE WERE NOT MADE TO LIVE LIKE UNTO BRUTES
BOTH OF THE SHORES I SAW AS FAR AS SPAIN FAR AS MOROCCO AND THE ISLE OF SARDES AND THE OTHERS WHICH THAT SEA BATHES ROUND ABOUT I AND MY COMPANY WERE OLD AND SLOW
WHEN IT WAS COME CLOSE TO THE BRIDGE'S FOOT IT LIFTED HIGH ITS ARM WITH ALL THE HEAD TO BRING MORE CLOSELY UNTO US ITS WORDS WHICH WERE BEHOLD NOW THE SORE PENALTY
THE OTHER UPWARD TURNS O YE WHO WITHOUT ANY TORMENT ARE AND WHY I KNOW NOT IN THE WORLD OF WOE HE SAID TO US BEHOLD AND BE ATTENTIVE UNTO THE MISERY OF MASTER ADAM
AND TO LICK UP THE MIRROR OF NARCISSUS THOU WOULDST NOT WANT WORDS MANY TO INVITE THEE
AND THOU INSTRUCT ME HOW TO RAZE PALESTRINA TO THE GROUND HEAVEN HAVE I POWER TO LOCK AND TO UNLOCK AS THOU DOST KNOW THEREFORE THE KEYS ARE TWO THE WHICH MY PREDECESSOR HELD NOT DEAR
STILL IT APPEARED WITH AGONY TRANSFIXED THUS BY NOT HAVING ANY WAY OR ISSUE AT FIRST FROM OUT THE FIRE TO ITS OWN LANGUAGE CONVERTED WERE THE MELANCHOLY WORDS BUT AFTERWARDS
AND THEY OBEYED AND FROM THAT TIME HE GREW RICHER THAN EVER AND THE YOUTH RETURNED TO HIS MOTHER AND TOLD HER ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND THEY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF THE ADVICE WHICH CHANDO HAD GIVEN TO THE TWO MEN AND ACTED ACCORDINGLY
HOW IS IT THAT IT HAS ESCAPED FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE TOMB AND THE RECESSES OF OUR HEARTS WHERE IT WAS BURIED TO VISIT US NOW LIKE A PHANTOM WHITENING OUR CHEEKS AND FLUSHING OUR BROWS WITH SHAME ALAS SAID HERMINE
THAN ANY OTHER WOMAN CALLING UPON HER LAWYER
NO NOISE DISTURBED THE SILENCE BUT THE OWL WHOSE PIERCING CRY SEEMED TO BE CALLING UP THE PHANTOMS OF THE NIGHT I TIED MY LANTERN TO A FORKED BRANCH I HAD NOTICED A YEAR BEFORE
AND WHY HE SPEAKS IN OUR PRESENCE OF CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN DISINTERRED IN A GARDEN VILLEFORT PRONOUNCED THESE WORDS WITH AN ACCENT WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE THE COUNT SHUDDER HAD HE HEARD HIM THEN HE PRESSED THE HAND THE BARONESS RELUCTANTLY GAVE HIM AND LED HER RESPECTFULLY BACK TO THE DOOR
YOU CAN FEEL FOR MY EMOTION CAN YOU NOT SPARE ME THEN I BESEECH YOU WHEN I LOOK AT THIS ROOM WHENCE SO MANY GUILTY CREATURES HAVE DEPARTED TREMBLING AND ASHAMED WHEN I LOOK AT THAT CHAIR BEFORE WHICH I NOW SIT TREMBLING AND ASHAMED
FIXING HIS EYES MORE STEADFASTLY ON HER THAN HE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE DID YOU EVER REVEAL TO ANY ONE OUR CONNECTION NEVER TO ANY ONE YOU UNDERSTAND ME REPLIED VILLEFORT AFFECTIONATELY WHEN I SAY ANY ONE PARDON MY URGENCY
IT IS TRUE THAT EVERY STEP IN OUR LIVES IS LIKE THE COURSE OF AN INSECT ON THE SANDS IT LEAVES ITS TRACK ALAS TO MANY THE PATH IS TRACED BY TEARS SIR SAID MADAME DANGLARS
THINK NOT I CONTENTED MYSELF WITH THIS ONE EFFORT CONTINUED VILLEFORT NO I SEARCHED THE WHOLE THICKET I THOUGHT THE ASSASSIN HAVING DISCOVERED THE CHEST AND SUPPOSING IT TO BE A TREASURE HAD INTENDED CARRYING IT OFF BUT PERCEIVING HIS ERROR
AS THOUGH SHE WOULD SPRING FROM HER CHAIR BUT VILLEFORT STOPPED AND CLASPED HIS HANDS AS IF TO IMPLORE HER ATTENTION WE THOUGHT IT DEAD HE REPEATED I PLACED IT IN THE CHEST WHICH WAS TO TAKE THE PLACE OF A COFFIN I DESCENDED TO THE GARDEN I DUG A HOLE
AND DIRECTED THE DRIVER TO GO TO THE RUE DE HARLAY AS SOON AS SHE WAS SEATED IN THE VEHICLE SHE DREW FROM HER POCKET A VERY THICK BLACK VEIL WHICH SHE TIED ON TO HER STRAW BONNET SHE THEN REPLACED THE BONNET AND SAW WITH PLEASURE IN A LITTLE POCKET MIRROR

HIS MOTHER HOWEVER WAS A LITTLE SHY OF THE COMPANY FOR HIM AND BESIDES SHE COULD NOT ALWAYS SPARE HIM ALSO HIS FATHER LIKED TO HAVE HIM HIMSELF WHEN HE COULD SO THAT HE WAS MORE DESIRED THAN ENJOYED AMONG THE CABMEN
THIS HE HAD DONE AND WAS NOW GOING ON IN WOODEN SHOES AND IN HIS HUMBLE DRESS FOR THE BELL SOUNDED WITH SO DEEP A TONE AND WITH SUCH STRANGE POWER THAT PROCEED HE MUST
I DON'T KNOW BUT JACINTO IS YELLING SOMETHING ABOUT VAMPIRES VAMPIRES
SAID HIS MOTHER SHE HAD RINGS ON HER FINGERS ANYHOW RETURNED DIAMOND OF COURSE SHE HAD AS ANY LADY WOULD WHAT HAS THAT TO DO WITH IT WHEN WE WERE DOWN AT SANDWICH SAID DIAMOND YOU SAID YOU WOULD HAVE TO PART WITH YOUR MOTHER'S RING NOW WE WERE POOR
SHE TOLD THE CABMAN AND AWAY THEY DROVE WHEN THEY REACHED THE HOUSE DIAMOND'S FATHER GOT DOWN AND RANG THE BELL
SHOULD HAVE THE TITLE OF UNIVERSAL BELL RINGER EVEN IF IT WERE NOT REALLY A BELL MANY PERSONS NOW WENT TO THE WOOD FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING THE PLACE
HE RECALLED ANOTHER THING THAT HAD HAPPENED THAT MORNING WHICH ALTHOUGH IT SEEMED A MERE ACCIDENT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAD HAPPENED SINCE
AFTER THAT WELL WE SHALL TRUST TO LUCK FOR WHAT WE SHALL FIND THERE ARE SAID TO BE MANY CURIOUS THINGS WENT ON JACINTO SPEAKING AS THOUGH HE HAD NO INTEREST

WOODROOF AND ANEMONIES GREW ALMOST TOO HIGH BLOOMING CONVOLVULUSES AND BLACKBERRY BUSHES HUNG IN LONG GARLANDS FROM TREE TO TREE WHERE THE NIGHTINGALE SANG AND THE SUNBEAMS WERE PLAYING IT WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL BUT IT WAS NO PLACE FOR GIRLS TO GO
FOR NOBODY WENT FAR ENOUGH THAT ONE NOT FURTHER THAN THE OTHERS HOWEVER HE SAID THAT THE SOUND PROCEEDED FROM A VERY LARGE OWL IN A HOLLOW TREE A SORT OF LEARNED OWL THAT CONTINUALLY KNOCKED ITS HEAD AGAINST THE BRANCHES
IT'S CHANGED TIMES FOR BOTH OF US JOSEPH AND IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN WE CAN HAVE A CAB EVEN
THE UNCANNY CREATURES FLEW IN AND OUT AMONG THE TREES AND TENTS NOW SWOOPING LOW NEAR THE INDIANS OR THE TRAVELERS AT SUCH TIMES CLUBS WOULD BE USED OFTEN WITH THE EFFECT OF KILLING OR STUNNING THE FLYING PESTS
AND THE APPEARANCE OF THE WORTHY LADY RELIEVED HIM FROM AN AWKWARD EMBARRASSMENT THE CLERKS SURVEYED HIM WITH GREAT CURIOSITY AND HE NOT KNOWING WELL WHAT TO SAY TO THIS ASCENDING AND DESCENDING SCALE REMAINED TONGUE TIED
HE WAS ABOUT TO SEE IN REALITY A CERTAIN COFFER OF WHICH HE HAD TWENTY TIMES BEHELD THE IMAGE IN HIS DREAMS A COFFER LONG AND DEEP LOCKED BOLTED FASTENED IN THE WALL A COFFER OF WHICH HE HAD SO OFTEN HEARD
UPON THE EDGE OF WHICH FOR STILL GREATER PRECAUTION HE PLACED HIS FEET THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE TOOK PORTHOS INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM AND THEY BEGAN TO LAY THE BASIS OF A RECONCILIATION YOU CAN COME AND DINE THREE TIMES A WEEK
THE PROCURATOR REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AH MADAME COQUENARD ACCEPT MY COMPLIMENTS YOUR DINNER HAS BEEN A REAL FEAST LORD HOW I HAVE EATEN
THE PROCURATOR'S WIFE WAITED TREMBLINGLY TO HOW MUCH SAID SHE I HOPE IT DOES NOT EXCEED SHE STOPPED
THE CARDINAL WAS SPEAKING TO HIM IN A LOW VOICE AND THE KING WAS VERY PALE THE KING MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE CROWD WITHOUT A MASK AND THE RIBBONS OF HIS DOUBLET SCARCELY TIED HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE QUEEN AND IN AN ALTERED VOICE SAID
THAT'S WELL AS REGARDS MY HORSE BUT I MUST HAVE THE APPOINTMENTS COMPLETE AS THEY INCLUDE OBJECTS WHICH A MUSKETEER ALONE CAN PURCHASE AND WHICH WILL NOT AMOUNT BESIDES TO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED LIVRES
ENSIGN IN THE KING'S GUARDS FOLLOWED BY TWO OFFICERS AND SEVERAL ARCHERS OF THAT BODY CAME TO THE CITY REGISTRAR NAMED CLEMENT AND DEMANDED OF HIM ALL THE KEYS OF THE ROOMS AND OFFICES OF THE HOTEL
PORTHOS MADE A MOST SIGNIFICANT GRIMACE
THEN THE HAND WAS WITHDRAWN LEAVING IN HIS AN OBJECT WHICH HE PERCEIVED TO BE A RING THE DOOR IMMEDIATELY CLOSED AND D'ARTAGNAN FOUND HIMSELF AGAIN IN COMPLETE OBSCURITY D'ARTAGNAN PLACED THE RING ON HIS FINGER AND AGAIN WAITED
WAS DRAWN AND THE PALE FACE OF THE CARDINAL APPEARED HE BEING DRESSED AS A SPANISH CAVALIER HIS EYES WERE FIXED UPON THOSE OF THE QUEEN AND A SMILE OF TERRIBLE JOY PASSED OVER HIS LIPS THE QUEEN DID NOT WEAR HER DIAMOND STUDS
THE MILITARY DRESS WHICH INDICATED RANK AND A RUDDY COUNTENANCE WHICH INDICATED FAMILIARITY WITH GOOD LIVING A SHORTER CLERK CAME BEHIND THE FIRST A TALLER CLERK BEHIND THE SECOND
D'ARTAGNAN AT ONCE COMPREHENDED THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE HE CAST HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES SEIZED THE HAND AND TOUCHED IT RESPECTFULLY WITH HIS LIPS
LAYING THE BLAME UPON THE CARDINAL WHO HAD DETAINED HIM TILL ELEVEN O'CLOCK TALKING OF AFFAIRS OF STATE HIS MAJESTY IN FULL DRESS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS
IN HISTORY IT IS THE INDEPENDENCE OF PERSONALITY FREE WILL AS WITH ASTRONOMY THE DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING THE MOTION OF THE EARTH LAY IN ABANDONING THE IMMEDIATE SENSATION OF THE EARTH'S FIXITY
AND DELIVERED BY A SCARLET LIVERIED FOOTMAN THAT MORNING RAN AS FOLLOWS IF YOU HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO COUNT OR PRINCE AND IF THE PROSPECT OF SPENDING AN EVENING WITH A POOR INVALID IS NOT TOO TERRIBLE
ALL THESE FESTIVITIES AND FIREWORKS ARE BECOMING WEARISOME IF THEY HAD KNOWN THAT YOU WISHED IT THE ENTERTAINMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT OFF SAID THE PRINCE WHO LIKE A WOUND UP CLOCK
TO BE APPOINTED FIRST SECRETARY AT VIENNA THE BARON BY ALL ACCOUNTS IS A POOR CREATURE PRINCE VASILI WISHED TO OBTAIN THIS POST FOR HIS SON
JUST AS PROLONGED AND STUBBORN IS THE STRUGGLE NOW PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW CONCEPTION OF HISTORY AND THEOLOGY IN THE SAME WAY STANDS ON GUARD FOR THE OLD VIEW AND ACCUSES THE NEW VIEW OF SUBVERTING REVELATION
BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO REMEMBER A GOOD DEAL OF WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE NOW HERE IS A SENTENCE
WHERE HE DIED IN BOUNDLESS OBSCURITY IN TWELVE NINETY SEVEN BALIOL WAS SUCCEEDED BY THE BRAVE WILLIAM WALLACE WHO WON A GREAT BATTLE AT STIRLING BUT WAS AFTERWARDS DEFEATED ENTIRELY AT FALKIRK
AND PERCEPTION BEFITTING A MAN OF THE WORLD HE INDICATED BY A MOVEMENT OF THE HEAD THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING THIS INFORMATION DO YOU KNOW HE SAID AT LAST
BY HER SISTER WAS ALL SHE SAID IN A DRY AND MOURNFUL TONE AS SHE NAMED THE EMPRESS ANNA PAVLOVNA'S FACE SUDDENLY ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF PROFOUND AND SINCERE DEVOTION
OR PETRIFY IT PERSONAL PRONOUNS AND ADJECTIVES ARE A FRUITFUL NUISANCE IN THIS LANGUAGE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT FOR INSTANCE THE SAME SOUND
WITH THE GERMANS IT IS DOUBTLESS THE MARK AND SIGN OF A PRACTICED PEN AND OF THE PRESENCE OF THAT SORT OF LUMINOUS INTELLECTUAL FOG WHICH STANDS FOR CLEARNESS AMONG THESE PEOPLE FOR SURELY IT IS NOT
ARE MASSED TOGETHER BETWEEN A COUPLE OF KING PARENTHESES ONE OF WHICH IS PLACED IN THE FIRST LINE OF THE MAJESTIC SENTENCE AND THE OTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST LINE OF IT
N B I WAS INFORMED LATER BY A HIGHER AUTHORITY THAT THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION WHICH PERMITS ONE TO SAY
AS IN THE QUESTION OF ASTRONOMY THEN SO IN THE QUESTION OF HISTORY NOW THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IS BASED ON THE RECOGNITION OR NONRECOGNITION OF SOMETHING ABSOLUTE
BUT WAS CAUGHT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SWIM ACROSS THE RIVER
TOO MUCH DOES IT BECOME MONOLOGUE JUDICIOUSLY FED ONE CHARACTER GIVING AND THE OTHER TAKING BUT IN COMMENT IN REFERENCE IN DESCRIPTION IN EVERY DEVELOPMENT OF HIS STORY
HE HAS A CHOICE OF WORDS A WAY OF PUTTING THINGS WHICH IS AS INEVITABLY HIS OWN VINTAGE AS ONCE TASTED IT BECOMES THE PRIVATE VINTAGE OF THE CONNOISSEUR
A SECOND EXPEDITION WAS MADE IN THE SAME YEAR UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR BOLING WHEN THE VALLEY WAS ENTERED NO INDIANS WERE SEEN BUT THE MANY WIGWAMS WITH SMOLDERING FIRES
THOUGH IT BE AT HAND YEA AND BEFORE THERE SHALL APPEAR A RACE OF MEN WHO LOTH TO SIT STILL IN ONE PLACE SHALL BOLDLY GO BEFORE ALL PEOPLE'S EYES SUBORNING MEN OF DIVERS QUALITIES TO DRAW THEM
THE YOSEMITE OR GRIZZLY BEAR TRIBE FANCYING THEMSELVES SECURE IN THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD WERE THE MOST TROUBLESOME AND DEFIANT OF ALL AND IT WAS WHILE THE MARIPOSA BATTALION UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR SAVAGE
AND TO THE SOUND OF BELLS VANKA RAN TO THE FIRST POST BOX AND SLIPPED HIS PRECIOUS LETTER INTO THE SLIT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LULLED BY HOPE HE WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY
THROUGH AN INTERPRETER EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT THE OCCURRENCE BUT NOT A WORD DID TENAYA UTTER IN REPLY LATER
WHO TRUSTING TOO MUCH IN THEIR HOPEFUL TIME LIVE BUT A WHILE AND PERISH IN THEIR PRIME NEITHER SHALL ANY WHO THIS COURSE SHALL RUN LEAVE OFF THE RACE WHICH HE HATH ONCE BEGUN
SO ONE FELT THAT THIS WESTMINSTER FREE LANCE IN THE THIRTIES WAS NO FIT COMPETITOR FOR THE YOUTH OF OTHER COLLEGES INDEED IT COULD NOT COMPETE WELL I DISCOVERED HIM
THEREFORE I WILL NOT LIE TO YOU BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME RETURN TO MY PEOPLE I WILL BRING THEM IN HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO THE NEXT DAY HE CAME BACK
THIS LED TO ANOTHER YOSEMITE EXPEDITION A DETACHMENT OF REGULAR SOLDIERS FROM FORT MILLER UNDER LIEUTENANT MOORE U S A WAS AT ONCE DISPATCHED TO CAPTURE OR PUNISH THE MURDERERS
THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS ERECTED IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX AND WAS KEPT AS A HOTEL THE NEXT YEAR BY G A HITE AND LATER BY J H NEAL AND S M CUNNINGHAM
KEEP BACK DAMN YOU KEEP BACK IF YOU'VE A LIFE TO LOSE NONSENSE MY GOOD MAN SAID THE UNDERTAKER WHO WAS PRETTY WELL USED TO MISERY IN ALL ITS SHAPES NONSENSE
AND HE WISHED AS HE CREPT INTO HIS NARROW BED THAT THAT WERE HIS COFFIN AND THAT HE COULD BE LAIN IN A CALM AND LASTING SLEEP IN THE CHURCHYARD GROUND WITH THE TALL GRASS WAVING GENTLY ABOVE HIS HEAD
TRANSPORTING LARGE ARMIES OF FOREIGN MERCENARIES TO COMPLEAT THE WORKS OF DEATH DESOLATION AND TYRANNY ALREADY BEGUN WITH CIRCUMSTANCES OF CRUELTY AND PERFIDY SCARCELY PARALLELED IN THE MOST BARBAROUS AGES
DIFFICULT TASK FOR THE GRAVE WAS SO FULL THAT THE UPPERMOST COFFIN WAS WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE SURFACE
THE REGRET OF NO RECENT SEPARATION WAS FRESH IN HIS MIND THE ABSENCE OF NO LOVED AND WELL REMEMBERED FACE SANK HEAVILY INTO HIS HEART BUT HIS HEART WAS HEAVY NOTWITHSTANDING
HE HAS COMBINED WITH OTHERS TO SUBJECT US TO A JURISDICTION FOREIGN TO OUR CONSTITUTION AND UNACKNOWLEDGED BY OUR LAWS GIVING HIS ASSENT TO THEIR ACTS OF PRETENDED LEGISLATION
IS AN UNDISTINGUISHED DESTRUCTION OF ALL AGES SEXES AND CONDITIONS IN EVERY STAGE OF THESE OPPRESSIONS WE HAVE PETITIONED FOR REDRESS IN THE MOST HUMBLE TERMS
SAW HIM SAFELY OUT OF THE CHURCHYARD LOCKED THE GATE AND DEPARTED ON THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS WELL OLIVER SAID SOWERBERRY AS THEY WALKED HOME HOW DO YOU LIKE IT PRETTY WELL THANK YOU SIR
TO LOOK DIGNIFIED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT IS MORE ESPECIALLY SO WHEN SUPERADDED TO THESE PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS ARE A RED NOSE AND YELLOW SMALLS
AND ALTERING FUNDAMENTALLY THE FORMS OF OUR GOVERNMENTS FOR SUSPENDING OUR OWN LEGISLATURES AND DECLARING THEMSELVES INVESTED WITH POWER TO LEGISLATE FOR US IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER HE HAS ABDICATED GOVERNMENT HERE
SEND ME A LARGE CLOAK A GOOD WARM ONE FOR IT IS BITTER COLD WE SHOULD HAVE CAKE AND WINE TOO BEFORE WE GO NEVER MIND SEND SOME BREAD
WHO HAVING CONSOLED HIM WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT HE'D CATCH IT CONDESCENDED TO HELP HIM MISTER SOWERBERRY CAME DOWN SOON AFTER SHORTLY AFTERWARDS MISSUS SOWERBERRY APPEARED OLIVER HAVING CAUGHT IT IN FULFILMENT OF NOAH'S PREDICTION
AS THEIR NEGLECTED APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENTLY DENOTED WITHOUT THE CONCURRENT TESTIMONY AFFORDED BY THE SQUALID LOOKS OF THE FEW MEN AND WOMEN WHO WITH FOLDED ARMS AND BODIES HALF DOUBLED OCCASIONALLY SKULKED ALONG
BUT AS FOR THE OPINIONS WHICH UP TO THAT TIME I HAD EMBRACED I THOUGHT THAT I COULD NOT DO BETTER THAN RESOLVE AT ONCE TO SWEEP THEM WHOLLY AWAY THAT I MIGHT AFTERWARDS BE IN A POSITION TO ADMIT EITHER OTHERS MORE CORRECT
AND HE THOUGHT OF FINDING OUT THE WINE SHOP AGAIN AND TAKING COUNSEL WITH ITS MASTER IN REFERENCE TO THE SAFEST DWELLING PLACE IN THE DISTRACTED STATE OF THE CITY BUT THE SAME CONSIDERATION THAT SUGGESTED HIM
MY MIND TO THE LOVE AND NOURISHMENT OF TRUTH AND TO A DISTASTE FOR ALL SUCH REASONINGS AS WERE UNSOUND BUT I HAD NO INTENTION ON THAT ACCOUNT OF ATTEMPTING TO MASTER ALL
USING HIS NATURAL AND UNPREJUDICED JUDGMENT DRAWS RESPECTING THE MATTERS OF HIS EXPERIENCE AND BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL TO PASS THROUGH A STATE OF INFANCY TO MANHOOD AND HAVE BEEN OF NECESSITY FOR A LENGTH OF TIME
THE SINGLE DESIGN TO STRIP ONE'S SELF OF ALL PAST BELIEFS IS ONE THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE TAKEN BY EVERY ONE THE MAJORITY OF MEN IS COMPOSED OF TWO CLASSES
AND THE LAST IN EVERY CASE TO MAKE ENUMERATIONS SO COMPLETE AND REVIEWS SO GENERAL THAT I MIGHT BE ASSURED THAT NOTHING WAS OMITTED
I HAD LITTLE DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING THE OBJECTS WITH WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO COMMENCE FOR I WAS ALREADY PERSUADED THAT IT MUST BE WITH THE SIMPLEST AND EASIEST TO KNOW AND CONSIDERING THAT OF ALL THOSE WHO HAVE HITHERTO SOUGHT
AS A FIGURE TO FILL A DOORWAY THAT WOULD BEAR CONSIDERABLE KNOCKING ON THE HEAD AND RETAINED TO HIS OWN OCCUPATIONS A DISTURBED AND DOLEFUL MIND HE BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON THEM AND SLOWLY AND HEAVILY THE DAY LAGGED ON WITH HIM
I MIGHT ASCEND BY LITTLE AND LITTLE AND AS IT WERE STEP BY STEP TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MORE COMPLEX ASSIGNING IN THOUGHT A CERTAIN ORDER EVEN TO THOSE OBJECTS WHICH IN THEIR OWN NATURE DO NOT STAND IN A RELATION OF ANTECEDENCE AND SEQUENCE
WHO HAD LEFT HER IN EXACTLY THE SAME ATTITUDE SOME SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO IT IS SHE OBSERVED HER HUSBAND DOES MADAME GO WITH US INQUIRED MISTER LORRY SEEING THAT SHE MOVED AS THEY MOVED
OR WITH SAVAGES AND THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IN DRESS ITSELF THE FASHION WHICH PLEASED US TEN YEARS AGO AND WHICH MAY AGAIN PERHAPS BE RECEIVED INTO FAVOR BEFORE TEN YEARS HAVE GONE APPEARS TO US AT THIS MOMENT EXTRAVAGANT
AND THE CHILD IT IS ENOUGH MY HUSBAND SAID MADAME DEFARGE I HAVE SEEN THEM WE MAY GO BUT THE SUPPRESSED MANNER HAD ENOUGH OF MENACE IN IT
AND TO SPEAK OF HUMAN AFFAIRS I BELIEVE THAT THE PRE EMINENCE OF SPARTA WAS DUE NOT TO THE GOODNESS OF EACH OF ITS LAWS IN PARTICULAR FOR MANY OF THESE WERE VERY STRANGE AND EVEN OPPOSED TO GOOD MORALS BUT TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT
FOR THE EFFORT WHICH ON EARTH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME STANDING UPRIGHT CARRIED ME INTO THE MARTIAN AIR TO THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT THREE YARDS I ALIGHTED SOFTLY UPON THE GROUND HOWEVER WITHOUT APPRECIABLE SHOCK OR JAR
OF THE LITTLE DEVILS I HAD BEEN WATCHING BUT HOW PUNY AND HARMLESS THEY NOW LOOKED BESIDE THIS HUGE AND TERRIFIC INCARNATION OF HATE OF VENGEANCE AND OF DEATH
BUT I WAS NOT LONG IN BEING ENLIGHTENED THEY FIRST REPEATED THE WORD SAK A NUMBER OF TIMES AND THEN TARS TARKAS MADE SEVERAL JUMPS REPEATING THE SAME WORD BEFORE EACH LEAP THEN TURNING TO ME HE SAID SAK
THEY WERE CONVERSING TOGETHER IN LOW TONES AND GESTICULATING AND POINTING TOWARD ME THEIR DISCOVERY THAT I HAD NOT HARMED THE LITTLE MARTIANS AND THAT I WAS UNARMED MUST HAVE CAUSED THEM
THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN TRUE UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS ON AN ARIZONA DESERT HERE AND THERE WERE SLIGHT OUTCROPPINGS OF QUARTZ BEARING ROCK WHICH GLISTENED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE TO MY LEFT PERHAPS A HUNDRED YARDS APPEARED A LOW WALLED ENCLOSURE
OF INCITANTS TO MERRIMENT THE DEATH AGONIES OF A FELLOW BEING ARE TO THESE STRANGE CREATURES PROVOCATIVE OF THE WILDEST HILARITY WHILE THEIR CHIEF FORM OF COMMONEST AMUSEMENT
SO WHY NOT THEN ON MARS PLACING MY HAND OVER MY HEART I BOWED LOW TO THE MARTIAN AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WHILE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS LANGUAGE
TO FORM A HUGE CANOPY ABOVE THE ENTRANCE HALL THERE WAS NO STAIRWAY BUT A GENTLE INCLINE TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING OPENED INTO AN ENORMOUS CHAMBER ENCIRCLED BY GALLERIES ON THE FLOOR OF THIS CHAMBER
NOW COMMENCED A SERIES OF EVOLUTIONS WHICH EVEN THEN SEEMED LUDICROUS IN THE EXTREME I FOUND THAT I MUST LEARN TO WALK ALL OVER AGAIN
AS I TURNED TO MEET IT UNARMED AND NAKED AS I WAS THE FIRST LAW OF NATURE MANIFESTED ITSELF IN THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF MY IMMEDIATE PROBLEM AND THAT WAS TO GET OUT OF THE VICINITY
WHICH FACT HAD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE NOISELESSNESS OF THEIR APPROACH AND IN COMMON WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF LEGS IS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE FAUNA OF MARS THE HIGHEST TYPE OF MAN
IN AVIATION AND IN WAR BUT PERHAPS BY FAR THE GREATEST DEATH LOSS COMES DURING THE AGE OF CHILDHOOD WHEN VAST NUMBERS OF THE LITTLE MARTIANS FALL VICTIMS TO THE GREAT WHITE APES OF MARS
I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
THERE WAS MYRA WHO TREATED LOVERS LIKE DOGS AND WOULD SLAP THEM ACROSS THE FACE WITH A BANANA SKIN TO SHOW HER UTTER INDEPENDENCE AND THERE WAS MISS CLEGHORN WHO WAS SALLOW AND WHO BOUGHT A FORTY CENT ANCIENT HISTORY TO IMPROVE HERSELF AND YET IF SHE'D HIT ANY MAN IN MARIPOSA WITH A BANANA SKIN
UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
FOR ALL I KNOW THIS CUBAN STUFF MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM MORGAN HIMSELF SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MARIPOSA SAID YES OTHERS SAID NO THERE WAS NO CERTAINTY ANYWAY THEY WERE FAIR AND STRAIGHT THIS CUBAN CROWD THAT WROTE TO JEFF
AND SINCE THAT THOUGH IT'S QUITE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE SHOP'S OPEN TILL ELEVEN EVERY NIGHT NOW AND JEFF IS SHAVING AWAY TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE HUNDRED THAT JOHNSON THE LIVERY MAN SENT TO THE CUBANS AND PATHETIC TUT TUT YOU DON'T KNOW MARIPOSA
THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPER
I BOUGHT HER SAID JEFF AT THIRTY TWO AND SHE STAYED RIGHT THERE TIGHT LIKE SHE WAS STUCK
AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT ALL ROUND THE BRITISH EMPIRE DELIVERING ADDRESSES ON IMPERIAL ORGANIZATION WHEN I STATE THAT THESE LECTURES WERE FOLLOWED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA THE BANANA RIOTS IN TRINIDAD AND THE TURCO ITALIAN WAR
JEFF LAID DOWN WHAT HE WAS READING AND STARTED TO TALK ABOUT CARNEGIE THIS CARNEGIE I BET YOU WOULD BE WORTH SAID JEFF CLOSING UP HIS EYES IN CALCULATION AS MUCH AS PERHAPS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WAS TO SELL HIM UP
AND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSA
SO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAY
I SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
WHERE HE GOT IT ALL I DON'T KNOW BUT I AM INCLINED TO THINK IT CAME MORE OR LESS OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS IN THE CITY PEOPLE NEVER READ THE NEWSPAPERS NOT REALLY ONLY LITTLE BITS AND SCRAPS OF THEM BUT IN MARIPOSA IT'S DIFFERENT THERE
BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT SUCH REFLECTIONS IMPELLED ME AS THOUGH PURPOSELY TO PUT MYSELF INTO A FALSE POSITION I WENT IN
AND FOR THAT VERY REASON I QUITE CONTENTEDLY OCCUPIED THE LOWEST IN REALITY EITHER TO BE A HERO OR TO GROVEL IN THE MUD THERE WAS NOTHING BETWEEN
ON THE CONTRARY I PASSIONATELY LONGED TO SHOW ALL THAT RABBLE THAT I WAS BY NO MEANS SUCH A SPIRITLESS CREATURE AS I SEEMED TO MYSELF WHAT IS MORE EVEN IN THE ACUTEST PAROXYSM OF THIS COWARDLY FEVER I DREAMED OF GETTING THE UPPER HAND
ONE COULD SEE THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS THIRTY HE WOULD BE CORPULENT
EVEN A SIGNIFICANCE TO MY DISSIPATION IN FACT COMPLETELY ANSWERED THE PURPOSE OF AN APPETISING SAUCE THERE WAS A CERTAIN DEPTH OF MEANING IN IT AND I COULD HARDLY HAVE RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE SIMPLE VULGAR DIRECT DEBAUCHERY OF A CLERK
ALL THIS DISCONCERTED ME I SAT DOWN FEELING RATHER MISERABLE AND BEGAN LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE ENGAGED IN WARM AND EARNEST CONVERSATION ABOUT A FAREWELL DINNER WHICH THEY WANTED TO ARRANGE FOR THE NEXT DAY TO A COMRADE OF THEIRS CALLED ZVERKOV
BUT THESE HAD NOT LASTED LONG AND HAD SOMEHOW BEEN SUDDENLY CLOUDED OVER HE WAS EVIDENTLY UNCOMFORTABLE AT THESE REMINISCENCES AND WAS I FANCY ALWAYS AFRAID THAT I MIGHT TAKE UP THE SAME TONE AGAIN
A LITTLE FELLOW WITH THE FACE OF A MONKEY A BLOCKHEAD WHO WAS ALWAYS DERIDING EVERYONE A VERY BITTER ENEMY OF MINE FROM OUR DAYS IN THE LOWER FORMS A VULGAR IMPUDENT SWAGGERING FELLOW WHO AFFECTED A MOST SENSITIVE FEELING
TO SUBDUE TO ATTRACT THEM
ONE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER OF A PARTICULARLY FRUGAL AND SALLOW APPEARANCE HE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR AUNT WHO USED TO POUR OUT THE TEA OF THE DAUGHTERS ONE WAS THIRTEEN AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN
I WENT TO THE OFFICE HOWEVER AS USUAL BUT SNEAKED AWAY HOME TWO HOURS EARLIER TO GET READY THE GREAT THING I THOUGHT IS NOT TO BE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE OR THEY WILL THINK I AM OVERJOYED AT COMING BUT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SUCH
AND YET YOU ARE RIGHT IT REALLY IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE
WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD DINNER ZVERKOV OF COURSE WON'T PAY OF COURSE NOT SINCE WE ARE INVITING HIM SIMONOV DECIDED CAN YOU IMAGINE FERFITCHKIN INTERRUPTED HOTLY AND CONCEITEDLY
I HATED THE ABRUPT SELF CONFIDENT TONE OF HIS VOICE HIS ADMIRATION OF HIS OWN WITTICISMS
SWIFT PICTURES OF HIMSELF APART YET IN HIMSELF CAME TO HIM A BLUE DESPERATE FIGURE LEADING LURID CHARGES WITH ONE KNEE FORWARD AND A BROKEN BLADE HIGH A BLUE DETERMINED FIGURE
THEY BEGAN TO HAVE THOUGHTS OF A SOLEMN CEREMONY THERE WAS SOMETHING RITE LIKE IN THESE MOVEMENTS OF THE DOOMED SOLDIER AND THERE WAS A RESEMBLANCE IN HIM TO A DEVOTEE OF A MAD RELIGION BLOOD SUCKING MUSCLE WRENCHING BONE CRUSHING
IF THE MEN WERE ADVANCING THEIR INDIFFERENT FEET WERE TRAMPLING UPON HIS CHANCES FOR A SUCCESSFUL LIFE AS THESE THOUGHTS WENT RAPIDLY THROUGH HIS MIND HE TURNED UPON THEM AND TRIED TO THRUST THEM AWAY
IF THE ARMY HAD GONE GLORIOUSLY ON HE WOULD BE LOST IF THE DIN MEANT THAT NOW HIS ARMY'S FLAGS WERE TILTED FORWARD HE WAS A CONDEMNED WRETCH HE WOULD BE COMPELLED TO DOOM HIMSELF TO ISOLATION
AS THE LATTER SLOWLY TURNED HIS WAXLIKE FEATURES TOWARD HIM THE YOUTH SCREAMED
AND IN THE SAME WAY DHARMU'S WIFE MIGHT HAVE ACTED AS OVERSEER OF THE WOMEN BUT SHE WAS ASHAMED NOT TO WORK TOO ONE DAY THEY WERE TRANSPLANTING THE RICE AND KARMU BROUGHT OUT BREAKFAST FOR THE LABOURERS
LET HER DO SO IN FUTURE AND SHE WILL BE FREED AND THE WOMAN HAS HER FEET BURNING IN THE FIRE BECAUSE SHE PUSHED THE FUEL INTO THE FIRE WITH HER FOOT LET HER NOT DO SO IN FUTURE AND SHE WILL BE FREED
FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS FALL HE CONSIDERED NOW HOWEVER THAT IT WAS USELESS TO THINK OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY
AND ONCE AS HIS FRIEND ROLLED HIS EYES HE SAW SOMETHING IN THEM THAT MADE HIM SINK WAILING TO THE GROUND HE RAISED HIS VOICE IN A LAST SUPREME CALL JIM JIM JIM
TO FORCE THEIR WAY TO GRIM CHANCES OF DEATH AS HE WATCHED HIS ENVY GREW UNTIL HE THOUGHT THAT HE WISHED TO CHANGE LIVES WITH ONE OF THEM HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE USED A TREMENDOUS FORCE HE SAID THROW OFF HIMSELF AND BECOME A BETTER
SO THEY ROSE UP TO GO BACK AND DHARMU ASKED ABOUT THE WOMEN WHOM THEY HAD MET AND KARAM GOSAIN SAID THE WOMAN HAS A STOOL STUCK TO HER BACK BECAUSE WHEN VISITORS CAME SHE NEVER OFFERED THEM A SEAT
AND THEY HAD NOTHING TO GIVE THEM IN THE NIGHT DHARMU'S WIFE SAID THEY PROMISED TO PAY US FOR MERELY LOOKING AFTER THE WORK AND INSTEAD WE WORKED HARD AND HAVE STILL GOT NOTHING WE WILL NOT WORK FOR THEM ANYMORE
AND SEE WHAT THE EAST WAS LIKE IN WARTIME SHE SET OUT FOR WASHINGTON IN OCTOBER JUST BEFORE THE WAR ENDED SHE HAD DETERMINED ON WASHINGTON BECAUSE IT WAS LESS INTIMIDATING THAN THE OBVIOUS NEW YORK BECAUSE SHE HOPED TO FIND STREETS IN WHICH HUGH COULD PLAY
THE POORER HOUSES OF GOPHER PRAIRIE WHERE THE SERVICES OF MILES BJORNSTAM WERE A LUXURY WHICH INCLUDED THE SHANTY OF MILES BJORNSTAM WERE BANKED TO THE LOWER WINDOWS WITH EARTH AND MANURE
CHAPTER THIRTY SIX KENNICOTT WAS NOT SO INHUMANLY PATIENT THAT HE COULD CONTINUE TO FORGIVE CAROL'S HERESIES TO WOO HER AS HE HAD ON THE VENTURE TO CALIFORNIA SHE TRIED TO BE INCONSPICUOUS
REALIZE HOW VALUABLE SHE WILL BE TO ANY WAR BOARD WITH WHICH SHE CHOOSES TO BECOME CONNECTED GOPHER PRAIRIE THUS ADDS ANOTHER SHINING STAR TO ITS SERVICE FLAG AND WITHOUT WISHING TO KNOCK ANY NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES
WHICH HE HELD IN HIS MOUTH LIKE AN EXTRAORDINARY SET OF EXTERNAL FALSE TEETH THE UNIVERSAL SIGN OF WINTER WAS THE TOWN HANDYMAN MILES BJORNSTAM A TALL THICK RED MUSTACHED BACHELOR OPINIONATED ATHEIST GENERAL STORE ARGUER
THROUGH LATE NOVEMBER AND ALL DECEMBER IT SNOWED DAILY THE THERMOMETER WAS AT ZERO AND MIGHT DROP TO TWENTY BELOW OR THIRTY WINTER IS NOT A SEASON IN THE NORTH MIDDLEWEST IT IS AN INDUSTRY
THE LAST THING SHE SAW ON THE STATION PLATFORM WAS KENNICOTT FAITHFULLY WAVING HIS HAND HIS FACE SO FULL OF UNCOMPREHENDING LONELINESS THAT HE COULD NOT SMILE BUT ONLY TWITCH UP HIS LIPS SHE WAVED TO HIM AS LONG AS SHE COULD
BUT ONE THING I'M NOT GOING TO STAND I'M NOT GOING TO STAND MY OWN WIFE BEING SEDITIOUS YOU CAN CAMOUFLAGE ALL YOU WANT TO BUT YOU KNOW DARN WELL THAT THESE RADICALS AS YOU CALL EM ARE OPPOSED TO THE WAR AND LET ME TELL YOU RIGHT HERE AND NOW
SO THE WHOLE THING WAS ILLEGAL AND LED BY THE SHERIFF PRECISELY HOW DO YOU EXPECT THESE ALIENS TO OBEY YOUR LAW IF THE OFFICER OF THE LAW TEACHES THEM TO BREAK IT IS IT A NEW KIND OF LOGIC
WHAT EDITORIAL DID HE GET THAT FROM SHE WONDERED AS SHE PROTESTED SEE HERE MY BELOVED WHY CAN'T YOU TORIES DECLARE WAR HONESTLY YOU DON'T OPPOSE THIS ORGANIZER BECAUSE YOU THINK HE'S SEDITIOUS
AND THEY'D HAVE ANOTHER SKIING EXPEDITION RIGHT AWAY AND THEY JOLLILY RETURNED HOME AND NEVER THEREAFTER LEFT THEIR MANUALS OF BRIDGE CAROL WAS DISCOURAGED SHE WAS GRATEFUL WHEN KENNICOTT INVITED HER TO GO RABBIT HUNTING IN THE WOODS
AND IF I HAD MY WAY I'D MAKE YOU FOLKS LIVE UP TO THE ESTABLISHED RULES OF DECENCY EVEN IF I HAD TO TAKE YOU WILL SHE WAS NOT TIMOROUS NOW AM I PRO GERMAN IF I FAIL TO THROB TO HONEST JIM BLAUSSER TOO
VALENTINE DURST NOT OPPOSE HER GRANDMOTHER'S WISH THE CAUSE OF WHICH SHE DID NOT KNOW AND AN INSTANT AFTERWARDS VILLEFORT ENTERED
THOUGH SHE HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO PUT ON THE OUTWARD SEMBLANCE OF WOE SHE THEN TURNED TOWARDS THE AVENUE AS SHE ADVANCED SHE FANCIED SHE HEARD A VOICE SPEAKING HER NAME SHE STOPPED ASTONISHED
BUT LIKE A PHOSPHORIC LIGHT THEY RISE BUT TO MISLEAD THE STORY HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE CORSICAN TO SOME PRIEST WHO IN HIS TURN HAS REPEATED IT
HAD FOLLOWED HIS WIFE MEANWHILE BARROIS HAD RETURNED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO OLD NOIRTIER WHO HAVING HEARD THE NOISE IN THE HOUSE HAD AS WE HAVE SAID SENT HIS OLD SERVANT TO INQUIRE THE CAUSE ON HIS RETURN
AND GRANDPAPA
THEIR NUMBER WAS FORMIDABLE NOW THAT HE HAD BEGUN TO FEAR AND YET THESE NAMES POWERFUL THOUGH THEY WERE HAD OFTEN CAUSED HIM TO SMILE WITH THE SAME KIND OF SATISFACTION EXPERIENCED BY A TRAVELLER WHO
AND DIFFICULT AND HER PULSE BEAT WITH FEVERISH EXCITEMENT SHE WAS THINKING OF THE DESPAIR OF MAXIMILIAN WHEN HE SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT MADAME DE SAINT MERAN INSTEAD OF BEING AN ALLY WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY ACTING AS HIS ENEMY
SAID THE OLD LADY VILLEFORT PLACED THE ARM OF MADAME DE SAINT MERAN WITHIN HIS OWN AND CONDUCTED HER TO HIS APARTMENT REST YOURSELF MOTHER HE SAID THE MARCHIONESS RAISED HER HEAD AT THIS WORD
WHILE MADAME DE VILLEFORT LEANING ON HER HUSBAND'S ARM MAINTAINED ALL OUTWARD FORMS OF RESPECT AT LEAST TOWARDS THE POOR WIDOW SHE SOON WHISPERED TO HER HUSBAND I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME TO RETIRE
DOES HE NOT DISLIKE THE IDEA OF MARRYING THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A JACOBIN OUR CIVIL DISSENSIONS ARE NOW HAPPILY EXTINGUISHED MOTHER SAID VILLEFORT
AND VALENTINE SEATED HERSELF AT THE BEDSIDE OF HER GRANDMOTHER THE POOR CHILD APPEARED HERSELF TO REQUIRE THE DOCTOR SHE HAD RECOMMENDED TO HER AGED RELATIVE A BRIGHT SPOT BURNED IN EITHER CHEEK HER RESPIRATION WAS SHORT
WHOM YOU HAVE SO SOON FORGOTTEN SIR AH MADAME SAID VILLEFORT YOU FORGET THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO GIVE A MOTHER TO MY CHILD A STEPMOTHER IS NEVER A MOTHER SIR BUT THIS IS NOT TO THE PURPOSE
AND WENT HIMSELF TO FETCH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER FROM MADAME DE MORCERF'S HE WAS SO PALE WHEN HE APPEARED AT THE DOOR OF THE BALL ROOM THAT VALENTINE RAN TO HIM SAYING OH FATHER SOME MISFORTUNE HAS HAPPENED
AND BROKE UP HIS CAMP AND ADVANCED THE TEMPER OF THE GENERAL WAS WHAT IT HAD BEEN AT PYLOS HIS SUCCESS ON THAT OCCASION HAVING GIVEN HIM CONFIDENCE IN HIS CAPACITY
CALLING TO HIS STANDARD FIFTEEN HUNDRED THRACIAN MERCENARIES AND ALL THE EDONIANS HORSE AND TARGETEERS HE ALSO HAD A THOUSAND MYRCINIAN AND CHALCIDIAN TARGETEERS BESIDES THOSE IN AMPHIPOLIS
WILL YOU BE SO BLINDED AS TO CHOOSE THE WORSE AND IT IS CERTAIN THAT THOSE WHO DO NOT YIELD TO THEIR EQUALS WHO KEEP TERMS WITH THEIR SUPERIORS AND ARE MODERATE TOWARDS THEIR INFERIORS ON THE WHOLE SUCCEED BEST
IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONG AND THAT IF WE DO NOT MOLEST THEM IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID SO THAT BESIDES EXTENDING OUR EMPIRE WE SHOULD GAIN IN SECURITY BY YOUR SUBJECTION
THE FLOWER OF THE ATHENIAN ARMY BEING IN THE FIELD WITH THE BEST OF THE LEMNIANS AND IMBRIANS HE THEREFORE PREPARED TO ASSAIL THEM BY STRATAGEM BY SHOWING THE ENEMY THE NUMBER OF HIS TROOPS AND THE SHIFTS
WHENCE HOWEVER THEY ALL CAME HOME AFTERWARDS THE PELOPONNESIANS ON THE CONCLUSION OF PEACE AND THE REST BY BEING EXCHANGED AGAINST OTHER PRISONERS WITH THE OLYNTHIANS ABOUT THE SAME TIME PANACTUM
NO COWARDICE THEN ON YOUR PART SEEING THE GREATNESS OF THE ISSUES AT STAKE AND I WILL SHOW THAT WHAT I PREACH TO OTHERS I CAN PRACTISE MYSELF
AND ALSO FELL IN WITH SOME LOCRIAN SETTLERS EXILED FROM MESSINA WHO HAD BEEN SENT THITHER WHEN THE LOCRIANS WERE CALLED IN BY ONE OF THE FACTIONS THAT DIVIDED MESSINA AFTER THE PACIFICATION OF SICILY
SINCE IN TOO MANY CASES THE VERY MEN THAT HAVE THEIR EYES PERFECTLY OPEN TO WHAT THEY ARE RUSHING INTO LET THE THING CALLED DISGRACE BY THE MERE INFLUENCE OF A SEDUCTIVE NAME
WHO WAS TO BRING AS MANY THRACIAN MERCENARIES AS POSSIBLE
MEANWHILE HE HAD BEEN SEEN COMING DOWN FROM CERDYLIUM AND THEN IN THE CITY WHICH IS OVERLOOKED FROM THE OUTSIDE SACRIFICING NEAR THE TEMPLE OF ATHENE IN SHORT ALL HIS MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN OBSERVED
AND FANCYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO RETIRE
HE DID NOT VENTURE TO GO OUT IN REGULAR ORDER AGAINST THE ATHENIANS HE MISTRUSTED HIS STRENGTH AND THOUGHT IT INADEQUATE TO THE ATTEMPT NOT IN NUMBERS THESE WERE NOT SO UNEQUAL BUT IN QUALITY
WHO COULD ILLUMINATE PRINCIPLE WITH THE WIDEST KNOWLEDGE A MAN WHOSE LEARNING ALMOST AMOUNTED TO A PROOF OF WHATEVER HE BELIEVED DOROTHEA'S INFERENCES MAY SEEM LARGE
SIR HUMPHRY DAVY SAID MISTER BROOKE OVER THE SOUP IN HIS EASY SMILING WAY TAKING UP SIR JAMES CHETTAM'S REMARK THAT HE WAS STUDYING DAVY'S AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY WELL NOW SIR HUMPHRY DAVY
HE DELIVERED HIMSELF WITH PRECISION AS IF HE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT AND THE BALANCED SING SONG NEATNESS OF HIS SPEECH OCCASIONALLY CORRESPONDED TO BY A MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD
IF YOU WILL ONLY MENTION THE TIME THANK YOU YOU ARE VERY GOOD I MEAN TO GIVE UP RIDING I SHALL NOT RIDE ANY MORE SAID DOROTHEA URGED TO THIS BRUSQUE RESOLUTION BY A LITTLE ANNOYANCE THAT SIR JAMES WOULD BE SOLICITING HER ATTENTION
THE EXCELLENT DRAWING ROOM FURNITURE BY THE BEST MAKERS THE RARE AND FAMOUS WINES SELECTED REGARDLESS OF COST AND WITH THE WELL KNOWN TASTE OF THE PURCHASER THE RICH AND COMPLETE SET OF FAMILY PLATE HAD BEEN SOLD ON THE PREVIOUS DAYS
AND PRONOUNCE HIM A GOOD NATURED JOVIAL RECKLESS FELLOW
SENT THIS LITTLE SPAR OUT OF THE WRECK WITH THEIR LOVE TO GOOD MISSUS SEDLEY AND WITH RESPECT TO THE PIANO AS IT HAD BEEN AMELIA'S AND AS SHE MIGHT MISS IT AND WANT ONE NOW AND AS CAPTAIN WILLIAM DOBBIN COULD NO MORE PLAY UPON IT THAN HE COULD DANCE ON THE TIGHT ROPE
AND THERE SAW ANOTHER OFFICER WITH A YOUNG LADY ON HIS ARM WHO BOTH APPEARED TO BE HIGHLY AMUSED WITH THE SCENE AND TO WHOM FINALLY
GREAT MISTAKE CHETTAM INTERPOSED MISTER BROOKE GOING INTO ELECTRIFYING YOUR LAND AND THAT KIND OF THING AND MAKING A PARLOR OF YOUR COW HOUSE IT WON'T DO I WENT INTO SCIENCE A GREAT DEAL MYSELF AT ONE TIME
MISTER CASAUBON HAD COME UP TO THE TABLE TEACUP IN HAND AND WAS LISTENING WE MUST NOT INQUIRE TOO CURIOUSLY INTO MOTIVES HE INTERPOSED IN HIS MEASURED WAY
PRETTY THING IS IT NOT SWEET MINIATURE
THE AROMA IS MIXED WITH THE GROSSER AIR WE MUST KEEP THE GERMINATING GRAIN AWAY FROM THE LIGHT DOROTHEA COLORED WITH PLEASURE AND LOOKED UP GRATEFULLY TO THE SPEAKER
IS NOTHING BUT A MAN ON A GRAY ASS LIKE MY OWN WHO CARRIES SOMETHING SHINY ON HIS HEAD JUST SO ANSWERED DON QUIXOTE AND THAT RESPLENDENT OBJECT IS THE HELMET OF MAMBRINO
BLUSHING IN A VERY HURRIED AND DISCOMFITED MANNER TURNED AWAY HIS HEAD SHALL WE SAY TWENTY GUINEAS FOR THIS WORK OF ART FIFTEEN FIVE NAME YOUR OWN PRICE THE GENTLEMAN WITHOUT THE ELEPHANT IS WORTH FIVE POUND
FROM THE FATE WITH WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD WAS THREATENING IT AND AS HE RECKONED SO IT BEFELL THE DEPUTY GOVERNOR ADDED HIS OWN PASSIONATE PLEADING TO THE PROPOSALS OF THE LETTER BUT DON MIGUEL WAS OF STOUTER HEART
WAS ALMOST AS SORELY DAMAGED BY THE FIRE SHE HAD SUSTAINED FROM THE BUCCANEERS BEFORE SURRENDERING CLEARLY THEN HE WAS COMPELLED TO ADMIT IN THE END THAT NOTHING REMAINED
THEN CRASHED ALONGSIDE TO GRAPPLE AND BOARD HER WHILST HAGTHORPE WAS DOING THE LIKE BY THE SAN FELIPE AND IN ALL THIS TIME NOT A SINGLE SHOT HAD THE SPANIARDS CONTRIVED TO FIRE SO COMPLETELY HAD THEY BEEN TAKEN BY SURPRISE
HERE THAT COUNCIL OF WAR COMPOSED OF SIX MEN IN ALL DELIBERATED UNTIL LATE THAT NIGHT UPON THE PLAN OF ACTION WHICH CAPTAIN BLOOD PUT FORWARD THE GREAT FRESHWATER LAKE OF MARACAYBO
IN THE ALREADY CORDIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN CAPTAIN BLOOD AND THE GOVERNOR OF TORTUGA AT THE FINE STONE HOUSE WITH ITS GREEN JALOUSIED WINDOWS
THE ADMIRAL GOT HIS CREW ASHORE ON PALOMAS AS BEST HE COULD AND THEN JUST AS CAPTAIN BLOOD ACCOUNTED THE VICTORY WON AND THAT HIS WAY OUT OF THAT TRAP TO THE OPEN SEA BEYOND LAY CLEAR THE FORT SUDDENLY REVEALED ITS FORMIDABLE
ROUND FROM LA GUAYRA BY A GUARDA COSTA AND IF YE HADN'T LOST LA FOUDRE AND SO REDUCED OUR FLEET FROM THREE SHIPS TO TWO WE SHOULD EVEN NOW BE ABLE TO FIGHT OUR WAY THROUGH WITH A REASONABLE HOPE OF SUCCEEDING YET YOU THINK IT IS FOR YOU TO COME HECTORING HERE
HE HAD IT IN THE PESSIMISM OF WHICH CAHUSAC DID NOT ECONOMIZE EXPRESSIONS TRANSPORTED AT FIRST TO HEIGHTS OF DIZZY SATISFACTION BY THE SWIFT AND EASY VICTORY OF THEIR INFERIOR FORCE THAT MORNING
AND LONG TONGUES OF FLAME WERE LICKING OUT TO CONSUME THE GALLEON BEATING BACK THOSE DARING SPANIARDS WHO TOO LATE
PITT TELLS US A DREADFUL KIND OF ENGLISH WHICH THE SHIPMASTER HOWEVER MAKES LITTLE ATTEMPT TO REPRODUCE HIS DRESS WAS AS DISCORDANT AS HIS SPEECH IT WAS OF A KIND TO ADVERTISE HIS TRADE
YOU CALL ME A COWARD I'LL TAKE THAT LIBERTY THE BRETON GLARED AT HIM BREATHING HARD BUT HE HAD NO MIND TO ASK SATISFACTION FOR THE INSULT HE KNEW TOO WELL THE KIND OF SATISFACTION
THE CATS THEY WAIT FOR US THE CATS ARE THOSE FOUR SPANISH SHIPS OF WAR THAT HAVE COME MEANTIME AND THEY WAIT FOR US OUTSIDE THE BOTTLE NECK OF THIS LAGOON
AND ONE HUNDRED HEAD OF CATTLE AS A RANSOM THEREAFTER GRANTING ME UNMOLESTED PASSAGE OF THE BAR MY PRISONERS MOST OF WHOM ARE PERSONS OF CONSIDERATION I WILL RETAIN AS HOSTAGES UNTIL AFTER MY DEPARTURE
FOLLOWED BY GUARDS HIS MOMENTARY TRUCULENCE UTTERLY SPENT BUT NO SOONER HAD HE DEPARTED THAN UP LEAPT CAHUSAC
AND BEEN QUITE SATISFIED HE DRESSED HIMSELF ALL IN HIS BEST AND AT LAST GOT OUT INTO THE STREETS THE PEOPLE WERE BY THIS TIME POURING FORTH
STARTING OFF AGAIN AND GOING ROUND THE FIREPLACE THERE'S THE DOOR BY WHICH THE GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY ENTERED THERE'S THE CORNER WHERE THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT SAT
WHO HAD DIM EYES COULD NOT SEE IT AND THOUGHT IT WAS HANSEL'S FINGER AND WAS ASTONISHED THAT THERE WAS NO WAY OF FATTENING HIM WHEN FOUR WEEKS HAD GONE BY AND HANSEL STILL REMAINED THIN
YES AND THE BEDPOST WAS HIS OWN THE BED WAS HIS OWN THE ROOM WAS HIS OWN BEST AND HAPPIEST OF ALL THE TIME BEFORE HIM WAS HIS OWN
AND I WILL LIGHT A FIRE THAT YOU MAY NOT BE COLD HANSEL AND GRETEL GATHERED BRUSHWOOD TOGETHER AS HIGH AS A LITTLE HILL THE BRUSHWOOD WAS LIGHTED AND WHEN THE FLAMES WERE BURNING VERY HIGH THE WOMAN SAID
THEY SAW A BEAUTIFUL SNOW WHITE BIRD SITTING ON A BOUGH WHICH SANG SO DELIGHTFULLY THAT THEY STOOD STILL AND LISTENED TO IT AND WHEN ITS SONG WAS OVER IT SPREAD ITS WINGS AND FLEW AWAY BEFORE THEM
SAT BY THE FIRE AND WHEN NOON CAME EACH ATE A LITTLE PIECE OF BREAD AND AS THEY HEARD THE STROKES OF THE WOOD AXE THEY BELIEVED THAT THEIR FATHER WAS NEAR IT WAS NOT THE AXE HOWEVER
HOW ARE WE TO FEED OUR POOR CHILDREN WHEN WE NO LONGER HAVE ANYTHING EVEN FOR OURSELVES I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HUSBAND ANSWERED THE WOMAN EARLY TOMORROW MORNING WE WILL TAKE THE CHILDREN OUT INTO THE FOREST
AND SIDLED HIS FACE IN ROUND THE DOOR THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE TABLE WHICH WAS SPREAD OUT IN GREAT ARRAY FOR THESE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPERS ARE ALWAYS NERVOUS ON SUCH POINTS AND LIKE TO SEE THAT EVERYTHING IS RIGHT FRED
UNTIL THE MOON HAS RISEN AND THEN WE WILL SOON FIND THE WAY AND WHEN THE FULL MOON HAD RISEN HANSEL TOOK HIS LITTLE SISTER BY THE HAND AND FOLLOWED THE PEBBLES WHICH SHONE LIKE NEWLY COINED SILVER PIECES
I THANK YOU FIFTY TIMES BLESS YOU HE WENT TO CHURCH AND WALKED ABOUT THE STREETS AND WATCHED THE PEOPLE HURRYING TO AND FRO AND PATTED CHILDREN ON THE HEAD AND QUESTIONED BEGGARS
REALLY FOR A MAN WHO HAD BEEN OUT OF PRACTICE FOR SO MANY YEARS IT WAS A SPLENDID LAUGH A MOST ILLUSTRIOUS LAUGH THE FATHER OF A LONG LONG LINE OF BRILLIANT LAUGHS
BE ASSURED THAT FOR MY OWN SAKE AS WELL AS YOURS I WILL NOT RASHLY ENCOUNTER DANGER I WILL BE COOL PERSEVERING AND PRUDENT BUT SUCCESS SHALL CROWN MY ENDEAVOURS WHEREFORE NOT
WHENEVER THE SAFETY OF OTHERS IS COMMITTED TO MY CARE I CANNOT DESCRIBE TO YOU MY SENSATIONS ON THE NEAR PROSPECT OF MY UNDERTAKING
IN THE AFFIRMATIVE MY COURAGE AND MY RESOLUTION IS FIRM BUT MY HOPES FLUCTUATE AND MY SPIRITS ARE OFTEN DEPRESSED I AM ABOUT TO PROCEED ON A LONG AND DIFFICULT VOYAGE THE EMERGENCIES OF WHICH WILL DEMAND ALL MY FORTITUDE
THERE SNOW AND FROST ARE BANISHED AND SAILING OVER A CALM SEA WE MAY BE WAFTED TO A LAND SURPASSING IN WONDERS AND IN BEAUTY EVERY REGION HITHERTO DISCOVERED ON THE HABITABLE GLOBE ITS PRODUCTIONS AND FEATURES
TO THE LAST GENERATION BY DISCOVERING A PASSAGE NEAR THE POLE TO THOSE COUNTRIES TO REACH WHICH AT PRESENT SO MANY MONTHS ARE REQUISITE OR BY ASCERTAINING THE SECRET OF THE MAGNET
BEING EVEN NOW IN WRECK SO ATTRACTIVE AND AMIABLE I SAID IN ONE OF MY LETTERS MY DEAR MARGARET THAT I SHOULD FIND NO FRIEND ON THE WIDE OCEAN YET I HAVE FOUND A MAN WHO BEFORE HIS SPIRIT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY MISERY
WE PERCEIVED A LOW CARRIAGE FIXED ON A SLEDGE AND DRAWN BY DOGS PASS ON TOWARDS THE NORTH AT THE DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE A BEING WHICH HAD THE SHAPE OF A MAN
OUR SITUATION WAS SOMEWHAT DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY AS WE WERE COMPASSED ROUND BY A VERY THICK FOG WE ACCORDINGLY LAY TO HOPING THAT SOME CHANGE WOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND WEATHER
THE STRANGER HAS GRADUALLY IMPROVED IN HEALTH BUT IS VERY SILENT AND APPEARS UNEASY WHEN ANYONE EXCEPT MYSELF ENTERS HIS CABIN YET HIS MANNERS ARE SO CONCILIATING AND GENTLE THAT THE SAILORS ARE ALL INTERESTED IN HIM
BUT BESIDES THIS THERE IS A LOVE FOR THE MARVELLOUS A BELIEF IN THE MARVELLOUS INTERTWINED IN ALL MY PROJECTS WHICH HURRIES ME OUT OF THE COMMON PATHWAYS OF MEN
AND THE WORLD BEFORE YOU AND HAVE NO CAUSE FOR DESPAIR BUT I I HAVE LOST EVERYTHING AND CANNOT BEGIN LIFE ANEW AS HE SAID THIS HIS COUNTENANCE BECAME EXPRESSIVE OF A CALM
I DO NOT KNOW THAT THE RELATION OF MY DISASTERS WILL BE USEFUL TO YOU YET WHEN I REFLECT THAT YOU ARE PURSUING THE SAME COURSE EXPOSING YOURSELF TO THE SAME DANGERS WHICH HAVE RENDERED ME WHAT I AM
