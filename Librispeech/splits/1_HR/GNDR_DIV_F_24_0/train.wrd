AND THUS THE TREASURE VALLEY BECAME A GARDEN AGAIN AND THE INHERITANCE WHICH HAD BEEN LOST BY CRUELTY WAS REGAINED BY LOVE AND GLUCK WENT AND DWELT IN THE VALLEY AND THE POOR WERE NEVER DRIVEN FROM HIS DOOR
AS THE MAN ENTERED THE ROOM MARGARET AROSE AND FACED HIM THE ENGLISHMAN WAS WELL DRESSED AND NEWLY SHAVEN AND WORE A ROSEBUD IN HIS BUTTONHOLE EVIDENTLY HE HAD SPENT SOME TIME OVER HIS TOILET IN HONOR OF THE OCCASION I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU UP AND LOOKING SO WELL
THEY HAD FOUR COMFORTABLE ROOMS TO LIVE IN A NEW WINDMILL BOUGHT ON CREDIT A CHICKEN HOUSE AND POULTRY MISSUS SHIMERDA HAD PAID GRANDFATHER TEN DOLLARS FOR A MILK COW AND WAS TO GIVE HIM FIFTEEN MORE AS SOON AS THEY HARVESTED THEIR FIRST CROP
AND THEN NOT ONLY HENRY HIMSELF BUT THE ENORMOUS CROWD AS WELL BEGAN TO SEE HOW FAST HE COULD RUN SLOWLY HE GAINED ON THE FELLOW AHEAD OF HIM AND PASSED HIM WITH THE NEXT FELLOW AS A GOAL HE GRADUALLY CREPT ALONGSIDE AND PASSED HIM WITH A SPURT THE CROWD SHOUTED ITSELF HOARSE
AND THE STORM BROKE THEM OFF AND CAST THEM ON THE GROUND THE OLD OAK HAD NOW ONLY A FEW LEAVES LEFT AT THE VERY TOP THE END IS NEAR HE SAID GRAVELY
AND THEY WERE DESTROYING AT LEAST THE QUALITY OF THE HOPS I ISSUED A HOP CIRCULAR SENDING IT TO MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED CORRESPONDENTS ALL ALONG THE COAST IN CALIFORNIA OREGON WASHINGTON AND BRITISH COLUMBIA
MANY THANKS ANSWERED THE BEECHES WE CAN GROW VERY NICELY IN THE SHADE AND THE WHOLE SUMMER PASSED BY AND ANOTHER SUMMER AFTER THAT AND STILL MORE SUMMERS THE BEECHES WENT ON GROWING
AT LAST HIGGINS FOUND WORDS MAN I COULD FELL YO TO THE GROUND FOR TEMPTING ME
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT HA HA HA
WHAT IS IT SIR SHE ASKED RISING BUT TREMBLING WITH TERROR AS SHE STOOD WITH DROOPING ARMS AND WIDELY OPENED EYES THE OLD MAN LOOKED AT HER FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN SAID SLOWLY THAT THIS IMPOSTOR WHO SO LONG HAS FALSELY BORNE MY NAME
I HOPE THAT ERE TRIAL HASN'T BROKE HIS SPIRIT BUT IT LOOKS BAD WERY BAD
WHAT THEY DOES THEY DOES
EVERY ONE TURNED FOWLER AND BEGAN TO HUNT THE PRECIOUS BIRDS
EACH OF US A GOLDEN CROWN ON HIS HEAD KING SOLOMON SMILED AND ANSWERED CROWNS OF GOLD SHALL YOU HAVE BUT YOU ARE FOOLISH BIRDS MY HOOPOES AND WHEN THE EVIL DAYS SHALL COME UPON YOU AND YOU SEE THE FOLLY OF YOUR DESIRE
SUBSTANCE OR MIND STUFF WILL CAUSE FUNCTION TO BE PERFORMED IN SUCH A WAY THAT YOUR BODY WILL BE REBUILT WITH PERFECTLY HEALTHY CELLS THE INTELLIGENT SUBSTANCE FROM WHICH ALL THINGS ARE MADE
SHE SAID WITH HESITATION I'LL TELL YOU BY AND BY I MUST GO IN DOORS I HAVE HAD NO BREAKFAST BY A SORT OF DIVINATION HIS CONJECTURE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FACT NOR I SAID HE LIGHTLY
THE FISHES ANSWERED
THERE CERTAINLY COULD BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THE DEVIL SIDE OF IT IT WAS AN AWFUL SITUATION TO BE IN AND ONE TO TERRIFY ANYBODY WE WERE ACTUALLY PRISONERS PENNED IN WITH ALL THOSE SAVAGES
OR IF IT BE SUBJECTED TO LOCAL PRESSURE THE PART OF THE BRAIN SO ACTED UPON CEASES TO BE CAPABLE OF EXERCISING ITS FUNCTIONS THE REGULARITY OF THE ACTION OF THE BRAIN AND THE SANITY AND COMPLETENESS OF THE THOUGHT
KNOCK THEM ON THE SIDE AND SCOOP THEM OUT WITH A SPOON AND PUT BUTTER ON TOP THE CHILDREN DID AS THE LITTLE COOK REQUESTED SPRINKLED ON A LITTLE SALT FROM THE SALT SHAKER AND TOOK A TASTE AH SAID HENRY IT'S
FOLLOWING THE PRACTICE USED IN MOST NAVIES WHILE THE LONGBOAT COASTED DROPS OF LIQUID FLICKED FROM THE OARS AND HIT THE DARK TROUGHS OF THE WAVES PITTER PATTERING LIKE SPLASHES OF MOLTEN LEAD
BUT THEN WHY ENCOURAGE HIM TO FOLLOW YOU HITHER MISS MILNER WHY COMMIT A THOUSAND FOLLIES SHE REPLIED IN TEARS EVERY HOUR OF MY LIFE YOU THEN PROMOTE THE HOPES OF LORD FREDERICK WITHOUT ONE SERIOUS INTENTION OF COMPLETING THEM
AND BECAUSE I WAS HUNGRY FOR THIS HE WAVED HIS HAND TOWARD THE GLOWING SKY AND THE FOREST CLAD HILLS THIS IS GOOD FOR ME IT SOMEHOW SEEMS TO HELP ME KNOW HOW BIG GOD IS ONE COULD FIND PEACE HERE
TOMMIE RAN HOLDING THE STRING THAT WAS FAST TO THE KITE AND UP AND UP AND UP IT WENT IN THE AIR SOON IT WAS SAILING QUITE NEAR THE CLOUDS
THAN CORN LAND MISTER POYSER WAS LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HIS MOUTH SCREWED UP
MISTER POYSER HAD JUST ENTERED IN SHIRT SLEEVES AND OPEN WAISTCOAT WITH A FACE A SHADE REDDER THAN USUAL FROM THE EXERTION OF PITCHING AS HE STOOD RED ROTUND AND RADIANT
AND WAS SOON HIDDEN AMONG THE TREES LIZZIE WAS STANDING QUIETLY BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD A FEW PACES OFF WITH HER BACK TO ME MY YOUNG MISTRESS WAS SITTING EASILY WITH A LOOSE REIN
SHE ROSE WHEN THE SPARROWS BEGAN TO WALK OUT OF THE ROOF HOLES SAT ON THE FLOOR OF HER ROOM IN THE DIM LIGHT AND BY AND BY PEEPED OUT BEHIND THE WINDOW CURTAINS IT WAS EVEN NOW DAY OUT OF DOORS
YOU WON'T FORGET MY FATHER JIM NO I SAID I WILL NEVER FORGET HIM MISSUS SHIMERDA ASKED ME TO STAY FOR SUPPER AFTER AMBROSCH AND ANTONIA HAD WASHED THE FIELD DUST FROM THEIR HANDS AND FACES AT THE WASH BASIN BY THE KITCHEN DOOR
TRIED TO RESTRAIN HIM BUT THE HEAD STRONG BOY THOUGH OWNING FOR HIS MOTHER THAT STRONG LOVE WHICH IS OFTEN A PART OF SUCH VIOLENT NATURES PROVED INTRACTABLE AND AFTER THREE YEARS OF PARENTAL FEUD HE WENT OFF TO THE CONTINENT
DIFFICULT NO THERE AIN'T NOTHING TO DO BUT TENDIN TO THE SHEEP THE MAN HAS TO STAY AT THE RANCH OF NIGHTS THOUGH MISTER HOWITT WAS WONDERING WHAT STAYING AT THE RANCH NIGHTS COULD HAVE TO DO WITH THE DIFFICULTY
IN SUMMER WHEN THE DAYS ARE LONG PERHAPS YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THE SONG IN AUTUMN WHEN THE LEAVES ARE BROWN TAKE PEN AND INK
OH ESTRALLA ISN'T STUPID NOT A BIT REPLIED SYLVIA LAUGHINGLY ESTRALLA WHO WAS CAREFULLY PUTTING THE LITTLE TABLE IN ORDER
THOUGH IT MUST SHOCK COULD NOT INTIMIDATE HENRY WHO WAS SUSTAINED IN HIS PURPOSE BY A CONVICTION OF ITS JUSTICE HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AS MUCH IN HONOUR AS IN AFFECTION TO MISS MORLAND
IS THERE ONE FOR SOUTH CAROLINA ASKED GRACE AS MISSUS CARLETON FOUND TWO SMALL THIMBLES WHICH SHE SAID SHE HAD USED WHEN SHE WAS NO OLDER THAN SYLVIA AND SHOWED THE GIRLS HOW TO SEW THE WHITE STARS SECURELY ON THE BLUE
SHE TURNED HER FACE AWAY SUDDENLY AH NONE OF THAT NONE OF THAT I CANNOT COQUET WITH YOU SHE CRIED DON'T SUPPOSE I CONSENT TO FOR ONE MOMENT OUR POOR BRIEF YOUTHFUL HOUR OF LOVE MAKING WAS TOO LONG AGO TO BEAR CONTINUING NOW
OARS IN POSITION FIVE OF THE NAUTILUS'S SAILORS WERE WAITING FOR US ABOARD THE SKIFF WHICH WAS MOORED ALONGSIDE THE NIGHT WAS STILL DARK LAYERS OF CLOUDS CLOAKED THE SKY AND LEFT ONLY A FEW STARS IN VIEW
WHO GAVE THE LITTLE OAK A CLOUT ON THE HEAD WITH ONE OF HIS LOWEST BOUGHS HOLD YOUR TONGUE HE SAID AND DON'T TALK TILL YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT YOU NEED NONE OF YOU BELIEVE A WORD OF THE BEAR'S NONSENSE
I THINK EMMALINE HE CONCLUDED I WILL ASK ANTONIA TO COME OVER AND HELP YOU IN THE KITCHEN SHE WILL BE GLAD TO EARN SOMETHING AND IT WILL BE A GOOD TIME TO END MISUNDERSTANDINGS I MAY AS WELL RIDE OVER THIS MORNING AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS
FOR LIFE WAS NOT SO DREADFUL A THING AFTER ALL AND HE GAVE HER PERMISSION TO BUILD HER NEST UNDER THE WALLS OF THE GREAT TEMPLE WHICH HE WAS BUILDING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GOLDEN HOUSE IN THE WHOLE WORLD
HE HAS ONE ARM OVER THE BACK OF THE CHAIR AND HE SEEMS TO BE LOOKING DOWN AT HIS CLASPED HANDS HE IS ROUSED BY A KNOCK AT THE DOOR
HE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN IN THE LAP OF ONE OF THE SAILORS HAVING HIS BACK STROKED HIS PLEASURE UPON THOSE OCCASIONS WAS EVINCED BY THE EMISSION OF FREQUENT GOOD NATURED GRUNTS AND LOOKING UP INTO THE FACE OF THE FRIENDLY STROKER
IT WAS AS IF YOU WAS A INSECT AND HE WAS GOING TO DAB HIS FINGER NAIL ON YOU HOWEVER SHE SAID YOUR SERVANT SIR AND CURTSIED WITH AN AIR OF PERFECT DEFERENCE AS SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM SHE WAS NOT THE WOMAN TO MISBEHAVE TOWARDS HER BETTERS
EVEN IF THEY DID HAPPEN TO COME BUT WE'VE GOT TO CHANCE IT SIR EVERYTHING'S GONE RIGHT SO FAR AND LET'S HOPE WE SHALL KEEP ON THE SAME TRACK I HOPE SO REPLIED THE DOCTOR THEN NOW WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO BUT GET BACK TO THE NARROW GATEWAY
TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AFTER AWHILE SHE WAS TAKEN TO THE CARRIAGE AND WE CAME HOME TOGETHER I HEARD MY MASTER SAY TO A GENTLEMAN WHO STOPPED HIM TO INQUIRE THAT HE HOPED NO BONES WERE BROKEN BUT THAT SHE HAD NOT SPOKEN YET
LOOKING AT THE KITE STRING WHICH WAS PULLING AT THE STUMP VERY HARD NOW BUT BEFORE YOU TAKE ME AWAY WOULD YOU MIND PULLING DOWN TOMMIE'S KITE ASKED THE BUNNY UNCLE I'LL LEAVE IT FOR HIM YES
AND THE BRASS PLATE OF THE COMPASS CASE SPARKLED IN THE SUN LIKE A JEWEL
A LOOKING GLASS AND A LIVE WAITER
UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS TALKED DEAR WOMAN TO HERSELF OR TO THE LORD IF THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO LISTEN BUT GRANDFATHER WAS NATURALLY TACITURN
NEVER HAPPENED TO IT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO BEWARE
AND RIDDEN FAR AWAY BEFORE ANYONE IN THE SLEEPY TOWN FOUND IT OUT WELL WHEN THOSE INSIDE HAD BEEN GIVEN OR HAD HELPED THEMSELVES TO WHATEVER THEY WANTED OUT THEY ALL MARCHED AGAIN QUICKLY AND SILENTLY
THE TRAINED EYE OF THE JUDGE BEING SUFFICIENT GUIDE TO THE SIZE OF THE COMPETITORS ACCORDING TO HIS PARTIALITY FOR MIDDLE SIZE BIG OR LITTLE ANIMALS THE SOUTH DURHAM AND YORKSHIRE SHOW AT DARLINGTON
AND WITH AN EXPRESSION OF COUNTENANCE WHICH SEEMED TO DENOTE THAT HE WAS GREATLY AMUSED WITH SOMETHING OR OTHER WALKED MERRILY AWAY
DIANA HAD NEVER LIKED LYDIA
SHE COULD GATHER NO ELATION OF SPIRITS NOW BY LOOKING FORWARD BUT ONLY BY LOOKING BACKWARD TO BUILD CONFIDENCE ON PAST WORDS AND CARESSES BUT OCCASIONALLY SINCE THURSDAY EVENING HER DIM ANXIETIES HAD BEEN ALMOST LOST BEHIND THE MORE DEFINITE FEAR
I NEVER SAW A CROWN LIKE THIS UPON ANY BIRD I MUST ASK ABOUT THIS
HAVE THE GOODNESS TO STEP DOWNSTAIRS CERT'NLY SIR REPLIED MISTER WELLER AND ACTING ON MISTER PICKWICK'S GENTLE HINT SAM RETIRED NO PERKER SAID MISTER PICKWICK WITH GREAT SERIOUSNESS OF MANNER
AT THE EDGE AND SO CAME THE LONG SCISSORS TO CUT OFF THE JAGGED PART OH SAID THE COLLAR YOU ARE CERTAINLY THE FIRST OPERA DANCER
WELL YES A FEW SAID THE AMERICAN COOLLY BUT THEY'RE JUST ABOUT NOTHING TO WHAT YOU COULD TEACH ME I CRIED CHRIS STARING AT HIM IN WONDER
OR SPEAK INGENUOUSLY
IN THE HOUSE OF A FRIENDLY NEIGHBOR AND GONE AWAY PEOPLE SAID THAT A CERTAIN LAXITY HAD CREPT INTO HIS LIFE THAT HE HAD NEVER GONE NEAR A CHURCH LATTERLY AND HAD BEEN SOMETIMES SEEN ON SUNDAYS WITH UNBLACKED BOOTS LYING ON HIS ELBOW UNDER A TREE
THEN CAME THE WARM BOX IRON
YOU OBSERVE THIS CONFINED BAY A MONTH FROM NOW IN THIS VERY PLACE THE NUMEROUS FISHING BOATS OF THE HARVESTERS WILL GATHER AND THESE ARE THE WATERS THEIR DIVERS WILL RANSACK SO DARINGLY THIS
BUT MY PACE SOON CURED THAT DIFFICULTY AND HE FOUND THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO STICK TO THE SADDLE AND HOLD ME IN WHICH HE DID MANFULLY I SHOOK HIM AS LITTLE AS I COULD HELP BUT ONCE OR TWICE
HE SAW A LITTLE DOG LYING ON THE ROCKS GASPING FOR BREATH JUST AS HANS HAD SEEN IT ON THE DAY OF HIS ASCENT AND GLUCK STOPPED AND LOOKED AT IT AND THEN AT THE GOLDEN RIVER NOT FIVE HUNDRED YARDS ABOVE HIM
WE RODE AWAY LAUGHING AND GRANDFATHER SAID
THESE SOLDIERS ARE NOT NEARLY AS NICE AS ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THEM TO BE WHEN ONE SEES THEM DRESSED UP IN THEIR BLUE UNIFORMS WITH BRIGHT BRASS BUTTONS AND THEY CAN MAKE MISTAKES TOO FOR YESTERDAY WHEN I ASKED THAT SAME MAN A QUESTION
INTENT THEREBY REJOINED THE FOX HEAR THEN O MY FRIEND
READY AND WILLING SIR I GO FIRST DON'T I YES WITH CHRIS AS ADVANCE GUARD
INDEED JACK SAID JONES YOU WILFULLY MISUNDERSTAND ME
ONLY TAKE CARE NOT TO DRINK ANY OF THE WINE WHICH ONE OF THE PRINCESSES WILL BRING TO YOU IN THE EVENING AND AS SOON AS SHE LEAVES YOU PRETEND TO BE FAST ASLEEP THEN SHE GAVE HIM A CLOAK AND SAID
I DO FROM MY HEART ANSWERED JONES OF HAVING DEBAUCHED THE GIRL BUT NOT FROM HAVING GAINED HER AFFECTIONS IF I HAVE SAID NIGHTINGALE I AM SORRY FOR IT
BECAUSE THAT WAS WHERE HE HAD FIRST MET HIS DEAD WIFE HE HAD LIVED SO MUCH IN THE OPEN AIR THAT HIS SKIN WAS AS DARK AS A RED INDIAN'S AND WHEN HE LAUGHED HIS TEETH WERE LIKE SNOW AND HIS EYES LIKE THE SEA ON A SUNNY DAY
SOME OF THESE SHELLS WERE FURROWED WITH FLAKY GREENISH BANDS THAT RADIATED DOWN FROM THE TOP THESE WERE THE YOUNG OYSTERS THE OTHERS HAD RUGGED BLACK SURFACES MEASURED UP TO FIFTEEN CENTIMETERS IN WIDTH
MARGARET'S STRENGTH GAVE OUT AND SUDDENLY SHE SANK DOWN ON HER KNEES ALL IN ARE YOU HE SAID NOT UNKINDLY AND STOOPING HE PICKED HER UP BODILY SHE TRIED TO RESIST BUT COULD NOT AND HE TOOK HER INTO THE COTTAGE AND PLACED HER ON A COUCH I'LL GET YOU A NURSE
BUT I DIDN'T AND GRACE LAUGHED GOOD NATUREDLY BUT FLORA TURNED HER FACE FROM THEM AND BEGAN TO CRY AFTER MY BEING HURT AND SHE SOBBED BUT STOPPED QUICKLY SYLVIA AND GRACE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER IN AMAZEMENT
THEY ARE TAKING OUR STRENGTH OUT OF US THEY SAID AND SHOOK AS MUCH AS THE BEECHES AROUND WOULD LET THEM THE LAND IS OURS NO LONGER ONE BOUGH DIED AFTER ANOTHER
CHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFE
AND SUFFICIENT IN NUMBER TO DOMINATE ALL THE ACCESSORY DECORATIONS OF THE ROOM WHEN THERE ARE BOOKS ENOUGH IT IS BEST TO USE THEM AS PART OF THE DECORATIVE TREATMENT OF THE WALLS
HIS PARTICULAR ADMIRERS DECLARED THAT HE LEARNED THE MEANING OF THE DIFFERENT WHISTLES OF THE BOATSWAIN THAT HE KNEW WHEN THE MEAL PENNANT WAS HOISTED TO THE PEAK COULD TELL WHEN THE CREW WAS BEAT TO QUARTERS FOR DRILL
OR A BLUE FLY OR A FLY WITH PALE WINGS LIKE A DISTANT RAIN CLOUD FLOATING DOWN ON THE TOP OF THE WATER AND PROBABLY WONDERING WHERE IT HAD GOT TO AND THEN THEY WOULD HEAR A LITTLE NOISE LIKE GROWN UP PEOPLE MAKE WITH THE TIPS OF THEIR TONGUES AGAINST THE ROOFS OF THEIR MOUTHS
BUT WHERE ARE THE MULES AND PONIES FATHER SAID CHRIS AS THEY HURRIED NOW IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TERRACED CLIFF ON THEIR RIGHT HOBBLED AND GRAZING AT THE FOOT OF OUR CLIFF UNDER SHELTER OF A COUPLE OF RIFLES BUT THERE ARE MORE INDIANS AT THE MOUTH OF THE GULCH
WHOM SHOULD THE CATERPILLAR CONSULT THERE WAS THE SHAGGY DOG WHO SOMETIMES CAME INTO THE GARDEN BUT HE WAS SO ROUGH HE WOULD MOST LIKELY WHISK ALL THE EGGS OFF THE CABBAGE LEAF WITH ONE BRUSH OF HIS TAIL
CERTAINLY NOT REPLIED MISTER PICKWICK EAGERLY NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT JUMP UP TO YOUR SEAT DIRECTLY I AM WERY MUCH AFEERED MUTTERED SAM TO HIMSELF AS HE TURNED AWAY THAT SOMETHIN QUEER'S COME OVER THE GOVERNOR OR HE'D NEVER HA STOOD THIS SO QUIET
THE ONE IDEA THAT HAD EVER GOT THROUGH POOR MAREK'S THICK HEAD WAS THAT ALL EXERTION WAS MERITORIOUS HE ALWAYS BORE DOWN ON THE HANDLES OF THE CULTIVATOR AND DROVE THE BLADES SO DEEP INTO THE EARTH THAT THE HORSES WERE SOON EXHAUSTED
MISSUS CARLETON HURRIEDLY EXPLAINED SYLVIA'S STARTING OFF TO FIND ESTRALLA AND HER OWN DEPARTURE SHE BLAMED HERSELF THAT SHE HAD PERMITTED SYLVIA TO GO OUT ALONE SHE MUST BE SOMEWHERE ABOUT THE FORT DECLARED CAPTAIN CARLETON
I WONDERED WHY FUCHS HAD NOT STUCK TO CABINET WORK HE SETTLED DOWN TO IT WITH SUCH EASE AND CONTENT HE HANDLED THE TOOLS AS IF HE LIKED THE FEEL OF THEM AND WHEN HE PLANED HIS HANDS WENT BACK AND FORTH OVER THE BOARDS IN AN EAGER BENEFICENT WAY AS IF HE WERE BLESSING THEM
BUT THE YOUNGEST SAID I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS WHILE YOU ARE SO HAPPY I FEEL VERY UNEASY I AM SURE SOME MISCHANCE WILL BEFALL US YOU SIMPLETON SAID THE ELDEST YOU ARE ALWAYS AFRAID
AND TO INCREASE IN SIZE AND NUMBERS WITH EVERY STEP THEIR COMING WAS SO SUDDEN WE DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO GET OUT OF THEIR WAY AND IT SO HAPPENED THAT MISSUS PHILLIPS AND I WERE IN THEIR LINE OF MARCH
HE NEVER MET THEM AGAIN AND IN THE CONTINUATION OF THIS MOURNFUL HISTORY THEY WILL NOT BE MET WITH ANY MORE TOWARDS THE END OF THIS FOURTH YEAR JEAN VALJEAN'S TURN TO ESCAPE ARRIVED
THEY RETURNED TO THE WHITE HART AND DESPATCHED SAM ON THE ERRAND TO WHICH HIS MASTER HAD PLEDGED HIM SAM WELLER PUT ON HIS HAT IN A VERY EASY AND GRACEFUL MANNER AND THRUSTING HIS HANDS IN HIS WAISTCOAT POCKETS WALKED WITH GREAT DELIBERATION TO QUEEN SQUARE
ONLY MY NONSENSE DOCTOR SAID GRIGGS CHEERILY MY FAINTNESS IS THE SAME AS SQUIRE'S HERE WE WANT OUR BREAKFAST HORRIBLY OH CRIED THE DOCTOR SMILING
AND FINDING HIS BODY SOFT AND BEING THIRSTY DRANK OF HIS BLOOD
IT SOUNDED LOUD BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S SO STILL AND WE EXPECT THAT EVERYTHING MEANS DANGER KEEP CLOSE BEHIND ME NOW
YOU WILL BE SURPRISED TO FIND HOW EASILY YOU CAN CONQUER PAIN AND AFTER YOU HAVE LIVED FOR A TIME IN THIS SCIENTIFIC WAY PAINS AND ACHES WILL BE THINGS UNKNOWN TO YOU WHAT SHALL I DO WHEN I AM TOO WEAK FOR MY WORK
THEY'RE JUST GOING TO WAKE UP THAT'S WHAT IT SEEMS LIKE IN IN BETWEEN LAND LIZ STIRRED AGAIN AND HE SHIFTED HER ON HIS KNEES A LITTLE
OUT OF SIGHT JUST AS QUICKLY IT LOOKS TO ME VERY MUCH AS IF PETER RABBIT IS OVER THERE AND FEELING VERY NERVOUS SAID CHATTERER TO HIMSELF AND THEN HE CALLED SHARPLY JUST AS WHEN
FOR THE OLD SQUIRE'S VISITS TO HIS TENANTRY WERE RARE AND THOUGH MISSUS POYSER HAD DURING THE LAST TWELVEMONTH RECITED MANY IMAGINARY SPEECHES MEANING EVEN MORE THAN MET THE EAR
HIS LEGS CROSSED LIKE A TURK ON THE TOP OF A HIGH WALL SUCH A NARROW ONE THAT ALICE QUITE WONDERED HOW HE COULD KEEP HIS BALANCE AND
THE HOMAGE OF A THOUSAND HEARTS THE FOND DEEP LOVE OF ONE EVERYTHING HAD BEEN CLEAR THEN IN IMAGINATION NOW SOMETHING WAS UNDEFINED SHE HAD LITTLE CARKING ANXIETIES A CURIOUS FATEFULNESS SEEMED TO RULE HER
BUD WILSON HE SURE SEED OLD MATT'S THE OTHER INTERRUPTED REALLY YOUNG MAN I MUST GO IT IS ALREADY LATE AND YOU KNOW I HAVE YET TO FIND A PLACE TO STAY FOR THE NIGHT LAW THAT'S ALRIGHT MISTER REPLIED JED
IF THERE BE TRUTH IN SIGHT HE SAID YOU ARE MY ROSALIND I WILL HAVE NO FATHER IF YOU BE NOT HE SHE SAID TO THE DUKE AND TO ORLANDO I WILL HAVE NO HUSBAND IF YOU BE NOT HE
THE NOISE OF THE FRAY ALARMED THE NEIGHBORS WHO FINDING THEY COULD NOT PACIFY THE COMBATANTS SENT FOR THE CONSTABLE HANS ON HEARING THIS CONTRIVED TO ESCAPE AND HID HIMSELF
AS SHE WOULD HAVE SPOKEN MORE HE HAD SHAKEN OFF HIS EMOTION AS IF HE WAS ASHAMED OF HAVING EVER GIVEN WAY TO IT
WHAT A FINE OLD KITCHEN THIS IS SAID MISTER DONNITHORNE LOOKING ROUND ADMIRINGLY HE ALWAYS SPOKE IN THE SAME DELIBERATE WELL CHISELLED POLITE WAY WHETHER HIS WORDS WERE SUGARY OR VENOMOUS
HE SAT AT A WORM EATEN DESK COVERED WITH FILES OF WAITERS CHECKS SO OLD THAT I WAS SURE THE BOTTOMEST ONE WAS FOR CLAMS THAT HENDRIK HUDSON HAD EATEN AND PAID FOR
OUGHT I YES THAT YOU OUGHT THOSE FELLOWS SHOOT VERY STRAIGHT AND SEND THOSE THIN SPLINTS OF WOOD WITH TREMENDOUS FORCE THEY DO SIGHED CHRIS MY POOR MUSTANG AH
IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL BLUE MORNING THE BUFFALO PEAS WERE BLOOMING IN PINK AND PURPLE MASSES ALONG THE ROADSIDE AND THE LARKS PERCHED ON LAST YEAR'S DRIED SUNFLOWER STALKS WERE SINGING STRAIGHT AT THE SUN THEIR HEADS THROWN BACK AND THEIR YELLOW BREASTS A QUIVER
AND CLEARER THEY PAUSED AT THE DOOR AND THEN MOVED TOWARDS THE WINDOW WHERE MISSUS CLEAR WAS STANDING IS THAT YOU SAID A LOW VOICE WHICH CAME WEIRDLY OUT OF THE DARKNESS YES
HUMPTY DUMPTY SMILED CONTEMPTUOUSLY OF COURSE YOU DON'T TILL I TELL YOU I MEANT THERE'S A NICE KNOCK DOWN ARGUMENT FOR YOU
WILL SHOW HOW SELDOM THE DETACHED BOOKCASE WAS USED IN FRENCH LIBRARIES BUT FEW MODELS ARE TO BE FOUND AND THESE WERE PROBABLY DESIGNED FOR USE IN THE BOUDOIR OR STUDY
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS AWAKENED BY FEELING HIMSELF BEING PULLED AT FIRST
IF IT WERE BUT FOR AN END WHICH AFFECTED THE GOOD OF ALL INSTEAD OF THAT OF MERELY ONE CLASS AS OPPOSED TO ANOTHER I RECKON IT'S TIME FOR ME TO BE GOING SIR SAID HIGGINS AS THE CLOCK STRUCK TEN HOME
RIGHT AWAY PETER'S HEAD BOBBED UP FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A JACK IN THE BOX AND THIS TIME IT STAYED UP PETER'S EYES WERE ROUND WITH SURPRISE AS HE STARED ACROSS AT CHATTERER'S PRISON
DESPITE MISSUS VICKERS'S REITERATED OBJECTIONS ON THE SCORE OF EDUCATIONAL DIFFICULTIES HE COULD EDUCATE HER HIMSELF IF NEED BE HE SAID AND SHE SHOULD NOT STAY AT HOME SO MISSUS VICKERS AFTER A HARD STRUGGLE GAVE UP THE POINT AND HER DREAMS OF BATH TOGETHER
AND LIKE THE BROWN EYES BETRAYED THE REAL STRENGTH OF THE MAN DENIED BY HIS GRAY HAIR AND BENT FORM THE TONES WERE AS DIFFERENT FROM THE HIGH KEYED SLURRING SPEECH OF THE BACKWOODS AS THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF WAS UNLIKE ANY MAN JED HAD EVER MET
AND A BEAUTIFUL ONE AS YOU SAY IT'S A PRESENT FROM THE WHITE KING AND QUEEN THERE NOW IS IT REALLY SAID ALICE QUITE PLEASED TO FIND THAT SHE HAD
HE THEN TOLD NIGHTINGALE HE SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO LODGE IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM AND IT WAS ACCORDINGLY AGREED BETWEEN THEM THAT NIGHTINGALE SHOULD PROCURE HIM EITHER THE GROUND FLOOR
HORSES AND ALL THE KING'S MEN COULDN'T PUT HUMPTY DUMPTY IN HIS PLACE AGAIN THAT LAST LINE IS MUCH TOO LONG FOR THE POETRY SHE ADDED
MUST BE FROM NEW YORK SURE SLOWLY THE OLD MAN TOILED UP THE MOUNTAIN UP FROM THE MISTS OF THE LOWER GROUND TO THE RIDGE ABOVE
AND THESE WERE HANGING FROM STICKS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FIRE AND HE HAD WRAPPED HER IN A BLANKET AND SOON SHE WAS FAST ASLEEP LYING ON HIS KNEES AS HE SAT AND SMOKED HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING A LOT BUT AT LAST HE LOOKED AT CUTHBERT
TO WHAT HAVE TENDED ALL THOSE ELEGANT AND LUSCIOUS DESCRIPTIONS OF HAPPINESS ARISING FROM VIOLENT AND MUTUAL FONDNESS ALL THOSE WARM PROFESSIONS OF TENDERNESS AND GENEROUS DISINTERESTED LOVE DID YOU IMAGINE SHE WOULD NOT APPLY THEM
AND AT ONCE BEGINS TO GATHER TO ITSELF FROM THE SURROUNDING SUBSTANCE AND TO BUILD A PLANT FORM IT WILL SO CAUSE INCREASE THAT A SEED HEAD WILL BE PRODUCED CONTAINING THIRTY SIXTY OR A HUNDRED SEEDS
COS IF IT IS JIST YOU STEP IN TO HIM WITH THAT ERE CARD AND SAY MISTER VELLER'S A WAITIN WILL YOU SAID SAM AND SAYING IT HE VERY COOLLY WALKED INTO THE HALL AND SAT DOWN THE POWDERED HEADED FOOTMAN SLAMMED THE DOOR VERY HARD AND SCOWLED VERY GRANDLY
HER ABILITIES WERE QUITE AS EXTRAORDINARY SHE NEVER COULD LEARN OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BEFORE SHE WAS TAUGHT AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN THEN FOR SHE WAS OFTEN INATTENTIVE AND OCCASIONALLY STUPID
MISS WOODLEY JUST THEN ENTERED HER APARTMENT AND SHE FOUND HERSELF SO MUCH A COWARD
AND NOW POYSER AS SATCHELL IS LAID UP I AM INTENDING TO LET THE CHASE FARM TO A RESPECTABLE TENANT I'M TIRED OF HAVING A FARM ON MY OWN HANDS NOTHING IS MADE THE BEST OF IN SUCH CASES AS YOU KNOW
AND IN COMPANY WITH THREE OTHER EXTREMELY RICH MEN HE ARRANGED ONCE A YEAR A FIELD DAY FOR THE TOWN OF INTERVALE
CHAPTER TWENTY ONE FINDING AND LOSING A FORTUNE OUR YOUTHFUL DREAM OF BECOMING FARMERS WAS NOW REALIZED IN FULLEST MEASURE THE CLEARING WAS GRADUALLY ENLARGED AND ABUNDANT CROPS CAME TO REWARD OUR EFFORTS
DO YOU THINK THIS MISTER LANE WOULD ENTERTAIN ME JED PUSHED A HAND UP UNDER HIS TATTERED OLD HAT AND SCRATCHED AWHILE BEFORE HE ANSWERED
THE SHOCK GIVEN TO HER GIRLISH SENSIBILITIES BY HIS IRREVERENT VIEWS OF MARRIAGE TOGETHER WITH THE SURE AND NEAR APPROACH OF THE DAY FIXED FOR COMMITTING HER FUTURE TO HIS KEEPING MADE HER SO RESTLESS
OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY SHE REPEATED THIS ALOUD AS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HAVE SUCH A LONG WORD TO SAY OF ALL THE UNSATISFACTORY PEOPLE
WHILE HE SPOKE TO BARTLE MASSEY ABOUT OLD MISTER DONNITHORNE'S FUNERAL AND OTHER MATTERS OF AN INDIFFERENT KIND BUT AT LENGTH ADAM TURNED ROUND AND SAID IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE
AT HALF PAST NINE RICHARD DEVINE QUITTED HIS MOTHER'S HOUSE TO BEGIN THE NEW LIFE HE HAD CHOSEN AND SO
AND A MAN S NO MAN WHO'LL GROAN OUT LOUD
SYLVIA AND GRACE SPREAD THE LITTLE TABLE BROUGHT CUSHIONS FROM THE WINDOW SEATS AND ADVISED MOLLY AND POLLY TO FORGIVE THE DISTURBANCE WHEN MISSUS FULTON CAME UP STAIRS A LITTLE LATER TO TELL GRACE THAT HER BLACK MAMMY HAD COME TO TAKE HER HOME SHE FOUND THREE VERY HAPPY LITTLE GIRLS
UPON MY SOUL TOM CRIES NIGHTINGALE
BECAUSE GRANDMA SAID I COULD DO AS I PLEASED WITH THE MONEY AND I PLEASE TO PAY IT TO MISTER WAITE
BUT HE COULD NOT TELL THE TWO WORDS APART DON'T YOU SEE BENNY JESS EXPLAINED PATIENTLY THIS ONE WITH THE WIGGLY S SAYS SEE BUT BENNY DID NOT SEE I'LL TELL YOU JESS SAID VIOLET AT LAST LET'S PRINT EACH WORD AGAIN ON A SEPARATE CARD
HE FORESAW ENOUGH HE'D NO RIGHT TO EXPECT ANYTHING BUT HARM AND SHAME TO HER
WE DO NOT GET ON SO FAST AS USUAL AND I AM QUITE TIRED THE BOAT SEEMS VERY HEAVY TODAY IT IS ONLY THE HEAT OF THE WEATHER SAID THE PRINCESS I FEEL IT VERY WARM TOO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAKE STOOD A FINE ILLUMINATED CASTLE
IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR ME TO WRITE AGAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS AS I WILL BE VERY BUSY GETTING SETTLED IN THE HOUSE I MUST GET THINGS ARRANGED JUST AS SOON AS I CAN SO I WILL BE ABLE TO GO OUT ON HORSEBACK WITH FAYE AND LIEUTENANT BALDWIN
AND FULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE POWER THERE IS IN THE LUSTRE OF A RIBBON AND THE INCISIVE GLEAM OF GOLD WHETHER IN BRACELET OR NECKLACE OR IN RINGS FOR THE FINGER OR THE NOSE AND WITH PEDDLERS OF HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS AND WITH DEALERS IN WEARING APPAREL
THINKING OF THE GALLANT WAY IN WHICH THE PONY HAD GALLOPED TO SAVE HIS LIFE
THOUGH I HAVEN'T TIME TO LOOK IT OVER THOROUGHLY JUST NOW
TOTTERING SPIRES NODDED AROUND HIM AND FELL THUNDERING ACROSS HIS PATH AND THOUGH HE HAD REPEATEDLY FACED THESE DANGERS ON THE MOST TERRIFIC GLACIERS AND IN THE WILDEST WEATHER
THE LITTLE FISHES OF THE SEA THEY SENT AN ANSWER BACK TO ME
SHE KNEW SHE MUST HAVE COME A LONG DISTANCE BUT COULD NOT TELL IF IT WAS FIVE MILES OR FIFTY SHE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW BUT THE SCENERY WAS STRANGE TO HER AS SHE SAT THERE SHE REVIEWED WHAT HAD PASSED HER MIND BECOMING CLEARER AS SHE THOUGHT
PAPER STICKS PASTE AND STRING WE'LL MAKE A BIG ONE AND FLY IT AWAY UP IN THE AIR
AND SOME LEATHERN BOTTLES AMONG THE JARS AND BOTTLES ROLLING UPON THE STONY FLOOR REGARDLESS OF THE CROWD AND COLD OFTEN IN DANGER BUT NEVER HURT PLAY HALF A DOZEN HALF NAKED CHILDREN THEIR BROWN BODIES JETTY EYES
UNDER WHICH THE SCRAPE HAD TURNED THE COLOR OF AN UNRIPE BLACKBERRY PREVIOUS TO VANISHING ALTOGETHER WAIT A MOMENT THEN I'LL DAMP IT SAID FITZPIERS HE PUT HIS LIPS TO THE PLACE AND KEPT THEM THERE TILL THE PLASTER CAME OFF EASILY
YES SIR SAID SYLVIA MEEKLY WONDERING WHETHER SHE WOULD EVER DARE TELL HIM HER ERRAND THERE WAS A LITTLE SILENCE AND THEN MISTER WAITE TOOK A SEAT NEAR HIS LITTLE VISITOR AND SAID LET ME SEE
AND IF THE MEETING HAD NO GOOD EFFECT ON HER IT WOULD BE PURE USELESS SUFFERING TO YOU SEVERE SUFFERING I FEAR SHE IS VERY MUCH CHANGED ADAM STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR
HE WILL SAY THAT HE NOW SEES ONE STROKE AND POINT IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH LIES THE IMAGE SEEN THROUGH THE PRISM ANOTHER EXPERIMENT PROVES THAT HE MUST SEE IT IN ORDER TO IGNORE IT MAKE A RED CROSS
WE SHALL FIND THAT OUT TO MORROW SAID THE DOCTOR
AT FIRST THE YOUNG MAN SO RUDELY ASSAILED DID NOT COMPREHEND HIS OWN DANGER HIS MIND BENT UPON ONE HIDEOUS EXPLANATION OF THE CRIME DID NOT SEE ANOTHER OBVIOUS ONE WHICH HAD ALREADY OCCURRED TO THE MIND OF THE LANDLORD OF THE THREE SPANIARDS
AND A GOOD MANY THAT HAVEN'T BEEN INVENTED JUST YET THIS SOUNDED VERY HOPEFUL SO ALICE REPEATED THE FIRST VERSE TWAS BRILLIG
AND HAD HE KNOWN MISSUS CLEAR'S ADDRESS HE WOULD HAVE GONE TO QUESTION HER ABOUT IT BUT ONLY LINK KNEW WHERE THE WOMAN WAS TO BE FOUND AND KEPT THAT INFORMATION TO HIMSELF ESPECIALLY FROM DENZIL NOW THAT HE HAD THE REINS ONCE MORE IN HIS HANDS HE DID NOT INTEND THAT THE BARRISTER SHOULD TAKE THEM AGAIN
I FEEL AS IF I SHALL BE GLAD WHEN IT'S TO MORROW AND WE KNOW THE WORST OR THE BEST MY BOY SAID THE DOCTOR CHEERILY THERE I THINK WE MIGHT START NOW THE MOON HAS SET AND WE HAVE A LONG DARK NIGHT BEFORE US FOR OUR WORK
THEREFORE TO RECTIFY YOUR OPINIONS IN IS THE SCIENCE OF TRADE I'M GLAD SIR SAID HIGGINS WITH A CURIOUS WINK OF HIS EYE THAT YO PUT IN SO THEY THINK
I CONGRATULATE YE IT IS ONLY A MONTH TO DAY TO THE TIME SHE DID NOT ANSWER BUT WITHOUT LIFTING HER DRESS WADED BETWEEN THE DEWY ROWS OF TALL POTATO GREEN INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE PLOT WHERE HE WAS
MISSUS SHIMERDA DROPPED THE ROPE RAN AFTER US AND CROUCHING DOWN BESIDE GRANDFATHER SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND KISSED IT I DOUBT IF HE HAD EVER BEEN SO MUCH EMBARRASSED BEFORE I WAS A LITTLE STARTLED TOO SOMEHOW THAT SEEMED TO BRING THE OLD WORLD VERY CLOSE
IF I LOSE THAT HORSE MISTER BURDEN ANTONIA EXCLAIMED I NEVER STAY HERE TILL AMBROSCH COME HOME I GO DROWN MYSELF IN THE POND BEFORE MORNING
AND WHO SHOWETH NO CONSTANCY IN FRIENDSHIP THE MOUSE REPLIED EVEN SO O MY FRIEND AND I DELIGHT IN THEE AND IN THEY NEIGHBORHOOD BUT WHAT BE THE MOTIVE OF THIS SPEECH
PUNCTUAL TO THE MINUTE LINK IN A STATE OF SUBDUED EXCITEMENT CAME TO LUCIAN'S ROOMS ALREADY HE HAD SENT HIS TWO POLICEMEN OVER TO THE HOUSE INTO WHICH HE HAD INSTRUCTED THEM TO ENTER IN THE QUIETEST AND MOST UNOSTENTATIOUS MANNER
FOR TWENTY YEARS IN COMPANY WITH A SCOUNDREL WHOSE NAME IS A BYWORD FOR ALL THAT IS PROFLIGATE AND BASE YOU HAVE LAUGHED AT ME FOR A CREDULOUS AND HOOD WINKED FOOL AND NOW BECAUSE I DARED TO RAISE MY HAND TO THAT RECKLESS BOY
THE SNOW LAY HIGH OVER THE WHOLE LAND AND EVERY TREE STOOD DEEP IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND DREAMT OF THE SPRING AND WHEN THE SPRING CAME THE GRASS STOOD GREEN AND THE BIRDS BEGAN SINGING WHERE THEY LEFT OFF LAST
FOR THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HIMSELF WAS TO OCCUPY THAT WHICH WAS BETWEEN THEM THIS NIGHTINGALE OF WHOM WE SHALL BE PRESENTLY OBLIGED TO SAY A LITTLE MORE WAS IN THE ORDINARY TRANSACTIONS OF LIFE A MAN OF STRICT HONOUR
SO THAT HIS BARNS BECAME FULL OF CORN AND HIS HOUSE OF TREASURE AND FOR HIM THE RIVER HAD ACCORDING TO THE DWARF'S PROMISE BECOME A RIVER OF GOLD
INTERRUPTED THE LARK HOW AM I TO LEARN FAITH ASKED THE CATERPILLAR AT THAT MOMENT SHE FELT SOMETHING AT HER SIDE SHE LOOKED ROUND EIGHT OR TEN LITTLE GREEN CATERPILLARS WERE MOVING ABOUT
THERE'S NOWHERE ELSE TO GO AND THE HEAD BEN HAD LIFTED UP WITH A DESPERATE SORT OF LOOK WENT DOWN AGAIN ON SANCHO'S BREAST AS IF THERE WERE NO OTHER REFUGE LEFT
HAVE YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF BEING BETROTHED YES OF COURSE YOU MAY BE SURE OF THAT SAID THE HAIR COMB

POSSIBLY WHILE ESCAPING FROM THE PROSPECTIVE MESS KETTLE OF A CONFEDERATE PICKET IN THOSE DAYS CONFEDERATE PICKETS WERE NOT VERY PARTICULAR AS TO THE QUALITY OR KIND OF FOOD AND I HAVE A SUSPICION THAT EVEN A RAZOR BACK WOULD HAVE BEEN A WELCOME ADDITION TO THEIR MEAL
WE MAY CLEM TO SKIN AND BONE AND
AND I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL MASH READY FOR ME SAUSAGE DUMPLING AND APPLE TURNOVER SHOUTED THE BOY WHICH SET THEM ALL LAUGHING I WAS LED INTO A COMFORTABLE CLEAN SMELLING STALL WITH PLENTY OF DRY STRAW
AMBROSCH AND ANTONIA ALWAYS GREETED HIM RESPECTFULLY AND HE ASKED THEM ABOUT THEIR AFFAIRS AND GAVE THEM ADVICE AS USUAL HE THOUGHT THE FUTURE LOOKED HOPEFUL FOR THEM AMBROSCH WAS A FAR SEEING FELLOW HE SOON REALIZED THAT HIS OXEN WERE TOO HEAVY FOR ANY WORK EXCEPT BREAKING SOD

THE YOUNG MAN ON THE POOP CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE TALL FIGURE LEANING AGAINST THE BULWARKS AND IT GAVE HIM AN EXCUSE TO BREAK THE MONOTONY OF HIS EMPLOYMENT
ACCORDING TO THE WAY HE THINKS ABOUT IT SO YOU SEE THAT AN ERRONEOUS PHYSIOLOGY CAN WORK VERY MISCHIEVOUS RESULTS NO SCIENCE OF BEING WELL CAN BE FOUNDED ON CURRENT PHYSIOLOGY IT IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY EXACT IN ITS KNOWLEDGE
BUT THE CHIEF THING AT CYPHER'S WAS MILLY MILLY WAS A WAITRESS SHE WAS A GRAND EXAMPLE OF KRAFT'S THEORY OF THE ARTISTIC ADJUSTMENT OF NATURE SHE BELONGED LARGELY TO WAITING AS MINERVA DID TO THE ART OF SCRAPPING OR VENUS TO THE SCIENCE OF SERIOUS FLIRTATION

AND IF SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AT ALL IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF AT LEAST SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIES

I FELT THAT IT WAS TOO MUCH FOR A MAN TO DO GRIGGS SAID THE DOCTOR QUIETLY SO DID I SIR WAS THE FEEBLE REPLY BUT IT HAD TO BE DONE AND I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE A BETTER FINISH OUT OF THE JOB
I REMEMBER EXACTLY HOW HE STRODE INTO OUR KITCHEN IN HIS FELT BOOTS AND LONG WOLFSKIN COAT HIS EYES AND CHEEKS BRIGHT WITH THE COLD AT SIGHT OF GRANDMOTHER HE SNATCHED OFF HIS FUR CAP GREETING HER IN A DEEP ROLLING VOICE WHICH SEEMED OLDER THAN HE
DID NOT TAKE SHAPE UNTIL MUCH LATER FOR WHEN BOOKS MULTIPLIED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF PRINTING IT BECAME CUSTOMARY TO FIT UP FOR THEIR RECEPTION LITTLE ROOMS CALLED CABINETS IN THE FAMOUS CABINET OF CATHERINE DE MEDICI AT BLOIS

AND SEIZED HIS HAT WHICH LAY ON THE TABLE BUT HE STOOD STILL THEN AND LOOKED AT MISTER IRWINE AS IF HE HAD A QUESTION TO ASK WHICH IT WAS YET DIFFICULT TO UTTER BARTLE MASSEY ROSE QUIETLY TURNED THE KEY IN THE DOOR
SHE REMEMBERED THE SCENE AT THE INQUEST AND REMEMBERED HOW SHE HAD FAINTED AND HOW RAYMOND HAD SUPPORTED HER AND TAKEN HER TO THE NURSE'S HOUSE THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW THE CORONER'S JURY HAD ACCUSED HER OF THE TERRIBLE CRIME AND SHE GAVE A DEEP SHUDDER POOR DEAR FATHER

AND THE BLOODLESSNESS OF THOSE CONVOLUTIONS RELATED TO NATURAL SLEEP BUT WE ARE NOT ALTOGETHER WITHOUT CONTROL OVER THEM WE CAN WE KNOW HELP TO COMPOSE OURSELVES TO SLEEP AS WE SAY IN ORDINARY LANGUAGE
NO NO A GENTLE REASONABLENESS CAME INTO HER TONE AS SHE ADDED IT MUST NOT BE YOU KNOW IT WON'T DO VERY WELL GOOD BY THE NEXT MOMENT HE WAS GONE
