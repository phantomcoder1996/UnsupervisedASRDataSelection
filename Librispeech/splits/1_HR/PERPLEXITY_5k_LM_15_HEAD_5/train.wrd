THE EXPERIENCE WAS OF SOME YEARS AGO IN CHINA
FREE FROM SOCIAL CARES AND INTRUSION BORES WITH SAD STORIES OF UNAPPRECIATED LIVES AND FOND HOPES UNREALIZED NEVER BROKE IN UPON HIS PEACE
MY CURIOSITY IN A SENSE WAS STRONGER THAN MY FEAR FOR I COULD NOT REMAIN WHERE I WAS BUT CREPT BACK TO THE BANK AGAIN WHENCE SHELTERING MY HEAD BEHIND A BUSH OF BROOM I MIGHT COMMAND THE ROAD BEFORE OUR DOOR
MY OWN CHIEF REASON FOR INDIGNATION HERE THAT THIS PREPOSTEROUS EXPLANATION INTERFERES WITH SOME OF MY OWN ENORMITIES IT WOULD COST ME TOO MUCH EXPLAINING IF I SHOULD HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THIS EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE
A WOMAN MAY SUCCEED TO THE THRONE OF ENGLAND WITH THE SAME POWER AND PRIVILEGES AS A KING AND THE BUSINESS OF THE STATE IS TRANSACTED IN HER NAME WHILE HER HUSBAND IS ONLY A SUBJECT THE KING'S WIFE IS CONSIDERED AS A SUBJECT
REGARDING THE WILL THAT IS EXPRESSED IN IT IS NOW ENTIRELY DONE WITH DEAD AND NO LONGER ANYTHING AND THEREFORE IT MUST BE AS A MATTER OF REASON
THEY APPOINTED A CODE OF SECRET PASSWORDS AND COUNTERSIGNS WHICH WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER AND WHICH WERE ONLY USED WHEN THEY MIGHT EXCITE THE CURIOSITY OF THE OTHER AND UNINITIATED BOYS BY THEIR MYSTERIOUS SOUND
BENT OVER AND KISSED THE UNRESPONSIVE LIPS TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND THEN TURNED AWAY AND WENT OUT OF THE HOUSE WITHOUT LOOKING AT ANY OF THE COMPANY THE OLD LADY SAID TO HAWKINS
SHE PUT THE QUESTION VERY FRANKLY TURNING TOWARD ROLLIN IN REAL EARNEST YES CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WITH A GRACEFUL SMILE I AM NOT SO CERTAIN THAT I CAN TELL YOU MUCH
MANY A ONE DURING THE DAYS OF THE REVOLUTION HAS DOUBTLESS PASSED THROUGH A CRISIS AS DIFFICULT AS HERS AT THAT MOMENT AND THE SYMPATHIES OF MORE THAN ONE READER WILL FILL IN ALL THE COLORING OF THE PICTURE
WE ASSUME SOME OF THE MOST PECULIAR AND TEMPORARY OF OUR LATE ADVANTAGES AS NATURAL PERMANENT AND TO BE DEPENDED ON AND WE LAY OUR PLANS ACCORDINGLY ON THIS SANDY AND FALSE FOUNDATION WE SCHEME FOR SOCIAL IMPROVEMENT
AND YOUR CONFIDENCE IN HIS POSSESSION OF THOSE QUALITIES WHICH WILL MAKE HIM AN EXCELLENT LANDLORD WHEN THE TIME SHALL COME FOR HIM TO TAKE THAT IMPORTANT POSITION AMONG YOU
WHEN THE KING RETURNED FROM HIS JOURNEY HE FOUND THE TOWER IN THE FOREST ENTIRELY EMPTY THERE WAS NOTHING BUT THE YAWNING HOLE TO TELL HIM OF HIS DAUGHTER'S ESCAPE HE TRIED IN VAIN TO FIND OUT WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER
SHE LISTENED TO THE ARGUMENTS HE ADVANCED WITH APPARENT COMPOSURE BUT THIS WAS ONLY THE CALM OF A MOMENT THE REMEMBRANCE OF MONTRAVILLE'S RECENT CRUELTY AGAIN RUSHED UPON HER MIND SHE PUSHED HIM FROM HER WITH SOME VIOLENCE AND CRYING
FORKS ON THE STOMACH AND MEETS THE HANDS AFTER PASSING BETWEEN THE LEGS WHILE THEY WERE BINDING JAVERT A MAN STANDING ON THE THRESHOLD WAS SURVEYING HIM WITH SINGULAR ATTENTION
AND FEASTING NOBODY WENT TO BED BUT ALL PASSED THE NIGHT IN PLAYING TRICKS UPON EACH OTHER IN SHORT EVERY THING SUCCEEDED SO WELL THAT THE YOUNGEST DAUGHTER BEGAN TO THINK THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE NOT TO HAVE A BEARD SO VERY BLUE
THIS OFTEN APPLIES TO THEIR VERY ERRORS BUT THEIR GOOD SENSE WOULD DESPISE THE ADULATOR WHO SHOULD PRETEND THAT THEY ALWAYS REASON RIGHT ABOUT THE MEANS OF PROMOTING IT THEY KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THEY SOMETIMES ERR AND THE WONDER IS
MADE THEM DELAY AWHILE YET WHEN THE MISERY OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES BECAME GLARING AN ENTHUSIASTIC GENEROSITY INSPIRED THEIR DECREES
BUT APART FROM THESE DETAILS I NEVER FORGET ANYBODY AND I AM PROUD OF IT BUT WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN THAT A NAME OR FACE ESCAPES ME I NEVER LOSE MY PRESENCE OF MIND
HE OPENED HIS MOTHER'S LETTER AND SLOWLY READ IT THEN PASSED IT TO HIS FRIEND AND RISING WALKED TO THE WINDOW AND STOOD GAZING DOWN INTO THE SQUARE
FOR US UNDOUBTEDLY SIR BRIDGMAN HAD SAID DRILY PERSONALLY I OBJECT TO BEING GINGERED UP LOOK AT POOR BLAIR THERE YOU SEE THE RESULTS OF THE PROCESS
AND KNEW IT WAS NOT FOR AS I SCANNED HER COVERTLY THERE FELL UPON HER FACE THAT SHADOW OF INHUMAN TRANQUILLITY OF UNEARTHLY WITHDRAWAL WHICH I GUESSED HAD MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE MADDENED VENTNOR INTO HIS ATTACK UPON THE DISK I WATCHED HER FIGHT AGAINST IT
THE PRIESTS OF THE STARS WERE DETERMIN'D TO PUNISH HIM AS ALL THE COSTLY JEWELS AND OTHER VALUABLE DECORATIONS IN WHICH EVERY YOUNG WIDOW THAT SACRIFICED HER SELF ON HER HUSBAND'S FUNERAL PILE
CAUGHT BY MEANS OF THEIR OWN CURIOSITY WITH NOTHING BUT A LITTLE DOG FOR A BAIT IN A FEW HOURS AFTERWARD THEY WERE ALL DEAD DUCKS ON THEIR WAY TO THE LONDON MARKET
A GIANT OF A FELLOW ACROSS WHOSE RIGHT CHEEK THERE RAN A THIN SCAR FROM TEMPLE TO MOUTH APPROACHED HIS COMPANION HIS GAZE WAS DIRECTED BEYOND AND ABOVE HIS COMRADE WHEN HE HAD COME QUITE CLOSE HE SPOKE
I WILL OF COURSE I WILL AND HE BEGAN THE PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND HER BUT WHAT WAS THERE TO THINK ABOUT NOTHING THAT SHE HAD SAID ALTERED IN THE LEAST HIS IDEA ABOUT THE MAN
BLESSES THE PRINCESS MEANWHILE THE PRINCESS WHO HAD BEEN CHANGED INTO A DOVE FLEW AFTER HER BROTHERS THE EAGLES BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO OVERTAKE THEM SHE RESTED UNDER A WAYSIDE CROSS AND BEGAN COOING MOURNFULLY
AND THEN HE LAID DOWN HIS COURSE FOR HIMSELF HE LOVED SARA AND HE DID NOT WISH TO CONQUER HIS LOVE EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE IT WERE BETTER TO LOVE HER WHOM HE COULD NEVER WIN THAN TO LOVE AND BE LOVED BY ANY OTHER WOMAN
ON THIS POINT HE WAS UNCERTAIN THIS WAS NATURE'S SECRET IN THE MIDST OF HIS STRESS OF MIND HIS EYES HAD WANDERED OVER HIS BOOKS THEY HAD BEEN CAUGHT BY THE COLOUR OF A SMALL THIN VOLUME
AND MUST NOT AN ANIMAL BE A LOVER OF LEARNING WHO DETERMINES WHAT HE LIKES AND DISLIKES BY THE TEST OF KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCE MOST ASSUREDLY
IN A PURELY CIVIL MATTER THE INFALLIBLE CHURCH FROM ITS INCEPTION HAD DISPLAYED A MARKED HOSTILITY TO LOANS AT INTEREST FROM THE EARLIEST PERIOD
AFTER YOU HAVE PASSED THE MAIN BODY OF THE ANIMAL YOU MAY STILL BE IN DANGER FROM THE TRAILING THREADS WE NOTICED THESE SAME POISON DARTS WHEN WE WERE DEALING WITH THE FLOWER LIKE ANIMALS THE ANEMONES
HE PAINTED PATHETICALLY THE TEMPER INTO WHICH THE LEGISLATURE HAD BEEN WROUGHT THE DISGUST OF THOSE WHO WERE CALLED THE CREDITOR STATES THE DANGER OF THE SECESSION OF THEIR MEMBERS AND THE SEPARATION OF THE STATES HE OBSERVED THAT
I CAN NOT SAY WHETHER SHE KNEW BRANDON WAS THERE OR NOT BUT SHE WAS THERE AND HE WAS THERE WHICH IS THE ONLY THING TO THE POINT AND FINDING HIM SHE STEPPED INTO THE ALCOVE BEFORE HE WAS AWARE OF HER PRESENCE
IT WAS FORTUNATE HE GOT AWAY AT THAT MOMENT FOR SEVERAL OF THE MONKEYS HAD SCRAMBLED UP THE TREE AFTER HIM AND WERE ALMOST NEAR ENOUGH TO SEIZE HIM BY THE LEGS WHEN TO THEIR SURPRISE HE SHOT INTO THE AIR
AND BEGAN GREEDILY AND PERSISTENTLY KISSING HIS DEAD BOY ON THE LIPS AT LAST THEY SUCCEEDED IN PERSUADING HIM TO COME AWAY FROM THE STEP BUT SUDDENLY HE IMPULSIVELY STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND SNATCHED A FEW FLOWERS FROM THE COFFIN
MARGARET SAT AT THE WINDOW
EVEN IN THE MIDST OF MY ADMIRATION OF HER BEAUTY SHE LOOKED AT ME RESENTFULLY SHE DID INDEED CAPTAIN JIM THE RESENTMENT MUST HAVE BEEN ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE MISTRESS BLYTHE AND YOU JEST COME IN FOR A SHARE OF IT BECAUSE YOU HAPPENED PAST
OH IT ISN'T THAT THE PROPRIETOR HASTENED TO ASSURE HIM BUT THESE ARE DIAMONDS OF SUCH A PECULIAR KIND SO PERFECT AND WITHOUT A FLAW THAT I WONDERED FROM WHAT PART OF THE WORLD THEY CAME THEN THEY ARE DIAMONDS
TRIFON BORISSOVITCH CAME DOWN THE STEPS TOO ALL STARED AT MITYA FORGIVE ME AT PARTING GOOD PEOPLE MITYA SHOUTED SUDDENLY FROM THE CART FORGIVE US TOO HE HEARD TWO OR THREE VOICES
HIS RECEPTION WAS GRAVE SILENT AND WARY THE WARRIORS IN FRONT STEPPED ASIDE OPENING THE WAY TO THEIR MOST APPROVED ORATOR BY THE ACTION
SO TRUE IS THIS THAT WHEN A MAN EARNESTLY APPLIES HIMSELF TO REMEDY THE DEFECTS IN HIS CHARACTER AND MAKES SWIFT AND MARKED PROGRESS HE PASSES RAPIDLY THROUGH A SUCCESSION OF VICISSITUDES
WHEN HE MET THE DWARF AND HE ASKED HIM WHERE HE WAS HURRYING TO HE STOPPED AND SAID I AM SEARCHING FOR THE WATER OF LIFE BECAUSE MY FATHER IS DYING DO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS TO BE FOUND NO SAID THE PRINCE
BUT THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO HAPPILY CONCERTED IN THE SYSTEM UNDER CONSIDERATION PROMISE AN EFFECTUAL SECURITY AGAINST THIS MISCHIEF THE CHOICE OF SEVERAL TO FORM AN INTERMEDIATE BODY OF ELECTORS
BUT A WILD INFECTION OF THE WILDLY SHAKEN PUBLIC MIND IN SEASONS OF PESTILENCE SOME OF US WILL HAVE A SECRET ATTRACTION TO THE DISEASE A TERRIBLE PASSING INCLINATION TO DIE OF IT
TO ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN AND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR RESPECTIVELY THE LAST DATE WAS ONE OF GREAT INDUSTRIAL PROSPERITY AND DOUBTLESS MANY EPHEMERAL ENTERPRISES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO EXISTENCE
AND PARIS WAS THE FIRST VICTIM OF THE FATAL ARROWS IN HIS DISTRESS PARIS BETHOUGHT HIM OF ONE WHOM IN HIS PROSPERITY HE HAD FORGOTTEN
IT'S VERY TRUE I DID ENCOURAGE HIM AND THEN SHE ASKED IF HER COMPANION HAD LEARNED FROM MISTER GOODWOOD WHAT HE INTENDED TO DO IT WAS A CONCESSION TO HER CURIOSITY FOR SHE DISLIKED DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT
BY ALLAH O MY BROTHER YESTERDAY WHEN I WAS SITTING UPON THE SEAT OF JUDGEMENT
NO SAID SHE THAT BUBBLE WAS VERY PRETTY AND VERY DEAR TO OUR HEARTS BUT IT HAS BURST LIKE MANY ANOTHER
ALL THE WORLD COULD NOT PERSUADE ME OUT OF THEM ROBERTO AND SEBASTIAN AND HALF A DOZEN MORE OF THEM WENT INTO FITS TO BE SURE THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THAT I SAID MYSELF THERE WAS NO NEED OF THAT
THE PRINCESS OBEYED TO THE UTMOST HER HUSBAND'S INSTRUCTIONS SHE ASSUMED A LOOK OF PLEASURE ON THE NEXT VISIT OF THE MAGICIAN AND ASKED HIM TO AN ENTERTAINMENT WHICH HE MOST WILLINGLY ACCEPTED
AND LAY THERE TWISTING AND WRITHING LIKE A WORM HE HAS ASKED THE QUESTION HOWLED THE SLAVES HE HAS ASKED THE QUESTION ARE YOU MAD CRIED THE YOUNG MAN WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU
I THINK YOU'LL HAVE TO RAISE YOUR OFFER MISTER WALKER HAD SAID TO MISTER WHARTON THAT WAS ALL VERY WELL MISTER WHARTON WAS WILLING ENOUGH TO RAISE HIS OFFER
BUT WHEN ONE TURNS TO CHINA THERE ARE THE STRANGEST POSSIBILITIES
IN FORMER BATTLES HE HAD ONLY CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITIES OF SUCCESS BUT NOW INNUMERABLE UNLUCKY CHANCES PRESENTED THEMSELVES AND HE EXPECTED THEM ALL YES IT WAS LIKE A DREAM IN WHICH A MAN FANCIES THAT A RUFFIAN IS COMING TO ATTACK HIM
WITHOUT MAKING AN UNCHARITABLE SPEECH SO I NEVER MENTION HER AT ALL YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT I'M TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLAN AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHE'S PERFECT
BUT YOU MUSTN'T LET YOUR FOOT GO ASTRAY IN THAT WAY YOU MUSTN'T INDEED SOMEBODY SAID THAT WHATEVER IS IS RIGHT AND I DECLARE I BELIEVE IT I'M SOMETIMES INCLINED TO THINK THAT WHATEVER IS IS WRONG
SHE HELD HIM FOR A MONTH WITHIN HER CHAMBER BUT THIS WAS LESS FROM CHOICE THAN FOR THE CRAFT THAT WAS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN THE INK AND PARCHMENT REQUISITE FOR HER WRITING AT THE END SHE WROTE A LETTER ACCORDING TO HER HEART AND SEALED IT WITH HER RING
NO PAINT NO DECORATIONS NO COLORED WINDOWS NO ORGAN OR ANYTHING WHICH COULD EVEN REMOTELY SUGGEST THE COLOR THE BEAUTY THE FORMALISM OF THE CHURCHES OF ENGLAND
WITHOUT A LITTLE HELP SAID THE POOR LADY RED AND PANTING WITH THE HEAT AND STEEPNESS OF THE ROAD CERTAINLY MA'AM ANSWERED CORNY OBEYING AT ONCE AND INWARDLY RESOLVING TO DEPOSIT HIS FAIR BURDEN
I DARE SAY SHE THOUGHT I WAS SPEAKING OF HER SON CATHERINE WAS DISAPPOINTED AND VEXED SHE SEEMED TO HAVE MISSED BY SO LITTLE THE VERY OBJECT SHE HAD HAD IN VIEW
SHARES WHILE SHE SUBLIMES ITS NATURE SHE PLAYS ROUND THE MOST VULGAR AND RUDE BEINGS GENTLE AND CARESSING YET UNSULLIED
WHEREUPON SHE LIFTED HER FACE TO PERCEIVE THAT IT WAS INDEED RAINING AND THEN GLANCING BACK AT THE PHOTOGRAPH
ISABEL BELIEVED SHE WAS DOUBTING HER SINCERITY AND THE IMPRESSION TOOK FORCE FROM HER SLOWLY GETTING UP FROM HER CUSHION SHE STOOD THERE A MOMENT WITH HER SMALL HANDS UNCLASPED AND THEN QUAVERED OUT WELL I HOPE NO ONE WILL ASK ME
WHICH I HAVE CONTRIVED TO AID THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN THE RAPID MULTIPLICATION OF COLONIES BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS A SOLID BLOCK ABOUT AN INCH AND A QUARTER THICK IS SUBSTITUTED FOR ONE OF MY FRAMES HOLES
I REMEMBER THESE LADIES PARTICULARLY BECAUSE BOTH WERE REMARKABLY GOOD TALKERS
AND I FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CONVINCE HIM OF HIS MISTAKE SO FROM THAT TIME I HAVE CAREFULLY REFRAINED FROM ANY NOTICE OF THE SUBJECT WHATEVER
THAT MAKE THE CIRCUIT OF THE REST AND DEAL OCCASIONAL SMILES TO LIVES THAT STOOP TO NOTICE MINE AND KINDLY ASK IT IN WHOSE INVITATION KNEW YOU NOT FOR WHOM I MUST DECLINE
THERE WEREN'T SO VERY MANY DESIRABLE YOUNG MEN MOST OF THE ENERGETIC ONES WENT OFF TO PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK TRUE THAT JENNIE MC TEVISH HAD BEEN MARRIED AT THIRTY ONE
THE DAY WAS FAR ADVANCED AND THE PRINCE PREPARED TO LEAVE THE MOUNTAIN THE HERMIT HOWEVER TOLD HIM THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SPEND THE EVENING IN THE TEMPLE AND TO BE FURTHER PRAYED FOR HIS ATTENDANTS ALSO SUPPORTED THIS SUGGESTION
SO THE CHOICE WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO BE DIVERTED FROM HIM
I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE SILENCE AND THE DARKNESS TO LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT BEING SEEN THE USHER WHO HAD INTRODUCED ME WAS WAITING FOR ME AT THE DOOR
THE BLOOD SO LONG ACCUMULATING IN THE VESSELS OF MY HEAD AND THROAT AND WHICH HAD HITHERTO BUOYED UP MY SPIRITS WITH MADNESS AND DELIRIUM HAD NOW BEGUN TO RETIRE WITHIN THEIR PROPER CHANNELS
PUDD'NHEAD WILSON'S CALENDAR HABIT IS HABIT AND NOT TO BE FLUNG OUT OF THE WINDOW BY ANY MAN
SHE WAS SURPRISED SOON AFTERWARDS BY THE SIGHT OF SELINA I WOULD NOT LET MISTER IRETON HINDER ME FROM COMING TO YOU THIS ONCE SHE CRIED DO WHAT HE COULD
UPON THE EVENING AT WHICH I AM NOW ARRIVED THE TWENTY SECOND OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN THE WHOLE CITY IN ITS WEALTHIER CLASSES WAS ASSEMBLED BENEATH THE ROOF OF A TRADESMAN WHO HAD THE HEART OF A PRINCE
I VALUE THE WOMANLY SKILL WHICH KEEPS HOME HAPPY MORE THAN WHITE HANDS OR FASHIONABLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS I'M PROUD TO SHAKE THIS GOOD INDUSTRIOUS LITTLE HAND AND HOPE I SHALL NOT SOON BE ASKED TO GIVE IT AWAY
WHERE HIS FATHER EDITED THE ZANESVILLE AURORA AND HE HAD AN UNCLE WHO WAS A SUPERIOR MAN AND EDITED THE WHEELING INTELLIGENCER HIS POEMS SEEM TO BE EXTREMELY POPULAR AND HAVE BEEN HIGHLY PRAISED
YOU MUST PAY THE PENALTY OF BEING A PUBLIC CHARACTER YOUR MARRIAGE IS ANNOUNCED IN THE NEWSPAPERS I SELDOM READ THE NEWSPAPERS AH INDEED

AND I KNEW THAT SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM I WENT INTO THE VILLAGE AND TOLD CONSTABLE QUEENSMEAD HE CAME TO THE INN AND MADE A SEARCH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE AND FOUND THE FOOTPRINTS LEADING TO THE PIT ON THE RISE
AND TELL THEM TO SEND THEIR INSTRUCTIONS TO WELLS
TO WHICH HE WAS CARRYING THE SAME MESSAGE OF PEACE SHE LOOKED OUT FROM BETWEEN THE MUSLIN CURTAINS UNTIL HE HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED TO A DISTANT PART OF THE FIELD AND THEN SHE TURNED TO HER MOTHER AND SAID EAGERLY IT'S A VERY PRETTY PICTURE
THERE WAS MORE EXCITEMENT IN THE AIR OF GREEN GABLES THAN THERE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE IN ALL ITS HISTORY EVEN MARILLA WAS SO EXCITED THAT SHE COULDN'T HELP SHOWING IT WHICH WAS LITTLE SHORT OF BEING PHENOMENAL
THIS ACCOUNT OF HER PARTIAL IGNORANCE IS CONFIRMED BY HER OTHER SCHOOL FELLOWS BUT MISS W WAS A LADY OF REMARKABLE INTELLIGENCE AND OF DELICATE TENDER SYMPATHY

IT WAS CLOSE TO A YEAR AFTER THEIR ADVENT IN PROUTY THAT MISSUS TOOMEY AWAKENED IN THE SMALL HOURS LISTENED A MOMENT THEN PRODDED HER HUSBAND SHARPLY THE WIND'S COMING UP JAP AND I LEFT OUT MY WASHING

LADY USHANT'S LETTER HAD BEEN RECEIVED ON THE THURSDAY AND MISSUS MASTERS AT ONCE FOUND IT EXPEDIENT TO COMMUNICATE WITH LARRY TWENTYMAN SHE WAS NOT EXCELLENT HERSELF AT THE WRITING OF LETTERS AND THEREFORE SHE GOT DOLLY TO BE THE SCRIBE

ANYONE COULD HAVE TOLD HER THAT BY THIS ATTITUDE OF MIND TOWARDS THE FUTURE SHE WAS LAYING UP FOR HERSELF DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE LEAST IF NOT THE BITTEREST DISILLUSIONS BUT THERE WAS NO ONE TO THROW COLD WATER ON HER HOPES
BUT I DON'T WANT TO CHATTER ANY MORE WITH YOU JUST NOW I HAVE HAD TO TROT A MILE ON ACCOUNT OF A CONFOUNDED HUNTER WHO STRUCK ME ON ONE OF MY HIND LEGS WITH AN ARROW NOW I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SLEEP
FOR EVERY MUSKRAT'S SUMMER HOUSE HAS SEVERAL BURROWS LEADING TO IT WHEN THEY REACHED THE OLD NEST AT THE END ALL OF THEM TRIED TO GET IN AT ONCE AND THEY PUSHED EACH OTHER AROUND WITH THEIR BROAD LITTLE HEADS

THEY HAD SOME DIFFICULTY AT FIRST IN CONTRIVING FOR HER TO HOLD HER CARDS AND THEN TO PLAY THEM
AND IN THAT ONE THERE IS THE EIGHTEEN PENCE I TOLD YOU OF HE THEN TURNED UP HIS CLOATHS AND HIS POCKETS ENTIRELY RESEMBLED THE PITCHERS OF THE BELIDES BOOTH WAS A LITTLE STAGGERED AT THIS DEFENCE
AND MY TRANSGRESSIONS AND WHY I HAD NEVER FELT GUILT IN MY SINS I UNDERSTOOD THAT CENTURIES OF CHAINS AND LASHES WILL NOT KILL THE SPIRIT OF MAN NOR THE SENSE OF TRUTH WITHIN HIM
SOMETHING WITH WHICH IS BOUND UP THE RICHNESS AND ZEST OF LIFE NOT ONLY FOR WHAT IT IS THE FASHION OF RADICALS TO CALL THE PRIVILEGED FEW BUT FOR THE GREAT MASS OF MANKIND THAT SOMETHING IS LIBERTY
THIS SAME AUTHOR SAYS THAT THE UNION OF THE TWO SEXES HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN ABOUT TWENTY SPECIES AND HE ASSERTS POSITIVELY THAT THE FEMALE REJECTS SOME OF THE MALES WHO COURT HER THREATENS THEM WITH OPEN MANDIBLES AND AT LAST AFTER LONG HESITATION ACCEPTS THE CHOSEN ONE
AND SHE WAS CONSEQUENTLY RATHER INCLINED TO FANCY HERSELF ILL BUT ALL THE REST OF THE FAMILY WERE IN THE FULL BUSINESS OF THE LONDON SEASON AND MARGARET WAS OFTEN LEFT ALONE THEN HER THOUGHTS WENT BACK TO MILTON
WHICH IS THE TRUE HAPPINESS OF OUR SOULS IS NOT TO BE ACQUIRED BY THE REFLECTIONS OF OUR MINDS OR THE NATURAL EFFORTS OF OUR HEARTS BUT BY THE GRATUITOUS INFUSION OF THE HOLY GHOST

THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PORT OF CALL IN THE PACIFIC
THE EXCITEMENT OF THE WORLD WITH REGARD TO THE NORTH POLE HAD AT THIS DATE REACHED A PITCH WHICH CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS FEVERED THOUGH THAT WORD HARDLY EXPRESSES THE STRANGE ECSTASY AND UNREST WHICH PREVAILED
AND SEVERAL SETS OF THEM IN A YEAR IF MISTER AND MISSUS NIBBLER ARE LIVING IN A HOUSE THEIR NEST IS MADE OF SCRAPS OF PAPER CLOTH WOOL
KITTY SUDDENLY REALIZED HER DISTANCE FROM THE SHORE AND WAS SEIZED WITH IMMEDIATE AND PARALYZING TERROR OH OH SHE GASPED HOW FAR OUT WE ARE WE SHALL NEVER GET BACK IN THE WORLD WE SHALL BE DROWNED

HE ASKS HOLDING OUT HIS SNUFF BOX TO THE WOMEN THE WOMEN TAKE A PINCH OF SNUFF AND SNEEZE THE OLD MAN GOES INTO INDESCRIBABLE ECSTASIES BREAKS INTO LOUD LAUGHTER AND CRIES
IT FOLLOWS THAT THE END WHICH THEY HAVE A TENDENCY TO PROMOTE MUST BE SOME WAY AGREEABLE TO US AND TAKE HOLD OF SOME NATURAL AFFECTION IT MUST PLEASE EITHER FROM CONSIDERATIONS OF SELF INTEREST OR FROM MORE GENEROUS MOTIVES AND REGARDS
AND THE BOY STEPPED IN AND HALTED
AND THEN IF YOU PRESS ME FOR AN OPINION I MUST SAY THAT YOU WERE NOT JUSTIFIABLE IN ASKING MISTER PECK TO TAKE PART IN A SOCIAL ENTERTAINMENT WHEN WE HAD EXPLICITLY DROPPED THAT PART OF THE AFFAIR
THUS THE PALE BLIGHT OF TIME AND SORROW WILL SHADE WITH GREY HER SOFT DARK HAIR THEN COMES THE DAY THAT KNOWS NO MORROW AND DEATH SUCCEEDS TO LONG DESPAIR

WHAT'S THE USE OF HAVING A PARTY AT ALL SHE SAID TO HERSELF I'D LIKE TO HAVE IT AS NICE AS HERS BUT WHATEVER I HAVE I HAVE GOT TO DO IT ALL MYSELF I'M NOT AS STRONG AS MILLY I KNOW
HE WOULD TURN OVER AND CONTINUE TO SLEEP AND I I DO NOT SLEEP I CONTINUED PACING UP AND DOWN THE STREET I DO NOT SLEEP I
I KNEW THE TRUTH HE WAS DEAD HIS AGE WAS NOT MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE HE HAD GREY EYES FAIR HAIR AND BEARD
HE DILATED ON HER INDIFFERENCE SINCE THEY HAD PARTED HER SILENCE SO STRANGE NOW NO LONGER INEXPLICABLE THE TOTAL WANT OF INTEREST SHE HAD EXHIBITED AS TO HIS CAREER HE SNEERED AT THE LIGHTNESS OF HER TEMPERAMENT
ALMA ANSWERED THAT LETTER SHE TOLD HERSELF RECKLESSLY THAT SHE WOULD KEEP ON WRITING TO HIM UNTIL HE FOUND OUT SHE WOULD LOSE HIS FRIENDSHIP ANYHOW WHEN THAT OCCURRED BUT MEANWHILE SHE WOULD HAVE THE LETTERS A LITTLE LONGER
WHAT MAKES A MAN A GOOD MAN PRACTICE NOTHING ELSE THERE IS NOTHING CAPRICIOUS ABOUT RELIGION WE DO NOT GET THE SOUL IN DIFFERENT WAYS UNDER DIFFERENT LAWS
BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE REASONED AND DECIDED JUDICIOUSLY AND HAPPY THEY ARE IN REFLECTING THAT THEY DID SO THEY CONSIDERED THAT THE CONGRESS WAS COMPOSED OF MANY WISE AND EXPERIENCED MEN THAT
INSTEAD OF THE LOFTY OCCUPATION THAT SEEMS TO HIM TO BE ENGAGING HIS POWERS HE MAY REALLY BE BEATING HIS HANDS AGAINST THE WINDOW BARS OF AN ASYLUM AND DECLARING HIMSELF NOAH WEBSTER TO THE INNOCENT DELIGHT OF MANY THOUGHTLESS SPECTATORS
THEY CONTINUE TO PATRONIZE YOU AND RECOMMEND YOU TO THEIR FRIENDS AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF HIS CAREER DOCTOR BRANDRETH WAS INDEBTED TO MISTER MOSES Y BEACH PROPRIETOR OF THE NEW YORK SUN FOR ENCOURAGEMENT AND MEANS OF ADVERTISING

THIS HOWEVER WAS ATTENDED TO BY THE YOUNGER OFFICERS WHO AT ONCE SET ABOUT ARRANGING THE CONDITIONS OF THE DUEL THERE WAS NOT MUCH TIME CONSUMED THE TERMS HAD BEEN EXPRESSED ALREADY
AND WHENEVER I AM CONSCIOUS OF NOT PRACTICING WHAT I PREACH I AM BITTERLY ASHAMED AND GRIEVED HOW MUCH WORK BADLY DONE I AM NOW HAVING TO UNDO IF I HAD BEGUN IN EARNEST TO SERVE GOD WHEN I WAS AS YOUNG AS THESE CHILDREN ARE
BUT ASSISTED BY THE BEAUTY THEY MADE MAGGIE MORE UNLIKE OTHER WOMEN
IT WAS HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO BUY AND ALL SHE COULD THINK OF WAS CAKE

IF AUNT KATE HAD REALLY GOT HER GREAT SCAR THERE AND IF IT WAS REALLY TRUE THAT TWO MEMBERS OF HER UNCLE'S FAMILY HAD MET THEIR DEATH IN THE CONFLAGRATION SHE TRIED NOT TO THINK AT ALL OF INJUN PETE
OF INVADING THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT OF CHURCH AND STATE IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT THEIR PROCEEDINGS IN SUCH A VIOLENT ATTEMPT WOULD THENCEFORTH BE ALTOGETHER REGULAR AND EQUITABLE BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT
SHE WAS A SWEETLY SOCIAL GENIAL LITTLE HUMAN BEING WHOSE PRESENCE IN THE HOUSE WAS EVER FELT TO BE LIKE SUNSHINE SHE WAS NEVER FORWARD BUT NEVER BASHFUL SHE WAS ALWAYS OPEN TO FAMILIAR INTERCOURSE WITHOUT EVER PUTTING HERSELF FORWARD
LOOKED AT HIM WITH WIDE AWAKE BLUE EYES DARK BROWN HAIR AND HAPPY SMILING LIPS SURROUNDED BY SO MUCH SPLENDOR THE MARIONETTE HARDLY KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING HE RUBBED HIS EYES TWO OR THREE TIMES WONDERING IF HE WERE STILL ASLEEP
IN HER PERPLEXITY SHE BESOUGHT MISSUS BERGWALD'S ADVICE NOW MISSUS BERGWALD WAS A NATIVE OF STOCKHOLM A LADY OF RARE CULTURE AND USED THE FRENCH LANGUAGE IN CONVERSING WITH GRANDMA
THE COUNTRY IS DISTRACTED BY MERE STRUGGLES FOR PLACE IF STRONG IT MAKES ITSELF DESPOTIC AT THE CHEAP PRICE OF APPEASING THE REPRESENTATIVES OR SUCH OF THEM AS ARE CAPABLE OF GIVING TROUBLE BY A SHARE OF THE SPOIL
A DEDICATION TO MEDORA TOWNSEND PHILLIPS OF COURSE SAID COPE TO HIMSELF AND AS THE READING WENT ON HE RAN HIS EYES OVER THE DUSKY DARKENING WALLS HE KNEW WHAT HE EXPECTED TO FIND
LOOK BACK WITH SERENE HAPPINESS ON THEIR FAILURES THE TURNING OF THE FACE OF TIME SHOWS ALL THINGS IN A WONDROUSLY ILLUMINATED AND SATISFYING PERSPECTIVE MANY A MAN IS THANKFUL TO DAY THAT SOME PETTY SUCCESS FOR WHICH HE ONCE STRUGGLED
YET IT WAS NOT I WHO HAD BEEN SHOT SHE ADDED SOFTLY MISTER CHALLONER SHUDDERED THIS WAS LIKE THE REOPENING OF HIS DAUGHTER'S GRAVE
WHICH WAS VERY DIGNIFIED AND HAVING SCRUTINISED THAT GENTLEMAN AND HIS COMPANIONS TO HIS ENTIRE SATISFACTION HUMMED A TUNE
THE WALKING STICKS LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND THE BROTHER AND SISTER COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY IT WAS THE YOUNG GREEN ONE WHO SPOKE AT LAST
AND FITFULLY THESE SEEM TO TURN BUT BEHIND THEM EVER BLOWS THE GREAT WIND OF MY PURPOSE NAY THE MEN MUST DIE AND DIE AS I HAVE SAID THEN SUDDENLY TURNING TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD

OF THE FACT AND EVIDENCE OF THE SUPERNATURAL I WILL SPEAK AFTERWARDS HERE WE ARE ONLY CONCERNED WITH THIS CLEAR POINT
I'M SURE SIR SAID MISSUS MITCHELL PUTTING HER BLUE STRIPED APRON TO HER EYES I ASKED YOUR OPINION BEFORE I TOOK HIM I BELIEVE I DID SAY SOMETHING ABOUT ITS BEING TIME HE WERE ABLE TO READ
TOLD ME SO HE IS ONE OF THE BEARGARDEN SET AND OF COURSE HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT IT DID HE SAY HOW MUCH HOW IS HE TO PAY ANYTHING OF ALL THINGS THAT MEN DO THIS IS THE WORST A MAN WHO WOULD THINK HIMSELF DISGRACED
IT WAS VERY FOOLISH OF ME AND I BEG YOUR PARDON SIR WELL TURKEY I CONFESS YOU HAVE VEXED ME NOT BY TRYING TO FIND OUT THE WRONG SHE WAS DOING ME AND THE WHOLE PARISH BUT BY TAKING THE WHOLE THING INTO YOUR OWN HANDS
SAID GEORGIANA WILL YOU GRANT ME ONE FAVOUR OR RATHER MAKE ME A PROMISE I CAN'T TELL MY DEAR TILL I KNOW WHAT IT IS REPLIED MISTER PECK IF IT IS A REASONABLE REQUEST I WILL COMPLY WITH YOUR WISH CONTINUED HE I HOPE MY DEAR ANSWERED SHE

A PERSON ENGAGED IN REIGNING FORMERLY THE MONARCH RULED AS THE DERIVATION OF THE WORD ATTESTS AND AS MANY SUBJECTS HAVE HAD OCCASION TO LEARN IN RUSSIA AND THE ORIENT THE MONARCH HAS STILL A CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS
HE TRIED EVERY SHOUT AND EVERY SOUND AGAINST THIS WALL AT TIMES HE WAITED AND LISTENED BUT THE HOUSE REMAINED MUTE AND DEAD THEN EXASPERATED
THE FIGHT WE MUST WIN IS TO BRING ABOUT AN HONEST AND REASONABLE ADJUSTMENT OLAF AND THAT FIGHT WILL TAKE PLACE RIGHT HERE IN ALASKA AND NOT IN SIBERIA AND IF WE DON'T WIN HE RAISED HIS EYES FROM THE FIRE
IT WOULD BE EVEN WORSE THAN THE TIME I HAD TO CONFESS ABOUT JUMPING ON THE SPARE ROOM BED BOTH GIRLS LAUGHED OVER THE OLD MEMORY CONCERNING WHICH IF ANY OF MY READERS ARE IGNORANT AND CURIOUS I MUST REFER THEM TO ANNE'S EARLIER HISTORY
PERHAPS YOUR LOSS IS NOT SO GREAT AS YOU HAVE THOUGHT HAFELA TAKE YOU THE HAND OF HOKOSA AND RELEASE THE GIRL BACK TO HIM ACCORDING TO THE LAW PROMISING IN THE EARS OF MEN BEFORE THE FIRST MONTH OF WINTER
HE SEEMED TO FANCY HOWEVER THAT WITH THE POOR HIS WORK ENDED AND HE WAS NOT ALWAYS SO WISE AS HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN MUDDLETON SOCIETY GOOD AFTERNOON MISS HOUGHTON HE EXCLAIMED
BUT THE THIRD TIME HE PERCEIVED A LITTLE FLY STEALING DOWN ONE CHEEK CAUSING IT TO BLUSH A FAINT PINK THEN THE PRINCE SEIZED THE GIRL'S HAND AND CRIED OUT THIS IS THE PRINCESS HYACINTHIA
BUT THEY WERE ASTONISHED AT THIS WONDERFUL EFFECT AND AS IT WERE QUENCHED THEIR THIRST BY THE VERY SIGHT OF IT SO THEY DRANK THIS PLEASANT THIS SWEET WATER AND SUCH IT SEEMED TO BE AS MIGHT WELL BE EXPECTED WHERE GOD WAS THE DONOR
ESPECIAL ATTENTION HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO THIS BIRD BY HERODOTUS
AND AFTER THAT HOW MANY A MAN SHOULD NEVER SEE THE SUN AGAIN AND AMONG THEM WOULD BE MY FATHER HE FOR THE MOMENT RESTING THERE WITH HEAVY LIGHT UPON HIM
TO GET WHAT INFORMATION HE COULD FROM BRAND WHITLOCK THE AMERICAN MINISTER IN BELGIUM HE WENT AT ONCE TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES BUT THEY EVADED HIS QUESTIONS AND WAITED TEN DAYS BEFORE GIVING HIM A REPLY THEN THE GERMANS SENT HIM A STATEMENT
ONE OF THEM WEPT AS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE BEFORE SETTING OUT THEY EMBRACED THOSE WHO REMAINED WHEN THE FIVE MEN SENT BACK TO LIFE HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE
EVEN THE OLD MAN WOULD NOT BE A BLOT UPON MY PRETTY HOME AND HAS BROUGHT HIMSELF INTO LINE WITH ALL MY IMPROVEMENTS TO PLEASE ME HE HAS ADOPTED THE DRESS AND WITH THE DRESS THE MANNERS OF THE DAY WE HAVE ENGLISH HORSES
UPON SUCH INTELLIGENCE THE GENERAL HAD PROCEEDED FOR NEVER HAD IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO DOUBT ITS AUTHORITY THORPE'S INTEREST IN THE FAMILY BY HIS SISTER'S APPROACHING CONNECTION WITH ONE OF ITS MEMBERS
BUT I BY BACKWARD STEPS WOULD MOVE AND WHEN THIS DUST FALLS TO THE URN IN THAT STATE I CAME RETURN H VAUGHAN
SO HE GOT AN AXE AND CUT WINDOWS IN THE COTTAGE FOR THE CARPENTERS HAD FORGOTTEN THEM THEN THE SUN SHONE IN AND HE GOT HIS THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT WAS ONE OF THEM SAID THE MAN TO HIMSELF AS HE WENT ON HIS WAY AFTER A WHILE HE PASSED BY A HOUSE
THIS DIVISION OF THE COUNTRY AS IT HAS BEEN WELL EXPRESSED INTO THE HUNTERS AND THE HUNTED THIS SOWING OF DRAGONS TEETH IN THE SHAPE OF LAWLESSNESS AND CONTEMPT FOR LAW
BUT ANNA HAD AS YET GIVEN NO SIGN OF SUCH REPENTANCE ALTHOUGH ALMA LOOKED FOR IT ANXIOUSLY ANNA WAS HAVING THE TIME OF HER LIFE SHE WAS THE ACKNOWLEDGED BEAUTY OF FIVE SETTLEMENTS AND SHE WENT FORWARD ON HER CAREER OF CONQUEST
HE WILL BRING A THOUSAND DOLLARS ANY DAY IN THE NEW ORLEANS MARKET REPLIED SMITH THEN YOU BET THE WHOLE OF THE BOY DO YOU YES I CALL YOU THEN SAID JOHNSON AT THE SAME TIME SPREADING HIS CARDS OUT UPON THE TABLE
THE SINGING MOUSE BALANCED AND MOVED ITSELF IN HARMONY WITH THE BEAT OF THE FIRE'S RAYS I LOOKED AT IT SO CLOSELY THAT A DREAM CAME UPON MY EYES SO THAT THE VOICE OF THE SINGING MOUSE SOUNDED FAR AWAY AND FAINT
SECONDLY WHEN A THING IS MADE UP OF PARTICLES WHICH DID ALL OF THEM BEFORE EXIST BUT THAT VERY THING SO CONSTITUTED OF PRE EXISTING PARTICLES WHICH CONSIDERED ALL TOGETHER MAKE UP SUCH A COLLECTION OF SIMPLE IDEAS
ARRIVED AT THE FINEST DWELLING IN THE TOWN THEY ENTERED IT AND WERE AT HOME WASHINGTON WAS INTRODUCED TO MISSUS BOSWELL AND HIS IMAGINATION WAS ON THE POINT OF FLITTING INTO THE VAPORY REALMS OF SPECULATION AGAIN
THIS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD TO APPLY TO THE TWO CLASSES OF PLANTS OF THE HARDY KINDS AS COMMONLY GROWN IN GARDENS THERE ARE TENDER KINDS OF THE EAST INDIAN FAMILIES THAT ARE QUITE HARMONIOUS
SIR SAID SHE THE LANGUAGE WHICH I SPEAK WITH MY GRANDFATHER MAY BE EASILY LEARNT AND I CAN TEACH YOU IN A FEW MINUTES TO UNDERSTAND IT ALMOST AS WELL AS I CAN MYSELF
SHE HAD A THIN AWKWARD FIGURE
TO AGITATE FOR A SIMILAR LAW IN THIS COUNTRY THE ASSOCIATION OR ALLIANCE AS IT TERMS ITSELF WHICH HAS BEEN FORMED FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS ACQUIRED SOME NOTORIETY
THAT I MAY BE CONVINCED THAT THERE IS A GOD
OR ELSE A RECOGNITION OF THE RESULT OF A PRIOR JUDGMENT AS IN THE CASE OF FAMILIAR OBJECTS WORDS THE COUNTERS FOR IDEALS ARE HOWEVER EASILY TAKEN FOR IDEAS
AND THIS ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT THAT IMAGES AND SENSATIONS CANNOT ALWAYS BE DISTINGUISHED BY THEIR INTRINSIC NATURE IMAGES ALSO DIFFER FROM SENSATIONS AS REGARDS THEIR EFFECTS SENSATIONS AS A RULE HAVE BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EFFECTS
CHAPTER FIVE THE TORRENT SWEEPING UNDER THE MOUNTAINS THE BOAT DRIFTED ON THE LIGHT GIVEN BY THE AURORA AND THE LOW MOON SEEMED TO GROW FAINTER
AND SO YOU ARE STILL WHEN YOU WON'T TAKE YOUR OWN SON IN WHAT YOU MY SON SAID THE MAN DON'T YOU KNOW ME AGAIN SAID THE YOUTH WELL AFTER A LITTLE WHILE HE DID KNOW HIM AGAIN BUT WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN TURNING YOUR HAND TO
NAY THOUGH THEY WERE MADE OF GOLD AND SILVER THEMSELVES BUT HE WILL REJECT THEM AND ESTEEM THEM INSTANCES OF WICKEDNESS AND NOT OF PIETY AND THAT HE IS DELIGHTED WITH THOSE THAT STILL BEAR IN MIND THIS ONE THING AND THIS ONLY
WHILE VINDICATING HIMSELF TO SAY NOTHING UNKIND OF THE OTHERS BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE AMONGST THEM WHOSE CONDUCT HE COULD MENTION WITHOUT SOME NECESSITY OF DEFENCE OR PALLIATION WE HAVE ALL BEEN MORE OR LESS TO BLAME SAID HE
IT WAS THE REFLECTION OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS BURNING IN THE CORINTHE BARRICADE MARIUS DIRECTED HIS STEPS TOWARDS THAT RED LIGHT
MORE THAN HALF OF MY WORK AS GOVERNOR WAS IN THE DIRECTION OF GETTING NEEDED AND IMPORTANT LEGISLATION I ACCOMPLISHED THIS ONLY BY AROUSING THE PEOPLE AND RIVETING THEIR ATTENTION ON WHAT WAS DONE GRADUALLY
IN THE EXACT RATIO OF THE INFLUENCE EXERCISED BY THE EXECUTIVE POWER
TO MULTIPLY EVERY COMBATANT BY THE POSSIBILITIES WHICH THAT OBSCURITY CONTAINS AT DUSK EVERY WINDOW WHERE A CANDLE WAS BURNING RECEIVED A SHOT THE LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED SOMETIMES THE INHABITANT WAS KILLED HENCE
FOR THE SCULPTOR LOSES NEARLY AS MUCH BY NEVER HAVING ROOM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CONTINUOUS WORK AS YOU DO FROM HAVING REDUCED YOUR WORK TO A CONTINUITY OF MECHANISM YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY AND SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE SAME BODY OF MEN
HE WAS MORE PARTICULAR THAN USUAL THAT HIS ORDERS IN THE SMALLEST ITEM WERE STRICTLY OBSERVED AND THUS WITH HIS IRON WILL AND STRONG INTELLIGENCE HE MASTERED EVERY CONTINGENCY OF THE HOUR IMPARTING THAT INDISPENSABLE CONFIDENCE AMONG HIS PEOPLE
AND HAD SEEN ONLY A FEW OF ITS ROOMS THE NETTING BOX JUST LEISURELY DRAWN FORTH WAS CLOSED WITH JOYFUL HASTE AND SHE WAS READY TO ATTEND HIM IN A MOMENT
I AM ALWAYS DISPLEASED WHEN YOU DISOBEY ME ELSIE HE REPLIED VERY GRAVELY LAYING HIS OTHER HAND ON HER HEAD I AM VERY SORRY I WAS NAUGHTY PAPA SHE SAID HUMBLY AND CASTING DOWN HER EYES
NOW THEN I WANT TO JOIN FATHER
UNTIL SHE WAS SO FAT THAT SHE COULD NOT RUN AWAY AT THE CROCODILE'S APPROACH SHE COULD ONLY STAND AND SQUAWK FEEBLY FLUTTERING HER RIDICULOUS WINGS BUT THE CROCODILE ONLY SAID
IF SHE IS SO CLEVER AS YOU DESCRIBE HER SHE SHALL PERFORM BETWEEN THE ACTS THE STRANGER DECLARED HER UTTER INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH SUCH A REQUEST WHEN I BELIEVED MYSELF UNHEARD SHE CRIED
NOW I WAS GOING TO DIE I HEARD A SORT OF CONFUSION ROUND ME LOUD ANGRY VOICES AND THE GETTING DOWN OF THE LUGGAGE BUT IT WAS ALL LIKE A DREAM I THOUGHT I HEARD THAT SWEET PITIFUL VOICE SAYING
AYE AYE SAID SAINT GEORGE AND SO IT SHOULD END
TO A MAN REVIEW
AND LIVES AND WORKS WHAT ARE THEY ALL AT LAST EXCEPT THE ROADS TO FAITH AND DEATH WHILE WE REHEARSE OUR MEASURELESS WEALTH
HE HAD NOT BEEN VIOLENT AND YET THERE HAD BEEN A VIOLENCE IN THE IMPRESSION THERE HAD BEEN A VIOLENCE AT ANY RATE IN SOMETHING SOMEWHERE PERHAPS IT WAS ONLY IN HER OWN FIT OF WEEPING
FULL OF ARMED MEN AND STORES WEAPONS AND HOARDS THEY MADE SURE THAT THESE WERE ENEMIES COME TO BATTLE WITH THEM
NEXT MORNING SHE ROSE FEELING QUITE CHEERFUL AND FREE FROM CARE BUT WHEN SHE LOOKED ACROSS TOWARDS THE STABLES THERE STOOD THE TAILOR IN FRONT OF THE DOOR LOOKING AS FRESH AND LIVELY AS A FISH IN THE WATER
AND THE ROBINSONS HAD PILED INTO THEIR CAR AND STARTED AWAY WITH GRUDGING THANKS FOR THE EFFORTS IN THEIR BEHALF LESLIE SAT ON THE TERRACE MUSINGLY AND AT LAST QUITE SHYLY SHE SAID CLOUDY DEAR WHAT MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE
WHO THOUGHT THEM TWO OR THREE TIMES STRONGER THAN THEY REALLY WERE RECKLESSLY DEFIANT THOUGH THEY WERE HOWEVER THEY DID PROVIDE THE BREACHING BATTERIES WITH ENOUGH COVER FOR THE PURPOSE IN HAND THIS IS AMPLY PROVED BOTH BY THE FEWNESS OF THEIR CASUALTIES
WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A LIGHTHOUSE KEEPER NAMED WILLIAM DARLING WHO TENDED A LIGHT ON ONE OF THE FARNE ISLANDS AS HIS FATHER HAD DONE BEFORE HIM GRACE WHO WAS THE SEVENTH OF NINE CHILDREN
THEY SIMPLY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT AND FINALLY WENT ACROSS AND SEARCHED THE MOUNTAINS FOR THREE DAYS TRYING TO FIND HIS BODY FAILING TO FIND THE BODY
THE WARRIORS JUST ARRIVED WERE THE MOST DISTANT FIGURES A LITTLE IN ADVANCE STOOD TWO MEN WHO WERE APPARENTLY SELECTED FROM THE REST AS THE PRINCIPAL ACTORS IN WHAT WAS TO FOLLOW
SAID THE SQUIRE HERE'S TO A BETTER ACQUAINTANCE WITH YOU OFFERING ME HIS HAND HOW GOES IT UNCLE ARCHY SAID I TAKING HIS HAND WARMLY FOR I AM ALWAYS FREE AND EASY WITH THOSE WHO ARE SO WITH ME
BUT I BELIEVED THAT THEY KNEW BETTER THAN I DID AND PREPARED TO GO I PULLED OUT MY PURSE BUT TO MY DISMAY THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT THE WOMAN WITH A SMILE BEGGED ME NOT TO TROUBLE MYSELF FOR MONEY WAS NOT OF THE SLIGHTEST USE THERE
I MUST VISIT HIM HE SAID AND OBTAIN SOME PIOUS GRANT FROM HIM OH YOU MAY MAKE SURE OF HIM HIS CHARITIES ALONE AMOUNT TO TWENTY THOUSAND FRANCS A MONTH IT IS MAGNIFICENT
TRY WHAT YOU CAN DO AND LET ME SEE THE ENVIOUS NEIGHBOR WITH THE DAIMIO AND HIS COURT FOLLOWING THEN WENT INTO THE GARDEN AND APPROACHING A DEAD TREE TOOK OUT A HANDFUL OF THE ASHES WHICH HE CARRIED WITH HIM
WHEN THEY BEGIN TO ACT THE DISAGREEABLE RESULTS THEY IGNORED BEGIN TO SHOW THEMSELVES
BUT ABOVE THE CONSIDERATION OF WHAT WAS RIGHT YET WAS HE FAVORED BY FORTUNE AS MUCH AS ANY MAN EVER WAS FOR FROM A PRIVATE MAN HE BECAME A KING AND THOUGH HE WERE ENCOMPASSED WITH TEN THOUSAND DANGERS
OR WHATEVER THEY MAY BE IN LEGAL COURT SUITS THESE ARE ALL YAWNING FOR NO CRUMB OF AMUSEMENT EVER FALLS FROM JARNDYCE AND JARNDYCE THE CAUSE IN HAND
BUT TO THIS DAY THE REPRESENTATIVE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES STILL MAKE MARRIAGE INTO A MYSTICAL SACRAMENT AND WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS THE ROMAN COMMUNION EXACTS THE SACRIFICE OF CELIBACY FROM ITS PRIESTHOOD
AND EVEN HIS OWN FAMILY BY REJECTING ALL THEIR GODS ALONE AND WITHOUT HELP HE RESISTED A POWERFUL TRIBE A TASK WHICH IS NEITHER SIMPLE NOR EASY IT IS AS IF IN THIS DAY SOMEONE WERE TO GO TO A CHRISTIAN PEOPLE
THE NIGHTS ARE TOO HOT WHY
TILL WE CAME TO OUR HORSES THEN WE ALL RODE OFF TOGETHER
PROMISE ME TWO THINGS
SO AS TO ENABLE FIREMEN TO CARRY ON THEIR OPERATIONS WITH SAFETY HIS EXPERIMENT IS STATED TO HAVE GIVEN SATISFACTION THE POMPIERS WERE CLOTHED IN ASBESTOS OVER WHICH WAS A NETWORK OF IRON
DIRECTLY THE SULTAN WAS UP HE SUMMONED HIS LORDS AND NOBLES INTO HIS GREAT HALL AND COMMANDED THAT THE CORDS WHICH BOUND VIRGILIUS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF AND THE PRISONER BROUGHT BEFORE HIM THE MOMENT HE APPEARED
WHETHER HE HAD A WIFE OR ONLY A WILD VIXEN IN HIS HOUSE BUT YET HE WAS COMFORTED THAT SHE BORE AT ALL WITH HIM THOUGH SO RESTLESSLY THAT HE DID NOT SPARE HER CALLING HER A BAD WILD FOX AND THEN SPEAKING TO HER IN THIS MANNER
I WISH THE BOTTOM OF THIS FORTRESS WAS SOLID ROCK JIM DON'T KNOW NOBODY IN CHINA WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH IT
WE OPENED SUFFRAGE HEADQUARTERS IN THE PALACE OF EDUCATION ON THE EXPOSITION GROUNDS FROM THERE WE CALLED THE FIRST WOMAN VOTERS CONVENTION EVER HELD IN THE WORLD FOR THE SINGLE PURPOSE OF ATTACHING POLITICAL STRENGTH TO THE MOVEMENT
PUT IT IN MY POCKET MOTHER THAT WAS VERY STUPID YOU SHOULD HAVE LED IT BY A ROPE NEVER MIND MOTHER I'LL MANAGE BETTER NEXT TIME WHERE ARE YOU GOING HANS
IN SUCH WORDS HE TALKED TO HER BECAUSE HIS MEMORY WAS VERY FULL OF THE COUNTRY OF HIS CHILDHOOD HIS HEART OF HIS LIFE WITH THAT GIRL
AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY FOR HE HAD IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO POOR MASTER MEADOW MOUSE RAN AFTER HIM IT WAS HARD TO FOLLOW HIS COUSIN THROUGH THE WINDING GALLERIES BENEATH THE SNOW
HAD SPAWNED AND THE EGGS HAD DROPPED AND ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO SOME TUFTS OF GRASS AT THE EDGE OF THE LAKE THE VERY NEXT DAY HOWEVER LITTLE FISH HAD BEGUN TO GATHER ABOUT THOSE TUFTS ONE DAY MORE AND THERE WERE SWARMS OF THEM
IT HAD BEEN NOTHING IN ITSELF NOW THE BATTLE WOULD BEGIN IN EARNEST NONE OF THIS WAS CONSCIOUS IN HIS MIND HIS FIGHTER'S REFLEXES BENT HIS SHOULDERS CURVED HIS HANDS BEFORE HIM AS HE WALKED SOFTLY IN BALANCE
PLACING A PAN OF BURNING TEZEK BENEATH A LOW TABLE THE WHOLE FAMILY HUDDLE AROUND IT COVERING THE TABLE AND THEMSELVES SAVE OF COURSE THEIR HEADS UP WITH QUILTS FACING EACH OTHER IN THIS RIDICULOUS MANNER
WHICH INCLUDED THE DAUGHTERS OF MECHANICS CURATES SURGEONS SHOPKEEPERS FARMERS DAIRY MEN SOLDIERS SAILORS AND VILLAGERS THEY SAT IN THE LARGE SCHOOL ROOM OF THE ESTABLISHMENT ON THE EVENING PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED
THE ISLAND BEING SOMETIMES DRIVEN UP AS FAR AS THE NORTH POLE
AT THEIR INSTIGATION AN INQUIRY WAS MADE OF ALL THE TEACHERS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS TO THE STANDING OF MY ART PUPILS IN THEIR OTHER CLASSES IT BEING CONFIDENTLY ANTICIPATED THAT THEY WOULD BE FOUND TO HAVE FALLEN BEHIND
AT THE SAME TIME ADVANCING TOWARDS ANDREA AND SLIPPING A PACKET OF BANK NOTES INTO THE YOUNG MAN'S HAND WHAT IS THIS IT IS FROM YOUR FATHER FROM MY FATHER YES DID YOU NOT TELL HIM JUST NOW THAT YOU WANTED MONEY WELL THEN
MANY MEN IN THE HOMES OF THE SCHOLARS HAVE HAD STRANGE NEW IDEAS IN THE PAST
TWO OR THREE HOURS OF PURSUIT ON THE DAY OF BATTLE WITHOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT THE MEN CARRIED ON THEIR PERSONS WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH MORE THAN ANY PURSUIT COMMENCED THE NEXT DAY COULD HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN
BUT AS I GROW OLD THE HALF LIGHTS OF EVENING ARE FAR MORE TO ME THE PLAY OF IMAGINATION WITH THE SENSUOUS OBJECTS OF NATURE FOR SYMBOLS AND FAITH
WHISPERINGS AT A DISTANCE CORRESPONDENCE GOING ON BETWEEN DARKNESS AND DARKNESS LIKE ONE DEEP CALLING TO ANOTHER AND THE DREAMER'S OWN HEART THE CENTER FROM WHICH THE WHOLE NETWORK OF THIS UNIMAGINABLE CHAOS RADIATES
AND MOTHER LOOKING LOVELY IN HER GREY EVENING DRESS THAT CHANGES INTO PINK AND GREEN WHEN SHE MOVES ROBERT PRETENDED THAT HE WAS TOO COLD TO TAKE OFF HIS GREAT COAT
AND THIS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT THAT UNCLE JOHN HAD AT THAT INTERESTING JUNCTURE APPEARED TO TAKE CHARGE OF THE NIECES IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THE ECCENTRIC BUT KINDLY OLD FELLOW HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAKING THESE THREE GIRLS AS HAPPY AS THEIR DISPOSITIONS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO BE
NOR HAD GOTTEN ANY THING READY FOR FIGHTING THE SOLDIERS FELL UPON THEM AND SLEW THEM ALL WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND THEN PLUNDERED AND BURNT THE CITY THE NUMBER OF THE SLAIN WAS EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED IN LIKE MANNER
AND EVEN WHEN ONE OF THOSE SUBTLER CHARACTERS DRAWS NEAR ABOUT WHOM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IMMEDIATELY WHETHER THEY REQUIRE A FOUNTAIN PEN WITH CASE OR THE LIFE AND LETTERS
SHE HER EMILY FELT AS IF SHE WAS PASSING THROUGH ANOTHER NIGHTMARE
SHE MUST GET USED TO ALL THIS AND NOT EXPECT TO FIND ALL THE WORLD LIKE HER OWN SUNNY MOUNTAINS THE BISHOP'S CAREFUL LITTLE WIFE HAD TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HER HOW TO MEET HER NEW EXPERIENCES SHE WAS TO GO NOWHERE ALONE
BUT WINTER WITH ALL ITS GRIMNESS AND STERNNESS IN THE GREAT COLD STONE WALLED CASTLES OF THOSE DAYS THE ONLY FIRE AND ALMOST THE ONLY LIGHT WERE THOSE FROM THE HUGE BLAZING LOGS THAT ROARED AND CRACKLED IN THE GREAT OPEN STONE FIREPLACE
OR RATHER SEEMING TO BE DELIGHTED WITH THAT UPROAR OF THE ELEMENTS WHICH PARTIALLY CALLED OFF HIS ATTENTION FROM THE DISCORD AND DEJECTION THAT OCCUPIED HIS OWN MIND
BUT HE KNEW THAT WOULD BE THE LAST MEANS OF ATTRACTING THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO RIDE IN MOTOR CARS SLOWLY THE AUTO PASSED AND IF WE PLACE THE POETS ABOVE THE AUTOISTS CARRIED THE HEART OF REMSEN WITH IT
SHE FELT PERFECTLY FINE THEN I KNOW BUT SHE'S AN OLD CAT SHE NEVER STRAYS AWAY OF HER OWN ACCORD AND CERTAINLV NO ONE WOULD STEAL AN OLD BLIND CAT
IT WAS IN THIS MOOD EXHAUSTED BY A VISIT TO HIS LAWYER THAT HE STEPPED INTO A MILITARY CLUB AND TOOK UP A NEWSPAPER CARING LITTLE FOR POLITICS HIS EYE WANDERED OVER UNINTERESTED
WM WALTERS CARPENTER'S CREW WM JONES DOG DRIVER
I UNDERSTAND OF COURSE IN WHAT CHARACTER I AM SITTING BEFORE YOU
ONLY THAT HE'S TOO FAMILIAR WELL NOW AND THE SHORT AND LONG OF IT CAPTAIN ASKED THE DOCTOR TELL US WHAT YOU WANT WELL GENTLEMEN
LIKE TWILIGHT'S TOO HER DUSKY HAIR BUT ALL THINGS ELSE ABOUT HER DRAWN FROM MAY TIME AND THE CHEERFUL DAWN A DANCING SHAPE AN IMAGE GAY TO HAUNT TO STARTLE AND WAYLAY
O AMY DON'T DO ALL THIS LET ME RING NO THE SERVANTS ARE EITHER NOT COME HOME OR ARE TOO BUSY CHARLES WON'T WANT ME HE HAS GUY CAN I FIND YOUR WHITE FROCK OH BUT AMY LET ME SEE
OR IF WE SHOULD NOT ASCRIBE THESE PRINCIPLES WHOLLY TO A CORRUPTED HEART WE MUST AT LEAST ACCOUNT FOR THEM FROM THE MOST CARELESS AND PRECIPITATE EXAMINATION
AND TURNING TO THE TWO BROTHERS HE SAID HE HAS CERTAINLY ACCOMPLISHED THE FIRST TASK WITH THE AID NO DOUBT OF HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC BUT WHAT SHALL WE GIVE HIM TO DO NOW
SUBSTANCE ABSOLUTELY INFINITE IS INDIVISIBLE PROOF IF IT COULD BE DIVIDED THE PARTS INTO WHICH IT WAS DIVIDED WOULD EITHER RETAIN THE NATURE OF ABSOLUTELY INFINITE SUBSTANCE OR THEY WOULD NOT
PLEASE CONTINUE TO BE FRANK PLEASE DO NOT THINK I AM ASKING OUT OF MERE CURIOSITY PLEASE FORGIVE MY THOUGHTLESSNESS PLEASE MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME
MANY A NIGHT HAVE I GOT UP TO SEE IF THE WIND HAD NOT CHANGED AND CHANGED IT HAD SURE ENOUGH BUT YOU NEVER CAME I REMEMBER SO WELL ONE DAY WHEN THE RAIN WAS POURING DOWN IN TORRENTS THE SCAVENGERS WERE BEFORE THE HOUSE WHERE I WAS IN SERVICE
WE HAVE ONE BAD HABIT
AND CLOUDIE IN ASPECT THUS ANSWERING SPAKE DELIVERER FROM NEW LORDS LEADER TO FREE ENJOYMENT OF OUR RIGHT AS GODS YET HARD FOR GODS AND TOO UNEQUAL WORK WE FIND AGAINST UNEQUAL ARMES TO FIGHT IN PAINE
HE BOWED HIS HEAD BEHIND HIS MASTER AND WITHOUT STIRRING HELD HILT UP OVER HIS RIGHT SHOULDER A LONG BLADE IN A SILVER SCABBARD HE WAS THERE ON DUTY
MEASURED BY THE PRISONER'S EXPERIENCE HOWEVER
HER FATHER AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT SLACKENED HIS PACE AND FELL INTO THAT HEAVY LISTLESS STEP WHICH TOLD AS WELL AS WORDS COULD DO OF HOPELESSNESS AND WEAKNESS IT WAS GETTING DARK BUT HE LOITERED ON
REGARDLESS OF THE MISCHIEVOUSNESS AND MALICIOUSNESS THAT SO OFTEN ENSUE NEARLY EVERY CHRISTIAN CHURCH INFLICTS AS MUCH DISCREDIT AND INJUSTICE AS IT CAN CONTRIVE UPON THE ILLEGITIMATE CHILD
